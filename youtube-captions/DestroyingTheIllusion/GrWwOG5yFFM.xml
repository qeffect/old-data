  <text start="80.64" dur="3.39">lot of stuff happening that I&amp;#39;m super</text>

  <text start="85.29" dur="5.55">excited about too so that&amp;#39;s that and I</text>
  <text start="88.89" dur="4.229">mean where should we begin talking about</text>
  <text start="90.84" dur="3.239">what&amp;#39;s been happening this week I guess</text>
  <text start="93.119" dur="5.101">we could just start off with the IG</text>
  <text start="94.079" dur="8.011">report that dropping and then Horowitz</text>
  <text start="98.22" dur="7.59">is testimony the other day and I watched</text>
  <text start="102.09" dur="5.43">it live which is very important to do</text>
  <text start="105.81" dur="3">with things like this you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="107.52" dur="3.419">there&amp;#39;s a reason why I don&amp;#39;t pay for</text>
  <text start="108.81" dur="3.51">cable anymore and just watch everything</text>
  <text start="110.939" dur="3.601">that&amp;#39;s important like that live on the</text>
  <text start="112.32" dur="6.14">Internet because apparently the</text>
  <text start="114.54" dur="6.329">mainstream media they didn&amp;#39;t even show</text>
  <text start="118.46" dur="4.689">hardly any of it they only showed like a</text>
  <text start="120.869" dur="4.081">third of the whole thing I mean it was</text>
  <text start="123.149" dur="5.161">long but the only showed a third of it</text>
  <text start="124.95" dur="5.429">and apparently they didn&amp;#39;t even show the</text>
  <text start="128.31" dur="3.09">gops opening statement I think that was</text>
  <text start="130.379" dur="3.031">Lindsey Graham they didn&amp;#39;t even show</text>
  <text start="131.4" dur="5.46">Lindsey Graham&amp;#39;s opening statement which</text>
  <text start="133.41" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s crucial to do to get of course the</text>
  <text start="136.86" dur="2.82">full picture because it was like a night</text>
  <text start="138.36" dur="3.36">and day difference when I was watching</text>
  <text start="139.68" dur="4.26">this thing I really just watched grams</text>
  <text start="141.72" dur="4.41">opening statement Diane Feinstein and</text>
  <text start="143.94" dur="4.14">then Horowitz has questions and it kept</text>
  <text start="146.13" dur="3.72">going up on and on I checked in on it</text>
  <text start="148.08" dur="4.5">later but night and day difference every</text>
  <text start="149.85" dur="5.37">time you saw a Republican up there</text>
  <text start="152.58" dur="6.09">versus one of the DS one of the</text>
  <text start="155.22" dur="5.31">Democrats it was like night and day and</text>
  <text start="158.67" dur="4.26">every time you had one of those deep</text>
  <text start="160.53" dur="3.81">state folk up there they were nervous</text>
  <text start="162.93" dur="3.06">and it was all the same talking points</text>
  <text start="164.34" dur="4.65">that they were trying to get they were</text>
  <text start="165.99" dur="4.92">banking on that so mr. Horowitz you</text>
  <text start="168.99" dur="4.95">found that there was no deep state</text>
  <text start="170.91" dur="5.43">conspiracy no deep state conspiracy mr.</text>
  <text start="173.94" dur="5.58">Horowitz you found right here you said</text>
  <text start="176.34" dur="5.34">there was no testimonial bias that you</text>
  <text start="179.52" dur="5.64">found in this report and Horowitz was</text>
  <text start="181.68" dur="7.23">like well all this conduct here is</text>
  <text start="185.16" dur="6.48">totally it&amp;#39;s absurd this is crazy stuff</text>
  <text start="188.91" dur="4.74">and shouldn&amp;#39;t have happened</text>
  <text start="191.64" dur="6.15">and the rules we have kind of suck we</text>
  <text start="193.65" dur="6.86">need to change all that but he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="197.79" dur="5.49">you know Horowitz was playing the the</text>
  <text start="200.51" dur="3.94">impartial beyond biased so he couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="203.28" dur="2.91">say do you say conspiracy but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="204.45" dur="4.47">what they were banking on and that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="206.19" dur="5.67">you saw running in the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="208.92" dur="5.07">yesterday was just four which denies</text>
  <text start="211.86" dur="7.29">deep state conspiracy or was you know</text>
  <text start="213.99" dur="6.24">deep state conspiracy is crazy stuff so</text>
  <text start="219.15" dur="2.37">they were going for those talking points</text>
  <text start="220.23" dur="4.35">those narratives that they were trying</text>
  <text start="221.52" dur="5.46">to try to point out but Horowitz if you</text>
  <text start="224.58" dur="4.41">actually just listen to his words he was</text>
  <text start="226.98" dur="4.74">basically yeah this conduct we saw it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="228.99" dur="5.46">crazy stuff and sure we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="231.72" dur="4.74">testimonial evidence of bias because we</text>
  <text start="234.45" dur="3.93">didn&amp;#39;t investigate everything</text>
  <text start="236.46" dur="4.56">Durham&amp;#39;s out there with a whole lot more</text>
  <text start="238.38" dur="6.33">information that I didn&amp;#39;t get access to</text>
  <text start="241.02" dur="6.42">and sure if you you know don&amp;#39;t look at</text>
  <text start="244.71" dur="5.51">it through the spin yeah I could see</text>
  <text start="247.44" dur="4.77">Horowitz not finding evidence of bias</text>
  <text start="250.22" dur="3.19">testimonial evidence of bias well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="252.21" dur="5.25">because he&amp;#39;s talking to a bunch of</text>
  <text start="253.41" dur="5.85">Spooks you expect the spooks to tell you</text>
  <text start="257.46" dur="3.959">the truth and then show their bias so</text>
  <text start="259.26" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s you know quite obvious what they</text>
  <text start="261.419" dur="3.81">were trying to do just spin the story</text>
  <text start="262.62" dur="3.92">but just listening to the words and what</text>
  <text start="265.229" dur="3.681">was said and everything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="266.54" dur="4.77">out this week it&amp;#39;s plainly obvious that</text>
  <text start="268.91" dur="4.44">this is gonna keep rolling you know we</text>
  <text start="271.31" dur="5.34">have this FISA IG report that the public</text>
  <text start="273.35" dur="4.92">is gonna have to digest in the coming</text>
  <text start="276.65" dur="3.68">weeks maybe even a couple months but</text>
  <text start="278.27" dur="6.09">it&amp;#39;s been said that derms report is</text>
  <text start="280.33" dur="5.82">slated for like late spring late spring</text>
  <text start="284.36" dur="5.34">maybe early summer so we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="286.15" dur="5.56">April May June there may be yeah that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="289.7" dur="3.63">a pretty quick turnaround cuz Durham&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="291.71" dur="5.94">not just gonna bring a report he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="293.33" dur="5.61">bring prosecutions and indictments that</text>
  <text start="297.65" dur="2.64">we&amp;#39;ll be seeing in the coming months we</text>
  <text start="298.94" dur="4.86">might even see some of those here soon</text>
  <text start="300.29" dur="5.63">so credible stuff credible stuff seeing</text>
  <text start="303.8" dur="6.54">that and then the spin that happened and</text>
  <text start="305.92" dur="6.34">you know it&amp;#39;s crazy that this is going</text>
  <text start="310.34" dur="4.05">on at the same time as the impeachment</text>
  <text start="312.26" dur="5.19">here it&amp;#39;s quite honestly you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="314.39" dur="4.92">like half of me when you hear dates and</text>
  <text start="317.45" dur="4.26">things get mentioned that they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="319.31" dur="5.88">drop like the IG report have to use like</text>
  <text start="321.71" dur="4.95">uh maybe that&amp;#39;s like a disinformation as</text>
  <text start="325.19" dur="3.81">necessary thing we&amp;#39;ll see if it actually</text>
  <text start="326.66" dur="3.93">drops on that day so part of me how much</text>
  <text start="329" dur="3.72">was surprised at the IG report dropped</text>
  <text start="330.59" dur="4.47">but it did so now we&amp;#39;re past that stage</text>
  <text start="332.72" dur="4.86">and it&amp;#39;s happening at the exact same</text>
  <text start="335.06" dur="5.79">time as these impeachment inquiries that</text>
  <text start="337.58" dur="4.53">are going on which is really when you</text>
  <text start="340.85" dur="5.28">think about it from the big picture</text>
  <text start="342.11" dur="7.47">point of view very helpful to do very</text>
  <text start="346.13" dur="5.28">strategic because on one hand the public</text>
  <text start="349.58" dur="4.38">will be getting what they&amp;#39;re hearing</text>
  <text start="351.41" dur="3.93">about FISA of course there&amp;#39;s information</text>
  <text start="353.96" dur="2.97">warfare associated with that we have to</text>
  <text start="355.34" dur="2.52">get them the truth about it but they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="356.93" dur="3.12">be seeing a lot of this information</text>
  <text start="357.86" dur="4.53">about the IG report and like what the</text>
  <text start="360.05" dur="5.4">heck were these people freakin doing why</text>
  <text start="362.39" dur="5.25">was you know why were emails literate</text>
  <text start="365.45" dur="5.78">being altered and all this stuff</text>
  <text start="367.64" dur="5.67">happening to spy on President Trump and</text>
  <text start="371.23" dur="3.46">people associate with this campaign so</text>
  <text start="373.31" dur="2.97">be they&amp;#39;ll be seeing that and at the</text>
  <text start="374.69" dur="3.33">same time they&amp;#39;ll be seeing these just</text>
  <text start="376.28" dur="3.45">crazy people in these impeachment</text>
  <text start="378.02" dur="6.03">hearings just all sorts of stuff like</text>
  <text start="379.73" dur="5.79">Jerry now they&amp;#39;re drooling and the facts</text>
  <text start="384.05" dur="3.93">that aren&amp;#39;t there like they&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="385.52" dur="4.31">nothing so it&amp;#39;ll become a choice for</text>
  <text start="387.98" dur="4.38">them you know they&amp;#39;ll have these two</text>
  <text start="389.83" dur="6.25">sort of realities in their consciousness</text>
  <text start="392.36" dur="5.79">at the same time and as it progresses</text>
  <text start="396.08" dur="3.27">it&amp;#39;s just going to continue that whoa</text>
  <text start="398.15" dur="4.38">these impeachment hearing</text>
  <text start="399.35" dur="5.55">like yeah there&amp;#39;s there seems to be a</text>
  <text start="402.53" dur="4.88">reason why they&amp;#39;re trying so damn hard</text>
  <text start="404.9" dur="5.01">to get Trump out of office right now</text>
  <text start="407.41" dur="5.62">whoa what&amp;#39;s this IG report all about</text>
  <text start="409.91" dur="6.74">same time like maybe that&amp;#39;s why right so</text>
  <text start="413.03" dur="5.76">that&amp;#39;s kind of how you have to go about</text>
  <text start="416.65" dur="3.34">seeing the optics of these things</text>
  <text start="418.79" dur="2.79">because it really is a big picture point</text>
  <text start="419.99" dur="4.44">of view and we&amp;#39;re trying to get a lot of</text>
  <text start="421.58" dur="4.17">people to start seeing this stuff and</text>

  <text start="428.99" dur="4.23">really going on so shoot that&amp;#39;s why Q</text>
  <text start="431.57" dur="3.78">came on scene a few years ago that&amp;#39;s why</text>

  <text start="687.81" dur="5.31">change models to formulate that and then</text>
  <text start="690.86" dur="5.14">the science is and there&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="693.12" dur="4.08">different things they don&amp;#39;t take into</text>

  <text start="1182.87" dur="4.11">occurring and it&amp;#39;s continuing to occur</text>
  <text start="1184.73" dur="4.439">and you know it&amp;#39;s happening with cue</text>
  <text start="1186.98" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s happening with so much of this</text>
  <text start="1189.169" dur="4.89">corruption that&amp;#39;s being exposed with you</text>
  <text start="1191.84" dur="3.48">know the honest media that we have in</text>
  <text start="1194.059" dur="2.791">this society</text>
  <text start="1195.32" dur="4.8">that&amp;#39;s happening with the space horse -</text>
  <text start="1196.85" dur="5.88">and the space force of course we know is</text>
  <text start="1200.12" dur="4.29">already it&amp;#39;s already there there&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1202.73" dur="3.42">billions if not trillions of dollars</text>
  <text start="1204.41" dur="4.56">that have been funneled into black</text>
  <text start="1206.15" dur="6.12">projects and there they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1208.97" dur="6.42">developing some crazy stuff for decades</text>
  <text start="1212.27" dur="5.97">decades now but the point of the space</text>
  <text start="1215.39" dur="5.22">force is a complete white hat chess move</text>
  <text start="1218.24" dur="4.83">to number one gain access to these</text>
  <text start="1220.61" dur="4.59">programs because these programs have</text>
  <text start="1223.07" dur="4.56">been kept so off the books and outside</text>
  <text start="1225.2" dur="5.73">of congressional oversight and outside</text>
  <text start="1227.63" dur="4.8">outside of the oversight of a lot of</text>
  <text start="1230.93" dur="4.08">people even in the frickin airforce and</text>
  <text start="1232.43" dur="3.93">the DIA and the CIA in the Intel</text>
  <text start="1235.01" dur="3.36">community of the military whatnot so</text>
  <text start="1236.36" dur="5.27">they have to find where these programs</text>
  <text start="1238.37" dur="5.94">are gain access to them acquire them</text>
  <text start="1241.63" dur="7.06">bring them in to somewhere that they can</text>
  <text start="1244.31" dur="6.75">control and then begin the process of</text>
  <text start="1248.69" dur="6.12">disclosing these things to humanity and</text>
  <text start="1251.06" dur="7.79">it&amp;#39;s a very slow process because as</text>
  <text start="1254.81" dur="6.09">there&amp;#39;s such massive mind blowing I mean</text>
  <text start="1258.85" dur="4.33">we&amp;#39;re talking about redoing your</text>
  <text start="1260.9" dur="3.9">understanding of physics gravity is</text>
  <text start="1263.18" dur="4.14">controllable gravity is not what we</text>
  <text start="1264.8" dur="5.94">think it&amp;#39;s not fake and space isn&amp;#39;t fake</text>
  <text start="1267.32" dur="6.63">and the earth isn&amp;#39;t flat but there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1270.74" dur="4.38">lot of redoing of understanding sciences</text>
  <text start="1273.95" dur="3.03">that we need to do and not just that but</text>
  <text start="1275.12" dur="3.75">reenter standing history like what did</text>

  <text start="1294.02" dur="5.7">gonna be a it&amp;#39;s gonna take a little bit</text>
  <text start="1295.82" dur="5.67">but these baby steps aren&amp;#39;t even really</text>
  <text start="1299.72" dur="4.02">baby steps because the space force that</text>
  <text start="1301.49" dur="4.58">just being created funded brought to</text>
  <text start="1303.74" dur="6.03">fruition to make it a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1306.07" dur="5.29">start thinking outside the box and it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1328.28" dur="5.58">and fear and stuff in our subconscious</text>
  <text start="1330.77" dur="8.24">it&amp;#39;s making them start to work out of</text>
  <text start="1333.86" dur="8.76">that so it&amp;#39;s fantastic and you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1339.01" dur="5.62">in looking at the information warfare</text>

  <text start="1344.63" dur="7.2">space one thing that you need to be</text>
  <text start="1347.87" dur="6.21">aware of that I see quite a bit is the</text>

  <text start="1419.26" dur="5.35">it&amp;#39;s kind of paradoxically a lot more</text>
  <text start="1421.76" dur="6.09">simple and complex at the same time but</text>
  <text start="1424.61" dur="6.99">you really have to just do the due</text>

  <text start="1450.98" dur="4.74">if you will if you want to call it that</text>
  <text start="1452.12" dur="6.63">and sure there&amp;#39;s probably negative like</text>

  <text start="1460.7" dur="4.23">good ones to hear trying to help us and</text>
  <text start="1462.62" dur="5.1">then in terms of space technology if you</text>
  <text start="1464.93" dur="6.8">want to talk that some people think oh</text>
  <text start="1467.72" dur="8.31">no technology exists to get to the moon</text>
