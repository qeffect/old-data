  <text start="8.45" dur="3.64">so I got a neat video for you guys today</text>
  <text start="10.62" dur="3.769">and what I&amp;#39;m gonna discuss with you is</text>
  <text start="12.09" dur="4.74">ascension symptoms because this is a</text>
  <text start="14.389" dur="3.761">topic that I&amp;#39;ve seen pop up a lot lately</text>
  <text start="16.83" dur="3.81">a lot of people have been discussing it</text>
  <text start="18.15" dur="5.639">so I want to give you my opinions on it</text>
  <text start="20.64" dur="4.979">now when it comes to Ascension symptoms</text>
  <text start="23.789" dur="4.051">what does that essentially mean</text>
  <text start="25.619" dur="5.761">ascension symptoms is a term that a lot</text>
  <text start="27.84" dur="7.86">of people use to describe their feelings</text>
  <text start="31.38" dur="5.85">of discomfort in adjusting to these new</text>
  <text start="35.7" dur="3.03">energies and these new vibrations that</text>
  <text start="37.23" dur="4.19">are going on on our planet so basically</text>
  <text start="38.73" dur="5.97">just feeling weird feeling off because</text>
  <text start="41.42" dur="7.299">there&amp;#39;s crazy energetics going on in the</text>
  <text start="44.7" dur="7.249">cosmos and essentially I mean really</text>
  <text start="48.719" dur="6.211">what I believe I don&amp;#39;t really believe in</text>
  <text start="51.949" dur="5.801">ascension symptoms per se I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="54.93" dur="5.039">any kinds of disease or dysfunction just</text>
  <text start="57.75" dur="3.87">happen I think there&amp;#39;s always a cause</text>
  <text start="59.969" dur="3.09">and effect and I don&amp;#39;t like to call it</text>
  <text start="61.62" dur="4.74">acceptance symptoms what I personally</text>
  <text start="63.059" dur="5.431">call it is out of alignment during</text>
  <text start="66.36" dur="4.65">Ascension symptoms because if you look</text>
  <text start="68.49" dur="4.169">at the word dis-ease your your dis your</text>
  <text start="71.01" dur="4.499">a dis ease right something&amp;#39;s not working</text>
  <text start="72.659" dur="4.981">right because you&amp;#39;re out of alignment so</text>
  <text start="75.509" dur="3.841">what I&amp;#39;m gonna discuss with you is what</text>
  <text start="77.64" dur="3.45">I call here the six pillars of health</text>
  <text start="79.35" dur="5.25">and this is essentially just going to be</text>
  <text start="81.09" dur="4.58">a holistic health lesson you could say I</text>
  <text start="84.6" dur="5.059">mean I&amp;#39;m just gonna run through</text>
  <text start="85.67" dur="8.79">basically everything a person needs to</text>
  <text start="89.659" dur="7.931">think about and balance in their</text>
  <text start="94.46" dur="4.839">mind/body/spirit complex to best ride</text>
  <text start="97.59" dur="4.279">this wave of change that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="99.299" dur="5.371">that&amp;#39;s the best way I can describe it so</text>
  <text start="101.869" dur="7.991">I&amp;#39;m just gonna touch on each of these</text>
  <text start="104.67" dur="7.29">six pillars three of them is how we use</text>
  <text start="109.86" dur="4.14">energy in our bodies and three of them</text>
  <text start="111.96" dur="5.1">are is essentially how we gain energy so</text>
  <text start="114" dur="5.909">it&amp;#39;s almost a yin-yang between three</text>
  <text start="117.06" dur="4.89">pillars we use to expend and three we</text>
  <text start="119.909" dur="4.081">grow with so you could say these are the</text>
  <text start="121.95" dur="4.529">masculine pillars the pillars that are</text>
  <text start="123.99" dur="3.69">meant to cannibalize and break down and</text>
  <text start="126.479" dur="5.461">these are the ones that are meant to</text>
  <text start="127.68" dur="5.04">make us anabolic or regrow ourselves so</text>
  <text start="131.94" dur="2.49">it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="132.72" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s a yin-yang duality kind of a</text>
  <text start="134.43" dur="3.48">balance here between them and then in</text>
  <text start="136.44" dur="3.63">each of them I just wrote down a few</text>
  <text start="137.91" dur="3.69">things that I mean I think everybody</text>
  <text start="140.07" dur="2.55">should be aware of and be thinking about</text>
  <text start="141.6" dur="4.53">when they&amp;#39;re trying to make themselves</text>
  <text start="142.62" dur="4.83">healthier and basically just stronger</text>
  <text start="146.13" dur="3.57">versions of themselves stronger</text>
  <text start="147.45" dur="6.18">individuals so six pillars of health</text>
  <text start="149.7" dur="6.36">boom it&amp;#39;s really cheesy I love it first</text>
  <text start="153.63" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;ll do the red boxes over here and</text>
  <text start="156.06" dur="5.16">these ones are essentially move think</text>
  <text start="158.46" dur="5.19">and breathe it&amp;#39;s how you move how you</text>
  <text start="161.22" dur="8.43">think and how you breathe are always</text>
  <text start="163.65" dur="8.94">that you use energy with and essentially</text>
  <text start="169.65" dur="5.28">what you want to do is minimize the</text>
  <text start="172.59" dur="4.8">energy that you need to expend or</text>
  <text start="174.93" dur="5.19">essentially know how to expend that</text>
  <text start="177.39" dur="5.01">energy properly I should say so when we</text>
  <text start="180.12" dur="5.04">move I mean a lot of people these days</text>
  <text start="182.4" dur="4.68">just simply have muscular imbalances</text>
  <text start="185.16" dur="4.5">Riddell all over their bodies and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="187.08" dur="5.04">causing really bad postures and a lot of</text>
  <text start="189.66" dur="5.58">joint pains and things like that because</text>
  <text start="192.12" dur="5.43">when it comes to your physical body I</text>
  <text start="195.24" dur="3.93">wrote down here static posture static</text>
  <text start="197.55" dur="5.43">postural balance and your static posture</text>
  <text start="199.17" dur="6.24">is essentially how you stand there right</text>
  <text start="202.98" dur="6.66">how your body situates itself when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="205.41" dur="6.99">at rest and this is the point in which</text>
  <text start="209.64" dur="5.01">all movement stems from so if you have a</text>
  <text start="212.4" dur="3.72">really bad posture it&amp;#39;s gonna be really</text>
  <text start="214.65" dur="2.67">tough to move your joints aren&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="216.12" dur="3.03">to be able to move through their full</text>
  <text start="217.32" dur="3.78">range of motion and you&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="219.15" dur="3.869">locked up somewhere a lot of people get</text>
  <text start="221.1" dur="3.63">frozen shoulders you&amp;#39;ll get hip</text>
  <text start="223.019" dur="2.791">impingement shoulder impingements all</text>
  <text start="224.73" dur="4.11">kinds of different things</text>
  <text start="225.81" dur="4.29">joint pain and muscular tension is</text>
  <text start="228.84" dur="3.27">associated with these muscular</text>
  <text start="230.1" dur="4.5">imbalances because your muscles are</text>
  <text start="232.11" dur="5.61">essentially like a lever and on one side</text>
  <text start="234.6" dur="5.609">if you over develop that side by using</text>
  <text start="237.72" dur="7.14">it a lot the other side&amp;#39;s gonna get very</text>
  <text start="240.209" dur="5.911">very weak in the best the best metaphor</text>
  <text start="244.86" dur="3.9">the best thing I can show you right now</text>
  <text start="246.12" dur="4.8">is essentially my shoulder girdle right</text>
  <text start="248.76" dur="4.02">here and I&amp;#39;ll make more videos again on</text>
  <text start="250.92" dur="3.27">like each of these topics maybe this</text>
  <text start="252.78" dur="3.06">will be a series right this will be like</text>
  <text start="254.19" dur="3.18">the first overview and I&amp;#39;ll get more in</text>
  <text start="255.84" dur="3.119">depth into each of these but essentially</text>
  <text start="257.37" dur="3.39">what you want to do is balance your</text>
  <text start="258.959" dur="4.381">structural frame so if I have a very</text>
  <text start="260.76" dur="4.65">tight chest which many people do because</text>
  <text start="263.34" dur="2.94">what do you do all the time sit at desks</text>
  <text start="265.41" dur="2.58">drive cars</text>
  <text start="266.28" dur="4.59">we have our shoulders and flex positions</text>
  <text start="267.99" dur="4.65">per se which is public tips so our chest</text>
  <text start="270.87" dur="4.47">muscles become very tight they become</text>
  <text start="272.64" dur="4.95">chronically tight and always want to</text>
  <text start="275.34" dur="4.08">yank our shoulder forward so you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="277.59" dur="4.14">a lot of people walking around with a</text>
  <text start="279.42" dur="4.62">rounded shoulder posture and this puts a</text>
  <text start="281.73" dur="4.32">lot of stress on your rotator cuff and</text>
  <text start="284.04" dur="3.69">crazy a lot creates a lot of imbalance</text>
  <text start="286.05" dur="3.51">around your your whole shoulder girdle</text>
  <text start="287.73" dur="5.37">and your neck and basically everything I</text>
  <text start="289.56" dur="7.59">mean our biomechanics work as a holistic</text>
  <text start="293.1" dur="5.85">system so that&amp;#39;s very crucial to balance</text>
  <text start="297.15" dur="4.74">our physical body with right your whole</text>
  <text start="298.95" dur="4.68">your brain your your everything your</text>
  <text start="301.89" dur="4.32">heart will work better with better</text>
  <text start="303.63" dur="4.41">posture so very crucial there in the</text>
  <text start="306.21" dur="3.57">Nitro dynamic movement balance and this</text>
  <text start="308.04" dur="3.51">is basically when you throw a motion</text>
  <text start="309.78" dur="3.75">into the mix when you take static</text>
  <text start="311.55" dur="4.65">posture and throw time movement into the</text>
  <text start="313.53" dur="4.98">mix this is how all of your muscles</text>
  <text start="316.2" dur="5.46">basically sync up so this is your</text>
  <text start="318.51" dur="4.56">kinetic chain firing at the specific</text>
  <text start="321.66" dur="4.02">intervals at which it should to make</text>
  <text start="323.07" dur="5.49">movement happen properly so what I mean</text>
  <text start="325.68" dur="4.23">by this is say you go down to squat if</text>
  <text start="328.56" dur="3.09">you have a lot of imbalances around your</text>
  <text start="329.91" dur="3.509">hips your knees could flare out and</text>
  <text start="331.65" dur="3.96">every time you squat you could be</text>
  <text start="333.419" dur="3.961">putting way too much pressure then you</text>
  <text start="335.61" dur="3.84">should be doing on your knees so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="337.38" dur="3.72">just one example again I can go much</text>
  <text start="339.45" dur="4.59">more in-depth into this in later videos</text>
  <text start="341.1" dur="5.49">next we&amp;#39;ll move into thinking thinking</text>
  <text start="344.04" dur="4.92">is I mean I just kind of wrote down some</text>
  <text start="346.59" dur="5.13">general things here that I think will be</text>
  <text start="348.96" dur="5.25">helpful to think better I think think</text>
  <text start="351.72" dur="4.68">they think left and right brain balance</text>
  <text start="354.21" dur="3.51">okay and I&amp;#39;ve done I&amp;#39;ve mentioned this</text>
  <text start="356.4" dur="3.3">in some of my videos but basically just</text>
  <text start="357.72" dur="4.08">balancing the logical side of our brains</text>
  <text start="359.7" dur="5.219">with the intuitive side of our brains</text>
  <text start="361.8" dur="4.98">and understanding that ego complex that</text>
  <text start="364.919" dur="3.841">loves to reside in that left brain part</text>
  <text start="366.78" dur="5.82">of us so I mean that&amp;#39;s just important to</text>
  <text start="368.76" dur="6">me to hone proper discernment skills and</text>
  <text start="372.6" dur="3.48">to think better essentially and then I</text>
  <text start="374.76" dur="4.23">wrote also wrote down emotional</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="5.07">intelligence and this is again just</text>
  <text start="378.99" dur="4.77">understanding who you are understanding</text>
  <text start="381.15" dur="5.25">your own emotions how it comes out how</text>
  <text start="383.76" dur="4.65">you repress emotions that&amp;#39;s a big thing</text>
  <text start="386.4" dur="4.35">we do in this day and age is we repress</text>
  <text start="388.41" dur="4.5">a lot of stuff in us now causes a lot of</text>
  <text start="390.75" dur="5.01">internal spiritual tensions that then</text>
  <text start="392.91" dur="4.83">manifest into physical pains but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="395.76" dur="3.6">the unfortunately with modern medicine</text>
  <text start="397.74" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s the physical pains they always</text>
  <text start="399.36" dur="6.029">look at not the emotional or spiritual</text>
  <text start="402.96" dur="4.229">issues so there&amp;#39;s always deeper stuff</text>
  <text start="405.389" dur="4.56">going on if you have a physical pain and</text>
  <text start="407.189" dur="4.591">then reading and meditation so really</text>
  <text start="409.949" dur="3.411">when it comes to thinking you want to</text>
  <text start="411.78" dur="3.629">use your brain but you also want to</text>
  <text start="413.36" dur="5.769">meditation is crucial actually I threw</text>
  <text start="415.409" dur="7.171">that into thinking one but meditation</text>
  <text start="419.129" dur="4.711">just simply connecting to that which is</text>
  <text start="422.58" dur="5.16">I mean connecting to your higher self</text>
  <text start="423.84" dur="5.639">through quieting quieting this incessant</text>
  <text start="427.74" dur="4.769">thing we got between our shoulders here</text>
  <text start="429.479" dur="4.44">so those are just some helpful tips I</text>
  <text start="432.509" dur="3.81">wrote down to thinking I kind of waned</text>
  <text start="433.919" dur="3.99">that one or just through I mean I threw</text>
  <text start="436.319" dur="3.57">out my own opinions over there and then</text>
  <text start="437.909" dur="4.47">breathing and all I wrote down here is</text>
  <text start="439.889" dur="3.96">conscious breathing exercises and this</text>
  <text start="442.379" dur="3.57">kind of tied breathing ties into</text>
  <text start="443.849" dur="5.401">thinking and actually moving quite a bit</text>
  <text start="445.949" dur="6.301">I mean again holistic symptoms we are</text>
  <text start="449.25" dur="4.86">holistic systems our body our mind body</text>
  <text start="452.25" dur="4.259">spirit complex is a system of systems</text>
  <text start="454.11" dur="5.01">not only do we move holistically we</text>
  <text start="456.509" dur="3.87">should think holistically and basically</text>
  <text start="459.12" dur="2.759">live our lives holistically because</text>
  <text start="460.379" dur="4.111">everything&amp;#39;s connected as all the best</text>
  <text start="461.879" dur="4.32">scientists and doctors and physicists</text>
  <text start="464.49" dur="4.049">show does everything&amp;#39;s connected so</text>
  <text start="466.199" dur="4.741">breathing when it comes to breathing</text>
  <text start="468.539" dur="4.951">tangent aside conscious breathing</text>
  <text start="470.94" dur="6.629">exercises are extremely helpful because</text>
  <text start="473.49" dur="7.47">as the basically what I want to say is</text>
  <text start="477.569" dur="5.671">we are a very stressed-out society and</text>
  <text start="480.96" dur="3.929">when we tend to be in that perpetual</text>
  <text start="483.24" dur="2.609">stress response that fight-or-flight</text>
  <text start="484.889" dur="3.78">response</text>
  <text start="485.849" dur="4.051">we will breathe with our chest we will</text>
  <text start="488.669" dur="3.84">do what&amp;#39;s called labored breathing</text>
  <text start="489.9" dur="5.819">you&amp;#39;ll see people&amp;#39;s neck muscles start</text>
  <text start="492.509" dur="5.25">to actually contract because it&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="495.719" dur="3.991">to raise their diaphragm from the chest</text>
  <text start="497.759" dur="4.59">and when we become perpetual of chest</text>
  <text start="499.71" dur="3.989">breathers that will stimulate too many</text>
  <text start="502.349" dur="3">stress hormones that will actually</text>
  <text start="503.699" dur="3.361">stimulate norepinephrine and epinephrine</text>
  <text start="505.349" dur="3.66">response from your adrenal glands and</text>
  <text start="507.06" dur="3.84">you&amp;#39;ll these basically stressed out all</text>
  <text start="509.009" dur="3.751">the freaking time you&amp;#39;ll breathe</text>
  <text start="510.9" dur="3.48">stressed out and then your breathing</text>
  <text start="512.76" dur="3.24">will release more stress hormones in</text>
  <text start="514.38" dur="3.389">your body and be more stressed out and</text>
  <text start="516" dur="4.199">it&amp;#39;s you see the perpetual cycle that</text>
  <text start="517.769" dur="4.111">happens so when it comes to conscious</text>
  <text start="520.199" dur="3.39">breathing exercises really that means</text>
  <text start="521.88" dur="4.139">just focusing your breath from your</text>
  <text start="523.589" dur="4.73">navel and from your belly essentially</text>
  <text start="526.019" dur="4.501">and then breathing from your diaphragm</text>
  <text start="528.319" dur="3.871">diaphragmatic breathing that will</text>
  <text start="530.52" dur="4.16">stimulate your rest</text>
  <text start="532.19" dur="4.35">digest response or what&amp;#39;s also known as</text>
  <text start="534.68" dur="4.769">your parasympathetic nervous system and</text>
  <text start="536.54" dur="4.349">basically help recover you so deep</text>
  <text start="539.449" dur="4.411">conscious breathing exercises will help</text>
  <text start="540.889" dur="4.14">you recover that&amp;#39;s what my two minutes</text>
  <text start="543.86" dur="4.829">of yadda-yadda-yadda</text>
  <text start="545.029" dur="5.04">basically boiled down to so look into</text>
  <text start="548.689" dur="3.601">that not a lot of people actually</text>
  <text start="550.069" dur="4.25">realize with your diaphragm the muscle</text>
  <text start="552.29" dur="4.62">that literally helps you to breathe your</text>
  <text start="554.319" dur="4.541">diaphragm tendons connect into your</text>
  <text start="556.91" dur="4.109">around your l3 so that&amp;#39;s actually your</text>
  <text start="558.86" dur="4.8">low back your lumbar vertebrae so we</text>
  <text start="561.019" dur="3.87">should be breathing from the belly</text>
  <text start="563.66" dur="2.729">because that&amp;#39;s literally where our</text>
  <text start="564.889" dur="3.361">tendons attach into but so many people</text>
  <text start="566.389" dur="4.32">breathe from the chest and then that</text>
  <text start="568.25" dur="4.74">also exacerbates Morse muscle imbalances</text>
  <text start="570.709" dur="3.601">all around the neck and then the tension</text>
  <text start="572.99" dur="3.24">headaches happen because they got</text>
  <text start="574.31" dur="3.3">freakin tight necks and just whole host</text>
  <text start="576.23" dur="3.539">of issues again all of these are</text>
  <text start="577.61" dur="4.11">freaking connected so anyway that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="579.769" dur="4.081">quick rundown of these three of the</text>
  <text start="581.72" dur="7.02">three red pillars of how we use our</text>
  <text start="583.85" dur="7.44">energy too but basically what we do to</text>
  <text start="588.74" dur="5.01">expend energy and use it and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="591.29" dur="4.859">few tips on how I best think to do that</text>
  <text start="593.75" dur="5.759">and now let&amp;#39;s talk about the three</text>
  <text start="596.149" dur="6.571">pillars that we basically live our lives</text>
  <text start="599.509" dur="5.19">to build energy with and that is eating</text>
  <text start="602.72" dur="3.929">drinking and sleeping nutrition</text>
  <text start="604.699" dur="4.021">hydration and what you could call it</text>
  <text start="606.649" dur="2.731">sleep or also rip down rhythm here some</text>
  <text start="608.72" dur="3.419">people call tree-level</text>
  <text start="609.38" dur="4.8">but these three things we build energy</text>
  <text start="612.139" dur="4.2">with these are the we called the</text>
  <text start="614.18" dur="2.849">anabolic pillars or the feminine pillars</text>
  <text start="616.339" dur="2.73">per se</text>
  <text start="617.029" dur="4.261">yin and yang masculine feminine the</text>
  <text start="619.069" dur="3.481">masculine always wants to break</text>
  <text start="621.29" dur="3.27">down you think of a dude they&amp;#39;re always</text>
  <text start="622.55" dur="3.75">you know super aggressive let&amp;#39;s go break</text>
  <text start="624.56" dur="2.79"> down and then the feminine ones</text>
  <text start="626.3" dur="3.12">always want to rebuild</text>
  <text start="627.35" dur="4.979">that&amp;#39;s the anabolic part of us you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="629.42" dur="4.95">I mean they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re both crucial</text>
  <text start="632.329" dur="3.781">you can&amp;#39;t build up your body if you</text>
  <text start="634.37" dur="3.389">don&amp;#39;t break it down you can&amp;#39;t break down</text>
  <text start="636.11" dur="6.229">your body if you have nothing to build</text>
  <text start="637.759" dur="7.83">up with so it&amp;#39;s dance it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="642.339" dur="6.73">octopus arms it&amp;#39;s a very delicate dance</text>
  <text start="645.589" dur="5.73">so with these three eating drinking and</text>
  <text start="649.069" dur="4.32">sleeping what I wrote down under eating</text>
  <text start="651.319" dur="4.38">again this kind of goes along the lines</text>
  <text start="653.389" dur="3.841">of the every single body is different</text>
  <text start="655.699" dur="3.18">and you&amp;#39;re gonna have to focus</text>
  <text start="657.23" dur="3.99">differently on different pillars</text>
  <text start="658.879" dur="3.96">depending on who you are I mean the</text>
  <text start="661.22" dur="3.539">information I give is just all about</text>
  <text start="662.839" dur="2.541">self-empowerment it&amp;#39;s all up to you to</text>
  <text start="664.759" dur="2.091">use it</text>
  <text start="665.38" dur="3.39">for your own accord for your own</text>
  <text start="666.85" dur="5.13">empowerment but when it comes to eating</text>
  <text start="668.77" dur="6.6">the two things I wrote down here and uh</text>
  <text start="671.98" dur="6.51">are metabolic typing and biochemical</text>
  <text start="675.37" dur="4.53">individuality and I wish I was better at</text>
  <text start="678.49" dur="3.81">doing these videos because I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="679.9" dur="4.17">remember who wrote these books but</text>
  <text start="682.3" dur="3.39">there&amp;#39;s a guy who wrote the metabolic</text>
  <text start="684.07" dur="3.42">typing book and a guy that wrote a book</text>
  <text start="685.69" dur="4.2">called biochemical individuality and</text>
  <text start="687.49" dur="4.86">these are great books the one on</text>
  <text start="689.89" dur="8.25">biochemical into that individuality this</text>
  <text start="692.35" dur="7.71">is I think it&amp;#39;s Thunder next biochemical</text>
  <text start="698.14" dur="3.3">individuality is just a very fancy way</text>
  <text start="700.06" dur="3.24">of saying that all of our body&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="701.44" dur="5.52">different and we&amp;#39;re all gonna require</text>
  <text start="703.3" dur="5.85">different nutrient counts okay and one</text>
  <text start="706.96" dur="3.75">person might be you know their organs</text>
  <text start="709.15" dur="4.05">might literally be larger their</text>
  <text start="710.71" dur="5.01">metabolic rate might be much different</text>
  <text start="713.2" dur="6.03">than this person that&amp;#39;s also 510 that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="715.72" dur="6.57">also a man and right every every single</text>
  <text start="719.23" dur="5.28">body is different so I might I mean I</text>
  <text start="722.29" dur="3.93">can thrive on less calories I can eat</text>
  <text start="724.51" dur="3.78">under 2,000 calories a day and actually</text>
  <text start="726.22" dur="3.84">feel great not a lot of people can do</text>
  <text start="728.29" dur="3.18">that some people need 3 to 4,000</text>
  <text start="730.06" dur="3.96">calories a day just to feel normal so</text>
  <text start="731.47" dur="6.69">again we&amp;#39;re all different and then this</text>
  <text start="734.02" dur="5.37">concept metabolic typing that also goes</text>
  <text start="738.16" dur="2.4">along the lines with biochemical</text>
  <text start="739.39" dur="3.03">individuality and that we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="740.56" dur="3.36">different but metabolic typing</text>
  <text start="742.42" dur="4.53">essentially means that we all have</text>
  <text start="743.92" dur="7.2">different ancestries and heritage so our</text>
  <text start="746.95" dur="7.97">genes have formed based off what our</text>
  <text start="751.12" dur="7.88">ancestors were eating and living like so</text>
  <text start="754.92" dur="6.85">me for instance I am quite a bit of</text>
  <text start="759" dur="5.65">Scandinavian so my ancestors grew up</text>
  <text start="761.77" dur="6.42">with a Scandinavian diet for many many</text>
  <text start="764.65" dur="6.42">centuries that is a high fat a lot of</text>
  <text start="768.19" dur="4.5">cruciferous stuff that grows and you</text>
  <text start="771.07" dur="3.69">know cruciferous veggies that or</text>
  <text start="772.69" dur="3.69">whatever grows in the ground and colder</text>
  <text start="774.76" dur="4.17">climates a lot of fish high fat high</text>
  <text start="776.38" dur="8.67">protein I feel better when I eat that</text>
  <text start="778.93" dur="8.43">way that&amp;#39;s just me so I like higher</text>
  <text start="785.05" dur="8.81">protein higher fat foods that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="787.36" dur="6.5">sustains me I like eating cruciferous</text>
  <text start="798.08" dur="5.069">and this again these concepts mean every</text>
  <text start="801.23" dur="3.6">single person is different I think a lot</text>
  <text start="803.149" dur="3.271">of people get way too caught up in their</text>
  <text start="804.83" dur="3.72">heads when it comes to diets and they</text>
  <text start="806.42" dur="3.21">get attached to all these fads and</text>
  <text start="808.55" dur="2.67">they&amp;#39;re like oh this one didn&amp;#39;t work for</text>
  <text start="809.63" dur="2.76">me this one didn&amp;#39;t work for me well</text>
  <text start="811.22" dur="4.799">that&amp;#39;s because we all need different</text>
  <text start="812.39" dur="5.4">freakin diets so keep those ideas in</text>
  <text start="816.019" dur="3.421">mind again I can do a much more in-depth</text>
  <text start="817.79" dur="3.6">video on this and then I also wrote down</text>
  <text start="819.44" dur="3.51">this little hashtag right here because I</text>
  <text start="821.39" dur="4.17">mean when you boil it down when you just</text>
  <text start="822.95" dur="6.6">keep it freakin a simple when it comes</text>
  <text start="825.56" dur="6.33">to eating just jerk just eat real food</text>
  <text start="829.55" dur="5.43">jerk that&amp;#39;s it make sure what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="831.89" dur="4.92">consuming is as organic non-gmo as</text>

  <text start="840.89" dur="4.28">your food how you cook your food what</text>
  <text start="842.329" dur="6.211">kind of preservatives might be in it and</text>
  <text start="845.17" dur="4.3">just think of the life force that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="848.54" dur="2.97">sustaining you live because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="849.47" dur="4.02">really why we eat food we eat food to</text>
  <text start="851.51" dur="4.23">obtain the lifeforce energy from it so</text>
  <text start="853.49" dur="5.969">the fresher food it is the more organic</text>
  <text start="855.74" dur="5.159">it is the higher quality it is the more</text>

  <text start="883.72" dur="7.119">dude when I health coach people this is</text>
  <text start="888.62" dur="3.839">the one this is the pillar that like it</text>
  <text start="890.839" dur="3.271">doesn&amp;#39;t bug me the most it&amp;#39;s the one</text>
  <text start="892.459" dur="3.361">that I have to bug them the most about</text>
  <text start="894.11" dur="2.969">sometimes in a health club health coach</text>
  <text start="895.82" dur="2.639">people I tell them that I&amp;#39;m literally</text>

  <text start="909.529" dur="4.711">freakin doing it and that&amp;#39;s just drink</text>
  <text start="911.12" dur="4.56">enough water and the cardinal rule that</text>
  <text start="914.24" dur="3.12">you should be hitting is take your body</text>
  <text start="915.68" dur="3.45">weight in pounds divided by two and</text>
  <text start="917.36" dur="5.13">that&amp;#39;s how many ounces usually hit a day</text>
  <text start="919.13" dur="5.04">pretty easy I weigh 170 pounds so I</text>
  <text start="922.49" dur="4.11">usually try to hit between 80 to 90</text>
  <text start="924.17" dur="4.289">ounces of water a day maybe a 110 if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="926.6" dur="4.17">working out or it&amp;#39;s hot out or something</text>
  <text start="928.459" dur="3.271">like that but pretty freakin simple and</text>
  <text start="930.77" dur="5.1">I Gare</text>
  <text start="931.73" dur="7.32">tu 97.3 four percent of people watching</text>
  <text start="935.87" dur="5.579">this video don&amp;#39;t drink enough water per</text>
  <text start="939.05" dur="4.68">day and that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re chronically</text>
  <text start="941.449" dur="5.82">tired when a lot of people are really</text>
  <text start="943.73" dur="5.46">freaking tired and dehydrated they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="947.269" dur="3.93">reach for like coffees and energy drinks</text>
  <text start="949.19" dur="4.019">and things like that that are diuretics</text>
  <text start="951.199" dur="3.45">with dehydrate them even more and then</text>
  <text start="953.209" dur="3.361">it&amp;#39;s just again this perpetual cycle</text>
  <text start="954.649" dur="4.321">people get themselves into if they would</text>
  <text start="956.57" dur="3.269">simply wake up drink enough water and</text>
  <text start="958.97" dur="2.489">make sure they drink enough water</text>
  <text start="959.839" dur="4.05">throughout the day we wouldn&amp;#39;t need</text>

  <text start="963.889" dur="5.88">completely stimulating us and making us</text>
  <text start="966.649" dur="5.611">all wide-eyed and I also wrote down here</text>
  <text start="969.769" dur="5.25">water energetics which is just a very</text>
  <text start="972.26" dur="4.47">very interesting to me in that you can</text>
  <text start="975.019" dur="4.801">actually energize your water through</text>

  <text start="984.769" dur="4.741">different products like dissolved oxygen</text>
  <text start="987.05" dur="4.38">drops or willard&amp;#39;s water or anything</text>
  <text start="989.51" dur="3.78">like that you can actually play around</text>
  <text start="991.43" dur="3.779">with your water or you can just simply</text>
  <text start="993.29" dur="5.51">just add electrolytes to it or like</text>
  <text start="995.209" dur="6.031">Emily in pink salt to make it better but</text>
  <text start="998.8" dur="5.229">lots of stuff you can do to hydrate</text>
  <text start="1001.24" dur="4.649">yourself much better but again stay away</text>
  <text start="1004.029" dur="4.231">from the pointless thing stay away from</text>

  <text start="1019.089" dur="4.081">stay away from the soda pops and all</text>
  <text start="1020.86" dur="5.37">just pointless stuff like that so drink</text>
  <text start="1023.17" dur="5.639">right eat right and sleep right sleep</text>
  <text start="1026.23" dur="4.38">right really basic eight hours a night</text>
  <text start="1028.809" dur="3.481">make sure you don&amp;#39;t have a bunch of</text>

  <text start="1034.439" dur="5.441">also I wrote this one down but this kind</text>
  <text start="1038.02" dur="5.039">of goes along the lines of rhythm rhythm</text>
  <text start="1039.88" dur="4.709">slash sleep move with the seasons this</text>
  <text start="1043.059" dur="5.101">is a big one I think a lot of people</text>

  <text start="1048.16" dur="2.97">don&amp;#39;t have that long-term thinking</text>
  <text start="1049.6" dur="5.04">capabilities but it&amp;#39;s very important to</text>
  <text start="1051.13" dur="5.58">do in that you have to move with rhythm</text>
  <text start="1054.64" dur="4.169">in your life so what I mean by that is</text>
  <text start="1056.71" dur="3.81">if you have like three to four months</text>
  <text start="1058.809" dur="3.541">say during the summer where you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="1060.52" dur="3.659">pounding out a bunch of work and you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1073.81" dur="6.99">feminine within you and relax it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1077.56" dur="5.67">interesting in our society how men who</text>
  <text start="1080.8" dur="4.14">relax say you go get a massage you lay</text>
  <text start="1083.23" dur="4.98">in a hammock or you do anything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1084.94" dur="6.15">relaxing that&amp;#39;s feminine oriented it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1088.21" dur="5.79">often looked down upon right it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1091.09" dur="5.55">we have this completely skewed version</text>
  <text start="1094" dur="3.81">of what is really masculine and what is</text>
  <text start="1096.64" dur="2.64">really feminine and how we should</text>
  <text start="1097.81" dur="3.84">balance the two in our heads it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1099.28" dur="5.91">totally screwed up and this delves into</text>
  <text start="1101.65" dur="5.31">the whole debate and idea and in tangent</text>
  <text start="1105.19" dur="3.72">of oh the rise of the divine feminine</text>
  <text start="1106.96" dur="4.44">and the divine masculine and balancing</text>
  <text start="1108.91" dur="5.88">the two and yada yada but I kind of gave</text>
  <text start="1111.4" dur="6.24">you a few tidbits into that discussion</text>
  <text start="1114.79" dur="4.82">here but it&amp;#39;s very important it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1117.64" dur="4.32">important to honor both the masculine</text>
  <text start="1119.61" dur="5.59">catabolic breakdown side of us and the</text>
  <text start="1121.96" dur="6.63">feminine anabolic regrowth side of us or</text>
  <text start="1125.2" dur="5.07">the sympathetic nervous system and</text>
