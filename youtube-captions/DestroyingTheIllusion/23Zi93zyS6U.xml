  <text start="103.13" dur="4.779">bidness today first thing I want to talk</text>
  <text start="106.079" dur="5.191">about is to the stars</text>
  <text start="107.909" dur="5.64">Tom DeLong&amp;#39;s to the stars initiative and</text>
  <text start="111.27" dur="4.139">you&amp;#39;re familiar with this I&amp;#39;m sure you</text>
  <text start="113.549" dur="4.53">are you remember at the end of last year</text>
  <text start="115.409" dur="5.28">in December when the New York Times ran</text>
  <text start="118.079" dur="5.07">their articles about the Pentagon&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="120.689" dur="7.651">mysterious UFO program and all of that</text>
  <text start="123.149" dur="5.761">so new news about to the Stars just the</text>
  <text start="128.34" dur="3.21">other day</text>
  <text start="128.91" dur="4.26">Jimmy Church on his fade to black radio</text>
  <text start="131.55" dur="2.31">show if you&amp;#39;re not familiar with Jimmy</text>
  <text start="133.17" dur="3.03">Church and</text>
  <text start="133.86" dur="4.14">two black radio go check it out it is</text>
  <text start="136.2" dur="3.57">awesome he has great guests on every</text>
  <text start="138" dur="4.68">single week he&amp;#39;s got a voice that just</text>
  <text start="139.77" dur="4.29">soothes the soul I really love listening</text>
  <text start="142.68" dur="4.56">to his radio program one of the only</text>
  <text start="144.06" dur="5.82">ones that I can set some time aside and</text>
  <text start="147.24" dur="5.04">actually stand and enjoy listening to so</text>
  <text start="149.88" dur="5.73">on his radio show the other day</text>
  <text start="152.28" dur="6.63">Jimmy Church broke some news about to</text>
  <text start="155.61" dur="5.73">the stars financial statement they filed</text>
  <text start="158.91" dur="4.71">with the SEC recently so to the stars</text>
  <text start="161.34" dur="4.98">put out a financial statement and in</text>
  <text start="163.62" dur="6.06">this financial statement there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="166.32" dur="5.91">of questions that Jimmy was asking about</text>
  <text start="169.68" dur="6.45">this financial statement but one note in</text>
  <text start="172.23" dur="8.84">particular on it was the fact that to</text>
  <text start="176.13" dur="7.5">the stars is 37 million dollars in debt</text>
  <text start="181.07" dur="5.08">now on this financial statement it also</text>
  <text start="183.63" dur="5.64">said that somehow this company was still</text>
  <text start="186.15" dur="6.78">able to release a book Tom DeLonge has</text>
  <text start="189.27" dur="5.79">got a brand new book out they have a</text>
  <text start="192.93" dur="3.96">website multiple websites and they were</text>
  <text start="195.06" dur="5.55">still able to conduct business</text>
  <text start="196.89" dur="5.79">activities which includes meeting with</text>
  <text start="200.61" dur="7.98">government officials still and all this</text>
  <text start="202.68" dur="8.49">other stuff so the question is how are</text>
  <text start="208.59" dur="5.6">they going about all of these business</text>
  <text start="211.17" dur="5.37">activities while losing so much money</text>
  <text start="214.19" dur="4.18">how are they able to stay in business</text>
  <text start="216.54" dur="4.729">and do all of this in this financial</text>
  <text start="218.37" dur="5.88">statement it actually said in there that</text>
  <text start="221.269" dur="5.141">there is question if to the Stars is</text>
  <text start="224.25" dur="5.37">going to be able to continue as a</text>
  <text start="226.41" dur="5.73">business but yet they still are they</text>
  <text start="229.62" dur="5.22">still are doing all this stuff with not</text>
  <text start="232.14" dur="5.43">that much money actually so the question</text>
  <text start="234.84" dur="5.22">is who is funding them how are they able</text>
  <text start="237.57" dur="6.21">to continue doing all this stuff with no</text>
  <text start="240.06" dur="6.57">money are they getting funding from the</text>
  <text start="243.78" dur="6.39">government somehow maybe some</text>
  <text start="246.63" dur="4.77">three-letter agency which one maybe</text>
  <text start="250.17" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;re getting some sort of</text>
  <text start="251.4" dur="5.24">back-channel funding from a private</text>
  <text start="253.32" dur="6.659">corporation some aerospace company maybe</text>
  <text start="256.64" dur="5.2">which one so there&amp;#39;s a lot of questions</text>
  <text start="259.979" dur="3.181">that arise there&amp;#39;s a lot of things of</text>
  <text start="261.84" dur="3.06">course we can speculate on but</text>
  <text start="263.16" dur="3.48">regardless there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot of</text>
  <text start="264.9" dur="2.79">eyes digging into this financial</text>
  <text start="266.64" dur="3.57">statement and</text>
  <text start="267.69" dur="4.23">looking at to the Stars business</text>
  <text start="270.21" dur="4.83">activities and not only that but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="271.92" dur="5.49">very curious as to what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="275.04" dur="5.19">continue rolling out what information</text>
  <text start="277.41" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re gonna roll out and also what</text>
  <text start="280.23" dur="4.11">narrative what agenda that&amp;#39;s gonna fit</text>
  <text start="282.6" dur="5.21">into because of course there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="284.34" dur="6.47">very questionable individuals that is</text>
  <text start="287.81" dur="6.13">tied to this whole to the Stars</text>
  <text start="290.81" dur="4.96">campaigns so a very interesting thing I</text>
  <text start="293.94" dur="4.47">just want to make a note of that so you</text>
  <text start="295.77" dur="5.13">guys were aware now let&amp;#39;s also talk</text>
  <text start="298.41" dur="4.92">about NASA a lot of this is gonna be</text>
  <text start="300.9" dur="5.45">about space so shifting over to NASA</text>
  <text start="303.33" dur="7.59">today speaking of anniversaries is</text>
  <text start="306.35" dur="6.52">NASA&amp;#39;s 60th anniversary now there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="310.92" dur="3.9">much I have to say information wise on</text>
  <text start="312.87" dur="6.48">that but I just want to make a couple</text>
  <text start="314.82" dur="6.42">notes on NASA and one of those notes is</text>
  <text start="319.35" dur="4.14">of course NASA&amp;#39;s a smokescreen that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="321.24" dur="7.05">probably not new information to you the</text>
  <text start="323.49" dur="8.28">fact that NASA is the public front to</text>
  <text start="328.29" dur="6">hide and conceal secret space programs</text>
  <text start="331.77" dur="5.04">and secretive technologies and all sorts</text>
  <text start="334.29" dur="4.5">of stuff so yes NASA&amp;#39;s a smokescreen but</text>
  <text start="336.81" dur="3.33">the point I want to make here and the</text>
  <text start="338.79" dur="4.62">reason I&amp;#39;m making this point is because</text>
  <text start="340.14" dur="5.67">I&amp;#39;m just seeing so many people kind of</text>
  <text start="343.41" dur="5.37">throw the logic out when thinking about</text>
  <text start="345.81" dur="5.04">NASA recently and that&amp;#39;s the fact that</text>
  <text start="348.78" dur="4.74">just because NASA is a smokescreen and</text>
  <text start="350.85" dur="4.62">maybe some of the information they put</text>
  <text start="353.52" dur="4.41">out might be skewed in some particular</text>
  <text start="355.47" dur="6.27">way that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that everything</text>
  <text start="357.93" dur="5.58">nASA has ever put out is bad information</text>
  <text start="361.74" dur="3.45">and bad data don&amp;#39;t throw the baby out</text>
  <text start="363.51" dur="4.02">with the bathwater is what I&amp;#39;m trying to</text>
  <text start="365.19" dur="3.9">say it&amp;#39;s faulty logic to assume just</text>
  <text start="367.53" dur="5.49">because they might have said one thing</text>
  <text start="369.09" dur="7.05">that&amp;#39;s untrue or skewed means all of it</text>
  <text start="373.02" dur="4.41">is untrue okay NASA puts out a lot of</text>
  <text start="376.14" dur="3.18">good data</text>
  <text start="377.43" dur="4.71">the thing is they just don&amp;#39;t put that</text>
  <text start="379.32" dur="4.41">data into context for us and some of</text>
  <text start="382.14" dur="4.14">that data of course muddies the waters a</text>
  <text start="383.73" dur="5.31">little bit so be very discerning and</text>
  <text start="386.28" dur="5.1">careful with what information you decide</text>
  <text start="389.04" dur="6.54">to throw out when you figure out that</text>
  <text start="391.38" dur="9.23">one organization or one person might be</text>
  <text start="395.58" dur="8.72">a misinformation asset right Oh</text>
  <text start="400.61" dur="5.97">okay next let&amp;#39;s talk about this strange</text>
  <text start="404.3" dur="4.95">particles coming out of the earth hint</text>
  <text start="406.58" dur="4.829">at new physics this is an article going</text>
  <text start="409.25" dur="3.99">around in the Scientific American and</text>
  <text start="411.409" dur="4.141">Popular Mechanics all the mainstream</text>
  <text start="413.24" dur="4.62">science articles and what it&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="415.55" dur="4.709">about is that a neutrino Observatory in</text>
  <text start="417.86" dur="4.41">Antarctica spotted some particles that</text>
  <text start="420.259" dur="4.291">shouldn&amp;#39;t exist suggesting a new</text>
  <text start="422.27" dur="4.859">discovery awaits and this article goes</text>
  <text start="424.55" dur="5.31">to mention how these neutrinos shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="427.129" dur="5.76">be being detected in Antarctica but</text>
  <text start="429.86" dur="5.489">somehow they are so it&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="432.889" dur="6.27">all these new ideas of theoretical</text>
  <text start="435.349" dur="8.07">physics new physics yada yada yada but</text>
  <text start="439.159" dur="6.57">here&amp;#39;s the thing so great new physics</text>
  <text start="443.419" dur="5.671">kind of a soft disclosure there we</text>
  <text start="445.729" dur="6.12">absolutely need a redo in all of our</text>
  <text start="449.09" dur="5.849">theoretical models of physics right but</text>
  <text start="451.849" dur="6.84">what these science articles are trying</text>
  <text start="454.939" dur="5.76">to do is say that okay a new version of</text>
  <text start="458.689" dur="7.35">physics is on the way but they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="460.699" dur="7.201">to mesh that with the false nonsensical</text>
  <text start="466.039" dur="4.861">theories that we already have they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="467.9" dur="5.91">still stuck in materialistic particle</text>
  <text start="470.9" dur="4.65">physics right materialistic physics</text>
  <text start="473.81" dur="4.19">they&amp;#39;re not thinking of energetic</text>
  <text start="475.55" dur="5.359">phenomena they&amp;#39;re not thinking of</text>
  <text start="478" dur="6.58">vibration or anything outside of</text>
  <text start="480.909" dur="5.26">materialism outside of particle ISM we</text>
  <text start="484.58" dur="4.949">could call it so like I said they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="486.169" dur="5.941">trying to mesh new ideas with their old</text>
  <text start="489.529" dur="5.67">bunk ideas and that&amp;#39;s not gonna happen</text>
  <text start="492.11" dur="4.89">what we have to do is wipe the slate</text>
  <text start="495.199" dur="4.321">clean white the wipe the whiteboard</text>
  <text start="497" dur="4.56">clean and start building back the</text>
  <text start="499.52" dur="4.38">foundations of our knowledge the</text>
  <text start="501.56" dur="4.5">foundations of our theories and then go</text>
  <text start="503.9" dur="4.41">from there okay a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="506.06" dur="3.629">still stuck on Einstein thinking he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="508.31" dur="4.169">the biggest genius in the world they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="509.689" dur="5.241">still stuck on certain standard model</text>
  <text start="512.479" dur="4.531">theories and that&amp;#39;s totally</text>
  <text start="514.93" dur="4.45">misconstruing things in their heads so</text>
  <text start="517.01" dur="4.55">I&amp;#39;m gonna keep my eye on this and I</text>
  <text start="519.38" dur="5.49">think we&amp;#39;re gonna see more of this more</text>
  <text start="521.56" dur="5.32">true physics disclosed but disclosed in</text>
  <text start="524.87" dur="5.219">certain ways that makes it look like</text>
  <text start="526.88" dur="5.3">they haven&amp;#39;t been lying to us for 6070</text>
  <text start="530.089" dur="4.211">years about certain physics theories</text>
  <text start="532.18" dur="4.61">that&amp;#39;s interesting they&amp;#39;re okay</text>
  <text start="534.3" dur="5.43">so now let&amp;#39;s get into new indictment</text>
  <text start="536.79" dur="5.19">count so DA Martin 32 on Twitter storm</text>
  <text start="539.73" dur="3.539">watcher and his crew they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="541.98" dur="2.64">that have been following all of these</text>
  <text start="543.269" dur="3">sealed indictments and counting them up</text>
  <text start="544.62" dur="3.77">every month they have a new count</text>
  <text start="546.269" dur="5.431">there&amp;#39;s been about forty five hundred</text>
  <text start="548.39" dur="4.74">new entries in pacer systems around the</text>
  <text start="551.7" dur="4.079">country in the month of September</text>
  <text start="553.13" dur="4.87">bringing the total sealed court record</text>
  <text start="555.779" dur="4.021">count up to this number here fifty five</text>
  <text start="558" dur="5.399">thousand six hundred and seventy seven</text>
  <text start="559.8" dur="6.36">all entered should be a nine they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="563.399" dur="7.021">entered in eleven months averaging about</text>
  <text start="566.16" dur="6.81">five thousand per month so still raising</text>
  <text start="570.42" dur="4.979">still raising about 4,500 to 5,000 a</text>
  <text start="572.97" dur="5.64">month those investigators working with</text>
  <text start="575.399" dur="6">John Huber still doing work and I am</text>
  <text start="578.61" dur="5.58">seeing a lot of disinformation bring</text>
  <text start="581.399" dur="4.651">spread lately about these sealed</text>
  <text start="584.19" dur="5.399">indictments I&amp;#39;ve seen some people call</text>
  <text start="586.05" dur="5.279">them bankruptcies as if bankruptcies are</text>
  <text start="589.589" dur="3.99">criminal bankruptcies aren&amp;#39;t criminal</text>
  <text start="591.329" dur="4.021">they wouldn&amp;#39;t be filed in the piece or</text>
  <text start="593.579" dur="3.45">court records not only that but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="595.35" dur="3.87">seeing just some bad misinformation out</text>
  <text start="597.029" dur="5.461">there about all these indictments are</text>
  <text start="599.22" dur="5.369">nothing new it&amp;#39;s all normal it&amp;#39;s not out</text>
  <text start="602.49" dur="5.039">of the ordinary etc etc I mean just</text>
  <text start="604.589" dur="4.591">connect the dots guys yes these</text>
  <text start="607.529" dur="4.081">indictments are totally out of the</text>
  <text start="609.18" dur="4.59">ordinary much more than a normal year</text>
  <text start="611.61" dur="3.66">not only that but if you look at the</text>
  <text start="613.77" dur="4.62">areas of the country that these are</text>
  <text start="615.27" dur="4.98">filed it&amp;#39;s all cabal hotspots California</text>
  <text start="618.39" dur="3.54">look at the port cities on the west</text>
  <text start="620.25" dur="4.92">coast in the East Coast the Northeast</text>
  <text start="621.93" dur="7.77">the border states Texas Arizona right</text>
  <text start="625.17" dur="7.05">and combine that with the coincidence</text>
  <text start="629.7" dur="5.25">that all of these indictments started</text>
  <text start="632.22" dur="5.67">getting filed right when John Huber and</text>
  <text start="634.95" dur="5.07">his team of 417 investigators were</text>
