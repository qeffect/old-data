  <text start="9.679" dur="5.62">hey guys it is March 31st here and I</text>
  <text start="12.78" dur="6.409">wanted to do a quick video discussing a</text>
  <text start="15.299" dur="5.64">concept called truth in plain sight and</text>
  <text start="19.189" dur="2.891">hopefully throw some ideas and</text>
  <text start="20.939" dur="3.541">perspectives out there to help you</text>
  <text start="22.08" dur="4.47">understand this topic a bit more and the</text>
  <text start="24.48" dur="4.35">deeper implications of it and the truth</text>
  <text start="26.55" dur="5.91">in plain sight is basically just that</text>
  <text start="28.83" dur="6.749">it&amp;#39;s the idea that our global elites or</text>
  <text start="32.46" dur="5.55">the Cabal are putting basically all of</text>
  <text start="35.579" dur="4.98">their plans right out there in the open</text>
  <text start="38.01" dur="5.19">for all of us to see but of course the</text>
  <text start="40.559" dur="4.891">majority of population in their hypnotic</text>
  <text start="43.2" dur="5.129">trance state don&amp;#39;t even see the plans</text>
  <text start="45.45" dur="5.19">right in front of them and the best way</text>
  <text start="48.329" dur="5.401">to describe this concept is to simply</text>
  <text start="50.64" dur="4.59">name examples and there&amp;#39;s I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="53.73" dur="4.829">difficult to name examples because</text>
  <text start="55.23" dur="5.489">there&amp;#39;s so many of them and for instance</text>
  <text start="58.559" dur="4.561">pick pretty much any movie you want</text>
  <text start="60.719" dur="4.321">there&amp;#39;s gonna be some right there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="63.12" dur="3.569">many movie productions Hollywood</text>
  <text start="65.04" dur="3.899">productions where the elites put their</text>
  <text start="66.689" dur="5.22">plans right out there in plain sight one</text>
  <text start="68.939" dur="4.86">of my favorite franchises is the Bourne</text>
  <text start="71.909" dur="4.621">movies in the Bourne movies literally</text>
  <text start="73.799" dur="6.411">deal with black CIA projects of mind</text>
  <text start="76.53" dur="6.42">control and CIA assassins right there</text>
  <text start="80.21" dur="6.37">the movie The Matrix is a fantastic one</text>
  <text start="82.95" dur="5.669">that a lot of people use an example</text>
  <text start="86.58" dur="3.99">because in the matrix its basically</text>
  <text start="88.619" dur="3.54">describing exactly what&amp;#39;s going on in</text>
  <text start="90.57" dur="3.2">human society a lot of people walking</text>
  <text start="92.159" dur="3.871">around in a trance State not even</text>
  <text start="93.77" dur="3.73">awakened you know they&amp;#39;re all still</text>
  <text start="96.03" dur="3.21">stuck in that matrix they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="97.5" dur="3.659">wakened out of it neo is one of the ones</text>
  <text start="99.24" dur="3.03">that awakens and tries to fight it yadda</text>
  <text start="101.159" dur="3.931">yadda</text>
  <text start="102.27" dur="5.129">the an example could be the back of the</text>
  <text start="105.09" dur="5.25">one dollar bill boom we have the pyramid</text>
  <text start="107.399" dur="5.04">the all-seeing eye and New World Order</text>
  <text start="110.34" dur="3.69">in Latin right around it so I mean I</text>
  <text start="112.439" dur="3.93">could keep going on with examples but</text>
  <text start="114.03" dur="6.83">you catch my drift and really the exact</text>
  <text start="116.369" dur="6.6">the what inspired me to do this video is</text>
  <text start="120.86" dur="4.06">this article right here I just came</text>
  <text start="122.969" dur="6.63">across again the other day and that was</text>
  <text start="124.92" dur="6.6">a news news article put out by The</text>
  <text start="129.599" dur="4.111">Huffington Post in 2012 discussing the</text>
  <text start="131.52" dur="5.22">secret space program so again their use</text>
  <text start="133.71" dur="7.38">the news to put their plans out in plain</text>
  <text start="136.74" dur="6">sight for all of us to see and I want to</text>
  <text start="141.09" dur="2.64">tell you the reasons why that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="142.74" dur="3.39">doing this video because I want to</text>
  <text start="143.73" dur="3.42">discuss why exactly they do it because a</text>
  <text start="146.13" dur="2.91">lot of people still don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="147.15" dur="4.28">understand the concepts behind putting</text>
  <text start="149.04" dur="6.27">all the ideas in plain sight like this</text>
  <text start="151.43" dur="6.37">firstly is the basic reason you could</text>
  <text start="155.31" dur="5.73">say and the basic reason is basically it</text>
  <text start="157.8" dur="5.91">normalizes us and desensitizes us to the</text>
  <text start="161.04" dur="3.99">concepts right this is a picture I just</text>
  <text start="163.71" dur="5.04">found this morning actually before I was</text>
  <text start="165.03" dur="6.03">going to do this video of kids movies</text>
  <text start="168.75" dur="4.73">various kids movies with chemtrails in</text>
  <text start="171.06" dur="4.92">the background you see when kids grow up</text>
  <text start="173.48" dur="4.45">and they&amp;#39;re conscious mind is being</text>
  <text start="175.98" dur="3.48">framed by everything they&amp;#39;re watching if</text>
  <text start="177.93" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re gonna watch a bunch of things</text>
  <text start="179.46" dur="3.81">with chemtrails in the background it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="181.71" dur="3.12">going to basically prep their mind and</text>
  <text start="183.27" dur="3.87">normalize it to them and make them think</text>
  <text start="184.83" dur="4.08">that it&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s just the way things are</text>
  <text start="187.14" dur="4.05">when it&amp;#39;s really not supposed to be that</text>
  <text start="188.91" dur="4.08">way so putting the truth in plain sight</text>
  <text start="191.19" dur="4.95">basically preps people&amp;#39;s subconscious</text>
  <text start="192.99" dur="4.77">mind to believe these ideas to be the</text>
  <text start="196.14" dur="2.91">normal and the way that things should be</text>
  <text start="197.76" dur="2.55">because that&amp;#39;s exactly what the powers</text>
  <text start="199.05" dur="4.71">that they want they want us to believe</text>
  <text start="200.31" dur="4.89">that it&amp;#39;s normal when it&amp;#39;s really not so</text>
  <text start="203.76" dur="4.2">not only does it normalize it it</text>
  <text start="205.2" dur="4.86">desensitizes us to the subjects right if</text>
  <text start="207.96" dur="4.05">you&amp;#39;re gonna watch a movie called</text>
  <text start="210.06" dur="3.81">Independence Day about a secret space</text>
  <text start="212.01" dur="3.83">program an alien crash and stuff like</text>
  <text start="213.87" dur="5.25">that</text>
  <text start="215.84" dur="5.83">disguising the truth as fiction will</text>
  <text start="219.12" dur="5.94">desensitize us to it and not make people</text>
  <text start="221.67" dur="5.97">take those subjects seriously and again</text>
  <text start="225.06" dur="4.53">I mean they&amp;#39;ll hide it with fiction but</text>
  <text start="227.64" dur="4.53">if people try to bring up these concepts</text>
  <text start="229.59" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;ll laugh it off and say oh you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="232.17" dur="3.96">got that idea from this movie or ah ha</text>
  <text start="234.12" dur="3.75">ha you&amp;#39;re you know you&amp;#39;re crazy for</text>
  <text start="236.13" dur="3.99">believing something that&amp;#39;s fiction could</text>
  <text start="237.87" dur="4.59">be real see you see there&amp;#39;s a couple</text>
  <text start="240.12" dur="4.43">really basic it&amp;#39;s just psychological</text>
  <text start="242.46" dur="4.89">manipulation right it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="244.55" dur="4.75">psychological warfare is what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="247.35" dur="3.93">right now and those are just some really</text>
  <text start="249.3" dur="6">basic reasons why they do it</text>
  <text start="251.28" dur="6.72">so normalizes it desensitizes disguises</text>
  <text start="255.3" dur="4.41">the truth is fiction and there&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="258" dur="5.34">reason that I wanted to pass along to</text>
  <text start="259.71" dur="5.1">you and this is a much deeper reasoning</text>
  <text start="263.34" dur="3.42">as to why they put the truth in plain</text>
  <text start="264.81" dur="4.74">sight but it&amp;#39;s very important to</text>
  <text start="266.76" dur="4.35">and for these times these specific times</text>
  <text start="269.55" dur="3.42">right now it&amp;#39;s very important for the</text>
  <text start="271.11" dur="3.33">whole anybody undergoing an awakening</text>
  <text start="272.97" dur="4.71">process to understand and that is</text>
  <text start="274.44" dur="5.22">freewill so understanding why they put</text>
  <text start="277.68" dur="3.84">the truth in plain sight requires an</text>
  <text start="279.66" dur="4.53">understanding of the natural laws of the</text>
  <text start="281.52" dur="4.38">universe and a very basic summarization</text>
  <text start="284.19" dur="5.16">that I can do real quicker for you is</text>
  <text start="285.9" dur="6.9">that free will is the highest of all the</text>
  <text start="289.35" dur="6.9">natural laws and what this encompasses</text>
  <text start="292.8" dur="5.46">is that when two beings basically enter</text>
  <text start="296.25" dur="4.98">into an agreement with each other that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="298.26" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s a contract that&amp;#39;s a consensual</text>
  <text start="301.23" dur="3.93">contract between the two and there must</text>
  <text start="303.33" dur="4.44">be full transparency and full openness</text>
  <text start="305.16" dur="7.49">between all of the parties involved in</text>
  <text start="307.77" dur="7.23">any type of contract for an honorable</text>
  <text start="312.65" dur="4.6">contract to take place if you kind of</text>
  <text start="315" dur="3.54">catch my drift it&amp;#39;s very complex and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="317.25" dur="5.64">like trying to discuss it in a couple</text>
  <text start="318.54" dur="7.44">sentences here but basically there has</text>
  <text start="322.89" dur="4.77">to be all beings in a consensual</text>
  <text start="325.98" dur="4.98">agreement must be fully notified of</text>
  <text start="327.66" dur="5.01">what&amp;#39;s going on by the elites putting</text>
  <text start="330.96" dur="4.56">the truth in plain sight that is</text>
  <text start="332.67" dur="8.1">essentially their way of notifying the</text>
  <text start="335.52" dur="8.4">public of their plans and in their minds</text>
  <text start="340.77" dur="7.5">they literally believe they that oh you</text>
  <text start="343.92" dur="6.24">know we are notifying the globe as to</text>
  <text start="348.27" dur="4.2">our plans but there&amp;#39;s you know they</text>
  <text start="350.16" dur="6">don&amp;#39;t even get it they don&amp;#39;t even see it</text>
  <text start="352.47" dur="6.99">so that then allows us you know that</text>
  <text start="356.16" dur="4.47">then allows us to push our agenda upon</text>
  <text start="359.46" dur="3.12">them without spinning that wheel of</text>
  <text start="360.63" dur="3.72">karma without infringing upon their free</text>
  <text start="362.58" dur="4.62">will do you see so if they tell us their</text>
  <text start="364.35" dur="4.53">plans we are to dumb down and too</text>
  <text start="367.2" dur="3.75">ignorant to see it but they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="368.88" dur="5.93">us then they don&amp;#39;t enact that wheel of</text>
  <text start="370.95" dur="6.84">karma and infringe upon our freewill and</text>
  <text start="374.81" dur="5.92">basically what is occurring this fall is</text>
  <text start="377.79" dur="5.55">along the lines of tacit consent so this</text>
  <text start="380.73" dur="5.07">means silence is consent our silence is</text>
  <text start="383.34" dur="4.62">basically Arendt&amp;#39;s our consent to be</text>
  <text start="385.8" dur="5.13">screwed do you see it&amp;#39;s our</text>
  <text start="387.96" dur="7.65">responsibility to stop being silent and</text>
  <text start="390.93" dur="7.41">start unconsenting to their plans that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="395.61" dur="4.89">what breaks the contract that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="398.34" dur="4.11">starts spinning that we love</text>
  <text start="400.5" dur="3.36">right we have to literally take our</text>
  <text start="402.45" dur="4.83">freewill back we have to spin that wheel</text>
  <text start="403.86" dur="6.03">of karma by did unconsenting dis</text>
  <text start="407.28" dur="6.33">consenting from that system from their</text>
  <text start="409.89" dur="5.07">plans so this is why I mean this is why</text>
  <text start="413.61" dur="2.88">I wanted to do this video because you</text>
  <text start="414.96" dur="4.53">need to understand that it&amp;#39;s our</text>
  <text start="416.49" dur="4.35">responsibility yes they&amp;#39;re the Cabal are</text>
  <text start="419.49" dur="4.05">a bunch of evil dickheads</text>
  <text start="420.84" dur="4.77">but it&amp;#39;s up to us to take our</text>
  <text start="423.54" dur="4.5">responsibility back by dis consenting</text>
  <text start="425.61" dur="7.47">that&amp;#39;s exactly what starts spinning that</text>
  <text start="428.04" dur="9.06">wheel of karma and basically gets the</text>
  <text start="433.08" dur="5.31">playing game back in our favor so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="437.1" dur="3.6">what you need to understand about the</text>
  <text start="438.39" dur="4.38">truth in plain sight they do it for a</text>
  <text start="440.7" dur="4.92">couple basic reasons to normalize it to</text>
  <text start="442.77" dur="5.34">you know psychological manipulation but</text>
  <text start="445.62" dur="4.62">on a deeper spiritual level it all has</text>
  <text start="448.11" dur="5.58">to do with freewill and it&amp;#39;s up to us</text>
  <text start="450.24" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s our responsibility we have let them</text>
  <text start="453.69" dur="4.44">do it that&amp;#39;s what people need to</text>
  <text start="455.88" dur="4.8">understand it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s been our fault</text>
  <text start="458.13" dur="4.92">because we have let them continue their</text>
  <text start="460.68" dur="3.96">plans by staying silent shutting up and</text>
  <text start="463.05" dur="4.41">not having the courage to speak up about</text>
  <text start="464.64" dur="4.62">it so that&amp;#39;s why I do these videos to</text>
  <text start="467.46" dur="6.81">help people have the courage to speak up</text>
  <text start="469.26" dur="6.78">to put these ideas out there and make</text>
  <text start="474.27" dur="2.82">people take responsibility for</text>
  <text start="476.04" dur="3.57">themselves because that&amp;#39;s the only way</text>
  <text start="477.09" dur="4.079">we&amp;#39;re going to succeed as a human race</text>
  <text start="479.61" dur="4.559">and basically win our freedom is by</text>
  <text start="481.169" dur="4.981">taking the responsibility back for us so</text>
  <text start="484.169" dur="3.451">anyway I can keep ranting and digressing</text>
  <text start="486.15" dur="4.5">but I hope you enjoy that video some</text>
  <text start="487.62" dur="5.46">pretty deep concepts but I invite you to</text>
  <text start="490.65" dur="3.78">look more into the ideas of natural law</text>
  <text start="493.08" dur="3.48">I&amp;#39;ll see what I can find a link down</text>
  <text start="494.43" dur="3.75">below where you can grasp much more</text>
  <text start="496.56" dur="3.9">deeper concepts about who we are as</text>
  <text start="498.18" dur="4.15">spiritual beings and why things are the</text>
  <text start="500.46" dur="16.949">way things are done</text>
