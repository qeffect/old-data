  <text start="132.35" dur="4.47">challenged the narrative our band Shawn</text>
  <text start="134.09" dur="5.54">threatened yeah and I think we all know</text>
  <text start="136.82" dur="4.65">a lot about that Planned Parenthood is</text>
  <text start="139.63" dur="3.639">good yeah it&amp;#39;s always kind of been</text>
  <text start="141.47" dur="4.2">presented as sort of a community service</text>
  <text start="143.269" dur="3.931">right there and if China is not a threat</text>
  <text start="145.67" dur="3.63">narrative we know better than that right</text>

  <text start="149.3" dur="8.909">yeah look um out there in China the</text>
  <text start="154.94" dur="5.03">fetus is used for the placenta is used</text>
  <text start="158.209" dur="3.931">for a lot of different things skin care</text>
  <text start="159.97" dur="3.489">some people feel it&amp;#39;s kind of a fountain</text>
  <text start="162.14" dur="3">and you thing or whatever it&amp;#39;s quite</text>
  <text start="163.459" dur="5.881">disgusting but there&amp;#39;s a market for it</text>
  <text start="165.14" dur="5.61">and you know obviously this topic is a</text>
  <text start="169.34" dur="3.209">tough one to talk about it&amp;#39;s a tough one</text>
  <text start="170.75" dur="3.06">to deal with but it&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="172.549" dur="3.151">not just happening in the US it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="173.81" dur="4.05">happening worldwide it&amp;#39;s an epidemic</text>
  <text start="175.7" dur="4.44">levels particularly in China really</text>
  <text start="177.86" dur="3.51">Southeast Asia in general do you know</text>
  <text start="180.14" dur="1.5">the market price for a fetus I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="181.37" dur="2.99">know</text>
  <text start="181.64" dur="4.95">I bet it&amp;#39;s hot I bet it&amp;#39;s real real hot</text>
  <text start="184.36" dur="4.48">because obviously getting care in</text>
  <text start="186.59" dur="4.05">Southeast Asia and Asia in general is</text>
  <text start="188.84" dur="3.149">super super important and so that&amp;#39;s sort</text>
  <text start="190.64" dur="3.719">of a premium from that and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="191.989" dur="4.171">it&amp;#39;s used for sadly enough correlation</text>
  <text start="194.359" dur="2.701">of market price and days-old of fetus</text>
  <text start="196.16" dur="2.909">baby</text>

  <text start="211.849" dur="2.821">that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re talking about what</text>
  <text start="212.87" dur="3.54">we&amp;#39;re talking about and that&amp;#39;s why it is</text>
  <text start="214.67" dur="3.39">so important that we deal with this</text>
  <text start="216.41" dur="3.6">Planned Parenthood issue so that people</text>
  <text start="218.06" dur="3.6">can really really understand what this</text>
  <text start="220.01" dur="3.24">is all about this is not about a woman&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="221.66" dur="4.77">right to choose this is something so</text>
  <text start="223.25" dur="5.67">much more sinister as age days increases</text>

  <text start="1251.85" dur="3.51">politics are I think they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="1253.08" dur="5.64">going to it&amp;#39;s gonna change a lot as far</text>
  <text start="1255.36" dur="4.8">as campaigning goes at the very least to</text>
  <text start="1258.72" dur="3.42">demonstrate the massive appeal energy</text>
  <text start="1260.16" dur="3.63">and size of this movement plus ability</text>
  <text start="1262.14" dur="4.44">to correct false reporting and or</text>
  <text start="1263.79" dur="4.44">highlight achievements goals etc yeah it</text>
  <text start="1266.58" dur="5.4">seems like you know Trump sort of</text>
  <text start="1268.23" dur="4.74">bloviating on just simply on all the</text>
  <text start="1271.98" dur="3.66">different things that his administration</text>
  <text start="1272.97" dur="4.29">has been able to achieve but the fact of</text>
  <text start="1275.64" dur="3.45">the matter is is that if he&amp;#39;s not able</text>
  <text start="1277.26" dur="3.81">to blow his own horn others will use it</text>
  <text start="1279.09" dur="4.23">as a spittoon and that&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="1281.07" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;ve done right so you know he goes</text>
  <text start="1283.32" dur="4.02">on these rallies he pumps himself up and</text>
  <text start="1285.24" dur="3.36">let&amp;#39;s face it that&amp;#39;s how he&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="1287.34" dur="3.089">came to be in the first place even</text>
  <text start="1288.6" dur="3.63">before he was POTUS he always knew the</text>

  <text start="1292.23" dur="3.69">over into politics and that&amp;#39;s why I say</text>
  <text start="1294.63" dur="3.21">real I really think this is going to</text>
  <text start="1295.92" dur="4.68">change things in modern-day politics</text>
  <text start="1297.84" dur="4.68">going forward compare and contrast forty</text>
  <text start="1300.6" dur="3.78">five rally versus any single one of the</text>
  <text start="1302.52" dur="3.33">Democrats yeah I think Joe Biden was</text>
