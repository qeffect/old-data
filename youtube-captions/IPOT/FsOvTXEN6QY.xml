  <text start="22.429" dur="3.84">your host Sir Patrick Mak boys and girls</text>
  <text start="24.619" dur="3.87">I want you to do me a favor and put on</text>
  <text start="26.269" dur="3.35">your possibility pants right now because</text>
  <text start="28.489" dur="3.991">we&amp;#39;re gonna kick around some</text>
  <text start="29.619" dur="4.33">possibilities in regards to a topic that</text>
  <text start="32.48" dur="3.929">I&amp;#39;ve been kind of teasing out for the</text>
  <text start="33.949" dur="4.081">last five or six months but to be fair</text>
  <text start="36.409" dur="3.601">I&amp;#39;ve been a little bit vague for good</text>
  <text start="38.03" dur="4.14">reason but right now I think I&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="40.01" dur="5.46">articulate some of these ideas and all</text>
  <text start="42.17" dur="5.669">I&amp;#39;m asking of you right now is to simply</text>
  <text start="45.47" dur="4.979">take it in and reserve your judgment and</text>
  <text start="47.839" dur="4.86">hold off on your contrarian arguments at</text>
  <text start="50.449" dur="3.78">least until you&amp;#39;ve heard what I had to</text>
  <text start="52.699" dur="2.911">say and then of course from there you</text>
  <text start="54.229" dur="3.661">were more than welcome to think whatever</text>
  <text start="55.61" dur="5.43">you like even if it just means that hey</text>
  <text start="57.89" dur="4.86">Patrick I think you&amp;#39;re full of crap you</text>
  <text start="61.04" dur="3.329">might be right I&amp;#39;d have to admit that</text>
  <text start="62.75" dur="4.68">because I got my possibility pants on</text>
  <text start="64.369" dur="5.161">anyway as you can see we have 3q posts</text>
  <text start="67.43" dur="5.31">right here in front of us the first one</text>
  <text start="69.53" dur="6.03">is from yesterday 36 24 from the 24th of</text>
  <text start="72.74" dur="5.97">November it&amp;#39;s going to be biblical the</text>
  <text start="75.56" dur="5.699">Great Awakening and we were talking</text>
  <text start="78.71" dur="4.14">about Rudy Giuliani and his status now</text>
  <text start="81.259" dur="5.311">the other one is three five six five</text>
  <text start="82.85" dur="4.47">from the 31st of July and this one was</text>
  <text start="86.57" dur="2.909">referring to</text>
  <text start="87.32" dur="3.72">Godfather three it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="89.479" dur="3.481">biblical and it was another Twitter</text>
  <text start="91.04" dur="3.119">status only this time it was to the Pope</text>
  <text start="92.96" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;re gonna have a look at both of those</text>
  <text start="94.159" dur="6.601">then the last one is from 1455 from the</text>
  <text start="97.7" dur="5.52">12th of June of 2018 and we were in</text>

  <text start="107.99" dur="2.91">Allah will go into it don&amp;#39;t worry about</text>
  <text start="109.67" dur="3.3">it I just want to point out what they</text>
  <text start="110.9" dur="5.07">are and they all have one theme in</text>
  <text start="112.97" dur="4.38">common right the word biblical now this</text>
  <text start="115.97" dur="2.97">is a topic that we&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="117.35" dur="3.84">before and I&amp;#39;ve offered up a very</text>
  <text start="118.94" dur="3.87">particular idea although like I said I</text>
  <text start="121.19" dur="3.679">think I&amp;#39;ve been a bit vague and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="122.81" dur="4.8">gonna clarify a little bit more today</text>
  <text start="124.869" dur="4.18">now they&amp;#39;re going to be some of you</text>
  <text start="127.61" dur="2.879">actually know there are many of you that</text>
  <text start="129.049" dur="3.66">have emailed me about this it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="130.489" dur="3.931">popular topic and I think that many of</text>
  <text start="132.709" dur="3.961">you are on the right track also talking</text>
  <text start="134.42" dur="4.14">about you know obviously the biblical</text>
  <text start="136.67" dur="4.649">proportions and the you know the</text>
  <text start="138.56" dur="4.14">obviously the massive scope that all of</text>
  <text start="141.319" dur="3.48">this that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about for</text>
  <text start="142.7" dur="3.63">the last two years is involved with now</text>
  <text start="144.799" dur="3.181">I want to point out that I think you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="146.33" dur="3.12">also correct but I want to show you</text>
  <text start="147.98" dur="3.929">where I think there&amp;#39;s a little bit of a</text>
  <text start="149.45" dur="4.17">separation between these ideas what I</text>
  <text start="151.909" dur="4.11">think they might mean</text>
  <text start="153.62" dur="4.619">and how that is relevant to what we are</text>
  <text start="156.019" dur="4.891">looking at in the news right now let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="158.239" dur="5.041">start off with this first one 36 24 from</text>
  <text start="160.91" dur="4.95">just the other day we had a Twitter</text>
  <text start="163.28" dur="5.429">status to Rudy Giuliani and cue said</text>
  <text start="165.86" dur="5.489">it&amp;#39;s going to be biblical the Great</text>
  <text start="168.709" dur="4.441">Awakening now the status to Rudy</text>
  <text start="171.349" dur="3.241">Giuliani said this I discovered a</text>
  <text start="173.15" dur="3.419">pattern of corruption that the</text>
  <text start="174.59" dur="4.28">Washington press covered up for years</text>
  <text start="176.569" dur="4.92">I&amp;#39;m also going to bring out a massive</text>
  <text start="178.87" dur="4.36">pay-for-play scheme under the Obama</text>
  <text start="181.489" dur="3.991">administration that will devastate the</text>
  <text start="183.23" dur="4.77">Democrat Party do you honestly think I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="185.48" dur="4.289">intimidated there&amp;#39;s a lot there and if</text>
  <text start="188" dur="3.87">you are on social media particularly</text>
  <text start="189.769" dur="5.28">Twitter you will notice that Rudy</text>
  <text start="191.87" dur="4.83">Giuliani has grown increasingly bold and</text>
  <text start="195.049" dur="4.321">brash and I think that&amp;#39;s for very good</text>
  <text start="196.7" dur="4.379">reason keep in mind Rudy Giuliani shtick</text>
  <text start="199.37" dur="3.42">has always been a little bit Colombo</text>
  <text start="201.079" dur="4.201">right he always kind of plays himself</text>
  <text start="202.79" dur="5.07">like the bumbling drunken fool meanwhile</text>
  <text start="205.28" dur="4.83">he takes down the mob and this guy&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="207.86" dur="4.29">joke but there&amp;#39;s a reason for this tough</text>
  <text start="210.11" dur="4.2">talk I think and I also think that he is</text>
  <text start="212.15" dur="4.26">truly responding to tough talk being</text>
  <text start="214.31" dur="3.36">directed his way I think there are some</text>
  <text start="216.41" dur="4.199">people that really would like to see</text>
  <text start="217.67" dur="5.34">Rudy Giuliani go away and I think Rudy</text>
  <text start="220.609" dur="4.291">is sort of sarcastically addressing this</text>
  <text start="223.01" dur="3.84">now I want to show you another one here</text>
  <text start="224.9" dur="3.869">and we covered this the other day too</text>
  <text start="226.85" dur="3.3">truth alert the statement I&amp;#39;ve made</text>
  <text start="228.769" dur="3.651">several times of having an insurance</text>
  <text start="230.15" dur="5.01">policy if thrown under the bus is</text>
  <text start="232.42" dur="5.319">sarcastic and relates to the files in my</text>
  <text start="235.16" dur="5.22">safe about the Biden family&amp;#39;s four</text>
  <text start="237.739" dur="3.961">decade monetizing of his office if I</text>
  <text start="240.38" dur="4.35">disappear it will appear immediately</text>
  <text start="241.7" dur="4.649">along with my Rico chart all right well</text>
  <text start="244.73" dur="3.839">this is some pretty crazy stuff and this</text>
  <text start="246.349" dur="4.26">is actually really bold talk from Rudy</text>
  <text start="248.569" dur="4.081">Giuliani and there&amp;#39;s quite a few things</text>
  <text start="250.609" dur="4.53">I&amp;#39;m not so sure that I understand the</text>
  <text start="252.65" dur="3.959">scope of this tweet but essentially they</text>
  <text start="255.139" dur="3.331">were kind of clowning him saying that he</text>
  <text start="256.609" dur="3.481">was almost ready to throw POTUS under</text>
  <text start="258.47" dur="3.449">the bus but the fact of the matter is</text>
  <text start="260.09" dur="3.84">that he was throwing out some very very</text>
  <text start="261.919" dur="3.361">obvious clues one of them I want to</text>
  <text start="263.93" dur="3.81">direct your attention to is the fact</text>
  <text start="265.28" dur="8.609">that he&amp;#39;s talking about files in his</text>
  <text start="267.74" dur="7.5">safe files in his safe and we&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="273.889" dur="3.15">about somebody else recently getting</text>
  <text start="275.24" dur="4.26">caught with some files in his safe right</text>
  <text start="277.039" dur="5.611">one Jeffrey Epstein just filed that away</text>
  <text start="279.5" dur="5.52">in the back of your mind for now but</text>
  <text start="282.65" dur="4.35">either way Rudy Giuliani is talking</text>
  <text start="285.02" dur="5.52">tough now let me read you this one</text>
  <text start="287" dur="5.76">new 21st just saw a bland Simpson of</text>
  <text start="290.54" dur="4.77">course Glenn Simpson is from fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="292.76" dur="5.04">who told me he was never in Ukraine I</text>
  <text start="295.31" dur="4.68">said I would check my sources but now it</text>
  <text start="297.8" dur="4.74">becomes even more suspicious how his</text>

  <text start="302.54" dur="5.97">husband and to DOJ officials regarding</text>

  <text start="308.51" dur="3.87">happened to the ORS well that&amp;#39;s a really</text>
  <text start="310.94" dur="3.18">good question and I&amp;#39;ve said for a long</text>
  <text start="312.38" dur="2.88">time that the orders were very key in</text>
  <text start="314.12" dur="3.78">this whole thing because they were the</text>
  <text start="315.26" dur="4.47">ones actually transmitting the message</text>
  <text start="317.9" dur="3.3">but the thing I want to direct your</text>
  <text start="319.73" dur="3.12">attention to on this one is that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="321.2" dur="4.41">talking about checking his sources</text>

  <text start="397.25" dur="2.55">kind of reminding me that hey I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="398.479" dur="4.021">think this black ledger was worth</text>
  <text start="399.8" dur="4.26">anything like I said let&amp;#39;s not worry so</text>
  <text start="402.5" dur="2.25">much about the validity of this book</text>
  <text start="404.06" dur="2.73">just yet</text>
  <text start="404.75" dur="6.09">all I want to point out is that Rudy</text>
  <text start="406.79" dur="5.76">Giuliani really needed to know please</text>
  <text start="410.84" dur="4.29">tell him I got to know</text>

  <text start="417.32" dur="4.05">back and said there wasn&amp;#39;t a black book</text>
  <text start="419.96" dur="3.2">now we&amp;#39;re gonna cruise</text>
  <text start="421.37" dur="4.59">here the emergence of the ledger</text>
  <text start="423.16" dur="4.9">prompted bad press for mana for in the</text>

  <text start="433.91" dur="4.77">because this created bad press for not</text>
  <text start="436.82" dur="3.39">only mana for but for Trump and of</text>
  <text start="438.68" dur="3.42">course they wanted to connect Trump for</text>
  <text start="440.21" dur="4.89">mana for and this is where we started to</text>
  <text start="442.1" dur="5.67">suspect that Paul mana 4 was a plan</text>
  <text start="445.1" dur="5.43">which makes him plant forward but is he</text>

  <text start="459.38" dur="6">Ukrainians interfered in 2016 on behalf</text>
  <text start="462.919" dur="4.891">of Clinton a theory that was previously</text>

  <text start="571.97" dur="5.34">really prefer to see that happen with</text>

  <text start="577.31" dur="3.87">story we know that that wasn&amp;#39;t true</text>

  <text start="628.16" dur="4.29">paint a picture of Paul Manafort because</text>
  <text start="630.23" dur="3.72">I think he really kind of embodies this</text>

  <text start="817.98" dur="2.79">now let me skip you down aways here they</text>
  <text start="819.69" dur="3.27">were talking about the Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="820.77" dur="3.66">revolution and how mana fort was sort of</text>
  <text start="822.96" dur="4.05">laying low he was having family problems</text>
  <text start="824.43" dur="5.73">and whatnot and he kind of reimburses in</text>
  <text start="827.01" dur="5.22">2016 by the early months of 2016</text>
  <text start="830.16" dur="4.44">mana fort was back in Greater Washington</text>
  <text start="832.23" dur="3.63">his main residence and the place where</text>
  <text start="834.6" dur="4.32">he&amp;#39;d begun his career as a political</text>
  <text start="835.86" dur="5.25">consultant and lobbyist but his attempts</text>
  <text start="838.92" dur="4.68">at rehabilitation of his family life his</text>
  <text start="841.11" dur="4.14">career his sense of self-worth continued</text>
  <text start="843.6" dur="3.54">he began to make a different set of</text>
  <text start="845.25" dur="3.72">calls as he watched the u.s.</text>
  <text start="847.14" dur="4.38">presidential campaign take an unlikely</text>
  <text start="848.97" dur="5.28">turn he saw an opportunity and he badly</text>
  <text start="851.52" dur="4.83">wanted in he wrote Donald Trump a crisp</text>
  <text start="854.25" dur="4.56">memo listing all the reasons he would be</text>
  <text start="856.35" dur="4.23">an ideal campaign consigliere and then</text>
  <text start="858.81" dur="4.53">implored mutual friends to tout his</text>
  <text start="860.58" dur="4.5">skills to the ascendant candidate okay</text>
  <text start="863.34" dur="3.69">well he&amp;#39;s actually done something like</text>
  <text start="865.08" dur="4.35">this before way back in a day with</text>
  <text start="867.03" dur="3.87">Reagan right but this is very</text>
  <text start="869.43" dur="3.87">interesting and this is the part that I</text>
  <text start="870.9" dur="5.1">don&amp;#39;t really understand fully yet myself</text>
  <text start="873.3" dur="5.46">but what we do know is that most of that</text>
  <text start="876" dur="4.2">is true mana Ford did one in mana fort</text>
  <text start="878.76" dur="2.34">was supposed to be kind of this fixer</text>
  <text start="880.2" dur="2.43">and that was sort of the way they were</text>
  <text start="881.1" dur="2.94">touting him in the media right he was</text>
  <text start="882.63" dur="3">gonna be this fixer and he was gonna be</text>
  <text start="884.04" dur="4.68">they used that word all the time that</text>
  <text start="885.63" dur="6.03">term in regards to him with campaign but</text>
  <text start="888.72" dur="4.65">we also know that Giuliani really wants</text>
  <text start="891.66" dur="4.47">to know what&amp;#39;s up with mana Ford there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="893.37" dur="4.62">information that Giuliani wants from man</text>
  <text start="896.13" dur="3.69">for what that is we don&amp;#39;t know but what</text>
  <text start="897.99" dur="4.35">we do know is that he wants something</text>
  <text start="899.82" dur="3.96">and we also know that whatever it was</text>
  <text start="902.34" dur="4.52">that was supposedly on this ledger</text>
  <text start="903.78" dur="6">whether this was a made-up ledger or not</text>
  <text start="906.86" dur="6.34">it put mana Ford away and it put him</text>
  <text start="909.78" dur="6.48">away Hart solitary mauler put him away</text>
  <text start="913.2" dur="6.69">right and so this is very very curious</text>
  <text start="916.26" dur="7.29">but we should also know he&amp;#39;s still alive</text>
  <text start="919.89" dur="5.31">and that&amp;#39;s an important fact to note but</text>
  <text start="923.55" dur="3.6">he wanted in on the Trump campaign now</text>
  <text start="925.2" dur="3.45">was he really really trying to help out</text>
  <text start="927.15" dur="4.2">with something was he just having</text>
  <text start="928.65" dur="4.35">himself crisis of conscience or</text>
  <text start="931.35" dur="3.21">something like that and decides that he</text>
  <text start="933" dur="3.93">wants to go on the straight and narrow</text>
  <text start="934.56" dur="4.56">and decide to go ahead and work for the</text>
  <text start="936.93" dur="4.11">Donald Trump campaign was he simply just</text>
  <text start="939.12" dur="3.99">wanting to push a conservative agenda</text>
  <text start="941.04" dur="4.29">because that&amp;#39;s where his loyalties lie</text>
  <text start="943.11" dur="4.5">anything could kind of be possible with</text>
  <text start="945.33" dur="4.75">Paul manna for right but the fact of the</text>
  <text start="947.61" dur="4.24">matter is is he had the goods</text>
  <text start="950.08" dur="3.51">folks now let&amp;#39;s skip down a little bit</text>
  <text start="951.85" dur="3.54">further here his friends like all</text>
  <text start="953.59" dur="4.29">Republican political operatives of a</text>
  <text start="955.39" dur="4.44">certain age could recite the legend of</text>
  <text start="957.88" dur="4.5">Paul Manafort which they did with</text>
  <text start="959.83" dur="3.84">fascination Envy and occasional disdain</text>
  <text start="962.38" dur="3.12">all right well that&amp;#39;s a bit theatrical</text>
  <text start="963.67" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re from the Atlantic but it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="965.5" dur="3.75">telling isn&amp;#39;t it it shows that there</text>
  <text start="967.84" dur="3.78">were a lot of people that really were</text>
  <text start="969.25" dur="4.86">kind of in awe of Paul Manafort whether</text>
  <text start="971.62" dur="4.32">they liked him or not but my point is is</text>
  <text start="974.11" dur="3.75">that this guy was not just some guy that</text>
  <text start="975.94" dur="3.39">happened to be able to hang around as</text>
  <text start="977.86" dur="3.63">some sort of career politician because</text>
  <text start="979.33" dur="4.35">he wasn&amp;#39;t but he&amp;#39;s been in these elite</text>
  <text start="981.49" dur="4.89">circles for a very long time making tens</text>
  <text start="983.68" dur="5.91">of millions of dollars wielding a lot of</text>
  <text start="986.38" dur="5.16">power this guy wasn&amp;#39;t a scrub he was a</text>
  <text start="989.59" dur="4.56">baller let&amp;#39;s take you down a little bit</text>
  <text start="991.54" dur="4.71">further down here when Paul Manafort</text>
  <text start="994.15" dur="5.52">officially joined the Trump campaign on</text>
  <text start="996.25" dur="5.76">March 28 2016 he represented a danger</text>
  <text start="999.67" dur="4.71">not only to himself but to the political</text>
  <text start="1002.01" dur="4.71">organization he would ultimately run and</text>
  <text start="1004.38" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s very curious isn&amp;#39;t it why did</text>
  <text start="1006.72" dur="5.13">Paul Manafort decide to join this where</text>
  <text start="1008.85" dur="5.28">was his loyalty when he decided to jump</text>
  <text start="1011.85" dur="4.62">on this surely he must have known that</text>
  <text start="1014.13" dur="4.65">he was going to be a big-time Public</text>
  <text start="1016.47" dur="5.1">Enemy so was he doing this simply for</text>
  <text start="1018.78" dur="5.01">the sake of trying to gather more wealth</text>
  <text start="1021.57" dur="4.98">from maybe conservative circles was he</text>
  <text start="1023.79" dur="5.159">doing this to be a true plant and tried</text>
  <text start="1026.55" dur="5.31">to basically railroad the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="1028.949" dur="6.181">or was he trying to rescue the Trump</text>
  <text start="1031.86" dur="5.339">campaign and help along basically what</text>
  <text start="1035.13" dur="4.53">was going to be the take down of this</text>
  <text start="1037.199" dur="6.061">deep state that honestly he was a big</text>
  <text start="1039.66" dur="5.58">part of either way it&amp;#39;s curious over the</text>
  <text start="1043.26" dur="3.66">decades mana fort had cut a trail of</text>
  <text start="1045.24" dur="4.17">foreign money and influence into</text>
  <text start="1046.92" dur="4.68">Washington then built that trail into a</text>
  <text start="1049.41" dur="3.9">superhighway when it comes to serving</text>
  <text start="1051.6" dur="4.02">the interests of the world&amp;#39;s autocrats</text>
  <text start="1053.31" dur="3.78">he&amp;#39;s been a great innovator his</text>

  <text start="1063.3" dur="4.92">corruption yeah probably all true this</text>
  <text start="1065.7" dur="4.98">guy is a life-long knucklehead he has</text>
  <text start="1068.22" dur="4.83">pleaded not guilty to all charges but</text>
  <text start="1070.68" dur="4.65">man affords role and mores broader</text>
  <text start="1073.05" dur="4.2">narrative remains carefully guarded and</text>
  <text start="1075.33" dur="3.61">unknown to the public and that is a very</text>
  <text start="1077.25" dur="3.07">telling lie</text>
  <text start="1078.94" dur="3.48">and this is sort of illustrating the</text>
  <text start="1080.32" dur="4.41">point that I really really want to show</text>
  <text start="1082.42" dur="3.96">Paul Manafort ladies and gentlemen I</text>
  <text start="1084.73" dur="4.62">don&amp;#39;t really think was any kind of good</text>
  <text start="1086.38" dur="5.13">guy this guy is a lifelong knucklehead</text>
  <text start="1089.35" dur="4.56">that was essentially willing to make</text>
  <text start="1091.51" dur="4.2">tons and tons of money off of whomever</text>
  <text start="1093.91" dur="3.27">now he probably has some personal</text>
  <text start="1095.71" dur="3.81">politics and I&amp;#39;m sure that he&amp;#39;d love to</text>

  <text start="1099.52" dur="3.66">fact of the matter is whether it was</text>
  <text start="1100.87" dur="5.13">foreign or domestic money he didn&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="1103.18" dur="6.99">he was in on it he was all about Paul</text>
  <text start="1106" dur="6.39">Manafort however I&amp;#39;m not necessarily</text>
  <text start="1110.17" dur="5.73">sure that I&amp;#39;m ready to lump mana Ford</text>

  <text start="1115.9" dur="4.26">because that&amp;#39;s where this story gets</text>
  <text start="1117.88" dur="5.16">really curious why did Paul Manafort</text>
  <text start="1120.16" dur="5.37">join the Trump campaign was he really</text>
  <text start="1123.04" dur="5.16">trying to bring it down and if so why is</text>
  <text start="1125.53" dur="5.55">he sitting there in prison and if he</text>
  <text start="1128.2" dur="4.77">really is an asset why is he not dead</text>
  <text start="1131.08" dur="4.38">because I think we all know how that</text>
  <text start="1132.97" dur="4.68">happens right so it&amp;#39;s really hard to</text>
  <text start="1135.46" dur="3.66">know and I think that what makes Paul</text>
  <text start="1137.65" dur="3.3">manna for its role in all this so</text>
  <text start="1139.12" dur="5.25">curious is the fact that he simply just</text>
  <text start="1140.95" dur="5.22">put away but that lines very telling but</text>

  <text start="1171.58" dur="3.36">sort of one of those legend type stories</text>
  <text start="1173.65" dur="3.18">he&amp;#39;s been around for a really really</text>
  <text start="1174.94" dur="3.45">long time and I guess that&amp;#39;s really what</text>
  <text start="1176.83" dur="4.8">I want to establish at least at this</text>
  <text start="1178.39" dur="6.12">point in the video Paul Manafort was a</text>
  <text start="1181.63" dur="6.09">big-time fixture and he had a lot of</text>

  <text start="1187.72" dur="4.11">lot of people were very influenced by</text>

  <text start="1191.83" dur="4.14">this was a smart person this is a person</text>

  <text start="1195.97" dur="4.14">a person with incredible social skills</text>
  <text start="1197.95" dur="4.14">and from what it seems he was probably</text>
  <text start="1200.11" dur="4.29">like President Trump an obsessive</text>
  <text start="1202.09" dur="4.2">note-taker and a person who knows all</text>
  <text start="1204.4" dur="4.71">these people and wields all of his power</text>
  <text start="1206.29" dur="4.95">usually holds a ton of information and</text>

  <text start="1226.149" dur="5.01">lots of different people now we do know</text>
  <text start="1228.7" dur="4.38">that the story is is that this ledger</text>
  <text start="1231.159" dur="3.811">was what took him away but we also know</text>
  <text start="1233.08" dur="5.43">that the source of that ledger now has</text>

  <text start="1240.19" dur="4.68">for Hillary Clinton and Trump we do know</text>
  <text start="1242.2" dur="4.77">that they were supporting Hillary so it</text>
  <text start="1244.87" dur="4.65">calls into the question the ledger again</text>
  <text start="1246.97" dur="5.25">but let&amp;#39;s also consider the classic</text>

  <text start="1331.86" dur="5.23">just a few days later on the 12th of</text>
  <text start="1334.63" dur="4.14">October please check these out because</text>
  <text start="1337.09" dur="3.93">this will give some background here but</text>
  <text start="1338.77" dur="3.659">just in general we were talking about a</text>
  <text start="1341.02" dur="2.859">few different things we were talking</text>
  <text start="1342.429" dur="3.94">about a raid on</text>
  <text start="1343.879" dur="4.2">vatican from their own anti-corruption</text>
  <text start="1346.369" dur="3">bureau that&amp;#39;s funny we were just talking</text>
  <text start="1348.079" dur="3.27">about of anti-corruption bureau in</text>
  <text start="1349.369" dur="4.83">ukraine but yeah that&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="1351.349" dur="5.22">indeed the vatican got raided by their</text>
  <text start="1354.199" dur="5.97">own anti-corruption bureau and what they</text>
  <text start="1356.569" dur="5.97">found was a massive bunch of again looks</text>
  <text start="1360.169" dur="4.98">like pay-to-play kinds of schemes money</text>
  <text start="1362.539" dur="4.05">laundering schemes tons of money now be</text>
  <text start="1365.149" dur="3.69">stories involved a lot of different</text>
  <text start="1366.589" dur="3.93">things and it did involve human</text>
  <text start="1368.839" dur="4.47">trafficking I think that&amp;#39;s where Q is</text>
  <text start="1370.519" dur="4.35">linking this here too but the point I</text>
  <text start="1373.309" dur="4.71">want to make here is that it was really</text>
  <text start="1374.869" dur="5.37">involving a lot of massive land deals</text>
  <text start="1378.019" dur="4.62">there was one particular deal in which</text>
  <text start="1380.239" dur="4.56">this Cardinal was basically taking up</text>
  <text start="1382.639" dur="4.17">all this land in the UK there was</text>
  <text start="1384.799" dur="3.96">another deal where another Cardinal was</text>
  <text start="1386.809" dur="3.75">funneling money through this cemetery</text>
  <text start="1388.759" dur="4.681">trust fund millions of dollars through a</text>
  <text start="1390.559" dur="5.19">sanitary trust fund it was moving tons</text>
  <text start="1393.44" dur="4.439">of money and it was using and buying up</text>
  <text start="1395.749" dur="4.441">tons of land well a lot of his land</text>
  <text start="1397.879" dur="3.66">seems to be connected to locations that</text>
  <text start="1400.19" dur="3.569">could be connected to human trafficking</text>
  <text start="1401.539" dur="5.01">I think that&amp;#39;s where Q is going here but</text>
  <text start="1403.759" dur="4.681">Q references the movie Godfather 3 well</text>
  <text start="1406.549" dur="4.11">let&amp;#39;s remember the plot of Godfather 3</text>
  <text start="1408.44" dur="5.429">Michael Corleone II who was the mob boss</text>
  <text start="1410.659" dur="4.17">after the death of Fredo decides that</text>
  <text start="1413.869" dur="3.571">he&amp;#39;s gonna go on the straight and narrow</text>
  <text start="1414.829" dur="5.13">too and so what does he do he invests a</text>
  <text start="1417.44" dur="4.169">whole bunch of money into the Catholic</text>
  <text start="1419.959" dur="3.72">Church and I talking about a whole bunch</text>
  <text start="1421.609" dur="4.92">of money now the Catholic Church was</text>
  <text start="1423.679" dur="4.41">struggling for money and of course they</text>
  <text start="1426.529" dur="2.911">wanted something in return he wanted</text>
  <text start="1428.089" dur="4.02">something in return so what did he get</text>
  <text start="1429.44" dur="5.509">he got tons of shares in a Mobley re</text>
  <text start="1432.109" dur="5.4">which was a massive real estate</text>
  <text start="1434.949" dur="4.3">acquisition company ah so it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="1437.509" dur="4.681">like these stories in this cardinal sins</text>
  <text start="1439.249" dur="5.73">were paralleling the movie Godfather 3</text>
  <text start="1442.19" dur="5.159">it&amp;#39;s going to be biblical of course well</text>
  <text start="1444.979" dur="4.47">this human trafficking situation is of</text>
  <text start="1447.349" dur="4.35">course biblical proportions so that</text>
  <text start="1449.449" dur="4.02">could be a reference there to but could</text>

  <text start="1838.57" dur="4.74">choice now remember at the context in</text>
  <text start="1841.06" dur="4.26">this time we were already sort of in</text>
  <text start="1843.31" dur="4.32">cover-up mode okay we&amp;#39;ve already had</text>

  <text start="1864.7" dur="4.08">spying had gone on for years FISA was</text>
  <text start="1867.1" dur="3.42">the cover-up and this seemed to be the</text>

  <text start="1877.389" dur="3.301">you have a choice now this is where it</text>
  <text start="1879.099" dur="4.41">gets curious because Q seems to be</text>
  <text start="1880.69" dur="6.63">talking to more than just the reader sis</text>
  <text start="1883.509" dur="6.9">and we have good agents the time is now</text>
  <text start="1887.32" dur="5.189">contact windows good in brackets and</text>
  <text start="1890.409" dur="3.48">that&amp;#39;s very curious right because that</text>
  <text start="1892.509" dur="3.061">doesn&amp;#39;t sound like something that Q</text>
  <text start="1893.889" dur="3.51">would say to us the average reader</text>
  <text start="1895.57" dur="3.599">sounds like they&amp;#39;re talking to somebody</text>
  <text start="1897.399" dur="3.48">else like they&amp;#39;re giving them a window</text>
  <text start="1899.169" dur="3.6">of contact and I think it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1900.879" dur="4.711">interesting that they use the term good</text>
  <text start="1902.769" dur="6.27">which makes me think of very good as in</text>
  <text start="1905.59" dur="5.309">very good boy is it possible that this</text>
  <text start="1909.039" dur="3.51">term and all these different dog tweets</text>
  <text start="1910.899" dur="3.39">and deer tweets and whatnot I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1912.549" dur="4.021">going to get into all that today but</text>
  <text start="1914.289" dur="4.83">could this be a statement of loyalty</text>
  <text start="1916.57" dur="4.739">saying whether or not their contact is</text>
  <text start="1919.119" dur="3.93">open whether that contact window is open</text>
  <text start="1921.309" dur="3.511">or whether their contact platform is</text>
  <text start="1923.049" dur="3.031">open I couldn&amp;#39;t tell you the exact</text>
  <text start="1924.82" dur="3.929">specifics but I think you see where</text>
  <text start="1926.08" dur="5.459">we&amp;#39;re going with this is this the origin</text>
  <text start="1928.749" dur="5.16">of our very good boy</text>
  <text start="1931.539" dur="6.45">but then again we have the term biblical</text>
  <text start="1933.909" dur="5.73">now in regards to this context the fight</text>
  <text start="1937.989" dur="3.99">between good and evil I guess you could</text>
  <text start="1939.639" dur="3.99">kind of nudge it in there but it seems</text>
  <text start="1941.979" dur="6">again like we&amp;#39;re talking about a whole</text>
  <text start="1943.629" dur="6.75">collection of books books things that</text>
  <text start="1947.979" dur="3.93">were stored in safes some sort of</text>

  <text start="1955.989" dur="4.231">money in different locations so I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="1958.029" dur="5.791">if he had Ledger&amp;#39;s over decades and</text>
  <text start="1960.22" dur="5.519">decades whether it was used as some sort</text>

  <text start="1965.739" dur="3.51">good or bad purposes it doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="1967.72" dur="3.36">matter ladies and gentlemen we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1969.249" dur="4.35">need to assign a black cat or white hat</text>
  <text start="1971.08" dur="4.14">to this the fact is is that it exists</text>
  <text start="1973.599" dur="3.78">and there&amp;#39;s a possibility that more</text>
  <text start="1975.22" dur="4.11">exists and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if a</text>
  <text start="1977.379" dur="3.9">lot of them are still unknown and that</text>
  <text start="1979.33" dur="6">might be the very reason why Paul</text>
  <text start="1981.279" dur="5.911">Manafort is still alive biblical but my</text>
  <text start="1985.33" dur="3.299">point is with all three of these posts</text>
  <text start="1987.19" dur="5.039">is that we don&amp;#39;t seem to be talking</text>

  <text start="2285.42" dur="5.1">Shogun and Lou tanco who both seemed to</text>
  <text start="2288" dur="4.35">maintain the same ideas it looks like</text>
  <text start="2290.52" dur="3.93">luchenko has kind of agreed with</text>
  <text start="2292.35" dur="4.65">Shogun&amp;#39;s findings that hunter Biden was</text>

  <text start="2297" dur="5.07">both been let go let me take you halfway</text>
  <text start="2299.94" dur="4.32">down to the statement here mr. Litts</text>
  <text start="2302.07" dur="4.17">anko stated that there was a black book</text>
  <text start="2304.26" dur="4.41">found near the home of a former deputy</text>
  <text start="2306.24" dur="4.71">of the Ukrainian Secret Service curious</text>
  <text start="2308.67" dur="4.02">person to have that this book contained</text>
  <text start="2310.95" dur="2.46">a list of people who were receiving</text>
  <text start="2312.69" dur="3.12">kickbacks</text>
  <text start="2313.41" dur="4.02">he stated examples such as 3 million</text>
  <text start="2315.81" dur="4.14">dollars for a vote on the state budget</text>
  <text start="2317.43" dur="4.83">by a member of parliament he stated that</text>
  <text start="2319.95" dur="3.78">it wasn&amp;#39;t an actual book just several</text>
  <text start="2322.26" dur="4.29">pieces of paper consisting of</text>
  <text start="2323.73" dur="6.09">approximately 10 to 12 pages long the</text>
  <text start="2326.55" dur="4.53">next day the US media had the story we</text>
  <text start="2329.82" dur="4.68">should already be raising red flags</text>
  <text start="2331.08" dur="5.52">right and a mr. Lysenko who is a member</text>
  <text start="2334.5" dur="4.11">of parliament and a journalist said that</text>
  <text start="2336.6" dur="4.44">Paul man affords name was also in the</text>
  <text start="2338.61" dur="5.52">book mister Lysenko further stated that</text>
  <text start="2341.04" dur="5.94">mr. Lysenko and the US ambassador are</text>
  <text start="2344.13" dur="5.31">close several weeks after the discovery</text>
  <text start="2346.98" dur="5.31">of the black book Naboo which remember</text>
  <text start="2349.44" dur="5.07">was the one who we caught stating that</text>
  <text start="2352.29" dur="6.18">they would prefer Hillary over Trump</text>
  <text start="2354.51" dur="6.66">that Naboo Artem SiC Naboo opened a case</text>
  <text start="2358.47" dur="4.71">at some point during his first week in</text>
  <text start="2361.17" dur="4.35">office mr. Lysenko met with the</text>
  <text start="2363.18" dur="4.68">Ambassador Marie yovanovich where she</text>
  <text start="2365.52" dur="5.58">asked him to close three cases including</text>
  <text start="2367.86" dur="5.58">one against mr. lysenko yeah and some of</text>
  <text start="2371.1" dur="4.8">the other ones involved those NGOs that</text>
  <text start="2373.44" dur="4.71">were involved with George Soros</text>
  <text start="2375.9" dur="4.05">the head of Naboo confirmed that mr.</text>
  <text start="2378.15" dur="5.04">Mann affords name was in the black book</text>
  <text start="2379.95" dur="5.16">however there was no signature where mr.</text>
  <text start="2383.19" dur="2.28">Mann affort would have to sign for the</text>
  <text start="2385.11" dur="3.18">money</text>
  <text start="2385.47" dur="5.43">well that&amp;#39;s what he went away for there</text>
  <text start="2388.29" dur="5.55">is bank transfer to mr. manna for from</text>
  <text start="2390.9" dur="4.77">kyrgyzstan Naboo also confirmed to the</text>
  <text start="2393.84" dur="4.8">press that mr. Mann affords name appears</text>
  <text start="2395.67" dur="6.06">in the black book ah interesting</text>
  <text start="2398.64" dur="4.68">mr. Lysenko who oversees s AP and Naboo</text>
  <text start="2401.73" dur="2.369">cannot inquire about their cases</text>
  <text start="2403.32" dur="3.6">investigate</text>
  <text start="2404.099" dur="5.041">the head of sa p is nazar khaled Natsuki</text>
  <text start="2406.92" dur="4.5">and the head of Naboo is artem sitting</text>
  <text start="2409.14" dur="4.649">it artem sit NIC is the one I just said</text>
  <text start="2411.42" dur="5.22">was caught on audio talking about all</text>
  <text start="2413.789" dur="5.43">that didn&amp;#39;t do not like pnom mr. Khalid</text>
  <text start="2416.64" dur="4.439">miss ki asked mr. sit NIC why would you</text>
  <text start="2419.219" dur="3.84">say there is no signature man affords</text>
  <text start="2421.079" dur="4.17">and mr. sit NIC stated that he wanted</text>
  <text start="2423.059" dur="4.53">Hillary to win so we already knew that</text>
  <text start="2425.249" dur="4.2">right so this is very curious this puts</text>
  <text start="2427.589" dur="3.45">into the question of the validity of</text>
  <text start="2429.449" dur="4.201">everything that brought mana fort down</text>
  <text start="2431.039" dur="4.08">now remember Muller didn&amp;#39;t use the black</text>
  <text start="2433.65" dur="4.589">book stuff as part of his investigation</text>
  <text start="2435.119" dur="5.37">but it was used eventually as part of</text>
  <text start="2438.239" dur="5.04">the criminal investigation so is it</text>
  <text start="2440.489" dur="4.5">legit is it not legit it seems kind of</text>
  <text start="2443.279" dur="3.661">like we don&amp;#39;t really know right and I</text>
  <text start="2444.989" dur="3.3">think that&amp;#39;s precisely my point so there</text>
  <text start="2446.94" dur="3.779">you have it ladies and gentlemen at</text>
  <text start="2448.289" dur="5.25">least for now this is only part of what</text>
  <text start="2450.719" dur="4.951">seems to be a very large saga I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2453.539" dur="5.07">even gotten into Roger stone longtime</text>
  <text start="2455.67" dur="4.47">friend and colleague of one Paul manna</text>
  <text start="2458.609" dur="3.93">for what else do they have in common</text>
  <text start="2460.14" dur="5.399">their homes were raided with extreme</text>
  <text start="2462.539" dur="4.92">prejudice and highly publicized</text>
  <text start="2465.539" dur="3.75">meaning they wanted the world to know</text>
  <text start="2467.459" dur="3.66">that they were raiding these men&amp;#39;s home</text>
  <text start="2469.289" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t get yourself about Roger stone</text>
  <text start="2471.119" dur="3.99">much more influential than you might</text>
  <text start="2473.099" dur="4.38">think and has been for about as long as</text>
  <text start="2475.109" dur="5.311">Paul man afford house and like I said</text>
  <text start="2477.479" dur="5.52">their homes being raided and shown all</text>
  <text start="2480.42" dur="5.01">over TV seems to suggest something both</text>
  <text start="2482.999" dur="5.82">of these men were put away and put away</text>
  <text start="2485.43" dur="5.49">hard why what do they know and why did</text>
  <text start="2488.819" dur="6.361">they raid their homes what were they</text>
  <text start="2490.92" dur="7.679">looking for boxes and boxes</text>
  <text start="2495.18" dur="6.119">perhaps Ledger&amp;#39;s perhaps is this all</text>
  <text start="2498.599" dur="5.22">biblical you tell me but the point I</text>
  <text start="2501.299" dur="4.98">want to make is that Paul Manafort seems</text>
  <text start="2503.819" dur="4.92">to be very central to this entire saga</text>
  <text start="2506.279" dur="5.58">and yet no one is talking about Paul</text>
  <text start="2508.739" dur="4.98">Manafort very similar in the way we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2511.859" dur="4.47">taken approach to this Jeffrey Epstein</text>
  <text start="2513.719" dur="4.86">story in the mainstream media doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2516.329" dur="4.41">seem to be a story that anybody wants to</text>
  <text start="2518.579" dur="4.2">touch but it seems to be a story that</text>
  <text start="2520.739" dur="5.76">eventually everything starts to come</text>
  <text start="2522.779" dur="6.18">back to after all Jeffrey Epstein was</text>
  <text start="2526.499" dur="4.62">supposedly suicided at the same prison</text>
  <text start="2528.959" dur="6.3">where they had kept Paul Manafort</text>
  <text start="2531.119" dur="6.811">and El Chapo El Chapo Jeffrey Epstein</text>
  <text start="2535.259" dur="4.621">shared the same lawyer I don&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="2537.93" dur="4.29">her name and the top of my head her last</text>
  <text start="2539.88" dur="3.87">name is Cologne but they all were held</text>
  <text start="2542.22" dur="3.57">at the same place Paul Manafort</text>
  <text start="2543.75" dur="4.17">eventually moved El Chapo eventually</text>
  <text start="2545.79" dur="4.799">moved and of course I think we know what</text>
  <text start="2547.92" dur="4.86">happened or didn&amp;#39;t happen with Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="2550.589" dur="4.561">Epstein but ladies and gentlemen if</text>
  <text start="2552.78" dur="4.38">Naboo and this black ledger which</text>
  <text start="2555.15" dur="5.4">doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have Paul Manafort</text>
  <text start="2557.16" dur="6.11">signature it&amp;#39;s not legit you must acquit</text>
  <text start="2560.55" dur="5.64">no it&amp;#39;s just super suspect right</text>
  <text start="2563.27" dur="5.799">obviously all these years that Paul</text>
  <text start="2566.19" dur="5.22">Manafort had all this on everyone else</text>
  <text start="2569.069" dur="4.711">and he gets brought down by a ledger</text>
  <text start="2571.41" dur="5.28">sounds like projection to me sounds like</text>
  <text start="2573.78" dur="5.16">classic projection and we have a lot of</text>
  <text start="2576.69" dur="4.5">evidence to show that Paul Manafort</text>
  <text start="2578.94" dur="3.869">likely has the goods on a lot of</text>
  <text start="2581.19" dur="3.629">different people in a lot of different</text>
  <text start="2582.809" dur="4.02">areas and it all seems to come right</text>
