  <text start="747.99" dur="6">that we don&amp;#39;t love to talk about but</text>
  <text start="749.819" dur="7.71">it&amp;#39;s relevant and we can see here that</text>
  <text start="753.99" dur="7.079">it evidently it&amp;#39;s prevalent and they</text>
  <text start="757.529" dur="5.701">know we know post 1807 we get these</text>
  <text start="761.069" dur="4.77">graphics here in title we know one we</text>
  <text start="763.23" dur="4.229">know two and we know three we know one</text>
  <text start="765.839" dur="3">show some communications something</text>
  <text start="767.459" dur="3.81">between some various reporters and</text>
  <text start="768.839" dur="3.921">various special agents in charge and</text>
  <text start="771.269" dur="4.231">there&amp;#39;s lots of different people that</text>
  <text start="772.76" dur="4.6">were communicating in and out with these</text>
  <text start="775.5" dur="4.35">reporters now the way to read this is</text>
  <text start="777.36" dur="3.87">very simple you see some arrows are and</text>
  <text start="779.85" dur="3.54">I&amp;#39;m sorry I can&amp;#39;t blow this up anymore</text>
  <text start="781.23" dur="3.75">but some arrows are going both ways some</text>
  <text start="783.39" dur="3.03">are going in some are going out that</text>
  <text start="784.98" dur="4.08">you&amp;#39;ll be able to tell and then the</text>
  <text start="786.42" dur="4.38">numbers you can see the different amount</text>
  <text start="789.06" dur="3.81">of frequency in which these</text>
  <text start="790.8" dur="3.99">communications took place some of the</text>
  <text start="792.87" dur="3.69">most over here in particular is this</text>
  <text start="794.79" dur="3.51">particular special agent-in-charge had</text>
  <text start="796.56" dur="5.759">30 communications with this reporter</text>
  <text start="798.3" dur="5.7">this FBI executive had 26 so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="802.319" dur="3.151">some that obviously have had more than</text>
  <text start="804" dur="3.3">others but that&amp;#39;s how you can kind of</text>
  <text start="805.47" dur="2.66">read that but Q is basically showing</text>
  <text start="807.3" dur="2.15">this this</text>
  <text start="808.13" dur="6.21">structure and this is from the IG report</text>
  <text start="809.45" dur="6.24">which Q also included and that&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="814.34" dur="4.02">here incidentally we&amp;#39;ll take a look at</text>
  <text start="815.69" dur="6.42">in just a second but here&amp;#39;s the second</text>
  <text start="818.36" dur="5.73">one called we know - and once again you</text>
  <text start="822.11" dur="4.62">can see a lot of communications between</text>
  <text start="824.09" dur="4.26">this particular FBI executive and the</text>
  <text start="826.73" dur="4.14">reporter but basically Q&amp;#39;s pointing out</text>
  <text start="828.35" dur="6.8">this is how it all worked this is how</text>
  <text start="830.87" dur="7.4">information was spread and shared and</text>
  <text start="835.15" dur="5.71">then we get down here - we know three</text>
  <text start="838.27" dur="7.75">this is the chain of command for the mid</text>
  <text start="840.86" dur="7.44">year investigation and here you see at</text>
  <text start="846.02" dur="4.5">the top G chief of staff Jim or Vickie</text>
  <text start="848.3" dur="5.64">fire James Comey fired Andrew McCabe</text>
  <text start="850.52" dur="8.73">fire and Lisa Paige fired Jim Baker</text>
  <text start="853.94" dur="8.31">fired and then we get down here we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="859.25" dur="7.17">look back at that in just a second Q</text>
  <text start="862.25" dur="6.6">post this from May talking about this is</text>
  <text start="866.42" dur="5.76">showing the FBI and DOJ all the people</text>
  <text start="868.85" dur="6.75">that were fired or retired or whatever</text>
  <text start="872.18" dur="5.94">all the ones that left and then Q adds</text>
  <text start="875.6" dur="3.81">on by giving us this right here which of</text>
  <text start="878.12" dur="3.54">course is this now we&amp;#39;re not gonna go</text>
  <text start="879.41" dur="3.78">away in the business of 568 page</text>
  <text start="881.66" dur="3.78">document and you&amp;#39;ve seen it before okay</text>
  <text start="883.19" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s the OIG report which leads me to</text>
  <text start="885.44" dur="4.98">think that these 20 pages that are going</text>
  <text start="887.33" dur="5.4">to be unredacted are likely to come very</text>
  <text start="890.42" dur="3.48">soon if they&amp;#39;re not out already in some</text>
  <text start="892.73" dur="4.23">form but I&amp;#39;m assuming that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="893.9" dur="5.49">gonna drop next Q points is to figure</text>
  <text start="896.96" dur="4.29">three point one the FBI chain of command</text>
  <text start="899.39" dur="4.62">for the meteor investigation all right</text>
  <text start="901.25" dur="5.13">and that&amp;#39;s this right here and then</text>
  <text start="904.01" dur="4.14">reminds us that James Comey was fired</text>
  <text start="906.38" dur="3.93">Jim rebecky Andrew McCabe just like I</text>
  <text start="908.15" dur="5.61">told you James Baker fired bill priest</text>
  <text start="910.31" dur="6.36">EPS power removed cooperating witness</text>
  <text start="913.76" dur="4.92">okay and Lisa Paige was fired Peter</text>
  <text start="916.67" dur="3.06">struck lead investigator Deputy</text>
  <text start="918.68" dur="3.54">Assistant Director of</text>

  <text start="922.22" dur="4.05">escorted out while we&amp;#39;re on Peter struck</text>
  <text start="924.44" dur="3.27">let me touch on this really really quick</text>
  <text start="926.27" dur="4.59">a lot of you guys were asking about the</text>
  <text start="927.71" dur="7.02">coke-bottle thing from yesterday&amp;#39;s video</text>
  <text start="930.86" dur="5.4">in relations to this girl Kate who</text>
  <text start="934.73" dur="3.87">wanted to hug Trump at the rally</text>
  <text start="936.26" dur="4.11">yesterday now clearly there was</text>
  <text start="938.6" dur="2.91">something up to that coke bottle on</text>
  <text start="940.37" dur="3.96">Peters trucks</text>
  <text start="941.51" dur="4.47">table when he was testifying he was</text>
  <text start="944.33" dur="3.42">clearly sending out a message I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="945.98" dur="4.29">think it was to that particular Kate</text>
  <text start="947.75" dur="5.07">however I do think there&amp;#39;s something to</text>
  <text start="950.27" dur="5.73">the coke-bottle that&amp;#39;s just my opinion</text>
  <text start="952.82" dur="4.98">now Q takes us to this section and new</text>
  <text start="956" dur="3.08">names and not necessarily new names but</text>
  <text start="957.8" dur="5.58">new names I&amp;#39;m a list</text>

  <text start="970.04" dur="6.92">Tichina Gauhar well they were shown here</text>
  <text start="973.82" dur="5.4">on this chart looks like they were our</text>
  <text start="976.96" dur="4.36">attorneys one and two remember when</text>
  <text start="979.22" dur="4.5">Devin Nunez was asking about the one who</text>
  <text start="981.32" dur="6.03">spoke French could this event our</text>
  <text start="983.72" dur="6.06">Tichina Gauhar now this is very</text>
  <text start="987.35" dur="4.47">interesting because we were just talking</text>
  <text start="989.78" dur="6.27">about coke bottles as well too if you</text>
  <text start="991.82" dur="6.9">remember Mike Pompeo testified before</text>
  <text start="996.05" dur="6.42">the Foreign Intelligence Committee in</text>
  <text start="998.72" dur="6.33">regards to Helsinki and he had himself a</text>
  <text start="1002.47" dur="4.58">little coke bottle too and on that coke</text>
  <text start="1005.05" dur="3.3">bottle looks to be the name Tanisha</text>

  <text start="1008.35" dur="6.06">Tichina Tanisha Tichina uh</text>
  <text start="1012.01" dur="4.23">I don&amp;#39;t know but it looks like some</text>
  <text start="1014.41" dur="3.24">messages are getting passed on bottles</text>
  <text start="1016.24" dur="2.76">and coke bottles and all that kind of</text>
  <text start="1017.65" dur="5.64">stuff interesting stuff</text>
  <text start="1019" dur="6.36">now look not exactly sure where all of</text>
  <text start="1023.29" dur="3.63">these new names fit in but it looks like</text>
  <text start="1025.36" dur="4.29">our conversation which was between this</text>
  <text start="1026.92" dur="5.34">Cline&amp;#39;s myth and this Gauhar and Klein&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1029.65" dur="5.22">myth had a connection to Sally Moyer as</text>
  <text start="1032.26" dur="5.49">well as you can see in the chart here</text>
  <text start="1034.87" dur="6.39">Supervisory Special Agent Sally Moyer</text>
  <text start="1037.75" dur="6.15">who was in contact with Peter struck so</text>
  <text start="1041.26" dur="4.62">that leads me to think that proposing</text>
  <text start="1043.9" dur="3.99">that possibly there was a message being</text>
  <text start="1045.88" dur="5.52">sent on that coke bottle from Pompeo as</text>
  <text start="1047.89" dur="4.59">well alright so as far as what happens</text>
  <text start="1051.4" dur="3.78">with these new names it wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1052.48" dur="7.32">surprise me if these 20 pages are gonna</text>
  <text start="1055.18" dur="7.74">show not exactly not only how but who</text>
  <text start="1059.8" dur="4.53">all these connections were and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1062.92" dur="3.15">gonna probably show some very very</text>
  <text start="1064.33" dur="5.22">damning connections that&amp;#39;s gonna bring</text>
  <text start="1066.07" dur="5.73">this all down q says nothing to see here</text>
  <text start="1069.55" dur="4.44">logical thinking biggest cover-up in the</text>
  <text start="1071.8" dur="3.75">US history attempted yeah well they</text>
  <text start="1073.99" dur="3.54">didn&amp;#39;t quite pull it off too</text>
  <text start="1075.55" dur="5.1">now I&amp;#39;m not exactly sure what classified</text>
  <text start="1077.53" dur="5.79">f and if it&amp;#39;s in relations to some sort</text>
  <text start="1080.65" dur="4.89">of intelligence level but I&amp;#39;ll tell you</text>
  <text start="1083.32" dur="5.45">that I saw this just looking at it from</text>
  <text start="1085.54" dur="6">afar like so I just noticed the class F</text>
  <text start="1088.77" dur="4.69">attempted as the two words and brackets</text>
  <text start="1091.54" dur="3.93">now is it possible that Q could be</text>
  <text start="1093.46" dur="4.71">indicating that there was a possible</text>
  <text start="1095.47" dur="5.61">class F being a long-range sniper</text>
  <text start="1098.17" dur="4.92">shooting attempted on the president not</text>
  <text start="1101.08" dur="3.54">really sure but I saw those words</text>
  <text start="1103.09" dur="4.17">isolated that way and I thought I would</text>
  <text start="1104.62" dur="5.82">at least point that out but as you can</text>
  <text start="1107.26" dur="5.88">see Q is giving us basically the whole</text>
  <text start="1110.44" dur="5.79">breakdown of how and it looks like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1113.14" dur="6.06">gonna find out exactly who very soon</text>
  <text start="1116.23" dur="5.91">let&amp;#39;s move on post 1808 Q takes us back</text>
  <text start="1119.2" dur="4.05">to June 15th these reporters and</text>
  <text start="1122.14" dur="2.67">networks have been named in the</text>
  <text start="1123.25" dur="4.26">WikiLeaks to have colluded with the DNC</text>
  <text start="1124.81" dur="6.24">or Hillary campaign during the 2016</text>
  <text start="1127.51" dur="6.42">election and as you can see many of our</text>
  <text start="1131.05" dur="4.95">main publications news stations many</text>
  <text start="1133.93" dur="4.68">names implicated here and it looks like</text>
  <text start="1136" dur="6.2">we can basically plug all these names</text>
  <text start="1138.61" dur="8.43">into this graph back here</text>
  <text start="1142.2" dur="7.51">so essentially kids this is what ends up</text>
  <text start="1147.04" dur="5.88">culminating in our four am talking</text>
  <text start="1149.71" dur="6.51">points getting Intel from all these</text>
  <text start="1152.92" dur="7.65">knuckleheads over here to all these</text>
  <text start="1156.22" dur="8.76">mainstream media knuckleheads over here</text>
  <text start="1160.57" dur="9.51">by way of this and all protected up in</text>
  <text start="1164.98" dur="6.87">this cloud post 18:09 Q takes us to this</text>
  <text start="1170.08" dur="3.66">which is a list of sealed indictments</text>
  <text start="1171.85" dur="3.87">thousands upon thousands of indictments</text>
  <text start="1173.74" dur="5.07">we already knew about this q gives us</text>
  <text start="1175.72" dur="5.57">this Twitter link here and that takes us</text>
  <text start="1178.81" dur="5.67">to this storm watch or Twitter</text>
  <text start="1181.29" dur="4.3">just another updated list and if you</text>
  <text start="1184.48" dur="3.36">want to back it up you can go over here</text>
  <text start="1185.59" dur="5.88">to storm watching and it looks like it</text>
  <text start="1187.84" dur="7.61">at da Martin 32 and you can backup your</text>
  <text start="1191.47" dur="6.57">files here so it looks to me like</text>
  <text start="1195.45" dur="4.63">whatever is about to drop it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="1198.04" dur="4.35">show exactly the names that were</text>
  <text start="1200.08" dur="3.75">implicated in those graphs and it looks</text>
  <text start="1202.39" dur="3.69">like it&amp;#39;s gonna come off of this list</text>
  <text start="1203.83" dur="4.12">would not surprise me and this is going</text>
  <text start="1206.08" dur="4.15">to be a very very big deal after</text>
  <text start="1207.95" dur="4.859">all these are the same people that are</text>
  <text start="1210.23" dur="5.49">going after queueing on incredibly hard</text>
  <text start="1212.809" dur="3.901">more so than ever before like I said</text>

  <text start="1808.869" dur="5.73">to kind of read but the thing about this</text>
  <text start="1811.299" dur="4.771">an article in particular in contrast to</text>
  <text start="1814.599" dur="3.42">all the other articles that we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="1816.07" dur="3.75">is that although they do call it a</text>

  <text start="1842.849" dur="4.81">here you go at least they&amp;#39;re presenting</text>

  <text start="1865.42" dur="4.35">nothing to do with it so I would say</text>
  <text start="1867.31" dur="5.28">this is about as deep as Fox was able to</text>
  <text start="1869.77" dur="4.32">go and still look like they were trying</text>
  <text start="1872.59" dur="2.85">to be objective about it and I can at</text>

  <text start="2351.7" dur="4.139">doesn&amp;#39;t mean we have to shut up about</text>
  <text start="2352.809" dur="6.54">cue that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that we have to</text>
  <text start="2355.839" dur="5.43">stay silent by any means but here&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="2359.349" dur="4.77">I would like to suggest when it comes to</text>
  <text start="2361.269" dur="5.961">entering the mainstream media narrative</text>
  <text start="2364.119" dur="6.111">we&amp;#39;ve seen already with this plethora of</text>
  <text start="2367.23" dur="5.95">links that they don&amp;#39;t mean us any</text>
  <text start="2370.23" dur="4.93">fortune do they they want to make sure</text>
  <text start="2373.18" dur="4.429">that they drive this into the ground so</text>
  <text start="2375.16" dur="5.55">what would make us think that going on</text>
  <text start="2377.609" dur="6.94">mainstream media TV right now would be</text>
  <text start="2380.71" dur="4.89">the smartest idea we have to pick our</text>
  <text start="2384.549" dur="3.811">spots</text>
  <text start="2385.6" dur="4.83">and know when to strike and I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="2388.36" dur="7.4">suggesting we just came off a winning</text>
  <text start="2390.43" dur="8.82">round let&amp;#39;s let it all shake out first</text>
  <text start="2395.76" dur="5.17">let&amp;#39;s let POTUS give the green light to</text>
  <text start="2399.25" dur="4.71">the movement and then we&amp;#39;ll move forward</text>
  <text start="2400.93" dur="4.91">now you can take what I&amp;#39;m saying and you</text>
  <text start="2403.96" dur="4.44">can throw it in the trash if you like</text>
  <text start="2405.84" dur="4.96">and I&amp;#39;m gonna pop up my chest for just a</text>
  <text start="2408.4" dur="6.63">minute because I want to let you know</text>
  <text start="2410.8" dur="5.88">that I may not be the greatest QD coder</text>
  <text start="2415.03" dur="3.81">as a matter of fact I know I&amp;#39;m not the</text>
  <text start="2416.68" dur="3.39">greatest QT coder there are some of you</text>
  <text start="2418.84" dur="2.31">that are so brilliant with some of this</text>
  <text start="2420.07" dur="3">stuff and I don&amp;#39;t really think it</text>
  <text start="2421.15" dur="3.72">necessarily matters but where I am</text>
  <text start="2423.07" dur="3.09">speaking from experience is in the</text>
  <text start="2424.87" dur="3">entertainment industry if there&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="2426.16" dur="3.84">thing I know it is the entertainment</text>
  <text start="2427.87" dur="5.67">industry and you can take what I say or</text>
  <text start="2430" dur="6.3">leave it but I will offer to you this it</text>
  <text start="2433.54" dur="5.01">will seem like a welcome opportunity to</text>
  <text start="2436.3" dur="4.62">jump into that interview to get on that</text>
  <text start="2438.55" dur="5.67">show and they&amp;#39;re gonna load you into</text>
  <text start="2440.92" dur="4.65">thinking you&amp;#39;re some kind of VIP and the</text>
  <text start="2444.22" dur="3.15">second the lights are on and that</text>
  <text start="2445.57" dur="4.14">microphones in your face the Jackals</text>
  <text start="2447.37" dur="4.74">will come out and they&amp;#39;re gonna start</text>
  <text start="2449.71" dur="5.04">coming after us that way it&amp;#39;s not gonna</text>
  <text start="2452.11" dur="6.63">just be in print folks and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="2454.75" dur="7.44">it already there will be a time that we</text>
  <text start="2458.74" dur="6.5">can move forward and speak out but I</text>
  <text start="2462.19" dur="6.54">would suggest to you that we hold off</text>
  <text start="2465.24" dur="6.37">see what happens let me put it to you</text>
  <text start="2468.73" dur="5.64">this way let&amp;#39;s start off the season with</text>
  <text start="2471.61" dur="5">a home game let&amp;#39;s not play on their</text>
  <text start="2474.37" dur="4.38">field let&amp;#39;s wait until it&amp;#39;s a home game</text>
  <text start="2476.61" dur="6.04">that way we can have home-field</text>
  <text start="2478.75" dur="5.28">advantage because at this moment we</text>
  <text start="2482.65" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t have a whole lot of structure</text>
  <text start="2484.03" dur="4.62">we&amp;#39;ve got a whole lot of people we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2487.15" dur="3.54">have a whole lot of structure and I</text>
  <text start="2488.65" dur="5.25">think it&amp;#39;s fair to say that now that</text>
  <text start="2490.69" dur="6.75">being said we are artists we are genius</text>
  <text start="2493.9" dur="6.24">we are the elite were the meme makers we</text>
  <text start="2497.44" dur="6.33">know what we&amp;#39;re doing well let&amp;#39;s make</text>
  <text start="2500.14" dur="7.53">our entrance to the main stage a big fat</text>
  <text start="2503.77" dur="5.16">win now I&amp;#39;m keeping a vague some of you</text>
  <text start="2507.67" dur="2.7">may understand what I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="2508.93" dur="3.81">now there was a particular non who</text>
  <text start="2510.37" dur="4.77">emailed me and thank you for turning me</text>
  <text start="2512.74" dur="5.61">on to that content I</text>
  <text start="2515.14" dur="7.26">I handled it I&amp;#39;ve been in direct contact</text>
  <text start="2518.35" dur="7.98">with a few of these major conglomerates</text>
  <text start="2522.4" dur="6.69">and I think it&amp;#39;s important to hold off</text>
  <text start="2526.33" dur="4.23">for the right moment and let&amp;#39;s get the</text>
  <text start="2529.09" dur="3.95">green light first now that&amp;#39;s just what</text>
  <text start="2530.56" dur="5.22">I&amp;#39;m saying you could take it or leave it</text>
  <text start="2533.04" dur="4.63">but I think it would be wise for us to</text>
  <text start="2535.78" dur="4.14">be really really smart about how we</text>
  <text start="2537.67" dur="4.89">enter the topic of conversation because</text>
  <text start="2539.92" dur="5.1">right now mainstream media is not</text>
  <text start="2542.56" dur="4.5">exactly Pro Q are they you&amp;#39;re spending a</text>
  <text start="2545.02" dur="3.87">lot of time to make sure we look like</text>
  <text start="2547.06" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;re getting clowned so don&amp;#39;t think for</text>
  <text start="2548.89" dur="4.98">a second that if you&amp;#39;ve got yourself up</text>
  <text start="2550.87" dur="6.84">interview that those people are gonna be</text>

  <text start="2557.71" dur="3.54">what you got to do at the end of the day</text>
  <text start="2559" dur="5.64">you&amp;#39;ll know what to do but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2561.25" dur="5.06">remember keep our eyes on the prize and</text>
