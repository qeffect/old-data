  <text start="1221.99" dur="3.93">doing this wrong even though camp was</text>
  <text start="1223.82" dur="3.96">this claim is that they did this without</text>
  <text start="1225.92" dur="3.27">a court order so it&amp;#39;s gonna be very</text>
  <text start="1227.78" dur="4.14">interesting to see how this plays out</text>
  <text start="1229.19" dur="4.32">but like I said if this is indeed some</text>
  <text start="1231.92" dur="3">sort of blackmail operation then we</text>
  <text start="1233.51" dur="3.21">could be looking all throughout Europe</text>
  <text start="1234.92" dur="4.77">this was a multi-national</text>
  <text start="1236.72" dur="5.37">operation either way and it looks like</text>
  <text start="1239.69" dur="4.98">drugs were involved we know that from</text>
  <text start="1242.09" dur="4.74">the past so it remains to be seen but if</text>
  <text start="1244.67" dur="4.05">so this could be very very big and I</text>
  <text start="1246.83" dur="3.96">would appreciate it if if you know more</text>
  <text start="1248.72" dur="4.11">about this story please feel free to</text>
  <text start="1250.79" dur="4.29">email me now finally I want to leave you</text>
  <text start="1252.83" dur="4.53">with this I tweeted this yesterday this</text>
  <text start="1255.08" dur="5.43">was from a recent contact excuse me uh</text>
  <text start="1257.36" dur="5.28">from a recent concert and this was from</text>
  <text start="1260.51" dur="3.87">a band called the massive attack and</text>
  <text start="1262.64" dur="3.06">I&amp;#39;ve got you drawing up right here I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1264.38" dur="2.64">just gonna tell you what we see you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1265.7" dur="3.6">the band is playing and they kind of got</text>
  <text start="1267.02" dur="4.32">all this woke stuff going on in the</text>
  <text start="1269.3" dur="3.45">background and where I&amp;#39;ve got it frozen</text>
  <text start="1271.34" dur="3.33">here you can see this sort of the tail</text>
  <text start="1272.75" dur="4.62">and that&amp;#39;s the little see it right there</text>
  <text start="1274.67" dur="4.71">from a queue and they flashed a queue</text>
  <text start="1277.37" dur="2.97">right up there you can see it right next</text>
  <text start="1279.38" dur="3.36">to the who killed</text>
  <text start="1280.34" dur="4.23">Epstein very interesting now they go</text>
  <text start="1282.74" dur="2.79">ahead and proceed and I&amp;#39;m not gonna play</text>
  <text start="1284.57" dur="3.03">the sound because I get hit with</text>
  <text start="1285.53" dur="3.86">copyright probably but um they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1287.6" dur="4.02">talking about all kinds of stuff that</text>
  <text start="1289.39" dur="4.03">essentially was true bet on the crash</text>
  <text start="1291.62" dur="3.57">then made it happen they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="1293.42" dur="3.48">about all these kind of conspiracy</text>
  <text start="1295.19" dur="4.05">theories and whatnot most of them are</text>
  <text start="1296.9" dur="3.96">really really true and of course what I</text>
  <text start="1299.24" dur="3.9">want to point out there it says behind</text>
  <text start="1300.86" dur="3.57">the screen they took your data all true</text>
  <text start="1303.14" dur="2.94">stuff but I want to point out that</text>
  <text start="1304.43" dur="3.69">there&amp;#39;s a lot of flashing lights going</text>
  <text start="1306.08" dur="3.84">on and told how to vote then it goes on</text>
  <text start="1308.12" dur="3.15">to a little thing about President Trump</text>
  <text start="1309.92" dur="2.79">and it&amp;#39;s gonna show a little news clip</text>
  <text start="1311.27" dur="4.89">from this guy right here who&amp;#39;s reporting</text>
  <text start="1312.71" dur="4.95">on Trump and again right in the middle</text>
  <text start="1316.16" dur="2.29">of a concert massive attack is a pretty</text>
  <text start="1317.66" dur="4.03">pretty big</text>
  <text start="1318.45" dur="5.4">and flashing all these different</text>
  <text start="1321.69" dur="3.359">suggestions to you and then it finally</text>
  <text start="1323.85" dur="5.639">finishes by saying maybe all</text>
  <text start="1325.049" dur="5.82">conspiracies are conspiracy and then the</text>
  <text start="1329.489" dur="4.201">next thing right here says to make you</text>
  <text start="1330.869" dur="5.971">feel powerless and then finally it</text>
  <text start="1333.69" dur="5.839">finishes with this last phrase right</text>
  <text start="1336.84" dur="6.029">here which is what I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="1339.529" dur="5.051">there we go suspicion is another form of</text>
  <text start="1342.869" dur="3.66">control so I know a lot of people were</text>
  <text start="1344.58" dur="3.659">passing this around saying that this is</text>
  <text start="1346.529" dur="3.181">a some pretty work stuff and how cool it</text>
  <text start="1348.239" dur="3.3">is to get Qi I don&amp;#39;t really think that</text>
  <text start="1349.71" dur="4.079">that was the whole point that this ban</text>
  <text start="1351.539" dur="3.421">was making here at all and if you go</text>
  <text start="1353.789" dur="2.85">under their website you&amp;#39;ll see what I</text>
  <text start="1354.96" dur="3.959">mean but I&amp;#39;m not gonna make cast in the</text>
  <text start="1356.639" dur="4.201">aspersions on the ban but my point is is</text>
  <text start="1358.919" dur="4.47">that suspicion is not another form of</text>
  <text start="1360.84" dur="5.339">control suspicion is natural if you put</text>
  <text start="1363.389" dur="4.65">a robot dog into a pack of dogs that</text>
  <text start="1366.179" dur="4.95">pack of dogs is going to be suspicious</text>
  <text start="1368.039" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s a natural thing to be suspicious</text>
  <text start="1371.129" dur="3.12">now obviously suspicion can you know</text>
  <text start="1372.989" dur="3.12">overrun you and whatever I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1374.249" dur="3.42">get deep into the theory about it but I</text>
  <text start="1376.109" dur="3.091">think the point is is that even though</text>
  <text start="1377.669" dur="3.57">these guys we&amp;#39;re looking to be woke by</text>
  <text start="1379.2" dur="3.51">flash and cue I found it very odd that</text>
  <text start="1381.239" dur="4.26">they flashed it right next to the</text>
  <text start="1382.71" dur="4.86">Epstein and keep in mind to my control</text>
  <text start="1385.499" dur="4.29">is often used with flashing lights and</text>
  <text start="1387.57" dur="4.439">by using suggestive terms like this so</text>
  <text start="1389.789" dur="3.48">again not casting any aspersions on the</text>
  <text start="1392.009" dur="4.98">band but I don&amp;#39;t think these guys were</text>
  <text start="1393.269" dur="5.25">trying to red peel anybody at all that&amp;#39;s</text>
