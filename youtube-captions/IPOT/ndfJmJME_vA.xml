  <text start="66.03" dur="3.72">cost me some hours of time but I wanted</text>
  <text start="68.19" dur="3.719">to make sure that I got this story out</text>

  <text start="83.43" dur="4.53">eighty six hundred without things</text>
  <text start="85.47" dur="4.95">falling apart US defense secretary Mark</text>
  <text start="87.96" dur="3.99">espera arrived in Afghanistan on Sunday</text>
  <text start="90.42" dur="4.05">in a bid to bring talks with the Taliban</text>
  <text start="91.95" dur="4.13">back on track after President Donald</text>
  <text start="94.47" dur="4.439">Trump abruptly broke off negotiations</text>
  <text start="96.08" dur="5.289">last month seeking to end the United</text>
  <text start="98.909" dur="4.681">States longest war espers trip to Kabul</text>
  <text start="101.369" dur="3.841">comes amid questions about the United</text>
  <text start="103.59" dur="3.389">States commitments to allies after a</text>
  <text start="105.21" dur="3.99">sudden withdrawal of US troops from</text>
  <text start="106.979" dur="4.261">northeastern Syria and Trump&amp;#39;s long</text>
  <text start="109.2" dur="4.02">desire longtime desire excuse me to get</text>
  <text start="111.24" dur="3.72">out of foreign engagements the aim is to</text>
  <text start="113.22" dur="3.84">still get a peace agreement at some</text>
  <text start="114.96" dur="4.53">point a political agreement that is the</text>
  <text start="117.06" dur="4.949">best way forward Esper told reporters</text>
  <text start="119.49" dur="4.56">traveling with him to Afghanistan he is</text>
  <text start="122.009" dur="5.131">due to meet president Ashraf Ghani and</text>
  <text start="124.05" dur="4.65">US troops while in Afghanistan I hope we</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="3.27">can move forward and come up with a</text>
  <text start="128.7" dur="3.33">political agreement that meets our ends</text>
  <text start="130.41" dur="3.78">and meets the goals we want to achieve</text>
  <text start="132.03" dur="4.41">Esper said adding the talks were in the</text>
  <text start="134.19" dur="4.079">State Department&amp;#39;s domain he added that</text>
  <text start="136.44" dur="4.16">the United States could go down to about</text>
  <text start="138.269" dur="4.5">86 hundred troops from the current</text>
  <text start="140.6" dur="4.15">14,000 without affecting</text>
  <text start="142.769" dur="4.021">counterterrorism operations if needed</text>
  <text start="144.75" dur="4.92">okay so that&amp;#39;s a pretty significant</text>
  <text start="146.79" dur="4.89">decrease right there trump halted talks</text>
  <text start="149.67" dur="4.05">with the Taliban aimed at striking a</text>
  <text start="151.68" dur="4.05">deal for US and other foreign troops to</text>
  <text start="153.72" dur="4.17">withdraw in exchange for taliban</text>
  <text start="155.73" dur="4.349">security guarantees after it carried out</text>
  <text start="157.89" dur="5.219">a bomb attack in Kabul last month that</text>
  <text start="160.079" dur="4.951">killed 12 people including a US soldier</text>
  <text start="163.109" dur="4.261">okay so Secretary of Defense and</text>
  <text start="165.03" dur="4.5">remember this guy is a trump appointee I</text>
  <text start="167.37" dur="4.86">want to point out that he was a former</text>
  <text start="169.53" dur="5.1">Raytheon guy and he was also a big-time</text>
  <text start="172.23" dur="3.66">lobbyist but uh like I said it is</text>
  <text start="174.63" dur="3.12">important to know that this was a trump</text>
  <text start="175.89" dur="3.75">appointee this seems to be the official</text>
  <text start="177.75" dur="3.65">visit and I find it very interesting</text>
  <text start="179.64" dur="4.14">that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about Syria</text>
  <text start="181.4" dur="4.959">Turkey and now all of a sudden we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="183.78" dur="4.89">talking again about Afghanistan well it</text>
  <text start="186.359" dur="4.561">turns out our boy espera is not the only</text>
  <text start="188.67" dur="4.8">person in Afghanistan looks like</text>

  <text start="204.72" dur="4.32">following previously unannounced talks</text>
  <text start="206.85" dur="5.43">with King Abdullah in Jordan which was</text>
  <text start="209.04" dur="6.06">also really suspect House Speaker Nancy</text>
  <text start="212.28" dur="5.13">pants Pelosi continued seeking to offer</text>
  <text start="215.1" dur="4.59">a counterpoint to what the Democrats and</text>
  <text start="217.41" dur="4.59">some Republicans in the US Congress view</text>
  <text start="219.69" dur="5.31">as the Trump administration&amp;#39;s chaotic</text>
  <text start="222" dur="5.31">and damaging conduct of foreign policy</text>
  <text start="225" dur="4.38">mrs. Pelosi M comments to Afghan</text>
  <text start="227.31" dur="4.5">reporters at the u.s. embassy said</text>
  <text start="229.38" dur="4.68">America must have a strategic vision for</text>
  <text start="231.81" dur="3.87">Afghanistan a commitment that unlike</text>
  <text start="234.06" dur="3.6">other countries where the u.s. had a</text>
  <text start="235.68" dur="3.39">presence reflected the loss of American</text>
  <text start="237.66" dur="5.03">lives since the american-led invasion</text>
  <text start="239.07" dur="6.21">that al stood the Taliban in 2001 okay</text>
  <text start="242.69" dur="5.86">translation looks like Nancy pants is</text>
  <text start="245.28" dur="5.46">breaking the Logan Act both mrs. Pelosi</text>
  <text start="248.55" dur="4.95">and mr. Esper were set to meet with</text>
  <text start="250.74" dur="4.5">President Ashraf Ghani and US military</text>
  <text start="253.5" dur="3.269">officials but it couldn&amp;#39;t immediately be</text>
  <text start="255.24" dur="3.779">determined whether they would meet each</text>
  <text start="256.769" dur="4.561">other during their brief visits to Kabul</text>
  <text start="259.019" dur="4.171">however both however arrived here amid</text>
  <text start="261.33" dur="4.05">doubts about that trump administration&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="263.19" dur="3.78">commitments to allies after the sudden</text>
  <text start="265.38" dur="4.23">withdrawal of US troops from</text>
  <text start="266.97" dur="4.59">northeastern Syria the visits follow mr.</text>
  <text start="269.61" dur="3.869">Trump&amp;#39;s declaration early in September</text>
  <text start="271.56" dur="4.83">that year long us talks with the Taliban</text>
  <text start="273.479" dur="5.611">on a negotiated settlement of the 18</text>
  <text start="276.39" dur="4.65">year war word dead US and Afghan</text>
  <text start="279.09" dur="3.21">officials have long feared that mr.</text>
  <text start="281.04" dur="3.18">Trump&amp;#39;s aversion to foreign</text>
  <text start="282.3" dur="5.25">entanglements would lead him to order an</text>
  <text start="284.22" dur="5.13">immediate withdrawal of all 14,500</text>
  <text start="287.55" dur="4.17">American military personnel from the</text>
  <text start="289.35" dur="4.71">country especially as next year&amp;#39;s US</text>
  <text start="291.72" dur="4.92">presidential election draws near in his</text>
  <text start="294.06" dur="4.29">comments to reporters mr. Esper appeared</text>
  <text start="296.64" dur="4.14">to suggest that a drawdown in the</text>
  <text start="298.35" dur="4.44">context of a negotiated settlement was</text>
  <text start="300.78" dur="3.72">preferable to a unilateral troop</text>
  <text start="302.79" dur="3.84">withdrawal which former national</text>
  <text start="304.5" dur="4.77">security advisor John Bolton had urged</text>
  <text start="306.63" dur="5.64">okay so this is strange because it</text>
  <text start="309.27" dur="5.34">sounds like Democrats don&amp;#39;t want any any</text>
  <text start="312.27" dur="4.5">troops to leave and of course this mr.</text>
  <text start="314.61" dur="4.559">Esper is sort of proposing that this get</text>
  <text start="316.77" dur="4.709">knocked down to about 80 600 people I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="319.169" dur="4.651">quite surprised at a national that John</text>
  <text start="321.479" dur="4.081">Bolton would have urged any troops</text>
  <text start="323.82" dur="2.96">leaving so that seems very out of</text>
  <text start="325.56" dur="3.2">character for John</text>
  <text start="326.78" dur="3.63">Boulton a peace agreement with the</text>
  <text start="328.76" dur="3.36">Taliban was still the best way forward</text>
  <text start="330.41" dur="3.51">and the administration&amp;#39;s aim was to</text>
  <text start="332.12" dur="4.26">achieve such a deal at some point he</text>
  <text start="333.92" dur="4.62">said since mr. Trump abruptly ended the</text>
  <text start="336.38" dur="4.35">u.s. Taliban talks in September the</text>
  <text start="338.54" dur="4.77">chief American negotiators al Michael</text>
  <text start="340.73" dur="4.8">Assad has remained on the job urging the</text>
  <text start="343.31" dur="4.109">Taliban to take steps to reduce violence</text>
  <text start="345.53" dur="4.26">and seeking to discourage regional</text>
  <text start="347.419" dur="4.261">powers from acting as spoilers while the</text>
  <text start="349.79" dur="4.41">fate in directions of the negotiations</text>
  <text start="351.68" dur="4.5">remain uncertain okay so lots of crazy</text>
  <text start="354.2" dur="4.11">stuff going on I want to just point out</text>
  <text start="356.18" dur="4.89">today a few things that are going on</text>
  <text start="358.31" dur="5.22">recently and how they may interconnect</text>
  <text start="361.07" dur="4.71">and I&amp;#39;ll leave you with that but as we</text>
  <text start="363.53" dur="4.86">know Pelosi was already in Jordan and of</text>
  <text start="365.78" dur="4.92">course that was already suspicious</text>
  <text start="368.39" dur="4.35">now she was meeting with top Jordanian</text>
  <text start="370.7" dur="4.11">officials so we don&amp;#39;t really know</text>
  <text start="372.74" dur="4.95">exactly who we just know they were top</text>
  <text start="374.81" dur="4.68">Jordanian officials and according to the</text>
  <text start="377.69" dur="3.96">hill what they were talking about of</text>
  <text start="379.49" dur="4.26">course was a stability in the region but</text>
  <text start="381.65" dur="4.43">particularly I wanted to point out they</text>
  <text start="383.75" dur="4.41">were talking about increased flow of</text>
  <text start="386.08" dur="4.51">immigrants and so I think that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="388.16" dur="4.92">what this comes down to but it also</text>
  <text start="390.59" dur="6.18">comes down to money and really both kind</text>
  <text start="393.08" dur="6.72">of go hand-in-hand right so I want to</text>
  <text start="396.77" dur="6.57">mention that this ashraf ghani who is</text>
  <text start="399.8" dur="6.239">president of Afghanistan I would imagine</text>
  <text start="403.34" dur="4.35">that we have basically a couple</text>
  <text start="406.039" dur="2.791">different factions here and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="407.69" dur="3.45">playing a little bit of a game of</text>
  <text start="408.83" dur="5.19">he-said she-said so first of all we have</text>
  <text start="411.14" dur="4.38">Esper who is already proposing some sort</text>
  <text start="414.02" dur="4.38">of looks to be in the middle of</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="4.97">compromise of just scaling back troops</text>
  <text start="418.4" dur="4.62">as opposed to just yanking them all out</text>
  <text start="420.49" dur="4.36">which of course would create a PR</text>
  <text start="423.02" dur="4.23">nightmare even if it were the right</text>
  <text start="424.85" dur="3.6">thing to do I&amp;#39;m not so sure if it is the</text>
  <text start="427.25" dur="3.21">right thing to do or not I&amp;#39;m not an</text>
  <text start="428.45" dur="3.779">expert but either way I think we all</text>
  <text start="430.46" dur="3.36">know if you just yanked him all out it</text>
  <text start="432.229" dur="3.271">would be a PR nightmare and I think it</text>
  <text start="433.82" dur="3.719">would be pretty impossible to defend</text>
  <text start="435.5" dur="4.38">even if it were correct</text>
  <text start="437.539" dur="4.471">so here we have this kind of deal going</text>
  <text start="439.88" dur="4.38">on but then we&amp;#39;ve got like I said he</text>
  <text start="442.01" dur="4.08">said she said thing going on where Nancy</text>
  <text start="444.26" dur="3.63">Pelosi is following up we saw a very</text>
  <text start="446.09" dur="3.72">similar similar thing one time with</text>
  <text start="447.89" dur="3.99">Obama and President Trump he was sort of</text>
  <text start="449.81" dur="3.51">following up - right that&amp;#39;s what this</text>
  <text start="451.88" dur="3.51">looks like to me but I have a feeling</text>
  <text start="453.32" dur="4.83">that we&amp;#39;re going after money after all</text>
  <text start="455.39" dur="4.619">ashraf ghani before that he was</text>
  <text start="458.15" dur="4.169">president he was a fighting</text>
  <text start="460.009" dur="5.15">minister and he was actually brought in</text>
  <text start="462.319" dur="5.16">as president to kind of help recover</text>
  <text start="465.159" dur="4.03">afghanistan after the fall of the</text>
  <text start="467.479" dur="4.11">Taliban government that was a whole</text>
  <text start="469.189" dur="4.801">point and I don&amp;#39;t really know that</text>
  <text start="471.589" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;ve had much economic recovery if at</text>
  <text start="473.99" dur="4.799">all there but it would have it would</text>
  <text start="476.599" dur="5.55">seem to me that this is a hit up for</text>
  <text start="478.789" dur="6.511">money at least in one aspect so like I</text>
  <text start="482.149" dur="4.8">said President now finance minister</text>
  <text start="485.3" dur="6.269">previously but he&amp;#39;s also done a ton of</text>
  <text start="486.949" dur="8.101">work with the World Bank and in also</text>
  <text start="491.569" dur="5.28">with the UN in regards to this forgive</text>
  <text start="495.05" dur="4.229">me I won&amp;#39;t quite get the name right but</text>
  <text start="496.849" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s like a legal empowerment fund it</text>
  <text start="499.279" dur="3.301">reminds me a little bit of our we call</text>
  <text start="501.169" dur="3.691">it kids in need of defense here in the</text>
  <text start="502.58" dur="3.389">United States it&amp;#39;s this organization it</text>
  <text start="504.86" dur="3.089">kind of helps get people legal</text>
  <text start="505.969" dur="4.051">representation for poor people illegal</text>
  <text start="507.949" dur="4.71">immigrants and things like that in the</text>
  <text start="510.02" dur="5.459">United States kind is represented that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="512.659" dur="4.62">uh Bill Gates and Angelina Jolie but</text>
  <text start="515.479" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s a kind of a similar thing I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="517.279" dur="5.161">complaining the two here I just want you</text>
  <text start="518.899" dur="5.25">to know that he obviously is pro</text>
  <text start="522.44" dur="3.269">immigrant and of course like I just said</text>
  <text start="524.149" dur="5.821">they were talking about the flow of</text>
  <text start="525.709" dur="5.851">immigrants in Jordan so a lot of money</text>
  <text start="529.97" dur="4.349">looks like they&amp;#39;re wanting to make sure</text>
  <text start="531.56" dur="4.2">that these borders stay open and it</text>
  <text start="534.319" dur="2.971">wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise me if they&amp;#39;re checking</text>
  <text start="535.76" dur="3.449">on those poppy fields out there in</text>
  <text start="537.29" dur="4.26">Afghanistan now a couple more quick</text>
  <text start="539.209" dur="5.731">things about Ashraf Ghani he attended</text>
  <text start="541.55" dur="5.789">Columbia he also taught at Berkeley and</text>
  <text start="544.94" dur="3.99">he also attended Stanford Business</text>
  <text start="547.339" dur="4.351">School this is kind of weird it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="548.93" dur="5.219">harvard program sponsored by the world</text>
  <text start="551.69" dur="5.43">bank but it&amp;#39;s at Stanford Graduate</text>
  <text start="554.149" dur="5.971">Business School so this guy&amp;#39;s got all</text>
  <text start="557.12" dur="5.49">the makings of a clown knucklehead but</text>
  <text start="560.12" dur="4.649">again finance minister and now president</text>
  <text start="562.61" dur="3.99">of course he&amp;#39;s hooking up with Pelosi</text>
  <text start="564.769" dur="5.82">looks like he&amp;#39;s hooking up with both</text>
  <text start="566.6" dur="5.46">Pelosi and Esper this week but one more</text>
  <text start="570.589" dur="4.381">thing I want to point out about Ghani</text>
  <text start="572.06" dur="5.519">just earlier this year it was his own</text>
  <text start="574.97" dur="6.78">general his security adviser Habib Ulla</text>
  <text start="577.579" dur="6.45">Ahmad ah he accused him of running kind</text>
  <text start="581.75" dur="5.25">of this how shall I say kind of a sex</text>
  <text start="584.029" dur="4.591">ring I guess but it was within his own</text>
  <text start="587" dur="3.84">you know Parliament basically anybody</text>
  <text start="588.62" dur="4.83">who was sleeping with whomever</text>
  <text start="590.84" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re getting elected positions and so</text>
  <text start="593.45" dur="3.36">this was a pretty big mess by his own</text>
  <text start="595.13" dur="4.35">security adviser and like I said this</text>
  <text start="596.81" dur="4.89">was just months ago so just to give you</text>
  <text start="599.48" dur="4.8">an idea of who Pelosi and Esper are</text>

  <text start="621.17" dur="5.49">northern Mexico where we have all this</text>

  <text start="638.5" dur="4.09">2015</text>
  <text start="639.74" dur="4.32">later got extradited again in 2017 if</text>
  <text start="642.59" dur="4.29">you guys remember he was I believe at</text>
  <text start="644.06" dur="5.52">MCC where Jeffrey Epstein that whole</text>
  <text start="646.88" dur="4.44">episode that whole episode went down he</text>
  <text start="649.58" dur="3.09">was later transferred out I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="651.32" dur="4.65">if they were there at the same time or</text>
  <text start="652.67" dur="5.19">not but this was over a routine stop</text>
  <text start="655.97" dur="4.05">where they actually caught a video El</text>
  <text start="657.86" dur="4.11">Chapo&amp;#39;s son and then of course this</text>
  <text start="660.02" dur="3.39">sparked heavy heavy fire and if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="661.97" dur="3.93">not familiar with the Sinaloa cartel</text>
  <text start="663.41" dur="5.7">down there they&amp;#39;re massive and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="665.9" dur="5.82">just as well armed as their military</text>
  <text start="669.11" dur="5.04">this is an incredibly complex story too</text>
  <text start="671.72" dur="4.98">I don&amp;#39;t completely understand it but</text>
  <text start="674.15" dur="4.14">even amongst the Sinaloa cartel there is</text>
  <text start="676.7" dur="3.72">a lot of fighting for power there too</text>
  <text start="678.29" dur="4.92">especially in the absence of El Chapo</text>
  <text start="680.42" dur="4.14">but this involves multiple families</text>
  <text start="683.21" dur="2.76">there&amp;#39;s a ton of different gangster</text>
  <text start="684.56" dur="4.5">families down there fighting for control</text>
  <text start="685.97" dur="6.42">but particularly this seems to be</text>
  <text start="689.06" dur="4.8">between security forces and the Sinaloa</text>
  <text start="692.39" dur="2.88">cartel and of course this is a very</text>
  <text start="693.86" dur="3.84">dangerous people are already starting to</text>
  <text start="695.27" dur="3.54">die so why are we talking about this</text>
  <text start="697.7" dur="4.95">stuff right here</text>
  <text start="698.81" dur="6.89">well because El Chapo was likely a heavy</text>
  <text start="702.65" dur="6.54">funder of some Democrats in particular</text>
  <text start="705.7" dur="5.08">people like Nancy Pelosi oddly enough we</text>
  <text start="709.19" dur="4.26">were just talking about Nancy Pelosi</text>
  <text start="710.78" dur="4.56">right now it was supposed it was</text>

  <text start="715.34" dur="5.55">that he had given millions to Democrats</text>

  <text start="720.89" dur="3.48">being kind of disputed saying that</text>
  <text start="722.69" dur="2.16">wasn&amp;#39;t true or whatnot but it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="724.37" dur="2.37">long</text>
  <text start="724.85" dur="4.109">expected it shouldn&amp;#39;t surprise us right</text>
  <text start="726.74" dur="4.589">let&amp;#39;s remember that Nancy Pelosi is</text>
  <text start="728.959" dur="4.291">actually Nancy D&amp;#39;Allesandro on that is</text>
  <text start="731.329" dur="3.661">also a long time</text>

  <text start="1210.4" dur="4.77">an Tifa you&amp;#39;re always going to have</text>
  <text start="1212.53" dur="4.95">these leaders that might very well adapt</text>
  <text start="1215.17" dur="4.56">to these political beliefs or spiritual</text>
  <text start="1217.48" dur="4.35">beliefs or whatnot that might affect the</text>
  <text start="1219.73" dur="4.11">region but then oftentimes these guys</text>
  <text start="1221.83" dur="4.71">are kind of pumped full of just funded</text>
  <text start="1223.84" dur="4.8">mercenaries and you know Q&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="1226.54" dur="3.74">implied this that ms-13 is really no</text>
  <text start="1228.64" dur="4.23">different than a group like Isis</text>
  <text start="1230.28" dur="4.69">obviously they outwardly have these you</text>
  <text start="1232.87" dur="4.29">know different views or whatnot but</text>
  <text start="1234.97" dur="3.6">overall they&amp;#39;re worldwide terrorists</text>
  <text start="1237.16" dur="3.75">right and they&amp;#39;ve always been kind of</text>
  <text start="1238.57" dur="3.78">sponsored in different places so here</text>
  <text start="1240.91" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;ve got all this fighting going on</text>
  <text start="1242.35" dur="3.84">down at the Mexican border and we know</text>
  <text start="1244.81" dur="3.96">that some of that money was going to</text>
  <text start="1246.19" dur="5.13">Democrats and I&amp;#39;d be really curious to</text>
  <text start="1248.77" dur="5.43">see how much the wall is affecting that</text>
  <text start="1251.32" dur="4.23">in this point in time because it seems</text>
  <text start="1254.2" dur="3.45">to be creating a bit of pain</text>
  <text start="1255.55" dur="3.33">now Mexico&amp;#39;s got their own issues and</text>
  <text start="1257.65" dur="3.3">like I said it&amp;#39;s a little bit more</text>
  <text start="1258.88" dur="3.45">complicated than that but I do find it</text>
  <text start="1260.95" dur="3.78">very interesting that there&amp;#39;s sort of a</text>
  <text start="1262.33" dur="5.46">panic run and they were going after El</text>
  <text start="1264.73" dur="5.01">Chapo and El Chapo&amp;#39;s son so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1267.79" dur="4.71">lot of power being taken down there</text>
  <text start="1269.74" dur="4.44">yet there&amp;#39;s still a really really crazy</text>
  <text start="1272.5" dur="3.69">situation because like I said the</text>
  <text start="1274.18" dur="5.04">cartels are almost as powerful as the</text>
  <text start="1276.19" dur="4.68">military at that point but for the</text>
  <text start="1279.22" dur="4.23">Sinaloa cartel&amp;#39;s who have been there for</text>
  <text start="1280.87" dur="5.73">decades as well for them to fight like</text>
  <text start="1283.45" dur="5.37">this out in the open this way as opposed</text>
  <text start="1286.6" dur="4.77">to how they&amp;#39;ve been doing from Alaska or</text>
  <text start="1288.82" dur="3.75">even a decade or so suggest that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1291.37" dur="2.88">something that they&amp;#39;re really going</text>
  <text start="1292.57" dur="3.42">after or something&amp;#39;s been cut off or</text>
  <text start="1294.25" dur="3.51">there&amp;#39;s some sort of panic but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1295.99" dur="3.54">got to be some sort of reason here for</text>
  <text start="1297.76" dur="3.66">the escalated fighting is it just</text>
  <text start="1299.53" dur="4.47">because they went after El Chapo son</text>
  <text start="1301.42" dur="4.62">could be but I just showed you some</text>
  <text start="1304" dur="4.26">connections in where some of that money</text>
  <text start="1306.04" dur="4.86">is going to Democrats particularly open</text>
  <text start="1308.26" dur="5.73">border Democrats and I mentioned that I</text>
  <text start="1310.9" dur="5.16">would mention Beto al Roarke again</text>
  <text start="1313.99" dur="5.1">of course this guy looks to be on the</text>
  <text start="1316.06" dur="3.72">take to remember he was offering some of</text>
  <text start="1319.09" dur="3.18">his own</text>
  <text start="1319.78" dur="3.57">you know money to help some of these you</text>
  <text start="1322.27" dur="2.4">know he went down to the border you</text>
  <text start="1323.35" dur="3.48">staged this little thing and it was</text>
  <text start="1324.67" dur="3.87">essentially illegal but he was helping</text>
  <text start="1326.83" dur="3.45">people get across the border well we see</text>
  <text start="1328.54" dur="3.48">getting that money from is this guy so</text>
  <text start="1330.28" dur="3.81">well funded that he&amp;#39;s just doing it out</text>
  <text start="1332.02" dur="3.3">of the goodness of his heart well I just</text>
  <text start="1334.09" dur="4.59">showed you the picture they&amp;#39;re down in</text>
  <text start="1335.32" dur="5.61">Mexico it wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise us all if a</text>
  <text start="1338.68" dur="4.83">guy like that was also on the take maybe</text>
  <text start="1340.93" dur="4.41">from this Glen maybe from El Chapo</text>
  <text start="1343.51" dur="3.39">himself not really sure but I would</text>
  <text start="1345.34" dur="4.26">imagine better was on the take because I</text>
  <text start="1346.9" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t imagine he&amp;#39;s got the kind of coin</text>
  <text start="1349.6" dur="3.54">on his own to go down there on the</text>
  <text start="1351.4" dur="4.86">border and pull a stunt like that like</text>
  <text start="1353.14" dur="4.38">he did earlier in the year right so we</text>
  <text start="1356.26" dur="2.7">see these connections we see the</text>
  <text start="1357.52" dur="3.18">connections with Adam Schiff Hillary</text>
  <text start="1358.96" dur="3.3">Clinton Nancy Pelosi and of course all</text>
  <text start="1360.7" dur="4.38">these people are in a panic right now</text>
  <text start="1362.26" dur="4.98">now we see Nancy Pelosi go out there to</text>
  <text start="1365.08" dur="4.8">Afghanistan just as we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="1367.24" dur="4.14">Syria mmm she wants to all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="1369.88" dur="4.05">she&amp;#39;s really really interested in</text>
  <text start="1371.38" dur="4.08">stabilizing the region right and of</text>
  <text start="1373.93" dur="2.82">course I when she was in Jordan what was</text>
  <text start="1375.46" dur="3.03">she talking about she was talking about</text>
  <text start="1376.75" dur="3.09">it in flux of what she called refugees</text>
  <text start="1378.49" dur="3.42">but let&amp;#39;s call them what they are they</text>
  <text start="1379.84" dur="3.3">were immigrants right we&amp;#39;re illegals or</text>
  <text start="1381.91" dur="2.82">illegal migration or whatever you want</text>
  <text start="1383.14" dur="2.97">to call it but it&amp;#39;s the movement of</text>
  <text start="1384.73" dur="3.63">people it&amp;#39;s the movement of drugs it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1386.11" dur="3">the movement of money this is very much</text>
  <text start="1388.36" dur="2.01">how</text>
  <text start="1389.11" dur="3.24">these people are gettting whether it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1390.37" dur="4.41">Sinaloa cartel&amp;#39;s whether it&amp;#39;s somebody</text>
  <text start="1392.35" dur="4.709">like this Goulet these are people that</text>
  <text start="1394.78" dur="3.96">all tend to you know tie back to the</text>
  <text start="1397.059" dur="4.531">same kind of whether it&amp;#39;s the United</text>
  <text start="1398.74" dur="5.28">Nations or things like this or these</text>
  <text start="1401.59" dur="4.35">legal foundations like kind or something</text>
  <text start="1404.02" dur="4.71">like this where you know legal defense</text>
  <text start="1405.94" dur="4.53">foundations there&amp;#39;s a lot of money in</text>
  <text start="1408.73" dur="3.12">moving people at the border because of</text>
  <text start="1410.47" dur="3.27">course you move drugs it&amp;#39;s human</text>
  <text start="1411.85" dur="3.66">trafficking it&amp;#39;s where everything kind</text>
  <text start="1413.74" dur="4.47">of comes down and it doesn&amp;#39;t just affect</text>
  <text start="1415.51" dur="4.86">our border of Mexico it affects the</text>
  <text start="1418.21" dur="4.8">borders out there and that is exactly</text>
  <text start="1420.37" dur="4.95">why I would imagine that Nancy Pelosi is</text>
  <text start="1423.01" dur="4.98">all sudden so worried about stability in</text>
  <text start="1425.32" dur="4.14">the region after all let&amp;#39;s not forget</text>
