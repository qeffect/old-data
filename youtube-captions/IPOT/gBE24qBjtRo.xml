  <text start="225.489" dur="4.321">supposed to be used to help low-income</text>
  <text start="227.35" dur="4.26">women and men receive birth control</text>
  <text start="229.81" dur="4.11">cancer screenings and other health care</text>
  <text start="231.61" dur="4.32">services while the tax money cannot be</text>
  <text start="233.92" dur="5.13">used to pay for abortions it indirectly</text>
  <text start="235.93" dur="5.64">funds Planned Parenthood&amp;#39;s vast abortion</text>
  <text start="239.05" dur="5.43">business okay so we talked about this</text>
  <text start="241.57" dur="4.53">some months too and of course the full</text>
  <text start="244.48" dur="3.03">ninth Court Circuit Court of Appeals</text>
  <text start="246.1" dur="3.389">then blocked the defunding while</text>
  <text start="247.51" dur="4.35">considering the case further that was</text>
  <text start="249.489" dur="5.491">the last that we had heard today the</text>
  <text start="251.86" dur="4.98">entire appeals court upheld defunding in</text>
  <text start="254.98" dur="4.259">a 7 to 4 decision with Republican</text>
  <text start="256.84" dur="4.8">appointed judges upholding defended and</text>
  <text start="259.239" dur="4.411">Democrat judges forcing Americans to</text>
  <text start="261.64" dur="3.42">fund the abortion business and if you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="263.65" dur="2.7">remember we&amp;#39;ve talked about this not</text>
  <text start="265.06" dur="3.3">just queue but we&amp;#39;ve talked about this</text>
  <text start="266.35" dur="4.8">quite a bit the importance of having</text>
  <text start="268.36" dur="4.32">those judges winning the Senate so that</text>
  <text start="271.15" dur="3.84">you could appoint those judges and this</text>
  <text start="272.68" dur="4.59">is why it was so important the decision</text>
  <text start="274.99" dur="4.62">drew condemnation from Liana Winn Liana</text>
  <text start="277.27" dur="4.44">Wang Wang weighing the CEO of the</text>
  <text start="279.61" dur="3.6">bortion giant so let me get down to the</text>
  <text start="281.71" dur="2.73">meat of this because we did talk about</text>
  <text start="283.21" dur="3.389">this and there&amp;#39;s a Porton part that I</text>
  <text start="284.44" dur="4.02">kind of want to talk about here last May</text>
  <text start="286.599" dur="3.6">the Trump administration published an</text>
  <text start="288.46" dur="3.87">new proposal for title 10 that would</text>
  <text start="290.199" dur="4.381">prohibit Planned Parenthood and other</text>
  <text start="292.33" dur="4.32">abortion businesses from receiving any</text>
  <text start="294.58" dur="3.959">of those tax dollars unless they</text>
  <text start="296.65" dur="3.78">completely separate their abortion</text>
  <text start="298.539" dur="4.081">businesses from their taxpayer-funded</text>
  <text start="300.43" dur="4.139">services and I want to point out that I</text>
  <text start="302.62" dur="3.51">think the last time we talked about this</text>
  <text start="304.569" dur="3.331">they don&amp;#39;t just mean that figuratively</text>
  <text start="306.13" dur="5.25">naming that literally some of these</text>
  <text start="307.9" dur="6.72">abortion clinics are literally built</text>
  <text start="311.38" dur="4.98">right next door from the services you</text>
  <text start="314.62" dur="4.049">know the offices that we actually fund</text>
  <text start="316.36" dur="4.92">them for and so they have to physically</text>
  <text start="318.669" dur="5.241">separate those offices so not only does</text>
  <text start="321.28" dur="4.8">it help with this title 10 funding and</text>
  <text start="323.91" dur="4.93">basically takes away a lot of money from</text>
  <text start="326.08" dur="4.29">them but I think also for people who are</text>
  <text start="328.84" dur="3.329">maybe getting counseled they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="330.37" dur="3.69">Planned Parenthood and they&amp;#39;re thinking</text>
  <text start="332.169" dur="3.78">about getting an abortion rather than</text>
  <text start="334.06" dur="3.6">being able to just convenient kind of</text>
  <text start="335.949" dur="3.571">sign the papers or whatever they do and</text>
  <text start="337.66" dur="3.39">go right next door to have it done they</text>
  <text start="339.52" dur="3.329">actually have to go to a separate place</text>
  <text start="341.05" dur="3.299">which oftentimes gives them more time to</text>
  <text start="342.849" dur="2.88">think about it I don&amp;#39;t if I makes any</text>
  <text start="344.349" dur="3.841">sense or not but I think that&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="345.729" dur="3.961">big win that means housing their family</text>
  <text start="348.19" dur="3.06">planning services in separate buildings</text>
  <text start="349.69" dur="3.18">out there you go with separate staff</text>
  <text start="351.25" dur="3.63">from their abortion businesses and a</text>
  <text start="352.87" dur="3.78">denial of funds if they fail to do so I</text>
  <text start="354.88" dur="4.02">guess I should have read my own article</text>
  <text start="356.65" dur="4.859">most Planned Parenthood entities are not</text>
  <text start="358.9" dur="5.1">expected to comply yeah imagine that</text>
  <text start="361.509" dur="3.811">yeah that&amp;#39;s probably not gonna go well</text>
  <text start="364" dur="4.199">so this is gonna be ugly but this is a</text>
  <text start="365.32" dur="4.23">big big win from the boss right there</text>
  <text start="368.199" dur="2.761">that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s saying right there his</text>
  <text start="369.55" dur="5.429">face is there I want to take away your</text>
  <text start="370.96" dur="6.36">funding yep let&amp;#39;s move on post 34:16 30</text>
