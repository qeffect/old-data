  <text start="192.489" dur="3.841">you&amp;#39;ve heard about this but I thought it</text>

  <text start="196.33" dur="3.06">here we&amp;#39;re talking about donkeys and of</text>
  <text start="198.1" dur="2.88">course when we think about donkeys we</text>
  <text start="199.39" dur="3.599">think about Democrats we think about</text>

  <text start="208.239" dur="5.22">really know if this was some sort of</text>
  <text start="209.86" dur="5.64">just random story talking about donkeys</text>
  <text start="213.459" dur="4.891">but it perked kind of piqued my interest</text>
  <text start="215.5" dur="4.709">right and you know here was the story</text>
  <text start="218.35" dur="3.87">about these burros and then I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="220.209" dur="4.201">really hear much about it again maybe</text>
  <text start="222.22" dur="4.47">they nabbed the suspect maybe it was</text>
  <text start="224.41" dur="4.44">nothing at all right fair enough so when</text>
  <text start="226.69" dur="3.96">AM who had got their story from CNN</text>
  <text start="228.85" dur="3.72">posted this story about forty two</text>
  <text start="230.65" dur="3.42">donkeys getting shot sounds pretty</text>
  <text start="232.57" dur="3.66">terrible on the surface and maybe</text>
  <text start="234.07" dur="3.63">there&amp;#39;s nothing more to it I&amp;#39;m perfectly</text>
  <text start="236.23" dur="3.75">happy to accept that and that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="237.7" dur="5.1">did I sort of just left it alone</text>
  <text start="239.98" dur="4.92">that was until that fateful day which</text>
  <text start="242.8" dur="3.93">was just essentially the other day CNN</text>
  <text start="244.9" dur="4.2">posts another video this one right here</text>
  <text start="246.73" dur="5.49">this nonprofit has rescued thousands of</text>
  <text start="249.1" dur="4.14">donkeys and burros and the video itself</text>
  <text start="252.22" dur="2.49">doesn&amp;#39;t seem very enough</text>
  <text start="253.24" dur="2.82">various this guy doesn&amp;#39;t seem to fairies</text>
  <text start="254.71" dur="3.48">or anything like that&amp;#39;s a story about</text>
  <text start="256.06" dur="3.39">this guy who rescues these little pygmy</text>
  <text start="258.19" dur="3.68">ponies and they&amp;#39;re pretty sweet-looking</text>
  <text start="259.45" dur="5.28">who wouldn&amp;#39;t want a pygmy Pony right but</text>
  <text start="261.87" dur="5.26">I just found it very very interesting</text>
  <text start="264.73" dur="4.68">that CNN was running a couple stories in</text>
  <text start="267.13" dur="4.2">regards to these donkeys there had been</text>
  <text start="269.41" dur="3.78">previously these forty two donkeys being</text>
  <text start="271.33" dur="3.81">shot and now they&amp;#39;re trying to rescue</text>
  <text start="273.19" dur="4.02">the donkeys is there a little theme here</text>
  <text start="275.14" dur="3.66">or am I just going a little bit nuts</text>

  <text start="281.5" dur="3.06">alright so let&amp;#39;s back away from the</text>
  <text start="283.03" dur="3.15">donkeys for just a minute because I</text>
  <text start="284.56" dur="3.48">realized it might be something but it</text>
  <text start="286.18" dur="3.48">also might be nothing I just want to</text>
  <text start="288.04" dur="2.94">plant the seed what I do want to talk</text>

  <text start="305.2" dur="3.72">this thread it&amp;#39;ll be a lot of relevant</text>
  <text start="307.18" dur="4.08">information but we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="308.92" dur="4.62">the storm dorian we were talking about</text>

  <text start="329.41" dur="3.78">how do you nuke a country without them</text>
  <text start="330.88" dur="4.53">knowing they were noot if a cat5</text>
  <text start="333.19" dur="4.68">hurricane hit a nuclear plant dead</text>
  <text start="335.41" dur="5.1">center and at the exact same time an</text>
  <text start="337.87" dur="4.86">underwater nuke was set off next to it</text>
  <text start="340.51" dur="4.38">would the resulting nuclear meltdown</text>
  <text start="342.73" dur="4.23">look like a Chernobyl Fukushima incident</text>
  <text start="344.89" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s a pretty good question in three</text>
  <text start="346.96" dur="5.57">days three nights&amp;#39; references this post</text>
  <text start="349.24" dur="7.53">right here 1448 from June 10th 2018</text>

  <text start="359.89" dur="3.86">maintain situational awareness alright</text>
  <text start="362.68" dur="4.26">fair enough</text>
  <text start="363.75" dur="5.35">did CNN knowingly scheduled the timing</text>
  <text start="366.94" dur="4.83">of it&amp;#39;s Wednesday the 4th climate crisis</text>
  <text start="369.1" dur="4.68">Town Hall to coincide exactly with the</text>

  <text start="377.38" dur="4.38">nuclear plant ok well that&amp;#39;s a lot to</text>
  <text start="379.84" dur="3.99">chew on right there right first of all</text>
  <text start="381.76" dur="3.36">we would have to assume that humans</text>
  <text start="383.83" dur="2.55">would be possible that kind of you know</text>
  <text start="385.12" dur="1.51">that it would be possible for humans to</text>
  <text start="386.38" dur="2.5">commit</text>
  <text start="386.63" dur="3.72">that kind of behavior I do want to point</text>
  <text start="388.88" dur="3.54">out if you guys remember the Jessie</text>
  <text start="390.35" dur="4.79">small incident in which she was found</text>
  <text start="392.42" dur="5.1">with a noose around his neck was oddly</text>

  <text start="403.85" dur="4.05">politicians do this all the time now</text>
  <text start="406.46" dur="3.99">would this be dealing with a nuclear</text>
  <text start="407.9" dur="4.35">meltdown that&amp;#39;s a pretty big big thing</text>
  <text start="410.45" dur="3.72">but three days three nights&amp;#39; offers some</text>
  <text start="412.25" dur="4.41">pretty compelling information here but</text>
  <text start="414.17" dur="5.01">they did have this climate crisis Town</text>
  <text start="416.66" dur="4.26">Hall and of course it was just a</text>
  <text start="419.18" dur="3.09">carnival of errors right so is it</text>
  <text start="420.92" dur="3.51">possible that they might have expected</text>
  <text start="422.27" dur="4.35">something not really sure but I think</text>
  <text start="424.43" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;re gonna find out did you know that</text>
  <text start="426.62" dur="4.62">on Sunday the 25th that would be last</text>
  <text start="428.99" dur="3.93">month all the early earlier Dorian storm</text>

  <text start="435.17" dur="5.52">the port st. Lucie and then it&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="437.54" dur="6.24">loosie loosie nuclear plant PSL dead</text>
  <text start="440.69" dur="4.41">center as a major hurricane yes and we</text>
  <text start="443.78" dur="3.54">knew this we knew that that was the</text>
  <text start="445.1" dur="4.32">projection and we weren&amp;#39;t really exactly</text>
  <text start="447.32" dur="4.35">sure where it was gonna hit right what</text>
  <text start="449.42" dur="4.71">are the odds that on the Sunday the 25th</text>
  <text start="451.67" dur="5.01">while Dorian was a small storm that the</text>
  <text start="454.13" dur="5.28">MSM would leak a story that Trump said</text>
  <text start="456.68" dur="5.31">he would nuke a hurricane to stop it</text>
  <text start="459.41" dur="4.74">from hitting the US did Trump&amp;#39;s NSA have</text>
  <text start="461.99" dur="4.44">Intel that they were planning a false</text>
  <text start="464.15" dur="4.29">flag weather event well we do know that</text>
  <text start="466.43" dur="4.02">he was he kind of made this offhand</text>
  <text start="468.44" dur="2.52">reference right and of course Trump does</text>
  <text start="470.45" dur="3.21">that a lot</text>
  <text start="470.96" dur="4.71">and then the media takes it and they run</text>
  <text start="473.66" dur="3.96">with it and I usually think this is a</text>
  <text start="475.67" dur="4.8">very very clever because outwardly</text>
  <text start="477.62" dur="4.83">obviously POTUS is perfectly happy look</text>
  <text start="480.47" dur="3.87">stupid about referencing these things he</text>
  <text start="482.45" dur="3.66">doesn&amp;#39;t really care about the backlash</text>
  <text start="484.34" dur="3.66">that it gets but the point is is that</text>
  <text start="486.11" dur="4.98">people are talking about it and if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="488" dur="4.56">a future proves past for them then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="491.09" dur="2.88">probably worth it he could kind of</text>
  <text start="492.56" dur="3.24">remind people we&amp;#39;ll remember when you</text>
  <text start="493.97" dur="4.2">were clowning me about this this is all</text>
  <text start="495.8" dur="4.2">stuff he may have a last laugh on but we</text>
  <text start="498.17" dur="5.22">do know that he said it it was very very</text>
  <text start="500" dur="4.73">odd and even Hillary Clinton piped in</text>
  <text start="503.39" dur="4.38">with that which I thought was very</text>
  <text start="504.73" dur="5.38">interesting Dorian was growing larger</text>
  <text start="507.77" dur="4.2">and on Tuesday the 27th would you be</text>
  <text start="510.11" dur="3.54">surprised to learn that CNN released the</text>

  <text start="526.389" dur="2.731">seems like maybe they were kind of</text>
  <text start="527.769" dur="3.06">waiting for something to happen and of</text>
