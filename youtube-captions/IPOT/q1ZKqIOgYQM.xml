  <text start="38.289" dur="4.871">welcome to the truth this is your host</text>
  <text start="40.699" dur="5.401">Sir Patrick Mak boys and girls strap on</text>
  <text start="43.16" dur="17.31">your Bible belts I guess today&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="46.1" dur="16.47">be biblical I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="60.47" dur="4.11">be all that intense might want to dial</text>
  <text start="62.57" dur="5">that back just a little bit John John</text>
  <text start="64.58" dur="6.06">how many q posts are in front of thee</text>
  <text start="67.57" dur="5.799">yes sir 35 51 is where we last left you</text>
  <text start="70.64" dur="4.53">23 minutes out to be our 12 keys talking</text>
  <text start="73.369" dur="4.11">about voter ID not the first time not</text>
  <text start="75.17" dur="5.13">the last time meaning how many times our</text>
  <text start="77.479" dur="4.741">elections have been rigged reread pastor</text>
  <text start="80.3" dur="3.929">ops regarding voter ID okay well we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="82.22" dur="3.36">got a ton of Q posts in front of us so</text>
  <text start="84.229" dur="3.361">I&amp;#39;m not interested in digging up a whole</text>
  <text start="85.58" dur="4.05">bunch of old posts that we already</text>
  <text start="87.59" dur="3.87">pretty much understand look the idea is</text>
  <text start="89.63" dur="3.84">this Democrats don&amp;#39;t want voter ID</text>
  <text start="91.46" dur="4.26">because they&amp;#39;re trying to ship everybody</text>
  <text start="93.47" dur="3.929">from across the borders to get in and</text>
  <text start="95.72" dur="3.75">vote Democrat they think that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="97.399" dur="3.151">virtuous thing to do and they think that</text>
  <text start="99.47" dur="3.269">all these people that are gonna come</text>
  <text start="100.55" dur="4.11">across the border illegally are just</text>
  <text start="102.739" dur="3.841">going to sort of blindly vote Democrat</text>
  <text start="104.66" dur="3.75">they might even be surprised to find out</text>
  <text start="106.58" dur="4.14">that they won&amp;#39;t but that&amp;#39;s the whole</text>
  <text start="108.41" dur="3.75">idea right they want to go ahead and fix</text>
  <text start="110.72" dur="2.7">these elections and of course this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="112.16" dur="3.18">the first time we&amp;#39;ve had a rigged</text>
  <text start="113.42" dur="3.75">election we&amp;#39;ve already seen the evidence</text>
  <text start="115.34" dur="3.6">in this last election I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="117.17" dur="3.66">surprised if Barack Obama&amp;#39;s numbers were</text>
  <text start="118.94" dur="3.299">a little bit inflated as well and of</text>
  <text start="120.83" dur="2.97">course anybody who&amp;#39;s either lived in</text>
  <text start="122.239" dur="3.24">Arkansas or familiar with the Clintons</text>
  <text start="123.8" dur="3.929">for decades we know that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="125.479" dur="4.081">fixing it for a long time who really</text>
  <text start="127.729" dur="3.661">knows how long time to spend going on</text>
  <text start="129.56" dur="5.31">but one thing that would help a lot</text>
  <text start="131.39" dur="6.03">would be a voter ID and you know look if</text>
  <text start="134.87" dur="5.1">you need this do you need an ID to shoot</text>
  <text start="137.42" dur="5.37">to sign up for cable or for internet or</text>
  <text start="139.97" dur="4.049">this or not you need an ID to drive car</text>
  <text start="142.79" dur="3.479">and you need an idea to do a lot of</text>
  <text start="144.019" dur="4.891">things and you know so I would assume</text>
  <text start="146.269" dur="4.771">that needing an ID to vote seems pretty</text>
  <text start="148.91" dur="3.96">logical to me well Democrats don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="151.04" dur="3.96">logic and all you have to do is watch</text>
  <text start="152.87" dur="4.199">their debates to understand that and I</text>
  <text start="155" dur="4.44">think we all truly understand this we</text>
  <text start="157.069" dur="4.681">also know that you know essentially</text>
  <text start="159.44" dur="3.99">their their highest demographic are</text>
  <text start="161.75" dur="4.439">illegal immigrants we&amp;#39;ve seen it on</text>
  <text start="163.43" dur="5.33">these heat maps that Q has sent us</text>
  <text start="166.189" dur="4.761">before we get this idea</text>
  <text start="168.76" dur="4.56">helps voter ID is gonna be a big deal</text>
  <text start="170.95" dur="3.57">and POTUS is already pushing that ID and</text>

  <text start="313.419" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s when all these fancy little lines</text>
  <text start="315.07" dur="5.129">are here just basically saying that you</text>
  <text start="317.199" dur="4.891">talked about this last year and that</text>
  <text start="320.199" dur="3.69">pushing voter ID would really be the big</text>
  <text start="322.09" dur="4.079">thing there so thanks you know I</text>
  <text start="323.889" dur="14.071">appreciate that graphic there cue says</text>

  <text start="337.96" dur="2.97">minutes out of the hour 12 see this is</text>
  <text start="339.639" dur="2.971">why I didn&amp;#39;t go back over these cue</text>
  <text start="340.93" dur="4.41">posts because they just came back to us</text>
  <text start="342.61" dur="5.73">here this is a post from February 11th</text>
  <text start="345.34" dur="4.86">and this was talking about voter ID and</text>
  <text start="348.34" dur="3.21">the graphic up here it&amp;#39;s rather small I</text>
  <text start="350.2" dur="3.45">know but you can see these little blue</text>
  <text start="351.55" dur="4.26">dots right here these are where illegal</text>
  <text start="353.65" dur="3.72">immigrants tend to settle and then of</text>
  <text start="355.81" dur="3.69">course the red dots here where they tend</text>
  <text start="357.37" dur="6.09">to vote Democrat not only enough to the</text>
  <text start="359.5" dur="5.82">same exact places and accuse just going</text>
  <text start="363.46" dur="4.079">over why the Democrats push for no voter</text>
  <text start="365.32" dur="4.319">ID well we know that it&amp;#39;s because the</text>
  <text start="367.539" dur="5.401">illegal immigrants are their voter base</text>
  <text start="369.639" dur="5.611">now and it talks about voter ID not</text>
  <text start="372.94" dur="4.409">suppressing votes or deterring minority</text>
  <text start="375.25" dur="3.84">that was ruled by the Supreme Court six</text>
  <text start="377.349" dur="3.69">to three so we&amp;#39;ve already got the</text>
  <text start="379.09" dur="3.509">support on this it looks like ID is</text>
  <text start="381.039" dur="3.63">going to be a good idea and to be quite</text>
  <text start="382.599" dur="4.411">honest with you I think a lot of</text>
  <text start="384.669" dur="4.441">Democrats that are you know rather</text>
  <text start="387.01" dur="4.56">centrist or maybe getting a little bit</text>
  <text start="389.11" dur="4.86">tired all this mess people that aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="391.57" dur="4.44">necessarily unhinged I think they even</text>
  <text start="393.97" dur="4.41">if they think that Trump meddled in the</text>
  <text start="396.01" dur="4.26">election I think they would probably be</text>
  <text start="398.38" dur="4.83">down for voter ID so I don&amp;#39;t think that</text>
  <text start="400.27" dur="4.32">this is going to be that hard to to deal</text>
  <text start="403.21" dur="4.13">with but I do think that there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="404.59" dur="6.09">to be that you know that faction of</text>
  <text start="407.34" dur="5.35">unhinged Democratic left if you will</text>
  <text start="410.68" dur="3.9">that are going to say that this is a</text>
  <text start="412.69" dur="3.27">suppression of minority votes well the</text>
  <text start="414.58" dur="3.059">real minorities that are getting</text>
  <text start="415.96" dur="2.61">suppressed here are illegal immigrants</text>
  <text start="417.639" dur="2.611">and that&amp;#39;s the way it ought to be</text>
  <text start="418.57" dur="4.44">because you&amp;#39;re not allowed to vote in</text>
  <text start="420.25" dur="5.039">anybody else&amp;#39;s election either prepare</text>
  <text start="423.01" dur="3.93">for voter ID voter suppression of</text>
  <text start="425.289" dur="3.541">minority vote so it looks like this is</text>
  <text start="426.94" dur="4.2">going to come out there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="428.83" dur="4.32">big push to this I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised</text>
  <text start="431.14" dur="3.66">if something gets implemented by the</text>
  <text start="433.15" dur="1.9">time we have a presidential election</text>
  <text start="434.8" dur="1.63">because</text>
  <text start="435.05" dur="2.73">that&amp;#39;s what this is really about and I</text>
  <text start="436.43" dur="3.03">think they know they don&amp;#39;t have a really</text>
  <text start="437.78" dur="3.18">good chance of winning I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="439.46" dur="3.449">about the only way they can cheat and</text>
  <text start="440.96" dur="3.989">like you just said that it happened</text>
  <text start="442.909" dur="2.641">before it&amp;#39;s gonna happen again so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="444.949" dur="3.571">move on</text>
  <text start="445.55" dur="4.709">oh it&amp;#39;s thirty five fifty five fifty two</text>
  <text start="448.52" dur="3.869">minutes out of the hour of 12 we get</text>
  <text start="450.259" dur="4.081">another Twitter link to Devon Nunez down</text>

  <text start="496.57" dur="4.62">point is is that Devin Nunez made this</text>

  <text start="1173.88" dur="2.79">you I said most of you probably</text>
  <text start="1175.29" dur="3.51">understand where we&amp;#39;re going with this</text>

  <text start="1178.8" dur="3.06">the deal</text>
  <text start="1179.4" dur="4.409">groups like the Red Cross not just the</text>
  <text start="1181.86" dur="3.63">Red Cross but groups like it will go</text>
  <text start="1183.809" dur="3.511">into these countries that have either</text>
  <text start="1185.49" dur="3.78">been struck with some sort of thing like</text>
  <text start="1187.32" dur="3.96">a hurricane or something like that Haiti</text>
  <text start="1189.27" dur="3.92">earthquake all these places where you</text>
  <text start="1191.28" dur="4.83">get a lot of displaced families and</text>
  <text start="1193.19" dur="4.78">animals and whatnot and then go in there</text>
  <text start="1196.11" dur="3.54">under the guise of humanitarian aid of</text>
  <text start="1197.97" dur="4.589">course they get tons and tons of</text>
  <text start="1199.65" dur="5.37">taxpayer dollars to go do so and they</text>
  <text start="1202.559" dur="4.741">rarely are able to fulfill their mission</text>
  <text start="1205.02" dur="4.2">of course although a lot of people would</text>
  <text start="1207.3" dur="3.54">like to blame Trump for that it&amp;#39;s these</text>
  <text start="1209.22" dur="3.72">groups who aren&amp;#39;t fulfilling what</text>
  <text start="1210.84" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re supposed to do but what ends up</text>
  <text start="1212.94" dur="3.869">happening is that they end up grabbing a</text>
  <text start="1214.53" dur="4.05">bunch of these displaced kids and then</text>
  <text start="1216.809" dur="4.291">we have also in these crazy situations</text>
  <text start="1218.58" dur="4.65">like we did with Laura Silsbee who was</text>
  <text start="1221.1" dur="4.11">trafficking these kids from across the</text>
  <text start="1223.23" dur="4.98">border from Haiti and the Dominican</text>

  <text start="1228.21" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re able to do it because of theirs</text>
  <text start="1230.25" dur="3.69">like I said these plate people are</text>
  <text start="1231.72" dur="3.45">displaced everything is chaotic right</text>
  <text start="1233.94" dur="2.67">there and they&amp;#39;ve either dealt with a</text>
  <text start="1235.17" dur="4.05">hurricane or a typhoon or whatnot</text>
  <text start="1236.61" dur="4.26">flooding earthquakes and so you got kids</text>
  <text start="1239.22" dur="3.54">running all over the place meanwhile the</text>
  <text start="1240.87" dur="3.51">Red Cross comes in takes a whole bunch</text>
  <text start="1242.76" dur="4.71">of blood takes a whole bunch of money</text>
  <text start="1244.38" dur="5.91">but struggles to fulfill its Disaster</text>
  <text start="1247.47" dur="3.78">Response mission why I would like to</text>
  <text start="1250.29" dur="2.67">argue that they&amp;#39;re probably not</text>
  <text start="1251.25" dur="2.73">struggling with their actual mission</text>
  <text start="1252.96" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re just not telling us what their</text>
  <text start="1253.98" dur="3.81">actual mission is so if you&amp;#39;re picking</text>
  <text start="1256.14" dur="3.539">up what I&amp;#39;m putting down here this is</text>
  <text start="1257.79" dur="3.96">what leads to a lot of human trafficking</text>
  <text start="1259.679" dur="4.441">a lot of kids get assured out of these</text>
  <text start="1261.75" dur="5.22">countries in the wake of these disasters</text>
  <text start="1264.12" dur="5.1">and put into these adoption agencies</text>

  <text start="1270.63" dur="4.1">trafficking problems begin and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1272.73" dur="4.47">starting to see a lot of these different</text>

  <text start="1277.2" dur="3.93">that are related to this how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1278.97" dur="3.96">relating to the shipping industries the</text>
  <text start="1281.13" dur="4.08">port industries and then of course</text>
  <text start="1282.93" dur="4.29">adoption agencies once they get either</text>
  <text start="1285.21" dur="4.62">into the US or wherever they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1287.22" dur="4.77">and we just saw the black sirs and boxes</text>
  <text start="1289.83" dur="4.14">that of all that cash to the American</text>
  <text start="1291.99" dur="3.75">Red Cross is taken well if they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1293.97" dur="3.66">fulfilling their mission one of they do</text>
  <text start="1295.74" dur="3.42">one with all that coin well Chuck Chuck</text>
  <text start="1297.63" dur="3.39">Grassley just said that his</text>
  <text start="1299.16" dur="3.57">investigations have been quashed and</text>
  <text start="1301.02" dur="4.29">this is essentially what this is this is</text>
  <text start="1302.73" dur="4.71">an investigation from June of 2016 and</text>
  <text start="1305.31" dur="3.36">this is a 300-page document so we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1307.44" dur="3.03">going to cruise through this but it just</text>
  <text start="1308.67" dur="4.38">mentions Haiti right in the beginning</text>
  <text start="1310.47" dur="4.56">here and what they were trying to do as</text>
  <text start="1313.05" dur="3.81">a result of these challenges arsc being</text>
  <text start="1315.03" dur="3.42">the American Red Cross struggle to</text>
  <text start="1316.86" dur="3.42">fulfill some of its pledges for Haiti</text>
  <text start="1318.45" dur="3.06">yeah that is a pretty much an</text>
  <text start="1320.28" dur="3.09">understatement they said they were gonna</text>
  <text start="1321.51" dur="4.32">build a bunch of homes and they most</text>
  <text start="1323.37" dur="4.32">certainly did not they raped Haiti of</text>
  <text start="1325.83" dur="4.17">all their resources their children</text>
  <text start="1327.69" dur="5.13">meanwhile the Clinton Foundation went in</text>
  <text start="1330" dur="5.01">there also and gave Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1332.82" dur="4.17">brother access to their gold mine so</text>
  <text start="1335.01" dur="4.62">they were literally raping this country</text>
  <text start="1336.99" dur="5.16">now the last link takes you here and</text>
  <text start="1339.63" dur="6.24">this was the very next day this was</text>
  <text start="1342.15" dur="8.01">dated June 15 2016 this is June 16 2016</text>
  <text start="1345.87" dur="6.84">from NPR report red cross bands 20 spent</text>
  <text start="1350.16" dur="4.23">25% of Haiti donations on internal</text>
  <text start="1352.71" dur="4.65">expenses yeah I think on average about</text>
  <text start="1354.39" dur="5.61">10 cents to the dollar actually goes to</text>
  <text start="1357.36" dur="4.65">some sort of you know something</text>
  <text start="1360" dur="3.9">productive really the rest goes right to</text>
  <text start="1362.01" dur="3.78">them the American Red Cross spent a</text>
  <text start="1363.9" dur="4.05">quarter of the money people donated</text>
  <text start="1365.79" dur="5.88">after the 2010 Haiti earthquake or</text>
  <text start="1367.95" dur="5.85">almost 125 million on its own internal</text>
  <text start="1371.67" dur="4.44">expenses far more than the charity</text>
  <text start="1373.8" dur="4.44">previously had disclosed according to a</text>
  <text start="1376.11" dur="4.23">report released Thursday by Iowa Senator</text>
  <text start="1378.24" dur="3.54">Chuck Grassley so as you can see this</text>
  <text start="1380.34" dur="3.72">has been something that Grassley&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1381.78" dur="4.08">on for quite some time the report also</text>
  <text start="1384.06" dur="4.35">says the charity&amp;#39;s top official</text>
  <text start="1385.86" dur="4.38">stonewalled congressional investigators</text>
  <text start="1388.41" dur="3.93">and released incomplete information</text>
  <text start="1390.24" dur="4.59">about a Taney program to the public it</text>
  <text start="1392.34" dur="4.53">concludes their abstention and</text>
  <text start="1394.83" dur="4.77">fundamental concerns about the red cross</text>
  <text start="1396.87" dur="4.56">as an organization the report follows a</text>
  <text start="1399.6" dur="2.549">nearly year-long investigation by the</text>
  <text start="1401.43" dur="3.179">Iowa</text>
  <text start="1402.149" dur="4.86">and his staff launched after coverage by</text>
  <text start="1404.609" dur="4.92">NPR and ProPublica of the Red Cross</text>
  <text start="1407.009" dur="5.01">Haiti response the venerated charity</text>
  <text start="1409.529" dur="3.99">raised nearly 500 million dollars after</text>
  <text start="1412.019" dur="3.75">the disaster more than any other</text>
  <text start="1413.519" dur="4.68">nonprofit but an ambitious plan to build</text>
  <text start="1415.769" dur="6.18">housing resulted in just six permanent</text>
  <text start="1418.199" dur="6.09">homes NPR and ProPublica found so this</text>
  <text start="1421.949" dur="3.99">was a big deal and like I just said this</text>
  <text start="1424.289" dur="3.96">is more than just taking in a whole</text>
  <text start="1425.939" dur="4.29">bunch of cash they are also taking in</text>
  <text start="1428.249" dur="3.96">blood and I&amp;#39;m sure you can pretty much</text>
  <text start="1430.229" dur="3.57">imagine what they&amp;#39;re doing with some of</text>
  <text start="1432.209" dur="4.59">that blood right</text>
  <text start="1433.799" dur="5.19">but this charity&amp;#39;s long been suspect but</text>
  <text start="1436.799" dur="4.35">as long as you hire a couple of big-name</text>
  <text start="1438.989" dur="3.48">actors or singers or whatever to tell</text>
  <text start="1441.149" dur="2.88">the public that this is what it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1442.469" dur="3.03">about and you&amp;#39;re a racist if you</text>
  <text start="1444.029" dur="2.34">disagree or if you think that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1445.499" dur="2.88">gonna call their bluff</text>
  <text start="1446.369" dur="3.66">that&amp;#39;s how its work they&amp;#39;ve always used</text>
  <text start="1448.379" dur="3.42">virtue signaling to make you think that</text>
  <text start="1450.029" dur="3.54">if you&amp;#39;re against this then you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1451.799" dur="3.63">obviously not supporting Haiti or you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1453.569" dur="2.94">obviously not supporting Hurricane</text>
  <text start="1455.429" dur="2.85">Katrina or whatnot</text>
  <text start="1456.509" dur="3.33">fact of the matter is you just know</text>
  <text start="1458.279" dur="3.75">better you know that your money is not</text>
  <text start="1459.839" dur="4.02">going to these organizations so if</text>
  <text start="1462.029" dur="3.51">you&amp;#39;re looking to dedicate you know to</text>
  <text start="1463.859" dur="3.24">donate some money I think that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1465.539" dur="3.23">fantastic thing and I think that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1467.099" dur="3.03">a lot of fantastic charities out there</text>
  <text start="1468.769" dur="4.18">unfortunately a lot of that</text>
  <text start="1470.129" dur="4.38">responsibility is leaning on us to do</text>
  <text start="1472.949" dur="2.79">our research into these charities and to</text>
  <text start="1474.509" dur="3.42">make sure that we know where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1475.739" dur="3.99">going but it looks like chuck grassley</text>
  <text start="1477.929" dur="4.23">knows exactly all about that but the</text>
  <text start="1479.729" dur="5.52">real key here is this right here I think</text>
  <text start="1482.159" dur="5.22">this American Red Cross transparency act</text>
  <text start="1485.249" dur="4.32">and of course QG just posted those boxes</text>
  <text start="1487.379" dur="3.9">and boxes of cash so I have a feeling</text>
  <text start="1489.569" dur="5.01">that we&amp;#39;re gonna get some more news on</text>
  <text start="1491.279" dur="5.28">that once again q says the more you know</text>
  <text start="1494.579" dur="4.98">and if you uh you&amp;#39;ve kind of caught on</text>
  <text start="1496.559" dur="5.46">to my edits that is a catchphrase for</text>
  <text start="1499.559" dur="3.63">MBC and it has been it was an old old</text>
  <text start="1502.019" dur="3.03">catchphrase for them</text>
  <text start="1503.189" dur="4.92">MSM coverage no of course they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1505.049" dur="5.16">covering that now to be fair they did</text>
  <text start="1508.109" dur="4.53">report on some of this back in about</text>
  <text start="1510.209" dur="4.92">2016 they did report this and they did</text>
  <text start="1512.639" dur="4.38">it was actually on MSNBC wet Red Cross</text>
  <text start="1515.129" dur="6.66">kind of fought back but I think a lot of</text>
  <text start="1517.019" dur="6.51">that was just optics now in as MSNBC has</text>
