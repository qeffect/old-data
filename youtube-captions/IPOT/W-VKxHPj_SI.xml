  <text start="87.39" dur="4.95">yesterday I forgot to put in 34:19 I</text>
  <text start="90" dur="3.84">actually recorded this and that my</text>
  <text start="92.34" dur="3.6">software shut down again as you guys</text>
  <text start="93.84" dur="4.38">know I&amp;#39;m having some tech issues and</text>
  <text start="95.94" dur="4.83">when I rebooted it and redid everything</text>
  <text start="98.22" dur="3.75">I forgot to put this entry back in so</text>
  <text start="100.77" dur="3">I&amp;#39;m gonna just kind of cruise through</text>
  <text start="101.97" dur="4.32">this quick this was dealing with singer</text>
  <text start="103.77" dur="4.32">R Kelly here&amp;#39;s the article r Kelly</text>
  <text start="106.29" dur="4.86">arrested in Chicago on federal child</text>
  <text start="108.09" dur="5.82">pornography charges faces NYC indictment</text>
  <text start="111.15" dur="5.07">also this is thirteen new indictments</text>
  <text start="113.91" dur="5.49">now we knew these were kind of coming</text>
  <text start="116.22" dur="5.7">but there&amp;#39;s a real oddity here with this</text>
  <text start="119.4" dur="4.41">whole story and I want to save some of</text>
  <text start="121.92" dur="3.93">this because it&amp;#39;s actually in part of my</text>
  <text start="123.81" dur="3.84">weathermen video but I want to turn you</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="4.68">on to a couple connections just in a</text>
  <text start="127.65" dur="4.98">general level first of all are Kelly&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="130.53" dur="4.17">already had been charged and a lot of</text>
  <text start="132.63" dur="4.29">those charges were drops 14 charges were</text>
  <text start="134.7" dur="3.78">dropped against our Kelly that was</text>
  <text start="136.92" dur="4.32">really really suspect a lot of</text>
  <text start="138.48" dur="4.11">celebrities came out against our Kelly</text>
  <text start="141.24" dur="2.94">and that&amp;#39;s a real important thing</text>
  <text start="142.59" dur="4.32">remember this had to do with me too and</text>
  <text start="144.18" dur="5.7">that I&amp;#39;m gonna laugh so now we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="146.91" dur="5.19">these new charges but somewhere in the</text>
  <text start="149.88" dur="4.74">meantime is really the sketchy part this</text>
  <text start="152.1" dur="4.8">is where we had the story of creepy porn</text>
  <text start="154.62" dur="4.83">lawyer Michael avenatti who had come out</text>
  <text start="156.9" dur="4.8">saying that he had had some videos of</text>
  <text start="159.45" dur="5.64">our Kelly well fair enough but how did</text>
  <text start="161.7" dur="5.58">you get them and avenatti hasn&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="165.09" dur="4.83">real forthright about that now since</text>
  <text start="167.28" dur="5.01">then we know that avenatti himself has</text>
  <text start="169.92" dur="5.43">had some trouble with the law in regards</text>
  <text start="172.29" dur="4.8">to how he handled nike the other guy</text>
  <text start="175.35" dur="5.46">that was popped along with avenatti was</text>
  <text start="177.09" dur="6.81">one Mark Geragos now Geragos happens to</text>
  <text start="180.81" dur="5.28">also be representing jussie Smollett</text>
  <text start="183.9" dur="5.67">that&amp;#39;s another Cook County case in which</text>
  <text start="186.09" dur="4.95">Kym Fox was involved so Kim Fox seems to</text>
  <text start="189.57" dur="3.24">have a bias towards Kelly and not so</text>
  <text start="191.04" dur="3.18">much jessi small but it&amp;#39;s all Cook</text>
  <text start="192.81" dur="4.56">County and I want to point that out</text>
  <text start="194.22" dur="5.01">another key client of Geragos is of</text>
  <text start="197.37" dur="5.07">course Claire Bronfman who&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="199.23" dur="6.15">arrested on the whole nexium issue so</text>
  <text start="202.44" dur="5.97">this are Kelly stories to me sounds like</text>
  <text start="205.38" dur="5.46">it sounds like to me like somebody got</text>
  <text start="208.41" dur="4.049">upset with our Kelly and decided to go</text>
  <text start="210.84" dur="4.2">ahead and cash his little insurance</text>
  <text start="212.459" dur="4.381">policy and if you know what I mean many</text>
  <text start="215.04" dur="2.98">of these stars probably have these kinds</text>
  <text start="216.84" dur="2.89">of videos</text>
  <text start="218.02" dur="3.03">and it looks like somebody just uh you</text>
  <text start="219.73" dur="3.24">know maybe our killer cross the line or</text>
  <text start="221.05" dur="4.35">whatever and somebody decided to cash in</text>
  <text start="222.97" dur="4.5">but that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m getting out of this</text>
  <text start="225.4" dur="4.35">now keep in mind too that avenatti also</text>
  <text start="227.47" dur="5.48">represented stormy Daniels and we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="229.75" dur="6.06">know for a fact but we we have that</text>
  <text start="232.95" dur="5.32">picture of stormy Daniels tattoo which</text>
  <text start="235.81" dur="4.77">looks oddly like the nexium brand and</text>
  <text start="238.27" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t forget if you remember she got</text>
  <text start="240.58" dur="5.69">popped on this a little charge</text>
  <text start="243.13" dur="5.22">motorboating a cop in a strip club and</text>
  <text start="246.27" dur="4.3">it wasn&amp;#39;t a big deal</text>
  <text start="248.35" dur="3.99">at least with the mainstream media they</text>
  <text start="250.57" dur="3.24">let her go right away and no one ever</text>
  <text start="252.34" dur="3.51">talked about it again but I do want to</text>
  <text start="253.81" dur="3.989">point out that that arrests a little</text>
  <text start="255.85" dur="3.99">known fact that people talked about or</text>
  <text start="257.799" dur="4.621">didn&amp;#39;t talk about excuse me was that</text>
  <text start="259.84" dur="5.49">that arrests came as part of a human</text>
  <text start="262.42" dur="5.1">trafficking ongoing investigation that</text>
  <text start="265.33" dur="4.05">was one little detail they swept under</text>
  <text start="267.52" dur="2.97">the rug so it&amp;#39;s all connected I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="269.38" dur="3.87">add a little bit more into the</text>
  <text start="270.49" dur="4.38">Weathermen but that is that for now and</text>
  <text start="273.25" dur="4.17">that&amp;#39;s probably how this is all related</text>
  <text start="274.87" dur="5.55">why we saw this post regarding all our</text>
  <text start="277.42" dur="6.81">Kelly in the middle of all these Epstein</text>
  <text start="280.42" dur="6.45">drops so there you go back to</text>
  <text start="284.23" dur="5.43">present-day post 3421 where we get this</text>
  <text start="286.87" dur="6.51">screenshot here at post 20 874 from</text>
  <text start="289.66" dur="7.02">February 22nd 2019 and it was a Twitter</text>

  <text start="301.36" dur="4.38">sex abuse yeah it looks like they were</text>
  <text start="303.67" dur="4.98">doing some funky stuff to make sure that</text>
  <text start="305.74" dur="4.71">Epstein didn&amp;#39;t go away for too long and</text>
  <text start="308.65" dur="5.61">probably likely to protect other</text>
  <text start="310.45" dur="7.02">co-conspirators and it seemed like labor</text>
  <text start="314.26" dur="5.85">ter labor secretary Acosta was very very</text>
  <text start="317.47" dur="4.92">engaged in this whole thing all right</text>

  <text start="322.39" dur="4.26">admin if majority of those in politics</text>
  <text start="324.64" dur="5.43">are corrupt draining the swamp</text>
  <text start="326.65" dur="5.01">alright well Q is said about 70% and you</text>
  <text start="330.07" dur="2.88">know who knows how many it really is but</text>
  <text start="331.66" dur="3.03">look there&amp;#39;s a lot of people who are</text>
  <text start="332.95" dur="3.48">probably even playing white hat roles</text>
  <text start="334.69" dur="3.63">that probably got a little bit of gray</text>
  <text start="336.43" dur="3.72">on those hats right it&amp;#39;s not that simple</text>
  <text start="338.32" dur="3.96">but there are a lot of people that are</text>
  <text start="340.15" dur="3.96">playing along and who knows what kind of</text>
  <text start="342.28" dur="5.01">deals everyone&amp;#39;s made we may never</text>
  <text start="344.11" dur="5.339">really truly know but we do know that</text>
  <text start="347.29" dur="5.219">the swamp is deep and</text>
  <text start="349.449" dur="4.77">I sure hope that eventually we get John</text>

  <text start="385.4" dur="3.27">Friday morning during remarks to</text>
  <text start="387.02" dur="3.36">reporters outside the White House</text>
  <text start="388.67" dur="4.26">Acosta said he submitted his resignation</text>
  <text start="390.38" dur="4.8">to the president that morning and would</text>
  <text start="392.93" dur="3.57">resign from his post next week over the</text>
  <text start="395.18" dur="3.03">last week I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of coverage</text>
  <text start="396.5" dur="3.36">about the Department of Labor Acosta</text>
  <text start="398.21" dur="3.51">said noting the reports have been</text>
  <text start="399.86" dur="5.39">related to the Epstein controversy and</text>
  <text start="401.72" dur="7.95">not success at the agency yeah well that</text>
  <text start="405.25" dur="6.19">Epstein controversy isn&amp;#39;t a success I do</text>
  <text start="409.67" dur="3.51">not think it is right and fair for this</text>
  <text start="411.44" dur="3.84">administration&amp;#39;s Labor Department tap</text>
  <text start="413.18" dur="4.8">Epstein is the focus rather than the</text>
  <text start="415.28" dur="4.62">incredible economy we have today oh so I</text>
  <text start="417.98" dur="4.38">suppose you understand now how President</text>
  <text start="419.9" dur="4.26">Trump has felt for the last two freaking</text>
  <text start="422.36" dur="4.29">years I called the president today I</text>
  <text start="424.16" dur="3.93">submitted my resignation Acosta said it</text>
  <text start="426.65" dur="3">would be selfish for me to stay in this</text>
  <text start="428.09" dur="4.14">position and continue talking about a</text>
  <text start="429.65" dur="5.16">case that is 12 years old rather than</text>
  <text start="432.23" dur="5.88">the incredible economy we have today</text>
  <text start="434.81" dur="6.48">okay so this is essentially some</text>
  <text start="438.11" dur="5.49">projecting by mr. Acosta says down here</text>
  <text start="441.29" dur="3.57">the deal was criticized as lenient yeah</text>
  <text start="443.6" dur="3.06">you don&amp;#39;t say he&amp;#39;s already out of jail</text>
  <text start="444.86" dur="4.59">because Epstein could have faced a life</text>
  <text start="446.66" dur="4.71">sentence Acosta negotiated a deal that</text>
  <text start="449.45" dur="5.22">resulted in two state solicitation</text>
  <text start="451.37" dur="4.68">charges but no federal charges and I</text>
  <text start="454.67" dur="4.5">want to add that the whole reason that</text>
  <text start="456.05" dur="6.36">Epstein is even back in the spotlight</text>
  <text start="459.17" dur="4.68">with all of this is that B all the new</text>
  <text start="462.41" dur="3.21">indictments were allowed in they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="463.85" dur="4.02">really all that new they just weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="465.62" dur="4.08">being admitted and so all this time</text>
  <text start="467.87" dur="3.57">Epstein wasn&amp;#39;t really being properly</text>
  <text start="469.7" dur="3.54">charged and that&amp;#39;s essentially what I</text>
  <text start="471.44" dur="3.93">get out of this whole thing and of</text>
  <text start="473.24" dur="5.16">course a cost there was a big part of</text>
  <text start="475.37" dur="5.46">this negotiation so back to the Q post</text>
  <text start="478.4" dur="3.69">you can see what Q is pointing out here</text>
  <text start="480.83" dur="2.88">is that a cost has one of those guys</text>
  <text start="482.09" dur="4.5">that obviously was filling a position</text>
  <text start="483.71" dur="4.71">for a certain amount of time but he was</text>
  <text start="486.59" dur="2.61">most certainly not the perfect man for</text>
  <text start="488.42" dur="2.97">the job</text>
  <text start="489.2" dur="4.23">and very much like you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="491.39" dur="4.47">personally referencing John Bolton you</text>
  <text start="493.43" dur="4.02">may like him you may not but I feel very</text>
  <text start="495.86" dur="3.45">much the same way this guy doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="497.45" dur="3.96">really seem to have our interest a lot</text>
  <text start="499.31" dur="2.55">seems to want to go make war all over</text>
  <text start="501.41" dur="2.819">the</text>
  <text start="501.86" dur="5.339">world and yet at the same time he might</text>
  <text start="504.229" dur="4.831">be the very best guy right now</text>
  <text start="507.199" dur="5.01">considering all the people that are so</text>
  <text start="509.06" dur="5.43">dead set against POTUS even being in the</text>
  <text start="512.209" dur="3.481">presidency so just a point that I want</text>
  <text start="514.49" dur="2.669">to make and I think that&amp;#39;s the point Q</text>
  <text start="515.69" dur="2.909">is trying to make now sometimes you got</text>
  <text start="517.159" dur="3.901">to work with your enemies keep them</text>
  <text start="518.599" dur="5.07">close because that&amp;#39;s about the only way</text>
  <text start="521.06" dur="5.01">we can get anything done and not to</text>
  <text start="523.669" dur="4.29">mention we may still be finding out who</text>
  <text start="526.07" dur="4.5">some of these swamp creatures are by</text>
  <text start="527.959" dur="4.051">their by their actions but this is big</text>
  <text start="530.57" dur="3.54">news the epstein thing is definitely</text>
  <text start="532.01" dur="4.59">blowing up across this projection seems</text>
  <text start="534.11" dur="4.65">to suggest that he does have a big big</text>
  <text start="536.6" dur="5.489">role which we already kind of suspected</text>
  <text start="538.76" dur="5.43">let&amp;#39;s move on to 30 for 20 to 26 minutes</text>
  <text start="542.089" dur="4.321">out to the hour and nine we get this</text>
  <text start="544.19" dur="3.92">simply in brackets New York Society for</text>

  <text start="559.7" dur="3.569">but we&amp;#39;re imagining that since Q is</text>
  <text start="561.32" dur="4.92">lumping this in with all these other</text>
  <text start="563.269" dur="5.701">posts we can probably assume that Q is</text>
  <text start="566.24" dur="4.26">implying to look deeper into the origins</text>
  <text start="568.97" dur="3.03">of this group and this is an old group</text>

  <text start="580.49" dur="3.959">often what we found in looking at these</text>
  <text start="582.26" dur="4.86">foundations is that they turned out to</text>
  <text start="584.449" dur="5.311">be glorified slush funds and oftentimes</text>
  <text start="587.12" dur="5.37">are guilty of the very things that they</text>
  <text start="589.76" dur="4.47">claim to be preventing now we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="592.49" dur="3.779">that for sure I&amp;#39;m just letting you know</text>
  <text start="594.23" dur="4.14">that that&amp;#39;s kind of what we found over</text>
  <text start="596.269" dur="4.641">the past and there&amp;#39;s a few red flags</text>
  <text start="598.37" dur="5.01">here but I just want to really point a</text>
  <text start="600.91" dur="4.09">couple of the obvious things out here</text>
  <text start="603.38" dur="3.93">this first one or the couple events that</text>

  <text start="1426" dur="3.6">there you go and this shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1427.05" dur="4.5">surprising to us I would imagine that if</text>
  <text start="1429.6" dur="3.57">POTUS really were worried about anything</text>
  <text start="1431.55" dur="3.3">coming out here they never would have</text>
  <text start="1433.17" dur="3.18">made it a big deal in the first place an</text>
  <text start="1434.85" dur="3.66">Epstein probably never would have even</text>
  <text start="1436.35" dur="5.73">been arrested in the first place</text>
  <text start="1438.51" dur="4.8">so you know there you go these logs are</text>
  <text start="1442.08" dur="3.11">going to be pretty damning it looks like</text>
  <text start="1443.31" dur="4.44">these wheels up might be included also</text>
  <text start="1445.19" dur="5.74">it seems to me to make a whole lot of</text>
  <text start="1447.75" dur="4.86">sense and once we find out really the</text>
  <text start="1450.93" dur="4.02">whole scope who is not only on just</text>
  <text start="1452.61" dur="5.82">Epstein&amp;#39;s logs but maybe Epstein&amp;#39;s other</text>
  <text start="1454.95" dur="5.82">logs or these wheels-up logs we may find</text>
  <text start="1458.43" dur="4.14">out really how pervasive this really was</text>
  <text start="1460.77" dur="3.66">now I just want to add this other</text>
  <text start="1462.57" dur="3.27">article in from Fox News there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1464.43" dur="4.53">little video here I&amp;#39;ll include this</text>
  <text start="1465.84" dur="5.16">because this this text is really really</text>
  <text start="1468.96" dur="4.29">small but basically what happened here</text>
  <text start="1471" dur="4.26">is another employee who was on the</text>
  <text start="1473.25" dur="4.08">Epstein Island who had also claimed to</text>
  <text start="1475.26" dur="4.86">have seen Bill Clinton there was saying</text>
  <text start="1477.33" dur="4.74">that Epstein kept a steel safe in his</text>
  <text start="1480.12" dur="4.26">office and then it contained more than</text>
  <text start="1482.07" dur="4.53">just money and who knows this very well</text>
  <text start="1484.38" dur="3.75">could be like I was talking about these</text>
  <text start="1486.6" dur="3.75">insurance policies right whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1488.13" dur="4.08">tapes or recordings of people who have</text>
  <text start="1490.35" dur="3.66">been on the island in order to keep them</text>
  <text start="1492.21" dur="3.21">silent we&amp;#39;re not really sure but it</text>
  <text start="1494.01" dur="2.94">looks like they know about it and if</text>
  <text start="1495.42" dur="3.3">they know about it their chances are</text>
  <text start="1496.95" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re probably investigating it right</text>
  <text start="1498.72" dur="4.08">and this came from an employee all these</text>
  <text start="1500.97" dur="4.44">employees had been asked to sign</text>
  <text start="1502.8" dur="4.47">non-disclosure agreements for obvious</text>
  <text start="1505.41" dur="3.21">reasons right but it looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1507.27" dur="3.18">coming out and we&amp;#39;re gonna find out what</text>
  <text start="1508.62" dur="3.12">was in those safes and we find out what</text>
  <text start="1510.45" dur="1.819">was in those states we might find out</text>
  <text start="1511.74" dur="2.599">what was</text>
  <text start="1512.269" dur="5.73">those logs or maybe it was the longest</text>
  <text start="1514.339" dur="5.851">themselves in those safes but either way</text>
  <text start="1517.999" dur="5.821">POTUS says find out the people that went</text>
  <text start="1520.19" dur="7.229">to that Island alright so let&amp;#39;s move on</text>
