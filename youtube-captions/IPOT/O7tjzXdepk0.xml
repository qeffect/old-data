  <text start="43.989" dur="6.861">are we being attacked by people who</text>
  <text start="45.52" dur="7.65">claim to be Pro POTUS hmm okay well</text>

  <text start="77.53" dur="4.069">don&amp;#39;t know that either but there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="79.84" dur="3.9">of people that are attacking q yeah and</text>
  <text start="81.599" dur="6.071">they claim to be Pro POTUS and maybe</text>
  <text start="83.74" dur="6.359">they are maybe they are but some of them</text>
  <text start="87.67" dur="4.86">might not be seems like you might be</text>
  <text start="90.099" dur="5.461">implying that thank you says do we have</text>
  <text start="92.53" dur="10.35">a face where we haven&amp;#39;t seen them do we</text>
  <text start="95.56" dur="9.18">have a name yep q so easy I can write it</text>
  <text start="102.88" dur="4.17">I can read it I can spell it I can</text>
  <text start="104.74" dur="4.049">pronounce it thank God did we use</text>
  <text start="107.05" dur="4.53">platforms whereby we collect followers</text>
  <text start="108.789" dur="5.28">where you use H and H Han has a lot of</text>
  <text start="111.58" dur="3.84">users but those users do follow you the</text>
  <text start="114.069" dur="5.011">platform itself you don&amp;#39;t collect</text>
  <text start="115.42" dur="5.49">followers but those people from HN</text>
  <text start="119.08" dur="5.039">oftentimes translate that into other</text>
  <text start="120.91" dur="5.25">channels such as myself and others that</text>
  <text start="124.119" dur="3.45">do collect followers I guess you could</text>
  <text start="126.16" dur="4.53">call them followers I prefer to call</text>
  <text start="127.569" dur="4.981">them viewers but I think we get the</text>
  <text start="130.69" dur="3.269">point he&amp;#39;s not using a platform that</text>
  <text start="132.55" dur="3.12">actually collects followers why because</text>
  <text start="133.959" dur="4.481">they&amp;#39;re selfless zero vanity okay a</text>
  <text start="135.67" dur="5.93">little vanity q is okay alright call me</text>
  <text start="138.44" dur="7.69">brush your teeth put on a clean shirt</text>
  <text start="141.6" dur="5.7">show up to work why are we here well</text>
  <text start="146.13" dur="2.43">you&amp;#39;re here to ask questions why do we</text>
  <text start="147.3" dur="5.43">ask questions cuz that&amp;#39;s why you&amp;#39;re here</text>
  <text start="148.56" dur="7.41">I don&amp;#39;t know what you guys think it</text>
  <text start="152.73" dur="4.95">seems to me the queue wouldn&amp;#39;t have been</text>
  <text start="155.97" dur="3.63">as effective if they didn&amp;#39;t start being</text>
  <text start="157.68" dur="3.66">off by you know being so cryptic and if</text>
  <text start="159.6" dur="3.63">you&amp;#39;ve noticed over the over the time</text>
  <text start="161.34" dur="4.23">now queue has gotten less and less</text>
  <text start="163.23" dur="4.2">cryptic and I think that&amp;#39;s because we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="165.57" dur="3.45">exposed a lot more in it and that also</text>
  <text start="167.43" dur="3.99">too I think you also realize that some</text>
  <text start="169.02" dur="4.5">people don&amp;#39;t have constant patience for</text>
  <text start="171.42" dur="5.66">code breaking and all that stuff all the</text>
  <text start="173.52" dur="6.21">time I&amp;#39;m not great with it either but I</text>
  <text start="177.08" dur="4.09">think the point is is that if you</text>
  <text start="179.73" dur="3.78">weren&amp;#39;t asking questions they&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="181.17" dur="6.48">making statements and those statements</text>
  <text start="183.51" dur="7.47">would probably be discredited or maybe</text>
  <text start="187.65" dur="4.89">not even noticed but I don&amp;#39;t think the</text>
  <text start="190.98" dur="3.78">the effort would have been put into</text>
  <text start="192.54" dur="3.12">sourcing our own information and if you</text>
  <text start="194.76" dur="2.01">ask me I think that&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="195.66" dur="4.29">greatest things that&amp;#39;s come out of this</text>
  <text start="196.77" dur="5.93">Great Awakening movement the choice has</text>
  <text start="199.95" dur="6.75">always been yours I think he&amp;#39;s not wrong</text>
  <text start="202.7" dur="5.8">you can choose to be happy you can</text>
  <text start="206.7" dur="4.17">choose to be sad you can choose to click</text>
  <text start="208.5" dur="3.78">like you can choose to click unlike you</text>
  <text start="210.87" dur="2.67">can choose to follow you can choose to</text>
  <text start="212.28" dur="3.48">lead you can choose to get out of the</text>
  <text start="213.54" dur="2.61">way you can choose to care or not to</text>
  <text start="215.76" dur="2.37">care</text>
  <text start="216.15" dur="3.26">you can choose to love you can choose to</text>
  <text start="218.13" dur="5.37">hate you can choose whatever you want</text>
  <text start="219.41" dur="6.94">and keeps asking us to just use logic it</text>
  <text start="223.5" dur="6.15">free information well free information</text>
  <text start="226.35" dur="4.68">is not always free a lot of people</text>
  <text start="229.65" dur="3.54">doctoring that information and these</text>
  <text start="231.03" dur="3.63">days information it&amp;#39;s making it harder</text>
  <text start="233.19" dur="2.64">and harder for us to use logic because</text>
  <text start="234.66" dur="3.45">there&amp;#39;s a lot of disinformation out</text>
  <text start="235.83" dur="5.73">there too but at the same time we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="238.11" dur="6.09">encouraging free speech there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="241.56" dur="3.87">people that are able to say whatever</text>
  <text start="244.2" dur="4.23">they want and create a lot of</text>
  <text start="245.43" dur="6.33">disinformation there&amp;#39;s a lot of gray</text>
  <text start="248.43" dur="5.21">area in there right but I guess we got</text>
  <text start="251.76" dur="3.9">to choose whatever it is what we want</text>
  <text start="253.64" dur="3.73">for me I&amp;#39;d rather deal with a lot of</text>
  <text start="255.66" dur="2.819">disinformation and be able to sift</text>
  <text start="257.37" dur="4.23">through it and let people say what they</text>
  <text start="258.479" dur="5.341">want you tell me what you think I guess</text>
  <text start="261.6" dur="4.23">what draws people here well I guess the</text>
  <text start="263.82" dur="4.44">free information we&amp;#39;re sure not getting</text>
  <text start="265.83" dur="4.98">it on the MSM are we they&amp;#39;re not giving</text>
  <text start="268.26" dur="3.54">us much information at all I don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="270.81" dur="3.18">know what I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="271.8" dur="4.739">TV even works I don&amp;#39;t know what you</text>
  <text start="273.99" dur="3.59">think what&amp;#39;s on TV stormy Daniels is</text>
  <text start="276.539" dur="5.071">that what you want to talk about</text>
  <text start="277.58" dur="5.98">whatever whatever you want but the</text>
  <text start="281.61" dur="3.809">informations free here and however you</text>

  <text start="286.259" dur="4.44">what an amazing thing what an amazing</text>
  <text start="289.319" dur="4.141">time to be alive what draws people here</text>
  <text start="290.699" dur="5.881">the free information and the exchange of</text>

  <text start="303.36" dur="4.589">add on to it embellish it and take me in</text>

  <text start="307.949" dur="3.72">information from my next video but more</text>
  <text start="310.289" dur="3.511">importantly I&amp;#39;ve really enjoyed watching</text>
  <text start="311.669" dur="3.78">you or the way that you support each</text>
  <text start="313.8" dur="3.959">other when you know people who are maybe</text>
  <text start="315.449" dur="4.201">newer to Q have questions and there are</text>
  <text start="317.759" dur="4.56">other people that jump on onto it before</text>

  <text start="328.199" dur="4.411">it on other channels what an amazing</text>
  <text start="330.15" dur="4.29">time to be alive folks because the news</text>
  <text start="332.61" dur="3.929">isn&amp;#39;t giving us this we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="334.44" dur="5.729">figure it out ourselves and we are we</text>
  <text start="336.539" dur="6.66">are expanding and potentially it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="340.169" dur="4.74">growing it&amp;#39;s growing and growing some</text>
  <text start="343.199" dur="4.801">people probably don&amp;#39;t like that that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="344.909" dur="4.651">lot of free thought going on they all</text>
  <text start="348" dur="3.36">claim to be insiders they all claim to</text>
  <text start="349.56" dur="4.229">have insider contacts when we know that</text>
  <text start="351.36" dur="4.14">Q said no outside comms he was saying</text>
  <text start="353.789" dur="2.85">they do not and we know who he was</text>
  <text start="355.5" dur="2.43">talking about I don&amp;#39;t want it please I</text>
  <text start="356.639" dur="3.78">don&amp;#39;t want to bring up names if I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="357.93" dur="4.94">have to okay but we&amp;#39;ve had some people</text>
  <text start="360.419" dur="4.47">claim to be insiders claiming to have</text>
  <text start="362.87" dur="3.519">contact I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t have any</text>

  <text start="369.779" dur="9.301">everybody&amp;#39;s got contacts Patriots do not</text>
  <text start="374.969" dur="5.221">reveal classified information well I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="379.08" dur="1.799">say it&amp;#39;s a general rule that&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="380.19" dur="2.52">a pretty good idea</text>
  <text start="380.879" dur="4.26">okay classified information is not</text>
  <text start="382.71" dur="3.9">supposed to do that we didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="385.139" dur="3.481">patients just revealing classified</text>
  <text start="386.61" dur="4.679">information they were selling it still</text>

  <text start="391.289" dur="6.321">information right now that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="392.61" dur="7.47">patriotic why do we communicate this way</text>
  <text start="397.61" dur="3.88">well for the same reason because</text>
  <text start="400.08" dur="5.01">Patriots do not reveal classified</text>
  <text start="401.49" dur="5.399">information but they can ask questions</text>
  <text start="405.09" dur="3.9">and provide free information open-source</text>
  <text start="406.889" dur="3.661">information that we can all find and we</text>
  <text start="408.99" dur="2.929">could all kind of come to a consensus</text>
  <text start="410.55" dur="4.29">about what we want to do about it and</text>
  <text start="411.919" dur="4.72">then maybe we affect legislation or</text>
  <text start="414.84" dur="3.03">whether we whether we act in different</text>
  <text start="416.639" dur="2.661">ways by the way we spend our money or</text>
  <text start="417.87" dur="4.88">whatever we do it&amp;#39;s our choice and</text>
  <text start="419.3" dur="7.48">that&amp;#39;s a beautiful thing</text>
  <text start="422.75" dur="5.97">think for yourself good idea a good idea</text>
  <text start="426.78" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s not always easy</text>
  <text start="428.72" dur="4.39">Lari information to sift these days and</text>

  <text start="445.8" dur="4.29">titles and stuff like that but you know</text>
  <text start="447.72" dur="4.38">a lot of people love to embellish titles</text>
  <text start="450.09" dur="4.35">and say things it might not be true for</text>
  <text start="452.1" dur="3.6">the sake of getting some views and you</text>
  <text start="454.44" dur="2.76">know I suppose they&amp;#39;re free to do that</text>
  <text start="455.7" dur="5.4">right that&amp;#39;s that double-edged sword I</text>
  <text start="457.2" dur="4.98">was talking about but you know I guess</text>
