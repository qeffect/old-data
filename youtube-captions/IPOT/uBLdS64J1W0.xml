  <text start="127.82" dur="2.549">going to go way into this but let me</text>
  <text start="129.44" dur="2.79">just read you the first couple</text>
  <text start="130.369" dur="4.201">paragraphs here President Donald Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="132.23" dur="3.87">plans to allow the sale of a higher</text>
  <text start="134.57" dur="3.99">concentration of ethanol and gasoline</text>
  <text start="136.1" dur="4.56">throughout the year would appease us</text>
  <text start="138.56" dur="4.95">corn farmers who have been stung by low</text>
  <text start="140.66" dur="5.46">corn prices as a result of the us-china</text>
  <text start="143.51" dur="4.86">trade dispute and likely even lead to</text>
  <text start="146.12" dur="4.02">lower prices at the pump some refiners</text>
  <text start="148.37" dur="4.23">and older car engines however may pay</text>
  <text start="150.14" dur="4.11">the price Trump is expected to announce</text>
  <text start="152.6" dur="3.65">a directive later Tuesday that would</text>
  <text start="154.25" dur="5.25">allow the year-round sale of gasoline</text>
  <text start="156.25" dur="5.769">with up to fifteen percent ethanol also</text>
  <text start="159.5" dur="4.38">known as fifteen that would include the</text>

  <text start="166.01" dur="4.92">months it&amp;#39;s currently banned as it can</text>
  <text start="168.11" dur="4.89">produce more small okay so we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="170.93" dur="3.63">gonna talk a ton about this I&amp;#39;m not in</text>
  <text start="173" dur="4.739">love with this I wasn&amp;#39;t in love with it</text>
  <text start="174.56" dur="4.709">when we reported it but like I said back</text>
  <text start="177.739" dur="3.121">then it seemed like it was a bit of a</text>
  <text start="179.269" dur="3.78">stopgap and I think that&amp;#39;s really the</text>
  <text start="180.86" dur="4.8">point Trump is playing hardball</text>
  <text start="183.049" dur="4.651">on China and has been and this is kind</text>
  <text start="185.66" dur="3.389">of where it began when we started</text>
  <text start="187.7" dur="3.33">talking about tariffs and we started</text>
  <text start="189.049" dur="3.78">playing hardball all the way around but</text>
  <text start="191.03" dur="3.989">the people who have seemed to have been</text>
  <text start="192.829" dur="5.16">hurt the most really throughout this</text>
  <text start="195.019" dur="5.611">entire presidency has been our farmers</text>
  <text start="197.989" dur="4.441">and I&amp;#39;m not gonna begin to speak for our</text>
  <text start="200.63" dur="3.99">farmers but I want to point a few things</text>
  <text start="202.43" dur="4.17">out how I think this is all connected to</text>
  <text start="204.62" dur="3.48">the way China is playing hardball not</text>
  <text start="206.6" dur="4.229">just with us but particularly with us</text>
  <text start="208.1" dur="5.18">but globally and what this has to do</text>
  <text start="210.829" dur="6.211">with our alphabet agencies and our</text>
  <text start="213.28" dur="6.579">intelligence agencies FISA James Comey</text>
  <text start="217.04" dur="5.37">and all of that but we talked about in</text>
  <text start="219.859" dur="4.651">my last video how we have these Chinese</text>
  <text start="222.41" dur="4.799">guys who got arrested in Iowa</text>
  <text start="224.51" dur="5.339">in 2016 and this is one of the guys</text>
  <text start="227.209" dur="4.59">right here mall high lob who is on the</text>
  <text start="229.849" dur="4.17">right this is from the Los Angeles Times</text>
  <text start="231.799" dur="3.571">sorry I cut the title off there but we</text>
  <text start="234.019" dur="4.08">were talking about these Chinese guys</text>
  <text start="235.37" dur="5.429">who ended up getting two farms in Iowa</text>
  <text start="238.099" dur="4.761">seized they were taking these seeds and</text>
  <text start="240.799" dur="5.041">trying to fly them back to China these</text>
  <text start="242.86" dur="5.26">genetically modified seeds and this is a</text>
  <text start="245.84" dur="3.36">really really big industry here</text>
  <text start="248.12" dur="3.899">let me read you the first couple</text>
  <text start="249.2" dur="4.77">paragraphs here it was a chilly spring</text>
  <text start="252.019" dur="3.36">day when an Iowa farmer spotted</text>
  <text start="253.97" dur="3.78">something odd in his freshly planted</text>
  <text start="255.379" dur="4.771">cornfield a short bald Asian man on his</text>
  <text start="257.75" dur="5.55">knees digging up seeds not just any</text>
  <text start="260.15" dur="5.88">seeds special inbred seeds the product</text>
  <text start="263.3" dur="5.01">of years of secret research and millions</text>
  <text start="266.03" dur="4.169">of dollars in corporate investment so</text>
  <text start="268.31" dur="5.579">confidential that not even the farmer</text>
  <text start="270.199" dur="6.481">knew exactly what he was growing okay so</text>
  <text start="273.889" dur="4.141">I don&amp;#39;t want to go way back into this</text>
  <text start="276.68" dur="3.51">story again because we covered into my</text>
  <text start="278.03" dur="4.199">last video but I really want to remember</text>
  <text start="280.19" dur="4.38">idea the fact that this was really</text>
  <text start="282.229" dur="3.931">really big money being put into this and</text>
  <text start="284.57" dur="3.569">a lot of these people and these</text>
  <text start="286.16" dur="4.229">companies that are investing into this</text>
  <text start="288.139" dur="4.231">kind of stuff are the same people that</text>
  <text start="290.389" dur="5.46">are investing into surveillance</text>
  <text start="292.37" dur="6.479">technology and intelligence it&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="295.849" dur="5.13">big deal and even Q&amp;#39;s mentioning this</text>
  <text start="298.849" dur="4.231">and like I said I don&amp;#39;t really think</text>
  <text start="300.979" dur="4.47">this was a perfect thing adding more</text>
  <text start="303.08" dur="4.14">ethanol to the gas but it seemed like</text>
  <text start="305.449" dur="3.541">the only way that we could really really</text>
  <text start="307.22" dur="4.319">help our farmers out in this time of</text>
  <text start="308.99" dur="4.109">need now many of you out there are our</text>
  <text start="311.539" dur="3.69">farmers probably and you can probably</text>
  <text start="313.099" dur="4.261">tell me a little bit better how it has</text>
  <text start="315.229" dur="4.321">worked for you but at least that seems</text>
  <text start="317.36" dur="5.01">to be what I&amp;#39;m seeing from all this it</text>
  <text start="319.55" dur="4.44">was a way of trying to ease the pain on</text>
  <text start="322.37" dur="3">some of the people that we are really</text>
  <text start="323.99" dur="3.06">obviously some of the most important</text>
  <text start="325.37" dur="3.6">people on the planet right our farmers</text>
  <text start="327.05" dur="3.75">now let me take you down just a little</text>
  <text start="328.97" dur="3.36">bit further before we get off of this</text>
  <text start="330.8" dur="3.27">story because we&amp;#39;ve got a lot more to</text>
  <text start="332.33" dur="5.01">cover but I found this very interesting</text>
  <text start="334.07" dur="6.81">in this article that I didn&amp;#39;t see in the</text>
  <text start="337.34" dur="5.19">other articles which is right down yeah</text>
  <text start="340.88" dur="3.24">now this is talking about the raid</text>
  <text start="342.53" dur="3.69">itself and this is something that I</text>
  <text start="344.12" dur="2.76">missed in the other articles after the</text>
  <text start="346.22" dur="4.77">men left</text>
  <text start="346.88" dur="7.11">agents swept in they discovered 42 bags</text>
  <text start="350.99" dur="5.46">of hybrid seeds in the boxes each bag</text>
  <text start="353.99" dur="3.859">was marked with its own code presumably</text>
  <text start="356.45" dur="4.279">to help identify</text>
  <text start="357.849" dur="4.74">with the contraband the FBI replaced the</text>
  <text start="360.729" dur="4.59">seeds with other already commercially</text>
  <text start="362.589" dur="3.6">available in China and shipped them on</text>
  <text start="365.319" dur="4.261">their way</text>
  <text start="366.189" dur="7.47">okay so forty two bags and each bag had</text>
  <text start="369.58" dur="5.849">its own code forty two bags alright</text>
  <text start="373.659" dur="3.57">let&amp;#39;s move off of this for now okay so</text>
  <text start="375.429" dur="3.75">again I want to remind you if you&amp;#39;ve not</text>
  <text start="377.229" dur="4.14">seen my previous video entitled crack</text>
  <text start="379.179" dur="3.78">corn please do because so much of this</text>
  <text start="381.369" dur="3.211">will set up for what we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="382.959" dur="3.93">here but at this point in the video</text>
  <text start="384.58" dur="4.259">all I really want to establish is the</text>
  <text start="386.889" dur="4.23">fact that we knew there were Chinese</text>
  <text start="388.839" dur="4.56">nationals and many of them in different</text>
  <text start="391.119" dur="4.02">locations around the country that were</text>
  <text start="393.399" dur="4.56">messing with our seeds they were trying</text>
  <text start="395.139" dur="4.86">to get our seeds and then send them over</text>
  <text start="397.959" dur="4.74">to China and whatever the process was</text>
  <text start="399.999" dur="5.4">was obviously illegal this drew the</text>
  <text start="402.699" dur="5.19">attention of the FBI but not just the</text>
  <text start="405.399" dur="4.681">FBI the intelligence agencies and then</text>
  <text start="407.889" dur="4.29">there was some really really funky FISA</text>
  <text start="410.08" dur="3.809">warrants being put out and of course</text>
  <text start="412.179" dur="3.24">we&amp;#39;re all familiar with FISA warrants</text>
  <text start="413.889" dur="4.32">because it&amp;#39;s all over the news right now</text>
  <text start="415.419" dur="5.191">right so this was a really really big</text>
  <text start="418.209" dur="4.77">deal involving seeds and don&amp;#39;t kid</text>
  <text start="420.61" dur="6.779">yourself these seeds are extremely</text>
  <text start="422.979" dur="7.02">important it&amp;#39;s a huge business but for</text>
  <text start="427.389" dur="4.98">now I want to take what seems to be a</text>
  <text start="429.999" dur="4.44">slight term we are on the New York Times</text>
  <text start="432.369" dur="4.26">now and I want to say thanks to whom I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="434.439" dur="3.87">gonna call cloud and on for sending me</text>
  <text start="436.629" dur="3.99">this article that I remember seeing and</text>
  <text start="438.309" dur="3.75">didn&amp;#39;t read and I&amp;#39;m so glad that you</text>

  <text start="450.569" dur="5.62">over the past few months a fierce debate</text>
  <text start="453.669" dur="4.441">has erupted in Silicon Valley over</text>

  <text start="659.07" dur="3.6">that will be worth as much as 10 million</text>
  <text start="661.02" dur="3.42">dollars to the winning bidder okay so</text>
  <text start="662.67" dur="4.17">that is a big deal and I&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="664.44" dur="4.74">this a lot in particular back when James</text>
  <text start="666.84" dur="4.8">clapper when he was the DNI he gave an</text>

  <text start="671.64" dur="3.69">these other players were all in play for</text>
  <text start="673.41" dur="3.72">it and they were thinking that everybody</text>
  <text start="675.33" dur="4.74">was gonna get a little piece but instead</text>
  <text start="677.13" dur="5.01">Amazon got the whole thing now it&amp;#39;s open</text>
  <text start="680.07" dur="4.77">again and that&amp;#39;s how it should be of</text>
  <text start="682.14" dur="5.449">course but this is known as project Jedi</text>
  <text start="684.84" dur="5.07">which is the joint enterprise defense</text>
  <text start="687.589" dur="3.671">intelligence and the reason why I</text>
  <text start="689.91" dur="3.12">thought this was so important especially</text>
  <text start="691.26" dur="2.55">back in the day is coz keep in mind</text>
  <text start="693.03" dur="1.89">Amazon</text>

  <text start="700.38" dur="5.82">Department Intel but remember Jeff Bezos</text>
  <text start="702.93" dur="5.76">also owns the Washington Post so these</text>
  <text start="706.2" dur="5.31">people who have access to your data and</text>

  <text start="712.86" dur="4.59">to the people so this is some sketchy</text>
  <text start="715.23" dur="3.33">stuff and something that I think we</text>
  <text start="717.45" dur="4.05">should be paying attention to</text>
  <text start="718.56" dur="5.7">but this Jedi is also a reference to the</text>

  <text start="746.41" dur="5.31">to light well I imagine the IQ might be</text>
  <text start="749.44" dur="4.5">nodding to the select but maybe when you</text>
  <text start="751.72" dur="3.45">actually go to this Star Wars game you</text>
  <text start="753.94" dur="3.36">can select whether you want to be the</text>

  <text start="767.05" dur="4.92">good guys and they&amp;#39;re rebelling against</text>

  <text start="808.51" dur="2.73">here is a blown-up picture I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="810.1" dur="3.15">to point out that those toys are very</text>
  <text start="811.24" dur="4.11">neatly arranged that&amp;#39;s not like how a</text>
  <text start="813.25" dur="4.079">kid usually does it and they&amp;#39;re kind of</text>
  <text start="815.35" dur="3.57">like an intact formation and it&amp;#39;s aimed</text>
  <text start="817.329" dur="3.181">at this little footstool here which is</text>
  <text start="818.92" dur="4.409">known as a Hasek that was the word I was</text>
  <text start="820.51" dur="4.559">looking for Hasek you can call it an</text>

  <text start="825.069" dur="1.981">whatever I don&amp;#39;t care what you call it</text>
  <text start="826.389" dur="3.031">anyway</text>
  <text start="827.05" dur="5.099">but I don&amp;#39;t point out that these toys</text>
  <text start="829.42" dur="4.229">here are all part of the Rebel Alliance</text>
  <text start="832.149" dur="3.18">you could see in the middle there</text>
  <text start="833.649" dur="3.3">there&amp;#39;s the Millennium Falcon now it was</text>
  <text start="835.329" dur="3.24">Han Solo those little get up and then</text>
  <text start="836.949" dur="3.63">you got an x-wing fighter right there at</text>
  <text start="838.569" dur="3.33">Luke Skywalker blue one of those and</text>
  <text start="840.579" dur="2.88">then of course you got this little robot</text>
  <text start="841.899" dur="4.05">thing I don&amp;#39;t remember its name it was</text>
  <text start="843.459" dur="4.5">basically like hey did you like r2d2</text>

  <text start="847.959" dur="4.201">orange rolling baller be patoot but</text>
  <text start="850.75" dur="3.87">anyway the point I really want to make</text>
  <text start="852.16" dur="5.669">is lined up in front are sort of their</text>
  <text start="854.62" dur="5.14">heroes which is the Jedi faction and of</text>
  <text start="857.829" dur="4.391">course they&amp;#39;re sort of the</text>
  <text start="859.76" dur="5.1">is the wizard warriors if you will but</text>
  <text start="862.22" dur="4.71">they are the Jedi so it looks like we</text>
  <text start="864.86" dur="4.86">are referencing Jedi and of course we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="866.93" dur="4.11">referencing James nobodies homie Comey</text>
  <text start="869.72" dur="3.21">if you have been following my channel</text>
  <text start="871.04" dur="3.81">you may also remember that I was sort of</text>
  <text start="872.93" dur="3.87">theorizing that the toys were arranged</text>
  <text start="874.85" dur="4.71">sort of in an attack formation with the</text>
  <text start="876.8" dur="5.55">Jedi in front and they were aimed at</text>
  <text start="879.56" dur="5.31">this Hasek Ottoman whatever footstool</text>
  <text start="882.35" dur="4.8">but either way it looked like this thing</text>
  <text start="884.87" dur="3.75">was representing the Death Star if</text>
  <text start="887.15" dur="4.11">you&amp;#39;ve watched the movie the Death Star</text>
  <text start="888.62" dur="5.13">is an actual star it&amp;#39;s like a base that</text>
  <text start="891.26" dur="4.44">the evil empire has been working on and</text>
  <text start="893.75" dur="3.24">the Rebel Alliance is trying to take it</text>
  <text start="895.7" dur="3.06">down it looked like they were all in</text>
  <text start="896.99" dur="4.26">attack formation well it looks like</text>
  <text start="898.76" dur="4.35">maybe Ivanka Trump was picking up what I</text>
  <text start="901.25" dur="4.98">was putting down because she tweeted</text>
  <text start="903.11" dur="5.55">this on September 29th the force is</text>

  <text start="924.14" dur="4.29">Ivanka is saying why I guess that makes</text>
  <text start="925.88" dur="4.17">us the evil empire and of course you can</text>
  <text start="928.43" dur="3.39">see one of their kids they&amp;#39;re dressed up</text>
  <text start="930.05" dur="4.83">as a stormtrooper and the stormtrooper</text>
  <text start="931.82" dur="5.52">of course is part of the evil empire but</text>
  <text start="934.88" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t worry he&amp;#39;s probably harmless not</text>
  <text start="937.34" dur="2.7">because he&amp;#39;s a kid but because he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="938.6" dur="4.02">stormtrooper and they don&amp;#39;t ever hit</text>

  <text start="946.4" dur="4.71">will you just chill out for a second</text>
  <text start="948.29" dur="4.98">because I&amp;#39;m getting to it in 1965 Dow</text>

  <text start="971.6" dur="5.28">Dow is not known as a defense contractor</text>
  <text start="974.57" dur="3.6">in fact until its Pentagon contract the</text>

  <text start="997.57" dur="4.86">sights on the company okay I talked a</text>
  <text start="999.97" dur="4.77">little bit about this yesterday in a in</text>
  <text start="1002.43" dur="5.01">reference to Monsanto which like Dow was</text>
  <text start="1004.74" dur="5.159">also working and dabbling in the defense</text>
  <text start="1007.44" dur="4.649">they had been working on ancient orange</text>

  <text start="1015.899" dur="3.511">Vietnam now I want to move down here</text>
  <text start="1018.42" dur="2.22">because what this is kind of talking</text>

  <text start="1027.51" dur="4.89">fly under the radar but then they start</text>
  <text start="1030.329" dur="3.571">to equate this with big tech which is</text>
  <text start="1032.4" dur="3.99">what I really want to talk about right</text>
  <text start="1033.9" dur="5.49">here tech companies aren&amp;#39;t making things</text>
  <text start="1036.39" dur="4.77">as obviously harmful as napalm in fact</text>

  <text start="1401.17" dur="6.27">big-time donators to the Clintons and of</text>
  <text start="1404.29" dur="6.03">course this was going down again in 2016</text>
  <text start="1407.44" dur="5.1">right so keep in mind that all this was</text>
  <text start="1410.32" dur="4.35">happening right around the same time and</text>
  <text start="1412.54" dur="4.05">of course remember that part of this</text>
  <text start="1414.67" dur="4.44">whole thing about Hillary&amp;#39;s emails is</text>

  <text start="1441.91" dur="4.23">money off of Monsanto that was more</text>
  <text start="1444.16" dur="3.51">directly related to Hillary Clinton but</text>

  <text start="1672.73" dur="3.899">related or not because we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="1675.039" dur="3.151">show up with lots of different people</text>
  <text start="1676.629" dur="3.51">now and of course a lot of you guys are</text>
  <text start="1678.19" dur="3.239">starting to pull these out and I think</text>
  <text start="1680.139" dur="3.42">at some point we&amp;#39;ll probably do a video</text>
  <text start="1681.429" dur="6.12">on that too whether it&amp;#39;s John Polk</text>
  <text start="1683.559" dur="6.18">cuesta or Joe B Dan or what not James</text>
  <text start="1687.549" dur="3.96">corny we&amp;#39;re starting to see this with</text>
  <text start="1689.739" dur="3.601">all kinds of names and I think we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1691.509" dur="3.42">probably let some of that sift out and</text>
  <text start="1693.34" dur="3.6">figure out what it is we&amp;#39;re they</text>
  <text start="1694.929" dur="3.84">avoiding FOIA requests were they simply</text>
  <text start="1696.94" dur="3.989">trying to just give themselves some</text>
  <text start="1698.769" dur="4.62">culpable deniability saying hey that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1700.929" dur="5.791">not me I don&amp;#39;t know who James 8 corny is</text>
  <text start="1703.389" dur="5.01">don&amp;#39;t know but I find this statement</text>
  <text start="1706.72" dur="4.319">from Devon newness to be very curious</text>
  <text start="1708.399" dur="5.941">about for to be cut it seems like the</text>
  <text start="1711.039" dur="6">corn is a very very big deal and it</text>
  <text start="1714.34" dur="4.169">seems like China thinks it&amp;#39;s a very big</text>
  <text start="1717.039" dur="3.421">deal - as a matter of fact all these</text>
  <text start="1718.509" dur="4.05">nations are putting tons of money into</text>
  <text start="1720.46" dur="5.159">these crazy seeds and of course that got</text>
  <text start="1722.559" dur="4.74">me thinking wondering if this 42 B has</text>
  <text start="1725.619" dur="6.15">something to do with the modification</text>
  <text start="1727.299" dur="6.931">itself now this is a from a research</text>
  <text start="1731.769" dur="3.87">from that was done in Brazil and I just</text>
  <text start="1734.23" dur="3.659">want to take you down this was done in</text>
  <text start="1735.639" dur="5.341">the 90s in regards to all kinds of</text>
  <text start="1737.889" dur="5.071">different I should I say bio fertilizer</text>
  <text start="1740.98" dur="5.039">and whatnot but I want to show you this</text>
  <text start="1742.96" dur="4.74">graphic right here you can see right in</text>
  <text start="1746.019" dur="4.14">the middle you have tomato PD pepper</text>
  <text start="1747.7" dur="4.439">cucumber beef burdock carrot bean and</text>
  <text start="1750.159" dur="3.9">then of course corn and then talking</text>
  <text start="1752.139" dur="4.02">about germination percentage with</text>
  <text start="1754.059" dur="3.421">percentage seed germination for selected</text>
  <text start="1756.159" dur="5.161">crops treated with effective</text>
  <text start="1757.48" dur="5.61">microorganisms and a bio fertilizer okay</text>
  <text start="1761.32" dur="5.969">so the one being used on the corn here</text>
  <text start="1763.09" dur="5.309">we have a 94 a and a 79 B and a 72 B so</text>
  <text start="1767.289" dur="2.911">it leads me to think if we have a</text>
  <text start="1768.399" dur="4.11">setting on B we have a 72 B probably</text>
  <text start="1770.2" dur="3.689">have a 42 B right and we do they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1772.509" dur="4.89">using it on the pepper right there you</text>
  <text start="1773.889" dur="5.64">see the bio fertilizer 42 B so is this a</text>
  <text start="1777.399" dur="5.34">reference to something being used on our</text>
  <text start="1779.529" dur="6.21">crops our corn our four to B is the corn</text>
  <text start="1782.739" dur="4.8">four to be cut I&amp;#39;m not sure I&amp;#39;ve gotten</text>
  <text start="1785.739" dur="3.901">a lot of emails from you guys saying</text>
  <text start="1787.539" dur="5.581">that there is a particular four</text>
  <text start="1789.64" dur="5.49">to be strain of corn that was being used</text>
  <text start="1793.12" dur="4.23">at the Ohio University and I believe</text>
  <text start="1795.13" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s your Ohio University not Ohio State</text>
  <text start="1797.35" dur="5.34">University I have not seen that just yet</text>
  <text start="1800.38" dur="4.5">I&amp;#39;ve gotten multiple email saying that</text>
  <text start="1802.69" dur="4.05">it exists but I&amp;#39;ve yet to see it so if</text>
  <text start="1804.88" dur="3.6">you have any concrete evidence of that I</text>
  <text start="1806.74" dur="3.96">would love to see that that might clear</text>
  <text start="1808.48" dur="5.34">up some answers but it does appear that</text>
  <text start="1810.7" dur="6.72">this for to be seems to be very specific</text>
  <text start="1813.82" dur="6.12">corn for to be cut and I&amp;#39;ve just shown</text>
  <text start="1817.42" dur="4.62">you a forty two billion dollar merger</text>
  <text start="1819.94" dur="5.7">and a lot of this had to do with our</text>
  <text start="1822.04" dur="5.49">42nd president forty to be and of course</text>
  <text start="1825.64" dur="4.529">these Chinese nationals were arrested</text>
  <text start="1827.53" dur="5.07">with forty two bags and they were all</text>
  <text start="1830.169" dur="5.25">individually marked maybe one of them</text>
  <text start="1832.6" dur="4.62">was a forty two be you guys can let me</text>
  <text start="1835.419" dur="3.991">know down below but that&amp;#39;s what I have</text>
  <text start="1837.22" dur="3.54">for you on this part of it so far all</text>
  <text start="1839.41" dur="3.24">right Patriots that&amp;#39;s all I got for you</text>
  <text start="1840.76" dur="4.32">for now just a few connections and what</text>
  <text start="1842.65" dur="4.92">appears to be myriad of connections for</text>
  <text start="1845.08" dur="3.719">to be made I do want to clarify that</text>
  <text start="1847.57" dur="3.57">although we didn&amp;#39;t cover the</text>
  <text start="1848.799" dur="4.231">misspellings much today we probably will</text>
  <text start="1851.14" dur="4.08">at a later date I&amp;#39;d like to see more of</text>
  <text start="1853.03" dur="4.44">these pop up before we really do any</text>
  <text start="1855.22" dur="3.449">deep digging on it but it clearly seems</text>
  <text start="1857.47" dur="3.36">like something is up when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1858.669" dur="4.291">spelling the name James Comey like James</text>
  <text start="1860.83" dur="4.71">eight corny there&amp;#39;s clearly something</text>
  <text start="1862.96" dur="4.32">going on and Q has highlighted this Q is</text>
  <text start="1865.54" dur="4.769">also mentioned that misspellings matter</text>
  <text start="1867.28" dur="5.279">so indeed they do but Q is also</text>
  <text start="1870.309" dur="3.961">mentioned ethanol and China in regards</text>
  <text start="1872.559" dur="3.451">to this corn reference which leads me to</text>
  <text start="1874.27" dur="3.42">think that although maybe we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1876.01" dur="3.72">nailed this quite on the head we are</text>
  <text start="1877.69" dur="3.33">probably in the ballpark after all it</text>
  <text start="1879.73" dur="3.6">does appear that we are talking about</text>
  <text start="1881.02" dur="4.289">the state of Iowa and of course people</text>
  <text start="1883.33" dur="4.229">like Devin Nunez and Chuck Grassley who</text>
  <text start="1885.309" dur="4.201">reside in Iowa are the ones tweeting</text>
  <text start="1887.559" dur="4.62">about the corn and of course so is James</text>
  <text start="1889.51" dur="4.83">nobody&amp;#39;s home Eko me and we saw a direct</text>
  <text start="1892.179" dur="4.411">connections with James commis FBI and</text>
  <text start="1894.34" dur="4.8">Chinese nationals in the state of Iowa</text>
  <text start="1896.59" dur="5.13">and the corn and the AI and the Jedi and</text>
  <text start="1899.14" dur="5.279">all that so I think that we are probably</text>
  <text start="1901.72" dur="4.86">pretty close let me also turn you on to</text>
  <text start="1904.419" dur="3.901">this little graphic here from AG reliant</text>
  <text start="1906.58" dur="4.44">genetics I just turn this up in my</text>
  <text start="1908.32" dur="5.37">search when I was looking up 42 B and I</text>
  <text start="1911.02" dur="5.94">found this from October 2018 now they</text>
  <text start="1913.69" dur="4.71">were launching 42 new corn hybrids so</text>
  <text start="1916.96" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;m not sure if we&amp;#39;ve nailed it on the</text>
  <text start="1918.4" dur="4.77">head but we might be somewhere close</text>
  <text start="1920.8" dur="3.93">also remember that Devin Nunez</text>
  <text start="1923.17" dur="3.9">did that picture of what looked to be</text>
  <text start="1924.73" dur="4.95">old corn corn like that would likely get</text>
  <text start="1927.07" dur="4.74">ground up and to feed maybe feed for</text>
  <text start="1929.68" dur="4.56">chickens maybe even feed for those</text>
  <text start="1931.81" dur="4.98">chickens in Arkansas Bill Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1934.24" dur="4.71">Tyson chickens I don&amp;#39;t know another side</text>
  <text start="1936.79" dur="4.35">note with Bill Clinton his deal with</text>
  <text start="1938.95" dur="3.78">Boris Yeltsin that was a part of a much</text>
  <text start="1941.14" dur="4.11">bigger deal that involved a lot of</text>
  <text start="1942.73" dur="4.89">suspected drug rings prostitution rings</text>
  <text start="1945.25" dur="4.65">and the like but one of the facilitators</text>
  <text start="1947.62" dur="3.96">of that whole thing was a friend of Bill</text>
  <text start="1949.9" dur="4.74">Clinton&amp;#39;s and I believe at the time was</text>
  <text start="1951.58" dur="5.13">Deputy Secretary of State strobe Talbott</text>
  <text start="1954.64" dur="3.78">and he comes from a long line of</text>
  <text start="1956.71" dur="4.23">knuckleheads strobe Talbott was a</text>
  <text start="1958.42" dur="4.83">suspected KGB agent and he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1960.94" dur="4.02">descendant of Harold Talbott who is</text>
  <text start="1963.25" dur="5.28">another one of these guys who is a</text>
