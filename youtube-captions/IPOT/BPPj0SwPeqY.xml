  <text start="515.329" dur="4.14">so we talking this D five wrapped up in</text>
  <text start="517.76" dur="4.17">one through six it would seem to be</text>
  <text start="519.469" dur="5.36">right D one through six is this one</text>
  <text start="521.93" dur="5.61">through six people one through six</text>

  <text start="531.05" dur="6.3">listed four steps and four steps alone</text>
  <text start="534.77" dur="4.11">very curious now like I said the one</text>

  <text start="538.88" dur="4.32">different things I&amp;#39;m guessing it may</text>
  <text start="541.01" dur="4.2">refer to people and queue probably knows</text>
  <text start="543.2" dur="3.72">that they know who they are so it might</text>
  <text start="545.21" dur="3.75">be a communication going back and forth</text>
  <text start="546.92" dur="4.29">I could also be wrong on that but I</text>
  <text start="548.96" dur="4.98">think we get the general idea we do know</text>
  <text start="551.21" dur="5.13">that one person involved doesn&amp;#39;t seem to</text>
  <text start="553.94" dur="4.26">want to face the music and it looks like</text>

  <text start="1313.2" dur="5.04">situation when he was heading to the</text>
  <text start="1315.06" dur="5.16">summit in Singapore with North Korea we</text>
  <text start="1318.24" dur="4.53">suspected that there was even a missile</text>
  <text start="1320.22" dur="4.56">attack on Air Force One so really really</text>
  <text start="1322.77" dur="4.38">scary stuff and this kind of stuff is</text>
  <text start="1324.78" dur="4.54">extremely scary number one it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="1327.15" dur="4">scary that POTUS is you know kind of</text>
  <text start="1329.32" dur="3.27">we all know the rumors about the diet</text>
  <text start="1331.15" dur="3.36">coke and the McDonald&amp;#39;s and whatnot</text>
  <text start="1332.59" dur="3.48">which is essentially poison anyway but</text>
  <text start="1334.51" dur="3.75">this might be his best option</text>
  <text start="1336.07" dur="4.14">considering what he&amp;#39;s got to go through</text>
  <text start="1338.26" dur="5.67">but either way our thoughts and prayers</text>
  <text start="1340.21" dur="6.45">to the POTUS now this is what he had to</text>
  <text start="1343.93" dur="4.32">say in regards to the incident I went</text>
  <text start="1346.66" dur="5.43">for a physical on Saturday</text>
  <text start="1348.25" dur="6.18">my wife said because I had some extra</text>

  <text start="1402.1" dur="4.38">hospital for a little while I was out of</text>
  <text start="1404.17" dur="4.38">there very quickly I got that call and I</text>
  <text start="1406.48" dur="4.26">get greeted with the news that we</text>
  <text start="1408.55" dur="5.61">understand you had a heart attack I was</text>
  <text start="1410.74" dur="7.56">called by our people in public relations</text>
  <text start="1414.16" dur="6.27">sir are you okay I said okay for one the</text>
  <text start="1418.3" dur="4.17">word is you had a heart attack CNN said</text>
  <text start="1420.43" dur="4.23">you may have had a heart attack you had</text>
  <text start="1422.47" dur="6.09">massive chest pains you went to the</text>
  <text start="1424.66" dur="7.32">hospital these people are sick they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1428.56" dur="7.239">sick and the press really in this</text>
  <text start="1431.98" dur="5.559">is dangerous we don&amp;#39;t have freedom of</text>
  <text start="1435.799" dur="4.38">the press in this country we have the</text>
  <text start="1437.539" dur="6">opposite we have a very corrupt media</text>
  <text start="1440.179" dur="5.911">and I hope they can get their act</text>
  <text start="1443.539" dur="8.281">straight now because it&amp;#39;s very very bad</text>
  <text start="1446.09" dur="7.559">and very very dangerous so there you go</text>
  <text start="1451.82" dur="3.39">pota it&amp;#39;s obviously downplaying the</text>
  <text start="1453.649" dur="3.66">incident maybe it wasn&amp;#39;t a big deal</text>
  <text start="1455.21" dur="4.65">after all but it sure seems like</text>
  <text start="1457.309" dur="5.131">something to be concerned about</text>
  <text start="1459.86" dur="4.5">after all we already know how badly the</text>
  <text start="1462.44" dur="3.81">fake news media would love to report</text>
  <text start="1464.36" dur="3.96">some news like that and I think at this</text>
  <text start="1466.25" dur="3.899">point we already know how treasonous</text>
  <text start="1468.32" dur="3.359">they are so we shouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised</text>
  <text start="1470.149" dur="3.721">the way they&amp;#39;re reporting things and</text>
  <text start="1471.679" dur="4.83">that&amp;#39;s exactly why I&amp;#39;m over here on CNN</text>
  <text start="1473.87" dur="4.679">because Trump also went after Hillary</text>
  <text start="1476.509" dur="4.861">Clinton playing with Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="1478.549" dur="4.681">aboard returns to gay after mechanical</text>
