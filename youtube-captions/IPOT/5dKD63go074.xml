  <text start="298.18" dur="3.39">posts are important let&amp;#39;s break this</text>
  <text start="300.16" dur="4.86">down we&amp;#39;re gonna go right back to the</text>
  <text start="301.57" dur="4.98">first one here well why did Kim travel</text>
  <text start="305.02" dur="4.32">to China well we have a few theories</text>
  <text start="306.55" dur="4.11">there we know that Kim doesn&amp;#39;t travel</text>
  <text start="309.34" dur="3.9">much all right</text>
  <text start="310.66" dur="4.95">why was travel impossible in the past</text>
  <text start="313.24" dur="5.1">well because quite honestly he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="315.61" dur="4.41">just first of all the US has tons of</text>
  <text start="318.34" dur="3.81">embargoes on North Korea so it makes</text>
  <text start="320.02" dur="4.74">travel very difficult makes it costly</text>
  <text start="322.15" dur="4.14">and not to mention kim jeong-hoon it</text>
  <text start="324.76" dur="3.36">were not the only country he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="326.29" dur="5.75">friends with there are tons of countries</text>
  <text start="328.12" dur="6.63">other than maybe I would say Syria Egypt</text>
  <text start="332.04" dur="4.81">there&amp;#39;s not many China there&amp;#39;s not many</text>
  <text start="334.75" dur="3.87">places he can go without people that are</text>
  <text start="336.85" dur="3.81">really really trying to kill him so it</text>
  <text start="338.62" dur="4.11">doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense and considering</text>
  <text start="340.66" dur="3.81">that they&amp;#39;re sort of off on their own</text>
  <text start="342.73" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re sort of autonomous if you will</text>
  <text start="344.47" dur="4.83">nobody really deals with them and so</text>
  <text start="346.45" dur="4.62">there&amp;#39;s no real diplomatic reasons to</text>
  <text start="349.3" dur="3.63">actually go and it&amp;#39;s dangerous</text>
  <text start="351.07" dur="4.11">why did Kim travel to China I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="352.93" dur="4.38">assume he needs help he that needs help</text>
  <text start="355.18" dur="3.57">he wants to surrender something he wants</text>
  <text start="357.31" dur="5.22">to give something over but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.75" dur="5.55">clearly a reason why why he&amp;#39;s over there</text>
  <text start="362.53" dur="3.27">and now there&amp;#39;s a lot of theories saying</text>
  <text start="364.3" dur="3.12">that he&amp;#39;s already been deposed and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="365.8" dur="3.42">just kind of basically a paper tiger at</text>
  <text start="367.42" dur="3.75">this at this point and I tend to agree I</text>
  <text start="369.22" dur="4.74">think that&amp;#39;s really what&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="371.17" dur="4.56">gonna be end up proving to be true what</text>
  <text start="373.96" dur="5.49">constitutes the need for a face-to-face</text>
  <text start="375.73" dur="4.8">meeting for a secured call well and you</text>
  <text start="379.45" dur="3.6">listen what I just said that that</text>
  <text start="380.53" dur="4.32">constitutes the need if somebody wants</text>
  <text start="383.05" dur="3.51">to kill him he needs to go straight to</text>
  <text start="384.85" dur="3.63">China straight to someplace where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="386.56" dur="3.69">going to be you know protected and as</text>
  <text start="388.48" dur="3.63">you saw you saw the Train you saw the</text>
  <text start="390.25" dur="3.45">video he saw the people gardening well</text>
  <text start="392.11" dur="3.78">you can see this is still a head of</text>
  <text start="393.7" dur="4.47">state here and now</text>
  <text start="395.89" dur="5.4">could he be surrounding nuclear codes</text>
  <text start="398.17" dur="5.1">could he be surrendering people as to</text>
  <text start="401.29" dur="2.61">the organizations that propped him up in</text>
  <text start="403.27" dur="1.31">the first place</text>
  <text start="403.9" dur="2.48">the</text>
  <text start="404.58" dur="3.21">ladder seems to be where I would be</text>
  <text start="406.38" dur="2.82">interested in but it could be a number</text>
  <text start="407.79" dur="3.18">of things in which you know you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="409.2" dur="3.75">me if you if you&amp;#39;re turning over nuclear</text>

  <text start="1251.5" dur="4.62">the swamp we always knew final stage</text>
  <text start="1254.95" dur="3.72">should be bigger</text>
  <text start="1256.12" dur="7.92">what does North Korea represent I would</text>
  <text start="1258.67" dur="10.56">assume the exposure of the of the CIA</text>
  <text start="1264.04" dur="7.83">and the defunding of these sort of</text>
  <text start="1269.23" dur="4.26">puppet regimes who now need to start</text>
  <text start="1271.87" dur="3.18">kind of coming down and getting exposed</text>
  <text start="1273.49" dur="4.56">so that we can see who the real real</text>
  <text start="1275.05" dur="6.09">enemy is here threat safeguard insurance</text>
  <text start="1278.05" dur="4.59">poof as if they were gone Kim to China</text>
  <text start="1281.14" dur="3.78">represents something vital yeah I think</text>
  <text start="1282.64" dur="4.08">it does I think it really it kind of</text>
  <text start="1284.92" dur="3.27">represents the the surrender of these</text>
  <text start="1286.72" dur="4.11">regimes and I think we&amp;#39;re going to see a</text>
  <text start="1288.19" dur="3.69">similar situation in Iran I really do I</text>
  <text start="1290.83" dur="2.79">think it&amp;#39;s going to get really really</text>

  <text start="1296.47" dur="4.62">think all told I think it&amp;#39;s gonna turn</text>
  <text start="1298.9" dur="4.44">out the same way many will be buried</text>
  <text start="1301.09" dur="4.74">before exposed well if it&amp;#39;s CIA they are</text>
  <text start="1303.34" dur="4.56">not going to go down Rothschilds funded</text>
  <text start="1305.83" dur="3.24">they are not gonna go down I imagine</text>
  <text start="1307.9" dur="4.41">many of them would rather just off</text>
  <text start="1309.07" dur="5.37">themselves and then you know expose</text>
  <text start="1312.31" dur="3.96">themselves and find themselves in trial</text>
