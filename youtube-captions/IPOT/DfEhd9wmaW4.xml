  <text start="195.76" dur="3.72">brandishing the tusks and ran towards</text>
  <text start="198.13" dur="3.93">the attacker as he threatened to</text>
  <text start="199.48" dur="2.91">detonate his device a co-worker told the</text>
  <text start="202.06" dur="3.45">paper</text>

  <text start="213.82" dur="3.96">and here right here is a picture and I</text>
  <text start="216.76" dur="3.75">guess this is from</text>
  <text start="217.78" dur="4.14">fish mongers halt nearby as you can see</text>
  <text start="220.51" dur="4.05">there&amp;#39;s the Tusk right there so he just</text>
  <text start="221.92" dur="3.36">ran in there grabbed himself a tusk went</text>
  <text start="224.56" dur="2.43">back out</text>
  <text start="225.28" dur="3.33">Norwalk all right so let&amp;#39;s check out</text>
  <text start="226.99" dur="4.32">some of this video here this first one</text>
  <text start="228.61" dur="6">is courtesy of the Toronto Sun and we</text>
  <text start="231.31" dur="5.46">open with another vertical video and</text>
  <text start="234.61" dur="4.08">this appears to be around the corner now</text>
  <text start="236.77" dur="3.39">what&amp;#39;s strange to me is that this must</text>
  <text start="238.69" dur="3.06">have going on long enough for the person</text>
  <text start="240.16" dur="3.78">to have presence of mind to grab their</text>
  <text start="241.75" dur="4.41">camera and film even though it is</text>
  <text start="243.94" dur="3.84">vertical from around the corner so there</text>
  <text start="246.16" dur="3.63">must have been a bunch of hubbub it says</text>
  <text start="247.78" dur="4.17">caught on camera whale tusks stops</text>
  <text start="249.79" dur="3.57">London Bridge attacker and you see</text>
  <text start="251.95" dur="3.09">people starting to book it around the</text>
  <text start="253.36" dur="3.659">corner alright so I&amp;#39;m assuming whatever</text>
  <text start="255.04" dur="3.75">it is is up and to the right now let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="257.019" dur="4.321">open up here on the left you see a</text>
  <text start="258.79" dur="4.14">picture of our attacker and it looks to</text>
  <text start="261.34" dur="2.88">me like two knives I&amp;#39;m not really sure</text>
  <text start="262.93" dur="2.67">what&amp;#39;s on the left hand there but it</text>
  <text start="264.22" dur="4.32">looks pretty certain that that is a</text>
  <text start="265.6" dur="5.73">knife in the right hand now on the right</text>
  <text start="268.54" dur="4.95">side we see the initial attack the guys</text>
  <text start="271.33" dur="4.53">on the bridge and we see the guys</text>
  <text start="273.49" dur="5.13">approaching here and the guys like oh no</text>
  <text start="275.86" dur="4.65">is that potassium carbonate wait a</text>
  <text start="278.62" dur="3.39">minute is that it so well tusks</text>
  <text start="280.51" dur="2.67">he&amp;#39;s already just stunned that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="282.01" dur="3.3">probably what brought him in the grounds</text>
  <text start="283.18" dur="4.23">take a look at it again he said oh no I</text>
  <text start="285.31" dur="3.72">can&amp;#39;t handle the foam I can&amp;#39;t handle the</text>
  <text start="287.41" dur="3.21">foam is that dont whale tusks and then</text>
  <text start="289.03" dur="4.11">the guy grabs him looks like the guy</text>
  <text start="290.62" dur="5.07">right here grabs him by his arm and then</text>
  <text start="293.14" dur="4.14">he maybe tries to protect the knife in</text>
  <text start="295.69" dur="2.94">his hand and then kind of gets swung to</text>
  <text start="297.28" dur="3.57">the ground that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m seeing right</text>
  <text start="298.63" dur="4.11">there but they continue to spray and of</text>
  <text start="300.85" dur="4.02">course Narwhal guy right here is just</text>
  <text start="302.74" dur="4.23">kind of fending him off he almost looks</text>
  <text start="304.87" dur="3.81">like he&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s that sport artist</text>
  <text start="306.97" dur="2.28">curling he&amp;#39;s doing the curling that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="308.68" dur="1.89">what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="309.25" dur="3.06">anyway they wrestle him to the ground</text>
  <text start="310.57" dur="3.03">with some foam and if you&amp;#39;ve ever been</text>
  <text start="312.31" dur="3.12">sprayed by that foam you&amp;#39;ll know that</text>
  <text start="313.6" dur="3.54">it&amp;#39;s just foam it really doesn&amp;#39;t do any</text>
  <text start="315.43" dur="3.21">anything it&amp;#39;s just really to confuse you</text>
  <text start="317.14" dur="3.12">more than anything unless of course</text>
  <text start="318.64" dur="3.57">you&amp;#39;re on fire then it would be helpful</text>
  <text start="320.26" dur="3.87">but it says terrorists whose Mon Khan</text>
  <text start="322.21" dur="4.44">carries two knives and his tackled by</text>
  <text start="324.13" dur="6.09">men armed with a fire extinguisher and a</text>
  <text start="326.65" dur="6.389">narwhal tusks all right well okay so now</text>
  <text start="330.22" dur="4.98">we see the game hose him down hose him</text>
  <text start="333.039" dur="3.871">down he looks like he takes a swing at</text>
  <text start="335.2" dur="4.08">this man in front of them and then gets</text>
  <text start="336.91" dur="3.87">swung around I don&amp;#39;t know it looks a</text>
  <text start="339.28" dur="3.449">little bit suspect to me but they get</text>
  <text start="340.78" dur="4.5">him down with foam and a narwhal tusks</text>
  <text start="342.729" dur="4.591">and save the day now this is another</text>
  <text start="345.28" dur="4.11">video here the text says the attacker</text>
  <text start="347.32" dur="3.76">identified by authorities as monk on</text>
  <text start="349.39" dur="3.82">28th was shot dead by</text>
  <text start="351.08" dur="3.78">police and as you can see they&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="353.21" dur="3.06">most of the people off him he&amp;#39;s down on</text>
  <text start="354.86" dur="3.239">the ground right now and the police are</text>
  <text start="356.27" dur="3.389">holding them down but there&amp;#39;s still one</text>
  <text start="358.099" dur="3.81">guy in the background there he is now</text>
  <text start="359.659" dur="4.051">you can see him who was wrestling away</text>
  <text start="361.909" dur="3.54">the knife and I&amp;#39;m really really</text>
  <text start="363.71" dur="3.81">surprised that they didn&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="365.449" dur="3.571">straight-out bum-rush him I mean you can</text>
  <text start="367.52" dur="5.11">never judge these situations but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="369.02" dur="6.52">odd they&amp;#39;re kind of letting him go at it</text>
  <text start="372.63" dur="4.86">and then they go ahead and get it so</text>
  <text start="375.54" dur="3">maybe they were afraid that if they got</text>
  <text start="377.49" dur="3.12">involved somebody could have gotten</text>
  <text start="378.54" dur="3.3">stabbed I&amp;#39;ll allow for that but it seems</text>
  <text start="380.61" dur="3.57">a little bit strange that they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="381.84" dur="3.78">just completely bomb Raj&amp;#39;s eye I think</text>
  <text start="384.18" dur="3.12">there could have been a different way to</text>
  <text start="385.62" dur="3.48">do this but then again how many times do</text>
  <text start="387.3" dur="4.23">you prepare for a narwhal attack right</text>
  <text start="389.1" dur="5.49">anyway so guys then that looks like you</text>
  <text start="391.53" dur="5.22">got shot right there and in fade to</text>
  <text start="394.59" dur="4.89">black out now let&amp;#39;s look at some video</text>
  <text start="396.75" dur="5.39">from The Telegraph UK and they issued us</text>
  <text start="399.48" dur="5.13">a warning contains video some may find</text>
  <text start="402.14" dur="5.23">distressing and I would agree I find</text>
  <text start="404.61" dur="4.98">quite a bit of this distressing first</text>
  <text start="407.37" dur="4.32">thing that I find distressing is that</text>
  <text start="409.59" dur="3.93">over here do you see this black</text>
  <text start="411.69" dur="3.33">nothingness on the left side of your</text>
  <text start="413.52" dur="4.92">screen and then over here on the right</text>
  <text start="415.02" dur="5.97">this black nothingness over here both of</text>
  <text start="418.44" dur="4.44">these spaces which make up two-thirds of</text>
  <text start="420.99" dur="6.18">the screen could be filled with video</text>
  <text start="422.88" dur="5.49">but no anywhere so this is the video</text>
  <text start="427.17" dur="3.48">that we&amp;#39;re looking at where he gets</text>
  <text start="428.37" dur="3.78">pulled off and then it cuts right there</text>
  <text start="430.65" dur="4.17">so this seems to be the guy that&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="432.15" dur="4.86">most of the wrestling here but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="434.82" dur="4.17">assuming he already has the knife given</text>
  <text start="437.01" dur="3.81">away at this point because we cut to</text>
  <text start="438.99" dur="4.11">this shot right here which is also</text>
  <text start="440.82" dur="5.19">vertical video anyway so this guy is</text>
  <text start="443.1" dur="4.41">standing here ominously calm right here</text>
  <text start="446.01" dur="2.49">he&amp;#39;s kind of like that dude from</text>
  <text start="447.51" dur="6.66">children of the corn</text>
  <text start="448.5" dur="7.29">remember that anyway so the guy right</text>
  <text start="454.17" dur="3.24">here is the guy that has the knife where</text>
  <text start="455.79" dur="4.32">I&amp;#39;m circling my mouse here look at him</text>
  <text start="457.41" dur="5.07">again he seems to have gotten it in this</text>
  <text start="460.11" dur="5.1">process the video we&amp;#39;re looking at now</text>
  <text start="462.48" dur="4.8">occurs before the video I just showed</text>
  <text start="465.21" dur="3.99">you and you&amp;#39;ll see what I mean in a</text>
  <text start="467.28" dur="4.02">minute so he gets it looks like he&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="469.2" dur="3.84">a handkerchief and the knife looks like</text>
  <text start="471.3" dur="2.91">he was gonna do something at first and</text>
  <text start="473.04" dur="3.99">he&amp;#39;s still kind of surveying the scene</text>
  <text start="474.21" dur="3.99">and then he decides to get on out of</text>
  <text start="477.03" dur="3.84">there I think he&amp;#39;s trying to give some</text>
  <text start="478.2" dur="4.47">room here let me go back to mr. calm</text>
  <text start="480.87" dur="3.66">over here which I still think is very</text>
  <text start="482.67" dur="3.18">strange his body language is just so</text>
  <text start="484.53" dur="3.45">strange right there he doesn&amp;#39;t move his</text>
  <text start="485.85" dur="3.75">shoulders and watch the way he kind of</text>
  <text start="487.98" dur="3">turns around like right then and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="489.6" dur="4.95">gonna turn around one more time to look</text>
  <text start="490.98" dur="5.37">yeah okay we&amp;#39;re good and whatever so now</text>
  <text start="494.55" dur="3.54">this guy starts moving away with what</text>
  <text start="496.35" dur="3.27">seems to be the knife he had a</text>
  <text start="498.09" dur="3.54">handkerchief in his hand I think he puts</text>
  <text start="499.62" dur="3.51">it back in and then he&amp;#39;ll pull it out</text>
  <text start="501.63" dur="4.08">again but you see the wrestling</text>
  <text start="503.13" dur="3.36">continued and now this takes us up to</text>
  <text start="505.71" dur="2.43">the spa</text>
  <text start="506.49" dur="3.18">where the police pulled this other guy</text>
  <text start="508.14" dur="5.16">off you&amp;#39;ll see them right there in the</text>
  <text start="509.67" dur="7.62">jeans there he is okay so very very odd</text>
  <text start="513.3" dur="5.91">now we get another vertical video of</text>
  <text start="517.29" dur="5.55">this guy and I find it very odd that</text>
  <text start="519.21" dur="5.04">somebody filmed this man so well now of</text>
  <text start="522.84" dur="3.54">course there were bystanders on the</text>
  <text start="524.25" dur="4.59">street so it&amp;#39;s not completely shocking</text>
  <text start="526.38" dur="4.32">but it&amp;#39;s odd that we have so many great</text>
  <text start="528.84" dur="3.21">angles of this anyway this guy starts to</text>
  <text start="530.7" dur="3.21">run away it looks like he&amp;#39;s giving some</text>
  <text start="532.05" dur="4.2">space telling I made a backup fair</text>
  <text start="533.91" dur="3.84">enough and to be fair to this guy he</text>
  <text start="536.25" dur="3.99">looks like he&amp;#39;s holding that knife</text>
  <text start="537.75" dur="3.81">rather gingerly sorry about the little</text>
  <text start="540.24" dur="3.24">bar right there and the way I have to</text>
  <text start="541.56" dur="2.7">let it die down for a second there you</text>
  <text start="543.48" dur="2.91">go</text>
  <text start="544.26" dur="3.81">you can see he&amp;#39;s not really gripping it</text>
  <text start="546.39" dur="3.39">super hard there may be prints on that</text>
  <text start="548.07" dur="4.35">of course and all that so he&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="549.78" dur="4.56">people to kind of move away keeps</text>
  <text start="552.42" dur="4.5">checking back to see what&amp;#39;s up looks</text>
  <text start="554.34" dur="5.61">pretty tense and I just want to point</text>
  <text start="556.92" dur="5.31">out as he starts to move on this person</text>

  <text start="910.25" dur="2.88">I want to point out something really</text>
  <text start="911.45" dur="3.69">suspect to this - I just read you part</text>
