  <text start="1363.8" dur="5.1">okay so he goes on to buy all this stuff</text>

  <text start="1437.45" dur="4.26">remarkably Frick not only survived the</text>
  <text start="1439.76" dur="4.05">attack but was back at his desk within</text>
  <text start="1441.71" dur="3.66">the week but frisch&amp;#39;s reputation was</text>
  <text start="1443.81" dur="2.97">solid and it was the beginning of a</text>
  <text start="1445.37" dur="3.57">decade of strained relations between</text>
  <text start="1446.78" dur="4.86">Frick and Carnegie that would ultimately</text>
  <text start="1448.94" dur="4.77">send for it from Pittsburgh to New York</text>
  <text start="1451.64" dur="4.05">not however before Frick built his</text>
  <text start="1453.71" dur="4.02">companies Pittsburg headquarters right</text>
  <text start="1455.69" dur="3.72">next to Carnegie&amp;#39;s and taller so that</text>
  <text start="1457.73" dur="4.62">his building would overshadow his</text>
  <text start="1459.41" dur="6.05">rivalry ok so then it goes to talk about</text>
  <text start="1462.35" dur="5.55">how he rented the Vanderbilt mansion and</text>
  <text start="1465.46" dur="4.57">started collecting all sorts of</text>
  <text start="1467.9" dur="5.13">paintings and stuff like that before he</text>
  <text start="1470.03" dur="5.04">could finally build his own now there</text>
  <text start="1473.03" dur="4.44">was a problem when he wanted to actually</text>
  <text start="1475.07" dur="4.77">build this place and that was the fact</text>
  <text start="1477.47" dur="3.93">that there was a library there the Lenox</text>
  <text start="1479.84" dur="4.23">library and I wanted you to remember</text>
  <text start="1481.4" dur="4.38">that name a rare book and manuscript</text>
  <text start="1484.07" dur="3.9">collection founded by philanthropist</text>
  <text start="1485.78" dur="4.77">James Lennox and housed on the block of</text>
  <text start="1487.97" dur="4.38">Fifth Avenue between 70th and 71st</text>
  <text start="1490.55" dur="4.2">streets in a building designed by the</text>
  <text start="1492.35" dur="3.69">Dean of American architecture Richard</text>
  <text start="1494.75" dur="2.82">Morris</text>
  <text start="1496.04" dur="4.29">and I want to point out that that whole</text>
  <text start="1497.57" dur="5.4">area where Epstein lives there&amp;#39;s a still</text>
  <text start="1500.33" dur="5.79">an area called known as Lenox Hill so</text>
  <text start="1502.97" dur="4.62">they had to tear it down this library by</text>
  <text start="1506.12" dur="3.51">the time Frick set his sights on the</text>
  <text start="1507.59" dur="4.38">property the Lenox library was on the</text>
  <text start="1509.63" dur="4.41">verge of moving out in 1895 the</text>
  <text start="1511.97" dur="3.3">brand-new New York Public Library which</text>
  <text start="1514.04" dur="3.09">has been struggling to get off the</text>
  <text start="1515.27" dur="4.08">ground approached both the Lenox and</text>
  <text start="1517.13" dur="4.29">Astor libraries with the idea of a</text>
  <text start="1519.35" dur="4.74">merger when the Lenox trustees agreed</text>
  <text start="1521.42" dur="4.38">the NYPL considered moving into the</text>
  <text start="1524.09" dur="3.93">Lenox space perhaps building an</text>
  <text start="1525.8" dur="4.77">expansion onto what was then vacant land</text>
  <text start="1528.02" dur="3.87">stretching towards Madison Avenue okay</text>
  <text start="1530.57" dur="2.7">so I&amp;#39;m gonna leave the rest of the story</text>
  <text start="1531.89" dur="3.45">here but I want to pick apart a couple</text>
  <text start="1533.27" dur="5.19">things he actually offered to rebuild</text>
  <text start="1535.34" dur="5.43">this Lenox library in Central Park which</text>
  <text start="1538.46" dur="3.78">New Yorkers found kind of offensive they</text>
  <text start="1540.77" dur="3.42">kind of felt like he was passing it off</text>
  <text start="1542.24" dur="3.54">and then just dumping it in the library</text>
  <text start="1544.19" dur="3.54">even though he offered to do it stone by</text>
  <text start="1545.78" dur="4.38">stone but it was incredibly offensive</text>
  <text start="1547.73" dur="4.41">and nobody wanted any buildings inside</text>
  <text start="1550.16" dur="4.23">Central Park but he ended up getting</text>
  <text start="1552.14" dur="3.75">this building which became the Frick</text>
  <text start="1554.39" dur="3.99">Center and of course there it is right</text>
  <text start="1555.89" dur="4.44">there and it houses all kinds of crazy</text>
  <text start="1558.38" dur="5.16">paintings which you know guys like</text>
  <text start="1560.33" dur="4.68">Epstein are way way into okay so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1563.54" dur="3.24">a lot of connections here but just on a</text>
  <text start="1565.01" dur="5.31">surface level I find it very interesting</text>
  <text start="1566.78" dur="5.49">that Epstein has this 77 million dollar</text>
  <text start="1570.32" dur="4.17">mansion sitting right across from the</text>
  <text start="1572.27" dur="3.81">Frick Center both of them happen to be</text>
  <text start="1574.49" dur="3.6">interested in art and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1576.08" dur="5.07">in the right district lots of art there</text>
  <text start="1578.09" dur="6.06">but also lots of fashion there including</text>
  <text start="1581.15" dur="4.53">some really well-connected fashion</text>
  <text start="1584.15" dur="3.42">designers and of course I pointed out</text>
  <text start="1585.68" dur="4.62">Kate Spade and we all know how that</text>
  <text start="1587.57" dur="4.47">story ended very strange stuff in a</text>
  <text start="1590.3" dur="3.99">neighborhood that we know there&amp;#39;s lots</text>
  <text start="1592.04" dur="5.01">and lots of tunnels both the Frick</text>
  <text start="1594.29" dur="6.21">Center and this mansion owned by Epstein</text>
  <text start="1597.05" dur="6.27">had some kind of notorious construction</text>
  <text start="1600.5" dur="6.96">going on multiple times both of them are</text>
  <text start="1603.32" dur="6.96">connected to the Lenox family and of</text>
  <text start="1607.46" dur="4.8">course one actually housed a school for</text>
  <text start="1610.28" dur="4.14">them being a Epstein&amp;#39;s place one-time</text>
  <text start="1612.26" dur="5.16">housing the school for the Lenox Center</text>
  <text start="1614.42" dur="4.8">so really really interesting stuff and I</text>
  <text start="1617.42" dur="3.93">just pointed out to that before they</text>
  <text start="1619.22" dur="5.52">even built the Frick Center they were</text>
  <text start="1621.35" dur="5.07">renting the Vanderbilt place on 640</text>
  <text start="1624.74" dur="3.6">Fifth Avenue and of course we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
