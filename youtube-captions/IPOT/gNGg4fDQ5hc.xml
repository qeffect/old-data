  <text start="162.98" dur="4.83">36 23 24 minutes after the hour of 3:00</text>
  <text start="165.709" dur="5.221">we get a youtube link right yeah takes</text>
  <text start="167.81" dur="5.07">you to Fox News YouTube and Q is asking</text>
  <text start="170.93" dur="3.87">us to check out this from Fox and</text>
  <text start="172.88" dur="3.81">Friends at the 16 minute mark and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="174.8" dur="16.98">already got you dialed in so check it</text>
  <text start="176.69" dur="17.46">out so you have to look at that and I</text>
  <text start="191.78" dur="5.519">won&amp;#39;t tell you this about I never I</text>
  <text start="194.15" dur="7.85">never said it specifically on him but I</text>
  <text start="197.299" dur="35.341">watched Joe Biden with the prosecutor</text>
  <text start="202" dur="32.23">they took them off and he was the kid so</text>
  <text start="232.64" dur="3.54">there you have it although I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="234.23" dur="3.72">appreciate Fox cutting off the President</text>
  <text start="236.18" dur="5.13">of the United States while he&amp;#39;s giving</text>
  <text start="237.95" dur="6.24">an answer even if it is a long answer I</text>
  <text start="241.31" dur="4.649">do think POTUS is correct now we know</text>
  <text start="244.19" dur="3.24">that these EU countries are giving some</text>
  <text start="245.959" dur="3.271">aid too but many of these people are</text>
  <text start="247.43" dur="3.21">lining their own pockets and the point</text>
  <text start="249.23" dur="3.3">that Q is making here is that many</text>
  <text start="250.64" dur="3.81">people are lining their own personal</text>
  <text start="252.53" dur="3.39">bank accounts are we going to be sending</text>
  <text start="254.45" dur="2.94">massive amounts of money that&amp;#39;s simply</text>
  <text start="255.92" dur="4.14">go into other people&amp;#39;s bank accounts</text>
  <text start="257.39" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s theft that&amp;#39;s exactly what it is and</text>
  <text start="260.06" dur="3.9">they do that under the guise of foreign</text>
  <text start="262.28" dur="4.65">aid because they can kind of virtue</text>
  <text start="263.96" dur="5.13">signal and make you feel bad if you call</text>
  <text start="266.93" dur="4.59">bunk on all this who audits where</text>
  <text start="269.09" dur="3.18">foreign aid actually goes nobody Matt&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="271.52" dur="3.24">the point</text>
  <text start="272.27" dur="4.38">all these NGOs receive massive amounts</text>
  <text start="274.76" dur="3.62">of aid and this could be going into</text>
  <text start="276.65" dur="4.139">somebody&amp;#39;s Democratic fundraiser</text>
  <text start="278.38" dur="4.24">campaign it goes into stuff like Planned</text>
  <text start="280.789" dur="4.321">Parenthood this isn&amp;#39;t stuff that we</text>
  <text start="282.62" dur="4.32">voted on it is most certainly not</text>
  <text start="285.11" dur="4.11">taxation without representation right</text>
  <text start="286.94" dur="5.07">but this is going to line the coffers of</text>
  <text start="289.22" dur="4.68">a lot of people and that&amp;#39;s exactly why</text>
  <text start="292.01" dur="3.09">POTUS has ruffled so many feathers</text>
  <text start="293.9" dur="3.6">calling this out</text>
  <text start="295.1" dur="5.87">foreign aid goes to country acts</text>
  <text start="297.5" dur="5.49">personal bank accounts plus US persons</text>
  <text start="300.97" dur="4.21">involved and I think that we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="302.99" dur="5.01">this right we have seen this time and</text>
  <text start="305.18" dur="5.22">time again with numerous people who are</text>
  <text start="308" dur="4.02">also holding personal Bank bank accounts</text>
  <text start="310.4" dur="3.27">overseas and whatnot and when this</text>
  <text start="312.02" dur="3.51">foreign aid gets out it goes right back</text>
  <text start="313.67" dur="4.62">into their accounts and that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="315.53" dur="4.23">what Iran was Iran was a black was a</text>
  <text start="318.29" dur="3.63">black site there were all these green</text>
  <text start="319.76" dur="4.47">companies energy companies car companies</text>
  <text start="321.92" dur="4.02">going in there and operating freely and</text>
  <text start="324.23" dur="3.27">then of course there were all these that</text>
  <text start="325.94" dur="3.9">you remember of course the pallets of</text>
  <text start="327.5" dur="4.14">cash being flown out there too but there</text>
  <text start="329.84" dur="3.6">was a lot of cash being moved out there</text>
  <text start="331.64" dur="4.29">and nobody was really checking this and</text>
  <text start="333.44" dur="3.93">that&amp;#39;s because Iran didn&amp;#39;t care as long</text>
  <text start="335.93" dur="3.75">as they were getting a kickback think</text>
  <text start="337.37" dur="4.56">Paris Accord yeah they convert you</text>
  <text start="339.68" dur="3.84">signal you over climate change but the</text>
  <text start="341.93" dur="3.54">fact of the matter is that billions of</text>
  <text start="343.52" dur="3.54">dollars were just basically going into</text>
  <text start="345.47" dur="3.39">these companies whether they were fake</text>
  <text start="347.06" dur="4.23">green companies or energy companies like</text>
  <text start="348.86" dur="4.47">I said or just simply personal bank</text>
  <text start="351.29" dur="3.93">accounts it was easy to do because Iran</text>
  <text start="353.33" dur="4.7">was most certainly never going to check</text>
  <text start="355.22" dur="5.55">that but that was the attempt think all</text>
  <text start="358.03" dur="4.36">corrupt system do you think George Soros</text>
  <text start="360.77" dur="3.39">is spending his own money regarding push</text>
  <text start="362.39" dur="4.17">of radical viewpoint adoption now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="364.16" dur="4.53">spending yours and he&amp;#39;s just taking his</text>
  <text start="366.56" dur="4.08">own cut along the way and of course</text>
  <text start="368.69" dur="3.87">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people higher up path</text>
  <text start="370.64" dur="3.18">George Soros but George Soros is really</text>
  <text start="372.56" dur="3.75">the name that goes out there because his</text>
  <text start="373.82" dur="4.98">fingers aren&amp;#39;t in all the pies US</text>
  <text start="376.31" dur="4.77">taxpayer payment aid directly indirectly</text>
  <text start="378.8" dur="3.66">to George Soros organizations yeah how</text>
  <text start="381.08" dur="4.16">many times do we always trace this back</text>
  <text start="382.46" dur="5.01">to his open society or one of his other</text>
  <text start="385.24" dur="3.67">organizations right reread ROPS</text>
  <text start="387.47" dur="2.91">regarding foreign aid well we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="388.91" dur="3.81">doing that today but we get the idea</text>
  <text start="390.38" dur="5.13">right now this video takes you to a</text>
  <text start="392.72" dur="4.5">youtube link this video will get Donald</text>

  <text start="403.37" dur="4.11">it anymore probably on this channel for</text>
  <text start="404.96" dur="3.24">now listen carefully returning power to</text>
  <text start="407.48" dur="3.33">the people</text>
  <text start="408.2" dur="4.71">draining the swamp yeah when this money</text>
  <text start="410.81" dur="3.93">gets taken away from all these NGOs it</text>
  <text start="412.91" dur="4.32">goes right back into our pockets and</text>
  <text start="414.74" dur="4.139">that gives us purchasing power and the</text>
  <text start="417.23" dur="4.079">freedom to do what we</text>
  <text start="418.879" dur="4.02">with our money POTUS is fighting for you</text>
  <text start="421.309" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s been a long time since we&amp;#39;ve had a</text>
  <text start="422.899" dur="6.42">non corrupt POTUS who cares for the</text>
  <text start="425.059" dur="6.241">people and not himself q post 36 24 53</text>
  <text start="429.319" dur="4.261">minutes after the hour of 3:00 we get</text>
  <text start="431.3" dur="4.049">this Twitter status to Rudy Giuliani who</text>
  <text start="433.58" dur="3.269">says I discovered a pattern of</text>
  <text start="435.349" dur="3.72">corruption that the Washington press</text>
  <text start="436.849" dur="3.96">covered up for years I&amp;#39;m also going to</text>
  <text start="439.069" dur="3.93">bring out a massive pay-for-play scheme</text>
  <text start="440.809" dur="4.41">under the Obama administration that will</text>
  <text start="442.999" dur="4.801">devastate the Democrat Party do you</text>
  <text start="445.219" dur="4.68">honestly think I&amp;#39;m intimidated all right</text>
  <text start="447.8" dur="5.519">well q says it&amp;#39;s going to be biblical</text>
  <text start="449.899" dur="6">the Great Awakening q now please listen</text>
  <text start="453.319" dur="4.68">carefully I want to point out that</text>
  <text start="455.899" dur="3.72">although I&amp;#39;m very well aware the Q has</text>
  <text start="457.999" dur="4.741">referenced biblical quite a few times</text>
  <text start="459.619" dur="5.94">and has even referenced passages in the</text>
  <text start="462.74" dur="6.09">Holy Bible I want to offer up the idea</text>
  <text start="465.559" dur="4.86">that a Bible is a collection of books</text>
  <text start="468.83" dur="4.949">and I want you to really consider the</text>
  <text start="470.419" dur="5.49">context yes we are dealing with true</text>
  <text start="473.779" dur="4.62">true evil and we are talking about the</text>
  <text start="475.909" dur="4.74">Holy Bible and as far as that kind of</text>
  <text start="478.399" dur="4.47">thing goes but please consider that in</text>
  <text start="480.649" dur="3.901">this particular case I think we are</text>
  <text start="482.869" dur="5.27">talking about something different and</text>
  <text start="484.55" dur="6.119">I&amp;#39;m not grasping at straws on this now</text>
  <text start="488.139" dur="5.041">understand what Rudy Giuliani is saying</text>
  <text start="490.669" dur="6.24">here I&amp;#39;m going to bring out a massive</text>
  <text start="493.18" dur="5.649">pay-for-play scheme this means something</text>
  <text start="496.909" dur="3.69">very specific that Rudy is talking about</text>
  <text start="498.829" dur="3.45">and at the end says do you honestly</text>
  <text start="500.599" dur="3.87">think I&amp;#39;m intimidated</text>
  <text start="502.279" dur="4.53">now let me reference another tweet that</text>
  <text start="504.469" dur="4.771">he posted here from the 24th truth alert</text>
  <text start="506.809" dur="4.801">the statement I&amp;#39;ve made several times of</text>
  <text start="509.24" dur="5.01">having an insurance policy if thrown</text>
  <text start="511.61" dur="5.01">under the bus is sarcastic and relates</text>
  <text start="514.25" dur="4.529">to the files in my safe about the Biden</text>
  <text start="516.62" dur="2.729">families for decades monetizing of his</text>
  <text start="518.779" dur="3.66">office</text>
  <text start="519.349" dur="5.34">if I disappear it will appear</text>
  <text start="522.439" dur="5">immediately along with my Rico chart all</text>
  <text start="524.689" dur="4.71">right so we are talking about tangible</text>
  <text start="527.439" dur="5.38">information and I&amp;#39;ve thrown this out</text>
  <text start="529.399" dur="6.031">before a Bible is a collection of books</text>
  <text start="532.819" dur="5.07">now let&amp;#39;s remember this when it came</text>
  <text start="535.43" dur="5.55">down to these fights and warrants we had</text>
  <text start="537.889" dur="5.101">George papadopolis we had Carter Page we</text>
  <text start="540.98" dur="6.329">had general Flynn and we had Paul</text>
  <text start="542.99" dur="5.01">Manafort now Carter page was never</text>
  <text start="547.309" dur="3.741">charged</text>
  <text start="548" dur="5.12">Carter page never saw any jail time</text>
  <text start="551.05" dur="5.43">and now we&amp;#39;re starting to see thanks to</text>
  <text start="553.12" dur="5.7">these these altered emails from Kevin</text>
  <text start="556.48" dur="5.01">Kline Smith that the whole FISA</text>
  <text start="558.82" dur="5.4">application in regards to Carter page is</text>
  <text start="561.49" dur="5.219">falling apart too now in regards to</text>
  <text start="564.22" dur="3.9">George papadopolis we don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="566.709" dur="2.94">that&amp;#39;s gonna work out I have a feeling</text>
  <text start="568.12" dur="4.11">that that narrative is probably going to</text>
  <text start="569.649" dur="5.161">be next but he saw very little jail time</text>
  <text start="572.23" dur="5.34">he&amp;#39;s already out then we have general</text>
  <text start="574.81" dur="4.529">Flynn and that situation too is a little</text>
  <text start="577.57" dur="3.18">bit sketchy right those 302s were</text>
  <text start="579.339" dur="3.421">altered and we&amp;#39;re seeing that the</text>
  <text start="580.75" dur="4.079">origins of all that is a little bit</text>
  <text start="582.76" dur="3.24">faulty and of course it was Peter</text>
  <text start="584.829" dur="4.32">Struck&amp;#39;s buddy</text>
  <text start="586" dur="5.339">Rudy Contreras who took the plea deal</text>
  <text start="589.149" dur="4.021">that whole thing was messed up we know</text>
  <text start="591.339" dur="4.081">that that was altered and general Flynn</text>
  <text start="593.17" dur="4.32">has yet to be sentenced then we get to</text>
  <text start="595.42" dur="4.02">Paul Manafort and they locked him up</text>
  <text start="597.49" dur="4.38">threw away the key then I&amp;#39;ve been saying</text>
  <text start="599.44" dur="5.49">this over and over again and I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="601.87" dur="5.07">say it again keep your eye on Paul mana</text>
  <text start="604.93" dur="4.02">for now what brought manna fort down was</text>
  <text start="606.94" dur="3.48">this supposed ledger right all these</text>
  <text start="608.95" dur="3.48">misdeeds and I&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="610.42" dur="4.89">these Ledger&amp;#39;s what if there were</text>
  <text start="612.43" dur="6.06">numerous Ledger&amp;#39;s you know like a Bible</text>
  <text start="615.31" dur="6.029">a book here a book there a book there</text>
  <text start="618.49" dur="4.349">and that&amp;#39;s really the key and I have a</text>
  <text start="621.339" dur="4.231">feeling that it&amp;#39;s some of this</text>
  <text start="622.839" dur="4.531">information on these Ledger&amp;#39;s that not</text>
  <text start="625.57" dur="4.19">only brought down mana for but could</text>
  <text start="627.37" dur="6.39">bring down tons of different people</text>
  <text start="629.76" dur="5.199">remember this in context again suspend</text>
  <text start="633.76" dur="2.699">what you&amp;#39;re thinking about the Holy</text>
  <text start="634.959" dur="3.391">Bible for just a minute I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="636.459" dur="3.031">discounting that but what I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="638.35" dur="4.08">here is we&amp;#39;re talking about something</text>
  <text start="639.49" dur="5.49">very very specific Rudy Giuliani is</text>
  <text start="642.43" dur="6.2">talking about insurance policy files</text>
  <text start="644.98" dur="6.99">things kept in his safe pay-for-play</text>
  <text start="648.63" dur="5.829">he&amp;#39;s got something tangible there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="651.97" dur="5.22">reason why they put Paul Manafort away</text>
  <text start="654.459" dur="4.311">this guy hasn&amp;#39;t had any chance to talk</text>
  <text start="657.19" dur="4.29">they basically put him in solitary</text>
  <text start="658.77" dur="4.66">nobody can get to him now I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="661.48" dur="3.719">Paul mana for it&amp;#39;s a good guy he might</text>
  <text start="663.43" dur="3.54">have gone away for some things that were</text>
  <text start="665.199" dur="5.07">found on this ledger maybe this letter</text>
  <text start="666.97" dur="5.25">was indeed legit but my whole point is</text>
  <text start="670.269" dur="4.111">what if there were more Ledger&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="672.22" dur="4.29">what if the location of these Ledger&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="674.38" dur="4.019">are not completely known to everybody</text>
  <text start="676.51" dur="5.46">what if somebody&amp;#39;s holding that</text>
  <text start="678.399" dur="4.861">information notice that unlike Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="681.97" dur="2.06">Epstein Paul Manafort</text>
  <text start="683.26" dur="4.64">at least</text>
  <text start="684.03" dur="5.67">far as we know is still alive so why</text>
  <text start="687.9" dur="4.62">haven&amp;#39;t they gotten to him yet what is</text>
  <text start="689.7" dur="5.94">it that Paul Manafort knows it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="692.52" dur="5.07">to be biblical now I want to say thanks</text>
  <text start="695.64" dur="3.66">to Lisa Mae Crowley who I think is</text>
  <text start="697.59" dur="3.56">picking up what I&amp;#39;m putting down here</text>
  <text start="699.3" dur="5.22">she referenced this movie called</text>
  <text start="701.15" dur="6.7">law-abiding citizen and oddly enough the</text>
  <text start="704.52" dur="5.37">scene is called it&amp;#39;s gonna be biblical</text>
  <text start="707.85" dur="3.42">and I&amp;#39;m sorry I can&amp;#39;t play it for you</text>
  <text start="709.89" dur="3.21">but I want you to go ahead and see it</text>
  <text start="711.27" dur="4.02">you can type in the very keywords</text>
  <text start="713.1" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re a law-abiding citizen it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="715.29" dur="3.81">be biblical it&amp;#39;s a little bit vulgar so</text>
  <text start="717.84" dur="3.06">I&amp;#39;m not gonna play it but I&amp;#39;m definitely</text>
  <text start="719.1" dur="2.88">gonna get hit for copyright but you can</text>
  <text start="720.9" dur="4.88">hear he&amp;#39;s talking about bringing down</text>
  <text start="721.98" dur="6.51">all the people around him it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="725.78" dur="4.48">biblical so there you go and I think the</text>
  <text start="728.49" dur="3.42">reason Rudy Guiliani is talking about</text>
  <text start="730.26" dur="5.49">these threats is because there are</text>
  <text start="731.91" dur="5.4">indeed threats on Rudy Giuliani Giuliani</text>
  <text start="735.75" dur="4.83">has to get this information from</text>
  <text start="737.31" dur="4.59">somewhere where is he getting it from so</text>
  <text start="740.58" dur="2.55">if you want to bring all these people</text>
  <text start="741.9" dur="2.52">down and you&amp;#39;ve got all these files or</text>
  <text start="743.13" dur="3.78">whatever chances are there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="744.42" dur="4.8">actually tangible right there and it was</text>
  <text start="746.91" dur="5.61">that tangible information that put away</text>
  <text start="749.22" dur="7.26">Paul Manafort remember he was a big part</text>
  <text start="752.52" dur="5.73">of this entire story right now again I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="756.48" dur="4.05">not saying that we&amp;#39;re not talking about</text>
  <text start="758.25" dur="5.76">the Holy Bible because at some point</text>
  <text start="760.53" dur="5.49">this pay to play scheme it&amp;#39;s gonna open</text>
  <text start="764.01" dur="4.56">up to other things which will of course</text>
  <text start="766.02" dur="4.35">uncover the human trafficking aspect of</text>
  <text start="768.57" dur="5.04">all this and then of course we get into</text>
  <text start="770.37" dur="4.8">the Holy Bible aspect of that so please</text>
  <text start="773.61" dur="3.12">understand that there is kind of a</text>
  <text start="775.17" dur="3.93">separation there that I&amp;#39;m trying to make</text>
  <text start="776.73" dur="3.78">but it indeed looks like we are talking</text>
  <text start="779.1" dur="4.14">about some sort of tangible information</text>
  <text start="780.51" dur="4.29">that is getting exposed that is going to</text>
  <text start="783.24" dur="3.51">bring all these people down and of</text>
  <text start="784.8" dur="4.71">course that is part of the Great</text>
  <text start="786.75" dur="4.62">Awakening queue all right Patriots those</text>
