  <text start="331.28" dur="4.35">are not you two mutually exclusive okay</text>
  <text start="334.16" dur="3.09">so we all can actually had this guy</text>

  <text start="372.5" dur="4.11">for this week&amp;#39;s astonishing raids but</text>
  <text start="374.539" dur="4.951">also for the dismissal of the Vatican&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="404.57" dur="3.839">only after Malone and resigned okay so</text>
  <text start="406.669" dur="3.99">it looks like they put him his feet to</text>
  <text start="408.409" dur="4.921">the fire after he was investigating</text>
  <text start="410.659" dur="5.551">these regularities as irregular excuse</text>
  <text start="413.33" dur="6.3">me as was his job and of course instead</text>
  <text start="416.21" dur="4.62">of basically instead of getting indicted</text>
  <text start="419.63" dur="3.569">because he was going to basically turn</text>
  <text start="420.83" dur="4.2">around say you were spying on on us by</text>
  <text start="423.199" dur="4.71">looking into us even though that was his</text>
  <text start="425.03" dur="7.08">job the guy goes ahead and resigns and</text>
  <text start="427.909" dur="5.701">then bet you becomes now card those are</text>
  <text start="432.11" dur="3">established facts does this week&amp;#39;s raid</text>
  <text start="433.61" dur="4.47">tell us that Maloney had good reason to</text>
  <text start="435.11" dur="5.309">be suspicious probably if not of Betio</text>
  <text start="438.08" dur="4.92">at least of his guardian or his</text>
  <text start="440.419" dur="3.541">secretary the Vatican prosecutor seems</text>
  <text start="443" dur="3.479">to think so</text>
  <text start="443.96" dur="4.139">more facts will surely slowly emerge but</text>
  <text start="446.479" dur="3.81">even even after the few facts that have</text>
  <text start="448.099" dur="4.081">already come to light are sufficient to</text>
  <text start="450.289" dur="3.571">buttress one more argument that the</text>

  <text start="481.46" dur="3.66">just remember who was in Rome not</text>

  <text start="499.039" dur="4.801">his own devices might have uncovered</text>
  <text start="501.229" dur="4.651">more than two years ago it seems likely</text>

  <text start="522.32" dur="4.05">filling this post in February of this</text>
  <text start="523.909" dur="3.93">year the Vatican issued new statutes for</text>
  <text start="526.37" dur="3.839">the office of the Auditor General</text>
  <text start="527.839" dur="3.661">trimming his powers okay so it looks</text>
  <text start="530.209" dur="3.481">like they can&amp;#39;t want to keep this guy</text>
  <text start="531.5" dur="4.95">floating in this office while this whole</text>
  <text start="533.69" dur="4.79">thing goes down rather than appointing</text>
  <text start="536.45" dur="4.02">somebody like they had said as soon as</text>
  <text start="538.48" dur="3.94">possible all right so let&amp;#39;s talk a</text>
  <text start="540.47" dur="4.14">little bit about this Giovanni Angelo</text>
  <text start="542.42" dur="4.68">betchya seems like he&amp;#39;s a key figure in</text>
  <text start="544.61" dur="4.8">all this keep in mind this was the at</text>
  <text start="547.1" dur="4.65">the time archbishop who was keeping</text>
  <text start="549.41" dur="3.66">Maloney from doing this investigation as</text>
  <text start="551.75" dur="2.75">a matter of fact he was threatening him</text>

  <text start="554.5" dur="4.089">investigation into these financial</text>
  <text start="556.49" dur="3.57">irregularities we&amp;#39;re gonna indict you</text>
  <text start="558.589" dur="3.421">for spying and this guy ends up just</text>
  <text start="560.06" dur="2.79">going ahead and resigning so it sounds</text>
  <text start="562.01" dur="3.09">like there was something very very</text>
  <text start="562.85" dur="5.4">serious there now like I said that was</text>
  <text start="565.1" dur="6.27">2017 and he was an archbishop well in</text>
  <text start="568.25" dur="5.76">June of 2018 Pope Francis made him a</text>
  <text start="571.37" dur="4.08">cardinal and then again in August he</text>
  <text start="574.01" dur="3.87">became the head of the Congregation for</text>
  <text start="575.45" dur="5.699">the causes of saints so he stymies this</text>
  <text start="577.88" dur="6">investigation and months later he gets a</text>
  <text start="581.149" dur="6.071">heck of a promotion a heck of a 2018</text>
  <text start="583.88" dur="7.629">right you bet you it is</text>
  <text start="587.22" dur="6.239">because this anyway in 2009 Raul Castro</text>
  <text start="591.509" dur="4.62">was patting this guy on the back for his</text>
  <text start="593.459" dur="6">work on improving improving relations</text>
  <text start="596.129" dur="5.041">between Cuba and the Holy See and this</text>
  <text start="599.459" dur="3.63">guy is part of the Roman Curia</text>
  <text start="601.17" dur="3.33">and that is a big big deal it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="603.089" dur="3.12">basically it says here on we can</text>
  <text start="604.5" dur="3.42">Wikipedia then it&amp;#39;s like a chief of</text>
  <text start="606.209" dur="4.17">staff it is the administration</text>
  <text start="607.92" dur="4.8">administrative arm for the Holy See so</text>
  <text start="610.379" dur="4.89">this guy essentially could be in many</text>

  <text start="619.47" dur="3.659">of weight now if you&amp;#39;ll remember this</text>
  <text start="621.509" dur="5.01">story from back in the day of spinning</text>
  <text start="623.129" dur="5.611">around 2012 it was another leak story it</text>
  <text start="626.519" dur="4.92">was called the vatileaks and this</text>
  <text start="628.74" dur="5.88">involved at the time a pope benedict xvi</text>
  <text start="631.439" dur="5.491">his Butler his name was Palo Gabriela</text>
  <text start="634.62" dur="4.86">and he was caught with much document in</text>

  <text start="640.649" dur="4.74">but he was in his his place of residence</text>
  <text start="643.199" dur="4.2">and at the table Ezio came out strong</text>
  <text start="645.389" dur="4.44">against this guy this whistleblower here</text>
  <text start="647.399" dur="4.021">and this is a little bit from standard</text>
  <text start="649.829" dur="3.091">net on Tuesday the Vatican</text>
  <text start="651.42" dur="4.08">Undersecretary of State</text>
  <text start="652.92" dur="4.83">Archbishop Angelo Batio lashed out at</text>

  <text start="657.75" dur="3.809">attack on the Pope saying the stolen</text>
  <text start="659.519" dur="3.901">papers didn&amp;#39;t just concern matters of</text>
  <text start="661.559" dur="3.661">internal church governance but</text>
  <text start="663.42" dur="3.75">represented the thoughts of people who</text>
  <text start="665.22" dur="4.589">in writing to the Pope believed they</text>
  <text start="667.17" dur="4.349">were essentially speaking before God so</text>
  <text start="669.809" dur="4.83">he was definitely protecting whatever</text>
  <text start="671.519" dur="5.521">these secrets were but this happened in</text>
  <text start="674.639" dur="4.651">2012 and this came on the heels of a</text>
  <text start="677.04" dur="4.2">previous incident where a journalist</text>
  <text start="679.29" dur="3.96">named Gianluigi Nuzzi</text>
  <text start="681.24" dur="4.589">he had had some letters that were</text>
  <text start="683.25" dur="5.04">implying a whole bunch of misdeeds from</text>
  <text start="685.829" dur="4.711">the Holy See to now all oftentimes when</text>
  <text start="688.29" dur="3.539">we think about the top of the Catholic</text>
  <text start="690.54" dur="3">Church we think about obviously</text>
  <text start="691.829" dur="3.331">pedophilia and things like that of</text>
  <text start="693.54" dur="4.32">course although that a lot of that stuff</text>
  <text start="695.16" dur="4.83">ends up being true once again we were</text>
  <text start="697.86" dur="5.039">talking about money laundering this was</text>
  <text start="699.99" dur="5.73">as far back as 2012 money laundering and</text>
  <text start="702.899" dur="5.19">again remember much of these details</text>
  <text start="705.72" dur="3.15">were realizing has to do with real</text>
  <text start="708.089" dur="2.341">estate</text>
  <text start="708.87" dur="4.769">okay so it&amp;#39;s hard to know at this point</text>
  <text start="710.43" dur="4.829">if this was a legit raid or not seems</text>
  <text start="713.639" dur="4.26">like signs seem to point to a cover-up</text>
  <text start="715.259" dur="4.621">here but we&amp;#39;re not really sure but we do</text>
  <text start="717.899" dur="3.991">know that this bet geo guy</text>
  <text start="719.88" dur="3.66">a little bit suspect and it seems like</text>
  <text start="721.89" dur="3.36">he didn&amp;#39;t want anybody looking into</text>
  <text start="723.54" dur="4.14">these financial mis dealings and</text>
  <text start="725.25" dur="4.5">remember this all had to do with real</text>
  <text start="727.68" dur="4.59">estate now oddly enough just about a</text>
  <text start="729.75" dur="5.16">week ago we had this gentleman right</text>
  <text start="732.27" dur="6.09">here he may vaguely remember him Timothy</text>
  <text start="734.91" dur="4.92">cardinal Dolan and he came out on giving</text>
  <text start="738.36" dur="3.78">a little press conference just the other</text>

  <text start="781.32" dur="5.1">the challenge you might recall I</text>
  <text start="783.72" dur="6.06">observed back then was that people</text>
  <text start="786.42" dur="6.09">doubted the effectiveness and they</text>
  <text start="789.78" dur="4.74">doubted those very assurances okay so</text>
  <text start="792.51" dur="4.74">interestingly enough this cardinal Dolan</text>
  <text start="794.52" dur="4.86">was sort of brought in to clean up the</text>
  <text start="797.25" dur="4.41">image of the Catholic Church and of</text>

  <text start="820.65" dur="5.1">eventually promoted to Cardinal moved 57</text>
  <text start="823.71" dur="5.04">million dollars off the archdiocese and</text>
  <text start="825.75" dur="4.68">books into a cemetery trust fund six</text>
  <text start="828.75" dur="5.13">years ago in order to protect the money</text>
  <text start="830.43" dur="5.37">from damage suits by victims of abuse by</text>
  <text start="833.88" dur="2.31">priests okay that&amp;#39;s a lot to chew on</text>
  <text start="835.8" dur="4.44">there</text>
  <text start="836.19" dur="7.23">victims of abuse by priests all that</text>
  <text start="840.24" dur="5.52">money got moved into a trust fund not</text>
  <text start="843.42" dur="4.98">just a trust fund a cemetery trust fund</text>
  <text start="845.76" dur="4.5">what is a cemetery need fifty seven</text>
  <text start="848.4" dur="4.62">million dollars for and it</text>
  <text start="850.26" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;re talking about moving money now of</text>
  <text start="853.02" dur="3.75">course this was to protect these damage</text>
  <text start="855.3" dur="3.15">suits and it looks like they were</text>
  <text start="856.77" dur="3.39">holding it they&amp;#39;re probably using it for</text>
  <text start="858.45" dur="3.33">future you know they were obviously</text>
  <text start="860.16" dur="4.59">knowing they had a tongue to clean up</text>
  <text start="861.78" dur="4.89">there right so 57million moved into a</text>
  <text start="864.75" dur="3.06">cemetery trust fund this sounds like</text>
  <text start="866.67" dur="3.36">what we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="867.81" dur="3.96">cardinal Dolan now the Archbishop of New</text>
  <text start="870.03" dur="3.98">York has denied shielding the funds as</text>
  <text start="871.77" dur="4.44">an old and discredited allegation and</text>
  <text start="874.01" dur="4.54">malarkey but newly released court</text>
  <text start="876.21" dur="4.29">documents make it clear that he saw and</text>
  <text start="878.55" dur="4.05">received fast approval from the Vatican</text>
  <text start="880.5" dur="4.41">to transfer the money just as the</text>
  <text start="882.6" dur="4.35">Wisconsin Supreme Court was about to</text>
  <text start="884.91" dur="4.47">open the door to damage suits by victims</text>
  <text start="886.95" dur="4.29">raped and abused as children by Roman</text>
  <text start="889.38" dur="4.83">Catholic clergy okay so keep in mind</text>
  <text start="891.24" dur="5.07">this whistleblower Paulo back in 2012</text>
  <text start="894.21" dur="4.02">was releasing stuff that sounds like it</text>
  <text start="896.31" dur="3.81">would have suggested some crazy money</text>
  <text start="898.23" dur="3.96">being moved and here we are in 2013</text>
  <text start="900.12" dur="4.14">talking about these same things and it</text>
  <text start="902.19" dur="3.63">looks like cardinal Dolan was playing</text>
  <text start="904.26" dur="3.6">cleanup man and it looks like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="905.82" dur="4.14">playing cleanup man again now it says</text>
  <text start="907.86" dur="3.87">right here the release of about 6,000</text>
  <text start="909.96" dur="3.84">pages of documents providing a grim</text>
  <text start="911.73" dur="4.17">backstage look at the scandal</text>
  <text start="913.8" dur="4.26">graphically detailing the patterns of</text>
  <text start="915.9" dur="3.84">serial abuse by dozens of priests who</text>
  <text start="918.06" dur="3.87">were systematically rotated to new</text>

  <text start="921.93" dur="4.41">criminal behavior secret from civil</text>
  <text start="924.12" dur="3.78">authority okay and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="926.34" dur="3.45">been going on a lot of times these guys</text>
  <text start="927.9" dur="3.57">get reassigned as a matter of fact the</text>
  <text start="929.79" dur="4.23">other whistleblower that I mentioned</text>
  <text start="931.47" dur="4.62">John Gianluigi Nuzzi</text>
  <text start="934.02" dur="3.33">he was actually part of what got</text>
  <text start="936.09" dur="2.01">discovered is that he was being</text>
  <text start="937.35" dur="2.31">requested</text>
  <text start="938.1" dur="3.21">to be transferred to so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="939.66" dur="3.39">essentially what they were doing but it</text>
  <text start="941.31" dur="3.9">looks like this guy cardinal Dolan is</text>
  <text start="943.05" dur="4.32">the cleanup guy well like I said if you</text>
  <text start="945.21" dur="4.59">vaguely remember him I&amp;#39;m gonna go ahead</text>
  <text start="947.37" dur="6.51">and remember eyes-u with a new segment</text>
  <text start="949.8" dur="6.38">entitled vague memories and now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="953.88" dur="5.04">time for vague memories</text>
  <text start="956.18" dur="5.11">you know cardinal Dolan and I have some</text>
  <text start="958.92" dur="5.28">things in common for instance we both</text>
  <text start="961.29" dur="4.489">run impressive properties on Fifth</text>
  <text start="964.2" dur="4.77">Avenue</text>
  <text start="965.779" dur="4.421">of course his is much more impressive</text>
  <text start="968.97" dur="4.46">than mine</text>
  <text start="970.2" dur="10.71">that&amp;#39;s because I built mine with my own</text>
  <text start="973.43" dur="11.56">beautifully formed hands while his was</text>
  <text start="980.91" dur="7.2">built with the hands of God and nobody</text>
  <text start="984.99" dur="6.029">can compete with God is that correct</text>
  <text start="988.11" dur="5.82">nobody right that&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="991.019" dur="5.161">nope no contract okay so you probably</text>
  <text start="993.93" dur="5.01">remember our boy now and that was back</text>
  <text start="996.18" dur="4.68">in 2016 at the Al Smith charity dinner</text>
  <text start="998.94" dur="3.6">and of course both sides of the aisle</text>
  <text start="1000.86" dur="4.2">have always attended this dinner for a</text>
  <text start="1002.54" dur="4.41">very very long time and that is where</text>
  <text start="1005.06" dur="4.5">President Trump really got up and kind</text>
  <text start="1006.95" dur="3.84">of excoriated the deep state and it was</text>
  <text start="1009.56" dur="2.85">a really interesting time if you&amp;#39;ve not</text>
  <text start="1010.79" dur="3.03">seen that dinner I highly suggest you</text>
  <text start="1012.41" dur="3.35">check it out it was some of president</text>
  <text start="1013.82" dur="5.1">Trump&amp;#39;s now president Trump&amp;#39;s best work</text>
  <text start="1015.76" dur="4.84">but if you go back then you see Maria</text>
  <text start="1018.92" dur="3.81">Bartiromo was there Chuck Schumer&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1020.6" dur="3.75">there and you see him putting the heat</text>
  <text start="1022.73" dur="3.75">to a lot of people and of course</text>
  <text start="1024.35" dur="4.89">cardinal Dolan really got it kind of</text>
  <text start="1026.48" dur="5.459">like but there you have it now to be</text>
  <text start="1029.24" dur="4.77">fair cardinal Dolan has been notably</text>
  <text start="1031.939" dur="4.411">conservative obviously being a cardinal</text>
  <text start="1034.01" dur="4.079">and before that an archbishop they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1036.35" dur="4.17">want to come out as up and you know</text>
  <text start="1038.089" dur="4.711">publicly political at all but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1040.52" dur="3.659">pro-life guy he has slammed as a matter</text>
  <text start="1042.8" dur="3">of fact right before that dinner he and</text>
  <text start="1044.179" dur="4.231">slammed Hillary Clinton wanted her to</text>
  <text start="1045.8" dur="5.64">apologize to the Catholic Church on her</text>
  <text start="1048.41" dur="6.29">stance on abortion but that never ended</text>
  <text start="1051.44" dur="6.03">up happening and even before that in</text>
  <text start="1054.7" dur="4.84">2015 he&amp;#39;s been all over Trump</text>
  <text start="1057.47" dur="4.23">particularly on his immigration policies</text>
  <text start="1059.54" dur="4.98">even going as far as to compare him to</text>
  <text start="1061.7" dur="4.53">you know a KKK leader not seeing this</text>
  <text start="1064.52" dur="4.26">and that all the usual things that we</text>
  <text start="1066.23" dur="4.26">hear of course he&amp;#39;s slammed Trump on</text>
  <text start="1068.78" dur="4.41">immigration so we slammed both sides but</text>
  <text start="1070.49" dur="4.62">more notably Trump but I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="1073.19" dur="4.65">think it&amp;#39;s about his politics here this</text>
  <text start="1075.11" dur="3.96">guy looked to be moving some money and I</text>
  <text start="1077.84" dur="3.24">think that that&amp;#39;s probably what Trump</text>
  <text start="1079.07" dur="4.26">was getting that there when he was</text>
  <text start="1081.08" dur="4.8">referring to mr. Dolan okay so here we</text>
  <text start="1083.33" dur="4.8">got this cardinal Dolan who back in 2013</text>
  <text start="1085.88" dur="3.51">was being investigated or trying to be</text>
  <text start="1088.13" dur="3.99">investigated</text>
  <text start="1089.39" dur="4.86">this movement of funds 57 million</text>
  <text start="1092.12" dur="3.75">dollars into a cemetery trust fund and</text>
  <text start="1094.25" dur="3.36">just recently he&amp;#39;s come out talking</text>
  <text start="1095.87" dur="3.36">about abuse well all that money that was</text>
  <text start="1097.61" dur="4.38">being moved into that trust fund was to</text>
  <text start="1099.23" dur="4.47">shield themselves from abuse victims and</text>
  <text start="1101.99" dur="3.51">of course this was all coming right</text>
  <text start="1103.7" dur="4.56">around the same time we have this raid</text>
  <text start="1105.5" dur="5.49">on the offices of the secretary of state</text>

  <text start="1571.74" dur="4.5">and we know he&amp;#39;s connected at least</text>
  <text start="1574.289" dur="4.02">indirectly but he&amp;#39;s obviously supported</text>
  <text start="1576.24" dur="3.96">he must be aware of cardinal Dolan and</text>
  <text start="1578.309" dur="3.72">he seems to be connected to the Frick</text>
  <text start="1580.2" dur="3.839">Center we know the Frick Center is</text>
  <text start="1582.029" dur="3.961">connected to a lot of creepy stuff we</text>
  <text start="1584.039" dur="3.811">think that he&amp;#39;s probably it&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="1585.99" dur="3.51">connected to Epstein given the fact that</text>
  <text start="1587.85" dur="3.299">they&amp;#39;re right across the street and like</text>
  <text start="1589.5" dur="3.809">I said go watch that video to get some</text>
  <text start="1591.149" dur="3.931">of those connections but certainly this</text>
  <text start="1593.309" dur="4.59">Danielle boudin II wouldn&amp;#39;t be connected</text>
  <text start="1595.08" dur="7.01">to Epstein woody except for the fact</text>
  <text start="1597.899" dur="4.191">that he&amp;#39;s on the Epstein flight logs</text>
  <text start="1603.95" dur="5.47">and all right now I want to point out</text>
  <text start="1607.53" dur="3.69">that this guy at Giovanni celli who</text>
  <text start="1609.42" dur="4.8">married Bodie nee back in the day back</text>
  <text start="1611.22" dur="4.68">in 1979 at the time he was an archbishop</text>
  <text start="1614.22" dur="3.839">but of course he was an ambassador to</text>
  <text start="1615.9" dur="4.17">the United Nations and of course</text>
  <text start="1618.059" dur="4.621">buddhini was also connected to United</text>
  <text start="1620.07" dur="4.65">Nations but this guy was also part of</text>
  <text start="1622.68" dur="4.2">the Roman Curia which like I said was a</text>
  <text start="1624.72" dur="4.95">big big deal representative for the Holy</text>
  <text start="1626.88" dur="4.92">See and one of his big issues of course</text>
  <text start="1629.67" dur="5.009">was migration much like this cardinal</text>
  <text start="1631.8" dur="4.65">Dolan and much like our current Pope so</text>
  <text start="1634.679" dur="3.451">it all starts to come together a little</text>
  <text start="1636.45" dur="3.15">bit there&amp;#39;s a lot more research I&amp;#39;d like</text>
  <text start="1638.13" dur="3.78">to do on this particularly some of these</text>
  <text start="1639.6" dur="3.93">foundations and it&amp;#39;s really difficult</text>
  <text start="1641.91" dur="3.24">finding out what&amp;#39;s really going on with</text>
  <text start="1643.53" dur="4.05">this guy beau Dini but he was obviously</text>
  <text start="1645.15" dur="4.23">well-connected now he didn&amp;#39;t die in that</text>
  <text start="1647.58" dur="3.75">helicopter crash it was his helicopter</text>
  <text start="1649.38" dur="3.96">pilot we don&amp;#39;t know what really became</text>
  <text start="1651.33" dur="4.38">at this guy but we do know that he was</text>
  <text start="1653.34" dur="4.17">on the epstein flight logs and it looks</text>
  <text start="1655.71" dur="3.84">like I had obtained a more recent</text>
  <text start="1657.51" dur="4.89">version and they had taken that name off</text>
  <text start="1659.55" dur="4.17">so there you go now I&amp;#39;m over here on cue</text>
  <text start="1662.4" dur="2.76">map pub and I&amp;#39;m just kind of quickly</text>
  <text start="1663.72" dur="3.089">scrolling I&amp;#39;ve got highlighted in red</text>
  <text start="1665.16" dur="3.269">Godfather three there you can go check</text>
  <text start="1666.809" dur="3.721">it out for yourself I just want to point</text>

  <text start="1674.46" dur="3.599">Godfather three seems to be playing out</text>
  <text start="1676.53" dur="3.51">very much like this Catholic Church</text>

  <text start="1702.51" dur="4.83">to invest in the Catholic Church how</text>
  <text start="1705.33" dur="4.08">about that and in the beginning of the</text>

  <text start="1716.309" dur="3.841">gives six hundred million dollars to the</text>
  <text start="1718.679" dur="3.481">Catholic Church which just happened to</text>
  <text start="1720.15" dur="4.5">be in a deficit very much like the</text>
  <text start="1722.16" dur="4.59">Catholic Church was when cardinal Dolan</text>
  <text start="1724.65" dur="4.8">took over so poorly only gives six</text>

  <text start="1741.62" dur="2.76">you can go check it out for yourself</text>
  <text start="1743.06" dur="3.81">but it looks like this is playing out</text>
  <text start="1744.38" dur="4.38">and it looks like these Trust&amp;#39;s these</text>
  <text start="1746.87" dur="3.24">real estate firms are starting to be</text>
  <text start="1748.76" dur="3.03">connected maybe that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1750.11" dur="3.72">trying to cover up over there at the</text>
  <text start="1751.79" dur="3.93">Vatican but although we know they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1755.72" dur="4.11">money hiding well likely something much</text>
  <text start="1758.09" dur="5.37">much bigger which I think has to do with</text>
  <text start="1759.83" dur="5.31">human trafficking finally let me leave</text>
  <text start="1763.46" dur="4.65">you with one last thing this is an</text>
  <text start="1765.14" dur="5.19">article from France TV info from 2016</text>
  <text start="1768.11" dur="4.44">talking about this island called Ile</text>
  <text start="1770.33" dur="4.65">bear there and as you can see it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1772.55" dur="4.2">tiny little island with one old hotel</text>
  <text start="1774.98" dur="2.73">there now I don&amp;#39;t know a whole lot about</text>
  <text start="1776.75" dur="3.09">the hotel</text>
  <text start="1777.71" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s connected or almost connected to</text>
  <text start="1779.84" dur="3.57">the mainland there and it looks like a</text>
  <text start="1781.43" dur="5.22">ferry goes over from time to time and</text>
  <text start="1783.41" dur="4.35">when the tides rise and fall depends on</text>
  <text start="1786.65" dur="3.45">when you can go over there it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1787.76" dur="4.47">intermittent so there&amp;#39;s restricted</text>
  <text start="1790.1" dur="3.66">access to the island obviously as you</text>
  <text start="1792.23" dur="3.72">can see it&amp;#39;s small the only thing there</text>
  <text start="1793.76" dur="4.17">is pretty much that space right there</text>
  <text start="1795.95" dur="5.13">but what I found interesting about this</text>
  <text start="1797.93" dur="5.82">is that it is owned by animo beer called</text>
  <text start="1801.08" dur="4.08">Dubois now I don&amp;#39;t know much about them</text>
  <text start="1803.75" dur="3.06">I haven&amp;#39;t been able to figure out too</text>
  <text start="1805.16" dur="2.91">much about them because most of the</text>
  <text start="1806.81" dur="3.6">stuffs in French I haven&amp;#39;t been able to</text>
  <text start="1808.07" dur="3.96">figure out but what reminded me about</text>
  <text start="1810.41" dur="3.84">this and we talked about this probably</text>
  <text start="1812.03" dur="5.28">over a year ago this very same island is</text>
  <text start="1814.25" dur="5.1">that this eel burger is a hazard of</text>
  <text start="1817.31" dur="4.02">mobile right that just happens to own</text>
  <text start="1819.35" dur="4.02">this tiny little mysterious island that</text>
  <text start="1821.33" dur="3.99">has restricted access and knowing what</text>
  <text start="1823.37" dur="3.75">we know about things such as Epstein&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1825.32" dur="3.96">island these are the things that I tend</text>
  <text start="1827.12" dur="3.99">to look at but more even more odd was</text>
  <text start="1829.28" dur="5.07">this the bird there that President Trump</text>
  <text start="1831.11" dur="5.97">was referring to in his famous January</text>
  <text start="1834.35" dur="6.66">2019 tweet where he was talking about</text>
  <text start="1837.08" dur="4.77">hamburgers don&amp;#39;t really know but I</text>
  <text start="1841.01" dur="2.4">thought this was an interesting</text>
  <text start="1841.85" dur="3.24">connection and if any of you French</text>
  <text start="1843.41" dur="4.11">Patriots or french-speaking Patriots</text>
  <text start="1845.09" dur="4.59">could help out on this or maybe finding</text>
  <text start="1847.52" dur="4.11">some origins to this gia bois maybe that</text>
  <text start="1849.68" dur="3.45">would help us answer some questions</text>
