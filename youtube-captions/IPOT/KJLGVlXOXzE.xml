  <text start="439.14" dur="3.27">it&amp;#39;s hard to really know who to trust</text>
  <text start="440.94" dur="3.66">here especially when you see them</text>
  <text start="442.41" dur="4.23">policing themselves but I find this very</text>
  <text start="444.6" dur="3.69">interesting that we had these bunker</text>
  <text start="446.64" dur="4.11">raids and then of course bill Barr</text>
  <text start="448.29" dur="4.62">travels to Rome and along with John</text>
  <text start="450.75" dur="4.05">Durham and now Mike Pompeo everybody&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1062.72" dur="4.74">curious to me because most scary</text>
  <text start="1065.36" dur="5.43">Halloween movies or any kind of horror</text>

  <text start="1070.79" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s usually more action movie stuff</text>
  <text start="1072.62" dur="4.59">this usually involves machetes and bats</text>
  <text start="1074.84" dur="3.75">and slow chases and hockey masks and</text>
  <text start="1077.21" dur="2.76">people always slip into while they&amp;#39;re</text>
