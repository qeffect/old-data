  <text start="69.35" dur="4.71">got that in brackets how do you attempt</text>
  <text start="71.119" dur="5.101">to keep the narrative in play control</text>

  <text start="100.039" dur="3.36">hearing despite concerns from many on</text>
  <text start="102.2" dur="4.05">the left that his appearance was</text>
  <text start="103.399" dur="5.76">faltering and broke little new ground as</text>
  <text start="106.25" dur="4.83">a major next step Chairman Jerrold</text>
  <text start="109.159" dur="4.231">Nadler and the committee filed a</text>
  <text start="111.08" dur="5.28">petition in DC federal court on Friday</text>
  <text start="113.39" dur="5.219">to obtain grand jury materials from the</text>
  <text start="116.36" dur="4.74">former special counsels investigation</text>
  <text start="118.609" dur="4.381">the petition claims the panel needs the</text>
  <text start="121.1" dur="3.629">information in order to determine</text>
  <text start="122.99" dur="3.629">whether to recommend articles of</text>

  <text start="126.619" dur="5.101">requests more weight in the eyes of a</text>
  <text start="128.929" dur="4.471">court - meaning - meaningful - excuse me</text>
  <text start="131.72" dur="3.78">consider whether to exercise this</text>
  <text start="133.4" dur="3.929">Authority as well as to exercise its</text>
  <text start="135.5" dur="3.93">other pressing legislative and oversight</text>
  <text start="137.329" dur="4.231">responsibilities the committee must</text>
  <text start="139.43" dur="5.49">obtain evidence and testimony in a</text>
  <text start="141.56" dur="5.07">timely manner the filing reads now</text>
  <text start="144.92" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re called the grand jury materials</text>
  <text start="146.63" dur="4.139">critically important for their</text>
  <text start="148.1" dur="4.859">investigation in the petition Democrats</text>
  <text start="150.769" dur="4.141">on the committee noted that because just</text>
  <text start="152.959" dur="3.481">Justice Department policies do not allow</text>
  <text start="154.91" dur="3.9">the prosecution of a sitting president</text>
  <text start="156.44" dur="4.23">the House of Representatives is the only</text>
  <text start="158.81" dur="4.17">institution of the federal government</text>
  <text start="160.67" dur="4.17">that can hold Trump accountable okay so</text>
  <text start="162.98" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;ve got information sitting in a grand</text>
  <text start="164.84" dur="3.959">jury and of course grand jury</text>
  <text start="166.88" dur="3.389">information is classified because the</text>
  <text start="168.799" dur="4.171">grand jury needs to look at over the</text>
  <text start="170.269" dur="4.741">grand jury is responsible for deciding</text>
  <text start="172.97" dur="3.419">whether or not any kind of investigation</text>
  <text start="175.01" dur="2.879">and really not even investigation so</text>
  <text start="176.389" dur="3.6">much whether or not this goes to court</text>
  <text start="177.889" dur="3.901">or not so you never turn that kind of</text>
  <text start="179.989" dur="5.191">stuff over this kind of stuff should be</text>
  <text start="181.79" dur="4.4">taught in civics 101 right and of course</text>
  <text start="185.18" dur="3.32">Jerrold Nadler</text>
  <text start="186.19" dur="4.05">to get this and listen to this I mean</text>
  <text start="188.5" dur="3.33">this makes all the sense right here</text>
  <text start="190.24" dur="4.83">essentially they&amp;#39;re saying that they</text>
  <text start="191.83" dur="5.4">need the evidence in order to start an</text>
  <text start="195.07" dur="4.11">investigation and if you need evidence</text>
  <text start="197.23" dur="3.87">to start an investigation</text>
  <text start="199.18" dur="4.08">you had nothing in the first place all</text>
  <text start="201.1" dur="13.74">right so let me just sum up the Muller</text>
  <text start="203.26" dur="13.5">testimony right here could have gone</text>
  <text start="214.84" dur="3.54">better this is the key sentence here</text>
  <text start="216.76" dur="3.54">according to Q and had there called the</text>
  <text start="218.38" dur="4.4">grand jury materials critically</text>
  <text start="220.3" dur="5.52">important for their investigation yeah</text>
  <text start="222.78" dur="4.84">imagine that does neither understand</text>
  <text start="225.82" dur="4.44">that the critically important material</text>
  <text start="227.62" dur="5.91">requested would be illegal for a G bar</text>
  <text start="230.26" dur="5.19">to disclose you Betty does that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="233.53" dur="4.11">exactly why he wants it because he knows</text>
  <text start="235.45" dur="4.62">if he gets it it will cancel and negate</text>
  <text start="237.64" dur="4.35">everything all that information that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.07" dur="3.75">going on and you heard it from Muller</text>
  <text start="241.99" dur="4.76">himself during the testimony that there</text>
  <text start="243.82" dur="6">is still a lot of investigation going on</text>
  <text start="246.75" dur="4.81">straight-up it&amp;#39;s classified until it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="249.82" dur="3.57">not and it sucks for us too because we</text>
  <text start="251.56" dur="3.81">want to know but at the end of the day</text>
  <text start="253.39" dur="4.08">if we want to get any kind of arrests</text>
  <text start="255.37" dur="4.47">that are gonna stick this is how it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="257.47" dur="4.44">got to get done now we get this link to</text>
  <text start="259.84" dur="4.35">the National Review and it says Court</text>
  <text start="261.91" dur="6.68">ruling implies that bar must redact</text>
  <text start="264.19" dur="4.4">grand jury info from Muller report</text>
  <text start="268.83" dur="4.99">Democrats will complain and they will</text>
  <text start="271.78" dur="3.54">but the Attorney General can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="273.82" dur="3.36">faulted for following the law in</text>
  <text start="275.32" dur="3.75">disclosing the Muller report Attorney</text>
  <text start="277.18" dur="3.84">General William bar will have to redact</text>
  <text start="279.07" dur="4.14">grand jury information this is the</text>
  <text start="281.02" dur="4.44">upshot of the ruling today by a divided</text>
  <text start="283.21" dur="5.28">panel of the US Court of Appeals for the</text>
  <text start="285.46" dur="4.709">DC Circuit and let me just bring you to</text>
  <text start="288.49" dur="5.04">the crooks of the matter here at issue</text>
  <text start="290.169" dur="5.581">was this question does a federal court</text>
  <text start="293.53" dur="4.44">have the authority to order disclosure</text>
  <text start="295.75" dur="4.29">of grand jury materials if the judge</text>
  <text start="297.97" dur="5.52">decides that the interests of justice</text>
  <text start="300.04" dur="5.49">warrant doing so or is the judge limited</text>
  <text start="303.49" dur="5.04">to the exceptions to grand jury secrecy</text>
  <text start="305.53" dur="5.31">that are spelled out in rule 6 e of the</text>
  <text start="308.53" dur="4.95">federal rules of Criminal Procedure the</text>
  <text start="310.84" dur="5.37">DC Circuit&amp;#39;s Makeba ruling holds that</text>
  <text start="313.48" dur="3.09">the text of rule 6 e controls well there</text>
  <text start="316.21" dur="2.7">you go</text>
  <text start="316.57" dur="5.37">consequently judges have no at the</text>
  <text start="318.91" dur="4.8">to authorize disclosure outside the rule</text>
  <text start="321.94" dur="3.96">and here&amp;#39;s what he wants us to see here</text>
  <text start="323.71" dur="4.65">this means Attorney General bar must</text>
  <text start="325.9" dur="4.62">redact grand jury material from the</text>
  <text start="328.36" dur="4.26">Moller report before disclosing it to</text>
  <text start="330.52" dur="3.75">Congress Democrats will complain long</text>
  <text start="332.62" dur="3.57">and loud about this but I don&amp;#39;t see how</text>
  <text start="334.27" dur="4.35">bar can be reasonably faulted for</text>
  <text start="336.19" dur="4.17">following the law Congress after all has</text>
  <text start="338.62" dur="4.17">the power to legislate an amendment to</text>
  <text start="340.36" dur="4.38">rule 6 e that would permit a disclosure</text>
  <text start="342.79" dur="4.2">of grand jury materials from a Special</text>
  <text start="344.74" dur="4.47">Counsel investigation to appropriate</text>
  <text start="346.99" dur="3.93">congressional committees ok well if they</text>
  <text start="349.21" dur="3.51">have that power to legislate the</text>
  <text start="350.92" dur="3.69">amendment how come they haven&amp;#39;t done</text>
  <text start="352.72" dur="4.05">that right we&amp;#39;re members of the Democrat</text>
  <text start="354.61" dur="4.71">Party Congress attempt to amend rule 60</text>
  <text start="356.77" dur="6.66">in order to obtain grand jury material</text>
  <text start="359.32" dur="6.21">deemed critically important I doubt it</text>
  <text start="363.43" dur="4.74">no logical thinking why because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="365.53" dur="5.13">still going to expose really what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="368.17" dur="4.62">going on look even if you get the</text>
  <text start="370.66" dur="3.54">information the wrong way the</text>
  <text start="372.79" dur="3.6">information is still going to come out</text>
  <text start="374.2" dur="4.23">they don&amp;#39;t want it to come out all they</text>
  <text start="376.39" dur="4.32">really want to do is tie the courts up</text>
  <text start="378.43" dur="4.53">in minutia long enough to try and think</text>
  <text start="380.71" dur="4.14">of something else we know this already</text>
  <text start="382.96" dur="4.98">they don&amp;#39;t really want to accomplish</text>
  <text start="384.85" dur="5.1">anything other than just tying us up in</text>
  <text start="387.94" dur="4.38">the courts why paint a narrative that</text>
  <text start="389.95" dur="4.74">the one item you cannot possess is the</text>
  <text start="392.32" dur="4.71">one item you need in order to justify</text>
  <text start="394.69" dur="5.19">your argument for the same reason that</text>
  <text start="397.03" dur="4.5">people will like if you ever see two men</text>
  <text start="399.88" dur="3.57">that don&amp;#39;t want to fight and they kind</text>
  <text start="401.53" dur="3.389">of get in this little shoving match and</text>
  <text start="403.45" dur="3.03">you know that neither one of them wants</text>
  <text start="404.919" dur="2.971">to swing because neither one of them</text>
  <text start="406.48" dur="4.08">wants to get into a fight can&amp;#39;t blame</text>
  <text start="407.89" dur="4.83">them but they just don&amp;#39;t want to back</text>
  <text start="410.56" dur="4.77">down hold me back bro that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="412.72" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re doing hold me back bro people</text>
  <text start="415.33" dur="4.98">elected knowingly spread spreading false</text>
  <text start="417.94" dur="4.02">information disinformation yeah of</text>
  <text start="420.31" dur="3.03">course they are of course they are and</text>
  <text start="421.96" dur="2.97">they&amp;#39;re all getting the same talking</text>
  <text start="423.34" dur="3.72">points from the same people until they</text>
  <text start="424.93" dur="3.51">get orders to do something next they</text>
  <text start="427.06" dur="3.15">don&amp;#39;t really know what they&amp;#39;re gonna do</text>
  <text start="428.44" dur="3.84">they were hoping the Moller thing was</text>
  <text start="430.21" dur="4.11">gonna turn out great didn&amp;#39;t turn out so</text>
  <text start="432.28" dur="3.96">well for them so now they got a move</text>
  <text start="434.32" dur="4.05">towards impeachment and impeachment is</text>
  <text start="436.24" dur="3.84">really the only thing that they want and</text>
  <text start="438.37" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re using this premise in order to</text>
  <text start="440.08" dur="3.18">support that well the fact of the matter</text>
  <text start="441.79" dur="3.54">is that even if they get that</text>
  <text start="443.26" dur="3.63">information it&amp;#39;s going to be damning on</text>
  <text start="445.33" dur="3.12">them they don&amp;#39;t really want it because</text>
  <text start="446.89" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re holding me back bro</text>

  <text start="471.78" dur="4.289">Twitter for quite some time I imagine a</text>
  <text start="473.55" dur="3.78">lot of you have already read it but</text>
  <text start="476.069" dur="2.371">basically it just talks about a little</text>
  <text start="477.33" dur="4.019">bit about our background and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="478.44" dur="4.89">talked quite a bit about it as well she</text>
  <text start="481.349" dur="4.831">comes from a very wealthy father British</text>
  <text start="483.33" dur="5.94">media mogul and he was part of the Daily</text>
  <text start="486.18" dur="5.31">Mirror which was a real big deal and of</text>
  <text start="489.27" dur="5.07">course he had a lot of ties to different</text>
  <text start="491.49" dur="4.89">things like Mossad mi6 he was long</text>
  <text start="494.34" dur="4.35">suspected that was really no big secret</text>
  <text start="496.38" dur="5.31">that was kind of public knowledge also</text>
  <text start="498.69" dur="4.65">mentions here that she was educated at</text>
  <text start="501.69" dur="3.479">the prestigious Marlborough boarding</text>
  <text start="503.34" dur="4.199">school in the UK they always seemed to</text>
  <text start="505.169" dur="5.25">be going to these crazy schools now</text>
  <text start="507.539" dur="5.971">oddly enough her pop he died</text>
  <text start="510.419" dur="4.201">mysteriously on his yacht 1991 that was</text>
  <text start="513.51" dur="3.569">named Lady</text>
  <text start="514.62" dur="4.229">Ghislaine and then it goes to talk about</text>
  <text start="517.079" dur="3.931">this social club that she founded the</text>
  <text start="518.849" dur="4.23">Kit Kat club a social organization for</text>

  <text start="546.27" dur="4.77">up chick right very much like Rachel</text>
  <text start="548.61" dur="4.59">Chandler is nowadays it&amp;#39;s just a younger</text>
  <text start="551.04" dur="3.81">version of the same thing it goes on to</text>
  <text start="553.2" dur="4.949">say hear how she&amp;#39;s talking about how she</text>
  <text start="554.85" dur="5.85">met Jeffrey Epstein as a strategic</text>
  <text start="558.149" dur="4.801">launchpad for her career as a New York</text>
  <text start="560.7" dur="4.11">City philanthropist and socialite</text>
  <text start="562.95" dur="3.509">okay well neither of those things are</text>
  <text start="564.81" dur="4.529">careers that just happens when you</text>
  <text start="566.459" dur="4.711">already have money and of course we know</text>
  <text start="569.339" dur="3.421">about all these philanthropists these</text>
  <text start="571.17" dur="2.97">days we know what they&amp;#39;re doing we know</text>
  <text start="572.76" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re really doing it for all the</text>
  <text start="574.14" dur="4.17">children they&amp;#39;re always seem to be so</text>
  <text start="575.82" dur="4.17">darn concerned with the children right</text>
  <text start="578.31" dur="3.69">then it goes on to talk about some of</text>
  <text start="579.99" dur="4.14">these various lawsuits against Epstein</text>
  <text start="582" dur="3.88">and some of the common themes here is</text>
  <text start="584.13" dur="3.58">that she&amp;#39;s constantly</text>
  <text start="585.88" dur="4.35">mentioned in all of them so she&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="587.71" dur="4.89">very highly implicated and just like</text>
  <text start="590.23" dur="4.02">Epstein right now is probably a high</text>
  <text start="592.6" dur="4.53">target for the deep state they would</text>
  <text start="594.25" dur="5.19">love to see him removed at this point we</text>
