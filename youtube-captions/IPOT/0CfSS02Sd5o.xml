  <text start="194.06" dur="3.6">persecuted with even the ultimate</text>
  <text start="195.89" dur="3.93">penalty in other countries I am aware</text>
  <text start="197.66" dur="4.8">that my invitation here was because of</text>
  <text start="199.82" dur="4.92">some recent mass shootings I assure you</text>
  <text start="202.46" dur="3.75">that neither myself nor any of my staff</text>
  <text start="204.74" dur="3.81">have participated in any of these</text>
  <text start="206.21" dur="4.65">atrocities the recent letter and serious</text>
  <text start="208.55" dur="4.11">nature of it resonate in my soul and I</text>
  <text start="210.86" dur="3">feel deep despair and heartache for the</text>
  <text start="212.66" dur="3.39">families of the victims of these</text>
  <text start="213.86" dur="4.5">shootings most recently in Alabama in</text>
  <text start="216.05" dur="3.99">Texas and other victims worldwide now</text>
  <text start="218.36" dur="3.51">down here in part three it talks a</text>
  <text start="220.04" dur="4.11">little bit about what HN essentially is</text>
  <text start="221.87" dur="4.5">a chant is an image board where users</text>
  <text start="224.15" dur="4.56">can post anonymously on existing boards</text>
  <text start="226.37" dur="3.78">or on boards they create themselves an</text>
  <text start="228.71" dur="3.42">image board is comprised of multiple</text>
  <text start="230.15" dur="4.17">boards a board is a collection of</text>
  <text start="232.13" dur="5.88">threads which are displayed as a catalog</text>
  <text start="234.32" dur="6">or an index page threads contain replies</text>
  <text start="238.01" dur="5.13">users can either create new threads as</text>
  <text start="240.32" dur="5.37">original posters or opiez and if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="243.14" dur="3.62">heard Q talk about think Opie sometimes</text>
  <text start="245.69" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re referring to</text>
  <text start="246.76" dur="6.1">sometimes or reply to existing threads</text>
  <text start="249.68" dur="5.1">on their boards of choice on HN anyone</text>
  <text start="252.86" dur="4.2">can create a board using the create</text>
  <text start="254.78" dur="4.8">feature when a user creates a board he</text>
  <text start="257.06" dur="4.92">or she becomes a board owner in a chain</text>
  <text start="259.58" dur="4.44">parlance a board owner can add board</text>
  <text start="261.98" dur="4.38">volunteers to help moderate the board</text>
  <text start="264.02" dur="4.83">using it and now as she HN works like a</text>
  <text start="266.36" dur="4.44">federation with the HN Administration as</text>
  <text start="268.85" dur="4.47">the federal government each board as a</text>
  <text start="270.8" dur="4.62">state and each board owner as a governor</text>
  <text start="273.32" dur="4.56">each board has its own rules but the</text>
  <text start="275.42" dur="5.34">only rule every board has to abide by is</text>
  <text start="277.88" dur="6.21">the 8chan global rule which states do</text>
  <text start="280.76" dur="5.58">not post requests or leg to any Content</text>
  <text start="284.09" dur="4.44">that is illegal in the United States of</text>
  <text start="286.34" dur="4.23">America and do not create boards with</text>
  <text start="288.53" dur="4.95">the purpose of posting or spreading such</text>
  <text start="290.57" dur="4.35">content so this is a six page document</text>
  <text start="293.48" dur="2.76">let me take you down to part seven just</text>
  <text start="294.92" dur="3.9">basically letting you know what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="296.24" dur="4.71">doing now at this time 8chan is offline</text>
  <text start="298.82" dur="4.469">voluntarily the site may come back</text>
  <text start="300.95" dur="4.29">online but only when HN is able to</text>
  <text start="303.289" dur="3.99">develop additional tools to counter</text>
  <text start="305.24" dur="4.169">illegal content under United States law</text>
  <text start="307.279" dur="4.681">so if we are going to hear from Q it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="309.409" dur="4.71">going to be whenever that time is a Chan</text>
  <text start="311.96" dur="4.379">has had limited contact with Silicon</text>
  <text start="314.119" dur="4.26">Valley technology companies or their</text>
  <text start="316.339" dur="4.23">staff and t technology has contracts</text>
  <text start="318.379" dur="4.201">with Aaron to coast I&amp;#39;m think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="320.569" dur="3.9">right to coast and epic there have been</text>
  <text start="322.58" dur="3.78">no sharing of information or networking</text>
  <text start="324.469" dur="3.78">or any joint effort with any other</text>
  <text start="326.36" dur="4.259">Silicon Valley technology companies</text>
  <text start="328.249" dur="4.26">furthermore hñ has had no contact with</text>
  <text start="330.619" dur="4.02">any companies or staff in charge of</text>
  <text start="332.509" dur="4.86">alternative social media website if</text>
  <text start="334.639" dur="4.92">8chan comes back online it will be done</text>
  <text start="337.369" dur="4.23">when 8chan develops additional tools to</text>
  <text start="339.559" dur="4.92">counter illegal content under United</text>
  <text start="341.599" dur="4.47">States law if a chan returns staff would</text>
  <text start="344.479" dur="3.541">implement a way to restrict certain</text>
  <text start="346.069" dur="4.261">parts of the website during a state of</text>
  <text start="348.02" dur="4.109">emergency in which case any board in</text>
  <text start="350.33" dur="4.079">question would be put into a read-only</text>
  <text start="352.129" dur="4.62">mode until it would be deemed safe</text>
  <text start="354.409" dur="3.451">enough to enable posting again now I</text>
  <text start="356.749" dur="3.331">want you to really really pay attention</text>
  <text start="357.86" dur="3.419">to that because a read-only mode is kind</text>
  <text start="360.08" dur="2.819">of what we&amp;#39;ve been introduced to you</text>
  <text start="361.279" dur="4.771">with the Patriots fight board that was a</text>
  <text start="362.899" dur="4.591">read-only board right so I have a</text>
  <text start="366.05" dur="4.049">feeling that this could get a little bit</text>
  <text start="367.49" dur="5.819">ugly here but it might be a way to</text>
  <text start="370.099" dur="5.91">introduce the content of Q into the</text>
  <text start="373.309" dur="4.11">public eye under you know a lawsuit I</text>
  <text start="376.009" dur="3.45">don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s exactly going to</text>
  <text start="377.419" dur="3.96">happen but it looks like that could be</text>
  <text start="379.459" dur="3.21">possible it also looks forward to</text>
  <text start="381.379" dur="3.301">working with the federal government to</text>
  <text start="382.669" dur="3.9">improve the law making reporting and</text>
  <text start="384.68" dur="3.9">engaging engagements Cuse me with law</text>
  <text start="386.569" dur="4.14">enforcement agents agencies easier</text>
  <text start="388.58" dur="4.319">towards this end a chant includes its</text>
  <text start="390.709" dur="4.651">list of suggested legislative reforms as</text>
  <text start="392.899" dur="4.29">Exhibit B so it remains to be seeing</text>
  <text start="395.36" dur="3.299">what&amp;#39;s going to happen here like I said</text>
  <text start="397.189" dur="2.94">by the time you&amp;#39;re watching this video</text>
  <text start="398.659" dur="4.021">we might even get some more updates</text>
  <text start="400.129" dur="3.96">happening but this should be a big deal</text>
  <text start="402.68" dur="3.239">and the reason I think it&amp;#39;s a big deal</text>
  <text start="404.089" dur="3.33">is because a the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="405.919" dur="3.9">nowhere to be found on it so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="407.419" dur="4.5">probably important but this really has a</text>
  <text start="409.819" dur="5.52">lot to do with free speech and of course</text>
  <text start="411.919" dur="5.61">hñ is a really really crazy place it has</text>
  <text start="415.339" dur="4.38">been for a while so is 4G and so is</text>
  <text start="417.529" dur="4.47">Twitter so is Facebook all these social</text>
  <text start="419.719" dur="3.9">media companies really really have a</text>
  <text start="421.999" dur="3.72">little bit of a responsibility to bear</text>
  <text start="423.619" dur="3.811">and some of this but it should be</text>
  <text start="425.719" dur="4.56">interesting now for those of you who</text>
  <text start="427.43" dur="6.24">don&amp;#39;t know a Chan was sold to James</text>
  <text start="430.279" dur="7.171">Watkins in 2014 by Fredrik Brendan</text>
  <text start="433.67" dur="6.63">young man and this guy was also getting</text>
  <text start="437.45" dur="4.68">a lot of flack you know for a long time</text>
  <text start="440.3" dur="4.02">about child abuse and rape and the</text>
  <text start="442.13" dur="4.11">content and things like this and very</text>
  <text start="444.32" dur="4.65">much like Watkins defended to free</text>
  <text start="446.24" dur="4.98">speech although he ended up kind of</text>
  <text start="448.97" dur="4.65">saying that this place became a sort of</text>
  <text start="451.22" dur="4.11">a haven for white nationalism and now</text>
  <text start="453.62" dur="3.96">that it&amp;#39;s been knocked off by a cloud</text>
  <text start="455.33" dur="4.44">fare who was hosting it has really</text>
  <text start="457.58" dur="4.59">supported it so it&amp;#39;s very very strange</text>
  <text start="459.77" dur="4.95">and that this guy lives out in the</text>
  <text start="462.17" dur="4.02">Philippines has since 2014 but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="464.72" dur="3.3">Frederic Brennan if you want to know</text>
  <text start="466.19" dur="3.63">more about this story this is a really</text>

  <text start="872.42" dur="5.19">from the stem express you get more money</text>
  <text start="874.85" dur="5.31">for tissues like if you got a brain</text>
  <text start="877.61" dur="5.13">versus or liver versus like blood sample</text>
  <text start="880.16" dur="7.38">there&amp;#39;s different tissue categories okay</text>
  <text start="882.74" dur="7.41">there&amp;#39;s category a B and C so a is like</text>

  <text start="895.37" dur="3.64">lot easier</text>
  <text start="896.44" dur="5.73">get these and we could take more from it</text>
  <text start="899.01" dur="6.46">1120 specimens you know you&amp;#39;re getting</text>

  <text start="912.43" dur="3.71">technicians from stem Express sounds to</text>
  <text start="914.56" dur="5.52">me like it was getting increasingly</text>
  <text start="916.14" dur="4.93">built around how valuable of body parts</text>
  <text start="920.08" dur="3.93">can they harvest at Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="921.07" dur="5.22">for stem Express corporate exactly the</text>
  <text start="924.01" dur="4.41">law is that you&amp;#39;re allowed to donate</text>
  <text start="926.29" dur="4.32">human body parts but nobody is supposed</text>
  <text start="928.42" dur="5.1">to be selling and making money off of</text>

  <text start="933.52" dur="5.28">whether it&amp;#39;s adult fetal aborted car</text>
  <text start="935.59" dur="4.8">accident or whatever but you look at the</text>
  <text start="938.8" dur="4.53">business model of stem express where</text>
  <text start="940.39" dur="6.48">everything is based around the you know</text>

  <text start="946.87" dur="3.54">transfer of aborted human fetal body</text>
  <text start="949.9" dur="2.49">parts</text>
  <text start="950.41" dur="3.89">it looks clearly like it&amp;#39;s a you know it</text>
  <text start="952.39" dur="5.16">looks like it&amp;#39;s about maximizing volume</text>
  <text start="954.3" dur="5.02">maximizing revenue maximizing profit off</text>
  <text start="957.55" dur="3.87">of aborted fetal tissue</text>

  <text start="1186.51" dur="3.84">clear distinction meaning that they</text>
  <text start="1188.37" dur="3.179">don&amp;#39;t actually have the you know they</text>
  <text start="1190.35" dur="2.25">don&amp;#39;t have a parking lot with all their</text>
  <text start="1191.549" dur="2.49">different trucks and everything like</text>
  <text start="1192.6" dur="3.15">that it&amp;#39;s not one of those centers it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1194.039" dur="3.451">just an on-site receiving and shipping</text>
  <text start="1195.75" dur="4.139">center so if something would have to</text>
  <text start="1197.49" dur="4.62">come and get whatever was arriving there</text>
  <text start="1199.889" dur="4.051">but these are very well could have been</text>
  <text start="1202.11" dur="4.47">the sites that that person was talking</text>
  <text start="1203.94" dur="5.729">about now keep in mind we know that</text>
  <text start="1206.58" dur="4.89">FedEx was involved although we also know</text>
  <text start="1209.669" dur="3.691">that it was a FedEx employee that was a</text>
  <text start="1211.47" dur="3.66">whistleblower so it&amp;#39;s of estimated level</text>
  <text start="1213.36" dur="3.36">of involvement I&amp;#39;m not really sure but</text>
  <text start="1215.13" dur="3.509">it would seem if this person was saying</text>
  <text start="1216.72" dur="4.319">oh jeez I need to go to the other one</text>
  <text start="1218.639" dur="4.351">then they&amp;#39;ve probably done this before</text>
  <text start="1221.039" dur="3.931">meaning that whether whether they</text>
  <text start="1222.99" dur="3.659">knowingly we&amp;#39;re doing this or not they</text>
  <text start="1224.97" dur="2.429">most certainly were involved now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1226.649" dur="2.971">another center</text>
  <text start="1227.399" dur="4.5">it looks just south of here it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="1229.62" dur="4.89">the same distance and it is also a FedEx</text>
  <text start="1231.899" dur="3.961">on site okay so there you go and the</text>
  <text start="1234.51" dur="2.94">reason I wanted to tell this story was</text>
  <text start="1235.86" dur="3.529">twofold I actually wanted to tell it a</text>
  <text start="1237.45" dur="4.229">while back which was kind of an odd</text>
  <text start="1239.389" dur="4">coincidence because my story kinda was</text>
  <text start="1241.679" dur="4.261">coinciding with another story that I had</text>
  <text start="1243.389" dur="3.78">seen from amazing Polly on YouTube and</text>
  <text start="1245.94" dur="3">if you don&amp;#39;t follow her I highly suggest</text>
  <text start="1247.169" dur="3.99">that you do she does great stuff over</text>
  <text start="1248.94" dur="4.68">there and this was in regards to a video</text>
  <text start="1251.159" dur="4.26">that I had seen from her entitled you</text>
  <text start="1253.62" dur="3.75">won&amp;#39;t believe this coincidence and</text>
  <text start="1255.419" dur="3.571">that&amp;#39;s gonna be linked down below - now</text>
  <text start="1257.37" dur="3.24">I don&amp;#39;t want to rehash what she did I</text>
  <text start="1258.99" dur="3.27">cuz I really would love for you to just</text>
  <text start="1260.61" dur="4.319">go over there and see it so you can get</text>
  <text start="1262.26" dur="4.74">an understanding of this but the reason</text>
  <text start="1264.929" dur="4.291">that this kind of caught my attention at</text>
  <text start="1267" dur="4.649">the time was because when I was</text>
  <text start="1269.22" dur="5.4">researching this story the very same day</text>
  <text start="1271.649" dur="4.351">I saw her video and of course I wanted</text>
  <text start="1274.62" dur="4.08">to add on to them but she was talking</text>
  <text start="1276" dur="4.62">about this what started off talking</text>
  <text start="1278.7" dur="3.479">about this impossible whopper and of</text>
  <text start="1280.62" dur="3.929">course you know around here we like the</text>

  <text start="1293.19" dur="4.229">it&amp;#39;s one of these all plant type foods</text>
  <text start="1295.019" dur="4.65">that a lot of these these fast food</text>
  <text start="1297.419" dur="4.11">restaurants are starting to push you may</text>
  <text start="1299.669" dur="3.75">have noticed that KFC has even started</text>
  <text start="1301.529" dur="3.36">putting some of their franchises as a</text>
  <text start="1303.419" dur="4.35">painted green as opposed to their</text>
  <text start="1304.889" dur="5.01">typical red and white and they&amp;#39;re hoping</text>
  <text start="1307.769" dur="3.99">to even get off of chicken so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1309.899" dur="3.9">really really pushing this agenda now I</text>
  <text start="1311.759" dur="4.17">want to clarify once again even though I</text>
  <text start="1313.799" dur="4.44">did it last time and a whole bunch of</text>
  <text start="1315.929" dur="4.98">you vegans and vegetarians didn&amp;#39;t listen</text>
  <text start="1318.239" dur="5.79">I love you all you can eat whatever you</text>
  <text start="1320.909" dur="4.411">want I&amp;#39;m not anti vegan or vegetarians</text>
  <text start="1324.029" dur="3.451">matter of fact I think eating your</text>
  <text start="1325.32" dur="4.02">vegetables is a wonderful thing to do</text>
  <text start="1327.48" dur="4.319">however this is a little bit different</text>
  <text start="1329.34" dur="4.469">and she goes into this impossible</text>
  <text start="1331.799" dur="5.13">whopper and I don&amp;#39;t really want to talk</text>
  <text start="1333.809" dur="4.68">too much about this in in specifics but</text>
  <text start="1336.929" dur="3.36">it says no the whopper meat its twin the</text>
  <text start="1338.489" dur="4.32">impossible whopper is now available at</text>
  <text start="1340.289" dur="4.26">Burger King across America that&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="1342.809" dur="3.901">there&amp;#39;s a whopper made from plants with</text>
  <text start="1344.549" dur="3.84">your name on it and now it&amp;#39;s closer than</text>
  <text start="1346.71" dur="3.329">ever yeah well that might be really</text>
  <text start="1348.389" dur="4.14">telling there that it has your name on</text>
  <text start="1350.039" dur="5.431">it just saying so she goes on to talk</text>
  <text start="1352.529" dur="5.27">about impossible foods and how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1355.47" dur="4.409">sort of secret ingredient is this heme</text>
  <text start="1357.799" dur="4.51">supposed to be kind of to replicate</text>
  <text start="1359.879" dur="4.561">hemoglobin in blood and this is made</text>
  <text start="1362.309" dur="3.45">from a soybean and whatnot like I said I</text>
  <text start="1364.44" dur="3.75">really would love for you to go watch</text>
  <text start="1365.759" dur="3.841">her video and get this understanding</text>
  <text start="1368.19" dur="3.989">because this is gonna start popping up</text>
  <text start="1369.6" dur="4.679">around the planet we&amp;#39;re already seeing</text>
  <text start="1372.179" dur="4.891">it and of course the impossible whopper</text>
  <text start="1374.279" dur="4.5">is near and dear to my heart so I want</text>
  <text start="1377.07" dur="4.65">to add on to some things that she put in</text>
  <text start="1378.779" dur="4.951">her brilliant video but she last left us</text>
  <text start="1381.72" dur="3.99">here in Oakland and we&amp;#39;re back on the</text>
  <text start="1383.73" dur="3.48">googly maps as you can see pinged at the</text>
  <text start="1385.71" dur="3.27">top of your screen I got impossible</text>
  <text start="1387.21" dur="3.899">foods right there and she points out</text>
  <text start="1388.98" dur="3.87">that right across the stream is the</text>
  <text start="1391.109" dur="5.851">Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="1392.85" dur="5.459">yikes right across the street now also</text>
  <text start="1396.96" dur="4.14">right across the street is the Alameda</text>
  <text start="1398.309" dur="5.55">County social services but what I wanted</text>
  <text start="1401.1" dur="4.47">to point out was right behind here we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1403.859" dur="4.53">got this big big center with all these</text>
  <text start="1405.57" dur="5.339">trucky truckin tins nice what is that</text>
  <text start="1408.389" dur="3.841">well that happens to be FedEx and as you</text>
  <text start="1410.909" dur="2.73">can see I wanted to make the distinction</text>
  <text start="1412.23" dur="2.97">between one of these centers and the</text>
  <text start="1413.639" dur="3.061">on-site centers because you can see</text>
  <text start="1415.2" dur="3.479">there&amp;#39;s all those trucks there was</text>
  <text start="1416.7" dur="3.25">shipping going on right here so you can</text>
  <text start="1418.679" dur="4.151">get this stuff</text>
  <text start="1419.95" dur="4.89">and fresh right and then of course right</text>
  <text start="1422.83" dur="5.85">over here we&amp;#39;ve got the pet food Express</text>
  <text start="1424.84" dur="6.39">which doesn&amp;#39;t treat me out at all anyway</text>
  <text start="1428.68" dur="4.44">super uber creepy now upon watching her</text>
  <text start="1431.23" dur="3.57">video I wanted to see if they had any</text>
  <text start="1433.12" dur="3.84">other labs they have a second one in</text>
  <text start="1434.8" dur="3.96">Redwood City and it&amp;#39;s pinged at the top</text>
  <text start="1436.96" dur="3.6">of your map right there and it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="1438.76" dur="3.68">in this Medical Center and they also do</text>
  <text start="1440.56" dur="4.74">all sorts of kind of stem cell research</text>
  <text start="1442.44" dur="4.54">genetics DNA all that kind of stuff it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1445.3" dur="3.45">a whole little medical center there but</text>
  <text start="1446.98" dur="4.86">as you can see I&amp;#39;ve got the path here</text>
  <text start="1448.75" dur="5.58">and it looks to be what is that 3.1</text>
  <text start="1451.84" dur="3.96">miles if you go this way not too far a 9</text>
  <text start="1454.33" dur="4.89">minute drive to the Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="1455.8" dur="5.46">Redwood City now certainly they wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1459.22" dur="5.97">have themselves a FedEx shipping center</text>
  <text start="1461.26" dur="6.42">or would day it&amp;#39;s right over here that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1465.19" dur="5.19">right and it&amp;#39;s not another FedEx on-site</text>
  <text start="1467.68" dur="6.87">center I want to point out that it is a</text>
  <text start="1470.38" dur="7.14">FedEx shipping center so what we do know</text>
  <text start="1474.55" dur="6.12">is that FedEx was involved with this</text>
  <text start="1477.52" dur="5.34">whole stem Express situation now whether</text>
  <text start="1480.67" dur="4.59">or not they are involved with this whole</text>
  <text start="1482.86" dur="3.81">impossible food situation I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="1485.26" dur="3.63">know but I want to point out that their</text>
  <text start="1486.67" dur="4.71">two labs just happen to be next to you</text>
  <text start="1488.89" dur="5.25">not just on-site centers but FedEx</text>
  <text start="1491.38" dur="5.07">shipping centers and we do know that in</text>
  <text start="1494.14" dur="5.19">some way they were all three connected</text>
  <text start="1496.45" dur="4.32">now in regards to this impossible labs I</text>
  <text start="1499.33" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t really know what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1500.77" dur="4.44">evidently this team is made from this</text>
  <text start="1503.08" dur="3.78">soy bean I don&amp;#39;t know how they make it</text>
  <text start="1505.21" dur="2.79">red maybe they just died or whatever but</text>
  <text start="1506.86" dur="3.3">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s supposed to give it this</text>
  <text start="1508" dur="3.66">bloody meaty taste but I want to point</text>
  <text start="1510.16" dur="2.97">out that these labs are in medical</text>
  <text start="1511.66" dur="3.45">centers where they deal with DNA</text>
  <text start="1513.13" dur="4.71">genetics and they happen to be near</text>
  <text start="1515.11" dur="5.82">Planned Parenthood&amp;#39;s and FedEx shipping</text>
  <text start="1517.84" dur="4.68">centers so all in all I couldn&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="1520.93" dur="2.64">you what to do if you want to go down to</text>
  <text start="1522.52" dur="3.21">Burger King and grab yourself an</text>
