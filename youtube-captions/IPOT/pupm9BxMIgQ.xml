  <text start="145.91" dur="4.56">senator your reaction to all of this</text>
  <text start="147.37" dur="5.29">well I&amp;#39;ll be calling Horowitz before the</text>
  <text start="150.47" dur="3.96">country as a whole to let him go through</text>
  <text start="152.66" dur="4.02">his report tell us what happened with</text>
  <text start="154.43" dur="4.02">the FISA warrant application was the</text>
  <text start="156.68" dur="4.32">counterintelligence investigation</text>
  <text start="158.45" dur="4.98">properly opened was there any wrongdoing</text>
  <text start="161" dur="4.17">by DOJ and the FBI somebody&amp;#39;s got to</text>
  <text start="163.43" dur="4.17">watch those who watch us let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="165.17" dur="5.55">start with John Durham I talked to a US</text>
  <text start="167.6" dur="5.19">official that said this shift this move</text>
  <text start="170.72" dur="4.29">from an administrative review right now</text>
  <text start="172.79" dur="4.47">to a criminal inquiry is very</text>
  <text start="175.01" dur="4.199">significant and why because what we know</text>
  <text start="177.26" dur="3.9">is is that Attorney General William bar</text>
  <text start="179.209" dur="3.961">as well as John Durham have been</text>
  <text start="181.16" dur="4.14">traveling overseas they&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="183.17" dur="4.98">to intelligence officials our to our</text>
  <text start="185.3" dur="5.25">allies in Italy to others across the</text>
  <text start="188.15" dur="4.47">pond in London so there may be</text>
  <text start="190.55" dur="4.83">developments that we don&amp;#39;t know about</text>
  <text start="192.62" dur="4.589">yet that caused this shift that it moved</text>
  <text start="195.38" dur="4.02">directly from an administrative review</text>
  <text start="197.209" dur="4.89">to a criminal inquiry which will give</text>
  <text start="199.4" dur="4.949">John Durham the ability to subpoena to</text>
  <text start="202.099" dur="4.47">talk to witnesses to look at documents</text>
  <text start="204.349" dur="5.131">and to impanel a grand jury</text>
  <text start="206.569" dur="4.95">so this news is huge it&amp;#39;s significant</text>
  <text start="209.48" dur="4.05">and we&amp;#39;re also going to be looking at</text>
  <text start="211.519" dur="3.991">right now with Michael Horowitz the</text>
  <text start="213.53" dur="4.5">Inspector General if this report comes</text>
  <text start="215.51" dur="5.009">out shortly which we expect probably</text>
  <text start="218.03" dur="4.049">within the next week after going through</text>
  <text start="220.519" dur="3">all the classification review and</text>
  <text start="222.079" dur="4.08">markings and because they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="223.519" dur="5.22">releasing it in full with very few read</text>
  <text start="226.159" dur="4.771">actions that means that it&amp;#39;s moving</text>
  <text start="228.739" dur="4.65">forward Horowitz is moving forward at</text>
  <text start="230.93" dur="4.08">the same time we can see that the</text>
  <text start="233.389" dur="3.66">Attorney General that the Department of</text>
  <text start="235.01" dur="4.02">Justice that John Durham is moving</text>
  <text start="237.049" dur="3.42">forward with their investigation this</text>
  <text start="239.03" dur="2.97">means that somewhere along the lines</text>
  <text start="240.469" dur="3.42">were going to be having some information</text>
  <text start="242" dur="4.68">that we may not have had before and a</text>
  <text start="243.889" dur="4.44">reason for John Durham to actually open</text>
  <text start="246.68" dur="4.83">the criminal inquiry and remember that</text>
  <text start="248.329" dur="5.61">John Durham was actually questioning CIA</text>
  <text start="251.51" dur="4.319">officers as well that were closely</text>
  <text start="253.939" dur="3.66">connected to this and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="255.829" dur="4.41">be looking at John Brennan the former</text>
  <text start="257.599" dur="5.011">CIA director as well as James clapper</text>
  <text start="260.239" dur="5.071">and others so this may be the reason why</text>
  <text start="262.61" dur="4.739">we saw so many of them scrambling over</text>
  <text start="265.31" dur="4.8">the past year I&amp;#39;m sure they were aware</text>
  <text start="267.349" dur="3.961">of what was going on to some extent they</text>
  <text start="270.11" dur="3.899">knew that they were going to be</text>
  <text start="271.31" dur="4.59">questioned and now John Durham actually</text>
  <text start="274.009" dur="3.991">has the power to question all of them</text>
  <text start="275.9" dur="5.04">and this is very significant and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="278" dur="5.07">going to reveal a lot as to how far how</text>
  <text start="280.94" dur="4.62">far they weaponize the intelligence</text>
  <text start="283.07" dur="4.05">community to go after President Trump so</text>
  <text start="285.56" dur="4.289">there you go looks like Brennan and</text>
  <text start="287.12" dur="4.229">clapper should probably be luring up and</text>
  <text start="289.849" dur="3.421">I don&amp;#39;t imagine this is going to be</text>
  <text start="291.349" dur="3.841">public at least now we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="293.27" dur="3.75">hear anything publicly but looks like</text>
  <text start="295.19" dur="3.78">Durham wants to hear from both of these</text>
  <text start="297.02" dur="3.72">guys and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure they both knew</text>
  <text start="298.97" dur="3.15">about it after all both of them have</text>
  <text start="300.74" dur="3.72">been in the media for a long time</text>
  <text start="302.12" dur="5.43">working as analysts over there</text>
  <text start="304.46" dur="5.16">contributors at CNN and whatnot making</text>
  <text start="307.55" dur="3.989">the rounds in particular I&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="309.62" dur="3.599">thought James clapper was doing him very</text>
  <text start="311.539" dur="3.18">many favors as a matter of fact I think</text>
  <text start="313.219" dur="3.721">he&amp;#39;s been kind of trying to set the</text>
  <text start="314.719" dur="3.871">stage for a long time because he knows</text>
  <text start="316.94" dur="2.909">that he&amp;#39;s directly implicated in this</text>
  <text start="318.59" dur="3.299">and that this is going to come right</text>
  <text start="319.849" dur="4.051">back to him and of course we know that</text>
  <text start="321.889" dur="3.391">John Brennan was our Orchestrator we</text>
  <text start="323.9" dur="2.85">talked a lot about that in the last</text>
  <text start="325.28" dur="3.93">video here entitled whistleblower</text>
  <text start="326.75" dur="4.229">charmella big thanks to Gregg Roubini on</text>
  <text start="329.21" dur="4.11">Twitter over there who did some great</text>
  <text start="330.979" dur="3.891">great work but we can see that this all</text>
  <text start="333.32" dur="3.29">came from John Brennan</text>
  <text start="334.87" dur="3.09">and John Brennan knows this too and</text>
  <text start="336.61" dur="3.839">that&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s been out there setting</text>
  <text start="337.96" dur="4.8">the stage so like I said don&amp;#39;t imagine</text>
  <text start="340.449" dur="4.051">this is going to go public at least not</text>
  <text start="342.76" dur="3.93">right now but Durham wants to know</text>
  <text start="344.5" dur="4.229">what&amp;#39;s up and it looks like the game has</text>
  <text start="346.69" dur="4.56">changed in regards to this being a</text>
  <text start="348.729" dur="4.771">criminal investigation being able to</text>
  <text start="351.25" dur="4.68">form grand juries should be a very very</text>
  <text start="353.5" dur="5.1">big part picking up some pace here now</text>
  <text start="355.93" dur="4.17">in regards to the Horowitz report I just</text>
  <text start="358.6" dur="3.81">want to say I remain cautiously</text>
  <text start="360.1" dur="4.289">optimistic about this whole you know</text>
  <text start="362.41" dur="3.6">next week kind of thing don&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="364.389" dur="3.961">surprised if the goalposts get move on</text>
  <text start="366.01" dur="5.04">that too and of course Lindsey Graham he</text>
  <text start="368.35" dur="5.76">seems all really really all interested</text>
  <text start="371.05" dur="4.47">in bringing in Rudy Giuliani but he</text>
  <text start="374.11" dur="3.66">doesn&amp;#39;t seem to want to talk to clapper</text>
  <text start="375.52" dur="4.47">or Brandon and of course I think we all</text>
  <text start="377.77" dur="3.63">know that this is probably going to be</text>
  <text start="379.99" dur="3.81">the end of the road pretty soon for</text>
  <text start="381.4" dur="5.16">Lindsey Graham too we know that he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="383.8" dur="4.679">probably the you know real reason that</text>
  <text start="386.56" dur="4.229">anything is going to get pushed forward</text>
  <text start="388.479" dur="3.75">he&amp;#39;s just there to Stonewall and tell us</text>
  <text start="390.789" dur="3.6">what we want to hear for a little bit</text>
  <text start="392.229" dur="4.921">but either way looks like it&amp;#39;s time to</text>

  <text start="655.18" dur="5.219">the news broke attributed to senior</text>

  <text start="667.35" dur="6.04">overnight the most important substantive</text>
  <text start="670.42" dur="5.64">changes were made to the Flynn 302 those</text>
  <text start="673.39" dur="5.43">changes added an unequivocal statement</text>
  <text start="676.06" dur="5.31">that Flynn stated he did not in response</text>
  <text start="678.82" dur="4.65">to whether mr. Flynn had asked his lyac</text>
  <text start="681.37" dur="4.65">to vote in a certain manner or slow down</text>
  <text start="683.47" dur="4.59">the UN vote this is a deceptive</text>
  <text start="686.02" dur="4.379">manipulation because as the notes of the</text>
  <text start="688.06" dur="3.93">agents show mr. Flynn was not even sure</text>
  <text start="690.399" dur="4.231">he had spoken to Russia</text>
  <text start="691.99" dur="4.44">kiss lyac on this issue yeah so if he</text>
  <text start="694.63" dur="3.3">wasn&amp;#39;t even sure that he had talked to</text>
  <text start="696.43" dur="3.779">him in the first place how would he know</text>
  <text start="697.93" dur="4.77">unequivocally whether he said he did or</text>
  <text start="700.209" dur="4.981">did not now here&amp;#39;s some more here second</text>
  <text start="702.7" dur="4.889">they added or if kissy lyac described</text>
  <text start="705.19" dur="4.86">any Russian response to a request by</text>
  <text start="707.589" dur="4.44">Flynn that question and answer do not</text>
  <text start="710.05" dur="4.11">appear in the notes yet it was made into</text>
  <text start="712.029" dur="4.771">a criminal offence now we&amp;#39;re in section</text>
  <text start="714.16" dur="4.679">4 here the final 302 falsely states that</text>
  <text start="716.8" dur="4.229">mr. Flynn remembered making four to five</text>
  <text start="718.839" dur="4.861">calls from the Dominican Republic when</text>
  <text start="721.029" dur="5.071">both sets of notes state he does not</text>
  <text start="723.7" dur="4.68">remember and this is the quote I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="726.1" dur="4.08">remember making four to five calls if I</text>
  <text start="728.38" dur="4.89">did lousy placed a call</text>
  <text start="730.18" dur="5.78">the final 302 states the opposite Flynn</text>
  <text start="733.27" dur="5.3">remembered making four to five calls to</text>
  <text start="735.96" dur="4.38">day about this issue but that the</text>
  <text start="738.57" dur="3.66">Dominican Republic was a difficult place</text>
  <text start="740.34" dur="4.05">to make a call and as he kept having</text>
  <text start="742.23" dur="3.93">connectivity issues okay well that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="744.39" dur="3.42">what he said at all okay finally let me</text>
  <text start="746.16" dur="3.6">leave you with this page didn&amp;#39;t recall</text>
  <text start="747.81" dur="4.17">whether she took part in editing the 302</text>
  <text start="749.76" dur="4.53">of the Flint interview but upon seeing a</text>
  <text start="751.98" dur="5.4">text message and the email of February</text>
  <text start="754.29" dur="4.77">10 2017 she believes she must have seen</text>
  <text start="757.38" dur="3.66">it at some point in the process yeah</text>
  <text start="759.06" dur="4.56">probably the part where you edited it</text>
  <text start="761.04" dur="4.92">and put it on bill priest apps desk for</text>
  <text start="763.62" dur="4.62">Peter struck to find it like we just saw</text>
  <text start="765.96" dur="4.35">in these text messages so this is very</text>
  <text start="768.24" dur="3.66">big Sidney Powell has known about this</text>
  <text start="770.31" dur="3.39">to be big I&amp;#39;m sure Flint of course knew</text>
  <text start="771.9" dur="3.39">about this and this is likely why</text>
  <text start="773.7" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;ve never even bothered to change</text>
  <text start="775.29" dur="4.62">the plea because when we see this this</text>
  <text start="777.84" dur="4.59">is really going to discredit the whole</text>
  <text start="779.91" dur="5.1">investigation and keep in mind the guy</text>
  <text start="782.43" dur="5.64">who took Flynn&amp;#39;s plea was a buddy of</text>
  <text start="785.01" dur="5.94">Peter struck so this whole thing is an</text>

  <text start="1140.43" dur="4.11">went on this search and of course during</text>
  <text start="1142.98" dur="4.74">the military skills competition that</text>
  <text start="1144.54" dur="4.62">could be tons of you know tons of area</text>
  <text start="1147.72" dur="3.36">that you could be covering anyway you</text>
  <text start="1149.16" dur="4.56">could get lost doing a military skills</text>
  <text start="1151.08" dur="4.47">competition I&amp;#39;m very aware of that but</text>
  <text start="1153.72" dur="3.99">they ended up switching the search</text>
  <text start="1155.55" dur="4.68">because nothing was being used no phone</text>
  <text start="1157.71" dur="4.41">or no kinds of purchasers or anything</text>
  <text start="1160.23" dur="4.59">like that online and they went back and</text>
  <text start="1162.12" dur="4.56">they found him on the base they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1164.82" dur="3.9">really stated anymore since then but let</text>
  <text start="1166.68" dur="3.75">me point out a couple more unusual</text>
  <text start="1168.72" dur="3.63">things about this I&amp;#39;m over here on</text>
  <text start="1170.43" dur="3.48">Twitter and as you can see this is an</text>
  <text start="1172.35" dur="2.94">article from The Daily Mail we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1173.91" dur="3.12">going to go into it but you can see on</text>
  <text start="1175.29" dur="4.26">the right there is the only other</text>
  <text start="1177.03" dur="5.46">picture I&amp;#39;ve seen so far of this kurta</text>
  <text start="1179.55" dur="4.62">he is presenting a picture to actor</text>
  <text start="1182.49" dur="3.54">Stephen Lang that&amp;#39;s a picture of West</text>
  <text start="1184.17" dur="5.16">Point and this happened just two weeks</text>
  <text start="1186.03" dur="4.95">before this event but this went on for</text>
  <text start="1189.33" dur="3.78">quite some time and I just find it very</text>
  <text start="1190.98" dur="4.77">strange as we kind of scroll through</text>
  <text start="1193.11" dur="4.89">here you&amp;#39;re gonna see that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1195.75" dur="6.21">essentially the same picture over and</text>
  <text start="1198" dur="6.33">over again and every single one of these</text>
  <text start="1201.96" dur="5.04">platforms is telling us the same story</text>
  <text start="1204.33" dur="4.53">I&amp;#39;m not being offered anything new this</text>
  <text start="1207" dur="3.27">guy&amp;#39;s been missing for long enough you</text>
  <text start="1208.86" dur="5.34">would think that we&amp;#39;d find out more</text>
  <text start="1210.27" dur="6.6">information it looks all too neat and</text>
  <text start="1214.2" dur="4.17">once again I am NOT suggesting that</text>
  <text start="1216.87" dur="3.3">something&amp;#39;s wrong I&amp;#39;m just suggesting</text>
  <text start="1218.37" dur="4.74">that as somebody who covers these</text>
  <text start="1220.17" dur="6.51">stories all the time sometimes stories</text>
  <text start="1223.11" dur="6.63">seem to neatly wrapped up but either way</text>
  <text start="1226.68" dur="4.23">this guy was found on the base and we</text>
  <text start="1229.74" dur="3.57">don&amp;#39;t know if he was murdered and</text>
  <text start="1230.91" dur="4.62">there&amp;#39;s been no mention whether or not</text>
  <text start="1233.31" dur="4.32">they ever recovered the rifle and that</text>
  <text start="1235.53" dur="4.92">would seem like something that the</text>
  <text start="1237.63" dur="5.19">military academy would want to you know</text>
  <text start="1240.45" dur="3.87">kind of follow up on us so we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="1242.82" dur="3.72">seeing the same thing over again the</text>
  <text start="1244.32" dur="3.36">same picture same story as you can see</text>
  <text start="1246.54" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;re just going through but wait a</text>
  <text start="1247.68" dur="3.66">minute who&amp;#39;s that right there seems like</text>
  <text start="1249.72" dur="3.9">one of the few politicians that weighed</text>
  <text start="1251.34" dur="3.99">in was Chuck Schumer who says I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1253.62" dur="3.12">heartbroken to hear the news about cadet</text>
  <text start="1255.33" dur="3.48">cadet Corita I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="1256.74" dur="4.14">of your cabe I&amp;#39;m praying for his family</text>
  <text start="1258.81" dur="3.69">his fellow cadets and everyone who knew</text>
  <text start="1260.88" dur="4.02">and loved him and I&amp;#39;m grateful for the</text>
  <text start="1262.5" dur="4.38">first responders who act so quickly to</text>
  <text start="1264.9" dur="5.25">provide immediate assistance to West</text>
  <text start="1266.88" dur="5.01">Point so all I want to point out</text>
  <text start="1270.15" dur="3.96">is that this is a very neatly wrapped up</text>
  <text start="1271.89" dur="4.17">story we don&amp;#39;t have any word of the</text>
  <text start="1274.11" dur="3.96">rifle how he died they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1276.06" dur="3.3">foul play but if his gun is missing it</text>
  <text start="1278.07" dur="3.09">would be nice to know if we at least</text>
  <text start="1279.36" dur="3.21">found it it&amp;#39;s possible that they could</text>
  <text start="1281.16" dur="1.74">have found it and maybe just didn&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="1282.57" dur="2.04">us</text>
  <text start="1282.9" dur="3.72">but after covering a lot of these</text>
  <text start="1284.61" dur="3.54">stories not necessarily likely and then</text>
  <text start="1286.62" dur="3.51">of course the only politician that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1288.15" dur="5.64">really seeing here right off the bat is</text>
  <text start="1290.13" dur="6.99">Chuck Schumer weighing in and finally</text>
  <text start="1293.79" dur="6.3">let me leave you with some heartwarming</text>
