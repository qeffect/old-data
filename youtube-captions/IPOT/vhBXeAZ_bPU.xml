  <text start="39.71" dur="4.29">your host Sir Patrick Mack ladies and</text>
  <text start="41.81" dur="4.94">gentlemen we caught ourselves a spy and</text>
  <text start="44" dur="7.619">the spy was at the pool</text>
  <text start="46.75" dur="4.869">[Music]</text>
  <text start="53.22" dur="4.47">I didn&amp;#39;t check the filter did you check</text>
  <text start="55.89" dur="3.24">the I didn&amp;#39;t check the filter we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="57.69" dur="2.91">gonna talk about that story in just a</text>
  <text start="59.13" dur="4.53">minute but let me start you over here on</text>
  <text start="60.6" dur="5.7">Twitter this is a tweet from methods @m</text>
  <text start="63.66" dur="4.56">to madness on Twitter and if you&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="66.3" dur="3.75">Twitter I highly suggest giving methods</text>
  <text start="68.22" dur="4.83">a follow always great stories and</text>
  <text start="70.05" dur="4.62">Twitter wisdom when I call twisdom and</text>
  <text start="73.05" dur="3.96">here&amp;#39;s some of that wisdom if somehow</text>
  <text start="74.67" dur="4.74">9/11 occurred now instead of back then</text>
  <text start="77.01" dur="4.44">we would have organized research vids</text>
  <text start="79.41" dur="3.42">connections within hours and then we</text>
  <text start="81.45" dur="3.69">would proceed to debunk the war</text>
  <text start="82.83" dur="4.5">mongering narratives by the MSM etc</text>
  <text start="85.14" dur="4.35">seeing footage from 9/11 reminds me of</text>
  <text start="87.33" dur="3.39">why we fight every day for the truth</text>
  <text start="89.49" dur="2.4">that&amp;#39;s very true I don&amp;#39;t think they</text>
  <text start="90.72" dur="4.23">would be able to pull it off at this</text>
  <text start="91.89" dur="4.89">point and you know I chimed in that some</text>
  <text start="94.95" dur="3">of us did that back then although not in</text>
  <text start="96.78" dur="2.94">the same numbers that&amp;#39;s really true and</text>
  <text start="97.95" dur="3.36">that maybe some of you not really sure</text>
  <text start="99.72" dur="2.61">where you are in your stage of this</text>
  <text start="101.31" dur="2.34">journey and it really doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="102.33" dur="4.32">because we&amp;#39;re always we&amp;#39;re all here</text>
  <text start="103.65" dur="4.23">together but yeah some of us were really</text>
  <text start="106.65" dur="2.64">doing a lot of this stuff back then and</text>
  <text start="107.88" dur="4.349">it was even tougher because we had less</text>
  <text start="109.29" dur="5.43">to work with and of course the internet</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="4.53">was just not as effective of tool as it</text>
  <text start="114.72" dur="3.209">is now and of course we didn&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="116.759" dur="3.601">really the strength our true strength</text>
  <text start="117.929" dur="4.47">which is our strength in numbers which</text>
  <text start="120.36" dur="3.66">is all of you we were hated for it we</text>
  <text start="122.399" dur="3.211">were hated now but there&amp;#39;s so many more</text>
  <text start="124.02" dur="3.72">of us thanks for that Patriots some</text>
  <text start="125.61" dur="4.619">people did some I haven&amp;#39;t forgotten</text>
  <text start="127.74" dur="4.02">indeed and you know I want to say this I</text>
  <text start="130.229" dur="3.691">don&amp;#39;t really want to rehash 9/11 too</text>
  <text start="131.76" dur="4.2">much today I want to move forward it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="133.92" dur="3.93">always a tough day but you know back</text>
  <text start="135.96" dur="3.63">then it was tough discussing it without</text>
  <text start="137.85" dur="3.9">getting a lot of anger really towards</text>
  <text start="139.59" dur="3.51">from your own Patriot friends and</text>
  <text start="141.75" dur="3.15">whatnot and I think a lot of that is</text>
  <text start="143.1" dur="3.45">changing now if there&amp;#39;s something really</text>
  <text start="144.9" dur="3.69">good to be taken away from all of us is</text>
  <text start="146.55" dur="3.39">that yeah so much of that sentiment now</text>
  <text start="148.59" dur="3.21">is changing more and more people are</text>
  <text start="149.94" dur="3.3">waking up we&amp;#39;re really starting to score</text>
  <text start="151.8" dur="3.12">a lot of victories we&amp;#39;re gonna talk</text>
  <text start="153.24" dur="3.84">about some of those victories but I</text>
  <text start="154.92" dur="3.6">wanted to say thanks to methods and I</text>
  <text start="157.08" dur="3.48">want to say thanks to all of you those</text>

  <text start="160.56" dur="3.84">videos or do whatever it is that you do</text>

  <text start="196.05" dur="4.36">allegedly withheld by the government</text>
  <text start="198.4" dur="3.93">including a memo from the British</text>
  <text start="200.41" dur="4.53">government that said to warn about the</text>

  <text start="241.99" dur="5.64">calls his credibility into question and</text>
  <text start="244.11" dur="4.9">declares him untrustworthy Fox News has</text>
  <text start="247.63" dur="3.57">reached out to the British Embassy and</text>
  <text start="249.01" dur="5.28">an attorney for rice for comments about</text>
  <text start="251.2" dur="4.71">the claim nevertheless the FBI relied on</text>

  <text start="271.21" dur="3.27">let me jump over here real quick and</text>
  <text start="272.47" dur="3.75">show you what this is all about here</text>
  <text start="274.48" dur="5.01">here it is United States of America a</text>
  <text start="276.22" dur="5.46">plaintiff versus Michael T Flynn I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="279.49" dur="4.83">know TIFF is but I&amp;#39;m sure she&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="281.68" dur="3.75">unique qualities of her own - no I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="284.32" dur="3.96">just kidding the United States of</text>
  <text start="285.43" dur="4.77">America is the plaintiff now let me take</text>
  <text start="288.28" dur="4.53">you down to this part right here under</text>
  <text start="290.2" dur="5.07">the background because the government is</text>
  <text start="292.81" dur="4.08">supposed to pursue justice not nearly</text>
  <text start="295.27" dur="3.99">convictions its responsibility to</text>
  <text start="296.89" dur="5.07">produce Brady material is a grave one</text>
  <text start="299.26" dur="5.52">Brady material be essentially meaning by</text>
  <text start="301.96" dur="4.8">the way of the Brady order anytime a</text>
  <text start="304.78" dur="3.72">prosecution is in possession of some</text>
  <text start="306.76" dur="2.92">sort of exculpatory evidence they must</text>
  <text start="308.5" dur="3.4">be able to provide it otherwise</text>
  <text start="309.68" dur="5.37">not really providing a fair trial for</text>
  <text start="311.9" dur="5.04">somebody and you can just sort of leave</text>
  <text start="315.05" dur="3.78">people guilty before proven innocent</text>
  <text start="316.94" dur="4.17">right it&amp;#39;s a grave one its scope</text>
  <text start="318.83" dur="4.08">wide-ranging and its duration ongoing</text>
  <text start="321.11" dur="3.66">indeed this Court has entered both an</text>
  <text start="322.91" dur="7.11">initial standing order to produce Brady</text>
  <text start="324.77" dur="8.28">material on December 12 2017 and an</text>
  <text start="330.02" dur="4.769">updated order on February 16th 2018</text>
  <text start="333.05" dur="3.27">making it clear to the government that</text>
  <text start="334.789" dur="3.391">its duty to provide to produce</text>
  <text start="336.32" dur="4.29">exculpatory evidence exists</text>
  <text start="338.18" dur="4.38">independently of mr. Flynn&amp;#39;s guilty plea</text>
  <text start="340.61" dur="3.57">and that Duty is not expired okay so</text>
  <text start="342.56" dur="3.72">long story short we&amp;#39;ve asked you for</text>
  <text start="344.18" dur="5.31">this stuff before a couple of times and</text>
  <text start="346.28" dur="5.46">you blew us off yet when under siding</text>
  <text start="349.49" dur="4.23">new counsel for mr. Flynn requested a</text>
  <text start="351.74" dur="4.2">detailed list of outstanding Brady</text>
  <text start="353.72" dur="4.62">material immediately upon taking over</text>
  <text start="355.94" dur="8.97">from the prior counsel mr. Van grat</text>
  <text start="358.34" dur="10.859">glibly responded a few weeks later yeah</text>
  <text start="364.91" dur="6.45">Matt you&amp;#39;re glib On June 26 2009 writing</text>
  <text start="369.199" dur="4.701">blah blah blah blah blah essentially</text>
  <text start="371.36" dur="4.799">saying that because of the plea that</text>
  <text start="373.9" dur="5.62">general Flynn was essentially coerced</text>
  <text start="376.159" dur="5.13">into giving that waived his rights for</text>
  <text start="379.52" dur="4.74">any additional disclosure of information</text>
  <text start="381.289" dur="4.831">which is pretty suspect also given the</text>
  <text start="384.26" dur="4.26">material defense counsel is requested</text>
  <text start="386.12" dur="4.169">which remains outstanding mr. van graffs</text>
  <text start="388.52" dur="3.45">denial that further Brady material</text>
  <text start="390.289" dur="3.241">exists is patently absurd it</text>
  <text start="391.97" dur="2.91">demonstrates arrogance and utter</text>
  <text start="393.53" dur="3.75">contempt for the letter and the spirit</text>
  <text start="394.88" dur="4.259">of this Court&amp;#39;s elicit order the rule of</text>
  <text start="397.28" dur="3.72">Brady vs. Maryland and the protections</text>
  <text start="399.139" dur="4.59">guaranteed defendants by the US</text>
  <text start="401" dur="5.4">Constitution in fact just last week mr.</text>
  <text start="403.729" dur="4.41">Van grack produced an additional 330</text>
  <text start="406.4" dur="3.42">pages that included information that any</text>
  <text start="408.139" dur="3.661">reasonable attorney would understand as</text>
  <text start="409.82" dur="3.18">Brady evidence in light of special</text>
  <text start="411.8" dur="2.76">counsels investigation</text>
  <text start="413" dur="4.139">and assertions that mr. Flynn was</text>
  <text start="414.56" dur="5.729">undisclosed agent of Russia or an agent</text>
  <text start="417.139" dur="4.5">of so really essentially they were</text>
  <text start="420.289" dur="2.671">saying that they didn&amp;#39;t have any more</text>
  <text start="421.639" dur="3.09">and because of the plea deal they</text>
  <text start="422.96" dur="3.78">weren&amp;#39;t gonna call up any more even</text>
  <text start="424.729" dur="5.101">though they coughed up 330 pages and</text>
  <text start="426.74" dur="5.16">there is a lot of stuff right here and I</text>
  <text start="429.83" dur="3.929">just want to kind of peruse through it a</text>
  <text start="431.9" dur="3.57">little bit cuz there&amp;#39;s so much but let</text>
  <text start="433.759" dur="3.15">me take you down to section 2 the</text>
  <text start="435.47" dur="3.24">government must be compelled to produce</text>

  <text start="465.42" dur="3.27">yeah it looks like some of this</text>
  <text start="466.77" dur="3.81">information showed that mr. Flynn went</text>
  <text start="468.69" dur="3.42">through all the channels saying exactly</text>
  <text start="470.58" dur="4.23">what he was gonna do who he was gonna</text>
  <text start="472.11" dur="5.94">meet and they just kind of failed to</text>
  <text start="474.81" dur="4.83">COFF all that up these prosecutors are</text>
  <text start="478.05" dur="3.42">still suppressing evidence that he did</text>

  <text start="593.8" dur="4.11">extremely thorough</text>
  <text start="595.36" dur="4.71">Sydnee power is extremely thorough and</text>
  <text start="597.91" dur="3.72">we have her to thank for a lot of this</text>
  <text start="600.07" dur="3.51">so it looks like they&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="601.63" dur="6.51">call something up or there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="603.58" dur="6.36">a price to pay at the DOJ now back to</text>
  <text start="608.14" dur="3.81">the Fox article Flynn lawyer Sidney</text>
  <text start="609.94" dur="4.29">Powell convinced US District Court Judge</text>
  <text start="611.95" dur="3.87">Emmett Sullivan to schedule a hearing on</text>
  <text start="614.23" dur="3.69">whether so-called Brady material</text>
  <text start="615.82" dur="4.17">evidence helpful to the defense was</text>
  <text start="617.92" dur="4.14">unconstitutionally withheld and we just</text>
  <text start="619.99" dur="3.99">saw how much there really really was</text>
  <text start="622.06" dur="3.84">this would basically blow the doors off</text>
  <text start="623.98" dur="3.87">this whole investigation right the</text>
  <text start="625.9" dur="3.84">developments come ahead of a scheduled</text>
  <text start="627.85" dur="3.84">December sentencing day which Sullivan</text>
  <text start="629.74" dur="4.56">warned the parties could be moved again</text>
  <text start="631.69" dur="4.68">okay so we&amp;#39;ve seen this before we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="634.3" dur="4.62">seen general Flynn&amp;#39;s sentencing get</text>
  <text start="636.37" dur="5.7">moved a few times and of course when</text>
  <text start="638.92" dur="5.64">Sullivan took over he was kind of you</text>
  <text start="642.07" dur="4.32">know trying to convince general Flynn to</text>
  <text start="644.56" dur="3.33">change his plea are you sure you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="646.39" dur="3.48">want to change your plea but they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="647.89" dur="3.3">been very very adamant and when Sidney</text>
  <text start="649.87" dur="2.85">Powell has been interviewed about it -</text>
  <text start="651.19" dur="4.14">she skirted that question - saying</text>
  <text start="652.72" dur="4.05">there&amp;#39;s no real need to change their</text>
  <text start="655.33" dur="3.27">plea because what she&amp;#39;s planning on</text>
  <text start="656.77" dur="4.56">doing it&amp;#39;s just like I said blowing a</text>
  <text start="658.6" dur="5.49">lid off the whole dang thing and you</text>
  <text start="661.33" dur="4.11">know that&amp;#39;s much more powerful than you</text>
  <text start="664.09" dur="2.82">know pardoning somebody or something</text>
  <text start="665.44" dur="3.81">like that but really just dismissing the</text>
  <text start="666.91" dur="4.95">entire case that&amp;#39;s the real win that we</text>
  <text start="669.25" dur="4.92">want to see but in addition to that this</text>
  <text start="671.86" dur="5.43">is going to lead into all the FISA abuse</text>
  <text start="674.17" dur="5.85">and this is basically how you get all</text>
  <text start="677.29" dur="4.74">this evidence legally injected right so</text>
  <text start="680.02" dur="3.9">kudos to Sidney power let&amp;#39;s move on</text>
  <text start="682.03" dur="3.51">though this is the real kicker was this</text>
  <text start="683.92" dur="4.38">letter we&amp;#39;ve learned that there was a</text>
  <text start="685.54" dur="5.13">letter dated January 30th 2017 or an</text>
  <text start="688.3" dur="5.13">internal memo from the DOJ that</text>
  <text start="690.67" dur="5.1">completely exonerates mr. Flynn of being</text>
  <text start="693.43" dur="4.35">an agent of Russia and that document has</text>
  <text start="695.77" dur="3.63">not been produced to us yet</text>
  <text start="697.78" dur="3.87">well that document and that document</text>
  <text start="699.4" dur="4.89">alone sounds like it&amp;#39;s enough to go</text>
  <text start="701.65" dur="3.99">ahead and exonerate mr. Flynn but at the</text>
  <text start="704.29" dur="2.93">same time you saw how much they were</text>
  <text start="705.64" dur="3.11">really requesting and you</text>
  <text start="707.22" dur="3.659">see how much they&amp;#39;ve really been hiding</text>
  <text start="708.75" dur="3.48">from us Powell continued so they had a</text>
  <text start="710.879" dur="3.301">lot of information that they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="712.23" dur="3.419">disclose they also had knowledge of a</text>
  <text start="714.18" dur="3.659">letter from the British Embassy that</text>
  <text start="715.649" dur="4.711">completely discredit Trump dossier</text>
  <text start="717.839" dur="5.19">author Christopher steel and undoes the</text>
  <text start="720.36" dur="4.349">whole steel dossier debacle and of</text>
  <text start="723.029" dur="5.221">course we know that that not only does</text>
  <text start="724.709" dur="5.73">that clear Trump and Flint but it starts</text>
  <text start="728.25" dur="3.839">the ball rolling in the other direction</text>
  <text start="730.439" dur="3.15">so there you go remains to be seen how</text>
  <text start="732.089" dur="4.081">it all plays out but it seems to be</text>
  <text start="733.589" dur="5.04">coinciding with the upcoming IG report</text>
  <text start="736.17" dur="4.109">that we still keep hearing about Lindsey</text>
  <text start="738.629" dur="2.88">Graham was on Hannity talking about it</text>
  <text start="740.279" dur="2.79">he mentioned a couple interesting things</text>
  <text start="741.509" dur="9.93">here that I want to point out check it</text>
  <text start="743.069" dur="10.921">out but I can promise you this Shawn the</text>
  <text start="751.439" dur="5.01">Senate Judiciary Committee will call mr.</text>
  <text start="753.99" dur="4.92">Horowitz and he will testify under oath</text>
  <text start="756.449" dur="4.38">about his report and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="758.91" dur="4.469">pursue this in a transparent fashion</text>
  <text start="760.829" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;re going to declassify as much as we</text>
  <text start="763.379" dur="3.57">can including the FISA warrant</text>
  <text start="765.089" dur="4.98">applications I&amp;#39;m going to give you all</text>
  <text start="766.949" dur="6.591">the information that was in the system</text>
  <text start="770.069" dur="6.541">about how suspicious people were of</text>
  <text start="773.54" dur="5.37">Christopher Steele how biased he was let</text>
  <text start="776.61" dur="4.979">you read it for it for yourself</text>
  <text start="778.91" dur="6.01">transparency and accountability is my</text>
  <text start="781.589" dur="4.44">goal well kind of ducked my question</text>
  <text start="784.92" dur="3.029">well I&amp;#39;m not trying to put a lot of</text>
  <text start="786.029" dur="3.831">pressure on you here I don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="787.949" dur="4.771">he&amp;#39;s gonna say also make sure that</text>

  <text start="798.059" dur="5.7">wiretapping President Trump after the</text>
  <text start="801" dur="5.009">election to me that is a very chilling</text>
  <text start="803.759" dur="4.26">moment in American history to have a</text>
  <text start="806.009" dur="5.221">conversation between the acting Attorney</text>

  <text start="811.23" dur="3.57">wiretapping the President of the United</text>
  <text start="812.97" dur="3.57">States so there you go this will be</text>
  <text start="814.8" dur="3.599">interesting to see who ends up going</text>
  <text start="816.54" dur="4.26">first is it going to be McCabe rod Rowe</text>
  <text start="818.399" dur="4.17">it should be quite the show but we do</text>
  <text start="820.8" dur="5.07">know that between the two of them and</text>
  <text start="822.569" dur="5.7">James nobodies homi Comey somebody is</text>
  <text start="825.87" dur="4.05">not telling the truth right so what was</text>
  <text start="828.269" dur="3.51">this whole story with wiretapping the</text>
  <text start="829.92" dur="4.08">president and hopefully this will be</text>
  <text start="831.779" dur="4.081">something that will sort of bend the ear</text>
  <text start="834" dur="3.48">of the average American when they</text>
  <text start="835.86" dur="3.329">finally realized that a lot of this</text>
  <text start="837.48" dur="2.48">stuff was bunk and now these guys are</text>

  <text start="1172.77" dur="3.6">and Jung never was never near him okay</text>
  <text start="1175.35" dur="3.39">so I want to point out if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1176.37" dur="4.77">remember this story she got to the gate</text>
  <text start="1178.74" dur="4.8">and what&amp;#39;s really suspicious about this</text>
  <text start="1181.14" dur="4.29">is that they didn&amp;#39;t turn her away she</text>
  <text start="1183.54" dur="3.9">said she was there for a pool party for</text>
  <text start="1185.43" dur="3.99">this Chinese Friendship Association they</text>

  <text start="1189.42" dur="3.84">she got to the gate she was pretending</text>
  <text start="1190.92" dur="4.23">like she didn&amp;#39;t speak much English and</text>
  <text start="1193.26" dur="3.6">of course that changed what she got</text>
  <text start="1195.15" dur="3.45">inside but the fact the matter she got</text>
  <text start="1196.86" dur="4.8">way through because of this supposed a</text>
  <text start="1198.6" dur="4.77">language barrier but that right there</text>
  <text start="1201.66" dur="3.54">should have been a red flag so it seems</text>
  <text start="1203.37" dur="5.07">to me like somebody who let her in was</text>
  <text start="1205.2" dur="5.13">either you know lazy or part you know</text>
  <text start="1208.44" dur="4.65">maybe in on the situation but either way</text>
  <text start="1210.33" dur="4.2">she got in agent crystal Kerr testified</text>
  <text start="1213.09" dur="3.39">Zhang said she was there to visit the</text>
  <text start="1214.53" dur="3.33">pool mar-a-lago managers thought she</text>
  <text start="1216.48" dur="3.12">might be the daughter of a member named</text>
  <text start="1217.86" dur="4.16">Zhang and admitted her and Zhang is a</text>
  <text start="1219.6" dur="5.16">pretty common name so it&amp;#39;s not unusual</text>
  <text start="1222.02" dur="4.81">receptions receptionist Ariella groomers</text>
  <text start="1224.76" dur="3.45">testified that she immediately spotted</text>
  <text start="1226.83" dur="3.12">Zhang as an outsider</text>
  <text start="1228.21" dur="3.27">Grima says that she knows the five</text>
  <text start="1229.95" dur="3.57">hundred members and most of their guests</text>
  <text start="1231.48" dur="4.83">and Zhang was taking photos in the lobby</text>
  <text start="1233.52" dur="4.599">which is prohibited she also said yung</text>
  <text start="1236.31" dur="4.029">was wearing a long gray evening dress</text>
  <text start="1238.119" dur="5.13">at 1:00 p.m. which seems odd especially</text>
  <text start="1240.339" dur="5.22">for a pool party guma said she stopped</text>
  <text start="1243.249" dur="4.35">young as she tried to walk past her into</text>
  <text start="1245.559" dur="4.53">another room Zhang told her she was</text>
  <text start="1247.599" dur="5.19">there for the UN event but cromoz no</text>
  <text start="1250.089" dur="4.89">such event was scheduled goomahs alerted</text>
  <text start="1252.789" dur="4.56">The Secret Service agent Sam Ivanovich</text>
  <text start="1254.979" dur="4.5">testified Zhang told him she was there</text>
  <text start="1257.349" dur="3.93">for a Chinese American event and showed</text>
  <text start="1259.479" dur="3.93">him an invitation in Mandarin which he</text>
  <text start="1261.279" dur="4.71">doesn&amp;#39;t speak he said in a search showed</text>
  <text start="1263.409" dur="5.25">Zhang was carrying four cell phones a</text>
  <text start="1265.989" dur="4.11">laptop and an external hard drive</text>
  <text start="1268.659" dur="3">she told agents she feared there would</text>
  <text start="1270.099" dur="2.16">be stolen if she left them in her hotel</text>
  <text start="1271.659" dur="2.22">room</text>
  <text start="1272.259" dur="4.2">however when agents searched her room</text>
  <text start="1273.879" dur="4.14">they discovered in the open more</text>
  <text start="1276.459" dur="4.17">electronics gear including</text>
  <text start="1278.019" dur="4.62">a device to detect hidden cameras eight</text>
  <text start="1280.629" dur="3.6">thousand dollars in cash and numerous</text>
  <text start="1282.639" dur="3.78">credit and debit cards she faced no</text>
  <text start="1284.229" dur="3.87">espionage charges however okay with part</text>
  <text start="1286.419" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re not bringing it up here is that</text>
  <text start="1288.099" dur="5.49">on that thumb drive there was all kinds</text>
  <text start="1291.249" dur="4.02">of like malware what not they didn&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="1293.589" dur="4.38">specifically what it was but it was some</text>
  <text start="1295.269" dur="5.58">sort of malware so we see that she had a</text>
  <text start="1297.969" dur="4.29">device to detect hidden cameras so</text>
  <text start="1300.849" dur="3.32">obviously she seemed like she wanted to</text>
  <text start="1302.259" dur="5.01">do something that needed to be</text>
  <text start="1304.169" dur="4.99">undetected by cameras right and I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1307.269" dur="3.21">help but think that I suppose it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1309.159" dur="2.49">possible that it could have been one way</text>
  <text start="1310.479" dur="3.12">or another she could have been there to</text>
  <text start="1311.649" dur="3.72">get information but I have a feeling</text>
  <text start="1313.599" dur="3.72">that she might have been there to drop</text>
  <text start="1315.369" dur="4.62">something on to something she had always</text>
  <text start="1317.319" dur="4.29">credit cards to and it really makes me</text>
  <text start="1319.989" dur="4.41">wonder if this has something to do with</text>
  <text start="1321.609" dur="4.68">the epstein thing it seems like she was</text>
  <text start="1324.399" dur="4.5">trying to puts maybe some incriminating</text>
  <text start="1326.289" dur="3.75">information onto a computer it&amp;#39;s hard to</text>
  <text start="1328.899" dur="2.73">really know because we don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="1330.039" dur="2.88">kind of malware it was we don&amp;#39;t know a</text>
  <text start="1331.629" dur="2.58">lot of the details but I find it</text>
  <text start="1332.919" dur="3.42">interesting that they forgot to leave</text>
  <text start="1334.209" dur="4.02">that part into the story because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1336.339" dur="3.69">a pretty important part of the story</text>
  <text start="1338.229" dur="3.45">if wanna bitch said Jung lied again</text>
  <text start="1340.029" dur="2.88">saying she never told her she was there</text>
  <text start="1341.679" dur="3.87">to visit the pool she carried no</text>

  <text start="1388.87" dur="4.41">relied on her Mandarin interpreters yeah</text>
  <text start="1391.39" dur="3">that&amp;#39;s pretty sketchy right there at one</text>
