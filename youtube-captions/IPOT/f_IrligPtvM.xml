  <text start="124.28" dur="3.42">start off talking about what everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="125.72" dur="4.379">talking about Jeffrey Epstein I&amp;#39;m over</text>
  <text start="127.7" dur="4.2">here on CBS quote-unquote news Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="130.099" dur="4.951">Epstein has died from apparent suicide</text>
  <text start="131.9" dur="4.53">and his accusers still want justice so</text>
  <text start="135.05" dur="2.61">we&amp;#39;re just gonna cruise through this</text>
  <text start="136.43" dur="4.32">article here most of you are already</text>
  <text start="137.66" dur="5.31">aware of this found around 6:30 a.m. at</text>
  <text start="140.75" dur="4.26">the Metropolitan Correctional Center and</text>
  <text start="142.97" dur="4.5">he was supposed to have been on suicide</text>
  <text start="145.01" dur="4.71">watch looks like they may have taken him</text>
  <text start="147.47" dur="4.31">off we&amp;#39;re not really sure why that would</text>
  <text start="149.72" dur="4.2">be and of course that launched a Twitter</text>
  <text start="151.78" dur="3.91">firestorm if you&amp;#39;ve been on social media</text>
  <text start="153.92" dur="3.81">at all this is about probably all you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="155.69" dur="4.11">heard about right so we don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="157.73" dur="3.81">know what the true story is we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="159.8" dur="4.439">plenty of speculation plenty of</text>
  <text start="161.54" dur="5.04">possibilities and I know a lot of people</text>
  <text start="164.239" dur="4.231">are really upset about this and</text>
  <text start="166.58" dur="3.42">really shows out there in the media AG</text>
  <text start="168.47" dur="3.81">William bar has already launched a</text>
  <text start="170" dur="4.59">separate investigation into this alone</text>
  <text start="172.28" dur="4.17">of course Rudy Giuliani was out speaking</text>
  <text start="174.59" dur="4.44">out everybody&amp;#39;s been speaking out about</text>
  <text start="176.45" dur="4.56">this so very interesting stuff right</text>
  <text start="179.03" dur="5.13">ferry seems to be very convenient for</text>
  <text start="181.01" dur="6.81">Jeffrey Epstein so found around 6:30</text>
  <text start="184.16" dur="7.02">a.m. at the MCC and of course we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="187.82" dur="5.37">some pictures that show him being</text>
  <text start="191.18" dur="3.24">wheeled out let&amp;#39;s check those out and</text>
  <text start="193.19" dur="3.51">here is the picture that everyone is</text>
  <text start="194.42" dur="4.32">checking out right here I think many of</text>
  <text start="196.7" dur="3.75">you are like me you&amp;#39;re not buying this</text>
  <text start="198.74" dur="3.87">first of all this guy&amp;#39;s been dead for</text>
  <text start="200.45" dur="4.62">some hours already why is his face not</text>
  <text start="202.61" dur="4.2">covered the coloring in his face doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="205.07" dur="3.87">look quite right seems like it would be</text>
  <text start="206.81" dur="4.08">a little bit red unless they actually</text>
  <text start="208.94" dur="3.78">caught him hanging and again if he was</text>
  <text start="210.89" dur="3.3">on suicide watch not really sure how</text>
  <text start="212.72" dur="3.72">they would have been able to catch that</text>
  <text start="214.19" dur="4.44">and nobody has even announced that they</text>
  <text start="216.44" dur="2.55">caught him hanging so none of it makes</text>
  <text start="218.63" dur="2.34">sense</text>
  <text start="218.99" dur="4.2">now here&amp;#39;s another picture comparing</text>
  <text start="220.97" dur="4.11">Jeffrey Epstein in this man it looks to</text>
  <text start="223.19" dur="4.23">me obvious that this is not the same</text>
  <text start="225.08" dur="4.71">nose the same ears once again I think</text>
  <text start="227.42" dur="3.75">many of you already agree with me there</text>
  <text start="229.79" dur="3.3">have been some that have been going out</text>
  <text start="231.17" dur="5.25">as far as saying that this is Anthony</text>
  <text start="233.09" dur="6.03">Bourdain to which I say that is going</text>
  <text start="236.42" dur="4.17">probably way too far I don&amp;#39;t see why</text>
  <text start="239.12" dur="3.78">they would risk even if you were using</text>
  <text start="240.59" dur="4.41">this as a photo op comparing this to</text>
  <text start="242.9" dur="4.29">another high-profile dead person death</text>
  <text start="245" dur="3.6">just seems like a great way to ask for</text>
  <text start="247.19" dur="3.78">more trouble so I don&amp;#39;t know who this</text>
  <text start="248.6" dur="5.31">guy is but it does not look like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="250.97" dur="5.37">Jeffrey Epstein to me so who is our guy</text>
  <text start="253.91" dur="5.16">on gertie couldn&amp;#39;t really tell you maybe</text>
  <text start="256.34" dur="4.95">this is our new grassy knoll figure guy</text>
  <text start="259.07" dur="4.26">on gurney but it does not strike me as</text>
  <text start="261.29" dur="4.2">Epstein we all could be wrong I suppose</text>
  <text start="263.33" dur="3.75">but I think we&amp;#39;re all smelling something</text>
  <text start="265.49" dur="3.24">suspect now there&amp;#39;s a few different</text>
  <text start="267.08" dur="4.56">lines of thinking in regards to this</text>
  <text start="268.73" dur="4.8">story there is of course the the way of</text>
  <text start="271.64" dur="4.11">thinking that maybe the deep state broke</text>
  <text start="273.53" dur="5.01">in switch this guy out somehow</text>
  <text start="275.75" dur="5">and who knows wisdom off to some magical</text>
  <text start="278.54" dur="4.92">land where he&amp;#39;s now got himself some</text>
  <text start="280.75" dur="5.5">reconstructive facial surgery and is</text>
  <text start="283.46" dur="5.49">living somewhere in Israel who really</text>
  <text start="286.25" dur="5.07">knows then I suppose you could also</text>
  <text start="288.95" dur="5.13">argue that it was the good guys that</text>
  <text start="291.32" dur="4.59">busted this dude out and put him into</text>
  <text start="294.08" dur="4.86">some sort of protective custody</text>
  <text start="295.91" dur="4.15">witness protection could very well be</text>
  <text start="298.94" dur="2.41">either one could be</text>
  <text start="300.06" dur="3.3">possible and then of course it also</text>
  <text start="301.35" dur="5.55">could be possible that the official</text>
  <text start="303.36" dur="5.88">story is that he is dead now in regards</text>
  <text start="306.9" dur="4.89">to busting him out and taking him</text>
  <text start="309.24" dur="5.37">somewhere else this seems to make a lot</text>
  <text start="311.79" dur="4.68">of sense for a lot of reasons and really</text>
  <text start="314.61" dur="4.38">I think we need to look no further than</text>
  <text start="316.47" dur="4.77">social media all we have to really do is</text>
  <text start="318.99" dur="4.05">kind of look at and see who&amp;#39;s clamoring</text>
  <text start="321.24" dur="4.86">and what they&amp;#39;re clamouring about we</text>
  <text start="323.04" dur="5.01">have a lot of the liberal media that was</text>
  <text start="326.1" dur="4.77">kind of crying about this equally as</text>
  <text start="328.05" dur="3.93">much as conservative media but they</text>
  <text start="330.87" dur="3.75">weren&amp;#39;t really demanding an</text>
  <text start="331.98" dur="5.01">investigation they&amp;#39;re wanting to kind of</text>
  <text start="334.62" dur="5.1">move on from this narrative now I</text>
  <text start="336.99" dur="5.22">suppose if you already establish in the</text>
  <text start="339.72" dur="4.44">outward narrative that he&amp;#39;s dead I</text>
  <text start="342.21" dur="3.959">suppose you couldn&amp;#39;t kill him again</text>
  <text start="344.16" dur="3.99">right after all there&amp;#39;s a lot of people</text>
  <text start="346.169" dur="3.541">that would love to see this guy killed</text>
  <text start="348.15" dur="3.72">and of course if they were actually able</text>
  <text start="349.71" dur="3.69">to achieve that and then that got out</text>
  <text start="351.87" dur="3.18">that would be a big deal because</text>
  <text start="353.4" dur="3.12">everyone would be saying wait a minute I</text>
  <text start="355.05" dur="3.27">thought he was already dead</text>
  <text start="356.52" dur="5.13">so we&amp;#39;re in a bit of a conundrum here</text>
  <text start="358.32" dur="5.25">aren&amp;#39;t we now whether or not he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="361.65" dur="3.93">flown off to something like Gitmo or not</text>
  <text start="363.57" dur="3.75">I&amp;#39;m not really sure but I&amp;#39;d like you to</text>
  <text start="365.58" dur="4.2">check this out now I want to say thanks</text>
  <text start="367.32" dur="3.9">to military spec ops monkey who sent me</text>
  <text start="369.78" dur="2.61">this screenshot and I want to give you a</text>
  <text start="371.22" dur="3.18">little bit of context here because</text>
  <text start="372.39" dur="4.11">there&amp;#39;s no date on this screenshot but</text>
  <text start="374.4" dur="4.56">according to him this was from last week</text>
  <text start="376.5" dur="4.65">so this is likely before Jeffrey Epstein</text>
  <text start="378.96" dur="4.8">was found but it wouldn&amp;#39;t have probably</text>
  <text start="381.15" dur="4.98">been that long before that but it was</text>
  <text start="383.76" dur="4.38">from last week but as you can see we had</text>
  <text start="386.13" dur="6.03">this plane from Kalitta charters to</text>
  <text start="388.14" dur="6.749">Boeing 737-300 twin jet airplane this is</text>
  <text start="392.16" dur="5.31">going from Guantanamo Bay to Miami</text>
  <text start="394.889" dur="4.681">International now the only curious</text>
  <text start="397.47" dur="4.68">things that I found here were that this</text>
  <text start="399.57" dur="4.469">seems to be about about a roughly 170</text>
  <text start="402.15" dur="4.139">something miles out of out of the way of</text>
  <text start="404.039" dur="5.25">this normal trip so it looks like they</text>
  <text start="406.289" dur="5.911">made a little bit of an extra trip now</text>
  <text start="409.289" dur="5.041">this Kalitta charters is a is a group</text>
  <text start="412.2" dur="4.95">that works for the DOJ Department of</text>
  <text start="414.33" dur="5.1">Defense and really all branches of the</text>
  <text start="417.15" dur="3.96">military this was started by Connie</text>
  <text start="419.43" dur="4.14">Kalitta who was actually I believe she</text>
  <text start="421.11" dur="4.05">was a drag race driver for decades</text>
  <text start="423.57" dur="3.06">Kalitta Flying Service the original</text>
  <text start="425.16" dur="3.66">Kalitta company was an approved air</text>
  <text start="426.63" dur="3.87">carrier of the US Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="428.82" dur="3.75">when the Kalitta group diversified</text>
  <text start="430.5" dur="2.669">Kalitta charters Kalitta charters too</text>
  <text start="432.57" dur="2.64">and</text>
  <text start="433.169" dur="4.8">err all maintained their proof status</text>
  <text start="435.21" dur="4.829">with the DOJ now this is what&amp;#39;s curious</text>
  <text start="437.969" dur="4.651">the Kalitta companies currently utilize</text>
  <text start="440.039" dur="7.65">all our aircraft types for the DOJ Lear</text>
  <text start="442.62" dur="7.44">Jets Falcons dc9 SB 727s and B 747s</text>
  <text start="447.689" dur="5.371">configurations include passenger all</text>
  <text start="450.06" dur="5.52">cargo air ambulance and aircraft that</text>
  <text start="453.06" dur="4.77">are specifically retrofitted for unique</text>
  <text start="455.58" dur="4.23">mission requirements additionally</text>
  <text start="457.83" dur="4.109">Kalitta maintains dedicated backup</text>
  <text start="459.81" dur="4.469">aircraft as required to ensure mission</text>
  <text start="461.939" dur="5.311">integrity okay so we don&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="464.279" dur="6">know whether Epstein or anybody else was</text>
  <text start="467.25" dur="4.439">on these planes that were in you know in</text>
  <text start="470.279" dur="3.151">reference to the story that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="471.689" dur="3.181">talking about but I did find this fight</text>
  <text start="473.43" dur="3.87">flight to be a little bit curious as</text>
  <text start="474.87" dur="10.979">this actual callsign doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be</text>
  <text start="477.3" dur="11.459">in their current roster taking you back</text>
  <text start="485.849" dur="5.731">to March of 2018 if you all remember</text>
  <text start="488.759" dur="5.46">President Trump was signing the omnibus</text>
  <text start="491.58" dur="5.19">bill back then and I talked a lot about</text>
  <text start="494.219" dur="5.7">this in my video is probably from March</text>
  <text start="496.77" dur="4.949">24th through 26 I broke down the omnibus</text>
  <text start="499.919" dur="4.231">and we talked a lot about where some of</text>
  <text start="501.719" dur="3.781">this money was going and the reason why</text>
  <text start="504.15" dur="4.859">I bring you here this is a massive</text>
  <text start="505.5" dur="6.11">document 2232 pages but ain&amp;#39;t nobody got</text>
  <text start="509.009" dur="5.101">time for that we&amp;#39;re taking you to 159</text>
  <text start="511.61" dur="5.71">we&amp;#39;re talking about some fees expenses</text>
  <text start="514.11" dur="5.19">of witnesses for fees and expenses of</text>
  <text start="517.32" dur="3.81">witnesses for expenses of contracts for</text>
  <text start="519.3" dur="4.2">the procurement and supervision of</text>

  <text start="526.5" dur="5.19">expenses of foreign counsel 270 million</text>

  <text start="536.85" dur="6.03">for protected witness safe sites not to</text>
  <text start="540.75" dur="4.05">exceed 3 million dollars is for the</text>

  <text start="563.459" dur="3.181">under this heading may not be</text>
  <text start="564.87" dur="4.23">transferred pursuant to section 2</text>
  <text start="566.64" dur="4.5">five of this act okay so we knew about</text>
  <text start="569.1" dur="3.9">this back then now my original thought</text>
  <text start="571.14" dur="4.17">would be that if somebody like Epstein</text>
  <text start="573" dur="4.59">would not be in Guantanamo Bay because</text>
  <text start="575.31" dur="4.29">he&amp;#39;s a civilian and this would be</text>
  <text start="577.59" dur="3.54">normally for people who are guilty of</text>
  <text start="579.6" dur="4.05">you know different kinds of crimes</text>
  <text start="581.13" dur="5.16">military crimes and whatnot now given</text>
  <text start="583.65" dur="4.98">all of his different connections there</text>
  <text start="586.29" dur="4.83">may be a reason to keep him there but we</text>
  <text start="588.63" dur="4.38">do know that the money over there is for</text>
  <text start="591.12" dur="3.99">these witness safe sighs we talked about</text>
  <text start="593.01" dur="3.51">it and I broke this down actually in</text>
  <text start="595.11" dur="3.36">great detail back then it looked like</text>
  <text start="596.52" dur="3.57">they were building bunkers this was</text>
  <text start="598.47" dur="3.6">supposed to be real deal for people who</text>
  <text start="600.09" dur="4.14">were really trying to bust these people</text>
  <text start="602.07" dur="3.9">out and the only kind of person that I</text>
  <text start="604.23" dur="4.17">could think of at this point in the game</text>
  <text start="605.97" dur="4.17">that would belong there would be</text>
  <text start="608.4" dur="3.69">somebody like Jeffrey Epstein so you</text>
  <text start="610.14" dur="3.6">could tell me what you think but I just</text>
  <text start="612.09" dur="3.24">want to point out that back then we knew</text>
  <text start="613.74" dur="3.45">there was money for the construction of</text>
  <text start="615.33" dur="3.21">this now of course this is a military</text>
  <text start="617.19" dur="3.23">base and everything&amp;#39;s gonna be pretty</text>
  <text start="618.54" dur="3.69">safe but they were obviously</text>
  <text start="620.42" dur="3.01">anticipating back then that they were</text>
  <text start="622.23" dur="3.87">going to have some high-profile</text>
  <text start="623.43" dur="5.34">witnesses that were likely going to have</text>
  <text start="626.1" dur="4.77">attempts to break him out and or break</text>
  <text start="628.77" dur="4.11">people out so this to me would make a</text>
  <text start="630.87" dur="4.23">lot of sense it&amp;#39;s what sort of jogged my</text>
  <text start="632.88" dur="3.36">memory about this whole thing you guys</text>
  <text start="635.1" dur="2.88">can let me know what you think down</text>
  <text start="636.24" dur="3.63">below now I couldn&amp;#39;t imagine POTUS</text>
  <text start="637.98" dur="3.84">directly weighing in but we have some</text>
  <text start="639.87" dur="4.14">really interesting tweets starting from</text>
  <text start="641.82" dur="4.47">back August 10th here he goes after</text>
  <text start="644.01" dur="3.72">Maggie Haberman of the failing New York</text>
  <text start="646.29" dur="3.33">Times reported that I was annoyed by the</text>
  <text start="647.73" dur="4.11">lack of cameras inside the hospitals in</text>
  <text start="649.62" dur="3.81">Dayton and El Paso and of course those</text>
  <text start="651.84" dur="4.23">were the two shootings that we had last</text>
  <text start="653.43" dur="4.56">week that oddly enough was pulling all</text>
  <text start="656.07" dur="4.77">the headlines away from the Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="657.99" dur="4.83">Epstein case so he goes on to talk about</text>
  <text start="660.84" dur="5.55">Kim Jong moon they had fired off some</text>
  <text start="662.82" dur="5.16">little rockets just the other day and he</text>
  <text start="666.39" dur="3.36">was saying it wasn&amp;#39;t really any big deal</text>
  <text start="667.98" dur="4.71">but then he just started going after all</text>
  <text start="669.75" dur="5.4">kinds of people goes after Bill Maher</text>
  <text start="672.69" dur="4.71">got to see by accident wacko comedian</text>
  <text start="675.15" dur="3.87">Bill Maher shows so many lies in and</text>
  <text start="677.4" dur="2.55">then again it&amp;#39;s talking about El Paso</text>
  <text start="679.02" dur="4.2">and whatnot but I found it very</text>
  <text start="679.95" dur="5.94">interesting that he targeted Bill Maher</text>
  <text start="683.22" dur="5.25">who&amp;#39;s essentially always clowning but</text>
  <text start="685.89" dur="4.92">then went on to go on and tweet this</text>
  <text start="688.47" dur="4.08">right here from BNL news documents were</text>
  <text start="690.81" dur="3.66">unsealed yesterday revealing that top</text>
  <text start="692.55" dur="3.84">Democrats including Bill Clinton took</text>
  <text start="694.47" dur="3.35">private trips to Jeffrey Epstein&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="696.39" dur="3.05">pedophilia island</text>
  <text start="697.82" dur="3.78">and that is really where the narrative</text>
  <text start="699.44" dur="5.97">needs to be right paying attention to</text>
  <text start="701.6" dur="5.52">this 26 trips on that plane and of</text>
  <text start="705.41" dur="5.49">course this is going to involve Prince</text>
  <text start="707.12" dur="5.31">Andrew now Ghislaine Maxwell and this is</text>
  <text start="710.9" dur="2.79">really gonna start opening some things</text>
  <text start="712.43" dur="3.96">up now something I&amp;#39;d like you to</text>
  <text start="713.69" dur="4.5">consider very much like the nexium thing</text>
  <text start="716.39" dur="3.45">we had aliceandmac who was really the</text>
  <text start="718.19" dur="3.69">key figure she was the one that was</text>
  <text start="719.84" dur="3.6">kicking out all the names even though</text>
  <text start="721.88" dur="3.69">Keith Renier was essentially this</text>
  <text start="723.44" dur="3.6">figurehead right perhaps this was a very</text>
  <text start="725.57" dur="4.38">similar situation with Jeffrey Epstein</text>
  <text start="727.04" dur="4.47">and Rachel Chandler who although the</text>
  <text start="729.95" dur="3.84">mainstream media is not talking about</text>
  <text start="731.51" dur="4.59">they are talking about Virginia jofre</text>
  <text start="733.79" dur="4.5">who is essentially the plaintiff in this</text>
  <text start="736.1" dur="4.41">so this will be very very interesting</text>
  <text start="738.29" dur="4.5">but if we start getting to see Rachel</text>
  <text start="740.51" dur="3.96">Chandler involved in this and I think</text>
  <text start="742.79" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;re really gonna see this bust wide</text>
  <text start="744.47" dur="3.87">open as this case has not been closed</text>
  <text start="746.57" dur="3.33">but it was interesting that POTUS</text>
  <text start="748.34" dur="4.14">retweeted this now I&amp;#39;m gonna back you up</text>
  <text start="749.9" dur="5.01">here so you can see the whole thing then</text>
  <text start="752.48" dur="4.35">POTUS retweeted this this was on August</text>
  <text start="754.91" dur="3.74">11th from Terrance Kate Williams he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="756.83" dur="4.83">real funny pundit over here on Twitter</text>
  <text start="758.65" dur="4.9">died of suicide on 24/7 suicide watch</text>
  <text start="761.66" dur="3.9">yeah right how does that happen</text>
  <text start="763.55" dur="4.05">Jeffrey Epstein had information on Bill</text>
  <text start="765.56" dur="4.35">Clinton and now he&amp;#39;s dead I see Trump</text>
  <text start="767.6" dur="4.62">body count trending but we know who did</text>
  <text start="769.91" dur="3.63">this so this was interesting that POTUS</text>
  <text start="772.22" dur="3.51">would retweet this although he hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="773.54" dur="4.41">really directly said much about this and</text>
  <text start="775.73" dur="3.66">of course this said all the media i&amp;#39;ts</text>
  <text start="777.95" dur="3.12">into a frenzy</text>
  <text start="779.39" dur="3.15">everyone is attacking him on Twitter</text>
  <text start="781.07" dur="3.81">saying that he is kicking around</text>
  <text start="782.54" dur="4.89">conspiracy theories so this is very very</text>
  <text start="784.88" dur="5.58">interesting with HM being down Q not</text>
  <text start="787.43" dur="4.56">posting this all coming out it seems to</text>
  <text start="790.46" dur="4.47">come to a head that eventually we are</text>
  <text start="791.99" dur="5.01">going to have to ask the question so he</text>
  <text start="794.93" dur="3.9">goes on to talk about Joe Biden e</text>
  <text start="797" dur="4.05">Anthony scary Moochie Donny Deutsch she</text>
  <text start="798.83" dur="3.9">would start on the apprentice his TV</text>
  <text start="801.05" dur="3.99">show from back in the day really went</text>
  <text start="802.73" dur="4.74">after all these knuckleheads but of</text>
  <text start="805.04" dur="4.02">course hasn&amp;#39;t come out and said directly</text>
  <text start="807.47" dur="4.59">what he thinks but I think the retweet</text>
  <text start="809.06" dur="5.52">says it all so is Epstein alive or dead</text>
  <text start="812.06" dur="5.19">your guess is as good as mine Patriots</text>
  <text start="814.58" dur="5.64">but I would imagine this if he is indeed</text>
  <text start="817.25" dur="5.73">dead I would assume that his usefulness</text>
  <text start="820.22" dur="5.82">has likely run its course and that very</text>
  <text start="822.98" dur="4.89">well maybe the case now is he off under</text>
  <text start="826.04" dur="3.75">an assumed name somewhere else - I</text>
  <text start="827.87" dur="4.469">couldn&amp;#39;t ignore the fact that that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="829.79" dur="6.06">possibility I&amp;#39;m not so sure but keep in</text>
  <text start="832.339" dur="6.031">mind you know this guy if we know what</text>
  <text start="835.85" dur="4.56">an important witness this person is you</text>
  <text start="838.37" dur="4.11">can guarantee that AG William bar</text>
  <text start="840.41" dur="4.07">president Trump these people all know</text>
  <text start="842.48" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re not exactly going to put this</text>
  <text start="844.48" dur="5.95">sort of half effort into protecting this</text>
  <text start="847.91" dur="5.039">guy and I&amp;#39;m not so sure that I&amp;#39;m buying</text>
  <text start="850.43" dur="4.409">the official story from the MCC saying</text>
  <text start="852.949" dur="2.341">that they were rotating guards every 30</text>
  <text start="854.839" dur="2.821">minutes</text>
  <text start="855.29" dur="4.109">and then everybody was overworked and</text>
  <text start="857.66" dur="3.75">whatnot this looks like a whole bunch of</text>
  <text start="859.399" dur="3.99">cover stories right here but I think</text>
  <text start="861.41" dur="5.07">what&amp;#39;s really important about all of</text>
  <text start="863.389" dur="5.13">this is that alive or dead the story is</text>
  <text start="866.48" dur="3">back on the attention where it needs to</text>
  <text start="868.519" dur="3.031">be</text>
  <text start="869.48" dur="4.56">once again Clinton body-bags was</text>
  <text start="871.55" dur="4.8">trending on Twitter people are focusing</text>
  <text start="874.04" dur="3.989">their attention on people that we know</text>
  <text start="876.35" dur="3.45">were connected to Epstein and of course</text>
  <text start="878.029" dur="3.541">lots of Trump haters are trying to</text>
  <text start="879.8" dur="5.13">connect him - but I think that wall</text>
  <text start="881.57" dur="5.16">shake out in the wash but definitely the</text>
  <text start="884.93" dur="4.709">attention is back on the Clintons once</text>
  <text start="886.73" dur="5.58">again who have not exactly weighed in on</text>
  <text start="889.639" dur="4.68">all this for obvious reasons but that</text>
  <text start="892.31" dur="5.31">kind of leads me to this next story here</text>
  <text start="894.319" dur="4.981">now if you will remember that last week</text>
  <text start="897.62" dur="3.48">the New York Times was under some</text>
  <text start="899.3" dur="4.71">scrutiny for having changed one of their</text>
  <text start="901.1" dur="5.76">headlines they kind of caved to some</text>
  <text start="904.01" dur="4.769">pressure and that was actually fantastic</text>
  <text start="906.86" dur="3.51">cuz it was a big big embarrassment for</text>
  <text start="908.779" dur="3.24">the failing New York Times and it looks</text>
  <text start="910.37" dur="3.39">like they&amp;#39;ve done it once again this is</text>

  <text start="1263.35" dur="3.15">leaked this but this has been going</text>
  <text start="1264.91" dur="2.94">around the interwebs for the last few</text>
  <text start="1266.5" dur="3.75">days and I thought that you would get a</text>
  <text start="1267.85" dur="5.55">kick out of this David Brock of course</text>
  <text start="1270.25" dur="4.98">he&amp;#39;s a stalwart over there share blue</text>
  <text start="1273.4" dur="4.05">and he wants to make sure that fake news</text>
  <text start="1275.23" dur="3.48">is handling this properly</text>
  <text start="1277.45" dur="3.21">all right Patriots that&amp;#39;s all I got for</text>
  <text start="1278.71" dur="4.77">you for now one last final note I want</text>
  <text start="1280.66" dur="4.86">to remind you that Jim Watkins who&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1283.48" dur="5.01">founder of HN he just came out with a</text>
  <text start="1285.52" dur="5.04">quick little video stating that he was</text>
  <text start="1288.49" dur="4.29">going to be coming in and giving</text>
  <text start="1290.56" dur="4.5">testimony to the Committee on Homeland</text>
  <text start="1292.78" dur="4.56">Security if you remember we talked about</text>
  <text start="1295.06" dur="4.56">it last week they were asking for him to</text>
  <text start="1297.34" dur="3.66">come in and give some testimony he lives</text>
  <text start="1299.62" dur="3.48">out there in the Philippines and it</text>
  <text start="1301" dur="3.9">looks like they&amp;#39;re trying to tie him to</text>
  <text start="1303.1" dur="5.42">not only his involvement obviously with</text>
  <text start="1304.9" dur="7.23">a chant but to their involvement in</text>
  <text start="1308.52" dur="6.22">child pornography and whatnot so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1312.13" dur="4.23">know if this guy really has anything to</text>
  <text start="1314.74" dur="3.27">do with child pornography but it looks</text>
  <text start="1316.36" dur="3.99">like they are most certainly trying to</text>
  <text start="1318.01" dur="4.47">pin that on them which seems ultra</text>
  <text start="1320.35" dur="5.31">convenient but what he says in this</text>
  <text start="1322.48" dur="5.64">video is that HN should be going back up</text>
  <text start="1325.66" dur="4.17">but he wants to go ahead and give this</text>
  <text start="1328.12" dur="4.17">testimony first so as soon as we get a</text>
  <text start="1329.83" dur="4.65">date and all that time on all that we</text>
  <text start="1332.29" dur="3.21">will get that covered and see what&amp;#39;s up</text>
  <text start="1334.48" dur="4.26">but I think that&amp;#39;s gonna be really</text>
  <text start="1335.5" dur="4.83">really key particularly into whether or</text>
  <text start="1338.74" dur="3.66">not they&amp;#39;re going to introduce cueing on</text>
  <text start="1340.33" dur="4.47">into the public narrative or not I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1342.4" dur="4.53">so sure if it&amp;#39;s going to happen in this</text>
  <text start="1344.8" dur="4.32">testimony but it wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise me if</text>
  <text start="1346.93" dur="4.42">he is asked about it and that eventually</text>
  <text start="1349.12" dur="3.49">ends up leading to questions for the</text>
  <text start="1351.35" dur="3.06">but you can let me know what you think</text>
