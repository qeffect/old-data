  <text start="69.2" dur="6.51">out to the hour of 8 surveillance of</text>
  <text start="71.9" dur="7.89">Sarah Carter and John Solomon terminated</text>
  <text start="75.71" dur="6.09">sleep well Hugh well it looks like our</text>
  <text start="79.79" dur="3.78">team over there and I guess they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="81.8" dur="3.45">really Fox John Solomon&amp;#39;s from the hill</text>
  <text start="83.57" dur="4.2">Sarah Carter is kind of independent but</text>
  <text start="85.25" dur="4.44">we always see them on Fox we know that</text>
  <text start="87.77" dur="4.709">they have been basically the front line</text>
  <text start="89.69" dur="5.07">for the information war obviously a lot</text>
  <text start="92.479" dur="3.331">of us are digging things up but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="94.76" dur="2.79">the ones that really bring it to</text>
  <text start="95.81" dur="3.99">mainstream they usually announce it on</text>
  <text start="97.55" dur="3.75">Hannity somewhere that&amp;#39;s usually where</text>
  <text start="99.8" dur="4.29">all the breaking stuff kind of comes</text>
  <text start="101.3" dur="4.59">from and a while back you had let us</text>
  <text start="104.09" dur="4.77">know that really essentially they were</text>
  <text start="105.89" dur="5.49">under some protection and looks like</text>
  <text start="108.86" dur="5.73">during that state they were being</text>
  <text start="111.38" dur="4.38">surveilled like we think we&amp;#39;ll find out</text>
  <text start="114.59" dur="2.25">in a little bit really but it is</text>
  <text start="115.76" dur="3.51">essentially through a whistleblower</text>
  <text start="116.84" dur="3.96">program and those are usually the people</text>
  <text start="119.27" dur="4.11">that are getting to Sarah Carter and</text>
  <text start="120.8" dur="4.41">John psalm and so as they break the big</text>
  <text start="123.38" dur="4.17">stories they&amp;#39;re the ones that have had</text>
  <text start="125.21" dur="3.749">to be kind of under that protection and</text>
  <text start="127.55" dur="3.75">it looks like in the process of</text>
  <text start="128.959" dur="4.681">exchanging information there were people</text>
  <text start="131.3" dur="4.89">doing some survey lease stuff</text>
  <text start="133.64" dur="5.129">well that&amp;#39;s know more and Q says you can</text>
  <text start="136.19" dur="3.81">sleep well let&amp;#39;s move on to the next</text>
  <text start="138.769" dur="4.411">post we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about that some</text>
  <text start="140" dur="5.519">more here 33 74 19 minutes after the</text>
  <text start="143.18" dur="4.86">hour of 8 responding to an and on who</text>
  <text start="145.519" dur="5.431">says Hannity just dropped the pen again</text>
  <text start="148.04" dur="4.89">using a very artificial tone follow the</text>
  <text start="150.95" dur="4.2">pen quote Hannity was talking directly</text>
  <text start="152.93" dur="5.73">to us and of course we know that that is</text>
  <text start="155.15" dur="5.64">usually in reference to upcoming yo s Q</text>
  <text start="158.66" dur="4.23">will mention that follow the pen I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="160.79" dur="4.8">actually watching Sean Hannity right now</text>
  <text start="162.89" dur="4.439">I&amp;#39;m about a few minutes in but I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="165.59" dur="3.899">really gotten to check up on it my whole</text>
  <text start="167.329" dur="3.511">computer shut down today so I&amp;#39;ve had a</text>
  <text start="169.489" dur="3.541">whole bunch of problems so I&amp;#39;m catching</text>
  <text start="170.84" dur="4.5">up on Sean Hannity but it looks like</text>
  <text start="173.03" dur="3.57">this anon is saying follow the pen was</text>
  <text start="175.34" dur="2.97">something that Hannity dropped and</text>
  <text start="176.6" dur="4.08">Hannity has dropped a lot of cute clues</text>
  <text start="178.31" dur="4.89">and Q is kind of confirming this here</text>
  <text start="180.68" dur="5.7">saying haven&amp;#39;t you figured it out by and</text>
  <text start="183.2" dur="5.25">now well if you have it I would just say</text>
  <text start="186.38" dur="3.78">this Hannity knows what&amp;#39;s up Sarah</text>
  <text start="188.45" dur="3.87">Carter knows what&amp;#39;s up John Solomon</text>
  <text start="190.16" dur="3.99">knows what&amp;#39;s up and that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="192.32" dur="2.97">to kind of stay with them because</text>
  <text start="194.15" dur="2.61">they&amp;#39;re the ones that have really been</text>
  <text start="195.29" dur="4.44">breaking it and it&amp;#39;s really been those</text>
  <text start="196.76" dur="5.58">three obviously dougie Collins has been</text>
  <text start="199.73" dur="4.68">dropping a lot of the different</text>
  <text start="202.34" dur="3.6">documents and things online sharing</text>
  <text start="204.41" dur="3.859">things on Twitter but it&amp;#39;s really been</text>
  <text start="205.94" dur="4.32">these guys busting everything out</text>
  <text start="208.269" dur="3.611">particularly John Solomon&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="210.26" dur="4.11">uncovering a lot of really great stuff</text>
  <text start="211.88" dur="4.71">but Hannity has been dropping a ton of</text>
  <text start="214.37" dur="3.57">clues talking about the storm and it</text>
  <text start="216.59" dur="4.41">looks like we&amp;#39;re talking about the pan</text>
  <text start="217.94" dur="6.96">so I would imagine an eeo must be coming</text>

  <text start="236.019" dur="4.331">program so there you go you know</text>
  <text start="239" dur="2.94">obviously there are all these different</text>
  <text start="240.35" dur="3.72">concept programs we had a similar thing</text>
  <text start="241.94" dur="4.74">back in the day with Edward Snowden to</text>
  <text start="244.07" dur="5.669">where there are these sort of programs</text>

  <text start="249.739" dur="4.321">your information right well it looks</text>
  <text start="251.81" dur="3.81">like that is how they were surveilling</text>
  <text start="254.06" dur="4.109">that and of course the NSA I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="255.62" dur="5.64">caught onto that very very quickly but</text>
  <text start="258.169" dur="5.101">that is no mo now we started getting</text>

  <text start="308.81" dur="4.889">name for some sort of video or at least</text>
  <text start="311.839" dur="4.92">part of it and it might have been</text>
  <text start="313.699" dur="4.89">this was back like I said March 2018 you</text>
  <text start="316.759" dur="3.84">might have been calling this out just to</text>
  <text start="318.589" dur="4.651">kind of let people know the bad actors</text>
  <text start="320.599" dur="4.53">if you will that we have it all reread</text>

  <text start="325.129" dur="4.35">setting the stage for HRC and we were</text>
  <text start="327.469" dur="3.181">wondering back last year if that would</text>
  <text start="329.479" dur="4.05">be the time and it turns out of course</text>
  <text start="330.65" dur="4.349">that it wasn&amp;#39;t hopefully it might be</text>
  <text start="333.529" dur="4.5">different this year we shall see the</text>
  <text start="334.999" dur="6.63">nail in many coffins liberal on that do</text>
  <text start="338.029" dur="5.7">so when Q says liberal undo I have a</text>
  <text start="341.629" dur="5.04">feeling that this has something to do</text>
  <text start="343.729" dur="5.641">with a really really hardcore liberal a</text>
  <text start="346.669" dur="4.8">sort of social talking point if you will</text>
  <text start="349.37" dur="3.659">whether it&amp;#39;s you know the board reissue</text>
  <text start="351.469" dur="3.48">winner but I really think it has to do</text>
  <text start="353.029" dur="3.331">something with Planned Parenthood sadly</text>
  <text start="354.949" dur="3.601">I think it has something to do with</text>
  <text start="356.36" dur="4.38">children and I think many of you do too</text>
  <text start="358.55" dur="4.739">that&amp;#39;s why Q says it&amp;#39;s impossible to</text>
  <text start="360.74" dur="3.87">defend toxic to those connected yeah I</text>
  <text start="363.289" dur="4.141">suppose if there&amp;#39;s video is something</text>
  <text start="364.61" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s really really toxic then there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="367.43" dur="3.63">just no going back from that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="368.87" dur="4.469">matter what your politics are and I</text>
  <text start="371.06" dur="4.68">suppose if it has to do with something</text>
  <text start="373.339" dur="4.14">like that or something you know like I</text>
  <text start="375.74" dur="3.239">don&amp;#39;t even want to mention it but you</text>
  <text start="377.479" dur="3.21">can imagine with Planned Parenthood what</text>
  <text start="378.979" dur="4.381">it could do with right that would be</text>
  <text start="380.689" dur="4.681">extremely damning to that whole talking</text>

  <text start="868.9" dur="4.26">the Obama administration through his</text>
  <text start="870.49" dur="4.56">older brother okay so this is long going</text>
  <text start="873.16" dur="4.38">on like this and like Q was saying this</text>
  <text start="875.05" dur="5.04">is a good example and I think what</text>
  <text start="877.54" dur="4.02">Romney says here is a perfect Romney has</text>
  <text start="880.09" dur="3.96">already proven himself willing to go</text>
  <text start="881.56" dur="4.38">after Obama for crony capitalism as he</text>
  <text start="884.05" dur="3.9">did during the first debate the place</text>
  <text start="885.94" dur="4.26">you put your money makes a pretty clear</text>
  <text start="887.95" dur="4.98">indication of where your heart is indeed</text>
  <text start="890.2" dur="4.68">it does Romney said ninety billion</text>
  <text start="892.93" dur="3.9">dollars but the kicker was really this</text>
  <text start="894.88" dur="3.6">and I think this is a true with a lot of</text>
  <text start="896.83" dur="3.21">these green companies and these</text>
  <text start="898.48" dur="3.51">businesses many of them have gone out of</text>
  <text start="900.04" dur="3.84">business I think about half of them of</text>
  <text start="901.99" dur="3.54">the ones that have been invested in have</text>
  <text start="903.88" dur="2.94">gone out of business a number of them</text>
  <text start="905.53" dur="3.93">happened to be owned by people who were</text>
  <text start="906.82" dur="5.64">contributors to your campaigns so I</text>
  <text start="909.46" dur="5.4">wonder where that money ends up going</text>
  <text start="912.46" dur="4.32">the housing contract in Iraq is expected</text>
  <text start="914.86" dur="4.17">to generate 1.5 billion for James</text>
  <text start="916.78" dur="3.48">Biden&amp;#39;s Hill stone according to Fox so</text>
  <text start="919.03" dur="3.42">the report could pave the way for an</text>
  <text start="920.26" dur="4.38">awkward moment for the president in</text>
  <text start="922.45" dur="3.63">tonight&amp;#39;s debate on foreign policy okay</text>
  <text start="924.64" dur="3.09">well I think we all know where these</text>
  <text start="926.08" dur="3.36">this money goes now right</text>
  <text start="927.73" dur="3.09">it goes into funding all sorts of other</text>
  <text start="929.44" dur="3.69">kinds of things</text>
  <text start="930.82" dur="4.92">now these green companies are very much</text>
  <text start="933.13" dur="4.44">like these these humanitarian groups</text>
  <text start="935.74" dur="3.36">this slush funds do you know essentially</text>
  <text start="937.57" dur="4.02">just putting money into one thing and</text>
  <text start="939.1" dur="4.44">you know even a rich</text>
  <text start="941.59" dur="3.45">I like Epstein still needs money to</text>
  <text start="943.54" dur="3">build those tunnels on those Islands</text>
  <text start="945.04" dur="3">still has to build all that stuff and of</text>
  <text start="946.54" dur="3.09">course that money has to come from</text>
  <text start="948.04" dur="4.08">somewhere right and this is how it all</text>
  <text start="949.63" dur="4.44">gets done and in this case it was all</text>
  <text start="952.12" dur="3.75">through green companies and this happens</text>
  <text start="954.07" dur="3.3">with tech also and then these companies</text>
  <text start="955.87" dur="3.48">go out of business and that money coming</text>
  <text start="957.37" dur="4.35">never gets accounted for anymore anyway</text>
  <text start="959.35" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s an example the other link here is</text>
  <text start="961.72" dur="5.94">to the New York Post the troubling</text>
  <text start="963.82" dur="6.39">reason why Biden is so soft on China why</text>

  <text start="989.26" dur="2.73">learned differently through Huawei&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="991.12" dur="2.85">action right</text>
  <text start="991.99" dur="3.81">perhaps Biden&amp;#39;s in soutien attitude</text>
  <text start="993.97" dur="3.15">towards the Chinese government has to do</text>
  <text start="995.8" dur="3.69">with the fact that his family does not</text>

  <text start="1340.83" dur="4.77">they have evidence of this or he&amp;#39;s used</text>

  <text start="1348.33" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s what I always think when I see it</text>
  <text start="1349.8" dur="5.25">those who take are offered more powerful</text>
  <text start="1352.86" dur="3.75">positions within the party yes</text>

  <text start="1360.059" dur="3.361">that&amp;#39;s where it starts to get even</text>
  <text start="1361.32" dur="5.359">crazier and that&amp;#39;s where a lot of these</text>
  <text start="1363.42" dur="5.34">law firms start to get involved and</text>
  <text start="1366.679" dur="3.991">essentially start controlling them</text>
  <text start="1368.76" dur="4.32">whether it is through some sort of</text>

  <text start="1373.08" dur="3.9">they catch them doing something damning</text>
  <text start="1374.58" dur="4.38">and then you know hold them to that</text>
  <text start="1376.98" dur="3.449">that&amp;#39;s kind of how they buy the loyalty</text>
  <text start="1378.96" dur="3.03">it isn&amp;#39;t usually just with the money</text>
  <text start="1380.429" dur="2.971">because the money you know somebody can</text>
  <text start="1381.99" dur="3.18">usually just go to jail over that for a</text>
  <text start="1383.4" dur="6.45">few years it&amp;#39;s usually something much</text>
  <text start="1385.17" dur="6.68">much worse Q says drain the swamp indeed</text>

  <text start="1423.99" dur="3.81">something else about Tom Styer now there</text>
  <text start="1425.82" dur="4.95">are some communications between Tom</text>
  <text start="1427.8" dur="5.61">Steyer and John Podesta and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1430.77" dur="4.08">mostly talking about emissions and</text>
  <text start="1433.41" dur="3.48">things like that outwardly they were</text>
  <text start="1434.85" dur="3.72">having a little bit of spat but it looks</text>
  <text start="1436.89" dur="4.5">like inwardly and this is according to</text>
  <text start="1438.57" dur="5.67">the WikiLeaks emails here his brother</text>
  <text start="1441.39" dur="5.52">Tom is into the walnut sauce and if you</text>
  <text start="1444.24" dur="5.28">new to this walnut sauce is another one</text>
  <text start="1446.91" dur="6.66">of those paedophile terms and rather</text>
  <text start="1449.52" dur="7.62">disturbing now this is CC - Tom Steyer</text>
  <text start="1453.57" dur="5.609">it&amp;#39;s actually from Jim Steyer - Podesta</text>
  <text start="1457.14" dur="3.57">but obviously Tom Steyer is included in</text>
  <text start="1459.179" dur="4.891">this so this must have been a super</text>
  <text start="1460.71" dur="5.219">important conversation we know you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="1464.07" dur="3.54">true master of cuisine and we have</text>
  <text start="1465.929" dur="3.661">appreciated that for years of course</text>
  <text start="1467.61" dur="4.71">Podesta has a lot of people over for</text>
  <text start="1469.59" dur="5">dinner but walnut sauce for the pasta</text>
  <text start="1472.32" dur="4.719">Mary please tell us</text>
  <text start="1474.59" dur="6.99">straight story was the sauce actually</text>
  <text start="1477.039" dur="6.911">very tasty who says that who even says</text>
  <text start="1481.58" dur="4.829">that you all know that&amp;#39;s creepy anyway</text>
  <text start="1483.95" dur="4.2">that&amp;#39;s the story so I find it very</text>
  <text start="1486.409" dur="4.441">interesting that now everything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1488.15" dur="4.83">going down with nexium and everything</text>
  <text start="1490.85" dur="4.89">going down which is probably about to go</text>
  <text start="1492.98" dur="4.29">down with Epstein and you know it</text>
  <text start="1495.74" dur="3.689">wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise me if this uh ray</text>
  <text start="1497.27" dur="3.36">Chandler was a lot like Allison Mac and</text>
  <text start="1499.429" dur="3.301">the fact that she probably ends up</text>

  <text start="1502.73" dur="3.929">who&amp;#39;s gonna come down but the timing</text>
  <text start="1504.44" dur="5.099">comes out now Tom Styer wants to run for</text>
  <text start="1506.659" dur="4.231">POTUS and we know that Q has alluded to</text>
  <text start="1509.539" dur="2.61">the fact that a lot of people who are</text>
  <text start="1510.89" dur="3.87">going to be challenging for that</text>
  <text start="1512.149" dur="4.831">position are likely guilty of something</text>
  <text start="1514.76" dur="3.69">that way if something comes at them they</text>
  <text start="1516.98" dur="5.13">can basically claim that this was some</text>
  <text start="1518.45" dur="6.15">sort of you know political you know some</text>
  <text start="1522.11" dur="4.65">sort of warfare right and I think we all</text>
  <text start="1524.6" dur="4.02">know what&amp;#39;s up with Tom Styer he made</text>
  <text start="1526.76" dur="4.169">some millions off this common sense</text>
  <text start="1528.62" dur="5.58">media he&amp;#39;s got a lot of Erie connections</text>
  <text start="1530.929" dur="5.311">to especially with Amazon but it appears</text>
  <text start="1534.2" dur="4.29">that him and his brother like to go over</text>
  <text start="1536.24" dur="6.75">to Podesta and they&amp;#39;re real curious</text>
