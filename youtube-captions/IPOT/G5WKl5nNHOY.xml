  <text start="178.46" dur="4.26">was going to need to come back on and</text>
  <text start="180.2" dur="4.92">verify themselves so I think some of the</text>
  <text start="182.72" dur="4.23">next few posts are a little bit of doing</text>
  <text start="185.12" dur="4.38">that and of course more of the similar</text>

  <text start="189.5" dur="5.37">the anons and whatnot but this looks to</text>
  <text start="191.99" dur="4.17">be a read-only board once again I will</text>
  <text start="194.87" dur="2.85">link it down below in the video</text>
  <text start="196.16" dur="3.51">description you will probably need</text>
  <text start="197.72" dur="4.8">another browser like tor or something</text>
  <text start="199.67" dur="5.7">like that to view it but there you go</text>

  <text start="345.94" dur="3.18">collage right here it&amp;#39;s all a bunch of</text>
  <text start="347.319" dur="3.57">fake news complaining about queuing on</text>

  <text start="350.889" dur="2.491">you can kind of see it we won&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="352.21" dur="3.42">through it all because it&amp;#39;s all fake</text>
  <text start="353.38" dur="4.289">news but obviously if this is just a</text>
  <text start="355.63" dur="3.3">LARP and it&amp;#39;s just a conspiracy theory</text>
  <text start="357.669" dur="5.851">then why are they spending so much time</text>
  <text start="358.93" dur="7.95">on it and then we get this right here</text>
  <text start="363.52" dur="7.38">this is a it&amp;#39;s a clip actually from an</text>
  <text start="366.88" dur="7.17">84 document from William Casey who was</text>
  <text start="370.9" dur="6.06">head of the CIA here is the actual link</text>
  <text start="374.05" dur="4.799">right here to the to the document this</text>
  <text start="376.96" dur="3.78">about I want to say eight page document</text>
  <text start="378.849" dur="3.861">here I want to show you a few things</text>
  <text start="380.74" dur="4.62">here but let&amp;#39;s go back to the cue post</text>
  <text start="382.71" dur="5.44">the agency&amp;#39;s posture towards the media</text>
  <text start="385.36" dur="5.82">is basically defensive reactive and</text>
  <text start="388.15" dur="5.25">tongue-tied what we say is no comment</text>
  <text start="391.18" dur="4.62">that disclosure was wrong an outrageous</text>
  <text start="393.4" dur="4.319">next we wring our hands send emissaries</text>
  <text start="395.8" dur="3.81">out to brief key people in the</text>
  <text start="397.719" dur="4.2">administration in Congress and correct</text>
  <text start="399.61" dur="5.369">the record then hunker back awaiting the</text>
  <text start="401.919" dur="5.22">next blow maybe it&amp;#39;s time for an offense</text>
  <text start="404.979" dur="4.351">as well as a defense as an attempt to</text>
  <text start="407.139" dur="3.721">get things in better balance here are</text>
  <text start="409.33" dur="4.139">some personal thoughts as to do&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="410.86" dur="4.649">don&amp;#39;ts on this score and essentially</text>
  <text start="413.469" dur="4.351">that&amp;#39;s what this stock document is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="415.509" dur="3.69">all about how to handle the media of</text>
  <text start="417.82" dur="2.55">course they were having problems with</text>
  <text start="419.199" dur="3">leaks and</text>
  <text start="420.37" dur="4.109">not but this was also sort of the birth</text>
  <text start="422.199" dur="3.72">of I shouldn&amp;#39;t really say that it was</text>
  <text start="424.479" dur="3.481">the birth I think this has been going on</text>
  <text start="425.919" dur="5.101">for even longer than that but of</text>
  <text start="427.96" dur="4.44">plugging in our intelligence into the</text>
  <text start="431.02" dur="3.51">media and how they&amp;#39;ve kind of worked</text>
  <text start="432.4" dur="3.69">alongside each other so it&amp;#39;s a really</text>
  <text start="434.53" dur="3.63">tangled web you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="436.09" dur="3.359">good and bad to this clearly there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="438.16" dur="3.09">lot of fake news out there but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="439.449" dur="3.961">also a lot of reason for fake news out</text>
  <text start="441.25" dur="4.65">there and that&amp;#39;s because so much of it</text>
  <text start="443.41" dur="4.71">was infiltrated by our intelligence</text>
  <text start="445.9" dur="5.37">officials so I just want to take you</text>
  <text start="448.12" dur="6.54">down here here are a few bullet points</text>
  <text start="451.27" dur="5.73">right here don&amp;#39;t believe we should or</text>
  <text start="454.66" dur="4.35">can frontally attack the concepts listed</text>
  <text start="457" dur="4.32">at the start of paragraph four don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="475.09" dur="4.62">the do&amp;#39;s do you think long term expect</text>
  <text start="478.06" dur="3.54">that self-discipline is probably all we</text>
  <text start="479.71" dur="4.62">can hope for from the media in the</text>
  <text start="481.6" dur="4.86">foreseeable future do remember that the</text>

  <text start="555.209" dur="3.841">think that&amp;#39;s kind of the point that Q is</text>
  <text start="557.639" dur="4.38">trying to make here is that the</text>

  <text start="564.66" dur="4.979">it&amp;#39;s grown really really overgrown in</text>
  <text start="567.35" dur="4.87">kind of hard to keep track of at this</text>

  <text start="572.22" dur="3.78">the Air Force intelligence agency I</text>
  <text start="574.079" dur="4.021">could be wrong on some of these AI a</text>
  <text start="576" dur="4.56">American intelligence agency may be or</text>
  <text start="578.1" dur="3.929">air Intelligence Agency and of course we</text>
  <text start="580.56" dur="3.87">have the DIA which is the Defense</text>
  <text start="582.029" dur="4.381">Intelligence Agency then we have the ESC</text>

  <text start="588.509" dur="6.39">we have iTAC which is a lot like our pot</text>
  <text start="591.209" dur="5.61">except they tack I pot no I think it</text>
  <text start="594.899" dur="4.981">might be the Intel and threat analysis</text>
  <text start="596.819" dur="5.46">Center then we have the N oh I see which</text>
  <text start="599.88" dur="4.829">I believe is the Nimitz operational</text>

  <text start="1660.23" dur="5.04">to the social media networks and let</text>
  <text start="1662.75" dur="4.2">Twitter and Facebook regulate it just</text>
  <text start="1665.27" dur="4.26">the way they did with our data and</text>
  <text start="1666.95" dur="4.23">information it went so well with that we</text>
  <text start="1669.53" dur="3.6">think that it&amp;#39;s probably best to just</text>
  <text start="1671.18" dur="3.45">leave it in the hands for them to decide</text>
  <text start="1673.13" dur="2.9">whether or not its political</text>

  <text start="1688.28" dur="5.22">if you have been online for long enough</text>
  <text start="1691.01" dur="4.68">you&amp;#39;ll know that through the decades</text>
  <text start="1693.5" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;ve had tons of conspiracy theories</text>
  <text start="1695.69" dur="3.09">some of them true some of them not so</text>
  <text start="1697.16" dur="3.78">much some of them somewhere in between</text>
  <text start="1698.78" dur="3.57">right but the fact of the matter is is</text>
  <text start="1700.94" dur="3.72">that they&amp;#39;ve never tried to bring it</text>
  <text start="1702.35" dur="4.62">down before but for some reason queuing</text>
  <text start="1704.66" dur="5.64">on which keeps proving itself time and</text>
  <text start="1706.97" dur="6.39">time again to be fairly accurate seems</text>
  <text start="1710.3" dur="4.47">to be the target of their ire well who</text>
  <text start="1713.36" dur="4.08">controls the media well we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1714.77" dur="8.7">only six companies dopey sneezy bashful</text>

  <text start="1735.71" dur="3.87">day it all goes to the top and usually</text>
  <text start="1738.26" dur="3.21">the people that are really controlling</text>
  <text start="1739.58" dur="4.14">these are names we&amp;#39;ve probably not even</text>
  <text start="1741.47" dur="3.84">really heard that much of right but the</text>
  <text start="1743.72" dur="3.42">fact of the matter is is that it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1745.31" dur="3.78">pretty much falling under the umbrella</text>
  <text start="1747.14" dur="4.02">of these six media companies that</text>
  <text start="1749.09" dur="4.86">control all these things get</text>
