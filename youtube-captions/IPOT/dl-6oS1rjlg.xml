  <text start="157.22" dur="3.78">I think the thing that&amp;#39;s gone through my</text>

  <text start="168.469" dur="2.281">for their respond</text>
  <text start="169.46" dur="2.76">okay so what I find interesting about</text>
  <text start="170.75" dur="3.24">this story is that it doesn&amp;#39;t fit the</text>
  <text start="172.22" dur="4.53">mold that were used to first of all this</text>
  <text start="173.99" dur="4.53">is not a white male right and this guy</text>
  <text start="176.75" dur="3.42">doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be hopped up on any kind</text>
  <text start="178.52" dur="3.54">of meds we&amp;#39;re not hearing anything about</text>
  <text start="180.17" dur="3.78">any kind of mental illness or anything</text>
  <text start="182.06" dur="3.93">like this a lot of people claim to have</text>
  <text start="183.95" dur="4.05">known this guy now they were saying that</text>
  <text start="185.99" dur="3.75">he did quit earlier about twelve hours</text>
  <text start="188" dur="2.94">earlier before this all happened that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="189.74" dur="3.36">also very strange</text>
  <text start="190.94" dur="3.69">he must have still have a you know some</text>
  <text start="193.1" dur="3.84">sort of security clearance to get in at</text>
  <text start="194.63" dur="4.65">least in the office but this really</text>
  <text start="196.94" dur="3.93">brings up you know the issue of course</text>
  <text start="199.28" dur="2.91">of guns in the workplace and things like</text>
  <text start="200.87" dur="4.89">that which I really think this is what</text>
  <text start="202.19" dur="4.86">this is truly about but I noticed that</text>
  <text start="205.76" dur="2.7">they&amp;#39;re not really wanting to give too</text>
  <text start="207.05" dur="3.15">much attention to the shooter himself</text>
  <text start="208.46" dur="3.36">fair enough you don&amp;#39;t want to make</text>
  <text start="210.2" dur="3.96">people famous or whatnot but like I said</text>
  <text start="211.82" dur="4.71">this is not your typical white male this</text>
  <text start="214.16" dur="4.05">was a black man and this was not</text>
  <text start="216.53" dur="3.12">somebody that looked to have any kind of</text>
  <text start="218.21" dur="2.73">history of any sort of mental illness</text>
  <text start="219.65" dur="2.07">this is a person who served in the</text>
  <text start="220.94" dur="2.55">National Guard</text>
  <text start="221.72" dur="3.84">and seemed to have a pretty good job</text>
  <text start="223.49" dur="4.05">bought their guns legally and these</text>
  <text start="225.56" dur="4.61">weren&amp;#39;t like any kind of ar-15s these</text>
  <text start="227.54" dur="5.01">were 45 a caliber it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="230.17" dur="4.93">but of course the Twittersphere is a</text>
  <text start="232.55" dur="4.5">flutter and all the prominent Democrats</text>
  <text start="235.1" dur="3.69">have taken this opportunity to start</text>
  <text start="237.05" dur="3.42">barking about gun control we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="238.79" dur="3.18">talk a little bit about their tweets but</text>
  <text start="240.47" dur="3.15">before we do let me hit you with this</text>
  <text start="241.97" dur="4.14">this is just from a few minutes ago from</text>
  <text start="243.62" dur="4.53">the Global Times man shot down by US</text>

  <text start="266.69" dur="3.72">condition of the man is unclear yet okay</text>

  <text start="270.41" dur="3.21">right now as it just happened a few</text>
  <text start="271.88" dur="4.47">minutes ago but I will definitely keep</text>
  <text start="273.62" dur="4.71">you posted if more details come up but</text>
  <text start="276.35" dur="3.42">very odd timing and of course I would</text>

  <text start="330.319" dur="3.93">pursuing a bad guy lots of pretty</text>
  <text start="332.269" dur="3.36">interesting thing to say about a shooter</text>
  <text start="334.249" dur="2.82">right okay well these are terrible</text>
  <text start="335.629" dur="3.6">stories and it shouldn&amp;#39;t really surprise</text>

  <text start="365.689" dur="3.57">couldn&amp;#39;t quite put my finger on it I</text>
  <text start="367.519" dur="3.54">want to turn your attention to a couple</text>
  <text start="369.259" dur="5.73">of tweets here this first one is from</text>

  <text start="389.929" dur="4.02">well I honestly don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve read</text>
  <text start="391.399" dur="5.61">all into this tweet but I&amp;#39;ve noticed a</text>
  <text start="393.949" dur="5.01">trend over the last really about a year</text>
  <text start="397.009" dur="3.33">or so and what I want to turn your</text>
  <text start="398.959" dur="5.55">attention onto is this billion dollar</text>
  <text start="400.339" dur="6.9">trade B D T and for those of you who are</text>
  <text start="404.509" dur="6.09">not familiar with that q has referenced</text>
  <text start="407.239" dur="6.45">BDT before and this was sort of uh had</text>
  <text start="410.599" dur="5.43">kind of crept in bonuses tweets also BDT</text>
  <text start="413.689" dur="4.26">meaning Bangladeshi time blunt and</text>
  <text start="416.029" dur="3.63">direct time either way you want to put</text>
  <text start="417.949" dur="4.98">it now I don&amp;#39;t have time to go through</text>
  <text start="419.659" dur="5.28">this whole review of what this meant but</text>
  <text start="422.929" dur="4.02">Q has I posted this before this was last</text>
  <text start="424.939" dur="4.59">year we had this attempt in a New York</text>
  <text start="426.949" dur="5.42">City Subway and Q was trying to tip us</text>
  <text start="429.529" dur="4.89">off to it saying BDT and we had</text>
  <text start="432.369" dur="2.811">basically we had figured out that that</text>
  <text start="434.419" dur="2.951">had</text>
  <text start="435.18" dur="5.04">been referring to Bangladeshi currency</text>
  <text start="437.37" dur="5.22">Bangladeshi tikka or Bangladeshi time</text>
  <text start="440.22" dur="3.96">whatever you want to call it but BDT</text>
  <text start="442.59" dur="4.92">what he was referring to was a</text>
  <text start="444.18" dur="5.49">Bangladeshi man who was attempting to it</text>
  <text start="447.51" dur="3.36">was a basically a bomb attempt warded</text>
  <text start="449.67" dur="2.73">and the guy didn&amp;#39;t really have much of a</text>
  <text start="450.87" dur="4.14">bomb after all anyway</text>
  <text start="452.4" dur="5.16">but that&amp;#39;s what BDT had meant and so I</text>
  <text start="455.01" dur="4.44">see this BDT again and it usually leads</text>
  <text start="457.56" dur="4.02">me to think that it&amp;#39;s some sort of event</text>
  <text start="459.45" dur="4.23">that&amp;#39;s been thwarted now I want to turn</text>
