  <text start="306.38" dur="4.92">redacted parts right here but here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="309.11" dur="5.25">what I want to talk about contacts</text>
  <text start="311.3" dur="6.209">between Trump via metaphor and the</text>
  <text start="314.36" dur="5.399">Kremlin that go back to about 2013 about</text>
  <text start="317.509" dur="5.431">the time he took Miss Universe to Moscow</text>
  <text start="319.759" dur="5.31">steel stressed that while Trump was film</text>
  <text start="322.94" dur="3.78">engaged in compromising activities with</text>
  <text start="325.069" dur="3.931">prostitutes in the ritz-carlton</text>
  <text start="326.72" dur="4.5">the Russians have not needed to use that</text>
  <text start="329" dur="5.55">compromise on him as he was already</text>
  <text start="331.22" dur="4.919">interested in cooperation Steele said he</text>
  <text start="334.55" dur="4.23">has persuaded the story about the</text>
  <text start="336.139" dur="4.471">prostitutes is accurate because they had</text>
  <text start="338.78" dur="4.77">their source speak with hotel contacts</text>
  <text start="340.61" dur="5.64">who confirmed one that the FSB was in</text>
  <text start="343.55" dur="5.16">the hotel while Trump was there okay and</text>
  <text start="346.25" dur="5.61">Trump regularly availed himself of</text>
  <text start="348.71" dur="5.4">prostitutes while in Moscow Steele</text>
  <text start="351.86" dur="5.399">indicated that this operation is run by</text>
  <text start="354.11" dur="6.6">the Kremlin former Kremlin cos Sergei</text>
  <text start="357.259" dur="6.871">Ivanov Dmitry Peskov and President Putin</text>
  <text start="360.71" dur="7.98">and not the FSB presidential advisor of</text>

  <text start="368.69" dur="4.64">Hoff former head of Russian external</text>
  <text start="371.24" dur="4.679">intelligence service are also involved</text>
  <text start="373.33" dur="5.139">Manta fort has been the go-between with</text>
  <text start="375.919" dur="4.351">the campaign even off persuaded Putin</text>
  <text start="378.469" dur="3.661">Putin it was possible to use the hacked</text>
  <text start="380.27" dur="3.869">information and run an operation without</text>
  <text start="382.13" dur="4.05">being detected while others argued</text>
  <text start="384.139" dur="3.451">against it all right so the reason I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="386.18" dur="3.15">taking you back here is because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="387.59" dur="4.229">been something kind of stuck in my craw</text>
  <text start="389.33" dur="4.23">regarding all this now I am no expert in</text>
  <text start="391.819" dur="3.6">all these Russian connections Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="393.56" dur="4.32">connections it&amp;#39;s really really really</text>
  <text start="395.419" dur="4.951">complicated but the essence of the story</text>
  <text start="397.88" dur="5.73">keeps kind of sticking out at me here we</text>
  <text start="400.37" dur="5.849">go these connections going back to 2013</text>
  <text start="403.61" dur="5.73">Orbis undertook the investigation in</text>
  <text start="406.219" dur="4.861">June of 2016 so you got Orbis</text>
  <text start="409.34" dur="4.29">Christopher Steele Glenn Simpson</text>
  <text start="411.08" dur="4.44">president Trump Putin man afford this is</text>
  <text start="413.63" dur="4.08">where all the connections start and from</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="4.5">there kind of branches out right but the</text>
  <text start="417.71" dur="4.32">point is that that I want to make is</text>
  <text start="420.02" dur="4.32">that this is where we we only start to</text>
  <text start="422.03" dur="4.919">kind of pivot towards Manta fort and if</text>
  <text start="424.34" dur="4.139">you remember mana 4 plead guilty to tax</text>
  <text start="426.949" dur="3.121">fraud and he got put away and he got put</text>
  <text start="428.479" dur="5.08">away a hard didn&amp;#39;t he as a matter of</text>
  <text start="430.07" dur="5.649">fact solitary confinement really for tax</text>
  <text start="433.559" dur="5.34">and of course he was a representative</text>
  <text start="435.719" dur="4.71">for Yanukovych back in the day so</text>
  <text start="438.899" dur="3.57">there&amp;#39;s your Ukraine connection well</text>
  <text start="440.429" dur="3.39">there&amp;#39;s our Ukraine connection right and</text>
  <text start="442.469" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s where it all starts to connect</text>
  <text start="443.819" dur="4.56">and like I said he got put away super</text>
  <text start="446.519" dur="2.76">super hard and it was Robert Muller who</text>
  <text start="448.379" dur="3.15">went after him</text>
  <text start="449.279" dur="4.56">so I always found this very very</text>
  <text start="451.529" dur="6.24">interesting and of course he also had</text>
  <text start="453.839" dur="6.69">this uh.this lobbying firm with Roger</text>
  <text start="457.769" dur="3.81">stone another guy they went after kind</text>
  <text start="460.529" dur="3.27">of excessively</text>
  <text start="461.579" dur="4.32">hard right so what&amp;#39;s this really about</text>
  <text start="463.799" dur="5.25">these climbs or was this really about</text>
  <text start="465.899" dur="4.71">maybe something that manna for new now</text>
  <text start="469.049" dur="3.33">we don&amp;#39;t really ever talk about that</text>
  <text start="470.609" dur="4.05">much because we don&amp;#39;t have any chance to</text>
  <text start="472.379" dur="3.93">get to him right that&amp;#39;s what I find so</text>
  <text start="474.659" dur="3.3">odd here we got a guy like Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="476.309" dur="3.9">Epstein who you would think would be</text>
  <text start="477.959" dur="6.12">public enemy number one somebody waltzed</text>
  <text start="480.209" dur="6.12">in and somehow hung him or whatever we</text>
  <text start="484.079" dur="4.02">know that whatever happened there with</text>
  <text start="486.329" dur="4.92">Jeffrey Epstein was bunk here we was in</text>
  <text start="488.099" dur="4.89">a maximum-security somebody was able to</text>
  <text start="491.249" dur="4.031">get to him and yet we can&amp;#39;t seem to get</text>
  <text start="492.989" dur="5.621">to Paul mana for why is that</text>

  <text start="572.24" dur="3.9">with here of course QED confirms here</text>
  <text start="573.98" dur="4.98">you que si es being a senior</text>
  <text start="576.14" dur="4.44">intelligence services White House CIA</text>
  <text start="578.96" dur="5.64">without the I because they know how the</text>
  <text start="580.58" dur="5.28">intelligence FBI DOJ joint treason now</text>
  <text start="584.6" dur="6.02">this is the curious part you have a</text>
  <text start="585.86" dur="7.29">choice I ask good agents the time is now</text>
  <text start="590.62" dur="5.26">contact windows and then we have good</text>
  <text start="593.15" dur="4.17">again in brackets good and then q says</text>
  <text start="595.88" dur="4.29">something very curious here which is</text>
  <text start="597.32" dur="6.36">what I want to point out biblical so</text>
  <text start="600.17" dur="5.13">look we&amp;#39;ve talked about this at great</text>
  <text start="603.68" dur="3.06">length here and the reason why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="605.3" dur="3.66">bringing this up here is this looks like</text>
  <text start="606.74" dur="5.34">you was giving a call back here in June</text>
  <text start="608.96" dur="5.64">of 2018 for some senior intelligence</text>
  <text start="612.08" dur="4.71">agents to come forward now what were</text>
  <text start="614.6" dur="3.84">they coming forward with not really sure</text>
  <text start="616.79" dur="4.08">the only thing that he leaves us is</text>
  <text start="618.44" dur="4.14">biblical what is a Bible a Bible is a</text>
  <text start="620.87" dur="2.94">collection of books and I&amp;#39;ve put this</text>
  <text start="622.58" dur="2.81">out before and I&amp;#39;m gonna put it out</text>
  <text start="623.81" dur="4.08">again because this is my whole point</text>
  <text start="625.39" dur="4.72">when I put it out before I asked about</text>
  <text start="627.89" dur="4.77">this and I got a lot of different</text>
  <text start="630.11" dur="3.419">responses in regards to the Holy Bible</text>
  <text start="632.66" dur="3.239">and rav-4</text>
  <text start="633.529" dur="4.56">and good and evil and deep stories and I</text>
  <text start="635.899" dur="4.5">get that but I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s what Q</text>
  <text start="638.089" dur="4.261">is talking about here a Bible is simply</text>
  <text start="640.399" dur="3.87">a collection of books Q isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="642.35" dur="4.83">necessarily referencing the Holy Bible</text>
  <text start="644.269" dur="4.92">now I think in some cases we are I do</text>
  <text start="647.18" dur="3.659">think there&amp;#39;s a bigger picture here and</text>
  <text start="649.189" dur="3.421">I&amp;#39;m not discounting that but I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="650.839" dur="3.87">saying in this particular case I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="652.61" dur="5.099">wondering if this this biblical</text>
  <text start="654.709" dur="4.86">reference especially in the context of</text>
  <text start="657.709" dur="4.201">where we&amp;#39;re just taking it here wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="659.569" dur="5.13">something very much along the lines of</text>
  <text start="661.91" dur="4.56">maybe who knows a collection of Ledger&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="664.699" dur="2.82">now we don&amp;#39;t know if that mana fort</text>
  <text start="666.47" dur="3.059">ledger was good or not because we</text>
  <text start="667.519" dur="3.48">haven&amp;#39;t seen it and we don&amp;#39;t really have</text>
  <text start="669.529" dur="3.93">anything to verify it so there&amp;#39;s no real</text>
  <text start="670.999" dur="4.861">way of knowing but my only point is that</text>
  <text start="673.459" dur="5.461">here you got this guy Paul Manafort who</text>
  <text start="675.86" dur="5.49">has been around for a very very long</text>
  <text start="678.92" dur="5.099">time as advised a lot of people as a</text>
  <text start="681.35" dur="4.589">matter of fact it was rumored data back</text>
  <text start="684.019" dur="4.56">in the day mana Ford had even warned</text>
  <text start="685.939" dur="4.95">Reagan about Bush senior this goes back</text>
  <text start="688.579" dur="3.75">to even Prescott Bush and a lot I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="690.889" dur="3.75">want to go way back into that but just</text>
  <text start="692.329" dur="4.62">keep in mind that man afford knew the</text>
  <text start="694.639" dur="2.971">goods on everybody whether or not he was</text>
  <text start="696.949" dur="3">good or bad</text>
  <text start="697.61" dur="4.289">he was probably capitalizing off of both</text>
  <text start="699.949" dur="3.87">sides that&amp;#39;s the way it least looks like</text>
  <text start="701.899" dur="4.05">to me but either way he was maintaining</text>
  <text start="703.819" dur="4.231">some Ledger&amp;#39;s and whether this ledger</text>
  <text start="705.949" dur="4.5">was good enough to be the basis for the</text>
  <text start="708.05" dur="3.81">Trump Russia collusion thing doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="710.449" dur="4.021">really matter it got it all started</text>
  <text start="711.86" dur="4.349">right and if there&amp;#39;s one ledger maybe</text>
  <text start="714.47" dur="2.76">there&amp;#39;s other Ledger&amp;#39;s after all the</text>
  <text start="716.209" dur="3.541">best way to keep some of this</text>
  <text start="717.23" dur="4.74">information isn&amp;#39;t to put it on some sort</text>
  <text start="719.75" dur="4.949">of you know computer chip or you know</text>
  <text start="721.97" dur="4.77">card or whatever it is it&amp;#39;s hand-to-hand</text>
  <text start="724.699" dur="4.651">submission right or just keeping it</text>
  <text start="726.74" dur="4.889">buried so maybe these books on Ledger&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="729.35" dur="4.469">are stashed all over the places and</text>
  <text start="731.629" dur="3.841">maybe these good agents just happen to</text>
  <text start="733.819" dur="3">be aware of some of the locations and</text>
  <text start="735.47" dur="3.39">can release such at a time as a matter</text>
  <text start="736.819" dur="5.341">of fact this information would be so</text>
  <text start="738.86" dur="5.61">important that it would be worth putting</text>
  <text start="742.16" dur="4.619">somebody like metaphor in solitary</text>
  <text start="744.47" dur="4.109">confinement over right after all when</text>
  <text start="746.779" dur="3.99">they wanted him to testify they wanted</text>
  <text start="748.579" dur="3.81">him to testify about the Ukraine his</text>
  <text start="750.769" dur="3.271">dealings they wanted to know what he did</text>
  <text start="752.389" dur="3.12">and that was all they cared about and</text>
  <text start="754.04" dur="3.479">then they dropped the hammer and put him</text>
  <text start="755.509" dur="3.601">away we never heard from him again well</text>
  <text start="757.519" dur="4.92">what if he had some other things to say</text>
  <text start="759.11" dur="5.279">well if he had some other things to say</text>
  <text start="762.439" dur="3.931">to have a Nunez asti&amp;#39;s that he might</text>
  <text start="764.389" dur="2.641">have some more to say which leads me a</text>
  <text start="766.37" dur="2.88">thing</text>
  <text start="767.03" dur="5.19">without maybe this biblical reference is</text>
  <text start="769.25" dur="4.83">indeed a sign that there are more</text>
  <text start="772.22" dur="4.59">Ledger&amp;#39;s to come or at least more</text>
  <text start="774.08" dur="5.18">sources of information to come</text>
  <text start="776.81" dur="5.04">Paul metaphor might very well have been</text>
  <text start="779.26" dur="4.45">privy to that information keep in mind</text>
  <text start="781.85" dur="5.25">this guy has been around for so long</text>
  <text start="783.71" dur="5.55">shoot he posed as a CNN reporter to get</text>
  <text start="787.1" dur="5.07">information from Indian interview this</text>
  <text start="789.26" dur="4.95">guy was wrapped up in HUD this guy was</text>
  <text start="792.17" dur="3.66">wrapped up in everything so if he was</text>
  <text start="794.21" dur="4.74">wrapped up in everything you wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="795.83" dur="4.95">want to keep a any kind of records of</text>
  <text start="798.95" dur="3.6">this on some sort of computer format you</text>
  <text start="800.78" dur="3.69">would probably want to do it all by hand</text>
  <text start="802.55" dur="3.66">and that was exactly the implication of</text>
  <text start="804.47" dur="3.18">this ledger even though we talked about</text>
  <text start="806.21" dur="2.76">the steel dossier all the time we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="807.65" dur="3.87">really talk much about this ledger</text>
  <text start="808.97" dur="5.58">whether or not it&amp;#39;s bunk I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="811.52" dur="4.56">but just a suggestion for you and for</text>
  <text start="814.55" dur="5.13">those of you who might be privy to this</text>
  <text start="816.08" dur="5.16">you can let me know now before we go on</text>
  <text start="819.68" dur="3.12">to the next story I want to point out my</text>
  <text start="821.24" dur="3.18">last two videos because it&amp;#39;ll probably</text>
  <text start="822.8" dur="3.63">help give a little context to what I</text>
  <text start="824.42" dur="5.19">want to talk about next they&amp;#39;re entitled</text>
  <text start="826.43" dur="5.67">orange band bad from the 23rd and in</text>
  <text start="829.61" dur="4.47">peachy from the 25th and both videos</text>
  <text start="832.1" dur="3.96">touch up on some incidents that had</text>
  <text start="834.08" dur="5.52">happened in Pittsburgh in the Pittsburgh</text>
  <text start="836.06" dur="5.279">area particularly this overdose or a</text>
  <text start="839.6" dur="3.75">poisoning or something like that but</text>
  <text start="841.339" dur="3.811">they were wearing these orange bands as</text>
  <text start="843.35" dur="3.54">if they were coming from an event now</text>
  <text start="845.15" dur="4.05">from what I always understood sometimes</text>
  <text start="846.89" dur="4.23">you would do like you could do military</text>
  <text start="849.2" dur="3.81">exercises and stuff like that and if you</text>
  <text start="851.12" dur="3.42">were using mash casually or anything</text>
  <text start="853.01" dur="3.9">like that or something where you wanted</text>
  <text start="854.54" dur="4.47">to do you know kind of DeMarco you might</text>
  <text start="856.91" dur="3.69">use these bands but these bands also</text>
  <text start="859.01" dur="4.17">could have been from a nightclub or you</text>
  <text start="860.6" dur="4.95">know who knows but either way they found</text>
  <text start="863.18" dur="4.05">people dead the other few people were in</text>
  <text start="865.55" dur="4.41">the hospital go back and check out</text>
  <text start="867.23" dur="5.82">orange band bad in regards to that but</text>
  <text start="869.96" dur="5.97">at the same time we also had an active</text>
  <text start="873.05" dur="4.98">crisis drill that was going on and that</text>
  <text start="875.93" dur="6.03">was gonna be based at the David Lawrence</text>
  <text start="878.03" dur="5.52">Center in Pittsburgh and so I was asking</text>
  <text start="881.96" dur="3.24">some of you guys to keep out you know</text>
  <text start="883.55" dur="2.73">keep eye out for anything that was going</text>
  <text start="885.2" dur="3.6">on and of course a lot of you guys</text>
  <text start="886.28" dur="4.53">responded saying there was a ton of you</text>
  <text start="888.8" dur="3.9">know military stuff that you saw in the</text>
  <text start="890.81" dur="3.69">area helicopters planes a lot of you</text>
  <text start="892.7" dur="3.18">guys had kind of the same stories just</text>
  <text start="894.5" dur="3.93">in different areas but it was all</text>
  <text start="895.88" dur="4.72">roughly the same area so I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="898.43" dur="4.6">rehash than the stories that I just</text>
  <text start="900.6" dur="5.88">but we talked about that more in this</text>
  <text start="903.03" dur="4.83">video here entitled in peachy but I just</text>
  <text start="906.48" dur="3.24">wanted to point out that that&amp;#39;s what we</text>
  <text start="907.86" dur="3.75">were looking at well lo and behold we</text>
  <text start="909.72" dur="3.57">did have an event at a David Lawrence</text>

  <text start="978.78" dur="3.63">David Lawrence Center okay so this was</text>
  <text start="980.58" dur="3.63">clear across the country but oddly</text>
  <text start="982.41" dur="3.9">enough I had just been talking about an</text>
  <text start="984.21" dur="3.72">event going on possibly at the David</text>
  <text start="986.31" dur="4.14">Lawrence Center well we knew that their</text>
  <text start="987.93" dur="4.44">active crisis drill was going to go on</text>
  <text start="990.45" dur="4.32">we didn&amp;#39;t exactly know we had also had a</text>
  <text start="992.37" dur="4.62">tip of the nearby US Steel Center being</text>
  <text start="994.77" dur="5.25">evacuated and of course this had all</text>
  <text start="996.99" dur="5.1">happened within under five miles of</text>
  <text start="1000.02" dur="4.02">where we had this original situation</text>
  <text start="1002.09" dur="3.6">with the orange band so like I said</text>
  <text start="1004.04" dur="3.75">watch those two videos if you want to</text>
  <text start="1005.69" dur="3.48">get some context here so it looks like</text>
  <text start="1007.79" dur="3.18">we were definitely onto something here</text>
  <text start="1009.17" dur="4.56">but it turned out to be a David Lawrence</text>
  <text start="1010.97" dur="5.97">Center in Florida now they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1013.73" dur="5.94">that this was not an actual event that</text>
  <text start="1016.94" dur="6.15">that this was proven to be it says no</text>
  <text start="1019.67" dur="7.08">active shooter found but multiple 9-1-1</text>
  <text start="1023.09" dur="6.54">calls okay well oddly enough also in</text>
  <text start="1026.75" dur="5.699">this in this video in peachy I mentioned</text>
  <text start="1029.63" dur="4.679">about a it was another</text>
  <text start="1032.449" dur="3.36">public service announcement saying that</text>
  <text start="1034.309" dur="4.201">there was an event going on at the</text>

  <text start="1041.839" dur="2.82">dock dock and once again go back to the</text>
  <text start="1043.429" dur="4.38">video if you want to get the details but</text>
  <text start="1044.659" dur="4.531">this was another military exercise and</text>
  <text start="1047.809" dur="3.631">just like the military exercise in</text>
  <text start="1049.19" dur="4.29">Pittsburgh we had a corresponding event</text>
  <text start="1051.44" dur="4.38">Chicago Police say then a bomb threat</text>
  <text start="1053.48" dur="5.25">that briefly shut down downtown CTA</text>
  <text start="1055.82" dur="5.31">service in the loop was unfair unfounded</text>
  <text start="1058.73" dur="4.5">and trains have resumed their regular</text>

  <text start="1070.1" dur="3.949">interrupted by the threat but the CTA</text>
  <text start="1071.96" dur="5.61">now says the trains are resuming service</text>

  <text start="1077.57" dur="4.68">delays are still expected of course</text>
  <text start="1079.61" dur="4.679">here&amp;#39;s the Twitter advisement here so</text>
  <text start="1082.25" dur="4.049">here we go we had another military</text>
  <text start="1084.289" dur="3.811">exercise right at the same time and then</text>
  <text start="1086.299" dur="3.36">a corresponding event no are they</text>
  <text start="1088.1" dur="5.04">related I&amp;#39;m not really sure but it seems</text>
  <text start="1089.659" dur="6.331">mathematically very very improbable</text>
  <text start="1093.14" dur="5.159">right and we had just talked about this</text>
  <text start="1095.99" dur="4.65">today before what I found curious about</text>
  <text start="1098.299" dur="5.6">both of these events is that they</text>
  <text start="1100.64" dur="7.83">happened within 48 hours of my video a</text>
  <text start="1103.899" dur="6.581">but that they also turned out to be just</text>
  <text start="1108.47" dur="4.23">these sort of empty threats yet threats</text>
  <text start="1110.48" dur="4.199">being called in so it makes me wonder</text>
  <text start="1112.7" dur="3.69">what the motive for these situations</text>
  <text start="1114.679" dur="4.5">were is it&amp;#39;s just something to debunk</text>
  <text start="1116.39" dur="5.1">maybe say I don&amp;#39;t know my news I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1119.179" dur="3.99">really know or were these real</text>
  <text start="1121.49" dur="3.659">situations that just got tipped off I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1123.169" dur="5.971">not really sure but either way I find it</text>
  <text start="1125.149" dur="6.241">very very curious finally let me leave</text>
  <text start="1129.14" dur="5.1">you with this stem cells for dozens of</text>
  <text start="1131.39" dur="5.25">cancer patients destroyed after freezer</text>
  <text start="1134.24" dur="5.309">malfunction at Children&amp;#39;s Hospital LA</text>
  <text start="1136.64" dur="5.039">more than four dozen cancer patients at</text>
  <text start="1139.549" dur="4.5">Children&amp;#39;s Hospital Los Angeles lost</text>
  <text start="1141.679" dur="4.73">their stored stem cells when a freezer</text>
  <text start="1144.049" dur="4.831">at the hospital failed those stem cells</text>
  <text start="1146.409" dur="4.841">harvested from the children before they</text>
  <text start="1148.88" dur="4.769">underwent chemotherapy and radiation</text>
  <text start="1151.25" dur="4.62">treatments were frozen in case their</text>
  <text start="1153.649" dur="4.051">cancer should return one of the freezer</text>
  <text start="1155.87" dur="4.23">sensors failed and the notification</text>
  <text start="1157.7" dur="6">process failed and so we lost those</text>
  <text start="1160.1" dur="5.49">specimens at James dr. James Stein CH la</text>
  <text start="1163.7" dur="4.38">s chief medical officer</text>
  <text start="1165.59" dur="4.74">added that the families of 56 children</text>
  <text start="1168.08" dur="5.219">have been notified of the stem cell loss</text>
  <text start="1170.33" dur="4.8">Sean Anderson Cora Noah 13 is one of the</text>
  <text start="1173.299" dur="3.931">patients who stem cells were destroyed</text>
  <text start="1175.13" dur="3.929">the eighth grader went through stem cell</text>
  <text start="1177.23" dur="4.98">therapy when he was diagnosed with stage</text>
  <text start="1179.059" dur="5.131">4 neuroblastoma and in November he&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="1182.21" dur="4.17">cancer-free for three years well</text>
  <text start="1184.19" dur="4.08">congratulations Sean but harvesting</text>
  <text start="1186.38" dur="4.56">those stem cells can be a grueling</text>
  <text start="1188.27" dur="4.649">ordeal for children yeah harvesting and</text>
  <text start="1190.94" dur="4.17">children always sounds bad just you know</text>
  <text start="1192.919" dur="3.961">in general the process involves</text>
  <text start="1195.11" dur="3.419">injections and requires the child to be</text>
  <text start="1196.88" dur="3.6">hooked up for a day or two the machines</text>
  <text start="1198.529" dur="4.051">that separate the stem cells from the</text>
  <text start="1200.48" dur="3.6">rest of the blood it was painful Sean</text>
  <text start="1202.58" dur="2.969">said I would try to sleep and my body</text>
  <text start="1204.08" dur="2.94">would just start shaking and then I just</text>
  <text start="1205.549" dur="4.531">started to freak out and I&amp;#39;d start</text>
  <text start="1207.02" dur="5.19">crying Sean&amp;#39;s mother Elizabeth Anderson</text>
  <text start="1210.08" dur="3.93">is worried that should her son&amp;#39;s cancer</text>
  <text start="1212.21" dur="3.839">return it may not be possible to harvest</text>
  <text start="1214.01" dur="4.139">more stem cells from his blood</text>
  <text start="1216.049" dur="3.541">once you&amp;#39;ve through that whole process</text>
  <text start="1218.149" dur="3.211">of doing all the treatment you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1219.59" dur="4.41">damaged your body said Anderson that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1221.36" dur="4.799">how damaging chemo is or the radiation</text>
  <text start="1224" dur="3.809">alone and so it&amp;#39;s the same with the stem</text>
  <text start="1226.159" dur="4.89">cells he doesn&amp;#39;t have that as an option</text>
  <text start="1227.809" dur="5.34">to just collect more however Stine says</text>
  <text start="1231.049" dur="4.291">the patients who lost their stem cells</text>
  <text start="1233.149" dur="4.351">to the freezer failure can go through</text>
  <text start="1235.34" dur="3.24">the harvesting process again all right</text>
  <text start="1237.5" dur="2.37">and I guess that&amp;#39;s the part that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1238.58" dur="4.65">really disturbing and this breaks my</text>
  <text start="1239.87" dur="5.07">heart for this young kid here but I find</text>
  <text start="1243.23" dur="3.78">this very strange that this freezer just</text>
  <text start="1244.94" dur="4.26">all said breaks down everybody loses it</text>
  <text start="1247.01" dur="4.019">and this is coming of course on the</text>
  <text start="1249.2" dur="3.51">heels of Planned Parenthood losing all</text>
  <text start="1251.029" dur="4.741">this funding I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="1252.71" dur="6.15">unrelated but here we go and this was</text>
  <text start="1255.77" dur="5.639">just a freezer failure malfunction and</text>
  <text start="1258.86" dur="5.01">now they&amp;#39;re encouraging people to go</text>
  <text start="1261.409" dur="5.461">through the harvesting process again how</text>
  <text start="1263.87" dur="4.77">about that we&amp;#39;re there to be a</text>
  <text start="1266.87" dur="3.419">recurrence of disease that requires stem</text>
  <text start="1268.64" dur="3.36">cells the patients can have the stem</text>
  <text start="1270.289" dur="3.961">cells collected again Stein said</text>
  <text start="1272" dur="4.49">Anderson is also upset that the hospital</text>
  <text start="1274.25" dur="5.22">notified families by mailing a letter</text>
  <text start="1276.49" dur="5.38">last week one that was addressed to her</text>
  <text start="1279.47" dur="3.36">son she said had she known that was what</text>
  <text start="1281.87" dur="3.6">was in the letter she would have chosen</text>
  <text start="1282.83" dur="4.38">not to tell Sean instead the boy read of</text>
  <text start="1285.47" dur="3.059">the stem cell lost and burst into tears</text>
  <text start="1287.21" dur="3.089">all right well this is really really</text>
  <text start="1288.529" dur="3.221">horrible but I want to point one more</text>
  <text start="1290.299" dur="4.61">thing out here</text>
  <text start="1291.75" dur="5.74">this is what says basically what</text>
  <text start="1294.909" dur="4.5">happened since then safeguards were in</text>
  <text start="1297.49" dur="3.659">place at the time but were insufficient</text>
  <text start="1299.409" dur="3.181">since that time we have replaced the</text>
  <text start="1301.149" dur="3.841">freezer that malfunctioned</text>
  <text start="1302.59" dur="4.86">upgraded our sensor monitoring and alert</text>
  <text start="1304.99" dur="4.77">system double-checked all power supply</text>
  <text start="1307.45" dur="4.079">resources or excuse me all power supply</text>
  <text start="1309.76" dur="3.09">sources increased our maintenance</text>
  <text start="1311.529" dur="3.721">schedule and launched training for the</text>
  <text start="1312.85" dur="4.01">engineering team on the new system Wow</text>
  <text start="1315.25" dur="3.69">so you&amp;#39;ve got a lot done since then</text>
  <text start="1316.86" dur="4.179">which leads me to think that you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1318.94" dur="3.27">always been able to do that which leads</text>
  <text start="1321.039" dur="3.061">me to think that maybe those safeguards</text>
  <text start="1322.21" dur="4.189">were always in place right safeguards</text>
  <text start="1324.1" dur="4.38">were in place this was a big deal and</text>
  <text start="1326.399" dur="3.49">you know I mean I don&amp;#39;t know this kid</text>
  <text start="1328.48" dur="3.51">Shawn I don&amp;#39;t know if this is even a</text>
  <text start="1329.889" dur="4.53">real kid Shawn I wouldn&amp;#39;t challenge that</text>
  <text start="1331.99" dur="3.899">my only point is that this is a horrible</text>
  <text start="1334.419" dur="3.75">horrible story for these people to go</text>
  <text start="1335.889" dur="3.75">through very very painful process and</text>
  <text start="1338.169" dur="3.901">they all suddenly want to harvest again</text>
  <text start="1339.639" dur="4.981">my bad and they just basically sent an</text>
  <text start="1342.07" dur="5.43">apology by mail and somehow were able to</text>
  <text start="1344.62" dur="4.38">upgrade all this stuff in record time</text>
  <text start="1347.5" dur="2.94">would it would seem I don&amp;#39;t really know</text>
  <text start="1349" dur="3.87">what the timeframe was but this seems</text>
  <text start="1350.44" dur="4.44">very very strange to me now I also want</text>
  <text start="1352.87" dur="4.2">to point out because the obvious search</text>
  <text start="1354.88" dur="4.71">that I went from there was their</text>
  <text start="1357.07" dur="4.109">proximity at Children&amp;#39;s Hospital to</text>
  <text start="1359.59" dur="3.66">Planned Parenthood as you can see right</text>
  <text start="1361.179" dur="3.87">there it&amp;#39;s under a mile so it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="1363.25" dur="4.169">stone&amp;#39;s throw away and of course that</text>
  <text start="1365.049" dur="3.84">leads me to my next search only a couple</text>
  <text start="1367.419" dur="4.14">miles really about a little under three</text>
  <text start="1368.889" dur="3.841">miles to the nearest FedEx and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1371.559" dur="2.701">gonna go into that story for those</text>
  <text start="1372.73" dur="2.939">people who understand where I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="1374.26" dur="3.299">with you know where I&amp;#39;m going with but</text>
  <text start="1375.669" dur="3.331">I&amp;#39;m not necessarily saying that or</text>
  <text start="1377.559" dur="2.87">implying that or anything like that but</text>
  <text start="1379" dur="3.6">I just find this very very odd</text>
  <text start="1380.429" dur="3.761">particularly at this time where a</text>
  <text start="1382.6" dur="3.5">Planned Parenthood is losing their</text>
  <text start="1384.19" dur="4.38">funding that something like this so</text>
  <text start="1386.1" dur="5.35">irresponsible would happen and it just</text>
  <text start="1388.57" dur="4.229">happens to do with harvesting children&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1391.45" dur="2.79">stem cells</text>
  <text start="1392.799" dur="2.941">alright Patriots that&amp;#39;s all I got for</text>
