  <text start="49.9" dur="7.409">was 500 pages thick after 100 pages I</text>
  <text start="55.229" dur="3.941">couldn&amp;#39;t believe what I was reading and</text>
  <text start="57.309" dur="4.801">I was in denial and I put the book away</text>
  <text start="59.17" dur="5.58">and I said to my partner this cannot be</text>
  <text start="62.11" dur="6.84">true I can&amp;#39;t believe this this is to two</text>
  <text start="64.75" dur="6.479">horrible horrific I decided to keep</text>

  <text start="71.229" dur="6.811">about a week but I kept reading and I</text>
  <text start="74.65" dur="6.66">did a lot of research about what this</text>
  <text start="78.04" dur="6.18">lady was writing and I had to admit</text>
  <text start="81.31" dur="6.87">every time that I researched something</text>
  <text start="84.22" dur="6.27">it appeared to be true based on a lot of</text>
  <text start="88.18" dur="7.53">facts that I found about a certain</text>
  <text start="90.49" dur="8.82">subject after finishing the book I was a</text>
  <text start="95.71" dur="5.69">little depressed and I had a good</text>
  <text start="99.31" dur="6.99">insight about the pedophilia ring</text>
  <text start="101.4" dur="8.68">worldwide and but I it was hurting me so</text>
  <text start="106.3" dur="8.64">much that I decided to stop researching</text>
  <text start="110.08" dur="8.15">it and to bury it and I did but then in</text>
  <text start="114.94" dur="5.73">January I heard about the false flag</text>
  <text start="118.23" dur="5.89">alarm in Hawaii and I thought it was</text>
  <text start="120.67" dur="5.73">very very odd so I researched that a</text>
  <text start="124.12" dur="7.41">little bit and I came to the conclusion</text>

  <text start="131.53" dur="3.43">have had</text>
  <text start="132.38" dur="6.11">and there were various theories that I</text>
  <text start="134.96" dur="7.23">could find any alternative media about</text>
  <text start="138.49" dur="9.64">the reason why it happened it was about</text>
  <text start="142.19" dur="7.65">a nuclear bomb about a submarine and I</text>
  <text start="148.13" dur="3.45">thought it was really hard to find out</text>
