  <text start="126.59" dur="4.86">playing but yeah that was that was some</text>
  <text start="129.8" dur="4.29">theater right there let me take you over</text>
  <text start="131.45" dur="4.08">here to this tweet from Mark Levin Nancy</text>
  <text start="134.09" dur="3.51">Pelosi was apparently advised by a</text>
  <text start="135.53" dur="4.14">left-wing horror Harvard Law Professor</text>
  <text start="137.6" dur="3.33">Lawrence tribe to delay sending the</text>
  <text start="139.67" dur="3.69">impeachment to the Senate</text>
  <text start="140.93" dur="4.369">so she&amp;#39;s unilaterally sitting on the</text>
  <text start="143.36" dur="4.409">impeachment this is another brazen</text>
  <text start="145.299" dur="4.241">unconstitutional act here&amp;#39;s what Mitch</text>
  <text start="147.769" dur="3.811">McConnell and the Senate Republicans</text>
  <text start="149.54" dur="4.11">must do in response the Senate has the</text>
  <text start="151.58" dur="4.739">sole power under the Constitution to</text>
  <text start="153.65" dur="4.5">educate an impeachment therefore Pelosi</text>
  <text start="156.319" dur="4.021">is attempting to obstruct the Senate&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="158.15" dur="4.32">power to act on its constitutional</text>
  <text start="160.34" dur="4.02">authority yeah and I think like I said I</text>
  <text start="162.47" dur="3.359">think she&amp;#39;s just waiting to see if they</text>
  <text start="164.36" dur="3.33">really want to test the waters and just</text>
  <text start="165.829" dur="4.051">see how many people they can continue to</text>
  <text start="167.69" dur="4.169">flip kind of work in the opposite way</text>
  <text start="169.88" dur="3.9">and that seems to at least be the</text>
  <text start="171.859" dur="3.63">attempted strategy number three</text>
  <text start="173.78" dur="3.78">McConnell should immediately put an end</text>
  <text start="175.489" dur="4.201">to this and then clear the impeachment</text>
  <text start="177.56" dur="4.11">null and void as the speaker has failed</text>
  <text start="179.69" dur="3.66">to complete the impeachment process by</text>
  <text start="181.67" dur="4.5">timely sending it to the Senate for</text>
  <text start="183.35" dur="5.16">education McConnell has no less</text>
  <text start="186.17" dur="4.379">authority to unilaterally make such a</text>
  <text start="188.51" dur="3.93">decision than Pelosi does to withhold</text>
  <text start="190.549" dur="3.991">the administrative notification of an</text>
  <text start="192.44" dur="4.74">impeachment to the Senate either</text>
  <text start="194.54" dur="4.319">indefinitely or with conditions her</text>
  <text start="197.18" dur="4.02">effort to cripple the presidency and</text>
  <text start="198.859" dur="4.741">blackmail the Senate must be defeated</text>
  <text start="201.2" dur="3.869">well I would agree with Mark Levin well</text>
  <text start="203.6" dur="3.21">I&amp;#39;m not calling the great one just</text>
  <text start="205.069" dur="3.48">saying he&amp;#39;s pretty good one now I saw</text>

  <text start="897.22" dur="4.17">just sum this up here this is an excerpt</text>
  <text start="900.1" dur="4.53">from The Washington Post</text>
  <text start="901.39" dur="5.25">back in 2017 after the fiasco of the Bay</text>

  <text start="920.55" dur="5.77">Robert would meet at least 35 times an</text>

  <text start="940.72" dur="4.32">the press and public knew nothing about</text>
  <text start="942.58" dur="4.26">these meetings but Kennedy also kept</text>
  <text start="945.04" dur="4.11">most of them a secret from the rest of</text>
  <text start="946.84" dur="4.71">his administration National Security</text>
  <text start="949.15" dur="4.47">Advisor McGeorge Bundy would not know</text>
  <text start="951.55" dur="4.59">the extent of these meetings until three</text>

  <text start="960.88" dur="4.74">speechwriter Theodore Sorensen knew</text>
  <text start="963.73" dur="4.38">little of these contacts at the time</text>
  <text start="965.62" dur="4.08">Robert often met with the Soviet agent</text>

  <text start="971.86" dur="5.22">tete-a-tete but the CIA was in the dark</text>
  <text start="975.07" dur="3.81">alright sounds a little bit familiar we</text>
  <text start="977.08" dur="3.63">can kind of draw some parallels with</text>
  <text start="978.88" dur="4.2">that right and of course Q is implying</text>
  <text start="980.71" dur="4.23">that they&amp;#39;re not just speaking to us do</text>

  <text start="984.94" dur="3.59">the entire world is following this at</text>
  <text start="986.98" dur="6.33">this point bigger than you can imagine</text>
  <text start="988.53" dur="6.61">expand you are thinking so keep in mind</text>
  <text start="993.31" dur="4.11">we talked yesterday about a possible</text>
  <text start="995.14" dur="5.04">back-channel with Trump and Putin which</text>
  <text start="997.42" dur="4.83">draws a lot of parallels to JFK back in</text>

  <text start="1002.25" dur="4.68">exchange about a year or so ago with</text>

  <text start="1008.82" dur="3.81">in your court seemed like there was some</text>
  <text start="1010.74" dur="3.63">sort of talking going back and forth</text>
  <text start="1012.63" dur="3.36">there and of course John Bolton seemed</text>
  <text start="1014.37" dur="3.63">to be in on this too but it looks like</text>
  <text start="1015.99" dur="3.42">President Trump and not really just</text>
  <text start="1018" dur="3.3">President Trump but world leaders in</text>
  <text start="1019.41" dur="3.72">general are probably having to use back</text>
