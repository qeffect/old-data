  <text start="20.09" dur="5.07">reason I am doing so is because I want</text>
  <text start="21.68" dur="6.24">to show you this is our last video from</text>
  <text start="25.16" dur="5.07">March 24th this covers the latest q and</text>
  <text start="27.92" dur="4.319">on post there are three of them we are</text>
  <text start="30.23" dur="3.509">going to talk about them today more</text>
  <text start="32.239" dur="3.541">importantly we are going to talk about</text>
  <text start="33.739" dur="4.201">some related theories regarding these</text>
  <text start="35.78" dur="3.72">posts and then we are going to try and</text>
  <text start="37.94" dur="3.299">draw a summary and see if we can find</text>
  <text start="39.5" dur="4.89">anything that ties our all together that</text>
  <text start="41.239" dur="4.711">is the goal okay now before I get</text>
  <text start="44.39" dur="3.09">started on this I want to want you to</text>
  <text start="45.95" dur="3.66">understand something very very clearly</text>
  <text start="47.48" dur="4.62">there are lots of different directions</text>
  <text start="49.61" dur="5.01">that these q posts can go in and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="52.1" dur="5.459">lots of details there&amp;#39;s lots of minutiae</text>
  <text start="54.62" dur="5.579">that we can debate all day long you may</text>
  <text start="57.559" dur="4.98">be right you may be wrong and you may be</text>
  <text start="60.199" dur="5.011">somewhere in between but what&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="62.539" dur="4.47">important that I submit to you is that</text>
  <text start="65.21" dur="4.049">we stick to a narrative and we try to</text>
  <text start="67.009" dur="3.78">find an end goal to all of this now we</text>
  <text start="69.259" dur="3.961">can debate a lot of details but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="70.789" dur="4.83">more important is what is Q trying to</text>
  <text start="73.22" dur="4.259">get us to rally behind pretty soon we</text>
  <text start="75.619" dur="4.471">are going to find ourselves in the</text>
  <text start="77.479" dur="5.131">mainstream media probably being</text>
  <text start="80.09" dur="5.49">ridiculed and discredited and if we are</text>
  <text start="82.61" dur="6">debating about colors of castles or</text>
  <text start="85.58" dur="4.86">zeroes and pluses we may be missing the</text>
  <text start="88.61" dur="4.08">point and we won&amp;#39;t be able to share our</text>
  <text start="90.44" dur="4.34">message with the masses that being said</text>
  <text start="92.69" dur="4.379">we&amp;#39;re gonna get started on these q posts</text>
  <text start="94.78" dur="6.31">and just stick with me here we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="97.069" dur="7.561">lots to work on gonna mostly work on Q&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="184.76" dur="2.67">have a lot of posts regarding the</text>
  <text start="186.079" dur="3">Keystone I&amp;#39;m not going to show you one</text>
  <text start="187.43" dur="3.72">here on the Q map but if you just</text>

  <text start="197.93" dur="5.489">been many people who are talking about</text>
  <text start="199.629" dur="8.13">castling and its relation to the game of</text>
  <text start="203.419" dur="7.141">chess so if we type in chess we will see</text>
  <text start="207.759" dur="4.44">lots of different references obviously</text>
  <text start="210.56" dur="5.099">we&amp;#39;re not gonna cover them all but</text>
  <text start="212.199" dur="6.22">obviously Q wants us to know something</text>
  <text start="215.659" dur="5.64">about chess so many people are talking</text>
  <text start="218.419" dur="4.981">about the idea of the move of castling</text>
  <text start="221.299" dur="3.81">in chess and what is chicken what is</text>
  <text start="223.4" dur="4.5">castling I&amp;#39;m gonna show you here this is</text>
  <text start="225.109" dur="4.861">chess corner calm and we&amp;#39;re not gonna go</text>
  <text start="227.9" dur="4.53">deep into this it could be a reference</text>
  <text start="229.97" dur="5.729">to a political move there is a theory</text>
  <text start="232.43" dur="5.85">about a famous chess match in which the</text>
  <text start="235.699" dur="3.99">person that was losing used this move in</text>
  <text start="238.28" dur="2.31">order to win it&amp;#39;s usually kind of a</text>
  <text start="239.689" dur="3.66">desperation move</text>
  <text start="240.59" dur="4.619">it&amp;#39;s definitely sort of a defensive move</text>
  <text start="243.349" dur="3.39">and so there&amp;#39;s a lot of theories</text>
  <text start="245.209" dur="3.06">relating to that now going into that</text>
  <text start="246.739" dur="3.48">just showing you that this is what the</text>
  <text start="248.269" dur="3.771">theory is and I want you to know what</text>
  <text start="250.219" dur="4.35">the move is you can understand it in</text>
  <text start="252.04" dur="4.689">relation to context when you&amp;#39;re hearing</text>
  <text start="254.569" dur="3.331">about it okay here&amp;#39;s the diagram here we</text>
  <text start="256.729" dur="2.611">have the Black team against the white</text>
  <text start="257.9" dur="3.78">team and we&amp;#39;re gonna highlight mostly</text>
  <text start="259.34" dur="4.379">here where you can see my cursor this is</text>
  <text start="261.68" dur="3.329">the white king the white King is exposed</text>
  <text start="263.719" dur="4.711">there are no pawns in front of it there</text>
  <text start="265.009" dur="4.851">are no pieces on the side now what this</text>
  <text start="268.43" dur="3.84">website is trying to show you is that</text>
  <text start="269.86" dur="6.07">it&amp;#39;s not really important what</text>
  <text start="272.27" dur="6.15">cases aren&amp;#39;t here excuse me it shows</text>
  <text start="275.93" dur="5.07">that the king is exposed so let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="278.42" dur="5.91">say you know for hyperbole there can be</text>
  <text start="281" dur="4.26">any arrangement of pieces here once a</text>
  <text start="284.33" dur="2.67">once a game</text>
  <text start="285.26" dur="3.75">the king is allowed to make a move</text>
  <text start="287" dur="4.59">called castling in which they will take</text>
  <text start="289.01" dur="5.97">in their position and exchange it with</text>
  <text start="291.59" dur="5.37">the rooks in the middle now what needs</text>
  <text start="294.98" dur="4.95">to be happening here is there can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="296.96" dur="5.67">any pieces in between on this side we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="299.93" dur="4.17">on that side you cannot you will not be</text>
  <text start="302.63" dur="3.84">able to execute this move with peace in</text>
  <text start="304.1" dur="3.24">between so as you can see now they have</text>
  <text start="306.47" dur="3.03">met in the middle but they have</text>
  <text start="307.34" dur="5.28">exchanged sighs okay this allows the</text>
  <text start="309.5" dur="5.34">rook right here to protect the King in a</text>
  <text start="312.62" dur="4.38">defensive situation and sometimes it can</text>
  <text start="314.84" dur="3.87">be in this particular famous chess match</text>
  <text start="317" dur="3.6">that these people are referring to it</text>
  <text start="318.71" dur="3.72">was a very strategic move that want him</text>
  <text start="320.6" dur="4.11">to match here you can see that move</text>
  <text start="322.43" dur="3.99">being done on the other side now I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="324.71" dur="3.39">gonna go deep into that for the people</text>
  <text start="326.42" dur="2.88">that are talking about that when they</text>
  <text start="328.1" dur="6.72">refer to that if you want to know what</text>
  <text start="329.3" dur="8.4">castling is there you go okay now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="334.82" dur="4.38">in regards to the Keystone there have</text>
  <text start="337.7" dur="4.17">been a lot of people talking about the</text>
  <text start="339.2" dur="5.52">senior executive service the senior</text>
  <text start="341.87" dur="5.25">executive service SES is a position</text>
  <text start="344.72" dur="3">classification in the civil service keep</text>
  <text start="347.12" dur="2.64">that in mind</text>
  <text start="347.72" dur="4.92">civil service of the United States</text>
  <text start="349.76" dur="5.64">federal government somewhat analogous to</text>
  <text start="352.64" dur="5.64">general officer or flag officer ranks in</text>
  <text start="355.4" dur="5.7">the US Armed Forces it was created in</text>
  <text start="358.28" dur="5.76">1979 when the Civil Service Reform Act</text>
  <text start="361.1" dur="5.1">of 1978 went into effect under President</text>
  <text start="364.04" dur="3.75">Jimmy Carter now I don&amp;#39;t want to get</text>
  <text start="366.2" dur="4.77">much into that but there&amp;#39;s a lot to be</text>
  <text start="367.79" dur="5.64">said in the service reform Act of 1978 a</text>
  <text start="370.97" dur="4.2">lot of important details keep in mind</text>
  <text start="373.43" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s a civil service but it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="375.17" dur="5.73">like being an officer which is already</text>
  <text start="377.42" dur="5.97">interesting in itself their logo is the</text>
  <text start="380.9" dur="4.44">Keystone and this is a keystone what is</text>
  <text start="383.39" dur="2.82">a keystone well I&amp;#39;m not gonna show you a</text>
  <text start="385.34" dur="4.56">bunch of links or anything I&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="386.21" dur="6.93">kind of give you the Keystone for</text>
  <text start="389.9" dur="5.19">dummies quick version I guess but</text>
  <text start="393.14" dur="6.57">essentially this was goes back to my</text>
  <text start="395.09" dur="5.7">Sonics the Masons in when they were when</text>
  <text start="399.71" dur="2.82">they were building buildings and they</text>
  <text start="400.79" dur="2.91">wanted to build arches as opposed to</text>
  <text start="402.53" dur="2.64">just regular old doorway</text>
  <text start="403.7" dur="3.66">wasn&amp;#39;t it was beautiful when I was sort</text>
  <text start="405.17" dur="4.92">of a trade secret and this Keystone was</text>
  <text start="407.36" dur="4.65">sort of the key to that and it&amp;#39;s sort of</text>
  <text start="410.09" dur="4.17">become a metaphor for a lot of things</text>
  <text start="412.01" dur="4.68">but this is the piece that holds the</text>
  <text start="414.26" dur="4.29">archway together and the brilliance of</text>
  <text start="416.69" dur="3.39">it is that when it sits in it actually</text>
  <text start="418.55" dur="5.34">creates more pressure making it an</text>
  <text start="420.08" dur="5.49">incredibly strong structure so there you</text>
  <text start="423.89" dur="5.01">have it there&amp;#39;s the the Keystone the</text>
  <text start="425.57" dur="5.1">reason I&amp;#39;m not going to go into this SES</text>
  <text start="428.9" dur="3.51">theory is because already so many other</text>
  <text start="430.67" dur="3.99">channels have done that and I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="432.41" dur="3.75">important to just let them you know</text>
  <text start="434.66" dur="3.99">explain it better than I I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="436.16" dur="3.99">offering up some different ideas ok ok</text>
  <text start="438.65" dur="3.99">so don&amp;#39;t assume that I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="440.15" dur="3.66">anything about this or anything I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="442.64" dur="3.18">letting you know that this is one</text>
  <text start="443.81" dur="3.9">direction if you choose to take it ok</text>
