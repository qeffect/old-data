  <text start="520.44" dur="4.56">the money goes like I said probably one</text>
  <text start="522.209" dur="5.641">of our sources lackeys percentage to</text>
  <text start="525" dur="6.29">original mandate what&amp;#39;s the salary of a</text>
  <text start="527.85" dur="5.7">u.s. senator or US congressman or woman</text>
  <text start="531.29" dur="5.68">I&amp;#39;m not exactly sure what it is I think</text>
  <text start="533.55" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s right around 175,000 dollars give</text>
  <text start="536.97" dur="3.72">or take there&amp;#39;s probably some per diems</text>
  <text start="538.62" dur="5.4">and whatnot but we get the idea it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="540.69" dur="5.28">millions salary of a US president it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.02" dur="3.36">about four hundred thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="545.97" dur="3.179">again there&amp;#39;s a lot of per diem there</text>
  <text start="547.38" dur="4.26">I&amp;#39;m not exactly sure of the exact number</text>
  <text start="549.149" dur="4.291">but I think we understand here the fact</text>
  <text start="551.64" dur="3.78">of the matter is is that if you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="553.44" dur="3.839">to become a senator a congresswoman or</text>
  <text start="555.42" dur="4.229">US president or vice president you</text>
  <text start="557.279" dur="4.381">really aren&amp;#39;t doing this for the money</text>
  <text start="559.649" dur="3.571">but sadly that&amp;#39;s what it ended up coming</text>
