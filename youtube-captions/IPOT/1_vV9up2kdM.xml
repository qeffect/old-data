  <text start="78.49" dur="4.95">since Epstein was arrested weeks ago</text>

  <text start="163.33" dur="4.2">friendly very lovely and that Maxwell</text>

  <text start="173.62" dur="3.93">that the other shot it looked like she</text>
  <text start="175.81" dur="3.54">was wearing glasses and of course it</text>
  <text start="177.55" dur="4.14">didn&amp;#39;t look so Photoshop he she looks</text>
  <text start="179.35" dur="5.52">all clean and up and ready to go on this</text>
  <text start="181.69" dur="4.829">picture right here huh okay so the Daily</text>
  <text start="184.87" dur="3.6">Mail says they visited the in and out on</text>
  <text start="186.519" dur="4.621">Friday its reporters found that the</text>
  <text start="188.47" dur="5.46">advertisement posted behind Maxwell on a</text>
  <text start="191.14" dur="4.59">bus stop was for a local hospital but</text>
  <text start="193.93" dur="5.25">the New York Post photos show a poster</text>
  <text start="195.73" dur="5.91">for good boys the newly released rated-r</text>
  <text start="199.18" dur="4.09">movie where preteens make sex jokes in</text>
  <text start="201.64" dur="3.46">the same spot</text>
  <text start="203.27" dur="4.2">front media the advertising agency that</text>
  <text start="205.1" dur="4.29">manages posters on that bus stop told</text>
  <text start="207.47" dur="5.13">the Daily Mail that the hospital poster</text>
  <text start="209.39" dur="5.49">had been there since July 28th Carly&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="212.6" dur="4.05">zip a representative for OUTFRONT media</text>
  <text start="214.88" dur="3.72">says she thinks the pictures were</text>
  <text start="216.65" dur="4.11">doctored we think the poster in the</text>
  <text start="218.6" dur="4.17">Maxwell picture was photoshopped in zip</text>
  <text start="220.76" dur="4.47">told the Daily Mail we checked and we</text>
  <text start="222.77" dur="5.4">have no evidence or record of good boys</text>
  <text start="225.23" dur="4.53">ever being there the diner who took the</text>
  <text start="228.17" dur="3.42">photo also seems to have used a</text>
  <text start="229.76" dur="3.81">sophisticated camera lens according to</text>
  <text start="231.59" dur="3.99">the Daily Mail rather than a smartphone</text>
  <text start="233.57" dur="3.78">camera it raises the possibility that</text>
  <text start="235.58" dur="3.78">the photo was taken by a professional</text>
  <text start="237.35" dur="5.28">photographer rather than a regular diner</text>
  <text start="239.36" dur="5.61">who incidentally recognized max well as</text>
  <text start="242.63" dur="4.23">the post claimed and here is the picture</text>
  <text start="244.97" dur="4.38">in question as you can see front and</text>
  <text start="246.86" dur="4.65">center is Lady Gita doll with the home</text>
  <text start="249.35" dur="3.57">and gardens pose right there and she</text>
  <text start="251.51" dur="2.97">looks a little bit photoshopped and this</text>
  <text start="252.92" dur="3.6">is coming from somebody who spends a</text>
  <text start="254.48" dur="3.93">little time on Photoshop pretty much</text>
  <text start="256.52" dur="3.57">every day I could tell you right away</text>
  <text start="258.41" dur="3.23">this is definitely cleaned up a little</text>
  <text start="260.09" dur="5.13">bit especially around her cheeks and</text>
  <text start="261.64" dur="5.29">around her eyes but as you can see she</text>
  <text start="265.22" dur="3.24">is reading it hardback book and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="266.93" dur="2.76">gonna talk we talked a little bit about</text>
  <text start="268.46" dur="2.46">it in the last video but we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="269.69" dur="3.27">talk a little bit more about this book</text>
  <text start="270.92" dur="3.99">too but I want you to remember eyes that</text>
  <text start="272.96" dur="3.45">she is reading what looks to be a</text>
  <text start="274.91" dur="2.76">hardback could be a paperback but it</text>
  <text start="276.41" dur="3.48">looks right there like that part is the</text>
  <text start="277.67" dur="4.35">heart back there so either way but she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="279.89" dur="3.24">got two drinks there which suggested</text>
  <text start="282.02" dur="3.45">there could be another person now</text>
  <text start="283.13" dur="4.77">whether this is a phone or I&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="285.47" dur="3.6">toss in there I&amp;#39;m not sure it&amp;#39;s been too</text>
  <text start="287.9" dur="2.82">long since I&amp;#39;ve been back to the states</text>
  <text start="289.07" dur="3.21">to see what the Kindles look like now I</text>
  <text start="290.72" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t know if Kindles are that size</text>
  <text start="292.28" dur="3.93">anymore but that would look like either</text>
  <text start="294.56" dur="3.03">just a large cell phone either way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="296.21" dur="4.53">a pretty big phone and it doesn&amp;#39;t fit in</text>
  <text start="297.59" dur="4.44">my pocket but the drink right here is a</text>
  <text start="300.74" dur="4.53">soft drink and of course here is your</text>
  <text start="302.03" dur="5.31">alfresco shake right there anyway</text>
  <text start="305.27" dur="4.44">back here in the right corner is what</text>
  <text start="307.34" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;re talking about this this bus</text>
  <text start="309.71" dur="3.99">station right is the bus stop you can</text>
  <text start="311.99" dur="3.929">see there&amp;#39;s a movie poster for good boys</text>
  <text start="313.7" dur="4.35">which is a new movie coming out which is</text>
  <text start="315.919" dur="3">also a little little bit suspect that is</text>
  <text start="318.05" dur="2.4">a different story</text>
  <text start="318.919" dur="3.901">but that is what they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="320.45" dur="5.31">you have good boys right next to the in</text>
  <text start="322.82" dur="4.83">and outside now if you look over here in</text>
  <text start="325.76" dur="3.72">this other pic this is a pic that</text>
  <text start="327.65" dur="3.15">someone else took right around the same</text>
  <text start="329.48" dur="2.88">time this would have been after the pics</text>
  <text start="330.8" dur="4.35">we don&amp;#39;t really know when the get long</text>
  <text start="332.36" dur="3.99">pic was but you can see clearly that</text>
  <text start="335.15" dur="3.51">right where</text>
  <text start="336.35" dur="4.2">the in and outside is at that same bus</text>
  <text start="338.66" dur="3.42">stop we have now the advertisement for</text>
  <text start="340.55" dur="4.16">the emergency room like they were</text>
  <text start="342.08" dur="5.55">talking about so that is quite a</text>
  <text start="344.71" dur="5.2">discrepancy now a quick little bit about</text>
  <text start="347.63" dur="6.6">OUTFRONT media who owns these billboards</text>
  <text start="349.91" dur="6.6">on December 7th 1999 outdoor systems OSI</text>

  <text start="372.2" dur="7.47">became CBS Outdoor which is CBS alfresco</text>
  <text start="375.61" dur="7.09">cbs-owned CBS Outdoor as division of CBS</text>

  <text start="382.7" dur="3.27">spun off into an independent company you</text>
  <text start="384.56" dur="4.5">following all this me neither</text>
  <text start="385.97" dur="5.4">CBS Corporation continued to own 83% of</text>
  <text start="389.06" dur="3.93">OUTFRONT media although this number is</text>
  <text start="391.37" dur="3.42">expected to decline over time as</text>
  <text start="392.99" dur="5.34">OUTFRONT media converts into a real</text>

  <text start="408.41" dur="2.79">28 2014</text>
  <text start="409.76" dur="3.09">all right fair enough so it looks like</text>
  <text start="411.2" dur="4.14">there&amp;#39;s still kind of part of CBS they</text>
  <text start="412.85" dur="3.21">just sort of renamed it right all right</text>
  <text start="415.34" dur="2.52">fair enough</text>
  <text start="416.06" dur="4.35">and lo and behold we get another picture</text>
  <text start="417.86" dur="4.59">emerging from the depths of Reddit</text>
  <text start="420.41" dur="3.99">there&amp;#39;s Kiel all right they&amp;#39;re reading a</text>
  <text start="422.45" dur="4.59">book with her alfresco shake it or</text>
  <text start="424.4" dur="6.54">drinking her burger and oh my goodness</text>
  <text start="427.04" dur="7.02">is that a dog with her no so now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="430.94" dur="4.8">got good boy and a dog well you know</text>
  <text start="434.06" dur="4.53">what that means ladies and gentlemen and</text>
  <text start="435.74" dur="5.1">if you don&amp;#39;t then I will remember eyes</text>
  <text start="438.59" dur="3.75">you with an entire series of videos that</text>
  <text start="440.84" dur="3.9">I&amp;#39;ve barely been doing there&amp;#39;s quite a</text>
  <text start="442.34" dur="3.87">few of them but I would have to you know</text>
  <text start="444.74" dur="2.97">I&amp;#39;m just gonna flash these up on the</text>
  <text start="446.21" dur="3.36">screen and if you want to go find them</text>
  <text start="447.71" dur="3.63">you can use these and just take a</text>
  <text start="449.57" dur="3.42">screenshot or whatever and go search</text>
  <text start="451.34" dur="5.79">some of these videos but it all goes</text>
  <text start="452.99" dur="6.89">back to a video entitled very good boy I</text>
  <text start="457.13" dur="7.289">have another one called dog-eat-dog</text>
  <text start="459.88" dur="7.63">burnin for Burma the dogged pursuit and</text>
  <text start="464.419" dur="4.631">of course try the gumbo parts one and</text>
  <text start="467.51" dur="3.909">gear</text>
  <text start="469.05" dur="3.989">and then we have every dog knows its own</text>
  <text start="471.419" dur="5.641">those are just a few of the videos that</text>
  <text start="473.039" dur="6.84">I have done on a ton of very good boy</text>
  <text start="477.06" dur="4.8">dog tweets so this seems to be leading</text>
  <text start="479.879" dur="3.871">somewhere and this is something that I</text>
  <text start="481.86" dur="3.179">pointed out months ago and a lot of</text>
  <text start="483.75" dur="3.419">people thought I was really crazy and</text>
  <text start="485.039" dur="3.09">now I&amp;#39;m starting to think that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="487.169" dur="3.18">probably right</text>
  <text start="488.129" dur="4.171">either way looks pretty creepy and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="490.349" dur="3.81">got ourselves a Doge I also want to</text>
  <text start="492.3" dur="3.39">point out too that behind her in this</text>
  <text start="494.159" dur="3.901">picture you have the word it looks like</text>
  <text start="495.69" dur="3.9">a used car a lot back there you have the</text>
  <text start="498.06" dur="3.509">word trade and I&amp;#39;m not really sure if</text>
  <text start="499.59" dur="3.379">that was meant to be that way but it</text>
  <text start="501.569" dur="4.261">seems like these pictures were being</text>
  <text start="502.969" dur="6.521">purposely released now let me point out</text>
  <text start="505.83" dur="6.54">one more thing here about lady ghee I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="509.49" dur="5.909">not exactly sure how or why this was</text>
  <text start="512.37" dur="4.979">done but I&amp;#39;m smelling some Photoshop</text>
  <text start="515.399" dur="4.591">right here if you&amp;#39;ll notice over her</text>
  <text start="517.349" dur="4.23">shoulder right here you will see what</text>
  <text start="519.99" dur="4.26">looks to be a break like they were doing</text>
  <text start="521.579" dur="4.771">some erasing or something seems to be</text>
  <text start="524.25" dur="4.14">altered here but it&amp;#39;s done a little</text>
  <text start="526.35" dur="3.6">hastily and a little sloppily and I know</text>
  <text start="528.39" dur="3.66">this because I do it hastily and</text>
  <text start="529.95" dur="4.259">sloppily all the time myself and this is</text>
  <text start="532.05" dur="3.12">the kind of result that I get it looks</text>
  <text start="534.209" dur="3.811">like she had a different background</text>
  <text start="535.17" dur="5.46">there and it was slightly cut there let</text>
  <text start="538.02" dur="5.759">me just bring it in a little bit closer</text>
  <text start="540.63" dur="5.07">for you there you go do you see how it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="543.779" dur="3.451">over the shoulder like there you see a</text>
  <text start="545.7" dur="2.97">difference there we&amp;#39;ll take it all the</text>
  <text start="547.23" dur="3.96">way down it seems to be pretty</text>
  <text start="548.67" dur="5.909">consistent and it even looks like they</text>
  <text start="551.19" dur="6.99">got a chunk out of the bench here so</text>
  <text start="554.579" dur="6.301">this looks like a sub photo shopping</text>
  <text start="558.18" dur="5.49">also you&amp;#39;ll notice that the brick</text>
  <text start="560.88" dur="4.59">pattern over here and the brick pattern</text>
  <text start="563.67" dur="3.21">over here are completely different and</text>
  <text start="565.47" dur="3.989">I&amp;#39;m not sure why they would need to do</text>
  <text start="566.88" dur="3.57">that for such a basic little wall but it</text>
  <text start="569.459" dur="3.75">definitely looks like there was a</text>
  <text start="570.45" dur="4.62">different background behind lady Gaeta</text>
  <text start="573.209" dur="3.661">da and here you see in this picture</text>
  <text start="575.07" dur="3.69">again it would have been over here on</text>
  <text start="576.87" dur="4.02">the left side over this shoulder the</text>
  <text start="578.76" dur="4.439">brick pattern just isn&amp;#39;t consistent with</text>
  <text start="580.89" dur="3.96">what we saw over her shoulder so my</text>
  <text start="583.199" dur="3.121">guess is that she may never have been</text>
  <text start="584.85" dur="3.66">here in the first place and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="586.32" dur="4.709">probably why she posed they could have</text>
  <text start="588.51" dur="5.34">posed her at any food court in any old</text>
  <text start="591.029" dur="3.961">in-and-out burger around the world and</text>
  <text start="593.85" dur="3.06">really we don&amp;#39;t even know when the</text>
