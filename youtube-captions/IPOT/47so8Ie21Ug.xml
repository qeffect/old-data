  <text start="313.94" dur="5.37">states can sort of vote to veto this but</text>
  <text start="317.57" dur="3.93">this is a really really big mess and</text>
  <text start="319.31" dur="4.83">there&amp;#39;s a big mess just within these</text>
  <text start="321.5" dur="4.17">groups right here now I would suggest if</text>
  <text start="324.14" dur="3.24">you&amp;#39;re familiar with any of these groups</text>
  <text start="325.67" dur="3.03">that you get people familiar with these</text>

  <text start="330.32" dur="5.37">if you watch my weathermen I believe it</text>
  <text start="332.81" dur="4.53">was my weathermen 2 video I mentioned</text>
  <text start="335.69" dur="3.72">the US Conference of Catholic Bishops</text>
  <text start="337.34" dur="4.29">this is wrapped up with the Clinton</text>
  <text start="339.41" dur="5.24">Foundation and a lot of human</text>
  <text start="341.63" dur="6.15">trafficking including Angelina Jolie&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="344.65" dur="5.29">group which is scaping my mind right now</text>
  <text start="347.78" dur="3.66">kind kids in need of defense I think</text>
  <text start="349.94" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s what it is kids in need of legal</text>
  <text start="351.44" dur="5.22">defense but anyway this is has a lot of</text>
  <text start="354.41" dur="4.29">connections to human trafficking so</text>
  <text start="356.66" dur="4.5">these are very very suspect and if you</text>
  <text start="358.7" dur="4.53">will remember that it was a group very</text>
  <text start="361.16" dur="4.35">much like this that got busted in Haiti</text>
  <text start="363.23" dur="3.75">some years ago with Laura Silsbee which</text>
  <text start="365.51" dur="3.72">was the whole thing that kicked off the</text>
  <text start="366.98" dur="4.38">entire pizza gate conspiracy with</text>
  <text start="369.23" dur="3.54">Hillary Clinton her foundation out there</text>
  <text start="371.36" dur="3.33">in Haiti and whatnot so this is all</text>
  <text start="372.77" dur="3.81">going down in the US and of course this</text>
  <text start="374.69" dur="4.62">is all happening just in time for</text>
  <text start="376.58" dur="4.2">elections you get the idea right ok so I</text>
  <text start="379.31" dur="2.79">think we all understand the danger of</text>
  <text start="380.78" dur="2.52">this right and I think we understand</text>
  <text start="382.1" dur="3.21">that the Democrats have been doing this</text>
  <text start="383.3" dur="3.87">for years flooding the borders full of</text>
  <text start="385.31" dur="4.29">it legal immigrants hoping that they</text>
  <text start="387.17" dur="4.17">will in turn vote Democrat for them and</text>
  <text start="389.6" dur="3.69">keep them in power doesn&amp;#39;t really matter</text>
  <text start="391.34" dur="3.87">how they do it and of course we have</text>
  <text start="393.29" dur="4.35">some districts that are vetoing this</text>
  <text start="395.21" dur="4.41">which just causes a redistribution of</text>
  <text start="397.64" dur="4.23">immigrants but what this is leading to</text>
  <text start="399.62" dur="4.02">now is a redistribution of congressional</text>
  <text start="401.87" dur="3.63">seats and that could be really really</text>
  <text start="403.64" dur="3.9">dangerous for the long-term democratic</text>
  <text start="405.5" dur="3.57">process of our republic but let me turn</text>
  <text start="407.54" dur="3.81">you on to this case because I think this</text>
  <text start="409.07" dur="4.26">is relevant this is the United States</text>

  <text start="624.71" dur="3.51">she knew what was wrong she did it</text>
  <text start="626.75" dur="2.25">anyway because she was making a ton of</text>
  <text start="628.22" dur="2.85">coin</text>
  <text start="629" dur="3.81">okay so slowly the big picture starts to</text>
  <text start="631.07" dur="3.48">come a little bit more clear right why</text>
  <text start="632.81" dur="3.72">the Democrats want to flood the US with</text>
  <text start="634.55" dur="4.86">illegal immigrants well short term they</text>

  <text start="639.41" dur="3.51">it&amp;#39;s not just another four-year election</text>
  <text start="641.03" dur="4.23">this is about shifting congressional</text>

  <text start="645.26" dur="4.62">democratic process right keep in mind</text>
  <text start="647.81" dur="4.46">this case then I just talked about here</text>
  <text start="649.88" dur="4.71">what&amp;#39;s going to be heard in February</text>
  <text start="652.27" dur="5.53">2020 well I&amp;#39;m sure Democrats would love</text>
  <text start="654.59" dur="5.01">to impeach by then right because if they</text>
  <text start="657.8" dur="3.45">impeach they could probably shift a lot</text>
  <text start="659.6" dur="4.68">of other things and that may even affect</text>
  <text start="661.25" dur="5.31">the outcome of this Supreme Court case</text>
  <text start="664.28" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;s going to be a very important case</text>
  <text start="666.56" dur="3.84">that they&amp;#39;re going to be hearing oral</text>

  <text start="670.4" dur="4.77">3742 why is Pelosi holding the two</text>
  <text start="673.01" dur="4.05">articles of impeachment yeah they really</text>
  <text start="675.17" dur="3.24">have something they really think it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="677.06" dur="2.85">strong case they should be able to push</text>
  <text start="678.41" dur="3">it through and it would have its own</text>

  <text start="696.7" dur="6.87">drag through till say February 2020</text>
  <text start="700.39" dur="5.28">right now if this case gets upheld this</text>
  <text start="703.57" dur="3.87">person will not only do time but I would</text>
  <text start="705.67" dur="4.229">imagine a lot of restitution a lot of</text>
  <text start="707.44" dur="4.56">money being paid back to taxpayers but</text>
  <text start="709.899" dur="3.961">what this also does is it sets a</text>
  <text start="712" dur="4.11">precedent for anyone else who&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="713.86" dur="4.68">guilty of this and this could be a real</text>

  <text start="718.54" dur="3.6">we know that there are a lot of</text>

  <text start="722.14" dur="5.85">pulling this very same thing so it sets</text>
  <text start="725.11" dur="4.83">a precedent for them to so it seems to</text>
  <text start="727.99" dur="4.14">me like they may be very afraid of the</text>
  <text start="729.94" dur="3.54">outcome of this case and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="732.13" dur="4.05">sitting on these articles of impeachment</text>
  <text start="733.48" dur="4.91">just so that the narrative will stay out</text>
  <text start="736.18" dur="4.05">there and hopefully they&amp;#39;ll be able to</text>
  <text start="738.39" dur="3.55">whether they&amp;#39;re going to blackmail</text>
  <text start="740.23" dur="3.72">somebody or whatever hopefully they&amp;#39;ll</text>

  <text start="749.77" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s going to happen and we talked about</text>
  <text start="751.39" dur="3.21">yesterday about them trying to get some</text>
  <text start="753.25" dur="2.67">of the information from grand jury</text>
  <text start="754.6" dur="3.75">material and stuff like that</text>
  <text start="755.92" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s another aspect of it but I do</text>
  <text start="758.35" dur="3.989">think this case has a lot of bearing on</text>
  <text start="760.48" dur="4.53">this because like I said it sets a major</text>
  <text start="762.339" dur="4.951">precedent this gets upheld then of</text>
  <text start="765.01" dur="4.29">course this is going to put a lot of</text>
  <text start="767.29" dur="4.29">them under the gun and it could lead to</text>
  <text start="769.3" dur="4.289">more arrests and it could really destroy</text>
  <text start="771.58" dur="3.99">the Democratic Party but more</text>
  <text start="773.589" dur="4.291">importantly for them the democratic</text>
  <text start="775.57" dur="4.47">process moving forward that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="777.88" dur="4.44">really want to dismantle right and of</text>
  <text start="780.04" dur="3.96">course if this gets overturned and it</text>
  <text start="782.32" dur="2.76">maintains overturned then of course this</text>
  <text start="784" dur="3.81">person gets off the hook</text>
  <text start="785.08" dur="4.56">and any Democrat moving forward also</text>
  <text start="787.81" dur="3.899">gets off the hook so I think this is a</text>
  <text start="789.64" dur="3.81">big case I think this is a bigger part</text>
  <text start="791.709" dur="3.421">of why the Democrats are wanting to</text>
  <text start="793.45" dur="4.44">flood the borders and I think this is</text>
  <text start="795.13" dur="4.44">also another aspect of why Pelosi is</text>
  <text start="797.89" dur="3.36">withholding these articles of</text>
