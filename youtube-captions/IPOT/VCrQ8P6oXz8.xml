  <text start="404.93" dur="6.35">of this year but also Minnesota rough</text>
  <text start="408.59" dur="9.72">day for Lakefield dogs that called 9-1-1</text>
  <text start="411.28" dur="9.46">16 times you must have been a rough</text>
  <text start="418.31" dur="5.55">morning for a duo of dogs in Lakeville</text>

  <text start="433.85" dur="4.14">cuz their dogs and their paws alright so</text>
  <text start="436.22" dur="4.86">like I said this is an older story from</text>
  <text start="437.99" dur="4.59">February but these dogs ended up calling</text>
  <text start="441.08" dur="4.92">on 9-1-1</text>
  <text start="442.58" dur="5.82">16 times seems very curious right and</text>
  <text start="446" dur="4.77">they ended up going up inside the house</text>
  <text start="448.4" dur="4.26">and figuring it out here he says the</text>
  <text start="450.77" dur="3.99">officer says went upstairs to his office</text>
  <text start="452.66" dur="4.8">where the cell phone was it was on his</text>
  <text start="454.76" dur="4.8">desk it was on emergency call only so in</text>
  <text start="457.46" dur="4.829">theory a dog could have called 911 and</text>
  <text start="459.56" dur="5.1">pushed the phone with its paw okay so</text>
  <text start="462.289" dur="4.471">these then if this story is indeed true</text>
  <text start="464.66" dur="4.92">these dogs went up to the desk and</text>

  <text start="469.58" dur="5.04">here&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s curious Remi and bomber</text>

  <text start="496.97" dur="3.87">face probably is very true I found it</text>
  <text start="498.71" dur="4.76">very strange I also found it very</text>
  <text start="500.84" dur="6.21">strange that bomber here has a red</text>

  <text start="880.51" dur="3.3">this is serious stuff and I know I get a</text>
  <text start="882.55" dur="2.64">lot of people saying Patrick don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="883.81" dur="4.47">underestimate the power of this stuff I</text>
  <text start="885.19" dur="4.77">get it I really do but if the at the end</text>
  <text start="888.28" dur="4.05">of a day I want to point out it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="889.96" dur="4.47">effectivity has been about as effective</text>
  <text start="892.33" dur="4.41">as it was back then when they were doing</text>
  <text start="894.43" dur="4.89">this stuff during the Kavanagh thing and</text>
  <text start="896.74" dur="4.56">right after Trump&amp;#39;s inauguration it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="899.32" dur="4.17">very little it&amp;#39;s a desperation move and</text>
  <text start="901.3" dur="4.26">of course it&amp;#39;s a bit of a puff piece I</text>
  <text start="903.49" dur="3.72">think but I wanted to point it out there</text>
  <text start="905.56" dur="4.68">are definitely evil forces at work but</text>
  <text start="907.21" dur="5.88">this just goes to show how deranged and</text>
  <text start="910.24" dur="4.89">unhinge the left is kind of becoming at</text>
  <text start="913.09" dur="4.71">this point and I think a lot of sensible</text>
  <text start="915.13" dur="4.89">Democrats or classic liberals are really</text>
  <text start="917.8" dur="3.48">really looking for some sort of</text>
  <text start="920.02" dur="2.249">alternative at this point they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="921.28" dur="2.909">starting to see</text>
  <text start="922.269" dur="5.341">the ridiculous nature of this which</text>
  <text start="924.189" dur="11.58">leads us to our next story we got</text>
  <text start="927.61" dur="9.81">ourselves a little catfight yeah and it</text>
  <text start="935.769" dur="4.8">all started with Hillary Clinton going</text>
  <text start="937.42" dur="5.279">after Tulsi Gabbard like this I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="940.569" dur="3.421">making any predictions but I think</text>
  <text start="942.699" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;ve got their eye on somebody who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="943.99" dur="4.349">currently in the Democratic primary and</text>
  <text start="946.149" dur="3.99">are grooming her to be the third party</text>
  <text start="948.339" dur="5.28">candidate she&amp;#39;s a favorite of the</text>
  <text start="950.139" dur="6.69">Russians they have a bunch of sites and</text>
  <text start="953.619" dur="8.58">BOTS and other ways of supporting her so</text>
  <text start="956.829" dur="7.831">far whoa tell us how you feel Hillary</text>
  <text start="962.199" dur="4.531">well Tulsi also has a few things on her</text>
  <text start="964.66" dur="5.099">mind after all she&amp;#39;s been blessed with</text>
  <text start="966.73" dur="5.539">the gift of Gabbard she says great Thank</text>
  <text start="969.759" dur="5.81">You Hillary Clinton you the queen of</text>
  <text start="972.269" dur="5.531">warmongers embodiment of corruption and</text>
  <text start="975.569" dur="4.39">personification of the rot that is</text>
  <text start="977.8" dur="4.56">sickened the Democratic Party for so</text>
  <text start="979.959" dur="5.25">long and finally come out from behind</text>
  <text start="982.36" dur="4.949">the curtain from the day I announced my</text>
  <text start="985.209" dur="5.521">candidacy there has been a concerted</text>
  <text start="987.309" dur="6.361">campaign to destroy my reputation we</text>
  <text start="990.73" dur="6.479">wondered who was behind it and why now</text>
  <text start="993.67" dur="5.969">we know it was always you through your</text>
  <text start="997.209" dur="4.951">proxies and powerful allies and the</text>
  <text start="999.639" dur="5.341">corporate media and war machine afraid</text>
  <text start="1002.16" dur="6.229">of the threat I posed it&amp;#39;s now clear</text>
  <text start="1004.98" dur="6.269">that this primary is between you and me</text>
  <text start="1008.389" dur="10.38">don&amp;#39;t cowardly hide behind your proxies</text>
  <text start="1011.249" dur="7.52">join the race directly he wants you to</text>
  <text start="1021.66" dur="6.88">all righty then so a couple interesting</text>
  <text start="1026.829" dur="4.351">talking points here that I want to talk</text>
  <text start="1028.54" dur="4.02">about first and foremost we see Gabbard</text>
  <text start="1031.18" dur="4.56">calling out Clinton essentially</text>
  <text start="1032.56" dur="6.18">challenging her to run now if this</text>
  <text start="1035.74" dur="5.219">outrages you I highly suggest that we</text>
  <text start="1038.74" dur="3.78">just take a little step back as to why</text>
  <text start="1040.959" dur="4.081">this is probably possible in the first</text>
  <text start="1042.52" dur="4.26">place but I think I&amp;#39;ve been saying it on</text>
  <text start="1045.04" dur="4.2">this channel for quite some time I think</text>
  <text start="1046.78" dur="5.76">at the very least Clinton is going to</text>
  <text start="1049.24" dur="6.33">test the waters to see if she can run</text>
  <text start="1052.54" dur="5.7">again but this is likely defensive in</text>
  <text start="1055.57" dur="4.38">posture after all with things that might</text>
  <text start="1058.24" dur="4.02">be coming to light very very soon</text>
  <text start="1059.95" dur="4.41">Hillary is going to find herself on the</text>
  <text start="1062.26" dur="4.38">defensive once again we just had this</text>
  <text start="1064.36" dur="4.7">State Department report come out in</text>
  <text start="1066.64" dur="6">regards to the emails they were able to</text>
  <text start="1069.06" dur="5.41">to go through and they found about quite</text>
  <text start="1072.64" dur="3.9">a few different security security</text>
  <text start="1074.47" dur="4.47">violations involving about 38 different</text>
  <text start="1076.54" dur="4.32">people now that&amp;#39;s being reported in</text>
  <text start="1078.94" dur="3.48">conservative media meanwhile the</text>
  <text start="1080.86" dur="3.69">Washington Post and groups like that</text>
  <text start="1082.42" dur="3.06">they are saying the complete opposite</text>
  <text start="1084.55" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re saying that this is a</text>
  <text start="1085.48" dur="5.61">vindication of Hillary Clinton so like I</text>
  <text start="1089.05" dur="5.55">said this kind of seems to set the stage</text>
  <text start="1091.09" dur="7.11">for Hillary to possibly run at least</text>
  <text start="1094.6" dur="5.37">test the waters and her doing this is</text>
  <text start="1098.2" dur="4.35">likely to avoid some sort of political</text>
  <text start="1099.97" dur="4.23">persecution it&amp;#39;s easier to claim that</text>
  <text start="1102.55" dur="3.48">against somebody like a president Trump</text>
  <text start="1104.2" dur="3.45">if you&amp;#39;re running against him well</text>
  <text start="1106.03" dur="3.72">you&amp;#39;re just bringing up my emails cuz</text>
  <text start="1107.65" dur="4.5">you&amp;#39;re trying to you know go after me</text>
  <text start="1109.75" dur="4.47">politically rather than this being</text>
  <text start="1112.15" dur="4.05">having nothing to do with it which we</text>
  <text start="1114.22" dur="3.6">know that this really has to do with the</text>
  <text start="1116.2" dur="4.61">crime itself not the fact that she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1117.82" dur="6.3">running are you following me so far now</text>
  <text start="1120.81" dur="5.56">we&amp;#39;ve got this Tulsi Gabbard who is a</text>
  <text start="1124.12" dur="4.29">very very interesting character and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1126.37" dur="3.87">not really ready to make any decisions</text>
  <text start="1128.41" dur="4.29">on this I just want to kind of propose a</text>
  <text start="1130.24" dur="5.37">few different things here first of all</text>
  <text start="1132.7" dur="5.88">she checks a lot of boxes young female</text>

  <text start="1142.42" dur="4.83">she checks a lot of boxes and the reason</text>
  <text start="1145.54" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s important is because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1147.25" dur="5.16">difficult for people on the left to</text>
  <text start="1150.25" dur="3.929">truly hate her because a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1152.41" dur="4.17">on the Left don&amp;#39;t particularly like him</text>
  <text start="1154.179" dur="5.311">we Clinton and right now they truly are</text>
  <text start="1156.58" dur="5.099">struggling to find sort of this you know</text>
  <text start="1159.49" dur="4.319">this candidate to get behind everybody</text>
  <text start="1161.679" dur="4.47">right now it&amp;#39;s getting behind Bernie and</text>
  <text start="1163.809" dur="4.141">of course bernie is full-blown socialist</text>
  <text start="1166.149" dur="3.9">but the fact of the matter is that the</text>

  <text start="1187.96" dur="5.76">touch on Tulsi Gabbard that seems to be</text>
  <text start="1190.509" dur="5.311">the one that has the most intrigue now</text>
  <text start="1193.72" dur="4.5">we look over at conservative media and</text>
  <text start="1195.82" dur="4.439">you see that she&amp;#39;s on Tucker Tucker</text>
  <text start="1198.22" dur="3.899">Carlson over there on Fox every few days</text>
  <text start="1200.259" dur="4.17">now she&amp;#39;s become a bit of a media</text>
  <text start="1202.119" dur="3.93">darling to the right and I think this is</text>
  <text start="1204.429" dur="5.161">important to look at the balance here</text>
  <text start="1206.049" dur="6.061">and although she outwardly at least</text>
  <text start="1209.59" dur="4.829">comes off as more of a classic liberal</text>
  <text start="1212.11" dur="5.22">she&amp;#39;s been very hawkish on Trump too</text>
  <text start="1214.419" dur="5.911">however I want to point out the one</text>
  <text start="1217.33" dur="5.669">particular instance in which she&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1220.33" dur="5.579">very outspoken against Trump is oddly</text>
  <text start="1222.999" dur="4.65">enough Saudi Arabia now don&amp;#39;t get me</text>
  <text start="1225.909" dur="3.48">wrong on this all I want to point out</text>
  <text start="1227.649" dur="3.421">about that is that out of all the things</text>
  <text start="1229.389" dur="4.86">that you could probably criticize Trump</text>
  <text start="1231.07" dur="5.219">about that&amp;#39;s probably the most logical</text>
  <text start="1234.249" dur="3.991">one because you can cut you have a lot</text>
  <text start="1236.289" dur="4.14">to reference so she doesn&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="1238.24" dur="3.689">ridiculous for criticizing him about</text>
  <text start="1240.429" dur="3.031">Saudi Arabia now I don&amp;#39;t want to debate</text>
  <text start="1241.929" dur="4.59">about Saudi Arabia at least not right</text>
  <text start="1243.46" dur="5.039">now my point is is that she doesn&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="1246.519" dur="3.331">unhinged for doing so she&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1248.499" dur="3.12">complaining about Russia she&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1249.85" dur="2.699">complaining about Ukraine she&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="1251.619" dur="4.26">about something that you could actually</text>
  <text start="1252.549" dur="5.49">apply some logic to in Saudi Arabia now</text>
  <text start="1255.879" dur="5.37">I also want to remember eyes yeah that</text>
  <text start="1258.039" dur="5.01">back when Trump was president-elect she</text>
  <text start="1261.249" dur="4.741">interviewed with him about a possible</text>
  <text start="1263.049" dur="3.781">position so obviously she was willing to</text>
  <text start="1265.99" dur="2.97">work with him</text>
  <text start="1266.83" dur="4.169">president Trump seemed willing to work</text>
  <text start="1268.96" dur="4.38">with her I don&amp;#39;t really know how that</text>
  <text start="1270.999" dur="6.571">all turned out but they had a very</text>
  <text start="1273.34" dur="6.539">extensive meeting and now she&amp;#39;s causing</text>
  <text start="1277.57" dur="3.959">all this havoc and she&amp;#39;s got supporters</text>
  <text start="1279.879" dur="3.54">on both sides this is very very</text>
  <text start="1281.529" dur="3.681">interesting now we go back to what</text>
  <text start="1283.419" dur="3.35">Hillary said about her</text>
  <text start="1285.21" dur="3.299">I think she was completely wrong about</text>
  <text start="1286.769" dur="3.84">the Russia angle because of course</text>
  <text start="1288.509" dur="4.14">Hillary wants us to go Russia Russia</text>
  <text start="1290.609" dur="4.05">Russia we already know that and when we</text>
  <text start="1292.649" dur="4.051">understand that we know why Hillary says</text>
  <text start="1294.659" dur="4.2">that but I do think that Hillary was</text>
  <text start="1296.7" dur="4.319">right about one thing in the fact that</text>
  <text start="1298.859" dur="4.8">tulsi gabbard could very well be a</text>
  <text start="1301.019" dur="5.04">catalyst to running on a third-party</text>
  <text start="1303.659" dur="4.61">ticket it wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise me if a lot</text>
  <text start="1306.059" dur="5.04">of more classic liberals or Democrats</text>
  <text start="1308.269" dur="4.691">kind of tend to go with her this could</text>
  <text start="1311.099" dur="4.08">really really hurt the Democratic Party</text>
  <text start="1312.96" dur="4.649">in a new way and this is where I find</text>
  <text start="1315.179" dur="4.021">the story very intriguing now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1317.609" dur="3.211">want to go too much into Gabon at least</text>
  <text start="1319.2" dur="3.389">not right now because like I said I</text>
  <text start="1320.82" dur="3.359">haven&amp;#39;t completely formed my opinion on</text>
  <text start="1322.589" dur="3.121">her I know a lot of you guys have said</text>

  <text start="1330.599" dur="5.04">could very well be right I think she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1333.029" dur="4.921">got some odd connections to Assad I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1335.639" dur="4.561">not really sold on her either way but</text>
  <text start="1337.95" dur="4.349">the point I&amp;#39;m really trying to make is</text>
  <text start="1340.2" dur="4.469">it seems like she&amp;#39;s being properly</text>
  <text start="1342.299" dur="5.01">placed in the right place at the right</text>
  <text start="1344.669" dur="6.96">moment and that this fight was meant to</text>
  <text start="1347.309" dur="5.67">draw Hillary out into the light finally</text>

  <text start="1685.45" dur="4.919">trying to stifle this whole fast and</text>
  <text start="1687.279" dur="5.76">furious thing so I find the timing of it</text>
  <text start="1690.369" dur="4.89">very odd of this death carolyn maloney</text>
  <text start="1693.039" dur="3.661">who happens to be from new york home of</text>
  <text start="1695.259" dur="4.831">the giants</text>
  <text start="1696.7" dur="5.219">she takes over and i think we all know</text>
  <text start="1700.09" dur="4.02">kind of where her stance is with this</text>
  <text start="1701.919" dur="4.74">she wants to take our guns but she was</text>
  <text start="1704.11" dur="4.62">indeed involved in this operation choke</text>
  <text start="1706.659" dur="3.541">point which like I said again this</text>
  <text start="1708.73" dur="4.289">really threatened a lot of businesses</text>
  <text start="1710.2" dur="5.099">that were pro-gun so I&amp;#39;m not really sure</text>
  <text start="1713.019" dur="3.24">if that&amp;#39;s our connection there but this</text>
  <text start="1715.299" dur="3.84">carolyn maloney</text>
  <text start="1716.259" dur="4.5">is likely to be very much along the same</text>
  <text start="1719.139" dur="4.051">kind of lines it&amp;#39;s Elijah Cummings I</text>
  <text start="1720.759" dur="4.23">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if she kind of</text>
  <text start="1723.19" dur="3.329">leads the in peace impeachment charge</text>
  <text start="1724.989" dur="4.26">and becomes a new voice in regards to</text>
  <text start="1726.519" dur="5.071">that but either way it looks like we</text>
  <text start="1729.249" dur="4.17">lost ourselves a giant now let me leave</text>
  <text start="1731.59" dur="3.769">you with one last thing as you can see</text>
  <text start="1733.419" dur="5.64">I&amp;#39;m on the home page here of Maloney</text>
  <text start="1735.359" dur="6.01">house.gov the home of Carolyn B Maloney</text>

  <text start="1741.369" dur="4.201">up what I&amp;#39;m looking for there it shows</text>
  <text start="1742.929" dur="3.69">that my website encountered an error as</text>

  <text start="1746.619" dur="4.231">article I&amp;#39;ve seen on this at least as of</text>
  <text start="1749.019" dur="4.26">now others might pop up but at least as</text>
  <text start="1750.85" dur="4.019">of now I can&amp;#39;t seem to find this and the</text>
  <text start="1753.279" dur="4.74">reason I wanted to highlight this is</text>
