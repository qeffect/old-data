  <text start="363.6" dur="4.95">the bureau claimed it destroyed the file</text>
  <text start="365.13" dur="5.97">on May 1st 1997 considering the sour</text>
  <text start="368.55" dur="4.68">relations between the FBI and CIA during</text>
  <text start="371.1" dur="4.2">the Cold War it is likely that Armour</text>
  <text start="373.23" dur="4.11">Dunham was being monitored by FBI</text>
  <text start="375.3" dur="4.05">director J Edgar Hoover in the same</text>

  <text start="455.399" dur="3.33">so I will leave that report for you down</text>
  <text start="456.899" dur="3.87">below because it&amp;#39;s very very complex</text>
  <text start="458.729" dur="4.05">there&amp;#39;s a lot of different ideas here</text>
  <text start="460.769" dur="3.75">being thrown around and a lot of history</text>
  <text start="462.779" dur="4.62">here but it does seem like we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="464.519" dur="5.13">some CIA ties I want to switch gears and</text>
  <text start="467.399" dur="5.25">take you to this this is an article from</text>

  <text start="500.399" dur="3.36">on the fence with that but that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="502.139" dur="3.06">story for another day her earlier name</text>
  <text start="503.759" dur="3.51">was Stanley and so Torro</text>

  <text start="520.99" dur="3.78">most people are aware of the controversy</text>
  <text start="522.7" dur="4.889">over Obama&amp;#39;s birth certificate which was</text>
  <text start="524.77" dur="4.71">made public finally in 2011 according to</text>
  <text start="527.589" dur="4.021">computer experts has been proven</text>
  <text start="529.48" dur="3.81">positively to be a fake and I just want</text>
  <text start="531.61" dur="3.57">to stop right there I&amp;#39;ve actually done</text>
  <text start="533.29" dur="4.109">extensive research on this and I guess</text>
  <text start="535.18" dur="3.93">that&amp;#39;s why this is really hard to report</text>
  <text start="537.399" dur="4.201">on a Q post cuz it really needs its own</text>
  <text start="539.11" dur="4.59">documentary but I would just point out</text>
  <text start="541.6" dur="3.81">and you&amp;#39;ve probably seen this before if</text>
  <text start="543.7" dur="4.32">you take Obama&amp;#39;s birth certificate and</text>
  <text start="545.41" dur="4.799">dump it into a photo editing program the</text>

  <text start="554.49" dur="5.08">Illustrator probably the best way to see</text>
  <text start="557.44" dur="5.61">it but it registers layers meaning that</text>
  <text start="559.57" dur="5.55">it recognizes it as a document that has</text>
  <text start="563.05" dur="5.07">multiple layers meaning multiple edits</text>
  <text start="565.12" dur="4.68">put on top of it and that just wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="568.12" dur="3.12">have happened if he was but you know I</text>
  <text start="569.8" dur="4.8">mean Photoshop just wasn&amp;#39;t around that</text>
  <text start="571.24" dur="4.95">long so it clearly looks to be a false</text>
  <text start="574.6" dur="3.45">and that&amp;#39;s a something that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="576.19" dur="3.99">discovered on my own research and other</text>

  <text start="853.709" dur="5.37">there right but Q is definitely pointing</text>
  <text start="856.17" dur="5.07">us out to the fact that wherever Obama</text>
  <text start="859.079" dur="4.141">comes from and wherever that birth</text>

  <text start="1801.17" dur="3.9">here&amp;#39;s a simplified answer for you the</text>
  <text start="1803.299" dur="4.291">really simplified answer is that the</text>
  <text start="1805.07" dur="5.25">kernel runs in kernel space and normal</text>
  <text start="1807.59" dur="4.709">programs run in user space user space is</text>
  <text start="1810.32" dur="3.75">basically a form of sandboxing it</text>
  <text start="1812.299" dur="3.571">restricts user programs so they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1814.07" dur="4.41">mess with memory and other resources</text>
  <text start="1815.87" dur="5.04">owned by other programs or by the OS</text>

  <text start="1820.91" dur="4.92">entirely eliminate their ability to do</text>
  <text start="1823.549" dur="4.171">bad things like crashing the machine the</text>
  <text start="1825.83" dur="4.26">kernel is the core of the operating</text>
  <text start="1827.72" dur="4.26">system it normally has full access to</text>
  <text start="1830.09" dur="4.62">all memory and machine hardware and</text>
  <text start="1831.98" dur="4.53">everything else on the machine to keep</text>
  <text start="1834.71" dur="3.959">the Machine as stable as possible you</text>
  <text start="1836.51" dur="4.919">normally want only the most trusted well</text>

  <text start="1847.07" dur="4.41">the rest of the memory well nature is</text>
  <text start="1849.049" dur="4.681">unpredictable and who knows maybe we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1851.48" dur="5.579">get ourselves a white squall popping up</text>
