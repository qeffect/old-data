  <text start="62.37" dur="6.36">it&amp;#39;s as majestic as it sounds but sadly</text>
  <text start="66.12" dur="4.44">it is not going to come to fruition this</text>
  <text start="68.73" dur="3.63">is from the POTUS Denmark is a very</text>
  <text start="70.56" dur="3.6">special country with incredible people</text>
  <text start="72.36" dur="3.84">but based on prime minister met</text>
  <text start="74.16" dur="3.87">frederickson&amp;#39;s comments that she would</text>
  <text start="76.2" dur="3.21">have no interest in discussing the</text>
  <text start="78.03" dur="3.15">purchase of Greenland I will be</text>
  <text start="79.41" dur="3.569">postponing our meeting scheduled in two</text>
  <text start="81.18" dur="3.21">weeks for another time the Prime</text>
  <text start="82.979" dur="3.031">Minister was able to save a great deal</text>
  <text start="84.39" dur="3.479">of expense and effort for both the</text>
  <text start="86.01" dur="3.78">United States and Denmark by being so</text>
  <text start="87.869" dur="3.871">direct I thank her for that and they</text>
  <text start="89.79" dur="6.87">look forward to rescheduling some time</text>
  <text start="91.74" dur="7.11">in the future so ladies and gentlemen</text>
  <text start="96.66" dur="5.67">over the last 48 hours my life was</text>
  <text start="98.85" dur="6.269">filled with puppets and purpose puffins</text>
  <text start="102.33" dur="4.74">and full purpose purposeful puffins and</text>
  <text start="105.119" dur="3.331">sadly that is not going to happen</text>
  <text start="107.07" dur="4.34">so I guess we&amp;#39;ll just have to get</text>
  <text start="108.45" dur="2.96">Presutti on something else</text>
  <text start="114.72" dur="4.29">all right I might not get my puffins</text>
  <text start="116.94" dur="4.14">ranch as soon as I had hoped</text>
  <text start="119.01" dur="3.51">but we can still look into my POTUS was</text>
  <text start="121.08" dur="3.12">looking to buy this thing in the first</text>
  <text start="122.52" dur="3.69">place why was POTUS going after</text>
  <text start="124.2" dur="3.98">Greenland well let&amp;#39;s go to some of the</text>
  <text start="126.21" dur="6.03">obvious reasons here this is uh from</text>
  <text start="128.18" dur="5.98">2013 science time calm and the title is</text>
  <text start="132.24" dur="3.78">eco-centric all things green from</text>
  <text start="134.16" dur="3.81">conservation to capitol hill which means</text>
  <text start="136.02" dur="4.2">everything that you read from here on is</text>
  <text start="137.97" dur="4.47">gonna be probably about global warming a</text>

  <text start="146.85" dur="4.71">West Virginia has been found underneath</text>
  <text start="148.89" dur="5.37">the ice in Greenland what that means for</text>
  <text start="151.56" dur="5.25">the rising seas and an aquifer is fir</text>
  <text start="154.26" dur="5.43">with water all over it</text>
  <text start="156.81" dur="7.19">the earth may be more than 4.5 billion</text>
  <text start="159.69" dur="4.31">years old but it can still surprise us</text>
  <text start="164.18" dur="3.61">scientists have discovered a gigantic</text>
  <text start="166.2" dur="4.02">liquid water reservoir underneath</text>
  <text start="167.79" dur="4.38">Greenland&amp;#39;s massive ice sheet the</text>
  <text start="170.22" dur="3.92">discovery was reported in an article in</text>
  <text start="172.17" dur="4.46">this week&amp;#39;s edition of Nature Geoscience</text>
  <text start="174.14" dur="5.02">uncovered accidentally by a team of</text>
  <text start="176.63" dur="5.35">glaciologist who were drilling ice cores</text>
  <text start="179.16" dur="6.45">in southeastern Greenland in 2011 the</text>
  <text start="181.98" dur="5.34">aquifer is more than 27,000 square miles</text>
  <text start="185.61" dur="3.78">large bigger than West Virginia</text>
  <text start="187.32" dur="3.21">according to data from nasa&amp;#39;s operation</text>
  <text start="189.39" dur="4.41">icebridge</text>
  <text start="190.53" dur="5.97">radar until recently no one had any idea</text>
  <text start="193.8" dur="4.89">it was there that&amp;#39;s because on the</text>
  <text start="196.5" dur="4.23">surface at least it shouldn&amp;#39;t be there</text>
  <text start="198.69" dur="4.32">temperatures in Greenland are well below</text>
  <text start="200.73" dur="4.229">freezing most of this year and that is</text>
  <text start="203.01" dur="3.87">why the island is covered by a sheet of</text>
  <text start="204.959" dur="4.741">ice that is more than a mile 1.6</text>
  <text start="206.88" dur="5.579">kilometers thick yet when the</text>
  <text start="209.7" dur="4.83">glaciologist drilling in 2011 led by the</text>
  <text start="212.459" dur="4.441">university of utah&amp;#39;s rick forester</text>
  <text start="214.53" dur="4.02">extracted their deep ice cores they were</text>
  <text start="216.9" dur="3.839">surprised to find them dripping with</text>
  <text start="218.55" dur="5.01">liquid water despite temperatures that</text>
  <text start="220.739" dur="5.311">were below zero later research carried</text>
  <text start="223.56" dur="4.41">out in April 2013 with Laura Koenig a</text>
  <text start="226.05" dur="4.11">glaciologist with NASA&amp;#39;s Goddard Space</text>
  <text start="227.97" dur="4.41">Flight Center found that the temperature</text>
  <text start="230.16" dur="4.53">in the aquifer stayed about 32 degrees</text>
  <text start="232.38" dur="4.02">Fahrenheit just above freezing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="234.69" dur="3.87">possible that the heavy snow cover in</text>
  <text start="236.4" dur="4.38">southeastern Greenland may act as</text>
  <text start="238.56" dur="3.72">insulation for the aquifer a literal</text>
  <text start="240.78" dur="3.66">blanket of snow preventing it from</text>
  <text start="242.28" dur="3.93">freezing okay so is that what it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="244.44" dur="2.55">about it&amp;#39;s all about just discovering</text>
  <text start="246.21" dur="3.78">this</text>
  <text start="246.99" dur="4.38">melting down aquifer is that what all</text>
  <text start="249.99" dur="2.79">this is fer well let&amp;#39;s take a little</text>

  <text start="471.51" dur="4.53">it sees over 3,000 flights every year</text>
  <text start="474.54" dur="3.74">how about that so this place is pretty</text>
  <text start="476.04" dur="4.8">important this polar puffin place</text>
  <text start="478.28" dur="4.84">military forces have hung around this</text>

  <text start="489.84" dur="5.21">however the first military construction</text>
  <text start="492.3" dur="5.37">was authorized in the summer of 1941</text>
  <text start="495.05" dur="3.91">therefore the base was initially opened</text>
  <text start="497.67" dur="2.94">during World War two</text>
  <text start="498.96" dur="3.21">the place was mostly used to provide</text>

  <text start="502.17" dur="4.26">through a multitude of stations many of</text>

  <text start="517.74" dur="4.74">atomic bombs in just a few years the</text>
  <text start="520.62" dur="4.14">site became a very strategical point of</text>

  <text start="534.03" dur="4.35">the Danish had to deal with the</text>
  <text start="535.56" dur="4.98">operational issues on their own so it</text>
  <text start="538.38" dur="4.17">gives a little perspective as to why</text>
  <text start="540.54" dur="4.62">POTUS might be trying to purchase this</text>
  <text start="542.55" dur="4.65">place even in just a casual fashion</text>
  <text start="545.16" dur="5.55">right the official construction of an</text>
  <text start="547.2" dur="5.13">advanced military base began in 1951 due</text>
  <text start="550.71" dur="3.03">to the harsh weather conditions and the</text>
  <text start="552.33" dur="3.15">improper environment it took the</text>
  <text start="553.74" dur="2.79">builders two years to finish it they</text>
  <text start="555.48" dur="2.79">were living on the ships that</text>
  <text start="556.53" dur="3.54">transported them until the headquarters</text>
  <text start="558.27" dur="3.39">was up it is said that the building this</text>
  <text start="560.07" dur="3.81">base was at least as complicated as</text>
  <text start="561.66" dur="3.6">building the Panama Canal I imagine so</text>
  <text start="563.88" dur="3.17">because they couldn&amp;#39;t fuel it and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="565.26" dur="3.63">why they decided to go ahead and make it</text>
  <text start="567.05" dur="4.42">nuclear-powered and of course has tons</text>
  <text start="568.89" dur="3.78">and tons of tunnels under there and of</text>
  <text start="571.47" dur="3.99">course we also know that there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="572.67" dur="4.8">underwater aquifer so I think you see</text>
  <text start="575.46" dur="5.58">what&amp;#39;s going on there&amp;#39;s a lot going on</text>
  <text start="577.47" dur="5.46">it looks like underneath Greenland do we</text>
  <text start="581.04" dur="3.63">have another China Lake situation I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="582.93" dur="4.92">not really sure but I&amp;#39;m sure if they</text>
  <text start="584.67" dur="5.28">built advanced construction back in 1951</text>
  <text start="587.85" dur="3.57">I&amp;#39;d have a hard time believing that it</text>
  <text start="589.95" dur="4.35">ever really stopped and that they</text>
  <text start="591.42" dur="4.71">actually left it alone right units</text>
  <text start="594.3" dur="4.44">spread over 14 time zones in six</text>

  <text start="832.4" dur="3.12">that they had nuclear capabilities out</text>

  <text start="837.08" dur="5.07">shuttling around a diesel fuel so that</text>
  <text start="840.02" dur="3.21">was it was kind of a necessity right so</text>
  <text start="842.15" dur="2.4">this has been going around for a long</text>
  <text start="843.23" dur="3.72">time we know there&amp;#39;s tunnels there we</text>
  <text start="844.55" dur="4.32">know there&amp;#39;s CIA involvement it starts</text>
  <text start="846.95" dur="4.05">to kind of fill itself in right we also</text>
  <text start="848.87" dur="4.14">know about this underground aquifers so</text>
  <text start="851" dur="4.44">we can imagine only imagine really what</text>
  <text start="853.01" dur="4.86">is going on underneath there but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="855.44" dur="4.11">been lots and lots of theories and we</text>
  <text start="857.87" dur="3.69">also know that a couple years after the</text>
  <text start="859.55" dur="4.23">article that I just read you around 2013</text>
  <text start="861.56" dur="3.84">or so they started to figure out that</text>
  <text start="863.78" dur="3.21">some of these flights were actually</text>
  <text start="865.4" dur="3.42">going in and out of North Carolina as</text>
  <text start="866.99" dur="4.68">well as Camp Peary and of course camp</text>
  <text start="868.82" dur="5.28">periods our CIA farm when we talked</text>
  <text start="871.67" dur="4.38">about the farm and CIA knuckleheads</text>
  <text start="874.1" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re all raised out there like a</text>
  <text start="876.05" dur="5.73">bunch of free-range deep state</text>
  <text start="877.58" dur="5.85">knucklehead farm crops right and so we</text>
  <text start="881.78" dur="3.57">we know that some of these flights were</text>
  <text start="883.43" dur="3.99">going is about one and every three was</text>
  <text start="885.35" dur="4.29">either going from North Carolina or from</text>
  <text start="887.42" dur="5.1">there so we know that this was heavily a</text>
  <text start="889.64" dur="5.55">clown influenced operation I can only</text>
  <text start="892.52" dur="5.34">imagine sub bases and whatnot so could</text>
  <text start="895.19" dur="4.83">this be a place where the deep state was</text>
  <text start="897.86" dur="4.08">doing some deep state knuckleheaded Rhee</text>
  <text start="900.02" dur="4.02">well we also know that some intelligence</text>
  <text start="901.94" dur="5.07">gathering was going on out there - it</text>
  <text start="904.04" dur="5.1">was sort of under the guise of spying on</text>
  <text start="907.01" dur="3.99">Middle Eastern countries but it looks</text>
  <text start="909.14" dur="4.32">like that cop possibly could have been</text>
  <text start="911" dur="4.59">more and knowing what we know now this</text>
  <text start="913.46" dur="5.61">very well could be another one of many</text>
  <text start="915.59" dur="4.179">outside the official five eyes chain of</text>
  <text start="919.07" dur="2.53">command Connor</text>
  <text start="919.769" dur="4.081">right this could have been skirting the</text>
  <text start="921.6" dur="4.919">five eyes intelligence-gathering system</text>
  <text start="923.85" dur="4.109">all together so I found this very very</text>
  <text start="926.519" dur="3.69">interesting the theories can kind of run</text>
  <text start="927.959" dur="4.32">wild here and maybe this was why</text>
  <text start="930.209" dur="4.891">President Trump was really talking about</text>
  <text start="932.279" dur="4.321">buying the land now I also want to</text>

  <text start="942.119" dur="3.89">change and this and that you&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="944.069" dur="5.101">hearing about her in the news right now</text>
  <text start="946.009" dur="4.211">well this isn&amp;#39;t Sweden but I just want</text>
  <text start="949.17" dur="2.43">to point out that I find it very</text>
  <text start="950.22" dur="3.359">interesting timing that we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="951.6" dur="3.63">to talk about you know the melting of</text>

  <text start="955.23" dur="4.799">sudden POTUS decides he wants to go</text>
  <text start="956.939" dur="4.14">ahead and buy Greenland now if you know</text>
  <text start="960.029" dur="2.761">anything about the art of the deal you</text>
  <text start="961.079" dur="4.35">know that more often than not</text>
  <text start="962.79" dur="4.859">president Trump finds uh you know deals</text>
  <text start="965.429" dur="4.2">that you can walk away from sometimes</text>
  <text start="967.649" dur="3.6">the best deal and maybe that&amp;#39;s all it</text>
  <text start="969.629" dur="3.3">really was to do to just kind of bring</text>
  <text start="971.249" dur="4.171">some attention on it right now like</text>
  <text start="972.929" dur="5.041">we&amp;#39;re talking about maybe something was</text>
  <text start="975.42" dur="4.229">going on out there maybe some illegal or</text>
  <text start="977.97" dur="3.809">outside like I said outside of the five</text>
  <text start="979.649" dur="3.99">ice channels surveillance going on who</text>
  <text start="981.779" dur="3.631">really knows but we also know that this</text>
  <text start="983.639" dur="4.62">is a clown operation and that they were</text>
  <text start="985.41" dur="4.589">doing transport of prisoners and kutiman</text>
  <text start="988.259" dur="3.661">some torture involves and who knows so</text>
  <text start="989.999" dur="5.07">there&amp;#39;s all kinds of different ideas</text>
  <text start="991.92" dur="5.219">that we can attach to this now when I</text>
