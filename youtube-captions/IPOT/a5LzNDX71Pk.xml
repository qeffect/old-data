  <text start="66.189" dur="3.331">until we do I want to make a quick</text>
  <text start="67.42" dur="4.259">correction to my last video entitled</text>
  <text start="69.52" dur="3.48">cardinal sins from the seventh we were</text>
  <text start="71.679" dur="3.72">talking about the Catholic Church</text>
  <text start="73" dur="5.52">particularly this raid on the Vatican&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="75.399" dur="4.47">Secretariat of state and there was a</text>
  <text start="78.52" dur="2.76">whole bunch of money being moved around</text>
  <text start="79.869" dur="3.721">we were talking a little bit about that</text>
  <text start="81.28" dur="4.259">and I ended up mentioning this Danielle</text>
  <text start="83.59" dur="4.02">boudin II and this Danielle boudin II</text>
  <text start="85.539" dur="3.811">seems to be a key figure real estate</text>
  <text start="87.61" dur="3.469">magnate as matter of fact they call him</text>
  <text start="89.35" dur="4.68">a scion he comes from a long family</text>
  <text start="91.079" dur="5.11">essentially of quite a bit of wealth in</text>
  <text start="94.03" dur="4.259">his relations with the Catholic Church</text>
  <text start="96.189" dur="5.311">and don&amp;#39;t allow anyway I flashed you</text>
  <text start="98.289" dur="5.431">this right here and we were talking</text>
  <text start="101.5" dur="4.02">about he has connections to possibly to</text>
  <text start="103.72" dur="4.289">Jeffrey Epstein and I referenced that</text>
  <text start="105.52" dur="3.959">this was the Jeffrey Epstein flight law</text>
  <text start="108.009" dur="3.9">but it&amp;#39;s actually the Jeffrey Epstein</text>
  <text start="109.479" dur="4.381">ledger anyway I misspoke and I wanted to</text>
  <text start="111.909" dur="4.14">make sure that I clarified on on that</text>
  <text start="113.86" dur="3.959">that although he does seem to be related</text>
  <text start="116.049" dur="4.41">somehow to Jeffrey Epstein and I show a</text>
  <text start="117.819" dur="4.11">couple different ways in that video but</text>
  <text start="120.459" dur="3.061">anyway I was setting you all up all</text>
  <text start="121.929" dur="3.48">dramatic like and I was getting all</text>
  <text start="123.52" dur="3.389">excited and I said it was the flight log</text>
  <text start="125.409" dur="3.751">and then listen back to it while I was</text>
  <text start="126.909" dur="4.86">drinking my coffee and I realized I</text>
  <text start="129.16" dur="4.56">misspoke and it kind of killed the barb</text>
  <text start="131.769" dur="3.991">so anyway we&amp;#39;re gonna try it again are</text>
  <text start="133.72" dur="3.599">you ready yeah all right sweet so it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="138.73" dur="2.849">go back and watch it and then you can</text>
  <text start="140.29" dur="4.59">come back here and then we can all</text>
  <text start="141.579" dur="5.761">pretend to go back to the seventh like</text>
  <text start="144.88" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;re gonna do right now okay so</text>
  <text start="147.34" dur="3.63">Danielle buddhini has connections to the</text>
  <text start="149.59" dur="2.91">Frick Center and the Frick Center</text>
  <text start="150.97" dur="3.45">clearly seems to have multiple</text>
  <text start="152.5" dur="3.42">connections to Jeffrey Epstein as well</text>
  <text start="154.42" dur="3.78">as a bunch of other knuckleheads right</text>
  <text start="155.92" dur="4.46">so is it possible that Danielle Bodine</text>
  <text start="158.2" dur="5.52">II might happen to know Jeffrey Epstein</text>
  <text start="160.38" dur="4.81">well how about Jeffrey Epstein&amp;#39;s little</text>

  <text start="168.3" dur="3.03">alright look I know it would have been</text>
  <text start="169.83" dur="3.09">way cooler if I had done it like that</text>
  <text start="171.33" dur="4.28">the first time but I figured I owed you</text>
  <text start="172.92" dur="4.65">the effort so it&amp;#39;s like the reheated</text>
  <text start="175.61" dur="4.57">version it&amp;#39;s like when you stick a</text>
  <text start="177.57" dur="4.77">burrito in the microwave to reheat it</text>
  <text start="180.18" dur="3.87">and it&amp;#39;s super hot on the outside but</text>
  <text start="182.34" dur="3">kind of cold on the inside and you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="184.05" dur="3.54">decide whether or not to stick it back</text>
  <text start="185.34" dur="4.11">in there and you&amp;#39;re like I&amp;#39;m just gonna</text>
  <text start="187.59" dur="3.12">eat it like this that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m doing</text>

  <text start="193.05" dur="6.23">can beat him again Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="195.36" dur="6.57">teases 2020 run that&amp;#39;s like alarm clock</text>
  <text start="199.28" dur="4.6">Hillary Clinton told a PBS reporter that</text>
  <text start="201.93" dur="4.41">she could win against President Trump in</text>
  <text start="203.88" dur="4.89">a 2020 rematch after he mockingly urged</text>
  <text start="206.34" dur="4.08">her to run again this next part right</text>
  <text start="208.77" dur="4.02">here is the actual tweets here they are</text>
  <text start="210.42" dur="4.2">I think that crooked Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="212.79" dur="4.71">should enter the race to try and steal</text>
  <text start="214.62" dur="4.35">it away from uber left Elizabeth Warren</text>
  <text start="217.5" dur="3.39">only on one condition</text>
  <text start="218.97" dur="4.02">the crooked one must explain all of her</text>
  <text start="220.89" dur="4.94">high crimes and misdemeanors including</text>
  <text start="222.99" dur="7.73">how and why she deleted 33,000 emails</text>
  <text start="225.83" dur="4.89">after getting C subpoena</text>
  <text start="233.18" dur="3.119">- which Hillary Clinton responds don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="235.549" dur="5.101">tempt me</text>
  <text start="236.299" dur="5.19">do your job Clinton 71 told PBS reporter</text>
  <text start="240.65" dur="4.44">Judy Woodruff</text>
  <text start="241.489" dur="5.821">that she would win in 2020 if she ran so</text>
  <text start="245.09" dur="3.81">maybe there does need to be a rematch I</text>
  <text start="247.31" dur="4.86">mean obviously I can beat him again</text>
  <text start="248.9" dur="4.919">Clinton said Clinton and her daughter</text>
  <text start="252.17" dur="3.539">Chelsea Clinton have been on a media</text>
  <text start="253.819" dur="4.561">tour this month promoting their new book</text>
  <text start="255.709" dur="6.3">the book of crusty women favorite stores</text>
  <text start="258.38" dur="6.78">gutsy women favorite stories of courage</text>
  <text start="262.009" dur="5.371">and resilience Clinton has denied she</text>
  <text start="265.16" dur="3.72">has plans to run but as continued to</text>
  <text start="267.38" dur="4.259">keep herself in the political spotlight</text>
  <text start="268.88" dur="4.86">by criticizing Trump and calling him an</text>
  <text start="271.639" dur="5.491">illegitimate President so essentially</text>
  <text start="273.74" dur="5.61">like every other Democrat ever in 2016</text>
  <text start="277.13" dur="6.09">she lost the race to trump by 304</text>
  <text start="279.35" dur="5.49">electoral votes to 227 but won the</text>
  <text start="283.22" dur="4.919">popular vote by almost three million</text>
  <text start="284.84" dur="4.77">votes yeah I&amp;#39;m not so sure that is true</text>
  <text start="288.139" dur="3">but either way it looks like she is at</text>
  <text start="289.61" dur="3.779">least dipping her foot in the water to</text>
  <text start="291.139" dur="3.691">test the waters of a potential run and</text>
  <text start="293.389" dur="2.971">it wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise me if a bunch of</text>
  <text start="294.83" dur="3.209">these knucklehead candidates are really</text>
  <text start="296.36" dur="4.23">just kind of playing to see who is going</text>
  <text start="298.039" dur="3.991">to be the potential running mate and I</text>
  <text start="300.59" dur="4.139">would throw out there - don&amp;#39;t forget</text>
  <text start="302.03" dur="4.83">about Stacey Abrams out there - who</text>
  <text start="304.729" dur="3.75">might kind of swing in as a dark horse I</text>
  <text start="306.86" dur="3.839">think some of the potential real</text>
  <text start="308.479" dur="3.781">candidates might be avoiding this whole</text>
  <text start="310.699" dur="4.111">storm and they&amp;#39;re kind of just trotting</text>
  <text start="312.26" dur="4.62">out these knuckleheads to go and really</text>
  <text start="314.81" dur="3.84">make the debates look ridiculous so that</text>
  <text start="316.88" dur="3.39">Hillary can kind of step in and look as</text>
  <text start="318.65" dur="3.87">if she&amp;#39;s sort of the voice of reason</text>
  <text start="320.27" dur="3.329">same thing with stacey abrams now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="322.52" dur="3.51">not saying that&amp;#39;s gonna be the ticket</text>
  <text start="323.599" dur="3.81">I&amp;#39;m just gonna be to say that I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="326.03" dur="3.6">be surprised if it looked something like</text>
  <text start="327.409" dur="3.781">that but if Hillary wants to get</text>
  <text start="329.63" dur="3.81">anywhere at all she&amp;#39;s gonna have to try</text>
  <text start="331.19" dur="3.78">and pick the most popular running mate</text>
  <text start="333.44" dur="4.83">cuz I think she knows that she&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="334.97" dur="4.83">that popular and we&amp;#39;ve already kind of</text>
  <text start="338.27" dur="3.959">talked about this at great length this</text>
  <text start="339.8" dur="4.26">should be no surprise at all this is a</text>
  <text start="342.229" dur="2.97">lot of defensive posturing I think a lot</text>
  <text start="344.06" dur="3.27">of people who are running against</text>
  <text start="345.199" dur="4.021">president Trump are doing so in a</text>
  <text start="347.33" dur="3.899">defensive manner to claim political</text>
  <text start="349.22" dur="3.66">persecution if he goes after them and</text>
  <text start="351.229" dur="3.331">we&amp;#39;ve seen this sort of thing with Joe</text>
  <text start="352.88" dur="3.69">Biden the very thing is playing out with</text>
  <text start="354.56" dur="3.45">Joe Biden why are you picking on Joe</text>
  <text start="356.57" dur="3.75">Biden because he&amp;#39;s running against you</text>
  <text start="358.01" dur="3.87">it becomes a democratic talking point of</text>
  <text start="360.32" dur="3.24">course we know it&amp;#39;s not the case we know</text>
  <text start="361.88" dur="4.469">that there&amp;#39;s reasons to investigate Joe</text>
  <text start="363.56" dur="3.63">Biden his son hunter Biden and same</text>
  <text start="366.349" dur="2.941">thing with Pelosi other</text>
  <text start="367.19" dur="3.84">she&amp;#39;s not running but you see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="369.29" dur="3.93">going on right it&amp;#39;s easy to claim</text>
  <text start="371.03" dur="4.56">political persecution if you&amp;#39;re running</text>
  <text start="373.22" dur="5.28">against him and that might be Hillary&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="375.59" dur="4.47">next choice of action here because at</text>
  <text start="378.5" dur="3.12">some point this is all gonna come back</text>
  <text start="380.06" dur="3.72">to her and I think she&amp;#39;s smart enough to</text>
  <text start="381.62" dur="3.87">know that I don&amp;#39;t really think she</text>
  <text start="383.78" dur="4.59">thinks she can win of course even she</text>
  <text start="385.49" dur="4.14">said that she was just kidding but we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="388.37" dur="3.99">known about this for quite some time</text>
  <text start="389.63" dur="4.56">definitely some defensive posturing but</text>

  <text start="823.249" dur="4.5">out too little to no fanfare so I find</text>
  <text start="826.579" dur="3.151">it interesting that we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="827.749" dur="4.59">see these stories kind of leak</text>
  <text start="829.73" dur="4.529">particularly this one like I said at the</text>
  <text start="832.339" dur="3.631">very same time where Hillary starts kind</text>
  <text start="834.259" dur="3.45">of teasing that she&amp;#39;s going to get back</text>
  <text start="835.97" dur="3.119">in the game seems like everything is</text>
  <text start="837.709" dur="4.641">coming together right around the same</text>
  <text start="839.089" dur="5.1">time but this story deals with in</text>
  <text start="842.35" dur="4.419">specifically they&amp;#39;re talking about this</text>
  <text start="844.189" dur="4.801">one game the Washington Nationals versus</text>
  <text start="846.769" dur="3.78">the Florida Florida Marlins these are</text>
  <text start="848.99" dur="3.629">two baseball teams in which he looks</text>
  <text start="850.549" dur="5.1">like he accepted some tickets says here</text>
  <text start="852.619" dur="5.22">on April 3rd 2017 he said he could no</text>
  <text start="855.649" dur="3.9">longer recall whether he repaid the CNN</text>
  <text start="857.839" dur="3.451">correspondent for the tickets wow so you</text>
  <text start="859.549" dur="4.861">repaid him for the tickets the Nationals</text>
  <text start="861.29" dur="6.479">versus Marlins you got screwed twice</text>
  <text start="864.41" dur="4.95">those are terrible teams I can already</text>
  <text start="867.769" dur="3.78">hear you guys clicking the hate right</text>
  <text start="869.36" dur="3.99">now come at me go Yankees he said that</text>
  <text start="871.549" dur="3.9">he intended to reimburse the reporter</text>
  <text start="873.35" dur="4.679">when they met two weeks later but the</text>
  <text start="875.449" dur="4.11">reporter declined Courtin also reversed</text>
  <text start="878.029" dur="3.511">his previous statement that his guest</text>
  <text start="879.559" dur="2.571">that the game was not with the FBI</text>
  <text start="881.54" dur="2.72">it</text>
  <text start="882.13" dur="4.86">meaning that a fellow FBI colleague went</text>
  <text start="884.26" dur="5.82">with him to the September 30th 2016 game</text>
  <text start="886.99" dur="4.8">the OIG deemed the CNN reporter a</text>
  <text start="890.08" dur="4.67">prohibited source because of his job</text>
  <text start="891.79" dur="4.89">covering the FBI and law enforcement be</text>
  <text start="894.75" dur="4.12">accordingly as part of the CNN</text>
  <text start="896.68" dur="3.81">correspondents jobs responsibilities and</text>
  <text start="898.87" dur="3.56">this is the important part this was part</text>
  <text start="900.49" dur="5.1">of the CNN correspondents job</text>
  <text start="902.43" dur="6.46">responsibilities he saw official action</text>
  <text start="905.59" dur="6.03">by court an and the FBI conducted</text>
  <text start="908.89" dur="4.5">business with the FBI and his interests</text>
  <text start="911.62" dur="4.26">were substantially affected by the</text>
  <text start="913.39" dur="5.07">performance or non-performance</text>
  <text start="915.88" dur="4.11">of court an and the FBI&amp;#39;s responses to</text>
  <text start="918.46" dur="3.99">his request for information and</text>
  <text start="919.99" dur="4.56">commentary for reporting on the FBI and</text>
  <text start="922.45" dur="3.42">its work the report says okay so the</text>
  <text start="924.55" dur="3.57">reason why this is so important is that</text>
  <text start="925.87" dur="5.91">here you have these clown knuckleheads</text>
  <text start="928.12" dur="5.73">like Bruce and Nelly Bruce and Nelly or</text>
  <text start="931.78" dur="4.41">either or they were getting some</text>
  <text start="933.85" dur="4.02">information from Russia Russia Russia</text>
  <text start="936.19" dur="3.75">right and of course they were passing</text>
  <text start="937.87" dur="4.05">this on now we don&amp;#39;t know directly to</text>
  <text start="939.94" dur="3.45">who could have been you know somebody</text>
  <text start="941.92" dur="3.75">like Glenn Simpson could have been a</text>
  <text start="943.39" dur="4.71">number of sources Peter struck and it</text>
  <text start="945.67" dur="4.56">could have been James Beck he could have</text>
  <text start="948.1" dur="4.46">been Mike court an and here we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="950.23" dur="5.46">these CNN correspondents that are</text>
  <text start="952.56" dur="5.86">obviously giving some tickets to court</text>
  <text start="955.69" dur="5.61">on one of these correspondents jobs is</text>
  <text start="958.42" dur="4.98">actually deal with the FBI this looks</text>
  <text start="961.3" dur="4.11">like a great place to talk about stuff</text>
  <text start="963.4" dur="4.38">right in between a few innings of</text>
  <text start="965.41" dur="4.08">baseball the investigation bears some</text>
  <text start="967.78" dur="3.93">resemblance into an investigation of</text>
  <text start="969.49" dur="4.47">Andrew McCabe the former FBI deputy</text>
  <text start="971.71" dur="3.99">director the OIG found that McCabe</text>
  <text start="973.96" dur="4.05">displayed a lack of candor that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="975.7" dur="4.11">we heard it before during multiple</text>
  <text start="978.01" dur="5.28">interviews about whether he authorized</text>
  <text start="979.81" dur="5.7">leaks to a reporter in October 2016 for</text>
  <text start="983.29" dur="4.95">a story about an investigation of you</text>
  <text start="985.51" dur="4.83">guessed it the Clinton Foundation McCabe</text>
  <text start="988.24" dur="3.9">directed his chief counsel Lisa Paige to</text>
  <text start="990.34" dur="3.24">make contact with Devlin Barrett who</text>
  <text start="992.14" dur="4.62">works for The Wall Street Journal at the</text>
  <text start="993.58" dur="6.06">time so here we have another classic</text>
  <text start="996.76" dur="4.71">example of our alphabet agencies being</text>
  <text start="999.64" dur="3.27">in contact with the media of course</text>
  <text start="1001.47" dur="3.63">that&amp;#39;s how we know that a lot of this</text>
  <text start="1002.91" dur="4.23">stuff was getting out whether it be</text>
  <text start="1005.1" dur="3.63">through myself Michael Isikoff and here</text>
  <text start="1007.14" dur="3.24">we&amp;#39;re seeing an example of CNN in New</text>
  <text start="1008.73" dur="3.84">York Times but we&amp;#39;ve seen this time and</text>
  <text start="1010.38" dur="3.69">time again we know Brennan was involved</text>
  <text start="1012.57" dur="2.91">in this we know clapper was involved in</text>
  <text start="1014.07" dur="3.389">this looks like Mike Orton</text>
  <text start="1015.48" dur="3.99">was involved in this we already knew</text>
  <text start="1017.459" dur="3.99">according to their own testimony that</text>
  <text start="1019.47" dur="3.419">Bruce and Nellie or were part of</text>
  <text start="1021.449" dur="3.091">Drummond this information up they were</text>
  <text start="1022.889" dur="2.581">doing the research work right and we</text>
  <text start="1024.54" dur="2.46">knew that they were taking that</text>
  <text start="1025.47" dur="2.969">information and turning it turning</text>
  <text start="1027" dur="2.699">around and sharing it with somebody and</text>
  <text start="1028.439" dur="3.24">of course that information would then</text>
  <text start="1029.699" dur="5.521">get leaked to the media we also know</text>
  <text start="1031.679" dur="5.941">that back in the day 2015 the IC IG had</text>
  <text start="1035.22" dur="4.199">warned Peter struck that China was</text>
  <text start="1037.62" dur="3.839">getting a hold of Hillary&amp;#39;s emails and</text>
  <text start="1039.419" dur="4.77">Peter struck decided to not do much</text>
  <text start="1041.459" dur="4.651">about that right and we already knew</text>
  <text start="1044.189" dur="3.601">this and of course he was perfectly</text>
  <text start="1046.11" dur="4.11">happy to go ahead and prosecute mr.</text>
  <text start="1047.79" dur="3.9">Flynn right so we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="1050.22" dur="2.91">these connections more and more and even</text>
  <text start="1051.69" dur="3.18">though though it&amp;#39;s been out there we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1053.13" dur="4.289">just now starting to see it leaked out</text>
  <text start="1054.87" dur="4.83">into the media and of course it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1057.419" dur="4.471">interesting timing considering like I</text>
  <text start="1059.7" dur="3.719">just said Hillary Clinton decides to go</text>
  <text start="1061.89" dur="4.02">ahead and test the waters for running</text>
  <text start="1063.419" dur="4.531">and I can&amp;#39;t imagine this being anything</text>
  <text start="1065.91" dur="3.54">other than defensive it&amp;#39;s the same thing</text>
  <text start="1067.95" dur="3.599">with Joe Biden and I said this weeks ago</text>
  <text start="1069.45" dur="3.75">to Joe Biden never really wanted to run</text>
  <text start="1071.549" dur="3.12">he knew he wasn&amp;#39;t going to win I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1073.2" dur="3.39">think he&amp;#39;s really got the energy to run</text>
  <text start="1074.669" dur="4.321">but there&amp;#39;s no real choice at this point</text>
  <text start="1076.59" dur="5.91">you have to claim political persecution</text>
  <text start="1078.99" dur="5.4">otherwise you&amp;#39;re fair game and so I</text>
  <text start="1082.5" dur="5.04">think that&amp;#39;s why Hillary&amp;#39;s at least</text>
  <text start="1084.39" dur="4.89">talking about getting in his game now we</text>
  <text start="1087.54" dur="2.55">have this quote-unquote whistleblower</text>

  <text start="1249.6" dur="3.9">gonna get through the house and is that</text>
