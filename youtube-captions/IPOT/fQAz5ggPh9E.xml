  <text start="63.02" dur="6.84">on their wrists that is a mystery we are</text>
  <text start="67.28" dur="3.99">on Pittsburgh&amp;#39;s Action News 4 and I just</text>
  <text start="69.86" dur="4.2">want to point out that the anchor his</text>
  <text start="71.27" dur="4.74">name is Chris lovingood and I think</text>
  <text start="74.06" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s funny because I&amp;#39;m for Pittsburgh</text>
  <text start="76.01" dur="3.9">police are investigating after three</text>
  <text start="78.11" dur="3.72">people died and four were hospitalized</text>
  <text start="79.91" dur="3.72">following what police said appeared to</text>
  <text start="81.83" dur="3.96">be a drug overdose in Southside</text>
  <text start="83.63" dur="4.59">early Sunday the three dead have been</text>
  <text start="85.79" dur="6.56">identified as Ruby L Clemente Martinez</text>

  <text start="105.229" dur="3.481">over the dank place</text>
  <text start="106.34" dur="5.19">police said all the victims were males</text>
  <text start="108.71" dur="4.89">mmm is that buck where&amp;#39;s that bucked at</text>
  <text start="111.53" dur="4.83">he&amp;#39;s done Pittsburgh police were at</text>
  <text start="113.6" dur="4.71">Southside work city apartment on Tunnel</text>
  <text start="116.36" dur="5.79">Boulevard around 7:00 a.m.</text>
  <text start="118.31" dur="5.31">oddly enough tunnel Boulevard and said</text>
  <text start="122.15" dur="3.84">each victim was wearing an orange</text>
  <text start="123.62" dur="4.8">wristband police said the victims all</text>
  <text start="125.99" dur="4.89">took narcotics at the same time and then</text>
  <text start="128.42" dur="4.65">the same location this sounds like an ad</text>
  <text start="130.88" dur="4.02">bar party police said this was not a</text>
  <text start="133.07" dur="3.69">case of tainted drug being passed around</text>
  <text start="134.9" dur="4.11">or distributed in large volume and a</text>
  <text start="136.76" dur="4.74">venue that could have affected more</text>
  <text start="139.01" dur="5.07">people it appears to have been isolated</text>
  <text start="141.5" dur="3.87">to a single location the conditions of</text>
  <text start="144.08" dur="3.57">the victims in the hospital range from</text>
  <text start="145.37" dur="4.02">serious to critical police said they are</text>
  <text start="147.65" dur="3.33">concerned about a tainted potentially</text>
  <text start="149.39" dur="4.17">deadly batch of drugs in the community</text>
  <text start="150.98" dur="5.039">we remind the public not to use drugs</text>
  <text start="153.56" dur="4.679">simply put you do not know what&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="156.019" dur="4.381">that drug police said in a news release</text>
  <text start="158.239" dur="3.871">police identified multiple venues in the</text>
  <text start="160.4" dur="3.69">city that used orange wristbands</text>
  <text start="162.11" dur="4.08">Saturday night for events and concerts</text>
  <text start="164.09" dur="4.679">anyone who attended one of these events</text>
  <text start="166.19" dur="5.31">has no cause for concern regarding their</text>
  <text start="168.769" dur="3.991">health according to police and then this</text>
  <text start="171.5" dur="2.61">is the statement here the event</text>
  <text start="172.76" dur="2.94">individuals that were involved in the</text>
  <text start="174.11" dur="3.27">incident we&amp;#39;re not residents of our</text>
  <text start="175.7" dur="3.48">community it is our understanding that</text>
  <text start="177.38" dur="4.32">they were acquaintances of a resident in</text>
  <text start="179.18" dur="4.08">good standing it is also our</text>
  <text start="181.7" dur="3.39">understanding that the group had</text>
  <text start="183.26" dur="3.449">attended an outside event we</text>
  <text start="185.09" dur="3.179">for returning to the apartment we</text>
  <text start="186.709" dur="2.881">express our deepest sympathies to the</text>
  <text start="188.269" dur="3.061">families and friends of the affected</text>
  <text start="189.59" dur="3.27">individuals and send our thoughts and</text>
  <text start="191.33" dur="2.25">prayers to those who were transported to</text>
  <text start="192.86" dur="2.159">the hospital</text>
  <text start="193.58" dur="2.67">we were working closely with local</text>
  <text start="195.019" dur="3.36">authorities and this is an ongoing</text>
  <text start="196.25" dur="3.989">police investigation all questions</text>
  <text start="198.379" dur="3.931">should be directed to the Pittsburgh</text>
  <text start="200.239" dur="3.961">Police Department okay so this is a</text>
  <text start="202.31" dur="3.87">pretty rough story here and there might</text>
  <text start="204.2" dur="3.48">not be anything real suspicious to this</text>
  <text start="206.18" dur="4.02">this might have just been a party gone</text>
  <text start="207.68" dur="4.29">wrong but we have seven people all of</text>
  <text start="210.2" dur="3.45">them were wearing the same orange</text>
  <text start="211.97" dur="3.54">wristband so we can assume they were all</text>
  <text start="213.65" dur="2.88">at the same party it appears that it</text>
  <text start="215.51" dur="2.88">would have been in this apartment</text>
  <text start="216.53" dur="4.14">because they found five of them in the</text>
  <text start="218.39" dur="5.159">apartment three of them died and four of</text>
  <text start="220.67" dur="6.81">them are in the hospital so this was a</text>
  <text start="223.549" dur="6">rough night don&amp;#39;t do drugs kids</text>
  <text start="227.48" dur="3.39">but that&amp;#39;s evidently what happened</text>
  <text start="229.549" dur="3.361">though I don&amp;#39;t know if there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="230.87" dur="5.13">deeper to this or not but I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="232.91" dur="5.13">very very interesting and it seems like</text>
  <text start="236" dur="4.44">that everybody that was touching on</text>
  <text start="238.04" dur="4.229">these stories kind of touched on it and</text>
  <text start="240.44" dur="4.079">then left it alone this is an example</text>
  <text start="242.269" dur="3.961">here CNN police say the overdose deaths</text>
  <text start="244.519" dur="3.69">at a Pittsburgh apartment were isolated</text>
  <text start="246.23" dur="3.78">to that location all the victims were</text>
  <text start="248.209" dur="3.961">wearing orange wristbands stoking</text>
  <text start="250.01" dur="4.02">initial concerns a widespread health</text>
  <text start="252.17" dur="3.99">emergency okay well I don&amp;#39;t know miss</text>
  <text start="254.03" dur="3.48">with this was fentanyl related or</text>
  <text start="256.16" dur="2.94">something else I&amp;#39;m not really sure I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="257.51" dur="3.12">not really up on modern drugs don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="259.1" dur="3.27">really care that much but it seems like</text>
  <text start="260.63" dur="4.05">this is pretty awful now whatever</text>
  <text start="262.37" dur="4.59">happened at this party might have just</text>
  <text start="264.68" dur="4.859">been something out of control but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="266.96" dur="4.32">interesting here is that there are a lot</text>
  <text start="269.539" dur="4.44">of these news outlets reported that</text>
  <text start="271.28" dur="4.44">stoking initial concerns of a widespread</text>
  <text start="273.979" dur="3.81">health emergency and that&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="275.72" dur="4.02">they did well if you&amp;#39;re stoking initial</text>
  <text start="277.789" dur="3.871">concerns of a wide spread health</text>
  <text start="279.74" dur="4.41">emergency you would think that you&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="281.66" dur="4.259">responsible enough to quell that when</text>
  <text start="284.15" dur="3.21">you kind of know what&amp;#39;s up but it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="285.919" dur="3.451">really seem like a lot of these news</text>
  <text start="287.36" dur="3.63">organizations have followed up much and</text>
  <text start="289.37" dur="2.82">if you just go down and below and see</text>
  <text start="290.99" dur="3.69">the posts and stuff like that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="292.19" dur="5.49">lot of speculation there but it seems</text>
  <text start="294.68" dur="4.59">like nobody you know CNN hasn&amp;#39;t come up</text>
  <text start="297.68" dur="5.13">with a follow-up post is what I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="299.27" dur="5.55">a lot of these MSM conglomerates aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="302.81" dur="4.5">really following up on this story so</text>
  <text start="304.82" dur="4.849">anyway I want to point out I got some</text>
  <text start="307.31" dur="5.87">reports here at the nearby river Casino</text>
  <text start="309.669" dur="4.721">looks like this TV right here DJ Pauly D</text>
  <text start="313.18" dur="5.44">he</text>
  <text start="314.39" dur="7.56">yeah he&amp;#39;s uh he&amp;#39;s DJing over at the</text>
  <text start="318.62" dur="4.92">Rivers Casino and the reports were is</text>
  <text start="321.95" dur="3.12">that his event was giving out orange</text>
  <text start="323.54" dur="3.36">bands now if you&amp;#39;re going to something</text>
  <text start="325.07" dur="2.88">like this a concert or some sort of</text>
  <text start="326.9" dur="2.52">performance at a casino or something</text>
  <text start="327.95" dur="3.45">like that makes sense that they would</text>
  <text start="329.42" dur="3.99">give wristbands so it&amp;#39;s hard to know if</text>
  <text start="331.4" dur="4.29">this was an after party maybe coming</text>
  <text start="333.41" dur="3.93">from this I&amp;#39;m most certainly not blind</text>
  <text start="335.69" dur="4.29">that this guy had anything to do with it</text>
  <text start="337.34" dur="4.7">this guy looks like he&amp;#39;s got some he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="339.98" dur="5.49">got it going on right there and uh</text>
  <text start="342.04" dur="5.08">anyway so but that was the reports that</text>
  <text start="345.47" dur="3.99">I got a couple reports coming out of</text>
  <text start="347.12" dur="3.51">Rivers Casino saying that so it might</text>
  <text start="349.46" dur="2.94">have been distributed there maybe these</text>
  <text start="350.63" dur="3.48">people ended up at this apartment but it</text>
  <text start="352.4" dur="4.05">seems more than likely that whatever</text>
  <text start="354.11" dur="4.53">this was probably originated from this</text>
  <text start="356.45" dur="4.02">apartment police are indeed interested</text>
  <text start="358.64" dur="3.96">in venues that were hosting events that</text>
  <text start="360.47" dur="3.99">had orange wristbands and of course I</text>
  <text start="362.6" dur="4.41">just pointed the one out at the nearby</text>
  <text start="364.46" dur="4.56">casino but that got me thinking a little</text>
  <text start="367.01" dur="3.36">bit and I just kind of applied the usual</text>
  <text start="369.02" dur="3.57">process to a lot of these stories</text>
  <text start="370.37" dur="5.16">especially when I hear stories kind of</text>
  <text start="372.59" dur="4.71">die out in the media I went searching</text>
  <text start="375.53" dur="3.09">and through the normal process I wanted</text>
  <text start="377.3" dur="3.03">to just kind of point out a couple of</text>
  <text start="378.62" dur="2.73">things that I found but at the center</text>
  <text start="380.33" dur="3.93">right of your screen you can see</text>
  <text start="381.35" dur="4.65">Southside Works 26:26 tunnel Boulevard</text>
  <text start="384.26" dur="2.97">I&amp;#39;m always interested in tunnel as I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="386" dur="2.25">not so sure it has anything to do with</text>
  <text start="387.23" dur="3.27">this story but I found an interesting</text>
  <text start="388.25" dur="4.14">there was tunnel Boulevard but over here</text>
  <text start="390.5" dur="4.8">I found this very interesting here we</text>
  <text start="392.39" dur="5.85">have this asset STEM education Tarkin</text>
  <text start="395.3" dur="6.42">core new vision engineering mu net ryx</text>
  <text start="398.24" dur="5.22">the sharp edge labs and here is immune</text>
  <text start="401.72" dur="3.57">networks first thing I noticed was of</text>
  <text start="403.46" dur="3.69">course the logo there&amp;#39;s that fancy</text>
  <text start="405.29" dur="2.49">spiral right there and here would be one</text>
  <text start="407.15" dur="2.88">six</text>
  <text start="407.78" dur="5.04">inger this way that would be another six</text>
  <text start="410.03" dur="5.49">and then the last one would also be a</text>
  <text start="412.82" dur="4.14">six just saying immune Ettrick said</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="3.66">immune networks we build predictive</text>
  <text start="416.96" dur="4.26">biological models of drug targets and</text>
  <text start="419.18" dur="4.53">clinical trials our model simulations</text>
  <text start="421.22" dur="4.94">are able to inform our clients decisions</text>
  <text start="423.71" dur="5.31">and all stages of drug development</text>
  <text start="426.16" dur="5.17">including preclinical targeting trial</text>
  <text start="429.02" dur="5.31">designs combination drug synergies</text>
  <text start="431.33" dur="6.45">target patient populations new</text>
  <text start="434.33" dur="5.75">indications and FDA requests all right</text>
  <text start="437.78" dur="5.25">right next door with sharp-edged labs</text>
  <text start="440.08" dur="5.02">sharp-edged labs discovering drugs to</text>
  <text start="443.03" dur="4.98">treat genetic disorders of protein</text>
  <text start="445.1" dur="3.26">trafficking that&amp;#39;s why they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="448.01" dur="1.85">to</text>
  <text start="448.36" dur="4.26">to eat meat because they&amp;#39;re trafficking</text>
  <text start="449.86" dur="4.769">all the protein no I just made that uh</text>
  <text start="452.62" dur="4.65">alright so here we have this sharp edge</text>
  <text start="454.629" dur="5">lab stem-cell research right next to any</text>
  <text start="457.27" dur="4.41">metrics which deals with target patient</text>
  <text start="459.629" dur="4.75">populations you know just in case you</text>
  <text start="461.68" dur="4.5">need to try out a drug around target</text>
  <text start="464.379" dur="4.29">populations maybe you give them a</text>
  <text start="466.18" dur="4.47">wristband or no I&amp;#39;m not saying that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="468.669" dur="3.15">just saying but I do find it very</text>
  <text start="470.65" dur="2.46">interesting and I find it very</text>
  <text start="471.819" dur="3.06">interesting that they&amp;#39;re located right</text>
  <text start="473.11" dur="3.869">next to a stem education center and of</text>
  <text start="474.879" dur="4.141">course STEM education and stem cell</text>
  <text start="476.979" dur="4.321">research that&amp;#39;s not the same thing at</text>
  <text start="479.02" dur="4.92">all even though if you kind of take a</text>
  <text start="481.3" dur="5.31">bigger picture look at it it Cana is</text>
  <text start="483.94" dur="5.539">this new vision engineering is nuclear</text>
  <text start="486.61" dur="4.589">solutions they deal with all kinds of</text>
  <text start="489.479" dur="3.25">solutions for people who may have</text>
  <text start="491.199" dur="3.72">problems when they&amp;#39;re dealing with</text>
  <text start="492.729" dur="4.5">nuclear engineering they deal with</text>
  <text start="494.919" dur="4.081">robotics and cleanup and that kind of</text>
  <text start="497.229" dur="3.331">stuff but in particularly I thought it</text>
  <text start="499" dur="3.18">was very interesting the sharp edge labs</text>
  <text start="500.56" dur="3.719">and this immune attrex and of course</text>
  <text start="502.18" dur="4.32">anytime I think about stem cell research</text>
  <text start="504.279" dur="4.621">I think about where they are getting</text>
  <text start="506.5" dur="5.579">their product from and of course that</text>
  <text start="508.9" dur="4.949">led me to my next search now I did this</text>
  <text start="512.079" dur="4.5">search actually from the south side work</text>
  <text start="513.849" dur="5.341">City Club Apartments but as you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="516.579" dur="5.58">as we kind of back up and get a bigger</text>
  <text start="519.19" dur="6.63">picture we can find that right across</text>
  <text start="522.159" dur="6.501">the way over here only two point seven</text>
  <text start="525.82" dur="7.67">miles away is the Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="528.66" dur="4.83">Pittsburgh Family Center</text>
  <text start="533.99" dur="4.69">well surely with this Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="536.699" dur="4.531">there couldn&amp;#39;t be a FedEx print and ship</text>
  <text start="538.68" dur="6.029">center anywhere nearby except for there</text>
  <text start="541.23" dur="6.359">is on the same block and another one</text>
  <text start="544.709" dur="4.56">nearly a mile away up at the top of your</text>
  <text start="547.589" dur="3.451">screen is the Planned Parenthood Center</text>
  <text start="549.269" dur="5.37">and down here is the second location</text>
  <text start="551.04" dur="5.31">FedEx Office Print and Ship Center okay</text>
  <text start="554.639" dur="2.851">so please understand I don&amp;#39;t know that</text>
  <text start="556.35" dur="3.03">these really have anything to do with</text>
  <text start="557.49" dur="4.38">each other I just found those buildings</text>
  <text start="559.38" dur="4.53">next to the apartment very very suspect</text>
  <text start="561.87" dur="3.69">and of course I&amp;#39;ve done a lot in regards</text>
  <text start="563.91" dur="4.95">to this Planned Parenthood their close</text>
  <text start="565.56" dur="6.12">proximity to FedEx and their relation to</text>
  <text start="568.86" dur="5.4">a lot of stem-cell research centers and</text>
  <text start="571.68" dur="4.89">of course this stem-cell procurement</text>
  <text start="574.26" dur="5.16">centers such as a stem express that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
