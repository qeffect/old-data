  <text start="227.92" dur="4.14">shall we play a game can you trust so</text>
  <text start="229.63" dur="4.14">sounds like some deals are going on here</text>
  <text start="232.06" dur="3.06">and folks I would imagine that this is</text>
  <text start="233.77" dur="3">probably some tricky stuff and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="235.12" dur="3.78">know if this is necessarily the molar</text>
  <text start="236.77" dur="4.62">drop that they&amp;#39;re talking about or if</text>
  <text start="238.9" dur="4.78">they&amp;#39;re talking about the the post there</text>

  <text start="250.97" dur="3.359">panicking and it seems like maybe they</text>
  <text start="252.799" dur="3.151">don&amp;#39;t want this investigation to go on</text>
  <text start="254.329" dur="3.331">either maybe they&amp;#39;re gonna let the</text>
  <text start="255.95" dur="4.08">investigation keep on going remember</text>
  <text start="257.66" dur="4.139">it&amp;#39;s not into Trump anymore so will the</text>
  <text start="260.03" dur="4.139">investigation go or will they scrap it</text>
  <text start="261.799" dur="4.981">all and start a new investigation being</text>

  <text start="275.24" dur="4.799">justice and justice was capitalized I</text>
  <text start="277.94" dur="5.16">can&amp;#39;t help but think that usually when Q</text>
  <text start="280.039" dur="4.921">does that it could involve the Justice</text>
  <text start="283.1" dur="7.68">Department so something to think about</text>
  <text start="284.96" dur="7.739">there now in response to this I want to</text>
  <text start="290.78" dur="3.72">move on a little bit because we&amp;#39;ll get</text>
