  <text start="53.71" dur="5.04">get a Twitter status to Todd with Trump</text>
  <text start="56.02" dur="5.52">at tea Heinrich 22 on Twitter who says</text>
  <text start="58.75" dur="4.92">holy poo bar ask the questions that</text>
  <text start="61.54" dur="4.14">needs to be asked what was their agenda</text>
  <text start="63.67" dur="5.04">after the election why did they keep</text>
  <text start="65.68" dur="6.39">pressing for more hashtag vice abuse</text>
  <text start="68.71" dur="5.43">Dale I cheat and steal from hashtag we</text>
  <text start="72.07" dur="4.89">the people and they don&amp;#39;t give a poo</text>
  <text start="74.14" dur="6.06">about us power and control check it out</text>
  <text start="76.96" dur="4.89">but also a few weeks ago I told him that</text>
  <text start="80.2" dur="4.559">he should spend just as much attention</text>
  <text start="81.85" dur="5.73">on the post-election period and I did</text>
  <text start="84.759" dur="5.401">that because of some of the stuff that</text>
  <text start="87.58" dur="5.31">Horowitz has uncovered which to me is an</text>
  <text start="90.16" dur="4.8">explicit such as well what I said is</text>
  <text start="92.89" dur="4.53">their case collapsed after the election</text>
  <text start="94.96" dur="4.62">and they never told the court and they</text>
  <text start="97.42" dur="4.92">kept on getting renewals on these</text>
  <text start="99.58" dur="4.95">applications they first documents</text>
  <text start="102.34" dur="4.889">falsified in order to get these renewals</text>
  <text start="104.53" dur="4.769">there was all kinds of</text>
  <text start="107.229" dur="6.721">withholding of information from the</text>
  <text start="109.299" dur="6.57">court and the question really is what</text>
  <text start="113.95" dur="4.08">was the agenda after the election that</text>
  <text start="115.869" dur="4.081">kept them pressing ahead after their</text>
  <text start="118.03" dur="2.94">case collapsed this is the President of</text>
  <text start="119.95" dur="2.82">the United States</text>
  <text start="120.97" dur="3.569">well pretty fair question to ask right</text>
  <text start="122.77" dur="3.629">but remember the plan never involved</text>
  <text start="124.539" dur="3.811">Hillary Clinton losing she was never</text>
  <text start="126.399" dur="3.901">supposed to lose so it doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="128.35" dur="4.29">really matter if Trump won or if Ted</text>
  <text start="130.3" dur="4.17">Cruz had won or somebody else had won it</text>
  <text start="132.64" dur="4.379">really wouldn&amp;#39;t matter the whole plan</text>
  <text start="134.47" dur="4.32">was for Hillary to win and so anything</text>
  <text start="137.019" dur="4.111">post that is kind of an emergency or</text>
  <text start="138.79" dur="4.199">contingency plan right now you may</text>
  <text start="141.13" dur="3.75">remember this article from Fox News on</text>
  <text start="142.989" dur="3.241">December 20th we&amp;#39;re not gonna go through</text>
  <text start="144.88" dur="3">it all I just want to point out a couple</text>
  <text start="146.23" dur="4.319">of pieces here but it&amp;#39;s entitled fights</text>
  <text start="147.88" dur="5.04">a court judge demands info about FBI</text>
  <text start="150.549" dur="5.491">lawyer linked to Carter page warrant and</text>
  <text start="152.92" dur="6.149">of course the FISA Court judge is judge</text>
  <text start="156.04" dur="4.89">rosemary Collier and the FBI lawyer we</text>
  <text start="159.069" dur="4.321">know to be Kevin Kline Smith who is the</text>
  <text start="160.93" dur="5.49">one who was altering some emails in</text>
  <text start="163.39" dur="5.069">regards to D Carter page FISA warrants</text>
  <text start="166.42" dur="4.68">now remember the FISA warrants are</text>
  <text start="168.459" dur="4.381">foreign intelligence surveillance but</text>
  <text start="171.1" dur="3.87">there was also some domestic</text>
  <text start="172.84" dur="4.41">surveillance going on that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="174.97" dur="4.799">always talk about and rosemary Collier</text>
  <text start="177.25" dur="3.989">was also involved in that it looks like</text>
  <text start="179.769" dur="3.601">she might have looked the other way in</text>
  <text start="181.239" dur="4.171">this in regards to this FISA warrant</text>
  <text start="183.37" dur="4.14">thing which is what&amp;#39;s looking to come to</text>
  <text start="185.41" dur="4.77">light right now and of course she has</text>
  <text start="187.51" dur="4.74">ordered the Justice Department that they</text>
  <text start="190.18" dur="4.08">now have till January 20th to go ahead</text>
  <text start="192.25" dur="3.72">and fix whatever this is or you know</text>
  <text start="194.26" dur="3.63">turn everything over unredacted and</text>
  <text start="195.97" dur="3.96">whatnot but let&amp;#39;s also remember the</text>
  <text start="197.89" dur="4.68">little part of this story let me see if</text>
  <text start="199.93" dur="4.619">I could take you down here where is it</text>
  <text start="202.57" dur="3.81">there it is it was also revealed Friday</text>
  <text start="204.549" dur="4.321">that Collier who is also a senior judge</text>
  <text start="206.38" dur="4.59">on the DC federal court will resign her</text>
  <text start="208.87" dur="4.56">position as presiding judge on the FISA</text>
  <text start="210.97" dur="5.37">Court at the years and her current term</text>
  <text start="213.43" dur="5.58">was set to expire in March 2020</text>
  <text start="216.34" dur="4.649">okay so not only has she ordered that</text>
  <text start="219.01" dur="4.53">everything be turned over in regards to</text>
  <text start="220.989" dur="3.991">this but she&amp;#39;s stepping down herself and</text>
  <text start="223.54" dur="4.349">she&amp;#39;s actually citing health reasons</text>
  <text start="224.98" dur="4.62">which makes it all the more suspect</text>
  <text start="227.889" dur="3.421">right and then it says here Chief</text>
  <text start="229.6" dur="4.169">Justice John Roberts will replace</text>
  <text start="231.31" dur="5.099">Collier with James Bo&amp;#39;s burg a colleague</text>
  <text start="233.769" dur="6.311">a colleague of Collier so I guess I</text>
  <text start="236.409" dur="6.221">would be a colleague anyway</text>
  <text start="240.08" dur="4.65">he was named at the FISA Court in 2014</text>
  <text start="242.63" dur="4.35">and is one of the eleven judges on the</text>
  <text start="244.73" dur="3.66">rotating FISA Court so we&amp;#39;ll see what</text>
  <text start="246.98" dur="3.66">happens with this guy if it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="248.39" dur="3.84">another knucklehead or what not but it</text>
  <text start="250.64" dur="3.6">looks like all the information in</text>
  <text start="252.23" dur="4.86">regards to the Carter Paige situation</text>
  <text start="254.24" dur="4.71">which was one of four FISA warrants is</text>
  <text start="257.09" dur="3.54">starting to bust out and the reason why</text>
  <text start="258.95" dur="3.21">the Carter page1 is so important is</text>
  <text start="260.63" dur="3.69">because like I said this doesn&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="262.16" dur="4.59">reveal foreign intelligence surveillance</text>
  <text start="264.32" dur="3.74">which we know was funky but I think this</text>
  <text start="266.75" dur="4.83">is probably going to reveal some</text>
  <text start="268.06" dur="6.73">domestic surveillance now the same judge</text>
  <text start="271.58" dur="5.49">rosemary Collier she had ordered for any</text>
  <text start="274.79" dur="4.91">intelligence agencies to destroy any</text>
  <text start="277.07" dur="6.12">evidence of illegal domestic</text>
  <text start="279.7" dur="9.46">surveillance anything collected on or</text>
  <text start="283.19" dur="9">before March 17 2017 just keeps turning</text>
  <text start="289.16" dur="4.98">up right so very interesting timing and</text>
  <text start="292.19" dur="5.49">of course a couple days later on March</text>
  <text start="294.14" dur="6.78">20th 2017 was when then FBI director</text>
  <text start="297.68" dur="5.7">Comey began the Trump Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="300.92" dur="3.78">investigation right and this was right</text>
  <text start="303.38" dur="3.87">around the time that Trump was saying</text>
  <text start="304.7" dur="3.96">that he had been wire tapped and of</text>
  <text start="307.25" dur="3.18">course Comey comes out saying we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="308.66" dur="3.33">have any information on that but that</text>
  <text start="310.43" dur="3.42">didn&amp;#39;t seem to be true right there was</text>
  <text start="311.99" dur="3.57">this guy he was sort of an alphabet</text>
  <text start="313.85" dur="4.29">agency contractor he I think he worked</text>
  <text start="315.56" dur="5.88">with all of them CIA FBI whatnot s NSA</text>
  <text start="318.14" dur="5.67">Dennis Montgomery and he said he had 47</text>
  <text start="321.44" dur="4.2">hard drives of information saying that</text>
  <text start="323.81" dur="3.12">Brennan clapper Brennan and clapper knew</text>
  <text start="325.64" dur="2.79">all about this right they would have</text>
  <text start="326.93" dur="4.92">known about the wiretapping at Trump</text>
  <text start="328.43" dur="5.82">Tower all this this was domestic</text>
  <text start="331.85" dur="4.319">surveillance and of course this very</text>
  <text start="334.25" dur="4.26">same judge orders the destroying of all</text>
  <text start="336.169" dur="5.431">this evidence we want to see this stuff</text>
  <text start="338.51" dur="5.04">so where did this go this all was what</text>
  <text start="341.6" dur="3.54">we know as the hammer and we don&amp;#39;t talk</text>
  <text start="343.55" dur="3.3">a lot about it on this channel I know</text>
  <text start="345.14" dur="4.02">other channels go into a great length</text>
  <text start="346.85" dur="4.879">about it but remember this is going to</text>
  <text start="349.16" dur="5.22">reveal foreign intelligence surveillance</text>
  <text start="351.729" dur="5.021">but also domestic surveillance and most</text>
  <text start="354.38" dur="5.61">of this hammer project seemed to be</text>
  <text start="356.75" dur="5.1">aimed at Supreme Court justices and of</text>
  <text start="359.99" dur="4.53">course you know roundabout way to</text>
  <text start="361.85" dur="4.319">president Trump right so this is very</text>
  <text start="364.52" dur="3.09">very important information that we need</text>
  <text start="366.169" dur="3.721">to know and I&amp;#39;m wondering if some of</text>
  <text start="367.61" dur="4.85">this will start to bust as we reveal the</text>
  <text start="369.89" dur="5.6">situation with Carter page</text>
  <text start="372.46" dur="4.77">most 3761 20 minutes after the hour of</text>

  <text start="647.43" dur="3.93">this guy looks like a complete</text>
  <text start="649.38" dur="4.02">knucklehead important name to remember</text>
  <text start="651.36" dur="4.95">former director of the National</text>

  <text start="1013.25" dur="2.82">we all thought that was pretty and</text>
  <text start="1014.48" dur="3.63">curious then right</text>
  <text start="1016.07" dur="4.08">he told NBC that the purpose of his</text>
  <text start="1018.11" dur="3.72">recent travel to the UK and other</text>

  <text start="1027.949" dur="3.421">and this is when they started calling</text>
  <text start="1029.27" dur="3.689">for bars head right and that&amp;#39;s when we</text>
  <text start="1031.37" dur="3.9">started finding out about Durham and of</text>

  <text start="1035.27" dur="4.29">among those Durham interviewed while in</text>
  <text start="1037.55" dur="3.42">London was Terence Dudley according to a</text>

  <text start="1053.33" dur="3.45">not return a request for comment so it</text>
  <text start="1055.49" dur="2.82">looks to me like Bertrand is trying to</text>
  <text start="1056.78" dur="4.08">make the argument that says Haspel</text>
  <text start="1058.31" dur="4.26">passed this all off to the FBI that it</text>
  <text start="1060.86" dur="4.62">must have not been that important and</text>
  <text start="1062.57" dur="4.17">that if Sood was not an asset after all</text>
  <text start="1065.48" dur="4.47">and of course that&amp;#39;s a terrible</text>

  <text start="1071.96" dur="4.58">director for a specific reason we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1073.85" dur="5.46">remember she&amp;#39;s a Russia specialist and</text>
  <text start="1076.54" dur="6.4">she&amp;#39;s got close allies there with mi5</text>
  <text start="1079.31" dur="5.37">mi6 Brennan tapped directly for support</text>
  <text start="1082.94" dur="3.69">yeah they&amp;#39;re connected a couple of</text>
  <text start="1084.68" dur="3.36">different ways right Brennan classified</text>
  <text start="1086.63" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;m assuming this is Security Division</text>
  <text start="1088.04" dur="5.01">and then spy on I&amp;#39;m guessing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1090.47" dur="4.86">Trump Towers we don&amp;#39;t have the first T</text>
  <text start="1093.05" dur="3.45">there may be something Tower but I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="1097.1" dur="5.37">if CIA was running a black ops and then</text>
  <text start="1099.74" dur="6.12">you see it again spy Trump towers in UK</text>
  <text start="1102.47" dur="6.21">would Haspel station chief be informed</text>
  <text start="1105.86" dur="4.65">and instructed yes of course otherwise</text>
  <text start="1108.68" dur="6.87">she would be incompetent right</text>
  <text start="1110.51" dur="6.93">she&amp;#39;s the station chief mi6 meetings</text>
  <text start="1115.55" dur="3.77">with Durham the only way to restore</text>
  <text start="1117.44" dur="4.55">faith is through transparency</text>
  <text start="1119.32" dur="4.41">and accountability indeed so keep in</text>

  <text start="1123.73" dur="4.92">something else in common as not just</text>
  <text start="1126.04" dur="5.52">with this FISA issue but remember that</text>
  <text start="1128.65" dur="5.79">Haspel was the one who got rid of all</text>
  <text start="1131.56" dur="5.16">the evidence of the CIA torture back in</text>
  <text start="1134.44" dur="4.98">the day this was coming out of a black</text>

  <text start="1505.3" dur="4.35">talking about the swamp runs deep only</text>
  <text start="1507.46" dur="6.21">this time it&amp;#39;s not capitalized and we</text>
  <text start="1509.65" dur="5.91">were talking about the DNC server this</text>
  <text start="1513.67" dur="4.62">time we were talking about the DNI NSA</text>

  <text start="1518.29" dur="2.49">deal was going on</text>
  <text start="1519.61" dur="2.939">a lot of people were freaking out about</text>

  <text start="1527.679" dur="4.5">point I&amp;#39;m making is that we see it</text>
  <text start="1529.66" dur="4.5">capitalized sometimes and not others</text>
  <text start="1532.179" dur="3.63">which led me to think I wondered if this</text>
  <text start="1534.16" dur="4.35">was a reference to the Department of</text>
  <text start="1535.809" dur="3.87">Energy and Environmental Protection now</text>

  <text start="1542.5" dur="5.1">heard about it a lot right and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1544.809" dur="5.25">long suspected that some of these doe or</text>

  <text start="1550.059" dur="4.411">up on Twitter from everybody maybe a</text>
  <text start="1552.25" dur="3.87">reference at least offhand to the</text>
  <text start="1554.47" dur="3.36">Department of Energy somehow we have a</text>
  <text start="1556.12" dur="4.049">lot of different ideas and I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1557.83" dur="3.87">to go into that either but that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1560.169" dur="4.441">we have been talking about we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="1561.7" dur="4.32">this from the CIA the FBI the NSA we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1564.61" dur="3.27">seen it from Nunez we&amp;#39;ve seen it from</text>

  <text start="1567.88" dur="3.99">some teeth to this right it&amp;#39;s more than</text>
  <text start="1569.679" dur="4.891">this just being about deer season this</text>
  <text start="1571.87" dur="4.439">seems to be obvious communication but</text>
  <text start="1574.57" dur="3.66">the Department of Energy and</text>

  <text start="1578.23" dur="5.069">what I can see seems to be fairly unique</text>
  <text start="1580.66" dur="4.11">to the state of Connecticut and I found</text>
  <text start="1583.299" dur="4.201">that very interesting because if you</text>
  <text start="1584.77" dur="5.67">remember a while back James nobodies</text>
  <text start="1587.5" dur="5.85">homey Comey had to sell his Connecticut</text>
  <text start="1590.44" dur="4.44">home on the Gold Coast and he lost a</text>
