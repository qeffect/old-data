  <text start="57.98" dur="4.44">something doesn&amp;#39;t look right something</text>
  <text start="59.84" dur="4.68">doesn&amp;#39;t look right we got a little bit</text>
  <text start="62.42" dur="4.8">of cue how much I&amp;#39;m the confident lady</text>
  <text start="64.52" dur="11.1">cast what thank you very much</text>
  <text start="67.22" dur="9.99">shall we begin before we begin I want to</text>
  <text start="75.62" dur="5.66">add something that I failed to mention</text>
  <text start="77.21" dur="6.21">yesterday in regards to post 3593 and 35</text>
  <text start="81.28" dur="3.97">94 kind of casually said they were</text>
  <text start="83.42" dur="4.26">duplicate post and of course the text in</text>
  <text start="85.25" dur="4.47">here was but I failed to mention that</text>
  <text start="87.68" dur="4.71">these were two different links this</text>
  <text start="89.72" dur="4.2">first link in 3593 seemed to be some</text>
  <text start="92.39" dur="4.65">sort of tour length looked like it was</text>
  <text start="93.92" dur="5.19">taking us to the Q research page as you</text>
  <text start="97.04" dur="3.99">can see it can&amp;#39;t be reached anymore it</text>
  <text start="99.11" dur="4.2">couldn&amp;#39;t be reached when I first saw it</text>
  <text start="101.03" dur="4.979">either some people were saying that this</text>
  <text start="103.31" dur="6.21">was linking for them in other browsers</text>
  <text start="106.009" dur="5.731">to Joe Mar suppose Q&amp;#39;s plan to save the</text>
  <text start="109.52" dur="3.9">world video that could be possible I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="111.74" dur="3.3">not sure cuz I was never able to see it</text>
  <text start="113.42" dur="3.69">either way you guys can let me know what</text>
  <text start="115.04" dur="4.109">you found but I failed to mention that</text>
  <text start="117.11" dur="4.22">that wasn&amp;#39;t completely duplicate and</text>
  <text start="119.149" dur="5.341">then of course this second one 35.94</text>
  <text start="121.33" dur="4.929">linked us to a youtube link which I did</text>
  <text start="124.49" dur="4.47">end up showing you so I want to go ahead</text>
  <text start="126.259" dur="8.251">and clarify that now let&amp;#39;s move on to</text>
  <text start="128.96" dur="7.68">our post 3595 raja post 3595 thirty-nine</text>
  <text start="134.51" dur="3.96">minutes after the hour of seven we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="136.64" dur="4.02">got a lot to chew on here I&amp;#39;ll do my</text>
  <text start="138.47" dur="4.98">best with it looks like we are talking</text>
  <text start="140.66" dur="5.64">about Australia Italy UK cooperating</text>
  <text start="143.45" dur="5.49">with the DOJ being bar and Durham</text>
  <text start="146.3" dur="4.44">classified one through four now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="148.94" dur="3.87">gonna assume we&amp;#39;re talking about four</text>
  <text start="150.74" dur="5.13">people it could be documents or I could</text>
  <text start="152.81" dur="5.49">be having to do with the release of the</text>
  <text start="155.87" dur="4.8">IG report but I think we may be talking</text>
  <text start="158.3" dur="4.62">about people here but we have Australia</text>
  <text start="160.67" dur="4.83">Italy in the UK Australia in the UK</text>
  <text start="162.92" dur="5.25">being part of the official five eyes</text>
  <text start="165.5" dur="5.13">Intelligence Group in Italy not so much</text>
  <text start="168.17" dur="5.31">but what we do know is that bar met with</text>
  <text start="170.63" dur="5.25">POTUS right before he left for the rally</text>
  <text start="173.48" dur="4.5">which is actually going on right now but</text>
  <text start="175.88" dur="4.53">either way whatever it caused it caused</text>
  <text start="177.98" dur="4.979">the president to delay his departure and</text>
  <text start="180.41" dur="4.14">Colin McMullan II and some other staff</text>
  <text start="182.959" dur="3.661">members as well as the communications</text>
  <text start="184.55" dur="3.779">team which would suggest to me that they</text>
  <text start="186.62" dur="2.8">would be prepared to release a statement</text>
  <text start="188.329" dur="4.001">whatever there</text>
  <text start="189.42" dur="5.399">doing but we do know also that it looks</text>
  <text start="192.33" dur="4.86">like the Durham Criminal Investigation</text>
  <text start="194.819" dur="5.911">is what has been delaying the release of</text>
  <text start="197.19" dur="6.51">the IG report that seems to be the</text>
  <text start="200.73" dur="6.06">scuttlebutt if you will so looks to me</text>
  <text start="203.7" dur="5.64">like Australia Italy UK probably giving</text>
  <text start="206.79" dur="4.89">some cooperation now we might be getting</text>
  <text start="209.34" dur="4.619">some cooperation with the Ukraine too</text>
  <text start="211.68" dur="5.7">but either way human intelligence signal</text>
  <text start="213.959" dur="5.64">intelligence etc non five eyes official</text>
  <text start="217.38" dur="4.77">channel u.s. senior persons required</text>
  <text start="219.599" dur="5.341">given sensitive nature of target</text>
  <text start="222.15" dur="5.97">regarding presidential nominees and</text>
  <text start="224.94" dur="5.34">remember that it says nominees targeting</text>
  <text start="228.12" dur="3.72">the POTUS plus crews classified one</text>
  <text start="230.28" dur="4.05">through four so again I think we have a</text>
  <text start="231.84" dur="5.25">couple other people here but keep in</text>
  <text start="234.33" dur="4.95">mind before we knew all about the spying</text>
  <text start="237.09" dur="4.53">on the POTUS we knew that this</text>
  <text start="239.28" dur="5.4">originally was the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="241.62" dur="5.64">spying on opposition and that at the</text>
  <text start="244.68" dur="4.17">time the biggest threat was Ted Cruz so</text>
  <text start="247.26" dur="4.8">this is kind of what busted this whole</text>
  <text start="248.85" dur="4.8">thing wide open so and keep in mind too</text>
  <text start="252.06" dur="4.56">that as you spy on somebody they were</text>
  <text start="253.65" dur="5.16">using these these the FISA warrants to</text>
  <text start="256.62" dur="4.32">kind of umbrella surveillance hopping</text>
  <text start="258.81" dur="4.2">from one person to the next meaning that</text>
  <text start="260.94" dur="3.99">your crew and then somebody in your</text>
  <text start="263.01" dur="3.99">crews knows somebody in another crew so</text>
  <text start="264.93" dur="4.38">now we get to make another hop so you</text>
  <text start="267" dur="3.75">end up spying on multiple people well</text>
  <text start="269.31" dur="3.99">who gave the orders I would assume it</text>
  <text start="270.75" dur="4.83">would to be John Brennan who signed I</text>
  <text start="273.3" dur="4.08">would assume that to be James clapper</text>
  <text start="275.58" dur="3.42">multiple people signed on lots of</text>
  <text start="277.38" dur="3.659">different things multiple people signed</text>
  <text start="279" dur="4.71">on these FISA warrants but I&amp;#39;m assuming</text>
  <text start="281.039" dur="5.011">that this all came from John Brennan and</text>
  <text start="283.71" dur="5.28">basically got executed by James clapper</text>
  <text start="286.05" dur="4.05">papered per normal national security no</text>
  <text start="288.99" dur="3.27">not at all that&amp;#39;s what this whole</text>
  <text start="290.1" dur="5.189">thing&amp;#39;s been about comms to and from</text>
  <text start="292.26" dur="5.04">foreign and domestic 4 into 4 and one to</text>
  <text start="295.289" dur="3.261">four US persons well there you go so we</text>
  <text start="297.3" dur="4.5">are probably talking about people here</text>
  <text start="298.55" dur="5.05">initiate this scope memo which of course</text>
  <text start="301.8" dur="5.28">leads us eventually to our special</text>
  <text start="303.6" dur="6.72">counsel UN us scuse me ambassador one</text>
  <text start="307.08" dur="4.8">and two NSA unmask require well who</text>
  <text start="310.32" dur="3.569">would that be that would be Samantha</text>
  <text start="311.88" dur="5.19">Power&amp;#39;s right and of course she was the</text>
  <text start="313.889" dur="5.761">one that was unmasking everybody NSA US</text>
  <text start="317.07" dur="5.159">ambassador one and to Australia Italy</text>
  <text start="319.65" dur="3.17">and UK so it looks like they&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="322.229" dur="2.811">cool</text>
  <text start="322.82" dur="4.95">but probably in the beginning were</text>
  <text start="325.04" dur="5.52">cooperating in the not-so-good way</text>
  <text start="327.77" dur="6.33">special order per directive class one</text>
  <text start="330.56" dur="5.31">through nine authorized unmask per un US</text>
  <text start="334.1" dur="3.99">ambassador okay so it looks like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="335.87" dur="5.01">talking about Samantha Power&amp;#39;s was she</text>
  <text start="338.09" dur="4.58">unmasking nine people maybe this release</text>
  <text start="340.88" dur="4.77">will let us know exactly who they were</text>
  <text start="342.67" dur="5.86">but each unmasking requires approval</text>
  <text start="345.65" dur="4.47">signing key and then again we have two</text>
  <text start="348.53" dur="2.79">brackets there and I&amp;#39;m not really sure</text>
  <text start="350.12" dur="3.27">what that means I&amp;#39;d be curious to see</text>
  <text start="351.32" dur="4.17">what you guys think here but this</text>
  <text start="353.39" dur="4.29">probably has something to do with some</text>
  <text start="355.49" dur="4.26">sort of either forensic or physical</text>
  <text start="357.68" dur="4.56">evidence we may be able to see maybe</text>
  <text start="359.75" dur="5.01">there was a key code required something</text>
  <text start="362.24" dur="4.59">that would be able to show who approved</text>
  <text start="364.76" dur="4.17">what that would be my guess there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="366.83" dur="5.55">probably some sort of physical proof CIA</text>
  <text start="368.93" dur="7.98">domestic asset with rogue FBI to avoid</text>
  <text start="372.38" dur="6.96">US law non-op domestic so yeah we had</text>
  <text start="376.91" dur="4.14">multiple we had multiple plans right we</text>
  <text start="379.34" dur="4.26">had plan to forward of course Paul manna</text>
  <text start="381.05" dur="4.14">four and then of course we&amp;#39;ve got our</text>
  <text start="383.6" dur="3.57">whistleblower who I think we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="385.19" dur="4.5">about here CIA human intelligence</text>
  <text start="387.17" dur="4.02">domestic place placement into the Trump</text>
  <text start="389.69" dur="4.1">campaign well that could have been Paul</text>
  <text start="391.19" dur="4.62">manna for but we have one two three</text>
  <text start="393.79" dur="3.79">jumps and those are those jumps that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="395.81" dur="4.17">talking about so again you&amp;#39;re spying on</text>
  <text start="397.58" dur="3.81">one crew and one guy in that crew is</text>
  <text start="399.98" dur="2.85">talking to somebody else and so now I</text>
  <text start="401.39" dur="3.45">want to spy on that little circle of</text>
  <text start="402.83" dur="4.44">friends too that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="404.84" dur="5.43">about with jumps president Trump ended</text>
  <text start="407.27" dur="4.35">up becoming part of one of those jumps</text>
  <text start="410.27" dur="3.66">and essentially that&amp;#39;s who they really</text>
  <text start="411.62" dur="4.35">really wanted but they needed to do it</text>
  <text start="413.93" dur="4.47">this way I hope that makes sense Trump</text>
  <text start="415.97" dur="4.47">White House spy insertion National</text>
  <text start="418.4" dur="3.42">Security Council well the National</text>
  <text start="420.44" dur="3.27">Security Council would that have been</text>
  <text start="421.82" dur="3.74">under National Security Adviser HR</text>
  <text start="423.71" dur="4.71">McMaster are we talking about our</text>
  <text start="425.56" dur="5.02">quote-unquote whistleblower whose name I</text>
  <text start="428.42" dur="3.93">can&amp;#39;t say but you know even though I</text>
  <text start="430.58" dur="6.06">made a sweet video they got taken down</text>
  <text start="432.35" dur="7.11">twice personal advisers cabinet CIA</text>
  <text start="436.64" dur="4.44">organized under Medea DNI and of course</text>
  <text start="439.46" dur="5.34">Director of National Intelligence was</text>
  <text start="441.08" dur="6.87">James shut your yapper clapper 2010 to</text>
  <text start="444.8" dur="4.74">2017 clapper bulk now I&amp;#39;m assuming when</text>
  <text start="447.95" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re talking about bulk here we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="449.54" dur="4.56">talking about the hosting remember I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="452.33" dur="3.42">said this many many times before and</text>
  <text start="454.1" dur="2.58">although nobody talks about it a lot I</text>
  <text start="455.75" dur="3.3">do think it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="456.68" dur="6.45">in detail to remember under James</text>
  <text start="459.05" dur="6.54">clapper the DNI made a deal with Amazon</text>
  <text start="463.13" dur="3.69">to house their servers that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="465.59" dur="2.579">assuming they&amp;#39;re assuming they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="466.82" dur="2.73">probably talking about bulk there and</text>
  <text start="468.169" dur="4.801">that was a big deal because there were</text>
  <text start="469.55" dur="6.36">other companies involved IBM wanted to</text>
  <text start="472.97" dur="4.979">get a bid on that I can&amp;#39;t imagine any</text>
  <text start="475.91" dur="4.44">really company that was able to do</text>
  <text start="477.949" dur="4.381">wouldn&amp;#39;t want to do it but a bunch of</text>
  <text start="480.35" dur="4.68">companies were trying to vie for this</text>
  <text start="482.33" dur="4.11">cloud storage and normally what the US</text>
  <text start="485.03" dur="2.97">government would do would be kind of</text>
  <text start="486.44" dur="3.96">split it up against the you know amongst</text>
  <text start="488" dur="4.65">a few companies so that it would be at</text>
  <text start="490.4" dur="4.71">least a little bit fair but they took an</text>
  <text start="492.65" dur="4.019">exclusive deal with Amazon of course</text>
  <text start="495.11" dur="4.44">Amazon&amp;#39;s Jeff Bezos</text>
  <text start="496.669" dur="6.09">Jeff Bezos is also the Washington Post</text>
  <text start="499.55" dur="4.679">and clapper is known for leaking so I</text>
  <text start="502.759" dur="3.181">think you can imagine how this all</text>
  <text start="504.229" dur="4.081">worked everything was being housed by</text>
  <text start="505.94" dur="4.83">the Amazon servers so of course</text>
  <text start="508.31" dur="3.96">Washington Post would have access to all</text>
  <text start="510.77" dur="4.439">these servers and that&amp;#39;s a pretty</text>
  <text start="512.27" dur="6.23">important detail especially considering</text>
  <text start="515.209" dur="8.13">how much the Washington Post hates Trump</text>
  <text start="518.5" dur="7.87">2017 to 2019 dan coates sleeper prevent</text>
  <text start="523.339" dur="4.921">black op release of incriminating docs</text>
  <text start="526.37" dur="3.75">yeah this is the curious thing about</text>
  <text start="528.26" dur="4.65">Coates because I don&amp;#39;t think if any of</text>
  <text start="530.12" dur="6">this really had busted wide open I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="532.91" dur="5.19">know if we would have known where Coates</text>
  <text start="536.12" dur="4.53">loyalties lied you know what I mean I</text>
  <text start="538.1" dur="4.47">think that we probably would have slept</text>
  <text start="540.65" dur="3.809">on him had we not known about all this</text>
  <text start="542.57" dur="3.9">but we&amp;#39;ve seen through this process that</text>
  <text start="544.459" dur="4.171">he&amp;#39;s been kind of installed to make sure</text>
  <text start="546.47" dur="4.2">that this stuff doesn&amp;#39;t come out and</text>
  <text start="548.63" dur="3.93">that&amp;#39;s why we haven&amp;#39;t seen the bacony</text>
  <text start="550.67" dur="4.26">cheesy goodness and that&amp;#39;s why we</text>
  <text start="552.56" dur="5.01">haven&amp;#39;t seen the IG report and perhaps</text>
  <text start="554.93" dur="5.07">this is the C before D maybe we needed</text>
  <text start="557.57" dur="4.41">to deal with coats first and of course</text>
  <text start="560" dur="4.05">once coats was released we kind of saw</text>
  <text start="561.98" dur="5.28">his true colors right so it looks like</text>
  <text start="564.05" dur="5.25">he was another blockade installed we may</text>
  <text start="567.26" dur="4.05">never have known about it had we not</text>
  <text start="569.3" dur="6.12">found out about the spying in the first</text>
  <text start="571.31" dur="6.18">place that is your cue for now let me</text>
  <text start="575.42" dur="4.65">take you over to this story from CBS Los</text>

  <text start="684.64" dur="5.85">I feel the need to point it out now</text>
