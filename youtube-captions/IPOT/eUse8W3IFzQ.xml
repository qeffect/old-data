  <text start="100.679" dur="3.3">so I&amp;#39;m back and I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="102.119" dur="4.621">some things today I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="103.979" dur="5.67">what we had just happened yesterday of</text>
  <text start="106.74" dur="7.64">course which was the death of Abu Bakr</text>
  <text start="109.649" dur="4.731">al-baghdadi so let&amp;#39;s do it</text>
  <text start="117.81" dur="6.67">so as most of you already know head of</text>
  <text start="120.61" dur="6.54">Isis Abu Bakr al Baghdadi but you can</text>
  <text start="124.48" dur="5.46">just call him Al was killed in a US raid</text>
  <text start="127.15" dur="5.13">indeed big news and POTUS said yesterday</text>
  <text start="129.94" dur="4.38">that he had some big news and then later</text>
  <text start="132.28" dur="3.96">followed it up with a press conference a</text>
  <text start="134.32" dur="4.02">very revealing press conference some of</text>
  <text start="136.24" dur="4.05">it I want to share with you today I want</text>
  <text start="138.34" dur="4.95">to add a little commentary along the way</text>
  <text start="140.29" dur="5.01">I found a few different interesting</text>
  <text start="143.29" dur="4.5">talking points in regards to this and I</text>
  <text start="145.3" dur="3.93">think that this is big news for a few</text>
  <text start="147.79" dur="3.12">different reasons so I want to give a</text>
  <text start="149.23" dur="4.98">little bit of that perspective but</text>
  <text start="150.91" dur="5.37">indeed big news so let&amp;#39;s go to the</text>
  <text start="154.21" dur="3.63">speech and break it down between trying</text>
  <text start="156.28" dur="9.83">to watch the whole thing I made you a</text>
  <text start="157.84" dur="11.04">montage last night the United States</text>
  <text start="166.11" dur="8.8">brought the world&amp;#39;s number-one terrorist</text>
  <text start="168.88" dur="9.87">leader to justice Abu Bakar al Baghdadi</text>
  <text start="174.91" dur="6.66">is dead he was the founder and leader of</text>
  <text start="178.75" dur="4.98">Isis the most ruthless and violent</text>
  <text start="181.57" dur="4.5">terror organization anywhere in the</text>
  <text start="183.73" dur="4.979">world he died after running into a</text>
  <text start="186.07" dur="6.63">dead-end tunnel whimpering and crying</text>
  <text start="188.709" dur="6.931">and screaming all the way the compound</text>
  <text start="192.7" dur="5.49">had been cleared by this time with</text>
  <text start="195.64" dur="6.72">people either surrendering or being shot</text>
  <text start="198.19" dur="8.82">and killed 11 young children were moved</text>
  <text start="202.36" dur="8.82">out of the house and are uninjured the</text>
  <text start="207.01" dur="8.52">only ones remaining were Baghdady in the</text>
  <text start="211.18" dur="7.82">tunnel and he had dragged three of his</text>
  <text start="215.53" dur="7.35">young children with him</text>
  <text start="219" dur="6.43">they were led to certain death he</text>
  <text start="222.88" dur="8.46">reached the end of the tunnel as our</text>
  <text start="225.43" dur="9.089">dogs chased him down he ignited his vest</text>
  <text start="231.34" dur="5.79">killing himself and the three children</text>
  <text start="234.519" dur="4.951">okay so big story here and although we</text>
  <text start="237.13" dur="4.74">have a relatively happy ending for now</text>
  <text start="239.47" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s quite sad to think that this man</text>
  <text start="241.87" dur="5.01">dragged three of his own children and</text>
  <text start="244.42" dur="4.59">chose their fate for them at the same</text>
  <text start="246.88" dur="2.85">time it&amp;#39;s nice to know that 11 children</text>
  <text start="249.01" dur="2.19">were</text>
  <text start="249.73" dur="4.2">move from the compound and hopefully</text>
  <text start="251.2" dur="5.189">we&amp;#39;ll be safe but this there&amp;#39;s a lot to</text>
  <text start="253.93" dur="5.19">unpack here and here&amp;#39;s this guy out</text>
  <text start="256.389" dur="4.56">Baghdadi who was incredibly influential</text>
  <text start="259.12" dur="4.41">president Trump even argued in this</text>
  <text start="260.949" dur="4.651">conference here that he thought even</text>
  <text start="263.53" dur="4.62">more so than Osama bin Laden now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="265.6" dur="4.65">the debatable of course but either way a</text>
  <text start="268.15" dur="5.4">big big deal this guy was responsible</text>
  <text start="270.25" dur="5.79">for the growth and cultivating of which</text>
  <text start="273.55" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;re calling Isis around the world and</text>
  <text start="276.04" dur="4.68">this guy had a lot of coin that was</text>
  <text start="278.02" dur="4.5">supporting him so big big deal for quite</text>
  <text start="280.72" dur="3.6">a few reasons but of course an</text>
  <text start="282.52" dur="4.619">incredibly sad story about his own</text>
  <text start="284.32" dur="4.62">children and definitely a violent end I</text>
  <text start="287.139" dur="3.631">thought it was very very interesting the</text>
  <text start="288.94" dur="5.099">way President Trump spoke I thought it</text>
  <text start="290.77" dur="4.92">was a quite presidential and he made the</text>
  <text start="294.039" dur="3.6">point to really point out that how</text>
  <text start="295.69" dur="4.05">cowardly this guy died because people</text>
  <text start="297.639" dur="3.961">will be watching and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="299.74" dur="3.87">politics being played here but</text>
  <text start="301.6" dur="4.289">interesting stuff and this is the first</text>
  <text start="303.61" dur="3.69">time that he mentions the dogs now in</text>
  <text start="305.889" dur="3.481">this particular case he mentioned</text>
  <text start="307.3" dur="4.11">multiple dogs even though one ends up</text>
  <text start="309.37" dur="3.63">being an injured but I want to turn your</text>
  <text start="311.41" dur="4.319">attention to the fact that he kept</text>
  <text start="313" dur="6.21">calling attention to the dogs our reach</text>
  <text start="315.729" dur="6.481">is very long as you know last month we</text>
  <text start="319.21" dur="4.8">announced that we recently killed hamza</text>
  <text start="322.21" dur="5.37">bin Laden so you may remember back in</text>
  <text start="324.01" dur="6.39">2011 on the raid in Pakistan on Osama</text>
  <text start="327.58" dur="4.98">bin Laden that they had also killed one</text>
  <text start="330.4" dur="4.71">of the sons and they initially reported</text>
  <text start="332.56" dur="4.919">it to be hamza that was coming from john</text>
  <text start="335.11" dur="4.11">brennan himself he went out and did a</text>
  <text start="337.479" dur="4.081">little press conference himself now</text>
  <text start="339.22" dur="5.1">later they changed that and said that it</text>
  <text start="341.56" dur="4.89">was his brother khaled to have been</text>
  <text start="344.32" dur="4.68">killed and it was Pakistani Intel that</text>
  <text start="346.45" dur="4.86">said that one of the sons got away and</text>
  <text start="349" dur="4.5">evidently that would have been Hamza now</text>
  <text start="351.31" dur="4.289">Pakistani Intel that</text>
  <text start="353.5" dur="4.41">that they had captured him and his</text>
  <text start="355.599" dur="4.621">half-brother Saud this was back in the</text>
  <text start="357.91" dur="4.14">day also so it&amp;#39;s hard to really know</text>
  <text start="360.22" dur="3.69">what happened when this guy died I just</text>
  <text start="362.05" dur="4.11">want to point that out I want to point</text>
  <text start="363.91" dur="4.05">out that it had been reported initially</text>
  <text start="366.16" dur="3.27">by John Brennan and that had been</text>
  <text start="367.96" dur="2.82">changed but there are a couple of</text>
  <text start="369.43" dur="3.15">brothers there&amp;#39;s Omar</text>
  <text start="370.78" dur="3.96">there&amp;#39;s Khaled and there&amp;#39;s Hamza and</text>
  <text start="372.58" dur="3.78">Omar&amp;#39;s really been the only one that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="374.74" dur="3.84">come out saying that he didn&amp;#39;t agree</text>
  <text start="376.36" dur="3.72">with his father but as far as Colette</text>
  <text start="378.58" dur="4.019">and hamza they built both been pretty</text>
  <text start="380.08" dur="3.12">militant and hubs that has been largely</text>
  <text start="382.599" dur="3.061">regarded</text>
  <text start="383.2" dur="6.17">as the guy sort of taking over Baghdady</text>
  <text start="385.66" dur="7.32">and the losers who worked for him and</text>
  <text start="389.37" dur="7.27">losers they are they had no idea what</text>
  <text start="392.98" dur="7.74">they were getting into in some cases</text>
  <text start="396.64" dur="7.47">they were very frightened puppies in</text>
  <text start="400.72" dur="6.62">other cases they were hardcore killers</text>
  <text start="404.11" dur="5.48">wait a minute did you just say</text>
  <text start="407.34" dur="5.75">frightened puppies</text>

  <text start="567.3" dur="4.11">mentioned back then we were talking</text>
  <text start="568.77" dur="4.11">about spider webs and you can see</text>
  <text start="571.41" dur="3.21">there&amp;#39;s kind of the spider web looking</text>
  <text start="572.88" dur="3.54">thingies behind them you can see it</text>
  <text start="574.62" dur="3.81">better here somebody highlighted it and</text>
  <text start="576.42" dur="5.13">cue it actually confirmed what we had</text>
  <text start="578.43" dur="4.5">suspected was that even though this was</text>
  <text start="581.55" dur="2.85">you can&amp;#39;t see it here it said in the</text>
  <text start="582.93" dur="4.89">arabic above though but this was like a</text>
  <text start="584.4" dur="5.58">welcoming center and this was actually</text>
  <text start="587.82" dur="4.53">showing people that there was a WebWork</text>

  <text start="592.35" dur="3.87">that even though it doesn&amp;#39;t look exactly</text>
  <text start="593.97" dur="3.87">like spider webs that was sort of the</text>
  <text start="596.22" dur="2.97">meaning that they were wanting to show</text>
  <text start="597.84" dur="3.12">people who actually knew how to read</text>
  <text start="599.19" dur="3.75">that that there was a network of tunnels</text>
  <text start="600.96" dur="3.39">and that could likely be accessed here</text>
  <text start="602.94" dur="2.88">and of course Trump was just talking</text>
  <text start="604.35" dur="4.5">about how he knew about these tunnels</text>
  <text start="605.82" dur="7.17">likely because of John McCain and Abu</text>

  <text start="677.37" dur="4.53">being john mccain&amp;#39;s should know better</text>
  <text start="679.62" dur="5.76">so likely some of this info came from</text>
  <text start="681.9" dur="9.57">John McCain&amp;#39;s phone himself and we</text>
  <text start="685.38" dur="8.55">watched it so clearly I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="691.47" dur="4.53">say how but we had absolutely perfect as</text>
  <text start="693.93" dur="3.54">though you were watching a movie just</text>
  <text start="696" dur="2.82">like a movie</text>
  <text start="697.47" dur="3.03">indeed I think many of you would agree</text>
  <text start="698.82" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s starting to feel that way</text>
  <text start="700.5" dur="4.5">especially as of late for those you not</text>
  <text start="703.32" dur="3.93">catching the reference queuing on has</text>
  <text start="705" dur="4.59">also referenced watching a movie time</text>
  <text start="707.25" dur="4.5">and time again I just typed in on cue</text>
  <text start="709.59" dur="3.69">map here the search word movie and you</text>
  <text start="711.75" dur="3.18">can see all the different times it has</text>
  <text start="713.28" dur="3.45">come up we&amp;#39;re not gonna cover all these</text>
  <text start="714.93" dur="3.69">but you can see it highlighted in red</text>
  <text start="716.73" dur="4.35">here but indeed queuing on has been</text>
  <text start="718.62" dur="5.13">talking about watching a movie actors</text>
  <text start="721.08" dur="4.68">all of us playing out just like a movie</text>
  <text start="723.75" dur="5.64">and like I said it is playing out just</text>
  <text start="725.76" dur="6.48">like a movie and of course Q plus being</text>
  <text start="729.39" dur="6.03">the POTUS had something to say about his</text>
  <text start="732.24" dur="5.97">prowess on the interwebs you know these</text>
  <text start="735.42" dur="4.68">people are very smart they&amp;#39;re not into</text>
  <text start="738.21" dur="4.35">the use of cellphones anymore they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="740.1" dur="5.4">not they&amp;#39;re very technically brilliant</text>
  <text start="742.56" dur="5.1">you know they use the internet better</text>
  <text start="745.5" dur="3.96">than almost anybody in the world perhaps</text>
  <text start="747.66" dur="4.98">other than Donald Trump they should see</text>
  <text start="749.46" dur="6.6">how he died he didn&amp;#39;t die a hero he died</text>
  <text start="752.64" dur="6.75">a coward crying whimpering screaming and</text>
  <text start="756.06" dur="5.7">bringing three kids with him to die</text>
  <text start="759.39" dur="5.61">certain death but many were killed</text>
  <text start="761.76" dur="8.31">we lost nobody think of that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="765" dur="9.54">incredible our dog was hurt actually the</text>
  <text start="770.07" dur="7.86">the canine was hurt went into the tunnel</text>
  <text start="774.54" dur="4.83">but we lost nobody there it is again now</text>
  <text start="777.93" dur="3.15">I want to point out he thought about it</text>
  <text start="779.37" dur="3.45">for a second and made sure to bring it</text>
  <text start="781.08" dur="3.54">up of course it&amp;#39;s the right thing to do</text>
  <text start="782.82" dur="3.12">anyway even if it were a service dog</text>
  <text start="784.62" dur="4.38">just being injured I think that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="785.94" dur="5.64">classy thing to do but knowing what we</text>
  <text start="789" dur="5.07">know about all these dog references over</text>
  <text start="791.58" dur="4.98">the last couple years and much of the</text>
  <text start="794.07" dur="4.2">started remember with Senator McCain who</text>
  <text start="796.56" dur="3.18">died on dog day</text>
  <text start="798.27" dur="2.85">now I don&amp;#39;t have enough time to go</text>
  <text start="799.74" dur="2.91">through this or explain it to you or</text>
  <text start="801.12" dur="2.61">even try to prove it to you or anything</text>
  <text start="802.65" dur="3.18">like that there&amp;#39;s people that neither</text>
  <text start="803.73" dur="2.42">love my ideas or hate them but the fact</text>
  <text start="805.83" dur="1.82">of the</text>
  <text start="806.15" dur="3.39">matter is that everyone seems to be</text>
  <text start="807.65" dur="5.01">bringing it up and we&amp;#39;re going right</text>
  <text start="809.54" dur="5.64">back to all this dog discussion I will</text>
  <text start="812.66" dur="4.59">leave you the thread with all my videos</text>
  <text start="815.18" dur="5.85">covering that but unless you&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="817.25" dur="5.94">those videos don&amp;#39;t come at me let&amp;#39;s move</text>
  <text start="821.03" dur="4.32">on and that was to notify you guys that</text>
  <text start="823.19" dur="4.38">you have something big this morning so</text>
  <text start="825.35" dur="5.73">you wouldn&amp;#39;t be out playing golf or</text>
  <text start="827.57" dur="5.82">tennis or otherwise being indisposed</text>
  <text start="831.08" dur="4.47">Trump has to be loving this for so many</text>
  <text start="833.39" dur="5.07">reasons and I can&amp;#39;t say I blame him</text>
  <text start="835.55" dur="4.98">considering what he has endured but that</text>
  <text start="838.46" dur="4.26">to me look like a direct shot to all the</text>
  <text start="840.53" dur="4.56">haters who have complained about all his</text>
  <text start="842.72" dur="4.77">time on the golf course I thought it was</text>
  <text start="845.09" dur="4.32">absolutely beautiful and like I said he</text>
  <text start="847.49" dur="3.48">has to really be enjoying himself in</text>
  <text start="849.41" dur="3.42">this moment we want to be home</text>
  <text start="850.97" dur="3.75">I want our soldiers home or fighting</text>
  <text start="852.83" dur="5.67">something that&amp;#39;s meaningful I&amp;#39;ll tell</text>
  <text start="854.72" dur="7.38">you who loves us being there Russia and</text>
  <text start="858.5" dur="5.88">China because while they build their</text>
  <text start="862.1" dur="2.84">military we&amp;#39;re depleting our military</text>
  <text start="864.38" dur="3.18">there</text>
  <text start="864.94" dur="4.33">so Russia loves us being there now</text>
  <text start="867.56" dur="5.58">Russia likes us being there for two</text>
  <text start="869.27" dur="6.21">reasons because we kill Isis we kill</text>
  <text start="873.14" dur="3.5">terrorists and they&amp;#39;re very close to</text>
  <text start="875.48" dur="4.29">Russia</text>
  <text start="876.64" dur="5.23">we&amp;#39;re 8,000 miles away not only are both</text>
  <text start="879.77" dur="4.08">of those things true but this is super</text>
  <text start="881.87" dur="3.93">beautiful in the fact that to all the</text>
  <text start="883.85" dur="4.5">people who have claimed that he was a</text>
  <text start="885.8" dur="4.5">puppet of Russia he just clearly</text>
  <text start="888.35" dur="3.78">demonstrated here that he is putting</text>
  <text start="890.3" dur="4.32">them in charge and putting their feet to</text>
  <text start="892.13" dur="4.65">the fire in this situation so I find it</text>
  <text start="894.62" dur="5.7">very very hard to continue to critique</text>
  <text start="896.78" dur="6.33">him on that particular case also this is</text>
  <text start="900.32" dur="5.67">an in-your-face to telecine gabbard who</text>
  <text start="903.11" dur="5.37">basically said he was a B word right in</text>
  <text start="905.99" dur="5.49">regards to this situation he basically</text>
  <text start="908.48" dur="4.59">shows him exactly what&amp;#39;s up and the most</text>
  <text start="911.48" dur="3.24">important part is he&amp;#39;s bringing troops</text>
  <text start="913.07" dur="4.56">home which was what we all really do</text>
  <text start="914.72" dur="4.92">want it&amp;#39;s what most Democrats want I</text>
  <text start="917.63" dur="2.88">think it&amp;#39;s what most Americans truly</text>
  <text start="919.64" dur="4.05">truly want</text>
  <text start="920.51" dur="4.92">so again win win and in your face to all</text>
  <text start="923.69" dur="3.78">the haters in all directions</text>
  <text start="925.43" dur="3.78">yeah we thought for three days this is</text>
  <text start="927.47" dur="5.79">what was going to happen it was actually</text>
  <text start="929.21" dur="7.65">look nobody was even hurt Arcanine as</text>
  <text start="933.26" dur="5.99">they call I call it a dog a beautiful</text>
  <text start="936.86" dur="7.37">dog a talented dog</text>
  <text start="939.25" dur="7.32">was injured and brought back but we had</text>
  <text start="944.23" dur="5.73">no soldier injured sounds a little bit</text>
  <text start="946.57" dur="12.42">like an in-your-face to some my haters</text>
  <text start="949.96" dur="11.13">yeah well we don&amp;#39;t know that but he was</text>
  <text start="958.99" dur="4.77">the last one out and his people had</text>
  <text start="961.09" dur="7.74">either been killed which there were many</text>
  <text start="963.76" dur="6.87">or gave up and came out because with the</text>
  <text start="968.83" dur="5.67">eleven children that came out we were</text>
  <text start="970.63" dur="5.36">able to do that we don&amp;#39;t know if they</text>
  <text start="974.5" dur="4.11">were his children they might have been</text>
  <text start="975.99" dur="4.57">but as I said three died in the tunnel</text>
  <text start="978.61" dur="5.52">and the tunnel collapsed with the</text>
  <text start="980.56" dur="5.28">explosion but but you had other fighters</text>
  <text start="984.13" dur="4.44">coming out also and they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="985.84" dur="5.04">brought back they&amp;#39;re being there right</text>
  <text start="988.57" dur="4.17">now we have them imprisoned so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="990.88" dur="3.39">little bit of the skinny right there I</text>
  <text start="992.74" dur="3.66">imagine we&amp;#39;re gonna get more press</text>
  <text start="994.27" dur="4.8">conferences in particular with some of</text>
  <text start="996.4" dur="4.77">our military personnel over the next 72</text>
  <text start="999.07" dur="5.07">hours so it should be interesting to</text>
  <text start="1001.17" dur="4.77">find out how this all played out but let</text>
  <text start="1004.14" dur="3.66">me just have POTUS sum it up for you I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1005.94" dur="4.41">writing a book World Trade Center had</text>
  <text start="1007.8" dur="3.99">not come down I think it was about if</text>
  <text start="1010.35" dur="3.9">your check was about a year before the</text>
  <text start="1011.79" dur="4.77">World Trade Center came down and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1014.25" dur="4.32">saying to people take out Osama bin</text>
  <text start="1016.56" dur="3.39">Laden that nobody ever heard of nobody</text>
  <text start="1018.57" dur="3.05">ever heard of I mean al Baghdady</text>
  <text start="1019.95" dur="5.52">everybody hears cuz he&amp;#39;s built this</text>
  <text start="1021.62" dur="6.4">monster for a long time but nobody ever</text>
  <text start="1025.47" dur="6.27">heard of Osama bin Laden until really</text>
  <text start="1028.02" dur="5.1">the World Trade Center but about a year</text>
  <text start="1031.74" dur="2.76">you&amp;#39;ll have to check at a year year and</text>
  <text start="1033.12" dur="2.91">a half before the World Trade Center</text>
  <text start="1034.5" dur="3.3">Kindra the book came out I was talking</text>
  <text start="1036.03" dur="3.9">about Osama bin Laden I said you have to</text>
  <text start="1037.8" dur="5.399">kill him you have to take him out nobody</text>
  <text start="1039.93" dur="5.639">listened to me he was an animal and he</text>
  <text start="1043.199" dur="2.821">was a gutless animal thank you all very</text>
  <text start="1045.569" dur="1.621">much</text>
  <text start="1046.02" dur="6.719">I appreciate it</text>
  <text start="1047.19" dur="5.549">[Music]</text>
  <text start="1053.34" dur="5.38">so there you go like I said a massive</text>
  <text start="1056.53" dur="4.41">win for president Trump on so many</text>
  <text start="1058.72" dur="5.46">fronts he really addresses so many</text>
  <text start="1060.94" dur="5.22">haters in this move and in this wind now</text>
  <text start="1064.18" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s very very possible this could have</text>
  <text start="1066.16" dur="4.11">happened a long time ago and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1068.41" dur="4.23">been holding this in their back pocket</text>
  <text start="1070.27" dur="3.72">for the sake of kind of showing this</text>
  <text start="1072.64" dur="3.18">pulling this out at the right time</text>
  <text start="1073.99" dur="4.11">letting everybody get real hawkish on</text>
  <text start="1075.82" dur="4.11">this situation only to show that that</text>
  <text start="1078.1" dur="3.99">was the case I don&amp;#39;t know it does seem</text>
  <text start="1079.93" dur="5.01">like there was actual activity out there</text>
  <text start="1082.09" dur="4.2">so it could have just been kismet timing</text>
  <text start="1084.94" dur="3.3">and maybe they were just ready to pull</text>
  <text start="1086.29" dur="3.99">the trigger but there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="1088.24" dur="4.38">possibilities here but either way it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1090.28" dur="4.59">big big win for president Trump and</text>
  <text start="1092.62" dur="4.74">Democrats hate that as you can see they</text>
  <text start="1094.87" dur="4.23">say here on CNN President Trump says the</text>
  <text start="1097.36" dur="4.11">White House didn&amp;#39;t inform some key</text>
  <text start="1099.1" dur="4.14">Democrats about the raid resulting in</text>
  <text start="1101.47" dur="4.41">the death of Isis leader Abu Bakr</text>
  <text start="1103.24" dur="6">al-baghdadi or I didn&amp;#39;t know that they</text>
  <text start="1105.88" dur="5.43">had to let you know about that the move</text>
  <text start="1109.24" dur="4.05">to not make notable leaders aware goes</text>
  <text start="1111.31" dur="4.05">against the usual tradition for such</text>
  <text start="1113.29" dur="4.23">high-profile operations and oddly enough</text>
  <text start="1115.36" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;ve gotten the antsy pants Bulow&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1117.52" dur="3.78">he pictured right there who just</text>
  <text start="1118.81" dur="4.92">recently took a trip to Jordan did you</text>
  <text start="1121.3" dur="5.01">let anybody know about that trip to</text>
  <text start="1123.73" dur="5.28">Jordan right before all this went down</text>
  <text start="1126.31" dur="5.82">Nancy no probably not</text>
  <text start="1129.01" dur="5.01">anyway this is absolutely beautiful so</text>
  <text start="1132.13" dur="4.17">if they were hawkish about the Russia</text>
  <text start="1134.02" dur="4.5">thing that narrative gotta get squashed</text>
  <text start="1136.3" dur="5.01">too because like I said President Trump</text>
  <text start="1138.52" dur="4.83">is backing out to hold not only Russia</text>
  <text start="1141.31" dur="3.96">but Turkey responsible for this whole</text>
  <text start="1143.35" dur="3.57">situation which is really essentially</text>
  <text start="1145.27" dur="3.51">what we want like you said they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1146.92" dur="3.93">fighting out there for so long there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1148.78" dur="4.08">no real reason for us to be out there</text>
  <text start="1150.85" dur="5.04">now it&amp;#39;s been suggested that his</text>
  <text start="1152.86" dur="5.4">announcement of this withdrawal likely</text>
  <text start="1155.89" dur="4.08">could have drawn out people that led</text>
  <text start="1158.26" dur="3.18">them you know to this raid I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1159.97" dur="2.01">really know I don&amp;#39;t know that we will</text>
  <text start="1161.44" dur="2.58">ever know</text>
  <text start="1161.98" dur="3.96">and strategically I can&amp;#39;t imagine why</text>
  <text start="1164.02" dur="3.09">anybody would ever want to tell you</text>
  <text start="1165.94" dur="3.75">wouldn&amp;#39;t want to give that sort of thing</text>
  <text start="1167.11" dur="4.47">away so we can only speculate but either</text>
  <text start="1169.69" dur="3.48">way it&amp;#39;s a win-win for the Hawks on</text>
  <text start="1171.58" dur="4.08">Russia like I said it&amp;#39;s an in-your-face</text>
  <text start="1173.17" dur="4.26">to Tulsi Gabbard who was particularly</text>
  <text start="1175.66" dur="4.56">thinking that he was going to fold on</text>
  <text start="1177.43" dur="4.349">this and we&amp;#39;re getting the really the</text>
  <text start="1180.22" dur="3.029">desired result that we would really</text>
  <text start="1181.779" dur="4.38">this is the best thing that we could</text>
  <text start="1183.249" dur="5.13">probably achieve from this situation of</text>
  <text start="1186.159" dur="4.5">course that doesn&amp;#39;t make Democrats happy</text>
  <text start="1188.379" dur="5.18">how does Lindsey Graham feel about this</text>
  <text start="1190.659" dur="6.27">I think last night the best of America</text>
  <text start="1193.559" dur="6.37">confronted the worst of mankind and the</text>
  <text start="1196.929" dur="7.5">good guys won the good guys and the good</text>

  <text start="1204.429" dur="6.75">the name of the dog pray for the dog it</text>
  <text start="1207.519" dur="5.671">was severely injured but it just reminds</text>
  <text start="1211.179" dur="4.38">me of the team concept of the military</text>
  <text start="1213.19" dur="4.38">yeah it seems really concerned about the</text>
  <text start="1215.559" dur="5.49">dog for some reason wants to know who</text>
  <text start="1217.57" dur="5.819">the dog is and how the dog is yeah well</text>
  <text start="1221.049" dur="3.72">look I&amp;#39;m a dog lover so of course I will</text>
  <text start="1223.389" dur="2.821">be concerned about the dog too and</text>
  <text start="1224.769" dur="3.9">hopefully we&amp;#39;ll get some good news about</text>
  <text start="1226.21" dur="5.219">the dog but again there&amp;#39;s that dog</text>
  <text start="1228.669" dur="5.58">reference again and it seems like much</text>
  <text start="1231.429" dur="5.011">more of a dog whistle to me Lindsey</text>
  <text start="1234.249" dur="5.22">Graham seems to want to know who the dog</text>
  <text start="1236.44" dur="5.189">is and how the dog is seems really</text>
  <text start="1239.469" dur="4.17">concerned about the dog seems really</text>
  <text start="1241.629" dur="4.65">concerned in general ever since</text>
  <text start="1243.639" dur="5.46">Durham announced that he was launching a</text>

  <text start="1445.6" dur="2.94">it&amp;#39;s really more offensive to dogs than</text>

  <text start="1448.54" dur="3.27">the fact of the matter is is that Trump</text>

  <text start="1451.81" dur="4.56">definitely sending a message this is</text>

  <text start="1458.26" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re offended the fact of the matter</text>
  <text start="1459.94" dur="4.02">is is that they were taking away face</text>
  <text start="1462.4" dur="2.88">remember this is all about the Middle</text>
  <text start="1463.96" dur="3.45">East it&amp;#39;s a completely different culture</text>

  <text start="1467.41" dur="5.67">this you were showing them an ultimate</text>
  <text start="1469.54" dur="5.13">disrespect but it works and the reason</text>
  <text start="1473.08" dur="2.97">why it works is because all those young</text>
  <text start="1474.67" dur="3.27">little knuckleheads that are trying to</text>
  <text start="1476.05" dur="3.42">get radicalized are not really sure what</text>
  <text start="1477.94" dur="2.64">to do with their lives they&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="1479.47" dur="4.47">something like this and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1480.58" dur="5.67">think well maybe I&amp;#39;m not so sure and it</text>
  <text start="1483.94" dur="3.87">does have an effect it was effective</text>
  <text start="1486.25" dur="3.74">they know what Trump knows that I know</text>
  <text start="1487.81" dur="4.23">it now you know it too</text>
  <text start="1489.99" dur="5.26">there&amp;#39;s an interesting update from</text>
