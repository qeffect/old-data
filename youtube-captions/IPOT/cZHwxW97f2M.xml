  <text start="79.24" dur="3.36">fine not not necessarily good or bad</text>
  <text start="81.37" dur="2.88">either way I just you know wanted to</text>
  <text start="82.6" dur="4.44">call it out anyway a couple of days ago</text>
  <text start="84.25" dur="5.01">I stated that I didn&amp;#39;t think that former</text>
  <text start="87.04" dur="3.96">ambassador to Ukraine Marija Voinovich</text>
  <text start="89.26" dur="4.02">would end up speaking I just had a</text>
  <text start="91" dur="5.88">feeling that it was not gonna go down</text>
  <text start="93.28" dur="8.49">but go down it did she did speak for</text>
  <text start="96.88" dur="7.53">hours and hours and hours I hope it was</text>
  <text start="101.77" dur="4.32">cathartic for her but in case you didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="104.41" dur="3.39">catch the whole thing I made you a</text>
  <text start="106.09" dur="3.66">little summary you had any information</text>
  <text start="107.8" dur="5.97">regarding the president at his state&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="109.75" dur="5.31">accepting any bribes you have any</text>
  <text start="113.77" dur="2.61">information regarding any criminal</text>
  <text start="115.06" dur="2.64">activity that the President of the</text>
  <text start="116.38" dur="6.03">United States has been involved with at</text>
  <text start="117.7" dur="6.33">all so I hope that helps post 3596</text>
  <text start="122.41" dur="3.72">thirty eight minutes out to the hour of</text>
  <text start="124.03" dur="4.259">one and yes that&amp;#39;s the correct time and</text>
  <text start="126.13" dur="5.37">yes it also may be different from your</text>
  <text start="128.289" dur="4.891">time figure it out what advantages might</text>
  <text start="131.5" dur="3.54">exist when you know the other side&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="133.18" dur="3.63">playbook well you know what their</text>
  <text start="135.04" dur="3.24">strengths their weaknesses are you know</text>
  <text start="136.81" dur="2.94">what their tendencies are you know what</text>
  <text start="138.28" dur="3.72">their bag of tricks is you know what</text>
  <text start="139.75" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re going to defend against and it</text>
  <text start="142" dur="3.96">will probably help you see it coming</text>
  <text start="144.13" dur="4.41">down the road so there&amp;#39;s lots of</text>
  <text start="145.96" dur="5.34">advantages there and in regards to this</text>
  <text start="148.54" dur="4.23">whole situation with this perfect phone</text>
  <text start="151.3" dur="3.03">call and yet we have all these</text>
  <text start="152.77" dur="3.27">whistleblowers who claim that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="154.33" dur="3.9">imperfect as a matter of fact they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="156.04" dur="3.93">willing to die on this hill and go for</text>
  <text start="158.23" dur="4.29">impeachment over this whole thing</text>
  <text start="159.97" dur="4.44">seems pretty important right seems like</text>
  <text start="162.52" dur="4.02">a pretty big trap now when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="164.41" dur="3.9">looking for leakers or whistleblowers or</text>
  <text start="166.54" dur="4.38">in this case it&amp;#39;s kind of the same thing</text>
  <text start="168.31" dur="4.74">right one way to do it is to know what</text>
  <text start="170.92" dur="4.38">the actual conversation is and then</text>
  <text start="173.05" dur="5.159">maybe leak out a couple of different</text>
  <text start="175.3" dur="5.37">versions those who are into</text>
  <text start="178.209" dur="4.741">knuckleheaded rimae grab on to those</text>
  <text start="180.67" dur="4.399">said versions and then leak it either to</text>
  <text start="182.95" dur="3.78">the media other intelligence officials</text>
  <text start="185.069" dur="4.451">politicians or whatnot</text>
  <text start="186.73" dur="4.29">maybe even foreign dignitaries but</text>
  <text start="189.52" dur="3.12">that&amp;#39;s how this is going on that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="191.02" dur="3.48">we&amp;#39;ve caught our leakers by basically</text>
  <text start="192.64" dur="3.9">giving them a false version of a story</text>
  <text start="194.5" dur="4.26">and then seeing who bites and then just</text>
  <text start="196.54" dur="3.9">following that whole path who&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="198.76" dur="3.48">end up reporting it and then we can kind</text>
  <text start="200.44" dur="4.11">of figure out the chain right that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="202.24" dur="4.56">what this is all about and I think</text>
  <text start="204.55" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s probably why the POTUS</text>
  <text start="206.8" dur="4.71">constantly refers to this phone call as</text>
  <text start="209.02" dur="5.16">a perfect phone call because it almost</text>
  <text start="211.51" dur="7.2">seems like a perfect trap but either way</text>
  <text start="214.18" dur="6.51">it is definitely a trap that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="218.71" dur="3.69">said and merriam-webster says it too</text>
  <text start="220.69" dur="3.06">this is the definition right here we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="222.4" dur="2.67">gonna go through all this you can read</text>
  <text start="223.75" dur="3.24">it for yourself I think we all</text>
  <text start="225.07" dur="3.9">understand this is a trap everybody</text>
  <text start="226.99" dur="4.5">walked right into this and the more that</text>
  <text start="228.97" dur="4.35">they are willing to go in front of</text>
  <text start="231.49" dur="3.3">whether the senator Congress of testify</text>
  <text start="233.32" dur="3.3">and really start putting themselves out</text>
  <text start="234.79" dur="4.11">on Front Street about this whole</text>
  <text start="236.62" dur="3.9">narrative it exposes themselves and</text>
  <text start="238.9" dur="3.45">that&amp;#39;s essentially what this was all</text>
  <text start="240.52" dur="4.92">about right meanwhile POTUS knows</text>
  <text start="242.35" dur="4.71">exactly that this call was just fun does</text>
  <text start="245.44" dur="4.35">it seem like a really really big deal</text>
  <text start="247.06" dur="5.13">right but this means everything for</text>
  <text start="249.79" dur="4.89">somebody like say a Joe Biden and</text>
  <text start="252.19" dur="4.44">speaking of Joe Biden and the son check</text>
  <text start="254.68" dur="4.529">out what congresswoman at least Stefon a</text>
  <text start="256.63" dur="5.01">cast to say the first time you</text>
  <text start="259.209" dur="4.291">personally became aware of Burr yzma was</text>
  <text start="261.64" dur="3.57">actually when you were being prepared by</text>

  <text start="300.02" dur="4.44">Americans watching President Obama&amp;#39;s own</text>

  <text start="533.899" dur="5.461">WikiLeaks was the when the WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="536.69" dur="5.37">published the vault 7 drops this all had</text>
  <text start="539.36" dur="4.65">to do with how the CIA was infiltrating</text>
  <text start="542.06" dur="3.87">all these different programs and in</text>
  <text start="544.01" dur="4.199">doing so they were leaving kind of this</text>
  <text start="545.93" dur="4.92">stamp or a footprint if you will which</text>
  <text start="548.209" dur="4.44">would implicate that either China or</text>
  <text start="550.85" dur="3.33">Russia had hacked it or whatnot it</text>
  <text start="552.649" dur="3.69">looked like they were trying to pin the</text>

  <text start="556.339" dur="4.351">exactly who it was we suspect it could</text>
  <text start="558.41" dur="4.08">have been Snowden or this Snowden 2.0 or</text>
  <text start="560.69" dur="4.079">whatever but we&amp;#39;re not really sure but</text>
  <text start="562.49" dur="4.889">that was essentially the mission and</text>
  <text start="564.769" dur="5.43">this was being done so through this</text>
  <text start="567.379" dur="4.29">which was a debugging program now if</text>
  <text start="570.199" dur="5.07">you&amp;#39;ll remember Snowden worked for the</text>
  <text start="571.669" dur="7.32">CIA but also worked for the NSA with NSA</text>
  <text start="575.269" dur="5.99">contractor Booz Allen Hamilton and so it</text>
  <text start="578.989" dur="6.481">seems like the mission was to infiltrate</text>
  <text start="581.259" dur="6.13">centralized secure and expose to harm if</text>
  <text start="585.47" dur="5.189">you&amp;#39;ll remember this essentially pitted</text>
  <text start="587.389" dur="6.12">the CIA against the NSA it looked like</text>
  <text start="590.659" dur="4.62">Snowden basically stole and leaked some</text>
  <text start="593.509" dur="3.3">of these surveillance secrets and then</text>
  <text start="595.279" dur="3.63">kind of published it to make it look</text>
  <text start="596.809" dur="4.77">like he was the good guy but essentially</text>
  <text start="598.909" dur="5.88">was kind of giving a dog whistle for</text>
  <text start="601.579" dur="4.53">everybody warning of the NSA and tried</text>
  <text start="604.789" dur="3.9">to skirt the NSA and of course when he</text>
  <text start="606.109" dur="5.43">dropped all this he ran off to Russia</text>
  <text start="608.689" dur="4.26">interestingly enough well it looked like</text>
  <text start="611.539" dur="2.76">the White House had done some</text>
  <text start="612.949" dur="3.03">interference here White House</text>

  <text start="619.009" dur="5.34">the NSA bla bla bla bla nothing really</text>

  <text start="626.989" dur="4.35">fiddler ended up turning into ghost wine</text>
  <text start="629.839" dur="2.761">and when we talk about Prime I think</text>
  <text start="631.339" dur="3.59">we&amp;#39;re talking about the program for</text>
  <text start="632.6" dur="4.769">research infrastructure and matching</text>
  <text start="634.929" dur="5.56">expenses this was supposed to be kind of</text>
  <text start="637.369" dur="5.28">a Protection Bureau and they would find</text>
  <text start="640.489" dur="4.08">other institutions financial</text>
  <text start="642.649" dur="3.6">institutions and whatnot but what they</text>
  <text start="644.569" dur="3.45">were essentially doing was using it as a</text>
  <text start="646.249" dur="3.75">slush fund take penalizing other</text>
  <text start="648.019" dur="3.54">institutions and then just funneling all</text>
  <text start="649.999" dur="3.06">that money into whatever they wanted</text>
  <text start="651.559" dur="5.041">whether it was somebody&amp;#39;s Democratic</text>
  <text start="653.059" dur="5.55">Party campaign or maybe an Tifa or Isis</text>
  <text start="656.6" dur="5.339">or whatever was the flavor of the day</text>
  <text start="658.609" dur="5.19">they could fund it by way of this prime</text>
  <text start="661.939" dur="3.9">and they were doing it by way of the</text>
  <text start="663.799" dur="3.48">colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences</text>
  <text start="665.839" dur="3.33">which is what I think we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="667.279" dur="4.47">about in mission seven as opposed to</text>
  <text start="669.169" dur="5.73">just simply classified this was a way</text>
  <text start="671.749" dur="5.93">that they could kind of you know use the</text>
  <text start="674.899" dur="6.571">mainstream media journalists teachers</text>
  <text start="677.679" dur="5.74">professors whatnot bloggers anybody who</text>
  <text start="681.47" dur="3.509">could control the narrative and they</text>
  <text start="683.419" dur="5.07">were doing this originally to elect</text>
  <text start="684.979" dur="5.4">President Obama at the time but one of</text>
  <text start="688.489" dur="5.97">these programs actually it was called</text>
  <text start="690.379" dur="6.721">project Narwhal oddly enough he&amp;#39;s he is</text>
  <text start="694.459" dur="3.99">wink wink but that&amp;#39;s probably what we</text>
  <text start="697.1" dur="3.779">were talking about here and then it</text>
  <text start="698.449" dur="4.68">brings us to Mission a whistleblower</text>
  <text start="700.879" dur="4.14">traps and of course I think what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="703.129" dur="4.35">talking about here is exactly what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="705.019" dur="3.87">starting to see now right if you</text>
  <text start="707.479" dur="4.41">remember we were talking about the</text>
  <text start="708.889" dur="4.92">Dropbox program Apache and whatnot and</text>
  <text start="711.889" dur="4.14">of course John Perry Barlow was another</text>
  <text start="713.809" dur="4.59">one of these whistleblowers who had a</text>
  <text start="716.029" dur="4.74">rough go of things now I&amp;#39;m not sure what</text>
  <text start="718.399" dur="4.35">the job see - three five six seven K</text>
  <text start="720.769" dur="3.96">that maybe a future proves passing I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="722.749" dur="3.78">not exactly sure but what I do think</text>
  <text start="724.729" dur="3.63">what we&amp;#39;re talking about was setting up</text>
  <text start="726.529" dur="4.59">a series of these whistleblower drop</text>
  <text start="728.359" dur="4.29">boxes and that was a way to trap some of</text>
  <text start="731.119" dur="4.38">these people we already kind of got an</text>
  <text start="732.649" dur="4.41">idea of that with Edward Snowden that</text>
  <text start="735.499" dur="3.21">would lead us up to mission 9 which is</text>
  <text start="737.059" dur="3.18">probably where we&amp;#39;re at right here which</text>
  <text start="738.709" dur="3.87">is censorship which is probably gonna</text>
  <text start="740.239" dur="4.92">involve yours truly and I think you all</text>
  <text start="742.579" dur="4.05">know what&amp;#39;s gonna happen from there and</text>
  <text start="745.159" dur="4.441">then of course we had the class plus</text>
  <text start="746.629" dur="4.591">relay which I imagine like I said comes</text>
  <text start="749.6" dur="3.719">from the colleges of Liberal Arts and</text>
  <text start="751.22" dur="4.619">scientists and then gets relayed to</text>
  <text start="753.319" dur="4.74">whatever you know possible platform can</text>
  <text start="755.839" dur="4.5">spread that narrative now as we go back</text>
  <text start="758.059" dur="4.71">to the post 3598 I want to clarify that</text>
  <text start="760.339" dur="4.53">I am NOT lumping in Obama&amp;#39;s project</text>
  <text start="762.769" dur="3.6">Narwhal with this I was just kind of</text>
  <text start="764.869" dur="2.88">recalling that off the top of my head</text>
  <text start="766.369" dur="4.14">because we were just talking about this</text>
  <text start="767.749" dur="4.68">dog named Narwhal but to clarify what</text>
  <text start="770.509" dur="4.53">that was is that this was a program it</text>
  <text start="772.429" dur="4.41">was a data collection program and if you</text>
  <text start="775.039" dur="3.39">had signed up for his website back in</text>
  <text start="776.839" dur="3.84">the day this would have been around 2012</text>
  <text start="778.429" dur="4.65">they were using this information to spam</text>
  <text start="780.679" dur="4.08">you with all kinds of tailored emails to</text>
  <text start="783.079" dur="4.92">fit your demographic or whatever but</text>
  <text start="784.759" dur="5.1">basically to sway you towards leaning</text>
  <text start="787.999" dur="4.29">towards the Obama narrative or not but</text>
  <text start="789.859" dur="4.38">this was called project Narwhal you can</text>
  <text start="792.289" dur="2.94">go ahead and look that up but I wanted</text>
  <text start="794.239" dur="2.94">to bring that up because it just</text>
  <text start="795.229" dur="4.32">reminded me considering we were talking</text>
  <text start="797.179" dur="3.93">about this dog named Narwhal just</text>
  <text start="799.549" dur="3.36">yesterday now we&amp;#39;re talking about all</text>
  <text start="801.109" dur="3.08">this stuff but I do think we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="802.909" dur="3.54">about these</text>
  <text start="804.189" dur="3.9">Dropbox type programs whether it was a</text>
  <text start="806.449" dur="3.57">patchy or something like that and</text>
  <text start="808.089" dur="4.27">essentially it looks like a lot of these</text>
  <text start="810.019" dur="4.26">people have walked right into this trap</text>
  <text start="812.359" dur="3.93">like we talked about POTUS giving out</text>
  <text start="814.279" dur="5.13">all these different narratives to see</text>
  <text start="816.289" dur="4.89">which ones are are leaky pants now in</text>
  <text start="819.409" dur="4.5">regards to this here in the post whole</text>
  <text start="821.179" dur="4.171">or parts break slash break I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="823.909" dur="3.39">really sure but the first thing I</text>
  <text start="825.35" dur="5.25">thought of is using the term brake-force</text>
  <text start="827.299" dur="4.181">a ham radio communications and let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="830.6" dur="2.289">that we</text>
  <text start="831.48" dur="3.24">to people that are talking about the</text>
  <text start="832.889" dur="4.231">weather patterns or whatever something</text>
  <text start="834.72" dur="3.809">very very common and I need to break in</text>
  <text start="837.12" dur="3.18">with something more important like an</text>
  <text start="838.529" dur="4.201">accident or you know whatever an</text>
  <text start="840.3" dur="5.279">emergency situation I might use that</text>
  <text start="842.73" dur="3.99">term to break to break in and you know</text>
  <text start="845.579" dur="2.671">signify that there&amp;#39;s something more</text>
  <text start="846.72" dur="3.51">important as you can see right there I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="848.25" dur="4.079">flashing you a little graphic kind of</text>
  <text start="850.23" dur="4.26">backing that up now from what I</text>
  <text start="852.329" dur="4.231">understand this can also be used in air</text>
  <text start="854.49" dur="3.57">traffic control during busy times if</text>
  <text start="856.56" dur="3.899">you&amp;#39;re talking to multiple planes you</text>
  <text start="858.06" dur="4.26">might use the term break break to</text>
  <text start="860.459" dur="3.721">signify that the very next thing that</text>
  <text start="862.32" dur="3.959">you say is referring to somebody</text>
  <text start="864.18" dur="3.63">different so maybe you&amp;#39;re talking to one</text>
  <text start="866.279" dur="3.511">plane and then you say break break and</text>
  <text start="867.81" dur="3.42">that lets the person know that the next</text>
  <text start="869.79" dur="3.33">things coming out of your mouth you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="871.23" dur="3.75">talking to the next plane it lets people</text>
  <text start="873.12" dur="3.24">know that you&amp;#39;re moving on you guys can</text>
  <text start="874.98" dur="3.15">let me know what you think about that</text>
  <text start="876.36" dur="3">but that was what I thought about and of</text>
  <text start="878.13" dur="3.389">course thinking about that terminology</text>
  <text start="879.36" dur="4.919">it made me wonder if this was maybe</text>
  <text start="881.519" dur="5.041">talking about kind of a way of saying</text>
  <text start="884.279" dur="3.691">that we understand what was being you</text>
  <text start="886.56" dur="4.2">know done through these ham radio</text>
  <text start="887.97" dur="5.669">communications and as you know Nelly or</text>
  <text start="890.76" dur="4.47">had herself a ham radio license and she</text>
  <text start="893.639" dur="4.651">was likely using this to communicate</text>
  <text start="895.23" dur="4.65">with Russians to go back and forth as</text>
  <text start="898.29" dur="4.68">she was compiling all her information</text>
  <text start="899.88" dur="5.49">for this steel dossier but that would be</text>
  <text start="902.97" dur="3.72">my guess either way Q says you have more</text>
  <text start="905.37" dur="3.69">than you know so I have a feeling we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="906.69" dur="4.889">probably end up seeing it and finding</text>
  <text start="909.06" dur="5.639">out exactly what that code means Q says</text>
  <text start="911.579" dur="5.37">future proves past Q all right Patriots</text>
  <text start="914.699" dur="3.931">those are your cue posts for now and</text>
  <text start="916.949" dur="3.661">finally let me leave you with this this</text>
  <text start="918.63" dur="4.11">is a caller calling in to c-span</text>
  <text start="920.61" dur="4.32">regarding the impeachment stream and</text>
