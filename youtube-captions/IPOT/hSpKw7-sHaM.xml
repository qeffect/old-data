  <text start="173.019" dur="5.55">OIG has released their report all 476</text>
  <text start="176.83" dur="4.29">pages of it in regards to the four</text>
  <text start="178.569" dur="5.971">fighter applications and the crossfire</text>
  <text start="181.12" dur="5.19">hurricane investigation so we have a lot</text>
  <text start="184.54" dur="3.479">of interesting details here and I think</text>
  <text start="186.31" dur="4.05">over the next really probably the next</text>
  <text start="188.019" dur="4.591">month or so there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot of</text>
  <text start="190.36" dur="3.48">channels poring over the details on this</text>
  <text start="192.61" dur="3.39">and we&amp;#39;re gonna talk a little bit about</text>
  <text start="193.84" dur="3.63">it today although it is not specifically</text>
  <text start="196" dur="3.36">what I really want to talk about there</text>
  <text start="197.47" dur="3.659">are some interesting things that I do</text>
  <text start="199.36" dur="4.32">want to bring up but first I want to</text>
  <text start="201.129" dur="4.11">talk about some of these cue proofs now</text>
  <text start="203.68" dur="3.21">if you&amp;#39;re following Q and on I want to</text>
  <text start="205.239" dur="5.041">take you to the upper left corner here</text>
  <text start="206.89" dur="6.42">post 36 42 and this was not from long</text>
  <text start="210.28" dur="5.73">ago 2nd of December and this is a</text>
  <text start="213.31" dur="5.13">picture of a watch the executive order</text>
  <text start="216.01" dur="4.02">pan and the notebook there we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="218.44" dur="3.87">this photo before if you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="220.03" dur="3.9">following queueing on and as you can see</text>
  <text start="222.31" dur="3.299">clearly there it looks like the time is</text>
  <text start="223.93" dur="6.419">showing right around 1:30 looks like</text>
  <text start="225.609" dur="6.6">just before maybe 1:29 now the OIG was</text>
  <text start="230.349" dur="3.57">supposed to be released at 1 o&amp;#39;clock and</text>
  <text start="232.209" dur="4.771">actually it was released at 1 o&amp;#39;clock</text>
  <text start="233.919" dur="5.97">but interestingly enough it got posted</text>
  <text start="236.98" dur="4.409">at 1:29 we saw this from the Justice oyg</text>
  <text start="239.889" dur="4.68">Twitter which you see in the upper right</text>
  <text start="241.389" dur="5.85">corner there DOJ oij o IG releases</text>
  <text start="244.569" dur="5.04">review of 4 or 5 citations da da da and</text>
  <text start="247.239" dur="6.451">then you see on their website too they</text>
  <text start="249.609" dur="6.361">also release this on 1:29 not to mention</text>
  <text start="253.69" dur="3.57">the Durham response which is actually</text>
  <text start="255.97" dur="3.509">what I think is a little bit more</text>
  <text start="257.26" dur="5.61">interesting in my opinion was also</text>
  <text start="259.479" dur="6.541">released at 129 now if you look at the</text>
  <text start="262.87" dur="6.84">bottom right corner we see this post 36</text>
  <text start="266.02" dur="5.67">43 and we saw this the other day 2q was</text>
  <text start="269.71" dur="3.48">taking us back to yet another post I</text>
  <text start="271.69" dur="3">know it&amp;#39;s probably a little small but</text>
  <text start="273.19" dur="5.31">where it&amp;#39;s highlighted in red their post</text>
  <text start="274.69" dur="5.76">3:09 where we see justice well indeed</text>
  <text start="278.5" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;ve seen that term justice before it</text>
  <text start="280.45" dur="4.23">seemed to be another place marker and</text>
  <text start="282.07" dur="7.32">cute was letting us know now that was</text>
  <text start="284.68" dur="7.83">labeled on the night of December 2017</text>
  <text start="289.39" dur="5.52">No so it was a couple of years ago to</text>
  <text start="292.51" dur="4.05">the day and of course if you see the</text>
  <text start="294.91" dur="5.37">timestamp there I know it&amp;#39;s a little bit</text>
  <text start="296.56" dur="7.26">faint there but it was posted at 1:28 so</text>
  <text start="300.28" dur="6.09">very nearly 1:29 I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s all just</text>
  <text start="303.82" dur="4.44">strictly coincidental and here we see</text>
  <text start="306.37" dur="5.04">another graphic showing that the Durham</text>
  <text start="308.26" dur="4.5">release was indeed at 129 so you have a</text>
  <text start="311.41" dur="4.26">few different sources they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="312.76" dur="5.76">released at 129 all connected to the DOJ</text>
  <text start="315.67" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s the DOJ is a way of letting you</text>
  <text start="318.52" dur="5.43">know that everything is a-okay hence the</text>
  <text start="321.4" dur="4.74">Hugh proofs right I get a lot of</text>
  <text start="323.95" dur="4.47">questions asking why does QED keep</text>
  <text start="326.14" dur="4.08">posting all these QED proofs we get it</text>
  <text start="328.42" dur="3.18">we get it well the point is to let you</text>
  <text start="330.22" dur="4.26">know that the game is still on if you</text>
  <text start="331.6" dur="5.22">stop seeing QED proofs you might be able</text>
  <text start="334.48" dur="3.9">to assume that something is not okay so</text>
  <text start="336.82" dur="4.89">this is a way of letting everybody know</text>
  <text start="338.38" dur="5.31">that game is still on and we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="341.71" dur="3.93">this a lot I&amp;#39;m sure I wasn&amp;#39;t the only</text>
  <text start="343.69" dur="3.66">one who picked up on this I can hardly</text>
  <text start="345.64" dur="3.18">imagine that I was there was a lot of</text>
  <text start="347.35" dur="3.93">people that made great graphics like</text>
  <text start="348.82" dur="3.99">this picking up on the 129 when we see</text>
  <text start="351.28" dur="3.21">the watch we know a corresponding date</text>
  <text start="352.81" dur="3.72">or time is gonna come real soon</text>
  <text start="354.49" dur="3.18">so it wasn&amp;#39;t too hard to figure out we</text>
  <text start="356.53" dur="3.03">knew that the report was gonna be</text>
  <text start="357.67" dur="3.96">released at one o&amp;#39;clock so it should be</text>
  <text start="359.56" dur="5.79">no surprise that it all kind of got</text>
  <text start="361.63" dur="6.06">released online at 129 so there you go</text>
  <text start="365.35" dur="5.19">and like I said we&amp;#39;re not gonna cover a</text>
  <text start="367.69" dur="4.68">ton of the OIG report today but I do</text>
  <text start="370.54" dur="3.9">want to mention that what I thought was</text>
  <text start="372.37" dur="3.48">the real important takeaway was the</text>
  <text start="374.44" dur="3.81">statement from John Durham and he was</text>
  <text start="375.85" dur="3.99">part of it I had the utmost respect for</text>
  <text start="378.25" dur="3.78">the mission of the Office of Inspector</text>
  <text start="379.84" dur="3.99">General and the comprehensive work that</text>
  <text start="382.03" dur="3.42">went into the report prepared by mr.</text>
  <text start="383.83" dur="4.26">Horowitz and his staff Durham said</text>
  <text start="385.45" dur="4.44">however our investigation is not limited</text>
  <text start="388.09" dur="4.14">to developing information from within</text>
  <text start="389.89" dur="4.17">components parts of the Justice</text>
  <text start="392.23" dur="3.63">Department our investigation has</text>
  <text start="394.06" dur="4.05">included developing information from</text>
  <text start="395.86" dur="4.44">other persons and entities both in the</text>
  <text start="398.11" dur="4.74">US and outside of the US okay well we</text>
  <text start="400.3" dur="4.29">knew this already - right and we knew</text>
  <text start="402.85" dur="3.51">that this was going to be the real meat</text>
  <text start="404.59" dur="3.9">of the matter what we really want to do</text>
  <text start="406.36" dur="4.32">is we want to hear from Horowitz and we</text>
  <text start="408.49" dur="3.99">want to hear from Durham we want to see</text>
  <text start="410.68" dur="4.95">what Durham picked up on because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="412.48" dur="5.31">got a much wider scope right now the</text>
  <text start="415.63" dur="3.99">importance of the OIG report is pretty</text>
  <text start="417.79" dur="4.349">clear - because we have to really show</text>
  <text start="419.62" dur="5.19">the political aspect of all of this</text>
  <text start="422.139" dur="4.02">old ugly right we have to lay it out now</text>
  <text start="424.81" dur="3.81">most of us you&amp;#39;re probably very familiar</text>
  <text start="426.159" dur="4.62">with right we already know that the DOJ</text>
  <text start="428.62" dur="4.47">weapon is to this holstee a steel</text>
  <text start="430.779" dur="3.63">dossier and they supplanted fake</text>
  <text start="433.09" dur="3.479">information so that they could have a</text>
  <text start="434.409" dur="3.84">reason to even open up these files and</text>
  <text start="436.569" dur="3.241">warrants in the first place we know but</text>
  <text start="438.249" dur="3.901">the whole FISA Court thing is a little</text>
  <text start="439.81" dur="3.99">bit sketchy to begin with we know who</text>
  <text start="442.15" dur="4.319">signed off on these warrants we know who</text>
  <text start="443.8" dur="5.519">renewed these warrants we know who was</text>
  <text start="446.469" dur="4.53">tail so we already know all this but</text>
  <text start="449.319" dur="4.081">there&amp;#39;s still a lot of this not being</text>
  <text start="450.999" dur="4.89">reported in the mainstream media which</text>
  <text start="453.4" dur="6.21">sadly is where we still have to get this</text>
  <text start="455.889" dur="5.64">out so the OIG report is going to be</text>
  <text start="459.61" dur="4.14">probably a source for talking points for</text>
  <text start="461.529" dur="4.051">the next couple of months but I really</text>
  <text start="463.75" dur="4.529">am looking forward to seeing what Durham</text>
  <text start="465.58" dur="4.38">has to say on a much bigger level now I</text>
  <text start="468.279" dur="4.2">believe President Trump feels the same</text>
  <text start="469.96" dur="5.759">way I do he&amp;#39;s not as interested in this</text>
  <text start="472.479" dur="6.09">IG report as he is with this derm report</text>
  <text start="475.719" dur="5.431">where the real meat of the matter exists</text>
  <text start="478.569" dur="5.4">and he expressed it very clearly at his</text>
  <text start="481.15" dur="5.609">rally in Hershey Pennsylvania so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="483.969" dur="17.551">gonna let him do the explain it with a</text>
  <text start="486.759" dur="19.08">montage then the Inspector General that</text>
  <text start="501.52" dur="7.709">the Obama FBI obtained secret warrants</text>
  <text start="505.839" dur="7.591">to spy on my campaign based on a phony</text>
  <text start="509.229" dur="6.87">foreign dossier of the Bob Spears paid</text>
  <text start="513.43" dur="5">for by crooked Hillary Clinton and the</text>
  <text start="516.099" dur="2.331">DEA&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="520.3" dur="5.7">the FBI failed to disclose the nature of</text>
  <text start="523.73" dur="5.61">the politically job to the FISA Court</text>
  <text start="526" dur="6.31">they hit it they deceived it and they</text>
  <text start="529.34" dur="6.86">lied the dossier was written by a</text>
  <text start="532.31" dur="6.54">discredited foreign agent who quote</text>
  <text start="536.2" dur="5.92">desperately Donald Trump not get elected</text>
  <text start="538.85" dur="5.52">and was passionate about him not being</text>
  <text start="542.12" dur="5.25">the United States President and what</text>
  <text start="544.37" dur="5.22">says these folks they spied in our</text>
  <text start="547.37" dur="6.2">campaign okay so that pretty much sums</text>
  <text start="549.59" dur="13.38">up the last three years like all of it</text>
  <text start="553.57" dur="10.9">right there look Lloyd I don&amp;#39;t know I</text>
  <text start="562.97" dur="4.98">don&amp;#39;t know I just keep away</text>
  <text start="564.47" dur="8.67">I live forward to bull Durham&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="567.95" dur="10.04">report that&amp;#39;s the one I look for and</text>
  <text start="573.14" dur="7.11">this report was great by the IG</text>
  <text start="577.99" dur="7.08">especially since she was appointed by</text>
  <text start="580.25" dur="4.82">President Barack Hussein Obama</text>
  <text start="586.83" dur="6.46">considering that fact it was great</text>
  <text start="590.86" dur="4.05">because we learned a lot of things that</text>
  <text start="593.29" dur="4.14">nobody would have found out very easily</text>
  <text start="594.91" dur="3.81">although I suspect we would have alright</text>
  <text start="597.43" dur="2.16">so this is interesting but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="598.72" dur="2.73">imagine we&amp;#39;re gonna get any real</text>
  <text start="599.59" dur="3.24">bombshell it&amp;#39;s out of Horowitz we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="601.45" dur="3.6">gonna see some interesting things in</text>
  <text start="602.83" dur="4.68">this report and I do imagine that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="605.05" dur="4.5">cooperating and all that but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="607.51" dur="4.26">necessarily think he&amp;#39;s gonna go out of</text>
  <text start="609.55" dur="3.96">his way to throw his buddies under the</text>
  <text start="611.77" dur="3.81">bus right we&amp;#39;re not gonna see all these</text>
  <text start="613.51" dur="4.05">criminal referrals like had been talked</text>
  <text start="615.58" dur="4.17">about on the mainstream media that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="617.56" dur="3.72">necessarily the case and let&amp;#39;s keep in</text>
  <text start="619.75" dur="3.48">mind that when this all got dropped</text>
  <text start="621.28" dur="4.2">Durham&amp;#39;s statement was already there</text>
  <text start="623.23" dur="5.22">right at the same time which shows that</text>
  <text start="625.48" dur="4.74">Durham was already not on the same page</text>
  <text start="628.45" dur="3.87">and wanted to make it very clear to the</text>
  <text start="630.22" dur="4.11">public I think that&amp;#39;s very important and</text>
  <text start="632.32" dur="4.08">I think that Trump does too he</text>
  <text start="634.33" dur="4.95">recognizes that we&amp;#39;re not gonna see any</text>
  <text start="636.4" dur="5.49">big whoopty dues out of the IG report</text>
  <text start="639.28" dur="5.31">but it is important to show that this</text>
  <text start="641.89" dur="4.8">person was able to lay out the political</text>
  <text start="644.59" dur="4.05">aspect of all this now we get to see the</text>
  <text start="646.69" dur="3.48">criminal aspect but you have to be able</text>
  <text start="648.64" dur="4.05">to bridge the gap you have to be able to</text>
  <text start="650.17" dur="4.38">kind of place these stepping stones in</text>
  <text start="652.69" dur="4.32">place if you will if you ever want to</text>
  <text start="654.55" dur="4.35">red pill any newer people and these are</text>
  <text start="657.01" dur="3.93">people that wouldn&amp;#39;t have supported</text>
  <text start="658.9" dur="3.75">Trump in the first place so being able</text>
  <text start="660.94" dur="3.66">to lay this out is important but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="662.65" dur="5.09">most certainly not going to be any big</text>
  <text start="664.6" dur="3.14">boom boom boom</text>
  <text start="673.63" dur="7.36">least I love you so much Lisa please</text>
  <text start="676.55" dur="7.01">listen Lisa never loved anyone like you</text>
  <text start="680.99" dur="5.52">we won&amp;#39;t allow this to happen to our</text>

  <text start="699.38" dur="7.8">says stone cold corrupt person if for</text>
  <text start="702.98" dur="5.94">any reason she loses Peter we&amp;#39;ve got to</text>
  <text start="707.18" dur="7.2">have an insurance policy we have to do</text>
  <text start="708.92" dur="7.32">it because what&amp;#39;s all right so this is</text>
  <text start="714.38" dur="4.17">interesting on a few different levels</text>
  <text start="716.24" dur="4.14">first of all it&amp;#39;s great comedy for the</text>
  <text start="718.55" dur="3.84">POTUS he&amp;#39;s killing it out at the rally</text>
  <text start="720.38" dur="4.47">he&amp;#39;s making a great joke this is kind of</text>
  <text start="722.39" dur="5.1">what he does best love it or hate it</text>
  <text start="724.85" dur="5.01">this is what he does very well now he</text>
  <text start="727.49" dur="5.61">actually goes on to talk about the fact</text>
  <text start="729.86" dur="5.19">that he heard that Peter struck received</text>
  <text start="733.1" dur="4.23">a restraining order and of course that</text>
  <text start="735.05" dur="5.61">would add a new layer to this story</text>
  <text start="737.33" dur="5.61">which kind of adds on to a theory that</text>
  <text start="740.66" dur="5.76">I&amp;#39;m not so sure Peter struck and Lisa</text>
  <text start="742.94" dur="5.04">Paige really are lovers however I do</text>
  <text start="746.42" dur="4.29">think there&amp;#39;s a reason why this</text>
  <text start="747.98" dur="5.46">narrative is being presented now</text>
  <text start="750.71" dur="4.95">consider Lisa Paige and B&amp;#39;Etor struck</text>
  <text start="753.44" dur="5.49">Peter struck is married so that leaves</text>
  <text start="755.66" dur="4.95">us another character a jilted lover and</text>
  <text start="758.93" dur="4.11">we already saw this we saw this a few</text>
  <text start="760.61" dur="3.93">weeks ago where Peter strux wife had</text>
  <text start="763.04" dur="3.45">presented that you know she was the one</text>
  <text start="764.54" dur="2.91">who found the texts oh no my god I</text>
  <text start="766.49" dur="3.75">couldn&amp;#39;t believe it</text>
  <text start="767.45" dur="6.18">she&amp;#39;s happy our single heartbroken right</text>
  <text start="770.24" dur="5.69">you have the Chilton lover let&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="773.63" dur="6.48">consider that Peter Starks wife is</text>
  <text start="775.93" dur="8.2">Melissa Hodgman and Melissa Hodgman in</text>
  <text start="780.11" dur="6.18">October of 2016 was promoted to</text>
  <text start="784.13" dur="4.2">associate director of the Securities and</text>
  <text start="786.29" dur="4.89">Exchange Commission pretty powerful</text>
  <text start="788.33" dur="4.62">position and that&amp;#39;s curious enough but</text>
  <text start="791.18" dur="7.71">what&amp;#39;s more curious is that she was</text>
  <text start="792.95" dur="8.16">promoted hours not days hours after the</text>
  <text start="798.89" dur="4.71">FBI found classified information on</text>
  <text start="801.11" dur="4.29">Hillary&amp;#39;s laptop who was in charge of</text>
  <text start="803.6" dur="4.97">that investigation or</text>
  <text start="805.4" dur="3.17">husband Peter struck</text>
  <text start="810.63" dur="4.139">so ladies and gentlemen I would humbly</text>
  <text start="812.639" dur="3.961">suggest that the reason POTUS keeps</text>
  <text start="814.769" dur="3.56">bringing this up is because he wants to</text>
  <text start="816.6" dur="4.08">turn our attention to the relationship</text>
  <text start="818.329" dur="4.75">itself not so much because he wants to</text>
  <text start="820.68" dur="3.81">clown them about being lovers but</text>
  <text start="823.079" dur="4.081">because he wants to point out that</text>
  <text start="824.49" dur="6.029">there&amp;#39;s a third party involved the one</text>
  <text start="827.16" dur="6.33">that found the text messages allegedly</text>
  <text start="830.519" dur="7.591">right and these text messages said what</text>
  <text start="833.49" dur="7.17">don&amp;#39;t worry we&amp;#39;ll stop him well what</text>
  <text start="838.11" dur="4.89">better way to stop him right than to</text>
  <text start="840.66" dur="4.26">just simply have Obama appoint your wife</text>
  <text start="843" dur="3.779">to the head of the Securities and</text>
  <text start="844.92" dur="3.39">Exchange Commission where they could</text>
  <text start="846.779" dur="3.781">review all the fraud and financial</text>
  <text start="848.31" dur="4.62">dealings that might have gone on in that</text>
  <text start="850.56" dur="6.48">laptop only to decide that it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="852.93" dur="7.74">such a big deal seems like a big deal to</text>
  <text start="857.04" dur="5.94">me seems like a heck of a insurance</text>
  <text start="860.67" dur="5.099">policy ladies and gentlemen I would</text>
  <text start="862.98" dur="5.549">argue that Melissa Hodgman is the</text>
  <text start="865.769" dur="6.901">insurance policy now two weeks later</text>
  <text start="868.529" dur="7.05">James nobodies homie corny decides to</text>
  <text start="872.67" dur="5.25">reopen the investigation and then of</text>
  <text start="875.579" dur="4.141">course we have the infamous meeting with</text>
  <text start="877.92" dur="6.029">Bill Clinton and aunt Loretta Lynch on</text>
  <text start="879.72" dur="7.01">the tarmac in which Bill Clinton waited</text>
  <text start="883.949" dur="5.611">four hours to meet aunt Loretta Lynch</text>
  <text start="886.73" dur="5.469">only to decide that they&amp;#39;re just gonna</text>
  <text start="889.56" dur="4.199">talk about grandkids for a while well</text>
  <text start="892.199" dur="3.841">somebody must have had audio that</text>
  <text start="893.759" dur="5.041">conversation right what we do know is</text>
  <text start="896.04" dur="6.09">after that conversation this email</text>
  <text start="898.8" dur="4.62">situation just became a matter case</text>
  <text start="902.13" dur="3.29">closed</text>
  <text start="903.42" dur="5.099">so ladies and gentlemen I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="905.42" dur="4.33">but I&amp;#39;m just saying don&amp;#39;t believe the</text>
  <text start="908.519" dur="3.18">hype when it comes to this whole lubber</text>
  <text start="909.75" dur="4.319">situation I think there&amp;#39;s a lot more to</text>
  <text start="911.699" dur="3.87">this story keep in mind there are a ton</text>
  <text start="914.069" dur="4.161">of exchanges going back and forth</text>
  <text start="915.569" dur="5.851">between Peter Strahm and Lisa Paige</text>
  <text start="918.23" dur="4.479">neither of these two were low-level Lisa</text>
  <text start="921.42" dur="2.909">Paige would love to have you thinking</text>
  <text start="922.709" dur="3.87">that she worked in the mailroom but she</text>
  <text start="924.329" dur="4.171">pulled rank she had a lot of rank and so</text>
  <text start="926.579" dur="4.281">did Peter Straub even more so he was in</text>
  <text start="928.5" dur="4.889">charge of the Clinton email</text>
  <text start="930.86" dur="4.839">investigation and he was he&amp;#39;s known</text>
  <text start="933.389" dur="4.62">about this ever since 2015 when the IC</text>
  <text start="935.699" dur="4.711">IG warned that some of these emails were</text>
  <text start="938.009" dur="4.221">being shared with Chinese officials so</text>
  <text start="940.41" dur="5.6">he had a lot of rang</text>
  <text start="942.23" dur="5.52">so did Lisa Paige and I suppose if you</text>
  <text start="946.01" dur="4.5">present this theory that they&amp;#39;re lovers</text>
  <text start="947.75" dur="5.13">that&amp;#39;s going to help explain the reason</text>
  <text start="950.51" dur="4.77">why they were going back and forth so</text>
  <text start="952.88" dur="4.92">many times but if they&amp;#39;re not lovers</text>
  <text start="955.28" dur="4.85">those communications seem a little bit</text>
  <text start="957.8" dur="5.66">more curious they seem a little bit more</text>
  <text start="960.13" dur="5.17">devious a little bit more professional</text>
  <text start="963.46" dur="4.93">suggesting that this wasn&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="965.3" dur="6.27">political bias this was an active</text>
  <text start="968.39" dur="7.08">operation and of course at the same time</text>
  <text start="971.57" dur="7.68">this whole lover narrative tends to</text>
  <text start="975.47" dur="6.9">soften what may be the perception of the</text>
  <text start="979.25" dur="5.28">most devious person involved in Melissa</text>
  <text start="982.37" dur="5.22">Hodgman who gets promoted to the head of</text>
  <text start="984.53" dur="6.53">the SEC who would end up reviewing a lot</text>
  <text start="987.59" dur="6.15">of that information on that laptop and</text>
  <text start="991.06" dur="4.81">of course paint her in the light as the</text>
  <text start="993.74" dur="4.05">jilted lover so that&amp;#39;s my two cents on</text>
  <text start="995.87" dur="5.79">now keep in mind POTUS brought up very</text>
  <text start="997.79" dur="5.76">expressly this rumor of this restraining</text>
  <text start="1001.66" dur="3.75">order against Peter struck that adds a</text>
  <text start="1003.55" dur="3.54">whole new wrinkle to this thing right if</text>
  <text start="1005.41" dur="4.32">they were indeed lovers what do you</text>
  <text start="1007.09" dur="4.41">really want to hurt Lisa Paige why is he</text>
  <text start="1009.73" dur="4.05">getting a restraining order why she&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="1011.5" dur="4.32">afraid of Peter struck I thought he</text>
  <text start="1013.78" dur="4.44">really cared about her was gonna help</text>
  <text start="1015.82" dur="4.95">stop this whole thing unless of course</text>
  <text start="1018.22" dur="4.86">he&amp;#39;s not really her lover and he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1020.77" dur="3.72">more of a angry agent that&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="1023.08" dur="3.09">bit frustrated because you were a little</text>
  <text start="1024.49" dur="5.099">bit more forthright in your testimony</text>
  <text start="1026.17" dur="4.77">than he was anyway we&amp;#39;re moving on to</text>
  <text start="1029.589" dur="1.891">this story this was a threat I did</text>

  <text start="2143.089" dur="3.711">back in the day as a matter of fact you</text>

  <text start="2167.03" dur="4.2">right well this ended up going real</text>
  <text start="2169.31" dur="4.65">south because the Tyson chicken plant</text>
  <text start="2171.23" dur="5.28">was also contaminating the water out</text>
  <text start="2173.96" dur="4.53">there in Arkansas and this became a real</text>
