  <text start="64.519" dur="3.751">week is what I&amp;#39;m saying meanwhile</text>
  <text start="66.259" dur="9.961">Democrats are getting kind of lippy on</text>
  <text start="68.27" dur="13.17">Twitter seems a little bit excessive to</text>
  <text start="76.22" dur="7.02">me I know right they&amp;#39;re all like whoof</text>
  <text start="81.44" dur="3.33">they do that all the time on Twitter</text>
  <text start="83.24" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s fun to rile them up though how many</text>
  <text start="84.77" dur="5.879">we got yes 34 58 35 minutes after the</text>
  <text start="88.49" dur="5.7">hour of 3q starts us off with a Twitter</text>
  <text start="90.649" dur="5.401">link to James nobody&amp;#39;s home he coming</text>
  <text start="94.19" dur="3.27">he&amp;#39;s talking about an American patriot I</text>
  <text start="96.05" dur="3.75">wonder who it is</text>
  <text start="97.46" dur="4.14">this week an American patriot takes</text>
  <text start="99.8" dur="4.26">center stage mmm</text>
  <text start="101.6" dur="5.43">he doesn&amp;#39;t want attention has principles</text>
  <text start="104.06" dur="4.77">and follows them so it&amp;#39;s not you and</text>
  <text start="107.03" dur="3.269">always tells the truth what an</text>
  <text start="108.83" dur="3.899">opportunity for young people to be</text>
  <text start="110.299" dur="4.5">inspired what a great opportunity for</text>
  <text start="112.729" dur="4.261">both parties in Congress to follow his</text>
  <text start="114.799" dur="3.871">example uh-huh oh we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="116.99" dur="3.87">Robert Miller that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="118.67" dur="3.959">okay well this sounds a little bit like</text>
  <text start="120.86" dur="3.78">a veiled threat to me what an</text>
  <text start="122.629" dur="2.931">opportunity for young people to be</text>
  <text start="124.64" dur="3.929">inspired</text>
  <text start="125.56" dur="4.839">also known as hey and Tifa hit the</text>
  <text start="128.569" dur="5.011">streets what a great opportunity for</text>
  <text start="130.399" dur="5.401">both parties in Congress to follow his</text>
  <text start="133.58" dur="5.4">example sounds like you&amp;#39;re encouraging</text>
  <text start="135.8" dur="5.01">them to shut their mouths and of course</text>
  <text start="138.98" dur="3.6">Robert Miller doesn&amp;#39;t want attention has</text>
  <text start="140.81" dur="3.81">principles and follows them and always</text>
  <text start="142.58" dur="4.769">tells the truth so that sounds kind of</text>
  <text start="144.62" dur="5.009">like maybe an obstacle and then of</text>
  <text start="147.349" dur="3.72">course you&amp;#39;ve got a little generalized</text>
  <text start="149.629" dur="2.851">threat to Congress I don&amp;#39;t know maybe</text>
  <text start="151.069" dur="5.551">not but I&amp;#39;m just saying</text>
  <text start="152.48" dur="6.899">anyway Q says if AG bar has access to</text>
  <text start="156.62" dur="4.56">all classified material how does Mulder</text>
  <text start="159.379" dur="3.481">navigate yeah well that&amp;#39;s really the</text>
  <text start="161.18" dur="3.389">question right that&amp;#39;s exactly why Moore</text>
  <text start="162.86" dur="3.12">doesn&amp;#39;t want to do this because it</text>
  <text start="164.569" dur="4.231">really doesn&amp;#39;t really put him in a good</text>
  <text start="165.98" dur="5.729">position at all and of course the</text>
  <text start="168.8" dur="4.98">average left-leaning unhinged Democrat</text>
  <text start="171.709" dur="3.481">is probably crying for this thinking</text>
  <text start="173.78" dur="3.66">that this is gonna bust everything wide</text>
  <text start="175.19" dur="6.36">open not really understanding that it is</text>
  <text start="177.44" dur="6.9">so gonna bust things wide open if</text>
  <text start="181.55" dur="5.43">Moeller provides false and or misleading</text>
  <text start="184.34" dur="5.07">testimony will AG bar be forced to D</text>
  <text start="186.98" dur="4.35">class all documentation to ensure full</text>
  <text start="189.41" dur="4.83">public awareness of the truth well that</text>
  <text start="191.33" dur="4.29">is precisely what Muller is afraid of he</text>
  <text start="194.24" dur="4.32">knows that the only thing he can really</text>
  <text start="195.62" dur="4.71">talk about are things otherwise if he</text>
  <text start="198.56" dur="4.92">contradicts anything that he&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="200.33" dur="6.45">stated or said bar has the right to open</text>
  <text start="203.48" dur="4.23">it all up and whether Democrats think</text>
  <text start="206.78" dur="2.91">they want it or not</text>
  <text start="207.71" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s probably whether where this is</text>
  <text start="209.69" dur="2.76">gonna go if Muller defers to the</text>
  <text start="211.52" dur="3.69">original report</text>
  <text start="212.45" dur="4.35">but Democrats fake news push a false</text>
  <text start="215.21" dur="5.07">narrative knowing majority of the public</text>
  <text start="216.8" dur="5.16">did not watch the actual hearing will AG</text>
  <text start="220.28" dur="4.08">bar be forced to D class all</text>
  <text start="221.96" dur="4.53">documentation to ensure full public</text>
  <text start="224.36" dur="3.39">awareness of the truth yeah that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="226.49" dur="3.99">really the heart of the matter right</text>
  <text start="227.75" dur="6">Muller is in Iraq and a hard place</text>
  <text start="230.48" dur="6.33">because if he sticks to the story which</text>
  <text start="233.75" dur="5.37">is the smartest thing for him to do then</text>
  <text start="236.81" dur="3.6">this really puts fake news out on Front</text>
  <text start="239.12" dur="2.7">Street because they&amp;#39;re the ones that</text>
  <text start="240.41" dur="3.03">have been crying about this for a long</text>
  <text start="241.82" dur="3.81">time and of course Hollywood doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="243.44" dur="5.1">want to see that either if you remember</text>
  <text start="245.63" dur="6.74">this was just a few weeks back all the</text>
  <text start="248.54" dur="7.29">Hollywood stars like Alyssa Milano and</text>
  <text start="252.37" dur="5.95">her gang uh thespians they did a reading</text>
  <text start="255.83" dur="5.19">of the mole report not really sure how</text>
  <text start="258.32" dur="4.95">that went over but yeah they did and</text>
  <text start="261.02" dur="3.99">they think that this is really busting</text>
  <text start="263.27" dur="3.96">something wide open they don&amp;#39;t realize</text>
  <text start="265.01" dur="3.6">that you know this has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="267.23" dur="2.85">with collusion at this point and all its</text>
  <text start="268.61" dur="3.3">really gonna lead to is the FISA tea</text>
  <text start="270.08" dur="5.22">class so go ahead and do it be ready</text>
  <text start="271.91" dur="5.79">molar be ready JC James Comey be ready</text>
  <text start="275.3" dur="3.96">traitors one and all and all these are</text>
  <text start="277.7" dur="3.54">in brackets so it makes me wonder if</text>
  <text start="279.26" dur="3.39">there&amp;#39;s going to be three drops of</text>
  <text start="281.24" dur="3.99">information three things deep</text>
  <text start="282.65" dur="5.22">Declassified not really sure it likely</text>
  <text start="285.23" dur="4.59">has to do with the mauler hearing I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="287.87" dur="3.18">not so sure this is even going to go</text>
  <text start="289.82" dur="3">through it wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise me if they</text>
  <text start="291.05" dur="3.69">stall it or they cancel it</text>
  <text start="292.82" dur="3.87">we&amp;#39;ll have to see but we all know that</text>
  <text start="294.74" dur="3.87">molar didn&amp;#39;t want to do this and we</text>
  <text start="296.69" dur="3.78">should all know why at this point like I</text>
  <text start="298.61" dur="3.87">said rock and a hard place if he tells</text>
  <text start="300.47" dur="4.38">the truth then fake news gets exposed</text>
  <text start="302.48" dur="4.11">and if you lie then he gets exposed and</text>
  <text start="304.85" dur="3.45">we declassify so either way it looks</text>
  <text start="306.59" dur="3.03">like we&amp;#39;re probably gonna D class anyway</text>
  <text start="308.3" dur="4.38">but it&amp;#39;s just gonna come out and slow</text>
  <text start="309.62" dur="5.07">bacony cheesy bites thanks for playing</text>
  <text start="312.68" dur="4.799">if I said goes both ways meaning that we</text>
  <text start="314.69" dur="5.37">can put faces on you which means we</text>
  <text start="317.479" dur="5.491">likely have your xbox coms</text>

  <text start="322.97" dur="5.19">whatsapp and your viber and your WeChat</text>
  <text start="325.76" dur="3.84">and I can&amp;#39;t think of any more right now</text>
  <text start="328.16" dur="6.21">so we&amp;#39;re just gonna move on to the next</text>
