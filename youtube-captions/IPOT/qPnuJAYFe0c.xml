  <text start="762.89" dur="6.45">that and what should we expect from this</text>
  <text start="764.87" dur="6.66">upcoming FISA IG report well the first</text>
  <text start="769.34" dur="5.22">ID report that you mentioned was just a</text>
  <text start="771.53" dur="5.22">sliver how Jim Comey handled the memos</text>
  <text start="774.56" dur="3.42">that he created of his conversations</text>
  <text start="776.75" dur="3.63">with President Trump some of which</text>
  <text start="777.98" dur="4.38">contained classified information and of</text>
  <text start="780.38" dur="4.08">course the Inspector General found that</text>
  <text start="782.36" dur="5.1">Jim Comey mishandled that disclosed it</text>
  <text start="784.46" dur="4.61">without authorization much like Hillary</text>
  <text start="787.46" dur="3.75">Clinton though despite was handling</text>
  <text start="789.07" dur="3.79">classified information he was not</text>
  <text start="791.21" dur="4.68">charged I know that there&amp;#39;s been a lot</text>
  <text start="792.86" dur="5.13">of focus about why that is not the case</text>
  <text start="795.89" dur="4.11">but to me the most important takeaway of</text>
  <text start="797.99" dur="4.44">that first part was that the Inspector</text>
  <text start="800" dur="5.6">General found that Jim Comey let his</text>
  <text start="802.43" dur="6.349">personal desire for a specific outcome</text>
  <text start="805.6" dur="5.88">Donald Trump to influence his official</text>
  <text start="808.779" dur="4.531">actions the Inspector General an Obama</text>
  <text start="811.48" dur="4.2">appointed inspector general a lot of</text>
  <text start="813.31" dur="4.41">partisan Republican found that Jim Comey</text>
  <text start="815.68" dur="4.56">had targeted Donald Trump even before</text>
  <text start="817.72" dur="4.59">their first meeting and so you know I</text>
  <text start="820.24" dur="5.61">think that&amp;#39;s an important takeaway as we</text>
  <text start="822.31" dur="6.209">look to the second FISA abuse part of</text>
  <text start="825.85" dur="3.96">the inspector general&amp;#39;s report I think</text>
  <text start="828.519" dur="2.791">people should feel good about the fact</text>
  <text start="829.81" dur="3.54">that you have an inspector general who</text>
  <text start="831.31" dur="4.62">has criminally referred now both the</text>
  <text start="833.35" dur="5.19">director of the FBI and the Deputy</text>
  <text start="835.93" dur="4.32">Director of the FBI Jim Comey in aiding</text>
  <text start="838.54" dur="4.26">the cave and that&amp;#39;s the persons that</text>
  <text start="840.25" dur="8.759">that is looking at the issues of FISA</text>
  <text start="842.8" dur="8.37">abuse criminal referrals do tell knowing</text>
  <text start="849.009" dur="4.38">about you know his life Jim call me no</text>
  <text start="851.17" dur="3.96">charges so far so so what are you</text>
  <text start="853.389" dur="3.661">expecting in terms of this decision that</text>
  <text start="855.13" dur="4.28">the DOJ needs to make in terms of a</text>
  <text start="857.05" dur="5.13">potential indictment of Andrew McCabe</text>
  <text start="859.41" dur="4.03">yeah I think that&amp;#39;s a lot of people a</text>
  <text start="862.18" dur="2.55">lot of interest in that and I think</text>
  <text start="863.44" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s going to be a decision that has</text>
  <text start="864.73" dur="5.7">to be made very quickly to remind your</text>
  <text start="868.66" dur="3.72">viewers it was last year that the</text>
  <text start="870.43" dur="5.07">Inspector General found that Deputy</text>
  <text start="872.38" dur="5.1">Director McCain authorized the</text>
  <text start="875.5" dur="4.17">disclosure of sensitive investigative</text>
  <text start="877.48" dur="4.14">information to a reporter and then more</text>
  <text start="879.67" dur="3">importantly repeatedly lied about it to</text>
  <text start="881.62" dur="5.25">investigators</text>
  <text start="882.67" dur="6.69">so the as your viewers also know the</text>
  <text start="886.87" dur="4.8">Department of Justice has through the</text>
  <text start="889.36" dur="4.11">special counsel recently made a cottage</text>
  <text start="891.67" dur="4.529">industry out of charging people like</text>
  <text start="893.47" dur="5.64">general Flynn and George papadopolis for</text>
  <text start="896.199" dur="6">lying to investigators here you had the</text>
  <text start="899.11" dur="5.49">inspector general stating that either</text>
  <text start="902.199" dur="4.531">the Cade did that multiple times and the</text>
  <text start="904.6" dur="4.02">magic words did so intentionally and</text>
  <text start="906.73" dur="5.729">knowingly I think the Department of</text>
  <text start="908.62" dur="6.75">Justice is going to have to indict any</text>
  <text start="912.459" dur="5.281">McCabe simply because to do otherwise</text>
  <text start="915.37" dur="5.279">would be to admit that there are</text>
  <text start="917.74" dur="6.599">separate standards for the people doing</text>
  <text start="920.649" dur="5.491">the same thing for the same conduct so</text>
  <text start="924.339" dur="5.19">just to be clear you think the DOJ</text>
  <text start="926.14" dur="5.129">and items on the Cape yeah okay so if</text>
  <text start="929.529" dur="4.711">you remember a couple weeks back we were</text>
  <text start="931.269" dur="5.701">talking about James nobodies homie Co me</text>
  <text start="934.24" dur="5.19">and all those messages that he was</text>
  <text start="936.97" dur="3.66">sharing those confidential messages</text>
  <text start="939.43" dur="3.24">right well you&amp;#39;re not supposed to be</text>
  <text start="940.63" dur="3.84">doing that and of course everybody was</text>
  <text start="942.67" dur="3.75">up in arms thinking why isn&amp;#39;t this guy</text>
  <text start="944.47" dur="4.44">getting indicted for that well this is</text>
  <text start="946.42" dur="4.68">likely why because once we find out</text>
  <text start="948.91" dur="4.08">what&amp;#39;s going on McCabe that is more than</text>
  <text start="951.1" dur="3.75">likely gonna go straight up to Comey and</text>
  <text start="952.99" dur="3.3">it looks like there could be an</text>
  <text start="954.85" dur="3.57">indictment coming down the pipe for</text>
  <text start="956.29" dur="3.39">mckay him a lot of people there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="958.42" dur="3.12">little bit of disagreement there</text>
  <text start="959.68" dur="3.93">that&amp;#39;s what Ratcliffe goes on to say</text>
  <text start="961.54" dur="4.14">there but I think many people think this</text>
  <text start="963.61" dur="3.69">would be the obvious decision and of</text>
  <text start="965.68" dur="3.39">course if it doesn&amp;#39;t happen then we will</text>
  <text start="967.3" dur="4.83">know that truly we don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="969.07" dur="5.04">justice in this world but Andrew McCabe</text>
  <text start="972.13" dur="4.56">has done all the things that you would</text>
  <text start="974.11" dur="4.349">imagine a guilty person to do go on CN n</text>
  <text start="976.69" dur="3.36">get a little gig there of course he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1182.179" dur="4.021">yet but that would really expedite this</text>
  <text start="1184.97" dur="3.299">process but it does seem like</text>
  <text start="1186.2" dur="4.469">Christopher Rea is really trying to slow</text>

  <text start="1241.759" dur="4.471">you go seems very very strange right but</text>
  <text start="1243.889" dur="4.201">what&amp;#39;s even more strange is the person</text>
  <text start="1246.23" dur="4.02">who retweeted it was Chuckie Schumer</text>

  <text start="1269.75" dur="4.59">that&amp;#39;s a good thing to do for your dog</text>
  <text start="1271.85" dur="4.199">seems like a bad place to have your dog</text>
  <text start="1274.34" dur="3.48">which is why I think this is extremely</text>
  <text start="1276.049" dur="3.451">suspect and if you&amp;#39;ve been following my</text>
  <text start="1277.82" dur="3.359">channel for a while you know that we&amp;#39;re</text>
