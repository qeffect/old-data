  <text start="120.709" dur="4.05">answer questions in a private setting</text>
  <text start="122.45" dur="5.369">Muller only spoke in public about his</text>
  <text start="124.759" dur="4.681">investigation once in May Muller hosted</text>
  <text start="127.819" dur="3.361">a press conference he did not take any</text>

  <text start="145.129" dur="4.11">left the issue open a move that</text>
  <text start="147.44" dur="3.84">Democrats took as a signal to ramp up</text>
  <text start="149.239" dur="3.991">their investigations all right so here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="151.28" dur="3.959">what the Democrats are looking for among</text>

  <text start="155.239" dur="4.411">Trump&amp;#39;s reported call to then White</text>
  <text start="157.25" dur="4.349">House Counsel Don began to fire Muller</text>

  <text start="190.65" dur="5.19">and all I&amp;#39;m wondering if this has to do</text>
  <text start="192.84" dur="4.679">with our placeholders that have been</text>
  <text start="195.84" dur="3.569">sitting in brackets and we may see this</text>

  <text start="214.62" dur="3.539">d-class or whatever I don&amp;#39;t want to keep</text>
  <text start="216.599" dur="3.06">predicting FISA d-class because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="218.159" dur="2.94">amazing how many things have happened in</text>

  <text start="221.099" dur="3.121">was going to come out can&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="222.599" dur="3.211">nothing&amp;#39;s happened many things have</text>

  <text start="733.26" dur="4.62">Ezra Cohen watt Nick was a top flynn guy</text>
  <text start="736.14" dur="3.36">Flynn was real high on this guy and</text>

  <text start="742.08" dur="3.72">trained he was down on the farm with a</text>
  <text start="744.029" dur="3.691">lot of those cats and a lot of those</text>

  <text start="749.91" dur="5.34">spying on all the clowns over there at</text>
  <text start="752.04" dur="4.59">the CIA so this would explain why they</text>
  <text start="755.25" dur="3.54">wanted to get rid of him and in place</text>
  <text start="756.63" dur="4.14">replace him with this Weiss Gould who</text>
  <text start="758.79" dur="4.59">like I said helped draft the talking</text>
  <text start="760.77" dur="4.62">points for the Benghazi hearings so that</text>
  <text start="763.38" dur="5.04">would suggest to me that Ezra : watt</text>
  <text start="765.39" dur="4.65">Nick has the goods on a lot of folks and</text>
  <text start="768.42" dur="4.919">I want to also point out that he worked</text>
  <text start="770.04" dur="5.94">with the DoD in Haiti so I would imagine</text>
  <text start="773.339" dur="4.471">being so close to Flynn and having the</text>
  <text start="775.98" dur="4.049">connections that he knows he knows a lot</text>
  <text start="777.81" dur="4.2">about the Middle East this guy seems to</text>
  <text start="780.029" dur="4.621">be an expert in quite a few different</text>
  <text start="782.01" dur="4.079">things and he likely has the goods and</text>
  <text start="784.65" dur="4.17">if Flint knows where the bodies are</text>
  <text start="786.089" dur="5.521">buried likely Cohen Wanek has a pretty</text>
  <text start="788.82" dur="5.49">good idea we also know that Cohen want</text>
  <text start="791.61" dur="4.65">Nick met with Devin Nunez and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="794.31" dur="3.96">I would imagine that that&amp;#39;s how Devin</text>
  <text start="796.26" dur="4.74">Nunez got his information in the first</text>
