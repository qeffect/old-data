  <text start="119.59" dur="4.199">bank the Vatican Bank is assessing that</text>
  <text start="122.259" dur="2.88">there was some misdeeds done at the</text>
  <text start="123.789" dur="3.93">Vatican Bank which is rather ironic</text>
  <text start="125.139" dur="5.611">considering the Vatican Bank&amp;#39;s long</text>
  <text start="127.719" dur="4.35">penchant for knuckle head agree now</text>
  <text start="130.75" dur="2.88">before I continue I just want to point</text>
  <text start="132.069" dur="3.511">out that I&amp;#39;m gonna probably toss out the</text>
  <text start="133.63" dur="3.78">term maybe Catholic Church from time to</text>
  <text start="135.58" dur="3.48">time please understand I am talking</text>
  <text start="137.41" dur="2.909">about these higher ups I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="139.06" dur="3.24">the Vatican I&amp;#39;m not talking about the</text>
  <text start="140.319" dur="4.5">Catholic congregation which may include</text>

  <text start="150.49" dur="3.9">very top and you know sometimes</text>
  <text start="152.95" dur="3.75">just gonna use I don&amp;#39;t want to basically</text>
  <text start="154.39" dur="4.11">debate over semantics here but we are</text>
  <text start="156.7" dur="3.48">talking about essentially the upper</text>
  <text start="158.5" dur="5.13">echelon here of the Catholic Church</text>
  <text start="160.18" dur="5.52">which is indeed a mess now if you&amp;#39;ve not</text>
  <text start="163.63" dur="3.81">seen this video I highly suggest that</text>
  <text start="165.7" dur="3.36">you do this raid I think was very</text>
  <text start="167.44" dur="3.66">significant we&amp;#39;re gonna talk a little</text>
  <text start="169.06" dur="3.84">bit more about that today but we also</text>
  <text start="171.1" dur="4.8">talked about this real estate guy</text>
  <text start="172.9" dur="5.61">Danielle boudin II whose helicopter had</text>
  <text start="175.9" dur="4.14">crashed in New York some months ago and</text>
  <text start="178.51" dur="3.24">guys probably remembered that story but</text>
  <text start="180.04" dur="3.66">please go back and check out this video</text>
  <text start="181.75" dur="3.36">cardinal sins if you want to get some</text>
  <text start="183.7" dur="4.08">base knowledge for what we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="185.11" dur="4.86">about today now this is an article from</text>
  <text start="187.78" dur="4.05">the Catholic Herald and this is dated</text>
  <text start="189.97" dur="3.66">from the 10th entitled the Vatican money</text>
  <text start="191.83" dur="3.18">mystery that leads back to London and</text>
  <text start="193.63" dur="4.02">we&amp;#39;re gonna kind of recap some of this</text>
  <text start="195.01" dur="4.5">here the Vatican police raided offices</text>
  <text start="197.65" dur="4.02">in the Secretariat of State and the</text>
  <text start="199.51" dur="4.259">financial oversight office known as the</text>
  <text start="201.67" dur="5.039">F or AI F scuse me financial information</text>
  <text start="203.769" dur="5.071">authority last week five officials were</text>
  <text start="206.709" dur="4.201">suspended for laypeople and one</text>
  <text start="208.84" dur="3.57">Monsignor the incident made headlines</text>
  <text start="210.91" dur="3.81">and then fell off the radar pretty</text>
  <text start="212.41" dur="4.799">quickly why yeah well we&amp;#39;re gonna figure</text>
  <text start="214.72" dur="3.989">it out part of the reason is that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="217.209" dur="3.06">been tough to get details regarding the</text>
  <text start="218.709" dur="3.721">case and I will say this this is an</text>
  <text start="220.269" dur="3.571">incredibly complicated case that seems</text>
  <text start="222.43" dur="3.929">to go back quite some years</text>
  <text start="223.84" dur="3.929">let&amp;#39;s preso reported that the seizure of</text>
  <text start="226.359" dur="3.75">documents and hardware from the</text>
  <text start="227.769" dur="3.72">Secretary of State and the suspensions</text>
  <text start="230.109" dur="3.391">were in connection with a series of</text>
  <text start="231.489" dur="3.661">operations related to a two hundred</text>
  <text start="233.5" dur="2.91">million euro and it was actually turned</text>
  <text start="235.15" dur="3.149">to be out a whole lot more than that</text>
  <text start="236.41" dur="3.99">about about two hundred forty seven</text>
  <text start="238.299" dur="5.041">million dollars they&amp;#39;re saying real</text>
  <text start="240.4" dur="4.8">estate deal in London gone sideways now</text>
  <text start="243.34" dur="4.56">I want to stop right there before we</text>
  <text start="245.2" dur="4.409">move on and remind you that if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="247.9" dur="4.26">been following queueing on a tall queue</text>
  <text start="249.609" dur="4.111">has referenced the movie Godfather three</text>
  <text start="252.16" dur="5.129">and I was making the point in my last</text>
  <text start="253.72" dur="5.31">video entitled cardinal sins that this</text>
  <text start="257.289" dur="3.841">seems to be playing out very similarly</text>
  <text start="259.03" dur="2.519">if you remember the the plot of this</text>
  <text start="261.13" dur="3.33">movie</text>
  <text start="261.549" dur="4.591">Don Corleone II who was kind of trying</text>
  <text start="264.46" dur="4.29">to clean up his act decides to go ahead</text>
  <text start="266.14" dur="5.1">and help out the struggling Catholic</text>
  <text start="268.75" dur="5.19">Church with tons and tons of money but</text>
  <text start="271.24" dur="5.67">he does it in exchange for shares in the</text>
  <text start="273.94" dur="4.59">mobely re which is a basically a massive</text>
  <text start="276.91" dur="3.479">international real estate organization</text>
  <text start="278.53" dur="3.42">that&amp;#39;s really really important because</text>
  <text start="280.389" dur="4.741">we seem to see some of this stuff</text>
  <text start="281.95" dur="4.71">playing out right here now it says that</text>
  <text start="285.13" dur="3.21">this realist II real</text>
  <text start="286.66" dur="3.99">they deal excuse me in London gone</text>
  <text start="288.34" dur="4.29">sideways I had a hard time figuring out</text>
  <text start="290.65" dur="3.63">what which deal it was right off the bat</text>
  <text start="292.63" dur="3.8">but it looks like it&amp;#39;s this area right</text>
  <text start="294.28" dur="5.88">here in this kanzen tin neighbourhood of</text>
  <text start="296.43" dur="6.28">London and oddly enough it seems to be</text>
  <text start="300.16" dur="3.6">kind of a newer area of tons and tons of</text>
  <text start="302.71" dur="2.31">apartments you can see right there on</text>
  <text start="303.76" dur="3.84">the scent of your screen it&amp;#39;s tons of</text>
  <text start="305.02" dur="4.59">apartments I just have the 176</text>
  <text start="307.6" dur="4.44">Kensington ping but it looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="309.61" dur="5.91">this whole area that they went in on and</text>
  <text start="312.04" dur="5.7">it didn&amp;#39;t do so well and so they kind of</text>
  <text start="315.52" dur="3.78">tried to remove the Catholic Church from</text>
  <text start="317.74" dur="3.45">some of the responsibility which is what</text>
  <text start="319.3" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about here but like I</text>
  <text start="321.19" dur="4.53">said I didn&amp;#39;t see any key buildings it</text>
  <text start="322.99" dur="4.62">was more of this development that seemed</text>
  <text start="325.72" dur="4.89">to have gone bad now let&amp;#39;s go back to</text>
