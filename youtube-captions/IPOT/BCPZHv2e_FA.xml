  <text start="87.27" dur="3.87">accountability of actions taken and then</text>
  <text start="89.579" dur="3.601">this was what was done essentially in</text>

  <text start="93.18" dur="3.92">joint investigation into the decisions</text>

  <text start="104.04" dur="6.06">regarding the FBI&amp;#39;s decision-making in</text>
  <text start="106.28" dur="6.01">2016 and 17 on March 22nd the House</text>
  <text start="110.1" dur="3.93">Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena to</text>
  <text start="112.29" dur="3.42">the Department of Justice for documents</text>
  <text start="114.03" dur="4.589">pursuant to the committee&amp;#39;s joint</text>
  <text start="115.71" dur="4.769">investigation and on April 11th chairman</text>
  <text start="118.619" dur="4.621">Goodlatte and chairman Gowdy met with a</text>
  <text start="120.479" dur="4.68">US attorney John Locke to discuss the</text>
  <text start="123.24" dur="3.96">committee&amp;#39;s access to documents related</text>
  <text start="125.159" dur="6.3">to our joint investigation okay remember</text>
  <text start="127.2" dur="6.63">that was back in April so Gowdy resigned</text>
  <text start="131.459" dur="4.861">and he said that he</text>
  <text start="133.83" dur="4.41">wanted to go into back into the judicial</text>
  <text start="136.32" dur="3.54">system of course has been a lot of</text>
  <text start="138.24" dur="3.84">question as to what role he would be</text>
  <text start="139.86" dur="4.95">taking on q says what role did he play</text>
  <text start="142.08" dur="4.14">regarding house investigations well he</text>
  <text start="144.81" dur="4.5">was the House Oversight and Government</text>
  <text start="146.22" dur="6">Reform Committee Chairman and then we</text>
  <text start="149.31" dur="5.76">had good Lots resignation last year too</text>
  <text start="152.22" dur="4.5">what role did he play regarding house</text>
  <text start="155.07" dur="4.35">investigation well he was the House</text>
  <text start="156.72" dur="4.98">Judiciary Chairman and then we have here</text>
  <text start="159.42" dur="4.29">three times house to set it how Senate</text>
  <text start="161.7" dur="3.72">House Senate so does that mean that</text>
  <text start="163.71" dur="4.05">we&amp;#39;re transferring things from the house</text>
  <text start="165.42" dur="5.4">to the Senate if you remember when Gowdy</text>
  <text start="167.76" dur="4.56">resigned he said he was kind of nebulous</text>
  <text start="170.82" dur="3.06">about what he said he was going to do</text>
  <text start="172.32" dur="5.37">but he did say that he wanted to get</text>
  <text start="173.88" dur="5.54">back into the judicial system so now</text>
  <text start="177.69" dur="4.86">obviously he wasn&amp;#39;t running for Senator</text>
  <text start="179.42" dur="5.11">but who knows what role he might be</text>
  <text start="182.55" dur="5.34">playing but the idea that I&amp;#39;m getting</text>
  <text start="184.53" dur="6.12">here is that all of this with good lots</text>
  <text start="187.89" dur="5.28">resignation and gaudi&amp;#39;s resignation all</text>
  <text start="190.65" dur="5.04">this material got transferred over to</text>
  <text start="193.17" dur="5.88">the Senate and of course the Senate is</text>
  <text start="195.69" dur="5.579">really the where all the things happen</text>
  <text start="199.05" dur="3.57">within the judiciary system really needs</text>
  <text start="201.269" dur="3.061">to start going through the Senate and</text>
  <text start="202.62" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s why the Senate was so important q</text>
  <text start="204.33" dur="4.76">says trust Grassley well why trust</text>
  <text start="206.61" dur="6.15">Grassi because he&amp;#39;s the Senate Judiciary</text>
  <text start="209.09" dur="5.11">Chairman house of cards so it looks like</text>
  <text start="212.76" dur="3.9">what they were really trying to do was</text>
  <text start="214.2" dur="4.5">play for the Senate all along get the</text>
  <text start="216.66" dur="3.359">Democrats to play for the house but the</text>
  <text start="218.7" dur="2.91">fact of the matter is if the house</text>
  <text start="220.019" dur="3.121">thinks they&amp;#39;re going to impeach Trump</text>
  <text start="221.61" dur="3.26">they got another thing coming and all</text>
  <text start="223.14" dur="3.629">they have to do is look back to</text>
  <text start="224.87" dur="4.69">basically when the same kind of thing</text>
  <text start="226.769" dur="4.981">happened for Bill Clinton you know this</text>
  <text start="229.56" dur="4.29">is not an easy thing to impeach a</text>
  <text start="231.75" dur="2.73">sitting president and that&amp;#39;s just not</text>
  <text start="233.85" dur="4.38">gonna happen</text>
  <text start="234.48" dur="5.25">q says military planning at its finest I</text>
  <text start="238.23" dur="5.039">want to point out too that chuck</text>
  <text start="239.73" dur="6.479">Grassley was looking into B 702 s this</text>
  <text start="243.269" dur="4.621">is from back in May of 2016 I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="246.209" dur="3.541">gonna read all this for you here but</text>
  <text start="247.89" dur="4.5">this was where he was questioning the</text>
  <text start="249.75" dur="4.98">section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act</text>
  <text start="252.39" dur="4.319">and he was trying to grill the Obama</text>
  <text start="254.73" dur="4.259">administration about this so Grassley</text>
  <text start="256.709" dur="4.53">knows what&amp;#39;s up he&amp;#39;s known what&amp;#39;s up for</text>
  <text start="258.989" dur="4.891">a long time I have a feeling that all of</text>
  <text start="261.239" dur="4.8">these recommendations and appointments</text>
  <text start="263.88" dur="3.009">will go over to the Senate now Chuck</text>
  <text start="266.039" dur="3.331">Grassley</text>
  <text start="266.889" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;ll be the man heading this up and</text>
  <text start="269.37" dur="5.62">that is military planning at its finest</text>
  <text start="272.379" dur="6.09">and my suspicions are confirmed here in</text>

  <text start="337.659" dur="3.75">house of cards are we talking about a</text>
  <text start="339.61" dur="5.519">card trick we talking about sleight of</text>
  <text start="341.409" dur="6.81">hand q says the Senate was the target</text>
  <text start="345.129" dur="4.71">corker plus flake removed and remember</text>
  <text start="348.219" dur="3.151">those guys were never Trump er so we had</text>
  <text start="349.839" dur="3.75">to get them out of the way and we did</text>
  <text start="351.37" dur="4.59">how do you catch a fish well you gotta</text>
  <text start="353.589" dur="5.85">put something on the hook right mission</text>
  <text start="355.96" dur="5.519">forward these people are stupid so I get</text>
  <text start="359.439" dur="4.561">the idea that this like upset all on</text>
  <text start="361.479" dur="4.71">this threat of D class has always been</text>
  <text start="364" dur="3.839">almost worse than the D class itself and</text>
  <text start="366.189" dur="3.271">of course for us we&amp;#39;re screaming where</text>
  <text start="367.839" dur="3.57">is the beef because we want our whopper</text>
  <text start="369.46" dur="3.419">with cheese right but it looks to me</text>
  <text start="371.409" dur="3.151">like when you put that on the hook you</text>
  <text start="372.879" dur="4.32">get a bunch of fish coming and lots of</text>
  <text start="374.56" dur="5.129">people are probably talking and the only</text>
  <text start="377.199" dur="3.72">way to really push forward is with the</text>
  <text start="379.689" dur="2.79">Senate and believe me if you want to</text>
  <text start="380.919" dur="2.37">control one of the two it&amp;#39;s the Senate</text>
  <text start="382.479" dur="3.36">that you really want to control</text>
  <text start="383.289" dur="5.041">obviously we would have loved to have</text>
  <text start="385.839" dur="5.04">had more wins in the house but we&amp;#39;d like</text>
  <text start="388.33" dur="4.41">got a lot of governorships and we held</text>
  <text start="390.879" dur="3.54">really really strong we actually picked</text>
  <text start="392.74" dur="4.079">up some ground in the Senate so I think</text>
  <text start="394.419" dur="4.321">this is a great thing these people are</text>
  <text start="396.819" dur="3.741">stupid physis should be able to move</text>
  <text start="398.74" dur="5.63">forward and i don&amp;#39;t see it</text>
  <text start="400.56" dur="6.15">being able to get wrapped up the way you</text>
  <text start="404.37" dur="4.11">know we might think it is now I still</text>
  <text start="406.71" dur="3.87">want to let more information kind of</text>
  <text start="408.48" dur="3.659">come forward with all this but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="410.58" dur="3.45">sort of the way that I&amp;#39;m looking at it</text>
  <text start="412.139" dur="3.961">at least at this point so there are your</text>
  <text start="414.03" dur="4.56">most recent cue posts all in all I think</text>
  <text start="416.1" dur="5.01">it was a pretty good day it looks to me</text>
  <text start="418.59" dur="4.47">like all systems are go the senate is</text>
  <text start="421.11" dur="4.08">highly empowered and remember those are</text>
  <text start="423.06" dur="4.68">six-year terms as opposed to the lesser</text>
  <text start="425.19" dur="5.67">house which is two-year terms so at the</text>
  <text start="427.74" dur="5.01">very worst case scenario we could be</text>
  <text start="430.86" dur="3.66">looking at doing this again in 2020 when</text>
  <text start="432.75" dur="3.63">it&amp;#39;s time for President Trump to be</text>
  <text start="434.52" dur="3.63">running for reelection and I think he</text>
  <text start="436.38" dur="4.2">set himself a stage doing all these</text>
  <text start="438.15" dur="4.92">massive rallies look he&amp;#39;s been trying to</text>
  <text start="440.58" dur="4.77">sell you know congressmen and Senators</text>
  <text start="443.07" dur="4.95">and all this meanwhile he&amp;#39;s been selling</text>
  <text start="445.35" dur="4.74">himself all the you know all along and</text>
  <text start="448.02" dur="3.69">he&amp;#39;s really the attraction so I think</text>
  <text start="450.09" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;re gonna do really well there I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="451.71" dur="3.81">think impeachment is gonna gain as much</text>
  <text start="453.66" dur="3.72">steam as they&amp;#39;d like to say that it will</text>
  <text start="455.52" dur="3.81">although I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;re gonna try and</text>
  <text start="457.38" dur="4.32">wrap it up as much as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="459.33" dur="4.32">now if we do get a fire to D class and</text>
  <text start="461.7" dur="3.99">it ends up exposing a bunch of people</text>
  <text start="463.65" dur="4.889">who knows what kind of seats might get</text>
  <text start="465.69" dur="4.38">vacated in the process now I&amp;#39;m not going</text>
  <text start="468.539" dur="3.721">to count on that right now because we</text>
  <text start="470.07" dur="4.29">don&amp;#39;t know I think right now just taking</text>
  <text start="472.26" dur="4.8">it at face value we sitting pretty well</text>
  <text start="474.36" dur="5.25">but that&amp;#39;s a possibility so if i sadi</text>
  <text start="477.06" dur="4.53">class opens up some seats it could lead</text>
  <text start="479.61" dur="4.17">to even better things and I think either</text>
  <text start="481.59" dur="4.32">way we are moving forward with the queue</text>
  <text start="483.78" dur="4.71">plan I don&amp;#39;t see the queue plan losing</text>
  <text start="485.91" dur="3.72">much steam in all of this obviously we</text>
  <text start="488.49" dur="3.06">would love to have more seats in the</text>
  <text start="489.63" dur="3.84">house but that&amp;#39;s the way it is and they</text>
  <text start="491.55" dur="3.9">went really hard after and I think some</text>
  <text start="493.47" dur="4.35">of these candidates are probably gonna</text>
  <text start="495.45" dur="4.38">be duds so in a couple years we may be</text>
  <text start="497.82" dur="3.87">looking at them fizzling me now or not</text>
  <text start="499.83" dur="4.5">who knows maybe they&amp;#39;ll absolutely be</text>
  <text start="501.69" dur="4.56">you know embraced by the left woth to</text>
  <text start="504.33" dur="5.49">see how it goes but that&amp;#39;s where we sit</text>
  <text start="506.25" dur="5.07">right now now there is a video is an</text>
  <text start="509.82" dur="3.99">interview with Lindsey Graham he was on</text>
  <text start="511.32" dur="5.519">Fox earlier who was absolutely atrocious</text>
  <text start="513.81" dur="4.529">Fox&amp;#39;s just become complete trash and</text>
  <text start="516.839" dur="2.88">they showed it shouldn&amp;#39;t be much of a</text>
  <text start="518.339" dur="3.241">surprise just look when they&amp;#39;re funded</text>
  <text start="519.719" dur="4.981">but yeah I think they&amp;#39;re gonna lose a</text>
  <text start="521.58" dur="5.52">lot of viewership after today&amp;#39;s handling</text>
  <text start="524.7" dur="4.71">of you know kind of calling the the</text>
  <text start="527.1" dur="3.989">house win before it before it was even</text>
  <text start="529.41" dur="3">called for it was just really kind of</text>
  <text start="531.089" dur="1.961">salt in the wound it was really kind of</text>
  <text start="532.41" dur="2.77">an ugly</text>
  <text start="533.05" dur="3.72">handling it but the interview with</text>
  <text start="535.18" dur="3.03">Lindsey Graham was very good he brought</text>
  <text start="536.77" dur="2.91">up some very key points that I&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="538.21" dur="2.7">bring up with you too I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="539.68" dur="2.43">always important for us to look at</text>
  <text start="540.91" dur="3.36">ourselves and what we could do better</text>
  <text start="542.11" dur="3.78">and Lindsey Graham made a good point</text>
  <text start="544.27" dur="3.78">about President Trump not really</text>
  <text start="545.89" dur="5.07">reaching kind of this middle-aged white</text>
  <text start="548.05" dur="4.62">women demographic and he&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="550.96" dur="3.96">disenfranchised a lot of them now</text>
  <text start="552.67" dur="4.02">obviously not all but there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="554.92" dur="5.1">them out there that didn&amp;#39;t vote for him</text>
  <text start="556.69" dur="6.15">and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if we see</text>
  <text start="560.02" dur="4.68">Donald Trump kind of change his tone a</text>
  <text start="562.84" dur="4.11">little bit really over the next couple</text>
  <text start="564.7" dur="3.72">years of course you know he&amp;#39;s a he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="566.95" dur="3.03">work in progress right he&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="568.42" dur="3.15">particular politician we love him for</text>
  <text start="569.98" dur="3.18">that but at the end of the day there are</text>
  <text start="571.57" dur="3.42">a lot of people that get rubbed the</text>
  <text start="573.16" dur="3.78">wrong way by the way he speaks and I</text>
  <text start="574.99" dur="3.99">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s unfair for us to</text>
  <text start="576.94" dur="4.23">recognize that if we want to be able to</text>
  <text start="578.98" dur="4.83">prove improve upon our numbers over the</text>
  <text start="581.17" dur="4.83">next couple years so I would be</text>
  <text start="583.81" dur="4.74">surprised if we start to see a softening</text>
  <text start="586" dur="4.11">president as we go on especially if we</text>
  <text start="588.55" dur="4.35">want to see four more years but like I</text>
  <text start="590.11" dur="4.2">said he set himself a nice stage going</text>
  <text start="592.9" dur="4.65">around in campaigning doing these</text>
  <text start="594.31" dur="5.76">rallies at breakneck speed and he really</text>
  <text start="597.55" dur="4.17">sells himself perfectly sadly there were</text>
  <text start="600.07" dur="3.72">a lot of duds that he was trying to sell</text>
  <text start="601.72" dur="4.74">and quite honestly we can credit him for</text>
  <text start="603.79" dur="5.94">a few wins today so President Trump</text>
  <text start="606.46" dur="4.95">really did his job I think overall it</text>
  <text start="609.73" dur="5.1">was a great day there&amp;#39;s lots to take</text>
  <text start="611.41" dur="5.16">from this and you know we&amp;#39;ll just have</text>
  <text start="614.83" dur="3.45">to see how it plays out but I do think</text>
  <text start="616.57" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;ll see some voter fraud stuff go on</text>
  <text start="618.28" dur="4.47">over the next week or so and we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="620.8" dur="3.78">to see how that shakes out and where we</text>
  <text start="622.75" dur="4.05">end up sitting who knows we may end up</text>
  <text start="624.58" dur="4.23">gaining or losing ground but I imagine</text>
  <text start="626.8" dur="4.38">we would only stand to gain when it far</text>
  <text start="628.81" dur="4.26">comes to that so there you go that&amp;#39;s my</text>
