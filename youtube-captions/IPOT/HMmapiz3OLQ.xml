  <text start="47.1" dur="7.07">the hunters become the hunted</text>
  <text start="49.32" dur="4.85">[Music]</text>
  <text start="55.93" dur="3.12">he&amp;#39;s on to something and we&amp;#39;re on to</text>
  <text start="57.699" dur="4.141">something too we&amp;#39;re on to some cue pose</text>
  <text start="59.05" dur="6.81">how many we got John John yes and did</text>
  <text start="61.84" dur="6.54">you know that 9 is one less than 10 yes</text>
  <text start="65.86" dur="6.66">that is a true story it&amp;#39;s been confirmed</text>
  <text start="68.38" dur="5.94">by science already 3427 55 minutes after</text>
  <text start="72.52" dur="3.93">the hour of 1 we get this YouTube link</text>
  <text start="74.32" dur="4.65">here Q says these people are sick</text>
  <text start="76.45" dur="4.59">hunters become the hunted and the</text>
  <text start="78.97" dur="4.56">youtube link takes you here and here we</text>
  <text start="81.04" dur="6">are at little st. James Island otherwise</text>
  <text start="83.53" dur="5.43">known as Epstein&amp;#39;s pedophile island yeah</text>
  <text start="87.04" dur="3.45">it&amp;#39;s not as charming as little st. James</text>
  <text start="88.96" dur="3.21">is it now we&amp;#39;re gonna have time to watch</text>
  <text start="90.49" dur="3.36">this whole video it&amp;#39;s 4 minutes and 51</text>
  <text start="92.17" dur="3.69">seconds and I&amp;#39;m sure many of you have</text>
  <text start="93.85" dur="4.32">already seen it so I&amp;#39;m just gonna take</text>
  <text start="95.86" dur="4.289">you through a few highlights that I</text>
  <text start="98.17" dur="7.229">found the first one here is at 1 minute</text>
  <text start="100.149" dur="7.651">in 17 seconds so we see this little</text>
  <text start="105.399" dur="4.591">field of grass here it appears to be</text>
  <text start="107.8" dur="3.9">elevated because you&amp;#39;ve got stairs here</text>
  <text start="109.99" dur="3.48">and a ramp which leads me to think that</text>
  <text start="111.7" dur="3.54">they use something that&amp;#39;s either wheeled</text>
  <text start="113.47" dur="4.53">or whatever to be accessible to this</text>
  <text start="115.24" dur="4.56">spot not exactly sure but you can see</text>
  <text start="118" dur="3.09">there as an impression on the grass and</text>
  <text start="119.8" dur="3">it&amp;#39;s actually marked by these little</text>
  <text start="121.09" dur="3.75">yellow markers I&amp;#39;m not sure if you can</text>
  <text start="122.8" dur="4.019">see them but you can definitely see the</text>
  <text start="124.84" dur="3.899">impression I&amp;#39;m not sure if this would be</text>
  <text start="126.819" dur="4.291">a stage it looks like it&amp;#39;s leading up to</text>
  <text start="128.739" dur="3.931">the ramp and up to the steps so it might</text>
  <text start="131.11" dur="3.15">be like some sort of performance area</text>
  <text start="132.67" dur="3.45">could be a stage or something like that</text>
  <text start="134.26" dur="3.36">looks like a place where people might</text>
  <text start="136.12" dur="3.839">meet for concerts or something like that</text>
  <text start="137.62" dur="4.229">who knows private parties and maybe they</text>
  <text start="139.959" dur="3.661">want to have some of the event outdoors</text>
  <text start="141.849" dur="3.39">or whatever not really sure and then</text>
  <text start="143.62" dur="3">you&amp;#39;ve got this little kiosk over here</text>
  <text start="145.239" dur="3.451">which is probably like a taco stand</text>
  <text start="146.62" dur="3.6">that&amp;#39;s where I do with it I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="148.69" dur="4.68">if that&amp;#39;s what they do with it but if I</text>
  <text start="150.22" dur="4.86">had an island and a patch of grass I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="153.37" dur="6.21">put a taco stand there that&amp;#39;s just me</text>
  <text start="155.08" dur="6.6">though let&amp;#39;s move on to 135 right yeah</text>
  <text start="159.58" dur="4.08">and we see what looks to be a sundial</text>
  <text start="161.68" dur="4.83">right here which probably does not</text>
  <text start="163.66" dur="4.53">suggest Sun worship at all and if you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="166.51" dur="4.44">notice you&amp;#39;ve got benches but not just</text>
  <text start="168.19" dur="6.06">benches multi-coloured and ethnically</text>
  <text start="170.95" dur="5.13">diverse benches outlying the perimeter</text>
  <text start="174.25" dur="4.23">of the sundial and you can see over here</text>
  <text start="176.08" dur="3.6">too this looks to be at first I thought</text>
  <text start="178.48" dur="3.24">it was a goat it looks like it might be</text>
  <text start="179.68" dur="2.97">a deer there but either way it startled</text>
  <text start="181.72" dur="4.109">it&amp;#39;s like what are you doing man I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="182.65" dur="4.38">trying to get my satanic worship on down</text>
  <text start="185.829" dur="3.151">here at 6 o&amp;#39;clock</text>
  <text start="187.03" dur="2.55">not really sure anyway this guy&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="188.98" dur="2.52">billions and</text>
  <text start="189.58" dur="3.99">can&amp;#39;t even afford a digital but you can</text>
  <text start="191.5" dur="3.36">see that the minutes are filled in up</text>
  <text start="193.57" dur="2.85">here at the top near midnight which</text>
  <text start="194.86" dur="3.69">probably suggests that right around who</text>
  <text start="196.42" dur="3.78">knows solstice time or whatever might</text>
  <text start="198.55" dur="3.27">have some sort of little special</text>
  <text start="200.2" dur="2.88">significance and they&amp;#39;re only considered</text>
  <text start="201.82" dur="1.71">they&amp;#39;re only really concerned with those</text>
  <text start="203.08" dur="2.25">minutes</text>
  <text start="203.53" dur="3.39">I don&amp;#39;t really know looks pretty creepy</text>
  <text start="205.33" dur="3.75">but let&amp;#39;s take another look at it here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="206.92" dur="4.08">an overhead view of the sundial and you</text>
  <text start="209.08" dur="3.72">can see around the head here it looks</text>
  <text start="211" dur="3.15">like they&amp;#39;ve got electric lights here</text>
  <text start="212.8" dur="2.76">now I suppose it could be cameras but</text>
  <text start="214.15" dur="4.29">they look like lights to me that way you</text>
  <text start="215.56" dur="4.5">can use your sundial at night but I have</text>
  <text start="218.44" dur="4.86">to say that if your sundial requires</text>
  <text start="220.06" dur="4.59">electricity you got a crappy sundial now</text>
  <text start="223.3" dur="4.14">you can see out and see all these other</text>
  <text start="224.65" dur="4.74">small islands off of this island and if</text>
  <text start="227.44" dur="5.19">I&amp;#39;m not mistaken this one right here is</text>
  <text start="229.39" dur="4.44">called dog island boom I wonder if</text>
  <text start="232.63" dur="4.02">that&amp;#39;s got anything to do with all those</text>
  <text start="233.83" dur="5.52">dog tweets but yeah dog island is just</text>
  <text start="236.65" dur="4.44">off of this island and you can see over</text>
  <text start="239.35" dur="3.87">here a bunch of bungalows and whatnot</text>
  <text start="241.09" dur="4.08">now we see the other side of the island</text>
  <text start="243.22" dur="3.51">and we start to get over towards the</text>
  <text start="245.17" dur="2.85">temple but over here on the right of</text>
  <text start="246.73" dur="2.82">your screen now I&amp;#39;m not really sure</text>
  <text start="248.02" dur="2.61">maybe you guys have more expertise can</text>
  <text start="249.55" dur="3.3">tell me it looks like this could be a</text>
  <text start="250.63" dur="4.889">generator here and I&amp;#39;m not so sure if</text>
  <text start="252.85" dur="4.47">this is some sort of maybe satellite</text>
  <text start="255.519" dur="3.631">type equipment or there could be just</text>
  <text start="257.32" dur="3.18">flood lights I can&amp;#39;t did the camera</text>
  <text start="259.15" dur="3.39">didn&amp;#39;t really get close enough for me to</text>
  <text start="260.5" dur="4.62">tell I wasn&amp;#39;t able to tell either way I</text>
  <text start="262.54" dur="3.87">suppose either one could make sense and</text>
  <text start="265.12" dur="3.12">then as we get closer we see this</text>
  <text start="266.41" dur="2.91">enclosed area right here which is weird</text>
  <text start="268.24" dur="2.76">that seems to be a whole bunch of</text>
  <text start="269.32" dur="3.06">patterns along the grass they almost</text>
  <text start="271" dur="3.3">look like crop circles but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="272.38" dur="3.15">definitely not crops but it looks like</text>
  <text start="274.3" dur="3.09">you could drive a vehicle in here</text>
  <text start="275.53" dur="3.84">obviously they made the road to be able</text>
  <text start="277.39" dur="3.69">to bring things in here so who knows</text>
  <text start="279.37" dur="3.9">maybe some little vehicles or screwing</text>
  <text start="281.08" dur="4.05">around in there who knows maybe they</text>
  <text start="283.27" dur="3.66">just play soccer in there and they built</text>
  <text start="285.13" dur="4.08">the berms up so that the ball would stop</text>
  <text start="286.93" dur="3.6">going into the ocean that&amp;#39;s annoying and</text>
  <text start="289.21" dur="2.67">there&amp;#39;s an overhead view of some of</text>
  <text start="290.53" dur="3.33">those tracks right there it looks like</text>
  <text start="291.88" dur="3.539">maybe they have some sort of who knows</text>
  <text start="293.86" dur="2.7">some sort of off-road vehicle maybe and</text>
  <text start="295.419" dur="3.781">they&amp;#39;re cruising around in that thing</text>
  <text start="296.56" dur="4.22">who knows what that&amp;#39;s actually about but</text>
  <text start="299.2" dur="3.93">it seems like they want it all enclosed</text>
  <text start="300.78" dur="3.82">but you can see right around here if you</text>
  <text start="303.13" dur="3.18">look up real close those look like tire</text>
  <text start="304.6" dur="3.39">tracks right there and these the goal</text>
  <text start="306.31" dur="3.359">ain&amp;#39;t like impressions and it looks like</text>
  <text start="307.99" dur="3.42">some sort of I don&amp;#39;t know some sort of</text>
  <text start="309.669" dur="3.451">vehicle cruising around and there who</text>
  <text start="311.41" dur="3.69">knows maybe they&amp;#39;re playing golf cart</text>
  <text start="313.12" dur="4.08">polo which sounds pretty dope actually</text>
  <text start="315.1" dur="4.05">now we see an overview of the temple</text>
  <text start="317.2" dur="4.11">here no longer with the golden dome</text>
  <text start="319.15" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s long since been removed</text>
  <text start="321.31" dur="3.72">interesting that they&amp;#39;ve got this area</text>
  <text start="323.02" dur="3.63">cut out around here this could be some</text>
  <text start="325.03" dur="3.81">sort of irrigation thing I&amp;#39;m not really</text>
  <text start="326.65" dur="3.84">sure but it also looks like it could</text>
  <text start="328.84" dur="3.63">suggest something structural like there</text>
  <text start="330.49" dur="4.2">might be a structure down below if you</text>
  <text start="332.47" dur="3.87">can kind of really sure but I find it</text>
  <text start="334.69" dur="3.33">very interesting that they&amp;#39;ve gotta cut</text>
  <text start="336.34" dur="3.57">around here and they&amp;#39;ve got it blocked</text>
  <text start="338.02" dur="4.65">off by ropes obviously so you don&amp;#39;t fall</text>
  <text start="339.91" dur="4.65">in but who knows it does kind of look</text>
  <text start="342.67" dur="3.33">obviously it&amp;#39;s perfectly cut it could be</text>
  <text start="344.56" dur="3.3">some sort of irrigation thing I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="346" dur="4.11">really know but it looks like there</text>
  <text start="347.86" dur="3.96">might also be something down below then</text>
  <text start="350.11" dur="3.06">we get an overhead view here which this</text>
  <text start="351.82" dur="4.34">camera actually spent a bit of time on</text>
  <text start="353.17" dur="7.2">and lookie there what&amp;#39;s that John John</text>
  <text start="356.16" dur="6.4">nice how can you tell yeah it does it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="360.37" dur="5.31">gotta see it&amp;#39;s got a little circle and</text>
  <text start="362.56" dur="4.95">then it&amp;#39;s got a little see it nice now</text>
  <text start="365.68" dur="3.63">we see a close-up of this little area</text>
  <text start="367.51" dur="3.03">here as you can see this is a window</text>
  <text start="369.31" dur="3.78">here it looks like the door is on the</text>
  <text start="370.54" dur="5.07">other side but you can see in the window</text>
  <text start="373.09" dur="4.14">and from what I can tell these look to</text>
  <text start="375.61" dur="4.83">be a bunch of cans whether they&amp;#39;re paint</text>
  <text start="377.23" dur="4.74">cans or who know cement or who knows</text>
  <text start="380.44" dur="3.09">what it is some sort of materials and</text>
  <text start="381.97" dur="4.14">there also seems to be a little bit of</text>
  <text start="383.53" dur="5.25">scaffolding there and a ladder now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="386.11" dur="4.35">seen a little bit lower here and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="388.78" dur="3.6">the ladder right there in the window and</text>
  <text start="390.46" dur="4.08">I can&amp;#39;t really tell what that is beyond</text>
  <text start="392.38" dur="4.05">that at first it looks like a little bit</text>
  <text start="394.54" dur="3.9">of bedding there but it also looks like</text>
  <text start="396.43" dur="4.5">it could be bags whether it&amp;#39;s bags of</text>
  <text start="398.44" dur="4.02">pre-mixed cement I&amp;#39;m not really sure</text>
  <text start="400.93" dur="3.3">maybe they&amp;#39;re stacked on top of each</text>
  <text start="402.46" dur="5.37">other but then if we just look a couple</text>
  <text start="404.23" dur="4.8">seconds ahead there we see another angle</text>
  <text start="407.83" dur="2.64">right there there&amp;#39;s the ladder there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="409.03" dur="3.45">the scaffolding and now it looks a</text>
  <text start="410.47" dur="3.9">little bit more like it could be a bed</text>
  <text start="412.48" dur="5.1">I&amp;#39;m not really sure that also seems to</text>
  <text start="414.37" dur="5.97">be a window but whatever it is it looks</text>
  <text start="417.58" dur="4.56">like this part is a wall and I still</text>
  <text start="420.34" dur="4.02">feel that this could very well be some</text>
  <text start="422.14" dur="4.32">sort of elevator shaft it may just be</text>
  <text start="424.36" dur="3.48">some sort of weird little bedroom who</text>
  <text start="426.46" dur="3.54">knows maybe they just do the little</text>
  <text start="427.84" dur="4.41">satanic e stuff here they save all the</text>
  <text start="430" dur="4.2">big productions for someplace else but</text>
  <text start="432.25" dur="4.41">they just do the little micro satanic</text>
  <text start="434.2" dur="5.73">stuff here not sure but here you can see</text>
  <text start="436.66" dur="5.16">the entrance and this actually looks</text>
  <text start="439.93" dur="3.54">like an entrance to an elevator although</text>
  <text start="441.82" dur="3.54">looking inside it doesn&amp;#39;t take you</text>
  <text start="443.47" dur="3.48">directly into any kind of elevator but</text>
  <text start="445.36" dur="3.27">it sure does look like the entrance to</text>
  <text start="446.95" dur="3.45">an elevator there and it looks like</text>
  <text start="448.63" dur="4.05">whether there was an electric switch</text>
  <text start="450.4" dur="4.09">there or who knows what that is right</text>
  <text start="452.68" dur="4.09">there but either way it takes you into</text>
  <text start="454.49" dur="4.739">something creepy so there you go thanks</text>
  <text start="456.77" dur="5.13">to rusty Shackelford if that is your</text>

  <text start="1076.71" dur="4.74">in the world like I told you yesterday</text>
  <text start="1078.18" dur="5.61">it was founded in 1874 but it used to be</text>
  <text start="1081.45" dur="4.41">called the Jerry society and the Jerry</text>
  <text start="1083.79" dur="4.62">Jerry Society was named after this guy</text>
  <text start="1085.86" dur="4.35">right here Elbridge Thomas Jerry who was</text>
  <text start="1088.41" dur="4.47">the grandson of US vice president</text>
  <text start="1090.21" dur="5.34">Elbridge Gerry and he was also known as</text>

  <text start="1098.52" dur="3.33">that</text>
  <text start="1099.54" dur="4.26">now this societies been around for a</text>
  <text start="1101.85" dur="4.77">very very long time I want to point out</text>
  <text start="1103.8" dur="6.09">just about him that he was entombed in</text>
  <text start="1106.62" dur="5.85">the churchyard of st. James Church in</text>
  <text start="1109.89" dur="4.17">Hyde Park New York in Hyde Park New York</text>
  <text start="1112.47" dur="3.57">is</text>
  <text start="1114.06" dur="3.93">I&amp;#39;ve got a lot of activists living there</text>
  <text start="1116.04" dur="4.35">let&amp;#39;s just say that there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="1117.99" dur="4.14">people living in Hyde Park so very</text>
  <text start="1120.39" dur="4.02">interesting stuff but let&amp;#39;s go back to</text>
  <text start="1122.13" dur="4.29">this Giri Society and I know via the</text>
  <text start="1124.41" dur="3.93">print is really really small here it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1126.42" dur="3.96">so hard on Wikipedia to show you this</text>
  <text start="1128.34" dur="4.77">but I want to point this thing out</text>
  <text start="1130.38" dur="4.47">because this was really suspect in the</text>
  <text start="1133.11" dur="4.17">late nineteen eighteen seventy excuse me</text>
  <text start="1134.85" dur="5.4">Gerry persuaded the police department to</text>
  <text start="1137.28" dur="6">allow Society agents nicknamed Gerry men</text>
  <text start="1140.25" dur="5.1">to keep Jill children away from immoral</text>
  <text start="1143.28" dur="4.47">activities such as the theater amusement</text>
  <text start="1145.35" dur="4.8">parks Penny arcade&amp;#39;s and pour an</text>
  <text start="1147.75" dur="4.35">immigrant neighborhoods Gerry was keen</text>
  <text start="1150.15" dur="4.02">to enforce child labor laws regarding</text>
  <text start="1152.1" dur="3.75">performance moving beyond street theatre</text>
  <text start="1154.17" dur="4.47">and acrobatics he turned to juvenile</text>
  <text start="1155.85" dur="4.8">theatre which caused controversy with</text>
  <text start="1158.64" dur="4.17">those involved in the theater anti GRE</text>
  <text start="1160.65" dur="4.08">campaign groups formed and the mayor of</text>
  <text start="1162.81" dur="3.9">New York was persuaded to limit Gerry&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1164.73" dur="5.64">power and set out proper regulation of</text>
  <text start="1166.71" dur="5.28">child stage performers so it looks like</text>
  <text start="1170.37" dur="3.63">it goes all the way back to this Jerri</text>
  <text start="1171.99" dur="3.99">Society and it sounds to me like these</text>
  <text start="1174" dur="3.45">Gerry men were going to all these places</text>
  <text start="1175.98" dur="3.15">like the theatre and amusement parks and</text>
  <text start="1177.45" dur="4.5">Penny arcade&amp;#39;s you know places where</text>
  <text start="1179.13" dur="4.56">kids go to keep them away from immoral</text>
  <text start="1181.95" dur="3.6">activities and make sure that they put</text>
  <text start="1183.69" dur="3.81">them in a little traveling theater which</text>
  <text start="1185.55" dur="4.14">probably later came became a whole bunch</text>
  <text start="1187.5" dur="4.2">of other stuff which later became what</text>
  <text start="1189.69" dur="4.08">we know now to be this massive</text>
  <text start="1191.7" dur="3.68">human trafficking issue now I&amp;#39;m not sure</text>
  <text start="1193.77" dur="4.29">but I got to tell you that sounds</text>
  <text start="1195.38" dur="4.09">extremely suspect I also want to point</text>
  <text start="1198.06" dur="2.76">out that one of the other founders of</text>
  <text start="1199.47" dur="3.51">the New York Society for the Prevention</text>

  <text start="1206.28" dur="3.81">was real instrumental in kind of getting</text>
  <text start="1208.44" dur="4.02">this group wrapped up with the legal</text>

  <text start="1216.23" dur="4.51">lots more arrests were coming out and</text>
  <text start="1218.88" dur="3.66">they were attributing it to the society</text>
  <text start="1220.74" dur="3.54">but the arrests were all crime sexual</text>
  <text start="1222.54" dur="4.14">crimes against children I find that very</text>
  <text start="1224.28" dur="4.8">very odd outwardly it seems like okay</text>
  <text start="1226.68" dur="3.96">these guys were the ones who were kind</text>
  <text start="1229.08" dur="3.96">of instrumental in creating all these</text>
  <text start="1230.64" dur="5.31">arrests but it seems very very suspect</text>
  <text start="1233.04" dur="6.33">this guy Berg also at the time in the</text>
  <text start="1235.95" dur="6.15">late 1870s was also lobbying to flog</text>

  <text start="1245.01" dur="2.67">that sounds really really suspect and</text>
  <text start="1246.69" dur="3.69">for such an old</text>

  <text start="1558.36" dur="3.63">we might be talking about him I want to</text>
  <text start="1560.61" dur="3.36">do a little bit more digging on him</text>

  <text start="2106.54" dur="4.47">that kind of I phone in the vicinity</text>
  <text start="2109.03" dur="3.48">will get pinged with this and then you</text>
  <text start="2111.01" dur="3.24">choose to whether or not you want to</text>
  <text start="2112.51" dur="4.38">accept and look at the pic that&amp;#39;s how I</text>
  <text start="2114.25" dur="5.51">understand it but this is really really</text>
  <text start="2116.89" dur="4.92">strange now this can also happen on a</text>
  <text start="2119.76" dur="3.43">Android phone too they have something</text>
  <text start="2121.81" dur="2.82">like it I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s called air</text>
  <text start="2123.19" dur="4.32">dropping but they do have something</text>
  <text start="2124.63" dur="5.13">that&amp;#39;s like this but I find it very</text>
  <text start="2127.51" dur="5.37">curious that this was high phones Apple</text>
  <text start="2129.76" dur="5.94">phones because I talked at you last year</text>
  <text start="2132.88" dur="5.76">about JetBlue this is when Q was talking</text>
  <text start="2135.7" dur="4.169">about JetBlue planes on the q post we</text>
  <text start="2138.64" dur="3.78">were talking about this thing called</text>
  <text start="2139.869" dur="4.891">Apple pay JetBlue had made a deal with</text>
  <text start="2142.42" dur="3.63">Apple to start accepting Apple pay where</text>
  <text start="2144.76" dur="2.79">you can pay with your iPhone so they</text>
  <text start="2146.05" dur="3.42">already had a kind of connection and</text>
  <text start="2147.55" dur="3.93">that was the first connection that I had</text>
  <text start="2149.47" dur="4.649">noticed and of course the reason why I</text>
  <text start="2151.48" dur="3.96">thought that was funky was because you</text>
  <text start="2154.119" dur="4.321">know many of us have talked about this</text>
  <text start="2155.44" dur="5.13">on interrupts able auto pilot and the</text>
  <text start="2158.44" dur="4.71">MCAS system things like that these</text>
  <text start="2160.57" dur="4.44">things can be controlled you know</text>
  <text start="2163.15" dur="3.48">possibly through something like that now</text>
  <text start="2165.01" dur="3.599">I&amp;#39;m not saying that&amp;#39;s what it is I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2166.63" dur="3.87">just saying that those are things that</text>
  <text start="2168.609" dur="4.441">are possible and the reason why we think</text>
  <text start="2170.5" dur="5.85">about this at all is because JetBlue has</text>
  <text start="2173.05" dur="5.13">also been implicated in delivering some</text>
  <text start="2176.35" dur="3.29">pizza if you know what I mean they made</text>
  <text start="2178.18" dur="3.23">a deal with a certain piece</text>
  <text start="2179.64" dur="3.54">conglomerate that they were gonna send</text>
  <text start="2181.41" dur="3.75">pizza around the world and I think we</text>
  <text start="2183.18" dur="5.46">all know what that implies at this point</text>
  <text start="2185.16" dur="5.94">if you do not I highly suggest you look</text>
  <text start="2188.64" dur="4.8">into pizza gay and you&amp;#39;ll know exactly</text>
  <text start="2191.1" dur="4.56">what we&amp;#39;re talking about you seems to</text>
  <text start="2193.44" dur="4.92">sort of confirm this q was also</text>
  <text start="2195.66" dur="4.74">confirming that this JetBlue I had a</text>
  <text start="2198.36" dur="4.38">relation with a big tech which leads me</text>
  <text start="2200.4" dur="4.23">to think that we are talking about Apple</text>
