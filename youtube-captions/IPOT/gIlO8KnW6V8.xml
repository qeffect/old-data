  <text start="45.33" dur="4.71">little bit about YouTube this platform</text>
  <text start="47.4" dur="6.56">this channel and what that means for you</text>
  <text start="50.04" dur="3.92">and me so let&amp;#39;s get started</text>
  <text start="57.399" dur="4.721">alright first things first we&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="59.3" dur="4.709">mashable.com YouTube says it can delete</text>
  <text start="62.12" dur="4.59">your account if you&amp;#39;re not commercially</text>
  <text start="64.009" dur="4.171">viable we&amp;#39;re not going to go away in</text>
  <text start="66.71" dur="3.449">depth in this article here I just want</text>
  <text start="68.18" dur="4.229">to point out that on December 10th there</text>
  <text start="70.159" dur="4.5">knew whatever their new terms are gonna</text>
  <text start="72.409" dur="4.89">begin YouTube may terminate your access</text>
  <text start="74.659" dur="4.561">or your Google accounts access to all or</text>
  <text start="77.299" dur="4.051">part of the service if YouTube believes</text>
  <text start="79.22" dur="3.84">in its sole discretion that provision of</text>
  <text start="81.35" dur="3.329">the service to you is no longer</text>
  <text start="83.06" dur="2.91">commercially viable</text>
  <text start="84.679" dur="3.151">all right well long story short that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="85.97" dur="2.969">me then that might be you and it might</text>
  <text start="87.83" dur="3.06">be some of your favorite content</text>
  <text start="88.939" dur="3.451">creators what this is is YouTube</text>
  <text start="90.89" dur="3.869">basically giving us the warning that</text>
  <text start="92.39" dur="4.5">they are ready to give us the boot now</text>
  <text start="94.759" dur="3.691">they may they may not but the fact of</text>
  <text start="96.89" dur="3.899">the matter is that we need to be</text>
  <text start="98.45" dur="3.9">prepared for this to happen now I get a</text>
  <text start="100.789" dur="5.01">lot of people saying Patrick why don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="102.35" dur="6.12">you just leave YouTube and go to you</text>
  <text start="105.799" dur="4.981">know X platform well that&amp;#39;s a great idea</text>
  <text start="108.47" dur="4.47">but I want to point out that on YouTube</text>
  <text start="110.78" dur="3.509">I have a 150,000 subscribers and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="112.94" dur="4.59">over here on my bitch chute now where I</text>
  <text start="114.289" dur="4.231">have four and I&amp;#39;m thankful for all you</text>
  <text start="117.53" dur="2.58">four as a matter of fact they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="118.52" dur="4.23">probably about a thousand of you just</text>
  <text start="120.11" dur="4.14">join this weekend and thank you so much</text>
  <text start="122.75" dur="3.989">but the fact of the matter is that we</text>
  <text start="124.25" dur="3.929">can&amp;#39;t really my gray without you it</text>
  <text start="126.739" dur="3.24">doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense for me to drop a</text>
  <text start="128.179" dur="3.601">platform where I&amp;#39;ve still got 150</text>
  <text start="129.979" dur="4.801">thousand subscribers to go to a platform</text>
  <text start="131.78" dur="5.25">where I&amp;#39;ve got four I think that makes</text>
  <text start="134.78" dur="4.679">sense just bad math but we&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="137.03" dur="3.569">going to have to at some point now</text>
  <text start="139.459" dur="3.241">ladies and gentlemen I don&amp;#39;t have all</text>
  <text start="140.599" dur="3.991">the answers to this as far as bitch</text>
  <text start="142.7" dur="5.039">chute goes it&amp;#39;s been the most reliable</text>
  <text start="144.59" dur="5.22">outside of YouTube as far as putting up</text>
  <text start="147.739" dur="3.811">my videos and whatnot there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="149.81" dur="4.679">different platforms now it can be used</text>
  <text start="151.55" dur="5.909">I&amp;#39;m over here on gab to where I also</text>
  <text start="154.489" dur="4.431">have about 1.3 followers so you can see</text>
  <text start="157.459" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;s just not as substantial as</text>
  <text start="158.92" dur="4.239">something like YouTube and Twitter right</text>
  <text start="161.239" dur="3.78">now but the fact of the matter is is</text>
  <text start="163.159" dur="3.69">that they&amp;#39;re looking for a way to push</text>
  <text start="165.019" dur="5.161">us out and we&amp;#39;re gonna need to probably</text>
  <text start="166.849" dur="4.681">find a way to migrate so my links are</text>
  <text start="170.18" dur="4.05">down below in the video description</text>
  <text start="171.53" dur="5.61">right below the video you can choose the</text>
  <text start="174.23" dur="5.64">one that you like personally if I do get</text>
  <text start="177.14" dur="3.929">to boot I will continue to post on bitch</text>
  <text start="179.87" dur="3.63">you because they&amp;#39;ve never given me the</text>
  <text start="181.069" dur="5.071">boot now they have given me problems</text>
  <text start="183.5" dur="4.11">uploading it seems to be more of you</text>
  <text start="186.14" dur="3.929">know technical issue or whatnot so</text>
  <text start="187.61" dur="3">sometimes I can upload but overall they</text>
  <text start="190.069" dur="3.211">have an</text>
  <text start="190.61" dur="3.81">actually taking anything down and as you</text>
  <text start="193.28" dur="3.06">can see right there there&amp;#39;s my latest</text>
  <text start="194.42" dur="3.24">video the Weathermen - which just came</text>

  <text start="199.94" dur="3.48">but for those of you who are gonna be</text>
  <text start="202.19" dur="3.12">wondering what&amp;#39;s gonna go on with</text>
  <text start="203.42" dur="4.05">YouTube if you find me missing or if you</text>
  <text start="205.31" dur="4.2">find your favorite content creator</text>
  <text start="207.47" dur="3.69">missing that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="209.51" dur="3.42">trying to warn you and we&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="211.16" dur="3.57">get you guys to migrate but we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="212.93" dur="3.27">really do that without you we really</text>
  <text start="214.73" dur="3.54">need your help so I would love to</text>
  <text start="216.2" dur="4.08">implore that you either join me over</text>

  <text start="223.04" dur="3.3">can make this transition a little bit</text>
  <text start="224.42" dur="3.75">smoother for us because this could</text>
  <text start="226.34" dur="4.08">happen any day and I want to point out</text>
  <text start="228.17" dur="4.46">that just yesterday YouTube took my</text>
  <text start="230.42" dur="4.65">channel down for about an hour and</text>
  <text start="232.63" dur="5.2">removed all my videos and then put them</text>
  <text start="235.07" dur="5.37">back now my whistleblower videos were</text>
  <text start="237.83" dur="4.32">removed and I&amp;#39;m already in talks with</text>
  <text start="240.44" dur="3.33">them over that they&amp;#39;re not budging on</text>
  <text start="242.15" dur="3.15">that but that&amp;#39;s a different story</text>
  <text start="243.77" dur="3.57">but the fact of the matter is is that</text>
  <text start="245.3" dur="5.55">yes they can drop it and you wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="247.34" dur="5.52">able to even email me so we need to make</text>
  <text start="250.85" dur="3.389">these moves I&amp;#39;m trying to join some</text>
  <text start="252.86" dur="3.629">other platforms and set up some other</text>
  <text start="254.239" dur="4.231">accounts and I think I will probably be</text>

  <text start="1760.8" dur="4.05">to talk about is this project deep dream</text>
  <text start="1763.14" dur="5.4">now I made a video about this On</text>
  <text start="1764.85" dur="6.6">February 24th 2018 entitled two minutes</text>
  <text start="1768.54" dur="6.51">of truth episode three deep dream it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1771.45" dur="4.95">only 1 minute and 48 seconds long but we</text>
  <text start="1775.05" dur="3.39">talk about this program</text>
  <text start="1776.4" dur="4.83">deep dream now this thing is very very</text>
  <text start="1778.44" dur="5.43">odd this thing basically takes pictures</text>
  <text start="1781.23" dur="3.48">and it turns it into other pictures they</text>
  <text start="1783.87" dur="4.47">call it peridot</text>
  <text start="1784.71" dur="6.719">yeah and this is actually used as a</text>
  <text start="1788.34" dur="5.309">surveillance program I highly suggest</text>
  <text start="1791.429" dur="4.921">you check the video out because it</text>
  <text start="1793.649" dur="4.681">explains it in more detail but I have it</text>
  <text start="1796.35" dur="3.209">drawn up on this right here funded by</text>
  <text start="1798.33" dur="3.27">Dewey in the startup stage</text>
  <text start="1799.559" dur="4.411">Dewey intends to use deep dream for</text>

  <text start="1808.679" dur="4.831">program known as Iron Hands so</text>
  <text start="1811.74" dur="3.48">essentially what this is doing and of</text>
  <text start="1813.51" dur="5.01">course I&amp;#39;m oversimplifying here but this</text>
  <text start="1815.22" dur="5.189">is using AI to recognize faces right</text>
  <text start="1818.52" dur="3.75">from your own computer screen doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1820.409" dur="3.63">even need to be through your camera it</text>
  <text start="1822.27" dur="3.72">can recognize things but deep dream was</text>
  <text start="1824.039" dur="4.411">even gonna go even further than that and</text>
  <text start="1825.99" dur="4.71">actually try to spy on you while you</text>
  <text start="1828.45" dur="4.41">dream and they were actually dreaming up</text>
  <text start="1830.7" dur="4.5">AI programs to actually try to see if it</text>
  <text start="1832.86" dur="4.919">can read your dreams and essentially go</text>
  <text start="1835.2" dur="4.709">into all this sort of predictive crime</text>
  <text start="1837.779" dur="3.661">kind of thing right sort of like a lot</text>
  <text start="1839.909" dur="3.87">of these movies that we&amp;#39;ve seen like</text>
  <text start="1841.44" dur="5.13">Inception or Jason Bourne which is</text>
  <text start="1843.779" dur="4.88">basically what this was based off of but</text>
  <text start="1846.57" dur="5.04">you see what&amp;#39;s going on here this is AI</text>
  <text start="1848.659" dur="6.061">reading faces reading your minds reading</text>
  <text start="1851.61" dur="6.059">your voices reading everything about you</text>
  <text start="1854.72" dur="5.23">essentially life law which later of</text>
  <text start="1857.669" dur="5.041">course became Facebook and if this is</text>
  <text start="1859.95" dur="4.589">confusing all of you it is very very</text>
  <text start="1862.71" dur="4.14">very confusing there&amp;#39;s a lot of programs</text>
  <text start="1864.539" dur="4.921">here involved but this deep mind of this</text>
  <text start="1866.85" dur="5.52">deep dream all this stuff is using AI</text>
  <text start="1869.46" dur="4.829">and facial recognition software and</text>
  <text start="1872.37" dur="4.02">really so much more beyond than that</text>
  <text start="1874.289" dur="4.051">trying to essentially even read your</text>
  <text start="1876.39" dur="4.95">thoughts and maybe even predict your</text>
  <text start="1878.34" dur="5.219">behavior and possibly arrest you because</text>
  <text start="1881.34" dur="4.35">of it so all this was getting set up it</text>
  <text start="1883.559" dur="3.781">looked like Edward Snowden was helping a</text>
  <text start="1885.69" dur="3.33">lot of these tech agencies doing that</text>
  <text start="1887.34" dur="4.199">and then of course when they got on the</text>
  <text start="1889.02" dur="4.35">air Edward Snowden Edward Snowden</text>
  <text start="1891.539" dur="4.02">basically released this information that</text>
  <text start="1893.37" dur="4.23">the NSA was spying on us making him look</text>

  <text start="1997.289" dur="4.741">talking about this for a long time and</text>
  <text start="1999.09" dur="5.339">we have a history of seeing that this</text>

  <text start="2035.179" dur="4.351">that she never went anywhere at all she</text>
  <text start="2037.37" dur="4.11">was just in this contraption and it</text>
  <text start="2039.53" dur="3.75">seems to be kind of laid out kind of</text>
  <text start="2041.48" dur="4.14">like how they describe this project</text>
