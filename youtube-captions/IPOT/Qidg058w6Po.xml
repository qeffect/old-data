  <text start="429.01" dur="3.87">and people were paying for it like</text>
  <text start="430.24" dur="4.59">George Soros and the American ambassador</text>

  <text start="514.9" dur="3.84">investigate Biden and of course this is</text>
  <text start="516.7" dur="4.11">a very same thing that Biden did in</text>

  <text start="660.55" dur="8.28">and it will be more resilient because</text>
  <text start="665.95" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;ll have less points of failure like</text>

  <text start="720.4" dur="4.41">talking about this event in which all</text>
  <text start="723.28" dur="3.99">these people were found with these</text>
  <text start="724.81" dur="4.41">orange wristbands and some of them had</text>
  <text start="727.27" dur="3.12">died some of them were really sickened</text>
  <text start="729.22" dur="2.19">in the hospital it&amp;#39;s about four of them</text>
  <text start="730.39" dur="3.42">in the hospital</text>

  <text start="733.81" dur="2.58">if there was any more but that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="734.86" dur="3.87">they found five of them more found in</text>
  <text start="736.39" dur="3.81">this apartment and I&amp;#39;ve got to kind of</text>
  <text start="738.73" dur="3.39">zoomed out here a little bit because I</text>
  <text start="740.2" dur="3.9">want to give you an idea the whole area</text>
  <text start="742.12" dur="3.66">but if you can see kind of Center right</text>
  <text start="744.1" dur="4.14">where my mouse is here right around</text>
  <text start="745.78" dur="3.99">where this Southside works his was where</text>
  <text start="748.24" dur="3.3">the apartment is and I showed you this</text>
  <text start="749.77" dur="4.11">little complex over here to where they</text>
  <text start="751.54" dur="3.93">were doing some stem-cell research</text>
  <text start="753.88" dur="2.85">things like that place called a mean</text>
  <text start="755.47" dur="3.45">attics now I want to point out I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="756.73" dur="3.42">casting any aspersions there I just</text>
  <text start="758.92" dur="3.45">wanted to point out there that there was</text>
  <text start="760.15" dur="4.41">some stem cell work being done nearby</text>
  <text start="762.37" dur="3.87">but whatever it was caused a little bit</text>
  <text start="764.56" dur="3.12">of a health scare they weren&amp;#39;t sure if</text>
  <text start="766.24" dur="3.3">this was some sort of fentanyl related</text>
  <text start="767.68" dur="3.78">kind of thing we haven&amp;#39;t really heard a</text>
  <text start="769.54" dur="3.81">big update but people were found dead</text>
  <text start="771.46" dur="3.03">and there was a little bit of a health</text>
  <text start="773.35" dur="3.48">scare for a while and then they kind of</text>
  <text start="774.49" dur="5.22">dropped off now I also pointed out that</text>
  <text start="776.83" dur="5.4">if you look over here up top here in top</text>
  <text start="779.71" dur="4.65">left of your screen the David L Lawrence</text>
  <text start="782.23" dur="5.01">Convention Center they were incidentally</text>
  <text start="784.36" dur="5.04">having a basically an active crisis</text>
  <text start="787.24" dur="5.25">drill going on and this was being</text>
  <text start="789.4" dur="5.28">announced by this public safety officer</text>
  <text start="792.49" dur="3.69">and his name is Wendell hiss Rick and I</text>
  <text start="794.68" dur="3.9">pointed out that he&amp;#39;s not just a public</text>
  <text start="796.18" dur="5.07">safety officer but he is also a chief of</text>
  <text start="798.58" dur="4.71">police and he was the one that was the</text>
  <text start="801.25" dur="4.23">spokesman both for this act of crisis</text>
  <text start="803.29" dur="4.02">drill but also the spokesman for this</text>
  <text start="805.48" dur="3.69">incident with the orange bands and I</text>
  <text start="807.31" dur="3.09">found that very interesting so they were</text>
  <text start="809.17" dur="2.82">announcing these drills I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="810.4" dur="4.05">exactly what happened with these drills</text>
  <text start="811.99" dur="4.11">or what was really going on but I also</text>
  <text start="814.45" dur="3.48">want to point out here and you can see</text>
  <text start="816.1" dur="3.54">this little ad here thanks to an Don&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="817.93" dur="4.26">lot of you guys are kind of gone on this</text>
  <text start="819.64" dur="4.05">story but it looks to me like they got a</text>
  <text start="822.19" dur="3.24">little convention going on over here at</text>
  <text start="823.69" dur="3.93">the David L Lawrence Convention Center</text>
  <text start="825.43" dur="4.53">along with this active drill and oddly</text>
  <text start="827.62" dur="5.73">enough it has to do with</text>
  <text start="829.96" dur="6.09">umu net ryx and histocompatibility how</text>
  <text start="833.35" dur="4.65">about that so maybe I wasn&amp;#39;t so far off</text>
  <text start="836.05" dur="3.39">but I also want to point out I got a few</text>
  <text start="838" dur="4.89">tips from some of you too that they were</text>
  <text start="839.44" dur="5.16">a there was a nearby possible evacuation</text>
  <text start="842.89" dur="4.05">general which should be happening today</text>
  <text start="844.6" dur="3.84">in the nearby US Steel building which is</text>
  <text start="846.94" dur="3.09">right here and I asked some of you guys</text>
  <text start="848.44" dur="4.29">to take pictures of that area if you</text>
  <text start="850.03" dur="3.9">could now hopefully everything is okay</text>
  <text start="852.73" dur="3.27">over there I want to point out that the</text>
  <text start="853.93" dur="4.08">Heinz Center is over here too so this</text>
  <text start="856" dur="3.66">was a really really curious neighborhood</text>
  <text start="858.01" dur="4.14">and if you watched my last video it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="859.66" dur="4.47">entitled orange and bad it&amp;#39;s from a</text>
  <text start="862.15" dur="3.87">couple days ago I pointed out that</text>
  <text start="864.13" dur="3.15">there&amp;#39;s two FedEx centers around here</text>
  <text start="866.02" dur="2.7">I&amp;#39;m not gonna zoom in and I&amp;#39;m here</text>
  <text start="867.28" dur="2.76">because I&amp;#39;m having some slow internet</text>
  <text start="868.72" dur="3.3">but there was also a Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="870.04" dur="4.26">and so I was noting that the Planned</text>
  <text start="872.02" dur="3.96">Parenthood the FedEx centers and of</text>
  <text start="874.3" dur="4.11">course the stem-cell research in the</text>
  <text start="875.98" dur="3.84">nearby areas here I found to be curious</text>
  <text start="878.41" dur="3.27">and again I&amp;#39;m not making any accusations</text>
  <text start="879.82" dur="2.52">but I just wanted to point out that it</text>
  <text start="881.68" dur="3.03">was curious</text>
  <text start="882.34" dur="4.95">it was also curious that this public</text>
  <text start="884.71" dur="4.38">safety officer his urk who also happens</text>
  <text start="887.29" dur="3.42">to be you know it doesn&amp;#39;t surprise me</text>
  <text start="889.09" dur="2.79">that he wears a couple titles but I</text>
  <text start="890.71" dur="3.03">found it interesting that he was a</text>
  <text start="891.88" dur="3.78">spokesman for both of these events and</text>
  <text start="893.74" dur="4.62">then we get word of this possible</text>
  <text start="895.66" dur="5.01">possible evacuation right in the same</text>
  <text start="898.36" dur="3.48">near neighborhood here at US Steel now I</text>
  <text start="900.67" dur="3.42">don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s going down if</text>
  <text start="901.84" dur="4.44">that&amp;#39;s gonna go on down today or not I</text>
  <text start="904.09" dur="4.05">hope it you know everybody stay safe if</text>
  <text start="906.28" dur="4.68">you&amp;#39;re in this area but keep your eyes</text>
  <text start="908.14" dur="5.19">open but I also want to point out as we</text>
  <text start="910.96" dur="4.83">zoom out here kind of in this area just</text>
  <text start="913.33" dur="5.73">north we had a lot of activity and</text>
  <text start="915.79" dur="4.8">thanks to military spec ops monkey he</text>
  <text start="919.06" dur="3.3">turned me on to a few different aircraft</text>
  <text start="920.59" dur="3">in the area kind of top of your screen</text>
  <text start="922.36" dur="2.91">there I&amp;#39;m kind of giving you a rough</text>
  <text start="923.59" dur="3.51">estimate but as you can see these are</text>
  <text start="925.27" dur="3.36">all Air Force craft right there and look</text>
  <text start="927.1" dur="3.24">at some of these flight patterns I mean</text>
  <text start="928.63" dur="2.52">who even does this know maybe this is</text>
  <text start="930.34" dur="2.7">completely normal</text>
  <text start="931.15" dur="5.79">who knows but this was all going on at</text>
  <text start="933.04" dur="5.15">the same time so maybe we are you know</text>
  <text start="936.94" dur="3.27">who knows maybe this is just some random</text>
  <text start="938.19" dur="3.64">military exercise and I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="940.21" dur="4.23">fine but I find it very interesting that</text>
  <text start="941.83" dur="3.84">you had some people dead nearby right at</text>
  <text start="944.44" dur="3.9">the same time all these different events</text>
  <text start="945.67" dur="4.5">were going on and oddly enough of course</text>
  <text start="948.34" dur="3.21">my nose just sniffed out the stem cell</text>
  <text start="950.17" dur="2.94">stuff and the Planned Parenthood stuff</text>
  <text start="951.55" dur="3.54">because I&amp;#39;ve been researching that for</text>
  <text start="953.11" dur="4.74">other stories but I found it very unique</text>
  <text start="955.09" dur="5.7">that in the same building as this active</text>
