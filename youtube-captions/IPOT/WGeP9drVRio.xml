  <text start="372.9" dur="6.63">logically first private now I think he</text>
  <text start="377.13" dur="5.94">was talking about the original meeting</text>
  <text start="379.53" dur="5.34">was originally done back in November and</text>
  <text start="383.07" dur="3.96">if we even go back we don&amp;#39;t have to go</text>
  <text start="384.87" dur="5.729">back far back some of Q&amp;#39;s most recent</text>
  <text start="387.03" dur="5.669">posts remember Q did a a proof pic of</text>
  <text start="390.599" dur="3.301">the sky and we had assumed at the time</text>
  <text start="392.699" dur="2.34">that that could have been in Korea and</text>
  <text start="393.9" dur="2.579">that was back in November when we</text>
  <text start="395.039" dur="3.451">thought the deal might have originally</text>
  <text start="396.479" dur="4.951">been done so who knows what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="398.49" dur="4.32">worked on since then and then Q says</text>
  <text start="401.43" dur="2.82">second public and I&amp;#39;m assuming that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="402.81" dur="3.42">the meeting we&amp;#39;re going to see tomorrow</text>
  <text start="404.25" dur="4.47">now as far as this class</text>
  <text start="406.23" dur="5.55">vacation five and six I&amp;#39;m gonna bring</text>
  <text start="408.72" dur="5.07">this up in a future post here coming up</text>
  <text start="411.78" dur="4.92">but I have a feeling that we&amp;#39;ve got five</text>

  <text start="416.7" dur="5.61">thing that could be coming to light</text>
  <text start="419.55" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;ll see but black water is on guard</text>
  <text start="422.31" dur="4.68">and of course most of us kind of equate</text>

  <text start="432.99" dur="5.88">be involved and this might involve I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="436.53" dur="4.35">assuming black water is not likely</text>
  <text start="438.87" dur="3.69">guarding the president but I would not</text>
  <text start="440.88" dur="4.53">be surprised if black water was guarding</text>
  <text start="442.56" dur="5.22">kim jeong-hoon could be guarding Julian</text>

  <text start="807.73" dur="5.07">about injecting evidence okay and I</text>
  <text start="810.97" dur="4.38">think that Q has used these ellipses</text>
  <text start="812.8" dur="4.17">quite a bit then I think that that is</text>
  <text start="815.35" dur="6.3">what Q is responding to talking about</text>
  <text start="816.97" dur="7.38">evidence and it looks to me now like</text>
  <text start="821.65" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;ve got evidence on all of this and so</text>
  <text start="824.35" dur="4.32">despite the heavy redactions despite</text>
  <text start="826.45" dur="5.04">them removing the call from the tarmac</text>

  <text start="1021.96" dur="4.92">first post here classified five maybe a</text>
  <text start="1024.96" dur="4.14">possible six so could there be some</text>
  <text start="1026.88" dur="4.05">deals open that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;ve started the</text>
