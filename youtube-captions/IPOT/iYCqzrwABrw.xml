  <text start="234.12" dur="4.05">okay well I do want to point out that</text>
  <text start="236.37" dur="4.23">there&amp;#39;s going to be probably plenty of</text>
  <text start="238.17" dur="4.62">pushback and stalling with all this I</text>
  <text start="240.6" dur="5.1">have no idea how it&amp;#39;s all going to go</text>
  <text start="242.79" dur="4.92">down but I can&amp;#39;t imagine mr. Blanco just</text>
  <text start="245.7" dur="4.26">coughing that stuff right up just a</text>
  <text start="247.71" dur="4.5">suspicion but either way we see over</text>
  <text start="249.96" dur="4.62">here on post 3625 work you had said</text>
  <text start="252.21" dur="4.44">hunters become the hunted we&amp;#39;ve kind of</text>
  <text start="254.58" dur="4.11">suspected that this could be a reference</text>
  <text start="256.65" dur="4.47">to hunter Biden it looks like you is</text>
  <text start="258.69" dur="5.94">sort of HAP tipping that theory so</text>
  <text start="261.12" dur="5.31">indeed hunter becomes the hunted and of</text>
  <text start="264.63" dur="3.78">course it&amp;#39;s more than just hunter Biden</text>
  <text start="266.43" dur="3.84">we want to hear from our whistleblower</text>
  <text start="268.41" dur="4.5">too and these are people that they are</text>
  <text start="270.27" dur="5.61">going to likely get called to the Senate</text>
  <text start="272.91" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s why the Senate was the target I</text>
  <text start="275.88" dur="2.61">tweeted this the other day</text>
  <text start="276.87" dur="3.06">sure would suck if this whole</text>
  <text start="278.49" dur="3.179">impeachment thing went to the Senate</text>
  <text start="279.93" dur="3.15">where Trump could subpoena those who</text>
  <text start="281.669" dur="4.381">Democrats would never want to see</text>
  <text start="283.08" dur="4.77">testify as we all watch including fake</text>
  <text start="286.05" dur="5.07">news and the world</text>
  <text start="287.85" dur="4.89">oh yeah indeed c-span is gonna have to</text>
  <text start="291.12" dur="3.99">cover this right and that looks like</text>
  <text start="292.74" dur="3.81">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right here now now</text>
  <text start="295.11" dur="3.33">like I said I have a feeling there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="296.55" dur="4.38">probably going to be a lot of stalling</text>
  <text start="298.44" dur="3.84">in the seeking of these records keep in</text>
  <text start="300.93" dur="3.69">mind we&amp;#39;ve seen lots of letters</text>
  <text start="302.28" dur="5.04">demanding lots of things and letters</text>
  <text start="304.62" dur="3.99">aren&amp;#39;t always that serious but indeed we</text>
  <text start="307.32" dur="3.69">are starting to see this play out</text>
  <text start="308.61" dur="4.02">because the impeachment thing has really</text>
  <text start="311.01" dur="3.57">really blown over at this point</text>
  <text start="312.63" dur="4.68">Democrats don&amp;#39;t really seem to be all</text>
  <text start="314.58" dur="5.01">about it and it just seems to be kind of</text>
  <text start="317.31" dur="4.859">getting exposed for the circus that it</text>
  <text start="319.59" dur="3.24">is however this whole time queue has</text>
  <text start="322.169" dur="2.761">been saying</text>
  <text start="322.83" dur="4.08">Trump&amp;#39;s been hinting at this that the</text>
  <text start="324.93" dur="3.84">Senate was indeed the target and this is</text>
  <text start="326.91" dur="4.5">why so that now we can have our own</text>
  <text start="328.77" dur="4.38">subpoenas and of course the appointing</text>
  <text start="331.41" dur="3.63">of so many judges that we&amp;#39;ve seen over</text>
  <text start="333.15" dur="4.14">the last really ever since President</text>
  <text start="335.04" dur="5.1">Trump has taken the oath of office we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="337.29" dur="4.95">seen all kinds of judges getting put</text>
  <text start="340.14" dur="4.05">into positions at different levels and</text>
  <text start="342.24" dur="4.65">this is why so now it&amp;#39;s time to start</text>
  <text start="344.19" dur="4.8">playing some offense nice now we got</text>
  <text start="346.89" dur="5.16">some new documents in regards to Ukraine</text>

  <text start="907.97" dur="5.16">cooperating and B the NYPD is willing to</text>
  <text start="910.97" dur="4.29">have them cooperate in order to go after</text>
  <text start="913.13" dur="4.32">something bigger than this laptop</text>

  <text start="989.87" dur="4.53">that were really true patriots and</text>
  <text start="991.66" dur="5.53">starting to try and inject that back</text>

  <text start="997.19" dur="4.17">saying these guys were you know war</text>
  <text start="999.23" dur="3.99">criminals as opposed to true patriots</text>
  <text start="1001.36" dur="6.75">well that&amp;#39;s likely because this stuff is</text>
  <text start="1003.22" dur="6.78">coming up pain coming q post 36:27 38</text>
  <text start="1008.11" dur="3.9">minutes after the hour of 7 q says</text>

  <text start="1017.56" dur="5.19">interaction coming soon okay well let me</text>
  <text start="1020.59" dur="4.89">first refer you to this tweet from Ron</text>

  <text start="1043" dur="5.07">q and on is Q and on by this trip code</text>
  <text start="1045.34" dur="5.22">so Q understands this too and is letting</text>
  <text start="1048.07" dur="4.53">us know that in order to Rivera Phi as</text>
  <text start="1050.56" dur="4.5">opposed to just saying hey guys it&amp;#39;s me</text>
  <text start="1052.6" dur="4.41">Q is gonna have to show us some bang-up</text>
  <text start="1055.06" dur="3.78">proof right and some of the best proofs</text>
  <text start="1057.01" dur="4.29">are usually within these photographs</text>

  <text start="1068.62" dur="3.84">lot of these have to do with this</text>
  <text start="1069.97" dur="4.94">notebook the pen and this pen is this</text>
