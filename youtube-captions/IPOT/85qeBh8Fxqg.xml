  <text start="1466.28" dur="3.779">leads me to think that the ws was</text>
  <text start="1467.929" dur="3.87">Wasserman Schultz but I&amp;#39;m not really</text>
  <text start="1470.059" dur="5.701">sure but that was June actually excuse</text>

  <text start="1475.76" dur="4.53">up in arms about this whole Imran a one</text>

  <text start="1483.7" dur="3.57">check to even be there and it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1485.86" dur="3.99">just him and it was his brothers his</text>
  <text start="1487.27" dur="4.86">whole family was involved in all kinds</text>
  <text start="1489.85" dur="6.18">of things this really really sketchy car</text>
  <text start="1492.13" dur="5.37">company it was like a used-car lot and</text>
  <text start="1496.03" dur="3.42">they had all kinds of weird stuff his</text>
  <text start="1497.5" dur="5.01">brother had been fired from McDonald&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1499.45" dur="5.28">and still got coin and even after he he</text>
  <text start="1502.51" dur="3.78">had wired all this money to Pakistan it</text>
  <text start="1504.73" dur="3.03">looked like Debbie wasserman-schultz</text>
  <text start="1506.29" dur="3.99">just double down and kept him on the</text>
  <text start="1507.76" dur="5.01">payroll and of course then he was part</text>
  <text start="1510.28" dur="4.44">of the whole damaging the servers and</text>
  <text start="1512.77" dur="3.99">all that so this is really interesting</text>
  <text start="1514.72" dur="3.69">stuff and this is really where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1516.76" dur="4.53">going to find so much of the information</text>
