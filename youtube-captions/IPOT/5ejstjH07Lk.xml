  <text start="214.459" dur="3.78">the small case raising the possibility</text>
  <text start="216.26" dur="4.259">that small it could be recharged yeah</text>
  <text start="218.239" dur="3.72">he&amp;#39;s looking at like 16 felony charges</text>
  <text start="220.519" dur="3.931">I&amp;#39;m not so sure that it would get them</text>
  <text start="221.959" dur="4.351">all but he&amp;#39;s looking at the special</text>
  <text start="224.45" dur="3.539">prosecutor we&amp;#39;ll also look at how Fox in</text>
  <text start="226.31" dur="4.109">her office handled the decision to drop</text>
  <text start="227.989" dur="3.691">charges against the Empire actor and if</text>
  <text start="230.419" dur="2.85">you&amp;#39;ll remember there were some text</text>
  <text start="231.68" dur="3.239">messages that were going around and here</text>
  <text start="233.269" dur="3.15">they are right here - Kim Fox this is</text>
  <text start="234.919" dur="3.03">from Tina chin and if you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="236.419" dur="4.141">familiar with Tina chin she wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="237.949" dur="5.671">assistant to Barack Obama back when he</text>
  <text start="240.56" dur="4.98">was in the White House doing whatever he</text>
  <text start="243.62" dur="5.399">was doing in there and she was actually</text>
  <text start="245.54" dur="7.169">chief of staff to Barack Obama&amp;#39;s other</text>
  <text start="249.019" dur="6.75">half over there at the White House chief</text>
  <text start="252.709" dur="4.861">of staff and this is her message hi Kim</text>
  <text start="255.769" dur="3.33">I sent an email to your work address I</text>
  <text start="257.57" dur="4.56">think as well I wanted to give you a</text>
  <text start="259.099" dur="5.971">call on behalf a G Smollett and family</text>
  <text start="262.13" dur="4.71">who I know they have concerns about the</text>
  <text start="265.07" dur="3.39">investigation I want an 8:00 a.m. flight</text>
  <text start="266.84" dur="3.66">to New York City but please call me</text>
  <text start="268.46" dur="6">before then al and about 10:15 Chicago</text>
  <text start="270.5" dur="4.979">time my cell is redacted many things and</text>
  <text start="274.46" dur="2.699">as you can see we&amp;#39;re not gonna break</text>
  <text start="275.479" dur="3.93">into this real real big but this was</text>
  <text start="277.159" dur="4.051">from Tina Chin so obviously the Smollett</text>
  <text start="279.409" dur="4.621">family had some connections in hard</text>
  <text start="281.21" dur="4.59">places and so did Kim Fox all right so</text>
  <text start="284.03" dur="3">look all this yakety smacking he is</text>
  <text start="285.8" dur="2.73">basically saying we&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="287.03" dur="3.03">ourselves a do-over again they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="288.53" dur="4.04">look into this they&amp;#39;re gonna look into</text>
  <text start="290.06" dur="4.16">Fox they didn&amp;#39;t like the fact that</text>
  <text start="292.57" dur="3.81">there you basically had law enforcement</text>
  <text start="294.22" dur="3.99">and the representation talking to each</text>
  <text start="296.38" dur="3.27">other well that&amp;#39;s a big big no-no that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="298.21" dur="3.42">gonna bust this whole thing wide open</text>
  <text start="299.65" dur="4.11">and the reason why this is important is</text>
  <text start="301.63" dur="4.19">because although maybe you and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="303.76" dur="3.69">really follow Hollywood actors that much</text>
  <text start="305.82" dur="4.36">there are a lot of people that really</text>
  <text start="307.45" dur="4.89">still do and they were prepared to kind</text>
  <text start="310.18" dur="4.5">of write this off now he got clowned in</text>
  <text start="312.34" dur="4.14">the media about this but it really</text>
  <text start="314.68" dur="3.24">wasn&amp;#39;t a very very big deal and the</text>
  <text start="316.48" dur="3.09">important thing about this is that this</text>
  <text start="317.92" dur="3.78">guy was essentially trying to ignite a</text>
  <text start="319.57" dur="3.33">race war it was a really big deal but</text>
  <text start="321.7" dur="4.68">the thing that I want to point out is</text>
  <text start="322.9" dur="5.61">down here the Chicago sun-times was</text>
  <text start="326.38" dur="3.65">unable to reach small its attorneys so</text>
  <text start="328.51" dur="3.75">they ended up talking to this guy</text>
  <text start="330.03" dur="4.48">Northwestern University Law School</text>
  <text start="332.26" dur="3.84">professor Locke Bowman who successfully</text>
  <text start="334.51" dur="2.58">petitioned for the appointment of a</text>
  <text start="336.1" dur="4.08">special prosecutor to investigate</text>
  <text start="337.09" dur="4.89">allegations of torture by former CPD</text>
  <text start="340.18" dur="3.96">commander Jon Burge so now we&amp;#39;re turning</text>
  <text start="341.98" dur="3.36">it around said he was surprised to see</text>
  <text start="344.14" dur="3.51">small its case go into the books</text>
  <text start="345.34" dur="4.38">alongside other historic cases where an</text>
  <text start="347.65" dur="3.96">independent prosecutor was appointed now</text>
  <text start="349.72" dur="3.66">I just want to point out I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="351.61" dur="4.86">this Locke Bowen very well but he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="353.38" dur="5.52">graduate of Northwestern University Law</text>
  <text start="356.47" dur="4.56">School and if you watched my video the</text>
  <text start="358.9" dur="4.98">Weathermen that I just finished I worked</text>
  <text start="361.03" dur="4.95">all week on it last week you&amp;#39;ll note</text>
  <text start="363.88" dur="4.41">that I was talking about a lot of people</text>
  <text start="365.98" dur="5.7">that were related to the Northwestern</text>
  <text start="368.29" dur="4.83">University Law School just saying and</text>
  <text start="371.68" dur="3.78">then they bring him up and he was of</text>
  <text start="373.12" dur="4.56">course talking about commander Jon Burge</text>
  <text start="375.46" dur="3.57">and so it says here Bowman said he would</text>
  <text start="377.68" dur="2.79">not be surprised to see smaller charge</text>
  <text start="379.03" dur="3.69">again but based on information that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="380.47" dur="3.99">been made public he doubts Fox or her</text>
  <text start="382.72" dur="3.78">staff committed any wrongdoing that</text>
  <text start="384.46" dur="3.66">would rise to the level of crime or even</text>
  <text start="386.5" dur="3.62">a sanction okay well one peek at those</text>
  <text start="388.12" dur="5.64">text messages that I just showed you</text>
  <text start="390.12" dur="4.9">suggested otherwise right all right one</text>
  <text start="393.76" dur="4.05">more important thing that I want to</text>
  <text start="395.02" dur="6.09">point out this lady Tina Chen she was</text>
  <text start="397.81" dur="6.12">not only an assistant to Obama and a</text>
  <text start="401.11" dur="5.25">chief of staff to Michelle Obama but she</text>
  <text start="403.93" dur="5.47">was also a graduate from the</text>

  <text start="790.58" dur="3.72">you know I call the tech oligarchs</text>
  <text start="792.23" dur="4.83">whether it&amp;#39;s Twitter or Google or</text>
  <text start="794.3" dur="4.41">Facebook it always seems like most of</text>
  <text start="797.06" dur="3.06">the time it&amp;#39;s the Conservatives that get</text>
  <text start="798.71" dur="3.6">kicked off and you can&amp;#39;t see our</text>
  <text start="800.12" dur="4.83">platforms or we keep you can&amp;#39;t see us on</text>
  <text start="802.31" dur="5.31">their platforms where the the the left</text>
  <text start="804.95" dur="5.64">they get away with murder and so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="807.62" dur="4.47">this discovery process on Twitter starts</text>
  <text start="810.59" dur="3.54">tomorrow then of course we have more</text>
  <text start="812.09" dur="4.59">lawsuits that are on the way and I hate</text>
  <text start="814.13" dur="4.62">to be having to do this but it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="816.68" dur="3.95">the only way that this can that this</text>
  <text start="818.75" dur="3.66">problem can be fixed because if we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="820.63" dur="3.97">conservatives I think are going to be</text>
  <text start="822.41" dur="3.93">doomed in future elections because all</text>
  <text start="824.6" dur="3.11">of these tech companies are against us</text>
  <text start="826.34" dur="3.66">and I think Republicans and</text>
  <text start="827.71" dur="3.819">conservatives across the country need to</text>
  <text start="830" dur="3.839">understand this and they need to take</text>
  <text start="831.529" dur="4.56">now and the only remedy we have is the</text>
  <text start="833.839" dur="4.951">court are you are you concerned that</text>
  <text start="836.089" dur="4.86">Twitter will try to influence the</text>
  <text start="838.79" dur="5.07">election in 2020 by doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="840.949" dur="4.651">can like shadow bank etc and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="843.86" dur="3.93">already doing it yeah they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="845.6" dur="5.25">doing it I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s clear what</text>
  <text start="847.79" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;ve done to me is is ridiculous what</text>
  <text start="850.85" dur="3.209">they continue to do to others I mean you</text>
  <text start="852.47" dur="3.839">see people getting kicked off a Twitter</text>
  <text start="854.059" dur="3.75">for nothing you see the same thing</text>
  <text start="856.309" dur="4.291">happening at Facebook you see you know</text>
  <text start="857.809" dur="4.77">90 plus percent of all the searches go</text>
  <text start="860.6" dur="5.099">through Google we know that Google&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="862.579" dur="6.531">been actually blocking emails from going</text>
  <text start="865.699" dur="7.981">out so look there&amp;#39;s gonna be a number of</text>
  <text start="869.11" dur="6.849">legal congressmen well it&amp;#39;s it depends</text>
  <text start="873.68" dur="4.379">on if if there&amp;#39;s if you can prove it in</text>
  <text start="875.959" dur="4.05">court right so it takes people that are</text>
  <text start="878.059" dur="4.351">willing to step up and take these</text>
  <text start="880.009" dur="3.661">companies on which I&amp;#39;m willing to do not</text>
  <text start="882.41" dur="3.45">because I want to do it but because it</text>
  <text start="883.67" dur="5.279">has to be done because in the long run</text>
  <text start="885.86" dur="4.68">we can&amp;#39;t compete with if social media is</text>
  <text start="888.949" dur="3.3">totally against the conservatives in the</text>
  <text start="890.54" dur="4.649">Republican because they say they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="892.249" dur="4.861">media companies do you do you want to</text>
  <text start="895.189" dur="5.07">see legislation that puts them under the</text>
  <text start="897.11" dur="4.68">umbrella of media companies look I think</text>
  <text start="900.259" dur="3.69">the courts I mean what we&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="901.79" dur="4.739">is that that Twitter and these companies</text>
  <text start="903.949" dur="4.771">they&amp;#39;re content developers you know they</text>
  <text start="906.529" dur="4.441">claim to be oh we&amp;#39;re just an open public</text>
  <text start="908.72" dur="5.039">square we treat everybody equally well</text>
  <text start="910.97" dur="4.83">they don&amp;#39;t treat everybody equally it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="913.759" dur="4.171">not even close and so what what what I</text>
  <text start="915.8" dur="4.769">want is I want my day in court</text>
  <text start="917.93" dur="5.129">to go before a judge and a jury to</text>
  <text start="920.569" dur="6.181">explain how it is that Twitter treats</text>
  <text start="923.059" dur="5.76">conservatives differently than the left</text>
  <text start="926.75" dur="3.6">so there you have it and we&amp;#39;ve known for</text>
  <text start="928.819" dur="3.45">a while that this was coming but now it</text>
  <text start="930.35" dur="3.719">looks like we have a date and I most</text>
  <text start="932.269" dur="3.54">certainly will be watching this with</text>
  <text start="934.069" dur="5.13">great interest and of course sharing my</text>
  <text start="935.809" dur="5.731">findings with you this has obviously a</text>
  <text start="939.199" dur="4.411">lot of interest for myself as a content</text>
  <text start="941.54" dur="4.2">creator who is constantly getting my</text>
  <text start="943.61" dur="5.19">numbers manipulated Shadowman dealing</text>
  <text start="945.74" dur="5.099">with you know long uploads and even</text>
  <text start="948.8" dur="4.62">fairly recently what seems like veiled</text>
  <text start="950.839" dur="4.23">threats by YouTube so like I said as a</text>
  <text start="953.42" dur="2.969">content creator this means everything to</text>
  <text start="955.069" dur="2.49">me and please understand you know I get</text>
  <text start="956.389" dur="2.43">a lot of people saying you know a</text>
  <text start="957.559" dur="3.421">pageant don&amp;#39;t worry so much about your</text>
  <text start="958.819" dur="3.57">numbers bla bla bla bla well I am gonna</text>
  <text start="960.98" dur="3.279">worry about my numbers because this is a</text>
  <text start="962.389" dur="3.97">full-time job and although</text>
  <text start="964.259" dur="3.51">not gonna lose sleep over it I am gonna</text>
  <text start="966.359" dur="3.09">worry about it I wouldn&amp;#39;t walk up to a</text>
  <text start="967.769" dur="3.36">restaurant owner and say hey man I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="969.449" dur="3.78">gonna grab a hundred of your customers</text>
  <text start="971.129" dur="4.92">but don&amp;#39;t worry about those numbers yeah</text>
  <text start="973.229" dur="4.44">exactly so it&amp;#39;s important it&amp;#39;s important</text>
  <text start="976.049" dur="2.64">for all of us and it&amp;#39;s important you</text>
  <text start="977.669" dur="2.31">know I know that a lot of people have</text>
  <text start="978.689" dur="3.18">talked about migrating to other</text>
  <text start="979.979" dur="4.23">platforms and I most certainly am NOT</text>
  <text start="981.869" dur="3.69">against that I do think that this is</text>
  <text start="984.209" dur="3.66">probably going to transition into</text>
  <text start="985.559" dur="4.32">something new and you know one of these</text>
  <text start="987.869" dur="4.26">platforms whether it&amp;#39;s already out or FX</text>
  <text start="989.879" dur="4.41">has yet to be developed will probably</text>
  <text start="992.129" dur="3.75">kind of rise to the top and overtake it</text>
  <text start="994.289" dur="3.6">I have a feeling that YouTube will crush</text>
  <text start="995.879" dur="4.77">under its own weight not yet sure what</text>
  <text start="997.889" dur="5.461">to think about Facebook I think Twitter</text>
  <text start="1000.649" dur="5.55">very well is uh also is in trouble and</text>
  <text start="1003.35" dur="4.5">hopefully this at the very least this</text>
  <text start="1006.199" dur="4.38">case will bring some much-needed</text>
  <text start="1007.85" dur="4.199">attention to this because it&amp;#39;s one thing</text>
  <text start="1010.579" dur="2.88">for us to retreat into our own little</text>
  <text start="1012.049" dur="4.801">echo chamber but we&amp;#39;ve really achieved</text>
  <text start="1013.459" dur="5.67">nothing there and you know I like to</text>
  <text start="1016.85" dur="3.689">stay fairly libertarian in these ideals</text>
  <text start="1019.129" dur="2.85">and the fact that I understand if</text>
  <text start="1020.539" dur="3.45">somebody wants to create a platform and</text>
  <text start="1021.979" dur="5.011">say that so-and-so is not allowed them</text>
  <text start="1023.989" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s perfectly fine but the fact of</text>
  <text start="1026.99" dur="3.99">the matter is is that these people are</text>
  <text start="1028.519" dur="4.11">now buying up content for instance we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1030.98" dur="2.699">got Facebook now buying up content as a</text>
  <text start="1032.629" dur="3.03">matter of fact I think they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1033.679" dur="3.691">try and take over Netflix I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1035.659" dur="3.93">going to be a sort of their new route</text>
  <text start="1037.37" dur="4.769">not really sure but if that&amp;#39;s the case</text>
  <text start="1039.589" dur="4.25">then they are a content provider and the</text>
  <text start="1042.139" dur="5.04">rules tend to change a little bit so</text>
  <text start="1043.839" dur="5.531">having said all that you know I&amp;#39;ve yet</text>
  <text start="1047.179" dur="3.781">to form my my opinions completely but I</text>
