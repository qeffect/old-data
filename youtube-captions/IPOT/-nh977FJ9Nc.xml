  <text start="124.82" dur="3.81">a different service that has nothing to</text>
  <text start="126.74" dur="3.48">do with what they&amp;#39;re doing and they want</text>
  <text start="128.63" dur="3.48">us to disregard that now the middle one</text>

  <text start="138.07" dur="5.62">mitigations and then at the top H M is</text>
  <text start="140.959" dur="4.021">the first platform to be D platformed we</text>
  <text start="143.69" dur="3.359">are working hard to make sure that</text>
  <text start="144.98" dur="5.19">doesn&amp;#39;t happen again after we come back</text>
  <text start="147.049" dur="4.921">online okay so there you go it looks</text>
  <text start="150.17" dur="4.44">like we&amp;#39;re not really sure when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="151.97" dur="5.34">going to be seeing any Q posts if at all</text>
  <text start="154.61" dur="4.17">who knows what this will end up being</text>
  <text start="157.31" dur="3.6">but it looks like people are spending a</text>
  <text start="158.78" dur="4.86">lot of money to make sure that this</text>
  <text start="160.91" dur="4.35">happened and now we&amp;#39;ve seen no just as</text>
  <text start="163.64" dur="3.78">recently as today the Washington Post</text>
  <text start="165.26" dur="4.11">came up with a with an article about</text>
  <text start="167.42" dur="3.72">queueing on people are in a panic The</text>
  <text start="169.37" dur="5.04">Daily Beast huff Huffington Post they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="171.14" dur="4.62">all been doing hit pieces NBC and of</text>
  <text start="174.41" dur="3.78">course you have our knucklehead would</text>
  <text start="175.76" dur="4.14">Ben Collins went on on TV and he was</text>
  <text start="178.19" dur="4.53">talking about how much of an expert he</text>
  <text start="179.9" dur="4.86">is at queueing on even though he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="182.72" dur="3.93">ever reference q and on but you see</text>
  <text start="184.76" dur="4.02">what&amp;#39;s up this is very serious stuff now</text>
  <text start="186.65" dur="3.38">this would just be a guess if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="188.78" dur="3.65">wagering it I want to offer</text>
  <text start="190.03" dur="4.14">as such it wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise me if we</text>
  <text start="192.43" dur="4.139">start seeing some sort of litigation</text>
  <text start="194.17" dur="3.899">against queuing on and that might open</text>
  <text start="196.569" dur="3.111">up some really interest in doors</text>
  <text start="198.069" dur="3.781">although it most certainly doesn&amp;#39;t seem</text>
  <text start="199.68" dur="5.17">like something we&amp;#39;d want to go through</text>
  <text start="201.85" dur="5.79">but remember queuing on has often said</text>
  <text start="204.85" dur="4.26">how do you legally inject evidence and</text>
  <text start="207.64" dur="4.23">it seems like sometimes in order to get</text>
  <text start="209.11" dur="5.43">certain things into the public scope of</text>
  <text start="211.87" dur="4.35">vision properly it almost seems like</text>
  <text start="214.54" dur="3.33">you&amp;#39;d have to put litigation on them in</text>
  <text start="216.22" dur="3.87">order for queuing on to defend</text>
  <text start="217.87" dur="4.11">themselves and of course if the deep</text>
  <text start="220.09" dur="3.81">state is actually confronted with that</text>
  <text start="221.98" dur="4.17">that will put them in a conundrum now</text>
  <text start="223.9" dur="4.11">that is my guess and my guess alone I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="226.15" dur="4.2">sure there&amp;#39;s other anons who think a lot</text>
  <text start="228.01" dur="3.87">of kind of similar stuff to that but</text>
  <text start="230.35" dur="3.63">that would just be my guest wagering</text>
  <text start="231.88" dur="4.26">this because right now obviously we had</text>
  <text start="233.98" dur="5.28">the whole epstein situation we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="236.14" dur="6.3">Peter struck suing to basically get his</text>
  <text start="239.26" dur="4.86">old gig back and you know it obviously</text>
  <text start="242.44" dur="3.03">just seems like a whole bunch of madness</text>
  <text start="244.12" dur="3.75">but really what this really seems to me</text>
  <text start="245.47" dur="5.75">he&amp;#39;s a time to collect and start</text>
  <text start="247.87" dur="7.14">harvesting those crops being those</text>
  <text start="251.22" dur="5.71">farm-raised CIA knuckleheads all those</text>
  <text start="255.01" dur="4.44">free-range knuckleheads while they&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="256.93" dur="4.619">their break so that&amp;#39;s my guess that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="259.45" dur="4.11">what we got so far but most certainly if</text>
  <text start="261.549" dur="4.771">anything updates from code monkey or</text>
  <text start="263.56" dur="5.729">from HN themselves I will keep you</text>
  <text start="266.32" dur="5.31">posted and lo and behold almost as if to</text>
  <text start="269.289" dur="4.891">support my point beautifully we get this</text>

  <text start="390.41" dur="5.97">Q simply just said shut down now I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="393.5" dur="5.07">had a lot of different people kind of</text>
  <text start="396.38" dur="3.87">proposing that these ten days of</text>
  <text start="398.57" dur="3.54">darkness would happen really every</text>
  <text start="400.25" dur="4.23">couple months every time Q would go dark</text>

  <text start="406.01" dur="5.13">happen but Q is saying here shut down</text>

  <text start="483.41" dur="3.03">close like I said when I first put it</text>
  <text start="485.03" dur="3.66">out I thought I was pretty close to done</text>
  <text start="486.44" dur="3.45">until I ran up on some big stories and I</text>
  <text start="488.69" dur="3.51">really think they need to be part of</text>
  <text start="489.89" dur="4.32">that so thanks for your support</text>
  <text start="492.2" dur="3.36">and hopefully if anybody that you see is</text>
  <text start="494.21" dur="3.45">asking you can kind of refer them to</text>
  <text start="495.56" dur="3.96">that answer but when it&amp;#39;s ready to come</text>
  <text start="497.66" dur="3.9">out I will get you a new trailer and</text>
  <text start="499.52" dur="4.41">that will give you an idea that it</text>
  <text start="501.56" dur="4.56">should be done pretty soon so until then</text>
  <text start="503.93" dur="4.32">I am probably going to back off on some</text>
  <text start="506.12" dur="3.81">of the daily updates and probably just</text>
  <text start="508.25" dur="3.33">do maybe every other couple days or</text>
  <text start="509.93" dur="2.33">something like that something so I can</text>
  <text start="511.58" dur="2.63">kind of have a</text>
  <text start="512.26" dur="3.659">it&amp;#39;s between giving you some content</text>
  <text start="514.21" dur="3.33">with the news that&amp;#39;s going on and still</text>
  <text start="515.919" dur="3.721">at the same time take those much-needed</text>
  <text start="517.54" dur="4.62">days to put the time in and really</text>
  <text start="519.64" dur="3.96">really it&amp;#39;s quite an extensive research</text>
  <text start="522.16" dur="3.51">that we&amp;#39;re trying to put into this so</text>
  <text start="523.6" dur="3.84">thank you very much for all that and I</text>
  <text start="525.67" dur="3.42">want to add a side note to that in my</text>
  <text start="527.44" dur="3.72">searches I actually stumbled onto a new</text>
  <text start="529.09" dur="4.08">topic that I&amp;#39;m also going to do a</text>
  <text start="531.16" dur="3.69">full-length on and I think you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
