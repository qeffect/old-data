  <text start="40.309" dur="4.831">Mac welcome to August and you know what</text>
  <text start="42.89" dur="6.32">they say the month of August is</text>
  <text start="45.14" dur="4.07">traditionally very hot</text>
  <text start="53.94" dur="6.26">when it&amp;#39;s hot you got to keep it cool</text>
  <text start="56.28" dur="3.92">John John how many cute pose we got I</text>
  <text start="60.739" dur="4.6">know it&amp;#39;s a little difficult to explain</text>
  <text start="63.629" dur="3.541">so let me see what I can do here but</text>
  <text start="65.339" dur="4.171">before we do we got a flashbac but not</text>
  <text start="67.17" dur="9.93">real far we&amp;#39;ll just do a really quick</text>
  <text start="69.51" dur="8.25">flashback taking you back not really far</text>
  <text start="77.1" dur="2.61">at all</text>
  <text start="77.76" dur="3.54">I guess just yesterday or maybe the day</text>
  <text start="79.71" dur="7.38">before depending on where you live I</text>
  <text start="81.3" dur="7.86">guess anyway post 35 49 50 and 51 now</text>
  <text start="87.09" dur="4.29">are inserted now from what I can</text>
  <text start="89.16" dur="4.44">understand Q has deleted these off of</text>
  <text start="91.38" dur="3.54">either the Research Board and the</text>
  <text start="93.6" dur="3.18">Patriots fight board they&amp;#39;re no longer</text>
  <text start="94.92" dur="4.229">there but they may have showed up and</text>
  <text start="96.78" dur="4.259">that&amp;#39;s why because these showed up later</text>
  <text start="99.149" dur="3.241">they were probably manually inserted by</text>
  <text start="101.039" dur="3.991">the people who operate these separate</text>
  <text start="102.39" dur="4.68">boards after grabbing them off of each</text>
  <text start="105.03" dur="3.99">hand so that&amp;#39;s what my I&amp;#39;m guessing</text>
  <text start="107.07" dur="3.18">happened I&amp;#39;m not really 100% sure but</text>
  <text start="109.02" dur="2.489">we&amp;#39;ve got some new ones and I just want</text>
  <text start="110.25" dur="3.119">to show them to you really quick we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="111.509" dur="4.411">talk about them in a second but we have</text>
  <text start="113.369" dur="4.471">35 49 they&amp;#39;re all stringers here 13</text>
  <text start="115.92" dur="6.089">minutes after the hour 1 this package D</text>
  <text start="117.84" dur="6.389">- G route and then our ELB whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="122.009" dur="4.231">a relay or who knows - 9 1 8 to</text>
  <text start="124.229" dur="3.39">underscore why and then we have what</text>
  <text start="126.24" dur="5.51">looks to be some sort of clock countdown</text>
  <text start="127.619" dur="6.901">+ 4 + 3 + 2 now real quick on this one</text>
  <text start="131.75" dur="4.93">the first thing I thought I found online</text>
  <text start="134.52" dur="4.049">was this right here information</text>
  <text start="136.68" dur="4.529">technology sensor network sensor network</text>
  <text start="138.569" dur="5.691">reference architecture part 5 interface</text>
  <text start="141.209" dur="6.291">definitions you can see that&amp;#39;s iso/iec</text>
  <text start="144.26" dur="5.77">291 8 - so this is what popped up</text>
  <text start="147.5" dur="4.36">provides definitions and requirements of</text>
  <text start="150.03" dur="4.05">sent work sensor network interfaces of</text>
  <text start="151.86" dur="4.05">the entities in the sensor network</text>
  <text start="154.08" dur="3.81">reference architecture and covers the</text>
  <text start="155.91" dur="3.689">following aspects interfaces between</text>
  <text start="157.89" dur="3.27">functional layers to provide service</text>
  <text start="159.599" dur="3.841">access for the modules and the upper</text>
  <text start="161.16" dur="4.23">layer to exchange messages with modules</text>
  <text start="163.44" dur="3.99">on the lower layer interfaces between</text>
  <text start="165.39" dur="4.26">entities introduced in the sensor</text>
  <text start="167.43" dur="3.96">network reference architecture enabling</text>
  <text start="169.65" dur="4.229">sensor network services and applications</text>
  <text start="171.39" dur="4.319">so I&amp;#39;m not really sure if that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="173.879" dur="3.631">that is is that some sort of computer</text>
  <text start="175.709" dur="4.201">command all of these do look like</text>
  <text start="177.51" dur="3.69">computer commands and then we see kind</text>
  <text start="179.91" dur="3.3">of a familiar one here and we&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="181.2" dur="3.87">about a little bit more about this one</text>
  <text start="183.21" dur="4.44">in a minute 19 minutes after the hour</text>
  <text start="185.07" dur="5.19">135 50 we have underscore</text>
  <text start="187.65" dur="5.16">hot eight hot nine and underscore red</text>
  <text start="190.26" dur="3.809">underscore red underscore Y underscore</text>
  <text start="192.81" dur="3.599">and then we have underscore freedom</text>
  <text start="194.069" dur="7.2">underscore mark 1 through 99 underscore</text>
  <text start="196.409" dur="6.33">y PC underscore cig D and I&amp;#39;m assuming</text>
  <text start="201.269" dur="4.621">that it would be maybe caller confirmed</text>
  <text start="202.739" dur="4.83">Network or conference network w1 not</text>
  <text start="205.89" dur="3.39">really sure but again it looks like some</text>
  <text start="207.569" dur="2.431">commands but let me just move on to this</text>
  <text start="209.28" dur="4.47">one real quick</text>
  <text start="210" dur="6.989">3550 126 minutes out to be our 1 we get</text>
  <text start="213.75" dur="5.01">what looks to be missing there may be</text>
  <text start="216.989" dur="4.201">some elements missing to this string or</text>
  <text start="218.76" dur="6">maybe it&amp;#39;s purposely set this way we see</text>
  <text start="221.19" dur="6.78">that D - G 3 + 1 - 2 could be 1 or 2</text>
  <text start="224.76" dur="4.83">hours not really sure insert key not</text>
  <text start="227.97" dur="3.299">really sure you computer guys can tell</text>
  <text start="229.59" dur="3.569">me what you think this looks obviously</text>
  <text start="231.269" dur="4.351">it looks like some set of computer</text>
  <text start="233.159" dur="4.561">commands now let me take you back to 35</text>
  <text start="235.62" dur="4.17">50 really quick where we&amp;#39;ve seen a very</text>
  <text start="237.72" dur="3.48">familiar post like this before now hang</text>
  <text start="239.79" dur="2.789">with me here cuz I&amp;#39;m not so sure I have</text>
  <text start="241.2" dur="3.27">this all right I just want to show you</text>
  <text start="242.579" dur="5.671">what I&amp;#39;m seeing I want to refer you to</text>
  <text start="244.47" dur="5.73">this post here 522 from January 14 2018</text>
  <text start="248.25" dur="3.87">and I don&amp;#39;t want to break down all these</text>
  <text start="250.2" dur="3.3">codes cuz I don&amp;#39;t really know what all</text>
  <text start="252.12" dur="2.64">these are they look like some sort of</text>
  <text start="253.5" dur="4.289">this obviously looks like some sort of</text>
  <text start="254.76" dur="5.219">authorization code and but we see these</text>
  <text start="257.789" dur="3.961">familiar hots now I tend to think that</text>
  <text start="259.979" dur="3.75">we might be talking about satellites and</text>
  <text start="261.75" dur="3.96">I&amp;#39;ve mentioned this before in regards to</text>
  <text start="263.729" dur="3.541">these you know what you want to call</text>
  <text start="265.71" dur="3.84">pound signs hashtag remember some</text>
  <text start="267.27" dur="3.69">signals or whatever but with the fly and</text>
  <text start="269.55" dur="2.13">sometimes it&amp;#39;ll have some of these name</text>
  <text start="270.96" dur="2.329">in it</text>
  <text start="271.68" dur="3.57">could that be something to do with</text>
  <text start="273.289" dur="3.581">communications done in a skiff or</text>
  <text start="275.25" dur="5.28">communications that are picked up over</text>
  <text start="276.87" dur="4.56">satellite not really sure in this case I</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="3.84">kind of thought that these were</text>
  <text start="281.43" dur="4.26">satellite coms and each hop might be a</text>
  <text start="284.37" dur="2.91">separate satellite and it might be</text>
  <text start="285.69" dur="3.15">talking about their status because they</text>
  <text start="287.28" dur="3.09">all kind of have different commands</text>
  <text start="288.84" dur="4.35">after all most of them have this pre</text>
  <text start="290.37" dur="5.07">underscore D now I could be way wrong it</text>
  <text start="293.19" dur="4.86">could be computer you know some sort of</text>
  <text start="295.44" dur="5.55">computer code to enact satellites or</text>
  <text start="298.05" dur="4.98">enact coms I don&amp;#39;t really know but down</text>
  <text start="300.99" dur="4.02">here at the bottom says as the world</text>
  <text start="303.03" dur="3.33">turns and that&amp;#39;s what I wanted to turn</text>
  <text start="305.01" dur="3.36">you on to because that&amp;#39;s a catchphrase</text>
  <text start="306.36" dur="4.61">that we&amp;#39;ve seen quite a few times and I</text>
  <text start="308.37" dur="6.299">want to flash a few different cue posts</text>
  <text start="310.97" dur="5.499">that have this saying in it they seem to</text>
  <text start="314.669" dur="3.631">come around times we&amp;#39;ve suspected that</text>
  <text start="316.469" dur="3.681">there have been attempts on the POTUS is</text>
  <text start="318.3" dur="5.089">life now</text>
  <text start="320.15" dur="5.16">the reason I think that is because if</text>
  <text start="323.389" dur="4.771">you will remember back in the day the</text>
  <text start="325.31" dur="7.079">assassination of JFK it was actually</text>
  <text start="328.16" dur="5.97">announced during a showing of the after</text>
  <text start="332.389" dur="4.5">world terms - which is an old soap opera</text>
  <text start="334.13" dur="6.3">on TV and it was preempted with the</text>
  <text start="336.889" dur="5.611">announcement of his his assassination</text>
  <text start="340.43" dur="4.41">and so that&amp;#39;s what led me to think this</text>
  <text start="342.5" dur="5.19">a long time ago I still tend to think</text>
  <text start="344.84" dur="4.139">that this could be the possibility and</text>
  <text start="347.69" dur="3.3">they may be kind of just letting us know</text>
  <text start="348.979" dur="3.471">that this was an attack thwarted it</text>
  <text start="350.99" dur="3.39">could be in regards to these</text>
  <text start="352.45" dur="5.59">communications like I said these were</text>
  <text start="354.38" dur="5.88">taken off by q excuse choice to remove</text>
  <text start="358.04" dur="4.56">those before these even came up in the</text>
  <text start="360.26" dur="3.57">first place so I&amp;#39;m not really sure and</text>
  <text start="362.6" dur="4.56">then it follows up here with Jeremiah</text>
  <text start="363.83" dur="5.1">29:11 which I believe is for for is I</text>
  <text start="367.16" dur="4.86">who know the plans for you sorry I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="368.93" dur="5.4">really have a quote there but you get</text>
  <text start="372.02" dur="5.07">the idea right so this is my guest now</text>
  <text start="374.33" dur="4.8">also keep in mind that as the world</text>
  <text start="377.09" dur="4.199">turns like I just said was a very famous</text>
  <text start="379.13" dur="4.56">soap opera from way back in the day and</text>
  <text start="381.289" dur="5.431">it&amp;#39;s still running now but one of the</text>
  <text start="383.69" dur="5.37">writers for that was one Agnes Nixon and</text>
  <text start="386.72" dur="6.06">we talked about her a while back - Agnes</text>
  <text start="389.06" dur="6.109">Nixon longtime writer and of course her</text>
  <text start="392.78" dur="5.67">daughter had been hanging with all these</text>
  <text start="395.169" dur="4.991">Rothschilds and definitely had some</text>
  <text start="398.45" dur="4.89">creepy connections herself James</text>
  <text start="400.16" dur="4.77">Alif on ttis was in her crew and then</text>
  <text start="403.34" dur="5.22">her daughter which would be Agnes Nixon</text>
  <text start="404.93" dur="5.28">Nixon&amp;#39;s granddaughter was Wendy Nixon</text>
  <text start="408.56" dur="4.89">and we see her right there we&amp;#39;ve also</text>
  <text start="410.21" dur="5.22">seen her pictured with Obama which leads</text>
  <text start="413.45" dur="5.43">me to think that this is probably part</text>
  <text start="415.43" dur="5.7">of another Network hint hint wink wink</text>
  <text start="418.88" dur="4.259">okay so I don&amp;#39;t want to go way into that</text>
  <text start="421.13" dur="3.84">story right now because it could be more</text>
  <text start="423.139" dur="4.471">complicated and I might be gloriously</text>
  <text start="424.97" dur="5.61">wrong but we knew that this Nixon family</text>
  <text start="427.61" dur="5.309">was tied up with not only the Hollywood</text>
  <text start="430.58" dur="5.22">elite but we also knew that this girl</text>
  <text start="432.919" dur="4.651">kept popping up in Obama&amp;#39;s pictures and</text>
  <text start="435.8" dur="3.27">every time we would see this as the</text>
  <text start="437.57" dur="3.9">world turns I kept thinking about that</text>
  <text start="439.07" dur="5.099">connection James Oliphant is with comet</text>
  <text start="441.47" dur="5.64">ping-pong and this of course also ties</text>
  <text start="444.169" dur="4.651">in with nexium - but I don&amp;#39;t want to go</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="4.799">too crazy with that let me take you back</text>
  <text start="448.82" dur="4.77">to 35 50 and this was this stringer</text>
  <text start="451.909" dur="4.051">right here hot eight hot nine</text>
  <text start="453.59" dur="5.76">so I&amp;#39;m not sure if these are connections</text>
  <text start="455.96" dur="5.31">to some particular satellites or if</text>
  <text start="459.35" dur="3.48">we&amp;#39;re confirming a new network not</text>
  <text start="461.27" dur="3.6">really sure you can let me know but the</text>
  <text start="462.83" dur="5.339">other curious thing that I found about</text>
  <text start="464.87" dur="5.46">this post was this 1 through 99 let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.169" dur="3.72">have a look at 1 through 99 these are</text>
  <text start="470.33" dur="3.99">some of the most recent times that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="471.889" dur="5.101">seen 1 through 99 we see it the last</text>
  <text start="474.32" dur="5.19">time here in Post 3423 this was the 12th</text>
  <text start="476.99" dur="4.71">of July talking about wheels up and</text>
  <text start="479.51" dur="3.96">wheels up was that private flight kind</text>
  <text start="481.7" dur="3.68">of like uber that we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="483.47" dur="4.56">might have been very much like a</text>
  <text start="485.38" dur="5.86">Epstein&amp;#39;s lolita kind of Express -</text>
  <text start="488.03" dur="4.92">talking about wheels up flight logs and</text>
  <text start="491.24" dur="4.739">then we&amp;#39;re here we see it classified 1</text>
  <text start="492.95" dur="6.06">through 99 under investigation by FBI</text>
  <text start="495.979" dur="5.551">and DOJ so maybe we are talking about</text>
  <text start="499.01" dur="4.71">the kitties now this is post 34 11 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="501.53" dur="4.859">a long one here on July 11th I just want</text>
  <text start="503.72" dur="4.23">to take you to the middle here the</text>
  <text start="506.389" dur="3.631">mindset at most if the majority of</text>
  <text start="507.95" dur="3.3">people believe this then this must be</text>
  <text start="510.02" dur="5.22">more true than that</text>
  <text start="511.25" dur="5.64">CIA classified through 1 through 99 56</text>
  <text start="515.24" dur="4.29">humans psychological and emotional</text>
  <text start="516.89" dur="5.1">distress without public support they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="519.53" dur="4.91">powerless we the people hold the power</text>
  <text start="521.99" dur="4.95">ok so we do seem to be talking about</text>
  <text start="524.44" dur="5.74">kitties right and let me take you to one</text>
  <text start="526.94" dur="5.91">more here 33 96 this is from the 10th of</text>
  <text start="530.18" dur="5.85">July and again we&amp;#39;re talking about Bill</text>
  <text start="532.85" dur="5.7">Clinton and Ray Chandler Epstein plate</text>
  <text start="536.03" dur="4.559">plating pick and the Ray Chandler was</text>
  <text start="538.55" dur="3.69">another similar you know kind of</text>
  <text start="540.589" dur="3">character this young pretty girl though</text>
  <text start="542.24" dur="2.91">we didn&amp;#39;t know where where she was</text>
  <text start="543.589" dur="2.881">turning up but she kept turning up in</text>
  <text start="545.15" dur="4.439">all these pictures with all these</text>
  <text start="546.47" dur="6.75">different stars and she ends up being</text>
  <text start="549.589" dur="5.821">this sort of go-to person for this whole</text>
  <text start="553.22" dur="5.01">pedo Network right and once again we see</text>
  <text start="555.41" dur="4.98">that classified 1 through 99 what age is</text>
  <text start="558.23" dur="4.59">Ray Chandler in the picture under the</text>
  <text start="560.39" dur="5.28">age of 18 what queue says it&amp;#39;s in its 15</text>
  <text start="562.82" dur="4.86">so I have to say that in regards to this</text>
  <text start="565.67" dur="4.23">latest stringer it sounds like some sort</text>
  <text start="567.68" dur="5.31">of communications or something that may</text>
  <text start="569.9" dur="4.08">have to do with some of these flights so</text>
  <text start="572.99" dur="3.39">there you go that&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="573.98" dur="4.35">connected so far I&amp;#39;m not so sure how</text>
  <text start="576.38" dur="3.81">much of that is really on point but keep</text>
  <text start="578.33" dur="4.32">in mind POTUS was also on the move due</text>
  <text start="580.19" dur="4.23">to the rally so it wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise me</text>
  <text start="582.65" dur="2.59">if people are always trying to get to</text>

  <text start="673.97" dur="3.69">factors leading to the DOJ declining to</text>

  <text start="683.93" dur="4.08">ending up with the press okay so I just</text>
  <text start="686.45" dur="2.85">want to note something real quick here</text>
  <text start="688.01" dur="2.88">cuz I know there&amp;#39;s a lot of people that</text>
  <text start="689.3" dur="3.12">are really upset about this and I just</text>
  <text start="690.89" dur="3.84">want to point out you&amp;#39;re fine to me what</text>
  <text start="692.42" dur="4.14">we can feel whatever you want but this</text>
  <text start="694.73" dur="5.22">makes a whole lot of sense here now just</text>
  <text start="696.56" dur="6.15">hear this again first of all these are</text>
  <text start="699.95" dur="5.49">these memos here which we knew we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="705.44" dur="3.36">classified they were marked as</text>
  <text start="706.58" dur="4.98">confidential so if you want to go ahead</text>
  <text start="708.8" dur="4.71">and try and prosecute Comey they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="711.56" dur="3.96">saying that they don&amp;#39;t think it can be</text>
  <text start="713.51" dur="4.35">prosecuted and even if it were it would</text>
  <text start="715.52" dur="3.6">be a super super light sentence because</text>
  <text start="717.86" dur="3.06">like I said these weren&amp;#39;t marked</text>
  <text start="719.12" dur="4.74">classified they were marked confidential</text>
  <text start="720.92" dur="5.76">and showing that the FBI classified it</text>
  <text start="723.86" dur="4.83">after the fact just shows that this is</text>
  <text start="726.68" dur="3.87">there isn&amp;#39;t really what they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="728.69" dur="3.78">going after Comey for this doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="730.55" dur="3.57">that commis off the hook and I think</text>
  <text start="732.47" dur="2.79">that that&amp;#39;s very important because I</text>
  <text start="734.12" dur="2.76">think there&amp;#39;s a lot of people that like</text>

  <text start="801.26" dur="6.42">what is being suggested here once DNI</text>

  <text start="823.579" dur="3.991">memos are confidential so I would say</text>
  <text start="825.89" dur="2.639">don&amp;#39;t believe the hype you&amp;#39;re welcome to</text>

  <text start="834.38" dur="3.84">around the country at the corner yeah I</text>
  <text start="836.75" dur="3.12">think what this is really is is to just</text>
  <text start="838.22" dur="3.809">show some optics and start warming</text>
  <text start="839.87" dur="2.909">people up look the mother thing has just</text>

  <text start="855.74" dur="4.38">know this because I&amp;#39;m starting to see</text>
  <text start="857.209" dur="4.201">numbers rise again finally you know I</text>
  <text start="860.12" dur="2.7">think that we&amp;#39;re all starting to see</text>
  <text start="861.41" dur="3.359">that again there&amp;#39;s a renewed interest</text>
  <text start="862.82" dur="3.99">there&amp;#39;s a reason for that people are</text>
  <text start="864.769" dur="4.56">starting to realize that what James</text>
  <text start="866.81" dur="4.98">nobody&amp;#39;s telling me Comey was saying</text>
  <text start="869.329" dur="3.991">just wasn&amp;#39;t true and you need a public</text>
  <text start="871.79" dur="3.57">understanding of that if they just went</text>
  <text start="873.32" dur="4.05">ahead and arrested him you can imagine</text>
  <text start="875.36" dur="3.24">the kind of blowback that president</text>
  <text start="877.37" dur="3.6">Trump would receive and it wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="878.6" dur="3.75">good for optics so as slow as this is</text>
  <text start="880.97" dur="3.9">keep in mind that we&amp;#39;re playing</text>
  <text start="882.35" dur="4.2">for 2020 this is not just a four-year</text>

  <text start="886.55" dur="3.69">that long game you might not be ready to</text>
  <text start="888.41" dur="4.14">play this game at all because that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="890.24" dur="4.68">this goes now I&amp;#39;m not saying just be</text>
  <text start="892.55" dur="4.17">patient and be blind and be naive but</text>
  <text start="894.92" dur="3.72">this makes sense to me and if I if you</text>
  <text start="896.72" dur="3.6">can reason against it you&amp;#39;re welcome to</text>
  <text start="898.64" dur="3.36">do that down below let&amp;#39;s move on to</text>
