  <text start="260.94" dur="2.7">conservative voices you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="262.289" dur="3.121">necessarily have to be a conservative</text>
  <text start="263.64" dur="4.32">voice to understand the importance of</text>
  <text start="265.41" dur="5.879">this big tech has long been shutting out</text>
  <text start="267.96" dur="5.07">our voices and it&amp;#39;s been extreme I can</text>
  <text start="271.289" dur="4.38">tell you only just from my own</text>
  <text start="273.03" dur="4.38">experience as a content creator not only</text>
  <text start="275.669" dur="4.141">do I deal with this every day I deal</text>
  <text start="277.41" dur="6.06">with it every single moment of every</text>
  <text start="279.81" dur="5.04">single day every tweet every video I</text>
  <text start="283.47" dur="3.21">couldn&amp;#39;t even begin to tell you the</text>
  <text start="284.85" dur="4.47">number of experiences and I&amp;#39;ve logged</text>
  <text start="286.68" dur="5.16">all of mine in I&amp;#39;ve got my own folders</text>
  <text start="289.32" dur="4.56">and stuff of screenshots of different</text>
  <text start="291.84" dur="4.11">activities your comments all kinds of</text>
  <text start="293.88" dur="4.68">things showing this kind of bias just</text>
  <text start="295.95" dur="4.77">for when the time is right to use it so</text>
  <text start="298.56" dur="4.62">who knows when I&amp;#39;m gonna unload my own</text>
  <text start="300.72" dur="3.87">can but it looks like AG bars gonna be</text>
  <text start="303.18" dur="4.47">doing that in addition to dealing with</text>
  <text start="304.59" dur="4.92">this Muller report but this is great</text>
  <text start="307.65" dur="4.62">news all the way around and the real</text>
  <text start="309.51" dur="4.77">kicker of this is as and I would suggest</text>
  <text start="312.27" dur="3.6">bringing this point up if you are</text>
  <text start="314.28" dur="3.27">debating your friends who are simply</text>
  <text start="315.87" dur="3.57">saying well these are private platforms</text>
  <text start="317.55" dur="3.48">and they can do whatever they want</text>
  <text start="319.44" dur="3.75">and normally they would be right except</text>
  <text start="321.03" dur="4.83">for a couple big big kickers number one</text>
  <text start="323.19" dur="4.65">the obvious is that unless let&amp;#39;s say a</text>
  <text start="325.86" dur="3.57">group like YouTube or Facebook or</text>
  <text start="327.84" dur="3.63">whatnot unless they actually state their</text>
  <text start="329.43" dur="5.01">rules or in their rules or exactly what</text>
  <text start="331.47" dur="4.17">it is that&amp;#39;s gonna get you banned you</text>
  <text start="334.44" dur="3.15">know to just go ahead and come up with</text>
  <text start="335.64" dur="3.99">these nebulous reasons for blocking and</text>
  <text start="337.59" dur="3.99">banning your videos isn&amp;#39;t good enough</text>
  <text start="339.63" dur="3.96">because it&amp;#39;s not stated in their rules</text>
  <text start="341.58" dur="3.54">now their rules say hey conservatives</text>
  <text start="343.59" dur="3.12">not allowed then that&amp;#39;s one thing</text>
  <text start="345.12" dur="3.06">because you know that going into it but</text>
  <text start="346.71" dur="3.42">that&amp;#39;s not what they&amp;#39;re doing is it</text>
  <text start="348.18" dur="3.96">however there&amp;#39;s another even more</text>
  <text start="350.13" dur="4.47">important point I think is that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="352.14" dur="4.38">discovered all this money that groups</text>
  <text start="354.6" dur="3.93">like Facebook which we basically know is</text>
  <text start="356.52" dur="3.57">DARPA right this is essentially life log</text>
  <text start="358.53" dur="4.26">from back in the day this is all</text>
  <text start="360.09" dur="4.71">Pentagon Pentagon funding and we see</text>
  <text start="362.79" dur="3.81">this through groups like George Soros</text>
  <text start="364.8" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s funding groups like Facebook and</text>
  <text start="366.6" dur="4.26">all these tech giants these go through</text>
  <text start="369.09" dur="4.11">PACs and they go through all sorts of</text>
  <text start="370.86" dur="4.68">initiatives that essentially go back to</text>
  <text start="373.2" dur="5.25">our tax dollars so if our tax dollars</text>
  <text start="375.54" dur="4.47">funding these groups then and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="378.45" dur="3.27">have the right to kick us off and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="380.01" dur="3.09">the real kicker there and I have a</text>
  <text start="381.72" dur="3.89">feeling that that&amp;#39;s probably what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="383.1" dur="4.59">going to discover in some of this</text>
  <text start="385.61" dur="5.11">investigation and I think it&amp;#39;s also up</text>
  <text start="387.69" dur="5.76">to Patriots like yourself and myself to</text>
  <text start="390.72" dur="5.1">keep bringing that to light and really</text>
  <text start="393.45" dur="4.04">really highlight that hypocrisy at the</text>
  <text start="395.82" dur="4.53">end of the day I think the average</text>
  <text start="397.49" dur="5.11">American the average Patriot worldwide</text>
  <text start="400.35" dur="4.8">whether they&amp;#39;re left-leaning center or</text>
  <text start="402.6" dur="3.66">whatever you want to say I think</text>
  <text start="405.15" dur="4.32">everybody wants to have their voice</text>
  <text start="406.26" dur="4.53">heard and it&amp;#39;s always easy to win</text>
  <text start="409.47" dur="3.21">someone else that you don&amp;#39;t agree with</text>
  <text start="410.79" dur="3.629">is you know dealing with that kind of</text>
  <text start="412.68" dur="4.23">stuff but I think once it really comes</text>
  <text start="414.419" dur="4.351">down to them and I&amp;#39;ll just leave one</text>
  <text start="416.91" dur="4.44">more case in point before I get off of</text>
  <text start="418.77" dur="4.11">this topic as many of you probably know</text>
  <text start="421.35" dur="3.06">I&amp;#39;m a huge basketball fan and so I</text>
  <text start="422.88" dur="3.57">follow some basketball channels on</text>
  <text start="424.41" dur="3.66">YouTube just because I enjoy the sport</text>
  <text start="426.45" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s kind of a nice break for me</text>
  <text start="428.07" dur="3.75">and I noticed even one of my favorite</text>
  <text start="430.29" dur="3.87">channels who really talks about nothing</text>
  <text start="431.82" dur="4.62">but basketball was dealing with issues</text>
  <text start="434.16" dur="3.93">with YouTube also and they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="436.44" dur="3.93">to wake up and realize that this is</text>
  <text start="438.09" dur="5.61">affecting all of us that&amp;#39;s a big deal</text>
  <text start="440.37" dur="6.66">for you and for me let&amp;#39;s move on</text>
  <text start="443.7" dur="4.47">post 34 69 12 minutes after the hour of</text>

  <text start="816.209" dur="4.351">trade that we&amp;#39;re starting to see is just</text>

  <text start="932.18" dur="6.12">his apparent sympathy with these</text>
  <text start="934.339" dur="6.361">left-wing aims I wonder why for example</text>
  <text start="938.3" dur="3.96">last summer radical left-wing activists</text>
  <text start="940.7" dur="3.69">surrounded a Portland Immigration and</text>
  <text start="942.26" dur="4.26">Customs Enforcement Building trapping</text>

  <text start="958.209" dur="5.231">particularly from a federal agency that</text>
  <text start="960.92" dur="5.01">he believed to be on the wrong track</text>
  <text start="963.44" dur="4.769">okay so he spoken out a lot about the</text>
  <text start="965.93" dur="3.96">police out there and of course we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="968.209" dur="3.451">getting some really disturbing video</text>
  <text start="969.89" dur="4.41">also from New York you probably guys</text>
  <text start="971.66" dur="4.53">have seen the video New York cops</text>
  <text start="974.3" dur="3.51">getting doused with water and whatnot</text>
  <text start="976.19" dur="3">this happened in a few places it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="977.81" dur="3.57">really really terrible stuff and it</text>
  <text start="979.19" dur="3.78">looks like Portland&amp;#39;s mayor Ted wheeler</text>
  <text start="981.38" dur="4.53">is all about it and of course this seems</text>
  <text start="982.97" dur="5.73">to be a hotbed for an Tifa who is acting</text>
  <text start="985.91" dur="4.2">very much like a terrorist organization</text>
  <text start="988.7" dur="3.81">and of course they&amp;#39;re quick to speak out</text>
  <text start="990.11" dur="3.78">about the Ku Klux Klan but I</text>
  <text start="992.51" dur="3.96">honestly I don&amp;#39;t know that I&amp;#39;ve seen a</text>
  <text start="993.89" dur="4.71">Ku Klux Klan rally in I don&amp;#39;t know a</text>
  <text start="996.47" dur="3.15">long time maybe I&amp;#39;m wrong about that but</text>
  <text start="998.6" dur="2.88">they&amp;#39;re it&amp;#39;s amazing how they&amp;#39;re always</text>
  <text start="999.62" dur="4.41">talking about that and yet an Tifa is</text>
  <text start="1001.48" dur="5.31">still walking around but the idea here</text>
  <text start="1004.03" dur="5.46">is really interesting we&amp;#39;ve long known</text>
  <text start="1006.79" dur="4.23">that groups like George Soros has been</text>
  <text start="1009.49" dur="3.78">funding groups like this or how about</text>
  <text start="1011.02" dur="4.98">Tom Styer over there Common Sense Media</text>
  <text start="1013.27" dur="4.74">which seems to be anything but and of</text>
  <text start="1016" dur="4.26">course he&amp;#39;s been teasing a presidential</text>
  <text start="1018.01" dur="5.25">bid himself likely because he&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1020.26" dur="4.8">panic panic panic and I&amp;#39;m gonna talk</text>
  <text start="1023.26" dur="5.64">about this in a future video too but I</text>
  <text start="1025.06" dur="6.12">also want to point out that our boy from</text>
  <text start="1028.9" dur="5.34">The Weather Underground Tom Ayers is</text>
  <text start="1031.18" dur="4.98">also funding these groups so you know</text>
  <text start="1034.24" dur="3.36">there&amp;#39;s a lot of money going into these</text>
  <text start="1036.16" dur="2.85">groups and that&amp;#39;s how these knuckleheads</text>
  <text start="1037.6" dur="3.42">get out there they don&amp;#39;t go start in</text>
  <text start="1039.01" dur="4.26">trouble for free and if you&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="1041.02" dur="3.9">anything about antiva you can see that</text>
  <text start="1043.27" dur="3.929">clearly they&amp;#39;re not expressing any kind</text>
  <text start="1044.92" dur="3.84">of political views they&amp;#39;re there to some</text>
  <text start="1047.199" dur="3.391">basically crack some heads and make a</text>
  <text start="1048.76" dur="3.48">whole bunch of trouble right that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1050.59" dur="3.24">deal so this RICO Act should be big</text>
  <text start="1052.24" dur="3.96">because not only will it look into an</text>
  <text start="1053.83" dur="5.34">Tifa but it&amp;#39;s likely going to look into</text>
  <text start="1056.2" dur="5.25">the funding of antiva and how people</text>
  <text start="1059.17" dur="4.41">like mayor Ted wheeler are involved not</text>
  <text start="1061.45" dur="3.9">just him but he&amp;#39;s a very clear example</text>
  <text start="1063.58" dur="3.33">and Christopher Ray was just testifying</text>
  <text start="1065.35" dur="3.78">before the Senate Judiciary Committee</text>
