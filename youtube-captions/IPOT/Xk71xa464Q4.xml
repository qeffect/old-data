  <text start="377.38" dur="5.039">that this was likely fake I pointed out</text>
  <text start="379.569" dur="4.59">that even the queue that was drawn on</text>
  <text start="382.419" dur="3.391">his hand would be very very suspect if</text>
  <text start="384.159" dur="3.48">this guy was actually being held on</text>

  <text start="403" dur="3.599">look original right but what&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="404.919" dur="3.601">important is that when we see this kind</text>
  <text start="406.599" dur="3.211">of deflection going on to Kuna which is</text>
  <text start="408.52" dur="2.73">obviously what they&amp;#39;re going after</text>

  <text start="864.46" dur="4.59">about is kind of a timetable to remember</text>
  <text start="866.89" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s really really crucial that we win</text>

  <text start="880.06" dur="5.4">change then we need to be able to vote</text>
  <text start="882.13" dur="6.45">for that and as we&amp;#39;ve talked about fire</text>
  <text start="885.46" dur="4.38">or the IG report or whether it&amp;#39;s all the</text>

  <text start="893.41" dur="4.02">that&amp;#39;s just that&amp;#39;s just not true</text>
  <text start="894.87" dur="4.48">thousands of people have been arrested</text>

  <text start="904.15" dur="4.05">true what I think those people really</text>
  <text start="905.77" dur="4.8">want to say is that nobody that they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="908.2" dur="5.88">like to see arrested has been arrested</text>
  <text start="910.57" dur="6.27">and that is true but I do want to point</text>
  <text start="914.08" dur="4.62">out that very much like you keeps</text>
  <text start="916.84" dur="4.05">reiterating that this is not just a four</text>
