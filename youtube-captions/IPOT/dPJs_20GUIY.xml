  <text start="119.799" dur="4.02">interesting pigs I wanted to share some</text>
  <text start="121.569" dur="5.071">of these this is from a mosque in Syria</text>
  <text start="123.819" dur="5.851">the Khalid bin Walid mosque in Homs</text>
  <text start="126.64" dur="5.7">Syria so I don&amp;#39;t think this is just</text>
  <text start="129.67" dur="5.28">indicative of bath houses although there</text>
  <text start="132.34" dur="6.09">could be a bathhouse inside that mosque</text>
  <text start="134.95" dur="5.7">um just saying but if you will remember</text>
  <text start="138.43" dur="4.649">Homs was the area that got here really</text>
  <text start="140.65" dur="4.32">really hard last year when we were doing</text>
  <text start="143.079" dur="3.63">some shelling and if you followed my</text>
  <text start="144.97" dur="5.28">channel for a while we were talking</text>
  <text start="146.709" dur="4.801">about no name became out there and that</text>
  <text start="150.25" dur="3.989">was the whole area that was getting</text>
  <text start="151.51" dur="4.89">pelted and we found tons and tons of</text>
  <text start="154.239" dur="3.931">tunnels out there as a matter of fact we</text>
  <text start="156.4" dur="4.52">were talking about these spiderweb</text>
  <text start="158.17" dur="5.37">tunnels and that was what we saw no name</text>
  <text start="160.92" dur="5.68">pictured in front of right so here is</text>
  <text start="163.54" dur="5.849">one from Syria and here we have our Raja</text>
  <text start="166.6" dur="4.65">Mosque in Mecca Saudi Arabia and as you</text>
  <text start="169.389" dur="3.301">can see they&amp;#39;ve got the stripeys down</text>
  <text start="171.25" dur="2.7">here and up there they have the</text>
  <text start="172.69" dur="3.389">squigglies the other one had little</text>
  <text start="173.95" dur="4.95">squigglies in it too so stripeys and</text>
  <text start="176.079" dur="4.171">squigglies are a check now let&amp;#39;s take</text>
  <text start="178.9" dur="3.6">another look at this structure on</text>
  <text start="180.25" dur="4.23">Epstein Island I&amp;#39;m considered that this</text>
  <text start="182.5" dur="3.93">dome is no longer there whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="184.48" dur="3.42">been physically removed or actually blew</text>
  <text start="186.43" dur="3.149">off in the storm like they tell us I</text>
  <text start="187.9" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t really know but it&amp;#39;s no longer</text>
  <text start="189.579" dur="3.091">there and that&amp;#39;s what matters we see the</text>
  <text start="191.59" dur="3.299">stripeys there I don&amp;#39;t see any</text>
  <text start="192.67" dur="4.77">squigglies there but we see the stripeys</text>
  <text start="194.889" dur="5.311">and a lot of people have maintained that</text>
  <text start="197.44" dur="4.829">that is Maalik up there the birds on the</text>
  <text start="200.2" dur="3.99">on the building there I do not believe</text>
  <text start="202.269" dur="3.571">that to be true I still maintain that</text>
  <text start="204.19" dur="3.54">this is a Phoenix I&amp;#39;m about to explain</text>
  <text start="205.84" dur="3.54">why as you can see there there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="207.73" dur="3.509">picture of a Phoenix you can see the</text>
  <text start="209.38" dur="3.84">similar plumes the thinner head</text>
  <text start="211.239" dur="3.36">owls just don&amp;#39;t look like that to me but</text>
  <text start="213.22" dur="3.449">I&amp;#39;m gonna explain a little bit more</text>
  <text start="214.599" dur="4.801">thoroughly why I do believe this to be a</text>
  <text start="216.669" dur="4.111">Phoenix and why it matters the</text>
  <text start="219.4" dur="2.7">Phoenicians</text>
  <text start="220.78" dur="3.39">they were the ancient Phoenicians who</text>
  <text start="222.1" dur="3.99">actually I believe probably had Moloch</text>
  <text start="224.17" dur="4.32">as part of their worship but they</text>
  <text start="226.09" dur="5.07">settled in Carthage which is now known</text>
  <text start="228.49" dur="5.16">as Tunisia and they had a really high</text>
  <text start="231.16" dur="5.16">infant mortality rate and I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="233.65" dur="4.68">very very relevant it led a lot of</text>
  <text start="236.32" dur="5.1">scholars to long believed that child</text>
  <text start="238.33" dur="4.77">sacrifice was part of their routine as a</text>
  <text start="241.42" dur="3.539">matter of fact it was believed that they</text>
  <text start="243.1" dur="4.83">were supposed to sacrifice annually</text>
  <text start="244.959" dur="6.871">child of nobility from a noble family</text>
  <text start="247.93" dur="5.94">and that was long kind of been the rumor</text>
  <text start="251.83" dur="4.32">but they actually did some research they</text>
  <text start="253.87" dur="6.089">just an excavation it was the university</text>
  <text start="256.15" dur="6.36">of sassari in Italy they went to Zama</text>
  <text start="259.959" dur="4.531">Tunisia and unearthed a whole bunch of</text>
  <text start="262.51" dur="5.19">remains and they did find a whole bunch</text>
  <text start="264.49" dur="4.56">of resting places the kvapil Issus but</text>
  <text start="267.7" dur="4.65">what they also found that was really</text>
  <text start="269.05" dur="5.67">really disturbing were about 6,000 urns</text>
  <text start="272.35" dur="4.71">and in these urns that contained the</text>
  <text start="274.72" dur="5.43">bones and the fetuses of stillborn</text>
  <text start="277.06" dur="5.22">babies which leads me to think that</text>
  <text start="280.15" dur="4.65">that&amp;#39;s probably why this Planned</text>
  <text start="282.28" dur="4.5">Parenthood thing is so pervasive and how</text>
  <text start="284.8" dur="4.08">it connects to the Epstein Island thing</text>
  <text start="286.78" dur="5.19">and why I believe this to be a Phoenix</text>
  <text start="288.88" dur="5.31">also involves seem to have been some</text>
  <text start="291.97" dur="4.17">sort of fire so whatever they were all</text>
  <text start="294.19" dur="3.69">these children that they found there was</text>
  <text start="296.14" dur="3.72">there was obviously fire involved or at</text>
  <text start="297.88" dur="4.44">least that was part of their study which</text>
  <text start="299.86" dur="5.4">also suggests the idea of the Phoenix</text>
  <text start="302.32" dur="4.95">which rises from its own ashes so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="305.26" dur="3.78">just my suggestion obviously you guys</text>
  <text start="307.27" dur="3.81">know I&amp;#39;m not great with some symbolism</text>
  <text start="309.04" dur="4.41">not like something you guys are but that</text>
  <text start="311.08" dur="4.589">would be my thoughts on that and if so</text>
  <text start="313.45" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s definitely creepy I would imagine</text>
  <text start="315.669" dur="4.261">the Phoenicians worshipped Baal and a</text>
  <text start="317.83" dur="4.32">lot of times they would celebrate that</text>
  <text start="319.93" dur="4.11">by building archways and dedicating them</text>
  <text start="322.15" dur="4.68">to bile and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="324.04" dur="5.43">significance in these old archways now</text>
  <text start="326.83" dur="4.32">when in relation to this building here</text>
  <text start="329.47" dur="3.06">it looks like like it&amp;#39;s just a facade</text>
  <text start="331.15" dur="2.7">and that it&amp;#39;s painted it doesn&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="332.53" dur="3.27">like they&amp;#39;ve actually built that archway</text>
  <text start="333.85" dur="3.87">but I do want to point out that the</text>
  <text start="335.8" dur="4.65">Keystone is very very important in</text>
  <text start="337.72" dur="4.38">Masonic lore basically you have the</text>
  <text start="340.45" dur="3.39">cornerstone which is the first stone</text>
  <text start="342.1" dur="3.39">laid and then the Keystone which is the</text>
  <text start="343.84" dur="2.97">last stone I&amp;#39;m really one of the most</text>
  <text start="345.49" dur="3.9">important because it holds the whole</text>
  <text start="346.81" dur="5.37">thing together these archways used to be</text>
  <text start="349.39" dur="4.889">a kind of a feat an architectural feat</text>
  <text start="352.18" dur="3.629">because it&amp;#39;s such a difficult process</text>
  <text start="354.279" dur="3.9">and it would allow them to allow more</text>
  <text start="355.809" dur="4.32">natural light in we can go off on that</text>
  <text start="358.179" dur="4.95">for a long time but I just want to point</text>
  <text start="360.129" dur="5.55">out that I do think the Keystone is kind</text>
  <text start="363.129" dur="6.27">of key and if you&amp;#39;ll remember that last</text>
  <text start="365.679" dur="7.32">year around October during the Cavanaugh</text>
  <text start="369.399" dur="6.62">hearings this arch of it was the arch of</text>
  <text start="372.999" dur="5.4">Palmeira from Syria was a recreated in</text>
  <text start="376.019" dur="4.36">DC and there you can see it right there</text>
  <text start="378.399" dur="3.87">and you can see clearly how important</text>
  <text start="380.379" dur="4.26">that Keystone is right there as a matter</text>
  <text start="382.269" dur="4.2">of fact it looks like you it kind of</text>
  <text start="384.639" dur="3.87">holds it all together even though</text>
  <text start="386.469" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re missing a couple blocks above it</text>
  <text start="388.509" dur="3.36">but this definitely has a lot of</text>
  <text start="390.519" dur="3.72">symbolism much of which I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="391.869" dur="4.11">completely understand but I know that it</text>
  <text start="394.239" dur="2.97">has some things to do with Baal worship</text>
  <text start="395.979" dur="3.06">and really I think at the end of the day</text>
  <text start="397.209" dur="5.13">invoking the goddess which essentially</text>
  <text start="399.039" dur="6.78">comes down to Jupiter and I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="402.339" dur="5.46">why we&amp;#39;re seeing so much trans pushing</text>
  <text start="405.819" dur="3.57">of this trans agenda and whatnot because</text>
  <text start="407.799" dur="4.32">I think they&amp;#39;re really trying to invoke</text>
  <text start="409.389" dur="4.86">this sort of goddess spirit if you will</text>
  <text start="412.119" dur="6.15">but that&amp;#39;s about all I&amp;#39;ve got on this</text>
  <text start="414.249" dur="6">for now let&amp;#39;s move on those 34:47 comes</text>

  <text start="480.759" dur="3.81">anybody now I do want to point out that</text>
  <text start="482.889" dur="3.42">I think there might be some sort of</text>

  <text start="504.76" dur="3.96">particular that we need to be looking</text>
  <text start="506.41" dur="4.47">for in relation to the word divided but</text>
  <text start="508.72" dur="3.81">I think outwardly at least we understand</text>
  <text start="510.88" dur="3.93">the idea they&amp;#39;ve been trying to divide</text>
  <text start="512.53" dur="3.72">us over race religion culture whatnot</text>
  <text start="514.81" dur="3.06">and they&amp;#39;re still doubling down on it</text>
  <text start="516.25" dur="3.33">and it&amp;#39;s just getting really really ugly</text>
  <text start="517.87" dur="4.38">at this point and I think for the</text>
  <text start="519.58" dur="4.5">average citizen regardless of their</text>
