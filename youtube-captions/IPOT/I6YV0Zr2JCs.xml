  <text start="323.13" dur="3.57">kind of style but the fact of the matter</text>
  <text start="324.66" dur="4.02">is that he&amp;#39;s using the same techniques</text>
  <text start="326.7" dur="4.44">that they are repeating a couple of</text>
  <text start="328.68" dur="4.38">these things even really anybody doesn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="347.61" dur="3.93">when you were divided and angry and</text>
  <text start="349.47" dur="4.86">controlled you target those different</text>
  <text start="351.54" dur="4.89">from you not those responsible and we</text>
  <text start="354.33" dur="3.93">have controllers and brackets divided</text>
  <text start="356.43" dur="3.93">you are weak divided you pose no threat</text>
  <text start="358.26" dur="4.65">to their control when non-dogmatic</text>
  <text start="360.36" dur="4.68">information becomes free and transparent</text>
  <text start="362.91" dur="4.77">it becomes a threat to those attempt to</text>
  <text start="365.04" dur="5.79">control the narrative and or stable and</text>
  <text start="367.68" dur="4.77">we have livestock kept sheep in brackets</text>
  <text start="370.83" dur="3.63">and they really do think you are sheep</text>
  <text start="372.45" dur="3.84">and they&amp;#39;ve proudly admitted it you can</text>
  <text start="374.46" dur="3.99">see a lot of these mainstream media</text>
  <text start="376.29" dur="4.86">collectives over the years they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="378.45" dur="5.61">oftentimes referred to us as sheep or</text>
  <text start="381.15" dur="5.1">livestock they openly admit it when you</text>
  <text start="384.06" dur="4.26">awake you stand on the outside of the</text>
  <text start="386.25" dur="4.02">stable groups think collective and have</text>
  <text start="388.32" dur="4.11">free thought free thought is a</text>
  <text start="390.27" dur="4.38">philosophical viewpoint which holds that</text>
  <text start="392.43" dur="4.26">positions regarding truth should be</text>
  <text start="394.65" dur="3.93">formed on the basis of logic reason and</text>
  <text start="396.69" dur="6.18">empiricism rather than Authority</text>
  <text start="398.58" dur="6.51">tradition revelation or Dogma q ok so I</text>
  <text start="402.87" dur="3.84">think you see what Q is highlighting</text>
  <text start="405.09" dur="3.42">this edition of the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="406.71" dur="4.11">something that many of us are very</text>
  <text start="408.51" dur="5.07">familiar with and I think overall the</text>
  <text start="410.82" dur="5.909">average citizen is aware of it on some</text>
  <text start="413.58" dur="4.44">level but maybe not to the extent of it</text>
  <text start="416.729" dur="3.421">and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s really important to</text>
  <text start="418.02" dur="4.89">know but he was definitely pointing it</text>
  <text start="420.15" dur="4.59">out and Trump has been stepping up his</text>
  <text start="422.91" dur="4.77">rhetoric against the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="424.74" dur="4.35">likely because the incoming censorship</text>
  <text start="427.68" dur="4.02">is here right</text>
  <text start="429.09" dur="4.56">it is stepping up I know a lot of people</text>

  <text start="435.39" dur="3.12">you</text>
  <text start="436.38" dur="3.57">this it&amp;#39;s here and we&amp;#39;ve said it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="438.51" dur="2.88">coming for a long time we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="439.95" dur="3.24">exactly how it&amp;#39;s coming on which</text>
  <text start="441.39" dur="4.05">platform it&amp;#39;s coming we just kind of</text>
  <text start="443.19" dur="4.41">have to survive the storm when it comes</text>
  <text start="445.44" dur="4.2">to that but we do know that it&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="447.6" dur="5.28">and like I talked about yesterday we</text>
  <text start="449.64" dur="5.73">have the night which is going to be the</text>
  <text start="452.88" dur="4.23">five cert release then we have the tenth</text>
  <text start="455.37" dur="4.56">which is where YouTube is changing their</text>
  <text start="457.11" dur="4.58">their policy changes officially taking</text>
  <text start="459.93" dur="4.74">place on the tenth and then we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="461.69" dur="5.11">Horowitz on the 11th so it seems to all</text>
  <text start="464.67" dur="3.81">kind of fall in line whether or not</text>
  <text start="466.8" dur="3.63">that&amp;#39;s exactly how it goes we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="468.48" dur="5.19">really know but it&amp;#39;s a pretty easy</text>
  <text start="470.43" dur="5.13">litmus test to go by we know something</text>
  <text start="473.67" dur="3.45">is coming and when we know something is</text>
  <text start="475.56" dur="5.25">coming we know it comes to the form of</text>
  <text start="477.12" dur="5.97">censorship now a while back when Q was</text>
  <text start="480.81" dur="4.02">kind of it&amp;#39;s in its earlier stages we</text>
  <text start="483.09" dur="4.5">would see a lot more subtext in these</text>
  <text start="484.83" dur="4.92">bracketed words I&amp;#39;m not so sure that</text>
  <text start="487.59" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s the case in this post it seems</text>
  <text start="489.75" dur="4.98">like it&amp;#39;s just used for emphasis but I</text>
  <text start="492.81" dur="3.87">just noticed that these right here in</text>
  <text start="494.73" dur="5.04">the middle you notice would control over</text>
  <text start="496.68" dur="6.87">of these and then a couple lines down it</text>
  <text start="499.77" dur="5.07">says would control over of these and I</text>
  <text start="503.55" dur="3.72">just thought that was a little curious</text>
  <text start="504.84" dur="5.13">in comparison to the rest of the ones in</text>
  <text start="507.27" dur="4.11">brackets on this post is that suggesting</text>
  <text start="509.97" dur="3.48">that there&amp;#39;s a bit of a dichotomy there</text>
  <text start="511.38" dur="4.13">would control over of is somebody</text>
  <text start="513.45" dur="5.67">referring to what control they have over</text>
  <text start="515.51" dur="5.77">these MSM conglomerates and maybe that</text>
  <text start="519.12" dur="4.44">that&amp;#39;s been either seized or changed or</text>
  <text start="521.28" dur="3.84">subverted who knows you guys can let me</text>
  <text start="523.56" dur="3.03">know I just wanted to point out that it</text>
  <text start="525.12" dur="3.81">was curious and it was the same line</text>
  <text start="526.59" dur="4.95">being repeated and the line before it</text>
  <text start="528.93" dur="4.56">where Q says read again digest so I</text>
  <text start="531.54" dur="3.18">think we understand the general idea</text>
  <text start="533.49" dur="5.34">though you guys can let me know about</text>
  <text start="534.72" dur="7.32">the brackets and we&amp;#39;re moving on post 36</text>

  <text start="614.37" dur="5.43">allegedly altering a document related to</text>

  <text start="622.53" dur="4.05">matter told CNN all right just that</text>
  <text start="624.87" dur="5.49">first sentence there&amp;#39;s a lot to unpack</text>
  <text start="626.58" dur="5.16">right there who is that FBI official are</text>
  <text start="630.36" dur="2.91">we talking about Peter struck or</text>
  <text start="631.74" dur="4.65">somebody who may be reported to Peter</text>

  <text start="636.39" dur="4.38">surveillance of a Trump campaign adviser</text>
  <text start="638.22" dur="4.74">likely could be Carter Paige I suppose</text>
  <text start="640.77" dur="4.11">you could be referring to Paul manna for</text>
  <text start="642.96" dur="3.96">both of them have faces on them right</text>
  <text start="644.88" dur="4.62">we&amp;#39;re of course talking about Carter</text>
  <text start="646.92" dur="5.55">Paige Paul manna for George papadopolis</text>
  <text start="649.5" dur="5.55">and of course general Flynn now general</text>
  <text start="652.47" dur="6.57">Flynn we know because of Sidney Powell</text>
  <text start="655.05" dur="6.48">had his 302s altar and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="659.04" dur="5.1">Lisa Paige Peter struck text messages</text>
  <text start="661.53" dur="4.68">kind of expose that that&amp;#39;s what Sidney</text>
  <text start="664.14" dur="4.17">Powell has kind of been uncovering over</text>
  <text start="666.21" dur="5.79">time and remember those 302s would have</text>
  <text start="668.31" dur="5.87">been a basis for his FISA warrant so it</text>
  <text start="672" dur="5.09">seems like altered documents are</text>
  <text start="674.18" dur="5.83">basically leading up to faulty FISA</text>
  <text start="677.09" dur="5.08">surveillance warrants so this implicates</text>
  <text start="680.01" dur="4.08">a lot of people because it doesn&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="682.17" dur="4.08">implicate the FBI officials who I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="684.09" dur="4.14">suspecting are likely either struck in</text>
  <text start="686.25" dur="5.25">Paige or related to struck in Paige</text>
  <text start="688.23" dur="5.61">somehow but either way they seem to be</text>
  <text start="691.5" dur="4.65">involved in the altering of these</text>
  <text start="693.84" dur="6.15">documents now it also says several</text>
  <text start="696.15" dur="6">people briefed on the matter told CNN so</text>
  <text start="699.99" dur="4.29">it sounds like we&amp;#39;ve also got some</text>
  <text start="702.15" dur="3.84">leakers going on and that&amp;#39;s the point</text>
  <text start="704.28" dur="4.5">that Q is making through these posts</text>

  <text start="869.73" dur="3.75">Twitter or social media why is no one</text>
  <text start="871.56" dur="3.99">talking about this why is no one doing</text>
  <text start="873.48" dur="3.39">this well the fact of the matter is is</text>
  <text start="875.55" dur="3.15">if you&amp;#39;re sitting on a story or if</text>
  <text start="876.87" dur="4.14">you&amp;#39;re sitting on some sort of thing</text>
  <text start="878.7" dur="3.96">that needs to get out you really need to</text>
  <text start="881.01" dur="4.35">take responsibility for yourself at this</text>
  <text start="882.66" dur="4.65">point we are at war Patriots and the</text>
  <text start="885.36" dur="3.51">reason I like what Veronica does is good</text>
  <text start="887.31" dur="3.48">because some people maybe can&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="888.87" dur="3.3">videos some people can&amp;#39;t make memes some</text>
  <text start="890.79" dur="3.63">people can&amp;#39;t do this or that or whatever</text>
  <text start="892.17" dur="4.44">but you can do whatever it is that you</text>
  <text start="894.42" dur="4.26">can do and Veronica found a unique way</text>
  <text start="896.61" dur="4.2">to do what she can do and that is to</text>
  <text start="898.68" dur="4.11">make banners as you can see her banner</text>
  <text start="900.81" dur="4.38">is a banner did you see what she did</text>
  <text start="902.79" dur="4.56">there cuz it&amp;#39;s a banner</text>
  <text start="905.19" dur="4.17">it says the people&amp;#39;s bridge indeed and</text>
  <text start="907.35" dur="3.93">so Veronica goes out there and she makes</text>
  <text start="909.36" dur="3.75">these banners and tons and tons of</text>
  <text start="911.28" dur="3.36">people go by they honk maybe they hate</text>
  <text start="913.11" dur="3.57">the message maybe they love the message</text>
  <text start="914.64" dur="4.53">but the fact that matter is they see the</text>
  <text start="916.68" dur="4.53">message and Veronica goes out daily and</text>
  <text start="919.17" dur="4.32">engages people physically by making</text>
  <text start="921.21" dur="4.92">these banners and exposing this message</text>
  <text start="923.49" dur="4.83">to probably millions of people the</text>
  <text start="926.13" dur="5.52">effect of this is hard to really measure</text>
  <text start="928.32" dur="5.25">right so thanks to you Veronica for all</text>
  <text start="931.65" dur="3.99">you do and thanks for sharing your own</text>
  <text start="933.57" dur="4.05">unique perspective which is really my</text>
  <text start="935.64" dur="3.63">bigger point is that we all have</text>
  <text start="937.62" dur="3.39">something that we can contribute in our</text>
  <text start="939.27" dur="3.75">own way if you&amp;#39;re really wanting to</text>
  <text start="941.01" dur="3.9">contribute I&amp;#39;m sure that you can figure</text>
  <text start="943.02" dur="4.68">it out but don&amp;#39;t put it on someone else</text>
  <text start="944.91" dur="4.53">who already is doing something when you</text>
  <text start="947.7" dur="4.92">have the power to do it yourself and</text>
  <text start="949.44" dur="5.58">Veronica is a classic example of that so</text>
  <text start="952.62" dur="4.86">congratulations to Veronica well</text>

  <text start="1401.47" dur="8.73">have voting a and 193 voting nay now i</text>
  <text start="1407.46" dur="4.78">like the article said i do think it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1410.2" dur="4.77">fair assessment to note that just</text>
  <text start="1412.24" dur="3.9">because the republicans were voting nay</text>
  <text start="1414.97" dur="3.42">on this does not mean they were</text>
  <text start="1416.14" dur="3.99">necessarily opposed to this surveillance</text>

  <text start="1420.13" dur="3.63">curious timing and i do think it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1421.75" dur="4.11">very important to keep on top of this</text>
  <text start="1423.76" dur="4.26">also i wanted to point out that it&amp;#39;s a</text>
