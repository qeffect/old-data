  <text start="614.11" dur="4.44">right here this is a treaty between the</text>
  <text start="615.64" dur="6.21">United States and Ukraine signed in July</text>
  <text start="618.55" dur="5.49">of 1998 I believe we talked about this</text>
  <text start="621.85" dur="4.41">once before I know we talked about it on</text>
  <text start="624.04" dur="4.47">Twitter and as you can see here is the</text>
  <text start="626.26" dur="5.01">letter of transmittal from one William</text>
  <text start="628.51" dur="4.38">Jay Clinton and I just want to read the</text>
  <text start="631.27" dur="3.81">middle part right there the treaty is</text>
  <text start="632.89" dur="4.62">one of a series of modern mutual legal</text>
  <text start="635.08" dur="4.08">assistance treaties being negotiated by</text>
  <text start="637.51" dur="3.93">the United States in order to counter</text>
  <text start="639.16" dur="4.08">criminal activities more effectively the</text>
  <text start="641.44" dur="3.81">treaty should be an effective tool to</text>

  <text start="649.81" dur="4.19">self-executing it provides for a broad</text>
  <text start="652.12" dur="4.53">range of cooperation in criminal matters</text>
  <text start="654" dur="5.08">mutual assistance available under the</text>
  <text start="656.65" dur="4.59">treaty includes taking of testimony or</text>

  <text start="684.28" dur="4.56">prohibited by laws of the requested</text>
  <text start="685.99" dur="5.07">state okay so this sounds like a pretty</text>
  <text start="688.84" dur="4.17">big boomerang right I have a feeling</text>
  <text start="691.06" dur="2.69">this was probably originally drafted to</text>
  <text start="693.01" dur="3.47">kind of</text>
  <text start="693.75" dur="5.46">detect from prosecution of all those</text>
  <text start="696.48" dur="4.98">things right there however it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="699.21" dur="4.02">seem to be the case now let&amp;#39;s take a</text>
  <text start="701.46" dur="4.02">look down here you can see clearly in</text>
  <text start="703.23" dur="4.8">article one scope of assistance the</text>
  <text start="705.48" dur="3.99">contracting States shall provide mutual</text>

  <text start="715.98" dur="6">proceedings related to criminal matters</text>
  <text start="718.35" dur="6.3">nice so with the same wicked irony as</text>
  <text start="721.98" dur="4.89">the Obama executive order which</text>
  <text start="724.65" dur="4.77">essentially compels President Trump to</text>
  <text start="726.87" dur="5.1">release the FISA we also have this</text>
  <text start="729.42" dur="6.18">treaty with Ukraine which was likely</text>
  <text start="731.97" dur="5.31">used to help cover up knuckleheaded Rhee</text>
  <text start="735.6" dur="4.89">and it looks like at this point it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="737.28" dur="5.52">probably going to expose it ah the irony</text>
  <text start="740.49" dur="5.03">q says these people are stupid and I</text>
  <text start="742.8" dur="6.78">would tend to agree let&amp;#39;s move on</text>

  <text start="776.37" dur="4.17">really kind of just if you don&amp;#39;t follow</text>

  <text start="783.96" dur="3.6">and then we&amp;#39;ll either link you to</text>

  <text start="797.85" dur="4.23">now got their account suspended so I</text>
  <text start="800.55" dur="3.36">think we all see what&amp;#39;s up</text>
  <text start="802.08" dur="3.54">and of course q just talked about this</text>

  <text start="810.63" dur="3.66">really do at this point is essentially</text>
  <text start="811.98" dur="5.1">burn books right just ban people and</text>
  <text start="814.29" dur="4.23">block them and do what not and I&amp;#39;ve been</text>

  <text start="821.58" dur="4.41">possible that we could see a blackout</text>
  <text start="823.35" dur="4.06">here on YouTube I think it&amp;#39;s a probably</text>
  <text start="825.99" dur="3.849">likely to happen that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="829.839" dur="3.24">another platform now would be a really</text>
  <text start="831.279" dur="3.631">good time to do that because it looks</text>
  <text start="833.079" dur="4.171">like they&amp;#39;re banning people simply just</text>
  <text start="834.91" dur="4.169">for retweeting a story how do you</text>
  <text start="837.25" dur="4.47">control the narrative well you just do</text>

  <text start="905.62" dur="8.13">about a quid pro quo anything other than</text>
  <text start="909.339" dur="5.791">her taking quid pro quo of the table I</text>
  <text start="913.75" dur="3.06">think they mean off the table included</text>
  <text start="915.13" dur="4.05">what would say first won&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="916.81" dur="3.719">questions about her actions off the</text>

  <text start="920.529" dur="6.961">here but I want to give you this summary</text>
  <text start="923.829" dur="5.791">here from Jennifer Palmieri first thanks</text>
  <text start="927.49" dur="3.719">to all for the marathon session today I</text>
  <text start="929.62" dur="4.589">thought we got a lot of good work done</text>
  <text start="931.209" dur="5.281">second I wanted to follow up on HRC idea</text>
  <text start="934.209" dur="4.291">of doing the video having thought about</text>
  <text start="936.49" dur="3.719">it and talked to Craig and Mauro about</text>
  <text start="938.5" dur="3.809">it I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a good idea for</text>
  <text start="940.209" dur="4.35">her to do there aren&amp;#39;t great answers and</text>
  <text start="942.309" dur="4.351">in many cases not her place to answer</text>
  <text start="944.559" dur="4.71">them but I think it does make sense for</text>
  <text start="946.66" dur="6.239">her to publicly state that she never did</text>
  <text start="949.269" dur="5.67">anything at state to help a donor Philip</text>
  <text start="952.899" dur="4.68">has been a proponent of this she could</text>
  <text start="954.939" dur="4.741">frame it this way number one very proud</text>
  <text start="957.579" dur="3.221">of Clinton foundation work which already</text>

  <text start="960.8" dur="3.539">can&amp;#39;t imagine even saying that with a</text>
  <text start="962.089" dur="6.141">straight face think people donate to it</text>
  <text start="964.339" dur="7.56">because they want to support good works</text>
  <text start="968.23" dur="5.65">okay if anyone did ever give money in</text>
  <text start="971.899" dur="3.181">hopes of influencing something state did</text>
  <text start="973.88" dur="3.99">which is pretty much the only reason</text>
  <text start="975.08" dur="4.259">people did give money they are foolish</text>
  <text start="977.87" dur="3.209">oh you just call them all foolish</text>
  <text start="979.339" dur="3.87">because she never did that</text>
  <text start="981.079" dur="3.51">and never would and you remember my</text>
  <text start="983.209" dur="4.021">little lie thing I was talking about</text>
  <text start="984.589" dur="5.791">yesterday she never did that and never</text>
  <text start="987.23" dur="5.7">would even though she&amp;#39;s doing it</text>
  <text start="990.38" dur="4.68">SOS makes life-and-death decisions and</text>
  <text start="992.93" dur="3.87">those kinds of political considerations</text>
  <text start="995.06" dur="3.209">don&amp;#39;t come into play at least this way</text>
  <text start="996.8" dur="3">she will have taken off the table any</text>
  <text start="998.269" dur="4.201">notion that there was a quid pro quo</text>
  <text start="999.8" dur="5.159">even if some donors may have had bad</text>
  <text start="1002.47" dur="5.19">intentions and of course many donors had</text>
  <text start="1004.959" dur="5.331">really bad intentions right we saw that</text>
  <text start="1007.66" dur="5.34">from Jeffrey Epstein and a half a Haiti</text>
  <text start="1010.29" dur="5.2">anyway thanks to Lisa Mae Crowley who</text>
  <text start="1013" dur="3.839">over on Twitter late to this article</text>
  <text start="1015.49" dur="2.58">here we&amp;#39;re not gonna cover it but she</text>
  <text start="1016.839" dur="4.981">just wanted to point out this was from</text>
  <text start="1018.07" dur="6.15">NBC here&amp;#39;s the wjc interview referenced</text>
  <text start="1021.82" dur="4.44">in the email from previous drop number</text>
  <text start="1024.22" dur="5.599">seven from this thread notice how he</text>
  <text start="1026.26" dur="5.28">said they never did anything knowingly</text>
  <text start="1029.819" dur="5.081">inappropriate and of course like I said</text>
  <text start="1031.54" dur="6">yesterday also Bill Clinton was a master</text>
  <text start="1034.9" dur="3.99">of using these kinds of words now I said</text>
  <text start="1037.54" dur="3.45">we&amp;#39;re not gonna cover that article but</text>
  <text start="1038.89" dur="3.84">if you are interested in that interview</text>
  <text start="1040.99" dur="3.719">it was essentially when Bill Clinton was</text>
  <text start="1042.73" dur="4.109">defending his decision to take a lot of</text>
  <text start="1044.709" dur="3.511">money from Saudi Arabia was one in</text>
  <text start="1046.839" dur="4.441">particular but you can see right there</text>
  <text start="1048.22" dur="5.01">six Western countries and it looked like</text>
  <text start="1051.28" dur="3.36">Ukraine was probably one of these they</text>
  <text start="1053.23" dur="3.03">were essentially talking about Kenya</text>
  <text start="1054.64" dur="3.69">Nairobi they were talking about their</text>
  <text start="1056.26" dur="4.29">work in Africa and the Clinton Global</text>
  <text start="1058.33" dur="3.69">Initiative which was just essentially</text>
  <text start="1060.55" dur="3.75">another offshoot of this Clinton</text>
  <text start="1062.02" dur="5.13">Foundation you know how that all works Q</text>
  <text start="1064.3" dur="6.27">says read carefully note Podesta&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1067.15" dur="5.82">emails non-public internal so maybe</text>
  <text start="1070.57" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re gonna get some more emails I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1072.97" dur="4.13">really sure that email of course now is</text>
  <text start="1075.01" dur="4.83">public but maybe there are some more</text>
  <text start="1077.1" dur="5.23">fact Ukraine is the single largest</text>
  <text start="1079.84" dur="4.68">Clinton Foundation donor that shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1082.33" dur="4.92">surprise us remember the Podesta group</text>
  <text start="1084.52" dur="5.25">was representing this Bank this spare</text>
  <text start="1087.25" dur="5.13">Bank and essentially representing Viktor</text>
  <text start="1089.77" dur="4.36">Yanukovych in the first place right so</text>
  <text start="1092.38" dur="4.179">the Podesta&amp;#39;s got a little bit of</text>
  <text start="1094.13" dur="4.799">failing to register as a foreign agent</text>
  <text start="1096.559" dur="4.201">that was Tony Podesta and of course John</text>
  <text start="1098.929" dur="3.931">Podesta it was working in the Hillary</text>
  <text start="1100.76" dur="4.47">Clinton campaign but they were also</text>
  <text start="1102.86" dur="5.52">getting money from uranium one right by</text>
  <text start="1105.23" dur="5.55">way of Russia and taking in tons and</text>
  <text start="1108.38" dur="5.37">tons of money I believe it was $900,000</text>
  <text start="1110.78" dur="5.55">from Frank don&amp;#39;t squeeze the juice drah</text>
  <text start="1113.75" dur="7.38">right so sounds like there was a whole</text>
  <text start="1116.33" dur="7.979">lot of quid pro quo shion&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1121.13" dur="6.029">coincidence I think not let&amp;#39;s move on 36</text>
  <text start="1124.309" dur="6.691">12 26 minutes I have to be our a9q says</text>
  <text start="1127.159" dur="7.231">chairman Graham it&amp;#39;s time do it do it</text>
  <text start="1131" dur="5.64">Senate was the target queue indeed said</text>
  <text start="1134.39" dur="3.539">it was the target all along we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1136.64" dur="3.39">really think we were going to be able to</text>
  <text start="1137.929" dur="4.201">grab the house anyway but the reason why</text>
  <text start="1140.03" dur="4.259">the Senate was so important well there</text>
  <text start="1142.13" dur="3.87">were a number of reasons we needed to be</text>
  <text start="1144.289" dur="3.241">able to appoint judges and things like</text>
  <text start="1146" dur="4.32">this because that was really what was</text>
  <text start="1147.53" dur="4.83">going to move us forward at this stage</text>
  <text start="1150.32" dur="3.96">in the game and that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s been so</text>
  <text start="1152.36" dur="4.679">important for President Trump to appoint</text>
  <text start="1154.28" dur="4.32">so many judges and he has now another</text>
  <text start="1157.039" dur="3.181">thing of course was to defend from</text>
  <text start="1158.6" dur="3.54">impeachment because we knew that was</text>
  <text start="1160.22" dur="4.35">going to be step four of their plan</text>
  <text start="1162.14" dur="4.68">right and that&amp;#39;s where we are now also</text>
  <text start="1164.57" dur="4.53">and that of course is falling flat on</text>
  <text start="1166.82" dur="5.07">its face even if they do approve this it</text>
  <text start="1169.1" dur="5.309">is going to die in the Senate but I also</text>
  <text start="1171.89" dur="4.23">think with the calling now we are going</text>
