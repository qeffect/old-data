  <text start="195.05" dur="5.22">the way Trump likes it right acting</text>
  <text start="197.51" dur="4.44">capacity sounds exactly the way he likes</text>
  <text start="200.27" dur="3.99">it but either way it looks like we are</text>
  <text start="201.95" dur="5.01">getting some major housecleaning we get</text>
  <text start="204.26" dur="4.65">some more resignations in 37 19 37</text>
  <text start="206.96" dur="3.9">minutes after the hour of to here is</text>
  <text start="208.91" dur="4.53">part of a statement from the DOJ from</text>
  <text start="210.86" dur="4.41">General William P bar on the departure</text>
  <text start="213.44" dur="4.44">of principal associate Deputy Attorney</text>
  <text start="215.27" dur="3.87">General Edward o Callaghan and the</text>
  <text start="217.88" dur="2.58">statement here is just talking about hey</text>
  <text start="219.14" dur="3.66">thanks for your service you did a great</text>
  <text start="220.46" dur="4.37">job done it a lot I want to point out</text>
  <text start="222.8" dur="5.01">that O&amp;#39;Callahan was the guy who replaced</text>
  <text start="224.83" dur="6.13">Robert Herr Robert who was the guy who</text>
  <text start="227.81" dur="6.09">replaced rod Rosenstein as US attorney</text>
  <text start="230.96" dur="4.5">in Maryland but what I find very curious</text>
  <text start="233.9" dur="3.96">about this is that this guy has worked</text>
  <text start="235.46" dur="5.28">as a prosecutor in the Southern District</text>
  <text start="237.86" dur="4.38">of New York and so much of that is where</text>
  <text start="240.74" dur="3.63">everything is going down with a Hillary</text>
  <text start="242.24" dur="4.47">Clinton laptop of course that&amp;#39;s Giuliani</text>
  <text start="244.37" dur="4.14">territory so much of what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="246.71" dur="4.23">nexium it&amp;#39;s all going down in the</text>
  <text start="248.51" dur="4.86">Southern District of New York so this is</text>
  <text start="250.94" dur="5.13">very curious and a curious resignation I</text>
  <text start="253.37" dur="5.04">don&amp;#39;t know a ton about Edward O&amp;#39;Callahan</text>
  <text start="256.07" dur="4.35">other than that he&amp;#39;s worked in terrorism</text>
  <text start="258.41" dur="4.86">national security he&amp;#39;s also prosecuted a</text>
  <text start="260.42" dur="5.28">lot of Rico prosecutions so my guess</text>
  <text start="263.27" dur="5.43">would be that this guy is wrapped up in</text>
  <text start="265.7" dur="5.07">the minutia of money at some point but I</text>
  <text start="268.7" dur="4.17">found it very curious and then we have</text>
  <text start="270.77" dur="3.66">another one right here this is a link to</text>
  <text start="272.87" dur="3.95">defense news where we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="274.43" dur="4.71">the resignation of the head of DARPA</text>
  <text start="276.82" dur="5.19">interestingly enough this JPEG is</text>
  <text start="279.14" dur="5.52">entitled EMF with which made me think of</text>
  <text start="282.01" dur="5.26">electromagnetic frequencies but QED said</text>
  <text start="284.66" dur="5.94">is still tracking resignations DARPA</text>
  <text start="287.27" dur="5.49">Facebook Q and it takes you here to</text>
  <text start="290.6" dur="4.56">defense news DARPA head resigns moving</text>
  <text start="292.76" dur="4.8">on to industry whatever that means</text>
  <text start="295.16" dur="4.65">Steven Walker the 21st director of the</text>
  <text start="297.56" dur="3.51">US Defense Advanced Research Projects</text>
  <text start="299.81" dur="3.21">Agency</text>
  <text start="301.07" dur="4.98">his resignation on Tuesday which will be</text>
  <text start="303.02" dur="5.43">effective January 10th 2020 defense News</text>
  <text start="306.05" dur="5.19">has learned Walker will move on to a</text>
  <text start="308.45" dur="6.15">position in industry what does that mean</text>
  <text start="311.24" dur="5.64">a position in industry though a DARPA</text>
  <text start="314.6" dur="4.41">spokesman did not reveal where DARPA</text>
  <text start="316.88" dur="3.72">deputy director Peter Heine</text>
  <text start="319.01" dur="4.08">former director of research at the</text>
  <text start="320.6" dur="4.5">National geospatial intelligence agency</text>
  <text start="323.09" dur="4.01">will assume the role of Acting Director</text>
  <text start="325.1" dur="4.11">until a permanent director is appointed</text>
  <text start="327.1" dur="4.27">Hyneman is a former director of the</text>
  <text start="329.21" dur="4.14">Intelligence Advanced Research Projects</text>
  <text start="331.37" dur="3.78">activity so both of these resignations</text>
  <text start="333.35" dur="3.66">are interesting but I want to focus on</text>
  <text start="335.15" dur="4.05">Steven Walker because I find his</text>
  <text start="337.01" dur="4.38">particularly interesting now for those</text>
  <text start="339.2" dur="3.78">of you who don&amp;#39;t know DARPA has been</text>
  <text start="341.39" dur="3.57">around for quite some time and of course</text>
  <text start="342.98" dur="4.14">they do all sorts of CIA clown</text>
  <text start="344.96" dur="4.59">knucklehead projects and it has to do</text>
  <text start="347.12" dur="3.75">with all kinds of crazy technology it</text>
  <text start="349.55" dur="3.99">could be anything from bombs to</text>
  <text start="350.87" dur="4.59">satellites to AI and usually involving</text>
  <text start="353.54" dur="4.02">all of them and kind of mixing it</text>
  <text start="355.46" dur="5.94">together right some pretty creepy stuff</text>
  <text start="357.56" dur="5.88">and of course Facebook was a product of</text>
  <text start="361.4" dur="3.36">DARPA back in the day it was called life</text>
  <text start="363.44" dur="2.61">law I think most of you probably know</text>
  <text start="364.76" dur="3.09">this if you&amp;#39;ve been following my channel</text>
  <text start="366.05" dur="4.44">but if you&amp;#39;re not familiar with this</text>
  <text start="367.85" dur="5.31">this was before Facebook it was known as</text>
  <text start="370.49" dur="4.56">life log and the intent of life log was</text>
  <text start="373.16" dur="3.51">incredibly creepy keep in mind this was</text>
  <text start="375.05" dur="3.78">sort of presented before we really knew</text>
  <text start="376.67" dur="4.23">what social media was but it was</text>
  <text start="378.83" dur="3.87">presenting social media using AI</text>
  <text start="380.9" dur="3.63">learning and then of course even</text>
  <text start="382.7" dur="4.29">creepier technology down the road they</text>
  <text start="384.53" dur="5.19">wanted to use deep dream technology deep</text>
  <text start="386.99" dur="5.43">audio deep fake technology all this kind</text>
  <text start="389.72" dur="4.65">of AI technology that would learn you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="392.42" dur="4.14">thinking spy on youth not only through</text>
  <text start="394.37" dur="5.16">your camera but through the screen of</text>
  <text start="396.56" dur="4.59">your whatever monitor that you&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="399.53" dur="3.24">so this would be able to hear you and</text>
  <text start="401.15" dur="3.21">then eventually using this deep dream</text>
  <text start="402.77" dur="3">technology could even seep into your</text>
  <text start="404.36" dur="3.87">dreams and sort of become this</text>
  <text start="405.77" dur="4.59">essentially a Skynet it really really</text>
  <text start="408.23" dur="4.02">creepy stuff and of course I&amp;#39;m kind of</text>
  <text start="410.36" dur="4.02">oversimplifying for the sake of talking</text>
  <text start="412.25" dur="3.6">off the cuff but you get the idea this</text>
  <text start="414.38" dur="4.29">was really really creepy and of course</text>
  <text start="415.85" dur="4.98">the public didn&amp;#39;t like this very well so</text>
  <text start="418.67" dur="3.87">they pretended to shelve it well days</text>
  <text start="420.83" dur="3.81">later we had Facebook come out on the</text>
  <text start="422.54" dur="3.99">market so we pretty much know the</text>
  <text start="424.64" dur="3.66">connections there we know the Facebook</text>
  <text start="426.53" dur="3.389">has been connected to dark but we know</text>
  <text start="428.3" dur="4.35">that this is just another product of</text>
  <text start="429.919" dur="4.531">DARPA it&amp;#39;s not really a big secret to</text>
  <text start="432.65" dur="3.03">those who have actually cared to look</text>
  <text start="434.45" dur="3.15">but the reason why I find this</text>
  <text start="435.68" dur="4.68">particularly interesting is because this</text>
  <text start="437.6" dur="5.31">guy has been working on a AI program</text>
  <text start="440.36" dur="3.63">called AI next we&amp;#39;re not gonna talk a</text>
  <text start="442.91" dur="3.78">lot about that but there&amp;#39;s some very</text>
  <text start="443.99" dur="4.59">scary implications to this AI next</text>
  <text start="446.69" dur="3.39">program coming out of DARPA but right</text>
  <text start="448.58" dur="5.85">now I&amp;#39;ve got you drawn up to an article</text>
  <text start="450.08" dur="6.78">from February of 2017 DARPA program</text>
  <text start="454.43" dur="5.37">mired in controversy as orbital ATK</text>
  <text start="456.86" dur="4.62">files suit and I&amp;#39;ve talked about this a</text>
  <text start="459.8" dur="4.14">lot actually on my channel you may</text>
  <text start="461.48" dur="5.34">remember this but this is it in regards</text>
  <text start="463.94" dur="4.41">to a robot satellite repair system under</text>
  <text start="466.82" dur="3.12">development by DARPA has drawn the</text>
  <text start="468.35" dur="4.05">baleful glances of half a dozen</text>
  <text start="469.94" dur="6.15">congressmen and a lawsuit to block it by</text>
  <text start="472.4" dur="6.21">aerospace company orbit orbital ATK the</text>
  <text start="476.09" dur="4.68">technology known as robotic servicing of</text>
  <text start="478.61" dur="4.08">geosynchronous satellites would offer</text>
  <text start="480.77" dur="4.11">enormous benefits to both the National</text>
  <text start="482.69" dur="4.17">Reconnaissance Office operator of our</text>
  <text start="484.88" dur="3.69">spy satellites as well as the</text>
  <text start="486.86" dur="3.72">international commercial satellite</text>
  <text start="488.57" dur="2.76">companies such as insula Intel SATs</text>
  <text start="490.58" dur="3.99">excuse me</text>
  <text start="491.33" dur="6.27">why because using our SGS satellites in</text>
  <text start="494.57" dur="4.92">geosynchronous orbit 22,000 miles up</text>
  <text start="497.6" dur="4.89">could be checked for problems repaired</text>
  <text start="499.49" dur="5.25">and even get new sensors installed today</text>
  <text start="502.49" dur="4.89">the school bus size spy satellites built</text>
  <text start="504.74" dur="4.05">and run by the NRO and the commercial</text>
  <text start="507.38" dur="3.42">satellites have to be built to withstand</text>
  <text start="508.79" dur="3.42">the rigors of space if something goes</text>
  <text start="510.8" dur="2.97">wrong it can be very difficult to tell</text>
  <text start="512.21" dur="3.9">the cause let alone fix it and here&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="513.77" dur="4.92">picture of Steven Walker here the</text>
  <text start="516.11" dur="4.17">problem is that orbital ATK is building</text>
  <text start="518.69" dur="4.26">the system it believes competes directly</text>
  <text start="520.28" dur="4.38">with the DARPA initiative which would be</text>
  <text start="522.95" dur="4.14">a violation of US National Space policy</text>
  <text start="524.66" dur="4.71">the policy requires that the government</text>
  <text start="527.09" dur="4.65">not build or buy systems that preclude</text>
  <text start="529.37" dur="5.7">discourage or compete with commercial</text>
  <text start="531.74" dur="5.76">systems okay so this was back in 2017</text>
  <text start="535.07" dur="4.8">and these orbital satellites his</text>
  <text start="537.5" dur="4.32">bus-sized satellites we talked a lot</text>
  <text start="539.87" dur="5.25">before they&amp;#39;re part of a series that q</text>
  <text start="541.82" dur="6.3">is also mentioned back here in post 2:16</text>
  <text start="545.12" dur="6.42">and this was back in November of 2017</text>
  <text start="548.12" dur="5.76">where Q just simply said keyhole happy</text>
  <text start="551.54" dur="4.44">hunting q well I&amp;#39;ve talked extensively</text>
  <text start="553.88" dur="4.26">about these keyhole series</text>
  <text start="555.98" dur="3.54">satellites these were spy satellites and</text>
  <text start="558.14" dur="4.08">I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of different theories in</text>
  <text start="559.52" dur="3.87">regards to this I know some of you Tech</text>
  <text start="562.22" dur="3.63">guys were probably gonna jump down my</text>
  <text start="563.39" dur="4.15">throat for talking off the cuff here but</text>
  <text start="565.85" dur="3.7">this was in regards to a whole</text>
  <text start="567.54" dur="3.81">series of keyhole satellites and they</text>
  <text start="569.55" dur="5.07">had interesting names that q is also</text>
  <text start="571.35" dur="5.82">mentioned q as mentioned a Big Bird</text>
  <text start="574.62" dur="5.579">which was the KH 9 hexagon that was the</text>
  <text start="577.17" dur="6.87">Big Bird satellite we had the kh7 gamut</text>
  <text start="580.199" dur="6.421">and the argon kh5 and then of course the</text>
  <text start="584.04" dur="4.859">KH 10 I believe it was was actually</text>
  <text start="586.62" dur="4.35">called durian and if you&amp;#39;ll remember we</text>
  <text start="588.899" dur="4.981">had hurricane durian just recently and</text>
  <text start="590.97" dur="4.47">if you go to my video entitled durian</text>
  <text start="593.88" dur="3.75">you will see how this connects with the</text>
  <text start="595.44" dur="4.139">spy satellites but these satellites have</text>

  <text start="603.54" dur="5.07">kept resurfacing here and the tech that</text>
  <text start="606.75" dur="3.99">this Steven Walker has involved in is</text>
  <text start="608.61" dur="5.07">the tech that goes up there and actually</text>
  <text start="610.74" dur="5.849">goes and fixes these MO LS which means</text>
  <text start="613.68" dur="4.469">like mobile orbital laboratory right so</text>
  <text start="616.589" dur="3.721">this is really interesting stuff and</text>
  <text start="618.149" dur="3.391">these were used as spy satellites now it</text>
  <text start="620.31" dur="2.85">doesn&amp;#39;t seem like they were always being</text>
  <text start="621.54" dur="4.02">used for good</text>
  <text start="623.16" dur="5.13">but we do see references here to Q if</text>
  <text start="625.56" dur="5.43">you will remember all these corona posts</text>
  <text start="628.29" dur="5.669">right here this is 2013 or excuse me</text>

  <text start="652.62" dur="4.17">what the Snow White is in reference to</text>
  <text start="654.51" dur="5.37">but it looked like these were all being</text>
  <text start="656.79" dur="5.039">taken down and in this same series we</text>
  <text start="659.88" dur="3.569">ended up seeing a reference to the big</text>

  <text start="663.449" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;re talking about these keyhole</text>
  <text start="664.94" dur="5.019">satellites and here this guy Steven</text>
  <text start="667.019" dur="4.591">Walker seemed to be directly involved</text>
  <text start="669.959" dur="3.271">with these now I have long suspected</text>
  <text start="671.61" dur="3.39">that some of this technology was being</text>

  <text start="685.62" dur="4.55">been very very suspect of this and Q has</text>
  <text start="688.439" dur="4.441">obviously mentioned it quite a few times</text>
  <text start="690.17" dur="4.839">so it wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise me if Steven</text>
  <text start="692.88" dur="4.439">Walker had something to do with all of</text>
  <text start="695.009" dur="4.531">this and maybe that&amp;#39;s why what has led</text>
