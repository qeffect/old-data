  <text start="58.86" dur="4.77">another drive-by shooting pop-pop-pop</text>
  <text start="61.08" dur="3.93">pop-pop-pop good lord q or not on each</text>
  <text start="63.63" dur="4.05">hand trying to catch up with you here</text>
  <text start="65.01" dur="6.6">let&amp;#39;s start you off where we last left</text>
  <text start="67.68" dur="6.33">you which is 33 85 37 minutes out to the</text>
  <text start="71.61" dur="4.38">hour of 11 didn&amp;#39;t think the Epstein</text>
  <text start="74.01" dur="4.23">investigation began a few months ago did</text>
  <text start="75.99" dur="3.87">you know and we shouldn&amp;#39;t have it was</text>
  <text start="78.24" dur="3.06">actually just a couple of months ago we</text>
  <text start="79.86" dur="3.36">were talking about the possibility of</text>
  <text start="81.3" dur="3.929">these new indictments even being allowed</text>
  <text start="83.22" dur="3.93">in and that was going to depend on the</text>
  <text start="85.229" dur="3.181">judge of course we talked about it on</text>
  <text start="87.15" dur="3.39">this channel so we knew that it was a</text>
  <text start="88.41" dur="3.599">possibility and of course we knew this</text>
  <text start="90.54" dur="4.439">investigation was going on for quite</text>
  <text start="92.009" dur="5.131">some time and this was all because of</text>
  <text start="94.979" dur="4.051">Jeff Sessions and we talked about that</text>
  <text start="97.14" dur="3.3">yesterday to a Jeff Sessions well he</text>
  <text start="99.03" dur="3.09">took a lot of arrows for people saying</text>
  <text start="100.44" dur="3.03">he wasn&amp;#39;t doing anything all these</text>
  <text start="102.12" dur="3.81">things that we were watching q talk</text>
  <text start="103.47" dur="5.34">about the entire cleaning out of the top</text>
  <text start="105.93" dur="4.47">to bottom of the FBI of DOJ that was all</text>
  <text start="108.81" dur="3.3">getting signed off by Jeff Sessions</text>
  <text start="110.4" dur="4.08">right Jeff Sessions was well aware of</text>
  <text start="112.11" dur="4.5">this just because Jeff Sessions recused</text>
  <text start="114.48" dur="3.84">himself people wanted to treat him like</text>
  <text start="116.61" dur="3.78">a stooge but the fact of the matter is</text>
  <text start="118.32" dur="4.62">is that the only thing that Jeff</text>
  <text start="120.39" dur="5.16">Sessions accused recused himself of was</text>
  <text start="122.94" dur="5.37">the Trump Russia collusion investigation</text>
  <text start="125.55" dur="5.04">which makes a lot of sense so now that</text>
  <text start="128.31" dur="3.66">we have a little bit of a hindsight with</text>
  <text start="130.59" dur="4.17">this this should make sense now</text>
  <text start="131.97" dur="6.66">obviously what really began this was</text>
  <text start="134.76" dur="5.91">this December 7 2017 executive order</text>
  <text start="138.63" dur="3.93">blocking the property of persons</text>
  <text start="140.67" dur="4.98">involved in serious human rights abuse</text>
  <text start="142.56" dur="4.92">or corruption and at the time this was Q</text>
  <text start="145.65" dur="2.85">what Q had said was their Christmas</text>
  <text start="147.48" dur="3.87">present to us right</text>
  <text start="148.5" dur="4.95">well human rights abuse and corruption</text>
  <text start="151.35" dur="3.449">is a very very kind of general term it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="153.45" dur="3.45">a wide scoping</text>
  <text start="154.799" dur="3.72">terminology and but really what it comes</text>
  <text start="156.9" dur="3.36">down to is that this takes away the</text>
  <text start="158.519" dur="3.351">funding of a lot of these organizations</text>
  <text start="160.26" dur="4.289">that we&amp;#39;ve talked about for so long</text>
  <text start="161.87" dur="5.44">whether it is some sort of quote-unquote</text>
  <text start="164.549" dur="4.141">human rights organization oddly enough</text>
  <text start="167.31" dur="3.84">what they use right using their own</text>
  <text start="168.69" dur="3.78">projection to declare themselves a human</text>
  <text start="171.15" dur="3.12">rights organization with the fact of the</text>
  <text start="172.47" dur="4.83">matter is that the just slush fund and</text>
  <text start="174.27" dur="5.07">money into a whole bunch of projects</text>
  <text start="177.3" dur="4.8">like Jeffrey Epstein&amp;#39;s little island and</text>
  <text start="179.34" dur="4.399">tunnels underneath LA and all the kind</text>
  <text start="182.1" dur="4.469">of stuff that the deep state wants to do</text>
  <text start="183.739" dur="5.021">this was done on an even bigger scale in</text>
  <text start="186.569" dur="4.201">Iran but I don&amp;#39;t want to get into all</text>
  <text start="188.76" dur="4.11">that but anyway this was the start of it</text>
  <text start="190.77" dur="3.63">right and then we had this here and I</text>
  <text start="192.87" dur="2.97">want to thank Lisa made Crowley for</text>
  <text start="194.4" dur="2.7">pulling this out because I was gonna try</text>
  <text start="195.84" dur="3.75">and find the video and this is just</text>
  <text start="197.1" dur="4.53">easier to remember eyes you with but</text>
  <text start="199.59" dur="3.51">this was a speech that general attorney</text>
  <text start="201.63" dur="4.8">general jeff sessions made in February</text>
  <text start="203.1" dur="6.3">of 2018 and I just want to take you down</text>
  <text start="206.43" dur="5.61">to part of it right here in the middle</text>

  <text start="233.549" dur="3.181">valuable member of one of these teams</text>
  <text start="235.23" dur="3.509">and he will be presenting today on some</text>
  <text start="236.73" dur="4.65">of the successes that he has had in his</text>
  <text start="238.739" dur="4.111">district remember this was a speech so</text>
  <text start="241.38" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;ve caught a note about this if we</text>
  <text start="242.85" dur="4.109">were paying attention but outwardly in</text>
  <text start="245.16" dur="3.03">the news Jeff Sessions was getting</text>
  <text start="246.959" dur="3.151">clowned everybody was saying that he</text>
  <text start="248.19" dur="4.23">wasn&amp;#39;t up to much at all well the fact</text>
  <text start="250.11" dur="4.83">of the matter is that just wasn&amp;#39;t true q</text>
  <text start="252.42" dur="5.249">says expect a lot more to become public</text>
  <text start="254.94" dur="4.979">and sealing and I would assume that is</text>
  <text start="257.669" dur="6.601">unsealing of indictments and whatnot so</text>
  <text start="259.919" dur="6.991">very exciting times let&amp;#39;s move on q adds</text>
  <text start="264.27" dur="5.399">on and post 33 86 42 minutes after the</text>
  <text start="266.91" dur="4.53">hour of 11:00 bar not recused from I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="279.89" dur="3.85">simple all right well there&amp;#39;s a lot to</text>
  <text start="281.91" dur="3.06">unpack here and this is pretty important</text>
  <text start="283.74" dur="4.92">to understand because it&amp;#39;s a little bit</text>
  <text start="284.97" dur="5.37">confusing but bar has actually recuse</text>
  <text start="288.66" dur="3.03">himself from something recently and</text>
  <text start="290.34" dur="5.61">let&amp;#39;s clarify that I&amp;#39;m over here on</text>
  <text start="291.69" dur="6.599">Forbes and let&amp;#39;s take you right here bar</text>
  <text start="295.95" dur="4.7">has said he will recuse himself from a</text>
  <text start="298.289" dur="5.211">probe of Secretary of Labor Alexandre</text>
  <text start="300.65" dur="5.489">costas role in Epstein&amp;#39;s 2008 highly</text>
  <text start="303.5" dur="5.04">controversial plea deal in Florida that</text>
  <text start="306.139" dur="4.291">was Epstein&amp;#39;s a plea deal and remember</text>
  <text start="308.54" dur="3.48">he probably rolled over on quite a few</text>
  <text start="310.43" dur="4.17">people that&amp;#39;s why he got the lenient</text>
  <text start="312.02" dur="4.32">sentence that he did now that was a</text>
  <text start="314.6" dur="4.74">suspicious plea deal and that might open</text>
  <text start="316.34" dur="4.859">up some new things too but bar will not</text>
  <text start="319.34" dur="3.54">be a part of that because he&amp;#39;s recused</text>
  <text start="321.199" dur="3.631">himself from that now these new</text>
  <text start="322.88" dur="4.379">indictments that we&amp;#39;ve got have nothing</text>
  <text start="324.83" dur="4.459">to do with bar but really what the</text>
  <text start="327.259" dur="4.5">Democrats are fighting about is this</text>
  <text start="329.289" dur="4.421">former FBI assistant director Frank</text>
  <text start="331.759" dur="4.501">figlio as he tweeted Sunday that bars</text>
  <text start="333.71" dur="4.95">father hired Epstein in the 70s to teach</text>
  <text start="336.26" dur="4.05">mathematics at Manhattan&amp;#39;s prestigious</text>
  <text start="338.66" dur="4.56">Dalton school and as far as I know that</text>
  <text start="340.31" dur="4.44">is true so they&amp;#39;re not wrong and Barr</text>
  <text start="343.22" dur="3.419">previously worked for Kirkland and Ellis</text>
  <text start="344.75" dur="3.63">a law firm that represented Epstein</text>
  <text start="346.639" dur="4.321">during the Florida investigation also</text>
  <text start="348.38" dur="5.219">true so you can see what they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="350.96" dur="4.29">about here and I want to just insert</text>
  <text start="353.599" dur="3.561">this here and please understand me for</text>
  <text start="355.25" dur="5.19">the whole of what I&amp;#39;m trying to say I</text>
  <text start="357.16" dur="5.71">have said this before initially during</text>
  <text start="360.44" dur="6.87">bars the initial appointment I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="362.87" dur="6.63">100% sold on a G bar and his past he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="367.31" dur="4.68">had a very interesting past involving</text>
  <text start="369.5" dur="5.19">South America some guns and some drug</text>
  <text start="371.99" dur="4.41">running at the table now I am NOT saying</text>
  <text start="374.69" dur="3.3">that bars a black guy I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="376.4" dur="4.38">he&amp;#39;s white hat what I am saying is that</text>
  <text start="377.99" dur="5.91">in this complex situation there is such</text>
  <text start="380.78" dur="4.71">a wide area of gray in here that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="383.9" dur="4.079">really really hard to know and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="385.49" dur="4.26">know all I want to do is point out what</text>
  <text start="387.979" dur="4.141">the facts are about bar</text>
  <text start="389.75" dur="3.72">now just because bar was involved in</text>
  <text start="392.12" dur="3.6">some gnarly stuff back in the day</text>
  <text start="393.47" dur="4.22">doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean that his</text>
  <text start="395.72" dur="4.86">efforts aren&amp;#39;t virtuous at the point</text>
  <text start="397.69" dur="5.44">remember Q has also said that about 70</text>
  <text start="400.58" dur="3.99">percent of the whole crew was involved</text>
  <text start="403.13" dur="3.69">and a lot of people are going to get</text>
  <text start="404.57" dur="4.529">deals and cooperate in different ways</text>
  <text start="406.82" dur="4.349">maybe bars way of cooperating and making</text>
  <text start="409.099" dur="4.44">amends is going through this whole</text>
  <text start="411.169" dur="4.261">process and maybe I&amp;#39;m completely wrong</text>
  <text start="413.539" dur="4.741">all about it but I do want to point out</text>
  <text start="415.43" dur="4.35">that these things are true and that bar</text>
  <text start="418.28" dur="3.6">did have a little bit of a shady past</text>
  <text start="419.78" dur="3.3">now just because you ran some guns and</text>
  <text start="421.88" dur="2.31">drugs back in the day doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="423.08" dur="3.75">necessarily mean that you&amp;#39;re diddling</text>
  <text start="424.19" dur="4.529">kids on the island right there&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="426.83" dur="2.88">big difference of that and I think that</text>
  <text start="428.719" dur="2.551">that&amp;#39;s what a lot what we&amp;#39;re dealing</text>
  <text start="429.71" dur="3.269">with so I don&amp;#39;t want to get way into</text>
  <text start="431.27" dur="3.24">that kind of minutiae cuz everyone is</text>
  <text start="432.979" dur="2.821">free to feel the way that they do but</text>
  <text start="434.51" dur="2.52">do you want to point out that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="435.8" dur="3.48">what the Democrats are going to be</text>
  <text start="437.03" dur="4.71">arguing about but bar is not gonna be</text>
  <text start="439.28" dur="3.9">recusing himself from these new these</text>
  <text start="441.74" dur="2.43">new indictments and that&amp;#39;s a really</text>
  <text start="443.18" dur="2.37">important thing and of course that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="444.17" dur="2.22">what sparking the liberal outrage</text>
  <text start="445.55" dur="2.79">because they want to make that</text>
  <text start="446.39" dur="4.02">connection now how it&amp;#39;s all gonna work</text>
  <text start="448.34" dur="4.5">out I don&amp;#39;t really know maybe I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="450.41" dur="3.78">the whole scenario Rome and as far as I</text>
  <text start="452.84" dur="4.59">remember that&amp;#39;s how it all worked out</text>
  <text start="454.19" dur="4.65">Hugh says counter made simple so I think</text>
  <text start="457.43" dur="2.76">it&amp;#39;s gonna work out I do think Bart&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.84" dur="3.39">gonna stick with this I do think he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.19" dur="3.45">going to prosecute regardless of his</text>
  <text start="462.23" dur="3.66">past I do think he&amp;#39;s got to do the right</text>
  <text start="463.64" dur="3.93">thing here and I&amp;#39;m pretty excited to see</text>
  <text start="465.89" dur="2.67">how this works out but I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="467.57" dur="2.76">gonna be a no-go</text>
  <text start="468.56" dur="3.18">q says counter made simple we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="470.33" dur="3.3">see how this plays out</text>
  <text start="471.74" dur="3.9">now for a little bit more insight I want</text>
  <text start="473.63" dur="3.84">to turn you on to this Fox vo and</text>
  <text start="475.64" dur="3.69">attorney David Bruno&amp;#39;s got some pretty</text>
  <text start="477.47" dur="3.87">clever things to say about this check it</text>
  <text start="479.33" dur="5.61">out how serious are these charges</text>
  <text start="481.34" dur="5.43">against Epstein David Oh huge I mean</text>
  <text start="484.94" dur="4.29">he&amp;#39;s exposed to life on these sex</text>
  <text start="486.77" dur="5.46">trafficking cases now let&amp;#39;s just talk</text>
  <text start="489.23" dur="5.72">how this came about because back about a</text>
  <text start="492.23" dur="6.21">decade ago he resolved his cases in</text>
  <text start="494.95" dur="5.37">Florida on state crimes and he signed a</text>
  <text start="498.44" dur="5.1">non-prosecution agreement with the feds</text>
  <text start="500.32" dur="5.26">now just this this year that</text>
  <text start="503.54" dur="5.04">non-prosecution agreement was found to</text>
  <text start="505.58" dur="5.04">be violating federal law which opens the</text>
  <text start="508.58" dur="4.05">door to these new charges and because</text>
  <text start="510.62" dur="4.44">sex trafficking doesn&amp;#39;t have a statute</text>
  <text start="512.63" dur="3.78">of limitations New York has now brought</text>
  <text start="515.06" dur="3.72">these charges against them and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="516.41" dur="3.93">exposed to life in prison as a former</text>
  <text start="518.78" dur="3.569">assistant US attorney Alex are you</text>
  <text start="520.34" dur="3.93">convinced the feds must have the goods</text>
  <text start="522.349" dur="3.811">on Epstein well look the Southern</text>
  <text start="524.27" dur="3.72">District of New York is a very very</text>
  <text start="526.16" dur="3.09">capable office there you know well known</text>
  <text start="527.99" dur="2.82">as some of the best prosecutors in the</text>
  <text start="529.25" dur="3.72">country so they clearly have what they</text>
  <text start="530.81" dur="3.78">believe is a strong case there are a lot</text>
  <text start="532.97" dur="3.81">of complications in this case it took</text>
  <text start="534.59" dur="4.2">place a long time ago the the conduct at</text>
  <text start="536.78" dur="4.5">issue and there is this deal hanging out</text>

  <text start="541.28" dur="3.99">signed when he was the US Attorney down</text>
  <text start="542.99" dur="4.44">in Miami which could absolutely lead to</text>
  <text start="545.27" dur="3.48">some complications down the road and his</text>
  <text start="547.43" dur="2.55">defense team Epstein&amp;#39;s gonna it was a</text>

  <text start="555.71" dur="3.96">steps in this case David yeah he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="558.26" dur="3.33">be arraigned he&amp;#39;s gonna go before a</text>
  <text start="559.67" dur="3.24">magistrate and the judge is gonna</text>
  <text start="561.59" dur="4.2">determine whether or not he&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="562.91" dur="4.17">released with conditions thereafter the</text>
  <text start="565.79" dur="2.4">prosecutor will have to provide</text>
  <text start="567.08" dur="2.88">discovery</text>
  <text start="568.19" dur="3.27">and Epstein is teams gonna have to make</text>
  <text start="569.96" dur="3.9">the decision whether or not to plead</text>
  <text start="571.46" dur="3.69">guilty whether or not to go to trial and</text>
  <text start="573.86" dur="3.93">I think the most interesting thing that</text>
  <text start="575.15" dur="5.16">pops to me is is Epstein going to</text>
  <text start="577.79" dur="3.51">cooperate because back in the day when</text>
  <text start="580.31" dur="4.14">he signed that non-prosecution agreement</text>
  <text start="581.3" dur="5.4">and also protected co-conspirators so if</text>
  <text start="584.45" dur="4.29">if he&amp;#39;s looking at life in prison now</text>
  <text start="586.7" dur="4.14">may be the time to roll over on people</text>
  <text start="588.74" dur="4.32">and who knows what type of people may be</text>
  <text start="590.84" dur="3.66">involved in this conspiracy great point</text>
  <text start="593.06" dur="3.45">this guy&amp;#39;s a billionaire with a lot of</text>
  <text start="594.5" dur="3.78">wealthy and high-profile friends should</text>
  <text start="596.51" dur="3.23">those people be worried about Epstein</text>
  <text start="598.28" dur="3.27">taking them down with him Alex</text>
  <text start="599.74" dur="3.52">absolutely what&amp;#39;s really interesting</text>
  <text start="601.55" dur="5.25">about this is it&amp;#39;s being done by the</text>
  <text start="603.26" dur="5.52">public prosecution unit in New York so</text>
  <text start="606.8" dur="4.35">these are folks who generally do props</text>
  <text start="608.78" dur="4.26">and crimes do economic crimes and so</text>
  <text start="611.15" dur="3.3">they are very well adept at flipping</text>
  <text start="613.04" dur="3.27">people like this against folks sort of</text>
  <text start="614.45" dur="3.63">higher up the food chain Epstein has</text>
  <text start="616.31" dur="3">really famous friends he&amp;#39;s hung out both</text>
  <text start="618.08" dur="3.27">the current president Trump and the</text>
  <text start="619.31" dur="3.84">former President Bill Clinton and so if</text>
  <text start="621.35" dur="3.15">you&amp;#39;re in his orbit and you were doing</text>
  <text start="623.15" dur="3.21">things that you shouldn&amp;#39;t have back in</text>
  <text start="624.5" dur="4.02">the early 2000s you ought to be very</text>
  <text start="626.36" dur="4.05">very concerned right now does sex</text>
  <text start="628.52" dur="4.56">trafficking which is the charge require</text>
  <text start="630.41" dur="4.85">other people so David would you expect</text>
  <text start="633.08" dur="5.79">the feds to be looking for alleged</text>
  <text start="635.26" dur="4.18">co-conspirators yes absolutely the Miami</text>
  <text start="638.87" dur="3">Herald</text>
  <text start="639.44" dur="4.56">they came out and they had a very</text>
  <text start="641.87" dur="3.9">comprehensive report and there are</text>
  <text start="644" dur="4.38">co-conspirators that are mentioned in</text>
  <text start="645.77" dur="4.59">the report so if that report is true</text>
  <text start="648.38" dur="7.98">there are many that have to worry about</text>
  <text start="650.36" dur="8.01">cooperation by Epstein okay so that okay</text>
  <text start="656.36" dur="4.14">so it was a little bit long but I think</text>
  <text start="658.37" dur="5.16">it was worth hearing and that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="660.5" dur="4.8">why we see here Christine Pelosi talking</text>
  <text start="663.53" dur="3.84">the way she&amp;#39;s talking this Epstein case</text>
  <text start="665.3" dur="3.9">is horrific and the young women deserve</text>
  <text start="667.37" dur="3.63">justice it is quite likely that some of</text>
  <text start="669.2" dur="3.51">our faves are implicated but we must</text>
  <text start="671" dur="3.75">follow the fact and let the chips fall</text>
  <text start="672.71" dur="5.61">where they may whether on Republicans or</text>
  <text start="674.75" dur="4.89">Democrats so we don&amp;#39;t really know and I</text>
  <text start="678.32" dur="2.85">think that it&amp;#39;s going to involve a lot</text>
  <text start="679.64" dur="3.78">of Republicans too it&amp;#39;s gonna involve a</text>
  <text start="681.17" dur="4.59">lot of people you&amp;#39;ve seen the logs this</text>
  <text start="683.42" dur="4.89">has a ton of implications and it spreads</text>
  <text start="685.76" dur="3.96">far and wide and now that we truly</text>
  <text start="688.31" dur="3.15">understand this we can really really</text>
  <text start="689.72" dur="3.45">understand why these celebrities are</text>
  <text start="691.46" dur="4.11">railing against Trump the way they are</text>
  <text start="693.17" dur="4.06">from Madonna the Bette Midler to Rob</text>
  <text start="695.57" dur="4.03">Reiner to whom</text>
  <text start="697.23" dur="4.74">right these people are freaked out for</text>
  <text start="699.6" dur="5.19">very very good reasons because this went</text>
  <text start="701.97" dur="4.86">far and why and you know Christine</text>
  <text start="704.79" dur="3.78">Pelosi is obviously gonna try and shape</text>
  <text start="706.83" dur="3.96">the narrative so that we start looking</text>
  <text start="708.57" dur="3.75">the Republicans way but to be fair there</text>
  <text start="710.79" dur="3.09">probably are a lot of Republicans that</text>
  <text start="712.32" dur="3.75">are going to be implicated we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="713.88" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s gonna be a lot of folks but we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="716.07" dur="4.29">got the logs right and while we&amp;#39;re at it</text>
  <text start="718.32" dur="3.9">let&amp;#39;s remember what else Christine blows</text>
  <text start="720.36" dur="5.13">he said she&amp;#39;ll cut your head off and you</text>
  <text start="722.22" dur="6.39">won&amp;#39;t even know you&amp;#39;re bleeding no let&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="931.64" dur="3.48">bit on Andrew Weissman so the American</text>
  <text start="933.62" dur="4.83">people know who he is</text>

  <text start="943.4" dur="6.06">Wiseman the poster boy for prosecutorial</text>

  <text start="952.25" dur="5.22">Enron task force and appointing him to</text>

  <text start="957.47" dur="4.41">time Muller was in the FBI at the time</text>
  <text start="959.69" dur="4.91">the director of the FBI yes they fix</text>
  <text start="961.88" dur="4.95">Weissman to handle the Enron case yes</text>
  <text start="964.6" dur="4.3">Wiseman was a deputy director at the</text>
  <text start="966.83" dur="4.08">time when they first started under</text>
  <text start="968.9" dur="3.75">Leslie Caldwell who was the chief of the</text>
  <text start="970.91" dur="6.03">Enron task force when it was first</text>
  <text start="972.65" dur="6.72">created in the collapse of Enron so they</text>
  <text start="976.94" dur="4.68">said about and targeted Arthur Andersen</text>
  <text start="979.37" dur="4.74">to begin with the venerable accounting</text>
  <text start="981.62" dur="5.31">firm so they&amp;#39;re investigating Enron yes</text>
  <text start="984.11" dur="6.03">and they target Arthur Andersen yes or</text>
  <text start="986.93" dur="6.03">what for destroying evidence it&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="990.14" dur="5.37">they called it but they did it by making</text>
  <text start="992.96" dur="4.5">up a crime by combining two separate</text>
  <text start="995.51" dur="4.32">statutes to create a crime out of</text>
  <text start="997.46" dur="4.38">something that wasn&amp;#39;t alrighty then so</text>
  <text start="999.83" dur="4.17">we see ourselves a little pattern with</text>
  <text start="1001.84" dur="3.57">Weisman and Muller right this isn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="1004" dur="4.11">first time they&amp;#39;ve been up to their</text>
  <text start="1005.41" dur="4.41">little knuckleheaded Rhee and I believe</text>
  <text start="1008.11" dur="3.39">this is likely why they hired Sidney</text>
  <text start="1009.82" dur="3.57">Powell because not only does she know</text>
  <text start="1011.5" dur="3.72">about it she directly knows about it</text>
  <text start="1013.39" dur="4.74">that would be my guess when Q says there</text>
  <text start="1015.22" dur="5.01">is a big direct reason cuz she can not</text>
  <text start="1018.13" dur="3.84">only pick this apart but she could</text>
  <text start="1020.23" dur="3.84">personally probably destroy the</text>

  <text start="1026.11" dur="4.44">more question to this Muller report but</text>
  <text start="1029.17" dur="2.82">my guess is that she would be seeking</text>
  <text start="1030.55" dur="3.36">security clearance such that she can get</text>
  <text start="1031.99" dur="4.02">some access to some of those redacted</text>

  <text start="1036.01" dur="4.11">likely</text>

  <text start="1077.6" dur="4.35">why did Rodgers retire well I&amp;#39;m not so</text>

  <text start="1133.46" dur="3.089">he gave up the info to POTUS he was</text>
  <text start="1135.14" dur="3.389">probably gonna have to get on a picture</text>
  <text start="1136.549" dur="4.23">that would be my guess but we&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="1138.529" dur="4.02">about him in just a second why did POTUS</text>

  <text start="1159.409" dur="4.89">a Devin Nunez and my guess is is that</text>
  <text start="1161.75" dur="4.529">Devin Nunez was informed by somebody who</text>
  <text start="1164.299" dur="4.801">had originally worked with Flynn and</text>
  <text start="1166.279" dur="4.681">remember this name we&amp;#39;ve talked about it</text>

  <text start="1199.2" dur="2.73">knew they were being bugged they needed</text>
  <text start="1200.52" dur="3.54">they knew they needed to move out and</text>
  <text start="1201.93" dur="4.65">that&amp;#39;s when the ABC directors realized</text>
  <text start="1204.06" dur="4.53">that Rodgers wasn&amp;#39;t on their side and so</text>
  <text start="1206.58" dur="3.6">of course he was gonna have to go likely</text>
  <text start="1208.59" dur="4.56">for his own safety</text>
  <text start="1210.18" dur="4.62">now Rodgers has found himself into a new</text>

  <text start="2717.83" dur="3.57">really tell this looks to be a woman</text>
  <text start="2719.48" dur="4.47">right here I honest and then there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2721.4" dur="4.38">whole bunch of people in this room it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2723.95" dur="3.15">kind of hard to tell I&amp;#39;m not really good</text>
  <text start="2725.78" dur="2.82">at breaking down these pictures or</text>
  <text start="2727.1" dur="5.19">whatever but this is what we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="2728.6" dur="6.69">about the anon says 16 channels 4x4 and</text>
  <text start="2732.29" dur="7.56">cue says no 2013 on the bottom date</text>
  <text start="2735.29" dur="5.88">important yets July 19th 2013 so why is</text>
  <text start="2739.85" dur="3.33">it important why I imagine it has</text>
  <text start="2741.17" dur="5.25">something to do with the epstein flight</text>
  <text start="2743.18" dur="6.69">logs right now I don&amp;#39;t know if this is</text>
  <text start="2746.42" dur="6.06">why Q has mentioned Bill Maher if Bill</text>
  <text start="2749.87" dur="5.31">Maher is part of this but I imagine it</text>
  <text start="2752.48" dur="4.62">has to do with these July 19 2013 flight</text>
  <text start="2755.18" dur="3.33">logs now I&amp;#39;ve kind of pored over I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="2757.1" dur="2.58">little bit I haven&amp;#39;t found much but do</text>
  <text start="2758.51" dur="2.25">you want to point something out and</text>
  <text start="2759.68" dur="3.57">although I don&amp;#39;t think that Q is</text>
  <text start="2760.76" dur="4.67">directly referring to this person right</text>
  <text start="2763.25" dur="5.61">now about Howard Goodman</text>
  <text start="2765.43" dur="6.31">he was the ambassador of Belgium back</text>
  <text start="2768.86" dur="6.03">then in 2013 there was a State</text>
  <text start="2771.74" dur="5.49">Department whistleblower that said that</text>
  <text start="2774.89" dur="5.16">he was soliciting underage prostitutes</text>
  <text start="2777.23" dur="5.04">and it was just starting to become a big</text>
  <text start="2780.05" dur="3.63">deal and then all sudden it was John</text>
  <text start="2782.27" dur="4.68">Kerry was Secretary of State at the time</text>
  <text start="2783.68" dur="5.49">it was Patrick Kenny Kennedy under his</text>
  <text start="2786.95" dur="4.38">office was the one who actually kind of</text>
  <text start="2789.17" dur="5.52">squashed the whole thing Patrick Kennedy</text>
  <text start="2791.33" dur="5.16">so I would imagine that maybe Howard</text>
  <text start="2794.69" dur="3.48">Goodman could be part of this I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2796.49" dur="3.24">think that this is necessarily going</text>
  <text start="2798.17" dur="4.89">straight to Howard Goodman but he was</text>
  <text start="2799.73" dur="5.1">accused of this in 2013 but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2803.06" dur="3.51">wondering if the mentions of Bill Moore</text>
  <text start="2804.83" dur="3.75">or maybe what Q is getting at but either</text>
  <text start="2806.57" dur="4.05">way it likely has something to do with</text>
  <text start="2808.58" dur="4.11">the Epstein logs and it definitely is</text>
  <text start="2810.62" dur="4.02">important about this date might have</text>
  <text start="2812.69" dur="6.27">some reason to do with why Bill Maher&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2814.64" dur="7.29">being so quiet let&amp;#39;s move on 3402 anon</text>
  <text start="2818.96" dur="5.97">says I see at least three staircases Q</text>
  <text start="2821.93" dur="5.16">says degree of incline indicate depth</text>
  <text start="2824.93" dur="3.24">that sounds like tricky stuff right</text>
  <text start="2827.09" dur="3.72">there I&amp;#39;m gonna have to good I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="2828.17" dur="6.72">numbers guy John John if you got three</text>
  <text start="2830.81" dur="6.51">staircases on an island and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2834.89" dur="6.72">looking at this picture right here what</text>
  <text start="2837.32" dur="5.94">do you think the angle of that is okay I</text>
  <text start="2841.61" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s I don&amp;#39;t I think</text>
  <text start="2843.26" dur="5.16">he&amp;#39;s just throwing that out there might</text>
  <text start="2845.3" dur="4.499">be 33 they&amp;#39;re all Masonic might be 33</text>
  <text start="2848.42" dur="3.359">I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2849.799" dur="2.851">complicated stuff for Matthew people but</text>
  <text start="2851.779" dur="2.55">I&amp;#39;ll bet it&amp;#39;s deep</text>
  <text start="2852.65" dur="2.76">it says indicate death the I&amp;#39;ll look at</text>
  <text start="2854.329" dur="2.641">the picture again I think it&amp;#39;s this one</text>
  <text start="2855.41" dur="3.57">right here on 11 it looks like it goes</text>
  <text start="2856.97" dur="3.24">down there pretty deep and if you look</text>
  <text start="2858.98" dur="3">back at that island again it looks like</text>
  <text start="2860.21" dur="3.089">it goes down pretty deep so who knows</text>
  <text start="2861.98" dur="2.639">what kind of knucklehead it or he goes</text>
  <text start="2863.299" dur="3.57">down in there but I&amp;#39;ll leave the math</text>
  <text start="2864.619" dur="5.131">for some of you mathy folks let&amp;#39;s move</text>
  <text start="2866.869" dur="4.591">on to 3403 21 minutes out to the hour of</text>
  <text start="2869.75" dur="3.66">10 and on basically says the same thing</text>
  <text start="2871.46" dur="3.899">that I was saying in regards to that the</text>
  <text start="2873.41" dur="4.83">flight log yeah it likely has to do with</text>
  <text start="2875.359" dur="5.641">the flight log so I&amp;#39;m gonna go pour over</text>
  <text start="2878.24" dur="4.289">that again in making this video but I</text>
  <text start="2881" dur="3.18">just wanted to point the story out for</text>
  <text start="2882.529" dur="4.171">gute men and I&amp;#39;ll leave that story for</text>
  <text start="2884.18" dur="4.83">you here this is off of Hellena</text>
  <text start="2886.7" dur="5.399">Elena glass dotnet she did a really</text>

  <text start="2892.099" dur="3.45">of great human trafficking stuff talking</text>
  <text start="2894.2" dur="3.629">about a few different topics but that</text>
  <text start="2895.549" dur="3.931">was one of them so I would imagine that</text>
  <text start="2897.829" dur="3.391">whoever&amp;#39;s on that flight law probably</text>
