  <text start="397.19" dur="4.38">connections for you today but there are</text>
  <text start="399.8" dur="3.9">some really interesting connections to</text>
  <text start="401.57" dur="3.96">be made we&amp;#39;re gonna start off with this</text>
  <text start="403.7" dur="4.62">Pearson publishing because so many</text>
  <text start="405.53" dur="4.56">things fall under it okay so Pearson</text>
  <text start="408.32" dur="3.74">publishing is an old company started</text>
  <text start="410.09" dur="4.47">back in 1844 it&amp;#39;s a British company</text>
  <text start="412.06" dur="6.46">multinational publishing company started</text>
  <text start="414.56" dur="6.24">by Samuel Pearson back in 1844 and he</text>
  <text start="418.52" dur="3.81">was a wealthy engineer and that&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="420.8" dur="6.33">important thing to remember he was a</text>
  <text start="422.33" dur="7.35">wealthy engineer and by 1919 they had</text>
  <text start="427.13" dur="4.38">acquired a big stake in the Lazar</text>
  <text start="429.68" dur="5.55">brothers merchant bankers out there in</text>

  <text start="435.23" dur="3.27">just mentioned he was a wealthy engineer</text>
  <text start="437" dur="4.95">and the reason why that&amp;#39;s important is</text>
  <text start="438.5" dur="6.21">because this Pearson company was very</text>
