  <text start="159.95" dur="5.94">read-only board we also have a Coon net</text>
  <text start="163.73" dur="4.95">this will be linked down below for you</text>
  <text start="165.89" dur="6.569">this is the cue research part of it and</text>
  <text start="168.68" dur="5.76">this is all different kinds of posts not</text>
  <text start="172.459" dur="4.621">just Q&amp;#39;s post but all kinds of an ons</text>
  <text start="174.44" dur="4.14">post just like HN used to be now there</text>
  <text start="177.08" dur="3.3">will be some posts only boards and</text>
  <text start="178.58" dur="4.379">things like that but I don&amp;#39;t want to go</text>
  <text start="180.38" dur="5.16">way into that as of yet I really would</text>
  <text start="182.959" dur="4.951">like to see some Q proofs first but this</text>
  <text start="185.54" dur="5.88">will be linked down below now we start</text>
  <text start="187.91" dur="6.18">off here at post 3571 47 minutes after</text>
  <text start="191.42" dur="5.91">the hour of - we see we have what</text>
  <text start="194.09" dur="4.32">appears to be a test here slash bas</text>
  <text start="197.33" dur="3.75">underscore test</text>
  <text start="198.41" dur="4.53">/ - and again like I said I&amp;#39;m not gonna</text>
  <text start="201.08" dur="3.96">break these down big time until we know</text>
  <text start="202.94" dur="4.26">for certain that it&amp;#39;s Q although this</text>
  <text start="205.04" dur="5.1">does look pretty compelling this is 3572</text>
  <text start="207.2" dur="5.039">two minutes after the hour three we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="210.14" dur="5.43">got what looks to be more security</text>
  <text start="212.239" dur="4.921">configurations I&amp;#39;m assuming /s EC</text>
  <text start="215.57" dur="8.19">configuration we&amp;#39;re not gonna read all</text>
  <text start="217.16" dur="9">these but a / 1 / 1 of 2 a 2 / of 3 D /</text>
  <text start="223.76" dur="4.979">1 D I&amp;#39;m assuming this is D 1 of 2 and</text>
  <text start="226.16" dur="5.31">then we have a forward slash security</text>
  <text start="228.739" dur="6.871">I&amp;#39;m assuming that security to run coms</text>
  <text start="231.47" dur="5.76">safe - and then then we have these DoD</text>
  <text start="235.61" dur="3.93">routes I&amp;#39;m not sure if that&amp;#39;s referring</text>
  <text start="237.23" dur="3.75">to the Department of Defense but it</text>
  <text start="239.54" dur="3.99">looks like there&amp;#39;s some separate channel</text>
  <text start="240.98" dur="5.22">if you&amp;#39;re 1 through 9 10 through 19 20</text>
  <text start="243.53" dur="5.519">through 29 and yes that goes pretty high</text>
  <text start="246.2" dur="6.3">and then this one here which is DoD Pack</text>
  <text start="249.049" dur="7.111">1 through 99 so this looks like some</text>
  <text start="252.5" dur="5.64">test stuff some test configurations this</text>
  <text start="256.16" dur="4.169">is all kind of pretty pretty similar</text>
  <text start="258.14" dur="3.42">stuff we&amp;#39;ve seen Q do this before looks</text>
  <text start="260.329" dur="3.781">like they&amp;#39;re testing to make sure that</text>
  <text start="261.56" dur="4.5">everything is cool for those you techies</text>
  <text start="264.11" dur="3.54">that want to weigh in on a specifics if</text>
  <text start="266.06" dur="3.99">you think you have some specifics that</text>
  <text start="267.65" dur="4.26">you can kind of cue us into but it looks</text>
  <text start="270.05" dur="3.6">like either way they are running some</text>
  <text start="271.91" dur="4.77">tests which of course code monkey has</text>
  <text start="273.65" dur="5.82">also validated over there on Twitter now</text>
  <text start="276.68" dur="4.44">let&amp;#39;s take you over here to 35 73 28</text>
  <text start="279.47" dur="4.199">minutes after the hour three weeks this</text>
  <text start="281.12" dur="3.84">YouTube link right here and it takes you</text>
  <text start="283.669" dur="4.831">right here to the</text>
  <text start="284.96" dur="5.61">- page of editor slow-motion shot of the</text>
  <text start="288.5" dur="4.259">American flag in the wind and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="290.57" dur="7.74">precisely what it is this was uploaded</text>
  <text start="292.759" dur="9.451">to YouTube in 2011 May 27th 2011 and it</text>
  <text start="298.31" dur="6.99">is a two minute and 55 second video of</text>
  <text start="302.21" dur="5.61">simply just this flag blowing in the</text>
  <text start="305.3" dur="6.51">wind now for anybody who is curious I</text>
  <text start="307.82" dur="7.29">went to post 255 and that is from the</text>
  <text start="311.81" dur="6.09">5th of December 2017 where Q says learn</text>
  <text start="315.11" dur="4.14">to read the map you have more than you</text>

  <text start="381.47" dur="6.33">post was from the 27th of july 2019 and</text>
  <text start="384.94" dur="4.42">where this was referring to a status</text>
  <text start="387.8" dur="3.239">where Comey was talking about the corn</text>
  <text start="389.36" dur="5.88">remember he was outstanding in his field</text>
  <text start="391.039" dur="5.581">was the corn ripe for harvesting it is</text>
  <text start="395.24" dur="4.14">now and this is where we saw this</text>
  <text start="396.62" dur="5.34">curious set of brackets with this 93</text>
  <text start="399.38" dur="4.74">dark so it looks like Q is confirming or</text>
  <text start="401.96" dur="5.489">whoever&amp;#39;s posting if it is indeed Q is</text>
  <text start="404.12" dur="6.18">confirming that this was exactly 93 days</text>
  <text start="407.449" dur="5.851">dark our next link comes to us from our</text>
  <text start="410.3" dur="5.429">boy Wyatt and say when L a on Twitter</text>
  <text start="413.3" dur="4.919">does a lot of great stuff on Twitter</text>
  <text start="415.729" dur="5.28">mob prosecutor John Durham was not</text>
  <text start="418.219" dur="5.961">appointed by AG bar Durham served as</text>
  <text start="421.009" dur="7.041">interim US Attorney since October 28th</text>
  <text start="424.18" dur="6.489">2017 after sessions appointed him</text>
  <text start="428.05" dur="5.229">coincidentally the same day Q began</text>
  <text start="430.669" dur="6.21">posting president Trump nominated Durham</text>
  <text start="433.279" dur="6.271">as US Attorney on November 1st 2017 F me</text>
  <text start="436.879" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s happening and there I&amp;#39;m flashing</text>
  <text start="439.55" dur="4.38">you a little link to an article right</text>
  <text start="441.889" dur="6.03">there where you can see the date October</text>
  <text start="443.93" dur="6.329">27 2017 Durham was named US Attorney one</text>
  <text start="447.919" dur="4.86">day before the queue drops started</text>
  <text start="450.259" dur="4.74">appearing all right so it sounds like</text>
  <text start="452.779" dur="6.301">the corn is ready for to be cut and</text>
  <text start="454.999" dur="6.271">finally Q says rig for red queue so we</text>
  <text start="459.08" dur="4.44">talking about something about to surface</text>
  <text start="461.27" dur="3.959">this sounds like submarine terms now I</text>
  <text start="463.52" dur="4.649">want to take you over here to this is</text>
  <text start="465.229" dur="3.99">actually called movie mistakes calm but</text>
  <text start="468.169" dur="2.701">I thought this was relevant because</text>
  <text start="469.219" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re talking about the movie The Hunt</text>
  <text start="470.87" dur="4.229">for Red October which Q is mentioned</text>
  <text start="472.849" dur="4.081">many many times but they&amp;#39;re pointing out</text>
  <text start="475.099" dur="4.68">a factual error that I want to point out</text>
  <text start="476.93" dur="5.519">in relation to this when the USS Dallas</text>
  <text start="479.779" dur="4.741">submerges to attack the Red October they</text>
  <text start="482.449" dur="5.94">rigged for battle stations as well as</text>
  <text start="484.52" dur="7.379">rig for red on a submarine rig for red</text>
  <text start="488.389" dur="6.18">is only for periscope depth operations</text>
  <text start="491.899" dur="5.07">at night to allow control-room watch</text>
  <text start="494.569" dur="5.611">standers eyes to adjust to the darkness</text>
  <text start="496.969" dur="5.611">topside no other area on the boat rigs</text>
  <text start="500.18" dur="4.56">for red so it sounds like missions no</text>
  <text start="502.58" dur="5.819">naval ship would reduce visibility on</text>
  <text start="504.74" dur="5.579">purpose in a heightened state okay so we</text>
  <text start="508.399" dur="4.111">about to show something coming up</text>
  <text start="510.319" dur="5.64">towards the surface it&amp;#39;s a bacon II</text>
  <text start="512.51" dur="3.809">cheesy goodness about to arise you tell</text>
  <text start="515.959" dur="3.091">me</text>
  <text start="516.319" dur="5.91">so is Q wanting our eyes to adjust to</text>
  <text start="519.05" dur="5.76">the dark not so sure but the Washington</text>
  <text start="522.229" dur="4.951">compost posted this curious title World</text>
  <text start="524.81" dur="3.87">War two s atomic bomb program was so</text>
  <text start="527.18" dur="4.5">secretive that even many of the</text>
  <text start="528.68" dur="5.219">participants were in the dark this was</text>
  <text start="531.68" dur="3.3">posted on the second and I&amp;#39;m not going</text>
  <text start="533.899" dur="2.611">to go through it I&amp;#39;ll leave it for you</text>
  <text start="534.98" dur="3.299">down below if you want to see it but</text>
  <text start="536.51" dur="3.269">it&amp;#39;s just talking about a few of these</text>
  <text start="538.279" dur="3.331">physicists that were working on the</text>
  <text start="539.779" dur="3.601">Manhattan Project and how they were only</text>
  <text start="541.61" dur="3.959">working on certain areas of the project</text>
  <text start="543.38" dur="3.56">and so they never really knew what they</text>
  <text start="545.569" dur="2.841">were building and</text>
  <text start="546.94" dur="2.94">you know just kind of telling them you</text>
  <text start="548.41" dur="3.63">know that they had this sort of innocent</text>
  <text start="549.88" dur="3.75">view of the project which is you know</text>
  <text start="552.04" dur="3.63">really pretty common stuff when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="553.63" dur="3.51">working on projects like this many times</text>
  <text start="555.67" dur="2.79">they&amp;#39;re only working in one department</text>
  <text start="557.14" dur="2.88">not realizing what they&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="558.46" dur="3.3">together but I thought the title was</text>
  <text start="560.02" dur="5.19">curious thought I&amp;#39;d share that with you</text>
  <text start="561.76" dur="5.91">so there you have it and I&amp;#39;m gonna offer</text>
  <text start="565.21" dur="5.58">up very simply I am NOT going to confirm</text>
  <text start="567.67" dur="5.1">to you 100% as of now that this is</text>
  <text start="570.79" dur="4.2">indeed Q although a lot of things seem</text>
  <text start="572.77" dur="3.87">to check out the people who migrated</text>
  <text start="574.99" dur="4.65">these over to the boards seem to think</text>
  <text start="576.64" dur="5.79">it checked out the trip coat is the same</text>
  <text start="579.64" dur="4.11">as the last Q post that could mean a</text>
  <text start="582.43" dur="3.3">couple different things but it could</text>
  <text start="583.75" dur="2.52">suggest that Q was never compromised at</text>
  <text start="585.73" dur="2.55">all</text>
  <text start="586.27" dur="3.96">so it remains to be seen but I would</text>
  <text start="588.28" dur="3.81">look at it this way either way if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="590.23" dur="4.5">skeptical or if you really believe this</text>
  <text start="592.09" dur="5.04">to be true I think that Q would be aware</text>
  <text start="594.73" dur="3.96">of our skepticism there are enough smart</text>
  <text start="597.13" dur="3.09">people trying to figure this stuff out</text>
  <text start="598.69" dur="3.99">that I think will get it sorted out</text>
  <text start="600.22" dur="4.2">pretty soon and I would imagine that Q</text>
  <text start="602.68" dur="4.26">was prepared for a situation like this</text>
  <text start="604.42" dur="4.23">if indeed Q needs to offer up a proof I</text>
  <text start="606.94" dur="3.81">would think it would come in the form of</text>
  <text start="608.65" dur="4.59">some sort of sequential picture whether</text>
  <text start="610.75" dur="5.31">we have seen previous pictures from Q</text>
  <text start="613.24" dur="5.01">before and Q ends up offering up another</text>
  <text start="616.06" dur="4.44">picture that falls from the best set q</text>
  <text start="618.25" dur="4.17">has their ways of letting us know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="620.5" dur="4.32">going on and how to make proofs we&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="624.82" dur="4.74">think that this would be no different if</text>
  <text start="626.59" dur="4.32">it indeed is true now if it&amp;#39;s not I</text>
  <text start="629.56" dur="2.73">don&amp;#39;t think that all is lost</text>
  <text start="630.91" dur="4.14">either I think there could be something</text>

  <text start="644.62" dur="4.53">more than I am and a lot of different</text>
  <text start="646.42" dur="4.59">topics so there&amp;#39;s a lot going on and we</text>
  <text start="649.15" dur="3.42">see that things are really really moving</text>
  <text start="651.01" dur="3.72">forward it looks like D class could be</text>
  <text start="652.57" dur="4.29">coming very soon we were just talking</text>

  <text start="672.28" dur="3.84">we&amp;#39;re going to get a lot more of those</text>
  <text start="673.81" dur="6.15">messages which could suggest something</text>
  <text start="676.12" dur="6.15">so much more nefarious so either way I</text>
  <text start="679.96" dur="4.41">we have enough and I think we have a lot</text>
  <text start="682.27" dur="4.29">to be optimistic about but it would be</text>
  <text start="684.37" dur="4.2">cool if QD does indeed come back now I</text>
  <text start="686.56" dur="3.84">want to leave you with this this came to</text>

  <text start="702.37" dur="3.45">might have been the packet that we saw</text>
  <text start="704.38" dur="3.06">bouncing around but I just want to point</text>
  <text start="705.82" dur="5.49">out that at the bottom it looks like a</text>

  <text start="718.12" dur="4.23">all over the world it&amp;#39;s hard to really</text>
  <text start="720.4" dur="3.33">know what&amp;#39;s truly going on but I found</text>
  <text start="722.35" dur="3.57">it interesting thought I would share it</text>
  <text start="723.73" dur="3.6">with you just to let you know and for</text>
  <text start="725.92" dur="3.24">those of you who are really good with</text>
  <text start="727.33" dur="5.46">computers maybe you even have better</text>
  <text start="729.16" dur="4.95">insight on that now let me take you</text>
  <text start="732.79" dur="3.15">through this thread I did on Twitter</text>
  <text start="734.11" dur="4.37">earlier this morning I woke up and</text>
  <text start="735.94" dur="5.37">Bernie 712 sent me this from ABC News</text>
  <text start="738.48" dur="5.47">injured my exposed electrical cable I</text>
  <text start="741.31" dur="5.07">asked sounds like a metaphor to me and</text>
  <text start="743.95" dur="4.8">here it is from ABC news new dog</text>
  <text start="746.38" dur="4.95">involved in Isis raid in Syria has been</text>
  <text start="748.75" dur="3.93">returned to duty Pentagon says the dog</text>
  <text start="751.33" dur="3.9">is a four year veteran who has</text>
  <text start="752.68" dur="4.59">participated in about 50 combat missions</text>
  <text start="755.23" dur="4.8">and was injured by exposed electrical</text>
  <text start="757.27" dur="4.35">cables now this is about a 35 second</text>
  <text start="760.03" dur="4.05">video I&amp;#39;ll let you check it out I will</text>
  <text start="761.62" dur="4.08">leave this down below for you but you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="764.08" dur="3.66">remember this dog but this was the dog</text>
  <text start="765.7" dur="4.8">that POTUS tweeted out and the original</text>
  <text start="767.74" dur="4.29">tweet they had not released its name and</text>
  <text start="770.5" dur="2.76">of course you could obviously say that</text>
  <text start="772.03" dur="2.76">that&amp;#39;s because we don&amp;#39;t want to trace it</text>
  <text start="773.26" dur="3.06">back to the operator or whatever but I</text>
  <text start="774.79" dur="5.19">want to point out that POTUS even</text>
  <text start="776.32" dur="6.09">highlighted no name the words no name</text>
  <text start="779.98" dur="5.25">now no name of course is a nickname for</text>
  <text start="782.41" dur="5.1">John McCain and according to cue they</text>
  <text start="785.23" dur="4.38">say we don&amp;#39;t say his name and his</text>
  <text start="787.51" dur="3.69">constantly referenced John McCain as no</text>
  <text start="789.61" dur="2.67">name so I want you to keep that in the</text>
  <text start="791.2" dur="3.33">back of your mind if you&amp;#39;re not familiar</text>
  <text start="792.28" dur="4.44">with that so this dog originally came</text>
  <text start="794.53" dur="4.41">out with no name has participated in</text>
  <text start="796.72" dur="5.4">about 50 combat missions quite a veteran</text>
  <text start="798.94" dur="5.46">and then they said in this video that he</text>
  <text start="802.12" dur="3.93">has returned to the arena now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="804.4" dur="3.66">been some questions to the sex of this</text>
  <text start="806.05" dur="4.32">dog originally it was a he and then it</text>
  <text start="808.06" dur="3.42">was reported to be a she but the name</text>
  <text start="810.37" dur="2.42">turned out to be</text>
  <text start="811.48" dur="3.71">Conan which is</text>
  <text start="812.79" dur="4.5">see a male name and it&amp;#39;s not named after</text>
  <text start="815.19" dur="4.29">Conan the Barbarian which is totally</text>
  <text start="817.29" dur="5.1">dope and a male</text>
  <text start="819.48" dur="6.72">it&amp;#39;s named after Conan O&amp;#39;Brien which is</text>
  <text start="822.39" dur="5.76">not as dope but also a male either way</text>
  <text start="826.2" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s a male so we didn&amp;#39;t know if this</text>
  <text start="828.15" dur="4.2">was a female dog male dog all right no</text>
  <text start="830.79" dur="3.42">big deal right but let&amp;#39;s keep in mind</text>
  <text start="832.35" dur="4.98">that it originally before it was called</text>
  <text start="834.21" dur="5.22">Conan we just called it no name well I</text>
  <text start="837.33" dur="4.62">didn&amp;#39;t get blown up it got injured by</text>
  <text start="839.43" dur="5.52">exposed electrical cables which led me</text>
  <text start="841.95" dur="4.77">to think I see some exposed cables here</text>
  <text start="844.95" dur="3.9">too and you can see a picture of the</text>
  <text start="846.72" dur="4.71">sitch room right there there&amp;#39;s POTUS</text>
  <text start="848.85" dur="3.9">aspart pants and Milly and they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="851.43" dur="2.49">getting around the sit room there we</text>
  <text start="852.75" dur="3.24">can&amp;#39;t see everybody&amp;#39;s that pit that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="853.92" dur="3.75">pictured in there now I want to point</text>
  <text start="855.99" dur="3.81">out you will see in the foreground here</text>
  <text start="857.67" dur="3.96">my eye pot logo on the iPad that is</text>
  <text start="859.8" dur="3.24">photoshopped it&amp;#39;s an awesome Photoshop</text>
  <text start="861.63" dur="2.82">and I thought it was pretty sweet but</text>
  <text start="863.04" dur="3.06">it&amp;#39;s not real be cool but we&amp;#39;re though</text>
  <text start="864.45" dur="3.39">we don&amp;#39;t know who&amp;#39;s sitting at that iPad</text>
  <text start="866.1" dur="3.24">but what I want to point out here is</text>
  <text start="867.84" dur="2.91">that I&amp;#39;ve seen other pictures of the</text>
  <text start="869.34" dur="3.03">Situation Room before but I&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="870.75" dur="4.08">seen this opened up it looks like this</text>
  <text start="872.37" dur="3.96">opens up here to expose you know</text>
  <text start="874.83" dur="4.35">different ethernet cables and whatnot</text>
  <text start="876.33" dur="4.62">but it&amp;#39;s evidently it&amp;#39;s been left a mess</text>
  <text start="879.18" dur="3.45">here now in most pictures that you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="880.95" dur="3.15">see the Situation Room this is actually</text>
  <text start="882.63" dur="4.11">closed and there&amp;#39;s not so many laptops</text>
  <text start="884.1" dur="4.11">on the you don&amp;#39;t see all the iPads</text>
  <text start="886.74" dur="3.3">you&amp;#39;ll see a little monitor like the one</text>
  <text start="888.21" dur="3.78">that you see near POTUS but you won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="890.04" dur="3.27">see all the other laptops so it could be</text>
  <text start="891.99" dur="3.39">that they just busted it out here but it</text>
  <text start="893.31" dur="3.66">seems like a lot of cables here and you</text>
  <text start="895.38" dur="3.33">can see this red one here the detached</text>
  <text start="896.97" dur="4.41">cable here that&amp;#39;s not connected to</text>
  <text start="898.71" dur="5.19">anything seems like a mess for such a</text>
  <text start="901.38" dur="4.32">posed picture and keep in mind it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="903.9" dur="3.15">posed picture the other pictures that</text>
  <text start="905.7" dur="2.97">you&amp;#39;ll see where you don&amp;#39;t see the mess</text>
  <text start="907.05" dur="2.82">usually are more candid pictures and</text>
  <text start="908.67" dur="2.55">stuff like that they&amp;#39;re not posed the</text>
  <text start="909.87" dur="3.42">way this is they&amp;#39;re actually looking</text>
  <text start="911.22" dur="3.99">towards the camera so it seems to me</text>
  <text start="913.29" dur="4.11">like they want to highlight the cables</text>
  <text start="915.21" dur="3.75">scrolling down an IT person weighs in</text>
  <text start="917.4" dur="3.27">with the obvious and I don&amp;#39;t know this</text>
  <text start="918.96" dur="3.66">person Arkansas diamond on Twitter says</text>
  <text start="920.67" dur="3.87">as an IT specialist I must ask why are</text>
  <text start="922.62" dur="3.15">the cables exposed like this well I</text>
  <text start="924.54" dur="2.79">thought the same thing it just seems</text>
  <text start="925.77" dur="3.03">like such a mess remember they&amp;#39;re posing</text>
  <text start="927.33" dur="3.24">for this picture it would have been</text>
  <text start="928.8" dur="3.72">really easy for some continuity person</text>
  <text start="930.57" dur="3.66">to come and grab this and yank it out of</text>
  <text start="932.52" dur="3.21">the way they do it all the time this</text>
  <text start="934.23" dur="3.15">might be kind of a reach but a few years</text>
  <text start="935.73" dur="4.2">back we had some exposed cables of</text>
  <text start="937.38" dur="4.98">another kind remember before going to</text>
  <text start="939.93" dur="3.9">Jordan nancy-pants below us he went to</text>
  <text start="942.36" dur="3.6">Afghanistan if you remember this was</text>
  <text start="943.83" dur="3.18">just last week right and</text>
  <text start="945.96" dur="3.75">this was right around the time that</text>
  <text start="947.01" dur="4.98">Esper was also going to Jordan but the</text>
  <text start="949.71" dur="4.68">day before nancy-pants Pelosi went to</text>
  <text start="951.99" dur="4.71">Afghanistan to meet with Ashraf Ghani</text>
  <text start="954.39" dur="4.92">who is the president but also a former</text>
  <text start="956.7" dur="4.77">Ministry of Finance Minister of Finance</text>
  <text start="959.31" dur="4.47">scuse me but this video here is from</text>
  <text start="961.47" dur="3.81">Reuters I definitely can&amp;#39;t play that but</text>
  <text start="963.78" dur="3.87">this was in regards to these diplomatic</text>
  <text start="965.28" dur="4.68">cables that WikiLeaks released some</text>
  <text start="967.65" dur="4.56">years back and I want to just highlight</text>
  <text start="969.96" dur="4.5">this particular one was between the</text>
  <text start="972.21" dur="4.86">White House and various embassies all</text>
  <text start="974.46" dur="4.65">over the world diplomatic you know</text>
  <text start="977.07" dur="3.39">whether it was some sort of ambassador</text>
  <text start="979.11" dur="2.4">or whatnot they were going all over but</text>
  <text start="980.46" dur="3.78">they were coming from the White House</text>
  <text start="981.51" dur="5.64">and it was very very suspect and in</text>
  <text start="984.24" dur="5.34">particular no-name John McCain actually</text>
  <text start="987.15" dur="3.63">got caught too with the WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="989.58" dur="3.66">release I don&amp;#39;t think it was the same</text>
  <text start="990.78" dur="5.31">release but this was in regards to him</text>
  <text start="993.24" dur="5.4">wanting to talk to the TOWIE Churkin who</text>
  <text start="996.09" dur="4.83">was the Russian ambassador to the United</text>
  <text start="998.64" dur="5.13">Nations and this was in regards to</text>
  <text start="1000.92" dur="6.12">getting a donation to him and Sarah</text>
  <text start="1003.77" dur="6.84">Palin&amp;#39;s campaign fund so McCain was</text>
  <text start="1007.04" dur="7.32">involved in some exposed cables if you</text>
  <text start="1010.61" dur="6.81">will so a dog who originally had no name</text>
  <text start="1014.36" dur="4.8">McCain was injured by exposed cables</text>
  <text start="1017.42" dur="3.81">POTUS also mentioned that they knew</text>
  <text start="1019.16" dur="4.38">about the tunnels in Syria I wonder if</text>
  <text start="1021.23" dur="3.78">this help maybe this dog will hunt and</text>
  <text start="1023.54" dur="3.57">you can see the picture here here is</text>
  <text start="1025.01" dur="3.6">Senator no-name McCain right here I</text>
  <text start="1027.11" dur="2.97">don&amp;#39;t remember all these names right off</text>
  <text start="1028.61" dur="3.96">the top of my head but this is a moss</text>
  <text start="1030.08" dur="4.77">Mustafa from the Assyrian emergency Task</text>
  <text start="1032.57" dur="5.01">Force and of course over his shoulder is</text>
  <text start="1034.85" dur="5.34">Abu Bakr al-baghdadi who was recently</text>
  <text start="1037.58" dur="4.74">killed now if you ask me and this is</text>
  <text start="1040.19" dur="4.95">just a suspicion but it would seem to me</text>
  <text start="1042.32" dur="5.22">that this was in the area that got</text>
  <text start="1045.14" dur="4.11">shelled the first time actually this</text>
  <text start="1047.54" dur="3.54">would have been last year but it</text>
  <text start="1049.25" dur="4.08">happened again just the the other day</text>
  <text start="1051.08" dur="4.17">when we killed al-baghdadi right and you</text>
  <text start="1053.33" dur="3.45">can see the town markings down there on</text>
  <text start="1055.25" dur="2.34">the windows there they look like little</text>
  <text start="1056.78" dur="3.2">spiderwebs</text>
  <text start="1057.59" dur="5.37">we talked about this in September of</text>
  <text start="1059.98" dur="4.54">2018 and we were talking about McCain</text>
  <text start="1062.96" dur="3.6">being out here so what&amp;#39;s he doing out</text>
  <text start="1064.52" dur="4.86">there without Baghdadi and were there</text>
  <text start="1066.56" dur="5.1">some exposed cables that led us to out</text>
  <text start="1069.38" dur="4.5">Baghdady could that have created the</text>
  <text start="1071.66" dur="4.2">panic and was that why Pelosi and shift</text>
  <text start="1073.88" dur="3.72">were out there talking to world leaders</text>
  <text start="1075.86" dur="3.689">in the Middle East just around the same</text>
  <text start="1077.6" dur="5.1">time as Secretary of Defense</text>
  <text start="1079.549" dur="4.98">Esper was now McKinney died on dog day</text>
  <text start="1082.7" dur="3">being national dog day and I say for</text>
  <text start="1084.529" dur="2.88">those who debate that he died the day</text>
  <text start="1085.7" dur="2.969">after it was already dog day in other</text>
  <text start="1087.409" dur="2.791">parts of the world I kind of a spoke</text>
  <text start="1088.669" dur="4.08">there what I meant to say is that it was</text>
  <text start="1090.2" dur="4.65">already dog day in other parts of the</text>
  <text start="1092.749" dur="4.471">world meaning that it would have seemed</text>
  <text start="1094.85" dur="5.279">like beforehand but yes he did indeed</text>
  <text start="1097.22" dur="4.309">die on dog day and of course Q had</text>
  <text start="1100.129" dur="4.351">predicted that months before saying</text>
  <text start="1101.529" dur="5.201">every dog has its day</text>
  <text start="1104.48" dur="3.929">I guess it&amp;#39;s plausible deniability that</text>
  <text start="1106.73" dur="5.879">you didn&amp;#39;t predict it but it seemed like</text>
  <text start="1108.409" dur="6.15">you might unknown our dog now Conan was</text>
  <text start="1112.609" dur="3.991">hurt by exposed cables maybe not the</text>
  <text start="1114.559" dur="3.901">same tunnel but highly likely the same</text>
  <text start="1116.6" dur="3.809">tunnel network yeah if you go back to my</text>
  <text start="1118.46" dur="3.899">videos from around the time that Q</text>
  <text start="1120.409" dur="4.74">posted those pictures we were talking</text>
  <text start="1122.359" dur="4.831">about Holmes he&amp;#39;d live in Syria and a</text>
  <text start="1125.149" dur="4.86">lot of those tunnels got bombed bombed</text>
  <text start="1127.19" dur="4.979">out and so did the nearby Airport and a</text>
