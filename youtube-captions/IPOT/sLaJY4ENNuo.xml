  <text start="217.23" dur="4.93">incessantly here is a tweet from the</text>
  <text start="219.79" dur="4.62">POTUS from October 29th we have</text>
  <text start="222.16" dur="5.43">Declassified a picture of the wonderful</text>
  <text start="224.41" dur="5.64">dog named not Declassified that did such</text>
  <text start="227.59" dur="5.91">a great job in capturing and killing the</text>
  <text start="230.05" dur="5.7">leader of Isis Abu Bakr al-baghdadi and</text>
  <text start="233.5" dur="4.44">there&amp;#39;s the Doge right there this is a</text>
  <text start="235.75" dur="6.51">retweet from the White House and they</text>
  <text start="237.94" dur="7.38">say a very good boy yeah I feel like</text>
  <text start="242.26" dur="5.61">I&amp;#39;ve heard that before but anyway there</text>
  <text start="245.32" dur="5.55">is our dog and many of you know this</text>
  <text start="247.87" dur="5.4">story already story is this dog was one</text>
  <text start="250.87" dur="6.36">of what may have been a team of dogs</text>
  <text start="253.27" dur="6.69">that cornered Abu Bakr al-baghdadi right</text>
  <text start="257.23" dur="5.1">before he blew himself up now I&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="259.96" dur="3.54">conflicting reports but evidently the</text>
  <text start="262.33" dur="3.12">dogs are seeing some pretty good</text>
  <text start="263.5" dur="6.39">injuries and some were even saying that</text>
  <text start="265.45" dur="7.5">I might even lose its leg so either way</text>
  <text start="269.89" dur="5.61">looks like we&amp;#39;ve got ourselves a hero</text>
  <text start="272.95" dur="3.96">that cornered a coward I brought it very</text>
  <text start="275.5" dur="5.19">interesting that the White House set a</text>
  <text start="276.91" dur="7.17">very good boy now I&amp;#39;m not a inanimate</text>
  <text start="280.69" dur="5.91">tition but upon closer inspection of</text>
  <text start="284.08" dur="6.2">this dog it appears it might be a very</text>
  <text start="286.6" dur="3.68">good girl</text>
  <text start="293.45" dur="5.16">okay well simple enough maybe the White</text>
  <text start="296" dur="4.83">House just made a simple mistake we all</text>
  <text start="298.61" dur="5.55">make them I just pointed it out right</text>
  <text start="300.83" dur="5.13">details details but I found it very</text>
  <text start="304.16" dur="4.83">interesting that they referred to this</text>
  <text start="305.96" dur="4.14">girl as a very good boy more on that in</text>
  <text start="308.99" dur="2.73">a minute but we&amp;#39;re over here at</text>
  <text start="310.1" dur="3.9">Breitbart turns out we have some</text>
  <text start="311.72" dur="5.58">information about our dog whose name is</text>

  <text start="319.94" dur="4.44">killed Baghdadi additional details have</text>
  <text start="322.64" dur="4.28">emerged regarding the hero dog that</text>
  <text start="324.38" dur="5.61">chased Islamic state in Iraq and Syria</text>
  <text start="326.92" dur="4.84">Isis leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi into a</text>

  <text start="334.46" dur="6.12">Belgian Malinois breed is female and her</text>
  <text start="337.37" dur="5.16">name is Conan which is odd according to</text>
  <text start="340.58" dur="4.26">a report by Newsweek which added that a</text>
  <text start="342.53" dur="4.5">senior Pentagon source clarified that</text>
  <text start="344.84" dur="4.62">she was named after the comedian Conan</text>
  <text start="347.03" dur="5.67">O&amp;#39;Brien not the famed fictional</text>
  <text start="349.46" dur="5.79">character Conan the Barbarian which is</text>
  <text start="352.7" dur="4.35">much cooler in my opinion on Monday</text>
  <text start="355.25" dur="3.63">President Donald Trump released a</text>
  <text start="357.05" dur="3.51">Declassified photo of the military dog</text>
  <text start="358.88" dur="3.54">and praised her for doing such a great</text>
  <text start="360.56" dur="4.98">job in capturing and killing the leader</text>
  <text start="362.42" dur="4.35">of Isis Abu Bakr al-baghdadi okay and</text>
  <text start="365.54" dur="3.57">there&amp;#39;s the picture I don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="366.77" dur="4.68">labor this too much I do want to say</text>
  <text start="369.11" dur="3.99">down here it looks like the reports</text>
  <text start="371.45" dur="4.02">about her leg were overblown</text>
  <text start="373.1" dur="4.98">as for Conan she suffered slight wounds</text>
  <text start="375.47" dur="4.68">but is fully recovering said joints</text>

  <text start="489.669" dur="4.981">twitter and the like but we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="492.039" dur="4.861">quite a trend here with these dog tweets</text>
  <text start="494.65" dur="3.9">there truly is something to this and I</text>
  <text start="496.9" dur="3.6">do believe that this is a confirmation</text>
  <text start="498.55" dur="4.049">from the White House we&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="500.5" dur="3.96">belabor this either I wanted to show you</text>
  <text start="502.599" dur="3.781">what this was where it started from how</text>
  <text start="504.46" dur="3.69">it kind of originated but this came from</text>
  <text start="506.38" dur="3.539">an Elizabeth Warren tweet in which she</text>
  <text start="508.15" dur="4.079">used of course the very term very good</text>
  <text start="509.919" dur="3.961">boy all capitalized now that&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="512.229" dur="4.11">common thing to say about dogs I</text>
  <text start="513.88" dur="3.87">understand that all my information is</text>
  <text start="516.339" dur="3.151">really detailed in throughout these</text>
  <text start="517.75" dur="2.849">threads and again like I said I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="519.49" dur="2.58">want to keep beating you over the head</text>
  <text start="520.599" dur="3.661">with this but I do believe it to be</text>
  <text start="522.07" dur="4.32">important so that&amp;#39;s where it is that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="524.26" dur="4.53">where it is down below but also let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="526.39" dur="4.74">not ignore the obvious here not only do</text>
  <text start="528.79" dur="5.37">I think that President Trump and his</text>
  <text start="531.13" dur="5.64">crew are sending out a virtual dog</text>
  <text start="534.16" dur="4.049">whistle I think as you all know this is</text>
  <text start="536.77" dur="3.24">a cultural thing and I said this in my</text>
  <text start="538.209" dur="4.38">last video too this is incredibly</text>
  <text start="540.01" dur="4.829">offensive to it particularly extreme</text>
  <text start="542.589" dur="5.31">Islamist you know these people think the</text>
  <text start="544.839" dur="4.801">dogs are low low forms you know it is</text>
  <text start="547.899" dur="4.171">one of the most offensive things that</text>
  <text start="549.64" dur="4.56">you could say to them and to do that to</text>
  <text start="552.07" dur="4.33">call them out that way is essentially</text>
  <text start="554.2" dur="4.45">it&amp;#39;s kind of like another man sly</text>
  <text start="556.4" dur="3.39">another man as opposed to punching him</text>
  <text start="558.65" dur="2.82">in the face there&amp;#39;s something a little</text>
  <text start="559.79" dur="2.13">bit different when it&amp;#39;s a slap you know</text>
  <text start="561.47" dur="1.98">what I mean</text>
  <text start="561.92" dur="4.41">and I think that&amp;#39;s really what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="563.45" dur="4.59">on here and if you&amp;#39;ve watched we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="566.33" dur="3.6">quite a few people referring to these</text>
  <text start="568.04" dur="4.89">dogs president Trump referred to the dog</text>
  <text start="569.93" dur="4.61">of course all the generals were talking</text>
  <text start="572.93" dur="3.9">about Esper was talking about it and</text>
  <text start="574.54" dur="3.94">then of course Lindsey Graham wanted to</text>
  <text start="576.83" dur="4.02">know the identity and the dog well we</text>
  <text start="578.48" dur="4.68">now know the identity of the dog and it</text>
  <text start="580.85" dur="4.2">seems to me very odd that they could</text>
  <text start="583.16" dur="3.75">have just waited another 24 hours</text>
  <text start="585.05" dur="4.83">because now we&amp;#39;ve got the identity right</text>
  <text start="586.91" dur="4.11">we all probably understand the reason</text>
  <text start="589.88" dur="2.88">why they need to keep some of that</text>
  <text start="591.02" dur="3.24">classified because a dog leads to a</text>
  <text start="592.76" dur="3.78">handler and you lead to a handler you</text>
  <text start="594.26" dur="3.78">could lead to a crew an entire crew to</text>
  <text start="596.54" dur="3.18">be found out in dead we learned this</text>
  <text start="598.04" dur="3.84">from the Vietnam War so that shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="599.72" dur="5.22">be surprising however what is surprising</text>
  <text start="601.88" dur="6">is that even though it was declassify or</text>
  <text start="604.94" dur="4.74">not classified excuse me excuse me the</text>
  <text start="607.88" dur="4.02">picture was classified but the name was</text>
  <text start="609.68" dur="4.65">not it seems to me you could have just</text>
  <text start="611.9" dur="5.52">waited if you were truly worried about</text>
  <text start="614.33" dur="5.97">the safety of soldier the dog etc etc so</text>
  <text start="617.42" dur="4.89">it remains to be seen on its face even</text>
  <text start="620.3" dur="4.65">if this is nothing at all and it just is</text>
  <text start="622.31" dur="4.05">a simple case of a very heroic dog which</text>

  <text start="645.47" dur="5.16">from the White House now like I said I</text>
  <text start="649.25" dur="3.96">wanted to talk a little bit more about</text>
  <text start="650.63" dur="4.41">this al Baghdadi&amp;#39;s situation a couple of</text>

  <text start="655.04" dur="3.78">thanks to 40 head on Twitter you</text>
  <text start="657.35" dur="4.2">actually went right where I was hoping</text>
  <text start="658.82" dur="4.56">to go today already did a thread so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="661.55" dur="6.06">gonna work off your thread if you don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="671.75" dur="4.47">use that if you want that&amp;#39;s not real</text>
  <text start="673.16" dur="4.71">team song number one Wow what if Trump</text>
  <text start="676.22" dur="2.55">needed to nail down al Baghdadi&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="677.87" dur="3.15">location</text>
  <text start="678.77" dur="4.77">POTUS knew withdrawing troops from Syria</text>
  <text start="681.02" dur="4.68">would spark an uproar and Isis would be</text>
  <text start="683.54" dur="4.41">embolden because deep state ties have</text>
  <text start="685.7" dur="4.05">been cut with Syria and Isis someone had</text>
  <text start="687.95" dur="4.29">to get a message to Al bag</text>
  <text start="689.75" dur="5.04">in person well let me stop right there I</text>
  <text start="692.24" dur="4.53">do believe that to be mostly true I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="694.79" dur="4.17">not so sure the deep state cut ties have</text>
  <text start="696.77" dur="4.23">been fully cut I&amp;#39;m not so sure they ever</text>
  <text start="698.96" dur="4.17">will be you never really know but I</text>
  <text start="701" dur="5.16">think the general idea is definitely on</text>
  <text start="703.13" dur="4.86">point number two but who could go there</text>
  <text start="706.16" dur="3.75">while missiles and bombs were being</text>
  <text start="707.99" dur="4.56">lobbed across international borders by</text>
  <text start="709.91" dur="4.35">multiple countries so Trump manages to</text>
  <text start="712.55" dur="3.51">get both sides to agree to a ceasefire</text>
  <text start="714.26" dur="4.29">if someone is going to meet with</text>
  <text start="716.06" dur="5.31">al-baghdadi they would have to go during</text>
  <text start="718.55" dur="4.25">the ceasefire completely on announce our</text>
  <text start="721.37" dur="4.02">number three completely unannounced</text>
  <text start="722.8" dur="6.46">Pelosi and Schiff both deep state</text>
  <text start="725.39" dur="5.58">traitors both CIA suddenly head to the</text>
  <text start="729.26" dur="3.96">Middle East do you understand the</text>
  <text start="730.97" dur="4.35">significance of this timing if there was</text>
  <text start="733.22" dur="4.41">no troop pullout and if a ceasefire had</text>
  <text start="735.32" dur="4.83">not been arranged Pelosi and shift would</text>
  <text start="737.63" dur="4.68">not have gone somehow according to the</text>
  <text start="740.15" dur="4.44">New York Times al Baghdadi&amp;#39;s location is</text>
  <text start="742.31" dur="5.16">learned while Pelosi and shift are in</text>
  <text start="744.59" dur="5.28">the sandbox understand this folks al</text>
  <text start="747.47" dur="4.29">Baghdadi&amp;#39;s location was discovered while</text>
  <text start="749.87" dur="3.96">Pelosi and Schiff were on the ground in</text>
  <text start="751.76" dur="4.38">the Middle East yes and I want to point</text>
  <text start="753.83" dur="4.47">out if you remember Pelosi first went to</text>
  <text start="756.14" dur="4.5">Afghanistan and then she went to Jordan</text>
  <text start="758.3" dur="4.26">and of course it was unannounced and I</text>
  <text start="760.64" dur="4.38">find it very ironic and of course many</text>
  <text start="762.56" dur="5.37">of you understand the irony that she is</text>
  <text start="765.02" dur="4.77">criticizing President Trump for making</text>
  <text start="767.93" dur="4.86">this strike on al Baghdadi without</text>
  <text start="769.79" dur="4.95">notifying her meanwhile she&amp;#39;s over there</text>
  <text start="772.79" dur="3.6">in Afghanistan unannounced and that</text>
  <text start="774.74" dur="4.11">cruises over to Jordan whoa who else</text>
  <text start="776.39" dur="5.01">went to Jordan just a day just within a</text>
  <text start="778.85" dur="5.58">day period was of course Secretary of</text>
  <text start="781.4" dur="5.46">Defense Esper and right here you can see</text>
  <text start="784.43" dur="5.15">according to ABC she says herself she</text>
  <text start="786.86" dur="5.43">kind of wanted to compare notes with</text>
  <text start="789.58" dur="4.81">Esper sounds like an exchange of</text>
  <text start="792.29" dur="5.46">information sounds like he said she said</text>
  <text start="794.39" dur="5.46">40 head says coincidence right probably</text>
  <text start="797.75" dur="4.11">number five trump issued command</text>
  <text start="799.85" dur="4.26">authority to take out al Baghdadi last</text>
  <text start="801.86" dur="5.07">week perhaps while Pelosi and Schiff</text>
  <text start="804.11" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;re still in country don&amp;#39;t know don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="806.93" dur="3.12">know I couldn&amp;#39;t tell you there it could</text>
  <text start="808.76" dur="3.26">be one of these things where it happens</text>
  <text start="810.05" dur="4.98">in 24 hours and you grab it when you can</text>
  <text start="812.02" dur="4.96">we&amp;#39;re not really sure but I do have a</text>
  <text start="815.03" dur="3.96">feeling that with Pelosi and shift out</text>
  <text start="816.98" dur="4.95">there in the sandbox like 40 head is</text>
  <text start="818.99" dur="4.68">implying every evidently information had</text>
  <text start="821.93" dur="3.72">to have been shared this was an urgent</text>
  <text start="823.67" dur="4.38">trip they both went out there with this</text>
  <text start="825.65" dur="3.54">sense of urgency because back at home</text>
  <text start="828.05" dur="2.789">we&amp;#39;re all worried about impeachment</text>
  <text start="829.19" dur="3.3">right I&amp;#39;m surprised that they&amp;#39;re not so</text>
  <text start="830.839" dur="2.791">urgent about impeachment</text>
  <text start="832.49" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re almost can&amp;#39;t decide</text>
  <text start="833.63" dur="5.31">which one&amp;#39;s more urgent it looks like</text>
  <text start="836.54" dur="4.29">al-baghdadi may have been compromised by</text>
  <text start="838.94" dur="3.75">the very traitors involved with</text>
  <text start="840.83" dur="4.8">supporting him during Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="842.69" dur="5.07">administration how freakin poetic yes</text>
  <text start="845.63" dur="5.19">and I want to point out like I said</text>
  <text start="847.76" dur="4.62">yesterday we talked about the knowledge</text>
  <text start="850.82" dur="3.51">of the tunnels that were out there and</text>
  <text start="852.38" dur="3.99">I&amp;#39;m gonna flash a video on my screen</text>
  <text start="854.33" dur="3.57">right here because I don&amp;#39;t remember the</text>
  <text start="856.37" dur="3.18">date offhand so you&amp;#39;ll have to look at</text>
  <text start="857.9" dur="3.27">it on the screen but this was some</text>
  <text start="859.55" dur="3.69">queuing on post that I talked about and</text>
  <text start="861.17" dur="4.62">I posted it on Twitter but if you check</text>
  <text start="863.24" dur="4.32">this video out you will be able to see</text>
  <text start="865.79" dur="4.44">the situation like we were talking about</text>
  <text start="867.56" dur="5.19">these tunnels were reaching all the way</text>
  <text start="870.23" dur="4.71">out to the ocean and this is right</text>
  <text start="872.75" dur="4.53">around the area where it was a bombed of</text>
  <text start="874.94" dur="6.09">course it was homes first it laid this</text>
  <text start="877.28" dur="5.4">particular raid was in it live and it</text>
  <text start="881.03" dur="3.42">was near the border you&amp;#39;ll see the</text>
  <text start="882.68" dur="3.69">Turkish border kind of reaches down into</text>
  <text start="884.45" dur="3.63">Syria a little bit but that was an</text>
  <text start="886.37" dur="3.48">important thing to know because we knew</text>
  <text start="888.08" dur="3.57">about these tunnels and we knew about</text>
  <text start="889.85" dur="3.84">these tunnels also from information that</text>
  <text start="891.65" dur="4.29">likely could have come from Senator</text>
  <text start="893.69" dur="3.72">McCain right could have even come from</text>
  <text start="895.94" dur="3.72">Lindsey Graham we&amp;#39;re not really sure but</text>
  <text start="897.41" dur="4.35">we know Lindsey Graham was McCain&amp;#39;s lap</text>

  <text start="905.54" dur="4.11">address during Trump&amp;#39;s press conference</text>
  <text start="907.67" dur="3.87">on taking out al Baghdadi he was asked</text>
  <text start="909.65" dur="4.35">if he notified Pelosi or anybody in</text>
  <text start="911.54" dur="4.23">Congress about the planned mission Trump</text>
  <text start="914" dur="3.33">stated directly that he did not tell</text>
  <text start="915.77" dur="3.54">Pelosi because he didn&amp;#39;t want any leaks</text>
  <text start="917.33" dur="4.02">getting out or any Americans getting</text>
  <text start="919.31" dur="3.99">hurt many of you guys probably saw this</text>
  <text start="921.35" dur="4.62">you probably also saw the same exact</text>
  <text start="923.3" dur="5.34">thing in regards to guess who Adam</text>
  <text start="925.97" dur="4.59">Schiff and it happens to be that Pelosi</text>
  <text start="928.64" dur="3.66">and Adam Schiff were the two that just</text>
  <text start="930.56" dur="3.96">happened to go overseas Oh</text>
  <text start="932.3" dur="3.63">number seven Trump knows Pelosi is a</text>
  <text start="934.52" dur="3.27">traitor and their Congress can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="935.93" dur="3.63">trusted it only goes to confirm that my</text>
  <text start="937.79" dur="3.99">theory here bears weight how is it that</text>
  <text start="939.56" dur="3.75">all these coincidences occurred at just</text>
  <text start="941.78" dur="3.03">the right time if my theory is right</text>
  <text start="943.31" dur="3.779">then it was a perfect setup in the</text>
  <text start="944.81" dur="3.81">perfect trap if I&amp;#39;m right it&amp;#39;s also what</text>
  <text start="947.089" dur="4.171">was needed to draw al Baghdadi</text>
  <text start="948.62" dur="4.829">or one of his confidants out into the</text>
  <text start="951.26" dur="3.079">open and I&amp;#39;m not a hundred percent sure</text>
  <text start="953.449" dur="2.781">on that I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="954.339" dur="3.781">honest with you I don&amp;#39;t always buy these</text>
  <text start="956.23" dur="3.719">official narratives and I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="958.12" dur="3.54">care what anybody&amp;#39;s intentions are if</text>
  <text start="959.949" dur="3.06">you understand anything about military</text>

  <text start="963.009" dur="3.63">ever gonna get the true story and I</text>
  <text start="965.139" dur="3.541">think that can be for good reasons and</text>
  <text start="966.639" dur="3.63">bad just depends on how you want to look</text>
  <text start="968.68" dur="3.029">at it but the fact of the matter is that</text>
  <text start="970.269" dur="3.87">these are sensitive matters and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="971.709" dur="5.011">very likely going to get only a small</text>
  <text start="974.139" dur="4.32">portion of how it really went down but</text>
  <text start="976.72" dur="3.9">let&amp;#39;s hope that it all went down the way</text>
  <text start="978.459" dur="3.93">that we&amp;#39;re hoping right it worked it was</text>
  <text start="980.62" dur="3.48">noted by USA Today that Trump praised</text>
  <text start="982.389" dur="3.87">the intelligence community for their</text>
  <text start="984.1" dur="4.409">work in finding al Baghdadi but never</text>
  <text start="986.259" dur="4.5">once did Trump mention the CI yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="988.509" dur="4.02">I thought that was curious too and I</text>
  <text start="990.759" dur="3.901">also want to point out that a general</text>
  <text start="992.529" dur="4.201">Milley an esper said kind of the same</text>
  <text start="994.66" dur="3.96">things check it out I want to thank our</text>

  <text start="1025.89" dur="3.179">what level of involvement it would be</text>

  <text start="1136.62" dur="3.18">would you look at that Delta Force</text>
  <text start="1137.88" dur="3.96">performed this operation yes that would</text>
  <text start="1139.8" dur="3.78">be army what did we recently learn about</text>
  <text start="1141.84" dur="3.3">Delta Force they&amp;#39;re part of a very</text>
  <text start="1143.58" dur="4.02">special group that is home to the North</text>
  <text start="1145.14" dur="5.1">Virginia Army eight-hundred Intel</text>
  <text start="1147.6" dur="5.19">officers who report to trump and to q</text>
  <text start="1150.24" dur="5.31">not to mention you and me me and you us</text>
  <text start="1152.79" dur="5.79">guys we and then 40 gives us this right</text>
  <text start="1155.55" dur="5.34">here this is post 1268 introducing army</text>
  <text start="1158.58" dur="4.71">Lieutenant General Paul Nakasone II and</text>
  <text start="1160.89" dur="4.86">if you remember before that it was</text>
  <text start="1163.29" dur="5.31">Admiral Mike Rogers who was the director</text>
  <text start="1165.75" dur="5.76">of the NSA and that transition happened</text>
  <text start="1168.6" dur="4.44">early on around when Q started to post</text>
  <text start="1171.51" dur="3.3">when Q started a post it was still</text>
  <text start="1173.04" dur="4.11">Admiral Michael Rogers and you may</text>
  <text start="1174.81" dur="4.59">remember the language was a little bit</text>
  <text start="1177.15" dur="3.9">different to just pointing that out we</text>
  <text start="1179.4" dur="4.38">were introduced to lieutenant general</text>
  <text start="1181.05" dur="6.77">paul Nakasone en drop one two six eight</text>
  <text start="1183.78" dur="7.23">one plus two plus six plus eight equals</text>
  <text start="1187.82" dur="5.17">no we became the new director of the NSA</text>
  <text start="1191.01" dur="3.66">in the cyberspace command when Admiral</text>
  <text start="1192.99" dur="3.66">Mike Rogers retired you will see through</text>
  <text start="1194.67" dur="3.78">this thread it appears he is also served</text>
  <text start="1196.65" dur="3.6">with general Flynn and you can check</text>
  <text start="1198.45" dur="3.42">that out if you want and finally so</text>
  <text start="1200.25" dur="3.84">again this is all just theory looking</text>
  <text start="1201.87" dur="4.26">from the big picture in but in case</text>
  <text start="1204.09" dur="4.47">evidence surfaces that Pelosi or Schiff</text>
  <text start="1206.13" dur="4.65">are exposed as having passed info to</text>
  <text start="1208.56" dur="4.35">al-baghdadi you can say hey q went on</text>
  <text start="1210.78" dur="4.23">was tossing that fury around if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1212.91" dur="4.29">wrong it&amp;#39;s on me well it&amp;#39;s not on you I</text>
  <text start="1215.01" dur="3.87">think it&amp;#39;s pretty solid right there like</text>
  <text start="1217.2" dur="2.4">I said I do think that some information</text>
  <text start="1218.88" dur="2.88">has all</text>
  <text start="1219.6" dur="4.35">we been gathered we kind of knew this</text>
  <text start="1221.76" dur="4.08">area it was just a matter of where and</text>
  <text start="1223.95" dur="4.44">when and that very well could have been</text>
  <text start="1225.84" dur="4.17">triggered by a the removal of troops or</text>
  <text start="1228.39" dur="4.08">at least the announcement of removal of</text>
  <text start="1230.01" dur="7.26">troops and very likely the arrival of</text>
  <text start="1232.47" dur="7.319">Pelosi or little Adam skiff big thanks</text>
  <text start="1237.27" dur="4.05">to 40 head for the 40 thread much</text>
  <text start="1239.789" dur="3.691">appreciated and hopefully that&amp;#39;ll give</text>
  <text start="1241.32" dur="4.32">us a little bit of perspective on what</text>
  <text start="1243.48" dur="4.68">seems to be going on but it looks like a</text>
  <text start="1245.64" dur="4.08">running panic now let me remember eyes</text>
  <text start="1248.16" dur="3.629">you I just mentioned that Pelosi</text>
  <text start="1249.72" dur="5.43">although she did go to Jordan she</text>
  <text start="1251.789" dur="5.421">stopped off first in Afghanistan and she</text>
  <text start="1255.15" dur="4.889">was meeting with President Ashraf Ghani</text>
  <text start="1257.21" dur="5.98">Ghani before he was president was</text>
  <text start="1260.039" dur="6.721">Minister of Finance the sky was a World</text>
  <text start="1263.19" dur="6.3">Bank guy he was a UN guy Minister of</text>
  <text start="1266.76" dur="6.24">Finance now we get this hear from Joe</text>
  <text start="1269.49" dur="6.179">Leone and Joe Leone is the ambassador</text>
  <text start="1273" dur="4.559">the Israeli ambassador to Ukraine who</text>
  <text start="1275.669" dur="3.571">tweeted this interesting thing today due</text>
  <text start="1277.559" dur="3.961">to the decision of the Ministry of</text>
  <text start="1279.24" dur="5.01">Finance to breach understandings and to</text>
  <text start="1281.52" dur="4.92">alter a protocol that has been in place</text>
  <text start="1284.25" dur="5.01">for several decades we are forced to</text>
  <text start="1286.44" dur="5.25">close our embassy no consular services</text>
  <text start="1289.26" dur="4.74">will be provided and no one will be</text>
  <text start="1291.69" dur="4.56">allowed to enter and that&amp;#39;s part of one</text>
  <text start="1294" dur="4.559">of two you can see down below Israeli</text>
  <text start="1296.25" dur="4.77">diplomats are committed at all times to</text>
  <text start="1298.559" dur="4.891">strive to enhance Israel&amp;#39;s strength and</text>
  <text start="1301.02" dur="4.62">resilience unfortunately the decision of</text>
  <text start="1303.45" dur="4.74">the M ofbeing Ministry of Finance does</text>
  <text start="1305.64" dur="4.23">not leave us any choice since the vital</text>
  <text start="1308.19" dur="3.93">interests of Israel have been harmed we</text>
  <text start="1309.87" dur="2.939">hope for prompt solving of this crisis</text>
  <text start="1312.12" dur="3.6">Wow</text>
  <text start="1312.809" dur="4.651">so as you can see here we&amp;#39;ve got a</text>
  <text start="1315.72" dur="3.36">response here ambassador do I understand</text>
  <text start="1317.46" dur="3.54">you correctly that you were closing the</text>
  <text start="1319.08" dur="4.11">embassy of Israel in Ukraine for an</text>
  <text start="1321" dur="4.95">unknown period of time as which he</text>
  <text start="1323.19" dur="5.52">replies all Israeli diplomatic</text>
  <text start="1325.95" dur="4.74">representations all over the world are</text>
  <text start="1328.71" dur="5.19">closing okay so</text>
  <text start="1330.69" dur="4.859">yikes this sounds potentially huge now I</text>
  <text start="1333.9" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t want to speculate too much as of</text>
  <text start="1335.549" dur="5.61">yet but this is very curious indeed like</text>
  <text start="1337.71" dur="5.43">I just pointed out Nancy Pelosi made her</text>
  <text start="1341.159" dur="3.301">way to Afghanistan and I pointed it out</text>
  <text start="1343.14" dur="2.909">a few videos again I don&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="1344.46" dur="3.839">which video it was but it was when she</text>
  <text start="1346.049" dur="3.991">did it that I suspected that it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1348.299" dur="2.271">just that she was visiting the president</text>
  <text start="1350.04" dur="2.33">and of course</text>
  <text start="1350.57" dur="3.99">ties to terrorism over there in</text>
  <text start="1352.37" dur="4.53">Afghanistan but I suspected that it may</text>
  <text start="1354.56" dur="4.86">have something to do with the UN funding</text>
  <text start="1356.9" dur="4.56">and of course the Ministry of Finance</text>
  <text start="1359.42" dur="2.64">and now we have this action going on</text>
  <text start="1361.46" dur="2.85">here</text>
  <text start="1362.06" dur="3.84">of course the UN also seems to be</text>
  <text start="1364.31" dur="3.21">strapped for cash</text>
  <text start="1365.9" dur="4.47">so this is really really curious and now</text>
  <text start="1367.52" dur="4.29">Israel is entering the game now many of</text>
  <text start="1370.37" dur="3.18">you will probably remember some of the</text>
  <text start="1371.81" dur="3.36">cue posts that have alluded to us</text>
  <text start="1373.55" dur="4.65">getting here at some point I think we</text>
  <text start="1375.17" dur="5.1">all knew it was coming this way and this</text>
  <text start="1378.2" dur="3.99">might be the first steps to it I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1380.27" dur="4.59">ready to say that just yet but this is</text>
  <text start="1382.19" dur="4.65">indeed very curious curious for another</text>
  <text start="1384.86" dur="3.66">reason too because it would seem that if</text>
  <text start="1386.84" dur="3.93">we are ready to drop the boom on some</text>
  <text start="1388.52" dur="4.56">bad actors in the American government</text>
  <text start="1390.77" dur="4.11">one way to do that one to keep some of</text>
  <text start="1393.08" dur="5.07">them from running and we also know that</text>
  <text start="1394.88" dur="5.94">many of them hold dual passports dual</text>
  <text start="1398.15" dur="6.63">citizenship right so this might be a way</text>
  <text start="1400.82" dur="5.94">to close off the escape hatches very</text>
  <text start="1404.78" dur="4.14">interesting indeed but I will definitely</text>
  <text start="1406.76" dur="4.68">keep you posted on that I want to leave</text>
  <text start="1408.92" dur="4.14">you with one more thing and this is</text>
  <text start="1411.44" dur="3">breaking this is a Jim farmer a</text>
