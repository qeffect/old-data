  <text start="11.23" dur="3.78">is your host Sir Patrick Mak we are</text>
  <text start="13.54" dur="3.03">studying you back on my homepage again</text>
  <text start="15.01" dur="3.66">and the reason why is because I want to</text>
  <text start="16.57" dur="4.44">highlight my last video from last night</text>
  <text start="18.67" dur="5.67">this is in pursuit of truth presents q</text>
  <text start="21.01" dur="4.65">review castles and Keystone&amp;#39;s so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="24.34" dur="3.689">been a lot of talk about green castle</text>
  <text start="25.66" dur="3.75">red castle key stones and their</text>
  <text start="28.029" dur="3.871">relations and everything like that i</text>
  <text start="29.41" dur="4.02">want to let you know that other than</text>
  <text start="31.9" dur="3.78">what i&amp;#39;ve offered in this video I want</text>
  <text start="33.43" dur="4.17">to move off this topic and move on to</text>
  <text start="35.68" dur="4.02">some other things I do not want to</text>
  <text start="37.6" dur="3.36">debate anymore what castles can be this</text>
  <text start="39.7" dur="3.48">and that I think I&amp;#39;ve shown a lot of</text>
  <text start="40.96" dur="4.32">relation to the fact that either way it</text>
  <text start="43.18" dur="4.289">relates back to the u.s. army most</text>
  <text start="45.28" dur="3.51">likely building the wall now I suggested</text>
  <text start="47.469" dur="3.451">a couple theories that it could also</text>
  <text start="48.79" dur="4.47">involve the pipeline and I&amp;#39;ve shown the</text>
  <text start="50.92" dur="4.5">connections they are building the</text>
  <text start="53.26" dur="3.86">pipeline I&amp;#39;ve shown that they are so</text>
  <text start="55.42" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re building both and I think the</text>
  <text start="57.12" dur="3.64">recent reference of course is to the</text>
  <text start="59.41" dur="3.719">wall but I think we&amp;#39;ve talked it to</text>
  <text start="60.76" dur="6.3">death and for those of the people who</text>
  <text start="63.129" dur="5.431">are venturing into the SES I highly</text>
  <text start="67.06" dur="4.08">encourage you to do so I think there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="68.56" dur="5.49">lot there and the reason I&amp;#39;m not doing</text>
  <text start="71.14" dur="3.96">it is because excuse me there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="74.05" dur="3.239">other channels that are doing it well</text>
  <text start="75.1" dur="4.019">and for me to rehash that just creates</text>
  <text start="77.289" dur="4.351">an echo chamber and I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="79.119" dur="4.11">respectful or necessary I would like to</text>
  <text start="81.64" dur="3.42">dive into other things so for those of</text>
  <text start="83.229" dur="3.06">you who are working into the SES and</text>
  <text start="85.06" dur="3.33">kind of researching into those theories</text>
  <text start="86.289" dur="3.841">and who&amp;#39;s involved I&amp;#39;m familiar with the</text>
  <text start="88.39" dur="3.539">plumb list and everything like that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="90.13" dur="4.89">watching you I&amp;#39;m following you</text>
  <text start="91.929" dur="4.321">okay but we&amp;#39;re moving on now final</text>
  <text start="95.02" dur="2.07">confirmation I&amp;#39;d like to show you</text>

  <text start="115.3" dur="3.659">more about it not only is the Army</text>
  <text start="117.34" dur="3.389">building the wall they&amp;#39;ve been building</text>
  <text start="118.959" dur="5.071">the wall it&amp;#39;s just a matter of how it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="120.729" dur="5.31">gonna get paid for okay it could be that</text>
  <text start="124.03" dur="3.569">a lot of this the private companies</text>
  <text start="126.039" dur="3.541">could be contracted in certain sections</text>
  <text start="127.599" dur="3.181">it could be that that&amp;#39;s all just a dog</text>
  <text start="129.58" dur="3.39">and pony show for us in the media</text>
  <text start="130.78" dur="4.129">honestly I don&amp;#39;t really care until we</text>
  <text start="132.97" dur="5.37">hear more about the cue narrative I</text>
  <text start="134.909" dur="4.901">would like to get off of this if I may</text>
  <text start="138.34" dur="3.179">okay want to talk about some other</text>
  <text start="139.81" dur="3.72">things but before I do I want to show</text>
  <text start="141.519" dur="4.261">you just a personal thing here this is</text>
  <text start="143.53" dur="4.349">often National Geographic calm this is</text>
  <text start="145.78" dur="6.709">actually what it looks like this is the</text>
  <text start="147.879" dur="8.22">wall between the US and Tijuana Mexico</text>
  <text start="152.489" dur="5.801">and on a personal note this was my home</text>
  <text start="156.099" dur="3.86">for about 12 or 13 years now I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="158.29" dur="5.52">lived in the United States for the last</text>
  <text start="159.959" dur="5.711">ones have been 10 years now but I spent</text>
  <text start="163.81" dur="3.989">the last part of my adult life really</text>
  <text start="165.67" dur="3.539">most of my life on the border I as a</text>
  <text start="167.799" dur="3.121">younger child in between the border of</text>
  <text start="169.209" dur="4.261">Tucson and Nogales Mexico which is a</text>
  <text start="170.92" dur="4.289">border town and then in Imperial Beach</text>
  <text start="173.47" dur="3.48">California which is south San Diego it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="175.209" dur="4.5">on a peninsula south of Coronado and</text>
  <text start="176.95" dur="4.319">it&amp;#39;s literally the border of Tijuana I</text>
  <text start="179.709" dur="3.481">used to walk my dog right here to this</text>
  <text start="181.269" dur="3.931">beach and this is the border folks this</text>
  <text start="183.19" dur="3.15">is the wall but you&amp;#39;re looking at it to</text>
  <text start="185.2" dur="3.81">highlight over here on the left side</text>
  <text start="186.34" dur="5.61">this is actually where usually you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="189.01" dur="4.89">see an ATV or an armed guard in an SUV</text>
  <text start="191.95" dur="4.71">but usually it&amp;#39;s not just usually one</text>
  <text start="193.9" dur="6.03">person maybe two that I see there and as</text>
  <text start="196.66" dur="6.299">you can see the fence is I can&amp;#39;t get any</text>
  <text start="199.93" dur="4.92">closer this is a panorama a collection</text>
  <text start="202.959" dur="3">of pictures but you can see it kind of</text>
  <text start="204.85" dur="2.699">goes out into the ocean</text>
  <text start="205.959" dur="3.18">you could swim around it you&amp;#39;ll probably</text>
  <text start="207.549" dur="3.511">get caught but you could get swim around</text>
  <text start="209.139" dur="4.171">it and you know I used to walk my dog</text>
  <text start="211.06" dur="3.81">here surf here the the mouth of the</text>
  <text start="213.31" dur="2.85">Tijuana River actually comes out on the</text>
  <text start="214.87" dur="2.79">American side over here and that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="216.16" dur="3.21">we would surf it&amp;#39;s terrible water but</text>
  <text start="217.66" dur="3.479">the surfs great but you could squeeze</text>
  <text start="219.37" dur="3.209">right through those bars and so it just</text>
  <text start="221.139" dur="3.18">kind of highlights that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="222.579" dur="3.301">looking at right there and regardless of</text>
  <text start="224.319" dur="2.491">your opinion on the wall just want to</text>
  <text start="225.88" dur="3.87">give you that look</text>
  <text start="226.81" dur="5.67">anyway we are moving on I want to show</text>
  <text start="229.75" dur="4.049">you this this is a 62 page budget of the</text>
  <text start="232.48" dur="3.39">US government for the fiscal year of</text>
  <text start="233.799" dur="3.361">2018 now we&amp;#39;re not going to get into it</text>
  <text start="235.87" dur="5.699">I just want to show you the difference</text>
  <text start="237.16" dur="7.109">between the budget and what this is</text>
  <text start="241.569" dur="4.591">which is the Omnibus the hr:162 five</text>
  <text start="244.269" dur="3.541">which Trump just signed the other day</text>
  <text start="246.16" dur="5.159">and we&amp;#39;re going to get into this today</text>
  <text start="247.81" dur="6.329">okay now please what I basically want to</text>
  <text start="251.319" dur="4.711">do with this video is I do not really</text>
  <text start="254.139" dur="3.541">want to get into a lot of details and</text>
  <text start="256.03" dur="4.59">theories I want to offer up some</text>
  <text start="257.68" dur="4.53">sections that I skimmed that might be</text>
  <text start="260.62" dur="3.75">able to open up some rabbit holes for</text>
  <text start="262.21" dur="4.98">some of you if you have some ideas on</text>
  <text start="264.37" dur="5.46">those I I really encourage you to send</text>
  <text start="267.19" dur="4.229">them back to me please via email if you</text>
  <text start="269.83" dur="2.01">got a big suggestion don&amp;#39;t send it on</text>
  <text start="271.419" dur="1.891">the common</text>
  <text start="271.84" dur="3.359">I&amp;#39;m probably not gonna get a chance to</text>
  <text start="273.31" dur="3.99">read it it might come across a spam and</text>
  <text start="275.199" dur="3.69">it may never even show up so if you</text>
  <text start="277.3" dur="3.57">really find something that you think is</text>
  <text start="278.889" dur="4.141">important please use discretion I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="280.87" dur="3.12">inundated with information already but</text>
  <text start="283.03" dur="3.449">if you really think there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="283.99" dur="4.5">that you you you need to see or you want</text>
  <text start="286.479" dur="4.171">to share with me please email me my</text>
  <text start="288.49" dur="5.01">email link will be down below and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="290.65" dur="5.91">always at the end of every video okay we</text>
  <text start="293.5" dur="4.29">are moving on and I like to dive</text>
  <text start="296.56" dur="2.49">straight in the middle I haven&amp;#39;t covered</text>
  <text start="297.79" dur="3.18">the first half and the reason I do that</text>
  <text start="299.05" dur="3.149">is because I&amp;#39;ve always thought that when</text>
  <text start="300.97" dur="2.19">you go on a needle in a haystack for</text>
  <text start="302.199" dur="4.201">you&amp;#39;re looking for a needle in a</text>
  <text start="303.16" dur="5.009">haystack the easiest way to mean to find</text>
  <text start="306.4" dur="3.269">it is to just jump in the haystack and</text>
  <text start="308.169" dur="4.891">let it find you if you know what I mean</text>
  <text start="309.669" dur="5.071">all right so we are on page 513 this is</text>
  <text start="313.06" dur="4.29">court security including transfer of</text>
  <text start="314.74" dur="4.44">funds for necessary expenses not</text>
  <text start="317.35" dur="3.93">otherwise provided for incident to the</text>

  <text start="349.72" dur="4.319">judicial improvement and access to</text>
  <text start="351.55" dur="4.2">justice Act okay I won&amp;#39;t cover the rest</text>
  <text start="354.039" dur="4.821">of this here now this may be completely</text>
  <text start="355.75" dur="5.729">innocuous but if you saw my last video</text>
  <text start="358.86" dur="4.21">talking about the Omnibus then you&amp;#39;d see</text>
  <text start="361.479" dur="3.421">that there was a section there that sort</text>
  <text start="363.07" dur="4.71">of implied that we it was a lot of</text>
  <text start="364.9" dur="5.13">spending for well they were for bunkers</text>
  <text start="367.78" dur="6.81">they were literally bunkers that were</text>
  <text start="370.03" dur="6.03">supposed to house witnesses it was like</text>
  <text start="374.59" dur="3.66">a witness protection now</text>
  <text start="376.06" dur="4.41">witness protection it these weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="378.25" dur="4.349">witness protection homes this wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="380.47" dur="3.569">witness protection housing this implied</text>
  <text start="382.599" dur="4.081">at least implied to me through the</text>
  <text start="384.039" dur="4.35">language that it was bunkers so if there</text>
  <text start="386.68" dur="3.72">are flights that&amp;#39;s going to get mow and</text>
  <text start="388.389" dur="3.511">if there are going to be any kind of</text>
  <text start="390.4" dur="3.03">military tribunals remember there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="391.9" dur="3.12">going to be witnesses and there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="393.43" dur="3.12">to be lawyers and they&amp;#39;re gonna be there</text>
  <text start="395.02" dur="4.14">for days and they&amp;#39;re gonna need</text>
  <text start="396.55" dur="4.14">protection evidently because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="399.16" dur="2.85">building bunkers now maybe that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="400.69" dur="2.89">mean anything maybe doesn&amp;#39;t maybe I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="402.01" dur="3.58">looking too much into that but that</text>
  <text start="403.58" dur="3.66">where we were with the last video this</text>
  <text start="405.59" dur="3.21">could be very very innocent stuff this</text>
  <text start="407.24" dur="3.169">could be just run-of-the-mill stuff I</text>
  <text start="408.8" dur="4.889">don&amp;#39;t know what the normal numbers are</text>
  <text start="410.409" dur="6.551">but this is a section here over the next</text>
  <text start="413.689" dur="5.641">few pages of this discussing maintenance</text>
  <text start="416.96" dur="4.29">security equipment things like that it</text>
  <text start="419.33" dur="4.679">might be nothing at all but if you want</text>
  <text start="421.25" dur="7.02">to dig into it there you have it we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="424.009" dur="10.741">gonna move on to the next now I&amp;#39;m here</text>
  <text start="428.27" dur="7.859">at page 1940 of 2232 and we won&amp;#39;t get to</text>
  <text start="434.75" dur="4.5">meant much into specifics but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="436.129" dur="6.51">some sort of language here that talks</text>
  <text start="439.25" dur="6.9">about patients with you know forms of</text>
  <text start="442.639" dur="5.191">dementia Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease they talk</text>
  <text start="446.15" dur="5.4">about a few different things maybe</text>
  <text start="447.83" dur="5.399">people that are on medication and you</text>
  <text start="451.55" dur="3.989">know programs that will kind of keep</text>
  <text start="453.229" dur="6.12">them off the streets or not allow them</text>
  <text start="455.539" dur="5.551">to kind of wander or get lost or then</text>
  <text start="459.349" dur="3.991">basically what I was starting to get it</text>
  <text start="461.09" dur="3.419">get turned on too is that they&amp;#39;re kind</text>
  <text start="463.34" dur="3.66">of trying to protect these people that</text>
  <text start="464.509" dur="5.28">maybe get they wander off and who knows</text>
  <text start="467" dur="4.889">people take them or they get hurt or it</text>
  <text start="469.789" dur="8.94">seems innocent enough but I want to take</text>
  <text start="471.889" dur="8.821">you down to 1940 1949 as soon as you can</text>
  <text start="478.729" dur="3.961">see there&amp;#39;s a lot of language here and a</text>
  <text start="480.71" dur="3.78">lot of this is just changing of English</text>

  <text start="484.49" dur="2.549">through here is out we go and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="485.779" dur="2.73">gonna scroll through everything here but</text>
  <text start="487.039" dur="4.201">here is where it starts to get</text>
  <text start="488.509" dur="4.701">interesting around 1949 we started</text>
  <text start="491.24" dur="3.179">talking about tribal law enforcement</text>

  <text start="649.25" dur="2.58">just kind of want to tie that together</text>
  <text start="650.3" dur="3.36">with my narrative because you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="651.83" dur="3.69">hear a lot more about the pipeline</text>
  <text start="653.66" dur="3.42">regardless of whether it&amp;#39;s connected to</text>

  <text start="660.35" dur="4.77">not being you know sort of how should I</text>
  <text start="663.709" dur="2.911">say confrontational about that I just</text>
  <text start="665.12" dur="2.82">think there&amp;#39;s really something here in</text>
  <text start="666.62" dur="3.029">the pipeline and it&amp;#39;s really important</text>
  <text start="667.94" dur="5.519">to me to figure this out when I see a</text>

  <text start="683.329" dur="4.26">one in particular that I think is</text>
  <text start="684.619" dur="5.22">noticed in in Section A and B here we</text>
  <text start="687.589" dur="4.59">talk about striking the word provider</text>
  <text start="689.839" dur="4.381">each place it appears an inserting</text>

  <text start="694.22" dur="3.479">in the plural sense here in B and it</text>
  <text start="696.259" dur="4.74">starts to affect everything here now I</text>
  <text start="697.699" dur="4.8">don&amp;#39;t exactly know how but what the next</text>
  <text start="700.999" dur="3.27">few pages seem to talk about our</text>
  <text start="702.499" dur="4.38">background checks criminal history</text>
  <text start="704.269" dur="5.79">reviews okay and it must be regarding</text>
  <text start="706.879" dur="6.21">child protection so but there was one</text>
  <text start="710.059" dur="4.44">part here where it did talk about being</text>
  <text start="713.089" dur="3.3">able to request</text>
  <text start="714.499" dur="3.27">yeah centrally part be here and I&amp;#39;ll sum</text>
  <text start="716.389" dur="3.51">it up for you here if you basically if</text>
  <text start="717.769" dur="3.42">you get a criminal background check with</text>

  <text start="721.189" dur="3.57">something like that from what it sounds</text>
  <text start="722.72" dur="4.739">like to me if they do a background check</text>
  <text start="724.759" dur="4.32">on you you have the right to see it and</text>
  <text start="727.459" dur="3.511">I think that&amp;#39;s going to become important</text>
  <text start="729.079" dur="4.95">especially with this day of social media</text>
  <text start="730.97" dur="4.95">and people kind of there for example</text>
  <text start="734.029" dur="5.341">this channel already has a strike</text>
  <text start="735.92" dur="5.31">against it does that somehow you know</text>
  <text start="739.37" dur="4.529">relay into other aspects of people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="741.23" dur="4.769">lives does something you say or do on</text>
  <text start="743.899" dur="3.451">social media does it end up you have the</text>
  <text start="745.999" dur="4.26">right to know on your background checks</text>
  <text start="747.35" dur="5.099">so interesting language indeed and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="750.259" dur="4.89">gonna move on here going to the next</text>
  <text start="752.449" dur="4.651">section and this goes down a bit to pay</text>
