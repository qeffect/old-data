  <text start="124.13" dur="7.32">well in 1977 we had an accidental</text>
  <text start="128.84" dur="12.45">emergency act I have the absolute right</text>
  <text start="131.45" dur="12.48">to do that okay so there you go and he</text>
  <text start="141.29" dur="5.46">makes it real clear in 1977 check it out</text>
  <text start="143.93" dur="4.92">so I did and here it is right here the</text>
  <text start="146.75" dur="6.66">international emergency economic Powers</text>
  <text start="148.85" dur="6.84">Act enacted on October 28 1977 is the</text>

  <text start="162.83" dur="4.17">extraordinary threat to the United</text>
  <text start="164.72" dur="4.049">States which has its source and whole or</text>
  <text start="167" dur="3.48">substantial part outside the United</text>
  <text start="168.769" dur="4.411">States okay so this sounds a little bit</text>
  <text start="170.48" dur="4.53">more than like it&amp;#39;s about more than just</text>
  <text start="173.18" dur="4.43">tariffs right this sounds really really</text>
  <text start="175.01" dur="4.86">interesting are we talking about Huawei</text>
  <text start="177.61" dur="4.599">what are we talking about here what is</text>
  <text start="179.87" dur="4.71">this unusual and extraordinary threat</text>
  <text start="182.209" dur="4.441">what we know China is a threat right we</text>
  <text start="184.58" dur="3.239">know that a lot of their a lot of the</text>
  <text start="186.65" dur="2.73">parts that they were making that were</text>
  <text start="187.819" dur="2.73">either going in electronics phones</text>
  <text start="189.38" dur="2.94">things like that</text>
  <text start="190.549" dur="4.381">we&amp;#39;re spying on us and of course they</text>
  <text start="192.32" dur="4.199">were trying to get their 5g Network over</text>
  <text start="194.93" dur="4.17">here in the United States really long</text>
  <text start="196.519" dur="4.921">before we could and although I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="199.1" dur="4.29">real excited about the whole 5g thing</text>
  <text start="201.44" dur="4.079">that&amp;#39;s all another conversation in</text>
  <text start="203.39" dur="3.9">itself that was a big part of what this</text>
  <text start="205.519" dur="3.69">was all about right now let&amp;#39;s go down</text>
  <text start="207.29" dur="4.919">here to the provisions in the United</text>
  <text start="209.209" dur="8.071">States Code the IE EPA is a title 50</text>
  <text start="212.209" dur="7.111">fancy stuff 1701 1707 the IE EPA</text>
  <text start="217.28" dur="3.45">authorizes the President to declare the</text>
  <text start="219.32" dur="3.24">existence of an unusual and</text>
  <text start="220.73" dur="4.47">extraordinary threat to the National</text>
  <text start="222.56" dur="4.83">Security foreign policy or economy of</text>
  <text start="225.2" dur="3.99">the United States that originates in</text>
  <text start="227.39" dur="3.21">whole or substantial part outside the</text>
  <text start="229.19" dur="3.71">United States that would be China I</text>
  <text start="230.6" dur="4.68">guess in this case right it further</text>
  <text start="232.9" dur="4.57">authorizes the president after such a</text>
  <text start="235.28" dur="5.429">declaration to block transactions and</text>
  <text start="237.47" dur="4.859">freeze assets to deal with the threat</text>
  <text start="240.709" dur="3.84">okay so well like I said this sounds</text>
  <text start="242.329" dur="4.201">like a little bit more than just tariffs</text>
  <text start="244.549" dur="4.711">right in the event of an actual attack</text>
  <text start="246.53" dur="4.47">on the United States the president can</text>
  <text start="249.26" dur="4.08">also confiscate property connected with</text>
  <text start="251" dur="3.959">a country group or person that aided in</text>
  <text start="253.34" dur="4.11">that attack okay so this sounds pretty</text>
  <text start="254.959" dur="4.111">serious right here the IEP</text>
  <text start="257.45" dur="3.27">falls under the provisions of the</text>
  <text start="259.07" dur="3.3">national emergencies act which means</text>
  <text start="260.72" dur="3.99">that an emergency declared on the b act</text>
  <text start="262.37" dur="4.59">must be renewed annually to remain in</text>
  <text start="264.71" dur="4.62">effect okay so there is what he was</text>
  <text start="266.96" dur="3.78">talking about and obviously he wanted us</text>
  <text start="269.33" dur="4.2">to check up on that because he said it</text>
  <text start="270.74" dur="6.45">twice go check it out and of course I</text>
  <text start="273.53" dur="6.78">also wanted to go check out post 1977</text>
  <text start="277.19" dur="6.96">and that was from August 29th of 2018</text>
  <text start="280.31" dur="5.82">nearly a year ago and I will get to this</text>
  <text start="284.15" dur="4.62">link here in a second that it was a</text>

  <text start="306.479" dur="4.711">sound relevant g7 coming POTUS is out of</text>
  <text start="309.06" dur="5.19">the country and this tweet was also</text>
  <text start="311.19" dur="7.979">posted on August 29th nearly a year ago</text>
  <text start="314.25" dur="6.63">oddly enough at 11:11 a.m. and it says</text>
  <text start="319.169" dur="4.53">Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s emails many of which</text>
  <text start="320.88" dur="4.86">are classified information got hacked by</text>
  <text start="323.699" dur="5.34">China ah maybe that&amp;#39;s what you were</text>
  <text start="325.74" dur="6.84">talking about 1977 for next move better</text>
  <text start="329.039" dur="6">be by the FBI and DOJ or after all their</text>
  <text start="332.58" dur="5.7">other missteps Comey McCabe struck page</text>
  <text start="335.039" dur="5.91">or FISA dirty dossier etc their</text>
  <text start="338.28" dur="5.1">credibility will be forever gone okay</text>
  <text start="340.949" dur="4.5">well this was relevant last year but it</text>
  <text start="343.38" dur="4.86">most certainly is relevant again this</text>
  <text start="345.449" dur="4.891">year maybe that&amp;#39;s what Donald Trump is</text>
  <text start="348.24" dur="5.01">talking about in referencing us to this</text>
  <text start="350.34" dur="5.639">emergencies Act of 1977 showing that</text>
  <text start="353.25" dur="5.4">China is indeed a foreign threat this</text>
  <text start="355.979" dur="5.25">wasn&amp;#39;t just about tariffs this was about</text>
  <text start="358.65" dur="3.81">Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s emails now we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="361.229" dur="2.841">to start getting a lot of this other</text>
  <text start="362.46" dur="3.239">stuff or at least now we have some more</text>
  <text start="364.07" dur="3.04">announcements that have been made this</text>
  <text start="365.699" dur="4.351">week we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about that in just</text>
  <text start="367.11" dur="5.85">a second but Comey McCabe&amp;#39;s draw page or</text>
  <text start="370.05" dur="5.369">FISA dirty dossier all sounded like</text>
  <text start="372.96" dur="4.53">placeholders to me and Q has talked</text>
  <text start="375.419" dur="3.901">about placeholders being put on the</text>
  <text start="377.49" dur="3.81">Patriots fight board and I have a</text>
  <text start="379.32" dur="3.69">feeling we&amp;#39;re gonna start seeing those</text>
  <text start="381.3" dur="3.75">again soon and of course that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="383.01" dur="3.659">results in this next part of the threat</text>
  <text start="385.05" dur="3.78">perhaps that&amp;#39;s why McCabe decided to get</text>
  <text start="386.669" dur="4.411">off the couch and get a job with C and</text>
  <text start="388.83" dur="4.53">and as you know number two at the FBI</text>
  <text start="391.08" dur="5.369">decided to take himself a little talking</text>
  <text start="393.36" dur="5.13">head gig over there on CNN now before</text>
  <text start="396.449" dur="4.261">you get all outraged I would say that</text>
  <text start="398.49" dur="3.54">this is pretty natural as a matter of</text>
  <text start="400.71" dur="3.81">fact I mean we know that this is a</text>
  <text start="402.03" dur="4.919">desperate man commis desperate mccabe is</text>
  <text start="404.52" dur="4.44">desperate and so this isn&amp;#39;t because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="406.949" dur="3.931">taken some coin and he&amp;#39;s all laughing at</text>
  <text start="408.96" dur="4.29">us in the process this is a desperate</text>
  <text start="410.88" dur="3.539">man going on to a desperate network to</text>
  <text start="413.25" dur="3.3">try and tell his side of the story</text>
  <text start="414.419" dur="3.511">because it&amp;#39;s about to get ugly and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="416.55" dur="4.14">about to find some more out about</text>
  <text start="417.93" dur="4.079">nobodies who me Kumi which is going to</text>
  <text start="420.69" dur="4.71">take us of course straight back to</text>

  <text start="434.74" dur="5.489">talking about noon Amy came and this was</text>
  <text start="437.259" dur="6.541">predicted back in 1649 this would have</text>
  <text start="440.229" dur="6.091">been July 1st 2018 well before last</text>
  <text start="443.8" dur="4.86">year&amp;#39;s national dog day and this is</text>
  <text start="446.32" dur="5.129">where Q had said every dog has its day</text>
  <text start="448.66" dur="4.86">and we were talking about John McCain Q</text>
  <text start="451.449" dur="3.271">was responding to it and on here and so</text>
  <text start="453.52" dur="2.61">we didn&amp;#39;t really know what this meant</text>
  <text start="454.72" dur="4.319">yet but then of course it made sense</text>
  <text start="456.13" dur="5.37">later on dog day when we lost John</text>
  <text start="459.039" dur="3.69">McCain so that was a prediction so who</text>
