  <text start="10.98" dur="7.84">hi I&amp;#39;m Doug and this is Pam we&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="16.63" dur="8.059">couple that live in upstate New York and</text>
  <text start="18.82" dur="11.22">we want to share what Q means to us I</text>
  <text start="24.689" dur="7.241">found Q online doing some research with</text>
  <text start="30.04" dur="3.48">some of the favorite citizen journalists</text>
  <text start="31.93" dur="3.48">that I was following for some of the</text>
  <text start="33.52" dur="8.46">political issues that were occurring</text>
  <text start="35.41" dur="11.85">back in Novato bur in November of 17 ha</text>
  <text start="41.98" dur="7.199">I came upon Q by reading one of our</text>
  <text start="47.26" dur="4.919">citizen journalists that we have we have</text>
  <text start="49.179" dur="6.241">a list of probably 40 different people</text>
  <text start="52.179" dur="6.36">that we enjoy listening to their</text>
  <text start="55.42" dur="6">analysis of world events political</text>
  <text start="58.539" dur="6.48">events things that are occurring well it</text>
  <text start="61.42" dur="6.96">just so happens that Q occurred in</text>
  <text start="65.019" dur="7.171">November and when that occurred I found</text>
  <text start="68.38" dur="7.79">a place where somebody which is a group</text>
  <text start="72.19" dur="8.37">of people we believe Q to be defining</text>
  <text start="76.17" dur="9.31">pretty common-sense ways that the</text>
  <text start="80.56" dur="8.58">government is now functioning to address</text>
  <text start="85.48" dur="5.82">what what we as as readers of all these</text>
  <text start="89.14" dur="4.23">citizen journalists have been believing</text>
  <text start="91.3" dur="4.5">there might be a lot of corruption in</text>
  <text start="93.37" dur="3.99">our country and so it was you know no</text>
  <text start="95.8" dur="6.02">one wants corruption in their country</text>
  <text start="97.36" dur="8.97">but we were finding a lot of very valid</text>
  <text start="101.82" dur="7.78">leads in in the news cycles that kept</text>
  <text start="106.33" dur="6.42">pointing to corruption and so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="109.6" dur="6.48">where we find that&amp;#39;s where I find my my</text>
  <text start="112.75" dur="6.57">meaning in Q is that these people have</text>
  <text start="116.08" dur="5.7">decided to give US citizens some</text>
  <text start="119.32" dur="8.64">information and prompts and leads and</text>
  <text start="121.78" dur="8.91">and Q&amp;#39;s CU e on what is occurring in our</text>
  <text start="127.96" dur="5.49">government right now in the governing</text>
  <text start="130.69" dur="5.67">bodies regardless of our president</text>
  <text start="133.45" dur="5.04">really this is this is our governing</text>
  <text start="136.36" dur="4.44">people that have been there awhile even</text>
  <text start="138.49" dur="4.08">before Donald Trump now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="140.8" dur="2.7">refreshing is the fact that it seems</text>
  <text start="142.57" dur="4.23">like Donald</text>
  <text start="143.5" dur="5.76">is very in touch with cue and</text>
  <text start="146.8" dur="5.4">understands the same dynamic that cue is</text>
  <text start="149.26" dur="7.98">expressive so to me that&amp;#39;s in a nutshell</text>
  <text start="152.2" dur="9.33">how I began my interest in cue and why</text>
  <text start="157.24" dur="6.81">it&amp;#39;s meaningful to me yeah yeah I began</text>
  <text start="161.53" dur="6.05">listening to alternate you news on</text>
  <text start="164.05" dur="8.4">YouTube when my favorite Channel PBS</text>
  <text start="167.58" dur="6.61">became so biased during the election I</text>
  <text start="172.45" dur="4.56">couldn&amp;#39;t stand it anymore</text>
  <text start="174.19" dur="5.58">when cue popped up in the fall</text>
  <text start="177.01" dur="5.16">I loved the message that the</text>
  <text start="179.77" dur="6.81">administration had a plan in place that</text>
  <text start="182.17" dur="6.51">was covert by necessity I also loved</text>
  <text start="186.58" dur="5.61">that there is no personality involved</text>
  <text start="188.68" dur="5.94">and that the writers aren&amp;#39;t trying to</text>
  <text start="192.19" dur="3.269">draw attention to themselves they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="194.62" dur="3.36">anonymous</text>
  <text start="195.459" dur="5.491">and the message is everything the</text>
  <text start="197.98" dur="6.18">personality is nothing very rare in the</text>
  <text start="200.95" dur="5.84">media most of all I love the feeling of</text>
  <text start="204.16" dur="6.359">being connected with other truth seekers</text>
  <text start="206.79" dur="8.41">who are alarmed at the concept of</text>
  <text start="210.519" dur="11.391">globalism Hugh says freedom to strengths</text>
  <text start="215.2" dur="10.289">I say Amen and PS Hugh fans aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="221.91" dur="7.57">followers we&amp;#39;re not being told to do</text>
  <text start="225.489" dur="7.171">anything except accept to take a stand</text>
  <text start="229.48" dur="6.41">for the truth and against corruption</text>
  <text start="232.66" dur="3.23">peace out</text>
