  <text start="182.629" dur="3.901">moving on all right we&amp;#39;re back to this</text>
  <text start="184.519" dur="4.43">picture flying over what we&amp;#39;re assuming</text>
  <text start="186.53" dur="4.799">now is North Korea</text>
  <text start="188.949" dur="5.591">here we go q says thank you</text>
  <text start="191.329" dur="5.52">Kim deal made clowns out meaning the CIA</text>
  <text start="194.54" dur="4.08">is out of Korea for those of you who</text>
  <text start="196.849" dur="4.47">believed that that was a conspiracy</text>
  <text start="198.62" dur="5.009">theory there you go and I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="201.319" dur="3.75">this is the ultimate truth here but that</text>
  <text start="203.629" dur="4.051">would be the assumption if the clowns</text>
  <text start="205.069" dur="6.03">are out of Korea strings cut we took</text>
  <text start="207.68" dur="7.29">control Iran next hmm</text>
  <text start="211.099" dur="6.151">moving on we&amp;#39;re right here this is at</text>
  <text start="214.97" dur="5.25">8:02 a.m. think Forbidden City which is</text>
  <text start="217.25" dur="6.18">in Beijing China president never crossed</text>
