  <text start="39.71" dur="4.83">Sir Patrick Mak boys and girls we may</text>
  <text start="42.62" dur="5.099">not know everything that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="44.54" dur="6.109">right now but I know one thing actors</text>
  <text start="47.719" dur="2.93">are acting</text>
  <text start="53.43" dur="5.37">[Music]</text>
  <text start="56.55" dur="3.21">some of us better than others a yes I</text>
  <text start="58.8" dur="3.21">want to take you over here to the</text>
  <text start="59.76" dur="4.11">Twitter page of a me try Stein who</text>
  <text start="62.01" dur="3.81">posted this many of you may have seen</text>
  <text start="63.87" dur="4.23">this already this is courtesy of a Daily</text>
  <text start="65.82" dur="3.93">Mail TV FBI agents and members of a</text>
  <text start="68.1" dur="3.45">Justice Department Task Force are</text>
  <text start="69.75" dur="4.53">searching Jeffrey Epstein&amp;#39;s home in the</text>
  <text start="71.55" dur="6.12">US Virgin Islands how about that so now</text>
  <text start="74.28" dur="5.55">that Jeffrey Epstein is no mo it looks</text>
  <text start="77.67" dur="5.51">like we can put foot on the island there</text>
  <text start="79.83" dur="6">so is this a recovery process is this a</text>
  <text start="83.18" dur="4.63">cleanup process is this a cover-up</text>
  <text start="85.83" dur="4.26">process not really sure but I would</text>
  <text start="87.81" dur="3.54">imagine that you know if the FBI really</text>
  <text start="90.09" dur="2.43">wanted to keep this quiet they would</text>
  <text start="91.35" dur="2.64">have done a better job than they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="92.52" dur="3.66">doing so it looks to me like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="3.45">probably recovering some evidence and</text>
  <text start="96.18" dur="3.84">there you can see so it looks to be some</text>
  <text start="97.44" dur="5.52">snorklers in the area there and this was</text>
  <text start="100.02" dur="5.34">actually taken by an anonymous civilian</text>
  <text start="102.96" dur="3.48">that claimed this but I would imagine</text>
  <text start="105.36" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re looking for some sort of</text>
  <text start="106.44" dur="3.78">submarine engine seized and whatnot if</text>
  <text start="108.57" dur="3.87">you remember Ghislaine Maxwell had a</text>
  <text start="110.22" dur="3.75">little series of two or subs and they</text>
  <text start="112.44" dur="3.959">were running these little Disney cruises</text>
  <text start="113.97" dur="3.929">over to the island back in the day right</text>
  <text start="116.399" dur="3.181">and so I imagine they&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="117.899" dur="2.911">looking for some evidence underground as</text>
  <text start="119.58" dur="3.69">a matter of fact there&amp;#39;s a picture right</text>
  <text start="120.81" dur="5.52">there of a sub that was allegedly built</text>
  <text start="123.27" dur="5.189">for uh Stephen Hawking how about that</text>
  <text start="126.33" dur="3.78">so what&amp;#39;s going on on the island well</text>
  <text start="128.459" dur="4.201">keep in mind there was a safe recovered</text>
  <text start="130.11" dur="5.4">from his East Side mansion in New York</text>
  <text start="132.66" dur="4.89">and that had diamonds had tons of cash</text>
  <text start="135.51" dur="4.59">tons of pictures who knows what else</text>
  <text start="137.55" dur="4.26">there was the expired passport lots and</text>
  <text start="140.1" dur="3.359">lots of stuff so who knows what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="141.81" dur="3.99">gonna be able to recover from this</text>
  <text start="143.459" dur="3.991">island but it&amp;#39;s very interesting that we</text>

  <text start="497.37" dur="4.38">really buying what the Warren Commission</text>
  <text start="498.96" dur="4.98">was putting down well here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="501.75" dur="6.03">connection here is that we see that our</text>

  <text start="528.42" dur="5.43">death there was no suggestion that this</text>
  <text start="530.58" dur="5.1">was a homicide all right now I want to</text>
  <text start="533.85" dur="3.57">get away from Michael Baden badan in</text>

  <text start="538.83" dur="4.47">understanding of who this guy really is</text>
  <text start="540.72" dur="4.65">because I do think it is important now</text>
  <text start="543.3" dur="5.43">not only was he present for the autopsy</text>
  <text start="545.37" dur="5.52">of JFK he was the one that sold the</text>

  <text start="556.95" dur="3.3">theory and that&amp;#39;s kind of what it really</text>
  <text start="558.57" dur="4.23">came down to right but this was a very</text>
  <text start="560.25" dur="3.96">important part of the Warren Commission</text>
  <text start="562.8" dur="3.99">even though they tried to downplay that</text>
  <text start="564.21" dur="4.41">and there&amp;#39;s an the younger Michael Baden</text>

  <text start="612.32" dur="4.71">go in and talk to whomever they are</text>
  <text start="614.93" dur="4.05">going to interview and it&amp;#39;s rehearsed</text>
  <text start="617.03" dur="4.74">and rehearsed and rehearsed and then</text>
  <text start="618.98" dur="4.56">they put it on camera now people down</text>
  <text start="621.77" dur="4.71">south don&amp;#39;t realize that man and</text>
  <text start="623.54" dur="5.07">apparently most of the people in America</text>
  <text start="626.48" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t realize that this is not a</text>
  <text start="628.61" dur="5.25">spontaneous thing that it is just as</text>
  <text start="631.34" dur="5.7">much rehearsed as any play or any</text>
  <text start="633.86" dur="6.39">anything could be now I cannot see if it</text>
  <text start="637.04" dur="5.19">were a spontaneous operation if they</text>
  <text start="640.25" dur="5.16">were sitting there and asking these</text>
  <text start="642.23" dur="4.29">people questions spontaneously like you</text>
  <text start="645.41" dur="3.93">and I are talking</text>
  <text start="646.52" dur="5.4">I could see much more reason for now the</text>
  <text start="649.34" dur="5.16">American people are sick and fed up with</text>
  <text start="651.92" dur="5.07">Watergate and they don&amp;#39;t want to hear</text>
  <text start="654.5" dur="4.65">about it anymore and they have cut all</text>
  <text start="656.99" dur="3.66">of their programs off especially down</text>
  <text start="659.15" dur="4.11">here in the south they couldn&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="660.65" dur="4.11">less there are only two people I mean</text>
  <text start="663.26" dur="2.31">two cities that are keeping this thing</text>
  <text start="664.76" dur="3.51">going</text>
  <text start="665.57" dur="5.43">plus the press and that&amp;#39;s Washington in</text>
  <text start="668.27" dur="4.02">New York and our outside of Washington</text>
  <text start="671" dur="2.73">New York you don&amp;#39;t hear about the</text>
  <text start="672.29" dur="4.05">Watergate O&amp;#39;s and when I pick up your</text>
  <text start="673.73" dur="4.77">papers down here I pick up magazines</text>
  <text start="676.34" dur="4.41">with southern letters people from the</text>
  <text start="678.5" dur="5.1">south is written in letters we&amp;#39;re sick</text>
  <text start="680.75" dur="5.4">of the Watergate shut the mess up so</text>
  <text start="683.6" dur="5.88">what what they did into me in California</text>
  <text start="686.15" dur="5.64">was a heck of a lot worse than any water</text>
  <text start="689.48" dur="4.44">body breaking into Democratic</text>
  <text start="691.79" dur="5.37">headquarters they didn&amp;#39;t steal anything</text>
  <text start="693.92" dur="5.4">they didn&amp;#39;t hurt anybody they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="697.16" dur="4.49">kidnap anybody I was kidnapped</text>
  <text start="699.32" dur="5.94">okay you just watched an interview from</text>
  <text start="701.65" dur="4.99">1973 from Martha Mitchell and I do want</text>
  <text start="705.26" dur="2.76">to talk a little bit about Martha</text>
  <text start="706.64" dur="3.39">Mitchell because she&amp;#39;s quite a deep</text>
  <text start="708.02" dur="3.54">character herself we won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="710.03" dur="4.29">cover at all in this video but she&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="711.56" dur="4.95">very important character and back in the</text>
  <text start="714.32" dur="4.86">day she was also contradicting this</text>
  <text start="716.51" dur="4.92">Magic Bullet theory according to</text>
  <text start="719.18" dur="4.29">Michael Baden ban right so who was</text>
  <text start="721.43" dur="4.11">Martha Mitchell well she didn&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="723.47" dur="4.23">from unnecessarily that influential of a</text>
  <text start="725.54" dur="5.22">family but somehow she found herself</text>
  <text start="727.7" dur="5.7">into some influential circles including</text>
  <text start="730.76" dur="4.77">the Rockefellers back in the day as a</text>
  <text start="733.4" dur="4.2">matter of fact she ended up marrying</text>
  <text start="735.53" dur="4.68">John Mitchell and John Mitchell was the</text>
  <text start="737.6" dur="5.46">former US Attorney General and of course</text>
  <text start="740.21" dur="4.74">this was the Watergate times that this</text>
  <text start="743.06" dur="3.75">was going on as a matter of fact John</text>
  <text start="744.95" dur="3.81">and Martha Mitchell lived at the</text>
  <text start="746.81" dur="4.2">Watergate Hotel and of course the</text>
  <text start="748.76" dur="5.04">Watergate Watergate Hotel complex was</text>
  <text start="751.01" dur="5.73">where the offices of the DNC had been</text>
  <text start="753.8" dur="5.61">broken into right so she seemed to know</text>
  <text start="756.74" dur="5.43">quite a few things and she ended up</text>
  <text start="759.41" dur="6.39">getting herself a job along the way</text>
  <text start="762.17" dur="6.66">somehow at Pine Bluff Arkansas she had</text>
  <text start="765.8" dur="5.57">also dated Al Capone&amp;#39;s son Sonny Capone</text>
  <text start="768.83" dur="5.64">and she was a member of the female</text>
  <text start="771.37" dur="4.81">Society of the Skull and Bones so I</text>
  <text start="774.47" dur="3.99">think you see where we&amp;#39;re going with</text>
  <text start="776.18" dur="4.74">this but she began her work as a</text>
  <text start="778.46" dur="5.18">classified top-secret secretary or a</text>
  <text start="780.92" dur="5.52">research analyst at the Pine Bluff our</text>
  <text start="783.64" dur="5.32">Arsenal in Arkansas Jefferson County for</text>
  <text start="786.44" dur="5.07">the u.s. chemical corn at the time she</text>
  <text start="788.96" dur="5.04">would have had a security clearance even</text>
  <text start="791.51" dur="5.55">higher than say like President Truman so</text>
  <text start="794" dur="4.92">this was a well-connected lady right now</text>
  <text start="797.06" dur="4.5">Martha Mitchell was very familiar with</text>
  <text start="798.92" dur="3.99">all sorts of chemical warfare and things</text>
  <text start="801.56" dur="3.54">like that as a matter of fact she was</text>
  <text start="802.91" dur="4.65">very pretty to what was going on with</text>
  <text start="805.1" dur="5.55">things such as Operation Paperclip and</text>
  <text start="807.56" dur="4.74">whatnot and she was a close assistant to</text>
  <text start="810.65" dur="5.46">military commander Brigadier General</text>
  <text start="812.3" dur="5.31">Augustine Mitchell Prentice and she</text>
  <text start="816.11" dur="3.12">followed him around for quite a bit so</text>
  <text start="817.61" dur="4.65">she knew a lot of what was going on she</text>
  <text start="819.23" dur="5.13">ended up remarrying marrying an army</text>
  <text start="822.26" dur="4.44">intelligence officer captain Clyde J</text>
  <text start="824.36" dur="4.83">Jennings and that was also in Pine Bluff</text>
  <text start="826.7" dur="5.19">so this woman became very very</text>
  <text start="829.19" dur="4.68">influential and after that marriage she</text>
  <text start="831.89" dur="4.56">got out of the military and started to</text>
  <text start="833.87" dur="4.41">get into the DC circles and that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="836.45" dur="4.17">she started running with the crew of</text>
  <text start="838.28" dur="5.58">people like Vere Maxwell from V ro</text>
  <text start="840.62" dur="6.54">sportswear this really goes way way back</text>
  <text start="843.86" dur="4.95">but my point is with all of this is that</text>
  <text start="847.16" dur="2.63">she was one of the originals to claim to</text>
  <text start="848.81" dur="3.98">have been a</text>
  <text start="849.79" dur="6.09">MK ULTRA victim very much like other</text>
  <text start="852.79" dur="4.68">people like Grace Kelly Vere Maxwell was</text>
  <text start="855.88" dur="4.11">rumored to be a handler these are things</text>
  <text start="857.47" dur="4.74">that they spoke of there were all sorts</text>
  <text start="859.99" dur="4.62">of influential circles that these people</text>
  <text start="862.21" dur="4.17">were rolling with and we know a lot of</text>
  <text start="864.61" dur="4.98">these people aristotle onassis</text>
  <text start="866.38" dur="5.42">geeta Rothschild Nelson Rockefeller all</text>
  <text start="869.59" dur="5.4">these people who have been kind of</text>
  <text start="871.8" dur="4.18">keeping this entire MKULTRA thing going</text>
  <text start="874.99" dur="3.6">for so long</text>
  <text start="875.98" dur="5.25">the perón&amp;#39;s out there in Argentina right</text>
  <text start="878.59" dur="4.59">so my point is to get you kind of</text>
  <text start="881.23" dur="4.02">acquainted with who she was what she was</text>
  <text start="883.18" dur="4.41">all about but at the end of the day she</text>
  <text start="885.25" dur="4.74">came out saying that she wasn&amp;#39;t MKULTRA</text>
  <text start="887.59" dur="3.99">victim she spoke out against the Warren</text>
  <text start="889.99" dur="3.72">Commission and she spoke out about a lot</text>
  <text start="891.58" dur="3.63">of things and they ended up drugging her</text>
  <text start="893.71" dur="3.09">up she was speaking out against</text>
  <text start="895.21" dur="3.45">Watergate matter of fact it was Nixon</text>
  <text start="896.8" dur="3.75">himself who had said had it not been</text>
  <text start="898.66" dur="3.93">from Martha Mitchell there would be no</text>
  <text start="900.55" dur="4.23">Watergate so obviously this woman was</text>
  <text start="902.59" dur="4.65">super connected and here she was saying</text>
  <text start="904.78" dur="3.81">that she was this MKULTRA victim she</text>
  <text start="907.24" dur="3.06">actually used those words and of course</text>
  <text start="908.59" dur="5.52">back then nobody knew about this stuff</text>
  <text start="910.3" dur="6.42">so she was one of the oh geez now at the</text>
  <text start="914.11" dur="5.25">time of Watergate Nixon had approved</text>
  <text start="916.72" dur="5.04">24-hour protection for Martha Mitchell</text>
  <text start="919.36" dur="6.84">and at the time her husband John</text>
  <text start="921.76" dur="6.42">Mitchell and it was June 1972 where</text>
  <text start="926.2" dur="4.62">Martha Mitchell had evidently been</text>
  <text start="928.18" dur="5.46">trying to make a phone call when someone</text>
  <text start="930.82" dur="5.67">broke into her hotel room in Newport</text>
  <text start="933.64" dur="5.61">Beach that man turned out to be former</text>
  <text start="936.49" dur="6.21">FBI agent Stephen King who is now trump</text>
  <text start="939.25" dur="5.13">appointed US Czech ambassador so he</text>
  <text start="942.7" dur="3.87">ripped the telephone out of the wall she</text>
  <text start="944.38" dur="4.08">was trying to make a call and she was</text>
  <text start="946.57" dur="4.11">saying that they were trying to drunk</text>
  <text start="948.46" dur="3.72">her up and institutionalize her she was</text>
  <text start="950.68" dur="4.71">panicking and making this call and</text>
  <text start="952.18" dur="4.95">evidently Stephen King was the one who</text>
  <text start="955.39" dur="4.38">rushed in to try and stop this keep in</text>
  <text start="957.13" dur="5.55">mind he was in the FBI at the time so</text>
  <text start="959.77" dur="5.31">this man who came to check out this</text>
  <text start="962.68" dur="5.7">situation was named dr. Dan romaine</text>
  <text start="965.08" dur="5.31">Kirkham he was a doctor in his office</text>
  <text start="968.38" dur="4.74">was nearby he came to check on this</text>
  <text start="970.39" dur="5.22">situation and he gave mrs. Mitchell a</text>
  <text start="973.12" dur="6.12">tranquilizer shot this is all according</text>
  <text start="975.61" dur="5.85">to Barbara Mitchell now this guy dr. Dan</text>
  <text start="979.24" dur="3.8">romaine Kirkham he turned out to be</text>
  <text start="981.46" dur="5.299">super sue</text>
  <text start="983.04" dur="5.88">right wing and in 2005 he was convicted</text>
  <text start="986.759" dur="5.19">on federal charges of conspiracy to</text>
  <text start="988.92" dur="4.8">defraud the IRS so this gets really</text>
  <text start="991.949" dur="3.121">really crazy now we know a lot of this</text>
  <text start="993.72" dur="3.33">information because of an interview that</text>
  <text start="995.07" dur="3.329">she gave with Marcia Kramer who at the</text>
  <text start="997.05" dur="3.45">time was working for The Associated</text>
  <text start="998.399" dur="4.56">Press and she found her at the</text>
  <text start="1000.5" dur="4.019">Westchester New York country club this</text>
  <text start="1002.959" dur="3.421">is where she gave the interview about</text>
  <text start="1004.519" dur="4.231">what happened to her she was talking</text>
  <text start="1006.38" dur="5.399">about MKULTRA monarch and how she was</text>
  <text start="1008.75" dur="5.04">brainwashed well shortly after this she</text>
  <text start="1011.779" dur="4.05">disappeared and the idea was that John</text>
  <text start="1013.79" dur="4.62">Mitchell had actually caught up to her</text>
  <text start="1015.829" dur="5.49">at the time and they took her over to</text>
  <text start="1018.41" dur="5.01">the Essex House Hotel in New York and</text>
  <text start="1021.319" dur="4.411">this is where she said that a lot of the</text>
  <text start="1023.42" dur="4.59">MKULTRA monarch stuff was going on the</text>
  <text start="1025.73" dur="5.189">brainwashing was going on here at the</text>
  <text start="1028.01" dur="5.49">Essex House Hotel we also know that her</text>
  <text start="1030.919" dur="5.191">kidnapping story seems to add up because</text>
  <text start="1033.5" dur="5.22">we heard this in the testimony of James</text>
  <text start="1036.11" dur="5.25">McCord jr. who was employed as chief of</text>
  <text start="1038.72" dur="5.16">security for John Mitchell and he was</text>
  <text start="1041.36" dur="5.76">part of this creep program which was</text>
  <text start="1043.88" dur="5.52">basically keeping Richard Nixon elected</text>
  <text start="1047.12" dur="4.37">that was a whole secret project that</text>
  <text start="1049.4" dur="4.529">they were working on but he stated in</text>
  <text start="1051.49" dur="4.9">1975 after he was convicted of</text>
  <text start="1053.929" dur="4.951">conspiracy in Watergate he admitted that</text>
  <text start="1056.39" dur="4.98">he had been not only her bodyguard but</text>
  <text start="1058.88" dur="5.49">basically the woman had been kidnapped</text>
  <text start="1061.37" dur="5.73">by the CIA and that she had last been</text>
  <text start="1064.37" dur="4.65">seen at the Westchester New York country</text>
  <text start="1067.1" dur="3.959">club now I could go on forever about</text>
  <text start="1069.02" dur="4.11">Martha Mitchell but I want to stop right</text>
  <text start="1071.059" dur="4.891">there at the New York&amp;#39;s Essex House</text>
  <text start="1073.13" dur="5.13">Hotel this was the hotel that Mitchell</text>
  <text start="1075.95" dur="4.38">claimed a lot of the MKULTRA programming</text>
  <text start="1078.26" dur="6.06">was going on at well a few years later</text>
  <text start="1080.33" dur="6.599">in 1979 an extremely talented singer</text>
  <text start="1084.32" dur="5.97">Donny Hathaway fell from the window of</text>
  <text start="1086.929" dur="6.331">his 15th floor room the very same hotel</text>
  <text start="1090.29" dur="5.369">he was 33 years old on a top in the</text>
  <text start="1093.26" dur="3.93">world of time and he was not just a</text>
  <text start="1095.659" dur="4.231">talented singer he was a bit of an</text>
  <text start="1097.19" dur="6.09">activist and it was rumored that the FBI</text>
  <text start="1099.89" dur="5.85">was keeping tabs on him by way of Co</text>
  <text start="1103.28" dur="3.6">Intel program under a particular program</text>
  <text start="1105.74" dur="3.39">when I kind of talk about it much today</text>
  <text start="1106.88" dur="3.57">called Black Messiah but if you want to</text>
  <text start="1109.13" dur="3.81">know more about that story about Donny</text>
  <text start="1110.45" dur="4.05">Hathaway I would search black messiah</text>
  <text start="1112.94" dur="3.329">but once again here we have this</text>
  <text start="1114.5" dur="5.07">talented well-connected dude</text>
  <text start="1116.269" dur="6.24">top of the world and commits suicide at</text>
  <text start="1119.57" dur="5.729">this very same hotel donny hathaway was</text>
  <text start="1122.509" dur="5.16">also known to be a drug user which kind</text>
  <text start="1125.299" dur="5.07">of fits the MK ULTRA description right</text>
  <text start="1127.669" dur="4.68">but the real kicker is that the night</text>
  <text start="1130.369" dur="4.35">that he died they actually had to cancel</text>
  <text start="1132.349" dur="4.32">his recording session and this is</text>
  <text start="1134.719" dur="3.78">according to fellow musician james</text>
  <text start="1136.669" dur="5.281">matoom a who was at the recording studio</text>
  <text start="1138.499" dur="5.46">who had said that Hathaway was fine for</text>
  <text start="1141.95" dur="3.899">a while and then just started screaming</text>
  <text start="1143.959" dur="4.47">and when they asked him what was wrong</text>
  <text start="1145.849" dur="5.76">he said that white people were trying to</text>
  <text start="1148.429" dur="5.16">kill him and had connected his brain to</text>
  <text start="1151.609" dur="5.64">a machine for the purpose of stealing</text>
  <text start="1153.589" dur="5.4">his music how about that</text>
  <text start="1157.249" dur="4.5">now keep in mind at the time that Donnie</text>
  <text start="1158.989" dur="6.93">was killed the chief medical examiner of</text>
  <text start="1161.749" dur="10.11">New York City was dr. Michael M Bannon</text>
  <text start="1165.919" dur="8.73">Baden no right but wait a minute it gets</text>
  <text start="1171.859" dur="7.29">weirder so Hathaway was found dead on</text>
  <text start="1174.649" dur="8.7">the 15th of January 1979 right well on</text>
  <text start="1179.149" dur="6.48">the 26th of January 1979 Nelson</text>
  <text start="1183.349" dur="3.66">Rockefeller for term governor of the</text>
  <text start="1185.629" dur="2.821">state of New York and former vice</text>
  <text start="1187.009" dur="4.441">president of the United States of</text>
  <text start="1188.45" dur="5.49">America was also found dead due to an</text>
  <text start="1191.45" dur="3.899">apparent heart attack now he was found</text>
  <text start="1193.94" dur="4.919">in an apartment building called the</text>
  <text start="1195.349" dur="6.42">Regent house at 25 West 54th Street in</text>
  <text start="1198.859" dur="6.56">Manhattan and that apartment belonged to</text>
  <text start="1201.769" dur="8.13">a 22 year old blond assistant named</text>
  <text start="1205.419" dur="6.76">Megan Marshack another suspected MKULTRA</text>
  <text start="1209.899" dur="3.9">victim and the reason why we think that</text>

  <text start="1258.43" dur="5.62">reported to had seen the story of Martha</text>
  <text start="1261.5" dur="5.82">Mitchell and her little attack at the</text>
  <text start="1264.05" dur="5.16">new Porter in there was Douglas Ross he</text>
  <text start="1267.32" dur="4.8">was the manager of the new Porter and</text>
  <text start="1269.21" dur="4.89">evidently he knew the entire story about</text>
  <text start="1272.12" dur="5.1">the attack well he suffered a cerebral</text>
  <text start="1274.1" dur="5.49">hemorrhage in the hotel kitchen how</text>
  <text start="1277.22" dur="5.24">about that also during the time of the</text>
  <text start="1279.59" dur="5.85">Watergate scandal mrs. Louise Boyer and</text>
  <text start="1282.46" dur="5.32">she was Lawrence Rockefellers assistant</text>

  <text start="1290.09" dur="4.77">and that was in 1974 now I want to talk</text>
  <text start="1293.12" dur="3.93">about one more house and that is the</text>
  <text start="1294.86" dur="5.73">Odyssey house that was founded by Judy</text>
  <text start="1297.05" dur="6.51">and ensign Garber of Manhattan and she</text>

  <text start="1305.15" dur="4.05">addicts prostitutes and sexually abused</text>
  <text start="1307.25" dur="4.65">children so I think you see where we</text>
  <text start="1309.2" dur="4.56">might be going with this right if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1311.9" dur="4.23">watched any of my videos over the last</text>
  <text start="1313.76" dur="4.11">year or so you know that a lot of these</text>
  <text start="1316.13" dur="4.32">programs for drug addicts prostitutes</text>
  <text start="1317.87" dur="5.28">and sexually abused children usually end</text>
  <text start="1320.45" dur="5.31">up in more drug addicts prostitutes and</text>
  <text start="1323.15" dur="4.68">sexually abused children if not MKULTRA</text>
  <text start="1325.76" dur="4.14">type victims right well it sounds like</text>
  <text start="1327.83" dur="3.66">the odyssey house was none other and she</text>
  <text start="1329.9" dur="3.69">actually fought off quite a bit of</text>
  <text start="1331.49" dur="4.38">claims of child pornography and</text>
  <text start="1333.59" dur="4.29">prostitution she battled with this the</text>

  <text start="1343.07" dur="5.7">very wealthy family Gustav and Beatrice</text>
