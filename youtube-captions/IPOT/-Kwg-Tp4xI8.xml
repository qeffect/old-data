  <text start="363.75" dur="4.68">car and it seems like everything started</text>
  <text start="366.09" dur="4.62">to happen just as she had announced that</text>
  <text start="368.43" dur="4.32">she couldn&amp;#39;t find this rental car so she</text>

  <text start="372.75" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t really know but I also want to</text>
  <text start="374.61" dur="3.9">plug in your head that she was an app</text>
  <text start="376.47" dur="4.5">person so I would assume she&amp;#39;d be pretty</text>
  <text start="378.51" dur="4.35">savvy with apps and I would assume that</text>
  <text start="380.97" dur="3.93">her family was pretty savvy with apps</text>
  <text start="382.86" dur="3.54">attempts to locate her through five my</text>

  <text start="434.31" dur="2.139">late in the week before returning last</text>
  <text start="436.11" dur="2.35">we</text>
  <text start="436.449" dur="4.261">get into the Bay Area to reconnect with</text>

  <text start="442.99" dur="4.56">from the nest Hotel in Palo Alto on</text>
  <text start="445.479" dur="4.141">Monday afternoon there&amp;#39;s never any</text>
  <text start="447.55" dur="5.009">history of anything like this no mental</text>
  <text start="449.62" dur="5.49">health diagnosis no hospitalization no</text>
  <text start="452.559" dur="3.66">substance use no arrests as clear of a</text>
  <text start="455.11" dur="3.239">record as you can get</text>
  <text start="456.219" dur="3.901">this is incredibly unlike her he said</text>
  <text start="458.349" dur="4.051">during the search she is an extremely</text>
  <text start="460.12" dur="4.68">high achievement successful person okay</text>
  <text start="462.4" dur="4.71">so as of now I don&amp;#39;t have a whole lot of</text>
  <text start="464.8" dur="3.75">definitive --zz here but this is an odd</text>
  <text start="467.11" dur="3.54">story and I have a feeling there might</text>
  <text start="468.55" dur="4.799">be more to this story</text>
  <text start="470.65" dur="5.519">we&amp;#39;re over again the googly maps and in</text>
  <text start="473.349" dur="5.011">your top left corner up here you can</text>
  <text start="476.169" dur="4.47">even see right here this ping is Sand</text>
  <text start="478.36" dur="4.589">Hill School and this road right here is</text>
  <text start="480.639" dur="5.28">Sand Hill Road Road so this is where the</text>
  <text start="482.949" dur="5.25">call went out where she was looking for</text>
  <text start="485.919" dur="4.86">her car misses up here in West Menlo</text>
  <text start="488.199" dur="5.19">Park not near where she was found</text>
  <text start="490.779" dur="6.271">now down in the bottom right is where</text>
  <text start="493.389" dur="5.941">the medical call came in from 65 82 Bose</text>
  <text start="497.05" dur="5.16">Lane I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s Bose or Bo see</text>
  <text start="499.33" dur="4.799">maybe it&amp;#39;s Bo saying San Jose maybe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="502.21" dur="5.189">Bo saying Lane I don&amp;#39;t know but either</text>
  <text start="504.129" dur="5.731">way it&amp;#39;s both right now and that was</text>
  <text start="507.399" dur="5.87">what the call was now the car or the</text>
  <text start="509.86" dur="6.119">body was found on the 6500 block the</text>
  <text start="513.269" dur="4.421">6500 block is from here up until where</text>
  <text start="515.979" dur="5.521">this little light blue road makes a kink</text>
  <text start="517.69" dur="5.67">right so this would seem to be very very</text>
  <text start="521.5" dur="3.36">close to where this medical call was we</text>
  <text start="523.36" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t know what the medical call came</text>
  <text start="524.86" dur="4.409">from that&amp;#39;s very interesting but</text>
  <text start="527.11" dur="4.589">evidently the family must have known she</text>
  <text start="529.269" dur="3.961">was in the area because the drones were</text>
  <text start="531.699" dur="3.841">set off in the park and the park is just</text>
  <text start="533.23" dur="4.859">off your screen here now but it&amp;#39;s down</text>
  <text start="535.54" dur="3.93">south there at the Quicksilver Park so</text>
  <text start="538.089" dur="3.511">they must have known that she was in the</text>
  <text start="539.47" dur="3.54">area but a couple of other curious</text>
  <text start="541.6" dur="4.38">things that I wanted to point out is</text>
  <text start="543.01" dur="4.86">that so here&amp;#39;s this woman who can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="545.98" dur="3.75">a car I&amp;#39;m not saying she would have had</text>
  <text start="547.87" dur="3.089">an app you know to help her find her car</text>
  <text start="549.73" dur="3.15">because you still have to maybe have a</text>
  <text start="550.959" dur="5.07">connection or whatever but like I said</text>
  <text start="552.88" dur="5.49">she&amp;#39;s an app person and although the</text>
  <text start="556.029" dur="3.661">mother had said that you know she you</text>
  <text start="558.37" dur="3.63">know why can&amp;#39;t you ping this car why</text>
  <text start="559.69" dur="3.99">can&amp;#39;t you find this car I want to point</text>
  <text start="562" dur="3.81">out over here on heavy it looks like her</text>
  <text start="563.68" dur="4.589">husband said that was there was no kind</text>
  <text start="565.81" dur="4.08">of tracking device on the phone whether</text>
  <text start="568.269" dur="2.251">it be some sort of app or something like</text>
  <text start="569.89" dur="3.63">that</text>
  <text start="570.52" dur="5.1">so already I&amp;#39;m seeing a conflict of</text>
  <text start="573.52" dur="4.47">stories right there might be nothing at</text>
  <text start="575.62" dur="3.99">all might have just been an innocent you</text>
  <text start="577.99" dur="3.63">know statement but I think that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="579.61" dur="3.81">really curious now of course I think we</text>
  <text start="581.62" dur="4.02">all know that your cell phone itself</text>
  <text start="583.42" dur="4.08">pretty much is a tracking device and if</text>
  <text start="585.64" dur="3.96">you&amp;#39;re not aware of that you&amp;#39;re about 20</text>
  <text start="587.5" dur="3.78">years behind right I think we all know</text>
  <text start="589.6" dur="3.66">that as long as you got yourself a cell</text>
  <text start="591.28" dur="3.48">phone you&amp;#39;re gonna be pinged if you can</text>
  <text start="593.26" dur="3.27">access any kind of Google map or</text>
  <text start="594.76" dur="4.2">whatever and again like I said this is</text>
  <text start="596.53" dur="5.1">an app person so it seems very unusual</text>
  <text start="598.96" dur="4.32">that she really either got lost but not</text>
  <text start="601.63" dur="4.8">necessarily surprising she couldn&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="603.28" dur="5.1">her car now I do want to point out she</text>
  <text start="606.43" dur="4.74">was supposed to fly to Utah from San</text>
  <text start="608.38" dur="4.83">Jose International and that is sort of</text>
  <text start="611.17" dur="4.83">center right of your screen where my</text>
  <text start="613.21" dur="5.13">mouse is here now you can see I have two</text>
  <text start="616" dur="5.04">different routes leading to the same</text>
  <text start="618.34" dur="4.59">path she could have taken either one but</text>
  <text start="621.04" dur="5.49">if she was indeed heading to the airport</text>
  <text start="622.93" dur="6.57">she would have either gone this way and</text>
  <text start="626.53" dur="4.8">taken some sort of other you know other</text>
  <text start="629.5" dur="3.87">stop maybe before the airport which is</text>
  <text start="631.33" dur="4.11">very possible but if she had gone this</text>
  <text start="633.37" dur="4.41">way she would have gone right past the</text>
  <text start="635.44" dur="4.14">airport so this all seems very very</text>
  <text start="637.78" dur="3.84">strange and again we&amp;#39;re here in another</text>
  <text start="639.58" dur="3.36">residence so it would suggest to me if</text>
  <text start="641.62" dur="3.77">she was visiting a friend up here to</text>
  <text start="642.94" dur="5.1">residence near Stanford University and</text>
  <text start="645.39" dur="4.57">then of course down here in another area</text>
  <text start="648.04" dur="3.75">of residence maybe she was visiting</text>
  <text start="649.96" dur="4.23">another friend or she got herself</text>
  <text start="651.79" dur="4.89">diverted right past the airport which is</text>
  <text start="654.19" dur="4.77">also possible also keep in mind going</text>
  <text start="656.68" dur="4.65">this way right smack dab in the center</text>
  <text start="658.96" dur="4.44">of your screen is the Apple Campus at</text>
  <text start="661.33" dur="3.99">Cupertino so as for those of you who</text>
  <text start="663.4" dur="4.26">know this is Northern California so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="665.32" dur="3.9">obviously very very techie all the way</text>
  <text start="667.66" dur="3.69">around so this can be a frustrating</text>
  <text start="669.22" dur="4.86">situation because when you have an adult</text>
  <text start="671.35" dur="3.93">missing unless it&amp;#39;s 24 hours you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="674.08" dur="3.39">usually going to have a hard time</text>
  <text start="675.28" dur="3.66">getting any kind of law enforcement to</text>
  <text start="677.47" dur="3.45">move on this because they can&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="678.94" dur="3.27">file a missing-persons report at least</text>
  <text start="680.92" dur="3.33">for them the best that I can understand</text>
  <text start="682.21" dur="5.31">until 24 hours particularly if it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="684.25" dur="6.15">adult but the family was immediately on</text>
  <text start="687.52" dur="5.07">this they set up a Facebook page they</text>
  <text start="690.4" dur="3.33">set up you know a couple of obviously</text>
  <text start="692.59" dur="2.61">they sound like tech people so they</text>
  <text start="693.73" dur="3.96">probably immediately went to what they</text>
  <text start="695.2" dur="6.06">knew right but the family knew something</text>
  <text start="697.69" dur="5.64">was up and here she is a psychologist as</text>
  <text start="701.26" dur="3.269">well as a what seems to be kind of a bit</text>
  <text start="703.33" dur="3.12">of a tecmo</text>
  <text start="704.529" dur="4.111">maybe not super big-time but she was</text>
  <text start="706.45" dur="4.86">very very accomplished and her husband</text>
  <text start="708.64" dur="4.98">was also a psychologist in the Salt Lake</text>
  <text start="711.31" dur="4.17">City area so you would think these</text>
  <text start="713.62" dur="3.45">people would be a fairly stable mind and</text>
  <text start="715.48" dur="3.39">that&amp;#39;s of course what the family is</text>
  <text start="717.07" dur="4.019">saying this is way way out of character</text>
  <text start="718.87" dur="4.35">for her to start talking all kind of</text>
  <text start="721.089" dur="4.68">crazy stuff and I find it very curious</text>
  <text start="723.22" dur="5.369">that as an app maker somebody who is</text>
  <text start="725.769" dur="6.57">constantly accessing other people&amp;#39;s data</text>
  <text start="728.589" dur="4.921">would be talking about something as what</text>
  <text start="732.339" dur="3.93">some people would think would be crazy</text>
  <text start="733.51" dur="5.43">like the matrix and whatnot living in</text>
  <text start="736.269" dur="5.371">the matrix well we&amp;#39;re back on heavy calm</text>
  <text start="738.94" dur="5.459">the woman tech council described her</text>
  <text start="741.64" dur="4.77">work at tinker this way at tinker erin</text>
  <text start="744.399" dur="4.44">manages a global team of 120 employees</text>
  <text start="746.41" dur="4.98">across their Salt Lake City and Lahore</text>
  <text start="748.839" dur="5.821">Pakistan offices tinker has built over</text>
  <text start="751.39" dur="5.819">700 products including mobile apps SaaS</text>
  <text start="754.66" dur="4.56">applications tech enabled marketplaces</text>
  <text start="757.209" dur="3.781">and consumer websites okay well she may</text>
  <text start="759.22" dur="3.63">not be a tech giant but that sounds</text>
  <text start="760.99" dur="3.48">pretty accomplished to me the council</text>
  <text start="762.85" dur="4.65">added that Valente had worked for brands</text>
  <text start="764.47" dur="6.72">including Facebook Skull Candy Live</text>
  <text start="767.5" dur="4.769">Nation Pearson metro pcs and several</text>
  <text start="771.19" dur="2.91">emerging startups</text>
  <text start="772.269" dur="3.151">she is currently focused on developing</text>
  <text start="774.1" dur="3.84">software and product development</text>
  <text start="775.42" dur="4.32">development training programs rapidly</text>
  <text start="777.94" dur="3.57">scaling revenue and launching a web</text>
  <text start="779.74" dur="3.9">content series on innovation and</text>
  <text start="781.51" dur="3.93">creativity alright she sounded busy</text>
  <text start="783.64" dur="4.62">before starting tinker Valente was</text>
  <text start="785.44" dur="4.8">founder and CEO of SLC tech startups in</text>
  <text start="788.26" dur="4.079">Salt Lake City which she described as a</text>
  <text start="790.24" dur="4.56">startup and technology focused meetup</text>
  <text start="792.339" dur="4.651">group before that she was executive in</text>
  <text start="794.8" dur="3.09">residence for mindshare ventures in Park</text>
  <text start="796.99" dur="2.67">City Utah</text>
  <text start="797.89" dur="5.639">and director of product development for</text>
  <text start="799.66" dur="7.98">overstock.com this is my chair over here</text>
  <text start="803.529" dur="6.12">and her tinkerer was part of this again</text>
  <text start="807.64" dur="4.65">I don&amp;#39;t see anything unusual it just</text>
  <text start="809.649" dur="4.411">looks like another tech startup here but</text>
  <text start="812.29" dur="4.409">I did want to point out that this is</text>
  <text start="814.06" dur="5.07">tinkers logo right there and of course</text>
  <text start="816.699" dur="4.801">that logo with the little triangle</text>
  <text start="819.13" dur="5.28">inside the eye and a squared circle idea</text>
  <text start="821.5" dur="5.16">and I&amp;#39;m just saying but other than that</text>
  <text start="824.41" dur="4.2">really this just looks like another tech</text>
  <text start="826.66" dur="3.81">startup right well I have a feeling that</text>
  <text start="828.61" dur="2.25">there&amp;#39;s more to this Valente than meets</text>
  <text start="830.47" dur="2.609">the eye</text>
  <text start="830.86" dur="4.26">she seems like quite a talented person</text>
  <text start="833.079" dur="4.831">and she&amp;#39;s got her fingers in quite a few</text>
  <text start="835.12" dur="5.58">pies for three years she was founder and</text>
  <text start="837.91" dur="5.4">CEO of sky crane incorporated described</text>
  <text start="840.7" dur="4.29">as a online work-for-hire marketplace</text>
  <text start="843.31" dur="4.11">where businesses can buy on-demand</text>
  <text start="844.99" dur="4.77">administrative support back-office and</text>
  <text start="847.42" dur="6">marketing service but this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="849.76" dur="6.12">curious to me Valente also worked as an</text>
  <text start="853.42" dur="4.32">investment professional for summit</text>
  <text start="855.88" dur="5.01">partners of venture capital and private</text>
  <text start="857.74" dur="5.61">equity fund in palo alto california and</text>
  <text start="860.89" dur="7.17">as a financial analyst for Bonaventure</text>
  <text start="863.35" dur="6.9">Realty Group LLC in Washington DC okay</text>
  <text start="868.06" dur="6.45">so this Valente is a psychologist and</text>
  <text start="870.25" dur="6.3">she is an app mogul if you will she also</text>
  <text start="874.51" dur="3.42">was an investment professional for</text>
  <text start="876.55" dur="3.96">Summit Partners which is a pretty big</text>
  <text start="877.93" dur="6.66">deal and also a financial analyst for</text>
  <text start="880.51" dur="6.33">Bonaventure Realty oh okay well let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="884.59" dur="3.93">take a look over here at Summit Partners</text>
  <text start="886.84" dur="4.08">because this is where it starts to get</text>
  <text start="888.52" dur="4.89">really really curious broad and deep</text>
  <text start="890.92" dur="3.92">industry experience for more than 35</text>
  <text start="893.41" dur="3.75">years we&amp;#39;ve been helping companies</text>
  <text start="894.84" dur="4.81">accelerate their growth in three key</text>
  <text start="897.16" dur="4.05">sectors and remember she was advising on</text>
  <text start="899.65" dur="3.21">their financials meaning their</text>
  <text start="901.21" dur="3.45">investments so she would have known</text>
  <text start="902.86" dur="4.11">about a lot of these companies that were</text>
  <text start="904.66" dur="3.9">that summit partners was associating</text>
  <text start="906.97" dur="4.17">themselves with and there&amp;#39;s some curious</text>
  <text start="908.56" dur="4.98">companies indeed let&amp;#39;s dig into these</text>
  <text start="911.14" dur="5.4">tech companies first TSheets founded in</text>
  <text start="913.54" dur="5.76">2006 TSheets provides cloud-based time</text>
  <text start="916.54" dur="4.83">tracking software to small and</text>
  <text start="919.3" dur="4.11">medium-sized businesses thousands of</text>

  <text start="927.37" dur="4.92">track employee time and attendance for</text>
  <text start="929.83" dur="3.9">payroll and you know this is very very</text>
  <text start="932.29" dur="2.7">interesting because a lot of these tech</text>
  <text start="933.73" dur="3.81">giants are getting into kind of stuff</text>
  <text start="934.99" dur="4.08">like this too you can even think of Jack</text>
  <text start="937.54" dur="3.87">over there Jack Dorsey from on Twitter</text>
  <text start="939.07" dur="4.23">remember him and Sue Howell rizvi went</text>

  <text start="943.3" dur="4.38">thing he&amp;#39;s got Square it&amp;#39;s a big big</text>

  <text start="947.68" dur="4.68">and mobile payments it&amp;#39;s about gathering</text>
  <text start="949.15" dur="4.68">your data in particular gathering your</text>
  <text start="952.36" dur="4.2">financial data</text>

  <text start="1196.95" dur="3.81">reason I&amp;#39;m pointing that out is if you</text>
