  <text start="37.989" dur="5.381">welcome to in pursuit of truth this is</text>
  <text start="40.219" dur="6.211">your host Sir Patrick Mak boys and girls</text>
  <text start="43.37" dur="8.459">with so much drama in the LBC it&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="46.43" dur="8.399">of hard being sir Patrick M AC K some AC</text>
  <text start="51.829" dur="6.991">K actually like Patrick M ACK today is</text>
  <text start="54.829" dur="7.83">the 17th know pretty sweet huh yeah</text>
  <text start="58.82" dur="5.43">yeah you know who else knows Joe Biden</text>
  <text start="62.659" dur="2.25">he had something to say about it check</text>
  <text start="64.25" dur="3.27">it out</text>
  <text start="64.909" dur="5.251">what I think is important is we focus on</text>
  <text start="67.52" dur="7.08">why it&amp;#39;s so important to remove this man</text>
  <text start="70.16" dur="9.209">from office on the 17th look on the</text>
  <text start="74.6" dur="9.78">serpentine Gary what we have to do now</text>
  <text start="79.369" dur="8.221">is focus on Donald Trump okay so that is</text>
  <text start="84.38" dur="5.64">mildly disturbing to say the least now</text>
  <text start="87.59" dur="4.35">if you saw the actual exchange Biden was</text>
  <text start="90.02" dur="3.81">actually deflecting about a son hunter</text>
  <text start="91.94" dur="4.02">Biden and saying how we need to focus on</text>
  <text start="93.83" dur="4.05">really getting rid of President Trump</text>
  <text start="95.96" dur="4.29">and that seems to be what prompted</text>
  <text start="97.88" dur="4.71">whatever he was gonna say about 17 or</text>
  <text start="100.25" dur="3.66">the 17th what not for those of you who</text>
  <text start="102.59" dur="3">are not understanding the reference of</text>
  <text start="103.91" dur="4.98">course the 17th letter of the alphabet</text>
  <text start="105.59" dur="4.559">is Q which is what of course a lot of us</text>
  <text start="108.89" dur="3.69">think that could be a reference to you</text>
  <text start="110.149" dur="4.321">could just be a reference to a date but</text>
  <text start="112.58" dur="4.769">either way he was referencing the 17th</text>
  <text start="114.47" dur="5.58">for something now is that a potential</text>
  <text start="117.349" dur="3.961">surprise release for the IG report not</text>
  <text start="120.05" dur="2.7">really sure but I think one of the</text>
  <text start="121.31" dur="3.21">curious things that a lot of us wanted</text>
  <text start="122.75" dur="4.41">to know is if this had anything to do</text>
  <text start="124.52" dur="4.32">with the upcoming rally for president</text>
  <text start="127.16" dur="3.12">Trump which is happening in Dallas which</text>
  <text start="128.84" dur="2.88">will be happening really really soon by</text>
  <text start="130.28" dur="2.97">the time you&amp;#39;re watching this video</text>
  <text start="131.72" dur="3.48">actually and I want to turn you on to</text>
  <text start="133.25" dur="3.9">something real quick that I found very</text>
  <text start="135.2" dur="4.53">suspicious in regards to that very</text>
  <text start="137.15" dur="4.619">notion I want to take you to this</text>
  <text start="139.73" dur="4.74">article from the New York Times from the</text>
  <text start="141.769" dur="5.311">12th entitled James nobody&amp;#39;s telling me</text>
  <text start="144.47" dur="4.32">Comey would like to help the former FBI</text>
  <text start="147.08" dur="4.17">director wants an end to the trump</text>
  <text start="148.79" dur="4.77">presidency yeah we know that and yes he</text>
  <text start="151.25" dur="3.569">knows you might think he caused it yeah</text>
  <text start="153.56" dur="3.6">we know that too</text>
  <text start="154.819" dur="4.441">so New York Times telling us a lot of</text>
  <text start="157.16" dur="4.469">what we already know but we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="159.26" dur="4.739">it&amp;#39;s why is he doing this and this</text>
  <text start="161.629" dur="6.03">particular picture was very very curious</text>
  <text start="163.999" dur="5.331">now if you&amp;#39;re new to my channel I would</text>
  <text start="167.659" dur="4.791">suggest going back through some</text>
  <text start="169.33" dur="5.31">older videos but we have talked a lot</text>
  <text start="172.45" dur="3.84">about a lot of kind of dog whistling</text>
  <text start="174.64" dur="4.05">that James Comey not just James Comey</text>
  <text start="176.29" dur="4.29">but in particular James Comey has been</text>
  <text start="178.69" dur="3.6">doing particularly on Twitter this led</text>
  <text start="180.58" dur="3.75">to a series of dog tweets and things</text>
  <text start="182.29" dur="3.57">like that all kinds of these tweets I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="184.33" dur="3.24">done multiple videos in regards to these</text>
  <text start="185.86" dur="3.87">dog tweets and I&amp;#39;ve gotten a lot of</text>
  <text start="187.57" dur="5.52">criticism on it however I will say this</text>
  <text start="189.73" dur="4.8">the confirmation that I&amp;#39;ve gotten comes</text>
  <text start="193.09" dur="4.35">from sources they&amp;#39;re far outweigh the</text>
  <text start="194.53" dur="4.89">criticism so I&amp;#39;m clearly onto something</text>
  <text start="197.44" dur="3.78">here we&amp;#39;re clearly onto something here</text>
  <text start="199.42" dur="3.36">but we&amp;#39;re not exactly sure what and I</text>
  <text start="201.22" dur="2.73">don&amp;#39;t want to play too many games with</text>
  <text start="202.78" dur="3.3">this here but I thought this was very</text>
  <text start="203.95" dur="4.14">curious now let&amp;#39;s take a look at this</text>
  <text start="206.08" dur="3.18">picture now as you can see nobody&amp;#39;s home</text>
  <text start="208.09" dur="3.06">he&amp;#39;s right there in the middle of his</text>
  <text start="209.26" dur="4.29">atrium right there in his sweet little</text>
  <text start="211.15" dur="3.72">pad and of course they went through a</text>
  <text start="213.55" dur="2.55">lot of trouble to make sure that this</text>
  <text start="214.87" dur="3.12">picture looks beautiful and it is a</text>
  <text start="216.1" dur="3.75">beautiful picture but if you&amp;#39;ll notice</text>
  <text start="217.99" dur="4.71">there on the foreground on the floor</text>
  <text start="219.85" dur="4.56">there is a series of toys and these are</text>
  <text start="222.7" dur="4.17">Star Wars toys they almost look like</text>
  <text start="224.41" dur="5.97">they might be enough they&amp;#39;re Legos but</text>
  <text start="226.87" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re Star Wars themed and James Comey</text>
  <text start="230.38" dur="3">actually tweeted about these saying they</text>
  <text start="231.91" dur="3.75">were his grandsons and he thought they</text>
  <text start="233.38" dur="4.41">looked cool so obviously he was calling</text>
  <text start="235.66" dur="4.859">attention to them now let&amp;#39;s remember</text>
  <text start="237.79" dur="4.53">that we have an event coming up in</text>
  <text start="240.519" dur="4.111">Dallas right and it&amp;#39;s gonna be later</text>
  <text start="242.32" dur="3.75">today for most of you and so we all know</text>
  <text start="244.63" dur="3.329">that something very significant happened</text>
  <text start="246.07" dur="5.94">a long long time ago with another</text>
  <text start="247.959" dur="7.5">president in Dallas and oddly enough the</text>
  <text start="252.01" dur="5.009">layout of these toys and this what you</text>
  <text start="255.459" dur="4.021">call those things the foot pillow things</text>
  <text start="257.019" dur="3.871">hammock Hasek hammock I can&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="259.48" dur="3.23">what you call those darn things the</text>
  <text start="260.89" dur="4.47">thing that you kicked your feet up on</text>
  <text start="262.71" dur="5.53">and it&amp;#39;s right here in the foreground</text>
  <text start="265.36" dur="6">here so if you&amp;#39;ll notice if you if we go</text>
  <text start="268.24" dur="4.62">back to the assassination of JFK and</text>
  <text start="271.36" dur="4.08">this might be looking a little bit ricci</text>
  <text start="272.86" dur="4.53">here but just hear me out this area</text>
  <text start="275.44" dur="5.16">would have been that little grassy knoll</text>
  <text start="277.39" dur="5.7">area and here&amp;#39;s our perfect little turn</text>
  <text start="280.6" dur="4.71">right here and if you look actually at</text>
  <text start="283.09" dur="4.38">those old pictures you&amp;#39;ll see that a lot</text>
  <text start="285.31" dur="3.84">of the press and everything was actually</text>
  <text start="287.47" dur="3.36">set up in this formation here now I</text>
  <text start="289.15" dur="3.81">might be looking way into that but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="290.83" dur="4.17">just pointing out I want to point out</text>
  <text start="292.96" dur="4.32">too that these are not just Lego Star</text>
  <text start="295" dur="3.45">Wars toys but this particular one is the</text>
  <text start="297.28" dur="3.36">I remember that</text>
  <text start="298.45" dur="5.07">the name this little rolling robot thing</text>
  <text start="300.64" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s like the modern version of r2d2 but</text>
  <text start="303.52" dur="3.18">either way then we have the Millennium</text>
  <text start="304.69" dur="3.3">Falcon here and an x-wing fighter and</text>
  <text start="306.7" dur="2.55">then what looks to be I don&amp;#39;t of Jedi&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="307.99" dur="3.27">or whatever but if you&amp;#39;re not familiar</text>
  <text start="309.25" dur="3.72">with the movie these are what are</text>
  <text start="311.26" dur="4.14">perceived in the movie as the good guys</text>
  <text start="312.97" dur="5.28">and what they are are the rebels they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="315.4" dur="4.65">the Rebel Alliance ganging up on the</text>
  <text start="318.25" dur="3.96">whole establishment which looks to be</text>
  <text start="320.05" dur="3.6">over here which might be symbolic to the</text>
  <text start="322.21" dur="3.27">Death Star and in the movie star wars</text>
  <text start="323.65" dur="4.26">but that&amp;#39;s essentially what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="325.48" dur="4.71">trying to do is to present to prevent</text>
  <text start="327.91" dur="3.96">the imperialists from completing it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="330.19" dur="3.45">Death Star and they eventually destroys</text>
  <text start="331.87" dur="3.72">the Death Star so anyway I just wanted</text>
  <text start="333.64" dur="3.66">to make those analogies right there I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="335.59" dur="3.57">not saying that that&amp;#39;s what it is but if</text>
  <text start="337.3" dur="3.84">something cryptic is going to come it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="339.16" dur="6.14">gonna come from this dude right here and</text>
  <text start="341.14" dur="6.57">it happens to come on a day like today</text>
  <text start="345.3" dur="5.11">meanwhile House Democrats go an</text>
  <text start="347.71" dur="4.08">absolutely ballistic over Trump and yet</text>
  <text start="350.41" dur="2.1">they&amp;#39;re saying that he&amp;#39;s having a</text>
  <text start="351.79" dur="4.59">meltdown</text>
  <text start="352.51" dur="6.35">over Syria and yeah I got footage of</text>
  <text start="356.38" dur="2.48">that too</text>
  <text start="366.1" dur="10.21">you know that&amp;#39;s not the real footage</text>
  <text start="370.37" dur="7.8">this is the real footage we had to say</text>
  <text start="376.31" dur="13.2">madam Speaker youyou just said the</text>
  <text start="378.17" dur="14.58">president is not really a faker</text>
  <text start="389.51" dur="6.93">you just said earlier he said the</text>
  <text start="392.75" dur="14.16">communists are taking over Isis were</text>
  <text start="396.44" dur="12.9">communist okay so yeah I did nothing to</text>
  <text start="406.91" dur="5.37">that video the first one I may have</text>
  <text start="409.34" dur="5.49">edited the second one not at all that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="412.28" dur="5.19">exactly how that ended it if you watched</text>
  <text start="414.83" dur="4.17">it that&amp;#39;s exactly what you saw very</text>
  <text start="417.47" dur="4.02">uncomfortable indeed and of course</text>
  <text start="419" dur="4.44">Democrats are in a panic the threat of</text>
  <text start="421.49" dur="3.81">this IG report once again being held</text>
  <text start="423.44" dur="3.66">over their heads and that we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="425.3" dur="5.25">this for so long and for some reason it</text>
  <text start="427.1" dur="6.96">keeps prompting more defensive maneuvers</text>
  <text start="430.55" dur="5.46">so lots going on but evidently they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="434.06" dur="3.51">just going to go ahead and move the</text>
  <text start="436.01" dur="4.26">goalposts here they&amp;#39;re not willing to</text>
  <text start="437.57" dur="4.29">take an impeachment vote they are saying</text>
  <text start="440.27" dur="2.73">that you know they&amp;#39;re just kind of</text>
  <text start="441.86" dur="3.9">trying to shift the narrative now to</text>
  <text start="443" dur="5.61">Syria because the impeachment thing once</text>
  <text start="445.76" dur="4.35">again has fallen on his face so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="448.61" dur="2.37">want to go way into that because you</text>
  <text start="450.11" dur="2.52">know it&amp;#39;s I think we&amp;#39;re kind of</text>
  <text start="450.98" dur="3.03">inundated with news I really want to</text>
  <text start="452.63" dur="3.75">follow up on this story from the other</text>
  <text start="454.01" dur="3.81">day and why I think it&amp;#39;s important now</text>

  <text start="942.97" dur="3.66">connections I just want to point out</text>
  <text start="944.35" dur="4.53">that I didn&amp;#39;t see anything direct as of</text>
  <text start="946.63" dur="4.079">now that may change some more stuff may</text>
  <text start="948.88" dur="3.75">come in maybe some people will find</text>
  <text start="950.709" dur="3.57">something online but as of now I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="952.63" dur="3.18">seen anything but I would assume if</text>
  <text start="954.279" dur="4.051">you&amp;#39;re a CEO of a corporation you</text>
  <text start="955.81" dur="4.17">probably at least know who the head of</text>

  <text start="963.579" dur="4.171">possibilities either way but the point</text>
  <text start="965.38" dur="3.899">is is that she was there and she did</text>
  <text start="967.75" dur="4.56">have a pretty big responsibility she</text>

  <text start="978.61" dur="2.88">probably there&amp;#39;s a chance that they</text>
  <text start="979.87" dur="3.15">probably would have met because I would</text>
  <text start="981.49" dur="2.67">imagine if you&amp;#39;re working for overstock</text>

  <text start="1444.82" dur="1.77">I want to kind of paint this picture</text>

  <text start="1455.05" dur="3.66">well that would explain why she knows so</text>
  <text start="1456.82" dur="3.99">much about investing and things like</text>
  <text start="1458.71" dur="3.84">that and so that doesn&amp;#39;t really surprise</text>
  <text start="1460.81" dur="3.47">me but I want to point out that she</text>
  <text start="1462.55" dur="4.86">graduated from Georgetown University</text>
  <text start="1464.28" dur="4.84">just like our political experts over</text>
  <text start="1467.41" dur="3.75">there who were actually computer science</text>
  <text start="1469.12" dur="4.83">experts not political science experts</text>
  <text start="1471.16" dur="5.31">they were computer science experts but</text>
  <text start="1473.95" dur="5.79">were also voting experts</text>
  <text start="1476.47" dur="6.42">I wonder if Aaron is also a voting</text>
  <text start="1479.74" dur="6.39">expert hint wink wink right don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1482.89" dur="5.52">but I find it very curious that her last</text>
  <text start="1486.13" dur="5.76">couple tweets had to do with Hillary</text>
  <text start="1488.41" dur="5.94">Clinton but what we do know is she went</text>

  <text start="1494.35" dur="5.37">lend to where I want to go all this</text>
  <text start="1497.02" dur="4.56">seems to suggest from the apps to the</text>

  <text start="1520.39" dur="3.93">want to talk about at all who just went</text>
  <text start="1522.19" dur="5.76">missing well her family sure was looking</text>
  <text start="1524.32" dur="5.19">for so this was a big big deal now I</text>
  <text start="1527.95" dur="3.21">don&amp;#39;t exactly know where the connections</text>
  <text start="1529.51" dur="5.1">are here but what this suggests to me is</text>
  <text start="1531.16" dur="5.64">some possible MK ULTRA like I said this</text>
  <text start="1534.61" dur="4.02">is looks to be some sort of voice to</text>
  <text start="1536.8" dur="3.96">skull technology that they&amp;#39;re dabbling</text>
  <text start="1538.63" dur="4.26">in here look at my last video to kind of</text>
  <text start="1540.76" dur="3.6">see you know the the tech aspect of what</text>
  <text start="1542.89" dur="3.03">we were talking about but there was a</text>
  <text start="1544.36" dur="4.11">lot of things going on through these</text>
  <text start="1545.92" dur="4.08">apps and remember one of the last things</text>
  <text start="1548.47" dur="3.66">that she said as she was bouncing around</text>
  <text start="1550" dur="4.62">visiting friends before she was supposed</text>
  <text start="1552.13" dur="3.86">to fly back was that we were living in</text>

  <text start="1555.99" dur="3.76">worrying her parents that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="1558.64" dur="3.39">thought she was in trouble in the first</text>

  <text start="1562.03" dur="2.71">the matrix</text>
  <text start="1562.64" dur="3.84">is it possible that she was facilitating</text>
  <text start="1564.74" dur="4.41">this all the time and it was just</text>
  <text start="1566.48" dur="5.04">discovering this not really sure but I</text>
  <text start="1569.15" dur="4.77">want to let you know exactly why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1571.52" dur="4.32">talking about MKULTRA here she attended</text>
  <text start="1573.92" dur="3.63">Georgetown University well surely</text>
  <text start="1575.84" dur="3.86">Georgetown University doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1577.55" dur="5.37">anything to do with MKULTRA does it or</text>
  <text start="1579.7" dur="8.02">does it this is from the Washington Post</text>
  <text start="1582.92" dur="6.9">from way back in the day 1977 the CIA</text>
  <text start="1587.72" dur="4.5">used the University of Maryland and</text>

  <text start="1612.47" dur="5.64">not officially confirmed the three local</text>

  <text start="1622.82" dur="6.93">wittingly some not in the MKULTRA tests</text>
  <text start="1626.39" dur="7.17">okay so back in the 70s they were coming</text>
  <text start="1629.75" dur="5.7">out saying that were 80 at least 80 that</text>
  <text start="1633.56" dur="4.02">was ones that they told about this was</text>

  <text start="1637.58" dur="4.17">and 60s</text>
  <text start="1638.33" dur="5.43">so imagine where we are right now but we</text>
  <text start="1641.75" dur="4.34">know that your Georgetown University was</text>
  <text start="1643.76" dur="4.8">one of them and we do know that it is</text>

  <text start="1801.02" dur="3.6">remember this story and you can go look</text>
  <text start="1802.46" dur="7.02">it up a man drove on to the White House</text>
  <text start="1804.62" dur="6.78">long and he had a gun and a lot of the</text>
  <text start="1809.48" dur="3.66">different media conglomerates just kind</text>
  <text start="1811.4" dur="3.54">of reported that and that the security</text>

  <text start="1819.44" dur="3.42">sorry don&amp;#39;t quote me but you can go back</text>
  <text start="1820.82" dur="4.56">and you can see I reported on this a</text>
  <text start="1822.86" dur="4.14">couple of times this guy got out of his</text>
  <text start="1825.38" dur="2.78">car with his gun and he didn&amp;#39;t attempt</text>

  <text start="1844.06" dur="3.84">media group even reported that at all</text>
  <text start="1846.4" dur="2.55">and then got right off it we never heard</text>
  <text start="1847.9" dur="3.39">this story again</text>
  <text start="1848.95" dur="5.04">but I want to remind you that this stuff</text>
  <text start="1851.29" dur="4.98">is possible and it seems now that we</text>
  <text start="1853.99" dur="4.11">even have some suspicious voting</text>
  <text start="1856.27" dur="3.96">behavior going on and it may even have</text>
  <text start="1858.1" dur="4.71">to do with the resignation of this</text>
  <text start="1860.23" dur="5.64">Patrick Byrne okay so is it possible</text>
  <text start="1862.81" dur="5.1">that our boy Patrick Byrne who made a</text>
  <text start="1865.87" dur="4.44">decision a while back to come clean and</text>
  <text start="1867.91" dur="3.9">if you&amp;#39;ll remember he went on all the</text>
  <text start="1870.31" dur="4.32">different news channels talking about</text>
  <text start="1871.81" dur="5.52">his affair with Marie abou Tina who did</text>
  <text start="1874.63" dur="4.56">plead guilty for conspiracy she failed</text>
  <text start="1877.33" dur="3.21">to register as a foreign agent and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1879.19" dur="3.63">seeing a lot of that that was a very</text>
  <text start="1880.54" dur="4.47">similar thing that brought down at Tony</text>
  <text start="1882.82" dur="3.84">Podesta but we&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of this</text>
  <text start="1885.01" dur="3.6">right well it looked like she was a spy</text>
  <text start="1886.66" dur="4.92">she got in this sort of a romantic</text>
  <text start="1888.61" dur="4.77">relationship with him and here he was on</text>
  <text start="1891.58" dur="4.05">all the news stations coming clean about</text>
  <text start="1893.38" dur="5.31">it he may remember it was very very odd</text>
  <text start="1895.63" dur="5.73">right and it almost seemed too strange</text>
  <text start="1898.69" dur="5.09">to believe except for one key part that</text>
  <text start="1901.36" dur="6.96">I&amp;#39;d like to remember eyes you about</text>
  <text start="1903.78" dur="7.57">nobody and I mean nobody contradicted</text>
  <text start="1908.32" dur="5.91">him and still to this day</text>
  <text start="1911.35" dur="4.44">nobody&amp;#39;s contradicted his story now he</text>
  <text start="1914.23" dur="3.18">said he kind of drummed up this</text>
  <text start="1915.79" dur="3.06">relationship obviously through mutual</text>
  <text start="1917.41" dur="3.18">friends she was at parties and whatever</text>
  <text start="1918.85" dur="4.17">she kind of came on to him typical sort</text>
  <text start="1920.59" dur="4.71">of thing right but as it got a little</text>
  <text start="1923.02" dur="3.63">bit heavier he was saying he realized</text>
  <text start="1925.3" dur="2.85">there was more to this and she was</text>
  <text start="1926.65" dur="3.99">trying to get it Trump and although he</text>
  <text start="1928.15" dur="3.75">wasn&amp;#39;t really a Trump fan you know he</text>
  <text start="1930.64" dur="4.53">realized that something was really</text>
  <text start="1931.9" dur="5.28">really wrong here and that is when he</text>
  <text start="1935.17" dur="3.78">went to all these news stations and if</text>
  <text start="1937.18" dur="3.81">you remember watching this you can kind</text>
  <text start="1938.95" dur="3.81">of see he has sort of a fear about him</text>
  <text start="1940.99" dur="3.96">he has sort of a resignation about him</text>
  <text start="1942.76" dur="4.26">clearly he was in the wrong about</text>
  <text start="1944.95" dur="3.6">something and he almost feels like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1947.02" dur="4.98">doing this to get off his chest</text>
  <text start="1948.55" dur="5.7">is he reconciling somehow and if this is</text>
  <text start="1952" dur="3.84">indeed a Russian plant and we know this</text>
  <text start="1954.25" dur="3.36">butene it was part of the Russian</text>
  <text start="1955.84" dur="4.26">Federation basically it&amp;#39;s essentially a</text>
  <text start="1957.61" dur="3.95">Putin&amp;#39;s political party right we know</text>
  <text start="1960.1" dur="4.27">this to be true</text>
  <text start="1961.56" dur="7.2">would this bring in any kind of MKULTRA</text>
  <text start="1964.37" dur="6.46">ideals considering burns not only his</text>
  <text start="1968.76" dur="4.44">education but its higher education at</text>
  <text start="1970.83" dur="5.94">Stanford which was not only MKULTRA</text>
  <text start="1973.2" dur="7.08">directed but counter operational towards</text>
  <text start="1976.77" dur="5.76">Russian ops just saying it all seems to</text>
  <text start="1980.28" dur="4.83">lay itself out really really neatly and</text>
  <text start="1982.53" dur="5.79">is that why intelligence officials are</text>
  <text start="1985.11" dur="5.4">like he claimed approached him about</text>
  <text start="1988.32" dur="4.77">keeping the relationship going was that</text>
  <text start="1990.51" dur="4.8">why they did it hard to really say but</text>
  <text start="1993.09" dur="4.53">my guess is that although again and I</text>
  <text start="1995.31" dur="5.13">never liked to say black hat white hat I</text>
  <text start="1997.62" dur="4.98">think what we have here is a Patrick</text>
  <text start="2000.44" dur="3.96">Byrne what we do know is that he had</text>
  <text start="2002.6" dur="4.35">tons and tons of data you can think back</text>
  <text start="2004.4" dur="4.8">to his issue with gradient technologies</text>
  <text start="2006.95" dur="4.2">excuse me grading analytics this had to</text>
  <text start="2009.2" dur="3.75">do with fixing prices and stuff like</text>
  <text start="2011.15" dur="4.32">that he&amp;#39;s been wrapped up in tons and</text>
  <text start="2012.95" dur="4.98">tons of data and I just showed you the</text>
  <text start="2015.47" dur="4.59">connections here to this vote that we</text>
  <text start="2017.93" dur="4.38">already know was hacked and we already</text>
  <text start="2020.06" dur="3.81">know seem to look like it was coinciding</text>
  <text start="2022.31" dur="4.74">with his resignation</text>
  <text start="2023.87" dur="5.82">so did he get caught doing some voting</text>
  <text start="2027.05" dur="4.77">knucklehead entry and in order to</text>
  <text start="2029.69" dur="5.94">reconcile comes out with this story that</text>
  <text start="2031.82" dur="5.55">nobody has yet to refute how it leads up</text>
  <text start="2035.63" dur="3.72">to this Aaron Valenti I&amp;#39;m not really</text>
  <text start="2037.37" dur="4.38">sure but I&amp;#39;m showing you some clear-cut</text>
  <text start="2039.35" dur="5.61">connections and then again we have this</text>

  <text start="2141.9" dur="3.42">you down below it&amp;#39;s kind of personal</text>

  <text start="2148.83" dur="4.05">pretty fair but I want to just read this</text>
  <text start="2151.02" dur="5.46">little part here in section 2 where he</text>
  <text start="2152.88" dur="5.94">says in 2005 I began to understand how</text>
  <text start="2156.48" dur="5.28">the oligarchy was looting the savings of</text>
  <text start="2158.82" dur="5.28">America via the settlement system I</text>
  <text start="2161.76" dur="4.14">tried to expose it and discovered that</text>
  <text start="2164.1" dur="4.04">the institutions that should have been</text>
  <text start="2165.9" dur="5.64">interested were either disinterested or</text>
  <text start="2168.14" dur="5.68">adversarial exploring that subject gave</text>
  <text start="2171.54" dur="3.78">birth to deep capture readers of this</text>

  <text start="2181.17" dur="4.23">there were but two exceptions okay well</text>
  <text start="2183.09" dur="4.56">let you read the rest there so but he</text>
  <text start="2185.4" dur="4.11">discovered this back in 2005 through</text>

  <text start="2189.51" dur="5.1">would know like I said he was part of</text>
