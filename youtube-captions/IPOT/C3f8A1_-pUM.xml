  <text start="968.11" dur="8.32">first of all let&amp;#39;s answer the next</text>
  <text start="971.39" dur="7.5">couple questions first what is the DOJ</text>
  <text start="976.43" dur="4.02">responsible for justice that&amp;#39;s why</text>

  <text start="1013.96" dur="4.5">us all out and of course she got a free</text>
  <text start="1016.6" dur="4.98">pass because those were all her cronies</text>
  <text start="1018.46" dur="4.86">in the DOJ in the FBI there were all the</text>

  <text start="1052.03" dur="2.43">and that&amp;#39;s the problem</text>
  <text start="1052.9" dur="4.8">but with Hillary Clinton you tie him to</text>
  <text start="1054.46" dur="4.74">a massive massive global network</text>

  <text start="1258.76" dur="4.56">these inner clowns well why why did Marc</text>
  <text start="1261.49" dur="4.86">Pompeo step in well who was Secretary of</text>
  <text start="1263.32" dur="5.04">State prior to that and who was she</text>
  <text start="1266.35" dur="5.13">wrapped up with worldwide it was</text>
  <text start="1268.36" dur="5.1">worldwide the CIA was that was North</text>
  <text start="1271.48" dur="3.179">Korea that was Iran that was it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1273.46" dur="3.87">everything we&amp;#39;re trying to fight is</text>
  <text start="1274.659" dur="4.351">really came down to the position of when</text>
  <text start="1277.33" dur="3.36">Hillary was in Secretary of State to</text>
  <text start="1279.01" dur="3.57">work in everything through the CIA of</text>
  <text start="1280.69" dur="4.56">course they&amp;#39;re deeply connected think</text>
  <text start="1282.58" dur="4.62">offshore ya think worldwide think</text>
  <text start="1285.25" dur="4.98">offshore accounts think Iranian national</text>
  <text start="1287.2" dur="6.18">bank accounts think all this funnily</text>
  <text start="1290.23" dur="4.86">going through the EU military Intel</text>
  <text start="1293.38" dur="4.59">providing support during this time very</text>
  <text start="1295.09" dur="5.79">likely and I don&amp;#39;t know how much of our</text>
  <text start="1297.97" dur="5.579">own military but probably some and of</text>
  <text start="1300.88" dur="4.74">course foreign military as well wire</text>
  <text start="1303.549" dur="4.951">select executive orders aggressively</text>
  <text start="1305.62" dur="4.669">being written and put into law well</text>
  <text start="1308.5" dur="5.49">that&amp;#39;s a really good question</text>
  <text start="1310.289" dur="5.981">state slash CIA next well these</text>
  <text start="1313.99" dur="4.14">executive orders remember this first</text>
  <text start="1316.27" dur="4.44">start depth of their very first really</text>
  <text start="1318.13" dur="4.35">big one the big bomb drop was basically</text>
  <text start="1320.71" dur="4.04">declaring a state of emergency and</text>
  <text start="1322.48" dur="4.65">remember the president gets</text>
  <text start="1324.75" dur="4.24">unprecedented powers into during a state</text>
  <text start="1327.13" dur="3.36">of emergency now we can disagree or</text>
  <text start="1328.99" dur="4.26">agree on that you know but that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1330.49" dur="3.6">different story but this had a lot to do</text>
  <text start="1333.25" dur="3.27">with human right</text>
  <text start="1334.09" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s abuse and taking away their funding</text>
  <text start="1336.52" dur="3.24">okay whatever was supporting things that</text>
  <text start="1338.32" dur="3.18">were violating human rights and was</text>
  <text start="1339.76" dur="3.659">being a little bit nebulous but I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="1341.5" dur="3.45">in legal terms it was talking to the</text>
  <text start="1343.419" dur="3.301">people that it needed to talk to does</text>
  <text start="1344.95" dur="3.709">that make sense okay so now we have the</text>
  <text start="1346.72" dur="4.38">State Department CIA next most likely</text>
  <text start="1348.659" dur="5.471">well who was committing the big human</text>
  <text start="1351.1" dur="6.84">rights abuses the CIA okay</text>
  <text start="1354.13" dur="6.06">North Korea that&amp;#39;s a big human rights</text>
  <text start="1357.94" dur="5.01">abuse I would say threatening nuclear</text>
  <text start="1360.19" dur="5.609">war you know is a pretty big human</text>
  <text start="1362.95" dur="6.78">rights abuse think logically no outside</text>
  <text start="1365.799" dur="6.451">coms I&amp;#39;m assuming maybe that this deep</text>
  <text start="1369.73" dur="3.9">state doesn&amp;#39;t really have the the calms</text>
  <text start="1372.25" dur="2.97">that they have anymore I&amp;#39;m not sure if</text>
  <text start="1373.63" dur="4.38">somebody probably debate me on that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1375.22" dur="4.829">not exactly sure about that but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1378.01" dur="3.21">assuming now that they&amp;#39;ve cut away their</text>
  <text start="1380.049" dur="2.61">intelligence they&amp;#39;ve taken away the</text>
  <text start="1381.22" dur="3.9">intelligence it&amp;#39;s no longer there and</text>
  <text start="1382.659" dur="5.341">now we could start serving justice okay</text>
  <text start="1385.12" dur="5.1">and on all that I know this is</text>
  <text start="1388" dur="4.11">slow-moving folks I really do and again</text>
  <text start="1390.22" dur="4.86">like I said I&amp;#39;ve no Q apologist I&amp;#39;m no</text>
  <text start="1392.11" dur="6.449">Trump apologist I disagree at times</text>
  <text start="1395.08" dur="6.089">myself with things but if we&amp;#39;re bought</text>
  <text start="1398.559" dur="4.11">into this sort of November timeline then</text>
  <text start="1401.169" dur="4.23">I think that we have to kind of think</text>
  <text start="1402.669" dur="4.321">with that sort of logic and we have to</text>
  <text start="1405.399" dur="4.171">kind of follow this you can disagree or</text>
  <text start="1406.99" dur="4.5">agree wherever you like you&amp;#39;re always</text>
  <text start="1409.57" dur="3.93">welcome to do that I&amp;#39;m giving you this</text>
  <text start="1411.49" dur="3.9">information or simply so that you can</text>
  <text start="1413.5" dur="5.94">hear it out loud and think it through</text>
  <text start="1415.39" dur="6.12">for yourself that&amp;#39;s the whole point but</text>
  <text start="1419.44" dur="6.959">that being said I think there&amp;#39;s still a</text>
  <text start="1421.51" dur="7.07">lot to show for this however we the</text>

  <text start="1433.09" dur="2.819">counting on President Trump to save us</text>
  <text start="1434.559" dur="4.051">all from that then we&amp;#39;re missing the</text>
  <text start="1435.909" dur="5.37">point the point is to start sourcing</text>
