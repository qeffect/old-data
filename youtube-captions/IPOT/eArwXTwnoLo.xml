  <text start="237.36" dur="3.78">was later dropped after Klopfer</text>
  <text start="238.8" dur="5.07">completed a pretrial diversion program</text>
  <text start="241.14" dur="4.26">ok so this is a terrible story although</text>
  <text start="243.87" dur="3.21">like I said this is really good news</text>
  <text start="245.4" dur="3.03">that we&amp;#39;re finding out about this that</text>
  <text start="247.08" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s coming to light because this really</text>
  <text start="248.43" dur="4.35">exposes the true nature of what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="251.01" dur="3.9">on with this whole abortion situation</text>
  <text start="252.78" dur="4.95">and I think many of you understand what</text>
  <text start="254.91" dur="4.44">I mean when you are talking about maybe</text>
  <text start="257.73" dur="3.39">even to your you&amp;#39;re debating your</text>
  <text start="259.35" dur="3.99">friends your family or whatever about</text>
  <text start="261.12" dur="4.56">this kind of topic this has been around</text>
  <text start="263.34" dur="4.829">forever and if you just want to talk</text>
  <text start="265.68" dur="4.29">about the standard talking points the</text>
  <text start="268.169" dur="4.5">people who were either pro or against</text>
  <text start="269.97" dur="5.46">abortion they&amp;#39;re always kind of tend to</text>
  <text start="272.669" dur="3.931">be the same for the same reasons and I</text>
  <text start="275.43" dur="2.73">don&amp;#39;t really think there&amp;#39;s there and no</text>
  <text start="276.6" dur="3.54">one&amp;#39;s ever gonna budge with that so it</text>
  <text start="278.16" dur="2.19">doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you overturn Roe vs.</text>
  <text start="280.14" dur="2.19">Wade</text>
  <text start="280.35" dur="3.48">one way or another there will always be</text>
  <text start="282.33" dur="3.089">that other side that wants to argue</text>
  <text start="283.83" dur="3.51">against it but when people really start</text>
  <text start="285.419" dur="4.381">to see what the true nature of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="287.34" dur="3.6">going on with these abortions and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="289.8" dur="2.79">really happening and that this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="290.94" dur="3.63">really about the woman&amp;#39;s right to choose</text>
  <text start="292.59" dur="4.38">at all this is about a really extensive</text>
  <text start="294.57" dur="4.62">problem this guy was found with more</text>
  <text start="296.97" dur="4.44">than two thousand unborn babies more</text>
  <text start="299.19" dur="2.85">than two thousand now keep in mind he</text>
  <text start="301.41" dur="4.56">stopped</text>
  <text start="302.04" dur="6.21">doing abortions in 2016 so imagine when</text>
  <text start="305.97" dur="4.89">he was doing the abortions how many we</text>
  <text start="308.25" dur="5.07">never caught but more importantly two</text>
  <text start="310.86" dur="4.26">years later this guy&amp;#39;s still got him how</text>
  <text start="313.32" dur="3.45">does he get up and they&amp;#39;re medically</text>
  <text start="315.12" dur="3.57">preserved so this means there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="316.77" dur="3.87">obviously something bigger here this</text>
  <text start="318.69" dur="3.87">guy&amp;#39;s not just doing this for his love</text>
  <text start="320.64" dur="3.45">of the woman&amp;#39;s right to choose right now</text>
  <text start="322.56" dur="2.97">I want to point a couple things out but</text>
  <text start="324.09" dur="3.87">first let me take you over here to the</text>
  <text start="325.53" dur="4.23">federalists fetus collecting abortion is</text>
  <text start="327.96" dur="4.68">connected to unlicensed abortion</text>

  <text start="378.78" dur="4.95">now the next paragraph goes on to talk</text>
  <text start="380.97" dur="4.17">about Klopfer and all his little issues</text>
  <text start="383.73" dur="2.82">about you know being revoked or whether</text>
  <text start="385.14" dur="3.03">we were kind of just talking about that</text>
  <text start="386.55" dur="4.29">but I want to talk about this right here</text>
  <text start="388.17" dur="4.41">it is unclear how Klopfer preserved the</text>
  <text start="390.84" dur="4.41">dead babies or whether any of the unborn</text>
  <text start="392.58" dur="5.22">babies were of a gestational age of 20</text>

  <text start="407.7" dur="4.62">themselves from the now-deceased Klopfer</text>
  <text start="409.65" dur="4.83">as they did with Kermit Gosnell another</text>

  <text start="414.48" dur="5.31">collecting body parts from his victim so</text>
  <text start="417.36" dur="3.75">this is a little bit of a trend yet when</text>

  <text start="501.169" dur="2.64">to interject here this was kind of part</text>
  <text start="502.639" dur="3.87">of what we saw with some of the</text>

  <text start="515.75" dur="3.3">does is it gives these women a little</text>

  <text start="519.05" dur="4.109">it&amp;#39;s a big big decision when you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="523.159" dur="2.881">say whatever we want about our feelings</text>
  <text start="524.93" dur="2.19">about abortion but the fact of the</text>
  <text start="526.04" dur="4.02">matter is that when you&amp;#39;re dealing with</text>
  <text start="527.12" dur="4.35">some sort of young young lady who&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="818.61" dur="4.62">theorist per se but I do find these</text>
  <text start="821.61" dur="3.599">logos to be pretty fascinating and as</text>
  <text start="823.23" dur="4.5">somebody who has spent a lot of time</text>
  <text start="825.209" dur="4.47">researching human rights organizations</text>

  <text start="837.509" dur="3.12">and I always come up with these same</text>
  <text start="839.069" dur="3.901">kind of red flags but the first thing I</text>
  <text start="840.629" dur="4.2">want to start off is on this logo now I</text>
  <text start="842.97" dur="4.229">will never dam a group just because of</text>
  <text start="844.829" dur="4.11">their logo because I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="847.199" dur="3.93">really fair but I think there are some</text>
  <text start="848.939" dur="3.541">things to look out for here and as</text>
  <text start="851.129" dur="4.14">you&amp;#39;ll see you&amp;#39;ll see this little spiral</text>
  <text start="852.48" dur="4.62">here not completely uncommon now we do</text>
  <text start="855.269" dur="4.021">know from the FBI&amp;#39;s official website</text>
  <text start="857.1" dur="4.799">that if we see sort of a spiral like</text>
  <text start="859.29" dur="4.979">that but in a triangular form that is a</text>
  <text start="861.899" dur="4.05">pedophile known pedophile symbol so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="864.269" dur="2.91">not really sure about the spiral itself</text>
  <text start="865.949" dur="4.44">but I just want to point out that it</text>
  <text start="867.179" dur="6.15">comes up in a lot of these logos and now</text>
  <text start="870.389" dur="4.44">in regards to this person here for some</text>
  <text start="873.329" dur="4.29">reason I just want to point out that all</text>
  <text start="874.829" dur="4.2">the time I see whenever they draw these</text>
  <text start="877.619" dur="2.49">people they always do it with this I</text>
  <text start="879.029" dur="2.4">don&amp;#39;t know what you call it look like a</text>
  <text start="880.109" dur="3.09">monkey wrench to me but it&amp;#39;s a body</text>
  <text start="881.429" dur="4.26">right they always do it with this same</text>
  <text start="883.199" dur="4.32">similar fashion I&amp;#39;m not really sure if</text>
  <text start="885.689" dur="3.15">there&amp;#39;s any meaning there but I just</text>
  <text start="887.519" dur="2.94">want to point it out for those of you</text>
  <text start="888.839" dur="3.69">who do pay attention to the logos</text>
  <text start="890.459" dur="3.42">because they do mean something and it is</text>
  <text start="892.529" dur="3.511">important to notice you&amp;#39;re also gonna</text>
  <text start="893.879" dur="4.05">always a lot of times see a couple hands</text>
  <text start="896.04" dur="3.719">held together maybe a heart inside</text>
  <text start="897.929" dur="3.99">there&amp;#39;s a lot of recurring themes that</text>
  <text start="899.759" dur="4.08">go into these logos and I just want to</text>
  <text start="901.919" dur="3.811">point that out but this is whole woman&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="903.839" dur="4.83">health I don&amp;#39;t want to get way into them</text>
  <text start="905.73" dur="4.5">but I do want to take you here this is</text>
  <text start="908.669" dur="4.2">the this seems to be the one they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="931.619" dur="4.5">actually are but I do want to point out</text>
  <text start="933.989" dur="4.89">this location because I noticed a few</text>
  <text start="936.119" dur="4.2">things in regards to this location I</text>
  <text start="938.879" dur="3.45">just want to show you a few things that</text>
  <text start="940.319" dur="4.08">are in the area and let you decide for</text>
  <text start="942.329" dur="3.75">yourself but in order to get some</text>
  <text start="944.399" dur="3.48">context for where I&amp;#39;m going with this I</text>
  <text start="946.079" dur="4.92">highly suggest checking out my previous</text>
  <text start="947.879" dur="5.07">video entitled infinite Chan impossible</text>
  <text start="950.999" dur="3.21">food now particularly in that video we</text>
  <text start="952.949" dur="3.72">were talking about a group called</text>
  <text start="954.209" dur="5.37">impossible food they make this sort of</text>
  <text start="956.669" dur="5.27">meatless burger including the impossible</text>
  <text start="959.579" dur="5.01">whopper over there at Burger King and</text>
  <text start="961.939" dur="4.93">all sorts of stuff now I&amp;#39;m not directly</text>
  <text start="964.589" dur="3.9">implying that they are involved in any</text>
  <text start="966.869" dur="2.761">kind of baby trade or whatever but we</text>
  <text start="968.489" dur="3.601">were just talking about some</text>
  <text start="969.63" dur="4.83">things that were curious in their</text>
  <text start="972.09" dur="3.99">parameter - but we were talking about</text>
  <text start="974.46" dur="4.05">Planned Parenthood and we were talking</text>
  <text start="976.08" dur="5.85">about a group called stem express stem</text>
  <text start="978.51" dur="5.9">Express is a Cell Stem Cell procurement</text>
  <text start="981.93" dur="4.89">agency and they had actually been caught</text>
  <text start="984.41" dur="4.84">procuring baby parts and we know this</text>
  <text start="986.82" dur="5.01">because a whistleblower who was working</text>
  <text start="989.25" dur="4.26">at a FedEx shipping center basically</text>
  <text start="991.83" dur="3">caught them and it looked like that it</text>
  <text start="993.51" dur="3.9">had been going on for quite some time</text>
  <text start="994.83" dur="5.7">now I&amp;#39;m not exactly sure as to what</text>
  <text start="997.41" dur="4.53">level the FedEx you know has with all</text>
  <text start="1000.53" dur="3.39">this but I do want to point out that</text>
  <text start="1001.94" dur="3.93">they had shipping centers not receiving</text>
  <text start="1003.92" dur="4.92">centers shipping centers with the trucks</text>
  <text start="1005.87" dur="4.62">and whatnot located next to you both in</text>
  <text start="1008.84" dur="3">possible labs and I show you that in the</text>
  <text start="1010.49" dur="2.79">video so please go check that out</text>
  <text start="1011.84" dur="2.73">because that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="1013.28" dur="2.88">and the reason why I&amp;#39;m bringing it up is</text>
  <text start="1014.57" dur="4.56">because here we have this Klopfer fella</text>
  <text start="1016.16" dur="4.92">who was just caught with over 2,000</text>
  <text start="1019.13" dur="3.63">preserved body parts and he was two</text>
  <text start="1021.08" dur="3.39">years out of business already so what</text>
  <text start="1022.76" dur="4.14">was he doing it for what was he</text>
  <text start="1024.47" dur="4.32">procuring it for so here we are back on</text>
  <text start="1026.9" dur="3.99">the googly map and on the left side of</text>

  <text start="1048.38" dur="3.93">Avenue and Lincoln Way anyway you can</text>
  <text start="1050.96" dur="3.96">see that it&amp;#39;s a very very close</text>
  <text start="1052.31" dur="4.68">proximity and that should mean something</text>
  <text start="1054.92" dur="3.96">now I&amp;#39;ve got the map readjusted here</text>
  <text start="1056.99" dur="4.11">right in the center there where the red</text>
  <text start="1058.88" dur="3.78">ping is that is you&amp;#39;re a whole woman&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1061.1" dur="2.88">health center and of course the women&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1062.66" dur="4.44">care centers right across the street</text>
  <text start="1063.98" dur="5.04">down this way if you found this way was</text>
  <text start="1067.1" dur="4.02">the Planned Parenthood incidentally</text>
  <text start="1069.02" dur="3.93">there was another woman&amp;#39;s care center</text>
  <text start="1071.12" dur="4.95">near there - looks like women&amp;#39;s care</text>
  <text start="1072.95" dur="5.82">center is on top of it but I want to</text>
  <text start="1076.07" dur="5.49">point your attention up here only 1.7</text>
  <text start="1078.77" dur="8.88">miles away right next to the airport is</text>
  <text start="1081.56" dur="8.94">a FedEx shipping center know and they</text>
  <text start="1087.65" dur="5.01">got trucks and planes and they&amp;#39;re right</text>
  <text start="1090.5" dur="4.62">next to the South Bend Airport the</text>
  <text start="1092.66" dur="5.22">Greyhound bus station and incidentally</text>
  <text start="1095.12" dur="4.68">right over here is enzyme research labs</text>
  <text start="1097.88" dur="5.38">right next to the International Airport</text>
  <text start="1099.8" dur="5.35">and dangerously close over here to this</text>
  <text start="1103.26" dur="3.66">whole woman&amp;#39;s care center now this</text>
  <text start="1105.15" dur="5.22">enzyme research labs I don&amp;#39;t know much</text>
  <text start="1106.92" dur="4.89">about but here is their site it says</text>
  <text start="1110.37" dur="4.68">that their product line includes</text>
  <text start="1111.81" dur="6.15">purified zymogens and active enzymes</text>
  <text start="1115.05" dur="5.67">from human and bovine plasmas active</text>
  <text start="1117.96" dur="4.68">site blocked enzymes monoclonal and</text>
  <text start="1120.72" dur="4.95">polyclonal antibodies to clotting</text>
  <text start="1122.64" dur="5.16">factors elisa reagents for detection of</text>
  <text start="1125.67" dur="7.2">clotting factors so it looks like they</text>
  <text start="1127.8" dur="6.63">deal with blood and coagulation nice ok</text>
  <text start="1132.87" dur="3.45">so there you go what we do know is that</text>
  <text start="1134.43" dur="3.69">FedEx was caught up with this stem</text>
  <text start="1136.32" dur="3.81">Express situation now we don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="1138.12" dur="3.99">deep and I also want to point out that</text>
  <text start="1140.13" dur="3.54">it was a FedEx employee that blew the</text>
  <text start="1142.11" dur="3.42">whistle on this so I don&amp;#39;t want to give</text>
  <text start="1143.67" dur="3.69">a you know kind of this blanket</text>
  <text start="1145.53" dur="3.78">accusation against FedEx but I do find</text>
  <text start="1147.36" dur="3.66">it very curious that it&amp;#39;s again not a</text>
  <text start="1149.31" dur="4.29">receiving center but a shipping center</text>
  <text start="1151.02" dur="4.65">found right near this center where this</text>
  <text start="1153.6" dur="4.62">guy was working who just got caught</text>
  <text start="1155.67" dur="5.94">actually he was he was dead and then got</text>
  <text start="1158.22" dur="5.22">caught with over 2000 you know baby</text>
  <text start="1161.61" dur="4.14">parts this was a very similar thing to</text>
  <text start="1163.44" dur="3.96">the sin Express situation so is there</text>
  <text start="1165.75" dur="3.63">connections to that Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="1167.4" dur="3.42">and FedEx don&amp;#39;t really know if you</text>
  <text start="1169.38" dur="3.66">haven&amp;#39;t seen the previous video you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1170.82" dur="3.63">understand those connections or at least</text>
  <text start="1173.04" dur="3.84">why we think this is a little suspect</text>
  <text start="1174.45" dur="4.26">but clearly this guy was up to something</text>
  <text start="1176.88" dur="3.27">he was keeping these parts around for</text>
  <text start="1178.71" dur="4.35">something he was procuring it for</text>
  <text start="1180.15" dur="4.74">something where was going who knows but</text>
  <text start="1183.06" dur="4.35">here we are over on the LA Times which</text>
  <text start="1184.89" dur="3.99">is kind of another dark story Democratic</text>

  <text start="1264.96" dur="3.089">accusations of human trafficking and</text>
  <text start="1266.61" dur="3.569">that&amp;#39;s one thing that I noticed all</text>
  <text start="1268.049" dur="4.47">these stories keep leaving out when they</text>
  <text start="1270.179" dur="4.291">talk about Edie buck if they talk about</text>

  <text start="1291.45" dur="3.99">in a position of power but manipulates</text>

  <text start="1307.47" dur="4.319">defendant nearly killed a third victim</text>
  <text start="1309.24" dur="4.62">last week okay so this is pretty wild</text>
  <text start="1311.789" dur="3.931">because this guy&amp;#39;s been doing this</text>
  <text start="1313.86" dur="3.6">before right and we already know he</text>
  <text start="1315.72" dur="4.23">suspect but there was insufficient</text>
  <text start="1317.46" dur="3.809">evidence and like I said implications of</text>
  <text start="1319.95" dur="3.179">human trafficking so I have a feeling</text>
  <text start="1321.269" dur="3.061">this might be more and then it seems</text>
  <text start="1323.129" dur="1.89">seems like this guy just can&amp;#39;t help</text>
  <text start="1324.33" dur="3.059">himself</text>
  <text start="1325.019" dur="3.931">buck is due in court on Wednesday for</text>
  <text start="1327.389" dur="2.821">his arraignment prosecutors were asking</text>
  <text start="1328.95" dur="3.87">that his bail be set at four million</text>
  <text start="1330.21" dur="4.049">dollars if convicted his charges charge</text>
  <text start="1332.82" dur="3.209">he faces up to five years and eight</text>
  <text start="1334.259" dur="3.63">months in state prison ok well let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1336.029" dur="3.15">hope he does go away but really what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1337.889" dur="3.24">really hoping is that this leads to</text>
  <text start="1339.179" dur="4.321">something else and I do think that this</text>
  <text start="1341.129" dur="3.871">has something to do with the Hollywood</text>
  <text start="1343.5" dur="3.48">Machine and I&amp;#39;ll give you some more</text>
  <text start="1345" dur="3.48">information that in a later date well</text>
  <text start="1346.98" dur="3.299">hopefully when I could drum up some more</text>
  <text start="1348.48" dur="3.569">information but I have a feeling we have</text>
  <text start="1350.279" dur="3.99">not heard the last from this Edie Bach</text>
  <text start="1352.049" dur="4.651">situation I have a feeling this is more</text>
  <text start="1354.269" dur="4.62">than just some former model pervert that</text>
  <text start="1356.7" dur="3.809">likes young gay black men and likes to</text>
  <text start="1358.889" dur="3.27">get high with them I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1360.509" dur="2.971">something much much more to this but</text>
  <text start="1362.159" dur="3.39">like I said hopefully there will be some</text>
  <text start="1363.48" dur="3.449">more to come but for now that&amp;#39;s all I</text>
