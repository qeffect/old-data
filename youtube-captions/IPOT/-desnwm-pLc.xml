  <text start="105.02" dur="4.23">to release on this project right here</text>
  <text start="107" dur="3.96">this was an audio book project that I</text>
  <text start="109.25" dur="4.35">had scheduled for that to be released on</text>
  <text start="110.96" dur="5.49">the 21st 1900 or the last president and</text>
  <text start="113.6" dur="4.769">this is a book by Ingersoll Lockwood who</text>
  <text start="116.45" dur="4.02">also wrote Baron Trump&amp;#39;s marvelous</text>
  <text start="118.369" dur="3.391">underground journey now oddly enough I</text>

  <text start="138.019" dur="3.271">and get this out as soon as I can but</text>
  <text start="139.37" dur="3.99">with Q posting the way Q is posting and</text>
  <text start="141.29" dur="3.93">of course POTUS undergoing impeachment I</text>
  <text start="143.36" dur="3.9">have a feeling that we&amp;#39;re probably going</text>
  <text start="145.22" dur="3.9">to get hit with a lot of Q posts and I</text>
  <text start="147.26" dur="3.119">really need to dedicate my time to that</text>
  <text start="149.12" dur="3.36">manner we&amp;#39;ll try and get this out as</text>
  <text start="150.379" dur="2.94">soon as I can so thank you guys for</text>
  <text start="152.48" dur="2.88">understanding</text>
  <text start="153.319" dur="3.541">and like I said I&amp;#39;ll let you know and</text>
  <text start="155.36" dur="4.65">then I will get this out as soon as</text>
  <text start="156.86" dur="5.04">possible let&amp;#39;s move on post 37 22 28</text>
  <text start="160.01" dur="4.11">minutes out to the hour of 10:00 we get</text>
  <text start="161.9" dur="4.08">this old tweet from POTUS who says the</text>
  <text start="164.12" dur="4.53">Moller report despite being written by</text>
  <text start="165.98" dur="6.39">angry Democrats and Trump aiders with an</text>
  <text start="168.65" dur="6.24">unlimited money behind it 35 million</text>
  <text start="172.37" dur="5.19">dollars didn&amp;#39;t lay a glove on me I did</text>
  <text start="174.89" dur="4.62">nothing wrong if the partisan dams ever</text>
  <text start="177.56" dur="5.22">tried to impeach I would first head to</text>
  <text start="179.51" dur="5.25">the US Supreme Court not only dot that</text>
  <text start="182.78" dur="4.26">bet bet bet that I wore I think the idea</text>
  <text start="184.76" dur="5.699">that Q is pointing out here is that he</text>
  <text start="187.04" dur="5.129">would first head to the US Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="190.459" dur="4.741">and of course this Twitter link just</text>
  <text start="192.169" dur="4.47">takes you to this tweet right here now</text>
  <text start="195.2" dur="3.869">the thing I wanted to point out about</text>
  <text start="196.639" dur="5.701">this particular picture here as you can</text>
  <text start="199.069" dur="6">see it&amp;#39;s a PNG and we can see that it is</text>
  <text start="202.34" dur="5.789">titled screenshot 2019 for 24 which is</text>
  <text start="205.069" dur="7.471">of course the date April 24 2019 and</text>
  <text start="208.129" dur="6.151">then we see this at 22 21.5 0 dot which</text>
  <text start="212.54" dur="4.289">suggests to me that this is probably at</text>
  <text start="214.28" dur="4.919">least part of an IP address and let me</text>
  <text start="216.829" dur="5.101">show you what I mean over here this is</text>
  <text start="219.199" dur="4.111">what is my IP address com and you can</text>
  <text start="221.93" dur="7.08">see here as an example one here IP</text>
  <text start="223.31" dur="7.59">details for one 98.22 dot 21.5 0 so the</text>
  <text start="229.01" dur="4.53">same back half here of an IP address</text>
  <text start="230.9" dur="5.309">which is what I&amp;#39;m imagining this is</text>
  <text start="233.54" dur="4.83">going to now what that IP address is and</text>
  <text start="236.209" dur="4.02">for why it&amp;#39;s labeled like that I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="238.37" dur="3.539">exactly sure but some of you people who</text>
  <text start="240.229" dur="3.66">were smarter than me can help me figure</text>
  <text start="241.909" dur="3.69">it out but I&amp;#39;m smart enough to know that</text>
  <text start="243.889" dur="3.21">back then we weren&amp;#39;t even talking about</text>
  <text start="245.599" dur="3.271">Ukraine yet we were talking about Russia</text>
  <text start="247.099" dur="3.691">right and so it&amp;#39;s amazing how they</text>
  <text start="248.87" dur="3.81">wanted to impeach him then when it was</text>
  <text start="250.79" dur="5.309">all about Russia even though now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="252.68" dur="5.04">all about Ukraine and yet both angles</text>
  <text start="256.099" dur="3.42">they wanted to impeach doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="257.72" dur="3">make sense does it no and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="259.519" dur="5.341">POTUS is going to the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="260.72" dur="6.21">let&amp;#39;s move on most 37:23 40 minutes</text>
  <text start="264.86" dur="4.47">after the hour of 10 we get a link to</text>
  <text start="266.93" dur="4.29">the National Review and this is called</text>
  <text start="269.33" dur="4.47">an impeachment roll for the Supreme</text>
  <text start="271.22" dur="4.199">Court it&amp;#39;s a rather long article and to</text>
  <text start="273.8" dur="3.45">be honest with you it&amp;#39;s a bit below va</text>
  <text start="275.419" dur="3.78">ting but I think what Q is trying to</text>
  <text start="277.25" dur="3.96">turn our attention to is basically just</text>
  <text start="279.199" dur="3.84">letting us know that the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="281.21" dur="2.519">plays an important role in this whole</text>
  <text start="283.039" dur="2.401">process</text>
  <text start="283.729" dur="2.87">now we&amp;#39;re gonna parse through some of</text>
  <text start="285.44" dur="4.92">this here because we&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="286.599" dur="6.341">parsers project I believe it is clear</text>
  <text start="290.36" dur="3.989">that the authors of the Constitution did</text>
  <text start="292.94" dur="3.42">not want a president removed for</text>
  <text start="294.349" dur="3.69">anything less than a high crime and that</text>
  <text start="296.36" dur="4.38">none of the impeachment efforts in</text>
  <text start="298.039" dur="4.681">history would qualify Andrew Johnson had</text>
  <text start="300.74" dur="4.079">fired the war secretary which was his</text>
  <text start="302.72" dur="4.65">right and he was narrowly acquitted in</text>
  <text start="304.819" dur="4.831">1868 in the intense post-civil war</text>
  <text start="307.37" dur="3.479">reconstruction atmosphere you could</text>
  <text start="309.65" dur="4.019">probably imagine there was a lot of</text>
  <text start="310.849" dur="4.681">partisanship there too Richard Nixon was</text>
  <text start="313.669" dur="4.5">charged by the Judiciary Committee with</text>
  <text start="315.53" dur="4.259">having made it his policy to obstruct</text>
  <text start="318.169" dur="4.021">and having through his close</text>
  <text start="319.789" dur="5.491">subordinates and agents obstructed the</text>
  <text start="322.19" dur="6.479">Watergate investigation and of having</text>
  <text start="325.28" dur="5.699">endeavored to misuse the IRS not having</text>
  <text start="328.669" dur="5.43">actually done so as Franklin Roosevelt</text>
  <text start="330.979" dur="5.041">can DB Lyndon Johnson Obama and others</text>
  <text start="334.099" dur="3.511">have done and of impeding the</text>
  <text start="336.02" dur="3.119">impeachment proceedings by temporary</text>
  <text start="337.61" dur="3.66">non-compliance with House committee</text>
  <text start="339.139" dur="4.08">subpoenas the last was an obviously</text>
  <text start="341.27" dur="4.109">absurd charge but even the first two</text>
  <text start="343.219" dur="4.17">were not high crimes and there has never</text>
  <text start="345.379" dur="3.871">been any conclusive evidence that Nixon</text>
  <text start="347.389" dur="3.631">was guilty of them anyway but his</text>
  <text start="349.25" dur="3.36">impeachment case was a model of fairness</text>
  <text start="351.02" dur="3">compared with the president nonce</text>
  <text start="352.61" dur="3.059">present Mellon said excuse me</text>
  <text start="354.02" dur="3.48">President Clinton may have lied to a</text>
  <text start="355.669" dur="3.451">grand jury about his extramarital sex</text>
  <text start="357.5" dur="3.69">life but that was not a high crime</text>
  <text start="359.12" dur="3.72">either in constitutional terms and was</text>
  <text start="361.19" dur="4.77">rightly judge insufficient to justify</text>
  <text start="362.84" dur="5.759">his removal okay so that gives a little</text>
  <text start="365.96" dur="4.59">background of how it&amp;#39;s going down before</text>
  <text start="368.599" dur="3.421">and then of course the National Review</text>
  <text start="370.55" dur="3.78">says here the country must decide</text>
  <text start="372.02" dur="3.69">whether henceforth impeachment will be a</text>
  <text start="374.33" dur="3.239">routine clash between a House of</text>
  <text start="375.71" dur="3.179">Representatives and White House of</text>
  <text start="377.569" dur="4.081">different parties over policy</text>
  <text start="378.889" dur="5.46">differences or acute personal operations</text>
  <text start="381.65" dur="4.53">as this is or whether the authors of the</text>
  <text start="384.349" dur="3.66">Constitution mint and the national</text>
  <text start="386.18" dur="3.9">interest requires that it be reserved</text>
  <text start="388.009" dur="5.331">for accusations of high crimes on the</text>
  <text start="390.08" dur="5.699">same plane of misconduct as treason or</text>
  <text start="393.34" dur="4.96">bribe-taking and I think that a lot of</text>
  <text start="395.779" dur="4.051">sense of sensible Democrats are starting</text>
  <text start="398.3" dur="4.2">to realize that maybe they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="399.83" dur="4.98">the president but this sets a very scary</text>
  <text start="402.5" dur="4.229">precedent for them because indeed if</text>
  <text start="404.81" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;re democrat president president</text>
  <text start="406.729" dur="3.631">takes over when we start doing this too</text>
  <text start="408.11" dur="4.049">now we&amp;#39;ve got ourselves a true mess</text>
  <text start="410.36" dur="3.48">right let me take you down a little</text>
  <text start="412.159" dur="3.6">further right down here about halfway</text>
  <text start="413.84" dur="4.499">through this paragraph when this clunker</text>
  <text start="415.759" dur="4.56">limps out of a house after Pelosi has</text>

  <text start="422.719" dur="4.68">filter of their consciences the Senate</text>
  <text start="425.569" dur="4.35">should consider voting to send it to the</text>
  <text start="427.399" dur="4.89">Supreme Court to determine whether what</text>
  <text start="429.919" dur="4.441">is afoot is just a naked attempt to</text>
  <text start="432.289" dur="4.291">embarrass a partisan opponent as it is</text>
  <text start="434.36" dur="3.989">by attempting to incite public belief</text>
  <text start="436.58" dur="4.079">that President Trump may be guilty of a</text>
  <text start="438.349" dur="5.28">very serious offense without actually</text>
  <text start="440.659" dur="4.38">alleging one or citing evidence of one</text>
  <text start="443.629" dur="3.27">and there of course we&amp;#39;ve got a nice</text>

  <text start="451.789" dur="3.96">criminalization of policy differences</text>
  <text start="453.439" dur="5.301">but the defamatory rendering in legalese</text>

  <text start="477.199" dur="4.77">this is likely to die in the Senate</text>
  <text start="479.509" dur="4.05">anyway but it might not be a bad idea to</text>
  <text start="481.969" dur="3.75">take it up to the Supreme Court to</text>
  <text start="483.559" dur="4.051">really lay down the law and let people</text>
  <text start="485.719" dur="3.391">know that this is indeed is not the way</text>
  <text start="487.61" dur="3.389">to go you don&amp;#39;t just impeach a president</text>
  <text start="489.11" dur="3.539">just because you disagree with them or</text>
  <text start="490.999" dur="3.301">because you don&amp;#39;t like them we all</text>
  <text start="492.649" dur="3.091">understand that already I think most</text>
  <text start="494.3" dur="3.449">people who follow this channel know that</text>
  <text start="495.74" dur="3.479">there&amp;#39;s a bigger reason here this is the</text>
  <text start="497.749" dur="3.331">main talking point in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="499.219" dur="4.38">media for people who don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="501.08" dur="5.79">understand the true nature of the deeper</text>

  <text start="508.669" dur="4.381">partisanship kind of thing then you may</text>
  <text start="511.279" dur="3.75">want to start with the president at some</text>
  <text start="513.05" dur="4.14">point where you may at least want to see</text>
  <text start="515.029" dur="3.87">this play out but if you know the deeper</text>
  <text start="517.19" dur="3.42">corruption that&amp;#39;s going on you realize</text>
  <text start="518.899" dur="3.57">exactly why they&amp;#39;re trying to impeach</text>
  <text start="520.61" dur="4.65">this is just to stall to make sure that</text>
  <text start="522.469" dur="5.341">we don&amp;#39;t really get anything done and of</text>
  <text start="525.26" dur="4.949">course that&amp;#39;s dangerous too however this</text>
  <text start="527.81" dur="4.44">could lead us to be able to call all</text>
  <text start="530.209" dur="3.511">kinds of people of our own and then of</text>

  <text start="631.339" dur="3.48">keep in mind I know it&amp;#39;s hard to believe</text>
  <text start="633.29" dur="3.84">there&amp;#39;s still a lot of people who really</text>
  <text start="634.819" dur="4.14">like Hillary Clinton who really think</text>
  <text start="637.13" dur="4.079">that she was the one who got robbed in</text>

  <text start="643.01" dur="4.439">go through ladies and gentlemen this is</text>
  <text start="644.959" dur="3.69">not an easy task and what the Q team is</text>
  <text start="647.449" dur="3">trying to do what President Trump is</text>
  <text start="648.649" dur="4.261">trying to do is something that nobody&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="656" dur="5.279">know how that went down</text>
  <text start="657.829" dur="5.19">right so this isn&amp;#39;t easy and you know</text>
  <text start="661.279" dur="4.651">look if you&amp;#39;re not buying into it that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="665.93" dur="2.82">know it&amp;#39;s fine you can feel whatever you</text>
  <text start="667.069" dur="3.091">want about it but at the end of the day</text>
  <text start="668.75" dur="4.47">if this isn&amp;#39;t done with the letter of a</text>
  <text start="670.16" dur="5.429">law exactly showing the entire public</text>
  <text start="673.22" dur="5.01">how this went down this could all fall</text>

  <text start="678.23" dur="3.539">to think that it is this is going to be</text>
  <text start="679.819" dur="3.96">an incredible battle and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>

  <text start="721.34" dur="5.73">11:00 q adds on to post 37:24 down here</text>
  <text start="724.49" dur="6.75">you see we had a whole bunch of people</text>
  <text start="727.07" dur="8.19">fired forth from the FBI a bunch of</text>
  <text start="731.24" dur="7.17">people fired and forth from the DOJ a</text>
  <text start="735.26" dur="7.23">bunch of people fired and forth from</text>
  <text start="738.41" dur="5.94">this State Department people fired and</text>
  <text start="742.49" dur="3">forth but you get the idea we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="744.35" dur="3.84">talking about this for two years</text>
  <text start="745.49" dur="4.32">straight right q gave us a list of</text>
  <text start="748.19" dur="3.75">people fired from the FBI and of course</text>
  <text start="749.81" dur="5.31">off the top and that was James nobody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="751.94" dur="4.71">home Eko me right the DOJ we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="755.12" dur="2.67">this we&amp;#39;ve seen all the different people</text>
  <text start="756.65" dur="3.99">who have either been fired</text>
  <text start="757.79" dur="4.74">forced stepped down q has even told us</text>
  <text start="760.64" dur="4.17">who is cooperating who is not</text>
  <text start="762.53" dur="4.23">cooperating we&amp;#39;ve seen this and of</text>
  <text start="764.81" dur="5.19">course we&amp;#39;ve seen a complete cleaning</text>
  <text start="766.76" dur="5.07">out of the entire Trump admin to which</text>
  <text start="770" dur="3.42">many of his detractors would say you</text>
  <text start="771.83" dur="3.54">know that he is sort of operating this</text>
  <text start="773.42" dur="3.57">sinking ship when we realize that what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="775.37" dur="4.62">really going on is if this whole thing</text>
  <text start="776.99" dur="5.13">is getting gutted people fired him for</text>
  <text start="779.99" dur="4.17">us from the CIA Department of Defense</text>
  <text start="782.12" dur="3.42">Southern California and now I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="784.16" dur="3.12">kidding that&amp;#39;s the Supreme Court and</text>
  <text start="785.54" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;s why the Senate was so important</text>
  <text start="787.28" dur="4.5">because we&amp;#39;ve needed to hire and install</text>
  <text start="789.26" dur="4.65">Supreme Court judges federal judiciary</text>
  <text start="791.78" dur="3.96">which is extremely important when we</text>
  <text start="793.91" dur="3.96">start getting things to court right</text>
  <text start="795.74" dur="5.22">hired and installed new people at the</text>
  <text start="797.87" dur="5.31">DOJ new people at the CIA still does not</text>
  <text start="800.96" dur="4.71">have the intelligence they&amp;#39;re quite yeah</text>
  <text start="803.18" dur="4.29">either way I think the whole point is is</text>
  <text start="805.67" dur="3.84">that at some point we probably realized</text>
  <text start="807.47" dur="4.17">that this was going to come down to</text>
  <text start="809.51" dur="4.95">impeachment and in order to do that we</text>
  <text start="811.64" dur="3.42">needed to be locked and loaded so now</text>
  <text start="814.46" dur="2.13">it&amp;#39;s go time</text>
  <text start="815.06" dur="3.24">and it&amp;#39;s war and I know a lot of people</text>
  <text start="816.59" dur="3.9">are kind of emotional today about this</text>
  <text start="818.3" dur="3.78">whole thing personally I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="820.49" dur="2.849">guess I really kind of expected this</text>
  <text start="822.08" dur="2.46">this whole time I actually found it</text>
  <text start="823.339" dur="3.421">really odd there was somebody who</text>
  <text start="824.54" dur="4.919">commented on my last video Oh Patrick</text>
  <text start="826.76" dur="5.639">you and Q said that Trump would never be</text>
  <text start="829.459" dur="6.841">in Peach that&amp;#39;s not true that&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="832.399" dur="7.021">I didn&amp;#39;t say that so that&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="836.3" dur="4.92">anyway the idea is that we knew this was</text>
  <text start="839.42" dur="3.479">gonna come to a head right and in order</text>
  <text start="841.22" dur="4.53">to get this all done we needed to lock</text>
  <text start="842.899" dur="4.921">and load all of these departments and</text>
  <text start="845.75" dur="3.54">it&amp;#39;s a massive cleaning this is not an</text>
  <text start="847.82" dur="3.42">easy deal but not a lot of that these</text>
  <text start="849.29" dur="4.5">people wanted to go quietly either right</text>
  <text start="851.24" dur="4.59">so we have a list of this we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="853.79" dur="3.21">this and there&amp;#39;s an extensive list we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="855.83" dur="3.06">not even talking about all the different</text>
  <text start="857" dur="3.959">CEOs of different companies who have</text>
  <text start="858.89" dur="4.889">stepped down there is somebody I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="860.959" dur="4.44">have it right now but I guarantee you if</text>
  <text start="863.779" dur="3.301">you scroll through the comments of this</text>
  <text start="865.399" dur="3.481">video somebody will probably give us a</text>
  <text start="867.08" dur="3.69">link to the Google a spreadsheet</text>
  <text start="868.88" dur="4.17">somebody kept a massive google</text>
  <text start="870.77" dur="3.93">spreadsheet of all the different CEO</text>
  <text start="873.05" dur="3.479">resignations and whatnot it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="874.7" dur="3.63">brilliant and there are thousands of</text>
  <text start="876.529" dur="3.331">them and it&amp;#39;s really hard for you to</text>
  <text start="878.33" dur="3.84">take a look at a spreadsheet like that</text>
  <text start="879.86" dur="5.219">and really not see how overwhelmingly</text>
  <text start="882.17" dur="4.38">deep this really runs so this is a big</text>
  <text start="885.079" dur="3.57">deal and we&amp;#39;re part of something really</text>
  <text start="886.55" dur="3.69">special here so I know that if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="888.649" dur="4.291">feeling kind of emotional about it today</text>
  <text start="890.24" dur="4.95">I feel you but keep in mind that this is</text>
  <text start="892.94" dur="3.57">a long time coming for this plan too and</text>
  <text start="895.19" dur="3.93">if we want to do it we need to do it</text>
  <text start="896.51" dur="4.319">right let&amp;#39;s move on post 37 26 40</text>
  <text start="899.12" dur="3.39">minutes after the hour of 12:00 we get a</text>
  <text start="900.829" dur="4.441">couple of Fox links right here they are</text>
  <text start="902.51" dur="5.04">both part of the bill bar interview and</text>
  <text start="905.27" dur="4.86">both of them are about 30-second clips</text>
  <text start="907.55" dur="10.74">so I made you a little mini montage a</text>
  <text start="910.13" dur="10.769">min Taj believed that germs</text>
  <text start="918.29" dur="4.739">investigation is broader scoped in terms</text>
  <text start="920.899" dur="4.801">of the intelligence agencies that are</text>
  <text start="923.029" dur="4.68">being looked at oh yes you know he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="925.7" dur="4.32">just looking at the FBI he&amp;#39;s looking at</text>
  <text start="927.709" dur="6.291">other agencies and also private and</text>
  <text start="930.02" dur="7.379">departments and also private actors and</text>
  <text start="934" dur="6.25">so it&amp;#39;s a much broader investigation and</text>
  <text start="937.399" dur="6.031">also he&amp;#39;s not just looking at the FISA</text>
  <text start="940.25" dur="4.75">aspect of it he is looking at all the</text>
  <text start="943.43" dur="4.48">conduct both</text>
  <text start="945" dur="5.55">for and after the election he said I was</text>
  <text start="947.91" dur="4.98">seven steps removed from what was going</text>
  <text start="950.55" dur="4.38">on the director doesn&amp;#39;t get involved in</text>
  <text start="952.89" dur="4.7">these kinds of things the actual</text>
  <text start="954.93" dur="5.67">investigation do you believe that no I</text>
  <text start="957.59" dur="5.44">think that the one of the problems with</text>
  <text start="960.6" dur="4.56">what happened was precisely that they</text>
  <text start="963.03" dur="5.61">pulled the investigation up to the</text>
  <text start="965.16" dur="6">executive floors and it was run and bird</text>
  <text start="968.64" dur="5.43">dogged by a very small group of very</text>
  <text start="971.16" dur="5.34">high-level officials and the idea that</text>
  <text start="974.07" dur="4.62">this was seven layers below him is</text>
  <text start="976.5" dur="3.87">simply not true so there you go just a</text>
  <text start="978.69" dur="3.48">couple of clips from the bill Barr</text>
  <text start="980.37" dur="3.12">interview with Martha McCallum I have</text>
  <text start="982.17" dur="3.54">yet to see it myself I&amp;#39;ve been covering</text>
  <text start="983.49" dur="3.21">this all day but it should prove to be</text>
  <text start="985.71" dur="2.43">pretty interesting</text>
  <text start="986.7" dur="3.66">the first part there he is obviously</text>
  <text start="988.14" dur="4.32">talking about Durham&amp;#39;s investigation at</text>
  <text start="990.36" dur="4.35">how wide scoping this really is he</text>
  <text start="992.46" dur="4.47">mentioned numerous agencies this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="994.71" dur="4.59">just into Phi sub use remember FISA was</text>
  <text start="996.93" dur="4.14">only the cover-up of something so much</text>
  <text start="999.3" dur="4.62">more massive so that should be really</text>
  <text start="1001.07" dur="4.65">good news to the ear and the second part</text>
  <text start="1003.92" dur="4.38">he is responding to you James commis</text>
  <text start="1005.72" dur="4.77">claimed that he was seven layers removed</text>
  <text start="1008.3" dur="3.33">from this investigation we all know</text>
  <text start="1010.49" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="1011.63" dur="3.57">seven layers when is this a Chipotle</text>
  <text start="1014.75" dur="2.73">burrito</text>
