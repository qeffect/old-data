  <text start="131.58" dur="3.12">to people who have not seen them because</text>
  <text start="133.29" dur="2.85">they&amp;#39;re very curious stuff and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="134.7" dur="2.94">lot of really great stuff for all of us</text>
  <text start="136.14" dur="3.42">to pick up are you guys havin fun with</text>
  <text start="137.64" dur="3.63">some really good stuff but this is one</text>
  <text start="139.56" dur="3.09">of those entrances right there you know</text>
  <text start="141.27" dur="3.12">when you just want to get off the cruise</text>
  <text start="142.65" dur="3.48">and finally get away from it all right</text>
  <text start="144.39" dur="3.99">and here&amp;#39;s the other one here it looks</text>
  <text start="146.13" dur="4.2">like this first one is actually up the</text>
  <text start="148.38" dur="3.12">hill right here but this is the second</text>
  <text start="150.33" dur="2.489">one it looks like you probably even get</text>
  <text start="151.5" dur="4.319">a little vehicle in there you never know</text>
  <text start="152.819" dur="4.471">but those look like tunnels anyway so</text>
  <text start="155.819" dur="3.78">this is what you get when you go to st.</text>
  <text start="157.29" dur="3.72">James Ireland yikes okay now please</text>
  <text start="159.599" dur="2.851">understand because of the sheer amount</text>
  <text start="161.01" dur="3.66">of queue that we have I don&amp;#39;t have time</text>
  <text start="162.45" dur="3.63">to go way off onto this subject but I do</text>
  <text start="164.67" dur="3.32">want to start you off on a couple of</text>
  <text start="166.08" dur="3.69">interesting connections first of all</text>
  <text start="167.99" dur="3.46">it&amp;#39;s not no sir</text>
  <text start="169.77" dur="4.26">that Cruise Lines would go to the Virgin</text>
  <text start="171.45" dur="4.47">Islands which is of course epstein</text>
  <text start="174.03" dur="3.87">territory and as you can see here it is</text>
  <text start="175.92" dur="3.51">new Cruise Lines is no different so</text>
  <text start="177.9" dur="2.85">that&amp;#39;s not necessarily nefarious on its</text>
  <text start="179.43" dur="3.74">own but the fact that it does go to</text>
  <text start="180.75" dur="5.16">little st. James should be rather</text>
  <text start="183.17" dur="3.85">alarming now I also want to point out</text>
  <text start="185.91" dur="4.2">that Epstein</text>
  <text start="187.02" dur="6.06">he owns a marina out there in st. Thomas</text>
  <text start="190.11" dur="5.31">and he went in on that with this guy</text>
  <text start="193.08" dur="4.8">named Andrew Farkas and Andrew Farkas</text>
  <text start="195.42" dur="5.76">comes from the Alexander&amp;#39;s department</text>
  <text start="197.88" dur="5.46">store family and yeah they owned a they</text>
  <text start="201.18" dur="4.83">call it in this is from Bloomberg right</text>
  <text start="203.34" dur="6.99">here but they called it a small marina</text>
  <text start="206.01" dur="5.73">but it&amp;#39;s 127 slips that&amp;#39;s not that small</text>
  <text start="210.33" dur="3.6">I just wanna point that out</text>
  <text start="211.74" dur="4.11">so he went in with this guy Andrew</text>
  <text start="213.93" dur="4.2">Farkas and I want to talk about him just</text>
  <text start="215.85" dur="4.23">a little bit because he may be coming</text>
  <text start="218.13" dur="4.02">into the news pretty soon too and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="220.08" dur="4.44">part of this group called island capital</text>
  <text start="222.15" dur="4.14">capital group he&amp;#39;s been around for a</text>
  <text start="224.52" dur="2.97">long time and there&amp;#39;s a lot of things</text>
  <text start="226.29" dur="4.32">you could probably make a whole video</text>
  <text start="227.49" dur="6.66">just on this guy but this is the guy</text>
  <text start="230.61" dur="6.27">right here and him and his group before</text>
  <text start="234.15" dur="5.07">Island capital they went and built this</text>
  <text start="236.88" dur="4.68">or excuse me acquired this tower out</text>
  <text start="239.22" dur="4.38">there in southern Florida and you may</text>
  <text start="241.56" dur="4.32">know this tower it&amp;#39;s the Northbridge</text>
  <text start="243.6" dur="5.88">Center otherwise known as Darth Vader</text>
  <text start="245.88" dur="6.18">and his group which was part of this</text>
  <text start="249.48" dur="4.95">acquisition along with the Vanderbilt</text>
  <text start="252.06" dur="4.2">office properties and of course that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="254.43" dur="2.94">them right there and I think we all know</text>
  <text start="256.26" dur="1.8">what we&amp;#39;re talking about what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="257.37" dur="2.4">talking about</text>
  <text start="258.06" dur="4.56">Vanderbilt&amp;#39;s right so there&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="259.77" dur="5.04">odd connection there too now I also want</text>
  <text start="262.62" dur="4.47">to point out that let&amp;#39;s go back to Andre</text>

  <text start="375.78" dur="4.5">ok so Jeffrey Epstein had a partnership</text>
  <text start="377.969" dur="3.771">in this marina with this Andrew Farkas</text>
  <text start="380.28" dur="4.41">who we&amp;#39;re just gonna call Hasty Pudding</text>
  <text start="381.74" dur="5.29">well back in the day 2006 Hasty Pudding</text>
  <text start="384.69" dur="5.19">put a little coin into another Andrew</text>
  <text start="387.03" dur="6.15">Andrew Cuomo that&amp;#39;s right this is from</text>
  <text start="389.88" dur="5.55">The Voice Village Voice August 29 2006</text>
  <text start="393.18" dur="4.68">the most important man in Andrew Cuomo&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="395.43" dur="5.459">personal and political life topping even</text>
  <text start="397.86" dur="5.25">his ex governor&amp;#39;s father is obscure 46</text>
  <text start="400.889" dur="4.291">year old developer Andrew Farkas whose</text>
  <text start="403.11" dur="3.54">pony dup over 2 million dollars for the</text>
  <text start="405.18" dur="3.93">front-running attorney general candidate</text>
  <text start="406.65" dur="4.47">in recent years that includes 1.2</text>
  <text start="409.11" dur="5.07">million dollars in salary that Farkas is</text>
  <text start="411.12" dur="6.81">from Island Capital paid Cuomo in 2004</text>
  <text start="414.18" dur="6.6">and 2005 as well as over $800,000 in</text>
  <text start="417.93" dur="5.549">identifiable campaign contributions from</text>
  <text start="420.78" dur="4.77">verified Farkas companies family members</text>
  <text start="423.479" dur="4.261">and business associates it does not</text>
  <text start="425.55" dur="5.489">include an undisclosed amount Island</text>
  <text start="427.74" dur="5.97">paid cuomo up to June 2006 okay so we</text>
  <text start="431.039" dur="6.031">have an undisclosed amount paid to Cuomo</text>
  <text start="433.71" dur="6.33">when Cuomo left finally left the company</text>
  <text start="437.07" dur="6.27">specializes in Dubai and Caribbean</text>
  <text start="440.04" dur="4.05">luxury marinas well how about that right</text>
  <text start="443.34" dur="4.34">there</text>
  <text start="444.09" dur="5.97">luxury marinas in Dubai and the</text>
  <text start="447.68" dur="3.55">Caribbean well my learnings tripled when</text>
  <text start="450.06" dur="3.39">he went to work in Island where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="451.23" dur="5.1">made more money than at any other time</text>
  <text start="453.45" dur="4.2">in his life okay so this goes on to say</text>
  <text start="456.33" dur="3.93">the weird part about this is that Cuomo</text>
  <text start="457.65" dur="3.9">actually turned against his buddy it</text>
  <text start="460.26" dur="3.36">says right here Cuomo personally</text>
  <text start="461.55" dur="5.16">authorized the filing of a civil suit by</text>
  <text start="463.62" dur="5.55">federal prosecutors in 1997 that accused</text>
  <text start="466.71" dur="4.17">Farkas then company in Sydney of</text>
  <text start="469.17" dur="3.84">financial services are paying seven</text>
  <text start="470.88" dur="4.71">point six million in kickbacks to the</text>
  <text start="473.01" dur="7.05">owners of the 17 federally subsidized</text>
  <text start="475.59" dur="6.12">projects that Insignia managed no I</text>
  <text start="480.06" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s actually relevant here</text>
  <text start="481.71" dur="4.68">but anyway so I want to just point out</text>
  <text start="484.41" dur="4.98">this part down here because this was a</text>
  <text start="486.39" dur="5.19">long time ago Cuomo repeatedly mentioned</text>
  <text start="489.39" dur="3.96">that Farkas is a financial guy who he</text>
  <text start="491.58" dur="4.35">believes never saw one of the properties</text>
  <text start="493.35" dur="4.5">he managed suggesting that this distance</text>
  <text start="495.93" dur="4.05">made him less responsible for the</text>
  <text start="497.85" dur="3.6">conditions okay well that was what I</text>
  <text start="499.98" dur="3.54">wanted to point out because here we go</text>
  <text start="501.45" dur="4.11">with another money guy who&amp;#39;s got a</text>
  <text start="503.52" dur="3.87">reputation for not really overseeing all</text>
  <text start="505.56" dur="4.14">these properties he just seems to</text>
  <text start="507.39" dur="4.86">acquire him that sounds really familiar</text>
  <text start="509.7" dur="5.07">and I am of course referring to earlier</text>
  <text start="512.25" dur="5.7">this year when we talked about Cynthia</text>
  <text start="514.77" dur="4.92">Beck another real estate mogul who was</text>
  <text start="517.95" dur="4.35">actually rested she spent some time in</text>
  <text start="519.69" dur="4.14">jail and they released her but she was</text>
  <text start="522.3" dur="3.36">out Gordon Gettys mistress as a matter</text>
  <text start="523.83" dur="5.04">of fact they have children together but</text>
  <text start="525.66" dur="5.94">this was our LA raid that we saw up in</text>
  <text start="528.87" dur="4.02">northern LA and Bel Air and if you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="531.6" dur="3.57">remember she had a whole bunch of</text>
  <text start="532.89" dur="3.81">properties listed to her name one of</text>
  <text start="535.17" dur="4.05">course was where they found all these</text>
  <text start="536.7" dur="6.39">guns but all a lot of her properties</text>
  <text start="539.22" dur="6">were also ill maintained yeah exactly</text>
  <text start="543.09" dur="3.99">now this is all for heavy calm which I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="545.22" dur="3.06">not a big fan of but I brought it down</text>
  <text start="547.08" dur="3.18">here because I wanted to show you</text>
  <text start="548.28" dur="4.89">something this is from actually an old</text>
  <text start="550.26" dur="5.64">video from some years back but this is</text>
  <text start="553.17" dur="4.32">one of her properties that some kids</text>
  <text start="555.9" dur="4.29">made a video but if you&amp;#39;ll take a look</text>
  <text start="557.49" dur="4.86">at that entranceway right there I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="560.19" dur="4.17">you will see what we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="562.35" dur="4.5">very very creepy and look at those blue</text>
  <text start="564.36" dur="3.81">and white stripes mmm it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="566.85" dur="3.36">we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="568.17" dur="3.75">before so I&amp;#39;m not necessarily directly</text>
  <text start="570.21" dur="2.75">tying them but I&amp;#39;m just pointing out</text>
  <text start="571.92" dur="3.6">that these are two real-estate</text>
  <text start="572.96" dur="4.33">developers that seem to have a habit of</text>
  <text start="575.52" dur="5.49">not taking care of their properties and</text>
  <text start="577.29" dur="6.3">of course Cynthia Beck was found to be</text>
  <text start="581.01" dur="3.03">running this they arrested this other</text>
