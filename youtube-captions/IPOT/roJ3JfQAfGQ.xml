  <text start="61.42" dur="3.48">deep into this because this is just a</text>

  <text start="64.9" dur="5.19">needs to charge their phone but there</text>
  <text start="67.96" dur="3.69">was some talk on a coon as to whether or</text>

  <text start="71.65" dur="4.23">turns out it was not in queue states</text>

  <text start="75.88" dur="5.01">start where Q points out that it is fake</text>
  <text start="78.7" dur="5.1">sometimes silence is necessary in order</text>
  <text start="80.89" dur="4.53">to protect select public releases and</text>
  <text start="83.8" dur="4.23">before we go on I want to highlight this</text>
  <text start="85.42" dur="3.87">very curious looking JPEG right here</text>
  <text start="88.03" dur="3.24">we&amp;#39;re starting to find some interesting</text>
  <text start="89.29" dur="3.63">things in here and maybe at some point</text>
  <text start="91.27" dur="3.57">when we see a final connection I&amp;#39;ll make</text>
  <text start="92.92" dur="3.93">a video on this but I want to point out</text>
  <text start="94.84" dur="4.11">that it seems like there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="96.85" dur="4.769">different key searches here in these</text>
  <text start="98.95" dur="4.23">JPEGs anyway sometimes silence is</text>
  <text start="101.619" dur="4.591">necessary in order to protect select</text>

  <text start="106.21" dur="3.48">public statements past week we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="108.25" dur="3.509">talk a little bit more about a statement</text>
  <text start="109.69" dur="3.66">in a future post here but he obviously</text>
  <text start="111.759" dur="3.691">came out saying that he didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="113.35" dur="2.91">agree with the IG report right he seemed</text>
  <text start="115.45" dur="2.25">to think that there was some</text>
  <text start="116.26" dur="3.66">knuckleheaded we going on and of course</text>
  <text start="117.7" dur="4.26">we already knew that Durham public</text>
  <text start="119.92" dur="3.48">statements past week same similar thing</text>
  <text start="121.96" dur="3.45">and he says I&amp;#39;ve got criminal</text>
  <text start="123.4" dur="4.29">investigations to show for it</text>
  <text start="125.41" dur="5.93">Durham start cue start right around the</text>
  <text start="127.69" dur="5.94">same time right 28th to October 2017 I</text>
  <text start="131.34" dur="3.79">know now there&amp;#39;s some argument as to</text>
  <text start="133.63" dur="3.12">whether or not there was actually in the</text>
  <text start="135.13" dur="4.109">same day but it was about a 24 hour</text>
  <text start="136.75" dur="4.5">period at the very least but either way</text>
  <text start="139.239" dur="3.481">it was still very curious right so</text>
  <text start="141.25" dur="4.769">Durham has been flying under the radar</text>
  <text start="142.72" dur="5.01">for quite some time not so much anymore</text>
  <text start="146.019" dur="3.961">did you learn for physis last week</text>
  <text start="147.73" dur="5.13">regarding POTUS no we we learned for</text>
  <text start="149.98" dur="5.009">physis last year regarding POTUS we</text>
  <text start="152.86" dur="3.51">covered FISA extensively if you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="154.989" dur="4.081">following my channel for quite some time</text>
  <text start="156.37" dur="5.61">you know this we have covered this quite</text>
  <text start="159.07" dur="4.68">extensively now going back to this for</text>
  <text start="161.98" dur="3.3">those of you who are newer I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="163.75" dur="3.57">gonna cruise through this post a little</text>
  <text start="165.28" dur="4.14">bit to give you a general idea but this</text>
  <text start="167.32" dur="4.71">was a special approval club code for a</text>
  <text start="169.42" dur="4.95">visa that was set up by aunt Loretta</text>
  <text start="172.03" dur="5.34">Lynch who evidently left a paper trail</text>
  <text start="174.37" dur="3.42">for a special entry for Natalia Veselin</text>
  <text start="177.37" dur="3.39">skaia</text>
  <text start="177.79" dur="4.47">that ended up to leading to a meeting</text>
  <text start="180.76" dur="3.1">with manna 4 which led to these four</text>
  <text start="182.26" dur="2.83">fights of warrants the</text>
  <text start="183.86" dur="2.97">that&amp;#39;s been public that we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="185.09" dur="3.63">likely talk about the most has been the</text>
  <text start="186.83" dur="4.44">Carter page one who has never been</text>
  <text start="188.72" dur="4.2">charged with a crime then of course</text>
  <text start="191.27" dur="3.63">you&amp;#39;ve got George Poppa dropping us and</text>
  <text start="192.92" dur="4.23">he did serve a little bit of time not</text>
  <text start="194.9" dur="4.44">very much but he seems to think he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="197.15" dur="4.29">going to be very vindicated very soon</text>
  <text start="199.34" dur="5.1">and then of course you&amp;#39;ve got Flynn and</text>
  <text start="201.44" dur="4.74">his sentencing keeps getting moved down</text>
  <text start="204.44" dur="3.18">the line there&amp;#39;s a specific reason for</text>
  <text start="206.18" dur="4.08">that because finally when this whole</text>
  <text start="207.62" dur="4.47">thing falls apart so will the case and</text>
  <text start="210.26" dur="3.9">Flynn will never even need to be</text>
  <text start="212.09" dur="3.69">pardoned it will just be thrown out and</text>
  <text start="214.16" dur="3.9">of course he will be hopefully</text>
  <text start="215.78" dur="4.62">completely vindicated as he should be</text>
  <text start="218.06" dur="4.86">and then of course you&amp;#39;ve got my most</text>
  <text start="220.4" dur="4.65">curious character Manta Ford who&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="222.92" dur="2.66">put away hard which seems to suggest to</text>
  <text start="225.05" dur="3.84">me</text>
  <text start="225.58" dur="4.629">Manta fort has a lot on these people but</text>
  <text start="228.89" dur="2.43">either way these were the four fights</text>
  <text start="230.209" dur="2.671">and warrants that we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="231.32" dur="4.02">and then they talk about the umbrella</text>
  <text start="232.88" dur="4.56">surveillance okay so I&amp;#39;m spying on P but</text>
  <text start="235.34" dur="4.02">P is talking to X so now I got a spy on</text>
  <text start="237.44" dur="4.65">X and X starts talking to why so now I</text>
  <text start="239.36" dur="5.25">got a spy on Y and all their friends so</text>
  <text start="242.09" dur="5.03">on and so forth so this leads to a lot</text>
  <text start="244.61" dur="4.05">of spying bulk data collection umbrella</text>
  <text start="247.12" dur="2.53">surveillance and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="248.66" dur="3.45">talking about that&amp;#39;s how they</text>
  <text start="249.65" dur="4.68">essentially got to President Trump if</text>
  <text start="252.11" dur="3.48">you really went and put a fire out on</text>
  <text start="254.33" dur="3.48">President Trump which you couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="255.59" dur="3.679">because he&amp;#39;s not a foreign national you</text>
  <text start="257.81" dur="3.6">would never be able to get that approved</text>
  <text start="259.269" dur="3.941">or at least I should say in a perfect</text>
  <text start="261.41" dur="3.63">world you&amp;#39;d never get that approved but</text>
  <text start="263.21" dur="4.89">keep in mind President Trump wasn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="265.04" dur="5.189">first one Ted Cruz was likely one of the</text>
  <text start="268.1" dur="3.84">first okay so this led to a ton of</text>
  <text start="270.229" dur="3.961">spying lots of people were getting spied</text>
  <text start="271.94" dur="4.89">on and of course he&amp;#39;s unofficial five</text>
  <text start="274.19" dur="5.58">eyes contacts we&amp;#39;re helping people do it</text>
  <text start="276.83" dur="5.88">right so we did learn four or five says</text>
  <text start="279.77" dur="4.11">last week in the mainstream news but if</text>
  <text start="282.71" dur="2.519">you&amp;#39;ve been following this channel for a</text>
  <text start="283.88" dur="2.06">while you&amp;#39;ve known about it for quite</text>
  <text start="285.229" dur="2.971">some time</text>
  <text start="285.94" dur="3.55">non-public prior were like I just said</text>
  <text start="288.2" dur="3">it was Carter Paige was the only one</text>
  <text start="289.49" dur="3.57">that was supposed to be public then Q</text>
  <text start="291.2" dur="4.23">just said sometimes silence is necessary</text>
  <text start="293.06" dur="4.95">in order to protect select public</text>
  <text start="295.43" dur="4.5">releases that very well could be because</text>
  <text start="298.01" dur="4.2">there&amp;#39;s criminal investigations related</text>
  <text start="299.93" dur="3.45">with those don&amp;#39;t know we won&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="302.21" dur="2.519">until they&amp;#39;re released but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="303.38" dur="4.289">obviously a reason why they&amp;#39;re keeping</text>
  <text start="304.729" dur="4.951">it private right crews fyz it FISA</text>
  <text start="307.669" dur="3.241">public soon yeah and he&amp;#39;s gonna break it</text>

  <text start="337.14" dur="4.95">made last week what must that signal</text>
  <text start="339.66" dur="5.1">well pretty obvious right I suppose if a</text>
  <text start="342.09" dur="4.14">b-2 bomber is flying stealthily overhead</text>
  <text start="344.76" dur="3.72">you&amp;#39;re not aware of it so you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="346.23" dur="4.02">aware of the danger but if the b-2</text>
  <text start="348.48" dur="5.43">bomber is no longer stealth and it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="350.25" dur="6.09">not a b-2 stealth bomber it&amp;#39;s a b2</text>
  <text start="353.91" dur="4.11">in-your-face bomber I guess I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="356.34" dur="3.93">what the technical term is for that but</text>
  <text start="358.02" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ll call it anyway now you</text>
  <text start="360.27" dur="4.46">look up and you say hey that&amp;#39;s a b2</text>
  <text start="362.13" dur="4.86">in-your-face bomber flying overhead</text>
  <text start="364.73" dur="5.23">which leads me to wonder if it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="366.99" dur="4.56">drop a bomb on my face which is a pretty</text>
  <text start="369.96" dur="3.06">fair question to ask when you see it</text>

  <text start="729.25" dur="3.14">specific reason other than the fact that</text>
  <text start="730.75" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;re just doing your everyday thing</text>
  <text start="732.39" dur="4.57">you don&amp;#39;t really have much time for news</text>
  <text start="734.65" dur="3.6">so you only get what comes to you and of</text>
  <text start="736.96" dur="3.3">course what comes to you is what&amp;#39;s off</text>
  <text start="738.25" dur="4.35">mainstream media and print right is that</text>
  <text start="740.26" dur="3.93">Trump is bad orange man bad Russia</text>
  <text start="742.6" dur="3.12">Russia Russia all these kinds of things</text>
  <text start="744.19" dur="4.02">he&amp;#39;s a racist he&amp;#39;s or whatever and you</text>
  <text start="745.72" dur="4.62">know what it is so here you are hating</text>
  <text start="748.21" dur="3.96">Trump not really understanding why you</text>
  <text start="750.34" dur="3.06">know he messed with Russia at least</text>
  <text start="752.17" dur="3.42">that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re being told you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="753.4" dur="4.02">exactly sure what it means but you just</text>
  <text start="755.59" dur="5.1">feel like he&amp;#39;s messed around with Russia</text>
  <text start="757.42" dur="4.92">all of sudden after a while we start</text>
  <text start="760.69" dur="4.11">getting this narrative showing that</text>
  <text start="762.34" dur="4.86">there were investigations going on back</text>
  <text start="764.8" dur="4.95">in 2015 well we didn&amp;#39;t know that Trump</text>
  <text start="767.2" dur="3.81">was gonna win back in 2015 as a matter</text>
  <text start="769.75" dur="3.93">of fact Trump didn&amp;#39;t even enter the</text>
  <text start="771.01" dur="4.56">picture then like I said they were</text>
  <text start="773.68" dur="3.24">already working on Ted Cruz by the time</text>
  <text start="775.57" dur="3.96">they got in to be spies and warrants</text>
  <text start="776.92" dur="4.47">they were already covering up their</text>
  <text start="779.53" dur="4.14">spying the FISA was to make it look</text>
  <text start="781.39" dur="4.74">legit but this was going on for a very</text>
  <text start="783.67" dur="4.35">very long time so the importance of this</text>
  <text start="786.13" dur="4.17">like I&amp;#39;m saying is if you are that</text>
  <text start="788.02" dur="4.77">average everyday person who hates Trump</text>
  <text start="790.3" dur="4.38">but doesn&amp;#39;t really know why chances are</text>
  <text start="792.79" dur="3.72">you might be a little bit more easily</text>
  <text start="794.68" dur="3.84">swayed if you start to see that this</text>
  <text start="796.51" dur="4.47">story took place before Trump was even</text>
  <text start="798.52" dur="4.29">in the picture of the story it gets so</text>
  <text start="800.98" dur="3.3">hard to blame Trump when he&amp;#39;s not even a</text>
  <text start="802.81" dur="3.57">part of the picture at this point now</text>
  <text start="804.28" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;re talking about Ted Cruz okay well I</text>
  <text start="806.38" dur="3.48">don&amp;#39;t really like Ted Cruz but geez that</text>
  <text start="808.03" dur="4.86">seems a little unfair you see what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="809.86" dur="5.19">saying this whole thing went down before</text>
  <text start="812.89" dur="4.62">they even took Trump seriously and</text>
  <text start="815.05" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s so important because if</text>
  <text start="817.51" dur="4.35">you already have such a hardcore bias</text>
  <text start="819.52" dur="4.29">like the media has been planting for so</text>
  <text start="821.86" dur="3.69">long against Trump you&amp;#39;re gonna hate</text>
  <text start="823.81" dur="3.54">Trump regardless but if you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="825.55" dur="3.75">really sure why you&amp;#39;re just thinking</text>
  <text start="827.35" dur="3.24">that you know I&amp;#39;m just giving you know</text>
  <text start="829.3" dur="2.61">kind of taking in what the news is</text>
  <text start="830.59" dur="3.3">giving me or whatever and then all of a</text>
  <text start="831.91" dur="4.8">sudden you realize wait a minute all</text>
  <text start="833.89" dur="5.55">this went on years ago before Trump even</text>
  <text start="836.71" dur="4.83">really became a serious candidate that</text>
  <text start="839.44" dur="3.93">doesn&amp;#39;t seem like Trump&amp;#39;s fault you get</text>
