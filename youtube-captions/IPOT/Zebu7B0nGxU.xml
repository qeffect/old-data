  <text start="983.589" dur="5.7">stuff now I suppose we could argue the</text>

  <text start="989.289" dur="4.08">our boy Jeffrey Epstein had that Sorrell</text>

  <text start="993.369" dur="4.77">see if I can connect on at least a</text>

  <text start="1001.23" dur="5.19">gave a lot of money or excuse me Epstein</text>
  <text start="1003.33" dur="5.22">gave a lot of money to his campaign now</text>
  <text start="1006.42" dur="5.16">you&amp;#39;ve got Bill Richardson who went out</text>

  <text start="1020.7" dur="4.889">those servers hmm</text>
  <text start="1022.77" dur="5.97">now think about Google parent company</text>
  <text start="1025.589" dur="6.061">alphabet Sergey Brin big founder all</text>
  <text start="1028.74" dur="6.27">these knuckleheads and of course he was</text>
  <text start="1031.65" dur="6.78">married to Anne Wojcicki and will jiske</text>
  <text start="1035.01" dur="4.92">from 23andme human genome you send them</text>
  <text start="1038.43" dur="3.269">their DNA and they tell you where you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1041.699" dur="2.88">and what kind of foods you should eat</text>
  <text start="1042.99" dur="3.9">bla bla bla bla but the fact of the</text>
  <text start="1044.579" dur="4.981">matter is is that both of them are</text>
  <text start="1046.89" dur="4.71">gathering your data Google is gathering</text>
  <text start="1049.56" dur="4.71">all kinds of data from you and of course</text>
  <text start="1051.6" dur="4.35">23andme a company like this gathers you</text>
  <text start="1054.27" dur="4.74">DNA and of course that&amp;#39;s the ultimate</text>
  <text start="1055.95" dur="5.46">form of data right this is the big big</text>
  <text start="1059.01" dur="4.17">thing then of course Jeffrey Epstein he</text>
  <text start="1061.41" dur="4.05">had himself a little plan to inseminate</text>
  <text start="1063.18" dur="4.26">the human race out there right he wanted</text>
  <text start="1065.46" dur="3.69">to do a little sperm donation bank out</text>
  <text start="1067.44" dur="3.81">there at the Sorrell ranch so I think</text>
  <text start="1069.15" dur="4.74">you see what&amp;#39;s going on he was trying to</text>
  <text start="1071.25" dur="3.99">create himself a little super race and I</text>
  <text start="1073.89" dur="4.2">suppose that would involve some of this</text>
  <text start="1075.24" dur="5.01">CRISPR genome editing the Rockefeller</text>
  <text start="1078.09" dur="5.69">University that Epstein just happened to</text>
  <text start="1080.25" dur="5.61">sit on the board of his researching now</text>
  <text start="1083.78" dur="4.81">you&amp;#39;ve probably recognized that name</text>
  <text start="1085.86" dur="5.37">well jiske because Anne Wojcicki sister</text>
  <text start="1088.59" dur="6.09">is of course CEO of YouTube and on</text>
  <text start="1091.23" dur="7.14">permanent cake ban list Susan Wojcicki</text>
  <text start="1094.68" dur="6.78">so Patrick what is this CRISPR prey tail</text>
  <text start="1098.37" dur="4.86">of which you speak well I couldn&amp;#39;t speak</text>
  <text start="1101.46" dur="3.93">intelligently about it but you know who</text>
  <text start="1103.23" dur="4.83">can function from the Broad Institute</text>
  <text start="1105.39" dur="4.65">and I want to thank Ann Ann on who sent</text>
  <text start="1108.06" dur="3.99">me off in this direction let&amp;#39;s have him</text>
  <text start="1110.04" dur="5.18">give us a little basic explanation on</text>
  <text start="1112.05" dur="3.17">how CRISPR works</text>
  <text start="1117.35" dur="6.91">for for a long time now we have known</text>
  <text start="1120.99" dur="5.85">genetic mutations that underlie diseases</text>
  <text start="1124.26" dur="4.92">and so one of the class is if we know</text>
  <text start="1126.84" dur="4.14">what mutations cause disease why not</text>
  <text start="1129.18" dur="3.78">just go in and replace that thing to</text>
  <text start="1130.98" dur="5.25">divert it back to the normal sequence in</text>
  <text start="1132.96" dur="5.79">CRISPR is a technology that we harness</text>
  <text start="1136.23" dur="4.47">from bacterial cells to be able to make</text>
  <text start="1138.75" dur="4.95">those precise changes in the human</text>
  <text start="1140.7" dur="5.19">genome and in the way it works is</text>
  <text start="1143.7" dur="4.83">imagine if you are writing a novel and</text>
  <text start="1145.89" dur="4.95">you are proofreading the novel and there</text>
  <text start="1148.53" dur="4.08">are some titles you want to fix and</text>
  <text start="1150.84" dur="3.87">let&amp;#39;s say the sentence in the novel said</text>
  <text start="1152.61" dur="4.08">twinkle twinkle they start but they</text>
  <text start="1154.71" dur="3.9">really want to fix it so that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1156.69" dur="3.71">twinkle twinkle little star there are</text>
  <text start="1158.61" dur="5.67">different ways to fix it you can either</text>
  <text start="1160.4" dur="6.34">get rid of the word big that would read</text>
  <text start="1164.28" dur="3.72">twinkle twinkle star it doesn&amp;#39;t capture</text>
  <text start="1166.74" dur="3.6">the full meaning of what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1168" dur="5.43">intending some things to be in other</text>
  <text start="1170.34" dur="5.43">ways is to just add in the little word</text>
  <text start="1173.43" dur="5.04">so you have twinkle twinkle little star</text>
  <text start="1175.77" dur="4.68">and that still is quite confusing so</text>
  <text start="1178.47" dur="5.97">what you have to do is you have to go in</text>
  <text start="1180.45" dur="7.32">and replace big little and so one way to</text>
  <text start="1184.44" dur="6.36">do this you may give cats 9 RNA that</text>
  <text start="1187.77" dur="5.88">encodes twinkle twinkle big star and by</text>
  <text start="1190.8" dur="5.01">taking this search string a cassadine</text>
  <text start="1193.65" dur="4.71">koto can go into the genome and try to</text>
  <text start="1195.81" dur="5.43">find a place where the mutation matches</text>
  <text start="1198.36" dur="5.85">twinkle twinkle big star and then cast</text>
  <text start="1201.24" dur="6.03">on would make a cut in the word big and</text>
  <text start="1204.21" dur="5.85">then by providing the cell with a repair</text>
  <text start="1207.27" dur="7.05">template that carries a word little the</text>
  <text start="1210.06" dur="6.54">cell will repair this DNA break with the</text>
  <text start="1214.32" dur="4.11">news and repair sequence ok so there you</text>
  <text start="1216.6" dur="3.93">go and I am not gonna claim to be very</text>
  <text start="1218.43" dur="4.14">scientifically inclined but I started</text>
