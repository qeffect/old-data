  <text start="137.109" dur="3.901">talked about this and I gotta tell you</text>
  <text start="139" dur="2.73">I&amp;#39;m not really buying this I find this</text>
  <text start="141.01" dur="3.93">very interesting</text>
  <text start="141.73" dur="5.49">first of all this witness here says he</text>
  <text start="144.94" dur="4.859">just came out of nowhere and said that</text>
  <text start="147.22" dur="3.96">he she saw a man running well if you saw</text>
  <text start="149.799" dur="2.671">the video you could see that he wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="151.18" dur="3.69">running at all he was actually walking</text>
  <text start="152.47" dur="4.049">very casually now ladies and gentlemen</text>
  <text start="154.87" dur="4.11">um you know I&amp;#39;ve told you that I am in</text>
  <text start="156.519" dur="4.47">the entertainment industry I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="158.98" dur="3.81">this jail before this is exactly what it</text>
  <text start="160.989" dur="2.911">looks like I&amp;#39;m finding it hard to</text>
  <text start="162.79" dur="3.36">believe that this would have killed this</text>
  <text start="163.9" dur="4.38">man he wasn&amp;#39;t running at all I seemed</text>
  <text start="166.15" dur="3.809">very calm now I don&amp;#39;t know if this guy</text>
  <text start="168.28" dur="3.75">was drugged up if this guy is some sort</text>
  <text start="169.959" dur="4.771">of MKULTRA victim or not I&amp;#39;m not really</text>
  <text start="172.03" dur="4.049">sure about all that all what I am</text>
  <text start="174.73" dur="3.259">concerned about is what I can actually</text>
  <text start="176.079" dur="5.761">see was that it looks like whatever that</text>
  <text start="177.989" dur="5.411">gel he was using seemed to be the same</text>
  <text start="181.84" dur="4.11">kind of stuff that stuntmen used all the</text>
  <text start="183.4" dur="4.649">time and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s ha it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="185.95" dur="3.509">necessarily painful though so it seems</text>
  <text start="188.049" dur="2.761">really really sketchy and he was not</text>
  <text start="189.459" dur="4.321">running you saw the video I showed it to</text>
  <text start="190.81" dur="5.19">you the police came running and they put</text>
  <text start="193.78" dur="3.269">him out pretty quickly but he was not</text>
  <text start="196" dur="2.459">running as a matter of fact he seemed</text>
  <text start="197.049" dur="3.241">pretty calm now maybe he was calm</text>
  <text start="198.459" dur="3.301">because he was drugged up I won&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="200.29" dur="3.059">know that it looks like they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="201.76" dur="1.93">us to know this either because now this</text>
  <text start="203.349" dur="1.931">guy</text>
  <text start="203.69" dur="3.15">gone but of course it&amp;#39;s interesting also</text>
  <text start="205.28" dur="3.75">that looks like the family was looking</text>
  <text start="206.84" dur="4.74">for him which suggests to me that he was</text>
  <text start="209.03" dur="4.01">probably emotionally unstable right and</text>
  <text start="211.58" dur="4.11">then of course they refer to the</text>
  <text start="213.04" dur="4.45">incident last month where this man set</text>
  <text start="215.69" dur="4.65">himself on fire was so basically on a</text>
  <text start="217.49" dur="15.9">motorized wheelchair and I got a lot of</text>

  <text start="747.85" dur="3.359">supporters launched the nationalist</text>
  <text start="749.29" dur="3.87">campaign i&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s also a total</text>

  <text start="765.76" dur="5.04">against an amphibious assault just</text>
  <text start="768.49" dur="5.19">saying but they are spending a lot of</text>
  <text start="770.8" dur="5.04">money either way now because of this</text>
  <text start="773.68" dur="4.11">whole thing with the Rohingya they drove</text>
  <text start="775.84" dur="4.44">out hundreds of thousands of these guys</text>
  <text start="777.79" dur="4.86">they went back to Bangladesh and because</text>
  <text start="780.28" dur="5.13">of that the EU and the US put them on</text>
  <text start="782.65" dur="5.01">sanctions so the US will likely not be</text>
  <text start="785.41" dur="4.14">selling them any military equipment but</text>
  <text start="787.66" dur="4.17">I&amp;#39;m sure you could probably imagine who</text>
  <text start="789.55" dur="4.44">in the area would be more than happy to</text>
  <text start="791.83" dur="4.68">kick down with some military equipment</text>
  <text start="793.99" dur="4.92">one by the name China and two by the</text>
  <text start="796.51" dur="4.14">name of Russia so we&amp;#39;re not really sure</text>
  <text start="798.91" dur="3.48">how this is gonna shake out yet until</text>
  <text start="800.65" dur="3.57">they make their purchase or whatever but</text>
  <text start="802.39" dur="3.24">it looks like they&amp;#39;re definitely beefing</text>
  <text start="804.22" dur="3.18">up for something I also want to mention</text>
  <text start="805.63" dur="3.6">as a side note if you&amp;#39;ll remember just a</text>
  <text start="807.4" dur="3.84">couple days ago POTUS was in Japan</text>
  <text start="809.23" dur="4.68">meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe a</text>
  <text start="811.24" dur="5.25">regarding trade Korea China Russia who</text>
  <text start="813.91" dur="4.86">knows what right but meanwhile we had</text>
  <text start="816.49" dur="5.04">this stabbing horrific stabbing out in</text>
  <text start="818.77" dur="3.99">the city of Kawasaki now I&amp;#39;m hoping to</text>
  <text start="821.53" dur="3.09">bring you more I&amp;#39;m not really sure I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="822.76" dur="3.15">not gonna promise anything but I&amp;#39;m still</text>
  <text start="824.62" dur="2.82">looking into this story as this is a</text>
  <text start="825.91" dur="3.18">very very interesting story and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="827.44" dur="2.97">some interesting key details but the</text>
  <text start="829.09" dur="3.12">ones I want to share with you right now</text>
  <text start="830.41" dur="4.47">when that one of the victims was a</text>
  <text start="832.21" dur="4.41">specialist in Burmese yeah she was a</text>
  <text start="834.88" dur="3.63">foreign ministry official and her father</text>
  <text start="836.62" dur="4.29">was also as a matter of fact he was</text>
  <text start="838.51" dur="4.95">scheduled to become a Burmese diplomat</text>
  <text start="840.91" dur="4.47">so this is a horrific story and I found</text>
  <text start="843.46" dur="3.15">it very interesting I find it incredibly</text>
  <text start="845.38" dur="3.78">interesting that this small little</text>
  <text start="846.61" dur="4.14">country that generally doesn&amp;#39;t pop up in</text>
  <text start="849.16" dur="3.72">the news that often now of course this</text>
  <text start="850.75" dur="3.9">Rohingya situation has been going on for</text>

  <text start="854.65" dur="3.15">coming to a head right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="856.06" dur="3.12">spending a ton of money right now and</text>
  <text start="857.8" dur="2.85">the only reason that I was talking about</text>
