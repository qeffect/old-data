  <text start="71.94" dur="6.75">article from 2018 big dots did they</text>
  <text start="75.57" dur="4.439">connect steal and scribble revisited and</text>
  <text start="78.69" dur="3.3">I want to talk about this real quick</text>
  <text start="80.009" dur="3.961">just to make a quick connection just</text>
  <text start="81.99" dur="4.17">came across an intriguing theory about</text>
  <text start="83.97" dur="4.5">Sergey scrimp on the former Soviet</text>
  <text start="86.16" dur="4.17">Russian military intelligence agents who</text>
  <text start="88.47" dur="3.87">spied for Britain and along with his</text>

  <text start="109.83" dur="15.81">skripnikov our 21st interview on the job</text>
  <text start="123.869" dur="3.721">bachelors show this is an interview with</text>
  <text start="125.64" dur="4.38">gregory our copeley editor and publisher</text>
  <text start="127.59" dur="4.92">of defense and foreign affairs posited</text>
  <text start="130.02" dur="5.16">that sergei script</text>
  <text start="132.51" dur="3.78">in the steel dossier now we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="135.18" dur="2.7">cruise through some of this here i&amp;#39;m on</text>
  <text start="136.29" dur="3.33">the second paragraph copeley further</text>
  <text start="137.88" dur="4.02">explained or tried to explain to</text>
  <text start="139.62" dur="3.78">bachelor who kept cutting him off and</text>
  <text start="141.9" dur="3.12">that seems to be kind of a theme</text>
  <text start="143.4" dur="3.36">throughout this interview here the</text>
  <text start="145.02" dur="4.2">people who wish to see scruple become</text>
  <text start="146.76" dur="4.14">quiet were people in Washington the</text>
  <text start="149.22" dur="3.18">Democratic National Committee the</text>
  <text start="150.9" dur="3.6">Clinton campaign and people around</text>
  <text start="152.4" dur="4.23">Christopher Steele himself I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="154.5" dur="3.72">saying necessarily that mi6 or the</text>
  <text start="156.63" dur="3.36">British government had a writing winning</text>
  <text start="158.22" dur="3.27">hand in it but there are too many people</text>
  <text start="159.99" dur="4.2">who had an axe to grind to make sure</text>
  <text start="161.49" dur="4.44">that scribble did not did not what</text>
  <text start="164.19" dur="3.69">bachelor steps on the end of Copley&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="165.93" dur="3.75">sentence to interject a question about</text>
  <text start="167.88" dur="3.24">whether the Nova Chuck attack</text>
  <text start="169.68" dur="3.69">all the scribbles could have been a</text>
  <text start="171.12" dur="4.92">gangland hit and it seems that</text>
  <text start="173.37" dur="4.8">throughout this interview here that the</text>
  <text start="176.04" dur="4.11">interviewer is kind of trying to derail</text>
  <text start="178.17" dur="4.17">the conversation but there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="180.15" dur="4.55">interesting stuff in here Coakley had</text>
  <text start="182.34" dur="4.83">already explained that in scribbles UK</text>
  <text start="184.7" dur="4.81">retirement he did plenty of freelance</text>
  <text start="187.17" dur="4.86">work providing researchers for a price</text>
  <text start="189.51" dur="5.36">with that perfect shot of authentic but</text>
  <text start="192.03" dur="5.31">also custom-made quote unquote Russian</text>
  <text start="194.87" dur="4.36">intelligence in this course we are</text>
  <text start="197.34" dur="3.81">already starting to see we&amp;#39;ve known this</text>
  <text start="199.23" dur="3.839">for a long time but I should say coming</text>
  <text start="201.15" dur="4.5">out into the public narrative we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="203.069" dur="3.901">starting to see now that of course the</text>
  <text start="205.65" dur="3.869">information that was compiled in this</text>
  <text start="206.97" dur="4.71">dossier was all fake and of course James</text>
  <text start="209.519" dur="4.711">Comey signed off on it many people did</text>
  <text start="211.68" dur="4.02">they went ahead and used it anyway but</text>
  <text start="214.23" dur="3.3">this would be the guy that it originated</text>
  <text start="215.7" dur="3.959">from so Coakley says he would write</text>
  <text start="217.53" dur="4.049">whatever people wanted he would say what</text>
  <text start="219.659" dur="3.601">are you trying to achieve let me help</text>
  <text start="221.579" dur="4.891">you and he would do that and he was</text>
  <text start="223.26" dur="5.429">apparently prepared to if you like to</text>
  <text start="226.47" dur="4.439">fold under pressure and admit that he</text>
  <text start="228.689" dur="3.961">had done that and admit what he had</text>
  <text start="230.909" dur="3.901">written about Trump in that dossier was</text>
  <text start="232.65" dur="5.58">pure fiction written simply to provide</text>
  <text start="234.81" dur="5.88">his client with thought okay well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="238.23" dur="4.68">pretty telling right there right if this</text>
  <text start="240.69" dur="4.199">guy was going he was just gonna go ahead</text>
  <text start="242.91" dur="4.109">and drum up any kind of quote-unquote</text>
  <text start="244.889" dur="3.391">intelligence for anyone and of course</text>
  <text start="247.019" dur="2.791">there were people that were searching</text>
  <text start="248.28" dur="3.929">this out during the election times and</text>
  <text start="249.81" dur="4.319">really even before that right and yet</text>
  <text start="252.209" dur="4.861">this guy was not only willing to admit</text>
  <text start="254.129" dur="4.591">that he was the source he was admitting</text>
  <text start="257.07" dur="3.479">that he was gonna fake it and if you</text>
  <text start="258.72" dur="3.81">remember who was not willing to cop to</text>
  <text start="260.549" dur="4.171">this dossier was Christopher Steele</text>
  <text start="262.53" dur="4.71">himself so if Christopher Steele was</text>
  <text start="264.72" dur="3.6">playing ball buts cripple was not and it</text>
  <text start="267.24" dur="2.97">gets you know</text>
  <text start="268.32" dur="3.9">turns out that scribble was the source</text>
  <text start="270.21" dur="3.36">of this toss yeah well then that kind of</text>
  <text start="272.22" dur="3.53">changes things right and it kind of</text>
  <text start="273.57" dur="4.379">highlights this whole notha Chuck attack</text>
  <text start="275.75" dur="4.36">again because then it would really seem</text>
  <text start="277.949" dur="4.381">more like there would be some DC</text>
  <text start="280.11" dur="4.35">interest for this guy just shut his</text>
  <text start="282.33" dur="5.04">mouth considering their whole Russia</text>
  <text start="284.46" dur="4.17">narrative was based on this now the</text>
  <text start="287.37" dur="2.88">interview cuts him off again and</text>
  <text start="288.63" dur="3.42">Batchelor steps on Coakley again this</text>
  <text start="290.25" dur="3.57">time to put in a question about legality</text>
  <text start="292.05" dur="3.45">there&amp;#39;s nothing illegal about this</text>
  <text start="293.82" dur="3.659">correct Gregory Coakley says not</text>
  <text start="295.5" dur="3.659">necessarily until you get to the part</text>
  <text start="297.479" dur="3.361">where this was not just providing</text>
  <text start="299.159" dur="4.321">intelligence services to the Clinton</text>
  <text start="300.84" dur="5.16">campaign it was providing a</text>
  <text start="303.48" dur="5.73">for use in political warfare operations</text>
  <text start="306" dur="4.89">to influence an election of course</text>
  <text start="309.21" dur="3.57">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re pounding the drum</text>
  <text start="310.89" dur="4.35">over there on fox news right about now</text>
  <text start="312.78" dur="4.46">there he was basically fabricating</text>
  <text start="315.24" dur="4.08">material purporting it for it to be</text>
  <text start="317.24" dur="4.39">intelligence so now let me cruise you</text>
  <text start="319.32" dur="3.84">down here even so Copley&amp;#39;s assessment</text>
  <text start="321.63" dur="3.39">which he had said he had based on</text>
  <text start="323.16" dur="4.08">conversations we&amp;#39;ve had with people</text>
  <text start="325.02" dur="4.89">familiar with scribble came through loud</text>
  <text start="327.24" dur="5.73">and clear in scribbles pseudo country</text>
  <text start="329.91" dur="5.64">gentlemen retirement the ex GRU mi6</text>
  <text start="332.97" dur="4.62">double agent was selling custom-made</text>
  <text start="335.55" dur="3.93">Russian intelligence he had fabricated</text>
  <text start="337.59" dur="4.86">material that went into the steel</text>
  <text start="339.48" dur="4.59">dossier and he was prepared to say so</text>
  <text start="342.45" dur="4.44">and that&amp;#39;s the biggest deal right there</text>
  <text start="344.07" dur="4.65">he was prepared to say so by Copley&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="346.89" dur="4.14">logic this meant that scribbles enemies</text>
  <text start="348.72" dur="4.47">were also Trump&amp;#39;s enemies people in</text>
  <text start="351.03" dur="3.99">Washington the Democratic National</text>
  <text start="353.19" dur="3.9">Committee the Clinton campaign and</text>
  <text start="355.02" dur="3.75">people around Christopher Steele himself</text>
  <text start="357.09" dur="3.93">along with their mi6 and British</text>
  <text start="358.77" dur="4.11">government allies so while not much has</text>
  <text start="361.02" dur="4.68">been made about this know the chuck</text>
  <text start="362.88" dur="4.38">agent attack it seems that it might be</text>
  <text start="365.7" dur="3.39">bigger then it seems right maybe</text>
  <text start="367.26" dur="3.66">considering that if this guy really was</text>
  <text start="369.09" dur="3.93">the origin of all this information and</text>
  <text start="370.92" dur="4.8">he was perfectly happy to admit that it</text>
  <text start="373.02" dur="5.01">was bunk sounds likes cripples got no</text>
  <text start="375.72" dur="3.9">scruples now again from copeley bear in</text>
  <text start="378.03" dur="3.54">mind that large elements of the british</text>
  <text start="379.62" dur="3.36">intelligence community had assumed that</text>
  <text start="381.57" dur="4.05">hillary clinton was going to win the</text>
  <text start="382.98" dur="3.9">election they had assumed that it was</text>
  <text start="385.62" dur="3.6">safe to work with the obama</text>
  <text start="386.88" dur="6.18">administration during the eight years to</text>
  <text start="389.22" dur="5.58">help surveil u.s. nationals using GCHQ</text>
  <text start="393.06" dur="4.47">the british electronic surveillance</text>
  <text start="394.8" dur="5.49">agency to surveil US internal phone</text>
  <text start="397.53" dur="5.82">calls the NSA is not allowed to do it so</text>
  <text start="400.29" dur="5.04">they asked GCHQ to do it and q is</text>
  <text start="403.35" dur="5.58">explaining this process quite a bit a</text>
  <text start="405.33" dur="5.58">lot of this has to go really really even</text>
  <text start="408.93" dur="3.54">before FISA faisal was just sort of the</text>
  <text start="410.91" dur="4.41">cover-up with this but particularly when</text>
  <text start="412.47" dur="5.28">they refer to the 702 provision which</text>
  <text start="415.32" dur="5.7">talks about only really being able to</text>
  <text start="417.75" dur="7.2">surveil foreign nationals living outside</text>
  <text start="421.02" dur="5.46">the united states so we all know that</text>
  <text start="424.95" dur="4.59">they had the circumvent the fire by</text>
  <text start="426.48" dur="5.1">status of circumvent the NSA and this</text>
  <text start="429.54" dur="5.04">was how they did it and by drumming up</text>
  <text start="431.58" dur="4.53">basically various sources that were</text>
  <text start="434.58" dur="2.49">compiling into the crystal or steel</text>
  <text start="436.11" dur="3">dossier which will</text>
  <text start="437.07" dur="3.99">seems to turn out to be only one or two</text>
  <text start="439.11" dur="3.78">sources really just a bunch of bump</text>
  <text start="441.06" dur="3.27">right bachelor cuts it right right</text>
  <text start="442.89" dur="3.18">that&amp;#39;s standard that&amp;#39;s standard is it</text>
  <text start="444.33" dur="4.53">Gregory that was in place during the</text>
  <text start="446.07" dur="5.34">first Cold War Coakley says it was but</text>
  <text start="448.86" dur="4.35">it got a little fast and loose during</text>
  <text start="451.41" dur="4.11">the Obama administration where there was</text>
  <text start="453.21" dur="4.53">an increased level of surveillance of US</text>
  <text start="455.52" dur="4.29">citizens and telephone calls coming out</text>
  <text start="457.74" dur="4.2">of the u.s. bear in mind we&amp;#39;ve seen a</text>
  <text start="459.81" dur="3.63">lot of those reports being used against</text>
  <text start="461.94" dur="4.14">the Trump people by saying that their</text>
  <text start="463.44" dur="5.52">calls were surveilled and unintelligible</text>
  <text start="466.08" dur="5.13">without an ally evidence for the FBI yup</text>
  <text start="468.96" dur="4.02">enter interviewer so it sounds like the</text>
  <text start="471.21" dur="3.69">interviewer really wants to derail this</text>
  <text start="472.98" dur="5.97">interview and again keep in mind there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="474.9" dur="5.61">a package June 2018 since the spring the</text>
  <text start="478.95" dur="3.84">script poisoning has just sort of been</text>
  <text start="480.51" dur="4.86">sitting there like so much Putin mate</text>
  <text start="482.79" dur="4.5">without any discernible context amid</text>
  <text start="485.37" dur="4.71">many unanswered questions and few</text>
  <text start="487.29" dur="4.59">extremely non satisfactory answers</text>
  <text start="490.08" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s essentially what the Russian</text>
  <text start="491.88" dur="3.87">narrative is right a bunch of questions</text>
  <text start="493.98" dur="4.08">that they&amp;#39;ve posited but really no</text>
  <text start="495.75" dur="3.54">satisfactory answers after listening to</text>
  <text start="498.06" dur="2.52">the Coakley interview I began to</text>
  <text start="499.29" dur="3.06">understand part of the reason at least</text>
  <text start="500.58" dur="3.66">that there has been so little light shed</text>
  <text start="502.35" dur="3.51">on this gruesome incident yeah likely</text>
  <text start="504.24" dur="3">because it liked to downplay it they</text>
  <text start="505.86" dur="4.74">would have loved for this guy to just go</text>
  <text start="507.24" dur="5.4">away because if this guy really is the</text>
  <text start="510.6" dur="4.44">origin of all this and he comes up and</text>
  <text start="512.64" dur="4.8">freely says yeah I made it all up for a</text>
  <text start="515.04" dur="5.64">buck well that pretty much shuts it all</text>
  <text start="517.44" dur="6.18">down in a way that really no prosecution</text>
  <text start="520.68" dur="4.62">could or really any outside entity and</text>
  <text start="523.62" dur="2.25">really if it came from this guy he says</text>
  <text start="525.3" dur="2.13">it&amp;#39;s bunk</text>
  <text start="525.87" dur="3.9">Christopher Steele&amp;#39;s not copping to it</text>
  <text start="527.43" dur="4.29">the whole thing not only falls apart but</text>
  <text start="529.77" dur="4.02">more importantly is that people start to</text>
  <text start="531.72" dur="4.17">realize that this spying was going on</text>
  <text start="533.79" dur="4.32">with Democrats and Republicans it was</text>
  <text start="535.89" dur="6.06">pretty much all of Congress it was all</text>
  <text start="538.11" dur="5.67">you and I it was everybody right so this</text>
  <text start="541.95" dur="3.48">is far-reaching and when Democrats</text>
  <text start="543.78" dur="3.36">really understand how far-reaching this</text>
  <text start="545.43" dur="3.6">really what&amp;#39;s going on they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="547.14" dur="4.47">see that it covered the people that</text>
  <text start="549.03" dur="5.37">maybe they look up to as well</text>
  <text start="551.61" dur="4.41">maybe they won&amp;#39;t be able to care that</text>
  <text start="554.4" dur="3.21">much if they know that Trump was being</text>
  <text start="556.02" dur="3.63">spied on but if they realize that their</text>
  <text start="557.61" dur="4.35">favorite local senator or congressman or</text>
  <text start="559.65" dur="3.9">whatever was was also in the mix and</text>
  <text start="561.96" dur="3.42">that disaffected their side of the aisle</text>
  <text start="563.55" dur="3.74">then I think a lot more people will wake</text>
  <text start="565.38" dur="4.29">up and see what was really going on and</text>
  <text start="567.29" dur="4.18">sort of this alarm will</text>
  <text start="569.67" dur="3.57">hopefully go off but here&amp;#39;s my point</text>
  <text start="571.47" dur="3.24">after the poisoning it turns out that</text>
  <text start="573.24" dur="4.35">the British government issued two</text>
  <text start="574.71" dur="5.07">related D notices on the story</text>
  <text start="577.59" dur="3.96">a big fat chill on British press</text>
  <text start="579.78" dur="4.14">coverage what seems to have been an</text>
  <text start="581.55" dur="3.84">uppermost in the censorship requests was</text>
  <text start="583.92" dur="4.17">to ensure that the British press</text>
  <text start="585.39" dur="5.58">protected the mi6 connection to Sergei</text>
  <text start="588.09" dur="4.98">which is interesting all by itself such</text>
  <text start="590.97" dur="4.56">protection would seem to include the</text>
  <text start="593.07" dur="5.19">name of the retired mi6 agent who</text>
  <text start="595.53" dur="4.77">recruited scribble first discussed here</text>
  <text start="598.26" dur="4.68">as has been reported outside of Britain</text>
  <text start="600.3" dur="4.62">that retired mi6 agents name is Pablo</text>
  <text start="602.94" dur="3.72">Miller it has also been reported that</text>
  <text start="604.92" dur="5.28">Miller now works with another retired</text>
  <text start="606.66" dur="4.8">mi6 agent his name is Christopher Steele</text>

  <text start="1500.31" dur="3.66">you know my concern is that the deep</text>

  <text start="1518.85" dur="3.3">a lot of ground to cover beyond this too</text>
  <text start="1520.53" dur="3.06">okay so it doesn&amp;#39;t look good for it</text>
  <text start="1522.15" dur="3.42">McCabe at all and of course like I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1523.59" dur="3.87">been saying all along once we highlight</text>
  <text start="1525.57" dur="3.99">this story we&amp;#39;re gonna have to contrast</text>
  <text start="1527.46" dur="3.87">it with James Comey story and then of</text>
  <text start="1529.56" dur="4.05">course you have to look at aunt Loretta</text>
  <text start="1531.33" dur="4.17">Lynch&amp;#39;s story and of course rod Roe</text>
  <text start="1533.61" dur="4.41">story remember he was the one encouraged</text>
  <text start="1535.5" dur="4.35">to wear a wire inspire on the POTUS and</text>
  <text start="1538.02" dur="4.47">it seems like that might have gone even</text>
  <text start="1539.85" dur="5.13">deeper than we suspect and who knows</text>
  <text start="1542.49" dur="4.8">what else was being discussed but if you</text>
  <text start="1544.98" dur="5.13">want to point out that if you will</text>
  <text start="1547.29" dur="4.65">remember Michael Bromwich is the guy one</text>
  <text start="1550.11" dur="3.48">of the guys are representing McCabe and</text>
  <text start="1551.94" dur="4.35">of course if you don&amp;#39;t remember Michael</text>
  <text start="1553.59" dur="4.62">Bromwich this next picture will jog your</text>
  <text start="1556.29" dur="4.5">memory that&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="1558.21" dur="4.05">dunt and time that&amp;#39;s what it looks like</text>
  <text start="1560.79" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s actually happened in the picture</text>
  <text start="1562.26" dur="6.57">right lest we forget his last gig yeah</text>
  <text start="1565.05" dur="6.09">represented dr. Christine Blasi Ford and</text>
  <text start="1568.83" dur="4.65">remember we believe survivors right</text>
  <text start="1571.14" dur="4.83">except for this one yeah this was a</text>
  <text start="1573.48" dur="3.6">funky funky story and now it&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="1575.97" dur="3.51">out that this was really all about</text>
  <text start="1577.08" dur="4.71">putting out little asterisks next to</text>
  <text start="1579.48" dur="4.5">Cavanaugh&amp;#39;s name interestingly enough</text>
  <text start="1581.79" dur="3.3">this whole thing is coming back into</text>
  <text start="1583.98" dur="3.54">play right there</text>
  <text start="1585.09" dur="4.32">after Cavanaugh&amp;#39;s name again how about</text>
  <text start="1587.52" dur="4.32">that looks like Bromwich is doing</text>
  <text start="1589.41" dur="4.58">double-duty he&amp;#39;s coming back in the</text>
  <text start="1591.84" dur="5.07">movie to make some more trouble right</text>
  <text start="1593.99" dur="4.27">well this is likely to fall apart of</text>
  <text start="1596.91" dur="3.06">course because there&amp;#39;s not really much</text>
  <text start="1598.26" dur="4.05">to stand on but I do think there&amp;#39;s a few</text>
  <text start="1599.97" dur="4.98">different points that this is making me</text>
  <text start="1602.31" dur="4.59">think about first of all Kavanagh like I</text>
  <text start="1604.95" dur="3.18">just said putting the asterisks next to</text>
  <text start="1606.9" dur="3">Cavanaugh&amp;#39;s name is really really</text>
  <text start="1608.13" dur="3.42">important because they know at some</text>
  <text start="1609.9" dur="3.5">point who knows this could lead to I</text>
  <text start="1611.55" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t know if this will turn into the</text>
  <text start="1613.4" dur="4.09">Roe versus Wade situation further down</text>
  <text start="1616.41" dur="2.04">the line I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="1617.49" dur="3.48">that we&amp;#39;re probably not think about</text>
  <text start="1618.45" dur="4.71">right away but I suppose it could be a</text>
  <text start="1620.97" dur="6.57">possibility but let&amp;#39;s keep in mind too</text>
  <text start="1623.16" dur="7.56">that RBG Darth Vader her health has not</text>
  <text start="1627.54" dur="5.67">been going so well she&amp;#39;s got cank in the</text>
  <text start="1630.72" dur="3.87">pink she&amp;#39;s got the terminal cancer you</text>
  <text start="1633.21" dur="3.06">don&amp;#39;t recover from that even though they</text>
  <text start="1634.59" dur="4.08">say she&amp;#39;s recovered who knows what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1636.27" dur="5.25">going on with Ruth Bader right but we</text>
  <text start="1638.67" dur="5.01">know that she&amp;#39;s likely out the dough and</text>
  <text start="1641.52" dur="3.54">that probably means that we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1643.68" dur="4.16">have to start talking about the Supreme</text>
  <text start="1645.06" dur="5.49">Court again now keep in mind too that uh</text>
  <text start="1647.84" dur="4.36">Cavanaugh is a really antitrust and</text>
  <text start="1650.55" dur="3.12">that&amp;#39;s gonna break up a lot of things</text>
  <text start="1652.2" dur="3.29">too and I think that&amp;#39;s a bigger story</text>
  <text start="1653.67" dur="3.69">than we might be talking about</text>
  <text start="1655.49" dur="3.79">considering all these deep state</text>
  <text start="1657.36" dur="3.39">knuckleheads funnel a lot of their money</text>
  <text start="1659.28" dur="3.45">through these trusts and of course</text>
  <text start="1660.75" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re much harder to break up legally</text>
  <text start="1662.73" dur="4.2">and that&amp;#39;s why Kavanaugh would be so</text>
  <text start="1664.95" dur="4.44">important to them so there&amp;#39;s a few</text>
  <text start="1666.93" dur="4.11">different reasons on the face of this</text>
  <text start="1669.39" dur="3.21">all while they&amp;#39;re gonna go back for the</text>
  <text start="1671.04" dur="3.39">Cavanaugh thing and of course then flat</text>
  <text start="1672.6" dur="4.95">out really just a stall and distract is</text>
  <text start="1674.43" dur="4.41">always just a you know another result</text>
  <text start="1677.55" dur="3.6">that they would like to get out of this</text>
  <text start="1678.84" dur="5.43">but I wanted to point that out and of</text>
  <text start="1681.15" dur="4.65">course let&amp;#39;s not forget this notorious</text>
  <text start="1684.27" dur="4.29">pic right here and blow it up for you</text>
  <text start="1685.8" dur="5.34">yeah look at that right there that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1751.74" dur="6.66">into some sort of attack and of course</text>
  <text start="1754.5" dur="5.28">putting pressure on Saudi Arabia but you</text>
  <text start="1758.4" dur="2.82">know I don&amp;#39;t know I want to be honest</text>
  <text start="1759.78" dur="4.56">with you I would really like to wait</text>
  <text start="1761.22" dur="4.89">another 48 hours before truly commenting</text>
  <text start="1764.34" dur="5.28">on this I have a feeling that this is a</text>
  <text start="1766.11" dur="6.03">big big distraction now whether or not</text>
  <text start="1769.62" dur="4.74">we really know the culprit not sure if</text>
  <text start="1772.14" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s Iran not sure whether it really was</text>
  <text start="1774.36" dur="4.28">Houthi rebels in Yemen which is a true</text>
  <text start="1776.52" dur="4.92">or truly a terrible situation out there</text>
  <text start="1778.64" dur="5.409">you know we don&amp;#39;t really know but I find</text>
  <text start="1781.44" dur="5.52">the timing to be incredibly wonderful</text>
  <text start="1784.049" dur="4.771">just as we&amp;#39;re about to bring this IG</text>
  <text start="1786.96" dur="3.51">report to light and maybe finally see</text>
  <text start="1788.82" dur="4.109">some indictments but this so this</text>
  <text start="1790.47" dur="4.38">shouldn&amp;#39;t really be unexpected and like</text>
  <text start="1792.929" dur="3.571">I said maybe another 48 hours and I</text>
  <text start="1794.85" dur="3.69">think more things are going to shake out</text>
  <text start="1796.5" dur="4.77">in regards to this but it wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1798.54" dur="4.47">surprising to see Iran turn up the heat</text>
  <text start="1801.27" dur="4.01">around particularly at this time this is</text>
  <text start="1803.01" dur="5.1">remember we&amp;#39;re on essentially the</text>
  <text start="1805.28" dur="4.24">quintessential black site out there for</text>
  <text start="1808.11" dur="3.24">much of these deep state knuckleheads</text>

  <text start="1811.35" dur="3.78">course Iran is something they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1812.79" dur="4.98">to want to protect so like I said</text>
  <text start="1815.13" dur="4.14">remains to be seen I&amp;#39;m gonna wait 48</text>
