  <text start="79.95" dur="5.07">tonight durian remains stationary max</text>
  <text start="82.649" dur="4.351">winds are 140 miles an hour and most of</text>
  <text start="85.02" dur="4.5">the island remains within the Eyre wall</text>
  <text start="87" dur="5.399">radar loop runs 35 hours from 10 a.m.</text>
  <text start="89.52" dur="4.53">Sunday to 9 p.m. Monday as you can see</text>
  <text start="92.399" dur="5.191">it&amp;#39;s just looping right there it just</text>
  <text start="94.05" dur="5.67">kind of rolls itself in and of course</text>
  <text start="97.59" dur="3.9">obviously Southern Florida is bracing</text>

  <text start="115.07" dur="4.87">kind of kick it yes you can okay so</text>
  <text start="118.47" dur="3.39">there is a ton that we could talk about</text>
  <text start="119.94" dur="4.17">in regards to this storm and I want to</text>
  <text start="121.86" dur="4.319">point out first things first although it</text>
  <text start="124.11" dur="3.539">does seem rather sketchy that this thing</text>
  <text start="126.179" dur="3.81">is just kicking in the same place for</text>
  <text start="127.649" dur="3.36">about 36 hours and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="129.989" dur="3.391">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s gonna happen and then is</text>
  <text start="131.009" dur="3.631">gonna move northward now I know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="133.38" dur="3.06">gonna be a lot of weather experts out</text>
  <text start="134.64" dur="3.33">there and of course I am NOT one of them</text>
  <text start="136.44" dur="3.29">so I will of course defer to you I</text>
  <text start="137.97" dur="4.5">understand that that&amp;#39;s not necessarily</text>
  <text start="139.73" dur="4.33">abnormal I do know that storms can move</text>
  <text start="142.47" dur="3.57">and then they can just kind of settle in</text>
  <text start="144.06" dur="4.56">someplace so I do want to point out that</text>
  <text start="146.04" dur="4.32">I do understand that this can stay in</text>
  <text start="148.62" dur="4.25">one place for a while it&amp;#39;s happened</text>
  <text start="150.36" dur="5.28">before not completely abnormal but</text>
  <text start="152.87" dur="5.5">considering the really the political</text>

  <text start="1111.47" dur="4.41">is now is known as Castaway Cay in a</text>
  <text start="1113.48" dur="4.65">side note this has an interesting story</text>
  <text start="1115.88" dur="3.269">on its own now the Disney story I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1118.13" dur="2.279">exactly sure it has</text>

  <text start="1123.559" dur="4.92">actually goes back to the 60s you may</text>
  <text start="1126.169" dur="4.17">remember a guy named Frank barb barber</text>
  <text start="1128.479" dur="5.07">he actually ran things in ibaka too but</text>
  <text start="1130.339" dur="5.241">he ended up taking over for this Alvin</text>
  <text start="1133.549" dur="4.411">Tucker who bought it in the 60s and</text>
  <text start="1135.58" dur="4.509">ended up building an airstrip on there</text>
  <text start="1137.96" dur="4.409">and tons and tons of CIA planes were</text>
  <text start="1140.089" dur="3.81">going there flying cocaine and we know</text>
  <text start="1142.369" dur="3.93">this because he actually went to jail</text>
  <text start="1143.899" dur="4.2">for it and this was back in the day as a</text>
  <text start="1146.299" dur="4.5">matter of fact that airstrip is now like</text>
  <text start="1148.099" dur="5.16">this sort of big bike path for the</text>
  <text start="1150.799" dur="4.35">Disney for the Disney park there</text>
  <text start="1153.259" dur="3.24">I think it&amp;#39;s called serenity way but it</text>
  <text start="1155.149" dur="4.26">was originally an airstrip and they were</text>
  <text start="1156.499" dur="5.16">getting as much as six planes a day over</text>
  <text start="1159.409" dur="3.72">there tons and tons of cocaine and then</text>
  <text start="1161.659" dur="3">of course it was also rumored that if</text>
  <text start="1163.129" dur="3.061">you got on their bad side that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1164.659" dur="3.57">actually where they would leave you they</text>
  <text start="1166.19" dur="3.239">would leave you on that island now of</text>
  <text start="1168.229" dur="3.36">course that wouldn&amp;#39;t be the same kind of</text>
  <text start="1169.429" dur="3.69">thing now but back in the day that could</text>
  <text start="1171.589" dur="3.121">have killed you so this was a whole CIA</text>
  <text start="1173.119" dur="4.62">operation if you want to know more about</text>
  <text start="1174.71" dur="4.469">that once the DEA DEA found out they</text>
  <text start="1177.739" dur="2.87">started putting some plants there and</text>
  <text start="1179.179" dur="3.6">that was an operation called Operation</text>

  <text start="1187.219" dur="2.971">of communications and public affairs</text>

  <text start="1190.19" dur="3.929">Twitter Sunday night I understand your</text>
  <text start="1192.349" dur="3.69">concern as they are our co-workers</text>
  <text start="1194.119" dur="4.05">Castaway is south of the more</text>

  <text start="1214.489" dur="4.11">okay well that&amp;#39;s fair enough and I</text>
  <text start="1216.259" dur="4.47">understand that but this is really the</text>
  <text start="1218.599" dur="5.07">telling part here is the woman&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1220.729" dur="4.62">response why risk the lives of 97 staff</text>
  <text start="1223.669" dur="3.69">members they had plenty of time to</text>
  <text start="1225.349" dur="4.95">evacuate but the decision was made to</text>
  <text start="1227.359" dur="6.15">stay okay so I imagine it&amp;#39;s expensive to</text>
  <text start="1230.299" dur="5.01">evacuate them but 97 staff members seems</text>
  <text start="1233.509" dur="3.84">very very strange that they would all</text>
  <text start="1235.309" dur="4.651">leave them there right now keep in mind</text>
  <text start="1237.349" dur="4.02">this whole area has got little subs</text>
  <text start="1239.96" dur="3.329">we&amp;#39;ve talked about this before they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1241.369" dur="4.53">got little submarines that and they even</text>
  <text start="1243.289" dur="4.921">did little excursions to Epstein&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1245.899" dur="3.84">Island so we know that some suspect</text>
  <text start="1248.21" dur="3.419">stuff was going on there too</text>
  <text start="1249.739" dur="2.641">we can imagine being Disney there&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1251.629" dur="2.041">sorts</text>
  <text start="1252.38" dur="2.91">secret little chambers and stuff like</text>
  <text start="1253.67" dur="3.39">that this is something that we know from</text>
  <text start="1255.29" dur="4.32">Disney culture this isn&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="1257.06" dur="4.32">speculation but they left all these</text>
  <text start="1259.61" dur="4.38">people they had time to evacuate him and</text>
  <text start="1261.38" dur="4.14">didn&amp;#39;t Disney could not confirm Sunday</text>
  <text start="1263.99" dur="3.18">night how many workers were on the</text>
  <text start="1265.52" dur="3.87">island but according to Disney&amp;#39;s website</text>
  <text start="1267.17" dur="4.05">about 60 workers live there year-round</text>
  <text start="1269.39" dur="3.54">the company said it was in constant</text>
  <text start="1271.22" dur="3.6">communication via a satellite phone</text>
  <text start="1272.93" dur="3.51">every hour on the hour</text>

  <text start="1284.42" dur="4.95">of you who haven&amp;#39;t seen imaging here but</text>
  <text start="1286.85" dur="4.38">as you can see as you see the storm over</text>
  <text start="1289.37" dur="3.93">here by the islands but down on the tip</text>
  <text start="1291.23" dur="5.37">of southern Florida evidently this is a</text>
  <text start="1293.3" dur="5.01">pretty rather unusual anomaly right here</text>
  <text start="1296.6" dur="3.6">this whole strip of dark right here I</text>
  <text start="1298.31" dur="3.87">know if you could see my mouse but it</text>
  <text start="1300.2" dur="3.45">kind of seems to be feeding right into</text>
