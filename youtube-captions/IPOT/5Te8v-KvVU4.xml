  <text start="191.519" dur="5.491">affected the core protocol of PGP</text>

  <text start="232.29" dur="5.46">vulnerability in the open PGP system but</text>
  <text start="235.47" dur="4.889">rather in email programs that had been</text>

  <text start="240.359" dur="3.091">all right so this is really really</text>

  <text start="243.45" dur="5.489">interesting that this is called pretty</text>

  <text start="299.669" dur="4.351">doesn&amp;#39;t sound very good right you want</text>
  <text start="301.11" dur="5.13">very good privacy and when we think</text>
  <text start="304.02" dur="3.209">about very good privacy we think about</text>
  <text start="306.24" dur="3.269">something that I&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>

  <text start="696.06" dur="4.47">giving this a little nod that of course</text>
  <text start="698.73" dur="4.08">got me thinking about this tweet from</text>

  <text start="709.35" dur="2.93">strange</text>
  <text start="709.89" dur="5.1">and of course everyone was chanting big</text>
  <text start="712.28" dur="5.95">structural Bailey what an odd thing to</text>

  <text start="718.23" dur="3.18">right there and as you can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="720" dur="3.69">chanting this what a weird thing for</text>
  <text start="721.41" dur="4.8">everybody to chant right so this was all</text>
  <text start="723.69" dur="4.83">based off of her kind of her slogan big</text>

  <text start="728.52" dur="3.81">end up this whole Bailey thing with her</text>
  <text start="730.08" dur="4.35">dog was sort of to combat the whole mean</text>

  <text start="743.55" dur="3.45">we do know that dogs and very good boys</text>
