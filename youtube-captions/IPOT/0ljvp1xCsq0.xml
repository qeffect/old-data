  <text start="62.6" dur="6.69">this was supposed from july 2019 this</text>
  <text start="66.259" dur="5.581">was July 9th AG and Rogers meeting</text>
  <text start="69.29" dur="4.14">Rogers being Admiral Mike Rogers Durham</text>
  <text start="71.84" dur="4.5">and Rogers meetings</text>
  <text start="73.43" dur="4.86">why did Rogers retire why did Rogers</text>
  <text start="76.34" dur="4.529">visit POTUS at Trump Tower without</text>
  <text start="78.29" dur="3.18">authorization shortly after a skiff was</text>
  <text start="80.869" dur="3.961">installed</text>
  <text start="81.47" dur="6.06">why did select former ABC directors call</text>
  <text start="84.83" dur="4.47">for the removal of Rogers what a POTUS</text>
  <text start="87.53" dur="3.9">move his transition command center base</text>
  <text start="89.3" dur="5.55">of ops from Trump Tower the very next</text>
  <text start="91.43" dur="5.85">day well indeed Rogers has been meeting</text>
  <text start="94.85" dur="4.65">with Durham and we see over here this</text>
  <text start="97.28" dur="4.41">title from the intercept former NSA</text>
  <text start="99.5" dur="4.89">director is cooperating with probe of</text>
  <text start="101.69" dur="5.459">Trump Russia investigation indeed he is</text>
  <text start="104.39" dur="5.25">and he&amp;#39;s doing that voluntarily and this</text>
  <text start="107.149" dur="5.31">is all in regards to drumming up</text>
  <text start="109.64" dur="5.94">anything that would have originated in</text>
  <text start="112.459" dur="5.401">the Trump Russia investigation of course</text>
  <text start="115.58" dur="5.19">we ended up swinging that all to Ukraine</text>
  <text start="117.86" dur="4.83">but the original idea was that Trump was</text>
  <text start="120.77" dur="4.43">colluding with Russia right why did</text>
  <text start="122.69" dur="6">Rodgers retire well he retired in May of</text>
  <text start="125.2" dur="6.28">2018 and I want to point out that he</text>
  <text start="128.69" dur="5.61">joined a company to private intelligence</text>
  <text start="131.48" dur="5.58">firm their link to Israeli intelligence</text>
  <text start="134.3" dur="5.48">and it&amp;#39;s called Team 8 oddly enough</text>
  <text start="137.06" dur="6.78">teammate their logo looks a lot like</text>
  <text start="139.78" dur="6.85">8chan or a coon now right just saying</text>
  <text start="143.84" dur="8.13">but of course Admiral Mike Rogers the</text>
  <text start="146.63" dur="7.26">17th director of the NSA I know I wonder</text>
  <text start="151.97" dur="4.2">if it&amp;#39;s relevant</text>
  <text start="153.89" dur="4.02">why did Rogers visit POTUS at Trump</text>
  <text start="156.17" dur="4.08">Tower without authorization shortly</text>
  <text start="157.91" dur="4.74">after a skiff was installed well he knew</text>
  <text start="160.25" dur="4.23">all about fights abuse right and of</text>
  <text start="162.65" dur="2.91">course we&amp;#39;re gonna start seeing this</text>
  <text start="164.48" dur="3.21">play out now</text>
  <text start="165.56" dur="3.96">the FISA Court judge rosemary Collier</text>
  <text start="167.69" dur="3.69">ordering the release of pretty much</text>
  <text start="169.52" dur="4.74">anything that would have had to do with</text>
  <text start="171.38" dur="4.74">this Carter page faisal application</text>
  <text start="174.26" dur="3.54">rogers has a lot to do with that and he</text>
  <text start="176.12" dur="4.14">was essentially racing against the deep</text>
  <text start="177.8" dur="4.74">stay once he figured it out and of</text>
  <text start="180.26" dur="4.949">course they got on to him real quick and</text>
  <text start="182.54" dur="5.13">he became sort of persona non grata</text>
  <text start="185.209" dur="4.321">right anyway so he knew that this was</text>
  <text start="187.67" dur="4.59">going on and they had set up a skiff and</text>
  <text start="189.53" dur="4.489">Trump Towers and skiff being a sensitive</text>
  <text start="192.26" dur="4.02">compartmented information facility</text>
  <text start="194.019" dur="3.761">basically a really really quiet room</text>
  <text start="196.28" dur="4.14">where you can&amp;#39;t bring your phones right</text>
  <text start="197.78" dur="5.459">and he knew they were being bugged so he</text>
  <text start="200.42" dur="4.98">went there to warn POTUS the very next</text>
  <text start="203.239" dur="4.53">day the transition team packs up and</text>

  <text start="246.079" dur="3.481">you off with this here Rogers is no</text>
  <text start="247.64" dur="4.71">stranger to the controversy surrounding</text>
  <text start="249.56" dur="5.16">the 2016 election shortly after Trump</text>
  <text start="252.35" dur="3.99">warned the presidency Rogers traveled to</text>

  <text start="260.57" dur="4.95">Rogers informed Trump that the NSA knew</text>
  <text start="263.36" dur="3.929">that the Russians interfere in the</text>
  <text start="265.52" dur="3.51">election according to three people</text>
  <text start="267.289" dur="3.331">familiar with the briefing despite</text>
  <text start="269.03" dur="3.509">delivering what Rodgers told a</text>
  <text start="270.62" dur="4.41">confidante was bad news</text>
  <text start="272.539" dur="4.741">Trump would keep Rogers on as an NSA</text>
  <text start="275.03" dur="4.5">director while dismissing Brennan and</text>
  <text start="277.28" dur="4.53">clapper back to Baku post Q says</text>
  <text start="279.53" dur="6.09">something big is coming why I would say</text>
  <text start="281.81" dur="5.49">Admiral Mike Rogers is quite big right</text>
  <text start="285.62" dur="3.09">Admiral Mike Rogers knows where the</text>
  <text start="287.3" dur="3.48">bodies are buried he knows about the</text>
  <text start="288.71" dur="3.69">spying he knows about the wiretapping he</text>
  <text start="290.78" dur="3.27">just happens to work with a security</text>
  <text start="292.4" dur="3.57">company who just happens to have a logo</text>
  <text start="294.05" dur="3.69">very similar to a chant he knows all</text>
  <text start="295.97" dur="2.76">about a coon he knows all about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="297.74" dur="3.96">going on right</text>
  <text start="298.73" dur="5.88">I would say Admiral Mike Rogers knows</text>
  <text start="301.7" dur="4.92">what now we get a Twitter status - the</text>
  <text start="304.61" dur="3.87">POTUS he knows what&amp;#39;s up to the</text>
  <text start="306.62" dur="4.26">Democrats and crooked Hillary paid for</text>
  <text start="308.48" dur="4.08">and provided a fake dossier with phony</text>
  <text start="310.88" dur="3.81">information gotten from foreign sources</text>
  <text start="312.56" dur="4.59">pushed it to the corrupt media and dirty</text>
  <text start="314.69" dur="4.23">cops and have now been caught they spied</text>
  <text start="317.15" dur="4.89">on my campaign then tried to cover it up</text>
  <text start="318.92" dur="5.64">just like Watergate but bigger indeed I</text>
  <text start="322.04" dur="4.74">do want to point out - we have D C and H</text>
  <text start="324.56" dur="4.11">of course I would imagine since Hillary</text>
  <text start="326.78" dur="3.87">is a normal name we don&amp;#39;t usually use</text>
  <text start="328.67" dur="3.78">that capitalization right there but we</text>
  <text start="330.65" dur="4.86">have DC capitalized here and then we</text>
  <text start="332.45" dur="5.52">have dirty cops DC capitalized here as</text>
  <text start="335.51" dur="4.32">well as F D just pointed out for those</text>
  <text start="337.97" dur="3.33">he at home pay attention and while we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="339.83" dur="3.72">paying attention let&amp;#39;s pay attention to</text>
  <text start="341.3" dur="4.23">Eugene down here who&amp;#39;s a doctor and when</text>
  <text start="343.55" dur="4.29">he&amp;#39;s not busy saving lives and being a</text>
  <text start="345.53" dur="4.41">verified Twitter knucklehead he&amp;#39;s busy</text>
  <text start="347.84" dur="4.74">finding his way to the top of almost</text>
  <text start="349.94" dur="4.59">every single POTUS thread kind of like a</text>
  <text start="352.58" dur="3.72">couple of other knuckleheads named</text>
  <text start="354.53" dur="4.17">Crassus team that I remember from back</text>
  <text start="356.3" dur="4.86">in the day that was before they got</text>
  <text start="358.7" dur="4.38">caught and then booted permanently</text>
  <text start="361.16" dur="5.72">maybe Eugene&amp;#39;s one of those Facebook</text>
  <text start="363.08" dur="3.8">doctors remember those guys if I can get</text>
  <text start="367.18" dur="3.97">what he says do people really think this</text>
  <text start="369.41" dur="4.38">didn&amp;#39;t happen with no consequences</text>
  <text start="371.15" dur="6.03">fights a equals to start nobody is above</text>
  <text start="373.79" dur="4.98">the law not anymore in brackets indeed</text>
  <text start="377.18" dur="3.63">and Q is let us know that fire set</text>
  <text start="378.77" dur="3.87">equals to start once people understand</text>
  <text start="380.81" dur="3.96">what Pfizer was all about the whole</text>
  <text start="382.64" dur="3.33">narrative is really going to open up now</text>
  <text start="384.77" dur="3.24">I have a feeling there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="385.97" dur="3.81">more to it there I think Q is giving us</text>
  <text start="388.01" dur="3.57">more than we probably know at this point</text>
  <text start="389.78" dur="3.99">but we do know that that really is the</text>
  <text start="391.58" dur="4.71">starting point we already knew that</text>
  <text start="393.77" dur="4.23">spying was occurring before fire but</text>
  <text start="396.29" dur="2.97">FISA really seemed to be a turning point</text>
  <text start="398" dur="3.93">where they really were covering</text>
  <text start="399.26" dur="5.19">everything up right so I have a feeling</text>
  <text start="401.93" dur="4.77">there&amp;#39;s another meaning there but as</text>
  <text start="404.45" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;ve heard many many times Democrats</text>
  <text start="406.7" dur="5">always saying nobody is above the law</text>
  <text start="409.34" dur="6.18">how odd that they would use that term</text>
  <text start="411.7" dur="6.4">year of the boomerang 2019 let&amp;#39;s move on</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="5.16">oh it&amp;#39;s 37 41 22 minutes after the hour</text>
  <text start="418.1" dur="4.62">of 6:00 why are the two articles being</text>
  <text start="420.68" dur="4.32">the two articles of impeachment being</text>
  <text start="422.72" dur="5.19">held by Pelosi keep in mind those are</text>
  <text start="425" dur="4.98">abuse of power and obstruction we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="427.91" dur="3.85">holding actually impact the decision of</text>
  <text start="429.98" dur="4.12">the Senate what we already knew that</text>
  <text start="431.76" dur="5.04">Q knows that - saying no no it will not</text>
  <text start="434.1" dur="6.03">this will get swatted down in the Senate</text>
  <text start="436.8" dur="5.07">like Dikembe Mutombo that was probably a</text>
  <text start="440.13" dur="3.81">kind of a obscure reference right there</text>
  <text start="441.87" dur="4.98">well holding actually provide a better</text>
  <text start="443.94" dur="4.44">scenario public opinion to Democrats no</text>
  <text start="446.85" dur="3.27">because if Democrats really want to</text>
  <text start="448.38" dur="3.18">impeach him they&amp;#39;re going to sit there</text>
  <text start="450.12" dur="3">saying well why are you sitting on this</text>
  <text start="451.56" dur="2.79">let&amp;#39;s go ahead and move right I thought</text>
  <text start="453.12" dur="2.73">we were gonna do this they were all</text>
  <text start="454.35" dur="3.15">excited there were a lot of people that</text>
  <text start="455.85" dur="2.58">actually thought that POTUS wasn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="457.5" dur="3.63">POTUS anymore</text>
  <text start="458.43" dur="4.5">ya know so that&amp;#39;s not gonna help their</text>
  <text start="461.13" dur="3.8">narrative either so pushing it through</text>
  <text start="462.93" dur="4.65">doesn&amp;#39;t help sitting on it doesn&amp;#39;t help</text>
  <text start="464.93" dur="4.39">will holding actually sway select</text>
  <text start="467.58" dur="3.03">senators to change their vote well I</text>
  <text start="469.32" dur="3.33">think there are some people that would</text>
  <text start="470.61" dur="4.38">like to think that but the end of a day</text>
  <text start="472.65" dur="5.67">know when blackmail and threats no</text>
  <text start="474.99" dur="5.16">longer work but how do you legally</text>
  <text start="478.32" dur="4.02">inject evidence right why are the two</text>
  <text start="480.15" dur="3.72">articles being held by Pelosi well</text>
  <text start="482.34" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s a good question what happens when</text>
  <text start="483.87" dur="4.26">the articles of impeachment are sent</text>
  <text start="485.67" dur="4.05">from the house to the Senate while the</text>
  <text start="488.13" dur="3.42">Senate would probably block it like we</text>
  <text start="489.72" dur="4.17">just said can the Senate conduct other</text>
  <text start="491.55" dur="3.72">business during this time no and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="493.89" dur="3.45">really what this is about this is just</text>
  <text start="495.27" dur="4.02">about parading that accusation so that</text>
  <text start="497.34" dur="4.29">it looms over the President&amp;#39;s head all</text>
  <text start="499.29" dur="3.78">the way up to the election remember</text>
  <text start="501.63" dur="5.13">almost everything that&amp;#39;s being done</text>
  <text start="503.07" dur="4.71">right now on any side whether you want</text>
  <text start="506.76" dur="3.96">to call it white hat blacking out</text>
  <text start="507.78" dur="6">whatever all of its being done with</text>
  <text start="510.72" dur="4.92">20/20 in mind what value might exist by</text>
  <text start="513.78" dur="3.6">holding these articles how long do</text>
  <text start="515.64" dur="3.06">Senate impeachment trials normally take</text>
  <text start="517.38" dur="2.94">well I think we see what&amp;#39;s up right</text>
  <text start="518.7" dur="3.48">that&amp;#39;s gonna take us right up to the</text>
  <text start="520.32" dur="4.65">elections what statements have been made</text>
  <text start="522.18" dur="4.89">regarding timing think fast</text>
  <text start="524.97" dur="4.53">tracking what statements have been made</text>
  <text start="527.07" dur="5.28">by Chairman Graham regarding Senate FISA</text>
  <text start="529.5" dur="4.97">hearings and witnesses why is Pelosi</text>
  <text start="532.35" dur="4.62">holding the two articles of impeachment</text>
  <text start="534.47" dur="4.63">so I think we see here the Democrats are</text>
  <text start="536.97" dur="4.44">in a bit of a pickle if they sit on this</text>
  <text start="539.1" dur="4.29">impeachment then they frustrate their</text>
  <text start="541.41" dur="3.96">own base because their own base actually</text>
  <text start="543.39" dur="4.41">wants to move forward with impeachment</text>
  <text start="545.37" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re frustrated that this isn&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="547.8" dur="3.54">through and of course the Democrats</text>
  <text start="549.33" dur="3.42">haven&amp;#39;t educated their base that this</text>
  <text start="551.34" dur="3">could be the destruction of the</text>
  <text start="552.75" dur="3.99">Democratic Party if they actually push</text>
  <text start="554.34" dur="4.35">it forward because if it doesn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="556.74" dur="3.24">blocked by the Senate it will go to</text>
  <text start="558.69" dur="3.81">trial and of course that would be</text>
  <text start="559.98" dur="4.38">another mess - right so there must be</text>
  <text start="562.5" dur="3.06">another reason for sitting on all this</text>
  <text start="564.36" dur="3.39">other than just</text>
  <text start="565.56" dur="4.83">because the optics are benefiting POTUS</text>
  <text start="567.75" dur="3.81">and not the Democratic Party right so I</text>
  <text start="570.39" dur="3.12">think this is a really interesting</text>
  <text start="571.56" dur="3.69">thread from the last refuge who brings</text>
  <text start="573.51" dur="3.72">up a couple other interesting points as</text>
  <text start="575.25" dur="3.6">to why they may be sitting on this</text>
  <text start="577.23" dur="3.95">I don&amp;#39;t like gaming stuff out by</text>
  <text start="578.85" dur="5.85">thinking like this lawfare crew but</text>
  <text start="581.18" dur="6.28">there is a possibility this impeachment</text>
  <text start="584.7" dur="5.34">could be a disposable first step call it</text>
  <text start="587.46" dur="4.41">impeachment 1.0 they use this</text>
  <text start="590.04" dur="3.45">impeachment to get the judicial</text>
