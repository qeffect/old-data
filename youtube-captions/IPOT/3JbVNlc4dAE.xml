  <text start="90.77" dur="3.18">that we need to talk about because not</text>
  <text start="92.57" dur="3.689">only because of the importance of the</text>

  <text start="165.41" dur="3.15">point out if you&amp;#39;re not familiar with</text>
  <text start="166.37" dur="5.13">this story this is actually I covered</text>
  <text start="168.56" dur="4.89">this in the infinite Qian impossible</text>
  <text start="171.5" dur="3.57">foods video from the 5th you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="173.45" dur="3.93">actually see some of this video from</text>
  <text start="175.07" dur="5.1">daleiden &amp;amp; merritt and as well as some</text>
  <text start="177.38" dur="4.919">of their testimony their experience in</text>
  <text start="180.17" dur="3.899">this process so this is a weird weird</text>
  <text start="182.299" dur="4.141">thing because we have this going on with</text>
  <text start="184.069" dur="4.991">Lydon Merritt and we also have a similar</text>
  <text start="186.44" dur="6.129">situation with this James okay</text>
  <text start="189.06" dur="5.27">over there with project Veritas and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="192.569" dur="4.14">a similar thing to sort of undercover</text>
  <text start="194.33" dur="4.18">journalism and it&amp;#39;s a slippery slope</text>
  <text start="196.709" dur="3.841">because I&amp;#39;m not really sure when all the</text>
  <text start="198.51" dur="4.77">legalities are going to end up being</text>
  <text start="200.55" dur="5.04">considered in regards to this case this</text>
  <text start="203.28" dur="4.429">guy did go in there and give a fake</text>
  <text start="205.59" dur="5.46">identity and recorded this but what he</text>
  <text start="207.709" dur="5.021">uncovered was a much much bigger story</text>
  <text start="211.05" dur="3.42">and it&amp;#39;s not unlike O&amp;#39;Keefe although</text>
  <text start="212.73" dur="3.15">he&amp;#39;s dealing with a big tech and stuff</text>
  <text start="214.47" dur="4.32">like that but it&amp;#39;s the same kind of</text>
  <text start="215.88" dur="4.23">journalism so like I said slippery slope</text>
  <text start="218.79" dur="3.27">and I&amp;#39;d love to know what your guys</text>
  <text start="220.11" dur="4.98">thoughts on this but the point is is</text>
  <text start="222.06" dur="6.12">that both have uncovered really really</text>
  <text start="225.09" dur="5.31">big stories that are relevant and things</text>
  <text start="228.18" dur="4.05">that need to get uncovered so it remains</text>
  <text start="230.4" dur="4.71">to be seen what happens with the delight</text>
  <text start="232.23" dur="4.35">of Merritt but 15 felony charges if you</text>
  <text start="235.11" dur="3.39">want to know more about that see some of</text>
  <text start="236.58" dur="4.59">their video like I said go check out the</text>
  <text start="238.5" dur="4.56">infinite chant impossible foods by now</text>
  <text start="241.17" dur="3.539">we all know this much for many years</text>
  <text start="243.06" dur="3.6">abortion clinics including but not</text>
  <text start="244.709" dur="3.871">limited to Planned Parenthood have</text>
  <text start="246.66" dur="4.79">partnered with biotech companies to</text>
  <text start="248.58" dur="5.07">procure parts of fetuses after abortions</text>
  <text start="251.45" dur="4.87">biotech companies then obtain these</text>
  <text start="253.65" dur="5.01">fetuses for very little and sell them</text>
  <text start="256.32" dur="4.889">for astronomical prices a haze of</text>
  <text start="258.66" dur="4.259">palatability futurism heroic medicine</text>
  <text start="261.209" dur="3.481">and even morality hangover the whole</text>
  <text start="262.919" dur="4.921">thing as soon as we hear the word stem</text>
  <text start="264.69" dur="6.72">cell research indeed and I suppose there</text>
  <text start="267.84" dur="5.73">is merit to stem cell research in part</text>
  <text start="271.41" dur="5.61">but obviously obtaining it this way is</text>
  <text start="273.57" dur="5.34">very very creepy and what strikes me as</text>
  <text start="277.02" dur="4.44">really really odd here is that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="278.91" dur="3.96">picturing these biotech companies and</text>
  <text start="281.46" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;re seeing them get bigger and bigger</text>
  <text start="282.87" dur="4.26">and more and more involved well in order</text>
  <text start="285.12" dur="4.169">for them to do that they need to have</text>
  <text start="287.13" dur="4.009">something to work with so it shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="289.289" dur="4.591">be a surprise that they are wanting to</text>
  <text start="291.139" dur="4.631">procure these parts and once they get a</text>
  <text start="293.88" dur="4.92">you know addicted to that profit</text>
  <text start="295.77" dur="4.74">obviously we get some hazy kind of stuff</text>
  <text start="298.8" dur="3.81">here in how they&amp;#39;re obtaining these</text>
  <text start="300.51" dur="4.44">parts that&amp;#39;s really where it gets super</text>
  <text start="302.61" dur="4.08">super suspect these biotech companies</text>
  <text start="304.95" dur="3.24">are really really they need to have some</text>
  <text start="306.69" dur="4.71">sort of source to be able to work with</text>
  <text start="308.19" dur="4.979">right and we&amp;#39;ve seen this already to get</text>
  <text start="311.4" dur="3.57">a sense of the macabre eality in details</text>
  <text start="313.169" dur="3.301">one can download and read a Senate</text>
  <text start="314.97" dur="3.78">report titled human fetal tissue</text>
  <text start="316.47" dur="3.81">research context and controversy and of</text>
  <text start="318.75" dur="3.05">course this link will be down below for</text>
  <text start="320.28" dur="3.65">you so you can check out the report too</text>
  <text start="321.8" dur="5.489">page 3 spells out the grim business</text>
  <text start="323.93" dur="6.06">since 2010 three companies advance</text>
  <text start="327.289" dur="5.85">bioscience resources incorporated stem</text>
  <text start="329.99" dur="5.82">Xpress LLC and novo genex Laboratories</text>
  <text start="333.139" dur="5.28">LLC have paid Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="335.81" dur="4.68">affiliates to acquire aborted fetuses</text>
  <text start="338.419" dur="3.93">and subsequently sold the fetal tissue</text>
  <text start="340.49" dur="3.84">to their respective customers at</text>
  <text start="342.349" dur="4.711">substantially higher prices than their</text>
  <text start="344.33" dur="5.22">documented cost and we talked about stem</text>
  <text start="347.06" dur="4.8">express in my last video the one I was</text>
  <text start="349.55" dur="3.63">just talking about infinite Qian so go</text>

  <text start="353.18" dur="4.709">but we even shows you on the map their</text>
  <text start="355.28" dur="5.22">close proximity to Planned Parenthood as</text>
  <text start="357.889" dur="4.261">well as FedEx shipping centers the</text>
  <text start="360.5" dur="4.74">details are harrowing and heartbreaking</text>
  <text start="362.15" dur="5.759">on one day in June of 2014 the report</text>
  <text start="365.24" dur="4.56">states an ABR technician obtained a 20</text>
  <text start="367.909" dur="5.451">week old fetus at a Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="369.8" dur="7.169">clinic for which it paid the clinic $60</text>
  <text start="373.36" dur="7.029">from that one fetus ABR sold its brain</text>
  <text start="376.969" dur="7.651">to one customer for 325 dollars both of</text>
  <text start="380.389" dur="7.411">its eyes for $325 650 total to a second</text>
  <text start="384.62" dur="5.849">customer a portion of its liver to 304</text>

  <text start="390.469" dur="5.67">thymus for 325 in another portion of its</text>
  <text start="393.56" dur="5.82">liver for 325 to a fourth customer and</text>
  <text start="396.139" dur="5.101">it&amp;#39;s lung for 325 to a fifth customers</text>
  <text start="399.38" dur="3.99">you could see right there this was just</text>
  <text start="401.24" dur="5.489">one baby and we&amp;#39;ve been finding</text>
  <text start="403.37" dur="4.71">thousands and when these people are</text>
  <text start="406.729" dur="4.021">making this kind of price they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="408.08" dur="4.32">start getting addicted to that too and</text>
  <text start="410.75" dur="4.08">then morality kind of goes out the</text>
  <text start="412.4" dur="3.449">window you can see why this is such a</text>
  <text start="414.83" dur="3.989">huge problem</text>
  <text start="415.849" dur="4.141">ABR the report says procured the fetus</text>
  <text start="418.819" dur="3.75">at 9:00 a.m. in a Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="419.99" dur="5.28">clinic along with three others by 1:00</text>
  <text start="422.569" dur="4.291">p.m. in a four-hour window ABR owned six</text>
  <text start="425.27" dur="3.66">thousand eight hundred and twenty five</text>
  <text start="426.86" dur="4.5">dollars if you include service fees</text>
  <text start="428.93" dur="4.62">shipping disease tests and cleaning and</text>
  <text start="431.36" dur="5.429">freezing where applicable the ABR</text>
  <text start="433.55" dur="5.609">technician paid a mere fifteen dollars</text>
  <text start="436.789" dur="4.111">an hour earn 60 dollars during this time</text>
  <text start="439.159" dur="3.271">Planned Parenthood&amp;#39;s defender in the</text>
  <text start="440.9" dur="3.21">legacy media have pointed out that</text>
  <text start="442.43" dur="3.87">Planned Parenthood only charged the</text>
  <text start="444.11" dur="4.29">biotech companies modest fees to cover</text>
  <text start="446.3" dur="4.14">the cost of procurement about $50 per</text>
  <text start="448.4" dur="4.109">specimen but apparently the companies</text>
  <text start="450.44" dur="3.93">themselves do all the procuring with</text>
  <text start="452.509" dur="3.111">their own technicians on site which</text>
  <text start="454.37" dur="4.79">means Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="455.62" dur="4.65">does in fact profit now I&amp;#39;m gonna try</text>
  <text start="459.16" dur="2.7">and cruise you through some of the</text>
  <text start="460.27" dur="2.79">gruesome stuff is at least as much as I</text>
  <text start="461.86" dur="3.66">can today because I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="463.06" dur="3.78">the politics a little bit but the next</text>
  <text start="465.52" dur="3.33">couple paragraphs go on to talk about</text>
  <text start="466.84" dur="4.079">daleiden merit how they got involved in</text>
  <text start="468.85" dur="2.67">it how they went undercover and this and</text>
  <text start="470.919" dur="2.371">that</text>
  <text start="471.52" dur="3.63">but let&amp;#39;s get to the politics of it here</text>
  <text start="473.29" dur="2.99">inside of the smear Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="475.15" dur="5.4">for its part</text>
  <text start="476.28" dur="6.28">unbelievably hired fusion GPS to</text>
  <text start="480.55" dur="3.929">discredit daleiden and merit of course</text>
  <text start="482.56" dur="4.65">if you don&amp;#39;t know who fusion GPS that is</text>
  <text start="484.479" dur="4.891">the same group that was paid to compile</text>
  <text start="487.21" dur="6.57">the Christopher Christopher steel</text>
  <text start="489.37" dur="8.22">dossier for the D and see how bow dad</text>
  <text start="493.78" dur="5.82">their 2017 report claims to have</text>
  <text start="497.59" dur="4.17">forensic evidence the videos were edited</text>
  <text start="499.6" dur="4.26">to create a false narrative and even</text>
  <text start="501.76" dur="3.33">contained audio manipulation okay well</text>
  <text start="503.86" dur="2.64">if you&amp;#39;ve seen the video and I&amp;#39;ve shown</text>
  <text start="505.09" dur="3.15">you some of that video you&amp;#39;ll see that</text>
  <text start="506.5" dur="3.389">that&amp;#39;s really really hard to do because</text>
  <text start="508.24" dur="2.67">a lot of these employees were speaking</text>
  <text start="509.889" dur="3.571">it was coming right out of their own</text>
  <text start="510.91" dur="3.33">mouth this claim has been proven untrue</text>
  <text start="513.46" dur="2.19">daleiden</text>
  <text start="514.24" dur="3.51">testified that prior to going undercover</text>
  <text start="515.65" dur="4.35">he consulted with lawyers to make sure</text>
  <text start="517.75" dur="4.229">he could legally record conversations he</text>
  <text start="520" dur="5.19">learned he could under california penal</text>
  <text start="521.979" dur="4.681">codes 632 and 633 point five okay well</text>
  <text start="525.19" dur="2.79">i&amp;#39;m and i&amp;#39;m look into that myself</text>
  <text start="526.66" dur="2.67">because like i said in the beginning in</text>
  <text start="527.98" dur="3.15">the video i was not aware of these</text>
  <text start="529.33" dur="3.81">legalities here but it seems like the</text>
  <text start="531.13" dur="4.26">lighting was already aware of this one</text>
  <text start="533.14" dur="5.25">stem express witness testified that she</text>
  <text start="535.39" dur="8.37">sold a single vial of stem cells from an</text>
  <text start="538.39" dur="7.29">aborted baby for $17,000 in 2012 the</text>
  <text start="543.76" dur="3.66">scientific director for stem express</text>
  <text start="545.68" dur="4.17">made public remarks at a conference</text>
  <text start="547.42" dur="4.919">revealing that stem express went from a</text>
  <text start="549.85" dur="4.859">fifteen thousand dollar loan company to</text>
  <text start="552.339" dur="4.981">a multi-million dollar company in just</text>
  <text start="554.709" dur="5.25">two years and like i was just saying you</text>
  <text start="557.32" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t grow that much without having some</text>
  <text start="559.959" dur="4.681">sort of product and of course that</text>
  <text start="561.82" dur="4.8">demand is going to get more and more so</text>
  <text start="564.64" dur="3.51">that&amp;#39;s going to lead to more and more</text>
  <text start="566.62" dur="4.23">things like we had with this story</text>
  <text start="568.15" dur="6.18">yesterday from this guy in indiana was</text>
  <text start="570.85" dur="4.92">found with 2,200 fetuses or maybe parts</text>
  <text start="574.33" dur="4.56">they said really but essentially it was</text>
  <text start="575.77" dur="4.89">bodies it was President Obama&amp;#39;s DOJ that</text>
