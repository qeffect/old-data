  <text start="123.32" dur="4.85">they don&amp;#39;t want anything out of the</text>

  <text start="128.17" dur="6.129">it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that things are okay it</text>

  <text start="139.7" dur="5.28">protection team running over time</text>
  <text start="141.91" dur="4.69">keeping the market steady but when we</text>
  <text start="144.98" dur="3.539">look at consumer confidence right now</text>
  <text start="146.6" dur="3.27">and it&amp;#39;s showing up in the conference</text>
  <text start="148.519" dur="3.391">board and we know the conference board</text>
  <text start="149.87" dur="3.39">is controlled by the government they</text>
  <text start="151.91" dur="6.2">give them grand they give them money and</text>
  <text start="153.26" dur="8.61">they fund them now the conference board</text>
  <text start="158.11" dur="6.879">Bloomberg and you Mitch well they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="161.87" dur="6.3">in agreement the consumer confidence</text>
  <text start="164.989" dur="6.991">index for all of these they are</text>
  <text start="168.17" dur="6.149">declining right now and we can see that</text>
  <text start="171.98" dur="7.62">the consumer confidence index decline</text>
  <text start="174.319" dur="9.121">year-on-year from 10 4.1 2 98</text>
  <text start="179.6" dur="6.45">point-six because people are becoming</text>
  <text start="183.44" dur="4.74">aware that there&amp;#39;s something wrong in</text>
  <text start="186.05" dur="4.44">the economy something is going on it</text>
  <text start="188.18" dur="3.87">makes no sense there are corporations</text>
  <text start="190.49" dur="5.01">that are laying off and continually</text>
  <text start="192.05" dur="5.55">laying off and these individuals are</text>
  <text start="195.5" dur="3.6">having a very difficult time trying to</text>
  <text start="197.6" dur="5.22">find work we know that Twitter right now</text>
  <text start="199.1" dur="5.94">is laying off about eight percent of its</text>
  <text start="202.82" dur="4.89">workforce that&amp;#39;s about 300 people they</text>
  <text start="205.04" dur="5.67">did this a year ago and we can see right</text>
  <text start="207.71" dur="6.36">now that the situation is deteriorating</text>
  <text start="210.71" dur="6.87">very very quickly now when we look at</text>
  <text start="214.07" dur="5.25">credit cards most people survive on</text>
  <text start="217.58" dur="3.45">credit cards they use them to pay their</text>
  <text start="219.32" dur="3.63">bills they use them to go shopping</text>
  <text start="221.03" dur="4.71">because they don&amp;#39;t have cash on hand</text>
  <text start="222.95" dur="5.55">they don&amp;#39;t make enough out in the world</text>
  <text start="225.74" dur="5.64">to have the cash now this is not just a</text>
  <text start="228.5" dur="6.03">few select people there are many people</text>
  <text start="231.38" dur="5.67">out there that are surviving on credit</text>
  <text start="234.53" dur="5.49">because the amount that they&amp;#39;re bringing</text>
  <text start="237.05" dur="5.1">in is just not enough to support them</text>
  <text start="240.02" dur="4.41">and this is coming out of the wall</text>
  <text start="242.15" dur="4.89">street journal and it points out that</text>
  <text start="244.43" dur="5.49">delinquency rates of subprime credit</text>
  <text start="247.04" dur="6.27">well they have surged to the highest</text>
  <text start="249.92" dur="5.85">levels since 2012 because what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="253.31" dur="4.77">happening is as people lose their jobs</text>
  <text start="255.77" dur="4.11">are getting maybe a part time or two</text>
  <text start="258.08" dur="5.73">part-time jobs maybe they can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="259.88" dur="5.73">find a job and what happens is you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="263.81" dur="5.31">make the payments on your credit cards</text>
  <text start="265.61" dur="5.82">it becomes very very difficult and we</text>
  <text start="269.12" dur="4.59">also have to remember the credit cards</text>
  <text start="271.43" dur="4.74">have been sending out applications to</text>
  <text start="273.71" dur="4.8">these subprime borrowers because they</text>
  <text start="276.17" dur="4.44">need to spread debt that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="278.51" dur="3.84">central banking system is all about and</text>
  <text start="280.61" dur="4.14">we see right now things are starting to</text>
  <text start="282.35" dur="4.56">backfire on continually spreading dead</text>
  <text start="284.75" dur="3.69">out into the world debt onto the people</text>
  <text start="286.91" dur="5.36">because the people just don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="288.44" dur="6.15">funds to come up with paying these high</text>
  <text start="292.27" dur="5.62">payments on credit cards and some of</text>
  <text start="294.59" dur="5.64">them are nineteen percent twenty percent</text>
  <text start="297.89" dur="6.27">some are all the way the some are as</text>
  <text start="300.23" dur="7.83">high as thirty percent and we can see</text>
  <text start="304.16" dur="6.78">right now is that the volume of subprime</text>
  <text start="308.06" dur="5.46">card issuance is up twenty percent</text>
  <text start="310.94" dur="6.39">year-over-year in 2015 and</text>
  <text start="313.52" dur="8.19">it is up fifty-six percent compared to</text>
  <text start="317.33" dur="8.22">2013 and we can see right now that the</text>
  <text start="321.71" dur="7.829">situation in credit card delinquencies</text>
  <text start="325.55" dur="7.26">auto loan delinquencies well they&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="329.539" dur="6.361">the rise now case-shiller came out with</text>
  <text start="332.81" dur="4.289">their home price index and they are</text>
  <text start="335.9" dur="3.03">reporting because we have to remember</text>
  <text start="337.099" dur="3.841">they look at 20 different cities and</text>
  <text start="338.93" dur="4.79">it&amp;#39;s much easier for the central bank to</text>
  <text start="340.94" dur="5.34">manipulate the prices in these cities</text>
  <text start="343.72" dur="4.599">now the rest of the country they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="346.28" dur="3.93">care about because no one hears about</text>
  <text start="348.319" dur="3.391">what&amp;#39;s happening in other places but</text>
  <text start="350.21" dur="2.88">when you look around you can see that</text>
  <text start="351.71" dur="4.38">people have their houses on the market</text>
  <text start="353.09" dur="5.4">and they&amp;#39;re continually dropping their</text>
  <text start="356.09" dur="4.44">prices they can&amp;#39;t sell them but in these</text>
  <text start="358.49" dur="5.78">20 cities they have the ability to</text>
  <text start="360.53" dur="7.05">manipulate the market in that area</text>
  <text start="364.27" dur="5.709">because the banks are are able to keep</text>
  <text start="367.58" dur="4.739">homes off the market they have hedge</text>
  <text start="369.979" dur="6.24">funds investment companies come in they</text>
  <text start="372.319" dur="5.791">purchase tracks and tracks of homes they</text>
  <text start="376.219" dur="5.25">rent them if they can but they keep them</text>
  <text start="378.11" dur="7.83">off the market and this allows home</text>
  <text start="381.469" dur="7.44">prices to move up and right now what</text>
  <text start="385.94" dur="6.569">they&amp;#39;re saying is that the home prices</text>
  <text start="388.909" dur="6.32">have recovered all their losses and our</text>
  <text start="392.509" dur="8.371">back at the highest level since June of</text>
  <text start="395.229" dur="9.581">2006 all 20 cities so home prices rise</text>
  <text start="400.88" dur="8.46">year over a year so we are back in the</text>
  <text start="404.81" dur="8.579">same exact spot that we were in 2006</text>
  <text start="409.34" dur="7.759">which means this bubble is going to pop</text>
  <text start="413.389" dur="5.84">and it is going to be a disaster and</text>
  <text start="417.099" dur="5.981">when we look at the housing industry</text>
  <text start="419.229" dur="6.671">what do we see well the US housing</text>
  <text start="423.08" dur="6.809">market is ballooned to 26 trillion</text>
  <text start="425.9" dur="6">dollars in many markets prices exceed</text>
  <text start="429.889" dur="4.71">even the peak or the prior bubble that</text>
  <text start="431.9" dur="6.06">blew up so spectacularly back in two</text>
  <text start="434.599" dur="5.761">thousand eight and we can see that this</text>
  <text start="437.96" dur="4.769">whole thing is weighed down by 14</text>
  <text start="440.36" dur="5.55">trillion in mortgage debt or about</text>
  <text start="442.729" dur="5.611">seventy six percent of u.s. gdp of that</text>
  <text start="445.91" dur="5.04">10 trillion is owed on one to four</text>
  <text start="448.34" dur="6.69">family residence residence the numbers</text>
  <text start="450.95" dur="8.88">are big and they matter but the question</text>
  <text start="455.03" dur="7.98">is who is lending is it the banks well</text>
  <text start="459.83" dur="6.3">no it&amp;#39;s non banks they&amp;#39;re called shadow</text>
  <text start="463.01" dur="8.66">banks they have now overtaken commercial</text>
  <text start="466.13" dur="9.87">banks to grab a slice of mortgages and</text>
  <text start="471.67" dur="6.49">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re taking a</text>
  <text start="476" dur="6.99">slice of e-government guaranteed</text>
  <text start="478.16" dur="7.71">mortgages they are giving these</text>
  <text start="482.99" dur="4.95">mortgages to subprime people anyone they</text>
  <text start="485.87" dur="6.75">possibly can just like they did prior to</text>
  <text start="487.94" dur="10.05">2008 once they do this they sell them</text>
  <text start="492.62" dur="8.22">off and we can see right now this is a</text>
  <text start="497.99" dur="6.63">problem and we&amp;#39;re heading down the same</text>
  <text start="500.84" dur="7.8">exact path that we did back in two</text>
  <text start="504.62" dur="7.11">thousand eight now we can see that there</text>
  <text start="508.64" dur="8.52">are a lot of non banks these are the</text>
  <text start="511.73" dur="10.68">shadow banks and they have been writing</text>
  <text start="517.16" dur="8.27">loans like crazy non baked Quicken Loans</text>
  <text start="522.41" dur="5.46">they have about 18,000 origination</text>
  <text start="525.43" dur="6.07">caliber home loans they have about</text>
  <text start="527.87" dur="6.05">13,000 originations then we have bank of</text>
  <text start="531.5" dur="6.27">america fairway independent mortgage</text>
  <text start="533.92" dur="6.67">JPMorgan Chase movement mortgage prime</text>
  <text start="537.77" dur="5.73">lending guaranteed rate and guild</text>
  <text start="540.59" dur="4.98">mortgage of these top 10 originator</text>
  <text start="543.5" dur="6.47">&amp;#39;he&amp;#39;s shadow banks originated</text>
  <text start="545.57" dur="8.7">sixty-three percent of the mortgages and</text>
  <text start="549.97" dur="6.96">we can see they&amp;#39;re going as strong as</text>
  <text start="554.27" dur="5.88">they possibly can into the mortgage</text>
  <text start="556.93" dur="7.98">arena and they&amp;#39;re going after the</text>
  <text start="560.15" dur="8.61">riskier borrowers and these are the</text>
  <text start="564.91" dur="7.3">government guaranteed no down payment or</text>
  <text start="568.76" dur="5.7">low down payment mortgages and then</text>
  <text start="572.21" dur="6.06">again they wrap them up they sell them</text>
  <text start="574.46" dur="4.679">off this is going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="578.27" dur="4.319">design</text>
  <text start="579.139" dur="8.01">stir in the real estate market this is a</text>
  <text start="582.589" dur="7.56">repeat of what happened in 2006-2007</text>
  <text start="587.149" dur="5.22">leading up to 2008-2009 where everything</text>
  <text start="590.149" dur="4.98">completely fell apart and we can see</text>
  <text start="592.369" dur="8.88">we&amp;#39;re headed in that direction once</text>
  <text start="595.129" dur="10.5">again and this time there&amp;#39;s no hope no</text>
  <text start="601.249" dur="8.28">one&amp;#39;s gonna bail out these banks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="605.629" dur="8.31">gonna bail in because the losses are</text>
  <text start="609.529" dur="8.16">going to be huge and prices are going to</text>
  <text start="613.939" dur="5.94">drop like you&amp;#39;ve never seen before the</text>
  <text start="617.689" dur="4.62">housing market is going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="619.879" dur="3.781">disaster actually caterpillars out there</text>
  <text start="622.309" dur="3.03">and we talked about caterpillar</text>
  <text start="623.66" dur="4.289">yesterday and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="625.339" dur="6.571">there&amp;#39;s economic weakness throughout</text>
  <text start="627.949" dur="5.88">much of the world and they don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="631.91" dur="4.349">anything improving anytime soon well</text>
  <text start="633.829" dur="4.41">after 49 months or so they haven&amp;#39;t seen</text>
  <text start="636.259" dur="3.33">any improvements and we can see right</text>
  <text start="638.239" dur="4.26">now things are definitely getting worse</text>
  <text start="639.589" dur="4.41">the Baltic Dry Index it is dropped to</text>
  <text start="642.499" dur="3.601">eight hundred and thirteen points it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="643.999" dur="5.55">down another 18 points and it looks like</text>
  <text start="646.1" dur="9.029">it&amp;#39;s dropping pretty fast here and we</text>
  <text start="649.549" dur="7.77">see Wells Fargo where they mislead the</text>
  <text start="655.129" dur="5.01">public they opened up many many accounts</text>
  <text start="657.319" dur="4.71">and people are looking at this and</text>
  <text start="660.139" dur="5.6">saying you know something I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="662.029" dur="6.48">to bank with wells fargo right now and</text>
  <text start="665.739" dur="5.47">fourteen percent of those that were</text>
  <text start="668.509" dur="4.971">polled who were Wells Fargo customers</text>
  <text start="671.209" dur="4.74">they decided to leave the bank they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="673.48" dur="5.829">closing their accounts taking their</text>
  <text start="675.949" dur="6.3">currency and going someplace else and we</text>
  <text start="679.309" dur="6.87">can see right now that the banking</text>
  <text start="682.249" dur="7.58">system is completely insolvent we</text>
  <text start="686.179" dur="6.03">understand that the stress test is a</text>
  <text start="689.829" dur="4.271">propaganda piece where they use it to</text>
  <text start="692.209" dur="5.521">convince everyone that everything is</text>
  <text start="694.1" dur="5.789">fine and we know it is not and the</text>
  <text start="697.73" dur="5.759">government&amp;#39;s will no longer bail out</text>
  <text start="699.889" dur="9.481">these banks so we have the economic</text>
  <text start="703.489" dur="8.031">system completely contracting</text>
  <text start="709.37" dur="6.02">at a rate that we&amp;#39;ve never seen before</text>
  <text start="711.52" dur="7.66">even worse than two thousand eight and</text>
  <text start="715.39" dur="7.09">when things start to speed up its going</text>
  <text start="719.18" dur="6.75">to be a complete disaster and things are</text>
  <text start="722.48" dur="6.57">going to hit the bottom very very hard</text>
  <text start="725.93" dur="5.73">and the only thing that the central</text>
  <text start="729.05" dur="5.82">banks will be able to do is print more</text>
  <text start="731.66" dur="6.179">currency or electronic electronically</text>
  <text start="734.87" dur="5.73">create the currency and what will that</text>
  <text start="737.839" dur="4.471">help will that create jobs no they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="740.6" dur="5.429">just going to do that to prop up the</text>
  <text start="742.31" dur="8.46">banks and to prop up the corporations</text>
  <text start="746.029" dur="8.041">they&amp;#39;re going to need the ability to</text>
  <text start="750.77" dur="5.79">purchase stocks so it looks like we are</text>
  <text start="754.07" dur="3.99">headed towards this phase one of the</text>
  <text start="756.56" dur="5.19">collapse which we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
