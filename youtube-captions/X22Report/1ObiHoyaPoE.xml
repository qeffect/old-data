  <text start="80.75" dur="4.02">economy is doing well and everything is</text>
  <text start="82.549" dur="4.591">fine there&amp;#39;s no reason for an emergency</text>

  <text start="88.67" dur="4.4">the company before or you had some type</text>
  <text start="91.31" dur="4.229">of family emergency you call a meeting</text>

  <text start="95.539" dur="4.951">an emergency if there&amp;#39;s a problem and we</text>
  <text start="98.78" dur="4.199">see right now that there was a meeting</text>
  <text start="100.49" dur="5.78">between Yellen the president the vice</text>
  <text start="102.979" dur="7.68">president finance ministers bankers and</text>
  <text start="106.27" dur="6.279">as we can see the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="110.659" dur="3.901">is continually telling us that you know</text>
  <text start="112.549" dur="4.831">his administration is very transparent</text>
  <text start="114.56" dur="4.71">the Fed is very transparent it&amp;#39;s working</text>
  <text start="117.38" dur="5.61">for the people everything is for the</text>
  <text start="119.27" dur="8.099">people and there was one person that</text>
  <text start="122.99" dur="7.049">asked the federal reserve by writing in</text>
  <text start="127.369" dur="4.741">for some information about what happened</text>
  <text start="130.039" dur="6.961">in the meeting and under the freedom of</text>
  <text start="132.11" dur="7.38">information act 5 USC 552 and they were</text>
  <text start="137" dur="4.41">asking for the minutes of what happened</text>
  <text start="139.49" dur="3.15">in the meeting now of course as we know</text>
  <text start="141.41" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re never going to give up the</text>
  <text start="142.64" dur="6.39">minutes of what happened in this meeting</text>
  <text start="144.62" dur="6.78">because the Fed the president the</text>
  <text start="149.03" dur="4.5">administration they&amp;#39;re not working for</text>
  <text start="151.4" dur="5.25">the people but very interestingly a</text>
  <text start="153.53" dur="5.73">letter came back and the letter stated</text>
  <text start="156.65" dur="6.149">that the staff searched the board</text>
  <text start="159.26" dur="5.509">records and made suitable inquiries but</text>
  <text start="162.799" dur="5.791">did not find any</text>
  <text start="164.769" dur="7.241">responsive to the request and cannot</text>
  <text start="168.59" dur="6.539">provide any information on what happened</text>
  <text start="172.01" dur="5.339">in the meeting so when you hear this and</text>
  <text start="175.129" dur="6.511">you look at this and you realize what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="177.349" dur="7.801">going on you realize that the Fed the</text>
  <text start="181.64" dur="6.299">Obama administration they are not</text>
  <text start="185.15" dur="5.489">accountable to the public what so ever</text>
  <text start="187.939" dur="6.5">and you can see where their loyalties</text>
  <text start="190.639" dur="7.97">lie it is not for the people but for</text>
  <text start="194.439" dur="10.541">themselves corporations foreign entities</text>
  <text start="198.609" dur="8.38">etc etc now out in Germany Obama is out</text>
  <text start="204.98" dur="4.02">there trying to push the TTIP trying to</text>
  <text start="206.989" dur="5.461">convince the people out there how great</text>
  <text start="209" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s going to be for them and thousands</text>
  <text start="212.45" dur="3.989">upon thousands of protesters have come</text>
  <text start="214.25" dur="4.379">out onto the streets of Hanover to say</text>
  <text start="216.439" dur="6.871">absolutely not we do not want this TT</text>
  <text start="218.629" dur="6.48">TTIP us-eu trade deal and many Germans</text>
  <text start="223.31" dur="4.62">feel it will reduce consumer protection</text>
  <text start="225.109" dur="4.47">and under mine workers protection people</text>
  <text start="227.93" dur="3.36">say that the deal is going to compromise</text>
  <text start="229.579" dur="4.8">the European Union sovereignty and</text>
  <text start="231.29" dur="5.729">create much more secrecy with one of the</text>
  <text start="234.379" dur="4.801">biggest concerns being that the</text>
  <text start="237.019" dur="4.201">agreement is wrapped up in a big veil of</text>
  <text start="239.18" dur="5.459">secrecy that people are not happy with</text>
  <text start="241.22" dur="5.28">and that&amp;#39;s exactly right this whole</text>
  <text start="244.639" dur="6.141">thing&amp;#39;s been a secret because it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="246.5" dur="8.489">for the people it is for corporations</text>
  <text start="250.78" dur="5.859">the central bank and it is definitely</text>
  <text start="254.989" dur="4.68">not for the people actually the German</text>
  <text start="256.639" dur="5.1">economy minister is saying if the US</text>
  <text start="259.669" dur="4.381">continues to insist on the transatlantic</text>
  <text start="261.739" dur="5.101">trade investment partnership and its</text>
  <text start="264.05" dur="6.089">current form it may ruin the entire free</text>
  <text start="266.84" dur="5.43">trade deal and he went on to say that</text>
  <text start="270.139" dur="4.831">the Americans want to hold fast to their</text>
  <text start="272.27" dur="4.56">by American idea we can&amp;#39;t accept that</text>
  <text start="274.97" dur="4.319">they don&amp;#39;t want to open their public</text>
  <text start="276.83" dur="4.2">tenders to European companies he said</text>
  <text start="279.289" dur="3.391">for me that goes against free trade if</text>
  <text start="281.03" dur="3.84">the Americans hold fast to this position</text>
  <text start="282.68" dur="6.18">we don&amp;#39;t need the free trade treaty and</text>
  <text start="284.87" dur="6.15">TTP I will fail now i&amp;#39;m just going to</text>
  <text start="288.86" dur="3.84">substitute the word by american because</text>
  <text start="291.02" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;s not what it&amp;#39;s really about it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="292.7" dur="5.67">about corporations taking control it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="295.76" dur="4.59">about central banks taking control</text>
  <text start="298.37" dur="3.78">and taken the sovereign area away from</text>
  <text start="300.35" dur="2.97">each and every one of the countries and</text>
  <text start="302.15" dur="3.93">even the sovereignty of the United</text>
  <text start="303.32" dur="5.22">States and actually this entire deal at</text>
  <text start="306.08" dur="5.43">TPP doesn&amp;#39;t work for the United States</text>
  <text start="308.54" dur="4.47">either it doesn&amp;#39;t help the people it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="311.51" dur="3.51">not going to bring in more jobs actually</text>
  <text start="313.01" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s going to take a lot of jobs away</text>
  <text start="315.02" dur="4.679">from Americans just like NAFTA and all</text>
  <text start="317.57" dur="5.04">the other trade agreements which we</text>
  <text start="319.699" dur="7.081">reported on previously now out in Kiev</text>
  <text start="322.61" dur="9.08">we hear some information that the Kiev</text>
  <text start="326.78" dur="8.669">government they are testing a tactical</text>
  <text start="331.69" dur="5.86">ballistic missile now the tactical</text>
  <text start="335.449" dur="4.171">ballistic missile can be used in</text>
  <text start="337.55" dur="4.08">battlefield with a range of about 300</text>
  <text start="339.62" dur="6.21">kilometers and the missiles that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="341.63" dur="7.259">testing can carry nuclear biological and</text>
  <text start="345.83" dur="4.41">chemical payloads and this is something</text>
  <text start="348.889" dur="3.631">that we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch very</text>
  <text start="350.24" dur="5.37">very carefully because as we realize as</text>
  <text start="352.52" dur="6.899">tensions heat up in this area they might</text>
  <text start="355.61" dur="6.24">resort to using this type of weapon now</text>
  <text start="359.419" dur="5.671">on the other hand there are other saying</text>
  <text start="361.85" dur="4.89">that this is fake phony and false and</text>
  <text start="365.09" dur="5.22">what they&amp;#39;re really testing doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="366.74" dur="4.89">whatsoever but I think what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="370.31" dur="3.18">doing is they&amp;#39;re putting this out there</text>
  <text start="371.63" dur="3.24">to let everyone know that something</text>
  <text start="373.49" dur="3.72">might occur and they might have snuck</text>
  <text start="374.87" dur="4.74">something into the country in the hell</text>
  <text start="377.21" dur="5.22">you know with the CIA with the US</text>
  <text start="379.61" dur="5.67">government other agencies helping to get</text>
  <text start="382.43" dur="4.709">this in there to make it seem like that</text>
  <text start="385.28" dur="3.66">they created it on their own because</text>
  <text start="387.139" dur="4.411">when the offensive starts they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="388.94" dur="4.74">able to use this type of weapon now</text>
  <text start="391.55" dur="5.28">things are really heating up with NATO</text>
  <text start="393.68" dur="5.91">and Russia NATO now wants to have a</text>
  <text start="396.83" dur="3.93">naval presence in the Black Sea but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="399.59" dur="3.15">not going to be very simple because we</text>
  <text start="400.76" dur="5.879">have to remember the Montreux convention</text>
  <text start="402.74" dur="7.32">of 1936 strictly regulates the entry of</text>
  <text start="406.639" dur="6.181">warships into the Black Sea also it</text>
  <text start="410.06" dur="5.97">restricts the size it also restricts</text>
  <text start="412.82" dur="6">what ships can enter the sea and each</text>
  <text start="416.03" dur="5.069">ship only has about 21 days in the Black</text>
  <text start="418.82" dur="4.26">Sea then they have to leave unless you</text>
  <text start="421.099" dur="4.5">are one of those countries that have a</text>
  <text start="423.08" dur="4.709">presence on the Black Sea then you can</text>
  <text start="425.599" dur="4.261">have your ships there and that means</text>
  <text start="427.789" dur="4.171">that turkey is going to have to do the</text>
  <text start="429.86" dur="3.869">heavy lifting in this area a</text>
  <text start="431.96" dur="4.35">along with Ukraine along with Bulgaria</text>
  <text start="433.729" dur="4.111">along with Romania and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="436.31" dur="3.24">have to watch this situation very very</text>
  <text start="437.84" dur="4.669">carefully because we see that what</text>
  <text start="439.55" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re trying to do is surround Russia</text>
  <text start="442.509" dur="4.271">completely and we see they&amp;#39;re placing</text>
  <text start="444.47" dur="4.47">all military assets all around to make</text>
  <text start="446.78" dur="3.359">sure that they encircled Russia just</text>
  <text start="448.94" dur="6.65">like they&amp;#39;re doing to china in the</text>
  <text start="450.139" dur="8.911">Pacific now we see that North Korea</text>
  <text start="455.59" dur="5.859">allegedly launched a ballistic missile</text>
  <text start="459.05" dur="5.089">from a submarine and of course the u.s.</text>
  <text start="461.449" dur="7.22">is out there saying okay this is it</text>
  <text start="464.139" dur="9.641">they&amp;#39;ve just done this and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="468.669" dur="6.641">hit the red line and North Korea they</text>
  <text start="473.78" dur="4.05">have approached the United States many</text>
  <text start="475.31" dur="4.65">many times saying listen we will stop</text>
  <text start="477.83" dur="4.709">these missile tests and most of them</text>
  <text start="479.96" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t even work and others we don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="482.539" dur="3.571">have proof that they actually did it</text>
  <text start="484.43" dur="3.87">like the earthquake that happened in</text>
  <text start="486.11" dur="4.2">North Korea there&amp;#39;s no radiation Japan</text>
  <text start="488.3" dur="3.42">even reported they&amp;#39;re seeing absolutely</text>
  <text start="490.31" dur="3.27">no evidence that it was any type of</text>
  <text start="491.72" dur="3.09">nuclear weapon and I think there was</text>
  <text start="493.58" dur="4.14">just an earthquake and they use that</text>
  <text start="494.81" dur="5.55">propaganda with no proof behind it just</text>
  <text start="497.72" dur="5.129">to push the war agenda and what I mean</text>
  <text start="500.36" dur="4.38">by that is it allowed them because as</text>
  <text start="502.849" dur="3.871">soon as it happened they increased the</text>
  <text start="504.74" dur="3.959">military budget South Korea increased a</text>
  <text start="506.72" dur="4.02">military budget they made they start</text>
  <text start="508.699" dur="4.26">making deals bringing in the sad missile</text>
  <text start="510.74" dur="4.799">system they made deals are bringing in</text>
  <text start="512.959" dur="4.801">more military assets they started to</text>
  <text start="515.539" dur="5.13">have drills in the south because of all</text>
  <text start="517.76" dur="5.579">this the speakers went up in the zone</text>
  <text start="520.669" dur="4.711">between the two countries and we see</text>
  <text start="523.339" dur="3.961">that the u.s. is using this to</text>
  <text start="525.38" dur="3.75">continually provoke North Korea now</text>
  <text start="527.3" dur="5.07">North Korea has come out and said listen</text>
  <text start="529.13" dur="6.57">if you stop the drills and you calm</text>
  <text start="532.37" dur="5.159">everything down we will stop using our</text>
  <text start="535.7" dur="5.1">nuclear weapons and we would like to</text>
  <text start="537.529" dur="5.641">have peace negotiations with the US but</text>
  <text start="540.8" dur="4.59">the US has not responded whatsoever to</text>
  <text start="543.17" dur="4.979">that and you can see they&amp;#39;re ramping up</text>
  <text start="545.39" dur="4.35">the provocations towards North Korea now</text>
  <text start="548.149" dur="4.021">the United States is taking it a step</text>
  <text start="549.74" dur="3.9">further the United States now is</text>
  <text start="552.17" dur="5.97">restricting the travel of North Korean</text>
  <text start="553.64" dur="7.889">foreign minister to the UN the foreign</text>
  <text start="558.14" dur="6.15">minister will only be allowed to work</text>
  <text start="561.529" dur="4.321">within the UN and do the functions</text>
  <text start="564.29" dur="5.219">within</text>
  <text start="565.85" dur="8.729">this small little area because of their</text>
  <text start="569.509" dur="8.281">latest missile testing and all of this</text>
  <text start="574.579" dur="6.75">is showing us that the United States is</text>
  <text start="577.79" dur="6.359">continually provoking each one of these</text>
  <text start="581.329" dur="5.88">countries China North Korea Russia Iran</text>
  <text start="584.149" dur="5.011">Syria because they&amp;#39;re really trying very</text>
  <text start="587.209" dur="4.38">very hard at this point to try to get</text>
  <text start="589.16" dur="5.52">this war started now we realize that</text>
  <text start="591.589" dur="4.791">china is saying hey listen we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="594.68" dur="4.649">to have anything to do with North Korea</text>
  <text start="596.38" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;re placing and we agree with the</text>
  <text start="599.329" dur="4.56">United States and placing sanctions on</text>
  <text start="601.24" dur="4.24">North Korea so you can see we&amp;#39;re on your</text>
  <text start="603.889" dur="4.081">side but the United States doesn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="605.48" dur="3.779">this because they know that if they can</text>
  <text start="607.97" dur="3.78">get into North Korean they can start the</text>
  <text start="609.259" dur="4.801">war they want it to lead to China so</text>
  <text start="611.75" dur="4.05">China right now they&amp;#39;re bringing some</text>
  <text start="614.06" dur="3.509">troops up to the border of North Korea</text>
  <text start="615.8" dur="3.149">because they realize that eventually</text>
  <text start="617.569" dur="2.911">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is if they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="618.949" dur="3.031">get the war started with China they</text>
  <text start="620.48" dur="2.789">can&amp;#39;t get it with Russia they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="621.98" dur="3">to go with North Korea because they know</text>
  <text start="623.269" dur="5.041">North Korea they have the ability to</text>
  <text start="624.98" dur="4.83">provoke and they are pretty sure they</text>
  <text start="628.31" dur="3.899">can get them to do something and if they</text>
  <text start="629.81" dur="4.98">don&amp;#39;t do something they can show the</text>
  <text start="632.209" dur="4.261">world that yeah with a false flag they</text>
  <text start="634.79" dur="4.049">did something and we need to go in there</text>
  <text start="636.47" dur="4.65">and China realizes this and there are</text>

  <text start="641.12" dur="4.05">soldiers up to the border of North Korea</text>
  <text start="643.04" dur="3.419">because they realize what the United</text>
  <text start="645.17" dur="3.21">States is doing at this point just like</text>
  <text start="646.459" dur="3.771">Russia realizes it and this is why they</text>
  <text start="648.38" dur="4.8">continually try to tamp everything down</text>
  <text start="650.23" dur="5.799">because they know right now that the</text>
  <text start="653.18" dur="5.759">u.s. is continually pushing the idea of</text>
  <text start="656.029" dur="6.091">war in all these areas now Obama is out</text>
  <text start="658.939" dur="5.241">there and he can assure us that that</text>
  <text start="662.12" dur="6.659">there&amp;#39;s going to be no ground troops in</text>
  <text start="664.18" dur="6.339">Syria to remove Assad he said it would</text>
  <text start="668.779" dur="4.351">be a mistake for the United States or</text>
  <text start="670.519" dur="6.69">Great Britain to send ground troops and</text>
  <text start="673.13" dur="8.399">other military assets into Syria to</text>
  <text start="677.209" dur="6.06">remove Assad he&amp;#39;s saying that the</text>
  <text start="681.529" dur="5.191">international community needs to come</text>
  <text start="683.269" dur="6">together to talk about how we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="686.72" dur="7.91">to have this transitional government and</text>
  <text start="689.269" dur="7.981">how Assad is going to step down well</text>
  <text start="694.63" dur="4.36">Syria they&amp;#39;ve already discussed this</text>
  <text start="697.25" dur="3.899">it&amp;#39;s going to be left up to the people</text>
  <text start="698.99" dur="6.539">and if you really listen to what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="701.149" dur="7.44">saying he&amp;#39;s threatening the entire</text>
  <text start="705.529" dur="5.161">process by saying that Assad must step</text>
  <text start="708.589" dur="3.75">down out he said this in Geneva 1 they</text>
  <text start="710.69" dur="4.44">said it in Geneva 2 here we are in</text>
  <text start="712.339" dur="5.071">Geneva 3 nothing has changed so if you</text>
  <text start="715.13" dur="4.59">really listen to Obama he says he can</text>
  <text start="717.41" dur="4.14">assure the American people in the world</text>
  <text start="719.72" dur="3.48">that the United States Great Britain and</text>
  <text start="721.55" dur="4.849">the coalition forces they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="723.2" dur="6.329">bringing in troops but as we reported</text>
  <text start="726.399" dur="5.44">the United States Great Britain the</text>
  <text start="729.529" dur="6.091">coalition forces they&amp;#39;ve been bringing</text>
  <text start="731.839" dur="6.271">in troops and positioning them right</text>
  <text start="735.62" dur="6.26">outside of Syria a lot of the troops are</text>
  <text start="738.11" dur="6.63">in Iraq there are some troops in Syria</text>
  <text start="741.88" dur="3.94">remember when he&amp;#39;s assured us that the</text>
  <text start="744.74" dur="3.06">troops will be coming home from</text>
  <text start="745.82" dur="3.42">Afghanistan well it looks like the</text>
  <text start="747.8" dur="3.42">opposite is happening remember LeAnn</text>
  <text start="749.24" dur="6.12">assured us that there&amp;#39;ll be no ground</text>
  <text start="751.22" dur="6.96">troops in Iraq well now we have 3800</text>
  <text start="755.36" dur="6.18">plus permanent soldiers and we also have</text>
  <text start="758.18" dur="5.58">those temporary soldiers which is about</text>
  <text start="761.54" dur="5.13">four thousand or so and of course</text>
  <text start="763.76" dur="4.23">there&amp;#39;s no expiration date on how long</text>
  <text start="766.67" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re going to be in there so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="767.99" dur="5.25">really permanent soldiers so if you add</text>
  <text start="770.45" dur="5.579">up the numbers we&amp;#39;re almost up to 8,000</text>
  <text start="773.24" dur="6.2">soldiers or so where he said there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="776.029" dur="6.451">going to be no ground troops in Iraq and</text>
  <text start="779.44" dur="5.139">we also have ground troops and see</text>
  <text start="782.48" dur="6.24">remember those special op teams well</text>
  <text start="784.579" dur="8.461">guess what they&amp;#39;re in Syria so we do</text>
  <text start="788.72" dur="7.05">have troops in all of these areas so so</text>
  <text start="793.04" dur="5.88">far all I see is lies coming from him</text>
  <text start="795.77" dur="4.92">and this tells us that he&amp;#39;s going to do</text>
  <text start="798.92" dur="4.05">the actual opposite because we know that</text>
  <text start="800.69" dur="3.66">Ashton Carter has been visiting all the</text>
  <text start="802.97" dur="3.59">coalition forces telling them they need</text>
  <text start="804.35" dur="4.799">more soldiers more to military assets</text>
  <text start="806.56" dur="6.13">into this area and this is what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="809.149" dur="6.361">been doing and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="812.69" dur="4.41">the u.s. is also building bases in Syria</text>
  <text start="815.51" dur="3.509">which are complete now where they can</text>
  <text start="817.1" dur="4.7">bring in c-130 transport planes and</text>
  <text start="819.019" dur="7.891">other military assets into the area and</text>
  <text start="821.8" dur="5.68">Obama right now is really threatening</text>
  <text start="826.91" dur="2.429">saying</text>
  <text start="827.48" dur="5.669">if we don&amp;#39;t come up with this type of</text>
  <text start="829.339" dur="6.36">plan by having a sod step down all we</text>
  <text start="833.149" dur="6.18">have left is force and we see already</text>
  <text start="835.699" dur="5.491">the talks are collapsing now turkey is</text>
  <text start="839.329" dur="3.63">out there saying that and this is coming</text>
  <text start="841.19" dur="4.49">from the Turkish Prime Minister they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="842.959" dur="5.701">going to take all necessary measures to</text>
  <text start="845.68" dur="4.99">stop the missiles coming in from Syria</text>
  <text start="848.66" dur="3.78">into Turkey of course they&amp;#39;re saying the</text>
  <text start="850.67" dur="3.33">Islamic state is firing the missiles but</text>
  <text start="852.44" dur="3.72">what we can see right now is they are</text>
  <text start="854" dur="5.55">building up and preparing to go into</text>
  <text start="856.16" dur="5.85">Syria along with the u.s. along with</text>
  <text start="859.55" dur="4.729">Great Britain along with the coalition</text>
  <text start="862.01" dur="4.23">forces and we see at this point that</text>
  <text start="864.279" dur="4.36">Denmark and many other countries have</text>
  <text start="866.24" dur="5.459">already brought in military assets more</text>
  <text start="868.639" dur="6.57">soldiers and are contributing to the</text>
  <text start="871.699" dur="7.311">next great offensive and if plans and</text>
  <text start="875.209" dur="6.06">the talks all start breaking down</text>
  <text start="879.01" dur="4.93">they&amp;#39;re going in this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="881.269" dur="6.18">prepared for all of this and every time</text>
  <text start="883.94" dur="5.519">the US government comes out and tells</text>
  <text start="887.449" dur="4.231">you they&amp;#39;re not doing it they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="889.459" dur="5.551">doing it they&amp;#39;re not doing it well guess</text>
  <text start="891.68" dur="6.75">what they&amp;#39;re about to do it now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="895.01" dur="6.569">getting reports that the Obama</text>
  <text start="898.43" dur="6.659">administration will likely soon release</text>
  <text start="901.579" dur="6.331">the 28-page secret chapter about the</text>
  <text start="905.089" dur="5.19">Saudis being involved in 911 now we know</text>
  <text start="907.91" dur="3.9">Obama went to Saudi Arabia to have talks</text>
  <text start="910.279" dur="4.531">we know that Saudi Arabia is moving away</text>
  <text start="911.81" dur="5.06">from the petro dollar and it seems that</text>
  <text start="914.81" dur="4.74">maybe those talks didn&amp;#39;t go that well</text>
  <text start="916.87" dur="3.55">and it looks like Saudi Arabia is saying</text>
  <text start="919.55" dur="2.099">you know something we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="920.42" dur="3.96">continually move away we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="921.649" dur="5.13">sell a lot of the assets and it looks</text>
  <text start="924.38" dur="6.29">like the US government right now is</text>
  <text start="926.779" dur="7.92">continually threatening Saudi Arabia and</text>
  <text start="930.67" dur="6.969">we know in these 28 pages no matter what</text>
  <text start="934.699" dur="5.07">they are we know this is not going to be</text>
  <text start="937.639" dur="4.44">the truth we know it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="939.769" dur="3.721">directly point to Saudi Arabia they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="942.079" dur="3.69">going to make it seem like it really is</text>
  <text start="943.49" dur="5.279">actually probably the 28 pages is not</text>
  <text start="945.769" dur="5.31">going to say that much but when we</text>
  <text start="948.769" dur="4.771">really look at this we can see why they</text>
  <text start="951.079" dur="3.841">had this and why they kept it because</text>
  <text start="953.54" dur="2.609">they knew eventually what was going to</text>
  <text start="954.92" dur="2.909">happen because they knew the system was</text>
  <text start="956.149" dur="3.511">breaking down is they were going to have</text>
  <text start="957.829" dur="3.421">to threaten countries I mean if you look</text>
  <text start="959.66" dur="3.54">what Obama&amp;#39;s doing out in</text>
  <text start="961.25" dur="4.8">England trying to convince him to stay</text>
  <text start="963.2" dur="4.2">in the EU he&amp;#39;s out there threatening all</text>
  <text start="966.05" dur="3.9">of these countries is out there in</text>
  <text start="967.4" dur="4.92">Germany he&amp;#39;s out there in England he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="969.95" dur="4.56">in Saudi Arabia saying no you need to</text>
  <text start="972.32" dur="6.33">stay with us with the central banking</text>
  <text start="974.51" dur="6.36">system you cannot veer off and make it</text>
  <text start="978.65" dur="4.62">better for your people you can&amp;#39;t do any</text>
  <text start="980.87" dur="6.96">of this you need to stay with this</text>
  <text start="983.27" dur="6.63">failing economic system and if you</text>
  <text start="987.83" dur="4.41">really think about it if we believe the</text>
  <text start="989.9" dur="6.51">official story that Saudi Arabia really</text>
  <text start="992.24" dur="7.32">did 911 which we know Saudi Arabia was</text>
  <text start="996.41" dur="5.37">not the country that pulled off the</text>
  <text start="999.56" dur="4.26">entire operation of 911 we know it had</text>
  <text start="1001.78" dur="3.99">to be an inside job we know Israel was</text>
  <text start="1003.82" dur="3.54">involved with it there could have been</text>
  <text start="1005.77" dur="4.83">other countries yes we know there were a</text>
  <text start="1007.36" dur="5.67">lot of US agencies involved in this and</text>
  <text start="1010.6" dur="6.39">if we believe the official story of the</text>
  <text start="1013.03" dur="6.66">US and they held the 28 pages in the</text>
  <text start="1016.99" dur="5.37">deep basements of the administration and</text>
  <text start="1019.69" dur="4.26">they kept it locked under tight guard</text>
  <text start="1022.36" dur="4.32">but they leaked out that it was Saudi</text>
  <text start="1023.95" dur="7.34">Arabia basically what our government is</text>
  <text start="1026.68" dur="7.56">telling us is that the towers came down</text>
  <text start="1031.29" dur="7">Americans were killed and the US</text>
  <text start="1034.24" dur="11.459">government decided to protect another</text>
  <text start="1038.29" dur="12.09">country and could care less about the</text>
  <text start="1045.699" dur="10.171">people of the u.s. so it shows another</text>
  <text start="1050.38" dur="8.37">country over its own citizens they</text>
  <text start="1055.87" dur="6.96">decided to protect their financial</text>

  <text start="1074.56" dur="5.34">the country that did it and it&amp;#39;s amazing</text>
