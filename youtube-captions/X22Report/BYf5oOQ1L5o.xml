  <text start="104.22" dur="5.07">individuals that are talking about his</text>
  <text start="106.92" dur="4.83">tariffs saying tariffs aren&amp;#39;t good for</text>
  <text start="109.29" dur="4.32">this country tariffs do nothing and</text>
  <text start="111.75" dur="4.799">Trump just wants to set the record</text>
  <text start="113.61" dur="4.2">straight of why tariffs are good for the</text>
  <text start="116.549" dur="3.691">United States and yesterday we talked</text>
  <text start="117.81" dur="4.8">about how the central bank system the</text>
  <text start="120.24" dur="4.29">establishment they do not like tariffs</text>
  <text start="122.61" dur="6">Trump tweeted out the following Maria</text>
  <text start="124.53" dur="6.3">Dagon Steve steward V when you are the</text>
  <text start="128.61" dur="4.74">big piggy bank that other countries have</text>
  <text start="130.83" dur="3.96">been ripping off for years to a level</text>
  <text start="133.35" dur="3.75">that is not to be believed</text>
  <text start="134.79" dur="4.44">tariffs are a great negotiating tool a</text>
  <text start="137.1" dur="4.08">great revenue producer and most</text>
  <text start="139.23" dur="4.11">importantly a powerful way to get</text>
  <text start="141.18" dur="4.23">companies to come to the USA and to get</text>
  <text start="143.34" dur="4.53">companies that have left us for other</text>
  <text start="145.41" dur="4.889">lands to come back home we stupidly lost</text>
  <text start="147.87" dur="4.26">30% of our auto business to Mexico if</text>
  <text start="150.299" dur="4.861">the Chaves went on at the higher level</text>
  <text start="152.13" dur="4.71">they would all come back and pass but</text>
  <text start="155.16" dur="4.189">very happy with the deal I made if</text>
  <text start="156.84" dur="4.95">Mexico produces which I think they will</text>
  <text start="159.349" dur="3.761">biggest part of deal with Mexico has not</text>
  <text start="161.79" dur="2.7">been revealed</text>
  <text start="163.11" dur="3.27">China is similar</text>
  <text start="164.49" dur="4.17">except they devalue currency and</text>
  <text start="166.38" dur="5.22">subsidize companies to lessen effect of</text>
  <text start="168.66" dur="6.57">25% tariffs so far little effect to</text>
  <text start="171.6" dur="6.81">consumers companies will relocate to us</text>
  <text start="175.23" dur="7.5">and we need to remember Trump&amp;#39;s main</text>
  <text start="178.41" dur="7.29">mission is to bring companies the</text>
  <text start="182.73" dur="5.76">manufacturers all back to the United</text>
  <text start="185.7" dur="5.01">States because over the many years what</text>
  <text start="188.49" dur="3.39">the establishment the elite the central</text>
  <text start="190.71" dur="3.33">banks the deep state what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="191.88" dur="3.84">doing is they&amp;#39;ve been transferring all</text>
  <text start="194.04" dur="5.52">the companies manufacturers from this</text>
  <text start="195.72" dur="8.45">company to other areas and this was done</text>
  <text start="199.56" dur="7.08">on purpose now Trump he&amp;#39;s using all</text>
  <text start="204.17" dur="4.3">their weapons and I say they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="206.64" dur="5.34">central bank the deep state weapons</text>
  <text start="208.47" dur="6.33">against them but it looks like Trump he</text>
  <text start="211.98" dur="8.48">is going directly after those</text>
  <text start="214.8" dur="10.55">organizations that pushed companies</text>
  <text start="220.46" dur="9.01">manufacturers out of this country now</text>

  <text start="259.11" dur="5.88">trade policy Trump is now confronting</text>

  <text start="279.51" dur="5.1">willing or fearless enough to take them</text>
  <text start="281.37" dur="5.04">on until now a few days ago the US</text>
  <text start="284.61" dur="4.29">Chamber of Commerce threatened to sue</text>
  <text start="286.41" dur="5.1">President Trump over countervailing</text>
  <text start="288.9" dur="4.769">tariffs well Trump went after them and</text>
  <text start="291.51" dur="3.93">Trump is not just going to go after the</text>
  <text start="293.669" dur="4.441">Chamber of Commerce Trump is gonna go</text>

  <text start="314.52" dur="5.07">that are not working in the best</text>
  <text start="316.74" dur="5.61">interest of the United States so we have</text>
  <text start="319.59" dur="4.49">to ask the question if tariffs are so</text>
  <text start="322.35" dur="4.98">destructive so bad</text>
  <text start="324.08" dur="4.99">why is everyone except the US using them</text>
  <text start="327.33" dur="5.19">to protect their industry segments and</text>
  <text start="329.07" dur="5.34">economies the truth is the financial</text>
  <text start="332.52" dur="4.08">class and professional multinational</text>
  <text start="334.41" dur="5.58">lobbyists don&amp;#39;t want people to realize</text>
  <text start="336.6" dur="6.74">the modern trade system was designed to</text>
  <text start="339.99" dur="8.37">reduce American wealth it&amp;#39;s a feature</text>
  <text start="343.34" dur="7">it&amp;#39;s not a flaw it&amp;#39;s by design the</text>
  <text start="348.36" dur="4.95">collapse of US manufacturing did not</text>
  <text start="350.34" dur="5.97">happen accidentally the rest belt was</text>

  <text start="364.11" dur="8.76">lost accidentally wages did not stagnate</text>
  <text start="368.82" dur="7.44">accidentally all of this happened for a</text>
  <text start="372.87" dur="6.42">very specific reason this was all done</text>
  <text start="376.26" dur="5.07">by design think about the central bank</text>
  <text start="379.29" dur="5.939">think about what the deep state was</text>
  <text start="381.33" dur="5.82">doing think about all of this at the</text>
  <text start="385.229" dur="4.741">heart of the trade agreements over the</text>
  <text start="387.15" dur="4.89">past thirty years you&amp;#39;ll find that the</text>
  <text start="389.97" dur="4.02">US Chamber of Commerce yes a Wall Street</text>
  <text start="392.04" dur="5.82">multinational corporate lobbying group</text>
  <text start="393.99" dur="6.27">actually wrote three decades of Trade</text>
  <text start="397.86" dur="4.14">Agreement language now this is very</text>
  <text start="400.26" dur="4.89">interesting because we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="402" dur="7.11">before in the health industry who wrote</text>
  <text start="405.15" dur="7.56">the Obamacare laws well it was the</text>
  <text start="409.11" dur="5.82">health care industry why because they</text>
  <text start="412.71" dur="4.38">wanted to make a lot of money it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="414.93" dur="4.67">work out for them and just like the</text>
  <text start="417.09" dur="5.61">healthcare industry writing Obamacare</text>
  <text start="419.6" dur="5.41">what did the Chamber of Commerce - well</text>
  <text start="422.7" dur="4.56">they had a team of business experts from</text>
  <text start="425.01" dur="4.529">within the US Chamber of Commerce that</text>
  <text start="427.26" dur="3.7">wrote terms and conditions of actual</text>
  <text start="429.539" dur="7.181">trade agreements for</text>
  <text start="430.96" dur="9.51">in Bush Clinton Obama added up that&amp;#39;s 30</text>
  <text start="436.72" dur="6.24">years now look back to when this whole</text>
  <text start="440.47" dur="5.61">thing started do you think this was just</text>
  <text start="442.96" dur="4.13">a coincidence no this was done on</text>
  <text start="446.08" dur="3.44">purpose</text>
  <text start="447.09" dur="6.18">and remember for four consecutive</text>
  <text start="449.52" dur="7.299">administrations the chamber of commerce</text>
  <text start="453.27" dur="5.56">was there they were allowed to write the</text>
  <text start="456.819" dur="5.97">actual language in US trade deals and</text>
  <text start="458.83" dur="6.72">trade negotiations what did it do well</text>
  <text start="462.789" dur="7.371">it hurt the middle class actually it</text>
  <text start="465.55" dur="8.61">destroyed the middle class it destroyed</text>
  <text start="470.16" dur="7.3">manufacturing it destroyed everything</text>
  <text start="474.16" dur="6.689">that was built up prior to them and if</text>
  <text start="477.46" dur="7.34">you look at the lobbying clients the</text>

  <text start="564.11" dur="5.67">up everything is done away way ahead of</text>
  <text start="566.9" dur="4.47">time this way he can continually come</text>
  <text start="569.78" dur="3.63">out and say yes I do believe at trade</text>
  <text start="571.37" dur="6.06">deals coming yes I do believe if I use</text>
  <text start="573.41" dur="6.57">tariffs China will go ahead and make the</text>
  <text start="577.43" dur="5.1">deal with the United States he&amp;#39;s using</text>
  <text start="579.98" dur="4.59">this to show that he is right every</text>
  <text start="582.53" dur="4.83">single time the trade deals already made</text>
  <text start="584.57" dur="4.59">and now he&amp;#39;s letting the mainstream</text>
  <text start="587.36" dur="4.56">media the deep say the central bank the</text>
  <text start="589.16" dur="5.49">public in on what they&amp;#39;ve already agreed</text>
  <text start="591.92" dur="4.92">to now Trump in a CNBC telephone</text>

  <text start="607.07" dur="5.31">applied he predicted the US and China</text>
  <text start="610.16" dur="4.2">would work out a trade deal due to</text>
  <text start="612.38" dur="6.75">tariffs already in place on Chinese</text>
  <text start="614.36" dur="6.51">goods and the threat of more levees he</text>

  <text start="620.87" dur="6.84">you know why because of terrace we know</text>
  <text start="624.35" dur="6.6">already why it&amp;#39;s going to work out gee</text>

  <text start="633.59" dur="5.49">central bank and what did Trump come out</text>
  <text start="635.54" dur="5.4">and do well he went ahead and he hit</text>
  <text start="639.08" dur="4.29">hard at the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="640.94" dur="5.49">he said the Federal Reserve is making a</text>
  <text start="643.37" dur="6.15">big mistake they&amp;#39;ve raised interest</text>
  <text start="646.43" dur="5.67">rates too fast and what does he want</text>
  <text start="649.52" dur="7.23">them to do he wants them to cut rates he</text>
  <text start="652.1" dur="6.72">wants stimulus he went out and said they</text>
  <text start="656.75" dur="4.35">did quantitative tightening they were</text>
  <text start="658.82" dur="5.4">taking in 50 billion a month 50 billion</text>

  <text start="664.22" dur="5.67">still 25 billion a month which is</text>
  <text start="666.23" dur="6.24">ridiculous he said now China is just</text>
  <text start="669.89" dur="5.49">doing the opposite of the u.s. they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="672.47" dur="5.79">pumping money in so I&amp;#39;m winning but I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="681.38" dur="4.47">say they pump a lot of money into China</text>
  <text start="683.45" dur="5.64">and it&amp;#39;s and it nullifies to an extent</text>
  <text start="685.85" dur="5.31">not fully the tariffs he wants the Fed</text>
  <text start="689.09" dur="4.87">to go ahead and stimulate the economy</text>
