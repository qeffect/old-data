  <text start="46.339" dur="4.081">in all the warnings that the State</text>
  <text start="47.629" dur="5.041">Department has been given it looks like</text>
  <text start="50.42" dur="5.069">they&amp;#39;re trying to tell everyone that</text>
  <text start="52.67" dur="5.549">something is on its way and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="55.489" dur="4.14">discuss that later on in the report but</text>
  <text start="58.219" dur="4.46">let&amp;#39;s take a look I mean the stock</text>
  <text start="59.629" dur="6.42">market is hitting all-time new highs</text>
  <text start="62.679" dur="6.341">gold is staying around 1,300 because we</text>
  <text start="66.049" dur="4.86">can&amp;#39;t have gold going up that would make</text>
  <text start="69.02" dur="4.22">people think you know that something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="70.909" dur="5.881">wrong so if goal keeps you know</text>
  <text start="73.24" dur="6.94">continually Falls and the stock market</text>
  <text start="76.79" dur="6.24">goes up and the job the unemployment</text>
  <text start="80.18" dur="6.72">rate goes down everything looks</text>
  <text start="83.03" dur="6.03">fantastic and but when you dig deeper</text>
  <text start="86.9" dur="4.35">into the numbers and you look at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="89.06" dur="5.64">really going on it&amp;#39;s not as great as it</text>
  <text start="91.25" dur="6.42">seems but let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="94.7" dur="4.59">collapse news now Spain came out and</text>
  <text start="97.67" dur="4.94">they said they were going to suffer at</text>
  <text start="99.29" dur="7.38">least a 25 percent unemployment until</text>
  <text start="102.61" dur="6.85">2018 now it&amp;#39;s 2013 right now so for the</text>
  <text start="106.67" dur="5.28">next five years they&amp;#39;re going to stay</text>
  <text start="109.46" dur="4.26">around twenty five percent or so or</text>
  <text start="111.95" dur="4.95">maybe higher and I&amp;#39;m going to say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="113.72" dur="5.79">going to be much much higher because if</text>
  <text start="116.9" dur="6.24">they have this problem now there are no</text>
  <text start="119.51" dur="6.63">solutions that they have except to give</text>
  <text start="123.14" dur="5.28">each country more and more debt and with</text>
  <text start="126.14" dur="9.17">the amount of people unemployed or</text>
  <text start="128.42" dur="6.89">underemployed or undisciplined</text>
  <text start="140.26" dur="3.509">that means people do not have disposable</text>
  <text start="141.909" dur="3.991">income if you do not have disposable</text>
  <text start="143.769" dur="4.47">income people are not buying things at</text>
  <text start="145.9" dur="5.07">retail stores if people are not buying</text>
  <text start="148.239" dur="6.271">things at retail stores stores closed</text>
  <text start="150.97" dur="7.26">down houses aren&amp;#39;t built cars aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="154.51" dur="5.49">sold and the government loses revenue as</text>
  <text start="158.23" dur="3.569">the government loses revenue what do</text>
  <text start="160" dur="4.709">they have to do they need to take out</text>
  <text start="161.799" dur="5.701">more debt what is more debt give you it</text>
  <text start="164.709" dur="3.87">gives you higher interest payments but</text>
  <text start="167.5" dur="3.359">they don&amp;#39;t have the revenue to cover</text>
  <text start="168.579" dur="4.711">that so what do you have to do you have</text>
  <text start="170.859" dur="5.581">to take out more debt to cover the old</text>
  <text start="173.29" dur="5.9">debt and it&amp;#39;s a continuous cycle so when</text>
  <text start="176.44" dur="5.219">a government official comes out and says</text>
  <text start="179.19" dur="5.469">that unemployment for the next five</text>
  <text start="181.659" dur="5.55">years just that alone should scare</text>
  <text start="184.659" dur="4.771">everyone in Spain for the next five</text>
  <text start="187.209" dur="4.741">years twenty-five percent or maybe a</text>
  <text start="189.43" dur="6.619">little bit higher again government</text>
  <text start="191.95" dur="7.08">officials always tell you the opposite</text>
  <text start="196.049" dur="5.41">the opposite is it&amp;#39;s going to be 10</text>
  <text start="199.03" dur="7.349">times worse of what this official is</text>
  <text start="201.459" dur="7.351">saying now the unemployment numbers came</text>
  <text start="206.379" dur="6.871">out today and we see unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="208.81" dur="6.72">drop to 7.4 percent and of course all</text>
  <text start="213.25" dur="4.199">those people around the country going oh</text>
  <text start="215.53" dur="4.109">my god the economy is getting so much</text>
  <text start="217.449" dur="6.951">better look at this we&amp;#39;re down to seven</text>
  <text start="219.639" dur="4.761">point four percent this is fantastic and</text>
  <text start="224.489" dur="6.58">but we just added a hundred and</text>
  <text start="227.859" dur="4.891">sixty-two thousand jobs now out of the</text>
  <text start="231.069" dur="3.841">hundred and sixty-two thousand they</text>
  <text start="232.75" dur="4.859">expected a hundred and eighty-five</text>
  <text start="234.91" dur="8.219">thousand new jobs in July but it was</text>
  <text start="237.609" dur="8.25">only 162 why well 37 thousand workers</text>
  <text start="243.129" dur="4.741">dropped out of the labor force when you</text>
  <text start="245.859" dur="5.401">have people dropping at a labor force</text>
  <text start="247.87" dur="6.72">the government has their new formula</text>
  <text start="251.26" dur="5.25">since 1994 which doesn&amp;#39;t include them so</text>
  <text start="254.59" dur="4.47">you use the manipulated numbers and you</text>
  <text start="256.51" dur="4.949">get seven point four percent which is</text>
  <text start="259.06" dur="6">perfect and this is what they wanted and</text>
  <text start="261.459" dur="7.671">you know if we look around and we see</text>
  <text start="265.06" dur="8.94">you know other jobs there are roughly</text>
  <text start="269.13" dur="8.38">nine let me see there&amp;#39;s 988</text>
  <text start="274" dur="6.48">people right now from the beginning of</text>
  <text start="277.51" dur="6.78">this year not looking for work anymore</text>
  <text start="280.48" dur="7.29">because there are no jobs that is a lot</text>
  <text start="284.29" dur="9.05">of people and if we delve a little bit</text>
  <text start="287.77" dur="9.68">deeper into this there&amp;#39;s there have been</text>
  <text start="293.34" dur="7.24">246,000 waiter and bartender jobs added</text>
  <text start="297.45" dur="5.47">there only have been 24,000</text>
  <text start="300.58" dur="6.96">manufacturing jobs added at this point</text>
  <text start="302.92" dur="6.9">so if you take the ratio there are the</text>
  <text start="307.54" dur="6.66">ratio of waiters and bartenders to</text>
  <text start="309.82" dur="8.31">manufacturing jobs it&amp;#39;s ten to one now</text>
  <text start="314.2" dur="5.76">we have also seen that construction of</text>
  <text start="318.13" dur="3.84">course you know if you look at the real</text>
  <text start="319.96" dur="3.51">numbers people having part-time work or</text>
  <text start="321.97" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re not even looking for work</text>
  <text start="323.47" dur="5.63">anymore because there are no jobs out</text>
  <text start="325.06" dur="8.82">there construction just out of the blue</text>
  <text start="329.1" dur="7.21">unexpectedly fell in June and you know</text>
  <text start="333.88" dur="7.05">construction spending drop point six</text>
  <text start="336.31" dur="7.919">percent and this is the biggest decline</text>
  <text start="340.93" dur="7.83">since January well let&amp;#39;s think about</text>
  <text start="344.229" dur="8.041">this mortgage applications have been</text>
  <text start="348.76" dur="7.32">plunging builders had said traffic has</text>
  <text start="352.27" dur="5.73">been slowing down even though the job</text>
  <text start="356.08" dur="5.91">numbers are telling it seven point four</text>
  <text start="358" dur="6.78">percent if we use the old calculation we</text>
  <text start="361.99" dur="7.71">have just increased to almost twenty</text>
  <text start="364.78" dur="8.61">four percent so we have mortgage</text>
  <text start="369.7" dur="7.79">applications plunging we have disposable</text>
  <text start="373.39" dur="7.47">income plunging we have retail stores</text>
  <text start="377.49" dur="6.04">closing all over America back in January</text>
  <text start="380.86" dur="4.559">February USA today reported that there</text>
  <text start="383.53" dur="4.86">were hundreds upon hundreds of stores</text>
  <text start="385.419" dur="4.891">closing which what happens is those</text>
  <text start="388.39" dur="5.4">people who had those part-time jobs and</text>
  <text start="390.31" dur="9">some are full those jobs are no longer</text>
  <text start="393.79" dur="11.64">exist retail just came in that their</text>
  <text start="399.31" dur="8.34">sales are down and people&amp;#39;s credit you</text>
  <text start="405.43" dur="3.989">know because of all the foreclosures</text>
  <text start="407.65" dur="4.079">and people who have part-time work and</text>
  <text start="409.419" dur="4.711">people who are not employed where people</text>
  <text start="411.729" dur="6.121">aren&amp;#39;t disability have no credit at this</text>
  <text start="414.13" dur="6.36">point so with no credit and all this</text>
  <text start="417.85" dur="6.96">other information how our construction</text>
  <text start="420.49" dur="6.84">costs going to rise they&amp;#39;re falling</text>
  <text start="424.81" dur="5.34">because nobody can afford any of this</text>
  <text start="427.33" dur="9.27">anymore that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re falling the</text>
  <text start="430.15" dur="10.079">hedge funds that are investing in the</text>
  <text start="436.6" dur="7.14">homes to inflate the real estate bubble</text>
  <text start="440.229" dur="8.341">they are selling those off because they</text>
  <text start="443.74" dur="6.81">realize that homes are not increasing in</text>
  <text start="448.57" dur="4.349">the amount that they want and this</text>
  <text start="450.55" dur="7.02">renting gig that they signed up for is</text>
  <text start="452.919" dur="9.841">not working out and here is the problem</text>
  <text start="457.57" dur="9">there are no real people in the market</text>
  <text start="462.76" dur="6.839">it is all fake it is all made up and</text>
  <text start="466.57" dur="5.969">this is the major problem and it&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="469.599" dur="4.29">how they say unexpectedly like they</text>
  <text start="472.539" dur="3.991">don&amp;#39;t know why if you just put all the</text>
  <text start="473.889" dur="5.671">pieces together you can see why things</text>
  <text start="476.53" dur="7.62">are happening okay let&amp;#39;s move on to that</text>
  <text start="479.56" dur="6.599">here now the government is out there</text>

  <text start="493.419" dur="5.93">everything in check and they still have</text>
  <text start="496.18" dur="5.43">the same puppet government in Egypt</text>

  <text start="501.61" dur="5.67">same government that&amp;#39;s in charge and the</text>
  <text start="505.09" dur="8.04">US and the central bankers have control</text>
  <text start="507.28" dur="7.77">over them and what we&amp;#39;re seeing here but</text>

  <text start="547.41" dur="7.89">like the Japanese South Korea we would</text>
  <text start="552.6" dur="5.37">like to have the wartime command</text>
  <text start="555.3" dur="6.11">transfer back to them the Japanese have</text>
  <text start="557.97" dur="6.989">to vote on it in their constitution and</text>
  <text start="561.41" dur="5.859">they would like to vote on it and give</text>
  <text start="564.959" dur="5.88">them the authority to engage if they</text>
  <text start="567.269" dur="6.151">have to and South Korea also wants to do</text>
  <text start="570.839" dur="4.831">the same thing they&amp;#39;re not sure if</text>
  <text start="573.42" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re ready to do it and and take on</text>
  <text start="575.67" dur="5.58">this responsibility but this is all in</text>
  <text start="578.07" dur="5.579">preparation for World War three that</text>
  <text start="581.25" dur="7.32">will be coming down the line to cover up</text>
  <text start="583.649" dur="7.171">this economic collapse now China were in</text>
  <text start="588.57" dur="4.68">the disputed waters and the chap- goat</text>

  <text start="598.589" dur="5.821">disputed islands in the East China Sea</text>
  <text start="600.329" dur="7.081">and we&amp;#39;re seeing this a lot and this is</text>
  <text start="604.41" dur="6.179">the flexing of muscles and proving that</text>
  <text start="607.41" dur="5.85">they can go into this space if they want</text>
  <text start="610.589" dur="6.06">to but eventually things will get out of</text>
  <text start="613.26" dur="6">hand like they always do and things will</text>
  <text start="616.649" dur="5.281">start to fall apart now in preparation</text>
