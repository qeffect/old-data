  <text start="163.62" dur="3.35">of the Ukraine situation and if you</text>
  <text start="165.63" dur="4.53">really look at the Ukraine situation</text>
  <text start="166.97" dur="6.49">what did Russia actually really do</text>
  <text start="170.16" dur="5.16">because from my point of view I see the</text>
  <text start="173.46" dur="4.56">United States central bankers and NATO</text>
  <text start="175.32" dur="4.2">inside of Ukraine calling the shots with</text>
  <text start="178.02" dur="4.05">the banksters because they&amp;#39;re part of</text>
  <text start="179.52" dur="5.16">the whole banking system and they have</text>
  <text start="182.07" dur="4.95">this anti-terrorism force going after</text>
  <text start="184.68" dur="4.35">people inside the country who want to be</text>
  <text start="187.02" dur="4.86">separate and apart from the puppet</text>
  <text start="189.03" dur="5.67">regime I see a referendum in Crimea</text>
  <text start="191.88" dur="5.52">there was international countries and</text>
  <text start="194.7" dur="4.71">observers in Crimea taking a look at the</text>
  <text start="197.4" dur="4.62">referendum everyone said it was peaceful</text>
  <text start="199.41" dur="5.25">it was a huge turnout and they decided</text>
  <text start="202.02" dur="4.92">to separate themselves from Ukraine</text>
  <text start="204.66" dur="4.56">there were no troops there was no firing</text>
  <text start="206.94" dur="5.28">there was absolutely nothing going on</text>
  <text start="209.22" dur="6.6">what I see now is united states central</text>
  <text start="212.22" dur="6.57">bankers NATO EU in there directing the</text>
  <text start="215.82" dur="6.6">anti-terrorism forces to to fire</text>
  <text start="218.79" dur="6.18">missiles to bomb to shoot to kill people</text>
  <text start="222.42" dur="4.47">and these are everyday working people</text>
  <text start="224.97" dur="4.95">inside the country we see this happening</text>
  <text start="226.89" dur="5.46">in the Middle East we see it in Africa</text>
  <text start="229.92" dur="4.89">this is part of the playbook and every</text>
  <text start="232.35" dur="3.78">single time the United States central</text>
  <text start="234.81" dur="3.179">bankers come out there and say you</text>
  <text start="236.13" dur="4.98">Russia needs to de-escalate the</text>
  <text start="237.989" dur="6.361">situation no just stop using the forces</text>
  <text start="241.11" dur="5.34">that your talent that that the IMF and</text>
  <text start="244.35" dur="4.2">the World Bank has been telling them to</text>
  <text start="246.45" dur="4.05">do because they will not receive the</text>
  <text start="248.55" dur="3.659">money if they don&amp;#39;t do it so all you</text>
  <text start="250.5" dur="3.959">have to do is say listen you&amp;#39;ll still</text>
  <text start="252.209" dur="4.111">get the money even if the southeast</text>
  <text start="254.459" dur="4.021">decides they don&amp;#39;t want to be part of</text>
  <text start="256.32" dur="4.229">Ukraine and guess what they&amp;#39;d be no more</text>
  <text start="258.48" dur="3.87">killing there&amp;#39;d be nothing but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="260.549" dur="3.541">not what they want they want the entire</text>
  <text start="262.35" dur="4.2">country that&amp;#39;s why the NATO leader</text>
  <text start="264.09" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;s why poroshenko is out there</text>
  <text start="266.55" dur="3.84">saying that they&amp;#39;re going to get Crimea</text>
  <text start="267.81" dur="4.62">back this is why there&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="270.39" dur="3.24">anti-terrorism forces on these people</text>
  <text start="272.43" dur="2.28">this is why they&amp;#39;re pushing their agenda</text>
  <text start="273.63" dur="4.11">Ford</text>
  <text start="274.71" dur="7.59">they are doing this because they want</text>
  <text start="277.74" dur="7.11">the entire country of Ukraine this was</text>
  <text start="282.3" dur="5.07">the deal from the beginning and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="284.85" dur="6.27">working out and we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="287.37" dur="5.61">is many nations they&amp;#39;re looking around</text>
  <text start="291.12" dur="4.37">and they&amp;#39;re saying okay the Empire of</text>

  <text start="321.27" dur="5.01">that this is the end game and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="4.17">starting to lose faith in the dollar and</text>

  <text start="479.53" dur="4.35">news and we&amp;#39;re seeing that the</text>
  <text start="481.18" dur="5.37">government has come out with their new</text>
  <text start="483.88" dur="4.26">figures on unemployment and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="486.55" dur="4.17">saying that two hundred and seventeen</text>
  <text start="488.14" dur="5.52">thousand jobs were seasonally adjusted</text>
  <text start="490.72" dur="4.35">they were added and pretty much the</text>
  <text start="493.66" dur="3.63">unemployment rate is staying at six</text>
  <text start="495.07" dur="5.73">point three percent and they want</text>
  <text start="497.29" dur="6.24">everyone to you know believe that yes</text>
  <text start="500.8" dur="5.22">see we&amp;#39;re in a recovery we&amp;#39;re holding</text>
  <text start="503.53" dur="4.41">steady at six point three percent but</text>
  <text start="506.02" dur="3.6">what&amp;#39;s really happening is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="507.94" dur="3.66">continually manipulating numbers the</text>
  <text start="509.62" dur="4.53">hold that the unemployment study for</text>
  <text start="511.6" dur="3.93">most likely another month and then</text>
  <text start="514.15" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;ll bring it down because we know we</text>
  <text start="515.53" dur="4.08">have elections coming up very very soon</text>
  <text start="517.78" dur="4.08">so they&amp;#39;ll start bringing it down a</text>
  <text start="519.61" dur="4.08">little bit showing that look things are</text>
  <text start="521.86" dur="4.62">even getting better than we thought and</text>
  <text start="523.69" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;re in this fantastic recovery and we</text>
  <text start="526.48" dur="4.47">know we are not we know these numbers</text>
  <text start="528.73" dur="4.98">are manipulated and right now the number</text>
  <text start="530.95" dur="5.48">of women 16 and older who were</text>
  <text start="533.71" dur="6.06">unemployed the United States climbed by</text>
  <text start="536.43" dur="5.49">60,000 in May in May there were four</text>

  <text start="2520.89" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re calling on additional resources</text>
  <text start="2523.08" dur="7.16">to help them out they called on Britain</text>
  <text start="2526.26" dur="7.44">they called on us to help prove that</text>

  <text start="2543.45" dur="3">percent</text>
  <text start="2544.02" dur="5.55">of the chemical weapons still inside the</text>
