  <text start="110.5" dur="6.12">collapse financial news now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="113.44" dur="4.8">interesting about the economic narrative</text>
  <text start="116.62" dur="4.07">which Trump controls right now the</text>
  <text start="118.24" dur="5.58">Patriots control the economic narrative</text>
  <text start="120.69" dur="5.92">we still need to understand that the</text>
  <text start="123.82" dur="6.12">deep state the central bank they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="126.61" dur="5.01">still going to try to take control and</text>
  <text start="129.94" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re going to do it any way they</text>
  <text start="131.62" dur="6.99">possibly can now on Friday we mentioned</text>
  <text start="134.83" dur="6.39">how Facebook is creating this crypto</text>
  <text start="138.61" dur="5.82">currency called Libra and the Fed was</text>
  <text start="141.22" dur="5.79">out there Jerome Powell and Trump they</text>
  <text start="144.43" dur="5.13">both said this is dangerous and the</text>
  <text start="147.01" dur="6.36">reason why they said this is because the</text>
  <text start="149.56" dur="7.74">deep state the central bank&amp;#39;s they know</text>
  <text start="153.37" dur="7.229">if they can crash this economy it will</text>
  <text start="157.3" dur="5.639">be completely blamed on Trump</text>
  <text start="160.599" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re trying to do and</text>
  <text start="162.939" dur="2.16">they&amp;#39;re doing it any way they possibly</text>
  <text start="164.349" dur="3.241">can</text>
  <text start="165.099" dur="4.92">now remember queue has been telling us</text>
  <text start="167.59" dur="4.229">that the mainstream media is the arm of</text>
  <text start="170.019" dur="3.84">the Democratic Party part of the deep</text>
  <text start="171.819" dur="4.7">state which is connected to the central</text>
  <text start="173.859" dur="5.55">banking system and they realize that</text>
  <text start="176.519" dur="7.45">Trump and the Patriots they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="179.409" dur="9.72">after the source the source of what they</text>
  <text start="183.969" dur="8.67">use to push their agenda and they will</text>
  <text start="189.129" dur="6.78">try to stop it any way they possibly can</text>
  <text start="192.639" dur="4.8">but I find very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="195.909" dur="2.94">mainstream media is out there and</text>
  <text start="197.439" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re saying all these rate cuts and</text>
  <text start="198.849" dur="6.211">the stimulus it&amp;#39;s not going to help the</text>
  <text start="201.639" dur="7.32">economy grow it won&amp;#39;t make the economy</text>
  <text start="205.06" dur="8.37">any better that&amp;#39;s not the purpose of the</text>
  <text start="208.959" dur="7.98">rate cuts of stimulus the purpose of it</text>
  <text start="213.43" dur="5.97">is so the economy doesn&amp;#39;t crash it won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="216.939" dur="5.7">improve a central bank system the</text>
  <text start="219.4" dur="6.209">central bank system is doomed all Trump</text>
  <text start="222.639" dur="6.59">wants to do he wants to keep the system</text>
  <text start="225.609" dur="7.8">alive long enough so it doesn&amp;#39;t crash</text>
  <text start="229.229" dur="6.16">he&amp;#39;s not doing it to fix the economy</text>
  <text start="233.409" dur="4.561">because if that was the case guess what</text>
  <text start="235.389" dur="4.44">we would have very very low interest</text>
  <text start="237.97" dur="4.32">rate to the negative territory and we</text>
  <text start="239.829" dur="5.25">have we would have stimulus all over the</text>
  <text start="242.29" dur="5.819">place and they would never stop it no</text>
  <text start="245.079" dur="6.211">his whole entire strategy is to keep</text>
  <text start="248.109" dur="6.78">this broken economy this illusion of an</text>
  <text start="251.29" dur="7.74">economy from crashing that&amp;#39;s it without</text>
  <text start="254.889" dur="5.551">this it would it would crash and he</text>
  <text start="259.03" dur="4.08">knows that he can&amp;#39;t allow this to happen</text>
  <text start="260.44" dur="4.17">because he needs to win the 2020</text>
  <text start="263.11" dur="3.6">election this is why you see the</text>
  <text start="264.61" dur="4.32">mainstream media out there saying over</text>
  <text start="266.71" dur="6.179">very close to a recession because they</text>
  <text start="268.93" dur="6.09">know they know that this system can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="272.889" dur="3.991">last I mean if it was the other way</text>
  <text start="275.02" dur="5.22">around with Clinton in office they tell</text>
  <text start="276.88" dur="5.55">you how great the economy was while it</text>
  <text start="280.24" dur="4.41">was completely falling apart and then as</text>
  <text start="282.43" dur="3.959">it was falling apart we would have maybe</text>
  <text start="284.65" dur="3.15">cyber attacks or whatever from another</text>
  <text start="286.389" dur="3.631">country and they would blame the</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="4.799">collapse on that other country well they</text>
  <text start="290.02" dur="4.38">don&amp;#39;t have that story right now so</text>
  <text start="292.599" dur="4.501">they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out a way</text>
  <text start="294.4" dur="4.92">to control the narrative but when Trump</text>
  <text start="297.1" dur="3.81">was mentioning all of this in his tweets</text>
  <text start="299.32" dur="5.159">that which which we mentioned on Friday</text>
  <text start="300.91" dur="7.02">he said something very interesting at</text>
  <text start="304.479" dur="9.591">the end of his tweet and he mentioned</text>
  <text start="307.93" dur="11.13">the United States dollar now we know</text>
  <text start="314.07" dur="9.849">right now that there is no United States</text>
  <text start="319.06" dur="8.16">note or dollar what is it called it is</text>
  <text start="323.919" dur="7.111">called the Federal Reserve Note look at</text>
  <text start="327.22" dur="5.34">any of your bills today $1 $5 20 hunt</text>
  <text start="331.03" dur="6.15">doesn&amp;#39;t make a difference look at the</text>
  <text start="332.56" dur="6.359">top it says Federal Reserve Note yes</text>
  <text start="337.18" dur="3.12">maybe on the side it says the United</text>
  <text start="338.919" dur="3.661">States of America but it would be a</text>
  <text start="340.3" dur="3.239">Federal Reserve Note of the United</text>
  <text start="342.58" dur="2.459">States of America</text>
  <text start="343.539" dur="5.221">I remember the Federal Reserve is a</text>
  <text start="345.039" dur="7.231">private corporation now if we go back in</text>
  <text start="348.76" dur="6.57">time and we look at older bills before</text>
  <text start="352.27" dur="5.34">we came off the gold standard and the</text>
  <text start="355.33" dur="4.68">Federal Reserve started to ramp up their</text>
  <text start="357.61" dur="7.11">agenda and you look at them it says</text>
  <text start="360.01" dur="8.52">United States note and if you go way way</text>
  <text start="364.72" dur="7.11">back before the Federal Reserve it</text>
  <text start="368.53" dur="5.52">continually says this and on some</text>
  <text start="371.83" dur="5.459">instances you were able to take that</text>
  <text start="374.05" dur="5.82">paper currency which was a note which</text>
  <text start="377.289" dur="4.621">was connected to silver or gold you were</text>
  <text start="379.87" dur="5.16">able to go into a bank and say okay I</text>
  <text start="381.91" dur="6.92">would like my silver for this raincheck</text>
  <text start="385.03" dur="7.53">I would like my gold for this rain check</text>
  <text start="388.83" dur="5.89">now when we take a look at the United</text>
  <text start="392.56" dur="4.229">States note you could see that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.72" dur="6.259">completely different the United States</text>
  <text start="396.789" dur="7.771">created this not the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="400.979" dur="4.331">they weren&amp;#39;t creating this currency out</text>
  <text start="404.56" dur="4.32">of thin air</text>
  <text start="405.31" dur="6.57">this was still attached to gold now when</text>
  <text start="408.88" dur="7.11">Trump was out there and he was tweeting</text>
  <text start="411.88" dur="8.43">he said the United States dollar not the</text>
  <text start="415.99" dur="7.56">Federal Reserve Note now think about</text>
  <text start="420.31" dur="5.49">that for a second is Trump signaling</text>
  <text start="423.55" dur="4.13">that we&amp;#39;re going to be returning to the</text>
  <text start="425.8" dur="5.67">United States</text>
  <text start="427.68" dur="5.98">it seems that way now if we fast-forward</text>
  <text start="431.47" dur="5.13">to today and we talked about this before</text>
  <text start="433.66" dur="5.67">and we look at the $100 bill this is</text>
  <text start="436.6" dur="7.47">very interesting like we&amp;#39;ve said in the</text>
  <text start="439.33" dur="7.92">past the $100 bill is split in half and</text>
  <text start="444.07" dur="5.49">they made it completely obvious with</text>
  <text start="447.25" dur="6.03">this blue line which is a security line</text>
  <text start="449.56" dur="8.19">but on one side it says Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="453.28" dur="6.93">Note and it&amp;#39;s in the colors that all the</text>
  <text start="457.75" dur="5.04">bills have always been in on the right</text>
  <text start="460.21" dur="5.28">hand side it has an inkwell the</text>
  <text start="462.79" dur="4.2">Constitution everything&amp;#39;s in gold and</text>
  <text start="465.49" dur="4.17">the you just and it says the United</text>
  <text start="466.99" dur="4.61">States of America and it says this note</text>
  <text start="469.66" dur="7.02">is legal tender for all debts public and</text>
  <text start="471.6" dur="8.29">private which tells us on the left is</text>
  <text start="476.68" dur="7.44">the old bill the old Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="479.89" dur="7.83">Note which mimics all the other bills on</text>
  <text start="484.12" dur="4.17">the right hand side is where we are</text>
  <text start="487.72" dur="5.1">headed</text>
  <text start="488.29" dur="8.34">there&amp;#39;s color there is the Constitution</text>
  <text start="492.82" dur="6.21">and it shows that this will be the</text>
  <text start="496.63" dur="7.29">United States note we&amp;#39;re going to leave</text>
  <text start="499.03" dur="7.05">behind the Federal Reserve Note so I do</text>
  <text start="503.92" dur="4.86">believe when Trump was out there telling</text>
  <text start="506.08" dur="4.47">us listen we know what the deep state is</text>
  <text start="508.78" dur="5.069">up to we know that they&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="510.55" dur="5.28">crash this economy we know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="513.849" dur="4.771">trying to use different methods of</text>
  <text start="515.83" dur="5.43">crashing the system before I&amp;#39;m elected</text>
  <text start="518.62" dur="5.82">in 2020 because if they can crash the</text>
  <text start="521.26" dur="5.88">system they know they will control the</text>
  <text start="524.44" dur="5.61">economic narrative Trump right now</text>
  <text start="527.14" dur="4.47">controls the economic narrative and you</text>
  <text start="530.05" dur="4.32">can see with the people that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="531.61" dur="6.96">placing into the Federal Reserve he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="534.37" dur="6.87">preparing for this transition and if you</text>
  <text start="538.57" dur="7.32">look at the bigger picture he is going</text>
  <text start="541.24" dur="9.06">after the source that funds all of their</text>
  <text start="545.89" dur="9.48">agendas and they will try to stop this</text>
  <text start="550.3" dur="8.49">any way they possibly can and I do</text>
  <text start="555.37" dur="5.55">believe and I&amp;#39;ve said this before that</text>
  <text start="558.79" dur="6.209">Trump will continue to contradict</text>
  <text start="560.92" dur="5.939">the Fed the Fed will lower rates they</text>
  <text start="564.999" dur="5.58">will start stimulus by the end of this</text>
  <text start="566.859" dur="6.75">year probably in late summer fall you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="570.579" dur="5.61">see the economy stabilize you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="573.609" dur="4.92">things improve a little bit you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="576.189" dur="3.75">the stock market move up Trump will make</text>
  <text start="578.529" dur="3.78">a really big deal look at the market</text>
  <text start="579.939" dur="4.5">moving up look at S&amp;amp;P moving up look at</text>
  <text start="582.309" dur="4.53">unemployment moving down everything</text>
  <text start="584.439" dur="5.19">looks fantastic he will then have</text>
  <text start="586.839" dur="4.86">complete and utter control of the</text>
  <text start="589.629" dur="4.02">economic system that is doesn&amp;#39;t mean the</text>
  <text start="591.699" dur="3.42">deep state they aren&amp;#39;t going to try to</text>
  <text start="593.649" dur="3.36">push their agenda during this period of</text>
  <text start="595.119" dur="5.94">time because they know if he gets</text>
