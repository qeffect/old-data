  <text start="142.22" dur="5.67">aggression he&amp;#39;s confirmed a new defense</text>
  <text start="145.79" dur="4.83">concept that reflects the highest threat</text>
  <text start="147.89" dur="5.94">of aggression from Russia and with his</text>
  <text start="150.62" dur="7.86">document about this he says that the</text>
  <text start="153.83" dur="7.59">threat still remains from Russia the</text>
  <text start="158.48" dur="4.5">destructing Russia is destructing the</text>

  <text start="162.98" dur="4.11">of destroying Ukraine</text>
  <text start="164.33" dur="4.71">and taking over its territory they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="167.09" dur="5.58">using military force as well as</text>
  <text start="169.04" dur="6.24">technological hybrid war and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="172.67" dur="5.7">that Russia has temporary occupied</text>
  <text start="175.28" dur="5.25">Crimea and they&amp;#39;re taking further</text>
  <text start="178.37" dur="5.55">actions to destabilize the situation in</text>
  <text start="180.53" dur="8.64">the region specifically the Baltic area</text>
  <text start="183.92" dur="7.44">the Caspian Seas the Black Sea and we</text>
  <text start="189.17" dur="6.36">can see at this point that they are</text>
  <text start="191.36" dur="8.55">preparing to go after Russia once again</text>
  <text start="195.53" dur="9.09">and they&amp;#39;re going to continually do this</text>
  <text start="199.91" dur="9.92">until they get a war started this is</text>
  <text start="204.62" dur="8.46">their main objective we see out in Libya</text>
  <text start="209.83" dur="4.57">the Security Council today they extended</text>
  <text start="213.08" dur="3.27">the Mandate of the United Nations</text>
  <text start="214.4" dur="4.44">support mission in Libya until June</text>
  <text start="216.35" dur="4.859">fifteenth recognizing the need for a</text>
  <text start="218.84" dur="4.26">short-term extension so it can continue</text>
  <text start="221.209" dur="6.541">working with the country to establish a</text>
  <text start="223.1" dur="6.09">unity government now out in Libya we see</text>
  <text start="227.75" dur="3.51">the proxy army for the United States</text>
  <text start="229.19" dur="5.07">government central bankers they are</text>
  <text start="231.26" dur="6.84">still working to create chaos in the</text>
  <text start="234.26" dur="7.02">region and what they normally do is they</text>
  <text start="238.1" dur="6">hit the infrastructure of the country to</text>
  <text start="241.28" dur="5.19">force the people into saying we need</text>
  <text start="244.1" dur="6.23">help we need help so right now they have</text>
  <text start="246.47" dur="8.22">their proxy army hitting water plants</text>
  <text start="250.33" dur="6.339">near Libyan oil fields and the water</text>
  <text start="254.69" dur="4.49">plant is part of the great man-made</text>
  <text start="256.669" dur="5.341">River which was built by moammar qaddafi</text>
  <text start="259.18" dur="6.1">to pipe water from the desert wells to</text>
  <text start="262.01" dur="5.55">coastal communities and we see that they</text>
  <text start="265.28" dur="4.23">did this in Syria where they hit the</text>
  <text start="267.56" dur="5.82">infrastructure the power infrastructure</text>
  <text start="269.51" dur="5.61">the water systems and the US always</text>
  <text start="273.38" dur="3.84">takes this approach they like to destroy</text>
  <text start="275.12" dur="4.38">the infrastructure of the country so</text>
  <text start="277.22" dur="4.53">that people suffer look what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="279.5" dur="6.3">in Yemen look at Lebanon look at Libya</text>
  <text start="281.75" dur="6.69">look at Ukraine they continually do the</text>
  <text start="285.8" dur="5.31">same thing it&amp;#39;s the same MO now the</text>
  <text start="288.44" dur="6.93">unity government they&amp;#39;re trying to force</text>
  <text start="291.11" dur="6.21">their way into Tripoli and the Prime</text>
  <text start="295.37" dur="2.759">Minister of Tripoli the self-declared</text>
  <text start="297.32" dur="3.48">government</text>
  <text start="298.129" dur="5.46">people&amp;#39;s government has warned Libya&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="300.8" dur="6.569">un-backed cabinet based in Tunis</text>
  <text start="303.589" dur="7.11">remember they&amp;#39;re not even in Libya not</text>
  <text start="307.369" dur="5.94">to come to the capital saying such a</text>
  <text start="310.699" dur="4.08">move would be illegal and they would</text>
  <text start="313.309" dur="5.22">face arrest now they can come there</text>
  <text start="314.779" dur="7.53">individually as Libyans but as a</text>
  <text start="318.529" dur="6.75">government they cannot and we know that</text>
  <text start="322.309" dur="5.78">France the United States the coalition</text>
  <text start="325.279" dur="8.13">forces they want the unity government</text>
  <text start="328.089" dur="7.81">inside of Libya to push a major</text>
  <text start="333.409" dur="8.76">offensive in this area so they can wipe</text>
  <text start="335.899" dur="7.83">out those people who are against the new</text>
  <text start="342.169" dur="3.15">puppet regime and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="343.729" dur="3.511">going to call them terrorists they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="345.319" dur="3.84">call them al Qaeda they&amp;#39;ll call them the</text>
  <text start="347.24" dur="4.259">Islamic state at that point because you</text>
  <text start="349.159" dur="4.65">have to remember once the puppet</text>
  <text start="351.499" dur="4.53">government is in place all those people</text>
  <text start="353.809" dur="4.02">who oppose the government they are the</text>
  <text start="356.029" dur="4.41">terrorists they call them al Qaeda the</text>
  <text start="357.829" dur="4.11">Islamic state in a country where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="360.439" dur="4.08">trying to remove the government and</text>
  <text start="361.939" dur="4.921">replace it with a pub government they</text>
  <text start="364.519" dur="6.031">use their proxy army and they call it</text>
  <text start="366.86" dur="7.679">the Islamic state al Qaeda and they call</text>
  <text start="370.55" dur="7.079">it terror so they use it in both ways</text>
  <text start="374.539" dur="5.4">because remember the legislation that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="377.629" dur="4.53">in Congress that was passed back in two</text>
  <text start="379.939" dur="4.861">thousand one allows the United States to</text>
  <text start="382.159" dur="6.48">go after al Qaeda in any country in the</text>
  <text start="384.8" dur="6.389">Middle East they&amp;#39;re trying to amend this</text>
  <text start="388.639" dur="5.13">and make it the Islamic state Boko Haram</text>
  <text start="391.189" dur="5.88">or any other terrorist organization but</text>
  <text start="393.769" dur="7.44">that legislation has not passed out in</text>
  <text start="397.069" dur="6.39">Yemen we see a watchdog a human rights</text>
  <text start="401.209" dur="4.47">watchdog is saying that the United</text>
  <text start="403.459" dur="4.17">States should stop selling arms to Saudi</text>
  <text start="405.679" dur="3.99">Arabia because they could be held</text>
  <text start="407.629" dur="3.9">accountable for the war crimes committed</text>
  <text start="409.669" dur="5.55">in Yemen because they&amp;#39;re selling them</text>
  <text start="411.529" dur="7.5">cluster bombs and the Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="415.219" dur="7.23">mercenary army used to be black water</text>
  <text start="419.029" dur="5.75">now it&amp;#39;s Dinah Corp they&amp;#39;re hitting</text>
  <text start="422.449" dur="4.47">infrastructure killing women children</text>
  <text start="424.779" dur="4.09">they&amp;#39;re trying to make the people suffer</text>
  <text start="426.919" dur="5.37">once again to accept the puppet</text>
  <text start="428.869" dur="4.98">government and we know that</text>
  <text start="432.289" dur="3.84">United States is orchestrating this</text>
  <text start="433.849" dur="5.511">entire thing they&amp;#39;re orchestrating</text>
  <text start="436.129" dur="6.96">everything in the Middle East remember</text>
  <text start="439.36" dur="7.299">all of this is dependent on the petro</text>
  <text start="443.089" dur="6.741">dollar that&amp;#39;s the only reason the u.s.</text>
  <text start="446.659" dur="6.78">is their oil and the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="449.83" dur="4.899">because they want their system to</text>
  <text start="453.439" dur="3.241">continue because they make a lot of</text>
  <text start="454.729" dur="3.99">money on this system now the people</text>
  <text start="456.68" dur="4.889">suffer on this system because the</text>
  <text start="458.719" dur="5.7">central bank&amp;#39;s their system always</text>
  <text start="461.569" dur="5.611">fizzles and dies out and it always</text>
  <text start="464.419" dur="5.31">leaves the people in debt and those</text>
  <text start="467.18" dur="4.919">people at the top always make out like</text>
  <text start="469.729" dur="4.41">bandits and they love this system and</text>
  <text start="472.099" dur="4.74">they like to restart it once it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="474.139" dur="3.78">completely destroyed and done with but</text>
  <text start="476.839" dur="2.97">they want to blame it on someone else</text>
  <text start="477.919" dur="5.131">they so they can restart the entire</text>
  <text start="479.809" dur="5.431">system once again now Russia has</text>
  <text start="483.05" dur="4.859">temporarily banned imports of Turkish</text>
  <text start="485.24" dur="4.169">pepper and pomegranates and we can see</text>
  <text start="487.909" dur="4.141">they&amp;#39;re continually with different</text>
  <text start="489.409" dur="6.451">sanctions and banning certain products</text>
  <text start="492.05" dur="8.659">from Turkey remember they shot down a</text>
  <text start="495.86" dur="4.849">Russian jet trying to provoke a war and</text>
  <text start="500.86" dur="5.579">Victoria Nuland this is the Secretary of</text>
  <text start="504.409" dur="4.38">State for European and Eurasian affairs</text>
  <text start="506.439" dur="4.75">said it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what Russia does</text>
  <text start="508.789" dur="5.3">so what they pulled out some of the</text>
  <text start="511.189" dur="7.741">military in Syria it makes no difference</text>
  <text start="514.089" dur="8.62">these sanctions stand because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="518.93" dur="6.54">still in Ukraine they still have forces</text>
  <text start="522.709" dur="5.551">on the border and they&amp;#39;re still causing</text>
  <text start="525.47" dur="5.97">problems in Ukraine so the sanctions</text>
  <text start="528.26" dur="6.36">stay because they didn&amp;#39;t let us have our</text>
  <text start="531.44" dur="5.459">way with our coup d&amp;#39;etat and we know</text>
  <text start="534.62" dur="6.329">that was funded by George Soros we know</text>
  <text start="536.899" dur="8.55">she was basically the conductor of the</text>
  <text start="540.949" dur="7.611">entire thing and we know from Open Skies</text>
  <text start="545.449" dur="7.351">treaty Ukraine Germany the United States</text>
  <text start="548.56" dur="8.37">turkey flew over Russia on the border</text>
  <text start="552.8" dur="7.32">and they&amp;#39;ve never found troop build-up</text>
  <text start="556.93" dur="5.95">actually an NBC I think was an NBC crew</text>
  <text start="560.12" dur="5.42">that drove 1200 miles up and down the</text>
  <text start="562.88" dur="7.16">border and they could not find</text>
  <text start="565.54" dur="6.719">on the border whatsoever nonexistent so</text>
  <text start="570.04" dur="4.53">all of this is made up and during this</text>
  <text start="572.259" dur="4.351">whole crisis they continually say</text>
  <text start="574.57" dur="4.439">Russians invading Russia&amp;#39;s invading and</text>
  <text start="576.61" dur="4.169">you know they had satellites you know</text>
  <text start="579.009" dur="5.221">their full color 3d but they never</text>
  <text start="580.779" dur="5.75">showed the satellite images remember the</text>
  <text start="584.23" dur="4.529">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="586.529" dur="4.691">every time they come out with a</text>
  <text start="588.759" dur="6.45">statement they&amp;#39;re the ones who have to</text>
  <text start="591.22" dur="6.599">prove what they&amp;#39;re saying they need to</text>
  <text start="595.209" dur="4.831">prove it to the United stupi Belov the</text>
  <text start="597.819" dur="6.151">United States if they say someone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="600.04" dur="6.39">invading well prove it if they say we</text>
  <text start="603.97" dur="6.359">need to go into Syria because Assad used</text>
  <text start="606.43" dur="5.639">sarin gas well prove it well we know</text>
  <text start="610.329" dur="4.26">that Obama just came out and said well</text>
  <text start="612.069" dur="4.291">our intelligence wasn&amp;#39;t really clear we</text>
  <text start="614.589" dur="4.381">really didn&amp;#39;t know it wasn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="616.36" dur="4.14">specific that it was Assad so it was</text>
  <text start="618.97" dur="4.429">faulty intelligence and they were going</text>
  <text start="620.5" dur="7.11">to bring us all to war at that point and</text>
  <text start="623.399" dur="7.361">here we are three years later we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="627.61" dur="6.539">still in the same spot nothing has</text>
  <text start="630.76" dur="6.75">changed they&amp;#39;re still doing the same</text>
  <text start="634.149" dur="7.56">thing going after the same goal now</text>
  <text start="637.51" dur="8.46">during the peace talks in Syria we see</text>
  <text start="641.709" dur="5.671">that they&amp;#39;re trying to bring up what has</text>
  <text start="645.97" dur="3.89">happened in there and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="647.38" dur="5.67">there&amp;#39;s a lot of war crimes especially</text>
  <text start="649.86" dur="6.37">from the Syrian government side Assad</text>
  <text start="653.05" dur="6.029">and we know they brought pictures to</text>
  <text start="656.23" dur="5.039">Congress and this guy Caesar which is</text>
  <text start="659.079" dur="3.99">his codename presented the pictures and</text>
  <text start="661.269" dur="3.81">then we&amp;#39;ve come to find out which we</text>
  <text start="663.069" dur="4.411">knew all along which we reported on that</text>
  <text start="665.079" dur="4.971">all those pictures are absolutely</text>
  <text start="667.48" dur="5.37">meaningless there is no link to Assad</text>
  <text start="670.05" dur="6.25">actually there are links to the rebels</text>
  <text start="672.85" dur="7.109">and the Islamic state and it turns out</text>
  <text start="676.3" dur="6.269">that none of these pictures shows the</text>
  <text start="679.959" dur="4.5">government of Syria doing anything it</text>
  <text start="682.569" dur="4.26">shows the aftermath it&amp;#39;s like a murder</text>
  <text start="684.459" dur="4.291">if someone shows a photograph of a</text>
  <text start="686.829" dur="5.25">murder on your on a murder trial and say</text>
  <text start="688.75" dur="5.13">see here&amp;#39;s the dead body that person did</text>
  <text start="692.079" dur="3.931">it that&amp;#39;s not the link that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="693.88" dur="4.62">aftermath and that&amp;#39;s all the US</text>
  <text start="696.01" dur="3.75">government does they never have proof</text>
  <text start="698.5" dur="4.74">but during the P</text>
  <text start="699.76" dur="9.33">talks here we see that the UN Human</text>
  <text start="703.24" dur="8.7">Rights Council is saying that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="709.09" dur="5.88">peace talks must include justice for</text>
  <text start="711.94" dur="5.94">victims now they&amp;#39;re trying to push this</text>
  <text start="714.97" dur="6.65">off on to Assad and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="717.88" dur="6.75">bring up war crimes against Assad and</text>
  <text start="721.62" dur="4.96">this is not part of the agenda because</text>
  <text start="724.63" dur="5.1">there&amp;#39;s no proof but they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="726.58" dur="5.01">bring this up once again and we can see</text>
  <text start="729.73" dur="4.32">they continually do the same things over</text>
  <text start="731.59" dur="5.01">and over they tell us about barrel bombs</text>
  <text start="734.05" dur="4.8">they taught tell us about the chemical</text>
  <text start="736.6" dur="5.34">weapons attacks they tell us oh look at</text>
  <text start="738.85" dur="5.81">the pictures from Caesar and all of it</text>
  <text start="741.94" dur="6.24">turns out to be fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="744.66" dur="7.84">because this is all they have they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="748.18" dur="5.76">have any proof of anything and most of</text>
  <text start="752.5" dur="4.19">the proof now that we&amp;#39;re finding out</text>
  <text start="753.94" dur="5.88">which we knew back then but it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="756.69" dur="6.91">cooperated that it was the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="759.82" dur="6.27">it was the rebels it was Al nusrah al</text>
  <text start="763.6" dur="4.26">Qaeda it was all these terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="766.09" dur="4.79">that were doing all these things because</text>
  <text start="767.86" dur="7.35">it makes no sense why would a president</text>
  <text start="770.88" dur="9.13">fighting for his country attack his own</text>
  <text start="775.21" dur="8.22">people it makes no sense going back to</text>
  <text start="780.01" dur="5.28">the Revolutionary War it would be like</text>
  <text start="783.43" dur="5.85">George Washington turning around and</text>
  <text start="785.29" dur="5.64">shooting the cannons at civilians it</text>
  <text start="789.28" dur="4.8">makes no sense and then asking those</text>
  <text start="790.93" dur="5.97">civilians please in the elections vote</text>
  <text start="794.08" dur="5.64">for me well that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="796.9" dur="6.03">to say out in Syria and we know back in</text>
  <text start="799.72" dur="4.8">2014 when the elections occurred he</text>
  <text start="802.93" dur="4.61">received eighty-seven percent of the</text>
  <text start="804.52" dur="7.53">vote and yes they were monitored</text>
  <text start="807.54" dur="6.13">elections and the US knew this was going</text>
  <text start="812.05" dur="3.81">to be a problem and this is why all of a</text>
  <text start="813.67" dur="4.65">sudden about three weeks after the</text>
  <text start="815.86" dur="8.52">elections the Islamic state appeared out</text>
  <text start="818.32" dur="9.09">of nowhere so the rebels right now their</text>
  <text start="824.38" dur="5.01">morale is sky-high because now they say</text>
  <text start="827.41" dur="4.11">they can have a military victory because</text>
  <text start="829.39" dur="3.51">Russia is leaving well they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="831.52" dur="2.12">really pulled out they pulled out some</text>
  <text start="832.9" dur="3.35">of the troops</text>
  <text start="833.64" dur="3.84">but they&amp;#39;re still bombing the Islamic</text>
  <text start="836.25" dur="3.09">state and we know a lot of the Islamic</text>
  <text start="837.48" dur="3.51">state al Qaeda al nusrah has been</text>
  <text start="839.34" dur="4.32">morphing into the Free Syrian Army</text>
  <text start="840.99" dur="5.7">before they didn&amp;#39;t exist because they</text>
  <text start="843.66" dur="4.83">switch them back and forth because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="846.69" dur="2.82">a lot easier to say hey it&amp;#39;s a terrorist</text>
  <text start="848.49" dur="5.99">group had nothing to do with our</text>
  <text start="849.51" dur="4.97">moderates now remember this whole entire</text>
  <text start="854.57" dur="8.11">battle for Syria was a deal made with</text>
  <text start="859.08" dur="5.94">Saudi Arabia Israel and the other Middle</text>
  <text start="862.68" dur="5.66">Eastern countries because it has to do</text>
  <text start="865.02" dur="7.14">with oil gas and the petro dollar and</text>
  <text start="868.34" dur="8.11">eventually getting into a ram so they</text>
  <text start="872.16" dur="8.25">started out by lowering the price of oil</text>
  <text start="876.45" dur="6.03">by Saudi Arabia producing a huge amount</text>
  <text start="880.41" dur="7.02">of oil and making it very cheap to put</text>
  <text start="882.48" dur="8.34">pressure on Russia and Iran and the u.s.</text>
  <text start="887.43" dur="7.29">Saudi oil price manipulation was aimed</text>
  <text start="890.82" dur="7.2">at destabilizing the opponents of the US</text>
  <text start="894.72" dur="5.16">globalist policies and we see at this</text>
  <text start="898.02" dur="4.41">point they&amp;#39;re continually doing this</text>
  <text start="899.88" dur="7.62">because it once worked with the Soviet</text>
  <text start="902.43" dur="8.58">Union and this time it&amp;#39;s not working at</text>
  <text start="907.5" dur="5.91">all because what happened was Russia has</text>
  <text start="911.01" dur="5.31">taken strategic steps with China and</text>
  <text start="913.41" dur="6.06">other nations to lessen its dependency</text>
  <text start="916.32" dur="5.46">on the West in fact the oil weapon is</text>
  <text start="919.47" dur="4.17">accelerating recent Russian moves to</text>
  <text start="921.78" dur="3.96">focus its economic power on national</text>
  <text start="923.64" dur="8.46">interest and lessen dependence on the</text>
  <text start="925.74" dur="8.22">dollar system so we see this deal to</text>
  <text start="932.1" dur="6.09">destroy Russia through this entire</text>
  <text start="933.96" dur="6.78">system is not going as planned now</text>
  <text start="938.19" dur="6.78">remember they want to build a pipeline</text>
  <text start="940.74" dur="7.35">through Syria and back in July of 2011</text>
  <text start="944.97" dur="5.25">the government of Syria Iran and Iraq</text>
  <text start="948.09" dur="5.82">sign and historic gas pipeline energy</text>
  <text start="950.22" dur="9.63">agreement which many people didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="953.91" dur="8.76">about and at this point the pipeline</text>
  <text start="959.85" dur="5.1">that they wanted to build is going to</text>
  <text start="962.67" dur="4.35">cost about 10 billion and take three</text>
  <text start="964.95" dur="4.68">years to complete and</text>
  <text start="967.02" dur="4.68">would run from the Iranian port near the</text>
  <text start="969.63" dur="4.29">south pars gas field and the Persian</text>
  <text start="971.7" dur="5.07">Gulf to Damascus in Syria via Iraq</text>
  <text start="973.92" dur="6.66">territory the agreement would make Siri</text>
  <text start="976.77" dur="6.38">the center of assembly and production in</text>
  <text start="980.58" dur="6.57">conjunction with reserves of Lebanon</text>
  <text start="983.15" dur="6.79">this is a geopolitically strategic space</text>
  <text start="987.15" dur="5.91">and geographically opens the first time</text>
  <text start="989.94" dur="6.15">extending from Iran to Iraq Syria and</text>
  <text start="993.06" dur="7.37">Lebanon and right after they signed this</text>
  <text start="996.09" dur="9.77">agreement in August sixteenth of 2011</text>
  <text start="1000.43" dur="8.59">they found a huge amount of gas in the</text>
  <text start="1005.86" dur="7">central region of Syria near homes and</text>
  <text start="1009.02" dur="6.66">gas prom with Assad in power would be a</text>
  <text start="1012.86" dur="8.61">major investor or operator of the new</text>
  <text start="1015.68" dur="12.5">gas field in Syria and Washington saw</text>
  <text start="1021.47" dur="6.71">this and said well this cannot happen</text>
  <text start="1028.3" dur="6.46">because it was Lao Syria to control the</text>
  <text start="1032.54" dur="7.22">Middle East it would be a gateway to</text>
  <text start="1034.76" dur="7.11">Asia and to China via the Silk Road and</text>
  <text start="1039.76" dur="5.97">they could not let this happen because</text>
  <text start="1041.87" dur="7.35">guitar they want to build a gas pipeline</text>
  <text start="1045.73" dur="9.13">through Syria into Europe and they want</text>
  <text start="1049.22" dur="8.49">to do the same thing and this is why we</text>
  <text start="1054.86" dur="5.97">are doing this because Syria holds the</text>
  <text start="1057.71" dur="5.28">key to all of this and this is why the</text>
  <text start="1060.83" dur="7.02">u.s. is there because of the petro</text>
  <text start="1062.99" dur="7.22">dollar because of gas oil pipelines has</text>
  <text start="1067.85" dur="5.58">nothing to do with freedom democracy and</text>
  <text start="1070.21" dur="6.82">uprising because these mean or anything</text>
  <text start="1073.43" dur="7.95">like that it has to do with their system</text>
  <text start="1077.03" dur="8.13">that is it now we see the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="1081.38" dur="5.73">putting their plans into gear we see the</text>
  <text start="1085.16" dur="4.98">Syrian Kurds have announced a federal</text>
  <text start="1087.11" dur="4.76">system in northern Syria the Kurdish</text>
  <text start="1090.14" dur="4.43">controlled areas of northern Syria are</text>
  <text start="1091.87" dur="4.75">expected to declare a federal system</text>
  <text start="1094.57" dur="3.64">taking matters into their own hands</text>
  <text start="1096.62" dur="3.52">remember they weren&amp;#39;t included in the</text>
  <text start="1098.21" dur="4.63">Geneva talks</text>
  <text start="1100.14" dur="6.3">and we see that the u.s. is kind of in a</text>
  <text start="1102.84" dur="6.72">corner right now because how do they</text>
  <text start="1106.44" dur="6.06">explain away that the Kurds want an</text>
  <text start="1109.56" dur="4.98">autonomous region when they objected to</text>
  <text start="1112.5" dur="4.53">Crimea and the southeastern people in</text>
  <text start="1114.54" dur="5.1">Ukraine doing this this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="1117.03" dur="3.96">major problem now the Syrian Kurds</text>
  <text start="1119.64" dur="4.76">effectively control a stretch of about</text>
  <text start="1120.99" dur="7.74">400 kilometers 250 miles along the</text>
  <text start="1124.4" dur="6.37">syrian-turkish border and they also</text>
  <text start="1128.73" dur="5.69">control sections of the Northwest border</text>
  <text start="1130.77" dur="7.05">in the afrin area now they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="1134.42" dur="5.32">because this is part of the USS plan now</text>
  <text start="1137.82" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re going to say oh no we we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1139.74" dur="6.06">want this to happen we don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1142.68" dur="5.13">split up Syria or Iraq or anything else</text>
  <text start="1145.8" dur="5.9">but we know this is all part of their</text>
  <text start="1147.81" dur="5.97">plan and we see at this point that</text>
  <text start="1151.7" dur="6.01">they&amp;#39;re going to be pushing this plan</text>
  <text start="1153.78" dur="6.84">forward and we know that there&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1157.71" dur="4.8">military drills we know that military</text>
  <text start="1160.62" dur="3.87">assets are in place we know NATO has</text>
  <text start="1162.51" dur="6.96">their ships Germany has their ships UK</text>
  <text start="1164.49" dur="7.2">has their ships in the Aegean Sea we</text>
  <text start="1169.47" dur="4.89">know the Middle Eastern countries Saudi</text>
  <text start="1171.69" dur="4.02">Arabia Turkey the US and all the other</text>
  <text start="1174.36" dur="3.99">coalition forces have brought in</text>
  <text start="1175.71" dur="4.64">military assets and troops preparing and</text>
  <text start="1178.35" dur="5.52">getting ready for something big</text>
  <text start="1180.35" dur="8.95">President Obama will travel to Saudi</text>
  <text start="1183.87" dur="9">Arabia in April to meet with the Gulf</text>
  <text start="1189.3" dur="7.74">nations to discuss the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1192.87" dur="7.65">midi security concerns and other things</text>
  <text start="1197.04" dur="8.16">and we can see at this point that</text>
  <text start="1200.52" dur="7.62">everything is building up for this major</text>
  <text start="1205.2" dur="4.59">event now a lot of people are saying</text>
  <text start="1208.14" dur="4.56">that this is going to happen in April</text>
  <text start="1209.79" dur="5.28">and May we know there&amp;#39;s elections in</text>
  <text start="1212.7" dur="4.05">Syria in April parliamentary elections</text>
  <text start="1215.07" dur="4.92">we know the peace talks are going on</text>
  <text start="1216.75" dur="7.17">right now we know everything is set up</text>
  <text start="1219.99" dur="6.21">and positioned for this and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1223.92" dur="5.76">to have to watch and see how this</text>
  <text start="1226.2" dur="6.21">unfolds because we know the goal is</text>
  <text start="1229.68" dur="4.14">always the same and has not changed at</text>
  <text start="1232.41" dur="5.28">all</text>
  <text start="1233.82" dur="6.69">going back five six years they just keep</text>
  <text start="1237.69" dur="7.02">on coming up with new plans going after</text>
  <text start="1240.51" dur="7.08">the same thing now military experts</text>
  <text start="1244.71" dur="5.1">right now say the US needs to prepare</text>
  <text start="1247.59" dur="4.92">for satellite attacks are saying China</text>
  <text start="1249.81" dur="5.42">and Russia they&amp;#39;re preparing to attack</text>
  <text start="1252.51" dur="5.82">us intelligence and military satellites</text>
  <text start="1255.23" dur="7.33">now we know they&amp;#39;re in Congress right</text>
  <text start="1258.33" dur="5.76">now because they want more money they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1262.56" dur="4.41">saying their adversaries are development</text>
  <text start="1264.09" dur="4.98">kinetic directed energy and cyber tues</text>
  <text start="1266.97" dur="4.38">to deny degrade and destroy our space</text>
  <text start="1269.07" dur="6.15">capabilities this is coming from General</text>
  <text start="1271.35" dur="5.88">John heightened and you know what</text>
  <text start="1275.22" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re saying is please give us more</text>
  <text start="1277.23" dur="6.8">money we need to scare you into giving</text>
  <text start="1280.26" dur="7.47">us more money why would Russia and China</text>
  <text start="1284.03" dur="5.53">hit the satellites at this point yes</text>
  <text start="1287.73" dur="4.14">maybe after the United States provokes</text>
  <text start="1289.56" dur="4.59">them into war and they start World War</text>
  <text start="1291.87" dur="4.2">three they might try hitting the</text>
  <text start="1294.15" dur="5.34">satellites but if they start hitting the</text>
  <text start="1296.07" dur="5.46">satellites in space it blows the</text>
  <text start="1299.49" dur="3.6">satellites up there&amp;#39;s pieces floating</text>
  <text start="1301.53" dur="3.63">everywhere those pieces could fly into</text>
  <text start="1303.09" dur="4.26">their satellites so at this point it</text>
  <text start="1305.16" dur="4.5">makes no sense for them to do this so</text>
  <text start="1307.35" dur="5.58">what they&amp;#39;re doing at this point is</text>
  <text start="1309.66" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re scaring people because they know</text>
  <text start="1312.93" dur="4.08">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="1314.67" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re going to continually provoke and</text>
  <text start="1317.01" dur="5.73">provoke these countries until they get a</text>
  <text start="1320.58" dur="6.08">war started and if you notice they need</text>
  <text start="1322.74" dur="7.11">this fear to fund the military complex</text>
  <text start="1326.66" dur="6.19">to get more funding of course a lot of</text>
  <text start="1329.85" dur="5.1">funding disappears but they need it to</text>
  <text start="1332.85" dur="4.77">build up the forces because they know</text>
  <text start="1334.95" dur="7.26">eventually they&amp;#39;re going to be pushing</text>
  <text start="1337.62" dur="9.18">war because they need to cover up this</text>
  <text start="1342.21" dur="6.39">entire collapse of the system listen</text>
