  <text start="101.68" dur="4.56">financial news now we talked about the</text>
  <text start="104.35" dur="3.32">liquidity crisis that is occurring in</text>
  <text start="106.24" dur="4.35">Europe where there&amp;#39;s a shortage of</text>
  <text start="107.67" dur="4.839">dollars and this is going to continue</text>
  <text start="110.59" dur="3.36">about it&amp;#39;s very interesting is that here</text>
  <text start="112.509" dur="3.36">in United States there is a paper that</text>
  <text start="113.95" dur="3.96">came out that was just released by the</text>
  <text start="115.869" dur="5.101">Brookings Institution and this has to do</text>
  <text start="117.91" dur="6.93">with the looming mortgage liquidity</text>
  <text start="120.97" dur="6.319">crisis now when they looked at this they</text>
  <text start="124.84" dur="4.949">saw that non-bank mortgage companies are</text>
  <text start="127.289" dur="3.791">vulnerable to liquidity pressures in</text>
  <text start="129.789" dur="4.651">both their loan origination and</text>
  <text start="131.08" dur="6.18">servicing activities now what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="134.44" dur="5.34">saying is that there&amp;#39;s about almost 2/3</text>
  <text start="137.26" dur="5.28">of Ginnie Mae guaranteed securities</text>
  <text start="139.78" dur="4.83">which are issued by independent mortgage</text>
  <text start="142.54" dur="4.169">banks and these independent mortgage</text>
  <text start="144.61" dur="5.19">bankers are using some of the same</text>
  <text start="146.709" dur="5.671">tricks that they used in the past and</text>
  <text start="149.8" dur="4.35">this is going to be a problem as we move</text>
  <text start="152.38" dur="3.93">forward now what they&amp;#39;re saying is that</text>
  <text start="154.15" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;ve been very lucky up to this point</text>
  <text start="156.31" dur="5.1">why because the economy well it hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="159.19" dur="4.83">fallen into recession and mortgage</text>
  <text start="161.41" dur="4.74">delinquencies they haven&amp;#39;t increased the</text>
  <text start="164.02" dur="3.87">way they have in 2008 but they are</text>
  <text start="166.15" dur="5.27">moving up now</text>
  <text start="167.89" dur="5.67">the thing is we are in a recession even</text>
  <text start="171.42" dur="3.31">though they manipulate all these numbers</text>
  <text start="173.56" dur="2.819">and the government to come out and tell</text>
  <text start="174.73" dur="2.88">us we&amp;#39;re in a recession doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="176.379" dur="3.571">we&amp;#39;re not in a recession because what</text>
  <text start="177.61" dur="5.4">they normally do is they go back in time</text>
  <text start="179.95" dur="4.8">and they tell you oh this is when it</text>
  <text start="183.01" dur="3.66">really started the same thing is going</text>
  <text start="184.75" dur="4.74">to happen this time so</text>
  <text start="186.67" dur="3.75">this really means is we&amp;#39;re in a lot of</text>
  <text start="189.49" dur="3.6">trouble right now</text>
  <text start="190.42" dur="4.89">now naan baked mortgage providers</text>
  <text start="193.09" dur="5.61">essentially borrow short and lend long</text>
  <text start="195.31" dur="6.66">using warehouse lines of credit from</text>
  <text start="198.7" dur="5.91">banks to fund mortgages from 2012 to the</text>
  <text start="201.97" dur="4.32">third quarter of 2017 commitments on</text>
  <text start="204.61" dur="4.89">warehouse lines has increased seventy</text>
  <text start="206.29" dur="5.61">percent of course if it all goes well a</text>
  <text start="209.5" dur="4.56">mortgage will be sold quickly into the</text>
  <text start="211.9" dur="4.71">secondary market and the line will be</text>
  <text start="214.06" dur="5.009">reduced now if things don&amp;#39;t go well like</text>
  <text start="216.61" dur="5.129">they did in 2008 we&amp;#39;re in trouble</text>
  <text start="219.069" dur="4.711">what can go wrong well the Brookings</text>
  <text start="221.739" dur="6.03">authors identified three vulnerabilities</text>
  <text start="223.78" dur="8.31">in the process number one margin calls</text>
  <text start="227.769" dur="6.481">due to aging risk example the time it</text>
  <text start="232.09" dur="4.11">takes the non-bank to sell the loans to</text>
  <text start="234.25" dur="4.04">a mortgage investor and repurchase the</text>
  <text start="236.2" dur="4.74">collateral and/or mark-to-market</text>
  <text start="238.29" dur="5.8">devaluations number two rollover risk</text>
  <text start="240.94" dur="5.82">number three covenant violations leading</text>
  <text start="244.09" dur="6.27">to cancellations of the lines now these</text>
  <text start="246.76" dur="7.02">vulnerabilities are very real should</text>
  <text start="250.36" dur="6.21">there be a sudden increase in interest</text>
  <text start="253.78" dur="6.63">rates or other significant change in the</text>
  <text start="256.57" dur="7.86">market well that means that the</text>
  <text start="260.41" dur="6.15">collateral values will drop that means</text>
  <text start="264.43" dur="3.93">we will be in trouble now mortgage</text>
  <text start="266.56" dur="3.57">servicers have liquidity issues because</text>
  <text start="268.36" dur="4.29">they required to continue making</text>
  <text start="270.13" dur="5.07">payments to investors tax authorities</text>
  <text start="272.65" dur="4.019">and insurers if mortgage borrowers quit</text>
  <text start="275.2" dur="4.68">making payments so they still have to</text>
  <text start="276.669" dur="7.381">make payments and we can see that once</text>
  <text start="279.88" dur="7.53">this system crashes and the clock is</text>
  <text start="284.05" dur="6.51">ticking well we&amp;#39;re gonna have a major</text>
  <text start="287.41" dur="4.08">problem in this area and it&amp;#39;s looming</text>
  <text start="290.56" dur="3.54">we&amp;#39;re right it&amp;#39;s right on the horizon</text>
  <text start="291.49" dur="4.739">here just like liquidity crisis in</text>
  <text start="294.1" dur="3.51">Europe I mean think about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="296.229" dur="3.841">happening here we&amp;#39;re seeing indicator</text>
  <text start="297.61" dur="5.309">after indicator showing that if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="300.07" dur="5.34">one little hiccup all of this completely</text>
  <text start="302.919" dur="5.281">comes down now what else are we seeing</text>
  <text start="305.41" dur="5.009">well it looks like we have a problem in</text>
  <text start="308.2" dur="4.38">the subprime market once again now the</text>
  <text start="310.419" dur="4.381">Financial Times they&amp;#39;re reporting that</text>
  <text start="312.58" dur="5.01">not only are subprime mortgage-backed</text>
  <text start="314.8" dur="5.7">securities becoming prominent again but</text>
  <text start="317.59" dur="6.3">that the Chase for yield was what</text>
  <text start="320.5" dur="6.21">fueling the demand and it&amp;#39;s like deja vu</text>
  <text start="323.89" dur="5.79">all over again because what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="326.71" dur="5.49">is that mortgage originators real estate</text>
  <text start="329.68" dur="5.97">investors they&amp;#39;re doing the same exact</text>
  <text start="332.2" dur="6.54">thing that they were doing in 2006-2007</text>
  <text start="335.65" dur="6">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that mortgage</text>
  <text start="338.74" dur="5.1">levels are already almost back to 2008</text>
  <text start="341.65" dur="4.74">levels but don&amp;#39;t worry don&amp;#39;t worry the</text>
  <text start="343.84" dur="5.64">SMP says the risk is completely</text>
  <text start="346.39" dur="3.96">contained which we know it&amp;#39;s not it</text>
  <text start="349.48" dur="4.37">never is</text>
  <text start="350.35" dur="5.61">and we see that the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="353.85" dur="5.65">there&amp;#39;s nothing they can do at this</text>
  <text start="355.96" dur="5.22">point they have already created the</text>
  <text start="359.5" dur="3.57">stimulus they&amp;#39;ve already created the</text>
  <text start="361.18" dur="3.72">currency they&amp;#39;ve created all of this and</text>
  <text start="363.07" dur="3.56">when it comes crashing down it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="364.9" dur="4.5">to be a complete and utter disaster</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="5.05">we&amp;#39;re looking at every single indicator</text>
  <text start="369.4" dur="4.11">right now and every single indicator is</text>
  <text start="371.68" dur="3.84">pointing to a recession we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="373.51" dur="4.26">looking at the economy saying wow this</text>
  <text start="375.52" dur="4.29">looks like growth this looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="377.77" dur="4.02">improving the indicators are not</text>
  <text start="379.81" dur="4.05">pointing to that the indicators are</text>
  <text start="381.79" dur="3.54">pointing that we have pointing to that</text>
  <text start="383.86" dur="4.05">we have a major major problem</text>
  <text start="385.33" dur="4.71">in the economy and of course when it all</text>
  <text start="387.91" dur="4.71">falls apart that&amp;#39;s when everyone starts</text>
  <text start="390.04" dur="5.939">to realize what has really happened here</text>
  <text start="392.62" dur="5.82">yes they have the ability and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="395.979" dur="4.741">very good at it where they can keep the</text>
  <text start="398.44" dur="4.35">illusion alive up to the point where</text>
  <text start="400.72" dur="4.71">they don&amp;#39;t need to keep it alive anymore</text>
  <text start="402.79" dur="4.56">just like prior to 2008 all throughout</text>
  <text start="405.43" dur="4.86">that beer when they were going in to</text>
  <text start="407.35" dur="4.8">save Bear Stearns when they were putting</text>
  <text start="410.29" dur="3.81">up this fire putting out that fire</text>
  <text start="412.15" dur="4.41">telling you that this is contained</text>
  <text start="414.1" dur="5.01">telling you that there was no recession</text>
  <text start="416.56" dur="4.71">the markets not gonna crash and the</text>
  <text start="419.11" dur="4.26">whole thing came down in the same year</text>
  <text start="421.27" dur="4.44">they were telling them telling us that</text>
  <text start="423.37" dur="3.359">everything was fine the same things</text>
  <text start="425.71" dur="3.54">happening right now</text>
  <text start="426.729" dur="4.291">but now they&amp;#39;re just keeping the</text>
  <text start="429.25" dur="4.26">illusion completely hidden from the</text>
  <text start="431.02" dur="4.26">public and when it all comes down</text>
  <text start="433.51" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re gonna be pointing the finger</text>
  <text start="435.28" dur="4.98">someplace else when I say they it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="437.95" dur="4.71">central bank they never want to be</text>
  <text start="440.26" dur="4.44">blamed for what is a what happens in the</text>
  <text start="442.66" dur="4.23">economy they always blame some other</text>
  <text start="444.7" dur="3.6">entity of why this happened they come up</text>
  <text start="446.89" dur="3.209">with this other story like oh it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="448.3" dur="4.65">our fault it was because of this that</text>
  <text start="450.099" dur="4.381">and the other thing now we see that</text>
  <text start="452.95" dur="3.42">China</text>
  <text start="454.48" dur="6.93">they are definitely pushing their agenda</text>
  <text start="456.37" dur="7.05">with the petrohue on now just days after</text>
  <text start="461.41" dur="5.1">Beijing officially launched the yuan</text>
  <text start="463.42" dur="4.68">denominated crude oil futures and that</text>
  <text start="466.51" dur="4.26">seems to go printing it&amp;#39;s going pretty</text>
  <text start="468.1" dur="5.85">darn well here it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="470.77" dur="5.79">taking the next step a pilot program for</text>
  <text start="473.95" dur="4.47">you want payment could be launched as</text>
  <text start="476.56" dur="3.96">soon as the second half of the year and</text>
  <text start="478.42" dur="4.05">regulators have already asked some</text>
  <text start="480.52" dur="5.9">financial institutions to prepare for</text>
  <text start="482.47" dur="8.61">pricing crude imports in the U 1 now</text>
  <text start="486.42" dur="7">according to the proposed plan Bayesian</text>
  <text start="491.08" dur="5.19">would start with purchases from Russia</text>
  <text start="493.42" dur="5.28">and Angola two nations which like China</text>
  <text start="496.27" dur="5.16">are keen to break the dollars global</text>
  <text start="498.7" dur="5.1">dominance there are also two of the top</text>
  <text start="501.43" dur="4.4">suppliers of crude oil to China along</text>
  <text start="503.8" dur="6.15">with Saudi Arabia it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="505.83" dur="6.55">Saudi Arabia will be next and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="509.95" dur="4.44">waiting for that signal where Saudi</text>
  <text start="512.38" dur="5.34">Arabia says okay we&amp;#39;re gonna start</text>
  <text start="514.39" dur="7.11">selling part of our oil in the Petra you</text>
  <text start="517.72" dur="6.42">want once you start to hear this it is</text>
  <text start="521.5" dur="5.22">game over now there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="524.14" dur="5.1">change in the default crude oil</text>
  <text start="526.72" dur="5.4">transactional currency which for decades</text>
  <text start="529.24" dur="4.83">has been the petro dollar and if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.12" dur="4.83">a shift in just a small part of the</text>
  <text start="534.07" dur="6.63">global oil trade into the yuan well this</text>
  <text start="536.95" dur="6.57">is going to be huge because oil is the</text>
  <text start="540.7" dur="5.52">world&amp;#39;s most traded commodity with an</text>
  <text start="543.52" dur="5.37">annual trade value of around fourteen</text>
  <text start="546.22" dur="4.95">trillion roughly equivalent to China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="548.89" dur="4.71">gross domestic product currently</text>
  <text start="551.17" dur="4.71">virtually all global crude oil trading</text>
  <text start="553.6" dur="4.53">is in dollars and eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="555.88" dur="3.78">going to happen is countries are going</text>
  <text start="558.13" dur="6.3">to move away from the dollar and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="559.66" dur="7.86">gonna go into the u1 this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="564.43" dur="5.64">being pushed and pushed hard right now</text>
  <text start="567.52" dur="3.78">and of course the financial pundits and</text>
  <text start="570.07" dur="3">everyone&amp;#39;s out there saying no this is</text>
  <text start="571.3" dur="5.07">not going to do anything just like they</text>
  <text start="573.07" dur="5.25">said Oh China&amp;#39;s yuan will never be a</text>
  <text start="576.37" dur="5.46">reserve currency will never be added to</text>
  <text start="578.32" dur="4.98">the IMF the SDR basket we don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="581.83" dur="4.89">worry about that and here we are today</text>
  <text start="583.3" dur="4.94">when we look back over time yes it took</text>
  <text start="586.72" dur="4.07">years</text>
  <text start="588.24" dur="4.2">here we are today and when we think</text>
  <text start="590.79" dur="5.52">about it it happened very very quickly</text>
  <text start="592.44" dur="6.78">and all they need to do is to ramp this</text>
  <text start="596.31" dur="5.19">up very very slowly and what I mean by</text>
  <text start="599.22" dur="2.79">that is all they need to do is say okay</text>
  <text start="601.5" dur="2.97">you know what</text>
  <text start="602.01" dur="5.04">let&amp;#39;s take a portion of our oil sales</text>
  <text start="604.47" dur="4.59">let&amp;#39;s price it in petrol you wann will</text>
  <text start="607.05" dur="4.59">still hold dollars will still hold the</text>
  <text start="609.06" dur="6.029">petrol you wan now and we&amp;#39;ll do both and</text>
  <text start="611.64" dur="5.46">we&amp;#39;ll move the sliding scale over very</text>
  <text start="615.089" dur="3.991">very slowly we&amp;#39;ll do a little bit more</text>
  <text start="617.1" dur="3.57">petrol you want we&amp;#39;ll get a little bit</text>
  <text start="619.08" dur="3.259">more of the dollars remove that and</text>
  <text start="620.67" dur="4.71">before you know it</text>
  <text start="622.339" dur="4.87">Saudi Arabia the rest of the Middle</text>
  <text start="625.38" dur="5.519">Eastern countries they&amp;#39;re all using</text>
  <text start="627.209" dur="5.371">petrol you want and once they start to</text>
  <text start="630.899" dur="4.201">do this this becomes a very big deal</text>
  <text start="632.58" dur="5.4">even in the beginning stages it is a big</text>
  <text start="635.1" dur="5.609">deal because they don&amp;#39;t need to keep the</text>
  <text start="637.98" dur="4.56">dollars in reserve which means there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="640.709" dur="5.88">going to be a liquidity crisis in</text>
