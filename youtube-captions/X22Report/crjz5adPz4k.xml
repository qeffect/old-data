  <text start="111.61" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;ve been reporting on saying that</text>
  <text start="113.53" dur="3.75">the economy is doing well you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="114.79" dur="5.25">starting to realize that things are not</text>
  <text start="117.28" dur="4.98">going as well as they are saying we know</text>
  <text start="120.04" dur="5.16">they have been manipulating a lot of the</text>
  <text start="122.26" dur="6.06">data we know they massage a lot of the</text>
  <text start="125.2" dur="5.34">information to make us believe that</text>
  <text start="128.32" dur="4.229">everything is fine and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="130.54" dur="3.479">see this ramp up as we move further and</text>
  <text start="132.549" dur="3.151">further into this year because they need</text>
  <text start="134.019" dur="4.521">to convince everyone that everything is</text>
  <text start="135.7" dur="6.24">fine and they&amp;#39;re not going to stop now</text>
  <text start="138.54" dur="6.729">out in the eurozone we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="141.94" dur="7.59">see consumer confidence it fell in June</text>
  <text start="145.269" dur="6.451">it dropped to negative 7.3 from 7.0 back</text>
  <text start="149.53" dur="3.87">in May and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="151.72" dur="4.14">the people are saying you know something</text>
  <text start="153.4" dur="5.28">is wrong here and we know out in the</text>
  <text start="155.86" dur="4.65">European nations they do the same thing</text>
  <text start="158.68" dur="3.57">here in the United States the</text>
  <text start="160.51" dur="3.21">information the statistical information</text>
  <text start="162.25" dur="4.86">that they are presenting</text>
  <text start="163.72" dur="5.94">to everyone it is manipulated just like</text>
  <text start="167.11" dur="4.62">the United States those people who are</text>
  <text start="169.66" dur="4.17">sending out their resumes who want to</text>
  <text start="171.73" dur="4.23">get a job but just can&amp;#39;t find anything</text>
  <text start="173.83" dur="3.9">who are continually looking but haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="175.96" dur="4.26">been on an interview they&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="177.73" dur="5.01">counted they don&amp;#39;t want a job they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="180.22" dur="4.5">want work the same thing here in the</text>
  <text start="182.74" dur="4.29">United States there is no difference now</text>
  <text start="184.72" dur="5.09">sharp is out there and they are saying</text>
  <text start="187.03" dur="6.3">they&amp;#39;re going to be laying off about</text>
  <text start="189.81" dur="6.01">7,000 people globally yeah we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="193.33" dur="5.61">a lot of corporations lately coming up</text>
  <text start="195.82" dur="6.42">with these big layoff numbers now if the</text>
  <text start="198.94" dur="5.01">global economy is doing so well like the</text>
  <text start="202.24" dur="3.36">United States has been telling us the</text>
  <text start="203.95" dur="3.33">corporate media has been telling us</text>
  <text start="205.6" dur="6.96">they&amp;#39;re telling us that everything is</text>
  <text start="207.28" dur="8.58">fine why are these corporations laying</text>
  <text start="212.56" dur="5.399">off so many people because if the</text>
  <text start="215.86" dur="5.01">economy of the world of the private was</text>
  <text start="217.959" dur="6.531">in central bank countries if it is doing</text>
  <text start="220.87" dur="7.05">so well we would see an expansion of</text>
  <text start="224.49" dur="5.2">corporations of sales but we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="227.92" dur="3.9">the opposite and this is how we know the</text>
  <text start="229.69" dur="4.92">job numbers are fake this is how we know</text>
  <text start="231.82" dur="4.77">the economy the information they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="234.61" dur="4.05">feeding us is completely fake phony and</text>
  <text start="236.59" dur="4.619">false because it fits what is happening</text>
  <text start="238.66" dur="4.68">in the real economy stores are closing</text>
  <text start="241.209" dur="4.951">their contracting people are getting</text>
  <text start="243.34" dur="4.83">laid off gdp makes absolutely no sense</text>
  <text start="246.16" dur="4.26">whatsoever the service sector the</text>
  <text start="248.17" dur="4.56">manufacturing sector all in decline the</text>
  <text start="250.42" dur="6.09">Baltic Dry Index declining at the same</text>
  <text start="252.73" dur="5.759">time then they come out today and they</text>
  <text start="256.51" dur="4.5">want us to believe that existing home</text>
  <text start="258.489" dur="6.121">sales they&amp;#39;re the highest since februari</text>
  <text start="261.01" dur="5.88">of 2007 everyone should be worried at</text>
  <text start="264.61" dur="5.01">this point because what happened after</text>
  <text start="266.89" dur="5.55">2007 moving into 2008 yeah the whole</text>
  <text start="269.62" dur="4.71">economy came crashing down but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="272.44" dur="4.02">trying to convince us that everything is</text>
  <text start="274.33" dur="4.44">fine in home prices there are still</text>
  <text start="276.46" dur="6.33">appreciating everything is going well</text>
  <text start="278.77" dur="6.959">and home sales are really taking off and</text>
  <text start="282.79" dur="5.25">when we look at everything that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="285.729" dur="4.561">saying we see some interesting facts</text>
  <text start="288.04" dur="4.01">that really don&amp;#39;t make any sense first</text>
  <text start="290.29" dur="5.01">of all I looked around the country and</text>
  <text start="292.05" dur="4.66">except for those cities that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="295.3" dur="1.92">continually looking at saying that home</text>
  <text start="296.71" dur="2.58">prices are</text>
  <text start="297.22" dur="4.05">going up we look at the rest of the</text>
  <text start="299.29" dur="5.79">country you know the other hundred or so</text>
  <text start="301.27" dur="7.37">cities suburbs we are seeing that</text>
  <text start="305.08" dur="6.69">housing prices are actually fallen I</text>
  <text start="308.64" dur="4.39">have a lot of people riding into me from</text>
  <text start="311.77" dur="2.88">all parts of the country and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="313.03" dur="3.87">saying yes I&amp;#39;ve been trying to sell my</text>
  <text start="314.65" dur="5.34">house and I&amp;#39;ve lower it three times</text>
  <text start="316.9" dur="5.58">already I looked up in the north eastern</text>
  <text start="319.99" dur="4.62">western the northeastern section a</text>
  <text start="322.48" dur="5.94">little bit west from New York City and I</text>
  <text start="324.61" dur="6.24">see housing prices steady or if as you</text>
  <text start="328.42" dur="4.02">move further out they&amp;#39;re falling I look</text>
  <text start="330.85" dur="3.78">down in the south on the eastern</text>
  <text start="332.44" dur="4.17">seaboard I see the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="334.63" dur="5.01">houses on the market and guess what</text>
  <text start="336.61" dur="4.44">things are falling apart prices are</text>
  <text start="339.64" dur="4.65">continually coming down same thing in</text>
  <text start="341.05" dur="8.1">the south Midwest and the west and when</text>
  <text start="344.29" dur="8.1">we look at this we c f hf a they are</text>
  <text start="349.15" dur="6.42">telling us that home prices are dropping</text>
  <text start="352.39" dur="5.76">and then we have the national</text>
  <text start="355.57" dur="4.74">association of realtors they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="358.15" dur="6.5">that home prices are reaching record</text>
  <text start="360.31" dur="7.89">highs so we have conflicting information</text>
  <text start="364.65" dur="6.01">about what home prices are doing now</text>
  <text start="368.2" dur="5.31">remember the national association of</text>
  <text start="370.66" dur="4.38">realtors back in two thousand eight what</text>
  <text start="373.51" dur="3.45">did they tell us when the real estate</text>
  <text start="375.04" dur="5.85">market was crashing when the stock</text>
  <text start="376.96" dur="6.18">market just crashed yeah Larry yen was</text>
  <text start="380.89" dur="7.73">out there telling us during that winter</text>
  <text start="383.14" dur="9.87">of 2008 going into two thousand a nine</text>
  <text start="388.62" dur="6.76">housing is going to take off don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="393.01" dur="3.93">about it actually the Fed told us they</text>
  <text start="395.38" dur="6.9">weren&amp;#39;t even forecasting any type of</text>
  <text start="396.94" dur="7.71">recession in the same year it started so</text>
  <text start="402.28" dur="4.77">then we look at manhattan&amp;#39;s luxury real</text>
  <text start="404.65" dur="5.91">estate market and what are we saying</text>
  <text start="407.05" dur="6.63">well we have more evidence that the</text>
  <text start="410.56" dur="5.4">bubble is popping and people are getting</text>
  <text start="413.68" dur="4.44">out of the real estate market back in</text>
  <text start="415.96" dur="4.68">May we saw that people were lowering</text>
  <text start="418.12" dur="6.27">their prices by five percent come June</text>
  <text start="420.64" dur="6.87">it was six percent the middle of June</text>
  <text start="424.39" dur="6.33">right now it&amp;#39;s eleven percent they are</text>
  <text start="427.51" dur="3.51">cutting their price so what we can see</text>
  <text start="430.72" dur="2.84">at this</text>
  <text start="431.02" dur="4.799">point is that the real estate market</text>
  <text start="433.56" dur="4.359">we&amp;#39;re starting to see things come down</text>
  <text start="435.819" dur="4.021">we also mentioned couple reports ago</text>
  <text start="437.919" dur="3.571">about San Francisco so when we look at</text>
  <text start="439.84" dur="4.799">this entire economy what are we seeing</text>
  <text start="441.49" dur="5.88">we&amp;#39;re seeing a deterioration of what is</text>
  <text start="444.639" dur="4.5">going on they need to continually lie to</text>
  <text start="447.37" dur="4.979">us to convince us that everything is</text>
  <text start="449.139" dur="6.601">fine they&amp;#39;ll do this until the very end</text>
  <text start="452.349" dur="5.701">even when we&amp;#39;re in a recession going</text>
  <text start="455.74" dur="4.53">into this major collapse and everything</text>
  <text start="458.05" dur="3.69">is falling apart they still won&amp;#39;t admit</text>
  <text start="460.27" dur="3.869">it when I say they it&amp;#39;s the United</text>
  <text start="461.74" dur="5.669">States government central bankers now</text>
  <text start="464.139" dur="6.18">the IMF is out there and they are urging</text>
  <text start="467.409" dur="4.581">Obama to tackle poverty in the United</text>
  <text start="470.319" dur="4.621">States and of course according to Obama</text>
  <text start="471.99" dur="5.709">the economy is strong everyone has a job</text>
  <text start="474.94" dur="4.379">where at four point seven percent so we</text>
  <text start="477.699" dur="2.911">have a little bit of poverty here in the</text>
  <text start="479.319" dur="4.011">United States well actually the opposite</text>
  <text start="480.61" dur="6.26">is happening the entire country is</text>
  <text start="483.33" dur="6.1">dependent on government handouts I</text>
  <text start="486.87" dur="6.039">shouldn&amp;#39;t say the entire company the</text>
  <text start="489.43" dur="5.07">majority of the country right now a lot</text>
  <text start="492.909" dur="3.841">of people are on food stamps a lot of</text>
  <text start="494.5" dur="4.68">people are suffering we&amp;#39;re seeing more</text>
  <text start="496.75" dur="4.68">and more companies lay off people are</text>
  <text start="499.18" dur="5.37">having a very difficult time finding</text>
  <text start="501.43" dur="5.43">work I know just where I am I know four</text>
  <text start="504.55" dur="6.089">people already that got laid off and</text>
  <text start="506.86" dur="6.359">they&amp;#39;re looking for work someone in a</text>
  <text start="510.639" dur="6.421">tech company someone who is working in</text>
  <text start="513.219" dur="5.341">the health industry and they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="517.06" dur="2.969">work they&amp;#39;re continually trying to send</text>
  <text start="518.56" dur="4.169">out resumes but they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="520.029" dur="6.601">difficult time finding those businesses</text>
  <text start="522.729" dur="5.821">to send it to the IMF is also urging the</text>
  <text start="526.63" dur="3.99">u.s. to ratify that TPP as soon as</text>
  <text start="528.55" dur="3.51">possible well of course that will bring</text>
  <text start="530.62" dur="5.19">the United States into a third world</text>
  <text start="532.06" dur="6.66">country because parts of the TPP they</text>
  <text start="535.81" dur="4.89">allow foreign workers into United States</text>
  <text start="538.72" dur="4.14">and the corporations are allowed to pay</text>
  <text start="540.7" dur="4.62">them whatever the going rate is in their</text>
  <text start="542.86" dur="6.81">country which will not benefit the US</text>
  <text start="545.32" dur="6.99">employee we also know the TPP does not</text>
  <text start="549.67" dur="5.52">benefit the people it benefits the</text>
  <text start="552.31" dur="5.279">corporations and it will not help our</text>
  <text start="555.19" dur="5.79">country at all it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="557.589" dur="6.251">complete disaster if this passes we will</text>
  <text start="560.98" dur="6.91">see a loss of jobs</text>
  <text start="563.84" dur="6.69">the IMF has also downgraded the US</text>
  <text start="567.89" dur="5.7">economy now of course as we know the IMF</text>
  <text start="570.53" dur="4.86">predictions of gdp they&amp;#39;re never right</text>
  <text start="573.59" dur="4.37">there always off they&amp;#39;re always way too</text>
  <text start="575.39" dur="4.8">high and even if you cut them in half</text>
  <text start="577.96" dur="5.05">that&amp;#39;s not even where the GDP is going</text>
  <text start="580.19" dur="4.98">to be so right now the IMF is out there</text>
  <text start="583.01" dur="4.08">saying that instead of 2.4 which we</text>
  <text start="585.17" dur="4.02">predicted back in 2015 we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="587.09" dur="4.14">lower it to 2.2 at this point but we</text>
  <text start="589.19" dur="4.82">look at GDP numbers right now in the</text>
  <text start="591.23" dur="9.32">u.s. we&amp;#39;re not even close to that and</text>
  <text start="594.01" dur="10.47">it&amp;#39;s just getting worse we see the world</text>
  <text start="600.55" dur="6.91">central bankers they are gathered in</text>
  <text start="604.48" dur="5.17">Basel tower ahead of the brexit result</text>
  <text start="607.46" dur="5.76">now they&amp;#39;re on the 18th floor of the</text>
  <text start="609.65" dur="6.27">main tower and they&amp;#39;re discussing the</text>
  <text start="613.22" dur="5.75">global economy now they meet in secrecy</text>
  <text start="615.92" dur="5.79">there are no minutes that are kept and</text>
  <text start="618.97" dur="6.91">they&amp;#39;re discussing what their next move</text>
  <text start="621.71" dur="6.63">is now I can&amp;#39;t believe that every</text>
  <text start="625.88" dur="5.37">country and the people are satisfied</text>
  <text start="628.34" dur="4.29">with this where there are no minutes we</text>
  <text start="631.25" dur="4.17">don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re discussing and</text>
  <text start="632.63" dur="5.91">all of this is done from a private</text>
  <text start="635.42" dur="6.9">corporation the people have no say in</text>
  <text start="638.54" dur="6.78">what so ever why would anyone except as</text>
  <text start="642.32" dur="6.32">they are the root of all or I should say</text>
  <text start="645.32" dur="5.33">most of our problems get rid of that</text>
  <text start="648.64" dur="4.18">we&amp;#39;re going to see a completely</text>
  <text start="650.65" dur="5.23">different type of economy look at</text>
  <text start="652.82" dur="5.34">iceland they got rid of their bankers</text>
  <text start="655.88" dur="6.75">they took control of their central bank</text>
  <text start="658.16" dur="7.86">and their economy is booming but nobody</text>
