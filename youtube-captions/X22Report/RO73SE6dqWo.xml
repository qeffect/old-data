  <text start="118.45" dur="5.4">see this is not going to slow down</text>
  <text start="121.06" dur="5.76">whatsoever as the as the economy</text>
  <text start="123.85" dur="6.419">contracts as more and more people lose</text>
  <text start="126.82" dur="8.4">their jobs it&amp;#39;s going to get tougher and</text>
  <text start="130.269" dur="6.931">rougher so what is the u.s. doing what</text>
  <text start="135.22" dur="4.23">is the US government doing what is the</text>
  <text start="137.2" dur="4.44">central bank doing they&amp;#39;re making more</text>
  <text start="139.45" dur="5.429">that&amp;#39;s exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing and</text>
  <text start="141.64" dur="7.2">they&amp;#39;re trying to pass all the laws that</text>
  <text start="144.879" dur="7.411">benefit themselves and one of them is</text>
  <text start="148.84" dur="6.24">the TPP and this weekend we see that in</text>
  <text start="152.29" dur="4.68">Germany there is a huge protest about a</text>
  <text start="155.08" dur="6.72">quarter million Germans protested</text>
  <text start="156.97" dur="7.23">Obama&amp;#39;s free trade deal and we know that</text>
  <text start="161.8" dur="5.73">this trade deal because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="164.2" dur="5.28">kept a secret is not going to benefit</text>
  <text start="167.53" dur="5.039">the people but Obama is out there saying</text>
  <text start="169.48" dur="7.92">no everyone will be able to read this</text>
  <text start="172.569" dur="7.461">trade deal Congress and America they</text>
  <text start="177.4" dur="5.76">will have months to read every word as</text>
  <text start="180.03" dur="6.459">as soon as you get it across my desk and</text>
  <text start="183.16" dur="5.46">I sign it everybody can read it well</text>
  <text start="186.489" dur="4.171">wouldn&amp;#39;t it be better if Congress and</text>
  <text start="188.62" dur="5.16">the American people read it before it</text>
  <text start="190.66" dur="9.63">hit his desk before it was already</text>
  <text start="193.78" dur="9.06">passed in Congress because you know if</text>
  <text start="200.29" dur="4.919">we read this this would not go anywhere</text>
  <text start="202.84" dur="8.19">because this does not benefit the people</text>
  <text start="205.209" dur="9.81">whatsoever we see in Afghanistan the</text>
  <text start="211.03" dur="6.929">hospital that was hit in canoes well it</text>
  <text start="215.019" dur="6.651">looks like the US military aircraft that</text>
  <text start="217.959" dur="7.681">attacked the hospital made at least five</text>
  <text start="221.67" dur="6.099">passes over the hospital before dropping</text>
  <text start="225.64" dur="5.159">explosives now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="227.769" dur="6.03">about all of this on top of the roof of</text>
  <text start="230.799" dur="7.77">the hospital there were two flags draped</text>
  <text start="233.799" dur="8.28">across the roof and they indicated that</text>
  <text start="238.569" dur="6.181">this was a medical facility and it was</text>
  <text start="242.079" dur="4.081">Doctors Without Borders so doctors</text>
  <text start="244.75" dur="4.98">without borders are saying this was</text>
  <text start="246.16" dur="7.409">deliberately targeted because it was the</text>
  <text start="249.73" dur="5.49">only structure around the entire area if</text>
  <text start="253.569" dur="4.621">you look around the area there is</text>
  <text start="255.22" dur="4.5">nothing around the hospital so it was</text>
  <text start="258.19" dur="4.02">really the only target there and they</text>
  <text start="259.72" dur="5.15">knew that this was Doctors Without</text>
  <text start="262.21" dur="5.67">Borders it was a medical facility and</text>
  <text start="264.87" dur="5.38">they bombed it now the u.s. is saying</text>
  <text start="267.88" dur="5.42">okay we made a mistake a couple people</text>
  <text start="270.25" dur="7.38">died but it&amp;#39;s funny when other countries</text>
  <text start="273.3" dur="6.67">hit civilians they make a huge deal</text>
  <text start="277.63" dur="6.75">about it here they call it collateral</text>
  <text start="279.97" dur="6.27">damage and of course the other countries</text>
  <text start="284.38" dur="4.68">that are hitting civilians they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="286.24" dur="5.13">even prove it this was proved so now the</text>
  <text start="289.06" dur="6.479">u.s. is going to make payments to the</text>
  <text start="291.37" dur="6.66">families of the airstrike so they spent</text>
  <text start="295.539" dur="3.511">millions of dollars bombing the hospital</text>
  <text start="298.03" dur="2.76">and now they&amp;#39;re going to take millions</text>
  <text start="299.05" dur="3.03">of dollars to pay for the families but</text>
  <text start="300.79" dur="5.28">it doesn&amp;#39;t bring back their loved ones</text>
  <text start="302.08" dur="6.93">they are gone now we see there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="306.07" dur="5.76">company out there that created a new</text>
  <text start="309.01" dur="6.87">device that can bring down drones the</text>
  <text start="311.83" dur="7.11">anti UAV defense system a UDS costs</text>
  <text start="315.88" dur="6.93">about 1.2 million dollars an engineer&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="318.94" dur="6.12">claim that all they need to do is point</text>
  <text start="322.81" dur="6.18">this device at the drones doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="325.06" dur="8.31">their size doesn&amp;#39;t matter what kind they</text>
  <text start="328.99" dur="7.05">are it will bring them down from eight</text>
  <text start="333.37" dur="6.66">kilometers away it will halt its flight</text>
  <text start="336.04" dur="6.66">in 15 seconds and the drone is destroyed</text>
  <text start="340.03" dur="5.19">it comes falling to the earth and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="342.7" dur="5.25">done so why is this important well we</text>
  <text start="345.22" dur="6.75">know the u.s. uses drones in Pakistan</text>
  <text start="347.95" dur="6.78">Yemen Libya Lebanon Iraq and many other</text>
  <text start="351.97" dur="6.56">countries and once these countries start</text>
  <text start="354.73" dur="6.24">purchasing this device the drone Wars</text>
  <text start="358.53" dur="4.57">they&amp;#39;re going to come to an end so the</text>
  <text start="360.97" dur="4.79">millions or i should say the billions of</text>
  <text start="363.1" dur="4.62">dollars the u.s. invested in the drones</text>
  <text start="365.76" dur="5.77">most likely they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="367.72" dur="6.33">absolutely worthless now it looks like</text>
  <text start="371.53" dur="5.85">the US UK and the other coalition forces</text>
  <text start="374.05" dur="5.97">they are pushing a confrontation with</text>
  <text start="377.38" dur="5.4">Russia and as hard as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="380.02" dur="4.59">I mean turkey is out there saying</text>
  <text start="382.78" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re being harassed by Syrian</text>
  <text start="384.61" dur="5.52">warplanes by Russian warplanes and of</text>
  <text start="388.39" dur="5.43">course NATO is out there leading the</text>
  <text start="390.13" dur="6.27">charge and we see that in the news is a</text>
  <text start="393.82" dur="6.45">huge propaganda piece out there saying</text>
  <text start="396.4" dur="6.69">that turkey shot down a Russian jet now</text>
  <text start="400.27" dur="6.3">of course we can&amp;#39;t cite any sources they</text>
  <text start="403.09" dur="8.37">say they were anonymous and nobody has</text>
  <text start="406.57" dur="8.88">information on this whatsoever and this</text>
  <text start="411.46" dur="8.64">looks like it&amp;#39;s more propaganda coming</text>
  <text start="415.45" dur="7.35">out of the US UK NATO you name it to</text>
  <text start="420.1" dur="5.37">push the agenda that we need to get into</text>
  <text start="422.8" dur="4.68">war with Russia they want an incident</text>
  <text start="425.47" dur="5.669">they&amp;#39;re pushing as hard as they possibly</text>
  <text start="427.48" dur="5.04">can now Putin is out there he is</text>
  <text start="431.139" dur="4.261">that there&amp;#39;s going to be absolutely no</text>
  <text start="432.52" dur="4.979">ground troops in Syria now we know he</text>
  <text start="435.4" dur="5.34">called up about a hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="437.499" dur="6.42">thousand troops in Russia but at this</text>
  <text start="440.74" dur="7.32">point they have special forces in Syria</text>
  <text start="443.919" dur="5.911">right now but no full-on ground support</text>
  <text start="448.06" dur="4.909">and we&amp;#39;ll have to watch this very</text>
  <text start="449.83" dur="5.519">carefully because this could change I</text>
  <text start="452.969" dur="3.641">mean in the split second it depends well</text>
  <text start="455.349" dur="3.63">what happens in there right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="456.61" dur="4.5">using their air power and they are</text>
  <text start="458.979" dur="3.361">hitting the Islamic state targets which</text>
  <text start="461.11" dur="3.51">is the proxy army for the nine states</text>
  <text start="462.34" dur="3.96">government central bankers and they are</text>
  <text start="464.62" dur="5.46">winning but I see all over the corporate</text>
  <text start="466.3" dur="5.339">media the US government is continually</text>
  <text start="470.08" dur="3.179">saying that the Islamic state is making</text>
  <text start="471.639" dur="5.161">gains it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what the rush is</text>
  <text start="473.259" dur="5.31">doing it looks like Russia&amp;#39;s using their</text>
  <text start="476.8" dur="4.229">air strikes for cover for the Islamic</text>
  <text start="478.569" dur="4.081">state making them advance basically if</text>
  <text start="481.029" dur="2.971">you really think about it this is</text>
  <text start="482.65" dur="3.18">everything the United States was doing</text>
  <text start="484" dur="5.909">Russia&amp;#39;s in there and they are</text>
  <text start="485.83" dur="8.369">destroying the Islamic state now there</text>
  <text start="489.909" dur="5.43">was a leaked record explaining how the</text>
  <text start="494.199" dur="2.58">proxy army for the United States</text>
  <text start="495.339" dur="3.661">government central bankers received</text>
  <text start="496.779" dur="4.801">their funds they&amp;#39;re saying twenty-seven</text>
  <text start="499" dur="5.25">percent came from the oil sales in Syria</text>
  <text start="501.58" dur="4.799">all those regions they filled up the</text>
  <text start="504.25" dur="5.58">tankers they shipped them off and they</text>
  <text start="506.379" dur="4.741">had buyers all across Europe but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="509.83" dur="4.05">very interesting about this leaked</text>
  <text start="511.12" dur="6.029">document is that a lot of their funding</text>
  <text start="513.88" dur="5.31">came from taxes and confiscation once</text>
  <text start="517.149" dur="4.741">the proxy army went into certain areas</text>
  <text start="519.19" dur="5.07">inside Syria they tax the people and</text>
  <text start="521.89" dur="4.139">they confiscated their property and that</text>
  <text start="524.26" dur="4.199">made up of about twenty three point</text>
  <text start="526.029" dur="4.92">seven percent from taxes and forty four</text>
  <text start="528.459" dur="6.87">point seven percent from confiscation of</text>
  <text start="530.949" dur="5.611">property and remember this is the proxy</text>
  <text start="535.329" dur="3.331">army for the United States government</text>
  <text start="536.56" dur="4.769">central bankers look what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="538.66" dur="5.28">to the country the people inside that</text>
  <text start="541.329" dur="5.431">country they&amp;#39;re pretty much doing it</text>
  <text start="543.94" dur="4.32">here in the United States but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="546.76" dur="6.87">trying to convince everyone it&amp;#39;s for our</text>
  <text start="548.26" dur="7.55">own good now there has been a Isis</text>
  <text start="553.63" dur="6.54">communications that were intercepted and</text>
  <text start="555.81" dur="8.68">there is a growing panic among the proxy</text>
  <text start="560.17" dur="6.72">army and the Russian airstrikes are</text>
  <text start="564.49" dur="5.13">pretty much decimating the entire force</text>
  <text start="566.89" dur="5.04">and they&amp;#39;re being pushed back and things</text>
  <text start="569.62" dur="4.68">really do not look good and the United</text>
  <text start="571.93" dur="5.37">States government central bankers the UK</text>
  <text start="574.3" dur="5.28">are getting NATO are getting very very</text>
  <text start="577.3" dur="5.25">nervous about this because pretty soon</text>
  <text start="579.58" dur="7.35">there is going to be no proxy army</text>
  <text start="582.55" dur="8.039">inside Syria and we see that the elite</text>
  <text start="586.93" dur="6.81">forces from Syria are getting ready and</text>
  <text start="590.589" dur="5.37">prepared to take back a lot of the</text>
  <text start="593.74" dur="4.349">town&amp;#39;s the newly formed core of the</text>
  <text start="595.959" dur="6.121">Syrian army has between 60 and a hundred</text>
  <text start="598.089" dur="5.461">thousand troops and there are reports</text>
  <text start="602.08" dur="3.66">coming out that they are preparing a</text>
  <text start="603.55" dur="4.65">massive and significant operations in</text>
  <text start="605.74" dur="5.34">the northern parts of Syria following</text>
  <text start="608.2" dur="7.28">Russia&amp;#39;s recent bombings so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="611.08" dur="7.98">moving in and they&amp;#39;re weeding out all of</text>
  <text start="615.48" dur="7.479">the proxy army the free syrian army al</text>
  <text start="619.06" dur="8.88">Qaeda you name it it&amp;#39;s one big push to</text>

  <text start="696.97" dur="4.77">doesn&amp;#39;t may</text>
  <text start="698.35" dur="7.56">make sense now Russia is out there and</text>
  <text start="701.74" dur="8.16">they want an explanation of why British</text>
  <text start="705.91" dur="6.15">and NATO pilots have been given the</text>
  <text start="709.9" dur="4.59">green light to take drastic action</text>
  <text start="712.06" dur="4.59">against Russian fighter jets if they</text>
  <text start="714.49" dur="6.81">come under threat during missions over</text>
  <text start="716.65" dur="7.32">Iraq what a rack invited Russia in there</text>
  <text start="721.3" dur="7.62">and they&amp;#39;re all going after the same</text>
  <text start="723.97" dur="7.8">enemy right the Islamic state and NATO</text>
  <text start="728.92" dur="6.12">and England are saying that they could</text>
