  <text start="55.26" dur="5.19">october 19th 2016 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="58.38" dur="4.44">episode is central bankers want</text>
  <text start="60.45" dur="5.76">universal basic income for everyone to</text>
  <text start="62.82" dur="6.48">control the people let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="66.21" dur="5.55">economic collapse financial news now as</text>
  <text start="69.3" dur="6">everything is continually building up</text>
  <text start="71.76" dur="7.04">with the election with what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="75.3" dur="5.94">around the world we see the economy</text>
  <text start="78.8" dur="6.069">deteriorating very very quickly now I</text>
  <text start="81.24" dur="7.08">mean it is completely accelerated to the</text>
  <text start="84.869" dur="6.091">downside and it looks like at this point</text>
  <text start="88.32" dur="4.89">the central bankers are running out of</text>
  <text start="90.96" dur="5.189">time because as we come into this</text>
  <text start="93.21" dur="6.56">holiday season we&amp;#39;re going to see the</text>
  <text start="96.149" dur="6.151">economy completely implode on itself and</text>
  <text start="99.77" dur="6.82">when we look around we&amp;#39;ve been watching</text>
  <text start="102.3" dur="7.59">all these economic indicators decline</text>
  <text start="106.59" dur="6.089">further and further where it looks like</text>
  <text start="109.89" dur="5.85">we are completely in a recession right</text>
  <text start="112.679" dur="5.851">now heading towards a major collapse of</text>
  <text start="115.74" dur="7.079">the system and we continually look at</text>
  <text start="118.53" dur="7.35">housing and housing is absolutely awful</text>
  <text start="122.819" dur="6.091">I mean back in August we saw that</text>
  <text start="125.88" dur="6.57">housing starts and permits well they</text>
  <text start="128.91" dur="6.42">were awful September data well that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="132.45" dur="4.83">complete disaster now they thought</text>
  <text start="135.33" dur="4.41">housing was going to rise by</text>
  <text start="137.28" dur="4.44">two-point-nine percent but we know by</text>
  <text start="139.74" dur="4.829">looking at the housing market that this</text>
  <text start="141.72" dur="5.099">was completely impossible and we see</text>
  <text start="144.569" dur="5.581">right now that housing starts it has</text>
  <text start="146.819" dur="7.551">plunged by nine percent in September</text>
  <text start="150.15" dur="6.78">this is the weakest since march of 2015</text>
  <text start="154.37" dur="8.35">starts have crashed almost twelve</text>
  <text start="156.93" dur="9.889">percent the most since april of 2011 now</text>
  <text start="162.72" dur="7.379">for the first time since june of 2014</text>
  <text start="166.819" dur="5.651">housing starts fell for two months in a</text>
  <text start="170.099" dur="5.821">row crashing to twelve percent</text>
  <text start="172.47" dur="6.69">year-on-year because what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="175.92" dur="4.71">right now is first of all we&amp;#39;re out of</text>
  <text start="179.16" dur="3.39">hot season for real estate that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="180.63" dur="5.22">normally during this the summer months</text>
  <text start="182.55" dur="5.07">and no pun intended there but we are</text>
  <text start="185.85" dur="5.37">heading into the wintertime warehousing</text>
  <text start="187.62" dur="7.34">really slows and during this summer time</text>
  <text start="191.22" dur="7.2">we never saw housing really pick up</text>
  <text start="194.96" dur="5.68">multi-family housing collapse by thirty</text>
  <text start="198.42" dur="6.93">eight percent month-on-month forty</text>
  <text start="200.64" dur="6.99">percent year-on-year and this tells us</text>
  <text start="205.35" dur="5.67">something this is another economic</text>
  <text start="207.63" dur="6.78">indicator letting us know that we&amp;#39;re no</text>
  <text start="211.02" dur="7.14">longer in this shake recovery we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="214.41" dur="7.92">this recession teetering on a collapse</text>
  <text start="218.16" dur="8.61">and it&amp;#39;s not getting better because when</text>
  <text start="222.33" dur="9.12">we look at the cass freight index we see</text>
  <text start="226.77" dur="6.48">that shipments sank by 0.4% for the</text>
  <text start="231.45" dur="6.41">month and are down three-point-one</text>
  <text start="233.25" dur="7.49">percent from shipments a year ago now</text>
  <text start="237.86" dur="6.13">what this means is this holiday season</text>
  <text start="240.74" dur="5.14">it&amp;#39;s not known to be good at all the</text>
  <text start="243.99" dur="3.51">corporate media the US government</text>
  <text start="245.88" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re going to try to cover this up as</text>
  <text start="247.5" dur="4.2">best they possibly can on Black Friday</text>
  <text start="249.84" dur="3.51">Cyber Monday are probably gonna be a</text>
  <text start="251.7" dur="3.36">disaster now the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="253.35" dur="3.09">going to try to spin this they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="255.06" dur="2.64">to try to make it look like that</text>
  <text start="256.44" dur="3.56">everything is great they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="257.7" dur="5.4">show like you know those 10 people</text>
  <text start="260" dur="6.01">trying to get into walmart but rest of</text>
  <text start="263.1" dur="5.67">the stores are completely empty and when</text>
  <text start="266.01" dur="4.77">we look at cast freight index we see</text>
  <text start="268.77" dur="3.42">shipments are completely declining the</text>
  <text start="270.78" dur="3.96">shipments right now are lower than</text>
  <text start="272.19" dur="7.25">twenty fifteen twenty fourteen and</text>
  <text start="274.74" dur="7.38">twenty thirteen castrate expenditures</text>
  <text start="279.44" dur="4.72">well those are declining also and</text>
  <text start="282.12" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re lower than twenty fifteen twenty</text>
  <text start="284.16" dur="7.259">fourteen and twenty thirteen rail</text>
  <text start="286.68" dur="9.35">volumes are lower in 2016 then 2015 and</text>
  <text start="291.419" dur="7.141">2014 so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="296.03" dur="8.7">this holiday season is going to be a</text>
  <text start="298.56" dur="11.46">complete disaster and we understand that</text>
  <text start="304.73" dur="8.17">the retail market well it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="310.02" dur="5.85">do as well as it once did this is</text>
  <text start="312.9" dur="4.769">why stores continually close this is why</text>
  <text start="315.87" dur="4.4">we&amp;#39;re seeing more and more people being</text>
  <text start="317.669" dur="6.361">laid off from the retail industry and</text>
  <text start="320.27" dur="5.769">believe me people are not moving towards</text>
  <text start="324.03" dur="4.35">the online sales because we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="326.039" dur="5.341">seeing the decline in retail from</text>
  <text start="328.38" dur="4.8">brick-and-mortar stores reflected in the</text>
  <text start="331.38" dur="3.99">online sales where it&amp;#39;s going up the</text>
  <text start="333.18" dur="5.04">same amount what&amp;#39;s really happening is</text>
  <text start="335.37" dur="6.21">people are losing their jobs people</text>
  <text start="338.22" dur="6.509">don&amp;#39;t have that extra income to go out</text>
  <text start="341.58" dur="5.04">and purchase goods from these online</text>
  <text start="344.729" dur="4.801">stores or from the brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="346.62" dur="5.7">stores and as more and more people lose</text>
  <text start="349.53" dur="4.38">their jobs it&amp;#39;s just going to get worse</text>
  <text start="352.32" dur="4.23">and we&amp;#39;ve been seeing this and even the</text>
  <text start="353.91" dur="5.91">people that are finding the jobs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="356.55" dur="5.91">finding part-time work and the part-time</text>
  <text start="359.82" dur="5.34">work is not bringing in the same income</text>
  <text start="362.46" dur="4.8">and we have proved this over and over</text>
  <text start="365.16" dur="5.49">with the federal government tax receipts</text>
  <text start="367.26" dur="6.45">with the state tax receipts showing that</text>
  <text start="370.65" dur="5.639">revenue has continually declined even</text>
  <text start="373.71" dur="5.9">know the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="376.289" dur="7.38">are telling us that unemployment is</text>
  <text start="379.61" dur="8.22">almost at full capacity here which is a</text>
  <text start="383.669" dur="7.231">complete lie and we all know it is a lie</text>
  <text start="387.83" dur="5.86">we see the central banks they are making</text>
  <text start="390.9" dur="5.699">their move they only want one digital</text>
  <text start="393.69" dur="6.21">currency and that is their digital</text>
  <text start="396.599" dur="5.94">currency we see the ECB officially</text>
  <text start="399.9" dur="7.769">warned about the dangers of virtual</text>
  <text start="402.539" dur="9.301">currencies in general and they pointed</text>
  <text start="407.669" dur="5.761">to one in particular that is Bitcoin the</text>
  <text start="411.84" dur="4.17">increase in the use of virtual money</text>
  <text start="413.43" dur="6.15">they said might lead to a decrease in</text>
  <text start="416.01" dur="5.67">the use of real money thereby also</text>
  <text start="419.58" dur="4.26">reducing cash needed to conduct the</text>
  <text start="421.68" dur="4.56">transaction is generated by nominal</text>
  <text start="423.84" dur="4.199">income well that is true because people</text>
  <text start="426.24" dur="5.459">are going to say well we don&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="428.039" dur="6.451">central bank we don&amp;#39;t need to use their</text>
  <text start="431.699" dur="6.331">currency which is the dollar in the</text>
  <text start="434.49" dur="5.549">United States the euro in Europe will</text>
  <text start="438.03" dur="4.139">use this virtual currency and if we just</text>
  <text start="440.039" dur="4.921">deal in this guess what you don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="442.169" dur="4.771">to pay taxes on it unless you convert it</text>
  <text start="444.96" dur="6.76">over to</text>
  <text start="446.94" dur="7.21">the central bank currency and this is</text>
  <text start="451.72" dur="6.27">what they&amp;#39;re most afraid of because</text>
  <text start="454.15" dur="8.22">imagine if the public decided to use a</text>
  <text start="457.99" dur="6.92">virtual currency outside of the system</text>
  <text start="462.37" dur="5.13">or they decided use a physical currency</text>
  <text start="464.91" dur="6.19">outside of the system that is not</text>
  <text start="467.5" dur="6">attached to the central bank well guess</text>
  <text start="471.1" dur="5.72">what the central bank would have nothing</text>
  <text start="473.5" dur="6.18">to do with what they&amp;#39;re doing if stores</text>
  <text start="476.82" dur="8.95">decided to take Bitcoin some of them</text>
  <text start="479.68" dur="9.54">have until you convert it you&amp;#39;re fine</text>
  <text start="485.77" dur="6.69">and they&amp;#39;re very worried about this so</text>
  <text start="489.22" dur="6.48">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re creating</text>
  <text start="492.46" dur="6.33">legislation where they&amp;#39;re trying to get</text>
  <text start="495.7" dur="8.01">rid of Bitcoin and other virtual money</text>
  <text start="498.79" dur="7.5">and the ECB urged EU lawmakers to</text>
  <text start="503.71" dur="6.78">tighten proposed new rules on digital</text>
  <text start="506.29" dur="7.35">currencies fearing they might one day</text>
  <text start="510.49" dur="5.97">weaken their control over the money</text>
  <text start="513.64" dur="6.99">supply in Europe in the United States</text>
  <text start="516.46" dur="7.97">and everywhere the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="520.63" dur="6.24">very scared about other currency systems</text>
  <text start="524.43" dur="7.2">because it would be outside of their</text>
  <text start="526.87" dur="7.17">system now the central bank&amp;#39;s their</text>
  <text start="531.63" dur="4.93">agenda is to spread debt around the</text>
  <text start="534.04" dur="5.79">world we know this and they&amp;#39;ve spread</text>
  <text start="536.56" dur="5.07">that everywhere and they&amp;#39;re running out</text>
  <text start="539.83" dur="4.05">of places to do this most of the</text>
  <text start="541.63" dur="5.22">countries have so much debt they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="543.88" dur="5.43">even operate and most of the countries</text>
  <text start="546.85" dur="5.88">are implementing austerity on the people</text>
  <text start="549.31" dur="6.96">and these countries they&amp;#39;re collapsing</text>
  <text start="552.73" dur="6.81">and the debt level is getting so high it</text>
  <text start="556.27" dur="5.78">cannot be sustained and they know this</text>
  <text start="559.54" dur="5.25">they know jobs aren&amp;#39;t being created</text>
  <text start="562.05" dur="5.53">Manufacturing is declining the economies</text>
  <text start="564.79" dur="6.39">are declining rapidly we&amp;#39;re negative</text>
  <text start="567.58" dur="7.89">interest rates and what the central</text>
  <text start="571.18" dur="7.98">banks and governments like to do is they</text>
  <text start="575.47" dur="4.89">like to control the people they want to</text>
  <text start="579.16" dur="3.54">make sure that they</text>
  <text start="580.36" dur="7.02">have control and one way of doing this</text>
  <text start="582.7" dur="9.329">is using maybe a universal income to</text>
  <text start="587.38" dur="8.16">give everyone a certain amount of income</text>
  <text start="592.029" dur="6.031">every day even if they don&amp;#39;t work you</text>
  <text start="595.54" dur="5.88">don&amp;#39;t work or you do work if your job</text>
  <text start="598.06" dur="5.73">was out sorts to robots or technology</text>
  <text start="601.42" dur="6.02">doesn&amp;#39;t make a difference everyone will</text>
  <text start="603.79" dur="7.14">get paid now what happens is you become</text>
  <text start="607.44" dur="6.25">subservient to the central bank and the</text>
  <text start="610.93" dur="4.349">government and you have to do what the</text>
  <text start="613.69" dur="4.709">government wants so think about what</text>
  <text start="615.279" dur="5.24">they&amp;#39;re doing right now they will</text>
  <text start="618.399" dur="6.451">implement this some people call it</text>
  <text start="620.519" dur="7.481">helicopter money but a universal basic</text>
  <text start="624.85" dur="7.08">income is not a one-time thing it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="628" dur="6.029">continuous thing where they will be able</text>
  <text start="631.93" dur="5.88">to control the people because the people</text>
  <text start="634.029" dur="8.101">will be dependent on them this is what</text>
  <text start="637.81" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;re doing with health insurance they</text>
  <text start="642.13" dur="4.74">want you dependent on the government</text>
  <text start="644.44" dur="5.339">you&amp;#39;re receiving subsidies you&amp;#39;re under</text>
  <text start="646.87" dur="5.57">Obamacare this is what you have to do if</text>
  <text start="649.779" dur="6">you want this you have to be vaccinated</text>
  <text start="652.44" dur="7.959">you have to take the treatment that we</text>
  <text start="655.779" dur="6.93">say you have to do what we want so think</text>
  <text start="660.399" dur="4.141">about what they&amp;#39;re doing right now if</text>
  <text start="662.709" dur="3.511">they&amp;#39;re going to give you an income</text>
  <text start="664.54" dur="7.109">they&amp;#39;re going to give you health</text>
  <text start="666.22" dur="7.979">insurance they control the population at</text>
  <text start="671.649" dur="3.841">this point and this is what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="674.199" dur="4.171">trying to do for a very long time</text>
  <text start="675.49" dur="4.89">because they&amp;#39;re afraid of the people the</text>
  <text start="678.37" dur="4.26">people scare them quite a bit because</text>
  <text start="680.38" dur="5.97">there&amp;#39;s a lot more of the people than</text>
  <text start="682.63" dur="6.6">there are of them and this is why they</text>
  <text start="686.35" dur="5.37">want them dependent on the government</text>
  <text start="689.23" dur="4.71">now in the beginning it&amp;#39;s when they</text>
  <text start="691.72" dur="6.059">mention what when they created the</text>
  <text start="693.94" dur="7.889">welfare system they created programs to</text>
  <text start="697.779" dur="5.821">help the poor it sounded good and it</text>
  <text start="701.829" dur="4.741">sounded like oh the government is trying</text>
  <text start="703.6" dur="6.51">to help they&amp;#39;re trying to help these</text>
  <text start="706.57" dur="7.68">individuals but we have to think about</text>
  <text start="710.11" dur="7.17">why do these individuals need help wyd</text>
  <text start="714.25" dur="5.52">we still have poverty why is the</text>
  <text start="717.28" dur="6.54">infrastructure continually deteriorating</text>
  <text start="719.77" dur="5.34">in the United States were allegedly one</text>
  <text start="723.82" dur="4.53">of the wealthiest countries in the world</text>
  <text start="725.11" dur="6.39">and I know we&amp;#39;re not the top but we</text>
  <text start="728.35" dur="6.18">create the currency out of thin air well</text>
  <text start="731.5" dur="6">the Federal Reserve does but if you</text>
  <text start="734.53" dur="5.16">notice none of those funds are being</text>
  <text start="737.5" dur="7.23">filtered back into the United States to</text>
  <text start="739.69" dur="8.82">the people so once again it goes back to</text>
  <text start="744.73" dur="6.09">the central bank because their agenda is</text>
  <text start="748.51" dur="4.77">not to help the people their agenda is</text>
  <text start="750.82" dur="5.07">not to wipe out poverty their agenda is</text>
  <text start="753.28" dur="6.95">not to fix the infrastructure inside the</text>
  <text start="755.89" dur="11.54">United States our government employees</text>
  <text start="760.23" dur="10.72">our government servants they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="767.43" dur="9.16">controlled by corporations by central</text>
  <text start="770.95" dur="9.44">banks by foreign governments they do not</text>
  <text start="776.59" dur="7.41">work for the people they work for others</text>
  <text start="780.39" dur="7.06">this is why when you look at our country</text>
  <text start="784" dur="5.91">today you see that nothing&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="787.45" dur="5.88">changed actually the poverty level has</text>
  <text start="789.91" dur="6.54">gone up there are more people on food</text>
