  <text start="44.64" dur="4.919">situation in Greece it is really heating</text>
  <text start="47.579" dur="4.23">up right now as we know the government</text>
  <text start="49.559" dur="5.011">is gonna confiscate local government</text>
  <text start="51.809" dur="4.441">reserves and basically sweep them into</text>
  <text start="54.57" dur="5.73">the central bank to provide the country</text>
  <text start="56.25" dur="8.67">more funds as it approaches another</text>
  <text start="60.3" dur="6.72">month of huge repayment to the IMF now</text>
  <text start="64.92" dur="4.559">the ECB is out there and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="67.02" dur="5.01">to reduce central bank risk they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="69.479" dur="5.161">going to ease their collateral read the</text>
  <text start="72.03" dur="6.3">collateral requirements for Greece to</text>
  <text start="74.64" dur="6.269">set them around 75% or to set them at 90</text>
  <text start="78.33" dur="4.289">percent the latter two options could be</text>
  <text start="80.909" dur="6.181">applied if Greece is in an orderly</text>
  <text start="82.619" dur="7.591">default or under a formal ECB program or</text>
  <text start="87.09" dur="6.66">a disorderly default so what are we</text>
  <text start="90.21" dur="6.39">seeing here we see that the ECB the</text>
  <text start="93.75" dur="5.52">central banking system they are getting</text>
  <text start="96.6" dur="6.18">prepared for something to happen they do</text>
  <text start="99.27" dur="5.79">believe that Greece is going to exit and</text>
  <text start="102.78" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re getting ready we see the</text>
  <text start="105.06" dur="4.349">European Center for international</text>

  <text start="112.71" dur="5.97">completely isolated it will not affect</text>
  <text start="115.95" dur="4.47">anything don&amp;#39;t worry about it and like I</text>
  <text start="118.68" dur="3.329">said in the past every time a government</text>
  <text start="120.42" dur="4.71">official central banker comes out and</text>
  <text start="122.009" dur="6.72">tells you it&amp;#39;s okay everything is fine</text>
  <text start="125.13" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s contained it&amp;#39;s isolated think about</text>
  <text start="128.729" dur="4.951">it these all the words they always use</text>
  <text start="130.56" dur="5.879">when there&amp;#39;s a disaster headed our</text>
  <text start="133.68" dur="5.88">way I mean think back to 2007 going into</text>
  <text start="136.439" dur="4.02">2008 the subprime securities there</text>
  <text start="139.56" dur="5.67">contained</text>
  <text start="140.459" dur="7.11">Bear Stearns is isolated it&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="145.23" dur="5.61">thing they&amp;#39;re telling us once again and</text>
  <text start="147.569" dur="6.57">this lets us know that something major</text>
  <text start="150.84" dur="6.42">is about to happen we see that Germany</text>
  <text start="154.139" dur="6.18">is also very confident that Europe won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="157.26" dur="6.899">take any risk to endanger global economy</text>
  <text start="160.319" dur="6.84">the eurozone has basically overcome all</text>
  <text start="164.159" dur="5.58">the crises that were apparent you know</text>
  <text start="167.159" dur="5.821">in the last couple of years and there is</text>
  <text start="169.739" dur="6.301">absolutely no contagion whatsoever</text>
  <text start="172.98" dur="4.83">I mean seriously they&amp;#39;re really trying</text>
  <text start="176.04" dur="4.8">to convince us right now that everything</text>
  <text start="177.81" dur="5.819">has been solved but here in the United</text>
  <text start="180.84" dur="4.14">States it seems the White House is a</text>
  <text start="183.629" dur="5.371">little bit more concerned right now</text>
  <text start="184.98" dur="6.42">adviser Jason Furman says a Greek exit</text>
  <text start="189" dur="4.95">from the eurozone would present very</text>
  <text start="191.4" dur="5.519">large an unnecessary risk for global</text>
  <text start="193.95" dur="6.24">economy he also said that the Greek exit</text>
  <text start="196.919" dur="5.19">involves a large tail risk could impede</text>
  <text start="200.19" dur="5.12">investment create uncertainty in the</text>
  <text start="202.109" dur="6.99">markets and threaten economic recovery</text>
  <text start="205.31" dur="6.639">yes this is going to be a disaster it</text>
  <text start="209.099" dur="3.871">might not seem that way right in the</text>
  <text start="211.949" dur="4.771">beginning because you have to remember</text>
  <text start="212.97" dur="6.689">the Banking Committee decided you know</text>
  <text start="216.72" dur="4.799">what if Greek exit exits and they</text>
  <text start="219.659" dur="4.41">default on their loan it&amp;#39;s really not a</text>
  <text start="221.519" dur="4.951">default we really don&amp;#39;t have to pay up</text>
  <text start="224.069" dur="4.89">at this time and in the beginning when</text>
  <text start="226.47" dur="5.43">this does occur nothing might not</text>
  <text start="228.959" dur="4.71">nothing might happen and then as we go</text>
  <text start="231.9" dur="4.289">down the line in other countries say you</text>
  <text start="233.669" dur="5.371">know something we can do the same thing</text>
  <text start="236.189" dur="7.14">this is when the problems going to hit</text>
  <text start="239.04" dur="6.36">and we see when all this is happening at</text>
  <text start="243.329" dur="6">the same time Greece is looking at</text>
  <text start="245.4" dur="8.94">Russia they may sign a gas link Accord</text>
  <text start="249.329" dur="8.91">and guess what they might pivot to</text>
  <text start="254.34" dur="7.86">Russia Russia will guarantee for hunt of</text>
  <text start="258.239" dur="5.79">47 B cm per year of gas via Greece with</text>
  <text start="262.2" dur="3.959">the limit to be built by Russian</text>

  <text start="266.159" dur="5.521">billion euro</text>
  <text start="268.52" dur="4.78">Russia right now basically is waiting</text>
  <text start="271.68" dur="6.6">for the official admission from Greece</text>
  <text start="273.3" dur="7.86">that it will pivot to them and we could</text>
  <text start="278.28" dur="6.48">see right now that they are ready to go</text>
  <text start="281.16" dur="6.39">gas prom CEO Miller comments on gasoline</text>
  <text start="284.76" dur="5.61">to EU on Russian TV saying that Greek</text>

  <text start="290.37" dur="6.69">two billion euros gas linked to EU may</text>
  <text start="294.06" dur="7.92">be built by Russia Russia guarantees</text>
  <text start="297.06" dur="9.5">transit we see gas prom as saying that</text>
  <text start="301.98" dur="7.95">yeah we might Ford them money in advance</text>
  <text start="306.56" dur="7.48">so they might be receiving about five</text>
  <text start="309.93" dur="10.29">billion dollars or so in funds to help</text>
  <text start="314.04" dur="10.89">out and they might use this to maybe pay</text>
  <text start="320.22" dur="10.38">off the IMF and then exit or not pay off</text>
  <text start="324.93" dur="7.83">the IMF just default and exit so we can</text>
  <text start="330.6" dur="4.11">see right now that the gas transit</text>

  <text start="1157.98" dur="6.27">helm a lot of things are being talked</text>
  <text start="1160.56" dur="8.04">about why this is happening and one of</text>
  <text start="1164.25" dur="6.54">the scenarios is that Walmart closed</text>
  <text start="1168.6" dur="5.42">these stores because of a plumbing issue</text>
  <text start="1170.79" dur="5.61">but again there was no plumbing permit</text>
  <text start="1174.02" dur="6.73">basically issued they didn&amp;#39;t apply for</text>
  <text start="1176.4" dur="6.84">one so that seems a little strange we</text>
  <text start="1180.75" dur="5.67">also understand that they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="1183.24" dur="5.04">Walmart stores closed in retaliation to</text>
  <text start="1186.42" dur="6.72">those employees who are picketing for</text>
  <text start="1188.28" dur="6.54">more weight for an increase in wages the</text>
  <text start="1193.14" dur="4.2">one store in particular the Pico Rivera</text>

  <text start="1204.09" dur="5.43">they closed all of these stores to get</text>
  <text start="1206.49" dur="4.68">back at the employees which kind of not</text>
  <text start="1209.52" dur="4.26">doesn&amp;#39;t really make sense I mean I know</text>
  <text start="1211.17" dur="5.45">what they&amp;#39;re trying to say but would</text>
  <text start="1213.78" dur="5.82">Walmart actually close their stores and</text>
  <text start="1216.62" dur="6.34">give up the revenue from the stores just</text>
  <text start="1219.6" dur="7.38">to get back at the employees for six</text>
  <text start="1222.96" dur="6.36">months I mean is this something a</text>
  <text start="1226.98" dur="3.75">business would do to me it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1229.32" dur="4.29">really make sense I don&amp;#39;t know if they</text>
  <text start="1230.73" dur="4.47">go to that extreme but people are out</text>
  <text start="1233.61" dur="5.4">there saying that this is one of the</text>
  <text start="1235.2" dur="6.81">reasons the other reason is that maybe</text>
  <text start="1239.01" dur="4.95">the government has paid them for the</text>
  <text start="1242.01" dur="5.85">revenue for the six months and they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1258.96" dur="4.77">the reason is and what we can do is look</text>
  <text start="1261.03" dur="5.64">at this and say okay let&amp;#39;s use some</text>
  <text start="1263.73" dur="6.3">common sense as a business they would</text>
  <text start="1266.67" dur="7.65">actually close five stores give up the</text>

  <text start="1282.54" dur="7.44">something really doesn&amp;#39;t make sense here</text>
  <text start="1286.04" dur="6.49">but we do understand that these areas</text>

  <text start="2186.9" dur="4.53">beefing up their naval presence off of</text>

  <text start="2191.43" dur="7.59">we&amp;#39;re bringing these ships in because</text>
  <text start="2192.81" dur="9.42">Iran is bringing in weapons to Yemen</text>
  <text start="2199.02" dur="7.29">helping the Houthis but think about this</text>
  <text start="2202.23" dur="7.02">why would a rim sail ships to Yemen with</text>
  <text start="2206.31" dur="5.76">weapons when they know the u.s. fleet is</text>
  <text start="2209.25" dur="5.43">right there it&amp;#39;s not like the u.s. fleet</text>

  <text start="2214.68" dur="5.01">carriers we know the amphibious warships</text>
  <text start="2216.57" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;re all there why would they go</text>
  <text start="2219.69" dur="5.37">right there and do what they wouldn&amp;#39;t so</text>
  <text start="2222.42" dur="4.77">what is Iran doing and why is the</text>
  <text start="2225.06" dur="3.84">propaganda coming out well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2227.19" dur="4.74">trying to blame all of this on Iran</text>
  <text start="2228.9" dur="7.26">they&amp;#39;re using propaganda against Iran</text>
  <text start="2231.93" dur="7.5">and most likely these ships are carrying</text>
  <text start="2236.16" dur="4.83">humanitarian aid and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="2239.43" dur="3.78">this to reach the shores of Yemen</text>
  <text start="2240.99" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re trying to basically block off</text>

  <text start="2245.91" dur="7.35">to make them say we give this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2249.72" dur="6.06">going on and we can see the propaganda</text>
  <text start="2253.26" dur="5.31">is flying all over the place that Iran</text>
  <text start="2255.78" dur="4.26">is helping the hootie supplying them</text>
  <text start="2258.57" dur="4.68">weapons and this is why the story is out</text>
  <text start="2260.04" dur="6.6">here but it makes no sense why would I</text>
  <text start="2263.25" dur="5.069">ran do this they wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2266.64" dur="2.909">they wouldn&amp;#39;t do it right out in the</text>

  <text start="2269.549" dur="2.881">first place</text>
  <text start="2270.21" dur="5.76">and this is how you know this is</text>
  <text start="2272.43" dur="5.399">complete propaganda of course the u.s.</text>
  <text start="2275.97" dur="3.629">is out there saying the purpose of the</text>
  <text start="2277.829" dur="4.381">US aircraft carrier presence in the Gulf</text>
  <text start="2279.599" dur="4.77">of Aden is to protect navigation and</text>
  <text start="2282.21" dur="4.17">commerce in the region know what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2284.369" dur="3.781">really doing is they&amp;#39;re keeping that</text>
  <text start="2286.38" dur="4.229">choke point point between the Red Sea</text>
  <text start="2288.15" dur="4.8">and the Gulf of Aden open they want the</text>
  <text start="2290.609" dur="7.47">oil to continually flow through they</text>
  <text start="2292.95" dur="9.24">don&amp;#39;t want to lose that area and that is</text>
  <text start="2298.079" dur="6.331">what they are guarding that&amp;#39;s it because</text>
  <text start="2302.19" dur="3.899">of that is cut off phase is going to be</text>
  <text start="2304.41" dur="3.899">major major problems in this area and</text>
  <text start="2306.089" dur="6.331">this is why they can&amp;#39;t give up Yemen</text>
  <text start="2308.309" dur="7.23">because Yemen and Djibouti they control</text>
  <text start="2312.42" dur="4.909">that choke point right there and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2315.539" dur="4.74">seeing and we&amp;#39;re hearing reports that</text>

  <text start="2339.329" dur="4.71">of the decision to end the offensive</text>
  <text start="2341.759" dur="3.741">comes following a crest by the Yemeni</text>

  <text start="2354.98" dur="6.389">they always use these terms that really</text>
  <text start="2359.009" dur="6.81">mean the opposite restoring hope means</text>
  <text start="2361.369" dur="6.611">invasion of Yemen and put down and</text>
  <text start="2365.819" dur="5.611">control the situation that&amp;#39;s what it</text>
  <text start="2367.98" dur="6.15">really means basically the coalition are</text>
  <text start="2371.43" dur="4.32">going to invade Yemen at this point in</text>
  <text start="2374.13" dur="4.83">time they&amp;#39;re going to control the</text>
  <text start="2375.75" dur="6.63">Houthis and we can see they are</text>
  <text start="2378.96" dur="5.76">definitely preparing for this there has</text>
  <text start="2382.38" dur="6.75">been very little progress made in</text>
  <text start="2384.72" dur="8.069">pushing back the Houthi rebellion inside</text>

  <text start="2392.789" dur="5.55">effect they thought it was going to have</text>
  <text start="2395.569" dur="4.941">Saudi Arabia right now has their</text>

  <text start="2405.19" dur="6.6">campaign against the Houthis in Yemen</text>
  <text start="2409.02" dur="5.17">basically they&amp;#39;re getting ready for a</text>
  <text start="2411.79" dur="4.74">LAN war they think they knocked out what</text>
  <text start="2414.19" dur="3.93">they needed to knock out they punish the</text>
  <text start="2416.53" dur="4.11">people as much as they possibly could</text>
  <text start="2418.12" dur="3.72">punish them with airstrikes and you know</text>
  <text start="2420.64" dur="4.05">they don&amp;#39;t want to destroy the entire</text>
  <text start="2421.84" dur="6.45">infrastructure and now they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="2424.69" dur="9.33">try a land war how is this going to turn</text>
  <text start="2428.29" dur="8.1">out most likely not that well and we can</text>
  <text start="2434.02" dur="5.31">see the u.s. is getting ready to get</text>
  <text start="2436.39" dur="6.15">involved in this the Iranian ships are</text>
  <text start="2439.33" dur="5.79">parked right outside Iran is calling for</text>
  <text start="2442.54" dur="6.3">a complete ceasefire China is calling</text>
  <text start="2445.12" dur="8.19">for a complete ceasefire and we can see</text>
  <text start="2448.84" dur="8.67">at this point that this can really start</text>
  <text start="2453.31" dur="6.75">something huge in this area and we know</text>
  <text start="2457.51" dur="4.86">they will then maneuver to the next</text>
  <text start="2460.06" dur="5.34">country and the next Trani country to</text>
  <text start="2462.37" dur="4.77">try to control what is going on this is</text>
  <text start="2465.4" dur="4.53">going to turn out to be an all-out war</text>
  <text start="2467.14" dur="5.22">unless it could be stopped maybe Russia</text>
  <text start="2469.93" dur="5.31">will step in they stepped in many many</text>
  <text start="2472.36" dur="4.77">times before but if they just let the</text>
  <text start="2475.24" dur="6.12">u.s. go off and the coalition goat</text>
  <text start="2477.13" dur="7.29">forces go off once if they can capture</text>
  <text start="2481.36" dur="5.34">this area they will then maneuver to</text>
  <text start="2484.42" dur="7.43">Libya they will then maneuver to Lebanon</text>
  <text start="2486.7" dur="8.28">and do the same thing at least try to</text>
  <text start="2491.85" dur="5.29">but I can see the people there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2494.98" dur="5.07">ready for a ground fight they&amp;#39;re ready</text>
  <text start="2497.14" dur="5.19">to attack and you have to remember Saudi</text>
  <text start="2500.05" dur="4.32">Arabia and the other coalition forces</text>
  <text start="2502.33" dur="4.41">Yemen has never done anything to them</text>
  <text start="2504.37" dur="5.4">they just went ahead and invaded a</text>
  <text start="2506.74" dur="6.69">country that&amp;#39;s all that has happened</text>
  <text start="2509.77" dur="6">just like what&amp;#39;s happening in Iraq the</text>
  <text start="2513.43" dur="8.22">same thing happening in Lebanon Libya</text>
  <text start="2515.77" dur="7.92">and Syria Assad was out there and he has</text>
  <text start="2521.65" dur="4.32">slammed France for alleged terrorist</text>
  <text start="2523.69" dur="5.01">support in his country saying Paris is</text>

  <text start="2534.099" dur="4.5">American foreign policy in the region</text>

  <text start="2538.599" dur="8.821">terrorists infiltrating Syria yeah at</text>
  <text start="2543.009" dur="7.23">this point in time we know that the</text>
  <text start="2547.42" dur="7.76">Islamic state basically is the proxy</text>

  <text start="2569.2" dur="4.71">that has the Islamic state in there they</text>
  <text start="2572.47" dur="2.369">wanted to include the Islamic state</text>

  <text start="2598.42" dur="5.939">government nothing is said about that</text>
  <text start="2600.4" dur="7.349">but it seems like it&amp;#39;s losing its shock</text>
  <text start="2604.359" dur="4.86">value people are ignoring the Islamic</text>
