  <text start="122.77" dur="6.54">we have no say in what they do and this</text>
  <text start="127.03" dur="5.819">is their biggest fear their biggest fear</text>
  <text start="129.31" dur="6.66">is the people finding out what this is</text>
  <text start="132.849" dur="6.991">all about and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="135.97" dur="6.239">pushing so hard to derail this now here</text>
  <text start="139.84" dur="6.36">in the united states we see the economy</text>
  <text start="142.209" dur="6.39">it is sinking fast it is not getting</text>
  <text start="146.2" dur="7.59">better whatsoever we see caterpillar</text>

  <text start="153.79" dur="5.21">see us retail sales they have once again</text>
  <text start="156.58" dur="5.03">started to deteriorate dramatically</text>
  <text start="159" dur="4.96">remember back in april they slid by</text>
  <text start="161.61" dur="4.39">eleven percent they do</text>
  <text start="163.96" dur="6.14">lined in May they declined by twelve</text>
  <text start="166" dur="7.35">percent and right now we are seeing this</text>

  <text start="186.04" dur="9.74">months of consecutive declining retail</text>
  <text start="191.53" dur="9.81">sales this has never happened in the</text>
  <text start="195.78" dur="8.13">company&amp;#39;s history how possibly can we be</text>
  <text start="201.34" dur="5.58">in a recovery and the economy doing well</text>
  <text start="203.91" dur="5.41">because we need to think about this back</text>
  <text start="206.92" dur="5.82">during the Great Recession we had 19</text>
  <text start="209.32" dur="7.47">months of declining sales we&amp;#39;re at 42</text>
  <text start="212.74" dur="6.9">months of declining sales I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="216.79" dur="4.62">by what I think we&amp;#39;re past this Great</text>
  <text start="219.64" dur="5.28">Recession mark right now we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="221.41" dur="6.12">total depression collapse now Obama is</text>
  <text start="224.92" dur="7.08">out there and he is continually telling</text>
  <text start="227.53" dur="6.99">us that the economy is absolutely doing</text>
  <text start="232" dur="5.25">fine actually earlier this month in</text>
  <text start="234.52" dur="6.24">Indiana he accused his critics of</text>
  <text start="237.25" dur="8.64">ignoring the facts and purporting miss</text>
  <text start="240.76" dur="8.25">about his economic record really so when</text>
  <text start="245.89" dur="8.51">we look at his economic record what do</text>
  <text start="249.01" dur="9.86">we find well this is what they predicted</text>
  <text start="254.4" dur="9.22">during his presidency going back to 2010</text>
  <text start="258.87" dur="8.98">he said gdp was going to grow back in</text>
  <text start="263.62" dur="9.54">2010 by 2.5 three percent gdp grew by</text>
  <text start="267.85" dur="8.34">two percent completely off 2011 they</text>
  <text start="273.16" dur="5.49">said well the economy is doing so well</text>
  <text start="276.19" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;re going to have a gdp of three point</text>
  <text start="278.65" dur="7.65">eight percent the gdp came in at one</text>
  <text start="281.05" dur="7.58">point six percent in 2012 they said the</text>
  <text start="286.3" dur="5.69">economy the unemployment&amp;#39;s coming down</text>
  <text start="288.63" dur="5.86">retails expanding housings expanding</text>
  <text start="291.99" dur="4.36">everything looks fantastic manufacturing</text>
  <text start="294.49" dur="2.88">is incredible we&amp;#39;re going to have a gdp</text>
  <text start="296.35" dur="6.69">of four</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="7.65">sent Jeannie became in 2.2 2% in 2013</text>
  <text start="303.04" dur="5.51">they said the same thing four percent</text>
  <text start="305.02" dur="7.5">came in at one point five 1.49 percent</text>
  <text start="308.55" dur="6.81">2014 2.4 three percent they were saying</text>
  <text start="312.52" dur="5.76">four percent once again going to 2015</text>
  <text start="315.36" dur="5.47">we&amp;#39;re seeing the same exact thing over</text>
  <text start="318.28" dur="4.35">and over and of course 2016 it is a</text>
  <text start="320.83" dur="4.74">complete disaster actually if you strip</text>
  <text start="322.63" dur="7.11">out Obamacare from all of this guess</text>
  <text start="325.57" dur="6.48">what happens GDP goes into negative</text>
  <text start="329.74" dur="4.62">territory if you go back in time and you</text>
  <text start="332.05" dur="3.63">remove their manipulated calculations</text>
  <text start="334.36" dur="2.61">where they included research and</text>
  <text start="335.68" dur="3.87">development since nineteen twenty nine</text>
  <text start="336.97" dur="4.35">count recalculated the entire GDP up to</text>
  <text start="339.55" dur="5.91">the present day we are in the negative</text>
  <text start="341.32" dur="7.74">range so his record is really not that</text>
  <text start="345.46" dur="7.65">good actually it looks like he&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="349.06" dur="6.09">there peddling the fiction now Obamacare</text>
  <text start="353.11" dur="3.3">when of course he pushed this out he</text>
  <text start="355.15" dur="3.329">said everyone was going to save on</text>
  <text start="356.41" dur="3.39">health care everyone&amp;#39;s going to save</text>
  <text start="358.479" dur="4.761">about twenty five hundred dollars per</text>
  <text start="359.8" dur="6.21">family and what have we seen we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="363.24" dur="6.07">insurance premiums increased by thirty</text>
  <text start="366.01" dur="5.87">to fifty percent business owners right</text>
  <text start="369.31" dur="4.68">now they&amp;#39;re hiring fewer people and</text>
  <text start="371.88" dur="7.45">they&amp;#39;re trying to keep their employees</text>
  <text start="373.99" dur="8.13">under the 50 employee mark and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="379.33" dur="8.519">reducing hours this is not helping the</text>
  <text start="382.12" dur="7.859">job market regulations well what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="387.849" dur="4.861">seeing right now is according to the</text>
  <text start="389.979" dur="5.071">Heritage Foundation study more than 22</text>
  <text start="392.71" dur="4.65">billion per year in new regulatory</text>
  <text start="395.05" dur="4.53">course were imposed on Americans closing</text>
  <text start="397.36" dur="6.119">Americans nearly 100 billion annually</text>
  <text start="399.58" dur="5.49">under Obama&amp;#39;s presidency taxes Obama has</text>
  <text start="403.479" dur="3.091">raised taxes on investment income by</text>
  <text start="405.07" dur="3.93">nearly sixty percent raising capital</text>
  <text start="406.57" dur="5.21">gains from fifteen to twenty four</text>
  <text start="409" dur="5.61">percent and push the top marginal rate</text>
  <text start="411.78" dur="5.56">the tax on small business owners to</text>
  <text start="414.61" dur="5.01">forty percent the u.s. right now has the</text>
  <text start="417.34" dur="5.16">highest business tax rate in the world</text>
  <text start="419.62" dur="4.65">and you know what this does it causes</text>
  <text start="422.5" dur="4.5">the companies to say you know what let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="424.27" dur="5.13">move out of the United States let&amp;#39;s take</text>
  <text start="427" dur="3.71">our jobs and move them to a different</text>
  <text start="429.4" dur="4.46">place where we&amp;#39;re not taxed</text>
  <text start="430.71" dur="5.22">hi so when we look at his record it is</text>
  <text start="433.86" dur="4.05">not good whatsoever actually when we</text>
  <text start="435.93" dur="3.84">look at this we can see the economy has</text>
  <text start="437.91" dur="4.68">gone absolutely nowhere it&amp;#39;s gotten a</text>
  <text start="439.77" dur="4.86">lot worse the manipulation makes it seem</text>
  <text start="442.59" dur="4.62">like things have gotten better but when</text>
  <text start="444.63" dur="6.12">we look at the real facts we are nowhere</text>
  <text start="447.21" dur="5.88">near any type of recovery we&amp;#39;re going in</text>
  <text start="450.75" dur="4.56">the opposite direction and this is what</text>
  <text start="453.09" dur="3.69">always happens when you listen to these</text>
  <text start="455.31" dur="3.36">government officials these government</text>
  <text start="456.78" dur="3.93">employees whatever they say it is always</text>
  <text start="458.67" dur="3.72">the opposite the bolts Troy index has</text>
  <text start="460.71" dur="8.46">dropped another five points we&amp;#39;re down</text>
  <text start="462.39" dur="12.63">to 582 and we do have proof that we are</text>
  <text start="469.17" dur="8.64">in the biggest bubble of all time think</text>
  <text start="475.02" dur="5.28">about this for a second the median price</text>
  <text start="477.81" dur="7.23">to sales ratio on the S&amp;amp;P 500 companies</text>
  <text start="480.3" dur="6.05">is now over too well it doesn&amp;#39;t sound</text>
  <text start="485.04" dur="4.77">like much what does that really mean</text>
  <text start="486.35" dur="7.51">well think about this during the tech</text>
  <text start="489.81" dur="6.12">bubble we were at one point six during</text>
  <text start="493.86" dur="8.01">the housing bubble of the Great</text>
  <text start="495.93" dur="8.7">Recession we were at 1.75 put it another</text>
  <text start="501.87" dur="4.77">way the market has never been more</text>
  <text start="504.63" dur="6.6">expensive relative to the money</text>
  <text start="506.64" dur="8.72">corporations receive in sales this is a</text>
  <text start="511.23" dur="6.96">complete disaster it looks absolutely</text>
  <text start="515.36" dur="5.89">awful when you look at the real data the</text>
  <text start="518.19" dur="8.46">hard core data this economy is failing</text>
  <text start="521.25" dur="11.4">and it&amp;#39;s failing hard now very</text>
  <text start="526.65" dur="9.57">interestingly Obama is out there and he</text>
  <text start="532.65" dur="5.49">is saying that this is the time to</text>
  <text start="536.22" dur="3.69">invest in the United States put your</text>
  <text start="538.14" dur="4.74">money in the stock market you have</text>
  <text start="539.91" dur="6.3">nothing to lose well we need to go back</text>
  <text start="542.88" dur="5.52">in time a little bit back in 2014 when</text>
  <text start="546.21" dur="3.54">they were putting the pressure on Russia</text>
  <text start="548.4" dur="3.09">which they&amp;#39;re continually doing by</text>
  <text start="549.75" dur="5.79">lowering the oil prices with the</text>
  <text start="551.49" dur="6.18">sanctions they said listen this is not</text>
  <text start="555.54" dur="4.02">the time to invest in Russia their</text>
  <text start="557.67" dur="3.49">economy is failing they said this back</text>
  <text start="559.56" dur="4">in 2014</text>
  <text start="561.16" dur="5.489">their market is going to crash any</text>
  <text start="563.56" dur="7.139">minute and they said this when the</text>
  <text start="566.649" dur="7.23">Russian market was at 1275 that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="570.699" dur="6.2">they announced the market in Russia is</text>
  <text start="573.879" dur="8.101">going to crash do not invest in Russia</text>
  <text start="576.899" dur="7.661">the market is up to 1902 now the</text>
  <text start="581.98" dur="5.159">president is out there and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="584.56" dur="5.67">that this is the time to invest in the</text>
  <text start="587.139" dur="8.82">United States and the S&amp;amp;P is at all-time</text>
  <text start="590.23" dur="8.609">highs which tells us that whatever they</text>
  <text start="595.959" dur="5.49">say it&amp;#39;s going to be the opposite that</text>
  <text start="598.839" dur="4.321">means they&amp;#39;re trying to get everyone in</text>
  <text start="601.449" dur="6.721">at this point at the height of the</text>
  <text start="603.16" dur="8.31">market so they can make the elite</text>
  <text start="608.17" dur="5.64">whoever is doing this as much as they</text>
  <text start="611.47" dur="5.969">possibly can and get out of the market</text>
  <text start="613.81" dur="5.759">by selling the investments to retail</text>
  <text start="617.439" dur="4.32">investors they want to get out right now</text>
  <text start="619.569" dur="6.151">because we are at the top and it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="621.759" dur="5.731">to crash this is definitely what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="625.72" dur="4.25">happening right now because whatever</text>
  <text start="627.49" dur="5.399">they say if you look at all the evidence</text>
  <text start="629.97" dur="4.299">it&amp;#39;s always the opposite and if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="632.889" dur="3.781">telling you to get into the market right</text>
  <text start="634.269" dur="4.981">now I&amp;#39;m telling you right now this</text>

  <text start="687.43" dur="6.659">we can see they&amp;#39;re moving forward by</text>
  <text start="691.42" dur="4.38">bypassing the dollar we</text>
  <text start="694.089" dur="3.391">see that they don&amp;#39;t want to have</text>
  <text start="695.8" dur="4.259">anything to do with the dollar at this</text>
  <text start="697.48" dur="5.13">point and there&amp;#39;s a reason for this</text>
  <text start="700.059" dur="7.921">because when we look at the entire</text>
  <text start="702.61" dur="8.25">situation we see that this economy and</text>
  <text start="707.98" dur="5.519">there are many people coming out at this</text>
  <text start="710.86" dur="5.519">point saying this economy is not going</text>
  <text start="713.499" dur="5.58">to make it through the fall maybe early</text>
  <text start="716.379" dur="5.7">2017 depending on how this whole thing</text>
  <text start="719.079" dur="6.18">falls apart but we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="722.079" dur="6.48">that everything that the government</text>
  <text start="725.259" dur="6">employees have been telling us all their</text>
  <text start="728.559" dur="5.97">predictions on how well the economy was</text>
  <text start="731.259" dur="7.2">going to be doing all turned out to be</text>
