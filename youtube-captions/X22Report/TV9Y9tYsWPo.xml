  <text start="398.07" dur="6.84">bubble is about to pop in the real</text>
  <text start="401.07" dur="6.15">estate market and as we exit the summer</text>
  <text start="404.91" dur="3.89">season you&amp;#39;re gonna see things really</text>
  <text start="407.22" dur="3.78">start to fall apart you&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>

  <text start="414.33" dur="3.75">mortgage applications and the rest</text>
  <text start="415.86" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re gonna decline because as we know</text>
  <text start="418.08" dur="8.04">what is happening the Fed is raising the</text>
  <text start="421.5" dur="8.82">rates having high prices having rates</text>
  <text start="426.12" dur="5.94">move up this is a disaster in the making</text>
  <text start="430.32" dur="3.33">because what happens when prices</text>
  <text start="432.06" dur="3.03">continually move up even though they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="433.65" dur="4.95">falling right now they&amp;#39;re at a very very</text>
  <text start="435.09" dur="5.64">high point and you raise the rates well</text>
  <text start="438.6" dur="4.68">it kicks a lot of people out of the</text>
  <text start="440.73" dur="4.92">market and this is why we see mortgage</text>
  <text start="443.28" dur="4.86">applications declining refinancing</text>
  <text start="445.65" dur="5.49">applications declining this will</text>
  <text start="448.14" dur="4.44">continue and as those decline because</text>
  <text start="451.14" dur="2">we&amp;#39;re kicking a lot more people out of</text>
  <text start="452.58" dur="3.65">the market</text>
  <text start="453.14" dur="5.16">traffic is going to dry up in the real</text>
  <text start="456.23" dur="3.74">estate market that means people are</text>
  <text start="458.3" dur="4.59">gonna have to lower their prices and</text>
  <text start="459.97" dur="4.81">guess what people are going to wait on</text>
  <text start="462.89" dur="3.93">the sidelines because interest rates are</text>
  <text start="464.78" dur="3.24">gonna continually move up prices are</text>
  <text start="466.82" dur="3.39">gonna come down and people gonna wait</text>
  <text start="468.02" dur="5.43">well let&amp;#39;s see how far they come down</text>
  <text start="470.21" dur="4.92">and then all of a sudden people start</text>
  <text start="473.45" dur="4.86">taking their houses off the market and</text>
  <text start="475.13" dur="5.93">this whole things really implodes on</text>
  <text start="478.31" dur="6.15">itself this is what happened in 2008</text>
  <text start="481.06" dur="6.67">prior to 2008 actually we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="484.46" dur="4.98">same thing occur right now now the IMF</text>
  <text start="487.73" dur="5.01">as we know they have warned that Trump</text>
  <text start="489.44" dur="6.45">his trade wars could cost about 430</text>
  <text start="492.74" dur="5.43">billion to the global economy and the</text>
  <text start="495.89" dur="5.82">World Economic Outlook report states</text>
  <text start="498.17" dur="7.8">that the US could find itself the focus</text>
  <text start="501.71" dur="6.21">of a global retaliation the IMF warns</text>
  <text start="505.97" dur="3.45">that with the threats of the US and</text>
  <text start="507.92" dur="5.03">trading partners it could lead to a</text>
  <text start="509.42" dur="6.48">lowering of global growth of up to 0.5%</text>
  <text start="512.95" dur="5.41">all global economies would suffer</text>
  <text start="515.9" dur="4.74">however the u.s. one might be charged</text>
  <text start="518.36" dur="5.46">with significantly higher share of its</text>
  <text start="520.64" dur="6.39">exports being taxed globally now this</text>
  <text start="523.82" dur="5.58">warning comes after Trump proposed a 10</text>
  <text start="527.03" dur="4.47">percent tariff on around 200 billion in</text>
  <text start="529.4" dur="6.93">Chinese goods coming after the previous</text>
  <text start="531.5" dur="6.84">25 percent duties so basically what is</text>
  <text start="536.33" dur="4.47">happening here is that the central</text>
  <text start="538.34" dur="4.65">bankers they are warning that if Trump</text>
  <text start="540.8" dur="5.97">continually does this it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="542.99" dur="6.69">wreck their system and this is what</text>
  <text start="546.77" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re most afraid of remember we have</text>
  <text start="549.68" dur="6">NAFTA we have the World Trade</text>
  <text start="553.16" dur="5.28">Organization TPP is struck down we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="555.68" dur="5.58">negotiations for the North American Free</text>
  <text start="558.44" dur="4.59">Trade Agreement and these talks are kind</text>
  <text start="561.26" dur="4.02">of stalled right now actually Trump just</text>
  <text start="563.03" dur="3.81">wanted to get rid of them and of course</text>
  <text start="565.28" dur="3.18">that&amp;#39;s very difficult because it has to</text>
  <text start="566.84" dur="3.72">go back to Congress they have to vote on</text>
  <text start="568.46" dur="4.74">it almost like Obamacare and that is</text>
  <text start="570.56" dur="4.56">very difficult to do so what is Trump</text>
  <text start="573.2" dur="4.83">doing and we mentioned this before he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="575.12" dur="6.06">setting up bilateral trade deals</text>
  <text start="578.03" dur="5.07">this is decentralization the World Trade</text>
  <text start="581.18" dur="4.65">Organization is centralized</text>
  <text start="583.1" dur="5.55">he&amp;#39;s decentralizing right now</text>
  <text start="585.83" dur="4.55">once you are fully decentralized you can</text>
  <text start="588.65" dur="5.55">get rid of the centralization</text>
  <text start="590.38" dur="6.19">organization and I believe this is where</text>
  <text start="594.2" dur="5.1">he is headed with all this and this is</text>
  <text start="596.57" dur="6.39">his strategy now let&amp;#39;s take a closer</text>
  <text start="599.3" dur="6.21">look at these tariffs and see what Trump</text>
  <text start="602.96" dur="4.68">is actually doing here now Trump is</text>
  <text start="605.51" dur="5.7">going after products with a robust</text>
  <text start="607.64" dur="6.72">import numbers but with less impact on</text>
  <text start="611.21" dur="6.33">ordinary Americans so let&amp;#39;s take a look</text>
  <text start="614.36" dur="5.75">at Cosmetics cosmetics well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="617.54" dur="6.36">low-impact combined with a big punch</text>

  <text start="718.04" dur="4.98">doing is</text>
  <text start="719.6" dur="6.3">giving us a level playing field</text>
  <text start="723.02" dur="5.16">it&amp;#39;s funny when tariffs were hit on the</text>
  <text start="725.9" dur="4.77">US with u.s. products going into other</text>
  <text start="728.18" dur="4.5">countries nobody really you know said</text>
  <text start="730.67" dur="3.66">anything it wasn&amp;#39;t really a big deal but</text>
  <text start="732.68" dur="6">the opposite way people are going crazy</text>
  <text start="734.33" dur="6.57">why because the system was set up not to</text>

  <text start="750.89" dur="3.42">doing is they were moving everything out</text>
  <text start="752.75" dur="3.57">of the United States moving</text>
  <text start="754.31" dur="6.63">manufacturing out moving everything out</text>

  <text start="760.94" dur="6.99">reverse everything well this reverses</text>
  <text start="764.72" dur="6.74">their plan this reverses everything that</text>
  <text start="767.93" dur="7.23">they were trying to do and it allows</text>
  <text start="771.46" dur="7.39">manufacturing to compete which means</text>
  <text start="775.16" dur="7.35">other manufacturers might and this is</text>
  <text start="778.85" dur="5.1">the long-range plan here might come back</text>
  <text start="782.51" dur="3.72">to the United States I mean this is the</text>
  <text start="783.95" dur="5.43">beginning stages but you have to lay the</text>
  <text start="786.23" dur="6.63">foundation to bring everything back and</text>
  <text start="789.38" dur="5.1">you have to undo everything the central</text>
  <text start="792.86" dur="3.78">bankers have been doing the</text>
  <text start="794.48" dur="5.01">establishment in doing and this is what</text>
  <text start="796.64" dur="5.52">is in process right now we see the Fed</text>
  <text start="799.49" dur="4.35">chair Powell he is out there telling us</text>
  <text start="802.16" dur="3.87">how great the economy&amp;#39;s doing and of</text>
  <text start="803.84" dur="4.59">course the one thing he&amp;#39;s not sure of is</text>
  <text start="806.03" dur="4.05">the tax and spending policies the</text>
  <text start="808.43" dur="3.21">tariffs and things like that he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="810.08" dur="4.5">know how that&amp;#39;s going to affect the</text>
  <text start="811.64" dur="4.8">economy but once again according to the</text>
  <text start="814.58" dur="4.23">Fed what they&amp;#39;re saying is that</text>
  <text start="816.44" dur="4.71">inflation is right on track the labor</text>
  <text start="818.81" dur="5.4">market is strong everything that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="821.15" dur="5.4">doing seems to be working and the</text>
  <text start="824.21" dur="3.54">economy seems to be very very strong and</text>
  <text start="826.55" dur="2.84">it looks like what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="827.75" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re setting this all up once again</text>
  <text start="829.39" dur="4.87">they&amp;#39;re laying down the narrative of</text>
  <text start="831.89" dur="6.87">everything that they&amp;#39;ve been doing is</text>
  <text start="834.26" dur="7.2">great we&amp;#39;re unsure of the taxes the</text>
  <text start="838.76" dur="4.89">spending policy the tariffs we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="841.46" dur="5.1">know how that&amp;#39;s going to affect the</text>
  <text start="843.65" dur="6.93">economy and once again this is a</text>
  <text start="846.56" dur="6.31">complete and utter setup to control the</text>
  <text start="850.58" dur="4.3">narrative and we</text>
  <text start="852.87" dur="4.35">see right now this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="854.88" dur="4.14">trying to do they&amp;#39;re trying to create</text>
  <text start="857.22" dur="4.38">this narrative tell us that everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="859.02" dur="4.2">on track everything is going exactly the</text>
  <text start="861.6" dur="4.47">way they want and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="863.22" dur="4.68">continually raise interest rates and we</text>
  <text start="866.07" dur="4.11">know what&amp;#39;s going to happen when they</text>
  <text start="867.9" dur="3.93">raise interest rates things are going to</text>
  <text start="870.18" dur="4.8">start to fall apart and as they raise</text>
  <text start="871.83" dur="5.67">them more and more each time this will</text>
  <text start="874.98" dur="4.89">accelerate so they&amp;#39;re covering their</text>
  <text start="877.5" dur="6.12">tracks they&amp;#39;re already laying the</text>
  <text start="879.87" dur="5.82">breadcrumbs of why the tariffs and the</text>
  <text start="883.62" dur="3.9">taxes and everything else why that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="885.69" dur="4.649">going to have a negative effect on the</text>
  <text start="887.52" dur="4.44">economy where they can&amp;#39;t predict how</text>
  <text start="890.339" dur="3.901">that&amp;#39;s going to affect the economy so</text>
  <text start="891.96" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re already putting the word out</text>
  <text start="894.24" dur="2.43">there and we already see what the</text>
  <text start="895.47" dur="3.21">mainstream media and everything else</text>
  <text start="896.67" dur="5.25">that they&amp;#39;re also moving in this</text>
  <text start="898.68" dur="5.28">direction so we&amp;#39;re at the end stage here</text>
  <text start="901.92" dur="3.57">especially with housing and once housing</text>
  <text start="903.96" dur="3">gets hit we know that&amp;#39;s going to have a</text>
  <text start="905.49" dur="4.59">ripple effect in too many other things</text>
  <text start="906.96" dur="4.77">especially once it has ins globally we</text>
  <text start="910.08" dur="4.08">see the mainstream media we see the Fed</text>
  <text start="911.73" dur="4.62">we see the rest they&amp;#39;re laying the</text>

  <text start="916.35" dur="6.359">we are at a point of no return right now</text>
  <text start="919.38" dur="6.78">and we are going to head down this path</text>
