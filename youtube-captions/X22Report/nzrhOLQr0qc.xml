  <text start="101.679" dur="7.08">to inspect their servers instead they</text>
  <text start="106.3" dur="4.05">used a Google funded cybersecurity firm</text>
  <text start="108.759" dur="5.341">called CrowdStrike</text>
  <text start="110.35" dur="6.72">which FBI director James Comey referred</text>

  <text start="121.659" dur="5.911">on their analysis now CrowdStrike</text>
  <text start="125.229" dur="4.381">was accused of using false information</text>
  <text start="127.57" dur="3.66">by the government of Ukraine in a</text>
  <text start="129.61" dur="4.62">separate December report which concluded</text>

  <text start="150.79" dur="6.21">the DNC&amp;#39;s refusal to let the FBI inspect</text>
  <text start="153.85" dur="6.72">the servers well don&amp;#39;t you think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="157" dur="5.16">a problem here the FBI really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="160.57" dur="4.919">investigate at all</text>
  <text start="162.16" dur="6.62">now Lee Stranahan had planned to bring</text>
  <text start="165.489" dur="6.331">up the issue with Sean Spicer and</text>
  <text start="168.78" dur="5.62">Matthew Boyle Breitbart DC political</text>
  <text start="171.82" dur="4.71">editor ordered Stranahan to stand down</text>
  <text start="174.4" dur="4.589">and stay away from the White House now</text>
  <text start="176.53" dur="4.53">the question is why why didn&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="178.989" dur="3.061">allow him to ask this question because</text>
  <text start="181.06" dur="2.31">when you look at the</text>
  <text start="182.05" dur="3.3">evidence and you look at what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="183.37" dur="4.83">going on the FBI never even looked at</text>
  <text start="185.35" dur="4.02">the servers this should be investigated</text>
  <text start="188.2" dur="3.24">I mean they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="189.37" dur="4.23">investigating everything else but when</text>
  <text start="191.44" dur="4.2">there&amp;#39;s actually a crime or something</text>
  <text start="193.6" dur="4.47">going wrong the FBI just says well I</text>
  <text start="195.64" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t see it and it&amp;#39;s just amazing how</text>
  <text start="198.07" dur="4.17">this is all being played out here and</text>
  <text start="200.29" dur="4.85">you can see that the deep state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="202.24" dur="6.24">controlling all of this now we</text>
  <text start="205.14" dur="5.47">understand that the deep state they want</text>
  <text start="208.48" dur="3.3">control of the information you can see</text>
  <text start="210.61" dur="3.6">that they&amp;#39;re controlling everything else</text>
  <text start="211.78" dur="5.16">that&amp;#39;s the one thing that they that</text>
  <text start="214.21" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re trying to get is control of the</text>
  <text start="216.94" dur="4.32">Internet the alternative media those</text>
  <text start="218.92" dur="5.01">individuals that are speaking out and it</text>
  <text start="221.26" dur="6.23">looks like Google YouTube they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="223.93" dur="7.02">starting this new policy of looking for</text>
  <text start="227.49" dur="6.28">offensive YouTube channels offensive</text>
  <text start="230.95" dur="6.15">websites and they&amp;#39;re going to be hiring</text>
  <text start="233.77" dur="7.26">individuals to take a look to see if</text>
  <text start="237.1" dur="6.72">those sites or the channels are</text>
  <text start="241.03" dur="6.33">offensive now these people are going to</text>
  <text start="243.82" dur="5.31">be called quality raters now what are</text>
  <text start="247.36" dur="3.66">they going to use to gauge what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="249.13" dur="3.66">offensive because what&amp;#39;s offensive to</text>
  <text start="251.02" dur="4.11">one person is not offensive to another</text>
  <text start="252.79" dur="4.71">and what offensive to one religion is</text>
  <text start="255.13" dur="4.62">not offensive to another religion so I</text>
  <text start="257.5" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t know how they&amp;#39;re going to do this</text>
  <text start="259.75" dur="5.669">but you can see right now that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="261.97" dur="6.18">going to use this to censor certain</text>
  <text start="265.419" dur="4.291">channels certain web sites and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="268.15" dur="4.35">going to have to see how this plays out</text>
  <text start="269.71" dur="7.25">because we can see right now that this</text>
  <text start="272.5" dur="9.09">most likely will be a way for them to</text>
  <text start="276.96" dur="8.32">hide and basically censor everything</text>
  <text start="281.59" dur="6.17">that goes against the deep state and</text>
  <text start="285.28" dur="6.06">this is where we are headed right now</text>
  <text start="287.76" dur="6.28">now during the Comey and Mike Rogers</text>
  <text start="291.34" dur="5.76">hearing we heard many different things a</text>
  <text start="294.04" dur="4.71">lot of it not based on any type of fact</text>
  <text start="297.1" dur="5.55">or anything like that and they brought</text>
  <text start="298.75" dur="6.78">up Manafort ties to Russia where he was</text>
  <text start="302.65" dur="5.34">dealing with a company he was signed on</text>
  <text start="305.53" dur="5.61">with a 10 million annual contract</text>
  <text start="307.99" dur="6.72">beginning in 2006 and he maintained a</text>
  <text start="311.14" dur="4.859">business relationship until 2009 now a</text>
  <text start="314.71" dur="5.159">spokeswoman for</text>
  <text start="315.999" dur="6.99">Russian billionaire Deripaska responded</text>
  <text start="319.869" dur="5.73">to all of this saying that we did not</text>
  <text start="322.989" dur="4.56">pay man afford for the Russia related</text>
  <text start="325.599" dur="4.98">work she adds that there was only an</text>
  <text start="327.549" dur="4.68">agreement between mr. Deripaska and mr.</text>
  <text start="330.579" dur="3.54">man afford to provide investment</text>
  <text start="332.229" dur="4.98">consulting services related to business</text>
  <text start="334.119" dur="5.7">interests of mr. Deripaska which now is</text>
  <text start="337.209" dur="5.01">a subject to legal claims additionally</text>
  <text start="339.819" dur="5.07">she denied a peace report that Deripaska</text>
  <text start="342.219" dur="5.76">paid Paul Madoff work to work to improve</text>
  <text start="344.889" dur="5.52">Russia&amp;#39;s image in 2005 and we know that</text>
  <text start="347.979" dur="5.22">John Podesta&amp;#39;s brother Tony Podesta well</text>
  <text start="350.409" dur="3.33">he did receive a contract with Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="353.199" dur="4.02">bank</text>
  <text start="353.739" dur="6.75">Zuber bank to lobby its interests in the</text>
  <text start="357.219" dur="5.43">United States and what Manafort did was</text>
  <text start="360.489" dur="4.71">nothing more than pure work and image</text>
  <text start="362.649" dur="5.43">consulting for a Russian oligarch over a</text>
  <text start="365.199" dur="4.89">decade ago is this any different than</text>
  <text start="368.079" dur="4.77">what Tony Podesta did the brother of</text>
  <text start="370.089" dur="6.33">Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s campaign manager John</text>
  <text start="372.849" dur="4.65">Podesta no it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just business but</text>
  <text start="376.419" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re trying to make it into something</text>
  <text start="377.499" dur="5.85">much larger than it really is because</text>
  <text start="379.629" dur="6.18">they really have nothing now during the</text>
  <text start="383.349" dur="4.35">hearings of Comey and Mike Rogers they</text>
  <text start="385.809" dur="3.54">brought up the subject of wiretapping I</text>
  <text start="387.699" dur="3.36">mean they brought up many other subjects</text>
  <text start="389.349" dur="4.62">but one of them was wiretapping and</text>
  <text start="391.059" dur="6.03">James Comey was out there saying that he</text>
  <text start="393.969" dur="8.04">looked within the FBI and didn&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="397.089" dur="6.03">anything in there no legal documentation</text>
  <text start="402.009" dur="3.96">or anything like that</text>
  <text start="403.119" dur="5.61">within the FBI he chose he chose his</text>
  <text start="405.969" dur="6.21">words very very carefully to make sure</text>
  <text start="408.729" dur="7.02">he said within the FBI so today we find</text>
  <text start="412.179" dur="5.73">out coming from Devon nanase that he was</text>
  <text start="415.749" dur="4.71">provided an intelligence report brought</text>
  <text start="417.909" dur="4.74">to him by an unnamed source includes</text>
  <text start="420.459" dur="3.72">significant information about Trump and</text>
  <text start="422.649" dur="3.33">his transition team now</text>
  <text start="424.179" dur="4.2">he said the information was legally</text>
  <text start="425.979" dur="4.46">brought to me by sources who thought we</text>
  <text start="428.379" dur="4.77">should know it that&amp;#39;s what he said and</text>
  <text start="430.439" dur="5.47">what it said was on numerous occasions</text>
  <text start="433.149" dur="4.65">the intelligence community incidentally</text>
  <text start="435.909" dur="3.81">collected information about u.s.</text>
  <text start="437.799" dur="4.95">citizens involved in the Trump</text>
  <text start="439.719" dur="4.23">transition details about u.s. persons</text>
  <text start="442.749" dur="3.39">associated with the incoming</text>
  <text start="443.949" dur="4.08">administration details with little or no</text>
  <text start="446.139" dur="3.631">apparent foreign intelligence value were</text>
  <text start="448.029" dur="4.651">widely disseminated</text>
  <text start="449.77" dur="5.549">intelligence community reporting third I</text>
  <text start="452.68" dur="4.95">have confirmed that additional names of</text>
  <text start="455.319" dur="4.051">Trump transition members were unmasked</text>
  <text start="457.63" dur="5.46">remember during the hearings they talked</text>
  <text start="459.37" dur="5.31">about masks and unmasked individuals and</text>
  <text start="463.09" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s only a certain number of people</text>
  <text start="464.68" dur="5.43">that can unmask these people forth and</text>
  <text start="467.59" dur="4.59">finally I want to be clear none of this</text>
  <text start="470.11" dur="4.29">surveillance was related to Russia or</text>
  <text start="472.18" dur="5.25">the investigation of Russian activity or</text>
  <text start="474.4" dur="5.07">of the Trump team the House Intelligence</text>
  <text start="477.43" dur="3.87">Committee will thoroughly investigate</text>
  <text start="479.47" dur="3.9">surveillance and its subsequent</text>
  <text start="481.3" dur="4.89">dissemination determined a few things</text>
  <text start="483.37" dur="5.91">here that I want to read off who was</text>
  <text start="486.19" dur="6.03">aware of it why it was not disclosed to</text>
  <text start="489.28" dur="5.52">Congress who requested and authorized</text>
  <text start="492.22" dur="4.59">the additional unmasking whether anyone</text>
  <text start="494.8" dur="4.26">directed the intelligence community to</text>
  <text start="496.81" dur="4.169">focus on Trump associates and whether</text>
  <text start="499.06" dur="4.229">any laws regulations or procedures were</text>
  <text start="500.979" dur="5.97">violated I have asked the directors of</text>
  <text start="503.289" dur="5.461">the FBI NSA CIA to expeditiously comply</text>
  <text start="506.949" dur="3.481">with the March 15th letter that you all</text>
  <text start="508.75" dur="3.15">received a couple weeks ago and to</text>
  <text start="510.43" dur="4.229">provide a full account of these</text>
  <text start="511.9" dur="5.55">surveillance activities as what Nunez</text>
  <text start="514.659" dur="3.481">has said now we have to think about this</text>
  <text start="517.45" dur="4.649">for a second</text>
  <text start="518.14" dur="5.97">we know that they unmasked Flynn Flynn</text>
  <text start="522.099" dur="5.271">was part of Trump&amp;#39;s transition team</text>
  <text start="524.11" dur="6.75">which shows that yes they were</text>
  <text start="527.37" dur="6.58">surveilling his team which it turns out</text>
  <text start="530.86" dur="5.7">to be true and coming from trey Gowdy</text>
  <text start="533.95" dur="5.52">and we discussed this before he took</text>
  <text start="536.56" dur="5.1">Comey and said listen how many people</text>
  <text start="539.47" dur="4.83">have the ability to unmask individuals</text>
  <text start="541.66" dur="5.52">and he went down at the time Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.3" dur="6.15">Attorney General can Obama do it can</text>
  <text start="547.18" dur="5.27">James clapper do it and this was all yes</text>
  <text start="550.45" dur="5.31">to all these questions so these</text>
  <text start="552.45" dur="5.02">individuals had the ability and they</text>
  <text start="555.76" dur="4.86">knew what was going on</text>
  <text start="557.47" dur="5.58">so Trump was right he was under</text>
  <text start="560.62" dur="4.83">surveillance and people were looking for</text>
  <text start="563.05" dur="3.99">something guess what they couldn&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="565.45" dur="4.53">it that&amp;#39;s why they didn&amp;#39;t use it the</text>
  <text start="567.04" dur="6.33">only thing they had was Flynn speaking</text>
  <text start="569.98" dur="5.97">to the Russian ambassador and from the</text>
  <text start="573.37" dur="4.74">recordings he really didn&amp;#39;t say anything</text>
  <text start="575.95" dur="4.56">I think they jumped the gun I think he</text>
  <text start="578.11" dur="5.099">resigned too quickly but we can see</text>
  <text start="580.51" dur="3.18">right now he was unmasked it&amp;#39;s against</text>
  <text start="583.209" dur="3.571">the law</text>
  <text start="583.69" dur="6.54">law that individual or individuals that</text>
  <text start="586.78" dur="5.61">unmask him well they should be put into</text>
  <text start="590.23" dur="5.15">prison because that is what the law says</text>
  <text start="592.39" dur="5.28">the other individuals that unmask other</text>
  <text start="595.38" dur="5.17">people in the Trump transition team</text>
  <text start="597.67" dur="4.86">those people also broke the law now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="600.55" dur="5.94">amazing that there was a crime committed</text>
  <text start="602.53" dur="5.97">and the FBI and the Department of</text>
  <text start="606.49" dur="4.05">Justice and the rest aren&amp;#39;t saying we</text>
  <text start="608.5" dur="3.84">need to investigate this we need to find</text>
  <text start="610.54" dur="4.2">out who these people are</text>
  <text start="612.34" dur="3.75">I know Nunez is trying to figure this</text>
  <text start="614.74" dur="4.23">out with the questions that he&amp;#39;s asked</text>
  <text start="616.09" dur="6.12">but we can see right now what Trump has</text>
  <text start="618.97" dur="6.33">said well it&amp;#39;s coming true now we know</text>
  <text start="622.21" dur="6.72">that judge now Pathan Oh was let go of</text>
  <text start="625.3" dur="8.19">Fox News because he mentioned that GCHQ</text>
  <text start="628.93" dur="8.07">was handing off information to Obama to</text>
  <text start="633.49" dur="7.89">spy on Trump and according to a new NACE</text>
  <text start="637" dur="8.85">this might be true because it turns out</text>
  <text start="641.38" dur="6.99">that information was sent to a foreign</text>
  <text start="645.85" dur="5.73">body didn&amp;#39;t name the foreign body right</text>
  <text start="648.37" dur="7.67">now and Judge Napolitano said he had</text>
  <text start="651.58" dur="7.67">different sources that confirmed it was</text>
  <text start="656.04" dur="7.66">GCHQ we also know that the director of</text>
  <text start="659.25" dur="7.06">GCHQ just resigned how coincidental and</text>
  <text start="663.7" dur="5.07">we see right now that all of this is</text>
  <text start="666.31" dur="4.38">coming up now Judge novel tunnel source</text>
  <text start="668.77" dur="3.54">was former intelligence officer fishel</text>
  <text start="670.69" dur="5.22">Larry Johnson who said in an interview</text>
  <text start="672.31" dur="5.58">on CNN when Trump tweeted what he did on</text>
  <text start="675.91" dur="4.44">Saturday two weeks ago the next day I</text>
  <text start="677.89" dur="4.17">was interviewed on Russia Today now I</text>
  <text start="680.35" dur="4.68">had known about the fact the British</text>
  <text start="682.06" dur="5.43">through gchq were passing information</text>
  <text start="685.03" dur="4.26">through back channels but it was being</text>
  <text start="687.49" dur="5.79">done with the full knowledge of people</text>

  <text start="1133.52" dur="6.42">trying to remove them all now today we</text>
  <text start="1136.28" dur="5.43">had this event out in London and of</text>
  <text start="1139.94" dur="3.63">course in the beginning they said there</text>
  <text start="1141.71" dur="5.969">is this Asian man that&amp;#39;s running around</text>
  <text start="1143.57" dur="8.01">stabbing people ran people over in his</text>

  <text start="1153.65" dur="6.21">his name was Trevor Brooks he&amp;#39;s from</text>

  <text start="1168.86" dur="6.99">now 20 people are injured and it looks</text>
  <text start="1172.37" dur="5.82">like four people were killed and we can</text>
  <text start="1175.85" dur="6.15">see right now that this event occurred</text>
  <text start="1178.19" dur="7.05">exactly the same time the information</text>
  <text start="1182" dur="6.63">about Trump surveillance came out now it</text>
  <text start="1185.24" dur="6.66">just coincidental that these two things</text>
  <text start="1188.63" dur="6.929">just so happened at the exact same time</text>
  <text start="1191.9" dur="5.58">and we can see right now that there&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1197.48" dur="5.61">article 50 so all of this is happening</text>
  <text start="1200.21" dur="5.49">at the same time but I find it a huge</text>
  <text start="1203.09" dur="5.31">distraction from what would have been</text>
  <text start="1205.7" dur="5.91">the headline news to this event it seems</text>
  <text start="1208.4" dur="6.24">to me that it was kind of timed</text>
  <text start="1211.61" dur="4.77">perfectly to show that Trump was</text>
  <text start="1214.64" dur="3">actually under surveillance</text>
  <text start="1216.38" dur="4.289">but they didn&amp;#39;t want that information</text>
  <text start="1217.64" dur="5.88">hitting the front page now on CNN they</text>
  <text start="1220.669" dur="4.651">did put the surveillance story on the</text>
  <text start="1223.52" dur="5.64">front page and then it was quickly</text>
  <text start="1225.32" dur="7.29">taking down as soon as the event hit so</text>
  <text start="1229.16" dur="7.56">it looks like to me this was set up as a</text>
  <text start="1232.61" dur="6.51">complete distraction and there might be</text>
  <text start="1236.72" dur="4.709">other agendas associated with this maybe</text>
  <text start="1239.12" dur="4.02">article 50 trying to distract everyone</text>
