  <text start="58.45" dur="6.96">episode 1557 a and today&amp;#39;s date is May</text>
  <text start="62.29" dur="5.97">1st 2018 and the top of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.41" dur="5.94">both sides wait for the other to make a</text>
  <text start="68.26" dur="5.76">move on the economy let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="71.35" dur="5.28">economic collapse financial news now we</text>
  <text start="74.02" dur="6.11">know around the world the housing market</text>
  <text start="76.63" dur="6.51">well it is basically falling apart and</text>
  <text start="80.13" dur="4.96">we&amp;#39;re seeing signs in many different</text>
  <text start="83.14" dur="4.56">countries not just the United States but</text>
  <text start="85.09" dur="5.76">other countries we&amp;#39;ve also seen signs</text>
  <text start="87.7" dur="6.15">where the Fed has pushed inflation to</text>
  <text start="90.85" dur="5.909">other parts of the world and I believe</text>
  <text start="93.85" dur="4.74">that one of these places is Canada</text>
  <text start="96.759" dur="4.291">because we&amp;#39;ve been seeing this housing</text>
  <text start="98.59" dur="5.04">bubble being pumped up pumped up and all</text>
  <text start="101.05" dur="5.97">of a sudden right now Canada is in</text>
  <text start="103.63" dur="6.18">serious trouble and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="107.02" dur="4.62">right now is that the moment of truth</text>
  <text start="109.81" dur="5.55">for Canada&amp;#39;s all-important housing</text>
  <text start="111.64" dur="7.26">market is at hand and the reason for</text>
  <text start="115.36" dur="7.799">this is because well we can see rates</text>
  <text start="118.9" dur="8.97">are rising banks have been pushing up</text>
  <text start="123.159" dur="7.561">mortgage rates and we see also that a</text>
  <text start="127.87" dur="6.899">lot of the mortgages they are coming due</text>
  <text start="130.72" dur="7.2">and this is going to be a huge problem</text>
  <text start="134.769" dur="6.361">and this is also pushing a lot of</text>
  <text start="137.92" dur="7.289">individuals out of the market now the</text>
  <text start="141.13" dur="7.169">economy has never been as levered as it</text>
  <text start="145.209" dur="5.701">currently is in the economy is far more</text>
  <text start="148.299" dur="4.47">interest sensitive than has been in the</text>
  <text start="150.91" dur="4.59">past to a degree that we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="152.769" dur="4.921">certainty over how each interest rate</text>
  <text start="155.5" dur="5.37">hike is going to affect Canadian</text>
  <text start="157.69" dur="5.97">consumers all we know is it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="160.87" dur="6.29">be very painful when everything starts</text>
  <text start="163.66" dur="5.85">to completely fall apart and here&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="167.16" dur="4">Canada will no longer be able to avoid</text>
  <text start="169.51" dur="4.38">the troubling reality of rising rates</text>
  <text start="171.16" dur="7.109">the country is entering a period in</text>
  <text start="173.89" dur="6.45">which no less than 47% of existing</text>
  <text start="178.269" dur="7.44">mortgages need to be refinanced this</text>
  <text start="180.34" dur="7.399">year verses 25 to 35% typically and the</text>
  <text start="185.709" dur="5.401">pain for Canadian homeowners</text>
  <text start="187.739" dur="6.28">appears unavoidable now according to</text>
  <text start="191.11" dur="6.39">Statistics Canada total payments on debt</text>
  <text start="194.019" dur="5.761">made by the Canadian household rose by</text>
  <text start="197.5" dur="4.23">6.7 percent in the fourth quarter from a</text>
  <text start="199.78" dur="5.459">year earlier and the interest paid</text>
  <text start="201.73" dur="5.85">component climbed 9.2 percent those were</text>
  <text start="205.239" dur="6.571">the biggest gains since the financial</text>
  <text start="207.58" dur="7.59">crisis and if we look at the UK we can</text>
  <text start="211.81" dur="7.23">see we have problems there homeownership</text>
  <text start="215.17" dur="6.36">rate for Millennials aged 25 to 34 has</text>
  <text start="219.04" dur="3.99">nearly halved in some of the regions of</text>
  <text start="221.53" dur="4.2">Britain showing that the housing</text>
  <text start="223.03" dur="6.209">affordability crisis extends far beyond</text>
  <text start="225.73" dur="5.009">the boundaries of London again what</text>
  <text start="229.239" dur="3.89">they&amp;#39;ve done was they created these</text>
  <text start="230.739" dur="4.47">gigantic bubbles they pumped it up and</text>
  <text start="233.129" dur="6.011">wages they haven&amp;#39;t kept up with</text>
  <text start="235.209" dur="5.521">inflation on housing and it pushed a lot</text>
  <text start="239.14" dur="3.87">of people out of the market now as you</text>
  <text start="240.73" dur="4.86">raise interest rates even more people</text>
  <text start="243.01" dur="5.67">are being pushed out of the market and</text>
  <text start="245.59" dur="6.119">this is why we said here in the United</text>
  <text start="248.68" dur="6.36">States Fannie and Freddie they decided</text>
  <text start="251.709" dur="5.161">to basically take the 3% mortgage down</text>
  <text start="255.04" dur="4.86">and do a no income check because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="256.87" dur="4.679">trying to bring as many people into the</text>
  <text start="259.9" dur="3.389">housing market before the whole thing</text>
  <text start="261.549" dur="3.391">completely falls apart because what do</text>
  <text start="263.289" dur="5.491">these people need to do right now they</text>
  <text start="264.94" dur="4.62">need to unload their real estate this is</text>
  <text start="268.78" dur="2.609">what happens</text>
  <text start="269.56" dur="3.03">they sell when it&amp;#39;s very high they buy</text>
  <text start="271.389" dur="3.021">when it&amp;#39;s really cheap</text>
  <text start="272.59" dur="4.699">they sell when it&amp;#39;s very high and</text>
  <text start="274.41" dur="5.02">basically they unload it right before</text>
  <text start="277.289" dur="3.491">everything starts to fall apart it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="279.43" dur="4.2">almost the same as the stock market</text>
  <text start="280.78" dur="5.28">where those institutional investors the</text>
  <text start="283.63" dur="4.11">insiders they know they&amp;#39;re pumping it up</text>
  <text start="286.06" dur="3.39">pumping it up and when it reaches a</text>
  <text start="287.74" dur="3.51">certain point they want all the retail</text>
  <text start="289.45" dur="3.42">investors in saying Liz&amp;#39;s gonna go</text>
  <text start="291.25" dur="3.72">higher it&amp;#39;s gonna hit a hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="292.87" dur="3.84">everyone get in now and they unload</text>
  <text start="294.97" dur="4.44">their stocks they make their profits and</text>
  <text start="296.71" dur="4.05">the rest of the people they get into the</text>
  <text start="299.41" dur="5.31">market they buy their stocks and</text>
  <text start="300.76" dur="6.21">everything starts to fall apart and out</text>
  <text start="304.72" dur="3.509">in Britain there was a report that was</text>
  <text start="306.97" dur="3.93">conducted over two years an</text>
  <text start="308.229" dur="6.631">investigation into the intergenerational</text>
  <text start="310.9" dur="6.69">fairness in Britain and the think tank</text>
  <text start="314.86" dur="4.44">Resolution Foundation which was directed</text>
  <text start="317.59" dur="2.8">by former University&amp;#39;s Minister David</text>
  <text start="319.3" dur="3.31">Willetts the</text>
  <text start="320.39" dur="4.65">team discovered that overpriced homes in</text>
  <text start="322.61" dur="4.65">Britain had forced Millennials into</text>
  <text start="325.04" dur="4.65">increasingly cramped and expensive</text>
  <text start="327.26" dur="4.77">rented properties that leave them with a</text>
  <text start="329.69" dur="5.91">longer commute and little chance for</text>
  <text start="332.03" dur="6.36">saving for a home and it shows that the</text>
  <text start="335.6" dur="4.89">homeownership is collapsing there and</text>
  <text start="338.39" dur="3.27">there&amp;#39;s a problem in Canada there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="340.49" dur="3.66">problem in the United States is a</text>
  <text start="341.66" dur="6.24">problem throughout Europe the whole</text>
  <text start="344.15" dur="5.94">thing is one gigantic bubble and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="347.9" dur="5.58">getting ready to pop now here in the</text>
  <text start="350.09" dur="6.57">United States the US economic expansion</text>
  <text start="353.48" dur="5.79">now becomes the outright second longest</text>
  <text start="356.66" dur="4.74">in history with data going back over a</text>
  <text start="359.27" dur="5.03">hundred and sixty vars sixty-four years</text>
  <text start="361.4" dur="5.49">and thirty-four business cycles</text>
  <text start="364.3" dur="5.11">according to Deutsche Bank&amp;#39;s calculation</text>
  <text start="366.89" dur="5.18">a hundred and seven months the current</text>
  <text start="369.41" dur="5.79">expansion just nudged ahead of the long</text>
  <text start="372.07" dur="5.14">1960s expansion and will beat the 90s</text>
  <text start="375.2" dur="4.35">expansion for the title the longest</text>
  <text start="377.21" dur="5.88">expansion in history if it extends past</text>
  <text start="379.55" dur="5.58">July of next year now the CBO came out</text>
  <text start="383.09" dur="4.32">with their report and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="385.13" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re not expecting to have any type</text>
  <text start="387.41" dur="4.8">of recession anytime soon and I think</text>
  <text start="390.68" dur="6.84">we&amp;#39;re not going to have anything until</text>
  <text start="392.21" dur="7.74">December 31st 2028 now think about this</text>
  <text start="397.52" dur="4.89">for a second they&amp;#39;re trying to tell us</text>
  <text start="399.95" dur="3.81">that this economy is so strong that</text>
  <text start="402.41" dur="4.29">everything is so great</text>
  <text start="403.76" dur="4.83">that everyone&amp;#39;s getting jobs that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="406.7" dur="6.42">not going to have anything go wrong for</text>
  <text start="408.59" dur="8.3">another ten years I&amp;#39;m gonna tell you</text>
  <text start="413.12" dur="7.4">right now you know that they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="416.89" dur="7.42">completely wrong because as we can see</text>
  <text start="420.52" dur="8.02">the entire thing is getting ready to</text>
  <text start="424.31" dur="6.12">completely come down and the reasons we</text>
  <text start="428.54" dur="3.54">know this is because we&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="430.43" dur="3.54">at all these indicators most of them are</text>
  <text start="432.08" dur="4.68">pointing to a recession we see the yield</text>
  <text start="433.97" dur="4.05">curve we see what is happening with the</text>
  <text start="436.76" dur="3.93">housing market not just here in the</text>
  <text start="438.02" dur="6.06">United States but in Canada and out in</text>
  <text start="440.69" dur="5.49">the UK we know that Europe is a complete</text>
  <text start="444.08" dur="5.13">mess we know the banks are insolvent and</text>
  <text start="446.18" dur="6.42">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us that we</text>
  <text start="449.21" dur="5.13">have another 10 years before everything</text>
  <text start="452.6" dur="4.68">just completely falls apart</text>
  <text start="454.34" dur="6.6">whenever you ever seen a cycle go that</text>
  <text start="457.28" dur="5.7">long and to keep it going well guess</text>
  <text start="460.94" dur="4.02">what they&amp;#39;re gonna have to do other</text>
  <text start="462.98" dur="6.24">things and that&amp;#39;s going to be completely</text>
  <text start="464.96" dur="6.72">impossible because as we know Trump is</text>
  <text start="469.22" dur="3.81">trying to bring down the economy blame</text>
  <text start="471.68" dur="3.8">it on the Fed the feds trying to bring</text>
  <text start="473.03" dur="5.22">down the economy blame it on Trump and</text>
  <text start="475.48" dur="4.48">there&amp;#39;s no way that they can keep this</text>
  <text start="478.25" dur="4.68">illusion alive remember this whole thing</text>
  <text start="479.96" dur="5.04">is based on an illusion back prior to</text>
  <text start="482.93" dur="4.53">2008 before the crash happened they</text>
  <text start="485" dur="4.44">everyone believed that this would never</text>
  <text start="487.46" dur="3.87">ever end that housing prices would</text>
  <text start="489.44" dur="3.27">continually move up that we wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="491.33" dur="3.51">have a problem in the housing market</text>
  <text start="492.71" dur="4.55">that the stock market would continually</text>
  <text start="494.84" dur="5.79">move up we wouldn&amp;#39;t have a problem there</text>
  <text start="497.26" dur="5.2">corporations were fine the subprime</text>
  <text start="500.63" dur="3.09">securities they&amp;#39;re all triple-a we</text>
  <text start="502.46" dur="3.12">didn&amp;#39;t have any problems everyone</text>
  <text start="503.72" dur="3.72">thought this was going to last forever</text>
  <text start="505.58" dur="4.68">and then what happened everything</text>
  <text start="507.44" dur="4.11">completely fell apart we see inflation</text>
  <text start="510.26" dur="3.659">warning lights right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="511.55" dur="6.989">flashing as manufacturing prices soar</text>
  <text start="513.919" dur="6.571">since the most since 2011 and we can see</text>
  <text start="518.539" dur="5.611">right now that inflation has been</text>
  <text start="520.49" dur="6.29">offloaded out into the real estate</text>
  <text start="524.15" dur="5.37">market into the stock market into</text>
  <text start="526.78" dur="5.74">education I went into other countries</text>
  <text start="529.52" dur="5.34">and as we can see with the petrol you on</text>
  <text start="532.52" dur="4.76">the birth of the petrol you want well</text>
  <text start="534.86" dur="5.31">this is a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="537.28" dur="5.35">game-changer with crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="540.17" dur="4.86">coming into the fold this is a game</text>
  <text start="542.63" dur="5.22">changer all of these things are</text>
  <text start="545.03" dur="5.88">happening at once now we know that the</text>
  <text start="547.85" dur="4.62">Fed they are trying to push the economy</text>
  <text start="550.91" dur="3.57">gain the narrative and we talked about</text>
  <text start="552.47" dur="4.68">the narrative and what that means just</text>
  <text start="554.48" dur="4.17">like in the 1970s the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="557.15" dur="3.27">they had the narrative this is why</text>
  <text start="558.65" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re able to tell us the story that</text>
  <text start="560.42" dur="5.13">there were gold speculators we need to</text>
  <text start="562.46" dur="4.68">come off the gold standard we have a</text>
  <text start="565.55" dur="2.789">shortage of oil because they were moving</text>
  <text start="567.14" dur="3.53">on to the petro dollar so they had the</text>
  <text start="568.339" dur="5.521">narrative back then they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="570.67" dur="5.38">control the narrative this time we also</text>
  <text start="573.86" dur="4.44">have Trump the Patriots behind him</text>
  <text start="576.05" dur="4.38">trying to control the narrative of what</text>
  <text start="578.3" dur="4.14">the economy is doing now Trump has</text>
  <text start="580.43" dur="4.77">decided to postpone the decision about</text>
  <text start="582.44" dur="5.31">imposing steel and aluminum tariffs on</text>
  <text start="585.2" dur="6.42">the European Union and other US allies</text>
  <text start="587.75" dur="6.899">until June first and we see also that</text>
  <text start="591.62" dur="5.88">the Fed they decided not to raise</text>
  <text start="594.649" dur="4.591">interest rates right now and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="597.5" dur="7.649">saying they&amp;#39;re not going to be raising</text>
  <text start="599.24" dur="7.769">them before the mid 2018 time period now</text>
  <text start="605.149" dur="4.8">this is very interesting bus because</text>
  <text start="607.009" dur="5.64">both of them kind of halted on what they</text>
  <text start="609.949" dur="4.861">were doing and they&amp;#39;re watching each</text>
  <text start="612.649" dur="5.281">other to see who makes the next move</text>
  <text start="614.81" dur="6.509">remember this is a battle that is going</text>
  <text start="617.93" dur="6.42">on right now where each one is trying to</text>
  <text start="621.319" dur="4.651">control the narrative and while Trump is</text>
  <text start="624.35" dur="4.049">trying to bring down the economy and</text>
  <text start="625.97" dur="6.179">blame it on the Fed he&amp;#39;s also preparing</text>
  <text start="628.399" dur="5.851">the entire system for the transition</text>
  <text start="632.149" dur="5.071">because we will be transitioning away</text>
  <text start="634.25" dur="5.91">from the Federal Reserve System which is</text>
  <text start="637.22" dur="4.979">the central banking system this system</text>
  <text start="640.16" dur="5.909">that we are in right now the economic</text>
  <text start="642.199" dur="5.611">system is not a people&amp;#39;s system that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="646.069" dur="4.2">why when you pick up a dollar bill or</text>
  <text start="647.81" dur="5.129">ten dollar bill or twenty dollar bill it</text>
  <text start="650.269" dur="5.521">says Federal Reserve Note this is a</text>
  <text start="652.939" dur="4.851">central banking system they created it</text>
  <text start="655.79" dur="5.849">they designed it they control it and</text>
  <text start="657.79" dur="8.43">they keep the illusion alive today we</text>
  <text start="661.639" dur="8.31">need to continually play in their system</text>
  <text start="666.22" dur="5.289">while we work on other systems and</text>
  <text start="669.949" dur="3.06">that&amp;#39;s where the cryptocurrency market</text>
  <text start="671.509" dur="3.841">comes in because that&amp;#39;s outside of their</text>
  <text start="673.009" dur="5.101">system gold and silver is outside of</text>
  <text start="675.35" dur="5.19">their system and they hate anything that</text>
  <text start="678.11" dur="4.62">is outside of their system and this is</text>
  <text start="680.54" dur="4.56">why they are demonizing both</text>
  <text start="682.73" dur="4.26">cryptocurrency and gold silver and</text>
  <text start="685.1" dur="4.229">everything else because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
