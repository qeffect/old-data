  <text start="48.01" dur="5.61">hi and welcome you listening to the x 22</text>
  <text start="51.699" dur="6.511">report my name is dave and this is</text>
  <text start="53.62" dur="7.289">episode 1122 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="58.21" dur="4.649">november eighth 2016 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="60.909" dur="5.971">the episode is the financial nightmare</text>
  <text start="62.859" dur="8.4">begins after the election let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="66.88" dur="7.05">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="71.259" dur="4.831">today on election day we see the stock</text>
  <text start="73.93" dur="4.53">market up yesterday we saw the market</text>
  <text start="76.09" dur="4.8">was up by 300 points they wanted to get</text>
  <text start="78.46" dur="6.03">that market over 18,000 to make the</text>
  <text start="80.89" dur="7.44">economy look really great and we can see</text>
  <text start="84.49" dur="8.01">that this whole entire illusion that</text>
  <text start="88.33" dur="7.079">we&amp;#39;re in is created to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="92.5" dur="5.399">that the economy is doing well that we</text>
  <text start="95.409" dur="6.8">need to keep the establishment running</text>
  <text start="97.899" dur="6.961">the economy and there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong</text>
  <text start="102.209" dur="5.08">but we&amp;#39;ve been looking at so many</text>
  <text start="104.86" dur="4.23">different economic indicators and let me</text>
  <text start="107.289" dur="5.041">just say there are so many of them</text>
  <text start="109.09" dur="6.419">pointing to a complete recession /</text>
  <text start="112.33" dur="7.5">depression into a major collapse and</text>
  <text start="115.509" dur="8.581">there are major financial pundants there</text>
  <text start="119.83" dur="6.899">are major financial individuals who are</text>
  <text start="124.09" dur="5.49">continually saying that this system</text>
  <text start="126.729" dur="5.781">right now it is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="129.58" dur="5.64">and at everything that we looked at and</text>
  <text start="132.51" dur="4.66">everything that we dive into and we rip</text>
  <text start="135.22" dur="6.78">apart what the government is telling us</text>
  <text start="137.17" dur="7.56">we see that the entire system is ready</text>
  <text start="142" dur="5.06">to implode and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="144.73" dur="6.509">the labor market is ready to roll over</text>
  <text start="147.06" dur="6.16">hiring is below 2014 levels and there</text>
  <text start="151.239" dur="4.441">are more and more job openings out there</text>
  <text start="153.22" dur="5.879">and I explained what these job openings</text>
  <text start="155.68" dur="6.57">are where a lot of companies what they</text>
  <text start="159.099" dur="4.651">do is they keep the jobs open they make</text>
  <text start="162.25" dur="4.31">it seem like they&amp;#39;re going to be hiring</text>
  <text start="163.75" dur="8.04">and then they put all these requirements</text>
  <text start="166.56" dur="7.149">into what the job is and most most of</text>
  <text start="171.79" dur="4.64">the people can&amp;#39;t even fit into these</text>
  <text start="173.709" dur="6.791">jobs because it&amp;#39;s completely impossible</text>
  <text start="176.43" dur="8.789">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="180.5" dur="6.879">the entire labor market where all the</text>
  <text start="185.219" dur="3.72">people that have fallen off where we</text>
  <text start="187.379" dur="4.621">have all the manipulated unemployment</text>
  <text start="188.939" dur="6.53">numbers well it is completely rolling</text>
  <text start="192" dur="6.329">over and this is despite near record</text>
  <text start="195.469" dur="7.151">number of job openings the pace of</text>
  <text start="198.329" dur="7.321">hiring has failed to keep up with the</text>
  <text start="202.62" dur="7.489">number of job openings that we are</text>
  <text start="205.65" dur="8.789">seeing today and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="210.109" dur="7.66">that this is done on purpose this is</text>
  <text start="214.439" dur="6.151">part of the illusion that the economy is</text>
  <text start="217.769" dur="6.45">doing fine because what the government</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="8.28">central bankers do they instruct the</text>
  <text start="224.219" dur="7.83">corporation&amp;#39;s to continually put out job</text>
  <text start="228.87" dur="6.119">openings make the requirements very very</text>
  <text start="232.049" dur="6.151">difficult and never fill the jobs this</text>
  <text start="234.989" dur="6.571">is what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing and actually</text>
  <text start="238.2" dur="4.679">right after 2008 2009 2010 we saw the</text>
  <text start="241.56" dur="5.489">same thing there were a lot of job</text>
  <text start="242.879" dur="7.051">openings but nobody was hiring going</text>
  <text start="247.049" dur="4.53">throughout this entire recovery as the</text>
  <text start="249.93" dur="5.1">government calls it we&amp;#39;ve seen the same</text>
  <text start="251.579" dur="6.63">thing a lot of job openings but not a</text>
  <text start="255.03" dur="6.389">lot of companies hiring and if we look</text>
  <text start="258.209" dur="6.24">back to a year ago we can see hirings</text>
  <text start="261.419" dur="5.401">right now are down by one percent and</text>
  <text start="264.449" dur="6.84">what&amp;#39;s more interesting than that is</text>
  <text start="266.82" dur="8.219">that if we look at payrolls and we look</text>
  <text start="271.289" dur="5.94">at job hires well guess what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="275.039" dur="6.181">both declining when did we see this once</text>
  <text start="277.229" dur="7.651">before well we saw this back in two</text>
  <text start="281.22" dur="7.34">thousand eight where all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="284.88" dur="7.95">payrolls started to decline job hiring</text>
  <text start="288.56" dur="6.82">starting to decline and we went into</text>
  <text start="292.83" dur="5.16">freefall and the whole thing just kept</text>
  <text start="295.38" dur="6.09">on tumbling and tumbling down non-stop</text>
  <text start="297.99" dur="6.479">and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing once again</text>
  <text start="301.47" dur="6.9">we&amp;#39;re actually following the same exact</text>
  <text start="304.469" dur="5.151">pattern we see right now that student</text>
  <text start="308.37" dur="4.88">loans</text>
  <text start="309.62" dur="7.74">auto loans they have hit an all-time new</text>
  <text start="313.25" dur="6.27">high of 2.5 trillion dollars we see</text>
  <text start="317.36" dur="5.85">consumer credit has jumped by 19 billion</text>
  <text start="319.52" dur="6.72">and of course we expect this to happen</text>
  <text start="323.21" dur="5.929">because the central bankers their job is</text>
  <text start="326.24" dur="6.81">to blow up bubbles their job is to</text>
  <text start="329.139" dur="6.31">create more debt and this is what</text>
  <text start="333.05" dur="7.55">they&amp;#39;ve been doing and we can see right</text>
  <text start="335.449" dur="7.621">now that revolving debt is increasing</text>
  <text start="340.6" dur="5.71">but when we look at this very closely</text>
  <text start="343.07" dur="6.09">and we look at consumer debt we see that</text>
  <text start="346.31" dur="6.72">the government is responsible for most</text>
  <text start="349.16" dur="6.78">of it that&amp;#39;s the primary source of this</text>
  <text start="353.03" dur="6.24">debt when we look at student loans and</text>
  <text start="355.94" dur="6.15">auto loans well they just continually</text>
  <text start="359.27" dur="4.8">move up and up and up and this is</text>
  <text start="362.09" dur="6.21">exactly what the central bankers want</text>
  <text start="364.07" dur="5.61">because they deal in debt and we can see</text>
  <text start="368.3" dur="4.2">from everything that we&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="369.68" dur="3.959">at when we look at all these economic</text>
  <text start="372.5" dur="3.24">indicators and we put them all together</text>
  <text start="373.639" dur="4.921">and we create this picture we can see</text>
  <text start="375.74" dur="5.16">that we are doing the same thing that</text>
  <text start="378.56" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;ve done back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="380.9" dur="4.199">but this time the indicators are the</text>
  <text start="383.81" dur="5.579">same as two thousand eight or much worse</text>
  <text start="385.099" dur="6.301">and in many cases they are so bad that</text>
  <text start="389.389" dur="4.441">we are not in a recession we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="391.4" dur="4.98">teetering on a complete depression</text>
  <text start="393.83" dur="7.74">collapse scenario and we can see that</text>
  <text start="396.38" dur="7.319">the entire economy was held together to</text>
  <text start="401.57" dur="5.79">create this illusion for the elections</text>
  <text start="403.699" dur="6.421">to create the illusion that everything</text>
  <text start="407.36" dur="4.86">is fine because we know what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="410.12" dur="3.87">going to plan out here we know that</text>
  <text start="412.22" dur="5.009">after the elections when everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="413.99" dur="4.56">all said and done this economy&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="417.229" dur="3.06">to come tumbling down now is going to be</text>
  <text start="418.55" dur="3.869">the next day or the day after that no</text>
  <text start="420.289" dur="4.201">most likely not I think what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="422.419" dur="5.161">going to do once they have their</text>
  <text start="424.49" dur="5.28">candidate depending on who it is if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="427.58" dur="6.54">Trump I believe they&amp;#39;re going to bring</text>
  <text start="429.77" dur="6.84">it down quickly to say this is the</text>
  <text start="434.12" dur="5.609">reason why it&amp;#39;s happening because he is</text>
  <text start="436.61" dur="5.25">going to become president and all of a</text>
  <text start="439.729" dur="3.271">sudden the economy just drops down we</text>
  <text start="441.86" dur="3.39">enter war he</text>
  <text start="443" dur="4.68">has to deal with all this if he makes it</text>
  <text start="445.25" dur="4.14">through all of this if it&amp;#39;s Hillary</text>
  <text start="447.68" dur="3.66">Clinton I think they&amp;#39;re going to wait</text>
  <text start="449.39" dur="5.13">until after January most likely in the</text>
  <text start="451.34" dur="4.98">spring where they&amp;#39;ll probably start to</text>
  <text start="454.52" dur="3.57">bring everything down everything to</text>
  <text start="456.32" dur="4.44">start to crash because they will not be</text>
  <text start="458.09" dur="5.46">able to hold this together and we can</text>
  <text start="460.76" dur="4.8">see right now that this will all be</text>
  <text start="463.55" dur="3.15">blamed most likely on Russia because we</text>
  <text start="465.56" dur="4.83">see they&amp;#39;re pointing their fingers at</text>
  <text start="466.7" dur="5.43">Russia at this point for cyber attacking</text>
  <text start="470.39" dur="3.96">which they have no proof this is all</text>
  <text start="472.13" dur="7.2">complete propaganda this is fitting into</text>
  <text start="474.35" dur="6.96">their entire false flag narrative but we</text>
  <text start="479.33" dur="5.19">can see right now that once these</text>
  <text start="481.31" dur="5.52">elections are over and there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="484.52" dur="7.2">change of the guard depending on who it</text>
  <text start="486.83" dur="7.86">is it&amp;#39;s go time they are ready to bring</text>
  <text start="491.72" dur="5.84">the economy down there ready to blame</text>
  <text start="494.69" dur="5.4">another party for what has happened and</text>
  <text start="497.56" dur="4.39">we can see it&amp;#39;s very easy for them to</text>
  <text start="500.09" dur="3.84">say listen we&amp;#39;re bringing in a new</text>
  <text start="501.95" dur="4.59">president look what happened you know</text>
  <text start="503.93" dur="5.94">Russia North Korea China whatever they</text>
  <text start="506.54" dur="5.85">hit the United States with some type of</text>
  <text start="509.87" dur="4.77">cyber attack and they hit the financial</text>
  <text start="512.39" dur="5.67">institutions they brought the economy</text>
  <text start="514.64" dur="5.459">down the economy was doing fine and they</text>
  <text start="518.06" dur="4.38">did this at a point where there was a</text>
  <text start="520.099" dur="5.731">changing of the guards and we can see</text>
  <text start="522.44" dur="6.87">right now they will eventually do this</text>
  <text start="525.83" dur="8.37">because there is no way out of this the</text>
  <text start="529.31" dur="7.35">economy is imploding on itself and its</text>
  <text start="534.2" dur="6.18">deteriorating very very quickly where</text>
  <text start="536.66" dur="6.75">they all have no choice but to bring it</text>
  <text start="540.38" dur="6.09">down and they&amp;#39;re just waiting for right</text>
  <text start="543.41" dur="5.04">after the elections listen everyone</text>
  <text start="546.47" dur="4.41">thanks a lot for listening be well be</text>
  <text start="548.45" dur="4.58">safe and especially be prepared thanks a</text>
