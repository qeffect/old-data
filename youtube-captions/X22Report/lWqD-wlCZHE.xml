  <text start="29.369" dur="6.241">dave and this is episode 253 and today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="32.4" dur="5.16">date is january second 2014 and the</text>
  <text start="35.61" dur="4.74">title of this episode is that government</text>
  <text start="37.56" dur="4.769">is coming for your guns taxes and your</text>
  <text start="40.35" dur="3.81">rights and i just want to welcome</text>
  <text start="42.329" dur="4.561">everyone back i hope everyone had a</text>
  <text start="44.16" dur="5.34">happy new year let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="46.89" dur="5.34">economic collapse news now previously i</text>
  <text start="49.5" dur="5.07">talked about how the government and this</text>
  <text start="52.23" dur="5.16">was in past reports how the government</text>
  <text start="54.57" dur="5.039">was modifying student loans for college</text>
  <text start="57.39" dur="3.66">graduates and the reason why they have</text>
  <text start="59.609" dur="3.031">to do this is because most of the</text>
  <text start="61.05" dur="5.07">college graduates can&amp;#39;t find jobs today</text>
  <text start="62.64" dur="5.7">and the rate is anywhere between twenty</text>
  <text start="66.12" dur="4.53">and thirty five percent most of the</text>
  <text start="68.34" dur="3.72">college graduates are finding part-time</text>
  <text start="70.65" dur="3.48">work they&amp;#39;re living with their parents</text>
  <text start="72.06" dur="4.62">where they can&amp;#39;t find work at all so</text>
  <text start="74.13" dur="5.16">they can&amp;#39;t pay off this heavy debt load</text>
  <text start="76.68" dur="5.1">so they&amp;#39;re modifying and allowing these</text>
  <text start="79.29" dur="6.99">students to you know go longer before</text>
  <text start="81.78" dur="8.76">they make payments so right now there is</text>
  <text start="86.28" dur="8.79">a bill being introduced by Elizabeth</text>
  <text start="90.54" dur="7.829">Warren Jack Reed Dickerman and what</text>
  <text start="95.07" dur="6.24">they&amp;#39;re trying to do is have colleges</text>
  <text start="98.369" dur="4.89">pay for those students who are</text>
  <text start="101.31" dur="3.599">defaulting on their student loans</text>
  <text start="103.259" dur="4.621">because what the government is realizing</text>
  <text start="104.909" dur="6.181">is that since these youths coming out of</text>
  <text start="107.88" dur="5.82">college they can&amp;#39;t find work and they</text>
  <text start="111.09" dur="5.16">have no money coming in so a lot of them</text>
  <text start="113.7" dur="4.559">are defaulting on their student loans</text>
  <text start="116.25" dur="4.5">and that means they&amp;#39;re not getting the</text>
  <text start="118.259" dur="5.191">interest on the loans and they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="120.75" dur="4.95">money so now they want colleges to say</text>
  <text start="123.45" dur="3.779">hey you know you educated these people</text>
  <text start="125.7" dur="4.05">now they can&amp;#39;t find jobs so you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="127.229" dur="5.431">to have to take the blame for this and</text>
  <text start="129.75" dur="6.78">we&amp;#39;re going to have to have you pay for</text>
  <text start="132.66" dur="6.359">the defaulting student and this goes on</text>
  <text start="136.53" dur="3.71">to say that the student borrowers Bill</text>
  <text start="139.019" dur="2.691">of Rights that</text>
  <text start="140.24" dur="3.51">would put more emphasis on getting</text>
  <text start="141.71" dur="4.17">services to offer students affordable</text>
  <text start="143.75" dur="4.62">repayment plans the Senators want</text>
  <text start="145.88" dur="4.5">schools with lots of struggling bars to</text>
  <text start="148.37" dur="5.07">compensate the government for loan</text>
  <text start="150.38" dur="6.15">repayment losses the proposal would for</text>
  <text start="153.44" dur="6.03">schools to pay a penalty along a sliding</text>
  <text start="156.53" dur="5.34">scale based on how frequently students</text>
  <text start="159.47" dur="5.01">default on their loans and you know</text>
  <text start="161.87" dur="4.8">what&amp;#39;s going to happen here if this</text>
  <text start="164.48" dur="4.74">actually goes through colleges are going</text>
  <text start="166.67" dur="5.52">to raise prices students are going to be</text>
  <text start="169.22" dur="6.75">put into more debt and this will never</text>
  <text start="172.19" dur="6.84">end because again when a government has</text>
  <text start="175.97" dur="5.13">massive amount of debt they can&amp;#39;t bring</text>
  <text start="179.03" dur="3.75">in the revenue to cover the interest on</text>
  <text start="181.1" dur="5.64">this that even if the interest rates are</text>
  <text start="182.78" dur="6.81">at record time lows they still can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="186.74" dur="6.6">meet the revenue that they need so they</text>
  <text start="189.59" dur="6.39">start to look for money anywhere they</text>
  <text start="193.34" dur="5.88">can they impose more laws they try to</text>
  <text start="195.98" dur="7.2">get more taxes and they look all around</text>
  <text start="199.22" dur="6.6">the world to find this hidden money and</text>
  <text start="203.18" dur="6.98">this is the end game and this is what</text>
  <text start="205.82" dur="8.64">they end up doing every single time now</text>
  <text start="210.16" dur="8.11">the end of 2013 Congress is going to</text>
  <text start="214.46" dur="6.57">allow 55 tax breaks to expire why</text>
  <text start="218.27" dur="4.47">because it will bring in more revenue so</text>
  <text start="221.03" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re getting rid of the tax breaks</text>
  <text start="222.74" dur="3.96">and they want more revenue and they want</text>
  <text start="225.2" dur="3.39">to charge you more taxes and this is an</text>
  <text start="226.7" dur="3.48">easy way of doing it because they said</text>
  <text start="228.59" dur="3.57">you know what we didn&amp;#39;t implement new</text>
  <text start="230.18" dur="4.71">laws we just let them expire and we</text>
  <text start="232.16" dur="4.68">really didn&amp;#39;t do anything and they need</text>
  <text start="234.89" dur="4.38">to do this just like in France they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="236.84" dur="3.9">imposing the 75 percent tax on the</text>
  <text start="239.27" dur="2.94">millionaires but you know that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="240.74" dur="3.75">to trickle down and pretty soon they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="242.21" dur="3.81">say oh that wasn&amp;#39;t enough money because</text>
  <text start="244.49" dur="3.39">now we just took on more debt so now you</text>
  <text start="246.02" dur="4.47">have to do 75 percent on those who are</text>
  <text start="247.88" dur="5.01">making 500,000 75 for seventy-five</text>
  <text start="250.49" dur="3.63">percent making 203,000 and this is how</text>
  <text start="252.89" dur="3.51">it works and they&amp;#39;re doing the same</text>
  <text start="254.12" dur="5.88">thing here in the US they are looking</text>
  <text start="256.4" dur="7.31">everywhere for money and they need the</text>
  <text start="260" dur="6.33">money in order to keep everything</text>
  <text start="263.71" dur="4.42">operating and this is why factor is</text>
  <text start="266.33" dur="4.89">going into effect where they can go</text>
  <text start="268.13" dur="5.38">across into other countries and find the</text>
  <text start="271.22" dur="4.27">money they can go into Switzerland</text>
  <text start="273.51" dur="4.29">and they want those banks to report</text>
  <text start="275.49" dur="4.5">those people who have money in those</text>
  <text start="277.8" dur="4.95">banks so they can charge them and get</text>
  <text start="279.99" dur="5.73">taxes for it factor for those people who</text>
  <text start="282.75" dur="5.16">have a u.s. passport but work outside of</text>
  <text start="285.72" dur="5.13">the US they are going to be taxed there</text>
  <text start="287.91" dur="5.19">is a bill right now floating around the</text>
  <text start="290.85" dur="7.2">US Congress where if you decide to turn</text>
  <text start="293.1" dur="6.51">in your passport and you want to leave</text>
  <text start="298.05" dur="4.86">the country they&amp;#39;re going to take thirty</text>
  <text start="299.61" dur="6.84">percent of your wealth this is all being</text>
  <text start="302.91" dur="6.69">done to capture and to collect as much</text>
  <text start="306.45" dur="5.88">money as they possibly can before</text>
  <text start="309.6" dur="4.62">everything completely collapses because</text>
  <text start="312.33" dur="3.6">they believe if they continually do this</text>
  <text start="314.22" dur="4.23">they will be able to keep the system</text>
  <text start="315.93" dur="5.16">going but you know this from a if you</text>
  <text start="318.45" dur="4.86">just look at a at your household if you</text>
  <text start="321.09" dur="4.98">have a certain amount of money coming in</text>
  <text start="323.31" dur="4.98">and you have huge amounts of debt yes</text>
  <text start="326.07" dur="4.44">you can sell off your TV you can sell</text>
  <text start="328.29" dur="5.91">off your car you can sell off everything</text>
  <text start="330.51" dur="5.91">but as you continually pile up debt you</text>
  <text start="334.2" dur="5.28">run out of things to sell you run out of</text>
  <text start="336.42" dur="5.85">things to bring in money and eventually</text>
  <text start="339.48" dur="5.46">what happens you declare bankruptcy and</text>
  <text start="342.27" dur="4.89">this is what&amp;#39;s going to happen to the US</text>
  <text start="344.94" dur="4.08">government there is no way out of this</text>
  <text start="347.16" dur="4.11">and people say well they can print money</text>
  <text start="349.02" dur="4.11">they can keep printing yeah as they keep</text>
  <text start="351.27" dur="3.57">printing guess what they keep adding to</text>
  <text start="353.13" dur="4.38">the debt that means more interest</text>
  <text start="354.84" dur="5.61">payments and as less revenue comes in</text>
  <text start="357.51" dur="4.59">they have to increase the amount that</text>
  <text start="360.45" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re borrowing and as they increase</text>
  <text start="362.1" dur="4.23">the amount they are boring the interest</text>
  <text start="364.2" dur="5.1">payments get larger and larger and</text>
  <text start="366.33" dur="5.7">larger and the debt continually Rises at</text>
  <text start="369.3" dur="5.46">a faster and faster pace and we have all</text>
  <text start="372.03" dur="6.15">seen the graphs that the debt has</text>
  <text start="374.76" dur="6.54">increased in the last since 2008 in</text>
  <text start="378.18" dur="5.82">incredibly a huge amount compared to</text>
  <text start="381.3" dur="5.01">everything before 2008 going all the way</text>
  <text start="384" dur="4.77">back to nineteen thirteen so we can see</text>
  <text start="386.31" dur="4.89">what is happening and going forward the</text>
  <text start="388.77" dur="5.28">debts going to even its it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="391.2" dur="4.95">multiply as time goes on and before you</text>
  <text start="394.05" dur="4.65">know it they&amp;#39;ll be printing so much and</text>
  <text start="396.15" dur="5.1">so fast that people it will be just like</text>
  <text start="398.7" dur="5.01">the weimer Republic where things just</text>
  <text start="401.25" dur="5.389">get completely out of hand and they</text>
  <text start="403.71" dur="5.959">cannot stop it</text>
  <text start="406.639" dur="5.791">okay now we understand that Obamacare is</text>
  <text start="409.669" dur="6.15">a cash grab they have taxes within</text>
  <text start="412.43" dur="5.25">Obamacare their penalties and there is</text>
  <text start="415.819" dur="3.241">one doctor and you might have seen the</text>
  <text start="417.68" dur="5.459">video already but I just want to read</text>
  <text start="419.06" dur="6.569">what she said this is dr. Bell ours she</text>
  <text start="423.139" dur="6.33">wrote a one sentence of what Obamacare</text>
  <text start="425.629" dur="6.51">is and this is what she said we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="429.469" dur="5.73">to be gifted with a health care plan we</text>
  <text start="432.139" dur="5.52">are forced to purchase and find if we</text>
  <text start="435.199" dur="5.041">don&amp;#39;t which purportedly covers at least</text>
  <text start="437.659" dur="6.051">10 million more people without adding a</text>
  <text start="440.24" dur="7.47">single new doctor but provides for</text>
  <text start="443.71" dur="6.489">60,000 new IRS agents written by a</text>
  <text start="447.71" dur="5.069">committee whose chairman says he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="450.199" dur="5.611">understand it passed by a Congress that</text>
  <text start="452.779" dur="6.301">didn&amp;#39;t read it but exempt him themselves</text>
  <text start="455.81" dur="6.329">from it and signed by a president who</text>
  <text start="459.08" dur="6.119">smokes with a funding administered by a</text>
  <text start="462.139" dur="6.18">Treasury treif who didn&amp;#39;t pay his taxes</text>
  <text start="465.199" dur="6.15">for which we will be taxed for four</text>
  <text start="468.319" dur="4.71">years before any benefits take effect by</text>
  <text start="471.349" dur="4.5">the government which has already</text>
  <text start="473.029" dur="5.85">bankrupted Social Security and Medicare</text>
  <text start="475.849" dur="6.54">all to be overseen by a surgeon general</text>
  <text start="478.879" dur="7.71">who is obese and financed by a country</text>
  <text start="482.389" dur="9.06">that is broke and she pretty much summed</text>
  <text start="486.589" dur="7.32">up exactly what Obamacare is this law</text>
  <text start="491.449" dur="5.37">that they put into place of course they</text>
  <text start="493.909" dur="7.581">use the NSA spying and blackmailed some</text>
  <text start="496.819" dur="10.32">judges and they put it in place to</text>
  <text start="501.49" dur="9.549">collect taxes from the people to give</text>
  <text start="507.139" dur="7.44">money to the insurance companies this is</text>
  <text start="511.039" dur="7.74">all this is this is not to help the</text>
  <text start="514.579" dur="7.95">everyday American person this is to take</text>
  <text start="518.779" dur="5.941">from them more money and they need to do</text>
  <text start="522.529" dur="4.771">this and this is why this was pushed</text>
  <text start="524.72" dur="4.799">through this is why you weren&amp;#39;t Congress</text>
  <text start="527.3" dur="5.43">was not allowed to read it and this is</text>
  <text start="529.519" dur="5.491">why they were forced to pass it and this</text>
  <text start="532.73" dur="5.25">is why when they went and they looked at</text>
  <text start="535.01" dur="5.46">it they exempted everybody and Obama</text>
  <text start="537.98" dur="5.16">Obama had to bail out</text>
  <text start="540.47" dur="4.62">staffers who said hey we can&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="543.14" dur="3.84">this this is too expensive we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="545.09" dur="3.75">money for this so Obama said oh don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="546.98" dur="3.57">worry about that what will pay for it</text>
  <text start="548.84" dur="4.32">for you but who&amp;#39;s going to pay for all</text>
  <text start="550.55" dur="4.83">the Americans who say listen I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="553.16" dur="4.11">afford this and my deductibles are way</text>
  <text start="555.38" dur="5.37">too high and if I don&amp;#39;t take it I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="557.27" dur="5.4">taxed so you know you look at this and</text>
  <text start="560.75" dur="5.79">you know it is not for the people and</text>
  <text start="562.67" dur="7.62">right now Obamacare results there are</text>
  <text start="566.54" dur="4.98">more canceled plans that outnumber the</text>
  <text start="570.29" dur="3.69">amount of people that are enrolling in</text>
  <text start="571.52" dur="4.44">Obamacare more Americans have lost their</text>
  <text start="573.98" dur="3.51">coverage than those who enrolled in</text>
  <text start="575.96" dur="3.75">Obamacare at least four point seven</text>
  <text start="577.49" dur="4.5">million people have lost their insurance</text>
  <text start="579.71" dur="5.1">coverage to date as of yesterday only</text>
  <text start="581.99" dur="5.43">two million customers signed up for</text>
  <text start="584.81" dur="5.58">obamacare and what they&amp;#39;re going to find</text>
  <text start="587.42" dur="5.82">out is that this health insurance that</text>
  <text start="590.39" dur="5.7">they signed up for doesn&amp;#39;t do a thing</text>
  <text start="593.24" dur="5.37">for them because the deductibles are so</text>
  <text start="596.09" dur="5.25">high you need to meet the deductibles</text>
  <text start="598.61" dur="5.28">first before the insurance actually</text>
  <text start="601.34" dur="4.47">kicks in but you still have to pay the</text>
  <text start="603.89" dur="4.41">monthly premium so you&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="605.81" dur="4.35">see any benefit from the insurance why</text>
  <text start="608.3" dur="3.66">do you think Congress completely</text>
  <text start="610.16" dur="4.32">exempted themselves why do you think</text>
  <text start="611.96" dur="5.25">Obama didn&amp;#39;t drop his governmental</text>
  <text start="614.48" dur="7.62">insurance because this insurance sucks</text>
  <text start="617.21" dur="7.38">that&amp;#39;s why and they know it now the</text>
  <text start="622.1" dur="6.51">government right now and especially in</text>
  <text start="624.59" dur="7.2">the very populated areas where they are</text>

  <text start="631.79" dur="5.04">is going to happen in these cities and</text>

  <text start="1243.89" dur="5.82">land they will be at sea and they will</text>
  <text start="1246.26" dur="5.88">be in the skies and of course one of the</text>
