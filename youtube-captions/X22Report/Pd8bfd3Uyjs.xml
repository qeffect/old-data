  <text start="31.47" dur="6">move on the economic collapse and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="35.76" dur="6.15">going to go through the car news today</text>
  <text start="37.47" dur="7.56">and i&amp;#39;m just going to discuss what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="41.91" dur="6.87">next and what they&amp;#39;re planning to do in</text>
  <text start="45.03" dur="7.23">regards of robbing us of our money i was</text>
  <text start="48.78" dur="5.459">just thinking of a scenario from</text>
  <text start="52.26" dur="5.07">everything that i&amp;#39;ve been reading and i</text>
  <text start="54.239" dur="5.401">just wanted to go and and discuss this</text>
  <text start="57.33" dur="5.039">and maybe get feedback from you from</text>
  <text start="59.64" dur="5.4">comments and things like that but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="62.369" dur="4.68">look at that let&amp;#39;s look at the the</text>
  <text start="65.04" dur="5.81">economic collapse news right now and see</text>
  <text start="67.049" dur="5.82">what&amp;#39;s going on so south carolina is</text>
  <text start="70.85" dur="4.42">creating a bill that would make it a</text>
  <text start="72.869" dur="4.051">crime to implement Obamacare they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="75.27" dur="5.01">saying that obamacare is completely</text>
  <text start="76.92" dur="5.91">unconstitutional and that would be null</text>
  <text start="80.28" dur="4.44">and void in south carolina personally i</text>
  <text start="82.83" dur="4.8">think every single state should do this</text>
  <text start="84.72" dur="8.28">because it&amp;#39;s ridiculous they&amp;#39;re forcing</text>
  <text start="87.63" dur="8.19">you to purchase health insurance or get</text>
  <text start="93" dur="6.45">taxed and i hear some of the people</text>
  <text start="95.82" dur="5.549">saying well it&amp;#39;ll be cheaper if I just</text>
  <text start="99.45" dur="4.97">got taxed than if i purchased a health</text>
  <text start="101.369" dur="8">insurance so how is this giving everyone</text>
  <text start="104.42" dur="4.949">health insurance and the other thing is</text>
  <text start="109.85" dur="6.189">companies are going to reduce hours so</text>
  <text start="114.179" dur="5.43">they don&amp;#39;t have to give health insurance</text>
  <text start="116.039" dur="9.301">so the whole thing is a ridiculous scam</text>
  <text start="119.609" dur="8.4">and a ridiculous unconstitutional law</text>
  <text start="125.34" dur="5.37">that he came out with that nobody read</text>
  <text start="128.009" dur="5.251">and you know it&amp;#39;s bad because Congress</text>
  <text start="130.71" dur="5.97">is even asking to be exempt from this it</text>
  <text start="133.26" dur="5.37">is so bad that no one even read it and</text>
  <text start="136.68" dur="4.35">when someone ever tells you to oh no</text>
  <text start="138.63" dur="5.579">after you approve of this then you can</text>
  <text start="141.03" dur="4.98">read it you know it&amp;#39;s really bad i mean</text>
  <text start="144.209" dur="4.231">think about it if you&amp;#39;re going to buy a</text>
  <text start="146.01" dur="5.24">car or house and you and they tell you</text>
  <text start="148.44" dur="6.66">listen you can read these thousand pages</text>
  <text start="151.25" dur="4.69">after you buy that house you can read</text>
  <text start="155.1" dur="4.83">the cell</text>
  <text start="155.94" dur="5.85">pages after you buy this car no you read</text>
  <text start="159.93" dur="4.41">it beforehand I don&amp;#39;t understand our</text>
  <text start="161.79" dur="7.76">leaders today they&amp;#39;re just signing off</text>
  <text start="164.34" dur="9.15">on things they don&amp;#39;t read I mean really</text>
  <text start="169.55" dur="5.95">so moving on the arizona governor vetoes</text>
  <text start="173.49" dur="6.42">bill making gold and silver leaguer</text>
  <text start="175.5" dur="7.46">legal tender so I mean she&amp;#39;s stating</text>
  <text start="179.91" dur="6">that you know it would be a loss of</text>
  <text start="182.96" dur="4.87">revenue to the state while giving</text>
  <text start="185.91" dur="3.84">businesses that buy and sell collectible</text>
  <text start="187.83" dur="4.26">coins or currency originally authorized</text>
  <text start="189.75" dur="6.33">by kamar Congress in unfair tax</text>
  <text start="192.09" dur="9.84">advantage so is she looking as this as</text>
  <text start="196.08" dur="8.99">really as for her career and for</text>
  <text start="201.93" dur="6.06">political reasons or is she vetoing this</text>
  <text start="205.07" dur="5.29">for the people it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="207.99" dur="5.7">for the for the people and maintaining</text>
  <text start="210.36" dur="6.66">the state she&amp;#39;s in the mindset of</text>
  <text start="213.69" dur="7.29">collecting taxes and revenue and keeping</text>
  <text start="217.02" dur="6.12">the government employed and and but</text>
  <text start="220.98" dur="8.46">she&amp;#39;s not looking at the whole entire</text>
  <text start="223.14" dur="8.22">endgame I mean she she goes on to say</text>
  <text start="229.44" dur="5">you know while I believe the concern</text>
  <text start="231.36" dur="4.98">over devalue dollar as a result of an</text>
  <text start="234.44" dur="4.54">unsustainable federal deficit is</text>
  <text start="236.34" dur="6.59">justified I am unable to support the</text>
  <text start="238.98" dur="5.82">legislation so she knows what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="242.93" dur="3.4">she just doesn&amp;#39;t want to do anything</text>
  <text start="244.8" dur="3.87">about it because it might hurt her</text>
  <text start="246.33" dur="5.55">career might hurt the tax revenue it</text>
  <text start="248.67" dur="5.28">might hurt her voting it might hurt you</text>
  <text start="251.88" dur="5.91">know and she&amp;#39;s not looking at the big</text>
  <text start="253.95" dur="6.659">picture right here and the payroll</text>
  <text start="257.79" dur="4.5">numbers just came out today and you know</text>
  <text start="260.609" dur="3.81">and everyone&amp;#39;s you know cheering and</text>
  <text start="262.29" dur="8.97">clapping unemployment went down and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="264.419" dur="11.971">from 7.6 to 7.5 and you know 165,000 you</text>
  <text start="271.26" dur="7.68">know people they expected 140 and you</text>
  <text start="276.39" dur="5.37">know looking at this and just looking at</text>
  <text start="278.94" dur="5.52">headlines it looks fantastic but we have</text>
  <text start="281.76" dur="6.22">to remember they changed the</text>
  <text start="284.46" dur="7.06">unemployment calculation</text>
  <text start="287.98" dur="5.58">and you know as they keep changing the</text>
  <text start="291.52" dur="7.17">calculations and massaging the data</text>
  <text start="293.56" dur="8.58">making it look better it&amp;#39;s showing a</text>
  <text start="298.69" dur="9.18">false picture in so many ways so I went</text>
  <text start="302.14" dur="7.74">to shadow stats calm and he uses the</text>
  <text start="307.87" dur="5.79">same unemployment calculation that was</text>
  <text start="309.88" dur="8.25">used back like in the 70s and he has on</text>
  <text start="313.66" dur="5.67">his page on shadow set calm you know the</text>
  <text start="318.13" dur="2.55">official you three which of the</text>
  <text start="319.33" dur="3.78">government and they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s down</text>
  <text start="320.68" dur="4.32">to 7.5 and you&amp;#39;re looking at the graph</text>
  <text start="323.11" dur="4.95">line and you seeing that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325" dur="5.9">decreasing and you look at the broadest</text>
  <text start="328.06" dur="5.73">they use six and we&amp;#39;re up around</text>
  <text start="330.9" dur="4.57">fourteen percent and it looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="333.79" dur="3.93">coming down but then you look at the</text>
  <text start="335.47" dur="5.87">shadows that&amp;#39;s where he&amp;#39;s using me the</text>
  <text start="337.72" dur="7.38">original calculation for unemployment</text>
  <text start="341.34" dur="5.23">where you&amp;#39;re not excluding those people</text>
  <text start="345.1" dur="3.51">that aren&amp;#39;t looking anymore because</text>
  <text start="346.57" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s no hope of finding a job or</text>
  <text start="348.61" dur="5.4">those people who are underemployed or</text>
  <text start="350.95" dur="5.88">maybe have that used to have one job now</text>
  <text start="354.01" dur="6.63">they have two jobs just to try to break</text>
  <text start="356.83" dur="6.75">even in what they were making before his</text>
  <text start="360.64" dur="5.85">graph line is going up and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.58" dur="5.64">approaching twenty four percent so this</text>
  <text start="366.49" dur="7.44">is a very big difference in the</text>
  <text start="369.22" dur="9.21">calculation and there are other things</text>
  <text start="373.93" dur="8.28">that that are going on here with the job</text>
  <text start="378.43" dur="6.72">numbers now karl denninger came out and</text>
  <text start="382.21" dur="6.15">he was discussing the unemployment</text>
  <text start="385.15" dur="6.9">numbers and he realized that the amount</text>
  <text start="388.36" dur="6.96">of hours that people are working has</text>
  <text start="392.05" dur="7.62">gone down and it&amp;#39;s down to thirty four</text>
  <text start="395.32" dur="9.38">point four hours and he&amp;#39;s saying as we</text>
  <text start="399.67" dur="5.03">keep reducing the hours it&amp;#39;s like losing</text>
  <text start="406.29" dur="4.45">700,000 people because if you take it</text>
  <text start="408.61" dur="4.83">across the country and you reduce</text>
  <text start="410.74" dur="6.06">everyone&amp;#39;s hours and i believe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="413.44" dur="6.36">decreased by point one hour you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="416.8" dur="4.47">you&amp;#39;re really saying that there&amp;#39;s less</text>
  <text start="419.8" dur="5.1">people were</text>
  <text start="421.27" dur="7.26">working right now and he goes on to say</text>
  <text start="424.9" dur="6.81">that it&amp;#39;s not going to stop there when</text>
  <text start="428.53" dur="6.03">Obamacare hits people are going to</text>
  <text start="431.71" dur="4.95">reduce everyone&amp;#39;s hours so they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="434.56" dur="4.68">have to supply them with health</text>
  <text start="436.66" dur="6.66">insurance so if you were working 40</text>
  <text start="439.24" dur="6.21">hours or 35 hours or 37 hours whatever</text>
  <text start="443.32" dur="5.82">you&amp;#39;re working and the magic number is</text>
  <text start="445.45" dur="7.74">you know 26 hours those are a lot of</text>
  <text start="449.14" dur="7.17">hours lost people making less money so</text>
  <text start="453.19" dur="5.34">employers do not have to give health</text>
  <text start="456.31" dur="6.27">insurance to these people so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.53" dur="7.37">going to be less of a tax revenue less</text>
  <text start="462.58" dur="6.87">people going out spending on retail and</text>
  <text start="465.9" dur="5.98">this is going to cause a major major</text>
  <text start="469.45" dur="6.03">problem and think about all those people</text>
  <text start="471.88" dur="5.37">who are trying now who I mean let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="475.48" dur="4.26">think about this those people who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="477.25" dur="5.58">those people who have reduced hours are</text>
  <text start="479.74" dur="5.13">making less money still have to go out</text>
  <text start="482.83" dur="5.45">and buy health insurance or get taxed</text>
  <text start="484.87" dur="6.45">now so if they are going to get text or</text>
  <text start="488.28" dur="6.55">buy health insurance they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="491.32" dur="5.22">to go out and spend it on retail they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="494.83" dur="8.85">going to use that money and spend it in</text>
  <text start="496.54" dur="12.93">another way so the entire economy is</text>
  <text start="503.68" dur="7.89">going to completely shift and our money</text>
  <text start="509.47" dur="4.68">is going to be spent on something</text>
  <text start="511.57" dur="6.36">totally different now and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="514.15" dur="7.26">see a dramatic change in the spending of</text>
  <text start="517.93" dur="6.45">the middle class and lower class people</text>
  <text start="521.41" dur="7.65">and that&amp;#39;s going to really affect the</text>
  <text start="524.38" dur="6.51">economy so and if we look further you</text>
  <text start="529.06" dur="3.84">know they talk about these job numbers</text>
  <text start="530.89" dur="4.38">and everyone&amp;#39;s applauding and the</text>
  <text start="532.9" dur="6.57">markets going up and you know the Dow</text>
  <text start="535.27" dur="6.39">went over 15,000 and SP went over 1600</text>
  <text start="539.47" dur="4.26">and everyone&amp;#39;s going this is fantastic</text>
  <text start="541.66" dur="4.32">and great but when we look at the job</text>

  <text start="545.98" dur="4.86">all the jobs like what jobs so if you</text>
  <text start="548.74" dur="5.06">break it down forty-three percent or</text>

  <text start="624.11" dur="7.89">that people used to have so where where</text>
  <text start="630.05" dur="5.22">are all the great jobs that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="632" dur="6.8">talking about and then I went I was</text>
  <text start="635.27" dur="7.83">thinking to myself what did the</text>
  <text start="638.8" dur="6.85">unemployment look like right before 2008</text>
  <text start="643.1" dur="4.29">and what did the graph look like you</text>
  <text start="645.65" dur="3.87">know prior to that you know where they</text>
  <text start="647.39" dur="3.84">were saying everything was great nothing</text>
  <text start="649.52" dur="4.29">to worry about he was telling us that</text>
  <text start="651.23" dur="5.04">everything&amp;#39;s contained before 2008 and</text>
  <text start="653.81" dur="7.65">even if we go back before 2001 what</text>
  <text start="656.27" dur="6.48">happened so from 1992 it looks like we</text>
  <text start="661.46" dur="4.02">almost hit eighty eight percent</text>
  <text start="662.75" dur="7.38">unemployment and it came down all the</text>
  <text start="665.48" dur="8.37">way up until 2000 2001 down to four</text>
  <text start="670.13" dur="7.02">percent and then it went back up to six</text>
  <text start="673.85" dur="8.16">point one percent and then the Fed</text>
  <text start="677.15" dur="8.1">slowly brought the unemployment down to</text>
  <text start="682.01" dur="7.13">about four point three percent in 2008</text>
  <text start="685.25" dur="7.59">and then when the 2008</text>
  <text start="689.14" dur="4.93">2009 crash happened it shot up to ten</text>
  <text start="692.84" dur="5.6">percent and then they change the</text>
  <text start="694.07" dur="6.87">calculation and now the unemployment</text>
  <text start="698.44" dur="6.37">continually is sliding down going from</text>
  <text start="700.94" dur="6.24">10 to eight 27.5 where we are and if you</text>
  <text start="704.81" dur="5.85">look at this graph you can definitely</text>
  <text start="707.18" dur="5.64">see a pattern of unemployment how it</text>
  <text start="710.66" dur="5.61">comes down crash it goes back up it</text>
  <text start="712.82" dur="5.85">comes down crash it went way up it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="716.27" dur="4.62">coming down now and then we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="718.67" dur="4.89">see a crash and it&amp;#39;s going to go way way</text>
  <text start="720.89" dur="6.72">way up and I if they didn&amp;#39;t change this</text>
  <text start="723.56" dur="7.86">calculation this unemployment figure we</text>
  <text start="727.61" dur="8.52">could would still be going up so this</text>
  <text start="731.42" dur="7.2">crash is going to be 10 tons forget a</text>
  <text start="736.13" dur="5.01">hundred times worse because of what they</text>
  <text start="738.62" dur="5.76">done and how they change this I also put</text>
  <text start="741.14" dur="6.57">the document from the government on my</text>
  <text start="744.38" dur="8.91">page to show you the calculation and the</text>
  <text start="747.71" dur="9.87">exact unemployment numbers so let&amp;#39;s move</text>

  <text start="780.589" dur="5.641">the new government that we set up I</text>
  <text start="784.19" dur="4.14">guess they&amp;#39;re not an agreement with that</text>

  <text start="1088.57" dur="10.849">I and to send them off now moving on I</text>
  <text start="1095.049" dur="9.271">was thinking about the stock market the</text>
  <text start="1099.419" dur="7.031">bail ins the pensions and everything</text>
  <text start="1104.32" dur="8.64">that they had planned now hear me out on</text>
  <text start="1106.45" dur="10.229">this Jim Rogers Peter Schiff believe</text>
  <text start="1112.96" dur="7.219">that the United States is going to be</text>
  <text start="1116.679" dur="8.061">coming after the people&amp;#39;s pensions okay</text>
  <text start="1120.179" dur="10">now in Cyprus we saw the balance we saw</text>
  <text start="1124.74" dur="9.88">the unsecured the uninsured monies of</text>
  <text start="1130.179" dur="8.551">the people that money was taken from</text>
  <text start="1134.62" dur="7.95">them and replaced with stocks Jim Rogers</text>
  <text start="1138.73" dur="6.6">is saying the next act is for pensions</text>
  <text start="1142.57" dur="6.3">and we saw in President Obama&amp;#39;s budget</text>
  <text start="1145.33" dur="5.79">that you know he was going after IRAs</text>
  <text start="1148.87" dur="5.939">where if you had too much money in the</text>
  <text start="1151.12" dur="5.46">IRA that you would do anything above</text>
  <text start="1154.809" dur="5.57">that amount i think was three million</text>
  <text start="1156.58" dur="6.78">would be put into a special governmental</text>
  <text start="1160.379" dur="4.66">retirement where you you put money in</text>
  <text start="1163.36" dur="8.029">there and it would be replaced by</text>
  <text start="1165.039" dur="11.27">Treasury bonds but the Fed is printing</text>
  <text start="1171.389" dur="9.101">money and giving money to the banks to</text>
  <text start="1176.309" dur="7.48">invest in the stock market now the stock</text>
  <text start="1180.49" dur="8.13">market we see the Dow at 15,000 and the</text>
  <text start="1183.789" dur="7.441">SP at 1,600 now as they keep doing this</text>
  <text start="1188.62" dur="7.11">what else is happening I mean what else</text>
  <text start="1191.23" dur="8.549">do we know we know from the market going</text>
  <text start="1195.73" dur="6.449">up everyone&amp;#39;s pensions because most of</text>
  <text start="1199.779" dur="5.431">the pensions are invested in the stock I</text>
  <text start="1202.179" dur="7.021">know mine is and it&amp;#39;s going up is going</text>
  <text start="1205.21" dur="6.48">up dramatically and the investments are</text>
  <text start="1209.2" dur="5.37">doing very well because you know they</text>
  <text start="1211.69" dur="6.479">keep the Fed is funding this and the</text>
  <text start="1214.57" dur="6.52">market keeps rising what if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1218.169" dur="5.441">doing this on purpose</text>
  <text start="1221.09" dur="5.07">making now think about what Jim Rogers</text>
  <text start="1223.61" dur="5.73">said they&amp;#39;re coming after our pensions</text>
  <text start="1226.16" dur="6.78">if the market was down and they just let</text>
  <text start="1229.34" dur="7.71">it fall to nothing what would be in</text>
  <text start="1232.94" dur="9.69">those pension accounts nothing since the</text>
  <text start="1237.05" dur="8.93">market is rising to these these highs</text>
  <text start="1242.63" dur="9.87">that we&amp;#39;ve never ever seen before all</text>
  <text start="1245.98" dur="10.63">pension plans are moving to highs that</text>
  <text start="1252.5" dur="7.26">they have never seen before so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1256.61" dur="9.75">thinking about this that this is being</text>
  <text start="1259.76" dur="9.87">done for a purpose not just the the the</text>
  <text start="1266.36" dur="9.44">pump and dump in the market but the pump</text>
  <text start="1269.63" dur="9.03">up take the money from the pensions</text>
  <text start="1275.8" dur="5.86">because of what they&amp;#39;re doing so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1278.66" dur="7.82">pumping the more stock market up to</text>
  <text start="1281.66" dur="11.51">build the pensions and they are going to</text>
  <text start="1286.48" dur="10.27">take all that profit from the pensions</text>
  <text start="1293.17" dur="7.26">to bail out the government and the banks</text>
  <text start="1296.75" dur="7.32">and whatever they need the money for and</text>
  <text start="1300.43" dur="7.74">we can see this happening because even</text>
  <text start="1304.07" dur="6.66">though they have the FDIC Bank angle</text>
  <text start="1308.17" dur="4.21">document and they did the test in Cyprus</text>
  <text start="1310.73" dur="7.82">and other countries are also doing the</text>
  <text start="1312.38" dur="6.17">same balon type of documents we can see</text>
  <text start="1318.7" dur="5.65">that it would be much easier and I and I</text>
  <text start="1321.77" dur="6.24">do agree with Jim Rogers on this if they</text>
  <text start="1324.35" dur="5.94">went after the pensions first because</text>
  <text start="1328.01" dur="6.05">people&amp;#39;s pensions first of all they</text>
  <text start="1330.29" dur="7.89">really can&amp;#39;t access it yet second of all</text>
  <text start="1334.06" dur="6.85">people would be like the sleeping people</text>
  <text start="1338.18" dur="5.55">of America be like okay they replaced it</text>
  <text start="1340.91" dur="5.01">with you know Treasury bonds or stocks</text>
  <text start="1343.73" dur="6.12">from the bay whatever they replace it</text>
  <text start="1345.92" dur="7.75">with but it seems like they are pumping</text>
  <text start="1349.85" dur="8.08">the market up to pump the pensions up</text>
  <text start="1353.67" dur="7.92">so there&amp;#39;s money in the accounts for</text>
  <text start="1357.93" dur="6.6">them to take once they take the pensions</text>
  <text start="1361.59" dur="6.33">they see how the people react they can</text>
  <text start="1364.53" dur="5.34">move in and swoop down to the ballon of</text>
  <text start="1367.92" dur="3.93">the bank because I&amp;#39;m going to tell you</text>
  <text start="1369.87" dur="3.54">right now the percentage that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1371.85" dur="5.28">going to take from the pensions will</text>
  <text start="1373.41" dur="6.09">probably be not enough to support what</text>
  <text start="1377.13" dur="3.51">they want to do and that&amp;#39;s when the end</text>
  <text start="1379.5" dur="4.83">this Hut you can see this throughout</text>
  <text start="1380.64" dur="5.67">history you know they start with</text>
  <text start="1384.33" dur="4.89">something just like you know taxing the</text>
  <text start="1386.31" dur="5.85">rich and they say that&amp;#39;s all we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1389.22" dur="4.95">to do and over time they say oh the</text>
  <text start="1392.16" dur="3.21">taxing the rich didn&amp;#39;t work now we have</text>
  <text start="1394.17" dur="3.12">to take it from the rest of the people</text>
  <text start="1395.37" dur="5.04">well we&amp;#39;re just going to do this the one</text>
  <text start="1397.29" dur="6.87">time on your pension accounts and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1400.41" dur="6.39">all we need a couple months later that</text>
  <text start="1404.16" dur="4.44">wasn&amp;#39;t enough we couldn&amp;#39;t really you</text>
  <text start="1406.8" dur="4.08">know that the amount of funds there</text>
  <text start="1408.6" dur="6.15">wasn&amp;#39;t enough so now we have to move in</text>
  <text start="1410.88" dur="5.97">and do the balance so it looks like this</text>
  <text start="1414.75" dur="3.78">is where they&amp;#39;re headed and it looks</text>
  <text start="1416.85" dur="5.85">like this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="1418.53" dur="6.48">for those people please comment on what</text>
