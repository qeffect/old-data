  <text start="101.6" dur="4.32">switch the narrative that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="103.549" dur="4.52">responsible for any of this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="105.92" dur="5.309">actually the people that&amp;#39;s the problem</text>

  <text start="113.689" dur="6.801">the central bankers we had nothing to do</text>
  <text start="115.399" dur="11.97">with this and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="120.49" dur="9.39">Draghi Yellin and all the others they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="127.369" dur="6.811">trying to plan past the blame onto</text>
  <text start="129.88" dur="6.1">Congress it&amp;#39;s all Congress&amp;#39;s fault its</text>
  <text start="134.18" dur="3.93">Congress who is listening to the people</text>
  <text start="135.98" dur="5.67">it is their fault that the economy is</text>
  <text start="138.11" dur="7.32">doing what it is doing right now and you</text>
  <text start="141.65" dur="5.49">have to remember the president the Fed</text>
  <text start="145.43" dur="3.86">they&amp;#39;ve been out there continually</text>
  <text start="147.14" dur="4.56">telling us that the economy is improving</text>
  <text start="149.29" dur="5.59">Europe is improving the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="151.7" dur="5.49">improving and now we see something</text>
  <text start="154.88" dur="4.859">different happening where they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="157.19" dur="7.34">to change the story and try to place</text>
  <text start="159.739" dur="8.341">blame on everyone else but themselves</text>
  <text start="164.53" dur="7.12">and we can see right now that in the</text>
  <text start="168.08" dur="6.36">last eight years central planning hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="171.65" dur="5.76">worked the global central banks have</text>

  <text start="177.41" dur="7.17">maintained zero or negative interest</text>
  <text start="179.45" dur="8.43">rates and we can see what has happened</text>

  <text start="187.88" dur="5.25">talking about now is more quantitative</text>
  <text start="190.64" dur="4.17">easing they&amp;#39;re talking about more</text>

  <text start="235.28" dur="5.64">tax increases a wealth tax the</text>
  <text start="239.15" dur="4.2">government going after pensions and</text>
  <text start="240.92" dur="4.02">we&amp;#39;re already seeing a wealth tax in</text>
  <text start="243.35" dur="4.11">different countries like India where</text>
  <text start="244.94" dur="5.07">everyone has to gather up their entire</text>
  <text start="247.46" dur="5.04">wealth and then there&amp;#39;s a percentage on</text>
  <text start="250.01" dur="5.07">their wealth each year and we know the</text>
  <text start="252.5" dur="5.31">IMF is been talking about a wealth tax</text>

  <text start="260.989" dur="4.261">is not just for the wealthy this is</text>
  <text start="263.24" dur="3.57">going to be for everyone where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="265.25" dur="3.63">going to have to add up their entire</text>
  <text start="266.81" dur="4.38">wealth and give her percentage actually</text>
  <text start="268.88" dur="5.82">Greece is moving in that direction right</text>
  <text start="271.19" dur="7.5">now he&amp;#39;s all he&amp;#39;s also talking about the</text>
  <text start="274.7" dur="5.4">government going after tensions and he</text>
  <text start="278.69" dur="4.44">said most Americans are going to be</text>
  <text start="280.1" dur="7.47">really shocked when the government talks</text>
  <text start="283.13" dur="6.09">about retroactive taxes and goes back in</text>
  <text start="287.57" dur="4.77">time and says we need to play place</text>
  <text start="289.22" dur="6.42">taxes in the past bring them forward and</text>
  <text start="292.34" dur="5.03">now you owe this amount of money and he</text>
  <text start="295.64" dur="2.8">says this is a form of financial</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="4.37">Marshall</text>
  <text start="298.44" dur="5.46">law and why are they will do why are</text>
  <text start="301.74" dur="6.09">they doing this right now because they</text>
  <text start="303.9" dur="8.36">have run out of ammunition right now we</text>
  <text start="307.83" dur="7.29">can see that the Fed if they increase</text>
  <text start="312.26" dur="5.47">the interest rates like they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="315.12" dur="5.61">talking about I&amp;#39;ve said this in the past</text>
  <text start="317.73" dur="5.46">and other reports this is a sign that</text>
  <text start="320.73" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re ready to bring down the entire</text>
  <text start="323.19" dur="4.08">system now people say well if they raise</text>
  <text start="325.62" dur="3.36">the interest rate you mean that same day</text>
  <text start="327.27" dur="3.93">the entire market and everything is</text>
  <text start="328.98" dur="4.98">going to crash know if they do that</text>
  <text start="331.2" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re going to be to blame but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="333.96" dur="4.26">going to do is they&amp;#39;re going to bring up</text>
  <text start="335.85" dur="4.98">the interest rates and a month or two</text>
  <text start="338.22" dur="5.3">later all of a sudden tied with another</text>
  <text start="340.83" dur="6.62">event everything will come crashing down</text>
  <text start="343.52" dur="7.51">now they did the first increase of</text>
  <text start="347.45" dur="6.55">interest rates couple months ago I</text>
  <text start="351.03" dur="4.98">almost almost a year ago now and they</text>
  <text start="354" dur="3.75">might be getting ready now to increase</text>
  <text start="356.01" dur="4.56">it once again and this would be the</text>
  <text start="357.75" dur="4.44">signal so what they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="360.57" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re going to say the economy is</text>
  <text start="362.19" dur="6.36">strong enough let&amp;#39;s increase the</text>
  <text start="365.19" dur="5.37">interest rates now other countries other</text>
  <text start="368.55" dur="4.95">central banks there in the negative</text>
  <text start="370.56" dur="4.47">territory and we know that raising the</text>
  <text start="373.5" dur="3.27">interest rates it&amp;#39;s not going to help</text>
  <text start="375.03" dur="4.53">the situation it&amp;#39;s going to make the</text>
  <text start="376.77" dur="6.09">situation even worse and they know this</text>
  <text start="379.56" dur="4.59">and what we&amp;#39;ll do is once they raise the</text>
  <text start="382.86" dur="4.2">interest rates maybe a month or two</text>
  <text start="384.15" dur="5.85">later but this event that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="387.06" dur="4.859">occur they will say oh we were improving</text>
  <text start="390" dur="3.93">because they&amp;#39;ll manipulate the</text>
  <text start="391.919" dur="4.351">improvement because in the short period</text>
  <text start="393.93" dur="4.5">of time we&amp;#39;ll see a little jump and</text>
  <text start="396.27" dur="4.53">things will start to improve but things</text>
  <text start="398.43" dur="3.63">will start to slide and this is where</text>
  <text start="400.8" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re going to have the problem and</text>
  <text start="402.06" dur="4.26">this is why they&amp;#39;re going to need the</text>
  <text start="403.86" dur="5.43">event and once the event happens we</text>
  <text start="406.32" dur="5.7">already know from the central banks are</text>
  <text start="409.29" dur="4.23">talking about more QE because they had a</text>
  <text start="412.02" dur="3.33">report that came out and said listen if</text>
  <text start="413.52" dur="5.37">there&amp;#39;s an economic shock we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="415.35" dur="5.55">have to increase quantitative easing up</text>
  <text start="418.89" dur="3.3">to maybe four trillion which I think</text>
  <text start="420.9" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s going to be much much more than</text>
  <text start="422.19" dur="6.42">that and then once this event occurs QE</text>
  <text start="426.3" dur="4.31">starts they&amp;#39;re going to say listen we</text>
  <text start="428.61" dur="3.239">need to go deep into negative territory</text>
  <text start="430.61" dur="2.889">with</text>
  <text start="431.849" dur="3.57">interest rates and we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="433.499" dur="4.831">central banks around the world bring it</text>
  <text start="435.419" dur="5.43">down even further and this will be the</text>
  <text start="438.33" dur="4.44">beginning of this entire system crashing</text>
  <text start="440.849" dur="4.71">because you have to remember they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="442.77" dur="5.399">been telling us all along that the</text>
  <text start="445.559" dur="5.82">economy has been improving but if we</text>
  <text start="448.169" dur="5.25">look at the facts like the Institute of</text>
  <text start="451.379" dur="6.18">Supply Management the is a manufacturing</text>
  <text start="453.419" dur="7.92">report its plunge by 49.4 in August from</text>

  <text start="461.339" dur="7.47">non-manufacturing report when from 55.5</text>
  <text start="466.05" dur="5.969">to 51.4 the slowest growth since</text>
  <text start="468.809" dur="6.931">februari of 2010 we see the August non</text>
  <text start="472.019" dur="7.65">non farm payrolls came in well below the</text>
  <text start="475.74" dur="8.149">150 1000 jobs we see that construction</text>
  <text start="479.669" dur="7.2">manufacturing losing jobs like crazy</text>
  <text start="483.889" dur="5.02">construction spending is slowing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="486.869" dur="4.86">seeing delinquencies in auto loans</text>
  <text start="488.909" dur="6.36">rising we&amp;#39;re seeing corporate defaults</text>
  <text start="491.729" dur="6.72">rising these are not the signs of a</text>
  <text start="495.269" dur="5.61">roaring economy these are signs of an</text>
  <text start="498.449" dur="4.981">economy that is contracting that is</text>
  <text start="500.879" dur="3.93">falling apart that&amp;#39;s imploding so we can</text>
  <text start="503.43" dur="5.879">see they&amp;#39;re already preparing and</text>
  <text start="504.809" dur="8.551">getting ready for this now we see out in</text>
  <text start="509.309" dur="7.02">North Korea North Korea allegedly had</text>
  <text start="513.36" dur="5.149">this nuclear test and we see that</text>
  <text start="516.329" dur="4.95">Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov</text>
  <text start="518.509" dur="4.871">he&amp;#39;s out there he condemns the North</text>
  <text start="521.279" dur="4.92">Korean nuclear test and of course China</text>
  <text start="523.38" dur="5.22">does too because they&amp;#39;re trying to step</text>
  <text start="526.199" dur="4.231">away from the situation and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="528.6" dur="2.94">want to be involved with North Korea</text>
  <text start="530.43" dur="2.399">because we can see the United States</text>
  <text start="531.54" dur="3.51">government central bankers are trying to</text>
  <text start="532.829" dur="4.081">provoke North Korea into doing something</text>
  <text start="535.05" dur="3.599">and they want to place more and more</text>
  <text start="536.91" dur="4.95">sanctions on North Korea to try to</text>
  <text start="538.649" dur="4.5">squeeze them and we can see that Sergey</text>
  <text start="541.86" dur="3.69">Lavrov is out there saying listen</text>
  <text start="543.149" dur="5.851">sanctions don&amp;#39;t work there has to be a</text>
  <text start="545.55" dur="5.43">more creative way of dealing with North</text>
  <text start="549" dur="4.259">Korea but maybe we should have talks</text>
  <text start="550.98" dur="4.859">with them maybe we should approach them</text>
  <text start="553.259" dur="3.871">and discuss what&amp;#39;s going on but you have</text>
  <text start="555.839" dur="3.36">to remember the United States government</text>
  <text start="557.13" dur="4.559">central bankers when North Korea</text>
  <text start="559.199" dur="4.921">proposed this the United States says</text>
  <text start="561.689" dur="4.051">there&amp;#39;s going to be no talks we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="564.12" dur="3.45">talking we&amp;#39;re bringing in military</text>
  <text start="565.74" dur="4.02">into South Korea we&amp;#39;re bringing in the</text>
  <text start="567.57" dur="4.53">fab missile system we&amp;#39;re not talking</text>
  <text start="569.76" dur="3.75">there&amp;#39;s no negotiation the only time</text>
  <text start="572.1" dur="4.71">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="573.51" dur="5.52">seem to negotiate with countries or</text>
  <text start="576.81" dur="5.25">situations is when they&amp;#39;re on the losing</text>
  <text start="579.03" dur="5.04">end when they see oh we have a problem</text>
  <text start="582.06" dur="4.89">here we beat we better calm this down</text>
  <text start="584.07" dur="6.53">and we better have a discussion to</text>
  <text start="586.95" dur="5.94">reinforce our troops to reinforce our</text>
  <text start="590.6" dur="5.35">military assets and that&amp;#39;s what we</text>
  <text start="592.89" dur="4.86">always say and we see North Korea an</text>
  <text start="595.95" dur="4.77">official from North Korea came out and</text>
  <text start="597.75" dur="5.3">said listen North Korea should be</text>
  <text start="600.72" dur="6.36">recognized right now as a legitimate</text>
  <text start="603.05" dur="5.32">nuclear weapon holding country and of</text>
  <text start="607.08" dur="4.32">course the United States doesn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="608.37" dur="4.62">do this because the United States wants</text>
  <text start="611.4" dur="4.47">to go into North Korea and actually have</text>
  <text start="612.99" dur="4.71">a regime change or provoke war in this</text>
  <text start="615.87" dur="3.99">country and they don&amp;#39;t like to go into</text>
  <text start="617.7" dur="4.56">countries where they have nuclear</text>
  <text start="619.86" dur="4.67">weapons that&amp;#39;s not really their modus</text>
  <text start="622.26" dur="5.31">operandi they don&amp;#39;t like to do that and</text>
  <text start="624.53" dur="4.27">we can see at this point that the United</text>
  <text start="627.57" dur="3.96">States government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="628.8" dur="8.06">going to continually push war all around</text>
  <text start="631.53" dur="10.17">the globe out in Libya we see that the</text>
  <text start="636.86" dur="7.6">unity government is moving in on all the</text>
  <text start="641.7" dur="5.58">oil ports they&amp;#39;re trying to control all</text>
  <text start="644.46" dur="4.38">of those regions and of course what</text>
  <text start="647.28" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re really trying to do here in this</text>
  <text start="648.84" dur="5.61">country is they&amp;#39;re trying to capture the</text>
  <text start="651.81" dur="5.73">oil fields the oil ports they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="654.45" dur="4.92">to maintain control of the oil they</text>
  <text start="657.54" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t care about the people and we can</text>
  <text start="659.37" dur="3.81">see right now that there are three</text>

  <text start="668.01" dur="4.95">even want the United States the UN the</text>
  <text start="671.1" dur="3.42">coalition forces decided what government</text>
  <text start="672.96" dur="3.27">the people are going to have and we can</text>
  <text start="674.52" dur="4.23">see this is the battle right now the</text>
  <text start="676.23" dur="5.34">battle is against the central bankers</text>
  <text start="678.75" dur="5.22">and the people and what they really want</text>
  <text start="681.57" dur="5.79">in this country while this is going on</text>
  <text start="683.97" dur="7.32">the central bankers are trying to</text>
  <text start="687.36" dur="6.24">capture all the assets of the country</text>
  <text start="691.29" dur="5.64">and the assets that is the oil and</text>
  <text start="693.6" dur="5.99">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ve been trying to do we</text>
  <text start="696.93" dur="6.45">see out in Aleppo in Syria</text>
  <text start="699.59" dur="7.75">the last remaining senior medic was</text>
  <text start="703.38" dur="7.56">killed by the u.s. back rebels and we</text>
  <text start="707.34" dur="7.71">can see right now that the US and Russia</text>
  <text start="710.94" dur="7.05">decided to calm the situation down to</text>
  <text start="715.05" dur="5.55">have a ceasefire is this permanent peace</text>
  <text start="717.99" dur="5.7">well no we&amp;#39;ve seen this fail time and</text>
  <text start="720.6" dur="4.89">time again and parts of the deal they</text>
  <text start="723.69" dur="3.65">have remained secret because you have to</text>
  <text start="725.49" dur="4.8">remember everything leading up to this</text>
  <text start="727.34" dur="5.56">al-nusrah and the moderate rebels were</text>
  <text start="730.29" dur="4.92">intertwined they were as one Russia kept</text>
  <text start="732.9" dur="4.83">on saying while al-nusrah al-qaeda they</text>
  <text start="735.21" dur="3.99">are a terrorist group you need to</text>
  <text start="737.73" dur="4.1">separate them and of course the United</text>
  <text start="739.2" dur="5.69">States government central bankers they</text>
  <text start="741.83" dur="6.94">stalled and stalled and stalled and</text>
  <text start="744.89" dur="5.11">eventually russia decided in syria</text>
  <text start="748.77" dur="2.94">decided you know what we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="750" dur="4.5">hitting the terrorists and this is the</text>
  <text start="751.71" dur="5.64">US as problem because they sold stalled</text>
  <text start="754.5" dur="5.19">for all of these months because they</text>
  <text start="757.35" dur="5.58">really didn&amp;#39;t want to do it but what</text>
  <text start="759.69" dur="8.01">they&amp;#39;ve seen in syria is that they were</text>
  <text start="762.93" dur="7.23">losing Syria Russia they&amp;#39;ve been pushing</text>
  <text start="767.7" dur="4.98">the Islamic state out of Syria coming</text>
  <text start="770.16" dur="5.37">after al-qaeda after al-nusrah and then</text>
  <text start="772.68" dur="6.18">we had a name change and then all of a</text>
  <text start="775.53" dur="4.74">sudden the US and the moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="778.86" dur="3.54">and their terrorist groups which are all</text>
  <text start="780.27" dur="3.69">one in the same they decided to have a</text>
  <text start="782.4" dur="3.84">name change and separate themselves from</text>
  <text start="783.96" dur="4.68">al-qaeda and this way they&amp;#39;re no longer</text>
  <text start="786.24" dur="4.35">on the UN terrorist list and they</text>
  <text start="788.64" dur="3.48">thought oh this will be it listen you</text>
  <text start="790.59" dur="4.2">can&amp;#39;t bomb them because they&amp;#39;re not on</text>
  <text start="792.12" dur="4.11">the UN terrorist list but Sergei Lavrov</text>
  <text start="794.79" dur="2.94">from Russia said it doesn&amp;#39;t matter how</text>
  <text start="796.23" dur="5.04">many times you change your name you are</text>
  <text start="797.73" dur="5.19">the same group you are terrorists so the</text>
  <text start="801.27" dur="4.11">u.s. went in and said listen we need to</text>
  <text start="802.92" dur="5.52">buy some time here we can&amp;#39;t have them</text>
  <text start="805.38" dur="5.75">destroy the terrorist groups the</text>
  <text start="808.44" dur="6.48">moderate rebels because we&amp;#39;re losing an</text>
  <text start="811.13" dur="6.07">11-hour stands right now so every time</text>
  <text start="814.92" dur="5.67">the US loses then they need some time</text>
  <text start="817.2" dur="4.8">they push a ceasefire deal and this is</text>
  <text start="820.59" dur="4.29">exactly what&amp;#39;s happening that parts of</text>
  <text start="822" dur="4.65">it are secret most likely it has to do</text>
  <text start="824.88" dur="3.66">with the terrorist groups and what</text>
  <text start="826.65" dur="3.3">russia&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t to do with them and they</text>
  <text start="828.54" dur="3.69">didn&amp;#39;t want this information coming out</text>
  <text start="829.95" dur="3.03">because of course this would be damaging</text>
  <text start="832.23" dur="3.799">to the</text>
  <text start="832.98" dur="6.539">us and I see this was part of the deal</text>
  <text start="836.029" dur="6.641">and we can see right now that this most</text>
  <text start="839.519" dur="5.791">likely is a stall tactic by the u.s. to</text>
  <text start="842.67" dur="5.37">bring in more military assets to bring</text>
  <text start="845.31" dur="6">in more troops to have Turkey position</text>
  <text start="848.04" dur="5.76">itself and will this last most likely</text>
  <text start="851.31" dur="6.99">not because their goal again is always</text>
  <text start="853.8" dur="7.2">let&amp;#39;s get Assad then move into Iran that</text>
  <text start="858.3" dur="3.87">has been the goal from the beginning now</text>
  <text start="861" dur="3.11">the Syrian government is saying they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="862.17" dur="4.83">going to be supporting the ceasefire and</text>
  <text start="864.11" dur="4.63">we can see the US came out and they told</text>
  <text start="867" dur="3.449">their rebels that listen if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="868.74" dur="4.589">attacked you&amp;#39;re allowed to use</text>
  <text start="870.449" dur="4.111">self-defense so of course every time the</text>
  <text start="873.329" dur="3.141">moderate rebels the terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="874.56" dur="5.19">attack they&amp;#39;re going to say it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="876.47" dur="5.44">self-defense and this is what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="879.75" dur="3.6">always done in the past and we can see</text>
  <text start="881.91" dur="3.09">right now they&amp;#39;re going to be doing in</text>
  <text start="883.35" dur="4.38">the future and I don&amp;#39;t think these</text>
  <text start="885" dur="4.68">ceasefire talks are gonna work out</text>
  <text start="887.73" dur="4.2">because the United States government</text>
  <text start="889.68" dur="3.48">central bankers they don&amp;#39;t give up we</text>
  <text start="891.93" dur="3.75">saw what happened before when there was</text>
  <text start="893.16" dur="4.409">a ceasefire they brought in thousands</text>
  <text start="895.68" dur="4.11">upon thousands of more terrorists into</text>
  <text start="897.569" dur="5.911">this region right now we have turkey</text>
  <text start="899.79" dur="6.06">inside of Syria carving out a certain</text>
  <text start="903.48" dur="4.589">area for a safe zone and exclusive zone</text>
  <text start="905.85" dur="6.539">and we can see this is all part of their</text>
  <text start="908.069" dur="8.101">plan and right now this ceasefire is a</text>
  <text start="912.389" dur="6.481">complete stall tactic now very</text>
  <text start="916.17" dur="5.46">interestingly we know there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="918.87" dur="4.37">be this great battle in my soul and to</text>
  <text start="921.63" dur="4.35">get rid of the Islamic state of course</text>
  <text start="923.24" dur="4.329">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="925.98" dur="6.03">is that the United States is continually</text>
  <text start="927.569" dur="10.101">having more combat ready Marines come</text>
  <text start="932.01" dur="11.79">into Iraq and they are planning on this</text>
  <text start="937.67" dur="9.43">invasion during the election period the</text>
  <text start="943.8" dur="5.519">end of October going into November now</text>
  <text start="947.1" dur="5.46">what does this really mean because this</text>
  <text start="949.319" dur="8.7">is a very large-scale offensive with US</text>
  <text start="952.56" dur="8.19">troops inside of Iraq will they say an</text>
  <text start="958.019" dur="5.01">event has occurred will something happen</text>
  <text start="960.75" dur="3.18">during this period because it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="963.029" dur="3.171">interesting that they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="963.93" dur="4.79">doing it at the same exact time</text>
  <text start="966.2" dur="6.3">as the elections are going on because we</text>
  <text start="968.72" dur="5.67">know with these elections if the elite</text>
  <text start="972.5" dur="4.56">do not get the person they want in</text>
  <text start="974.39" dur="4.02">office they will postpone in there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="977.06" dur="6.3">many different ways they can postpone</text>
  <text start="978.41" dur="7.35">this it could be a national emergency it</text>
  <text start="983.36" dur="3.81">could be something with Zika virus it</text>
  <text start="985.76" dur="3.27">could be the health of one of the</text>
  <text start="987.17" dur="4.77">candidates because we&amp;#39;ve seen that</text>
  <text start="989.03" dur="5.04">Clinton apparently she has some type of</text>
  <text start="991.94" dur="5.34">health problems today at the 911</text>
  <text start="994.07" dur="5.4">memorial she kind of passed out and they</text>
  <text start="997.28" dur="5.12">had a rusher off they can say we can</text>
  <text start="999.47" dur="7.59">postpone it with that there could be an</text>
  <text start="1002.4" dur="7.96">economic problem in the country there</text>
  <text start="1007.06" dur="5.22">can be an event that can occur so when</text>
  <text start="1010.36" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;re looking at this situation they</text>
  <text start="1012.28" dur="6.3">have been looking at every angle making</text>
  <text start="1015.7" dur="5.67">sure that they&amp;#39;re prepared to postpone</text>
  <text start="1018.58" dur="6.06">this election if it doesn&amp;#39;t go the way</text>
  <text start="1021.37" dur="5.88">they want and we have to remember things</text>
