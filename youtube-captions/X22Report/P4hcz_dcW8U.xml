  <text start="70.409" dur="6.871">in the last couple of days we have seen</text>
  <text start="72.9" dur="7.92">the market really fluctuate and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="77.28" dur="7.32">amazing what the high-frequency traders</text>
  <text start="80.82" dur="7.229">and the plunge protection team can do to</text>

  <text start="88.049" dur="5.881">system buy stocks and push this market</text>
  <text start="91.65" dur="5.609">up I mean we&amp;#39;ve seen days where the</text>
  <text start="93.93" dur="5.609">market is falling 300 points plus and</text>
  <text start="97.259" dur="3.921">then we&amp;#39;ve seen the high-frequency</text>
  <text start="99.539" dur="6.54">traders the plunge protection team</text>
  <text start="101.18" dur="6.96">slowly bring the market back up and we</text>
  <text start="106.079" dur="5.07">are seeing this more and more often</text>
  <text start="108.14" dur="6.089">today the market is pretty much didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="111.149" dur="6.33">go anywhere today but we are seeing this</text>
  <text start="114.229" dur="5.771">from August into September and now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="117.479" dur="5.82">in October and I believe we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="120" dur="7.71">see a lot more of this as time goes on</text>
  <text start="123.299" dur="7.74">and the reason for this is because what</text>
  <text start="127.71" dur="6.21">we are looking at right now is a system</text>
  <text start="131.039" dur="5.191">that is completely just falling apart</text>
  <text start="133.92" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s breaking apart they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="136.23" dur="3.99">keep it together and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="138.45" dur="4.2">keep everyone in the solution that</text>
  <text start="140.22" dur="5.31">everything is fine and as more and more</text>
  <text start="142.65" dur="5.07">economic data comes out and as we look</text>
  <text start="145.53" dur="5.46">further and further into it we know and</text>
  <text start="147.72" dur="5.76">we&amp;#39;ve noticed that things are really not</text>
  <text start="150.99" dur="4.02">making sense anymore I mean in Europe</text>
  <text start="153.48" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re continually telling everyone</text>
  <text start="155.01" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s everything&amp;#39;s fine the ECB is</text>
  <text start="157.53" dur="4.05">going to create more money don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="159.54" dur="4.02">about all those people that don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="161.58" dur="2.83">jobs don&amp;#39;t worry that the youth</text>
  <text start="163.56" dur="4.24">unemployment</text>
  <text start="164.41" dur="5.64">you know as 50 plus percent it makes no</text>
  <text start="167.8" dur="4.74">difference at this point in time don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="170.05" dur="3.93">look if these nations are in so much</text>
  <text start="172.54" dur="4.89">debt that they can&amp;#39;t get themselves out</text>
  <text start="173.98" dur="6.39">of debt it&amp;#39;s meaningless and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="177.43" dur="5.43">starting to see that Germany is starting</text>
  <text start="180.37" dur="4.62">to folder right now where their factory</text>
  <text start="182.86" dur="5.52">orders are starting to fall global their</text>
  <text start="184.99" dur="6.99">global growth is slowing at this point</text>
  <text start="188.38" dur="5.91">and this is all happening without the</text>
  <text start="191.98" dur="5.1">gigantic scandal a Volkswagen right now</text>
  <text start="194.29" dur="6.42">I mean this is not even included in that</text>
  <text start="197.08" dur="7.56">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that this scandal will</text>
  <text start="200.71" dur="7.29">bring down the German economy even</text>
  <text start="204.64" dur="6.36">further and it will slow factory orders</text>
  <text start="208" dur="5.64">even further this is not going to help</text>
  <text start="211" dur="6.8">Germany whatsoever this is not going to</text>
  <text start="213.64" dur="8.82">help the European economies whatsoever</text>
  <text start="217.8" dur="11.11">when we look at the u.s. we are still</text>
  <text start="222.46" dur="9.59">seeing many peculiar anomalies when it</text>
  <text start="228.91" dur="6.54">has to do with government statistics</text>
  <text start="232.05" dur="6.07">government information and one of them</text>
  <text start="235.45" dur="4.5">is consumer confidence and we talked</text>
  <text start="238.12" dur="4.26">about this before and the new numbers</text>
  <text start="239.95" dur="5.15">are out and we know the conference board</text>
  <text start="242.38" dur="6.21">is basically a tax-exempt nonprofit</text>
  <text start="245.1" dur="7.48">business which is sponsored by the</text>
  <text start="248.59" dur="5.369">government and when you look at it you</text>
  <text start="252.58" dur="5.219">would think that everything is</text>
  <text start="253.959" dur="5.821">absolutely fine in the US they are</text>
  <text start="257.799" dur="3.81">continually saying that consumer</text>
  <text start="259.78" dur="8.61">confidence according to the conference</text>
  <text start="261.609" dur="11.011">board is at all-time highs I mean it is</text>
  <text start="268.39" dur="7.86">way past all other indicators almost</text>
  <text start="272.62" dur="5.52">close to what it was at the height of</text>
  <text start="276.25" dur="5.16">the market right before the crash in</text>
  <text start="278.14" dur="5.97">2008 going into 2009 that&amp;#39;s where they</text>
  <text start="281.41" dur="5.94">pushed it too but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="284.11" dur="8.07">interesting gallop just released its</text>
  <text start="287.35" dur="8.189">numbers for September and the way they</text>
  <text start="292.18" dur="6">do this is they call about 14,000</text>
  <text start="295.539" dur="6.931">different adults around the country</text>
  <text start="298.18" dur="8.269">and they ask them questions and the</text>
  <text start="302.47" dur="6.509">Gallup poll is showing the exact</text>
  <text start="306.449" dur="5.97">opposite of what the government is</text>
  <text start="308.979" dur="6.03">showing us which is very interesting and</text>
  <text start="312.419" dur="6.37">we can see at this point in time we know</text>
  <text start="315.009" dur="7.291">that Gallup is very reliable and even</text>
  <text start="318.789" dur="7.231">the owner of Gallup came out and said</text>
  <text start="322.3" dur="6.929">that these unemployment numbers they</text>
  <text start="326.02" dur="5.429">don&amp;#39;t even make sense anymore so I tend</text>
  <text start="329.229" dur="5.011">to go with what the people are thinking</text>
  <text start="331.449" dur="5.94">and what the people are telling Gallup</text>
  <text start="334.24" dur="7.62">and we are seeing that Gallup is saying</text>
  <text start="337.389" dur="8.041">that confidence in the economy averaged</text>
  <text start="341.86" dur="7.61">around negative 14 for September another</text>
  <text start="345.43" dur="6.63">drop from negative 13 in August and</text>
  <text start="349.47" dur="5.46">gallop is reporting that the index has</text>
  <text start="352.06" dur="7.41">declined steadily since the peak of</text>
  <text start="354.93" dur="8.35">January so we have been seeing this come</text>
  <text start="359.47" dur="6.569">down but the US government is telling us</text>
  <text start="363.28" dur="5.58">the complete opposite and it reminds me</text>
  <text start="366.039" dur="4.591">of 2008 it reminds me when the</text>
  <text start="368.86" dur="3.39">government and the central bank the Fed</text>
  <text start="370.63" dur="4.37">was out there telling us that everything</text>
  <text start="372.25" dur="6.479">was fine there is no recession</text>
  <text start="375" dur="6.07">everything&amp;#39;s contained don&amp;#39;t worry look</text>
  <text start="378.729" dur="3.481">the other way and I feel there at this</text>
  <text start="381.07" dur="2.819">point and they&amp;#39;ve been doing it for a</text>
  <text start="382.21" dur="3.9">very long time but now at this point</text>
  <text start="383.889" dur="4.201">they are really pushing it hard to</text>
  <text start="386.11" dur="3.149">convince everyone that everything is</text>
  <text start="388.09" dur="2.63">fine and this is why the high-frequency</text>
  <text start="389.259" dur="3.961">traders in the plunge protection team</text>
  <text start="390.72" dur="5.05">this is why they&amp;#39;re working so hard to</text>
  <text start="393.22" dur="4.28">keep this market up this is all they</text>
  <text start="395.77" dur="4.53">have left they have nothing else left</text>
  <text start="397.5" dur="6.07">because everyone&amp;#39;s looking at the</text>
  <text start="400.3" dur="7.41">statistical numbers of unemployment GDP</text>
  <text start="403.57" dur="5.7">and a lot of people even financial</text>
  <text start="407.71" dur="3.36">people on the corporate media are</text>
  <text start="409.27" dur="4.07">scratching their head saying this</text>
  <text start="411.07" dur="6.05">doesn&amp;#39;t even make sense anymore are</text>
  <text start="413.34" dur="8.71">these numbers even believable and</text>
  <text start="417.12" dur="10.419">they&amp;#39;re not and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="422.05" dur="7.58">labor force we see at this point the US</text>
  <text start="427.539" dur="4.061">government the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="429.63" dur="5.93">really</text>
  <text start="431.6" dur="6.9">the unemployed workforce from the</text>
  <text start="435.56" dur="5.64">negative sounding jobless category to</text>
  <text start="438.5" dur="5.67">the not in labor force this is that what</text>
  <text start="441.2" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re doing and they&amp;#39;re slowly moving</text>
  <text start="444.17" dur="6.15">the people over to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="446.48" dur="5.91">that everything is fine but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="450.32" dur="5.58">interesting about all of this is back</text>
  <text start="452.39" dur="6.59">between the years of 1982 and 2000 the</text>
  <text start="455.9" dur="5.31">population increased by 52 million and</text>
  <text start="458.98" dur="6">the people that were not in the labor</text>
  <text start="461.21" dur="6.84">force between these years was 9 million</text>
  <text start="464.98" dur="6.19">between the years of truth two thousand</text>
  <text start="468.05" dur="7.2">and two thousand fifteen the population</text>
  <text start="471.17" dur="6.36">increased by 40 million and the number</text>
  <text start="475.25" dur="6.41">of people that are not in the labor</text>
  <text start="477.53" dur="8.76">force is twenty five point eight million</text>
  <text start="481.66" dur="8.22">so we have discrepancies here and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="486.29" dur="6.09">seeing that things don&amp;#39;t look good and</text>
  <text start="489.88" dur="4.06">from all that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at we</text>
  <text start="492.38" dur="4.35">can tell that the US government is</text>
  <text start="493.94" dur="5.94">basically lying to us right to our face</text>
  <text start="496.73" dur="5.07">and from everything they&amp;#39;ve been showing</text>
  <text start="499.88" dur="5.07">us at that the unemployment is that 5.1</text>
  <text start="501.8" dur="5.49">percent we are still seeing layoffs huge</text>
  <text start="504.95" dur="5.76">layoffs but they don&amp;#39;t want to count</text>
  <text start="507.29" dur="6.15">them they don&amp;#39;t show up in the claims</text>
  <text start="510.71" dur="4.41">they don&amp;#39;t want that to happen and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="513.44" dur="3.81">very easy for them to manipulate it they</text>
  <text start="515.12" dur="3.84">just don&amp;#39;t count them and for those</text>
  <text start="517.25" dur="3.63">people who are unemployed they just say</text>
  <text start="518.96" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re not looking anymore but we see</text>
  <text start="520.88" dur="4.11">Air France international they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="522.68" dur="6.27">be laying off five thousand or more</text>
  <text start="524.99" dur="7.38">people conocophillips their layoffs are</text>
  <text start="528.95" dur="7.71">beginning patriot coal two thousand plus</text>
  <text start="532.37" dur="7.29">layoffs sunedison fifteen percent of the</text>
  <text start="536.66" dur="8.82">workforce BF n operations north carolina</text>
  <text start="539.66" dur="8.22">facility 250 AMD 500 people and what</text>
  <text start="545.48" dur="5.96">does this say that the layoffs are</text>
  <text start="547.88" dur="5.54">continuing and they were accelerating I</text>
  <text start="551.44" dur="4.81">mean since the beginning of this year</text>
  <text start="553.42" dur="6.34">we&amp;#39;ve had hundreds of thousands of</text>
  <text start="556.25" dur="5.55">people laid off and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="559.76" dur="5.519">that the u.s. got rid of that department</text>
  <text start="561.8" dur="5.329">that counts layoffs back in 2013</text>
  <text start="565.279" dur="4.97">and of course they did that on purpose</text>
  <text start="567.129" dur="7">it&amp;#39;s much easier to say oh we added</text>
  <text start="570.249" dur="5.921">142,000 and they just leave off how many</text>
  <text start="574.129" dur="5.341">people got laid off which was you know</text>
  <text start="576.17" dur="7.349">for 200 300 thousand people so did we</text>
  <text start="579.47" dur="5.82">really add any jobs no we didn&amp;#39;t when we</text>
  <text start="583.519" dur="3.99">talk about real estate we see real</text>
  <text start="585.29" dur="5.13">estate now stolen we see prices now</text>
  <text start="587.509" dur="5.88">coming down and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="590.42" dur="5.099">is that realtytrac came out with some</text>
  <text start="593.389" dur="4.231">information that the number of buyers</text>
  <text start="595.519" dur="6.3">paying cash for us homes since the sort</text>
  <text start="597.62" dur="11.519">of 2014 through May has increased to one</text>
  <text start="601.819" dur="10.56">third of all sales so this goes back all</text>
  <text start="609.139" dur="6.63">the way to 2013 when I reported that the</text>
  <text start="612.379" dur="7.341">mortgage companies the big banks Chase</text>
  <text start="615.769" dur="8.57">Manhattan oh i should say JPMorgan Chase</text>
  <text start="619.72" dur="7">Bank of America Citibank Wells Fargo</text>
  <text start="624.339" dur="4.091">back then they were laying off thousands</text>
  <text start="626.72" dur="3.089">upon thousands of people in the mortgage</text>
  <text start="628.43" dur="2.849">departments because they knew the</text>
  <text start="629.809" dur="5.88">American people would not be taking out</text>
  <text start="631.279" dur="7.591">mortgages this confirms that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="635.689" dur="7.561">been cash sales and this is up twenty</text>
  <text start="638.87" dur="8.089">percent so the biggest increase of</text>
  <text start="643.25" dur="7.139">foreign buyers is the Chinese people</text>
  <text start="646.959" dur="6.391">who&amp;#39;s all cash purchases rose to forty</text>
  <text start="650.389" dur="8.94">six percent over the 17 month period</text>
  <text start="653.35" dur="8.83">that&amp;#39;s quite a bit and we understand at</text>
  <text start="659.329" dur="6.3">this point the cash buyers are starting</text>
  <text start="662.18" dur="6.3">to drop off the American people cannot</text>
  <text start="665.629" dur="5.82">pick up the slack this is how they knew</text>
  <text start="668.48" dur="4.56">that they weren&amp;#39;t going to need all</text>
  <text start="671.449" dur="3.901">these people in the mortgage departments</text>
  <text start="673.04" dur="3.989">because they knew that most Americans</text>
  <text start="675.35" dur="4.679">they can&amp;#39;t afford a house at this point</text>
  <text start="677.029" dur="5.97">a lot of people lost their homes during</text>
  <text start="680.029" dur="6.36">the 2008 crash and they never recovered</text>
  <text start="682.999" dur="4.77">and they&amp;#39;re continually laying off more</text>
  <text start="686.389" dur="5.57">and more people in these mortgage</text>
  <text start="687.769" dur="7.29">departments and if this interest rate</text>
  <text start="691.959" dur="5.37">takes up just a little bit it is going</text>
  <text start="695.059" dur="3.751">to knock out more and more people and</text>
  <text start="697.329" dur="2.801">they will not</text>
  <text start="698.81" dur="3">be able to purchase a home and this is</text>
  <text start="700.13" dur="4.14">why they&amp;#39;re keeping interest rates very</text>
  <text start="701.81" dur="6.66">very low but as we see the mortgage</text>
  <text start="704.27" dur="6.71">applications continually fall now the</text>
  <text start="708.47" dur="5.58">world&amp;#39;s largest sovereign wealth fund is</text>
  <text start="710.98" dur="5.17">being forced to liquidate their assets</text>
  <text start="714.05" dur="5.22">at this time a lot of companies having a</text>
  <text start="716.15" dur="4.68">huge amount of trouble a lot of</text>
  <text start="719.27" dur="4.5">companies buying back their stocks to</text>
  <text start="720.83" dur="6.18">make their whole entire balance sheet</text>
  <text start="723.77" dur="5.28">look much much better than really is lot</text>
  <text start="727.01" dur="4.67">of these companies aren&amp;#39;t really not</text>
  <text start="729.05" dur="5.16">doing well they&amp;#39;re laying off people</text>
  <text start="731.68" dur="4.36">taking that money by buying back their</text>
