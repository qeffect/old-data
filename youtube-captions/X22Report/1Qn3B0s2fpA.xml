  <text start="127.009" dur="7.851">head aniseh Boris Johnson who is heading</text>
  <text start="129.649" dur="8.191">towards a No Deal brexit and the EU and</text>
  <text start="134.86" dur="5.969">those non elected leaders they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="137.84" dur="7.23">worried about this they&amp;#39;re worried that</text>
  <text start="140.829" dur="6.94">this is actually going to happen now</text>
  <text start="145.07" dur="5.87">what do central bankers what do non</text>
  <text start="147.769" dur="7.201">elected leaders do when this happens</text>
  <text start="150.94" dur="10.96">well they put out propaganda they push</text>
  <text start="154.97" dur="9.41">fear they try to invoke blame within the</text>
  <text start="161.9" dur="6.55">government they like to divide</text>
  <text start="164.38" dur="8.01">they like to put people against people</text>
  <text start="168.45" dur="8.53">this is how they succeed and this is</text>
  <text start="172.39" dur="8.73">exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing in the UK now</text>
  <text start="176.98" dur="7.95">they put out a film about how they were</text>
  <text start="181.12" dur="7.61">discussing brexit and how the EU bragged</text>
  <text start="184.93" dur="7.02">on the film about screwing the UK and</text>
  <text start="188.73" dur="6.31">the EU bragged about crushing Teresa may</text>

  <text start="195.04" dur="4.74">admitted Teresa may wanted a customs</text>
  <text start="196.84" dur="7.14">union all along and they went on and on</text>
  <text start="199.78" dur="7.26">and on trying to make it seem like look</text>
  <text start="203.98" dur="6.96">we have you there is no escape you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="207.04" dur="4.97">going to have to do what we want but</text>
  <text start="210.94" dur="4.65">guess what</text>
  <text start="212.01" dur="5.92">the people didn&amp;#39;t vote for the</text>
  <text start="215.59" dur="5.34">referendum to break away from the EU</text>
  <text start="217.93" dur="6.15">because they like the EU because they</text>
  <text start="220.93" dur="6.54">wanted to be a part of the EU they voted</text>
  <text start="224.08" dur="6.93">to separate themselves because they</text>
  <text start="227.47" dur="6.09">don&amp;#39;t want non elected leaders telling</text>
  <text start="231.01" dur="8.1">them what to do and what this video</text>
  <text start="233.56" dur="10.86">shows is that they were conspiring with</text>
  <text start="239.11" dur="8.73">the leaders of the UK it doesn&amp;#39;t help</text>
  <text start="244.42" dur="7.08">their cause actually it&amp;#39;s going to make</text>
  <text start="247.84" dur="7.56">their cause even worse Boris Johnson and</text>
  <text start="251.5" dur="6.81">those individuals that are pushing the</text>
  <text start="255.4" dur="5.25">brexit they&amp;#39;re going to look past this</text>
  <text start="258.31" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;re gonna push harder than ever</text>
  <text start="260.65" dur="8.1">before and guess what they&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="264.97" dur="5.99">be blaming each other they are focused</text>
  <text start="268.75" dur="4.8">on what they want</text>
  <text start="270.96" dur="5.11">just like here in the United States with</text>
  <text start="273.55" dur="5.58">Trump and the Patriots they are focused</text>
  <text start="276.07" dur="6.06">on what they&amp;#39;re doing everything that</text>
  <text start="279.13" dur="6.39">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="282.13" dur="8.25">happening willy-nilly this has been</text>
  <text start="285.52" dur="7.089">planned for a very very long time this</text>
  <text start="290.38" dur="6.139">is strategy</text>
  <text start="292.609" dur="7.51">they knew coming into all of this that</text>
  <text start="296.519" dur="7.44">the central bank their system was</text>
  <text start="300.119" dur="8.13">imploding they knew that the debt level</text>
  <text start="303.959" dur="6.81">was too high they knew eventually they</text>
  <text start="308.249" dur="4.29">were going to crash the system they knew</text>
  <text start="310.769" dur="6.03">eventually this was going to lead to war</text>
  <text start="312.539" dur="6.36">to cover up the entire thing and they</text>
  <text start="316.799" dur="4.37">knew they were going to have to turn</text>
  <text start="318.899" dur="6.39">everything around</text>
  <text start="321.169" dur="6.28">reverse everything the central bank the</text>
  <text start="325.289" dur="4.53">deep state have been doing to this</text>
  <text start="327.449" dur="6.93">economy they were going to have to</text>
  <text start="329.819" dur="7.5">reverse it and what did they do they</text>
  <text start="334.379" dur="6.66">started to draw up a plan</text>
  <text start="337.319" dur="6.99">they created the plan they created the</text>
  <text start="341.039" dur="6.57">strategy they were going to use and then</text>
  <text start="344.309" dur="5.7">they put it in motion and this is what</text>
  <text start="347.609" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now this is not a</text>
  <text start="350.009" dur="7.53">coincidence this is not happening by</text>
  <text start="352.739" dur="7.02">mistake when Trump says hey listen we</text>
  <text start="357.539" dur="4.52">might not make a trade deal with China</text>
  <text start="359.759" dur="6.21">until September</text>
  <text start="362.059" dur="7.24">he doesn&amp;#39;t say these things unless there</text>
  <text start="365.969" dur="6.15">is a reason it&amp;#39;s all part of the</text>
  <text start="369.299" dur="5.67">strategy remember the longer they go</text>
  <text start="372.119" dur="4.1">with China with these tariffs what</text>
  <text start="374.969" dur="7.05">happens</text>
  <text start="376.219" dur="8.92">China self-destructs corporations move</text>
  <text start="382.019" dur="6.54">out of China maybe into other countries</text>
  <text start="385.139" dur="6.81">maybe back here to the United States the</text>
  <text start="388.559" dur="7.5">reason why Trump is continually pushing</text>
  <text start="391.949" dur="9.81">and pushing is because he wants total</text>
  <text start="396.059" dur="7.95">and full control of the negotiations he</text>
  <text start="401.759" dur="5.28">doesn&amp;#39;t want China to have a Gorm</text>
  <text start="404.009" dur="5.25">China is trying to hold out they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="407.039" dur="5.58">hoping that Trump doesn&amp;#39;t get reelected</text>
  <text start="409.259" dur="6.54">and they&amp;#39;re hoping because there are</text>
  <text start="412.619" dur="6.12">certain deep state operatives within</text>
  <text start="415.799" dur="4.11">China they&amp;#39;re hoping that everything</text>
  <text start="418.739" dur="4.92">goes back to the way it was remember</text>
  <text start="419.909" dur="5.461">each and every country is not immune to</text>
  <text start="423.659" dur="5.341">the deep state</text>
  <text start="425.37" dur="7.049">each country has those individuals</text>
  <text start="429" dur="6.75">within the country calling the shots</text>
  <text start="432.419" dur="8.101">putting pressure on certain individuals</text>
  <text start="435.75" dur="6.169">and Trump right now is using this to his</text>
  <text start="440.52" dur="4.59">advantage</text>
  <text start="441.919" dur="4.741">think about the Fed right here in the</text>
  <text start="445.11" dur="5.49">United States</text>
  <text start="446.66" dur="7.18">think about what Trump has done he is</text>
  <text start="450.6" dur="6.45">completely taken control of what the</text>
  <text start="453.84" dur="6.32">Federal Reserve does he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="457.05" dur="6.27">bring the interest rates down to zero if</text>
  <text start="460.16" dur="5.979">eight central bank loaning money out</text>
  <text start="463.32" dur="6.06">without interest attached that just</text>
  <text start="466.139" dur="6.15">unheard of but this is what Trump is</text>
  <text start="469.38" dur="5.3">driving them towards it makes them</text>
  <text start="472.289" dur="5.671">obsolete what do we need them for then</text>
  <text start="474.68" dur="5.35">what else do they provide actually</text>
  <text start="477.96" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;ve never provided anything they</text>
  <text start="480.03" dur="5.009">don&amp;#39;t help the economy and if you need</text>
  <text start="482.16" dur="6.539">proof of this just go back to say 1984</text>
  <text start="485.039" dur="7.111">back then it took $1 of additional debt</text>
  <text start="488.699" dur="7.381">to create an additional $1 of real GDP</text>
  <text start="492.15" dur="7.05">as of the fourth quarter of 2018</text>
  <text start="496.08" dur="8.309">it took three point eight dollars to</text>
  <text start="499.2" dur="8.13">create one dollar of real GDP as of 2013</text>
  <text start="504.389" dur="5.28">it took more than a dollar of public</text>
  <text start="507.33" dur="4.38">debt to create a dollar of GDP if</text>
  <text start="509.669" dur="4.381">interest rates were three percent</text>
  <text start="511.71" dur="4.829">interest on total credit market debt</text>
  <text start="514.05" dur="5.119">would be a whopping two point one six</text>
  <text start="516.539" dur="5.361">trillion per year that is approximately</text>
  <text start="519.169" dur="8.29">eleven point five percent of real GDP</text>
  <text start="521.9" dur="9.7">year in year out is the central bank</text>
  <text start="527.459" dur="8.161">helping the economy know every time the</text>
  <text start="531.6" dur="8.489">government or the people borrow money it</text>
  <text start="535.62" dur="10.35">hurts the economy the debt is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="540.089" dur="9.511">actually choking the economy and the Fed</text>
  <text start="545.97" dur="6.45">they have to continually force more debt</text>
  <text start="549.6" dur="5.97">into the system but the system is</text>
  <text start="552.42" dur="6.29">choking on the debt it can&amp;#39;t accept any</text>
  <text start="555.57" dur="6.6">more now remember</text>
  <text start="558.71" dur="5.79">the central bank the deep state they</text>
  <text start="562.17" dur="4.35">never thought they&amp;#39;d be in this position</text>
  <text start="564.5" dur="4">they thought they were going to have</text>
  <text start="566.52" dur="3.75">their war or whatever that it was gonna</text>
  <text start="568.5" dur="3.72">be all covered up and they were going to</text>
  <text start="570.27" dur="5.88">restart everything once all that was</text>
  <text start="572.22" dur="6.54">over they never thought that they were</text>
  <text start="576.15" dur="9.41">going to be in a position where they</text>
  <text start="578.76" dur="11.9">have no shield no cover story no blocks</text>
  <text start="585.56" dur="10.41">they&amp;#39;re wide open for everyone to see</text>
  <text start="590.66" dur="7.75">they are now trapped by their own debt</text>
  <text start="595.97" dur="3.1">so when you start to put all this</text>
  <text start="598.41" dur="5.49">together</text>
  <text start="599.07" dur="7.71">the central bank they are being</text>
  <text start="603.9" dur="6">controlled by the Patriots they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="606.78" dur="7.23">bringing the rates down to zero they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="609.9" dur="7.44">trapped by their own debt they have no</text>
  <text start="614.01" dur="6.93">place to go everything that they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="617.34" dur="6.98">in the past will be blamed on them this</text>
  <text start="620.94" dur="5.94">is why Trump is continually out there</text>
  <text start="624.32" dur="4.3">contradicting the Fed telling them</text>
  <text start="626.88" dur="3.3">telling the people they have no idea</text>
  <text start="628.62" dur="4.59">what they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="630.18" dur="5.07">benefiting the people this is all on</text>
  <text start="633.21" dur="5.46">purpose now take a look what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="635.25" dur="5.43">in the market yes the market came down a</text>
  <text start="638.67" dur="5.7">little bit it&amp;#39;s not really that big of a</text>
  <text start="640.68" dur="6.3">deal actually it&amp;#39;s on purpose why do I</text>
  <text start="644.37" dur="4.1">say this because Trump is going to use</text>
  <text start="646.98" dur="4.11">this to his advantage</text>
  <text start="648.47" dur="4.06">he&amp;#39;s going to tell the central bank</text>
  <text start="651.09" dur="4.5">listen he&amp;#39;ll probably tweet this out in</text>
  <text start="652.53" dur="5.64">the next week or two listen we need the</text>
  <text start="655.59" dur="5.01">rate cut the stock market wants to take</text>
  <text start="658.17" dur="4.74">off the stock market would do a lot</text>
  <text start="660.6" dur="4.68">better we would have these ups and downs</text>
  <text start="662.91" dur="5.69">and if you would just cut the rates</text>
  <text start="665.28" dur="6">again wholly this thing would take off</text>
  <text start="668.6" dur="7.18">now look what&amp;#39;s happening with gold if</text>
  <text start="671.28" dur="8.25">you notice just a couple weeks ago we</text>
  <text start="675.78" dur="4.23">just crossed the $1400 mark now where</text>
  <text start="679.53" dur="5.31">are we</text>
  <text start="680.01" dur="6.829">well now we&amp;#39;re over 1500 yes it Bob&amp;#39;s up</text>
  <text start="684.84" dur="5.55">and down it&amp;#39;s not that big of a deal</text>
  <text start="686.839" dur="5.681">they&amp;#39;re bringing the gold price up very</text>
  <text start="690.39" dur="8.13">very slowly they don&amp;#39;t want to shock</text>
  <text start="692.52" dur="8.04">everything have we seen paper contracts</text>
  <text start="698.52" dur="5.91">thrown at gold yet to bring it back</text>
  <text start="700.56" dur="6.63">below 1,400 not yet this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="704.43" dur="5.79">watching if we go through a period of</text>
  <text start="707.19" dur="6.87">time and there are no paper contracts</text>
  <text start="710.22" dur="6.6">there&amp;#39;s no manipulation that tells us</text>
  <text start="714.06" dur="6.029">something that tells us that the</text>
  <text start="716.82" dur="7.17">Patriots are completely in control of</text>
  <text start="720.089" dur="7.591">this system I mean if you look in the</text>
  <text start="723.99" dur="8.55">past every time gold tried to move up it</text>
  <text start="727.68" dur="8.099">was slammed down hard right back to</text>
  <text start="732.54" dur="6">where it started from they would have to</text>
  <text start="735.779" dur="6">slam this down back to 1300 at this</text>
  <text start="738.54" dur="5.19">point and we have not seen it this is</text>
  <text start="741.779" dur="6.661">something that we&amp;#39;re watching though if</text>
  <text start="743.73" dur="7.71">gold continually moves up and there is</text>
  <text start="748.44" dur="6.72">no paper contracts thrown at it the</text>
  <text start="751.44" dur="6.66">Patriots now are in control of the</text>
  <text start="755.16" dur="5.75">entire economic system which means</text>
  <text start="758.1" dur="5.609">they&amp;#39;re going to bring the gold price up</text>
  <text start="760.91" dur="5.32">now where is that magical number where</text>
  <text start="763.709" dur="4.981">it needs to be well if you go back in</text>
  <text start="766.23" dur="5.88">time and if you go to the US debt clock</text>
  <text start="768.69" dur="7.5">what does that tell us well if you use</text>
  <text start="772.11" dur="8.24">the calculation from 1913 and this is</text>
  <text start="776.19" dur="8.1">what it&amp;#39;s showing it says that gold</text>
  <text start="780.35" dur="7.9">should be around five thousand nine</text>
  <text start="784.29" dur="6.78">hundred and fifty per ounce if they use</text>
  <text start="788.25" dur="4.83">the same calculation for silver silver</text>
  <text start="791.07" dur="6.12">should be seven hundred and twenty-five</text>
