  <text start="195.849" dur="11.5">Europe and many other areas it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="200.359" dur="11.94">to get worse as time goes on now America</text>
  <text start="207.349" dur="9.23">today is now moving towards a temp</text>
  <text start="212.299" dur="7.951">economy at one point it was a full-time</text>
  <text start="216.579" dur="7.44">workers economy but there are more than</text>
  <text start="220.25" dur="6.51">17 million independent workers today and</text>
  <text start="224.019" dur="7.69">they represent a bigger share of the</text>
  <text start="226.76" dur="6.78">workforce than ever before now federal</text>
  <text start="231.709" dur="3.78">laws they give a lot of protection to</text>
  <text start="233.54" dur="4.08">full-time workers you know getting</text>
  <text start="235.489" dur="3.541">health benefits or get your pension you</text>
  <text start="237.62" dur="4.799">know you have some type of security</text>
  <text start="239.03" dur="5.099">which is eroding away and pretty soon</text>
  <text start="242.419" dur="4.831">will be non-existent but they still have</text>
  <text start="244.129" dur="5.7">some type of security temporary workers</text>
  <text start="247.25" dur="5.76">and contract employees it&amp;#39;s a completely</text>
  <text start="249.829" dur="5.541">different story temp workers they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="253.01" dur="5.43">really get health insurance vacation</text>
  <text start="255.37" dur="5.35">retirement benefits they are simply paid</text>
  <text start="258.44" dur="3.9">for a limit amount of time that they are</text>
  <text start="260.72" dur="5.72">needed and then they are disposed of</text>
  <text start="262.34" dur="7.4">immediately and we see at this point</text>
  <text start="266.44" dur="6.19">that corporation the big corporations</text>
  <text start="269.74" dur="4.299">what they&amp;#39;re doing and this has been</text>
  <text start="272.63" dur="3.3">going on for quite a while but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="274.039" dur="3.66">seeing it accelerate at this point</text>
  <text start="275.93" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re getting rid of the full-time</text>
  <text start="277.699" dur="4.921">workers they&amp;#39;re bringing them back as</text>
  <text start="281" dur="3.24">part-time this way they don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="282.62" dur="2.97">worry about the pensions they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="284.24" dur="3.6">to worry about the health benefits and</text>
  <text start="285.59" dur="6.81">they only have to pay them for a certain</text>
  <text start="287.84" dur="8.34">number of hours and we see right now</text>
  <text start="292.4" dur="5.28">that this entire middle class is being</text>
  <text start="296.18" dur="5.37">destroyed</text>
  <text start="297.68" dur="7.049">the country is becoming a temp country</text>
  <text start="301.55" dur="5.459">and we see many of the major</text>
  <text start="304.729" dur="3.991">corporations like Merck which is one of</text>
  <text start="307.009" dur="4.051">the largest pharmaceutical companies and</text>
  <text start="308.72" dur="5.22">we know they bring in tons and tons of</text>
  <text start="311.06" dur="7.71">money from selling drugs that people</text>
  <text start="313.94" dur="8.069">really don&amp;#39;t need and basically there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="318.77" dur="6.989">cutting costs they sold their</text>
  <text start="322.009" dur="7.251">Philadelphia Factory and fired 400</text>
  <text start="325.759" dur="8.91">employees then they rehired them back as</text>
  <text start="329.26" dur="6.76">independent contractors I mean this is</text>
  <text start="334.669" dur="2.731">what companies are doing and I remember</text>
  <text start="336.02" dur="4.92">a long time ago when I was working for a</text>
  <text start="337.4" dur="5.51">corporation where they were basically</text>
  <text start="340.94" dur="4.14">getting rid of all the employees an</text>
  <text start="342.91" dur="5.44">outsourcing company was coming in and</text>
  <text start="345.08" dur="9.08">the outsourcing company was hiring these</text>
  <text start="348.35" dur="8.249">people at a lower rate and the company</text>
  <text start="354.16" dur="4.78">hired those people back and they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="356.599" dur="4.081">have to worry about benefits they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="358.94" dur="3.3">have to worry about health insurance</text>
  <text start="360.68" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;d have to worry about any of that</text>
  <text start="362.24" dur="7.76">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see this happen</text>
  <text start="365.12" dur="9.419">around the country and it&amp;#39;s accelerating</text>
  <text start="370" dur="7.12">right now middle-class Americans make up</text>
  <text start="374.539" dur="5.85">a minority of the population back in</text>
  <text start="377.12" dur="6.539">1971 sixty-one percent of all Americans</text>
  <text start="380.389" dur="5.881">lived in middle-class households Pew</text>
  <text start="383.659" dur="4.201">Research Center has also found that</text>
  <text start="386.27" dur="4.079">median wealth for middle-class</text>
  <text start="387.86" dur="6.9">households dropped by an astounding 28</text>
  <text start="390.349" dur="7.081">percent between 2001 and 2013 there are</text>
  <text start="394.76" dur="5.159">still nine hundred thousand fewer</text>
  <text start="397.43" dur="7.14">middle-class jobs in America than there</text>
  <text start="399.919" dur="6.03">were when the last recession began the</text>
  <text start="404.57" dur="3.06">Social Security Administration is</text>
  <text start="405.949" dur="4.741">reporting that 51 percent of all</text>
  <text start="407.63" dur="6.69">Americans make less than 30,000 a year</text>
  <text start="410.69" dur="7.07">an astounding forty eight point eight</text>
  <text start="414.32" dur="6.33">percent of all 25 year old Americans</text>
  <text start="417.76" dur="6.339">they still live at home with their</text>
  <text start="420.65" dur="5.79">parents these young adults coming out of</text>
  <text start="424.099" dur="4.801">college coming out of high school they</text>
  <text start="426.44" dur="4.68">cannot find the high-paying jobs</text>
  <text start="428.9" dur="4.44">especially those who have gone to</text>
  <text start="431.12" dur="4.68">they cannot make the payments on their</text>
  <text start="433.34" dur="4.56">student loans this is why the government</text>
  <text start="435.8" dur="5.58">stepped in and said ok we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll base</text>
  <text start="437.9" dur="4.47">your payments on your income think about</text>
  <text start="441.38" dur="4.2">that for a second</text>
  <text start="442.37" dur="6.21">the US Census Bureau says forty nine</text>
  <text start="445.58" dur="6">percent of all Americans now live in a</text>
  <text start="448.58" dur="5.52">in a home that receives money from the</text>
  <text start="451.58" dur="4.95">government each month 47 million</text>
  <text start="454.1" dur="6.08">Americans are living in poverty right</text>
  <text start="456.53" dur="6.12">now and this is getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="460.18" dur="6.13">not getting better because when we go</text>
  <text start="462.65" dur="5.15">back in time moving forward we see no</text>
  <text start="466.31" dur="4.95">improvement whatsoever</text>
  <text start="467.8" dur="6.81">now something big just happening the</text>
  <text start="471.26" dur="6.42">Chicago PMI came out with their</text>
  <text start="474.61" dur="9.04">information Chicago&amp;#39;s business barometer</text>
  <text start="477.68" dur="9.84">and it collapsed and we haven&amp;#39;t seen</text>
  <text start="483.65" dur="9.47">these levels since the last recession</text>
  <text start="487.52" dur="10.85">and the last time we saw levels this low</text>
  <text start="493.12" dur="7.12">America never avoided a recession and</text>
  <text start="498.37" dur="3.25">I&amp;#39;m not even going to call it a</text>
  <text start="500.24" dur="5.67">recession because when this thing goes</text>
  <text start="501.62" dur="5.7">it&amp;#39;s going to be a collapse it came in</text>
  <text start="505.91" dur="5.03">at forty two point nine it missed</text>
  <text start="507.32" dur="6.3">expectations of 50 this is the most ever</text>
  <text start="510.94" dur="7.539">down from forty eight point seven in</text>
  <text start="513.62" dur="7.94">November so what are we seeing we are</text>
  <text start="518.479" dur="5.941">seeing that this economy right now is</text>
  <text start="521.56" dur="6.219">headed towards a complete and utter</text>

  <text start="530.48" dur="6.72">four hundred and seventy seven points</text>
  <text start="532.07" dur="8.01">and as time goes on it&amp;#39;s getting worse</text>
  <text start="537.2" dur="5.1">now everyone is trying to make it seem</text>
  <text start="540.08" dur="4.11">and I&amp;#39;m saying the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="542.3" dur="4.32">US government central bankers that this</text>
  <text start="544.19" dur="4.92">holiday season was fantastic but what</text>
  <text start="546.62" dur="4.23">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense if retail sales were</text>
  <text start="549.11" dur="3.39">so great and they just couldn&amp;#39;t keep up</text>
  <text start="550.85" dur="3.72">with everything and they were selling</text>
  <text start="552.5" dur="3.77">everything that they had and it beat all</text>
  <text start="554.57" dur="7.1">expectations</text>
  <text start="556.27" dur="7.72">why did trucking just fall off the cliff</text>
  <text start="561.67" dur="4.87">the numbers for</text>

  <text start="775.31" dur="5.01">Truman where they were using propaganda</text>
  <text start="777.59" dur="3.99">that Iran was firing a missile at them</text>
  <text start="780.32" dur="4.92">or it was very close to them about</text>
  <text start="781.58" dur="5.76">fifteen hundred yards toran right now is</text>
  <text start="785.24" dur="5.22">completely denying that they were firing</text>
  <text start="787.34" dur="5.58">any rockets near the USS Harry s Truman</text>
  <text start="790.46" dur="5.07">they said they&amp;#39;ve put warnings out there</text>
  <text start="792.92" dur="4.43">and basically they&amp;#39;re saying this is an</text>
  <text start="795.53" dur="4.32">act of psychological warfare</text>
  <text start="797.35" dur="4.78">psychological warfare and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="799.85" dur="5.76">absolutely right this was done on</text>
  <text start="802.13" dur="8.22">purpose and they&amp;#39;re blowing it out of</text>
  <text start="805.61" dur="9.72">proportion to do certain things and we</text>
  <text start="810.35" dur="6.18">might see their new narrative and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="815.33" dur="3.81">starting to look like their new</text>
  <text start="816.53" dur="5.85">narrative is to go directly to the prize</text>
  <text start="819.14" dur="4.83">and that&amp;#39;s Iran even though they came up</text>
  <text start="822.38" dur="4.95">with the p5 plus one peace talks on</text>
  <text start="823.97" dur="4.95">nuclear power and nuclear weapons that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="827.33" dur="3.99">meaningless because that&amp;#39;s not what it</text>
  <text start="828.92" dur="3.75">was about it was about</text>
  <text start="831.32" dur="3.51">placing the dollar on their oil</text>
  <text start="832.67" dur="2.7">implementing a central bank in their</text>
  <text start="834.83" dur="2.22">country</text>
  <text start="835.37" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;s why Kerry says if this peace deal</text>
  <text start="837.05" dur="4.35">doesn&amp;#39;t work out the dollars going to</text>
  <text start="840.11" dur="3.39">collapse and he wasn&amp;#39;t talking about the</text>
  <text start="841.4" dur="4.11">nuclear end of it he was talking about</text>
  <text start="843.5" dur="4.77">how the US was going to get into Iran</text>
  <text start="845.51" dur="5.79">and place the central bank in there and</text>
  <text start="848.27" dur="6.36">the dollar and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="851.3" dur="5.7">that Iran is making deals with Russia</text>
  <text start="854.63" dur="5.75">bypassing the dollar and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="857" dur="5.33">starting to realize that this deal is</text>
  <text start="860.38" dur="5.88">not going to work</text>
  <text start="862.33" dur="8.14">Iran is not going to do what they want</text>
  <text start="866.26" dur="5.68">so what are they going to do well it</text>
  <text start="870.47" dur="4.17">looks like they&amp;#39;re getting prepared and</text>
  <text start="871.94" dur="6.05">ready to provoke a ram now it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="874.64" dur="6.09">interesting in The Wall Street Journal I</text>
  <text start="877.99" dur="3.28">mean the following sentence doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="880.73" dur="3.15">make sense</text>
  <text start="881.27" dur="5.04">the Obama administration is preparing to</text>
  <text start="883.88" dur="5.43">impose its first financial sanctions on</text>
  <text start="886.31" dur="6.6">Iran since it forged a landmark nuclear</text>
  <text start="889.31" dur="7.2">agreement in July well the whole purpose</text>
  <text start="892.91" dur="8.19">of the landmark nuclear agreement was to</text>
  <text start="896.51" dur="8.43">remove the sanctions and they the</text>
  <text start="901.1" dur="7.19">countries came to an agreement so why</text>
  <text start="904.94" dur="5.85">are they placing more sanctions on Iran</text>
  <text start="908.29" dur="5.83">because it had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="910.79" dur="6.42">nuclear we knew eventually they were</text>
  <text start="914.12" dur="6.44">going to go into Syria basically put in</text>
  <text start="917.21" dur="6.84">a puppet government build a pipeline</text>
  <text start="920.56" dur="6.52">into Europe through Syria put the dollar</text>
  <text start="924.05" dur="5.1">on Syria&amp;#39;s oil and then eventually go</text>
  <text start="927.08" dur="7.71">into Iran and it looks like at this</text>
  <text start="929.15" dur="9.48">point they are pushing towards going for</text>
  <text start="934.79" dur="7.64">the prize and that is Iran because their</text>
  <text start="938.63" dur="6.21">backs are against the wall what other</text>
  <text start="942.43" dur="5.38">alternative do they have at this point</text>
  <text start="944.84" dur="4.47">the dollar is collapsing the economy the</text>
  <text start="947.81" dur="6.12">private western central bank economies</text>
  <text start="949.31" dur="7.65">are collapsing Russia is in Syria they</text>
  <text start="953.93" dur="6.66">know there&amp;#39;s no way to beat Russia they</text>
  <text start="956.96" dur="5.97">can&amp;#39;t get Assad this UN Security peace</text>
  <text start="960.59" dur="4.26">deal that they&amp;#39;re putting together will</text>
  <text start="962.93" dur="2.43">not work because the people will vote</text>
  <text start="964.85" dur="3.21">for a</text>
  <text start="965.36" dur="5.58">Sode and this will not help the United</text>
  <text start="968.06" dur="6.45">States so the war mongers are thinking</text>
  <text start="970.94" dur="5.49">up a new plan and it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="974.51" dur="6.3">evolve and we&amp;#39;ll see it continually</text>
  <text start="976.43" dur="6">evolve into 2016 so the u.s. is going to</text>
  <text start="980.81" dur="3.99">place sanctions on 12 different</text>
  <text start="982.43" dur="4.649">companies in Iran over this ballistic</text>
  <text start="984.8" dur="4.979">missile program but Iran is saying</text>
  <text start="987.079" dur="4.38">listen we have every right to defend</text>
  <text start="989.779" dur="4.201">ourselves wait is that what the United</text>
  <text start="991.459" dur="4.531">States always says absolutely we are</text>
  <text start="993.98" dur="4.289">creating these missiles and these</text>
  <text start="995.99" dur="5.7">missiles that were designing they do not</text>
  <text start="998.269" dur="6.801">carry nuclear weapons so all of what the</text>
  <text start="1001.69" dur="8.91">United States is doing is basically</text>
  <text start="1005.07" dur="8.92">provoking us that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1010.6" dur="6.299">at this point so they&amp;#39;re provoking Iran</text>
  <text start="1013.99" dur="6">they play sanctions on companies in</text>
  <text start="1016.899" dur="7.591">North Korea that are working with Iran</text>
  <text start="1019.99" dur="7.699">and they&amp;#39;re bringing all the players</text>
  <text start="1024.49" dur="9.36">together now North Korea Iran Syria</text>
  <text start="1027.689" dur="10.24">Russia China all together for this next</text>
  <text start="1033.85" dur="6.989">war now Obama is considering bringing in</text>
  <text start="1037.929" dur="4.681">ground troops into Libya well he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1040.839" dur="6.21">gonna calm ground troops they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1042.61" dur="6.569">to be advisers special teams which means</text>
  <text start="1047.049" dur="4.351">ground troops because that&amp;#39;s what it</text>
  <text start="1049.179" dur="7.171">really means so they&amp;#39;re planning on</text>
  <text start="1051.4" dur="7.11">bombing runs France Italy Egypt United</text>
  <text start="1056.35" dur="4.92">States England and now we see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1058.51" dur="6.659">planning on bringing in advisers to help</text>
  <text start="1061.27" dur="6.06">to help the new unified government it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1065.169" dur="6.571">isn&amp;#39;t this the same thing they did in</text>
  <text start="1067.33" dur="6.599">Iraq isn&amp;#39;t this what they told everyone</text>
  <text start="1071.74" dur="4.38">and they&amp;#39;re continually bringing in more</text>
  <text start="1073.929" dur="4.201">and more troops and they are in combat</text>
  <text start="1076.12" dur="4.98">and the reason why they&amp;#39;re bringing</text>
  <text start="1078.13" dur="5.789">troops into Libya or going to bring in</text>
  <text start="1081.1" dur="6.06">troops into Libya is to remove that</text>
  <text start="1083.919" dur="4.771">elected government in Tripoli do we know</text>
  <text start="1087.16" dur="5.99">they&amp;#39;re not going after the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1088.69" dur="9.36">state whatsoever now there is a petition</text>
  <text start="1093.15" dur="9.55">on White House petition</text>
  <text start="1098.05" dur="10.31">website and there&amp;#39;s about 35,000 members</text>
  <text start="1102.7" dur="8.73">of the American population who is saying</text>
  <text start="1108.36" dur="8.32">they need the president needs to declare</text>
  <text start="1111.43" dur="9.12">her won and Turkey as state sponsors of</text>
  <text start="1116.68" dur="6.72">terror and I&amp;#39;m amazed that it&amp;#39;s up to</text>
  <text start="1120.55" dur="7.08">35,000 because most people have no clue</text>
  <text start="1123.4" dur="7.92">what&amp;#39;s going on because the petition</text>
  <text start="1127.63" dur="7.29">says it is undeniable that Iran supports</text>
  <text start="1131.32" dur="5.82">jihad terrorism in Syria the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1134.92" dur="4.26">state exports oil via turkey and</text>
  <text start="1137.14" dur="4.35">terrorists of Islamic state al Qaeda and</text>
  <text start="1139.18" dur="8.58">other jihad groups transit the border</text>
  <text start="1141.49" dur="8.61">and Turkey controls all of it I&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="1147.76" dur="4.23">to watch the petition to see how far</text>
  <text start="1150.1" dur="2.91">this gets but right now I believe it</text>
  <text start="1151.99" dur="3.57">needs about a hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="1153.01" dur="5.58">signatures to get where it where it</text>
  <text start="1155.56" dur="4.38">needs to go and I think it needs to get</text>
  <text start="1158.59" dur="4.68">there by January first and I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="1159.94" dur="7.23">it&amp;#39;s going to meet it now we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1163.27" dur="7.44">a couple of false flags right now Paris</text>
  <text start="1167.17" dur="8.07">right now is nervous about additional</text>
  <text start="1170.71" dur="7.11">attacks and they are canceling New</text>
  <text start="1175.24" dur="4.26">Year&amp;#39;s fireworks so far many of the</text>
  <text start="1177.82" dur="3.96">countries are canceling the fireworks</text>
  <text start="1179.5" dur="5.19">display instead they&amp;#39;re going to show a</text>
  <text start="1181.78" dur="6.3">video show so they&amp;#39;re keeping the fear</text>
  <text start="1184.69" dur="6.63">factor alive we&amp;#39;re letting the false</text>
  <text start="1188.08" dur="6.33">Flags control our lives and the</text>
  <text start="1191.32" dur="5.01">government&amp;#39;s control our lives to keep</text>
  <text start="1194.41" dur="2.73">us in fear to say you don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="1196.33" dur="3.06">fireworks</text>
  <text start="1197.14" dur="5.36">you don&amp;#39;t need alcohol there will be</text>
  <text start="1199.39" dur="5.81">curfews but enjoy your new year and</text>
  <text start="1202.5" dur="6.88">right now on the ground in Paris there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1205.2" dur="7.24">11,000 soldiers which include police and</text>
  <text start="1209.38" dur="7.05">emergency workers 2,000 more than last</text>
  <text start="1212.44" dur="7.61">year and right now they are not even</text>
  <text start="1216.43" dur="7.17">allowed to sell and use fireworks and</text>
  <text start="1220.05" dur="7.81">they can&amp;#39;t have alcohol drinks or any</text>
  <text start="1223.6" dur="6.44">drinks in glass bottles and we can see</text>
  <text start="1227.86" dur="4.11">at this point many of the countries</text>
  <text start="1230.04" dur="4.81">they&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="1231.97" dur="4.5">fear into the people the United States</text>
  <text start="1234.85" dur="2.91">has warnings all over the place that</text>
  <text start="1236.47" dur="2.94">there could be attacked during the years</text>
  <text start="1237.76" dur="4.98">day they told us about New Year</text>
  <text start="1239.41" dur="6.09">Christmas Eve and personally I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1242.74" dur="5.49">think there will be an attack New Year&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1245.5" dur="6.47">Day New Year&amp;#39;s Eve or any of the times</text>
  <text start="1248.23" dur="6.51">they tell us one the crowds are too big</text>
  <text start="1251.97" dur="5.53">they they will not be able to control</text>
  <text start="1254.74" dur="5.52">their false flag there&amp;#39;s too many people</text>
  <text start="1257.5" dur="4.77">with cameras there&amp;#39;s too much going on</text>
  <text start="1260.26" dur="4.17">and you have to remember when you look</text>
  <text start="1262.27" dur="6.03">at these false flag events it normally</text>
  <text start="1264.43" dur="8.61">takes place in a small area where it can</text>
  <text start="1268.3" dur="6.59">be controlled and they allow coverage</text>
  <text start="1273.04" dur="5.58">and usually it takes place inside</text>
  <text start="1274.89" dur="6.7">buildings because outside there&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="1278.62" dur="5.79">many cameras too many people too many</text>
  <text start="1281.59" dur="5.25">anomalies that can go wrong and this is</text>
  <text start="1284.41" dur="4.32">why I don&amp;#39;t think anything will happen</text>
  <text start="1286.84" dur="4.08">now of course I can be completely wrong</text>
  <text start="1288.73" dur="6.27">but at this point from their track</text>
  <text start="1290.92" dur="5.49">record this is what I&amp;#39;m seeing now does</text>
  <text start="1295" dur="7.08">that mean we&amp;#39;re not gonna see any false</text>
  <text start="1296.41" dur="8.67">flags no most likely come 2016 we will</text>
  <text start="1302.08" dur="5.76">see other events occur especially for</text>
  <text start="1305.08" dur="4.83">the gun control especially to bring us</text>
  <text start="1307.84" dur="3.6">to war because we know the economy is</text>
  <text start="1309.91" dur="3.39">failing they have to get the</text>
  <text start="1311.44" dur="3.69">authorization for war passed in Congress</text>
  <text start="1313.3" dur="4.47">so they can bring in the troops and</text>
  <text start="1315.13" dur="5.22">really kick off this war so they will</text>
  <text start="1317.77" dur="5.73">have a controlled area it will be done</text>
  <text start="1320.35" dur="7.11">inside so no-one can see what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1323.5" dur="5.97">it will be blamed on the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1327.46" dur="5.31">or whatever group they want to blame it</text>
