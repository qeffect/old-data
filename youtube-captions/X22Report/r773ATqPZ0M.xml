  <text start="148.61" dur="4.47">that will fall right back on them Trump</text>
  <text start="152.12" dur="2.729">would just turn this whole thing around</text>
  <text start="153.08" dur="3.659">and say well I&amp;#39;m using the same</text>
  <text start="154.849" dur="3.601">calculations that you&amp;#39;ve been using that</text>

  <text start="163.38" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;s why they can&amp;#39;t use this this is</text>
  <text start="166.08" dur="4.65">why they&amp;#39;re going down a different route</text>
  <text start="168.12" dur="5.1">and the route is trying to make everyone</text>
  <text start="170.73" dur="5.22">believe that this recession is coming</text>
  <text start="173.22" dur="5.88">now don&amp;#39;t get me wrong we know that</text>
  <text start="175.95" dur="5.31">these numbers are completely off they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="179.1" dur="3.72">manipulated they have been for a very</text>
  <text start="181.26" dur="5.64">long time from with the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="182.82" dur="8.07">know this but to win the next election</text>
  <text start="186.9" dur="7.47">to get the people support what do you</text>
  <text start="190.89" dur="6.78">have to do you have to make sure that</text>
  <text start="194.37" dur="7.5">everyone understands that the economy is</text>
  <text start="197.67" dur="6.03">ten times better than it was that those</text>
  <text start="201.87" dur="3.9">people who couldn&amp;#39;t find jobs I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="203.7" dur="5.36">talking about the low paying jobs</text>
  <text start="205.77" dur="9.06">minorities and the rest they have found</text>
  <text start="209.06" dur="9.43">jobs and they&amp;#39;re making a living and the</text>
  <text start="214.83" dur="5.37">mainstream media what can they do the</text>
  <text start="218.49" dur="3.57">only thing they can do is have different</text>
  <text start="220.2" dur="4.74">financial pundits on their on their</text>
  <text start="222.06" dur="5.49">networks and say hey we have a problem</text>
  <text start="224.94" dur="4.44">in the economy recession is coming now</text>
  <text start="227.55" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re pushing many different stories</text>
  <text start="229.38" dur="6.54">and this reminds me of the story with</text>
  <text start="232.05" dur="6.12">Syria and Turkey and the Kurds where</text>
  <text start="235.92" dur="5.22">they put up a fake video and they said</text>
  <text start="238.17" dur="6.12">oh this is the Kurds being hit by turkey</text>
  <text start="241.14" dur="5.7">and we find out that it&amp;#39;s fake and when</text>
  <text start="244.29" dur="4.74">you look at some of these headlines you</text>
  <text start="246.84" dur="5.16">can see the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="249.03" dur="5.13">misleading the public on retail sales</text>
  <text start="252" dur="4.5">now I&amp;#39;m not saying retail sales are</text>
  <text start="254.16" dur="4.56">fantastic if you look at retail sales</text>
  <text start="256.5" dur="4.23">they really haven&amp;#39;t gone anywhere and</text>
  <text start="258.72" dur="5.34">stores are having a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="260.73" dur="5.97">surviving but what they have done is</text>
  <text start="264.06" dur="6.87">they picked out a specific time frame</text>
  <text start="266.7" dur="7.5">and they tried to create this narrative</text>
  <text start="270.93" dur="5.22">around this little tiny time frame to</text>
  <text start="274.2" dur="4.5">let everyone know that what Trump is</text>
  <text start="276.15" dur="3.8">doing it&amp;#39;s not working this is coming</text>
  <text start="278.7" dur="4.8">out of Barron&amp;#39;s this is the headline</text>
  <text start="279.95" dur="6.31">retail sales fell in September is it</text>
  <text start="283.5" dur="5.52">time to worry about the US consumer The</text>
  <text start="286.26" dur="5.79">Wall Street Journal US retail sales fell</text>
  <text start="289.02" dur="6.12">in September America shoppers pullback</text>
  <text start="292.05" dur="4.709">on spending in September signaling a key</text>
  <text start="295.14" dur="3.419">support for the US economy</text>
  <text start="296.759" dur="4.291">this year could be softening amid a</text>
  <text start="298.559" dur="4.47">broader global economic slowdown of</text>
  <text start="301.05" dur="4.709">course they got the global economic</text>
  <text start="303.029" dur="5.7">slowdown from the IMF and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="305.759" dur="6">that consumers are pulling back and then</text>
  <text start="308.729" dur="5.041">we have Bloomberg and it says this is a</text>
  <text start="311.759" dur="4.74">masterpiece about the suddenly shaky</text>
  <text start="313.77" dur="7.859">consumer retail sales unexpectedly drop</text>
  <text start="316.499" dur="9.69">in sign consumers are shaky now when you</text>
  <text start="321.629" dur="9.06">look at the retail numbers we need to</text>
  <text start="326.189" dur="6.48">understand what is happening here so if</text>
  <text start="330.689" dur="5.88">you look at total retail and food</text>
  <text start="332.669" dur="5.73">services restaurants cafes etc retail</text>
  <text start="336.569" dur="4.5">sales world rose by four point one</text>
  <text start="338.399" dur="5.64">percent retail sales without food</text>
  <text start="341.069" dur="6.301">services row by rose by four point zero</text>

  <text start="354.449" dur="5.31">motor vehicle parts sales rose by four</text>
  <text start="357.36" dur="4.769">point five percent so a four percent</text>
  <text start="359.759" dur="5.88">year-over-year increase in retail sales</text>
  <text start="362.129" dur="8.28">is pretty strong and about in line what</text>
  <text start="365.639" dur="6.81">you expect from the figures but what the</text>
  <text start="370.409" dur="6.51">mean what the mainstream media has done</text>
  <text start="372.449" dur="8.101">is they&amp;#39;ve taken the September sales</text>
  <text start="376.919" dur="7.77">numbers and they&amp;#39;re focusing on a</text>
  <text start="380.55" dur="4.849">month-to-month sales number now what</text>
  <text start="384.689" dur="4.46">happens</text>
  <text start="385.399" dur="8.41">seasonally what happens at certain times</text>
  <text start="389.149" dur="7.08">well things change and it&amp;#39;s a pattern</text>
  <text start="393.809" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s not like this is a one-off thing in</text>
  <text start="396.229" dur="6.96">August when everyone is going back to</text>
  <text start="399.059" dur="7.681">school August sales are quite strong</text>
  <text start="403.189" dur="7.69">then what happens they drop off in</text>
  <text start="406.74" dur="8.88">September yes this is their pattern if</text>
  <text start="410.879" dur="8.9">you look at 2018 you look at 20 17 16 15</text>
  <text start="415.62" dur="6.75">14 you can see the pattern strong sales</text>
  <text start="419.779" dur="5.021">drop-off it&amp;#39;s almost like the holiday</text>
  <text start="422.37" dur="4.889">season where during the Obama</text>
  <text start="424.8" dur="4.139">administration they said oh look</text>
  <text start="427.259" dur="2.91">everyone&amp;#39;s getting a job no these were</text>
  <text start="428.939" dur="3.241">all part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="430.169" dur="4.05">the holiday season then they would come</text>
  <text start="432.18" dur="4.769">out and say oh look retail sales are</text>
  <text start="434.219" dur="5.341">booming well no these are holiday sales</text>
  <text start="436.949" dur="4.62">and then what would happen right after</text>
  <text start="439.56" dur="5.939">holiday sales all those part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="441.569" dur="6.12">would disappear and guess what the sales</text>
  <text start="445.499" dur="4.621">would drop we&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing</text>
  <text start="447.689" dur="5.491">but they only cherry picked this small</text>
  <text start="450.12" dur="7.049">little area to say oh look the consumers</text>
  <text start="453.18" dur="6.599">are shaky right now again more people</text>
  <text start="457.169" dur="2.881">believe and this is a really big part of</text>
  <text start="459.779" dur="3.51">it</text>
  <text start="460.05" dur="6.209">if people believe that the economy is</text>
  <text start="463.289" dur="5.94">doing well they spend more if they see</text>
  <text start="466.259" dur="6.15">their homes going up in appreciation</text>
  <text start="469.229" dur="5.75">which is only on paper they feel good</text>
  <text start="472.409" dur="5.88">and they go out and they spend money</text>
  <text start="474.979" dur="7.93">Trump has made everyone feel fantastic</text>
  <text start="478.289" dur="7.59">and people they are spending credit card</text>
  <text start="482.909" dur="7.44">spending is up they feel like things are</text>
  <text start="485.879" dur="6.241">turning around and once again Trump is</text>
  <text start="490.349" dur="4.981">using this to control the economic</text>
  <text start="492.12" dur="5.909">narrative optics are very important he</text>
  <text start="495.33" dur="5.399">needs to be reelected in 2020 how do you</text>
  <text start="498.029" dur="5.431">do this you control the economy now</text>

  <text start="700.67" dur="5.22">most likely they will start off using</text>
  <text start="703.67" dur="3.78">gold to back it to give everyone</text>
  <text start="705.89" dur="3.75">confidence why do you think the central</text>
  <text start="707.45" dur="4.47">banks have been ramping up on gold</text>
  <text start="709.64" dur="3.87">purchases because they know their</text>
  <text start="711.92" dur="4.02">systems falling apart and when it falls</text>
  <text start="713.51" dur="5.13">apart they ramp up on gold purchases and</text>
  <text start="715.94" dur="4.35">then when the reset comes they put the</text>
  <text start="718.64" dur="4.05">entire system back on goal to build</text>
  <text start="720.29" dur="5.07">confidence and what happens is slowly</text>
  <text start="722.69" dur="6.57">over time they remove this system off</text>
  <text start="725.36" dur="6.99">gold Trump and the Patriots they have a</text>
  <text start="729.26" dur="4.53">different plan and again when I say</text>
  <text start="732.35" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re gonna put it on gold it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="733.79" dur="4.32">be linked to maybe an SDR or something</text>
  <text start="735.83" dur="4.77">like that but the Patriots have a</text>
  <text start="738.11" dur="4.74">completely different plan and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="740.6" dur="3.66">the central bank plan it has nothing to</text>
  <text start="742.85" dur="3.93">do with a private western central bank</text>
  <text start="744.26" dur="3.9">it has to do with the people creating</text>
  <text start="746.78" dur="6.81">their own currency with no interest</text>
  <text start="748.16" dur="8.73">attached where the currency is backed by</text>
  <text start="753.59" dur="4.44">sound money by gold or something don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="756.89" dur="5.43">know exactly what it is</text>
  <text start="758.03" dur="6.87">I assume gold something that is stable</text>
  <text start="762.32" dur="6.15">that has been stable for thousands upon</text>
  <text start="764.9" dur="6.69">thousands of years and this will not</text>
  <text start="768.47" dur="5.34">include the central bank actually the</text>
  <text start="771.59" dur="4.62">Patriots are going to expose the central</text>
  <text start="773.81" dur="5.18">bank they&amp;#39;re going to show the people</text>
  <text start="776.21" dur="6.87">that these private western central banks</text>
  <text start="778.99" dur="5.95">they are the cause of the problem here</text>
  <text start="783.08" dur="6.48">in the United States and around the</text>
  <text start="784.94" dur="7.5">world and we should never again let this</text>
  <text start="789.56" dur="8.28">happen where we give the creation of</text>
  <text start="792.44" dur="8.31">currency to a private corporation that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="797.84" dur="5.7">where the Patriots are headed and guess</text>
