  <text start="87.85" dur="9">about these issues they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="91.83" dur="7.66">the issues with regards to what the</text>
  <text start="96.85" dur="5.4">government has put out there and what I</text>
  <text start="99.49" dur="5.58">mean by that is the government puts out</text>
  <text start="102.25" dur="6.21">certain propaganda where it&amp;#39;s their</text>
  <text start="105.07" dur="5.85">version of the truth Obamacare is great</text>
  <text start="108.46" dur="5.46">it&amp;#39;s helping the people there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="110.92" dur="7.649">wrong with it it&amp;#39;s not a disaster it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="113.92" dur="7.17">fine but we know that Obamacare is a</text>
  <text start="118.569" dur="6.421">complete disaster not just by saying it</text>
  <text start="121.09" dur="6.96">by understanding that more than half of</text>
  <text start="124.99" dur="5.43">the exchanges have gone bankrupt the</text>
  <text start="128.05" dur="4.47">insurance companies have decided you</text>
  <text start="130.42" dur="4.11">know what we can&amp;#39;t make any money doing</text>
  <text start="132.52" dur="5.25">this and it&amp;#39;s funny because they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="134.53" dur="6.03">ones who wrote the bill people are</text>
  <text start="137.77" dur="6">looking at Obamacare saying okay why do</text>
  <text start="140.56" dur="7.02">I have a penalty and why are you forcing</text>
  <text start="143.77" dur="6.18">me to take health insurance Obama told</text>
  <text start="147.58" dur="4.14">us that Obamacare was going to be</text>
  <text start="149.95" dur="4.32">affordable that&amp;#39;s why it was named the</text>
  <text start="151.72" dur="4.71">Affordable Care Act of course as we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="154.27" dur="4.469">always said whatever they named the bill</text>
  <text start="156.43" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s always the opposite premiums are</text>
  <text start="158.739" dur="4.951">skyrocketing people cannot afford it so</text>
  <text start="161.98" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re dropping it they&amp;#39;d rather take</text>
  <text start="163.69" dur="5.37">the penalty which is completely</text>
  <text start="165.37" dur="7.38">unconstitutional first of all now Obama</text>
  <text start="169.06" dur="7.25">is out there and he&amp;#39;s going to tell you</text>
  <text start="172.75" dur="6.45">how he&amp;#39;s going to a how is going to fix</text>
  <text start="176.31" dur="3.79">Obamacare so wait let me get this</text>
  <text start="179.2" dur="4.32">straight</text>
  <text start="180.1" dur="6.03">he created Obamacare telling us how</text>
  <text start="183.52" dur="5.34">great it&amp;#39;s going to be how we can keep</text>
  <text start="186.13" dur="4.17">our doctors how the insurance premiums</text>
  <text start="188.86" dur="3.06">are going to be very low everyone can</text>
  <text start="190.3" dur="4.44">afford it it&amp;#39;s going to be health</text>
  <text start="191.92" dur="7.02">insurance for everyone and the opposite</text>
  <text start="194.74" dur="7.41">happened and now he&amp;#39;s telling us that he</text>
  <text start="198.94" dur="5.88">can fix Obamacare the thing that he</text>
  <text start="202.15" dur="5.64">created which he really didn&amp;#39;t create it</text>
  <text start="204.82" dur="6.75">was the health insurance industry so</text>
  <text start="207.79" dur="8.37">he&amp;#39;s urging young people to go sign up</text>
  <text start="211.57" dur="6.9">to Obamacare because the government will</text>
  <text start="216.16" dur="7.26">subsidize you and you won&amp;#39;t have to pay</text>
  <text start="218.47" dur="8.01">anything and he&amp;#39;s also suggesting that</text>
  <text start="223.42" dur="6.41">lawmakers create a government-run health</text>
  <text start="226.48" dur="6.12">insurance option very interesting</text>
  <text start="229.83" dur="7.36">because this seems to be what they were</text>
  <text start="232.6" dur="6.51">after all along and whenever the</text>
  <text start="237.19" dur="6.51">government gets involved in anything it</text>
  <text start="239.11" dur="9.12">is always a disaster so what they want</text>
  <text start="243.7" dur="8.61">to do is they want to fix the problem</text>
  <text start="248.23" dur="6.11">they created and remember they created</text>
  <text start="252.31" dur="4.02">the problem in the first place and</text>
  <text start="254.34" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;re going to try to start</text>
  <text start="256.33" dur="7.8">government-run health insurance options</text>
  <text start="260.04" dur="8.62">so they&amp;#39;re telling us more lies to cover</text>
  <text start="264.13" dur="7.47">up their old lies and remember when</text>
  <text start="268.66" dur="5.4">these bills are written by corporations</text>
  <text start="271.6" dur="4.92">they don&amp;#39;t have the people&amp;#39;s best</text>
  <text start="274.06" dur="5.16">interests in mind when the government</text>
  <text start="276.52" dur="6.18">morons go along with this they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="279.22" dur="7.38">have the people&amp;#39;s interests in mind they</text>
  <text start="282.7" dur="6.36">have their own interests and the</text>
  <text start="286.6" dur="5.73">corporations have their interests the</text>
  <text start="289.06" dur="6">people are a side thought and this is</text>
  <text start="292.33" dur="4.74">completely obvious and when you when you</text>
  <text start="295.06" dur="4.41">listen to these debates between these</text>
  <text start="297.07" dur="4.88">two candidates they never went to the</text>
  <text start="299.47" dur="6.99">root of the problem how can you discuss</text>
  <text start="301.95" dur="6.4">the problems of the United States if you</text>
  <text start="306.46" dur="5.519">do not go to the root of the problem if</text>
  <text start="308.35" dur="5.52">you don&amp;#39;t go to what has caused all of</text>
  <text start="311.979" dur="4.411">this it&amp;#39;s like discussing</text>
  <text start="313.87" dur="4.95">Syria you can&amp;#39;t have a discussion about</text>
  <text start="316.39" dur="4.26">Syria unless you go back and you learn</text>
  <text start="318.82" dur="3.81">the history of why the United States is</text>
  <text start="320.65" dur="3.66">there and what the United States has</text>
  <text start="322.63" dur="3.69">done and I&amp;#39;m not talking about the</text>
  <text start="324.31" dur="5.49">people I&amp;#39;m talking about those in</text>
  <text start="326.32" dur="5.52">government where they wanted a pipeline</text>
  <text start="329.8" dur="4.26">Assad didn&amp;#39;t want the pipeline from the</text>
  <text start="331.84" dur="4.92">United States Assad was going to go with</text>
  <text start="334.06" dur="5.36">Iran&amp;#39;s pipeline while the United States</text>
  <text start="336.76" dur="5.97">didn&amp;#39;t like this so they decided to</text>
  <text start="339.42" dur="5.44">overthrow Assad just like they did in</text>
  <text start="342.73" dur="8.46">Libya just like they did in Yemen</text>
  <text start="344.86" dur="9.18">Lebanon Sudan we need to go to the truth</text>
  <text start="351.19" dur="4.83">the facts of what is really going on in</text>
  <text start="354.04" dur="5.31">all of these places and if we don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="356.02" dur="6.12">this we cannot have a discussion at all</text>
  <text start="359.35" dur="6.42">because the discussion makes no sense</text>
  <text start="362.14" dur="5.88">and this is what was happening during</text>
  <text start="365.77" dur="4.35">the debates you couldn&amp;#39;t have a real</text>
  <text start="368.02" dur="5.24">discussion because you&amp;#39;re going along</text>

  <text start="581.23" dur="6.06">how to handle these types of situations</text>
  <text start="583.78" dur="5.82">with they use force and they would love</text>
  <text start="587.29" dur="5.91">to do this they would love to declare a</text>
  <text start="589.6" dur="8.34">state of emergency now if the margin is</text>
  <text start="593.2" dur="6.48">far apart and the popular vote is for</text>
  <text start="597.94" dur="3.99">Trump it&amp;#39;s going to be very difficult</text>

  <text start="621.4" dur="5.43">figure out what has happened and this</text>
  <text start="624.76" dur="4.17">was the preconditioning of a cyber</text>
  <text start="626.83" dur="4.62">attack against Russia so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="628.93" dur="5.88">covering all bases they&amp;#39;re making sure</text>

  <text start="1162.429" dur="8.87">troops down in Syria and Iraq well this</text>
  <text start="1167.71" dur="6.599">was so these countries could fly in and</text>
  <text start="1171.299" dur="5.171">do the bombing runs and this is what</text>
  <text start="1174.309" dur="4.171">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now they use the</text>
  <text start="1176.47" dur="4.559">refugees which turkey released on to</text>
  <text start="1178.48" dur="4.879">Europe to force the European countries</text>

  <text start="1216.1" dur="4.919">is out there saying that we did it were</text>
  <text start="1218.649" dur="3.75">taking credit for this one well I really</text>
  <text start="1221.019" dur="4.941">don&amp;#39;t believe that the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="1222.399" dur="6.181">going to hit their masters so the</text>
  <text start="1225.96" dur="4.539">Pentagon is out there and they are</text>
  <text start="1228.58" dur="4.949">denying all allegations that there was</text>
  <text start="1230.499" dur="6.601">even a downed plane so we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="1233.529" dur="6.181">and wait to hear what has happened maybe</text>
  <text start="1237.1" dur="5.299">this plane was flying and there was some</text>
  <text start="1239.71" dur="6">type of malfunction in the plane or</text>
  <text start="1242.399" dur="5.111">maybe it was one of the Syrian s-300</text>
  <text start="1245.71" dur="3.45">missiles or something that hit it</text>
  <text start="1247.51" dur="3.6">and they don&amp;#39;t want to say anything we</text>
  <text start="1249.16" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t know at this point but we will</text>
  <text start="1251.11" dur="4.56">continually follow up on that we see</text>
  <text start="1253.57" dur="4.71">that President Hollande and Major</text>
  <text start="1255.67" dur="5.01">General Gary Valesky they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="1258.28" dur="6.6">the Islamic state they are moving from</text>
  <text start="1260.68" dur="6.74">muscle and they&amp;#39;re fleeing to Syria just</text>
  <text start="1264.88" dur="5.22">like we thought was going to happen and</text>
  <text start="1267.42" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re moving into</text>
  <text start="1270.1" dur="5.25">Syria and we know why this is happening</text>
  <text start="1272.31" dur="5.38">they&amp;#39;re trying to move them into Syria</text>
  <text start="1275.35" dur="4.56">so they can use them in Aleppo now I</text>
  <text start="1277.69" dur="5.22">think what they&amp;#39;re going to try to do is</text>
  <text start="1279.91" dur="7.77">say that we need more military assets</text>
  <text start="1282.91" dur="8.28">more troops to follow the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1287.68" dur="5.88">into Syria and it will allow the</text>
  <text start="1291.19" dur="5.31">coalition forces to bring in ground</text>
  <text start="1293.56" dur="4.65">troops to follow them into Syria and of</text>
  <text start="1296.5" dur="3.99">course it&amp;#39;s not to destroy the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1298.21" dur="5.66">state it&amp;#39;s to join up with them and to</text>
  <text start="1300.49" dur="7.64">fight in Aleppo and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1303.87" dur="8.32">all of this is coming to a point where</text>
  <text start="1308.13" dur="8.02">the United States is in big trouble they</text>
  <text start="1312.19" dur="5.85">have no options left we know they want</text>
  <text start="1316.15" dur="4.02">to cease fire we know they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1318.04" dur="3.3">be talking about peace because whenever</text>

  <text start="1357.7" dur="5.55">surprised if we see something happen now</text>
  <text start="1360.94" dur="5.22">who are they gonna blame this on they</text>
  <text start="1363.25" dur="6.09">might blame it on Assad most likely that</text>
  <text start="1366.16" dur="6.24">he did this killed many people it would</text>
  <text start="1369.34" dur="7.08">be the perfect false flag and we would</text>
