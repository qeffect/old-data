  <text start="74.229" dur="5.161">we&amp;#39;ve been studying this economy we</text>
  <text start="76.21" dur="6.63">realize that there are many things at</text>
  <text start="79.39" dur="5.339">play at this time now when we look at</text>
  <text start="82.84" dur="3.96">the economy we need to look at the world</text>
  <text start="84.729" dur="5.101">events we need to understand what is</text>
  <text start="86.8" dur="6.03">going on and it&amp;#39;s not just one thing and</text>
  <text start="89.83" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;ve been following the economy here in</text>
  <text start="92.83" dur="4.56">the United States and around the globe</text>
  <text start="94.42" dur="5.16">and we&amp;#39;ve been seeing that bubbles have</text>
  <text start="97.39" dur="4.619">been inflated like there&amp;#39;s no tomorrow</text>
  <text start="99.58" dur="4.77">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="102.009" dur="4.441">to pop in certain areas where price like</text>
  <text start="104.35" dur="4.799">the housing bubble prices are starting</text>
  <text start="106.45" dur="5.279">to come down the mortgage applications</text>

  <text start="111.729" dur="4.371">sidelines investments from foreign</text>
  <text start="114.16" dur="4.11">investors have been drying up because</text>
  <text start="116.1" dur="4.78">everything&amp;#39;s being redirected to the one</text>
  <text start="118.27" dur="5.7">belt one Road and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="120.88" dur="5.07">that all these things are starting to</text>
  <text start="123.97" dur="4.05">take a toll on the real economy the</text>
  <text start="125.95" dur="5.48">stock market is not the real economy the</text>
  <text start="128.02" dur="6.299">stock market is a manipulated piece a</text>
  <text start="131.43" dur="7.48">manipulated tool that the central</text>
  <text start="134.319" dur="6.961">bankers use to convince people the</text>
  <text start="138.91" dur="6.08">economy&amp;#39;s doing well because if the</text>
  <text start="141.28" dur="8.96">Swiss bank who has been funding the</text>
  <text start="144.99" dur="9.43">stock market and if the Fed pulled their</text>
  <text start="150.24" dur="6.25">free money out of the system and let the</text>
  <text start="154.42" dur="4.649">stock market do what it&amp;#39;s supposed to do</text>
  <text start="156.49" dur="5.73">in an open free market it would crash</text>
  <text start="159.069" dur="8.271">today because they&amp;#39;re not buying the</text>
  <text start="162.22" dur="8.879">stocks anymore so this is one gigantic</text>
  <text start="167.34" dur="8.619">manipulation game and it was put into</text>
  <text start="171.099" dur="6.151">place to by the central bankers time now</text>
  <text start="175.959" dur="3.321">there are different central banks that</text>
  <text start="177.25" dur="4.83">report up to the main central bank and</text>
  <text start="179.28" dur="5.08">certain central banks are in line with</text>
  <text start="182.08" dur="5.16">the Cabal like here in the United States</text>
  <text start="184.36" dur="3.15">and what is happening now is the central</text>
  <text start="187.24" dur="2.699">bed</text>
  <text start="187.51" dur="5.399">of all central banks or Roth trials they</text>
  <text start="189.939" dur="6.901">don&amp;#39;t care about the Fed they know the</text>
  <text start="192.909" dur="6.631">Fed is going down they know the dollar</text>
  <text start="196.84" dur="4.77">is dying and they&amp;#39;re prepared and ready</text>
  <text start="199.54" dur="5.009">to set up a brand new one which they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="201.61" dur="6">been doing overtime and it takes time to</text>
  <text start="204.549" dur="4.381">do this it doesn&amp;#39;t happen in a day and I</text>
  <text start="207.61" dur="2.61">know a lot of people like well when are</text>
  <text start="208.93" dur="3.679">they going to do this already it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="210.22" dur="4.59">already being done under your nose</text>
  <text start="212.609" dur="4.72">except that we&amp;#39;ve been following it and</text>
  <text start="214.81" dur="6.33">they&amp;#39;ve been replicating everything out</text>
  <text start="217.329" dur="5.341">in the East and it looks like they</text>
  <text start="221.14" dur="5.28">pretty much have everything there</text>
  <text start="222.67" dur="6.03">everything ready to go and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="226.42" dur="6.51">doing at this point is they are waiting</text>
  <text start="228.7" dur="8.31">for the event the event that will allow</text>
  <text start="232.93" dur="6.27">them to push everything from here to</text>
  <text start="237.01" dur="4.949">there now everyone thinks well China</text>
  <text start="239.2" dur="4.11">created the petro u1 and I know the</text>
  <text start="241.959" dur="2.37">financial pundits are out there and</text>
  <text start="243.31" dur="2.399">they&amp;#39;re saying well this is gonna take</text>
  <text start="244.329" dur="3.541">some time they have a very small market</text>
  <text start="245.709" dur="4.95">and countries are gonna have to get on</text>
  <text start="247.87" dur="4.709">board no that&amp;#39;s not how the central</text>
  <text start="250.659" dur="4.23">bankers work think about the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="252.579" dur="7.56">I mean did they start the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="254.889" dur="7.801">back in 1920 and had the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="260.139" dur="3.871">throughout that time and finally people</text>
  <text start="262.69" dur="3.81">started to use the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="264.01" dur="4.83">or did they start the petrodollar I mean</text>
  <text start="266.5" dur="5.91">I had plans ahead of time everything was</text>
  <text start="268.84" dur="6.96">prepped for it but did they go live with</text>
  <text start="272.41" dur="6.81">the pep petrodollar in 1971 when we came</text>
  <text start="275.8" dur="5.6">off the gold standard that is what</text>
  <text start="279.22" dur="5.43">happened and everyone started to use it</text>
  <text start="281.4" dur="5.739">there was no event there was nothing</text>
  <text start="284.65" dur="5.34">there they just went ahead and they did</text>
  <text start="287.139" dur="5.101">it today it&amp;#39;s a little different today</text>
  <text start="289.99" dur="5.58">the petro dollar most of the countries</text>
  <text start="292.24" dur="5.82">use it so what do they need to do all</text>
  <text start="295.57" dur="5.61">they need is to have some type of an</text>
  <text start="298.06" dur="5.55">event that will distract everyone for a</text>
  <text start="301.18" dur="4.44">year or two years and then turn the</text>
  <text start="303.61" dur="4.5">switch on and say okay the dollars dead</text>
  <text start="305.62" dur="6.539">now we&amp;#39;re on the Petra you want that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="308.11" dur="6.239">all they have to do or have something</text>
  <text start="312.159" dur="5.281">happen to the financial system of the</text>
  <text start="314.349" dur="4.56">United States of the Fed that could be</text>
  <text start="317.44" dur="3.93">with a cyberattack that could be with</text>
  <text start="318.909" dur="4.771">anything and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="321.37" dur="3.51">they can switch it and all the central</text>
  <text start="323.68" dur="4.23">banks around the world all they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="324.88" dur="5.75">do is dump the dollar and take on the</text>
  <text start="327.91" dur="6.27">petrol you want they don&amp;#39;t need time</text>
  <text start="330.63" dur="5.77">time is meaningless they can do it with</text>
  <text start="334.18" dur="4.26">a snap of a finger they don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="336.4" dur="5.19">wait for China to build anything up it</text>
  <text start="338.44" dur="6.75">doesn&amp;#39;t need to be done everything is</text>
  <text start="341.59" dur="8.16">already in place and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="345.19" dur="6.9">is that the economy is prepared and</text>
  <text start="349.75" dur="4.59">ready to be brought down basically what</text>
  <text start="352.09" dur="6.359">is happening is Trump has been in office</text>
  <text start="354.34" dur="8.19">for a year now he has his tax bill that</text>
  <text start="358.449" dur="7.021">he pushed through he has everything that</text>
  <text start="362.53" dur="5.07">he&amp;#39;s been doing and the people are</text>
  <text start="365.47" dur="3.569">convinced because the economists came</text>
  <text start="367.6" dur="3.72">out and the corporate media came out</text>
  <text start="369.039" dur="4.44">said this is Trump&amp;#39;s economy now and</text>
  <text start="371.32" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s been over a year and eventually</text>
  <text start="373.479" dur="5.851">that that&amp;#39;s what happens it&amp;#39;s now his</text>
  <text start="376" dur="6.87">economy he owns it and they were waiting</text>
  <text start="379.33" dur="5.309">for this moment and I&amp;#39;m saying in the</text>
  <text start="382.87" dur="4.229">next couple of months probably February</text>
  <text start="384.639" dur="5.521">March going into April we&amp;#39;re gonna start</text>
  <text start="387.099" dur="7.201">to see the corporate media come out and</text>
  <text start="390.16" dur="6.09">tell you how the economy is not doing so</text>
  <text start="394.3" dur="4.26">well how it&amp;#39;s starting to turn down a</text>
  <text start="396.25" dur="4.139">little bit a lot of financial pundits</text>
  <text start="398.56" dur="4.079">out there like Bank of America they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="400.389" dur="4.081">talking about how the market is so</text>
  <text start="402.639" dur="5.161">overvalued that they&amp;#39;re waiting for the</text>
  <text start="404.47" dur="6.77">market to come down and again the market</text>
  <text start="407.8" dur="4.95">is manipulated it&amp;#39;s not the real economy</text>
  <text start="411.24" dur="5.32">think about it</text>
  <text start="412.75" dur="6.09">prior to Trump the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="416.56" dur="5.669">were manipulated the GDP numbers were</text>
  <text start="418.84" dur="5.91">manipulated everything was manipulated</text>
  <text start="422.229" dur="6.021">and then Trump came into office the</text>
  <text start="424.75" dur="6.83">manipulation continued it didn&amp;#39;t stop</text>
  <text start="428.25" dur="5.71">unemployment didn&amp;#39;t just miraculously</text>
  <text start="431.58" dur="4.45">rebuild itself and everything is fine</text>
  <text start="433.96" dur="4.35">and they did all the recalculations and</text>
  <text start="436.03" dur="3.54">everything&amp;#39;s perfect it&amp;#39;s exactly the</text>
  <text start="438.31" dur="5.07">same actually more people have lost</text>
  <text start="439.57" dur="6.21">their jobs since that point because this</text>
  <text start="443.38" dur="4.319">economy is fake it&amp;#39;s not real it looks</text>
  <text start="445.78" dur="5.069">like it&amp;#39;s doing well it also looked like</text>
  <text start="447.699" dur="6.631">it was doing very very well in the year</text>
  <text start="450.849" dur="4.301">of 2008 even though we were stuck in</text>
  <text start="454.33" dur="3.82">this illusion</text>
  <text start="455.15" dur="5.78">that the Supreme Securities were perfect</text>
  <text start="458.15" dur="5.85">triple-a hey wait the United States is</text>
  <text start="460.93" dur="5.59">triple-a rated by S&amp;amp;P Moody&amp;#39;s Fitch</text>
  <text start="464" dur="4.11">but China looked at it and said with a</text>
  <text start="466.52" dur="2.31">lot of debt we didn&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t trust</text>
  <text start="468.11" dur="3.9">them anymore</text>
  <text start="468.83" dur="6.06">confidence is declining and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="472.01" dur="6.66">lower their credit rating this is in</text>
  <text start="474.89" dur="8.25">preparation to be moved over to China to</text>
  <text start="478.67" dur="6.45">the new central bank system and we see</text>
  <text start="483.14" dur="4.35">right now that this is the illusion</text>
  <text start="485.12" dur="5.37">actually SMP wanted a downgrade the</text>
  <text start="487.49" dur="5.84">United States and actually they the</text>
  <text start="490.49" dur="5.43">government at that time stopped them</text>
  <text start="493.33" dur="4.78">because they knew if they did that their</text>
  <text start="495.92" dur="3.96">plan would not work they thought they</text>
  <text start="498.11" dur="3.96">were going to be in power for a lot</text>
  <text start="499.88" dur="5.55">longer the Cabal intertwined with the</text>
  <text start="502.07" dur="5.73">central bank but they weren&amp;#39;t and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="505.43" dur="3.78">starting to see things slip around the</text>
  <text start="507.8" dur="3.51">world we talked about Canada to the</text>
  <text start="509.21" dur="4.53">housing market there in Vancouver we</text>
  <text start="511.31" dur="4.44">talked about it in Toronto and we talked</text>
  <text start="513.74" dur="5.64">about Australia we talked about the UK</text>
  <text start="515.75" dur="6.6">how their housing market is declining we</text>
  <text start="519.38" dur="6.36">also see out in the UK retail sales they</text>
  <text start="522.35" dur="4.98">have declined sharply in December which</text>
  <text start="525.74" dur="4.2">is strange because December is usually a</text>
  <text start="527.33" dur="5.97">very good month because it&amp;#39;s the holiday</text>
  <text start="529.94" dur="6.3">season and retail sales fell by 1.5</text>
  <text start="533.3" dur="4.74">percent in December and this is the</text>
  <text start="536.24" dur="6.57">latest sign that consumers were feeling</text>
  <text start="538.04" dur="6.93">the strain of falling real pay the same</text>
  <text start="542.81" dur="4.11">thing here in the United States wages</text>
  <text start="544.97" dur="5.4">are declining people are losing their</text>
  <text start="546.92" dur="7.02">jobs in retail people are losing their</text>
  <text start="550.37" dur="4.86">jobs the corporate illusion that</text>
  <text start="553.94" dur="3.87">everything is fine where the</text>
  <text start="555.23" dur="4.56">corporations are doing well the stocks</text>
  <text start="557.81" dur="5.58">are continually moving up but their</text>
  <text start="559.79" dur="5.13">sales their revenue they&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="563.39" dur="3.9">there all they&amp;#39;re doing is buying back</text>
  <text start="564.92" dur="5.13">their stocks to push the market up and</text>
  <text start="567.29" dur="5.46">up and up we see the U much confidence</text>
  <text start="570.05" dur="5.24">well it is reversed itself now and now</text>
  <text start="572.75" dur="5.28">it is declining sharply</text>
  <text start="575.29" dur="6.7">because what has happened was the</text>
  <text start="578.03" dur="7.71">euphoria is over they&amp;#39;re prepared and</text>
  <text start="581.99" dur="6.36">ready to shift everything and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="585.74" dur="4.68">gonna see a lot of information come out</text>
  <text start="588.35" dur="5.37">and they&amp;#39;re gonna start talking about</text>
  <text start="590.42" dur="6.69">how the economy is starting to slip a</text>
  <text start="593.72" dur="7.53">little bit and this is the beginning of</text>
  <text start="597.11" dur="6.84">it all because as we know illusions</text>
  <text start="601.25" dur="5.58">don&amp;#39;t last forever I mean eventually</text>
  <text start="603.95" dur="6.42">what happens and time is meaningless</text>
  <text start="606.83" dur="7.08">they always fall apart look at history</text>
  <text start="610.37" dur="6.3">history is a great piece of evidence</text>
  <text start="613.91" dur="5.76">that shows us that every time the market</text>
  <text start="616.67" dur="8.4">hits an all-time high and housing prices</text>
  <text start="619.67" dur="10.83">go up everyone feels good even though</text>
  <text start="625.07" dur="8.34">it&amp;#39;s fake think about 2008 everyone was</text>
  <text start="630.5" dur="4.83">feeling fantastic look how much money I</text>
  <text start="633.41" dur="3.57">made in my house I can take it out I can</text>
  <text start="635.33" dur="2.91">take out an equity line of credit this</text>
  <text start="636.98" dur="3.03">is why they came out with that report</text>
  <text start="638.24" dur="4.2">saying there&amp;#39;s about three something</text>
  <text start="640.01" dur="4.41">trillion dollars in home equity because</text>
  <text start="642.44" dur="4.56">they want people to take that money</text>
  <text start="644.42" dur="5.04">spend it in retail spend it in the</text>
  <text start="647" dur="4.8">economy and actually take out another</text>
  <text start="649.46" dur="5.1">loan because how does the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="651.8" dur="6.29">work they work on people taking out more</text>
  <text start="654.56" dur="7.08">and more debt this is what they like and</text>
  <text start="658.09" dur="6.1">once again we&amp;#39;re at that same point once</text>
  <text start="661.64" dur="4.83">once again we&amp;#39;re at that point of</text>
  <text start="664.19" dur="5.79">euphoria where everything feels</text>
  <text start="666.47" dur="6.69">fantastic and this is when they do the</text>
  <text start="669.98" dur="5.54">old switcheroo this is when they start</text>
  <text start="673.16" dur="5.94">to bring everything down now they have</text>
  <text start="675.52" dur="5.95">someone to blame and it will be attached</text>
  <text start="679.1" dur="5.37">most likely to another country or group</text>
  <text start="681.47" dur="6.21">to even push this agenda further because</text>
  <text start="684.47" dur="5.94">the central bank once again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="687.68" dur="4.11">doing everything in their best interest</text>
  <text start="690.41" dur="3.93">not for the interest of the people</text>
  <text start="691.79" dur="5.55">because if it was truly for the</text>
  <text start="694.34" dur="5.91">interests of the people would they put</text>
  <text start="697.34" dur="6.15">people into debt would they put</text>

  <text start="707.27" dur="8.73">it&amp;#39;s for we the people they would never</text>
  <text start="711.32" dur="7.77">put countries people into debt and make</text>
  <text start="716" dur="5.85">it impossible for them to pay this debt</text>
  <text start="719.09" dur="7.08">off they would issue the</text>
  <text start="721.85" dur="7.109">currency without interest so all the</text>
  <text start="726.17" dur="5.159">currency that was issued if it was paid</text>
  <text start="728.959" dur="3.661">all back it would pay off all that</text>
  <text start="731.329" dur="3.841">currency that was issued</text>

  <text start="739.1" dur="5.34">just by the central bank issuing the</text>

  <text start="744.44" dur="7.319">is very very different because how else</text>
  <text start="748.22" dur="6.09">can you control countries by putting</text>
  <text start="751.759" dur="4.76">them into debt that&amp;#39;s the best way</text>
  <text start="754.31" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;ve done it throughout history and</text>
  <text start="756.519" dur="6.76">now it is time to remove this central</text>
  <text start="760.13" dur="6.689">bank the private central bank and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="763.279" dur="6.891">time to have the people issue their own</text>
  <text start="766.819" dur="6.83">currency with nothing attached to it and</text>
  <text start="770.17" dur="7.419">I believe this is what cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="773.649" dur="7.24">can do if the central banks don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="777.589" dur="5.281">control over them if the people have</text>
  <text start="780.889" dur="4.801">control over this currency the currency</text>
  <text start="782.87" dur="6.089">would be issued without any type of</text>

  <text start="796.939" dur="3.691">about fractional reserve banking we</text>
  <text start="799.399" dur="5.55">would have to worry about any of this</text>
  <text start="800.63" dur="7.17">stuff and the governments around the</text>
  <text start="804.949" dur="6.721">world couldn&amp;#39;t just borrow and borrow</text>
  <text start="807.8" dur="8.25">and borrow and spend and borrow because</text>
  <text start="811.67" dur="7.169">there be checks and balances so they</text>
  <text start="816.05" dur="5.729">would have to do things like they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="818.839" dur="5.131">done before with the currency attached</text>
  <text start="821.779" dur="4.56">to gold where gold was the checks and</text>
  <text start="823.97" dur="5.28">balances they just couldn&amp;#39;t go and spend</text>

  <text start="841.399" dur="4.5">have some here and there but it wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="843.86" dur="4.56">be the way it is today because the</text>
  <text start="845.899" dur="4.591">central bank is more than happy to</text>
  <text start="848.42" dur="3.889">create currency with the push of a</text>
  <text start="850.49" dur="4.89">button because it&amp;#39;s unlimited it&amp;#39;s</text>
