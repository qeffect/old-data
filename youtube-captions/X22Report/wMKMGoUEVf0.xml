  <text start="91.08" dur="5.01">months Trump is going to be pushing the</text>
  <text start="93.54" dur="4.05">central bank to cut rates and we see</text>
  <text start="96.09" dur="4.26">that the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="97.59" dur="5.94">already getting out in front of the</text>
  <text start="100.35" dur="6.78">entire story by telling the American</text>
  <text start="103.53" dur="5.37">people it&amp;#39;s not going to help you and it</text>
  <text start="107.13" dur="3.96">looks like the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="108.9" dur="6">taking the side of the central bank and</text>
  <text start="111.09" dur="6.66">not the side of Trump of course but the</text>
  <text start="114.9" dur="5.67">point of the entire push right now their</text>
  <text start="117.75" dur="5.31">narrative is to say what he&amp;#39;s about to</text>
  <text start="120.57" dur="5.28">do and what he&amp;#39;s trying to force the</text>
  <text start="123.06" dur="6.089">central bank to do is not going to help</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="7.59">anybody and they do this in many many</text>
  <text start="129.149" dur="6.891">different articles outlining each sector</text>
  <text start="133.44" dur="5.49">to show you how it&amp;#39;s not going to help</text>
  <text start="136.04" dur="5.62">but they leave out something very</text>
  <text start="138.93" dur="6.6">important and the important thing is</text>
  <text start="141.66" dur="7.53">it&amp;#39;s not about helping the everyday</text>
  <text start="145.53" dur="5.88">person by having the rates cut it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="149.19" dur="4.109">about helping the everyday person by</text>
  <text start="151.41" dur="4.98">getting rid of the central bank and</text>
  <text start="153.299" dur="5.761">having the economy continue on until the</text>
  <text start="156.39" dur="6.42">2020 election so he can win again and</text>
  <text start="159.06" dur="5.91">then move fast forward to remove the</text>
  <text start="162.81" dur="3.3">central bank and will</text>
  <text start="164.97" dur="4.26">be going through all that in a little</text>
  <text start="166.11" dur="7.38">bit but first we realize that there has</text>
  <text start="169.23" dur="6.98">been no deal with China China came to</text>
  <text start="173.49" dur="5.67">the United States they negotiated and</text>
  <text start="176.21" dur="6.79">basically China left now the question is</text>
  <text start="179.16" dur="8.73">why well there are very good reasons why</text>
  <text start="183" dur="8.22">they left because China was trying to</text>
  <text start="187.89" dur="8.49">manipulate the trade talks in their</text>
  <text start="191.22" dur="7.5">favor and Trump is holding firm right</text>
  <text start="196.38" dur="6.45">now on his campaign promises to confront</text>
  <text start="198.72" dur="6.57">China and have them renegotiate all</text>
  <text start="202.83" dur="5.16">trade deals and we need to remember</text>
  <text start="205.29" dur="5.16">something very important is that over</text>
  <text start="207.99" dur="4.65">the many many years where leaders got</text>
  <text start="210.45" dur="5.04">together and they hammered out some type</text>
  <text start="212.64" dur="5.16">of trade deal in a day or two and</text>
  <text start="215.49" dur="4.53">everything was perfect that because</text>
  <text start="217.8" dur="5.97">that&amp;#39;s because there was really no</text>
  <text start="220.02" dur="7.29">negotiation the past administrations</text>
  <text start="223.77" dur="6.6">were just giving up everything and a</text>
  <text start="227.31" dur="5.58">real negotiation goes back and forth and</text>
  <text start="230.37" dur="5.52">actually sometimes people leave the</text>
  <text start="232.89" dur="5.79">negotiations because they become angry</text>
  <text start="235.89" dur="5.4">because they don&amp;#39;t want to give and then</text>
  <text start="238.68" dur="5.07">later on when they see that it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="241.29" dur="4.86">not going their way they come back to</text>
  <text start="243.75" dur="3.69">the negotiation table this is what it</text>
  <text start="246.15" dur="3.9">looks like when there&amp;#39;s a real</text>
  <text start="247.44" dur="4.86">negotiation I mean you can use the</text>
  <text start="250.05" dur="5.189">example of when you go in to purchase a</text>
  <text start="252.3" dur="5.189">automobile some people go in the</text>
  <text start="255.239" dur="4.111">salesperson says okay this is the price</text>
  <text start="257.489" dur="4.291">and they agree to it and they buy the</text>
  <text start="259.35" dur="5.34">car other people go in there and they</text>
  <text start="261.78" dur="5.07">say no I don&amp;#39;t like that price I want</text>
  <text start="264.69" dur="8.01">something better and they sit there for</text>
  <text start="266.85" dur="8.4">hours until someone gives that&amp;#39;s a real</text>
  <text start="272.7" dur="5.73">negotiation some people even walk out</text>
  <text start="275.25" dur="5.94">and might not return or sometimes they</text>
  <text start="278.43" dur="5.25">do return or the dealer calls them back</text>
  <text start="281.19" dur="4.95">and say okay listen we can now do that</text>
  <text start="283.68" dur="6">deal so during this negotiation with</text>
  <text start="286.14" dur="5.82">China there was this 150 page draft</text>
  <text start="289.68" dur="7.26">agreement that was presented to the</text>
  <text start="291.96" dur="7.95">Chinese team Beijing balked at allowing</text>
  <text start="296.94" dur="5.52">the us to hold controlling enforcement</text>
  <text start="299.91" dur="4.8">over the trade agreement terms the</text>
  <text start="302.46" dur="4.41">fallback presentation from vice chairman</text>
  <text start="304.71" dur="5.1">Liu was we cannot put the binding</text>
  <text start="306.87" dur="5.669">enforcement mechanisms in writing you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="309.81" dur="6.62">have to trust us to honor the agreement</text>
  <text start="312.539" dur="6.69">at which time light Hauser said no way</text>
  <text start="316.43" dur="4.96">we need this in writing we&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="319.229" dur="5.31">go by your word I mean think about it</text>
  <text start="321.39" dur="4.86">would you ever go by someone&amp;#39;s word if</text>
  <text start="324.539" dur="4.171">you&amp;#39;re purchasing a house you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="326.25" dur="5.28">purchasing a car or anything else or</text>
  <text start="328.71" dur="4.34">would you want it all in writing you</text>
  <text start="331.53" dur="4.889">want it in writing</text>
  <text start="333.05" dur="5.65">light Hauser and Trump are not only</text>
  <text start="336.419" dur="5.31">fighting China they&amp;#39;re fighting US</text>
  <text start="338.7" dur="5.94">politicians or beneficiaries of China</text>
  <text start="341.729" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re also fighting against US</text>
  <text start="344.64" dur="4.92">corporations Wall Street and members of</text>
  <text start="347.669" dur="5.091">both political parties who desperately</text>
  <text start="349.56" dur="6.12">want to stop any trade balance reset</text>
  <text start="352.76" dur="6.25">almost half or maybe even more of</text>
  <text start="355.68" dur="7.739">Congress they have financial</text>
  <text start="359.01" dur="6.87">self-interest if China can gain economic</text>
  <text start="363.419" dur="5.281">superiority over the United States</text>
  <text start="365.88" dur="5.07">oh that brings me to Biden if you really</text>
  <text start="368.7" dur="3.719">think about it who had deals with China</text>
  <text start="370.95" dur="4.26">who&amp;#39;s saying that China&amp;#39;s not really</text>
  <text start="372.419" dur="4.411">that big of a deal but China is a really</text>
  <text start="375.21" dur="3.209">big deal think about it</text>
  <text start="376.83" dur="3.66">Trump is not listening to Wall Street</text>
  <text start="378.419" dur="4.351">he&amp;#39;s not listening to those people in</text>
  <text start="380.49" dur="5.13">government who have interest in China</text>
  <text start="382.77" dur="6.03">becoming a powerhouse who have</text>
  <text start="385.62" dur="7.16">investments with China he&amp;#39;s listening to</text>
  <text start="388.8" dur="8.97">the people he&amp;#39;s doing it so America is</text>
  <text start="392.78" dur="7.93">great again where we are in control of</text>
  <text start="397.77" dur="5.97">trade manufacturing corporations and and</text>
  <text start="400.71" dur="6.18">everything else Trump tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="403.74" dur="5.22">finally I think that China felt they</text>
  <text start="406.89" dur="4.35">were being beaten so badly in the recent</text>
  <text start="408.96" dur="4.4">negotiation that they that they may as</text>
  <text start="411.24" dur="5.16">well wait around for the next election</text>
  <text start="413.36" dur="5.71">2020 to see if they could get lucky and</text>
  <text start="416.4" dur="4.769">have a Democrat win in which case they</text>
  <text start="419.07" dur="5.25">would continue to rip off the USA for</text>
  <text start="421.169" dur="5.641">five hundred billion a year the only</text>
  <text start="424.32" dur="4.01">problem is that they know I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="426.81" dur="3.169">win bet</text>
  <text start="428.33" dur="4.23">economy and employment numbers in US</text>
  <text start="429.979" dur="5.37">history and much more and the deal will</text>
  <text start="432.56" dur="5.789">become far worse for them if it has to</text>
  <text start="435.349" dur="6.12">be negotiated in my second term would be</text>
  <text start="438.349" dur="7.91">wise for them to act now but love</text>
  <text start="441.469" dur="8.281">collecting big tariffs and who knows</text>
  <text start="446.259" dur="6.671">China might say oK we&amp;#39;ve given it some</text>
  <text start="449.75" dur="4.65">thought we will put it in writing and we</text>
  <text start="452.93" dur="3.78">need to remember we&amp;#39;ve been brainwashed</text>
  <text start="454.4" dur="5.009">to think this is how certain things</text>
  <text start="456.71" dur="4.65">happen it&amp;#39;s almost like with the Fed who</text>
  <text start="459.409" dur="3.871">controls interest rates it&amp;#39;s not a free</text>
  <text start="461.36" dur="3.6">market the free market is not dictating</text>
  <text start="463.28" dur="3.96">what the interest rate should be the Fed</text>
  <text start="464.96" dur="4.23">is we&amp;#39;ve been brainwashed over many many</text>
  <text start="467.24" dur="4.229">years to think that this is the way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="469.19" dur="3.36">supposed to be well everyone&amp;#39;s supposed</text>
  <text start="471.469" dur="3.48">to be in debt this is the way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="472.55" dur="4.709">supposed to big trade negotiations well</text>
  <text start="474.949" dur="4.68">they they&amp;#39;re done in an hour and China</text>
  <text start="477.259" dur="4.38">gets everything or another country gets</text>
  <text start="479.629" dur="4.53">everything or the European Union gets</text>
  <text start="481.639" dur="5.191">everything now we&amp;#39;re having real</text>
  <text start="484.159" dur="5.76">negotiations they&amp;#39;re up against someone</text>
  <text start="486.83" dur="5.67">who says I&amp;#39;m not gonna give we want what</text>
  <text start="489.919" dur="4.62">we want and guess what you&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="492.5" dur="3.69">to sit here and negotiate and it might</text>
  <text start="494.539" dur="3.921">take a very long time but in the</text>
  <text start="496.19" dur="4.71">meantime while you&amp;#39;re thinking about it</text>
  <text start="498.46" dur="5.919">we&amp;#39;re gonna be collecting billions and</text>
  <text start="500.9" dur="6.199">billions of dollars from you let me know</text>
  <text start="504.379" dur="5.521">when you don&amp;#39;t want to do this anymore</text>
  <text start="507.099" dur="4.99">because out in China they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="509.9" dur="5.129">saying because of these tariffs on China</text>
  <text start="512.089" dur="6.541">their GDP is gonna drop anywhere from</text>
  <text start="515.029" dur="6.81">0.3 to 0.5 percent maybe even more we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="518.63" dur="5.31">have to say we see China&amp;#39;s car sales</text>
  <text start="521.839" dur="3.411">they&amp;#39;re tanking by sixteen point six</text>
  <text start="523.94" dur="4.62">percent in April</text>
  <text start="525.25" dur="5.44">they&amp;#39;ve been falling for 11 months in a</text>
  <text start="528.56" dur="4.08">row now yes I know the rest of the world</text>
  <text start="530.69" dur="4.86">everyone has experienced the same thing</text>
  <text start="532.64" dur="5.37">but China&amp;#39;s their car industry is</text>
  <text start="535.55" dur="4.14">sinking very very rapidly and with these</text>
  <text start="538.01" dur="3.99">tariffs in place and everything else I</text>
  <text start="539.69" dur="4.98">think they&amp;#39;re gonna go down very very</text>
  <text start="542" dur="5.55">quickly now it looks like the mainstream</text>
  <text start="544.67" dur="4.8">media is out there and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="547.55" dur="3.42">get ahead of what is coming and we know</text>
  <text start="549.47" dur="3.989">that Trump he&amp;#39;s gonna be out there</text>
  <text start="550.97" dur="5.16">telling the central bank we need to cut</text>
  <text start="553.459" dur="3.87">rates we need to cut rates and CNBC and</text>
  <text start="556.13" dur="4.079">there&amp;#39;s many other articles out there</text>
  <text start="557.329" dur="4.801">they put up an article Trump verse the</text>
  <text start="560.209" dur="4.741">Fed now that&amp;#39;s very interesting too</text>
  <text start="562.13" dur="5.55">start off with Trump verse the Fed what</text>
  <text start="564.95" dur="6.69">it means for your money and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="567.68" dur="6.81">trying to create this case that Trump</text>
  <text start="571.64" dur="6.36">pushing the Fed to lowering interest</text>
  <text start="574.49" dur="5.96">rates is not going to help you so this</text>
  <text start="578" dur="5.49">is what they&amp;#39;re saying credit card users</text>
  <text start="580.45" dur="4.78">most credit cards have a variable rate</text>
  <text start="583.49" dur="3.42">which means there&amp;#39;s a direct connection</text>
  <text start="585.23" dur="4.05">to the feds benchmark rate for example</text>
  <text start="586.91" dur="4.14">every time the Fed raises rates by a</text>
  <text start="589.28" dur="3.36">quarter point you&amp;#39;ll pay an extra two</text>
  <text start="591.05" dur="3.63">dollars fifty cents a year for every</text>
  <text start="592.64" dur="4.56">thousand dollars worth of debt which</text>
  <text start="594.68" dur="4.65">takes effect within one to two billing</text>
  <text start="597.2" dur="5.04">cycles rate cuts however don&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="599.33" dur="6.03">exactly the same way to the detriment of</text>
  <text start="602.24" dur="5.07">consumers there&amp;#39;s a lag if you look at</text>
  <text start="605.36" dur="4.05">credit card agreements the language they</text>
  <text start="607.31" dur="5.28">use allows them to use the highest prime</text>
  <text start="609.41" dur="5.58">rate as of the last 60 days it gives</text>
  <text start="612.59" dur="4.26">them latitude to quickly pass on a rate</text>
  <text start="614.99" dur="4.17">hike but drag their feet on a rate cut</text>
  <text start="616.85" dur="4.59">now first of all credit cards that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="619.16" dur="4.29">like loan sharking right off the bat and</text>
  <text start="621.44" dur="4.08">is this really gonna help the</text>
  <text start="623.45" dur="3.9">individuals that are deep in debt no of</text>
  <text start="625.52" dur="5.25">course not the rate cuts don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="627.35" dur="6.18">anything for this homebuyers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="630.77" dur="4.86">saying for example for every quarter</text>
  <text start="633.53" dur="3.66">point drop in rate on a hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="635.63" dur="3.12">balance the borrower is going to save</text>
  <text start="637.19" dur="3.36">about twenty one dollars a month and</text>
  <text start="638.75" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s really not that big</text>
  <text start="640.55" dur="6.72">of a deal the part they left out from</text>
  <text start="643.4" dur="7.38">this is that when Trump has the Fed cut</text>
  <text start="647.27" dur="6.47">rates it brings more buyers into the</text>
  <text start="650.78" dur="7.26">market because now people can afford</text>
  <text start="653.74" dur="6.73">homes because when the rate goes up you</text>
  <text start="658.04" dur="4.26">can&amp;#39;t borrow as much when the rate goes</text>
  <text start="660.47" dur="3.69">down those people that were thrown out</text>

  <text start="755.149" dur="4.531">getting rid of the Fed and you can see</text>
  <text start="757.85" dur="4.35">already the mainstream media they are</text>
  <text start="759.68" dur="5.52">now building the narrative that what</text>
  <text start="762.2" dur="6.36">he&amp;#39;s doing will not benefit the everyday</text>
  <text start="765.2" dur="6.09">person but in the long run it will</text>
  <text start="768.56" dur="4.89">benefit the everyday person and it will</text>

  <text start="779.23" dur="7.66">they were all for the rate cuts how</text>
  <text start="781.88" dur="9.27">great it is look at this why because</text>
  <text start="786.89" dur="6.99">they knew the economy was in an awful</text>
  <text start="791.15" dur="5.39">awful place and the rate cuts would</text>
  <text start="793.88" dur="4.86">allow the economy to look fantastic</text>
  <text start="796.54" dur="4.48">that&amp;#39;s what Trump is doing right now</text>
  <text start="798.74" dur="4.95">he&amp;#39;s doing the same exact thing now</text>
  <text start="801.02" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re trying to point that at</text>
  <text start="803.69" dur="3.21">everything saying it&amp;#39;s really not gonna</text>
  <text start="804.98" dur="5.609">help it didn&amp;#39;t help during Obama either</text>
  <text start="806.9" dur="5.1">but what did it allow the mainstream</text>
  <text start="810.589" dur="3.99">media the central bank in the Obama</text>
  <text start="812" dur="6.06">administration to do it allowed everyone</text>
  <text start="814.579" dur="6.331">to look at the stock market at GDP</text>
  <text start="818.06" dur="6.17">numbers at unemployment and if you</text>
  <text start="820.91" dur="5.49">notice during that period of time Obama</text>
  <text start="824.23" dur="3.91">continually said the economy is getting</text>
  <text start="826.4" dur="3">stronger look the unemployment rate is</text>
  <text start="828.14" dur="3.78">coming down a little bit</text>
  <text start="829.4" dur="4.74">each time look the stock market is</text>

  <text start="836.33" dur="4.23">little bit better now their entire</text>
  <text start="838.43" dur="2.97">narrative was to say this is going to be</text>
  <text start="840.56" dur="3.33">the new normal</text>
  <text start="841.4" dur="5.189">they&amp;#39;re not gonna go up very quickly</text>
  <text start="843.89" dur="3.51">it&amp;#39;s gonna stay around this area get</text>
  <text start="846.589" dur="4.621">used to it</text>
  <text start="847.4" dur="5.879">Trump since he has the magic wand he is</text>
  <text start="851.21" dur="4.11">pushing this to the extreme because he</text>
  <text start="853.279" dur="6.241">knows he needs the he needs to have the</text>
  <text start="855.32" dur="7.29">economy look the best it has ever been</text>
  <text start="859.52" dur="6.06">to have everyone say we don&amp;#39;t want</text>

  <text start="880.37" dur="4.35">knows this Trump is doing the same exact</text>
  <text start="883.16" dur="3.78">thing and this is why it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="884.72" dur="4.17">difficult for the mainstream media to</text>
  <text start="886.94" dur="4.11">say look the economy&amp;#39;s not doing well</text>
