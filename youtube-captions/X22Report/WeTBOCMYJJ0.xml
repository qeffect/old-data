  <text start="105.7" dur="5.309">meet any of this because their entire</text>
  <text start="107.89" dur="5.82">system creates inflation as they put out</text>
  <text start="111.009" dur="4.411">more currency guess what there&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="113.71" dur="3.449">dollars in circulation which means</text>
  <text start="115.42" dur="3.93">there&amp;#39;s going to be inflation and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="117.159" dur="5.28">been seeing this since they came into</text>
  <text start="119.35" dur="3.75">power especially once we came off the</text>
  <text start="122.439" dur="4.081">gold standard</text>
  <text start="123.1" dur="5.159">we saw inflation really ramped up now of</text>
  <text start="126.52" dur="3.269">course they&amp;#39;re not even following their</text>
  <text start="128.259" dur="3.721">mandate right now that mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="129.789" dur="5.161">looking for a 2% inflation rate which</text>
  <text start="131.98" dur="6.599">doesn&amp;#39;t go with what their mandate says</text>
  <text start="134.95" dur="5.25">they need to do but Congress they can</text>
  <text start="138.579" dur="4.561">change all this and it looks like</text>
  <text start="140.2" dur="6.81">there&amp;#39;s coals out there to change their</text>
  <text start="143.14" dur="7.28">dual mandate into a single mandate which</text>
  <text start="147.01" dur="7.86">means the restructuring process is</text>
  <text start="150.42" dur="6.51">beginning and we also know that Trump he</text>
  <text start="154.87" dur="4.89">is going to be putting certain</text>
  <text start="156.93" dur="6.61">individuals on the Fed board to</text>
  <text start="159.76" dur="5.23">restructure the Fed yes Kaine is out but</text>
  <text start="163.54" dur="4.57">it looks like there&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="164.99" dur="5.31">contender who likes the gold-standard</text>
  <text start="168.11" dur="4.53">we&amp;#39;ll be talking about that in just a</text>
  <text start="170.3" dur="4.86">minute but I wanted to talk about the</text>
  <text start="172.64" dur="5.28">central bank economy right now it is</text>
  <text start="175.16" dur="4.41">completely falling apart and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="177.92" dur="4.38">getting worse for the people yes with</text>
  <text start="179.57" dur="5.34">the manipulated numbers you cannot see</text>
  <text start="182.3" dur="4.83">it I mean Obama was doing this while he</text>
  <text start="184.91" dur="4.35">was president but you saw all the</text>
  <text start="187.13" dur="5.01">businesses fall apart he wasn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="189.26" dur="4.11">pushing the economy the way Trump is</text>
  <text start="192.14" dur="2.07">pushing and he&amp;#39;s doing it for a</text>
  <text start="193.37" dur="2.34">different reason</text>
  <text start="194.21" dur="3.15">this way the mainstream media that he</text>
  <text start="195.71" dur="4.02">date the central bank can&amp;#39;t fight back</text>
  <text start="197.36" dur="4.56">against him because all he has to do is</text>
  <text start="199.73" dur="3.48">show look at the stock market look at my</text>
  <text start="201.92" dur="4.32">GDP numbers look at my unemployment</text>
  <text start="203.21" dur="6.42">numbers these are all the numbers they</text>
  <text start="206.24" dur="5.58">have been using in the past and what are</text>
  <text start="209.63" dur="3.48">they gonna do they&amp;#39;re gonna counter what</text>
  <text start="211.82" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;ve been doing all along</text>
  <text start="213.11" dur="6.51">no not really at this time but what</text>
  <text start="216.35" dur="6.03">we&amp;#39;re seeing we are seeing now that the</text>
  <text start="219.62" dur="6.36">entire central bank system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="222.38" dur="5.85">imploding and of course Obama during his</text>
  <text start="225.98" dur="6">presidency they wanted us to get used to</text>
  <text start="228.23" dur="6.72">this new normal this 1% growth and get</text>
  <text start="231.98" dur="4.77">used to the way retail is get used to</text>
  <text start="234.95" dur="4.44">the way everything is because they were</text>
  <text start="236.75" dur="4.71">trying to convince us that the United</text>
  <text start="239.39" dur="4.41">States economy could never ever be great</text>
  <text start="241.46" dur="6.06">again because they were pushing us into</text>
  <text start="243.8" dur="6.09">a third world type of scenario but the</text>
  <text start="247.52" dur="4.89">central bank system has always been</text>
  <text start="249.89" dur="4.29">imploding way before Trump way before</text>
  <text start="252.41" dur="4.11">Obama because this is the way their</text>
  <text start="254.18" dur="6.39">system is designed it&amp;#39;s never meant to</text>
  <text start="256.52" dur="5.37">last past 45 to 50 years and now it is</text>
  <text start="260.57" dur="4.14">imploding not just here the United</text>
  <text start="261.89" dur="6.24">States but around the world if you look</text>
  <text start="264.71" dur="5.55">at credit you can see that they have to</text>
  <text start="268.13" dur="3.81">continually push credit on to the people</text>
  <text start="270.26" dur="4.2">this is how their system works this is</text>
  <text start="271.94" dur="5.82">why you see automobile loans student</text>
  <text start="274.46" dur="4.65">loans mortgages you name it it is out</text>
  <text start="277.76" dur="3.8">there and this is why people have to use</text>
  <text start="279.11" dur="5.7">credit cards but there&amp;#39;s a problem now</text>
  <text start="281.56" dur="7.66">things are going south very quickly and</text>
  <text start="284.81" dur="6.78">they needed to change the credit scores</text>
  <text start="289.22" dur="5.13">to allow more people to take out more</text>
  <text start="291.59" dur="4.14">credit to keep the system going so when</text>
  <text start="294.35" dur="3.039">we look at the first three months of</text>
  <text start="295.73" dur="4.719">2019</text>
  <text start="297.389" dur="5.131">we&amp;#39;re starting to see a troubling jump</text>
  <text start="300.449" dur="4.261">in the nationwide credit charge off and</text>
  <text start="302.52" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re seeing the default rate it is up</text>
  <text start="304.71" dur="4.109">around three point eight two percent the</text>
  <text start="306.15" dur="5.31">highest in seven years or since the</text>
  <text start="308.819" dur="5.82">second quarter of 2012 now at the same</text>
  <text start="311.46" dur="5.28">time the number of loans 30 days past</text>
  <text start="314.639" dur="5.791">due which is a leading indicator of</text>
  <text start="316.74" dur="8.34">future write-offs jumped at an all seven</text>
  <text start="320.43" dur="7.289">of the largest u.s. card issuers some</text>
  <text start="325.08" dur="5.04">examples Capital One said this week that</text>
  <text start="327.719" dur="4.531">its first quarter US car charge-off rate</text>
  <text start="330.12" dur="4.229">climbed to five point zero four percent</text>
  <text start="332.25" dur="4.02">from four point six four percent at the</text>
  <text start="334.349" dur="4.62">end of 2018 and Discover Financial</text>
  <text start="336.27" dur="4.59">Services which also reported results on</text>
  <text start="338.969" dur="3.991">Thursday the charger of rate rose around</text>
  <text start="340.86" dur="3.929">three point five percent from three</text>
  <text start="342.96" dur="5.069">point two three percent in the prior</text>
  <text start="344.789" dur="6">quarter as for what is causing this</text>
  <text start="348.029" dur="4.771">sharp jump in charge offs some credit</text>
  <text start="350.789" dur="6.09">card issuers blamed artificially</text>
  <text start="352.8" dur="6.69">increased FICO scores now remember they</text>
  <text start="356.879" dur="5.4">recalculated the FICO scores to give</text>
  <text start="359.49" dur="5.28">everyone a boost in their number so they</text>
  <text start="362.279" dur="5.161">can what get more credit cards go</text>
  <text start="364.77" dur="5.85">further into debt so if you look at the</text>
  <text start="367.44" dur="5.399">the customers who received a jump in</text>
  <text start="370.62" dur="5.31">their FICO scores which was many many</text>
  <text start="372.839" dur="5.341">people they&amp;#39;re actually riskier than</text>
  <text start="375.93" dur="5.01">their scores indicate there were around</text>
  <text start="378.18" dur="6">15 million more consumers with credit</text>
  <text start="380.94" dur="6.33">scores above 740 today than there were</text>
  <text start="384.18" dur="5.31">in 2006 and about 15 million fewer</text>
  <text start="387.27" dur="4.679">consumers with scores below 660</text>
  <text start="389.49" dur="4.139">according to Moody&amp;#39;s why did they do</text>
  <text start="391.949" dur="3.06">this they were trying to get people to</text>
  <text start="393.629" dur="3.51">go out and shop they were trying to get</text>
  <text start="395.009" dur="4.111">people out there to purchase autos</text>
  <text start="397.139" dur="4.2">because they wanted to keep their system</text>
  <text start="399.12" dur="4.079">going remember they proposed this law</text>
  <text start="401.339" dur="3.51">before Trump Trump came into office</text>
  <text start="403.199" dur="3.12">because they thought they were going to</text>
  <text start="404.849" dur="3.331">keep this thing going for a little bit</text>
  <text start="406.319" dur="3.481">longer have the event showing that</text>
  <text start="408.18" dur="3.63">everything was great look retails</text>
  <text start="409.8" dur="4.829">fantastic everything&amp;#39;s great and then we</text>
  <text start="411.81" dur="5.34">had an event but again things didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="414.629" dur="4.26">work out the way they planned now since</text>
  <text start="417.15" dur="4.019">the credit scores were recalculated</text>
  <text start="418.889" dur="4.221">those individuals that had negative</text>
  <text start="421.169" dur="5.461">scores are now seeing their problems</text>
  <text start="423.11" dur="5.77">disappear but these people are just as</text>
  <text start="426.63" dur="4.56">unlikely to repay their credit card bill</text>
  <text start="428.88" dur="4.44">whether their FICO score was 750 we</text>
  <text start="431.19" dur="5.13">680 just because you have a better</text>
  <text start="433.32" dur="4.47">number now the people there their train</text>
  <text start="436.32" dur="2.88">of thought and how much they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="437.79" dur="3.14">and what has been going on in their</text>
  <text start="439.2" dur="4.71">lives that hasn&amp;#39;t changed</text>
  <text start="440.93" dur="6.31">so since the scores have been changed</text>
  <text start="443.91" dur="5.43">these are our artificially inflated FICO</text>
  <text start="447.24" dur="4.38">scores and they represent an unreliable</text>
  <text start="449.34" dur="4.41">picture of customers ability or</text>
  <text start="451.62" dur="3.99">eagerness to pay down their credit card</text>
  <text start="453.75" dur="4.65">debt and this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="455.61" dur="4.32">charge-offs so with overall interest</text>
  <text start="458.4" dur="4.17">rates in the u.s. still near historic</text>
  <text start="459.93" dur="4.62">record loads the fact that charge-offs</text>
  <text start="462.57" dur="3.75">are already surging is just another</text>
  <text start="464.55" dur="6.93">reason why the Fed will find it</text>
  <text start="466.32" dur="7.05">impossible to hike rates in fact if the</text>
  <text start="471.48" dur="4.68">deteriorating default trend continues</text>
  <text start="473.37" dur="5.85">the central bank may have no choice but</text>
  <text start="476.16" dur="5.73">to cut rates so if you look you can see</text>
  <text start="479.22" dur="5.15">that for the everyday person it is</text>
  <text start="481.89" dur="4.86">getting worse and worse and the Fed</text>
  <text start="484.37" dur="3.76">they&amp;#39;re eventually gonna have to cut</text>
  <text start="486.75" dur="2.91">rates and I believe that Trump is gonna</text>
  <text start="488.13" dur="3.3">be out there because Larry Kudlow</text>
  <text start="489.66" dur="3.75">already said that he believes that the</text>
  <text start="491.43" dur="3.21">shed is gonna be cutting rates and I</text>
  <text start="493.41" dur="3.15">believe Trump is gonna be out there</text>
  <text start="494.64" dur="3.39">saying listen we should cut rates he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="496.56" dur="3.09">already started doing this with many of</text>
  <text start="498.03" dur="3.03">his tweets and I think this is going to</text>
  <text start="499.65" dur="3.45">continue and he needs to do this</text>
  <text start="501.06" dur="4.17">remember because the 2020 elections are</text>
  <text start="503.1" dur="4.14">coming up yes there&amp;#39;s gonna be so many</text>
  <text start="505.23" dur="3.15">different issues there&amp;#39;s gonna be so</text>
  <text start="507.24" dur="4.05">many other things that are going to be</text>
  <text start="508.38" dur="4.08">discussed but one thing that is equal</text>
  <text start="511.29" dur="3.6">among the people matter if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="512.46" dur="5.09">Republican Democrat no matter what race</text>
  <text start="514.89" dur="6.12">color creed doesn&amp;#39;t really matter</text>
  <text start="517.55" dur="4.6">everyone agrees that I don&amp;#39;t want anyone</text>
  <text start="521.01" dur="3.84">taking my money</text>
  <text start="522.15" dur="4.83">I want the economy to do fantastic I</text>
  <text start="524.85" dur="5.58">don&amp;#39;t want it to collapse I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="526.98" dur="6.96">to go bankrupt and everyone is always on</text>
  <text start="530.43" dur="6.96">the same page with this this is why</text>
  <text start="533.94" dur="4.17">Trump decided to push the economy to the</text>
  <text start="537.39" dur="2.73">extreme</text>
  <text start="538.11" dur="4.5">this way the mainstream media the deep</text>
  <text start="540.12" dur="4.53">state the central banks can&amp;#39;t use this</text>
  <text start="542.61" dur="4.62">against them because all he has to do is</text>
  <text start="544.65" dur="4.26">say listen do you like the economy the</text>
  <text start="547.23" dur="3.18">way it&amp;#39;s going it&amp;#39;s fantastic it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="548.91" dur="3.96">unbelievable look at the stock market</text>
  <text start="550.41" dur="3.96">look at the unemployment numbers look at</text>
  <text start="552.87" dur="2.82">the GDP numbers remember this is what</text>
  <text start="554.37" dur="3.09">the mainstream media the central banks</text>
  <text start="555.69" dur="3.69">have been using for a very long time to</text>
  <text start="557.46" dur="3.99">make the people convinced that the</text>
  <text start="559.38" dur="4.47">economy is doing well he&amp;#39;s using this</text>
  <text start="561.45" dur="3.63">weapon against them and one of the</text>
  <text start="563.85" dur="2.76">people gonna say no we don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="565.08" dur="3.45">this of course they&amp;#39;re gonna say we love</text>
  <text start="566.61" dur="4.08">it we want more of it</text>
  <text start="568.53" dur="4.53">and always to do is point to someone</text>
  <text start="570.69" dur="4.38">else who&amp;#39;s coming in and have it&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="587.01" dur="4.71">telling you it was going to be normal to</text>
  <text start="588.72" dur="7.23">be at 1% GDP so you see what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="591.72" dur="6.48">here and right after the 2020 elections</text>
  <text start="595.95" dur="4.65">that&amp;#39;s when everything is going to go</text>
  <text start="598.2" dur="3.93">full steam ahead and we see there are</text>
  <text start="600.6" dur="4.08">many countries out there like China</text>
  <text start="602.13" dur="5.58">Russia and now India where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="604.68" dur="6.21">really ramping up their gold purchases</text>
  <text start="607.71" dur="6.38">actually India they have added 1.5</text>
  <text start="610.89" dur="6.17">million ounces or 46.7 tons of gold and</text>
  <text start="614.09" dur="5.8">they&amp;#39;ve added it to their stockpile why</text>
  <text start="617.06" dur="4.95">because it looks like they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="619.89" dur="5.97">propose making gold a mandatory</text>
  <text start="622.01" dur="7">financial asset and we can see that</text>
  <text start="625.86" dur="4.23">things are really changing with all the</text>
  <text start="629.01" dur="4.32">countries that are out there because</text>
  <text start="630.09" dur="7.8">they realize very soon there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="633.33" dur="6.81">be a very big change they know that the</text>
  <text start="637.89" dur="4.67">dollar the Federal Reserve Note cannot</text>
  <text start="640.14" dur="5.94">stay the reserve currency forever</text>
  <text start="642.56" dur="6.1">history always proves that the central</text>
  <text start="646.08" dur="4.38">bank&amp;#39;s currency system always fails and</text>
  <text start="648.66" dur="3.72">it has to switch to someplace else but</text>
  <text start="650.46" dur="4.47">this time it&amp;#39;s going to be very very</text>
  <text start="652.38" dur="5.07">different now very interestingly coming</text>
  <text start="654.93" dur="4.2">out of the Heritage Foundation they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="657.45" dur="4.41">talking about the Federal Reserve and</text>
  <text start="659.13" dur="5.22">their dual mandate and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="661.86" dur="5.52">that Congress can improve the nation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="664.35" dur="6.18">monetary policy by replacing the feds</text>
  <text start="667.38" dur="5.4">so-called dual mandate and we know what</text>
  <text start="670.53" dur="4.97">this mandated this is you know price</text>
  <text start="672.78" dur="5.73">stability which means no inflation and</text>
  <text start="675.5" dur="5.41">maximum employment and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="678.51" dur="5.64">that Congress should give the Fed a</text>
  <text start="680.91" dur="6.3">single mandate of achieving monetary</text>
  <text start="684.15" dur="5.61">neutrality by stabilizing overall</text>
  <text start="687.21" dur="5.76">spending in the economy what does this</text>
  <text start="689.76" dur="5.04">mean it means supplying the amount of</text>
  <text start="692.97" dur="3.049">money the economy needs to keep moving</text>
  <text start="694.8" dur="4.399">No</text>
  <text start="696.019" dur="4.591">more and no less well isn&amp;#39;t that what</text>
  <text start="699.199" dur="4.341">the gold standard did</text>
  <text start="700.61" dur="5.849">isn&amp;#39;t that what checks and balances do</text>
  <text start="703.54" dur="5.68">because the federal reserve system is to</text>
  <text start="706.459" dur="5.761">create as much currency as the</text>
  <text start="709.22" dur="5.159">government wants I mean this is how the</text>
  <text start="712.22" dur="5.13">whole thing is designed and they like it</text>
  <text start="714.379" dur="4.74">this way now they&amp;#39;re saying there should</text>
  <text start="717.35" dur="4.529">be one mandate which is a restructure of</text>
  <text start="719.119" dur="5.22">the Fed and Congress can do this this is</text>
  <text start="721.879" dur="5.13">the beginning stages to say okay now</text>
  <text start="724.339" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;re only going to create the currency</text>
  <text start="727.009" dur="6.36">that we actually need we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="729.739" dur="7.111">borrow any more for other things only to</text>
  <text start="733.369" dur="7.47">keep the things going now this is the</text>
  <text start="736.85" dur="7.079">beginning stages this will help bring in</text>
  <text start="740.839" dur="4.71">maybe the gold standard or something</text>
  <text start="743.929" dur="3.69">else where we have checks and balances</text>
  <text start="745.549" dur="3.15">it looks like they&amp;#39;re gonna start doing</text>
  <text start="747.619" dur="4.08">this in steps</text>
  <text start="748.699" dur="5.911">now remember Trump has already exerted</text>
  <text start="751.699" dur="4.411">more influence over one institution than</text>
  <text start="754.61" dur="4.86">any other president in a hundred years</text>
  <text start="756.11" dur="5.639">that is the Federal Reserve that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="759.47" dur="4.32">because Trump has had more control over</text>
  <text start="761.749" dur="4.83">the Fed personnel than any other</text>
  <text start="763.79" dur="6.659">president since the Fed was founded in</text>
  <text start="766.579" dur="5.911">1913 when Trump was sworn in he</text>
  <text start="770.449" dur="5.61">inherited two vacant seats on the</text>
  <text start="772.49" dur="5.67">seven-person Board of Governors Obama</text>
  <text start="776.059" dur="3.69">also had the same vacancies but he</text>
  <text start="778.16" dur="3.81">didn&amp;#39;t nominate anyone to fill the seats</text>
  <text start="779.749" dur="5.76">he was afraid that anyone that he chose</text>
  <text start="781.97" dur="6.179">that they wouldn&amp;#39;t be approved or did he</text>
  <text start="785.509" dur="4.101">really liked the way it was I believe</text>
  <text start="788.149" dur="4.591">that&amp;#39;s what he liked</text>
  <text start="789.61" dur="5.74">but Trump all of a sudden got another</text>
  <text start="792.74" dur="6.779">windfall within 14 months of becoming</text>
  <text start="795.35" dur="8.37">president three additional Fed governors</text>
  <text start="799.519" dur="7.711">resigned coincidence I think not Dan</text>
  <text start="803.72" dur="6.299">carullo Stan Fischer and Janet Yellen</text>
  <text start="807.23" dur="8.639">and Trump suddenly had five vacancies to</text>
  <text start="810.019" dur="8.49">fill or 70% of the entire Fed now we</text>
  <text start="815.869" dur="6.09">know that Kaine is no longer in the</text>
  <text start="818.509" dur="5.43">running but it looks like there might be</text>
  <text start="821.959" dur="5.31">some indication that Trump&amp;#39;s next</text>
  <text start="823.939" dur="4.711">nominee will be Judy Shelton so who is</text>
  <text start="827.269" dur="4.531">Judy Shelton</text>
  <text start="828.65" dur="6.57">she is an economic advisor to Trump and</text>
