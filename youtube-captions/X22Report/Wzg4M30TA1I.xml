  <text start="109.909" dur="4.83">closer and closer to Friday and I still</text>
  <text start="111.86" dur="5.159">believe when we look at the situation</text>
  <text start="114.739" dur="6.421">right now and what they&amp;#39;ve been doing it</text>
  <text start="117.019" dur="7.83">does appear that they are going to push</text>
  <text start="121.16" dur="5.76">the Dow up over 20,000 points when we</text>
  <text start="124.849" dur="5.011">hit Friday now of course this is not a</text>
  <text start="126.92" dur="4.26">sure thing but when we get into their</text>
  <text start="129.86" dur="4.08">heads and what they&amp;#39;re thinking what</text>
  <text start="131.18" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re trying to do they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="133.94" dur="5.519">make everyone believe that the year of</text>
  <text start="135.44" dur="6.269">2016 and the eight years that Obama has</text>
  <text start="139.459" dur="5.461">been in office the economy has been</text>
  <text start="141.709" dur="5.911">incredible and to finish this off what</text>
  <text start="144.92" dur="5.819">they need is the Dow at 20,000 points</text>
  <text start="147.62" dur="5.699">and we can see we&amp;#39;re at like 1950</text>
  <text start="150.739" dur="5.791">nineteen you know nineteen thousand five</text>
  <text start="153.319" dur="4.89">hundred and forty I should say 19550 and</text>
  <text start="156.53" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s bobbing up and down and what we</text>
  <text start="158.209" dur="5.64">really need is 40 to 50 points and that</text>
  <text start="161.36" dur="3.659">is very easy for the plunge Protection</text>
  <text start="163.849" dur="4.11">Team to do and the high-frequency</text>
  <text start="165.019" dur="7.5">traders to push this over the edge here</text>
  <text start="167.959" dur="7.92">and I do still suspect that they will do</text>
  <text start="172.519" dur="6.241">this on Friday we will see doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="175.879" dur="6.211">them right here but it does seem that</text>
  <text start="178.76" dur="7.41">this is the direction we&amp;#39;re going in</text>
  <text start="182.09" dur="6.42">now we know that the you Mitch last time</text>
  <text start="186.17" dur="5.16">we reported well it hit all time new</text>
  <text start="188.51" dur="6.39">highs it surged everyone has hope and</text>
  <text start="191.33" dur="6.39">now we see the conference board is doing</text>
  <text start="194.9" dur="5.49">the same exact thing where it is surged</text>
  <text start="197.72" dur="4.14">in November from about a hundred and</text>
  <text start="200.39" dur="4.14">nine all the way up to about a hundred</text>
  <text start="201.86" dur="5.25">and thirteen point seven and we can see</text>
  <text start="204.53" dur="6.06">this is all following the same path here</text>
  <text start="207.11" dur="5.459">where everyone believes in the illusion</text>
  <text start="210.59" dur="4.14">that everything is great now remember</text>
  <text start="212.569" dur="3.331">the conference board they receive grants</text>
  <text start="214.73" dur="3.509">from the government they&amp;#39;re under the</text>
  <text start="215.9" dur="3.6">total control of the government and they</text>
  <text start="218.239" dur="3.361">pretty much do whatever the government</text>
  <text start="219.5" dur="4.549">wants them to do and whatever they want</text>
  <text start="221.6" dur="5.49">them to report that&amp;#39;s what they do and</text>
  <text start="224.049" dur="5.921">we can see that they are now covering</text>
  <text start="227.09" dur="5.25">all bases stock market all time new</text>
  <text start="229.97" dur="5.43">highs unemployment down to four point</text>
  <text start="232.34" dur="5.85">six percent GDP revised to three point</text>
  <text start="235.4" dur="4.73">five percent real estate they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="238.19" dur="4.409">to convince us that existing home sales</text>
  <text start="240.13" dur="4.66">new home sales with mortgage</text>
  <text start="242.599" dur="4.771">applications declining mortgage rates</text>
  <text start="244.79" dur="5.819">increasing well they broke all records</text>
  <text start="247.37" dur="5.67">and here we are with Case Shiller now</text>
  <text start="250.609" dur="5.551">talking about the national home price a</text>
  <text start="253.04" dur="7.05">price index saying that according to</text>
  <text start="256.16" dur="6.9">October&amp;#39;s Case Shiller data that us home</text>
  <text start="260.09" dur="7.74">prices have never been higher since July</text>
  <text start="263.06" dur="6.69">of 2006 peak now again we have to look</text>
  <text start="267.83" dur="3.51">at what&amp;#39;s been going on here and if we</text>
  <text start="269.75" dur="4.95">look at case-shiller home price year</text>
  <text start="271.34" dur="5.04">over year we see that it really hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="274.7" dur="5.82">gone anywhere it&amp;#39;s been pretty much</text>
  <text start="276.38" dur="6.599">flatlined and actually the prices have</text>
  <text start="280.52" dur="6.019">come down if you really look at this</text>
  <text start="282.979" dur="7.471">since the height of the market back in</text>
  <text start="286.539" dur="8.801">2006 we hit the height of the market in</text>
  <text start="290.45" dur="8.3">2013 and it dropped in 2014 and we have</text>
  <text start="295.34" dur="5.88">been steadily on a level playing field</text>
  <text start="298.75" dur="4.72">which means we&amp;#39;re getting ready to drop</text>
  <text start="301.22" dur="4.23">once again but of course they need to</text>
  <text start="303.47" dur="4.08">play they need to play this all up make</text>
  <text start="305.45" dur="4.35">it look like the economy is doing much</text>
  <text start="307.55" dur="6.03">much better than it really is and we</text>
  <text start="309.8" dur="6.71">could see why they&amp;#39;re doing this and one</text>
  <text start="313.58" dur="7.77">of the reasons is Obama wants to leave</text>
  <text start="316.51" dur="8.79">office with the economy looking like it</text>
  <text start="321.35" dur="6.57">has completely recovered it has</text>
  <text start="325.3" dur="7.78">recovered completely and it&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="327.92" dur="7.59">improved compared to 2008 and we know</text>
  <text start="333.08" dur="3.81">this is one gigantic illusion because</text>
  <text start="335.51" dur="4.34">remember when the market came down in</text>
  <text start="336.89" dur="6.06">2008 the stock market was only at 14,000</text>
  <text start="339.85" dur="8.98">now when he&amp;#39;s leaving office it will be</text>
  <text start="342.95" dur="7.26">at 20,000 but we know that all of this</text>
  <text start="348.83" dur="4.11">because we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the hard</text>
  <text start="350.21" dur="6.18">data the economic information and this</text>
  <text start="352.94" dur="5.49">reminds me of 2008 with the subprime</text>
  <text start="356.39" dur="3.81">securities when everyone was believing</text>
  <text start="358.43" dur="4.53">that real estate was going to</text>
  <text start="360.2" dur="5.22">continually move up the stock market was</text>
  <text start="362.96" dur="5.28">going to continually move up that this</text>
  <text start="365.42" dur="5.07">party could never end and there were a</text>
  <text start="368.24" dur="3.99">few individuals looking into the</text>
  <text start="370.49" dur="4.86">subprime security saying there is</text>
  <text start="372.23" dur="5.1">something very wrong here and you know</text>
  <text start="375.35" dur="4.98">they discovered this back in like</text>
  <text start="377.33" dur="4.41">something like 2006 2007 and each year</text>
  <text start="380.33" dur="4.2">that went by they couldn&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="381.74" dur="5.97">why the economy was still where it was</text>
  <text start="384.53" dur="5.52">why didn&amp;#39;t it collapse yet well this is</text>
  <text start="387.71" dur="3.99">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now because when</text>
  <text start="390.05" dur="4.26">we have been looking at all the</text>
  <text start="391.7" dur="5.49">underlying data we see that the economy</text>
  <text start="394.31" dur="4.95">is flashing collapse we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="397.19" dur="4.53">recession right now it is flashing</text>
  <text start="399.26" dur="5.79">collapse right in front of our eyes</text>
  <text start="401.72" dur="5.01">we see out in Europe well the ECB is</text>
  <text start="405.05" dur="4.08">going to be lowing Deutsche&amp;#39;s bank</text>
  <text start="406.73" dur="4.62">capital requirements well because they</text>
  <text start="409.13" dur="4.14">need to pay bonuses so they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="411.35" dur="4.17">okay you know what don&amp;#39;t put as much</text>
  <text start="413.27" dur="4.5">into capital requirements don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="5.07">about that will lower your level this</text>
  <text start="417.77" dur="5.91">way you can hand out the bonuses we see</text>
  <text start="420.59" dur="6.3">people are taking their funds out of the</text>
  <text start="423.68" dur="5.7">banks in Italy Monti DePauw she well</text>
  <text start="426.89" dur="5.37">they have capital shortfalls right now</text>
  <text start="429.38" dur="5.43">and it looks a lot worse than it did</text>
  <text start="432.26" dur="4.98">just a couple of days ago they need to</text>
  <text start="434.81" dur="7.17">plug a capital shortfall of about 8.8</text>
  <text start="437.24" dur="8.61">billion euros 76% greater than the</text>
  <text start="441.98" dur="7.17">previous 5 billion euro gap estimated by</text>
  <text start="445.85" dur="4.02">the bank and we see already that things</text>
  <text start="449.15" dur="3.39">are</text>
  <text start="449.87" dur="6.12">getting worse and worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="452.54" dur="5.909">and things are starting to break down we</text>
  <text start="455.99" dur="4.82">see the US Department of Energy well</text>
  <text start="458.449" dur="5.341">they&amp;#39;re looking to sell off some of its</text>
  <text start="460.81" dur="6.97">Strategic Petroleum Reserve as soon as</text>
  <text start="463.79" dur="6.629">January and Congress has authorized the</text>
  <text start="467.78" dur="6.09">Department of Energy to sell about 375</text>
  <text start="470.419" dur="6.361">point four million worth of oil in its</text>
  <text start="473.87" dur="6.93">recent budget resolution and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="476.78" dur="8.43">saying that the sale of the oil well</text>
  <text start="480.8" dur="9.48">that is going to help improve the</text>
  <text start="485.21" dur="8.76">storage facilities and we see right now</text>
  <text start="490.28" dur="7.23">that these reserves well they&amp;#39;re held in</text>
  <text start="493.97" dur="5.49">salt caverns in Louisiana and Texas they</text>
  <text start="497.51" dur="5.04">were set up decades ago in the aftermath</text>
  <text start="499.46" dur="5.25">of the Arab oil embargo in 1973 which</text>
  <text start="502.55" dur="5.13">really means that&amp;#39;s when the United</text>
  <text start="504.71" dur="5.45">States was pushing the petro dollar on</text>
  <text start="507.68" dur="5.19">to all these middle eastern states and</text>
  <text start="510.16" dur="5.86">they were adjusting everything as we</text>
  <text start="512.87" dur="5.339">came off the gold standard the SPR</text>
  <text start="516.02" dur="4.35">system can hold more than 700 million</text>
  <text start="518.209" dur="5.281">barrels of oil this is the largest</text>
  <text start="520.37" dur="6.54">strategic stockpile in the world and the</text>
  <text start="523.49" dur="6.48">question is is that really to make</text>
  <text start="526.91" dur="4.92">improvements of the storage area or does</text>
  <text start="529.97" dur="5.46">the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="531.83" dur="7.379">actually need the funds because as we</text>
  <text start="535.43" dur="5.849">can see with facta Gatka and what is</text>
  <text start="539.209" dur="4.021">happening here in the united states they</text>
  <text start="541.279" dur="3.511">don&amp;#39;t have enough revenue being brought</text>
  <text start="543.23" dur="3.39">into the government to pay for this debt</text>
  <text start="544.79" dur="5.34">and if isn&amp;#39;t just rates are moving up</text>
  <text start="546.62" dur="6.36">this is going to be a huge problem the</text>
  <text start="550.13" dur="5.67">Fed admits that the good old days well</text>
  <text start="552.98" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re never coming back where we saw 5</text>
  <text start="555.8" dur="5.82">6 7 8 percent interest rates right now</text>
  <text start="558.98" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re saying well we&amp;#39;re not seeing</text>
  <text start="561.62" dur="3.839">this we&amp;#39;re not going to be returning to</text>
  <text start="563" dur="4.77">normalcy any time in the future and we</text>
  <text start="565.459" dur="4.741">know that the Fed was never gonna bring</text>
  <text start="567.77" dur="5.25">the interest rates up that high they</text>
  <text start="570.2" dur="5.13">might go that high on their own as the</text>
  <text start="573.02" dur="4.62">Fed loses control but we can see that</text>
  <text start="575.33" dur="4.95">the Fed raising the interest rates by 25</text>
  <text start="577.64" dur="5.13">basis point that was the signal that</text>
  <text start="580.28" dur="3.419">this economy is ready to be brought down</text>
  <text start="582.77" dur="2.969">because they</text>
  <text start="583.699" dur="6.57">let the interest rates move up it would</text>
  <text start="585.739" dur="5.97">be a complete disaster the debt the US</text>
  <text start="590.269" dur="3.99">government would not be able to service</text>
  <text start="591.709" dur="4.92">it the housing industry would come to a</text>
  <text start="594.259" dur="6.51">screeching halt and we would have major</text>
  <text start="596.629" dur="5.61">problems so to me it really makes no</text>
  <text start="600.769" dur="4.021">difference at this point because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="602.239" dur="4.83">headed towards a collapse scenario and</text>
  <text start="604.79" dur="6.5">they know this they know there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="607.069" dur="6.151">other place to go we see out in Europe</text>
  <text start="611.29" dur="5.819">where it all started where they were</text>
  <text start="613.22" dur="7.88">gonna ban cash we saw it in India we saw</text>
  <text start="617.109" dur="6.46">them talking about getting rid of cash</text>
  <text start="621.1" dur="5.259">getting rid of the five hundred euro</text>
  <text start="623.569" dur="5.19">note and now the European Commission</text>
  <text start="626.359" dur="7.13">well they&amp;#39;re proposing tightening</text>
  <text start="628.759" dur="8.49">controls on cash and precious metals</text>
  <text start="633.489" dur="6.94">that are transferred outside of the you</text>
  <text start="637.249" dur="5.88">under the guise of shutting down one</text>

  <text start="643.129" dur="5.341">the continent after the Berlin Christmas</text>
  <text start="646.939" dur="6.21">attack which is a complete false flag</text>
  <text start="648.47" dur="7.769">the EU is using the idea that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="653.149" dur="5.011">going to go after terrorist financing</text>
  <text start="656.239" dur="4.171">they&amp;#39;re gonna be going after prepaid</text>

  <text start="662.689" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re gonna be going after Bitcoin and</text>
  <text start="664.989" dur="5.14">part of it is those people who are</text>
  <text start="667.879" dur="5.01">carrying more than ten thousand euros in</text>
  <text start="670.129" dur="5.281">cash that while they already have to</text>
  <text start="672.889" dur="5.13">declare this at customs when entering</text>
  <text start="675.41" dur="4.349">the EU the new rules would allow</text>
  <text start="678.019" dur="4.32">authorities to seize money below that</text>
  <text start="679.759" dur="6.151">threshold where there are suspicions of</text>
  <text start="682.339" dur="5.67">criminal activity the Commission is also</text>
  <text start="685.91" dur="4.44">considering whether set up EU focused</text>
