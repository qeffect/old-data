  <text start="133.78" dur="4.08">continually deteriorating we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="135.739" dur="5.28">talking about this for quite a while and</text>
  <text start="137.86" dur="5.59">the people are looking at the situation</text>
  <text start="141.019" dur="5.31">and they&amp;#39;re realizing something&amp;#39;s wrong</text>
  <text start="143.45" dur="5.21">because we&amp;#39;re hearing more companies</text>
  <text start="146.329" dur="5.91">we&amp;#39;re hearing them lay off more people</text>
  <text start="148.66" dur="6.76">not a hundred not 200 but in the</text>
  <text start="152.239" dur="6.571">thousands and we can see banking systems</text>
  <text start="155.42" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re starting to fall apart and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="158.81" dur="6.69">starting to realize that everything is</text>
  <text start="160.91" dur="6.389">starting to deteriorate implode we see</text>
  <text start="165.5" dur="4.17">consumer confidence right now it is</text>
  <text start="167.299" dur="7.201">crashed to a two-year low and of course</text>
  <text start="169.67" dur="6.569">they&amp;#39;re blaming the elections but when</text>
  <text start="174.5" dur="4.41">we look at this we see that the stock</text>
  <text start="176.239" dur="4.351">market is at record highs gas prices</text>
  <text start="178.91" dur="4.439">there at record lows</text>
  <text start="180.59" dur="4.679">yes they moved up a little bit we see</text>
  <text start="183.349" dur="3.301">the Fed is continually telling us that</text>
  <text start="185.269" dur="3.031">we&amp;#39;re in this incredible recovery</text>
  <text start="186.65" dur="6.33">they&amp;#39;re going to be raising the interest</text>
  <text start="188.3" dur="6.75">rate interest rates anytime soon we see</text>
  <text start="192.98" dur="4.819">that Obama is out there telling us that</text>
  <text start="195.05" dur="6.24">the economy is absolutely fine</text>
  <text start="197.799" dur="7.091">everything is awesome but we see that</text>
  <text start="201.29" dur="9.02">consumer confidence is declining right</text>
  <text start="204.89" dur="8.069">now and the entire sentiment index</text>
  <text start="210.31" dur="5.35">slipped in early October to its lowest</text>
  <text start="212.959" dur="4.681">level since last September and the</text>
  <text start="215.66" dur="6.51">second lowest level in the past two</text>
  <text start="217.64" dur="6.87">years perhaps the most concerning figure</text>
  <text start="222.17" dur="5.099">was a decline in the expectations index</text>
  <text start="224.51" dur="9.089">which fell to its lowest level in the</text>
  <text start="227.269" dur="11.791">past two years and this is due to d2 the</text>
  <text start="233.599" dur="9.061">declining incomes in households where we</text>
  <text start="239.06" dur="4.95">have households of those people making</text>
  <text start="242.66" dur="5.25">seventy-five thousand dollars or less</text>
  <text start="244.01" dur="6.42">and they&amp;#39;re looking at the situation the</text>
  <text start="247.91" dur="6">economy and saying something&amp;#39;s wrong</text>
  <text start="250.43" dur="7.589">here something&amp;#39;s not right I don&amp;#39;t feel</text>
  <text start="253.91" dur="7.319">confident anymore because when we look</text>
  <text start="258.019" dur="6.241">around we see that corporations they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="261.229" dur="4.531">continually laying off people HP is</text>
  <text start="264.26" dur="4.71">going to be cutting about three to four</text>
  <text start="265.76" dur="8.07">thousand jobs fujitsu is going to be</text>
  <text start="268.97" dur="7.11">laying off 1800 people and we see retail</text>
  <text start="273.83" dur="4.35">sales now the corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="276.08" dur="4.83">there and they&amp;#39;re trying to make the</text>
  <text start="278.18" dur="7.13">case that retail sales are amazing</text>
  <text start="280.91" dur="8.22">they&amp;#39;re up by 0.6% and everything is</text>
  <text start="285.31" dur="8.609">absolutely fine when we look at these</text>
  <text start="289.13" dur="8.13">numbers we see that the reason why</text>
  <text start="293.919" dur="6.97">retail has increased it&amp;#39;s because fuel</text>
  <text start="297.26" dur="8.339">prices have gone up and actually when</text>
  <text start="300.889" dur="7.59">you look at retail sales the slow retail</text>
  <text start="305.599" dur="6.601">growth that we&amp;#39;re seeing right now has</text>
  <text start="308.479" dur="6.421">led to recessions</text>
  <text start="312.2" dur="5.06">and when we look at the retail numbers</text>
  <text start="314.9" dur="7.53">and we looked out look at the breakdown</text>
  <text start="317.26" dur="8.95">we see gas stations well that pushed the</text>
  <text start="322.43" dur="6.96">percentage up but when we look at sales</text>
  <text start="326.21" dur="5.82">in stores like electronics and</text>
  <text start="329.39" dur="5.04">appliances that is down negative point</text>
  <text start="332.03" dur="6.33">nine percent health and personal care</text>
  <text start="334.43" dur="6.84">stores they&amp;#39;re down- 0.5% general</text>
  <text start="338.36" dur="5.58">merchandise stores down negative 0.4%</text>
  <text start="341.27" dur="5.49">department stores down negative point</text>
  <text start="343.94" dur="5.1">seven percent and of course as we know</text>
  <text start="346.76" dur="5.67">we&amp;#39;re coming into the holiday season and</text>
  <text start="349.04" dur="4.59">we know that sales are going to pick up</text>
  <text start="352.43" dur="3.38">a little bit because people going to be</text>
  <text start="353.63" dur="6.18">buying gifts Thanksgiving is coming</text>
  <text start="355.81" dur="8.61">halloween is on its way but when we look</text>
  <text start="359.81" dur="8.46">at retail sales we see that sales are</text>
  <text start="364.42" dur="8.08">continually declining and the trend is</text>
  <text start="368.27" dur="7.29">down not up and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="372.5" dur="7.5">problem going forward we see in the auto</text>
  <text start="375.56" dur="7.95">loan industry that sales of automobiles</text>
  <text start="380" dur="6.63">in the u.s. well they bubbled over in</text>
  <text start="383.51" dur="6.42">recent years and we see that the</text>
  <text start="386.63" dur="5.69">seasonally adjusted annual rate of 17.7</text>
  <text start="389.93" dur="5.85">million units at the end of September is</text>
  <text start="392.32" dur="7.75">quite a bit actually to put that number</text>
  <text start="395.78" dur="7.14">in context a 15-year useful life when</text>
  <text start="400.07" dur="5.52">applied that&amp;#39;s more than one car for</text>
  <text start="402.92" dur="4.83">every driving age person in the United</text>
  <text start="405.59" dur="4.47">States obviously that&amp;#39;s likely not</text>
  <text start="407.75" dur="4.62">sustainable which is probably why Ford</text>
  <text start="410.06" dur="4.17">executives admitted on recent conference</text>
  <text start="412.37" dur="5.19">call that US auto sales have likely</text>
  <text start="414.23" dur="7.55">reached a plateau and we can see right</text>
  <text start="417.56" dur="7.77">now that those subprime borrowers who</text>
  <text start="421.78" dur="6.43">purchased a car took out a loan well</text>
  <text start="425.33" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re having problems SP is reporting</text>
  <text start="428.21" dur="5.13">that those people that are more than 60</text>
  <text start="430.88" dur="5.67">days on about a four point eight five</text>
  <text start="433.34" dur="6.21">percent of auto loans in August they are</text>
  <text start="436.55" dur="6.03">delinquent and it&amp;#39;s the highest level</text>
  <text start="439.55" dur="6.03">since January of 2010 we see rising</text>
  <text start="442.58" dur="3.74">delinquencies are readily apparent in GM</text>
  <text start="445.58" dur="4.23">subprime</text>
  <text start="446.32" dur="4.99">securitization where 31 to 60 one day</text>
  <text start="449.81" dur="5.4">delinquencies have been on the rise</text>
  <text start="451.31" dur="7.62">since 2012 we see year-over-year change</text>
  <text start="455.21" dur="8.24">in 61 plus de delinquencies for GM they</text>
  <text start="458.93" dur="6.9">have been growing and they&amp;#39;ve hit</text>
  <text start="463.45" dur="6.73">double-digit rates for several months</text>
  <text start="465.83" dur="6.95">now so what we&amp;#39;re seeing is we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="470.18" dur="5.85">the bubbles they&amp;#39;ve been blown up</text>
  <text start="472.78" dur="5.95">they&amp;#39;re very big they&amp;#39;re getting ready</text>
  <text start="476.03" dur="4.74">to pop and we&amp;#39;re seeing it in the auto</text>
  <text start="478.73" dur="4.41">loan industry we&amp;#39;re seeing in the</text>
  <text start="480.77" dur="5.01">housing market we&amp;#39;re seeing in the stock</text>
  <text start="483.14" dur="5.1">market we&amp;#39;re seeing it in the bond</text>
  <text start="485.78" dur="6.78">market the derivatives market it is all</text>
  <text start="488.24" dur="7.97">coming down very very quickly now we</text>
  <text start="492.56" dur="8.82">know they continually forecast the GDP</text>
  <text start="496.21" dur="8.14">numbers to us the GDP now model lets us</text>
  <text start="501.38" dur="4.47">know how the country is doing and of</text>
  <text start="504.35" dur="3.06">course they start very high all the time</text>
  <text start="505.85" dur="4.02">three percent three-point-five percent</text>
  <text start="507.41" dur="4.68">then in revised it down they revised it</text>
  <text start="509.87" dur="5.1">down and if we look we can see this is</text>
  <text start="512.09" dur="4.98">what they&amp;#39;ve been doing in 2016 we see</text>
  <text start="514.97" dur="3.69">that every single quarter they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="517.07" dur="3.81">revising the numbers down further and</text>
  <text start="518.66" dur="4.95">further and further and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="520.88" dur="5.43">seeing right now is that when we add all</text>
  <text start="523.61" dur="5.57">of this up with all the new revisions</text>
  <text start="526.31" dur="7.77">and everything like that at this point</text>
  <text start="529.18" dur="9.13">the economy will grow at a rate of one</text>
  <text start="534.08" dur="7.92">point four percent in 2016 and this is</text>
  <text start="538.31" dur="6.26">the manipulated number think about this</text>
  <text start="542" dur="6.51">for a second everything they&amp;#39;ve done to</text>
  <text start="544.57" dur="6.82">create this GDP number is been</text>
  <text start="548.51" dur="4.95">manipulated take away the manipulation</text>
  <text start="551.39" dur="7.32">this number is completely negative at</text>
  <text start="553.46" dur="7.71">this point so we&amp;#39;re in a situation where</text>
  <text start="558.71" dur="4.89">the economy is continually declining no</text>
  <text start="561.17" dur="4.98">stopping at whatsoever Manufacturing has</text>
  <text start="563.6" dur="4.32">left the country what&amp;#39;s keeping up</text>
  <text start="566.15" dur="6.06">what&amp;#39;s keeping the GDP and the positive</text>
  <text start="567.92" dur="7.05">range will Obamacare and we see right</text>
  <text start="572.21" dur="4.74">now that the u.s. government the central</text>
  <text start="574.97" dur="4.679">bankers they have been writing</text>
  <text start="576.95" dur="5.04">legislation throughout the years</text>
  <text start="579.649" dur="4.531">and of course what they do is they say</text>
  <text start="581.99" dur="4.409">okay you know what let&amp;#39;s create some</text>
  <text start="584.18" dur="4.56">legislation where you know people have</text>
  <text start="586.399" dur="5.61">to buy Treasury bonds but that won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="588.74" dur="6.12">come due until maybe 2016 let&amp;#39;s create</text>
  <text start="592.009" dur="4.86">legislation in 2014 and that won&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="594.86" dur="7.38">true until 2016 so people really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="596.869" dur="9.931">care and way back in 2014 they decided</text>
  <text start="602.24" dur="8.699">that they&amp;#39;re going to create a new role</text>
  <text start="606.8" dur="7.31">the SEC is to a seven which is a money</text>
  <text start="610.939" dur="7.26">fund reform which was adopted in 2014</text>
  <text start="614.11" dur="7.87">where it says the prime money market</text>
  <text start="618.199" dur="6.24">mutual funds those that invest in non</text>
  <text start="621.98" dur="6.979">government issued assets such as</text>
  <text start="624.439" dur="11.101">short-term corporate municipal debt well</text>
  <text start="628.959" dur="13.961">they will not be able to withdraw any of</text>
  <text start="635.54" dur="10.489">it if there is an economic crisis now</text>
  <text start="642.92" dur="7.079">the rule was created to prevent chaos</text>
  <text start="646.029" dur="6.25">during the Lehman Brothers crisis where</text>
  <text start="649.999" dur="6">they went bankrupt in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="652.279" dur="8.75">and the other reason they did this was</text>
  <text start="655.999" dur="7.56">to force everyone into Treasury bonds</text>
  <text start="661.029" dur="5.61">because what they wanted everyone to do</text>
  <text start="663.559" dur="7.97">was take your prime money market funds</text>
  <text start="666.639" dur="8.95">convert them into government funds and</text>
  <text start="671.529" dur="5.92">that would be Treasuries because we know</text>
  <text start="675.589" dur="4.381">we have a problem because countries are</text>
  <text start="677.449" dur="5.94">dumping Treasury bonds they needed</text>
  <text start="679.97" dur="6.329">someone to pick up the slack so over</text>
  <text start="683.389" dur="5.55">this time period since 2014 many of the</text>
  <text start="686.299" dur="6.84">prime money market funds have been</text>
  <text start="688.939" dur="8.49">converting out of municipal debt short</text>
  <text start="693.139" dur="7.92">term corporate debt into government debt</text>
  <text start="697.429" dur="6.561">and then they wouldn&amp;#39;t be hit if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="701.059" dur="6.84">an economic crisis they would be able to</text>
  <text start="703.99" dur="5.949">get their funds well realistically will</text>
  <text start="707.899" dur="4.141">they be able to get their funds most</text>
  <text start="709.939" dur="3.27">likely not because the government will</text>
  <text start="712.04" dur="3.659">come up with some time</text>
  <text start="713.209" dur="6.24">a reason why at this point you just</text>
  <text start="715.699" dur="6.541">cannot get it because if this system is</text>
  <text start="719.449" dur="6.48">coming down and crashing how in the</text>
  <text start="722.24" dur="6.689">world is the government going to say</text>
  <text start="725.929" dur="6.541">okay we can now pay out and give</text>
  <text start="728.929" dur="6.57">everyone their currency because you know</text>
  <text start="732.47" dur="5.13">countries around the world they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="735.499" dur="5.721">to be saying okay you know something we</text>
  <text start="737.6" dur="6.049">want our currency for the Treasury bonds</text>
  <text start="741.22" dur="4.57">investors are going to say this and</text>
  <text start="743.649" dur="3.79">everyone is going to hit at the same</text>
  <text start="745.79" dur="3.18">time when this whole entire system comes</text>
  <text start="747.439" dur="5.57">crashing down because this is what</text>
  <text start="748.97" dur="7.5">normally happens people want their money</text>
  <text start="753.009" dur="6.461">and of course the value of this money is</text>
  <text start="756.47" dur="6">going to continually decline now we see</text>
  <text start="759.47" dur="5.909">Deutsche Bank well they&amp;#39;re in big</text>
  <text start="762.47" dur="4.289">trouble as we know and just the other</text>
  <text start="765.379" dur="3.541">day they said the RAM we&amp;#39;re going to cut</text>
  <text start="766.759" dur="5.76">about a thousand jobs well now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="768.92" dur="5.519">up to 10,000 and you have to remember</text>
  <text start="772.519" dur="4.771">they already announced they were laying</text>

  <text start="777.29" dur="6">so this is additional an additional</text>
  <text start="779.47" dur="6.849">10,000 people do we think this is where</text>
  <text start="783.29" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s going to end absolutely not because</text>
  <text start="786.319" dur="3.39">right now they&amp;#39;re getting rid of when</text>
  <text start="788.48" dur="3.289">you add these two numbers of about</text>
  <text start="789.709" dur="4.891">twenty percent of their workforce and</text>
  <text start="791.769" dur="5.44">when you add these numbers together it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="794.6" dur="5.25">pretty much one in five people that</text>
  <text start="797.209" dur="4.79">they&amp;#39;re going to be laying off and I</text>
  <text start="799.85" dur="4.62">think this is not even enough yet</text>
  <text start="801.999" dur="5.59">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing with Deutsche</text>
  <text start="804.47" dur="7.039">Bank is that investors are getting</text>
  <text start="807.589" dur="5.881">scared shareholders are getting worried</text>
  <text start="811.509" dur="5.231">they&amp;#39;re worried about the long-term</text>
  <text start="813.47" dur="5.339">strategy of the bank we know that the</text>
  <text start="816.74" dur="6.059">German government has rolled out</text>
  <text start="818.809" dur="6.9">bailouts because what they said is that</text>
  <text start="822.799" dur="7.5">they have a different bank resolution</text>
  <text start="825.709" dur="6.961">system that was created a couple years</text>
  <text start="830.299" dur="4.02">ago and we all know what that is because</text>
  <text start="832.67" dur="4.769">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about this for quite</text>
  <text start="834.319" dur="7.68">a while they&amp;#39;re referring to the recent</text>
  <text start="837.439" dur="8.221">legal changes in Europe which means the</text>
  <text start="841.999" dur="5.311">European governments they can&amp;#39;t go ahead</text>
  <text start="845.66" dur="5.28">and bail out</text>
  <text start="847.31" dur="6.69">these banks they have to do a balun to</text>
  <text start="850.94" dur="7.26">creditors and in some cases yes</text>
  <text start="854" dur="6.8">depositors before they shore up a</text>
  <text start="858.2" dur="6.53">struggling bank with taxpayer money</text>
  <text start="860.8" dur="7.6">wealth that money that&amp;#39;s in the bank is</text>
  <text start="864.73" dur="6.609">taxpayer money anyhow because who do you</text>
  <text start="868.4" dur="5.52">think has the money in the bank it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="871.339" dur="4.351">people so what they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="873.92" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re going to give them worthless</text>
  <text start="875.69" dur="5.51">bank stock they&amp;#39;re going to put a hold</text>
  <text start="878.39" dur="5.85">on your account they&amp;#39;re going to go in</text>
  <text start="881.2" dur="5.88">electronically and siphon off what they</text>
  <text start="884.24" dur="5.76">need just like they did in Cyprus and</text>
  <text start="887.08" dur="6.37">they&amp;#39;ll tell you well the stocks that</text>
  <text start="890" dur="5.82">you have don&amp;#39;t mature you know you&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="893.45" dur="5.76">able to trade them in with within maybe</text>
  <text start="895.82" dur="6.42">five or ten years and at this point we</text>
  <text start="899.21" dur="6.629">can&amp;#39;t allow you to take out more than X</text>
  <text start="902.24" dur="6.06">amount each week and you can&amp;#39;t transfer</text>
  <text start="905.839" dur="4.831">your funds out of the bank either so</text>
  <text start="908.3" dur="5.21">your funds are stuck there and as we</text>
  <text start="910.67" dur="6.12">know as the bank continually slides into</text>
  <text start="913.51" dur="5.92">an area where they can&amp;#39;t they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="916.79" dur="4.62">recover and it affects other banks this</text>
  <text start="919.43" dur="7.56">is going to be a complete disaster now</text>
  <text start="921.41" dur="7.71">remember during this period the FDIC is</text>
  <text start="926.99" dur="6.27">not going to step in because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="929.12" dur="5.94">going to be doing the balance if the</text>
  <text start="933.26" dur="4.079">banks are hit with a cyberattack the</text>
  <text start="935.06" dur="6.8">FDIC is definitely not going to be</text>
  <text start="937.339" dur="7.401">stepping in and right now the FDIC and</text>
  <text start="941.86" dur="5.91">the other insurance around the world</text>
  <text start="944.74" dur="5.8">there&amp;#39;s not enough to cover all of this</text>
  <text start="947.77" dur="5.98">it&amp;#39;s completely impossible and what</text>
  <text start="950.54" dur="8.19">we&amp;#39;re seeing now is a complete breakdown</text>
  <text start="953.75" dur="7.44">of the system it starts very slowly in a</text>
  <text start="958.73" dur="4.56">certain area the government&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="961.19" dur="3.81">corporate media they continually tell</text>
  <text start="963.29" dur="4.86">you everything&amp;#39;s going to be fine don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="965" dur="7.08">worry about it and they continually tell</text>
  <text start="968.15" dur="5.43">you this until it&amp;#39;s too late and what</text>
  <text start="972.08" dur="4.05">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the beginning</text>
  <text start="973.58" dur="5.57">stages of this they&amp;#39;re letting you know</text>
  <text start="976.13" dur="4.89">that they&amp;#39;re having a problem and</text>
