  <text start="112.01" dur="3.78">these and of course they&amp;#39;re just waiting</text>
  <text start="114.38" dur="5.64">for the right moment they&amp;#39;re hoping that</text>
  <text start="115.79" dur="6.03">setup passes and this way TTIP and TPP</text>
  <text start="120.02" dur="4.41">will be right behind it because they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="121.82" dur="5.58">try to make the case why that you need</text>
  <text start="124.43" dur="5.13">to be together and we see out in Canada</text>
  <text start="127.4" dur="4.14">that you Canada&amp;#39;s green party they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="129.56" dur="4.679">trying to remove a clause on the</text>
  <text start="131.54" dur="5.85">investment court system the ICS which is</text>
  <text start="134.239" dur="7.051">that secret corporate court system which</text>
  <text start="137.39" dur="8.4">is above the government&amp;#39;s court system</text>
  <text start="141.29" dur="8.34">and they want that removed from seta</text>
  <text start="145.79" dur="6.57">completely and we know the globalists</text>
  <text start="149.63" dur="4.29">the elite the central bankers that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="152.36" dur="4.17">whole reason they want this pass because</text>
  <text start="153.92" dur="6.21">they want that in there so we see</text>
  <text start="156.53" dur="6.72">Elizabeth May the leader of the Canada&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="160.13" dur="5.669">Greens she will continue to advocate for</text>
  <text start="163.25" dur="4.079">the removal of the ICS where the isds</text>
  <text start="165.799" dur="6.241">which is the investor state dispute</text>
  <text start="167.329" dur="6.781">settlement for the TTIP and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="172.04" dur="5.94">saying this needs to be removed from the</text>
  <text start="174.11" dur="5.13">trade deal completely and we can see</text>
  <text start="177.98" dur="6.3">right now</text>
  <text start="179.24" dur="8.34">seta passes and is ratified we can see</text>
  <text start="184.28" dur="8.54">what they&amp;#39;re expecting to do is to have</text>
  <text start="187.58" dur="7.86">the TPP the TTIP passed after that</text>
  <text start="192.82" dur="4.54">because they&amp;#39;ll make the case of why</text>
  <text start="195.44" dur="5.69">they need to do it now remember they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="197.36" dur="6.6">doing this because they want a one-world</text>
  <text start="201.13" dur="4.66">system where they control everything and</text>
  <text start="203.96" dur="3.9">then having the court above the</text>
  <text start="205.79" dur="5.4">sovereign government allows them to do</text>
  <text start="207.86" dur="5.52">this now think about all the things they</text>
  <text start="211.19" dur="4.47">need to do to have a one-world</text>
  <text start="213.38" dur="2.94">government you need to control the</text>
  <text start="215.66" dur="3.48">Internet</text>
  <text start="216.32" dur="5.58">well we know Obama passed that over to</text>
  <text start="219.14" dur="5.49">the UN the UN now controls the internet</text>
  <text start="221.9" dur="6.18">for the entire world they need to</text>
  <text start="224.63" dur="5.97">control the creation of currency well</text>
  <text start="228.08" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re looking to go into a one-world</text>
  <text start="230.6" dur="4.89">currency that&amp;#39;s what this transition is</text>
  <text start="233.9" dur="4.38">about this is what happens when the</text>
  <text start="235.49" dur="6.36">petro dollar dies they&amp;#39;re going to use a</text>
  <text start="238.28" dur="6.33">one-world currency they need to control</text>
  <text start="241.85" dur="6.24">the corporate media which they already</text>
  <text start="244.61" dur="6.69">have and they need to control the</text>
  <text start="248.09" dur="6.78">government&amp;#39;s through some type of system</text>
  <text start="251.3" dur="5.97">which is above their constitutions which</text>
  <text start="254.87" dur="5.46">is above the rights of the people which</text>
  <text start="257.27" dur="6.51">is above everything the government&amp;#39;s can</text>
  <text start="260.33" dur="7.59">rule on and they almost have it because</text>
  <text start="263.78" dur="7.86">they have the internet with the UN they</text>
  <text start="267.92" dur="6.12">have the control of the flow of</text>
  <text start="271.64" dur="5.27">information through the corporate media</text>
  <text start="274.04" dur="6.24">and now with the UN with the internet I</text>
  <text start="276.91" dur="5.17">mean they haven&amp;#39;t pushed that just yet</text>
  <text start="280.28" dur="3.83">but we can see coming down the line</text>
  <text start="282.08" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s exactly what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="284.11" dur="6.54">we can see that they&amp;#39;re getting prepared</text>
  <text start="286.37" dur="6.45">for some type of one-world currency and</text>
  <text start="290.65" dur="5.44">all they need is control the government</text>
  <text start="292.82" dur="9.72">so they&amp;#39;re very close in to controlling</text>
  <text start="296.09" dur="7.98">the entire world from the top and this</text>
  <text start="302.54" dur="4.19">is what they wanted from the beginning</text>
  <text start="304.07" dur="5.57">and then eventually once they have that</text>
  <text start="306.73" dur="5.08">they&amp;#39;ll start chipping away at laws</text>
  <text start="309.64" dur="3.249">they&amp;#39;ll start chipping away at the</text>
  <text start="311.81" dur="2.669">rights</text>
  <text start="312.889" dur="5.84">of the people they&amp;#39;ll start chipping</text>
  <text start="314.479" dur="6.601">away everything that we hold dear and</text>
  <text start="318.729" dur="4.301">they&amp;#39;ll do this very slowly they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="321.08" dur="5.639">do anything very very quick quickly</text>
  <text start="323.03" dur="5.28">because people catch on and they do it</text>
  <text start="326.719" dur="5.04">very slowly to make it seem like it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="328.31" dur="5.579">your best interest this is the way these</text>
  <text start="331.759" dur="4.891">globalist the elites do this they do it</text>
  <text start="333.889" dur="4.49">very slowly and make it seem like it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="336.65" dur="4.169">really good thing I&amp;#39;ll bring up the</text>
  <text start="338.379" dur="4.181">example of taxes when they were</text>
  <text start="340.819" dur="4.291">implementing the taxes they said listen</text>
  <text start="342.56" dur="4.949">we&amp;#39;re only going to tax the rich and of</text>
  <text start="345.11" dur="3.089">course the middle class the poor they</text>
  <text start="347.509" dur="2.19">said yes</text>
  <text start="348.199" dur="4.171">those people should be taxed because</text>
  <text start="349.699" dur="4.861">they have the money when everyone was</text>
  <text start="352.37" dur="5.34">like yes we agree with you and then</text>
  <text start="354.56" dur="6.15">slowly but surely what they did was they</text>
  <text start="357.71" dur="6.54">moved the taxes down to the upper middle</text>
  <text start="360.71" dur="6.75">class and down to the middle class then</text>
  <text start="364.25" dur="5.58">down to the lower middle class down to</text>
  <text start="367.46" dur="5.549">the poverty level and they continually</text>
  <text start="369.83" dur="7.259">did this and people accepted it each</text>
  <text start="373.009" dur="7.801">time and before you knew it everyone was</text>
  <text start="377.089" dur="5.851">being taxed well they&amp;#39;re going to do the</text>
  <text start="380.81" dur="4.65">same thing again they&amp;#39;re going to do it</text>
  <text start="382.94" dur="5.31">very slowly very methodically without</text>
  <text start="385.46" dur="5.579">anyone realizing that it&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="388.25" dur="6.449">this is the way they work their magic on</text>
  <text start="391.039" dur="7.47">the people remember laws that they</text>
  <text start="394.699" dur="6.83">create always sound like they&amp;#39;re in your</text>
  <text start="398.509" dur="5.701">best interest it&amp;#39;s always the opposite</text>
  <text start="401.529" dur="3.25">they always tell you it&amp;#39;s for the good</text>
  <text start="404.21" dur="3.66">of the people</text>
  <text start="404.779" dur="6.181">it&amp;#39;s the always the opposite everything</text>
  <text start="407.87" dur="6.69">they&amp;#39;re doing is for themselves not for</text>
  <text start="410.96" dur="7.229">the people and they will do this over</text>
  <text start="414.56" dur="5.34">time and it&amp;#39;s up to us we the people</text>
  <text start="418.189" dur="5.01">here in the United States and Canada</text>
  <text start="419.9" dur="4.799">Europe Australia UK and everyone else</text>
  <text start="423.199" dur="3.481">around the world to say you know</text>
  <text start="424.699" dur="3.87">something we&amp;#39;re not going along with</text>
  <text start="426.68" dur="4.47">this because it&amp;#39;s getting to the point</text>
  <text start="428.569" dur="4.921">right now where we&amp;#39;re running out of</text>
  <text start="431.15" dur="6.03">time because they&amp;#39;re making their moves</text>
  <text start="433.49" dur="6.599">they know that this system is dying they</text>
  <text start="437.18" dur="7.2">know that they need to get everything</text>
  <text start="440.089" dur="6.151">into place because once they restart the</text>
  <text start="444.38" dur="2.309">system of course they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="446.24" dur="4.079">most</text>
  <text start="446.689" dur="6.75">war to cover it up but once they restart</text>
  <text start="450.319" dur="4.2">this system they&amp;#39;re gonna change</text>
  <text start="453.439" dur="5.19">everything</text>
  <text start="454.519" dur="6.42">and we can see right now that we need to</text>
  <text start="458.629" dur="4.08">get ready prepared and we need to call</text>
  <text start="460.939" dur="5.58">them out on it we need to come together</text>
  <text start="462.709" dur="6.6">as a people we need to stop looking at</text>
  <text start="466.519" dur="4.62">Republican Democrat and all these</text>
  <text start="469.309" dur="5.7">different candidates and say you know</text>
  <text start="471.139" dur="7.11">something enough Sanath we&amp;#39;re done with</text>
  <text start="475.009" dur="6.2">the system we the people want a clean</text>
  <text start="478.249" dur="6.66">house here we want the central bank on</text>
  <text start="481.209" dur="6.31">we want to be in control of our monetary</text>
  <text start="484.909" dur="6.42">system we want to be in control of our</text>
  <text start="487.519" dur="5.58">laws we want the laws to be equal among</text>
  <text start="491.329" dur="4.02">those people who are in government and</text>
  <text start="493.099" dur="4.68">those people who are the everyday person</text>
  <text start="495.349" dur="6.6">we want to be in control of our lives</text>
  <text start="497.779" dur="6.6">and we can see right now that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="501.949" dur="6.15">coming to a time period where we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="504.379" dur="7.77">going to have to make a decision now out</text>
  <text start="508.099" dur="8.37">in the Black Sea NATO is pushing for a</text>
  <text start="512.149" dur="6.69">military buildup in that area and it</text>
  <text start="516.469" dur="5.91">looks like they want to bring in their</text>
  <text start="518.839" dur="5.881">ships they want to have a port on the</text>
  <text start="522.379" dur="4.32">Black Sea and they are pushing this</text>
  <text start="524.72" dur="4.679">right now because they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="526.699" dur="4.95">position themselves for when the war</text>
  <text start="529.399" dur="4.591">starts and we can see that a lot of the</text>
  <text start="531.649" dur="5.49">military equipment military assets</text>
  <text start="533.99" dur="6.659">military troops they&amp;#39;re moving them all</text>
  <text start="537.139" dur="7.651">around the world preparing we see that</text>
  <text start="540.649" dur="8.67">the u.s. deployed the sea-based x-band</text>
  <text start="544.79" dur="9">radar and this is this huge radar system</text>
  <text start="549.319" dur="8.13">on a platform and they moved it to off</text>
  <text start="553.79" dur="6.45">the coast of North Korea and we can see</text>
  <text start="557.449" dur="5.341">right now they kept it there for the</text>
  <text start="560.24" dur="6.779">month of September and then they took it</text>
  <text start="562.79" dur="7.169">and they brought it back in late October</text>
  <text start="567.019" dur="5.49">and right now there are no details on</text>
  <text start="569.959" dur="5.091">what the SP X&amp;#39;s mission off the Korean</text>
  <text start="572.509" dur="5.491">Peninsula was but we know they were</text>
  <text start="575.05" dur="5.019">tracking long-range ballistic missiles</text>
  <text start="578" dur="2.67">they wanted to see what North Korea was</text>
  <text start="580.069" dur="3.631">up to</text>
  <text start="580.67" dur="5.43">and most likely they didn&amp;#39;t really find</text>
  <text start="583.7" dur="4.05">out that much because I know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="586.1" dur="3.39">lot of reports that North Korea is</text>
  <text start="587.75" dur="3.48">developing a nuclear weapon they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="589.49" dur="4.77">attaching it to a ballistic missile and</text>
  <text start="591.23" dur="5.94">the question is why would they want to</text>
  <text start="594.26" dur="6.21">attack the United States because they</text>
  <text start="597.17" dur="5.07">know if they do attack the United States</text>
  <text start="600.47" dur="3.96">yes maybe they get one or two missiles</text>
  <text start="602.24" dur="7.2">off maybe though maybe they would hit a</text>
  <text start="604.43" dur="7.349">city but the outcome would be total</text>
  <text start="609.44" dur="4.889">destruction of their country because the</text>
  <text start="611.779" dur="6.75">United States is part of NATO the United</text>
  <text start="614.329" dur="5.88">States has nuclear weapons and really</text>
  <text start="618.529" dur="4.021">North Korea really has no defense</text>
  <text start="620.209" dur="5.011">against this and they would be</text>
  <text start="622.55" dur="4.95">annihilated so it really makes no sense</text>
  <text start="625.22" dur="4.32">in what the US government central banks</text>
  <text start="627.5" dur="4.98">have been telling us what does make</text>
  <text start="629.54" dur="6.169">sense is that they&amp;#39;re trying to push and</text>
  <text start="632.48" dur="6.479">provoke North Korea into doing something</text>
  <text start="635.709" dur="5.44">North Korea is a wild card they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="638.959" dur="4.831">hoping they can get North Korea to do</text>
  <text start="641.149" dur="5.521">something to start a war and by bringing</text>
  <text start="643.79" dur="5.82">in the fad missile system by bringing in</text>
  <text start="646.67" dur="6.45">the tank brigade by placing the radar</text>
  <text start="649.61" dur="6.87">system right outside of their border in</text>
  <text start="653.12" dur="7.23">the sea flying bombers around North</text>
  <text start="656.48" dur="8.039">Korea they&amp;#39;re just hoping that North</text>
  <text start="660.35" dur="8.52">Korea loses it and does something to</text>
  <text start="664.519" dur="7.771">start this war now out in Sudan we can</text>
  <text start="668.87" dur="5.52">see the situation is not improving there</text>
  <text start="672.29" dur="4.159">whatsoever now we have to remember these</text>
  <text start="674.39" dur="5.069">countries where the u.s. went in and</text>
  <text start="676.449" dur="5.111">overthrew the bridge the government</text>
  <text start="679.459" dur="5.101">elected governments and replace them</text>
  <text start="681.56" dur="4.17">with puppet governments some countries</text>
  <text start="684.56" dur="3.269">they were able to do this some of the</text>
  <text start="685.73" dur="4.74">countries they couldn&amp;#39;t do it and we see</text>
  <text start="687.829" dur="3.12">that Sudan was split into two and right</text>
  <text start="690.47" dur="1.799">now</text>
  <text start="690.949" dur="3.481">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="692.269" dur="6.961">bankers they want the entire country of</text>
  <text start="694.43" dur="7.589">Sudan and they place sanctions on Sudan</text>
  <text start="699.23" dur="5.19">for another year and of course as we</text>
  <text start="702.019" dur="4.291">know sanctions don&amp;#39;t work they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="704.42" dur="4.169">to put pressure on the Sudanese people</text>
  <text start="706.31" dur="4.139">and they&amp;#39;re hoping that they can starve</text>

  <text start="911.06" dur="6.06">they don&amp;#39;t tell you is why are there all</text>
  <text start="914.06" dur="5.37">these refugees they just tell you that</text>
  <text start="917.12" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s our duty these people have no place</text>
  <text start="919.43" dur="7.17">to live but we need to go to the heart</text>
  <text start="922.52" dur="6.98">of the disease to cure it and the</text>
  <text start="926.6" dur="6.6">problem is it&amp;#39;s the United States as</text>
  <text start="929.5" dur="7.54">they play sanctions on Syria as they</text>
  <text start="933.2" dur="6.3">started this war in Syria to put a</text>

  <text start="956.81" dur="6.6">all over the place when people are being</text>
  <text start="958.61" dur="6.45">beheaded and it is all caused by the</text>
  <text start="963.41" dur="5.69">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="965.06" dur="8.97">this is why we see refugees in this area</text>
  <text start="969.1" dur="7.9">everyplace the United States is and that</text>
  <text start="974.03" dur="5.31">is the real problem if the United States</text>
  <text start="977" dur="5.13">would just leave these countries guess</text>
  <text start="979.34" dur="6.119">what there be no war</text>
  <text start="982.13" dur="8.04">the refugees would all go back to their</text>

  <text start="990.17" dur="3.24">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="991.579" dur="4.051">they don&amp;#39;t want that because the</text>
  <text start="993.41" dur="5.099">petrodollar system is dying they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="995.63" dur="4.17">trying to keep it propped up for them</text>

  <text start="1004.149" dur="6.3">the UN Security Council members well</text>
  <text start="1006.49" dur="5.399">they&amp;#39;ve come to terms that yes the</text>
  <text start="1010.449" dur="4.62">United States government needs to</text>
  <text start="1011.889" dur="6.151">separate the moderate rebels from the</text>
  <text start="1015.069" dur="5.541">terrorists and they&amp;#39;re saying this needs</text>
  <text start="1018.04" dur="4.919">to be done because we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1020.61" dur="4.51">terrorists are the problems the problem</text>
  <text start="1022.959" dur="2.97">is is that it&amp;#39;s all one and the same and</text>
  <text start="1025.12" dur="3.179">this is why the United States government</text>
  <text start="1025.929" dur="4.41">central bankers they just don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="1028.299" dur="3.75">ability to do it and they were never</text>
  <text start="1030.339" dur="5.73">going to do it because they know they</text>
  <text start="1032.049" dur="6.87">need all their terrorist groups to fight</text>
  <text start="1036.069" dur="5.461">in Syria so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="1038.919" dur="5.191">is things are rapidly falling apart</text>
  <text start="1041.53" dur="4.62">we&amp;#39;re seeing there&amp;#39;s recently released</text>
  <text start="1044.11" dur="4.65">footage that militants blowing to a</text>

  <text start="1053.89" dur="6.93">getting ready for this major offensive</text>
  <text start="1055.9" dur="7.29">and they moved it into a tunnel so the</text>
  <text start="1060.82" dur="4.099">Syrian and Russian fighters wouldn&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="1063.19" dur="6.06">it and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="1064.919" dur="6.37">that the moderate rebels the terrorist</text>
  <text start="1069.25" dur="4.59">groups they&amp;#39;re receiving more and more</text>
  <text start="1071.289" dur="4.62">weapons for the offensive that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1073.84" dur="4.14">on right now there&amp;#39;s about 2,000 are</text>
  <text start="1075.909" dur="3.931">so-called moderate rebels we&amp;#39;ll call</text>
  <text start="1077.98" dur="3.39">them terrorists where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1079.84" dur="5.16">continually shelling the residential</text>
  <text start="1081.37" dur="6.95">areas in Aleppo they&amp;#39;re using 22 battle</text>
  <text start="1085" dur="6.6">tanks 15 infantry fighting vehicles and</text>
  <text start="1088.32" dur="7.33">rocket artillery and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="1091.6" dur="7.199">hitting Aleppo now Russia and Syria they</text>
  <text start="1095.65" dur="4.47">have stopped bombing in Aleppo they</text>
  <text start="1098.799" dur="4.62">haven&amp;#39;t bombed there for quite a while</text>
  <text start="1100.12" dur="5.7">and we can see right now that the UN</text>
  <text start="1103.419" dur="5.49">observers are starting to realize that</text>
  <text start="1105.82" dur="5.82">it is the terrorists that are causing</text>
  <text start="1108.909" dur="5.491">the problems in Aleppo and right now</text>
  <text start="1111.64" dur="3.85">Russia is ruling out any type of peace</text>
  <text start="1114.4" dur="3.61">talks because</text>
  <text start="1115.49" dur="4.53">the rebels are continually pushing</text>
  <text start="1118.01" dur="4.94">forward in a level at least trying to</text>
  <text start="1120.02" dur="6.509">but what we can see right now is that</text>
  <text start="1122.95" dur="7.229">they&amp;#39;re offensive it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="1126.529" dur="8.311">anywhere it&amp;#39;s actually breaking down and</text>
  <text start="1130.179" dur="6.641">they&amp;#39;re not pushing the Russian forces</text>
  <text start="1134.84" dur="4.829">the Syrian forces out of this area</text>
  <text start="1136.82" dur="6.599">actually the opposite is happening and</text>
  <text start="1139.669" dur="6.961">we can see right now that if the United</text>
  <text start="1143.419" dur="6.211">States government central bankers if</text>
  <text start="1146.63" dur="7.049">they don&amp;#39;t keep Aleppo and they lose</text>

  <text start="1153.679" dur="5.671">Syria because it&amp;#39;s Russia&amp;#39;s mission and</text>

  <text start="1159.35" dur="6.84">remove that terrorists from the country</text>
  <text start="1161.419" dur="6.841">now this has a huge impact on the</text>
  <text start="1166.19" dur="5.81">economics of the United States and the</text>
  <text start="1168.26" dur="7.169">world because the petro dollar system is</text>

  <text start="1175.429" dur="5.191">its end game right now they&amp;#39;re preparing</text>
  <text start="1178.25" dur="5.61">for a transition into a brand new system</text>
  <text start="1180.62" dur="6.15">and as we know and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1183.86" dur="5.73">that once this petro dollar system</text>
  <text start="1186.77" dur="6.3">starts to fall things are going to</text>
  <text start="1189.59" dur="4.28">happen very very quickly and at this</text>
  <text start="1193.07" dur="2.88">point</text>
  <text start="1193.87" dur="6.309">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that everyone needs</text>
  <text start="1195.95" dur="7.229">to be prepared for this because as a new</text>
  <text start="1200.179" dur="8.61">system is developed and the petro dollar</text>

  <text start="1273.95" dur="3.959">course they&amp;#39;re gonna make an explanation</text>

  <text start="1277.909" dur="4.681">blame it on another group or country of</text>
  <text start="1279.74" dur="6.36">why this is all happening why we need to</text>
  <text start="1282.59" dur="7.199">go to a new system why the dollar is</text>

  <text start="1289.789" dur="5.071">and ready to go and we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="1292.37" dur="5.88">about this this is actually a collapse</text>
  <text start="1294.86" dur="6.99">of one system and a birth of a new</text>

  <text start="1301.85" dur="5.01">going to still be a central banking</text>
  <text start="1303.86" dur="5.1">system and I do believe that it&amp;#39;s not</text>

  <text start="1308.96" dur="3.51">going to be much worse for the people</text>
