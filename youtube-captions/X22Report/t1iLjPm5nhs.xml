  <text start="49.219" dur="4.891">hi and welcome you listening to the X</text>
  <text start="52.43" dur="4.92">when a to report my name is David</text>
  <text start="54.11" dur="6.719">episode 1269 B and today&amp;#39;s date is May</text>
  <text start="57.35" dur="6.029">2nd 2017 and the plot of the episode is</text>
  <text start="60.829" dur="5.641">kim jeong-hoon said something which will</text>
  <text start="63.379" dur="5.821">leave many scratching their heads let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="66.47" dur="6.17">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="69.2" dur="6.51">and geopolitical news now as we know</text>
  <text start="72.64" dur="6.13">Jared Kushner well he&amp;#39;s part of the</text>
  <text start="75.71" dur="6.269">Kushner family where his father I</text>
  <text start="78.77" dur="7.37">believe was in prison and Jared Kushner</text>
  <text start="81.979" dur="9.18">has ties to Goldman Sachs George Soros</text>
  <text start="86.14" dur="8.769">Peter Thiel and others and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="91.159" dur="7.291">interesting is that Bannon left office</text>
  <text start="94.909" dur="6.301">and Jared Kushner pretty much almost</text>
  <text start="98.45" dur="6.089">took a seat and everyone is saying that</text>
  <text start="101.21" dur="5.04">Kushner tells Trump what to do maybe</text>
  <text start="104.539" dur="3.931">this is true maybe this isn&amp;#39;t true and</text>
  <text start="106.25" dur="4.979">we have to remember that Trump is his</text>
  <text start="108.47" dur="4.349">own man and he might be hearing these</text>
  <text start="111.229" dur="4.441">things it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="112.819" dur="4.951">actually doing them and we do know that</text>
  <text start="115.67" dur="5.699">Jared Kushner he does have ties to</text>
  <text start="117.77" dur="6.12">Goldman Sachs and George Soros and Peter</text>
  <text start="121.369" dur="4.711">Thiel and when he was filling out his</text>
  <text start="123.89" dur="5.88">financial disclosure forms which</text>
  <text start="126.08" dur="5.489">required him to disclose pretty much</text>
  <text start="129.77" dur="5.79">everything for his job as White House</text>
  <text start="131.569" dur="7.231">adviser he left these things out now</text>
  <text start="135.56" dur="5.91">this is very interesting now did he do</text>
  <text start="138.8" dur="5.25">this on purpose now most likely because</text>
  <text start="141.47" dur="5.04">I&amp;#39;m sure they asked all of you know all</text>
  <text start="144.05" dur="5.31">your financial ties where you have your</text>
  <text start="146.51" dur="5.309">investments and he didn&amp;#39;t identify his</text>
  <text start="149.36" dur="4.47">partial ownership stake in cadre a tech</text>
  <text start="151.819" dur="4.14">startup carrying investors with real</text>
  <text start="153.83" dur="4.26">estate developers and other ties to</text>
  <text start="155.959" dur="6.451">large financial institutions on his</text>
  <text start="158.09" dur="6.78">disclosure form and Kushner his stake in</text>
  <text start="162.41" dur="4.799">cadre makes him business partners with</text>
  <text start="164.87" dur="6.03">other part owners such as Goldman Sachs</text>
  <text start="167.209" dur="8.25">and George Soros and tech investor Peter</text>
  <text start="170.9" dur="7.14">Thiel a prominent backer of a Trump so</text>
  <text start="175.459" dur="6.031">he definitely has these ties but the</text>
  <text start="178.04" dur="4.3">question is will they allow him to stay</text>
  <text start="181.49" dur="4.329">since he</text>
  <text start="182.34" dur="6.09">left these things off of his form and he</text>
  <text start="185.819" dur="6.871">knew that he needed to fill this out and</text>
  <text start="188.43" dur="6.33">list us because listen Flynn did not put</text>
  <text start="192.69" dur="7.04">the information that he received money</text>
  <text start="194.76" dur="10.14">from a speech from Artie and he resigned</text>
  <text start="199.73" dur="7.78">will Jared Kushner resign or will Trump</text>
  <text start="204.9" dur="5.01">get rid of him that&amp;#39;s the real question</text>
  <text start="207.51" dur="4.35">do I think he&amp;#39;s going to get rid of them</text>
  <text start="209.91" dur="4.5">so I think Trump is gonna most likely</text>
  <text start="211.86" dur="4.56">not he&amp;#39;ll probably like let it slide but</text>
  <text start="214.41" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;ll have to watch this very carefully</text>
  <text start="216.42" dur="5.31">I would like to see him gone there is no</text>
  <text start="218.91" dur="5.37">reason for him to be in office right now</text>
  <text start="221.73" dur="5.67">now Trump has dismissed speculation that</text>
  <text start="224.28" dur="5.97">his administration is split he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="227.4" dur="5.16">that Steve Bannon he is still with him</text>
  <text start="230.25" dur="4.86">and Trump added that both Bannon and</text>
  <text start="232.56" dur="4.769">RINs Priebus most likely they&amp;#39;ll stay in</text>
  <text start="235.11" dur="5.82">their roles for the next couple of</text>
  <text start="237.329" dur="5.88">months along with other key figures in</text>
  <text start="240.93" dur="5.55">his administration like Kellyanne Conway</text>
  <text start="243.209" dur="5.011">Sean Spicer and we&amp;#39;ll have to wait to</text>
  <text start="246.48" dur="3.479">see what he does at this point and I</text>
  <text start="248.22" dur="4.889">still do believe that Bannon is still</text>
  <text start="249.959" dur="6.12">with him still in his ear directing them</text>
  <text start="253.109" dur="5.041">in certain ways now something very</text>
  <text start="256.079" dur="5.581">interesting happen and we need to put</text>
  <text start="258.15" dur="6.269">this in context where the deep State the</text>
  <text start="261.66" dur="5.189">central bankers the neocons we know</text>
  <text start="264.419" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;ve been pushing war and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="266.849" dur="6.061">been trying every avenue to start a</text>
  <text start="269.849" dur="5.311">conflict we know out in Syria well that</text>
  <text start="272.91" dur="5.67">situation is not looking good for the</text>
  <text start="275.16" dur="6.54">Islamic state al nusra al Qaeda al sham</text>
  <text start="278.58" dur="5.67">the the Syrian opposition force which</text>
  <text start="281.7" dur="6.33">now has decided to go to the peace talks</text>
  <text start="284.25" dur="6.3">in Astana so we know that that whole</text>
  <text start="288.03" dur="4.02">thing is completely crumbling around the</text>
  <text start="290.55" dur="3.81">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="292.05" dur="5.19">the deep state it&amp;#39;s not working well</text>
  <text start="294.36" dur="5.64">Russia pretty much has obliterated the</text>
  <text start="297.24" dur="5.79">Islamic state in Syria and Russia is</text>
  <text start="300" dur="5.94">talking about creating these safe zones</text>
  <text start="303.03" dur="4.59">which they will manage what are they</text>
  <text start="305.94" dur="3.99">going to do it well we&amp;#39;ll have to wait</text>
  <text start="307.62" dur="5.25">and see and we know that the deep state</text>
  <text start="309.93" dur="4.89">well they laid off of Syria they laid</text>
  <text start="312.87" dur="2.87">off of Russia because they can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="314.82" dur="2.9">anything started with</text>
  <text start="315.74" dur="4.98">Russia right now they&amp;#39;re concentrating</text>
  <text start="317.72" dur="4.949">on North Korea and they decided that</text>
  <text start="320.72" dur="3.93">they will not place any other sanctions</text>
  <text start="322.669" dur="4.291">on Russia because you know why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="324.65" dur="5.37">not getting any traction there so if</text>
  <text start="326.96" dur="4.679">North Korea doesn&amp;#39;t work out and they</text>
  <text start="330.02" dur="3.78">cannot get the war started in North</text>
  <text start="331.639" dur="3.9">Korea they&amp;#39;re going to be moving towards</text>
  <text start="333.8" dur="4.97">Iran because what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="335.539" dur="6.451">is the deep state they are losing</text>
  <text start="338.77" dur="7.269">momentum in each one of these areas so</text>
  <text start="341.99" dur="8.01">they&amp;#39;re trying to find a way to keep the</text>
  <text start="346.039" dur="5.671">aggression going and this is why the</text>
  <text start="350" dur="3.75">Committee Chairman bob corker of</text>
  <text start="351.71" dur="5.609">tennessee said that we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="353.75" dur="6.24">switch and not play sanctions on russia</text>
  <text start="357.319" dur="4.5">but place them on iran with this new</text>
  <text start="359.99" dur="4.32">iranian sanction bill</text>
  <text start="361.819" dur="6.211">now of course trump did come out and say</text>
  <text start="364.31" dur="5.97">yes they are abiding by the agreement</text>
  <text start="368.03" dur="4.62">maybe not the spirit of the deal what</text>
  <text start="370.28" dur="4.889">whatever that means and we discussed</text>
  <text start="372.65" dur="4.169">that in previous reports but we can see</text>
  <text start="375.169" dur="3.93">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now because</text>
  <text start="376.819" dur="4.59">North Korea right now is not going</text>
  <text start="379.099" dur="5.151">anywhere so they need to get something</text>
  <text start="381.409" dur="5.641">else going they need to light a flame</text>
  <text start="384.25" dur="6.31">under another country and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="387.05" dur="5.669">pointing towards Iran because Syria</text>
  <text start="390.56" dur="4.829">nothing has been happening out in that</text>
  <text start="392.719" dur="3.271">area right now Russia that is not going</text>
  <text start="395.389" dur="3.301">to happen</text>
  <text start="395.99" dur="5.31">North Korea right now is a wild card the</text>
  <text start="398.69" dur="4.949">deep state is pushing as hard as they</text>
  <text start="401.3" dur="5.489">possibly can to get something started</text>
  <text start="403.639" dur="6.351">wild Trump in the background is working</text>
  <text start="406.789" dur="7.47">with Putin Xi Jinping yogurt a and</text>
  <text start="409.99" dur="5.979">others to basically stamp out the deep</text>
  <text start="414.259" dur="4.621">state and we&amp;#39;ll talk about that a little</text>
  <text start="415.969" dur="5.76">bit later in this report now Maduro well</text>
  <text start="418.88" dur="6.15">there are riots there are protests in</text>
  <text start="421.729" dur="5.49">his country and he decided to try to</text>
  <text start="425.03" dur="5.25">calm the situation down he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="427.219" dur="7.2">hike minimum wages he&amp;#39;s also going to</text>
  <text start="430.28" dur="7.41">hand out homes to the people to try to</text>
  <text start="434.419" dur="5.28">calm everything down in his country</text>
  <text start="437.69" dur="4.8">because there&amp;#39;s protests there&amp;#39;s riots</text>
  <text start="439.699" dur="4.89">saying that they want Maduro gone now</text>
  <text start="442.49" dur="3.899">all these are being ginned up by the</text>
  <text start="444.589" dur="4.471">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="446.389" dur="3.431">the deep state the neocons because they</text>
  <text start="449.06" dur="2.8">want him</text>
  <text start="449.82" dur="4.29">gone out of that country they want a</text>
  <text start="451.86" dur="5.72">puppet government in that country to</text>
  <text start="454.11" dur="7.98">control the oil to place the dollar on</text>
  <text start="457.58" dur="6.61">the natural resources of Venezuela so he</text>
  <text start="462.09" dur="4.32">is trying to hang on there he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="464.19" dur="4.71">whatever you possibly can and we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="466.41" dur="5.52">to watch that situation to see what</text>
  <text start="468.9" dur="6.48">happens as we move along here now out in</text>
  <text start="471.93" dur="6.81">North Korea we see that u.s. bombers and</text>
  <text start="475.38" dur="5.79">these are the b-1b lancer bombers they</text>
  <text start="478.74" dur="4.86">were deployed because of the rising</text>
  <text start="481.17" dur="5.7">tensions in North Korea and they flew</text>
  <text start="483.6" dur="5.28">from Guam to conduct training exercises</text>
  <text start="486.87" dur="5.1">with South Korean and Japanese air</text>
  <text start="488.88" dur="5.91">forces and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="491.97" dur="5.61">all of this that maybe this is just a</text>
  <text start="494.79" dur="5.82">huge coincidence the flight of the two</text>
  <text start="497.58" dur="5.85">bombers on Monday took place roughly at</text>
  <text start="500.61" dur="5.4">the same time as Trump said he would be</text>
  <text start="503.43" dur="5.55">honored to meet North Korean leader Kim</text>
  <text start="506.01" dur="8.67">jong-un if the circumstances were right</text>
  <text start="508.98" dur="9.27">and as his CIA director landed in South</text>
  <text start="514.68" dur="7.26">Korea for talks they just so happened to</text>
  <text start="518.25" dur="8.82">fly the bombers at that time to provoke</text>
  <text start="521.94" dur="7.68">North Korea very interesting now China</text>
  <text start="527.07" dur="4.32">is not really liking what the United</text>
  <text start="529.62" dur="4.8">States government central but China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="531.39" dur="4.47">foreign ministry well they want and what</text>
  <text start="534.42" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re saying is they want an immediate</text>
  <text start="535.86" dur="5.64">halt to the US missile shield deployed</text>
  <text start="538.14" dur="5.91">and basically the China&amp;#39;s foreign</text>
  <text start="541.5" dur="5.49">ministry Muttley voiced their opinion</text>
  <text start="544.05" dur="5.22">about it and they said we oppose the</text>
  <text start="546.99" dur="4.95">deployment of the US missile system to</text>
  <text start="549.27" dur="4.65">South Korea and call on all parties to</text>
  <text start="551.94" dur="3.69">immediately stop this process we are</text>
  <text start="553.92" dur="5.01">ready to take necessary measures to</text>
  <text start="555.63" dur="5.13">protect our interests curiously while on</text>
  <text start="558.93" dur="3.93">one hand Beijing lashed out at the</text>
  <text start="560.76" dur="3.6">shield&amp;#39;s deployment on the other the</text>
  <text start="562.86" dur="4.23">foreign ministry expressed support for</text>
  <text start="564.36" dur="5.01">Trump&amp;#39;s surprise comments that he would</text>
  <text start="567.09" dur="3.9">be honored to meet North Korean leader</text>
  <text start="569.37" dur="4.86">Kim jong-un under the right conditions</text>
  <text start="570.99" dur="6.48">and I think he took a lot of people by</text>
  <text start="574.23" dur="5.61">surprise when he did say this now I know</text>
  <text start="577.47" dur="5.01">Trump said well we want South Korea to</text>
  <text start="579.84" dur="3.78">pay for the missile shield and everyone</text>
  <text start="582.48" dur="3.33">laughed at him and</text>
  <text start="583.62" dur="4.1">we had McMasters out there saying no no</text>
  <text start="585.81" dur="4.41">South Korea is going to pay for it and</text>
  <text start="587.72" dur="5.23">from what I&amp;#39;m looking at and the reason</text>
  <text start="590.22" dur="6.09">why I think he said this is that he was</text>
  <text start="592.95" dur="6.27">trying to make a point that they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="596.31" dur="5.4">pay for any of this equipment and if you</text>
  <text start="599.22" dur="4.98">want this equipment and you&amp;#39;re and you</text>
  <text start="601.71" dur="5.19">feel that threatened then you should</text>
  <text start="604.2" dur="5.4">purchase it and he knew that the South</text>
  <text start="606.9" dur="4.23">Korean government would not purchased it</text>
  <text start="609.6" dur="3.99">and I think he already knew that there</text>
  <text start="611.13" dur="6.32">was an agreement but he wanted to show</text>
  <text start="613.59" dur="7.5">everyone that they were not willing to</text>
  <text start="617.45" dur="6.97">protect themselves too and purchase this</text>
  <text start="621.09" dur="4.83">equipment because in the end when push</text>
  <text start="624.42" dur="3.75">comes to shove and all this war</text>
  <text start="625.92" dur="5.52">mongering and you push a push away all</text>
  <text start="628.17" dur="6.45">the propaganda dollars and cents they</text>
  <text start="631.44" dur="4.5">speak the loudest and South Korea said</text>
  <text start="634.62" dur="3.96">we would have purchased this no matter</text>
  <text start="635.94" dur="5.31">what but we already made the deal they</text>
  <text start="638.58" dur="5.22">said we&amp;#39;re not paying for this plus we</text>
  <text start="641.25" dur="4.62">made a deal that we didn&amp;#39;t have to and I</text>
  <text start="643.8" dur="3.81">think he was trying to push that to let</text>
  <text start="645.87" dur="6.32">everyone know where they really stand</text>
  <text start="647.61" dur="7.2">that this whole thing is a gigantic</text>
  <text start="652.19" dur="5.38">propaganda piece that North Korea is</text>
  <text start="654.81" dur="5.22">getting ready to attack South Korea now</text>
  <text start="657.57" dur="5.88">Kim jong-un said something very</text>
  <text start="660.03" dur="5.94">interesting that he vowed to join in the</text>
  <text start="663.45" dur="4.98">fight against the global elite saying he</text>
  <text start="665.97" dur="5.7">sees 2017 as the year the new world</text>
  <text start="668.43" dur="6.51">order will collapse wait a minute he is</text>
  <text start="671.67" dur="5.19">out there telling people telling his</text>
  <text start="674.94" dur="6.69">country that the new world order is</text>
  <text start="676.86" dur="7.38">going to collapse so he understands that</text>
  <text start="681.63" dur="6.09">there&amp;#39;s a new world order he understands</text>
  <text start="684.24" dur="6.6">that the global elite the deep state</text>
  <text start="687.72" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re pushing this war and he</text>
  <text start="690.84" dur="5.58">understands that he is ready to face off</text>
  <text start="693.66" dur="5.4">with the global elite in a desperate</text>
  <text start="696.42" dur="5.79">attempt to stop the outbreak of World</text>
  <text start="699.06" dur="5.1">War 3 he went on to say I want a world</text>
  <text start="702.21" dur="4.44">without nuclear weapons without war</text>
  <text start="704.16" dur="4.5">where nations can celebrate and respect</text>
  <text start="706.65" dur="6.06">each other differences without fear in</text>
  <text start="708.66" dur="6.57">their hearts in 2017 he said I will stop</text>
  <text start="712.71" dur="4.68">the New World Order from starting World</text>
  <text start="715.23" dur="4.47">War 3 he said</text>
  <text start="717.39" dur="6.63">other awakening leaders such as Putin</text>
  <text start="719.7" dur="6.93">will I hope help me but realize this if</text>
  <text start="724.02" dur="5.37">the US continues its aggression towards</text>
  <text start="726.63" dur="4.95">our nation like a cornered animal we</text>
  <text start="729.39" dur="4.83">will fight with every ounce of our</text>
  <text start="731.58" dur="4.41">energy we have if we must show our</text>
  <text start="734.22" dur="3.99">willingness to fight using nuclear</text>
  <text start="735.99" dur="4.92">weapons then this is what we will do I</text>
  <text start="738.21" dur="5.7">will fire missiles until peace is</text>
  <text start="740.91" dur="6.09">achieved well peace is never achieved</text>
  <text start="743.91" dur="6.18">with war actually people just get killed</text>
  <text start="747" dur="6.15">in war the bankers make out in war the</text>
  <text start="750.09" dur="6.48">elite make out in conflicts like that</text>
  <text start="753.15" dur="6.48">but what he&amp;#39;s saying is that he agrees</text>
  <text start="756.57" dur="6.18">with other leaders like Putin awakened</text>
  <text start="759.63" dur="6.84">leaders and he understands what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="762.75" dur="6.99">on right now now remember in the past he</text>
  <text start="766.47" dur="6.87">said that he would speak to the u.s. he</text>
  <text start="769.74" dur="6.81">wanted to sit down and discuss the</text>
  <text start="773.34" dur="6.18">nuclear weapons and the provocation of</text>
  <text start="776.55" dur="4.53">having drills in South Korea the u.s.</text>
  <text start="779.52" dur="2.01">didn&amp;#39;t want to have anything to do with</text>
  <text start="781.08" dur="3.99">him</text>
  <text start="781.53" dur="7.31">and now there might be a chance where</text>
  <text start="785.07" dur="8.37">trump kim janghoon maybe President Xi</text>
  <text start="788.84" dur="7.03">can speak about doing all of this and we</text>
  <text start="793.44" dur="5.64">know that China and Russia well they</text>
  <text start="795.87" dur="6.48">raised this peace type of situation this</text>
  <text start="799.08" dur="7.17">deal where listen if both sides can</text>
  <text start="802.35" dur="5.43">agree and the u.s. stops the provocation</text>
  <text start="806.25" dur="3.99">with all these drills in South Korea and</text>
  <text start="807.78" dur="4.32">North Korea decides yes if you do this</text>
  <text start="810.24" dur="3.39">we will stop our nuclear program if we</text>
  <text start="812.1" dur="5.01">can come to an agreement</text>
  <text start="813.63" dur="6">well the deep state is kind of doomed at</text>
  <text start="817.11" dur="5.07">this point and the deep state does not</text>
  <text start="819.63" dur="4.02">want this to happen and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="822.18" dur="3.36">have to wait to see how this all plays</text>
  <text start="823.65" dur="4.59">out but we can see there are things</text>
  <text start="825.54" dur="5.37">behind the scenes that are in the works</text>
  <text start="828.24" dur="5.21">right now we see that Russian troops</text>
  <text start="830.91" dur="5.06">they have deployed to the Syrian border</text>
  <text start="833.45" dur="5.86">to stop Turkish attacks on the Kurds</text>
  <text start="835.97" dur="6.01">they have raised their Flags in certain</text>
  <text start="839.31" dur="5.13">areas they are reinforcing the borders</text>
  <text start="841.98" dur="6.96">and we can see right now that the</text>
  <text start="844.44" dur="6.51">situation in Syria is not as bad as it</text>
  <text start="848.94" dur="4.23">was before</text>
  <text start="850.95" dur="3.66">a lot of the Islamic state is gone and</text>
  <text start="853.17" dur="4.74">the terrorist groups are being</text>
  <text start="854.61" dur="5.01">dismantled and the Syrian opposition has</text>
  <text start="857.91" dur="3.81">decided to go to the peace talks</text>
  <text start="859.62" dur="4.17">because remember last time the CIA paid</text>
  <text start="861.72" dur="4.35">that not to go to the peace talks we can</text>
  <text start="863.79" dur="6.33">see the situation in Syria where Russia</text>
  <text start="866.07" dur="7.08">and the and Assad they are gaining</text>
  <text start="870.12" dur="7.71">control of more and more of the country</text>
  <text start="873.15" dur="7.29">now Trump made a statement about North</text>
  <text start="877.83" dur="6.03">Korea and Syria which I thought was very</text>
  <text start="880.44" dur="5.22">very interesting remember a while ago in</text>
  <text start="883.86" dur="4.65">each report maybe I think was yesterday</text>
  <text start="885.66" dur="6.81">to where I discussed how the deep state</text>
  <text start="888.51" dur="6">they speak in deep state speak where</text>
  <text start="892.47" dur="4.59">they deal in absolutes red lines you</text>
  <text start="894.51" dur="7.53">with us here against us that type of</text>
  <text start="897.06" dur="8.73">speak Trump came out and he said I have</text>
  <text start="902.04" dur="8.16">no intention of drawing a red line when</text>
  <text start="905.79" dur="7.5">it comes to North Korea or Syria I am</text>
  <text start="910.2" dur="5.97">NOT like Obama where you draw red line</text>
  <text start="913.29" dur="7.26">on the sand because lots of bad things</text>
  <text start="916.17" dur="6.75">happen when you do that he understands</text>
  <text start="920.55" dur="6.75">this because when you say something like</text>
  <text start="922.92" dur="6.99">if you fire another missile we will do</text>
  <text start="927.3" dur="6.03">something at that point that is our red</text>
  <text start="929.91" dur="6.03">line you know the country is going to</text>
  <text start="933.33" dur="5.34">fire the missile you know the whole</text>
  <text start="935.94" dur="5.22">thing was just set up you know they</text>
  <text start="938.67" dur="4.92">wanted them to do this I mean it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="941.16" dur="3.66">saying if you blink I will punch you</text>
  <text start="943.59" dur="4.05">well you know the person is going to</text>
  <text start="944.82" dur="6.3">blink and this is what the deep state</text>
  <text start="947.64" dur="6.27">does they deal in these absolutes and</text>
  <text start="951.12" dur="4.11">they set the whole thing up and they</text>
  <text start="953.91" dur="3.99">make it sound good on the corporate</text>
  <text start="955.23" dur="4.17">media well one more missile launch and</text>
  <text start="957.9" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;re going to have an all-out war</text>
  <text start="959.4" dur="5.85">because how dare they fire a missile in</text>
  <text start="962.76" dur="4.23">their country and they test their own</text>
  <text start="965.25" dur="3.78">defensive systems that&amp;#39;s just not</text>
  <text start="966.99" dur="4.68">allowed I mean they did it with Russia</text>
  <text start="969.03" dur="4.23">well Russia is building up troops inside</text>
  <text start="971.67" dur="3.72">of their country I mean think about how</text>
  <text start="973.26" dur="4.56">ridiculous this sounds yes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="975.39" dur="4.44">bringing troops up to their border you</text>
  <text start="977.82" dur="3.75">mean their own border inside their own</text>
  <text start="979.83" dur="4.68">country you mean they haven&amp;#39;t cross the</text>
  <text start="981.57" dur="3.28">border they haven&amp;#39;t invaded anyone yeah</text>
  <text start="984.51" dur="3.639">that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="984.85" dur="6.359">scary that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s just a recipe for</text>
  <text start="988.149" dur="5.581">war I mean what they talk about and what</text>
  <text start="991.209" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s all designed to</text>
  <text start="993.73" dur="5.909">scare and to get us all riled up so we</text>
  <text start="997.209" dur="4.88">can go to war for them that&amp;#39;s what this</text>
  <text start="999.639" dur="5.461">is all about now we have Trump and Putin</text>
  <text start="1002.089" dur="5.74">they&amp;#39;re talking on the phone</text>
  <text start="1005.1" dur="4.5">they held a phone conversation in which</text>
  <text start="1007.829" dur="3.99">they agreed to meet in July and work</text>
  <text start="1009.6" dur="5.429">together just to try to strengthen a</text>
  <text start="1011.819" dur="6.871">ceasefire in Syria and to work out the</text>
  <text start="1015.029" dur="5.451">tension in North Korea and they talked</text>
  <text start="1018.69" dur="4.68">about many different things about</text>
  <text start="1020.48" dur="5.62">decreasing the level of tensions in the</text>
  <text start="1023.37" dur="5.16">area they agreed to work jointly on a</text>
  <text start="1026.1" dur="6.059">diplomatic solution that will settle</text>
  <text start="1028.53" dur="5.82">settle the crisis and we know that Putin</text>
  <text start="1032.159" dur="5.731">from everything that we&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="1034.35" dur="6.75">at in the past if he wanted a war to</text>
  <text start="1037.89" dur="4.38">start he would have started one back in</text>
  <text start="1041.1" dur="3.089">2013</text>
  <text start="1042.27" dur="4.62">when the u.s. said we were going in</text>
  <text start="1044.189" dur="5.431">there to bomb Assad for a false flag</text>
  <text start="1046.89" dur="5.48">sarin gas attack instead he calmed the</text>
  <text start="1049.62" dur="5.039">situation down the same thing in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1052.37" dur="4.539">instead of coming up with the Minsk one</text>
  <text start="1054.659" dur="4.14">the Minsk to agreement to calm the</text>
  <text start="1056.909" dur="4.051">situation down because the United States</text>
  <text start="1058.799" dur="3.421">went into Ukraine had a coup d&amp;#39;etat they</text>
  <text start="1060.96" dur="4.53">wanted to take over the rest of the</text>
  <text start="1062.22" dur="4.8">country and Putin said no wait a minute</text>
  <text start="1065.49" dur="3.689">these people don&amp;#39;t want to be part of</text>
  <text start="1067.02" dur="4.08">this these people don&amp;#39;t want to be part</text>
  <text start="1069.179" dur="4.411">of this you can&amp;#39;t force people to do</text>
  <text start="1071.1" dur="5.579">this same thing in Syria right now</text>
  <text start="1073.59" dur="5.579">Lavrov is out there begging the United</text>
  <text start="1076.679" dur="4.051">States to team up with them to go after</text>
  <text start="1079.169" dur="4.111">the Islamic state and the terrorist</text>
  <text start="1080.73" dur="4.86">groups but during the Obama</text>
  <text start="1083.28" dur="5.509">administration this wasn&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="1085.59" dur="5.55">happen because we know the CIA Obama</text>
  <text start="1088.789" dur="5.77">they were supporting the terrorist</text>
  <text start="1091.14" dur="5.31">groups today we&amp;#39;re not too sure is Trump</text>
  <text start="1094.559" dur="3.721">actually supporting the terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="1096.45" dur="5.75">or is he going to get on the phone with</text>
  <text start="1098.28" dur="7.259">Putin and join forces to fight the</text>
  <text start="1102.2" dur="7.06">intelligent groups terrorist groups that</text>
  <text start="1105.539" dur="7.081">would be the best an idea now there is a</text>
  <text start="1109.26" dur="6.12">u.s. terror alert warning citizens</text>
  <text start="1112.62" dur="5.97">traveling to Europe and they can expect</text>

  <text start="1171.81" dur="5.49">terrorist attack to halt the elections</text>
