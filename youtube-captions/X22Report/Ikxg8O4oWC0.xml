  <text start="43.73" dur="6.329">for something much bigger let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="47.42" dur="6">the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="50.059" dur="6.091">geopolitical news now we understand at</text>
  <text start="53.42" dur="5.22">this point that the US government and</text>
  <text start="56.15" dur="6.65">the powers the bay they are pushing a</text>
  <text start="58.64" dur="6.479">race war a war against Authority and</text>
  <text start="62.8" dur="5.11">they are pushing quite hard because</text>
  <text start="65.119" dur="7.11">we&amp;#39;ve seen this shooting in Baton Rouge</text>
  <text start="67.91" dur="7.62">where there was this Gavin Eugene he</text>
  <text start="72.229" dur="6.901">went out and he killed three wounding</text>
  <text start="75.53" dur="8.79">three others and he was in the military</text>
  <text start="79.13" dur="8.64">and we can see right now that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="84.32" dur="5.64">trying to push this as hard as they</text>
  <text start="87.77" dur="3.959">possibly can because when we look at the</text>
  <text start="89.96" dur="5.4">situation and we look at what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="91.729" dur="6.57">here in the US and around the world the</text>
  <text start="95.36" dur="6.06">economic system is collapsing I mean</text>
  <text start="98.299" dur="5.851">that is a fact we&amp;#39;ve been documenting it</text>
  <text start="101.42" dur="4.739">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking it we know the</text>
  <text start="104.15" dur="6.09">economic indicators they&amp;#39;re declining</text>
  <text start="106.159" dur="7.021">rapidly the narrative that we have</text>
  <text start="110.24" dur="5.97">improved the economy that were recovered</text>
  <text start="113.18" dur="7.369">is completely falling apart and we can</text>
  <text start="116.21" dur="7.82">see that the world is reeling from</text>
  <text start="120.549" dur="8.111">everything that the US has done and</text>
  <text start="124.03" dur="6.97">their last objective is to get the</text>
  <text start="128.66" dur="4.5">people fighting with each other not just</text>
  <text start="131" dur="5.22">here in the United States but in other</text>
  <text start="133.16" dur="9.09">countries take away more rights other</text>
  <text start="136.22" dur="8.519">people create more laws start a war to</text>
  <text start="142.25" dur="3.959">cover up what is coming and we can see</text>
  <text start="144.739" dur="5.581">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="146.209" dur="6.331">pushing the idea that we have a major</text>
  <text start="150.32" dur="4.35">problem in this country now I know a lot</text>
  <text start="152.54" dur="3.75">of people saying yes we do well the</text>
  <text start="154.67" dur="3.21">corporate media continually comes out</text>
  <text start="156.29" dur="4.529">and they keep repeating the same thing</text>
  <text start="157.88" dur="5.939">over and over and over until everyone</text>
  <text start="160.819" dur="5.01">believes there is a problem this is</text>
  <text start="163.819" dur="5.04">what they&amp;#39;ve done many times before and</text>
  <text start="165.829" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re doing it now and we can see that</text>
  <text start="168.859" dur="5.85">this person and it doesn&amp;#39;t even matter</text>
  <text start="171.469" dur="5.22">these false flags we doesn&amp;#39;t even matter</text>
  <text start="174.709" dur="5.161">going through each one of them anymore</text>
  <text start="176.689" dur="7.89">because we realize this is the agenda of</text>
  <text start="179.87" dur="6.179">the US government central bankers and we</text>
  <text start="184.579" dur="4.11">can see that they&amp;#39;re even pushing the</text>
  <text start="186.049" dur="6.69">idea that this person was part of an</text>
  <text start="188.689" dur="8.761">anti-government group remember they</text>
  <text start="192.739" dur="7.53">moved their entire way of thinking away</text>
  <text start="197.45" dur="3.989">from terrorism now there are certain</text>
  <text start="200.269" dur="3.211">parts of the government that are saying</text>
  <text start="201.439" dur="3.51">yes it&amp;#39;s Islamic state and things like</text>
  <text start="203.48" dur="4.8">that that we&amp;#39;ve seen but if you notice</text>
  <text start="204.949" dur="6">the president and jay johnson who backs</text>
  <text start="208.28" dur="7.53">the president they continually used the</text>
  <text start="210.949" dur="7.861">words domestic terrorism that we have a</text>
  <text start="215.81" dur="7.349">problem with the people in the united</text>
  <text start="218.81" dur="9.419">states this is our major made this is</text>
  <text start="223.159" dur="9.03">our main concern the people here who are</text>
  <text start="228.229" dur="6.48">against the government because what</text>
  <text start="232.189" dur="5.48">they&amp;#39;re worried about is an uprising and</text>
  <text start="234.709" dur="6.36">they&amp;#39;re trying to basically squash it</text>
  <text start="237.669" dur="5.921">right now they&amp;#39;re trying to stop it to</text>
  <text start="241.069" dur="7.26">say look these are crazy people out here</text>
  <text start="243.59" dur="8.729">they&amp;#39;re anti-government they&amp;#39;re part of</text>
  <text start="248.329" dur="6.63">Patriot groups tax activists they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="252.319" dur="4.92">part of militias you don&amp;#39;t to be any</text>
  <text start="254.959" dur="5.671">part of this these are the crazy people</text>
  <text start="257.239" dur="6.21">and it looks like this is part of their</text>
  <text start="260.63" dur="6.87">agenda to say that these groups are</text>
  <text start="263.449" dur="8.75">attacking the police these groups are a</text>
  <text start="267.5" dur="9.36">problem and while they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="272.199" dur="8.5">they&amp;#39;re trying to push race Wars they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="276.86" dur="8.19">doing all of this at once this is mainly</text>
  <text start="280.699" dur="7.31">a distraction this is a major</text>
  <text start="285.05" dur="7.14">distraction here in the United States</text>
  <text start="288.009" dur="7.09">from what is really coming because as we</text>
  <text start="292.19" dur="4.87">can see many things are occurring at</text>
  <text start="295.099" dur="3.661">once the</text>
  <text start="297.06" dur="6.03">the least is completely out of control</text>
  <text start="298.76" dur="8.95">we have this coup in Turkey the u.s.</text>
  <text start="303.09" dur="6.93">right now is losing its edge in Syria</text>
  <text start="307.71" dur="5.37">which they&amp;#39;ve been fighting to remove</text>
  <text start="310.02" dur="4.44">that leader for six years or so because</text>
  <text start="313.08" dur="4.53">they thought eventually they get into</text>
  <text start="314.46" dur="5.31">Iran they made a nuclear agreement with</text>
  <text start="317.61" dur="4.62">Iran thinking they&amp;#39;d be able to get in</text>
  <text start="319.77" dur="5.76">their central banks and have them use</text>
  <text start="322.23" dur="5.61">the dollar on their natural resources on</text>
  <text start="325.53" dur="3.18">oil but Iran finally came out and said</text>
  <text start="327.84" dur="3.21">no we&amp;#39;re not going to be using the</text>
  <text start="328.71" dur="6.53">dollar sorry about that and this is a</text>
  <text start="331.05" dur="7.38">major problem for the u.s. so while</text>
  <text start="335.24" dur="5.77">everything falls apart they need to</text>
  <text start="338.43" dur="4.85">distract everyone they need to keep the</text>
  <text start="341.01" dur="6.42">people fighting amongst each other and</text>
  <text start="343.28" dur="7.9">this is one of their agendas very</text>
  <text start="347.43" dur="6.239">interestingly where they keep telling us</text>
  <text start="351.18" dur="4.29">there&amp;#39;s you know problems with weapons</text>
  <text start="353.669" dur="4.681">and this is we can see there they want</text>
  <text start="355.47" dur="4.59">to take our weapons away and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="358.35" dur="3.45">because of the reasons they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="360.06" dur="4.14">us it&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;re very nervous</text>
  <text start="361.8" dur="4.56">about the American person having a</text>
  <text start="364.2" dur="6.06">weapon because it&amp;#39;s a threat to their</text>
  <text start="366.36" dur="5.76">authority but if you look at the real</text>
  <text start="370.26" dur="4.08">statistics and you look at what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="372.12" dur="5.609">on here you see that actually the</text>
  <text start="374.34" dur="8.28">homicide rate is the lowest since 1905</text>
  <text start="377.729" dur="8.671">and if you go back in time during let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="382.62" dur="7.23">say prohibition when it began when it</text>
  <text start="386.4" dur="6.829">ended when it reached its peak very</text>
  <text start="389.85" dur="7.47">oddly this was a government operation</text>
  <text start="393.229" dur="8.101">the homicide rate increased as soon as</text>
  <text start="397.32" dur="8.01">prohibition ended the homicide rate</text>
  <text start="401.33" dur="6.55">dropped down when the US government came</text>
  <text start="405.33" dur="9.899">out and said we&amp;#39;re conducting the war on</text>
  <text start="407.88" dur="11.759">drugs the homicide rate spiked stayed up</text>
  <text start="415.229" dur="8.611">there as soon as the state&amp;#39;s move to</text>
  <text start="419.639" dur="6.931">allow concealed carry permits all of a</text>
  <text start="423.84" dur="6.55">sudden the homicide rate started to drop</text>
  <text start="426.57" dur="7.15">as more and more people purchased</text>
  <text start="430.39" dur="5.67">weapons because of all these false flags</text>
  <text start="433.72" dur="4.2">because we know the number of checks</text>
  <text start="436.06" dur="5.88">with the FBI has increased dramatically</text>
  <text start="437.92" dur="9.15">gun sales are through the roof homicide</text>
  <text start="441.94" dur="8.55">rates have dropped but guns are the</text>
  <text start="447.07" dur="6.27">problem it&amp;#39;s very interesting because</text>
  <text start="450.49" dur="7.32">during the presidency of Obama we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="453.34" dur="6.51">seen many mass shootings very oddly most</text>
  <text start="457.81" dur="5.52">of them we realize our complete false</text>
  <text start="459.85" dur="5.22">flags to push their agendas and we can</text>
  <text start="463.33" dur="5.94">see the government is becoming more and</text>
  <text start="465.07" dur="8.94">more desperate as we move forward now</text>
  <text start="469.27" dur="7.41">out in South Korea we know the u.s. and</text>
  <text start="474.01" dur="5.19">South Korea came up with an agreement to</text>
  <text start="476.68" dur="4.23">have the terminal high altitude area</text>
  <text start="479.2" dur="4.14">defense and they placed it in the</text>
  <text start="480.91" dur="4.98">mountainous region near Seoul in South</text>
  <text start="483.34" dur="5.42">Korea now the United States and South</text>
  <text start="485.89" dur="5.52">Korea saying well North Korea is</text>
  <text start="488.76" dur="5.53">operating more than a thousand missiles</text>
  <text start="491.41" dur="7.28">and the 48 interceptors that we placed</text>
  <text start="494.29" dur="8.04">in South Korea it&amp;#39;s not enough we need</text>
  <text start="498.69" dur="7.23">more so now they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="502.33" dur="7.32">bringing in more of these interceptors</text>
  <text start="505.92" dur="6.4">out in Sudan we see the president is</text>
  <text start="509.65" dur="5.69">ready to send in two hundred US forces</text>
  <text start="512.32" dur="5.79">now they&amp;#39;re on standby in Uganda and</text>
  <text start="515.34" dur="4.66">they&amp;#39;re ready to go into South Sudan at</text>
  <text start="518.11" dur="4.14">a moment&amp;#39;s notice so it looks like we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="520" dur="4.71">be bringing a lot more troops into this</text>
  <text start="522.25" dur="5.15">region I know they brought in and what</text>
  <text start="524.71" dur="5.25">like 54 so to help out with the</text>
  <text start="527.4" dur="5.77">personnel in the embassy but it looks</text>
  <text start="529.96" dur="6.72">like now they&amp;#39;re getting ready to bring</text>
  <text start="533.17" dur="7.25">in more forces into the area to garrison</text>
  <text start="536.68" dur="7.62">the country to protect their assets</text>
  <text start="540.42" dur="6.64">which is the oil and we can see this is</text>
  <text start="544.3" dur="6.03">happening to each and every one of the</text>
  <text start="547.06" dur="7.65">countries they decided to go into back</text>
  <text start="550.33" dur="7.35">in two thousand one where General Wesley</text>
  <text start="554.71" dur="5.04">Clark came out with his list said this</text>
  <text start="557.68" dur="4.59">will be completed by 2008 well have Iran</text>
  <text start="559.75" dur="4.08">will have Syria well have Lebanon will</text>
  <text start="562.27" dur="5.52">have Libya will have</text>
  <text start="563.83" dur="7.05">we&amp;#39;ll have Sudan we&amp;#39;ll have a rack all</text>
  <text start="567.79" dur="6.84">these countries right now the whole</text>
  <text start="570.88" dur="6.06">things falling apart the u.s. now needs</text>
  <text start="574.63" dur="5.16">to go back into these countries to</text>
  <text start="576.94" dur="4.86">maintain control because the people in</text>
  <text start="579.79" dur="3.99">each one of these countries are saying</text>
  <text start="581.8" dur="6.54">you know something we&amp;#39;re done with this</text>
  <text start="583.78" dur="7.5">in Ukraine where the US had another coup</text>
  <text start="588.34" dur="6.6">d&amp;#39;etat we see that is not going well</text>
  <text start="591.28" dur="5.82">actually Russia&amp;#39;s FSB Security Service</text>
  <text start="594.94" dur="3.84">said on Monday it caught an employee of</text>
  <text start="597.1" dur="4.67">the Organization for Security and</text>
  <text start="598.78" dur="6.24">Cooperation in Europe spying for Ukraine</text>
  <text start="601.77" dur="5.02">passing sensitive military information</text>
  <text start="605.02" dur="5.25">about what is happening in the</text>
  <text start="606.79" dur="7.11">southeastern section of Ukraine it has</text>
  <text start="610.27" dur="7.08">clear evidence that they were working</text>
  <text start="613.9" dur="6.42">for Kiev and we know that Kiev right now</text>
  <text start="617.35" dur="7.59">is probing the contact line moving</text>
  <text start="620.32" dur="8.33">closer and closer to these regions we</text>
  <text start="624.94" dur="6.21">see that the u.s. Ukraine Germany</text>
  <text start="628.65" dur="5.26">they&amp;#39;re going to be flying over each of</text>
  <text start="631.15" dur="5.76">their countries using the Open Skies</text>
  <text start="633.91" dur="5.43">treaty so the US and Ukrainian pilots</text>
  <text start="636.91" dur="4.71">will perform a joint observation flight</text>
  <text start="639.34" dur="4.98">over Russia while the Russian observers</text>
  <text start="641.62" dur="5.1">will fly over Germany and of course when</text>
  <text start="644.32" dur="4.65">they fly over Russia they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="646.72" dur="4.29">see there&amp;#39;s no troop buildups they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="648.97" dur="3.99">going to see Russia&amp;#39;s not getting ready</text>
  <text start="651.01" dur="3.36">to invade but of course the corporate</text>
  <text start="652.96" dur="2.85">media the propaganda is going to be out</text>
  <text start="654.37" dur="3.6">there saying that they&amp;#39;re ready to</text>
  <text start="655.81" dur="3.96">invade they&amp;#39;re ready to go into the</text>
  <text start="657.97" dur="3.95">country but of course they&amp;#39;ll never show</text>
  <text start="659.77" dur="4.17">any proof because it&amp;#39;s all propaganda</text>
  <text start="661.92" dur="7.81">because what they&amp;#39;re getting ready for</text>
  <text start="663.94" dur="6.96">is another offensive because the central</text>
  <text start="669.73" dur="3.57">bank&amp;#39;s they still didn&amp;#39;t get what they</text>
  <text start="670.9" dur="5.99">paid for they didn&amp;#39;t complete the mints</text>
  <text start="673.3" dur="7.17">to cease fire agreement and we can see</text>
  <text start="676.89" dur="5.86">the US and the and other forces the UK</text>
  <text start="680.47" dur="5.7">poulan they&amp;#39;ve been bringing in lethal</text>
  <text start="682.75" dur="6.93">weapons they&amp;#39;ve been training the armed</text>
  <text start="686.17" dur="7.26">forces in Ukraine all for one reason and</text>
  <text start="689.68" dur="6.12">one reason only and we&amp;#39;re just waiting</text>
  <text start="693.43" dur="4.09">for the big bang to go off and that</text>
  <text start="695.8" dur="4">should be coming up very</text>
  <text start="697.52" dur="4.86">very soon now on Friday July fifteenth</text>
  <text start="699.8" dur="6.09">there was a coup in Turkey and we</text>
  <text start="702.38" dur="6.75">discussed this over the weekend and we</text>
  <text start="705.89" dur="8.88">have to think to ourselves why did this</text>
  <text start="709.13" dur="11.37">happen at this point I mean think about</text>
  <text start="714.77" dur="7.44">it why was there a coup and we can see</text>
  <text start="720.5" dur="5.49">many other countries around the world</text>
  <text start="722.21" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re putting up travel alert saying</text>
  <text start="725.99" dur="4.77">do not go to Turkey at this time it is</text>
  <text start="728.3" dur="3.75">very dangerous and many countries are</text>
  <text start="730.76" dur="7.32">looking to get their people out of</text>
  <text start="732.05" dur="10.89">Turkey but when we look at turkeys</text>
  <text start="738.08" dur="6.81">official version of the coup they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="742.94" dur="7.95">saying that there was a small military</text>
  <text start="744.89" dur="8.58">faction and it was controlled by Gulen</text>
  <text start="750.89" dur="6.75">who lives in Pennsylvania who is a CIA</text>
  <text start="753.47" dur="5.97">asset by the way and we can see that</text>
  <text start="757.64" dur="7.76">everything is being blamed on him right</text>
  <text start="759.44" dur="9.66">now and right now berta one is</text>
  <text start="765.4" dur="5.92">completely purging his country but when</text>
  <text start="769.1" dur="5.49">we look at the details of what has</text>
