  <text start="87.19" dur="3.42">market right now is completely</text>
  <text start="88.69" dur="3.75">manipulated to keep all eyes off of what</text>
  <text start="90.61" dur="4.08">is really happening in the economy and</text>
  <text start="92.44" dur="4.95">in the meantime what the Fed is doing it</text>
  <text start="94.69" dur="4.5">is basically setting everything up for</text>
  <text start="97.39" dur="4.35">this gigantic crash and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="99.19" dur="5.64">doing right now is they&amp;#39;re removing a</text>
  <text start="101.74" dur="5.55">lot of the tools they&amp;#39;ve used to</text>

  <text start="110.8" dur="3.87">are telling you this they keep that on</text>
  <text start="112.81" dur="3.419">the side because they know exactly what</text>
  <text start="114.67" dur="3.54">is happening in the economy they know</text>
  <text start="116.229" dur="3.481">exactly when a recession is coming but</text>
  <text start="118.21" dur="3.54">what they&amp;#39;re broadcasting out to the</text>
  <text start="119.71" dur="3.689">public is don&amp;#39;t worry we see nothing</text>
  <text start="121.75" dur="3.479">everything is great put your money in</text>
  <text start="123.399" dur="4.201">the market put your money in real estate</text>
  <text start="125.229" dur="3.871">put your money over here up to the very</text>
  <text start="127.6" dur="3.39">last minute and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="129.1" dur="4.469">everything falls apart and they say wow</text>
  <text start="130.99" dur="4.59">where this come from we have no clue and</text>
  <text start="133.569" dur="5.071">what is happening right now a lot of</text>
  <text start="135.58" dur="5.01">financial analysts a lot of individuals</text>
  <text start="138.64" dur="3.39">corporations they&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="140.59" dur="3">economy and they&amp;#39;re going back eight</text>
  <text start="142.03" dur="3.51">years and they&amp;#39;re saying well you know</text>
  <text start="143.59" dur="3.6">something&amp;#39;s not right we&amp;#39;re seeing all</text>
  <text start="145.54" dur="3.15">these different things occur but the</text>
  <text start="147.19" dur="2.879">market keeps going up we&amp;#39;re not seeing</text>
  <text start="148.69" dur="3.12">the sales when I&amp;#39;ve seen the revenue</text>
  <text start="150.069" dur="3.631">we&amp;#39;re not seeing the tax receipts</text>
  <text start="151.81" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re networking retail closed down</text>
  <text start="153.7" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;re seeing housing hitting the top now</text>
  <text start="156.1" dur="3.69">everything&amp;#39;s starting to move down and</text>
  <text start="157.51" dur="4.92">something is wrong so one of these</text>
  <text start="159.79" dur="5.07">individuals tom kean he created an</text>
  <text start="162.43" dur="6.24">indicator that tells us the breadth of</text>
  <text start="164.86" dur="5.58">the market now while a job as we know is</text>
  <text start="168.67" dur="4.17">a job I mean you could just say yes</text>
  <text start="170.44" dur="3.93">there are jobs out there but then you</text>
  <text start="172.84" dur="4.05">have to go a little bit deeper and you</text>
  <text start="174.37" dur="5.52">need to find out what type of job it</text>
  <text start="176.89" dur="4.68">really is because each job is completely</text>
  <text start="179.89" dur="3.51">different each job has a different</text>
  <text start="181.57" dur="4.47">strengths each job pays a different</text>
  <text start="183.4" dur="3.78">amount each job is either a part-time</text>
  <text start="186.04" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s a temporary</text>
  <text start="187.18" dur="4.83">job is a full-time job and he went and</text>
  <text start="190.06" dur="5.22">he looked at this and he said well we</text>
  <text start="192.01" dur="9.36">have major problems here</text>
  <text start="195.28" dur="8.069">now if total growth is strong but is the</text>
  <text start="201.37" dur="5.759">result of only a few sectors the breadth</text>
  <text start="203.349" dur="7.441">of the oval the overall market is weak</text>
  <text start="207.129" dur="6.121">now this typically provides us with a</text>
  <text start="210.79" dur="6.029">signal on where the overall market is</text>
  <text start="213.25" dur="5.7">heading now this brings us to this</text>
  <text start="216.819" dur="5.461">indicator that he built over the past</text>
  <text start="218.95" dur="5.67">years and it is the labor market breadth</text>
  <text start="222.28" dur="5.489">which seeks to measure the aggregate</text>
  <text start="224.62" dur="7.08">health of the labor market by looking at</text>
  <text start="227.769" dur="6.06">all different subcomponents so as we</text>
  <text start="231.7" dur="4.319">know Friday the employment numbers came</text>
  <text start="233.829" dur="4.13">out the report showed that there were</text>
  <text start="236.019" dur="3.961">two hundred nine thousand new jobs</text>
  <text start="237.959" dur="4.78">beating estimates of one hundred and</text>
  <text start="239.98" dur="5.28">eighty three and the labor market</text>
  <text start="242.739" dur="4.17">breadth fell to an unsafe cycle low and</text>
  <text start="245.26" dur="4.08">when you look at the graph that he</text>
  <text start="246.909" dur="5.79">provided yes this is exactly what has</text>
  <text start="249.34" dur="5.579">happened so the headline numbers as they</text>
  <text start="252.699" dur="4.38">always normally are they make them look</text>
  <text start="254.919" dur="4.021">great they massage them they tell you</text>
  <text start="257.079" dur="4.951">things are fantastic they look strong</text>
  <text start="258.94" dur="7.8">but the subcomponents well they all</text>
  <text start="262.03" dur="8.4">continues to slow which is not in good</text>
  <text start="266.74" dur="6.87">sign a good indicator of strength in the</text>
  <text start="270.43" dur="4.769">market now we can definitely see this in</text>
  <text start="273.61" dur="4.44">retail and he points this out in this</text>
  <text start="275.199" dur="5.371">chart and during the height of the</text>
  <text start="278.05" dur="7.25">market we were seeing retail trade</text>
  <text start="280.57" dur="6.8">around two to three percent we are below</text>
  <text start="285.3" dur="3.91">zero right now</text>
  <text start="287.37" dur="5.019">actually during the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="289.21" dur="5.4">right before the Great Recession hit we</text>
  <text start="292.389" dur="4.411">were hitting around two percent and we</text>
  <text start="294.61" dur="5.339">dropped to negative six percent so right</text>
  <text start="296.8" dur="7.35">now in this incredible recovery that</text>
  <text start="299.949" dur="7.381">they started back in 2009 we are below</text>
  <text start="304.15" dur="6.509">zero right now that doesn&amp;#39;t make any</text>
  <text start="307.33" dur="7.38">sense and if we look at other</text>
  <text start="310.659" dur="5.911">information we can see that again this</text>
  <text start="314.71" dur="4.91">follows through like arts entertainment</text>
  <text start="316.57" dur="4.819">recreation again at</text>
  <text start="319.62" dur="5.06">height of the market before the Great</text>
  <text start="321.389" dur="8.791">Recession what do we see we were around</text>
  <text start="324.68" dur="7.38">4% where are we today we are at 1% and</text>
  <text start="330.18" dur="3.93">remember all these trajectories are</text>
  <text start="332.06" dur="5.29">heading downward they&amp;#39;re declining</text>
  <text start="334.11" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re not moving up healthcare which</text>
  <text start="337.35" dur="2.069">has slowed materially over the past four</text>
  <text start="339.06" dur="2.79">months</text>
  <text start="339.419" dur="6.331">well again at the height of the market</text>
  <text start="341.85" dur="6.99">we are around 3% we are now declining</text>
  <text start="345.75" dur="5.61">and we&amp;#39;re at 2% now remember Obamacare</text>
  <text start="348.84" dur="4.41">boosted this up to make us believe and</text>
  <text start="351.36" dur="3.24">think that everything was great they</text>
  <text start="353.25" dur="3.93">were able to manipulate the numbers and</text>
  <text start="354.6" dur="4.59">they kept doing this and now since</text>
  <text start="357.18" dur="3.989">there&amp;#39;s no manipulation you can see what</text>
  <text start="359.19" dur="4.65">is happening now again we saw the</text>
  <text start="361.169" dur="3.271">exchanges the co-ops they were all going</text>
  <text start="363.84" dur="2.579">bust</text>
  <text start="364.44" dur="4.05">they were completely imploding on</text>
  <text start="366.419" dur="3.961">themselves and this is going to continue</text>
  <text start="368.49" dur="3.179">to happen because people are looking at</text>
  <text start="370.38" dur="3.21">health care saying listen I just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="371.669" dur="3.991">afford this why can&amp;#39;t they for this</text>
  <text start="373.59" dur="4.53">because they don&amp;#39;t have the income they</text>
  <text start="375.66" dur="6.9">don&amp;#39;t have the jobs and when we look at</text>
  <text start="378.12" dur="6.75">wages and salaries well what what we are</text>
  <text start="382.56" dur="3.6">seeing right now once again when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="384.87" dur="3.84">looking at the labor market breadth</text>
  <text start="386.16" dur="5.46">we&amp;#39;re starting to see or we have been</text>
  <text start="388.71" dur="6.6">seeing it for a long time that wages and</text>
  <text start="391.62" dur="6.12">salaries are dropping now there is a</text>
  <text start="395.31" dur="6.539">six-month lag on this but when we look</text>
  <text start="397.74" dur="5.609">back in time we can see that according</text>
  <text start="401.849" dur="5.79">to the scale right before the Great</text>
  <text start="403.349" dur="6.841">Recession we were at 90 percent during</text>
  <text start="407.639" dur="5.641">2008 it dropped down to 60 percent and</text>
  <text start="410.19" dur="6.39">then boom it went down all the way to 5</text>
  <text start="413.28" dur="6.98">percent the Fed was able to pump this</text>
  <text start="416.58" dur="7.29">back up to 90 percent we are now around</text>
  <text start="420.26" dur="7.12">25 percent and dropping fast so this</text>
  <text start="423.87" dur="6.78">tells us that the labor market breadth</text>
  <text start="427.38" dur="5.73">the breadth of the market well it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="430.65" dur="5.28">doing well now something very</text>
  <text start="433.11" dur="5.489">interesting happened today and we can</text>
  <text start="435.93" dur="6.75">see that the Fed is definitely setting</text>
  <text start="438.599" dur="7.171">it up and trying to hide all of their</text>
  <text start="442.68" dur="4.82">information all their indicators</text>
  <text start="445.77" dur="4.41">everything that they&amp;#39;re looking at and</text>
  <text start="447.5" dur="5.11">they&amp;#39;re trying to say we don&amp;#39;t need it</text>
  <text start="450.18" dur="4.109">anymore now this is very interesting now</text>
  <text start="452.61" dur="4.109">this indicator and we&amp;#39;ve looked at this</text>
  <text start="454.289" dur="4.741">before in other reports and I hate to</text>
  <text start="456.719" dur="4.621">say it it&amp;#39;s been very accurate but they</text>
  <text start="459.03" dur="5.22">don&amp;#39;t publicize this out in the</text>
  <text start="461.34" dur="4.44">mainstream media they kind of keep this</text>
  <text start="464.25" dur="3.24">hidden in the background they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="465.78" dur="4.409">really refer to it and it&amp;#39;s the Fed</text>
  <text start="467.49" dur="4.47">labor market condition index and when we</text>
  <text start="470.189" dur="5.1">look at it we can see that they can</text>
  <text start="471.96" dur="6.419">accurately predict when a recession is</text>
  <text start="475.289" dur="6">going to hit and they&amp;#39;ve done this going</text>
  <text start="478.379" dur="6.121">all the way back into the 80s they used</text>
  <text start="481.289" dur="5.761">it in the 90s they used it in 2001 they</text>
  <text start="484.5" dur="3.96">used it in 2008 and when you look at</text>
  <text start="487.05" dur="4.739">this you can see that yes recession</text>
  <text start="488.46" dur="5.79">recession recession recession now the</text>
  <text start="491.789" dur="5.791">Fed is out there and they are saying</text>
  <text start="494.25" dur="7.319">well you know something we really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="497.58" dur="7.47">need this tool anymore it really doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="501.569" dur="6.63">work there&amp;#39;s no reason for it it looks</text>
  <text start="505.05" dur="6.119">like the government they have the data</text>
  <text start="508.199" dur="5.07">so we really don&amp;#39;t need this now to me</text>
  <text start="511.169" dur="4.651">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="513.269" dur="4.861">basically getting rid of all the tools</text>
  <text start="515.82" dur="4.019">that actually show what the real economy</text>
  <text start="518.13" dur="3.63">is doing just like they didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="519.839" dur="4.08">show the money supply anymore what they</text>
  <text start="521.76" dur="4.56">start to do is they start to hide all</text>
  <text start="523.919" dur="5.391">these things so you really don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="526.32" dur="6.269">what&amp;#39;s going on now of course those in</text>
  <text start="529.31" dur="5.11">government they&amp;#39;re putting out this fake</text>
  <text start="532.589" dur="3.24">data now the Fed is going to say well</text>
  <text start="534.42" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;ve been just going along with this</text>
  <text start="535.829" dur="5.521">data and this is the same data that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="538.35" dur="6.75">been used since going all the way back</text>
  <text start="541.35" dur="5.46">and it&amp;#39;s been manipulated since 2008 so</text>
  <text start="545.1" dur="4.44">you can see what they&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="546.81" dur="5.459">they&amp;#39;re setting all of this up and</text>
  <text start="549.54" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re going to say hey listen we have</text>
  <text start="552.269" dur="4.291">been just following what the government</text>
  <text start="554.67" dur="3.539">has been saying they&amp;#39;ve been feeding us</text>
  <text start="556.56" dur="3.63">the employment numbers they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="558.209" dur="3.271">feeding us the GDP numbers they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="560.19" dur="3.509">feeding us all this information and</text>
  <text start="561.48" dur="4.109">they&amp;#39;re telling us from their</text>
  <text start="563.699" dur="3.871">statistical information that everything</text>
  <text start="565.589" dur="3.631">is fine we don&amp;#39;t have our indicators</text>
  <text start="567.57" dur="3.3">anymore because we felt we didn&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="569.22" dur="3.21">them anymore because the government was</text>
  <text start="570.87" dur="3.51">doing such a great job so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="572.43" dur="3.45">already setting this up now remember the</text>
  <text start="574.38" dur="3.329">Federal Reserve has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="575.88" dur="4.47">the government they&amp;#39;re separate and</text>
  <text start="577.709" dur="5.88">apart they&amp;#39;re a standalone corporation</text>
  <text start="580.35" dur="5.589">and again they know this system is</text>
  <text start="583.589" dur="4.84">coming down then</text>
  <text start="585.939" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s falling apart and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="588.429" dur="5.1">to be blamed for this so they&amp;#39;re setting</text>
  <text start="590.439" dur="5.73">this up to blame another entity another</text>
  <text start="593.529" dur="3.99">person or maybe another country so we</text>
  <text start="596.169" dur="4.11">can see this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="597.519" dur="5.1">doing now there is a new study that is</text>
  <text start="600.279" dur="5.25">out there and they studied the Great</text>
  <text start="602.619" dur="5.13">Recession which by the way we&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="605.529" dur="5.31">in we&amp;#39;re in a recession we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="607.749" dur="7.8">into a depression and what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="610.839" dur="7.77">looking at is that well we really never</text>
  <text start="615.549" dur="6">got out of the Great Recession now the</text>
  <text start="618.609" dur="5.09">Great Recession was unprecedented in</text>
  <text start="621.549" dur="4.83">terms of severity of its impact on and</text>
  <text start="623.699" dur="6.37">duration of the impact for any period</text>
  <text start="626.379" dur="6.12">since 1947 the Great Recession is the</text>
  <text start="630.069" dur="5.07">only period in the u.s. modern history</text>
  <text start="632.499" dur="5.34">when the long-term trend path of real</text>
  <text start="635.139" dur="5.67">GDP per capita shifted permanently below</text>
  <text start="637.839" dur="5.97">historical trend now the Roosevelt</text>

  <text start="683.259" dur="5.73">this new trend that they&amp;#39;re seeing well</text>
  <text start="686.739" dur="6">everything is declining and getting</text>

  <text start="699.189" dur="6.84">permanently lower output and income and</text>
  <text start="702.339" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;re stating that we&amp;#39;ve never escaped</text>
  <text start="706.029" dur="4.56">the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="707.679" dur="6.24">there has been no improvement in the</text>
  <text start="710.589" dur="6.99">economy whatsoever this economy has been</text>
  <text start="713.919" dur="5.97">built on stimulus it&amp;#39;s not by the people</text>
  <text start="717.579" dur="5.13">it&amp;#39;s not by man you</text>
  <text start="719.889" dur="5.94">factoring it&amp;#39;s not by producing and</text>
  <text start="722.709" dur="7.35">exporting it was created and maintained</text>
  <text start="725.829" dur="6.81">only on stimulus it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="730.059" dur="6.77">looking at someone that works out and</text>
  <text start="732.639" dur="8.401">instead of doing it naturally using food</text>
  <text start="736.829" dur="7.66">using weights working out everyday they</text>
  <text start="741.04" dur="7.529">decide to take steroids and they use</text>
  <text start="744.489" dur="6.87">this drug and they use it for a long</text>
  <text start="748.569" dur="5.01">period of time and it looks great but</text>
  <text start="751.359" dur="4.77">what happens is you end up with</text>
  <text start="753.579" dur="6.151">complications it starts to backfire on</text>
  <text start="756.129" dur="6.21">you things start to happen to your body</text>
  <text start="759.73" dur="5.189">this is what&amp;#39;s happening in the economy</text>
  <text start="762.339" dur="5.46">it looks great we&amp;#39;ve been on these</text>
  <text start="764.919" dur="7.29">steroids for this period of time</text>
  <text start="767.799" dur="9">well now we&amp;#39;re starting to see all the</text>
  <text start="772.209" dur="7.59">problems of these steroids appear and as</text>
  <text start="776.799" dur="6.06">it appears and as we continually break</text>
  <text start="779.799" dur="7.681">down it&amp;#39;s just going to get worse this</text>
  <text start="782.859" dur="6.501">is why the central banks around the</text>
  <text start="787.48" dur="4.319">world this is why they&amp;#39;re discontinuing</text>
  <text start="789.36" dur="4.12">stimulus this is why they&amp;#39;re making this</text>
  <text start="791.799" dur="2.85">announcement they might be doing it</text>
  <text start="793.48" dur="2.969">covertly because they know if they</text>
  <text start="794.649" dur="3.84">completely remove it the whole system</text>
  <text start="796.449" dur="4.771">just falls apart because they realize</text>
  <text start="798.489" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;ve used stimulus to the max right</text>
  <text start="801.22" dur="6.419">now and they know it&amp;#39;s having no effect</text>
  <text start="803.379" dur="6.06">on the economy whatsoever and if the</text>
  <text start="807.639" dur="3.06">government and the governments around</text>
  <text start="809.439" dur="3.12">the world are coming out with their</text>
  <text start="810.699" dur="4.62">statistical numbers showing that the</text>
  <text start="812.559" dur="5.58">economy is at almost full employment and</text>
  <text start="815.319" dur="5.58">the economy looks great people are</text>
  <text start="818.139" dur="7.88">wondering why do we still have stimulus</text>
  <text start="820.899" dur="7.62">if the economy is completely fine and</text>
  <text start="826.019" dur="4.63">this is why they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="828.519" dur="4.11">unwinding this is why they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="830.649" dur="3.54">about raising the interest rates this is</text>
  <text start="832.629" dur="3.9">why they&amp;#39;re talking about all this and</text>
  <text start="834.189" dur="6.3">again this is a lot of talk because they</text>
  <text start="836.529" dur="5.67">realize the world is saying okay what is</text>
  <text start="840.489" dur="4.981">going on here right now we&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="842.199" dur="4.92">stimulus for you know eight years now do</text>
  <text start="845.47" dur="3.149">we still need it now of course the Fed</text>
  <text start="847.119" dur="2.13">is coming on say no we don&amp;#39;t need it</text>
  <text start="848.619" dur="3.21">anymore</text>
  <text start="849.249" dur="4.501">but it looks like they are maneuvering</text>
  <text start="851.829" dur="3.661">to set it up to show</text>
  <text start="853.75" dur="3.45">that hey it wasn&amp;#39;t our fault that the</text>
  <text start="855.49" dur="3.87">economy came down it must have been</text>
  <text start="857.2" dur="3.51">Trump it must have been Russia it must</text>
  <text start="859.36" dur="4.11">have been China it must have been</text>
  <text start="860.71" dur="4.14">everyone else except the central banking</text>
  <text start="863.47" dur="3.3">system because what they want to do is</text>
  <text start="864.85" dur="5.52">they want to restart this entire system</text>
  <text start="866.77" dur="6.42">now China&amp;#39;s reserves they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="870.37" dur="5.22">declining as capital outflows accelerate</text>
  <text start="873.19" dur="4.44">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a lot of</text>
  <text start="875.59" dur="6.39">countries they&amp;#39;re starting to remove</text>
  <text start="877.63" dur="7.92">their reserve dollars from their banking</text>
  <text start="881.98" dur="5.85">system and the reason for this is</text>
  <text start="885.55" dur="4.38">because they&amp;#39;re they don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="887.83" dur="4.05">exposed to the dollar when it goes down</text>
  <text start="889.93" dur="3.36">and we can see this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="891.88" dur="3.3">selling off some Treasuries yes they</text>
  <text start="893.29" dur="3.81">purchase some Treasuries but they sell</text>
  <text start="895.18" dur="3.48">it off and they purchase gold Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="897.1" dur="5.43">doing the same thing they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="898.66" dur="5.64">trading not using the dollar so they</text>
  <text start="902.53" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t really need the dollar for trade</text>
  <text start="904.3" dur="3.3">they don&amp;#39;t need to purchase oil and this</text>
  <text start="906.28" dur="2.52">is another reason why the dollar is</text>
  <text start="907.6" dur="2.91">going to come floating back to United</text>
  <text start="908.8" dur="3.66">States because a lot of countries don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="910.51" dur="3.93">need this dollar so we&amp;#39;re already seeing</text>
  <text start="912.46" dur="4.47">this trend and it&amp;#39;s continuing it has</text>
  <text start="914.44" dur="4.649">not stopped whatsoever because what</text>
  <text start="916.93" dur="4.02">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this complete</text>
  <text start="919.089" dur="4.261">set up the Fed is setting it up they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="920.95" dur="4.44">just continuing their tools we can see</text>
  <text start="923.35" dur="5.4">that this new study is showing that yeah</text>
  <text start="925.39" dur="5.94">we&amp;#39;ve never recovered whatsoever it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="928.75" dur="4.02">one gigantic illusion and from</text>
  <text start="931.33" dur="3.24">everything that we&amp;#39;re looking at at all</text>
  <text start="932.77" dur="3.72">these different indicators the only</text>
  <text start="934.57" dur="5.7">thing the Fed has going for them right</text>
  <text start="936.49" dur="5.22">now is the stock market and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="940.27" dur="2.85">using this for a very long time the</text>
  <text start="941.71" dur="3.72">corporate media has been using this very</text>
  <text start="943.12" dur="4.77">for a very long time saying that this is</text>
  <text start="945.43" dur="4.08">the breadth of the market and we know</text>
  <text start="947.89" dur="2.1">that this is not the breadth of the</text>
  <text start="949.51" dur="2.31">market</text>
  <text start="949.99" dur="3.06">we know that this is one gigantic</text>
  <text start="951.82" dur="4.14">illusion and when this whole thing falls</text>
  <text start="953.05" dur="5.039">apart well it&amp;#39;s going to be disaster now</text>
  <text start="955.96" dur="4.2">the market might never fall apart think</text>
  <text start="958.089" dur="4.411">about this for a second it might keep</text>
  <text start="960.16" dur="4.86">going up and up and up but we might see</text>
  <text start="962.5" dur="4.26">another thousand retail stores closed we</text>
  <text start="965.02" dur="4.14">might see corporations lay off even more</text>
  <text start="966.76" dur="3.9">people we might see strip malls closed</text>
  <text start="969.16" dur="3.78">we might see commercial real estate</text>
  <text start="970.66" dur="5.28">we&amp;#39;re these large buildings they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="972.94" dur="5.91">completely vacant this is a sign that</text>
  <text start="975.94" dur="6.12">the economy is continually deteriorating</text>
  <text start="978.85" dur="4.859">you might see the food stamp money going</text>
  <text start="982.06" dur="3.6">out to individuals where they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="983.709" dur="4.411">on more saying instead of 47 million it</text>
  <text start="985.66" dur="5.82">might go up to 60 million they might go</text>
  <text start="988.12" dur="5.159">to 80 million and this is another signal</text>
  <text start="991.48" dur="4.5">that the economy is collapsing the</text>
  <text start="993.279" dur="4.471">market has no bearing on what the</text>
  <text start="995.98" dur="3.63">economy is doing and this is why you</text>
  <text start="997.75" dur="5.01">need to get prepared because it&amp;#39;s going</text>
