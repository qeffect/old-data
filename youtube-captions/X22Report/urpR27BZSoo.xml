  <text start="114.76" dur="8.039">and now in the UK we are seeing there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="118.63" dur="8.4">a problem and this usually shows up when</text>
  <text start="122.799" dur="8.121">people can&amp;#39;t get by where families out</text>
  <text start="127.03" dur="7.32">there are boring at a very fast rate</text>

  <text start="144.76" dur="5.97">than ever now what&amp;#39;s worrying about this</text>
  <text start="147.97" dur="7.92">is this usually happens and is usually a</text>
  <text start="150.73" dur="8.19">sign when the economy is deteriorating</text>
  <text start="155.89" dur="5.4">people have to live they have to buy</text>
  <text start="158.92" dur="4.5">food they have to pay for certain things</text>
  <text start="161.29" dur="3.99">and they put it on the credit card</text>
  <text start="163.42" dur="6.27">because they don&amp;#39;t have currency readily</text>
  <text start="165.28" dur="7.23">available the problem is is that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="169.69" dur="5.54">no funds to pay for all of this and this</text>
  <text start="172.51" dur="5.4">is where people get into trouble and</text>
  <text start="175.23" dur="4.119">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this is</text>
  <text start="177.91" dur="3.46">starting to spread not just in the UK</text>
  <text start="179.349" dur="5.621">but also the United States</text>
  <text start="181.37" dur="6.81">we saw it happen back in 2008-2009 going</text>
  <text start="184.97" dur="5.46">forward where people didn&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="188.18" dur="5.19">currency lost their jobs and they</text>
  <text start="190.43" dur="6.449">started to use their credit cards I mean</text>
  <text start="193.37" dur="6.119">this happens and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="196.879" dur="5.701">this right now we see the illusion of</text>
  <text start="199.489" dur="6.181">the economy is continuing the initial</text>
  <text start="202.58" dur="6.299">jobless claims well it&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re at a very</text>
  <text start="205.67" dur="6.539">very low level right now claims plunge</text>
  <text start="208.879" dur="4.801">to twenty eight thousand to about two</text>
  <text start="212.209" dur="4.831">hundred and thirty-five thousand this is</text>
  <text start="213.68" dur="6.419">the second lowest print since 1973 but</text>
  <text start="217.04" dur="4.86">continuing jobless claims they rose once</text>
  <text start="220.099" dur="4.95">again to the highest since the beginning</text>
  <text start="221.9" dur="8.13">of September and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="225.049" dur="7.711">now is that these numbers are once again</text>
  <text start="230.03" dur="5.819">manipulate remember those individuals</text>
  <text start="232.76" dur="5.28">who lose their job in retail let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="235.849" dur="5.161">and they&amp;#39;re only working twenty-five</text>
  <text start="238.04" dur="6.12">hours or less a week and an old depends</text>
  <text start="241.01" dur="5.91">on each state and they&amp;#39;re not earning a</text>
  <text start="244.16" dur="9.24">certain dollar amount they can&amp;#39;t apply</text>
  <text start="246.92" dur="9">for the unemployment insurance so if you</text>
  <text start="253.4" dur="6.839">here fifteen thousand twenty thousand</text>
  <text start="255.92" dur="7.02">people being laid off in retail most of</text>
  <text start="260.239" dur="5.131">these individuals will not be claiming</text>
  <text start="262.94" dur="6.24">even though they&amp;#39;re counted as a</text>
  <text start="265.37" dur="7.74">full-time job so you can see how they</text>
  <text start="269.18" dur="5.459">play upon this ADP is reporting that the</text>
  <text start="273.11" dur="3.09">economy only added about one hundred</text>
  <text start="274.639" dur="4.46">fifty three thousand jobs they expected</text>
  <text start="276.2" dur="5.61">about 175,000 and manufacturing jobs</text>
  <text start="279.099" dur="6.101">will they continue to slide they&amp;#39;re down</text>
  <text start="281.81" dur="6.12">by nine thousand December construction</text>
  <text start="285.2" dur="6.27">mining jobs they also declined by two</text>
  <text start="287.93" dur="7.41">thousand and five thousand and we could</text>
  <text start="291.47" dur="7.08">see right now jobs are not being added</text>
  <text start="295.34" dur="6.06">the good high-paying jobs they are not</text>
  <text start="298.55" dur="7.11">being added what&amp;#39;s being added are these</text>
  <text start="301.4" dur="6.63">part-time low-paying jobs now yesterday</text>
  <text start="305.66" dur="3.78">we reported on Auto Sales and how the</text>
  <text start="308.03" dur="3.93">corporate media was making a big deal</text>
  <text start="309.44" dur="5.34">but what we&amp;#39;re finding out right now is</text>
  <text start="311.96" dur="8.43">we dive further into these numbers</text>
  <text start="314.78" dur="8.6">well car sales are not as good as what</text>
  <text start="320.39" dur="6.66">the corporate media wants us to believe</text>
  <text start="323.38" dur="9.04">what we see right now is that car sales</text>
  <text start="327.05" dur="9.18">have actually dropped car sales at GM</text>
  <text start="332.42" dur="7.5">dropped by 4.3 percent in 2016 Ford by</text>
  <text start="336.23" dur="5.46">13 percent and Fiat Chrysler well that</text>
  <text start="339.92" dur="5.07">dropped by thirty three point five</text>
  <text start="341.69" dur="7.31">percent plants that build cars were the</text>
  <text start="344.99" dur="6.96">ones mostly hit by shutdowns and layoffs</text>
  <text start="349" dur="6.7">so for all of the big three US</text>
  <text start="351.95" dur="5.39">automakers plus a number of others sales</text>
  <text start="355.7" dur="6.95">in 2016</text>
  <text start="357.34" dur="8.29">actually fell and here&amp;#39;s the breakdown</text>
  <text start="362.65" dur="6.57">GM down negative one point three percent</text>
  <text start="365.63" dur="6.69">Ford down negative point one percent</text>
  <text start="369.22" dur="6.31">Toyota down negative two point two point</text>
  <text start="372.32" dur="5.46">zero percent Volkswagen down negative</text>
  <text start="375.53" dur="4.68">three point three percent BMW down</text>
  <text start="377.78" dur="6.449">negative nine point seven percent mazda</text>
  <text start="380.21" dur="6.48">down negative six point seven percent so</text>
  <text start="384.229" dur="4.771">the sales of these seven automakers</text>
  <text start="386.69" dur="5.039">combined amounted to about eleven point</text>
  <text start="389" dur="7.2">five million vehicles in 2016 or sixty</text>
  <text start="391.729" dur="9.531">five percent of total US sales and the</text>
  <text start="396.2" dur="9.36">combined sales were down 1.5 percent a</text>
  <text start="401.26" dur="7.12">year ago and I guess this is what Ford</text>
  <text start="405.56" dur="5.63">meant when they said we&amp;#39;re heading into</text>
  <text start="408.38" dur="5.97">a car recession now the corporate media</text>
  <text start="411.19" dur="7.45">they&amp;#39;re telling us a different story the</text>
  <text start="414.35" dur="6.17">hard data is shining through and showing</text>
  <text start="418.64" dur="5.279">us something completely different and</text>
  <text start="420.52" dur="8.08">this is the first annual sales decline</text>
  <text start="423.919" dur="6.261">since 2009 and when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="428.6" dur="4.29">can see that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="430.18" dur="5.08">deteriorating very very quickly we see</text>
  <text start="432.89" dur="4.38">the US services economy well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="435.26" dur="6.33">starting to lose momentum services PMI</text>
  <text start="437.27" dur="6.98">is dropping is M services well that is</text>
  <text start="441.59" dur="5.55">dropping and very interestingly and</text>
  <text start="444.25" dur="4.33">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="447.14" dur="4.14">over the holiday season with REIT</text>
  <text start="448.58" dur="4.769">stores and we&amp;#39;ve been putting the pieces</text>
  <text start="451.28" dur="4.05">together saying these unemployment</text>
  <text start="453.349" dur="4.891">numbers cannot be true because it makes</text>
  <text start="455.33" dur="6">no sense the sales of the retail stores</text>
  <text start="458.24" dur="3.979">and even online sales they&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="461.33" dur="4.38">there</text>
  <text start="462.219" dur="6.16">Black Friday Cyber Monday once again was</text>
  <text start="465.71" dur="4.979">a bust and now we&amp;#39;re starting to see the</text>
  <text start="468.379" dur="3.81">real results and I&amp;#39;m not talking about</text>
  <text start="470.689" dur="3.271">the manipulated numbers that the</text>
  <text start="472.189" dur="4.5">government puts out we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="473.96" dur="5.97">numbers directly from the stores that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="476.689" dur="6.151">where the truth lies and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="479.93" dur="5.43">seeing is that stores are starting to</text>
  <text start="482.84" dur="4.74">come out and say you know something</text>
  <text start="485.36" dur="4.709">things are a lot worse than we thought</text>
  <text start="487.58" dur="7.07">Kohl&amp;#39;s they announced that sales were</text>
  <text start="490.069" dur="7.16">down 2.1 percent Macy&amp;#39;s right now well</text>
  <text start="494.65" dur="7.239">they&amp;#39;re going to be laying off about</text>
  <text start="497.229" dur="8.68">10,000 individuals closing 68 Macy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="501.889" dur="7.921">stores and sales once again are down in</text>
  <text start="505.909" dur="6.36">Macy&amp;#39;s Sears they&amp;#39;re announcing the</text>
  <text start="509.81" dur="5.459">second wave of store closures bringing</text>

  <text start="522.589" dur="6.36">stores and the list goes on and on and</text>
  <text start="525.5" dur="7.699">on what we are seeing right now is a</text>
  <text start="528.949" dur="7.14">complete breakdown of the economy</text>
  <text start="533.199" dur="5.561">because if the unemployment numbers were</text>
  <text start="536.089" dur="4.68">true and we were at 4.6 percent where</text>
  <text start="538.76" dur="5.509">people are getting those full-time</text>
  <text start="540.769" dur="6.121">high-paying jobs we would see an</text>
  <text start="544.269" dur="6.461">expansion in retail we would see an</text>
  <text start="546.89" dur="6.569">expansion in real estate we would see an</text>
  <text start="550.73" dur="5.28">expansion in manufacturing we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="553.459" dur="5.301">seeing this we&amp;#39;re seeing a contraction</text>
  <text start="556.01" dur="6.78">the opposite is happening right now and</text>
  <text start="558.76" dur="5.949">this is how we can gauge what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="562.79" dur="4.739">going on now what is happening and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="564.709" dur="6.781">I said this for quite a while is that</text>
  <text start="567.529" dur="6.271">these ridiculous fake illusionary</text>
  <text start="571.49" dur="3.98">statistical numbers that Obama&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="573.8" dur="3.899">putting out the feds been putting out</text>
  <text start="575.47" dur="5.53">the corporate media has been putting out</text>
  <text start="577.699" dur="4.711">they&amp;#39;re going in one direction they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="581" dur="4.079">going to the fake</text>
  <text start="582.41" dur="7.44">world then we&amp;#39;re getting the hard data</text>
  <text start="585.079" dur="7.651">of retail manufacturing we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="589.85" dur="6.419">see moles close down we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="592.73" dur="5.7">strip malls empty I mean we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="596.269" dur="4.831">starting to see this but that is the</text>
  <text start="598.43" dur="4.349">proof I mean just look around your</text>
  <text start="601.1" dur="5.039">neighborhood during the holiday season</text>
  <text start="602.779" dur="6.631">did you see boxes and boxes and and and</text>
  <text start="606.139" dur="6.32">shopping bags all piled up I looked</text>
  <text start="609.41" dur="4.909">around my neighborhood I didn&amp;#39;t see it I</text>
  <text start="612.459" dur="4.601">didn&amp;#39;t see it at all</text>
  <text start="614.319" dur="4.06">actually I was in the malls nobody</text>
  <text start="617.06" dur="3">really even there and I know a lot of</text>
  <text start="618.379" dur="4.171">people well it&amp;#39;s all going to online</text>
  <text start="620.06" dur="4.379">that&amp;#39;s why no what we&amp;#39;re seeing is yes</text>
  <text start="622.55" dur="3.57">maybe people said okay you know what</text>
  <text start="624.439" dur="4.26">instead of going out to the stores I</text>
  <text start="626.12" dur="7.62">went to online but they didn&amp;#39;t increase</text>
  <text start="628.699" dur="6.771">the sales the sales actually dropped so</text>
  <text start="633.74" dur="4.889">all they&amp;#39;re doing is trading off</text>
  <text start="635.47" dur="9.909">brick-and-mortar for online but the</text>
  <text start="638.629" dur="8.551">total sales is declining so everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="645.379" dur="4.471">not moving to online and things are</text>
  <text start="647.18" dur="4.829">getting better we&amp;#39;re just having a move</text>
  <text start="649.85" dur="4.109">movement of where people are shopping</text>
  <text start="652.009" dur="5.43">but they&amp;#39;re shopping less they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="653.959" dur="6.421">purchasing less so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="657.439" dur="5.491">right now is a breakdown of the system</text>
  <text start="660.38" dur="3.78">and this is going to accelerate as we go</text>
  <text start="662.93" dur="3.389">throughout this year we&amp;#39;re going to hear</text>
  <text start="664.16" dur="4.229">a lot more stores closed we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="666.319" dur="5.551">hear the real estate industry start to</text>
  <text start="668.389" dur="6.211">completely break apart and once Trump</text>
  <text start="671.87" dur="4.26">gets into office things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="674.6" dur="4.229">going to accelerate and this is why I do</text>
  <text start="676.13" dur="3.3">believe the elite they can&amp;#39;t wait much</text>
  <text start="678.829" dur="4.021">longer</text>
  <text start="679.43" dur="5.459">the central bank they need to bring down</text>
  <text start="682.85" dur="5.099">the economy now they are looking at the</text>
  <text start="684.889" dur="6.661">situation saying once Trump goes in to</text>
  <text start="687.949" dur="6.63">office and starts digging around finding</text>
  <text start="691.55" dur="4.68">out the truth spreading the word this is</text>
  <text start="694.579" dur="4.651">going to make a major problem unless</text>
  <text start="696.23" dur="4.109">they can shut them up somehow but they</text>
  <text start="699.23" dur="2.88">know they&amp;#39;re going to have to do</text>
  <text start="700.339" dur="5.911">something and we can see plans are</text>
  <text start="702.11" dur="8.31">already in the works we see global debt</text>
  <text start="706.25" dur="9.57">hits 325 percent of world GDP rises to a</text>
  <text start="710.42" dur="9.42">record 217 trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="715.82" dur="6.33">this debt cannot be sustained and while</text>
