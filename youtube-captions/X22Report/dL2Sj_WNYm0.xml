  <text start="88.59" dur="8.55">was to bring down the economy in 2020</text>
  <text start="93.27" dur="7.05">and it seems like this is now being</text>
  <text start="97.14" dur="6.24">confirmed they&amp;#39;re trying to link Trump</text>
  <text start="100.32" dur="6.72">with the economy if the economy fails it</text>

  <text start="114.56" dur="7.18">they still have the ability to bring</text>
  <text start="118.14" dur="5.88">down the system now we know the</text>
  <text start="121.74" dur="5.129">candidates that are running they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="124.02" dur="6.059">really argue with the economy the way it</text>
  <text start="126.869" dur="5.971">is right now Trump is using all their</text>
  <text start="130.079" dur="5.071">weapons against them they can&amp;#39;t mention</text>
  <text start="132.84" dur="4.53">this because all I need to do is turn</text>
  <text start="135.15" dur="3.869">around and saying this is what was given</text>
  <text start="137.37" dur="3.42">to me this is what you&amp;#39;ve been using for</text>
  <text start="139.019" dur="3.331">the last many many years you&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="140.79" dur="4.259">me everything that you used is</text>
  <text start="142.35" dur="4.32">completely wrong this is why they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="145.049" dur="3.121">going to go down this path what I do</text>
  <text start="146.67" dur="3.48">believe they&amp;#39;re going to try to do is</text>
  <text start="148.17" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to bring down the</text>
  <text start="150.15" dur="4.5">economy in 2020 now Q has told us</text>
  <text start="152.79" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;ve already planned for this of</text>
  <text start="154.65" dur="5.13">course they have but this doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="157.29" dur="5.009">they&amp;#39;re not going to try now remember</text>
  <text start="159.78" dur="3.99">the intelligent organizations they have</text>
  <text start="162.299" dur="4.531">malware plan</text>
  <text start="163.77" dur="4.98">in many of the systems we&amp;#39;ve had a</text>
  <text start="166.83" dur="4.68">report that something is going on with</text>
  <text start="168.75" dur="4.46">the Federal Reserve System where it</text>
  <text start="171.51" dur="4.35">might be vulnerable to outside</text>
  <text start="173.21" dur="3.88">influences and we&amp;#39;ll be talking about</text>
  <text start="175.86" dur="2.94">all of this a little bit later in the</text>
  <text start="177.09" dur="3.81">report but first I wanted to start off</text>
  <text start="178.8" dur="5.76">with the economy and we know that this</text>
  <text start="180.9" dur="5.34">economy is run on credit because this is</text>
  <text start="184.56" dur="4.65">the only way the economy can run</text>
  <text start="186.24" dur="7.04">remember it is a central bank economy it</text>
  <text start="189.21" dur="7.17">is created by the central bank to</text>
  <text start="193.28" dur="7.06">implode on itself after a certain period</text>
  <text start="196.38" dur="6.78">of time because their product is debt</text>
  <text start="200.34" dur="5.91">and more and more debt you put out there</text>
  <text start="203.16" dur="6.03">the harder it is for businesses for</text>
  <text start="206.25" dur="6.48">people for the world to function it</text>
  <text start="209.19" dur="5.49">cannot function under the debt load and</text>
  <text start="212.73" dur="3.72">this has been the lie they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="214.68" dur="5.97">feeding us for a very long time that</text>
  <text start="216.45" dur="5.85">debt is good and if you notice going all</text>
  <text start="220.65" dur="4.59">the way back in time to the present day</text>
  <text start="222.3" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;ve gone from no credit to almost</text>
  <text start="225.24" dur="4.35">everyone needing some form of credit to</text>
  <text start="227.55" dur="4.47">get by every single day and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="229.59" dur="3.78">definitely seeing this I mean 70 percent</text>
  <text start="232.02" dur="4.44">of consumers right now with the credit</text>
  <text start="233.37" dur="5.64">card say they can&amp;#39;t pay that that credit</text>
  <text start="236.46" dur="5.34">card off this year it will take many</text>
  <text start="239.01" dur="3.93">many years to pay it off if they can at</text>
  <text start="241.8" dur="4.26">all because remember the interest rates</text>
  <text start="242.94" dur="6.93">on credit cards are very very high but</text>
  <text start="246.06" dur="6.93">more troubling is that 37 million</text>
  <text start="249.87" dur="4.59">Americans had a 90 day delinquent strike</text>
  <text start="252.99" dur="3.66">added to their credit report last</text>
  <text start="254.46" dur="5.39">quarter this is an increase of two</text>
  <text start="256.65" dur="6">million from the fourth quarter of 2017</text>
  <text start="259.85" dur="5.41">these 37 million delinquent accounts</text>
  <text start="262.65" dur="6.26">held roughly 68 billion in debt or</text>
  <text start="265.26" dur="6.84">roughly the market cap of Blackrock Inc</text>
  <text start="268.91" dur="5.65">what is happening here is as the economy</text>
  <text start="272.1" dur="5.37">as the system breaks down people are</text>
  <text start="274.56" dur="6.99">finding it you know harder and harder to</text>
  <text start="277.47" dur="6.18">get by without borrowing money just like</text>
  <text start="281.55" dur="5.25">countries countries cannot function</text>
  <text start="283.65" dur="5.84">unless they borrow this is the way the</text>
  <text start="286.8" dur="5.4">central bankers like it and about 28%</text>
  <text start="289.49" dur="6.1">say they&amp;#39;re fully dependent on credit</text>
  <text start="292.2" dur="5.26">cards to pay rent and utilities we see</text>
  <text start="295.59" dur="3.76">about 30% there</text>
  <text start="297.46" dur="6.299">saying that yes we need it for emergency</text>
  <text start="299.35" dur="8.58">expenses 40% say automobile repairs have</text>
  <text start="303.759" dur="7.681">moved their balance as higher as we can</text>
  <text start="307.93" dur="6.959">see the people of this country and</text>
  <text start="311.44" dur="7.08">around the world they need to borrow to</text>
  <text start="314.889" dur="8.46">survive why the dollar continually loses</text>
  <text start="318.52" dur="8.399">value as the dollar approaches zero the</text>
  <text start="323.349" dur="6.901">dollar amount doesn&amp;#39;t go far you need a</text>
  <text start="326.919" dur="4.981">lot of these dollars to survive so what</text>
  <text start="330.25" dur="3.509">do you have to turn to you need to turn</text>
  <text start="331.9" dur="3.69">to credit because you don&amp;#39;t have access</text>
  <text start="333.759" dur="4.291">to those dollars that unless you borrow</text>
  <text start="335.59" dur="5.609">it and of course there&amp;#39;s interest</text>
  <text start="338.05" dur="5.869">attached now we know the Patriots right</text>
  <text start="341.199" dur="7.171">now they need to keep the system running</text>
  <text start="343.919" dur="6.22">perfectly until the 2020 election and a</text>
  <text start="348.37" dur="5.01">little bit after the 2020 election when</text>
  <text start="350.139" dur="5.131">I say perfectly I mean status quo make</text>
  <text start="353.38" dur="4.77">sure the economy doesn&amp;#39;t fall apart and</text>
  <text start="355.27" dur="4.26">make sure Trump has the ability to</text>
  <text start="358.15" dur="3.69">manipulate the numbers to make the</text>
  <text start="359.53" dur="4.43">economy look great using all the weapons</text>
  <text start="361.84" dur="6.23">against the central bank the deep state</text>
  <text start="363.96" dur="7.42">now Trump did come out and he did say</text>
  <text start="368.07" dur="6.01">that had the Fed not mistakenly raised</text>
  <text start="371.38" dur="4.77">interest rates especially since there is</text>
  <text start="374.08" dur="4.32">very little inflation and they had not</text>
  <text start="376.15" dur="5.1">done the ridiculously ton quantitative</text>
  <text start="378.4" dur="5.1">tightening the 3% GDP in stock market</text>
  <text start="381.25" dur="5.639">would have both much higher and world</text>
  <text start="383.5" dur="6.15">markets would be in a better place he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="386.889" dur="5.191">saying this because he wants to kick the</text>
  <text start="389.65" dur="5.34">can down the street and he needs to do</text>
  <text start="392.08" dur="5.6">this to stay in office long enough to go</text>
  <text start="394.99" dur="6.479">after the central bank now remember</text>
  <text start="397.68" dur="7.269">Trump he has been contradicting the Fed</text>
  <text start="401.469" dur="6.42">almost from day one and he&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="404.949" dur="6.84">doing it if you were looking if you look</text>
  <text start="407.889" dur="7.671">at prior administrations they have</text>
  <text start="411.789" dur="7.891">really never commented on the Fed policy</text>
  <text start="415.56" dur="7.24">but Trump continually does and the</text>
  <text start="419.68" dur="7.109">reason for that is because he&amp;#39;s setting</text>
  <text start="422.8" dur="6.479">up a narrative for later on and the</text>
  <text start="426.789" dur="3.481">White House right now they&amp;#39;re calling on</text>
  <text start="429.279" dur="4.411">the Fed</text>
  <text start="430.27" dur="5.01">to reverse their rate hikes I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="433.69" dur="2.37">feels like this is just right on</text>
  <text start="435.28" dur="4.949">schedule</text>
  <text start="436.06" dur="5.97">now many countries they are still D</text>
  <text start="440.229" dur="3.511">dollar rising when I say D dollar rising</text>
  <text start="442.03" dur="3.509">it doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re getting rid of</text>
  <text start="443.74" dur="4.44">the American dollar this is the Fed</text>
  <text start="445.539" dur="5.1">dollar this is the Fed note they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="448.18" dur="4.98">getting rid of the central bank note</text>
  <text start="450.639" dur="5.521">because they understand and they realize</text>
  <text start="453.16" dur="4.86">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is that is going</text>
  <text start="456.16" dur="3.42">to be absolutely worthless and they</text>
  <text start="458.02" dur="3.09">don&amp;#39;t want to be holding this when</text>
  <text start="459.58" dur="4.14">everything starts to fall apart and</text>
  <text start="461.11" dur="4.41">everything will start to fall apart the</text>
  <text start="463.72" dur="3.87">central bank system is not designed to</text>
  <text start="465.52" dur="3.959">last forever this is why they need</text>
  <text start="467.59" dur="4.29">events this is why they need another</text>
  <text start="469.479" dur="4.201">country to take on the responsibility or</text>
  <text start="471.88" dur="4.5">maybe move it to the IMF or whatever</text>
  <text start="473.68" dur="6.209">they&amp;#39;re going to do and you can see</text>
  <text start="476.38" dur="5.759">right now that the global central bank</text>
  <text start="479.889" dur="6.96">reserves they slumped to their lowest</text>
  <text start="482.139" dur="9.421">since 2013 they&amp;#39;re dumping the dollar</text>
  <text start="486.849" dur="6.781">and adding on the yuan so the US</text>
  <text start="491.56" dur="3.479">currency accounted for 61 point 7</text>
  <text start="493.63" dur="3.39">percent of global allocated foreign</text>
  <text start="495.039" dur="6.12">exchange reserves in the fourth quarter</text>
  <text start="497.02" dur="7.829">down from 60 1.9 percent and the tenth</text>
  <text start="501.159" dur="6.38">decline in the past 12 months so what</text>
  <text start="504.849" dur="5.641">does this tell you this tells you that</text>
  <text start="507.539" dur="5.651">countries they&amp;#39;re looking to dump the</text>
  <text start="510.49" dur="6.479">dollar to protect themselves countries</text>
  <text start="513.19" dur="7.74">they are purchasing gold why to protect</text>
  <text start="516.969" dur="7.86">their wealth and this is perfectly</text>
  <text start="520.93" dur="6.659">normal when you reach the end stage of a</text>
  <text start="524.829" dur="4.95">central bank system I mean if you go</text>
  <text start="527.589" dur="3.81">back in time and you look at when</text>
  <text start="529.779" dur="3.721">Portugal Spain Netherlands France</text>
  <text start="531.399" dur="3.991">Britain u.s. when they were all the</text>
  <text start="533.5" dur="5.37">reserve currencies you can see the</text>
  <text start="535.39" dur="7.83">timeline is about 40 to 50 years and</text>
  <text start="538.87" dur="6.36">then boom it comes to an end and the</text>
  <text start="543.22" dur="4.02">entire system starts all over again</text>
  <text start="545.23" dur="5.25">this is what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="547.24" dur="6.12">you&amp;#39;re watching it in real time there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="550.48" dur="6.39">no event there&amp;#39;s no war there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="553.36" dur="5.7">the central banks can hide behind now</text>
  <text start="556.87" dur="4.2">like we said in the beginning the deep</text>
  <text start="559.06" dur="4.71">state the central banks their entire</text>
  <text start="561.07" dur="5.58">plan revolves around</text>
  <text start="563.77" dur="8.04">the economy right now they need the</text>
  <text start="566.65" dur="7.44">economy to crash why the mullet report</text>
  <text start="571.81" dur="4.53">was a flop when the full report</text>
  <text start="574.09" dur="4.68">eventually comes out it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="576.34" dur="3.6">bigger flop they know this they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="578.77" dur="3.45">have Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="579.94" dur="4.17">they don&amp;#39;t have obstruction what are</text>
  <text start="582.22" dur="4.35">Trump and the Patriots planning to do</text>
  <text start="584.11" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re planning to bring people to</text>
  <text start="586.57" dur="5.07">justice and this is going to happen</text>
  <text start="589.24" dur="6.86">pretty darn soon we&amp;#39;re heading into the</text>
  <text start="591.64" dur="8.43">mid of 2019 right now by the end of 2019</text>
  <text start="596.1" dur="6.46">we&amp;#39;re gonna see sealed diamonds become</text>
  <text start="600.07" dur="5.61">unsealed a lot of people will be set up</text>
  <text start="602.56" dur="6.63">for trial a lot of people will be</text>
  <text start="605.68" dur="6.36">complaining there&amp;#39;ll be candidates that</text>
  <text start="609.19" dur="4.5">will try to escape this by saying though</text>
  <text start="612.04" dur="4.95">I&amp;#39;m running for office you can&amp;#39;t attack</text>
  <text start="613.69" dur="5.85">me but it&amp;#39;s all not going to work the</text>
  <text start="616.99" dur="6.39">only way and the only thing they have</text>
  <text start="619.54" dur="7.14">left is one maybe start a war or number</text>
  <text start="623.38" dur="6.18">two bring down the financial system they</text>
  <text start="626.68" dur="6.15">know the financial system is hanging on</text>
  <text start="629.56" dur="5.91">by spit and tape they know it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="632.83" dur="5.43">illusion and that&amp;#39;s the easiest thing</text>
  <text start="635.47" dur="6.99">they can go after now it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="638.26" dur="7.37">interesting that CNN is now pushing that</text>
  <text start="642.46" dur="5.82">narrative getting the American people</text>
  <text start="645.63" dur="4.69">ready for when they try to bring down</text>
  <text start="648.28" dur="3.99">the system now does this mean they can</text>
  <text start="650.32" dur="5.82">bring down the system now the Patriots</text>
  <text start="652.27" dur="5.82">have full control but remember the deep</text>
  <text start="656.14" dur="3.33">state they continually try I mean look</text>
  <text start="658.09" dur="5.82">at this the Moller report came out and</text>
  <text start="659.47" dur="5.91">they had an event before the Muller</text>
  <text start="663.91" dur="4.35">report came out because they thought it</text>
  <text start="665.38" dur="6.33">was coming out on that day because they</text>
  <text start="668.26" dur="7.17">were fed disinformation they still try</text>
  <text start="671.71" dur="6.75">that&amp;#39;s my point they don&amp;#39;t give up so</text>
  <text start="675.43" dur="6.24">during this interview on CNN they had</text>
  <text start="678.46" dur="5.46">this individual and they were surveying</text>
  <text start="681.67" dur="5.4">individuals and they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="683.92" dur="6.51">the point that voters do believe that</text>
  <text start="687.07" dur="5.52">Trump is now hooked to the economy if</text>

  <text start="713.11" dur="4.71">tempest in a teapot for for the Beltway</text>
  <text start="715.54" dur="3.539">and people in on the coast but for a lot</text>
  <text start="717.82" dur="3.18">of folks in the Midwest they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="719.079" dur="3.51">concentrated on on the economy too</text>
  <text start="721" dur="2.94">focused on whether they have a job and</text>
  <text start="722.589" dur="3.12">whether their incomes are going up how</text>
  <text start="723.94" dur="3.18">their families are doing that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="725.709" dur="2.461">matters to them when I was in in</text>
  <text start="727.12" dur="2.79">Appleton Wisconsin</text>
  <text start="728.17" dur="3.719">but they told me was that their view of</text>
  <text start="729.91" dur="3.869">Trump rose and fell with the economy</text>
  <text start="731.889" dur="3.421">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re more supportive of him</text>
  <text start="733.779" dur="3.75">and his policies when the economy is</text>
  <text start="735.31" dur="4.29">doing well as it is now some of them are</text>
  <text start="737.529" dur="4.981">feeling it but they told me that if the</text>

  <text start="742.51" dur="3.21">feeling really is tied into the economy</text>
  <text start="744.07" dur="5.28">a lot of this other stuff is just noise</text>
  <text start="745.72" dur="6.03">I think it&amp;#39;s a good message for not only</text>
  <text start="749.35" dur="3.989">for the public it&amp;#39;s a good message for</text>
  <text start="751.75" dur="3.029">those who are seeking the presidency</text>
  <text start="753.339" dur="3.661">it&amp;#39;s also a good message for the media</text>
  <text start="754.779" dur="5.011">because I can tell you I&amp;#39;m fixated on</text>
  <text start="757" dur="5.269">all of this Muller and bar business and</text>
  <text start="759.79" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s a wake up call to hear from you</text>
  <text start="762.269" dur="3.851">that out in the country there are a lot</text>
  <text start="764.8" dur="4.11">of people who are just totally</text>
  <text start="766.12" dur="3.99">disengaged from it Richard Tao thank you</text>
  <text start="768.91" dur="3.9">for being here I appreciate your time</text>
  <text start="770.11" dur="4.14">and as you can see what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="772.81" dur="6.57">to do right now they&amp;#39;re trying to say</text>
  <text start="774.25" dur="8.22">that the economy is tied to Trump and</text>
  <text start="779.38" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;re trying to push this point making</text>
  <text start="782.47" dur="5.01">everyone understand that if the economy</text>
  <text start="785.11" dur="4.529">stays up Trump is good if the economy</text>
  <text start="787.48" dur="4.169">falls apart well that could mean the</text>
  <text start="789.639" dur="5.401">election why do you think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="791.649" dur="5.761">starting this narrative because they</text>
  <text start="795.04" dur="4.799">still believe they&amp;#39;re in control they</text>
  <text start="797.41" dur="4.44">still believe the central bank is going</text>
  <text start="799.839" dur="4.23">to bring down the economy during this</text>
  <text start="801.85" dur="3.599">period if the central bank doesn&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="804.069" dur="3.721">have a back-up plan and most likely</text>
  <text start="805.449" dur="5.76">there&amp;#39;s malware in the stock exchange</text>
  <text start="807.79" dur="7.7">malware in the banking system computer</text>
  <text start="811.209" dur="6.511">systems malware in places where the tech</text>
  <text start="815.49" dur="5.8">individuals in these companies would</text>
  <text start="817.72" dur="7.32">never detect it&amp;#39;s buried in the chipset</text>
  <text start="821.29" dur="5.52">and they don&amp;#39;t even realize that they</text>
  <text start="825.04" dur="3.96">can&amp;#39;t even see it they have no idea I</text>
  <text start="826.81" dur="4.42">mean we&amp;#39;ve been getting this information</text>
  <text start="829" dur="3.52">from cue I mean we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="831.23" dur="3.03">for a very long time this is what</text>
  <text start="832.52" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;ve done but we can see that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="834.26" dur="5.76">confirmed now and we understand that</text>
  <text start="836.78" dur="5.64">they use this technology to push their</text>
  <text start="840.02" dur="4.29">agenda so if they don&amp;#39;t have control of</text>
  <text start="842.42" dur="3.6">the central bank and they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="844.31" dur="4.17">ability to have the central bank raise</text>
  <text start="846.02" dur="4.43">rates throughout the year of 2019 going</text>
  <text start="848.48" dur="3.99">into 2020 they&amp;#39;re gonna be in trouble</text>
  <text start="850.45" dur="4.48">they&amp;#39;re gonna keep the narrative up</text>
  <text start="852.47" dur="4.98">throughout this year going into 2020</text>
  <text start="854.93" dur="4.29">saying that Trump is tied to the economy</text>
  <text start="857.45" dur="4.08">if the economy comes down he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="859.22" dur="5.18">lose the election because whatever he</text>
  <text start="861.53" dur="6.27">did did not work and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="864.4" dur="5.62">see if the central bank follows suit</text>
  <text start="867.8" dur="4.26">now once they realize that the central</text>
  <text start="870.02" dur="4.26">bank is not raising rates and as we can</text>
  <text start="872.06" dur="3.75">see right now they&amp;#39;re not why because</text>
  <text start="874.28" dur="4.41">Trump controls the magic wand</text>
  <text start="875.81" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re gonna move to plan B now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="878.69" dur="5.64">absolutely sure and positive that the</text>
  <text start="881.12" dur="5.76">Patriots understand this I mean if we</text>
  <text start="884.33" dur="4.29">understand this they understand this and</text>
  <text start="886.88" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;ll come up with something to</text>

  <text start="903.2" dur="4.26">the central bankers they&amp;#39;ll be trying to</text>
  <text start="906.26" dur="3.96">figure out a way to bring this down</text>
  <text start="907.46" dur="5.01">maybe they&amp;#39;ll try once or twice maybe</text>
  <text start="910.22" dur="4.68">even more than that who knows but</text>
  <text start="912.47" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;ll be countered every single step</text>
