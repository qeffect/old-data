  <text start="105.77" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re trying to come up with some type</text>
  <text start="107.57" dur="4.17">of bailout by August eleventh because we</text>

  <text start="111.74" dur="3.93">huge payment that they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="113.42" dur="5.43">to make we understand that the IMF is</text>
  <text start="115.67" dur="5.25">sitting out right now they might come</text>
  <text start="118.85" dur="4.62">back to the talks sometime in the fall</text>
  <text start="120.92" dur="4.68">and at this point in time I don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="123.47" dur="3.78">this bailout going forward they might</text>
  <text start="125.6" dur="3.629">get some emergency loans because they</text>
  <text start="127.25" dur="5.19">couldn&amp;#39;t reach an agreement but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="129.229" dur="7.531">see them getting a full bailout and at</text>
  <text start="132.44" dur="7.53">this point in time Greece is stuck in</text>
  <text start="136.76" dur="4.89">limbo we have austerity we have</text>
  <text start="139.97" dur="4.44">businesses failing we have businesses</text>
  <text start="141.65" dur="4.71">closing where people have no employment</text>
  <text start="144.41" dur="4.89">people do not have homes people have a</text>
  <text start="146.36" dur="4.56">hard time finding food the banks are</text>
  <text start="149.3" dur="2.64">collapsing most of the people have taken</text>
  <text start="150.92" dur="2.94">their money out of the bank&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="151.94" dur="3.72">they knew what happened in Cyprus they</text>
  <text start="153.86" dur="4.29">were prepared because they knew they</text>
  <text start="155.66" dur="4.499">didn&amp;#39;t want their money in the banks</text>
  <text start="158.15" dur="3.599">because they knew capital controls were</text>
  <text start="160.159" dur="3.39">going to be in effect for a very long</text>
  <text start="161.749" dur="2.671">time and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="163.549" dur="3.061">now</text>
  <text start="164.42" dur="3.69">and for all those people who don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="166.61" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s going to happen here or in Europe</text>
  <text start="168.11" dur="6.72">and Canada guess what it is going to</text>
  <text start="171.83" dur="4.89">happen so they&amp;#39;re looking to come to</text>
  <text start="174.83" dur="4.56">some type of an agreement by August</text>
  <text start="176.72" dur="4.89">eleventh will this happen I&amp;#39;m not too</text>
  <text start="179.39" dur="3.929">positive on this right now because the</text>
  <text start="181.61" dur="3.93">IMF is completely out of the talks</text>
  <text start="183.319" dur="4.441">they&amp;#39;re saying yeah with Greece with</text>
  <text start="185.54" dur="5.07">this type of debt it cannot be sustained</text>
  <text start="187.76" dur="4.8">it will collapse in in the next couple</text>
  <text start="190.61" dur="5.129">of months if we continue on like this</text>
  <text start="192.56" dur="6.72">and this whole thing really could have</text>
  <text start="195.739" dur="7.351">been completely avoided if Greece stuck</text>
  <text start="199.28" dur="6.6">to what it was doing if it followed the</text>
  <text start="203.09" dur="5.22">people and they followed up on the</text>
  <text start="205.88" dur="4.74">odious debt and the war reparations that</text>
  <text start="208.31" dur="6.14">Germany owed they could have written off</text>
  <text start="210.62" dur="8.97">all of this debt and started fresh and</text>
  <text start="214.45" dur="7.599">create their economy create jobs spur</text>
  <text start="219.59" dur="5.94">economic growth almost like Iceland</text>
  <text start="222.049" dur="6.651">because this is what they did they took</text>
  <text start="225.53" dur="5.82">control they got away from the bankers</text>
  <text start="228.7" dur="5.62">this is what we need this is what we</text>
  <text start="231.35" dur="5.009">need to happen right now I mean the</text>
  <text start="234.32" dur="3.72">eurozone is basically falling apart I</text>
  <text start="236.359" dur="3.901">mean SP was out there and they</text>
  <text start="238.04" dur="6.77">downgraded them we understand that</text>
  <text start="240.26" dur="7.68">factory orders are down we see the</text>
  <text start="244.81" dur="6.22">eurozone sentiment it has dipped in</text>
  <text start="247.94" dur="5.22">August centex research group index</text>
  <text start="251.03" dur="7.199">tracking morale among investors and</text>
  <text start="253.16" dur="7.139">analysts dip from two 18.4 from 18.5 in</text>
  <text start="258.229" dur="5.491">July now they were expecting this to go</text>
  <text start="260.299" dur="7.311">up to 20 point two so this is a huge</text>
  <text start="263.72" dur="6.48">decline and they missed expectations</text>
  <text start="267.61" dur="6.54">because people are waking up and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="270.2" dur="10.95">starting to realize something is wrong I</text>
  <text start="274.15" dur="9.25">mean the OECD countries they have 35</text>
  <text start="281.15" dur="6.21">million people between the ages of 16</text>
  <text start="283.4" dur="6.87">and 29 that are jobless overall young</text>
  <text start="287.36" dur="5.22">people are twice as likely as prime age</text>
  <text start="290.27" dur="3.87">workers to be unemployed right now this</text>
  <text start="292.58" dur="4.53">is why we&amp;#39;re seeing unemployment rates</text>
  <text start="294.14" dur="4.17">in these countries between forty and</text>
  <text start="297.11" dur="5.22">fifty percent</text>
  <text start="298.31" dur="6.96">how in the world can the economies</text>
  <text start="302.33" dur="5.55">improve if we&amp;#39;re having half of the</text>
  <text start="305.27" dur="4.74">youth unemployed because this is the</text>
  <text start="307.88" dur="6.96">next generation the next generation</text>
  <text start="310.01" dur="7.35">needs to earn the money to contribute to</text>
  <text start="314.84" dur="5.88">paying off the debt of these countries</text>
  <text start="317.36" dur="4.44">with their revenue with the money</text>
  <text start="320.72" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re saving they go out and they</text>
  <text start="321.8" dur="5.01">purchase homes they buy cars and they</text>
  <text start="324.17" dur="4.65">pie goods if they&amp;#39;re unemployed and</text>
  <text start="326.81" dur="4.14">believe me the other fifty percent they</text>
  <text start="328.82" dur="4.74">don&amp;#39;t have great jobs most of them have</text>
  <text start="330.95" dur="5.25">part-time jobs they&amp;#39;re not bringing in</text>
  <text start="333.56" dur="5.82">the funds so we definitely have a</text>
  <text start="336.2" dur="5.85">problem but here in America it&amp;#39;s not any</text>
  <text start="339.38" dur="4.86">better and of course the numbers are a</text>
  <text start="342.05" dur="5.37">little bit more skewed I mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="344.24" dur="6.21">using the u6 unemployment rate for 18 to</text>
  <text start="347.42" dur="5.94">29 year olds and this is looking at</text>
  <text start="350.45" dur="4.32">about 13.8 percent now of course there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="353.36" dur="4.17">a lot of adjustments here the labor</text>
  <text start="354.77" dur="5.7">force participation do not include those</text>
  <text start="357.53" dur="5.25">people that have fallen off you know the</text>
  <text start="360.47" dur="5.07">young people who graduated college who</text>
  <text start="362.78" dur="4.92">have student loans they don&amp;#39;t want jobs</text>
  <text start="365.54" dur="5.31">well of course they do this is</text>
  <text start="367.7" dur="4.59">absolutely ridiculous and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="370.85" dur="4.68">count those people who haven&amp;#39;t been on</text>
  <text start="372.29" dur="5.04">an interview for four weeks there they</text>
  <text start="375.53" dur="5.82">might be continually looking for jobs</text>
  <text start="377.33" dur="7.08">but they&amp;#39;re just not counted and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="381.35" dur="5.55">happening right now is that these jobs</text>
  <text start="384.41" dur="5.37">are completely drying up there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="386.9" dur="4.92">out there eighty percent of college</text>
  <text start="389.78" dur="5.43">graduates who are kind of coming out of</text>
  <text start="391.82" dur="7.05">college right now they cannot find work</text>
  <text start="395.21" dur="5.31">in their majors so they have to go look</text>
  <text start="398.87" dur="3.39">for part-time work they&amp;#39;re living with</text>
  <text start="400.52" dur="6.89">their parents and their loans are</text>
  <text start="402.26" dur="7.38">modified so this is a huge problem</text>
  <text start="407.41" dur="5.38">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this and I</text>
  <text start="409.64" dur="5.55">talk a lot about real estate is that</text>
  <text start="412.79" dur="5.64">this economy when we look at the retail</text>
  <text start="415.19" dur="5.28">sector we look at unemployment we look</text>
  <text start="418.43" dur="5.64">at the college graduates we look at all</text>
  <text start="420.47" dur="5.37">the bubbles and we understand from all</text>
  <text start="424.07" dur="3.63">of this that this economy is completely</text>
  <text start="425.84" dur="3.36">falling apart and collapsing we hear a</text>
  <text start="427.7" dur="4.5">lot from a fine a lot of different</text>
  <text start="429.2" dur="5.34">financial experts and they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="432.2" dur="6.42">you know ringing the alarm bell saying</text>
  <text start="434.54" dur="7.5">yes this system is crashing and if real</text>
  <text start="438.62" dur="7.17">estate is doing so well why are we</text>
  <text start="442.04" dur="7.07">seeing companies laying off in the</text>
  <text start="445.79" dur="7.23">mortgage department why is housing com</text>
  <text start="449.11" dur="8.17">laying off six hundred people if the</text>
  <text start="453.02" dur="6.72">real estate industry is so strong I mean</text>
  <text start="457.28" dur="6.45">if the automobile industry is so strong</text>
  <text start="459.74" dur="6.66">why is advanced auto parts laying off 50</text>
  <text start="463.73" dur="5.58">people in their corporate offices they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="466.4" dur="5.79">be adding jobs they be expanding because</text>
  <text start="469.31" dur="6.9">business is so great but this is not</text>
  <text start="472.19" dur="7.14">what we&amp;#39;re seeing let&amp;#39;s put all this</text>
  <text start="476.21" dur="8.49">into perspective here and let&amp;#39;s go back</text>
  <text start="479.33" dur="9.33">in time and when we look back in time we</text>
  <text start="484.7" dur="6.87">see people employed we see retail</text>
  <text start="488.66" dur="6.54">expanding we see strip malls opening up</text>
  <text start="491.57" dur="7.74">moles building out adding more stores</text>
  <text start="495.2" dur="7.8">people hiring what we&amp;#39;re seeing now is</text>
  <text start="499.31" dur="7.23">more and more stores closing laying off</text>
  <text start="503" dur="5.04">people we see the housing market where</text>
  <text start="506.54" dur="6.56">the mortgage departments are laying off</text>
  <text start="508.04" dur="8.28">people and the banks are instructed to</text>
  <text start="513.1" dur="7.45">keep the foreclosures off the market so</text>
  <text start="516.32" dur="7.74">the prices can go up and when we look at</text>
  <text start="520.55" dur="5.73">unemployment we see very interesting</text>
  <text start="524.06" dur="4.8">things I mean if we look over the</text>
  <text start="526.28" dur="6">previous year from July 2014 through</text>
  <text start="528.86" dur="7.26">July 2015 those in the age group of 55</text>
  <text start="532.28" dur="10.05">and older gained 1.5 million jobs youth</text>
  <text start="536.12" dur="11.13">16 to 18 and 22 24 lost 887 thousand</text>
  <text start="542.33" dur="9.93">jobs and 489 thousand jobs today there</text>
  <text start="547.25" dur="12.15">are 4 million fewer jobs in this age</text>
  <text start="552.26" dur="9.78">group 25 to 54 then in December of 2007</text>
  <text start="559.4" dur="5.34">so in december two thousand seven when</text>
  <text start="562.04" dur="3.69">we were hitting the peak and we had 4</text>
  <text start="564.74" dur="3.48">million jobs</text>
  <text start="565.73" dur="7.979">you&amp;#39;re trying to tell me we&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="568.22" dur="11.1">incredible recovery with 4 million fewer</text>
  <text start="573.709" dur="9.541">jobs between the main age bracket of</text>
  <text start="579.32" dur="6.09">work something&amp;#39;s wrong from two thousand</text>
  <text start="583.25" dur="4.44">nine to twenty thirteen Americans in</text>
  <text start="585.41" dur="6.15">this age group were down six million</text>
  <text start="587.69" dur="5.82">jobs those years alleged economic</text>
  <text start="591.56" dur="6">recovery apparently bypassed Americans</text>
  <text start="593.51" dur="6.66">of prime working age as of July 2015 the</text>
  <text start="597.56" dur="3.99">US has 27 million two hundred and</text>
  <text start="600.17" dur="5.609">sixty-five thousand people with</text>
  <text start="601.55" dur="5.88">part-time jobs of whom 6.3 million or</text>
  <text start="605.779" dur="3.721">twenty three percent are working</text>
  <text start="607.43" dur="5.37">part-time because they cannot find</text>
  <text start="609.5" dur="6.18">full-time jobs there are seven point one</text>
  <text start="612.8" dur="5.46">to four million Americans who hold</text>
  <text start="615.68" dur="5.909">multiple part-time jobs in order to make</text>
  <text start="618.26" dur="4.769">ends meet this is an increase of three</text>
  <text start="621.589" dur="6.06">hundred and thirty-seven thousand jobs</text>
  <text start="623.029" dur="11.071">from a year ago so what are we seeing</text>
  <text start="627.649" dur="9.541">here people cannot make it with this</text>
  <text start="634.1" dur="6.929">type of work people have no work people</text>
  <text start="637.19" dur="6.42">have part-time work and this is why we</text>
  <text start="641.029" dur="6.151">are having this problem that jobs are</text>
  <text start="643.61" dur="6.69">drying up and what are we seeing we are</text>
  <text start="647.18" dur="6.54">seeing more and more part-time work</text>
  <text start="650.3" dur="7.43">waiters waitresses if there is any</text>
  <text start="653.72" dur="7.619">retail jobs but those full-time</text>
  <text start="657.73" dur="6.7">high-paying jobs they are disappearing I</text>
  <text start="661.339" dur="6.81">mean we have been seeing layoffs from</text>
  <text start="664.43" dur="6.33">the start of 2014 going into this year</text>
  <text start="668.149" dur="7.141">in the hundreds of thousands I mean</text>
  <text start="670.76" dur="9.079">companies are laying off people by the</text>
  <text start="675.29" dur="9.96">tens of thousands we have a problem and</text>
  <text start="679.839" dur="11.5">this system cannot work and it won&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="685.25" dur="10.819">will collapse and Russia China right now</text>
  <text start="691.339" dur="8.071">they have their economies being pushed</text>
  <text start="696.069" dur="7.121">because of these low oil prices</text>
  <text start="699.41" dur="6.65">and this is being done on purpose and we</text>
  <text start="703.19" dur="5.73">see and they know they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="706.06" dur="5.709">purchasing goal because they realize the</text>
  <text start="708.92" dur="4.95">country with the gold that&amp;#39;s the country</text>
  <text start="711.769" dur="4.61">that wins the country that just holds</text>
  <text start="713.87" dur="7.05">paper that&amp;#39;s the country that loses and</text>
  <text start="716.379" dur="8.89">they realize this and right now Russia</text>
  <text start="720.92" dur="8.58">is ready to issue 30 million national</text>
  <text start="725.269" dur="6.36">payment cards in 2016 because what they</text>
  <text start="729.5" dur="5.029">did is they design their system to be</text>
  <text start="731.629" dur="8.19">separate and apart from the Western</text>
  <text start="734.529" dur="6.341">banking system they&amp;#39;re detaching because</text>
  <text start="739.819" dur="4.531">they know when this thing comes</text>
  <text start="740.87" dur="5.579">crumbling down they can&amp;#39;t be a part of</text>
  <text start="744.35" dur="5.37">it they have to be completely</text>
  <text start="746.449" dur="5.13">independent and their system has to work</text>

  <text start="755.029" dur="5.401">bricks the aiai the aiib this is why</text>
  <text start="758.81" dur="4.23">companies are making bilateral trade</text>

  <text start="763.04" dur="6.06">clearing houses for the u1 and remember</text>
  <text start="765.31" dur="5.589">all around the world I mean except for</text>
  <text start="769.1" dur="6.63">the United States of course because the</text>
  <text start="770.899" dur="8.851">United States realizes that if this</text>
  <text start="775.73" dur="7.859">system collapses their alternative is to</text>
  <text start="779.75" dur="7.62">start war this is what they&amp;#39;re planning</text>
  <text start="783.589" dur="7.891">on because they do not want to be blamed</text>
  <text start="787.37" dur="7.519">for what is coming and we can see that</text>
  <text start="791.48" dur="7.049">this is accelerating the time is coming</text>
  <text start="794.889" dur="7.091">where we all have to realize that yes</text>
  <text start="798.529" dur="7.261">this economy will not make it much</text>
  <text start="801.98" dur="7.26">longer yes they can prop it up yes they</text>
  <text start="805.79" dur="7.229">can manipulate the numbers yes they can</text>
  <text start="809.24" dur="6.149">start some type of an event but</text>
  <text start="813.019" dur="3.961">eventually something&amp;#39;s going to break</text>
  <text start="815.389" dur="4.2">now they can bring down the system on</text>
  <text start="816.98" dur="4.829">their own which they would like to do</text>
  <text start="819.589" dur="5.881">and this is why I believe they are</text>
  <text start="821.809" dur="6.301">trying to manipulate the system so they</text>
  <text start="825.47" dur="5.28">can raise the interest rates a little</text>
  <text start="828.11" dur="4.89">bit at a time and they know once they do</text>
  <text start="830.75" dur="4.4">this the economy is going to fall apart</text>
  <text start="833" dur="5.22">but they&amp;#39;re going to do it in different</text>
  <text start="835.15" dur="6.97">segments and once they reach a certain</text>
  <text start="838.22" dur="7.53">point they can say we were in a recovery</text>
  <text start="842.12" dur="6.81">the rate hike is working and then all of</text>
  <text start="845.75" dur="5.97">a sudden we&amp;#39;re getting ready to do</text>
  <text start="848.93" dur="5.16">another rate hike and we were hit with</text>
  <text start="851.72" dur="4.92">some type of physical attack or some</text>
  <text start="854.09" dur="5.13">type of cyber attack and they can blame</text>
  <text start="856.64" dur="5.16">this on another country or group and say</text>
  <text start="859.22" dur="4.5">we were in a recovery it was working out</text>
  <text start="861.8" dur="4.35">perfectly unemployment numbers one from</text>
  <text start="863.72" dur="5.16">five point three percent or whatever</text>
  <text start="866.15" dur="5.49">down to four point nine percent rates</text>
  <text start="868.88" dur="6.57">were in rates were going up everything</text>
  <text start="871.64" dur="5.97">seemed perfect and it seems this is the</text>
  <text start="875.45" dur="5.34">process that they&amp;#39;re bringing us through</text>
  <text start="877.61" dur="4.89">now something else can occur where</text>
  <text start="880.79" dur="3.39">everything starts to fall apart on its</text>
  <text start="882.5" dur="3.6">own and this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="884.18" dur="4.53">control and sometimes they can and</text>
  <text start="886.1" dur="5.07">sometimes they can&amp;#39;t but we all need to</text>
