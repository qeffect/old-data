  <text start="53.54" dur="6.86">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="57.56" dur="6.26">report my name is Dave in this episode</text>
  <text start="60.4" dur="5.71">1387 bien today&amp;#39;s date is September 26</text>
  <text start="63.82" dur="4.57">2017 and the thought of the episode is</text>
  <text start="66.11" dur="5.16">the clock is ticking down is the Cabal</text>
  <text start="68.39" dur="5.04">ready to make their next move let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="71.27" dur="5.01">into the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="73.43" dur="4.71">geopolitical news now less than a week</text>
  <text start="76.28" dur="4.8">ago we talked about how Facebook was</text>
  <text start="78.14" dur="6.12">handing over all these ads that you know</text>
  <text start="81.08" dur="6.24">they said Russia took out to push the</text>
  <text start="84.26" dur="4.35">election for Trump and they were handing</text>
  <text start="87.32" dur="4.83">this over to the congressional</text>
  <text start="88.61" dur="8.369">investigators and also to Muller and it</text>
  <text start="92.15" dur="6.93">turns out that a lot of these ads well</text>
  <text start="96.979" dur="4.771">they weren&amp;#39;t really for Trump</text>
  <text start="99.08" dur="6.27">they showed support for Clinton and</text>
  <text start="101.75" dur="7.11">again they have no evidence that these</text>
  <text start="105.35" dur="6.15">ads were taken out by Russia and there</text>
  <text start="108.86" dur="3.96">was you know about 3000 different ads</text>
  <text start="111.5" dur="3.72">and they&amp;#39;re going through them and</text>
  <text start="112.82" dur="5.909">they&amp;#39;re starting to realize it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="115.22" dur="6.21">what they think it is and it looks like</text>
  <text start="118.729" dur="5.701">a lot of them have to do with Clinton</text>
  <text start="121.43" dur="7.049">and not Trump and again they are just</text>
  <text start="124.43" dur="6.66">trying to find anything out of any of</text>
  <text start="128.479" dur="4.561">this just to blame Trump for Russian</text>
  <text start="131.09" dur="4.86">collusion because at this point they</text>
  <text start="133.04" dur="4.77">have no evidence they have nothing they</text>
  <text start="135.95" dur="4.53">can&amp;#39;t prove anything and if they did</text>
  <text start="137.81" dur="4.92">have proof guess what it would have been</text>
  <text start="140.48" dur="4.5">all over the place and we know from</text>
  <text start="142.73" dur="4.44">Project Veritas when they went</text>
  <text start="144.98" dur="5.31">undercover inside of CNN in other places</text>
  <text start="147.17" dur="5.129">we know that this is a nothing burger</text>
  <text start="150.29" dur="4.74">this was all made up by the corporate</text>
  <text start="152.299" dur="5.851">media by the Cabal to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="155.03" dur="5.7">that Russia is the enemy that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="158.15" dur="5.61">pushing their agenda they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="160.73" dur="6.09">push their candidate into being elected</text>
  <text start="163.76" dur="6.479">and every all of this is complete lies</text>
  <text start="166.82" dur="7.53">that&amp;#39;s all this is now we see out in</text>
  <text start="170.239" dur="5.821">North Korea the Cabal is still provoking</text>
  <text start="174.35" dur="4.29">North Korea North Korea they have</text>
  <text start="176.06" dur="4.2">boosted their East Coast defences moving</text>
  <text start="178.64" dur="4.08">aircraft and for fighting their</text>
  <text start="180.26" dur="4.68">positions making sure that United States</text>
  <text start="182.72" dur="3.6">does not invade and at this point in</text>
  <text start="184.94" dur="2.34">time I don&amp;#39;t think the United States is</text>
  <text start="186.32" dur="3.69">going to invade what</text>
  <text start="187.28" dur="5.22">so ever White House spokesman Sarah</text>
  <text start="190.01" dur="4.08">Sanders denied on Monday that the United</text>
  <text start="192.5" dur="4.319">States has declared war calling the</text>
  <text start="194.09" dur="4.92">suggestion absurd and China&amp;#39;s foreign</text>
  <text start="196.819" dur="4.351">ministry spokesman Lu Kang said war on</text>
  <text start="199.01" dur="4.71">the Korean Peninsula would have no</text>
  <text start="201.17" dur="3.78">winner and I know general mattis&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="203.72" dur="3.03">the corporate media is out there saying</text>
  <text start="204.95" dur="3.869">that he has three different plans</text>
  <text start="206.75" dur="4.65">none of these plans are going to work</text>
  <text start="208.819" dur="4.321">the United States at this point is not</text>
  <text start="211.4" dur="5.55">going to invade North Korea unless</text>
  <text start="213.14" dur="7.26">unless unless there is some type of</text>
  <text start="216.95" dur="5.64">false flag which the Cabal might do</text>
  <text start="220.4" dur="5.43">where they make it where they might make</text>
  <text start="222.59" dur="5.49">it look like North Korea fired some type</text>
  <text start="225.83" dur="4.29">of missile maybe from a submarine or</text>
  <text start="228.08" dur="4.409">they could say that it came from this</text>
  <text start="230.12" dur="4.86">area but the problem is is that China</text>
  <text start="232.489" dur="4.021">and Russia right now they have their</text>
  <text start="234.98" dur="4.14">satellites they&amp;#39;ve been monitoring the</text>
  <text start="236.51" dur="5.1">situation in this area to make sure that</text>
  <text start="239.12" dur="4.89">they can&amp;#39;t pull off a false flag now</text>
  <text start="241.61" dur="4.94">doesn&amp;#39;t mean they won&amp;#39;t try they most</text>
  <text start="244.01" dur="5.25">likely will now the Chinese military</text>
  <text start="246.55" dur="5.499">they have for the first time staged</text>
  <text start="249.26" dur="5.25">live-fire drills at the country&amp;#39;s first</text>
  <text start="252.049" dur="5.22">overseas based which was open in the</text>
  <text start="254.51" dur="5.819">Horn of Africa this is Djibouti and this</text>
  <text start="257.269" dur="4.321">is in the Strait of Hormuz this is the</text>
  <text start="260.329" dur="3.631">place where the United States used to</text>
  <text start="261.59" dur="5.13">have a base now China has a base and it</text>
  <text start="263.96" dur="5.79">looks like China is making deals with a</text>
  <text start="266.72" dur="4.68">lot of the African nations and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="269.75" dur="3.06">teaching them how to build their</text>
  <text start="271.4" dur="3.63">building schools they&amp;#39;re building</text>
  <text start="272.81" dur="4.14">railways they&amp;#39;re working with them</text>
  <text start="275.03" dur="3.6">economically compared to United States</text>
  <text start="276.95" dur="4.71">which was working with these countries</text>
  <text start="278.63" dur="5.55">by force saying you will do what we say</text>
  <text start="281.66" dur="6.03">or we will bring in forces and we will</text>
  <text start="284.18" dur="4.859">have regime change now we see the US and</text>
  <text start="287.69" dur="4.349">it looks like this is coming from the</text>
  <text start="289.039" dur="5.25">Cabal they might be preparing</text>
  <text start="292.039" dur="6.391">restrictions for Russian military</text>
  <text start="294.289" dur="7.861">flights over America now we know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="298.43" dur="6.299">the 2002 Open Skies treaty which they</text>
  <text start="302.15" dur="4.71">signed and that means that the United</text>
  <text start="304.729" dur="4.411">States can fly over Russia Russia can</text>
  <text start="306.86" dur="4.77">fly over the United States they can take</text>
  <text start="309.14" dur="4.86">pictures and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="311.63" dur="5.4">the United States the Cabal might be</text>
  <text start="314" dur="5.729">trying to push the agenda to violate the</text>
  <text start="317.03" dur="4.08">treaty now again this is coming out of</text>
  <text start="319.729" dur="2.881">the Wall Street Journal this</text>
  <text start="321.11" dur="3.6">be completely fake phony and false which</text>
  <text start="322.61" dur="3.87">most likely it is to make everyone</text>
  <text start="324.71" dur="3.42">believe that oh look what we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="326.48" dur="3.51">we&amp;#39;re canceling with Russia because they</text>
  <text start="328.13" dur="3.24">were trying to spy on something and it</text>
  <text start="329.99" dur="3.87">looks like they&amp;#39;re trying to build this</text>
  <text start="331.37" dur="4.98">up right now Russia is not reporting any</text>
  <text start="333.86" dur="6.21">of this at this point so we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="336.35" dur="6.45">wait and see how this story and how this</text>
  <text start="340.07" dur="6.12">reporting actually goes we see out in</text>
  <text start="342.8" dur="6.87">Iraq and Syria the Kurdish separates</text>
  <text start="346.19" dur="7.32">they are saying that yes we have voted</text>
  <text start="349.67" dur="6.6">and we want our independence now the</text>
  <text start="353.51" dur="4.71">Iraqi government and the Syrian</text>
  <text start="356.27" dur="4.11">government well they&amp;#39;re really not going</text>
  <text start="358.22" dur="3.96">along with this right now and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="360.38" dur="3.9">very interesting about all of this is</text>
  <text start="362.18" dur="4.2">I&amp;#39;m wondering because I haven&amp;#39;t seen any</text>
  <text start="364.28" dur="4.62">reports from the UN or any other</text>
  <text start="366.38" dur="4.29">independent monitoring of the referendum</text>
  <text start="368.9" dur="4.23">we just know that the Kurds had a</text>
  <text start="370.67" dur="5.19">referendum and we&amp;#39;re not getting</text>
  <text start="373.13" dur="5.1">anything from any monitors of the</text>
  <text start="375.86" dur="5.03">referendum which normally takes place to</text>
  <text start="378.23" dur="4.98">show that this was a true referendum and</text>
  <text start="380.89" dur="4.3">we see right now that they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="383.21" dur="4.59">telling us that there was an</text>
  <text start="385.19" dur="5.61">overwhelming turnout and that they all</text>
  <text start="387.8" dur="5.67">voted for independence and this is going</text>
  <text start="390.8" dur="5.49">to happen which they want to happen in</text>
  <text start="393.47" dur="5.94">Iraq and Syria and I think even parts of</text>
  <text start="396.29" dur="5.58">a Ram so we could see there the the</text>
  <text start="399.41" dur="6.39">Cabal is going to use this to create</text>
  <text start="401.87" dur="6.99">chaos in the region and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="405.8" dur="6.24">push the chaos probably at this point</text>
  <text start="408.86" dur="6.42">because as the Iraqi government as the</text>
  <text start="412.04" dur="6.12">Syrian government reject this this is</text>
  <text start="415.28" dur="5.48">when the United States the Cabal this is</text>
  <text start="418.16" dur="8.67">when they&amp;#39;re gonna push their agenda and</text>
  <text start="420.76" dur="7.63">try to push the separation of these</text>
  <text start="426.83" dur="2.97">countries but this is why they built the</text>
  <text start="428.39" dur="3.51">basis this is why they brought in the</text>
  <text start="429.8" dur="3.39">weapons this is why they prepared all</text>
  <text start="431.9" dur="3.15">this and we&amp;#39;ve been following this and</text>
  <text start="433.19" dur="4.83">tracking this this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="435.05" dur="6.33">doing it because they knew that this</text>
  <text start="438.02" dur="4.77">wasn&amp;#39;t gonna go over so easily where</text>
  <text start="441.38" dur="3.69">they just vote and they say okay you</text>
  <text start="442.79" dur="4.86">know what this is your land they knew</text>
  <text start="445.07" dur="5.7">that they were going to have to fight</text>
  <text start="447.65" dur="6.84">and fight the governments of these</text>
  <text start="450.77" dur="4.44">countries and in Syria and interact they</text>
  <text start="454.49" dur="2.88">know that there</text>
  <text start="455.21" dur="3.78">mercenary forces they are beaten so they</text>
  <text start="457.37" dur="5.13">don&amp;#39;t care about that they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="458.99" dur="6.69">using the Kurds to push the agenda right</text>
  <text start="462.5" dur="5.25">now now we see that the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="465.68" dur="5.22">fighters they are coming out and they</text>
  <text start="467.75" dur="6.3">are admitting that they were forbidden</text>
  <text start="470.9" dur="6.389">to attack the Kurdish forces in Deir</text>
  <text start="474.05" dur="6.209">Ezzor they were forbidden to fight the</text>
  <text start="477.289" dur="6">us-backed route the US troops that were</text>
  <text start="480.259" dur="6.301">in Syria and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="483.289" dur="4.741">is that the reason why they were</text>
  <text start="486.56" dur="4.919">forbidden is because they were</text>
  <text start="488.03" dur="5.93">controlled supported by the United</text>
  <text start="491.479" dur="5.521">States Israel and the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="493.96" dur="6.1">now Russia has done something very</text>
  <text start="497" dur="5.43">interesting they have built a bridge</text>
  <text start="500.06" dur="4.97">across the Euphrates the bridge is about</text>
  <text start="502.43" dur="4.829">210 meters long it can serve around</text>
  <text start="505.03" dur="4.389">8,000 cars a day the bridge supports</text>
  <text start="507.259" dur="4.711">heavy armored vehicles such as tanks</text>
  <text start="509.419" dur="4.651">infantry fighting vehicles multiple</text>
  <text start="511.97" dur="6.3">launch rocket systems and the bridge</text>
  <text start="514.07" dur="6.69">will also be used for 8.8 convoys to</text>
  <text start="518.27" dur="4.649">liberated communities and the building</text>
  <text start="520.76" dur="5.88">of the bridge will enable the Syrian</text>
  <text start="522.919" dur="5.971">army to throw its armored columns at the</text>
  <text start="526.64" dur="5.639">east part of the Euphrates and move</text>
  <text start="528.89" dur="6.59">further east now this is a game-changer</text>
  <text start="532.279" dur="5.881">because a lot of heavy military</text>
  <text start="535.48" dur="5.2">artillery is going to be moving towards</text>
  <text start="538.16" dur="4.919">the east which will then push the paid</text>
  <text start="540.68" dur="4.71">mercenaries further and further east and</text>
  <text start="543.079" dur="4.411">they have no place to go and this is</text>
  <text start="545.39" dur="4.35">going to bump up against the Kurdish</text>
  <text start="547.49" dur="5.039">territory so we&amp;#39;re gonna have to watch</text>
  <text start="549.74" dur="8.24">this situation very very closely to see</text>
  <text start="552.529" dur="8.641">what does occur now very interestingly</text>
  <text start="557.98" dur="6.7">three high-ranking Russian officers were</text>
  <text start="561.17" dur="6.09">killed in an Isis attack in eastern</text>
  <text start="564.68" dur="5.25">Syria and it looks like they might have</text>
  <text start="567.26" dur="5.04">been killed by the US Special Forces or</text>
  <text start="569.93" dur="6.57">insurgents under US Special Forces</text>
  <text start="572.3" dur="5.64">control and Russia is looking at this</text>
  <text start="576.5" dur="4.23">situation and they came out with a</text>
  <text start="577.94" dur="6.269">statement let listen if the US attacks</text>
  <text start="580.73" dur="6.27">Russia we will respond and it looks like</text>
  <text start="584.209" dur="4.951">the Cabal was trying to push their</text>
  <text start="587" dur="5.509">agenda by May</text>
  <text start="589.16" dur="6.869">be getting Russia involved in a war and</text>
  <text start="592.509" dur="5.26">we can see right now this is exactly</text>
  <text start="596.029" dur="4.021">what they want because we need to think</text>
  <text start="597.769" dur="3.541">about something and it&amp;#39;s very clear when</text>
  <text start="600.05" dur="3.75">we look at all of this in the big</text>
  <text start="601.31" dur="6.149">picture is that they are running out of</text>
  <text start="603.8" dur="4.829">time the clock is ticking down and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="607.459" dur="3.06">only a matter of time</text>
  <text start="608.629" dur="3.861">I mean Lavrov is already out there</text>
  <text start="610.519" dur="4.38">calling for the United States to leave</text>
  <text start="612.49" dur="4.719">Syria right now along with the coalition</text>
  <text start="614.899" dur="3.781">forces they&amp;#39;re destroying the basis of</text>
  <text start="617.209" dur="4.281">the Islamic state al Qaeda because</text>
  <text start="618.68" dur="5.759">they&amp;#39;re there in a big mop up operation</text>
  <text start="621.49" dur="5.26">North Korea they&amp;#39;re not getting what</text>
  <text start="624.439" dur="4.38">they really wanted at this point they</text>
  <text start="626.75" dur="3.75">wanted a war and they&amp;#39;re still trying to</text>
  <text start="628.819" dur="3.27">push this but it&amp;#39;s not going the way</text>
  <text start="630.5" dur="3.75">they want it looks like they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="632.089" dur="6.781">have to try some type of false flag and</text>
  <text start="634.25" dur="7.62">in Syria and in Iraq they just had their</text>
  <text start="638.87" dur="5.1">referendum and they&amp;#39;re preparing to have</text>
  <text start="641.87" dur="3.81">chaos so we have a lot of things</text>
  <text start="643.97" dur="3.809">happening all at once because they</text>
  <text start="645.68" dur="4.589">understand and they know that they only</text>
  <text start="647.779" dur="5.91">have a certain period of time to push</text>
  <text start="650.269" dur="7.31">this agenda and what we&amp;#39;re seeing from</text>
  <text start="653.689" dur="7.411">all of this is that they can&amp;#39;t wait</text>
  <text start="657.579" dur="4.961">because everything that we&amp;#39;ve looked at</text>
  <text start="661.1" dur="4.38">and everything that we&amp;#39;ve tracked over</text>
  <text start="662.54" dur="5.489">time is deteriorating and falling apart</text>
  <text start="665.48" dur="5.789">very very quickly so this means the</text>
  <text start="668.029" dur="6.511">Cabal since they have no evidence of</text>
  <text start="671.269" dur="6.451">Russian collusion they tried to push a</text>
  <text start="674.54" dur="5.52">civil war in Charlottesville they tried</text>
