  <text start="47.22" dur="4.619">gigantic blast now before I get started</text>
  <text start="50.19" dur="4.02">I just want to make an announcement I</text>
  <text start="51.839" dur="4.5">just placed a new interview on The X 22</text>
  <text start="54.21" dur="4.23">report spotlight YouTube channel it is V</text>
  <text start="56.339" dur="3.36">the guerrilla economists so you can go</text>

  <text start="66.39" dur="3.9">to news sentinel com same thing scroll</text>
  <text start="69.21" dur="2.4">down a little bit look over to your</text>
  <text start="70.29" dur="4.02">right hand side you&amp;#39;ll see the video</text>
  <text start="71.61" dur="5.16">there let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="74.31" dur="4.949">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="76.77" dur="6.33">now there was a bill in the House of</text>
  <text start="79.259" dur="8.161">Representatives that would allow law</text>
  <text start="83.1" dur="8.58">enforcement to use the cell phone</text>
  <text start="87.42" dur="6.089">carriers to track every single person in</text>
  <text start="91.68" dur="6.06">an event of an emergency without a</text>
  <text start="93.509" dur="6.541">warrant now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="97.74" dur="5.22">about this is that the US House of</text>
  <text start="100.05" dur="6.15">Representatives they thought that this</text>
  <text start="102.96" dur="5.46">was going to pass they thought it was</text>
  <text start="106.2" dur="4.8">going to pass and they said okay let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="108.42" dur="6.12">put this up and it was the kelsey smith</text>
  <text start="111" dur="8.37">act but it didn&amp;#39;t pass lawmakers voted</text>
  <text start="114.54" dur="6.78">229 to 158 and it&amp;#39;s falling short of the</text>
  <text start="119.37" dur="5.22">two-thirds threshold necessary for this</text>
  <text start="121.32" dur="5.52">to pass now the rejection was considered</text>
  <text start="124.59" dur="4.229">surprising because the house leadership</text>
  <text start="126.84" dur="5.64">really schedules a vote on legislation</text>
  <text start="128.819" dur="7.681">if it is not confident that it will pass</text>
  <text start="132.48" dur="7.5">with no problem now civil liberties</text>
  <text start="136.5" dur="7.83">groups they oppose the bill arguing that</text>
  <text start="139.98" dur="6.21">it was well intended but it created a</text>
  <text start="144.33" dur="3.42">warrant loophole and could lead to</text>
  <text start="146.19" dur="3.84">expanded government surveillance which</text>
  <text start="147.75" dur="5.939">definitely that would that would happen</text>
  <text start="150.03" dur="5.31">now if they have a case and there was</text>
  <text start="153.689" dur="4.891">some type of emergency they can go to a</text>
  <text start="155.34" dur="6.3">judge get a warrant and they can use the</text>
  <text start="158.58" dur="5.8">information to track the person they</text>
  <text start="161.64" dur="5.14">wanted to do this without this</text>
  <text start="164.38" dur="4.2">and this would been a major major</text>
  <text start="166.78" dur="4.68">problem first of all it&amp;#39;s a violation of</text>
  <text start="168.58" dur="5.13">everyone&amp;#39;s rights but we continually see</text>
  <text start="171.46" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re trying to pass these laws that</text>
  <text start="173.71" dur="7.26">violate the people&amp;#39;s rights and nothing</text>
  <text start="177.61" dur="6.6">can go above and beyond the rights of</text>
  <text start="180.97" dur="6.6">the people no law but they continually</text>
  <text start="184.21" dur="5.73">try to do this in the name of emergency</text>
  <text start="187.57" dur="4.8">and the name of terrorism in the name of</text>
  <text start="189.94" dur="5.25">security they threw out all these words</text>
  <text start="192.37" dur="6.78">it&amp;#39;s all to protect you but we know that</text>
  <text start="195.19" dur="7.32">this is not the case in Chicago we</text>
  <text start="199.15" dur="8.85">talked about pre-crime minority report</text>
  <text start="202.51" dur="8.16">type style devices algorithms and</text>
  <text start="208" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re actually going to use it in</text>
  <text start="210.67" dur="6.36">Chicago and what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="213.88" dur="4.29">that this algorithm generates a list of</text>
  <text start="217.03" dur="3.9">people almost like in the minority</text>
  <text start="218.17" dur="4.89">report but they had I guess people that</text>
  <text start="220.93" dur="5.46">can see visions this is an algorithm</text>
  <text start="223.06" dur="6.93">which can generate a list of people from</text>
  <text start="226.39" dur="7.44">a police database and it will figure out</text>
  <text start="229.99" dur="6.36">who to target each individual on the</text>
  <text start="233.83" dur="5.1">list is provided a score based on</text>
  <text start="236.35" dur="5.16">arrests based on shootings affiliations</text>
  <text start="238.93" dur="4.35">with gangs and other variables the</text>
  <text start="241.51" dur="5.16">intent of the list is to predict who is</text>
  <text start="243.28" dur="6.72">next to be shot or shoot someone and</text>
  <text start="246.67" dur="5.94">once the list is updated the authorities</text>
  <text start="250" dur="5.04">then go and visit the individuals with</text>
  <text start="252.61" dur="4.77">the high scores at their homes the</text>
  <text start="255.04" dur="5.759">individuals are then told they are on</text>
  <text start="257.38" dur="6.87">the list hmm it&amp;#39;s nice how they have</text>
  <text start="260.799" dur="7.131">these lists and they will be monitored</text>
  <text start="264.25" dur="5.46">and tracked well civil liberty</text>
  <text start="267.93" dur="4.09">organizations are out there saying this</text>
  <text start="269.71" dur="4.83">is a violation of everyone&amp;#39;s rights they</text>
  <text start="272.02" dur="6.05">haven&amp;#39;t done anything they&amp;#39;re just put</text>
  <text start="274.54" dur="6.06">on a list and now they&amp;#39;re being followed</text>
  <text start="278.07" dur="5.95">think about it if your name popped up on</text>
  <text start="280.6" dur="7.74">a list and you see law enforcement</text>
  <text start="284.02" dur="6.95">following you all over the place this is</text>
  <text start="288.34" dur="5.99">not freedom this is a police state</text>
  <text start="290.97" dur="7.39">because you haven&amp;#39;t done anything yet</text>
  <text start="294.33" dur="7.899">they&amp;#39;re planning on you doing something</text>
  <text start="298.36" dur="7.95">because of this computerized algorithm</text>
  <text start="302.229" dur="7.081">but you actually haven&amp;#39;t look what our</text>
  <text start="306.31" dur="5.729">country is turning into and it&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="309.31" dur="8.669">that it&amp;#39;s in Chicago because Chicago is</text>
  <text start="312.039" dur="8.81">a free gun zone and they have the</text>
  <text start="317.979" dur="6.66">highest crime the highest shooting it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="320.849" dur="7.181">a complete disaster so I guess that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="324.639" dur="7.861">not really working out now there were</text>
  <text start="328.03" dur="8.4">leaked tapes in Brazil with a</text>
  <text start="332.5" dur="9.689">conversation with different individuals</text>
  <text start="336.43" dur="8.609">and it was individuals like the</text>
  <text start="342.189" dur="6.48">country&amp;#39;s planning minister Romero jukka</text>
  <text start="345.039" dur="7.041">and Sergio Mikado former CEO of</text>
  <text start="348.669" dur="6.06">state-owned oil company Petrobras and</text>
  <text start="352.08" dur="6.28">during the conversations they were</text>
  <text start="354.729" dur="6.511">orchestrating a legal coup against</text>
  <text start="358.36" dur="6.33">Rousseff some when we put all the pieces</text>
  <text start="361.24" dur="6.51">together and we see who these people met</text>
  <text start="364.69" dur="5.219">with tammer they met with individuals in</text>
  <text start="367.75" dur="5.639">the US government we have this leaked</text>
  <text start="369.909" dur="6.271">tape the whole entire thing was planned</text>
  <text start="373.389" dur="5.041">by the u.s. to remove the elected</text>
  <text start="376.18" dur="5.099">leaders to replace the elected leaders</text>
  <text start="378.43" dur="7.019">with people they want that are friendly</text>
  <text start="381.279" dur="6.211">to the US government to insert a central</text>
  <text start="385.449" dur="4.14">bank privately owned central bank that</text>
  <text start="387.49" dur="4.949">the u.s. can control to sell their oil</text>
  <text start="389.589" dur="4.86">using the dollar and we see this</text>
  <text start="392.439" dur="3.811">happening not just in Brazil we see it</text>
  <text start="394.449" dur="4.321">happening in Venezuela we see it</text>
  <text start="396.25" dur="4.439">happening in Argentina and we are</text>
  <text start="398.77" dur="5.1">continually seen this all over the world</text>
  <text start="400.689" dur="5.79">because the system needs to continually</text>
  <text start="403.87" dur="5.039">push debt out further and further this</text>
  <text start="406.479" dur="4.141">is the only way you can survive and this</text>
  <text start="408.909" dur="4.44">is not a system that our founding</text>
  <text start="410.62" dur="5.34">fathers wanted this is a central banking</text>
  <text start="413.349" dur="6.06">system that benefits them that helps the</text>
  <text start="415.96" dur="5.519">elite that helps the upper 1% become</text>
  <text start="419.409" dur="4.891">very very wealthy while the rest of the</text>
  <text start="421.479" dur="4.92">people are left in debt while the rest</text>
  <text start="424.3" dur="3.51">of the people are suffering and this is</text>
  <text start="426.399" dur="5.45">what we&amp;#39;re seeing I mean look at the</text>
  <text start="427.81" dur="5.809">countries like Libya Yemen Iraq</text>
  <text start="431.849" dur="5.55">Syria and they haven&amp;#39;t even completed</text>
  <text start="433.619" dur="7.32">Syria yet look at Ukraine every single</text>
  <text start="437.399" dur="9.66">one of these economies destroyed people</text>
  <text start="440.939" dur="11.641">suffering way of life horrific total</text>
  <text start="447.059" dur="8.79">destruction of their countries now out</text>
  <text start="452.58" dur="5.069">in Ukraine we know that the enormity for</text>
  <text start="455.849" dur="3.451">they were having a meeting and of course</text>
  <text start="457.649" dur="4.88">they all came to the conclusion that yes</text>
  <text start="459.3" dur="5.429">we must implement the Minsk deal in full</text>
  <text start="462.529" dur="5.04">now they&amp;#39;ve been saying this for a very</text>
  <text start="464.729" dur="4.83">long time and we know that Putin</text>
  <text start="467.569" dur="4.541">definitely wants to have them in steel</text>
  <text start="469.559" dur="5.72">fulfilled in full not too sure about</text>
  <text start="472.11" dur="5.789">Merkel or halong we know poroshenko</text>
  <text start="475.279" dur="3.67">absolutely not we know Victoria Nuland</text>
  <text start="477.899" dur="2.73">who wasn&amp;#39;t really in the meeting because</text>
  <text start="478.949" dur="3.24">she&amp;#39;s not part of it but she doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="480.629" dur="4.921">want this done we know the rest of the</text>
  <text start="482.189" dur="5.82">US government absolutely not now we know</text>
  <text start="485.55" dur="6.75">that poroshenko wants to bring in armed</text>
  <text start="488.009" dur="5.97">OSCE police well the people in Donetsk</text>
  <text start="492.3" dur="5.149">and Lugansk they have said absolutely</text>
  <text start="493.979" dur="8.011">not they do not want armed police in</text>
  <text start="497.449" dur="7.21">their areas they&amp;#39;re against any armed</text>
  <text start="501.99" dur="5.549">missions on the territory of Lugansk and</text>
  <text start="504.659" dur="4.65">Donetsk and they would consider such a</text>
  <text start="507.539" dur="5.04">move in intervention and that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="509.309" dur="6.001">what it is it would be an intervention</text>
  <text start="512.579" dur="5.221">in their area and eventually what would</text>
  <text start="515.31" dur="4.74">happen is these armed police would have</text>
  <text start="517.8" dur="5.429">been instructed to take control of the</text>
  <text start="520.05" dur="5.789">entire area and they were trying a back</text>
  <text start="523.229" dur="5.131">to her approach with this but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="525.839" dur="4.85">think it&amp;#39;s going to work now we know</text>
  <text start="528.36" dur="7.05">that Obama he went out and he visited</text>
  <text start="530.689" dur="7.811">Vietnam and we know that Vietnam had a</text>
  <text start="535.41" dur="6.96">50-year ban on the US selling them arms</text>
  <text start="538.5" dur="5.43">and of course Congress is sitting here</text>
  <text start="542.37" dur="3.659">going well they have a human rights</text>
  <text start="543.93" dur="4.23">issue and we see all over the corporate</text>
  <text start="546.029" dur="4.951">media Obama is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="548.16" dur="6.75">Vietnam has to improve its human rights</text>
  <text start="550.98" dur="7.32">issues they need to come up to standards</text>
  <text start="554.91" dur="5.31">that the world expects and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="558.3" dur="4.32">interesting about all of this is that he</text>
  <text start="560.22" dur="5.07">already made the deal would Vietnam and</text>
  <text start="562.62" dur="4.26">now is backtracking and say</text>
  <text start="565.29" dur="3.299">that Vietnam has to do this and you know</text>
  <text start="566.88" dur="3.78">that they&amp;#39;re not going to do this</text>
  <text start="568.589" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re just going to use this</text>
  <text start="570.66" dur="4.109">propaganda that yes we&amp;#39;re telling them</text>
  <text start="572.759" dur="5.491">but in the background we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="574.769" dur="5.31">selling them arms now what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="578.25" dur="4.079">is that the first thing they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="580.079" dur="6.12">sell Vietnam once the embargo is lifted</text>
  <text start="582.329" dur="5.341">will be p3 Orion patrol aircraft and the</text>
  <text start="586.199" dur="3.841">second thing they&amp;#39;re going to give them</text>
  <text start="587.67" dur="5.339">as c-130 Hercules transport aircrafts</text>
  <text start="590.04" dur="4.469">the lockheed p-3 orion is an</text>
  <text start="593.009" dur="3.121">anti-submarine as well as a maritime</text>
  <text start="594.509" dur="4.651">surveillance aircraft which is capable</text>
  <text start="596.13" dur="4.73">of detecting and striking submarines as</text>
  <text start="599.16" dur="5.82">well as engaging in anti-surface warfare</text>
  <text start="600.86" dur="5.919">again ships the c-130 Hercules that is</text>
  <text start="604.98" dur="5.19">used as a military transport aircraft</text>
  <text start="606.779" dur="8.49">but also can be used for airborne</text>
  <text start="610.17" dur="8.07">assault and as a gunship and this is</text>
  <text start="615.269" dur="8.581">just the beginning because their real</text>
  <text start="618.24" dur="9.839">agenda is to complete the circle around</text>
  <text start="623.85" dur="8.19">China to contain China this is what</text>
  <text start="628.079" dur="8.88">they&amp;#39;re actually doing now Kerry is out</text>
  <text start="632.04" dur="10.849">there and he is saying that Russia needs</text>
  <text start="636.959" dur="9.901">to persuade Syria to stop the illegal</text>
  <text start="642.889" dur="8.351">strikes against targeted civilians in</text>
  <text start="646.86" dur="7.08">Syria now of course we know that this is</text>
  <text start="651.24" dur="6.719">not happening we know this is propaganda</text>
  <text start="653.94" dur="8.07">and they&amp;#39;re saying that Russia has a</text>
  <text start="657.959" dur="6.841">special responsibility and must control</text>
  <text start="662.01" dur="4.939">Assad so it looks like the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="664.8" dur="5.37">trying to turn this around and make</text>
  <text start="666.949" dur="7.661">Russia responsible for what Assad is</text>
  <text start="670.17" dur="7.229">doing at the same time it has been</text>
  <text start="674.61" dur="6.839">proven and shown over and over that the</text>
  <text start="677.399" dur="6.54">US has been hitting civilians their</text>
  <text start="681.449" dur="5.161">terrorist organizations have been</text>
  <text start="683.939" dur="5.33">killing civilians they&amp;#39;ve been bombing</text>
  <text start="686.61" dur="7.62">the infrastructure they&amp;#39;ve been bombing</text>
  <text start="689.269" dur="6.611">hospitals and this all turns back to</text>
  <text start="694.23" dur="4.829">what the US is doing but they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="695.88" dur="7.009">to spin this and trying to get Russia</text>
  <text start="699.059" dur="6.54">as the controlling factor over Assad and</text>
  <text start="702.889" dur="4.87">this way they can hold Assad and Russia</text>
  <text start="705.599" dur="4.08">together for what is happening which</text>
  <text start="707.759" dur="6.39">it&amp;#39;s not happening at all but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="709.679" dur="8.91">just using this as propaganda so we see</text>
  <text start="714.149" dur="6.72">right now there is operation raka we see</text>
  <text start="718.589" dur="4.86">these syrian democratic forces they have</text>
  <text start="720.869" dur="6.18">launched a large-scale three-pronged</text>
  <text start="723.449" dur="6.06">offensive to liberate this city this is</text>
  <text start="727.049" dur="5.94">the third largest city and we know that</text>
  <text start="729.509" dur="6.39">the u.s. is going to try to defend it</text>
  <text start="732.989" dur="5.31">and of course they&amp;#39;re not defending it</text>
