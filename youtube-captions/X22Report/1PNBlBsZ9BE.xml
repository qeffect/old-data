  <text start="45.79" dur="6.36">Romania let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="49.66" dur="6.68">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="52.15" dur="7.53">now I have said this in the past and I</text>
  <text start="56.34" dur="6.969">will continue to say this the US</text>
  <text start="59.68" dur="6.08">government they have a huge problem and</text>
  <text start="63.309" dur="4.861">the problem is lying to the people</text>
  <text start="65.76" dur="3.219">especially administration and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="68.17" dur="2.46">just talking about the Obama</text>
  <text start="68.979" dur="5.041">administration we go back throughout</text>
  <text start="70.63" dur="6.39">time all the US government</text>
  <text start="74.02" dur="7.44">administrations they just can&amp;#39;t tell the</text>
  <text start="77.02" dur="6.9">truth and they seem to always lie to the</text>
  <text start="81.46" dur="5.85">people because you have to remember that</text>
  <text start="83.92" dur="6.269">what they do is in their benefit and not</text>
  <text start="87.31" dur="7.22">a benefit to the people and we can see</text>
  <text start="90.189" dur="6.631">that Obama again has lied to the people</text>
  <text start="94.53" dur="6.78">Treasury officials they&amp;#39;ve confirmed</text>
  <text start="96.82" dur="8.45">that Obama lied and in fact yes that</text>
  <text start="101.31" dur="7.35">currency that was delivered to Iran on</text>
  <text start="105.27" dur="5.68">pallets the 400 million in different</text>
  <text start="108.66" dur="6.22">currencies and different denominations</text>
  <text start="110.95" dur="6.87">that was a payoff for the hostages for</text>
  <text start="114.88" dur="4.77">four of the hostages it was really think</text>
  <text start="117.82" dur="3.81">about it if this was part of the deal</text>
  <text start="119.65" dur="4.83">that they&amp;#39;ve been talking about they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="121.63" dur="5.58">been working with Iran and this was</text>
  <text start="124.48" dur="5.999">their money they would do an electronic</text>
  <text start="127.21" dur="7.109">transfer you wouldn&amp;#39;t give them a pallet</text>
  <text start="130.479" dur="6.9">of cash the reason why you give a pallet</text>
  <text start="134.319" dur="5.581">of cash it&amp;#39;s because you don&amp;#39;t want it</text>
  <text start="137.379" dur="5.22">to be traced you don&amp;#39;t want anyone to</text>
  <text start="139.9" dur="6.839">know about it you want it to be off the</text>
  <text start="142.599" dur="5.97">books and this is exactly what has been</text>
  <text start="146.739" dur="3.691">done here I mean if it looks like a</text>
  <text start="148.569" dur="7.221">ransom talks like a ransom</text>
  <text start="150.43" dur="5.36">it&amp;#39;s a ransom that&amp;#39;s exactly what it is</text>
  <text start="155.849" dur="4.281">now</text>
  <text start="157.58" dur="4.5">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is Obama the</text>
  <text start="160.13" dur="3.63">administration many of the people in</text>
  <text start="162.08" dur="3.63">Congress they keep pushing gun control</text>
  <text start="163.76" dur="4.08">gun control gun control we have to take</text>
  <text start="165.71" dur="3.54">the weapons away from the people now</text>
  <text start="167.84" dur="4.62">according to the Department of Defense</text>
  <text start="169.25" dur="5.19">security cooperation agency during the</text>
  <text start="172.46" dur="4.65">first six years in office the Obama</text>
  <text start="174.44" dur="4.86">administration entered into agreements</text>
  <text start="177.11" dur="8.91">to sell more than a hundred and ninety</text>
  <text start="179.3" dur="8.19">billion in weapons worldwide the</text>
  <text start="186.02" dur="3.06">director of the arms and security</text>
  <text start="187.49" dur="4.98">project at the center of international</text>
  <text start="189.08" dur="7.5">policy William D Hart Tong States the</text>
  <text start="192.47" dur="6.53">figure is higher than any other US</text>
  <text start="196.58" dur="5.46">administration since World War two</text>
  <text start="199" dur="4.72">perhaps that is why the Nobel Secretary</text>
  <text start="202.04" dur="3.48">has voiced serious regrets about</text>
  <text start="203.72" dur="7.56">awarding the Peace Prize to the</text>
  <text start="205.52" dur="9.06">President and we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="211.28" dur="7.23">reason the Obama administration was</text>
  <text start="214.58" dur="7.59">allowed to sell more weapons is because</text>
  <text start="218.51" dur="6.54">back in 2013 the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="222.17" dur="5.67">loosened controls over military exports</text>
  <text start="225.05" dur="4.86">so military equipment could be sent to</text>
  <text start="227.84" dur="7.619">almost any country in the world with</text>
  <text start="229.91" dur="8.04">little oversight u.s. companies began to</text>
  <text start="235.459" dur="5.131">enjoy fewer checks than they had in the</text>
  <text start="237.95" dur="4.71">past for example thanks to the Obama</text>
  <text start="240.59" dur="4.14">administration weapons manufacturers can</text>
  <text start="242.66" dur="4.47">now send military parts to most regions</text>
  <text start="244.73" dur="4.77">of the world without a license hmm very</text>
  <text start="247.13" dur="6.75">interesting which makes it easier for</text>
  <text start="249.5" dur="7.65">companies to extend their markets even</text>
  <text start="253.88" dur="9.2">to countries that are on the UN arms</text>
  <text start="257.15" dur="8.85">embargo list now how is this possible</text>
  <text start="263.08" dur="6.13">because once an item is approved for</text>
  <text start="266" dur="6.72">that exemption there may no longer be</text>
  <text start="269.21" dur="5.79">any ongoing country specific human</text>
  <text start="272.72" dur="6.86">rights review as had been conducted</text>
  <text start="275" dur="6.96">previously so we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="279.58" dur="4.12">they&amp;#39;re asking the people to give up</text>
  <text start="281.96" dur="3.78">their weapons but they&amp;#39;re selling more</text>
  <text start="283.7" dur="7.32">weapons to countries around the world</text>
  <text start="285.74" dur="9.75">with fewer checks without a license</text>
  <text start="291.02" dur="7.08">and he sold more weapons than any other</text>
  <text start="295.49" dur="4.64">administration since world war ii simply</text>
  <text start="298.1" dur="6.289">amazing</text>
  <text start="300.13" dur="8.59">now out in Afghanistan we understand</text>
  <text start="304.389" dur="5.71">Obama again lied to the people he was</text>
  <text start="308.72" dur="4.169">supposed to be bringing all the troops</text>
  <text start="310.099" dur="4.29">home and all of a sudden the troops have</text>
  <text start="312.889" dur="3.261">to stay well we knew this was gonna</text>
  <text start="314.389" dur="3.661">happen we talked about it quite a bit</text>
  <text start="316.15" dur="5.049">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="318.05" dur="5.73">Afghanistan is how they manipulate the</text>
  <text start="321.199" dur="5.641">numbers and how they really don&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="323.78" dur="5.49">you what&amp;#39;s really going on because when</text>
  <text start="326.84" dur="5.22">they tell you there&amp;#39;s only say 10,000</text>
  <text start="329.27" dur="6.06">troops in Afghanistan well they leave</text>
  <text start="332.06" dur="5.76">out the paid contractors and this is how</text>
  <text start="335.33" dur="6.53">they get around everything because right</text>
  <text start="337.82" dur="9.14">now in Afghanistan the US have about</text>
  <text start="341.86" dur="8.709">29,000 contractors in the country and</text>
  <text start="346.96" dur="5.049">two-thirds of the contractors their</text>
  <text start="350.569" dur="3.931">foreign nationals basically these are</text>
  <text start="352.009" dur="6.211">paid mercenaries it&amp;#39;s the same groups</text>
  <text start="354.5" dur="6.93">that they use in Syria because you have</text>
  <text start="358.22" dur="4.86">to remember in the peak of the Afghan</text>
  <text start="361.43" dur="3.75">war where the US had about eighty eight</text>
  <text start="363.08" dur="4.47">eighty eight thousand troops there were</text>
  <text start="365.18" dur="8.64">a hundred and seventeen thousand paid</text>
  <text start="367.55" dur="8.31">mercenaries in that country so we are</text>
  <text start="373.82" dur="5.25">much more involved in these countries</text>
  <text start="375.86" dur="4.35">than they lead us to believe and they</text>
  <text start="379.07" dur="4.5">feel if they just leave the information</text>
  <text start="380.21" dur="5.07">out of the picture they&amp;#39;re not lying but</text>
  <text start="383.57" dur="3.89">we&amp;#39;re really not getting the full story</text>
  <text start="385.28" dur="4.229">of what&amp;#39;s going on just like in Iraq</text>
  <text start="387.46" dur="3.489">where they say oh there&amp;#39;s only four</text>
  <text start="389.509" dur="3.481">thousand two hundred and fifty troops</text>
  <text start="390.949" dur="3.21">that are permanently in Iraq because</text>
  <text start="392.99" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s the agreement that they have with</text>
  <text start="394.159" dur="4.471">the Iraqis that they can&amp;#39;t have more</text>
  <text start="396.74" dur="4.56">than that number of permanent troops but</text>
  <text start="398.63" dur="6.569">they forget to tell you there&amp;#39;s 8,000</text>
  <text start="401.3" dur="6.929">temporary troops where they bring them</text>
  <text start="405.199" dur="5.19">in and they&amp;#39;re supposed to expire after</text>
  <text start="408.229" dur="7.381">a certain period of time but they leave</text>
  <text start="410.389" dur="7.46">the expiration period off and those</text>
  <text start="415.61" dur="5.279">troops their time doesn&amp;#39;t expire and</text>
  <text start="417.849" dur="6.481">sometimes they rotate them and then they</text>
  <text start="420.889" dur="5.21">have the paid contractors on top of that</text>
  <text start="424.33" dur="4.709">so they forget to tell everyone about</text>
  <text start="426.099" dur="5.28">that so everyone believes that oh we</text>
  <text start="429.039" dur="4.321">only have about 4000 so troops in Iraq</text>
  <text start="431.379" dur="4.711">and throughout the rest of the Middle</text>
  <text start="433.36" dur="8.16">East but no we have you know hundreds of</text>
  <text start="436.09" dur="9.69">thousands of troops in these areas we</text>
  <text start="441.52" dur="7.22">see out in Afghanistan the US Air Force</text>
  <text start="445.78" dur="7.949">chief of staff general David Goldfine</text>
  <text start="448.74" dur="9.19">announced that b-52s well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="453.729" dur="6.53">bombing again in Afghanistan and this is</text>
  <text start="457.93" dur="5.459">the first time in ten years</text>
  <text start="460.259" dur="5.5">he said b-52s they&amp;#39;re bombing and</text>
  <text start="463.389" dur="4.321">Afghanistan they&amp;#39;re bombing in Iraq and</text>
  <text start="465.759" dur="4.861">we have to remember what is going on</text>
  <text start="467.71" dur="5.07">there they&amp;#39;re not going after the</text>
  <text start="470.62" dur="6.269">terrorists they&amp;#39;re going after those</text>
  <text start="472.78" dur="5.729">individuals who are against the US</text>
  <text start="476.889" dur="3.74">government being in their country</text>
  <text start="478.509" dur="6.81">they&amp;#39;re against the puppet governments</text>
  <text start="480.629" dur="10.271">they&amp;#39;re against what is happening there</text>
  <text start="485.319" dur="7.551">and the u.s. calls them terrorists and I</text>
  <text start="490.9" dur="5.37">explained this many many times before so</text>
  <text start="492.87" dur="5.199">briefly when the US wants to overthrow a</text>
  <text start="496.27" dur="4.11">government they use terrorists like Al</text>
  <text start="498.069" dur="3.9">Qaeda Islamic state al-nusra to</text>
  <text start="500.38" dur="3.5">overthrow the government once the</text>
  <text start="501.969" dur="4.13">government is overthrown and this is</text>
  <text start="503.88" dur="5.219">especially the case in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="506.099" dur="6.011">because of the authorization for War Act</text>
  <text start="509.099" dur="5.68">they they switch it around and they say</text>
  <text start="512.11" dur="4.26">uh all those people now since we have</text>
  <text start="514.779" dur="3.3">the puppet government in place those</text>
  <text start="516.37" dur="4.229">people who want the puppet government</text>
  <text start="518.079" dur="4.32">out of their country those are the</text>
  <text start="520.599" dur="5.101">terrorists we will call them al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="522.399" dur="5.55">and we can use drones to bomb them so</text>
  <text start="525.7" dur="5.1">they switch it around and they use these</text>
  <text start="527.949" dur="6.061">terms whenever they need them but</text>
  <text start="530.8" dur="5.729">they&amp;#39;re not al-qaeda they&amp;#39;re people who</text>
  <text start="534.01" dur="4.319">don&amp;#39;t want the u.s. in their country</text>
  <text start="536.529" dur="5.701">they don&amp;#39;t want this puppet government</text>
  <text start="538.329" dur="5.37">in their country because the people they</text>
  <text start="542.23" dur="2.849">didn&amp;#39;t have a choice</text>
  <text start="543.699" dur="4.171">think about what&amp;#39;s happening in Libya</text>
  <text start="545.079" dur="5.581">the u.s. stepped in with the UN and the</text>
  <text start="547.87" dur="5.339">coalition forces and said hey this is</text>
  <text start="550.66" dur="4.41">your government oh you can&amp;#39;t choose it</text>
  <text start="553.209" dur="4.051">we chose it for you and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="555.07" dur="2.97">call it the unity government the people</text>
  <text start="557.26" dur="4.35">didn&amp;#39;t have the same</text>
  <text start="558.04" dur="6.599">and this is exactly what is happening in</text>
  <text start="561.61" dur="4.62">each one of these countries and this is</text>
  <text start="564.639" dur="4.111">going to continue on and this is why the</text>
  <text start="566.23" dur="5.52">u.s. is having such a big problem around</text>
  <text start="568.75" dur="5.61">the world this is why the US has to</text>
  <text start="571.75" dur="4.98">continually bring in the forces into</text>
  <text start="574.36" dur="5.37">this area and continually bomb and go</text>
  <text start="576.73" dur="7.589">back into these countries because the</text>
  <text start="579.73" dur="7.2">people they haven&amp;#39;t decided on who their</text>
  <text start="584.319" dur="6.541">government is going to be and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="586.93" dur="9.089">fighting to get their freedom back from</text>
  <text start="590.86" dur="8.07">the US now out in Ukraine the situation</text>
  <text start="596.019" dur="5.041">is deteriorating very very quickly and I</text>
  <text start="598.93" dur="4.11">see here in the United States the</text>
  <text start="601.06" dur="5.16">corporate media they&amp;#39;re really pushing</text>
  <text start="603.04" dur="5.099">the idea that Russia is getting ready to</text>
  <text start="606.22" dur="5.52">attack I mean from Newsweek they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="608.139" dur="6.271">running the propaganda that the Ukraine</text>
  <text start="611.74" dur="5.459">rebels they&amp;#39;re continually firing a</text>
  <text start="614.41" dur="6.239">hundred times in one day</text>
  <text start="617.199" dur="5.811">at the Ukrainian forces but they forgot</text>
  <text start="620.649" dur="7.201">to tell you the other part of the story</text>
  <text start="623.01" dur="8.05">where the OSCE reported that the rebels</text>
  <text start="627.85" dur="5.25">were returning fire because Kiev they</text>
  <text start="631.06" dur="4.92">shelled a hundred and thirteen times</text>
  <text start="633.1" dur="6.21">into the dom bass area they always like</text>
  <text start="635.98" dur="7.71">to leave that little part out we see</text>
  <text start="639.31" dur="8.79">that poroshenko is out there and he is</text>
  <text start="643.69" dur="8.75">warning that there could be a full-scale</text>
  <text start="648.1" dur="8.429">Russian invasion and he might have to</text>
  <text start="652.44" dur="6.16">institute a military draft if the</text>
  <text start="656.529" dur="4.321">situation worsens so he&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="658.6" dur="4.83">warning the people that he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="660.85" dur="4.349">start the draft once again he&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="663.43" dur="4.11">telling people telegraphing everyone</text>
  <text start="665.199" dur="3.781">that he&amp;#39;s going to be starting this war</text>
  <text start="667.54" dur="2.97">because this is what they do this is how</text>
  <text start="668.98" dur="3.409">they built up the propaganda we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="670.51" dur="3.84">seeing it in the corporate media</text>
  <text start="672.389" dur="3.43">poroshenko is continually out there</text>
  <text start="674.35" dur="2.909">saying Russia is building up troops</text>
  <text start="675.819" dur="4.801">they&amp;#39;re going to be attacking the</text>
  <text start="677.259" dur="9.02">question is why would Russia do this it</text>
  <text start="680.62" dur="8.79">makes no sense whatsoever the reason why</text>
  <text start="686.279" dur="5.621">Ukraine is going to do this is because</text>
  <text start="689.41" dur="5.67">they want the southeastern area</text>
  <text start="691.9" dur="8.16">they want Crimea Russia doesn&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="695.08" dur="8.09">West never did they never invaded they</text>
  <text start="700.06" dur="8.19">never had troops inside of Ukraine</text>
  <text start="703.17" dur="6.88">moving towards Kiev if this was true the</text>
  <text start="708.25" dur="6.06">united states government central bankers</text>
  <text start="710.05" dur="6.42">NATO Europe you would see so many</text>
  <text start="714.31" dur="5.55">satellite imagery and I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="716.47" dur="8.34">the full-color 3d imagery all over the</text>
  <text start="719.86" dur="7.11">place but they can&amp;#39;t produce it because</text>
  <text start="724.81" dur="5.76">they can&amp;#39;t find the troops they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="726.97" dur="6.18">there I mean they tried in the past they</text>

  <text start="740.5" dur="4.74">of the congressmen used or Ukraine used</text>
  <text start="743.89" dur="2.93">and they were trying to convince the</text>
  <text start="745.24" dur="5.19">world that this is what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="746.82" dur="5.8">again it was fake phony and false so we</text>
  <text start="750.43" dur="4.59">can see right now that the situation is</text>
  <text start="752.62" dur="5.52">getting a lot worse he also went on to</text>
  <text start="755.02" dur="6.18">say that he did not rule out introducing</text>
  <text start="758.14" dur="4.35">martial law in Ukraine so we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="761.2" dur="3.06">have to watch this situation very</text>
  <text start="762.49" dur="5.84">carefully because normally what happens</text>
  <text start="764.26" dur="7.02">is they push the propaganda right before</text>
  <text start="768.33" dur="5.23">something big happens and they have to</text>
  <text start="771.28" dur="4.71">make it look like the southeastern</text>
  <text start="773.56" dur="5.73">people the rebels someone in Crimea</text>
  <text start="775.99" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re the ones who actually started it</text>
  <text start="779.29" dur="3.66">now if they don&amp;#39;t start it don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="781.18" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;ll create some type of false flag</text>
  <text start="782.95" dur="4.47">to convince everyone that this is what</text>
  <text start="785.53" dur="5.28">this is what has happened and this is</text>
  <text start="787.42" dur="5.55">what we need to watch we see the Syrian</text>
  <text start="790.81" dur="5.37">democratic forces which is the moderate</text>
  <text start="792.97" dur="5.94">rebels they&amp;#39;re continually seizing</text>
  <text start="796.18" dur="4.8">villages in the northern area of Syria</text>
  <text start="798.91" dur="4.5">wherever the Islamic state is we see</text>
  <text start="800.98" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re continually taking those areas</text>
  <text start="803.41" dur="5.28">because what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="804.94" dur="8.22">carving Syria up right now that is their</text>
  <text start="808.69" dur="7.56">agenda very slowly very methodically</text>
  <text start="813.16" dur="5.07">manipulating what Syria is going to look</text>
  <text start="816.25" dur="4.44">like and if they can capture all these</text>
  <text start="818.23" dur="4.26">regions and say this is the Kurdish</text>
  <text start="820.69" dur="3.54">region they&amp;#39;re going to try to make</text>
  <text start="822.49" dur="3.12">their move and say ah this is going to</text>
  <text start="824.23" dur="3.54">be separate and apart</text>
  <text start="825.61" dur="5.18">from Syria and this is really what the</text>
  <text start="827.77" dur="5.82">u.s. their entire strategy is right now</text>
  <text start="830.79" dur="5.89">we see Russia has increased their</text>
  <text start="833.59" dur="5.91">bombing because the West has given more</text>
  <text start="836.68" dur="6.36">aid to the terrorists the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="839.5" dur="5.7">al-qaeda al-nusra and this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="843.04" dur="5.73">seeing Russia increase the bombing runs</text>
  <text start="845.2" dur="6.21">inside of Syria they&amp;#39;re hitting all of</text>
  <text start="848.77" dur="4.65">the groups because they see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="851.41" dur="5.37">continually getting rearmed during these</text>
  <text start="853.42" dur="4.56">humanitarian deliveries because the</text>
  <text start="856.78" dur="3">United States is not delivering</text>
  <text start="857.98" dur="4.61">humanitarian aid they&amp;#39;re delivering</text>
  <text start="859.78" dur="5.88">weapons they&amp;#39;re delivering ammunition</text>
  <text start="862.59" dur="5.29">they&amp;#39;re giving them supplies this is why</text>
  <text start="865.66" dur="6.63">they keep calling for humanitarian aid</text>
  <text start="867.88" dur="7.05">on the other hand Russia Syria they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="872.29" dur="6.9">actually bringing humanitarian aid to</text>
  <text start="874.93" dur="7.47">the people helping them now we see the</text>
  <text start="879.19" dur="7.89">situation in Turkey it is deteriorating</text>
  <text start="882.4" dur="5.13">with the US and what is happening right</text>
  <text start="887.08" dur="3.33">now</text>
  <text start="887.53" dur="5.51">since the coup d&amp;#39;etat turkey is getting</text>
  <text start="890.41" dur="5.46">closer and closer to Russia and Iran and</text>
  <text start="893.04" dur="5.23">the situation with the u.s. it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="895.87" dur="5.28">worse and worse and right now it looks</text>
  <text start="898.27" dur="5.58">like the u.s. they are moving their</text>
  <text start="901.15" dur="7.86">nuclear weapons out of turkey into</text>
  <text start="903.85" dur="6.81">Romania and euro active which cites two</text>
  <text start="909.01" dur="3.56">independent sources the US has started</text>
  <text start="910.66" dur="5.33">transferring these nuclear weapons and</text>
  <text start="912.57" dur="7.78">they&amp;#39;re moving them out of the area and</text>
  <text start="915.99" dur="6.25">during this same period of time Turkey</text>
  <text start="920.35" dur="5.49">and Iran they have reached an agreement</text>
  <text start="922.24" dur="4.98">on the conditions for peace in Syria</text>
  <text start="925.84" dur="3.99">where they&amp;#39;re going to be working</text>
  <text start="927.22" dur="4.29">together now we&amp;#39;re still looking for</text>
  <text start="929.83" dur="5.61">other indicators because we want to see</text>
  <text start="931.51" dur="10.59">turkey shut down its borders we want to</text>
  <text start="935.44" dur="9">see Russia using the Incirlik airbase we</text>
  <text start="942.1" dur="5.58">want to see turkey actually cooperating</text>
  <text start="944.44" dur="6.6">with Russia and Iran and once all this</text>
  <text start="947.68" dur="6.66">starts we can see at that point that the</text>
  <text start="951.04" dur="5.1">situation for the u.s. is going to get</text>
  <text start="954.34" dur="3.09">worse and worse and when I say the US</text>
  <text start="956.14" dur="3.27">I&amp;#39;m talking about the US government I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="957.43" dur="3.779">not talking about the people of the</text>
  <text start="959.41" dur="6">States talking about the elite the</text>
  <text start="961.209" dur="6.21">neocons the central bankers and we see</text>
  <text start="965.41" dur="2.969">once their backs are against the wall</text>
  <text start="967.419" dur="3.81">and I&amp;#39;m talking about the US government</text>
  <text start="968.379" dur="5.31">central bankers they&amp;#39;re going to lash</text>
  <text start="971.229" dur="5.25">out they&amp;#39;re not gonna sit quietly and</text>
  <text start="973.689" dur="5.58">just let this happen and we can see</text>
  <text start="976.479" dur="5.85">during the month of August or prior to</text>
  <text start="979.269" dur="7.05">the month of August we saw the coup</text>
  <text start="982.329" dur="6.59">d&amp;#39;etat in Turkey one event we saw a huge</text>
  <text start="986.319" dur="6.72">amount of terrorists moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="988.919" dur="7.23">this huge buildup in Aleppo for their</text>
  <text start="993.039" dur="7.23">offensive they tried it twice it failed</text>
  <text start="996.149" dur="7.3">we see in Ukraine the US was</text>
  <text start="1000.269" dur="5.76">orchestrating some type of terrorist act</text>
  <text start="1003.449" dur="5.4">in Crimea to destroy the infrastructure</text>
  <text start="1006.029" dur="5.31">that has failed so when we look at the</text>
  <text start="1008.849" dur="5.01">month of August we&amp;#39;ve seen many</text>
  <text start="1011.339" dur="5.12">different events and is this gonna slow</text>
  <text start="1013.859" dur="4.98">up is this just gonna stop and end no</text>
  <text start="1016.459" dur="5.05">because the United States government</text>
  <text start="1018.839" dur="6.09">central bankers they have one goal and</text>
  <text start="1021.509" dur="6.63">they like to reach that goal no matter</text>
  <text start="1024.929" dur="4.95">what it&amp;#39;s like they have blinders on and</text>
  <text start="1028.139" dur="3.961">all they can see is that flashing light</text>
  <text start="1029.879" dur="4.741">ahead and they have to go towards the</text>
  <text start="1032.1" dur="4.62">light and this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1034.62" dur="5.219">seeing right now so we can expect</text>
  <text start="1036.72" dur="6.959">something else to occur most likely in</text>
  <text start="1039.839" dur="8.31">the next couple of weeks now we</text>
  <text start="1043.679" dur="9.45">understand the situation around the</text>
  <text start="1048.149" dur="7.831">world is heating up things are not</text>
  <text start="1053.129" dur="4.971">looking good we see the banking systems</text>
  <text start="1055.98" dur="5.279">they&amp;#39;re deteriorating very very quickly</text>
  <text start="1058.1" dur="6.699">we see the countries throughout Europe</text>
  <text start="1061.259" dur="5.731">the economies are imploding we see the</text>
  <text start="1064.799" dur="4.681">United States the illusion of the</text>
  <text start="1066.99" dur="5.819">economy doing well well that&amp;#39;s what it</text>
  <text start="1069.48" dur="7.559">is it&amp;#39;s an illusion and we can see what</text>
  <text start="1072.809" dur="7.261">is going to happen to this country and</text>
  <text start="1077.039" dur="6.99">other countries when the economic crisis</text>
  <text start="1080.07" dur="6.349">hits and we see it firsthand when we</text>
  <text start="1084.029" dur="6.661">look at what is happening in Venezuela</text>
  <text start="1086.419" dur="6.761">and we can get some clues about which</text>
  <text start="1090.69" dur="6.06">items are going to disappear first</text>
  <text start="1093.18" dur="7.02">during a major national emergency so</text>
  <text start="1096.75" dur="8.13">when we look at the situation in</text>
  <text start="1100.2" dur="6.42">Venezuela we can see what is there what</text>
  <text start="1104.88" dur="4.14">is not there now is this going to be</text>
  <text start="1106.62" dur="4.89">exactly the same no but we can get some</text>
  <text start="1109.02" dur="4.5">ideas the people still can get</text>
  <text start="1111.51" dur="5.58">vegetables and fruits but there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1113.52" dur="6.84">milk very little cereal and the only</text>
  <text start="1117.09" dur="6.12">meat they can get is sausage cornmeal</text>

  <text start="1133.5" dur="9.42">deodorant they can&amp;#39;t find it it&amp;#39;s gone</text>
  <text start="1138.11" dur="7.15">those things have disappeared and we</text>
  <text start="1142.92" dur="6.03">should be thinking about this as we</text>
  <text start="1145.26" dur="6.06">prepare for what is coming other items</text>
  <text start="1148.95" dur="5.61">that everyone should have flashlights</text>
