  <text start="74.25" dur="6.66">point we&amp;#39;ve been watching the economy</text>
  <text start="77.57" dur="5.049">deteriorate to the downside and as we</text>
  <text start="80.91" dur="3.3">continually look at these economic</text>
  <text start="82.619" dur="3.36">indicators we realized that the</text>
  <text start="84.21" dur="4.65">situation is just getting worse and</text>
  <text start="85.979" dur="7.28">worse as time goes on when we look at</text>
  <text start="88.86" dur="6.71">truck shipment this is deteriorating</text>
  <text start="93.259" dur="6.031">dramatically I mean it&amp;#39;s unbelievable</text>
  <text start="95.57" dur="8.799">when we look at shipping truck shipments</text>
  <text start="99.29" dur="9.929">we see in June of 2016 they are down for</text>
  <text start="104.369" dur="10.11">as June of 2015 jun 2014 june of 2013</text>
  <text start="109.219" dur="9.881">june of 2012 june of 2011 and almost but</text>
  <text start="114.479" dur="7.17">not quite like june of 2010 and what</text>
  <text start="119.1" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;re seeing is a system that is</text>
  <text start="121.649" dur="4.07">completely breaking down and it all</text>
  <text start="123.24" dur="5.67">makes sense if you really think about it</text>
  <text start="125.719" dur="6.101">because the shipments well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="128.91" dur="5.4">declining and we have to go all the way</text>
  <text start="131.82" dur="4.32">back to people not working if people</text>
  <text start="134.31" dur="3.48">aren&amp;#39;t working people are purchasing</text>
  <text start="136.14" dur="5.159">they don&amp;#39;t have the funds that go out to</text>
  <text start="137.79" dur="6.68">retail retail they don&amp;#39;t need to order</text>
  <text start="141.299" dur="6.571">new goods factory orders are down</text>
  <text start="144.47" dur="6.67">manufacturing is declining and then we</text>
  <text start="147.87" dur="6.869">get rail and truck shipments those will</text>
  <text start="151.14" dur="6.599">also decline so what we can see is all</text>
  <text start="154.739" dur="6.71">these pieces they&amp;#39;re all fitting</text>
  <text start="157.739" dur="6.031">together showing that this economy is</text>
  <text start="161.449" dur="5.591">declining and declining very</text>
  <text start="163.77" dur="5.16">very quickly it&amp;#39;s not improving like the</text>
  <text start="167.04" dur="4.47">US government and the Fed has told us</text>
  <text start="168.93" dur="4.74">they use a lot of manipulation to make</text>
  <text start="171.51" dur="4.32">it seem like it is improving but when we</text>
  <text start="173.67" dur="7.89">look at the real hard economic</text>
  <text start="175.83" dur="8.28">information it shows that the government</text>
  <text start="181.56" dur="6.12">the Fed they are lying to the people</text>
  <text start="184.11" dur="5.85">once again and yesterday Friday when</text>
  <text start="187.68" dur="4.04">James Bullard came out and said listen</text>
  <text start="189.96" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;re not forecasting any type of</text>
  <text start="191.72" dur="5.26">recession or downside or anything like</text>
  <text start="194.64" dur="4.62">this he said this back in august of two</text>
  <text start="196.98" dur="6.9">thousand eight and what did we see in</text>
  <text start="199.26" dur="5.85">october of 2008 the entire economy</text>
  <text start="203.88" dur="4.26">crashed while they&amp;#39;re repeating the same</text>
  <text start="205.11" dur="5.91">exact message and here we are today now</text>
  <text start="208.14" dur="5.43">eighty-one percent of americans they</text>
  <text start="211.02" dur="6.03">believe we are worse off now than ten</text>
  <text start="213.57" dur="5.04">years ago and it is true for those</text>
  <text start="217.05" dur="4.77">people who are struggling trying to make</text>
  <text start="218.61" dur="5.73">it every single day without jobs or jobs</text>
  <text start="221.82" dur="4.02">that have been reduced in salary because</text>
  <text start="224.34" dur="3.51">they all they can do is find a part-time</text>
  <text start="225.84" dur="4.92">job it is very difficult for those</text>
  <text start="227.85" dur="5.82">people and we know as we move forward</text>
  <text start="230.76" dur="5.34">here it&amp;#39;s going to get worse for I would</text>
  <text start="233.67" dur="3.9">say almost everyone for those people who</text>
  <text start="236.1" dur="5.76">have been feeling it for a very long</text>
  <text start="237.57" dur="6.33">time it&amp;#39;s gonna feel unbelievably bad to</text>
  <text start="241.86" dur="3.63">them for those people who have never</text>
  <text start="243.9" dur="4.89">felt anything has been studying their</text>
  <text start="245.49" dur="5.219">jobs they feel secure they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="248.79" dur="6.59">be shocked of what it&amp;#39;s about to happen</text>
  <text start="250.709" dur="9.481">and we can see that the central banks</text>
  <text start="255.38" dur="7.72">they have nothing left think about the</text>
  <text start="260.19" dur="7.2">economy right now where it is the</text>
  <text start="263.1" dur="6.15">economy is full-blown quantitative</text>
  <text start="267.39" dur="4.32">easing they&amp;#39;ve never stopped it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="269.25" dur="3.66">continually monetizing everything to</text>
  <text start="271.71" dur="3.24">keep everything afloat they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="272.91" dur="4.29">manipulating the stock market to keep it</text>
  <text start="274.95" dur="3.719">up they&amp;#39;re manipulating unemployment to</text>
  <text start="277.2" dur="4.469">convince you that it&amp;#39;s fine they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="278.669" dur="4.731">suppressing gold and silver so no one</text>
  <text start="281.669" dur="4.321">understands what&amp;#39;s really going on here</text>
  <text start="283.4" dur="4.99">they&amp;#39;ve brought interest rates down to</text>
  <text start="285.99" dur="5.76">zero and in many countries they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="288.39" dur="4.92">negative territory and what we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="291.75" dur="3.51">to see most likely here in the United</text>
  <text start="293.31" dur="3.96">States the Fed will go to negative</text>
  <text start="295.26" dur="2.4">interest rates and eventually what will</text>
  <text start="297.27" dur="2.45">happen</text>
  <text start="297.66" dur="4.77">is they will go to the depositors and</text>
  <text start="299.72" dur="5.05">they will start taking funds from the</text>
  <text start="302.43" dur="5.97">people before the balance and we are</text>
  <text start="304.77" dur="6.15">starting to see this I know the ECB back</text>
  <text start="308.4" dur="5.28">in june fifth of 2014 they announced</text>
  <text start="310.92" dur="6.78">that the rate on deposits are going to</text>
  <text start="313.68" dur="7.68">go negative eventually and after what a</text>
  <text start="317.7" dur="7.47">year or so or two years of waiting guess</text>
  <text start="321.36" dur="6.21">what they&amp;#39;re starting to do it we see</text>
  <text start="325.17" dur="3.98">right now that the german cooperative</text>
  <text start="327.57" dur="3.75">savings bank in bavarian village</text>
  <text start="329.15" dur="5.07">announced it&amp;#39;s going to start charging</text>
  <text start="331.32" dur="6.54">retail customers to hold their cash</text>
  <text start="334.22" dur="7.48">starting September for savings in excess</text>
  <text start="337.86" dur="6.21">of a hundred euros the communities hi</text>
  <text start="341.7" dur="5.01">facin bank will charge point four</text>
  <text start="344.07" dur="6.48">percent rate they are going to take the</text>
  <text start="346.71" dur="5.66">funds out of their accounts and we know</text>
  <text start="350.55" dur="3.93">they always start at the high level</text>
  <text start="352.37" dur="4.48">where they say no it&amp;#39;s not going to be</text>
  <text start="354.48" dur="3.96">the depositors it&amp;#39;s going to be you know</text>
  <text start="356.85" dur="3.36">everything else and then it moves down</text>
  <text start="358.44" dur="3.63">to those people who have a hundred</text>
  <text start="360.21" dur="4.74">thousand than those people that have</text>
  <text start="362.07" dur="4.38">50,000 then those people have 20,000 and</text>
  <text start="364.95" dur="3.18">then before you know it it is every</text>
  <text start="366.45" dur="5.67">single person they do this every single</text>
  <text start="368.13" dur="6.18">time and it has already begun now we see</text>
  <text start="372.12" dur="4.67">the United States is out there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="374.31" dur="6.32">declining a public health emergency it</text>
  <text start="376.79" dur="8.32">has been declared for Puerto Rico and</text>
  <text start="380.63" dur="7.24">this is for the Zika virus outbreak now</text>
  <text start="385.11" dur="6.53">once again they are using this it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="387.87" dur="6.59">propaganda stunt we can see right now</text>
  <text start="391.64" dur="5.86">most likely they&amp;#39;re going to have this</text>
  <text start="394.46" dur="5.17">continued on through the elections now</text>
  <text start="397.5" dur="4.83">we know we have a perfect storm</text>
  <text start="399.63" dur="5.94">occurring we have the elections coming</text>
  <text start="402.33" dur="5.7">up this fall war is brewing all across</text>
  <text start="405.57" dur="6.81">the world the economy is deteriorating</text>
  <text start="408.03" dur="6.42">and we know most likely they want to</text>
  <text start="412.38" dur="4.95">postpone these elections if it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="414.45" dur="5.76">going their way we also know part of the</text>
  <text start="417.33" dur="5.46">agenda for Zika is to get everyone</text>
  <text start="420.21" dur="4.98">vaccinated because the corporation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="422.79" dur="5.55">make money this way and who knows what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="425.19" dur="6.18">in this latest vaccine out in South</text>
  <text start="428.34" dur="5.7">Sudan we see the</text>
  <text start="431.37" dur="4.2">us and the UN they need to take control</text>
  <text start="434.04" dur="4.08">of this area and you have to remember if</text>
  <text start="435.57" dur="5.01">we go back to what General Wesley Clark</text>
  <text start="438.12" dur="4.019">said that we&amp;#39;re gonna begin we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="440.58" dur="5.52">to be going into all of these different</text>
  <text start="442.139" dur="9.901">countries starting with Sudan Somalia</text>
  <text start="446.1" dur="8.31">Libya Yemen Lebanon Iraq Syria and</text>
  <text start="452.04" dur="4.77">eventually Iran but what we can see in</text>
  <text start="454.41" dur="5.16">his work we&amp;#39;ve been tracking is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="456.81" dur="6.71">losing control in all of these areas and</text>
  <text start="459.57" dur="6.629">we see South Sudan they will not accept</text>
  <text start="463.52" dur="5.04">the 4,000 member United Nations</text>
  <text start="466.199" dur="6.321">Protection Force which really means</text>
  <text start="468.56" dur="6.82">military soldiers garrison their country</text>
  <text start="472.52" dur="6.03">because the United Nations they want to</text>
  <text start="475.38" dur="5.55">bring these soldiers in to ensure peace</text>
  <text start="478.55" dur="7.089">well we know this is not what it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="480.93" dur="7.65">it&amp;#39;s to take control and we can see</text>
  <text start="485.639" dur="4.861">right now the South Sudan government has</text>
  <text start="488.58" dur="5.309">said that it&amp;#39;s very unfortunate and</text>
  <text start="490.5" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re not going to cooperate because we</text>
  <text start="493.889" dur="4.561">will not allow our country to be taken</text>
  <text start="495.72" dur="5.1">over by the UN and that&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="498.45" dur="5.25">is happening now out in the South China</text>
  <text start="500.82" dur="5.55">Sea we understand the United States and</text>
  <text start="503.7" dur="4.68">all the other nations around that area</text>
  <text start="506.37" dur="4.29">being pushed by the United States</text>
  <text start="508.38" dur="5.159">they&amp;#39;re trying to provoke China China</text>
  <text start="510.66" dur="4.77">realizes this and China and Russia they</text>
  <text start="513.539" dur="3.63">understand what the United States the</text>
  <text start="515.43" dur="3.72">central bankers are trying to do they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="517.169" dur="3.841">trying to provoke war and we can see</text>
  <text start="519.15" dur="3.93">that Russia and China they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="521.01" dur="3.9">building up their military during this</text>
  <text start="523.08" dur="3.72">period of time and so has the United</text>
  <text start="524.91" dur="4.2">States actually the United States NATO</text>
  <text start="526.8" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;ve been provoking these nations to</text>
  <text start="529.11" dur="3.78">build up the military because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="530.88" dur="3.75">the ones who first started to bring in</text>
  <text start="532.89" dur="5.34">the aircraft carriers to the South</text>
  <text start="534.63" dur="6.81">Pacific to set up the missile shield and</text>
  <text start="538.23" dur="5.79">circling China setting up the troops the</text>
  <text start="541.44" dur="3.96">missile shield in Eastern Europe and we</text>
  <text start="544.02" dur="3.33">can see that these countries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="545.4" dur="4.59">getting prepared because where are we</text>
  <text start="547.35" dur="5.46">headed we are headed towards war so</text>
  <text start="549.99" dur="7.26">China they have launched their 11th</text>
  <text start="552.81" dur="7.56">carrier killer destroyer this is the</text>
  <text start="557.25" dur="6.66">11th type 05 to class elite guided</text>
  <text start="560.37" dur="6.69">missile destroyer it is joined the fleet</text>
  <text start="563.91" dur="5.64">it has and it&amp;#39;s quipped with the YJ 18</text>
  <text start="567.06" dur="6.78">long-range supersonic anti-ship missile</text>
  <text start="569.55" dur="8.33">and this is the system that will knock</text>
  <text start="573.84" dur="7.56">out and destroy an aircraft carrier and</text>
  <text start="577.88" dur="6.64">it is very very difficult to stop these</text>
  <text start="581.4" dur="6.48">type of missiles because they move they</text>
  <text start="584.52" dur="5.01">Bob they weave and it&amp;#39;s very difficult</text>
  <text start="587.88" dur="3.57">for the u.s. to stop this and this is</text>
  <text start="589.53" dur="4.26">why people are saying right now that</text>
  <text start="591.45" dur="4.77">aircraft carrier is a kind of obsolete</text>
  <text start="593.79" dur="6.33">because Russia has these type of systems</text>
  <text start="596.22" dur="6.06">China has these type of systems and what</text>
  <text start="600.12" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;re seeing is a huge build of Japan</text>
  <text start="602.28" dur="5.61">right now the government there has</text>
  <text start="604.92" dur="6.66">decided to plan to develop a land to see</text>
  <text start="607.89" dur="8.46">missile with a range of 186 miles so it</text>
  <text start="611.58" dur="8.25">can hit those targets in China we see</text>
  <text start="616.35" dur="5.31">out in Ukraine Ukrainian media is</text>
  <text start="619.83" dur="5.67">calling for repression in the south of</text>
  <text start="621.66" dur="7.47">Ukraine and a fight for Crimea by all</text>
  <text start="625.5" dur="7.08">means this whole thing is really</text>
  <text start="629.13" dur="5.13">starting to heat up Russia is deploying</text>
  <text start="632.58" dur="4.02">their coastal defense missile system</text>
  <text start="634.26" dur="4.44">near the border with the Baltic States</text>
  <text start="636.6" dur="4.76">they&amp;#39;ve already placed this on Crimea</text>
  <text start="638.7" dur="5.16">and the bastion p is a mobile</text>

  <text start="645.63" dur="7.13">p800 anti-ship missiles and they are in</text>
  <text start="649.11" dur="7.4">place right now so we are seeing this in</text>
  <text start="652.76" dur="5.95">all different areas China Russia</text>
  <text start="656.51" dur="4.45">building up their defenses because they</text>
  <text start="658.71" dur="3.54">realize what&amp;#39;s about to happen here they</text>
  <text start="660.96" dur="2.85">realized that the United States</text>

  <text start="677.73" dur="3.6">not because these areas attack the</text>
  <text start="679.59" dur="3.15">United States it&amp;#39;s because the United</text>
