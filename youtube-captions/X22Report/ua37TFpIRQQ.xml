  <text start="137.08" dur="5.76">out now leading up to that fact I mean</text>
  <text start="140.739" dur="4.261">if we look at the eurozone right now the</text>
  <text start="142.84" dur="6.119">eurozone economy appears to be slowing</text>
  <text start="145" dur="6.03">down and as it entered as it enters its</text>

  <text start="160.269" dur="4.801">it looks like and they&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="163.36" dur="5.46">Purchasing Managers Index for the</text>
  <text start="165.07" dur="6.9">eurozone based on the survey of 5000</text>
  <text start="168.82" dur="4.71">manufacturers and service providers it</text>
  <text start="171.97" dur="7.56">looks like these numbers have fallen</text>
  <text start="173.53" dur="7.56">from 56.7 to 55.9 in October and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="179.53" dur="4.32">saying that as we move throughout this</text>
  <text start="181.09" dur="5.07">year we&amp;#39;re going to see this decline</text>
  <text start="183.85" dur="3.42">even further and actually a decline that</text>
  <text start="186.16" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="187.27" dur="5.4">again unexpected and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="190.63" dur="5.19">is not just here in the United States</text>
  <text start="192.67" dur="4.89">but out in Europe in Canada Australia I</text>
  <text start="195.82" dur="5.07">mean we know that Cirrus is pretty much</text>
  <text start="197.56" dur="6.75">closed up shop in in in Canada we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="200.89" dur="6.9">starting to see the real economy rear</text>
  <text start="204.31" dur="5.91">its ugly head and there&amp;#39;s nothing that</text>
  <text start="207.79" dur="3.75">the corporate media or the Fed or the US</text>
  <text start="210.22" dur="2.61">government can do yes they can</text>
  <text start="211.54" dur="3.63">manipulate the numbers they can tell us</text>
  <text start="212.83" dur="4.23">that GDP was 3.0 they can tell us that</text>
  <text start="215.17" dur="3.39">the stock market is doing well all I</text>
  <text start="217.06" dur="3.45">have to do is point to it and say hey</text>
  <text start="218.56" dur="3.48">look the stock market&amp;#39;s doing well they</text>
  <text start="220.51" dur="3.51">could tell you that retail is doing well</text>
  <text start="222.04" dur="4.68">and everything&amp;#39;s moving to online but we</text>
  <text start="224.02" dur="4.77">know that this isn&amp;#39;t true</text>
  <text start="226.72" dur="4.98">now when we look at the economy here in</text>
  <text start="228.79" dur="5.22">the United States we see incomes are</text>
  <text start="231.7" dur="4.44">declining continue I mean it hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="234.01" dur="4.77">stopped and we see right now that the</text>
  <text start="236.14" dur="6.24">u.s. savings rate has crashed to a</text>
  <text start="238.78" dur="5.88">ten-year low now think about why this is</text>
  <text start="242.38" dur="5.01">happening first of all a lot of people</text>
  <text start="244.66" dur="5.07">have maxed out their credit cards a lot</text>
  <text start="247.39" dur="4.29">of people have lost their jobs wages are</text>
  <text start="249.73" dur="4.17">declining they&amp;#39;re taking part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="251.68" dur="5.1">or they&amp;#39;re living off whatever they have</text>
  <text start="253.9" dur="5.61">left in their savings and people have to</text>
  <text start="256.78" dur="5.55">use this to survive and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="259.51" dur="7.41">seeing right now is that the savings</text>
  <text start="262.33" dur="9.69">rate is declining quicker and quicker</text>
  <text start="266.92" dur="7.53">and quicker now the last time that we</text>
  <text start="272.02" dur="4.56">saw people spend like this where people</text>
  <text start="274.45" dur="6.17">went out and said okay I need to get the</text>
  <text start="276.58" dur="5.85">stuff that I need was in August of 2009</text>
  <text start="280.62" dur="3.52">where people took it out of their</text>
  <text start="282.43" dur="3.66">savings they went out and said okay I</text>
  <text start="284.14" dur="3.93">can&amp;#39;t wait any longer I have no room</text>
  <text start="286.09" dur="5.1">left on my credit cards I&amp;#39;m gonna have</text>
  <text start="288.07" dur="5.55">to dip into my savings and go for it now</text>
  <text start="291.19" dur="4.97">remember back in August of 2009 the</text>
  <text start="293.62" dur="5.61">government unleashed cash for clunkers</text>
  <text start="296.16" dur="4.33">now spending surged during that period</text>
  <text start="299.23" dur="4.08">of time people went into their savings</text>
  <text start="300.49" dur="4.8">and they used their money and the</text>
  <text start="303.31" dur="5.28">following month well guess what</text>
  <text start="305.29" dur="5.49">spending plummeted right after that so</text>
  <text start="308.59" dur="4.77">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="310.78" dur="5.97">people they are doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="313.36" dur="6.27">possibly can to survive and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="316.75" dur="3.96">dipping into their savings now think</text>
  <text start="319.63" dur="4.95">about this for</text>
  <text start="320.71" dur="6.57">another piece of information here homes</text>
  <text start="324.58" dur="5.64">in the United States well they have</text>
  <text start="327.28" dur="5.759">finally surpassed their prior all-time</text>
  <text start="330.22" dur="6.27">highs remember that bubble that we had</text>
  <text start="333.039" dur="5.791">back in 2006 2007 2008 in a popped well</text>
  <text start="336.49" dur="4.649">we finally reached a point where we are</text>
  <text start="338.83" dur="4.02">higher than that now we broke it down in</text>
  <text start="341.139" dur="4.111">other reports in different cities</text>
  <text start="342.85" dur="6.24">showing that yes we are way above those</text>
  <text start="345.25" dur="5.97">areas but overall if we look at Case</text>
  <text start="349.09" dur="5.13">Shiller we see that we are now above</text>
  <text start="351.22" dur="5.1">that area now what we&amp;#39;re looking at here</text>
  <text start="354.22" dur="4.229">is that people can&amp;#39;t really afford these</text>
  <text start="356.32" dur="3.54">homes they&amp;#39;re just way too expensive</text>
  <text start="358.449" dur="2.94">they don&amp;#39;t have the downpayment they</text>
  <text start="359.86" dur="3.989">don&amp;#39;t have the cash to put the</text>
  <text start="361.389" dur="5.191">downpayment on and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="363.849" dur="5.75">cash investors the hedge funds the</text>
  <text start="366.58" dur="6.809">investment companies they are all</text>
  <text start="369.599" dur="6.011">backing out now and when we look at this</text>
  <text start="373.389" dur="4.441">there&amp;#39;s a problem that while housing</text>
  <text start="375.61" dur="5.7">prices are once again hitting all-time</text>
  <text start="377.83" dur="5.91">highs every month household incomes have</text>
  <text start="381.31" dur="5.039">failed to keep up in fact the blog the</text>
  <text start="383.74" dur="5.25">political calculations shows in the past</text>
  <text start="386.349" dur="5.19">two years there has been a distinct</text>
  <text start="388.99" dur="6.63">trend in home affordability or lack</text>
  <text start="391.539" dur="6.75">thereof now that when you hear this you</text>
  <text start="395.62" dur="5.31">say well who&amp;#39;s buying these homes well</text>
  <text start="398.289" dur="4.141">we know it&amp;#39;s the Chinese and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="400.93" dur="3.93">backing out they&amp;#39;re investing now in</text>
  <text start="402.43" dur="4.709">Belton Road we know as hedge funds</text>
  <text start="404.86" dur="4.89">investment companies and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="407.139" dur="5.731">happening right now is that things are</text>
  <text start="409.75" dur="4.53">rapidly falling apart because the</text>
  <text start="412.87" dur="3.269">everyday American has been sitting on</text>
  <text start="414.28" dur="3.9">the sidelines because when you look at</text>
  <text start="416.139" dur="5.101">the overall affordability the ratio of</text>
  <text start="418.18" dur="5.88">the trailing 12-month averages a median</text>
  <text start="421.24" dur="4.799">new home sale prices to medium household</text>
  <text start="424.06" dur="4.32">income in the US has risen to an</text>
  <text start="426.039" dur="6.421">all-time high of five point four five</text>
  <text start="428.38" dur="7.2">four in other words the median new home</text>
  <text start="432.46" dur="6.03">in the US has never been more affordable</text>
  <text start="435.58" dur="5.55">in terms of current income that means</text>
  <text start="438.49" dur="5.58">people are not making enough and the</text>
  <text start="441.13" dur="5.969">housing prices are skyrocketing this is</text>
  <text start="444.07" dur="5.159">a complete and utter disaster and you</text>
  <text start="447.099" dur="3.601">know what happens when we see this I</text>
  <text start="449.229" dur="2.701">mean think about it when did we see this</text>
  <text start="450.7" dur="3.66">before oh that&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="451.93" dur="4.32">the last housing bubble were</text>
  <text start="454.36" dur="5.22">repeating everything that we&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="456.25" dur="6.36">seen except there&amp;#39;s one problem it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="459.58" dur="5.07">much worse now all those people that</text>
  <text start="462.61" dur="4.649">weren&amp;#39;t affected the last time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="464.65" dur="4.53">going to be affected this time and all</text>
  <text start="467.259" dur="3.291">those people who are underwater back</text>
  <text start="469.18" dur="5.009">then and still held on to their homes</text>
  <text start="470.55" dur="5.2">they might be affected once again those</text>
  <text start="474.189" dur="4.29">people who have lost their high-paying</text>
  <text start="475.75" dur="3.9">jobs who can&amp;#39;t find a job well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="478.479" dur="4.951">not going to be as effective because</text>
  <text start="479.65" dur="6.6">they have learned how to adjust to not</text>
  <text start="483.43" dur="4.829">having or going out and purchasing those</text>
  <text start="486.25" dur="3.029">people who might still have their jobs</text>
  <text start="488.259" dur="3.601">and maybe they&amp;#39;re not getting the</text>
  <text start="489.279" dur="5.16">cost-of-living raise they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="491.86" dur="4.44">in for a big shock now I don&amp;#39;t wish this</text>
  <text start="494.439" dur="4.081">on anyone this is a terrible thing to</text>
  <text start="496.3" dur="3.899">happen but we can see that we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="498.52" dur="3.119">in this direction this is why we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="500.199" dur="3.75">saying even though you have a job where</text>
  <text start="501.639" dur="4.291">we have a part-time job uni or no job</text>
  <text start="503.949" dur="3.451">you need to you know put away whatever</text>
  <text start="505.93" dur="3.81">you possibly can if it has to do with</text>
  <text start="507.4" dur="4.5">food maybe it&amp;#39;s not cash if you have the</text>
  <text start="509.74" dur="4.169">cash put away cash if you have the cash</text>
  <text start="511.9" dur="4.199">buy some gold and put away the cash I</text>
  <text start="513.909" dur="4.231">mean there&amp;#39;s different levels but you</text>
  <text start="516.099" dur="5.011">can get prepared and if it&amp;#39;s only food</text>
  <text start="518.14" dur="3.559">water supplies medical supplies that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="521.11" dur="3.719">it</text>
  <text start="521.699" dur="7.091">now we can see that the Wall Street</text>
  <text start="524.829" dur="6.811">banks they are in trouble the volume of</text>
  <text start="528.79" dur="6.18">leveraged loans the riskiest loans Wall</text>
  <text start="531.64" dur="5.34">Street banks provide has surged to 38</text>
  <text start="534.97" dur="4.44">percent year-over-year and has already</text>
  <text start="536.98" dur="5.51">beaten the full-year record set in 2013</text>
  <text start="539.41" dur="6.239">now this is according to deal logic and</text>
  <text start="542.49" dur="4.3">total of leveraged loans outstanding has</text>
  <text start="545.649" dur="5.341">reached about one point two five</text>
  <text start="546.79" dur="6.21">trillion nine of the ten largest banks</text>
  <text start="550.99" dur="6.209">in the leveraged loan business have</text>
  <text start="553" dur="9.329">already surpassed their 2016 full-year</text>
  <text start="557.199" dur="6.601">totals now this is including Bank of</text>
  <text start="562.329" dur="2.94">America about a hundred and twenty</text>
  <text start="563.8" dur="4.86">billion in leveraged loans so far this</text>

  <text start="574.75" dur="6.39">at 69 billion is still lagging behind</text>
  <text start="577.48" dur="5.729">list this year now we could see that</text>
  <text start="581.14" dur="5.97">this is going to be a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="583.209" dur="4.911">disaster now what are these banks do</text>
  <text start="587.11" dur="3.32">with these</text>
  <text start="588.12" dur="4.86">risky loans and things like that well</text>
  <text start="590.43" dur="4.769">they package them up and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="592.98" dur="4.56">packaging them up I mean they&amp;#39;re at a</text>
  <text start="595.199" dur="5.88">record-breaking 8.3 billion so far this</text>
  <text start="597.54" dur="4.44">year just 6% below the full-year total</text>
  <text start="601.079" dur="3.44">of 2016</text>
  <text start="601.98" dur="5.219">now the borrower&amp;#39;s are junk rated</text>
  <text start="604.519" dur="4.54">over-indebted companies leveraged loans</text>
  <text start="607.199" dur="4.05">are too risky for banks to keep on their</text>
  <text start="609.059" dur="4.53">balance sheet so banks structure these</text>
  <text start="611.249" dur="5.041">loans arrange them and sell the</text>
  <text start="613.589" dur="6.3">structured products to loan mutual funds</text>
  <text start="616.29" dur="6.12">or ETFs so they can be moved into yes</text>

  <text start="633.329" dur="5.82">know that their their whole entire model</text>
  <text start="637.47" dur="3.989">is based around an interest rate of</text>
  <text start="639.149" dur="4.201">either six seven or eight percent and</text>
  <text start="641.459" dur="4.891">they haven&amp;#39;t been receiving that now</text>

  <text start="659.37" dur="5.43">everything just completely falls apart</text>
  <text start="660.99" dur="5.939">and this is what we&amp;#39;re going to see now</text>
  <text start="664.8" dur="3.959">the corporate media they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="666.929" dur="4.35">building up to this now remember back</text>
  <text start="668.759" dur="4.56">during the recovery with Obama when they</text>
  <text start="671.279" dur="4.8">said oh my god 2.2 percent GDP it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="673.319" dur="5.46">incredible we&amp;#39;re recovering oh my god we</text>
  <text start="676.079" dur="4.98">hit two point three percent GDP we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="678.779" dur="4.141">recovering this is what a recovery looks</text>
  <text start="681.059" dur="4.65">like now it&amp;#39;s very interesting we know</text>
  <text start="682.92" dur="4.139">that the government under Trump and the</text>
  <text start="685.709" dur="3.06">Federal Reserve they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="687.059" dur="4.53">manipulating all the data nothing has</text>
  <text start="688.769" dur="5.281">really changed now they came out with</text>
  <text start="691.589" dur="4.381">this new GDP number and they said the US</text>
  <text start="694.05" dur="3.659">economy grow at a rate three percent and</text>
  <text start="695.97" dur="4.5">third quarter this came from the</text>
  <text start="697.709" dur="5.521">Commerce Department now let&amp;#39;s think</text>
  <text start="700.47" dur="4.77">about this we hit 3% and we&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="703.23" dur="3.87">been around 2% and that&amp;#39;s manipulated we</text>
  <text start="705.24" dur="3.329">know 3% is manipulated but all of a</text>
  <text start="707.1" dur="2.94">sudden we hit 3% now the corporate media</text>
  <text start="708.569" dur="2.911">is out there you think they&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="710.04" dur="4.019">clapping their hands going oh my god we</text>
  <text start="711.48" dur="5.01">finally hit 3% because we haven&amp;#39;t done</text>
  <text start="714.059" dur="5.691">this all throughout Obama&amp;#39;s recovery we</text>
  <text start="716.49" dur="5.52">finally hit it incredible instead</text>
  <text start="719.75" dur="8.14">they&amp;#39;re saying that the US</text>
  <text start="722.01" dur="8.64">me isn&amp;#39;t quite as strong as it looks now</text>
  <text start="727.89" dur="4.65">let&amp;#39;s think about this for a second why</text>
  <text start="730.65" dur="3.45">would they all of a sudden say this</text>
  <text start="732.54" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re saying that the gross domestic</text>
  <text start="734.1" dur="5.52">product the measure used to represent</text>
  <text start="736.23" dur="5.7">the US economy expanded by three percent</text>
  <text start="739.62" dur="4.65">in the third quarter that&amp;#39;s the second</text>
  <text start="741.93" dur="5.01">straight quarter of growth above 2% pace</text>
  <text start="744.27" dur="4.77">that has persisted for much of the</text>
  <text start="746.94" dur="5.16">economic recovery and it&amp;#39;s well above</text>
  <text start="749.04" dur="5.7">the expectations of 2.6 percent but</text>
  <text start="752.1" dur="4.38">there are a few important details they</text>
  <text start="754.74" dur="2.97">say in the numbers that the economists</text>
  <text start="756.48" dur="3.81">including those at the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="757.71" dur="4.98">will look at now they start bringing up</text>
  <text start="760.29" dur="5.4">things like the things that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="762.69" dur="5.16">talking about which is kind of odd they</text>
  <text start="765.69" dur="4.41">said one thing driving the number higher</text>
  <text start="767.85" dur="4.86">was a rise in business inventories that</text>
  <text start="770.1" dur="5.79">could mean businesses are stocking up in</text>
  <text start="772.71" dur="5.19">anticipation of growth in demand or it</text>
  <text start="775.89" dur="4.74">could mean that there have there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="777.9" dur="6.24">ready for harder times that are moving</text>
  <text start="780.63" dur="6.32">in at the same time investments in</text>
  <text start="784.14" dur="4.89">structures slumped by 5.2 percent and</text>
  <text start="786.95" dur="4.78">residential investments slipped by 6</text>
  <text start="789.03" dur="4.95">percent also worrisome personal</text>
  <text start="791.73" dur="5.22">disposable income rose just by 0.6</text>
  <text start="793.98" dur="5.01">percent adjusted for inflation they said</text>
  <text start="796.95" dur="4.86">another worrisome sign especially from</text>
  <text start="798.99" dur="4.86">the feds perspective inflation as</text>
  <text start="801.81" dur="4.86">measured by the personal consumption</text>
  <text start="803.85" dur="4.71">expenditure index registered at 1.5</text>
  <text start="806.67" dur="3.75">percent in the third quarter and just</text>
  <text start="808.56" dur="3.69">one point three percent excluding food</text>
  <text start="810.42" dur="3.69">and energy now they&amp;#39;re starting to bring</text>
  <text start="812.25" dur="3.24">up all these different signs that we</text>
  <text start="814.11" dur="4.83">should be looking at and we should be</text>
  <text start="815.49" dur="6.93">worried about and they continued on with</text>
  <text start="818.94" dur="5.46">well maybe they&amp;#39;re the jobs that are out</text>
  <text start="822.42" dur="4.32">there they&amp;#39;re not as strong as we</text>
  <text start="824.4" dur="3.69">thought maybe the manufacturing is not</text>
  <text start="826.74" dur="3.27">really producing the way it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="828.09" dur="3.27">producing and they&amp;#39;re starting to bring</text>
  <text start="830.01" dur="2.55">up all these different things that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="831.36" dur="4.41">been talking about for a very long time</text>
  <text start="832.56" dur="5.82">but now they&amp;#39;re discussing it openly</text>
  <text start="835.77" dur="5.49">with everyone saying maybe we should</text>
  <text start="838.38" dur="6.21">have some type of concern that these</text>
  <text start="841.26" dur="6.3">numbers aren&amp;#39;t true and this tells us</text>
  <text start="844.59" dur="4.95">something this tells us that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="847.56" dur="4.95">trying to cover themselves they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="849.54" dur="5.28">preparing and getting ready to say the</text>
  <text start="852.51" dur="3.15">economy really isn&amp;#39;t doing that well</text>
  <text start="854.82" dur="3.78">these</text>
  <text start="855.66" dur="5.61">numbers are completely fake and they</text>
  <text start="858.6" dur="4.08">might be leading into this fact or they</text>
  <text start="861.27" dur="3.12">might just be saying and building this</text>
  <text start="862.68" dur="3.75">up so they when the economy comes down</text>
  <text start="864.39" dur="5.28">and we know the Fed will bring it down</text>
  <text start="866.43" dur="4.65">that they can just blame this on Trump I</text>
  <text start="869.67" dur="3.9">mean that&amp;#39;s really what they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="871.08" dur="4.23">going to do and they&amp;#39;re already building</text>
  <text start="873.57" dur="4.77">this up because already we see out in</text>
  <text start="875.31" dur="6.12">Yahoo where they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="878.34" dur="4.65">market might be overvalued and maybe</text>
  <text start="881.43" dur="3.96">it&amp;#39;s not going to go up any further and</text>
  <text start="882.99" dur="4.89">maybe we&amp;#39;re getting prepared for some</text>
  <text start="885.39" dur="4.02">type of downturn we see this is coming</text>
  <text start="887.88" dur="3.84">out of Business Insider where the</text>
  <text start="889.41" dur="4.65">economy is not as strong as we all think</text>
  <text start="891.72" dur="3.36">it is and it&amp;#39;s amazing how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="894.06" dur="3.54">coming out with all this information</text>
  <text start="895.08" dur="3.99">right now because we know and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="897.6" dur="4.08">following it we&amp;#39;ve been following GDP</text>
  <text start="899.07" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;ve been discussing over this huge</text>
  <text start="901.68" dur="4.59">period of time how these GDP numbers are</text>
  <text start="904.11" dur="3.75">completely manipulated we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="906.27" dur="4.26">talking about unemployment manipulation</text>
  <text start="907.86" dur="4.17">not just here but everyone else that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="910.53" dur="3">been looking at these numbers have</text>
  <text start="912.03" dur="4.29">delved into them and saying you know</text>
  <text start="913.53" dur="5.13">yeah these aren&amp;#39;t really calculated</text>
  <text start="916.32" dur="5.46">correctly if we look at John from shadow</text>
  <text start="918.66" dur="5.19">stats he does the calculation without a</text>
  <text start="921.78" dur="3.63">little manipulation and shows that yeah</text>
  <text start="923.85" dur="3.93">unemployment is much much higher than</text>
  <text start="925.41" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re talking about GDP is much much</text>
  <text start="927.78" dur="5.58">lower than they&amp;#39;re talking about and</text>
  <text start="929.61" dur="5.97">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing that yeah the whole</text>
  <text start="933.36" dur="4.17">entire system is getting ready to</text>
  <text start="935.58" dur="3.63">implode and it looks like the corporate</text>
  <text start="937.53" dur="4.71">media is starting to build up on this</text>
  <text start="939.21" dur="4.8">starting to convince us that under Trump</text>
  <text start="942.24" dur="3.24">at this point that the economy is not</text>
  <text start="944.01" dur="2.46">going to continue and remember he hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="945.48" dur="3.54">really done anything he hasn&amp;#39;t brought</text>
  <text start="946.47" dur="5.13">mat manufacturing these this is the same</text>
  <text start="949.02" dur="5.07">manipulation this is the same economy</text>
  <text start="951.6" dur="4.32">that Obama handed off to him there is no</text>
  <text start="954.09" dur="5.49">difference whatsoever he did not make</text>
  <text start="955.92" dur="6.69">any changes at all there&amp;#39;s nothing that</text>
  <text start="959.58" dur="6.12">has been changed so we&amp;#39;re still running</text>
  <text start="962.61" dur="7.25">on autopilot and he&amp;#39;s done nothing now</text>
  <text start="965.7" dur="7.74">we talked about the petrol you won and</text>
  <text start="969.86" dur="4.93">we talked about the petro dollar and we</text>
  <text start="973.44" dur="3.48">know there&amp;#39;s a lot of countries out</text>
  <text start="974.79" dur="3.84">there that have been sanctioned where</text>
  <text start="976.92" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re turning towards the petrol you</text>
  <text start="978.63" dur="6.84">won and the petrol you want is on the</text>
  <text start="981.96" dur="5.31">verge of becoming a reserve currency now</text>
  <text start="985.47" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s already considered a reserve</text>
  <text start="987.27" dur="4.109">currency because as including its</text>
  <text start="989.16" dur="4.38">included in the SDR basket and we have</text>
  <text start="991.379" dur="4.5">to remember nothing lasts forever if we</text>
  <text start="993.54" dur="3.96">go back in time we can see that one</text>
  <text start="995.879" dur="3.69">there was one time that Portugal was the</text>
  <text start="997.5" dur="4.11">reserve currency Spain was it was the</text>
  <text start="999.569" dur="4.171">reserve currency France was the reserve</text>
  <text start="1001.61" dur="4.2">currency Britain right before the United</text>
  <text start="1003.74" dur="3.99">States was a reserve currency the US</text>
  <text start="1005.81" dur="3.779">isn&amp;#39;t currently the reserve currency and</text>
  <text start="1007.73" dur="4.14">now it looks like it&amp;#39;s going to move to</text>
  <text start="1009.589" dur="4.131">a different country and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1011.87" dur="4.259">following this for a very long time and</text>
  <text start="1013.72" dur="4.179">we can see there&amp;#39;s a lot of countries</text>
  <text start="1016.129" dur="4.051">now that have been sanctioned or don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1017.899" dur="5.641">want to deal in the US dollar they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1020.18" dur="3.93">using the petrol you want now is it</text>
  <text start="1023.54" dur="3.06">ready to go</text>
  <text start="1024.11" dur="5.76">primetime ready to go full steam ahead</text>
  <text start="1026.6" dur="6.209">well neither was the US dollar until</text>
  <text start="1029.87" dur="4.53">after the war but they&amp;#39;re preparing it</text>
  <text start="1032.809" dur="3.451">and getting it ready it&amp;#39;s not something</text>
  <text start="1034.4" dur="3.45">they started yesterday this has been in</text>
  <text start="1036.26" dur="4.74">the works for a very long time remember</text>
  <text start="1037.85" dur="5.43">the central banks they don&amp;#39;t care who</text>
  <text start="1041" dur="5.429">has the reserve it doesn&amp;#39;t matter as</text>
  <text start="1043.28" dur="6.389">long as they can control the creation of</text>
  <text start="1046.429" dur="5.311">the currency and yes there is a central</text>
  <text start="1049.669" dur="5.431">bank private western central bank in</text>
  <text start="1051.74" dur="5.28">China they&amp;#39;re integrated and they still</text>
  <text start="1055.1" dur="5.1">are there they&amp;#39;re still controlling it</text>
  <text start="1057.02" dur="5.58">and they know that they had to duplicate</text>
  <text start="1060.2" dur="4.589">everything that&amp;#39;s been going on and move</text>
  <text start="1062.6" dur="4.41">everything away from the US just like</text>
  <text start="1064.789" dur="4.38">they did prior to World War two because</text>
  <text start="1067.01" dur="3.45">they knew that eventually the US was</text>
  <text start="1069.169" dur="2.851">going to be the reserve currency they</text>
  <text start="1070.46" dur="3.329">always know what they&amp;#39;re doing in</text>
  <text start="1072.02" dur="4.56">advance they just don&amp;#39;t tell anyone they</text>
  <text start="1073.789" dur="4.201">do it very quietly very stealth and this</text>
  <text start="1076.58" dur="3.75">is what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing right now and</text>
  <text start="1077.99" dur="4.02">it looks like they&amp;#39;re preparing this now</text>
  <text start="1080.33" dur="4.02">does this mean this is going to happen</text>
  <text start="1082.01" dur="5.039">no we have a new player in town that&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="1088.28" dur="3.57">people would like to do without the</text>
  <text start="1090.5" dur="4.86">central banks but the central banks are</text>
  <text start="1091.85" dur="5.22">trying to stay in power so we can see at</text>
  <text start="1095.36" dur="4.199">this point that the economies are</text>
  <text start="1097.07" dur="4.38">completely falling apart the corporate</text>
