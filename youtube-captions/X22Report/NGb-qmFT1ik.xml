  <text start="81.06" dur="5.01">are certain financial pundants that are</text>
  <text start="82.979" dur="5.431">also taking notice now we saw this way</text>

  <text start="88.41" dur="4.41">housing market were calling out retail</text>
  <text start="90.57" dur="4.68">we were called now the yield curve we</text>
  <text start="92.82" dur="5.07">were calling out all the manipulation</text>
  <text start="95.25" dur="5.16">the manipulation of unemployment the</text>

  <text start="100.41" dur="4.56">pretty much everything and housing is</text>
  <text start="103.47" dur="3.57">very important because it leads into</text>
  <text start="104.97" dur="4.2">many different areas of the economy to</text>
  <text start="107.04" dur="4.77">many different sectors and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="109.17" dur="4.41">seeing right now is the housing bubble</text>
  <text start="111.81" dur="2.94">here in the United States it&amp;#39;s popping</text>
  <text start="113.58" dur="3.12">and it&amp;#39;s not just popping here in the</text>
  <text start="114.75" dur="5.819">United States it&amp;#39;s popping in Canada</text>
  <text start="116.7" dur="6.63">Australia Europe and right now Redfin</text>
  <text start="120.569" dur="5.461">the CEO of redfin is saying that the</text>
  <text start="123.33" dur="5.899">affordability crisis may have reached a</text>
  <text start="126.03" dur="8.22">breaking point in Portland San Jose and</text>
  <text start="129.229" dur="8.051">Seattle because of buyer fatigue Redfin</text>
  <text start="134.25" dur="5.73">notes June home prices rose 5.7 percent</text>
  <text start="137.28" dur="6.03">year-over-year smallest increase since</text>
  <text start="139.98" dur="5.93">September 2016 the key point is buyer</text>
  <text start="143.31" dur="5.73">fatigue now Redfin went on to say after</text>
  <text start="145.91" dur="6.07">75 straight months of price increases in</text>
  <text start="149.04" dur="5.43">these markets that far outpaced wage</text>
  <text start="151.98" dur="4.589">growth homebuyers are now becoming</text>
  <text start="154.47" dur="4.98">selective about which homes to buy and</text>
  <text start="156.569" dur="4.861">at what price the percentage of listings</text>
  <text start="159.45" dur="4.649">in these markets that sold within two</text>
  <text start="161.43" dur="4.83">weeks declined in June from 61 percent</text>
  <text start="164.099" dur="4.021">to 52 percent and the fraction of</text>
  <text start="166.26" dur="4.41">listings that drop their price increase</text>
  <text start="168.12" dur="4.26">from 31 percent to 33 percent we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="170.67" dur="4.11">similar signs of buyer fatigue in the</text>
  <text start="172.38" dur="6">past especially at this point in this</text>
  <text start="174.78" dur="5.91">season but in the case the lull has</text>
  <text start="178.38" dur="4.26">lasted a bit longer and affected more</text>
  <text start="180.69" dur="2.7">markets than in the recent then in</text>
  <text start="182.64" dur="3.3">recent past</text>
  <text start="183.39" dur="3.89">once again signs are adding up that the</text>
  <text start="185.94" dur="4.76">housing has</text>
  <text start="187.28" dur="5.85">peeked this cycle and we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="190.7" dur="4.259">before where all of a sudden prices</text>
  <text start="193.13" dur="4.59">start to come down sales start to drive</text>
  <text start="194.959" dur="4.681">dry up traffic starts to dry up we saw</text>
  <text start="197.72" dur="4.47">this prior to 2008 actually we saw it in</text>
  <text start="199.64" dur="3.36">2006 going into 2007 and then it just</text>
  <text start="202.19" dur="3.18">got worse</text>
  <text start="203" dur="4.05">even though the Fed was out there the</text>
  <text start="205.37" dur="4.53">mainstream media was out there telling</text>
  <text start="207.05" dur="5.189">us that real estate was fine it was not</text>
  <text start="209.9" dur="3.87">now we need to remember that interest</text>
  <text start="212.239" dur="3.33">rates are starting to rise people are</text>
  <text start="213.77" dur="4.65">losing their jobs people coming out of</text>
  <text start="215.569" dur="5.971">colleges can&amp;#39;t find work and they have a</text>
  <text start="218.42" dur="5.16">lot of debt and this is a central</text>
  <text start="221.54" dur="5.37">banking economy we hate we say there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="223.58" dur="5.73">time and time again you cannot win</text>
  <text start="226.91" dur="5.1">against a central bank economy because</text>
  <text start="229.31" dur="4.89">the central bank economy is designed to</text>
  <text start="232.01" dur="4.259">collapse it&amp;#39;s designed to take the</text>
  <text start="234.2" dur="4.89">wealth away from the people and you see</text>
  <text start="236.269" dur="4.561">this at the very end stages yes you can</text>
  <text start="239.09" dur="4.05">see it in the middle stages but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.83" dur="4.379">really evident at the end stages and</text>
  <text start="243.14" dur="5.04">this is why they need some type an event</text>
  <text start="245.209" dur="5.581">or something to happen to cover up them</text>
  <text start="248.18" dur="5.66">moving this entire system into something</text>
  <text start="250.79" dur="6.629">completely different now you see this in</text>
  <text start="253.84" dur="5.44">jobs you see it in retail you see it in</text>
  <text start="257.419" dur="5.071">the purchasing of homes the purchasing</text>
  <text start="259.28" dur="4.74">of cars once they are finished with all</text>
  <text start="262.49" dur="4.35">their tricks and bringing in the</text>
  <text start="264.02" dur="4.649">subprime people giving no down payments</text>
  <text start="266.84" dur="3.3">and things like that they really have no</text>
  <text start="268.669" dur="2.731">ammunition left and I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="270.14" dur="4.44">the central bankers the bankers</text>
  <text start="271.4" dur="5.61">themselves to get people in because once</text>
  <text start="274.58" dur="4.08">you have too much debt you just have too</text>
  <text start="277.01" dur="3.69">much debt you can&amp;#39;t afford anything else</text>
  <text start="278.66" dur="4.35">now colleges are doing something very</text>
  <text start="280.7" dur="3.99">very interesting now we know there is</text>
  <text start="283.01" dur="3.36">the student loan market has reached</text>
  <text start="284.69" dur="3.63">all-time highs like we&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="286.37" dur="3.93">before and most of the individuals</text>
  <text start="288.32" dur="3.21">coming out of colleges they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="290.3" dur="3.33">very difficult time finding those</text>
  <text start="291.53" dur="3.81">high-paying jobs a lot of them can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="293.63" dur="3.72">even find jobs but they have this huge</text>
  <text start="295.34" dur="3.51">amount of debt and the government</text>
  <text start="297.35" dur="4.67">they&amp;#39;ve been working with these</text>
  <text start="298.85" dur="6.48">individuals and they adjusted their</text>
  <text start="302.02" dur="6.519">repayment of these loans by adjusting</text>
  <text start="305.33" dur="5.28">how they repay it now some of these</text>
  <text start="308.539" dur="5.311">deals are okay well base it off your</text>
  <text start="310.61" dur="5.94">income will calculate it out and your</text>
  <text start="313.85" dur="5.37">payments will be adjusted and you&amp;#39;ll you</text>
  <text start="316.55" dur="4.26">know spend 25 years paying this loan out</text>
  <text start="319.22" dur="3.33">well</text>
  <text start="320.81" dur="3.42">a lot of individuals are saying well if</text>
  <text start="322.55" dur="2.85">there&amp;#39;s no jobs out there I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="324.23" dur="2.7">to take out loans I don&amp;#39;t want to have</text>
  <text start="325.4" dur="3.21">this much debt and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="326.93" dur="3.48">saying what job am I gonna get with this</text>
  <text start="328.61" dur="3.54">college education if I&amp;#39;m just going and</text>
  <text start="330.41" dur="4.05">taking these classes where am I getting</text>
  <text start="332.15" dur="3.09">this job I&amp;#39;m really it doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="334.46" dur="3.87">sense for me</text>
  <text start="335.24" dur="5.82">so colleges are now offering an</text>
  <text start="338.33" dur="5.82">alternative to students who don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="341.06" dur="6.3">to be saddled with heavy student loans</text>
  <text start="344.15" dur="6.989">and for those who don&amp;#39;t qualify for</text>
  <text start="347.36" dur="5.97">student loans what colleges will allow</text>
  <text start="351.139" dur="5.881">you to do they will allow you to pay a</text>
  <text start="353.33" dur="7.53">percentage of your future salary over a</text>
  <text start="357.02" dur="5.85">set period of time to them now certain</text>
  <text start="360.86" dur="4.35">colleges are looking to do this not all</text>
  <text start="362.87" dur="5.25">of them as of yet but they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="365.21" dur="4.23">to realize that people can&amp;#39;t pay these</text>
  <text start="368.12" dur="3.84">student loans where they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="369.44" dur="4.35">have all this debt at the end of their</text>
  <text start="371.96" dur="2.1">college career now if you can&amp;#39;t find a</text>
  <text start="373.79" dur="2.79">job</text>
  <text start="374.06" dur="4.56">well they&amp;#39;ll defer it how long were they</text>
  <text start="376.58" dur="4.5">able to defer it who knows if you get a</text>
  <text start="378.62" dur="4.74">low paying job well your payments will</text>
  <text start="381.08" dur="6.209">be adjusted but the point of this is</text>
  <text start="383.36" dur="9.119">that you&amp;#39;re still enslaved to someone</text>
  <text start="387.289" dur="7.771">you still are paying someone for this</text>
  <text start="392.479" dur="5.25">education and hopefully you get a job</text>
  <text start="395.06" dur="5.25">that pays enough where you can pay this</text>
  <text start="397.729" dur="4.591">out which means your payments will be</text>
  <text start="400.31" dur="4.5">going to college and you&amp;#39;ll have less</text>
  <text start="402.32" dur="4.89">funds to pay for anything else</text>
  <text start="404.81" dur="5.4">now colleges are gonna just try to stay</text>
  <text start="407.21" dur="7.11">alive with all this but again this is</text>
  <text start="410.21" dur="7.05">still enslavement nothing&amp;#39;s changed here</text>
  <text start="414.32" dur="6.96">they just realized that people just end</text>
  <text start="417.26" dur="5.58">up with too much debt now we can&amp;#39;t fix</text>
  <text start="421.28" dur="3.389">this system the way it is it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="422.84" dur="4.77">going to get worse I mean think about it</text>
  <text start="424.669" dur="5.191">when the automobile industry first came</text>
  <text start="427.61" dur="4.02">out everyone paid cash she came out you</text>
  <text start="429.86" dur="4.26">bought your car it was whatever it was</text>
  <text start="431.63" dur="5.69">you know back going back in time 800</text>
  <text start="434.12" dur="7.41">1500 2000 I think in the 70s around</text>
  <text start="437.32" dur="6.49">$6,000 for a Pontiac Grand Prix many</text>
  <text start="441.53" dur="3.93">individuals they just paid cash then</text>
  <text start="443.81" dur="3.87">what happened is as the value of the</text>
  <text start="445.46" dur="3.93">dollar decreased people had to move into</text>
  <text start="447.68" dur="3.75">financing and it started out you know</text>
  <text start="449.39" dur="4.9">three years four years financing you own</text>
  <text start="451.43" dur="4.63">the car and then cars</text>
  <text start="454.29" dur="3.6">got very expensive which means the value</text>
  <text start="456.06" dur="4.86">of the dollar decreased and you had to</text>
  <text start="457.89" dur="6.09">take out a lease because you couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="460.92" dur="5.13">afford the financing and financing then</text>
  <text start="463.98" dur="5.25">went to you know 60 months than the 70</text>
  <text start="466.05" dur="5.12">months and people lease their cars which</text>
  <text start="469.23" dur="4.74">really meant they rented their cars and</text>
  <text start="471.17" dur="6.55">this is how it&amp;#39;s been and you can see</text>
  <text start="473.97" dur="8.22">over time how the value of the dollar as</text>
  <text start="477.72" dur="7.74">it loses its value how it affects your</text>
  <text start="482.19" dur="4.98">purchasing power on items and the same</text>
  <text start="485.46" dur="3.57">thing with colleges people used to work</text>
  <text start="487.17" dur="4.26">and pay for their colleges they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="489.03" dur="5.73">even do that anymore that means the</text>
  <text start="491.43" dur="6.51">system well it&amp;#39;s done for and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="494.76" dur="4.68">entering the end stages of this system</text>
  <text start="497.94" dur="4.56">and we&amp;#39;re going to be making a</text>
  <text start="499.44" dur="4.8">transition now we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking</text>
  <text start="502.5" dur="5.51">about this transition in a second and</text>
  <text start="504.24" dur="6.36">it&amp;#39;s not going to be easy for businesses</text>
  <text start="508.01" dur="4.75">people because when you&amp;#39;re breaking out</text>
  <text start="510.6" dur="3.569">of a central bank system it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="512.76" dur="3.659">difficult first of all the central bank</text>
  <text start="514.169" dur="3.81">doesn&amp;#39;t want to lose control secondly</text>
  <text start="516.419" dur="4.141">you have to restart everything and</text>
  <text start="517.979" dur="4.081">people don&amp;#39;t understand this and to</text>
  <text start="520.56" dur="4.17">restart everything you have to start</text>
  <text start="522.06" dur="5.49">changing things and changing it out of a</text>
  <text start="524.73" dur="4.95">central banking system well it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="527.55" dur="4.05">to be very very rough now before we get</text>
  <text start="529.68" dur="4.77">into the transition and what that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="531.6" dur="5.16">going to look like let&amp;#39;s talk about the</text>
  <text start="534.45" dur="4.8">pension crisis that were in right now</text>
  <text start="536.76" dur="4.71">now we talked about this before and a</text>
  <text start="539.25" dur="4.83">lot of people who have been working for</text>
  <text start="541.47" dur="4.86">quite a while who are expecting a</text>
  <text start="544.08" dur="4.47">pension well you might have a problem</text>
  <text start="546.33" dur="4.65">with that and many individuals that I</text>
  <text start="548.55" dur="4.23">had on the x-ray to report spotlight you</text>
  <text start="550.98" dur="4.56">know talked about this and how the</text>
  <text start="552.78" dur="6.48">pension funds well they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="555.54" dur="6.93">be there when you want them now the</text>
  <text start="559.26" dur="5.43">nation has about 1,400 corporate pension</text>
  <text start="562.47" dur="4.11">plans and they&amp;#39;re facing a five hundred</text>
  <text start="564.69" dur="4.11">and fifty three billion shortfall and</text>
  <text start="566.58" dur="4.65">according to Boston College about 25</text>
  <text start="568.8" dur="7.62">percent will likely go broke in the next</text>

  <text start="579.3" dur="4.32">expecting a pension to fund their</text>
  <text start="580.89" dur="6.36">retirement will likely get absolutely</text>
  <text start="583.62" dur="4.73">nothing and it doesn&amp;#39;t even get better</text>
  <text start="587.25" dur="4.59">for the government</text>
  <text start="588.35" dur="5.95">according to Moody&amp;#39;s state federal and</text>

  <text start="594.3" dur="5.79">trillion short in funding the reason for</text>
  <text start="597.27" dur="5.97">the crisis is simple investment returns</text>
  <text start="600.09" dur="4.7">are way too low remember pension funds</text>
  <text start="603.24" dur="4.65">invest in stocks bonds real estate</text>
  <text start="604.79" dur="5.95">private equity and a many other</text>
  <text start="607.89" dur="6.27">different assets hoping to generate a</text>
  <text start="610.74" dur="7.53">safe return now they base this on an</text>

  <text start="618.27" dur="5.4">an eight percent return they&amp;#39;re getting</text>

  <text start="640.11" dur="4.65">that they&amp;#39;re going to have a problem</text>

  <text start="659.25" dur="2.22">same thing</text>
  <text start="660.15" dur="3.24">remember the interest rates have been</text>
  <text start="661.47" dur="4.86">brought down so we&amp;#39;re going to have a</text>
  <text start="663.39" dur="5.97">major pension crisis in this transition</text>
  <text start="666.33" dur="7.41">remember the transition is not going to</text>
  <text start="669.36" dur="7.08">be easy things need to be changed before</text>
  <text start="673.74" dur="6.03">the transition and we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="676.44" dur="5.49">changes being done right now with NAFTA</text>
  <text start="679.77" dur="5.1">TPP which was struck down by lateral</text>
  <text start="681.93" dur="5.58">trade agreements tariffs and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="684.87" dur="4.74">to hurt the economy certain businesses</text>
  <text start="687.51" dur="4.05">are going to feel the effect and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="689.61" dur="3.96">going to be very difficult because when</text>
  <text start="691.56" dur="4.92">you&amp;#39;re moving out of a central banking</text>
  <text start="693.57" dur="6.06">system you need to make these changes to</text>
  <text start="696.48" dur="5.37">prepare for the new system and yes it</text>
  <text start="699.63" dur="3.75">will get better we see already that the</text>
  <text start="701.85" dur="5.1">NAFTA talks they really haven&amp;#39;t gone</text>
  <text start="703.38" dur="8.04">anywhere and Trump now is speaking to</text>
  <text start="706.95" dur="6.12">the President of Mexico who is the</text>
  <text start="711.42" dur="4.77">president-elect right now yesterday we</text>
  <text start="713.07" dur="4.77">talked about how the New Mexican</text>
  <text start="716.19" dur="4.98">president sent a letter to Trump and</text>
  <text start="717.84" dur="5.67">Trump is now responding saying we need a</text>
  <text start="721.17" dur="5.64">quick we need renegotiation of the north</text>
  <text start="723.51" dur="5.34">american free trade agreement and we</text>
  <text start="726.81" dur="4.05">need to do this quickly because Trump</text>
  <text start="728.85" dur="4.14">understands that we are running out of</text>
  <text start="730.86" dur="4.35">time the central bank&amp;#39;s understand we</text>
  <text start="732.99" dur="4.08">are running out of time and we can see</text>
  <text start="735.21" dur="4.89">that with everything that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="737.07" dur="4.91">certain things are going to get hit I</text>
  <text start="740.1" dur="4.5">mean look at the farmers right now</text>
  <text start="741.98" dur="6.4">they&amp;#39;re feeling some pain they&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="744.6" dur="5.91">felt pain with this system that were in</text>
  <text start="748.38" dur="4.95">with the government getting involved and</text>
  <text start="750.51" dur="5.15">Trump announced that he&amp;#39;s going to have</text>
  <text start="753.33" dur="5.88">a multi-billion stimulus for farmers and</text>
  <text start="755.66" dur="6.27">when I see happening here is that with</text>
  <text start="759.21" dur="5.43">the stimulus plan and everything else</text>
  <text start="761.93" dur="5.5">Trump is trying to soften the blow and</text>
  <text start="764.64" dur="4.68">we need to understand that it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="767.43" dur="4.95">going to get worse before it gets better</text>
  <text start="769.32" dur="6.5">and what is happening here is Trump is</text>
  <text start="772.38" dur="5.76">going to be using the funds of the</text>
  <text start="775.82" dur="3.49">government right now because it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="778.14" dur="4.32">really matter because the system&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="779.31" dur="6.3">coming down to prop certain areas up</text>
  <text start="782.46" dur="6.51">this has to be done right now think</text>
  <text start="785.61" dur="6.18">about it if the central bankers had</text>
  <text start="788.97" dur="5.01">their way they would just bring down the</text>
  <text start="791.79" dur="3.96">system the way they did back in 2008</text>
  <text start="793.98" dur="4.23">they don&amp;#39;t care who gets hurt they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="795.75" dur="4.62">care who loses their jobs their wealth</text>
  <text start="798.21" dur="5.58">or anything like that they could care</text>
  <text start="800.37" dur="6.62">less but to make this transition yes</text>
  <text start="803.79" dur="5.16">certain areas are going to get hit but</text>
  <text start="806.99" dur="3.34">Trump and the Patriots what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="808.95" dur="3.18">trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="810.33" dur="3.72">it a soft landing can they make it soft</text>
  <text start="812.13" dur="4.02">they make it a soft landing for everyone</text>
  <text start="814.05" dur="4.83">no it&amp;#39;s just completely impossible and</text>
  <text start="816.15" dur="4.11">what&amp;#39;s happening right now is this is</text>
  <text start="818.88" dur="4.47">what it&amp;#39;s going to feel like and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="820.26" dur="6.3">gonna get worse as we break away from</text>
  <text start="823.35" dur="6.36">the central bank now q mentioned</text>
  <text start="826.56" dur="4.56">something very very important and put up</text>
  <text start="829.71" dur="4.02">a post which we&amp;#39;re going to discuss in</text>
  <text start="831.12" dur="5.55">the next report about the central bank</text>
  <text start="833.73" dur="6.5">about the Fed and Q kind of mentioned</text>
  <text start="836.67" dur="6.6">the Fed in other post but this one</text>
  <text start="840.23" dur="6.1">really came out and said you know that</text>
  <text start="843.27" dur="5.91">Trump is going to be taking over the Fed</text>
  <text start="846.33" dur="5.04">and this is a big one and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="849.18" dur="5.97">change a lot and we&amp;#39;ll be talking about</text>
  <text start="851.37" dur="5.94">that in the next report but you can</text>
  <text start="855.15" dur="6.12">that everything is moving in that</text>
  <text start="857.31" dur="7.77">direction you need to remove or control</text>
  <text start="861.27" dur="7.98">the central bank you need to dictate and</text>
  <text start="865.08" dur="6.99">take away their private organization you</text>
  <text start="869.25" dur="5.76">need to audit them you need to have it</text>
  <text start="872.07" dur="5.85">fully transparent to the American people</text>
  <text start="875.01" dur="6.12">so everyone understands and sees what is</text>
  <text start="877.92" dur="5.67">going on without that you can&amp;#39;t change</text>
  <text start="881.13" dur="4.59">anything and remember the central banks</text>
  <text start="883.59" dur="2.37">they&amp;#39;re not just gonna say hey here you</text>
  <text start="885.72" dur="2.49">go</text>
  <text start="885.96" dur="4.92">no big deal they&amp;#39;re gonna fight they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="890.88" dur="7.2">push until they can&amp;#39;t push anymore so we</text>
  <text start="895.11" dur="6.69">are in this phase right now where the</text>
  <text start="898.08" dur="6.93">entire economic system is being prepared</text>
  <text start="901.8" dur="5.46">for a transition and we&amp;#39;re going to get</text>
  <text start="905.01" dur="5.4">to the next phase where the attacks on</text>
  <text start="907.26" dur="5.07">the Fed well it&amp;#39;s going to go mainstream</text>
  <text start="910.41" dur="4.17">well the mainstream media actually</text>
  <text start="912.33" dur="4.5">report about it we don&amp;#39;t know but it</text>
  <text start="914.58" dur="4.53">will go mainstream and people will start</text>
  <text start="916.83" dur="4.23">to realize what is happening and we are</text>
  <text start="919.11" dur="4.62">headed in that direction because time is</text>
  <text start="921.06" dur="6.03">running out the economy is failing right</text>
  <text start="923.73" dur="6.09">now at a rapid pace the manipulated</text>

  <text start="940.95" dur="4.5">realize this very very quickly and we</text>
  <text start="943.29" dur="4.41">already see that Trump dropped some</text>
  <text start="945.45" dur="4.29">breadcrumbs about the Fed about raising</text>
