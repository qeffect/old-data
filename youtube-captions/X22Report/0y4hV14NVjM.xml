  <text start="67.67" dur="6.99">see that Greece has approved a deal the</text>
  <text start="72.47" dur="4.02">government of Greece said okay it looks</text>
  <text start="74.66" dur="4.56">good they forwarded on to the creditors</text>
  <text start="76.49" dur="5.519">and right now the creditors are looking</text>
  <text start="79.22" dur="4.95">at it and they&amp;#39;re saying hmmm this just</text>
  <text start="82.009" dur="4.591">doesn&amp;#39;t meet our standards maybe we can</text>
  <text start="84.17" dur="5.58">have more negotiations but we want</text>
  <text start="86.6" dur="4.98">additional things in there and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="89.75" dur="4.38">coming out of Greece is that capital</text>
  <text start="91.58" dur="6.269">controls they&amp;#39;re not going to end I mean</text>
  <text start="94.13" dur="6.299">we heard that this Friday the banks are</text>
  <text start="97.849" dur="4.38">going to reopen everything&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="100.429" dur="3.75">fine and what we&amp;#39;re hearing right now is</text>
  <text start="102.229" dur="6.06">that capital controls imposed on Greece</text>
  <text start="104.179" dur="7.44">if there is no deal whatsoever they</text>
  <text start="108.289" dur="6.08">could remain in place for another two</text>
  <text start="111.619" dur="5.67">months this is coming from the economy</text>
  <text start="114.369" dur="6.191">minister he said the banks could reopen</text>
  <text start="117.289" dur="5.22">as soon as next week if an agreement is</text>
  <text start="120.56" dur="5.75">made with the creditors at this point</text>
  <text start="122.509" dur="6.271">right now it seems that the agreement is</text>
  <text start="126.31" dur="5.02">not what the creditors are looking for</text>
  <text start="128.78" dur="5.34">and the Greek people are saying and this</text>
  <text start="131.33" dur="5.58">is coming from a snap poll by bridging</text>
  <text start="134.12" dur="5.25">Europe seventy-nine percent of the</text>
  <text start="136.91" dur="6.74">respondents said they were against the</text>
  <text start="139.37" dur="8.699">third bailout that the Greek government</text>
  <text start="143.65" dur="6.28">proposed a further seventy-four percent</text>
  <text start="148.069" dur="3.75">stating they believe that the Greek</text>
  <text start="149.93" dur="6.69">government&amp;#39;s proposal goes against the</text>
  <text start="151.819" dur="7.261">61 percent no vote so the people voted</text>
  <text start="156.62" dur="3.9">in a referendum they voted no and the</text>
  <text start="159.08" dur="3.12">Greek government pretty much put</text>
  <text start="160.52" dur="3.48">together the same plan they voted no on</text>
  <text start="162.2" dur="3.63">and the</text>
  <text start="164" dur="3.84">realizes and they were scratching their</text>
  <text start="165.83" dur="5.97">head saying what is going on here it</text>
  <text start="167.84" dur="8.01">makes no sense and we see the German</text>
  <text start="171.8" dur="7.74">Finance Minister has once again gone on</text>
  <text start="175.85" dur="5.22">the offensive saying that there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="179.54" dur="4.53">to be no debt relief there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="181.07" dur="5.19">no debt restructuring now again if they</text>
  <text start="184.07" dur="4.95">do any type of debt restructuring it</text>
  <text start="186.26" dur="5.73">will be done privately that will not</text>
  <text start="189.02" dur="5.28">broadcast that broadcast as to the</text>
  <text start="191.99" dur="4.469">entire world will be done in secret</text>
  <text start="194.3" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;ll be gag order so nobody knows</text>
  <text start="196.459" dur="5.401">what was done but right now he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="198.98" dur="6.33">to the world no we&amp;#39;re not going to write</text>
  <text start="201.86" dur="5.52">off any of this debt Greece has to pay</text>
  <text start="205.31" dur="5.13">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that other</text>
  <text start="207.38" dur="6.59">countries in the euro zone like Finland</text>
  <text start="210.44" dur="8.19">Estonia Lithuania Slovakia Slovenia</text>
  <text start="213.97" dur="7.239">netherlands they&amp;#39;re supporting having</text>
  <text start="218.63" dur="7.05">greece temporarily suspended from the</text>
  <text start="221.209" dur="8.761">euro membership saying okay you can exit</text>
  <text start="225.68" dur="6.33">right now temporarily good luck and I</text>
  <text start="229.97" dur="3.32">think what Germany is trying to do at</text>
  <text start="232.01" dur="5.16">this point in time because they</text>
  <text start="233.29" dur="5.259">recommended this also they want grease</text>
  <text start="237.17" dur="4.77">the server it&amp;#39;s like a punishment like</text>
  <text start="238.549" dur="6.391">we will suspend you and see if you can</text>
  <text start="241.94" dur="5.91">make it but again tsipras has made a</text>
  <text start="244.94" dur="6.66">deal with Putin now is this part of his</text>
  <text start="247.85" dur="7.889">plan to continually give the creditors a</text>
  <text start="251.6" dur="6.75">little bit but not all of it and have</text>
  <text start="255.739" dur="4.861">the creditors turn it down because he</text>
  <text start="258.35" dur="4.14">said this is our best proposal yet and</text>
  <text start="260.6" dur="4.02">the creditors are looking at it saying</text>
  <text start="262.49" dur="3.929">no we won&amp;#39;t we want to temporarily</text>
  <text start="264.62" dur="4.56">suspend you now if they temporarily</text>
  <text start="266.419" dur="4.921">suspend grease from the eurozone Greece</text>
  <text start="269.18" dur="4.32">could say you know something maybe we</text>
  <text start="271.34" dur="4.86">should turn towards Russia with a brick</text>
  <text start="273.5" dur="6.12">system now this could be part of his</text>
  <text start="276.2" dur="6.6">plan Vera focus as we know he&amp;#39;s resigned</text>
  <text start="279.62" dur="8.34">and he is convinced that the German</text>
  <text start="282.8" dur="9.69">minister finance minister says he wants</text>
  <text start="287.96" dur="7.26">Greece to temporarily exit the eurozone</text>
  <text start="292.49" dur="5.62">and what does he mean by that base on</text>
  <text start="295.22" dur="5.26">months of negotiation he says his convey</text>
  <text start="298.11" dur="4.74">Shin is that the German Finance Minister</text>
  <text start="300.48" dur="4.83">wants Greece to be pushed out of the</text>
  <text start="302.85" dur="6.09">single currency to put fear of God into</text>
  <text start="305.31" dur="5.87">the other countries now of course he</text>
  <text start="308.94" dur="6.27">doesn&amp;#39;t want grease to do it on its own</text>
  <text start="311.18" dur="6.16">they want to say okay here you&amp;#39;re no</text>
  <text start="315.21" dur="5.85">longer part of this right now and have</text>
  <text start="317.34" dur="6">France Italy shake in their boots I</text>
  <text start="321.06" dur="5.01">don&amp;#39;t know if this is going to work I</text>
  <text start="323.34" dur="4.47">think it&amp;#39;s going to have the opposite</text>
  <text start="326.07" dur="3.66">effect I think they&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="327.81" dur="4.26">Greece saying okay we&amp;#39;re temporarily</text>
  <text start="329.73" dur="4.47">suspended we&amp;#39;re going to look some other</text>
  <text start="332.07" dur="3.57">place because we need to survive they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="334.2" dur="3">going to print up their own drachma</text>
  <text start="335.64" dur="4.77">there&amp;#39;s been sightings all over the</text>
  <text start="337.2" dur="4.89">place and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to watch this</text>
  <text start="340.41" dur="3.06">situation and we&amp;#39;ll have to watch it</text>
  <text start="342.09" dur="3.48">over the weekend to see how things turn</text>
  <text start="343.47" dur="4.11">out but again this is not helping the</text>
  <text start="345.57" dur="5.88">people and even if they do come to some</text>
  <text start="347.58" dur="5.1">type of an agreement this still does not</text>
  <text start="351.45" dur="6.18">help the people because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="352.68" dur="7.92">austerity implemented pushed on the</text>
  <text start="357.63" dur="6.09">people and this does not help them it</text>
  <text start="360.6" dur="5.79">doesn&amp;#39;t create jobs it doesn&amp;#39;t help the</text>
  <text start="363.72" dur="4.47">people get back on their feet because as</text>
  <text start="366.39" dur="4.95">we know all of this goes to the banks</text>
  <text start="368.19" dur="5.64">anyhow so what they&amp;#39;re talking about at</text>
  <text start="371.34" dur="5.82">this point doesn&amp;#39;t help the people and</text>
  <text start="373.83" dur="6.51">if they do get another bailout how long</text>
  <text start="377.16" dur="6.33">before we&amp;#39;re in the same exact position</text>
  <text start="380.34" dur="6.93">because as we know this is not going to</text>
  <text start="383.49" dur="6.3">help Greece either way they have to look</text>
  <text start="387.27" dur="5.48">towards a different direction to spur</text>
  <text start="389.79" dur="5.82">economic growth either create their own</text>
  <text start="392.75" dur="7.03">currency remove themselves from the euro</text>
  <text start="395.61" dur="6.66">maybe get some help from Putin this will</text>
  <text start="399.78" dur="6.81">help the country this will spur economic</text>
  <text start="402.27" dur="6.27">growth but we&amp;#39;ll have to watch this we</text>
  <text start="406.59" dur="4.65">see that Iran right now is inviting</text>
  <text start="408.54" dur="6.27">Russia to attend the gas exporting</text>
  <text start="411.24" dur="8.28">countries form summit and they invited</text>
  <text start="414.81" dur="6.78">Putin and they invited heads of states</text>
  <text start="419.52" dur="5.15">of five more countries to attend the</text>
  <text start="421.59" dur="6.78">third gas exporting countries form and</text>
  <text start="424.67" dur="5.11">again if or when the sanctions are</text>
  <text start="428.37" dur="6.03">dropped</text>
  <text start="429.78" dur="5.58">and this peace plan goes forward I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="434.4" dur="2.489">know if the United States government</text>
  <text start="435.36" dur="5.16">central bankers are going to get what</text>
  <text start="436.889" dur="5.311">they exactly wanted and this is why we</text>
  <text start="440.52" dur="4.44">need to watch this because we know that</text>
  <text start="442.2" dur="8.07">this is not about nuclear weapons this</text>
  <text start="444.96" dur="7.62">is about taking over a country putting</text>
  <text start="450.27" dur="4.53">the dollar on their natural resources</text>
  <text start="452.58" dur="5.339">the only reason weapons comes up is</text>
  <text start="454.8" dur="4.5">because it makes it easier for the</text>
  <text start="457.919" dur="4.831">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="459.3" dur="7.08">to disarm a country and then go in and</text>
  <text start="462.75" dur="4.83">get what they want that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="466.38" dur="3.18">doing this is what they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="467.58" dur="3.54">they don&amp;#39;t have a nuclear weapon they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="469.56" dur="4.26">not concerned about that they keep going</text>
  <text start="471.12" dur="7.89">after dip certain other things there</text>
  <text start="473.82" dur="7.55">everyday military assets and they keep</text>
  <text start="479.01" dur="5.79">trying they keep bringing up new and new</text>
  <text start="481.37" dur="5.38">proposals trying different tactics the</text>
  <text start="484.8" dur="4.14">trying to get Iran to say you listen</text>
  <text start="486.75" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;re out of this deal but so far it has</text>
  <text start="488.94" dur="7.65">not worked Iran wants the sanctions</text>
  <text start="491.52" dur="7.59">removed Iran wants the deal Iran wants</text>
  <text start="496.59" dur="4.889">to pivot towards Russia to the brick</text>
  <text start="499.11" dur="5.04">system and I think this is where the</text>
  <text start="501.479" dur="4.591">problems coming in this is why it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="504.15" dur="4.47">going on for so long because as we can</text>
  <text start="506.07" dur="6.54">see over 30 years now they have not</text>
  <text start="508.62" dur="6.359">created one nuclear weapon there&amp;#39;s IAEA</text>
  <text start="512.61" dur="6.33">inspections have never found a thing</text>
  <text start="514.979" dur="5.911">they found no evidence whatsoever most</text>
  <text start="518.94" dur="6.63">of it has been created by the CIA and</text>
  <text start="520.89" dur="6.99">planted so we&amp;#39;ll have to watch this very</text>
  <text start="525.57" dur="5.04">closely with the p5 plus one talks we</text>
  <text start="527.88" dur="4.59">see in Afghanistan there are now</text>
  <text start="530.61" dur="4.77">warnings coming out that the Islamic</text>
  <text start="532.47" dur="6.51">state is planning attacks against NATO</text>
  <text start="535.38" dur="6.54">troops Pentagon officials claim that</text>
  <text start="538.98" dur="6.06">they have evidence that yes there are</text>
  <text start="541.92" dur="6.33">attacks planned and they&amp;#39;re planning to</text>
  <text start="545.04" dur="5.94">launch attacks against US and NATO now</text>
  <text start="548.25" dur="5.07">again as we know the United States</text>
  <text start="550.98" dur="4.95">government is not going to leave</text>
  <text start="553.32" dur="5.76">Afghanistan now they&amp;#39;re making the case</text>
  <text start="555.93" dur="5.31">of why they need to stay and why more</text>
  <text start="559.08" dur="4.53">troops need to go into this area because</text>
  <text start="561.24" dur="4.5">the situation as we can see</text>
  <text start="563.61" dur="5">it&amp;#39;s continually getting worse and this</text>
  <text start="565.74" dur="6.3">is what they&amp;#39;re trying to tell everyone</text>
  <text start="568.61" dur="4.9">the new ambassador for Ukraine is saying</text>
  <text start="572.04" dur="5.78">you know something Ukraine needs a</text>
  <text start="573.51" dur="7.88">thousand javelin systems and these</text>
  <text start="577.82" dur="6.759">javelin systems which are javelin</text>
  <text start="581.39" dur="5.439">missiles they are portable anti-tank</text>
  <text start="584.579" dur="4.651">missiles of 3rd generation designed to</text>
  <text start="586.829" dur="4.291">target armored vehicles and low-flying</text>
  <text start="589.23" dur="3.75">targets and they&amp;#39;re saying they need</text>
  <text start="591.12" dur="4.11">about a thousand of them to protect</text>
  <text start="592.98" dur="3.479">themselves against the southeastern</text>
  <text start="595.23" dur="3.72">people because we don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="596.459" dur="7.141">they&amp;#39;re planning so they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="598.95" dur="5.91">get lethal weapons into the country we</text>
  <text start="603.6" dur="2.91">know they&amp;#39;re getting lethal weapons from</text>
  <text start="604.86" dur="3.36">other European countries and most likely</text>
  <text start="606.51" dur="5.67">with the United States they&amp;#39;re coming in</text>
  <text start="608.22" dur="5.94">covertly but they want the more advanced</text>
  <text start="612.18" dur="4.08">weapons in the country and we know they</text>
  <text start="614.16" dur="8.07">are planning some type of an offensive</text>
  <text start="616.26" dur="8.73">and we can see in Syria we can see in</text>
  <text start="622.23" dur="5.419">Ukraine things are starting to ramp up</text>
  <text start="624.99" dur="6.63">we see the United States government is</text>
  <text start="627.649" dur="7.3">pushing the UN to investigate Syrian the</text>
  <text start="631.62" dur="7.05">Syrian chemical attacks with chlorine</text>
  <text start="634.949" dur="6.211">gas and we know this happened once</text>
  <text start="638.67" dur="4.8">before if we go back to august 2013 so</text>
  <text start="641.16" dur="5.4">at this point in time we see they are</text>
  <text start="643.47" dur="8.52">pushing and getting ready for a major</text>
  <text start="646.56" dur="9.269">type of an event to push an offensive in</text>
  <text start="651.99" dur="6.12">Syria and Ukraine and this is something</text>
  <text start="655.829" dur="5.01">we need to continually look at and track</text>
