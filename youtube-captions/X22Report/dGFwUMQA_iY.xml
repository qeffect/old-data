  <text start="92.34" dur="5.94">was a referendum we still have many</text>
  <text start="95.67" dur="5.759">other stages to go through before the UK</text>

  <text start="129.33" dur="5.239">market has fallen by 500 points and</text>
  <text start="131.459" dur="6.301">we&amp;#39;ve seen this all across the globe and</text>
  <text start="134.569" dur="6.791">one thing we need to remember is that</text>
  <text start="137.76" dur="6.449">the central bankers they are just not</text>
  <text start="141.36" dur="7.53">going to let the people do whatever they</text>
  <text start="144.209" dur="8.881">want they want control that is the</text>
  <text start="148.89" dur="8.34">endgame control of the population so at</text>
  <text start="153.09" dur="6.39">this point we do see the people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="157.23" dur="4.74">voicing their concerns they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="159.48" dur="4.35">telling governments the central bankers</text>
  <text start="161.97" dur="5.4">we don&amp;#39;t want this anymore</text>
  <text start="163.83" dur="6.21">now the central bankers are going to</text>
  <text start="167.37" dur="4.89">attack and this is something that we</text>
  <text start="170.04" dur="4.59">need to watch and we will see this come</text>
  <text start="172.26" dur="4.89">up in the next couple of weeks a couple</text>
  <text start="174.63" dur="5.28">of days but during this period of time</text>
  <text start="177.15" dur="5.39">they&amp;#39;re gonna blame everything on the</text>
  <text start="179.91" dur="6.03">people look what look what you&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="182.54" dur="7.39">you voted on this now the economies are</text>
  <text start="185.94" dur="6.57">failing everything&amp;#39;s falling apart it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="189.93" dur="4.82">because of what you have done you need</text>
  <text start="192.51" dur="6.18">to stay with the central banking system</text>
  <text start="194.75" dur="6.4">well we&amp;#39;re ahead of the game we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="198.69" dur="5.1">following the economy not just here in</text>
  <text start="201.15" dur="4.5">the United States but globally and we</text>
  <text start="203.79" dur="6.81">understand that this has been declining</text>
  <text start="205.65" dur="8.01">for a very long time the economy is one</text>
  <text start="210.6" dur="5.91">big complete illusion controlled by the</text>
  <text start="213.66" dur="6.03">central banking system and we need to</text>
  <text start="216.51" dur="6.36">realize at this point that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="219.69" dur="5.37">going to just give away their system to</text>
  <text start="222.87" dur="4.65">a bunch of people who said yes we want</text>
  <text start="225.06" dur="4.59">to be free yes there&amp;#39;s a lot of talk</text>
  <text start="227.52" dur="4.29">about how the central bank is saying yes</text>
  <text start="229.65" dur="4.52">okay we&amp;#39;re gonna follow the procedures</text>
  <text start="231.81" dur="5.73">and stuff but we will see the true</text>
  <text start="234.17" dur="6.49">central bank show its teeth in the weeks</text>
  <text start="237.54" dur="5.64">ahead just look at Greece it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="240.66" dur="5.12">example did the people get what they</text>
  <text start="243.18" dur="5.73">really wanted or did the opposite happen</text>
  <text start="245.78" dur="5.35">well the opposite did happen but when we</text>
  <text start="248.91" dur="4.56">look at the economy here in the United</text>
  <text start="251.13" dur="4.32">States and around the world we see many</text>
  <text start="253.47" dur="5.88">different things occurring at the same</text>
  <text start="255.45" dur="7.08">time everything has been falling apart</text>
  <text start="259.35" dur="7.47">for a very long time the economy is held</text>
  <text start="262.53" dur="6.449">together with tape spit and glue and no</text>
  <text start="266.82" dur="5.88">matter what the central bank&amp;#39;s say the</text>
  <text start="268.979" dur="5.901">economy was never doing well we see here</text>

  <text start="404.249" dur="6.271">six years and we&amp;#39;re looking at this and</text>
  <text start="408.24" dur="4.679">when we look at all the other economic</text>
  <text start="410.52" dur="7.169">indicators they&amp;#39;re all pointing to one</text>
  <text start="412.919" dur="8.641">thing that the economy is collapsing so</text>
  <text start="417.689" dur="7.171">now we have this brexit where the people</text>
  <text start="421.56" dur="4.56">have voted on this referendum saying we</text>
  <text start="424.86" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t want the EU</text>
  <text start="426.12" dur="4.89">now during this whole period of time I</text>
  <text start="428.58" dur="4.47">noticed the corporate media they were</text>
  <text start="431.01" dur="4.11">trying to make it look like that people</text>
  <text start="433.05" dur="4.47">are voting to stay and then eventually</text>
  <text start="435.12" dur="3.99">what happened is there were just too</text>
  <text start="437.52" dur="3.72">many votes and they couldn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="439.11" dur="4.29">manipulate it in a way that they wanted</text>
  <text start="441.24" dur="4.32">to to show that the people wanted to</text>
  <text start="443.4" dur="3.93">stay in the EU and they couldn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="445.56" dur="4.02">anything about it and now the people</text>
  <text start="447.33" dur="5.28">have voted that they want to leave now</text>
  <text start="449.58" dur="6.75">David Cameron he decided to resign stock</text>
  <text start="452.61" dur="6.48">markets crashed gold surged up by quite</text>
  <text start="456.33" dur="5.36">a bit and when we look at this we can</text>
  <text start="459.09" dur="7.549">see that the central bankers right now</text>
  <text start="461.69" dur="9.94">they are scrambling to keep this system</text>
  <text start="466.639" dur="8.111">alive long enough because what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="471.63" dur="6.59">coming out with is that this is because</text>
  <text start="474.75" dur="6.03">of what the people just did and</text>
  <text start="478.22" dur="6.85">statements of the g7 finance ministers</text>
  <text start="480.78" dur="6.27">and central bank governors well they</text>
  <text start="485.07" dur="3.78">went on to say that they respect the</text>
  <text start="487.05" dur="4.92">intention expressed today by the people</text>
  <text start="488.85" dur="5.01">of the United Kingdom to exist to exit</text>
  <text start="491.97" dur="3.81">from the European Union we are</text>
  <text start="493.86" dur="3.21">monitoring market developments following</text>
  <text start="495.78" dur="4.71">the outcome of the referendum on the</text>
  <text start="497.07" dur="5.279">UK&amp;#39;s membership of the EU we affirm our</text>
  <text start="500.49" dur="4.02">assessment that the UK economy and</text>
  <text start="502.349" dur="3.781">financial sector remain resilient and</text>
  <text start="504.51" dur="4.26">are confident that the UK authorities</text>
  <text start="506.13" dur="5.49">are well positioned to address the</text>
  <text start="508.77" dur="4.92">consequences of the referendum outcome</text>
  <text start="511.62" dur="4.46">so they&amp;#39;re already setting this up</text>
  <text start="513.69" dur="6.12">saying they&amp;#39;re going to be consequences</text>
  <text start="516.08" dur="5.68">now we know that none of these countries</text>
  <text start="519.81" dur="5.76">need a private western central bank</text>
  <text start="521.76" dur="5.1">system look at Iceland for instance we</text>
  <text start="525.57" dur="3.36">went through the same exact thing they</text>
  <text start="526.86" dur="3.479">told us that it&amp;#39;s going to be a disaster</text>
  <text start="528.93" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re never going to be able to make</text>
  <text start="530.339" dur="5.071">it and their economy is doing well they</text>
  <text start="532.95" dur="4.56">put their bankers in jail they took</text>
  <text start="535.41" dur="5.52">control of their country actually Putin</text>
  <text start="537.51" dur="6.329">did the same exact thing now we look at</text>
  <text start="540.93" dur="4.98">this and we see that the central banks</text>
  <text start="543.839" dur="5.161">they&amp;#39;re all ready to provide liquidity</text>
  <text start="545.91" dur="4.5">the Bank of England governor declared</text>
  <text start="549" dur="5.1">that the central bank can provide an</text>
  <text start="550.41" dur="6.09">extra 250 billion pounds through its</text>
  <text start="554.1" dur="4.29">existing facilities to make sure that</text>
  <text start="556.5" dur="3.269">everything is okay the Fed came out and</text>
  <text start="558.39" dur="4.289">said there</text>
  <text start="559.769" dur="5.37">ready and willing to take this freely</text>
  <text start="562.679" dur="5.46">created currency out of thin air and</text>
  <text start="565.139" dur="5.401">provided to anyone that needs it but</text>
  <text start="568.139" dur="6.06">very interestingly we are seeing other</text>
  <text start="570.54" dur="5.789">nations now we&amp;#39;re seeing Scotland saying</text>
  <text start="574.199" dur="4.971">maybe we should have a Scotland</text>
  <text start="576.329" dur="5.49">independence referendum once again</text>
  <text start="579.17" dur="3.94">Italy&amp;#39;s Northern League is saying</text>
  <text start="581.819" dur="4.651">they&amp;#39;re going to launch an EU referendum</text>
  <text start="583.11" dur="5.819">campaign and they&amp;#39;re collecting</text>
  <text start="586.47" dur="5.399">signatures right now for the referendum</text>
  <text start="588.929" dur="6.241">we also see France Germany Sweden the</text>
  <text start="591.869" dur="6.09">Netherlands Czech Republic Hungary these</text>
  <text start="595.17" dur="5.759">countries they&amp;#39;re looking to follow what</text>
  <text start="597.959" dur="6.24">the you the UK is doing right now and we</text>
  <text start="600.929" dur="7.231">see since this is happening many</text>
  <text start="604.199" dur="7.5">countries and investors are now piling</text>
  <text start="608.16" dur="7.95">into the dollar and but the brexit means</text>
  <text start="611.699" dur="7.531">is that more passengers are going to be</text>
  <text start="616.11" dur="4.49">loading onto the US dollar and we know</text>
  <text start="619.23" dur="6.75">what&amp;#39;s going to happen to the dollar</text>
  <text start="620.6" dur="8.739">eventually and this explains why the fed</text>
  <text start="625.98" dur="5.25">has stepped up their swap lines the</text>
  <text start="629.339" dur="3.81">Federal Reserve is preparing to provide</text>

  <text start="639.509" dur="7.89">could have adverse implications for the</text>
  <text start="641.699" dur="8.13">US economy now when we look at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="647.399" dur="3.93">going on with this brexit we see a lot</text>
  <text start="649.829" dur="2.73">of propaganda out there we see the</text>
  <text start="651.329" dur="3.151">corporate media the US government</text>
  <text start="652.559" dur="3.59">central banks are out there saying that</text>
  <text start="654.48" dur="5.279">this is going to be a disastrous</text>
  <text start="656.149" dur="8.761">scenario now we know the economy of the</text>

  <text start="669.809" dur="8.07">this now this gives the central bank</text>
  <text start="674.269" dur="7.81">ammunition to say ah this is why the</text>
  <text start="677.879" dur="8.04">economy is failing right now and we can</text>
  <text start="682.079" dur="7.59">see that the brexit this poses a problem</text>

  <text start="1146.909" dur="10.26">their agenda now out in Turkey turkey</text>
  <text start="1153.09" dur="6.42">does not want politicians to go to the</text>
  <text start="1157.169" dur="5.281">Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey</text>

  <text start="1165.36" dur="7.679">delegations they can visit this is very</text>
  <text start="1169.23" dur="5.67">interesting we also see out in Syria the</text>
  <text start="1173.039" dur="2.76">Syrian opposition the moderate rebels</text>
