  <text start="306.27" dur="4.44">looks like there is another gun</text>
  <text start="308.76" dur="4.38">confiscation bill introduced into the</text>

  <text start="314.67" dur="4.47">claims to be aimed at removing guns from</text>
  <text start="317.1" dur="4.5">domestic abusers now they&amp;#39;re trying all</text>
  <text start="319.14" dur="5.37">different angles to go after the guns</text>
  <text start="321.6" dur="4.11">and again like I said the Constitution</text>
  <text start="324.51" dur="3.09">Bill of Rights this is the law of the</text>
  <text start="325.71" dur="4.32">land nothing can be above it all they</text>
  <text start="327.6" dur="5.25">can do is create thousands and thousands</text>
  <text start="330.03" dur="5.94">of laws to try to limit the rights of</text>
  <text start="332.85" dur="6.06">the people but it cannot be done and</text>
  <text start="335.97" dur="4.74">they continually try there are thousands</text>
  <text start="338.91" dur="3.96">upon thousands of laws and they</text>
  <text start="340.71" dur="4.02">continually try to do this because they</text>
  <text start="342.87" dur="5.07">want to limit it as much as they</text>
  <text start="344.73" dur="5.13">possibly can and right now what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="347.94" dur="3.96">saying is that the bill termed the</text>
  <text start="349.86" dur="5.01">domestic violence gun homicide</text>
  <text start="351.9" dur="4.98">prevention act of 2014 the legislation</text>

  <text start="364.53" dur="4.05">states who have domestic violence gun</text>
  <text start="366.29" dur="4.24">prohibitions and enforce regulations</text>

  <text start="390.09" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re doing this right perfectly at</text>
  <text start="393.24" dur="3.78">the time they&amp;#39;re gonna testify they</text>
  <text start="395.16" dur="4.009">introduced this bill and they do this</text>
  <text start="397.02" dur="5.19">every single time to try to motivate</text>
  <text start="399.169" dur="5.681">everyone into passing these bills and</text>
  <text start="402.21" dur="5.16">they put out an advertisement showing a</text>
  <text start="404.85" dur="5.789">woman in their child in their house and</text>
  <text start="407.37" dur="6.15">this crazed man ex-husband comes to the</text>
  <text start="410.639" dur="6.631">door starts you know banging on the door</text>
  <text start="413.52" dur="6.24">and she doesn&amp;#39;t have enough time uh to</text>
  <text start="417.27" dur="5.76">call 911 binos the police will not get</text>
  <text start="419.76" dur="6.15">here in in the amount of time needed so</text>
  <text start="423.03" dur="6.949">the band breaks in with his gun and</text>
  <text start="425.91" dur="7.56">that&amp;#39;s it well we have to look at this</text>
  <text start="429.979" dur="5.981">first of all that this advertisement</text>
  <text start="433.47" dur="4.74">shows us that the police aren&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="435.96" dur="5.73">be there to protect you let&amp;#39;s replace</text>
  <text start="438.21" dur="7.14">this man&amp;#39;s gun with a bat is she any</text>

  <text start="457.35" dur="6.96">the gun wouldn&amp;#39;t make a difference would</text>
  <text start="460.889" dur="6.15">it and if she was properly trained that</text>
  <text start="464.31" dur="4.829">xpedx husband wouldn&amp;#39;t even be coming</text>
  <text start="467.039" dur="5.371">around now the point of all of this is</text>
  <text start="469.139" dur="4.921">really to take the guns away from the</text>
  <text start="472.41" dur="3.42">American people this has nothing to do</text>

  <text start="485.28" dur="3.66">something to their wife and their child</text>

  <text start="496.56" dur="4.859">happening or is this just ginned up</text>
  <text start="498.78" dur="5.28">being played out to create another law</text>
  <text start="501.419" dur="5.93">to try to get everyone&amp;#39;s guns and this</text>
  <text start="504.06" dur="7.729">is exactly what is going on right now</text>

  <text start="1022.47" dur="5.51">at the same time and of course what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1024.99" dur="5.939">happening here is Israel is continually</text>
  <text start="1027.98" dur="4.39">bombarding Gaza they haven&amp;#39;t stopped of</text>

  <text start="1042.929" dur="4.351">one who&amp;#39;s doing it and of course the</text>
  <text start="1044.88" dur="4.98">ceasefire agreements and the peace</text>
  <text start="1047.28" dur="5.19">agreements is an ultimatum and this is</text>
  <text start="1049.86" dur="4.02">very interesting my son was watching</text>

  <text start="1056.49" dur="3.36">coming from obi-wan Kenobi I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1057.96" dur="5.94">if everyone has seen the Star Wars films</text>

  <text start="1063.9" dur="7.32">black and white where if you don&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="1068.01" dur="5.7">this way that is it and this is very</text>
  <text start="1071.22" dur="4.38">interesting when I look at our leaders</text>
  <text start="1073.71" dur="3.959">and they continually</text>
  <text start="1075.6" dur="3.959">give ultimatums they only see it in</text>
  <text start="1077.669" dur="4.26">black and white they don&amp;#39;t see anything</text>
  <text start="1079.559" dur="5.161">else they don&amp;#39;t look for peace it just</text>
  <text start="1081.929" dur="6">reminded me of the Star Wars film and</text>
  <text start="1084.72" dur="6">how the cysts think and they only think</text>
  <text start="1087.929" dur="5.13">in one way do it this way or don&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="1090.72" dur="6.12">at all and I will kill you and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1093.059" dur="7.711">interesting how it really fits into our</text>
  <text start="1096.84" dur="8.37">society to today from what these films</text>

  <text start="1135.45" dur="2.94">Department now it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1137.22" dur="3.66">because we&amp;#39;re all talking about the</text>

  <text start="1146.309" dur="5.341">we have an incident occur now I have to</text>
  <text start="1149.19" dur="4.59">hand it to Dabu 7 he came up and he</text>
  <text start="1151.65" dur="5.399">found that the United States was behind</text>

  <text start="1157.049" dur="7.231">and compositions and methods thereof and</text>
  <text start="1159.57" dur="9.51">this patent was filed in October of 2009</text>
  <text start="1164.28" dur="7.56">and I saw Dabu 7 he saw that the United</text>
  <text start="1169.08" dur="5.82">States was on this patent but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1171.84" dur="6.089">very interesting about this is that at</text>
  <text start="1174.9" dur="5.55">the same time in 2009 once the patent</text>
  <text start="1177.929" dur="5.401">was filed researchers received a</text>

  <text start="1183.33" dur="5.66">from the National Institute of Health</text>

  <text start="1192.12" dur="6.75">in the US buyer bio warfare research</text>
  <text start="1194.73" dur="6.3">community down in Sierra Leone now all</text>
  <text start="1198.87" dur="4.38">this fits together and it looks like</text>
  <text start="1201.03" dur="6.06">they must have been creating some type</text>
  <text start="1203.25" dur="5.669">of strain of Ebola which is man-made and</text>
  <text start="1207.09" dur="2.34">it looks like they were trying to figure</text>
  <text start="1208.919" dur="5.101">out</text>
  <text start="1209.43" dur="8.07">a cure for it because this also reminds</text>
  <text start="1214.02" dur="5.7">me of the movie V for Vendetta where the</text>
  <text start="1217.5" dur="6.06">government created a manufactured</text>

  <text start="1240.99" dur="7.32">it seems like this is exactly what is</text>
  <text start="1244.32" dur="7.47">going on right now the question is what</text>
  <text start="1248.31" dur="7.35">were they doing down in Africa what were</text>
  <text start="1251.79" dur="9.27">they doing they were doing some type of</text>
