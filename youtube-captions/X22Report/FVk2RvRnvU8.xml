  <text start="141.12" dur="3.81">been talking about the stock market he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.22" dur="3.57">been talking about this before he became</text>
  <text start="144.93" dur="4.23">president because he knows that this</text>

  <text start="151.35" dur="6.21">you know something we need to use their</text>
  <text start="154.26" dur="4.979">tools against them and we need to show</text>
  <text start="157.56" dur="4.109">that the economy is strong because they</text>
  <text start="159.239" dur="4.65">know that their plan was to show that</text>
  <text start="161.669" dur="3.191">this economy is falling apart and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="163.889" dur="2.681">because of what Ron</text>
  <text start="164.86" dur="3.06">has been doing and we know this is not</text>
  <text start="166.57" dur="2.94">true at all this is why we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="167.92" dur="3.33">following the economy this is why we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="169.51" dur="3.84">been delving into the numbers not the</text>
  <text start="171.25" dur="4.14">mainstream media numbers not the fake</text>
  <text start="173.35" dur="3.27">statistics we&amp;#39;ve been looking at what</text>
  <text start="175.39" dur="2.97">has really been happening and we know</text>
  <text start="176.62" dur="5.01">this whole thing&amp;#39;s built on an illusion</text>
  <text start="178.36" dur="6.99">so does Trump sort of the Patriots but</text>
  <text start="181.63" dur="7.71">how do you bring down a system that</text>
  <text start="185.35" dur="6.63">doesn&amp;#39;t work well you drive it to the</text>
  <text start="189.34" dur="4.98">edge and you drive over the edge where</text>
  <text start="191.98" dur="3.72">it destroys itself and this is what we</text>
  <text start="194.32" dur="4.71">see happening right now which we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="195.7" dur="6.6">gonna be discussing in just a bit now we</text>
  <text start="199.03" dur="4.679">know that Obama&amp;#39;s health care bill a law</text>
  <text start="202.3" dur="5.189">that he put out there the Affordable</text>
  <text start="203.709" dur="6.841">Care Act or Obamacare it was never there</text>
  <text start="207.489" dur="4.981">to help the people actually what</text>
  <text start="210.55" dur="3.51">happened during this period of time a</text>
  <text start="212.47" dur="2.79">lot of the exchanges went completely</text>
  <text start="214.06" dur="2.94">bankrupt this had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="215.26" dur="4.34">Trump he was like wasn&amp;#39;t in office at</text>
  <text start="217" dur="5.16">this time a lot of people were hit with</text>
  <text start="219.6" dur="5.32">medical bills from their insurance</text>
  <text start="222.16" dur="4.71">company that were skyrocketing they</text>
  <text start="224.92" dur="4.83">couldn&amp;#39;t afford it and more money you</text>
  <text start="226.87" dur="5.16">put into the insurance payments you</text>
  <text start="229.75" dur="5.51">can&amp;#39;t put it into the economy and the</text>
  <text start="232.03" dur="7.44">question is why did they push so hard</text>
  <text start="235.26" dur="6.43">for this law why did they want it well</text>
  <text start="239.47" dur="4.829">if we go back to Q&amp;#39;s post it was to</text>
  <text start="241.69" dur="5.19">control the people think about it the</text>
  <text start="244.299" dur="4.801">majority of the people that are on the</text>
  <text start="246.88" dur="4.5">Affordable Care Act who get this</text>
  <text start="249.1" dur="6.389">insurance who love it they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="251.38" dur="6.06">subsidies from the government so they</text>
  <text start="255.489" dur="4.051">either pay zero or a little bit for the</text>
  <text start="257.44" dur="4.14">health insurance the rest comes from the</text>
  <text start="259.54" dur="5.22">government you are then dependent on the</text>
  <text start="261.58" dur="4.95">government the government grows but what</text>
  <text start="264.76" dur="3.54">are the report about the rest of the</text>
  <text start="266.53" dur="4.68">country what about those people that are</text>
  <text start="268.3" dur="4.95">self-employed those people where the</text>
  <text start="271.21" dur="4.11">employer says you know something we</text>
  <text start="273.25" dur="3.8">don&amp;#39;t have health insurance well they</text>
  <text start="275.32" dur="4.8">have to pay for it themselves and</text>
  <text start="277.05" dur="5.98">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people paying for it</text>
  <text start="280.12" dur="6.66">themselves and what they saw they saw</text>
  <text start="283.03" dur="5.88">their insurance premiums skyrocket now</text>
  <text start="286.78" dur="5.27">according to the law this was supposed</text>
  <text start="288.91" dur="5.58">to help people so they don&amp;#39;t go bankrupt</text>
  <text start="292.05" dur="5.32">you know when you get those big medical</text>
  <text start="294.49" dur="3.87">bills and you can&amp;#39;t pay them but guess</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="4.56">what</text>
  <text start="298.36" dur="7.29">is not helped at all and what we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="301.93" dur="6.09">here is that more Americans are going</text>
  <text start="305.65" dur="6.989">bankrupt under the affordable care act</text>
  <text start="308.02" dur="6.66">than ever before so a new study has</text>
  <text start="312.639" dur="4.071">found that about five hundred and thirty</text>
  <text start="314.68" dur="4.38">thousand families each year are</text>
  <text start="316.71" dur="4.6">financially ruined by medical bills and</text>
  <text start="319.06" dur="5.22">sicknesses and most of the families</text>
  <text start="321.31" dur="5.099">actually had health insurance so every</text>
  <text start="324.28" dur="4.349">year hundreds of thousands of American</text>
  <text start="326.409" dur="4.051">families find themselves facing huge</text>
  <text start="328.629" dur="3.51">medical bills that they did not expect</text>
  <text start="330.46" dur="3.929">to be paying and as a result</text>
  <text start="332.139" dur="4.5">minox medical expenses are the primary</text>
  <text start="334.389" dur="4.62">factor in sixty six point five percent</text>
  <text start="336.639" dur="5.881">of all personal bankruptcy filings in</text>
  <text start="339.009" dur="5.22">the United States but Obamacare was</text>
  <text start="342.52" dur="5.009">supposed to make things better where</text>
  <text start="344.229" dur="5.22">everyone had insurance that&amp;#39;s what we</text>
  <text start="347.529" dur="5.461">were told and also everyone can keep</text>
  <text start="349.449" dur="8.761">your doctor but this is not the case</text>
  <text start="352.99" dur="8.07">actually medical bankruptcy went up by</text>
  <text start="358.21" dur="6.69">two percent after Obamacare went into</text>
  <text start="361.06" dur="8.669">effect so this has not helped whatsoever</text>
  <text start="364.9" dur="6.87">and during this time many people still</text>
  <text start="369.729" dur="3.93">couldn&amp;#39;t get health insurance many</text>
  <text start="371.77" dur="4.35">people couldn&amp;#39;t afford health insurance</text>
  <text start="373.659" dur="4.771">and those people who are paying for</text>
  <text start="376.12" dur="4.5">health insurance their premiums</text>
  <text start="378.43" dur="5.37">continually went up and up and up and</text>
  <text start="380.62" dur="6.12">their deductibles got larger and larger</text>
  <text start="383.8" dur="5.339">and larger which really meant health</text>
  <text start="386.74" dur="4.199">insurance was not helping with their</text>
  <text start="389.139" dur="2.941">everyday bills and they couldn&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="390.939" dur="5.13">this money and put it back into the</text>
  <text start="392.08" dur="6.869">economy this was designed to hurt the</text>
  <text start="396.069" dur="5.16">American people not help the American</text>
  <text start="398.949" dur="4.981">people it was designed to enrich the</text>
  <text start="401.229" dur="5.071">insurance companies it was designed to</text>
  <text start="403.93" dur="4.65">make all those people that are coming</text>
  <text start="406.3" dur="3.69">into the country illegally and those</text>
  <text start="408.58" dur="3.839">people who are in the low-income bracket</text>
  <text start="409.99" dur="7.829">or low middle class income bracket to be</text>
  <text start="412.419" dur="8.22">dependent on the government and this has</text>
  <text start="417.819" dur="5.88">to change and it will change when the</text>
  <text start="420.639" dur="5.611">entire system is reset now like we said</text>
  <text start="423.699" dur="5.7">in the beginning this entire central</text>
  <text start="426.25" dur="4.709">bank economy can&amp;#39;t go anywhere</text>
  <text start="429.399" dur="2.801">it&amp;#39;s stuck normally they would have an</text>
  <text start="430.959" dur="3.641">event we mentioned this many times</text>
  <text start="432.2" dur="5.01">before and what we&amp;#39;re seeing and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="434.6" dur="4.59">seeing it in real time we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="437.21" dur="4.26">actual economy this is the central bank</text>
  <text start="439.19" dur="5.55">economy fall apart right in front of</text>
  <text start="441.47" dur="5.94">your eyes US retail sales they have</text>
  <text start="444.74" dur="6.57">collapsed in December this is the</text>
  <text start="447.41" dur="5.73">biggest drop in a decade and when you</text>
  <text start="451.31" dur="7.83">look at this this is the biggest drop</text>
  <text start="453.14" dur="8.64">since 2009 and why is this happening yes</text>
  <text start="459.14" dur="4.8">jobs are coming back but think about how</text>
  <text start="461.78" dur="3.84">many people have been unemployed think</text>
  <text start="463.94" dur="4.32">about how many people who have part-time</text>
  <text start="465.62" dur="5.94">jobs think about all the people that had</text>
  <text start="468.26" dur="5.28">a reduce their income because they lost</text>
  <text start="471.56" dur="4.86">our high paying job and they get a how</text>
  <text start="473.54" dur="5.34">to get a low paying job remember what</text>
  <text start="476.42" dur="4.08">Trump is doing right now with bringing</text>
  <text start="478.88" dur="5.82">businesses back bringing manufacturing</text>
  <text start="480.5" dur="8.1">back he&amp;#39;s preparing the country for the</text>

  <text start="492.62" dur="5.19">not his economy it&amp;#39;s the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="495.17" dur="3.99">economy they need to destroy it and why</text>
  <text start="497.81" dur="4.02">do they need to destroy it well think</text>
  <text start="499.16" dur="4.23">about it we have the debt which has</text>
  <text start="501.83" dur="3.45">reached 22 Trull and we know it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="503.39" dur="4.41">more than that we have all the unfunded</text>
  <text start="505.28" dur="4.86">liabilities and things like that but</text>
  <text start="507.8" dur="4.05">more interestingly is that interest</text>
  <text start="510.14" dur="5.01">rates are very very low</text>
  <text start="511.85" dur="5.129">and we know the debt is rising and the</text>
  <text start="515.15" dur="4.94">amount of tax receipts coming into the</text>
  <text start="516.979" dur="6.541">government well that&amp;#39;s shrinking in</text>
  <text start="520.09" dur="6.57">December the US Treasury brought in a</text>
  <text start="523.52" dur="5.57">total receipts of about 313 billion and</text>
  <text start="526.66" dur="7.27">771 billion for the fiscal year-to-date</text>
  <text start="529.09" dur="8.29">versus out leg outlays of only 326</text>
  <text start="533.93" dur="6.36">billion and 1.09 trillion for fiscal</text>
  <text start="537.38" dur="5.49">2019 resulting in a deficit of 14</text>
  <text start="540.29" dur="4.92">billion honestly worse than the 11</text>
  <text start="542.87" dur="4.86">billion deficit expected and better than</text>
  <text start="545.21" dur="6.06">the 2017 s December deficit of 23</text>
  <text start="547.73" dur="5.49">billion the not-so-good news is that for</text>
  <text start="551.27" dur="5.37">the fiscal year through December 31st</text>
  <text start="553.22" dur="6.23">the total US budget deficit was 319</text>

  <text start="565.91" dur="5.04">point one trillion and it just gets</text>
  <text start="568.79" dur="4.23">worse from here because when we look at</text>
  <text start="570.95" dur="4.29">total government receipts they were</text>
  <text start="573.02" dur="5.52">three point three three trillion this</text>
  <text start="575.24" dur="5.13">number was 0.4% lower than the three</text>

  <text start="580.37" dur="6.06">one year ago why is this important every</text>
  <text start="584" dur="4.59">time since Ellie&amp;#39;s 1970 when government</text>

  <text start="592.37" dur="4.53">in a recession and this is why the</text>
  <text start="594.17" dur="4.65">mainstream media this is why they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="596.9" dur="4.35">there pushing the idea that we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="598.82" dur="5.4">to be heading into a recession in 2020</text>
  <text start="601.25" dur="4.86">number one they know that this economy</text>
  <text start="604.22" dur="5.04">is fake</text>
  <text start="606.11" dur="6.6">it&amp;#39;s an illusion they also know that</text>
  <text start="609.26" dur="5.76">we&amp;#39;ve already been in a recession the</text>
  <text start="612.71" dur="5.82">only thing they didn&amp;#39;t count on was that</text>

  <text start="618.53" dur="5.19">keep the statistical information looking</text>
  <text start="620.72" dur="6.75">fantastic he&amp;#39;s using their weapons</text>
  <text start="623.72" dur="6.99">against them but Trump he doesn&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="627.47" dur="5.88">about optics he&amp;#39;s setting up a narrative</text>
  <text start="630.71" dur="5.36">he&amp;#39;s setting up something that he can</text>
  <text start="633.35" dur="6.39">use later on and what is that</text>
  <text start="636.07" dur="6.46">well he&amp;#39;s driving the economy to the</text>

  <text start="642.53" dur="5.4">raising the debt and doing as much as he</text>
  <text start="645.62" dur="5.52">possibly can with that money to bring</text>
