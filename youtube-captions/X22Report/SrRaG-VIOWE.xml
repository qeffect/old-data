  <text start="81.79" dur="6.43">political and geopolitical news now we</text>
  <text start="84.83" dur="5.16">know President Obama he wants the TPP</text>
  <text start="88.22" dur="3.509">and of course this was written and</text>
  <text start="89.99" dur="4.559">created by the corporation&amp;#39;s central</text>
  <text start="91.729" dur="4.231">bank&amp;#39;s and this is not a benefit to the</text>
  <text start="94.549" dur="3.36">people whatsoever actually it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="95.96" dur="4.159">make it worse for the people it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="97.909" dur="5.041">to make it worse for the United States</text>
  <text start="100.119" dur="5.131">but they don&amp;#39;t care about that as long</text>
  <text start="102.95" dur="4.94">as the corporations make their money</text>
  <text start="105.25" dur="4.96">profit is all they care about</text>
  <text start="107.89" dur="6.06">controlling the people is what they care</text>
  <text start="110.21" dur="6.449">about but very interestingly Obama</text>
  <text start="113.95" dur="5.739">decided to put Congress on notice now we</text>
  <text start="116.659" dur="6.151">know that Congress they&amp;#39;re on vacation</text>
  <text start="119.689" dur="4.981">until after Labor Day but the White</text>
  <text start="122.81" dur="4.379">House they decided to put Congress on</text>
  <text start="124.67" dur="5.18">notice this morning that will be sending</text>
  <text start="127.189" dur="6.211">lawmakers a bill to implement the</text>
  <text start="129.85" dur="6.06">trans-pacific partnership agreement now</text>
  <text start="133.4" dur="6.36">we know this was the old done in secret</text>
  <text start="135.91" dur="6.55">you have to pass it to read it and that</text>
  <text start="139.76" dur="4.77">should tell us right there and then this</text>
  <text start="142.46" dur="4.68">is not something we should do if</text>
  <text start="144.53" dur="5.22">anything needs to be secret if anything</text>
  <text start="147.14" dur="5.82">needs to be behind closed doors how</text>
  <text start="149.75" dur="6.24">possibly could it be for the people it</text>
  <text start="152.96" dur="5.1">isn&amp;#39;t just like we&amp;#39;ve seen everything</text>
  <text start="155.99" dur="4.41">else the Affordable Care Act is that</text>
  <text start="158.06" dur="5.19">really a benefit to the people the</text>
  <text start="160.4" dur="4.14">Patriot Act benefit to the people no and</text>
  <text start="163.25" dur="3.409">we can go on and on and on</text>
  <text start="164.54" dur="6.149">none of this is a benefit to the people</text>
  <text start="166.659" dur="7.42">its benefit to the US government it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="170.689" dur="7.44">benefit to the corporations it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="174.079" dur="6.601">benefit to the central bank and none of</text>
  <text start="178.129" dur="4.08">it is for the people they&amp;#39;re not working</text>
  <text start="180.68" dur="3.059">for the people anymore they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="182.209" dur="6">for the central bank&amp;#39;s the corporations</text>
  <text start="183.739" dur="6.03">and foreign governments now very</text>
  <text start="188.209" dur="6.15">interestingly the United States usually</text>
  <text start="189.769" dur="7.05">comes out with warnings of not to visit</text>
  <text start="194.359" dur="3.75">certain countries they come out with</text>
  <text start="196.819" dur="3.241">travel warning saying there could be</text>
  <text start="198.109" dur="3.69">fighting there which really means United</text>
  <text start="200.06" dur="3.45">States will be in that country pushing</text>
  <text start="201.799" dur="3.69">terrorism bringing in the soldiers and</text>
  <text start="203.51" dur="4.08">this is why they don&amp;#39;t want Americans in</text>
  <text start="205.489" dur="4.741">that area but what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="207.59" dur="6.63">there&amp;#39;s a lot of countries putting up</text>
  <text start="210.23" dur="10.05">travel warnings against coming to</text>
  <text start="214.22" dur="11.519">America for racism gun violence police</text>
  <text start="220.28" dur="8.7">shootings and the Zika virus and we can</text>
  <text start="225.739" dur="5.31">see right now that people are looking at</text>
  <text start="228.98" dur="4.56">the United States and they&amp;#39;re scratching</text>
  <text start="231.049" dur="7.05">their heads saying what happened to this</text>
  <text start="233.54" dur="7.169">country well what happened was we let a</text>
  <text start="238.099" dur="6.54">government grow too big we led a</text>
  <text start="240.709" dur="7.261">government control every aspect of our</text>
  <text start="244.639" dur="6.121">lives we let a government intertwine</text>
  <text start="247.97" dur="6.629">with corporations and central banks we</text>
  <text start="250.76" dur="7.379">let a government not to be accountable</text>
  <text start="254.599" dur="6.781">to the people and once we did all of</text>
  <text start="258.139" dur="6.361">this this government no longer works for</text>
  <text start="261.38" dur="7.65">the people the country turns into a</text>
  <text start="264.5" dur="9.389">fascist country where government and</text>
  <text start="269.03" dur="10.889">corporations meld into one and it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="273.889" dur="9.9">about controlling the people and this is</text>
  <text start="279.919" dur="6.151">what happened to America and we can see</text>
  <text start="283.789" dur="6.331">right now this was not the plan of the</text>
  <text start="286.07" dur="7.319">founding fathers the plan was to have a</text>
  <text start="290.12" dur="6.33">small government the executive branch</text>
  <text start="293.389" dur="4.74">they were secretaries we were supposed</text>
  <text start="296.45" dur="4.919">to have a job</text>
  <text start="298.129" dur="7.22">and then go back to your job after you</text>
  <text start="301.369" dur="8.03">donated your time to helping America</text>
  <text start="305.349" dur="7.53">it wasn&amp;#39;t about creating a job as a</text>
  <text start="309.399" dur="7.6">politician getting health benefits</text>
  <text start="312.879" dur="8.32">getting a retirement fund getting</text>
  <text start="316.999" dur="6.96">information for insider trading getting</text>
  <text start="321.199" dur="4.89">paid off by corporations being paid off</text>
  <text start="323.959" dur="4.86">by central banks being paid off by</text>
  <text start="326.089" dur="4.86">foreign governments this is not what</text>
  <text start="328.819" dur="7.8">they had in mind but this is what it all</text>
  <text start="330.949" dur="8.97">turned into now out in Ukraine we see</text>
  <text start="336.619" dur="4.491">Putin is out there and he said something</text>
  <text start="339.919" dur="4.5">very interesting</text>
  <text start="341.11" dur="6.279">it is obvious for all involved that the</text>
  <text start="344.419" dur="6.05">current Kiev authorities are not looking</text>
  <text start="347.389" dur="7.02">to solve problems through negotiation</text>
  <text start="350.469" dur="6.28">now they escalate to acts of terror this</text>
  <text start="354.409" dur="4.26">is very concerning he says the</text>
  <text start="356.749" dur="4.14">underlying situation is even more</text>
  <text start="358.669" dur="4.92">alarming trying to provoke violence and</text>
  <text start="360.889" dur="5.01">conflict can only serve to divert public</text>
  <text start="363.589" dur="5.61">attention from those who seized power in</text>
  <text start="365.899" dur="8.91">Kiev and still continue to usurp it and</text>
  <text start="369.199" dur="8.64">continue to rob their people so Russia</text>
  <text start="374.809" dur="5.16">and the rest of the world is looking at</text>
  <text start="377.839" dur="7.8">the situation and they know what is</text>
  <text start="379.969" dur="8.73">going on here Russia right now is not</text>
  <text start="385.639" dur="5.7">going to push for a war even though the</text>
  <text start="388.699" dur="6.03">corporate media is trying to convince</text>
  <text start="391.339" dur="5.79">everyone now Russia came out and they</text>
  <text start="394.729" dur="5.011">said they stopped this terrorist act in</text>
  <text start="397.129" dur="5.28">Crimea now the corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="399.74" dur="6.359">there and they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="402.409" dur="5.84">everyone that they&amp;#39;re bringing in troops</text>
  <text start="406.099" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re getting ready to do something</text>
  <text start="408.249" dur="7.18">they even deployed the s400 missile</text>
  <text start="411.139" dur="9.81">system to Crimea because of Russia</text>
  <text start="415.429" dur="8.66">getting prepared to attack Ukraine well</text>
  <text start="420.949" dur="6.24">this is furthest from the truth because</text>
  <text start="424.089" dur="5.44">we&amp;#39;ve been following this and this is</text>
  <text start="427.189" dur="4.381">why we do this so we have some type of</text>
  <text start="429.529" dur="8.271">record</text>
  <text start="431.57" dur="9.54">back in July of this year Russia already</text>
  <text start="437.8" dur="5.98">announced before anything before any of</text>
  <text start="441.11" dur="5.94">this even happen that they were going to</text>
  <text start="443.78" dur="7.38">be deploying the s400 missile system to</text>
  <text start="447.05" dur="6.08">Crimea in August they already told the</text>
  <text start="451.16" dur="6.54">world this is what they were doing</text>
  <text start="453.13" dur="8.62">Crimea is part of Russia and the s400</text>
  <text start="457.7" dur="7.47">missile system is a defense system but</text>
  <text start="461.75" dur="5.73">the corporate media is out there saying</text>
  <text start="465.17" dur="5.94">that they&amp;#39;re doing this because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="467.48" dur="6.96">getting ready to attack and this is not</text>
  <text start="471.11" dur="8.43">what is going on here now very</text>
  <text start="474.44" dur="8.82">interestingly US strategic bombers they</text>
  <text start="479.54" dur="8.1">are flying over the Arctic very close to</text>
  <text start="483.26" dur="6.99">the Russian border and the US Strategic</text>
  <text start="487.64" dur="5.34">Command confirmed that several b-52</text>
  <text start="490.25" dur="4.92">bombers had performed long-range drills</text>
  <text start="492.98" dur="4.41">over the North Pole Alaska into the</text>
  <text start="495.17" dur="9.18">North Sea where they skimmed along</text>
  <text start="497.39" dur="8.87">Russia&amp;#39;s maritime Arctic border now it</text>
  <text start="504.35" dur="5.55">just so happened that the u.s. bombers</text>
  <text start="506.26" dur="5.17">their trajectory coincided with areas</text>
  <text start="509.9" dur="4.26">where the Russian military has been</text>
  <text start="511.43" dur="7.56">engaged in defensive buildup in that</text>
  <text start="514.16" dur="7.35">area and we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="518.99" dur="4.31">Russian bombers came very close it looks</text>
  <text start="521.51" dur="3.99">like they were doing some reconnaissance</text>
  <text start="523.3" dur="8.77">trying to get some information on what</text>
  <text start="525.5" dur="9.75">is going on and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="532.07" dur="8.61">Bombers spent 20 hours in the air</text>
  <text start="535.25" dur="10.76">refueling 26 times using 15 kc-135s and</text>
  <text start="540.68" dur="9.12">10 kc-10 tankers to keep the planes</text>
  <text start="546.01" dur="8.55">flying so they can look at what was</text>
  <text start="549.8" dur="7.1">going on so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="554.56" dur="6.04">from all of this we seeing</text>
  <text start="556.9" dur="7.21">Ukraine heat up the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="560.6" dur="4.65">US government pushing provoking trying</text>
  <text start="564.11" dur="2.79">to get Russia to</text>
  <text start="565.25" dur="3.75">do something and if they don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="566.9" dur="5.28">something we&amp;#39;ll do it for them which is</text>
  <text start="569" dur="4.41">called a false flag and this is the</text>
  <text start="572.18" dur="5.42">direction we&amp;#39;re headed in</text>
  <text start="573.41" dur="6.21">it looks like China or Russia they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="577.6" dur="4.6">continually stepping back saying you</text>
  <text start="579.62" dur="6.18">know what we&amp;#39;re not doing this we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="582.2" dur="6.54">gonna provoke the United States we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="585.8" dur="5.03">not taking the bait we&amp;#39;re gonna do the</text>
  <text start="588.74" dur="4.2">opposite we&amp;#39;re gonna look for peace</text>
  <text start="590.83" dur="4.27">we&amp;#39;re gonna say let&amp;#39;s calm the situation</text>
  <text start="592.94" dur="3.63">down but the United States government</text>
  <text start="595.1" dur="4.1">central bankers they don&amp;#39;t want peace</text>
  <text start="596.57" dur="6.99">they don&amp;#39;t want the situation calm down</text>
  <text start="599.2" dur="7.06">they want things to escalate they want</text>
  <text start="603.56" dur="7.71">more and if these countries cannot give</text>
  <text start="606.26" dur="7.98">them more they will push them until the</text>
  <text start="611.27" dur="5.16">very end and if they do nothing the</text>
  <text start="614.24" dur="4.47">United States then will use a false flag</text>
  <text start="616.43" dur="4.05">and blame it on these countries and one</text>
  <text start="618.71" dur="3.69">of the easiest things for them to do is</text>
  <text start="620.48" dur="3.24">some type of cyberattack because the</text>
  <text start="622.4" dur="2.64">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="623.72" dur="3.57">and the corporate media just have to</text>
  <text start="625.04" dur="5.73">come out and say Russia just cyber</text>
  <text start="627.29" dur="6.57">attacked the financial system China just</text>
  <text start="630.77" dur="5.88">cyber attacked the infrastructure that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="633.86" dur="3.06">all they have to do and they can go with</text>
  <text start="636.65" dur="3.48">that</text>
  <text start="636.92" dur="5.669">they&amp;#39;ll need no proof and again with</text>
  <text start="640.13" dur="4.709">NATO and the United States any type of</text>
  <text start="642.589" dur="4.921">cyber attack is an act of war and they</text>
  <text start="644.839" dur="5.341">can start war at this point now out in</text>
  <text start="647.51" dur="5.7">Yemen we see the Houthi forces they are</text>
  <text start="650.18" dur="5.43">on the verge of a symbolic victory in</text>
  <text start="653.21" dur="5.52">the southern region of Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="655.61" dur="6.63">after launching a massive offensive near</text>
  <text start="658.73" dur="5.73">the border city of Nazareth over the</text>
  <text start="662.24" dur="5.52">last two weeks and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="664.46" dur="7.65">that Saudi Arabia they are being pushed</text>
  <text start="667.76" dur="7.59">further and further out of Yemen and the</text>
  <text start="672.11" dur="7.14">situation right now looks like the</text>
  <text start="675.35" dur="5.82">Houthis could be taken back the entire</text>
  <text start="679.25" dur="5.96">country and kicking out the puppet</text>
  <text start="681.17" dur="7.95">government and like I said before once</text>
  <text start="685.21" dur="6.34">the u.s. puppet governments in each one</text>
  <text start="689.12" dur="4.41">of these countries no longer exists this</text>
  <text start="691.55" dur="5.039">is going to be a major problem this is</text>
  <text start="693.53" dur="5.25">where the entire system will just</text>
  <text start="696.589" dur="4.051">collapse on its own</text>
  <text start="698.78" dur="3.3">and the central bank will have no way of</text>
  <text start="700.64" dur="3.12">stopping this whatsoever the US</text>
  <text start="702.08" dur="4.2">government will have no way of stopping</text>
  <text start="703.76" dur="4.89">us and what they&amp;#39;re trying to do right</text>
  <text start="706.28" dur="4.74">now is get this war started before any</text>
  <text start="708.65" dur="4.2">of this happens this is why this is all</text>
  <text start="711.02" dur="3.63">interconnected this is not like oh look</text>
  <text start="712.85" dur="2.43">we&amp;#39;re having war over here we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="714.65" dur="3.23">Yemen</text>
  <text start="715.28" dur="6.14">we&amp;#39;re in Libya Lebanon Iraq Syria and</text>
  <text start="717.88" dur="5.95">we&amp;#39;re in Ukraine and we&amp;#39;re you know</text>
  <text start="721.42" dur="4.15">provoking Russia and that&amp;#39;s separate and</text>
  <text start="723.83" dur="3.36">apart from what&amp;#39;s going on in the</text>
  <text start="725.57" dur="3.42">economy now all of this is</text>
  <text start="727.19" dur="4.89">interconnected the entire economy is</text>
  <text start="728.99" dur="6.21">supported by the petro dollar by keeping</text>
  <text start="732.08" dur="6.06">these areas controlled with a puppet</text>
  <text start="735.2" dur="5.85">government where the people do what the</text>

  <text start="758.21" dur="4.74">all of these countries and their</text>
  <text start="759.62" dur="4.68">reserves of all these countries and this</text>
  <text start="762.95" dur="3.15">is what they&amp;#39;re most worried about this</text>
  <text start="764.3" dur="4.53">is why we&amp;#39;re in the Middle East in the</text>
  <text start="766.1" dur="4.62">first place it&amp;#39;s not for freedom</text>
  <text start="768.83" dur="3.9">democracy and all that other stuff they</text>
  <text start="770.72" dur="3.81">tell you it&amp;#39;s not because of terrorism</text>
  <text start="772.73" dur="3.06">that was created by the United States</text>
  <text start="774.53" dur="4.17">government central bankers and the</text>
  <text start="775.79" dur="4.11">coalition forces to convince you yes</text>
  <text start="778.7" dur="2.61">this is why we&amp;#39;re in these countries</text>
  <text start="779.9" dur="4.17">think about how many times the stories</text>
  <text start="781.31" dur="4.65">have changed in Syria well we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="784.07" dur="4.53">Syria to get rid of the dictator oh</text>
  <text start="785.96" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re in Syria now to get the Islamic</text>
  <text start="788.6" dur="2.82">state because that first story wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="790.28" dur="3.15">working and we&amp;#39;re not getting any</text>
  <text start="791.42" dur="4.7">traction so they had to come up with</text>
  <text start="793.43" dur="5.31">something else now they&amp;#39;re in Syria</text>
  <text start="796.12" dur="8.8">because they&amp;#39;re trying to get rid of</text>
  <text start="798.74" dur="8.84">what well they&amp;#39;re trying to they have no</text>
  <text start="804.92" dur="5.4">story they just lost the narrative</text>
  <text start="807.58" dur="4.66">that&amp;#39;s the problem they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="810.32" dur="3.6">supposed to be in Syria it&amp;#39;s a sovereign</text>
  <text start="812.24" dur="5.67">country actually United States and the</text>
  <text start="813.92" dur="5.97">coalition forces invaded Syria but all</text>
  <text start="817.91" dur="5.28">of this is interconnected like I said</text>
  <text start="819.89" dur="5.01">before now we talked about Libya and</text>
  <text start="823.19" dur="3.27">we&amp;#39;re going to see that the United</text>
  <text start="824.9" dur="2.82">States government central bankers and</text>
  <text start="826.46" dur="6.25">the coalition forces they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="827.72" dur="7.51">intensify the bombings inside of Libya</text>
  <text start="832.71" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re gonna be heading out there right</text>
  <text start="835.23" dur="4.5">now Italy is denying that May we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="837.12" dur="6.33">have any special forces in Libya where I</text>
  <text start="839.73" dur="5.61">don&amp;#39;t see them but they do we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="843.45" dur="4.53">reports from all over the place that yes</text>
  <text start="845.34" dur="4.41">Italy has special forces and I noticed</text>
  <text start="847.98" dur="3.72">that all these countries pretend no we</text>
  <text start="849.75" dur="4.59">have no special forces until there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="851.7" dur="7.47">footage until there&amp;#39;s proof and they say</text>
  <text start="854.34" dur="6.8">oh we only have ten we only have 20 but</text>
  <text start="859.17" dur="5.6">we know there&amp;#39;s many more of these</text>
  <text start="861.14" dur="8.02">soldiers in each one of these countries</text>
  <text start="864.77" dur="5.74">governments love to lie now Turkey looks</text>
  <text start="869.16" dur="3.57">like they&amp;#39;re moving further and further</text>
  <text start="870.51" dur="3.57">away from the United States and closer</text>
  <text start="872.73" dur="3.09">and closer to Iran</text>
  <text start="874.08" dur="3.18">it looks like Turkey and Iran they have</text>
  <text start="875.82" dur="3.87">pledged greater cooperation</text>
  <text start="877.26" dur="4.71">I&amp;#39;m resolving the Syrian crisis and this</text>
  <text start="879.69" dur="4.14">is going to be a major problem for the</text>
  <text start="881.97" dur="5.85">United States and what we need to watch</text>
  <text start="883.83" dur="9.78">very very carefully as if turkey closes</text>
  <text start="887.82" dur="7.14">the border with Syria this is a game</text>
  <text start="893.61" dur="3.09">changer for the United States government</text>
  <text start="894.96" dur="4.44">central bankers so the United States</text>
  <text start="896.7" dur="6.32">government right now they&amp;#39;re running out</text>
  <text start="899.4" dur="6.09">of time the clock is ticking down and</text>
  <text start="903.02" dur="4.75">this is not a good situation whatsoever</text>
  <text start="905.49" dur="4.83">Russia right now is saying that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="907.77" dur="5.37">going to keep a permanent military base</text>
  <text start="910.32" dur="4.98">in Syria they&amp;#39;re not going to put</text>
  <text start="913.14" dur="3.78">nuclear weapons there but what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="915.3" dur="3.93">going to say is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="916.92" dur="5.88">maintain this base they will permanently</text>
  <text start="919.23" dur="4.74">be there and this is another problem for</text>
  <text start="922.8" dur="4.92">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="923.97" dur="8.67">bankers so like I said before time is</text>
  <text start="927.72" dur="6.03">ticking down which means one thing that</text>
  <text start="932.64" dur="3.27">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="933.75" dur="3.84">bankers they&amp;#39;re gonna be moving to plan</text>
  <text start="935.91" dur="6.42">whatever what plan they&amp;#39;re on right now</text>
  <text start="937.59" dur="7.83">and the last plan is the event because</text>
  <text start="942.33" dur="6.84">they have no alternative everything</text>
  <text start="945.42" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re trying to do is falling apart so</text>
  <text start="949.17" dur="7.08">all they have left is to create an event</text>
  <text start="951.57" dur="8.46">and can try to convince the world it is</text>
  <text start="956.25" dur="4.5">time to go to war now of course in the</text>
  <text start="960.03" dur="5.19">United States</text>
  <text start="960.75" dur="5.95">they&amp;#39;re trying to pretend or keep the</text>
  <text start="965.22" dur="2.95">illusion alive</text>
  <text start="966.7" dur="3.21">that they&amp;#39;re actually fighting the</text>
  <text start="968.17" dur="5.22">Islamic state and they&amp;#39;re actually doing</text>
  <text start="969.91" dur="5.94">a great job because we see that the US</text>
  <text start="973.39" dur="5.01">commander is out there trying to</text>
  <text start="975.85" dur="3.9">convince everyone that from all the</text>
  <text start="978.4" dur="3.39">bombings and everything United States</text>
  <text start="979.75" dur="4.41">has been doing the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="981.79" dur="7.05">fighters they&amp;#39;re on the run they&amp;#39;re down</text>
  <text start="984.16" dur="6.54">to 15,000 soldiers right now and their</text>
  <text start="988.84" dur="4.14">numbers are dropping very very quickly</text>
  <text start="990.7" dur="5.31">but they only started to drop when</text>
  <text start="992.98" dur="5.91">Russia actually stepped in the number of</text>
  <text start="996.01" dur="5.91">the Islamic state was growing for the</text>
  <text start="998.89" dur="4.41">entire year the United when the when the</text>
  <text start="1001.92" dur="5.31">United States and the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="1003.3" dur="6.27">were bombing in Iraq and Syria at the</text>
  <text start="1007.23" dur="3.84">point when Russia joined actually they</text>
  <text start="1009.57" dur="4.35">didn&amp;#39;t joined they came in and they</text>
  <text start="1011.07" dur="5.64">actually were bombing the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1013.92" dur="5.76">at that point the Islamic state numbers</text>
  <text start="1016.71" dur="5.61">dropped but the United States right now</text>
  <text start="1019.68" dur="4.29">has no alternative but to say yes we are</text>
  <text start="1022.32" dur="3.75">beating the Islamic state and again it</text>
  <text start="1023.97" dur="6.119">has nothing to do with the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1026.07" dur="6.33">whatsoever and what we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="1030.089" dur="5.511">because the US military they are</text>
  <text start="1032.4" dur="5.429">preparing new offenses in Syria and Iraq</text>
  <text start="1035.6" dur="5.89">they&amp;#39;re going to intensify the Air</text>
  <text start="1037.829" dur="7.141">Ground support and we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="1041.49" dur="6.12">entire Middle East light up right now it</text>
  <text start="1044.97" dur="6.42">is a complete disaster actually the</text>
  <text start="1047.61" dur="6.54">Pentagon will not reveal how many ground</text>
  <text start="1051.39" dur="4.65">troops we actually have in these</text>
  <text start="1054.15" dur="4.14">countries actually fighting the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1056.04" dur="8.28">state now they give us these bogus</text>
  <text start="1058.29" dur="8.76">numbers of like 3825 plus the 300 and</text>
  <text start="1064.32" dur="4.02">syria maybe it&amp;#39;s up to 42 you have to</text>
  <text start="1067.05" dur="3.3">remember they have an agreement with</text>
  <text start="1068.34" dur="5.85">Iraq where they can have about 4200</text>
  <text start="1070.35" dur="4.83">permanent soldiers inside of Iraq Syria</text>
  <text start="1074.19" dur="2.58">they&amp;#39;re not going to give the real</text>
  <text start="1075.18" dur="5.43">number because they&amp;#39;re not even supposed</text>
  <text start="1076.77" dur="5.78">to be in Syria they didn&amp;#39;t ask the</text>
  <text start="1080.61" dur="4.44">government permission they just invaded</text>
  <text start="1082.55" dur="3.82">but we have to remember the other trick</text>
  <text start="1085.05" dur="4.17">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="1086.37" dur="6.06">bankers use they bring in soldiers and</text>
  <text start="1089.22" dur="8.13">they call them temporary they like to</text>
  <text start="1092.43" dur="7.17">say temporary a lot and temporary they</text>
  <text start="1097.35" dur="3.09">can have as many as they want so</text>
  <text start="1099.6" dur="3.24">permanent</text>
  <text start="1100.44" dur="5.43">they have the 4000 or so temporary they</text>
  <text start="1102.84" dur="6.27">have about 10,000 and there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1105.87" dur="6.84">expiration but they don&amp;#39;t include that</text>
  <text start="1109.11" dur="5.6">in the count and this is how they trick</text>
  <text start="1112.71" dur="6.21">everyone no permanently no we only have</text>
  <text start="1114.71" dur="5.74">4200 that&amp;#39;s what we have there the other</text>
  <text start="1118.92" dur="3.03">is a temporary the other 10,000 are</text>
  <text start="1120.45" dur="4.44">there or temporary we don&amp;#39;t have an</text>
  <text start="1121.95" dur="6.51">expiration date these are the tricks</text>
  <text start="1124.89" dur="5.7">they play this is what they do so what</text>
  <text start="1128.46" dur="6.65">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is there are</text>
  <text start="1130.59" dur="8.28">three flash points for war Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1135.11" dur="6.55">Middle East and the Pacific which</text>
  <text start="1138.87" dur="4.95">includes North Korea and it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1141.66" dur="6.6">sitting atop a volcano that&amp;#39;s ready to</text>
  <text start="1143.82" dur="7.5">erupt and the clock is ticking we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="1148.26" dur="6.21">that point right now where the clock is</text>
  <text start="1151.32" dur="6.33">almost near zero the united states</text>
  <text start="1154.47" dur="9.96">government central bankers they have no</text>
  <text start="1157.65" dur="8.46">alternative but to create an event yes</text>
  <text start="1164.43" dur="4.65">can they go the route of peace and</text>
  <text start="1166.11" dur="5.61">ceasefire but where would that lead them</text>
  <text start="1169.08" dur="6.84">what would that give them that would</text>
  <text start="1171.72" dur="6.95">give them a petrol dollar that is</text>
  <text start="1175.92" dur="5.7">collapsing that would give them</text>
  <text start="1178.67" dur="6.1">countries in the Middle East abandoning</text>
  <text start="1181.62" dur="6.51">the dollar kicking the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1184.77" dur="7.92">out of their country the country selling</text>
  <text start="1188.13" dur="7.73">the oil using gold silver deewan ruble</text>
  <text start="1192.69" dur="5.99">or any other currency but the dollar</text>
  <text start="1195.86" dur="5.41">that would leave the United States</text>
  <text start="1198.68" dur="5.11">completely dead in the water collapsing</text>
  <text start="1201.27" dur="5.82">and everyone would point the finger at</text>
  <text start="1203.79" dur="7.83">the central bank so their only</text>
  <text start="1207.09" dur="7.85">alternative right now is to push this to</text>
  <text start="1211.62" dur="9.11">the next level to create that event</text>
  <text start="1214.94" dur="10.63">physical cyber to bring down the system</text>
  <text start="1220.73" dur="8.29">and we&amp;#39;re getting closer and closer to</text>
  <text start="1225.57" dur="6.69">that point just think about what the Fed</text>
  <text start="1229.02" dur="4.68">said think about what he said back in</text>
  <text start="1232.26" dur="3.51">2008</text>
