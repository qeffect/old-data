  <text start="94.2" dur="3.51">pay this at the end of the month now one</text>
  <text start="96.36" dur="3.03">of the reasons why they could make that</text>
  <text start="97.71" dur="2.97">payment first is there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="99.39" dur="4.79">completely broke they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="100.68" dur="6.2">funds secondly they received the</text>
  <text start="104.18" dur="5.29">agreement from the central banks and</text>
  <text start="106.88" dur="4.24">they could not go along with this</text>
  <text start="109.47" dur="5.22">whatsoever across many of their red</text>
  <text start="111.12" dur="6.42">lines including hiking taxes private is</text>
  <text start="114.69" dur="7.92">privatizing strategic assets cutting</text>

  <text start="122.61" dur="5.73">pensions for the poor and he looked at</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="3.42">this and the government looked at this</text>
  <text start="128.34" dur="5.729">and said no we cannot do this whatsoever</text>
  <text start="130.56" dur="5.34">if we push this agreement forward we</text>
  <text start="134.069" dur="4.651">would have riots on our hand that we</text>
  <text start="135.9" dur="7.22">could see right now that Greece is stuck</text>
  <text start="138.72" dur="7.11">they&amp;#39;re out of money out of time and</text>
  <text start="143.12" dur="4.089">they need to make some type of decision</text>
  <text start="145.83" dur="3.96">and of course they bought themselves on</text>
  <text start="147.209" dur="4.741">time by putting off this payment they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="149.79" dur="4.919">been talking to Russia and to the brick</text>
  <text start="151.95" dur="5.67">system and we see Greece is considering</text>
  <text start="154.709" dur="6.241">a membership in the bricks new</text>
  <text start="157.62" dur="6.27">Development Bank and EB this is coming</text>
  <text start="160.95" dur="5.19">from the Greek Deputy Defense Minister</text>
  <text start="163.89" dur="4.319">greece&amp;#39;s bilateral agreement with the</text>
  <text start="166.14" dur="3.6">BRICS countries has to do with what</text>
  <text start="168.209" dur="3.571">Greece and the BRICS countries are</text>
  <text start="169.74" dur="4.41">talking about on the question of</text>
  <text start="171.78" dur="4.62">development projects within Greece and</text>
  <text start="174.15" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re saying yeah this has nothing to</text>
  <text start="176.4" dur="6.23">do with their debt and things like that</text>
  <text start="178.47" dur="7.95">but of course as we know they need to</text>
  <text start="182.63" dur="6.4">create economic growth they need the</text>
  <text start="186.42" dur="5.37">funds they need to go someplace where</text>
  <text start="189.03" dur="6.99">their economy their country the people</text>
  <text start="191.79" dur="9.03">can grow and with the central bankers it</text>
  <text start="196.02" dur="8.16">cannot grow it will only contract with</text>
  <text start="200.82" dur="7.199">more debt and they realize this and they</text>
  <text start="204.18" dur="5.88">understand that there is no way the</text>
  <text start="208.019" dur="5.301">central bank is going to allow them to</text>
  <text start="210.06" dur="8.13">receive more funds without implementing</text>
  <text start="213.32" dur="7.449">cuts and Pensions austerity selling off</text>
  <text start="218.19" dur="4.71">more of their country so at this point</text>
  <text start="220.769" dur="5.011">in time it does look like Greece is</text>
  <text start="222.9" dur="6.72">going to move in a completely different</text>
  <text start="225.78" dur="5.97">direction now we understand the</text>
  <text start="229.62" dur="6.5">government is continually telling us</text>
  <text start="231.75" dur="8.79">that we don&amp;#39;t have privacy people love</text>
  <text start="236.12" dur="7.839">to be spied on they love giving away</text>
  <text start="240.54" dur="5.789">their information to get a discount for</text>
  <text start="243.959" dur="4.801">stores and we understand the government</text>
  <text start="246.329" dur="5.22">right now is trying to push cissa</text>
  <text start="248.76" dur="4.8">through and this will allow the</text>
  <text start="251.549" dur="4.141">company&amp;#39;s not to be liable for</text>
  <text start="253.56" dur="3.57">transferring your private information to</text>
  <text start="255.69" dur="3.269">the government because all the people</text>
  <text start="257.13" dur="3.359">are for this and they want this to</text>
  <text start="258.959" dur="3.601">happen to stop terrorism and the</text>
  <text start="260.489" dur="3.421">government needs to keep everyone safe</text>
  <text start="262.56" dur="5.1">but we know this is completely fake</text>
  <text start="263.91" dur="7.8">phony and false and it seems that all of</text>
  <text start="267.66" dur="8.759">this rhetoric coming out of the</text>
  <text start="271.71" dur="8.31">government is a lie about how the people</text>
  <text start="276.419" dur="6.421">want this and how the people love their</text>
  <text start="280.02" dur="5.49">information sold to different places and</text>
  <text start="282.84" dur="4.889">how the people are willing to give up</text>
  <text start="285.51" dur="5.37">their rights well it seems like a new</text>
  <text start="287.729" dur="5.31">report into US consumer attitudes to the</text>
  <text start="290.88" dur="4.05">collection of personal data has</text>
  <text start="293.039" dur="4.081">highlighted the disconnect between</text>
  <text start="294.93" dur="2.759">commercial claims that web users are</text>
  <text start="297.12" dur="3.329">happy</text>
  <text start="297.689" dur="6.24">trade privacy in exchange for benefits</text>
  <text start="300.449" dur="6.27">like discounts the report entitled the</text>
  <text start="303.929" dur="5.73">trade-off fallacy how marketers are</text>
  <text start="306.719" dur="5.33">misrepresenting American consumers and</text>
  <text start="309.659" dur="4.89">opening them up to exploitation is</text>
  <text start="312.049" dur="4.57">authored by three academics from the</text>
  <text start="314.549" dur="5.49">University of Pennsylvania and is based</text>
  <text start="316.619" dur="5.97">on a representative national cellphone</text>
  <text start="320.039" dur="6.51">and wireline phone survey of more than</text>
  <text start="322.589" dur="5.82">1,500 americans ages 18 or older these</text>
  <text start="326.549" dur="7.2">are the key findings on American</text>
  <text start="328.409" dur="7.82">consumers 91% disagree that if companies</text>
  <text start="333.749" dur="5.82">give me a discount it is fair to</text>
  <text start="336.229" dur="7.54">exchange my personal information without</text>
  <text start="339.569" dur="7.08">me knowing 71 percent disagree that it</text>
  <text start="343.769" dur="4.86">is fair for an online or physical store</text>
  <text start="346.649" dur="4.44">to monitor what I&amp;#39;m doing online when</text>
  <text start="348.629" dur="7.05">I&amp;#39;m there in exchange for letting me use</text>
  <text start="351.089" dur="8.4">the stores wireless internet fifty-five</text>
  <text start="355.679" dur="6.23">percent disagree that it&amp;#39;s okay if a</text>
  <text start="359.489" dur="5.25">store where I shop uses information it</text>
  <text start="361.909" dur="5.02">has about me to create a picture of me</text>
  <text start="364.739" dur="6.99">that improves the services they provide</text>
  <text start="366.929" dur="7.08">for me the report also flags up that</text>
  <text start="371.729" dur="5.58">large numbers of us consumers are</text>
  <text start="374.009" dur="6.51">unaware of how their purchase and usage</text>
  <text start="377.309" dur="4.86">data can be sold or shared with third</text>
  <text start="380.519" dur="4.591">parties without their permission or</text>
  <text start="382.169" dur="4.91">knowledge in many instances falsely</text>
  <text start="385.11" dur="4.5">believing they have greater data</text>
  <text start="387.079" dur="6.49">protection rights than they are in fact</text>
  <text start="389.61" dur="6.679">afforded by law one thing is clear the</text>
  <text start="393.569" dur="6.63">great lie about online privacy is</text>
  <text start="396.289" dur="6.97">unraveling we can see at this point in</text>
  <text start="400.199" dur="5.13">time people are not happy with this they</text>
  <text start="403.259" dur="4.68">don&amp;#39;t want companies to transfer their</text>
  <text start="405.329" dur="5.281">information and they don&amp;#39;t want it to be</text>
  <text start="407.939" dur="5.58">sold or given away they want their</text>
  <text start="410.61" dur="7.019">information to be private to stay</text>
  <text start="413.519" dur="6.54">private and of course the government no</text>
  <text start="417.629" dur="6.15">no we need your information don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="420.059" dur="5.491">we&amp;#39;ll protect it no they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="423.779" dur="3.45">protect it and there&amp;#39;s no reason why the</text>

  <text start="715.7" dur="10.44">and it did not get rid of Putin and we</text>
  <text start="722.36" dur="6">can see there&amp;#39;s tired of this it&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="726.14" dur="5.22">to take it to the next level and this is</text>
  <text start="728.36" dur="5.25">what they&amp;#39;re doing there are the</text>
  <text start="731.36" dur="4.79">Pentagon right now is drafting plans to</text>
  <text start="733.61" dur="5.4">deploy new stocks of military equipment</text>
  <text start="736.15" dur="5.98">like the new cruise missiles they want</text>
  <text start="739.01" dur="5.37">to put in Europe more military assets</text>
  <text start="742.13" dur="5.01">they want to ship in more soldiers they</text>
  <text start="744.38" dur="5.16">want to position they are preparing</text>
  <text start="747.14" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re getting ready and it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="749.54" dur="4.49">closer and closer to that time period</text>
  <text start="751.52" dur="7.38">where all hell is going to break loose</text>
  <text start="754.03" dur="8.17">we see in the Middle East the Yemeni</text>
  <text start="758.9" dur="6.96">people the Houthi said yes we will go</text>
  <text start="762.2" dur="8.07">and talk we agree that we need to have a</text>
  <text start="765.86" dur="7.38">peaceful solution and while the peaceful</text>
  <text start="770.27" dur="5.58">solution is being talked about Saudi</text>
  <text start="773.24" dur="6.96">Arabia is out there pushing propaganda</text>
  <text start="775.85" dur="7.02">that Yemen fired one scud missile into</text>
  <text start="780.2" dur="5.61">Saudi Arabia now again what would be the</text>
  <text start="782.87" dur="5.37">motivation the Houthi said listen we</text>
  <text start="785.81" dur="6.08">want peace talks why would they shoot</text>
  <text start="788.24" dur="7.88">one scud missile it wouldn&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="791.89" dur="7.09">actually it would make it worse for them</text>
  <text start="796.12" dur="5.68">so we can see right now this is</text>
  <text start="798.98" dur="6.24">definitely a false flag event they</text>
  <text start="801.8" dur="5.79">wanted this to this missile to be fired</text>
  <text start="805.22" dur="4.56">into Saudi Arabia for one it was</text>
  <text start="807.59" dur="5.13">intercepted supposedly allegedly by the</text>
  <text start="809.78" dur="4.35">Patriot missile system who knows it</text>
  <text start="812.72" dur="4.41">could have just went off someplace and</text>
  <text start="814.13" dur="5.31">just broke apart and exploded in the</text>
  <text start="817.13" dur="3.96">desert somewhere but they would like to</text>
  <text start="819.44" dur="4.67">bring in more military assets and the</text>
  <text start="821.09" dur="5.999">other is to maybe bring in ground troops</text>
  <text start="824.11" dur="5.53">to make the case of ah they are</text>
  <text start="827.089" dur="3.341">attacking us in our country it is time</text>
  <text start="829.64" dur="3.31">to</text>
  <text start="830.43" dur="8.34">take it to the next step and it seems</text>
  <text start="832.95" dur="7.74">this is where they are headed now we see</text>
  <text start="838.77" dur="3.629">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="840.69" dur="3.27">bankers are continually out there</text>
  <text start="842.399" dur="3.891">telling us that the Islamic state is in</text>
  <text start="843.96" dur="9.24">all the countries they need to get into</text>
  <text start="846.29" dur="9.07">Libya Lebanon Yemen Iraq Syria strange</text>
  <text start="853.2" dur="4.86">how they always the Islamic say just</text>
  <text start="855.36" dur="5.16">goes into those countries the US needs</text>
  <text start="858.06" dur="4.29">to get into and they the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="860.52" dur="5.069">is in those countries where they need to</text>
  <text start="862.35" dur="6.03">get into how convenient because we know</text>
  <text start="865.589" dur="5.551">this is a proxy army for the us-israel</text>
  <text start="868.38" dur="3.93">UK and other countries and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="871.14" dur="2.97">trying to convince us that the Islamic</text>
  <text start="872.31" dur="5.46">state has now captured another town in</text>
  <text start="874.11" dur="5.34">Libya they are building the case all of</text>
  <text start="877.77" dur="4.17">this is propaganda building it up</text>
  <text start="879.45" dur="4.92">building it up so they can go into these</text>
  <text start="881.94" dur="3.93">countries and restore the puppet regimes</text>
  <text start="884.37" dur="3.45">in each one of these countries and as we</text>
  <text start="885.87" dur="3.96">know in Libya they moved the central</text>
  <text start="887.82" dur="4.35">bank out of Tripoli because they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="889.83" dur="5.16">want it to fall into the hands of the</text>
  <text start="892.17" dur="4.35">people so they protected the central</text>
  <text start="894.99" dur="4.92">bank and they moved it to a different</text>
  <text start="896.52" dur="5.4">area Obama is out there in his</text>
  <text start="899.91" dur="5.31">ministrations making the claim that they</text>
  <text start="901.92" dur="6.69">have bombed and killed 10,000 Islamic</text>
  <text start="905.22" dur="6.77">state soldiers but guess what they</text>
  <text start="908.61" dur="8.04">cannot back up the claims whatsoever</text>
  <text start="911.99" dur="8.65">pure propaganda why would they bomb</text>
  <text start="916.65" dur="6.03">their own proxy army it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="920.64" dur="3.48">but they had to do something because all</text>
  <text start="922.68" dur="4.44">the reports that are coming out there</text>
  <text start="924.12" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re saying that the u.s. created the</text>
  <text start="927.12" dur="5.46">Islamic state along with Israel UK</text>
  <text start="929.13" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re all involved in this to push</text>
  <text start="932.58" dur="4.379">their agenda and now they&amp;#39;re against the</text>
  <text start="934.89" dur="4.92">wall and they&amp;#39;re trying to blame it on</text>
  <text start="936.959" dur="5.491">Assad they had to come out with oh we</text>
  <text start="939.81" dur="4.89">killed 10,000 of them just like they you</text>
  <text start="942.45" dur="6.329">know killed Osama bin Laden and then</text>
  <text start="944.7" dur="5.94">dumped his body off out at sea these are</text>
  <text start="948.779" dur="5.361">all lies and propaganda to make you</text>
  <text start="950.64" dur="6.96">believe that this is what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="954.14" dur="7.42">so we can see at this point in time they</text>
  <text start="957.6" dur="5.34">are making their move to go after Assad</text>
  <text start="961.56" dur="2.47">and they&amp;#39;re trying to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="962.94" dur="4.78">that is</text>
  <text start="964.03" dur="8.3">state was not created by the United</text>
  <text start="967.72" dur="8.87">States but it&amp;#39;s failing it&amp;#39;s not working</text>
  <text start="972.33" dur="7.24">we see the IMF now is going to hand Iraq</text>
  <text start="976.59" dur="5.86">830 million dollars worth of mergency</text>
  <text start="979.57" dur="4.56">funding to help the battle against the</text>
  <text start="982.45" dur="4.14">Islamic state actually they&amp;#39;re just put</text>
  <text start="984.13" dur="4.83">in the company the country more internet</text>
  <text start="986.59" dur="4.11">they do this to every single country if</text>
  <text start="988.96" dur="4.11">you notice every single country the</text>
  <text start="990.7" dur="3.81">United States has gone in to replace the</text>
  <text start="993.07" dur="3.47">elected government put in a puppet</text>
  <text start="994.51" dur="6.63">govern all these countries are in debt</text>
  <text start="996.54" dur="6.37">they&amp;#39;re in collapse and the central</text>
  <text start="1001.14" dur="4.89">bankers just keep on giving them more</text>
  <text start="1002.91" dur="5.94">and more debt to fight these wars that</text>
  <text start="1006.03" dur="7.02">the United States has started that</text>
  <text start="1008.85" dur="7.38">they&amp;#39;re continuing on with and this is</text>
  <text start="1013.05" dur="5.97">all part of their plan we see the</text>
  <text start="1016.23" dur="5.67">Pentagon quietly starts massive new arms</text>
  <text start="1019.02" dur="5.55">deliveries to Iraq these new arms are</text>
  <text start="1021.9" dur="3.87">going to be shipped off into Syria</text>
  <text start="1024.57" dur="4.38">because they&amp;#39;re getting ready for a</text>
  <text start="1025.77" dur="5.22">major offensive against Assad this is</text>
  <text start="1028.95" dur="4.98">why they&amp;#39;ve been using the propaganda to</text>
  <text start="1030.99" dur="5.13">convince you Assad and the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1033.93" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re working together because the</text>
  <text start="1036.12" dur="5.25">authorization for war allows the United</text>
  <text start="1039.39" dur="4.8">States to go after those countries that</text>
  <text start="1041.37" dur="4.95">the Islamic state is in and it will make</text>
  <text start="1044.19" dur="3.87">it easier for them to remove Assad</text>
  <text start="1046.32" dur="3.84">because they can say he was working with</text>
  <text start="1048.06" dur="5.88">them he&amp;#39;s a terrorist this makes it a</text>
  <text start="1050.16" dur="7.02">perfect plan for the United States and</text>
  <text start="1053.94" dur="6.29">this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do so all</text>
  <text start="1057.18" dur="7.26">these new weapons the shipments of this</text>
  <text start="1060.23" dur="7.51">1.6 billion dollar fund is all going to</text>
  <text start="1064.44" dur="6.03">be siphoned into Syria for this major</text>
  <text start="1067.74" dur="6.17">major offensive and now we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1070.47" dur="6.77">reports from Australia from Julie Bishop</text>
  <text start="1073.91" dur="5.83">saying that the Islamic state has the</text>
  <text start="1077.24" dur="4.87">capability to build chemical weapons and</text>
  <text start="1079.74" dur="4.61">there have been several reports of the</text>
  <text start="1082.11" dur="7.5">Islamic state using chlorine gas in</text>
  <text start="1084.35" dur="8.44">Syria yes we know this of course they</text>
  <text start="1089.61" dur="5.19">tried to blame that on Assad but the</text>
  <text start="1092.79" dur="4.77">Islamic state which is the proxy army</text>
  <text start="1094.8" dur="7.11">for United States government Israel</text>
  <text start="1097.56" dur="7.79">UK they have been given chlorine weapons</text>
  <text start="1101.91" dur="6.69">they are the ones who are using it and</text>
  <text start="1105.35" dur="5.23">the prohibition of chemical weapons the</text>
  <text start="1108.6" dur="3.69">chemical weapons watchdog conducted a</text>
  <text start="1110.58" dur="3.84">fact-finding mission in neighboring</text>
  <text start="1112.29" dur="3.81">Syria last year where the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1114.42" dur="5.39">has been fighting against Assad and</text>
  <text start="1116.1" dur="6.93">according to the OPCW chlorine was used</text>
  <text start="1119.81" dur="6.58">systematically and repeatedly in Syria</text>
  <text start="1123.03" dur="6.6">and who has the chlorine weapons the</text>
  <text start="1126.39" dur="6.27">Islamic state it&amp;#39;s the same thing we</text>
  <text start="1129.63" dur="6.24">heard when sarin gas was used in Syria</text>
  <text start="1132.66" dur="7.62">the Free Syrian Army was caught with a</text>
  <text start="1135.87" dur="7.13">cave full of sarin gas why would a</text>
  <text start="1140.28" dur="7.11">leader who is fighting for his country</text>
  <text start="1143" dur="6.15">use chemical weapons on his own people</text>
  <text start="1147.39" dur="4.46">this would be like George Washington</text>
  <text start="1149.15" dur="6.52">fighting for the people of United States</text>
  <text start="1151.85" dur="6.15">to use chemical weapons on the people in</text>
  <text start="1155.67" dur="6.23">the United States it would make no sense</text>
  <text start="1158" dur="7.75">so we can see at this point in time</text>
  <text start="1161.9" dur="7.24">Assad would want the backing of his</text>
  <text start="1165.75" dur="6.27">people the backing of his forces to help</text>
  <text start="1169.14" dur="5.7">fight the free syrian army to help fight</text>
  <text start="1172.02" dur="5.7">the Islamic state to push out the</text>
  <text start="1174.84" dur="6.48">invaders of that the invaders that are</text>
  <text start="1177.72" dur="5.58">invading his country the stories the</text>
  <text start="1181.32" dur="4.92">United States is pushing out there in</text>
  <text start="1183.3" dur="5.46">the corporate media don&amp;#39;t even make</text>
  <text start="1186.24" dur="7.71">sense so we can see what&amp;#39;s coming right</text>
  <text start="1188.76" dur="7.71">now we can see a major offensive in</text>
  <text start="1193.95" dur="4.83">Syria is coming we see a major offensive</text>
  <text start="1196.47" dur="4.2">coming in Ukraine now we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1198.78" dur="4.11">have to watch these watch the indicators</text>
  <text start="1200.67" dur="4.44">because again as we know things can</text>
  <text start="1202.89" dur="5.06">change but right now it seems like we</text>
  <text start="1205.11" dur="4.83">are directly on path for this to happen</text>
