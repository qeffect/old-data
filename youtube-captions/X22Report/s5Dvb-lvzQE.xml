  <text start="167.41" dur="4.44">former top official and president</text>
  <text start="169.06" dur="5.01">Trump&amp;#39;s campaign now the move was part</text>
  <text start="171.85" dur="4.109">of gates agreement to plead guilty to</text>
  <text start="174.07" dur="5.699">conspiracy to defraud the United States</text>
  <text start="175.959" dur="5.431">and lying to the FBI now as part of the</text>
  <text start="179.769" dur="3.451">play gates agreed to cooperate with a</text>
  <text start="181.39" dur="4.65">special counsel on robert Mueller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="183.22" dur="3.76">probe we brought regarding any all and</text>
  <text start="186.04" dur="3.55">all matters</text>
  <text start="186.98" dur="4.259">relevant to his vestigation under the</text>
  <text start="189.59" dur="3.27">terms of the plea agreement the</text>
  <text start="191.239" dur="3.151">government agreed that it would move</text>
  <text start="192.86" dur="3.57">promptly to dismiss without prejudice</text>
  <text start="194.39" dur="4.679">the charges brought against gates in the</text>
  <text start="196.43" dur="5.19">Eastern District of Virginia and gates</text>
  <text start="199.069" dur="4.17">waives venue as to such charges in the</text>
  <text start="201.62" dur="4.679">event he breaches the agreement and we</text>
  <text start="203.239" dur="6.36">could see right now that if they truly</text>
  <text start="206.299" dur="7.111">really had something on him with these</text>
  <text start="209.599" dur="7.051">22 tax and bank fraud charges they would</text>
  <text start="213.41" dur="5.45">have gone with it I mean why did he why</text>
  <text start="216.65" dur="4.619">did he make this deal he he would have</text>
  <text start="218.86" dur="5.14">taken this and this would have been</text>
  <text start="221.269" dur="4.981">plastered all over the corporate media</text>
  <text start="224" dur="5.43">all over the place to show look we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="226.25" dur="5.489">done something amazing here but I think</text>
  <text start="229.43" dur="6.119">what happened was they really don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="231.739" dur="8.661">anything and it looks like they decided</text>
  <text start="235.549" dur="7.291">to make this deal now again the deal is</text>
  <text start="240.4" dur="6.429">conspiracy to defraud the United States</text>
  <text start="242.84" dur="7.2">and lying to the FBI how many times has</text>
  <text start="246.829" dur="5.91">the FBI lied to the American people how</text>
  <text start="250.04" dur="5.16">many times has the FBI deceived the</text>
  <text start="252.739" dur="4.711">American people I mean think about this</text>
  <text start="255.2" dur="5.399">now one of the reasons why this might be</text>
  <text start="257.45" dur="6.779">happening at this point and you know</text>
  <text start="260.599" dur="7.201">Muller was pushing the idea of you know</text>
  <text start="264.229" dur="6.421">the 13 indictments and going after man</text>
  <text start="267.8" dur="5.66">afford about him lying and laundering</text>
  <text start="270.65" dur="5.82">money and continuing on and on and on is</text>
  <text start="273.46" dur="5.44">because sessions came out and he</text>
  <text start="276.47" dur="4.23">announced yesterday afternoon that the</text>
  <text start="278.9" dur="4.62">Department of Justice would investigate</text>
  <text start="280.7" dur="5.46">potential abuses of FISA now Trump came</text>
  <text start="283.52" dur="7.769">out and they&amp;#39;re saying that you know he</text>
  <text start="286.16" dur="8.28">was tweeting and he was saying that he</text>
  <text start="291.289" dur="5.511">is an Obama guy and we need to</text>
  <text start="294.44" dur="7.34">investigate we move we need to move</text>
  <text start="296.8" dur="8.29">faster now the question is was he</text>
  <text start="301.78" dur="8.29">putting on a show was he pushing</text>
  <text start="305.09" dur="8.34">sessions to move quickly on this and was</text>
  <text start="310.07" dur="7.74">this all being done on purpose now again</text>
  <text start="313.43" dur="6.91">I really do wish that they would move</text>
  <text start="317.81" dur="4.9">forward on all of this because there</text>
  <text start="320.34" dur="3.78">is a lot of criminality there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="322.71" dur="3.42">questions a lot more than Russian</text>
  <text start="324.12" dur="3.269">collusion or anything else like that but</text>
  <text start="326.13" dur="2.91">we do have a special counsel for that</text>
  <text start="327.389" dur="4.651">the Department of Justice should be</text>
  <text start="329.04" dur="5.28">looking into all of these things and we</text>
  <text start="332.04" dur="4.08">can see right now Trump you know as</text>
  <text start="334.32" dur="3.99">president can&amp;#39;t do this the Department</text>
  <text start="336.12" dur="3.78">of Justice has to do this and sessions</text>
  <text start="338.31" dur="3.3">did come out and he defended his</text>
  <text start="339.9" dur="3.9">handling of the FISA investigation by</text>
  <text start="341.61" dur="3.839">saying he followed the appropriate</text>
  <text start="343.8" dur="3.75">process by ordering the IG to</text>
  <text start="345.449" dur="3.69">investigate and that as long as he</text>
  <text start="347.55" dur="3.839">remains Attorney General he will</text>
  <text start="349.139" dur="6.181">continue to discharge my duties with</text>
  <text start="351.389" dur="5.701">integrity and honor now of course we</text>
  <text start="355.32" dur="3.87">need to understand that the Senate</text>
  <text start="357.09" dur="5.46">Republicans have said they will not</text>
  <text start="359.19" dur="7.65">confirm another AG nominee if sessions</text>
  <text start="362.55" dur="6.929">is forced out now once again we need to</text>
  <text start="366.84" dur="4.44">look at what is going on here we know</text>
  <text start="369.479" dur="3.721">there&amp;#39;s a lot of tweets going on we know</text>
  <text start="371.28" dur="3.21">a lot of this is happening and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="373.2" dur="3.6">heard this before where they said Oh</text>
  <text start="374.49" dur="6.02">Trump is getting ready to fire sessions</text>
  <text start="376.8" dur="6.21">Trump is getting ready to you know fire</text>
  <text start="380.51" dur="7.42">different people and it never really</text>
  <text start="383.01" dur="9.719">happened this most likely is a show to</text>
  <text start="387.93" dur="7.919">push the Department of Justice into a</text>
  <text start="392.729" dur="5.881">full investigation of what happened I</text>
  <text start="395.849" dur="4.921">don&amp;#39;t think we need any more time here I</text>
  <text start="398.61" dur="4.739">think we need to move forward with this</text>
  <text start="400.77" dur="5.31">I think the indictments need to flow I</text>
  <text start="403.349" dur="5.101">think the subpoenas need to flow and I</text>
  <text start="406.08" dur="5.79">think at this point in time Trump has</text>
  <text start="408.45" dur="5.6">been in office for a year we can see</text>
  <text start="411.87" dur="4.979">we&amp;#39;re coming up to the midterm elections</text>
  <text start="414.05" dur="6.19">he doesn&amp;#39;t have that much time left and</text>
  <text start="416.849" dur="5.491">if he doesn&amp;#39;t do something now nothing</text>
  <text start="420.24" dur="5.01">is going to be done and I think at this</text>
  <text start="422.34" dur="4.17">point they must have enough evidence</text>
  <text start="425.25" dur="3.03">from all the investigations that have</text>
  <text start="426.51" dur="4.77">been going on where they can start</text>
  <text start="428.28" dur="5.85">bringing charges to these certain</text>
  <text start="431.28" dur="5.13">individuals and I think this is the time</text>
  <text start="434.13" dur="4.5">because if he goes any further than this</text>
  <text start="436.41" dur="5.43">and we end up in the summer in the fall</text>
  <text start="438.63" dur="5.19">with nothing happening nothing is going</text>
  <text start="441.84" dur="4.32">to happen because he&amp;#39;s gonna run out of</text>
  <text start="443.82" dur="5.13">time and eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="446.16" dur="5.97">happen is the presidential elections</text>
  <text start="448.95" dur="5.23">will come up and once again we&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="452.13" dur="5.28">back where we started</text>
  <text start="454.18" dur="6.38">now in Afghanistan we see that</text>
  <text start="457.41" dur="6.97">Afghanistan&amp;#39;s president Ghani has</text>
  <text start="460.56" dur="5.979">offered to recognize the Taliban as a</text>
  <text start="464.38" dur="3.99">legitimate actor in the country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="466.539" dur="5.281">politics very interesting this is a</text>
  <text start="468.37" dur="4.41">major shift where before they were</text>
  <text start="471.82" dur="3.379">saying they were a terrorist</text>
  <text start="472.78" dur="8">organization but now all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="475.199" dur="8.981">they want peace why because of tapi tapi</text>
  <text start="480.78" dur="6.759">this is made up of Turkmenistan</text>
  <text start="484.18" dur="6.45">Afghanistan Pakistan India it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="487.539" dur="5.641">pipeline and we see the US has invested</text>
  <text start="490.63" dur="4.56">about eight billion dollars it was</text>
  <text start="493.18" dur="4.44">officially inaugurated on Friday and</text>
  <text start="495.19" dur="5.099">when you look at the entire situation</text>
  <text start="497.62" dur="4.769">the President of Afghanistan said the</text>
  <text start="500.289" dur="4.771">tapi simply cannot exist without the</text>
  <text start="502.389" dur="5.041">Taliban approval now all the above is</text>
  <text start="505.06" dur="5.19">code for the Taliban getting their cut</text>
  <text start="507.43" dur="6.06">remember they control a large portion of</text>
  <text start="510.25" dur="5.339">Afghanistan and we can see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="513.49" dur="3.989">going to get a cut from this so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="515.589" dur="6.57">bringing them into the political process</text>
  <text start="517.479" dur="8.55">and again this entire war out in</text>
  <text start="522.159" dur="6.241">Afghanistan was about pipelines it was</text>
  <text start="526.029" dur="5.011">about controlling the resources it was</text>
  <text start="528.4" dur="4.68">about keeping the country in chaos it</text>
  <text start="531.04" dur="4.47">was controlling the poppy fields and</text>
  <text start="533.08" dur="4.11">having them flourish so they can use it</text>
  <text start="535.51" dur="6.269">for drug trade to pay for covert</text>
  <text start="537.19" dur="7.23">operations and now we see everything</text>
  <text start="541.779" dur="6.661">being turned around where the Taliban</text>
  <text start="544.42" dur="5.91">right now is actually going to have a</text>
  <text start="548.44" dur="6.48">political spot in the Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="550.33" dur="8.009">government and at this point Russia</text>
  <text start="554.92" dur="5.57">China they&amp;#39;ve been calling for peace</text>
  <text start="558.339" dur="4.801">they want the Taliban and the Afghan</text>
  <text start="560.49" dur="4.53">government to sit down and work this out</text>
  <text start="563.14" dur="5.189">and it looks like this is actually</text>
  <text start="565.02" dur="6.34">happening we see right now out in Syria</text>
  <text start="568.329" dur="5.311">Turkey is rejecting the US French calls</text>
  <text start="571.36" dur="4.5">to suspend the offensive in Northwest</text>
  <text start="573.64" dur="4.65">and Syria the reason for this is because</text>
  <text start="575.86" dur="4.2">they realize this is going to push out</text>
  <text start="578.29" dur="5.06">the deep state and they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="580.06" dur="6.81">to happen and once again</text>
  <text start="583.35" dur="4.45">turkey is saying that those you know</text>
  <text start="586.87" dur="3.12">individual</text>
  <text start="587.8" dur="4.71">living in the Kurd region those are</text>
  <text start="589.99" dur="6.599">terrorists and terrorists don&amp;#39;t fall</text>
  <text start="592.51" dur="6.54">under the UN peace deal now once again</text>
  <text start="596.589" dur="5.331">we can see that the deep state they are</text>
  <text start="599.05" dur="6.27">pushing their agenda very very hard here</text>
  <text start="601.92" dur="5.26">we see that the New York Times and other</text>
  <text start="605.32" dur="5.49">corporate media outlets are out there</text>
  <text start="607.18" dur="8.45">they are saying that North Korea has</text>
  <text start="610.81" dur="7.8">supplied Syria with chemical weapons and</text>
  <text start="615.63" dur="7.3">they&amp;#39;re making the connection between</text>
  <text start="618.61" dur="6.27">North Korea and Syria right now now what</text>
  <text start="622.93" dur="4.8">are they basing this on well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="624.88" dur="6.84">saying that they intercepted on January</text>
  <text start="627.73" dur="7.07">2017 two ships carrying acid resistant</text>
  <text start="631.72" dur="6.989">tiles from North Korea to Syria and</text>
  <text start="634.8" dur="9.01">they&amp;#39;re saying that these tiles well</text>
  <text start="638.709" dur="9.541">they&amp;#39;re used to construct chemical</text>
  <text start="643.81" dur="6.779">weapon factories I mean what the tile is</text>
  <text start="648.25" dur="5.04">exclusively made and utilized for this</text>
  <text start="650.589" dur="5.851">purpose I mean they&amp;#39;re really going out</text>
  <text start="653.29" dur="6.39">on a limb here and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="656.44" dur="6.139">that they have no proof they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="659.68" dur="6.24">this came from a UN leaked document and</text>
  <text start="662.579" dur="5.891">a lot of it sounds like propaganda once</text>
  <text start="665.92" dur="5.55">again so let&amp;#39;s think about this for a</text>
  <text start="668.47" dur="5.3">second they&amp;#39;re saying that North Korea</text>
  <text start="671.47" dur="6.179">was sending these tiles to create</text>
  <text start="673.77" dur="7.33">factories to build chemical weapons but</text>
  <text start="677.649" dur="5.491">the UN came in and inspected Syria</text>
  <text start="681.1" dur="4.739">saying they got rid of all the chemical</text>
  <text start="683.14" dur="4.139">weapons actually the US Russia and China</text>
  <text start="685.839" dur="4.351">and many other countries signed off on</text>
  <text start="687.279" dur="5.101">this and North Korea is then sending</text>
  <text start="690.19" dur="5.13">them tiles to create and build factories</text>
  <text start="692.38" dur="5.67">to create chemical weapons so where did</text>
  <text start="695.32" dur="4.379">they get the chemicals and how fast did</text>
  <text start="698.05" dur="2.82">they build these factories I mean listen</text>
  <text start="699.699" dur="4.021">the militants</text>
  <text start="700.87" dur="4.8">they have the ability to create chemical</text>
  <text start="703.72" dur="4.08">weapons right on site and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="705.67" dur="4.62">need all these tiles and all this other</text>
  <text start="707.8" dur="5.969">stuff they&amp;#39;re doing it in these little</text>
  <text start="710.29" dur="6.72">areas and it&amp;#39;s being supplied by the</text>
  <text start="713.769" dur="6.18">deep State this whole thing is being</text>
