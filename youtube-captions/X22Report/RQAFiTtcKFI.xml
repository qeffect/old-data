  <text start="124.31" dur="4.559">been tracking this economy over time</text>
  <text start="126.619" dur="3.541">we&amp;#39;ve been noticing that the economy has</text>
  <text start="128.869" dur="4.561">been deteriorating and I remember back</text>
  <text start="130.16" dur="6.48">in 2013 President Hollande right during</text>
  <text start="133.43" dur="4.8">that false flag sarin gas attack where</text>
  <text start="136.64" dur="3.75">he was talking to the French people</text>
  <text start="138.23" dur="3.24">saying that the economy is going to be</text>
  <text start="140.39" dur="2.58">doing much much better</text>
  <text start="141.47" dur="4.2">unemployment&amp;#39;s going to come way down</text>
  <text start="142.97" dur="4.86">everyone&amp;#39;s going to have jobs and we see</text>
  <text start="145.67" dur="5.34">this improving in 2014 getting better in</text>
  <text start="147.83" dur="7.079">2015 and it&amp;#39;s going to break out in 2016</text>
  <text start="151.01" dur="5.58">2017 well here we are in 2017 and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="154.909" dur="4.44">not seeing this at all actually we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="156.59" dur="6.539">starting to see many different areas</text>
  <text start="159.349" dur="6.271">within the European Union really start</text>
  <text start="163.129" dur="4.17">to break down we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="165.62" dur="4.32">Greece over time and we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="167.299" dur="5.281">youth unemployment well that is very</text>
  <text start="169.94" dur="4.469">very high mean we&amp;#39;re talking about 30 40</text>
  <text start="172.58" dur="4.4">percent and remember they use</text>
  <text start="174.409" dur="5.401">unemployment that is the next generation</text>
  <text start="176.98" dur="4.24">this is what they&amp;#39;re counting on because</text>
  <text start="179.81" dur="3.509">they want these individuals to make</text>
  <text start="181.22" dur="4.18">money they want these individuals to</text>
  <text start="183.319" dur="3.581">save then they can go out and purchase</text>
  <text start="185.4" dur="3.75">homes they can go out and purchase cars</text>
  <text start="186.9" dur="4.08">they can go to retail and purchase but</text>
  <text start="189.15" dur="4.559">throughout the European countries in</text>
  <text start="190.98" dur="5.789">kinetic in Canada in the US and</text>
  <text start="193.709" dur="6.631">Australia we&amp;#39;re not actually seeing this</text>
  <text start="196.769" dur="5.371">happen and out in Italy what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="200.34" dur="5.119">seeing is that there&amp;#39;s a number of</text>
  <text start="202.14" dur="6.33">Italians they are living in absolute</text>
  <text start="205.459" dur="7.511">poverty and it has reached the highest</text>
  <text start="208.47" dur="6.03">level for more than 10 years now this is</text>
  <text start="212.97" dur="3.42">coming from the Italian National</text>
  <text start="214.5" dur="4.079">Institute of Statistics and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="216.39" dur="4.8">looking at Italy and they&amp;#39;re saying yeah</text>
  <text start="218.579" dur="4.8">we have a major problem here now</text>
  <text start="221.19" dur="7.889">according to the agency the number of</text>
  <text start="223.379" dur="9.151">absolute poor rose from 4.7 million last</text>
  <text start="229.079" dur="9.201">year against an almost 1.7 million in</text>
  <text start="232.53" dur="9.599">2006 so it is up by 3 million people and</text>
  <text start="238.28" dur="8.14">this shows you that things are not</text>
  <text start="242.129" dur="6.121">improving there and among the youth this</text>
  <text start="246.42" dur="4.8">number is continually growing now</text>
  <text start="248.25" dur="7.26">remember this is the generation that</text>
  <text start="251.22" dur="8.1">will define how the country does going</text>
  <text start="255.51" dur="5.31">forward and we can see throughout the US</text>
  <text start="259.32" dur="5.37">Canada Australia in all these different</text>
  <text start="260.82" dur="5.7">countries the next generation well many</text>
  <text start="264.69" dur="4.32">of them cannot find jobs many have</text>
  <text start="266.52" dur="5.79">part-time jobs many have no jobs</text>
  <text start="269.01" dur="5.25">whatsoever and they&amp;#39;re not saving money</text>
  <text start="272.31" dur="3.03">they&amp;#39;re making less than they&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="274.26" dur="3.81">done before</text>
  <text start="275.34" dur="7.319">and they&amp;#39;re not out there buying cars</text>
  <text start="278.07" dur="7.2">buying homes and spending in retail so</text>
  <text start="282.659" dur="4.5">we have a major problem on our hand this</text>
  <text start="285.27" dur="5.16">is what it looks like when an entire</text>
  <text start="287.159" dur="5.82">system starts imploding on itself now we</text>
  <text start="290.43" dur="4.919">talked about how retail is doing very</text>
  <text start="292.979" dur="5.25">very poorly we&amp;#39;ve talked about the</text>
  <text start="295.349" dur="5.011">restaurant industry and when we start to</text>
  <text start="298.229" dur="4.051">look at the restaurant industry well we</text>
  <text start="300.36" dur="4.65">noticed something very interesting</text>
  <text start="302.28" dur="5.4">well we notice that same store sales</text>
  <text start="305.01" dur="4.86">well that is dropping traffic is</text>
  <text start="307.68" dur="4.53">dropping and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="309.87" dur="5.25">that a lot of these restaurants they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="312.21" dur="5.04">continually hiring people it&amp;#39;s starting</text>
  <text start="315.12" dur="4.31">to slow quite a bit and we have</text>
  <text start="317.25" dur="4.83">unemployment very very low</text>
  <text start="319.43" dur="5.35">but there is a disconnect that has</text>
  <text start="322.08" dur="5.27">emerged because when we look at</text>
  <text start="324.78" dur="5.61">restaurant retail sales</text>
  <text start="327.35" dur="8.02">well restaurant retail sales year on</text>
  <text start="330.39" dur="7.65">year they have been declining but the</text>
  <text start="335.37" dur="6.54">unemployment rate has continually gone</text>
  <text start="338.04" dur="6.33">down and these same restaurants they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="341.91" dur="4.92">been hiring people something doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="344.37" dur="4.79">make sense but when we look at Bank of</text>
  <text start="346.83" dur="5.67">America&amp;#39;s internal spending data well</text>
  <text start="349.16" dur="5.61">that actually reinforces what is</text>
  <text start="352.5" dur="7.64">happening here that food and service and</text>
  <text start="354.77" dur="9.19">drink places the revenue is continually</text>
  <text start="360.14" dur="6.7">declining and it&amp;#39;s showing us that there</text>
  <text start="363.96" dur="4.98">is a major problem now actually the</text>
  <text start="366.84" dur="4.95">restaurant industry is stuck in its</text>
  <text start="368.94" dur="5.99">longest slump since the second Great</text>
  <text start="371.79" dur="6.66">Depression US consumer spending is</text>
  <text start="374.93" dur="5.59">continually declining in this area so</text>
  <text start="378.45" dur="4.62">what do we say we see that there are</text>
  <text start="380.52" dur="4.32">many individuals who have no job</text>
  <text start="383.07" dur="3.03">whatsoever they&amp;#39;ve fallen off and the</text>
  <text start="384.84" dur="3.18">government just doesn&amp;#39;t count them</text>
  <text start="386.1" dur="4.56">because they think oh they just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="388.02" dur="4.38">want a job of course they do many people</text>
  <text start="390.66" dur="3.48">have a part-time job where that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="392.4" dur="5.37">considered a full-time job so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.14" dur="7.71">completely manipulated and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="397.77" dur="8">looking at is that overtime wages have</text>
  <text start="401.85" dur="6.87">been declining there are no jobs and</text>
  <text start="405.77" dur="5.86">retail is imploding the restaurant</text>
  <text start="408.72" dur="4.11">industry is imploding there&amp;#39;s 20 cities</text>
  <text start="411.63" dur="3.36">that are keeping the whole housing</text>
  <text start="412.83" dur="6.18">market up but the rest of the housing</text>
  <text start="414.99" dur="6.57">market that has been manipulated by</text>
  <text start="419.01" dur="4.92">hedge funds investment company foreign</text>
  <text start="421.56" dur="4.68">investors that come in and buy thousands</text>
  <text start="423.93" dur="4.32">and thousands of houses and rent them</text>
  <text start="426.24" dur="5.1">out but keep them off the market so it</text>
  <text start="428.25" dur="4.92">drives prices up the banks were told the</text>
  <text start="431.34" dur="4.02">same thing listen if you foreclose keep</text>
  <text start="433.17" dur="4.41">that house on the market because it</text>
  <text start="435.36" dur="5.88">shows that there&amp;#39;s no inventory which</text>
  <text start="437.58" dur="5.1">drives prices up and from everything</text>
  <text start="441.24" dur="5.3">that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at we can see</text>
  <text start="442.68" dur="7.02">that this whole thing is one giant</text>
  <text start="446.54" dur="5.8">manipulation now we could see that the</text>
  <text start="449.7" dur="5.91">central banker the powers-that-be</text>
  <text start="452.34" dur="6.45">they are in a rush right now to D cache</text>
  <text start="455.61" dur="6.69">they want everyone using no cash</text>
  <text start="458.79" dur="6.96">whatsoever now remember having cash no</text>
  <text start="462.3" dur="7.83">cash this is not the issue the issue is</text>
  <text start="465.75" dur="7.08">who&amp;#39;s controlling this because if you</text>
  <text start="470.13" dur="6.78">think about this the central bankers</text>
  <text start="472.83" dur="5.64">they want an electronic economy but</text>
  <text start="476.91" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re going to be in control of it I</text>
  <text start="478.47" dur="5.699">have no problem with electronic economy</text>
  <text start="480.87" dur="4.859">makes things a lot easier but it has to</text>
  <text start="484.169" dur="4.461">be decentralized</text>
  <text start="485.729" dur="6.361">there could be not one entity</text>
  <text start="488.63" dur="5.77">controlling it and this is where we have</text>
  <text start="492.09" dur="4.74">the problem this is the bigger issue</text>
  <text start="494.4" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s not oh they&amp;#39;re taking away cash</text>
  <text start="496.83" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re doing things like that it&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="498.66" dur="5.94">the central bank wants to bring us into</text>
  <text start="501.27" dur="5.1">this electronic currency and they want</text>
  <text start="504.6" dur="5.64">to control the whole thing so like we</text>
  <text start="506.37" dur="5.13">said before Visa well they are looking</text>
  <text start="510.24" dur="4.02">at different vendors and saying listen</text>
  <text start="511.5" dur="5.279">we&amp;#39;re going to make offers to you we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="514.26" dur="4.56">going to say listen do not accept cash</text>
  <text start="516.779" dur="3.75">now they&amp;#39;re doing this to one of the</text>
  <text start="518.82" dur="3.87">places one of the industries where they</text>
  <text start="520.529" dur="4.201">take on a lot of cash and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="522.69" dur="4.32">department stores it&amp;#39;s not little retail</text>
  <text start="524.73" dur="5.4">stores we know online does not take cash</text>
  <text start="527.01" dur="6.53">it&amp;#39;s the restaurants the cafes the food</text>
  <text start="530.13" dur="8.97">trucks they&amp;#39;re challenging these</text>
  <text start="533.54" dur="9.16">entities to stop accepting cash and they</text>
  <text start="539.1" dur="6.38">announced this by offering 500,000 to 50</text>
  <text start="542.7" dur="7.59">eligible us-based eateries to go 100%</text>
  <text start="545.48" dur="7.57">cashless this is the push to get all</text>
  <text start="550.29" dur="6.36">these companies to accept electronic</text>
  <text start="553.05" dur="5.82">only because they&amp;#39;re the clock right now</text>
  <text start="556.65" dur="4.04">is ticking down they know they only have</text>
  <text start="558.87" dur="4.77">a certain period of time to go</text>
  <text start="560.69" dur="4.87">completely cashless because the central</text>
  <text start="563.64" dur="3.3">bank&amp;#39;s their plan is to control</text>
  <text start="565.56" dur="3.27">everything now remember when the economy</text>
  <text start="566.94" dur="5.58">comes down they&amp;#39;re going to be ushering</text>
  <text start="568.83" dur="7.44">and ushering in a new system this new</text>
  <text start="572.52" dur="7.34">system and if you listen to Lynette Zeng</text>
  <text start="576.27" dur="6.6">she&amp;#39;s talking about a higher level</text>
  <text start="579.86" dur="5.17">monetary system where governments</text>
  <text start="582.87" dur="3.36">corporations will use this to trade and</text>
  <text start="585.03" dur="3.86">then for</text>
  <text start="586.23" dur="5.34">people they&amp;#39;re looking at some type of</text>
  <text start="588.89" dur="5.5">electronic type of currency she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="591.57" dur="6.15">calling it a dollar coin now again</text>
  <text start="594.39" dur="6.84">cryptocurrency blockchain technology</text>
  <text start="597.72" dur="6.69">very good but we don&amp;#39;t want the central</text>
  <text start="601.23" dur="6.9">bank controlling this this is the big</text>
  <text start="604.41" dur="6.24">deal and they know that time is running</text>
  <text start="608.13" dur="3.15">out this is why they are pushing so hard</text>
  <text start="610.65" dur="3.21">right now</text>
  <text start="611.28" dur="6.39">it&amp;#39;s not about op-eds or talk right now</text>
  <text start="613.86" dur="5.94">these credit card companies the banking</text>
  <text start="617.67" dur="5.01">system they are pushing this because</text>
  <text start="619.8" dur="6.21">they realize now is the time because</text>
  <text start="622.68" dur="4.92">when this system comes down this is the</text>
  <text start="626.01" dur="3.3">reset this is how they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="627.6" dur="5.52">proceed at least this is what they want</text>
  <text start="629.31" dur="6.21">to do now we know that this economy is</text>
  <text start="633.12" dur="3.84">completely fake phony and false because</text>
  <text start="635.52" dur="3.12">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all the numbers</text>
  <text start="636.96" dur="5.25">and we see how they manipulate and what</text>
  <text start="638.64" dur="5.88">we come to find is that Illinois well</text>
  <text start="642.21" dur="3.93">they manipulated everything how did they</text>
  <text start="644.52" dur="3.69">do it how did they make it seem like</text>
  <text start="646.14" dur="5.25">everything was fine and they told the</text>
  <text start="648.21" dur="5.97">people everything was fine one way that</text>
  <text start="651.39" dur="5.55">Illinois managed to fix its budget</text>
  <text start="654.18" dur="5.12">crisis which they like to call kicking</text>
  <text start="656.94" dur="7.68">it down kicking the can down the road</text>
  <text start="659.3" dur="8.83">what they did was they manipulated the</text>
  <text start="664.62" dur="6.09">numbers so how do they do it well they</text>
  <text start="668.13" dur="5.06">simply decided to continue modeling</text>
  <text start="670.71" dur="5.19">future returns at a much higher rate</text>
  <text start="673.19" dur="4.3">than they&amp;#39;ll ever be able to reasonably</text>
  <text start="675.9" dur="2.76">achieve now of course they said listen</text>
  <text start="677.49" dur="2.93">we&amp;#39;re going to be doing about seven</text>
  <text start="678.66" dur="4.53">percent seven and a half percent and</text>
  <text start="680.42" dur="4.78">they managed to reduce the present value</text>
  <text start="683.19" dur="4.13">of future liabilities and thus reduce</text>
  <text start="685.2" dur="6.24">current funding requirements in short</text>
  <text start="687.32" dur="4.75">they tweaked one simple number and like</text>
  <text start="691.44" dur="3.72">magic</text>

  <text start="768.209" dur="5.521">make you believe now Ron Paul is out</text>
  <text start="770.67" dur="4.82">there saying listen this is when we know</text>
  <text start="773.73" dur="6.479">we have a problem</text>
  <text start="775.49" dur="6.19">when the central bank comes out and they</text>
  <text start="780.209" dur="3.87">tell you something that we&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="781.68" dur="5.04">to see any type of disaster or any type</text>
  <text start="784.079" dur="5.101">of financial crisis in our lifetime this</text>
  <text start="786.72" dur="5.52">is when you need to where he says this</text>
  <text start="789.18" dur="5.67">actually scares me because central</text>
  <text start="792.24" dur="4.23">bankers are always wrong know what what</text>
  <text start="794.85" dur="5.46">I need to correct them a little bit here</text>
  <text start="796.47" dur="6.21">what they do is they lie to make you</text>
  <text start="800.31" dur="5.25">believe just like the banks in Spain</text>
  <text start="802.68" dur="4.889">when they told the you know mom and pop</text>
  <text start="805.56" dur="3.92">retailers don&amp;#39;t worry your money&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="807.569" dur="3.991">to be safe in the meantime the</text>
  <text start="809.48" dur="4.81">corporation&amp;#39;s the insiders that they</text>
  <text start="811.56" dur="4.11">were draining their accounts because</text>
  <text start="814.29" dur="2.97">they knew what was coming and all those</text>
  <text start="815.67" dur="2.789">other people thought oh everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="817.26" dur="2.34">going to be fine I could lose my money</text>
  <text start="818.459" dur="3.721">there will be everything will be okay</text>
  <text start="819.6" dur="5.609">and what happened was they got screwed</text>
  <text start="822.18" dur="5.25">and the other people got out this is how</text>
  <text start="825.209" dur="3.901">it works and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="827.43" dur="3.54">is these central bankers are going to</text>
  <text start="829.11" dur="9.27">try to push the market up even further</text>
  <text start="830.97" dur="9.869">why to keep the illusion alive and while</text>
  <text start="838.38" dur="5.04">everyone is staring at that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="840.839" dur="5.581">making preparations behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="843.42" dur="5.789">they&amp;#39;re getting ready for the reset and</text>
  <text start="846.42" dur="5.279">they don&amp;#39;t care that you lose all your</text>
  <text start="849.209" dur="4.411">wealth who cares we&amp;#39;re going for a reset</text>
  <text start="851.699" dur="4.711">it makes no difference</text>
  <text start="853.62" dur="4.23">but the insiders they&amp;#39;re going to make</text>
  <text start="856.41" dur="3.39">as much as they possibly can because</text>
  <text start="857.85" dur="3.72">remember they&amp;#39;re the insiders and when</text>
  <text start="859.8" dur="5.789">we go through this reset they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="861.57" dur="6.269">to become even wealthier and everyone</text>
  <text start="865.589" dur="4.761">else is going to get poor that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="867.839" dur="6.69">normally happens because if you look at</text>
  <text start="870.35" dur="6.25">what happened in Russia in 1998 many of</text>
  <text start="874.529" dur="5.301">the people lost their pensions many of</text>
  <text start="876.6" dur="6.75">people lost their savings they saw in</text>
  <text start="879.83" dur="5.86">hyperinflation and we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="883.35" dur="5.13">the same exact thing because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="885.69" dur="5.31">going to be a transition period as we go</text>
  <text start="888.48" dur="7.17">through this because they need to take</text>
  <text start="891" dur="6.839">the old system devalue it and bring on</text>
  <text start="895.65" dur="5.82">the new system and they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="897.839" dur="5.911">give you a one-to-one ratio here and we</text>
  <text start="901.47" dur="5.22">could see how this is all being played</text>
  <text start="903.75" dur="5.64">out right now and we are definitely</text>
  <text start="906.69" dur="4.62">heading towards that period of time and</text>
  <text start="909.39" dur="4.05">this is why you need to be ready</text>
  <text start="911.31" dur="4.529">financially you need to be ready with</text>
  <text start="913.44" dur="4.8">food and water because if you look at</text>
  <text start="915.839" dur="4.171">what happened in 1998 with Russia as it</text>
  <text start="918.24" dur="2.37">collapsed the shelves were completely</text>
  <text start="920.01" dur="4.05">empty</text>
  <text start="920.61" dur="6.65">remember the credit impulse the credit</text>
  <text start="924.06" dur="6.57">market right now it&amp;#39;s freezing up and</text>
  <text start="927.26" dur="5.199">once it totally freezes up all</text>
  <text start="930.63" dur="3.51">deliveries everything that we see right</text>
  <text start="932.459" dur="4.231">now comes to a halt</text>
  <text start="934.14" dur="4.68">we don&amp;#39;t have trade anymore during this</text>
  <text start="936.69" dur="4.95">period because remember everything was</text>
  <text start="938.82" dur="4.5">based on the petro dollar now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="941.64" dur="4.949">going to have to trade good trade goods</text>
  <text start="943.32" dur="4.92">what what do we have here not much this</text>
  <text start="946.589" dur="4.741">is why Trump has been trying to bring</text>
  <text start="948.24" dur="5.969">back manufacturing this needs to be</text>
  <text start="951.33" dur="7.14">brought back to help the country after</text>
  <text start="954.209" dur="6.961">the transition so during this transition</text>
  <text start="958.47" dur="5.22">period this is the part where you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="961.17" dur="6.87">going to be you&amp;#39;re going to need to be</text>
  <text start="963.69" dur="6.3">prepared for this time period how long</text>
  <text start="968.04" dur="2.97">it&amp;#39;ll be some people say six months some</text>
  <text start="969.99" dur="3.26">people say four years</text>
  <text start="971.01" dur="4.92">some people say two years we don&amp;#39;t know</text>

  <text start="975.93" dur="2.94">water because you don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="977.4" dur="4.02">running to the market like everyone else</text>
  <text start="978.87" dur="4.589">trying to get these supplies you need</text>
  <text start="981.42" dur="5.7">gold and silver this is a store of</text>
  <text start="983.459" dur="6.271">wealth this will help you</text>
  <text start="987.12" dur="4.469">because the dollar yes you need to hold</text>
  <text start="989.73" dur="3.899">them in the beginning but as they</text>
  <text start="991.589" dur="6.511">continually devalue they&amp;#39;ll become</text>
  <text start="993.629" dur="6.06">worthless pieces of paper and when we</text>
  <text start="998.1" dur="4.649">move on to a new system whatever that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="999.689" dur="4.77">going to be hopefully we can get rid of</text>
  <text start="1002.749" dur="4.231">the central bank at this point in time</text>
  <text start="1004.459" dur="3.99">we can make sure that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1006.98" dur="4.799">control in the next system because that</text>
  <text start="1008.449" dur="6.24">would be a better thing for the people</text>
  <text start="1011.779" dur="6.961">around the world where we&amp;#39;re in control</text>
  <text start="1014.689" dur="6.84">of the monetary system not a central</text>
  <text start="1018.74" dur="5.219">bank which is private and their agenda</text>
