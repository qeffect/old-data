  <text start="106.729" dur="5.221">not just here in the United States but</text>
  <text start="108.77" dur="6.48">around the world Trump has been chipping</text>
  <text start="111.95" dur="5.88">away at the globalist system he needs to</text>
  <text start="115.25" dur="4.709">unwind everything the globalist the</text>
  <text start="117.83" dur="4.8">central banks have done over the many</text>
  <text start="119.959" dur="4.651">many years he can&amp;#39;t do this by snapping</text>
  <text start="122.63" dur="3.75">his finger and just having it done he</text>
  <text start="124.61" dur="4.08">has to take one piece at a time and</text>
  <text start="126.38" dur="6.51">we&amp;#39;ve been watching the World Trade</text>
  <text start="128.69" dur="7.14">Organization the World Bank the Fed and</text>

  <text start="138.83" dur="3.48">talking about that a little bit later in</text>
  <text start="140.72" dur="3.96">this report but first I wanted to start</text>
  <text start="142.31" dur="3.81">off with how the economy is doing and I</text>
  <text start="144.68" dur="2.79">know the numbers that Trump has been</text>
  <text start="146.12" dur="3.119">putting out there the government&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="147.47" dur="4.23">putting out there and remember there are</text>
  <text start="149.239" dur="6.381">two separate things happening here</text>
  <text start="151.7" dur="7.59">there&amp;#39;s one which is the illusion for</text>
  <text start="155.62" dur="6.25">the people for the mainstream media for</text>
  <text start="159.29" dur="4.87">the deep state to make everyone feel</text>
  <text start="161.87" dur="4.96">like the economy&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="164.16" dur="5.25">better now the economy is doing better</text>
  <text start="166.83" dur="5.4">in the fact that Trump is bringing back</text>
  <text start="169.41" dur="5.28">manufacturing jobs removing the</text>
  <text start="172.23" dur="5.49">globalist system preparing us for the</text>
  <text start="174.69" dur="5.46">transition he needs to keep the illusion</text>
  <text start="177.72" dur="5.79">alive that the economy is doing well</text>
  <text start="180.15" dur="5.58">this way the central bankers the deep</text>
  <text start="183.51" dur="5.22">state the mainstream media have a</text>
  <text start="185.73" dur="4.95">difficult time pointing to him as the</text>
  <text start="188.73" dur="3.87">problem of the economy this is why they</text>
  <text start="190.68" dur="4.14">came out with their prediction that in</text>
  <text start="192.6" dur="4.5">2020 there&amp;#39;s going to be recession this</text>
  <text start="194.82" dur="4.71">is why q has been telling us don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="197.1" dur="5.7">we know their plan this is not going to</text>
  <text start="199.53" dur="4.86">happen now they were pushing the idea</text>
  <text start="202.8" dur="3.48">that it was tariffs and everything that</text>
  <text start="204.39" dur="4.53">he was doing but we know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="206.28" dur="4.37">nervous and afraid that if he or when he</text>
  <text start="208.92" dur="6.45">undoes everything that they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="210.65" dur="7.39">we&amp;#39;re going to see incredible times they</text>
  <text start="215.37" dur="3.9">don&amp;#39;t want this to happen the central</text>
  <text start="218.04" dur="5.04">bankers don&amp;#39;t want that the hammock you</text>
  <text start="219.27" dur="7.17">imagine a world where the world is doing</text>
  <text start="223.08" dur="6.6">fantastically economically people are</text>
  <text start="226.44" dur="3.9">get it are working together people like</text>
  <text start="229.68" dur="4.2">each other</text>
  <text start="230.34" dur="6.27">there&amp;#39;s peace in the world and everyone</text>
  <text start="233.88" dur="4.47">is doing well do you think the central</text>
  <text start="236.61" dur="4.8">banks are going to like this do you</text>
  <text start="238.35" dur="5.16">think the deep state likes this no this</text>
  <text start="241.41" dur="5.31">is what they&amp;#39;re trying to stop because</text>
  <text start="243.51" dur="5.34">once the people get a taste of just a</text>
  <text start="246.72" dur="3.18">little bit of this guess what you think</text>
  <text start="248.85" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re ever gonna want to go back to a</text>
  <text start="249.9" dur="5.309">central banking system absolutely not so</text>
  <text start="253.59" dur="3.72">we have two things happening here we</text>
  <text start="255.209" dur="4.551">have the real economy which we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="257.31" dur="5.1">reporting on and then we have Trump</text>
  <text start="259.76" dur="6.01">confusing the deep state confusing the</text>
  <text start="262.41" dur="5.91">central bank all at the same time now as</text>
  <text start="265.77" dur="4.38">more and more people come back to the</text>
  <text start="268.32" dur="4.68">United States as companies come back to</text>
  <text start="270.15" dur="6.18">the United States as he rewrites NAFTA</text>
  <text start="273" dur="6.81">gets rid of TPP and rewrites other trade</text>
  <text start="276.33" dur="5.27">deals the central bank econo remember</text>
  <text start="279.81" dur="5.1">this is not Trump&amp;#39;s economy this is a</text>
  <text start="281.6" dur="4.99">central bank economy and we&amp;#39;re not just</text>
  <text start="284.91" dur="4.05">seeing it fall apart here in the United</text>
  <text start="286.59" dur="4.71">States we&amp;#39;re seeing it fall apart around</text>
  <text start="288.96" dur="3.48">the world and the central banks are</text>
  <text start="291.3" dur="2.76">stuck they don&amp;#39;t know how to explain</text>
  <text start="292.44" dur="3.75">this they&amp;#39;re trying to point the finger</text>
  <text start="294.06" dur="3.53">in every direction but they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="296.19" dur="3.41">who are responsible for this</text>
  <text start="297.59" dur="3.96">so the people&amp;#39;s economy here in the</text>
  <text start="299.6" dur="4.319">United States it is deteriorating very</text>
  <text start="301.55" dur="5.089">very quickly if we look at factory</text>
  <text start="303.919" dur="5.641">orders back in October and November</text>
  <text start="306.639" dur="6.341">we&amp;#39;re seeing that factory orders they</text>
  <text start="309.56" dur="5.91">have tumbled they declined and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="312.98" dur="3.99">not improving at the time actually we</text>
  <text start="315.47" dur="3.81">should have seen factory orders doing</text>
  <text start="316.97" dur="3.54">really well during this time period but</text>
  <text start="319.28" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;re starting to see factory orders</text>
  <text start="320.51" dur="4.53">decline in this area now what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="323.54" dur="3.93">happen on which I do believe is going to</text>
  <text start="325.04" dur="4.53">happen is as we move through this</text>
  <text start="327.47" dur="3.93">transition and as Trump keeps the</text>
  <text start="329.57" dur="3.96">illusion alive we&amp;#39;re gonna see the</text>
  <text start="331.4" dur="3.989">people&amp;#39;s economy deteriorate further and</text>
  <text start="333.53" dur="5.19">further and further and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="335.389" dur="7.111">see the illusion that economy with the</text>
  <text start="338.72" dur="8.4">stock market with unemployment with GDP</text>
  <text start="342.5" dur="7.32">we&amp;#39;re going to see that improve so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="347.12" dur="6.6">gonna see two things happening at the</text>
  <text start="349.82" dur="6.09">same exact time and the reason why this</text>
  <text start="353.72" dur="5.13">is happening is because we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="355.91" dur="6.96">moving out of the central bank economy</text>
  <text start="358.85" dur="5.87">now very interestingly we know that the</text>
  <text start="362.87" dur="5.01">central bankers if we go back in time</text>
  <text start="364.72" dur="6.4">they were planning to move the system</text>
  <text start="367.88" dur="5.4">out of the United States and this is why</text>
  <text start="371.12" dur="5.12">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to bring the United</text>
  <text start="373.28" dur="7.23">States down to a third-world level and</text>
  <text start="376.24" dur="8.26">when we look at the economy we can see</text>
  <text start="380.51" dur="4.5">back in 1971 when we came off the gold</text>
  <text start="384.5" dur="3.389">standard</text>
  <text start="385.01" dur="5.31">we had the neocons we had the deep state</text>
  <text start="387.889" dur="5.101">we had the central bankers pushing their</text>
  <text start="390.32" dur="4.73">agenda get us off the gold standard</text>
  <text start="392.99" dur="6.48">get us on the petrodollar system and</text>
  <text start="395.05" dur="7.96">then move forward with their agenda and</text>
  <text start="399.47" dur="4.949">that is Wars taking control establishing</text>
  <text start="403.01" dur="3.659">bases around the world</text>
  <text start="404.419" dur="4.731">installing central banks private central</text>
  <text start="406.669" dur="6.291">banks in all these different countries</text>
  <text start="409.15" dur="6.22">now Trump he has to undo all of this</text>
  <text start="412.96" dur="5.07">he&amp;#39;s not for globalism he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="415.37" dur="4.98">nationalist and we know that the</text>
  <text start="418.03" dur="5.139">globalists they use sanctions in the</text>
  <text start="420.35" dur="5.67">past to force countries into doing what</text>
  <text start="423.169" dur="6.091">they wanted now Trump is doing something</text>
  <text start="426.02" dur="4.669">very very interesting he&amp;#39;s using the</text>
  <text start="429.26" dur="5.779">same exact</text>
  <text start="430.689" dur="7.83">players to take everything that they set</text>
  <text start="435.039" dur="8.25">up and undo it and they don&amp;#39;t even know</text>
  <text start="438.519" dur="6.75">they&amp;#39;re being used think about it the</text>
  <text start="443.289" dur="5.34">world of international diplomacy is</text>
  <text start="445.269" dur="6.15">being turned inside out they don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="448.629" dur="4.83">know what side is up what side is down</text>
  <text start="451.419" dur="4.2">anymore take North Korea for instance</text>
  <text start="453.459" dur="5.1">they had no clue what was going on</text>
  <text start="455.619" dur="4.86">take Syria in for instance when they had</text>
  <text start="458.559" dur="3.93">Bolton out there saying that you know</text>
  <text start="460.479" dur="4.47">the troops aren&amp;#39;t leaving until Aranda</text>
  <text start="462.489" dur="4.79">leaves and then Trump made the</text>
  <text start="464.949" dur="5.7">announcement that the troops are leaving</text>
  <text start="467.279" dur="6.55">these individuals that are in these</text>
  <text start="470.649" dur="7.2">positions they&amp;#39;re being used for a</text>
  <text start="473.829" dur="7.11">specific purpose think about this for a</text>
  <text start="477.849" dur="6.3">second countries right now they are</text>
  <text start="480.939" dur="4.91">proceeding to D dollar eyes and replace</text>
  <text start="484.149" dur="5.4">what the US diplomacy calls</text>
  <text start="485.849" dur="7">internationalism with their own national</text>
  <text start="489.549" dur="5.55">self-interest sound familiar</text>
  <text start="492.849" dur="6.12">does it sound like something Trump is</text>
  <text start="495.099" dur="7.08">trying to do well Trump actually wants</text>
  <text start="498.969" dur="5.46">this to happen because he&amp;#39;s undoing</text>
  <text start="502.179" dur="6.871">everything the globalists have been</text>
  <text start="504.429" dur="7.621">doing populist nationalism is today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="509.05" dur="6.089">road to election victory in Europe and</text>
  <text start="512.05" dur="8.489">other countries and they&amp;#39;re following</text>
  <text start="515.139" dur="7.89">what Trump has done Trump&amp;#39;s agenda may</text>
  <text start="520.539" dur="5.641">really be to break up the American</text>
  <text start="523.029" dur="6.631">Empire the central bank the deep state</text>
  <text start="526.18" dur="8.279">empire and he&amp;#39;s going for the Empire&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="529.66" dur="8.34">most vital organs he&amp;#39;s dismantling the</text>
  <text start="534.459" dur="8.63">central bank dollar removing the petro</text>
  <text start="538" dur="7.889">dollar going after the central banks and</text>
  <text start="543.089" dur="5.8">establishing some type of gold standard</text>
  <text start="545.889" dur="4.95">so what have we been seeing happen here</text>
  <text start="548.889" dur="3.361">well Germany in many other countries</text>
  <text start="550.839" dur="3.451">they&amp;#39;ve been repaid trading their gold</text>
  <text start="552.25" dur="5.009">other countries have been purchasing</text>
  <text start="554.29" dur="6.06">gold and q has been telling us that gold</text>
  <text start="557.259" dur="8.491">will bring down the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="560.35" dur="8.58">we have Venezuela Venezuela they were</text>
  <text start="565.75" dur="5.72">desperate to spend its gold reserves to</text>
  <text start="568.93" dur="5.58">provide imports for its economy</text>
  <text start="571.47" dur="5.65">devastated by US sanctions now these US</text>
  <text start="574.51" dur="5.25">sanctions were put on Venezuela way</text>
  <text start="577.12" dur="6.24">before Trump and they were hurting the</text>
  <text start="579.76" dur="5.85">everyday person so Venezuela directed</text>
  <text start="583.36" dur="4.5">the Bank of England to transfer some of</text>
  <text start="585.61" dur="4.41">its 11 billion in gold held in its in</text>
  <text start="587.86" dur="4.98">its vaults and those of other central</text>
  <text start="590.02" dur="5.79">banks in December of 2018 the US</text>
  <text start="592.84" dur="7.11">officials are now trying to steer</text>

  <text start="599.95" dur="4.92">guido to help bolster his chances of</text>
  <text start="603.12" dur="4.72">effectively taking control of the</text>
  <text start="604.87" dur="4.44">government the 1.2 billion of gold is a</text>
  <text start="607.84" dur="3.33">big chunk of the eight billion in</text>
  <text start="609.31" dur="4.92">foreign reserves held by the Venezuelan</text>

  <text start="622.3" dur="3.87">it</text>
  <text start="622.89" dur="8.47">think about what they were ordered to do</text>
  <text start="626.17" dur="8.07">they were ordered to stop the central</text>
  <text start="631.36" dur="5.73">banks from selling the gold of Venezuela</text>
  <text start="634.24" dur="6.66">and the gold is being sent back to</text>
  <text start="637.09" dur="6.32">Venezuela very interesting why would</text>
  <text start="640.9" dur="5.52">they care about that well of course</text>
  <text start="643.41" dur="5.56">they&amp;#39;re going to give this to one Guido</text>
  <text start="646.42" dur="4.68">but think about what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="648.97" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re countering what the central bank</text>
  <text start="651.1" dur="5.34">wanted to do so the central bank</text>
  <text start="654.01" dur="5.25">officials in Caracas have been ordered</text>
  <text start="656.44" dur="5.13">to no longer try canting contacting the</text>
  <text start="659.26" dur="4.02">Bank of England the central bankers have</text>
  <text start="661.57" dur="5.1">been told that the Bank of England</text>
  <text start="663.28" dur="5.7">staffers will not respond to them so</text>
  <text start="666.67" dur="5.37">normally what the deep State does with</text>
  <text start="668.98" dur="6.27">these countries they believe them dry</text>
  <text start="672.04" dur="4.35">they remove all the gold and when I say</text>
  <text start="675.25" dur="4.65">remove it they steal it</text>
