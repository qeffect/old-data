  <text start="222.17" dur="5.95">everything that they&amp;#39;re doing taking on</text>
  <text start="224.519" dur="7.59">more and more debt just doesn&amp;#39;t work and</text>

  <text start="232.109" dur="5.431">of the Spanish citizens don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="234.18" dur="6.54">prime minister at all and a year ago</text>
  <text start="237.54" dur="5.55">thirty percent of the Spaniards so 2014</text>

  <text start="243.09" dur="6.149">number is down to seventeen percent and</text>
  <text start="246.35" dur="4.81">we all know same thing that&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="249.239" dur="4.711">here the Congress has the lowest</text>

  <text start="253.95" dur="3.75">people of the u.s. don&amp;#39;t even trust the</text>
  <text start="255.959" dur="3.96">government right now they believe the</text>
  <text start="257.7" dur="4.589">government is the source of the problem</text>
  <text start="259.919" dur="6.091">and this is how it begins and I saw a</text>
  <text start="262.289" dur="6.75">report saying that most of the we the</text>
  <text start="266.01" dur="5.55">people petitions are not even being</text>
  <text start="269.039" dur="4.201">answered by the government when they</text>
  <text start="271.56" dur="2.91">reach the amount of signatures that are</text>
  <text start="273.24" dur="2.76">required</text>
  <text start="274.47" dur="3.93">they are just sitting there for a year</text>
  <text start="276" dur="5.1">two years they&amp;#39;re not even being</text>
  <text start="278.4" dur="5.79">answered anymore because the government</text>
  <text start="281.1" dur="4.74">doesn&amp;#39;t care they are looking out for</text>
  <text start="284.19" dur="5.4">themselves they don&amp;#39;t care about the</text>
  <text start="285.84" dur="6.33">people when in reality they&amp;#39;re only</text>
  <text start="289.59" dur="6.12">there to care about the people and to</text>
  <text start="292.17" dur="5.82">take care of our wishes but we can see</text>
  <text start="295.71" dur="3.96">what&amp;#39;s happening all over the world the</text>
  <text start="297.99" dur="2.97">people are losing faith in their</text>
  <text start="299.67" dur="4.89">governments they don&amp;#39;t believe them</text>
  <text start="300.96" dur="7.08">anymore they don&amp;#39;t see a recovery they</text>
  <text start="304.56" dur="6.45">see things getting worse they see things</text>
  <text start="308.04" dur="4.65">are just not getting better even though</text>
  <text start="311.01" dur="3.18">the governments are telling them that</text>
  <text start="312.69" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re on their road to recovery and</text>
  <text start="314.19" dur="4.44">things are better here in the United</text>
  <text start="316.59" dur="4.38">States of course we had Obama out there</text>
  <text start="318.63" dur="4.35">campaigning that real estate is making a</text>
  <text start="320.97" dur="3.69">comeback they&amp;#39;re trying to let us know</text>
  <text start="322.98" dur="6.66">that unemployment is at its lowest level</text>
  <text start="324.66" dur="8.25">ever and the GDP inflation or GPS going</text>
  <text start="329.64" dur="5.52">up inflation is under control and the</text>
  <text start="332.91" dur="4.98">stock market is reaching all-time new</text>
  <text start="335.16" dur="6.84">highs and this is to make you believe in</text>
  <text start="337.89" dur="5.4">the illusion that the economy is getting</text>
  <text start="342" dur="3.45">better and of course all these numbers</text>
  <text start="343.29" dur="3.81">are manipulated they&amp;#39;ve changed the</text>
  <text start="345.45" dur="3.81">calculation of unemployment I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="347.1" dur="4.56">this many times and we can see what is</text>
  <text start="349.26" dur="5.159">happening right now and of course the</text>
  <text start="351.66" dur="4.44">stock market continually goes up gold is</text>
  <text start="354.419" dur="3.901">being pushed down it goes up a little</text>
  <text start="356.1" dur="4.83">bit but you&amp;#39;ll see they will push it</text>
  <text start="358.32" dur="5.22">back down again because they do not want</text>
  <text start="360.93" dur="4.739">people to realize that something is</text>
  <text start="363.54" dur="5.04">going on and if gold starts shooting up</text>
  <text start="365.669" dur="6">people are going to wonder why and they</text>
  <text start="368.58" dur="5.64">have to continually manipulate the gold</text>
  <text start="371.669" dur="7.531">price so no one catches on until the</text>
  <text start="374.22" dur="6.42">very last minute now in the UK they are</text>
  <text start="379.2" dur="3.41">trying to make ends meet just like</text>
  <text start="380.64" dur="4.71">everyone in every single country and</text>
  <text start="382.61" dur="5.5">because of rising bills and high housing</text>
  <text start="385.35" dur="5.61">costs are pushing many of the household</text>
  <text start="388.11" dur="5.01">budgets to the breaking point one in 11</text>
  <text start="390.96" dur="4.23">people are worried they will not be able</text>
  <text start="393.12" dur="4.07">to afford their rent or mortgage this</text>
  <text start="395.19" dur="4.83">month and this is in the UK and the</text>
  <text start="397.19" dur="4.5">warning comes days after a report from a</text>
  <text start="400.02" dur="3.57">resolution foundation think-tank</text>
  <text start="401.69" dur="3.789">indicating that more than a million</text>
  <text start="403.59" dur="3.81">homeowners could be at risk of</text>
  <text start="405.479" dur="2.65">defaulting on their mortgages at losing</text>
  <text start="407.4" dur="3.069">their properties</text>
  <text start="408.129" dur="5.04">in the wake of even a small rise in</text>
  <text start="410.469" dur="5.1">interest rates now we need to think back</text>
  <text start="413.169" dur="5.64">a little bit we saw this before we saw</text>
  <text start="415.569" dur="5.85">this in 2008 when interest rates started</text>
  <text start="418.809" dur="4.68">to rise what happened people were</text>
  <text start="421.419" dur="4.441">throwing in the towel people couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="423.489" dur="4.65">make ends meet and the entire system</text>
  <text start="425.86" dur="3.359">started to crumble apart and this is not</text>
  <text start="428.139" dur="4.32">the only reason there are many other</text>
  <text start="429.219" dur="7.141">reasons but we saw what absolutely</text>
  <text start="432.459" dur="6.66">happens now I&amp;#39;ve discussed in my other</text>
  <text start="436.36" dur="5.099">reports how all the retailers were</text>
  <text start="439.119" dur="4.41">channel stuffing the automobile</text>
  <text start="441.459" dur="4.2">manufacturers were channel stuffing and</text>
  <text start="443.529" dur="4.29">this was to make it look like gdp was</text>
  <text start="445.659" dur="3.78">going up and look at the great numbers</text>
  <text start="447.819" dur="4.11">oh but you know what it always comes</text>
  <text start="449.439" dur="4.38">back to bite you later on because what</text>
  <text start="451.929" dur="4.11">do the dealerships what do all the</text>
  <text start="453.819" dur="4.32">retail stores do with all this</text>
  <text start="456.039" dur="4.92">merchandise with all of this</text>
  <text start="458.139" dur="7.411">manufactured goods it just sits there</text>
  <text start="460.959" dur="6.45">and right now GM mrs. sales expectations</text>
  <text start="465.55" dur="3.869">of course the blaming the weather</text>
  <text start="467.409" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re blaming the Sun didn&amp;#39;t come up</text>
  <text start="469.419" dur="4.11">the right way the wind was blowing from</text>
  <text start="471.489" dur="5.34">the east to the west they have many many</text>
  <text start="473.529" dur="6.271">excuses and what really happened is that</text>
  <text start="476.829" dur="4.531">they manufactured a lot of automobiles</text>
  <text start="479.8" dur="3.419">they stuffed them into all the</text>
  <text start="481.36" dur="3.659">dealerships they have around 76 to 80</text>
  <text start="483.219" dur="3.99">days worth of automobiles and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="485.019" dur="3.57">crossing their fingers that the American</text>
  <text start="487.209" dur="3.69">people the middle class was going to</text>
  <text start="488.589" dur="4.771">come out and purchase like crazy this</text>
  <text start="490.899" dur="4.651">Christmas season but guess what when you</text>
  <text start="493.36" dur="3.679">have unemployment around no no no</text>
  <text start="495.55" dur="4.199">twenty-five thirty percent</text>
  <text start="497.039" dur="4.18">underemployment very high because most</text>
  <text start="499.749" dur="2.82">of the people lost their full-time jobs</text>
  <text start="501.219" dur="3.63">and now they have part-time jobs and</text>
  <text start="502.569" dur="3.57">since they have part-time jobs they</text>
  <text start="504.849" dur="3.06">don&amp;#39;t make the same amount of money they</text>
  <text start="506.139" dur="4.17">don&amp;#39;t have disposable income so they</text>
  <text start="507.909" dur="3.72">cannot go and spend the money and the</text>
  <text start="510.309" dur="2.67">last thing that people are going to do</text>
  <text start="511.629" dur="4.14">is say hey let&amp;#39;s go out and get a new</text>
  <text start="512.979" dur="6.24">car instead what they do is they go out</text>
  <text start="515.769" dur="6.12">and they purchase food they pay their</text>
  <text start="519.219" dur="7.081">rent they might pick up some clothing</text>
  <text start="521.889" dur="6.69">and that&amp;#39;s about it they pay their</text>
  <text start="526.3" dur="5.25">things they need to pay for right now</text>
  <text start="528.579" dur="5.551">they don&amp;#39;t think about buying gifts they</text>
  <text start="531.55" dur="4.649">don&amp;#39;t think about buying cars they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="534.13" dur="6.42">think about any of this and this is what</text>
  <text start="536.199" dur="5.851">is happening right now and reported for</text>
  <text start="540.55" dur="5.43">this us vehicles</text>
  <text start="542.05" dur="5.789">elles of about 230,000 vehicles was a</text>
  <text start="545.98" dur="4.62">decline of about six point three percent</text>
  <text start="547.839" dur="6.301">from 245,000 cars delivered a year</text>
  <text start="550.6" dur="5.6">earlier now of course the Fed the</text>
  <text start="554.14" dur="5.1">government they expected 1.5 sales</text>
  <text start="556.2" dur="5.53">increase in sales for the automobile</text>
  <text start="559.24" dur="4.95">manufacturers instead they had a 6.3</text>
  <text start="561.73" dur="5.13">decrease they are completely out of</text>
  <text start="564.19" dur="5.19">touch they have no idea what is going on</text>
  <text start="566.86" dur="4.62">or do they have an idea and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="569.38" dur="4.05">feeding us BS as they you normally do</text>
  <text start="571.48" dur="6.72">which I really believe what that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="573.43" dur="7.11">it is now the problem comes in is that</text>
  <text start="578.2" dur="5.55">all these dealerships from all the</text>
  <text start="580.54" dur="5.7">channels stuffing all these cars are</text>
  <text start="583.75" dur="6.72">sitting on the dealer the dealer&amp;#39;s lot</text>
  <text start="586.24" dur="6.39">and they can&amp;#39;t take any more cars they</text>
  <text start="590.47" dur="5.7">can&amp;#39;t sell them they can&amp;#39;t take more</text>
  <text start="592.63" dur="6.3">cars so what&amp;#39;s going to happen next</text>
  <text start="596.17" dur="4.47">month because they can&amp;#39;t produce more</text>
  <text start="598.93" dur="3.87">cars because they have all these cars on</text>
  <text start="600.64" dur="4.319">the lot does that mean GDP is going to</text>
  <text start="602.8" dur="4.349">start heading the in the opposite</text>
  <text start="604.959" dur="5.13">direction now if that heads in the</text>
  <text start="607.149" dur="5.43">opposite direction is the Fed going to</text>
  <text start="610.089" dur="4.981">go over wait a minute we can&amp;#39;t taper at</text>
  <text start="612.579" dur="6.45">this point we&amp;#39;ll have to find out and</text>
  <text start="615.07" dur="9.69">see now domestically vehicle sales are</text>
  <text start="619.029" dur="7.441">the lowest in 14 months and right now</text>
  <text start="624.76" dur="5.3">that it is the lowest since 2008</text>
  <text start="626.47" dur="5.369">actually and nearly every automobile</text>
  <text start="630.06" dur="3.46">automaker has reported</text>
  <text start="631.839" dur="5.161">lower-than-expected sales for the month</text>
  <text start="633.52" dur="6.12">of December relative to our forecast and</text>
  <text start="637" dur="5.82">the consensus and I just want to bring</text>
  <text start="639.64" dur="8.88">up one other point here and I just</text>

  <text start="809.74" dur="4.14">see they are trying to do whatever they</text>
  <text start="812.05" dur="3.57">can to get people in here and most of</text>
  <text start="813.88" dur="4.77">the people by using the arms will pay</text>

  <text start="827.98" dur="4.43">much higher this is what happened in</text>
  <text start="830.11" dur="6.96">2008 because people took out arms in</text>

  <text start="1269.19" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s going to be one of the worst you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1271.139" dur="6.15">ever seen and they need this to push the</text>
  <text start="1274.47" dur="4.289">gun bills forward and this is what</text>
  <text start="1277.289" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re using this is what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1278.759" dur="5.461">to use this event for but right now what</text>
  <text start="1281.309" dur="4.83">they are doing is that you can see the</text>
  <text start="1284.22" dur="6.35">most populated states in New York</text>
  <text start="1286.139" dur="7.38">California Illinois New Jersey</text>
  <text start="1290.57" dur="7">Washington they are all and I know</text>
  <text start="1293.519" dur="7.41">Washington&amp;#39;s not a state and and what</text>
  <text start="1297.57" dur="6.42">they&amp;#39;re doing is they are creating these</text>
  <text start="1300.929" dur="6">draconian laws which mimic the gun bill</text>
  <text start="1303.99" dur="5.069">that&amp;#39;s in the Senate and eighty percent</text>
  <text start="1306.929" dur="5.311">of the people are going to come down and</text>
  <text start="1309.059" dur="7.051">hand in their weapons because they have</text>
  <text start="1312.24" dur="6.149">a larger magazine then it that is</text>
  <text start="1316.11" dur="3.24">required by law so they hand them in so</text>
  <text start="1318.389" dur="2.821">they&amp;#39;re going to take care of the eighty</text>
  <text start="1319.35" dur="3.36">percent of the people the same things</text>
  <text start="1321.21" dur="3.78">going to happen on a federal level</text>
  <text start="1322.71" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re trying to get the law passed so</text>
  <text start="1324.99" dur="4.439">they can do this and hopefully what they</text>
  <text start="1327.69" dur="3.39">believe is going to happen and of course</text>
  <text start="1329.429" dur="4.5">it will eighty percent of the people</text>
  <text start="1331.08" dur="5.699">saying okay let me hand in my weapon</text>
  <text start="1333.929" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s I have you know 30 rounds in</text>
  <text start="1336.779" dur="3.931">here and I&amp;#39;m only allowed 10 or whatever</text>
  <text start="1338.759" dur="4.031">so I&amp;#39;m going to hand in this weapon here</text>
  <text start="1340.71" dur="4.54">because it can sustain more than</text>
  <text start="1342.79" dur="5.97">than what I have then they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1345.25" dur="5.91">go after the mentally ill and this goes</text>
  <text start="1348.76" dur="5.58">back to the veterans and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1351.16" dur="5.73">to hook this into the health care and it</text>
  <text start="1354.34" dur="4.32">will pop people&amp;#39;s names up and they will</text>
  <text start="1356.89" dur="3.06">be cold in the say I&amp;#39;m sorry you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1358.66" dur="3.44">have a weapon you can&amp;#39;t have a weapon</text>
  <text start="1359.95" dur="5.28">and that&amp;#39;s going to get probably another</text>
  <text start="1362.1" dur="5.44">ten percent of the people so now they</text>
  <text start="1365.23" dur="5.49">have about ten percent of the people to</text>
  <text start="1367.54" dur="5.66">worry about but don&amp;#39;t worry they will</text>
  <text start="1370.72" dur="5.55">take care of the rest of these people</text>
  <text start="1373.2" dur="5.65">because they are on list they know where</text>
  <text start="1376.27" dur="4.95">to define them and they will be coming</text>
  <text start="1378.85" dur="4.8">after those people and this is how they</text>
  <text start="1381.22" dur="5.37">are trying to work this out and we are</text>
  <text start="1383.65" dur="6.09">definitely going to see more executive</text>
  <text start="1386.59" dur="5.13">orders more laws until the false flag</text>
  <text start="1389.74" dur="5.88">event because what they always have is</text>
  <text start="1391.72" dur="7.89">they always have all of these laws all</text>
  <text start="1395.62" dur="7.11">of these bills ready to go as soon as an</text>
  <text start="1399.61" dur="4.95">event occurs and they just happen to say</text>
  <text start="1402.73" dur="3.99">huh look at that we just have this bill</text>
  <text start="1404.56" dur="4.29">sitting here waiting let&amp;#39;s pass it and</text>
  <text start="1406.72" dur="5.16">this is what they done I mean go back to</text>
  <text start="1408.85" dur="6.18">911 the Patriot Act was just sitting</text>
  <text start="1411.88" dur="7.47">there waiting for an event and as soon</text>
  <text start="1415.03" dur="5.82">as 911 happened boom Patriot Act and of</text>
  <text start="1419.35" dur="3.51">course the administration comes out and</text>
  <text start="1420.85" dur="4.56">says the administration is committed to</text>
  <text start="1422.86" dur="4.62">making sure that everyone that anyone</text>
  <text start="1425.41" dur="4.08">who may pose a danger to themselves or</text>
  <text start="1427.48" dur="4.02">others does not have access to a gun and</text>
  <text start="1429.49" dur="4.59">you have to remember most of these</text>
  <text start="1431.5" dur="5.82">people that are involved in these</text>
  <text start="1434.08" dur="5.01">shootings they didn&amp;#39;t even have a own a</text>
  <text start="1437.32" dur="7.02">gun that they got it from someplace else</text>
  <text start="1439.09" dur="7.41">so this has nothing to do with keeping</text>
  <text start="1444.34" dur="4.47">the public safe because i hate say it</text>
  <text start="1446.5" dur="5.07">most of these gun incidents were false</text>
  <text start="1448.81" dur="5.16">flag events they were planned out very</text>
  <text start="1451.57" dur="5.31">well and their merit many documentaries</text>
  <text start="1453.97" dur="5.4">on these events to show that these there</text>
  <text start="1456.88" dur="5.19">are so many anomalies in these events</text>
  <text start="1459.37" dur="6.54">that it doesn&amp;#39;t even make sense now we</text>
  <text start="1462.07" dur="6.96">understand that Obama had the NSA out</text>
  <text start="1465.91" dur="4.64">there and and he had a panel and we had</text>
  <text start="1469.03" dur="3.33">judges here saying it&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="1470.55" dur="3.16">unconstitutional and then we had a</text>
  <text start="1472.36" dur="2.9">federal judge come in say it was</text>
  <text start="1473.71" dur="3.98">constitutional</text>
  <text start="1475.26" dur="4.65">and what I say to this is the NSA the</text>
  <text start="1477.69" dur="6.09">government the central bankers are going</text>
  <text start="1479.91" dur="5.79">to do whatever they want I I mean they</text>
  <text start="1483.78" dur="4.56">spy on every single person they</text>
  <text start="1485.7" dur="5.37">blackmail people and right now the NSA</text>
  <text start="1488.34" dur="4.86">is building a quantum computer to break</text>
  <text start="1491.07" dur="6.93">all forms of a crip shin so they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1493.2" dur="6.51">you know tailoring back the NSA program</text>
  <text start="1498" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re moving this forward they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1499.71" dur="4.83">going to move this lightning speed</text>
  <text start="1501.54" dur="5.04">forward and again like I said before</text>
  <text start="1504.54" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re getting rid of all humans</text>
  <text start="1506.58" dur="3.99">replacing them with computers for their</text>
  <text start="1508.8" dur="3.54">administration staff so they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1510.57" dur="4.05">the problems with whistleblowers coming</text>
  <text start="1512.34" dur="3.9">out and right now this goes on to say</text>
  <text start="1514.62" dur="3.93">that the National Security Agency is</text>
  <text start="1516.24" dur="5.25">building a quantum computer capable of</text>
  <text start="1518.55" dur="4.71">breaking any encryption used to protect</text>
  <text start="1521.49" dur="3.99">the most vital records around the world</text>
  <text start="1523.26" dur="4.05">the US spy agency shown to have</text>
  <text start="1525.48" dur="4.35">deliberately weaken encryption standard</text>
  <text start="1527.31" dur="5.22">is seeking an advanced speed cryptologic</text>
  <text start="1529.83" dur="4.71">Lee useful quantum computer that can</text>
  <text start="1532.53" dur="3.87">bypass encryption that currently shields</text>
  <text start="1534.54" dur="4.68">global banking business medical and</text>
  <text start="1536.4" dur="4.59">government records so we can see what is</text>
  <text start="1539.22" dur="5.07">going on here and when I find very</text>
  <text start="1540.99" dur="7.56">interesting is that most of our senators</text>
  <text start="1544.29" dur="6.36">and congressmen in Washington they</text>
  <text start="1548.55" dur="3.96">really have no clue very few of them</text>
  <text start="1550.65" dur="3.48">have a clue of what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="1552.51" dur="4.02">because they&amp;#39;re really interested in</text>
  <text start="1554.13" dur="3.84">stuffing their pockets with money making</text>
  <text start="1556.53" dur="3.54">investment deals getting insider</text>
  <text start="1557.97" dur="5.25">information and becoming very very</text>
  <text start="1560.07" dur="5.7">wealthy on the backs of the people of</text>
  <text start="1563.22" dur="4.53">the United States and this is what they</text>
  <text start="1565.77" dur="5.64">are doing there so one senator says hey</text>
  <text start="1567.75" dur="5.46">you know I just started this and he</text>
  <text start="1571.41" dur="5.22">wants it now and this is senator Bernie</text>
  <text start="1573.21" dur="6.75">Sanders is the NSA spying on us too I</text>
  <text start="1576.63" dur="5.52">mean seriously yeah they&amp;#39;re spying on</text>
  <text start="1579.96" dur="3.93">all of you and when the time comes to</text>
  <text start="1582.15" dur="5.82">blackmail you that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1583.89" dur="6.63">to do and this goes on to say and in</text>
  <text start="1587.97" dur="5.52">order to be specific Sanders clarified</text>
  <text start="1590.52" dur="5.76">spying would include gathering metadata</text>
  <text start="1593.49" dur="4.32">on calls made from official or personal</text>
  <text start="1596.28" dur="4.83">phones content from the web sites</text>
  <text start="1597.81" dur="5.37">visited or email sent or collected any</text>
  <text start="1601.11" dur="3.6">other data from a third-party not made</text>
  <text start="1603.18" dur="4.47">available to the general public in</text>
  <text start="1604.71" dur="4.5">regular course of business and guess</text>
  <text start="1607.65" dur="3.509">what the NSA said</text>
  <text start="1609.21" dur="4.92">nothing the NSA did not immediately</text>
  <text start="1611.159" dur="5.041">return requests for comment and hours</text>
  <text start="1614.13" dur="3.09">after Sanders sent his letter the Office</text>
  <text start="1616.2" dur="3.78">of the Director of National Intelligence</text>
  <text start="1617.22" dur="4.77">announced that Pfizer court on Friday</text>
  <text start="1619.98" dur="6.24">renewed the domestic phone records bulk</text>
  <text start="1621.99" dur="9.21">collection for another 90 days the NSA</text>
  <text start="1626.22" dur="6.689">is spying on everybody because they need</text>
  <text start="1631.2" dur="4.62">to keep track of the American people</text>
  <text start="1632.909" dur="4.981">they need to find out who is investing</text>
  <text start="1635.82" dur="7.14">and where money is they need to</text>
  <text start="1637.89" dur="7.649">understand what each government official</text>
  <text start="1642.96" dur="4.26">is doing they need to know the dirt on</text>
  <text start="1645.539" dur="2.791">them so they can blackmail them just</text>
  <text start="1647.22" dur="3.329">like they have the dirt on federal</text>
  <text start="1648.33" dur="4.229">judges and this way they can pass laws</text>
  <text start="1650.549" dur="4.26">and say its constitutional when it</text>
  <text start="1652.559" dur="3.961">really isn&amp;#39;t and this is what it is</text>
  <text start="1654.809" dur="3.72">being used for they need to know what is</text>
  <text start="1656.52" dur="4.289">going on in the other countries around</text>
  <text start="1658.529" dur="3.931">the world and this is what it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1660.809" dur="3.99">about because we&amp;#39;re heading towards the</text>
  <text start="1662.46" dur="6.06">endgame people and they need to know</text>
  <text start="1664.799" dur="8.521">what is going on so they are ready for</text>
  <text start="1668.52" dur="7.289">what is coming now yesterday I reported</text>
  <text start="1673.32" dur="4.41">on North Korea and the propaganda of</text>
  <text start="1675.809" dur="3.75">them you know telling America they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1677.73" dur="3.96">going to strike with a nuclear weapon</text>
  <text start="1679.559" dur="3.541">and you know they have missiles that are</text>
  <text start="1681.69" dur="3.479">going to reach and they&amp;#39;re going to hit</text>
  <text start="1683.1" dur="4.92">South Korea and we always see this</text>
  <text start="1685.169" dur="4.591">propaganda come up whenever something is</text>
  <text start="1688.02" dur="4.529">happening last time we saw North Korea</text>
  <text start="1689.76" dur="5.029">it was because North Korea was making a</text>
  <text start="1692.549" dur="4.291">deal with Iran and then again it</text>
  <text start="1694.789" dur="4.541">happened when North Korea was making a</text>
  <text start="1696.84" dur="4.89">deal with Russia with a new rail system</text>
  <text start="1699.33" dur="3.63">and this time you know you see it all</text>
  <text start="1701.73" dur="3.84">over the news that North Korea is</text>
  <text start="1702.96" dur="4.949">threatening again now I was asking</text>
  <text start="1705.57" dur="5.55">myself why would they be threatening at</text>
  <text start="1707.909" dur="6.061">this point what why is the propaganda</text>
  <text start="1711.12" dur="5.21">coming out from the US and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1713.97" dur="4.98">saying all this and you know all of this</text>
  <text start="1716.33" dur="5.17">that the threats are coming and we</text>
  <text start="1718.95" dur="5.16">should be afraid of North Korea and then</text>
  <text start="1721.5" dur="4.94">if you look closer and you you know go</text>
  <text start="1724.11" dur="5.64">past all of this you see what happened</text>
  <text start="1726.44" dur="7.03">China will open up a high-speed rail</text>
  <text start="1729.75" dur="8.07">line to North Korea North Korea border</text>
  <text start="1733.47" dur="6.959">uh which they said on Thursday in the</text>
  <text start="1737.82" dur="5">state media in a sign that China remains</text>
  <text start="1740.429" dur="5.12">committed to boosting trade and economic</text>
  <text start="1742.82" dur="6.78">ties with the isolated nuclear-armed</text>
  <text start="1745.549" dur="7.171">state so what are they doing they are</text>
  <text start="1749.6" dur="6.209">using a new rail system to connect to</text>
  <text start="1752.72" dur="5.13">North Korea and to ship goods back and</text>
  <text start="1755.809" dur="5.97">forth and guess what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1757.85" dur="6.449">bypass the US dollar and this is the</text>
  <text start="1761.779" dur="5.071">real reason why these threats are always</text>
  <text start="1764.299" dur="4.62">coming out it is always against those</text>
  <text start="1766.85" dur="4.919">countries that are not using the US</text>
  <text start="1768.919" dur="5.13">dollar as the reserve currency those are</text>
  <text start="1771.769" dur="4.86">the enemies of the central bankers if</text>
  <text start="1774.049" dur="3.87">North Korea said hey you know what why</text>
  <text start="1776.629" dur="3.361">don&amp;#39;t you put a private western central</text>
  <text start="1777.919" dur="3.84">bank here and we&amp;#39;ll use the US dollar to</text>
  <text start="1779.99" dur="4.319">sell every piece of good that we have</text>
  <text start="1781.759" dur="5.431">here North Korea would all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="1784.309" dur="4.95">be a friend they wouldn&amp;#39;t be an enemy</text>
  <text start="1787.19" dur="4.8">anymore and everything would be</text>
  <text start="1789.259" dur="4.65">absolutely fine now we understand that</text>
  <text start="1791.99" dur="4.289">the US is losing control in the Middle</text>
  <text start="1793.909" dur="5.61">East and we understand that we in the</text>
  <text start="1796.279" dur="10.441">u.s. invaded Iraq and that was to get</text>
  <text start="1799.519" dur="12.961">rid of the leader in Iraq us and said</text>
  <text start="1806.72" dur="8.189">Saddam Hussein and what is happening</text>
  <text start="1812.48" dur="5.909">right now since the puppet government</text>
  <text start="1814.909" dur="5.911">has been placed into Iraq the people</text>
  <text start="1818.389" dur="4.441">there are rising up because they want</text>
  <text start="1820.82" dur="4.02">the central bankers out they want the</text>
  <text start="1822.83" dur="4.65">puppet government out and we are seeing</text>
  <text start="1824.84" dur="5.969">that the u.s. is actually losing control</text>
  <text start="1827.48" dur="6.24">there and Iraq might be sliding towards</text>
  <text start="1830.809" dur="5.131">a civil war and we&amp;#39;re seeing this happen</text>
  <text start="1833.72" dur="6.39">in many of the Middle East states</text>
  <text start="1835.94" dur="7.05">because the u.s. is trying to hold down</text>
  <text start="1840.11" dur="5.309">every single country and make each one</text>
  <text start="1842.99" dur="4.62">of these countries use the US dollar as</text>
  <text start="1845.419" dur="3.811">a reserve currency and this is why</text>
  <text start="1847.61" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re doing the drone strikes in all</text>
  <text start="1849.23" dur="4.5">these countries in Yemen they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1851.24" dur="7.26">in Pakistan they&amp;#39;re doing it in Turkey</text>
  <text start="1853.73" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re doing it in Lebanon Libya all</text>
  <text start="1858.5" dur="4.2">these countries they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="1860.24" dur="4.559">the people back so they can continually</text>
  <text start="1862.7" dur="4.589">operate the private western central bank</text>
  <text start="1864.799" dur="4.59">and sell all the natural resources using</text>
  <text start="1867.289" dur="3.421">the US dollar this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1908.78" dur="5.01">drill for oil off the Syrian coast and</text>

  <text start="1928.73" dur="5.16">are kind of in bed together right now</text>

  <text start="1933.89" dur="6.3">to Syria to fight Syria and Russia&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="1937.52" dur="5.43">that side giving weapons to Syria to</text>

  <text start="1942.95" dur="4.71">doesn&amp;#39;t like this yeah the US government</text>
  <text start="1945.89" dur="3.27">the central bankers because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1947.66" dur="5.03">another natural resource that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1949.16" dur="6.3">going to sell not using the US dollar</text>
  <text start="1952.69" dur="4.96">and of course this goes on to say the</text>
  <text start="1955.46" dur="5.28">contract will enter into effect</text>
  <text start="1957.65" dur="5.25">immediately despite US and European</text>
  <text start="1960.74" dur="5.79">sanctions against Syria so the sanctions</text>
  <text start="1962.9" dur="5.97">are not stopping this whatsoever they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1966.53" dur="4.83">going around it because this has nothing</text>

  <text start="1971.36" dur="4.89">bank it has to do with Russia and Syria</text>
  <text start="1973.88" dur="4.86">and they&amp;#39;re not using the US dollar so</text>
  <text start="1976.25" dur="4.86">they could care less about the sanctions</text>
  <text start="1978.74" dur="3.87">and of course the opposition central</text>
  <text start="1981.11" dur="3.48">bankers US government remain suspicious</text>
  <text start="1982.61" dur="5.34">of the deal which will be fully funded</text>
  <text start="1984.59" dur="5.31">by Russia which which they claim is the</text>

  <text start="1994.55" dur="6.36">sovereign country Assad is the president</text>
  <text start="1998.63" dur="4.2">and he could do pretty much whatever he</text>
  <text start="2000.91" dur="7.62">wants just like Obama does whatever he</text>
  <text start="2002.83" dur="9.69">wants now it was</text>
  <text start="2008.53" dur="7.56">the NSA appeared on 60 minutes and they</text>
  <text start="2012.52" dur="6.3">were talking about this bios attack that</text>
  <text start="2016.09" dur="4.62">you know they boarded and they were able</text>
  <text start="2018.82" dur="4.23">to save the American people from this</text>
  <text start="2020.71" dur="4.29">you know horrendous bios attack and then</text>
  <text start="2023.05" dur="5.25">it started I started to think about this</text>
  <text start="2025" dur="6.96">think about what they were saying at</text>
  <text start="2028.3" dur="6.42">that time that they were that China</text>
  <text start="2031.96" dur="6.48">that&amp;#39;s who they were blaming China was</text>
  <text start="2034.72" dur="10.55">able to get into every single person&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2038.44" dur="10.11">computer and you know create this bios</text>
  <text start="2045.27" dur="5.2">malware and everyone would be opening</text>
  <text start="2048.55" dur="4.41">emails or ever how they would get it and</text>
  <text start="2050.47" dur="5.85">it would bring all the pcs and servers</text>
  <text start="2052.96" dur="6.44">and everything down that it would be</text>
  <text start="2056.32" dur="6.359">very very difficult to do for China and</text>
  <text start="2059.4" dur="5.11">if you really think about it think about</text>
  <text start="2062.679" dur="5.541">what has come out in the last couple</text>
  <text start="2064.51" dur="8.399">days with the NSA they have intercepted</text>
  <text start="2068.22" dur="7.81">desktops desktops and laptops they</text>
  <text start="2072.909" dur="6.661">intercept them and they place additional</text>
  <text start="2076.03" dur="6.33">hardware in the system or they implanted</text>
  <text start="2079.57" dur="6.87">some type of spyware on the system now</text>
  <text start="2082.36" dur="7.559">they were doing this so this is how I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2086.44" dur="8.19">thinking they have the ability to create</text>
  <text start="2089.919" dur="7.411">this bios doomsday system that will</text>
  <text start="2094.63" dur="5.58">bring down all computers the financial</text>
  <text start="2097.33" dur="4.26">institutions the power grid because</text>
  <text start="2100.21" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re the ones who have been</text>
  <text start="2101.59" dur="4.17">intercepting all of these systems</text>
  <text start="2103.78" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;re the ones who have been making</text>
  <text start="2105.76" dur="7.47">deals with Microsoft with all these</text>
  <text start="2109.84" dur="6.24">other manufacturers of iphone with the</text>
  <text start="2113.23" dur="5.79">Android they all have back doors that</text>
  <text start="2116.08" dur="7.71">the NSA has paid them they have the</text>
  <text start="2119.02" dur="9.12">ability for a doomsday scenario think</text>
  <text start="2123.79" dur="6.8">about it for a second okay now we</text>
  <text start="2128.14" dur="5.73">realize and I&amp;#39;ve been saying this a lot</text>
  <text start="2130.59" dur="5.17">the corporate media and I mentioned this</text>
  <text start="2133.87" dur="5.37">yesterday there they are really</text>
  <text start="2135.76" dur="5.87">reporting a lot about terrorism and this</text>
  <text start="2139.24" dur="6.059">is starting to</text>
  <text start="2141.63" dur="5.53">make me worry right now more so than I</text>
  <text start="2145.299" dur="6.621">ever been because they are really</text>
  <text start="2147.16" dur="7.5">pushing terrorism forward and right now</text>
  <text start="2151.92" dur="4.919">during new years six suspected</text>

  <text start="2156.839" dur="5.76">police raided a near jakarta had planned</text>
  <text start="2160.749" dur="6.991">to carry out a string of attacks</text>
  <text start="2162.599" dur="10.17">targeted on US Embassy and basically</text>
  <text start="2167.74" dur="8.129">what happened was they they have</text>
  <text start="2172.769" dur="5.861">documents and paperwork where it reads</text>
  <text start="2175.869" dur="5.25">you know take your pistols holy warriors</text>
  <text start="2178.63" dur="5.07">and prepared to attack the US Embassy</text>
  <text start="2181.119" dur="4.5">Omar said reading from the document</text>
  <text start="2183.7" dur="4.049">during a press conference suicide</text>
  <text start="2185.619" dur="4.561">attacks were also planned he said and</text>
  <text start="2187.749" dur="4.651">they are really pushing these attacks</text>
  <text start="2190.18" dur="4.319">forward and they are letting us and</text>
  <text start="2192.4" dur="5.58">letting the American people see that</text>
  <text start="2194.499" dur="6">al-qaeda is coming after the US and now</text>
  <text start="2197.98" dur="4.26">we have representative PO saying that</text>
  <text start="2200.499" dur="3.961">al-qaeda is still a major threat now we</text>
  <text start="2202.24" dur="4.74">have Dianne Feinstein we have Peter King</text>
  <text start="2204.46" dur="5.73">we have Mike Rogers we have represented</text>
  <text start="2206.98" dur="6.75">a PO they&amp;#39;re all coming out and letting</text>
  <text start="2210.19" dur="6.059">us know that al-qaeda is a huge threat</text>
  <text start="2213.73" dur="5.099">and this goes on to say that over the</text>
  <text start="2216.249" dur="3.931">past year in my role as chairman of the</text>
  <text start="2218.829" dur="3.45">terrorism subcommittee of the House</text>
  <text start="2220.18" dur="4.02">Foreign Affairs Committee I&amp;#39;ve held a</text>
  <text start="2222.279" dur="4.23">multitude of hearings examining the</text>
  <text start="2224.2" dur="4.649">threat of al Qaeda and its affiliates</text>
  <text start="2226.509" dur="4.59">dozens of renowned terrorist experts and</text>
  <text start="2228.849" dur="4.381">Obama administration officials gave</text>
  <text start="2231.099" dur="4.111">their input on the current state of play</text>
  <text start="2233.23" dur="4.619">and after all that on left with</text>
  <text start="2235.21" dur="4.77">unfortunate conclusion that we are not</text>
  <text start="2237.849" dur="5.76">winning this war we don&amp;#39;t even have a</text>
  <text start="2239.98" dur="7.319">strategy and al-qaeda is coming for us</text>
  <text start="2243.609" dur="7.021">and this goes right on to say right now</text>
  <text start="2247.299" dur="5.911">al Qaeda controls or operates in more</text>
  <text start="2250.63" dur="5.31">territory around the globe than at any</text>
  <text start="2253.21" dur="7.47">point since its recreation its creation</text>
  <text start="2255.94" dur="7.53">by the CIA in 1988 today al-qaeda is a</text>
  <text start="2260.68" dur="5.359">complex adaptive and resilient</text>
  <text start="2263.47" dur="5.129">organization the administration success</text>
  <text start="2266.039" dur="6.191">against high-value targets has fostered</text>
  <text start="2268.599" dur="6.541">a false sense of security and Americans</text>
  <text start="2272.23" dur="7.85">are not safe because al Qaeda a</text>
  <text start="2275.14" dur="8.19">is coming and this makes me think that</text>
  <text start="2280.08" dur="6.22">this is a lead up to the event because</text>
  <text start="2283.33" dur="5.16">what is happening now well we have the</text>
  <text start="2286.3" dur="4.98">feds preparing for violence that are</text>
  <text start="2288.49" dur="4.98">targeting federal buildings and this was</text>
  <text start="2291.28" dur="4.86">reported on quite a while ago where they</text>
  <text start="2293.47" dur="5.52">were putting out bids to find security</text>
