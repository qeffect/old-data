  <text start="260.109" dur="4.68">leaders will not renegotiate withdrawal</text>
  <text start="262.389" dur="6.391">agreement to modify backstop the best</text>
  <text start="264.789" dur="6.901">way they will do is interpret it for</text>
  <text start="268.78" dur="4.859">Teresa May in a friendly way that will</text>
  <text start="271.69" dur="4.74">never secure Commons majority for the</text>
  <text start="273.639" dur="6.451">brexit plan so why is she bothering with</text>
  <text start="276.43" dur="4.739">any of this we have from Connor</text>
  <text start="280.09" dur="5.549">macmorrow</text>

  <text start="288.88" dur="5.219">he said the backstop necessary for the</text>
  <text start="291.13" dur="4.71">entire coherence of the agreement and it</text>
  <text start="294.099" dur="4.711">is necessary for Ireland iron</text>
  <text start="295.84" dur="7.32">we&amp;#39;ll never be left alone so it looks</text>
  <text start="298.81" dur="6.03">like right now is May is doing</text>
  <text start="303.16" dur="4.259">everything she possibly can to try to</text>
  <text start="304.84" dur="3.93">save this deal and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="307.419" dur="3.331">pushing forward that this is the best</text>
  <text start="308.77" dur="4.02">possible deal because this is the only</text>
  <text start="310.75" dur="5.16">one they&amp;#39;re putting forward and the EU</text>
  <text start="312.79" dur="7.11">is also threatening you better accept</text>
  <text start="315.91" dur="6.09">this or else whenever a government a</text>
  <text start="319.9" dur="5.79">central bank non elected leaders</text>
  <text start="322" dur="7.08">threaten people to accept something that</text>
  <text start="325.69" dur="6.09">means the deal is not good and hopefully</text>
  <text start="329.08" dur="6">and as we can see already they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="331.78" dur="7.02">trouble we see out in Australia they are</text>
  <text start="335.08" dur="6.87">warning of a severe housing collapse and</text>

  <text start="341.95" dur="4.29">debt to income ratio has ballooned to</text>
  <text start="344.29" dur="4.86">shocking levels over the past three</text>

  <text start="349.15" dur="5.91">the most overvalued cities in the world</text>
  <text start="352.229" dur="4.541">Australia&amp;#39;s regular regulators have been</text>
  <text start="355.06" dur="3.99">warned to prepare contingency plans for</text>
  <text start="356.77" dur="4.769">a severe collapse in the housing market</text>
  <text start="359.05" dur="4.14">now it&amp;#39;s not just Australia there are</text>
  <text start="361.539" dur="3.871">many other countries that are seeing the</text>
  <text start="363.19" dur="4.11">same exact thing they&amp;#39;re seeing in</text>
  <text start="365.41" dur="3.66">Vancouver they&amp;#39;re seeing it in many of</text>
  <text start="367.3" dur="3">the cities in Canada we&amp;#39;re seeing here</text>
  <text start="369.07" dur="2.25">in the United States of the seeing it</text>
  <text start="370.3" dur="6.21">throughout Europe</text>
  <text start="371.32" dur="9.03">remember the global economy was built on</text>
  <text start="376.51" dur="5.96">a central bank illusion and what they</text>
  <text start="380.35" dur="5.31">did was they made it seem like</text>
  <text start="382.47" dur="5.05">everything has been great and it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="385.66" dur="4.71">great and everything has been improving</text>
  <text start="387.52" dur="4.41">and all they&amp;#39;ve been doing is pushing up</text>
  <text start="390.37" dur="5.88">more and more debt blowing up more and</text>
  <text start="391.93" dur="8.549">more bubbles their plan was to shift</text>
  <text start="396.25" dur="7.38">everything and cover it up with war this</text>
  <text start="400.479" dur="5.791">is no longer the plan so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="403.63" dur="6.68">seeing right now is what it looks like</text>
  <text start="406.27" dur="6.209">without the event we&amp;#39;re watching the</text>
  <text start="410.31" dur="4.99">central bank system which is controlled</text>
  <text start="412.479" dur="6.571">by the Rothschilds we&amp;#39;re watching their</text>
  <text start="415.3" dur="7.02">system completely implode on itself this</text>
  <text start="419.05" dur="6.239">is why the central bankers are reporting</text>
  <text start="422.32" dur="6.39">and they&amp;#39;re are panicking that their</text>
  <text start="425.289" dur="4.501">independence is under threat they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="428.71" dur="3.78">worried about</text>
  <text start="429.79" dur="5.4">governments people waking up and</text>
  <text start="432.49" dur="6.18">starting to realize who is responsible</text>
  <text start="435.19" dur="5.82">for the global economy coming down and</text>
  <text start="438.67" dur="5.34">that is the central bank system because</text>
  <text start="441.01" dur="6.33">this is their system their system was</text>
  <text start="444.01" dur="6.92">never designed to last this long this is</text>
  <text start="447.34" dur="6.63">why they need an event to cover it up</text>
  <text start="450.93" dur="4.99">Trump stole this away from them are they</text>
  <text start="453.97" dur="2.31">trying to push this event of course they</text>
  <text start="455.92" dur="3.57">are</text>
  <text start="456.28" dur="7.37">and what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="459.49" dur="6.54">trying to maneuver some way somehow to</text>
  <text start="463.65" dur="5.53">regain control of the narrative now</text>
  <text start="466.03" dur="5.94">think about it control right now is with</text>
  <text start="469.18" dur="4.86">Trump he&amp;#39;s manipulated the same data</text>
  <text start="471.97" dur="4.61">that they&amp;#39;ve been in manipulating the</text>
  <text start="474.04" dur="5.46">economy looks great they can try to</text>
  <text start="476.58" dur="5.8">hammer at it to make it seem like the</text>
  <text start="479.5" dur="4.83">economy is not great but he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="482.38" dur="4.56">continually presenting the data to them</text>
  <text start="484.33" dur="4.53">saying well look at the data the data</text>
  <text start="486.94" dur="4.77">says three point percent unemployment</text>
  <text start="488.86" dur="4.38">look at the GDP numbers look at</text>
  <text start="491.71" dur="3.35">manufacturer look what&amp;#39;s happening here</text>
  <text start="493.24" dur="4.68">look at the number of job openings</text>
  <text start="495.06" dur="6.37">remember all this is manipulated they</text>
  <text start="497.92" dur="6.3">can&amp;#39;t counter that but they&amp;#39;re gonna try</text>
  <text start="501.43" dur="4.83">and this is what they were hoping for</text>
  <text start="504.22" dur="5.94">this is why this whole thing with</text>
  <text start="506.26" dur="8.73">wah-wah way and the arrest of men</text>
  <text start="510.16" dur="8.25">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to disrupt the deal</text>
  <text start="514.99" dur="4.77">with China and we&amp;#39;ll be talking about</text>
  <text start="518.41" dur="4.56">that in just a minute but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="519.76" dur="6.57">interesting is that is s this is</text>
  <text start="522.97" dur="6.99">Denmark&amp;#39;s cleaning giant this they</text>
  <text start="526.33" dur="7.95">employ a lot of people they are letting</text>
  <text start="529.96" dur="7.26">go 100,000 employees and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="534.28" dur="5.04">saying is that the emerging markets it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="537.22" dur="4.74">not worth it anymore but if you look at</text>
  <text start="539.32" dur="6.81">their numbers going all the way back to</text>
  <text start="541.96" dur="7.08">2011 2012 their employee numbers have</text>
  <text start="546.13" dur="5.19">been dropping ever since which tells us</text>
  <text start="549.04" dur="4.62">something something is wrong with the</text>
  <text start="551.32" dur="4.92">company yes they can use all other</text>
  <text start="553.66" dur="5.46">excuses but something is terribly wrong</text>
  <text start="556.24" dur="5.34">the IMF the central banks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="559.12" dur="3.81">continually out there saying that the</text>
  <text start="561.58" dur="4.11">economy the global</text>
  <text start="562.93" dur="6.39">economy the US economy it&amp;#39;s all going to</text>
  <text start="565.69" dur="6">slow because of tariffs Trump&amp;#39;s economic</text>
  <text start="569.32" dur="4.44">policies and the chief economist that</text>
  <text start="571.69" dur="4.41">the International Monetary Fund has been</text>
  <text start="573.76" dur="3.81">reporting this and he went on to say</text>
  <text start="576.1" dur="4.47">that for the rest of the world there</text>
  <text start="577.57" dur="6.51">seems to be some air coming out of the</text>
  <text start="580.57" dur="7.889">balloon that will come back and also</text>
  <text start="584.08" dur="7.199">affect the u.s. now we need to</text>
  <text start="588.459" dur="6.871">understand that they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="591.279" dur="5.461">their own illusion their own economy but</text>
  <text start="595.33" dur="2.52">they&amp;#39;re going to be trying but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="596.74" dur="3.599">gonna try to do is they&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="597.85" dur="6.179">blame this on Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="600.339" dur="5.821">that has always been their plan well if</text>
  <text start="604.029" dur="4.081">Trump wasn&amp;#39;t in there and Clinton was in</text>
  <text start="606.16" dur="3.929">there they&amp;#39;d just blame another country</text>
  <text start="608.11" dur="2.37">but they don&amp;#39;t have that option right</text>
  <text start="610.089" dur="3.351">now</text>
  <text start="610.48" dur="6.359">so Trump tweeted out the following today</text>
  <text start="613.44" dur="6.42">very productive conversations going on</text>
  <text start="616.839" dur="6.181">with China watch for some important</text>
  <text start="619.86" dur="6.22">announcements so this whole idea that</text>
  <text start="623.02" dur="6.78">the tariffs are going to bring down or</text>
  <text start="626.08" dur="7.11">slow the global economy this has just</text>
  <text start="629.8" dur="5.43">been countered by Trump and Trump is</text>
  <text start="633.19" dur="3.93">already telling us to watch for these</text>
  <text start="635.23" dur="4.62">important ausmus because think about it</text>
  <text start="637.12" dur="3.99">he&amp;#39;s used the manipulation that the</text>
  <text start="639.85" dur="3.63">central banks the deep state has been</text>

  <text start="643.48" dur="5.01">economy even though they try they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="646.18" dur="4.56">been blaming it on the tariffs now Trump</text>
  <text start="648.49" dur="6.15">is coming out with a deal with China and</text>
  <text start="650.74" dur="6.06">he&amp;#39;s countering that narrative but if</text>
  <text start="654.64" dur="3.84">you look at all the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="656.8" dur="4.88">outlets and you see what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="658.48" dur="5.19">you can see what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
