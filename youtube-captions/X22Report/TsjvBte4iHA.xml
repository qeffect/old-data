  <text start="317.93" dur="8.13">bubbles that are everywhere we see the</text>
  <text start="323.21" dur="6.15">bomb bubble it&amp;#39;s over 60 trillion in</text>
  <text start="326.06" dur="6.78">size this alone means it is more than</text>
  <text start="329.36" dur="6.3">five times the size of the US housing</text>
  <text start="332.84" dur="6.93">bubble I mean think about this for a</text>
  <text start="335.66" dur="6.36">second five times the size of the u.s.</text>
  <text start="339.77" dur="4.25">in the US housing bubble and we know</text>
  <text start="342.02" dur="7.079">what happened during the housing bubble</text>
  <text start="344.02" dur="8.92">how many people had hit and if we look</text>
  <text start="349.099" dur="6.991">at this this bond bubble this bubble is</text>
  <text start="352.94" dur="4.68">global in nature with thirty percent of</text>
  <text start="356.09" dur="5.04">global bond yields in negative territory</text>
  <text start="357.62" dur="6.93">and of course we can thank the central</text>
  <text start="361.13" dur="5.67">bank for this on top of all this because</text>
  <text start="364.55" dur="4.32">sovereign bonds are the supposed</text>
  <text start="366.8" dur="4.679">risk-free rate against which all other</text>
  <text start="368.87" dur="4.37">assets classes are based well when</text>
  <text start="371.479" dur="4.861">sovereign bonds are in a bubble</text>
  <text start="373.24" dur="7.54">everything is in a bubble corporate</text>
  <text start="376.34" dur="8.759">bonds muni bonds etc when we add all</text>
  <text start="380.78" dur="9.449">this up and we calculate it out the bomb</text>
  <text start="385.099" dur="8.151">bubble is now 199 trillion in size it is</text>
  <text start="390.229" dur="7.62">over two times the size of global gdp</text>
  <text start="393.25" dur="6.81">and we can see right now this is</text>
  <text start="397.849" dur="5.121">attached to the derivative market and</text>
  <text start="400.06" dur="7.079">the derivative market right now is</text>
  <text start="402.97" dur="8.62">around 555 trillion and derivatives</text>
  <text start="407.139" dur="9.101">trading based on bond yields this is the</text>
  <text start="411.59" dur="7.079">greatest bubble in history and we</text>
  <text start="416.24" dur="4.169">thought the subprime securities was a</text>
  <text start="418.669" dur="6.511">problem this is going to be worse</text>
  <text start="420.409" dur="9.511">remember how that unfolded people</text>
  <text start="425.18" dur="7.5">started a default domino fell</text>
  <text start="429.92" dur="4.68">in it that was it the same thing is</text>
  <text start="432.68" dur="5.76">going to happen here when that first</text>
  <text start="434.6" dur="8.64">domino falls the whole thing will come</text>
  <text start="438.44" dur="7.17">crashing down just like in 2008 now</text>
  <text start="443.24" dur="4.65">JPMorgan Chase is saying the odds of a</text>
  <text start="445.61" dur="4.98">recession well they&amp;#39;re up to thirty</text>
  <text start="447.89" dur="5.1">seven percent well I&amp;#39;m going to say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="450.59" dur="5.22">much much higher but the point of this</text>
  <text start="452.99" dur="5.94">is that they&amp;#39;re warning people now that</text>
  <text start="455.81" dur="5.25">something is about to happen there were</text>
  <text start="458.93" dur="4.98">warnings prior to two thousand eight</text>

  <text start="471.47" dur="4.53">slowly coming out with the warnings</text>
  <text start="473.3" dur="5.49">saying something&amp;#39;s about to happen at</text>
  <text start="476" dur="4.92">the same time the corporate media the US</text>
  <text start="478.79" dur="6.81">government the Fed is trying to convince</text>
  <text start="480.92" dur="7.05">everyone that everything is okay and we</text>
  <text start="485.6" dur="4.14">do get these types of messages because</text>
  <text start="487.97" dur="3.81">this way they can turn around and say no</text>
  <text start="489.74" dur="3.21">there were people out there saying that</text>
  <text start="491.78" dur="2.82">something was wrong we told you back</text>
  <text start="492.95" dur="2.94">then it was thirty-seven percent chance</text>
  <text start="494.6" dur="4.65">that this is going to go into recession</text>
  <text start="495.89" dur="6.45">well we&amp;#39;re already in a recession we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="499.25" dur="6.24">already collapsing look what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="502.34" dur="6.63">following things are rapidly falling</text>
  <text start="505.49" dur="7.02">apart and we can see right now Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="508.97" dur="6.12">push to get the TPP the TTIP well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="512.51" dur="5.78">failing right now German vice-chancellor</text>

  <text start="520.43" dur="4.35">the European Union and the United States</text>
  <text start="522.05" dur="5.43">well they&amp;#39;ve completely failed because</text>
  <text start="524.78" dur="5.82">the people in Europe they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="527.48" dur="5.64">be subject to American demands and we</text>
  <text start="530.6" dur="5.97">see people out there protesting say no</text>
  <text start="533.12" dur="4.83">to the TTIP they do not want it and it</text>
  <text start="536.57" dur="2.85">looks like the Senate right now is</text>
  <text start="537.95" dur="5.19">saying that they&amp;#39;re not even going to</text>
  <text start="539.42" dur="5.64">look at it this year and so far it looks</text>
  <text start="543.14" dur="4.55">like it&amp;#39;s not going to happen but we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="545.06" dur="5.82">have to watch that very very carefully</text>
  <text start="547.69" dur="6.85">now we&amp;#39;ve been talking about how this</text>
  <text start="550.88" dur="8.61">economy how our country is turning into</text>
  <text start="554.54" dur="6.39">a fascist country and John T Flynn who</text>
  <text start="559.49" dur="3.5">written a number of best-selling books</text>
  <text start="560.93" dur="8.3">back in the 1920s</text>
  <text start="562.99" dur="8.88">he reviewed history and Flynn sums up</text>
  <text start="569.23" dur="5.669">with a list of many different points of</text>
  <text start="571.87" dur="7.56">what he considers to be the main marks</text>
  <text start="574.899" dur="7.831">of a fascist state and many have his</text>
  <text start="579.43" dur="7.05">points fit right into what the United</text>
  <text start="582.73" dur="6.359">States is doing right now point one the</text>
  <text start="586.48" dur="4.83">government is totalitarian because it</text>
  <text start="589.089" dur="6.331">acknowledges no restraint on its powers</text>
  <text start="591.31" dur="6.6">yeah we can see that point to government</text>
  <text start="595.42" dur="4.65">is a de facto dictatorship based on the</text>
  <text start="597.91" dur="4.56">leadership principles well we&amp;#39;re not a</text>
  <text start="600.07" dur="5.07">full dictatorship but we can see the</text>
  <text start="602.47" dur="6.59">Obama administration the executive</text>
  <text start="605.14" dur="6.24">branch they&amp;#39;ve been doing things without</text>
  <text start="609.06" dur="6.45">consulting Congress without having</text>
  <text start="611.38" dur="6.45">Congress do things vote on certain bills</text>
  <text start="615.51" dur="4.6">where Obama says I&amp;#39;m just going to</text>
  <text start="617.83" dur="6.83">bypass Congress that is the beginning</text>
  <text start="620.11" dur="7.59">stages of a dictatorship point three</text>
  <text start="624.66" dur="6.34">government administers and capitalist</text>
  <text start="627.7" dur="5.18">systems with an immense bureaucracy well</text>
  <text start="631" dur="5.01">we definitely see that point for</text>
  <text start="632.88" dur="6.43">producers are organized into cartels in</text>
  <text start="636.01" dur="5.91">the way of syndicalism syndicalists is</text>
  <text start="639.31" dur="4.56">not usually how we think of our current</text>
  <text start="641.92" dur="5.01">economic structure but remember that</text>
  <text start="643.87" dur="6.51">syndicalism means economic control by</text>
  <text start="646.93" dur="6">the producers capitalism is different it</text>
  <text start="650.38" dur="4.17">places by virtue of market structures</text>
  <text start="652.93" dur="3.779">all control on the brands of the</text>
  <text start="654.55" dur="4.02">consumer in the case of the United</text>
  <text start="656.709" dur="4.611">States in the last three years we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="658.57" dur="5.88">seen giant banks pharmaceutical firms</text>
  <text start="661.32" dur="6.87">insurers car companies wall street banks</text>
  <text start="664.45" dur="6.54">brokerage houses and other corporations</text>
  <text start="668.19" dur="9.36">they&amp;#39;ve been drawing vast privileges at</text>
  <text start="670.99" dur="8.94">our expense so this fits in point five</text>
  <text start="677.55" dur="5.77">government sustains economic life</text>
  <text start="679.93" dur="5.58">through spending and borrowing I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="683.32" dur="5.579">even have to comment on this one point</text>
  <text start="685.51" dur="9.72">six militarism is a mainstay of</text>
  <text start="688.899" dur="10.171">government spending point seven</text>
  <text start="695.23" dur="6.4">military spending has imperialist aims</text>
  <text start="699.07" dur="7.8">so when we look at all these different</text>
  <text start="701.63" dur="10.52">points we can see the United States is</text>
  <text start="706.87" dur="7.9">fascist we are heading in that direction</text>
  <text start="712.15" dur="7">the majority to say ninety percent of</text>
  <text start="714.77" dur="8.58">the points we are there out in South</text>
  <text start="719.15" dur="6.03">Sudan we see one year after the United</text>
  <text start="723.35" dur="5.07">States government the UN brokered a</text>
  <text start="725.18" dur="5.01">peace deal South Sudan is worse off</text>
  <text start="728.42" dur="3.39">there&amp;#39;s more fighting there&amp;#39;s more war</text>
  <text start="730.19" dur="4.62">because you have to remember how the</text>
  <text start="731.81" dur="6.06">United States presents peace you do it</text>
  <text start="734.81" dur="6.33">our way or there&amp;#39;s going to be war that</text>
  <text start="737.87" dur="4.56">is how they push peace in all the</text>
  <text start="741.14" dur="4.8">different areas we have to remember in</text>
  <text start="742.43" dur="7.89">yemen just yesterday or friday i should</text>
  <text start="745.94" dur="6.2">say john kerry with saudi arabia</text>
