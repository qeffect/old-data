  <text start="61.34" dur="6.33">November 16th 2017 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="64.25" dur="6.78">the episode is deja vu we are seeing the</text>
  <text start="67.67" dur="5.61">same signs now as we saw back in 2008</text>
  <text start="71.03" dur="5.16">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="73.28" dur="5.67">financial news now we are starting to</text>
  <text start="76.19" dur="5.85">see a lot of the same exact signs that</text>
  <text start="78.95" dur="5.88">we saw in Prior recessions where the</text>
  <text start="82.04" dur="4.41">economy looked like it was doing very</text>
  <text start="84.83" dur="3.929">well and the whole thing just completely</text>
  <text start="86.45" dur="5.13">fell apart now we know the initial</text>
  <text start="88.759" dur="4.231">jobless claims they have been falling</text>
  <text start="91.58" dur="4.08">and falling declining declining</text>
  <text start="92.99" dur="6.03">declining and they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="95.66" dur="5.48">us that hey everyone has a job no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="99.02" dur="5.67">applying for any type of jobless claims</text>
  <text start="101.14" dur="8.11">everything is perfect now if we look</text>
  <text start="104.69" dur="9.3">back in time and we go back to 2007 to</text>
  <text start="109.25" dur="7.289">2008 we go back to 2000 to 2001 and we</text>
  <text start="113.99" dur="6.48">go back to each and every one of the</text>
  <text start="116.539" dur="6.72">recessions we see that there&amp;#39;s a pattern</text>
  <text start="120.47" dur="5.399">there&amp;#39;s a pattern where the initial</text>
  <text start="123.259" dur="4.89">jobless claims they&amp;#39;ve reached all-time</text>
  <text start="125.869" dur="5.941">lows and then all of a sudden people</text>
  <text start="128.149" dur="6.601">start to apply well we can see right now</text>
  <text start="131.81" dur="6.3">that we are back into the nineteen</text>
  <text start="134.75" dur="6.03">seventy area where initial jobless</text>
  <text start="138.11" dur="3.989">claims have dropped that far now this is</text>
  <text start="140.78" dur="3.24">because of all the manipulation that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="142.099" dur="4.231">been going on and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="144.02" dur="6">right now is that there are people now</text>
  <text start="146.33" dur="5.7">applying in fact there are over four</text>
  <text start="150.02" dur="4.53">percent more people on initial jobless</text>
  <text start="152.03" dur="6.06">claims than this year then this time</text>
  <text start="154.55" dur="7.4">last year and the question is because</text>
  <text start="158.09" dur="8.31">we&amp;#39;ve seen this before is the job market</text>
  <text start="161.95" dur="7.899">turning because every time when we see</text>
  <text start="166.4" dur="6.57">claims turn a recession follows and</text>
  <text start="169.849" dur="5.401">we&amp;#39;re starting to see a lot of very</text>
  <text start="172.97" dur="4.32">similar signs that we&amp;#39;ve seen back in</text>
  <text start="175.25" dur="4.83">other recessions here&amp;#39;s another sign</text>
  <text start="177.29" dur="6.18">that we&amp;#39;re seeing consumers right now</text>
  <text start="180.08" dur="6.57">are both confident and broke now the</text>
  <text start="183.47" dur="7.65">last time this happened guess what</text>
  <text start="186.65" dur="7.259">we entered a recession now when we look</text>
  <text start="191.12" dur="4.649">back in the past we can see when there</text>
  <text start="193.909" dur="4.47">are good times and they last for a very</text>
  <text start="195.769" dur="4.231">very long time which right now people</text>
  <text start="198.379" dur="3.541">have been thinking and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="200" dur="3.93">remember the past they only remember the</text>
  <text start="201.92" dur="3.959">last couple of years that everything is</text>
  <text start="203.93" dur="4.199">great in this economy because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="205.879" dur="3.36">brainwashed to believe this over and</text>
  <text start="208.129" dur="3.301">over the corporate media continually</text>
  <text start="209.239" dur="3.871">tells us everything&amp;#39;s great we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="211.43" dur="3.6">recovery this is what a recovery looks</text>
  <text start="213.11" dur="4.2">like this is what happens when there is</text>
  <text start="215.03" dur="5.61">a recovery the stock market goes up and</text>
  <text start="217.31" dur="5.789">people lose their jobs and what happens</text>
  <text start="220.64" dur="5.52">is that people well they start behaving</text>
  <text start="223.099" dur="6.961">in a way where they don&amp;#39;t really care</text>
  <text start="226.16" dur="7.02">that much anymore they stop saving they</text>
  <text start="230.06" dur="5.099">spend a little bit more and for those</text>
  <text start="233.18" dur="4.91">people who have lost their jobs this</text>
  <text start="235.159" dur="6.3">doesn&amp;#39;t happen at all and they become</text>
  <text start="238.09" dur="6.34">confident but they have no money we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="241.459" dur="4.53">starting to see this right now it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="244.43" dur="3.179">same thing that is happening and when we</text>
  <text start="245.989" dur="6.18">look at this we can see that this</text>
  <text start="247.609" dur="7.801">happened prior to 2001 it happened prior</text>
  <text start="252.169" dur="7.5">to 2008 and we are seeing this happen</text>
  <text start="255.41" dur="7.439">once again and this time it is worse</text>
  <text start="259.669" dur="8.281">than it was in 2006 and as nearly as bad</text>
  <text start="262.849" dur="7.681">as in 1999 so this is the second sign</text>
  <text start="267.95" dur="5.88">right now that we are headed for some</text>
  <text start="270.53" dur="5.19">trouble now if we go back to all the</text>
  <text start="273.83" dur="4.92">other reports we can see that there are</text>
  <text start="275.72" dur="5.819">other signs where the federal government</text>
  <text start="278.75" dur="5.4">is not receiving the same tax receipts</text>
  <text start="281.539" dur="4.38">of A&amp;#39;s as they once received because a</text>
  <text start="284.15" dur="3.42">lot more people have part-time jobs a</text>
  <text start="285.919" dur="3.091">lot of people have been losing their</text>
  <text start="287.57" dur="3.24">jobs and of course the unemployment</text>
  <text start="289.01" dur="3.51">numbers have been manipulated and this</text>
  <text start="290.81" dur="4.38">shows up in the tax receipts the</text>
  <text start="292.52" dur="6">corporate tax receipts revenue coming in</text>
  <text start="295.19" dur="5.159">to corporations not happening we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="298.52" dur="4.92">seeing many other indicators showing us</text>
  <text start="300.349" dur="5.991">that we are already in a recession we</text>
  <text start="303.44" dur="6.15">see retail imploding housing declining</text>
  <text start="306.34" dur="6.82">the GDP numbers how could they be real</text>
  <text start="309.59" dur="7.02">if 70% is made up of people purchasing</text>
  <text start="313.16" dur="6.09">things and retail is dying it makes no</text>
  <text start="316.61" dur="3.9">sense we see manufacturing is declining</text>
  <text start="319.25" dur="5.58">the Philly Fed right now</text>
  <text start="320.51" dur="8.22">well it looks like it is declining now</text>
  <text start="324.83" dur="5.49">of course the hope gauge is saying that</text>
  <text start="328.73" dur="3.54">God we hope things get better the</text>
  <text start="330.32" dur="5.19">outlook in six months looks great but</text>
  <text start="332.27" dur="5.22">the real hard data it is declining the</text>
  <text start="335.51" dur="5.49">Fed is out there telling us now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="337.49" dur="5.43">no inflation whatsoever there&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="341" dur="3.93">don&amp;#39;t have to worry about that we got it</text>
  <text start="342.92" dur="6.33">covered it&amp;#39;s very very low we&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="344.93" dur="8.76">to bring it up but this is a lie there</text>
  <text start="349.25" dur="6.6">is a huge amount of inflation and if you</text>
  <text start="353.69" dur="3.75">look over the past couple of years you</text>
  <text start="355.85" dur="3.78">can see how food prices have gone up</text>
  <text start="357.44" dur="3.9">college tuition has gone up housing</text>
  <text start="359.63" dur="4.68">prices have gone up automobiles have</text>
  <text start="361.34" dur="4.98">gone up if you look you can actually see</text>
  <text start="364.31" dur="4.08">it a lot of this inflation has been put</text>
  <text start="366.32" dur="6.06">into the stock market and many other</text>
  <text start="368.39" dur="8.4">areas and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="372.38" dur="7.17">that inflation is clocking in well above</text>
  <text start="376.79" dur="6.3">its 2% target indeed the New York Fed</text>
  <text start="379.55" dur="7.32">the uig inflation measure well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="383.09" dur="5.76">showing that we&amp;#39;re around 3% and we know</text>
  <text start="386.87" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s much much higher than that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="388.85" dur="5.4">conservative right now and the reason</text>
  <text start="392.18" dur="4.8">why we know that inflation is much</text>
  <text start="394.25" dur="5.61">higher because we can see other central</text>
  <text start="396.98" dur="4.77">banks in different countries where</text>
  <text start="399.86" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re hoarding gold where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="401.75" dur="5.82">purchasing a lot of gold Russia China</text>
  <text start="403.85" dur="7.23">India many other countries they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="407.57" dur="6.96">Germany they are buying gold because</text>
  <text start="411.08" dur="6.81">they know the inflation rate right now</text>
  <text start="414.53" dur="6.27">is much higher than is being reported</text>
  <text start="417.89" dur="6.3">and they&amp;#39;re taking advantage of this</text>
  <text start="420.8" dur="5.55">very low goal price and this is what</text>
  <text start="424.19" dur="6.57">they&amp;#39;re doing right now and we can see</text>
  <text start="426.35" dur="7.26">right now that the New York Fed well it</text>
  <text start="430.76" dur="5.07">looks like there&amp;#39;s other things going on</text>
  <text start="433.61" dur="4.83">beneath the surface where they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="435.83" dur="4.94">to convince everyone that yet</text>
  <text start="438.44" dur="4.98">inflation&amp;#39;s up a little bit but not much</text>
  <text start="440.77" dur="5.62">but we could see that it&amp;#39;s much higher</text>
  <text start="443.42" dur="6.96">than it really is right now we also see</text>
  <text start="446.39" dur="6.99">these three ominous signals which appear</text>
  <text start="450.38" dur="4.039">right before a financial crisis a</text>
  <text start="453.38" dur="4.679">recession</text>
  <text start="454.419" dur="7.99">now we have not seen a leadership</text>
  <text start="458.059" dur="7.5">reversal a Hindenburg omen and a Titanic</text>
  <text start="462.409" dur="6.06">syndrome signal appear simultaneously</text>
  <text start="465.559" dur="4.74">since just before the last financial</text>
  <text start="468.469" dur="3.63">crisis john Hussman</text>
  <text start="470.299" dur="5.79">pointed out that we&amp;#39;ve not seen this</text>
  <text start="472.099" dur="6.81">sort of threefold sell signal since just</text>
  <text start="476.089" dur="6.21">before the last financial crisis and he</text>
  <text start="478.909" dur="5.79">went on to say that since 2007 we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="482.299" dur="5.85">never seen this before I mean it</text>
  <text start="484.699" dur="6.39">happened before 1999 we happened right</text>
  <text start="488.149" dur="8.16">before 2008 and now we&amp;#39;re seeing it</text>
  <text start="491.089" dur="7.68">again the hindenburg omen this is a sell</text>
  <text start="496.309" dur="5.43">signal that occurs when the new york</text>
  <text start="498.769" dur="3.51">stock exchange hits new highs and new</text>
  <text start="501.739" dur="3.15">lows</text>
  <text start="502.279" dur="5.85">each exceed 2.8 percent of events plus</text>
  <text start="504.889" dur="6.63">declines on the same day on Tuesday they</text>
  <text start="508.129" dur="6.06">totaled more than 3% that the Titanic</text>
  <text start="511.519" dur="4.26">syndrome is a sell signal triggered</text>
  <text start="514.189" dur="3.9">while triggered when the new york stock</text>
  <text start="515.779" dur="5.971">exchange 52 we close out numbered</text>
  <text start="518.089" dur="6.451">52-week highs within seven days of an</text>
  <text start="521.75" dur="4.8">all-time high in equities stocks most</text>
  <text start="524.54" dur="5.76">recently hit a record on November 8th</text>
  <text start="526.55" dur="6.42">and we had a change in leadership we</text>
  <text start="530.3" dur="6.959">also see the flattening of the yoke</text>
  <text start="532.97" dur="6.869">curve and this is another signal that we</text>
  <text start="537.259" dur="4.38">are heading towards a recession now I</text>
  <text start="539.839" dur="5.821">believe the recession already started in</text>
  <text start="541.639" dur="6.591">2016 now again what happens is that when</text>
  <text start="545.66" dur="5.549">we enter a recession or depression</text>
  <text start="548.23" dur="4.12">months later the Fed the US government</text>
  <text start="551.209" dur="4.471">they go back in time and they say oh</text>
  <text start="552.35" dur="6.029">yeah by the way it started in 2016 but</text>
  <text start="555.68" dur="4.589">they don&amp;#39;t tell you this at the time</text>
  <text start="558.379" dur="3.51">it&amp;#39;s actually happening actually what</text>
  <text start="560.269" dur="4.701">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re covering it up</text>
  <text start="561.889" dur="6.961">completely and if the yield curve</text>
  <text start="564.97" dur="7.059">inverts well we are in a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="568.85" dur="7.739">trouble so what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is a</text>
  <text start="572.029" dur="8.521">lot of signals letting us know that</text>
  <text start="576.589" dur="7.141">something is coming down the road here</text>
  <text start="580.55" dur="6.509">and we&amp;#39;ve been tracking a lot of this</text>
  <text start="583.73" dur="4.049">information this is not just made up</text>
  <text start="587.059" dur="1.801">it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="587.779" dur="3.87">not something that we haven&amp;#39;t seen</text>
  <text start="588.86" dur="7.229">before we&amp;#39;ve seen all of these things</text>
  <text start="591.649" dur="6.48">happen before it is a pattern now I know</text>
  <text start="596.089" dur="4.23">the Fed they can manipulate the US</text>
  <text start="598.129" dur="5.851">government can manipulate the statistics</text>
  <text start="600.319" dur="6.75">they can make us believe that everything</text>
  <text start="603.98" dur="5.25">is fine they&amp;#39;ve done this before they</text>
  <text start="607.069" dur="3.601">did it back in 2008 hey hey the subprime</text>
  <text start="609.23" dur="3.81">securities are the triple-a don&amp;#39;t you</text>

  <text start="613.04" dur="5.57">you believe it</text>
  <text start="613.67" dur="7.849">what happens when people stop believing</text>
  <text start="618.61" dur="5.5">this is what we&amp;#39;re going to see happen</text>
  <text start="621.519" dur="5.38">once we go through this holiday season</text>
  <text start="624.11" dur="3.75">and retail is a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="626.899" dur="2.61">disaster</text>
