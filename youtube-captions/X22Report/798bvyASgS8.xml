  <text start="56.36" dur="5.7">x22 report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.7" dur="6.45">episode 1347 bee and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="62.06" dur="5.7">August 2nd 2017 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="65.15" dur="6">episode is that bad guys believe they</text>
  <text start="67.76" dur="5.67">have the upper hand wait for it let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="71.15" dur="4.68">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="73.43" dur="5.04">and geopolitical news now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="75.83" dur="5.37">seeing the same thing happened time and</text>
  <text start="78.47" dur="6.06">time again where the establishment the</text>
  <text start="81.2" dur="5.85">deep state the central bank those who</text>
  <text start="84.53" dur="5.79">want the truth to be hidden they have</text>
  <text start="87.05" dur="5.49">control yes of social media platforms</text>
  <text start="90.32" dur="5.159">they still have control of the corporate</text>
  <text start="92.54" dur="5.25">media and it looks like they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="95.479" dur="5.221">their agenda forward remember they still</text>
  <text start="97.79" dur="5.34">have control of all of these systems</text>
  <text start="100.7" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re still intertwined within the</text>
  <text start="103.13" dur="6.69">government and YouTube well they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="106.34" dur="7.65">battling this and there&amp;#39;s been pressure</text>
  <text start="109.82" dur="7.41">to basically censor those who have a</text>
  <text start="113.99" dur="4.65">different opinion of what the deep state</text>
  <text start="117.23" dur="2.7">might be pushing out there what the</text>
  <text start="118.64" dur="3.36">corporate media might be pushing out</text>
  <text start="119.93" dur="7.35">there and they&amp;#39;re very worried that</text>
  <text start="122" dur="11.04">people are listening to alternative</text>
  <text start="127.28" dur="8.4">media sites so YouTube set up rules just</text>
  <text start="133.04" dur="5.37">like every other social media platform</text>
  <text start="135.68" dur="4.32">and they set up you know rules the same</text>
  <text start="138.41" dur="3.329">listen you can talk about war you can</text>
  <text start="140" dur="3.48">talk about controversial things you</text>
  <text start="141.739" dur="4.321">can&amp;#39;t talk about pretty much anything</text>
  <text start="143.48" dur="4.89">you can show a cat video or you can show</text>
  <text start="146.06" dur="5.57">some type of funny video that&amp;#39;s a okay</text>
  <text start="148.37" dur="8.82">well now they&amp;#39;ve taken it a step further</text>
  <text start="151.63" dur="8.919">now content creators on YouTube those</text>
  <text start="157.19" dur="8.549">who follow all the sites rules they</text>
  <text start="160.549" dur="8.731">still may face censorship under new</text>
  <text start="165.739" dur="6.051">plans announced by Google now according</text>
  <text start="169.28" dur="4.86">to a post on YouTube&amp;#39;s official blog</text>
  <text start="171.79" dur="5.949">videos will be subject to the rule of</text>
  <text start="174.14" dur="6.929">the mob if enough users flag a video as</text>
  <text start="177.739" dur="5.401">hate speech or violent extremism YouTube</text>
  <text start="181.069" dur="5.551">may impose restrictions on the content</text>
  <text start="183.14" dur="7.59">even if it breaks none of the rules</text>
  <text start="186.62" dur="6.66">on YouTube now the question is are they</text>
  <text start="190.73" dur="5.339">going to review this or are they just</text>
  <text start="193.28" dur="7.65">going to go along with what everyone</text>
  <text start="196.069" dur="5.64">says so YouTube has rolled out a trusted</text>
  <text start="200.93" dur="4.25">flagger</text>
  <text start="201.709" dur="6">program in which 15 expert NGOs and</text>
  <text start="205.18" dur="5.86">institutions will help them identify</text>
  <text start="207.709" dur="6.691">hate speech extremism or maybe</text>
  <text start="211.04" dur="6.75">controversial topics they&amp;#39;ll review</text>
  <text start="214.4" dur="6.209">truth and if they feel like oh this is -</text>
  <text start="217.79" dur="4.71">truth worthy we can&amp;#39;t let this out there</text>
  <text start="220.609" dur="3.66">and it looks like what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="222.5" dur="4.079">be doing is they&amp;#39;re going to be taking</text>
  <text start="224.269" dur="5.071">down or I shouldn&amp;#39;t say taking down I</text>
  <text start="226.579" dur="5.19">should say hiding the videos will</text>
  <text start="229.34" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;ll never let anyone see them they</text>
  <text start="231.769" dur="5.94">will bury them so far even if you tried</text>
  <text start="235.01" dur="6.149">to search for them you will not find</text>
  <text start="237.709" dur="5.881">them so what they&amp;#39;re going to do they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="241.159" dur="4.741">be applying tougher treatment to videos</text>
  <text start="243.59" dur="5.1">that aren&amp;#39;t illegal but have been</text>
  <text start="245.9" dur="6.089">flagged by users as potential violations</text>
  <text start="248.69" dur="7.049">of their policies on hate speech and</text>
  <text start="251.989" dur="7.081">violent extremism if they find these</text>
  <text start="255.739" dur="5.641">videos don&amp;#39;t file a t&amp;#39; the policies but</text>
  <text start="259.07" dur="5.069">contain controversial religious or</text>
  <text start="261.38" dur="5.96">supremists or any other type of content</text>
  <text start="264.139" dur="8.011">they will be placed in a limited state</text>
  <text start="267.34" dur="8.29">the videos remain on YouTube behind of</text>
  <text start="272.15" dur="6.69">some type of wall where no one will see</text>
  <text start="275.63" dur="5.43">them they won&amp;#39;t be monetized you won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="278.84" dur="3.57">be able to comment on them you won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="281.06" dur="4.8">able to suggest them you will not be</text>
  <text start="282.41" dur="8.009">able to like them basically you&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="285.86" dur="5.94">set up in a limbo area where it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="290.419" dur="4.47">even matter because no one will ever see</text>
  <text start="291.8" dur="6.179">them this is the approach they are now</text>
  <text start="294.889" dur="6.391">taken to make sure that people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="297.979" dur="9.06">hear the truth of what is really going</text>
  <text start="301.28" dur="8.52">on this is how afraid they are now you</text>
  <text start="307.039" dur="4.861">can see that the deep state the</text>
  <text start="309.8" dur="4.41">corporate media they&amp;#39;re going to blame</text>
  <text start="311.9" dur="5.04">Trump for the economy coming down that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="314.21" dur="5.459">a given they&amp;#39;re already starting to</text>
  <text start="316.94" dur="3.6">blame Trump for what is happening in</text>
  <text start="319.669" dur="3.031">Obamacare</text>
  <text start="320.54" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re saying the rates are going up</text>
  <text start="322.7" dur="5.7">and it&amp;#39;s because of Trump because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="326.21" dur="4.02">seeing a lot of health insurance health</text>
  <text start="328.4" dur="5.49">insurance they are going to be raising</text>
  <text start="330.23" dur="6.72">the rates by 30% or more in 2018 now</text>
  <text start="333.89" dur="6.27">thank God we&amp;#39;ve been following this all</text>
  <text start="336.95" dur="4.52">along because those people who really</text>
  <text start="340.16" dur="3.57">haven&amp;#39;t been paying attention and just</text>
  <text start="341.47" dur="4">listen to this they&amp;#39;ll say oh my god</text>
  <text start="343.73" dur="4.14">look at this because what he did in</text>
  <text start="345.47" dur="3.42">Congress and what happened here and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="347.87" dur="5.04">not supporting it</text>
  <text start="348.89" dur="6.06">now rates are going up well no coops</text>
  <text start="352.91" dur="3.96">have been going bankrupt half of them</text>
  <text start="354.95" dur="4.04">are bankrupt right now we&amp;#39;ve lost</text>
  <text start="356.87" dur="8.49">billions and billions of taxpayers money</text>
  <text start="358.99" dur="10.18">we&amp;#39;ve seen premiums soar since Obama</text>
  <text start="365.36" dur="7.07">care came into existence so over the</text>
  <text start="369.17" dur="9.18">past four years premiums have soared on</text>
  <text start="372.43" dur="10.93">average around 113 percent or 30 percent</text>
  <text start="378.35" dur="7.17">a year so this is not anything new this</text>
  <text start="383.36" dur="5.73">is something that we&amp;#39;ve been tracking to</text>
  <text start="385.52" dur="5.4">make sure they couldn&amp;#39;t say oh it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="389.09" dur="4.14">because of this it&amp;#39;s almost like the</text>
  <text start="390.92" dur="4.68">retail industry well the retail is</text>
  <text start="393.23" dur="6.93">suffering right now because it snowed in</text>
  <text start="395.6" dur="8.54">one state it&amp;#39;s the same thing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="400.16" dur="7.41">doing here Trump came into office he</text>
  <text start="404.14" dur="5.89">doesn&amp;#39;t like Obamacare he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="407.57" dur="7.41">supporting Obamacare so he&amp;#39;s the reason</text>
  <text start="410.03" dur="8.43">why premiums are moving upward no again</text>
  <text start="414.98" dur="6.36">fake phony and false now what is</text>
  <text start="418.46" dur="5.64">happening here is the noose is</text>
  <text start="421.34" dur="3.78">tightening around the deep state is it</text>
  <text start="424.1" dur="3.93">really really tight where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="425.12" dur="4.95">choking no not yet but we can see</text>
  <text start="428.03" dur="5.58">everything is being set up right now</text>
  <text start="430.07" dur="6.6">where we can see that there&amp;#39;s a whole</text>
  <text start="433.61" dur="6.57">list of individuals that are now being</text>
  <text start="436.67" dur="6.78">investigated for unmasking we know that</text>
  <text start="440.18" dur="5.52">Obama has been spying on Trump and many</text>
  <text start="443.45" dur="5.13">others we see there are certain</text>
  <text start="445.7" dur="5.13">individuals like Ben Rhodes for example</text>
  <text start="448.58" dur="5.76">former aide to President Obama he is now</text>
  <text start="450.83" dur="6.839">a person of interest in the house until</text>
  <text start="454.34" dur="5.43">Mini&amp;#39;s unmasking investigation and there</text>
  <text start="457.669" dur="4.321">are of course the others we have Susan</text>
  <text start="459.77" dur="4.83">Rice we have John Brennan we have</text>
  <text start="461.99" dur="6.06">Samantha powers the ambassador to the UN</text>
  <text start="464.6" dur="5.64">and we can see right now there are going</text>
  <text start="468.05" dur="4.74">to be many many others that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="470.24" dur="5.19">going to be looking at because what is</text>
  <text start="472.79" dur="6">happening is the truth of the matter is</text>
  <text start="475.43" dur="6.06">coming out slowly but surely but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="478.79" dur="4.86">coming out now we see that Trump sign</text>
  <text start="481.49" dur="5.19">the sanctions bill against Russia which</text>
  <text start="483.65" dur="5.519">at this point there weren&amp;#39;t many options</text>
  <text start="486.68" dur="4.08">yes he could have vetoed it but it was</text>
  <text start="489.169" dur="3.5">veto proof so it wouldn&amp;#39;t make a</text>
  <text start="490.76" dur="4.98">difference yes it would have shown</text>
  <text start="492.669" dur="4.451">everyone that he was completely against</text>
  <text start="495.74" dur="2.67">this and maybe he should have done this</text>
  <text start="497.12" dur="4.71">maybe that would have been the right</text>
  <text start="498.41" dur="6.87">thing to do but what he was trying to do</text>
  <text start="501.83" dur="6">is he was trying to show that he was</text>
  <text start="505.28" dur="4.109">part of the party which I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="507.83" dur="4.08">personally agree with I think you know</text>
  <text start="509.389" dur="4.441">something the party&amp;#39;s not with you the</text>
  <text start="511.91" dur="4.74">Republican Party the Democratic Party</text>
  <text start="513.83" dur="4.949">you&amp;#39;re a lone wolf right now it&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="516.65" dur="4.35">to take charge and forget about all of</text>
  <text start="518.779" dur="3.69">them because they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="521" dur="3.779">working with you whatsoever I think</text>
  <text start="522.469" dur="6.841">maybe in his mind he thinks that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="524.779" dur="7.321">trying to sign it and have a national</text>
  <text start="529.31" dur="5.31">type of unity where he can show everyone</text>
  <text start="532.1" dur="5.489">look yes I&amp;#39;m with you I think it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="534.62" dur="6.089">waste of time personally now he went on</text>
  <text start="537.589" dur="4.791">to say that the legislation included a</text>
  <text start="540.709" dur="4.561">number of clearly unconstitutional</text>
  <text start="542.38" dur="4.57">provisions which encroaches on the</text>
  <text start="545.27" dur="4.74">executive branch&amp;#39;s authority to</text>
  <text start="546.95" dur="4.62">negotiate something he blamed on a hasty</text>
  <text start="550.01" dur="5.579">manner in which the bill was put</text>
  <text start="551.57" dur="8.22">together now I think he&amp;#39;s building this</text>
  <text start="555.589" dur="6.87">up to show that he might not follow the</text>
  <text start="559.79" dur="5.76">entire sanction bill all the way through</text>
  <text start="562.459" dur="5.25">he signed it and now he can say you know</text>
  <text start="565.55" dur="4.95">something through executive order I</text>
  <text start="567.709" dur="5.041">don&amp;#39;t believe this is constitutional so</text>
  <text start="570.5" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re not going to follow that I think</text>
  <text start="572.75" dur="4.83">this is where we are headed with this</text>
  <text start="575" dur="5.52">and we&amp;#39;ll have to wait to see what does</text>
  <text start="577.58" dur="6.03">occur now what is very interesting is</text>
  <text start="580.52" dur="5.7">that Rex Tillerson stated that both he</text>
  <text start="583.61" dur="4.57">and Donald Trump were unhappy about the</text>
  <text start="586.22" dur="3.79">bill but would try their utmost</text>
  <text start="588.18" dur="5.73">work around it and pursue their versions</text>
  <text start="590.01" dur="7.769">of improved relations with Moscow now</text>
  <text start="593.91" dur="5.28">their version of what they believe the</text>
  <text start="597.779" dur="4.351">sanctions bill is and we discussed this</text>
  <text start="599.19" dur="5.43">before where I think he&amp;#39;s might be</text>
  <text start="602.13" dur="4.2">maneuvering around what they put in the</text>
  <text start="604.62" dur="4.26">bill maybe he doesn&amp;#39;t follow everything</text>
  <text start="606.33" dur="4.08">now Tillerson is out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="608.88" dur="4.35">saying listen the relations between the</text>
  <text start="610.41" dur="4.79">US and Russia they&amp;#39;re under considerable</text>
  <text start="613.23" dur="5.07">stress so he&amp;#39;s going to meet with Lavrov</text>
  <text start="615.2" dur="4.27">to try to calm everything down because</text>
  <text start="618.3" dur="3.659">we can see what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="619.47" dur="5.19">and again this is all part of the</text>
  <text start="621.959" dur="4.111">process nothing is black and white god</text>
  <text start="624.66" dur="4.56">it would be great if it was black and</text>
  <text start="626.07" dur="6.45">white but it isn&amp;#39;t we have powers on all</text>
  <text start="629.22" dur="5.52">sides trying to push their agenda right</text>
  <text start="632.52" dur="4.77">now and we have nikki Haley out there</text>
  <text start="634.74" dur="4.38">the US ambassador to the UN where she is</text>
  <text start="637.29" dur="3.93">out there saying listen there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="639.12" dur="4.05">reason to talk to North Korea we have</text>
  <text start="641.22" dur="4.47">Lindsey Graham saying that Trump already</text>
  <text start="643.17" dur="5.13">has a battle plan to go into North Korea</text>
  <text start="645.69" dur="4.8">and this would be absolutely ridiculous</text>
  <text start="648.3" dur="3.87">to use and do I think he&amp;#39;s going to do</text>
  <text start="650.49" dur="3.78">it absolutely not because if this was</text>
  <text start="652.17" dur="4.44">truly the case he&amp;#39;d be in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="654.27" dur="5.97">bringing more troops into there he&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="656.61" dur="6.12">bringing tons of troops into Syria what</text>
  <text start="660.24" dur="4.86">would be the purpose to go into North</text>
  <text start="662.73" dur="4.25">Korea at this point and start a war</text>
  <text start="665.1" dur="5.87">because we know what&amp;#39;s on the other side</text>
  <text start="666.98" dur="6.7">China and Russia just like in Syria</text>
  <text start="670.97" dur="5.5">China and Russia are on the other side</text>
  <text start="673.68" dur="6.36">this would make no sense whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="676.47" dur="5.369">it looks like Trump and Tillerson it</text>
  <text start="680.04" dur="4.68">looks like they&amp;#39;re playing bad cop good</text>
  <text start="681.839" dur="5.94">cop here because Trump is saying and</text>
  <text start="684.72" dur="5.73">he&amp;#39;s talking very sternly about North</text>
  <text start="687.779" dur="4.891">Korea and how this is ridiculous and</text>
  <text start="690.45" dur="5.91">they shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing this and this is</text>
  <text start="692.67" dur="6.659">to bring you know everyone with him to</text>
  <text start="696.36" dur="5.79">try to win people over then we have</text>
  <text start="699.329" dur="5.521">Tillerson where he&amp;#39;s offering a</text>
  <text start="702.15" dur="5.249">different perspective on it and he</text>
  <text start="704.85" dur="4.95">stated the following we do not seek</text>

  <text start="726.56" dur="5.35">we&amp;#39;ll begin to understand that and we</text>
  <text start="729.54" dur="6.42">would like to sit and have a dialogue</text>
  <text start="731.91" dur="7.77">with North Korea now at the same time</text>
  <text start="735.96" dur="6.42">this is happening we have both China and</text>

  <text start="777.78" dur="5">crippling sanctions on North Korea which</text>
  <text start="779.97" dur="7.47">could cause deprivation among civilians</text>
  <text start="782.78" dur="7.75">so we see right now there is a push to</text>
  <text start="787.44" dur="7.5">have peace in the area just like Russia</text>
  <text start="790.53" dur="7.11">was pushing peace in Ukraine Russia was</text>

  <text start="799.26" dur="3.42">fight the terrorist groups and we knew</text>
  <text start="801.27" dur="3.18">this wasn&amp;#39;t going to work because the</text>

  <text start="825.81" dur="6.36">state individuals in the Pentagon they</text>
  <text start="828.21" dur="6.6">decided to have a test of an ICBM they</text>

  <text start="882.12" dur="5.31">to stomp</text>
  <text start="883.579" dur="5.5">now China they&amp;#39;ve officially opened</text>
  <text start="887.43" dur="4.17">their first overseas naval base in</text>
