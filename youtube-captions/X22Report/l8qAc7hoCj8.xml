  <text start="56.76" dur="8.1">when he to report my name is David 1301</text>
  <text start="60.9" dur="6.33">BN today&amp;#39;s date is June 8th 2017 and the</text>
  <text start="64.86" dur="6.09">title of the episode is it&amp;#39;s all coming</text>
  <text start="67.23" dur="6">apart this is where it gets scary let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="70.95" dur="5.37">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="73.23" dur="6.51">and geopolitical news now call me was</text>
  <text start="76.32" dur="4.95">giving testimony today and I believe the</text>
  <text start="79.74" dur="3.45">corporate media thought that he was just</text>
  <text start="81.27" dur="3.69">going to come out and say that yes Trump</text>
  <text start="83.19" dur="4.11">was obstructing justice yes there was a</text>
  <text start="84.96" dur="5.43">Russian investigation going on and yes</text>
  <text start="87.3" dur="5.55">there was Russian collusion and none of</text>
  <text start="90.39" dur="5.07">this was said whatsoever actually the</text>
  <text start="92.85" dur="4.5">opposite was said and it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="95.46" dur="4.2">look like Comey has gotten himself into</text>
  <text start="97.35" dur="4.59">a little bit of trouble and a lot of the</text>
  <text start="99.66" dur="5.13">information that was coming out well it</text>
  <text start="101.94" dur="3.929">doesn&amp;#39;t Drive in what really happened</text>
  <text start="104.79" dur="4.02">especially when you look at the</text>
  <text start="105.869" dur="5.941">timelines now let&amp;#39;s start off with the</text>
  <text start="108.81" dur="6.74">memo because James Comey he wrote a memo</text>
  <text start="111.81" dur="6.63">it was leaked to the New York Times and</text>
  <text start="115.55" dur="6.25">James Comey said that he was concerned</text>
  <text start="118.44" dur="5.94">that Trump would lie about the nature of</text>
  <text start="121.8" dur="6">their meeting which is why he kept a</text>
  <text start="124.38" dur="5.489">written record of their meetings and he</text>
  <text start="127.8" dur="4.73">believes anything that he wrote down is</text>
  <text start="129.869" dur="6.841">personal to him even though it was in</text>
  <text start="132.53" dur="7.81">the FBI&amp;#39;s office and he was working as</text>
  <text start="136.71" dur="6.87">an FBI agent at the time which means</text>
  <text start="140.34" dur="6.15">it&amp;#39;s not really personal to him because</text>
  <text start="143.58" dur="5.31">it was in the framework of working in</text>
  <text start="146.49" dur="5.01">government so really it belongs to the</text>
  <text start="148.89" dur="6.42">people but the question was asked of him</text>
  <text start="151.5" dur="5.61">well how did this memo how did it leak</text>
  <text start="155.31" dur="4.44">out how did it get to the New York Times</text>
  <text start="157.11" dur="4.98">did you actually read it to the New York</text>
  <text start="159.75" dur="5.61">Times over the phone and he said no it</text>
  <text start="162.09" dur="5.52">wasn&amp;#39;t me I gave it to my friend Daniel</text>
  <text start="165.36" dur="6.24">Richmond a Columbia Law School professor</text>
  <text start="167.61" dur="6.99">and he transmitted it to the New York</text>
  <text start="171.6" dur="5.07">Times through the phone now the New York</text>
  <text start="174.6" dur="6.42">Times never received this memo it was</text>
  <text start="176.67" dur="6.629">read to them so we see right now he</text>
  <text start="181.02" dur="4.499">leaked information of a private</text>
  <text start="183.299" dur="3.601">conversation with the President of the</text>
  <text start="185.519" dur="5.421">United States</text>
  <text start="186.9" dur="6.869">and Trump&amp;#39;s lawyer mark Casa wits is</text>
  <text start="190.94" dur="6.22">calling Comey out on this and saying</text>
  <text start="193.769" dur="5.97">that well the timeline of what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="197.16" dur="5.579">saying really doesn&amp;#39;t make sense about</text>
  <text start="199.739" dur="4.86">the leaked memo he went on to say the</text>
  <text start="202.739" dur="6.121">leaks of this privileged information</text>
  <text start="204.599" dur="6.301">began no later than March 2017 when</text>
  <text start="208.86" dur="4.5">friends of mr. Comey have stated he</text>
  <text start="210.9" dur="3.75">disclosed to them the conversations he</text>
  <text start="213.36" dur="4.53">had with the president during their</text>
  <text start="214.65" dur="6.899">January 27th 2017 dinner and February</text>
  <text start="217.89" dur="6.36">14th 2017 White House meeting today mr.</text>
  <text start="221.549" dur="5.431">Comey admitted that he leaked to friends</text>
  <text start="224.25" dur="4.98">his purported memos of this privileged</text>
  <text start="226.98" dur="5.46">conversations one of which he testified</text>
  <text start="229.23" dur="5.55">was classified he also testified that</text>
  <text start="232.44" dur="4.2">immediately after he was terminated he</text>
  <text start="234.78" dur="4.2">authorized his friends to lead the</text>
  <text start="236.64" dur="4.349">content of these memos to the press in</text>
  <text start="238.98" dur="3.39">order to prompt the appointment of a</text>
  <text start="240.989" dur="4.681">special counsel</text>
  <text start="242.37" dur="5.04">now although mr. Comey testified he only</text>
  <text start="245.67" dur="4.59">leaked the memos in response to the</text>
  <text start="247.41" dur="5.22">tweet the public record reveals that the</text>
  <text start="250.26" dur="5.64">New York Times was quoting from these</text>
  <text start="252.63" dur="7.979">memos the day before the reference tweet</text>
  <text start="255.9" dur="8.19">which seems that Comey used this to</text>
  <text start="260.609" dur="8.06">retaliate against Trump for firing him</text>
  <text start="264.09" dur="8.34">so basically he leaked information and</text>
  <text start="268.669" dur="6.22">the question is having called Trump a</text>
  <text start="272.43" dur="5.88">liar did call me just get caught in a</text>
  <text start="274.889" dur="6.21">even bigger lie now let&amp;#39;s take this a</text>
  <text start="278.31" dur="5.419">little bit further Jim Risch was asking</text>
  <text start="281.099" dur="4.861">call me many different questions and</text>
  <text start="283.729" dur="4.75">there was a story out in The New York</text>
  <text start="285.96" dur="5.579">Times that Trump was colluding with</text>
  <text start="288.479" dur="5.221">Russia and of course then it spread to</text>
  <text start="291.539" dur="4.5">all the other news agencies and everyone</text>
  <text start="293.7" dur="7.8">believed that Trump was colluding with</text>
  <text start="296.039" dur="8.1">Russia and Jim Risch said to Comey okay</text>
  <text start="301.5" dur="4.83">so again so the American people can</text>
  <text start="304.139" dur="4.53">understand this the report by the New</text>
  <text start="306.33" dur="5.07">York Times that was not true</text>
  <text start="308.669" dur="3.961">is that a fair statement call me said it</text>
  <text start="311.4" dur="4.29">was not true</text>
  <text start="312.63" dur="5.94">again all of you know this but maybe the</text>
  <text start="315.69" dur="4.82">American people don&amp;#39;t so that whole</text>
  <text start="318.57" dur="4.82">story in the corporate media</text>
  <text start="320.51" dur="5.94">was completely false now let&amp;#39;s move on</text>
  <text start="323.39" dur="4.83">to the obstruction of justice now during</text>
  <text start="326.45" dur="4.8">the firing of Comey</text>
  <text start="328.22" dur="5.7">there was no Russian investigation on</text>
  <text start="331.25" dur="5.46">Trump actually Trump said you know what</text>
  <text start="333.92" dur="5.1">why don&amp;#39;t you investigate everyone to</text>
  <text start="336.71" dur="5.76">find out if there is anything going on</text>
  <text start="339.02" dur="6.09">but there was no investigation on Trump</text>
  <text start="342.47" dur="4.98">right now so he didn&amp;#39;t do it to</text>
  <text start="345.11" dur="4.86">basically stop the investigation because</text>
  <text start="347.45" dur="3.96">there was no investigation and Comey is</text>
  <text start="349.97" dur="4.05">not the only one investigating they have</text>
  <text start="351.41" dur="5.25">teams of people that do this so getting</text>
  <text start="354.02" dur="5.37">rid of one person does not stop an</text>
  <text start="356.66" dur="4.92">investigation but rich was out there and</text>
  <text start="359.39" dur="4.86">he went on to say boy you nailed this</text>
  <text start="361.58" dur="5.28">down on page five paragraph three you</text>
  <text start="364.25" dur="4.98">put this in quotes words matter you</text>
  <text start="366.86" dur="4.32">wrote down the word so we could have all</text>
  <text start="369.23" dur="4.41">the words in front of us now there are</text>
  <text start="371.18" dur="5.4">28 words that are there in quotes and it</text>
  <text start="373.64" dur="5.04">said I hope this is the president</text>
  <text start="376.58" dur="4.53">speaking I hope you can see your way</text>
  <text start="378.68" dur="6.09">clear to letting this go to letting</text>
  <text start="381.11" dur="5.67">Flynn go I hope you can let this go now</text>
  <text start="384.77" dur="4.23">those are his exact words is that</text>
  <text start="386.78" dur="5.64">correct Comey said yes those are his</text>
  <text start="389" dur="6.15">exact words rich said and you wrote them</text>
  <text start="392.42" dur="5.25">here and you put them in quotes Comey</text>
  <text start="395.15" dur="5.64">said correct rich said thank you for</text>
  <text start="397.67" dur="7.68">that he did not direct you to let it go</text>
  <text start="400.79" dur="7.68">Comey not in his words no wrists said he</text>
  <text start="405.35" dur="6.21">did not order you to let it go Comey</text>
  <text start="408.47" dur="7.11">again those words are not in order and</text>
  <text start="411.56" dur="6.33">rich went on to say now like me you</text>
  <text start="415.58" dur="4.92">probably did hundreds of cases maybe</text>
  <text start="417.89" dur="4.71">thousands of cases charging people with</text>
  <text start="420.5" dur="3.9">criminal offenses and of course you have</text>
  <text start="422.6" dur="4.53">knowledge of thousands of cases out</text>
  <text start="424.4" dur="5.01">there where people had been charged do</text>
  <text start="427.13" dur="3.69">you know of any case where a person has</text>
  <text start="429.41" dur="3.69">been charged for obstruction of justice</text>
  <text start="430.82" dur="4.35">that for the matter of any other</text>
  <text start="433.1" dur="5.49">criminal offense where they said or</text>
  <text start="435.17" dur="3.69">thought they hoped for an outcome call</text>
  <text start="438.59" dur="2.49">me</text>
  <text start="438.86" dur="5.07">I don&amp;#39;t know well enough to answer and</text>
  <text start="441.08" dur="6.78">the reason I keep saying his words is I</text>
  <text start="443.93" dur="6.6">took it as a direction we said you may</text>
  <text start="447.86" dur="4.2">have taken it as a direction but that is</text>
  <text start="450.53" dur="3.66">not what he said</text>
  <text start="452.06" dur="5.28">he said I hope</text>
  <text start="454.19" dur="5.25">you don&amp;#39;t know of anyone who has ever</text>
  <text start="457.34" dur="5.19">been charged for hoping something is</text>
  <text start="459.44" dur="6.69">that a fair statement Comey says I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="462.53" dur="4.77">as I sit here now of course the</text>
  <text start="466.13" dur="2.79">corporate media is not going to be</text>
  <text start="467.3" dur="3.99">really reporting on this part of the</text>
  <text start="468.92" dur="5.37">conversation because they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="471.29" dur="5.76">bring this part up because we need to</text>
  <text start="474.29" dur="5.43">remember this is coming from Comey side</text>
  <text start="477.05" dur="6.54">Trump didn&amp;#39;t testify to this so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="479.72" dur="7.44">only what Comey is telling the Senate</text>
  <text start="483.59" dur="6.75">panel and he put together a statement</text>
  <text start="487.16" dur="6.24">and he put things into quotes of what he</text>
  <text start="490.34" dur="5.43">thought Trump said now again you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="493.4" dur="4.56">hearing one side of the story now a lot</text>
  <text start="495.77" dur="2.73">of people saying well you know that</text>
  <text start="497.96" dur="3.51">meant</text>
  <text start="498.5" dur="5.64">he needed the sob that told him to do it</text>
  <text start="501.47" dur="4.86">but no Comey didn&amp;#39;t say that call me</text>
  <text start="504.14" dur="5.13">believe that&amp;#39;s what he thought he meant</text>
  <text start="506.33" dur="7.97">or what he said that&amp;#39;s not what he said</text>
  <text start="509.27" dur="7.709">and if you read 18 US Code section 1505</text>
  <text start="514.3" dur="6.25">basically this is the part of</text>
  <text start="516.979" dur="7.531">obstruction of justice you can see that</text>
  <text start="520.55" dur="7.38">guess what it didn&amp;#39;t happen this is what</text>
  <text start="524.51" dur="5.34">this section says whoever with intent to</text>

  <text start="618.35" dur="6.48">didn&amp;#39;t do any of this this is not</text>
  <text start="621.8" dur="7.31">obstruction of justice and again we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="624.83" dur="7.02">only hearing one side of the story</text>
  <text start="629.11" dur="5.95">basically Comey is out there saying yes</text>
  <text start="631.85" dur="4.89">this is what he said now Trump all he</text>
  <text start="635.06" dur="4.8">has to do is say I didn&amp;#39;t say this</text>
  <text start="636.74" dur="5.88">here&amp;#39;s my statement of what happened so</text>
  <text start="639.86" dur="6.69">then you end up with he said and what</text>
  <text start="642.62" dur="8.1">Trump said which which is right you end</text>
  <text start="646.55" dur="8.28">up nowhere but Comey already admitted in</text>
  <text start="650.72" dur="6.33">his words there was no order to do</text>
  <text start="654.83" dur="7.05">anything it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what he feels</text>
  <text start="657.05" dur="8.52">or what he believes in the words he did</text>
  <text start="661.88" dur="5.37">not order him to do anything now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="665.57" dur="4.8">very interesting about all of this with</text>
  <text start="667.25" dur="6.72">Comey is that he typed up this entire</text>
  <text start="670.37" dur="5.7">statement and he gave it to the Senate</text>
  <text start="673.97" dur="4.11">and it was made public a day ahead of</text>
  <text start="676.07" dur="3.27">time so people could read it and you</text>
  <text start="678.08" dur="2.46">could tell that a lot of this stuff was</text>
  <text start="679.34" dur="4.74">already scripted the question for</text>
  <text start="680.54" dur="8.55">already out there and the problem I have</text>
  <text start="684.08" dur="7.05">with this is where is the memo now think</text>
  <text start="689.09" dur="4.44">about this for a second the Senate</text>
  <text start="691.13" dur="3.66">didn&amp;#39;t ask for the memo and when do you</text>
  <text start="693.53" dur="4.29">think this would be the first thing they</text>
  <text start="694.79" dur="5.4">would want ahead of time so they can see</text>
  <text start="697.82" dur="6.72">what was in the memo wouldn&amp;#39;t you think</text>
  <text start="700.19" dur="7.32">that Comey would attach the memo to his</text>
  <text start="704.54" dur="5.85">statement or actually use the memo as</text>
  <text start="707.51" dur="6.3">his statement why did he type up</text>
  <text start="710.39" dur="5.4">something completely different now they</text>
  <text start="713.81" dur="4.02">asked about the memo during the hearing</text>
  <text start="715.79" dur="4.41">and he looks a little flustered saying</text>
  <text start="717.83" dur="3.93">where is it he says well Mueller has it</text>
  <text start="720.2" dur="4.48">of course the one the especially</text>
  <text start="721.76" dur="6.4">investigator who&amp;#39;s looking into the</text>
  <text start="724.68" dur="5.58">russian collusion and everything but his</text>
  <text start="728.16" dur="4.62">friend also has a copy now how did he</text>
  <text start="730.26" dur="4.05">get it to his friend I&amp;#39;m assuming and I</text>
  <text start="732.78" dur="3.63">will assume on this that it was</text>
  <text start="734.31" dur="3.99">electronic and maybe he emailed it</text>
  <text start="736.41" dur="4.8">because I can&amp;#39;t believe he sat there and</text>
  <text start="738.3" dur="5.79">he wrote out the entire thing made a</text>
  <text start="741.21" dur="4.77">copy and met his friend and handed him a</text>
  <text start="744.09" dur="5.69">copy because even if he did do that</text>
  <text start="745.98" dur="6.63">would he keep a copy for himself and in</text>
  <text start="749.78" dur="6.24">today especially in government you know</text>
  <text start="752.61" dur="6.06">that most likely his memos are all</text>
  <text start="756.02" dur="5.17">computerized to keep them in order to</text>
  <text start="758.67" dur="5.04">easily search for them and he probably</text>
  <text start="761.19" dur="4.8">saves them in a folder if this is what</text>
  <text start="763.71" dur="5.58">he does but the whole thing doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="765.99" dur="4.86">sense because where was the memo I mean</text>
  <text start="769.29" dur="3.51">it was read to the New York Times it was</text>
  <text start="770.85" dur="4.8">given to a friend they were having this</text>
  <text start="772.8" dur="7.47">hearing he created a statement but no</text>
  <text start="775.65" dur="8.76">memo so let&amp;#39;s see if the Senate Congress</text>
  <text start="780.27" dur="7.29">actually ever get that memo because I</text>
  <text start="784.41" dur="5.28">have a funny feeling it just doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="787.56" dur="4.23">exist I think it&amp;#39;s his statement that he</text>
  <text start="789.69" dur="4.2">put together and I think this is what</text>
  <text start="791.79" dur="4.71">he&amp;#39;s been using and I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="793.89" dur="5.25">believe maybe there&amp;#39;s even a memo in the</text>
  <text start="796.5" dur="4.62">FBI because it just seems that nobody</text>
  <text start="799.14" dur="3.78">was asking for it and this is what was</text>
  <text start="801.12" dur="3.51">driving the whole entire thing now</text>
  <text start="802.92" dur="5.28">something else that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="804.63" dur="6.93">James Comey timeline on not informing</text>
  <text start="808.2" dur="9.27">Jeff Sessions something just doesn&amp;#39;t add</text>
  <text start="811.56" dur="7.95">up and this is when James Comey in his</text>
  <text start="817.47" dur="3.87">testimony statement surrounding a part</text>
  <text start="819.51" dur="4.41">of his explanation for not informing</text>

  <text start="829.2" dur="5.69">Trump about Mike flame now let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="832.14" dur="6.18">consider the timeline here February 8th</text>
  <text start="834.89" dur="4.09">Jeff Sessions was confirmed February</text>
  <text start="838.32" dur="4.02">14th</text>

  <text start="845.61" dur="6.99">ambassador kis lyac this controversy</text>
  <text start="848.52" dur="7.259">begins March 2nd sessions recuse himself</text>
  <text start="852.6" dur="5.88">from the Russian investigation now the</text>
  <text start="855.779" dur="4.62">a problem here at the time outlined by</text>
  <text start="858.48" dur="4.279">the FBI director James Comey February</text>
  <text start="860.399" dur="5.61">14th there was nothing to indicate</text>
  <text start="862.759" dur="6.31">attorney general sessions would recuse</text>
  <text start="866.009" dur="5.041">himself why On February 14th would the</text>
  <text start="869.069" dur="5.161">FBI leadership team in James Comey be</text>
  <text start="871.05" dur="6.269">saying we conclude it made little sense</text>
  <text start="874.23" dur="4.919">to report it to AJ Sessions who we are</text>
  <text start="877.319" dur="4.651">expected would likely recuse himself</text>
  <text start="879.149" dur="5.641">from involvement in the Russian related</text>
  <text start="881.97" dur="4.71">investigation so when did he recuse</text>
  <text start="884.79" dur="4.019">himself March 2nd that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="886.68" dur="4.92">interesting so why would they say</text>
  <text start="888.809" dur="6.661">February 14th because that was two weeks</text>
  <text start="891.6" dur="7.169">later so something is wrong here how did</text>
  <text start="895.47" dur="7.2">he know that Jeff Sessions was going to</text>
  <text start="898.769" dur="5.911">do this well either the FBI has psychic</text>
  <text start="902.67" dur="5.849">power and they can see into the future</text>
  <text start="904.68" dur="7.74">and they knew this or maybe they were</text>
  <text start="908.519" dur="8.341">spying on him and part of a conversation</text>
  <text start="912.42" dur="8.099">with kis lyac or someone else they heard</text>
  <text start="916.86" dur="6.959">him say this and they knew it was from</text>
  <text start="920.519" dur="7.68">sessions because he was unmasked so this</text>
  <text start="923.819" dur="8.33">timeline doesn&amp;#39;t make sense now during</text>
  <text start="928.199" dur="6.51">the whole investigation of this hearing</text>
  <text start="932.149" dur="6.341">Comey said something very interesting</text>
  <text start="934.709" dur="7.021">because this was actually unbelievable</text>
  <text start="938.49" dur="4.68">he said and he detailed with his</text>
  <text start="941.73" dur="4.049">interaction with attorney general</text>
  <text start="943.17" dur="5.01">Loretta Lynch about his specific</text>
  <text start="945.779" dur="4.591">language about the Clinton email</text>
  <text start="948.18" dur="6.379">investigation for the first time the FBI</text>
  <text start="950.37" dur="6.75">director said before the Senate that</text>
  <text start="954.559" dur="5.77">President Obama&amp;#39;s Attorney General</text>
  <text start="957.12" dur="6.6">Loretta Lynch asked him to downplay the</text>
  <text start="960.329" dur="6.45">Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s email scandal Comey</text>
  <text start="963.72" dur="5.339">said Lynch instructed him not to call</text>
  <text start="966.779" dur="4.62">the criminal investigation into the</text>
  <text start="969.059" dur="4.71">Clinton server a criminal investigation</text>
  <text start="971.399" dur="6.06">instead Lynch told call me to call it a</text>
  <text start="973.769" dur="6.211">matter which kind of confused him Comey</text>
  <text start="977.459" dur="5.22">cited that pressure from Lynch to</text>
  <text start="979.98" dur="5.07">downplay the investigation as one of the</text>
  <text start="982.679" dur="4.35">reasons he held a press conference to</text>
  <text start="985.05" dur="4.5">recommend the Department of Justice not</text>
  <text start="987.029" dur="6.421">to seek to indict Clinton</text>
  <text start="989.55" dur="6.33">now basically the FBI is only supposed</text>
  <text start="993.45" dur="5.22">to investigate the Justice Department</text>
  <text start="995.88" dur="5.04">takes all that information and they make</text>
  <text start="998.67" dur="6.57">the decision on what to do with it</text>
  <text start="1000.92" dur="5.52">so this wasn&amp;#39;t FBI&amp;#39;s commies place to</text>
  <text start="1005.24" dur="5.94">make this decision</text>
  <text start="1006.44" dur="8.07">his decision was to investigate to the</text>
  <text start="1011.18" dur="5.76">best of his ability and hand that off to</text>
  <text start="1014.51" dur="5.7">the Justice Department so who was</text>
  <text start="1016.94" dur="6.24">obstructing justice at this point it</text>
  <text start="1020.21" dur="5.61">looks like it was Loretta Lynch and it</text>
  <text start="1023.18" dur="4.62">looks like James Comey admitted to</text>
  <text start="1025.82" dur="4.38">colluding with Loretta Lynch to falsify</text>
  <text start="1027.8" dur="7.14">his statements to benefit Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1030.2" dur="7.95">campaign very interesting now CNN is out</text>
  <text start="1034.94" dur="6.18">there and they are pushing the story</text>
  <text start="1038.15" dur="5.25">about Russian hackers who allegedly</text>
  <text start="1041.12" dur="6.089">stirred up the diplomatic crisis</text>
  <text start="1043.4" dur="6.9">gripping the Gulf States and Lavrov was</text>
  <text start="1047.209" dur="5.371">out there saying listen CNN this is</text>
  <text start="1050.3" dur="6.18">becoming absolutely ridiculous</text>
  <text start="1052.58" dur="7.08">he says CNN and other media outlets they</text>
  <text start="1056.48" dur="6.41">don&amp;#39;t deserve to be called media outlets</text>
  <text start="1059.66" dur="7.17">because all they do is push</text>
  <text start="1062.89" dur="6.48">misinformation they tell lies none of</text>
  <text start="1066.83" dur="5.28">its true and they make up things</text>
  <text start="1069.37" dur="6.01">basically what he&amp;#39;s saying this is fake</text>
  <text start="1072.11" dur="5.49">news and we could see right now the</text>
  <text start="1075.38" dur="4.26">corporate media is scrambling they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1077.6" dur="5.43">know how to make heads or tails of what</text>
  <text start="1079.64" dur="5.61">is happening out in Qatar and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1083.03" dur="5.1">trying to explain this away and we need</text>
  <text start="1085.25" dur="5.64">to understand that there are many things</text>
  <text start="1088.13" dur="6.15">happening at this point in time and yes</text>
  <text start="1090.89" dur="6.42">I do believe that Trump Russia Iran</text>
  <text start="1094.28" dur="7.29">they&amp;#39;re all involved in this in doing</text>
  <text start="1097.31" dur="6.6">something very very backhanded to the</text>
  <text start="1101.57" dur="4.14">deep state think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="1103.91" dur="2.07">and we need to go back in time a little</text>
  <text start="1105.71" dur="3.56">bit</text>
  <text start="1105.98" dur="6.38">remember Qatar Saudi Arabia Jordan</text>
  <text start="1109.27" dur="6.73">Israel and the rest they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1112.36" dur="6.58">supporting they have camps within their</text>
  <text start="1116" dur="4.82">countries these are the terrorist camps</text>
  <text start="1118.94" dur="3.94">where they train all these individuals</text>
  <text start="1120.82" dur="4.31">actually if you look back</text>
  <text start="1122.88" dur="5.61">there are articles out there that say</text>
  <text start="1125.13" dur="5.04">yes Qatar has these moderate rebel camps</text>
  <text start="1128.49" dur="3.63">where they&amp;#39;re training these moderate</text>
  <text start="1130.17" dur="5.13">rebels which are at the terrorists to go</text>
  <text start="1132.12" dur="5.31">in into Syria now all these countries</text>
  <text start="1135.3" dur="4.65">they were involved in this and the base</text>
  <text start="1137.43" dur="5.13">of operation a lot of it was in Qatar</text>
  <text start="1139.95" dur="4.98">some of it was in Jordan and Saudi</text>
  <text start="1142.56" dur="4.95">Arabia Israel and the rest their funding</text>
  <text start="1144.93" dur="5.64">all of this and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1147.51" dur="5.61">about all of this is that the reason</text>
  <text start="1150.57" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re going after Qatar it&amp;#39;s first of</text>
  <text start="1153.12" dur="4.29">all Trump was out there telling the</text>
  <text start="1154.86" dur="4.65">Middle East this is over and they you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1157.41" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re using guitar because this is</text>
  <text start="1159.51" dur="5.43">where the deep state is embedded they</text>
  <text start="1163.05" dur="4.5">have camps they&amp;#39;ve been training</text>
  <text start="1164.94" dur="5.07">individuals and this is basically</text>
  <text start="1167.55" dur="5.91">sending a message to the deep state the</text>
  <text start="1170.01" dur="5.19">deep state still is training these</text>
  <text start="1173.46" dur="4.11">terrorist groups these paid mercenary</text>
  <text start="1175.2" dur="4.29">&amp;#39;you think they all come from I mean if</text>
  <text start="1177.57" dur="3.72">you notice most of them they come out of</text>
  <text start="1179.49" dur="3.93">Jordan and they move into Syria because</text>
  <text start="1181.29" dur="3.75">Jordan has the border with Syria so that</text>
  <text start="1183.42" dur="4.83">makes it very easy but a lot of the</text>
  <text start="1185.04" dur="6.42">camps are in Qatar and right now this</text>
  <text start="1188.25" dur="5.4">whole process is to squeeze the deep</text>
  <text start="1191.46" dur="4.83">state this is what this is all about</text>
  <text start="1193.65" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s not about attacking guitar it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1196.29" dur="6.44">about going in and getting the deep</text>
  <text start="1198.45" dur="8.22">state that is in Qatar remember in Qatar</text>
  <text start="1202.73" dur="7.48">the United States has troops there are</text>
  <text start="1206.67" dur="7.14">troops inside Qatar about ten thousand</text>
  <text start="1210.21" dur="6.42">US troops and NATO has forces in there</text>
  <text start="1213.81" dur="6.9">now Turkey is sending troops into this</text>
  <text start="1216.63" dur="7.5">area so we can see right now that this</text>
  <text start="1220.71" dur="5.45">is the major plan right now now by doing</text>
  <text start="1224.13" dur="4.35">this and removing the deep state</text>
  <text start="1226.16" dur="4.15">basically we could see many things</text>
  <text start="1228.48" dur="4.76">happening all at once first of all</text>
  <text start="1230.31" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re using guitar as the scapegoat</text>
  <text start="1233.24" dur="3.91">they&amp;#39;re not telling the public that oh</text>
  <text start="1235.71" dur="3.87">yes this is where the deep state lives</text>
  <text start="1237.15" dur="3.81">this is what the US has been doing with</text>
  <text start="1239.58" dur="3.57">the intelligence agencies we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1240.96" dur="3.57">training terrorists all along and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1243.15" dur="3.54">been shipping them off to all different</text>
  <text start="1244.53" dur="6">countries again this would rip the</text>
  <text start="1246.69" dur="5.4">country apart and right now this is not</text>
  <text start="1250.53" dur="3.48">part of the agenda maybe we&amp;#39;ll come down</text>
  <text start="1252.09" dur="4.32">to that where he just has to come out</text>
  <text start="1254.01" dur="4.41">and say listen here are the facts</text>
  <text start="1256.41" dur="4.05">but at this point I don&amp;#39;t think everyone</text>
  <text start="1258.42" dur="3.63">is ready to hear this I think a lot of</text>
  <text start="1260.46" dur="3.45">people will be bothered by this I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1262.05" dur="4.5">think a lot of people even believe that</text>
  <text start="1263.91" dur="4.46">this has been happening where the United</text>
  <text start="1266.55" dur="4.71">States has been supplying weapons</text>
  <text start="1268.37" dur="5.1">funding the Islamic state funding</text>
  <text start="1271.26" dur="5.21">al-qaeda it would be a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="1273.47" dur="7.12">but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="1276.47" dur="7.45">the guitar&amp;#39; Minister the Foreign</text>
  <text start="1280.59" dur="4.95">Minister is going to visit Russia and</text>
  <text start="1283.92" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re going to be talking about in</text>
  <text start="1285.54" dur="3">many he&amp;#39;s meeting with Lavrov they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1287.28" dur="3.72">going to be talking about the entire</text>
  <text start="1288.54" dur="5.4">situation and we could see right now</text>
  <text start="1291" dur="5.91">this is not about surrounding Iran</text>
  <text start="1293.94" dur="5.88">because Iran already is back in Qatar</text>
  <text start="1296.91" dur="6.42">Russia is back in Qatar and Trump is out</text>
  <text start="1299.82" dur="6.93">there playing the middle ground very</text>
  <text start="1303.33" dur="6.12">interesting where he&amp;#39;s speaking to Qatar</text>
  <text start="1306.75" dur="5.22">he&amp;#39;s speaking to Saudi Arabia telling</text>
  <text start="1309.45" dur="5.55">everyone we need to get along and saying</text>
  <text start="1311.97" dur="5.88">listen let&amp;#39;s force the deep state out of</text>
  <text start="1315" dur="5.52">this country let&amp;#39;s get them on the run</text>
  <text start="1317.85" dur="5.67">this is what this whole plan is about</text>
  <text start="1320.52" dur="6.63">and we can see that this has been</text>
  <text start="1323.52" dur="6.27">formulated and it has been processed and</text>
  <text start="1327.15" dur="5.76">this is what they are doing at this</text>
  <text start="1329.79" dur="4.74">point and the whole thing about Iran</text>
  <text start="1332.91" dur="5.19">having the Islamic state in their</text>
  <text start="1334.53" dur="8.04">country this was the deep state sending</text>
  <text start="1338.1" dur="7.23">a message to Iran back off because the</text>
  <text start="1342.57" dur="4.86">deep state they know what is going on</text>
  <text start="1345.33" dur="4.47">here they&amp;#39;re being squeezed so what is</text>
  <text start="1347.43" dur="4.98">the deep state doing right now well</text>
  <text start="1349.8" dur="4.71">yesterday we talked about this report</text>
  <text start="1352.41" dur="2.49">where Assad said listen if the United</text>
  <text start="1354.51" dur="2.58">States</text>
  <text start="1354.9" dur="4.62">you know crosses the red line we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1357.09" dur="4.89">going to attack now the question is why</text>
  <text start="1359.52" dur="4.26">would he attack just like why would he</text>
  <text start="1361.98" dur="4.26">use chemical weapons on his own people</text>
  <text start="1363.78" dur="5.1">first of all we know that was completely</text>
  <text start="1366.24" dur="5.28">fake phony and false and why would Assad</text>
  <text start="1368.88" dur="4.35">after all these years where he&amp;#39;s winning</text>
  <text start="1371.52" dur="3.09">against the terrorist groups al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="1373.23" dur="3.18">the Islamic state the moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="1374.61" dur="3.23">and he&amp;#39;s clearing the country out</text>
  <text start="1376.41" dur="4.44">liberating all these towns and villages</text>
  <text start="1377.84" dur="5.8">why would he all of a sudden attack the</text>
  <text start="1380.85" dur="4.5">United States and want to go to war does</text>
  <text start="1383.64" dur="4.2">that make any sense and bring Russia</text>
  <text start="1385.35" dur="3.37">into this war it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
