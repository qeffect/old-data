  <text start="101.72" dur="5.64">is the foundation to his economic reset</text>
  <text start="105.05" dur="4.95">plan and we need to understand that the</text>
  <text start="107.36" dur="5.37">central bank system it is completely</text>
  <text start="110" dur="5.28">imploding on itself remember they have</text>
  <text start="112.73" dur="4.95">these boom and bust cycles and it does</text>
  <text start="115.28" dur="5.58">not benefit the people the currency</text>
  <text start="117.68" dur="4.89">continually declines in value which</text>
  <text start="120.86" dur="4.29">means you need more of the same dollars</text>
  <text start="122.57" dur="6.57">to buy the same exact item does not</text>
  <text start="125.15" dur="7.65">benefit the people and the debt levels</text>
  <text start="129.14" dur="5.79">that does not benefit the people now if</text>
  <text start="132.8" dur="5.04">we look at what is happening in the</text>
  <text start="134.93" dur="7.71">housing industry we can see we have a</text>
  <text start="137.84" dur="9.509">huge problem and this was caused back in</text>
  <text start="142.64" dur="7.349">2008 and nothing has been fixed yes some</text>
  <text start="147.349" dur="4.801">people were able to get out from being</text>
  <text start="149.989" dur="4.83">underwater and sell their homes but</text>
  <text start="152.15" dur="5.99">there&amp;#39;s about 2.2 million homes in</text>
  <text start="154.819" dur="6.12">America that still have negative equity</text>
  <text start="158.14" dur="4.689">now we know that the home prices they</text>
  <text start="160.939" dur="4.171">have increased which actually threw a</text>
  <text start="162.829" dur="4.681">lot of people out of the market because</text>
  <text start="165.11" dur="5.67">the wages have not kept up with rising</text>
  <text start="167.51" dur="5.31">housing costs these new individuals</text>
  <text start="170.78" dur="3.9">coming into the market they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="172.82" dur="4.14">enough to purchase these types of homes</text>
  <text start="174.68" dur="4.23">if there is not enough of these types of</text>
  <text start="176.96" dur="3.96">people to purchase the homes those</text>
  <text start="178.91" dur="4.95">people trying to sell their homes they</text>
  <text start="180.92" dur="5.04">cannot those people that bought at the</text>
  <text start="183.86" dur="4.77">height of the market back in 2008 and</text>
  <text start="185.96" dur="4.59">their value of their home never reached</text>
  <text start="188.63" dur="4.98">that price once again they are</text>
  <text start="190.55" dur="5.97">underwater and this is a big problem now</text>
  <text start="193.61" dur="5.55">coming out of core logic they have done</text>
  <text start="196.52" dur="4.2">a quarterly survey of national home</text>
  <text start="199.16" dur="4.049">owner&amp;#39;s equity and found that there are</text>
  <text start="200.72" dur="5.64">about 2.2 million homes underwater in</text>
  <text start="203.209" dur="5.941">the US a sign of just how bad the last</text>
  <text start="206.36" dur="4.89">bubble was and a warning for where we</text>
  <text start="209.15" dur="4.74">might be headed now Trump knows this the</text>
  <text start="211.25" dur="5.85">Patriots know this they understand that</text>
  <text start="213.89" dur="5.67">most of America they&amp;#39;re in trouble now</text>
  <text start="217.1" dur="5.16">of course you can hide all of this you</text>
  <text start="219.56" dur="5.82">can keep the illusion alive and this is</text>
  <text start="222.26" dur="4.8">what&amp;#39;s been happening with the central</text>
  <text start="225.38" dur="5.1">bank the central bank has created</text>
  <text start="227.06" dur="7.02">stimulus credit bubbles and it is hidden</text>
  <text start="230.48" dur="6.66">all of this behind this but it won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="234.08" dur="6.14">last forever Trump and the Patriots know</text>
  <text start="237.14" dur="5.52">this they&amp;#39;re racing against time and</text>
  <text start="240.22" dur="6.16">when we look at the housing industry</text>
  <text start="242.66" dur="5.7">this is a very big part of the economy</text>
  <text start="246.38" dur="5.19">because a lot of people&amp;#39;s wealth is</text>
  <text start="248.36" dur="5.849">stored in the homes and they use this</text>
  <text start="251.57" dur="4.83">for retirement and when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="254.209" dur="5.491">underwater you cannot use this you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="256.4" dur="6.11">feel confident now the housing crisis</text>
  <text start="259.7" dur="5.19">that we saw back in 2008 it&amp;#39;s most</text>
  <text start="262.51" dur="5.26">noticeable in the hardest-hit markets</text>
  <text start="264.89" dur="5.37">Las Vegas Chicago Miami still have among</text>
  <text start="267.77" dur="6.63">the highest rates of underwater</text>
  <text start="270.26" dur="5.67">mortgages in the country and when this</text>
  <text start="274.4" dur="4.32">whole thing comes down there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="275.93" dur="6.21">be a lot more people underwater this is</text>
  <text start="278.72" dur="7.05">why Trump is pushing the economic reset</text>
  <text start="282.14" dur="7.23">plan so hard right now now we know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.77" dur="5.79">using tariffs as leverage and we know</text>
  <text start="289.37" dur="4.29">that the mainstream media we know the</text>
  <text start="291.56" dur="5.1">financial pundits they were all out</text>
  <text start="293.66" dur="4.95">there claiming that because of these</text>
  <text start="296.66" dur="2.46">tariffs we&amp;#39;re going to see higher prices</text>
  <text start="298.61" dur="3">on</text>
  <text start="299.12" dur="4.98">imported goods and it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="301.61" dur="6.48">complete and utter disaster for the</text>
  <text start="304.1" dur="6.09">everyday consumer well in actuality the</text>
  <text start="308.09" dur="6.03">year-over-year prices of import products</text>
  <text start="310.19" dur="7.05">are actually dropping not rising now</text>
  <text start="314.12" dur="6.03">that&amp;#39;s kind of odd isn&amp;#39;t it u.s. import</text>
  <text start="317.24" dur="6.149">prices fell by 0.3% in May the first</text>
  <text start="320.15" dur="7.23">monthly decline since a 1.4 percent drop</text>
  <text start="323.389" dur="5.641">in December import prices advanced 1.8%</text>

  <text start="331.639" dur="6.121">overall imports decreased by 1.5 percent</text>
  <text start="334.19" dur="7.16">over the past 12 months the u.s. steel</text>
  <text start="337.76" dur="7.74">and aluminum tariffs have been in effect</text>
  <text start="341.35" dur="6.64">globally since 2017 tariffs on softwood</text>
  <text start="345.5" dur="5.419">lumber which is in Canada and durable</text>
  <text start="347.99" dur="4.92">appliances South Korea same duration</text>
  <text start="350.919" dur="4.601">additionally the first set of tariffs on</text>
  <text start="352.91" dur="4.95">China is now well over a year old and</text>
  <text start="355.52" dur="5.34">the second set of expanded tariffs on</text>
  <text start="357.86" dur="6.17">try to begin a month ago again no</text>
  <text start="360.86" dur="7.71">material impact to the delivered price</text>
  <text start="364.03" dur="8.56">guess what they were wrong the economic</text>
  <text start="368.57" dur="8.3">reset plan is working we explained how</text>
  <text start="372.59" dur="7.829">these tariffs work and we are not seeing</text>
  <text start="376.87" dur="5.08">price increases because remember there</text>
  <text start="380.419" dur="4.981">are many many different middlemen and</text>
  <text start="381.95" dur="6.18">the tariffs go to the first middleman so</text>
  <text start="385.4" dur="6.12">if the product cost 22 cents you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="388.13" dur="5.58">talking about 10% 20% 30% on 22 cents at</text>
  <text start="391.52" dur="6.48">the product cost 10 bucks you&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="393.71" dur="7.44">about the percentage on the $10 not on</text>
  <text start="398" dur="5.55">the final price and what are we seeing</text>
  <text start="401.15" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;re seeing the middlemen absorb all</text>
  <text start="403.55" dur="6.36">this the countries are paying for the</text>
  <text start="406.28" dur="6.42">tariffs Trump was right the mainstream</text>
  <text start="409.91" dur="5.91">media the financial pundits completely</text>
  <text start="412.7" dur="6.689">wrong all that fear-mongering guess what</text>
  <text start="415.82" dur="6.33">didn&amp;#39;t come true now we&amp;#39;re moving into</text>
  <text start="419.389" dur="6.061">the next phase and this is going to be</text>
  <text start="422.15" dur="5.19">making trade deals with China and many</text>
  <text start="425.45" dur="4.589">of the countries Trump is going to</text>
  <text start="427.34" dur="4.5">continue this so what is happening with</text>
  <text start="430.039" dur="6.691">China well</text>
  <text start="431.84" dur="7.68">Trump he has leveraged himself and put</text>
  <text start="436.73" dur="6.6">Xi Jinping in a corner</text>
  <text start="439.52" dur="6.99">why because Trump has said that he would</text>
  <text start="443.33" dur="5.52">like to meet Jinping and talk about the</text>
  <text start="446.51" dur="5.55">trade deals in the upcoming g20 summit</text>
  <text start="448.85" dur="6">this will be the last chance to make a</text>
  <text start="452.06" dur="5.4">deal and we know that Trump has the</text>
  <text start="454.85" dur="5.85">strongest strategic position any Chinese</text>
  <text start="457.46" dur="6.36">official has ever faced the economy in</text>
  <text start="460.7" dur="5.61">China well it&amp;#39;s not doing well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="463.82" dur="5.25">imploding from the pressure that&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="466.31" dur="5.609">applied to it and suddenly it has only</text>
  <text start="469.07" dur="5.819">been a month since the consequence phase</text>
  <text start="471.919" dur="6.5">began in addition to tariffs increase</text>
  <text start="474.889" dur="5.641">the u.s. blacklisted Huawei Technologies</text>
  <text start="478.419" dur="3.911">threatened other major Chinese tech</text>
  <text start="480.53" dur="3.72">companies and essentially cut off China</text>
  <text start="482.33" dur="5.61">from the international supply chain it</text>
  <text start="484.25" dur="6.419">needs to sustain itself what a Beijing</text>
  <text start="487.94" dur="5.31">do well it responded by drawing up a</text>
  <text start="490.669" dur="4.47">list of unreliable entities and making</text>
  <text start="493.25" dur="3.75">threats against any enterprise that</text>
  <text start="495.139" dur="6.09">would walk away from business engagement</text>
  <text start="497" dur="7.44">with China China does not believe in</text>
  <text start="501.229" dur="5.971">concession from current position within</text>
  <text start="504.44" dur="6.57">any terms in advance of the g20 summit</text>
  <text start="507.2" dur="6.63">in Japan Trump positioned G in a</text>
  <text start="511.01" dur="7.5">lose-lose dynamic and this is all part</text>
  <text start="513.83" dur="6.899">of the plan to force China into making</text>
  <text start="518.51" dur="5.06">this deal now I think a lot of the deal</text>
  <text start="520.729" dur="4.831">the framework is already completed and</text>
  <text start="523.57" dur="3.67">we can see that there are certain</text>
  <text start="525.56" dur="3.42">individuals within the Chinese</text>
  <text start="527.24" dur="3.66">government just like in the United</text>
  <text start="528.98" dur="3.23">States government that don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="530.9" dur="4.08">to happen</text>
  <text start="532.21" dur="4.99">remember each country has a deep state</text>
  <text start="534.98" dur="4.35">faction within the country and I believe</text>
  <text start="537.2" dur="5">there are certain individuals that do</text>
  <text start="539.33" dur="6.87">not want this to happen now Bloomberg</text>
  <text start="542.2" dur="7.329">kinda explains all of this and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="546.2" dur="7.139">quite remarkable by now</text>
  <text start="549.529" dur="6.18">xi Jinping is used to Trump&amp;#39;s tariff</text>
  <text start="553.339" dur="5.401">threats but the u.s. president&amp;#39;s latest</text>
  <text start="555.709" dur="4.711">ultimatum is personal and the Chinese</text>
  <text start="558.74" dur="4.14">leaders response could have a</text>
  <text start="560.42" dur="4.35">far-reaching consequences political</text>
  <text start="562.88" dur="4.38">future Trump</text>
  <text start="564.77" dur="6">said he could impose tariffs much higher</text>
  <text start="567.26" dur="6.63">than 25% on 300 billion in Chinese goods</text>
  <text start="570.77" dur="6.3">if she doesn&amp;#39;t meet with him at the</text>
  <text start="573.89" dur="5.639">upcoming group of g20 summit in Japan</text>
  <text start="577.07" dur="4.35">now China&amp;#39;s foreign ministry which</text>

  <text start="583.58" dur="7.17">declined to say whether the meeting</text>
  <text start="586.22" dur="6.75">would take place the brinkmanship puts G</text>
  <text start="590.75" dur="4.399">China strongest leader in decades and</text>
  <text start="592.97" dur="6.059">perhaps the toughest spot of his</text>

  <text start="599.029" dur="6.031">Trump&amp;#39;s threats he risked looking weak</text>
  <text start="601.49" dur="5.909">at home if he declines the meeting he</text>
  <text start="605.06" dur="4.92">must accept the economic costs that come</text>

  <text start="639.05" dur="6.2">faces a lose-lose situation</text>
  <text start="641.41" dur="7.9">Trump strategically outmaneuvered them</text>
  <text start="645.25" dur="6.1">because he understands that the trade</text>

  <text start="658.7" dur="5.54">of the United States actually not even</text>
  <text start="660.26" dur="7.38">good for China itself moving forward</text>
  <text start="664.24" dur="5.8">Trump understands that the world is</text>
  <text start="667.64" dur="3.87">about to change I think G understands</text>
  <text start="670.04" dur="3.27">the world is about the chain Putin</text>

  <text start="691.279" dur="4.99">this reversing it very very quickly</text>
  <text start="694.459" dur="5.47">he has to</text>
