  <text start="63.43" dur="5.26">2017 and the plot of the episode is a</text>
  <text start="65.9" dur="5.36">new currency emerges as the old currency</text>
  <text start="68.69" dur="4.89">withers away welcome to the transition</text>
  <text start="71.26" dur="4.96">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="73.58" dur="6">financial news now what&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="76.22" dur="5.61">amazing is each day that we look at the</text>
  <text start="79.58" dur="4.44">economic data of course the corporate</text>
  <text start="81.83" dur="4.44">media you know the financial pundants</text>
  <text start="84.02" dur="4.23">the Fed they like to tell you how great</text>
  <text start="86.27" dur="3.72">the statistics are please look at the</text>
  <text start="88.25" dur="3.84">stock market look how great it is but</text>
  <text start="89.99" dur="4.77">when we drill down and we start looking</text>
  <text start="92.09" dur="5.49">at the nitty-gritty and we see what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="94.76" dur="5.82">occurring we can see that the economy is</text>
  <text start="97.58" dur="5.22">losing steam and when I say the economy</text>
  <text start="100.58" dur="5.28">is losing steam I&amp;#39;m not talking about an</text>
  <text start="102.8" dur="6.48">economy that&amp;#39;s been robust an economy</text>
  <text start="105.86" dur="5.55">that&amp;#39;s been on the on the mend that has</text>
  <text start="109.28" dur="4.88">been recovering I&amp;#39;m talking about an</text>
  <text start="111.41" dur="5.54">economy that has been pumped up on</text>
  <text start="114.16" dur="7.87">stimulus I&amp;#39;m talking about an economy</text>
  <text start="116.95" dur="8.44">that was created to make it look like it</text>
  <text start="122.03" dur="5.759">was recovering and now all of that that</text>
  <text start="125.39" dur="5.7">they have done in the last eight or so</text>
  <text start="127.789" dur="5.791">years is coming to an end and it is</text>
  <text start="131.09" dur="4.17">breaking apart like we&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="133.58" dur="3.66">before now the Fed is trying to hide</text>
  <text start="135.26" dur="3.54">certain aspects of it where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="137.24" dur="3.81">getting rid of one of their indexes</text>
  <text start="138.8" dur="4.65">which shows and I have to say it was</text>
  <text start="141.05" dur="4.62">pretty darn on track with every single</text>
  <text start="143.45" dur="3.63">recession and they don&amp;#39;t want that out</text>
  <text start="145.67" dur="4.98">there they don&amp;#39;t want people to see that</text>
  <text start="147.08" dur="5.28">so what they usually do is they hide or</text>
  <text start="150.65" dur="3.27">get rid of it saying it wasn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="152.36" dur="4.08">that important just like the m2 money</text>
  <text start="153.92" dur="4.53">supply and everything else so what they</text>
  <text start="156.44" dur="4.379">try to do is they try to make it seem</text>
  <text start="158.45" dur="4.68">like that we really don&amp;#39;t need this and</text>
  <text start="160.819" dur="4.051">it really wasn&amp;#39;t important but when we</text>
  <text start="163.13" dur="3.27">start looking at all the economic</text>
  <text start="164.87" dur="3.24">indicators and we start looking at what</text>
  <text start="166.4" dur="4.919">has really been going on we can see that</text>
  <text start="168.11" dur="6.95">things well they&amp;#39;re not exactly what</text>
  <text start="171.319" dur="6.301">they seem now the government the Fed</text>
  <text start="175.06" dur="6.22">they want us but they want us to believe</text>
  <text start="177.62" dur="6.869">that everyone is getting a job in the</text>
  <text start="181.28" dur="5.01">food and services industry this is where</text>
  <text start="184.489" dur="2.341">everyone is getting work this is why the</text>
  <text start="186.29" dur="3.36">unemployed</text>
  <text start="186.83" dur="5.04">rate is getting lower and lower and</text>
  <text start="189.65" dur="3.6">lower and it looks like we&amp;#39;re almost at</text>
  <text start="191.87" dur="2.7">full employment but when we start to</text>
  <text start="193.25" dur="3.6">look at what&amp;#39;s really happening we can</text>
  <text start="194.57" dur="4.47">see that this is kind of impossible now</text>
  <text start="196.85" dur="4.41">we did the same thing going back a</text>
  <text start="199.04" dur="3.18">couple of years ago with retail when</text>
  <text start="201.26" dur="3.15">they told us that you know the</text>
  <text start="202.22" dur="6.21">unemployment rate fell from ten to eight</text>
  <text start="204.41" dur="6.48">to seven and so on and the sales in</text>
  <text start="208.43" dur="3.72">retail continually dropped and we said</text>
  <text start="210.89" dur="3.03">and we scratched our heads and we said</text>
  <text start="212.15" dur="5.88">something&amp;#39;s wrong here something doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="213.92" dur="5.82">make sense and then we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="218.03" dur="4.17">what has been happening we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="219.74" dur="4.86">seeing that the entire retail market is</text>
  <text start="222.2" dur="3.81">collapsing on itself and it has nothing</text>
  <text start="224.6" dur="3.99">to do with the weather has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="226.01" dur="4.35">with online sales it has to do with the</text>
  <text start="228.59" dur="3.57">real economy where people they just</text>
  <text start="230.36" dur="4.29">don&amp;#39;t have that money to spend anymore</text>
  <text start="232.16" dur="5.25">now when we look at the restaurant</text>
  <text start="234.65" dur="5.34">industry what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="237.41" dur="4.83">that the restaurant industry is the</text>
  <text start="239.99" dur="6.66">worst since 2009</text>
  <text start="242.24" dur="6.69">now households at a lower 80% of income</text>
  <text start="246.65" dur="5.339">scale they&amp;#39;re completely maxed out right</text>
  <text start="248.93" dur="6">now and July proved to be a tough month</text>
  <text start="251.989" dur="5.43">for chain restaurants now this is coming</text>
  <text start="254.93" dur="4.89">from the latest report and the foot</text>
  <text start="257.419" dur="4.32">track traffic at chain restaurants fell</text>
  <text start="259.82" dur="5.55">by four point seven percent in July year</text>
  <text start="261.739" dur="5.881">over year same store sales fell by 2.8</text>
  <text start="265.37" dur="4.799">percent the seventeenth month in a row</text>
  <text start="267.62" dur="6.36">of year-over-year declines the longest</text>
  <text start="270.169" dur="6.031">downturn since 2009 and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="273.98" dur="5.1">looking at right now is that this is a</text>
  <text start="276.2" dur="5.94">complete disaster now this was taken</text>
  <text start="279.08" dur="7.35">from an restaurant industry snapshot by</text>
  <text start="282.14" dur="6.24">TD n2k and they looked at 27,000</text>
  <text start="286.43" dur="4.77">restaurant units and 155 brands</text>
  <text start="288.38" dur="5.52">generating about 67 billion in annual</text>
  <text start="291.2" dur="5.16">revenue and they&amp;#39;re saying that food</text>
  <text start="293.9" dur="6.72">sales are down alcohol sales were way</text>
  <text start="296.36" dur="7.95">down but prices are up so the prices in</text>
  <text start="300.62" dur="6.24">restaurants they&amp;#39;re moving up and even</text>
  <text start="304.31" dur="5.55">though the prices are going up it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="306.86" dur="5.97">still not making a difference they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="309.86" dur="5.73">still losing money because the customer</text>
  <text start="312.83" dur="4.77">base isn&amp;#39;t there anymore it is declining</text>
  <text start="315.59" dur="4.71">and we saw this during the Great</text>
  <text start="317.6" dur="5.539">Recession we saw exactly the</text>
  <text start="320.3" dur="6.329">same exact thing and here we are</text>
  <text start="323.139" dur="7.18">experiencing the same thing which tells</text>
  <text start="326.629" dur="6.57">us that this is another indicator and we</text>
  <text start="330.319" dur="6.391">are in big trouble now remember credit</text>
  <text start="333.199" dur="6.15">card debt is way up people are using</text>
  <text start="336.71" dur="5.19">this to get by they&amp;#39;re not going out to</text>
  <text start="339.349" dur="4.231">eat they&amp;#39;re most likely using it in the</text>
  <text start="341.9" dur="3.66">supermarkets just to buy the food and</text>
  <text start="343.58" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re making things on their own we</text>
  <text start="345.56" dur="4.47">see student loans are up we see</text>
  <text start="347.33" dur="5.04">automobile loans are up and what is</text>
  <text start="350.03" dur="4.319">happening right now is that people are</text>
  <text start="352.37" dur="4.62">continually losing their jobs and the</text>
  <text start="354.349" dur="6.511">jobs that are being produced well</text>
  <text start="356.99" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re part-time low-paying jobs and it</text>
  <text start="360.86" dur="6.089">is just not working out for the everyday</text>
  <text start="362.81" dur="7.259">person now Trump at this point he signed</text>
  <text start="366.949" dur="5.581">a memo addressing China&amp;#39;s laws policies</text>
  <text start="370.069" dur="4.5">practices and actions and this is all</text>
  <text start="372.53" dur="5.37">related to the intellectual property</text>
  <text start="374.569" dur="5.16">innovation and technology and basically</text>
  <text start="377.9" dur="4.259">what he&amp;#39;s looking into right now he</text>
  <text start="379.729" dur="5.49">didn&amp;#39;t impose sanctions or anything like</text>
  <text start="382.159" dur="6.721">that he wants to know what China has</text>
  <text start="385.219" dur="7.32">been doing with us in regards to trade</text>
  <text start="388.88" dur="6.06">now US Trade Representative Robert light</text>
  <text start="392.539" dur="5.19">Peyser well he&amp;#39;s going to examine</text>
  <text start="394.94" dur="4.8">China&amp;#39;s policies their practices and</text>
  <text start="397.729" dur="4.47">their actions when it comes to the</text>
  <text start="399.74" dur="5.359">transfer of US technology theft of</text>
  <text start="402.199" dur="6.301">American intellectual property and</text>
  <text start="405.099" dur="5.651">basically looking how this all is</text>
  <text start="408.5" dur="4.56">occurring right now because we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="410.75" dur="3.81">some problems we&amp;#39;ve had problems where</text>
  <text start="413.06" dur="5.219">there are other administration&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="414.56" dur="7.319">Clintons where they kind of sold off</text>
  <text start="418.279" dur="5.61">some of the information to China and we</text>
  <text start="421.879" dur="5.13">can see right now that these trade deals</text>
  <text start="423.889" dur="5.671">that were worked out with the global</text>
  <text start="427.009" dur="4.951">elite with the deep state with the</text>
  <text start="429.56" dur="4.68">central bank well this is not in the</text>
  <text start="431.96" dur="4.889">best interest for the United States now</text>
  <text start="434.24" dur="5.85">remember what they were trying to do all</text>
  <text start="436.849" dur="7.171">of this time they were trying to create</text>
  <text start="440.09" dur="5.939">a one-world type of global government</text>
  <text start="444.02" dur="4.319">where all the countries were pretty much</text>
  <text start="446.029" dur="4.711">the same they needed to bring all the</text>
  <text start="448.339" dur="5.281">countries on an even playing field and</text>
  <text start="450.74" dur="3.429">they needed these salaries to be pretty</text>
  <text start="453.62" dur="2.62">much</text>
  <text start="454.169" dur="3.84">because this way it didn&amp;#39;t matter where</text>
  <text start="456.24" dur="3.989">you were and this is what they were</text>
  <text start="458.009" dur="4.77">trying to do so right now</text>
  <text start="460.229" dur="4.731">Trump is looking into this and the deep</text>
  <text start="462.779" dur="5.76">state is a little worried about this now</text>
  <text start="464.96" dur="6.25">he needs to do this because we need to</text>
  <text start="468.539" dur="5.4">bring manufacturing back to the United</text>
  <text start="471.21" dur="5.639">States and this is all part of the</text>
  <text start="473.939" dur="6.56">process of doing this and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="476.849" dur="6.54">hurt remember going through a transition</text>
  <text start="480.499" dur="5.2">bringing everything back here to the</text>
  <text start="483.389" dur="5.701">United States going through an economic</text>
  <text start="485.699" dur="5.22">reset it is not pleasant and those in</text>
  <text start="489.09" dur="4.379">power the deep state the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="490.919" dur="4.56">the globalists who wanted it completely</text>
  <text start="493.469" dur="4.98">different well they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="495.479" dur="5.43">react very friendless friendly to this</text>
  <text start="498.449" dur="4.53">they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen now there</text>
  <text start="500.909" dur="4.38">are certain corporations that are going</text>
  <text start="502.979" dur="4.921">to be affected by this Apple remember</text>
  <text start="505.289" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re getting a lot of their phones</text>
  <text start="507.9" dur="4.71">and other technology they&amp;#39;re being built</text>
  <text start="509.819" dur="5.4">in China we have many other corporations</text>
  <text start="512.61" dur="5.4">that moved everything out of the United</text>
  <text start="515.219" dur="6.391">States over there and we can see that a</text>
  <text start="518.01" dur="6.18">lot of merchandise is imported from</text>
  <text start="521.61" dur="5.909">China and it&amp;#39;s going to affect Walmart</text>
  <text start="524.19" dur="5.31">so again this is not going to be an easy</text>
  <text start="527.519" dur="3.901">process as we go through this now of</text>
  <text start="529.5" dur="4.29">course China does not like this.what</text>
  <text start="531.42" dur="3.84">whatsoever you know they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="533.79" dur="3.93">saying they&amp;#39;re going to retaliate and</text>
  <text start="535.26" dur="4.53">remember once again China does hold all</text>
  <text start="537.72" dur="4.2">the cards they have the manufacturing</text>
  <text start="539.79" dur="5.159">the United States does and they can hurt</text>
  <text start="541.92" dur="6.84">our economy quite a bit we are a service</text>
  <text start="544.949" dur="8.101">economy we consume we really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="548.76" dur="6.9">produce that much anymore and as we go</text>
  <text start="553.05" dur="5.729">through this year and throughout next</text>
  <text start="555.66" dur="6.72">year the economy is deteriorating Amex</text>
  <text start="558.779" dur="4.74">added an accelerated pace and what is</text>
  <text start="562.38" dur="2.16">happening right now from all the</text>
  <text start="563.519" dur="3.57">indicators that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="564.54" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse and the</text>
  <text start="567.089" dur="4.411">clock is ticking down and we can see</text>
  <text start="569.76" dur="2.939">that parts of the transition well</text>
  <text start="571.5" dur="3.209">they&amp;#39;ve already started we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="572.699" dur="4.26">discuss that in a little bit but when we</text>
  <text start="574.709" dur="4.231">look at the economy right now we can see</text>
  <text start="576.959" dur="4.591">that the economy well we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="578.94" dur="4.649">recession now I know the central bank I</text>
  <text start="581.55" dur="3.12">know the government they&amp;#39;re not out</text>
  <text start="583.589" dur="2.521">there saying that we&amp;#39;re in a recession</text>
  <text start="584.67" dur="2.26">the corporate media is not out there</text>
  <text start="586.11" dur="3.85">saying we&amp;#39;re nervous</text>
  <text start="586.93" dur="7.64">but when we start to look at the</text>
  <text start="589.96" dur="7.77">specifics of the economy they equal a</text>
  <text start="594.57" dur="6.01">recession they match up to everything</text>
  <text start="597.73" dur="5.549">that is the definition of a recession</text>
  <text start="600.58" dur="6.569">and actually some parts are even a lot</text>
  <text start="603.279" dur="5.881">worse than the Great Recession now when</text>
  <text start="607.149" dur="5.25">we look at this we can see the gross</text>
  <text start="609.16" dur="6.63">domestic product of GDP it is declined</text>
  <text start="612.399" dur="6.451">for two or more quarters and this is a</text>
  <text start="615.79" dur="6.989">sign of a recession and remember going</text>
  <text start="618.85" dur="7.35">back to 2008-2009 this is the weakest</text>
  <text start="622.779" dur="6.331">recovery that we&amp;#39;ve ever seen and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="626.2" dur="6.03">not a recovery it&amp;#39;s a an illusion that</text>
  <text start="629.11" dur="5.19">has been built up on stimulus now when</text>
  <text start="632.23" dur="4.77">we look at some of the data like auto</text>
  <text start="634.3" dur="5.479">light truck sales well they&amp;#39;re either</text>
  <text start="637" dur="5.459">down or off a cliff when we look at</text>
  <text start="639.779" dur="4.991">restaurant dining well we discuss that</text>
  <text start="642.459" dur="5.281">sales are down when we look at federal</text>
  <text start="644.77" dur="4.98">tax receipts state tax receipts they are</text>
  <text start="647.74" dur="4.5">down when we look at retail sales</text>
  <text start="649.75" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re flat stagnant or down depending</text>
  <text start="652.24" dur="5.16">on the sector when we look at rents in</text>
  <text start="655.06" dur="5.969">high rent regions they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="657.4" dur="6.18">soften consumer debt hitting new highs</text>
  <text start="661.029" dur="5.93">we&amp;#39;ve seen this right before the crash</text>

  <text start="1041.31" dur="4.26">lot of people have no clue that is</text>
  <text start="1043.2" dur="3.81">happening just like the internet when</text>
  <text start="1045.57" dur="3.54">that was born no one really knew what</text>
  <text start="1047.01" dur="4.44">was going on people didn&amp;#39;t understand</text>

  <text start="1074.37" dur="4.23">was going to be huge and they wanted to</text>
  <text start="1076.8" dur="3.24">start purchasing these names and holding</text>
  <text start="1078.6" dur="3.09">onto them because they knew later on</text>

  <text start="1086.28" dur="4.38">right now we&amp;#39;re going through this major</text>
  <text start="1088.71" dur="3.59">transition now a lot of people I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="1090.66" dur="3.69">to say very small percentage of people</text>
  <text start="1092.3" dur="3.97">understand what we&amp;#39;re going through</text>
  <text start="1094.35" dur="3.42">right now and we see a lot of countries</text>

  <text start="1123.85" dur="4.98">into cryptocurrency and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1126.55" dur="5.21">see a lot of this here in the United</text>

  <text start="1134.11" dur="5.22">and the central bankers they realize</text>
  <text start="1136.54" dur="6.33">what is happening this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1139.33" dur="5.46">creating all these bills like we could</text>

  <text start="1149.05" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re going to go after those</text>
  <text start="1151.12" dur="3.39">individuals that are using</text>
  <text start="1152.74" dur="3.63">cryptocurrency now of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1154.51" dur="4.73">saying this is we&amp;#39;re going after these</text>
  <text start="1156.37" dur="5.97">individuals to combat terrorism and</text>
  <text start="1159.24" dur="5.64">we&amp;#39;re you know looking into this we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1164.88" dur="6.4">cybercrime or any other threat that</text>
  <text start="1168.01" dur="5.79">might have to do with cryptocurrency now</text>
  <text start="1171.28" dur="3.69">the reason why they are doing this is</text>
  <text start="1173.8" dur="4.44">because they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out a</text>
  <text start="1174.97" dur="5.28">way on how they can stop this now once</text>
  <text start="1178.24" dur="4.5">again this is going to be very difficult</text>
  <text start="1180.25" dur="3.57">now I know like they said oh well we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1182.74" dur="5.85">go after coinbase</text>
  <text start="1183.82" dur="7.32">and we&amp;#39;ll go after that platform because</text>
  <text start="1188.59" dur="5.55">they hold a lot of people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1191.14" dur="5.31">cryptocurrency well that is absolutely</text>
  <text start="1194.14" dur="5.49">ridiculous because all people have to do</text>
  <text start="1196.45" dur="6.9">is move that off of coin base and move</text>
  <text start="1199.63" dur="6.54">it into a private wallet guess what they</text>
  <text start="1203.35" dur="4.92">can&amp;#39;t touch it then yes they can go to a</text>
  <text start="1206.17" dur="3.78">certain corporation and say we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1208.27" dur="3.09">locking it down we&amp;#39;re going to put</text>
  <text start="1209.95" dur="4.26">restrictions or whatever they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1211.36" dur="4.83">to do but there are plenty other</text>
  <text start="1214.21" dur="3.39">exchanges around the world that they</text>
  <text start="1216.19" dur="3.84">have no control over now they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1217.6" dur="4.68">to control it but it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="1220.03" dur="6.24">very difficult the reason why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1222.28" dur="7.02">doing this is because we are in the</text>
  <text start="1226.27" dur="4.8">middle of a transition now it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1232.99" dur="5.58">we&amp;#39;re in the beginning stages of this</text>
  <text start="1236.56" dur="3.3">transition where people are saying you</text>

  <text start="1253.09" dur="3.929">absolutely not actually</text>
  <text start="1254.32" dur="5.699">this is going to benefit gold and silver</text>
  <text start="1257.019" dur="6.841">because as we move away from the dollar</text>

  <text start="1285.07" dur="2.339">to be</text>
  <text start="1285.58" dur="5.91">I mean before we had to go through AOL</text>

  <text start="1307.84" dur="6.689">that we are heading down this path and</text>
  <text start="1309.7" dur="9.959">we are basically in the beginning stages</text>
  <text start="1314.529" dur="8.161">of a transition period of a new currency</text>
  <text start="1319.659" dur="5.4">system this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that this is</text>
  <text start="1322.69" dur="4.079">what it&amp;#39;s going to be but people are</text>
  <text start="1325.059" dur="4.23">looking at this and people are diving</text>
  <text start="1326.769" dur="5.101">into it because they realize it gives</text>
  <text start="1329.289" dur="4.531">them freedom it separates them from the</text>
  <text start="1331.87" dur="4.169">central banking system and it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="1333.82" dur="5.04">here in the US it&amp;#39;s around the world and</text>

  <text start="1338.86" dur="2.85">the right direction</text>
  <text start="1339.49" dur="4.95">because you&amp;#39;ll see governments around</text>
  <text start="1341.71" dur="4.169">the world trying to crack down on this</text>
  <text start="1344.44" dur="3.75">you&amp;#39;ll see governments of the world</text>
  <text start="1345.879" dur="3.51">trying to gain control of this and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1348.19" dur="4.38">talking about the government&amp;#39;s central</text>
  <text start="1349.389" dur="4.74">banks intertwined you will see this</text>
  <text start="1352.57" dur="3.51">happen just like now you&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="1354.129" dur="3.481">all these different bills where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1356.08" dur="4.829">going to say no due to national security</text>
  <text start="1357.61" dur="5.13">due to terrorism due to this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1360.909" dur="3.961">going to push this as hard as they</text>
  <text start="1362.74" dur="4.47">possibly can because they need to gain</text>
  <text start="1364.87" dur="5.669">control but the thing is they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1367.21" dur="6.27">control it it is out of their reach and</text>
  <text start="1370.539" dur="5.191">they are not going to like this and this</text>
  <text start="1373.48" dur="4.98">is the beginning stages what it will</text>
  <text start="1375.73" dur="4.86">look like later on we don&amp;#39;t know think</text>
  <text start="1378.46" dur="5.189">about the internet as it was being born</text>
  <text start="1380.59" dur="5.039">everyone used Yahoo Google was in the</text>
  <text start="1383.649" dur="4.441">background and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="1385.629" dur="4.17">Google was the search engine and yeah</text>
  <text start="1388.09" dur="5.28">who well they&amp;#39;re trying to survive right</text>
  <text start="1389.799" dur="6.87">now and look how the Internet has</text>
  <text start="1393.37" dur="5.07">completely changed everything where</text>
  <text start="1396.669" dur="3.841">everything goes through the internet</text>
  <text start="1398.44" dur="4.53">everything that you want to do you can</text>
  <text start="1400.51" dur="4.71">buy gold and silver through the internet</text>
  <text start="1402.97" dur="4.98">you can go onto the internet and use</text>
  <text start="1405.22" dur="4.949">cryptocurrencies you can buy and sell</text>
  <text start="1407.95" dur="4.38">all your products there&amp;#39;s so many things</text>
  <text start="1410.169" dur="3.841">that are happening right now the same</text>
  <text start="1412.33" dur="5.27">thing is happening with this transition</text>
  <text start="1414.01" dur="8.01">and this transition needs to be there</text>
  <text start="1417.6" dur="7">because it&amp;#39;s going to help with the</text>
  <text start="1422.02" dur="5.009">entire destruction of the old&amp;#39; system</text>
  <text start="1424.6" dur="5.329">and help with the birth of the new</text>
  <text start="1427.029" dur="6.451">system and this is why we&amp;#39;re at the very</text>
  <text start="1429.929" dur="4.061">beginning stages of this and as we move</text>
  <text start="1433.48" dur="3.329">forward</text>
  <text start="1433.99" dur="4.98">it will gain momentum more people will</text>
  <text start="1436.809" dur="4.921">know about it and people will start to</text>
  <text start="1438.97" dur="5.069">realize you know something we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="1441.73" dur="4.47">the dollar we don&amp;#39;t need any of this and</text>
  <text start="1444.039" dur="3.24">hopefully it grows large enough where</text>
  <text start="1446.2" dur="3.27">they say you know something</text>
  <text start="1447.279" dur="4.711">we don&amp;#39;t need the SDR we don&amp;#39;t even need</text>

  <text start="1480.25" dur="8.37">from the dollar and the real value of</text>
  <text start="1483.49" dur="7.38">these metals will increase along with</text>
  <text start="1488.62" dur="4.32">the cryptocurrency and this is what</text>
