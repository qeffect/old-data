  <text start="108.95" dur="5.64">biz that are getting a little nervous</text>
  <text start="111.17" dur="6.57">about crypto currencies because there</text>

  <text start="135.98" dur="4.979">case that crypto assets may one day</text>
  <text start="137.75" dur="5.16">reduce demand for central bank money and</text>
  <text start="140.959" dur="6.181">that the government institutions must</text>
  <text start="142.91" dur="7.949">must do more to not to let this happen</text>
  <text start="147.14" dur="5.76">in other words to forestall the</text>
  <text start="150.859" dur="4.561">competitive pressure crypto assets may</text>
  <text start="152.9" dur="4.92">exert on fiat currencies central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="155.42" dur="7.319">need to adopt some of the core concepts</text>
  <text start="157.82" dur="6.81">driving digital assets so at this time</text>
  <text start="162.739" dur="4.831">we can see the central bank&amp;#39;s they</text>
  <text start="164.63" dur="5.52">realize if the people understand what</text>
  <text start="167.57" dur="5.639">crypto currencies are and people start</text>
  <text start="170.15" dur="5.28">moving away from the Fiat system over to</text>
  <text start="173.209" dur="5.28">crypto currencies they are in big</text>
  <text start="175.43" dur="5.25">trouble and they&amp;#39;re saying that central</text>
  <text start="178.489" dur="4.59">bank&amp;#39;s must maintain the public&amp;#39;s trust</text>
  <text start="180.68" dur="5.7">in fiat currencies and stay in the game</text>
  <text start="183.079" dur="5.451">in a digital sharing and decentralized</text>
  <text start="186.38" dur="5.25">services economy</text>
  <text start="188.53" dur="4.75">now once again their system is not</text>
  <text start="191.63" dur="4.56">decentralized their system is</text>
  <text start="193.28" dur="4.68">centralized they can&amp;#39;t compete with the</text>
  <text start="196.19" dur="3.54">decentralized system because they need</text>
  <text start="197.96" dur="4.29">to have full control over everything</text>
  <text start="199.73" dur="6.15">they need they need to have the control</text>
  <text start="202.25" dur="5.61">of the creation of the currency and with</text>
  <text start="205.88" dur="5.34">cryptocurrency that&amp;#39;s a little bit more</text>
  <text start="207.86" dur="5.76">difficult because it&amp;#39;s not the central</text>
  <text start="211.22" dur="4.62">bank that is creating it it&amp;#39;s miners</text>
  <text start="213.62" dur="3.84">around the world that are creating the</text>
  <text start="215.84" dur="5.46">cryptocurrency now if they get their</text>
  <text start="217.46" dur="6.69">hands on having the cryptocurrency and</text>
  <text start="221.3" dur="5.34">governments pass laws which you know</text>
  <text start="224.15" dur="6.03">they can try to force them to do so they</text>
  <text start="226.64" dur="4.92">did this back in 1913 they bribed and</text>
  <text start="230.18" dur="4.68">they did whatever they had to to get</text>
  <text start="231.56" dur="5.97">their fiat currency into the system they</text>
  <text start="234.86" dur="6.57">might try the same thing but if the</text>
  <text start="237.53" dur="5.85">entire economic system crashes who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.43" dur="5.13">going to believe a central bank who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="243.38" dur="6.09">going to trust a central bank because</text>
  <text start="246.56" dur="6.51">the world will then see that these</text>
  <text start="249.47" dur="6.48">central bankers have put countries into</text>
  <text start="253.07" dur="4.41">debt and imploded each and every one of</text>
  <text start="255.95" dur="4.259">these countries and if we go back in</text>
  <text start="257.48" dur="6.51">time we will now learn that they have</text>
  <text start="260.209" dur="6.031">lied to us during each downturn of the</text>
  <text start="263.99" dur="3.75">economy because they tell us that</text>
  <text start="266.24" dur="4.59">everything is fine and then everything</text>
  <text start="267.74" dur="6.6">starts to fall apart and once we audit</text>
  <text start="270.83" dur="6.23">the Fed what do we find out we will find</text>
  <text start="274.34" dur="4.92">out what they&amp;#39;ve really been doing</text>
  <text start="277.06" dur="3.46">remember they&amp;#39;re not transparent even</text>
  <text start="279.26" dur="3.48">though they&amp;#39;re telling us they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="280.52" dur="3.9">transparent they don&amp;#39;t want anyone</text>
  <text start="282.74" dur="4.47">seeing the inner workings of what</text>
  <text start="284.42" dur="6.42">they&amp;#39;re really doing and they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="287.21" dur="5.82">afraid of any other type of system this</text>
  <text start="290.84" dur="3.9">is why they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating gold</text>
  <text start="293.03" dur="3.72">and silver because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="294.74" dur="4.71">people to realize that gold and silver</text>
  <text start="296.75" dur="4.86">that&amp;#39;s the real money that&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="299.45" dur="4.2">insurance policy and they&amp;#39;ve done this</text>
  <text start="301.61" dur="3.42">for many many years where they suppress</text>
  <text start="303.65" dur="4.5">it because they don&amp;#39;t want people</text>
  <text start="305.03" dur="5.06">looking at it because if they just let</text>
  <text start="308.15" dur="4.29">gold and silver do what it does normally</text>
  <text start="310.09" dur="4.06">gold and silver wouldn&amp;#39;t be at thirteen</text>
  <text start="312.44" dur="3.479">hundred and change it&amp;#39;d be much much</text>
  <text start="314.15" dur="3.66">higher because the value of the dollar</text>
  <text start="315.919" dur="4.5">has decreased currencies around the</text>
  <text start="317.81" dur="3.54">world have decreased and what that means</text>
  <text start="320.419" dur="4.021">is</text>
  <text start="321.35" dur="5.18">well gold moves up in value we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="324.44" dur="5.76">it throughout history</text>
  <text start="326.53" dur="5.92">now the Central Bank of Russia they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="330.2" dur="4.02">saying well crypto assets they do not</text>
  <text start="332.45" dur="4.59">pose a risk to global financial</text>
  <text start="334.22" dur="5.07">stability they&amp;#39;re saying because right</text>
  <text start="337.04" dur="3.63">now cryptocurrencies the market is very</text>
  <text start="339.29" dur="4.5">very small compared to the global</text>
  <text start="340.67" dur="4.44">economy and they&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.79" dur="3.42">really not that big of a worry</text>
  <text start="345.11" dur="3.72">now remember Putin came in and he took</text>
  <text start="347.21" dur="3.66">control of the private western central</text>
  <text start="348.83" dur="5.01">bank in Russia they&amp;#39;re pretty much</text>
  <text start="350.87" dur="5.52">debt-free in that country they call the</text>
  <text start="353.84" dur="5.49">shots it&amp;#39;s not the Rothschilds this is</text>
  <text start="356.39" dur="5.82">why they demonize Russia so much because</text>
  <text start="359.33" dur="3.96">they do not like what Russia did same</text>
  <text start="362.21" dur="4.44">thing with other countries that do not</text>
  <text start="363.29" dur="5.34">have the central banking system and we</text>
  <text start="366.65" dur="4.49">see at this time they&amp;#39;re saying yeah</text>
  <text start="368.63" dur="4.44">cryptocurrencies it&amp;#39;s a good thing and</text>
  <text start="371.14" dur="5.32">it looks like they&amp;#39;re creating</text>
  <text start="373.07" dur="4.98">legislation to regulate to make sure</text>
  <text start="376.46" dur="6.27">that people don&amp;#39;t get hurt with crypto</text>
  <text start="378.05" dur="7.26">currencies and they&amp;#39;re taking the crypto</text>
  <text start="382.73" dur="4.38">market and integrating it into their</text>
  <text start="385.31" dur="3.72">system same thing with China same thing</text>
  <text start="387.11" dur="4.83">with all these countries eventually all</text>
  <text start="389.03" dur="6.45">the countries are going to come aboard</text>
  <text start="391.94" dur="7.71">the crypto currency market and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="395.48" dur="7.32">going to allow the people to use it to</text>
  <text start="399.65" dur="4.83">purchase to get paid in and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="402.8" dur="3.78">already seeing this happen and this is</text>
  <text start="404.48" dur="3.42">just going to grow and it&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="406.58" dur="3.66">larger and larger because what is</text>
  <text start="407.9" dur="5.46">happening right now the entire economic</text>
  <text start="410.24" dur="4.8">system is falling apart it&amp;#39;s crashing we</text>
  <text start="413.36" dur="4.26">have too much debt and we need to</text>
  <text start="415.04" dur="4.17">transition into something else now we</text>
  <text start="417.62" dur="4.98">can either transition into a central</text>
  <text start="419.21" dur="6.63">banking currency or we can transition</text>
  <text start="422.6" dur="4.62">into a people&amp;#39;s currency and I would</text>
  <text start="425.84" dur="3.39">like to see us transition into a</text>
  <text start="427.22" dur="5.3">people&amp;#39;s currency where we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="429.23" dur="6.77">the central banking system we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="432.52" dur="8.67">an institution that is private</text>
  <text start="436" dur="8.53">controlling the currency and the economy</text>
  <text start="441.19" dur="6.34">we don&amp;#39;t need it it&amp;#39;s not necessary</text>
  <text start="444.53" dur="5.58">never needed it the central bankers tell</text>
  <text start="447.53" dur="4.35">us that we need them but if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="450.11" dur="5.01">telling us we need them we really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="451.88" dur="6.69">need them now out in the UK</text>
  <text start="455.12" dur="6.24">the UK posted the worst GDP figures in</text>
  <text start="458.57" dur="5.58">five years on a weak business investment</text>
  <text start="461.36" dur="5.369">in housing and household spending the</text>

  <text start="466.729" dur="7.381">well it&amp;#39;s beginning to show signs of a</text>
  <text start="470.36" dur="5.43">huge amount of strain and in April the</text>
  <text start="474.11" dur="4.86">house sales were down by nine point four</text>
  <text start="475.79" dur="5.58">percent on the previous year in the UK&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="478.97" dur="4.55">most valuable market London house prices</text>
  <text start="481.37" dur="5.04">had their worst month since 2009</text>
  <text start="483.52" dur="5.26">slipping 0.7 percent according to the</text>
  <text start="486.41" dur="6.569">latest figures from the Office for</text>
  <text start="488.78" dur="7.35">National Statistics now on credit demand</text>
  <text start="492.979" dur="7.531">slips some banks have decided to bring</text>
  <text start="496.13" dur="7.02">back a financial relic and every time</text>
  <text start="500.51" dur="6.96">banks start opening it up to subprime</text>
  <text start="503.15" dur="8.22">individuals giving 100% mortgages or</text>
  <text start="507.47" dur="6.059">giving you 3 percent down with no income</text>
  <text start="511.37" dur="3.78">cheque or anything like that you know</text>
  <text start="513.529" dur="3.681">we&amp;#39;re approaching the end game and</text>
  <text start="515.15" dur="4.439">they&amp;#39;re becoming very very desperate and</text>
  <text start="517.21" dur="4.93">this is what we see happening out in the</text>
  <text start="519.589" dur="4.831">UK and they&amp;#39;re bringing back this</text>
  <text start="522.14" dur="4.46">financial relic that should never have</text>
  <text start="524.42" dur="7.669">seen the light of day in the first place</text>
  <text start="526.6" dur="9.52">100% mortgages both Barclays Bank</text>
  <text start="532.089" dur="7.75">decided we&amp;#39;re going to do this and the</text>
  <text start="536.12" dur="7.68">privatized post office they recently</text>
  <text start="539.839" dur="6.781">unveiled 100% mortgage deals now</text>
  <text start="543.8" dur="5.25">mortgages for 100% or above of the</text>
  <text start="546.62" dur="5.55">purchase price not only helped fuel</text>
  <text start="549.05" dur="5.97">octane housing bubbles they also make</text>
  <text start="552.17" dur="5.1">them a lot riskier when some priced when</text>
  <text start="555.02" dur="5.22">home prices decline and when more and</text>
  <text start="557.27" dur="5.7">more borrowers end up with negative</text>
  <text start="560.24" dur="5.75">equity where someone&amp;#39;s home is worth</text>
  <text start="562.97" dur="5.43">less than their debt that in turn</text>
  <text start="565.99" dur="6.55">significantly raises the likelihood of</text>
  <text start="568.4" dur="7.62">borrowers defaulting on their loans and</text>
  <text start="572.54" dur="9.33">that&amp;#39;s why these 100% mortgages are very</text>
  <text start="576.02" dur="9.059">very risky for the banks now today&amp;#39;s new</text>
  <text start="581.87" dur="5.589">breed of 100% mortgages they have a</text>
  <text start="585.079" dur="5.26">little bit of a twist to it and</text>
  <text start="587.459" dur="6.091">what this twist is is that the banks</text>
  <text start="590.339" dur="6.66">need extra security so they&amp;#39;re dragging</text>
  <text start="593.55" dur="5.25">in family members acting as guarantors</text>
  <text start="596.999" dur="3.51">for parts of the loans in other words if</text>
  <text start="598.8" dur="5.31">a borrower falls behind on the</text>
  <text start="600.509" dur="5.911">repayments a parent&amp;#39;s home can also be</text>
  <text start="604.11" dur="5.099">put at risk so what&amp;#39;s happening here is</text>
  <text start="606.42" dur="6.089">the mothers and the fathers they are</text>
  <text start="609.209" dur="4.531">backing these loans to get the 100% they</text>
  <text start="612.509" dur="4.83">have to put their houses up for</text>
  <text start="613.74" dur="5.939">collateral and if the children lose</text>
  <text start="617.339" dur="5.461">their jobs or they can&amp;#39;t pay the loans</text>
  <text start="619.679" dur="4.89">then all of a sudden their house is at</text>
  <text start="622.8" dur="5.879">risk and this is going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="624.569" dur="7.531">and utter nightmare and how widespread</text>
  <text start="628.679" dur="5.431">is this well parents helped provide</text>
  <text start="632.1" dur="3.959">deposits for more than two hundred and</text>
  <text start="634.11" dur="4.289">ninety eight thousand mortgages last</text>
  <text start="636.059" dur="5.041">year that&amp;#39;s equivalent of twenty six</text>
  <text start="638.399" dur="4.951">percent of all transactions and this</text>
  <text start="641.1" dur="6.329">year they&amp;#39;re expecting this to go even</text>
  <text start="643.35" dur="6.75">higher so basically more than one in</text>
  <text start="647.429" dur="4.59">four transactions in the UK&amp;#39;s property</text>
  <text start="650.1" dur="5.94">market this year will depend on the bank</text>
  <text start="652.019" dur="5.67">of mom and dad financial support this is</text>
  <text start="656.04" dur="4.079">going to be a complete another nightmare</text>
  <text start="657.689" dur="4.71">because we see housing bubbles in the UK</text>
  <text start="660.119" dur="4.53">in Australia in Canada and here in the</text>
  <text start="662.399" dur="4.56">United States and this is going to have</text>
  <text start="664.649" dur="4.44">a domino effect and it&amp;#39;s going to run</text>
  <text start="666.959" dur="3.511">rampant throughout the economy it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="669.089" dur="4.261">going to be absolutely awful</text>
  <text start="670.47" dur="5.099">especially when the European nations</text>
  <text start="673.35" dur="7.079">their youth unemployment right now is</text>
  <text start="675.569" dur="7.11">very very high in 11 of the EU nations I</text>
  <text start="680.429" dur="5.991">mean this is just a recipe for disaster</text>
  <text start="682.679" dur="8.64">here and they&amp;#39;re fueling this by</text>
  <text start="686.42" dur="7.18">bringing in subprime 100% mortgages the</text>
  <text start="691.319" dur="4.23">interest rates are rising at the same</text>
  <text start="693.6" dur="3.39">exact time I mean this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="695.549" dur="4.02">going to be a complete another disaster</text>
  <text start="696.99" dur="5.039">here in the United States the employment</text>
  <text start="699.569" dur="5.19">numbers came out and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="702.029" dur="4.5">convince us that we are looking pretty</text>
  <text start="704.759" dur="3.45">darn good I mean the unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="706.529" dur="5.52">came down to three point eight percent</text>
  <text start="708.209" dur="7.35">this is 18 year low they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="712.049" dur="7.211">that we&amp;#39;re in full employment right now</text>
  <text start="715.559" dur="5.711">and everything is fantastic but when you</text>
  <text start="719.26" dur="3.9">really look at it we know that these</text>
  <text start="721.27" dur="3.36">numbers are fake phony and false in the</text>
  <text start="723.16" dur="3.24">first place we&amp;#39;ve gone over this many</text>
  <text start="724.63" dur="3.69">many times the calculation has not</text>
  <text start="726.4" dur="3.54">changed whatsoever they&amp;#39;re still doing</text>
  <text start="728.32" dur="4.2">the same exact tricks there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="729.94" dur="5.1">difference here whatsoever and we could</text>
  <text start="732.52" dur="5.88">see that the labor force participation</text>
  <text start="735.04" dur="5.07">rate well it hit an all-time high ninety</text>
  <text start="738.4" dur="4.2">five point nine one five million and</text>
  <text start="740.11" dur="4.02">this is continually moving up and up and</text>
  <text start="742.6" dur="4.62">up and up which means there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="744.13" dur="5.94">people out of the workplace and adding</text>
  <text start="747.22" dur="4.41">this to the 6.1 million currently</text>
  <text start="750.07" dur="3.9">unemployed Americans there are about a</text>
  <text start="751.63" dur="4.44">hundred and two million Americans who</text>
  <text start="753.97" dur="6.78">are either unemployed or out of the</text>
  <text start="756.07" dur="6.99">labor force completely so basically what</text>
  <text start="760.75" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re doing is those people are no</text>
  <text start="763.06" dur="3.51">longer looking for a job so we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="764.92" dur="3.84">not going to count them and we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="766.57" dur="4.11">going to keep lowering the unemployment</text>
  <text start="768.76" dur="4.62">rate now again we have to look at these</text>
  <text start="770.68" dur="4.77">numbers and really think about it well</text>
  <text start="773.38" dur="6.38">if this is truly the case and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="775.45" dur="4.31">telling us that we&amp;#39;re at full employment</text>
  <text start="780.18" dur="4.93">age is going up because there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="782.85" dur="4.51">shortage of workers we can&amp;#39;t find anyone</text>
  <text start="785.11" dur="4.8">to fill the jobs because we&amp;#39;re at full</text>
  <text start="787.36" dur="3.72">employment so they should be offering a</text>
  <text start="789.91" dur="3.93">lot more money to fill these positions</text>
  <text start="791.08" dur="6.72">but they&amp;#39;re not which is kind of odd</text>
  <text start="793.84" dur="7.32">same thing with why our delinquencies on</text>
  <text start="797.8" dur="5.58">the rise if everyone has a job why is</text>
  <text start="801.16" dur="4.5">retail suffering right now if everyone</text>
  <text start="803.38" dur="4.89">has a job and we discussed the</text>
  <text start="805.66" dur="5.43">brick-and-mortar and online sales and</text>
  <text start="808.27" dur="6.45">all that other stuff there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="811.09" dur="6.15">disconnect here the disconnect is that</text>
  <text start="814.72" dur="5.22">these numbers that they continually feed</text>
  <text start="817.24" dur="6.69">us they&amp;#39;re manipulated and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="819.94" dur="5.55">manipulated for a very long time now we</text>
  <text start="823.93" dur="4.32">see that Deutsche Bank they have a huge</text>
  <text start="825.49" dur="6.39">amount of problems and already what do</text>
  <text start="828.25" dur="7.04">we see well they&amp;#39;ve been placed on the</text>
  <text start="831.88" dur="5.97">list of the Fed which is secret where</text>
  <text start="835.29" dur="5.65">they&amp;#39;re saying that Deutsche Bank is a</text>
  <text start="837.85" dur="6.24">complete and utter disaster SMP they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="840.94" dur="5.64">downgraded Deutsche Bank to triple b+</text>
  <text start="844.09" dur="6.06">and there are three notches away from</text>
  <text start="846.58" dur="5.58">junk and you can see that Georgia Bank</text>
  <text start="850.15" dur="4.59">is getting hit hard right now</text>
  <text start="852.16" dur="4.77">and this is going to spread to other</text>
  <text start="854.74" dur="4.5">banks the Italian banks are in trouble</text>
  <text start="856.93" dur="4.35">Deutsche Bank&amp;#39;s in trouble many other</text>
  <text start="859.24" dur="3.75">European banks were in trouble Spanish</text>
  <text start="861.28" dur="4.56">banks are in trouble they&amp;#39;re just trying</text>
  <text start="862.99" dur="5.49">to hold all this together with spit tape</text>
  <text start="865.84" dur="4.32">and glue here and it&amp;#39;s falling apart all</text>
  <text start="868.48" dur="2.94">over the place and they&amp;#39;re just trying</text>
  <text start="870.16" dur="3.3">to make sure that the whole thing</text>
  <text start="871.42" dur="4.08">doesn&amp;#39;t fall apart because they will</text>
  <text start="873.46" dur="4.11">lose control it will spread to other</text>
  <text start="875.5" dur="3.93">countries because they&amp;#39;re hooked through</text>
  <text start="877.57" dur="4.74">derivatives it is complete another</text>
  <text start="879.43" dur="5.25">nightmare and we know we&amp;#39;re getting to a</text>
  <text start="882.31" dur="6.24">point where this whole entire system is</text>
  <text start="884.68" dur="6.06">going to come down because we talked</text>
  <text start="888.55" dur="4.38">about this before Bank of America they</text>
  <text start="890.74" dur="6.78">came up with this bear market indicator</text>
  <text start="892.93" dur="7.14">and we&amp;#39;ve seen their indicators and</text>
  <text start="897.52" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;ve holed it time and time again</text>
  <text start="900.07" dur="5.1">when the market has come down now let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="903.01" dur="5.67">go back a little bit in time here</text>
  <text start="905.17" dur="6.63">towards the end of January when they</text>
  <text start="908.68" dur="5.79">were using their new bear market</text>
  <text start="911.8" dur="6.15">indicator and everything was at the</text>
  <text start="914.47" dur="6.06">highest point that we&amp;#39;ve seen and they</text>
  <text start="917.95" dur="4.83">said well there&amp;#39;s going to be problems</text>
  <text start="920.53" dur="4.67">the indicator predicted not only the</text>
  <text start="922.78" dur="5.58">size of the upcoming drop which was</text>
  <text start="925.2" dur="6.19">minus 12 percent on average but also</text>
  <text start="928.36" dur="7.53">that timing over the coming three months</text>
  <text start="931.39" dur="7.44">was right on also notable it&amp;#39;s uncanny</text>
  <text start="935.89" dur="5.61">accuracy was correct on eleven out of</text>
  <text start="938.83" dur="4.74">eleven previous occasions after it was</text>
  <text start="941.5" dur="4.89">triggered and this is what Bank of</text>
  <text start="943.57" dur="4.65">America said Bank of America bull and</text>
  <text start="946.39" dur="4.74">bear indicator surges to seven point</text>
  <text start="948.22" dur="4.95">nine highest since cell signal greater</text>
  <text start="951.13" dur="4.47">than eight triggered March 13th</text>
  <text start="953.17" dur="5.22">Bank of America bull and bear indicator</text>
  <text start="955.6" dur="6.78">has given eleven cell signal since 2002</text>
  <text start="958.39" dur="6.45">hit ratio 11 for 11 average equity peak</text>
  <text start="962.38" dur="4.86">to trough dropped following three months</text>
  <text start="964.84" dur="4.89">equals twelve percent note that the last</text>
  <text start="967.24" dur="6.63">bull and bear indicator flashed was a</text>
  <text start="969.73" dur="7.02">buy signal of zero on February 11th 2016</text>
  <text start="973.87" dur="5.13">so fast forward to today when the bear</text>
  <text start="976.75" dur="7.5">market is that much closer according to</text>
  <text start="979" dur="6.51">the Bank of America reports that as of</text>
  <text start="984.25" dur="4.53">this month</text>
  <text start="985.51" dur="3.87">another two indicators they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="988.78" dur="5.28">triggered</text>
  <text start="989.38" dur="9.24">meaning that 13 of the 19 bear market</text>
  <text start="994.06" dur="6.69">signposts are now flashing red so we are</text>
  <text start="998.62" dur="7.08">more than two-thirds of the way to the</text>
  <text start="1000.75" dur="6.72">next crash depression recession and when</text>
  <text start="1005.7" dur="3.45">you look at this and you look at the</text>
  <text start="1007.47" dur="5.16">bear market signals when they were</text>
  <text start="1009.15" dur="8.78">triggered we can see it it was right</text>
  <text start="1012.63" dur="8.43">before 2008 it was right before 2000</text>
  <text start="1017.93" dur="5.59">when we had these recessions and we go</text>
  <text start="1021.06" dur="4.62">back in time and you can see that when</text>
  <text start="1023.52" dur="5.28">they calculated backwards it was</text>
  <text start="1025.68" dur="5.94">triggered every single time and here we</text>
  <text start="1028.8" dur="4.98">are again we&amp;#39;re reaching that point</text>
  <text start="1031.62" dur="5.219">where it&amp;#39;s going to be triggered and</text>
  <text start="1033.78" dur="5.669">every time we speak there&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="1036.839" dur="5.041">trigger being added another indicator</text>
  <text start="1039.449" dur="5.401">being added to this and we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1041.88" dur="5.579">very very close to when all of this is</text>
  <text start="1044.85" dur="5.31">going to start falling apart and this</text>
  <text start="1047.459" dur="4.741">can accelerate at any time because we</text>
  <text start="1050.16" dur="3.93">already see signs out in Europe that</text>
  <text start="1052.2" dur="5.16">things are completely breaking down and</text>
  <text start="1054.09" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re not going well and if Deutsche</text>
  <text start="1057.36" dur="4.14">Bank continually slides I mean we might</text>
  <text start="1059.31" dur="5.22">see a ballon we might see a bailout we</text>
  <text start="1061.5" dur="4.38">don&amp;#39;t know and the ECB is watching all</text>
  <text start="1064.53" dur="2.4">this they know there are problems and I</text>
  <text start="1065.88" dur="2.91">think behind the scenes what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1066.93" dur="3.63">doing is they&amp;#39;re trying to control the</text>
  <text start="1068.79" dur="3.87">situation even though they&amp;#39;re out front</text>
  <text start="1070.56" dur="3.9">telling you that everything looks great</text>
  <text start="1072.66" dur="3.45">now that&amp;#39;s not the case they always do</text>
  <text start="1074.46" dur="4.29">things behind the scenes to try to</text>
  <text start="1076.11" dur="5.28">minimize the damage just like going back</text>
  <text start="1078.75" dur="4.95">to 2008 what was the Fed doing behind</text>
  <text start="1081.39" dur="4.29">the scenes with Bear Stearns with AIG</text>
  <text start="1083.7" dur="3.99">and all the rest they were already</text>
  <text start="1085.68" dur="3.39">planning on giving them bailouts</text>
  <text start="1087.69" dur="4.59">actually they probably funneled them</text>
  <text start="1089.07" dur="5.13">funds already to try to stop what was</text>
  <text start="1092.28" dur="4.17">happening and then it got completely out</text>
  <text start="1094.2" dur="3.84">of control and the whole thing started</text>
  <text start="1096.45" dur="3.6">to spiral downward because it hit other</text>
  <text start="1098.04" dur="3.87">things in the economy and everything</text>
  <text start="1100.05" dur="3.69">started to fall apart and I think here</text>
  <text start="1101.91" dur="4.32">we are once again we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="1103.74" dur="4.98">the same thing but what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="1106.23" dur="4.89">it it&amp;#39;s happening in other places and</text>
  <text start="1108.72" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s going to spread just like it did</text>
  <text start="1111.12" dur="4.71">back in 2008 and it&amp;#39;s just starting at</text>
  <text start="1113.52" dur="3.21">different points so we are moving in</text>
  <text start="1115.83" dur="2.61">that direction</text>
  <text start="1116.73" dur="2.47">so everyone needs to be ready and</text>
