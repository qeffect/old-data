  <text start="94.27" dur="6.209">we know they have free rein to push this</text>
  <text start="97.9" dur="4.079">plan forward and what Trump of the</text>
  <text start="100.479" dur="5.371">Patriots have been doing in the meantime</text>
  <text start="101.979" dur="6.061">is they&amp;#39;ve been blocking every exit for</text>
  <text start="105.85" dur="4.559">the deep state for the central bank and</text>
  <text start="108.04" dur="3.359">they have no place to go they have no</text>
  <text start="110.409" dur="2.761">place to hide</text>
  <text start="111.399" dur="3.54">and we&amp;#39;ll be talking about that in just</text>
  <text start="113.17" dur="5.85">a minute but I wanted to head out to the</text>
  <text start="114.939" dur="7.381">UK because Theresa May she is trying</text>
  <text start="119.02" dur="7.82">once again to push her withdrawal</text>
  <text start="122.32" dur="6.689">agreement for a fourth vote now again</text>
  <text start="126.84" dur="4.239">the individuals in Parliament said</text>
  <text start="129.009" dur="5.491">listen if you&amp;#39;re going to give us your</text>
  <text start="131.079" dur="5.401">plan it can&amp;#39;t be the same exact thing so</text>
  <text start="134.5" dur="4.019">it looks like she&amp;#39;s going to change a</text>
  <text start="136.48" dur="3.539">little bit here and there to make it</text>
  <text start="138.519" dur="3.151">look like it&amp;#39;s a completely different</text>
  <text start="140.019" dur="2.22">plan but we know what this plan is all</text>
  <text start="141.67" dur="4.47">about</text>
  <text start="142.239" dur="7.021">we know this plan is the plan of the EU</text>
  <text start="146.14" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s not the plan for the people and I</text>
  <text start="149.26" dur="3.449">don&amp;#39;t think this plan is going to go</text>
  <text start="151.66" dur="3.389">anywhere</text>
  <text start="152.709" dur="4.351">I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re gonna say hey yes</text>
  <text start="155.049" dur="5.401">we accept it now I think it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="157.06" dur="5.96">voted down and I think after what three</text>
  <text start="160.45" dur="6.26">four times it&amp;#39;s time to end</text>
  <text start="163.02" dur="7.23">I do believe this time period that they</text>
  <text start="166.71" dur="6">have right now is a stall tactic and the</text>
  <text start="170.25" dur="5.34">EU is going to try to stall once again</text>
  <text start="172.71" dur="5.4">and I think the people of the UK need to</text>
  <text start="175.59" dur="5.73">say okay you know what it&amp;#39;s time to</text>
  <text start="178.11" dur="5.67">break away and the EU if they hear this</text>
  <text start="181.32" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re going to try to stop it through</text>
  <text start="183.78" dur="4.62">fear or anything else and we know from</text>
  <text start="186.42" dur="3.87">the past this is what they did when they</text>
  <text start="188.4" dur="3.69">were voting for the brexit if you vote</text>
  <text start="190.29" dur="4.32">for the brexit the economy will</text>
  <text start="192.09" dur="5.16">completely collapse after the vote none</text>
  <text start="194.61" dur="5.91">of this happened what they&amp;#39;re afraid of</text>
  <text start="197.25" dur="5.52">is that if the rest of the world sees</text>
  <text start="200.52" dur="5.7">this country break away from the EU and</text>
  <text start="202.77" dur="5.36">the country does well well the rest of</text>
  <text start="206.22" dur="4.38">the countries that are with the EU</text>
  <text start="208.13" dur="3.82">they&amp;#39;re gonna see this and say we need</text>
  <text start="210.6" dur="2.97">to break away you think Italy&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="211.95" dur="3.45">gonna say hey you know something there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="213.57" dur="3.75">no reason for us to be with you we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="215.4" dur="5.16">breaking away it&amp;#39;s going to be like a</text>
  <text start="217.32" dur="6.05">domino effect and they know this no back</text>
  <text start="220.56" dur="6.75">here in the United States we understand</text>
  <text start="223.37" dur="5.92">that the Patriots Trump they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="227.31" dur="5.07">against time because this central bank</text>
  <text start="229.29" dur="6.57">economy was never designed to go this</text>
  <text start="232.38" dur="5.85">long and this is why Trump has pushed</text>
  <text start="235.86" dur="5.01">for the Federal Reserve to keep the</text>
  <text start="238.23" dur="5.46">interest rates steady do not raise them</text>
  <text start="240.87" dur="4.77">actually I do believe that he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="243.69" dur="3.93">continually tweet out there that he</text>
  <text start="245.64" dur="4.17">wants the rates cut and I think the Fed</text>
  <text start="247.62" dur="4.71">is eventually going to cut the rates and</text>
  <text start="249.81" dur="4.92">then you&amp;#39;re gonna see the ECB cut the</text>
  <text start="252.33" dur="4.409">rates but what we see happening right</text>
  <text start="254.73" dur="4.59">now is that existing home sales which we</text>
  <text start="256.739" dur="6.391">said yesterday they are collapsing new</text>
  <text start="259.32" dur="7.44">home sales in March they soared by 4.5%</text>
  <text start="263.13" dur="6.78">and the reason why they&amp;#39;re soaring is</text>
  <text start="266.76" dur="6.03">because prices are coming down for new</text>
  <text start="269.91" dur="5.61">homes now we need to remember something</text>
  <text start="272.79" dur="5.73">very important that new home purchases</text>
  <text start="275.52" dur="5.91">only account for 10% of the market and</text>
  <text start="278.52" dur="5.28">our calculated when contracts are signed</text>
  <text start="281.43" dur="5.4">so when these individuals decide not to</text>
  <text start="283.8" dur="4.5">go through with it well we have a</text>
  <text start="286.83" dur="3.81">completely different number the next</text>
  <text start="288.3" dur="5.55">month in a month after that but we are</text>
  <text start="290.64" dur="5.91">seeing prices come down now at the same</text>
  <text start="293.85" dur="5.13">time we see mortgage rates</text>
  <text start="296.55" dur="5.61">starting to tick up and this is why I do</text>
  <text start="298.98" dur="5.88">believe that Trump the Patriots they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="302.16" dur="6.18">gonna push the Fed into cutting the</text>
  <text start="304.86" dur="5.91">rates especially if the economy starts</text>
  <text start="308.34" dur="4.14">to decline and things start to get</text>
  <text start="310.77" dur="3.81">really really bad I think they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="312.48" dur="5.25">have the Fed cut rates and I think they</text>
  <text start="314.58" dur="6.92">should do this before way before</text>
  <text start="317.73" dur="6.33">everything starts to go downhill now</text>
  <text start="321.5" dur="5.5">what&amp;#39;s very interesting we know that</text>
  <text start="324.06" dur="6.27">there are certain individuals that are</text>
  <text start="327" dur="5.91">keeping the gold prices down and every</text>
  <text start="330.33" dur="5.13">time we watch this and every time we</text>
  <text start="332.91" dur="6.36">observe this it&amp;#39;s the same thing over</text>
  <text start="335.46" dur="6.72">and over and over again so today around</text>
  <text start="339.27" dur="6.51">8:30 in the morning Eastern Time all of</text>
  <text start="342.18" dur="7.02">a sudden someone dumped 11,500 gold</text>
  <text start="345.78" dur="6.39">future contracts into the market guess</text>
  <text start="349.2" dur="7.17">what that did it brought down the gold</text>
  <text start="352.17" dur="7.74">price and this is around 1.5 billion</text>
  <text start="356.37" dur="6.33">notional of the precious metal so they</text>
  <text start="359.91" dur="5.37">dumped this to bring the price down but</text>
  <text start="362.7" dur="5.25">they couldn&amp;#39;t get it down the way they</text>
  <text start="365.28" dur="4.74">normally did it only came down something</text>
  <text start="367.95" dur="4.59">like eight or nine dollars and then it</text>
  <text start="370.02" dur="5.49">started to tick up once again so as you</text>
  <text start="372.54" dur="5.43">can see their methods well they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="375.51" dur="4.14">working like they used to and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="377.97" dur="3.45">getting harder and harder to keep the</text>
  <text start="379.65" dur="4.02">gold price down but they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="381.42" dur="5.21">continually try why because the central</text>
  <text start="383.67" dur="6.72">banks right now they are accumulating</text>
  <text start="386.63" dur="6.13">gold because they know the fiat currency</text>
  <text start="390.39" dur="4.32">system is dying they also did the same</text>
  <text start="392.76" dur="3.51">thing to silver they dumped the paper</text>
  <text start="394.71" dur="3.75">contracts and they brought silver right</text>
  <text start="396.27" dur="4.92">down now very interestingly there were</text>
  <text start="398.46" dur="5.97">no headlines nothing was going on and at</text>
  <text start="401.19" dur="6.75">the same exact moment they dumped the</text>
  <text start="404.43" dur="7.55">future contracts gold prices decline and</text>
  <text start="407.94" dur="7.65">the dollar increased now every time</text>
  <text start="411.98" dur="6.22">moving forward when they try to dump</text>
  <text start="415.59" dur="4.64">these paper contracts onto the market</text>
  <text start="418.2" dur="4.86">you&amp;#39;re going to see that the gold price</text>
  <text start="420.23" dur="5.02">it doesn&amp;#39;t come down as much as it did</text>
  <text start="423.06" dur="4.62">the last time and you&amp;#39;ll see that it</text>
  <text start="425.25" dur="4.17">becomes harder and harder for them to</text>
  <text start="427.68" dur="2.56">keep the gold price down which means</text>
  <text start="429.42" dur="4.059">they&amp;#39;re gonna have to you</text>
  <text start="430.24" dur="4.769">many more paper contracts to try to</text>
  <text start="433.479" dur="4.681">accomplish the same thing they have been</text>
  <text start="435.009" dur="5.13">doing for many many years and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="438.16" dur="3.479">going to happen eventually is that no</text>
  <text start="440.139" dur="4.201">matter what they throw at the gold</text>
  <text start="441.639" dur="4.59">market the gold price is not going to</text>
  <text start="444.34" dur="4.139">stay down they might bring it down but</text>
  <text start="446.229" dur="7.56">it&amp;#39;s going to pop right back up and this</text>
  <text start="448.479" dur="8.641">is a signal to everyone that gold silver</text>
  <text start="453.789" dur="5.551">is breaking free of the manipulation and</text>
  <text start="457.12" dur="3.63">this is something to watch and if you</text>
  <text start="459.34" dur="3.72">notice they just did this a couple of</text>
  <text start="460.75" dur="5.13">weeks ago and they&amp;#39;re continually trying</text>
  <text start="463.06" dur="4.079">to bring down the gold price because all</text>
  <text start="465.88" dur="3.81">these private western central banks</text>
  <text start="467.139" dur="4.741">around the globe they&amp;#39;re accumulating</text>
  <text start="469.69" dur="4.289">gold China&amp;#39;s accumulating gold Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="471.88" dur="5.039">accumulating gold because they know the</text>
  <text start="473.979" dur="5.301">Fiat system it only has a certain period</text>
  <text start="476.919" dur="4.5">of time left and once that system</text>
  <text start="479.28" dur="4.479">completely starts to buckle under the</text>
  <text start="481.419" dur="5.521">weight of the debt and everything else</text>
  <text start="483.759" dur="4.681">they know they&amp;#39;re going to need gold now</text>
  <text start="486.94" dur="3.629">this doesn&amp;#39;t mean the private western</text>
  <text start="488.44" dur="3.539">central banks are going to control each</text>
  <text start="490.569" dur="3.061">and every one of these countries because</text>
  <text start="491.979" dur="4.111">I think there&amp;#39;s something else planned</text>
  <text start="493.63" dur="5.31">behind the scenes where many countries</text>
  <text start="496.09" dur="5.16">like Russia China the US and many others</text>
  <text start="498.94" dur="6.3">they&amp;#39;re planning to make a move to</text>
  <text start="501.25" dur="6.15">restructure the entire system now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="505.24" dur="4.53">very interesting is that Paul Krugman</text>
  <text start="507.4" dur="4.23">who works for the New York Times who</text>
  <text start="509.77" dur="3.72">writes for the New York Times he</text>
  <text start="511.63" dur="3.149">continually tries to make prediction on</text>
  <text start="513.49" dur="3.15">what&amp;#39;s going to happen with the market</text>
  <text start="514.779" dur="3.901">saying the markets going to crash we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="516.64" dur="4.529">heading into a recession and things like</text>
  <text start="518.68" dur="4.469">that and we need to remember that Paul</text>
  <text start="521.169" dur="5.551">Krugman he was awarded the Nobel</text>
  <text start="523.149" dur="6.271">Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for</text>
  <text start="526.72" dur="6.51">his contribution to new trade theory and</text>
  <text start="529.42" dur="6.75">new economic geography and he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="533.23" dur="4.77">hitting Trump pretty darn hard and Trump</text>
  <text start="536.17" dur="4.5">finally came out and tweeted the</text>
  <text start="538" dur="6.51">following Paul Krugman of the fake New</text>
  <text start="540.67" dur="7.02">York Times has lost all credibility and</text>
  <text start="544.51" dur="5.73">has The Times itself with his false and</text>
  <text start="547.69" dur="4.95">highly inaccurate writings on me he is</text>
  <text start="550.24" dur="3.93">obsessed with hatred just as others are</text>
  <text start="552.64" dur="4.71">obsessed with how stupid he is</text>
  <text start="554.17" dur="6.21">he said market would crash only record</text>
  <text start="557.35" dur="6.419">highs now you have to remember that Paul</text>
  <text start="560.38" dur="5.34">Krugman and the rest of the deep State</text>
  <text start="563.769" dur="6.151">they thought they had complete control</text>
  <text start="565.72" dur="7.5">of the entire system and their plan was</text>
  <text start="569.92" dur="6.419">to bring down the system during the</text>
  <text start="573.22" dur="4.799">presidency of Trump and the way they</text>
  <text start="576.339" dur="3.96">were going to do this is they were going</text>
  <text start="578.019" dur="4.021">to crash the markets raise the interest</text>
  <text start="580.299" dur="3.121">rates and have the markets come down</text>
  <text start="582.04" dur="4.019">have the real estate market come down</text>
  <text start="583.42" dur="4.319">and the whole thing would fall apart and</text>
  <text start="586.059" dur="3.24">when all these individuals were out</text>
  <text start="587.739" dur="4.02">there saying that we&amp;#39;re heading into a</text>
  <text start="589.299" dur="4.32">recession they had the date they had the</text>
  <text start="591.759" dur="4.67">time they knew exactly was going to</text>
  <text start="593.619" dur="5.551">happen it was because they had this plan</text>
  <text start="596.429" dur="4.63">Trump controls the magic wand</text>
  <text start="599.17" dur="4.259">he has his people inside the Federal</text>
  <text start="601.059" dur="5.22">Reserve he&amp;#39;s controlling the Federal</text>
  <text start="603.429" dur="5.76">Reserve and he stopped everything that</text>
  <text start="606.279" dur="5.25">they were planning to do and this is why</text>
  <text start="609.189" dur="5.31">they got it so wrong now think about</text>
  <text start="611.529" dur="5.91">what he&amp;#39;s been doing here he hasn&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="614.499" dur="5.94">just complaining about the Fed he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="617.439" dur="5.791">just pointing the fingers Trump and the</text>
  <text start="620.439" dur="6.5">Patriots they have been blocking all the</text>
  <text start="623.23" dur="6.149">exits for the central bank system</text>
  <text start="626.939" dur="3.87">remember they want the illegals coming</text>
  <text start="629.379" dur="3.57">into the country to increase population</text>
  <text start="630.809" dur="3.671">they didn&amp;#39;t get the president that they</text>
  <text start="632.949" dur="3.42">wanted that was going to bring them to</text>
  <text start="634.48" dur="3.81">war which would then would cover up the</text>
  <text start="636.369" dur="4.291">collapse which will allow the system to</text>

  <text start="646.929" dur="4.561">this system alive Trump decided you know</text>
  <text start="650.139" dur="2.61">something we&amp;#39;re going to build a wall</text>
  <text start="651.49" dur="4.23">they never thought he was going to build</text>
  <text start="652.749" dur="5.34">a wall but he he&amp;#39;s building the wall and</text>
  <text start="655.72" dur="3.419">he&amp;#39;s stopping the illegals from coming</text>
  <text start="658.089" dur="3.66">into the United States and this is a</text>
  <text start="659.139" dur="4.771">problem for the deep state and for the</text>
  <text start="661.749" dur="3.721">central bank because there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="663.91" dur="3.779">agendas associated with the illegals</text>
  <text start="665.47" dur="4.949">coming into this country the same</text>
  <text start="667.689" dur="5.73">problem is is happening in Europe all</text>
  <text start="670.419" dur="4.89">the middle-eastern Wars where they were</text>
  <text start="673.419" dur="4.41">having regime change to prop up the</text>
  <text start="675.309" dur="4.08">petro dollar that is coming to an end</text>
  <text start="677.829" dur="3.87">and the people are taking control of</text>

  <text start="684.16" dur="6.479">to use as payment for this oil now if</text>
  <text start="688.48" dur="5.399">there are no wars within the Middle East</text>
  <text start="690.639" dur="5.28">they don&amp;#39;t have the refugees flowing</text>

  <text start="695.919" dur="3.631">there saying you know something</text>
  <text start="697.78" dur="6.24">we should pay for the refugees from</text>
  <text start="699.55" dur="6.87">Africa to come up to Europe and this is</text>
  <text start="704.02" dur="5.49">because they don&amp;#39;t have these people in</text>
  <text start="706.42" dur="5.28">the Middle East to flood into the</text>
  <text start="709.51" dur="4.29">European countries so everything that</text>
  <text start="711.7" dur="4.23">they were trying to do is coming to an</text>

  <text start="722.47" dur="4.26">just controlling the Federal Reserve but</text>
  <text start="724.36" dur="4.92">controlling the ECB because those</text>
  <text start="726.73" dur="5.7">central banks they&amp;#39;re following what the</text>
  <text start="729.28" dur="4.8">Federal Reserve does think about it the</text>
  <text start="732.43" dur="5.07">Federal Reserve was raising rates and</text>
  <text start="734.08" dur="5.46">the ECB later on was going to start to</text>
  <text start="737.5" dur="5.46">raise rates and this was going to bring</text>
  <text start="739.54" dur="5.1">down the entire European countries and</text>
  <text start="742.96" dur="3.09">then it was gonna flood back here to the</text>

  <text start="746.05" dur="2.85">going to crash</text>
  <text start="746.86" dur="5.49">now that the Federal Reserve is in a</text>
  <text start="748.9" dur="6.48">holding pattern the ECB is in a holding</text>
  <text start="752.35" dur="7.08">pattern when the Federal Reserve cuts</text>
  <text start="755.38" dur="6.6">rates the ECB is going to cut rates so</text>
  <text start="759.43" dur="6.99">you can see there&amp;#39;s complete and total</text>
  <text start="761.98" dur="7.71">control of the central bank system Trump</text>
  <text start="766.42" dur="7.11">is dictating to them what is coming next</text>
  <text start="769.69" dur="6.57">and what is coming next is a complete</text>
  <text start="773.53" dur="6.059">reversal of what they have been planning</text>
  <text start="776.26" dur="4.62">because all their exits are completely</text>
  <text start="779.589" dur="4.351">blocked everything that they were trying</text>
  <text start="780.88" dur="5.84">to do it&amp;#39;s blocked they have no place to</text>
  <text start="783.94" dur="6.66">go and they&amp;#39;re completely exposed and</text>
  <text start="786.72" dur="6.61">the next stage is to have a crisis yes</text>
  <text start="790.6" dur="5.4">there&amp;#39;s going to be a crisis but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="793.33" dur="6.45">going to be a crisis that is controlled</text>
  <text start="796" dur="5.07">and pushed forward to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="799.78" dur="4.14">central bank it&amp;#39;s not going to be a</text>
  <text start="801.07" dur="4.47">crisis that hurts the everyday person</text>
  <text start="803.92" dur="3.87">yes there are certain people that going</text>
  <text start="805.54" dur="5.1">to be hurt because we&amp;#39;re gonna be moving</text>
  <text start="807.79" dur="6.42">out of this central bank economy and</text>
  <text start="810.64" dur="6.12">moving into a new economy that is being</text>
  <text start="814.21" dur="4.83">developed by the Patriots where there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="816.76" dur="4.65">going to be trade where there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="819.04" dur="4.799">be sound money where there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="821.41" dur="4.13">better deals where there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="823.839" dur="4.351">incentives to bring companies</text>
  <text start="825.54" dur="6.08">manufacturers back to this country to</text>
  <text start="828.19" dur="7.41">repopulate those areas that were strip</text>
  <text start="831.62" dur="7.47">by the removal of all these companies</text>
  <text start="835.6" dur="7.03">but there will be a transition period</text>
  <text start="839.09" dur="5.82">that certain people they&amp;#39;re gonna have a</text>
  <text start="842.63" dur="4.17">difficult time transitioning but what I</text>
  <text start="844.91" dur="3.63">do believe is happening is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="846.8" dur="3.78">trying to make it as easy as possible</text>
  <text start="848.54" dur="3.14">and of course they can&amp;#39;t make it perfect</text>
  <text start="850.58" dur="4.17">that&amp;#39;s impossible</text>
  <text start="851.68" dur="4.54">there&amp;#39;s going to be individuals that are</text>
  <text start="854.75" dur="3.93">going to struggle through this period of</text>
  <text start="856.22" dur="4.98">time but once we get to the other side</text>
  <text start="858.68" dur="5.46">and everything starts to click into</text>
  <text start="861.2" dur="6.12">place and the economy comes back online</text>
  <text start="864.14" dur="6.03">and gold or whatever they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="867.32" dur="4.56">use to stabilize the system once that</text>
  <text start="870.17" dur="3.63">happens we&amp;#39;re going to see things</text>
  <text start="871.88" dur="4.47">completely changing those people that</text>
  <text start="873.8" dur="4.74">were hurting well they&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="876.35" dur="4.2">things start getting better now if you</text>
  <text start="878.54" dur="3.69">want to protect yourself going through</text>
  <text start="880.55" dur="4.71">this transition to make it a lot easier</text>
  <text start="882.23" dur="5.13">I would make sure you have prepping</text>
  <text start="885.26" dur="4.17">supplies and prepping supplies is just</text>
  <text start="887.36" dur="4.98">not food or medical supplies prepping</text>
  <text start="889.43" dur="6.57">supplies are purchasing gold and silver</text>
  <text start="892.34" dur="6.6">to ensure your wealth maybe even having</text>
  <text start="896" dur="4.74">crypto currencies they&amp;#39;re both on the</text>
  <text start="898.94" dur="4.2">same page the central bank hates them</text>
  <text start="900.74" dur="4.2">they can&amp;#39;t stand it because they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="903.14" dur="4.86">control it if they could they would come</text>
  <text start="904.94" dur="4.8">out with a cryptocurrency and and say ok</text>
  <text start="908" dur="4.41">world this is the one that you&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="909.74" dur="5">that&amp;#39;s that they just can&amp;#39;t allow a</text>
  <text start="912.41" dur="5.55">cryptocurrency to be free and open in</text>
  <text start="914.74" dur="5.5">the entire world because there&amp;#39;d be no</text>
  <text start="917.96" dur="5.13">reason for them and they can&amp;#39;t have that</text>
  <text start="920.24" dur="4.8">they can&amp;#39;t have gold because why then</text>
  <text start="923.09" dur="4.35">would we need the central bank we</text>
  <text start="925.04" dur="5.79">wouldn&amp;#39;t and this is what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="927.44" dur="8.19">trying to stop all along the plan is on</text>
  <text start="930.83" dur="7.8">track the exits are blocked and every</text>
  <text start="935.63" dur="4.44">single person needs to be ready for this</text>
  <text start="938.63" dur="3.33">transition that we&amp;#39;re going to be going</text>
  <text start="940.07" dur="5.18">through and it&amp;#39;s going to be completely</text>
  <text start="941.96" dur="5.91">different than if someone else was as</text>
  <text start="945.25" dur="4.9">president if the central bank had</text>
  <text start="947.87" dur="4.41">control because they were going to make</text>
  <text start="950.15" dur="4.68">it miserable for the everyday person</text>
  <text start="952.28" dur="5.22">they were going to strip everyone of</text>
