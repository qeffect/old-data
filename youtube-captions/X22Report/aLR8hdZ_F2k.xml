  <text start="83.34" dur="7.319">Apple and this whole sharad of why the</text>
  <text start="87.27" dur="5.19">FBI needs the keys to the kingdom and of</text>
  <text start="90.659" dur="4.081">course this was part of their agenda to</text>
  <text start="92.46" dur="5.189">make everyone feel that if they had the</text>
  <text start="94.74" dur="4.89">keys we could keep you all safe now</text>
  <text start="97.649" dur="4.08">there are many different hackers that</text>
  <text start="99.63" dur="6">came out and said listen they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="101.729" dur="6.39">easy it&amp;#39;s very easy to unlock the Apple</text>
  <text start="105.63" dur="6.3">cell phone if you had the physical</text>
  <text start="108.119" dur="6.451">device it&amp;#39;s easily done John McAfee came</text>
  <text start="111.93" dur="6.66">out he demonstrated that yes this can be</text>
  <text start="114.57" dur="7.31">done and we see the FBI has decided to</text>
  <text start="118.59" dur="6">get assistance from Israel&amp;#39;s cell Brite</text>
  <text start="121.88" dur="4.839">company they are provider of mobile</text>
  <text start="124.59" dur="5.37">forensic software which is now helping</text>
  <text start="126.719" dur="6.571">the feds in their attempt to unlock this</text>
  <text start="129.96" dur="4.98">iPhone now of course they need to get</text>
  <text start="133.29" dur="4.11">into this iPhone to see what&amp;#39;s in there</text>
  <text start="134.94" dur="5.22">to see what the San Bernardino shooters</text>
  <text start="137.4" dur="4.98">were up to and they&amp;#39;ve been making a</text>
  <text start="140.16" dur="3.78">really big stink about this entire thing</text>
  <text start="142.38" dur="3.36">and they were trying to push an agenda</text>
  <text start="143.94" dur="4.2">which was going absolutely nowhere and</text>
  <text start="145.74" dur="4.17">this is why I think they&amp;#39;re in fact off</text>
  <text start="148.14" dur="4.53">because they realized the American</text>
  <text start="149.91" dur="4.29">people are not with the FBI they were</text>
  <text start="152.67" dur="5.52">getting no traction on this whatsoever</text>
  <text start="154.2" dur="7.53">so they needed a way out of this and we</text>
  <text start="158.19" dur="5.26">see at this point in time is that they</text>
  <text start="161.73" dur="5.96">don&amp;#39;t need access</text>
  <text start="163.45" dur="7.78">to everyone&amp;#39;s cell phone if there is a</text>
  <text start="167.69" dur="5.43">real criminal a real terrorists they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="171.23" dur="4.71">not going to be using their everyday</text>
  <text start="173.12" dur="5.49">devices think back to the time when</text>
  <text start="175.94" dur="5.13">there was no cell phones what did people</text>
  <text start="178.61" dur="5.88">use they use ciphers they made up</text>
  <text start="181.07" dur="5.07">different ways of signaling whatever</text>
  <text start="184.49" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re going to do it&amp;#39;s the same thing</text>
  <text start="186.14" dur="3.41">today don&amp;#39;t you think the criminals and</text>
  <text start="187.58" dur="4.47">the terrorists they realize that hey</text>
  <text start="189.55" dur="5.32">maybe I shouldn&amp;#39;t use Facebook and</text>
  <text start="192.05" dur="6.84">Twitter and my cell phone to coordinate</text>
  <text start="194.87" dur="8.82">an attack no an advanced actor would</text>
  <text start="198.89" dur="8.16">never do this this whole thing was fake</text>
  <text start="203.69" dur="5.16">phony and false it was to give up your</text>
  <text start="207.05" dur="8.33">rights that&amp;#39;s what they were pushing and</text>
  <text start="208.85" dur="9.38">it failed now out in Ukraine we see that</text>
  <text start="215.38" dur="7.15">German Foreign Minister frank-walter</text>
  <text start="218.23" dur="9.91">Steinmeier has said that the escalation</text>
  <text start="222.53" dur="9.239">in Ukraine the conflict there could</text>
  <text start="228.14" dur="6.69">occur at any time because he&amp;#39;s seeing</text>
  <text start="231.769" dur="7.081">multiple ceasefire violations and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="234.83" dur="9.09">saying that this could escalate to a</text>

  <text start="303.199" dur="6.661">come out now was this an accident I</text>
  <text start="306.52" dur="4.989">really don&amp;#39;t think so we know this is</text>
  <text start="309.86" dur="4.23">the bridge where they&amp;#39;re building</text>
  <text start="311.509" dur="7.861">they&amp;#39;re bringing in the electrical lines</text>
  <text start="314.09" dur="6.87">and we know that Ukraine right now has</text>
  <text start="319.37" dur="3.78">been shutting off the power shutting off</text>
  <text start="320.96" dur="6.359">the water they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="323.15" dur="7.799">possibly can to put pressure on Crimea</text>
  <text start="327.319" dur="6.271">and we know what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="330.949" dur="7.201">here they&amp;#39;re trying to push their agenda</text>
  <text start="333.59" dur="8.069">and they want another war they want</text>
  <text start="338.15" dur="5.85">Crimea they want the south eastern area</text>
  <text start="341.659" dur="4.651">of Ukraine the central bankers didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="344" dur="5.61">get what they paid for what they paid</text>
  <text start="346.31" dur="10.02">for was the entire country what Joe</text>
  <text start="349.61" dur="10.769">Biden and John Kerry wanted was the gas</text>
  <text start="356.33" dur="6.54">pipelines where their investments would</text>
  <text start="360.379" dur="4.981">flourish because they would control the</text>
  <text start="362.87" dur="4.109">gas going into Europe remember Joe</text>
  <text start="365.36" dur="3.57">Biden&amp;#39;s son was put onto the board of</text>
  <text start="366.979" dur="5.071">directors right after the coup d&amp;#39;etat</text>
  <text start="368.93" dur="9.539">John Kerry&amp;#39;s roommate was brought in</text>
  <text start="372.05" dur="9.78">right after the coup d&amp;#39;etat now we see</text>
  <text start="378.469" dur="5.13">out in Yemen it looks like there is a</text>
  <text start="381.83" dur="5.639">possible ceasefire that might take</text>
  <text start="383.599" dur="6.901">effect on April 10th and the reason for</text>
  <text start="387.469" dur="5.67">this is because Saudi Arabia has been</text>
  <text start="390.5" dur="6.93">making no headway whatsoever in Yemen</text>
  <text start="393.139" dur="8.731">now the US military they have stepped in</text>
  <text start="397.43" dur="6.419">to try to help out and maybe change the</text>
  <text start="401.87" dur="5.729">tide of what is happening in Yemen the</text>
  <text start="403.849" dur="7.021">US military conducted airstrikes on al</text>
  <text start="407.599" dur="5.19">Qaeda training camps in Yemen and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="410.87" dur="4.319">getting reports that there&amp;#39;s 70 that</text>
  <text start="412.789" dur="7.231">were killed 40 civilians that were</text>
  <text start="415.189" dur="9.361">killed now remember the way the US looks</text>
  <text start="420.02" dur="8.009">at this is if you are against the puppet</text>
  <text start="424.55" dur="5.47">government they designate they designate</text>
  <text start="428.029" dur="6.391">you as a terrorist or al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="430.02" dur="8.16">and they did this in Libya Lebanon Iraq</text>
  <text start="434.42" dur="6.55">Yemen of course if they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="438.18" dur="7.14">overthrow an elected government like in</text>
  <text start="440.97" dur="5.82">Syria they use al-qaeda the Islamic</text>
  <text start="445.32" dur="7.32">state and other terrorist organizations</text>
  <text start="446.79" dur="7.29">to help out so in reality the al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="452.64" dur="2.85">Islamic state and other terrorist</text>
  <text start="454.08" dur="3.75">organizations that are trying to</text>
  <text start="455.49" dur="5.52">overthrow the elected government they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="457.83" dur="5.31">paid mercenaries when they look at a</text>
  <text start="461.01" dur="5.19">country where they already have a puppet</text>
  <text start="463.14" dur="4.23">government it&amp;#39;s the people that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="466.2" dur="3.24">calling al-qaeda because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="467.37" dur="4.89">legislation that says the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="469.44" dur="5.91">allowed to use force on terrorist</text>
  <text start="472.26" dur="5.01">organizations in these countries mainly</text>
  <text start="475.35" dur="3.84">al-qaeda the new legislation the</text>
  <text start="477.27" dur="3.48">authorization for war allows them to go</text>
  <text start="479.19" dur="3">after the Islamic state or any other</text>
  <text start="480.75" dur="3.84">terrorist organization but that wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="482.19" dur="4.56">that one is not passed right now so it</text>
  <text start="484.59" dur="4.02">looks like the u.s. is going in and they</text>
  <text start="486.75" dur="4.11">are bombing and doing whatever it</text>
  <text start="488.61" dur="4.71">whatever they possibly can to try to</text>
  <text start="490.86" dur="5.76">help out in the situation so now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="493.32" dur="5.52">getting involved in Yemen now we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="496.62" dur="5.72">to see when April 10th comes if the</text>
  <text start="498.84" dur="7.8">ceasefire holds because Saudi Arabia is</text>
  <text start="502.34" dur="8.41">not making any headway whatsoever in</text>
  <text start="506.64" dur="6.99">Yemen at this point now the u.s. bombed</text>
  <text start="510.75" dur="4.11">the University of Muscle saying that</text>
  <text start="513.63" dur="7.47">this was an Islamic state headquarters</text>
  <text start="514.86" dur="8.31">and what we&amp;#39;re realizing is that there</text>
  <text start="521.1" dur="5.16">were students inside there were</text>
  <text start="523.17" dur="5.16">civilians inside the university and</text>
  <text start="526.26" dur="6.44">they&amp;#39;re getting reports that there are</text>
  <text start="528.33" dur="7.62">25 civilians that were killed here and</text>
  <text start="532.7" dur="6.46">the US government seems to do this quite</text>
  <text start="535.95" dur="4.32">a bit where they say oh there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="539.16" dur="2.73">Islamic state in here</text>
  <text start="540.27" dur="4.53">let&amp;#39;s go bomb it look what happened in</text>
  <text start="541.89" dur="5.7">the hospital in Afghanistan and it seems</text>
  <text start="544.8" dur="5.01">like the u.s. continually hits the areas</text>
  <text start="547.59" dur="3.24">where there are civilians now of course</text>
  <text start="549.81" dur="5.01">the corporate media is not going to</text>
  <text start="550.83" dur="6.26">report on this but what we&amp;#39;re realizing</text>
  <text start="554.82" dur="4.86">is that it is illegal under</text>
  <text start="557.09" dur="5.4">international law to deliberately target</text>
  <text start="559.68" dur="4.259">civilian institutions unless there is</text>
  <text start="562.49" dur="4.719">unequivocal</text>
  <text start="563.939" dur="5.25">hurry justification such as preventing</text>
  <text start="567.209" dur="4.761">an imminent attack and so far in all</text>
  <text start="569.189" dur="5.19">these cases they haven&amp;#39;t had this</text>
  <text start="571.97" dur="4.109">according to Rome Statute of the</text>
  <text start="574.379" dur="4.17">International Criminal Court</text>
  <text start="576.079" dur="4.03">intentionally directing attacks against</text>
  <text start="578.549" dur="5.55">buildings dedicated to religion</text>
  <text start="580.109" dur="8.31">education art science charitable paces</text>
  <text start="584.099" dur="6.69">is a serious war crime and right now</text>
  <text start="588.419" dur="5.16">it&amp;#39;s starting to look like that the</text>
  <text start="590.789" dur="7.77">university muscle it&amp;#39;s just a school</text>
  <text start="593.579" dur="9.21">that&amp;#39;s all it was and the u.s. might be</text>
  <text start="598.559" dur="6.48">brought up on war crimes over this just</text>
  <text start="602.789" dur="4.71">like in the hospital scenario and</text>
  <text start="605.039" dur="6.69">Afghanistan just like the different</text>
  <text start="607.499" dur="7.08">areas in Syria and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="611.729" dur="5.01">a pattern here we&amp;#39;re starting to see a</text>
  <text start="614.579" dur="4.65">pattern where the US will do whatever</text>
  <text start="616.739" dur="6.54">they have to to try to keep the puppet</text>
  <text start="619.229" dur="8.37">government in power they try to keep</text>
  <text start="623.279" dur="7.38">their proxy army in the country they</text>
  <text start="627.599" dur="6.81">want it to be in to create chaos because</text>
  <text start="630.659" dur="8.34">they will need them later on to remove</text>
  <text start="634.409" dur="7.47">Assad and to overthrow any elected</text>
  <text start="638.999" dur="5.76">government now as we know turkey is</text>
  <text start="641.879" dur="6.15">continually putting pressure on the</text>
  <text start="644.759" dur="5.49">Kurds they&amp;#39;re bombing the Kurds they</text>
  <text start="648.029" dur="6.06">have curfews within turkey wherever the</text>
  <text start="650.249" dur="6.83">Kurds are located and Russia is coming</text>
  <text start="654.089" dur="6.06">out saying that Ankara Turkey is</text>
  <text start="657.079" dur="6.46">hindering the Kurdish forces in their</text>
  <text start="660.149" dur="5.58">fight against the Islamic state this is</text>
  <text start="663.539" dur="6.181">why they&amp;#39;re bombing them in Syria</text>
  <text start="665.729" dur="5.7">bombing them in Iraq because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="669.72" dur="5.699">actually going after the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="671.429" dur="6.66">and we see at this point that turkey is</text>
  <text start="675.419" dur="3.9">trying to keep their proxy Army which is</text>
  <text start="678.089" dur="3.57">the proxy army of the United States</text>
  <text start="679.319" dur="6">government central bankers Israel Turkey</text>
  <text start="681.659" dur="5.28">UK and the coalition forces and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="685.319" dur="4.62">trying to keep them alive</text>
  <text start="686.939" dur="6.54">and this is why Turkey has been bombing</text>
  <text start="689.939" dur="5.52">keeping the car door open so they have</text>
  <text start="693.479" dur="3.451">easy access into Turkey whenever they</text>
  <text start="695.459" dur="6.691">need to escape</text>
  <text start="696.93" dur="9.48">get reinforcements get supplies and we</text>
  <text start="702.15" dur="6.27">see right now that turkey is continually</text>
  <text start="706.41" dur="5.34">saying that Isis is attacking them</text>
  <text start="708.42" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re bombing them they&amp;#39;re saying it</text>
  <text start="711.75" dur="5.16">in northern Iraq they&amp;#39;re saying it on</text>
  <text start="714" dur="4.59">the border of Syria and that turkey</text>
  <text start="716.91" dur="7.92">needs to retaliate now this whole thing</text>
  <text start="718.59" dur="8.25">is being ginned up to start war in these</text>
  <text start="724.83" dur="5.04">areas because remember the goal is</text>

  <text start="737.34" dur="5.88">all of this we see their main goal is</text>
  <text start="740.55" dur="4.86">the same to remove Assad this is why</text>

  <text start="747.33" dur="6.9">continually harp on is the transition of</text>
  <text start="749.85" dur="8.28">Assad Kerry is out in Russia he wants to</text>
  <text start="754.23" dur="5.43">clarify from Putin and Lavrov where</text>

  <text start="759.66" dur="5.97">transition for Syria particularly Assad</text>
  <text start="763.59" dur="4.26">now I know Russia has made this</text>
  <text start="765.63" dur="6.06">perfectly clear saying that listen the</text>
  <text start="767.85" dur="6.03">people must decide if Assad stays or it</text>
  <text start="771.69" dur="5.1">goes it&amp;#39;s not up to another country or</text>
  <text start="773.88" dur="4.32">another group now of course the United</text>
  <text start="776.79" dur="3.39">States they don&amp;#39;t want to hear this</text>

  <text start="1131.46" dur="5.7">and more information is coming out and</text>
  <text start="1134.06" dur="5.47">it&amp;#39;s leading us to the conclusion that</text>

  <text start="1139.53" dur="9.63">flags to put fear in Europe and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1145.77" dur="4.37">very interesting is that before the bomb</text>
  <text start="1149.16" dur="3.3">went off</text>
  <text start="1150.14" dur="5.05">Brussels news media reported on the</text>
  <text start="1152.46" dur="4.47">terror attacks by providing CC camera</text>
  <text start="1155.19" dur="5.31">Airport surveillance video on the terror</text>
  <text start="1156.93" dur="7.26">attacks the published video footage was</text>
  <text start="1160.5" dur="6.57">fake the video that they put out was a</text>
  <text start="1164.19" dur="7.65">terror attack at Moscow&amp;#39;s Airport on</text>
  <text start="1167.07" dur="8.88">January 24th 2011 and what they did was</text>
  <text start="1171.84" dur="7.13">they took the date which was March 22nd</text>
  <text start="1175.95" dur="5.85">of 2016 and put it on this video and</text>
  <text start="1178.97" dur="7.35">then they said yes this is the bombing</text>
  <text start="1181.8" dur="9.18">and what&amp;#39;s happening here in Brussels</text>
  <text start="1186.32" dur="9.31">now we see a lot of this and most of the</text>
  <text start="1190.98" dur="6.3">time they get caught in doing this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1195.63" dur="3.03">almost like when we look back in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1197.28" dur="3.71">when they said Russia was invading</text>
  <text start="1198.66" dur="5.79">Ukraine and they showed pictures back</text>
  <text start="1200.99" dur="6.73">with Russian tanks from 2009 which we</text>
  <text start="1204.45" dur="4.38">documented they&amp;#39;re doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="1207.72" dur="3.68">but this time they got caught because</text>
  <text start="1208.83" dur="6.18">what happened was the video was posted</text>
  <text start="1211.4" dur="5.71">at around 9 o 7:00 a.m. local time the</text>
  <text start="1215.01" dur="4.98">attacks took place approximately 8:00</text>
  <text start="1217.11" dur="5.78">a.m. local time the video was identified</text>
  <text start="1219.99" dur="6.33">as an airport CC surveillance but</text>
  <text start="1222.89" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re not going to take the recordings</text>
  <text start="1226.32" dur="5.13">and put them up that quickly because</text>
  <text start="1229.04" dur="5.84">security has to look at it</text>
  <text start="1231.45" dur="4.63">others have to look at it and then they</text>
  <text start="1234.88" dur="4.05">started comparing this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1236.08" dur="5.31">saying okay this is a complete fake say</text>
  <text start="1238.93" dur="4.83">they were trying to convince people who</text>
  <text start="1241.39" dur="6.36">knows what plan they had here but it was</text>
  <text start="1243.76" dur="8.6">completely fake now right after the bomb</text>
  <text start="1247.75" dur="7.14">went off within the 24 hours to 36 hours</text>
  <text start="1252.36" dur="4.69">we know this is a false flag because</text>
  <text start="1254.89" dur="6.57">they find all the evidence very very</text>
  <text start="1257.05" dur="5.97">quickly they went into an apartment they</text>
  <text start="1261.46" dur="3.42">found the ISIS flag they found</text>
  <text start="1263.02" dur="5.49">bomb-making material they found</text>
  <text start="1264.88" dur="6.45">chemicals then they found a computer</text>
  <text start="1268.51" dur="8.19">which is which was in a trash can</text>
  <text start="1271.33" dur="8.16">and the terrace wrote that he felt</text>
  <text start="1276.7" dur="5.04">increasingly unsafe didn&amp;#39;t know what to</text>
  <text start="1279.49" dur="3.48">do and feared to going to prison well if</text>
  <text start="1281.74" dur="4.28">he feared to go in in prison why do you</text>
  <text start="1282.97" dur="7.56">blow himself up that makes no sense</text>
  <text start="1286.02" dur="7.63">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="1290.53" dur="8.88">they&amp;#39;re trying to cover this and point</text>
  <text start="1293.65" dur="7.53">the finger at the patsies and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1299.41" dur="4.65">doing this and all the evidence is right</text>
  <text start="1301.18" dur="4.65">there in front of them and it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="1304.06" dur="4.02">found very very quickly now every time</text>
  <text start="1305.83" dur="4.77">we see the evidence found this quickly</text>
  <text start="1308.08" dur="5.34">we know it&amp;#39;s a false flag all we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1310.6" dur="4.5">waiting for is the intact passports that</text>
  <text start="1313.42" dur="5.28">we found maybe taped to a bathroom wall</text>
  <text start="1315.1" dur="5.7">near a toilet because we always find the</text>
  <text start="1318.7" dur="3.78">passports later on but this time they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1320.8" dur="3.21">already identified the people so they</text>
  <text start="1322.48" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t really need the passports but it</text>
  <text start="1324.01" dur="4.32">would it be funny if they did find them</text>
  <text start="1326.2" dur="6.21">just to complete the whole entire false</text>
  <text start="1328.33" dur="5.58">flag story now why did this happen</text>
  <text start="1332.41" dur="5.76">in Brussels because I mentioned this</text>
  <text start="1333.91" dur="8.01">yesterday and we know that Russia and</text>
  <text start="1338.17" dur="5.79">Syria they are the main enemy of the</text>
  <text start="1341.92" dur="3.33">Islamic state they&amp;#39;ve been driving them</text>
  <text start="1343.96" dur="2.25">back and we know it&amp;#39;s not a terrorist</text>
  <text start="1345.25" dur="3.54">group but let&amp;#39;s pretend it is a</text>
  <text start="1346.21" dur="4.92">terrorist group and Russia has been</text>
  <text start="1348.79" dur="4.23">bombing them they have been shutting</text>
  <text start="1351.13" dur="5.31">down their convoy where they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1353.02" dur="7.62">their covert money supply to keep the</text>
  <text start="1356.44" dur="7.93">operations going why would they go to</text>
  <text start="1360.64" dur="6.19">Brussels Brussels warren well there</text>
  <text start="1364.37" dur="5.52">attacking them it makes no sense well</text>
  <text start="1366.83" dur="4.71">you have to look at it in this way since</text>
  <text start="1369.89" dur="4.59">this is not a terrorist group and</text>
  <text start="1371.54" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re trying to push an agenda they</text>
  <text start="1374.48" dur="5.64">did this in Brussels because this is</text>
  <text start="1376.73" dur="6.72">kind of like the center of the European</text>

  <text start="1412.19" dur="4.5">thinking doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense the only</text>
  <text start="1414.47" dur="6.33">reason they do this is to bring more</text>
  <text start="1416.69" dur="8.489">forces in to get Assad and this is</text>
  <text start="1420.8" dur="6.69">exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing because they</text>
