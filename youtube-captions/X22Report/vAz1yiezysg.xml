  <text start="51.73" dur="5.52">geopolitical news now we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="54.489" dur="5.07">about the Orlando event and as we get</text>
  <text start="57.25" dur="4.14">more and more evidence we are starting</text>
  <text start="59.559" dur="3.421">to realize that this was a complete</text>
  <text start="61.39" dur="3.479">false flag and it looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="62.98" dur="5.82">following the pattern of the San</text>
  <text start="64.869" dur="5.581">Bernardino false flag event remember</text>
  <text start="68.8" dur="4.35">back in San Bernardino where they</text>
  <text start="70.45" dur="6.33">allowed the press to go through the</text>
  <text start="73.15" dur="6.78">shooters home mess with all the evidence</text>
  <text start="76.78" dur="7.43">they planted things in there so it would</text>
  <text start="79.93" dur="7.41">be found now normally during a</text>
  <text start="84.21" dur="4.78">high-profile crime or even just a crime</text>

  <text start="94.96" dur="4.29">they have to go back and collect</text>
  <text start="96.49" dur="5.129">evidence well it looks like we&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="99.25" dur="7.67">the same thing happen with the orlando</text>
  <text start="101.619" dur="9.021">patsy because what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="106.92" dur="10.93">they left the doors unlocked the press</text>
  <text start="110.64" dur="10.6">was allowed into the home of omar and we</text>
  <text start="117.85" dur="7.29">can see right now that there was no</text>
  <text start="121.24" dur="8.25">police tape up there was no barricades</text>
  <text start="125.14" dur="7.02">and a slew of reporters they rummaged</text>
  <text start="129.49" dur="5.84">through the shooters belongings they</text>
  <text start="132.16" dur="8.15">snap pictures they touched everything</text>
  <text start="135.33" dur="7.12">they went into each and every room and</text>
  <text start="140.31" dur="4.63">contaminated the area this is exactly</text>
  <text start="142.45" dur="4.74">what they wanted to happen because they</text>
  <text start="144.94" dur="5.67">wanted them to mess with the evidence</text>
  <text start="147.19" dur="6.39">because there was none they also planted</text>
  <text start="150.61" dur="4.5">different information so we would be</text>
  <text start="153.58" dur="3.86">found and people would look and say oh</text>
  <text start="155.11" dur="5.969">look the Islamic state oh look you know</text>
  <text start="157.44" dur="6.85">is looking at Islam and all these other</text>
  <text start="161.079" dur="3.421">things and we can see right now all of</text>
  <text start="164.29" dur="2.97">the</text>
  <text start="164.5" dur="5.81">is being done because this entire thing</text>
  <text start="167.26" dur="6.69">is a false flag now the FBI came out</text>
  <text start="170.31" dur="6.88">with 911 call transcripts now it was</text>
  <text start="173.95" dur="6.75">redacted they removed a lot of the words</text>
  <text start="177.19" dur="6.72">from it and then the public screamed out</text>
  <text start="180.7" dur="5.16">this is ridiculous why did you redact it</text>
  <text start="183.91" dur="5.07">why are you only giving us a portion</text>
  <text start="185.86" dur="5.64">this makes no sense so the FBI had to</text>
  <text start="188.98" dur="5.49">come out and they explain why this was</text>
  <text start="191.5" dur="4.47">happening because letting the public</text>
  <text start="194.47" dur="3.45">here or even read the gunman&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.97" dur="5.73">justification for the attack in his own</text>
  <text start="197.92" dur="6.93">words wrist encouraging others following</text>
  <text start="201.7" dur="5.039">him really that&amp;#39;s the excuse they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="204.85" dur="4.29">using because you know with all other</text>
  <text start="206.739" dur="5.581">crimes they come out with the 91 right</text>
  <text start="209.14" dur="4.95">911 recordings they play it they let you</text>
  <text start="212.32" dur="4.41">hear the dispatch they let you hear the</text>
  <text start="214.09" dur="4.2">people so the people are up in arms and</text>
  <text start="216.73" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re saying that&amp;#39;s ridiculous we want</text>
  <text start="218.29" dur="5.19">the full transcripts so the FBI they</text>
  <text start="221.5" dur="5.85">decided okay you know what here is the</text>
  <text start="223.48" dur="6.539">full transcripts we&amp;#39;ve taken and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="227.35" dur="4.949">put back all the information where we</text>
  <text start="230.019" dur="8.25">removed it where they removed the name</text>
  <text start="232.299" dur="7.801">you know back Hattie anywhere where it</text>
  <text start="238.269" dur="7.651">said the Islamic state they put that</text>
  <text start="240.1" dur="10.609">back and all of this was done to</text>
  <text start="245.92" dur="8.49">distract people from their real agenda</text>
  <text start="250.709" dur="7.661">their real agenda was they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="254.41" dur="6.569">release the recordings so they played</text>
  <text start="258.37" dur="4.89">this up where they gave us a portion of</text>
  <text start="260.979" dur="5.581">the transcript which is easy to</text>
  <text start="263.26" dur="5.73">manipulate and then had people scream</text>
  <text start="266.56" dur="4.68">out okay we can&amp;#39;t give you the rest of</text>
  <text start="268.99" dur="4.53">it it was redacted they had the people</text>
  <text start="271.24" dur="4.38">screaming yell and they said okay</text>
  <text start="273.52" dur="3.99">finally here it is are you satisfied now</text>
  <text start="275.62" dur="4.59">and everyone said yes we are satisfied</text>
  <text start="277.51" dur="5.79">now and everyone forgot about the</text>
  <text start="280.21" dur="7.56">recordings well let&amp;#39;s get the recordings</text>
  <text start="283.3" dur="9.32">let&amp;#39;s analyze these recordings and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="287.77" dur="8.43">see who really cold if there was a call</text>
  <text start="292.62" dur="5.65">but we can see they&amp;#39;re fully jet their</text>
  <text start="296.2" dur="5.07">agenda here their full agenda</text>
  <text start="298.27" dur="6.45">is to get everyone sidetracked and not</text>
  <text start="301.27" dur="6.57">ask for the real recordings now after</text>
  <text start="304.72" dur="5.7">the Orlando event the Supreme Court was</text>
  <text start="307.84" dur="4.83">looking at two states New York and</text>
  <text start="310.42" dur="5.34">Connecticut about the assault weapons</text>
  <text start="312.67" dur="5.82">ban now the Supreme Court rejects</text>
  <text start="315.76" dur="6.09">challenge to the state assault weapons</text>
  <text start="318.49" dur="5.97">ban they refused to question the assault</text>
  <text start="321.85" dur="4.68">rifle ban to New York and Connecticut so</text>
  <text start="324.46" dur="4.14">the justices left intact the federal</text>
  <text start="326.53" dur="4.74">appeals court ruling that said the ban</text>
  <text start="328.6" dur="5.22">complies with the constitutional right</text>
  <text start="331.27" dur="5.4">to bear arms well the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="333.82" dur="6.98">says the people have the right to bear</text>
  <text start="336.67" dur="7.92">arms and it shall not be infringed upon</text>
  <text start="340.8" dur="6.76">there&amp;#39;s no law above the rights of the</text>
  <text start="344.59" dur="5.97">people the Supreme Court actually</text>
  <text start="347.56" dur="7.29">doesn&amp;#39;t have the right to tell us We the</text>
  <text start="350.56" dur="7.47">People what should be our right and what</text>
  <text start="354.85" dur="4.86">should not be our rights we the people</text>
  <text start="358.03" dur="6.36">have the right to determine that</text>
  <text start="359.71" dur="6.93">ourselves and when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="364.39" dur="9.42">all have the right to have any weapon we</text>
  <text start="366.64" dur="10.56">would like so all of this is completely</text>
  <text start="373.81" dur="7.2">in violation of the Constitution and our</text>
  <text start="377.2" dur="6.51">rights and according to mulberry verse</text>
  <text start="381.01" dur="5.48">Madison any law that it&amp;#39;s repugnant to</text>
  <text start="383.71" dur="8.97">the Constitution the Bill of Rights is</text>
  <text start="386.49" dur="9.16">in violation and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="392.68" dur="4.92">point that the United States government</text>
  <text start="395.65" dur="4.68">the central bankers the black male</text>
  <text start="397.6" dur="4.74">Supreme Court leaders and the rest of</text>
  <text start="400.33" dur="6.72">the government employees who have been</text>
  <text start="402.34" dur="6.9">blackmailed they&amp;#39;re not fighting for the</text>
  <text start="407.05" dur="5.19">rights of the people they&amp;#39;re actually on</text>
  <text start="409.24" dur="5.82">the opposite end and we can see their</text>
  <text start="412.24" dur="5.52">main agenda right now is to remove the</text>
  <text start="415.06" dur="4.83">rights of the people it&amp;#39;s to remove the</text>
  <text start="417.76" dur="6.09">weapons from the people this is why</text>
  <text start="419.89" dur="7.02">Obama is pushing very hard to get those</text>
  <text start="423.85" dur="5.97">people on the no-fly list because this</text>
  <text start="426.91" dur="5.04">bypasses everything forget about limited</text>
  <text start="429.82" dur="5.19">limiting the bullets and magazine</text>
  <text start="431.95" dur="5.31">forget about stopping manufacturers all</text>
  <text start="435.01" dur="4.68">they would have to do is put a person on</text>
  <text start="437.26" dur="4.89">the list and say you can&amp;#39;t have a weapon</text>
  <text start="439.69" dur="4.95">of course this is in violation of the</text>
  <text start="442.15" dur="4.23">Second Amendment because there was no</text>
  <text start="444.64" dur="3.36">due process you don&amp;#39;t know how to get</text>
  <text start="446.38" dur="4.35">off of it you don&amp;#39;t know why you&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="448" dur="6.3">it and we can see they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="450.73" dur="7.26">anymore now according to US news world</text>
  <text start="454.3" dur="7.43">report researcher gary kleck he found</text>
  <text start="457.99" dur="6.6">that ninety-two percent of criminal tax</text>
  <text start="461.73" dur="5.89">they&amp;#39;re deterred when a gun is merely</text>
  <text start="464.59" dur="6.53">shown if we go back to nineteen</text>
  <text start="467.62" dur="7.68">eighty-two the Atlanta suburb Kennesaw</text>
  <text start="471.12" dur="7.75">or keen saw required all households to</text>
  <text start="475.3" dur="5.7">have a gun the residential burglary rate</text>
  <text start="478.87" dur="7.8">subsequently dropped by eighty-nine</text>
  <text start="481" dur="11.88">percent and we see ten years later with</text>
  <text start="486.67" dur="9.66">this same law in place the burglary rate</text>
  <text start="492.88" dur="5.76">in the same town was still seventy two</text>
  <text start="496.33" dur="5.91">percent lower than when the ordinance</text>
  <text start="498.64" dur="7.68">was passed according to another report</text>
  <text start="502.24" dur="7.68">it is important to note that those</text>
  <text start="506.32" dur="6.93">states that allow open carry that</text>
  <text start="509.92" dur="5.97">violent crime in those states they were</text>
  <text start="513.25" dur="4.65">twenty-three percent lower the murder</text>
  <text start="515.89" dur="6.96">rate in those states were five percent</text>
  <text start="517.9" dur="8.49">lower the robbery rates were thirty six</text>
  <text start="522.85" dur="5.79">percent lower so this tells us something</text>
  <text start="526.39" dur="4.74">actually if you look at what is</text>
  <text start="528.64" dur="5.97">happening and we have all these mass</text>
  <text start="531.13" dur="7.14">shootings isn&amp;#39;t it strange that they all</text>
  <text start="534.61" dur="6.78">happen in a gun-free zone area where</text>
  <text start="538.27" dur="5.34">nobody can defend themselves why does it</text>
  <text start="541.39" dur="4.85">happen in every single one of those</text>
  <text start="543.61" dur="6.39">areas look at Chicago for instance a</text>
  <text start="546.24" dur="6.1">complete gun-free zone area has the</text>
  <text start="550" dur="8.01">highest murder rate the highest crime</text>
  <text start="552.34" dur="9.21">rate unbelievable now we see the Supreme</text>
  <text start="558.01" dur="6.39">Court is out there once again and they</text>
  <text start="561.55" dur="5.91">are saying that the police have</text>
  <text start="564.4" dur="6.81">been given a free press to violate the</text>
  <text start="567.46" dur="8.27">rights of individuals just as long as</text>
  <text start="571.21" dur="7.26">they find evidence of a crime so if</text>
  <text start="575.73" dur="6.79">they&amp;#39;re searching through your car or</text>
  <text start="578.47" dur="6.72">your house or any other place using the</text>
  <text start="582.52" dur="7.08">search or seizure which violates the</text>
  <text start="585.19" dur="8.91">Fourth Amendment they can say ah we</text>
  <text start="589.6" dur="7.17">found evidence even though it was</text>
  <text start="594.1" dur="5.42">completely illegal and it violated your</text>
  <text start="596.77" dur="4.86">Fourth Amendment in Washington DC and</text>
  <text start="599.52" dur="4.87">another devastating blow to the Fourth</text>
  <text start="601.63" dur="4.77">Amendment the supreme court ruled that</text>
  <text start="604.39" dur="4.61">evidence of an alleged crime can be used</text>
  <text start="606.4" dur="5.4">against a defendant even if the police</text>
  <text start="609" dur="6.43">did something inappropriate or even</text>
  <text start="611.8" dur="7.86">illegal to obtain it this is</text>
  <text start="615.43" dur="8.94">unbelievable we&amp;#39;re seeing right now now</text>
  <text start="619.66" dur="7.14">in u.s. verse Shelton Barnes a case that</text>
  <text start="624.37" dur="7.35">seemed to slip by everyone completely</text>
  <text start="626.8" dur="10.23">unnoticed what they did here is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="631.72" dur="8.31">saying that the police they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="637.03" dur="5.88">to know the laws they don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="640.03" dur="9">understand the laws or even abide by the</text>
  <text start="642.91" dur="10.02">law to enforce the law we&amp;#39;re it actually</text>
  <text start="649.03" dur="8.87">what universe is this acceptable I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="652.93" dur="7.38">even believe this is a court ruling</text>
  <text start="657.9" dur="5.17">because if they don&amp;#39;t understand the law</text>
  <text start="660.31" dur="6.84">they don&amp;#39;t know the law how possibly can</text>
  <text start="663.07" dur="7.02">they enforce it actually when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="667.15" dur="7.2">arresting or doing anything to anyone</text>
  <text start="670.09" dur="7.26">they should recite the law to you what</text>
  <text start="674.35" dur="6.27">section it is and why they have the</text>
  <text start="677.35" dur="6.93">permission to do this now out in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="680.62" dur="5.46">we see poroshenko and Rasmussen they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="684.28" dur="4.5">discussing priorities for promoting</text>
  <text start="686.08" dur="6.12">Ukraine&amp;#39;s interests in the world how to</text>
  <text start="688.78" dur="6.81">battle Russian aggression and we see</text>
  <text start="692.2" dur="5.01">right now that poroshenko he wants to</text>
  <text start="695.59" dur="2.669">test the National Guard troops which</text>
  <text start="697.21" dur="3.359">were trained by the United</text>
  <text start="698.259" dur="4.98">government central bankers in the</text>
  <text start="700.569" dur="5.58">eastern area of Ukraine in the conflict</text>
  <text start="703.239" dur="6.78">zone he wants to see if they have the</text>
  <text start="706.149" dur="6.75">ability to control that area and we can</text>
  <text start="710.019" dur="5.49">see right now that this is going to</text>
  <text start="712.899" dur="7.5">cause a problem and the US government</text>
  <text start="715.509" dur="8.04">central bankers the elite they want this</text>
  <text start="720.399" dur="6.12">problem they&amp;#39;re trying to push their</text>
  <text start="723.549" dur="6">agenda and their agenda is to get the</text>
  <text start="726.519" dur="5.07">whole of Ukraine and they know they need</text>
  <text start="729.549" dur="3.9">some type of an event to make this</text>
  <text start="731.589" dur="4.86">happen and this is why we saw that</text>
  <text start="733.449" dur="5.78">advisory the warning go back up which</text>
  <text start="736.449" dur="6.18">supersedes all other warnings that us</text>
  <text start="739.229" dur="7.15">individuals US citizens do not go to</text>
  <text start="742.629" dur="7.02">Donetsk Lugansk or chromia don&amp;#39;t go to</text>
  <text start="746.379" dur="6.99">any of these areas at this point we see</text>
  <text start="749.649" dur="5.34">that 65 million people have been</text>
  <text start="753.369" dur="6.83">displaced worldwide because of</text>
  <text start="754.989" dur="11.28">Afghanistan Syria Libya Lebanon Iraq and</text>
  <text start="760.199" dur="9.19">by the way this raises the bar which</text>
  <text start="766.269" dur="7.23">just set a new world record because back</text>
  <text start="769.389" dur="9.06">in World War two there were 60 million</text>
  <text start="773.499" dur="9.3">people displaced and right now we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="778.449" dur="8.1">65 million so we really can consider</text>
  <text start="782.799" dur="6.21">this a world war at this point because</text>
  <text start="786.549" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;re at the same situation we&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="789.009" dur="6.721">fighting in many different countries all</text>
  <text start="791.949" dur="7.651">at the same time and this is all caused</text>
  <text start="795.73" dur="7.169">by the United States now the elected</text>
  <text start="799.6" dur="5.609">government in Libya they are on high</text>

  <text start="1127.95" dur="4.65">seen in the past they have many</text>
  <text start="1129.9" dur="5.16">different tricks up their sleeves if we</text>
  <text start="1132.6" dur="4.74">go back to 2013 when we had the sarin</text>
  <text start="1135.06" dur="4.83">gas attack that was one way they tried</text>
  <text start="1137.34" dur="4.65">to get into Syria then they had the</text>
  <text start="1139.89" dur="4.05">Islamic state appear out of nowhere but</text>
  <text start="1141.99" dur="4.17">we knew something was being done because</text>

  <text start="1162.21" dur="5.82">now is throughout Syria throughout Iraq</text>
  <text start="1165.84" dur="4.38">we need to go in there and start bombing</text>
  <text start="1168.03" dur="4.62">them because this is an uncontrolled</text>
  <text start="1170.22" dur="6.26">terrorist group here we&amp;#39;re at the point</text>
  <text start="1172.65" dur="7.28">where Russia and Syria are continually</text>
  <text start="1176.48" dur="7.06">pushing the Islamic state out of Syria</text>
