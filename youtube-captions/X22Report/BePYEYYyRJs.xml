  <text start="123.659" dur="4.261">we&amp;#39;re going to head out to Italy at this</text>
  <text start="125.369" dur="4.89">time and what we&amp;#39;re seeing as Italy was</text>
  <text start="127.92" dur="5.16">doing the same thing as the u.s. they</text>
  <text start="130.259" dur="5.281">were going to other countries looking</text>
  <text start="133.08" dur="5.37">for tax money they&amp;#39;re looking for</text>
  <text start="135.54" dur="4.23">revenue because as we know all of these</text>
  <text start="138.45" dur="4.62">countries</text>
  <text start="139.77" dur="5.72">have debt that cannot be sustained it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.07" dur="5.7">just impossible and as they continually</text>
  <text start="145.49" dur="6.4">push down on the people and they keep</text>
  <text start="148.77" dur="7.2">pushing austerity on the people people</text>
  <text start="151.89" dur="7.11">are not working people are hungry people</text>
  <text start="155.97" dur="5.01">can&amp;#39;t survive and they are not bringing</text>
  <text start="159" dur="4.47">in revenue to the government and the</text>
  <text start="160.98" dur="5.76">government&amp;#39;s continually bring in more</text>
  <text start="163.47" dur="4.98">debt so right now the Italian lawmakers</text>
  <text start="166.74" dur="4.71">had put the brakes on a plan to</text>
  <text start="168.45" dur="5.91">fast-track a partial amnesty for tax</text>
  <text start="171.45" dur="5.19">dodgers with assets stashed abroad after</text>
  <text start="174.36" dur="4.35">they expressed concern the cost and</text>
  <text start="176.64" dur="4.8">bureaucracy could discourage people from</text>
  <text start="178.71" dur="5.3">owning up a governmental official Senate</text>
  <text start="181.44" dur="6.39">on Tuesday the idea behind the amnesty</text>
  <text start="184.01" dur="6.04">was to favor a return of assets to Italy</text>
  <text start="187.83" dur="4.62">ahead of an agreement with Switzerland</text>
  <text start="190.05" dur="4.77">which is still being negotiated for to</text>
  <text start="192.45" dur="7.2">open up its bank database to Italian tax</text>
  <text start="194.82" dur="8.07">authorities lawmakers estimate that as</text>
  <text start="199.65" dur="5.49">much as 250 billion euros in Italy</text>
  <text start="202.89" dur="3.27">assets reside outside the country and</text>
  <text start="205.14" dur="3.63">the United States is doing the same</text>
  <text start="206.16" dur="5.07">thing they have the fact the law they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="208.77" dur="6">going across the globe they are trying</text>
  <text start="211.23" dur="5.94">to find those people who have a u.s.</text>
  <text start="214.77" dur="5.07">passport but might work in another</text>
  <text start="217.17" dur="5.73">country and they&amp;#39;re going to find those</text>
  <text start="219.84" dur="5.79">people and get their money because they</text>
  <text start="222.9" dur="5.49">need more revenue to come into the</text>
  <text start="225.63" dur="5.52">government to pay for this incredible</text>
  <text start="228.39" dur="5.4">amount of debt the incredible amount of</text>
  <text start="231.15" dur="5.52">social programs and all the aid that</text>
  <text start="233.79" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re sending to other countries and it</text>
  <text start="236.67" dur="5.7">cannot be sustained on the revenue</text>
  <text start="239.01" dur="5.699">within the United States because as we</text>
  <text start="242.37" dur="4.05">all know most of the people are out of</text>
  <text start="244.709" dur="3.931">work and we know that because of</text>
  <text start="246.42" dur="4.26">unemployment is so high not the fake</text>
  <text start="248.64" dur="4.17">numbers they&amp;#39;re giving us of six point</text>
  <text start="250.68" dur="5.39">six percent or six point seven percent</text>
  <text start="252.81" dur="6.75">went up a little bit it is completely</text>
  <text start="256.07" dur="6.61">the ability what they need to do is they</text>
  <text start="259.56" dur="5.67">need to find the money and they thought</text>
  <text start="262.68" dur="5.79">they had this with Obamacare and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="265.23" dur="4.74">saying that Obamacare is not doing what</text>
  <text start="268.47" dur="3.03">it&amp;#39;s supposed to do and this is why</text>
  <text start="269.97" dur="4.05">you&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of climate change</text>
  <text start="271.5" dur="4.259">news this is why all the</text>
  <text start="274.02" dur="3.75">government officials out there are</text>
  <text start="275.759" dur="4.261">talking about climate change because</text>
  <text start="277.77" dur="5.07">what they want to do is they want to put</text>
  <text start="280.02" dur="6.179">taxes on everything how much energy you</text>
  <text start="282.84" dur="6.09">use uh when you fill up at the gas tank</text>
  <text start="286.199" dur="5.071">this is why there are smart meters on</text>
  <text start="288.93" dur="4.739">your homes they completely monitor</text>
  <text start="291.27" dur="4.769">everything that you do and those people</text>
  <text start="293.669" dur="5.521">who use more energy will be taxed more</text>
  <text start="296.039" dur="6.301">and this is exactly what this is all</text>
  <text start="299.19" dur="7.219">about it&amp;#39;s all about bringing in more</text>
  <text start="302.34" dur="7.889">money to sustain their debt that they</text>
  <text start="306.409" dur="6.341">created and also to sustain the central</text>
  <text start="310.229" dur="4.59">bankers control around the world and</text>
  <text start="312.75" dur="5.49">this is why we are seeing this all</text>
  <text start="314.819" dur="6.061">happen at this time now here in the</text>
  <text start="318.24" dur="5.579">United States wholesale sales collapse</text>
  <text start="320.88" dur="4.17">most in five years now again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="323.819" dur="2.761">going to blame everything on the weather</text>
  <text start="325.05" dur="3.78">like they always do it&amp;#39;s always the</text>
  <text start="326.58" dur="5.579">weather that&amp;#39;s the problem again the</text>
  <text start="328.83" dur="5.519">entire country does not receive snow all</text>
  <text start="332.159" dur="4.111">at the same time yes there are certain</text>
  <text start="334.349" dur="3.451">parts that are warmer and colder but</text>
  <text start="336.27" dur="4.019">they&amp;#39;re making it seem like the entire</text>
  <text start="337.8" dur="4.109">country was wiped out because of all</text>
  <text start="340.289" dur="3.81">these snowstorms and nobody can do</text>
  <text start="341.909" dur="3.901">anything well the South was fine the</text>
  <text start="344.099" dur="4.711">Midwest was fine at times when the</text>
  <text start="345.81" dur="5.25">Northeast wasn&amp;#39;t so realistically this</text>
  <text start="348.81" dur="4.44">weather thing is not really fitting into</text>
  <text start="351.06" dur="4.71">the economic model here they just use it</text>
  <text start="353.25" dur="3.9">as an excuse and people go oh yeah the</text>
  <text start="355.77" dur="3.42">weather that&amp;#39;s right I heard about a</text>
  <text start="357.15" dur="3.84">storm and this is what they do but a</text>
  <text start="359.19" dur="7.5">wholesale sales drop by one point nine</text>
  <text start="360.99" dur="9.06">percent and this is the worst since 1993</text>
  <text start="366.69" dur="6.44">inventories sales ratio surged to its</text>
  <text start="370.05" dur="6.959">highest in 11 months and again remember</text>
  <text start="373.13" dur="6.509">back in December and in January when the</text>
  <text start="377.009" dur="5.671">automobile industry they were channel</text>
  <text start="379.639" dur="5.801">stuffing the dealerships they had a</text>
  <text start="382.68" dur="5.849">hundred and fourteen days worth of autos</text>
  <text start="385.44" dur="6.539">on the dealership lot and they were they</text>
  <text start="388.529" dur="5.911">were using discounts and anything they</text>
  <text start="391.979" dur="4.201">possibly could do to get rid of these</text>
  <text start="394.44" dur="5.37">cars because there was so much inventory</text>
  <text start="396.18" dur="5.94">on the the on the dealers lots and they</text>
  <text start="399.81" dur="7.229">were even giving loans away to subprime</text>
  <text start="402.12" dur="5.8">borrowers and again the this whole</text>
  <text start="407.039" dur="4.121">purpose</text>
  <text start="407.92" dur="5.49">this is to show that met to manipulate</text>
  <text start="411.16" dur="4.71">the numbers manufacturing is up but then</text>
  <text start="413.41" dur="5.01">now here we have a problem with all this</text>
  <text start="415.87" dur="6.09">inventory on the lot and again you</text>
  <text start="418.42" dur="6.09">cannot manipulate everything because it</text>
  <text start="421.96" dur="6.03">turns up in other places and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="424.51" dur="5.61">seeing this happen right now again we</text>
  <text start="427.99" dur="4.25">see this happening all over and in the</text>
  <text start="430.12" dur="5.28">economy we see it in the retail sector</text>
  <text start="432.24" dur="5.08">we see that people do not have work and</text>
  <text start="435.4" dur="3.78">they don&amp;#39;t have the disposable income</text>
  <text start="437.32" dur="3.45">and since they do not have the</text>
  <text start="439.18" dur="3.24">disposable income they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="440.77" dur="3.09">go out shopping that&amp;#39;s pretty much it</text>
  <text start="442.42" dur="3.84">and if they&amp;#39;re not going to go out</text>
  <text start="443.86" dur="5.19">shopping stores are not going to make it</text>
  <text start="446.26" dur="5.28">and this is why we see stores closing</text>
  <text start="449.05" dur="4.92">this is why we see staples closing JC</text>
  <text start="451.54" dur="5.28">Penney Macy&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="453.97" dur="5.79">stores close and now clothing retailer</text>
  <text start="456.82" dur="7.92">actually stored plans to close 27 stores</text>
  <text start="459.76" dur="9.33">and again we as we go throughout this</text>
  <text start="464.74" dur="7.35">year we are going to see many more store</text>
  <text start="469.09" dur="5.58">closings it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s inevitable</text>
  <text start="472.09" dur="5.97">because what we are seeing is that the</text>
  <text start="474.67" dur="6.36">jobs are not out there now in a good</text>
  <text start="478.06" dur="4.92">economy the youth would finish college</text>
  <text start="481.03" dur="3.96">where they get out of high school they</text>
  <text start="482.98" dur="4.35">go find work they find work out of</text>
  <text start="484.99" dur="4.17">college and they would start their lives</text>
  <text start="487.33" dur="3.9">they would start bringing in income they</text>
  <text start="489.16" dur="3.15">would have disposable income even if</text>
  <text start="491.23" dur="2.58">they were living with their parents</text>
  <text start="492.31" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;d be able to pay their student</text>
  <text start="493.81" dur="4.62">loans they would have a little bit extra</text>
  <text start="495.58" dur="7.38">money they would go out and buy a TV for</text>
  <text start="498.43" dur="7.92">their room or a game center or clothing</text>
  <text start="502.96" dur="5.76">or a car and we are not seeing this at</text>
  <text start="506.35" dur="7.05">this time and the youth are not</text>
  <text start="508.72" dur="7.17">supporting the future economy of the</text>
  <text start="513.4" dur="4.17">United States and actually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="515.89" dur="5.28">happening is we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="517.57" dur="6.659">layoffs and just from january to the end</text>
  <text start="521.17" dur="6.42">of februari we have seen tens of</text>
  <text start="524.229" dur="6.721">thousands of people slated to be laid</text>
  <text start="527.59" dur="5.31">off in major corporations again where</text>
  <text start="530.95" dur="3.36">are all these people going to go most of</text>
  <text start="532.9" dur="3.36">these people are making very good</text>
  <text start="534.31" dur="5.25">incomes and now they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="536.26" dur="5.19">go look and find jobs in their field and</text>
  <text start="539.56" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s going to be very difficult to find</text>
  <text start="541.45" dur="6.33">this type of work and I know many many</text>
  <text start="544.06" dur="6.18">people here in where I am now in New</text>
  <text start="547.78" dur="5.19">York and in many different areas they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="550.24" dur="6.36">trying to find work again they got laid</text>
  <text start="552.97" dur="5.79">off and they were making a certain</text>
  <text start="556.6" dur="4.05">amount of money they&amp;#39;ve been applying to</text>
  <text start="558.76" dur="4.62">different places and the salaries are</text>
  <text start="560.65" dur="4.53">much lower and other people they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="563.38" dur="3.87">even get a response when they send their</text>
  <text start="565.18" dur="3.54">resumes out but we can see other</text>
  <text start="567.25" dur="4.92">companies that are laying often house</text>
  <text start="568.72" dur="5.67">Erick Insurance Group 800 globally sesa</text>
  <text start="572.17" dur="5.28">sterlite up to a thousand</text>
  <text start="574.39" dur="7.11">internationally so more and more people</text>
  <text start="577.45" dur="6.9">are losing work and we see thousands</text>
  <text start="581.5" dur="4.05">upon thousands of layoffs coming up and</text>
  <text start="584.35" dur="4.01">we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot more in the</text>
  <text start="585.55" dur="6.33">financial industry coming up very soon</text>
  <text start="588.36" dur="9.96">now the latest jolt numbers are out and</text>
  <text start="591.88" dur="9.57">they expected 4.0 15 and they received</text>
  <text start="598.32" dur="5.71">3.97 and it was completely disappointing</text>
  <text start="601.45" dur="6.8">and they expected to be a lot higher and</text>
  <text start="604.03" dur="8.64">this is not helping the employment</text>
  <text start="608.25" dur="7.69">sector and again the labor force of</text>
  <text start="612.67" dur="8.22">youths these are people these are young</text>
  <text start="615.94" dur="8.16">adults aging ranging from 20 to 29 what</text>
  <text start="620.89" dur="7.11">we are seeing right now is that their</text>
  <text start="624.1" dur="7.65">participation rate has dropped they</text>
  <text start="628" dur="10.2">haven&amp;#39;t seen this the participation rate</text>
  <text start="631.75" dur="8.61">so low since 1981 so right now the</text>
  <text start="638.2" dur="3.9">bureau of labor statistics started</text>
  <text start="640.36" dur="4.62">releasing employment data on people in</text>
  <text start="642.1" dur="6.69">the full age bracket of 20 through 29</text>
  <text start="644.98" dur="7.47">and there&amp;#39;s about 10.5 million americans</text>
  <text start="648.79" dur="7.8">aged 20 to 29 who are not in the labor</text>
  <text start="652.45" dur="9.06">force in 2013 this is the highest ever</text>
  <text start="656.59" dur="7.86">recorded by the BLS again this is the</text>
  <text start="661.51" dur="6.66">future of the United States if they</text>
  <text start="664.45" dur="7.08">cannot find work we have a major problem</text>
  <text start="668.17" dur="6.599">and guess what the government knows this</text>
  <text start="671.53" dur="6.809">this is why they created the</text>
  <text start="674.769" dur="6.12">HS this is why they installed the NDAA</text>
  <text start="678.339" dur="6.75">this is why they have the Patriot Act</text>
  <text start="680.889" dur="7.831">this is why NSA has been spying on every</text>
  <text start="685.089" dur="5.761">single person because they need to put</text>
  <text start="688.72" dur="5.13">everyone in a group they got to make</text>
  <text start="690.85" dur="5.639">sure who is a threat to their power and</text>
  <text start="693.85" dur="5.909">this is why they&amp;#39;ve been creating lists</text>
  <text start="696.489" dur="6.33">and this is why the DHS wants to create</text>
  <text start="699.759" dur="4.83">this real ID system to keep track of</text>
  <text start="702.819" dur="5.041">every single person if you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="704.589" dur="5.821">what the real real ID system is this is</text>
  <text start="707.86" dur="5.579">where every single state has to be in</text>
  <text start="710.41" dur="4.589">compliance with DHS and they will send</text>
  <text start="713.439" dur="5.101">your license information which will</text>
  <text start="714.999" dur="5.911">include DNA iris scan fingerprint your</text>
  <text start="718.54" dur="4.62">license will be fitted with an RFID chip</text>
  <text start="720.91" dur="4.429">so they can track you all this</text>
  <text start="723.16" dur="5.909">information will be sent to a federal</text>
  <text start="725.339" dur="6.67">database this federal database will then</text>
  <text start="729.069" dur="4.651">be used by all the states by the federal</text>
  <text start="732.009" dur="4.98">government and your information will</text>
  <text start="733.72" dur="4.829">also be used in Canada and in Mexico so</text>
  <text start="736.989" dur="3.81">they can track you leaving the country</text>
  <text start="738.549" dur="4.26">and of course at all airports and and</text>
  <text start="740.799" dur="4.22">all these different checkpoints and</text>
  <text start="742.809" dur="7.041">again we have to remember they&amp;#39;ve set up</text>
  <text start="745.019" dur="7.51">according to DHS and the US government a</text>
  <text start="749.85" dur="4">hundred-mile constitutional free zone</text>
  <text start="752.529" dur="4.141">which really doesn&amp;#39;t exist because</text>
  <text start="753.85" dur="4.829">there&amp;#39;s no such thing but if know if a</text>
  <text start="756.67" dur="3.779">lot of people believe that exists it</text>
  <text start="758.679" dur="4.2">will they are going to set up</text>
  <text start="760.449" dur="6.24">checkpoints and they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="762.879" dur="6.51">this real ID system to make sure that</text>
  <text start="766.689" dur="4.32">you are you they are they&amp;#39;ll be able to</text>
  <text start="769.389" dur="3.331">track you because most people carry</text>
  <text start="771.009" dur="5.19">their licenses wherever they go and they</text>
  <text start="772.72" dur="5.669">will know exactly where you are now of</text>
  <text start="776.199" dur="4.711">course they understand that the economy</text>
  <text start="778.389" dur="3.63">is not going to make it they realize</text>
  <text start="780.91" dur="3.149">this and this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="782.019" dur="3.69">putting all these laws into place it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="784.059" dur="3.39">very odd to have these type of laws</text>
  <text start="785.709" dur="4.531">because why would you need them the only</text>
  <text start="787.449" dur="5.97">reason you would need them is to control</text>
  <text start="790.24" dur="6.509">the population and right now global</text>
  <text start="793.419" dur="6.42">growth forecasts what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="796.749" dur="6.5">the global growth forecast is going to</text>
  <text start="799.839" dur="6.66">remain sluggish and there was a</text>
  <text start="803.249" dur="6.041">international economic body that said</text>
  <text start="806.499" dur="6.121">which is a warning on Tuesday</text>
  <text start="809.29" dur="7.229">that the global economy around the world</text>
  <text start="812.62" dur="6.99">is going to be very sluggish it also</text>
  <text start="816.519" dur="6.661">warned that the dip in growth in the US</text>
  <text start="819.61" dur="6.719">over the winter could have longer</text>
  <text start="823.18" dur="6.12">lasting repercussions if the if the</text>
  <text start="826.329" dur="5.521">recent economic weakness were to durably</text>
  <text start="829.3" dur="4.89">depress confidence it could undermine</text>
  <text start="831.85" dur="5.94">the recovery so you&amp;#39;re trying to tell me</text>
  <text start="834.19" dur="5.79">the months of january-february when we</text>
  <text start="837.79" dur="6.539">had those couple of snowstorms it is</text>
  <text start="839.98" dur="8.43">come is going to completely derail the</text>
  <text start="844.329" dur="6.99">recovery when again yes we&amp;#39;ve had bad</text>
  <text start="848.41" dur="4.919">weather but it didn&amp;#39;t hit every single</text>
  <text start="851.319" dur="4.411">state and it was only for a day or two</text>
  <text start="853.329" dur="4.801">each time they weren&amp;#39;t wiped out for</text>
  <text start="855.73" dur="5.37">three weeks at a time so they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="858.13" dur="5.639">to make you believe that because of the</text>
  <text start="861.1" dur="5.76">weather the economy might not make it</text>
  <text start="863.769" dur="6.661">they&amp;#39;re trying to shift blame to other</text>
  <text start="866.86" dur="6.9">places and we see this and again they</text>
  <text start="870.43" dur="6.3">understand that the economy is not going</text>
  <text start="873.76" dur="5.579">to do well this is why there was a</text>
  <text start="876.73" dur="5.339">report out there about home Homeland</text>
  <text start="879.339" dur="4.471">Security pre-staging a domestic military</text>
  <text start="882.069" dur="5.191">force and most of us know this we</text>
  <text start="883.81" dur="6.06">already know that DHS has been working</text>
  <text start="887.26" dur="5.579">with local law enforcement they have</text>
  <text start="889.87" dur="6.06">been making giving them you know assault</text>
  <text start="892.839" dur="5.281">weapons uniforms they&amp;#39;ve been training</text>
  <text start="895.93" dur="3.839">them and again these local law</text>
  <text start="898.12" dur="5.13">enforcement&amp;#39;s have to be in compliance</text>
  <text start="899.769" dur="5.69">with DHS and DHS will have full control</text>
  <text start="903.25" dur="5.16">of all these local law enforcement</text>
  <text start="905.459" dur="4.661">departments but the US Army has</text>
  <text start="908.41" dur="5.369">announced that is giving thirteen</text>
  <text start="910.12" dur="5.43">thousand of these tanks to Department of</text>

  <text start="915.55" dur="4.76">spread out through the country to the</text>
  <text start="917.769" dur="7.201">local law enforcement now let me ask you</text>
  <text start="920.31" dur="9.459">why would a local law enforcement in a</text>
  <text start="924.97" dur="8.7">small town need a 20-ton tank a Mine</text>
  <text start="929.769" dur="6.69">Resistant ambush-protected truck these</text>
  <text start="933.67" dur="6.029">were built to specifically to save US</text>
  <text start="936.459" dur="6.99">soldiers from roadside bombs in the Iraq</text>
  <text start="939.699" dur="6.72">and Afghanistan wars what type of crim</text>
  <text start="943.449" dur="5.281">are out there that are using this type</text>
  <text start="946.419" dur="6.39">of technology that we need tanks in</text>
  <text start="948.73" dur="7.349">small towns it makes no sense what so</text>
  <text start="952.809" dur="7.2">ever the reason why they need it for</text>
  <text start="956.079" dur="6.901">mass riots for people who are angry for</text>
  <text start="960.009" dur="6.66">people who want this government gone</text>
  <text start="962.98" dur="7.229">this is why all of this is being input</text>
  <text start="966.669" dur="5.46">and put into place and we have to</text>
  <text start="970.209" dur="4.5">remember over the many years and again</text>
  <text start="972.129" dur="4.531">the government and all these agencies</text>
  <text start="974.709" dur="4.021">they do everything in an incremental</text>
  <text start="976.66" dur="3.959">phase they don&amp;#39;t do everything at once</text>
  <text start="978.73" dur="5.579">and what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing over the</text>
  <text start="980.619" dur="6.63">years is that we&amp;#39;ve been desensitized we</text>
  <text start="984.309" dur="5.25">were getting people they got people used</text>
  <text start="987.249" dur="4.65">to seeing military hardware on local</text>
  <text start="989.559" dur="5.49">roadways which we we have seen we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="991.899" dur="5.52">seen DHS procuring a nearly about two</text>
  <text start="995.049" dur="4.2">billion rounds of ammo checkpoints to</text>
  <text start="997.419" dur="3.6">travel within our country have been set</text>
  <text start="999.249" dur="3.75">up and again they&amp;#39;re going to use these</text>
  <text start="1001.019" dur="5.28">real IDs just getting us used to all of</text>
  <text start="1002.999" dur="5.88">this we&amp;#39;ve seen paramilitary civilian</text>
  <text start="1006.299" dur="5.88">police forces we&amp;#39;ve seen mass</text>
  <text start="1008.879" dur="6.42">surveillance of all citizens we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="1012.179" dur="6.27">political elite above the law and the</text>
  <text start="1015.299" dur="5.88">imitate the intimidation of the press</text>
  <text start="1018.449" dur="6.811">they have been doing this slowly all</text>
  <text start="1021.179" dur="7.291">along to get us used to what is coming</text>
  <text start="1025.26" dur="5.909">but then again as we all know what is</text>
  <text start="1028.47" dur="4.619">coming is always going to be a lot worse</text>
  <text start="1031.169" dur="4.951">than what we think and we have to</text>
  <text start="1033.089" dur="5.58">remember what Barack Obama said and this</text>
  <text start="1036.12" dur="5.789">is a quote from him we cannot continue</text>
  <text start="1038.669" dur="5.67">to rely on only on our military in order</text>
  <text start="1041.909" dur="5.851">to achieve the national security</text>
  <text start="1044.339" dur="6.69">objectives that we&amp;#39;ve set we&amp;#39;ve got to</text>
  <text start="1047.76" dur="6.659">have a civilian national security force</text>
  <text start="1051.029" dur="8.221">that&amp;#39;s just as powerful just as strong</text>
  <text start="1054.419" dur="8.75">just as well funded why to control the</text>
  <text start="1059.25" dur="7.47">American people DHS is the</text>
  <text start="1063.169" dur="7.781">anti-terrorism force who are the</text>
  <text start="1066.72" dur="7.62">terrorists you the American people this</text>
  <text start="1070.95" dur="5.85">is why DHS has been created this is why</text>
  <text start="1074.34" dur="4.98">there are fusion centers this</text>
  <text start="1076.8" dur="4.31">is why they are trying to this is why</text>
  <text start="1079.32" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re setting up a complete</text>
  <text start="1081.11" dur="6.91">surveillance grid all across the country</text>
  <text start="1083.91" dur="6.57">to monitor and to track every single</text>
  <text start="1088.02" dur="5.01">person because they need to know where</text>
  <text start="1090.48" dur="5.66">everyone is and when everything come</text>
  <text start="1093.03" dur="5.34">starts to come starts to collapse and</text>
  <text start="1096.14" dur="5.05">people are running scared they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1098.37" dur="6.06">know what to do they have the FEMA camps</text>
  <text start="1101.19" dur="9.45">they have the lists and this is what it</text>
  <text start="1104.43" dur="9.48">is all about okay now we understand that</text>
  <text start="1110.64" dur="5.46">we&amp;#39;re having a huge crisis in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1113.91" dur="4.11">there&amp;#39;s a crisis in Libya there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1116.1" dur="5.34">crisis in Iraq does a crisis in Africa</text>
  <text start="1118.02" dur="5.7">is crisis everywhere around the globe</text>

  <text start="1123.72" dur="4.32">Council held a fifth meeting on the</text>
  <text start="1125.46" dur="5.58">situation in Ukraine over a period of 10</text>
  <text start="1128.04" dur="6.93">days and this reminds me of the Geneva 2</text>
  <text start="1131.04" dur="6.63">talks with President Assad and again the</text>
  <text start="1134.97" dur="5.04">US central bankers had one agenda that</text>
  <text start="1137.67" dur="5.1">was to replace Assad so guess what those</text>
  <text start="1140.01" dur="5.39">talks went nowhere well the UN Security</text>
  <text start="1142.77" dur="5.97">Council these talks went absolutely</text>
  <text start="1145.4" dur="6.85">nowhere there was absolutely no progress</text>
  <text start="1148.74" dur="5.91">in it whatsoever and Russia is out there</text>
  <text start="1152.25" dur="5.61">that they&amp;#39;re very word about weapons</text>
  <text start="1154.65" dur="6.12">ammunition all being stolen from the</text>
  <text start="1157.86" dur="5.07">military Depot&amp;#39;s and they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1160.77" dur="4.41">where any of this is and again yesterday</text>
  <text start="1162.93" dur="4.26">I mentioned that the the portable</text>
  <text start="1165.18" dur="4.23">surface-to-air missile systems are</text>
  <text start="1167.19" dur="4.41">missing and russia wants to know what</text>
  <text start="1169.41" dur="5.1">has happened to all of this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1171.6" dur="7.11">also very concerned about the US central</text>
  <text start="1174.51" dur="7.61">bankers EU looting the country removing</text>
  <text start="1178.71" dur="6.12">the gold and the US has not answered any</text>
  <text start="1182.12" dur="5.65">of the questions that well that would</text>
  <text start="1184.83" dur="4.74">put forth to them and they&amp;#39;re you know</text>
  <text start="1187.77" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re saying what is going on here</text>
  <text start="1189.57" dur="7.34">this gold is for the people where did it</text>
  <text start="1192.45" dur="8.94">go now we have to remember that during</text>
  <text start="1196.91" dur="6.94">the Syrian crisis and the Geneva 2 talks</text>
  <text start="1201.39" dur="5.76">the United States put a document out</text>
  <text start="1203.85" dur="6.419">there for humanitarian aid and they gave</text>
  <text start="1207.15" dur="4.619">it to the UN Security Council</text>
  <text start="1210.269" dur="3.301">the Russians read it over and they said</text>
  <text start="1211.769" dur="5.311">no we&amp;#39;re not going to go along with this</text>
  <text start="1213.57" dur="6.12">we will veto this draft because in this</text>
  <text start="1217.08" dur="4.649">document it says that Assad has</text>
  <text start="1219.69" dur="4.709">committed war crimes this is why they</text>
  <text start="1221.729" dur="5.73">need you humanitarian aid and it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1224.399" dur="6.09">prove anything it&amp;#39;s in there and people</text>
  <text start="1227.459" dur="5.07">are going to misinterpret this well the</text>
  <text start="1230.489" dur="4.92">United States gave a proposal to the</text>
  <text start="1232.529" dur="6.421">Russian government at this time and the</text>
  <text start="1235.409" dur="5.85">Russians have said the US proposal to</text>
  <text start="1238.95" dur="5.399">resolve the crisis in Ukraine are based</text>
  <text start="1241.259" dur="5.7">on an assumed conflict between Moscow</text>
  <text start="1244.349" dur="4.11">and Kiev and that is something with</text>
  <text start="1246.959" dur="3.81">which the Russian government cannot</text>
  <text start="1248.459" dur="4.88">agree upon the US Secretary of State</text>
  <text start="1250.769" dur="6.63">John Kerry last Friday handed the paper</text>
  <text start="1253.339" dur="6.31">to Lavrov and there is a concept in the</text>
  <text start="1257.399" dur="3.96">document that we are not quite happy</text>
  <text start="1259.649" dur="3.69">with because everything has been</text>
  <text start="1261.359" dur="4.53">formulated as though there is some kind</text>
  <text start="1263.339" dur="5.731">of conflict between Russia and Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1265.889" dur="5.58">as though we admit certain facts really</text>
  <text start="1269.07" dur="4.079">exists and again this is a little trick</text>
  <text start="1271.469" dur="4.92">that they play we&amp;#39;ve seen it in the</text>
  <text start="1273.149" dur="6.14">Geneva 2 we saw it in the UN Council</text>
  <text start="1276.389" dur="5.4">draft-free humanitarian aid and again</text>
  <text start="1279.289" dur="4.87">this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="1281.789" dur="6.18">because again we have to remember the</text>
  <text start="1284.159" dur="7.56">whole Ukraine Fiasco was a coup they</text>
  <text start="1287.969" dur="6.75">spent 5 billion dollars to overthrow the</text>
  <text start="1291.719" dur="5.64">government of Ukraine and to put in</text>
  <text start="1294.719" dur="4.5">their own puppet regime that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1297.359" dur="3.78">done in the Middle East but which</text>
  <text start="1299.219" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;ve done in Thailand because they</text>
  <text start="1301.139" dur="7.32">want Ukraine on the EU system and they</text>
  <text start="1304.139" dur="6.78">want Ukraine on NATO now the Ukrainian</text>

  <text start="1310.919" dur="4.83">remember let me just go back for a</text>
  <text start="1312.059" dur="6.18">second here if you recall the new</text>
  <text start="1315.749" dur="5.88">government in Ukraine was not elected</text>
  <text start="1318.239" dur="6.9">they did not hold elections at all now</text>
  <text start="1321.629" dur="6.33">why is that why wouldn&amp;#39;t they open it up</text>
  <text start="1325.139" dur="5.16">to the entire country because they were</text>

  <text start="1537.06" dur="4.68">country had only about 6,000</text>
  <text start="1538.91" dur="6.31">combat-ready infantry and they need more</text>
  <text start="1541.74" dur="5.58">people so the goal of this National</text>
  <text start="1545.22" dur="4.17">Guard would be to defend citizens from</text>
  <text start="1547.32" dur="4.86">criminals and from internal or external</text>
  <text start="1549.39" dur="6.6">aggression and this is what they are</text>
  <text start="1552.18" dur="7.68">looking to do at this time now as we</text>
  <text start="1555.99" dur="6.24">know with North Korea they are on their</text>
  <text start="1559.86" dur="4.71">their sanctions imposed upon them and</text>
  <text start="1562.23" dur="4.68">again all these countries that have</text>
  <text start="1564.57" dur="4.62">sanctions they figure it out a way to</text>
  <text start="1566.91" dur="5.07">get around them they border they use</text>
  <text start="1569.19" dur="4.98">gold they use other currencies and they</text>
  <text start="1571.98" dur="4.23">always seem to make it work and right</text>
  <text start="1574.17" dur="4.23">now a new UN report has found that North</text>
  <text start="1576.21" dur="4.62">Korea is managing to evade international</text>
  <text start="1578.4" dur="4.8">sanctions I know find this as a big</text>
  <text start="1580.83" dur="5.09">surprise because Iran has been doing it</text>
  <text start="1583.2" dur="6.12">for many years Cuba has been doing it</text>
  <text start="1585.92" dur="5.35">for many years and North Korea now they</text>
  <text start="1589.32" dur="3.53">just figured out wow you know they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1591.27" dur="4.65">been bartering they&amp;#39;ve been using other</text>
  <text start="1592.85" dur="5.11">currencies they&amp;#39;ve been using gold to</text>
  <text start="1595.92" dur="4.35">evade these sanctions well of course</text>
  <text start="1597.96" dur="4.59">they have because the country will do</text>
  <text start="1600.27" dur="3.21">what they have to do to survive just</text>
  <text start="1602.55" dur="3.06">like they have</text>
  <text start="1603.48" dur="5.69">the North Korean oil tanker in the</text>
  <text start="1605.61" dur="7.41">Libyan ports being filled up with oil</text>
  <text start="1609.17" dur="7.3">again these ships that are being filled</text>
  <text start="1613.02" dur="5.43">up by the Libyan rebels or militia which</text>
  <text start="1616.47" dur="5.61">are not part of Libyan government are</text>
  <text start="1618.45" dur="6.06">selling the oil not using the US dollar</text>
  <text start="1622.08" dur="3.96">and right now of course the Libyan</text>
  <text start="1624.51" dur="3.18">government does not like that because</text>
  <text start="1626.04" dur="4.17">they are the puppet government of the</text>
  <text start="1627.69" dur="5.37">central bankers US government and again</text>
  <text start="1630.21" dur="5.25">already from yesterday they were going</text>
  <text start="1633.06" dur="5.28">to impose start imposing sanctions and</text>
  <text start="1635.46" dur="4.26">penalties on the militia rebels but they</text>
  <text start="1638.34" dur="3.3">don&amp;#39;t really care because they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1639.72" dur="4.17">using US dollars and if they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1641.64" dur="5.82">gold for this oil they really don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="1643.89" dur="6.27">about it now there are reports that this</text>
  <text start="1647.46" dur="5.01">North Korean tanker has sailed off it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1650.16" dur="4.35">in international waters and the rebels</text>
  <text start="1652.47" dur="6.72">say that they have escorted the tanker</text>
  <text start="1654.51" dur="6.39">out of the port at 3am and during this</text>
  <text start="1659.19" dur="4.83">time it seems like the ship has been</text>
  <text start="1660.9" dur="5.67">getting you know away from the Libyan</text>
  <text start="1664.02" dur="4.5">government and right now there must have</text>
  <text start="1666.57" dur="4.68">been a call that came in from the US</text>
  <text start="1668.52" dur="5.07">government central bankers to the puppet</text>
  <text start="1671.25" dur="4.2">regime of the Libyan government and said</text>
  <text start="1673.59" dur="4.86">listen you need to do something to stop</text>
  <text start="1675.45" dur="5.84">this this cannot happen and all of a</text>
  <text start="1678.45" dur="7.14">sudden we see the Libyans Prime Minister</text>
  <text start="1681.29" dur="9.91">was ousted on Tuesday and the defense</text>
  <text start="1685.59" dur="7.98">minister abdullah al vahini was voted in</text>
  <text start="1691.2" dur="4.98">and now he is the new prime minister and</text>
  <text start="1693.57" dur="5.75">then all of a sudden there were reports</text>
  <text start="1696.18" dur="6.84">coming in that the Libya Navy fired upon</text>
  <text start="1699.32" dur="5.86">North Korean ship with a missile and hit</text>
  <text start="1703.02" dur="6.27">the ship and it is on fire now again</text>
  <text start="1705.18" dur="5.43">this is an attack on North Korea and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1709.29" dur="5.37">going to go back to what I&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="1710.61" dur="7.53">said the central bankers want war they</text>
  <text start="1714.66" dur="4.92">do not care how it starts because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1718.14" dur="5.04">going to have to see what the response</text>
  <text start="1719.58" dur="6.96">is from North Korea because you know</text>
  <text start="1723.18" dur="5.91">again if it was a u.s. ship and another</text>
  <text start="1726.54" dur="4.95">country fired a missile into one of our</text>
  <text start="1729.09" dur="4.26">tankers pretty much it&amp;#39;s an act of war</text>
  <text start="1731.49" dur="3.84">so we&amp;#39;re going to have to see the</text>
  <text start="1733.35" dur="4.02">response from North Korea at this time</text>
  <text start="1735.33" dur="5.82">and again these central bankers</text>
  <text start="1737.37" dur="6.6">their end goal is to start war to cover</text>
  <text start="1741.15" dur="7.98">up this entire collapse that is coming</text>
  <text start="1743.97" dur="8.31">and again we have to realize if they</text>
  <text start="1749.13" dur="5.31">decide to do something against Libya the</text>
  <text start="1752.28" dur="5.76">US government is going to come to their</text>
  <text start="1754.44" dur="7.08">aid and again we&amp;#39;re going to see other</text>

  <text start="1782.07" dur="7.07">can see all of this has been set up to</text>
  <text start="1785.15" dur="9.73">bring about war to cover up this entire</text>

  <text start="1815.22" dur="7.2">start selling this oil from all from all</text>
  <text start="1819.09" dur="5.58">the ports that we control and again I</text>
  <text start="1822.42" dur="6.2">said this in the past this is going to</text>
  <text start="1824.67" dur="8.009">pose a problem because they start if</text>
  <text start="1828.62" dur="6.7">more and more oil tankers come in to</text>
  <text start="1832.679" dur="5.701">purchase this oil and they are not using</text>
  <text start="1835.32" dur="5.58">the US dollar the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="1838.38" dur="6.45">not going to have this they will do</text>
  <text start="1840.9" dur="7.17">something to create an incident where</text>
  <text start="1844.83" dur="5.28">this war can start and they have already</text>
  <text start="1848.07" dur="4.02">done it with North Korea and if there</text>

  <text start="2231.29" dur="4.14">keeping someone at homeland security up</text>
  <text start="2233.33" dur="3.6">at night poole said the other big</text>
  <text start="2235.43" dur="5.45">question is how many more of these</text>
  <text start="2236.93" dur="7.62">incidents are going unreported again</text>
  <text start="2240.88" dur="7.06">they have built the propaganda up they</text>
  <text start="2244.55" dur="7.41">have had the drills the grid extra all</text>
  <text start="2247.94" dur="8.1">of this is done on purpose because they</text>
  <text start="2251.96" dur="7.08">have to understand exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2256.04" dur="4.92">going to do if you remember back before</text>
  <text start="2259.04" dur="5.4">the World Trade Center was hit there was</text>
  <text start="2260.96" dur="7.1">a bomb in the basement which was a test</text>
  <text start="2264.44" dur="6.9">of how everything is going to work in</text>
  <text start="2268.06" dur="7.12">2003 the power grid one</text>
  <text start="2271.34" dur="6.48">out along the east coast this was a test</text>
  <text start="2275.18" dur="5.16">it wasn&amp;#39;t a power line that went down</text>
  <text start="2277.82" dur="5.49">that had a cascading effect and brought</text>
  <text start="2280.34" dur="6.87">the entire grid down that is absolutely</text>
  <text start="2283.31" dur="6.81">ridiculous these were tests because they</text>
  <text start="2287.21" dur="5.73">are preparing for what is coming because</text>
  <text start="2290.12" dur="6">they understand the collapse is coming</text>
  <text start="2292.94" dur="5.1">they understand they need DHS they</text>
  <text start="2296.12" dur="4.89">understand people will be rioting</text>
  <text start="2298.04" dur="6.36">because nobody is prepared in this</text>
  <text start="2301.01" dur="5.37">country and when I say nobody I mean the</text>
  <text start="2304.4" dur="4.59">majority of the people most of the</text>
  <text start="2306.38" dur="5.79">people are completely sleeping they have</text>
  <text start="2308.99" dur="6.6">no idea what&amp;#39;s going on and again we</text>

  <text start="2321.11" dur="5.49">actually bring this home because they</text>
  <text start="2324.05" dur="4.98">need to get this war started before this</text>
  <text start="2326.6" dur="4.68">collapse hits and this is why everyone</text>
  <text start="2329.03" dur="4.5">needs to be prepared listen everyone</text>
