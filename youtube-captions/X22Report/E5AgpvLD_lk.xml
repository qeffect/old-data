  <text start="94.86" dur="4.679">very well and like we&amp;#39;ve been saying in</text>
  <text start="97.41" dur="7.14">the past drum of the Patriots they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="99.539" dur="6.841">been using every single weapon against</text>
  <text start="104.55" dur="4.799">the deep State against the central bank</text>
  <text start="106.38" dur="6.269">against the mainstream media but they</text>
  <text start="109.349" dur="5.91">never expected Trump to do one thing you</text>
  <text start="112.649" dur="5.191">know why because they would never do it</text>
  <text start="115.259" dur="6.09">and they never really thought about it</text>
  <text start="117.84" dur="7.309">and Trump and the Patriots they knew</text>
  <text start="121.349" dur="7.41">that to boost this central bank system</text>
  <text start="125.149" dur="7.211">which is based on people spending their</text>
  <text start="128.759" dur="7.281">money feeling confident they would have</text>
  <text start="132.36" dur="8.7">to do something that was unthinkable and</text>
  <text start="136.04" dur="7.029">that was to give funds currency to the</text>
  <text start="141.06" dur="4.62">people no I&amp;#39;m not talking about</text>
  <text start="143.069" dur="7.111">helicopter money I&amp;#39;m talking about those</text>
  <text start="145.68" dur="7.199">people or out there working take a</text>
  <text start="150.18" dur="5.81">little bit less out of their paycheck</text>
  <text start="152.879" dur="9.101">and those individuals</text>
  <text start="155.99" dur="8.49">who can&amp;#39;t find jobs get them jobs and</text>
  <text start="161.98" dur="8.41">this is what Trump and the Patriots have</text>
  <text start="164.48" dur="10.31">done and you can see the results the</text>
  <text start="170.39" dur="7.11">entire economic system statistically is</text>
  <text start="174.79" dur="4.87">doing better than ever before and</text>
  <text start="177.5" dur="5.52">remember it we&amp;#39;re in a central bank</text>
  <text start="179.66" dur="5.7">system this is not an open free market</text>
  <text start="183.02" dur="7.59">this is not a people system Trump is</text>
  <text start="185.36" dur="8.94">playing within the confines of the</text>
  <text start="190.61" dur="6.15">central bank rules everything is</text>
  <text start="194.3" dur="5.88">manipulated and this is why Trump in the</text>
  <text start="196.76" dur="7.32">Patriots needed to follow what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="200.18" dur="7.29">been doing and boost it like we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="204.08" dur="5.73">seen before and this is why he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="207.47" dur="6.6">hitting the Fed this is why he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="209.81" dur="7.29">setting the Fed up now the stock market</text>
  <text start="214.07" dur="6.09">is key and I know we said in the past</text>
  <text start="217.1" dur="6">the stock market it is not a gauge of</text>
  <text start="220.16" dur="5.22">the economy at which it is not but Trump</text>
  <text start="223.1" dur="3.48">the Patriots they knew that the</text>
  <text start="225.38" dur="3.09">mainstream media the deep state the</text>
  <text start="226.58" dur="4.4">central bank over the many many years</text>
  <text start="228.47" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;ve been using the stock market as</text>
  <text start="230.98" dur="5.14">the gauge if the markets going up the</text>
  <text start="234.65" dur="4.26">economy must be doing really well</text>
  <text start="236.12" dur="5.34">companies must be doing fantastically</text>
  <text start="238.91" dur="6.51">well and Trump with the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="241.46" dur="7.89">knew this and they also knew by lowering</text>
  <text start="245.42" dur="8.34">rates and by starting stimulus that</text>
  <text start="249.35" dur="6.84">would boost the entire market and what</text>
  <text start="253.76" dur="6.45">are we seeing today we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="256.19" dur="7.86">market rise and it&amp;#39;s continually moving</text>
  <text start="260.21" dur="6.03">up Trump tweeted out the following hit</text>
  <text start="264.05" dur="4.89">new stock market record again yesterday</text>
  <text start="266.24" dur="5.73">the 20th time this year with great</text>
  <text start="268.94" dur="5.49">potential for the future USA is where</text>
  <text start="271.97" dur="4.53">the action is companies and jobs are</text>
  <text start="274.43" dur="5.34">coming back like never before and</text>
  <text start="276.5" dur="5.64">remember the central banks they set it</text>
  <text start="279.77" dur="5.61">up where there were no interest rates</text>
  <text start="282.14" dur="5.94">they were very close to zero all those</text>
  <text start="285.38" dur="4.2">pensions that were basing their</text>
  <text start="288.08" dur="4.47">forecasts on said</text>
  <text start="289.58" dur="5.13">or 8% interest they warden getting it</text>
  <text start="292.55" dur="3.239">what did they put that money they put it</text>
  <text start="294.71" dur="3.419">into the stock market because they</text>
  <text start="295.789" dur="4.981">needed to get the returns Trump of the</text>
  <text start="298.129" dur="5.91">Patriots knew this if the market came</text>
  <text start="300.77" dur="5.84">down all the pensions across the country</text>
  <text start="304.039" dur="5.491">most of them I should say would implode</text>
  <text start="306.61" dur="6.429">people would be in trouble they knew</text>
  <text start="309.53" dur="6.33">this they also knew that they needed to</text>
  <text start="313.039" dur="5.25">keep the consumer economy alive what was</text>
  <text start="315.86" dur="6.709">happening to the consumer economy stores</text>
  <text start="318.289" dur="7.921">were closing left and right why well</text>
  <text start="322.569" dur="7.35">first of all we had Obamacare health</text>
  <text start="326.21" dur="6">insurance was skyrocketing the premiums</text>
  <text start="329.919" dur="5.171">continually moved up and up and up and</text>
  <text start="332.21" dur="5.669">up it wasn&amp;#39;t affordable a lot of people</text>
  <text start="335.09" dur="4.039">couldn&amp;#39;t afford it those individuals</text>
  <text start="337.879" dur="4.711">that were dependent on the government</text>
  <text start="339.129" dur="5.921">the lower middle class and poor they</text>
  <text start="342.59" dur="4.319">couldn&amp;#39;t find jobs so they were</text>
  <text start="345.05" dur="3.72">dependent on the government they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="346.909" dur="6.421">have enough to go out and spend they</text>
  <text start="348.77" dur="10.199">didn&amp;#39;t feel confident and when you allow</text>
  <text start="353.33" dur="8.67">people to receive funds unexpected funds</text>
  <text start="358.969" dur="8.85">or you&amp;#39;d have to pay as much in taxes</text>
  <text start="362" dur="10.349">they feel better housing prices as they</text>
  <text start="367.819" dur="6.331">move up people feel better getting a job</text>
  <text start="372.349" dur="3.151">where you&amp;#39;ve been looking for a job for</text>
  <text start="374.15" dur="2.939">a very long time and you couldn&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="375.5" dur="6.719">one and all of a sudden you get one you</text>
  <text start="377.089" dur="11.461">feel better and Trump yes he used the</text>
  <text start="382.219" dur="8.241">magic wand he used it on consumers why</text>
  <text start="388.55" dur="3.869">do you think he gave that tax break I</text>
  <text start="390.46" dur="5.199">think eventually we&amp;#39;re gonna get rid of</text>
  <text start="392.419" dur="6.481">taxes but he needed to do it because he</text>
  <text start="395.659" dur="7.23">needed to boost confidence he needed to</text>
  <text start="398.9" dur="7.91">boost the consumer stronger consumer</text>
  <text start="402.889" dur="8.39">spending has given the economy a</text>
  <text start="406.81" dur="8.279">backbone to withstand spine-tingling</text>
  <text start="411.279" dur="6.221">political fights at home and abroad</text>

  <text start="428.479" dur="5.901">central bank the deep state were trying</text>
  <text start="430.37" dur="8.01">to do remember 70% is consumer spending</text>
  <text start="434.38" dur="9.09">no matter what the mainstream media does</text>
  <text start="438.38" dur="10.379">the central bank does if you give people</text>
  <text start="443.47" dur="7.5">currency unexpected currency where from</text>
  <text start="448.759" dur="7.561">cut taxes and if he cuts taxes again</text>

  <text start="642.13" dur="4.86">doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s going to come true and</text>
  <text start="644.439" dur="5.191">they pushed very very hard they had all</text>

  <text start="660.85" dur="7.83">complete opposite because Trump of the</text>
  <text start="664.269" dur="7.94">Patriots they already plan this out they</text>
  <text start="668.68" dur="7.769">already knew if they went ahead with</text>
  <text start="672.209" dur="7.42">cutting rates starting stimulus giving</text>
  <text start="676.449" dur="5.37">money back to the people the people</text>
  <text start="679.629" dur="5.46">would feel good this is why Trump has</text>

  <text start="687.389" dur="5.071">the deep state the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="690.22" dur="4.92">would be no way they could touch it and</text>
  <text start="692.46" dur="7.41">this was all planned out from the very</text>
  <text start="695.14" dur="7.32">beginning this was the secret weapon</text>
  <text start="699.87" dur="5.02">Trump and the Patriots they knew exactly</text>
  <text start="702.46" dur="6.36">what they needed to do in this</text>
