  <text start="140.18" dur="6.93">keep this system going long enough until</text>
  <text start="143.12" dur="7.11">the transition is completed where the</text>
  <text start="147.11" dur="5.939">central banks move everything from the</text>
  <text start="150.23" dur="6.69">west to the east and we can see that</text>
  <text start="153.049" dur="6.271">this is their plan and their plan is</text>
  <text start="156.92" dur="4.62">then to bring down the economy now of</text>
  <text start="159.32" dur="3.57">course they don&amp;#39;t want to be blamed for</text>
  <text start="161.54" dur="4.59">this so they&amp;#39;re gonna have some type of</text>
  <text start="162.89" dur="5.7">distraction now Trump has taken on the</text>
  <text start="166.13" dur="4.74">responsibility that the stock market is</text>
  <text start="168.59" dur="4.679">his he keeps telling everyone look at it</text>
  <text start="170.87" dur="4.17">and of course as we know the general</text>
  <text start="173.269" dur="3.961">public looks at the stock market and</text>
  <text start="175.04" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s how they gauge the economy if the</text>
  <text start="177.23" dur="3.27">stock market&amp;#39;s going up then everything</text>
  <text start="179.42" dur="4.2">is fantastic</text>
  <text start="180.5" dur="5.61">but what the central bankers have done</text>
  <text start="183.62" dur="5.4">is they waited and they waited</text>
  <text start="186.11" dur="5.25">and they waited until it was time where</text>
  <text start="189.02" dur="5.67">they could say okay the economy has now</text>
  <text start="191.36" dur="7.14">moved to trump and what they will do is</text>
  <text start="194.69" dur="6.18">then bring it down and if that isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="198.5" dur="6.21">enough they might even attach an event</text>
  <text start="200.87" dur="5.97">to this to have complete distraction on</text>
  <text start="204.71" dur="5.07">what is happening here now in the</text>
  <text start="206.84" dur="4.74">meantime the corporate media and</text>
  <text start="209.78" dur="5.25">everyone else is going to tell you how</text>
  <text start="211.58" dur="6.44">great the economy is doing and they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="218.02" dur="7.95">retail industry the holiday season is</text>
  <text start="221.45" dur="7.2">doing a lot better than it really is and</text>

  <text start="228.65" dur="6.059">fantastic people are out there</text>
  <text start="230.51" dur="5.55">purchasing and at the same time Toys R</text>

  <text start="238.61" dur="5.25">continually seeing bankruptcies in</text>
  <text start="240.38" dur="5.19">different stores and after the holiday</text>
  <text start="243.86" dur="2.97">season just like we saw in 2016 when</text>
  <text start="245.57" dur="3.21">they told us everything was fantastic</text>
  <text start="246.83" dur="4.08">and holiday sales is the best they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="248.78" dur="4.86">ever seen all of a sudden everyone</text>

  <text start="253.64" dur="4.08">the same thing once again now coming out</text>
  <text start="256.31" dur="3.69">of the corporate media they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="257.72" dur="5.37">convince us that people are spending</text>
  <text start="260" dur="4.5">like crazy this holiday season now which</text>
  <text start="263.09" dur="4.86">is this is very interesting because</text>

  <text start="267.95" dur="5.73">savings credit card debt is very high</text>
  <text start="270.79" dur="6.25">now if people have less in their savings</text>
  <text start="273.68" dur="7.35">and people are losing jobs they will</text>
  <text start="277.04" dur="6.51">resort to credit cards to purchase the</text>
  <text start="281.03" dur="6.33">items and what they&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="283.55" dur="7.85">is that people are purchasing on credit</text>
  <text start="287.36" dur="6.57">more so than they&amp;#39;ve ever done before</text>
  <text start="291.4" dur="4.6">because they don&amp;#39;t have the savings</text>
  <text start="293.93" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;d rather put it on credit and pay</text>
  <text start="296" dur="4.32">it off so they&amp;#39;re purchasing things with</text>
  <text start="298.34" dur="3.99">money they don&amp;#39;t really have now I know</text>

  <text start="368.51" dur="3.029">happens during this period of time and</text>
  <text start="369.919" dur="6.091">we&amp;#39;ll also have to remember that debt</text>
  <text start="371.539" dur="7.201">comes due for retailers and the actual</text>
  <text start="376.01" dur="4.11">numbers will start filtering in from</text>
  <text start="378.74" dur="3.39">retailers the numbers we&amp;#39;re receiving</text>
  <text start="380.12" dur="4.35">right now that is a government numbers</text>
  <text start="382.13" dur="3.36">the numbers that we&amp;#39;re receiving from</text>
  <text start="384.47" dur="2.819">the corporate media about how much</text>
  <text start="385.49" dur="4.77">people are spending that is from the</text>
  <text start="387.289" dur="5.491">credit card the banks credit bureau</text>
  <text start="390.26" dur="4.08">where they&amp;#39;re saying yes oh wow we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="392.78" dur="5.609">seeing a huge amount of debt remember</text>
  <text start="394.34" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s debt it&amp;#39;s all based on debt but</text>
  <text start="398.389" dur="4.171">what&amp;#39;s more interesting than all of this</text>
  <text start="399.95" dur="5.82">is a couple of reports ago we talked</text>
  <text start="402.56" dur="4.62">about indicators showing that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="405.77" dur="4.5">heading towards a recession a Bank of</text>
  <text start="407.18" dur="6.48">America has this indicator which is</text>
  <text start="410.27" dur="7.59">called the earnings estimate revision</text>
  <text start="413.66" dur="8.61">ratio and this is pretty non precise and</text>
  <text start="417.86" dur="5.73">every time it falls they realize that we</text>
  <text start="422.27" dur="5.579">are headed towards a recession and</text>
  <text start="423.59" dur="7.44">they&amp;#39;re seeing this right now and what</text>
  <text start="427.849" dur="7.32">they&amp;#39;re also seeing is out of the 19</text>
  <text start="431.03" dur="8.28">bare market indicators the 11th one was</text>
  <text start="435.169" dur="7.141">hit which tells us 11 of the 19 already</text>
  <text start="439.31" dur="5.07">are showing that something is about to</text>
  <text start="442.31" dur="4.77">happen that we&amp;#39;re going to be entering a</text>
  <text start="444.38" dur="5.039">recession and we&amp;#39;ve been looking at many</text>
  <text start="447.08" dur="4.95">indicators and when we put all this</text>
  <text start="449.419" dur="5.551">together and we use common sense</text>
  <text start="452.03" dur="4.47">we realize what the corporate media what</text>
  <text start="454.97" dur="3.57">the government what the central bank has</text>
  <text start="456.5" dur="3.66">been telling us has been fake phony and</text>
  <text start="458.54" dur="4.23">false they&amp;#39;ve been setting us up and</text>
  <text start="460.16" dur="5.37">this is what they normally do this is</text>
  <text start="462.77" dur="7.86">their pattern they usually make everyone</text>
  <text start="465.53" dur="8.49">feel incredibly great right before they</text>
  <text start="470.63" dur="6.3">bring everything down go back to 2008 I</text>

  <text start="476.93" dur="4.2">the subprime securities rated triple-a</text>
  <text start="478.61" dur="5.4">with everyone buying multiple homes</text>
  <text start="481.13" dur="6.42">renting them out people flipping homes</text>
  <text start="484.01" dur="4.77">like crazy people taking equity loans</text>
  <text start="487.55" dur="3.05">out of their house because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="488.78" dur="5.42">appreciating very very quickly and</text>
  <text start="490.6" dur="6.85">spending that money on other things</text>
  <text start="494.2" dur="6.1">everyone felt fantastic because when</text>
  <text start="497.45" dur="5.58">your house prices go up the stock market</text>
  <text start="500.3" dur="5.07">goes up you can take an equity line of</text>
  <text start="503.03" dur="3.12">credit and you have a lot of extra cash</text>
  <text start="505.37" dur="5.18">on hand</text>
