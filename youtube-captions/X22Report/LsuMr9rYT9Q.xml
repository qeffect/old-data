  <text start="45" dur="4.1">government needs to keep the illusion</text>
  <text start="46.5" dur="5.07">alive that we are in some type of</text>
  <text start="49.1" dur="4.48">recovery so what they do is they</text>
  <text start="51.57" dur="3.57">continually manipulate the numbers and</text>
  <text start="53.58" dur="3.84">they need to make sure that people</text>
  <text start="55.14" dur="4.68">actually you know kind of believe that</text>
  <text start="57.42" dur="4.349">we are headed towards us recovery now we</text>
  <text start="59.82" dur="3.69">understand what GDP they went all the</text>
  <text start="61.769" dur="3.811">way back to nineteen twenty-nine they</text>
  <text start="63.51" dur="3.87">included research and development and</text>
  <text start="65.58" dur="5.01">they calculated it all the way up to the</text>
  <text start="67.38" dur="5.909">present time to make it seem like GDP is</text>
  <text start="70.59" dur="5.669">still doing fine and it&amp;#39;s growing they</text>
  <text start="73.289" dur="5.131">do a lot of wholesale inventory hoarding</text>

  <text start="78.42" dur="3.449">many other things with unemployment they</text>

  <text start="92.759" dur="4.201">really don&amp;#39;t count those people if you</text>

  <text start="123.06" dur="5.009">implode on itself so they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="125.399" dur="3.931">boost people&amp;#39;s credit scores so they go</text>
  <text start="128.069" dur="2.791">out and they purchase real estate</text>
  <text start="129.33" dur="3.72">because you have to remember they are</text>

  <text start="286.68" dur="4.47">graduated with absolutely no debt and we</text>
  <text start="289.83" dur="2.64">can see that this is actually going to</text>
  <text start="291.15" dur="3">get worse because we understand that</text>
  <text start="292.47" dur="5.939">eighty percent of those college</text>
  <text start="294.15" dur="6.9">graduates cannot find the real full-time</text>
  <text start="298.409" dur="4.23">job in their major yes they might be</text>
  <text start="301.05" dur="3.78">finding jobs but most of them are</text>

  <text start="326.19" dur="4.379">saying yes the same things happening to</text>
  <text start="327.78" dur="4.62">me I have a lot of student loans I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="330.569" dur="4.171">find jobs I continually send out my</text>
  <text start="332.4" dur="4.56">resume but there is just nothing out</text>
  <text start="334.74" dur="4.679">there and also those people who are</text>
  <text start="336.96" dur="4.17">being laid off right now are also having</text>
  <text start="339.419" dur="4.05">the same problem they&amp;#39;re continually</text>

  <text start="348.18" dur="4.32">companies are laying off this is going</text>
  <text start="350.55" dur="5.339">to get harder and harder and we know as</text>
  <text start="352.5" dur="5.37">the fall and winter come we realize that</text>
  <text start="355.889" dur="4.981">there are going to be major major</text>
  <text start="357.87" dur="5.609">layoffs in corporations now we</text>

  <text start="363.479" dur="3.75">coming over the border and that has not</text>
  <text start="365.13" dur="4.62">stopped right now but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="367.229" dur="5.31">interesting is that the Department of</text>
  <text start="369.75" dur="4.71">Justice does not have receipts for more</text>
  <text start="372.539" dur="4.891">than half of the unaccompanied alien</text>

  <text start="405.63" dur="3.96">juvenile in immigration courts there</text>
  <text start="408.39" dur="2.55">seeing the other part of it they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="409.59" dur="3.54">know where it is they don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="410.94" dur="5.34">happened but they say there&amp;#39;s a lot more</text>
  <text start="413.13" dur="4.62">of these unaccompanied children that</text>
  <text start="416.28" dur="3.42">came because really teenagers that came</text>
  <text start="417.75" dur="4.2">across the border and they just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="419.7" dur="4.86">know where they are now we understand</text>
  <text start="421.95" dur="5.94">that Obama right now is moving these</text>
  <text start="424.56" dur="6.39">children to 23 states around the country</text>
  <text start="427.89" dur="5.28">and they just so happen to match up to</text>
  <text start="430.95" dur="4.38">the quarantine zones for Ebola right now</text>
  <text start="433.17" dur="5.58">but what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that all these</text>
  <text start="435.33" dur="6.51">teenagers that are being placed in all</text>
  <text start="438.75" dur="5.34">these different states are now pretty</text>
  <text start="441.84" dur="4.02">much going to attend public school you</text>
  <text start="444.09" dur="4.98">have to remember their Court dates are</text>

  <text start="456.72" dur="4.56">possibly can and right now the feds have</text>
  <text start="458.76" dur="4.68">released more than 30,000 unaccompanied</text>
  <text start="461.28" dur="4.32">minors all of whom entered the US</text>
  <text start="463.44" dur="4.38">illegal it in various states around the</text>
  <text start="465.6" dur="4.44">nation and US public schools will be</text>
  <text start="467.82" dur="3.72">forced to accommodate them now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="470.04" dur="2.79">not even citizens here in the United</text>
  <text start="471.54" dur="3.48">States that came across the border</text>
  <text start="472.83" dur="5.16">illegally but they don&amp;#39;t have a court</text>
  <text start="475.02" dur="4.53">date until sometime in the future there</text>
  <text start="477.99" dur="4.59">was a report that I did some of them are</text>

  <text start="482.58" dur="4.77">court date is so this is way off in the</text>
  <text start="484.44" dur="4.65">future and it&amp;#39;s it seems like this is</text>
  <text start="487.35" dur="5.4">non-stop now the White House is</text>
  <text start="489.09" dur="8.73">preparing for more a spike I should say</text>
  <text start="492.75" dur="6.48">a spike in the amount of teenagers</text>
  <text start="497.82" dur="3.12">coming across the border because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="499.23" dur="6.26">saying when the temperature starts to</text>
  <text start="500.94" dur="7.65">cool they are expecting a lot more</text>
  <text start="505.49" dur="4.99">children or teenagers coming across the</text>
  <text start="508.59" dur="2.94">border so the White House is getting</text>
  <text start="510.48" dur="2.85">ready because they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="511.53" dur="3.77">ship a lot more of these people off and</text>

  <text start="604.14" dur="4.2">nobody knows where these are well we</text>
  <text start="606.81" dur="3.15">kind of know that it&amp;#39;s there with</text>

  <text start="609.96" dur="4.23">they took them and they didn&amp;#39;t release</text>
  <text start="612.12" dur="5.7">them and of course they&amp;#39;re hiding them</text>
  <text start="614.19" dur="5.64">because we know they&amp;#39;re responsible this</text>
  <text start="617.82" dur="3.84">is why they ended the ceasefire this is</text>
  <text start="619.83" dur="3.93">why they were trying to take over the</text>

  <text start="811.17" dur="4.77">speak about it and right now we can see</text>
  <text start="813.75" dur="6.2">every time they talk about cease fire it</text>
  <text start="815.94" dur="7.98">really never happens now it looks like a</text>
  <text start="819.95" dur="5.92">u.s. submarine was detected and forced</text>
  <text start="823.92" dur="4.26">out by the Russian auntie sub forces</text>
  <text start="825.87" dur="5.01">after it violated the country&amp;#39;s boundary</text>
  <text start="828.18" dur="4.74">waters in the Arctic and on August</text>
  <text start="830.88" dur="3.87">seventh a foreign submarine presumably</text>
  <text start="832.92" dur="4.95">belonged to the US Navy&amp;#39;s virginia-class</text>
  <text start="834.75" dur="6.18">was detected in the barents sea by the</text>
  <text start="837.87" dur="5.22">alert forces and it had communication</text>
  <text start="840.93" dur="6">for about 27 minutes and then the</text>
  <text start="843.09" dur="5.55">American sub left the area so here we</text>
  <text start="846.93" dur="4.7">have another little skirmish we had</text>
  <text start="848.64" dur="6.78">Russia bombers flying into the</text>
  <text start="851.63" dur="5.74">international space near United States</text>
  <text start="855.42" dur="4.5">and we see little things going on here</text>
  <text start="857.37" dur="5.04">and there a little bit about provoking</text>
  <text start="859.92" dur="4.26">and flexing their arms and muscles and</text>
  <text start="862.41" dur="4.17">showing that yes we can do the same</text>
  <text start="864.18" dur="4.38">thing and of course this is all being</text>
  <text start="866.58" dur="5.1">done because they realize eventually</text>
  <text start="868.56" dur="4.62">this is going to lead to war eventually</text>
  <text start="871.68" dur="4.23">they want to see what the other country</text>
  <text start="873.18" dur="5.82">is up to and this is going to continue</text>
  <text start="875.91" dur="6.09">as time goes on it will not end now</text>
  <text start="879" dur="5.31">Obama says he won&amp;#39;t let Isis create a</text>
  <text start="882" dur="4.68">Caliphate president Park Barack Obama</text>
  <text start="884.31" dur="5.01">said he was willing to consider broader</text>
  <text start="886.68" dur="5.58">use of military strikes in Iraq to be</text>
  <text start="889.32" dur="5.91">back the Islamist the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="892.26" dur="5.31">militants we&amp;#39;re not going to let them</text>
  <text start="895.23" dur="6.39">create some Caliphate through Syria and</text>
  <text start="897.57" dur="6.3">Iraq but we can only do what we can only</text>
  <text start="901.62" dur="4.2">do that if we know that we have got</text>
  <text start="903.87" dur="4.8">partners on the ground who are capable</text>
  <text start="905.82" dur="4.44">of filling the void well I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="908.67" dur="4.38">say this right now this is part of their</text>
  <text start="910.26" dur="4.41">plan they want a Caliphate and of course</text>
  <text start="913.05" dur="4.11">every time a government officials out</text>
  <text start="914.67" dur="4.74">there always think the opposite they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="917.16" dur="5.43">not giving any type of end time of when</text>
  <text start="919.41" dur="5.22">the bombing will end and they want this</text>
  <text start="922.59" dur="5.13">to really escalate they want to bring</text>
  <text start="924.63" dur="6.03">Syria into the fold they want to somehow</text>
  <text start="927.72" dur="5.61">get into Syria and this is why before</text>
  <text start="930.66" dur="4.77">Congress left on their vacation Caesar</text>
  <text start="933.33" dur="5.31">was there letting everyone know that</text>
  <text start="935.43" dur="5.49">Assad was torturing 150,000 people and</text>
  <text start="938.64" dur="3.76">he had pictures but really no evidence</text>
  <text start="940.92" dur="4.69">whatsoever</text>
  <text start="942.4" dur="5.58">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="945.61" dur="4.02">there are some congresspeople</text>
  <text start="947.98" dur="3.99">representatives out there one of them</text>
  <text start="949.63" dur="4.74">barbara lee saying that you know</text>
  <text start="951.97" dur="4.32">something obama really needs to seek</text>
  <text start="954.37" dur="5.16">prior approval from congress before</text>
  <text start="956.29" dur="4.29">escalating combat in iraq the president</text>
  <text start="959.53" dur="3.84">should come to Congress for</text>
  <text start="960.58" dur="4.92">authorization of any further military</text>
  <text start="963.37" dur="5.16">action in Iraq house concurrent</text>
  <text start="965.5" dur="6.42">resolution 105 which passed the House</text>
  <text start="968.53" dur="6.03">july 25th said the President shall not</text>
  <text start="971.92" dur="5.31">deploy deploy or maintain United States</text>
  <text start="974.56" dur="4.95">Armed Forces in a sustained combat role</text>
  <text start="977.23" dur="5.85">in Iraq without specific statutory</text>
  <text start="979.51" dur="5.73">authorization so he can&amp;#39;t do this for a</text>
  <text start="983.08" dur="3.9">prolonged period of time but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="985.24" dur="3.99">think this was his intentions right now</text>
  <text start="986.98" dur="7.83">I think the intentions in Iraq right now</text>
  <text start="989.23" dur="7.71">was to bomb the area invoke stage one of</text>
  <text start="994.81" dur="4.59">the false flag where the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="996.94" dur="4.98">was going to say okay you just attacked</text>
  <text start="999.4" dur="4.59">us now we&amp;#39;re going to attack you in</text>
  <text start="1001.92" dur="4.23">different areas of the world and</text>
  <text start="1003.99" dur="4.8">eventually hit you in the United States</text>
  <text start="1006.15" dur="4.83">now my question is I&amp;#39;m wondering if they</text>
  <text start="1008.79" dur="3.78">really hit the Islamic state because I</text>
  <text start="1010.98" dur="3.54">know the corporate media is out there</text>
  <text start="1012.57" dur="3.96">and they&amp;#39;re saying yes this is how many</text>
  <text start="1014.52" dur="6.33">militants but when they talk about</text>
  <text start="1016.53" dur="5.73">Milton&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s also the tribes rising</text>
  <text start="1020.85" dur="5.57">up in Iraq because they saw an</text>
  <text start="1022.26" dur="6.15">opportunity to take the opportunity to</text>
  <text start="1026.42" dur="3.07">overthrow the government and take</text>
  <text start="1028.41" dur="3.54">control of the government and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1029.49" dur="5.43">wondering if the bombing was really on</text>
  <text start="1031.95" dur="4.41">those tribes and not on the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1034.92" dur="3.45">state because the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="1036.36" dur="4.44">controlled by the United States Israel</text>
  <text start="1038.37" dur="4.35">UK and other Arab nations private</text>
  <text start="1040.8" dur="3.72">western central bank countries and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1042.72" dur="2.91">wondering if the hit was really on those</text>
  <text start="1044.52" dur="3.689">tribes because they were probably</text>
  <text start="1045.63" dur="5.91">gaining ground gaining more people in</text>
  <text start="1048.209" dur="6.331">their in their fight and way back in one</text>
  <text start="1051.54" dur="4.74">of my reports the tribesmen and the</text>
  <text start="1054.54" dur="4.77">Islamic say they really didn&amp;#39;t agree on</text>
  <text start="1056.28" dur="5.19">the mission and the tribesmen actually</text>
  <text start="1059.31" dur="4.47">said yes we are doing this we saw an</text>
  <text start="1061.47" dur="3.69">opportunity but we don&amp;#39;t agree with the</text>
  <text start="1063.78" dur="4.35">Islamic state and what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1065.16" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re on a total different mission so</text>
  <text start="1068.13" dur="3.54">I really think there&amp;#39;s two things going</text>
  <text start="1069.69" dur="4.92">on here and anything the government</text>
  <text start="1071.67" dur="4.499">officials say are is always the opposite</text>
  <text start="1074.61" dur="3.389">they don&amp;#39;t want to caliphate</text>
  <text start="1076.169" dur="4.651">yes they do this is part of the mission</text>
  <text start="1077.999" dur="6">this is why this was set up they really</text>
  <text start="1080.82" dur="5.609">want something to occur in this area and</text>
  <text start="1083.999" dur="5.52">I really do believe this was staged one</text>
  <text start="1086.429" dur="5.85">of the false flag event and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1089.519" dur="4.86">to see this really pick up as we go into</text>
  <text start="1092.279" dur="3.84">the fall listen everyone thanks a lot</text>
  <text start="1094.379" dur="5.39">for listening be well be safe and</text>
