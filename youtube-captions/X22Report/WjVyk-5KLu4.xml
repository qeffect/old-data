  <text start="107.799" dur="6.831">started with the economic collapse news</text>
  <text start="111.21" dur="6.58">now I know we talked a lot about</text>
  <text start="114.63" dur="6.07">countries not using the US dollar as a</text>
  <text start="117.79" dur="6.2">reserve currency many countries are</text>
  <text start="120.7" dur="6.69">starting to bypass the US dollar and</text>
  <text start="123.99" dur="8.23">India will be making payments for Iran</text>
  <text start="127.39" dur="8.81">for Iran&amp;#39;s crude in rupees India to</text>
  <text start="132.22" dur="7.01">settle its 1.53 billion dollars</text>
  <text start="136.2" dur="4.77">with Iran in rupees from now on all the</text>
  <text start="139.23" dur="6.42">trade will only be done in Indian</text>
  <text start="140.97" dur="7.98">currency and you have to remember the US</text>
  <text start="145.65" dur="7.919">government central bank they are trying</text>
  <text start="148.95" dur="7.25">to get into Syria and into Iran if they</text>
  <text start="153.569" dur="7.021">could they get into North Korea to</text>
  <text start="156.2" dur="7.99">change the way they are doing business</text>
  <text start="160.59" dur="6.179">they want these countries trading with</text>
  <text start="164.19" dur="6.96">the US dollar as the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="166.769" dur="8.791">and as we can see today Iran is trading</text>
  <text start="171.15" dur="8.309">oil with North Korea not using the US</text>
  <text start="175.56" dur="8.55">dollar Iraq at the time before the US</text>
  <text start="179.459" dur="7.411">government invaded was not using the US</text>
  <text start="184.11" dur="5.28">dollar as the reserve currency and the</text>
  <text start="186.87" dur="5.88">same thing went with Libya and all the</text>
  <text start="189.39" dur="5.429">other countries and that&amp;#39;s why the US</text>
  <text start="192.75" dur="6.03">government essential bankers really want</text>
  <text start="194.819" dur="7.111">to get into Syria and which is a direct</text>
  <text start="198.78" dur="5.88">path of course to Iran and there&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="201.93" dur="7.79">one problem and that would be Russia and</text>
  <text start="204.66" dur="9.18">China are backing Syria and Iran now</text>
  <text start="209.72" dur="8.099">Cyprus default risk remains elevated</text>
  <text start="213.84" dur="8.01">says moody now what boggles my mind and</text>
  <text start="217.819" dur="6.551">for those people who are new Cyprus&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="221.85" dur="4.59">still under capital controls in the</text>
  <text start="224.37" dur="5.1">beginning they said cypresswood billion</text>
  <text start="226.44" dur="4.71">capital controls for two weeks and they</text>
  <text start="229.47" dur="4.139">said one more week well it&amp;#39;s been over a</text>
  <text start="231.15" dur="6.899">hundred days but they&amp;#39;re expecting</text>
  <text start="233.609" dur="6.99">Cyprus to make a huge turn around and</text>
  <text start="238.049" dur="6.571">get better but let&amp;#39;s think of this and</text>
  <text start="240.599" dur="6.331">let&amp;#39;s think about this if you had a drug</text>
  <text start="244.62" dur="5.929">addict and you are continually giving</text>
  <text start="246.93" dur="5.94">the drug addict the same drugs and</text>
  <text start="250.549" dur="5.201">expecting the drug addict to get better</text>
  <text start="252.87" dur="6.51">it will never happen so let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="255.75" dur="7.68">Cypress here for a second capital</text>
  <text start="259.38" dur="7.02">controls are still in effect people can</text>
  <text start="263.43" dur="5.859">take money out their money is frozen</text>
  <text start="266.4" dur="4.87">they are robbed of their money</text>
  <text start="269.289" dur="8.701">on investors don&amp;#39;t want to invest into</text>
  <text start="271.27" dur="10.289">Cyprus it&amp;#39;s very difficult to do</text>
  <text start="277.99" dur="6.289">business in Cyprus you can&amp;#39;t open a new</text>
  <text start="281.559" dur="6.241">account and put money into the banks in</text>
  <text start="284.279" dur="8.37">Cyprus and they just piled that upon</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="8.579">that upon that so how are they expecting</text>
  <text start="292.649" dur="5.92">Cyprus to make a recovery well they</text>
  <text start="296.379" dur="3.81">really aren&amp;#39;t the central bankers don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="298.569" dur="4.231">want them to recover they don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="300.189" dur="6">want the paper money they&amp;#39;re putting the</text>
  <text start="302.8" dur="5.97">screws to Cyprus to get a couple of</text>
  <text start="306.189" dur="6.331">things from them one their natural</text>
  <text start="308.77" dur="6.509">resources to their gold that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="312.52" dur="5.519">want they want real hard assets and all</text>
  <text start="315.279" dur="9.801">of this that they&amp;#39;re doing will never</text>
  <text start="318.039" dur="11.85">ever help Cyprus Greece Portugal Spain</text>
  <text start="325.08" dur="7.269">France it will never help the only thing</text>
  <text start="329.889" dur="4.981">it will do is make the country suffer</text>
  <text start="332.349" dur="5.91">even more eventually until they say we</text>
  <text start="334.87" dur="5.329">give here&amp;#39;s our gold thank you oh here</text>
  <text start="338.259" dur="5.611">you could take our natural resources</text>
  <text start="340.199" dur="7.09">thank you that is the that is the main</text>
  <text start="343.87" dur="5.939">prize of these central bankers to get</text>
  <text start="347.289" dur="4.831">rid of their crappy printed paper that</text>
  <text start="349.809" dur="5.7">they created a thin air and trade it in</text>
  <text start="352.12" dur="5.46">for something that is real and by doing</text>
  <text start="355.509" dur="6.5">this and what they&amp;#39;ve been doing will</text>

  <text start="442.21" dur="7.65">see in many times people on the street</text>
  <text start="445.93" dur="7.32">begging for food or shelter because what</text>
  <text start="449.86" dur="7.29">what has happened here is the government</text>
  <text start="453.25" dur="8.01">has been subsidizing everyone with</text>
  <text start="457.15" dur="10.59">unemployment benefits with food stamps</text>
  <text start="461.26" dur="8.97">and many other benefits so nobody will</text>
  <text start="467.74" dur="4.83">be able to see this yes you see pockets</text>
  <text start="470.23" dur="4.65">of this here and there but not like the</text>
  <text start="472.57" dur="5.04">Great Depression so they figured out how</text>
  <text start="474.88" dur="5.73">to hide all this so no so it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="477.61" dur="5.52">cause doesn&amp;#39;t call attention to what is</text>
  <text start="480.61" dur="4.65">really going on and what they really</text>
  <text start="483.13" dur="4.5">want you to do is put your eyes back on</text>
  <text start="485.26" dur="5.82">the stock market all not all eyes on the</text>
  <text start="487.63" dur="4.95">stock market and they figured out from</text>
  <text start="491.08" dur="4.46">the Great Depression and all this time</text>
  <text start="492.58" dur="8.04">how to do this and it&amp;#39;s working</text>
  <text start="495.54" dur="8.98">perfectly now I know we all forgot about</text>
  <text start="500.62" dur="6.48">the the u.s. debt limit and the national</text>
  <text start="504.52" dur="6.84">debt and we&amp;#39;re approaching 17 trillion</text>
  <text start="507.1" dur="6.27">dollars and the debt limit has been</text>
  <text start="511.36" dur="7.05">suspended and they&amp;#39;re just spending and</text>
  <text start="513.37" dur="7.049">spending and spending and Jack Lew the</text>
  <text start="518.41" dur="4.62">Treasury secretary says the Obama</text>
  <text start="520.419" dur="4.381">administration will not negotiate terms</text>
  <text start="523.03" dur="6.9">for the next steps ceiling increase with</text>
  <text start="524.8" dur="8.31">congressional Republicans well we know</text>
  <text start="529.93" dur="5.33">that they are not going to do anything</text>
  <text start="533.11" dur="8.08">with the debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="535.26" dur="9.06">if for instance they decide to stop</text>
  <text start="541.19" dur="6.16">spending because the only way to stop</text>
  <text start="544.32" dur="5.91">this is to stop spending because they</text>
  <text start="547.35" dur="6.15">don&amp;#39;t bring in enough tax revenue to</text>
  <text start="550.23" dur="6.72">cover the full interest on the debt and</text>
  <text start="553.5" dur="5.61">to pay for all these programs they have</text>
  <text start="556.95" dur="4.86">to borrow the money because there&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="559.11" dur="6.06">not enough of it if they stopped doing</text>
  <text start="561.81" dur="5.58">all this everything would come to a</text>
  <text start="565.17" dur="4.32">screeching halt they wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="567.39" dur="4.83">pay the interest on the debt there would</text>

  <text start="574.08" dur="4.17">welfare food stamps the military</text>
  <text start="575.78" dur="6.25">everything would come to a screeching</text>
  <text start="578.25" dur="5.85">halt if they really decided to do</text>
  <text start="582.03" dur="5.79">something which they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="584.1" dur="6.51">because history has shown us that they</text>
  <text start="587.82" dur="5.88">are just going to push this down the</text>
  <text start="590.61" dur="10.07">road again Congress has raised the debt</text>
  <text start="593.7" dur="10.38">ceiling 14 times between 2001 and 2013</text>
  <text start="600.68" dur="5.23">do you think all of a sudden they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="604.08" dur="4.29">just going to say hey you know something</text>
  <text start="605.91" dur="6.3">now we&amp;#39;re just getting really way too</text>

  <text start="616.95" dur="6.18">it&amp;#39;s way past that time and it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="620.34" dur="5.07">matter because there is no way they are</text>
  <text start="623.13" dur="4.59">going to shut this whole thing down</text>
  <text start="625.41" dur="7.47">they&amp;#39;re going to keep going until the</text>
  <text start="627.72" dur="6.84">bitter end and there was another article</text>
  <text start="632.88" dur="4.61">here that says the debt reckoning has</text>
  <text start="634.56" dur="6.42">arrived total debt owed now approaches</text>

  <text start="2201.869" dur="8.58">living there and over 300 houses</text>
  <text start="2204.15" dur="8.49">available for rent and now this may seem</text>
  <text start="2210.449" dur="4.62">like nothing to be alarmed at except</text>
  <text start="2212.64" dur="4.649">only six months ago you literally could</text>

  <text start="2250.92" dur="6.029">find homes and then all of a sudden as</text>
  <text start="2254.249" dur="4.681">time went on throughout 2008 it was</text>
  <text start="2256.949" dur="5.55">getting harder and harder to sell a</text>
