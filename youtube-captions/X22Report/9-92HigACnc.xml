  <text start="69.82" dur="10.06">the government likes to do things or the</text>
  <text start="73.76" dur="9.75">the the FBI or any type of false flag or</text>
  <text start="79.88" dur="6.57">some type of an event they do a lot of</text>

  <text start="228.609" dur="6.551">and this is going to be spreading and we</text>
  <text start="233.329" dur="3.901">know it&amp;#39;s spreading all over the place I</text>
  <text start="235.16" dur="5.04">mean in Spain they&amp;#39;re hitting close to</text>
  <text start="237.23" dur="6.149">fifty percent and in other countries</text>
  <text start="240.2" dur="6.119">Italy Portugal we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="243.379" dur="5.131">exact thing now and here in America we</text>
  <text start="246.319" dur="3.991">you know we changed our calculations so</text>
  <text start="248.51" dur="3.72">everyone thinks everything is great and</text>
  <text start="250.31" dur="5.639">there&amp;#39;s tons of jobs and we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="252.23" dur="7.559">to worry about it but we know that is</text>
  <text start="255.949" dur="7.411">not true now we talked about this in the</text>
  <text start="259.789" dur="7.171">past about Cyprus being the test where</text>
  <text start="263.36" dur="6.57">they&amp;#39;ve taken the people&amp;#39;s money that as</text>
  <text start="266.96" dur="3.58">that we&amp;#39;re in the bank&amp;#39;s they call it a</text>
  <text start="269.93" dur="3.79">ballet</text>
  <text start="270.54" dur="5.73">and we discussed the FDIC Bank of</text>
  <text start="273.72" dur="5.76">England document that was created in</text>
  <text start="276.27" dur="5.97">December of 2012 and that was the Bible</text>
  <text start="279.48" dur="5.58">of how this works and Cyprus was the</text>
  <text start="282.24" dur="6.03">test and now it looks like they are</text>
  <text start="285.06" dur="5.67">spreading this all over the place the EU</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="5.24">gives banks access to savers accounts</text>
  <text start="290.73" dur="5.61">the EU Commission wants future citizens</text>
  <text start="293.51" dur="5.47">open bank accounts anywhere indefinitely</text>
  <text start="296.34" dur="4.8">this measure is especially the large</text>
  <text start="298.98" dur="3.87">international banks they have more</text>
  <text start="301.14" dur="4.26">efficient ways to collect in Europe in</text>
  <text start="302.85" dur="6.48">case of a crash the compulsory levy of</text>
  <text start="305.4" dur="5.94">bank customers so they are doing this</text>
  <text start="309.33" dur="5.69">all over and we see this happening in</text>
  <text start="311.34" dur="7.62">Ireland Australia Canada Switzerland</text>
  <text start="315.02" dur="7.23">America England Cyprus of course with</text>
  <text start="318.96" dur="5.85">this is happening all over the place and</text>
  <text start="322.25" dur="4.27">basically the Spanish government has</text>
  <text start="324.81" dur="4.05">evidence that the savers have begun to</text>
  <text start="326.52" dur="4.44">you know bring their money to safety</text>
  <text start="328.86" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re taking the money out of the</text>
  <text start="330.96" dur="5.97">bank&amp;#39;s right now because they see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="334.11" dur="4.29">happening and again they&amp;#39;re the most of</text>
  <text start="336.93" dur="3.21">the banks are not going to tell people</text>
  <text start="338.4" dur="3.54">hey everyone&amp;#39;s taking the money out of</text>
  <text start="340.14" dur="3.36">the bank oh my god what why is this</text>
  <text start="341.94" dur="4.92">happening they&amp;#39;re going to stay quiet</text>
  <text start="343.5" dur="6.87">about this and I&amp;#39;m sure if you go to try</text>
  <text start="346.86" dur="5.19">to take out a huge sum of money I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="350.37" dur="6.14">they&amp;#39;re going to stop you or ask you</text>
  <text start="352.05" dur="7.58">questions of why you&amp;#39;re doing this now</text>
  <text start="356.51" dur="7.06">billionaires are dumping their stocks</text>
  <text start="359.63" dur="6.43">now there&amp;#39;s only one reason why people</text>
  <text start="363.57" dur="4.68">would start dumping their stocks now it</text>
  <text start="366.06" dur="4.38">says despite the six point five percent</text>
  <text start="368.25" dur="4.32">stock market rally over the last three</text>
  <text start="370.44" dur="4.26">months a handful of billionaires are</text>
  <text start="372.57" dur="6.48">quietly dumping their American stocks</text>
  <text start="374.7" dur="5.97">and fast george soros george soros</text>
  <text start="379.05" dur="3.9">recently sold nearly all of his bank</text>
  <text start="380.67" dur="4.71">stocks including shares of JP Morgan</text>
  <text start="382.95" dur="4.11">Citigroup Goldman Sachs between the</text>
  <text start="385.38" dur="6.72">three banks or sold more than a million</text>
  <text start="387.06" dur="6.96">shares now it is very likely that these</text>
  <text start="392.1" dur="5.19">professional investors are aware of a</text>
  <text start="394.02" dur="6.95">specific research that points toward a</text>
  <text start="397.29" dur="5.999">massive market correction as much as</text>
  <text start="400.97" dur="6.249">ninety percent</text>
  <text start="403.289" dur="6.21">now they&amp;#39;re saying that something is</text>
  <text start="407.219" dur="7.56">going to happen and these people are</text>
  <text start="409.499" dur="8.13">starting to sell their stocks and they</text>
  <text start="414.779" dur="4.41">go on to say that it starts with a</text>
  <text start="417.629" dur="3.421">reckless strategy of the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="419.189" dur="4.38">to print massive amounts of money which</text>
  <text start="421.05" dur="3.75">we see out of thin air to stimulate the</text>
  <text start="423.569" dur="3.63">economy which is going on right now</text>
  <text start="424.8" dur="5.339">these funds haven&amp;#39;t made it into the</text>
  <text start="427.199" dur="4.981">markets and they and the economy yet but</text>
  <text start="430.139" dur="4.441">it is a mathematical certainty that once</text>
  <text start="432.18" dur="4.729">the dam breaks and this money passes</text>
  <text start="434.58" dur="6.389">through the reserves and hits the market</text>
  <text start="436.909" dur="6.28">inflation will surge once you hit ten</text>
  <text start="440.969" dur="4.2">percent inflation a 10-year treasury</text>
  <text start="443.189" dur="5.671">bond lose about half their value and</text>
  <text start="445.169" dur="6.351">about twenty percent and by twenty</text>
  <text start="448.86" dur="4.079">percent and any value is all begun</text>
  <text start="451.52" dur="3.91">interest rates will increase</text>
  <text start="452.939" dur="4.88">dramatically at this point and what will</text>
  <text start="455.43" dur="4.979">cause real estate values to collapse and</text>
  <text start="457.819" dur="5.201">the stock market will collapse as a</text>
  <text start="460.409" dur="5.13">consequence of these other problems now</text>
  <text start="463.02" dur="7.499">what I did was I put this graph that I</text>
  <text start="465.539" dur="11.19">made when I first started x22 report com</text>
  <text start="470.519" dur="9.091">and it is 1929 2008 and 2013 and you can</text>
  <text start="476.729" dur="5.12">see the patterns of the stock market you</text>
  <text start="479.61" dur="5.489">can see when they all hit the same hi</text>
  <text start="481.849" dur="5.29">everyone was talking about how great the</text>
  <text start="485.099" dur="5.4">stock market the economy is fine and</text>
  <text start="487.139" dur="5.37">then boom it just crumbled and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="490.499" dur="4.89">getting to that point right now so if</text>
  <text start="492.509" dur="4.89">you go onto x22 report com go on to</text>
  <text start="495.389" dur="4.86">today&amp;#39;s report you will see this graph</text>
  <text start="497.399" dur="5.58">and I split them up to three separate</text>
  <text start="500.249" dur="4.831">graphs and you can see what it looks</text>
  <text start="502.979" dur="4.17">like and it just looked like a big rise</text>
  <text start="505.08" dur="4.199">up and then it hits the point boom</text>
  <text start="507.149" dur="7.8">straight down and it looks like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="509.279" dur="9.36">following the same exact pattern now in</text>
  <text start="514.949" dur="6.601">Delaware it looks like Mark L signs a</text>
  <text start="518.639" dur="4.95">gun background check bill into law now</text>
  <text start="521.55" dur="4.769">again all these laws that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="523.589" dur="5.31">signing is their null and void according</text>
  <text start="526.319" dur="4.651">to the Second Amendment because the</text>
  <text start="528.899" dur="4.771">people have the right to bear arms which</text>
  <text start="530.97" dur="4.469">bear makes the carry arms is is weapons</text>
  <text start="533.67" dur="3.36">ammunition and armaments or omit the</text>
  <text start="535.439" dur="7.141">definition of marb armaments</text>
  <text start="537.03" dur="8.43">is military weapons and infringe means</text>
  <text start="542.58" dur="5.49">to limit or undermine so shalt not limit</text>
  <text start="545.46" dur="7.85">if you want to you know carry weapons</text>
  <text start="548.07" dur="7.5">shall not limit so basically there is</text>
  <text start="553.31" dur="4.39">completely unconstitutional and</text>
  <text start="555.57" dur="6.48">according to the Supreme Court hearing</text>
  <text start="557.7" dur="6.72">of Marberry verse Madison that any law</text>
  <text start="562.05" dur="4.17">that is repugnant to the Constitution is</text>
  <text start="564.42" dur="3.54">void and that courts as well other</text>
  <text start="566.22" dur="4.16">departments are bound by that instrument</text>
  <text start="567.96" dur="6.6">and the definition of repugnant is</text>
  <text start="570.38" dur="6.58">incompatible or inconsistent so the laws</text>
  <text start="574.56" dur="5.19">that they&amp;#39;re placing on the books right</text>
  <text start="576.96" dur="6.66">now are incompatible and inconsistent</text>
  <text start="579.75" dur="7.77">because the right to bear arms Arms</text>
  <text start="583.62" dur="6.72">shall not be limited or undermined and</text>
  <text start="587.52" dur="6.84">the word that they the forefathers use</text>
  <text start="590.34" dur="11.78">for is infringed upon but it is</text>
  <text start="594.36" dur="12">completely null and void now Israel is</text>
  <text start="602.12" dur="7.09">complaining that Russia is going to be</text>
  <text start="606.36" dur="5.94">selling weapons to Syria and of course</text>
  <text start="609.21" dur="5.67">Israel doesn&amp;#39;t like this you know and</text>
  <text start="612.3" dur="4.17">they warned you know that there a deal</text>
  <text start="614.88" dur="3.98">is imminent to sell advanced</text>
  <text start="616.47" dur="4.44">ground-to-air missile systems to Syria</text>
  <text start="618.86" dur="4.23">weapons that would significantly boost</text>
  <text start="620.91" dur="5.13">the regime&amp;#39;s ability to stave off</text>
  <text start="623.09" dur="5.26">intervention into civil war now we all</text>
  <text start="626.04" dur="5.01">know that the rebels that are fighting</text>
  <text start="628.35" dur="5.67">over it in Syria are not Syrians they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="631.05" dur="7.02">hired mercenaries that are fighting to</text>
  <text start="634.02" dur="7.68">take over Assad because he is not</text>
  <text start="638.07" dur="5.79">trading oil in the petrol dollar there</text>
  <text start="641.7" dur="5.46">is no central bank there and they want</text>
  <text start="643.86" dur="7.46">him out it&amp;#39;s the same reason for Iran</text>
  <text start="647.16" dur="7.11">why they want to go into Iran also if</text>

  <text start="661.8" dur="7.98">depth explaining how each war has</text>
  <text start="666.15" dur="4.4">started and and why each war has begun</text>
  <text start="669.78" dur="4.22">and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="670.55" dur="7.53">always the same reason it&amp;#39;s the central</text>
  <text start="674" dur="6.149">bankers and they are they always the</text>
  <text start="678.08" dur="4.02">ones when they feel threatened or they</text>
  <text start="680.149" dur="4.201">want to implement their central bank</text>
  <text start="682.1" dur="5.79">into another country this is what they</text>
  <text start="684.35" dur="7.53">do the United States right now is losing</text>
  <text start="687.89" dur="6.949">its foothold of each country using the</text>

  <text start="713.839" dur="4.891">invade all these places to stop this</text>
  <text start="716.93" dur="4.89">from happening but there&amp;#39;s just too many</text>

  <text start="754.79" dur="5.4">trying to help the rebels we&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="756.829" dur="6.061">to help the people you know what lets</text>
  <text start="760.19" dur="4.95">Syria worry about Syria instead of</text>
  <text start="762.89" dur="4.77">sending over a hundred million dollars</text>
  <text start="765.14" dur="4.59">of aid why don&amp;#39;t you use the hundred</text>
  <text start="767.66" dur="4.77">million dollars of aid here in America</text>
  <text start="769.73" dur="4.64">but you see what they&amp;#39;ve done here so</text>
  <text start="772.43" dur="5.84">people don&amp;#39;t think we needed here is</text>
  <text start="774.37" dur="7.54">they minish they massaged the</text>
  <text start="778.27" dur="6.52">calculations of gdp unemployment</text>
  <text start="781.91" dur="4.95">inflation so the American people think</text>
  <text start="784.79" dur="4.919">that we&amp;#39;re on the fast track to the good</text>
  <text start="786.86" dur="5.58">times so we don&amp;#39;t need that money so</text>
  <text start="789.709" dur="5.641">this so this allows them to send money</text>
  <text start="792.44" dur="6.57">over to different places if unemployment</text>
  <text start="795.35" dur="6">was you know being reported as fifteen</text>
  <text start="799.01" dur="4.079">percent the Americans would be up in</text>
  <text start="801.35" dur="3.529">arms going wait wait wait wait we have</text>
  <text start="803.089" dur="5.61">our own problems here</text>
  <text start="804.879" dur="6.4">but as you can see from CNN New York</text>
  <text start="808.699" dur="4.5">time polls people are not really</text>
  <text start="811.279" dur="3.99">interested in Syria we&amp;#39;re not interested</text>
  <text start="813.199" dur="4.47">in going to war we&amp;#39;re not interested in</text>
  <text start="815.269" dur="4.5">being over there we have no reason to be</text>
  <text start="817.669" dur="5.22">over there the only reason we&amp;#39;re over</text>
  <text start="819.769" dur="7.56">there is because of the central bankers</text>
  <text start="822.889" dur="7.74">who want to impose and get rid of the</text>
  <text start="827.329" dur="5.16">leaders who are not trading the in the</text>
  <text start="830.629" dur="10.16">US dollar anymore that is the only</text>
  <text start="832.489" dur="12.21">reason now talking about cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="840.789" dur="8.11">there was a record-breaking bank heist</text>
  <text start="844.699" dur="6.51">and they use this scheme which was a</text>
  <text start="848.899" dur="5.52">sort of a cyber attack they called it</text>
  <text start="851.209" dur="6.51">the unlimited operation and they were</text>
  <text start="854.419" dur="6.18">able to steal money from ATMs all over</text>
  <text start="857.719" dur="11.46">the world totaling five million dollars</text>
  <text start="860.599" dur="12.03">and basically you know it you know they</text>
  <text start="869.179" dur="5.85">they did this and they hacked into</text>
  <text start="872.629" dur="5.37">different banks they withdrew the money</text>
  <text start="875.029" dur="5.7">from ATMs all over the world and they</text>
  <text start="877.999" dur="6.03">continually did this and it looks like</text>
  <text start="880.729" dur="7.95">they finally got caught and it was a</text>
  <text start="884.029" dur="6.93">huge crime ring so I mean that you could</text>
  <text start="888.679" dur="4.92">just see what&amp;#39;s going on today with all</text>
  <text start="890.959" dur="10.1">of this but on another note about cyber</text>
  <text start="893.599" dur="11.31">attacks there was a attack on reputation</text>
  <text start="901.059" dur="8.32">changer com they&amp;#39;re reporting that they</text>
  <text start="904.909" dur="11.42">were hit today and it took their site</text>
  <text start="909.379" dur="9.81">down temporarily so you know hey I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="916.329" dur="7.21">thinking that we might see something on</text>
  <text start="919.189" dur="6.93">friday because the DHS is also you know</text>
  <text start="923.539" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re talking about you know how</text>
  <text start="926.119" dur="5.55">threatening it is and how they need</text>
  <text start="928.459" dur="8.54">money for cyber warriors so this would</text>
  <text start="931.669" dur="5.33">be a very good chance of them</text>
  <text start="937.37" dur="6.67">you know doing something so they get</text>
  <text start="940.92" dur="6.24">funded and show people see this is why</text>
  <text start="944.04" dur="6.45">you need us and someone brought up a</text>
  <text start="947.16" dur="6.95">very good point and this was on the</text>
  <text start="950.49" dur="8.25">YouTube channel disaster preparedness</text>
  <text start="954.11" dur="7.12">said you know maybe Syria took down</text>
  <text start="958.74" dur="7.14">their internet so they wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="961.23" dur="7.23">blamed for any attacks on May seventh</text>
  <text start="965.88" dur="4.8">which is a good point I mean if you</text>
  <text start="968.46" dur="4.92">think about it that that could be a</text>
  <text start="970.68" dur="4.17">reason they went down I mean so far</text>
  <text start="973.38" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;re not really getting any type of</text>
  <text start="974.85" dur="6.39">real answer of why this happened and I</text>
  <text start="978.78" dur="12.96">haven&amp;#39;t seen a really good explanation</text>
  <text start="981.24" dur="13.98">of what happened now in California New</text>
  <text start="991.74" dur="6.27">York and DC they&amp;#39;re looking to band 3d</text>
  <text start="995.22" dur="4.98">printed guns not really surprised about</text>

  <text start="1010.81" dur="7.99">ban 3d print printed guns and it also</text>
  <text start="1015.32" dur="8.25">looks like they&amp;#39;re asking the guy who</text>
  <text start="1018.8" dur="7.38">created the 3d gun to hand in all his</text>
  <text start="1023.57" dur="4.879">information on how he created it and the</text>
  <text start="1026.18" dur="7.32">government wants all the information and</text>
  <text start="1028.449" dur="9.031">they cited some some laws which you know</text>
  <text start="1033.5" dur="9.87">it says the amur that will the commodity</text>

  <text start="1061.91" dur="6.01">a tax on violent media</text>

  <text start="1747.04" dur="5.91">herald the end of the Republic Benjamin</text>
  <text start="1750.52" dur="5.64">Franklin and here&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="1752.95" dur="5.49">interesting from John Adams America must</text>

  <text start="1789.46" dur="5.19">tragic consequence of this Adams</text>
  <text start="1791.62" dur="7.26">declared was that America might become</text>
  <text start="1794.65" dur="6.93">the dictator asst of the world she would</text>
  <text start="1798.88" dur="8.79">no longer be the ruler of her own spirit</text>
  <text start="1801.58" dur="9.36">and finally Thomas Jefferson our rulers</text>
  <text start="1807.67" dur="6.12">will become corrupt our people careless</text>
  <text start="1810.94" dur="6.33">the time for fixing every essential</text>

  <text start="1842.89" dur="5.25">effect a due respect for their rights</text>
  <text start="1844.96" dur="5.58">the shackles therefore which shall not</text>

  <text start="1895.08" dur="12.029">us and they have warned us that the</text>
  <text start="1899.82" dur="11.039">government central bankers will be doing</text>
  <text start="1907.109" dur="6.78">this in the future that they fought for</text>
  <text start="1910.859" dur="7.351">the rights but they knew as time passed</text>
  <text start="1913.889" dur="7.711">people would forget and eventually our</text>
  <text start="1918.21" dur="6">rights would be chipped away and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1921.6" dur="6.419">the perfect opportunity when the</text>
  <text start="1924.21" dur="6.39">economic collapse comes to remove all of</text>
  <text start="1928.019" dur="7.29">our rights and the question does remain</text>
  <text start="1930.6" dur="7.74">what do we do at this point do we just</text>
  <text start="1935.309" dur="8.011">sit and say oh well that&amp;#39;s the end</text>
  <text start="1938.34" dur="8.039">because when i first started when I for</text>
  <text start="1943.32" dur="5.28">one I first awoke I thought oh I just</text>

  <text start="1958.769" dur="8.54">thinking further and bigger yes that is</text>
  <text start="1962.789" dur="8.791">still important but what happens after</text>
  <text start="1967.309" dur="8.381">the collapse what happens when they</text>
  <text start="1971.58" dur="7.469">declare martial law they suspend the</text>
  <text start="1975.69" dur="6.299">Constitution or they tell us we&amp;#39;re</text>
