  <text start="58.53" dur="7.32">episode 1690 a.n today&amp;#39;s date is October</text>
  <text start="62.04" dur="6.39">15 2018 and subtly episode is warning to</text>
  <text start="65.85" dur="5.31">trump unwise to mess with the central</text>
  <text start="68.43" dur="5.13">bank let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="71.16" dur="5.55">collapse financial news now as we can</text>
  <text start="73.56" dur="5.79">see the central bankers they understand</text>
  <text start="76.71" dur="5.37">what is going on here and we know that</text>
  <text start="79.35" dur="5.55">Trump continually contradicts the</text>
  <text start="82.08" dur="5.37">central bank and I do believe panel is</text>
  <text start="84.9" dur="5.7">the inside man and I do believe that</text>
  <text start="87.45" dur="6.09">this is being done on purpose just like</text>
  <text start="90.6" dur="5.01">where Trump was out there saying listen</text>
  <text start="93.54" dur="4.89">I don&amp;#39;t like sessions we need a better</text>
  <text start="95.61" dur="4.95">Attorney General actually what he was</text>
  <text start="98.43" dur="4.11">doing was doing the opposite the same</text>
  <text start="100.56" dur="4.68">thing is happening here where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="102.54" dur="4.98">contradicting Powell saying that he</text>
  <text start="105.24" dur="3.93">thought he was an easy money Fed but it</text>
  <text start="107.52" dur="3.69">looks like he&amp;#39;s an interest rate fed</text>
  <text start="109.17" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s not a good thing in what he is</text>
  <text start="111.21" dur="5.43">doing which means this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="114.21" dur="5.49">he wants him to do because he knows if</text>
  <text start="116.64" dur="5.88">he raises the interest rates he knows it</text>
  <text start="119.7" dur="6.21">will bring down the economy he knows the</text>
  <text start="122.52" dur="6.54">Fed will be blamed and Trump through his</text>
  <text start="125.91" dur="5.67">tweets already said listen we will blame</text>
  <text start="129.06" dur="3.81">the Fed if the economy comes down</text>
  <text start="131.58" dur="3.65">because they are the ones who are</text>
  <text start="132.87" dur="6.36">raising the interest rates the economy</text>
  <text start="135.23" dur="6.28">that I&amp;#39;m in control over is doing</text>
  <text start="139.23" dur="4.08">fantastically now of course we know that</text>
  <text start="141.51" dur="3.6">these numbers are manipulated this is</text>
  <text start="143.31" dur="4.59">why we&amp;#39;ve been following the economy for</text>
  <text start="145.11" dur="6.209">such a long time so we understand what</text>
  <text start="147.9" dur="6.24">is really going on here where they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="151.319" dur="4.561">say hey retail is down because of bad</text>
  <text start="154.14" dur="3.78">weather hurricanes and things like that</text>
  <text start="155.88" dur="2.88">no retail is down because the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="157.92" dur="3.6">falling apart</text>
  <text start="158.76" dur="6.57">I mean look at Sears Sears finally</text>
  <text start="161.52" dur="7.14">declared bankruptcy we see the CEO has</text>
  <text start="165.33" dur="5.43">stepped down we see alanna stores going</text>
  <text start="168.66" dur="3.99">through bankruptcy a lot of stores are</text>
  <text start="170.76" dur="3.21">very nervous about this holiday season</text>
  <text start="172.65" dur="3.24">and of course they&amp;#39;re blaming it on</text>
  <text start="173.97" dur="3.3">tariffs and everything like that what</text>
  <text start="175.89" dur="2.97">they&amp;#39;re really worried about is that the</text>
  <text start="177.27" dur="4.59">American person the everyday person</text>
  <text start="178.86" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re not going out and spending the</text>
  <text start="181.86" dur="4.56">money now if we look at core retail</text>
  <text start="183.9" dur="3.3">sales right now they have dropped by the</text>
  <text start="186.42" dur="4.41">most</text>
  <text start="187.2" dur="6.84">in 16 months and restaurants aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="190.83" dur="5.85">doing any better now when we look at the</text>
  <text start="194.04" dur="4.979">September numbers they were expecting it</text>
  <text start="196.68" dur="4.23">to rebound like don&amp;#39;t worry August was a</text>
  <text start="199.019" dur="4.591">slowdown September is going to be</text>
  <text start="200.91" dur="5.939">fantastic but it missed completely and</text>
  <text start="203.61" dur="5.129">the data only went up by 0.1 percent</text>
  <text start="206.849" dur="5.011">month on month they were expecting a</text>
  <text start="208.739" dur="5.491">point six percent rise then when you</text>
  <text start="211.86" dur="5.459">start stripping things out if you remove</text>
  <text start="214.23" dur="6.27">autos and you remove fuel you can see</text>
  <text start="217.319" dur="5.7">that retail sales are not that great</text>
  <text start="220.5" dur="4.739">actually they have dropped and we see</text>
  <text start="223.019" dur="5.851">that fuel prices have been inching up</text>
  <text start="225.239" dur="5.881">and gas station spending has dropped we</text>
  <text start="228.87" dur="5.49">also see that grocery stores are down by</text>
  <text start="231.12" dur="7.459">negative 0.1% health and personal care</text>
  <text start="234.36" dur="6.349">stores are down by point negative 0.3%</text>
  <text start="238.579" dur="6.22">department stores they are down by</text>
  <text start="240.709" dur="6.791">negative 0.8% and when we start to look</text>
  <text start="244.799" dur="5.761">at this we can see that retail is not</text>
  <text start="247.5" dur="6.84">doing well actually if we look at</text>
  <text start="250.56" dur="7.5">restaurants we see they&amp;#39;ve had a huge</text>
  <text start="254.34" dur="5.639">drop in spending down 1.8% the most</text>
  <text start="258.06" dur="4.26">since 2016 of course that blaming it on</text>
  <text start="259.979" dur="5.101">the hurricane but remember the rest of</text>
  <text start="262.32" dur="7.469">the country didn&amp;#39;t get the hurricane</text>
  <text start="265.08" dur="5.58">only certain small towns and think about</text>
  <text start="269.789" dur="3.301">this for a second</text>
  <text start="270.66" dur="4.05">wouldn&amp;#39;t you think retail sales would</text>
  <text start="273.09" dur="4.32">have skyrocketed because everyone was</text>
  <text start="274.71" dur="4.92">out buying fuel right for the hurricane</text>
  <text start="277.41" dur="6.69">everyone was out buying generators</text>
  <text start="279.63" dur="7.14">batteries extra food extra water extra</text>
  <text start="284.1" dur="4.89">supplies you would think that retail</text>
  <text start="286.77" dur="4.26">sales would be skyrocketing you think</text>
  <text start="288.99" dur="4.26">they would be fantastic because people</text>
  <text start="291.03" dur="3.63">were buying double of everything you</text>
  <text start="293.25" dur="3.66">went they went to the gas station and</text>
  <text start="294.66" dur="4.08">they filled up and they filled up their</text>
  <text start="296.91" dur="4.41">tank and then he took out three four</text>
  <text start="298.74" dur="6.27">other tanks and they filled those up so</text>
  <text start="301.32" dur="5.37">you would think that we would see retail</text>
  <text start="305.01" dur="4.14">sales doing fantastically if there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="306.69" dur="6.93">storm ready to hit we didn&amp;#39;t see this at</text>
  <text start="309.15" dur="6.449">all because the overall country cannot</text>
  <text start="313.62" dur="5.07">support what we have today</text>
  <text start="315.599" dur="5.25">people are not spending why aren&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="318.69" dur="5.009">spending it&amp;#39;s because they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="320.849" dur="4.981">high-paying jobs remember what Trump is</text>
  <text start="323.699" dur="5.101">doing right now he is preparing the</text>
  <text start="325.83" dur="6.389">economy for the transition what comes</text>
  <text start="328.8" dur="5.579">after he can&amp;#39;t fix a central bank system</text>
  <text start="332.219" dur="4.59">which is already broken which is already</text>
  <text start="334.379" dur="5.82">doomed the only thing he can do is get</text>
  <text start="336.809" dur="5.76">rid of the globalist trade deals revamp</text>
  <text start="340.199" dur="4.62">everything and make it a positive place</text>
  <text start="342.569" dur="5.1">where manufacturers would want to come</text>
  <text start="344.819" dur="4.64">back to the United States and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="347.669" dur="4.68">what he is in process of doing right now</text>
  <text start="349.459" dur="4.96">we know that Russia and China they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="352.349" dur="4.951">been talking about using their national</text>
  <text start="354.419" dur="4.321">currencies sidestepping the dollar and</text>
  <text start="357.3" dur="4.229">they&amp;#39;ve been doing this and remember the</text>
  <text start="358.74" dur="5.519">dollar isn&amp;#39;t the people&amp;#39;s dollar the</text>
  <text start="361.529" dur="5.01">dollar is a Federal Reserve Note it</text>
  <text start="364.259" dur="4.65">belongs to the Federal Reserve isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="366.539" dur="5.041">that something that people wanted this</text>
  <text start="368.909" dur="5.19">was something that was forced upon the</text>
  <text start="371.58" dur="5.16">people now Russia is out there and</text>
  <text start="374.099" dur="5.641">they&amp;#39;re saying listen when the dollar</text>
  <text start="376.74" dur="6.199">completely implodes on itself or before</text>
  <text start="379.74" dur="5.699">that time we have the ability to switch</text>
  <text start="382.939" dur="4.54">settlements in national currencies with</text>
  <text start="385.439" dur="4.801">maybe any country that&amp;#39;s out there and</text>
  <text start="387.479" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re making preparations to do this</text>
  <text start="390.24" dur="4.56">and they&amp;#39;re saying that Russia and</text>
  <text start="392.519" dur="4.85">British companies could switch to</text>
  <text start="394.8" dur="5.369">settlements in rubles and pounds</text>
  <text start="397.369" dur="5.92">sidestepping the u.s. currency</text>
  <text start="400.169" dur="5.61">transaction and China and Russia have</text>
  <text start="403.289" dur="4.71">already done this Iran and Russia have</text>
  <text start="405.779" dur="4.711">done this and we&amp;#39;re gonna see many other</text>
  <text start="407.999" dur="4.051">countries join in on this and there are</text>
  <text start="410.49" dur="4.949">already many countries that are doing</text>
  <text start="412.05" dur="5.969">this why because the central bank system</text>
  <text start="415.439" dur="6.9">is completely breaking down right now</text>
  <text start="418.019" dur="7.471">and they were expecting someone else in</text>
  <text start="422.339" dur="6.3">office of course and they were expecting</text>
  <text start="425.49" dur="7.289">to move into a war to explain away why</text>
  <text start="428.639" dur="7.08">this system is completely imploding all</text>
  <text start="432.779" dur="4.73">they have now is to blame everything on</text>
  <text start="435.719" dur="5.16">Trump and his tariffs of fiscal policy</text>
  <text start="437.509" dur="5.08">his tax cuts and things like that but</text>
  <text start="440.879" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s not going to work because he</text>
  <text start="442.589" dur="4.68">actually tricked them by manipulating</text>
  <text start="445.589" dur="4.531">the data that they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating</text>
  <text start="447.269" dur="4.62">all along and he&amp;#39;s taken the magic wand</text>
  <text start="450.12" dur="3.75">and said listen the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="451.889" dur="2.861">great why do you keep talking about</text>
  <text start="453.87" dur="2.35">reset</text>
  <text start="454.75" dur="4.92">why do you keep talking about depression</text>
  <text start="456.22" dur="5.13">it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense I mean one minute</text>
  <text start="459.67" dur="4.53">you were telling us that everything was</text>
  <text start="461.35" dur="5.37">fantastic and the numbers were worse off</text>
  <text start="464.2" dur="5.07">now the numbers are better and that</text>
  <text start="466.72" dur="5.06">you&amp;#39;re telling us that we&amp;#39;re going into</text>
  <text start="469.27" dur="5.01">a recession and going into a depression</text>
  <text start="471.78" dur="4.87">something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="474.28" dur="5.88">now former Federal Reserve chairwoman</text>
  <text start="476.65" dur="7.22">Janet Yellen pushback on Trump&amp;#39;s recent</text>
  <text start="480.16" dur="7.61">criticism of the central bank she said</text>
  <text start="483.87" dur="6.55">his comments are unwise</text>
  <text start="487.77" dur="4.93">she said obviously presidents can speak</text>
  <text start="490.42" dur="4.56">out if they choose to and give their</text>
  <text start="492.7" dur="4.95">opinions about policy there&amp;#39;s no law</text>
  <text start="494.98" dur="7.02">against that but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s wise</text>
  <text start="497.65" dur="8.52">to criticize and contradict the Fed at</text>
  <text start="502" dur="7.53">this time now this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="506.17" dur="7.98">because she&amp;#39;s telling Trump back off</text>
  <text start="509.53" dur="7.65">it&amp;#39;s like a warning don&amp;#39;t push us we</text>
  <text start="514.15" dur="5.4">will strike back and we know the central</text>
  <text start="517.18" dur="5.28">bank has the power to do this they can</text>
  <text start="519.55" dur="5.94">control nations they control the deep</text>
  <text start="522.46" dur="6.57">state there there&amp;#39;s the central bank is</text>
  <text start="525.49" dur="6.42">the source of their funding and of</text>
  <text start="529.03" dur="4.71">course the central bank&amp;#39;s never tell the</text>
  <text start="531.91" dur="4.5">people the truth I mean think about it</text>
  <text start="533.74" dur="4.74">go back to 2008 we&amp;#39;re heading into a</text>
  <text start="536.41" dur="4.35">recession the market crash in October</text>
  <text start="538.48" dur="4.62">and Ben Bernanke was out there saying</text>
  <text start="540.76" dur="4.83">listen we&amp;#39;re not forecasting any type of</text>
  <text start="543.1" dur="4.77">recession Janet Yellen right now is</text>
  <text start="545.59" dur="4.05">saying that the yield curve might not be</text>
  <text start="547.87" dur="5.07">a good recession signal in this</text>
  <text start="549.64" dur="6.63">expansion why because it&amp;#39;s different</text>
  <text start="552.94" dur="6.69">this time no it&amp;#39;s always the same there</text>
  <text start="556.27" dur="6">is no difference they tell you this to</text>
  <text start="559.63" dur="5.19">make you look the other way but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="562.27" dur="6.18">happening here is the central banks are</text>
  <text start="564.82" dur="6.09">stuck Trump the Patriots they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="568.45" dur="4.89">after them the central banks know this</text>
  <text start="570.91" dur="6.6">and they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out a way</text>
  <text start="573.34" dur="7.11">to stop it and they will strike back</text>
  <text start="577.51" dur="5.79">with the deep state they will make a</text>
  <text start="580.45" dur="6.69">move and we can see already that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="583.3" dur="4.53">trying to maneuver a way to make it look</text>
  <text start="587.14" dur="2.91">like</text>
  <text start="587.83" dur="3.629">it was all Trump&amp;#39;s fault and the</text>
  <text start="590.05" dur="3.15">Patriots behind him it&amp;#39;s not just him</text>
  <text start="591.459" dur="4.5">alone there&amp;#39;s many people working with</text>
  <text start="593.2" dur="4.77">him to take out the deep state to take</text>
  <text start="595.959" dur="5.31">out the central bank this has been</text>
  <text start="597.97" dur="6.63">planned for a very long time and right</text>
  <text start="601.269" dur="5.641">now we can see that Trump&amp;#39;s mission is</text>
  <text start="604.6" dur="5.46">to prepare the United States</text>
  <text start="606.91" dur="7.5">for the transition away from the central</text>
  <text start="610.06" dur="7.62">banking system to transition us into a</text>
  <text start="614.41" dur="6.239">people system where we don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="617.68" dur="5.87">private corporation of unelected leaders</text>
  <text start="620.649" dur="7.351">telling the people and the government</text>
  <text start="623.55" dur="7.42">how to run the country the system and</text>
  <text start="628" dur="4.95">how do they do this well all they have</text>
  <text start="630.97" dur="4.2">to do is put the country into debt once</text>
  <text start="632.95" dur="3.629">the country&amp;#39;s into debt you can pretty</text>
  <text start="635.17" dur="4.22">much tell them to do whatever you want</text>
  <text start="636.579" dur="6.421">them to do you can start wars over it</text>
  <text start="639.39" dur="7.389">you can have them make certain laws you</text>
  <text start="643" dur="5.61">can push austerity and the central</text>
  <text start="646.779" dur="5.25">bankers figure this out thousands of</text>
  <text start="648.61" dur="7.28">years ago they knew that the real</text>
  <text start="652.029" dur="8.581">control is the creation of currency and</text>
  <text start="655.89" dur="7.66">putting countries into debt because once</text>
  <text start="660.61" dur="5.19">you have a country into debt they will</text>
  <text start="663.55" dur="5.729">have to do whatever you tell them to do</text>
  <text start="665.8" dur="5.789">to get out of debt and this is how laws</text>
  <text start="669.279" dur="6.87">are passed this is how they push their</text>
  <text start="671.589" dur="7.111">agendas and the central banks sit in the</text>
  <text start="676.149" dur="4.171">background these unelected leaders they</text>
  <text start="678.7" dur="3.93">become very very wealthy but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="680.32" dur="4.38">never televised they&amp;#39;re the ones who</text>
  <text start="682.63" dur="6.899">hide in the shadows behind the curtain</text>
  <text start="684.7" dur="8.249">and what is happening today is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="689.529" dur="5.401">pushing them out into the light pushing</text>
  <text start="692.949" dur="5.25">them out into the light so people can</text>
