  <text start="33.12" dur="4.62">22 report my name is dave and this is</text>
  <text start="34.95" dur="6.21">episode 795 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="37.74" dur="5.82">october 19th 2015 and the title this</text>
  <text start="41.16" dur="4.62">episode is US government is bankrupt and</text>
  <text start="43.56" dur="4.95">continually inflating bubbles to keep</text>
  <text start="45.78" dur="4.35">the illusion of a recovery let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="48.51" dur="4.799">right into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="50.13" dur="5.91">financial news now we see today in the</text>
  <text start="53.309" dur="4.591">market the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="56.04" dur="3.78">with their high frequency traders the</text>
  <text start="57.9" dur="5.81">plunge protection team they were</text>
  <text start="59.82" dur="6.66">fighting this market all day long</text>
  <text start="63.71" dur="5.71">pushing it up trying to keep it in the</text>
  <text start="66.48" dur="4.62">green and they finally did it it&amp;#39;s up</text>
  <text start="69.42" dur="4.76">about 15 points but we have to remember</text>
  <text start="71.1" dur="6.059">one important thing the stock market is</text>
  <text start="74.18" dur="6.28">actually meaningless to what the economy</text>
  <text start="77.159" dur="5.941">is actually really doing the stock</text>
  <text start="80.46" dur="6.57">market is the US government central</text>
  <text start="83.1" dur="5.61">bankers indicator for the rest of the</text>
  <text start="87.03" dur="3.449">country who&amp;#39;s not paying attention of</text>
  <text start="88.71" dur="3.99">what&amp;#39;s really going on and as long as</text>
  <text start="90.479" dur="3.78">they can keep that propped up as long as</text>
  <text start="92.7" dur="4.11">they can keep that they can keep the</text>
  <text start="94.259" dur="6.15">market pushed up they feel everything is</text>
  <text start="96.81" dur="6.15">fine they feel the economy is then okay</text>
  <text start="100.409" dur="3.6">and everyone will believe everything</text>
  <text start="102.96" dur="2.729">they&amp;#39;re saying because when you look at</text>
  <text start="104.009" dur="4.29">the market of course it all makes sense</text>
  <text start="105.689" dur="5.311">the markets going up the revenue of</text>
  <text start="108.299" dur="9.36">companies are falling they&amp;#39;re laying off</text>
  <text start="111" dur="8.34">people sales are declining and people</text>
  <text start="117.659" dur="4.261">see precious metals oh look they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="119.34" dur="4.919">falling so everything must be ok gold is</text>
  <text start="121.92" dur="6.33">going down silver is going down dollar</text>
  <text start="124.259" dur="7.201">must be okay but this is furthest from</text>
  <text start="128.25" dur="6.18">the truth because we&amp;#39;ve seen this before</text>
  <text start="131.46" dur="5.52">this is nothing new and I know people</text>
  <text start="134.43" dur="6.48">out there saying no everything is fine</text>
  <text start="136.98" dur="6.24">no it really isn&amp;#39;t and for those people</text>
  <text start="140.91" dur="5.22">who actually are out there saying it I</text>
  <text start="143.22" dur="6.33">would just start preparing for what is</text>
  <text start="146.13" dur="6.35">coming because what is coming is going</text>
  <text start="149.55" dur="6.57">to be absolutely a complete disaster and</text>
  <text start="152.48" dur="5.35">every time we look at the news every</text>
  <text start="156.12" dur="3.21">time we look at the economic indicators</text>
  <text start="157.83" dur="5.7">and every time we look around the world</text>
  <text start="159.33" dur="6.33">we see that every single move</text>
  <text start="163.53" dur="5.7">that the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="165.66" dur="8.72">do is absolutely important to what is</text>
  <text start="169.23" dur="8.25">happening right now because their goal</text>
  <text start="174.38" dur="8.89">their whole motive of what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="177.48" dur="12.2">is to keep this system alive so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="183.27" dur="9.18">able to start an event or create a war</text>
  <text start="189.68" dur="5.41">so they&amp;#39;re not blamed that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="192.45" dur="5.3">they&amp;#39;re doing right now and we can see</text>
  <text start="195.09" dur="9.17">from everything that we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="197.75" dur="11.14">manufacturing retail housing</text>
  <text start="204.26" dur="8.52">unemployment inflation and if we use</text>
  <text start="208.89" dur="6.629">common sense all of this right now</text>
  <text start="212.78" dur="5.65">points to a collapse of the entire</text>
  <text start="215.519" dur="4.561">system it doesn&amp;#39;t point to a recovery</text>
  <text start="218.43" dur="2.7">because you wouldn&amp;#39;t see any of this in</text>
  <text start="220.08" dur="4.92">a recovery and what I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="221.13" dur="8.34">you wouldn&amp;#39;t see retail stores closing</text>
  <text start="225" dur="6.63">strip malls empty sales declining</text>
  <text start="229.47" dur="6.75">already in October sales declining in</text>
  <text start="231.63" dur="7.169">September layoffs mass layoffs you see</text>
  <text start="236.22" dur="6.239">this right before the system is going to</text>
  <text start="238.799" dur="6.571">come down I mean look at Greece for</text>
  <text start="242.459" dur="5.641">instance the central bankers convinced</text>
  <text start="245.37" dur="5.97">us back in 2008 that everything was fine</text>
  <text start="248.1" dur="7.29">in Greece they told us they received a</text>
  <text start="251.34" dur="8.28">bailout they&amp;#39;re back on track and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="255.39" dur="6.99">been six years three bailouts and where</text>
  <text start="259.62" dur="5.19">is Greece today in the same exact</text>
  <text start="262.38" dur="5.099">position well actually it&amp;#39;s a lot worse</text>
  <text start="264.81" dur="8.99">because thirty six percent of the Greeks</text>
  <text start="267.479" dur="10.291">are in poverty so they&amp;#39;re not better off</text>
  <text start="273.8" dur="7.06">they&amp;#39;re worse off and according to the</text>
  <text start="277.77" dur="5.64">European Union what they consider poor</text>
  <text start="280.86" dur="7.65">is an individual or family with</text>
  <text start="283.41" dur="9.96">available income less than 500 euros per</text>
  <text start="288.51" dur="7.83">month think about that for a second that</text>
  <text start="293.37" dur="5.49">is like absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="296.34" dur="4.74">so if we look at Greece we look at</text>
  <text start="298.86" dur="5.779">cypress and we look at the rest of the</text>
  <text start="301.08" dur="6.839">European nations we see right now that</text>
  <text start="304.639" dur="8.441">the central bankers the governments of</text>
  <text start="307.919" dur="8.491">those countries they&amp;#39;re struggling they</text>
  <text start="313.08" dur="7.89">can&amp;#39;t come out of this the same thing</text>
  <text start="316.41" dur="7.5">with the United States the Fed the</text>
  <text start="320.97" dur="5.669">government older doing is creating money</text>
  <text start="323.91" dur="4.67">it&amp;#39;s like bail out after bail out after</text>
  <text start="326.639" dur="5.25">bail out just like Greece no difference</text>
  <text start="328.58" dur="6.91">yes they can continually do this without</text>
  <text start="331.889" dur="8.101">begging for it but that&amp;#39;s actually worse</text>
  <text start="335.49" dur="11.1">isn&amp;#39;t it and we see from everything that</text>
  <text start="339.99" dur="11.58">we&amp;#39;re looking at like I said that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="346.59" dur="8.01">impossible for this system to recover</text>
  <text start="351.57" dur="6.81">and this is why it really hasn&amp;#39;t I mean</text>
  <text start="354.6" dur="6.3">the homebuilders right now they must</text>
  <text start="358.38" dur="6.15">have a crystal ball or something because</text>
  <text start="360.9" dur="8.82">sentiment on home builders surged to the</text>
  <text start="364.53" dur="7.65">highest mark in 10 years now I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="369.72" dur="6">to look at this at a view of common</text>
  <text start="372.18" dur="6.87">sense we see home builders are saying</text>
  <text start="375.72" dur="5.25">yes everything is awesome and if you</text>
  <text start="379.05" dur="4.56">ever saw the lego movie they have a song</text>
  <text start="380.97" dur="4.699">everything is awesome well I hear it in</text>
  <text start="383.61" dur="4.86">my head when I&amp;#39;m looking at this and</text>
  <text start="385.669" dur="5.261">home builders are saying that yeah it</text>
  <text start="388.47" dur="6.24">all looks great so while they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="390.93" dur="7.56">this existing home sales are declined</text>
  <text start="394.71" dur="6.54">declining new home sales are declining</text>
  <text start="398.49" dur="8.64">prices are coming down mortgage</text>
  <text start="401.25" dur="7.53">applications are imploding and of course</text>
  <text start="407.13" dur="3.81">everyone says well what about that surge</text>
  <text start="408.78" dur="3.87">we had well everyone was scared they</text>
  <text start="410.94" dur="3.27">thought the Fed was going to raise rates</text>
  <text start="412.65" dur="3.239">so there everyone was trying to lock in</text>
  <text start="414.21" dur="6.57">and as soon as it didn&amp;#39;t happen guess</text>
  <text start="415.889" dur="8.46">what it plunged straight down we&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="420.78" dur="5.61">of the good season for real estate we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="426.39" dur="4.87">were heading in 2008 real estate more</text>
  <text start="429.82" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s starting to fall apart but don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="443.86" dur="3.72">percent down now of course this is the</text>
  <text start="445.72" dur="4.59">first step to zero percent down now</text>

  <text start="697.6" dur="3.169">or that the only way the government can</text>
