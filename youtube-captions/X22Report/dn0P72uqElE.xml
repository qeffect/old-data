  <text start="139.45" dur="4.11">worse for people and I noticed there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="142.12" dur="3.33">certain articles coming out like in</text>
  <text start="143.56" dur="4.08">Business Insider many other different</text>
  <text start="145.45" dur="4.68">publications that they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="147.64" dur="4.64">the tens of millions of Americans that</text>
  <text start="150.13" dur="5.49">are being left out of the economic</text>
  <text start="152.28" dur="6.459">recovery and they&amp;#39;re saying that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="155.62" dur="5.729">many individuals around 52 million</text>
  <text start="158.739" dur="5.58">Americans live in deeply disadvantaged</text>

  <text start="164.319" dur="4.951">tell you that number is much much higher</text>
  <text start="166.209" dur="5.041">than their reporting and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="169.27" dur="4.109">saying is that the economy was doing</text>
  <text start="171.25" dur="3.36">great it was growing at 2% a year which</text>
  <text start="173.379" dur="2.61">is really not that great because</text>
  <text start="174.61" dur="3.12">remember that number is completely</text>
  <text start="175.989" dur="4.14">manipulated because they went all the</text>
  <text start="177.73" dur="4.619">way back to 1929 added in research and</text>
  <text start="180.129" dur="5.61">development into GDP they manipulated</text>
  <text start="182.349" dur="4.411">the number of how they calculate GDP</text>
  <text start="185.739" dur="2.7">saying</text>
  <text start="186.76" dur="3.509">with unemployment they&amp;#39;re telling us how</text>
  <text start="188.439" dur="4.351">the unemployment rate is around four</text>
  <text start="190.269" dur="5.431">point four percent and everything is</text>
  <text start="192.79" dur="6.71">just fantastic but some people never</text>
  <text start="195.7" dur="7.8">recovered and what is happening here is</text>
  <text start="199.5" dur="6.04">they&amp;#39;re building up to the collapse of</text>
  <text start="203.5" dur="4.5">the system and they just are out there</text>
  <text start="205.54" dur="5.009">telling people that we are headed in</text>
  <text start="208" dur="4.769">that direction and they&amp;#39;re dropping</text>
  <text start="210.549" dur="4.47">little breadcrumbs along the way to let</text>
  <text start="212.769" dur="4.83">you know that we have major problems in</text>
  <text start="215.019" dur="5.25">the economy but again it just started</text>
  <text start="217.599" dur="3.841">just you know this year or so and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="220.269" dur="3.451">just going to get worse and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="221.44" dur="5.519">telling you how the country is divided</text>
  <text start="223.72" dur="5.7">and how certain areas aren&amp;#39;t as strong</text>
  <text start="226.959" dur="5.041">now we knew this because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="229.42" dur="4.95">looking at the country we see certain</text>
  <text start="232" dur="4.17">cities have the housing bubble the other</text>
  <text start="234.37" dur="4.38">parts of the country they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="236.17" dur="4.289">struggling that we see certain parts of</text>
  <text start="238.75" dur="3.329">the country they just you know people</text>
  <text start="240.459" dur="3.93">just don&amp;#39;t have jobs they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="242.079" dur="5.461">jobs malls are closing all over the</text>
  <text start="244.389" dur="6.031">place stores are closing and there are</text>
  <text start="247.54" dur="4.589">very depressed areas now the corporate</text>
  <text start="250.42" dur="4.349">media normally doesn&amp;#39;t like to report on</text>
  <text start="252.129" dur="4.381">that especially when it&amp;#39;s part of their</text>
  <text start="254.769" dur="4.53">agenda but when it&amp;#39;s not part of their</text>
  <text start="256.51" dur="4.409">agenda - you know continually push the</text>
  <text start="259.299" dur="3.721">economy and tell you how great it is</text>
  <text start="260.919" dur="4.051">they start reporting on this and this</text>
  <text start="263.02" dur="5.55">tells us that we are getting very close</text>
  <text start="264.97" dur="5.46">to the collapse of the system we&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="268.57" dur="5.61">saying that corporations are coming out</text>
  <text start="270.43" dur="6.39">with their sales their sales numbers</text>
  <text start="274.18" dur="3.72">like IBM they&amp;#39;ve came out but of course</text>
  <text start="276.82" dur="3.33">the corporate media is saying that you</text>
  <text start="277.9" dur="3.739">know IBM is doing fantastic but really</text>
  <text start="280.15" dur="4.71">when you look at it and you drill down</text>
  <text start="281.639" dur="7.03">IBM has reported about 22 consecutive</text>
  <text start="284.86" dur="6.089">quarters of declining sales which tells</text>
  <text start="288.669" dur="4.831">us that the revenue coming into the</text>
  <text start="290.949" dur="3.72">company is not doing well yeah they can</text>
  <text start="293.5" dur="3.08">talk about earnings because you can</text>
  <text start="294.669" dur="5.071">manipulate that I&amp;#39;m talking about sales</text>
  <text start="296.58" dur="7.18">revenue that is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="299.74" dur="5.94">then we go to housing now we know during</text>
  <text start="303.76" dur="4.8">the summer months because we reported on</text>
  <text start="305.68" dur="5.85">and housing is a disaster</text>
  <text start="308.56" dur="6.21">starts existing home sales new</text>
  <text start="311.53" dur="6.09">construction was a complete disaster and</text>
  <text start="314.77" dur="5.22">this is the best time for a housing we</text>
  <text start="317.62" dur="5.19">are now going into the winter months</text>
  <text start="319.99" dur="5.76">housing is not that strong and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="322.81" dur="5.04">already starting to see that the housing</text>
  <text start="325.75" dur="5.85">starts we&amp;#39;re supposed to just drop by</text>
  <text start="327.85" dur="5.67">0.4 percent but September well it</text>
  <text start="331.6" dur="3.45">dropped by 4.7 percent now of course</text>
  <text start="333.52" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re gonna be blaming this on the</text>
  <text start="335.05" dur="4.02">hurricane saying the Hurricanes you know</text>
  <text start="337.18" dur="4.56">this is why this happened in September</text>
  <text start="339.07" dur="5.16">and they&amp;#39;re gonna make all different</text>
  <text start="341.74" dur="5.34">type of excuses we also see multifamily</text>
  <text start="344.23" dur="5.85">start stumble to 286,000 the lowest</text>
  <text start="347.08" dur="5.43">since September of 2016 but when we look</text>
  <text start="350.08" dur="4.59">around the country</text>
  <text start="352.51" dur="4.5">remember the hurricane didn&amp;#39;t hit every</text>
  <text start="354.67" dur="5.82">single part of the country it hit</text>
  <text start="357.01" dur="5.85">certain small areas and even though it</text>
  <text start="360.49" dur="5.04">hit Florida and Texas the entire state</text>
  <text start="362.86" dur="5.22">was not demolished the hurricane lasted</text>
  <text start="365.53" dur="4.5">for a couple of days and that was it so</text>
  <text start="368.08" dur="4.53">when we look we see the Northeast which</text>
  <text start="370.03" dur="4.53">well that wasn&amp;#39;t hit by a hurricane that</text>
  <text start="372.61" dur="5.19">declined by negative nine point two</text>
  <text start="374.56" dur="5.46">percent the Midwest negative twenty</text>
  <text start="377.8" dur="4.95">point two percent the South by negative</text>
  <text start="380.02" dur="3.99">nine point three percent so when we look</text>
  <text start="382.75" dur="3">at this the only place that was positive</text>
  <text start="384.01" dur="4.5">was that West which was 15 percent</text>
  <text start="385.75" dur="6.45">positive so when we look at this we can</text>
  <text start="388.51" dur="6.63">see that it&amp;#39;s not the hurricane because</text>
  <text start="392.2" dur="4.98">the rest of the country they didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="395.14" dur="4.98">the hurricane and they still and it</text>
  <text start="397.18" dur="4.47">still declined now the corporate media</text>
  <text start="400.12" dur="4.35">like I said was out there telling us</text>
  <text start="401.65" dur="5.43">that the economy is now starting to</text>
  <text start="404.47" dur="4.32">struggle and you know move along here</text>
  <text start="407.08" dur="4.68">and there&amp;#39;s a lot of people that were</text>
  <text start="408.79" dur="5.55">you know out let left out and the cold</text>
  <text start="411.76" dur="5.34">never really recovered we also see</text>
  <text start="414.34" dur="5.19">minuchin he&amp;#39;s out there saying that</text>
  <text start="417.1" dur="6.24">listen if we don&amp;#39;t get these tax cuts</text>
  <text start="419.53" dur="7.68">the stock market bubble is going to</text>
  <text start="423.34" dur="5.67">implode now this is political blackmail</text>
  <text start="427.21" dur="3.96">saying listen you better do what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="429.01" dur="4.55">saying or the stock market&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="431.17" dur="6.6">collapse and he&amp;#39;s trying to scare</text>
  <text start="433.56" dur="7.36">Congress into doing something that they</text>
  <text start="437.77" dur="4.68">want now the market is completely</text>
  <text start="440.92" dur="4.44">manipulated they can bring it down any</text>
  <text start="442.45" dur="6.21">time they want and when you look at the</text>
  <text start="445.36" dur="7.35">market you can see that inflation well</text>
  <text start="448.66" dur="5.01">this plays a huge factor in the stock</text>
  <text start="452.71" dur="3">market</text>
  <text start="453.67" dur="4.53">inflation is going to annihilate the</text>
  <text start="455.71" dur="4.44">stock market the reason in fact the big</text>
  <text start="458.2" dur="4.89">reason the stocks have been soaring</text>
  <text start="460.15" dur="5.01">since 20 November of 2016 and is because</text>
  <text start="463.09" dur="4.92">of the coming inflationary storm stocks</text>
  <text start="465.16" dur="7.13">love inflation at first as it results in</text>
  <text start="468.01" dur="7.92">asset price rising however stocks</text>
  <text start="472.29" dur="6.73">absolutely hate inflation once it starts</text>
  <text start="475.93" dur="6.24">eating into profits when this happens</text>
  <text start="479.02" dur="5.78">companies begin to lose money as higher</text>
  <text start="482.17" dur="6.15">operating costs eats into their profits</text>
  <text start="484.8" dur="6.82">now when we look at the corporate</text>
  <text start="488.32" dur="6.96">profits pre-tax we can see that well</text>
  <text start="491.62" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s starting to decline and we see that</text>
  <text start="495.28" dur="4.92">this is going to be a problem so what</text>
  <text start="497.38" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;re looking at is the N cycle where</text>
  <text start="500.2" dur="5.55">corporate profits begin to roll over and</text>
  <text start="502.78" dur="4.53">they continually roll over and all of a</text>
  <text start="505.75" dur="3.71">sudden we have a major problem because</text>
  <text start="507.31" dur="4.41">profit margins are shrinking as</text>
  <text start="509.46" dur="5.53">inflation begins eating away at profits</text>
  <text start="511.72" dur="5.07">and this is just the beginning what</text>
  <text start="514.99" dur="2.79">happens when inflation really starts to</text>
  <text start="516.79" dur="3.48">bite into stocks</text>
  <text start="517.78" dur="6.12">well everything starts to fall apart and</text>
  <text start="520.27" dur="6.54">it comes tumbling down and we see that</text>
  <text start="523.9" dur="5.52">this is being backed up by the corporate</text>
  <text start="526.81" dur="4.32">media if we look at in Yahoo they had an</text>
  <text start="529.42" dur="4.14">article out there saying that the storm</text>
  <text start="531.13" dur="5.91">that could cause the next stock market</text>
  <text start="533.56" dur="6.18">crash is brewing if you notice they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="537.04" dur="5.34">using the corporate media to let</text>
  <text start="539.74" dur="5.61">everyone know that something is about to</text>
  <text start="542.38" dur="5.01">happen that this recovery is not really</text>
  <text start="545.35" dur="4.59">a recovery the stock market is</text>
  <text start="547.39" dur="5.88">overvalued there is a storm brewing and</text>
  <text start="549.94" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;ve done this before before 2008</text>
  <text start="553.27" dur="4.11">they drop little breadcrumbs to let you</text>
