  <text start="84.54" dur="6.15">around the world only see their currency</text>
  <text start="88.02" dur="4.59">as the right currency to use the only</text>
  <text start="90.69" dur="4.95">currency that you should be using</text>
  <text start="92.61" dur="6.93">because it&amp;#39;s centralized its controlled</text>
  <text start="95.64" dur="5.97">and that&amp;#39;s all they want they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="99.54" dur="3.45">you looking at precious metals they</text>
  <text start="101.61" dur="5.6">don&amp;#39;t want you looking at cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="102.99" dur="7.17">and they&amp;#39;re really pushing their agenda</text>
  <text start="107.21" dur="4.36">full-speed ahead here if you look at</text>
  <text start="110.16" dur="3.599">precious metals they&amp;#39;ve been suppressing</text>
  <text start="111.57" dur="4.74">this for a very long time out of nowhere</text>
  <text start="113.759" dur="5.341">all of a sudden paper contracts are</text>
  <text start="116.31" dur="4.979">thrown at it and gold and silver they</text>
  <text start="119.1" dur="4.35">drop it looks like they&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="121.289" dur="5.131">same thing to the cryptocurrency market</text>
  <text start="123.45" dur="4.85">with Bitcoin all of a sudden there is</text>
  <text start="126.42" dur="6.09">absolutely no news whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="128.3" dur="7.33">Bitcoin all of a sudden tumbles back to</text>
  <text start="132.51" dur="6.54">near lows same thing with aetherium and</text>
  <text start="135.63" dur="4.83">they started this process a while ago</text>
  <text start="139.05" dur="4.5">where they were saying that</text>
  <text start="140.46" dur="6.51">cryptocurrency or Bitcoin you can&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="143.55" dur="5.82">it criminals use it terrorists use it</text>
  <text start="146.97" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s not a store of wealth and we saw</text>
  <text start="149.37" dur="5.55">the Fed and I mean these central banks</text>
  <text start="151.83" dur="5.31">come out like the IMF the biz parts of</text>
  <text start="154.92" dur="4.95">the Fed come out and say yeah crypto</text>
  <text start="157.14" dur="5.97">currencies you shouldn&amp;#39;t be investing or</text>
  <text start="159.87" dur="5.16">using it whatsoever we saw already that</text>
  <text start="163.11" dur="5.55">the banks were planning to set up</text>
  <text start="165.03" dur="5.55">trading desks to trade crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="168.66" dur="4.77">and now they&amp;#39;re pulling back</text>
  <text start="170.58" dur="4.53">actually Goldman Sachs is putting its</text>
  <text start="173.43" dur="4.29">plan to build a crypto trading desk on</text>
  <text start="175.11" dur="4.14">hold right now and I do believe this was</text>
  <text start="177.72" dur="2.73">all part of the plan and most likely</text>
  <text start="179.25" dur="2.91">we&amp;#39;re gonna see other Bane&amp;#39;s come out</text>
  <text start="180.45" dur="4.29">say you know something maybe we</text>
  <text start="182.16" dur="4.62">shouldn&amp;#39;t set up a trading desk right</text>
  <text start="184.74" dur="3.42">now because it&amp;#39;s very volatile</text>
  <text start="186.78" dur="4.32">and we shouldn&amp;#39;t get involved in this</text>
  <text start="188.16" dur="5.79">and it when you look at this you can see</text>
  <text start="191.1" dur="7.23">the plan stage one by as much as the</text>
  <text start="193.95" dur="7.17">coin as you possibly can pump it up make</text>
  <text start="198.33" dur="5.84">it into a bubble even though there</text>
  <text start="201.12" dur="5.19">wasn&amp;#39;t a lot of individuals in on this a</text>
  <text start="204.17" dur="4.75">lot of people didn&amp;#39;t even know about</text>
  <text start="206.31" dur="4.25">Bitcoin they bought as much as they</text>
  <text start="208.92" dur="4.98">possibly could to make it look like</text>
  <text start="210.56" dur="6.81">everyone was buying it then come out</text>
  <text start="213.9" dur="7.17">with the news where criminals use it</text>
  <text start="217.37" dur="5.8">terrorists use it it&amp;#39;s no good it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="221.07" dur="5.96">a store of wealth and continue that news</text>
  <text start="223.17" dur="8.039">as the bubble grows then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="227.03" dur="6.67">dump a lot of the coins now Jeff Nielsen</text>
  <text start="231.209" dur="4.591">before this even happened he actually I</text>
  <text start="233.7" dur="5.31">did an interview with him he actually</text>
  <text start="235.8" dur="5.76">said this was their plan and this is</text>
  <text start="239.01" dur="5.97">exactly what happened here</text>
  <text start="241.56" dur="5.13">then all of a sudden Bitcoin tumbles and</text>
  <text start="244.98" dur="3.99">they continually dumped every time they</text>
  <text start="246.69" dur="4.65">dumped it fell down further and further</text>
  <text start="248.97" dur="5.43">and the central banks came out and</text>
  <text start="251.34" dur="6.179">they&amp;#39;d even demonized it even further to</text>
  <text start="254.4" dur="4.55">make sure people got the message that</text>
  <text start="257.519" dur="4.201">you shouldn&amp;#39;t be anywhere near</text>
  <text start="258.95" dur="5.95">cryptocurrency then they let</text>
  <text start="261.72" dur="5.61">cryptocurrency go and all of a sudden we</text>
  <text start="264.9" dur="4.56">see some days where it&amp;#39;s suppressed just</text>
  <text start="267.33" dur="5.52">like gold and silver really no</text>
  <text start="269.46" dur="4.92">difference here and banks then said hey</text>
  <text start="272.85" dur="3">you know something this looks</text>
  <text start="274.38" dur="3.75">interesting we&amp;#39;re gonna be setting up</text>
  <text start="275.85" dur="4.86">crypto currency desks we&amp;#39;re gonna trade</text>
  <text start="278.13" dur="4.26">in it and people thought oh well this</text>
  <text start="280.71" dur="7.67">might be something that I might be</text>
  <text start="282.39" dur="9.089">interested in well all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="288.38" dur="5.349">cryptocurrency Bitcoin and others they</text>

  <text start="299.46" dur="4.44">this they did the same thing with gold</text>
  <text start="301.979" dur="4.801">and silver remember it&amp;#39;s a barbarous</text>
  <text start="303.9" dur="5.55">relic nobody owns it why would you the</text>
  <text start="306.78" dur="4.47">central banks yeah it was at one time it</text>

  <text start="370.09" dur="3.419">the economy now we know the Fed they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="372.37" dur="3.51">been changing a lot of their</text>
  <text start="373.509" dur="5.22">calculations hiding a lot of data we</text>
  <text start="375.88" dur="5.37">know corporations once sales start to</text>
  <text start="378.729" dur="4.56">decline what do they do they start</text>
  <text start="381.25" dur="4.979">hiding their information now a couple of</text>
  <text start="383.289" dur="5.901">months ago we announced that US</text>
  <text start="386.229" dur="7.321">automakers they would no longer disclose</text>
  <text start="389.19" dur="6.759">monthly sales now when we heard about</text>
  <text start="393.55" dur="5.13">this we knew exactly why they were going</text>
  <text start="395.949" dur="4.831">to do this we knew that their sales were</text>
  <text start="398.68" dur="3.57">going to fall remember prior to this</text>
  <text start="400.78" dur="3.359">what were they doing they were channel</text>
  <text start="402.25" dur="4.53">stuffing the Lots they were bringing in</text>
  <text start="404.139" dur="4.321">the sub subprime people anyone that had</text>
  <text start="406.78" dur="4.52">a heartbeat they were able to purchase a</text>
  <text start="408.46" dur="6">car and now things are changing</text>
  <text start="411.3" dur="5.919">dramatically and when we look at August</text>
  <text start="414.46" dur="5.579">sales we can see that sales have</text>
  <text start="417.219" dur="5.07">declined now we don&amp;#39;t have the exact</text>
  <text start="420.039" dur="5.481">reporting but it looks like there was a</text>
  <text start="422.289" dur="6.87">leak and Bloomberg leaked last month&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="425.52" dur="7.899">reporting of what GM sold and their</text>
  <text start="429.159" dur="7.1">sales plunged by 13% and we can see why</text>
  <text start="433.419" dur="6.631">they&amp;#39;re hiding their information and</text>
  <text start="436.259" dur="7.451">what is going to happen here is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="440.05" dur="5.58">going to continually hide data so we</text>
  <text start="443.71" dur="4.049">don&amp;#39;t know exactly what&amp;#39;s going on why</text>
  <text start="445.63" dur="5.459">are they doing this why would they hide</text>
  <text start="447.759" dur="5.491">all their data the reason for this is</text>
  <text start="451.089" dur="2.48">because the economy is breaking down we</text>
  <text start="453.25" dur="1.669">need to</text>
  <text start="453.569" dur="4.261">remember something very very important</text>
  <text start="454.919" dur="4.411">here I know Trump is out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="457.83" dur="5.369">telling us that this economy is booming</text>
  <text start="459.33" dur="5.459">this is for the show this is to take</text>
  <text start="463.199" dur="3.541">everything that the deep state the</text>
  <text start="464.789" dur="5.43">central bankers have done all throughout</text>
  <text start="466.74" dur="5.729">this time and use it against them how do</text>
  <text start="470.219" dur="4.021">you do this well you take what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="472.469" dur="3">been doing for years and we know because</text>
  <text start="474.24" dur="2.669">we&amp;#39;ve been following this for a very</text>
  <text start="475.469" dur="3.84">long time and this is one of the reasons</text>
  <text start="476.909" dur="4.141">why we&amp;#39;ve been following the economy so</text>
  <text start="479.309" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s not like a shock like wait a minute</text>
  <text start="481.05" dur="3.72">the economy&amp;#39;s doing well the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="483.149" dur="3.42">doing bad are they manipulating aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="484.77" dur="3.179">they manipulating we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="486.569" dur="4.291">this for a very long time for a very</text>
  <text start="487.949" dur="4.59">specific reason so we know exactly what</text>
  <text start="490.86" dur="4.259">is going on now they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="492.539" dur="4.77">manipulating GDP numbers unemployment</text>
  <text start="495.119" dur="4.26">numbers you name it they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="497.309" dur="5.16">manipulating it so Trump took those same</text>
  <text start="499.379" dur="5.22">exact manipulating calculations and used</text>
  <text start="502.469" dur="4.771">it against them and then he want to step</text>
  <text start="504.599" dur="4.56">further manipulated it he even further</text>
  <text start="507.24" dur="5.279">this way to show that the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="509.159" dur="4.831">doing even better then it was doing with</text>
  <text start="512.519" dur="2.55">them in charge now what are they going</text>
  <text start="513.99" dur="2.789">what they&amp;#39;re gonna turn around and say</text>
  <text start="515.069" dur="3.21">hey you&amp;#39;re manipulating all the numbers</text>
  <text start="516.779" dur="3.54">well then at that point only has to do</text>
  <text start="518.279" dur="4.591">is say hey listen if I&amp;#39;m manipulating</text>
  <text start="520.319" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;ve taken your calculations and those</text>
  <text start="522.87" dur="3.51">were manipulated because we were using</text>
  <text start="524.279" dur="5.461">those calculations and for many aspects</text>
  <text start="526.38" dur="4.53">of the economy we&amp;#39;re still using them so</text>
  <text start="529.74" dur="2.459">they&amp;#39;re not gonna say anything they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="530.91" dur="2.94">gonna keep it very very quiet very</text>
  <text start="532.199" dur="4.651">they&amp;#39;re gonna keep it on the down low</text>
  <text start="533.85" dur="5.13">and he&amp;#39;s going to use this to make it</text>
  <text start="536.85" dur="6.179">look like the economy&amp;#39;s doing well why</text>
  <text start="538.98" dur="5.94">so we can switch it around and blame the</text>
  <text start="543.029" dur="5.851">Fed this is what this is all about this</text>
  <text start="544.92" dur="6.87">is the first stage of taking the</text>
  <text start="548.88" dur="6.09">narrative and controlling it and it is</text>
  <text start="551.79" dur="5.549">working and we could see when we look at</text>
  <text start="554.97" dur="4.95">the global economy the global financial</text>
  <text start="557.339" dur="6.511">system everything that we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="559.92" dur="6.539">not by accident currencies don&amp;#39;t melt</text>
  <text start="563.85" dur="4.739">down randomly this is only the first</text>
  <text start="566.459" dur="4.411">stage of a complete reordering of the</text>
  <text start="568.589" dur="4.141">global financial system I mean let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="570.87" dur="5.399">take a look at the Shanghai Stock</text>
  <text start="572.73" dur="5.94">Exchange in China what do we see well we</text>
  <text start="576.269" dur="6">see the Shanghai Stock Exchange</text>
  <text start="578.67" dur="6.149">declining a complete meltdown more</text>
  <text start="582.269" dur="4.891">specifically a four month battle to</text>

  <text start="589.89" dur="6.93">once the support finally broke the index</text>
  <text start="592.98" dur="7.5">crashed now take a look at the u.s. SP</text>
  <text start="596.82" dur="6.06">500 stock market what do we say well</text>
  <text start="600.48" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s soaring to new highs not just</text>
  <text start="602.88" dur="4.68">climbing a wall of worrying but leaping</text>

  <text start="658.62" dur="7.14">doesn&amp;#39;t last forever and this is why</text>
  <text start="661.59" dur="6.47">we&amp;#39;re seeing anomalies in the entire</text>
  <text start="665.76" dur="4.35">system things that don&amp;#39;t even make sense</text>
  <text start="668.06" dur="5.56">because what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is</text>
  <text start="670.11" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re trying to hide certain data and</text>
  <text start="673.62" dur="4.01">manipulate certain data to make it look</text>
  <text start="676.2" dur="3.99">like it&amp;#39;s a lot better than it really is</text>
  <text start="677.63" dur="4.68">but when you see through this you can</text>
  <text start="680.19" dur="4.53">see these things don&amp;#39;t make sense and</text>
  <text start="682.31" dur="4.36">they haven&amp;#39;t made sense for a very long</text>
  <text start="684.72" dur="5.12">time now we&amp;#39;re getting to the stage</text>
  <text start="686.67" dur="5.97">where it really doesn&amp;#39;t make sense and</text>
  <text start="689.84" dur="5.89">the global financial system remember its</text>
  <text start="692.64" dur="5.48">interconnected right now and the whole</text>
  <text start="695.73" dur="5.46">thing is melting down all at once</text>
  <text start="698.12" dur="6.64">now is it going to melt down completely</text>
  <text start="701.19" dur="6.15">yeah yet is this is being done on</text>
  <text start="704.76" dur="6.03">purpose they want the system to melt</text>
  <text start="707.34" dur="4.74">down this way they can make their move</text>
  <text start="710.79" dur="3.78">to get rid of the central banking system</text>
  <text start="712.08" dur="5.43">to get rid of the central banking system</text>
  <text start="714.57" dur="6.06">what do you have to do you have to</text>
  <text start="717.51" dur="7.95">create an atmosphere where</text>
  <text start="720.63" dur="9.57">they are responsible for destroying the</text>
  <text start="725.46" dur="7.71">world economy without doing this the</text>
  <text start="730.2" dur="7.02">people around the world will won&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="733.17" dur="6.75">look at the central banks so by creating</text>
  <text start="737.22" dur="4.26">this atmosphere that they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="739.92" dur="4.2">who are responsible they&amp;#39;re the ones who</text>
  <text start="741.48" dur="6.75">are in control and their system died</text>
  <text start="744.12" dur="5.88">remember they were planning on a war an</text>
  <text start="748.23" dur="3.87">event to cover this up because they know</text>
  <text start="750" dur="6.42">their systems and if you go through</text>
  <text start="752.1" dur="5.55">history only last 40 to 45 years then it</text>
  <text start="756.42" dur="2.46">breaks down then we have to go to war</text>
  <text start="757.65" dur="4.2">then they reset it</text>
  <text start="758.88" dur="5.04">remember currencies don&amp;#39;t melt down</text>
  <text start="761.85" dur="3.57">randomly this is only the first stage of</text>
  <text start="763.92" dur="4.41">a complete reordering of the global</text>
  <text start="765.42" dur="5.34">financial system a reordering that will</text>
  <text start="768.33" dur="5.13">reprice all the assets currently</text>
  <text start="770.76" dur="6.05">bubbling at absurd levels to a much</text>
  <text start="773.46" dur="5.99">lower value a valuation this is on</text>
  <text start="776.81" dur="6.22">purpose this is why Trump came out and</text>
  <text start="779.45" dur="6.28">started to criticize the Fed this was</text>
  <text start="783.03" dur="4.35">the beginning stages where he said</text>
  <text start="785.73" dur="3.39">listen I don&amp;#39;t know why you&amp;#39;re raising</text>
  <text start="787.38" dur="2.64">interest rates right now this is not</text>
  <text start="789.12" dur="3.21">really a good time</text>
  <text start="790.02" dur="6.36">but I&amp;#39;ll leave it up to you because you</text>
  <text start="792.33" dur="7.8">know best this was part of the plan now</text>
  <text start="796.38" dur="7.71">remember the Federal Reserve was created</text>
  <text start="800.13" dur="5.1">by an act of Congress in 1913 a lot of</text>
  <text start="804.09" dur="4.17">people questioned if this was even</text>
  <text start="805.23" dur="5.01">ratified under its Carn structure the</text>
  <text start="808.26" dur="4.05">seven members of the Fed Board of</text>
  <text start="810.24" dur="4.59">Governors from whom the chair is also</text>
  <text start="812.31" dur="3.93">selected are nominated by the president</text>
  <text start="814.83" dur="4.59">United States and confirmed by the</text>
  <text start="816.24" dur="5.61">Senate if the President and Senate were</text>
  <text start="819.42" dur="5.07">to pick the Board of Directors and CEO</text>
  <text start="821.85" dur="4.38">of Exxon and this group then had regular</text>
  <text start="824.49" dur="4.32">meetings to announce its targets for</text>
  <text start="826.23" dur="4.59">price of crude oil nobody in the</text>
  <text start="828.81" dur="3.9">financial press would dream of calling</text>
  <text start="830.82" dur="4.68">Exxon&amp;#39;s decisions independent of</text>
  <text start="832.71" dur="5.61">politics it would clearly be a state-run</text>
  <text start="835.5" dur="4.83">company utterly subservient to</text>
  <text start="838.32" dur="4.83">Washington well isn&amp;#39;t this what we see</text>
  <text start="840.33" dur="5.58">happening with the central bank but</text>
  <text start="843.15" dur="5.36">they&amp;#39;re completely independent and they</text>
  <text start="845.91" dur="4.96">work on their own well do they really</text>
  <text start="848.51" dur="5.07">know</text>
  <text start="850.87" dur="5.32">they work with the deep state they work</text>
  <text start="853.58" dur="8.13">with many individuals and it&amp;#39;s not to</text>
  <text start="856.19" dur="8.57">the benefit of the people now Trump let</text>
  <text start="861.71" dur="6.9">the American people in on a dirty secret</text>
  <text start="864.76" dur="7.329">the central bank is by its very nature a</text>
  <text start="868.61" dur="6.12">political institution that exists to</text>
  <text start="872.089" dur="7.201">serve the nation&amp;#39;s rich and powerful</text>
  <text start="874.73" dur="8.49">class not the average everyday American</text>
  <text start="879.29" dur="6.65">person and when he did this he was</text>
  <text start="883.22" dur="5.1">calling them out each and every time</text>
  <text start="885.94" dur="4.12">when they asked about the feds</text>
  <text start="888.32" dur="5.1">independence are they doing the right</text>
  <text start="890.06" dur="5.7">thing are they political and basically</text>
  <text start="893.42" dur="4.32">this is the beginning stages remember</text>
  <text start="895.76" dur="3.78">you can&amp;#39;t dump this on the American</text>
  <text start="897.74" dur="4.91">people and a lot of people that have</text>
  <text start="899.54" dur="7.049">been listening to alternative media</text>
  <text start="902.65" dur="6.43">researching the Fed we all know what</text>
  <text start="906.589" dur="5.101">this is all about if you talk to the</text>
  <text start="909.08" dur="5.46">everyday person they have no clue what</text>
  <text start="911.69" dur="4.5">the Fed is what the central bank is what</text>
  <text start="914.54" dur="4.26">their role is they think it&amp;#39;s part of</text>
  <text start="916.19" dur="5.67">the government so just like everything</text>
  <text start="918.8" dur="5.43">else as we&amp;#39;re seeing right now you have</text>
  <text start="921.86" dur="4.56">to start to drop breadcrumbs a little</text>
  <text start="924.23" dur="3.93">bit at a time get people used to the</text>
  <text start="926.42" dur="4.05">idea now a lot of people probably even</text>
  <text start="928.16" dur="4.29">hear of this probably don&amp;#39;t even realize</text>
  <text start="930.47" dur="3.69">that it&amp;#39;s happening but it&amp;#39;s feeding</text>
  <text start="932.45" dur="5.45">into their subconscious and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="934.16" dur="6.9">realizing that something is going on</text>
  <text start="937.9" dur="5.77">don&amp;#39;t know exactly what it is yet this</text>
  <text start="941.06" dur="4.95">is the beginning stages more of the</text>
  <text start="943.67" dur="5.43">stages of where he&amp;#39;s calling out the Fed</text>
  <text start="946.01" dur="6.9">will continue on as we move throughout</text>
  <text start="949.1" dur="7.71">the next year or two and we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="952.91" dur="6.41">Trump really point things out that the</text>
  <text start="956.81" dur="5.82">Fed is doing to show that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="959.32" dur="5.53">responsible for what is happening in the</text>
  <text start="962.63" dur="4.14">economy just like when he said listen I</text>
  <text start="964.85" dur="5.01">don&amp;#39;t think this is a good time to raise</text>
  <text start="966.77" dur="5.1">interest rates the debt is coming due</text>
  <text start="969.86" dur="3.63">soon and I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s the right</text>
  <text start="971.87" dur="3.96">time I thought this was going to be a</text>
  <text start="973.49" dur="5.16">free easy money</text>
  <text start="975.83" dur="5.009">Fed Chairman but I guess I was wrong and</text>
  <text start="978.65" dur="4.8">I remember he&amp;#39;s the one who chose him he</text>
  <text start="980.839" dur="3.601">knows exactly what&amp;#39;s going on it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="983.45" dur="4.02">by</text>
  <text start="984.44" dur="4.32">incidents that he said all this and the</text>
  <text start="987.47" dur="2.88">Fed came out and said listen we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="988.76" dur="3.12">continue with what we&amp;#39;re doing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="990.35" dur="4.32">gonna raise interest rates this is all</text>
  <text start="991.88" dur="4.77">part of the plan and this is the</text>
  <text start="994.67" dur="5.16">beginning stages of letting the American</text>
  <text start="996.65" dur="6.12">people know what this is all about but</text>
  <text start="999.83" dur="6.72">this can&amp;#39;t happen yet until we bring</text>
  <text start="1002.77" dur="6.09">others to justice once those people find</text>
  <text start="1006.55" dur="6.3">out what the truth really is</text>
  <text start="1008.86" dur="6.81">they will then believe what Trump has to</text>
  <text start="1012.85" dur="5.76">say about the central bank and this all</text>
  <text start="1015.67" dur="5.84">has to be done in stages and we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="1018.61" dur="5.16">stage one for the central banking system</text>
  <text start="1021.51" dur="4.179">we&amp;#39;re further down the line with</text>
  <text start="1023.77" dur="4.11">everything else but the general</text>

  <text start="1029.56" dur="3.69">shocked and it&amp;#39;s gonna take a little</text>
  <text start="1031.329" dur="4.441">while before everything evens out and we</text>
  <text start="1033.25" dur="4.86">continue on with this plan because</text>
