  <text start="248.97" dur="5.64">remember how the central bankers work</text>
  <text start="251.75" dur="6.52">they use debt as their weapon they use</text>
  <text start="254.61" dur="6.39">debt as control and when countries get</text>
  <text start="258.27" dur="6.08">into debt when corporations get into</text>
  <text start="261" dur="7.29">debt they turn it around and they blame</text>

  <text start="268.29" dur="6.69">corporations look how much debt you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="270.99" dur="6.87">taken on but remember their system was</text>
  <text start="274.98" dur="6.54">developed this way and they make it look</text>
  <text start="277.86" dur="5.16">like these countries they just went</text>
  <text start="281.52" dur="3.63">ahead and they just kept on borrowing</text>
  <text start="283.02" dur="3.81">and borrowing and borrowing and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="285.15" dur="3.63">all in debt actually if you look at most</text>
  <text start="286.83" dur="5.37">of the countries they&amp;#39;re all in debt</text>
  <text start="288.78" dur="6.96">because the central bankers know that</text>
  <text start="292.2" dur="6.3">their free credit card system</text>
  <text start="295.74" dur="4.53">it will cause corruption people will</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="4.35">take funds people will hide funds</text>
  <text start="300.27" dur="5.37">there&amp;#39;s no accountability they know this</text>
  <text start="302.85" dur="6.42">and this is done on purpose</text>
  <text start="305.64" dur="7.5">and now the biz is out there they are</text>
  <text start="309.27" dur="7.95">warning that the entire global system it</text>
  <text start="313.14" dur="6.93">is flooded with debt they&amp;#39;re saying the</text>
  <text start="317.22" dur="6">global debt has now hit 250 trillion and</text>
  <text start="320.07" dur="6.84">it is expected to rise to a record 255</text>
  <text start="323.22" dur="7.29">trillion at the end of 2019 up 12</text>

  <text start="334.89" dur="4.59">each of the seven point seven billion</text>
  <text start="336.78" dur="5.25">people on the planet and it looks like</text>
  <text start="339.48" dur="4.65">there is no slowdown whatsoever actually</text>
  <text start="342.03" dur="6.3">what happens at the end stage the debt</text>
  <text start="344.13" dur="5.97">level increases very very rapidly Bank</text>
  <text start="348.33" dur="3.02">of America right now they&amp;#39;re calculating</text>
  <text start="350.1" dur="3.45">that since the collapse of Lehman</text>
  <text start="351.35" dur="5.08">government debt has increased by thirty</text>
  <text start="353.55" dur="4.88">trillion corporate debt by 25 trillion</text>
  <text start="356.43" dur="5.85">household debt by nine trillion</text>
  <text start="358.43" dur="6.49">financial debt by two trillion think</text>
  <text start="362.28" dur="6.47">about what is happening here think about</text>
  <text start="364.92" dur="7.38">what has happened to the entire world</text>
  <text start="368.75" dur="6.37">the central bank system for these many</text>
  <text start="372.3" dur="6.3">many years they&amp;#39;ve placed each country</text>
  <text start="375.12" dur="6.24">into debt people into debt they made you</text>
  <text start="378.6" dur="5.97">think that debt was good this is how the</text>
  <text start="381.36" dur="5.58">system is run and now at the end stage</text>
  <text start="384.57" dur="4.98">of their system they&amp;#39;re trying to turn</text>
  <text start="386.94" dur="4.23">it around and say we have a problem it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="389.55" dur="3.78">not our problem and I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="391.17" dur="4.92">the central bank it&amp;#39;s the country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="393.33" dur="6.51">problems they put themselves into debt</text>
  <text start="396.09" dur="7.22">and their system is designed to</text>
  <text start="399.84" dur="6.24">purposely put countries into debt and</text>
  <text start="403.31" dur="4.39">this way all blame is off of them</text>
  <text start="406.08" dur="2.97">because what they do is they make</text>
  <text start="407.7" dur="3.18">everyone look at each and every one of</text>
  <text start="409.05" dur="5.73">these countries and say look how much</text>

  <text start="418.41" dur="4.01">these presidents how much debt has been</text>
  <text start="421.5" dur="5.76">accumulated</text>
  <text start="422.42" dur="6.04">well since Obama we&amp;#39;ve accumulated quite</text>
  <text start="427.26" dur="4.03">a bit of debt</text>
  <text start="428.46" dur="4.81">since Trump came on board he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="431.29" dur="5.07">accumulated debt but there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="433.27" dur="5.61">difference Trump the Patriots they are</text>
  <text start="436.36" dur="5.34">not using this debt and pocketing the</text>
  <text start="438.88" dur="6.42">money what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="468.22" dur="5.34">against them using their debt weapon</text>
  <text start="471.16" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;ll be able to run the system into</text>
  <text start="473.56" dur="4.53">the ground this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="475.84" dur="6.45">trying to stop Trump from the very</text>
  <text start="478.09" dur="6.48">beginning this is why Obama and the rest</text>
  <text start="482.29" dur="5.67">said listen you would need a magic wand</text>
  <text start="484.57" dur="6.39">to make the economy look fantastic it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="487.96" dur="4.2">impossible you can&amp;#39;t reach certain GDP</text>

  <text start="507.88" dur="6.39">what the deep state the central banks</text>
  <text start="510.85" dur="6.24">have set up what did they set up they</text>
  <text start="514.27" dur="4.769">made us dependent on the Middle Eastern</text>
  <text start="517.09" dur="4.17">oil it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that we use the</text>
  <text start="519.039" dur="4.711">Middle Eastern oil we&amp;#39;re dependent on it</text>
  <text start="521.26" dur="5.01">through the petro dollar system where</text>

  <text start="526.27" dur="4.29">Reserve debt note to purchase that oil</text>
  <text start="528.55" dur="4.2">then they keep the federal reserve debt</text>
