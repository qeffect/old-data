  <text start="53.36" dur="7.68">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="56.93" dur="7.14">report my name is David 1390 and to date</text>
  <text start="61.04" dur="5.88">is October 1st 2017 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="64.07" dur="4.65">episode is the Cabal pushes propaganda</text>
  <text start="66.92" dur="4.41">that North Korea might attack the</text>
  <text start="68.72" dur="5.85">financial sector let&amp;#39;s get right into</text>
  <text start="71.33" dur="4.71">the economic collapse news now there are</text>
  <text start="74.57" dur="2.909">many different organizations that are</text>
  <text start="76.04" dur="3.57">coming out with different studies and we</text>
  <text start="77.479" dur="4.351">talked about them in previous reports</text>
  <text start="79.61" dur="5.04">where people can&amp;#39;t make ends meet they</text>
  <text start="81.83" dur="6.02">don&amp;#39;t have enough money to survive the</text>
  <text start="84.65" dur="5.85">retail market is imploding on itself</text>
  <text start="87.85" dur="4.21">commercial real estate is going to be a</text>
  <text start="90.5" dur="3.72">disaster because there&amp;#39;s so much open</text>
  <text start="92.06" dur="5.58">space they&amp;#39;re talking about the housing</text>
  <text start="94.22" dur="4.41">market and there are additional studies</text>
  <text start="97.64" dur="4.56">that are coming out from different</text>
  <text start="98.63" dur="6.9">countries around the world and one study</text>
  <text start="102.2" dur="6.69">which is coming out of Australia this</text>
  <text start="105.53" dur="6.65">study shows that 57% of Australia</text>
  <text start="108.89" dur="6.47">mortgage holders they could not handle a</text>
  <text start="112.18" dur="7.27">$100 increase in their loan payment now</text>
  <text start="115.36" dur="6.549">this additional $100 is equivalent to an</text>
  <text start="119.45" dur="5.94">interest rate rise of just point four</text>
  <text start="121.909" dur="4.801">five percent and this is based on the</text>
  <text start="125.39" dur="3.9">national average mortgage of three</text>
  <text start="126.71" dur="6.779">hundred and sixty thousand dollars and</text>
  <text start="129.29" dur="7.53">it&amp;#39;s not just Australia if interest</text>
  <text start="133.489" dur="5.761">rates rise and we saw this back in 2007</text>
  <text start="136.82" dur="5.22">going into 2008 and those people that</text>
  <text start="139.25" dur="5.22">have variable rate mortgages well it</text>
  <text start="142.04" dur="4.08">threw them completely out of whack and</text>
  <text start="144.47" dur="2.03">they couldn&amp;#39;t make their payments</text>
  <text start="146.12" dur="3.78">anymore</text>
  <text start="146.5" dur="4.69">also if the interest rates move up guess</text>
  <text start="149.9" dur="3.42">what those people that are trying to</text>
  <text start="151.19" dur="4.62">purchase homes well they won&amp;#39;t be able</text>
  <text start="153.32" dur="5.22">to purchase so what we are seeing right</text>
  <text start="155.81" dur="5.94">now is that all these studies are coming</text>
  <text start="158.54" dur="5.699">out telling us how bad things are going</text>
  <text start="161.75" dur="4.38">to get now we&amp;#39;ve been looking at this</text>
  <text start="164.239" dur="4.53">for quite a while we know how bad</text>
  <text start="166.13" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re going to get because the central</text>
  <text start="168.769" dur="6.391">bank is needed to keep the interest</text>
  <text start="170.57" dur="8.06">rates so low that no one would really</text>
  <text start="175.16" dur="6.36">realize what was really going on because</text>
  <text start="178.63" dur="4.689">we&amp;#39;re not in a normal market where</text>
  <text start="181.52" dur="4.11">interest rates are allowed to do what</text>
  <text start="183.319" dur="3.361">they normally do and that is move up a</text>
  <text start="185.63" dur="3.57">little bit</text>
  <text start="186.68" dur="4.86">central bankers have been suppressing</text>
  <text start="189.2" dur="7.11">them on purpose because they know if</text>
  <text start="191.54" dur="6.96">they let them go up 2 3 4 5 6 % the</text>
  <text start="196.31" dur="5.73">whole system comes tumbling down and</text>
  <text start="198.5" dur="6.329">this is why we are seeing these studies</text>
  <text start="202.04" dur="4.77">come out that the housing market the</text>
  <text start="204.829" dur="8.121">student loan market the automobile</text>
  <text start="206.81" dur="9.72">market the retail market the commercial</text>
  <text start="212.95" dur="6.429">business market all of this is going to</text>
  <text start="216.53" dur="4.379">be in a huge amount of trouble when</text>
  <text start="219.379" dur="4.411">everything starts to fall apart and you</text>
  <text start="220.909" dur="5.16">know the central banks will lose control</text>
  <text start="223.79" dur="3.479">of the interest rates and it will be a</text>
  <text start="226.069" dur="2.25">complete disaster now we know the</text>
  <text start="227.269" dur="3.12">central banks have been looking at</text>
  <text start="228.319" dur="3.631">inflation and they keep telling us</text>
  <text start="230.389" dur="4.231">there&amp;#39;s no inflation don&amp;#39;t worry about</text>
  <text start="231.95" dur="4.89">it and when we look at this and we look</text>
  <text start="234.62" dur="5.429">at you know wages and everything else we</text>
  <text start="236.84" dur="6.75">realize that wages they&amp;#39;re stagnating</text>
  <text start="240.049" dur="5.461">they&amp;#39;re not moving anywhere and in many</text>
  <text start="243.59" dur="4.259">instances the wages are continually</text>
  <text start="245.51" dur="5.369">declining now when we look at inflation</text>
  <text start="247.849" dur="5.73">and we look at wages we see that these</text>
  <text start="250.879" dur="4.801">two things need to move up together we</text>
  <text start="253.579" dur="4.41">can have inflation while wages are going</text>
  <text start="255.68" dur="5.07">down this is a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="257.989" dur="5.761">disaster and what we&amp;#39;re looking at right</text>
  <text start="260.75" dur="7.349">now is that wages are continually</text>
  <text start="263.75" dur="7.61">declining and inflation is continually</text>
  <text start="268.099" dur="7.44">moving up now this just didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="271.36" dur="7.75">this has been happening for about 45</text>
  <text start="275.539" dur="5.671">years and if we go back in time we can</text>
  <text start="279.11" dur="6.42">see that during this time period in the</text>
  <text start="281.21" dur="6.959">70s the 80s the 90s 2000 wages and</text>
  <text start="285.53" dur="8.22">salaries as a percent of GDP has been</text>
  <text start="288.169" dur="8.49">declining since the late 60s now the</text>
  <text start="293.75" dur="6.81">government does benefit from inflation</text>
  <text start="296.659" dur="7.23">in certain ways incomes pushed higher by</text>
  <text start="300.56" dur="6.15">inflation push wage earners into higher</text>
  <text start="303.889" dur="6.141">tax brackets and their higher incomes</text>
  <text start="306.71" dur="6.329">generate higher taxes and this is why</text>
  <text start="310.03" dur="5.68">they would like to see inflation but if</text>
  <text start="313.039" dur="6.361">wages are declining this is not a very</text>
  <text start="315.71" dur="4.739">good scenario well the private banking</text>
  <text start="319.4" dur="3.659">sector benefit</text>
  <text start="320.449" dur="5.421">from inflation as well the lifeblood of</text>
  <text start="323.059" dur="5.281">banking profits is transaction and</text>
  <text start="325.87" dur="4.689">processing fees from issuing new credit</text>
  <text start="328.34" dur="4.469">since inflation enables households to</text>
  <text start="330.559" dur="6.121">buy more soft credit and service more</text>
  <text start="332.809" dur="6.54">debt banks benefit immensely deflation</text>
  <text start="336.68" dur="5.31">on the other hand is kryptonite to bank</text>
  <text start="339.349" dur="4.171">profits households earning less every</text>
  <text start="341.99" dur="4.56">year are more likely to default on</text>
  <text start="343.52" dur="5.429">existing debt and guess what they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="346.55" dur="4.38">take out new debt so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="348.949" dur="5.46">right now is the central banks they</text>
  <text start="350.93" dur="4.889">don&amp;#39;t know what to do because wages are</text>
  <text start="354.409" dur="3.68">continually declining why are they</text>
  <text start="355.819" dur="4.921">declining because we are losing the</text>
  <text start="358.089" dur="5.771">high-paying jobs we are getting these</text>
  <text start="360.74" dur="5.78">part-time low-paying jobs and wages are</text>
  <text start="363.86" dur="6.389">declining and they&amp;#39;re trying to hold</text>
  <text start="366.52" dur="5.53">inflation down this is the whole reason</text>
  <text start="370.249" dur="3.39">because if they let inflation go up and</text>
  <text start="372.05" dur="3.989">wages are going in the opposite</text>
  <text start="373.639" dur="3.9">direction it would be a complete and</text>
  <text start="376.039" dur="4.47">utter disaster and this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="377.539" dur="4.141">been shipping it off off to other</text>
  <text start="380.509" dur="2.52">countries this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="381.68" dur="2.28">putting into the stock market this is</text>
  <text start="383.029" dur="3.271">why they&amp;#39;ve been putting into the</text>
  <text start="383.96" dur="4.47">housing market they don&amp;#39;t want people to</text>
  <text start="386.3" dur="3.839">notice any of this because think about</text>
  <text start="388.43" dur="4.38">it if they just let all the inflation</text>
  <text start="390.139" dur="5.941">hit the supermarket&amp;#39;s and all of a</text>
  <text start="392.81" dur="8.189">sudden bread was $12 for a loaf and milk</text>
  <text start="396.08" dur="7.079">was say $14 those people who are making</text>
  <text start="400.999" dur="5.16">their money today with one two three</text>
  <text start="403.159" dur="4.98">part-time jobs they wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="406.159" dur="4.111">afford any of this this would be a</text>
  <text start="408.139" dur="3.9">complete disaster on the entire economy</text>
  <text start="410.27" dur="4.379">this is why they&amp;#39;re continually telling</text>
  <text start="412.039" dur="4.71">us that inflation is going nowhere now</text>
  <text start="414.649" dur="4.98">out in Spain we understand the</text>
  <text start="416.749" dur="4.44">referendum is being held today and right</text>
  <text start="419.629" dur="3.51">now the police they&amp;#39;re doing whatever</text>
  <text start="421.189" dur="4.53">they possibly can to stop people from</text>
  <text start="423.139" dur="4.77">voting and they&amp;#39;ve been very nasty to</text>
  <text start="425.719" dur="8.31">the people and we could see right now</text>
  <text start="427.909" dur="9.361">that 62% they are looking to vote and we</text>
  <text start="434.029" dur="6.241">see that there&amp;#39;s about an 83% chance</text>
  <text start="437.27" dur="5.28">that they will vote yes and we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="440.27" dur="4.5">had the final results come in but we can</text>
  <text start="442.55" dur="4.859">see right now they definitely want to be</text>
  <text start="444.77" dur="4.799">separate and apart from Spain and we can</text>
  <text start="447.409" dur="5.19">see that they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen</text>
  <text start="449.569" dur="4.711">and if Catalonia secedes from Spain in</text>
  <text start="452.599" dur="5.461">terms of debt</text>
  <text start="454.28" dur="6.87">ability well it looks like this is going</text>
  <text start="458.06" dur="5.82">to be eurozone debt crisis 2.0 and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="461.15" dur="6.51">going to be in for a very very very</text>
  <text start="463.88" dur="7.32">rough ride and we know for a fact that</text>
  <text start="467.66" dur="6.27">Catalonia this is really the wealth part</text>
  <text start="471.2" dur="4.77">of Spain this is where a lot of the</text>
  <text start="473.93" dur="5.12">taxes are paid and if this splits off</text>
  <text start="475.97" dur="6.63">Spain is going to be in a lot of trouble</text>
  <text start="479.05" dur="6.01">we see out in North Korea things are</text>
  <text start="482.6" dur="3.84">heating up Tillerson right now is saying</text>
  <text start="485.06" dur="3.39">that they have three channels of</text>
  <text start="486.44" dur="4.02">communication open to North Korea and</text>
  <text start="488.45" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;re trying to talk to North Korea</text>
  <text start="490.46" dur="3.24">about North Korea of course doesn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="491.69" dur="2.7">to speak to the United States now Kim</text>
  <text start="493.7" dur="3.75">jong-un</text>
  <text start="494.39" dur="5.43">he is not stupid he understands that the</text>
  <text start="497.45" dur="3.9">deal has to come from both sides now of</text>
  <text start="499.82" dur="2.67">course Trump is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="501.35" dur="4.56">listen don&amp;#39;t waste your time</text>
  <text start="502.49" dur="5.37">Rocketman well he doesn&amp;#39;t want to speak</text>
  <text start="505.91" dur="5.22">and this is a complete waste of time now</text>
  <text start="507.86" dur="5.22">to me this looks like Trump and</text>
  <text start="511.13" dur="5.279">Tillerson they are playing good cop/bad</text>
  <text start="513.08" dur="5.22">cop and it looks like Trump is pandering</text>
  <text start="516.409" dur="4.201">to the corporate media keeping them</text>
  <text start="518.3" dur="3.72">off-guard saying that yes we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="520.61" dur="3.39">to talk to them we don&amp;#39;t want anything</text>
  <text start="522.02" dur="5.069">to do this but we know in the background</text>
  <text start="524" dur="5.339">Trump Tillerson they&amp;#39;ve been speaking to</text>
  <text start="527.089" dur="5.221">G Jinping of China we know that China</text>
  <text start="529.339" dur="5.131">Russia have been talking to Kim jong-un</text>
  <text start="532.31" dur="4.8">we know there are back channels and they</text>
  <text start="534.47" dur="5.49">are speaking to Kim jong-un</text>
  <text start="537.11" dur="5.52">trying to work out some type of deal now</text>
  <text start="539.96" dur="4.29">the deal might not be that North Korea</text>
  <text start="542.63" dur="4.74">get rid of their North nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="544.25" dur="5.25">they might allow North Korea to keep</text>
  <text start="547.37" dur="6.21">their nuclear weapons because they</text>
  <text start="549.5" dur="6.69">understand that North Korea is not going</text>
  <text start="553.58" dur="6.09">to stop until they get what they want</text>
  <text start="556.19" dur="5.31">and that is a nuclear weapon that fits</text>
  <text start="559.67" dur="4.2">on a missile to protect themselves from</text>
  <text start="561.5" dur="4.08">regime change now of course the</text>
  <text start="563.87" dur="3.33">corporate media they&amp;#39;re continually out</text>
  <text start="565.58" dur="3.36">there trying to you know make us all</text>
  <text start="567.2" dur="4.5">believe that North Korea is going to be</text>
  <text start="568.94" dur="4.649">attacking and this is going to be a you</text>
  <text start="571.7" dur="3.24">know a problem here in the United States</text>
  <text start="573.589" dur="3.511">because their missiles will be able to</text>
  <text start="574.94" dur="5.01">hit you know Alaska Chicago I mean</text>
  <text start="577.1" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re just making stuff up here but</text>
  <text start="579.95" dur="4.92">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that North Korea</text>
  <text start="581.66" dur="6.78">they understand that they cannot trust</text>
  <text start="584.87" dur="6.159">the US government because they&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="588.44" dur="5.23">what the government does they understand</text>
  <text start="591.029" dur="5">what the cabal does in the end I mean</text>
  <text start="593.67" dur="4.44">look at what US officials did to Libya</text>
  <text start="596.029" dur="4.511">Qaddafi agreed to give up his nuclear</text>
  <text start="598.11" dur="4.919">weapon program in return for regime</text>
  <text start="600.54" dur="4.77">security that turned to be that turned</text>
  <text start="603.029" dur="4.981">out to be completely stupid this was a</text>
  <text start="605.31" dur="5.31">really stupid move on Qaddafi&amp;#39;s part as</text>
  <text start="608.01" dur="5.4">soon as US officials saw an opening they</text>
  <text start="610.62" dur="6.18">pounce with regime chain change on the</text>
  <text start="613.41" dur="6.75">country today Qaddafi is dead and Libya</text>
  <text start="616.8" dur="5.55">is in perpetual crisis and turmoil look</text>
  <text start="620.16" dur="4.14">at what the US officials are doing in</text>
  <text start="622.35" dur="4.11">Iran they entered into a deal in which</text>
  <text start="624.3" dur="5.33">the u.s. government agreed to lift the</text>
  <text start="626.46" dur="6.27">sanctions on Iran if they agree to this</text>
  <text start="629.63" dur="5.11">nuclear weapons program and after the</text>
  <text start="632.73" dur="3.54">deals reached and Iran had complied US</text>
  <text start="634.74" dur="5.07">officials broke their side of the deal</text>
  <text start="636.27" dur="6.06">by refusing to lift their sanctions on</text>
  <text start="639.81" dur="6.54">Iran they actually placed more sanctions</text>
  <text start="642.33" dur="7.949">on Iran look what they did to said</text>
  <text start="646.35" dur="7.2">Saddam Hussein al in Iraq I mean back</text>
  <text start="650.279" dur="5.25">then Saddam Hussein was the US</text>
  <text start="653.55" dur="3.539">government&amp;#39;s loyal partner and US</text>
  <text start="655.529" dur="4.201">official work worked closely with him</text>
  <text start="657.089" dur="4.741">during the 1980s to kill Iranians but</text>
  <text start="659.73" dur="4.5">when Saddam invaded Kuwait to settle an</text>
  <text start="661.83" dur="6.02">oil-drilling dispute US officials went</text>
  <text start="664.23" dur="9.15">after him with a vengeance and basically</text>
  <text start="667.85" dur="8.109">invaded Iraq with weapons of mass</text>
  <text start="673.38" dur="5.67">destruction which he did not have they</text>
  <text start="675.959" dur="6.211">never found them they didn&amp;#39;t exist look</text>
  <text start="679.05" dur="5.37">at Syria which for at a time served as a</text>

  <text start="815.97" dur="5.84">sit back and let this happen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="819.3" dur="4.86">already seeing reports right now and</text>
  <text start="821.81" dur="6.67">this is coming from the former head of a</text>
  <text start="824.16" dur="7.71">GCHQ says that North Korea is targeting</text>
  <text start="828.48" dur="6.33">the British financial sector to fund its</text>
  <text start="831.87" dur="5.52">nuclear ambitions and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="834.81" dur="5.54">that North Korean hackers they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="837.39" dur="7.83">to hack into the financial sector and</text>
  <text start="840.35" dur="9.01">maybe bring it down or steal as much as</text>
  <text start="845.22" dur="6.75">they possibly can to basically fund</text>
  <text start="849.36" dur="6.03">their operations and we can see that</text>
  <text start="851.97" dur="5.4">this is the propaganda leading into</text>
  <text start="855.39" dur="4.89">what they&amp;#39;re eventually going to do and</text>
  <text start="857.37" dur="4.53">we know from Janet Napolitano and many</text>
  <text start="860.28" dur="4.8">others saying that listen it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="861.9" dur="5.52">matter if if but when the financial</text>
  <text start="865.08" dur="5.19">sector is hit from a cyberattack and</text>
  <text start="867.42" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;ve been using the idea since Sony</text>
  <text start="870.27" dur="3.42">Pictures were hacked by North Korea</text>
  <text start="871.74" dur="3.87">which that never really happened they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="873.69" dur="4.26">gonna be using this propaganda to</text>
  <text start="875.61" dur="4.35">convince the people that North Korea has</text>
  <text start="877.95" dur="3.93">the ability and they&amp;#39;re ready to do this</text>
  <text start="879.96" dur="4.68">and we could see already that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="881.88" dur="5.58">out there trying to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="884.64" dur="6.06">that they are hacking into the financial</text>
  <text start="887.46" dur="6.18">sector in the UK that they have the</text>
  <text start="890.7" dur="5.49">ability to go in and manipulate the</text>
  <text start="893.64" dur="5.46">transactions to steal whatever they need</text>
  <text start="896.19" dur="5.28">and they&amp;#39;re gonna continually blow this</text>
  <text start="899.1" dur="4.08">out of proportion and say that they are</text>
  <text start="901.47" dur="3.39">hitting the United States they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="903.18" dur="4.14">hitting the UK they&amp;#39;re hitting many</text>
  <text start="904.86" dur="7.02">other areas because what they need to do</text>
  <text start="907.32" dur="7.05">is they need to explain away why the</text>
  <text start="911.88" dur="5.55">economy the global economy is failing</text>
  <text start="914.37" dur="5.88">and they need an enemy they need someone</text>
  <text start="917.43" dur="4.92">to blame all of this for and it looks</text>
  <text start="920.25" dur="5.25">like this is what they are building up</text>
  <text start="922.35" dur="5.49">to do and mr. Hannigan said North Korea</text>
  <text start="925.5" dur="7.53">is said to become a premier league</text>

  <text start="933.03" dur="6.93">Britain&amp;#39;s financial sector so right</text>
  <text start="937.47" dur="4.71">there and then we can see already what</text>
  <text start="939.96" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re trying to do and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="942.18" dur="4.77">be pushing this as hard as they possibly</text>
  <text start="943.44" dur="6.27">can to make people believe that if or I</text>
  <text start="946.95" dur="4.17">should say when the system comes down we</text>
  <text start="949.71" dur="3.24">know where it&amp;#39;s coming from because</text>
  <text start="951.12" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re coming up to the point where this</text>

  <text start="971.46" dur="2.82">the opposite direction we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="972.69" dur="3.92">seeing it because they can&amp;#39;t control</text>
