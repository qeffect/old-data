  <text start="122.009" dur="4.741">they have control or somewhat control</text>
  <text start="124.709" dur="5.011">over it and then they add more control</text>
  <text start="126.75" dur="7.2">on top of that since the crypto market</text>
  <text start="129.72" dur="6.51">is decentralized since it is issued not</text>

  <text start="224.58" dur="3.01">Bloomberg put out a very interesting</text>
  <text start="226.959" dur="2.881">story</text>

  <text start="232.989" dur="4.861">years and when we look at this you have</text>
  <text start="236.41" dur="3.68">to scratch your head well what does this</text>
  <text start="237.85" dur="4.83">even mean I mean is this a good thing</text>

  <text start="260.079" dur="5.131">with it I think it&amp;#39;s the opposite I</text>
  <text start="262.87" dur="4.23">think people are not okay with it I</text>

  <text start="327.27" dur="5.23">you can&amp;#39;t tell this by the unemployment</text>
  <text start="330.43" dur="4.17">numbers if you listen to the Fed and you</text>
  <text start="332.5" dur="4.65">listen to the federal government and</text>
  <text start="334.6" dur="6.74">they make it seem like you know everyone</text>
  <text start="337.15" dur="6.42">has a job and what they&amp;#39;re saying no</text>
  <text start="341.34" dur="4.57">everyone doesn&amp;#39;t have a job actually</text>
  <text start="343.57" dur="8.31">what they&amp;#39;re seeing is that there&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="345.91" dur="8.61">a 30.1% surge year over year of job cuts</text>
  <text start="351.88" dur="4.92">and this is the worst they are seeing</text>
  <text start="354.52" dur="5.28">since 2012 now the areas that they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="364.06" dur="6.66">that it&amp;#39;s on the rise now we know that</text>
  <text start="368.29" dur="5.22">this is a problem we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="370.72" dur="5.58">the retail industry they&amp;#39;ve been cutting</text>
  <text start="373.51" dur="5.01">jobs we know corporations they aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="376.3" dur="5.19">getting the revenue the profits that</text>
  <text start="378.52" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;ve been talking about yes they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="381.49" dur="3.6">been putting out their earnings but you</text>
  <text start="383.26" dur="3.36">can manipulate that we know the</text>
  <text start="385.09" dur="4.98">unemployment numbers are completely</text>
  <text start="386.62" dur="4.8">fabricated we know that the restaurant</text>
  <text start="390.07" dur="4.11">Performance Index is continually</text>
  <text start="391.42" dur="5.37">dropping traffic is dropping and we</text>
  <text start="394.18" dur="5.61">already know at this point that the</text>
  <text start="396.79" dur="4.92">holiday season isn&amp;#39;t going the way the</text>
  <text start="399.79" dur="3.39">corporate media is making it seem like</text>
  <text start="401.71" dur="3.27">the federal government&amp;#39;s making it seem</text>
  <text start="403.18" dur="3.96">because they&amp;#39;re telling us how great</text>
  <text start="404.98" dur="4.38">Black Friday was and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="407.14" dur="4.38">actual foot traffic it is dropped</text>
  <text start="409.36" dur="5.79">between 4 and 6 percent compared to last</text>
  <text start="411.52" dur="5.43">year and that means less people are</text>
  <text start="415.15" dur="3.41">going into the stores and purchasing</text>
  <text start="416.95" dur="4.16">plus there are more stores that are</text>
  <text start="418.56" dur="5.92">declaring bankruptcy shutting down and</text>
  <text start="421.11" dur="4.96">of course they&amp;#39;re using online sales to</text>
  <text start="424.48" dur="4.05">show that everyone is out there shopping</text>
  <text start="426.07" dur="5.01">and if you notice that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="428.53" dur="4.68">making a really big deal at this point</text>
  <text start="431.08" dur="4.16">of how great cyber monday was they did a</text>
  <text start="433.21" dur="4.95">little bit but if it was so fantastic</text>
  <text start="435.24" dur="5.74">they would have been all over this now</text>
  <text start="438.16" dur="5.73">what we&amp;#39;re seeing since people are</text>
  <text start="440.98" dur="5.55">losing their jobs they are resorting to</text>
  <text start="443.89" dur="5.64">credit cards and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="446.53" dur="5.61">that consumer credit rose by six point</text>
  <text start="449.53" dur="4.77">five percent year-on-year rising to</text>
  <text start="452.14" dur="2.85">three point eight trillion as of October</text>
  <text start="454.3" dur="3.6">31st</text>
  <text start="454.99" dur="5.79">now this number is more than double the</text>
  <text start="457.9" dur="5.85">rate of increase of the u.s. GDP or wage</text>
  <text start="460.78" dur="5.43">growth making it clear just where</text>
  <text start="463.75" dur="6.389">America&amp;#39;s purchasing power comes from</text>
  <text start="466.21" dur="6.48">now we kinda knew this that those people</text>
  <text start="470.139" dur="5.221">who are out there shopping those people</text>
  <text start="472.69" dur="4.349">who are surviving they&amp;#39;re using credit</text>
  <text start="475.36" dur="3.929">cards because many people don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="477.039" dur="5.211">money in the savings many people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="479.289" dur="5.88">have jobs and you have to resort to</text>
  <text start="482.25" dur="5.199">borrowing money the same thing goes with</text>
  <text start="485.169" dur="6.331">student loans the same thing goes with</text>
  <text start="487.449" dur="7.201">auto loans and the non revolving credit</text>
  <text start="491.5" dur="7.38">it has reached a fresh record of 2.79</text>
  <text start="494.65" dur="8.28">trillion and this is pretty darn bad</text>
  <text start="498.88" dur="7.469">because if we go back in time to 2008 we</text>
  <text start="502.93" dur="7.049">see that credit card debt is around one</text>
  <text start="506.349" dur="7.171">point zero one one trillion at the time</text>
  <text start="509.979" dur="5.94">of the credit bubble back in 2008 it was</text>
  <text start="513.52" dur="6.18">at one point zero two trillion were</text>
  <text start="515.919" dur="6.06">almost back to where we were and if you</text>
  <text start="519.7" dur="4.11">notice we&amp;#39;ve been talking about the</text>
  <text start="521.979" dur="5.1">everything bubble which encompasses all</text>
  <text start="523.81" dur="6.63">these bubbles and when things go south</text>
  <text start="527.079" dur="5.661">all these bubbles are going to pop we</text>
  <text start="530.44" dur="4.8">see that student loans and auto loans</text>
  <text start="532.74" dur="5.469">well it shows that they have hit</text>
  <text start="535.24" dur="6.87">all-time highs auto loans are at one</text>
  <text start="538.209" dur="5.281">point one trillion dollars and we see</text>
  <text start="542.11" dur="4.59">that student loans are at a record of</text>
  <text start="543.49" dur="6.45">one point four eight six trillion I mean</text>
  <text start="546.7" dur="5.43">if we look at this the debt has</text>
  <text start="549.94" dur="5.25">continually gone up because this is the</text>
  <text start="552.13" dur="6.78">product of the central bank&amp;#39;s now</text>
  <text start="555.19" dur="8.04">student loan debt is now as big as the</text>
  <text start="558.91" dur="6.239">u.s. junk market I mean think about this</text>
  <text start="563.23" dur="5.549">and the delinquency rates on student</text>
  <text start="565.149" dur="7.671">loans are continually rising they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="568.779" dur="6.721">much higher than those on auto loans why</text>
  <text start="572.82" dur="6.22">because they&amp;#39;ve told everyone to go back</text>
  <text start="575.5" dur="5.67">to college get an education take out</text>
  <text start="579.04" dur="4.44">student loans and there&amp;#39;d be plenty of</text>
  <text start="581.17" dur="3.6">jobs well what&amp;#39;s happening is a lot of</text>
  <text start="583.48" dur="4.32">people are coming out of college and</text>
  <text start="584.77" dur="3.809">they can&amp;#39;t find the high-paying jobs yes</text>
  <text start="587.8" dur="2.759">they get</text>
  <text start="588.579" dur="3.45">some part-time jobs they live with their</text>
  <text start="590.559" dur="2.97">parents as why more people living with</text>
  <text start="592.029" dur="2.941">their parents and they have a very</text>
  <text start="593.529" dur="4.35">difficult time paying off the student</text>
  <text start="594.97" dur="5.669">loans this is why the government came up</text>
  <text start="597.879" dur="4.08">with the idea okay we&amp;#39;ll take how much</text>
  <text start="600.639" dur="3.24">you&amp;#39;re earning we&amp;#39;ll spread it over a</text>
  <text start="601.959" dur="3.211">certain period of time and we&amp;#39;ll make</text>
  <text start="603.879" dur="3.75">the payments much much lower because</text>
  <text start="605.17" dur="6.06">they realized that these individuals</text>
  <text start="607.629" dur="5.101">cannot pay for the student loans I mean</text>
  <text start="611.23" dur="3.18">look at all these different indicators</text>
  <text start="612.73" dur="5.88">that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about and how</text>
  <text start="614.41" dur="5.7">bad it has gone since 2008 and actually</text>
  <text start="618.61" dur="3.419">if you go back in time it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="620.11" dur="3.74">continually getting getting worse and</text>
  <text start="622.029" dur="3.72">worse and worse as we move forward and</text>
  <text start="623.85" dur="4.089">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at many different</text>
  <text start="625.749" dur="4.291">indicators showing us that this whole</text>
  <text start="627.939" dur="5.57">economy is completely and utterly</text>
  <text start="630.04" dur="6.359">falling apart now Bank of America has</text>
  <text start="633.509" dur="4.93">this indicator they have many different</text>
  <text start="636.399" dur="4.74">indicators and many of them are showing</text>
  <text start="638.439" dur="6.921">that we are headed into a recession a</text>
  <text start="641.139" dur="8.37">bear market and there is one indicator</text>
  <text start="645.36" dur="7.36">which guarantees a bear market it has</text>
  <text start="649.509" dur="7.14">been right 100% of the time it just</text>
  <text start="652.72" dur="7.949">cannot predict the exact time frame but</text>
