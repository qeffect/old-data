  <text start="156.39" dur="4.989">you have an income coming in if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="158.92" dur="4.59">working of course or maybe retired and</text>
  <text start="161.379" dur="2.531">you have a pension but that is income</text>
  <text start="163.51" dur="2.65">coming</text>
  <text start="163.91" dur="7.35">in and you have a certain amount that</text>
  <text start="166.16" dur="8.73">comes in each month if you continually</text>
  <text start="171.26" dur="5.46">add more and more debt what happens well</text>
  <text start="174.89" dur="4.35">in the beginning you&amp;#39;re making this</text>
  <text start="176.72" dur="4.5">income and you have no debt it&amp;#39;s not bad</text>
  <text start="179.24" dur="4.71">I can pay my rent I could pay you know</text>
  <text start="181.22" dur="5.07">my expenses I can go out to dinner I can</text>
  <text start="183.95" dur="4.89">do many different things then you get a</text>
  <text start="186.29" dur="5.07">credit card then you start adding a</text>
  <text start="188.84" dur="4.56">little bit of debt here what happens</text>
  <text start="191.36" dur="3.54">well maybe we won&amp;#39;t go out to dinner</text>
  <text start="193.4" dur="4.14">this time because I have to pay that</text>
  <text start="194.9" dur="6.03">credit card bill because now we have the</text>
  <text start="197.54" dur="5.43">debt plus interest then you add a little</text>
  <text start="200.93" dur="5.43">bit more debt and I remember your income</text>
  <text start="202.97" dur="6.21">is not moving up it&amp;#39;s staying the same</text>
  <text start="206.36" dur="4.56">or if you&amp;#39;re getting cost of living it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="209.18" dur="7.26">moving up by what 2/3</text>
  <text start="210.92" dur="8.04">maybe maybe 5% but not much and as you</text>
  <text start="216.44" dur="5.37">continually add debt what happens to</text>
  <text start="218.96" dur="6.29">your household your household it becomes</text>
  <text start="221.81" dur="5.64">more and more difficult to survive</text>
  <text start="225.25" dur="4.86">because you can&amp;#39;t go out to dinner</text>
  <text start="227.45" dur="7.89">you&amp;#39;re just stuck living in the house</text>
  <text start="230.11" dur="8.26">going to work and paying off debt that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.34" dur="4.74">it and as you keep adding more and more</text>
  <text start="238.37" dur="4.49">debt it gets worse and worse and worse</text>
  <text start="240.08" dur="4.95">this is what&amp;#39;s happening to the world</text>
  <text start="242.86" dur="3.34">now I know a lot of people are saying it</text>
  <text start="245.03" dur="3.3">doesn&amp;#39;t matter you could just keep on</text>
  <text start="246.2" dur="4.53">adding debt now you can&amp;#39;t because</text>
  <text start="248.33" dur="4.89">governments with the tax receipts that</text>
  <text start="250.73" dur="5.689">are coming in from the people they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="253.22" dur="5.76">pay off the debt can they borrow more</text>
  <text start="256.419" dur="4.961">yes this is what the central bankers</text>
  <text start="258.98" dur="6.12">like because that enables them to</text>
  <text start="261.38" dur="7.289">control you now the IIF they broke down</text>
  <text start="265.1" dur="6.62">the debt and this is how it it&amp;#39;s laid</text>
  <text start="268.669" dur="5.731">out household is 60% of GDP</text>
  <text start="271.72" dur="4.78">non-financial corporates 91 percent of</text>
  <text start="274.4" dur="4.86">GDP government eighty seven percent of</text>
  <text start="276.5" dur="7.41">GDP finance corporations eighty-one</text>
  <text start="279.26" dur="7.38">percent of GDP so what we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="283.91" dur="6.24">right now is that the debt level is</text>
  <text start="286.64" dur="7.47">continually growing it&amp;#39;s at an all-time</text>
  <text start="290.15" dur="6.21">high and eventually what happens is the</text>
  <text start="294.11" dur="3.07">system collapses it has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="296.36" dur="2.17">with tariffs</text>
  <text start="297.18" dur="5.34">it has to do with the central bank</text>
  <text start="298.53" dur="6.96">system the system cannot continue on</text>
  <text start="302.52" dur="6.03">this is why the central bankers like</text>
  <text start="305.49" dur="6.15">events but there&amp;#39;s a problem here</text>
  <text start="308.55" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re not getting that plus Trump in</text>
  <text start="311.64" dur="4.53">the Patriots there are we working all</text>
  <text start="313.56" dur="4.89">their deals all their globalists deals</text>
  <text start="316.17" dur="4.89">are being flushed down the toilet and</text>
  <text start="318.45" dur="5.79">Trump in the Patriots they are creating</text>
  <text start="321.06" dur="4.71">new bilateral trade agreements so if we</text>
  <text start="324.24" dur="4.02">start to put this all together what do</text>
  <text start="325.77" dur="6.18">we see happening here we see that the</text>
  <text start="328.26" dur="5.13">central bank&amp;#39;s they are stuck and this</text>
  <text start="331.95" dur="2.73">is why when Trump continually</text>
  <text start="333.39" dur="5.09">contradicts the Fed and said listen</text>
  <text start="334.68" dur="6.14">don&amp;#39;t raise rates anymore lower rates</text>
  <text start="338.48" dur="6.79">don&amp;#39;t tighten anymore</text>
  <text start="340.82" dur="8.08">push stimulus the central bank had two</text>
  <text start="345.27" dur="5.67">choices here one continue on their track</text>
  <text start="348.9" dur="4.41">where they were raising rates and</text>
  <text start="350.94" dur="3.44">tightening the economy would have</text>
  <text start="353.31" dur="3.68">collapsed</text>
  <text start="354.38" dur="5.26">now if the economy would have collapsed</text>
  <text start="356.99" dur="4.27">all eyes would have been on the central</text>
  <text start="359.64" dur="4.53">bank because they&amp;#39;re the ones who</text>
  <text start="361.26" dur="6.45">decided to start to raise rates they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="364.17" dur="5.64">the ones who&amp;#39;s decided to tighten Trump</text>
  <text start="367.71" dur="6.12">would have continually called them out</text>
  <text start="369.81" dur="7.62">on this he did in the beginning the</text>
  <text start="373.83" dur="6.06">Federal Reserve the ECB the IMF the</text>
  <text start="377.43" dur="5.19">Rothschilds they realized listen they</text>
  <text start="379.89" dur="5.34">don&amp;#39;t want to be in the spotlight so for</text>
  <text start="382.62" dur="5.94">now we&amp;#39;re going to reverse everything</text>
  <text start="385.23" dur="7.47">this is where the Fed is now listening</text>
  <text start="388.56" dur="7.19">to Trump they&amp;#39;re following what he is</text>
  <text start="392.7" dur="6.78">saying to do because he deprived them of</text>
  <text start="395.75" dur="6.52">their cover and remember central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="399.48" dur="4.41">they like to be in the shadows but Trump</text>
  <text start="402.27" dur="3.48">conveniently brings them out into the</text>
  <text start="403.89" dur="4.35">light he doesn&amp;#39;t want them in the</text>
  <text start="405.75" dur="5.91">shadows he wants them in the light he</text>
  <text start="408.24" dur="7.32">wants everyone to notice to see to hear</text>
  <text start="411.66" dur="5.94">exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing because once</text>
  <text start="415.56" dur="5.13">they move in a different direction all</text>
  <text start="417.6" dur="5.52">eyes are going to be on them now</text>
  <text start="420.69" dur="4.62">something very interesting christine</text>
  <text start="423.12" dur="7.41">lagarde she&amp;#39;s been the head of the IMF</text>
  <text start="425.31" dur="8.73">and she decided to resign her</text>
  <text start="430.53" dur="5.43">as the head of the IMF later on</text>
  <text start="434.04" dur="5.07">September 12th she tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="435.96" dur="4.98">following today I informed the IMF board</text>
  <text start="439.11" dur="3.5">that I will resign as managing director</text>
  <text start="440.94" dur="4.32">of the International Monetary Fund</text>
  <text start="442.61" dur="5.29">effective September 12th it has been a</text>
  <text start="445.26" dur="5.19">privilege to serve our 189 member</text>
  <text start="447.9" dur="6.03">countries with a devoted staff events of</text>
  <text start="450.45" dur="7.83">this institution now the question is why</text>
  <text start="453.93" dur="9.45">did she resign well because she&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="458.28" dur="8">nominated to be the president of the ECB</text>
  <text start="463.38" dur="5.43">Mario Draghi he&amp;#39;s gonna be stepping down</text>
  <text start="466.28" dur="4.66">supposedly she&amp;#39;s gonna be taking his</text>
  <text start="468.81" dur="5.609">place so what did she do she decided to</text>
  <text start="470.94" dur="6.45">resign because she&amp;#39;s a shoo-in to get</text>
  <text start="474.419" dur="5.551">the job with the ECB so the central</text>
  <text start="477.39" dur="5.1">bankers right now they are changing the</text>
  <text start="479.97" dur="5.55">guard they&amp;#39;re shuffling their players</text>
  <text start="482.49" dur="6.63">around now we need to understand</text>
  <text start="485.52" dur="5.64">something about Christine Lagarde she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="489.12" dur="5.76">has no experience with central banking</text>
  <text start="491.16" dur="5.55">and no formal economic training Lagarde</text>
  <text start="494.88" dur="4.47">received the endorsement of a group of</text>
  <text start="496.71" dur="5.459">European finance ministers last week she</text>
  <text start="499.35" dur="5.1">will now face a vetting session and</text>
  <text start="502.169" dur="6.031">confirmation hearing in the European</text>
  <text start="504.45" dur="5.85">Parliament now Christine Lagarde she had</text>
  <text start="508.2" dur="5.67">problems when she was the finance</text>
  <text start="510.3" dur="8.01">minister in France now Christine Lagarde</text>
  <text start="513.87" dur="6.81">she became the head of the IMF but she</text>
  <text start="518.31" dur="5.039">had to go to trial because she was</text>
  <text start="520.68" dur="5.909">accused of negligent negligence over a</text>
  <text start="523.349" dur="6.301">400 million euro payment to a French</text>
  <text start="526.589" dur="5.431">tycoon while she was the country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="529.65" dur="4.41">finance minister she approved the</text>
  <text start="532.02" dur="5.97">payment from public funds to the</text>
  <text start="534.06" dur="7.16">businessman Bernard Tapie who was a</text>
  <text start="537.99" dur="6.27">friend of then President Nicolas Sarkozy</text>
  <text start="541.22" dur="5.35">this negligence by a person in position</text>
  <text start="544.26" dur="5.28">of public authority constituted a misuse</text>
  <text start="546.57" dur="6.42">of public funds according to prosecutors</text>
  <text start="549.54" dur="8.01">but it looks like she kind of got off</text>
  <text start="552.99" dur="7.95">and these people never go to prison</text>
  <text start="557.55" dur="4.8">these people always seem to be above the</text>
  <text start="560.94" dur="3.42">law and</text>
  <text start="562.35" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve been watching for a very</text>
  <text start="564.36" dur="6.6">long time but we have to understand</text>
  <text start="567.09" dur="6.06">something everything is changing think</text>
  <text start="570.96" dur="4.41">about what is happening out in the UK</text>

  <text start="664.5" dur="4.35">certain event which was going to be war</text>
  <text start="666.3" dur="6.33">that would cover up everything they</text>
  <text start="668.85" dur="6.96">don&amp;#39;t have it at this point they realize</text>

  <text start="675.81" dur="6.09">by raising rates and tightening the</text>
  <text start="679.44" dur="5.1">entire system would fall apart they</text>
  <text start="681.9" dur="5.04">would be to blame that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
