  <text start="298.97" dur="6.09">act that seeks to ensure efficient</text>
  <text start="301.7" dur="6.27">vetting of potential terrorists now this</text>
  <text start="305.06" dur="5.13">bill will require an independent review</text>
  <text start="307.97" dur="5.03">of the operation and administration of</text>
  <text start="310.19" dur="6.99">terrorist screening database the TSD be</text>

  <text start="330.23" dur="4.89">really going to happen are they going to</text>
  <text start="333.26" dur="3.75">explain how people get on and off this</text>

  <text start="337.01" dur="4.92">get on well we&amp;#39;ll have to see and most</text>
  <text start="339.29" dur="3.87">likely no because we notice every time</text>
  <text start="341.93" dur="3.63">they say there&amp;#39;s going to be an</text>
  <text start="343.16" dur="6.69">accountability office looking at all</text>
  <text start="345.56" dur="6.81">these things like the NSA CIA FBI they</text>
  <text start="349.85" dur="6.84">just do everything in secret and they</text>
  <text start="352.37" dur="6.48">don&amp;#39;t tell Congress anything and this is</text>
  <text start="356.69" dur="3.78">what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing in the past now</text>
  <text start="358.85" dur="3.78">we talk about encryption quite a bit and</text>
  <text start="360.47" dur="4.92">we keep on hearing the government and</text>
  <text start="362.63" dur="4.92">the agencies saying that you know we</text>
  <text start="365.39" dur="5.55">can&amp;#39;t stop the terrorists if they have</text>
  <text start="367.55" dur="5.01">if there&amp;#39;s strong encryption we will not</text>
  <text start="370.94" dur="3.99">be able to break through it so we need</text>
  <text start="372.56" dur="4.62">every company to give us access I mean</text>
  <text start="374.93" dur="4.2">France right now is pushing a bill where</text>
  <text start="377.18" dur="5.25">the government will have full access to</text>
  <text start="379.13" dur="7.05">all encrypted devices and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="382.43" dur="5.67">interesting is there is a story out of</text>
  <text start="386.18" dur="5.39">Defense one saying that the Islamic</text>
  <text start="388.1" dur="6.87">state has built a secure messaging app</text>
  <text start="391.57" dur="6.64">with their own encryption and like I</text>
  <text start="394.97" dur="7.02">said before if you are a true criminal</text>
  <text start="398.21" dur="6.3">if you are a true terrace you are not</text>
  <text start="401.99" dur="8.34">going to be making plans using Facebook</text>
  <text start="404.51" dur="7.86">Twitter the internet using your iPhone</text>
  <text start="410.33" dur="4.23">your Android phone to make phone calls</text>
  <text start="412.37" dur="6.15">you&amp;#39;re not going to do that you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="414.56" dur="8.49">to create devices or you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="418.52" dur="7.35">make plans not using devices that the</text>
  <text start="423.05" dur="4.71">government can get to they&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="425.87" dur="2.659">going to do it they&amp;#39;re not going to take</text>
  <text start="427.76" dur="2.629">the chance</text>
  <text start="428.529" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;ll create something on their own</text>
  <text start="430.389" dur="7.23">might be through paper using a cipher</text>
  <text start="433.089" dur="8.55">and we can see right now that the proxy</text>
  <text start="437.619" dur="7.25">army lease the the organization called</text>
  <text start="441.639" dur="7.35">the Islamic state is using a specialized</text>
  <text start="444.869" dur="6.67">encrypted app to communicate with each</text>
  <text start="448.989" dur="6.69">other because as we know the government</text>
  <text start="451.539" dur="6.33">doesn&amp;#39;t want the communication between</text>
  <text start="455.679" dur="4.23">their proxy armies our members to be</text>
  <text start="457.869" dur="5.28">intercepted then be ridiculous because</text>
  <text start="459.909" dur="6.27">they would get information that ah the</text>
  <text start="463.149" dur="5.97">government is behind all this this is</text>
  <text start="466.179" dur="6.26">why they&amp;#39;re using something encrypted</text>
  <text start="469.119" dur="6.54">separate and apart from what the FBI CIA</text>
  <text start="472.439" dur="6.22">France UK and everyone else is talking</text>
  <text start="475.659" dur="5.49">about what the government agencies</text>
  <text start="478.659" dur="6">really want is they want to spy on the</text>
  <text start="481.149" dur="9.42">everyday person that is their main</text>
  <text start="484.659" dur="9.18">objective in all of this and all of us</text>
  <text start="490.569" dur="7.14">need to protect ourselves we need to use</text>
  <text start="493.839" dur="8.57">encryption we need to hide our identity</text>
  <text start="497.709" dur="8.04">we need to make sure that the government</text>
  <text start="502.409" dur="5.47">has a very difficult time spying on each</text>
  <text start="505.749" dur="3.57">one of us would you give them the keys</text>
  <text start="507.879" dur="3.45">to your home no would you give them the</text>
  <text start="509.319" dur="3.57">combination to your safe no there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="511.329" dur="4.02">reason to give the keys to your</text>
  <text start="512.889" dur="4.981">electronic data absolutely no reason</text>
  <text start="515.349" dur="4.44">whatsoever there&amp;#39;s no reason for them to</text>
  <text start="517.87" dur="4.889">track you you can use a product like</text>
  <text start="519.789" dur="4.92">block at pocket calm these are into</text>
  <text start="522.759" dur="3.781">woven sleeves with metal inside that</text>
  <text start="524.709" dur="3.6">blocks the signal you can put a credit</text>
  <text start="526.54" dur="3.839">card in there that has an RFID chip in</text>
  <text start="528.309" dur="4.431">there you can put your real ID in there</text>
  <text start="530.379" dur="4.491">if you have one that has an RFID chip</text>
  <text start="532.74" dur="6.279">you can put your cell phone your iPad</text>
  <text start="534.87" dur="7.389">blocks the signal this is what we need</text>
  <text start="539.019" dur="6.451">to do to say you know something you will</text>
  <text start="542.259" dur="5.49">not violate our rights we are protecting</text>
  <text start="545.47" dur="3.719">ourselves because we do not give you</text>
  <text start="547.749" dur="3.21">permission that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="549.189" dur="3.69">saying now at this point we realized</text>
  <text start="550.959" dur="3.81">that the United States government</text>
  <text start="552.879" dur="5.31">central bankers are trying to provoke</text>
  <text start="554.769" dur="5.55">North Korea and we&amp;#39;re not even sure if</text>
  <text start="558.189" dur="3.541">North Korea actually exploded some type</text>
  <text start="560.319" dur="1.921">of nuclear device which created an</text>
  <text start="561.73" dur="2.76">earthquake</text>
  <text start="562.24" dur="4.44">because we have seen no proof whatsoever</text>
  <text start="564.49" dur="5.31">that they have done this there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="566.68" dur="4.65">radiation from the area and so far they</text>
  <text start="569.8" dur="3.99">haven&amp;#39;t given us any proof whatsoever</text>
  <text start="571.33" dur="4.68">but of course that didn&amp;#39;t stop all the</text>
  <text start="573.79" dur="5.4">different countries that are connected</text>
  <text start="576.01" dur="5.88">to the United States to reinforce that</text>
  <text start="579.19" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;re ready to go to war with North</text>
  <text start="581.89" dur="5.04">Korea and then North Korea came out with</text>
  <text start="584.89" dur="3.389">a video piece of video footage showing</text>
  <text start="586.93" dur="2.82">the submarine fired a ballistic missile</text>
  <text start="588.279" dur="3.031">now we don&amp;#39;t even know if this came from</text>
  <text start="589.75" dur="3.99">North Korea because what we&amp;#39;re finding</text>
  <text start="591.31" dur="6.3">out is that this video was completely</text>
  <text start="593.74" dur="6.539">faked california&amp;#39;s james martin center</text>
  <text start="597.61" dur="4.83">for non-proliferation studies pointed</text>
  <text start="600.279" dur="4.261">out that two frames of the video from</text>
  <text start="602.44" dur="4.26">the film show flames engulfing the</text>
  <text start="604.54" dur="4.02">missile and parts of it falling off</text>
  <text start="606.7" dur="5.85">before the video continues with the</text>
  <text start="608.56" dur="5.7">missile suddenly inexplicably fine not</text>
  <text start="612.55" dur="3.42">only did they alter the failed launch to</text>
  <text start="614.26" dur="3.81">appear like a success but then they</text>
  <text start="615.97" dur="3.57">flipped the recycled footage of other</text>
  <text start="618.07" dur="3.9">missile tests to reclaim several</text>
  <text start="619.54" dur="4.14">successful launches so it looks like</text>
  <text start="621.97" dur="3.929">whoever put this together we don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="623.68" dur="5.46">know if it was North Korea they used old</text>
  <text start="625.899" dur="7.321">footage they spliced and put images</text>
  <text start="629.14" dur="7.199">together to make it look like they&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="633.22" dur="6.3">they actually have some type of missile</text>
  <text start="636.339" dur="5.881">that can carry a nuclear warhead and it</text>
  <text start="639.52" dur="5.879">can be launched from a submarine now</text>
  <text start="642.22" dur="6.66">this is all being pushed and being used</text>
  <text start="645.399" dur="6">for the upcoming war it&amp;#39;s propaganda to</text>
  <text start="648.88" dur="5.209">get all the nations on the same page to</text>
  <text start="651.399" dur="6.121">accept military assets and to be ready</text>
  <text start="654.089" dur="5.44">we see South Korea is continuing with</text>
  <text start="657.52" dur="4.02">provoking North Korea and North Korea</text>
  <text start="659.529" dur="3.661">was flying a drone and South Korea</text>
  <text start="661.54" dur="5.039">sang-woo it came very close to the</text>
  <text start="663.19" dur="7.53">border so they fired a machine gun at it</text>
  <text start="666.579" dur="6.121">they shot warning shots and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="670.72" dur="3.929">making sure that North Korea knows yes</text>
  <text start="672.7" dur="4.62">we are here and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="674.649" dur="6.241">continually provoke you right now the</text>
  <text start="677.32" dur="4.92">Pentagon is very excited because the</text>
  <text start="680.89" dur="5.54">troops were expelled from the</text>
  <text start="682.24" dur="8.13">Philippines back in 1991 and Pentagon</text>
  <text start="686.43" dur="6.88">officials now are very happy because now</text>
  <text start="690.37" dur="5.76">US troops and weapons can be brought</text>
  <text start="693.31" dur="6.87">into the Philippines</text>
  <text start="696.13" dur="6.93">and under this deal the troops cannot</text>
  <text start="700.18" dur="6.93">say they&amp;#39;re permanently but they can be</text>
  <text start="703.06" dur="6.06">rotated in and out and there is no limit</text>
  <text start="707.11" dur="4.89">on the number of troops that can be</text>
  <text start="709.12" dur="4.77">stationed there so they can bring in as</text>

  <text start="735.25" dur="4.68">right now they&amp;#39;re in the heart of winter</text>
  <text start="736.95" dur="5.8">we know that Ukraine is no longer</text>
  <text start="739.93" dur="4.44">purchasing gas from Russia we know they</text>
  <text start="742.75" dur="3.72">filled up their tanks we know they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="744.37" dur="4.17">been trying the reverse flow of the</text>
  <text start="746.47" dur="3.21">natural gas and it looks like they need</text>
  <text start="748.54" dur="4.41">to purchase some more gas because</text>
  <text start="749.68" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re running out as we know the</text>
  <text start="752.95" dur="6.51">United States has been working with</text>
  <text start="754.9" dur="9.3">Ukraine especially DHS FBI to look into</text>
  <text start="759.46" dur="7.71">the malware that was used to hack the</text>
  <text start="764.2" dur="4.56">Ukrainian power plant and the US</text>
  <text start="767.17" dur="5.45">Department of Homeland Security along</text>
  <text start="768.76" dur="8.76">with the FBI has now confirmed that yes</text>
  <text start="772.62" dur="9.1">it was Russia Russia using the black</text>
  <text start="777.52" dur="6.39">energy malware they did it now of course</text>
  <text start="781.72" dur="4.32">as we know when we discussed before that</text>
  <text start="783.91" dur="4.35">this black energy malware was created</text>
  <text start="786.04" dur="5.49">back in 2007 and many many hacking</text>
  <text start="788.26" dur="6.06">groups use this today but what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="791.53" dur="7.44">thinking right now is that this was a</text>
  <text start="794.32" dur="8.19">test this is something they always told</text>
  <text start="798.97" dur="7.19">us about I mean going back to you know</text>
  <text start="802.51" dur="5.85">the cyber Pearl Harbor or the cyber 911</text>
  <text start="806.16" dur="3.55">they&amp;#39;ve been always telling us that</text>
  <text start="808.36" dur="2.76">there can be some type of cyber attack</text>
  <text start="809.71" dur="4.23">they can hit the power infrastructure</text>
  <text start="811.12" dur="5.75">they can bring down the power I believe</text>
  <text start="813.94" dur="6.09">back in 2003 when I was in New York</text>
  <text start="816.87" dur="5.98">working in manhattan we had that power</text>
  <text start="820.03" dur="6.15">outage I believe that was a test to see</text>
  <text start="822.85" dur="6.42">if they can do it and this seems like it</text>
  <text start="826.18" dur="3.93">is another test and I think it has two</text>
  <text start="829.27" dur="3.12">agendas</text>
  <text start="830.11" dur="5.669">associated to it test to see if they can</text>
  <text start="832.39" dur="5.939">use a piece of malware to bring down the</text>
  <text start="835.779" dur="5.731">power infrastructure make sure it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="838.329" dur="5.19">connected to Russia second they need to</text>
  <text start="841.51" dur="4.139">start the offensive in Ukraine and this</text>
  <text start="843.519" dur="6.32">is a great way to kick it off because</text>
  <text start="845.649" dur="6.601">now DHS and FBI has just proven that</text>
  <text start="849.839" dur="4.69">Russia did it now we know this is a</text>
  <text start="852.25" dur="4.89">false flag we know this is a complete</text>
  <text start="854.529" dur="5.701">setup but former US national security</text>

  <text start="860.23" dur="6.27">darkening sky ahead of us he said this</text>
  <text start="863.89" dur="9.21">is another data point of an arc that</text>
  <text start="866.5" dur="9.23">we&amp;#39;ve long predicted so he&amp;#39;s saying yes</text>
  <text start="873.1" dur="7.109">this is what we&amp;#39;ve been telling you that</text>
  <text start="875.73" dur="7.06">Russia China North Korea the Islamic</text>

  <text start="882.79" dur="5.01">infrastructure and bring down the power</text>
  <text start="884.98" dur="6.33">and we are getting very close to that</text>
  <text start="887.8" dur="6.84">situation because we know this economy</text>
  <text start="891.31" dur="6.3">is accelerating it&amp;#39;s falling apart it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="894.64" dur="6.449">looking at the worst that&amp;#39;s ever looked</text>
  <text start="897.61" dur="7.38">it&amp;#39;s actually passed the point of 2008</text>
  <text start="901.089" dur="6.93">and this time around it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="904.99" dur="4.86">be pretty whatsoever now the United</text>
  <text start="908.019" dur="4.741">States they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they can</text>
  <text start="909.85" dur="5.549">to provoke any type of war and the war</text>
  <text start="912.76" dur="4.139">mongers are out there using anything</text>
  <text start="915.399" dur="4.13">they possibly can and we know that there</text>
  <text start="916.899" dur="4.891">are two US navy boats that were</text>
  <text start="919.529" dur="7.571">intercepted by Iran because they were in</text>
  <text start="921.79" dur="8.31">their area and the Iranian officials</text>
  <text start="927.1" dur="7.5">basically released the sailors but think</text>
  <text start="930.1" dur="8.16">about this for a second these two navy</text>
  <text start="934.6" dur="7.799">boats they have GPS they have radar they</text>
  <text start="938.26" dur="7.769">know exactly where they are the strike</text>
  <text start="942.399" dur="6.75">group and the other ships know exactly</text>
  <text start="946.029" dur="6.24">where they are how did they go off</text>
  <text start="949.149" dur="5.25">course I think what they were trying to</text>
  <text start="952.269" dur="4.531">do is sail into this area and they were</text>
  <text start="954.399" dur="3.781">hoping that maybe Iran would fire shots</text>
  <text start="956.8" dur="5.13">at them and this way they could fire</text>
  <text start="958.18" dur="5.67">back or they were on a mission to do</text>
  <text start="961.93" dur="6.659">some type of false flag</text>
  <text start="963.85" dur="9.179">and we can see right now that Iran kept</text>
  <text start="968.589" dur="9.271">their cool they captured the Americans</text>
  <text start="973.029" dur="8.191">and return them now the u.s. apologize</text>
  <text start="977.86" dur="6.649">for this Biden doesn&amp;#39;t want to apologize</text>
  <text start="981.22" dur="8.07">for this but we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="984.509" dur="9.541">that this was really done on purpose to</text>
  <text start="989.29" dur="8.849">try to create some type of an event and</text>
  <text start="994.05" dur="7.089">it didn&amp;#39;t work and we can expect more to</text>

  <text start="1003.69" dur="3.12">coming in a few days we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="1005.55" dur="4.05">to watch that to see if that really</text>
  <text start="1006.81" dur="4.74">happens and they&amp;#39;re pushing this p5 plus</text>
  <text start="1009.6" dur="4.469">one deal forward and we know it&amp;#39;s not</text>

  <text start="1027.6" dur="5.28">targeting forces into Iraq they are now</text>

  <text start="1036.539" dur="7.431">I really don&amp;#39;t believe this basically</text>
  <text start="1040.709" dur="5.911">what they&amp;#39;re there for is to make sure</text>
  <text start="1043.97" dur="5.56">that what happened in Ramadi does not</text>

  <text start="1072.36" dur="5.189">lot of concerns and questions and</text>
  <text start="1074.27" dur="7.08">Cameron finally admitted that the</text>
  <text start="1077.549" dur="10.411">moderate repper moderate rebels overall</text>
  <text start="1081.35" dur="8.43">were actually hardline Islamists so he</text>
  <text start="1087.96" dur="4.5">said some of the opposition forces are</text>
  <text start="1089.78" dur="6.61">Islamist some of them are relatively</text>
  <text start="1092.46" dur="5.31">hardline Islamist and what he&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1096.39" dur="4.8">saying is that the</text>
  <text start="1097.77" dur="6.69">paid mercenaries are terrorists which we</text>
  <text start="1101.19" dur="5.76">support which we tell everyone that</text>
  <text start="1104.46" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re the moderate rebels no there is</text>
  <text start="1106.95" dur="4.07">no such thing as a moderate rebel</text>
  <text start="1108.24" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re all paid mercenaries they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="1111.02" dur="6.25">terrorists so they asked them which</text>
  <text start="1114.21" dur="7.23">groups do these supposedly moderate</text>
  <text start="1117.27" dur="5.94">rebels the 70,000 rebels belong to he</text>
  <text start="1121.44" dur="6.54">will not answer these questions neither</text>
  <text start="1123.21" dur="7.98">will the u.s. because they can&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="1127.98" dur="6.51">you because they&amp;#39;re all terrorists now</text>
  <text start="1131.19" dur="4.68">in the my day of food crisis propaganda</text>
  <text start="1134.49" dur="4.92">and we know a lot of these photos are</text>
  <text start="1135.87" dur="5.7">completely fake and it&amp;#39;s proven that</text>
  <text start="1139.41" dur="5.76">they are fake but here are some</text>
  <text start="1141.57" dur="6.3">questions that should have been asked to</text>
  <text start="1145.17" dur="6.66">whom are the villagers of medea allied</text>
  <text start="1147.87" dur="5.61">if they are indeed anti-assad why are we</text>
  <text start="1151.83" dur="4.05">seeing video footage of pro-assad</text>
  <text start="1153.48" dur="4.5">demonstrations and the citizens chanting</text>
  <text start="1155.88" dur="6.66">the Syrian people and the Syrian army</text>
  <text start="1157.98" dur="7.38">are one hand it makes no sense if it is</text>
  <text start="1162.54" dur="4.92">the essay a Hezbollah and the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1165.36" dur="3.54">government imposing the starvation why</text>
  <text start="1167.46" dur="3.3">then do we see video footage of</text>
  <text start="1168.9" dur="6.27">civilians arguing with terrorists and</text>
  <text start="1170.76" dur="6.24">saying we are hungry not you why if the</text>
  <text start="1175.17" dur="4.68">Syrian government is not allowing a dinh</text>
  <text start="1177" dur="4.56">tomb idea have we been told that the Red</text>
  <text start="1179.85" dur="3.54">Cross UN entered mundeya on the</text>
  <text start="1181.56" dur="9">nineteenth of October with enough food</text>
  <text start="1183.39" dur="9.03">to last two months why was the UN able</text>
  <text start="1190.56" dur="4.65">to enter on the twenty-eighth of</text>
  <text start="1192.42" dur="5.22">December of 2015 and evacuate 126</text>
  <text start="1195.21" dur="7.17">wounded terrorists if the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1197.64" dur="8.42">government is not allowing this the</text>
  <text start="1202.38" dur="6.15">question is everything that the</text>
  <text start="1206.06" dur="5.8">corporate media is putting out and the</text>
  <text start="1208.53" dur="6.72">Western governments but they&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="1211.86" dur="8.37">out doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense as usual it</text>
  <text start="1215.25" dur="6.78">is pure propaganda I mean they told us</text>
  <text start="1220.23" dur="3.87">that the Syrian government was using</text>
  <text start="1222.03" dur="4.11">barrel bombs on its own people the</text>
  <text start="1224.1" dur="6.84">Syrian government was using sarin gas on</text>
  <text start="1226.14" dur="8.54">its own people it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="1230.94" dur="9.24">it wouldn&amp;#39;t make any sense to do this</text>
  <text start="1234.68" dur="7.39">now the other question is the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1240.18" dur="3.51">government is accused of bombing its own</text>
  <text start="1242.07" dur="5.97">people time and time again like I just</text>
  <text start="1243.69" dur="8.49">said then why did the Syrian govern not</text>
  <text start="1248.04" dur="6.69">simply bond Medea but instead allow food</text>
  <text start="1252.18" dur="3.57">into the village and evacuated</text>
  <text start="1254.73" dur="7.44">terrorists as part of the ongoing</text>
  <text start="1255.75" dur="9.96">amnesty deal all of this has been made</text>
  <text start="1262.17" dur="8.4">up to convince you there&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="1265.71" dur="8.49">urgent matter and Assad is hurting his</text>
  <text start="1270.57" dur="6.29">own people and when you look at this you</text>
  <text start="1274.2" dur="5.27">start to realize why they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="1276.86" dur="6.82">because they don&amp;#39;t want to be a part of</text>
  <text start="1279.47" dur="7.03">this peace deal that Russia is trying to</text>
  <text start="1283.68" dur="7.38">put together and you can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1286.5" dur="6.15">using this just like the Yazidis in Iraq</text>
  <text start="1291.06" dur="2.94">where they had to bring in the troops</text>
  <text start="1292.65" dur="5.76">and now you don&amp;#39;t hear anything about</text>
  <text start="1294" dur="6.96">the Yazidis it&amp;#39;s amazing but what</text>
  <text start="1298.41" dur="6.75">they&amp;#39;ve done right now is they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1300.96" dur="6.12">created this case that Assad is not</text>
  <text start="1305.16" dur="4.38">bringing in supplies to his people he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1307.08" dur="5.64">hurting his people and the Syrian rebel</text>
  <text start="1309.54" dur="6.84">group now can say okay we are not taking</text>
  <text start="1312.72" dur="5.7">part in peace talks this month unless</text>
  <text start="1316.38" dur="4.59">humanitarian articles in the latest UN</text>
  <text start="1318.42" dur="4.32">resolution were implemented so you see</text>
  <text start="1320.97" dur="6.96">what they&amp;#39;re doing here they created a</text>
  <text start="1322.74" dur="7.26">situation and now the opposition the</text>
  <text start="1327.93" dur="3.21">rebel group can say we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="1330" dur="3.54">take part of this because look what</text>
  <text start="1331.14" dur="5.31">Assad is doing its own people until he</text>
  <text start="1333.54" dur="4.67">goes along with articles 12 and 13 of</text>
  <text start="1336.45" dur="4.68">the resolution that was passed last year</text>
  <text start="1338.21" dur="5.89">we cannot take part in the peace deal</text>
  <text start="1341.13" dur="10.47">and this is how they&amp;#39;re getting out of</text>
  <text start="1344.1" dur="10.68">it we can see their agenda we can see</text>
  <text start="1351.6" dur="5.87">how they&amp;#39;re making their move and their</text>
  <text start="1354.78" dur="4.71">goal is still the same to remove Assad</text>
  <text start="1357.47" dur="4.39">President Obama was out there saying</text>
  <text start="1359.49" dur="4.58">Russia is losing its influence in Syria</text>
  <text start="1361.86" dur="2.21">and Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1364.09" dur="5.819">even as their economy contracts Russia</text>
  <text start="1367.48" dur="5.91">is pouring resources to prop up Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1369.909" dur="6.12">and Syria States they see slipping away</text>
  <text start="1373.39" dur="4.26">from their orbit Obama said well</text>
  <text start="1376.029" dur="4.851">actually it&amp;#39;s the opposite way remember</text>
  <text start="1377.65" dur="6.36">whatever he says it&amp;#39;s the opposite</text>
  <text start="1380.88" dur="6.37">basically Ukraine is slipping away from</text>
