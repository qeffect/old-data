  <text start="41.81" dur="5.179">economy is doomed helicopter money will</text>
  <text start="43.97" dur="5.7">not work because it was tested in 2008</text>
  <text start="46.989" dur="6.75">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="49.67" dur="7.74">financial news now as we can see Europe</text>
  <text start="53.739" dur="5.831">United States Canada Australia we see</text>
  <text start="57.41" dur="4.41">that the economies of the private one</text>
  <text start="59.57" dur="4.169">central bank countries they&amp;#39;re slipping</text>
  <text start="61.82" dur="4.01">now of course they&amp;#39;re trying to blame</text>
  <text start="63.739" dur="4.701">everything on the brexit as we know and</text>
  <text start="65.83" dur="8.91">this is not going to hold water because</text>
  <text start="68.44" dur="11.62">as we can see in the UK retail sales</text>
  <text start="74.74" dur="9.1">they have fallen and we&amp;#39;ve seen retail</text>
  <text start="80.06" dur="7.71">sales have fallen six months up until</text>
  <text start="83.84" dur="6.87">June so there&amp;#39;s no way that this has to</text>
  <text start="87.77" dur="4.59">do with the brexit and we see that the</text>
  <text start="90.71" dur="4.229">retail sales volumes in the five weeks</text>
  <text start="92.36" dur="5.64">to july second also drop by point nine</text>
  <text start="94.939" dur="6.54">percent this is the largest fall this</text>
  <text start="98" dur="4.619">year clothing stores have reported that</text>
  <text start="101.479" dur="3.78">the sharper sign you&amp;#39;ll drop in</text>
  <text start="102.619" dur="3.96">quarterly sales in 25 years now of</text>
  <text start="105.259" dur="3.21">course they&amp;#39;re blaming some of this on</text>
  <text start="106.579" dur="4.191">the weather and blaming some of this on</text>
  <text start="108.469" dur="5.521">the brexit they&amp;#39;re blaming everything</text>
  <text start="110.77" dur="7.66">except what the economy is truly doing</text>
  <text start="113.99" dur="8.76">and the economy is falling apart we see</text>
  <text start="118.43" dur="7.41">in turkey their credit rating is going</text>
  <text start="122.75" dur="6.21">to be dropped from a B b-plus to a BB</text>
  <text start="125.84" dur="6.75">because of the coup there is an negative</text>
  <text start="128.96" dur="4.92">outlook right now from S&amp;amp;P which we kind</text>
  <text start="132.59" dur="7.02">of expected that this was going to</text>
  <text start="133.88" dur="9.95">happen we also see HSBC they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="139.61" dur="10.8">for a new round of cuts and right now</text>
  <text start="143.83" dur="8.32">they have laid off 87,000 jobs and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="150.41" dur="5.909">still counting because there are more</text>
  <text start="152.15" dur="7.56">layoffs on the way now to pump the</text>
  <text start="156.319" dur="5.941">student loan bubble up even further we</text>
  <text start="159.71" dur="4.92">see that Amazon is getting into the</text>
  <text start="162.26" dur="4.83">student loan market</text>
  <text start="164.63" dur="5.37">and we can see right now that student</text>
  <text start="167.09" dur="7.35">loans they have topped about 1.3</text>
  <text start="170" dur="6.63">trillion and we see that Amazon well</text>
  <text start="174.44" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re getting into the market to blow</text>
  <text start="176.63" dur="6.63">this bubble up even further now they</text>
  <text start="179.54" dur="5.43">partnered with Wells Fargo and what</text>
  <text start="183.26" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="184.97" dur="5.91">offer an interest rate discount to</text>
  <text start="188.06" dur="5.64">select Amazon sharpers and I believe</text>
  <text start="190.88" dur="5.04">these are going to be the prime shoppers</text>
  <text start="193.7" dur="5.07">so they&amp;#39;re going to try to pump this</text>
  <text start="195.92" dur="6.72">bubble up as big as it possibly can get</text>
  <text start="198.77" dur="6.54">because as we know the US government</text>
  <text start="202.64" dur="4.35">central bankers at this point cannot</text>
  <text start="205.31" dur="3.15">come to the rescue when things start to</text>
  <text start="206.99" dur="5.13">fall apart so they need to continually</text>
  <text start="208.46" dur="8.25">pump it up because as we know the</text>
  <text start="212.12" dur="8.52">everyday person who is graduating cannot</text>
  <text start="216.71" dur="5.88">find the work to pay for these loans the</text>
  <text start="220.64" dur="4.65">individuals are strapped with a huge</text>
  <text start="222.59" dur="6.63">amount of debt this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="225.29" dur="6.98">created this program to allow students</text>
  <text start="229.22" dur="5.85">to make payments based on their income</text>
  <text start="232.27" dur="4.36">so if you&amp;#39;re making twenty thousand</text>
  <text start="235.07" dur="3.24">dollars a year or twenty five thousand</text>
  <text start="236.63" dur="3.84">dollars a year or eighteen thousand</text>
  <text start="238.31" dur="5.31">dollars a year and a part-time job they</text>
  <text start="240.47" dur="5.07">will adjust your payments to reflect</text>
  <text start="243.62" dur="4.77">that and if you don&amp;#39;t have a job in many</text>
  <text start="245.54" dur="4.59">cases they won&amp;#39;t even have a payment for</text>
  <text start="248.39" dur="4.68">you because there&amp;#39;s nothing else for</text>
  <text start="250.13" dur="5.34">them to do except make it easier for the</text>
  <text start="253.07" dur="4.68">people who can&amp;#39;t find work and pump up</text>
  <text start="255.47" dur="4.1">the bubble those are there two choices</text>
  <text start="257.75" dur="5.19">now we&amp;#39;re seeing another indicator</text>
  <text start="259.57" dur="7.32">letting us know that this economy is not</text>
  <text start="262.94" dur="8.15">doing well and it comes from the art</text>
  <text start="266.89" dur="7.78">district now art sales they are tumbling</text>
  <text start="271.09" dur="6.24">Christie&amp;#39;s is reporting a 38 38 percent</text>
  <text start="274.67" dur="8.19">plunge in the first half of this year</text>
  <text start="277.33" dur="8.53">we&amp;#39;re also seeing other art dealers like</text>
  <text start="282.86" dur="7.56">Sotheby&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re showing their also</text>
  <text start="285.86" dur="6.9">seeing art sales are down so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="290.42" dur="7.789">seeing right now is this phenomenon</text>
  <text start="292.76" dur="8.459">where the housing in the Hamptons</text>
  <text start="298.209" dur="5.29">those sales are fallen the luxury</text>
  <text start="301.219" dur="4.98">apartments in New York those cells are</text>
  <text start="303.499" dur="5.611">falling San Francisco those sales are</text>
  <text start="306.199" dur="7.19">falling art sales they are falling in</text>
  <text start="309.11" dur="8.819">the retail sector we see sales for goods</text>
  <text start="313.389" dur="7.62">they are fallen it&amp;#39;s contracting we see</text>
  <text start="317.929" dur="6">auto sales which is a little different</text>
  <text start="321.009" dur="5.14">because the manufacturers can</text>
  <text start="323.929" dur="4.2">continually produce cars and when</text>
  <text start="326.149" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re stuffed into the lots of the</text>
  <text start="328.129" dur="3.51">dealership those are counted as sales</text>
  <text start="329.539" dur="5.13">but what we look at how many people are</text>
  <text start="331.639" dur="5.88">actually purchasing cars we see this is</text>
  <text start="334.669" dur="4.35">also declining now the government came</text>
  <text start="337.519" dur="3.69">out with their statistics today saying</text>
  <text start="339.019" dur="4.77">that existing home prices they have hit</text>
  <text start="341.209" dur="6.27">record highs but we see that sales</text>
  <text start="343.789" dur="5.4">growth is slowing now remember these are</text>
  <text start="347.479" dur="3.96">government numbers because when I look</text>
  <text start="349.189" dur="4.2">around the US and they&amp;#39;re taking it from</text>
  <text start="351.439" dur="4.59">certain cities but when we look outside</text>
  <text start="353.389" dur="4.53">of those cities we see the opposite</text>
  <text start="356.029" dur="4.11">happening and there are many reports</text>
  <text start="357.919" dur="3.99">showing that this is exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="360.139" dur="3.601">going on right now but of course the US</text>
  <text start="361.909" dur="5.31">government central bankers they need to</text>
  <text start="363.74" dur="5.489">make it look like everything is going</text>
  <text start="367.219" dur="3.69">very well in the housing market but we</text>
  <text start="369.229" dur="3.03">can see things are rapidly falling apart</text>
  <text start="370.909" dur="3.78">because if everything was going well in</text>
  <text start="372.259" dur="4.77">the housing market they wouldn&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="374.689" dur="5.07">three percent down zero percent down</text>
  <text start="377.029" dur="5.88">zero percent interest rates they</text>
  <text start="379.759" dur="5.37">wouldn&amp;#39;t need all this to pump the</text>
  <text start="382.909" dur="4.141">market up they wouldn&amp;#39;t tell the banks</text>
  <text start="385.129" dur="4.77">to keep the foreclosures off the market</text>
  <text start="387.05" dur="4.349">to pump the prices up they wouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="389.899" dur="4.401">hedge fund investment companies</text>
  <text start="391.399" dur="5.58">receiving free money and purchasing up</text>
  <text start="394.3" dur="4.629">thousands of houses and they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="396.979" dur="3.78">told don&amp;#39;t let them on the market rent</text>
  <text start="398.929" dur="4.41">them if you can if not just hold on to</text>
  <text start="400.759" dur="4.5">them and the reason why this is all</text>
  <text start="403.339" dur="4.8">happening is because the entire system</text>
  <text start="405.259" dur="6.18">is breaking down and it&amp;#39;s declining</text>
  <text start="408.139" dur="5.13">right now we see the philly fed well it</text>
  <text start="411.439" dur="4.29">missed expectations tumbling to six</text>
  <text start="413.269" dur="3.42">months lows and it hit about negative</text>
  <text start="415.729" dur="2.61">two point nine percent they were</text>
  <text start="416.689" dur="5.1">expecting a positive four point five</text>
  <text start="418.339" dur="5.401">percent but that didn&amp;#39;t hit it and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="421.789" dur="4.261">starting to see that things have bounced</text>
  <text start="423.74" dur="6.12">up and guess what they&amp;#39;ve dropped back</text>
  <text start="426.05" dur="5.22">down and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that the</text>
  <text start="429.86" dur="4.34">philly fed Chicago</text>
  <text start="431.27" dur="5.28">fed the Empire manufacturing all of this</text>
  <text start="434.2" dur="4.24">we&amp;#39;re seeing a little bit of a surge and</text>
  <text start="436.55" dur="4.44">then we&amp;#39;re seeing downward trend</text>
  <text start="438.44" dur="4.53">continue the debt that is presented to</text>
  <text start="440.99" dur="3.81">the people from the government the</text>
  <text start="442.97" dur="4.98">nineteen point four trillion has hit</text>
  <text start="444.8" dur="6.09">all-time highs actually since Obama has</text>
  <text start="447.95" dur="5.87">taken office he has added 1.1 trillion</text>
  <text start="450.89" dur="6.63">dollars a year to the national debt and</text>
  <text start="453.82" dur="6.16">as the debt continually climbs and the</text>
  <text start="457.52" dur="4.41">revenue continually falls they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="459.98" dur="3">to have a problem meeting payments it</text>
  <text start="461.93" dur="2.79">doesn&amp;#39;t matter what the interest rates</text>
  <text start="462.98" dur="4.14">are at this point they won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="464.72" dur="5.55">hit the principal payments and that is</text>
  <text start="467.12" dur="5.13">going to be a big big problem now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="470.27" dur="4.31">been tracking the bowl to dry index and</text>
  <text start="472.25" dur="6.12">since the brexit the both dry index</text>
  <text start="474.58" dur="6.4">continually moved up and it hit a high</text>
  <text start="478.37" dur="4.37">of about seven hundred and thirty six or</text>
  <text start="480.98" dur="4.59">seven hundred and thirty seven or so and</text>
  <text start="482.74" dur="4.42">since that point in time we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="485.57" dur="3.33">to see the ball to try index start to</text>
  <text start="487.16" dur="5.79">fall again has fallen another ten points</text>
  <text start="488.9" dur="5.82">we&amp;#39;re down to 726 at this time and as we</text>
  <text start="492.95" dur="4.38">know the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="494.72" dur="4.65">are going to continually manipulate the</text>
  <text start="497.33" dur="4.29">statistical information to convince us</text>
  <text start="499.37" dur="4.98">that everything is fine and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="501.62" dur="5.67">starting to hear from different areas</text>
  <text start="504.35" dur="6.59">financial pundants talking heads that</text>
  <text start="507.29" dur="5.88">there are problems ahead SMP right now</text>
  <text start="510.94" dur="4.99">says there might be a crisis of</text>
  <text start="513.17" dur="5.31">confidence around the globe because</text>
  <text start="515.93" dur="3.69">corporate debt is continually rising</text>
  <text start="518.48" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re going to say it&amp;#39;s going to hit</text>
  <text start="519.62" dur="6.69">75 trillion by 2020 we see corporate</text>
  <text start="522.77" dur="6.15">defaults on the rise and when we look at</text>
  <text start="526.31" dur="5.01">this we need to say ourselves what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="528.92" dur="4.23">going on here because when we look at</text>
  <text start="531.32" dur="3.93">the entire situation we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="533.15" dur="4.8">certain areas where it is completely</text>
  <text start="535.25" dur="5.88">worse than 2008 we see certain areas</text>
  <text start="537.95" dur="5.79">that is approaching what 2008 was like</text>
  <text start="541.13" dur="3.78">and the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="543.74" dur="3.12">are telling us that everything is</text>
  <text start="544.91" dur="4.65">absolutely fine and then we hear from</text>
  <text start="546.86" dur="5.25">S&amp;amp;P we hear from Moody&amp;#39;s we hear from</text>
  <text start="549.56" dur="4.35">other financial pundants that yes there</text>
  <text start="552.11" dur="5.12">might be problems ahead but we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="553.91" dur="6.02">too sure and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="557.23" dur="5.32">they&amp;#39;re preparing for what is coming</text>
  <text start="559.93" dur="4.409">they&amp;#39;re letting everyone know that there</text>
  <text start="562.55" dur="3.56">are problems down the line</text>
  <text start="564.339" dur="3.841">matter what the government says because</text>
  <text start="566.11" dur="3.69">how long can you keep this illusion</text>
  <text start="568.18" dur="3.81">alive because people are starting to</text>
  <text start="569.8" dur="3.899">realize there is something wrong here it</text>
  <text start="571.99" dur="3.36">makes no sense for the stock market to</text>
  <text start="573.699" dur="5.13">be this high with corporate earnings</text>
  <text start="575.35" dur="6.929">down with corporate defaults rising with</text>
  <text start="578.829" dur="7.25">credit where there&amp;#39;s a major problem</text>
  <text start="582.279" dur="9.24">there and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="586.079" dur="8.081">S&amp;amp;P they&amp;#39;re highlighting that the</text>
  <text start="591.519" dur="6.36">monetary policy that was easing thus far</text>
  <text start="594.16" dur="6.27">is contributing to the increased</text>
  <text start="597.879" dur="4.801">financial risk with the growth of</text>
  <text start="600.43" dur="5.37">corporate borrowing far outpacing that</text>
  <text start="602.68" dur="5.43">of the global economy S&amp;amp;P strongly</text>
  <text start="605.8" dur="4.949">suggest that a correction in the global</text>
  <text start="608.11" dur="5.219">credit markets is unavoidable in fact</text>
  <text start="610.749" dur="6.361">they&amp;#39;re saying they believe the credit</text>
  <text start="613.329" dur="6">correction began in late 2015 and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="617.11" dur="8.57">going to accelerate throughout this year</text>
  <text start="619.329" dur="8.581">and get much worse and SNP right now are</text>
  <text start="625.68" dur="4.569">saying that the global central banks are</text>
  <text start="627.91" dur="4.289">now trapped nay no longer wish to push</text>
  <text start="630.249" dur="4.02">rates lower on one hand but on the other</text>
  <text start="632.199" dur="5.661">hand any sharp spike in rates would</text>
  <text start="634.269" dur="7.17">wreak havoc on the global credit markets</text>
  <text start="637.86" dur="6.699">so right now we can see that the central</text>
  <text start="641.439" dur="5.88">bankers they&amp;#39;re looking for different</text>
  <text start="644.559" dur="6">ways to keep the system alive before</text>
  <text start="647.319" dur="5.041">they collapse it that&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="650.559" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re doing right now because they</text>
  <text start="652.36" dur="4.68">know they can&amp;#39;t keep this going forever</text>
  <text start="653.649" dur="5.49">it&amp;#39;s completely impossible people think</text>
  <text start="657.04" dur="4.5">they can people think well they just can</text>
  <text start="659.139" dur="4.38">keep creating money out of thin air they</text>
  <text start="661.54" dur="4.169">can keep increasing the debt of all</text>
  <text start="663.519" dur="5.16">these countries eventually what happens</text>
  <text start="665.709" dur="4.711">is the countries don&amp;#39;t have the revenue</text>
  <text start="668.679" dur="3.991">to pay for the debt no matter what the</text>
  <text start="670.42" dur="4.2">interest rates are and we&amp;#39;re reaching</text>
  <text start="672.67" dur="3.719">that point where it&amp;#39;s getting harder and</text>
  <text start="674.62" dur="3.209">harder because think about if we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="676.389" dur="5.101">zero percent interest rates right now</text>
  <text start="677.829" dur="5.281">and some countries at- we know at this</text>
  <text start="681.49" dur="4.17">point as more and more people lose their</text>
  <text start="683.11" dur="5.279">jobs and as the debt continually Rises</text>
  <text start="685.66" dur="5.46">like we said 1.1 trillion just in the US</text>
  <text start="688.389" dur="6.721">every year it&amp;#39;s getting harder and</text>
  <text start="691.12" dur="6.32">harder to meet their obligations now</text>
  <text start="695.11" dur="5.71">they&amp;#39;re talking about helicopter money</text>
  <text start="697.44" dur="6.81">and we&amp;#39;ve talked about this before and</text>
  <text start="700.82" dur="7.42">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that they</text>
  <text start="704.25" dur="7.94">have already tried helicopter money they</text>
  <text start="708.24" dur="10.62">tried it back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="712.19" dur="10.36">think about what happened in 2008 Bush</text>
  <text start="718.86" dur="6.54">the the Bush administration supported</text>
  <text start="722.55" dur="9.23">enthusiastically by Congress the Federal</text>
  <text start="725.4" dur="10.77">Reserve engaged in a tax rebate scheme</text>
  <text start="731.78" dur="6.58">during the first half of 2008 the</text>
  <text start="736.17" dur="6.21">government essentially paid people for</text>
  <text start="738.36" dur="8.82">being people and they distributed this</text>
  <text start="742.38" dur="7.04">money through tax credits so when we</text>
  <text start="747.18" dur="8.07">look at this back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="749.42" dur="13.57">we see what happened in the spring of</text>
  <text start="755.25" dur="11.85">2008 they did the following those single</text>
  <text start="762.99" dur="8.07">filers won&amp;#39;t guess what they found six</text>
  <text start="767.1" dur="6.93">hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars</text>
  <text start="771.06" dur="5.19">was received for married couples and 300</text>
  <text start="774.03" dur="6.63">for any children and they received it in</text>
  <text start="776.25" dur="7.17">their bank accounts so back then they</text>
  <text start="780.66" dur="5.04">actually gave money to the people they</text>
  <text start="783.42" dur="7.1">felt people were gonna go back out and</text>
  <text start="785.7" dur="7.88">spend that money like crazy guess what</text>
  <text start="790.52" dur="7.03">it didn&amp;#39;t happen now they did this</text>
  <text start="793.58" dur="8.31">because they were hoping to continue the</text>
  <text start="797.55" dur="7.74">economy moving along but it didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="801.89" dur="8.86">because the theory sounds great in a</text>
  <text start="805.29" dur="8.37">vacuum in a closed classroom but when</text>
  <text start="810.75" dur="4.92">you put it out in the real world where</text>
  <text start="813.66" dur="4.26">people aren&amp;#39;t making money they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="815.67" dur="6.75">have money and this is all they have</text>
  <text start="817.92" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re not running out to spend it now</text>
  <text start="822.42" dur="3.66">think about when they did this back in</text>
  <text start="823.8" dur="4.38">two thousand eight the economy was</text>
  <text start="826.08" dur="3.21">already crashing housing was already</text>
  <text start="828.18" dur="2.7">crashing even though they were telling</text>
  <text start="829.29" dur="3.21">us everything was fine that they were</text>
  <text start="830.88" dur="5.16">forecasting any type of recession during</text>
  <text start="832.5" dur="6.21">the year we have the recession they</text>
  <text start="836.04" dur="4.14">really thought people if they had six</text>
  <text start="838.71" dur="3.24">hundred dollars or twelve hundred</text>
  <text start="840.18" dur="3.81">dollars they were going to run out and</text>
  <text start="841.95" dur="4.95">buy a new TV they&amp;#39;re going to buy out</text>
  <text start="843.99" dur="5.25">and go out and buy goods but it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="846.9" dur="4.74">happen the same thing is going to happen</text>
  <text start="849.24" dur="4.59">right now people are getting by day to</text>
  <text start="851.64" dur="4.17">day they know what their finances are</text>
  <text start="853.83" dur="5.28">they know what they can afford and if</text>
  <text start="855.81" dur="7.05">they do receive five hundred a thousand</text>
  <text start="859.11" dur="6.47">dollars they&amp;#39;re going to keep it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="862.86" dur="5.63">going to use it for what they need</text>
  <text start="865.58" dur="6.16">they&amp;#39;re not going to go out and purchase</text>
  <text start="868.49" dur="7.99">like the central bankers think they</text>
  <text start="871.74" dur="8.7">should and this whole thing is going to</text>
  <text start="876.48" dur="7.44">fail once again so when we look at this</text>
  <text start="880.44" dur="7.05">we see that the economy is completely</text>
  <text start="883.92" dur="6.69">doomed the central bankers all they have</text>
  <text start="887.49" dur="5.82">left is creating currency out of thin</text>
  <text start="890.61" dur="5.04">air they can manipulate the statistics</text>
  <text start="893.31" dur="3.9">they can manipulate everything but they</text>
  <text start="895.65" dur="3.84">can manipulate it so far because when</text>
  <text start="897.21" dur="4.92">everyone is out of work when the</text>
  <text start="899.49" dur="4.71">economies are reeling when the countries</text>
  <text start="902.13" dur="3.15">are so far into debt that they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="904.2" dur="4.29">make the payment and they have to</text>
  <text start="905.28" dur="5.52">continually take out more loans or</text>
  <text start="908.49" dur="4.71">create more currency depending on what</text>
  <text start="910.8" dur="5.63">country and you can see right there and</text>
  <text start="913.2" dur="5.46">then the system has come to an end and</text>
  <text start="916.43" dur="4">more and more people will be waking up</text>
  <text start="918.66" dur="4.74">more me more and more people will</text>
  <text start="920.43" dur="6.51">realize that the statistical information</text>
  <text start="923.4" dur="6.38">is completely wrong and this is when the</text>
  <text start="926.94" dur="6.24">confidence for the central bankers</text>
  <text start="929.78" dur="5.59">starts to fade away and this is what</text>
  <text start="933.18" dur="6.57">they&amp;#39;re trying to avoid what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="935.37" dur="6.48">trying to do right now is quickly create</text>
  <text start="939.75" dur="5.28">something where they can blame it on</text>
  <text start="941.85" dur="6.36">another group or country so they are not</text>
  <text start="945.03" dur="5.52">blamed remember their entire agenda is</text>
  <text start="948.21" dur="7.22">to restart the system to reduce the</text>
  <text start="950.55" dur="6.87">population to enslave people once again</text>
  <text start="955.43" dur="4.06">listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
  <text start="957.42" dur="5.66">listening be well be safe and especially</text>
  <text start="959.49" dur="3.59">be prepared thanks a lot</text>
