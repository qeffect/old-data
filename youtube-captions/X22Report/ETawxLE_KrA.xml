  <text start="59.28" dur="4.29">database or something and they said they</text>
  <text start="61.05" dur="5.01">fixed it and we should be okay now and</text>

  <text start="72.24" dur="4.199">intermittent going on throughout the</text>
  <text start="73.89" dur="5.79">whole day let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="76.439" dur="5.551">collapse news and we understand out in</text>
  <text start="79.68" dur="5.189">Europe they are teetering on a</text>
  <text start="81.99" dur="4.62">depression of course all the officials</text>
  <text start="84.869" dur="3.36">out there the government officials the</text>
  <text start="86.61" dur="5.21">eurozone officials are telling us they</text>
  <text start="88.229" dur="6.811">are in a recovery and everything is fine</text>
  <text start="91.82" dur="6.22">but if we look at the unemployment the</text>
  <text start="95.04" dur="5.039">unemployment is horrific Spain&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="98.04" dur="6.6">unemployment rate stayed above</text>
  <text start="100.079" dur="9.241">twenty-five percent in 2013 that stayed</text>
  <text start="104.64" dur="8.189">there for six quarters in a row there is</text>
  <text start="109.32" dur="5.549">a problem it is not getting better and</text>
  <text start="112.829" dur="5.101">if you look further the youth</text>
  <text start="114.869" dur="6.721">unemployment is near fifty-eight percent</text>
  <text start="117.93" dur="6.929">in Spain more than half of the youth in</text>
  <text start="121.59" dur="6.059">Spain are out of work this problem</text>
  <text start="124.859" dur="5.131">cannot get better with all of these</text>
  <text start="127.649" dur="4.891">people out of work the only way to make</text>
  <text start="129.99" dur="4.53">it better is to all of a sudden open up</text>
  <text start="132.54" dur="4.14">tons of jobs and have everyone go and</text>
  <text start="134.52" dur="4.98">make a good living and you know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="136.68" dur="3.66">not going to happen it just doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="139.5" dur="4.709">that way</text>
  <text start="140.34" dur="7.08">and as we know in Spain in Greece and</text>
  <text start="144.209" dur="6.151">also in Italy the bad loans are hitting</text>
  <text start="147.42" dur="5.94">record highs and we&amp;#39;re looking that</text>
  <text start="150.36" dur="6.87">Italy right now they&amp;#39;re bad loans have</text>
  <text start="153.36" dur="6.03">hit record highs of 23% and the Italian</text>
  <text start="157.23" dur="3.539">yield at almost seven year lows it is</text>
  <text start="159.39" dur="3.569">perhaps surprising to some that the</text>
  <text start="160.769" dur="5.641">Italian bad loan rates are at their</text>
  <text start="162.959" dur="6.75">highest on record bank clients with bad</text>
  <text start="166.41" dur="7.29">loans have more than doubled since 2008</text>
  <text start="169.709" dur="6.06">things are getting really bad in Europe</text>
  <text start="173.7" dur="3.95">and it&amp;#39;s happening here in the United</text>
  <text start="175.769" dur="5.821">States I mean yesterday reported on a</text>
  <text start="177.65" dur="5.8">wall street exec figured out the</text>
  <text start="181.59" dur="3.3">unemployment and he was saying no the</text>
  <text start="183.45" dur="4.2">real employment is around thirty seven</text>
  <text start="184.89" dur="3.87">percent i&amp;#39;m looking at shadow stats he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="187.65" dur="3.059">saying it&amp;#39;s around twenty five percent</text>
  <text start="188.76" dur="4.53">and then someone else did a calculation</text>
  <text start="190.709" dur="5.851">it&amp;#39;s around thirty percent of course the</text>
  <text start="193.29" dur="5.64">government and the federal employment is</text>
  <text start="196.56" dur="4.17">six point seven percent because of</text>
  <text start="198.93" dur="5.07">course they changed all the calculations</text>
  <text start="200.73" dur="5.759">and they need to do this to make make it</text>
  <text start="204" dur="4.889">look like things are ok they need to</text>
  <text start="206.489" dur="5.851">keep the illusion that the market is</text>
  <text start="208.889" dur="7.171">okay the economy is okay and they need</text>
  <text start="212.34" dur="5.759">to do this until the very last second so</text>
  <text start="216.06" dur="4.56">we understand that all the private</text>
  <text start="218.099" dur="4.591">western central banks are in trouble and</text>
  <text start="220.62" dur="3.63">what do they do they go out and they tax</text>
  <text start="222.69" dur="3.449">the people because they can&amp;#39;t find the</text>
  <text start="224.25" dur="3.75">revenue any other place to pay the high</text>
  <text start="226.139" dur="4.021">interest on the debt they keep the</text>
  <text start="228" dur="4.709">interest rates very low they keep the</text>
  <text start="230.16" dur="4.38">gold suppressed and they keep smacking</text>
  <text start="232.709" dur="3.601">it down so no one you know will look at</text>
  <text start="234.54" dur="3.479">it and say hey why is gold rising is</text>
  <text start="236.31" dur="5.1">there a problem and they keep the</text>
  <text start="238.019" dur="6.06">markets up high and right now just like</text>
  <text start="241.41" dur="5.189">every single other country they have</text>
  <text start="244.079" dur="5.041">created the beylin documents all</text>
  <text start="246.599" dur="5.191">throughout the eurozone in Switzerland</text>
  <text start="249.12" dur="5.399">in Australia in Canada in England and in</text>
  <text start="251.79" dur="5.699">the United States and right now Japan</text>
  <text start="254.519" dur="6.931">says listen we are strapped for money</text>
  <text start="257.489" dur="7.68">for cash we need to go find some more so</text>
  <text start="261.45" dur="7.5">Japan is planning to raid dormant bank</text>
  <text start="265.169" dur="6.87">accounts to raise new revenue the ruling</text>
  <text start="268.95" dur="5.1">Liberal Democratic Party is planning to</text>
  <text start="272.039" dur="3.87">submit a bill to allow the government to</text>
  <text start="274.05" dur="4.98">access bank accounts that have not been</text>
  <text start="275.909" dur="6.26">touched for over 10 years or more</text>
  <text start="279.03" dur="7.41">accounts holding some 85 billion yen are</text>
  <text start="282.169" dur="7.271">classified at door as dormant each year</text>
  <text start="286.44" dur="4.439">and again the plan is for the funds from</text>
  <text start="289.44" dur="3.75">the dormant accounts to be transferred</text>
  <text start="290.879" dur="5.76">to the government-run deposit insurance</text>
  <text start="293.19" dur="5.67">corporation of japan so we can see what</text>
  <text start="296.639" dur="6.361">they&amp;#39;re doing right now they are getting</text>
  <text start="298.86" dur="6.63">ready to raid the people&amp;#39;s money in the</text>
  <text start="303" dur="6.09">banks and we will probably see this</text>
  <text start="305.49" dur="5.28">spread all across the eurozone and into</text>
  <text start="309.09" dur="3.75">the United States because this is what</text>
  <text start="310.77" dur="4.889">happens when governments become</text>
  <text start="312.84" dur="5.759">desperate they end up rating the Social</text>
  <text start="315.659" dur="4.38">Security tills just like Spain is doing</text>
  <text start="318.599" dur="3.6">right now and the United States already</text>
  <text start="320.039" dur="4.59">did it and they replace it you know with</text>
  <text start="322.199" dur="3.75">Treasury bonds or you know some i&amp;#39;ll use</text>
  <text start="324.629" dur="3.66">that they stick there and say oh yeah</text>
  <text start="325.949" dur="5.611">well we owe you this later later on and</text>
  <text start="328.289" dur="5.22">we can see how this happens and it just</text>
  <text start="331.56" dur="4.259">continually going on and on and on</text>
  <text start="333.509" dur="6.481">because these governments cannot sustain</text>
  <text start="335.819" dur="6.84">the debt they cannot pay and they cannot</text>
  <text start="339.99" dur="4.859">get the revenue to pay the interest on</text>
  <text start="342.659" dur="5.551">the debt and to keep all the programs</text>
  <text start="344.849" dur="5.31">going in the country so they resort to</text>
  <text start="348.21" dur="7.079">other methods and this is one of them</text>
  <text start="350.159" dur="8.611">tax taxes are another now I understand</text>
  <text start="355.289" dur="6.331">that the US the Fed they are eventually</text>
  <text start="358.77" dur="4.619">going to come out and tell us that the</text>
  <text start="361.62" dur="3.75">unemployment rate has gone down again</text>
  <text start="363.389" dur="6.361">because you know all those people that</text>
  <text start="365.37" dur="7.71">were getting the unemployment extension</text>
  <text start="369.75" dur="7.319">benefits that ran out in December so you</text>
  <text start="373.08" dur="6.149">have a 1.3 million people who are not</text>
  <text start="377.069" dur="4.051">going to get unemployment and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="379.229" dur="3.78">going to fall off and they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="381.12" dur="4.079">to be counted anymore and as we go</text>
  <text start="383.009" dur="3.511">throughout this whole entire year more</text>
  <text start="385.199" dur="3.62">and more people are going to fall off</text>
  <text start="386.52" dur="5.009">and they will not be counted and the</text>
  <text start="388.819" dur="4.871">unemployment rate will continually come</text>
  <text start="391.529" dur="4.471">down but when you really look to see</text>
  <text start="393.69" dur="3.9">what is happening out there we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="396" dur="3.479">companies are laying off yesterday I</text>
  <text start="397.59" dur="4.62">said Intel&amp;#39;s laying about 5,000 people</text>

  <text start="402.21" dur="5.55">off 1100 people target you know they</text>
  <text start="406.409" dur="4.861">decided to cut for</text>

  <text start="437.34" dur="4.5">is it like six months or whatever they</text>
  <text start="438.81" dur="4.65">get us a certain amount of money they</text>
  <text start="441.84" dur="3.6">will eventually fall off because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="443.46" dur="4.08">no extension and the unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="445.44" dur="5.04">will come down it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="447.54" dur="5.34">whatsoever the way they calculate</text>
  <text start="450.48" dur="4.38">unemployment really if you really think</text>
  <text start="452.88" dur="3.78">about it all these layoffs and</text>

  <text start="458.97" dur="7.59">laid off and unemployment is continually</text>
  <text start="462.21" dur="6.6">coming down now we understand all across</text>
  <text start="466.56" dur="4.74">the nation and that we have a</text>
  <text start="468.81" dur="3.96">constitutional free zone which wraps</text>
  <text start="471.3" dur="3.63">around the country it&amp;#39;s a hundred miles</text>
  <text start="472.77" dur="4.83">in from any nation other nation in the</text>
  <text start="474.93" dur="4.74">United States or from the ocean and we</text>
  <text start="477.6" dur="4.5">can see that our rights are being</text>
  <text start="479.67" dur="4.44">chipped away and they&amp;#39;re taking trying</text>
  <text start="482.1" dur="9.36">to take away a lot of our rights and</text>
  <text start="484.11" dur="10.8">right now college campuses have no free</text>
  <text start="491.46" dur="5.91">speech zones a majority of the u.s.</text>
  <text start="494.91" dur="4.68">institutions of higher learning enforce</text>
  <text start="497.37" dur="5.37">rules that severely restrict free speech</text>
  <text start="499.59" dur="4.05">on campus now I remember that College</text>
  <text start="502.74" dur="4.02">was supposed to be a place of</text>
  <text start="503.64" dur="5.79">free-thinking you speak your mind you</text>
  <text start="506.76" dur="5.13">allow to have protests to show you know</text>
  <text start="509.43" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re always it was a way of thinking</text>
  <text start="511.89" dur="4.709">and it seems like colleges are no longer</text>
  <text start="514.53" dur="4.53">like that they don&amp;#39;t want you to have</text>
  <text start="516.599" dur="4.411">the freedom to speak your mind to think</text>
  <text start="519.06" dur="4.56">to say you know what I don&amp;#39;t agree with</text>
  <text start="521.01" dur="4.38">the government and right now fifty nine</text>
  <text start="523.62" dur="3.93">percent of u.s. colleges and</text>
  <text start="525.39" dur="4.43">universities received a red light</text>
  <text start="527.55" dur="5.31">meaning that schools and doors policies</text>
  <text start="529.82" dur="5.8">that the watchdog group says impede on</text>
  <text start="532.86" dur="5.49">first amendment rights out of the 427</text>
  <text start="535.62" dur="5.1">schools surveyed in the report about one</text>
  <text start="538.35" dur="5.76">out of every six and forced</text>
  <text start="540.72" dur="6.27">free speech zones hey the United States</text>
  <text start="544.11" dur="4.89">government also has free speech zones</text>
  <text start="546.99" dur="3.87">you just can&amp;#39;t go out there and speak</text>
  <text start="549" dur="3.389">your mind because there are certain</text>
  <text start="550.86" dur="3">areas where you&amp;#39;re allowed to do it in</text>
  <text start="552.389" dur="4.711">other places you can there&amp;#39;s also a law</text>
  <text start="553.86" dur="4.829">that says you can&amp;#39;t protest if there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="557.1" dur="4.529">government official within like a</text>
  <text start="558.689" dur="4.351">hundred feet of you or so and even if</text>
  <text start="561.629" dur="3.75">you don&amp;#39;t know that they&amp;#39;re there you</text>
  <text start="563.04" dur="4.859">stoop you still can&amp;#39;t protest in that</text>
  <text start="565.379" dur="6.121">area so you can see what is happening</text>
  <text start="567.899" dur="7.05">today in America they are trying to</text>
  <text start="571.5" dur="8.129">remove the Constitution this is their</text>
  <text start="574.949" dur="6.961">plan now we understand Obamacare or the</text>
  <text start="579.629" dur="6.091">Affordable Care Act was really designed</text>
  <text start="581.91" dur="6.15">to bring in tax revenue it was really</text>
  <text start="585.72" dur="4.409">designed to bring in revenue for the</text>
  <text start="588.06" dur="5.04">insurance companies it was not designed</text>
  <text start="590.129" dur="4.65">to help the people and everyone you know</text>
  <text start="593.1" dur="3.779">and beginning everyone&amp;#39;s like Oh rah rah</text>
  <text start="594.779" dur="3.631">let&amp;#39;s go health insurance and you know</text>
  <text start="596.879" dur="4.531">we&amp;#39;ll get all those uninsured people</text>
  <text start="598.41" dur="5.25">insured now but I hate to say it most of</text>
  <text start="601.41" dur="4.89">the people who are uninsured the reason</text>
  <text start="603.66" dur="4.95">for it is it it&amp;#39;s too expensive you just</text>
  <text start="606.3" dur="4.709">can&amp;#39;t afford it and when you get the</text>
  <text start="608.61" dur="4.349">cheaper policies you&amp;#39;re paying at you</text>
  <text start="611.009" dur="4.14">know a two three hundred dollar premiums</text>
  <text start="612.959" dur="3.75">I think that&amp;#39;s for one person plus you</text>
  <text start="615.149" dur="3.42">have to take a high deductible so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="616.709" dur="3.24">still coming out of your pocket and I</text>
  <text start="618.569" dur="3.63">don&amp;#39;t think these government officials</text>
  <text start="619.949" dur="4.74">realize that was the real problem here</text>
  <text start="622.199" dur="4.711">it wasn&amp;#39;t that nobody wanted it they</text>
  <text start="624.689" dur="4.38">couldn&amp;#39;t afford it and now with the</text>
  <text start="626.91" dur="4.109">Affordable Care Act it really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="629.069" dur="3.45">make it cheaper for people it make it</text>
  <text start="631.019" dur="4.5">made it actually worse than what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="632.519" dur="5.911">happening now is that each company is</text>
  <text start="635.519" dur="5.07">saying guess what I know you work here</text>
  <text start="638.43" dur="4.589">and we&amp;#39;ve been ensuring your spouse or</text>
  <text start="640.589" dur="5.97">your work here in your part time but</text>
  <text start="643.019" dur="6.781">we&amp;#39;re no longer going to ensure you and</text>

  <text start="1951.26" dur="6.33">so right now dr. Jim Willie is saying</text>
  <text start="1955.519" dur="3.87">that the biggest shock waves will come</text>
  <text start="1957.59" dur="4.199">from the currency reset followed by the</text>

  <text start="1961.789" dur="4.86">trade settlement the return of the gold</text>
  <text start="1964.519" dur="4.441">standard is an ear and we can see that</text>
  <text start="1966.649" dur="4.441">china is already pushing for this at</text>
  <text start="1968.96" dur="4.74">least 23 nations have already prepared</text>

  <text start="1973.7" dur="4.319">outside the dollar and Swiss systems</text>
  <text start="1975.95" dur="3.689">through their moves away from the</text>
  <text start="1978.019" dur="3.721">reliance on the dollar via the creation</text>
  <text start="1979.639" dur="4.17">of new currency swap lines major</text>
  <text start="1981.74" dur="5.939">economic powers are transitioning away</text>
  <text start="1983.809" dur="5.97">from the 42 year old petro dollar system</text>
  <text start="1987.679" dur="5.161">now we see all the indicators out there</text>
  <text start="1989.779" dur="5.13">we see what is happening and right now</text>
  <text start="1992.84" dur="4.02">what they&amp;#39;re predicting and this could</text>
  <text start="1994.909" dur="3.721">be higher because every time they give</text>
  <text start="1996.86" dur="3.419">us a percentage it is usually lower</text>
  <text start="1998.63" dur="3.84">let&amp;#39;s think back to Cyprus right now</text>
  <text start="2000.279" dur="3.661">they told us when they did their bank</text>
  <text start="2002.47" dur="2.039">holiday they closed all the banks down</text>
  <text start="2003.94" dur="1.859">the Cyprus</text>
  <text start="2004.509" dur="3.12">people couldn&amp;#39;t get their money they</text>
  <text start="2005.799" dur="4.35">said listen we&amp;#39;re only going to take</text>
  <text start="2007.629" dur="3.72">eight to ten percent of the people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2010.149" dur="3.96">money but that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="2011.349" dur="5.7">take and it turned out they took forty</text>
  <text start="2014.109" dur="4.95">seven percent of their money the IMF</text>
  <text start="2017.049" dur="3.78">makes prediction saying things are going</text>
  <text start="2019.059" dur="3.36">to be better and they give us this high</text>
  <text start="2020.829" dur="3.361">percentage saying that the economies are</text>
  <text start="2022.419" dur="4.47">going to better and it&amp;#39;s usually half</text>
  <text start="2024.19" dur="6.779">it&amp;#39;s usually the opposite way so right</text>
  <text start="2026.889" dur="6.51">now they are saying that the US dollar</text>
  <text start="2030.969" dur="5.7">is going to suffer a 30-percent</text>
  <text start="2033.399" dur="6.6">devaluation sometime between februari</text>
  <text start="2036.669" dur="6.06">and March of this year now the United</text>
  <text start="2039.999" dur="7.5">States we have to think about this for a</text>
  <text start="2042.729" dur="7.56">second has no gold most of the real</text>
  <text start="2047.499" dur="6.27">estate in the United States has already</text>
  <text start="2050.289" dur="6.451">been used for collateral for China and</text>
  <text start="2053.769" dur="7.56">other countries so we don&amp;#39;t own that</text>
  <text start="2056.74" dur="7.95">much at this point the other thing is we</text>
  <text start="2061.329" dur="6.631">are you losing the war in the Middle</text>
  <text start="2064.69" dur="6.78">East and in Africa in Thailand and</text>
  <text start="2067.96" dur="6.03">Ukraine we are losing ground and once</text>
  <text start="2071.47" dur="6.209">these nations the people of these</text>
  <text start="2073.99" dur="6.359">nations push and push and push and move</text>
  <text start="2077.679" dur="7.19">the central bankers and the US</text>
  <text start="2080.349" dur="9.361">government out of these countries other</text>
  <text start="2084.869" dur="8.68">countries will no longer need the US</text>
  <text start="2089.71" dur="6.03">dollar so what happens the value of this</text>
  <text start="2093.549" dur="5.25">dollar is going to decrease they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2095.74" dur="5.94">saying thirty percent what happens if</text>
  <text start="2098.799" dur="5.191">it&amp;#39;s forty or fifty or sixty percent</text>
  <text start="2101.68" dur="5.7">because if we look at all the indicators</text>
  <text start="2103.99" dur="6.869">we are leading in that direction now are</text>
  <text start="2107.38" dur="5.01">we going to see this happen the next day</text>
  <text start="2110.859" dur="3.99">this comes out and of course the</text>
  <text start="2112.39" dur="4.11">president will probably come out or you</text>
  <text start="2114.849" dur="3.121">know one or two things will happen the</text>
  <text start="2116.5" dur="3.049">president will come out and and just</text>
  <text start="2117.97" dur="3.69">like President Nixon came out saying</text>
  <text start="2119.549" dur="4.81">temporarily we&amp;#39;re coming off the gold</text>
  <text start="2121.66" dur="4.139">standard because of speculators the</text>
  <text start="2124.359" dur="3.631">president will come out with some type</text>
  <text start="2125.799" dur="6.151">of an excuse of why this is happening</text>
  <text start="2127.99" dur="6.269">and he said in the beginning we will not</text>
  <text start="2131.95" dur="3.869">notice a change because all the goods</text>
  <text start="2134.259" dur="3.871">and everything here in the United States</text>
  <text start="2135.819" dur="4.171">are all in the United States</text>
  <text start="2138.13" dur="3.09">but what happens is when people start</text>
  <text start="2139.99" dur="3.42">buying up the goods and they have to</text>
  <text start="2141.22" dur="4.8">reorder more this is when we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="2143.41" dur="3.93">see the prices start to skyrocket this</text>
  <text start="2146.02" dur="3.06">is when you&amp;#39;re going to see fuel</text>
  <text start="2147.34" dur="4.59">skyrocket this is when you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="2149.08" dur="5.22">see food on the shelf skyrocket and</text>
  <text start="2151.93" dur="6.3">other products skyrocket so what this</text>
  <text start="2154.3" dur="7.2">means is your ability to purchase has</text>
  <text start="2158.23" dur="6.6">been downgraded by thirty forty fifty</text>
  <text start="2161.5" dur="4.95">sixty percent so that carton of that</text>
  <text start="2164.83" dur="4.95">gallon of milk that was four dollars</text>
  <text start="2166.45" dur="7.38">might be fifteen dollars at this point</text>
  <text start="2169.78" dur="6.96">but you might not see it until May or</text>
  <text start="2173.83" dur="5.64">June maybe April depending on the time</text>
  <text start="2176.74" dur="5.31">frame we will have two definitely watch</text>
  <text start="2179.47" dur="4.92">for this and this is why we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2182.05" dur="4.89">prepping this is why you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2184.39" dur="4.65">stocking up on food this is why you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2186.94" dur="3.74">been stocking up on batteries this is</text>

  <text start="2190.68" dur="4.03">toiletries this is why you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2192.7" dur="3.9">stocking up on gold and silver and</text>
  <text start="2194.71" dur="3.42">keeping at least some cash in the house</text>
  <text start="2196.6" dur="4.8">because you know what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="2198.13" dur="6.75">a lot of people are going to have think</text>
  <text start="2201.4" dur="5.37">just think about this the day people see</text>
  <text start="2204.88" dur="4.26">that things are skyrocketing and all of</text>
  <text start="2206.77" dur="6.96">a sudden you know one day you see gas go</text>
  <text start="2209.14" dur="9.06">up to 450 and a week later it&amp;#39;s at 550</text>
  <text start="2213.73" dur="7.02">milk was at 409 and now it&amp;#39;s at 550 next</text>
