  <text start="313.45" dur="5.64">down those people who think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="315.22" dur="5.61">secure they&amp;#39;re not going to be and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="319.09" dur="4.32">gonna be a very difficult situation for</text>
  <text start="320.83" dur="4.98">them because you have to remember the</text>
  <text start="323.41" dur="4.68">first round in 2008 many of the people</text>
  <text start="325.81" dur="4.35">and I&amp;#39;ve been receiving a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="328.09" dur="4.44">emails from so many different people</text>

  <text start="332.53" dur="4.08">great job they owned many different</text>
  <text start="334.03" dur="4.98">homes and then all of a sudden they lost</text>
  <text start="336.61" dur="4.47">everything in 2008 and they could never</text>
  <text start="339.01" dur="6.81">really get back on their feet</text>
  <text start="341.08" dur="7.98">and this time around who&amp;#39;s left in the</text>
  <text start="345.82" dur="5.73">working place those people who weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="349.06" dur="5.55">really affected but guess what this time</text>
  <text start="351.55" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s going to happen to them and we have</text>
  <text start="354.61" dur="4.02">to remember this time it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="356.98" dur="5.93">worth why because the US government</text>
  <text start="358.63" dur="6.84">central bankers have made it worse I</text>
  <text start="362.91" dur="3.9">mean look at the numbers from ADP that</text>
  <text start="365.47" dur="6.72">just came out</text>

  <text start="494.79" dur="5.59">no everything&amp;#39;s fine we we just want a</text>
  <text start="498.37" dur="3.06">little bit of inflation that&amp;#39;s it you</text>

  <text start="519.659" dur="5.231">well when you look at what&amp;#39;s been going</text>
  <text start="522.669" dur="4.681">on here we already know food has</text>
  <text start="524.89" dur="5.01">continually gone up and for those people</text>
  <text start="527.35" dur="4.47">say no food is exactly the same look at</text>
  <text start="529.9" dur="5.07">your ingredients look at the sizes of</text>
  <text start="531.82" dur="5.07">the product they shrink it they remove</text>
  <text start="534.97" dur="4.71">ingredients they substitute ingredients</text>
  <text start="536.89" dur="5.07">to try to keep the prices stable when</text>
  <text start="539.68" dur="6.24">they can&amp;#39;t do that they eventually have</text>
  <text start="541.96" dur="8.61">to raise the price but if we look at</text>
  <text start="545.92" dur="9.06">other things like the cost of other</text>
  <text start="550.57" dur="7.56">things since 2000 we see that the</text>
  <text start="554.98" dur="8.7">Consumer Price Index is up 38% since</text>

  <text start="755.62" dur="6.03">they are doing it unless something else</text>
  <text start="758.44" dur="4.62">happens and something occurs out of</text>
  <text start="761.65" dur="4.41">their control because that can happen</text>

  <text start="803.59" dur="4.61">been talking a lot about the yuan</text>
  <text start="805.45" dur="5.37">remember becoming a reserve currency and</text>
  <text start="808.2" dur="3.64">I&amp;#39;ve said in the past that the United</text>
  <text start="810.82" dur="4.83">States is gonna do whatever they</text>
  <text start="811.84" dur="5.73">possibly can to try to stop this and we</text>
  <text start="815.65" dur="7.11">see there&amp;#39;s already political pressure</text>
  <text start="817.57" dur="7.59">on the yuan to make it not a reserve</text>
  <text start="822.76" dur="5.04">currency and right now the IMF has now</text>

  <text start="839.339" dur="7.021">September of 2016 they don&amp;#39;t know yet</text>
  <text start="842.25" dur="6.54">and we knew this was going to happen we</text>
  <text start="846.36" dur="3.93">knew it was going to happen sooner or</text>
  <text start="848.79" dur="4.08">later where the United States put</text>
  <text start="850.29" dur="5.13">pressure on the IMF to stop this from</text>
  <text start="852.87" dur="5.37">happening now we&amp;#39;ve been talking a lot</text>
