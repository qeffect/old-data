  <text start="281.04" dur="5.82">America Barclays saying oh yeah</text>
  <text start="283.979" dur="4.711">everyone&amp;#39;s involved in this now we</text>
  <text start="286.86" dur="5.58">understand they settled out of court</text>
  <text start="288.69" dur="7.47">they paid a fine but there are documents</text>
  <text start="292.44" dur="7.13">out there where they were speaking to</text>
  <text start="296.16" dur="7.14">each other and it shows they were</text>
  <text start="299.57" dur="5.5">manipulating the market now the</text>
  <text start="303.3" dur="5.76">documents were surrendered by Deutsche</text>
  <text start="305.07" dur="5.88">Bank and traders and submitters were</text>
  <text start="309.06" dur="4.35">captured coordinating trades in advance</text>
  <text start="310.95" dur="4.29">of a daily phone call manipulating the</text>
  <text start="313.41" dur="4.17">spot market for silver</text>
  <text start="315.24" dur="4.89">conspiring to fix the spread on silver</text>
  <text start="317.58" dur="8.25">offered to customers and using illegal</text>
  <text start="320.13" dur="8.46">strategies to rig prices and what we see</text>
  <text start="325.83" dur="6.769">right now is that the documents show</text>
  <text start="328.59" dur="6">among other things how to UBS traders</text>
  <text start="332.599" dur="3.701">communicated directly with Deutsche Bank</text>
  <text start="334.59" dur="5.52">traders and discuss ways to rig the</text>
  <text start="336.3" dur="5.489">market and if you want to see the text</text>
  <text start="340.11" dur="3.809">there on the x20 report if you&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="341.789" dur="4.291">youtube you&amp;#39;ll see it there in the first</text>
  <text start="343.919" dur="5.191">example you&amp;#39;ll see that Deutsche Bank</text>
  <text start="346.08" dur="6.51">and HSBC traders in which one HSB trader</text>
  <text start="349.11" dur="5.73">says really want to sell silver to which</text>
  <text start="352.59" dur="5.13">the other trader says let&amp;#39;s go and smash</text>
  <text start="354.84" dur="5.009">it together and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="357.72" dur="4.919">that this is ongoing</text>
  <text start="359.849" dur="5.82">and we can see from another chat</text>
  <text start="362.639" dur="4.921">transcript on May 11 2011 reveals a</text>
  <text start="365.669" dur="4.801">Deutsche Bank trader telling a UBS</text>
  <text start="367.56" dur="5.31">trader that the cartel were the silver</text>
  <text start="370.47" dur="4.71">market based on feedback from the</text>
  <text start="372.87" dur="4.44">outside traders to what UPS replies</text>
  <text start="375.18" dur="8.1">referring to the silver market we</text>
  <text start="377.31" dur="9.539">smashed it good on June 2011 chat</text>
  <text start="383.28" dur="5.449">between UBS and I do a bank trader comes</text>
  <text start="386.849" dur="7.231">down to the following if you have stops</text>
  <text start="388.729" dur="8.351">who you gonna call stop Buster&amp;#39;s and we</text>
  <text start="394.08" dur="5.369">can see right now that even though the</text>
  <text start="397.08" dur="3.899">corporate media and the US government</text>
  <text start="399.449" dur="6.481">and everyone else was saying that there</text>
  <text start="400.979" dur="7.351">is no manipulation there was and this</text>
  <text start="405.93" dur="4.079">goes much much further than this</text>
  <text start="408.33" dur="4.11">Deutsche Bank in these banks it goes all</text>
  <text start="410.009" dur="3.81">the way up to the central bank and what</text>
  <text start="412.44" dur="3.509">they&amp;#39;re very nervous about I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="413.819" dur="4.801">about the elite is that it will</text>
  <text start="415.949" dur="5.701">eventually get there remember they do</text>
  <text start="418.62" dur="6.87">believe there are two sets of laws one</text>
  <text start="421.65" dur="7.139">for delete and one for the serfs being</text>
  <text start="425.49" dur="7.169">us we can see this with Wells Fargo</text>
  <text start="428.789" dur="9.421">now remember Wells Fargo when they had</text>
  <text start="432.659" dur="10.35">all these fictitious accounts and they</text>
  <text start="438.21" dur="7.05">had employees basically set up all these</text>
  <text start="443.009" dur="5.34">different accounts using forged</text>
  <text start="445.26" dur="3.69">signatures and this was done like two</text>
  <text start="448.349" dur="2.761">million</text>
  <text start="448.95" dur="5.55">so they can collect the fees on accounts</text>
  <text start="451.11" dur="6.96">this is a fact now these individuals</text>
  <text start="454.5" dur="5.37">they want to sue but when you sign up</text>
  <text start="458.07" dur="4.35">for Wells Fargo account you&amp;#39;re required</text>
  <text start="459.87" dur="4.14">to sign an arbitration agreement giving</text>
  <text start="462.42" dur="4.2">up your right to sue the company and</text>
  <text start="464.01" dur="6.57">requiring you to have your case heard by</text>
  <text start="466.62" dur="9.03">an arbitrator paid for by and dependent</text>
  <text start="470.58" dur="9">on Wells Fargo instead now Wells Fargo</text>
  <text start="475.65" dur="7.71">is using the argument that since these</text>
  <text start="479.58" dur="7.05">accounts were signed up with forged</text>
  <text start="483.36" dur="5.91">signatures it applies to those</text>
  <text start="486.63" dur="8.97">individuals I know it sounds ridiculous</text>
  <text start="489.27" dur="10.11">but what&amp;#39;s worse is that the courts are</text>
  <text start="495.6" dur="6.18">buying it so basically someone forged</text>
  <text start="499.38" dur="5.25">your signature you can&amp;#39;t sue because</text>
  <text start="501.78" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re saying that you sign something</text>
  <text start="504.63" dur="4.65">that says you can&amp;#39;t sue but you never</text>
  <text start="506.79" dur="4.86">signed it and a federal judge ruled last</text>
  <text start="509.28" dur="3.72">year that it was not wholly groundless</text>
  <text start="511.65" dur="3.51">that a customer could be forced to</text>
  <text start="513" dur="7.05">arbitrate over accounts they have never</text>
  <text start="515.16" dur="9.48">agreed to that case is now being settled</text>
  <text start="520.05" dur="6.3">according to legal filings well of</text>
  <text start="524.64" dur="3.42">course they don&amp;#39;t want this to go into</text>
  <text start="526.35" dur="4.47">court they don&amp;#39;t want this publicized</text>
  <text start="528.06" dur="5.04">they want to keep it very quiet and most</text>
  <text start="530.82" dur="4.59">likely they&amp;#39;re gonna settle and pay</text>
  <text start="533.1" dur="5.64">these people off how much we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="535.41" dur="6.99">but it&amp;#39;s just amazing how they can twist</text>
  <text start="538.74" dur="7.5">the law and twist everything now we</text>
  <text start="542.4" dur="6.5">understand that this economy is dead in</text>
  <text start="546.24" dur="7.56">the water here if you really look at it</text>
  <text start="548.9" dur="8.83">we see there&amp;#39;s 300 trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="553.8" dur="7.17">worth of debt in the world that&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="557.73" dur="5.55">three times the global GDP which means</text>
  <text start="560.97" dur="5.34">every bit of potential collateral is</text>
  <text start="563.28" dur="7.92">pledged to someone somewhere in some</text>
  <text start="566.31" dur="10.19">fashion which means this really can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="571.2" dur="10.53">paid back it&amp;#39;s completely impossible and</text>
  <text start="576.5" dur="6.269">what&amp;#39;s even worse is that this is going</text>
  <text start="581.73" dur="4.759">to be</text>
  <text start="582.769" dur="8.37">an unorganized unwinding of trillions in</text>
  <text start="586.489" dur="9.21">debt and it&amp;#39;s going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="591.139" dur="6.81">mess when this happens and we can see</text>
  <text start="595.699" dur="3.44">there are warnings coming out from all</text>
  <text start="597.949" dur="4.411">over the place</text>
  <text start="599.139" dur="7.51">Shiller is warning that stocks are</text>
  <text start="602.36" dur="6.18">partying like it&amp;#39;s 1929 he says the</text>
  <text start="606.649" dur="5.19">latest lurched upwards in stock prices</text>
  <text start="608.54" dur="7.409">has just taken market valuations up into</text>
  <text start="611.839" dur="8.071">the skybox levels and it just went from</text>
  <text start="615.949" dur="7.05">flashing amber to flashing red and what</text>
  <text start="619.91" dur="6.779">he&amp;#39;s saying is that this just went off</text>
  <text start="622.999" dur="8.28">the charts and there is a gigantic risk</text>
  <text start="626.689" dur="8.76">of this whole thing just crashing and we</text>
  <text start="631.279" dur="6.93">can see right now that the S&amp;amp;P 500 well</text>
  <text start="635.449" dur="5.401">it just jumped to twenty seven point</text>
  <text start="638.209" dur="5.25">nine times the corporate earnings of the</text>
  <text start="640.85" dur="3.989">past ten years this is about the same</text>
  <text start="643.459" dur="5.3">level that the market hit just before</text>
  <text start="644.839" dur="7.651">the crash of 1929 and it is far higher</text>
  <text start="648.759" dur="5.86">than in 2008 what does this tell you</text>
  <text start="652.49" dur="5.329">this tells you we&amp;#39;re in big trouble</text>
  <text start="654.619" dur="5.94">and Shiller is using something called</text>
  <text start="657.819" dur="6.52">cyclically adjusted price to earnings</text>
  <text start="660.559" dur="6.24">ratio or Cape it is also known as the</text>
  <text start="664.339" dur="5.641">Shiller p/e after Yale&amp;#39;s Shiller who won</text>
  <text start="666.799" dur="5.16">a Nobel Prize for a research into it his</text>
  <text start="669.98" dur="4.469">data shows it has been a strong</text>
  <text start="671.959" dur="6.06">indicator of future stock returns going</text>
  <text start="674.449" dur="5.1">back to 1871 and the days of President</text>
  <text start="678.019" dur="3.331">Grant now</text>
  <text start="679.549" dur="3.33">Cape has plenty of critics many people</text>
  <text start="681.35" dur="5.819">in Wall Street will tell you to ignore</text>
  <text start="682.879" dur="7.44">it it&amp;#39;s not important but they use it</text>
  <text start="687.169" dur="6.33">incorrectly the Cape has said stocks are</text>
  <text start="690.319" dur="6.3">overvalued since mid 1990 and many point</text>
  <text start="693.499" dur="5.161">out yet shares keep going up well maybe</text>
  <text start="696.619" dur="4.351">but as it happens a new research paper</text>
  <text start="698.66" dur="4.859">by two economists strikes a strong blow</text>
  <text start="700.97" dur="4.859">on behalf of Cape in a nutshell this is</text>
  <text start="703.519" dur="4.32">what it is investors shouldn&amp;#39;t flee</text>
  <text start="705.829" dur="2.82">stock simply because the Shiller p/e is</text>
  <text start="707.839" dur="3.18">above average</text>
  <text start="708.649" dur="5.91">they shouldn&amp;#39;t flee stocks even when the</text>
  <text start="711.019" dur="4.92">Shiller p/e is way above average but</text>
  <text start="714.559" dur="3.06">history has</text>
  <text start="715.939" dur="7.16">they should flee stocks when the Shiller</text>
  <text start="717.619" dur="11.66">p/e is extreme extreme levels like now</text>
  <text start="723.099" dur="11.621">only when the Cape is higher than 27.6</text>
  <text start="729.279" dur="10.59">the stock market proves to be a really</text>
  <text start="734.72" dur="10.039">bad investment and guess where we are</text>
  <text start="739.869" dur="8.71">we&amp;#39;re at that point and this is why</text>
  <text start="744.759" dur="6.79">Shiller is out there saying the market</text>
  <text start="748.579" dur="5.641">is flashing red and when you look at</text>
  <text start="751.549" dur="7.95">this this is another indicator showing</text>
  <text start="754.22" dur="9.089">us that the system is coming down now</text>
  <text start="759.499" dur="5.88">Eric Sprott is out there and he is</text>
  <text start="763.309" dur="4.08">looking at the stock market and he says</text>
  <text start="765.379" dur="4.591">it&amp;#39;s a complete propaganda tool which I</text>
  <text start="767.389" dur="6.24">agree it is completely a propaganda tool</text>
  <text start="769.97" dur="7.139">and what he&amp;#39;s saying is that when you</text>
  <text start="773.629" dur="6.8">look at this they&amp;#39;re using manipulative</text>
  <text start="777.109" dur="8.37">techniques and the Fed right now is</text>
  <text start="780.429" dur="8.17">pouring in huge amount of funds into the</text>
  <text start="785.479" dur="5.45">market because the only thing that can</text>
  <text start="788.599" dur="5.7">explain the move in the stock market</text>
  <text start="790.929" dur="6.36">after the election is massive fed</text>
  <text start="794.299" dur="5.73">stimulus in some form either direct cash</text>
  <text start="797.289" dur="4.69">injections done in there in a format</text>
  <text start="800.029" dur="4.8">that we that won&amp;#39;t show up in the Fed&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="801.979" dur="4.11">balance sheet or a massive spike up in</text>
  <text start="804.829" dur="3.69">the availability of short term credit</text>

  <text start="1012.05" dur="8.17">all throughout the years this is no</text>
  <text start="1017.1" dur="5.7">different now there are many different</text>
  <text start="1020.22" dur="6.03">things that could cause this economy to</text>
  <text start="1022.8" dur="6.72">come down and we know that the central</text>
  <text start="1026.25" dur="5.25">bankers the elite the US government they</text>
  <text start="1029.52" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t want this to come down without</text>
  <text start="1031.5" dur="4.8">them bringing it down themselves and we</text>
  <text start="1034.38" dur="3.569">see what&amp;#39;s going on in Italy we see</text>
  <text start="1036.3" dur="5.149">what&amp;#39;s going on in Germany with Deutsche</text>
  <text start="1037.949" dur="6.48">Bank we see what&amp;#39;s going on in Japan and</text>
  <text start="1041.449" dur="5.021">they&amp;#39;re very nervous about a black swan</text>
  <text start="1044.429" dur="5.25">where something just starts to unfold</text>
  <text start="1046.47" dur="6.72">they can&amp;#39;t stop it and it continues on</text>
  <text start="1049.679" dur="7.861">and we see there&amp;#39;s a banking crisis</text>
  <text start="1053.19" dur="7.86">brewing at this point the Italian</text>
  <text start="1057.54" dur="6.889">banking system is a mile high house of</text>
  <text start="1061.05" dur="6.57">cards and it looks like the collapse is</text>
  <text start="1064.429" dur="8.201">imminent right now if we look at monte</text>
  <text start="1067.62" dur="8.34">de poshi-ne thing off now they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1072.63" dur="7.28">to contain it and if you notice they</text>
  <text start="1075.96" dur="8.24">tried to contain Bear Stearns AIG Lehman</text>
  <text start="1079.91" dur="8.32">and everything started to fall apart and</text>
  <text start="1084.2" dur="6.67">we can see right now that if the capital</text>
  <text start="1088.23" dur="5.25">raising efforts fail if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1090.87" dur="4.89">nationalize the bank and they can&amp;#39;t prop</text>
  <text start="1093.48" dur="7.77">it up they&amp;#39;re gonna have to resort to</text>
  <text start="1095.76" dur="8.28">balance and this would have a really bad</text>
  <text start="1101.25" dur="5.37">effect on the rest of Europe if they do</text>
  <text start="1104.04" dur="5.85">this and people will look at this and</text>
  <text start="1106.62" dur="7.09">say okay we see what&amp;#39;s going on and this</text>
  <text start="1109.89" dur="8.95">would start to bring down everything</text>
  <text start="1113.71" dur="7.05">but we have to understand that Italy has</text>
  <text start="1118.84" dur="4.709">one of the most indebted governments in</text>
  <text start="1120.76" dur="5.039">the world it borrowed over two point</text>
  <text start="1123.549" dur="6.24">four trillion and its debt to GDP ratio</text>
  <text start="1125.799" dur="6.091">is north of a hundred thirty percent for</text>
  <text start="1129.789" dur="5.52">comparison the u.s. debt to GDP ratio is</text>
  <text start="1131.89" dur="6.33">a hundred and four percent but the</text>
  <text start="1135.309" dur="5.25">situation is actually much worse because</text>
  <text start="1138.22" dur="6.47">GDP measures a country&amp;#39;s economic output</text>
  <text start="1140.559" dur="6.541">and it&amp;#39;s really misleading because the</text>
  <text start="1144.69" dur="5.08">mainstream economists count government</text>
  <text start="1147.1" dur="6.059">spending as a positive when calculating</text>
  <text start="1149.77" dur="6.06">GDP and really you should really count</text>
  <text start="1153.159" dur="6.27">this as a negative just like they count</text>
  <text start="1155.83" dur="4.979">debt as positive over one trillion worth</text>
  <text start="1159.429" dur="7.081">of Italian bonds I actually have</text>
  <text start="1160.809" dur="9.691">negative yields that&amp;#39;s crazy this means</text>
  <text start="1166.51" dur="6.75">there are two possibilities at for this</text>
  <text start="1170.5" dur="3.99">situation first the European Central</text>
  <text start="1173.26" dur="3.69">Bank will have to put the printing</text>
  <text start="1174.49" dur="4.52">presses into overdrive to accelerate its</text>
  <text start="1176.95" dur="4.29">program to buy Italian government bonds</text>
  <text start="1179.01" dur="3.97">the alternative is that the Italian</text>
  <text start="1181.24" dur="5.429">government will have to acknowledge its</text>
  <text start="1182.98" dur="7.29">bankrupt I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re gonna do</text>
  <text start="1186.669" dur="6.471">that so I think they&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="1190.27" dur="7.22">push the printing presses into overdrive</text>
  <text start="1193.14" dur="6.82">because if they acknowledge bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="1197.49" dur="4.24">things will start to rapidly deteriorate</text>
  <text start="1199.96" dur="4.74">but when we look at this we can see that</text>
  <text start="1201.73" dur="6.63">things are really starting to unfold</text>
  <text start="1204.7" dur="5.37">right now and the situation is gonna get</text>
  <text start="1208.36" dur="4.169">a lot worse it&amp;#39;s not gonna get better</text>
  <text start="1210.07" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s not going to improve even if they</text>
  <text start="1212.529" dur="7.921">put a little band-aid fix on it it won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1215.62" dur="7.62">matter because it&amp;#39;s like a small</text>
  <text start="1220.45" dur="4.92">snowball coming down a mountain it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1223.24" dur="4.97">gaining speed it&amp;#39;s getting bigger and</text>
  <text start="1225.37" dur="5.25">bigger it&amp;#39;s getting larger and larger</text>
  <text start="1228.21" dur="4.51">yes it might take a different path down</text>
  <text start="1230.62" dur="4.32">the mountain but it&amp;#39;s still getting</text>
  <text start="1232.72" dur="4.65">bigger and eventually what happens it</text>
  <text start="1234.94" dur="4.68">gets so big that it doesn&amp;#39;t matter which</text>
  <text start="1237.37" dur="4.89">path it&amp;#39;s on because it covers the</text>
  <text start="1239.62" dur="4.98">entire area and smashes everything in</text>
  <text start="1242.26" dur="4.889">its path this is what&amp;#39;s happening right</text>
  <text start="1244.6" dur="2.939">now listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
