  <text start="89.27" dur="4.59">is all about and I&amp;#39;ve been saying this</text>
  <text start="92.75" dur="4.049">for quite a while</text>
  <text start="93.86" dur="4.859">remember the central bankers had a plan</text>
  <text start="96.799" dur="4.651">to bring down the entire system they</text>
  <text start="98.719" dur="6.51">needed to reset it their system that</text>
  <text start="101.45" dur="6.779">were in today can&amp;#39;t go on much longer</text>
  <text start="105.229" dur="5.07">every fiat system has a time period</text>
  <text start="108.229" dur="5.401">where it completely collapses by itself</text>
  <text start="110.299" dur="5.551">and they need to restart it the plan has</text>
  <text start="113.63" dur="4.589">changed now they&amp;#39;re not in control they</text>
  <text start="115.85" dur="5.64">don&amp;#39;t have the narrative and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="118.219" dur="5.551">seeing right now there are countries the</text>
  <text start="121.49" dur="6.75">United States included Europe China</text>
  <text start="123.77" dur="8.25">Russia they are now moving away from the</text>
  <text start="128.24" dur="5.9">dollar they are making preparations now</text>
  <text start="132.02" dur="5.939">they weren&amp;#39;t really supposed to do this</text>
  <text start="134.14" dur="5.95">right now I mean they were but we were</text>
  <text start="137.959" dur="4.5">supposed to have a war and this would</text>
  <text start="140.09" dur="5.64">have been you know presented after the</text>
  <text start="142.459" dur="6.061">war and people wouldn&amp;#39;t said okay yep</text>
  <text start="145.73" dur="4.5">the United States is demolished and we</text>
  <text start="148.52" dur="4.62">know the reason why the United States</text>
  <text start="150.23" dur="4.979">would not come out as a victor because</text>
  <text start="153.14" dur="3.75">we know that certain individuals like</text>
  <text start="155.209" dur="5.28">the Clintons and everyone else were song</text>
  <text start="156.89" dur="5.87">secrets making the other side and that</text>
  <text start="160.489" dur="6.28">would have been most likely China</text>
  <text start="162.76" dur="9.619">and having the ability to bring down</text>
  <text start="166.769" dur="9.521">planes making ships you know completely</text>
  <text start="172.379" dur="7.771">non operational and this would have been</text>
  <text start="176.29" dur="8.279">a turning point this was their plan now</text>
  <text start="180.15" dur="6.369">their plan is out the window and they</text>
  <text start="184.569" dur="5.551">don&amp;#39;t have much of a choice right now</text>
  <text start="186.519" dur="6.75">because the system is coming down the</text>
  <text start="190.12" dur="4.55">global economic system is about to</text>
  <text start="193.269" dur="3.72">implode</text>
  <text start="194.67" dur="4.239">because this is the way the central bank</text>
  <text start="196.989" dur="4.65">system works has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="198.909" dur="5.55">Trump&amp;#39;s tariffs or what&amp;#39;s going on now</text>
  <text start="201.639" dur="4.891">it has to do with what the central banks</text>
  <text start="204.459" dur="4.95">have done from the beginning they start</text>
  <text start="206.53" dur="4.859">a system they run it until they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="209.409" dur="4.321">get any more out of it they steal the</text>
  <text start="211.389" dur="5.19">wealth from the people and once that is</text>
  <text start="213.73" dur="4.56">all said and done what do they do well</text>
  <text start="216.579" dur="4.141">they cover it up with some type of an</text>
  <text start="218.29" dur="4.05">event they don&amp;#39;t have the event right</text>
  <text start="220.72" dur="5.189">now and they&amp;#39;re not going to have the</text>
  <text start="222.34" dur="6.179">event so what a country&amp;#39;s do at this</text>
  <text start="225.909" dur="5.241">point well they start they need to start</text>
  <text start="228.519" dur="5.31">to transition away from the dollar and</text>
  <text start="231.15" dur="6.58">this is what China this is what Russia</text>
  <text start="233.829" dur="6.951">this is what Europe is doing right now</text>
  <text start="237.73" dur="5.28">and many other countries are following</text>
  <text start="240.78" dur="4.959">how do we know the system&amp;#39;s falling</text>
  <text start="243.01" dur="4.319">apart well we&amp;#39;ve been tracking the</text>
  <text start="245.739" dur="4.47">economy for a very long time it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="247.329" dur="4.201">falling apart very very rapidly most of</text>
  <text start="250.209" dur="3.511">the numbers that are coming out of the</text>
  <text start="251.53" dur="5.16">government are the same manipulation</text>
  <text start="253.72" dur="6.299">that has been used for a very long time</text>
  <text start="256.69" dur="6.06">Trump is just continuing this using it</text>
  <text start="260.019" dur="4.051">to his benefit this way the deep state</text>
  <text start="262.75" dur="3.57">the central bank&amp;#39;s can&amp;#39;t and the</text>
  <text start="264.07" dur="4.65">mainstream media can&amp;#39;t blame him for a</text>
  <text start="266.32" dur="3.81">failed economy because of the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="268.72" dur="3.21">doing fantastic and the stock market&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="270.13" dur="3.8">doing fantastic using their manipulation</text>
  <text start="271.93" dur="5.549">against them what are they going to do</text>
  <text start="273.93" dur="5.919">well we see that certain areas things</text>
  <text start="277.479" dur="4.47">are rapidly falling apart I mean the BLS</text>
  <text start="279.849" dur="4.471">report and we know this is a completely</text>
  <text start="281.949" dur="5.041">manipulated report we know there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="284.32" dur="4.68">of people out of the job market but what</text>
  <text start="286.99" dur="3.989">we see here is that the November payroll</text>
  <text start="289" dur="4.86">numbers they completely disappointed</text>
  <text start="290.979" dur="5.091">October it was revised and it was</text>
  <text start="293.86" dur="3.62">revised lower from 252</text>
  <text start="296.07" dur="5.79">fifty thousand two hundred thirty seven</text>
  <text start="297.48" dur="6.93">thousand now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is what</text>
  <text start="301.86" dur="6">we&amp;#39;ve seen all along the number of</text>
  <text start="304.41" dur="5.24">people out of the labor market is at an</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="5.79">all-time high</text>
  <text start="309.65" dur="6.67">it&amp;#39;s at a four-year high it is not moved</text>
  <text start="313.65" dur="5.4">anywhere it is dropped to this level</text>
  <text start="316.32" dur="6.84">which is the level back say around</text>
  <text start="319.05" dur="6.09">nineteen seventy six or so and it really</text>
  <text start="323.16" dur="6.6">hasn&amp;#39;t moved it&amp;#39;s bobbed up and down</text>
  <text start="325.14" dur="7.98">since 2015 and these are people that</text>
  <text start="329.76" dur="3.99">want to work but they can&amp;#39;t find a job</text>
  <text start="333.12" dur="3.3">remember</text>
  <text start="333.75" dur="3.96">those people who haven&amp;#39;t been on an</text>
  <text start="336.42" dur="4.4">interview in four weeks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="337.71" dur="6.36">considered no longer looking for a job</text>
  <text start="340.82" dur="6.67">how do they count people having a job</text>
  <text start="344.07" dur="4.73">lump if you worked one hour a week you</text>
  <text start="347.49" dur="5.66">got a job</text>
  <text start="348.8" dur="7.75">this is manipulation at its best</text>
  <text start="353.15" dur="5.35">we know the housing market is starting</text>
  <text start="356.55" dur="3.9">to fall apart very very rapidly the Fed</text>
  <text start="358.5" dur="3.15">is raising rates very very slowly and</text>
  <text start="360.45" dur="4.26">this is what they&amp;#39;ve done in the past</text>
  <text start="361.65" dur="5.79">this is nothing new and they might skip</text>
  <text start="364.71" dur="6.78">a rate or two but they&amp;#39;re doing it very</text>
  <text start="367.44" dur="7.14">slowly now who&amp;#39;s directing them it is</text>
  <text start="371.49" dur="5.04">Trump remember the plan is not to hurt</text>
  <text start="374.58" dur="4.92">everyone the plan is to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="376.53" dur="5.61">central bank economy but in the process</text>
  <text start="379.5" dur="5.12">don&amp;#39;t hurt the people as best you</text>
  <text start="382.14" dur="4.95">possibly can but when you look at</text>
  <text start="384.62" dur="6.46">house-flipping right now it is at a</text>
  <text start="387.09" dur="6.12">two-year low and this is the canary in</text>
  <text start="391.08" dur="6.27">the coal mine for a cooling housing</text>
  <text start="393.21" dur="7.56">market housing flips they are down right</text>
  <text start="397.35" dur="4.98">now which means that people aren&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="400.77" dur="3.24">out and speculating and going out and</text>
  <text start="402.33" dur="3.81">buying that house hoping that it</text>
  <text start="404.01" dur="3.15">appreciates redoing it and then selling</text>
  <text start="406.14" dur="3.45">it because they&amp;#39;re starting to realize</text>
  <text start="407.16" dur="4.41">that prices are coming down when prices</text>
  <text start="409.59" dur="4.56">are going up it&amp;#39;s fantastic you can go</text>
  <text start="411.57" dur="4.44">out you can purchase a house you got 30</text>
  <text start="414.15" dur="3.75">40 days to redo it</text>
  <text start="416.01" dur="4.5">hopefully it appreciates during that</text>
  <text start="417.9" dur="5.52">period of time hopefully you improve it</text>
  <text start="420.51" dur="5.63">and you come you walk away with a profit</text>
  <text start="423.42" dur="5.59">when the housing prices are coming down</text>
  <text start="426.14" dur="5.33">well that&amp;#39;s a little bit of a problem</text>
  <text start="429.01" dur="4.74">because you buy the house 30 days 40</text>
  <text start="431.47" dur="5.01">days later it&amp;#39;s worth less no matter how</text>
  <text start="433.75" dur="4.86">much you improve it the house is worth</text>
  <text start="436.48" dur="4.71">less and this is why people are getting</text>
  <text start="438.61" dur="4.89">out of the market we see manufacturing</text>
  <text start="441.19" dur="7.23">jobs in the United States they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="443.5" dur="6.87">increased by 27,000 in November now when</text>
  <text start="448.42" dur="5.88">we look at these numbers we need to put</text>
  <text start="450.37" dur="5.4">it in context in December 2016 the last</text>
  <text start="454.3" dur="4.05">month before President Trump was</text>
  <text start="455.77" dur="5.1">inaugurated there were twelve point</text>
  <text start="458.35" dur="5.13">three five million manufacturing jobs in</text>
  <text start="460.87" dur="6.74">the United States since he&amp;#39;s been in</text>
  <text start="463.48" dur="8.16">office manufacturing jobs have gone up</text>
  <text start="467.61" dur="7.69">456 thousand now it seems like a lot and</text>
  <text start="471.64" dur="4.98">remember he can&amp;#39;t do this overnight it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="475.3" dur="2.52">not like you snap your fingers and all</text>
  <text start="476.62" dur="2.37">the manufacturing jobs and all the</text>
  <text start="477.82" dur="4.17">companies come back to united states</text>
  <text start="478.99" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s impossible because the deep state</text>
  <text start="481.99" dur="2.01">the central banks they&amp;#39;ve had a very</text>
  <text start="483.04" dur="2.82">very long time</text>
  <text start="484" dur="5.13">to move the manufacturing jobs out of</text>
  <text start="485.86" dur="5.94">the United States but when you look at</text>
  <text start="489.13" dur="6.54">the historical data on manufacturing</text>
  <text start="491.8" dur="9.51">jobs you get a sense of where we are at</text>
  <text start="495.67" dur="9.39">now if we go back to 1979 this was at</text>
  <text start="501.31" dur="6.81">the peak of manufacturing employment we</text>
  <text start="505.06" dur="5.82">had nineteen point five million</text>
  <text start="508.12" dur="7.229">manufacturing jobs here in the United</text>
  <text start="510.88" dur="8.61">States so right now we are 7.2 million</text>
  <text start="515.349" dur="6.691">people away from the peak manufacturing</text>
  <text start="519.49" dur="5.34">here in the United States even if Trump</text>
  <text start="522.04" dur="7.92">wants to bring back half of that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="524.83" dur="8.37">three and a half million jobs this is</text>
  <text start="529.96" dur="5.43">how far away we are now yes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="533.2" dur="5.1">gonna continually do this but can they</text>
  <text start="535.39" dur="6">bring all these jobs back today tomorrow</text>
  <text start="538.3" dur="4.5">the next day no but we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="541.39" dur="4.53">going through this transition and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="542.8" dur="6.06">coming up very very quickly what Trump</text>
  <text start="545.92" dur="5.49">is doing is he&amp;#39;s preparing the United</text>
  <text start="548.86" dur="4.74">States to make it economically feasible</text>
  <text start="551.41" dur="4.71">for these corporations these</text>
  <text start="553.6" dur="5.49">manufacturers to come back to the United</text>
  <text start="556.12" dur="5.01">States because once we go into a</text>
  <text start="559.09" dur="3.77">transitional phase and we start to</text>
  <text start="561.13" dur="3.65">remove the regulations</text>
  <text start="562.86" dur="3.93">make it beneficial for these companies</text>
  <text start="564.78" dur="5.4">come back with you know bringing down</text>
  <text start="566.79" dur="6">the taxes removing tax laws and doing</text>
  <text start="570.18" dur="4.08">many of those things manufacturing will</text>
  <text start="572.79" dur="2.58">head back here to the nine states and</text>
  <text start="574.26" dur="3.12">remember the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="575.37" dur="4.32">banks they created all these regulations</text>
  <text start="577.38" dur="5.46">they created all these tax laws to push</text>
  <text start="579.69" dur="7.31">companies out of here it was done on</text>
  <text start="582.84" dur="7.29">purpose now Trump tweeted out today and</text>
  <text start="587" dur="5.86">this is a statement from China the teams</text>
  <text start="590.13" dur="4.59">of both sides are now having a smooth</text>
  <text start="592.86" dur="4.26">communications a good cooperation with</text>
  <text start="594.72" dur="4.29">each other we are full of confidence</text>
  <text start="597.12" dur="4.59">that an agreement can be reached within</text>
  <text start="599.01" dur="7.23">the next 90 days I agree</text>
  <text start="601.71" dur="7.53">Trump and what he&amp;#39;s doing right now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="606.24" dur="5.73">trying to lay the groundwork for this</text>
  <text start="609.24" dur="4.08">transition the transition that not just</text>
  <text start="611.97" dur="3.12">the United States is going to be going</text>
  <text start="613.32" dur="3.48">through the world is going to be going</text>
  <text start="615.09" dur="3.48">through now remember in the beginning we</text>
  <text start="616.8" dur="5.33">talked about how the central bank had a</text>
  <text start="618.57" dur="5.61">plan to move the economic system to</text>
  <text start="622.13" dur="4.48">someplace else they were going to</text>
  <text start="624.18" dur="4.2">destroy the old one start a brand new</text>
  <text start="626.61" dur="4.65">system they were gonna cover this up</text>
  <text start="628.38" dur="3.33">with a major major event this is not</text>
  <text start="631.26" dur="2.91">happening</text>
  <text start="631.71" dur="4.2">Russia and China they&amp;#39;ve been preparing</text>
  <text start="634.17" dur="3.96">to move away from the dollar for a very</text>
  <text start="635.91" dur="6.56">long time actually China most likely was</text>
  <text start="638.13" dur="8.01">slated to be the next economic power of</text>
  <text start="642.47" dur="4.89">the world and the central bank</text>
  <text start="646.14" dur="4.13">eventually would have taken over</text>
  <text start="647.36" dur="7.06">everything that was happening there and</text>
  <text start="650.27" dur="7.54">pushing their agenda outward to the rest</text>
  <text start="654.42" dur="7.47">of the world today Trump is working with</text>
  <text start="657.81" dur="7.35">China Trump is maneuvering around the</text>
  <text start="661.89" dur="5.58">central bank but Russia they&amp;#39;ve set up a</text>
  <text start="665.16" dur="4.68">payment system China has set up a</text>
