  <text start="53.2" dur="4.74">hi and welcome you listening to the ex</text>
  <text start="56.38" dur="5.07">wanting to report my name is Dave and</text>
  <text start="57.94" dur="6.36">this is episode 1552 a and today&amp;#39;s date</text>
  <text start="61.45" dur="5.34">is April 24th 2018 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="64.3" dur="5.22">episode is the creation of a new</text>
  <text start="66.79" dur="5.91">international trade currency will damage</text>
  <text start="69.52" dur="5.49">the dollar let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="72.7" dur="4.68">collapse financial news now it looks</text>
  <text start="75.01" dur="3.99">like the central bankers they have done</text>
  <text start="77.38" dur="3.599">it they have created the bubble of all</text>
  <text start="79" dur="4.08">bubbles in the housing market and again</text>
  <text start="80.979" dur="4.5">you need to remember that this is in the</text>
  <text start="83.08" dur="5.16">20 cities that Case Shiller follows and</text>
  <text start="85.479" dur="4.771">they include this in their stats now</text>
  <text start="88.24" dur="5.64">what the central bankers have done is</text>
  <text start="90.25" dur="5.729">they have pushed the prices of homes to</text>
  <text start="93.88" dur="6.36">the highest that we&amp;#39;ve seen actually</text>
  <text start="95.979" dur="7.821">higher than the peak of 2006 almost 7</text>
  <text start="100.24" dur="8.25">percent above that so this shows us that</text>
  <text start="103.8" dur="7.3">this bubble is huge now the housing</text>
  <text start="108.49" dur="4.94">market is starting to overheat now</text>
  <text start="111.1" dur="5.22">according to the latest BIOS BLS data</text>
  <text start="113.43" dur="4.9">average hourly wages for all US workers</text>
  <text start="116.32" dur="4.38">in November rose at a relatively brisk</text>
  <text start="118.33" dur="5.16">2.7 percent relative to the previous</text>
  <text start="120.7" dur="3.869">year now it is below the feds target of</text>
  <text start="123.49" dur="3.18">three and a half to four and a half</text>
  <text start="124.569" dur="3.271">percent and the economists they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="126.67" dur="2.88">scratching their heads they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="127.84" dur="4.8">okay wait let&amp;#39;s go back up here for a</text>
  <text start="129.55" dur="4.23">sec we have 2.7 percent wage increase</text>
  <text start="132.64" dur="2.55">we&amp;#39;re supposed to have anywhere between</text>
  <text start="133.78" dur="3.75">three and a half four and a half percent</text>
  <text start="135.19" dur="6.629">the unemployment rate is at 4.1 percent</text>
  <text start="137.53" dur="7.2">and no slack in the economy fails to</text>
  <text start="141.819" dur="5.371">boost wage growth now if we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="144.73" dur="5.16">the wage growth how is the housing</text>
  <text start="147.19" dur="3.57">market doing better and better that</text>
  <text start="149.89" dur="2.61">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="150.76" dur="4.11">because if we take a quick look at the</text>
  <text start="152.5" dur="3.95">US housing it shows that while wages may</text>
  <text start="154.87" dur="4.02">be growing at roughly 2.7 percent</text>
  <text start="156.45" dur="5.77">according to the latest case Shiller</text>
  <text start="158.89" dur="5.73">data 18 of the 20 metro areas in the US</text>
  <text start="162.22" dur="5.489">so home prices grow at a higher pace so</text>
  <text start="164.62" dur="5.04">basically how are these people affording</text>
  <text start="167.709" dur="4.441">these homes they&amp;#39;re not there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="169.66" dur="4.71">something wrong here something doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="172.15" dur="5.93">add up and they keep telling us that</text>
  <text start="174.37" dur="6.51">existing homes new homes sales are going</text>
  <text start="178.08" dur="5.739">fantastically and we had a drop in</text>
  <text start="180.88" dur="6.06">February of new home sales about 0.6% it</text>
  <text start="183.819" dur="5.701">was revised to 3.6</text>
  <text start="186.94" dur="5.34">so we had a negative 0.6% it was revised</text>
  <text start="189.52" dur="5.52">higher 23.6% and if we take a closer</text>
  <text start="192.28" dur="4.68">look at the numbers we look at them and</text>
  <text start="195.04" dur="4.17">we say okay how is this possible because</text>
  <text start="196.96" dur="5.52">in the Northeast well new home sales are</text>
  <text start="199.21" dur="5.4">down by negative 50 4.8% the Midwest is</text>
  <text start="202.48" dur="4.83">down by negative two point four percent</text>
  <text start="204.61" dur="6">the South came in at point eight percent</text>
  <text start="207.31" dur="5.79">the West is the only place where we see</text>
  <text start="210.61" dur="4.29">housing numbers new home sales up twenty</text>
  <text start="213.1" dur="3.93">eight percent but we have unemployment</text>
  <text start="214.9" dur="3.93">at four point one percent people are</text>
  <text start="217.03" dur="3.78">making less money people have part-time</text>
  <text start="218.83" dur="4.29">jobs they don&amp;#39;t have the full-time jobs</text>
  <text start="220.81" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re not saving because we know the</text>
  <text start="223.12" dur="3.96">savings rate is continually declining</text>
  <text start="224.53" dur="4.56">home ownership is at the lowest that</text>
  <text start="227.08" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;ve ever seen it but they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="229.09" dur="4.32">us that everything is fine no something</text>
  <text start="232.33" dur="3.54">is wrong here</text>
  <text start="233.41" dur="4.62">somebody is lying someone is</text>
  <text start="235.87" dur="5.43">manipulating the data to make everyone</text>
  <text start="238.03" dur="5.52">believe that we are in this incredible</text>
  <text start="241.3" dur="4.71">economy and we&amp;#39;re just chugging along</text>
  <text start="243.55" dur="4.47">now this started back in 2008 right</text>
  <text start="246.01" dur="4.32">after the financial crisis and they</text>
  <text start="248.02" dur="4.439">haven&amp;#39;t stopped with the data it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="250.33" dur="3.54">continuing on here but when we start to</text>
  <text start="252.459" dur="3.931">look at other indicators like the</text>
  <text start="253.87" dur="5.88">Richmond Fed survey it is crashed by</text>
  <text start="256.39" dur="5.46">most in 25 years now we came from record</text>
  <text start="259.75" dur="3.54">highs just a couple months ago and then</text>
  <text start="261.85" dur="3.99">all of a sudden Manufacturing has</text>
  <text start="263.29" dur="4.74">crashed by the most like we said in 25</text>
  <text start="265.84" dur="6.39">years new orders collapsed by negative</text>
  <text start="268.03" dur="6.84">nine from +17 order backlogs plunged by</text>
  <text start="272.23" dur="4.29">negative four from positive ten and we</text>
  <text start="274.87" dur="4.98">could see that the work week dropped</text>
  <text start="276.52" dur="7.19">notably so something is going on here</text>
  <text start="279.85" dur="7.05">the economy is not doing as well as</text>
  <text start="283.71" dur="4.78">everyone is saying all they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="286.9" dur="4.59">manipulating numbers we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="288.49" dur="5.31">before back in 2002 2008 actually when</text>
  <text start="291.49" dur="5.52">they told us the economy is fantastic</text>
  <text start="293.8" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s everything is contained housing is</text>
  <text start="297.01" dur="2.94">not going to be dropping the market</text>
  <text start="299.02" dur="3.149">looks great</text>
  <text start="299.95" dur="5.61">none of these corporations are in</text>
  <text start="302.169" dur="6.061">trouble the subprime securities are all</text>
  <text start="305.56" dur="5.37">triple-a all of it was a complete and</text>
  <text start="308.23" dur="6.09">utter lie now other countries realize</text>
  <text start="310.93" dur="5.94">that the dollar is doomed they realize</text>
  <text start="314.32" dur="4.5">that the economy basically is fake phony</text>
  <text start="316.87" dur="3.33">and false we see that Russia and China</text>
  <text start="318.82" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;ve been purchasing gold</text>
  <text start="320.2" dur="4.83">actually Russia has bought three hundred</text>
  <text start="322.66" dur="7.14">thousand ounces of gold in March and</text>
  <text start="325.03" dur="7.8">it&amp;#39;s nearing 2,000 tons in gold reserves</text>
  <text start="329.8" dur="5.49">remember Turkey is removing its gold</text>
  <text start="332.83" dur="5.04">from the US and other countries like</text>
  <text start="335.29" dur="4.68">Venezuela Germany they have already</text>
  <text start="337.87" dur="4.38">repatriated their gold and other</text>
  <text start="339.97" dur="4.56">countries are looking to do the same now</text>
  <text start="342.25" dur="4.62">they realize these countries that</text>
  <text start="344.53" dur="3.93">something is going on with the economy</text>
  <text start="346.87" dur="3.03">there&amp;#39;s too much debt they know the</text>
  <text start="348.46" dur="3.15">dollar is not going to be around that</text>
  <text start="349.9" dur="4.02">much longer the leaders of these</text>
  <text start="351.61" dur="5.13">countries they know what is happening</text>
  <text start="353.92" dur="6.18">here they know that everything is about</text>
  <text start="356.74" dur="5.01">to reset that the debt level around the</text>
  <text start="360.1" dur="4.62">world which is caused by the central</text>
  <text start="361.75" dur="5.13">bank cannot continue on this is why</text>
  <text start="364.72" dur="4.44">Putin took control of his private</text>
  <text start="366.88" dur="5.01">western central bank he calls the shots</text>
  <text start="369.16" dur="5.88">in his country China is now working with</text>
  <text start="371.89" dur="5.37">the United States and with Putin to</text>
  <text start="375.04" dur="4.4">remove the central banking system now</text>
  <text start="377.26" dur="4.74">the BRICS are creating a new</text>
  <text start="379.44" dur="4.96">international trade currency now this is</text>
  <text start="382" dur="4.95">going to damage the dollar it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="384.4" dur="5.73">be a catastrophic event</text>
  <text start="386.95" dur="4.44">now countries and we know that China is</text>
  <text start="390.13" dur="3.03">creating the belt and row they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="391.39" dur="3.78">putting in high-speed rails and things</text>
  <text start="393.16" dur="5.22">like that we know they are part of the</text>
  <text start="395.17" dur="7.53">BRICS nations which is Brazil Russia</text>
  <text start="398.38" dur="6.72">India China South Africa and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="402.7" dur="4.53">creating their own international trade</text>
  <text start="405.1" dur="4.5">currency now let&amp;#39;s take a look at what</text>
  <text start="407.23" dur="4.86">has already been done here or is on its</text>
  <text start="409.6" dur="4.23">way the Bank of Russia has already</text>
  <text start="412.09" dur="3.33">signed an agreement with China to set up</text>
  <text start="413.83" dur="4.05">bilateral gold trade which should be</text>
  <text start="415.42" dur="5.73">formulated and functional in 2018 we</text>
  <text start="417.88" dur="6">know the BRICS they have their own gold</text>
  <text start="421.15" dur="5.73">trading system which again is going to</text>
  <text start="423.88" dur="6.81">be another blow to the Western powers we</text>
  <text start="426.88" dur="6.18">also see that China is creating the belt</text>
  <text start="430.69" dur="5.88">in Road and working very closely with</text>
  <text start="433.06" dur="6.33">the BRIC nations Venezuela well they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="436.57" dur="4.83">embraced China&amp;#39;s petrol you won China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="439.39" dur="3.96">new system to buy all future contracts</text>
  <text start="441.4" dur="4.32">in yuan which can be easily convertible</text>
  <text start="443.35" dur="6.57">to gold at the exchange in Shanghai and</text>
  <text start="445.72" dur="6.72">Hong Kong is now a reality bilateral</text>
  <text start="449.92" dur="5.16">trade between BRICS members and why</text>
  <text start="452.44" dur="6.03">Eurasian partners well they&amp;#39;re dealing</text>
  <text start="455.08" dur="5.43">in local currencies Russia is getting to</text>
  <text start="458.47" dur="5.76">getting ready to release their crypto</text>
  <text start="460.51" dur="6.27">ruble the BRICS well it looks like they</text>
  <text start="464.23" dur="5.4">might be also moving to cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="466.78" dur="5.73">the US dollar is being actively</text>
  <text start="469.63" dur="6.84">challenged by the growing power of the</text>
  <text start="472.51" dur="5.88">Chinese yuan and the BRIC nations and we</text>
  <text start="476.47" dur="3.96">know there&amp;#39;s a lot of other countries</text>
  <text start="478.39" dur="5.88">that have hit that have been hit by</text>
  <text start="480.43" dur="5.82">sanctions including Iran Syria and many</text>
  <text start="484.27" dur="3.69">others and they&amp;#39;re moving away from the</text>
  <text start="486.25" dur="4.23">dollar what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="487.96" dur="5.04">that all these countries they are</text>
  <text start="490.48" dur="5.07">preparing for when the dollar collapses</text>
  <text start="493" dur="4.41">this is why Trump is out there this is</text>
  <text start="495.55" dur="4.5">why he dumped the globalist plan because</text>
  <text start="497.41" dur="5.64">that cannot work TPP has been struck</text>
  <text start="500.05" dur="5.34">down NAFTA&amp;#39;s being renegotiated their</text>
  <text start="503.05" dur="4.98">plans for everything else well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="505.39" dur="4.53">going by the wayside bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="508.03" dur="5.04">agreements just like China is doing is</text>
  <text start="509.92" dur="6.48">happening right now and this all has to</text>
  <text start="513.07" dur="5.159">be done because the system that we&amp;#39;re so</text>
  <text start="516.4" dur="4.44">used to the system that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="518.229" dur="6.031">brainwashed to accept the Fayette</text>
  <text start="520.84" dur="6.33">Federal Reserve System well it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="524.26" dur="6.9">to go bye-bye the central banking system</text>
  <text start="527.17" dur="7.41">is completely obsolete today it is an</text>
  <text start="531.16" dur="6.54">old model and it is no longer viable and</text>
  <text start="534.58" dur="7.32">it was actually never viable they pushed</text>
  <text start="537.7" dur="7.05">their way into the system by paying off</text>
  <text start="541.9" dur="5.82">government officials by bribing others</text>
  <text start="544.75" dur="5.1">and promising them a lot this is why</text>
  <text start="547.72" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s being kept alive for so long</text>
  <text start="549.85" dur="4.68">because the government officials well</text>
  <text start="552.16" dur="4.83">they get free money they get whatever</text>
  <text start="554.53" dur="3.93">they need from the central banking</text>
  <text start="556.99" dur="3.33">community Wall Street that is</text>
  <text start="558.46" dur="3.75">intertwined with the central banking</text>
  <text start="560.32" dur="3.99">community and this is why most of our</text>
  <text start="562.21" dur="3.66">politicians when they go into the White</text>
  <text start="564.31" dur="3.57">House and then when they leave they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="565.87" dur="3.93">very very wealthy and then after they</text>
  <text start="567.88" dur="4.77">leave they&amp;#39;re set up and they make even</text>
  <text start="569.8" dur="5.22">more money now once again what is</text>
  <text start="572.65" dur="5.73">happening here is the entire system is</text>
  <text start="575.02" dur="5.64">being dismantled and it&amp;#39;s happening at</text>
  <text start="578.38" dur="4.86">an accelerated pace and we could see</text>
  <text start="580.66" dur="5.549">right now that the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="583.24" dur="5.31">are screaming and yelling that if this</text>
  <text start="586.209" dur="5.461">continues the system will not be able to</text>
  <text start="588.55" dur="5.279">continue on and you know whoever is</text>
  <text start="591.67" dur="3.449">doing this which is Trump well he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="593.829" dur="3.48">going to be the one that they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="595.119" dur="4.53">have to blame but again I think what</text>
  <text start="597.309" dur="4.47">he&amp;#39;s going to do is turn this around and</text>
  <text start="599.649" dur="5.04">actually blame the central bank because</text>
  <text start="601.779" dur="5.071">there is no reason we need the central</text>
  <text start="604.689" dur="3.81">bank they&amp;#39;re not working for the people</text>
  <text start="606.85" dur="4.44">they don&amp;#39;t do anything for the people it</text>
  <text start="608.499" dur="5.52">is a private corporation and it&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="611.29" dur="4.979">to change as we see many of the larger</text>
  <text start="614.019" dur="5.01">countries that are part of the BRIC</text>
  <text start="616.269" dur="5.73">system they&amp;#39;re looking at cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="619.029" dur="5.881">they&amp;#39;re also looking at this new</text>
  <text start="621.999" dur="5.7">international trade currency now at a</text>
  <text start="624.91" dur="5.039">high level this is what they might use</text>
  <text start="627.699" dur="4.711">between countries but at a low level</text>
  <text start="629.949" dur="6.271">people will most likely use crypto</text>
  <text start="632.41" dur="6.419">currency to purchase their items because</text>
  <text start="636.22" dur="4.529">first of all we have the technology it</text>
  <text start="638.829" dur="4.591">already exists everyone pretty much has</text>
  <text start="640.749" dur="5.791">a phone and everyone knows how to use a</text>
  <text start="643.42" dur="4.709">computer I mean mostly and people can do</text>
  <text start="646.54" dur="3.45">their banking or pay for things just</text>
  <text start="648.129" dur="3.51">like they do today where they go into a</text>
  <text start="649.99" dur="3.389">store they swipe a card all you have to</text>
  <text start="651.639" dur="3.781">do is hold your phone up and guess what</text>
  <text start="653.379" dur="3.81">your cryptocurrency could be transferred</text>
  <text start="655.42" dur="5.039">your cryptocurrency can be deposited</text>
  <text start="657.189" dur="5.281">right into your wallet or any other</text>
