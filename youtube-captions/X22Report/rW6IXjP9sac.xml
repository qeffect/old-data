  <text start="118.37" dur="5.46">doing well everything that they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="120.35" dur="6.72">is working and everyone needs to believe</text>
  <text start="123.83" dur="6.659">in them I mean this is what they want</text>
  <text start="127.07" dur="8.79">everyone to believe but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="130.489" dur="8.731">seeing right now is that no this system</text>
  <text start="135.86" dur="7.62">right now is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="139.22" dur="8.7">and the indicators are showing us that</text>
  <text start="143.48" dur="5.94">this is not a recovery whatsoever out in</text>
  <text start="147.92" dur="3.66">the eurozone they&amp;#39;re trying to make it</text>
  <text start="149.42" dur="4.89">seem like everything is fine we revise</text>
  <text start="151.58" dur="5.79">this number we revise that number and</text>
  <text start="154.31" dur="5.429">now look everything looks great they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="157.37" dur="4.08">even talking about the eurozone housing</text>
  <text start="159.739" dur="3.601">market there saying oh prices have</text>
  <text start="161.45" dur="2.79">recovered a little bit it looks like</text>
  <text start="163.34" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re sustained</text>
  <text start="164.24" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;re subdued so it looks like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="166.67" dur="9.27">in a recovery no the housing market is</text>
  <text start="170.87" dur="11.31">weak it&amp;#39;s not sustainable it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="175.94" dur="7.92">improving its weak it is created just</text>
  <text start="182.18" dur="4.35">like the rest of the private western</text>
  <text start="183.86" dur="6.17">central bank countries to give you the</text>
  <text start="186.53" dur="6.41">illusion that were in this recovery</text>
  <text start="190.03" dur="6.18">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing now is</text>
  <text start="192.94" dur="6.33">corporations they&amp;#39;re laying off</text>
  <text start="196.21" dur="5.74">thousands upon thousands of people if</text>
  <text start="199.27" dur="6.37">all these people are being laid off and</text>
  <text start="201.95" dur="6.68">the unemployment rate continually goes</text>
  <text start="205.64" dur="5.49">up or using their manipulated statistics</text>
  <text start="208.63" dur="7.6">they just don&amp;#39;t count those people and</text>
  <text start="211.13" dur="7.08">their numbers go down we see that things</text>
  <text start="216.23" dur="5.07">aren&amp;#39;t making sense because if the</text>
  <text start="218.21" dur="6.21">numbers truly are going down we would</text>
  <text start="221.3" dur="6.78">see everything expanding everything</text>
  <text start="224.42" dur="5.79">improving with our own eyes you&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="228.08" dur="4.35">able to put a resume out there and get</text>
  <text start="230.21" dur="4.38">that high paying job we&amp;#39;re not seeing</text>
  <text start="232.43" dur="4.92">this whatsoever GE right now is saying</text>
  <text start="234.59" dur="7.47">listen we might move 500 US jobs</text>
  <text start="237.35" dur="9.33">overseas newport news update this is the</text>
  <text start="242.06" dur="7.32">shipbuilding 480 jobs by by los angeles</text>
  <text start="246.68" dur="7.17">times layoffs are coming we know that</text>
  <text start="249.38" dur="7.65">Deutsche Bank unicredit and many others</text>
  <text start="253.85" dur="6.54">are continually laying off thousands</text>
  <text start="257.03" dur="5.61">upon thousands of people now they want</text>
  <text start="260.39" dur="6.29">us to believe that everything is fine in</text>
  <text start="262.64" dur="7.47">the retail market retail sales in August</text>
  <text start="266.68" dur="6.7">came in at a disappointing print of</text>
  <text start="270.11" dur="6.33">point two percent month a month missing</text>
  <text start="273.38" dur="5.28">expectations of point three percent if</text>
  <text start="276.44" dur="6.03">you remove autos its point one percent</text>
  <text start="278.66" dur="6.18">they expected point two percent if you</text>
  <text start="282.47" dur="5.13">remove autos and gas they thought it was</text>
  <text start="284.84" dur="3.72">gonna be 0 point three percent I mean</text>
  <text start="287.6" dur="1.95">they thought it was gonna be point four</text>
  <text start="288.56" dur="4.14">percent it came in at point three</text>
  <text start="289.55" dur="7.2">percent so all of it was a complete mess</text>
  <text start="292.7" dur="5.07">and this drag the year-on-year retail</text>
  <text start="296.75" dur="3.289">sales</text>
  <text start="297.77" dur="6.78">down to a recession looming</text>
  <text start="300.039" dur="6.611">one-point-six percent print now they</text>
  <text start="304.55" dur="5.69">continually tell us that retail is doing</text>
  <text start="306.65" dur="8.07">fine but this one point six percent is</text>
  <text start="310.24" dur="5.98">awful and we&amp;#39;re heading into the holiday</text>
  <text start="314.72" dur="3.24">seasons right now but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="316.22" dur="3.659">interesting about these retail numbers</text>
  <text start="317.96" dur="4.049">is they&amp;#39;re continually telling us that</text>
  <text start="319.879" dur="4.711">housing is in a recovery that everything</text>
  <text start="322.009" dur="4.431">is fine housing prices are continually</text>
  <text start="324.59" dur="4.56">going up except they&amp;#39;re dropping now</text>
  <text start="326.44" dur="5.289">case-shiller already pointed out yet yes</text>
  <text start="329.15" dur="4.44">housing prices have been coming down but</text>
  <text start="331.729" dur="4.651">of course they&amp;#39;re looking back at May</text>
  <text start="333.59" dur="4.799">and June we&amp;#39;re already in September they</text>
  <text start="336.38" dur="3.48">have decreased quite a bit at this point</text>
  <text start="338.389" dur="4.891">so the next report that comes out</text>
  <text start="339.86" dur="6.059">they&amp;#39;re going to refer to what oddest so</text>
  <text start="343.28" dur="5.639">they&amp;#39;re always behind the curve here but</text>
  <text start="345.919" dur="5.4">if housing is improving we should see</text>
  <text start="348.919" dur="5.881">certain things in the market doing very</text>
  <text start="351.319" dur="4.56">well I mean furniture home furnishing</text>
  <text start="354.8" dur="3.06">stores they should be doing well</text>
  <text start="355.879" dur="3.54">building material that should be doing</text>
  <text start="357.86" dur="4.26">fantastic because they continue to tell</text>
  <text start="359.419" dur="5.641">us new new construction is doing</text>
  <text start="362.12" dur="4.38">absolutely awesome but when we look at</text>
  <text start="365.06" dur="3.329">the retail sales for furniture and home</text>
  <text start="366.5" dur="4.349">furnishing stores it&amp;#39;s down negative</text>
  <text start="368.389" dur="5.43">point nine percent when we look at</text>
  <text start="370.849" dur="4.741">building materials and garden suppliers</text>
  <text start="373.819" dur="6.301">where it&amp;#39;s negative one point eight</text>
  <text start="375.59" dur="9.03">percent department stores are down</text>
  <text start="380.12" dur="9.06">negative 0.2% so we can see at this</text>
  <text start="384.62" dur="8.13">point their recovery meme is absolutely</text>
  <text start="389.18" dur="6.049">ridiculous it&amp;#39;s an illusion because we</text>
  <text start="392.75" dur="5.759">would see these numbers increase</text>
  <text start="395.229" dur="5.53">dramatically if we&amp;#39;re truly in a real</text>
  <text start="398.509" dur="4.861">estate recovery if we look back to two</text>
  <text start="400.759" dur="5.071">thousand five to two thousand six going</text>
  <text start="403.37" dur="4.889">into early two thousand seven home</text>
  <text start="405.83" dur="9.03">furnishing building materials were</text>
  <text start="408.259" dur="9.361">skyrocketing because the builders were</text>
  <text start="414.86" dur="5.279">building everywhere home sales were</text>
  <text start="417.62" dur="5.49">increasing people were buying new</text>
  <text start="420.139" dur="5.011">furniture we&amp;#39;re not seeing any of this</text>
  <text start="423.11" dur="4.619">right now we&amp;#39;re seeing none of it</text>
  <text start="425.15" dur="6.51">actually actually we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="427.729" dur="7.171">opposite of what we saw back in 2005</text>
  <text start="431.66" dur="6.39">56 and early two thousand seven what</text>
  <text start="434.9" dur="8.25">we&amp;#39;re seeing now is what we saw in 2008</text>
  <text start="438.05" dur="7.92">and we all know what happened in 2008 we</text>
  <text start="443.15" dur="5.33">see business inventories they are</text>
  <text start="445.97" dur="6.66">growing at the slowest pace since</text>
  <text start="448.48" dur="6.64">January July&amp;#39;s data confirms the</text>
  <text start="452.63" dur="4.47">recession looms large as inventory</text>
  <text start="455.12" dur="9.21">accumulation appears to have hit its</text>
  <text start="457.1" dur="10.11">limit up only 0.1% month on month so we</text>
  <text start="464.33" dur="5.99">can see at this point in time this is</text>
  <text start="467.21" dur="8.04">another indicator showing us that</text>
  <text start="470.32" dur="9.9">something is wrong inventory to sales</text>
  <text start="475.25" dur="12.29">hovers at 1.36 historic recession levels</text>
  <text start="480.22" dur="14.17">we&amp;#39;re at that point Empire manufacturing</text>
  <text start="487.54" dur="10.42">in September negative fourteen point six</text>
  <text start="494.39" dur="9.29">seven hovering at the worst level since</text>
  <text start="497.96" dur="8.79">April of 2009 I mean this is a recovery</text>
  <text start="503.68" dur="5.26">because if this is a recovery I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="506.75" dur="6.2">even imagine what the collapse is going</text>
  <text start="508.94" dur="7.44">to look like the underlying data is a</text>
  <text start="512.95" dur="6.13">total and complete disaster new orders</text>
  <text start="516.38" dur="5.36">remain firmly negative and inventories</text>
  <text start="519.08" dur="5.37">collapse and even more concerning is</text>
  <text start="521.74" dur="5.32">employment and average work week plunged</text>
  <text start="524.45" dur="6.96">into negative territory for the first</text>
  <text start="527.06" dur="8.33">time in over a year it&amp;#39;s all falling</text>
  <text start="531.41" dur="6.93">apart let&amp;#39;s take this a step further</text>
  <text start="535.39" dur="6.01">industrial production missed</text>
  <text start="538.34" dur="4.62">expectations dropping point four percent</text>
  <text start="541.4" dur="4.74">month-on-month this is the sixth of the</text>
  <text start="542.96" dur="7.71">last eight months missing expectations</text>
  <text start="546.14" dur="6.48">of 0 point two percent drop this is the</text>
  <text start="550.67" dur="5.04">biggest month-on-month drop since august</text>
  <text start="552.62" dur="6.72">of 2012 the big driver of the decline</text>
  <text start="555.71" dur="6.66">was auto assemblies which plunged to a</text>
  <text start="559.34" dur="5.749">four-year low by the most since January</text>
  <text start="562.37" dur="9.04">2009 flashing yet and</text>
  <text start="565.089" dur="10.56">another collapse indicator I mean</text>
  <text start="571.41" dur="7.51">manufacturing not doing well all this</text>
  <text start="575.649" dur="5.49">buildup of autos in the dealer lots</text>
  <text start="578.92" dur="6.839">oldest channel stuffing all that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="581.139" dur="12.99">producing people aren&amp;#39;t buying the cars</text>
  <text start="585.759" dur="12.421">and now production is slowing I mean if</text>
  <text start="594.129" dur="7.411">you really think about this we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="598.18" dur="7.62">all of the same signs that we saw back</text>
  <text start="601.54" dur="8.039">in two thousand eight and here we have</text>
  <text start="605.8" dur="6.87">the Fed wrestling with interest rate</text>
  <text start="609.579" dur="5.101">hikes and of course this is why the</text>
  <text start="612.67" dur="4.889">market was doing better because they</text>
  <text start="614.68" dur="5.519">know come this thursday the Fed is going</text>
  <text start="617.559" dur="8.34">to make their decision or no decision at</text>
  <text start="620.199" dur="8.911">all but what happens if the Fed raises</text>
  <text start="625.899" dur="5.37">the interest rates I mean is it going to</text>
  <text start="629.11" dur="5.76">make it better or is it going to make it</text>
  <text start="631.269" dur="6.451">worse I mean if the Fed raises yield</text>
  <text start="634.87" dur="5.809">interest rates in the US that makes the</text>
  <text start="637.72" dur="6.239">US currency the dollar more attractive</text>
  <text start="640.679" dur="4.84">higher yield equals more attractive</text>
  <text start="643.959" dur="4.531">especially when coupled with liquid</text>
  <text start="645.519" dur="5.701">market for us treasuries and the</text>
  <text start="648.49" dur="4.92">relative safety of the dollar what</text>
  <text start="651.22" dur="4.65">happened what happens when the Fed makes</text>
