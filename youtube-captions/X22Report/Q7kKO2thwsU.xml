  <text start="99.82" dur="6.52">anything except the central bank they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="104.24" dur="5.19">the ones who created this system the</text>
  <text start="106.34" dur="6.18">system only lasts for a certain period</text>
  <text start="109.43" dur="5.25">of time then it breaks down when it</text>
  <text start="112.52" dur="4.2">breaks down the central bank normally</text>
  <text start="114.68" dur="4.29">likes to have an event so they can cover</text>
  <text start="116.72" dur="5.009">up what just happened and this way it</text>
  <text start="118.97" dur="6.21">allows them to restart their system the</text>
  <text start="121.729" dur="6.51">problem is they want an event that&amp;#39;s big</text>
  <text start="125.18" dur="6.63">enough to cover all this up that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="128.239" dur="6.601">normally a war instead they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="131.81" dur="5.85">peace how do you cover something up if</text>
  <text start="134.84" dur="5.25">there&amp;#39;s peace everywhere peace with</text>

  <text start="140.09" dur="8.489">peace talks with Syria there&amp;#39;s no event</text>
  <text start="145.75" dur="4.6">so right now the central bank&amp;#39;s they</text>
  <text start="148.579" dur="5.13">realize and they understand and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="150.35" dur="7.35">worried afraid and scared because the</text>
  <text start="153.709" dur="7.731">entire world is slowing down their</text>
  <text start="157.7" dur="7.11">system is buckling under the weight of</text>
  <text start="161.44" dur="5.17">debt it&amp;#39;s all falling apart</text>
  <text start="164.81" dur="6.03">and we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking about that in</text>
  <text start="166.61" dur="7.95">just a bit but let&amp;#39;s turn towards the</text>
  <text start="170.84" dur="6.72">United States we know that the federal</text>
  <text start="174.56" dur="5.399">reserve under the direction of the Trump</text>
  <text start="177.56" dur="7.2">administration the Patriots they have</text>
  <text start="179.959" dur="6.841">stopped raising interest rates and if</text>
  <text start="184.76" dur="3.78">you don&amp;#39;t believe this and you believe</text>
  <text start="186.8" dur="4.2">that the central bank is ready to crash</text>
  <text start="188.54" dur="6.21">the economy they would have continued</text>
  <text start="191" dur="5.52">raising the rates through 2019 they</text>
  <text start="194.75" dur="4.92">wouldn&amp;#39;t have put themselves in a</text>
  <text start="196.52" dur="5.13">holding pattern and actually looking to</text>
  <text start="199.67" dur="3.86">lower interest rates once again because</text>
  <text start="201.65" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s not gonna crash the economy</text>
  <text start="203.53" dur="5.14">raising the interest rates that would</text>
  <text start="206.36" dur="4.55">have crashed the economy we&amp;#39;ve seen it</text>
  <text start="208.67" dur="7.44">before going back in time just look at</text>
  <text start="210.91" dur="7.06">2005 2006 2007 they did just that they</text>
  <text start="216.11" dur="3.42">raised the rates until the system</text>
  <text start="217.97" dur="3.54">buckled under the pressure</text>
  <text start="219.53" dur="4.11">then they started dropping it really</text>
  <text start="221.51" dur="3.15">fast or no one would notice and the</text>
  <text start="223.64" dur="3">whole thing just completely fell apart</text>
  <text start="224.66" dur="4.88">this is what they were trying to do once</text>
  <text start="226.64" dur="5.81">again cue warned us they knew the plan</text>
  <text start="229.54" dur="5.94">2019 they were going to raise rates and</text>
  <text start="232.45" dur="6.849">they were gonna have to have the entire</text>
  <text start="235.48" dur="9.37">system crash in 2020 now they are not</text>
  <text start="239.299" dur="8.581">raising rates in 2019 which means Trump</text>
  <text start="244.85" dur="6.57">the Patriots they are controlling what</text>
  <text start="247.88" dur="6.359">the Fed does but the problem is is that</text>
  <text start="251.42" dur="5.159">the Fed was raising rates before they</text>
  <text start="254.239" dur="3.901">took control and a lot of things started</text>
  <text start="256.579" dur="3.871">a decline very very quickly one of them</text>
  <text start="258.14" dur="4.77">was housing it&amp;#39;s starting to stabilize</text>
  <text start="260.45" dur="6.3">just a little bit but it&amp;#39;s still pretty</text>
  <text start="262.91" dur="6.66">darn bad home prices they&amp;#39;re growing at</text>
  <text start="266.75" dur="3.63">their slowest rate since 2012 existing</text>
  <text start="269.57" dur="3.93">home sales</text>
  <text start="270.38" dur="6.57">they&amp;#39;ve rebounded a little bit but</text>
  <text start="273.5" dur="7.289">pending home sales looks like they have</text>
  <text start="276.95" dur="6.51">slowed quite a bit they fell by 1 1 %</text>
  <text start="280.789" dur="5.401">month on month and if you look over a</text>
  <text start="283.46" dur="5.79">year on your basis you can see pending</text>
  <text start="286.19" dur="5.76">home sales they are in a downward</text>
  <text start="289.25" dur="6.93">trajectory actually 14 months in a row</text>
  <text start="291.95" dur="6.98">and that&amp;#39;s not good so I would expect if</text>
  <text start="296.18" dur="5.13">things start to really fall apart</text>
  <text start="298.93" dur="4.209">Trump is and the Patriots they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="301.31" dur="4.62">tell the Fed listen is what you got to</text>
  <text start="303.139" dur="8.46">do you got to lower the interest rates</text>
  <text start="305.93" dur="8.669">and once that is done people within this</text>
  <text start="311.599" dur="4.681">country they&amp;#39;re gonna be like whoa and</text>
  <text start="314.599" dur="3.511">I&amp;#39;m talking about the investors and talk</text>
  <text start="316.28" dur="5.159">about the speculators I&amp;#39;m talking the</text>
  <text start="318.11" dur="7.399">people that work with debt they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="321.439" dur="7.26">say okay good times are back once again</text>
  <text start="325.509" dur="6.22">now we know that Trump he has been</text>
  <text start="328.699" dur="9.661">manipulating these statistical numbers</text>
  <text start="331.729" dur="9.951">just like Obama Bush Clinton and most</text>
  <text start="338.36" dur="6.809">likely every president before them and</text>
  <text start="341.68" dur="7.75">they had to manipulate the calculations</text>
  <text start="345.169" dur="6.391">why because the Federal Reserve their</text>
  <text start="349.43" dur="5.94">system the central the I should say the</text>
  <text start="351.56" dur="9.659">Rothschild banking system does not work</text>
  <text start="355.37" dur="8.159">well in a real people&amp;#39;s economy if they</text>
  <text start="361.219" dur="4.861">didn&amp;#39;t manipulate any numbers we would</text>
  <text start="363.529" dur="5.13">have something like 18% unemployment</text>
  <text start="366.08" dur="4.86">maybe even a little bit higher if they</text>
  <text start="368.659" dur="5.461">didn&amp;#39;t take control of the stock market</text>
  <text start="370.94" dur="5.659">the stock market would be a complete and</text>
  <text start="374.12" dur="6.269">utter disaster if they didn&amp;#39;t manipulate</text>
  <text start="376.599" dur="7">GDP numbers the GDP numbers would be in</text>
  <text start="380.389" dur="5.31">the negative territory so over time</text>
  <text start="383.599" dur="4.981">because the Federal Reserve System was</text>
  <text start="385.699" dur="3.78">breaking down the economy not just here</text>
  <text start="388.58" dur="3.36">the United Sates but around the world</text>
  <text start="389.479" dur="5.31">has been breaking down they needed to</text>
  <text start="391.94" dur="6.539">manipulate the calculations to make it</text>
  <text start="394.789" dur="4.74">look like everything was fine and this</text>
  <text start="398.479" dur="5.37">is what they&amp;#39;ve been doing for many</text>
  <text start="399.529" dur="9.661">years now Trump has been using this to</text>
  <text start="403.849" dur="6.75">benefit his transition economy now the</text>
  <text start="409.19" dur="2.31">people out there they&amp;#39;re asleep and they</text>
  <text start="410.599" dur="3.99">don&amp;#39;t realize we&amp;#39;re gonna be going</text>
  <text start="411.5" dur="5.31">through a transition what he&amp;#39;s telling</text>
  <text start="414.589" dur="3.75">everyone is that look how great the</text>
  <text start="416.81" dur="3.479">economy&amp;#39;s doing he&amp;#39;s doing this on</text>
  <text start="418.339" dur="4.05">purpose so the mainstream media the dv8</text>
  <text start="420.289" dur="5.701">the central bank can&amp;#39;t say anything</text>
  <text start="422.389" dur="5.941">about it they try but it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="425.99" dur="6.04">difficult because they would then expose</text>
  <text start="428.33" dur="5.14">themselves that they use manipulation in</text>
  <text start="432.03" dur="5.43">so this is why they&amp;#39;re not going to do</text>
  <text start="433.47" dur="6.51">it but Trump tweeted out March 22nd 2019</text>
  <text start="437.46" dur="5.01">that we have three point one percent one</text>
  <text start="439.98" dur="4.44">percent GDP for the year best number in</text>
  <text start="442.47" dur="4.65">14 years and of course what they tried</text>
  <text start="444.42" dur="5.88">to do is they tried to say no that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="447.12" dur="5.85">the GDP number it&amp;#39;s a little bit less</text>
  <text start="450.3" dur="6.15">than that he&amp;#39;s lying blah blah blah blah</text>
  <text start="452.97" dur="5.13">blah but when you look at the numbers</text>
  <text start="456.45" dur="5.49">and you do a little bit of fact-checking</text>
  <text start="458.1" dur="4.38">you can see that yes he is telling the</text>
  <text start="461.94" dur="2.94">truth</text>
  <text start="462.48" dur="4.94">if you compare the fourth quarter of</text>
  <text start="464.88" dur="4.68">2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018 a</text>
  <text start="467.42" dur="5.5">common measure of economic growth for</text>
  <text start="469.56" dur="5.9">the calendar year real GDP grew three</text>
  <text start="472.92" dur="6.3">point one percent the highest rate since</text>
  <text start="475.46" dur="5.29">2005 using an annual average real GDP</text>
  <text start="479.22" dur="4.38">reach two point nine percent in 2018</text>
  <text start="480.75" dur="8.22">tied for the best rate in more than a</text>
  <text start="483.6" dur="8.1">decade so each time he does this he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="488.97" dur="6.26">showing the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="491.7" dur="6.6">bankers he controls the magic wand and</text>
  <text start="495.23" dur="6.7">the economy is going to look better than</text>
  <text start="498.3" dur="6.72">it has ever looked before why because he</text>
  <text start="501.93" dur="5.79">needs to borrow the money why he needs</text>
  <text start="505.02" dur="4.89">to improve the infrastructure he needs</text>
  <text start="507.72" dur="3.96">to use all the weapons against the</text>
  <text start="509.91" dur="5.82">central bank and the deep state so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="511.68" dur="8.46">going to use their funds and rack up the</text>
  <text start="515.73" dur="8.16">debt to bring us into a new economy a</text>
  <text start="520.14" dur="6.21">new economy is forming right now and we</text>
  <text start="523.89" dur="5.24">can see that the talks with China</text>
  <text start="526.35" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re going very well</text>
  <text start="529.13" dur="5.83">US officials are now teasing us that</text>
  <text start="531.84" dur="5.52">they are heralding major concessions</text>
  <text start="534.96" dur="4.83">from Beijing on forced technology</text>
  <text start="537.36" dur="4.92">transfers and a top Chinese official</text>
  <text start="539.79" dur="5.13">told a group of American tech CEOs about</text>
  <text start="542.28" dur="4.7">a proposal to lift restrictions on</text>
  <text start="544.92" dur="3.99">foreign cloud computing companies</text>
  <text start="546.98" dur="3.61">Chinese were talking about forced</text>
  <text start="548.91" dur="4.04">technology transfers in a way they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="550.59" dur="4.98">never wanted to talk about it before</text>
  <text start="552.95" dur="6.25">though differences on IP and</text>
  <text start="555.57" dur="5.7">enforcement&amp;#39;s they still exist but they</text>
  <text start="559.2" dur="5.22">went much further than they have ever</text>
  <text start="561.27" dur="4.56">done before and we can see we&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="564.42" dur="3.15">incredible</text>
  <text start="565.83" dur="4.47">headway with the Chinese right now and</text>
  <text start="567.57" dur="4.98">when it comes to tariffs the US will</text>
  <text start="570.3" dur="4.71">lift some of the tariffs but not all of</text>
  <text start="572.55" dur="4.71">them because they&amp;#39;re going to use the</text>
  <text start="575.01" dur="4.56">other tariffs for leverage and to make</text>
  <text start="577.26" dur="5.61">sure that the Chinese are going to do</text>
  <text start="579.57" dur="6.12">what they&amp;#39;re saying to going to do now</text>
  <text start="582.87" dur="5.43">that is going very well what Trump is</text>
  <text start="585.69" dur="6.96">doing right now he&amp;#39;s preparing the old</text>
  <text start="588.3" dur="6.66">economy for the new economy the old</text>
  <text start="592.65" dur="4.74">economy is a central bank economy the</text>
  <text start="594.96" dur="4.38">new economy is going to be an economy</text>
  <text start="597.39" dur="5.97">without a private western central bank</text>
  <text start="599.34" dur="7.11">without the Rothschilds and Trump needs</text>
  <text start="603.36" dur="5.19">to keep this economy up and running long</text>
  <text start="606.45" dur="4.52">enough so he tweeted out his latest plea</text>
  <text start="608.55" dur="5.19">for OPEC to increase oil production</text>
  <text start="610.97" dur="5.83">saying that oil markets are fragile and</text>
  <text start="613.74" dur="4.8">the price of oil is getting too high now</text>
  <text start="616.8" dur="2.37">why do you think he wants lower oil</text>
  <text start="618.54" dur="3.99">prices</text>
  <text start="619.17" dur="7.97">well businesses thrive with lower oil</text>
  <text start="622.53" dur="9.24">prices FedEx UPS DHL the post office</text>
  <text start="627.14" dur="7.45">airlines lower oil prices lower fuel</text>
  <text start="631.77" dur="5.04">prices means more profits for companies</text>
  <text start="634.59" dur="6.42">keeps the economy running and he needs</text>
  <text start="636.81" dur="6.93">to do this past 2020 long enough to</text>
  <text start="641.01" dur="5.31">bring us into a new economic system and</text>
  <text start="643.74" dur="5.91">the central bankers they&amp;#39;re vulnerable</text>
  <text start="646.32" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re panicking right now the IMF is</text>
  <text start="649.65" dur="4.47">warning the eurozone will narrow and</text>
  <text start="651.18" dur="4.62">remember here in the United States the</text>
  <text start="654.12" dur="4.59">United States as a printing press the</text>
  <text start="655.8" dur="5.19">central bank the Federal Reserve creates</text>
  <text start="658.71" dur="5.28">the currency the US government borrows</text>
  <text start="660.99" dur="5.34">it and those in power can say listen</text>
  <text start="663.99" dur="5.09">create more currency we need it we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="666.33" dur="6.39">gonna borrow some more in the in Europe</text>
  <text start="669.08" dur="5.71">there&amp;#39;s the ECB but there&amp;#39;s many many</text>
  <text start="672.72" dur="5.1">countries under the ECB where they loan</text>
  <text start="674.79" dur="5.49">these funds to these countries each</text>
  <text start="677.82" dur="5.58">country doesn&amp;#39;t have their own printing</text>
  <text start="680.28" dur="6.36">press that&amp;#39;s a very big difference the</text>
  <text start="683.4" dur="5.88">eurozone they&amp;#39;ve been following the lead</text>
  <text start="686.64" dur="4.23">of the central bank of the Fed because</text>
  <text start="689.28" dur="3.33">they are the reserve currency of the</text>
  <text start="690.87" dur="4.56">world and they were preparing to bring</text>
  <text start="692.61" dur="6.57">down the entire economic system the</text>
  <text start="695.43" dur="6.54">problem is is that they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="699.18" dur="7.02">under their control anymore so what does</text>
  <text start="701.97" dur="6.42">the ECB do what does the IMF do well</text>
  <text start="706.2" dur="4.62">they start to worry they start to panic</text>
  <text start="708.39" dur="4.02">and we see Christine Lagarde is out</text>

  <text start="715.17" dur="5.1">worrying about the banks in Europe that</text>
  <text start="717.45" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re not resilient enough to handle a</text>
  <text start="720.27" dur="4.77">potential future shock why are they so</text>
  <text start="722.73" dur="5.67">worried about a potential future shock</text>
  <text start="725.04" dur="5.1">because they know that this economy is</text>
  <text start="728.4" dur="4.41">going to crash and burn</text>
  <text start="730.14" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s their economy they know exactly</text>
  <text start="732.81" dur="3.9">what&amp;#39;s going to happen they know that</text>
  <text start="734.85" dur="4.71">their economy doesn&amp;#39;t last that long</text>
  <text start="736.71" dur="5.13">and they&amp;#39;re saying something needs to be</text>
  <text start="739.56" dur="4.44">done and of course they&amp;#39;re saying oh the</text>
  <text start="741.84" dur="6.03">banking system it&amp;#39;s safer than it ever</text>
  <text start="744" dur="5.43">was but not safe enough well that really</text>
  <text start="747.87" dur="5.46">means let me translate that for you is</text>
  <text start="749.43" dur="6.87">that we never expected this to happen we</text>
  <text start="753.33" dur="6.87">thought the Federal Reserve through the</text>
  <text start="756.3" dur="6.27">ECB we&amp;#39;re both going to raise the rates</text>
  <text start="760.2" dur="4.29">bring the economy down we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="762.57" dur="4.5">have an event and it was gonna cover all</text>
  <text start="764.49" dur="6.54">this up we don&amp;#39;t have any of that and we</text>
  <text start="767.07" dur="6.21">lost the Fed now we&amp;#39;re worried because</text>
  <text start="771.03" dur="5.52">when the economy breaks down and falls</text>
  <text start="773.28" dur="6.69">apart the entire European banking system</text>
  <text start="776.55" dur="6">is going to implode so what do they want</text>
  <text start="779.97" dur="6.15">to do they went up they want to set up</text>
  <text start="782.55" dur="7.74">some type of Insurance Scheme to protect</text>
  <text start="786.12" dur="9.03">the banks now let&amp;#39;s think about this for</text>
  <text start="790.29" dur="7.95">a second they created bail in documents</text>
  <text start="795.15" dur="5.76">a while back which says they can go into</text>
  <text start="798.24" dur="4.83">everyone&amp;#39;s account and use those funds</text>
  <text start="800.91" dur="5.72">to protect the banks because they</text>
  <text start="803.07" dur="6.57">realize that governments are no longer</text>
  <text start="806.63" dur="7.12">going to bail them out that&amp;#39;s off the</text>
  <text start="809.64" dur="6.42">table so they&amp;#39;re looking for a way to</text>
  <text start="813.75" dur="4.02">protect the banks because they know the</text>
  <text start="816.06" dur="4.26">banks are not solid they know the banks</text>
  <text start="817.77" dur="6.06">are to go down and if the banks go down</text>
  <text start="820.32" dur="6.54">their system goes down so they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="823.83" dur="5.18">to create this Insurance Scheme where</text>
  <text start="826.86" dur="4.789">countries and it&amp;#39;s called the European</text>
  <text start="829.01" dur="5.46">Deposit Insurance Scheme or</text>

  <text start="843.97" dur="5.469">Netherlands and other northern countries</text>
  <text start="847.129" dur="5.281">they&amp;#39;re a little bit worried because</text>
  <text start="849.439" dur="5.221">they&amp;#39;re afraid that when everything</text>
  <text start="852.41" dur="5.429">falls apart they&amp;#39;re going to be on the</text>
  <text start="854.66" dur="5.909">hook for the repayment of deposits in</text>
  <text start="857.839" dur="5.85">countries like Italy Greece Portugal</text>
  <text start="860.569" dur="6.87">where banks are more burdened by bad</text>
  <text start="863.689" dur="6.84">loans so they don&amp;#39;t know how to get out</text>
  <text start="867.439" dur="5.4">of this and they&amp;#39;re worried they&amp;#39;re</text>
