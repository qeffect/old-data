  <text start="123.32" dur="6.479">any benefit to the people no and this is</text>
  <text start="125.899" dur="6.241">what these individuals in our government</text>
  <text start="129.799" dur="4.051">need to understand they are working for</text>

  <text start="133.85" dur="3.69">insurance company they&amp;#39;re not working</text>

  <text start="165.56" dur="4.83">because all they&amp;#39;re doing is taking what</text>
  <text start="168.17" dur="3.33">already exists and just changing it</text>
  <text start="170.39" dur="3.33">around a little bit and changing the</text>
  <text start="171.5" dur="4.739">name and this is what they come up with</text>
  <text start="173.72" dur="5.64">after seven years of complaining about</text>
  <text start="176.239" dur="6.091">it this is ridiculous they might as well</text>
  <text start="179.36" dur="5.88">just scrap the entire thing get rid</text>
  <text start="182.33" dur="5.49">of Obamacare and let the insurance</text>
  <text start="185.24" dur="5.52">companies compete until they can figure</text>
  <text start="187.82" dur="4.68">out what we need and how it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="190.76" dur="3.75">benefit the people get rid of the</text>
  <text start="192.5" dur="4.14">insurance companies they shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="194.51" dur="4.65">involved in this because they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="196.64" dur="4.44">tell you what they want get the people</text>
  <text start="199.16" dur="3.3">together and make something that works</text>
  <text start="201.08" dur="3.54">for the people and guess who&amp;#39;s gonna get</text>
  <text start="202.46" dur="5.01">hurt yes the insurance companies they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="204.62" dur="4.92">gonna have to pay because again this is</text>
  <text start="207.47" dur="4.26">for the people not for the insurance</text>
  <text start="209.54" dur="5.61">companies now we can see the whole</text>
  <text start="211.73" dur="6.06">entire scandal of the masking unmasking</text>
  <text start="215.15" dur="4.92">the spine well it is really starting to</text>
  <text start="217.79" dur="4.65">heat up now the deep state is very</text>
  <text start="220.07" dur="5.58">nervous about what&amp;#39;s going on and the</text>
  <text start="222.44" dur="5.64">individual that broke the story is Serna</text>
  <text start="225.65" dur="4.98">vich and he is out there and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="228.08" dur="4.14">that well he really didn&amp;#39;t have to have</text>
  <text start="230.63" dur="4.2">a deep throat he didn&amp;#39;t eat anything</text>
  <text start="232.22" dur="4.08">like that because his sources for the</text>
  <text start="234.83" dur="3.57">Susan Rice story were actually folks</text>
  <text start="236.3" dur="4.98">working at Bloomberg and the New York</text>
  <text start="238.4" dur="5.22">Times who revealed that both Eli Lake</text>
  <text start="241.28" dur="5.31">from Bloomberg and Maggie Haberman from</text>
  <text start="243.62" dur="5.82">the New York Times were sitting on the</text>
  <text start="246.59" dur="6.24">Susan Rice story in order to protect the</text>
  <text start="249.44" dur="5.519">Obama administration Maggie Haberman had</text>
  <text start="252.83" dur="4.56">it she will not run any articles that</text>
  <text start="254.959" dur="6.571">are critical of the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="257.39" dur="6.75">Eli had it and that&amp;#39;s Eli Lake he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="261.53" dur="4.71">want to run it and Bloomberg didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="264.14" dur="3.84">to run it because it vindicates Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="266.24" dur="4.91">claim that he had been spied upon and</text>
  <text start="267.98" dur="6.9">Eli Lake is is they never Trumper</text>
  <text start="271.15" dur="6.93">Bloomberg was a never Trump publication</text>
  <text start="274.88" dur="6.09">I thought the corporate media</text>
  <text start="278.08" dur="4.9">journalists were supposed to be unbiased</text>
  <text start="280.97" dur="4.32">they were supposed to investigate</text>
  <text start="282.98" dur="4.499">stories and they were supposed to find</text>
  <text start="285.29" dur="3.72">out the truth and it looks like and</text>
  <text start="287.479" dur="4.141">we&amp;#39;ve known this for a very long time</text>
  <text start="289.01" dur="5.34">let&amp;#39;s not be foolish about this the</text>
  <text start="291.62" dur="5.67">corporate media well they are controlled</text>
  <text start="294.35" dur="4.41">by the deep state and now we have a lot</text>
  <text start="297.29" dur="5.46">of evidence that is coming out right now</text>
  <text start="298.76" dur="6.93">and it&amp;#39;s showing that Susan Rice most</text>
  <text start="302.75" dur="5.34">likely is the individual that unmasked</text>
  <text start="305.69" dur="6.539">the individuals in the Trump team and</text>
  <text start="308.09" dur="8.1">Obama was spying on the Trump team US</text>
  <text start="312.229" dur="6.541">attorney Joseph Genova suggested that</text>
  <text start="316.19" dur="5.37">specifically requested that the NSA</text>
  <text start="318.77" dur="3.36">provide her with detailed spreadsheets</text>
  <text start="321.56" dur="2.79">of</text>
  <text start="322.13" dur="5.37">intercepted phone calls with unmasked</text>
  <text start="324.35" dur="4.32">Trump associates and what was produced</text>
  <text start="327.5" dur="3.45">by the intelligence community at the</text>
  <text start="328.67" dur="4.8">request of Miss Rice were detailed</text>
  <text start="330.95" dur="5.04">spreadsheets of the intercepted phone</text>
  <text start="333.47" dur="5.67">calls and the individuals were unmasked</text>
  <text start="335.99" dur="5.52">and we could see right now that the</text>
  <text start="339.14" dur="3.93">Obama administration was utilizing the</text>
  <text start="341.51" dur="4.14">full force of the US intelligence</text>
  <text start="343.07" dur="5.13">apparatus to take down a political</text>
  <text start="345.65" dur="5.88">adversary and this is why Obama changed</text>
  <text start="348.2" dur="6.81">the rules at the last minute so he had</text>
  <text start="351.53" dur="5.07">the ability to do all this now CNN the</text>
  <text start="355.01" dur="3.33">New York Times the rest of the corporate</text>
  <text start="356.6" dur="4.32">media you would think this would be</text>
  <text start="358.34" dur="4.8">front-page news but guess what</text>
  <text start="360.92" dur="5.76">it isn&amp;#39;t they&amp;#39;re still pushing the idea</text>
  <text start="363.14" dur="7.35">of Trump and Russia working together</text>
  <text start="366.68" dur="5.76">where I saw on that on the page of CNN</text>
  <text start="370.49" dur="4.23">they were saying that where&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="372.44" dur="4.71">where there&amp;#39;s smoke there&amp;#39;s fire look at</text>
  <text start="374.72" dur="5.28">Russia look at Trump and we can see</text>
  <text start="377.15" dur="5.73">right now Don Lemon from CNN he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="380" dur="5.52">that hey I&amp;#39;m just going to ignore this</text>
  <text start="382.88" dur="5.07">story now when somebody says that who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="385.52" dur="5.01">in a news organization who&amp;#39;s supposed to</text>
  <text start="387.95" dur="5.85">be a journalist this tells you something</text>
  <text start="390.53" dur="5.46">is very very wrong and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="393.8" dur="5.16">bury this and they&amp;#39;re out there trying</text>
  <text start="395.99" dur="6.27">to tell everyone that this story is fake</text>
  <text start="398.96" dur="6.15">there is no evidence but as a journalist</text>
  <text start="402.26" dur="5.79">what is backing up their claims because</text>
  <text start="405.11" dur="6.48">we know right now that there&amp;#39;s a paper</text>
  <text start="408.05" dur="6">trail and Trump has the paper trail we</text>
  <text start="411.59" dur="5.1">see that Senator Rand Paul said that</text>
  <text start="414.05" dur="4.86">rice should testify under oath to</text>
  <text start="416.69" dur="4.92">address multiple reports she had unmask</text>
  <text start="418.91" dur="4.44">the identities of Americans and yes this</text>
  <text start="421.61" dur="4.11">is what she should be doing now think</text>
  <text start="423.35" dur="6">about all of this all this is going on</text>
  <text start="425.72" dur="5.31">where is the FBI because right now trey</text>
  <text start="429.35" dur="4.83">Gowdy during the hearing said was there</text>
  <text start="431.03" dur="5.639">a crime committed yes these people that</text>
  <text start="434.18" dur="4.17">we know of these hundred people have the</text>
  <text start="436.669" dur="3.961">ability to unmask these individuals so</text>
  <text start="438.35" dur="4.92">this is a crime and those penalties for</text>
  <text start="440.63" dur="5.07">that are you investigating no so the FBI</text>
  <text start="443.27" dur="4.05">is controlled by the deep state I mean</text>
  <text start="445.7" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re telegraphing it they&amp;#39;re letting</text>
  <text start="447.32" dur="2.73">us know that this is what&amp;#39;s happening so</text>
  <text start="449.24" dur="4.049">the Obama</text>
  <text start="450.05" dur="5.88">administration most likely is involved</text>
  <text start="453.289" dur="5.94">in this of course and we could see right</text>
  <text start="455.93" dur="5.16">now that Susan Rice responded to Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="459.229" dur="3.361">allegations and she&amp;#39;s saying that I</text>
  <text start="461.09" dur="4.819">didn&amp;#39;t do anything wrong</text>
  <text start="462.59" dur="6.449">well she did do certain things wrong and</text>
  <text start="465.909" dur="5.44">she was on an interview with MSNBC</text>
  <text start="469.039" dur="4.801">with Andrea Mitchell and she was</text>
  <text start="471.349" dur="4.591">explaining you know how this all came</text>
  <text start="473.84" dur="5.009">about and how she has the ability to</text>
  <text start="475.94" dur="6.08">unmask but this was all part of the</text>
  <text start="478.849" dur="5.79">intelligence gathering and we know from</text>
  <text start="482.02" dur="5.079">Evelyn Farkas we know from another</text>
  <text start="484.639" dur="4.951">Democrat that came forward that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="487.099" dur="3.961">all saying the same exact thing yes they</text>
  <text start="489.59" dur="4.079">slip up and so other people are just</text>
  <text start="491.06" dur="5.55">telling the truth that Obama was spying</text>
  <text start="493.669" dur="5.671">one way or another on Trump and many</text>
  <text start="496.61" dur="6.149">other individuals and she went on to say</text>
  <text start="499.34" dur="5.789">that I received those reports as did</text>
  <text start="502.759" dur="4.56">other officials and there were occasions</text>
  <text start="505.129" dur="6.391">when I would receive a report in which a</text>
  <text start="507.319" dur="7.71">u.s. person was referred to name not</text>
  <text start="511.52" dur="5.699">provided just us person and sometimes in</text>
  <text start="515.029" dur="4.861">that context in order to understand the</text>
  <text start="517.219" dur="5.521">importance in the report and to assess</text>
  <text start="519.89" dur="6.509">its significance it was necessary to</text>
  <text start="522.74" dur="5.13">find out or request who that US official</text>
  <text start="526.399" dur="5.851">was we&amp;#39;ll wait a minute</text>
  <text start="527.87" dur="6.959">so she did unmask now she just admitted</text>
  <text start="532.25" dur="4.62">it when she said this now the question</text>
  <text start="534.829" dur="3.211">is we need to take it to the next level</text>
  <text start="536.87" dur="4.08">and there needs to be an investigation</text>
  <text start="538.04" dur="4.2">you would think Pelosi Schiff and all</text>
  <text start="540.95" dur="2.46">these other individuals will be out</text>
  <text start="542.24" dur="2.789">there saying there has to be an</text>
  <text start="543.41" dur="4.44">investigation because we have real</text>
  <text start="545.029" dur="4.62">evidence here so she actually admitted</text>
  <text start="547.85" dur="5.01">that sometimes that yes she has to</text>
  <text start="549.649" dur="6.901">unmask these people so she&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="552.86" dur="6.96">she did do this before now the question</text>
  <text start="556.55" dur="5.31">is did she unmask it during this period</text>
  <text start="559.82" dur="4.079">of time and this is why there needs to</text>
  <text start="561.86" dur="4.349">be an investigation this is why they</text>
  <text start="563.899" dur="5.13">need her to testify so right now the</text>
  <text start="566.209" dur="5.94">house intelligence panel has asked Susan</text>
  <text start="569.029" dur="5.641">Rice to testify supposedly under oath</text>
  <text start="572.149" dur="5.011">now the question the next question on</text>
  <text start="574.67" dur="3">everyone&amp;#39;s lips is will she plead the</text>
  <text start="577.16" dur="4.2">fifth</text>
  <text start="577.67" dur="5.43">now we know right now that she said some</text>
  <text start="581.36" dur="2.64">damaging things during the interview</text>
  <text start="583.1" dur="3.99">just</text>
  <text start="584" dur="5.73">like Evelyn Farkas and we see right now</text>
  <text start="587.09" dur="6.81">that she will be called to testify and</text>
  <text start="589.73" dur="5.73">we will know right away if she&amp;#39;s hiding</text>
  <text start="593.9" dur="3.6">something because we all know most</text>
  <text start="595.46" dur="3.75">likely she&amp;#39;s gonna plead the fifth now</text>
  <text start="597.5" dur="2.49">if she does testify and she doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="599.21" dur="2.94">plead the fifth</text>
  <text start="599.99" dur="4.7">well they&amp;#39;re gonna get to the bottom of</text>
  <text start="602.15" dur="5.34">this and this whole thing is going to be</text>
  <text start="604.69" dur="5.17">unraveling right in front of her eyes so</text>
  <text start="607.49" dur="4.83">the question is since the deep state</text>
  <text start="609.86" dur="4.5">realizes what&amp;#39;s going on that this truth</text>
  <text start="612.32" dur="3.57">is coming out one way or another the</text>
  <text start="614.36" dur="3.72">corporate media could pretend and ignore</text>
  <text start="615.89" dur="5.37">it all they want but what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="618.08" dur="6.81">right now is they&amp;#39;re losing the fight on</text>
  <text start="621.26" dur="5.46">this one and the deep state they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="624.89" dur="3.57">let this go any further so what do they</text>
  <text start="626.72" dur="3.36">do well they have a couple of options</text>
  <text start="628.46" dur="3.84">they can get rid of Trump they can</text>
  <text start="630.08" dur="4.17">assassinate them that might be a little</text>
  <text start="632.3" dur="3.96">too early in the game because people</text>
  <text start="634.25" dur="3.93">would scream and yell and say okay we</text>
  <text start="636.26" dur="4.62">knew this was coming you did exactly</text>
  <text start="638.18" dur="5.16">what we thought or they can create</text>
  <text start="640.88" dur="5.25">events which we are seeing right now the</text>

  <text start="646.13" dur="6.75">attack in Saint Petersburg the chemical</text>
  <text start="649.76" dur="4.89">weapons attack in Syria and we can see</text>
  <text start="652.88" dur="4.23">that to really distract this they need a</text>
  <text start="654.65" dur="4.62">real good wag the dog type of</text>
  <text start="657.11" dur="3.99">distraction so I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised</text>
  <text start="659.27" dur="4.38">if they&amp;#39;re coming up with something</text>
  <text start="661.1" dur="5.34">really big to distract from all of this</text>
  <text start="663.65" dur="5.28">so this is completely dropped now one</text>
  <text start="666.44" dur="6.51">way to do this is to collapse the</text>
  <text start="668.93" dur="6.78">economy and have a terrorist group or a</text>
  <text start="672.95" dur="4.59">country attack the United States or make</text>
  <text start="675.71" dur="3.39">it look like they&amp;#39;re attacking because</text>
  <text start="677.54" dur="3.75">then this would bring the nation</text>
  <text start="679.1" dur="4.23">together it would keep the White House</text>
  <text start="681.29" dur="5.13">completely busy this would be off the</text>

  <text start="778.509" dur="5.08">we could see that they want him out of</text>

  <text start="783.589" dur="4.47">that were protesting about this but all</text>
  <text start="785.869" dur="4.981">these protestors were sponsored by Soros</text>
  <text start="788.059" dur="5.34">this is how this man works he goes out</text>

  <text start="818.029" dur="5.97">this for sure you know how difficult it</text>
  <text start="819.949" dur="6.24">is to find a state actor and secondly we</text>
  <text start="823.999" dur="4.32">know that North Korea at this point well</text>
  <text start="826.189" dur="4.71">they really didn&amp;#39;t hack into Sony they</text>
  <text start="828.319" dur="5.37">didn&amp;#39;t hack into anything else this has</text>
  <text start="830.899" dur="4.95">been created and it has been put out</text>
  <text start="833.689" dur="4.5">there by the intelligence agencies we</text>

  <text start="851" dur="5.04">their own IP address that would just be</text>
  <text start="852.83" dur="5.34">really ridiculous we see Russia right</text>
  <text start="856.04" dur="4.47">now they are deploying more planes to</text>
  <text start="858.17" dur="5.16">Eastern military districts in response</text>
  <text start="860.51" dur="5.55">to us drills they have make thirty ones</text>
  <text start="863.33" dur="4.86">make thirty one BM interceptor jets that</text>
  <text start="866.06" dur="4.71">took part of the large-scale drills and</text>
  <text start="868.19" dur="3.48">this is all being done because we could</text>
  <text start="870.77" dur="2.88">see what the United States government</text>
  <text start="871.67" dur="3.81">central bankers are doing they are</text>
  <text start="873.65" dur="4.35">prepping for war they have been prepping</text>
  <text start="875.48" dur="4.2">for war for many years now this is why</text>
  <text start="878" dur="4.95">all military assets troops have been</text>
  <text start="879.68" dur="4.92">moved into certain locations and we can</text>
  <text start="882.95" dur="4.53">see right now they are pushing their</text>
  <text start="884.6" dur="4.41">agenda we see erawan is out there he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="887.48" dur="4.95">saying that he&amp;#39;s planning a new</text>
  <text start="889.01" dur="5.49">operation since your eighties shield has</text>
  <text start="892.43" dur="4.8">ended they&amp;#39;re starting a new one right</text>
  <text start="894.5" dur="7.68">now now there is a problem with this</text>
  <text start="897.23" dur="7.53">because Syria wants the ability to now</text>
  <text start="902.18" dur="4.65">say yes you can fight in Syria now you</text>
  <text start="904.76" dur="3.99">cannot fight in Syria before turkey just</text>
  <text start="906.83" dur="3.78">came in and did whatever they want now</text>
  <text start="908.75" dur="4.65">Russia and Syria saying to Turkey listen</text>
  <text start="910.61" dur="5.22">you need to get the consensus from the</text>
  <text start="913.4" dur="4.83">Syrian government from Assad to go ahead</text>
  <text start="915.83" dur="4.44">and do what you&amp;#39;re going to do and most</text>
  <text start="918.23" dur="3.6">likely I think Assad and Russia should</text>
  <text start="920.27" dur="3.45">be kicking out the United States should</text>
  <text start="921.83" dur="4.08">be kicking out Turkey and let them</text>
  <text start="923.72" dur="4.26">handle their own business in there why</text>
  <text start="925.91" dur="4.44">is the United States the coalition first</text>
  <text start="927.98" dur="5.07">forces turkey in there to fight</text>
  <text start="930.35" dur="4.62">terrorism because if we had the Islamic</text>

  <text start="934.97" dur="4.26">by the United States government</text>
  <text start="935.95" dur="5.98">intelligent agency and the coalition</text>
  <text start="939.23" dur="5.28">forces Mossad mi6 but let&amp;#39;s just use</text>
  <text start="941.93" dur="4.14">this as an example if there was the</text>
  <text start="944.51" dur="3.42">Islamic state running around let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="946.07" dur="5.1">in the state of Texas or North Carolina</text>
  <text start="947.93" dur="5.52">any place would we allow Syria just to</text>
  <text start="951.17" dur="3.87">come in and say hey we&amp;#39;re helping you</text>
  <text start="953.45" dur="3.99">out we&amp;#39;re just fighting the terrorism</text>
  <text start="955.04" dur="4.799">the terrorists in the in this area know</text>
  <text start="957.44" dur="4.32">this would not be allowed this would be</text>
  <text start="959.839" dur="3.481">called invasion and this is what the</text>
  <text start="961.76" dur="4.86">United States is doing what Syria right</text>

  <text start="1296.33" dur="4.02">al-qaeda which is funded by the United</text>

  <text start="1305.27" dur="6.42">the hospital he had time to take videos</text>
  <text start="1308.42" dur="5.4">of what was going on meanwhile when you</text>

  <text start="1350.24" dur="5.07">dealing with a sarin gas attack so</text>
  <text start="1353.63" dur="3.78">something is wrong here</text>
  <text start="1355.31" dur="5.31">and we could see already with McCain</text>
  <text start="1357.41" dur="5.25">with Graham saying that we need to go</text>

  <text start="1387.559" dur="7.441">media by the Intel agencies and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1390.86" dur="7.53">trying to force the entire situation in</text>
