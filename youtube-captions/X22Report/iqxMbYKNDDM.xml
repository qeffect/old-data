  <text start="88.33" dur="5.61">UK and I know the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="91.36" dur="4.619">out there saying that Boris Johnson is a</text>
  <text start="93.94" dur="2.429">bumbling fool he has no idea what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="95.979" dur="5.851">doing</text>

  <text start="121.09" dur="8.75">that is made to stay or leave and what</text>
  <text start="126.039" dur="8.881">they&amp;#39;re saying is that the UK economy</text>
  <text start="129.84" dur="8.59">once they leave the EU it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="134.92" dur="6.27">a disaster it&amp;#39;s going to cost the UK</text>
  <text start="138.43" dur="4.199">about 90 billion and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="141.19" dur="3.57">the National Institute of Economic and</text>
  <text start="142.629" dur="5.071">Social Research and this is one of the</text>
  <text start="144.76" dur="4.68">UK&amp;#39;s leading economic think tanks the</text>
  <text start="147.7" dur="2.75">think tank is suggested by the end of</text>
  <text start="149.44" dur="3.12">2020</text>
  <text start="150.45" dur="4.75">Johnson&amp;#39;s agreement if accepted would</text>
  <text start="152.56" dur="8.64">axe the size of the country&amp;#39;s economy up</text>
  <text start="155.2" dur="7.47">to 4% or about 1400 per capita a year</text>
  <text start="161.2" dur="3.899">now why do you think they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="162.67" dur="5.64">why do you think they&amp;#39;re pushing the</text>
  <text start="165.099" dur="6.481">fear-mongering out to the public because</text>
  <text start="168.31" dur="6.78">they know what&amp;#39;s going to happen Boris</text>
  <text start="171.58" dur="6.81">Johnson right now he accepted the brexit</text>
  <text start="175.09" dur="7.34">extension that was offered to him for</text>
  <text start="178.39" dur="8.76">January 31st but the extension is</text>
  <text start="182.43" dur="8.95">meaningless the January 31st extension</text>
  <text start="187.15" dur="7.559">is completely moot if there is an</text>
  <text start="191.38" dur="4.98">election in December and it seems that</text>
  <text start="194.709" dur="2.761">there&amp;#39;s going to be an election in</text>
  <text start="196.36" dur="3.78">December</text>
  <text start="197.47" dur="5.67">now MPs voted in favor of a December</text>
  <text start="200.14" dur="8.159">12th date by a margin of 438 to 20 a</text>
  <text start="203.14" dur="7.53">majority of about 418 so the Liberal</text>
  <text start="208.299" dur="5.94">Democrats wanted a December 9th election</text>
  <text start="210.67" dur="5.01">so did labour not that Labour really</text>
  <text start="214.239" dur="3.481">wanted an election they just went along</text>
  <text start="215.68" dur="5.04">with it pretending that they wanted this</text>
  <text start="217.72" dur="4.71">election the significance of a December</text>
  <text start="220.72" dur="4.23">12th is at the college students who are</text>
  <text start="222.43" dur="5.07">likely registered to vote near districts</text>
  <text start="224.95" dur="5.759">close to their schools may not vote at</text>
  <text start="227.5" dur="6.51">all since they&amp;#39;ll be on recess that was</text>
  <text start="230.709" dur="5.761">a win for Johnson the amendment to allow</text>
  <text start="234.01" dur="4.319">16 and 17-year olds to vote was struck</text>
  <text start="236.47" dur="5.34">down when Johnson threatened not to</text>
  <text start="238.329" dur="5.731">offer December elections at all was also</text>
  <text start="241.81" dur="5.04">a major win for Johnson those who</text>
  <text start="244.06" dur="6.049">suggested Johnson caved in by agreeing</text>
  <text start="246.85" dur="7.59">to an extension to January 31st missed</text>
  <text start="250.109" dur="7.711">what he was doing here Johnson got</text>
  <text start="254.44" dur="6.53">exactly what he wanted an early election</text>
  <text start="257.82" dur="5.92">when he is way ahead in the polls</text>
  <text start="260.97" dur="8.71">Johnson even phoned macron telling him</text>
  <text start="263.74" dur="7.86">to okay an extension Johnson was opposed</text>
  <text start="269.68" dur="5.34">to an extension at least that&amp;#39;s what he</text>
  <text start="271.6" dur="6.96">said and he was if there was no election</text>
  <text start="275.02" dur="7.32">attached to it Johnson colluded with</text>
  <text start="278.56" dur="5.85">McCrone who demanded a way forward the</text>
  <text start="282.34" dur="4.32">way forward meant either elections or</text>
  <text start="284.41" dur="4.56">passage of the withdrawal agreement the</text>
  <text start="286.66" dur="5.249">w.a had the Liberal Democrats scared to</text>
  <text start="288.97" dur="5.009">death Johnson is so far ahead in the</text>
  <text start="291.909" dur="2.901">polls that he would rather gamble on</text>
  <text start="293.979" dur="3.201">elections be</text>
  <text start="294.81" dur="4.98">or The Witcher all groomin is settled</text>
  <text start="297.18" dur="6.9">and what about the No Deal well the no</text>
  <text start="299.79" dur="7.86">deals back in play Johnson wants a deal</text>
  <text start="304.08" dur="5.7">but if the elections are such that he</text>
  <text start="307.65" dur="5.57">needs cooperation from the DUP to</text>
  <text start="309.78" dur="6.03">achieve brexit then expect a No Deal</text>
  <text start="313.22" dur="6.19">everyone seemed to underestimate what</text>
  <text start="315.81" dur="5.22">Johnson was doing here they thought they</text>
  <text start="319.41" dur="4.65">had this the mainstream media was out</text>
  <text start="321.03" dur="5.4">there the politicians were out there</text>
  <text start="324.06" dur="4.65">saying that Johnson has no clue what</text>
  <text start="326.43" dur="5.01">he&amp;#39;s doing and they thought that he was</text>
  <text start="328.71" dur="6.75">just agreeing with all of this for the</text>
  <text start="331.44" dur="7.44">extension but he played them all that</text>
  <text start="335.46" dur="7.29">remains is an election to prove all of</text>
  <text start="338.88" dur="7.71">this and right now Johnson is way way</text>
  <text start="342.75" dur="5.45">ahead in the polls and it seems he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="346.59" dur="5.549">going to get his way</text>
  <text start="348.2" dur="5.49">the Patriots they&amp;#39;re fully in control of</text>
  <text start="352.139" dur="4.831">the situation</text>
  <text start="353.69" dur="7">now here in the United States we see</text>
  <text start="356.97" dur="5.67">buek the US economy is moving along</text>
  <text start="360.69" dur="4.349">right now now it&amp;#39;s slowed in the third</text>
  <text start="362.64" dur="5.43">quarter but growth continued thanks to</text>
  <text start="365.039" dur="5.94">strong consumer spending which offset</text>
  <text start="368.07" dur="4.86">the drag of some of these business</text>
  <text start="370.979" dur="5.221">investments that aren&amp;#39;t doing that well</text>
  <text start="372.93" dur="4.65">and the gross domestic product which is</text>
  <text start="376.2" dur="4.219">a broad measure of goods and services</text>
  <text start="377.58" dur="5.49">produced across the economy rose at a</text>
  <text start="380.419" dur="5.321">1.9 percent annual rate in the third</text>
  <text start="383.07" dur="4.71">quarter economists had expected growth</text>
  <text start="385.74" dur="4.549">to slow eat by even more to an</text>
  <text start="387.78" dur="4.56">annualized rate of about 1.6</text>
  <text start="390.289" dur="6.071">inflation-adjusted consumer spending</text>
  <text start="392.34" dur="7.11">rose to 2.9 above the forecast for 2.6</text>
  <text start="396.36" dur="6.33">percent so the economy is still moving</text>
  <text start="399.45" dur="5.189">along it&amp;#39;s not doing as well as Trump</text>
  <text start="402.69" dur="5.22">would like it to do he rather have a</text>
  <text start="404.639" dur="5.881">higher GDP number but this plays into</text>
  <text start="407.91" dur="4.47">what just happened here first The</text>
  <text start="410.52" dur="3.66">Economist thought the number was going</text>
  <text start="412.38" dur="4.409">to be much much lower and it turned out</text>
  <text start="414.18" dur="7.23">the number was higher secondly this</text>
  <text start="416.789" dur="8.161">allowed the Fed to say hey let&amp;#39;s cut the</text>
  <text start="421.41" dur="7.15">interest rates again and that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="424.95" dur="5.439">what they did the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="428.56" dur="4.079">cut its interest rate target by a</text>
  <text start="430.389" dur="4.291">quarter percentage point for the third</text>
  <text start="432.639" dur="3.811">time this year eight of the ten Fed</text>
  <text start="434.68" dur="3.81">officials voted in favor of lowering the</text>
  <text start="436.45" dur="5.939">federal funds target rate to arrange</text>
  <text start="438.49" dur="6.05">between 1.5 zero percent and 1.75</text>
  <text start="442.389" dur="5.881">percent with two Reserve Bank presidents</text>
  <text start="444.54" dur="7.33">preferring to hold rates steady so once</text>
  <text start="448.27" dur="6.18">again Trump with him continually</text>
  <text start="451.87" dur="5.1">tweeting out telling the mainstream</text>
  <text start="454.45" dur="4.56">media reporters that he wants the Fed to</text>
  <text start="456.97" dur="4.44">cut rates we need to come we need to be</text>
  <text start="459.01" dur="5.25">competitive across the world other</text>
  <text start="461.41" dur="5.64">countries other areas other central</text>
  <text start="464.26" dur="4.5">banks are in the negative territory how</text>
  <text start="467.05" dur="5.48">are we going to compete if we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="468.76" dur="10.26">even close to that and Trump has just</text>
  <text start="472.53" dur="10.18">won he now has the Fed doing exactly</text>
  <text start="479.02" dur="7.47">what he wants and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="482.71" dur="9.24">market what do we see the market has</text>
  <text start="486.49" dur="9.57">taken off gold has gone up like I said</text>
  <text start="491.95" dur="7.29">before Trump is bringing the Fed to</text>
  <text start="496.06" dur="6.96">where he wants there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="499.24" dur="6.72">certain point when we hit that magical</text>
  <text start="503.02" dur="5.16">rate and we hit magical stimulus where</text>
  <text start="505.96" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;re going to see the economy take off</text>
  <text start="508.18" dur="5.13">all these financial pun ins and everyone</text>
  <text start="511.06" dur="5.49">out there saying that if we lower rates</text>
  <text start="513.31" dur="6.51">and we start stimulus the economy is not</text>
  <text start="516.55" dur="5.4">going to do well have it backwards and</text>
  <text start="519.82" dur="4.89">the reason there&amp;#39;s a reason why they are</text>
  <text start="521.95" dur="4.41">telling people that if Trump does this</text>
  <text start="524.71" dur="4.47">the economy is going to fail we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="526.36" dur="5.97">enter a recession because they know that</text>
  <text start="529.18" dur="6.81">if he continues with this economic</text>
  <text start="532.33" dur="6.87">policy and forces the Fed to cut rates</text>
  <text start="535.99" dur="5.91">and the Fed follows the economy is going</text>
  <text start="539.2" dur="5.1">to take off we&amp;#39;re not going to receipt</text>
  <text start="541.9" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re not gonna see a recession in 2020</text>
  <text start="544.3" dur="4.11">and we already see this happening now</text>
  <text start="546.88" dur="3.24">does that mean the markets not going to</text>
  <text start="548.41" dur="2.25">come down a little bit tomorrow or the</text>
  <text start="550.12" dur="2.28">next day</text>
  <text start="550.66" dur="4.32">of course it Bob&amp;#39;s up and down every</text>
  <text start="552.4" dur="6.48">single day the point of all of this is</text>
  <text start="554.98" dur="6.76">that when Trump reaches that magical</text>
  <text start="558.88" dur="5.17">number this is when the economy</text>
  <text start="561.74" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;ll take off and he will hit that</text>
  <text start="564.05" dur="5.4">number will it be this year most likely</text>
  <text start="565.94" dur="6.03">not I do believe the rate cuts are going</text>
  <text start="569.45" dur="4.89">to continue in 2020 because this is</text>
  <text start="571.97" dur="4.47">exactly when he wants this to happen I</text>
  <text start="574.34" dur="5.45">believe he got the Fed to do what he</text>
  <text start="576.44" dur="5.76">wanted to do this year there might be</text>
  <text start="579.79" dur="5.14">another rate cut but I really think</text>
  <text start="582.2" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re gonna wait until next year and I</text>
  <text start="584.93" dur="5.07">think this is when we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="587.09" dur="5.64">the fireworks and Trump needed to do</text>
  <text start="590" dur="5.19">this this is not the central bank</text>
  <text start="592.73" dur="5.39">protecting themselves the central bank</text>
  <text start="595.19" dur="6.29">was on course to bring the system down</text>
  <text start="598.12" dur="6.09">the central bank realized that Trump</text>
  <text start="601.48" dur="6.37">controlled the economic narrative and</text>
  <text start="604.21" dur="6.94">there was no way out for them they lost</text>
  <text start="607.85" dur="7.56">their opportunity to smash the economy</text>
  <text start="611.15" dur="7.95">and remove Trump from office now they</text>
  <text start="615.41" dur="7.41">just have to go along with him and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="619.1" dur="5.6">going to be their disaster because when</text>
  <text start="622.82" dur="5.46">everything is all said and done and</text>
  <text start="624.7" dur="5.92">Trump turns this all around and says</text>
  <text start="628.28" dur="5.07">listen the economy is doing great and</text>
  <text start="630.62" dur="7.11">now the Fed is doing something</text>
  <text start="633.35" dur="7.86">completely different why why does the</text>
  <text start="637.73" dur="5.52">Fed wanna ruin the economy and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="641.21" dur="5.88">going to see this happen this has all</text>
  <text start="643.25" dur="6.5">been planned because eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="647.09" dur="5.31">going to happen after the 2020 elections</text>
  <text start="649.75" dur="4.78">this is when Trump and the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="652.4" dur="5.22">going to make their move against the</text>
  <text start="654.53" dur="4.71">central bank establishment making a move</text>
  <text start="657.62" dur="5.82">against the central bank establishment</text>
  <text start="659.24" dur="7.08">is going to be a battle they do not want</text>
  <text start="663.44" dur="7.02">to give up control they will go to war</text>
  <text start="666.32" dur="6.59">to keep control they&amp;#39;ve done it in the</text>
  <text start="670.46" dur="6.93">past they&amp;#39;ll do it in the future and</text>
  <text start="672.91" dur="8.2">they will not budge unless they are</text>
  <text start="677.39" dur="7.53">forced out and the Patriots are ready to</text>
  <text start="681.11" dur="6.09">force them out and they will force them</text>
  <text start="684.92" dur="4.169">out because</text>
  <text start="687.2" dur="4.8">everything that Trump of the Patriots</text>
  <text start="689.089" dur="5.25">are doing would be absolutely worthless</text>
  <text start="692" dur="7.76">if we do not remove the central bank</text>
  <text start="694.339" dur="8.971">system even if we reset and the debt is</text>
  <text start="699.76" dur="6.879">forgiven and we don&amp;#39;t go back to a sound</text>
  <text start="703.31" dur="5.459">money system or if we do go back to a</text>
  <text start="706.639" dur="5.01">Salamone system and the private western</text>
  <text start="708.769" dur="7.951">central bank is still in power we&amp;#39;ll end</text>
  <text start="711.649" dur="8.581">up exactly where we are today the world</text>
  <text start="716.72" dur="7.109">will end up exactly where we are today</text>
  <text start="720.23" dur="6.33">actually it might even be worse the only</text>
  <text start="723.829" dur="5.491">way moving forward is to remove the</text>
  <text start="726.56" dur="4.01">source of the problem remove the source</text>
  <text start="729.32" dur="4.079">of corruption</text>
  <text start="730.57" dur="5.59">remember the central bank is like a</text>
