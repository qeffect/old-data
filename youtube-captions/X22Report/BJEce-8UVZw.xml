  <text start="38.78" dur="5.04">first 2016 and the top of the episode is</text>
  <text start="41.51" dur="5.61">there are critical areas that are now</text>
  <text start="43.82" dur="6.36">set up to push the call for war let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="47.12" dur="5.52">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="50.18" dur="7.29">and geopolitical news now we know that</text>
  <text start="52.64" dur="6.03">the US government has been spying on the</text>
  <text start="57.47" dur="3.93">everyday person they&amp;#39;ve been using</text>
  <text start="58.67" dur="7.82">devices like stingray they&amp;#39;ve been using</text>
  <text start="61.4" dur="7.38">the NSA CIA FBI fusion centers and</text>
  <text start="66.49" dur="6.19">Maryland the second highest court upheld</text>
  <text start="68.78" dur="7.56">a previous ruling that now requires law</text>
  <text start="72.68" dur="6.12">enforcement to establish probable cause</text>
  <text start="76.34" dur="6.12">and obtain a warrant before using the</text>
  <text start="78.8" dur="8.58">Stingray devices now why do we need a</text>
  <text start="82.46" dur="7.53">court to say they need a warrant think</text>
  <text start="87.38" dur="5.19">about it all these agencies they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="89.99" dur="4.35">sworn in to uphold the Constitution of</text>
  <text start="92.57" dur="4.02">the United States and to protect the</text>
  <text start="94.34" dur="5.43">rights of the people and when we look at</text>
  <text start="96.59" dur="5.67">the the rights of the Constitution we</text>
  <text start="99.77" dur="6.66">have the Fourth Amendment do we really</text>
  <text start="102.26" dur="8.22">need the Supreme Court or the high court</text>
  <text start="106.43" dur="8.16">or any court to continually tell these</text>
  <text start="110.48" dur="6.02">agencies that they have to abide by the</text>
  <text start="114.59" dur="5.88">Bill of Rights and the Constitution I</text>
  <text start="116.5" dur="7.78">don&amp;#39;t think so I think if they can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="120.47" dur="6.08">this and they can&amp;#39;t follow these simple</text>
  <text start="124.28" dur="4.86">rules they&amp;#39;re not really that difficult</text>
  <text start="126.55" dur="7.15">then they shouldn&amp;#39;t be in the positions</text>
  <text start="129.14" dur="6.81">they&amp;#39;re in and we see that the court&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="133.7" dur="4.38">opinion is a resounding defense of the</text>
  <text start="135.95" dur="4.74">Fourth Amendment right in the digital</text>
  <text start="138.08" dur="4.739">age this is coming from Nathan freed</text>

  <text start="142.819" dur="5.791">American Civil Liberties Union and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="146.209" dur="4.351">saying that all of these secret</text>
  <text start="148.61" dur="4.379">warrantless use of evasive cell phone</text>
  <text start="150.56" dur="4.77">tracking technology shows why it is so</text>
  <text start="152.989" dur="4.771">important for these kinds of privacy</text>
  <text start="155.33" dur="7.23">invasions to be subjected to judicial</text>
  <text start="157.76" dur="6.71">review I&amp;#39;m saying why do we even have to</text>
  <text start="162.56" dur="4.88">do this</text>
  <text start="164.47" dur="5.85">if the police and all these agencies</text>
  <text start="167.44" dur="6">can&amp;#39;t abide by the simple rules that the</text>
  <text start="170.32" dur="5.67">people have said to them listen here is</text>
  <text start="173.44" dur="4.17">the contract you will buy buy the right</text>
  <text start="175.99" dur="3.75">to the people you abide by the</text>
  <text start="177.61" dur="5.13">Constitution that&amp;#39;s what you have to</text>
  <text start="179.74" dur="6.21">follow here if they can&amp;#39;t do that they</text>
  <text start="182.74" dur="5.46">shouldn&amp;#39;t be in position at all you know</text>
  <text start="185.95" dur="5.22">out in the UK we see that there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="188.2" dur="7.05">to be a thousand or more armed police on</text>
  <text start="191.17" dur="6.3">the streets to counter terrorism like</text>
  <text start="195.25" dur="7.05">Paris deep just like the peristyle</text>
  <text start="197.47" dur="6.54">attacks now is this the real reason</text>
  <text start="202.3" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re putting a thousand more armed</text>
  <text start="204.01" dur="5.22">police on the streets because as we can</text>
  <text start="206.35" dur="6.12">see throughout Europe even here in the</text>
  <text start="209.23" dur="7.2">United States having the police around</text>
  <text start="212.47" dur="7.41">really doesn&amp;#39;t stop anything they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="216.43" dur="7.14">always there for the aftermath it hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="219.88" dur="7.11">saved anyone&amp;#39;s lives because we know</text>
  <text start="223.57" dur="7.139">most of these are inside jobs conducted</text>
  <text start="226.99" dur="5.91">by certain agencies what they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="230.709" dur="4.261">doing is they&amp;#39;re continually putting</text>
  <text start="232.9" dur="4.02">more and more boots on the ground to</text>
  <text start="234.97" dur="4.5">control the population when everything</text>
  <text start="236.92" dur="4.849">goes completely out of whack and when I</text>
  <text start="239.47" dur="5.97">say out of whack i mean the complete</text>
  <text start="241.769" dur="6.521">destruction of the economy where people</text>
  <text start="245.44" dur="7.62">are very upset I don&amp;#39;t think everyone</text>
  <text start="248.29" dur="9">realizes and maybe you do how people</text>
  <text start="253.06" dur="7.2">actually get when they realize they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="257.29" dur="6.24">lost their jobs they&amp;#39;ve lost their</text>
  <text start="260.26" dur="6.54">savings and there&amp;#39;s nothing left back in</text>
  <text start="263.53" dur="7.68">the Great Depression people jumped off</text>
  <text start="266.8" dur="6.09">the bridges out of buildings they killed</text>
  <text start="271.21" dur="4.86">themselves in the last great recession</text>
  <text start="272.89" dur="5.57">in 2008 many people took their own lives</text>
  <text start="276.07" dur="5.46">because they just couldn&amp;#39;t handle it a</text>
  <text start="278.46" dur="7.36">lot of people were very angry and what</text>
  <text start="281.53" dur="7.949">happened this time it&amp;#39;s going to be even</text>
  <text start="285.82" dur="6.74">worse I mean I&amp;#39;ve seen it back in 2008</text>
  <text start="289.479" dur="7.141">2009 2010 when I know a lot of people</text>
  <text start="292.56" dur="5.21">where they lost their job they hid in</text>
  <text start="296.62" dur="5.32">their houses for weeks</text>
  <text start="297.77" dur="7.92">on end they didn&amp;#39;t show their faces from</text>
  <text start="301.94" dur="4.92">embarrassment they were angry they tried</text>
  <text start="305.69" dur="4.59">to look for another job they just</text>
  <text start="306.86" dur="7.32">couldn&amp;#39;t find one and it is a difficult</text>
  <text start="310.28" dur="8.639">situation to go through and when you</text>
  <text start="314.18" dur="8.88">lose your savings your retirement your</text>
  <text start="318.919" dur="6.75">job people are not going to be happiness</text>
  <text start="323.06" dur="6.09">pecially when they&amp;#39;re trying to feed</text>
  <text start="325.669" dur="5.851">their family and this is why every</text>
  <text start="329.15" dur="3.78">single country right now is putting more</text>
  <text start="331.52" dur="3.48">and more boots on the ground because</text>
  <text start="332.93" dur="4.56">they realize is going to be riots people</text>
  <text start="335" dur="4.889">are going to blame them people are going</text>
  <text start="337.49" dur="4.079">to come after them and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="339.889" dur="8.131">really doing is they&amp;#39;re protecting</text>
  <text start="341.569" dur="9.451">themselves from those who might threaten</text>
  <text start="348.02" dur="6.42">their authority it&amp;#39;s almost as if we go</text>
  <text start="351.02" dur="5.369">back to the royal families the Kings the</text>
  <text start="354.44" dur="5.49">Queen&amp;#39;s and the serfs when the people</text>
  <text start="356.389" dur="7.261">say okay we&amp;#39;re suffering out here we</text>
  <text start="359.93" dur="8.88">have no food we have no funds you taxed</text>
  <text start="363.65" dur="7.65">us it to oblivion and we have nothing</text>
  <text start="368.81" dur="3.9">left and usually what happens is the</text>
  <text start="371.3" dur="4.94">people rise up and say we have had</text>
  <text start="372.71" dur="7.31">enough and they go after those people</text>
  <text start="376.24" dur="6.64">who were in charge of everything and</text>
  <text start="380.02" dur="5.32">most of the time it doesn&amp;#39;t end well for</text>
  <text start="382.88" dur="6.06">those in power and the people in power</text>
  <text start="385.34" dur="6.629">today they realize this now out in</text>
  <text start="388.94" dur="6.509">Brazil we understand there is some type</text>
  <text start="391.969" dur="7.141">of coup going on and we see that Ross</text>
  <text start="395.449" dur="6">offs party and protesters took to the</text>
  <text start="399.11" dur="4.529">street an estimated eight hundred</text>
  <text start="401.449" dur="5.78">thousand protesters took to the street</text>
  <text start="403.639" dur="7.77">in ninety four cities to support</text>
  <text start="407.229" dur="7.331">Rousseff&amp;#39;s and her government chanting</text>
  <text start="411.409" dur="7.051">there will be no coup there will be a</text>
  <text start="414.56" dur="5.49">fight so we can see many things are</text>
  <text start="418.46" dur="6.299">happening here things are starting to</text>
  <text start="420.05" dur="6.929">heat up and we realize the US government</text>
  <text start="424.759" dur="6.721">central bankers they&amp;#39;ve been trying to</text>
  <text start="426.979" dur="5.971">get into Venezuela Brazil Argentina just</text>
  <text start="431.48" dur="3.51">go all the other countries because they</text>
  <text start="432.95" dur="5.22">need control they need a puppet</text>
  <text start="434.99" dur="6.12">government they need the oil they need</text>
  <text start="438.17" dur="5.58">to break up the brick system and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="441.11" dur="6.12">do whatever they possibly have to do</text>
  <text start="443.75" dur="7.14">these things now we see that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="447.23" dur="6.35">along with South Korea along with Japan</text>
  <text start="450.89" dur="5.07">president Prime Minister Shinzo Abe a</text>
  <text start="453.58" dur="5.92">they&amp;#39;re all talking about North Korea</text>
  <text start="455.96" dur="5.55">over their provocations and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="459.5" dur="5.01">vowing to ramp up pressure on North</text>
  <text start="461.51" dur="5.1">Korea in response to that nuclear test</text>
  <text start="464.51" dur="4.2">which of course there is no proof they</text>
  <text start="466.61" dur="4.23">actually had one because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="468.71" dur="6.18">radiation there was an earthquake but</text>
  <text start="470.84" dur="6.18">that could have been just natural but no</text>
  <text start="474.89" dur="7.02">one has actually proved that they</text>
  <text start="477.02" dur="6.84">exploded any type of nuclear weapon but</text>
  <text start="481.91" dur="3.93">of course that doesn&amp;#39;t really matter</text>
  <text start="483.86" dur="4.05">because in the age of propaganda all</text>
  <text start="485.84" dur="3.84">they have to say is they have a nuclear</text>
  <text start="487.91" dur="4.14">weapon look see there was an earthquake</text>
  <text start="489.68" dur="4.05">we have to increase the military budgets</text>
  <text start="492.05" dur="3.63">we have to bring more weapons into the</text>
  <text start="493.73" dur="4.8">area we have to have these vast amounts</text>
  <text start="495.68" dur="4.86">of drills to provoke North Korea we have</text>
  <text start="498.53" dur="4.56">to bring in more military and stationed</text>
  <text start="500.54" dur="4.38">than there and this is exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="503.09" dur="5.25">going on not just with North Korea but</text>
  <text start="504.92" dur="7.47">with China with Russia with Syria with</text>
  <text start="508.34" dur="8.63">Iran because the players are always the</text>
  <text start="512.39" dur="8.48">same now Ukraine wants to replace Russia</text>
  <text start="516.97" dur="7.78">with turkey when it comes to energy and</text>
  <text start="520.87" dur="6.69">they&amp;#39;re saying that turkey is increasing</text>
  <text start="524.75" dur="5.31">its consumption of all energy resources</text>
  <text start="527.56" dur="4.66">Ukraine has the technology that turkey</text>
  <text start="530.06" dur="5.97">needs that is why we are ready to</text>
  <text start="532.22" dur="6.42">cooperate and we can see that Ukraine</text>
  <text start="536.03" dur="5.61">and Turkey or becoming closer and closer</text>
  <text start="538.64" dur="7.11">together here they will control the</text>
  <text start="541.64" dur="7.62">Black Sea area and we know why this is</text>
  <text start="545.75" dur="5.31">all happening because eventually all of</text>
  <text start="549.26" dur="3.57">this is going to lead into war and they</text>
  <text start="551.06" dur="6.12">know that they will be going up against</text>
  <text start="552.83" dur="6.96">Russia now price President Biden he met</text>
  <text start="557.18" dur="4.77">with poroshenko and he&amp;#39;s letting</text>
  <text start="559.79" dur="6.44">poroshenko know that the u.s. is ready</text>
  <text start="561.95" dur="6.96">to give 335 million in security a</text>
  <text start="566.23" dur="5.2">very interesting but what&amp;#39;s even more</text>
  <text start="568.91" dur="3.84">interesting about this is that out in</text>
  <text start="571.43" dur="3.9">Ukraine we&amp;#39;re starting to see things</text>
  <text start="572.75" dur="5.42">really heat up right now Kiev</text>
  <text start="575.33" dur="5.58">authorities are attempting to justify</text>
  <text start="578.17" dur="5.59">their sabotage of the Mint&amp;#39;s peace</text>
  <text start="580.91" dur="4.71">accords by artificially maintaining</text>
  <text start="583.76" dur="5.04">tensions along the contact line in</text>
  <text start="585.62" dur="5.91">eastern Ukraine and the Russian Foreign</text>
  <text start="588.8" dur="4.13">Ministry is reporting on this and saying</text>
  <text start="591.53" dur="4.74">yes there are tensions that are</text>
  <text start="592.93" dur="6.61">continually escalating and Kiev is</text>
  <text start="596.27" dur="4.71">refusing to respect any of the</text>
  <text start="599.54" dur="4.38">commitments they&amp;#39;re not withdrawing</text>
  <text start="600.98" dur="5.79">their weapons and we&amp;#39;re getting word</text>
  <text start="603.92" dur="5.64">that dozens of tanks and artillery</text>
  <text start="606.77" dur="5.22">pieces had have been deployed on the</text>
  <text start="609.56" dur="5.78">outskirts of the city of Donetsk and it</text>
  <text start="611.99" dur="6.12">looks like more and more forces are</text>
  <text start="615.34" dur="4.54">lining up on the count on the contact</text>
  <text start="618.11" dur="6.18">line and it looks like they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="619.88" dur="7.56">be going after this area and it looks</text>
  <text start="624.29" dur="4.62">like at this point they&amp;#39;re never going</text>
  <text start="627.44" dur="4.38">to fulfill the mints to cease fire</text>
  <text start="628.91" dur="8.09">agreement the u.s. is giving them more</text>
  <text start="631.82" dur="7.5">aid the training is complete in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="637" dur="5.59">they&amp;#39;re not withdrawing their weapons</text>
  <text start="639.32" dur="7.86">and now we see military assets being</text>
  <text start="642.59" dur="6.6">moved to the front lines and I would not</text>
  <text start="647.18" dur="5.37">be surprised in the next month two</text>
  <text start="649.19" dur="5.64">months this shelling that&amp;#39;s going back</text>
  <text start="652.55" dur="5.39">and forth I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if</text>
  <text start="654.83" dur="7.98">this escalates into a full-blown</text>
  <text start="657.94" dur="8.53">offensive now NATO just made a dramatic</text>
  <text start="662.81" dur="6.81">shift in the Eastern European doctrine</text>
  <text start="666.47" dur="6.36">they went from assurance to deterrence</text>
  <text start="669.62" dur="5.13">and NATO general Philip Breedlove said</text>
  <text start="672.83" dur="4.7">that NATO and the United States are</text>
  <text start="674.75" dur="5.7">switching their defense doctrine and</text>
  <text start="677.53" dur="5.38">they&amp;#39;re saying that they need to do this</text>
  <text start="680.45" dur="5.58">because of the resurgent of Russian</text>
  <text start="682.91" dur="6.27">aggression he said we are prepared to</text>
  <text start="686.03" dur="5.13">fight and win if we have to to the east</text>
  <text start="689.18" dur="5.25">and north we face a resurgent and</text>
  <text start="691.16" dur="7.07">aggressive Russia and we have continued</text>
  <text start="694.43" dur="6.35">to witness these last two years Russian</text>
  <text start="698.23" dur="5.82">Russia continues to seek to extend in</text>
  <text start="700.78" dur="7.35">its influence on the periphery and</text>
  <text start="704.05" dur="8.52">beyond really because when you look at</text>
  <text start="708.13" dur="6.18">the map all you see and if you come to</text>
  <text start="712.57" dur="3.33">the x20 report com site you can see the</text>
  <text start="714.31" dur="4.68">map or if you&amp;#39;re on YouTube you can see</text>
  <text start="715.9" dur="6.83">the map where NATO and United States</text>
  <text start="718.99" dur="7.85">they are completely surrounding Russia</text>
  <text start="722.73" dur="7.89">they are completely encircling China and</text>
  <text start="726.84" dur="6.67">the influence of China and Russia are</text>
  <text start="730.62" dur="5.5">nowhere to be found actually the</text>
  <text start="733.51" dur="7.11">influence of the United States can be</text>
  <text start="736.12" dur="6.45">found everywhere so we see the opposite</text>
  <text start="740.62" dur="5.13">having here but they need to convince</text>
  <text start="742.57" dur="4.83">the world and everyone that Russia is</text>
  <text start="745.75" dur="3.63">very aggressive this is why we need to</text>
  <text start="747.4" dur="4.2">go to war but if you really look at the</text>
  <text start="749.38" dur="4.29">actions of Russia and you really look at</text>
  <text start="751.6" dur="6.39">what they&amp;#39;ve been doing you see that</text>
