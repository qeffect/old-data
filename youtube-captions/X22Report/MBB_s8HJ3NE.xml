  <text start="32.879" dur="5.791">today&amp;#39;s date is July 31st 2014 and the</text>
  <text start="36.36" dur="3.99">title this episode is the economy is in</text>
  <text start="38.67" dur="4.709">trouble and the central bankers have</text>
  <text start="40.35" dur="5.91">prepared a special event to cover it up</text>
  <text start="43.379" dur="4.951">and we can see right now they came out</text>
  <text start="46.26" dur="5.399">yesterday with this absolutely</text>
  <text start="48.33" dur="5.79">ridiculous GDP number at four percent of</text>
  <text start="51.659" dur="6.061">course that means we had a 6.1 percent</text>
  <text start="54.12" dur="6.32">gain and this just does not make sense</text>
  <text start="57.72" dur="6.149">now we can see today the markets have</text>
  <text start="60.44" dur="5.289">pretty much collapsed on itself now you</text>
  <text start="63.869" dur="4.081">would think with all this great news in</text>
  <text start="65.729" dur="4.921">the economy improving we would see</text>
  <text start="67.95" dur="4.709">better results in the market but what</text>
  <text start="70.65" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;re seeing is the actual opposite at</text>
  <text start="72.659" dur="5.88">this time we can see when we look across</text>
  <text start="75.03" dur="5.729">the world the flash points for war is</text>
  <text start="78.539" dur="4.29">getting worse things are starting to</text>
  <text start="80.759" dur="5.25">really build up we see in the Middle</text>
  <text start="82.829" dur="5.161">East Libya now is pretty much taking</text>
  <text start="86.009" dur="4.86">over the country a lot of countries are</text>
  <text start="87.99" dur="5.1">evacuating their government officials</text>
  <text start="90.869" dur="4.92">because they realize the government is</text>
  <text start="93.09" dur="5.43">falling we see this spreading to Yemen</text>
  <text start="95.789" dur="5.731">we see in the Ukraine the government up</text>
  <text start="98.52" dur="5.25">there is collapsing they are pretty much</text>
  <text start="101.52" dur="5.01">the whole economy actually is just</text>
  <text start="103.77" dur="4.32">falling apart and we can see the IMF is</text>
  <text start="106.53" dur="3.269">holding back and giving them any more</text>
  <text start="108.09" dur="3.059">money we have to see if the United</text>
  <text start="109.799" dur="4.14">States is going to come through and give</text>
  <text start="111.149" dur="5.97">them a couple mil just to hold them over</text>
  <text start="113.939" dur="5.61">and we can see right now they will do</text>
  <text start="117.119" dur="5.1">anything and everything to continually</text>
  <text start="119.549" dur="4.89">push their agenda in Ukraine they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="122.219" dur="4.951">continually placing sanctions on Russia</text>
  <text start="124.439" dur="4.831">they&amp;#39;re continually blaming Russia we</text>
  <text start="127.17" dur="4.71">see in the Middle East they are using</text>
  <text start="129.27" dur="5.7">the Islamic state to completely create</text>
  <text start="131.88" dur="4.68">chaos within the area and this is all</text>
  <text start="134.97" dur="5.42">part of their plan and we know their</text>
  <text start="136.56" dur="7.07">goal is always the same their goal is to</text>
  <text start="140.39" dur="5.85">get into Syria and Iran that has not</text>
  <text start="143.63" dur="3.78">changed their tactics might have changed</text>
  <text start="146.24" dur="3.54">they might have stepped back and said</text>
  <text start="147.41" dur="4.29">okay let&amp;#39;s reassess the issue we need</text>
  <text start="149.78" dur="3.539">another way we&amp;#39;ve been trying to get</text>
  <text start="151.7" dur="3.45">into Syria for quite a long time with</text>
  <text start="153.319" dur="3.811">this civil war it&amp;#39;s not working</text>
  <text start="155.15" dur="3.96">let&amp;#39;s see what else we can do they tried</text>
  <text start="157.13" dur="5.37">the chemical attacks that didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="159.11" dur="5.88">now they&amp;#39;re into the next phase they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="162.5" dur="6.84">using the Islamic state and they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="164.99" dur="6.03">using other tactics to bring us to war</text>
  <text start="169.34" dur="4.17">and we can see they are trying</text>
  <text start="171.02" dur="5.4">everything they possibly can why because</text>
  <text start="173.51" dur="6.06">the economy is falling apart it is</text>
  <text start="176.42" dur="5.22">collapsing it cannot be maintained and</text>
  <text start="179.57" dur="6.48">there&amp;#39;s a lot of warnings out there now</text>
  <text start="181.64" dur="6.66">a lot of CEOs and investment financial</text>
  <text start="186.05" dur="5.159">hedge fund managers coming out saying</text>
  <text start="188.3" dur="5.64">yes it looks like we are headed towards</text>
  <text start="191.209" dur="4.801">a stock market crash and we can see from</text>
  <text start="193.94" dur="5.97">everything that happened in the previous</text>
  <text start="196.01" dur="6.8">times back in 2008 and further back we</text>
  <text start="199.91" dur="5.85">know every time they try to push a</text>
  <text start="202.81" dur="4.81">recovery or everything that&amp;#39;s fine and</text>
  <text start="205.76" dur="3.63">they continually throw that in our face</text>
  <text start="207.62" dur="3.27">we know the opposite is actually</text>
  <text start="209.39" dur="2.76">happening now let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="210.89" dur="4.099">economic collapse dudes now what are we</text>
  <text start="212.15" dur="6.96">seeing here well we are seeing now that</text>
  <text start="214.989" dur="6.191">Argentina is in selective default by</text>
  <text start="219.11" dur="3.599">Standard and Poor&amp;#39;s and we have to</text>
  <text start="221.18" dur="4.41">understand if we think if we look back</text>
  <text start="222.709" dur="5.011">we know that Argentina and the</text>
  <text start="225.59" dur="4.38">bondholders both of them were supposed</text>
  <text start="227.72" dur="5.01">to attend a meeting and nobody showed up</text>
  <text start="229.97" dur="4.53">and we also have to understand Argentina</text>
  <text start="232.73" dur="3.84">has been dealing with the BRIC nations</text>
  <text start="234.5" dur="4.38">it looks like they want to join the</text>
  <text start="236.57" dur="4.11">BRICS they&amp;#39;re also dealing with China</text>
  <text start="238.88" dur="4.32">China is pumping billions into their</text>
  <text start="240.68" dur="4.589">infrastructure also giving them loans so</text>
  <text start="243.2" dur="4.289">they might be looking away at this point</text>
  <text start="245.269" dur="4.741">and looking towards the BRICS and China</text>
  <text start="247.489" dur="4.5">and stepping away from the private</text>
  <text start="250.01" dur="4.19">western central bankers and all those</text>
  <text start="251.989" dur="5.071">other people that they owe now in</text>
  <text start="254.2" dur="5.8">Bulgaria what we&amp;#39;re seeing is Moody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="257.06" dur="4.95">has cut Bulgarian corporate deposit</text>
  <text start="260" dur="4.5">rating now why did they do this we</text>
  <text start="262.01" dur="5.64">understand that Bulgaria had a trouble</text>
  <text start="264.5" dur="5.7">bank and as soon as this happened people</text>
  <text start="267.65" dur="4.65">started to make a run on the banking</text>
  <text start="270.2" dur="3.929">system and right now they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="272.3" dur="4.289">releasing any of the</text>
  <text start="274.129" dur="3.96">considers funds and this is the reason</text>
  <text start="276.589" dur="3.36">why moody stepped in and said listen</text>
  <text start="278.089" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;re going to downgrade you because</text>
  <text start="279.949" dur="5.4">what prompted this was the increased</text>
  <text start="282.649" dur="4.651">risk of losses to depositors given the</text>
  <text start="285.349" dur="4.71">uncertainty with regards to when they</text>
  <text start="287.3" dur="4.799">will regain access to their deposits so</text>
  <text start="290.059" dur="4.26">we can see right now these people can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="292.099" dur="3.69">even get their money of course one day</text>
  <text start="294.319" dur="2.97">they woke up and all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="295.789" dur="3.39">banks were shut down they couldn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="297.289" dur="3.27">their money and people ran to the bank</text>
  <text start="299.179" dur="3.75">to try to get them out the same thing</text>
  <text start="300.559" dur="4.83">happened in Cyprus and we can see the</text>
  <text start="302.929" dur="6.23">same thing happened here in the United</text>
  <text start="305.389" dur="7.05">States now we can see the employment</text>
  <text start="309.159" dur="5.68">claims the initial claims completely</text>
  <text start="312.439" dur="5.31">missed expectations and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="314.839" dur="5.13">seeing right now is if we remember we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="317.749" dur="4.56">had a lot of layoffs in the beginning of</text>
  <text start="319.969" dur="4.98">this year and many times when these are</text>
  <text start="322.309" dur="4.44">high paying jobs which they were in a</text>
  <text start="324.949" dur="4.98">lot of the companies that were in Dell</text>
  <text start="326.749" dur="4.83">Sony Barclays RBS a lot of people get</text>
  <text start="329.929" dur="3.69">severance packages and they last</text>
  <text start="331.579" dur="4.02">anywhere from depending on how long you</text>
  <text start="333.619" dur="4.23">work from the cut for the company from</text>
  <text start="335.599" dur="5.88">three months six months or even up to</text>
  <text start="337.849" dur="6.511">one year but we&amp;#39;re seeing this number</text>
  <text start="341.479" dur="7.29">start to tick up and they were expecting</text>
  <text start="344.36" dur="7.5">about a 280,000 print and it increased</text>
  <text start="348.769" dur="5.55">to about three hundred and two so it</text>
  <text start="351.86" dur="6.659">really skyrocketed this time and it</text>
  <text start="354.319" dur="9.08">really increased and what else are we</text>
  <text start="358.519" dur="8.25">seeing here well we&amp;#39;re seeing layoffs</text>
  <text start="363.399" dur="6.52">increasing US employers plan to cut</text>
  <text start="366.769" dur="4.5">nearly 50,000 positions in July this is</text>
  <text start="369.919" dur="3.42">coming from Challenger gray and</text>
  <text start="371.269" dur="4.32">Christmas which reported this on</text>
  <text start="373.339" dur="5.13">Thursday this is pretty much netting</text>
  <text start="375.589" dur="6.51">about 50% more job cuts than in the</text>
  <text start="378.469" dur="4.98">prior month to date right now since the</text>
  <text start="382.099" dur="5.1">beginning of this year we&amp;#39;ve had about</text>
  <text start="383.449" dur="6.99">two hundred and ninety two thousand job</text>
  <text start="387.199" dur="6.36">cuts and more on the way and like I said</text>
  <text start="390.439" dur="5.79">as we move into the late summer and into</text>
  <text start="393.559" dur="4.32">fall this number is really going to pick</text>
  <text start="396.229" dur="3.9">up speed we&amp;#39;re going to see many many</text>
  <text start="397.879" dur="4.35">companies start to lay off people now if</text>
  <text start="400.129" dur="3.84">the stock market does crash in October</text>
  <text start="402.229" dur="3.12">of course the Fed told us that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="403.969" dur="3.661">going to be exiting the stimulus program</text>
  <text start="405.349" dur="6.061">we understand back in 1929</text>
  <text start="407.63" dur="7.02">1987 2008 the stock market has crashed</text>
  <text start="411.41" dur="5.37">in October this will send a signal to</text>
  <text start="414.65" dur="4.38">pretty much every single company that</text>
  <text start="416.78" dur="4.86">the economy is dead and they will be</text>
  <text start="419.03" dur="5.55">laying off people in in masses I mean it</text>
  <text start="421.64" dur="5.58">will just be crazy and people will be</text>
  <text start="424.58" dur="6.75">wondering what is going on but I really</text>
  <text start="427.22" dur="5.97">truly do believe that the Fed the United</text>
  <text start="431.33" dur="3.69">States government will not let this</text>
  <text start="433.19" dur="4.41">happen this time I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="435.02" dur="4.23">planning on an event that will occur</text>
  <text start="437.6" dur="4.56">pretty much at the same time because</text>
  <text start="439.25" dur="4.83">they will need to blame this on another</text>
  <text start="442.16" dur="4.26">country there is no more bailouts</text>
  <text start="444.08" dur="4.65">there&amp;#39;s no way to go to Congress and ask</text>
  <text start="446.42" dur="4.62">for more money yes they can lock down</text>
  <text start="448.73" dur="5.37">the banks and do balance but you have to</text>
  <text start="451.04" dur="4.62">remember they would be - people would</text>
  <text start="454.1" dur="3.3">blame them they would blame the</text>
  <text start="455.66" dur="3.51">government and they would blame the</text>
  <text start="457.4" dur="4.05">Federal Reserve because they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="459.17" dur="4.62">who caused this so they want this to</text>
  <text start="461.45" dur="5.88">look like it&amp;#39;s coming from another area</text>
  <text start="463.79" dur="6.17">and this will allow them to say hey we</text>
  <text start="467.33" dur="4.92">were recovered we were pretty much</text>
  <text start="469.96" dur="4.78">making the economy better it was</text>
  <text start="472.25" dur="5.4">recovering it looked great and then all</text>

  <text start="849.43" dur="6.84">now the CDC issued a level-3 travel</text>
  <text start="853.69" dur="5.7">alert as the largest Ebola outbreak in</text>
  <text start="856.27" dur="5.73">history starts to spread and we can see</text>
  <text start="859.39" dur="6.21">right now they have travel warnings in</text>
  <text start="862" dur="6">Liberia in Guinea and Sierra Leone and</text>
  <text start="865.6" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re saying that no one should be</text>

  <text start="870.91" dur="5.19">now there&amp;#39;s about 1320 cases have</text>
  <text start="873.67" dur="3.69">occurred in three countries and more</text>
  <text start="876.1" dur="3.35">than seven hundred and twenty-five</text>
  <text start="877.36" dur="5.729">people have died making this the largest</text>
  <text start="879.45" dur="5.889">outbreak of Ebola in history and right</text>
  <text start="883.089" dur="4.5">now three Americans have been infected</text>
  <text start="885.339" dur="5.641">so we have to watch this very carefully</text>
  <text start="887.589" dur="7.021">this is a very scary thing when a</text>
  <text start="890.98" dur="6.479">disease or a virus or anything is moving</text>
  <text start="894.61" dur="6.599">across and just killing people and it is</text>
  <text start="897.459" dur="5.521">very scary and what happens if Ebola</text>
  <text start="901.209" dur="3.541">comes to America and starts spreading</text>
  <text start="902.98" dur="4.08">one of the first things that would</text>
  <text start="904.75" dur="5.339">happen would be for the CDC to issue a</text>
  <text start="907.06" dur="5.07">federal isolation or quarantine order</text>
  <text start="910.089" dur="4.381">the following is what the CDC website</text>
  <text start="912.13" dur="6.57">says about what would happen under such</text>
  <text start="914.47" dur="6.359">an order quarantine is issues used to</text>
  <text start="918.7" dur="5.07">separate and restrict the movement of</text>
  <text start="920.829" dur="6.031">well persons who may have been exposed</text>
  <text start="923.77" dur="5.879">to a communicable disease to see if they</text>
  <text start="926.86" dur="5.13">become ill isolation and quarantine are</text>
  <text start="929.649" dur="4.5">used to protect the public from by</text>
  <text start="931.99" dur="4.8">preventing exposure to infected persons</text>
  <text start="934.149" dur="5.461">or to persons who may be infected</text>
  <text start="936.79" dur="5.52">so there is right now there is no</text>
  <text start="939.61" dur="5.61">vaccine for Ebola and there</text>
  <text start="942.31" dur="5.01">no cure the Department of Defense</text>
  <text start="945.22" dur="4.2">informed Congress that it has deployed</text>
  <text start="947.32" dur="5.13">biological diagnostic systems to</text>
  <text start="949.42" dur="3.57">National Guard support teams in all 50</text>
  <text start="952.45" dur="2.94">states</text>
  <text start="952.99" dur="4.98">now they deployed these kits and all</text>
  <text start="955.39" dur="5.31">these biological diagnostics to detect</text>
  <text start="957.97" dur="4.05">Ebola but what&amp;#39;s funny about this is the</text>
  <text start="960.7" dur="4.23">White House is out there and they say</text>
  <text start="962.02" dur="5.42">there&amp;#39;s no indication of Ebola risk to</text>
  <text start="964.93" dur="5.04">us whatsoever so don&amp;#39;t worry everyone</text>
  <text start="967.44" dur="4.66">everything is fine but we&amp;#39;re given the</text>
  <text start="969.97" dur="3.3">National Guard all these kits and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="972.1" dur="4.29">spreading it across the United States</text>
  <text start="973.27" dur="4.53">just to make sure so just be careful</text>
  <text start="976.39" dur="3.99">what you&amp;#39;re doing that&amp;#39;s spread through</text>
  <text start="977.8" dur="4.44">like blood and fluid and things like</text>
  <text start="980.38" dur="5.88">that so everyone needs to be a little</text>
  <text start="982.24" dur="7.97">bit cautious now with Obama care</text>
  <text start="986.26" dur="6.75">it looks like premiums are rising in</text>
  <text start="990.21" dur="4.629">California and I mention this in all</text>
  <text start="993.01" dur="3.21">different states here health care</text>
  <text start="994.839" dur="3.721">insurance premiums for individuals in</text>
  <text start="996.22" dur="6">California rose between 22 and 88</text>
  <text start="998.56" dur="5.52">percent in 2014 and they might go even</text>
  <text start="1002.22" dur="4.32">higher so this Affordable Care Act is</text>
  <text start="1004.08" dur="4.44">really not affordable whatsoever people</text>
  <text start="1006.54" dur="3.84">are looking at this and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1008.52" dur="3.39">you know what I am paying a lot of money</text>
  <text start="1010.38" dur="3.03">I&amp;#39;m getting absolutely no benefit</text>
  <text start="1011.91" dur="4.56">because you have to remember most of the</text>
  <text start="1013.41" dur="5.28">plans have very high deductibles you pay</text>
  <text start="1016.47" dur="3.6">a monthly premium and when you go to the</text>
  <text start="1018.69" dur="4.41">doctor you have to pay out of your</text>
  <text start="1020.07" dur="4.83">pocket until you meet you meet that</text>
  <text start="1023.1" dur="3.9">deductible and sometimes that deductible</text>
  <text start="1024.9" dur="4.14">is two thousand sometimes it&amp;#39;s five</text>
  <text start="1027" dur="4.23">thousand it all depends on the plan but</text>
  <text start="1029.04" dur="5.81">you get no benefit you just continually</text>
  <text start="1031.23" dur="6.089">pay out and you pay each month and</text>
  <text start="1034.85" dur="3.88">you&amp;#39;re really receiving absolutely</text>
  <text start="1037.319" dur="3.991">nothing for it now if you decide not to</text>
  <text start="1038.73" dur="5.79">take Obamacare you have to pay a penalty</text>
  <text start="1041.31" dur="6.75">all this was done it was created to</text>
  <text start="1044.52" dur="6.09">create tax revenue for the government it</text>
  <text start="1048.06" dur="7.77">was not to give every single person a</text>
  <text start="1050.61" dur="7.65">benefit using health care if they truly</text>
  <text start="1055.83" dur="5.52">wanted to do this and they wanted to</text>
  <text start="1058.26" dur="5.94">give everyone great health care there be</text>
  <text start="1061.35" dur="4.14">no penalties there be no taxes you</text>
  <text start="1064.2" dur="4.56">wouldn&amp;#39;t have worked with the health</text>
  <text start="1065.49" dur="5.7">insurance companies the way they did it</text>
  <text start="1068.76" dur="5.31">would be only to benefit people but</text>
  <text start="1071.19" dur="4.89">instead what they did was listen how how</text>
  <text start="1074.07" dur="4.859">can we make health insurance</text>
  <text start="1076.08" dur="4.77">a blanket thing across the country and</text>
  <text start="1078.929" dur="4.171">what they did was they said listen if</text>
  <text start="1080.85" dur="4.53">the young people can get into the system</text>
  <text start="1083.1" dur="3.99">they could support the older people and</text>
  <text start="1085.38" dur="4.56">what we&amp;#39;ll have to do is we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="1087.09" dur="5.37">raise the rates for everyone and if we</text>
  <text start="1089.94" dur="3.45">can get everyone in the whole thing will</text>
  <text start="1092.46" dur="3.78">be supported</text>
  <text start="1093.39" dur="4.769">you&amp;#39;ll get no benefits but you&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="1096.24" dur="3.96">supported now how can we get everyone in</text>
  <text start="1098.159" dur="3.99">there I know let&amp;#39;s put a penalty on</text>
  <text start="1100.2" dur="3.719">there and this will help us bring in</text>
  <text start="1102.149" dur="3.961">revenue what else can we do let&amp;#39;s put</text>
  <text start="1103.919" dur="4.921">some taxes in here is this way we can</text>
  <text start="1106.11" dur="4.62">bring in even more revenue and the</text>
  <text start="1108.84" dur="3.299">insurance companies work with the</text>
  <text start="1110.73" dur="4.5">government and they came up with these</text>
  <text start="1112.139" dur="5.611">terrible awful packages which they call</text>
  <text start="1115.23" dur="4.319">the health benefits now of course the</text>
  <text start="1117.75" dur="3.99">government officials said well we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1119.549" dur="4.23">want that we&amp;#39;re exempting ourselves we</text>
  <text start="1121.74" dur="4.95">don&amp;#39;t want any of this we&amp;#39;re keeping our</text>
  <text start="1123.779" dur="4.74">own health insurance the staffers in the</text>
  <text start="1126.69" dur="3.93">government said this is too expensive we</text>
  <text start="1128.519" dur="4.071">can&amp;#39;t afford this we can&amp;#39;t take this so</text>
  <text start="1130.62" dur="4.32">Obama went out and said you know what</text>
  <text start="1132.59" dur="5.86">you&amp;#39;re exempt the government will pay</text>
  <text start="1134.94" dur="5.52">for it so we can see right now this is</text>
  <text start="1138.45" dur="3.63">not to help the American people and if</text>
  <text start="1140.46" dur="3.63">it was truly to help the American people</text>
  <text start="1142.08" dur="3.36">the government officials and the</text>
  <text start="1144.09" dur="3.9">president would have been on the front</text>
  <text start="1145.44" dur="4.469">line at the computer saying I just</text>
  <text start="1147.99" dur="4.83">signed up but we didn&amp;#39;t see anything</text>
  <text start="1149.909" dur="4.77">like that whatsoever because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1152.82" dur="3.27">want it and if they don&amp;#39;t want it I</text>
  <text start="1154.679" dur="5.281">don&amp;#39;t want it and none of you should</text>
  <text start="1156.09" dur="7.469">want it now we understand that illegals</text>
  <text start="1159.96" dur="5.25">are coming up from the Central America</text>
  <text start="1163.559" dur="4.531">on the train called the Beast which is</text>
  <text start="1165.21" dur="4.98">they can&amp;#39;t which Kansas City corporation</text>
  <text start="1168.09" dur="4.829">owns and we understand that the Obama</text>
  <text start="1170.19" dur="5.64">administration is now advertising down</text>
  <text start="1172.919" dur="5.311">in that area and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="1175.83" dur="4.349">that the children coming up and I said</text>
  <text start="1178.23" dur="3.72">this many times before are not children</text>
  <text start="1180.179" dur="4.38">but now we&amp;#39;re getting a breakdown of the</text>
  <text start="1181.95" dur="5.01">age groups and they are roughly between</text>
  <text start="1184.559" dur="5.49">fifteen and seventeen and some of them</text>
  <text start="1186.96" dur="4.98">are even 22 and what this and when I</text>
  <text start="1190.049" dur="5.37">look at this and what this occurs what</text>
  <text start="1191.94" dur="7.8">it would occur to me is that this age is</text>
  <text start="1195.419" dur="7.021">perfect working age it&amp;#39;s also perfect to</text>
  <text start="1199.74" dur="4.59">help Obama care because this is this is</text>
  <text start="1202.44" dur="4.709">the age group that he wanted in</text>
  <text start="1204.33" dur="5.55">Obamacare to support the Obama care</text>
  <text start="1207.149" dur="5.131">system it&amp;#39;s also a great age to</text>
  <text start="1209.88" dur="4.98">off to war once the war gets started and</text>
  <text start="1212.28" dur="4.44">we can see that this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="1214.86" dur="4.8">perfect they send them around the</text>
  <text start="1216.72" dur="5.28">country they have young people ready to</text>
  <text start="1219.66" dur="4.65">go ready to work at the low-paying jobs</text>
  <text start="1222" dur="5.7">ready to go right on to Obamacare with</text>
  <text start="1224.31" dur="6.9">subsidies and if war and I should say if</text>
  <text start="1227.7" dur="5.58">when war breaks out these individuals</text>
  <text start="1231.21" dur="5.76">are ready to fight they have an army and</text>
  <text start="1233.28" dur="7.41">we can see that this fits right into all</text>
  <text start="1236.97" dur="6.75">of their plans now it looks like the CIA</text>
  <text start="1240.69" dur="4.74">was caught in a complete lie anyone</text>
  <text start="1243.72" dur="4.29">really surprised they were spying on</text>
  <text start="1245.43" dur="4.65">Senate computers they lied about torture</text>
  <text start="1248.01" dur="5.16">they pretty much every time a government</text>
  <text start="1250.08" dur="5.58">official gets and testifies in front of</text>
  <text start="1253.17" dur="4.83">Congress you can pretty much know it&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="1566.26" dur="5.37">to everyone around the world saying okay</text>
  <text start="1568.81" dur="6.51">because we understand the story now is</text>
  <text start="1571.63" dur="5.52">losing traction from videos and</text>
  <text start="1575.32" dur="4.11">everything else that you can see on the</text>

  <text start="1582.4" dur="4.59">to push the people out they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1584.23" dur="4.86">them returned and now we can see from</text>
  <text start="1586.99" dur="3.9">the protests all around the world that</text>
  <text start="1589.09" dur="4.29">the message is getting out that this has</text>
  <text start="1590.89" dur="4.19">nothing to do with anything except</text>
  <text start="1593.38" dur="4.38">demolishing and removing the</text>
  <text start="1595.08" dur="4.78">Palestinians from this area and you have</text>
  <text start="1597.76" dur="4.68">to remember they are trying to get to</text>
  <text start="1599.86" dur="6.99">that natural gas and the 1.6 billion</text>
  <text start="1602.44" dur="7.04">dollars worth of oil off the coast Hamas</text>
  <text start="1606.85" dur="4.76">was making a deal with Russia</text>
  <text start="1609.48" dur="4.5">and the Israeli government would have no</text>
  <text start="1611.61" dur="5.64">access to that whatsoever so they need</text>
  <text start="1613.98" dur="5.579">to remove and D Palestine the entire</text>
  <text start="1617.25" dur="4.799">area right now and you can see by the</text>
  <text start="1619.559" dur="7.681">destruction and from what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1622.049" dur="6.931">this is exactly their mission now Hamas</text>
  <text start="1627.24" dur="4.62">is out there and they&amp;#39;re demanding all</text>

  <text start="1646.44" dur="3.6">there and talk about the ceasefire and</text>
  <text start="1648.45" dur="3.84">you have to remember Hamas said listen</text>
  <text start="1650.04" dur="5.58">we want Russia to broker the deal here</text>
  <text start="1652.29" dur="5.49">and we can see that this might happen</text>
  <text start="1655.62" dur="4.62">because we understand that the United</text>
  <text start="1657.78" dur="5.73">States now with Israel saying well if we</text>
  <text start="1660.24" dur="5.939">remove Hamas the Islamic state might</text>
  <text start="1663.51" dur="5.039">move into this territory and it might be</text>
  <text start="1666.179" dur="6.87">a lot worse than just having Hamas there</text>
  <text start="1668.549" dur="7.141">the story is losing traction there what</text>
  <text start="1673.049" dur="5.431">is happening in the area is disgusting</text>
