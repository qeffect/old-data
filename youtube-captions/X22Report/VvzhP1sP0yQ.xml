  <text start="47.52" dur="5.53">hi and welcome you&amp;#39;re listening to the x</text>
  <text start="51.13" dur="5.61">22 report my name is dave and this is</text>
  <text start="53.05" dur="6.75">episode 1121 be and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="56.74" dur="5.16">november 7 2016 and thought of the</text>
  <text start="59.8" dur="4.17">episode is everything is now in place</text>
  <text start="61.9" dur="6.15">for the deep state to manipulate the</text>
  <text start="63.97" dur="6.71">election let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="68.05" dur="5.91">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="70.68" dur="5.65">now we talked a lot about Obamacare and</text>
  <text start="73.96" dur="5.73">people are starting to really wake up</text>
  <text start="76.33" dur="5.25">and realize that Obamacare it is not a</text>
  <text start="79.69" dur="4.86">benefit to the people whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="81.58" dur="4.53">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the people</text>
  <text start="84.55" dur="3.78">who&amp;#39;ve joined up to Obamacare well</text>
  <text start="86.11" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re starting to revolt and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="88.33" dur="4.53">saying that listen we don&amp;#39;t have this</text>
  <text start="89.83" dur="6.03">kind of money to spend and most of the</text>
  <text start="92.86" dur="6.119">people they are shying away from going</text>
  <text start="95.86" dur="5.58">to the doctor now and we can see this is</text>
  <text start="98.979" dur="5.071">not a good thing because those people</text>
  <text start="101.44" dur="5.85">who need care they need to visit the</text>
  <text start="104.05" dur="5.13">doctor for example michelle harris is 61</text>
  <text start="107.29" dur="4.47">years old retired waitress in Northwest</text>
  <text start="109.18" dur="4.86">Montana has arthritis in both shoulders</text>
  <text start="111.76" dur="5.58">but is doing everything she can to avoid</text>
  <text start="114.04" dur="5.91">seeing the doctor because she has a 45</text>
  <text start="117.34" dur="6.15">hundred dollar deductible and a 338</text>
  <text start="119.95" dur="5.88">dollar a month payment under her blue</text>
  <text start="123.49" dur="4.559">cross blue shield plan and what that</text>
  <text start="125.83" dur="3.539">means is she has to pay three hundred</text>
  <text start="128.049" dur="3.931">and thirty dollars every single month</text>
  <text start="129.369" dur="5.581">and if she goes to the doctor she still</text>
  <text start="131.98" dur="4.86">has to lay out the cash first to meet</text>
  <text start="134.95" dur="4.56">the deductible of forty five hundred</text>
  <text start="136.84" dur="4.29">dollars so if she goes to the doctor and</text>
  <text start="139.51" dur="3.99">the doctor build is two hundred fifty</text>
  <text start="141.13" dur="4.95">dollars she has to pay 250 tells the</text>
  <text start="143.5" dur="4.47">insurance kicks in absolutely nothing if</text>
  <text start="146.08" dur="3.96">she goes to the doctor again and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="147.97" dur="4.95">another 250 she has to keep paying out</text>
  <text start="150.04" dur="6.24">250 until she reaches 45 hundred dollars</text>
  <text start="152.92" dur="5.39">within that year while paying the three</text>
  <text start="156.28" dur="5.73">hundred and thirty-eight dollars a month</text>
  <text start="158.31" dur="5.649">for her and a lot of people are starting</text>
  <text start="162.01" dur="5.88">to realize that this is not really</text>
  <text start="163.959" dur="6">helping me this is very expensive and</text>
  <text start="167.89" dur="4.23">people are starting to revolt and say</text>
  <text start="169.959" dur="3.81">you know something I don&amp;#39;t think we</text>
  <text start="172.12" dur="3.03">should have but Obama care anymore and</text>
  <text start="173.769" dur="4.051">especially those people who are paying</text>
  <text start="175.15" dur="5.79">penalties now are saying why am I being</text>
  <text start="177.82" dur="6.06">penalized for something that I did</text>
  <text start="180.94" dur="5.61">side I don&amp;#39;t want and the government</text>
  <text start="183.88" dur="6.56">should have no right to force you into</text>
  <text start="186.55" dur="7.76">doing something you don&amp;#39;t want to do</text>
  <text start="190.44" dur="6.82">well we see the United States right now</text>
  <text start="194.31" dur="5.53">where everyone believes that the United</text>
  <text start="197.26" dur="4.53">States is not corrupt for those people</text>
  <text start="199.84" dur="3.39">who aren&amp;#39;t paying attention but when we</text>
  <text start="201.79" dur="4.62">look closely we know the United States</text>
  <text start="203.23" dur="5.88">the politicians they&amp;#39;re all corrupt all</text>
  <text start="206.41" dur="5.37">right i&amp;#39;ll say 99.999% of them are</text>
  <text start="209.11" dur="5.31">corrupt and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="211.78" dur="7.77">the United States has dropped in its</text>
  <text start="214.42" dur="8.52">rankings from 142 to 158 for the most</text>
  <text start="219.55" dur="6.3">corrupt country in 2016 for global</text>
  <text start="222.94" dur="5.82">transparency and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="225.85" dur="6.09">that the United States continually drops</text>
  <text start="228.76" dur="5.1">in its rankings so when people say oh we</text>
  <text start="231.94" dur="7.05">have the transparent government we are</text>
  <text start="233.86" dur="9">not corrupt it is simply not true we see</text>
  <text start="238.99" dur="7.26">out in the UK people are very angry we</text>
  <text start="242.86" dur="6.81">see that the powers that be the central</text>
  <text start="246.25" dur="6.42">bank&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re trying to stop the</text>
  <text start="249.67" dur="9.12">trigger of article 50 now we can see</text>
  <text start="252.67" dur="9.78">that Elizabeth May is going to push hard</text>
  <text start="258.79" dur="5.94">to try to trigger trigger article 50 but</text>
  <text start="262.45" dur="4.17">we see right now that because of the</text>
  <text start="264.73" dur="4.02">court ruling they have to go through</text>
  <text start="266.62" dur="7.89">Parliament and Parliament has to vote so</text>
  <text start="268.75" dur="8.58">right now the central bank&amp;#39;s they are</text>
  <text start="274.51" dur="6.24">doing whatever they possibly can to stop</text>
  <text start="277.33" dur="5.04">this remember this was only an advisory</text>
  <text start="280.75" dur="3.75">referendum that they had out in the UK</text>
  <text start="282.37" dur="3.81">this is the will of the people but</text>
  <text start="284.5" dur="5.25">central banks don&amp;#39;t follow the will of</text>
  <text start="286.18" dur="6.42">the people they follow in what they want</text>
  <text start="289.75" dur="6.09">and they want all these countries to be</text>
  <text start="292.6" dur="5.88">slaves to the central bank and I would</text>
  <text start="295.84" dur="6.39">be shocked if they&amp;#39;re able to trigger</text>
  <text start="298.48" dur="5.97">article 50 because the central bank will</text>
  <text start="302.23" dur="5.13">do whatever they possibly can to stop</text>
  <text start="304.45" dur="4.35">this and if they do stop this that</text>
  <text start="307.36" dur="3.27">people are going to feel like they were</text>
  <text start="308.8" dur="4.56">cheated they&amp;#39;re going to feel like</text>
  <text start="310.63" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re portrayed and you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="313.36" dur="4.7">see angry</text>
  <text start="314.56" dur="9.329">individuals and you might even see</text>
  <text start="318.06" dur="9.4">riding a civil war and the government is</text>
  <text start="323.889" dur="6.121">going to have problems this is what</text>
  <text start="327.46" dur="7.86">happens when you go and you force people</text>
  <text start="330.01" dur="7.23">into a corner people get angry pissed</text>
  <text start="335.32" dur="3.599">off and they realize well wait a minute</text>
  <text start="337.24" dur="3.99">you&amp;#39;re not working for the people</text>
  <text start="338.919" dur="4.831">anymore and we see this here in the</text>
  <text start="341.23" dur="5.52">United States this is why people are</text>
  <text start="343.75" dur="5.1">angry today because they see what they</text>
  <text start="346.75" dur="4.47">establish Minh has done those people</text>
  <text start="348.85" dur="5.34">have woken up those people who are out</text>
  <text start="351.22" dur="6">there looking at what is happening they</text>
  <text start="354.19" dur="4.11">realize we can&amp;#39;t go on like this now</text>
  <text start="357.22" dur="3.54">there are many people that are still</text>
  <text start="358.3" dur="5.22">asleep they believe that everything is</text>
  <text start="360.76" dur="5.67">fine well they&amp;#39;re going to find out that</text>
  <text start="363.52" dur="6.75">it isn&amp;#39;t I mean this is completely</text>
  <text start="366.43" dur="7.08">evident with the US USA Freedom Act now</text>
  <text start="370.27" dur="4.649">remember when the NSA got caught spying</text>
  <text start="373.51" dur="2.969">on the people of course they lie to the</text>
  <text start="374.919" dur="5.761">people but no one had a problem with</text>
  <text start="376.479" dur="6.211">that well except for myself all of you</text>
  <text start="380.68" dur="3.33">listening and many on the alternative</text>
  <text start="382.69" dur="4.26">media but the corporate media really</text>
  <text start="384.01" dur="5.219">didn&amp;#39;t have a problem with that but they</text>
  <text start="386.95" dur="4.44">lied to the American people that they</text>
  <text start="389.229" dur="7.231">were spying and violating the Fourth</text>
  <text start="391.39" dur="7.02">Amendment and no one really had a</text>
  <text start="396.46" dur="4.11">problem with this so the president came</text>
  <text start="398.41" dur="4.65">out and said listen we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="400.57" dur="5.49">major reforms to calm the situation down</text>
  <text start="403.06" dur="5.37">and what did they do while they came up</text>
  <text start="406.06" dur="4.05">with the USA Freedom Act where they</text>
  <text start="408.43" dur="4.049">decided listen we won&amp;#39;t spy on the</text>
  <text start="410.11" dur="4.95">people will let the corporation spy on</text>
  <text start="412.479" dur="5.521">the people and we&amp;#39;ll get the information</text>
  <text start="415.06" dur="7.46">well since that time period back in June</text>
  <text start="418" dur="8.25">of 2015 when it became law guess what</text>
  <text start="422.52" dur="6.58">unwarranted surveillance has not</text>
  <text start="426.25" dur="7.919">decreased its increased actually it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="429.1" dur="10.97">lot worse today than it was before the</text>
  <text start="434.169" dur="9">USA Freedom Act so all they did was</text>
  <text start="440.07" dur="7.779">transfer the spine to companies like</text>
  <text start="443.169" dur="10.76">AT&amp;amp;T sprint verizon and they use AC</text>
  <text start="447.849" dur="9.84">fisa court to get the information and</text>
  <text start="453.929" dur="6.431">this court allows them to say yes you</text>
  <text start="457.689" dur="4.38">can now they&amp;#39;re going to say yes we do</text>
  <text start="460.36" dur="4.649">get the information but we don&amp;#39;t look at</text>
  <text start="462.069" dur="5.43">the American side of the conversations</text>
  <text start="465.009" dur="3.99">we only look at the foreign sides we</text>
  <text start="467.499" dur="3.331">don&amp;#39;t look at the metadata we you know</text>
  <text start="468.999" dur="4.38">they make up all these excuses and</text>
  <text start="470.83" dur="7.139">really what&amp;#39;s coming out of all of this</text>
  <text start="473.379" dur="6.75">is that the spying has increased on the</text>
  <text start="477.969" dur="4.53">American people because we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="480.129" dur="4.171">listening to it we know they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="482.499" dur="6.41">at it we know the metadata gives them a</text>
  <text start="484.3" dur="8.009">lot of information and all they did was</text>
  <text start="488.909" dur="5.02">transfer who is spying on the people</text>
  <text start="492.309" dur="3.84">because they realized it&amp;#39;s a lot easier</text>
  <text start="493.929" dur="4.74">for the companies to give us the</text>
  <text start="496.149" dur="6.39">information then the government to</text>
  <text start="498.669" dur="9.27">access their network to get the</text>
  <text start="502.539" dur="7.98">information AT&amp;amp;T sprint verizon they</text>
  <text start="507.939" dur="6.54">already have it built in they already</text>
  <text start="510.519" dur="7.231">written software for this and we can see</text>
  <text start="514.479" dur="6.6">right now this again is a violation of</text>
  <text start="517.75" dur="5.189">the Fourth Amendment so whatever they</text>
  <text start="521.079" dur="3.24">tell us that you know this is for the</text>
  <text start="522.939" dur="4.2">best interest of the people now it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="524.319" dur="5.311">best interest for them the authorities</text>
  <text start="527.139" dur="4.861">and they use fancy terms on their bills</text>
  <text start="529.63" dur="3.99">as we know it&amp;#39;s always the opposite USA</text>
  <text start="532" dur="3.269">Freedom Act that has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="533.62" dur="4.409">freedom the Patriot Act has nothing to</text>
  <text start="535.269" dur="4.161">do a patriotism Affordable Care Act has</text>
  <text start="538.029" dur="5.55">nothing to do with the affordability</text>
  <text start="539.43" dur="6.79">these are all terms they use to create</text>
  <text start="543.579" dur="4.831">the perception that they are working for</text>
  <text start="546.22" dur="5.34">the people when in fact they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="548.41" dur="4.56">the exact opposite now at this point we</text>
  <text start="551.56" dur="3.57">all realize that the United States</text>
  <text start="552.97" dur="4.859">government central bankers they are</text>
  <text start="555.13" dur="4.53">ready and prepared for war they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="557.829" dur="4.5">going to back down they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="559.66" dur="4.65">stop they realize the economy is failing</text>
  <text start="562.329" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s deteriorating very very quickly</text>
  <text start="564.31" dur="6.529">we&amp;#39;re moving towards the endgame here</text>
  <text start="567.009" dur="6.63">and we can see ready that with all the</text>
  <text start="570.839" dur="5.591">movement of military assets troops</text>
  <text start="573.639" dur="5.521">around the world they are now prepared</text>
  <text start="576.43" dur="4.84">to push this war forward we see that</text>
  <text start="579.16" dur="5.2">NATO right now there</text>
  <text start="581.27" dur="8.01">putting 300 and 300 thousand troops on</text>
  <text start="584.36" dur="7.83">high alert of course amid fears of some</text>
  <text start="589.28" dur="5.07">type of confrontation with Russia and we</text>
  <text start="592.19" dur="5.49">see right now that everything is going</text>
  <text start="594.35" dur="4.77">on high alert and the reason why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="597.68" dur="3.87">doing this is they&amp;#39;re preparing and</text>
  <text start="599.12" dur="4.17">getting ready for what is coming out in</text>
  <text start="601.55" dur="4.47">the Middle East what are we saying well</text>
  <text start="603.29" dur="4.14">the situation is getting worse for the</text>
  <text start="606.02" dur="3.81">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="607.43" dur="6.18">and what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is create</text>
  <text start="609.83" dur="7.2">a space in the Middle East where they</text>
  <text start="613.61" dur="6.75">can break off portions of Iraq and Syria</text>
  <text start="617.03" dur="6.6">and create a brand new country and this</text>
  <text start="620.36" dur="7.44">is what they&amp;#39;ve been doing out in my</text>

  <text start="817.67" dur="3.75">Syria out of Aleppo this is why they</text>
  <text start="819.32" dur="3.78">brought in a lot more Islamic state</text>
  <text start="821.42" dur="4.5">soldiers this is why they&amp;#39;ve been making</text>
  <text start="823.1" dur="5.67">an offensive in Aleppo but it has not</text>
  <text start="825.92" dur="6.03">been working so turkey and the u.s. they</text>
  <text start="828.77" dur="6.63">have agreed on a learn long-term plan to</text>
  <text start="831.95" dur="6.21">capture and govern rocca because we can</text>
  <text start="835.4" dur="5.55">see already the offensive has started</text>
  <text start="838.16" dur="4.86">and they&amp;#39;re planning to season hold this</text>
  <text start="840.95" dur="5.73">entire area they&amp;#39;re going to be calling</text>
  <text start="843.02" dur="5.879">it the capital for the moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="846.68" dur="3.87">because what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is</text>
  <text start="848.899" dur="2.97">going to break it off and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="850.55" dur="4.199">to say to Russia I&amp;#39;m going to say to</text>

  <text start="870.769" dur="7.711">to fly but we will see what happens</text>
  <text start="872.559" dur="10.051">because at this point Russia might talk</text>
  <text start="878.48" dur="6.359">to the United States to avoid war</text>
  <text start="882.61" dur="4.959">because as we can see from the actions</text>
  <text start="884.839" dur="5.131">of Russia if they really wanted war and</text>
  <text start="887.569" dur="5.791">this was all about going to war and they</text>
  <text start="889.97" dur="6.059">were all part of the war effort they</text>
  <text start="893.36" dur="4.289">could have had war at any time I mean</text>
  <text start="896.029" dur="2.79">think about when turkey shot down the</text>
  <text start="897.649" dur="3.18">Russian plane we could have had world</text>
  <text start="898.819" dur="3.661">world war three right there they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="900.829" dur="4.521">have to wait actually if we go back to</text>
  <text start="902.48" dur="7.589">2013 when the United States brought in</text>
  <text start="905.35" dur="6.429">the aircraft carriers the submarines and</text>
  <text start="910.069" dur="4.68">they were ready to go into Syria with</text>

  <text start="916.639" dur="4.231">have said okay World War 3 has started</text>
  <text start="918.319" dur="7.08">let&amp;#39;s do it but they haven&amp;#39;t they could</text>
  <text start="920.87" dur="5.879">have done it in Ukraine but again it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="925.399" dur="4.891">not because the United States has pulled</text>
  <text start="926.749" dur="5.82">back it&amp;#39;s because Russia through their</text>
  <text start="930.29" dur="3.87">actions not the words of the</text>
  <text start="932.569" dur="4.981">propagandists here in the United States</text>
  <text start="934.16" dur="5.82">through actions they have avoided war</text>
  <text start="937.55" dur="4.649">each time but it&amp;#39;s getting harder and</text>
  <text start="939.98" dur="3.87">harder to do because when someone is</text>
  <text start="942.199" dur="4.171">pushing for war they will do whatever</text>
  <text start="943.85" dur="4.169">they have to to get war started and if</text>
  <text start="946.37" dur="3.839">they can&amp;#39;t get the other side to start a</text>
  <text start="948.019" dur="4.13">war they&amp;#39;ll do it for them I mean look</text>
  <text start="950.209" dur="4.98">what&amp;#39;s happening now with the elections</text>
  <text start="952.149" dur="5.711">the United States has used the</text>
  <text start="955.189" dur="5.46">propaganda that Russia has cyber attack</text>
  <text start="957.86" dur="5.099">the DNC and the election system and we</text>
  <text start="960.649" dur="3.78">know this is fake phony and false we</text>
  <text start="962.959" dur="3.781">know that there&amp;#39;s no way that they</text>
  <text start="964.429" dur="5.1">tracked it back to Russia in a couple of</text>
  <text start="966.74" dur="5.939">days that they announced it first of all</text>
  <text start="969.529" dur="4.891">it would take a very long time for them</text>
  <text start="972.679" dur="3.9">to try to track this down I mean think</text>
  <text start="974.42" dur="4.37">about it we just had a cyber attack in</text>
  <text start="976.579" dur="4.74">the northeastern area where we had a</text>
  <text start="978.79" dur="3.26">denial service attack which brought down</text>
  <text start="981.319" dur="3.761">a lot of</text>

  <text start="985.08" dur="3.5">government so far have they announced</text>
  <text start="986.73" dur="5.31">who has done it they have no clue</text>
  <text start="988.58" dur="7.11">because they bounce it off of servers</text>
  <text start="992.04" dur="7.62">offer servers they take control of</text>
  <text start="995.69" dur="7.03">computer systems servers other devices</text>
  <text start="999.66" dur="5.91">that are connected to the Internet to do</text>
  <text start="1002.72" dur="4.799">what they need to be done and right now</text>
  <text start="1005.57" dur="4.11">the United States just coming off and</text>
  <text start="1007.519" dur="3.301">saying that hey we know is Russia we</text>

  <text start="1013.04" dur="6.26">there is absolutely no way especially</text>

  <text start="1019.3" dur="3.88">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="1020.959" dur="4.801">everything that they&amp;#39;re doing they are</text>
  <text start="1023.18" dur="4.92">using for a specific reason when they</text>
  <text start="1025.76" dur="4.23">say Russia has attacked the DNC in the</text>
  <text start="1028.1" dur="4.77">election system they needed that</text>
  <text start="1029.99" dur="5.49">information out there they need to bring</text>
  <text start="1032.87" dur="5.01">Russia into the war remember they want a</text>

  <text start="1037.88" dur="4.799">do something they will do it for them to</text>
  <text start="1040.209" dur="4.931">convince the American people that yes</text>
  <text start="1042.679" dur="3.871">this is why we&amp;#39;re going to war so</text>
  <text start="1045.14" dur="3.6">everything that has been done right now</text>
  <text start="1046.55" dur="5.67">is on purpose now think about this for a</text>

  <text start="1075.05" dur="5.85">likely there was a crime committed there</text>
  <text start="1076.73" dur="7.829">maybe even treason but the FBI decided</text>
  <text start="1080.9" dur="6.54">okay listen will reopen the case we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1084.559" dur="6.651">look at these new emails now remember</text>
  <text start="1087.44" dur="9.3">everything they&amp;#39;re doing is to create</text>

  <text start="1158.33" dur="10.19">we&amp;#39;re looking at this and then they say</text>
  <text start="1163.88" dur="8.36">there&amp;#39;s no evidence of criminal behavior</text>

  <text start="1194.2" dur="6.25">they played the manipulation game this</text>
  <text start="1198.83" dur="4.31">is part of the manipulation game not</text>
  <text start="1200.45" dur="6.3">just manipulating the election results</text>
  <text start="1203.14" dur="8.529">but manipulating what people perceive</text>
  <text start="1206.75" dur="7.89">and this is exactly what they did this</text>
  <text start="1211.669" dur="7.171">is part of the SIOP and they did it on</text>
  <text start="1214.64" dur="8.789">purpose because what I&amp;#39;m seeing right</text>
  <text start="1218.84" dur="8.01">now is they have everything in place to</text>
  <text start="1223.429" dur="7.831">get their candidate into power now the</text>
  <text start="1226.85" dur="6.3">only thing that might stop their</text>
  <text start="1231.26" dur="7.169">candidate getting it getting into power</text>
  <text start="1233.15" dur="7.889">is if there is a landslide of the</text>

  <text start="1242.409" dur="4.27">manipulation it just can&amp;#39;t handle it</text>
  <text start="1244.82" dur="4.53">because if there&amp;#39;s millions of people</text>
  <text start="1246.679" dur="4.531">going towards Trump</text>
  <text start="1249.35" dur="4.47">and I know there&amp;#39;s a the electoral</text>

  <text start="1253.82" dur="5.37">electoral cards is college is already</text>
  <text start="1255.65" dur="6.87">taken care of the problem is is when the</text>
  <text start="1259.19" dur="5.91">manipulation of I mean the popular vote</text>
  <text start="1262.52" dur="5.519">is way out of whack and I&amp;#39;m talking way</text>

  <text start="1268.039" dur="4.291">this is where they&amp;#39;re going to run into</text>
  <text start="1269.75" dur="4.98">the problem this is where the problem</text>
  <text start="1272.33" dur="4.74">comes in because they can manipulate but</text>
  <text start="1274.73" dur="6.329">only so far this is why they put into</text>
  <text start="1277.07" dur="6.45">place those other plans and it&amp;#39;s part of</text>
  <text start="1281.059" dur="6.24">the SIOP of the election where they will</text>
  <text start="1283.52" dur="8.19">have some type of cyber attack they will</text>

  <text start="1317" dur="3.87">say it&amp;#39;s a complete redo which I think</text>
  <text start="1319.46" dur="7.65">they might do because then they can</text>
  <text start="1320.87" dur="9.929">reprogram the systems to handle what</text>
  <text start="1327.11" dur="5.67">just happened and this way they can say</text>
  <text start="1330.799" dur="7.411">well those other results were because of</text>
