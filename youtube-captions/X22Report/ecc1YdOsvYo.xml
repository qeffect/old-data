  <text start="292.33" dur="3.51">people believe that Trump has moved to</text>
  <text start="294.16" dur="6.09">the dark side he&amp;#39;s controlled by the</text>
  <text start="295.84" dur="6.389">deep state and they are basically using</text>
  <text start="300.25" dur="4.5">him as a puppet now maybe that&amp;#39;s true</text>

  <text start="327.57" dur="5.21">orders changing this doing this well</text>
  <text start="330.419" dur="4.351">maybe in his own company that works</text>
  <text start="332.78" dur="3.34">corporations he&amp;#39;s the boss he tells</text>
  <text start="334.77" dur="4.53">people what to do and they just do it</text>
  <text start="336.12" dur="6.72">the government is run by wait a minute</text>
  <text start="339.3" dur="7.35">the deep state they&amp;#39;re in control the</text>
  <text start="342.84" dur="6.51">central bank is in control is he gonna</text>

  <text start="351.96" dur="4.62">can tell that plan didn&amp;#39;t work it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="354.18" dur="4.709">work at all the corporate media was not</text>

  <text start="358.889" dur="4.801">him the deep state was not with him they</text>
  <text start="361.35" dur="3.75">were against him and if you really</text>
  <text start="363.69" dur="2.97">thought that he was going to go in there</text>
  <text start="365.1" dur="3.99">and just do it just bring back the jobs</text>
  <text start="366.66" dur="5.64">and all the manufacturing while having</text>
  <text start="369.09" dur="5.67">this system in place well that was never</text>
  <text start="372.3" dur="6.179">going to work so what is he doing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="374.76" dur="5.879">playing a game he needs to get down to</text>
  <text start="378.479" dur="4.56">their level he&amp;#39;s a smart guy I mean</text>
  <text start="380.639" dur="4.141">everyone&amp;#39;s like oh he turned and now</text>
  <text start="383.039" dur="3.871">we&amp;#39;re angry with him you don&amp;#39;t be angry</text>
  <text start="384.78" dur="4.71">and I&amp;#39;m not saying he&amp;#39;s the best guy in</text>
  <text start="386.91" dur="5.31">the world he&amp;#39;s a savior or anything like</text>
  <text start="389.49" dur="6.27">that whatsoever I&amp;#39;m looking at what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="392.22" dur="7.11">actually doing for example when he was</text>
  <text start="395.76" dur="5.879">campaigning what did he do he basically</text>
  <text start="399.33" dur="4.62">called out the Fed for zero interest</text>
  <text start="401.639" dur="4.111">rate policy he explained how the Fed</text>
  <text start="403.95" dur="4.71">zero interest rate policy hurt</text>
  <text start="405.75" dur="6.18">responsible savers who now receive next</text>
  <text start="408.66" dur="4.68">to nothing from deposit accounts and you</text>
  <text start="411.93" dur="3.6">might remember a few weeks ago the wall</text>
  <text start="413.34" dur="5.579">street journal published an estimate of</text>
  <text start="415.53" dur="6.6">how much this policy has costs savers</text>
  <text start="418.919" dur="6.511">the article tally the cost to savers at</text>
  <text start="422.13" dur="5.52">1 trillion dollars that&amp;#39;s the money</text>
  <text start="425.43" dur="5.01">savers could have earned from deposits</text>
  <text start="427.65" dur="4.92">padding retirement accounts and flowing</text>
  <text start="430.44" dur="3.99">it back into the economy but because</text>
  <text start="432.57" dur="4.469">interest rates are so low this didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="434.43" dur="4.709">happen so the Fen has begun to prepare</text>
  <text start="437.039" dur="3.961">investors for higher interest rates</text>
  <text start="439.139" dur="4.71">remember they raise the rate in 2015 in</text>
  <text start="441" dur="5.159">December again in 2016 in December and</text>
  <text start="443.849" dur="3.961">they&amp;#39;re raising it again in they did in</text>
  <text start="446.159" dur="2.771">February of 2017 and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="447.81" dur="5.77">raise it again</text>
  <text start="448.93" dur="6.66">and the Fed said Wow okay Trump said low</text>
  <text start="453.58" dur="4.649">interest rates aren&amp;#39;t good let&amp;#39;s start</text>
  <text start="455.59" dur="5.31">raising the interest rates now we looked</text>
  <text start="458.229" dur="5.25">at what they did in other periods of</text>
  <text start="460.9" dur="5.82">time where the Fed raised the interest</text>
  <text start="463.479" dur="4.861">rates and it crashed the economy so</text>
  <text start="466.72" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re going along with Trump saying</text>
  <text start="468.34" dur="5.16">okay let&amp;#39;s do what he&amp;#39;s saying let&amp;#39;s do</text>
  <text start="471.4" dur="4.29">exactly what he said during his campaign</text>
  <text start="473.5" dur="6.27">we will start raising the interest rates</text>
  <text start="475.69" dur="9.449">and this way we can blame it all on him</text>
  <text start="479.77" dur="7.17">what a fool he is so the Fed the central</text>
  <text start="485.139" dur="4.56">bank they started raising interest rates</text>
  <text start="486.94" dur="6.93">and it was going along with what Trump</text>
  <text start="489.699" dur="6.511">has said now Trump came out and he said</text>
  <text start="493.87" dur="6.24">something completely different remember</text>
  <text start="496.21" dur="7.35">he said feds the feds low interest rate</text>
  <text start="500.11" dur="6.239">that policy was a complete disaster but</text>
  <text start="503.56" dur="6.12">last week Trump turned the tables on</text>
  <text start="506.349" dur="5.281">Yellen Trump made it clear that higher</text>
  <text start="509.68" dur="5.43">interest rates and the recent strength</text>
  <text start="511.63" dur="8.43">in the US dollar was bad for the US</text>
  <text start="515.11" dur="7.26">economy he just tricked the Fed now</text>
  <text start="520.06" dur="5.01">remember we said this for quite a while</text>
  <text start="522.37" dur="5.43">the central bank does not want to be</text>
  <text start="525.07" dur="5.13">blamed for this collapse they were</text>
  <text start="527.8" dur="5.82">setting it up for Trump to take the</text>
  <text start="530.2" dur="5.19">blame because during his campaign he was</text>
  <text start="533.62" dur="3.99">telling everyone about the low interest</text>
  <text start="535.39" dur="3.449">rates how it was a disaster so the Fed</text>
  <text start="537.61" dur="3.09">said okay we&amp;#39;ll start raising the</text>
  <text start="538.839" dur="4.111">interest rates we&amp;#39;re doing what you tell</text>
  <text start="540.7" dur="5.73">us to do here we&amp;#39;re following along in</text>
  <text start="542.95" dur="7.05">your economic policies now Trump did a</text>
  <text start="546.43" dur="6.84">180 turn the tables on yelling and said</text>
  <text start="550" dur="5.459">yeah you know what I looked at it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="553.27" dur="5.34">the opposite the low interest rates were</text>
  <text start="555.459" dur="5.851">good and the strong dollar not so good</text>
  <text start="558.61" dur="4.05">we need to lower the dollar well the Fed</text>
  <text start="561.31" dur="5.94">already started raising interest rates</text>
  <text start="562.66" dur="8.4">he just turned everything around to be</text>
  <text start="567.25" dur="5.3">blamed on the Fed that&amp;#39;s exactly what he</text>
  <text start="571.06" dur="5.149">just did right now because he</text>
  <text start="572.55" dur="7.75">understands that this economy right now</text>
  <text start="576.209" dur="6.201">cannot exist the way it is the jobs he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="580.3" dur="5.709">been talking about the manufacture</text>
  <text start="582.41" dur="5.609">into manufacturing facilities all of</text>
  <text start="586.009" dur="6.091">this cannot come back to the United</text>
  <text start="588.019" dur="6.541">States we cannot reset the system if the</text>
  <text start="592.1" dur="4.979">central bank is in charge if the deep</text>
  <text start="594.56" dur="6.12">state is in charge and if the system is</text>
  <text start="597.079" dur="6.51">run the way it is it&amp;#39;s impossible so how</text>
  <text start="600.68" dur="4.709">do you change things like this can you</text>
  <text start="603.589" dur="5.1">just come out and tell them that you</text>
  <text start="605.389" dur="6.12">need them changed know how does the deep</text>
  <text start="608.689" dur="4.981">state work to trick the American people</text>

  <text start="613.67" dur="4.409">point in time and you couldn&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="615.709" dur="3.87">that the deep state would do these</text>
  <text start="618.079" dur="3.24">things the government wouldn&amp;#39;t do these</text>
