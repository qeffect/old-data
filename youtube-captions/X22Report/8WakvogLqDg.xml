  <text start="216.76" dur="7.68">people and this is going to continue</text>
  <text start="221.5" dur="5.58">throughout the year and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="224.44" dur="4.019">get worse and worse as time goes on and</text>
  <text start="227.08" dur="3.36">people are scratching their heads like</text>
  <text start="228.459" dur="4.221">why is this happening the economy is</text>
  <text start="230.44" dur="6.24">improving unemployment&amp;#39;s very low</text>
  <text start="232.68" dur="7.54">housings fine retails fine no this is an</text>
  <text start="236.68" dur="8.91">illusion this is what the Fed created</text>
  <text start="240.22" dur="8.76">with their creation of money of currency</text>
  <text start="245.59" dur="5.55">and they fed this into the banks they</text>
  <text start="248.98" dur="4.979">fed this into all the hedge funds and</text>
  <text start="251.14" dur="5.909">investment companies and we can see it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="253.959" dur="6.511">taking its toll right now because these</text>
  <text start="257.049" dur="8.131">companies like IBM caterpillar sprint</text>
  <text start="260.47" dur="9.02">VMware Oracle and all the retail and</text>
  <text start="265.18" dur="7.71">manufacturing companies they are not</text>
  <text start="269.49" dur="6.55">producing they don&amp;#39;t have sales they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="272.89" dur="6.84">not bringing in the revenue the market</text>
  <text start="276.04" dur="6.03">is manipulated manipulated by the</text>
  <text start="279.73" dur="5.13">central bankers to make you think</text>
  <text start="282.07" dur="4.8">everything is ok and what always happens</text>
  <text start="284.86" dur="5.61">with a manipulated market with a</text>
  <text start="286.87" dur="7.2">manipulated economy it comes crashing</text>
  <text start="290.47" dur="5.28">down we&amp;#39;re already hearing the central</text>
  <text start="294.07" dur="3.179">bankers the US government telling us</text>
  <text start="295.75" dur="3.659">that things are fine</text>
  <text start="297.249" dur="3.54">everything is contained we heard this</text>
  <text start="299.409" dur="6.09">back in 2008</text>
  <text start="300.789" dur="7.38">the Dallas Fed came out and for the 13th</text>
  <text start="305.499" dur="8.1">month in a row guess what</text>
  <text start="308.169" dur="8.04">it has contracted we are headed for a</text>
  <text start="313.599" dur="8.9">deep deep depression</text>
  <text start="316.209" dur="11.31">I mean January collapsed to negative 24</text>
  <text start="322.499" dur="8.26">this is absolutely awful I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="327.519" dur="8.19">going into the territory which we saw</text>
  <text start="330.759" dur="9.33">back in 2008 2007 the end of 2007 going</text>
  <text start="335.709" dur="8.91">into 2008 we are already there it looks</text>
  <text start="340.089" dur="9.39">exactly the same there is no improvement</text>
  <text start="344.619" dur="9.241">whatsoever all hope is crushed in the</text>
  <text start="349.479" dur="9.18">Dallas Fed across-the-board production</text>
  <text start="353.86" dur="6.119">employment shipment all collapsing but</text>
  <text start="358.659" dur="6.33">don&amp;#39;t worry everything is fine</text>
  <text start="359.979" dur="8.91">no it&amp;#39;s not so far we&amp;#39;re hearing from</text>
  <text start="364.989" dur="8.76">every part of the economy it is not</text>
  <text start="368.889" dur="9.33">doing well but I must be peddling</text>
  <text start="373.749" dur="7.08">fiction because the president said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="378.219" dur="5.4">improving well I&amp;#39;m saying me out the</text>
  <text start="380.829" dur="5.85">opposite the economy is not improving</text>
  <text start="383.619" dur="5.88">and we have been tracking every little</text>
  <text start="386.679" dur="7.1">part of this economy and guess what it</text>
  <text start="389.499" dur="6.9">is not improving whatsoever</text>
  <text start="393.779" dur="5.71">Manufacturing right now is in a</text>
  <text start="396.399" dur="5.82">recession heading towards a deep</text>
  <text start="399.489" dur="6.39">depression the bolt of dry index is at</text>
  <text start="402.219" dur="7.41">its lowest point it continually</text>
  <text start="405.879" dur="10.11">contracts contracts it is not getting</text>
  <text start="409.629" dur="10.8">any better this economy cannot survive</text>
  <text start="415.989" dur="9">on service if we do not have</text>
  <text start="420.429" dur="7.41">manufacturing this economy will die and</text>
  <text start="424.989" dur="6">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now even</text>
  <text start="427.839" dur="3.271">if our manufacturing is only 10 12 15 %</text>
  <text start="430.989" dur="2.691">of</text>
  <text start="431.11" dur="9.05">the economy we cannot survive on a</text>
  <text start="433.68" dur="10.8">service type economy it doesn&amp;#39;t work and</text>
  <text start="440.16" dur="8.89">this economy will come crashing down and</text>
  <text start="444.48" dur="5.77">we know that the oil market is being</text>
  <text start="449.05" dur="4.29">suppressed they&amp;#39;re putting a lot of</text>
  <text start="450.25" dur="5.52">pressure on Russia trying to destroy the</text>
  <text start="453.34" dur="4.35">economy there we know the oil is being</text>
  <text start="455.77" dur="4.26">suppressed to try to boost the economy</text>
  <text start="457.69" dur="4.98">in the United States by giving more</text>
  <text start="460.03" dur="4.74">people currency in their pockets</text>
  <text start="462.67" dur="3.75">allowing corporations to show that they</text>
  <text start="464.77" dur="6.21">have profits because they have less cost</text>
  <text start="466.42" dur="9.17">in fuel in jet fuel which allows them to</text>
  <text start="470.98" dur="7.47">keep a lot of their sales that they make</text>
  <text start="475.59" dur="6.72">but in the end this is not going to be</text>
  <text start="478.45" dur="7.11">enough because it&amp;#39;s unraveling faster</text>
  <text start="482.31" dur="6.88">than what they can do here and their</text>
  <text start="485.56" dur="6.9">manipulation right now it&amp;#39;s just not</text>
  <text start="489.19" dur="6">working it&amp;#39;s two separate things you</text>
  <text start="492.46" dur="4.95">have their manipulated numbers GDP</text>
  <text start="495.19" dur="5.73">unemployment inflation and so forth and</text>
  <text start="497.41" dur="5.1">then you have the real economy I mean</text>
  <text start="500.92" dur="4.32">just like we said the holiday season was</text>
  <text start="502.51" dur="5.4">a complete bust the banks have been</text>
  <text start="505.24" dur="5.97">speculating in the oil industry and</text>
  <text start="507.91" dur="6">we&amp;#39;re starting to see these large shell</text>
  <text start="511.21" dur="5.16">companies they&amp;#39;re starting to go</text>
  <text start="513.91" dur="5.12">bankrupt they&amp;#39;re filing chapter 11</text>
  <text start="516.37" dur="5.52">Sandridge is on the verge of bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="519.03" dur="4.87">this is going to have a domino effect</text>
  <text start="521.89" dur="3.03">back to the banks because they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="523.9" dur="3.45">going to be able to pay their loans</text>
  <text start="524.92" dur="5.37">these billions and billions of dollars</text>
  <text start="527.35" dur="6.63">worth of loans they&amp;#39;re gonna come due</text>
  <text start="530.29" dur="8.16">and the banks will not be able to</text>
  <text start="533.98" dur="7.14">collect from them this whole thing is a</text>
  <text start="538.45" dur="5.64">disaster basically what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="541.12" dur="8.7">right now and China and Russia realized</text>
  <text start="544.09" dur="9">this the u.s. is going bankrupt Bill</text>
  <text start="549.82" dur="7.02">halter said it best what we are seeing</text>
  <text start="553.09" dur="7.34">right now is centered on the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="556.84" dur="6.24">I mean will it survive or be replaced</text>
  <text start="560.43" dur="4.36">bill holder is saying it&amp;#39;s no longer an</text>
  <text start="563.08" dur="5.97">if but when</text>
  <text start="564.79" dur="7.95">and by what will it be replaced with so</text>
  <text start="569.05" dur="6.5">what are we seeing right now over the</text>
  <text start="572.74" dur="6.27">last two weeks we have seen three very</text>
  <text start="575.55" dur="6.13">important yet interrelated events first</text>
  <text start="579.01" dur="6.09">the sanctions against Iran in place for</text>
  <text start="581.68" dur="4.83">over 35 years have been lifted along</text>
  <text start="585.1" dur="3.78">with this comes the ability for Iran to</text>
  <text start="586.51" dur="5.07">sell oil and they will know how they</text>
  <text start="588.88" dur="6.06">will now have the access of up to 150</text>
  <text start="591.58" dur="6.81">billion worth of assets that were frozen</text>
  <text start="594.94" dur="6.27">remember this money the billions of</text>
  <text start="598.39" dur="5.37">dollars is not something that the US is</text>
  <text start="601.21" dur="7.35">just giving them this was their money</text>
  <text start="603.76" dur="8.07">which was kept in an account when they</text>
  <text start="608.56" dur="7.23">placed sanctions on Iran so they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="611.83" dur="6.87">giving them back their funds they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="615.79" dur="3.99">creating more funds to give them well</text>
  <text start="618.7" dur="3.18">they might have to move a might have</text>
  <text start="619.78" dur="5.16">spent it but it is their money from the</text>
  <text start="621.88" dur="6.21">beginning just a couple days ago</text>
  <text start="624.94" dur="5.73">president Z of China met with Iranian</text>
  <text start="628.09" dur="4.95">leaders one day and then Saudis the</text>
  <text start="630.67" dur="3.9">following day do we know what was said</text>
  <text start="633.04" dur="4.77">in these meetings but we can speculate</text>
  <text start="634.57" dur="4.83">on what happened there most likely it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="637.81" dur="4.59">about oil</text>
  <text start="639.4" dur="7.98">it&amp;#39;s about supplies and who&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="642.4" dur="6.45">supply China and we know that China most</text>
  <text start="647.38" dur="4.23">likely is not gonna want to use the</text>
  <text start="648.85" dur="4.59">dollar when they pay for this oil most</text>
  <text start="651.61" dur="5.43">likely they&amp;#39;re gonna want to use their</text>
  <text start="653.44" dur="6.99">own currency and I&amp;#39;m sure China is</text>
  <text start="657.04" dur="6.48">making a deal with Iran and when they do</text>
  <text start="660.43" dur="5.43">make this deal guess what the United</text>
  <text start="663.52" dur="6.08">States is not going to be happy because</text>
  <text start="665.86" dur="6.27">they want the oil sold in the dollar</text>
  <text start="669.6" dur="6.7">this is what the this is what keeps the</text>
  <text start="672.13" dur="6.81">petrodollar system up and running this</text>
  <text start="676.3" dur="3.47">is what keeps the US economy up and</text>
  <text start="678.94" dur="4.38">running</text>
  <text start="679.77" dur="7.87">Russia and China they know full well</text>
  <text start="683.32" dur="7.11">what is happening here in the US they</text>
  <text start="687.64" dur="6.84">know the u.s. is going to go bankrupt</text>
  <text start="690.43" dur="7.43">it&amp;#39;s going to crash and this is why</text>
  <text start="694.48" dur="8.77">they&amp;#39;ve been duplicating everything out</text>
  <text start="697.86" dur="9.6">in the East they realize the Wes system</text>
  <text start="703.25" dur="10.24">the swift system the dollar as a reserve</text>
  <text start="707.46" dur="8.25">currency all the trading systems are all</text>
  <text start="713.49" dur="9.45">going to be shifted from the United</text>
  <text start="715.71" dur="10.14">States over to China and everything is</text>
  <text start="722.94" dur="5.46">being duplicated they have the Shanghai</text>
  <text start="725.85" dur="4.26">Composite they&amp;#39;re gonna have their own</text>
  <text start="728.4" dur="3.81">trading system that making bilateral</text>
  <text start="730.11" dur="5.34">trade deals all across the globe they</text>
  <text start="732.21" dur="5.04">have clearing houses every country is</text>
  <text start="735.45" dur="5.94">getting in on this except for the United</text>
  <text start="737.25" dur="8.48">States and we can see at this point in</text>
  <text start="741.39" dur="9.21">time that this whole system is</text>
  <text start="745.73" dur="8.25">accelerating in a collapse situation out</text>
  <text start="750.6" dur="8.84">in Puerto Rico this is a good example</text>
  <text start="753.98" dur="9.19">they are defaulting on their creditors</text>
  <text start="759.44" dur="5.8">they&amp;#39;re collapsing and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="763.17" dur="4.98">right now they might have blackouts in</text>
  <text start="765.24" dur="6.35">Puerto Rico because the largest-ever</text>
  <text start="768.15" dur="6.81">muni restructuring has fallen apart and</text>
  <text start="771.59" dur="7.18">the power authority box at a nine</text>
  <text start="774.96" dur="7.41">billion deal so people might not be</text>
  <text start="778.77" dur="5.25">getting their power in Puerto Rico we</text>
  <text start="782.37" dur="3.87">know the central bankers are private</text>
  <text start="784.02" dur="4.11">western central bankers and this is also</text>

  <text start="895.01" dur="6.36">that it&amp;#39;s coming from the House of Saud</text>
  <text start="897.44" dur="10.05">and they might be instrumental in this</text>
  <text start="901.37" dur="10.89">global crash of the economy because we</text>

  <text start="987.769" dur="5.22">they thought they&amp;#39;d be able to keep this</text>
  <text start="989.839" dur="5.34">economy chugging along by capturing</text>

  <text start="1033.659" dur="8.88">how do they explain this they can&amp;#39;t this</text>
  <text start="1039.01" dur="6.6">is why they decided at the point the Fed</text>
  <text start="1042.539" dur="6.311">increased the Fed fund rate this was the</text>
  <text start="1045.61" dur="5.76">signal it&amp;#39;s time to bring down the</text>
