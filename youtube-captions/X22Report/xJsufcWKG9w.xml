  <text start="188.67" dur="4.87">especially here in the United States</text>
  <text start="191.22" dur="5.32">this is why they&amp;#39;ve been demonizing it</text>
  <text start="193.54" dur="5.12">for a little so long and we can see that</text>
  <text start="196.54" dur="5.699">their system is coming to an end and</text>
  <text start="198.66" dur="8.28">this is what they&amp;#39;re worried about we</text>
  <text start="202.239" dur="9.631">see out in Greece right now that the IMF</text>
  <text start="206.94" dur="8.379">the eurozone the looking at Greece</text>
  <text start="211.87" dur="5.82">saying listen we cannot give you any</text>
  <text start="215.319" dur="5.071">more debt actually agree should be</text>
  <text start="217.69" dur="5.76">saying thank you we don&amp;#39;t want any more</text>
  <text start="220.39" dur="5.34">debt because right now the country is at</text>
  <text start="223.45" dur="7.65">a hundred and seventy-six percent of GDP</text>
  <text start="225.73" dur="9.72">and that&amp;#39;s a lot of debt and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="231.1" dur="7.68">seeing right now is that the young well</text>
  <text start="235.45" dur="7.53">they&amp;#39;re very angry every two days around</text>
  <text start="238.78" dur="7.289">15 to 200 kids they launched attacks</text>

  <text start="248.43" dur="8.89">there are a lot of people out of work</text>
  <text start="251.889" dur="8.19">and we can see right now the EU they are</text>
  <text start="257.32" dur="5.819">demanding Athens that they push plans to</text>
  <text start="260.079" dur="6.871">set up new privatization funds sell the</text>
  <text start="263.139" dur="6.84">state assets reform its civil service</text>
  <text start="266.95" dur="7.38">more austerity more austerity and then</text>
  <text start="269.979" dur="6.181">we will give you more debts and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="274.33" dur="3.8">have to see how this plays out because</text>
  <text start="276.16" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;re getting to the situation where</text>
  <text start="278.13" dur="5.71">Europe is deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="281.2" dur="4.92">quickly and here&amp;#39;s an indicator that</text>
  <text start="283.84" dur="4.139">tells us that Europe is completely</text>
  <text start="286.12" dur="6.78">falling apart the Italian finance</text>
  <text start="287.979" dur="8.951">minister he wants the Eurogroup to</text>
  <text start="292.9" dur="6.7">create an unemployment fund</text>
  <text start="296.93" dur="4.23">now Italy is running an unemployment</text>
  <text start="299.6" dur="3.629">rate of about eleven point four percent</text>
  <text start="301.16" dur="4.62">this is the fifth largest in the</text>
  <text start="303.229" dur="7.47">eurozone and Italy wants everyone to</text>
  <text start="305.78" dur="6.96">kick in about 0.5% of GDP to help</text>
  <text start="310.699" dur="6.261">eurozone countries that face economic</text>
  <text start="312.74" dur="7.04">shocks that would impact employment I</text>
  <text start="316.96" dur="6.76">thought the eurozone was doing so well</text>
  <text start="319.78" dur="7.63">eurozone is not doing well the eurozone</text>
  <text start="323.72" dur="6.18">is deteriorating the eurozone</text>
  <text start="327.41" dur="5.46">unemployment rate continually moves</text>
  <text start="329.9" dur="5.93">higher and higher and we can see that</text>
  <text start="332.87" dur="4.859">countries are looking for assistance</text>
  <text start="335.83" dur="4.54">because they know what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="337.729" dur="5.31">when the system is shocked more and more</text>
  <text start="340.37" dur="4.019">people are going to be unemployed we see</text>
  <text start="343.039" dur="3.391">this here in the United States we see it</text>
  <text start="344.389" dur="5.161">in Canada we see it throughout Europe</text>
  <text start="346.43" dur="5.459">and they know what happens when people</text>
  <text start="349.55" dur="5.31">aren&amp;#39;t working people get upset people</text>
  <text start="351.889" dur="7.081">become angry people riot they protest</text>
  <text start="354.86" dur="6.66">and we see right now that the situation</text>
  <text start="358.97" dur="5.61">in Europe is getting worse I mean think</text>
  <text start="361.52" dur="5.55">about this for a second it&amp;#39;s been 16</text>
  <text start="364.58" dur="6.92">months since the European Central Bank</text>
  <text start="367.07" dur="11.04">has now purchased over one trillion in</text>
  <text start="371.5" dur="9.97">government bonds since QE began and when</text>
  <text start="378.11" dur="6.36">we look at this and we see what the ECB</text>
  <text start="381.47" dur="6.15">is doing its supposed to help the</text>
  <text start="384.47" dur="7.41">situation but what&amp;#39;s been happening here</text>
  <text start="387.62" dur="7.13">it&amp;#39;s done nothing manufacturing new</text>
  <text start="391.88" dur="4.98">orders are continually declining</text>
  <text start="394.75" dur="7.449">meanwhile the ECB balance sheet</text>
  <text start="396.86" dur="11.76">continually increases the eu27 teen gdp</text>
  <text start="402.199" dur="9.141">growth continually declines as the ECB</text>
  <text start="408.62" dur="7.639">balance sheet continually increases</text>
  <text start="411.34" dur="9.72">right now the GDP expectation in the EU</text>
  <text start="416.259" dur="9.28">it&amp;#39;s around 1.2 percent it is</text>
  <text start="421.06" dur="6.76">continually dropping so whatever the ECB</text>
  <text start="425.539" dur="5.171">is doing whatever the Fed is doing</text>
  <text start="427.82" dur="5.61">whatever the Bank of Japan is doing</text>
  <text start="430.71" dur="6.15">it is not helping the overall economy</text>
  <text start="433.43" dur="5.71">it&amp;#39;s helping their system their banks</text>
  <text start="436.86" dur="6.89">the elite the one-percent the central</text>
  <text start="439.14" dur="8.4">bankers it is helping those individuals</text>
  <text start="443.75" dur="5.68">everyone else is sitting here going the</text>
  <text start="447.54" dur="5.73">situation on the ground it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="449.43" dur="6.81">worse it is not getting better here in</text>
  <text start="453.27" dur="6.54">the United States we see the ITT</text>
  <text start="456.24" dur="6.38">education services which has been in</text>
  <text start="459.81" dur="7.2">business around 50 years right now well</text>
  <text start="462.62" dur="6.46">they&amp;#39;re shutting down 40,000 students</text>
  <text start="467.01" dur="5.13">are going to be in limbo 8,000 employees</text>
  <text start="469.08" dur="4.56">are going to be fired and the company</text>
  <text start="472.14" dur="3.75">said the closure is due to an</text>
  <text start="473.64" dur="6.93">investigation and sanctions by the US</text>
  <text start="475.89" dur="6.96">Department of Education so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="480.57" dur="5.94">seeing right now is there are more and</text>
  <text start="482.85" dur="6.45">more individuals out of work and all</text>
  <text start="486.51" dur="5.31">these students what are they going to do</text>
  <text start="489.3" dur="7.05">at this point and of course you know</text>
  <text start="491.82" dur="7.05">they have student loans this company has</text>
  <text start="496.35" dur="5.27">been the subject of a state and federal</text>
  <text start="498.87" dur="5.52">probe for various reasons including its</text>
  <text start="501.62" dur="7.72">recruitment tactics lending practices</text>
  <text start="504.39" dur="7.35">and job placement figures now this is</text>
  <text start="509.34" dur="7.62">the second time we&amp;#39;ve heard that a</text>
  <text start="511.74" dur="8.57">college is kind of falsifying job</text>
  <text start="516.96" dur="5.85">placement figures why would that pay I</text>
  <text start="520.31" dur="3.52">think it was the Corinthian college that</text>
  <text start="522.81" dur="3.9">was doing this before where they were</text>
  <text start="523.83" dur="5.01">sued because what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="526.71" dur="3.69">more and more people are taking out</text>
  <text start="528.84" dur="3.99">student loans to go into these schools</text>
  <text start="530.4" dur="5.16">and they&amp;#39;re saying can I get a job if I</text>
  <text start="532.83" dur="4.44">do this and they say yes of course you</text>
  <text start="535.56" dur="4.5">can get a job here or here or here and</text>
  <text start="537.27" dur="6.27">this is what you&amp;#39;ll be making but in</text>
  <text start="540.06" dur="9.12">reality these jobs don&amp;#39;t exist in</text>
  <text start="543.54" dur="8.94">reality they need to fake it to get more</text>
  <text start="549.18" dur="4.53">and more individuals enrolled because</text>
  <text start="552.48" dur="2.52">they know people aren&amp;#39;t going to be</text>
  <text start="553.71" dur="3.41">taking the money out of their own pocket</text>
  <text start="555" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re gonna be taking loans out and</text>
  <text start="557.12" dur="4.45">they have to show people that after you</text>
  <text start="559.44" dur="4.71">take these loans out you&amp;#39;re going to get</text>
  <text start="561.57" dur="7.41">a job but we see the opposite</text>
  <text start="564.15" dur="7.38">happening once again it is so bad here</text>
  <text start="568.98" dur="5.75">in the United States that right now</text>
  <text start="571.53" dur="6.63">government employees now outnumber</text>
  <text start="574.73" dur="8.95">manufacturing employees by almost 100</text>
  <text start="578.16" dur="8.27">million with a ratio of 1.8 government</text>
  <text start="583.68" dur="6.2">workers to every manufacturing worker</text>
  <text start="586.43" dur="7.21">well that seems like an incredible</text>
  <text start="589.88" dur="6.75">economic model that&amp;#39;s going to grow and</text>
  <text start="593.64" dur="5.52">grow and grow and improve no it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="596.63" dur="4.36">the reason why they needed to add all</text>
  <text start="599.16" dur="4.65">these government jobs is because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="600.99" dur="4.86">losing them in manufacturing most of the</text>
  <text start="603.81" dur="5.51">people who&amp;#39;ve lost their jobs in</text>
  <text start="605.85" dur="7.92">manufacturing had to get jobs in</text>
  <text start="609.32" dur="8.29">hospitality in leisure and this is</text>
  <text start="613.77" dur="5.97">exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="617.61" dur="3.99">that those people who were working in</text>
  <text start="619.74" dur="4.01">manufacturing they&amp;#39;re getting lower</text>
  <text start="621.6" dur="4.53">paying leisure and hospitality jobs</text>
  <text start="623.75" dur="5.47">because those those jobs right now</text>
  <text start="626.13" dur="7.28">outnumber manufacturing jobs so we have</text>
  <text start="629.22" dur="9.66">government jobs leisure hospitality all</text>
  <text start="633.41" dur="8.14">outnumbering manufacturing jobs the</text>
  <text start="638.88" dur="8.16">situation is not improving it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="641.55" dur="7.71">getting worse and as time goes on it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="647.04" dur="5.76">going to get worse and worse we see</text>
  <text start="649.26" dur="7.71">these services economy well they have</text>

  <text start="685.17" dur="8.01">month of the last eight the feds labor</text>
  <text start="688.65" dur="7.66">market indicator has dropped telling us</text>
  <text start="693.18" dur="6.25">that this system is Drew</text>

  <text start="729.58" dur="4.56">about it yes they can continually prop</text>
  <text start="732.13" dur="4.29">it up but eventually what happens is</text>
  <text start="734.14" dur="4.56">that other countries realize what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="736.42" dur="4.91">happening and other countries pull away</text>
  <text start="738.7" dur="4.8">which we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and</text>
