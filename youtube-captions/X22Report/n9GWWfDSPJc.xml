  <text start="41" dur="4.9">2019 and the thought of the episode is</text>
  <text start="43.26" dur="3.51">Trump&amp;#39;s plan for the economy is bigger</text>
  <text start="45.9" dur="3.479">than we thought</text>
  <text start="46.77" dur="4.53">did he outsmart the central bank now</text>
  <text start="49.379" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t you just love it when you find a</text>
  <text start="51.3" dur="4.65">$20 bill in a jacket pocket you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="53.489" dur="4.231">worn in ages or a purse you&amp;#39;ve not used</text>
  <text start="55.95" dur="3.57">for a long time well imagine this</text>
  <text start="57.72" dur="3.089">finding hundreds of dollars in the</text>
  <text start="59.52" dur="1.77">papers that are sitting in your filing</text>
  <text start="60.809" dur="2.281">cabinet</text>
  <text start="61.29" dur="3.39">I&amp;#39;m talking about that old 401k</text>
  <text start="63.09" dur="2.249">paperwork that money is sitting there</text>
  <text start="64.68" dur="2.579">doing nothing</text>
  <text start="65.339" dur="3.871">our friends are normal gold in Cass and</text>
  <text start="67.259" dur="4.051">I over that loss paperwork and see if</text>
  <text start="69.21" dur="4.019">you qualify for a precious metals IRA</text>

  <text start="73.229" dur="5.941">special Morgan Silver Dollars for all</text>
  <text start="75.479" dur="5.521">qualified IRAs above $20,000 so dig out</text>
  <text start="79.17" dur="4.88">the old paperwork and click the link</text>
  <text start="81" dur="5.399">below to get started on your gold IRA</text>
  <text start="84.05" dur="4.87">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="86.399" dur="6.5">financial news now we know that Trump</text>
  <text start="88.92" dur="7.649">and the Patriots they are planning to</text>
  <text start="92.899" dur="7">completely reset this economy and we</text>
  <text start="96.569" dur="5.22">know that Q is told us that gold is</text>
  <text start="99.899" dur="3.571">going to bring down the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="101.789" dur="5.041">and there&amp;#39;s going to be a restructuring</text>
  <text start="103.47" dur="7.86">but I think this economic plan is much</text>
  <text start="106.83" dur="6.75">much larger than we all think and just</text>
  <text start="111.33" dur="5.459">the other day Trump mentioned that he</text>
  <text start="113.58" dur="7.56">wants the entire nation to be built on a</text>
  <text start="116.789" dur="6.151">5 g or 6 g system now a lot of people</text>
  <text start="121.14" dur="3.06">think themselves why would he come out</text>
  <text start="122.94" dur="3.599">and say this while we have to compete</text>
  <text start="124.2" dur="5.04">with China because we need to have our</text>
  <text start="126.539" dur="7.891">apps load faster on the phones we need</text>
  <text start="129.24" dur="8.82">our calls to be crystal clear no yes</text>
  <text start="134.43" dur="6.68">those are some reasons why you would</text>
  <text start="138.06" dur="6.3">want it but do we really need apps</text>
  <text start="141.11" dur="7.48">working a lot faster today do we need</text>
  <text start="144.36" dur="10.14">the video streaming a lot faster what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="148.59" dur="8.729">the other reason why he wants 5 G or 6 G</text>
  <text start="154.5" dur="5.34">and why does he want all companies on</text>
  <text start="157.319" dur="5.491">board we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking about that</text>
  <text start="159.84" dur="4.64">in just a moment but first I want to</text>
  <text start="162.81" dur="4.34">head out to France right now</text>
  <text start="164.48" dur="4.92">because it looks like the elite they are</text>
  <text start="167.15" dur="4.47">panicking like we&amp;#39;ve never seen them</text>
  <text start="169.4" dur="5.04">panic before now we know the brexit is</text>
  <text start="171.62" dur="5.339">going on in the UK we know there&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="174.44" dur="4.59">no deal whatsoever we know the EU is</text>
  <text start="176.959" dur="5.041">saying listen either you accept what we</text>
  <text start="179.03" dur="5.069">have or we can&amp;#39;t accept anything else</text>
  <text start="182" dur="5.91">and I do believe the central bankers</text>
  <text start="184.099" dur="6.181">plan is to keep the UK in limbo and I</text>
  <text start="187.91" dur="5.549">think the people of the UK should</text>
  <text start="190.28" dur="6.269">separate with a No Deal plan just</text>
  <text start="193.459" dur="10.011">breakaway but we have Makran out there</text>
  <text start="196.549" dur="11.671">and he went out of his way to say listen</text>
  <text start="203.47" dur="8.41">we should not abandon the European Union</text>
  <text start="208.22" dur="7.23">we should abandon the brexit we should</text>
  <text start="211.88" dur="6.06">cancel the brexit now he&amp;#39;s making a plea</text>
  <text start="215.45" dur="4.74">to all the voters he&amp;#39;s talking to all</text>
  <text start="217.94" dur="4.53">the countries throughout Europe saying</text>
  <text start="220.19" dur="4.799">listen we all need to band together and</text>
  <text start="222.47" dur="4.65">we need to back and enhance European</text>
  <text start="224.989" dur="6.511">Union you know that entity that is not</text>
  <text start="227.12" dur="7.019">elected the entity that controls elected</text>
  <text start="231.5" dur="4.109">governments and the people he said we</text>
  <text start="234.139" dur="4.231">cannot let nationalist</text>
  <text start="235.609" dur="5.431">without solutions exploit the people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="238.37" dur="7.17">anger we cannot sleep walk through a</text>
  <text start="241.04" dur="8.49">diminished Europe he&amp;#39;s saying that the</text>
  <text start="245.54" dur="6.33">brexit vote was a symbol of a European</text>
  <text start="249.53" dur="6.69">trap which he claimed was caused by lies</text>
  <text start="251.87" dur="7.169">and irresponsibility he is panicking</text>
  <text start="256.22" dur="5.549">right now because they see the writing</text>
  <text start="259.039" dur="5.221">on the wall they see everything that</text>
  <text start="261.769" dur="4.831">they were pushing for is falling apart</text>
  <text start="264.26" dur="4.29">and the people are saying you know</text>
  <text start="266.6" dur="4.439">something we don&amp;#39;t want to be a part of</text>
  <text start="268.55" dur="4.71">this now if the brexit goes through</text>
  <text start="271.039" dur="5.611">which I do believe it will and hopefully</text>
  <text start="273.26" dur="5.85">with a No Deal other nations are going</text>
  <text start="276.65" dur="6.239">to follow this is their biggest fear</text>
  <text start="279.11" dur="5.4">Italy most likely will be next and this</text>
  <text start="282.889" dur="4.431">is what they&amp;#39;re really afraid of</text>
  <text start="284.51" dur="5.73">and right now Makran he&amp;#39;s out there with</text>
  <text start="287.32" dur="5.62">Angela Merkel trying to hold all of this</text>
  <text start="290.24" dur="6.15">together is it going to work I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="292.94" dur="4.84">think so here in the United States we</text>
  <text start="296.39" dur="6.07">can see that the central</text>
  <text start="297.78" dur="7.08">system it is rapidly deteriorating now</text>
  <text start="302.46" dur="5.91">the people they&amp;#39;re the ones who are</text>
  <text start="304.86" dur="5.16">getting hit hard with this and we know</text>
  <text start="308.37" dur="3.81">that a lot of people have part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="310.02" dur="4.2">we know a lot of people are struggling</text>
  <text start="312.18" dur="5.01">right now a lot of people have debt and</text>
  <text start="314.22" dur="5.46">I remember this system was designed to</text>
  <text start="317.19" dur="6.21">make sure that the majority of the</text>
  <text start="319.68" dur="5.9">people are in debt am I saying every</text>
  <text start="323.4" dur="6.69">single person No</text>
  <text start="325.58" dur="8.55">remember it doesn&amp;#39;t affect 100% everyone</text>
  <text start="330.09" dur="7.98">but their system does affect probably</text>
  <text start="334.13" dur="5.68">90% or so of the people here in the</text>
  <text start="338.07" dur="5.22">United States where a lot of these</text>
  <text start="339.81" dur="5.28">people are in debt deep debt and really</text>
  <text start="343.29" dur="4.53">deep deep deep debt and there&amp;#39;s others</text>
  <text start="345.09" dur="3.96">that just can&amp;#39;t get by on what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="347.82" dur="4.05">making so they need government</text>
  <text start="349.05" dur="5.64">assistance this is how the central bank</text>
  <text start="351.87" dur="6.54">system is designed right now us credit</text>
  <text start="354.69" dur="5.58">card debt well it hit 870 billion this</text>
  <text start="358.41" dur="4.319">is the largest amount ever as of</text>
  <text start="360.27" dur="6.66">December 2018 and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="362.729" dur="6.391">the Fed credit card balances rose by 26</text>
  <text start="366.93" dur="3.9">billion from the prior quarter the</text>
  <text start="369.12" dur="4.53">increase in credit card balance is</text>
  <text start="370.83" dur="4.86">consistent with seasonal patterns but</text>
  <text start="373.65" dur="6.23">marks the first time credit card</text>
  <text start="375.69" dur="8.64">balances retouched the 2008 nominal peak</text>
  <text start="379.88" dur="7.21">nearly 480 million credit cards are now</text>
  <text start="384.33" dur="4.86">in circulation up by more than 100</text>
  <text start="387.09" dur="7.199">million since hitting bottom after the</text>
  <text start="389.19" dur="7.86">recession a decade ago about 37 million</text>
  <text start="394.289" dur="4.471">credit card accounts had a 90 plus state</text>
  <text start="397.05" dur="3.989">delinquent mark added to their credit</text>
  <text start="398.76" dur="5.279">report last quarter this is an increase</text>
  <text start="401.039" dur="7.291">of about two million from the fourth</text>
  <text start="404.039" dur="8.581">quarter of 2017 and the question is why</text>
  <text start="408.33" dur="8.459">do people need credit cards why can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="412.62" dur="6.359">people survive on the income that</text>
  <text start="416.789" dur="5.701">they&amp;#39;re making think about it for a</text>
  <text start="418.979" dur="6.271">second because there was a time where</text>
  <text start="422.49" dur="5.28">people didn&amp;#39;t need credit actually there</text>
  <text start="425.25" dur="5.449">was very little bit of credit and people</text>
  <text start="427.77" dur="8.039">had to use their cash</text>
  <text start="430.699" dur="9.131">to survive today people can&amp;#39;t even do</text>
  <text start="435.809" dur="6.9">that they have to use credit and what</text>
  <text start="439.83" dur="5.669">happens is you get into this entire</text>
  <text start="442.709" dur="5.52">credit system that you can really never</text>
  <text start="445.499" dur="5.46">get out of unless you go bankrupt and</text>
  <text start="448.229" dur="5.01">you write all of it off hmm maybe that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="450.959" dur="4.5">what the country is going to do we see</text>
  <text start="453.239" dur="5.13">the Federal Reserve right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="455.459" dur="6.27">beige book is saying that the economy is</text>
  <text start="458.369" dur="5.7">heading into a new normal a slower</text>
  <text start="461.729" dur="4.92">growth that Lika will keep monetary</text>
  <text start="464.069" dur="6">policy restrained this is coming from</text>
  <text start="466.649" dur="5.85">New York Fed Reserve President John</text>
  <text start="470.069" dur="4.05">Williams so what they&amp;#39;re saying right</text>
  <text start="472.499" dur="5.04">now they&amp;#39;re gonna stick with their</text>
  <text start="474.119" dur="6.181">patient approach they&amp;#39;re saying oh you</text>
  <text start="477.539" dur="4.73">know what the economy slowing so maybe</text>
  <text start="480.3" dur="4.729">we shouldn&amp;#39;t raise the rates right now</text>
  <text start="482.269" dur="4.72">maybe we should just hold them steady</text>
  <text start="485.029" dur="3.94">does this mean they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="486.989" dur="5.25">raise the rates no does this mean</text>
  <text start="488.969" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re gonna lower the rates no what</text>
  <text start="492.239" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re saying right now is because of</text>
  <text start="494.429" dur="5.431">the economy where it&amp;#39;s slowing right now</text>
  <text start="496.439" dur="6.03">we can&amp;#39;t do anything now if you look at</text>
  <text start="499.86" dur="5.369">the numbers that Trump continually is</text>
  <text start="502.469" dur="4.8">producing GDP is much higher than it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="505.229" dur="3.02">ever been the stock market is higher</text>
  <text start="507.269" dur="3.24">than it&amp;#39;s ever been</text>
  <text start="508.249" dur="4.78">unemployment is the lowest that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="510.509" dur="5.34">seen in a very long time but during the</text>
  <text start="513.029" dur="6.45">Obama administration they told us that</text>
  <text start="515.849" dur="7.25">everything was growing and Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="519.479" dur="7.41">numbers were worse than Trump&amp;#39;s numbers</text>
  <text start="523.099" dur="7.42">hmm that&amp;#39;s kind of strange do you think</text>
  <text start="526.889" dur="6.661">the Fed is using this as cover to say</text>
  <text start="530.519" dur="5.161">this is the reason why we&amp;#39;re keeping the</text>
  <text start="533.55" dur="3.8">interest rates the way they are instead</text>
  <text start="535.68" dur="4.829">of saying hey Trump told us to do this</text>
  <text start="537.35" dur="4.299">it&amp;#39;s starting to seem that way now in</text>
  <text start="540.509" dur="4.861">the beginning of the report we were</text>
  <text start="541.649" dur="8.401">discussing the five G or six G that</text>
  <text start="545.37" dur="8.909">Trump is proposing and he tweeted out</text>
  <text start="550.05" dur="6.06">the following I want five G and even six</text>
  <text start="554.279" dur="2.43">G technology Unites States as soon as</text>
  <text start="556.11" dur="3.12">possible</text>
  <text start="556.709" dur="4.35">it is far more powerful faster and</text>
  <text start="559.23" dur="4.079">smarter than the current standard</text>
  <text start="561.059" dur="2.821">American companies must step up their</text>
  <text start="563.309" dur="2.97">efforts</text>
  <text start="563.88" dur="4.079">or get left behind there is no reason</text>
  <text start="566.279" dur="4.11">that we should be lagging behind on</text>
  <text start="567.959" dur="4.921">something that is so obviously the</text>
  <text start="570.389" dur="4.771">future I want the United States to win</text>
  <text start="572.88" dur="4.47">through competition not by blocking out</text>
  <text start="575.16" dur="3.989">currently more advanced technology we</text>
  <text start="577.35" dur="3.63">must always be the leader in everything</text>
  <text start="579.149" dur="5.18">we do especially when it comes to the</text>
  <text start="580.98" dur="6.27">very exciting world of technology now</text>
  <text start="584.329" dur="6.7">this is very interesting we know that</text>
  <text start="587.25" dur="6.93">China they have a government control 5g</text>
  <text start="591.029" dur="5.04">network and China has achieved the</text>
  <text start="594.18" dur="4.13">dominant position in the manufacturing</text>
  <text start="596.069" dur="5.221">operation of network infrastructure</text>
  <text start="598.31" dur="6.31">China is the dominant actor in the</text>
  <text start="601.29" dur="5.489">information domain and we can see that</text>
  <text start="604.62" dur="5.07">Trump is calling on all these different</text>
  <text start="606.779" dur="7.23">companies AT&amp;amp;T Verizon t-mobile to make</text>
  <text start="609.69" dur="7.29">the United States v g6g ready now the</text>
  <text start="614.009" dur="6.181">question is is it because it will help</text>
  <text start="616.98" dur="8.4">us with our phones in everyday use with</text>
  <text start="620.19" dur="6.649">video streaming with apps with calls no</text>

  <text start="631.56" dur="7.649">need it for what what is the truth of</text>
  <text start="635.009" dur="7.32">this well it might have to do with the</text>
  <text start="639.209" dur="5.581">economy there&amp;#39;s a report out there</text>
  <text start="642.329" dur="5.401">called blockchain and 5g enabled</text>
  <text start="644.79" dur="6.93">Internet of Things which will redefine</text>
  <text start="647.73" dur="6.029">supply chains and trade finance let me</text>
  <text start="651.72" dur="5.21">just read a portion of this so you get</text>
  <text start="653.759" dur="5.58">an idea of what they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="656.93" dur="4.18">currently the movement of goods and</text>
  <text start="659.339" dur="4.141">commodities across the globe is driven</text>
  <text start="661.11" dur="4.709">by a processes that have remained static</text>
  <text start="663.48" dur="5.49">over many decades and in some cases</text>
  <text start="665.819" dur="6.21">centuries supply chains developed around</text>
  <text start="668.97" dur="6.239">the need to move away from barter driven</text>
  <text start="672.029" dur="6.781">trade to one based on units of accounts</text>
  <text start="675.209" dur="6.18">and stores of value such as gold which</text>
  <text start="678.81" dur="5.009">allowed for the acquisition of goods for</text>
  <text start="681.389" dur="4.771">money these advances led to the rise of</text>
  <text start="683.819" dur="3.991">market places around the world ocean</text>
  <text start="686.16" dur="3.989">shipping made it possible to move large</text>
  <text start="687.81" dur="4.8">quantities of goods and commodities from</text>
  <text start="690.149" dur="4.68">one port to another far more efficiently</text>
  <text start="692.61" dur="4.11">since then many advances in our supply</text>
  <text start="694.829" dur="2.82">chains have focused on addressing</text>
  <text start="696.72" dur="2.94">certain</text>
  <text start="697.649" dur="5.341">mental issues that arise out of</text>
  <text start="699.66" dur="6.109">transactions not involving the exchange</text>
  <text start="702.99" dur="7.11">of board goods or exchanges for money</text>
  <text start="705.769" dur="6.87">the promise of secure real-time data</text>
  <text start="710.1" dur="6">about goods and transit requires</text>
  <text start="712.639" dur="7.841">bandwidth having capacity that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="716.1" dur="7.709">exist with our current infrastructure 5g</text>
  <text start="720.48" dur="5.82">enabled IOT is intended to greatly</text>
  <text start="723.809" dur="4.291">increase this capacity without this</text>
  <text start="726.3" dur="3.569">upgrade to our telecommunication</text>
  <text start="728.1" dur="4.019">infrastructure the development and</text>
  <text start="729.869" dur="4.95">adoption of sub blockchain solutions</text>
  <text start="732.119" dur="5.491">involving logistics will be limited to</text>
  <text start="734.819" dur="4.8">pilots and other deployments of reduced</text>
  <text start="737.61" dur="3.509">scale blockchain technology is</text>
  <text start="739.619" dur="4.981">particularly well suited to respond to</text>
  <text start="741.119" dur="7.2">both challenges and opportunities of 5g</text>
  <text start="744.6" dur="6.089">enabled IOT therefore it is very likely</text>
  <text start="748.319" dur="5.61">that each technology will spill will</text>
  <text start="750.689" dur="5.46">spur greater adoption to the other now</text>
  <text start="753.929" dur="5.491">this whole entire report is talking</text>
  <text start="756.149" dur="6.23">about taking the supply chain taking</text>
  <text start="759.42" dur="7.62">trade taking everything that we know</text>
  <text start="762.379" dur="9.25">currency and putting it on the block</text>
  <text start="767.04" dur="8.519">chain removing it from the Federal</text>
  <text start="771.629" dur="7.5">Reserve System removing it from a</text>
  <text start="775.559" dur="7.89">central bank and one of the reasons why</text>
  <text start="779.129" dur="7.31">this cannot happen today is because we</text>
  <text start="783.449" dur="6.5">do not have five g or six g our</text>
  <text start="786.439" dur="7.301">infrastructure today cannot support this</text>
  <text start="789.949" dur="8.76">so from what I&amp;#39;m seeing here it looks</text>
  <text start="793.74" dur="8.069">like Trump is moving us into the next</text>
  <text start="798.709" dur="6.581">economy the next economy will most</text>
  <text start="801.809" dur="6.89">likely be all blockchain based and this</text>
  <text start="805.29" dur="7.5">is why he&amp;#39;s pushing companies like AT&amp;amp;T</text>
  <text start="808.699" dur="7.3">Verizon t-mobile and many others to</text>
  <text start="812.79" dur="4.95">bring in 5g it&amp;#39;s time to do it other</text>
  <text start="815.999" dur="7.08">countries around the world they already</text>
  <text start="817.74" dur="8.93">have 5g China they&amp;#39;re prepared for the</text>
  <text start="823.079" dur="6.901">next economic revolution and I believe</text>
  <text start="826.67" dur="4.01">this is going to be a blockchain system</text>
  <text start="829.98" dur="4.84">and I believe</text>
  <text start="830.68" dur="6.48">that currency might even run on this</text>
  <text start="834.82" dur="5.01">system and this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the</text>
  <text start="837.16" dur="5.76">blockchain currency won&amp;#39;t be backed by</text>
  <text start="839.83" dur="4.98">something it can be backed by gold it</text>
  <text start="842.92" dur="5.22">can be backed by pretty much anything</text>
  <text start="844.81" dur="5.339">but Q has told us that gold is going to</text>
  <text start="848.14" dur="5.34">bring down the fair reserve didn&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="850.149" dur="5.971">exactly how gold is going to be bringing</text>
  <text start="853.48" dur="6.12">down the Federal Reserve what happens if</text>
  <text start="856.12" dur="5.969">we have a crypto type of currency</text>
  <text start="859.6" dur="4.26">running on the blonk chain system Trump</text>
  <text start="862.089" dur="4.56">gets the United States prepared with</text>
  <text start="863.86" dur="6">five g or six g the infrastructure now</text>
  <text start="866.649" dur="6.661">can handle blockchain they back the</text>
  <text start="869.86" dur="8.94">digital currency with gold why do we</text>
  <text start="873.31" dur="10.08">need the Federal Reserve we don&amp;#39;t can we</text>
  <text start="878.8" dur="6.9">do trade with the blockchain yes can we</text>
  <text start="883.39" dur="4.74">do real estate transactions with the</text>
  <text start="885.7" dur="5.49">blockchain yes actually they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="888.13" dur="7.23">doing this will it make it easier for</text>
  <text start="891.19" dur="8.22">stores to handle blockchain currency</text>
  <text start="895.36" dur="5.52">transactions yes it will because people</text>
  <text start="899.41" dur="4.61">will be able to take their phones and</text>
  <text start="900.88" dur="7.2">then go ahead and pay for something I</text>
  <text start="904.02" dur="9.04">believe what Trump is doing right now is</text>
  <text start="908.08" dur="8.04">he&amp;#39;s preparing the entire country for</text>
  <text start="913.06" dur="4.2">the new economic system bringing us to</text>
  <text start="916.12" dur="3.409">five g6g</text>
  <text start="917.26" dur="4.8">bringing on the blockchain system</text>
  <text start="919.529" dur="4.271">removing us from the central bank and I</text>
  <text start="922.06" dur="3.96">don&amp;#39;t think the United States is going</text>
  <text start="923.8" dur="4.26">to be the only country I believe that</text>
  <text start="926.02" dur="4.61">this is going to be other countries they</text>
  <text start="928.06" dur="7.38">already have their infrastructure set up</text>
  <text start="930.63" dur="7.899">think about it if every country and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="935.44" dur="8.339">not saying 100% but the main countries</text>
  <text start="938.529" dur="10.55">all pull away Russia China the United</text>
  <text start="943.779" dur="11.831">States North Korea South Korea Vietnam</text>
  <text start="949.079" dur="11.901">India and many others if we all switch</text>
  <text start="955.61" dur="8.34">- a blockchain system move away from the</text>
  <text start="960.98" dur="8.01">central bank back the currency our</text>
  <text start="963.95" dur="9.03">tokenized with gold guess what the</text>
  <text start="968.99" dur="6.9">central bank is finished the central</text>
  <text start="972.98" dur="6.6">bank would be in trouble because</text>
  <text start="975.89" dur="5.7">countries decided to move away and it</text>
  <text start="979.58" dur="6.11">wouldn&amp;#39;t be that hard of a move because</text>
  <text start="981.59" dur="7.29">we&amp;#39;re using electronic currency today</text>
  <text start="985.69" dur="7.72">transactions would be pretty much almost</text>
  <text start="988.88" dur="8.04">the same except the only difference is</text>
  <text start="993.41" dur="7.74">we don&amp;#39;t have a centralized bank which</text>
  <text start="996.92" dur="8.07">is a private bank taking care of our</text>
  <text start="1001.15" dur="7.44">currency so it looks like Trump&amp;#39;s plan</text>
  <text start="1004.99" dur="4.17">the Patriots plan is much larger than we</text>
