  <text start="167.93" dur="8.4">industry it is completely amazing what</text>
  <text start="172.67" dur="7.11">these banks get away with and Deutsche</text>

  <text start="179.78" dur="8.19">earnings they&amp;#39;re going to drop sharply</text>
  <text start="184.99" dur="5.53">we&amp;#39;re getting warnings from other</text>
  <text start="187.97" dur="6.44">financial institutions saying that we</text>
  <text start="190.52" dur="6.66">are most likely in a recession now but</text>
  <text start="194.41" dur="4.27">we know the US government central</text>
  <text start="197.18" dur="5.49">bankers they&amp;#39;re not going to admit to</text>
  <text start="198.68" dur="8.76">that now we understand that the US</text>
  <text start="202.67" dur="9.15">government central bankers their agenda</text>
  <text start="207.44" dur="7.23">is to control the world with the one</text>
  <text start="211.82" dur="4.2">world government they&amp;#39;re finding that to</text>
  <text start="214.67" dur="2.88">be a little difficult because the</text>
  <text start="216.02" dur="6.33">government&amp;#39;s of course will not give up</text>
  <text start="217.55" dur="7.74">power they can be swayed they could be</text>
  <text start="222.35" dur="6.51">bribed but they don&amp;#39;t have complete</text>
  <text start="225.29" dur="7.29">control so they need to create something</text>
  <text start="228.86" dur="6.27">completely different where governments</text>
  <text start="232.58" dur="4.71">believe they&amp;#39;re in control and we</text>
  <text start="235.13" dur="3.18">discuss this before it&amp;#39;s called the isds</text>
  <text start="237.29" dur="3.32">it&amp;#39;s the investor state dispute</text>
  <text start="238.31" dur="6.93">settlement and it was supposed to be</text>
  <text start="240.61" dur="7.15">expanded with the TPP but we can see</text>
  <text start="245.24" dur="6.3">right now the TPP might have problems</text>
  <text start="247.76" dur="5.66">and of course Obama is waiting for after</text>
  <text start="251.54" dur="5.73">the elections in the lame duck session</text>
  <text start="253.42" dur="6.45">hoping to push this through without</text>
  <text start="257.27" dur="5.34">anyone looking maybe bribe a couple</text>
  <text start="259.87" dur="4.81">congressman get it through because they</text>
  <text start="262.61" dur="4.29">really don&amp;#39;t care at this point but we</text>
  <text start="264.68" dur="5.39">can see right now this is the plane but</text>
  <text start="266.9" dur="5.67">if they cannot get the ttp through or</text>
  <text start="270.07" dur="4.12">throughout Europe the TTIP if that</text>
  <text start="272.57" dur="3.66">doesn&amp;#39;t go through and we can see where</text>
  <text start="274.19" dur="5.04">there&amp;#39;s many many problems out in</text>
  <text start="276.23" dur="5.61">Germany out in France and many other of</text>
  <text start="279.23" dur="6.63">the European countries are saying no way</text>
  <text start="281.84" dur="9.99">to this deal we see they have a back-up</text>
  <text start="285.86" dur="8.01">plan and this back-up plan is the</text>
  <text start="291.83" dur="6.769">comprehensive economic and trade</text>
  <text start="293.87" dur="8.999">agreement seta now this is coming out of</text>
  <text start="298.599" dur="6.97">european union and canada the agreement</text>
  <text start="302.869" dur="4.83">allows any corporation that operates</text>
  <text start="305.569" dur="4.53">there regardless of where it has its</text>
  <text start="307.699" dur="4.77">headquarters to sue governments before</text>
  <text start="310.099" dur="4.35">in an international tribunal it</text>
  <text start="312.469" dur="6.48">threatens to tear apart the laws that</text>
  <text start="314.449" dur="6.87">protect us from exploitation and it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="318.949" dur="4.77">obstacle to the passing of laws on both</text>
  <text start="321.319" dur="8.1">sides of the Atlantic and we already</text>
  <text start="323.719" dur="8.641">know that system is the isds and what</text>
  <text start="329.419" dur="6.6">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that Europe</text>
  <text start="332.36" dur="10.229">and Canada they&amp;#39;re almost ready to pass</text>
  <text start="336.019" dur="8.281">this I mean this trade agreement which</text>
  <text start="342.589" dur="6.12">is it&amp;#39;s really not a trade agreement is</text>
  <text start="344.3" dur="8.569">around sixteen hundred pages long and it</text>
  <text start="348.709" dur="7.88">was kept a secret just like the TTIP and</text>
  <text start="352.869" dur="7.741">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="356.589" dur="8.55">agreement seta threatens to cement</text>
  <text start="360.61" dur="7.179">privatization by making impossible the</text>
  <text start="365.139" dur="4.57">realization or the attempts by cities to</text>
  <text start="367.789" dur="4.89">take control of declining public</text>
  <text start="369.709" dur="5.7">services now seta will allow</text>
  <text start="372.679" dur="4.2">corporations to sue governments when</text>
  <text start="375.409" dur="4.65">they consider their expected future</text>
  <text start="376.879" dur="6.33">profits are threatened by any new laws</text>
  <text start="380.059" dur="5.45">that those governments come up with said</text>
  <text start="383.209" dur="4.5">to also places restrictions on the</text>
  <text start="385.509" dur="5.65">methods by which governments can protect</text>
  <text start="387.709" dur="5.07">their people it seems to prohibit for</text>
  <text start="391.159" dur="3.48">example the adoption of rules that would</text>
  <text start="392.779" dur="5.07">prevent Bangz from expanding into the</text>
  <text start="394.639" dur="5.04">state of too big to fail it seems to</text>
  <text start="397.849" dur="4.02">threaten our planning laws and other</text>
  <text start="399.679" dur="5.28">protective measures based on common</text>
  <text start="401.869" dur="5.91">sense and of course set the claims that</text>
  <text start="404.959" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s a trade agreement but we can see</text>
  <text start="407.779" dur="7.711">many of its provisions have really</text>
  <text start="410.389" dur="8.221">nothing to do with trade at all some</text>
  <text start="415.49" dur="8.489">Bulgarian MPs they&amp;#39;re worried about seta</text>
  <text start="418.61" dur="9.989">but this is their back-up plan this is</text>
  <text start="423.979" dur="6.81">the plan if they cannot get TTIP and we</text>
  <text start="428.599" dur="3.391">can see right now the US government</text>
  <text start="430.789" dur="5.311">central bankers in central</text>
  <text start="431.99" dur="7.59">around the world corporations they want</text>
  <text start="436.1" dur="5.67">this not for the people not for the good</text>
  <text start="439.58" dur="5.73">of the people they want this for</text>
  <text start="441.77" dur="6.29">themselves they want total control and</text>
  <text start="445.31" dur="7.68">what way to do this is to be above</text>
  <text start="448.06" dur="8.13">governments to control governments to</text>
  <text start="452.99" dur="5.85">rule above the laws of government and</text>
  <text start="456.19" dur="9.01">this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing right</text>
  <text start="458.84" dur="12.62">now and if we allow this to happen if we</text>
  <text start="465.2" dur="9.35">allow these trade agreements to get past</text>
  <text start="471.46" dur="5.44">it&amp;#39;s going to be horrific for the people</text>
  <text start="474.55" dur="5.23">it&amp;#39;s going to be awful for certain</text>
  <text start="476.9" dur="7.08">countries because what&amp;#39;s written in</text>
  <text start="479.78" dur="7.41">these things does not benefit anyone</text>
  <text start="483.98" dur="6.84">except the elite essential bakers the</text>
  <text start="487.19" dur="8.55">corporations and we can see they really</text>
  <text start="490.82" dur="9.99">want these past because if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="495.74" dur="8.4">get these past and governments wake up</text>
  <text start="500.81" dur="5.96">and the people wake up they will have</text>
  <text start="504.14" dur="6.42">the ability to go after the</text>
  <text start="506.77" dur="6.85">corporation&amp;#39;s the central bank&amp;#39;s they</text>
  <text start="510.56" dur="6.87">won&amp;#39;t have to go the two there is d</text>
  <text start="513.62" dur="5.55">escorts governments will say no we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="517.43" dur="5.73">going to pass a law and you have to</text>
  <text start="519.17" dur="8.61">abide by it now this is just going to</text>
  <text start="523.16" dur="9.32">happen Ken governments do this can the</text>
  <text start="527.78" dur="8.52">people rise up and say no I hope so</text>
  <text start="532.48" dur="5.38">because if we don&amp;#39;t at this point</text>
  <text start="536.3" dur="5.13">because we&amp;#39;re at a crossroads right now</text>
  <text start="537.86" dur="7.31">if we don&amp;#39;t do this it&amp;#39;s looking like</text>
  <text start="541.43" dur="8.61">it&amp;#39;s game over they would have set up</text>
  <text start="545.17" dur="8.65">the one world government because they</text>
  <text start="550.04" dur="8.07">will have control the people will</text>
  <text start="553.82" dur="5.91">actually lose control and we can see</text>
  <text start="558.11" dur="5.94">this is exactly what they wanted from</text>
  <text start="559.73" dur="5.43">the beginning so the people around the</text>
  <text start="564.05" dur="2.67">world</text>
  <text start="565.16" dur="3.51">and we can see throughout Europe there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="566.72" dur="6.69">many many protests where people are</text>
  <text start="568.67" dur="7.409">saying no to TTIP notice seta no to all</text>
  <text start="573.41" dur="7.739">of this the people here in the United</text>
  <text start="576.079" dur="8.671">States we need to wake up we need to say</text>
  <text start="581.149" dur="5.521">no we need to tell our representatives</text>
  <text start="584.75" dur="4.529">which they really don&amp;#39;t represent us</text>
  <text start="586.67" dur="6.659">because it seems like they&amp;#39;re bought off</text>
  <text start="589.279" dur="5.071">by corporations central banks but we</text>
  <text start="593.329" dur="4.081">still have a little bit of a control</text>
  <text start="594.35" dur="5.82">because we can say listen we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="597.41" dur="5.489">voting for anyone unless you do what the</text>
  <text start="600.17" dur="7.5">people say or we make a move and we</text>
  <text start="602.899" dur="8.37">remove these individuals but we can see</text>
  <text start="607.67" dur="6.479">the people at this point the people need</text>
  <text start="611.269" dur="6.69">to start taking back the country the</text>
  <text start="614.149" dur="9.321">people need to say no to these</text>
  <text start="617.959" dur="8.13">individuals in government the government</text>
  <text start="623.47" dur="5.979">individuals who are there and I might</text>
  <text start="626.089" dur="5.25">even call them leaders they cannot take</text>
  <text start="629.449" dur="3.781">bribes they cannot take money from</text>
  <text start="631.339" dur="3.87">lobbyists they cannot take money from</text>
  <text start="633.23" dur="4.799">central bankers they cannot take money</text>
  <text start="635.209" dur="7.8">from corporations all of this should be</text>
  <text start="638.029" dur="6.24">stripped away because once you start</text>
  <text start="643.009" dur="3.421">taking money from all these different</text>
  <text start="644.269" dur="5.791">organizations those organizations</text>
  <text start="646.43" dur="7.259">control you and this is what corrupted a</text>
  <text start="650.06" dur="6.42">lot of the system because they take the</text>
  <text start="653.689" dur="4.051">money they report to the corporation to</text>
  <text start="656.48" dur="4.109">the central bank to a foreign government</text>
  <text start="657.74" dur="7.349">and they no longer work for the people</text>
  <text start="660.589" dur="8.521">and as this system is collapsing as this</text>
  <text start="665.089" dur="6.331">system is ripping itself apart we have</text>
  <text start="669.11" dur="5.339">an opportunity right now we have an</text>
  <text start="671.42" dur="6.529">opportunity say no more we&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="674.449" dur="8.61">this anymore we have an opportunity to</text>
  <text start="677.949" dur="8.14">repair things to remove the central bank</text>
  <text start="683.059" dur="6.241">and to replace those individuals that</text>
  <text start="686.089" dur="5.701">are corrupt so again we&amp;#39;re at a</text>
  <text start="689.3" dur="5.459">crossroads the people are going to have</text>
  <text start="691.79" dur="5.549">to decide what they want to do at a</text>
  <text start="694.759" dur="4.341">certain point listen everyone thanks a</text>
  <text start="697.339" dur="3.411">lot for listening be well be safe</text>
