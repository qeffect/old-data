  <text start="108.359" dur="7.591">is experiencing this firsthand remember</text>
  <text start="112.079" dur="5.79">the people voted for a brexit Theresa</text>
  <text start="115.95" dur="4.32">May was trying to hand them something</text>
  <text start="117.869" dur="4.771">completely different the people said you</text>
  <text start="120.27" dur="4.349">know something we reject this he tried</text>
  <text start="122.64" dur="4.229">this many many times to introduce the</text>
  <text start="124.619" dur="5.31">law to get it passed but it didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="126.869" dur="4.951">she resigned Boris Johnson he was</text>
  <text start="129.929" dur="5.581">elected saying we&amp;#39;re going to leave</text>
  <text start="131.82" dur="6.51">October 31st no matter what No Deal</text>
  <text start="135.51" dur="6.57">doesn&amp;#39;t make a difference we are leaving</text>
  <text start="138.33" dur="6.81">and we can see those elite those in the</text>
  <text start="142.08" dur="4.77">establishment those central bankers they</text>
  <text start="145.14" dur="2.13">don&amp;#39;t want this to happen now we knew</text>
  <text start="146.85" dur="2.55">this</text>
  <text start="147.27" dur="5.19">we knew the central banker their</text>
  <text start="149.4" dur="5.22">ultimate plan was to never ever let the</text>
  <text start="152.46" dur="6.24">UK leave they will do everything they</text>
  <text start="154.62" dur="6.66">possibly can to keep the UK because once</text>
  <text start="158.7" dur="4.69">the UK leaves and there&amp;#39;s an interim</text>
  <text start="161.28" dur="5.71">trade deal with the United States</text>
  <text start="163.39" dur="7.11">and after meant months without the EU</text>
  <text start="166.99" dur="5.67">and the UK starts to thrive other</text>
  <text start="170.5" dur="4.44">countries will look at this and say hey</text>
  <text start="172.66" dur="5.19">why don&amp;#39;t we do the same thing this is</text>
  <text start="174.94" dur="6.06">fantastic this is something they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="177.85" dur="6.9">want anyone to see this is why they will</text>
  <text start="181" dur="8.81">pressure and try to maneuver a way to</text>
  <text start="184.75" dur="7.97">keep the status quo but will it work</text>
  <text start="189.81" dur="6.12">most likely not Boris Johnson right now</text>
  <text start="192.72" dur="6.43">he is pushing as hard as he possibly can</text>
  <text start="195.93" dur="6.22">he is urging the UK Parliament to reject</text>
  <text start="199.15" dur="5.85">the bill that according to him should be</text>
  <text start="202.15" dur="6.21">known as Jeremy Corbyn surrender bill</text>
  <text start="205" dur="5.31">that would block a No Deal brexit he</text>
  <text start="208.36" dur="3.629">said there is one step that would</text>
  <text start="210.31" dur="3.81">jeopardize all the progress that we have</text>
  <text start="211.989" dur="4.951">made in the g7 and around the capitals</text>
  <text start="214.12" dur="5.25">of Europe and that is if the house were</text>
  <text start="216.94" dur="4.86">to decide that it was simply impossible</text>
  <text start="219.37" dur="4.86">for us to leave without a deal and to</text>
  <text start="221.8" dur="5.55">make that step illegal to force us</text>
  <text start="224.23" dur="7.44">that&amp;#39;s what they want to force us to beg</text>
  <text start="227.35" dur="7.08">for yet another pointless delay now</text>
  <text start="231.67" dur="5.97">think about what&amp;#39;s happening we have</text>
  <text start="234.43" dur="6.21">Jeremy Corbyn who is introducing a bill</text>
  <text start="237.64" dur="7.14">he wants a delay he wants to put this</text>
  <text start="240.64" dur="7.53">off and they&amp;#39;re pushing very hard Boris</text>
  <text start="244.78" dur="6.959">Johnson is pushing back now very</text>
  <text start="248.17" dur="7.349">interestingly Phillip Lee he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="251.739" dur="7.291">Conservative MP he decided to defect and</text>
  <text start="255.519" dur="6.481">what that means is johnson has lost his</text>
  <text start="259.03" dur="6">working parliamentary majority ahead of</text>
  <text start="262" dur="8.03">the crucial brexit now this was done on</text>
  <text start="265.03" dur="9.449">purpose to weaken Johnson now once again</text>
  <text start="270.03" dur="6.61">the people have spoken these are the</text>
  <text start="274.479" dur="5.611">establishment the non elected leaders</text>
  <text start="276.64" dur="6.06">that are pushing their side of it the</text>
  <text start="280.09" dur="4.949">people are pushing their side and I do</text>
  <text start="282.7" dur="5.58">believe that Boris Johnson he will not</text>
  <text start="285.039" dur="6.181">fold he will continually push forward</text>
  <text start="288.28" dur="5.699">remember the central bank they play</text>
  <text start="291.22" dur="5.1">dirty they will use any means necessary</text>
  <text start="293.979" dur="5.551">to stop this</text>
  <text start="296.32" dur="5.52">and Boris Johnson he understands this</text>
  <text start="299.53" dur="6.3">he knows his sotas Trump Trump knows</text>
  <text start="301.84" dur="5.55">that the central bank they will fight to</text>
  <text start="305.83" dur="5.07">the very end the deep state will fight</text>
  <text start="307.39" dur="4.64">to the very end now as we know here in</text>
  <text start="310.9" dur="4.62">the United States</text>
  <text start="312.03" dur="6.37">Trump is battling the swamp Trump is</text>
  <text start="315.52" dur="5.61">battling the central bank Trump is</text>
  <text start="318.4" dur="7.14">battling the mainstream media and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="321.13" dur="7.05">creating a parallel economy because we</text>
  <text start="325.54" dur="5.43">all know that the central bank system it</text>
  <text start="328.18" dur="5.4">cannot continue one it cannot continue</text>
  <text start="330.97" dur="4.86">in the way it is this is why the central</text>
  <text start="333.58" dur="3.99">bank was planning on a major reset with</text>
  <text start="335.83" dur="3.93">a major event they didn&amp;#39;t get that</text>
  <text start="337.57" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re exposed now Trump is continually</text>
  <text start="339.76" dur="3.45">pointing the finger at the Fed letting</text>
  <text start="341.5" dur="4.38">everyone know they&amp;#39;re the ones are going</text>
  <text start="343.21" dur="6.9">to be responsible when this system comes</text>
  <text start="345.88" dur="7.4">down it will be their doing not his but</text>
  <text start="350.11" dur="6.51">he needs some space here he needs time</text>
  <text start="353.28" dur="6.13">to create the trade deals to put</text>
  <text start="356.62" dur="6.27">everything in order so we can transition</text>
  <text start="359.41" dur="7.74">on the patriots timetable not on a</text>
  <text start="362.89" dur="6.9">central bank timetable and you can see</text>
  <text start="367.15" dur="4.68">that Trump he is making more deals with</text>
  <text start="369.79" dur="4.77">many many countries he tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="371.83" dur="4.8">following Brazil will allow more</text>
  <text start="374.56" dur="4.74">American ethanol to enter the country</text>
  <text start="376.63" dur="5.28">without tariffs a decision that the</text>
  <text start="379.3" dur="4.26">Brazilian mills are celebrating the</text>
  <text start="381.91" dur="3.69">seemingly counter intuitive reaction</text>
  <text start="383.56" dur="3.96">stems from the tone of ongoing</text>
  <text start="385.6" dur="4.2">negotiations between south america</text>
  <text start="387.52" dur="5.16">nation and the u.s. for a trade</text>
  <text start="389.8" dur="6.33">agreement making great progress for our</text>
  <text start="392.68" dur="5.16">farmers approved 8/15 year-round big</text>
  <text start="396.13" dur="4.2">additional list to be submitted and</text>
  <text start="397.84" dur="5.85">approved within two weeks will be even</text>
  <text start="400.33" dur="7.86">better for ethanol and we save our small</text>
  <text start="403.69" dur="6.93">refineries now in regards to China the</text>
  <text start="408.19" dur="4.41">deep state they believe they&amp;#39;ll be able</text>
  <text start="410.62" dur="4.26">to hold out they&amp;#39;re hoping that Trump</text>
  <text start="412.6" dur="4.05">will lose the election remember there</text>
  <text start="414.88" dur="4.56">are black sites there are deep state</text>
  <text start="416.65" dur="5.07">operatives in China we&amp;#39;ve seen it in</text>
  <text start="419.44" dur="4.95">many countries they&amp;#39;re hoping that Trump</text>
  <text start="421.72" dur="5.37">loses the election they want everything</text>
  <text start="424.39" dur="4.68">to go back to normal but Trump is out</text>
  <text start="427.09" dur="2.23">there saying listen it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="429.07" dur="2.62">have</text>
  <text start="429.32" dur="5.66">and think about it we have 16 months</text>
  <text start="431.69" dur="6.06">until the election a lot can happen</text>
  <text start="434.98" dur="5.23">during this period of time he tweeted</text>
  <text start="437.75" dur="4.92">out the following we are doing very well</text>
  <text start="440.21" dur="4.47">in our negotiations with China well I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="442.67" dur="4.41">sure they would love to be dealing with</text>
  <text start="444.68" dur="4.53">a new administration so they could</text>
  <text start="447.08" dur="5.46">continue their practice of ripoff USA</text>
  <text start="449.21" dur="6.21">600 billion a year 16 months plus is a</text>
  <text start="452.54" dur="6.81">long time to be hemorrhaging jobs and</text>
  <text start="455.42" dur="6.3">companies on a long shot and then think</text>
  <text start="459.35" dur="4.91">what happens to China when I went deal</text>
  <text start="461.72" dur="5.04">would get much tougher in the meantime</text>
  <text start="464.26" dur="4.69">China supply chain will crumble and</text>
  <text start="466.76" dur="5.28">businesses jobs and money will be gone</text>
  <text start="468.95" dur="4.95">and for all those geniuses out there</text>
  <text start="472.04" dur="4.14">many who have been in other</text>
  <text start="473.9" dur="5.01">administration&amp;#39;s and taken to the</text>
  <text start="476.18" dur="5.13">cleaners by China that want need to get</text>
  <text start="478.91" dur="5.04">together with the EU and others to go</text>
  <text start="481.31" dur="6.15">after China trade practices remember the</text>
  <text start="483.95" dur="8.34">EU and all treat us very unfairly on</text>
  <text start="487.46" dur="7.08">trade also will change and he&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="492.29" dur="4.11">to the deep state all those people that</text>
  <text start="494.54" dur="4.35">have been in government for a very long</text>
  <text start="496.4" dur="4.23">time saying no do it my way let&amp;#39;s do it</text>
  <text start="498.89" dur="4.35">this way they&amp;#39;re telling him this</text>
  <text start="500.63" dur="5.82">because they don&amp;#39;t want him to change</text>
  <text start="503.24" dur="5.57">anything they&amp;#39;ve already set up the</text>
  <text start="506.45" dur="6.029">system the way they wanted it remember</text>
  <text start="508.81" dur="7.84">they had an agenda he&amp;#39;s changing their</text>
  <text start="512.479" dur="7.891">agenda and China those individuals that</text>
  <text start="516.65" dur="6.24">are hoping that someone else is elected</text>
  <text start="520.37" dur="4.44">so they can keep everything the way it</text>
  <text start="522.89" dur="4.47">was it&amp;#39;s not going to happen and all</text>
  <text start="524.81" dur="6.78">those deep state operate operators in</text>
  <text start="527.36" dur="9.15">China it&amp;#39;s going to fail it will not</text>
  <text start="531.59" dur="8.1">work and once again if Trump wins it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="536.51" dur="8.07">going to be awful for China but again</text>
  <text start="539.69" dur="8.79">what&amp;#39;s the plan the plan is to bring the</text>
  <text start="544.58" dur="7.07">jobs back to the US by continuing with</text>
  <text start="548.48" dur="5.7">the tariffs by continuing with all this</text>
  <text start="551.65" dur="5.56">gee and Trump they have a very good</text>
  <text start="554.18" dur="6.24">relationship think about all the others</text>
  <text start="557.21" dur="4.99">who are pushing a certain agenda in</text>
  <text start="560.42" dur="4.95">China they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="562.2" dur="8.16">to push because they don&amp;#39;t want change</text>
  <text start="565.37" dur="8.17">they don&amp;#39;t want a new deal they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="570.36" dur="4.92">already set everything up the plan was</text>
  <text start="573.54" dur="5.36">supposed to be completely different than</text>
  <text start="575.28" dur="7.56">what&amp;#39;s happening today and they&amp;#39;re stuck</text>
  <text start="578.9" dur="6.64">Trump is right China they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="582.84" dur="5.67">struggling by the end of this he knows</text>
  <text start="585.54" dur="7.41">it they set it up so this is what</text>
  <text start="588.51" dur="7.52">happens so China has to say okay we give</text>
  <text start="592.95" dur="6.78">and this will happen the deal will</text>
  <text start="596.03" dur="8.74">happen now we know that the main mission</text>
  <text start="599.73" dur="6.54">for the Patriots is to remove the</text>
  <text start="604.77" dur="3.96">central bank system not just here in the</text>
  <text start="606.27" dur="4.83">United States but worldwide and again</text>
  <text start="608.73" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s going to take many countries to do</text>
  <text start="611.1" dur="6.81">this and like we said before Trump is</text>
  <text start="614.25" dur="6.6">going to continue with the attacks on</text>
  <text start="617.91" dur="5.01">the Fed he&amp;#39;s going to continually point</text>
  <text start="620.85" dur="3.96">the finger at the Fed letting everyone</text>
  <text start="622.92" dur="4.05">know that they&amp;#39;re the ones who are going</text>
  <text start="624.81" dur="4.77">to be responsible for when the system</text>
  <text start="626.97" dur="6.06">collapses when we move into a recession</text>
  <text start="629.58" dur="7.35">and you can see that he&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="633.03" dur="7.32">doing this he&amp;#39;s pointing his finger at</text>
  <text start="636.93" dur="6.6">the Fed saying listen if they do what I</text>
  <text start="640.35" dur="6.09">say the economy is going to do great if</text>
  <text start="643.53" dur="7.05">they decide not to do what I say they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="646.44" dur="6.57">going to be held responsible and if they</text>
  <text start="650.58" dur="4.92">decide to change course like raise rates</text>
  <text start="653.01" dur="5.16">and the economy falls apart it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="655.5" dur="4.98">feds fault Trump said I didn&amp;#39;t want you</text>
  <text start="658.17" dur="4.5">to do this if you did what I did the</text>
  <text start="660.48" dur="4.47">economy would be doing fantastically but</text>
  <text start="662.67" dur="5.46">we have to remember Trump is setting</text>
  <text start="664.95" dur="4.77">this narrative up on purpose and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="668.13" dur="5.22">going to continue with the attacks</text>
  <text start="669.72" dur="7.74">because he needs the people to</text>
  <text start="673.35" dur="7.49">understand that the Fed is to blame no</text>
  <text start="677.46" dur="6">matter what he tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="680.84" dur="4.66">Germany and so many other countries have</text>
  <text start="683.46" dur="4.11">negative interest rates they get paid</text>
  <text start="685.5" dur="5.1">for loaning money and our Federal</text>
