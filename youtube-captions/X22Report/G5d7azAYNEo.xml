  <text start="58.219" dur="5.79">unsold homes during the last housing</text>

  <text start="74.509" dur="4.92">can&amp;#39;t be shut off overnight oversupply</text>
  <text start="76.849" dur="5.431">is a powerful force in the market and</text>
  <text start="79.429" dur="6.481">what we&amp;#39;re seeing today is the same</text>
  <text start="82.28" dur="6.8">exact thing where all of a sudden people</text>
  <text start="85.91" dur="5.689">are slowing down in purchasing homes</text>
  <text start="89.08" dur="4.929">mortgage applications are declining</text>
  <text start="91.599" dur="6.401">builders are still building and this is</text>
  <text start="94.009" dur="5.941">why we see their optimism up there their</text>
  <text start="98" dur="3.569">hope that people are going to buy them</text>
  <text start="99.95" dur="3.99">but what&amp;#39;s happening as the prices start</text>
  <text start="101.569" dur="4.351">coming down and in many places they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="103.94" dur="4.019">leveling off other places they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="105.92" dur="3.96">down yes there are few places where</text>
  <text start="107.959" dur="3.091">they&amp;#39;re still rising but don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="109.88" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re going to get hit and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="111.05" dur="3.929">going to start coming down they have</text>
  <text start="113" dur="5.069">already had their permits they already</text>
  <text start="114.979" dur="6.48">had started construction and we saw this</text>
  <text start="118.069" dur="5.22">back in 2007-2008 and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="121.459" dur="4.711">everything came to a screeching halt now</text>
  <text start="123.289" dur="6.051">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the home</text>
  <text start="126.17" dur="5.73">flippers this is starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="129.34" dur="4.869">flipping has started to run out of air</text>
  <text start="131.9" dur="4.37">in much of the country and in the multi</text>
  <text start="134.209" dur="4.861">county metro area of San Francisco</text>
  <text start="136.27" dur="3.46">flipping collapsed in the second quarter</text>
  <text start="139.07" dur="2.699">and flip</text>
  <text start="139.73" dur="4.649">for the first time in years started</text>
  <text start="141.769" dur="4.411">losing money on their homes home sales</text>
  <text start="144.379" dur="3.841">in the US have been declining since last</text>
  <text start="146.18" dur="4.139">fall with mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="148.22" dur="4.98">plummeting at double-digit rates</text>
  <text start="150.319" dur="6.03">year-over-year flipping as a business</text>
  <text start="153.2" dur="5.819">model is suddenly no longer so appealing</text>
  <text start="156.349" dur="4.53">home sales overall are dropping flipping</text>
  <text start="159.019" dur="3.961">as a percentage of total sales has</text>
  <text start="160.879" dur="4.231">swooned and profits have come under</text>
  <text start="162.98" dur="4.47">pressure and the time it takes to flip a</text>
  <text start="165.11" dur="5.34">home has soared year-over-year the</text>
  <text start="167.45" dur="4.89">volume of flips has plunged 61 percent</text>
  <text start="170.45" dur="5.31">and like I said I looked around the</text>
  <text start="172.34" dur="5.13">country and I went into zillow you can</text>
  <text start="175.76" dur="5.009">go right into that and you can compare</text>
  <text start="177.47" dur="5.25">to realtor.com and you go into the</text>
  <text start="180.769" dur="4.47">different areas and you see in the</text>
  <text start="182.72" dur="4.019">northeast the south and the West you see</text>
  <text start="185.239" dur="4.321">homes where they&amp;#39;ve been on the market</text>
  <text start="186.739" dur="4.291">for 60 90 120 days we&amp;#39;re coming out of</text>
  <text start="189.56" dur="3.149">the summer months and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="191.03" dur="3.959">lowering their prices I see some houses</text>
  <text start="192.709" dur="4.62">where they lowered their price three</text>
  <text start="194.989" dur="5.131">times already trying to get rid of it</text>
  <text start="197.329" dur="5.581">and still they&amp;#39;re overpriced and this is</text>
  <text start="200.12" dur="6.6">exactly what happened starting in 2007</text>
  <text start="202.91" dur="5.759">going into 2008 and it just got worse</text>
  <text start="206.72" dur="4.65">and this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="208.669" dur="5.1">right now now a couple reports ago I</text>
  <text start="211.37" dur="5.82">discussed about how Russia is trying to</text>
  <text start="213.769" dur="5.34">create a swift type of banking network</text>
  <text start="217.19" dur="4.31">system to be separate and apart from the</text>
  <text start="219.109" dur="6.181">west and it already looks like the</text>
  <text start="221.5" dur="6.849">western central bankers are looking to</text>
  <text start="225.29" dur="4.919">kick Russia out of the Swift banking</text>
  <text start="228.349" dur="3.631">network the British government will</text>
  <text start="230.209" dur="4.201">press other European nations at a</text>
  <text start="231.98" dur="4.05">meeting in Brussels on saturday to block</text>
  <text start="234.41" dur="3.81">Russia from using the Swift banking</text>
  <text start="236.03" dur="4.709">network blocking Russia from the Swift</text>
  <text start="238.22" dur="4.71">system would be a very serious</text>
  <text start="240.739" dur="4.47">escalation and sanctions against Russia</text>
  <text start="242.93" dur="5.33">and would most certainly result in</text>
  <text start="245.209" dur="7.231">equally tough retaliatory sanctions</text>
  <text start="248.26" dur="7.96">against the against the West here so we</text>
  <text start="252.44" dur="6.69">can see right now that all of this is an</text>
  <text start="256.22" dur="5.79">economic war and like i said before has</text>
  <text start="259.13" dur="5.009">this economic war heats up it leads into</text>
  <text start="262.01" dur="4.56">real war and we&amp;#39;re definitely seeing</text>
  <text start="264.139" dur="4.981">this right now now we know people are</text>
  <text start="266.57" dur="4.98">trying to leave the country or they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="269.12" dur="4.37">trying to renounce their citizenship we</text>
  <text start="271.55" dur="5.4">understand that FATCA</text>
  <text start="273.49" dur="6.13">with this new law in place you have to</text>
  <text start="276.95" dur="4.38">report your bank holdings actually the</text>
  <text start="279.62" dur="3.99">banks will do it for you you have to</text>
  <text start="281.33" dur="4.59">report your earnings and you&amp;#39;ll be taxed</text>
  <text start="283.61" dur="3.48">EE and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a lot of</text>
  <text start="285.92" dur="2.79">people are saying you know what I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="287.09" dur="3.84">want to be part of this anymore so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="288.71" dur="4.62">renouncing my citizenship now it used to</text>
  <text start="290.93" dur="6.12">be free when you want it to renounce</text>
  <text start="293.33" dur="5.34">your citizenship and then of course the</text>
  <text start="297.05" dur="4.14">State Department says you know what we</text>
  <text start="298.67" dur="4.47">shouldn&amp;#39;t have it for anymore let&amp;#39;s put</text>
  <text start="301.19" dur="5.1">a four hundred and fifty dollar fee on</text>
  <text start="303.14" dur="5.25">this and right now yesterday well that</text>
  <text start="306.29" dur="3.9">four hundred out of fee went all the way</text>
  <text start="308.39" dur="3.6">up to two thousand three hundred and</text>
  <text start="310.19" dur="4.59">fifty dollars that&amp;#39;s a four hundred and</text>
  <text start="311.99" dur="4.08">twenty two percent increase because the</text>
  <text start="314.78" dur="2.94">number of people who are renouncing</text>
  <text start="316.07" dur="4.2">their citizenship is continually</text>
  <text start="317.72" dur="4.05">climbing and they&amp;#39;re realizing this and</text>
  <text start="320.27" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re trying to make it difficult for</text>
  <text start="321.77" dur="3.57">people to get out if you want to get out</text>
  <text start="323.36" dur="3.9">guess what they&amp;#39;re going to bring</text>
  <text start="325.34" dur="3.15">revenue into the government and this is</text>
  <text start="327.26" dur="3.27">what it&amp;#39;s for and of course using the</text>
  <text start="328.49" dur="4.29">excuses like all the processing and the</text>
  <text start="330.53" dur="4.23">paperwork there&amp;#39;s no processing and</text>
  <text start="332.78" dur="4.71">paperwork this is the excuse that people</text>
  <text start="334.76" dur="6.66">use to push the prices up that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="337.49" dur="6.93">that is now with regards to Ebola it</text>
  <text start="341.42" dur="6.51">seems like Ebola now is spreading to the</text>
  <text start="344.42" dur="5.91">sixth African nation and there are 20</text>
  <text start="347.93" dur="4.11">cases in seminole now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="350.33" dur="5.25">interesting that all of this is taking</text>
  <text start="352.04" dur="9.63">place in the east coast of Africa right</text>
  <text start="355.58" dur="9.66">here and we&amp;#39;re seeing that Guinea Sierra</text>
  <text start="361.67" dur="6.48">Leone Liberia those have all the latest</text>
  <text start="365.24" dur="4.77">outbreaks and countries under threat are</text>
  <text start="368.15" dur="4.35">like the ivory coast which are which is</text>
  <text start="370.01" dur="6.45">right next to Liberia we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="372.5" dur="6.96">Nigeria has been infected mally right</text>
  <text start="376.46" dur="7.17">now is under threat the Congo we</text>
  <text start="379.46" dur="6.75">understand is pretty much separate Ebola</text>
  <text start="383.63" dur="5.04">type of strain and we&amp;#39;re seeing it</text>
  <text start="386.21" dur="4.56">spread out all across Africa here and of</text>
  <text start="388.67" dur="4.17">course it&amp;#39;s hurting business it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="390.77" dur="3.72">hurting the Chinese from coming in and</text>
  <text start="392.84" dur="3.6">pouring in billions of dollars in</text>
  <text start="394.49" dur="4.05">infrastructure and it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="396.44" dur="4.92">really look like that this was set up as</text>
  <text start="398.54" dur="5.25">a tactic to pretty much have business</text>
  <text start="401.36" dur="5.07">come to a screeching halt and keep China</text>
  <text start="403.79" dur="3.48">out of this area now of course as</text>
  <text start="406.43" dur="3.69">reports that</text>
  <text start="407.27" dur="4.95">you know Ebola will be spreading and</text>
  <text start="410.12" dur="4.47">I&amp;#39;ll be reaching about 20,000 people and</text>
  <text start="412.22" dur="5.85">we know we have this so-called vaccine</text>
  <text start="414.59" dur="5.61">called zmapp which is really not curing</text>
  <text start="418.07" dur="4.23">the people who have Ebola because those</text>
  <text start="420.2" dur="4.26">people have died from it and other</text>
  <text start="422.3" dur="5.46">people have recovered from it so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="424.46" dur="5.88">real no valid proof that this is</text>
  <text start="427.76" dur="6.69">actually working and again I do believe</text>
  <text start="430.34" dur="6.15">this is a manufactured strain it is put</text>
  <text start="434.45" dur="4.17">there on purpose because they needed a</text>
  <text start="436.49" dur="4.5">way to stop what was happening in Africa</text>
  <text start="438.62" dur="4.71">the way the United States normally does</text>
  <text start="440.99" dur="4.26">it they follow the playbook of terrorism</text>
  <text start="443.33" dur="3.78">inside the country countries usually let</text>
  <text start="445.25" dur="3.57">the United States government come on in</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="3.96">the central banker set up all their</text>
  <text start="448.82" dur="4.05">forces and of course China is right</text>
  <text start="451.07" dur="3.78">there but a lot of the countries are</text>
  <text start="452.87" dur="3.72">saying you know what we don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="454.85" dur="3.69">central bankers in here we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="456.59" dur="3.66">the troops in here so it looks like the</text>
  <text start="458.54" dur="4.68">US government is trying a different</text>
  <text start="460.25" dur="10.01">tactic and using biological warfare in</text>
  <text start="463.22" dur="11.22">this area now we understand that Libya</text>
  <text start="470.26" dur="6.28">Lebanon Yemen and of course Pakistan all</text>
  <text start="474.44" dur="4.05">the people there the tribes are rising</text>
  <text start="476.54" dur="5.61">up taking back their countries and it</text>
  <text start="478.49" dur="6.57">looks like in Pakistan but the people</text>
  <text start="482.15" dur="5.64">there are saying we want this government</text>
  <text start="485.06" dur="5.58">completely out of here police are firing</text>
  <text start="487.79" dur="5.04">tear gas on about 8,000 people who have</text>
  <text start="490.64" dur="4.41">gathered in the city center demanding</text>
  <text start="492.83" dur="4.05">the Prime Minister resignation a group</text>
  <text start="495.05" dur="3.3">of protesters threatened to march on the</text>
  <text start="496.88" dur="3.93">Prime Minister&amp;#39;s house to force them to</text>
  <text start="498.35" dur="4.2">quit now we&amp;#39;re not hearing much about</text>
  <text start="500.81" dur="4.14">this in the corporate media anywhere</text>
  <text start="502.55" dur="4.29">because of course you have to remember</text>
  <text start="504.95" dur="3.68">in Pakistan they were using the drone</text>
  <text start="506.84" dur="4.86">strikes and they use a lot of them in</text>
  <text start="508.63" dur="5.89">Pakistan to keep the al-qaeda terrorists</text>
  <text start="511.7" dur="4.86">back and of course this didn&amp;#39;t work and</text>
  <text start="514.52" dur="4.68">now the people are rising up and if you</text>
  <text start="516.56" dur="6">notice the difference between the</text>
  <text start="519.2" dur="5.25">Islamic state and the tribes rising up</text>
  <text start="522.56" dur="4.05">in the country and I remember they</text>
  <text start="524.45" dur="4.59">called all of these people al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="526.61" dur="4.53">these were all terrorists if these are</text>
  <text start="529.04" dur="4.77">people all terrorists why aren&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="531.14" dur="6.72">out there like the Islamic state saying</text>
  <text start="533.81" dur="5.64">oh we want to you know take back the</text>
  <text start="537.86" dur="2.7">country we&amp;#39;re going to kill anyone we</text>
  <text start="539.45" dur="2.91">want</text>
  <text start="540.56" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re not doing this because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="542.36" dur="5.85">actually the people the manufactured</text>
  <text start="545.24" dur="5.66">Islamic state is controlled by the US</text>
  <text start="548.21" dur="5.4">government the UK and if you notice</text>
  <text start="550.9" dur="5.53">every time they come out with something</text>
  <text start="553.61" dur="5.01">they like to broadcast it to the world</text>
  <text start="556.43" dur="4.53">to make sure everyone understands and</text>
  <text start="558.62" dur="6.24">knows what&amp;#39;s going on and the reason for</text>
  <text start="560.96" dur="6.99">this is because they need everyone to be</text>
  <text start="564.86" dur="5.94">afraid be scared of what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="567.95" dur="6.93">happen be scared of a an event that will</text>
  <text start="570.8" dur="6.12">happen on a European soil UK soil the</text>
  <text start="574.88" dur="5.43">United States and they&amp;#39;re pushing the</text>
  <text start="576.92" dur="6.15">terror factor really really hard right</text>
  <text start="580.31" dur="4.62">now but a true organization that is</text>
  <text start="583.07" dur="4.32">trying to form a Caliphate or anything</text>
  <text start="584.93" dur="4.11">like that would do it quietly so no one</text>
  <text start="587.39" dur="3.99">really knows about it and if you notice</text>
  <text start="589.04" dur="5.61">this is now is this is not what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="591.38" dur="5.73">happening out in Iraq and Syria and</text>
  <text start="594.65" dur="6.03">you&amp;#39;ll see that as the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="597.11" dur="5.85">pushes further towards Damascus because</text>
  <text start="600.68" dur="4.11">eventually you know the United States is</text>
  <text start="602.96" dur="3.9">going to try to get into Syria anyway</text>
  <text start="604.79" dur="4.23">they possibly can most likely with some</text>
  <text start="606.86" dur="5.1">type of event we don&amp;#39;t know what this is</text>
  <text start="609.02" dur="4.74">exactly going to be yet but soon we will</text>
  <text start="611.96" dur="3.24">know and you&amp;#39;ll start to see them start</text>
  <text start="613.76" dur="4.02">the bomb and they&amp;#39;ll come out report</text>
  <text start="615.2" dur="5.4">saying oh my god the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="617.78" dur="5.88">moving further and further north into</text>
  <text start="620.6" dur="5.489">the Damascus area pushing and we have to</text>
  <text start="623.66" dur="4.83">further bond them into this area and</text>
  <text start="626.089" dur="6.381">this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing now in</text>
  <text start="628.49" dur="6.87">regards to Ukraine the US Department</text>
  <text start="632.47" dur="5.44">issued a warning to all US citizens</text>

  <text start="726.41" dur="4.32">already telling everyone that there</text>
  <text start="728.66" dur="3.839">could be a war and we already knew this</text>
  <text start="730.73" dur="3.359">from going back if you listen to my</text>
  <text start="732.499" dur="4.65">reports going all the way back from the</text>

  <text start="737.149" dur="4.141">moving to all different places every</text>
  <text start="739.519" dur="3.961">single day now why I do this every day</text>
  <text start="741.29" dur="4.409">and everyone saw me you know you know do</text>
  <text start="743.48" dur="4.349">it once a week do it this day the reason</text>
  <text start="745.699" dur="4.651">why I specifically did it every single</text>
  <text start="747.829" dur="6.12">day except for sunday I wanted everyone</text>
  <text start="750.35" dur="7.349">to see exactly how this takes place</text>
  <text start="753.949" dur="5.671">every single day and how they maneuver</text>
  <text start="757.699" dur="4.26">all of this because without seeing this</text>
  <text start="759.62" dur="4.379">you really can&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="761.959" dur="3.48">on so if you see military assets being</text>
  <text start="763.999" dur="3.241">moved every day and of course everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="765.439" dur="4.2">saying it&amp;#39;s not for war they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="767.24" dur="6.689">doing it but now you can see why all</text>
  <text start="769.639" dur="6.57">this has taken place back in 2013 when I</text>
  <text start="773.929" dur="4.681">said their goal is always the same to</text>
  <text start="776.209" dur="4.98">get into Syria it will never change here</text>
  <text start="778.61" dur="4.169">we are one year later and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="781.189" dur="3.781">building up the propaganda all</text>
  <text start="782.779" dur="5.521">throughout the year preparing the new</text>
  <text start="784.97" dur="5.369">plan getting everything ready to go and</text>
  <text start="788.3" dur="4.68">we can see this so if we go back to the</text>
  <text start="790.339" dur="5.79">last false flag event and go forward we</text>
  <text start="792.98" dur="5.219">see how all all of this fits in to what</text>
  <text start="796.129" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;re doing and their goal has never</text>
  <text start="798.199" dur="9.45">ever changed just their tactics that is</text>
  <text start="802.399" dur="5.581">it now we know that the US government is</text>
  <text start="807.649" dur="3.211">can</text>
  <text start="807.98" dur="5.82">continually bombing in Iraq and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="810.86" dur="6.03">interesting about this is how much money</text>
  <text start="813.8" dur="6.51">it is costing every day in Iraq right</text>
  <text start="816.89" dur="9.21">now it&amp;#39;s costing 7.5 million dollars a</text>
  <text start="820.31" dur="7.8">day to be in Iraq so we can see all of</text>
  <text start="826.1" dur="3.78">this money that is being wasted in Iraq</text>
  <text start="828.11" dur="3.27">could be used here in the United States</text>
  <text start="829.88" dur="3.36">I mean they&amp;#39;re telling us there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="831.38" dur="5.64">money for veterans there&amp;#39;s telling us</text>
  <text start="833.24" dur="5.76">there&amp;#39;s absolutely no money for the</text>
  <text start="837.02" dur="3.54">border guards around the United States</text>
  <text start="839" dur="3.33">there&amp;#39;s telling us there&amp;#39;s no money for</text>
  <text start="840.56" dur="3.63">the infrastructure they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="842.33" dur="4.05">that they have to tax us more but</text>
  <text start="844.19" dur="3.42">there&amp;#39;s no problem in spending 7.5</text>
  <text start="846.38" dur="3.78">million dollars and let&amp;#39;s not even</text>
  <text start="847.61" dur="6.24">forget about all the aid that is sent to</text>
  <text start="850.16" dur="6.78">all of these countries to continually</text>
  <text start="853.85" dur="5.46">prompt them up to keep the puppet</text>
  <text start="856.94" dur="6.12">government running and you can see right</text>
  <text start="859.31" dur="6.66">now that all of this is being driven by</text>
  <text start="863.06" dur="5.97">the bankers because if there was a true</text>
  <text start="865.97" dur="5.07">government for the people all of this</text>
  <text start="869.03" dur="4.59">would not be happening this is for the</text>
  <text start="871.04" dur="5.34">bankers they know their system is dying</text>
  <text start="873.62" dur="5.22">they know they have to start a World War</text>
  <text start="876.38" dur="5.58">and this is to cover it up it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="878.84" dur="5.43">going to stop it it&amp;#39;s just to direct the</text>
  <text start="881.96" dur="3.63">blame onto another group and country and</text>
  <text start="884.27" dur="3.69">you can see how they&amp;#39;re pushing this</text>
  <text start="885.59" dur="6.24">very very hard now yesterday I mentioned</text>
  <text start="887.96" dur="6.12">about cyber attacks on the banking</text>
  <text start="891.83" dur="5.34">institutions and how they would use the</text>
  <text start="894.08" dur="5.37">balance and how the FDIC really doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="897.17" dur="6.24">cover much now we have to look at this</text>
  <text start="899.45" dur="7.11">and the FDIC actually said that their</text>
  <text start="903.41" dur="7.68">deposit insurance protection does not</text>
  <text start="906.56" dur="9.6">apply in the case of theft or fraud or</text>
  <text start="911.09" dur="7.11">any type of physical or cyber attack and</text>
  <text start="916.16" dur="4.47">you have to look in your terms of</text>
  <text start="918.2" dur="4.8">service on your banks because they might</text>
  <text start="920.63" dur="6.33">not say cyber attack but they might say</text>
  <text start="923" dur="6.26">computer outage they will say war I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="926.96" dur="5.34">seen a bank of america it says strikes</text>
  <text start="929.26" dur="4.96">don&amp;#39;t know what strikes are but there</text>
  <text start="932.3" dur="3.3">they have them all listed in there and</text>
  <text start="934.22" dur="3.09">you can look at your own banks and see</text>
  <text start="935.6" dur="3.63">what they had listed there now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="937.31" dur="4.37">saying that the banks do have insurance</text>
  <text start="939.23" dur="6.08">for any type of</text>
  <text start="941.68" dur="5.79">or cyber attack but again you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="945.31" dur="4.89">what this insurance covers this is not</text>
  <text start="947.47" dur="4.83">the FDIC insurance it&amp;#39;s their own</text>
  <text start="950.2" dur="4.079">personal insurance so how much have</text>
  <text start="952.3" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;ve taken out how much does it cover</text>
  <text start="954.279" dur="7.321">will it cover a wide sprayed widespread</text>
  <text start="957.88" dur="6.42">attack on the banking system most likely</text>
  <text start="961.6" dur="4.859">not and let me just say once the</text>
  <text start="964.3" dur="5.159">financial institution Goes Down and we</text>
  <text start="966.459" dur="5.791">collapse you are not going to see any</text>
  <text start="969.459" dur="5.041">type of insurance money coming through</text>
  <text start="972.25" dur="4.14">whatsoever and this is why they have the</text>
  <text start="974.5" dur="4.709">bail in documents because they realize</text>
  <text start="976.39" dur="4.889">the banks are insolvent they will have</text>
  <text start="979.209" dur="3.391">to go into the bank take the rest of the</text>
  <text start="981.279" dur="2.701">money of course when they siphon out</text>
  <text start="982.6" dur="3.27">this money in your account goes to zero</text>
  <text start="983.98" dur="3.84">you know they just took it this was in</text>
  <text start="985.87" dur="3.69">another country this was a false flag</text>
  <text start="987.82" dur="4.23">event to make you think it was another</text>
  <text start="989.56" dur="6.06">country taking the money but again China</text>
  <text start="992.05" dur="4.979">Russia most likely these are the company</text>
  <text start="995.62" dur="4.71">probably russia they&amp;#39;re going to blame</text>
  <text start="997.029" dur="5.791">this on they don&amp;#39;t have to go into the</text>
  <text start="1000.33" dur="4.62">banks and steal the dollars or collapse</text>
  <text start="1002.82" dur="3.81">it this way it&amp;#39;d be much easier for them</text>
  <text start="1004.95" dur="3.57">to get together with China and just say</text>
  <text start="1006.63" dur="3.75">you know what we&amp;#39;re getting rid of our</text>
  <text start="1008.52" dur="4.5">reserves dollars we&amp;#39;re dumping the</text>
  <text start="1010.38" dur="4.95">Treasury&amp;#39;s good luck and that would</text>
  <text start="1013.02" dur="5.37">completely collapse the system now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1015.33" dur="5.1">seeing continuing threats out there the</text>
  <text start="1018.39" dur="4.11">Islamic state has declared Denmark an</text>
  <text start="1020.43" dur="5.519">enemy of Islam and the country is on the</text>
  <text start="1022.5" dur="5.699">militant organizations radar and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1025.949" dur="4.86">saying that we&amp;#39;re coming to get you now</text>
  <text start="1028.199" dur="6.811">of course they have to make the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1030.809" dur="6.061">state batter scarier than al-qaeda and</text>
  <text start="1035.01" dur="4.53">like I said in my other reports they</text>
  <text start="1036.87" dur="5.25">will be combining this and it will just</text>
  <text start="1039.54" dur="4.649">be the Islamic state al Qaeda lost all</text>
  <text start="1042.12" dur="3.9">the fear factor nobody really cared</text>
  <text start="1044.189" dur="3.691">anymore so they had to come up with this</text>
  <text start="1046.02" dur="3.18">and I know there the whole entire system</text>
  <text start="1047.88" dur="3.21">is collapsing when I say they it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1049.2" dur="4.56">central bank with US government so this</text>
  <text start="1051.09" dur="4.5">is why they created this and they still</text>
  <text start="1053.76" dur="4.5">believe if they get into Syria and then</text>
  <text start="1055.59" dur="4.71">eventually get into Iran this will solve</text>
  <text start="1058.26" dur="3.84">their problems they&amp;#39;re still using this</text>
  <text start="1060.3" dur="3.3">and if it doesn&amp;#39;t solve the problems</text>
  <text start="1062.1" dur="3.39">they don&amp;#39;t really care because Russia</text>
  <text start="1063.6" dur="4.32">and China are on the other side and they</text>
  <text start="1065.49" dur="5.55">know we will then go into war and they</text>
  <text start="1067.92" dur="5.28">can say I the event the war this is what</text>
  <text start="1071.04" dur="3.99">caused everything and they&amp;#39;re off the</text>
  <text start="1073.2" dur="2.4">hook and this is why we need to get</text>
  <text start="1075.03" dur="2.79">everyone</text>
  <text start="1075.6" dur="4.319">around the world together on the page</text>
  <text start="1077.82" dur="4.71">saying we know what you&amp;#39;re doing and</text>
  <text start="1079.919" dur="3.841">this is why I said those people in other</text>
  <text start="1082.53" dur="3.42">countries who speak two different</text>
  <text start="1083.76" dur="3.63">languages I wish I did speak a different</text>
