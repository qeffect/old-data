  <text start="189.63" dur="5.1">the most transparent administration in</text>
  <text start="191.82" dur="5.22">history well we&amp;#39;re starting to find out</text>
  <text start="194.73" dur="3.9">that this is fake phony and false pretty</text>
  <text start="197.04" dur="4.38">much like almost everything else the</text>
  <text start="198.63" dur="4.55">president talks about and in 2015 the</text>
  <text start="201.42" dur="6">government failed to disclose any</text>
  <text start="203.18" dur="6.55">documents for nearly 130,000 Freedom of</text>
  <text start="207.42" dur="5.49">Information Act requests and this is</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="5.37">coming from The Associated Press the FBI</text>
  <text start="212.91" dur="4.77">failed to find any related documents the</text>
  <text start="215.1" dur="4.65">thirty-nine percent of the FOI a request</text>
  <text start="217.68" dur="4.47">it received while Customs and Border</text>
  <text start="219.75" dur="3.84">Protection&amp;#39;s came up empty-handed thirty</text>

  <text start="232.59" dur="6.63">the information requested seventy-seven</text>
  <text start="236.28" dur="4.98">percent of all cases the Obama</text>
  <text start="239.22" dur="4.35">administration either either censored</text>
  <text start="241.26" dur="5.4">document it turned over or simply</text>
  <text start="243.57" dur="5.28">withheld the releases that amounted to</text>
  <text start="246.66" dur="6.78">about five hundred and ninety six</text>
  <text start="248.85" dur="9.5">thousand cases and also it set a new</text>
  <text start="253.44" dur="7.98">record in 250,000 of these cases the</text>
  <text start="258.35" dur="5.23">administration said it just couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="261.42" dur="7.08">find any records that the request was</text>
  <text start="263.58" dur="7.05">unreasonable or improper under the FOI a</text>
  <text start="268.5" dur="4.41">rules individual organizations</text>
  <text start="270.63" dur="4.35">journalists who make requests should be</text>
  <text start="272.91" dur="4.71">given access to the documents in</text>
  <text start="274.98" dur="5.24">question except in cases of course if</text>
  <text start="277.62" dur="6.89">it&amp;#39;s a violation of privacy rights if</text>
  <text start="280.22" dur="8.56">they reveal any type of trade secrets or</text>
  <text start="284.51" dur="6.61">of course national security but in these</text>
  <text start="288.78" dur="4.35">other cases none of these were cited and</text>
  <text start="291.12" dur="4.73">it seems like they just didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="293.13" dur="2.72">hand over information</text>
  <text start="297.35" dur="8.54">now the UN is planning and they made an</text>
  <text start="302.39" dur="6.3">announcement that they want to track all</text>
  <text start="305.89" dur="5.77">citizens wherever they may be on the</text>
  <text start="308.69" dur="4.74">planet biometrically and we know with</text>
  <text start="311.66" dur="3.06">the Real ID and here in the united</text>
  <text start="313.43" dur="3">states where they want all states to</text>
  <text start="314.72" dur="3.84">come into compliance they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="316.43" dur="3.45">track your DNA they want to track your</text>
  <text start="318.56" dur="3.12">iris scan they want to track your</text>
  <text start="319.88" dur="5.22">fingerprint they want to put an hour if</text>
  <text start="321.68" dur="6.21">ID chip in the real ID and we see the UN</text>
  <text start="325.1" dur="6.6">is heading in the same direction they</text>
  <text start="327.89" dur="9.87">want biometric identification where they</text>
  <text start="331.7" dur="9.03">can identify every single person the UN</text>
  <text start="337.76" dur="5.46">wants to collect and store data on your</text>
  <text start="340.73" dur="6.09">facial features your fingerprints your</text>
  <text start="343.22" dur="7.47">iris codes DNA and anything else that</text>
  <text start="346.82" dur="8.01">might help them to identify each one of</text>
  <text start="350.69" dur="7.83">us this information will then be stored</text>
  <text start="354.83" dur="7.89">in a central database in Geneva and use</text>
  <text start="358.52" dur="7.65">to improve our lives I don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="362.72" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s going to improve my life actually I</text>
  <text start="366.17" dur="3.39">think it&amp;#39;s going to make my life a lot</text>
  <text start="367.76" dur="4.59">harder and it&amp;#39;s probably make everyone</text>
  <text start="369.56" dur="5.19">else&amp;#39;s life harder because every time</text>
  <text start="372.35" dur="5.42">they do something like that it&amp;#39;s not for</text>
  <text start="374.75" dur="5.13">your benefit it&amp;#39;s for their benefit and</text>
  <text start="377.77" dur="4.87">what they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="379.88" dur="6.99">going to take this information and banks</text>
  <text start="382.64" dur="8.55">are going to be able to acquire this</text>
  <text start="386.87" dur="6.36">information I mean Citigroup right now</text>
  <text start="391.19" dur="4.77">is currently testing a new type of ATM</text>
  <text start="393.23" dur="5.25">that requires smartphone information I</text>
  <text start="395.96" dur="6.39">scanning technology in order to get your</text>
  <text start="398.48" dur="6.24">cash and we can see right now is they</text>
  <text start="402.35" dur="6.9">will use this information to create</text>
  <text start="404.72" dur="7.94">profiles of you to create a some type of</text>
  <text start="409.25" dur="7.08">social credit score system on you and</text>
  <text start="412.66" dur="6.13">they can make your life difficult if you</text>
  <text start="416.33" dur="5.37">don&amp;#39;t pay or they can ease up on you if</text>
  <text start="418.79" dur="7.2">you follow their directions exactly and</text>
  <text start="421.7" dur="7.05">this will allow them to have full and</text>
  <text start="425.99" dur="4.739">total control over every single person</text>
  <text start="428.75" dur="5.999">now they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="430.729" dur="9.33">push this so they can have this ready</text>
  <text start="434.749" dur="8.81">and mandatory by 2020 so we can see</text>
  <text start="440.059" dur="6.72">where their thought process is going</text>
  <text start="443.559" dur="6.991">basically they want control over every</text>
  <text start="446.779" dur="3.771">single person</text>
  <text start="456.65" dur="3.93">now out in turkey we see in Saturday</text>
  <text start="459.05" dur="4.47">there was a suicide bomber it was caught</text>
  <text start="460.58" dur="4.53">on CCTV and it&amp;#39;s amazing how the camera</text>
  <text start="463.52" dur="3.3">focused right on the person they knew</text>
  <text start="465.11" dur="3.809">exactly where he was going to be they</text>
  <text start="466.82" dur="5.879">knew where to focus on and one thing</text>
  <text start="468.919" dur="6.691">that I notice about the CCTV cameras is</text>
  <text start="472.699" dur="5.401">they really don&amp;#39;t prevent anything do</text>
  <text start="475.61" dur="6.649">they prevent what just happened this</text>
  <text start="478.1" dur="8.939">false flag and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="482.259" dur="7.63">turkey is continually having these false</text>
  <text start="487.039" dur="5.401">flags now of course this one is a little</text>
  <text start="489.889" dur="5.101">different because this one they&amp;#39;ve used</text>
  <text start="492.44" dur="5.64">DNA evidence from the pieces that they</text>
  <text start="494.99" dur="7.709">picked up and they knew exactly which</text>
  <text start="498.08" dur="8.52">family to test them against and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="502.699" dur="8.03">not blaming it on the PKK the tak this</text>
  <text start="506.6" dur="7.47">one was an Isis bombing now we know</text>
  <text start="510.729" dur="6.19">turkey supports the Islamic state we</text>
  <text start="514.07" dur="5.88">know they fund the Islamic state we know</text>
  <text start="516.919" dur="6.691">we they help train the Islamic state but</text>
  <text start="519.95" dur="6.57">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="523.61" dur="5.01">having false flags using the PKK they</text>
  <text start="526.52" dur="5.79">can&amp;#39;t get traction they&amp;#39;re using the</text>
  <text start="528.62" dur="7.86">Islamic state and we can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="532.31" dur="7.5">doing this in a very short time span to</text>
  <text start="536.48" dur="7.64">kind of blur the lines that this is kind</text>
  <text start="539.81" dur="8.49">of one in the same and we see that</text>
  <text start="544.12" dur="8.29">turkey their main goal is to get into</text>
  <text start="548.3" dur="6.86">Syria to start a war they want everyone</text>
  <text start="552.41" dur="6.63">to realize that they&amp;#39;re being attacked</text>
  <text start="555.16" dur="8.47">by the PKK by the Islamic state and they</text>
  <text start="559.04" dur="7.65">have the right to go into Syria and to</text>
  <text start="563.63" dur="5.42">push a war now you can see turkey is</text>
  <text start="566.69" dur="6.93">cracking down on the Kurdish people</text>
  <text start="569.05" dur="8.979">inside of Turkey and we see right now</text>
  <text start="573.62" dur="7.53">that every part of Turkey is on alert</text>
