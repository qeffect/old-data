  <text start="32.879" dur="4.051">the title this episode is in the dark of</text>
  <text start="35.489" dur="3.411">the night the government prepares for</text>
  <text start="36.93" dur="5.01">the economic collapse and as we know</text>
  <text start="38.9" dur="6.1">President Obama has been giving speeches</text>
  <text start="41.94" dur="4.649">on the bankruptcy of Detroit he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="45" dur="4.11">talking about Zimmerman it could have</text>
  <text start="46.589" dur="5.871">been him 35 years ago but there are many</text>
  <text start="49.11" dur="5.189">other things happening in the world and</text>
  <text start="52.46" dur="6.04">just like in the great depression</text>
  <text start="54.299" dur="5.551">leading up to World War two a a lot of</text>
  <text start="58.5" dur="3.809">people didn&amp;#39;t realize what was happening</text>
  <text start="59.85" dur="4.98">they didn&amp;#39;t realize that all these</text>
  <text start="62.309" dur="7.92">countries and everyone was maneuvering</text>
  <text start="64.83" dur="8.52">for the war that was coming and the same</text>
  <text start="70.229" dur="6.331">thing is happening right now everyone is</text>
  <text start="73.35" dur="7.259">moving assets everyone is positioning</text>
  <text start="76.56" dur="7.229">themselves and this is all for the</text>
  <text start="80.609" dur="6.93">eventual war plus the government is</text>
  <text start="83.789" dur="5.281">preparing for this collapse and the</text>
  <text start="87.539" dur="6.031">first part of this collapse will be</text>
  <text start="89.07" dur="7.289">coming around this fall there was an</text>
  <text start="93.57" dur="6.6">article that came out that believes that</text>
  <text start="96.359" dur="8.851">the Fed will do some type of tapering or</text>
  <text start="100.17" dur="7.979">some type of cutbacks and we&amp;#39;ll discuss</text>
  <text start="105.21" dur="6.509">that at the end of this report but right</text>
  <text start="108.149" dur="5.521">now let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="111.719" dur="4.14">news and as we know Detroit you know</text>
  <text start="113.67" dur="4.29">file bankruptcy and we knew this was</text>
  <text start="115.859" dur="6.15">coming this is not a surprise i reported</text>
  <text start="117.96" dur="5.969">this on a couple episodes back where the</text>
  <text start="122.009" dur="4.53">new person who was heading up and</text>
  <text start="123.929" dur="6">overseeing detroit all the financial</text>
  <text start="126.539" dur="4.951">matters you know he always said that he</text>
  <text start="129.929" dur="4.111">was going to try not to declare</text>
  <text start="131.49" dur="4.469">bankruptcy but again always when these</text>
  <text start="134.04" dur="3.96">people say this is always the opposite</text>
  <text start="135.959" dur="4.071">and they eventually went into bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="138" dur="3.98">because when you have so much debt</text>
  <text start="140.03" dur="5.61">and you can&amp;#39;t pay bills you can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="141.98" dur="6.96">things but you have no no no choice but</text>
  <text start="145.64" dur="4.89">to do this but we sing other cities that</text>
  <text start="148.94" dur="4.58">are having the same type of problems</text>
  <text start="150.53" dur="8.789">like Chicago Moody&amp;#39;s recently just</text>
  <text start="153.52" dur="8.439">downgraded their ratings and and what it</text>
  <text start="159.319" dur="4.371">says here Chicago had its bond rating</text>
  <text start="161.959" dur="4.5">downgraded by Moody&amp;#39;s Investor Services</text>
  <text start="163.69" dur="4.42">so you know we&amp;#39;re going to see this</text>
  <text start="166.459" dur="4.651">throughout the cities and this is why I</text>
  <text start="168.11" dur="7.409">said this in my past episodes Chicago</text>
  <text start="171.11" dur="7.53">New York I mean I say Illinois New York</text>
  <text start="175.519" dur="9.021">California Colorado Connecticut New</text>
  <text start="178.64" dur="12.24">Jersey Maryland these huge population</text>
  <text start="184.54" dur="8.77">populated areas with big cities are in a</text>
  <text start="190.88" dur="5.28">lot of debt right now and they are</text>
  <text start="193.31" dur="5.28">struggling just like Detroit and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="196.16" dur="5.52">on the verge of collapse also and this</text>
  <text start="198.59" dur="6.179">is why you see in the major cities these</text>
  <text start="201.68" dur="6.36">mayor&amp;#39;s creating these draconian laws</text>
  <text start="204.769" dur="5.581">these gun bill laws the like a New York</text>
  <text start="208.04" dur="5.07">City they stopped and we don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="210.35" dur="5.609">ask any permission to frisk you type of</text>
  <text start="213.11" dur="4.83">law and you know report on your neighbor</text>
  <text start="215.959" dur="5.191">will give you five hundred dollars and</text>
  <text start="217.94" dur="5.43">will research if they have a legal or</text>
  <text start="221.15" dur="4.32">illegal gun all these things are done</text>
  <text start="223.37" dur="6.48">because they&amp;#39;re in high populated areas</text>
  <text start="225.47" dur="6.75">and they know what is coming they they</text>
  <text start="229.85" dur="3.75">know their they know what&amp;#39;s going on but</text>
  <text start="232.22" dur="4.28">again they&amp;#39;re not reporting it to the</text>
  <text start="233.6" dur="6.69">public that&amp;#39;s the only difference now</text>
  <text start="236.5" dur="8.65">there was a push to push glass-steagall</text>
  <text start="240.29" dur="9.539">and reinstate it because it was repealed</text>
  <text start="245.15" dur="7.92">in 1999 and this is what caused all of</text>
  <text start="249.829" dur="9.321">these problems that banks were allowed</text>
  <text start="253.07" dur="10.11">to speculate and two combined people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="259.15" dur="7.329">deposits and invest them in things like</text>
  <text start="263.18" dur="8.1">the subprime mortgage-backed securities</text>
  <text start="266.479" dur="7.331">and they were trying to reinstate it but</text>
  <text start="271.28" dur="6.82">the banks are too powerful</text>
  <text start="273.81" dur="9.54">the Fed is too powerful and it it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="278.1" dur="7.05">go anywhere so we&amp;#39;re on a train to</text>
  <text start="283.35" dur="3.39">nowhere right now and we&amp;#39;re just going</text>
  <text start="285.15" dur="3.75">to fall off the cliff because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="286.74" dur="6.149">nothing stopping this that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="288.9" dur="5.28">what&amp;#39;s happening now Obama to Detroit I</text>
  <text start="292.889" dur="4.261">mean there were a couple congressman</text>
  <text start="294.18" dur="4.41">saying you need to help and I know Obama</text>
  <text start="297.15" dur="4.73">came out and said you know we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="298.59" dur="7.2">going to let Detroit go into bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="301.88" dur="6.52">but I don&amp;#39;t think he you know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="305.79" dur="4.29">lot of words there but again I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="308.4" dur="5.76">care what these people say I look at</text>
  <text start="310.08" dur="5.94">their actions and you can always tell</text>
  <text start="314.16" dur="3.63">the true nature of a person by their</text>
  <text start="316.02" dur="3.47">actions and not what they say because a</text>
  <text start="317.79" dur="5.16">lot of people say a lot of things and</text>
  <text start="319.49" dur="7.96">Obama likes to talk a lot and there was</text>
  <text start="322.95" dur="8.88">no way that he can bail this out the</text>
  <text start="327.45" dur="7.83">United States is in so much debt and you</text>
  <text start="331.83" dur="5.01">know because of the sequester and he</text>
  <text start="335.28" dur="3.6">keeps telling people you know came and</text>
  <text start="336.84" dur="3.99">fireworks because the sequester we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="338.88" dur="4.2">do this because of the sequester how is</text>
  <text start="340.83" dur="5.7">he going to make the case to bail out</text>
  <text start="343.08" dur="5.55">Detroit at this point plus the United</text>
  <text start="346.53" dur="5.28">States government is exactly like</text>
  <text start="348.63" dur="5.37">Detroit they have so much debt the tax</text>
  <text start="351.81" dur="6.03">revenues aren&amp;#39;t covering the interest</text>
  <text start="354" dur="6.39">payments of the national debt they are</text>
  <text start="357.84" dur="7.23">barely scraping by they&amp;#39;re coming up</text>
  <text start="360.39" dur="7.19">with new tax laws to track down where</text>
  <text start="365.07" dur="6.599">everyone has their money so they can</text>
  <text start="367.58" dur="7.78">generate more revenue and this is the</text>
  <text start="371.669" dur="8.101">last attempt of a dying government this</text>
  <text start="375.36" dur="8.21">is what happens and right now Detroit</text>
  <text start="379.77" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s done its bankrupt and you know</text>
  <text start="383.57" dur="4.27">there&amp;#39;s nothing that the u.s. government</text>
  <text start="385.65" dur="4.2">at this point can do I mean of course</text>
  <text start="387.84" dur="4.62">they can always say you know what will</text>
  <text start="389.85" dur="3.75">print more money out of thin air I mean</text>
  <text start="392.46" dur="2.97">the Fed will print more money out of</text>
  <text start="393.6" dur="3.27">thin air the loan it to the government</text>
  <text start="395.43" dur="3.75">and they can always give that money to</text>
  <text start="396.87" dur="5.31">Detroit but how long do you think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="399.18" dur="4.47">going to last again without the income</text>
  <text start="402.18" dur="4.65">without the jobs without the</text>
  <text start="403.65" dur="4.02">manufacturing just like Greece just like</text>
  <text start="406.83" dur="5.67">Cyprus</text>
  <text start="407.67" dur="6.81">debt upon debt upon debt upon debt yeah</text>
  <text start="412.5" dur="3.81">you might be able to kick the can down</text>
  <text start="414.48" dur="6.12">the street a little bit longer but you</text>
  <text start="416.31" dur="9.15">end up in the same place and I put on</text>
  <text start="420.6" dur="8.4">the x 22 report com site a little graph</text>
  <text start="425.46" dur="6.24">and this is from zero hedge of it pretty</text>
  <text start="429" dur="5.55">much sums up all the problems of Detroit</text>
  <text start="431.7" dur="4.74">and if you look at this back in nineteen</text>
  <text start="434.55" dur="5.81">fifty the population was like 1.8</text>
  <text start="436.44" dur="7.71">million in 2011 it was around 700,000</text>
  <text start="440.36" dur="7.66">manufacturing jobs back in the 50s was</text>
  <text start="444.15" dur="9.39">roughly around 300,000 and now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="448.02" dur="9.06">around 27,000 so you know we can see</text>
  <text start="453.54" dur="6.78">when you pile debt upon debt upon debt</text>
  <text start="457.08" dur="6.09">and you have no jobs you have no</text>
  <text start="460.32" dur="7.92">manufacturing you have no people living</text>
  <text start="463.17" dur="6.57">there it you you go one thing can only</text>
  <text start="468.24" dur="2.79">turn out of this is and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="469.74" dur="4.77">bankruptcy and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="471.03" dur="8.12">now these are the 12 things that will</text>
  <text start="474.51" dur="4.64">happen next in the Detroit bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="479.96" dur="5.17">alice batch elder a chief judge of the</text>
  <text start="483.15" dur="3.99">u.s. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals will</text>
  <text start="485.13" dur="4.65">point a bankruptcy judge oversee the</text>
  <text start="487.14" dur="4.8">city&amp;#39;s case the bankruptcy judge will</text>
  <text start="489.78" dur="3.87">determine where to hold hearings which</text>
  <text start="491.94" dur="4.44">could take place in Detroit Kentucky</text>
  <text start="493.65" dur="4.53">high or Tennessee an automatic stay will</text>
  <text start="496.38" dur="4.32">be issued on most of Detroit&amp;#39;s bills</text>
  <text start="498.18" dur="4.14">including unsecured debts the city will</text>
  <text start="500.7" dur="3.48">continue to pay secured creditors</text>
  <text start="502.32" dur="4.32">including water and sewer bond holders</text>
  <text start="504.18" dur="5.61">who have the right to see city assets if</text>
  <text start="506.64" dur="5.79">Detroit fails to pay an automatic stay</text>
  <text start="509.79" dur="4.41">also will be issued on lawsuits against</text>
  <text start="512.43" dur="4.59">the city including outside challenges by</text>
  <text start="514.2" dur="4.89">pension officials and union members the</text>
  <text start="517.02" dur="3.72">city doesn&amp;#39;t need approval to continue</text>
  <text start="519.09" dur="3.21">services for example the police fire</text>
  <text start="520.74" dur="4.14">water store and Public Works are</text>
  <text start="522.3" dur="5.82">completely unaffected by the bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="524.88" dur="5.7">filing for now and will operate as usual</text>
  <text start="528.12" dur="5.22">however cuts are possible in the future</text>
  <text start="530.58" dur="5.79">and when they say possible you know</text>
  <text start="533.34" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s coming creditors likely can</text>
  <text start="536.37" dur="3.81">challenge the city&amp;#39;s right to file</text>
  <text start="538.02" dur="3.18">bankruptcy by issuing motions to dismiss</text>
  <text start="540.18" dur="2.97">the case</text>
  <text start="541.2" dur="3.69">in this case bondholders and pension</text>
  <text start="543.15" dur="4.95">officials could accuse the city of</text>
  <text start="544.89" dur="5.07">failing to negotiate in good faith one</text>
  <text start="548.1" dur="4.41">of the key criteria allowing the city to</text>
  <text start="549.96" dur="5.19">file for bankruptcy the city also will</text>
  <text start="552.51" dur="4.59">have to prove it is insolvent another</text>
  <text start="555.15" dur="4.2">stipulation required to file for chapter</text>
  <text start="557.1" dur="4.59">9 bankruptcy according to the Federal</text>
  <text start="559.35" dur="4.41">Bankruptcy Code this requires the city</text>
  <text start="561.69" dur="5.22">to prove that it is not paying its bills</text>
  <text start="563.76" dur="5.07">if the judge authorizes the city to move</text>
  <text start="566.91" dur="5.1">forward with chapter 9 bankruptcy case</text>
  <text start="568.83" dur="5.4">or would propose a plan of</text>
  <text start="572.01" dur="5.52">reorganization this could take weeks</text>
  <text start="574.23" dur="6.6">months or years all depending on how</text>
  <text start="577.53" dur="5.19">everything goes the city will attempt to</text>
  <text start="580.83" dur="4.38">win support for the reorganization plan</text>
  <text start="582.72" dur="5.16">from creditors including secured bond</text>
  <text start="585.21" dur="6.42">holders general obligation bond holders</text>
  <text start="587.88" dur="6.27">unions and pension boards so that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="591.63" dur="5.94">is going to happen with the city of</text>
  <text start="594.15" dur="5.58">Detroit all right let&amp;#39;s move on here now</text>
  <text start="597.57" dur="4.25">like I said there are many things that</text>
  <text start="599.73" dur="7.83">are happening around the world</text>
  <text start="601.82" dur="8.62">especially in Syria Egypt Europe and</text>
  <text start="607.56" dur="5.46">right here the first US land-based</text>
  <text start="610.44" dur="6.06">ballistic missile defense base in Europe</text>
  <text start="613.02" dur="6.09">is to be constructed in romania by KBR</text>
  <text start="616.5" dur="4.62">and the construction contract to build a</text>
  <text start="619.11" dur="4.56">facility at Romania is I&amp;#39;m going to try</text>
  <text start="621.12" dur="5.34">to pronounce this devis aloo Air Base</text>
  <text start="623.67" dur="4.47">was issued to the Texas headquartered</text>
  <text start="626.46" dur="4.94">company by the US Army Corps of</text>
  <text start="628.14" dur="6.9">Engineers Europe district and is worth</text>
  <text start="631.4" dur="8.25">134 million dollars so we see already</text>
  <text start="635.04" dur="9.84">that that missile bases are being</text>
  <text start="639.65" dur="10.89">established in Romania which is right</text>
  <text start="644.88" dur="10.11">around the area of right next to Russia</text>
  <text start="650.54" dur="11.34">the Ukraine and this is another key area</text>
  <text start="654.99" dur="12.3">now Russia is looking to move into</text>
  <text start="661.88" dur="8.44">Cyprus air and naval bases and what</text>
  <text start="667.29" dur="5.78">they&amp;#39;re looking to do here is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="670.32" dur="2.75">looking to</text>
  <text start="674.19" dur="9.12">put their ships and their Air Force in</text>
  <text start="679.89" dur="5.94">Cyprus and this agreement would mark a</text>
  <text start="683.31" dur="5.13">serious escalation of Russian</text>
  <text start="685.83" dur="4.53">capabilities in the Mediterranean as the</text>
  <text start="688.44" dur="4.23">basis would serve as a launching ground</text>
  <text start="690.36" dur="5.75">for russian air and naval missions</text>
  <text start="692.67" dur="7.67">throughout the region so we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="696.11" dur="7.39">different things occur in these areas</text>
  <text start="700.34" dur="6.82">around the mediterranean around syria</text>
  <text start="703.5" dur="7.4">around Iran around China everything is</text>
  <text start="707.16" dur="5.97">being put into place now over in Egypt</text>

  <text start="713.13" dur="5.76">rioting Morsi supporters are holding</text>
  <text start="715.5" dur="4.77">fresh rallies across Egypt tens of</text>

  <text start="723.18" dur="10.95">fresh rallies across Egypt to demand his</text>
  <text start="725.79" dur="12.11">reinstatement now again it looks like</text>
  <text start="734.13" dur="8.19">the u.s. is trying to maintain the</text>
  <text start="737.9" dur="7.78">government in Egypt to maintain the</text>
  <text start="742.32" dur="6.87">dollar as the reserve currency and the</text>
  <text start="745.68" dur="7.02">central bank and again the US does have</text>
  <text start="749.19" dur="6.33">troops ready to go in if things get out</text>
  <text start="752.7" dur="4.37">of hand and the government the US</text>

  <text start="757.07" dur="7">approve who gets put into office right</text>

  <text start="988.529" dur="7.051">that he can and the war is not going</text>
  <text start="992.22" dur="7.44">well so here we are now how is he going</text>
  <text start="995.58" dur="8.54">to get these troops into Syria well one</text>
  <text start="999.66" dur="7.76">way is a false flag event you know kill</text>
  <text start="1004.12" dur="7.57">Americans make it bloody horrific and</text>
  <text start="1007.42" dur="6.19">prove his point the the administration</text>
  <text start="1011.69" dur="3.81">could prove their point of see this is</text>
  <text start="1013.61" dur="3.419">why we have to go in there and the</text>
  <text start="1015.5" dur="3.69">American and Congress will beg for it</text>

  <text start="1042.1" dur="5.5">tell the troops to go in and he can make</text>
  <text start="1045.439" dur="5.221">this up as you know this is not a war</text>
  <text start="1047.6" dur="6.09">this is just a temporary thing and which</text>
  <text start="1050.66" dur="6.03">turns into a long-term thing and this is</text>
  <text start="1053.69" dur="5.4">how they avoid all the laws and the only</text>

  <text start="1083.6" dur="4.26">difficult to say which approach they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1085.73" dur="4.71">going to take but we should always be</text>
  <text start="1087.86" dur="4.62">prepared and look out for some type of</text>
  <text start="1090.44" dur="5.19">event and be aware that something could</text>
  <text start="1092.48" dur="6.48">happen but they are prepping for</text>
