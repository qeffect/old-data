  <text start="34.95" dur="5.91">episode 660 and today&amp;#39;s date is May 6</text>
  <text start="37.77" dur="5.88">2015 and the title this episode is the</text>
  <text start="40.86" dur="6.48">economic storm has reached the US and it</text>
  <text start="43.65" dur="5.37">will wreak havoc on the world let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="47.34" dur="2.91">right into the economic collapse news</text>
  <text start="49.02" dur="3.21">now we&amp;#39;re going to head right out to</text>
  <text start="50.25" dur="4.44">Greece because the situation there is</text>
  <text start="52.23" dur="6.95">getting worse day by day and we see the</text>
  <text start="54.69" dur="6.45">two institutions the IMF and the EU</text>
  <text start="59.18" dur="5.379">basically they&amp;#39;re obstructing</text>
  <text start="61.14" dur="5.49">negotiations with Greece the main</text>
  <text start="64.559" dur="4.771">argument of the institutions for not</text>
  <text start="66.63" dur="4.08">securing a deal was that the Greek side</text>
  <text start="69.33" dur="4.26">had not submitted comprehensive</text>
  <text start="70.71" dur="5.69">proposals now it becomes apparent that</text>
  <text start="73.59" dur="5.13">the proposals have been submitted and</text>
  <text start="76.4" dur="4.48">substantial concessions have made</text>
  <text start="78.72" dur="6.72">towards clinching and honest compromise</text>
  <text start="80.88" dur="7.08">but the IMO the IMF considers reforms in</text>
  <text start="85.44" dur="4.86">pensions and labour as its red lines</text>
  <text start="87.96" dur="5.25">while it is not so strict about the</text>
  <text start="90.3" dur="6.599">primary surplus the IMF is also</text>
  <text start="93.21" dur="5.81">considering a debt write-off to make it</text>
  <text start="96.899" dur="4.561">viable on the other hand the EU</text>
  <text start="99.02" dur="5.47">considers the primary surplus an</text>
  <text start="101.46" dur="5.76">important issue and is against any debt</text>
  <text start="104.49" dur="5.15">write-down while it is not so strict</text>
  <text start="107.22" dur="4.53">about reforms in labor laws and Pensions</text>
  <text start="109.64" dur="4.44">the overall result is that the</text>
  <text start="111.75" dur="4.77">institutions have red lines everywhere</text>
  <text start="114.08" dur="6.37">pensioned labor laws primary surplus</text>
  <text start="116.52" dur="8.43">with these facts there cannot be any</text>
  <text start="120.45" dur="8.88">type of compromise so right now Greece</text>
  <text start="124.95" dur="6.42">is in limbo and we see Greece is getting</text>
  <text start="129.33" dur="4.8">nervous they have a huge payment coming</text>
  <text start="131.37" dur="4.589">up they just paid something like 220</text>
  <text start="134.13" dur="4.95">million euros they have in something</text>
  <text start="135.959" dur="5.911">like 700 million euros coming up and it</text>
  <text start="139.08" dur="5.4">seems like they&amp;#39;re implementing a form</text>
  <text start="141.87" dur="4.229">of capital controls on the people Greece</text>
  <text start="144.48" dur="5.31">has revealed it will introduce a</text>
  <text start="146.099" dur="6.061">surcharge for all cash point withdrawals</text>
  <text start="149.79" dur="5.49">and financial transactions in a</text>
  <text start="152.16" dur="5.73">desperate attempt to raise funds they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="155.28" dur="4.65">hoping by doing this they will stop the</text>
  <text start="157.89" dur="4.409">people from withdrawing their money from</text>
  <text start="159.93" dur="3.99">the bank and they&amp;#39;re hoping to raise</text>
  <text start="162.299" dur="3.27">from these fees</text>
  <text start="163.92" dur="5.22">about a hundred and eighty million</text>
  <text start="165.569" dur="8.361">dollar euros the penalty will be about</text>
  <text start="169.14" dur="7.5">one euro for every 1000 euros transacted</text>
  <text start="173.93" dur="4.75">while the measure is unlikely to impact</text>
  <text start="176.64" dur="4.26">on a day-to-day withdrawals Greece hopes</text>
  <text start="178.68" dur="5.309">it will deter citizens clearing out</text>
  <text start="180.9" dur="6.98">their bank accounts so we can see</text>
  <text start="183.989" dur="7.711">already they need this money to stay in</text>
  <text start="187.88" dur="5.829">the banks they can&amp;#39;t have it being taken</text>
  <text start="191.7" dur="3.84">out and we know a lot of the Greek</text>
  <text start="193.709" dur="3.091">people are very nervous the pensioners</text>
  <text start="195.54" dur="3.66">are very nervous are coming in they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="196.8" dur="4.35">taking their money a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="199.2" dur="3.33">withdrawing their money because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="201.15" dur="5.1">nervous about what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="202.53" dur="5.789">they don&amp;#39;t want to be Cyprus basically</text>
  <text start="206.25" dur="3.36">what that is is one day the Cyprus</text>
  <text start="208.319" dur="2.821">people want to sleep on a Friday</text>
  <text start="209.61" dur="4.74">Saturday woke up and guess what the</text>
  <text start="211.14" dur="4.71">banks were shut down and the government</text>
  <text start="214.35" dur="4.38">the central banker said listen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="215.85" dur="4.41">going to take your money and you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="218.73" dur="3.45">take your money out and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="220.26" dur="5.58">implement capital controls it will be</text>
  <text start="222.18" dur="6">stuck in there for over a year and will</text>
  <text start="225.84" dur="4.38">replace your money with worthless bank</text>
  <text start="228.18" dur="3.929">stock and of course they told them it</text>
  <text start="230.22" dur="4.29">was going to be eight ten percent and it</text>
  <text start="232.109" dur="6.301">went all the way up to forty seven</text>
  <text start="234.51" dur="7.08">percent now we understand the economies</text>
  <text start="238.41" dur="6.27">around the world they&amp;#39;re not doing well</text>
  <text start="241.59" dur="5.76">Europe is not doing well we see signs in</text>
  <text start="244.68" dur="6">the UK we see it in Germany Canada</text>
  <text start="247.35" dur="7.229">Australia yes here in the US but the</text>
  <text start="250.68" dur="6.51">eurozone their retail sales were weaker</text>
  <text start="254.579" dur="4.231">than expected in March data showed on</text>
  <text start="257.19" dur="3.66">Wednesday turning negative on a monthly</text>
  <text start="258.81" dur="4.95">basis for the first time since last</text>

  <text start="263.76" dur="4.5">office eurostat said retail sales in the</text>
  <text start="265.71" dur="6.54">nineteen countries sharing the euro fell</text>
  <text start="268.26" dur="7.2">by point eight percent month on month so</text>
  <text start="272.25" dur="5.64">it shows us that things are really</text>
  <text start="275.46" dur="5.61">starting to slow up things are starting</text>
  <text start="277.89" dur="7.11">to fall apart and here in the United</text>
  <text start="281.07" dur="7.89">States what do we see we see that every</text>
  <text start="285" dur="8.4">day more and more information comes out</text>
  <text start="288.96" dur="7.29">to show us that the economy is not doing</text>
  <text start="293.4" dur="4.02">well and we can see right now US</text>
  <text start="296.25" dur="6.45">economic confidence</text>
  <text start="297.42" dur="7.83">has just crashed most since July despite</text>
  <text start="302.7" dur="4.86">record stock prices and all the weather</text>
  <text start="305.25" dur="5.19">excuses for the current economic</text>
  <text start="307.56" dur="4.56">weakness the Fed promising that growth</text>
  <text start="310.44" dur="3.6">is here and everything is rosy and</text>
  <text start="312.12" dur="4.89">everything is fine and everything is</text>
  <text start="314.04" dur="6.36">going as planned Gallup&amp;#39;s US economic</text>
  <text start="317.01" dur="5.91">confidence index plunged by nine points</text>
  <text start="320.4" dur="7.77">last week the largest weak weak drop</text>
  <text start="322.92" dur="9.36">since last July and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="328.17" dur="8.51">is that the main driver was a collapse</text>
  <text start="332.28" dur="8.64">of hope as outlook fell to November lows</text>
  <text start="336.68" dur="7.12">people are looking at what is going on</text>
  <text start="340.92" dur="6.63">they see their strip malls becoming</text>
  <text start="343.8" dur="5.16">empty stores closing in the malls they</text>
  <text start="347.55" dur="2.61">see that they&amp;#39;re putting their house up</text>
  <text start="348.96" dur="3.84">for sale is getting more and more</text>
  <text start="350.16" dur="6">difficult to sell their home they see</text>
  <text start="352.8" dur="5.82">that my job is in jeopardy I might be</text>
  <text start="356.16" dur="5.07">the next one laid off because two of my</text>
  <text start="358.62" dur="5.13">co-workers were just laid off and</text>
  <text start="361.23" dur="6.75">they&amp;#39;re reporting back to me saying I</text>
  <text start="363.75" dur="5.82">cannot find the same job it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="367.98" dur="4.41">more and more difficult I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="369.57" dur="4.2">understand this unemployment the</text>
  <text start="372.39" dur="2.82">government is telling us the central</text>
  <text start="373.77" dur="6.29">bankers are telling us it&amp;#39;s at five and</text>
  <text start="375.21" dur="8.85">a half percent but I can&amp;#39;t find work and</text>
  <text start="380.06" dur="6.63">we can see that people are starting to</text>
  <text start="384.06" dur="9.03">realize something is going on here and</text>
  <text start="386.69" dur="9.85">it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense ADP just reported</text>
  <text start="393.09" dur="6.42">their employment report and this is the</text>
  <text start="396.54" dur="5.55">biggest miss in four years and missing</text>
  <text start="399.51" dur="6.69">for three straight months April printed</text>
  <text start="402.09" dur="8.79">a very weak 190 169,000 jobs when they</text>
  <text start="406.2" dur="7.05">were expecting it to be over 200 even</text>
  <text start="410.88" dur="5.55">worse februari and March was revised</text>
  <text start="413.25" dur="6.78">even lower this is the low this is the</text>
  <text start="416.43" dur="6.57">lowest that we&amp;#39;ve seen for a long time</text>
  <text start="420.03" dur="5.76">Manufacturing&amp;#39;s manufacturing jobs lost</text>
  <text start="423" dur="6.39">about 10,000 jobs in April and the</text>
  <text start="425.79" dur="4.26">goods-producing sector lost about 8,000</text>
  <text start="429.39" dur="3.239">jobs</text>
  <text start="430.05" dur="6.269">and we can see right now we are in a</text>
  <text start="432.629" dur="7.021">downward trend if we go back to November</text>
  <text start="436.319" dur="6.78">of 2014 we see their numbers came in at</text>
  <text start="439.65" dur="9.72">284 December of 2014 the number came</text>

  <text start="451.259" dur="5.37">people just couldn&amp;#39;t get out there to</text>
  <text start="452.699" dur="8.911">get those jobs March 175 and here we are</text>
  <text start="456.629" dur="8.01">in April at 169 it is a downward trend</text>
  <text start="461.61" dur="5.94">it is getting harder and harder for</text>
  <text start="464.639" dur="6.93">people to find good jobs and more and</text>
  <text start="467.55" dur="7.459">more people are being laid off and we</text>
  <text start="471.569" dur="7.861">understand while this is happening</text>
  <text start="475.009" dur="7.601">retail sales are plummeting how sales</text>
  <text start="479.43" dur="5.85">are going nowhere as the interest rates</text>
  <text start="482.61" dur="6.75">tick up a little bit it knocks more and</text>
  <text start="485.28" dur="6.65">more people out of out of the area where</text>
  <text start="489.36" dur="5.94">they can afford to purchase a house and</text>
  <text start="491.93" dur="8.049">when this happens we see mortgage</text>
  <text start="495.3" dur="6.929">applications they dip down and as of the</text>
  <text start="499.979" dur="4.861">week of May first mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="502.229" dur="4.261">dropped another four point six percent</text>

  <text start="524.51" dur="6.88">it&amp;#39;s very difficult and the government</text>
  <text start="528.12" dur="5.88">right now is using the subprime</text>
  <text start="531.39" dur="5.069">mortgages to pump up the housing</text>
  <text start="534" dur="5.04">recovery I mean it seems hard to believe</text>
  <text start="536.459" dur="5.701">but the government is purposely</text>
  <text start="539.04" dur="5.6">recreating the mortgage debacle of 2007</text>
  <text start="542.16" dur="7.94">and we discussed as many times and</text>
  <text start="544.64" dur="9.52">basically what it&amp;#39;s doing its luring the</text>

  <text start="589.88" dur="5.92">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the government</text>
  <text start="593.61" dur="5.19">right now with Freddie and Fannie they</text>
  <text start="595.8" dur="6.33">implemented these new programs that</text>

  <text start="1714.36" dur="4.53">don&amp;#39;t like to they will try to use force</text>
  <text start="1717.45" dur="2.96">against the people and this is what</text>
  <text start="1718.89" dur="5.28">always happens throughout history and</text>
  <text start="1720.41" dur="6.76">every time they use force they will be</text>
  <text start="1724.17" dur="6.12">on the losing side because the people</text>

  <text start="1738.21" dur="8.21">outnumber the government and we can see</text>
  <text start="1742.95" dur="6.24">at this point we&amp;#39;re at a crossroads now</text>
  <text start="1746.42" dur="5.2">do we want to continue with the system</text>
  <text start="1749.19" dur="5.67">or is it time for us to say you know</text>
  <text start="1751.62" dur="6.96">what enough&amp;#39;s enough it is time for us</text>
  <text start="1754.86" dur="6.39">to speak out it is time for us to gather</text>

  <text start="1770.94" dur="8.55">coming there will be a moment in time</text>
  <text start="1773.49" dur="12.24">where we will be able to do this now out</text>
  <text start="1779.49" dur="8.52">in Ukraine we understand the US</text>

  <text start="2494.4" dur="9.24">it was a landslide vote he&amp;#39;s in power</text>
  <text start="2500.37" dur="5.64">and the only group in Syria that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="2503.64" dur="8.13">using chlorine gas is the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="2506.01" dur="10.22">is the Free Syrian Army the rebels that</text>
  <text start="2511.77" dur="9.51">the United States trains and we can see</text>

  <text start="2534.72" dur="5.4">they want the protection from the United</text>
  <text start="2536.31" dur="6.84">States and right now NATO is going to</text>
  <text start="2540.12" dur="6.66">attempt an interim government in these</text>

  <text start="2546.78" dur="6.39">try to force the country away from Assad</text>
  <text start="2550.65" dur="5.28">so they could say ah this portion of the</text>
  <text start="2553.17" dur="5.49">country is no longer part of Syria which</text>
  <text start="2555.93" dur="3.58">means we can establish a US base there</text>

  <text start="2559.51" dur="6.36">means NATO can come in which means we</text>
