  <text start="203.58" dur="5.31">right now and we&amp;#39;ve said this for quite</text>
  <text start="205.86" dur="6.15">a while right now what Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="208.89" dur="5.46">and the Patriots they are building up</text>
  <text start="212.01" dur="3.66">the economy to make it look like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="214.35" dur="5.43">better than ever I mean if we look at</text>
  <text start="215.67" dur="6.99">the latest Gallup polls America right</text>
  <text start="219.78" dur="6.51">now believes that the economic</text>
  <text start="222.66" dur="5.45">conditions are pretty darn good they</text>
  <text start="226.29" dur="5.37">feel that everything is a lot better</text>
  <text start="228.11" dur="6.79">people are doing better and Trump has</text>
  <text start="231.66" dur="6.2">taken us out of this slump and has</text>
  <text start="234.9" dur="8.52">brought the economy back now once again</text>
  <text start="237.86" dur="8.02">we know that this is an illusion Trump</text>
  <text start="243.42" dur="4.59">is using the tools the central bankers</text>
  <text start="245.88" dur="5.13">the deeps they put into place and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="248.01" dur="5.58">using it to the nth degree this is all</text>
  <text start="251.01" dur="7.289">part of the plan he needs the American</text>
  <text start="253.59" dur="7.38">people to believe and understand that</text>
  <text start="258.299" dur="7.651">the economy is doing well he needs them</text>
  <text start="260.97" dur="9.96">to feel it why well because when it</text>
  <text start="265.95" dur="8.03">comes down he needs everyone to say well</text>
  <text start="270.93" dur="7.05">the economy was doing really really well</text>
  <text start="273.98" dur="7.35">why did it crash who&amp;#39;s responsible and</text>
  <text start="277.98" dur="6.45">we never want this to happen again</text>
  <text start="281.33" dur="4.15">that&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s doing this I mean a lot</text>
  <text start="284.43" dur="3">of people don&amp;#39;t understand they think</text>
  <text start="285.48" dur="4.38">like oh he&amp;#39;s out there and he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="287.43" dur="4.32">the same thing Obama did and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="289.86" dur="3.98">down the same exact path well if that is</text>
  <text start="291.75" dur="4.65">the case we&amp;#39;re in really big trouble</text>
  <text start="293.84" dur="4.12">because with the deep state with the</text>
  <text start="296.4" dur="2.25">central bank were pretty much back to</text>
  <text start="297.96" dur="3.47">where we were</text>
  <text start="298.65" dur="5.79">we&amp;#39;ll be going off to war everything is</text>
  <text start="301.43" dur="6.13">the way it was before nothing&amp;#39;s changed</text>
  <text start="304.44" dur="5.28">but we don&amp;#39;t see that we see Trump out</text>
  <text start="307.56" dur="4.65">there and as he&amp;#39;s getting more power</text>
  <text start="309.72" dur="4.32">more comfortable getting rid of the</text>
  <text start="312.21" dur="4.05">leaks getting rid of those people that</text>
  <text start="314.04" dur="3.93">oppose him you can tell he&amp;#39;s coming up</text>
  <text start="316.26" dur="3.39">with statements saying you know</text>
  <text start="317.97" dur="2.13">something we&amp;#39;re getting rid of the</text>
  <text start="319.65" dur="2.37">global</text>
  <text start="320.1" dur="4.38">power we&amp;#39;re getting rid of the globalist</text>
  <text start="322.02" dur="4.56">trade deal the biggest threat is the Fed</text>
  <text start="324.48" dur="5.31">I&amp;#39;m gonna come out and contradict the</text>
  <text start="326.58" dur="5.07">Fed and it continually does this and he</text>
  <text start="329.79" dur="4.28">continually comes out and says more and</text>
  <text start="331.65" dur="5.19">more and more now again the central bank</text>
  <text start="334.07" dur="4.63">they don&amp;#39;t want to be removed they want</text>
  <text start="336.84" dur="5.13">control they&amp;#39;ve always wanted the</text>
  <text start="338.7" dur="5.28">control and if any president or anyone</text>
  <text start="341.97" dur="5.34">comes up against the central bank they</text>
  <text start="343.98" dur="5.31">normally do something and that is to get</text>
  <text start="347.31" dur="2.76">rid of those people that are trying to</text>
  <text start="349.29" dur="4.38">take them down</text>
  <text start="350.07" dur="7.17">he knows this he knows fully well what</text>
  <text start="353.67" dur="7.11">he is doing with others behind him they</text>
  <text start="357.24" dur="5.58">know how risky it is but this plan has</text>
  <text start="360.78" dur="4.47">been in place for a very long time to</text>
  <text start="362.82" dur="4.8">bring down the other to bring down the</text>
  <text start="365.25" dur="3.21">central bank system and it&amp;#39;s not an easy</text>
  <text start="367.62" dur="2.55">job</text>
  <text start="368.46" dur="3.72">you just can&amp;#39;t flip a switch and say</text>
  <text start="370.17" dur="4.29">you&amp;#39;re done with the central bank just</text>
  <text start="372.18" dur="4.41">doesn&amp;#39;t go away they&amp;#39;ve been around for</text>
  <text start="374.46" dur="4.41">a very long time and they always seem to</text>
  <text start="376.59" dur="4.71">slither their way back into power</text>
  <text start="378.87" dur="5.1">somehow some way when they see that</text>
  <text start="381.3" dur="4.86">people forget or the timing is just</text>
  <text start="383.97" dur="4.16">right and people don&amp;#39;t notice this and</text>
  <text start="386.16" dur="6.81">they are able to pay off certain people</text>
  <text start="388.13" dur="6.94">but if we go back in time we can see if</text>
  <text start="392.97" dur="4.35">we go back to 2015 when Trump was a</text>
  <text start="395.07" dur="5.31">candidate he said something very</text>
  <text start="397.32" dur="6.3">interesting he said it&amp;#39;s a false economy</text>
  <text start="400.38" dur="6.69">that we&amp;#39;re living in were in a bubble</text>
  <text start="403.62" dur="6.33">now the person who said this was Trump</text>
  <text start="407.07" dur="7.08">and he was talking about the Federal</text>
  <text start="409.95" dur="7.02">Reserve policy and back then he was a</text>
  <text start="414.15" dur="6.27">candidate so listen to what he said back</text>
  <text start="416.97" dur="5.76">in 2015 you said the system is out of</text>
  <text start="420.42" dur="4.5">whack and you do you think the economy</text>
  <text start="422.73" dur="5.67">is tilted the way a lot of Americans do</text>
  <text start="424.92" dur="6.6">that it&amp;#39;s unfair it&amp;#39;s not a question of</text>
  <text start="428.4" dur="4.71">unfair you know it&amp;#39;s a false it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="431.52" dur="3.99">false economy that will it again we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="433.11" dur="4.02">in a bubble and more importantly when</text>
  <text start="435.51" dur="2.76">you look at unemployment in this country</text>
  <text start="437.13" dur="3.96">we have close to a hundred million</text>
  <text start="438.27" dur="5.79">people that are out of work and yet we</text>
  <text start="441.09" dur="5.01">have a five in a you know 5.3 percent</text>
  <text start="444.06" dur="4.29">unemployment rate which is a total joke</text>
  <text start="446.1" dur="4.74">I think the real numbers probably into</text>
  <text start="448.35" dur="5.55">the 30s somebody actually read the other</text>
  <text start="450.84" dur="4.65">day they said it&amp;#39;s actually 42% and</text>
  <text start="453.9" dur="4.829">the real number you know when you go out</text>
  <text start="455.49" dur="6.12">there you see tremendous tremendously</text>
  <text start="458.729" dur="4.44">unhappy people and then you read oh the</text>
  <text start="461.61" dur="3.27">jobs numbers what&amp;#39;s a phony number</text>
  <text start="463.169" dur="3.931">because when you stop looking for a job</text>
  <text start="464.88" dur="3.659">you&amp;#39;re no longer in that statistic so if</text>
  <text start="467.1" dur="3.569">you&amp;#39;re looking for a job and you stop</text>
  <text start="468.539" dur="3.6">you&amp;#39;re no longer in the statistic John</text>
  <text start="470.669" dur="3.991">and then they say it&amp;#39;s a five point two</text>
  <text start="472.139" dur="4.891">five point three percent it&amp;#39;s not five</text>
  <text start="474.66" dur="4.259">point three percent it&amp;#39;s in two 2030s it</text>
  <text start="477.03" dur="4.139">could even be in the 40s and there are a</text>
  <text start="478.919" dur="4.741">lot of unhappy people out there and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="481.169" dur="4.5">just this was made up by the politicians</text>
  <text start="483.66" dur="4.47">for the politicians the accounting</text>
  <text start="485.669" dur="3.991">method so that they could look good but</text>
  <text start="488.13" dur="3.38">let me tell you something the Obama</text>
  <text start="489.66" dur="4.65">administration we have tremendous</text>
  <text start="491.51" dur="5.11">unemployment in this country and and the</text>
  <text start="494.31" dur="4.109">fact is we don&amp;#39;t make things anymore you</text>
  <text start="496.62" dur="3.45">look at what&amp;#39;s going on with China you</text>
  <text start="498.419" dur="3.631">look at what&amp;#39;s going on with Japan with</text>
  <text start="500.07" dur="3.629">the cars you look at what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="502.05" dur="3.96">with Mexico where they&amp;#39;re taking our</text>
  <text start="503.699" dur="4.5">jobs not only killing us at the border I</text>
  <text start="506.01" dur="4.23">love Mexico I have great relationships</text>
  <text start="508.199" dur="3.811">in Mexico but their leaders are much</text>
  <text start="510.24" dur="3.539">smaller than our leaders and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="512.01" dur="3.69">taking our jobs they&amp;#39;re killing us at</text>
  <text start="513.779" dur="3.841">the border as they you know everybody</text>
  <text start="515.7" dur="3.63">takes advantage of the United States</text>
  <text start="517.62" dur="3.719">because we have people that truly don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="519.33" dur="5.58">know what they&amp;#39;re doing leading us now</text>
  <text start="521.339" dur="4.831">back then when Trump was saying all of</text>
  <text start="524.91" dur="3.69">this and he was saying that you know</text>
  <text start="526.17" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s a false economy unemployment we</text>
  <text start="528.6" dur="4.83">were saying the same exact thing that</text>
  <text start="530.49" dur="6.45">these were manipulated numbers when he</text>
  <text start="533.43" dur="7.32">got into office and he started to use</text>
  <text start="536.94" dur="7.89">the same accounting methods as you know</text>
  <text start="540.75" dur="6.26">unemployment GDP the stock market a lot</text>
  <text start="544.83" dur="5.28">of people thought oh wait a minute</text>
  <text start="547.01" dur="5.38">Trump before was saying that this is</text>
  <text start="550.11" dur="4.979">fake and now he&amp;#39;s saying this is real</text>
  <text start="552.39" dur="6.24">see they&amp;#39;re misinterpreting what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="555.089" dur="5.611">actually doing and people misinterpret a</text>
  <text start="558.63" dur="3.75">lot of what he does just like with North</text>
  <text start="560.7" dur="3.99">Korea people saying that you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="562.38" dur="5.67">he&amp;#39;s trigger-happy we&amp;#39;re gonna be going</text>
  <text start="564.69" dur="4.92">to war and we don&amp;#39;t see peace in the</text>
  <text start="568.05" dur="5.36">cards whatsoever and actually the</text>
  <text start="569.61" dur="8.099">opposite happened this is how he works</text>
  <text start="573.41" dur="7.72">this is what he does he convinces</text>
  <text start="577.709" dur="7.171">everyone that he&amp;#39;s doing something else</text>
  <text start="581.13" dur="6.36">while in the background it allows him to</text>
  <text start="584.88" dur="4.56">do what he really wants to do</text>
  <text start="587.49" dur="3.719">and what the Patriots need to do and</text>
  <text start="589.44" dur="4.83">that is to get rid of the central bank</text>
  <text start="591.209" dur="6.451">and the only way to do this and remember</text>
  <text start="594.27" dur="5.939">the people need to understand and</text>
  <text start="597.66" dur="5.63">realize that it was the central bank</text>
  <text start="600.209" dur="6.781">that did this that it was that those</text>
  <text start="603.29" dur="5.35">individuals that held government that</text>
  <text start="606.99" dur="5.01">were in line with the central bank</text>
  <text start="608.64" dur="5.87">they&amp;#39;re the ones who did this so right</text>
  <text start="612" dur="5.37">now the future because that was the past</text>
  <text start="614.51" dur="4.78">well the future is proving the past</text>
  <text start="617.37" dur="4.32">because this is exactly what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="619.29" dur="4.89">and he he took Andrew Jackson and he put</text>
  <text start="621.69" dur="5.79">it on the wall on purpose that was an</text>
  <text start="624.18" dur="7.349">indicator a signal to everyone this is</text>
  <text start="627.48" dur="8.43">what I am going to do and you can see</text>
  <text start="631.529" dur="7.741">right now he needs to use everything the</text>
  <text start="635.91" dur="5.46">central bank the deep state what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="639.27" dur="4.74">been doing in the past he needs to</text>
  <text start="641.37" dur="4.5">continue this moving forward and he</text>
  <text start="644.01" dur="4.26">needs to manipulate it even further he</text>
  <text start="645.87" dur="4.95">needs to run the dead up like there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="648.27" dur="5.7">tomorrow in the meantime while everyone</text>

  <text start="667.62" dur="5.13">Fed is the biggest threat this is all</text>
  <text start="670.35" dur="3.45">part of the plan now remember it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="672.75" dur="5.55">just one plan</text>
  <text start="673.8" dur="6.12">it&amp;#39;s the umbrella of this gigantic plan</text>
  <text start="678.3" dur="3.75">because it&amp;#39;s not just a plan for the</text>
  <text start="679.92" dur="4.8">central bank a plan for the deep state a</text>

  <text start="707.88" dur="6.03">that we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and why does</text>
  <text start="711.93" dur="3.87">he have to run up the debt why does he</text>
  <text start="713.91" dur="4.77">have to manipulate these numbers because</text>
  <text start="715.8" dur="4.98">when the system comes down it has to be</text>
  <text start="718.68" dur="6.78">a big enough shock</text>
  <text start="720.78" dur="8.01">where people don&amp;#39;t look at Trump but</text>
  <text start="725.46" dur="6.86">they look at the central bank they look</text>
  <text start="728.79" dur="6.51">at who is really responsible for this</text>
  <text start="732.32" dur="6.04">now people are saying well well then he</text>
  <text start="735.3" dur="5.58">crash the system no the central bank did</text>
  <text start="738.36" dur="5.04">by raising the rates actually whose</text>
  <text start="740.88" dur="5.64">system is this this is a central banking</text>
  <text start="743.4" dur="5.04">system we we can&amp;#39;t fix a central banking</text>
  <text start="746.52" dur="5.13">system it&amp;#39;s unfixable actually it</text>
  <text start="748.44" dur="5.16">doesn&amp;#39;t even work because there&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="751.65" dur="4.02">a time frame where it completely breaks</text>
  <text start="753.6" dur="4.65">down and it implodes on itself it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="755.67" dur="4.67">designed that way and if you go back in</text>
  <text start="758.25" dur="5.22">time you can see it every single time we</text>
  <text start="760.34" dur="5.29">weren&amp;#39;t even supposed to go past 2008</text>
  <text start="763.47" dur="3.96">this is why they had to create currency</text>
  <text start="765.63" dur="3.63">like crazy this is crazy this is why</text>
  <text start="767.43" dur="4.29">they had a bailout banks</text>
  <text start="769.26" dur="5.19">this is why they had to do all these</text>
  <text start="771.72" dur="6.57">things behind the scenes to keep the</text>
  <text start="774.45" dur="5.52">system operational long enough so they</text>
  <text start="778.29" dur="4.64">could have some type of major event</text>
  <text start="779.97" dur="7.23">where it will cover everything up and</text>
  <text start="782.93" dur="7.57">you could see at this point during 2008</text>
  <text start="787.2" dur="5.64">moving forward those individuals decided</text>
  <text start="790.5" dur="5.67">at that time we were going to become</text>
  <text start="792.84" dur="5.46">very very wealthy the 1% was going to</text>
  <text start="796.17" dur="4.23">get everything before this system died</text>
  <text start="798.3" dur="4.44">and we had to restart it and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="800.4" dur="5.49">mean paper money I&amp;#39;m talking about real</text>
  <text start="802.74" dur="5.85">assets so when we look at what he said</text>
  <text start="805.89" dur="4.89">in the past he is still following the</text>
  <text start="808.59" dur="6.12">same exact plan nothing&amp;#39;s changed</text>
  <text start="810.78" dur="7.37">back then he let us know that this was a</text>
  <text start="814.71" dur="4.68">fake economy it&amp;#39;s completely fake and</text>
  <text start="818.15" dur="4.87">today</text>
  <text start="819.39" dur="7.28">he&amp;#39;s using the fake economy to push the</text>
  <text start="823.02" dur="5.79">plan forward to reset the system and</text>
  <text start="826.67" dur="4.75">when we look back in time when</text>
  <text start="828.81" dur="4.74">everything is all said and done we will</text>
  <text start="831.42" dur="4.94">be able to see this we&amp;#39;ll be able to see</text>
  <text start="833.55" dur="5.58">exactly what has happened here and</text>
  <text start="836.36" dur="5.17">people will say wow and history will</text>
  <text start="839.13" dur="4.35">look at this and say yes look at this</text>
  <text start="841.53" dur="4.95">this was a central bank economy we never</text>
  <text start="843.48" dur="6.09">won a central bank again the economy was</text>
  <text start="846.48" dur="5.1">blown up on purpose to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="849.57" dur="5.36">central bank the people turned on the</text>
  <text start="851.58" dur="6.199">central bank and the whole system was</text>
  <text start="854.93" dur="5.43">started with the people controlling who</text>
  <text start="857.779" dur="6.81">creates the currency who controls the</text>
  <text start="860.36" dur="6.69">economy now as time goes on people will</text>
  <text start="864.589" dur="5.131">start to forget I mean I won&amp;#39;t be in</text>
  <text start="867.05" dur="5.76">five years ten years most likely will be</text>
  <text start="869.72" dur="4.44">50 60 70 years they&amp;#39;ll start to forget</text>
  <text start="872.81" dur="3.81">who&amp;#39;s responsible</text>
  <text start="874.16" dur="5.67">we&amp;#39;ll have corruption once again in</text>
  <text start="876.62" dur="4.32">government and we&amp;#39;ll have the things</text>
  <text start="879.83" dur="4.44">start all over again</text>
  <text start="880.94" dur="6.93">I mean this is human nature you can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="884.27" dur="7.35">anything about it unless people tell the</text>
  <text start="887.87" dur="8.219">story every single day but we know what</text>
  <text start="891.62" dur="7.409">happens other individuals who are</text>
  <text start="896.089" dur="5.101">corrupt come into the fold and they</text>
  <text start="899.029" dur="4.741">start taking over some of the media</text>
  <text start="901.19" dur="5.1">companies start moving into government</text>
  <text start="903.77" dur="3.66">getting positions and people stop</text>
  <text start="906.29" dur="3.989">talking about it</text>
  <text start="907.43" dur="5.46">and time goes on they corrupt other</text>
  <text start="910.279" dur="4.321">people and someone says you know maybe</text>

  <text start="914.6" dur="3.33">to you know control the economy and</text>
  <text start="916.7" dur="4.95">things like that and this is how it</text>
  <text start="917.93" dur="6.21">starts or powerful people will bring</text>
  <text start="921.65" dur="4.439">down the economy and say listen you</text>
  <text start="924.14" dur="4.56">can&amp;#39;t manage the economy maybe you</text>
  <text start="926.089" dur="3.661">should have a central bank manage it but</text>
  <text start="928.7" dur="3.66">this won&amp;#39;t happen in the beginning</text>
  <text start="929.75" dur="4.65">phases it will happen later down the</text>
  <text start="932.36" dur="4.8">line and the founding fathers has told</text>
