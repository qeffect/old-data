  <text start="100.33" dur="4.41">Protection Team the high-frequency</text>
  <text start="101.35" dur="6.93">traders they took a market that was 250</text>
  <text start="104.74" dur="7.35">plus points down and slowly brought it</text>
  <text start="108.28" dur="8.339">up all day long and even pushed it as</text>
  <text start="112.09" dur="6.419">far as a positive 200 now what makes</text>
  <text start="116.619" dur="3.601">this very interesting is first it&amp;#39;s on a</text>
  <text start="118.509" dur="3.121">Friday this is what they normally do</text>
  <text start="120.22" dur="5.13">they make it so you go into the weekend</text>
  <text start="121.63" dur="10.73">on a positive note second we received</text>
  <text start="125.35" dur="11.1">bad data bad news the job numbers are in</text>
  <text start="132.36" dur="6.19">there a complete disaster the job</text>
  <text start="136.45" dur="6.96">numbers came in at a hundred and forty</text>
  <text start="138.55" dur="8.04">two thousand jobs that were added 60,000</text>
  <text start="143.41" dur="4.439">below the consensus now of course we</text>
  <text start="146.59" dur="2.88">understand that these numbers are</text>
  <text start="147.849" dur="5.101">manipulated they do whatever they</text>
  <text start="149.47" dur="6.33">possibly can to boost them but when you</text>
  <text start="152.95" dur="5.55">don&amp;#39;t have the people finding jobs and</text>
  <text start="155.8" dur="5.31">there are more layoffs and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="158.5" dur="4.439">continually accelerating it gets very</text>
  <text start="161.11" dur="2.97">difficult to manipulate all of this now</text>
  <text start="162.939" dur="2.281">of course they</text>
  <text start="164.08" dur="2.4">might have to start making this out of</text>
  <text start="165.22" dur="4.98">thin air maybe they&amp;#39;ve been doing it all</text>
  <text start="166.48" dur="6.54">along but we can see at this point as</text>
  <text start="170.2" dur="5.7">time goes on it&amp;#39;s getting harder and</text>
  <text start="173.02" dur="4.95">harder to do look the Auguste print they</text>
  <text start="175.9" dur="3.87">secretly revised it down remember they</text>
  <text start="177.97" dur="2.85">told us hey it was a pretty good month</text>
  <text start="179.77" dur="2.7">we&amp;#39;re gonna bring the unemployment down</text>
  <text start="180.82" dur="2.91">to five point one percent we added one</text>
  <text start="182.47" dur="3.69">hundred and seventy three thousand jobs</text>
  <text start="183.73" dur="6.42">Paul they lowered it down to a hundred</text>
  <text start="186.16" dur="5.85">and thirty six thousand Oh which is a</text>
  <text start="190.15" dur="3.78">lot worse than what came in at a hundred</text>
  <text start="192.01" dur="3.03">and forty two thousand for this month so</text>
  <text start="193.93" dur="4.08">you know they&amp;#39;re gonna revise that</text>
  <text start="195.04" dur="5.67">number down further as we move into</text>
  <text start="198.01" dur="4.32">October November so basically we lost</text>
  <text start="200.71" dur="5.01">about two hundred and thirty six</text>
  <text start="202.33" dur="6.48">thousand jobs in September sound like a</text>
  <text start="205.72" dur="6.41">recovery to anyone it doesn&amp;#39;t to me so</text>
  <text start="208.81" dur="6.09">let&amp;#39;s put this into perspective in 2015</text>
  <text start="212.13" dur="4.9">job growth has averaged about a hundred</text>
  <text start="214.9" dur="4.02">ninety eight thousand per month compared</text>
  <text start="217.03" dur="5.75">with an average monthly gain of two</text>
  <text start="218.92" dur="6.06">hundred and sixty thousand jobs in 2014</text>
  <text start="222.78" dur="4.84">but the unemployment is done at five</text>
  <text start="224.98" dur="4.77">point one percent think about with what</text>
  <text start="227.62" dur="6.36">they&amp;#39;ve been doing and how it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="229.75" dur="7.44">harder and harder for them to cover this</text>
  <text start="233.98" dur="5.37">up and as we move forward it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="237.19" dur="4.92">really become difficult because we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="239.35" dur="4.889">been looking at real information they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="242.11" dur="5.19">been feeding us manipulated information</text>
  <text start="244.239" dur="4.53">and they&amp;#39;re too these two pieces of</text>
  <text start="247.3" dur="2.969">information are now separating</text>
  <text start="248.769" dur="3.451">themselves and this is why the</text>
  <text start="250.269" dur="5.281">government the central bankers are in a</text>
  <text start="252.22" dur="5.34">panic they realize this system they</text>
  <text start="255.55" dur="4.29">can&amp;#39;t keep this up can&amp;#39;t keep this up</text>
  <text start="257.56" dur="7.17">much longer it&amp;#39;s getting very very</text>
  <text start="259.84" dur="8.13">difficult to do so so of the 142,000</text>
  <text start="264.73" dur="5.91">jobs that were added in September 24,000</text>
  <text start="267.97" dur="4.62">of them work government jobs because you</text>
  <text start="270.64" dur="5.16">know we need more government employees</text>
  <text start="272.59" dur="7.17">it helps the country grow no no it</text>
  <text start="275.8" dur="6.75">doesn&amp;#39;t it doesn&amp;#39;t do anything this is</text>
  <text start="279.76" dur="5.04">not where the growth needs to be so if</text>
  <text start="282.55" dur="4.32">we remove the people who got government</text>
  <text start="284.8" dur="3.42">jobs in twenty four thousand we have</text>
  <text start="286.87" dur="4.26">about a hundred and eighteen thousand</text>
  <text start="288.22" dur="4.91">for the private sector and let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="291.13" dur="6.33">where they went well</text>
  <text start="293.13" dur="4.9">78% went to low minimum wage paying jobs</text>
  <text start="297.46" dur="4.71">leisure</text>
  <text start="298.03" dur="7.44">hospitality was about 30% adding about</text>
  <text start="302.17" dur="5.81">35,000 jobs 25% went for education and</text>
  <text start="305.47" dur="5.7">health which are more minimum-wage jobs</text>
  <text start="307.98" dur="6.67">with retail and temp help renting out</text>
  <text start="311.17" dur="6.92">the remaining 23% so what are we seeing</text>
  <text start="314.65" dur="8.46">we&amp;#39;re seeing manufacturing mining</text>
  <text start="318.09" dur="7.84">good-paying jobs declining I mean this</text>
  <text start="323.11" dur="6.39">is a complete disaster it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="325.93" dur="6.93">worse and worse as time goes on so in</text>
  <text start="329.5" dur="5.64">September the US economy added 21,000</text>
  <text start="332.86" dur="6.57">waiters and bartenders and lost another</text>
  <text start="335.14" dur="6.72">9,000 manufacturing workers that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="339.43" dur="5.55">good because if we look at the trend</text>
  <text start="341.86" dur="5.88">what are we seeing since the start of</text>
  <text start="344.98" dur="6.72">the depression in December of 2007</text>
  <text start="347.74" dur="5.79">the US economy right now has added 1.5</text>
  <text start="351.7" dur="5.54">million waiters and bartenders and lost</text>
  <text start="353.53" dur="8.82">1.4 million manufacturing jobs and</text>
  <text start="357.24" dur="7.6">they&amp;#39;re expecting the u.s. to come out</text>
  <text start="362.35" dur="6.45">of this Great Recession in this full</text>
  <text start="364.84" dur="8.46">recovery how in the world is this going</text>
  <text start="368.8" dur="6.42">to work it cannot and you can see what</text>
  <text start="373.3" dur="5.97">they had to do they had to take the</text>
  <text start="375.22" dur="6.87">people off of the job search and say</text>
  <text start="379.27" dur="6.33">they&amp;#39;re not looking anymore because in</text>
  <text start="382.09" dur="8.52">September the people not in the labor</text>
  <text start="385.6" dur="7.86">force soared by a whopping 579 thousand</text>
  <text start="390.61" dur="6.15">to a record ninety four point six</text>
  <text start="393.46" dur="9.15">million up from the previous record of</text>
  <text start="396.76" dur="9.18">94 million so they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="402.61" dur="7.17">us that these people they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="405.94" dur="7.17">work and they don&amp;#39;t want to pay for</text>
  <text start="409.78" dur="4.65">their house or apartment they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="413.11" dur="3.54">to pay for their car because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="414.43" dur="3.84">want to have a job they don&amp;#39;t want food</text>
  <text start="416.65" dur="2.13">they don&amp;#39;t want to provide for the</text>
  <text start="418.27" dur="2.73">family</text>
  <text start="418.78" dur="3.69">they never want to go on a vacation they</text>
  <text start="421" dur="4.05">just want to sit home and do absolutely</text>
  <text start="422.47" dur="5.79">nothing they don&amp;#39;t want to work they</text>
  <text start="425.05" dur="6.33">have no Drive seriously are we really</text>
  <text start="428.26" dur="3.42">gonna believe the government and the</text>
  <text start="431.38" dur="2.06">core</text>
  <text start="431.68" dur="6.299">but Media trying to convince us that</text>
  <text start="433.44" dur="7.36">ninety 4.6 million people they just</text>
  <text start="437.979" dur="5.731">don&amp;#39;t want to work and this is why</text>
  <text start="440.8" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;re out of the labor market the</text>
  <text start="443.71" dur="6.42">participation rate crashed again now it</text>
  <text start="446.86" dur="5.73">slid from sixty two point six to sixty</text>
  <text start="450.13" dur="5.64">two point four percent it was the lowest</text>
  <text start="452.59" dur="8.34">since October of nineteen seventy seven</text>
  <text start="455.77" dur="9.48">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="460.93" dur="8.85">according to the BLS 53,000 part-time</text>
  <text start="465.25" dur="7.4">jobs were added in September and we lost</text>
  <text start="469.78" dur="7.979">a hundred and eighty-five thousand</text>
  <text start="472.65" dur="8.23">full-time jobs ah I guess it must be all</text>
  <text start="477.759" dur="6.241">those layoffs but what&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="480.88" dur="8.42">interesting is we increased the number</text>
  <text start="484" dur="11.69">of foreign-born workers by three hundred</text>
  <text start="489.3" dur="11.41">percent so they are getting the low paid</text>
  <text start="495.69" dur="9.159">minimum wage jobs they are corporations</text>
  <text start="500.71" dur="7.65">are instructed to take these illegals on</text>
  <text start="504.849" dur="8.701">first because they don&amp;#39;t have to get the</text>
  <text start="508.36" dur="8.849">penalty for Obamacare and they need</text>
  <text start="513.55" dur="7.109">fresh people in the work force to take</text>
  <text start="517.209" dur="5.971">out auto loans student loans they need</text>
  <text start="520.659" dur="4.941">people in the military and eventually</text>
  <text start="523.18" dur="5.43">over time Obama will make them a</text>
  <text start="525.6" dur="6.22">civilian a citizen I should say citizen</text>
  <text start="528.61" dur="6.83">to go on to Obamacare because he needs</text>
  <text start="531.82" dur="6.36">twenty two million people to keep</text>
  <text start="535.44" dur="10.71">Obamacare afloat or the whole thing</text>
  <text start="538.18" dur="12.27">comes crashing down so we have seen huge</text>
  <text start="546.15" dur="7.96">corporations laying off thousands upon</text>
  <text start="550.45" dur="6.87">thousands of people and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="554.11" dur="5.91">to convince us that everything is ok and</text>
  <text start="557.32" dur="6.18">I see these corporate headlines in the</text>
  <text start="560.02" dur="5.58">corporate media saying that just because</text>
  <text start="563.5" dur="5.37">people aren&amp;#39;t working doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="565.6" dur="4.859">we&amp;#39;re not in a recovery really so when</text>
  <text start="568.87" dur="4.409">people don&amp;#39;t work this is what a</text>
  <text start="570.459" dur="5.221">recovery looks like I guess when retail</text>
  <text start="573.279" dur="4.321">closes down and people are laid off from</text>
  <text start="575.68" dur="3.54">retail that&amp;#39;s what the recovery looks</text>
  <text start="577.6" dur="4.56">like I guess when housing starts to</text>
  <text start="579.22" dur="5.369">implode that&amp;#39;s what a recovery looks</text>
  <text start="582.16" dur="4.59">like I mean they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re just trying</text>
  <text start="584.589" dur="6.06">to give any type of answer and to</text>
  <text start="586.75" dur="7.74">explain this away but when we look we we</text>
  <text start="590.649" dur="8.221">see there are so many companies laying</text>
  <text start="594.49" dur="5.69">off hewlett-packard 30,000 Target 17,000</text>

  <text start="649.779" dur="2.851">it&amp;#39;s going to accelerate do you really</text>

  <text start="793.99" dur="6.27">listen to it he pretty much maps it out</text>
  <text start="796.9" dur="5.81">on what is going to happen here and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="800.26" dur="6.12">something that you need to listen to and</text>
  <text start="802.71" dur="6.82">at this point we see that the stock</text>
  <text start="806.38" dur="8.25">market the gold precious metal market</text>
  <text start="809.53" dur="9.48">all completely manipulated and it</text>
  <text start="814.63" dur="9.12">doesn&amp;#39;t take into account the high</text>
  <text start="819.01" dur="8.21">demand for precious metals because right</text>
  <text start="823.75" dur="6.96">now the US Mint they are seeing record</text>
  <text start="827.22" dur="6.37">silver sales in the third quarter they</text>
  <text start="830.71" dur="5.58">people are looking for physical</text>

  <text start="850.089" dur="7.771">to 1986 dealers and mints traced the</text>
  <text start="854.23" dur="5.46">supply squeeze to a burst of buying by</text>
  <text start="857.86" dur="6.72">mom-and-pop investors in the United</text>
  <text start="859.69" dur="8.339">States they see that something is wrong</text>
  <text start="864.58" dur="6.33">in the economy they understand they need</text>
  <text start="868.029" dur="4.891">to hold silver and gold now a lot of</text>
  <text start="870.91" dur="4.47">people don&amp;#39;t have the funds to purchase</text>
  <text start="872.92" dur="4.62">gold so they purchase silver and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="875.38" dur="4.02">seeing a lot of this and all those</text>
  <text start="877.54" dur="3.92">people that are working part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="879.4" dur="4.5">who don&amp;#39;t have the discretionary funds</text>
  <text start="881.46" dur="5.62">it&amp;#39;s a little bit harder and silver</text>
  <text start="883.9" dur="4.8">right now is very inexpensive actually I</text>
  <text start="887.08" dur="3.03">shouldn&amp;#39;t even say you&amp;#39;re buying it what</text>
  <text start="888.7" dur="3.81">you&amp;#39;re doing is you&amp;#39;re trading your</text>
  <text start="890.11" dur="8.91">paper money for physical precious metals</text>
  <text start="892.51" dur="9.24">and this system right now in no way can</text>
  <text start="899.02" dur="5.91">be sustained according to the Fed right</text>
  <text start="901.75" dur="7.22">now there is about 60 trillion of US</text>
  <text start="904.93" dur="7.409">dollars credit claims for the US dollar</text>
  <text start="908.97" dur="7.99">according to the Fed there are about 12</text>
  <text start="912.339" dur="7.441">trillion US dollars so the data shows</text>
  <text start="916.96" dur="5.82">plainly there are five times as many</text>
  <text start="919.78" dur="8.67">claims for US dollars as US dollars in</text>
  <text start="922.78" dur="8.25">existence why does this matter well it</text>
  <text start="928.45" dur="7.44">does matter because there is not enough</text>
  <text start="931.03" dur="6.96">money to repay the outstanding debt the</text>
  <text start="935.89" dur="4.199">widening gap between credit and money is</text>
  <text start="937.99" dur="2.46">making it more difficult to serve as the</text>
  <text start="940.089" dur="3.661">debt</text>
  <text start="940.45" dur="5.55">remember only a dollar can service and</text>
  <text start="943.75" dur="4.05">repay dollar-denominated debt principal</text>
  <text start="946" dur="5.43">and the interest payments cannot be made</text>
  <text start="947.8" dur="6.659">with widgets or labor only dollars and</text>
  <text start="951.43" dur="5.46">this is how the system is designed it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="954.459" dur="4.981">designed like this on purpose where</text>
  <text start="956.89" dur="7.11">there&amp;#39;s always more debt than there are</text>
  <text start="959.44" dur="6.99">dollars and as the system grows and</text>
  <text start="964" dur="5.76">grows and grows it cannot be sustained</text>
  <text start="966.43" dur="6.3">it&amp;#39;s completely impossible credit</text>
  <text start="969.76" dur="5.7">generated growth is not growth in real</text>
  <text start="972.73" dur="5.7">inflation-adjusted terms because rising</text>
  <text start="975.46" dur="5.61">GDP which engenders an increase in money</text>
  <text start="978.43" dur="5.76">is also accompanied by a large increase</text>
  <text start="981.07" dur="6.15">in claims on that money why larger</text>
  <text start="984.19" dur="7.13">because debt comes with interest and it</text>
  <text start="987.22" dur="7.08">cannot be sustained it&amp;#39;s impossible and</text>
  <text start="991.32" dur="3.81">this is why we see everything happening</text>
  <text start="994.3" dur="8.28">right now</text>
  <text start="995.13" dur="10.81">we need a government to create money</text>
  <text start="1002.58" dur="5.57">without interest we don&amp;#39;t need a central</text>
  <text start="1005.94" dur="6.09">bank loaning money to the government</text>
  <text start="1008.15" dur="6.28">there&amp;#39;s no reason for it and if somebody</text>
  <text start="1012.03" dur="5.34">can give me a reason please let me know</text>
  <text start="1014.43" dur="5.94">but why do we need a separate entity a</text>
  <text start="1017.37" dur="4.59">separate corporation creating money for</text>
  <text start="1020.37" dur="5.4">the government and why do they have to</text>
  <text start="1021.96" dur="6.36">borrow from this separate entity with</text>
  <text start="1025.77" dur="3.569">interest on it it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="1028.32" dur="3.269">whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1029.339" dur="6.391">there&amp;#39;s no reason whatsoever to have</text>
  <text start="1031.589" dur="7.561">this because the Fed which is a private</text>
  <text start="1035.73" dur="5.69">corporation is just back in the old days</text>
  <text start="1039.15" dur="4.61">just starting a printing press and</text>
  <text start="1041.42" dur="5.38">shoving paper in it and it created money</text>
  <text start="1043.76" dur="4.75">now they&amp;#39;re just hitting a button it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1046.8" dur="3.48">not like they have any secret of where</text>
  <text start="1048.51" dur="4.14">they get it they just do it out of thin</text>
  <text start="1050.28" dur="4.89">air the government under the</text>
  <text start="1052.65" dur="5.46">Constitution can do the same thing and</text>
  <text start="1055.17" dur="6.78">guess what there&amp;#39;ll be no interest</text>
  <text start="1058.11" dur="6.51">attached and this is what the founding</text>
  <text start="1061.95" dur="5.76">fathers originally wanted they knew</text>
  <text start="1064.62" dur="7.47">these central banks eventually would try</text>
  <text start="1067.71" dur="6.69">to move in and take over before the</text>
  <text start="1072.09" dur="6.6">Federal Reserve there were three others</text>
  <text start="1074.4" dur="6.36">that tried but failed and as the Federal</text>
  <text start="1078.69" dur="3.84">Reserve was born they didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1080.76" dur="3.75">call it a central bank they wanted to</text>
  <text start="1082.53" dur="3.12">call it something where people thought</text>
  <text start="1084.51" dur="4.74">it was part of the government and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1085.65" dur="6.78">why they named it Federal Reserve now</text>
  <text start="1089.25" dur="6.54">France is looking to maybe step away</text>
  <text start="1092.43" dur="6.959">from the TTIP negotiations Francis jr.</text>
  <text start="1095.79" dur="5.669">Trade Minister Matthias vekl has</text>
  <text start="1099.389" dur="3.63">threaten outright termination of his</text>

  <text start="1103.019" dur="5.19">transatlantic trade and investment</text>
  <text start="1104.399" dur="7.86">partnership why you say for total lack</text>
  <text start="1108.209" dur="6.18">of transparency he&amp;#39;s saying that they</text>
  <text start="1112.259" dur="5.76">have no idea what this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="1114.389" dur="5.82">about they have received no real</text>
  <text start="1118.019" dur="5.91">information they won&amp;#39;t really let us</text>
  <text start="1120.209" dur="6.81">look at it and there is no transparency</text>
  <text start="1123.929" dur="4.8">well yeah it&amp;#39;s for the corporations it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1127.019" dur="5.79">not for the governments it&amp;#39;s not for the</text>
  <text start="1128.729" dur="8.971">people this is why they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1132.809" dur="7.86">anyone looking at this now I just wanted</text>
  <text start="1137.7" dur="5.819">to talk to everyone and we need to look</text>
  <text start="1140.669" dur="5.01">at where we are right now we see all of</text>
  <text start="1143.519" dur="6.83">this information being thrown at us</text>
  <text start="1145.679" dur="6.42">about the economy is recovering</text>
  <text start="1150.349" dur="3.101">everything is fine</text>
  <text start="1152.099" dur="4.11">the Fed is going to be raising interest</text>
  <text start="1153.45" dur="5.459">rates and they keep promising all of</text>
  <text start="1156.209" dur="4.981">this stuff but everything that we looked</text>
  <text start="1158.909" dur="5.67">at in the last couple of years up to</text>
  <text start="1161.19" dur="5.809">this point we see how the economy has</text>
  <text start="1164.579" dur="5.43">worsened not gotten better and</text>
