  <text start="144.56" dur="2.34">course the corporate media is out there</text>
  <text start="145.76" dur="3.3">telling us that this is some type of</text>
  <text start="146.9" dur="6.12">correction that is needed and everything</text>
  <text start="149.06" dur="6.06">is just fine and everything is ok but we</text>
  <text start="153.02" dur="7.32">understand because we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="155.12" dur="8.13">all of this and we&amp;#39;ve been viewing the</text>
  <text start="160.34" dur="3.6">economic indicators and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="163.25" dur="4.26">seeing</text>
  <text start="163.94" dur="6.72">that this whole thing is about ready to</text>
  <text start="167.51" dur="6.03">completely collapse on itself I mean we</text>
  <text start="170.66" dur="4.92">talked about the students who are</text>
  <text start="173.54" dur="3.57">graduating college who cannot find jobs</text>
  <text start="175.58" dur="3.6">now of course the United States</text>
  <text start="177.11" dur="3.24">government central bankers the corporate</text>
  <text start="179.18" dur="2.76">media and everyone else says no</text>
  <text start="180.35" dur="3.39">everything is fine they&amp;#39;re finding jobs</text>
  <text start="181.94" dur="4.23">go back to school get an education and</text>
  <text start="183.74" dur="4.2">what are we seeing right now well</text>
  <text start="186.17" dur="5.13">there&amp;#39;s a new report that came out and</text>
  <text start="187.94" dur="5.79">nearly 7 million Americans have gone at</text>
  <text start="191.3" dur="5.7">least a year without making a payment on</text>
  <text start="193.73" dur="6.15">their federal student loans a staggering</text>
  <text start="197" dur="5.31">level of default that highlights how</text>
  <text start="199.88" dur="6.21">student debt continues to burden</text>
  <text start="202.31" dur="6">households despite this improving labor</text>
  <text start="206.09" dur="8.19">market where the unemployment is down by</text>
  <text start="208.31" dur="7.47">five point three percent as of July 6.9</text>
  <text start="214.28" dur="4.23">million Americans with student loans</text>
  <text start="215.78" dur="6.54">hadn&amp;#39;t sent a payment to the government</text>
  <text start="218.51" dur="6.69">and at least 360 days now why would that</text>
  <text start="222.32" dur="6.169">be if everything is absolutely perfectly</text>
  <text start="225.2" dur="5.34">fine and everyone&amp;#39;s getting a job</text>
  <text start="228.489" dur="5.771">quarterly data from the education</text>
  <text start="230.54" dur="8.85">department showed this week that these</text>
  <text start="234.26" dur="9.9">people cannot make these payments this</text>
  <text start="239.39" dur="9.87">was up six percent or 400,000 borrowers</text>
  <text start="244.16" dur="7.65">from a year earlier think about this the</text>
  <text start="249.26" dur="4.199">figures translate into about 70 17</text>
  <text start="251.81" dur="3.87">percent of all bars with federal loans</text>
  <text start="253.459" dur="6.09">being severely delinquent now remember</text>
  <text start="255.68" dur="6.089">they only indicate that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="259.549" dur="6.421">delinquent if you haven&amp;#39;t made a payment</text>
  <text start="261.769" dur="5.521">and 360 day that&amp;#39;s their threshold so</text>
  <text start="265.97" dur="3.51">though whose people right now who</text>
  <text start="267.29" dur="4.98">haven&amp;#39;t made payments at 180 days guess</text>
  <text start="269.48" dur="4.98">what they don&amp;#39;t have work either but it</text>
  <text start="272.27" dur="7.92">doesn&amp;#39;t show up on their books of being</text>
  <text start="274.46" dur="11.4">delinquent so if we add those in this</text>
  <text start="280.19" dur="7.65">percentage is much much higher this</text>
  <text start="285.86" dur="5.22">shows you that something is wrong and</text>
  <text start="287.84" dur="5.88">this affects the economy economists have</text>
  <text start="291.08" dur="5.58">warned of student loan defense Diaw</text>
  <text start="293.72" dur="5.55">default because it</text>
  <text start="296.66" dur="5.76">basically messes up their credit it</text>
  <text start="299.27" dur="6.03">hurts their ability to buy things like</text>
  <text start="302.42" dur="4.8">cars and homes they don&amp;#39;t take their</text>
  <text start="305.3" dur="6.39">money and shop in retail shops and buy</text>
  <text start="307.22" dur="8.37">the goods and this puts a huge strain on</text>
  <text start="311.69" dur="8.19">the economy and we also have to remember</text>
  <text start="315.59" dur="8.13">this youth who just graduated this is</text>
  <text start="319.88" dur="6.33">the next generation so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="323.72" dur="8.28">right now is a complete and total</text>
  <text start="326.21" dur="7.68">collapse of the entire system how are</text>
  <text start="332" dur="3.54">they going to improve this why because</text>
  <text start="333.89" dur="3.39">now these college graduates have come</text>
  <text start="335.54" dur="3.57">out they can get a part-time job this is</text>
  <text start="337.28" dur="6.18">not going to help we see it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="339.11" dur="6.93">helping it&amp;#39;s making things worse it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.46" dur="4.5">making people believe that they can go</text>
  <text start="346.04" dur="3.45">to college right now and get this</text>
  <text start="347.96" dur="4.23">fantastic job but you know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="349.49" dur="5.82">happening all of these people are ending</text>
  <text start="352.19" dur="5.79">up with a huge amount of debt with no</text>
  <text start="355.31" dur="5.13">job that&amp;#39;s it but again we have to</text>
  <text start="357.98" dur="4.32">remember this is what the central</text>
  <text start="360.44" dur="5.1">bankers want because debt is their</text>
  <text start="362.3" dur="6.27">product they need to spread the debt</text>
  <text start="365.54" dur="4.8">without it they&amp;#39;re doomed so they need</text>
  <text start="368.57" dur="3.57">to inflate the student loan bubble they</text>
  <text start="370.34" dur="5.06">need to inflate the auto loan bubble</text>
  <text start="372.14" dur="5.76">they need to inflate the housing bubble</text>
  <text start="375.4" dur="5.56">the Treasury bond market the stock</text>
  <text start="377.9" dur="6.65">market all of this needs to be inflated</text>
  <text start="380.96" dur="6.09">or this entire things come crashing down</text>
  <text start="384.55" dur="5.56">now something very interesting this came</text>
  <text start="387.05" dur="8.01">out of a special report from stl today</text>
  <text start="390.11" dur="7.43">and this spring traders and analysts</text>
  <text start="395.06" dur="5.3">working deep in the global swaps market</text>
  <text start="397.54" dur="5.08">began picking up peculiar readings</text>
  <text start="400.36" dur="4.84">hundreds of billions of dollars of</text>
  <text start="402.62" dur="6.66">trades by US banks had seemingly</text>
  <text start="405.2" dur="6.03">completely vanished gone the vanishing</text>
  <text start="409.28" dur="3.84">of the trades was little noted outside a</text>
  <text start="411.23" dur="3.9">circle of specialists but the</text>
  <text start="413.12" dur="4.56">implications were big the missing</text>
  <text start="415.13" dur="5.88">transactions reflected an effort by some</text>
  <text start="417.68" dur="5.37">of the largest US banks like Goldman</text>
  <text start="421.01" dur="4.65">Sachs JP Morgan Chase Citigroup bank of</text>
  <text start="423.05" dur="7.38">america Morgan Stanley to get around new</text>
  <text start="425.66" dur="6.87">regulations on derivatives enacted</text>
  <text start="430.43" dur="5.37">in the wake of the financial crisis back</text>
  <text start="432.53" dur="5.73">in two thousand eight the trades hadn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="435.8" dur="5.64">really disappeared instead the major</text>
  <text start="438.26" dur="6.39">banks had tweaked a few key words in</text>
  <text start="441.44" dur="6.21">swap contracts and shifted some of their</text>
  <text start="444.65" dur="5.75">trades to affiliates in London out of</text>
  <text start="447.65" dur="8.16">the United States where regulations are</text>
  <text start="450.4" dur="7.66">far more lenient those affiliates remain</text>
  <text start="455.81" dur="7.62">largely outside the jurisdiction of the</text>
  <text start="458.06" dur="7.14">US regulators in late 2010 the CFTC</text>
  <text start="463.43" dur="3.69">began drafting new rules regulating</text>
  <text start="465.2" dur="4.92">derivative markets as mandated by</text>
  <text start="467.12" dur="4.98">Congress and a landmark act which was</text>
  <text start="470.12" dur="10.02">the dodd-frank Wall Street Reform Act</text>
  <text start="472.1" dur="11.34">and these bankers basically went around</text>
  <text start="480.14" dur="5.4">it by tricked by changing a few key</text>
  <text start="483.44" dur="5.67">words and we have to remember this</text>
  <text start="485.54" dur="7.74">derivative market is huge think about</text>
  <text start="489.11" dur="6.27">this for a second back in 1999 the</text>
  <text start="493.28" dur="7.13">derivative market is around eight eighty</text>
  <text start="495.38" dur="10.26">eight trillion in 2008 it was at 672</text>
  <text start="500.41" dur="8.53">trillion today it&amp;#39;s double that this is</text>
  <text start="505.64" dur="5.67">how big this is and this is bets on bets</text>
  <text start="508.94" dur="5.19">on bets on bets and when it comes</text>
  <text start="511.31" dur="9.87">crumbling down this whole thing is going</text>
  <text start="514.13" dur="9.81">to fall apart bankers always seem to</text>
  <text start="521.18" dur="5.4">maneuver around everything just like in</text>
  <text start="523.94" dur="4.77">Greece just like in Puerto Rico when</text>
  <text start="526.58" dur="5.82">things are defaulting they called a</text>
  <text start="528.71" dur="7.13">moratorium of payments so basically what</text>
  <text start="532.4" dur="6.62">we have right now is that this system</text>
  <text start="535.84" dur="5.5">with all these derivatives and</text>
  <text start="539.02" dur="5.56">everything that we&amp;#39;re seeing this whole</text>
  <text start="541.34" dur="9.51">thing is getting ready to come crumbling</text>
  <text start="544.58" dur="9.45">down yesterday in the report we talked</text>
  <text start="550.85" dur="5.22">about Spotify how they were going to spy</text>
  <text start="554.03" dur="5.1">on the people and the founders of</text>
  <text start="556.07" dur="6.15">Spotify said um yeah the new terms and</text>
  <text start="559.13" dur="5.25">conditions yeah we made a mistake here</text>
  <text start="562.22" dur="3.87">the whole thing was just a really big</text>
  <text start="564.38" dur="3.45">standing we&amp;#39;re not going to spy on the</text>
  <text start="566.09" dur="3.51">people we&amp;#39;re not going to collect their</text>
  <text start="567.83" dur="4.83">information so you can just forget about</text>
  <text start="569.6" dur="5.34">that and we&amp;#39;re really sorry basically</text>
  <text start="572.66" dur="4.74">they got caught people actually read the</text>
  <text start="574.94" dur="5.58">Terms of Service and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="577.4" dur="5.97">backtracking we see the war is being</text>
  <text start="580.52" dur="4.41">pushed in North Korea right now we know</text>
  <text start="583.37" dur="4.2">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="584.93" dur="6.86">bankers are pushing and pushing and</text>
  <text start="587.57" dur="6.33">provoking China Russia North Korea Iran</text>
  <text start="591.79" dur="6.79">Syria all these players are going to be</text>
  <text start="593.9" dur="9.09">the same we know this and Martin I mean</text>
  <text start="598.58" dur="8.55">general Dempsey is out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="602.99" dur="7.98">saying that the United States will</text>
  <text start="607.13" dur="5.76">defend its close ally South Korea amid</text>
  <text start="610.97" dur="5.64">heightening tensions between south and</text>
  <text start="612.89" dur="5.85">the north so basically first we enraged</text>
  <text start="616.61" dur="3.99">North Korea Korea by staging a mock</text>
  <text start="618.74" dur="6.41">invasion of the country having all these</text>
  <text start="620.6" dur="7.88">drills by the demilitarization zone then</text>
  <text start="625.15" dur="9.18">basically we set up speaker systems and</text>
  <text start="628.48" dur="8.26">we mock them and all of a sudden a</text>
  <text start="634.33" dur="6.76">speaker system was fired upon and</text>
  <text start="636.74" dur="6.03">destroyed so this is what the US</text>
  <text start="641.09" dur="3.51">government does their provoking each</text>
  <text start="642.77" dur="5.28">country they want a country to do</text>
  <text start="644.6" dur="7.28">something and North Korea right now</text>
  <text start="648.05" dur="7.23">seems that they will take the bait and</text>
  <text start="651.88" dur="5.53">this is how they&amp;#39;re going to start the</text>
  <text start="655.28" dur="4.5">war and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it starts</text>
  <text start="657.41" dur="4.8">with North Korea or China arrested</text>
  <text start="659.78" dur="6.89">because they&amp;#39;re all going to be the</text>
  <text start="662.21" dur="7.49">players in this next upcoming war and</text>
  <text start="666.67" dur="5.82">what South Korea is saying right now is</text>
  <text start="669.7" dur="6.22">that they&amp;#39;re armed forces will use</text>
  <text start="672.49" dur="5.02">counter-attacks that mimic what North</text>
  <text start="675.92" dur="3.92">Korea does so if they fire machine-gun</text>
  <text start="677.51" dur="4.95">South Korea will fire machine gun if</text>
  <text start="679.84" dur="5.11">North Korea shells them they will shell</text>
  <text start="682.46" dur="7.16">them back he goes but since this last</text>
  <text start="684.95" dur="7.56">speaker incident all bets are off if</text>
  <text start="689.62" dur="4.96">they do something we might not respond</text>
  <text start="692.51" dur="4.2">with machine gun or shell we might not</text>
  <text start="694.58" dur="3.3">mimic what they&amp;#39;re doing we might go all</text>
  <text start="696.71" dur="4.26">out on them</text>
  <text start="697.88" dur="6.75">and we can see that the u.s. and South</text>
  <text start="700.97" dur="5.61">Korea are staging simulated bombing amid</text>
  <text start="704.63" dur="5.16">tensions with North North Korea they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="706.58" dur="5.82">doing it right over there and from all</text>
  <text start="709.79" dur="4.68">of this what are we seeing well the</text>
  <text start="712.4" dur="4.07">United States plans to strengthen its</text>
  <text start="714.47" dur="6.42">military presence in the asia-pacific</text>
  <text start="716.47" dur="9.73">region with more ships and more</text>
  <text start="720.89" dur="9">warplanes they&amp;#39;re going to bring in more</text>
  <text start="726.2" dur="6.18">military assets right now the United</text>
  <text start="729.89" dur="5">States maintains about 368,000 military</text>
  <text start="732.38" dur="4.65">personnel in the asia-pacific region</text>
  <text start="734.89" dur="6.04">you&amp;#39;re going to increase this by thirty</text>
  <text start="737.03" dur="5.97">percent and out of the same report the</text>
