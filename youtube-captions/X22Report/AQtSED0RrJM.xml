  <text start="31.74" dur="4.83">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="35.19" dur="5.1">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="36.57" dur="6.3">episode 1778 and today&amp;#39;s date is January</text>
  <text start="40.29" dur="5.67">20th 2019 and the title of the episode</text>
  <text start="42.87" dur="5.45">is the central banks are quietly being</text>
  <text start="45.96" dur="4.65">maneuvered into their own destruction</text>
  <text start="48.32" dur="5.169">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="50.61" dur="4.589">financial news now Trump tweeted out</text>
  <text start="53.489" dur="4.441">something very interesting today about</text>
  <text start="55.199" dur="3.901">the economy where he said it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="57.93" dur="2.879">the economy but I&amp;#39;m gonna be getting</text>
  <text start="59.1" dur="5.489">into his tweet a little bit later in</text>
  <text start="60.809" dur="7.381">this report but the reason why Trump and</text>
  <text start="64.589" dur="5.34">the Patriots are continually pushing the</text>
  <text start="68.19" dur="3.87">economy on the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="69.929" dur="3.69">because they are maneuvering the</text>
  <text start="72.06" dur="6.38">mainstream media and the central bank</text>
  <text start="73.619" dur="7.051">down this path in this gigantic maze and</text>
  <text start="78.44" dur="5.38">every time the mainstream media or the</text>
  <text start="80.67" dur="3.739">central bank moves in a different</text>
  <text start="83.82" dur="3.24">direction</text>
  <text start="84.409" dur="4.811">they course-correct them and they bring</text>
  <text start="87.06" dur="5.58">them back and there&amp;#39;s a reason for this</text>
  <text start="89.22" dur="5.52">because they want them to follow the</text>
  <text start="92.64" dur="3.57">plan now they&amp;#39;re making media in the</text>
  <text start="94.74" dur="4.199">central bank they don&amp;#39;t know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="96.21" dur="5.67">following this plan they think oh we</text>
  <text start="98.939" dur="4.651">have one on him or ooh look at this</text>
  <text start="101.88" dur="4.559">we&amp;#39;re gonna go in this direction because</text>
  <text start="103.59" dur="5.94">Trump is going in this direction Trump</text>
  <text start="106.439" dur="4.89">the Patriots they understand how to</text>
  <text start="109.53" dur="4.409">manipulate this economy they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="111.329" dur="4.621">the same exact tools as the deep state I</text>
  <text start="113.939" dur="4.081">do believe that Trump has full control</text>
  <text start="115.95" dur="4.44">over the Fed and can have the Fed do</text>
  <text start="118.02" dur="4.83">whatever he wants they are not</text>
  <text start="120.39" dur="6.39">independent anymore they&amp;#39;re dependent on</text>
  <text start="122.85" dur="7.49">him Powell I do believe is working for</text>
  <text start="126.78" dur="7.08">Trump and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="130.34" dur="5.649">they&amp;#39;re bringing the fed the mainstream</text>
  <text start="133.86" dur="7.82">media down this path through this</text>
  <text start="135.989" dur="11.22">gigantic maze to eventually audit and</text>
  <text start="141.68" dur="7.72">abolish the Fed the IRS and expose the</text>
  <text start="147.209" dur="4.201">mainstream media we&amp;#39;re gonna be getting</text>
  <text start="149.4" dur="3.78">into that in just a minute but first I</text>
  <text start="151.41" dur="3.72">wanted to start off with what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="153.18" dur="5.49">happening out in the UK with the brexit</text>
  <text start="155.13" dur="4.77">and we know the brakes a deal didn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="158.67" dur="5.219">through and of course the brags a deal</text>
  <text start="159.9" dur="5.24">was not for the people of the UK this</text>
  <text start="163.889" dur="5.041">was</text>
  <text start="165.14" dur="5.83">for the EU for the central bankers this</text>
  <text start="168.93" dur="6.47">is what they wanted but something very</text>
  <text start="170.97" dur="7.74">interesting is happening Australia is</text>
  <text start="175.4" dur="8.37">forming a bilateral trade agreement with</text>
  <text start="178.71" dur="8.19">the UK and this is a wine agreement and</text>
  <text start="183.77" dur="7.24">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="186.9" dur="6.72">this deal if the brexit actually does</text>
  <text start="191.01" dur="5.37">happen but what I find very interesting</text>
  <text start="193.62" dur="7.23">about this is that it&amp;#39;s a bilateral</text>
  <text start="196.38" dur="6.48">trade agreement if the UK would do what</text>
  <text start="200.85" dur="3.95">Trump is doing what China is doing and</text>
  <text start="202.86" dur="4.56">make these bilateral trade agreements</text>
  <text start="204.8" dur="4.84">the EU would be in trouble</text>
  <text start="207.42" dur="5.16">so let me go through what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="209.64" dur="5.01">here this new bilateral trade agreement</text>
  <text start="212.58" dur="4.08">which is the wine agreement and mutual</text>
  <text start="214.65" dur="4.17">recognition agreement was signed in</text>
  <text start="216.66" dur="4.83">London on Saturday designed to help ease</text>
  <text start="218.82" dur="6.69">the continued flow of post brexit trade</text>
  <text start="221.49" dur="6.48">between Australia and the UK and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="225.51" dur="4.14">doing this because they understand they</text>
  <text start="227.97" dur="5.16">need to continue to have trade no matter</text>
  <text start="229.65" dur="4.86">what Trump got rid of all the globalist</text>
  <text start="233.13" dur="4.02">trade deals most of them in here</text>
  <text start="234.51" dur="6.75">renegotiated a lot of the globalist</text>
  <text start="237.15" dur="6.99">trade deals and he started to talk to</text>
  <text start="241.26" dur="4.83">other countries and he started to have</text>
  <text start="244.14" dur="3.96">bilateral trade agreements with these</text>
  <text start="246.09" dur="3.78">other countries China does the same</text>
  <text start="248.1" dur="3.03">thing and Russia does the same thing</text>
  <text start="249.87" dur="3.51">where they have these bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="251.13" dur="5.28">agreements and it&amp;#39;s actually a good</text>
  <text start="253.38" dur="5.94">thing to have separate trade agreements</text>
  <text start="256.41" dur="4.86">with each country because of one goes</text>
  <text start="259.32" dur="7.17">south you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about the</text>
  <text start="261.27" dur="10.59">rest it&amp;#39;s decentralized and we can see</text>
  <text start="266.49" dur="8.49">that the UK should go ahead and start</text>
  <text start="271.86" dur="6.48">making bilateral trade agreements with</text>
  <text start="274.98" dur="6.21">the US and many other countries because</text>
  <text start="278.34" dur="5.99">if they did do this they would have the</text>
  <text start="281.19" dur="7.02">upper hand but you need to remember that</text>
  <text start="284.33" dur="7.09">the central bank the government of the</text>
  <text start="288.21" dur="5.55">UK they&amp;#39;re working hand-in-hand so this</text>
  <text start="291.42" dur="3.84">is a little difficult right now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="293.76" dur="3.659">really surprised that they went ahead</text>
  <text start="295.26" dur="3.36">and they did this trade deal they should</text>
  <text start="297.419" dur="3.361">do many others</text>
  <text start="298.62" dur="4.86">and actually Trump tweeted out when may</text>
  <text start="300.78" dur="4.14">presented her brexit plan he said yeah</text>
  <text start="303.48" dur="3.84">this is not gonna benefit this is gonna</text>
  <text start="304.92" dur="4.56">hurt trade with the US this is actually</text>
  <text start="307.32" dur="4.74">leaning towards more of the EU than</text>
  <text start="309.48" dur="4.35">anything else and he was absolutely</text>
  <text start="312.06" dur="5.19">right and this is why Parliament in UK</text>
  <text start="313.83" dur="6.54">said no we&amp;#39;re not taking this deal here</text>
  <text start="317.25" dur="5.16">in the US we&amp;#39;re seeing the economy break</text>
  <text start="320.37" dur="4.62">down now we need to remember this is</text>
  <text start="322.41" dur="4.2">very different than what the corporate</text>
  <text start="324.99" dur="4.26">media the mainstream media is talking</text>
  <text start="326.61" dur="4.74">about the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="329.25" dur="5.55">playing it up because they do believe</text>
  <text start="331.35" dur="5.55">that the plan is to bring down the</text>
  <text start="334.8" dur="5.16">economy during the election time and</text>
  <text start="336.9" dur="4.71">blame it on Trump because this has been</text>
  <text start="339.96" dur="2.52">their plan and remember they reach</text>
  <text start="341.61" dur="2.1">strategized</text>
  <text start="342.48" dur="4.47">they had to come up with a different</text>
  <text start="343.71" dur="6.63">plan because Trump threw a curve ball</text>
  <text start="346.95" dur="6.09">into the whole planning of the economy</text>
  <text start="350.34" dur="5.4">and if we go back to 2008 we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="353.04" dur="5.4">watching studying looking at the</text>
  <text start="355.74" dur="5.01">unemployment numbers the GDP numbers the</text>
  <text start="358.44" dur="4.26">statistical numbers looking on Main</text>
  <text start="360.75" dur="4.47">Street to see how Main Street is</text>
  <text start="362.7" dur="3.57">actually doing and from everything that</text>
  <text start="365.22" dur="3.54">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at from all the</text>
  <text start="366.27" dur="5.85">different indicators we have noticed</text>
  <text start="368.76" dur="6.42">that this economy was built on an</text>
  <text start="372.12" dur="5.07">illusion and Trump right now is keeping</text>
  <text start="375.18" dur="3.6">the illusion alive now they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="377.19" dur="5.64">expect him to do this they didn&amp;#39;t expect</text>
  <text start="378.78" dur="6.51">him to understand or take control of the</text>
  <text start="382.83" dur="4.71">magic wand which controls pretty much</text>
  <text start="385.29" dur="5.01">everything remember this is not an open</text>
  <text start="387.54" dur="4.89">and free market the stock market is</text>
  <text start="390.3" dur="4.2">completely manipulated the interest</text>
  <text start="392.43" dur="4.65">rates are completely manipulated gold</text>
  <text start="394.5" dur="3.81">and silver completely manipulated and</text>
  <text start="397.08" dur="3.39">everything else that you&amp;#39;re seeing all</text>
  <text start="398.31" dur="5.7">these statistical numbers are completely</text>
  <text start="400.47" dur="5.04">manipulated but he understood that he</text>
  <text start="404.01" dur="4.08">was going to have to make the economy</text>
  <text start="405.51" dur="3.84">look incredible because they understood</text>
  <text start="408.09" dur="3.54">what they were trying to do and they</text>
  <text start="409.35" dur="4.2">were hoping that he&amp;#39;d be in office for a</text>
  <text start="411.63" dur="4.11">year and then all of a sudden they say</text>
  <text start="413.55" dur="4.14">okay the economy is falling apart and</text>
  <text start="415.74" dur="3.69">hopefully they destroy the economy and</text>
  <text start="417.69" dur="5.22">then get rid of them during that period</text>
  <text start="419.43" dur="5.58">of time but he flipped it on them and he</text>
  <text start="422.91" dur="3.87">made the economy great and he</text>
  <text start="425.01" dur="4.37">continually is out there telling</text>
  <text start="426.78" dur="5.109">everyone how great the economy is and</text>
  <text start="429.38" dur="4.219">the mainstream media there</text>
  <text start="431.889" dur="3.75">trying to fight this but it&amp;#39;s difficult</text>
  <text start="433.599" dur="3.6">for them to fight this because it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="435.639" dur="5.15">same statistical numbers they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="437.199" dur="6.09">using year after year after year and</text>
  <text start="440.789" dur="5.111">they can&amp;#39;t come out and tell everyone</text>
  <text start="443.289" dur="4.891">that these are all fake and this is the</text>
  <text start="445.9" dur="4.62">problem they&amp;#39;re having right now but the</text>
  <text start="448.18" dur="3.81">real economy the people&amp;#39;s economy we can</text>
  <text start="450.52" dur="4.019">see it&amp;#39;s completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="451.99" dur="4.38">Gymboree right now they declared</text>
  <text start="454.539" dur="3.481">bankruptcy they were hoping to get out</text>
  <text start="456.37" dur="4.919">of this but it looks like they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="458.02" dur="5.79">be closing 900 stores right now and it</text>
  <text start="461.289" dur="5.521">doesn&amp;#39;t look good and this is because</text>
  <text start="463.81" dur="5.219">the American person they&amp;#39;re barely</text>
  <text start="466.81" dur="5.94">getting by they&amp;#39;re barely making ends</text>
  <text start="469.029" dur="6.54">meet wages have not increased to keep up</text>
  <text start="472.75" dur="5.879">with the devaluing dollar we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="475.569" dur="6">inflation in many different areas I mean</text>
  <text start="478.629" dur="6.241">think about it we&amp;#39;re seeing inflation in</text>
  <text start="481.569" dur="5.041">health insurance we&amp;#39;re seeing inflation</text>
  <text start="484.87" dur="4.049">in the stock market we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="486.61" dur="6.779">inflation in the housing market we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="488.919" dur="8.37">seeing inflation in education think</text>
  <text start="493.389" dur="6.18">about why are we seeing inflation in all</text>
  <text start="497.289" dur="6.15">these areas we&amp;#39;re also seeing inflation</text>
  <text start="499.569" dur="7.231">in fresh foods why are we seeing</text>
  <text start="503.439" dur="4.861">inflation in these areas because if you</text>
  <text start="506.8" dur="3.989">really think about it and you break it</text>
  <text start="508.3" dur="3.03">down and you break out down the major</text>
  <text start="510.789" dur="3.05">ones</text>
  <text start="511.33" dur="7.1">same thing with automobiles automobiles</text>
  <text start="513.839" dur="8.591">housing education health insurance well</text>
  <text start="518.43" dur="5.739">Obama remember back then he made it</text>
  <text start="522.43" dur="3.599">mandatory that everyone have health</text>
  <text start="524.169" dur="3.271">insurance or you&amp;#39;re penalized so they</text>
  <text start="526.029" dur="3.99">tried to force everyone into health</text>
  <text start="527.44" dur="4.44">insurance and no matter what you did you</text>
  <text start="530.019" dur="5.911">had to pay for it especially if you were</text>
  <text start="531.88" dur="6.48">ill if you wanted to buy how a house you</text>
  <text start="535.93" dur="5.099">would have to take out a loan if you</text>
  <text start="538.36" dur="5.01">wanted to go to school college you would</text>
  <text start="541.029" dur="4.411">have to take out a loan if you wanted to</text>
  <text start="543.37" dur="6">buy a car you would have to take out a</text>
  <text start="545.44" dur="5.82">loan this was done on purpose because</text>
  <text start="549.37" dur="3.39">they knew they could stuff the inflation</text>
  <text start="551.26" dur="3.9">in these different areas and people</text>
  <text start="552.76" dur="4.59">would just take loans out and they would</text>
  <text start="555.16" dur="4.2">feel okay I don&amp;#39;t really notice it I</text>
  <text start="557.35" dur="3.299">have to pay this off I&amp;#39;ve been paying it</text>
  <text start="559.36" dur="4.14">off it&amp;#39;s not a big deal</text>
  <text start="560.649" dur="3.901">health insurance people noticed but they</text>
  <text start="563.5" dur="1.71">had to do it</text>
  <text start="564.55" dur="4.74">or</text>
  <text start="565.21" dur="6.86">they were penalized so they stuffed</text>
  <text start="569.29" dur="6.06">inflation into many different areas and</text>
  <text start="572.07" dur="6.34">right now as the economy breaks down and</text>
  <text start="575.35" dur="7.85">people aren&amp;#39;t making more money we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="578.41" dur="4.79">seeing the interest on all this debt</text>
  <text start="583.41" dur="9.01">continually rise so on the national debt</text>
  <text start="587.85" dur="10">right now there&amp;#39;s six hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="592.42" dur="8.4">billion dollars of interest that has to</text>
  <text start="597.85" dur="5.4">be paid think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="600.82" dur="6.11">it&amp;#39;s more than a half a trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="603.25" dur="6.57">of interest that&amp;#39;s an interest payment</text>
  <text start="606.93" dur="6.64">it&amp;#39;s not the total so one or two things</text>
  <text start="609.82" dur="6.48">have to happen here either all Americans</text>
  <text start="613.57" dur="4.2">make enough and the tax receipts that</text>
  <text start="616.3" dur="3.96">are coming into the government there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="617.77" dur="4.92">more than enough it&amp;#39;s paid off no</text>
  <text start="620.26" dur="4.8">problems the government has more than</text>
  <text start="622.69" dur="4.08">enough money to because the money has to</text>
  <text start="625.06" dur="3.78">go for that interest payment and to pay</text>
  <text start="626.77" dur="3.81">for everything else in the government</text>
  <text start="628.84" dur="5.04">even remember that just the interest</text>
  <text start="630.58" dur="5.16">payment part of it if it&amp;#39;s not enough</text>
  <text start="633.88" dur="4.02">the government has to borrow money and</text>
  <text start="635.74" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing today because</text>
  <text start="637.9" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s not enough and they have to</text>
  <text start="639.52" dur="4.23">continually borrow if they continually</text>
  <text start="641.47" dur="5.6">borrow what happened to the interest</text>
  <text start="643.75" dur="6.12">payment well we have to pay more if</text>
  <text start="647.07" dur="5.44">wages and salaries aren&amp;#39;t going up and</text>
  <text start="649.87" dur="4.94">the tax receipts aren&amp;#39;t coming in the</text>
  <text start="652.51" dur="5.04">government has to buy has to borrow more</text>
  <text start="654.81" dur="5.4">to pay a fault for that interest payment</text>
  <text start="657.55" dur="7.38">now the interest payment is even more</text>
  <text start="660.21" dur="8.32">this cycle cannot be sustained it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="664.93" dur="6.27">no-win situation and actually it reminds</text>
