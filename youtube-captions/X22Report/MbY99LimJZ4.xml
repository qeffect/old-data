  <text start="44.739" dur="4.741">screeching halt the collapse is</text>
  <text start="46.87" dur="5.22">inevitable let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="49.48" dur="6.09">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="52.09" dur="8.399">this holiday season we have seen that</text>
  <text start="55.57" dur="6.93">the people did not go out spend all of</text>
  <text start="60.489" dur="5.31">their money by as much as they possibly</text>
  <text start="62.5" dur="5.159">can to keep this economy alive it just</text>
  <text start="65.799" dur="5.581">didn&amp;#39;t happen and we&amp;#39;ve already had a</text>
  <text start="67.659" dur="4.981">casualty which was Macy&amp;#39;s hhgregg and</text>
  <text start="71.38" dur="4.23">many other stores that I mentioned</text>
  <text start="72.64" dur="6.659">before showing that their sales are very</text>
  <text start="75.61" dur="5.31">very weak and we know that part of it is</text>
  <text start="79.299" dur="4.561">that a lot of people are being laid off</text>
  <text start="80.92" dur="4.53">and they have part-time jobs they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="83.86" dur="3.06">have the same income coming in so they</text>
  <text start="85.45" dur="6.84">can&amp;#39;t go out and pay for the retail</text>
  <text start="86.92" dur="11.58">goods we&amp;#39;re also getting word that one</text>
  <text start="92.29" dur="9.63">in three Americans / they&amp;#39;re spending to</text>
  <text start="98.5" dur="6.78">afford Obamacare because Obamacare is so</text>
  <text start="101.92" dur="5.519">expensive that they need to take those</text>
  <text start="105.28" dur="5.1">funds and pay for their health premiums</text>
  <text start="107.439" dur="5.79">which takes away from them going out and</text>
  <text start="110.38" dur="4.19">spending on other things and i&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="113.229" dur="5.611">talking about going out and buying</text>
  <text start="114.57" dur="6.07">gigantic HD TVs or a brand new surround</text>
  <text start="118.84" dur="4.739">sound system or anything like that i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="120.64" dur="5.969">talking about food i&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="123.579" dur="5.941">clothing talking about heat i&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="126.609" dur="6.811">about the things that you need every day</text>
  <text start="129.52" dur="6.11">and right now the health insurers</text>
  <text start="133.42" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re in a panic mode because</text>
  <text start="135.63" dur="5.02">obamacare allowed large number of people</text>
  <text start="138.85" dur="3.92">to sign up for insurance after the</text>
  <text start="140.65" dur="4.35">deadlines in the last two years</text>
  <text start="142.77" dur="3.64">destabilizing the insurance markets and</text>
  <text start="145" dur="4.44">driving up premiums this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="146.41" dur="6.299">blaming it on which is completely</text>
  <text start="149.44" dur="5.4">ridiculous and since we&amp;#39;ve had this</text>
  <text start="152.709" dur="3.721">surge in cost and the reason why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="154.84" dur="3.53">having the premiums go up because</text>
  <text start="156.43" dur="5.55">there&amp;#39;s no more competition anymore</text>
  <text start="158.37" dur="6.07">because the insurance companies made an</text>
  <text start="161.98" dur="3.9">agreement with each other one</text>
  <text start="164.44" dur="6.75">they made the agreement with each other</text>
  <text start="165.88" dur="8.01">and everyone had to get insurance why do</text>
  <text start="171.19" dur="5.64">you need competition why would prices go</text>
  <text start="173.89" dur="5.31">down it makes no sense that it would and</text>
  <text start="176.83" dur="6.74">this is why we see premiums shooting up</text>
  <text start="179.2" dur="7.5">and right now the people who are on</text>
  <text start="183.57" dur="8.47">these plans are saying they can barely</text>
  <text start="186.7" dur="9.3">afford these plans and they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="192.04" dur="7.71">enough money left over to buy basic</text>
  <text start="196" dur="8.61">necessities such as food heat housing</text>
  <text start="199.75" dur="7.02">and it&amp;#39;s getting worse among the people</text>
  <text start="204.61" dur="4.98">with health insurance one in five twenty</text>
  <text start="206.77" dur="4.92">percent working-age americans report</text>
  <text start="209.59" dur="4.98">having problems paying medical bills in</text>
  <text start="211.69" dur="5.49">the past year that often caused serious</text>
  <text start="214.57" dur="5.37">financial challenges and changes in</text>
  <text start="217.18" dur="4.95">employment and lifestyles this is coming</text>
  <text start="219.94" dur="4.44">from the Kaiser Family Foundation New</text>
  <text start="222.13" dur="4.2">York Times survey as expected the</text>
  <text start="224.38" dur="5.16">situation is even worse among people who</text>
  <text start="226.33" dur="5.4">are uninsured half 53-percent faiths</text>
  <text start="229.54" dur="3.75">problems with medical bills bringing</text>
  <text start="231.73" dur="6.39">their overall overall total to</text>
  <text start="233.29" dur="9.169">twenty-six percent so did this</text>
  <text start="238.12" dur="7.47">legislation help the people in any way</text>
  <text start="242.459" dur="5.53">no actually it made it a lot worse this</text>
  <text start="245.59" dur="4.74">is why Congress and the president</text>
  <text start="247.989" dur="4.831">decided you know what I really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="250.33" dur="5.879">want the Affordable Care Act I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="252.82" dur="7.59">to keep what I have because I know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="256.209" dur="7.201">not good for the people and this is</text>
  <text start="260.41" dur="5.4">making it very hard for people to get by</text>
  <text start="263.41" dur="5.46">and especially those people who are</text>
  <text start="265.81" dur="4.62">losing their jobs who might be on Cobra</text>
  <text start="268.87" dur="4.14">for a little while who might be getting</text>
  <text start="270.43" dur="6.66">a severance pay package once that all</text>
  <text start="273.01" dur="7.2">runs out they have no alternative but to</text>
  <text start="277.09" dur="6.48">go on Obamacare and once they see the</text>
  <text start="280.21" dur="7.41">costs with their part-time job they will</text>
  <text start="283.57" dur="5.94">not be able to afford this and a lot of</text>
  <text start="287.62" dur="3.54">people who are trying to make the</text>
  <text start="289.51" dur="3.87">payments are dropping out because</text>
  <text start="291.16" dur="4.319">they&amp;#39;re saying it makes no sense I am</text>
  <text start="293.38" dur="4.23">paying seven eight nine hundred dollars</text>
  <text start="295.479" dur="2.821">a month I have a five ten thousand</text>
  <text start="297.61" dur="4.2">dollar deducted</text>
  <text start="298.3" dur="5.399">well what am I paying for because every</text>
  <text start="301.81" dur="6.09">time I go to the doctor I&amp;#39;m paying out</text>
  <text start="303.699" dur="6.391">of my pocket so this was not a benefit</text>
  <text start="307.9" dur="7.53">to the people whatsoever it actually</text>
  <text start="310.09" dur="9.56">made the situation worse now we realize</text>
  <text start="315.43" dur="8.04">that the auto industry there is one</text>
  <text start="319.65" dur="6.13">gigantic bubble ready to pop there have</text>
  <text start="323.47" dur="5.879">been 17 million new vehicles which were</text>
  <text start="325.78" dur="5.849">sold in 2015 this is the highest it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="329.349" dur="3.511">ever been in the United States and of</text>
  <text start="331.629" dur="4.141">course the media is out there saying</text>
  <text start="332.86" dur="6.359">whoa record sales this is an improvement</text>
  <text start="335.77" dur="6.51">this is fantastic but then you look and</text>
  <text start="339.219" dur="6.091">you see who is actually purchase</text>
  <text start="342.28" dur="6.389">purchasing these cars you realize it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="345.31" dur="6.889">all on credit and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="348.669" dur="6.72">right now is that this auto loan</text>
  <text start="352.199" dur="5.171">gigantic bubble that they&amp;#39;ve created is</text>
  <text start="355.389" dur="4.43">going to pop actually they&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="357.37" dur="8.599">same thing they did as in real estate</text>
  <text start="359.819" dur="8.921">they accepted the subprime creditors</text>
  <text start="365.969" dur="5.711">they kept the interest rates very very</text>
  <text start="368.74" dur="5.579">low and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="371.68" dur="6.93">feeding the Machine by bringing these</text>
  <text start="374.319" dur="10.171">people in and we&amp;#39;re seeing the same</text>
  <text start="378.61" dur="9.45">exact thing occur now right now what</text>
  <text start="384.49" dur="8">we&amp;#39;re seeing is in order to generate</text>
  <text start="388.06" dur="8.49">more vehicle purchases these companies</text>
  <text start="392.49" dur="6.85">created incentives for consumers you</text>
  <text start="396.55" dur="6.03">know hard to resist incentives like no</text>
  <text start="399.34" dur="5.539">money down you know loans you don&amp;#39;t to</text>
  <text start="402.58" dur="6.209">make a payment for a couple of months</text>
  <text start="404.879" dur="5.711">almost twenty percent of all auto loans</text>
  <text start="408.789" dur="6.99">are given to individuals with credit</text>
  <text start="410.59" dur="7.169">scores below 620 but the bubble has not</text>
  <text start="415.779" dur="4.621">popped yet but what are we seeing right</text>
  <text start="417.759" dur="5.101">now well we&amp;#39;re seeing delinquencies on</text>
  <text start="420.4" dur="6.15">car loans have increased by a hundred</text>
  <text start="422.86" dur="6.119">and twenty percent from just over one</text>
  <text start="426.55" dur="4.93">percent in twenty ten to two point two</text>
  <text start="428.979" dur="7.961">six two percent</text>
  <text start="431.48" dur="7.65">20-14 that&amp;#39;s 2.6 2% in 2014 according to</text>
  <text start="436.94" dur="4.79">the Center for Responsible Lending one</text>
  <text start="439.13" dur="7.23">in every six title loan borrower is</text>
  <text start="441.73" dur="8.85">already facing repossession fees so we</text>
  <text start="446.36" dur="8.07">are already seeing this bubble</text>
  <text start="450.58" dur="7.51">completely starting to implode on itself</text>
  <text start="454.43" dur="6.68">and it&amp;#39;s going to get worse as time goes</text>
  <text start="458.09" dur="5.79">on it is not going to get better and</text>
  <text start="461.11" dur="6.52">what&amp;#39;s happening right now there is less</text>
  <text start="463.88" dur="5.88">and less people purchasing cars and the</text>
  <text start="467.63" dur="6.39">auto manufacturers are now channel</text>
  <text start="469.76" dur="8.13">stuffing the Lots the dealers have tons</text>
  <text start="474.02" dur="6.81">of cars and we&amp;#39;re seeing the exact same</text>
  <text start="477.89" dur="8.19">thing that we saw back in 2007 going</text>
  <text start="480.83" dur="7.65">into 2008 so basically we&amp;#39;re repeating</text>
  <text start="486.08" dur="4.53">everything that we&amp;#39;ve done not we but</text>
  <text start="488.48" dur="4.77">them what they&amp;#39;ve done back in two</text>
  <text start="490.61" dur="5.97">thousand eight and this time the problem</text>
  <text start="493.25" dur="5.58">is much worse because the unemployment</text>
  <text start="496.58" dur="5.34">is not five percent which we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="498.83" dur="4.98">closer to thirty percent we know most of</text>
  <text start="501.92" dur="5.22">these people have part-time jobs a lot</text>
  <text start="503.81" dur="5.34">of people are out of the workforce a lot</text>
  <text start="507.14" dur="5.52">of people lost their wealth during the</text>
  <text start="509.15" dur="5.93">last great recession a lot of people</text>
  <text start="512.66" dur="6.39">have no savings a lot of people are on</text>
  <text start="515.08" dur="6.91">government assistance so this time the</text>
  <text start="519.05" dur="5.94">problem is much much worse rail traffic</text>
  <text start="521.99" dur="6.27">once again has plunged to recessionary</text>
  <text start="524.99" dur="7.08">levels us railroad cargo and 2015</text>
  <text start="528.26" dur="5.88">dropped the most in six years and 2016</text>
  <text start="532.07" dur="4.23">does not look any better actually it</text>
  <text start="534.14" dur="4.44">looks a lot worse which they are showing</text>
  <text start="536.3" dur="6.45">predictions that the rail traffic is</text>
  <text start="538.58" dur="6.36">going to continually decline and right</text>
  <text start="542.75" dur="4.44">now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the rail</text>
  <text start="544.94" dur="4.38">traffic is showing and the trucking</text>
  <text start="547.19" dur="5.13">traffic is showing that we are headed</text>
  <text start="549.32" dur="5.19">into a complete collapse of the system</text>
  <text start="552.32" dur="3.54">in December the total volume dropped by</text>
  <text start="554.51" dur="6.18">eight point nine percent year-over-year</text>
  <text start="555.86" dur="7.05">and we are seeing that the bulk</text>
  <text start="560.69" dur="5.06">commodities auto and things like that</text>
  <text start="562.91" dur="6.38">car loads are plunging by 50</text>
  <text start="565.75" dur="7.92">six percent so what are the railroad is</text>
  <text start="569.29" dur="7.14">doing right now to kind of combat what</text>
  <text start="573.67" dur="4.43">is happening right now well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="576.43" dur="5.69">going to be reducing their head count</text>
  <text start="578.1" dur="7">shrimp trimming of capital spending and</text>
  <text start="582.12" dur="6.87">we&amp;#39;re going to see more layoffs from all</text>
  <text start="585.1" dur="8.85">this just like with every single company</text>
  <text start="588.99" dur="8.47">now the Baltic Dry Index has reached</text>
  <text start="593.95" dur="8.81">all-time new lows it is down 14 points</text>
  <text start="597.46" dur="9.75">to 415 and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="602.76" dur="7.86">that the North Atlantic has little or no</text>
  <text start="607.21" dur="6.78">cargo ships traveling in its waters</text>
  <text start="610.62" dur="6.73">instead they are anchored and unmoving</text>
  <text start="613.99" dur="7.32">and empty and if you look on marine</text>
  <text start="617.35" dur="6.69">traffic calm you will see that ships are</text>
  <text start="621.31" dur="6.56">not moving anywhere they&amp;#39;re all in the</text>
  <text start="624.04" dur="10.049">ports or they&amp;#39;re anchored out at sea</text>
  <text start="627.87" dur="7.99">there is no shipping right now and this</text>
  <text start="634.089" dur="6.571">is completely catastrophic for World</text>
  <text start="635.86" dur="6.39">Trade and if there are ships just moving</text>
  <text start="640.66" dur="4.14">around a little bit it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="642.25" dur="5.7">catastrophic because the Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="644.8" dur="4.92">Index is continually dropping it is not</text>
  <text start="647.95" dur="4.86">improving whatsoever and since the</text>
  <text start="649.72" dur="6.27">Baltic Dry Index is falling factories</text>
  <text start="652.81" dur="6.54">aren&amp;#39;t buying and retailers aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="655.99" dur="6.84">stocking the ratio of inventory to sales</text>
  <text start="659.35" dur="6.93">in the u.s. is an indicator of all of</text>
  <text start="662.83" dur="6.24">this the last time the ratio was this</text>
  <text start="666.28" dur="8.79">high was during the Great Recession in</text>
  <text start="669.07" dur="9.68">2008 and this shows us that something is</text>
  <text start="675.07" dur="7.92">terribly wrong in the global economy and</text>
  <text start="678.75" dur="5.94">we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on the economy the</text>
  <text start="682.99" dur="6.24">global economy for quite a while</text>
  <text start="684.69" dur="7.09">bringing us up to this point and we as</text>
  <text start="689.23" dur="4.71">we report on this have not seen any</text>
  <text start="691.78" dur="4.29">improvement once we&amp;#39;re actually we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="693.94" dur="4.05">only seen the economy get worse and</text>
  <text start="696.07" dur="3.48">worse even though they tell us that GDP</text>
  <text start="697.99" dur="3.42">numbers are looking bad</text>
  <text start="699.55" dur="3.57">or the unemployment numbers are looking</text>
  <text start="701.41" dur="4.98">better this holiday season is going to</text>
  <text start="703.12" dur="6.659">be fantastic and it all turns out to be</text>
  <text start="706.39" dur="5.79">a lie because when you cut through the</text>
  <text start="709.779" dur="5.731">manipulated numbers and you get to the</text>
  <text start="712.18" dur="6.779">meat of it all you see that unemployment</text>
  <text start="715.51" dur="6.36">was manipulated they don&amp;#39;t count those</text>
  <text start="718.959" dur="5.491">people who can&amp;#39;t find jobs the jobs that</text>
  <text start="721.87" dur="5.909">are found are part-time jobs they count</text>
  <text start="724.45" dur="6.05">them once twice three times and they</text>
  <text start="727.779" dur="6.511">haven&amp;#39;t added any jobs to the economy</text>
  <text start="730.5" dur="6.16">whatsoever same thing with GDP they</text>
  <text start="734.29" dur="4.919">stuff GDP with inventory they use</text>
  <text start="736.66" dur="5.16">Obamacare they went back to nineteen</text>
  <text start="739.209" dur="4.651">twenty-nine included research and</text>
  <text start="741.82" dur="5.72">development and recalculate the GDP up</text>
  <text start="743.86" dur="8.76">to the present time they are completely</text>
  <text start="747.54" dur="7.359">manipulating everything and we see that</text>
  <text start="752.62" dur="6.38">it is getting worse and worse as time</text>
  <text start="754.899" dur="8.821">goes on David Morgan is reporting that</text>
  <text start="759" dur="8.02">there&amp;#39;s something big going on among</text>
  <text start="763.72" dur="7.8">banks among countries among central</text>

  <text start="794.829" dur="8.461">is going on here and we know what that</text>
  <text start="798.07" dur="9.66">is we know the paper Fiat system that we</text>
  <text start="803.29" dur="6.93">are on today is collapsing we know the</text>

  <text start="856.839" dur="7.591">being done on purpose because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="860.5" dur="6.6">seeing right now is the economy shaking</text>

  <text start="873.16" dur="4.56">the Middle East as more and more</text>
  <text start="876.279" dur="4.021">countries get away from the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="877.72" dur="5.909">the situation is going to get worse and</text>
  <text start="880.3" dur="7.019">worse as time goes on and this reminds</text>
  <text start="883.629" dur="5.911">me of like dynamite when you light the</text>
  <text start="887.319" dur="3.841">fuse and the fuse is very very long and</text>
  <text start="889.54" dur="3.81">they say when is this going to go when</text>
  <text start="891.16" dur="4.469">is this going to go and it keeps going</text>
  <text start="893.35" dur="3.81">the fuse keeps going and this is what</text>
  <text start="895.629" dur="3.121">it&amp;#39;s like and as it gets closer and</text>
  <text start="897.16" dur="4.77">closer you know you start to sweat</text>
  <text start="898.75" dur="5.939">things get worse it gets the things</text>
  <text start="901.93" dur="5.399">completely fall apart people start</text>
  <text start="904.689" dur="5.851">running people start doing other things</text>
  <text start="907.329" dur="5.43">to prepare for what is coming but the</text>
  <text start="910.54" dur="3.599">fuse keeps going we are getting to the</text>
  <text start="912.759" dur="5.601">point where we&amp;#39;re getting closer and</text>
  <text start="914.139" dur="7.291">closer to the big boom and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="918.36" dur="6.599">all of it happened around us right now</text>
  <text start="921.43" dur="6.36">and everything that we talked about from</text>
  <text start="924.959" dur="4.151">2008 going forward actually if you</text>
  <text start="927.79" dur="3.659">really go back to nineteen thirteen but</text>
  <text start="929.11" dur="6.089">let&amp;#39;s just go to 2008 going forward</text>
  <text start="931.449" dur="8.64">we&amp;#39;ve been documenting how this is</text>
  <text start="935.199" dur="8.551">evolving how it&amp;#39;s in unfolding so we</text>
  <text start="940.089" dur="5.911">understand how we got here because you</text>
  <text start="943.75" dur="3.48">know the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="946" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re going to be making up this</text>
  <text start="947.23" dur="5.339">incredible story remember the stories</text>
  <text start="949.18" dur="5.61">they may made up during 2008 where it</text>
  <text start="952.569" dur="5.221">was the people&amp;#39;s fault the bankers had</text>
  <text start="954.79" dur="5.01">nothing to do with it too big to fail we</text>
  <text start="957.79" dur="3.96">can&amp;#39;t go after them we don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="959.8" dur="3.719">happened we weren&amp;#39;t forecasting a</text>
  <text start="961.75" dur="3.959">recession it just happened out of thin</text>
  <text start="963.519" dur="3.451">air well they&amp;#39;re going to be doing the</text>
  <text start="965.709" dur="2.88">same exact thing but</text>
  <text start="966.97" dur="3.539">I&amp;#39;m going to be blaming it on another</text>
  <text start="968.589" dur="5.31">group another country they learned their</text>
  <text start="970.509" dur="5.37">lesson they need a cover story and it</text>
  <text start="973.899" dur="3.93">has to be big it has to be something</text>
  <text start="975.879" dur="5.4">where they can really explain it away</text>
  <text start="977.829" dur="5.851">and this is why you see all the prepper</text>
  <text start="981.279" dur="4.68">all this preparation to blame it on a</text>
  <text start="983.68" dur="5.25">cyber attack to blame it on an event to</text>
