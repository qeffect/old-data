  <text start="35.54" dur="6.03">episode 1042 and today&amp;#39;s date is August</text>
  <text start="38.75" dur="5.52">7 2016 and the thought of the episode is</text>
  <text start="41.57" dur="4.739">the current economic collapse news brief</text>
  <text start="44.27" dur="5.16">let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="46.309" dur="5.851">collapse news them on Friday we got this</text>
  <text start="49.43" dur="4.83">incredible jobs report came out of</text>
  <text start="52.16" dur="4.89">nowhere all of a sudden everyone is</text>
  <text start="54.26" dur="4.77">employed and I did make it a prediction</text>
  <text start="57.05" dur="3.66">I don&amp;#39;t like making predictions I look I</text>
  <text start="59.03" dur="3.63">like looking at economic indicators</text>
  <text start="60.71" dur="4.049">political geopolitical indicators</text>
  <text start="62.66" dur="3.78">putting all the information together and</text>
  <text start="64.759" dur="3.811">try to figure out what is about to</text>
  <text start="66.44" dur="4.319">happen now sometimes it hits sometimes</text>
  <text start="68.57" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s off a little bit the timing is not</text>
  <text start="70.759" dur="5.64">always right but we get very very close</text>
  <text start="73.25" dur="5.25">to what is happening and we see that the</text>
  <text start="76.399" dur="4.021">unemployment rate it remained at four</text>
  <text start="78.5" dur="4.2">point nine percent now as we get closer</text>
  <text start="80.42" dur="3.93">and closer to the elections normally</text>
  <text start="82.7" dur="3.51">what happens is they want the economy to</text>
  <text start="84.35" dur="4.29">look really really like it&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="86.21" dur="3.9">really really well so what they&amp;#39;re most</text>
  <text start="88.64" dur="3.21">likely going to do because we see their</text>
  <text start="90.11" dur="3">pre-staging this is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="91.85" dur="2.699">bring down the unemployment rate and I</text>
  <text start="93.11" dur="3.6">don&amp;#39;t have to drop it by quite a bit to</text>
  <text start="94.549" dur="4.14">really get the attention of the American</text>
  <text start="96.71" dur="4.769">people and that&amp;#39;s why I made that</text>
  <text start="98.689" dur="5.04">prediction and we also saw that there</text>
  <text start="101.479" dur="4.32">were a lot of anomalies with the jobs</text>
  <text start="103.729" dur="5.491">report a lot of people aren&amp;#39;t working</text>
  <text start="105.799" dur="6.75">and the Census Bureau they&amp;#39;ve estimated</text>
  <text start="109.22" dur="6.149">that the u.s. population on August fifth</text>
  <text start="112.549" dur="4.68">2016 was around three hundred and twenty</text>
  <text start="115.369" dur="4.441">four point one seven million people</text>
  <text start="117.229" dur="4.741">that&amp;#39;s up from about three hundred and</text>
  <text start="119.81" dur="5.699">eight point seven six million in April</text>
  <text start="121.97" dur="6.509">of 2010 and that&amp;#39;s since the Great</text>
  <text start="125.509" dur="7.681">Recession so the u.s. population it has</text>
  <text start="128.479" dur="6.51">grown by 15.4 million now everyone ages</text>
  <text start="133.19" dur="5.46">so the young ones move into the labor</text>
  <text start="134.989" dur="6.03">force but the baby boomers they are</text>
  <text start="138.65" dur="5.28">still working they don&amp;#39;t feel like</text>
  <text start="141.019" dur="6.091">retiring there&amp;#39;s no interest on their</text>
  <text start="143.93" dur="5.19">money and things are getting more and</text>
  <text start="147.11" dur="6.15">more expensive so they continue to work</text>
  <text start="149.12" dur="7.17">in twenty ten twenty four percent of the</text>
  <text start="153.26" dur="5.309">people were under 18 that was 74 million</text>
  <text start="156.29" dur="6.27">people millions of them have since moved</text>
  <text start="158.569" dur="5.341">into the labor force in april 2010 they</text>
  <text start="162.56" dur="6.36">were a hundred and thirty</text>
  <text start="163.91" dur="7.62">point 1 million non-farm payrolls in the</text>
  <text start="168.92" dur="4.41">jobs report that came out in July there</text>
  <text start="171.53" dur="7.74">were a hundred and forty four point four</text>
  <text start="173.33" dur="8.69">million so 14.3 million jobs have been</text>
  <text start="179.27" dur="5.85">added to the economy over the timespan</text>
  <text start="182.02" dur="6.97">even as the total population has grown</text>
  <text start="185.12" dur="6.71">by 15.4 million so that&amp;#39;s not working</text>
  <text start="188.99" dur="7.98">out very well at all because we are off</text>
  <text start="191.83" dur="7.63">by almost a million people because to</text>
  <text start="196.97" dur="3.99">keep the economy healthy they have to</text>
  <text start="199.46" dur="4.29">continually add about two hundred and</text>
  <text start="200.96" dur="4.86">five thousand jobs and if we break this</text>
  <text start="203.75" dur="3.81">down even further these jobs are not</text>
  <text start="205.82" dur="4.62">high paying jobs these are part-time</text>
  <text start="207.56" dur="5.13">jobs and we&amp;#39;re not even counting all</text>
  <text start="210.44" dur="6.11">those individuals that just can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="212.69" dur="9.12">work so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="216.55" dur="7.36">the bureau of labor statistics they try</text>
  <text start="221.81" dur="4.41">to it they try to capture this dismal</text>
  <text start="223.91" dur="4.77">condition with employment population</text>
  <text start="226.22" dur="6.03">ratio and when we look at the employment</text>
  <text start="228.68" dur="6.66">population ratio since 2000 we see we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="232.25" dur="7.49">at its lowest point since the Great</text>
  <text start="235.34" dur="8.76">Recession it is not improved whatsoever</text>
  <text start="239.74" dur="6.58">maybe a little hair that&amp;#39;s it but when</text>
  <text start="244.1" dur="8.28">we look at this it is a complete</text>
  <text start="246.32" dur="7.44">disaster and going forward there is</text>
  <text start="252.38" dur="3.06">going to be no improvement because</text>
  <text start="253.76" dur="4.05">what&amp;#39;s happening is more and more</text>
  <text start="255.44" dur="6">corporations they&amp;#39;re already calling for</text>
  <text start="257.81" dur="6.45">layoffs and as we go through this year</text>
  <text start="261.44" dur="6.81">to the next year it&amp;#39;s just going to get</text>
  <text start="264.26" dur="6.42">worse so despite the reappearance of</text>
  <text start="268.25" dur="5.58">millions of jobs since the Great</text>
  <text start="270.68" dur="8.34">Recession the employment ratio didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="273.83" dur="7.2">improve to any meaningful extent at all</text>
  <text start="279.02" dur="6.75">we have little pop-ups here and there</text>
  <text start="281.03" dur="8.13">but overall we&amp;#39;re dead in the water now</text>
  <text start="285.77" dur="6.56">Bank of America they&amp;#39;ve come out saying</text>
  <text start="289.16" dur="8.64">that we are in trouble because the</text>
  <text start="292.33" dur="8.559">central bank&amp;#39;s they are compromising the</text>
  <text start="297.8" dur="5.97">global bond market and is becoming very</text>
  <text start="300.889" dur="5.791">dangerous were entering an area with no</text>
  <text start="303.77" dur="6.81">precedent and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="306.68" dur="10.049">now is that the global central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="310.58" dur="8.369">they are continually using QE and it has</text>
  <text start="316.729" dur="8.22">hit a record of a hundred and eighty</text>
  <text start="318.949" dur="8.821">billion per month and worst of all they</text>
  <text start="324.949" dur="7.291">are doubling redoubling down at every</text>
  <text start="327.77" dur="7.859">occasion and what this tells us is that</text>
  <text start="332.24" dur="5.88">the economy cannot sustain itself they</text>
  <text start="335.629" dur="6.421">have to continually use the creation of</text>
  <text start="338.12" dur="6.96">funds to purchase the toxic real estate</text>
  <text start="342.05" dur="5.489">to purchase corporate bonds to purchase</text>
  <text start="345.08" dur="4.589">Treasury bonds and all they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="347.539" dur="5.071">they&amp;#39;re passing the baton the Fed is</text>
  <text start="349.669" dur="7.47">creating QE the Bank of Japan is</text>
  <text start="352.61" dur="6.869">creating QE the ECB is using QE and they</text>
  <text start="357.139" dur="5.881">can continually rotate this all around</text>
  <text start="359.479" dur="5.461">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="363.02" dur="4.47">not seeing any type of improvement</text>
  <text start="364.94" dur="5.159">actually the economy is deteriorating as</text>
  <text start="367.49" dur="5.84">we move as we&amp;#39;ve been looking at every</text>
  <text start="370.099" dur="5.31">single report previous to this one and</text>
  <text start="373.33" dur="5.519">when we look at all the economic</text>
  <text start="375.409" dur="7.711">indicators like retail GDP housing</text>
  <text start="378.849" dur="7.331">unemployment and everything else we see</text>
  <text start="383.12" dur="5.97">that things are dramatically declining</text>
  <text start="386.18" dur="4.44">and we&amp;#39;re heading into an area where</text>
  <text start="389.09" dur="5.66">things are going to accelerate to the</text>
  <text start="390.62" dur="6.9">downside now the United States released</text>
  <text start="394.75" dur="6.52">their redacted copy of the so-called</text>
  <text start="397.52" dur="7.35">drone strike playbook which outlines US</text>
  <text start="401.27" dur="5.97">policies on unmanned aerial vehicles the</text>
  <text start="404.87" dur="5.099">redacted 18-page version of the 2013</text>
  <text start="407.24" dur="5.37">president policy guidance was made</text>
  <text start="409.969" dur="4.621">public now you have to remember the</text>
  <text start="412.61" dur="5.25">American Civil Liberties Union they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="414.59" dur="5.97">been trying to get this document for</text>
  <text start="417.86" dur="4.5">over a year they filed a lawsuit to get</text>
  <text start="420.56" dur="4.109">this document and when we look at this</text>
  <text start="422.36" dur="5.039">document we see the following that the</text>
  <text start="424.669" dur="5.22">presidential policy guidelines also</text>
  <text start="427.399" dur="3.991">seeks a near certainty reassurance that</text>
  <text start="429.889" dur="3.991">civilians will not</text>
  <text start="431.39" dur="3.9">killed on or injured while hunting down</text>
  <text start="433.88" dur="4.02">a specific target the policy however</text>
  <text start="435.29" dur="5.1">never really mentions the term civilian</text>
  <text start="437.9" dur="4.23">but rather a noncombatant which</text>
  <text start="440.39" dur="4.5">according to the document excludes those</text>
  <text start="442.13" dur="5.61">individuals who are targetable in the</text>
  <text start="444.89" dur="4.5">exercise of national self-defense the</text>
  <text start="447.74" dur="4.44">playbook also stipulates that all</text>
  <text start="449.39" dur="5.49">operational plans shall be presented to</text>
  <text start="452.18" dur="5.34">the president for decision when there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="454.88" dur="4.95">a lack of consensus or the designated</text>
  <text start="457.52" dur="3.6">target is a US citizen so the president</text>
  <text start="459.83" dur="2.73">will make the decision so those</text>
  <text start="461.12" dur="3.96">individuals those civilians that are</text>
  <text start="462.56" dur="6.77">killed US citizens that are killed the</text>
  <text start="465.08" dur="6.93">President did make those decisions now</text>
  <text start="469.33" dur="4.92">this entire disclosure this redacted</text>
  <text start="472.01" dur="4.74">document doesn&amp;#39;t tell the entire story</text>
  <text start="474.25" dur="5.17">because we can see there are still some</text>
  <text start="476.75" dur="4.38">parts of it that we cannot read we still</text>
  <text start="479.42" dur="3.27">know extremely little about the</text>
  <text start="481.13" dur="4.08">standards that would govern signature</text>
  <text start="482.69" dur="4.41">strikes and so-called rescuer strikes</text>
  <text start="485.21" dur="5.19">which have involved potentially unlawful</text>
  <text start="487.1" dur="5.34">killings the document also notes that in</text>
  <text start="490.4" dur="3.78">no event will additional detainees be</text>
  <text start="492.44" dur="4.8">brought to the detention facilities at</text>
  <text start="494.18" dur="4.8">the Quetta naama bay naval base so we</text>
  <text start="497.24" dur="4.11">can see we&amp;#39;re getting the first parts of</text>
  <text start="498.98" dur="4.59">this a lot of it redacted and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="501.35" dur="3.9">still more investigation going on to</text>
  <text start="503.57" dur="4.53">this drone policy and you have to</text>
  <text start="505.25" dur="5.22">remember the reason why they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="508.1" dur="4.05">these drone strikes and I&amp;#39;ve said this</text>
  <text start="510.47" dur="3.87">before but those people who are new who</text>
  <text start="512.15" dur="5.73">don&amp;#39;t understand because you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="514.34" dur="5.34">gone back to the reports those people</text>
  <text start="517.88" dur="5.37">inside the country that they call al</text>
  <text start="519.68" dur="6.93">Qaeda those are the people who are</text>
  <text start="523.25" dur="5.1">against the puppet governments in those</text>
  <text start="526.61" dur="4.62">countries now the puppet governments are</text>
  <text start="528.35" dur="4.77">put into place by the US government so</text>
  <text start="531.23" dur="6.02">what has happened is the United States</text>
  <text start="533.12" dur="7.56">uses al Qaeda to go into these countries</text>
  <text start="537.25" dur="5.29">to stir things up and they say Oh al</text>
  <text start="540.68" dur="4.29">Qaeda is in this country we have to go</text>
  <text start="542.54" dur="5.28">in there there&amp;#39;s terrorism and they</text>
  <text start="544.97" dur="5.34">remove the puppet government once the</text>
  <text start="547.82" dur="5.64">puppet government is removed everything</text>
  <text start="550.31" dur="4.98">switches those people who are against</text>
  <text start="553.46" dur="4.83">the new government they are called</text>
  <text start="555.29" dur="6.36">terrorists al Qaeda by doing this they</text>
  <text start="558.29" dur="6.07">can use the authorization for war which</text>
  <text start="561.65" dur="6.46">allows them to use drone strikes again</text>
  <text start="564.36" dur="6.36">al-qaeda operatives we&amp;#39;ve seen this in</text>
  <text start="568.11" dur="6.24">Iraq we&amp;#39;ve seen this in Lebanon we seen</text>
  <text start="570.72" dur="5.67">this in Yemen we&amp;#39;ve seen this in Syria</text>
  <text start="574.35" dur="4.979">where they&amp;#39;re using al-qaeda al-nusrah</text>
  <text start="576.39" dur="5.939">the Islamic state to topple the Assad</text>
  <text start="579.329" dur="5.791">government and if they ever did remove</text>
  <text start="582.329" dur="4.771">Assad all those individuals that are</text>
  <text start="585.12" dur="3.24">against the new puppet government they</text>
  <text start="587.1" dur="3.33">would be called terrace we saw this in</text>
  <text start="588.36" dur="3.659">Ukraine once the coup d&amp;#39;etat was</text>
  <text start="590.43" dur="3.899">complete those people in the</text>
  <text start="592.019" dur="5.25">southeastern region Crimea they were all</text>
  <text start="594.329" dur="5.611">considered terrorists at the time now</text>
  <text start="597.269" dur="4.681">North Korea they have accused Washington</text>
  <text start="599.94" dur="4.11">of planning a pre-emptive nuclear strike</text>
  <text start="601.95" dur="5.069">because you have to remember we reported</text>
  <text start="604.05" dur="5.19">on this in Guam they replaced the b-52</text>
  <text start="607.019" dur="3.931">bombers with b1 bombers and of course</text>
  <text start="609.24" dur="5.339">North Korea is looking at this saying</text>
  <text start="610.95" dur="7.379">this is a staging area where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="614.579" dur="7.021">going to use these bombers later on once</text>
  <text start="618.329" dur="5.19">the war starts and of course it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="621.6" dur="3.9">being used to provoke North Korea and we</text>
  <text start="623.519" dur="4.471">can see they want North Korea to take</text>
  <text start="625.5" dur="5.519">the next step and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="627.99" dur="5.73">continually pushing we see Japan is</text>
  <text start="631.019" dur="5.971">protesting against the Chinese surface</text>
  <text start="633.72" dur="5.97">radar which is found on a grant gas</text>
  <text start="636.99" dur="7.32">drilling platform near the South China</text>
  <text start="639.69" dur="9.509">Sea and we have to think about this for</text>
  <text start="644.31" dur="10.32">a second Japan found radar systems on a</text>
  <text start="649.199" dur="9.031">gas drilling platform now the radars</text>
  <text start="654.63" dur="6.99">that they found they&amp;#39;re not powerful</text>
  <text start="658.23" dur="6.66">enough to be used at for military</text>
  <text start="661.62" dur="6.32">purposes but it is designed to detect</text>
  <text start="664.89" dur="7.439">ships now why would gas drilling</text>
  <text start="667.94" dur="6.639">platforms have radars well they use them</text>
  <text start="672.329" dur="5.281">for security they want to know what</text>
  <text start="674.579" dur="7.861">ships are coming close to them and most</text>
  <text start="677.61" dur="8.18">of the gas drilling platforms have these</text>
  <text start="682.44" dur="7.29">radar systems they&amp;#39;re just using this as</text>
  <text start="685.79" dur="6.609">propaganda to provoke China to make the</text>
  <text start="689.73" dur="7.02">world think that china is getting ready</text>
  <text start="692.399" dur="5.821">for war now we know the US and Obama has</text>
  <text start="696.75" dur="5">mentioned it that he&amp;#39;s encircling</text>
  <text start="698.22" dur="6.51">China and we know that there was the</text>

  <text start="718.02" dur="4.89">study came out which was commissioned by</text>
  <text start="721.11" dur="3.93">the US Army that goes through</text>
  <text start="722.91" dur="5.28">preparations for war against China</text>
  <text start="725.04" dur="5.01">because as we know China refused to</text>
  <text start="728.19" dur="5.01">comply with the ruling from The Hague</text>
  <text start="730.05" dur="6.65">arbitration which of course has no</text>
  <text start="733.2" dur="6.96">countries Asian countries involved in</text>
  <text start="736.7" dur="6.22">that court system now a new study by the</text>
  <text start="740.16" dur="6.09">RAND Corporation tiled war with China</text>
  <text start="742.92" dur="7.79">thinking through the unthinkable that</text>
  <text start="746.25" dur="8.84">was commissioned through the US Army and</text>
  <text start="750.71" dur="7.74">what they&amp;#39;re preparing for is a major</text>
  <text start="755.09" dur="6.97">war with China and you have to remember</text>
  <text start="758.45" dur="6.13">the u.s. is not a signatory of the law</text>
  <text start="762.06" dur="4.95">of the sea treaty under which the</text>
  <text start="764.58" dur="5.16">territorial dispute was purportedly</text>
  <text start="767.01" dur="5.55">decided by The Hague and we can see</text>
  <text start="769.74" dur="5.16">right now they&amp;#39;re using this to provoke</text>
  <text start="772.56" dur="5.52">China the RAND Corporation in the US</text>
  <text start="774.9" dur="5.22">Army have already laid out the details</text>
  <text start="778.08" dur="4.74">and how they want this thing to move</text>
  <text start="780.12" dur="7.88">forward and it&amp;#39;s all about provoking</text>
  <text start="782.82" dur="7.68">another war we see that a US delegation</text>
  <text start="788" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;ll be visiting Turkey next week to</text>
  <text start="790.5" dur="6.48">discuss the extradition of guellen--</text>
  <text start="793.76" dur="6.25">IRDA one believes that Fethullah Gulen</text>
  <text start="796.98" dur="4.98">is behind this entire thing and he is</text>
  <text start="800.01" dur="6">part of the puzzle the united states</text>
  <text start="801.96" dur="7.53">joined with Gulen he&amp;#39;s a CIA up and we</text>
  <text start="806.01" dur="6.66">can see right now this whole entire coup</text>
  <text start="809.49" dur="7.31">that occurred in Turkey was most likely</text>
  <text start="812.67" dur="7.32">to assist with the offensive in Aleppo</text>
  <text start="816.8" dur="5.29">to get the Islamic state al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="819.99" dur="3.09">al-nusrah moderate rebels whatever you</text>
  <text start="822.09" dur="3.03">want to call them these terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="823.08" dur="3.87">morph back and forth into each other</text>
  <text start="825.12" dur="4.08">because the United States their back is</text>
  <text start="826.95" dur="4.92">against the wall right now and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="829.2" dur="6.12">struggling in Syria</text>
  <text start="831.87" dur="5.48">so once again the United States will be</text>
  <text start="835.32" dur="5.64">sending more and more troops into Iraq</text>
  <text start="837.35" dur="5.52">into Syria into Libya into all the</text>
  <text start="840.96" dur="4.47">countries where they&amp;#39;re losing control</text>
  <text start="842.87" dur="4.75">we see the Islamic state they have taken</text>
  <text start="845.43" dur="3.96">three thousand hostages in Iraq which</text>
  <text start="847.62" dur="3.33">means that the u.s. is going to be</text>
  <text start="849.39" dur="3.3">sending more troops there we know</text>
  <text start="850.95" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re bringing in four hundred troops</text>
  <text start="852.69" dur="3.48">which are going to be deploying from</text>
  <text start="854.31" dur="4.38">Fort Campbell there&amp;#39;s already talks that</text>
  <text start="856.17" dur="5.55">more troops are going into Iraq and we</text>
  <text start="858.69" dur="5.25">have to remember how they use the troops</text>
  <text start="861.72" dur="4.17">there they call them advisors but we</text>
  <text start="863.94" dur="3.63">know they&amp;#39;re not advisors we know</text>
  <text start="865.89" dur="2.97">there&amp;#39;s a treaty with a rack that the</text>
  <text start="867.57" dur="4.59">United States can only have something</text>
  <text start="868.86" dur="7.41">like 4600 and change number of soldiers</text>
  <text start="872.16" dur="6.27">in Iraq permanently but the United</text>
  <text start="876.27" dur="6.12">States what they do to get around this</text>
  <text start="878.43" dur="8.52">treaty that they have is they call the</text>
  <text start="882.39" dur="6.3">other advisers soldiers temporary with</text>
  <text start="886.95" dur="4.2">no expiration date and there&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="888.69" dur="7.92">you know five six thousand of those</text>
  <text start="891.15" dur="9.66">there we see John Kerry well since the</text>
  <text start="896.61" dur="7.38">Aleppo offensive has failed in the</text>
  <text start="900.81" dur="7.43">beginning of August Kerry is pressing on</text>
  <text start="903.99" dur="7.98">Russia to for cooperation talks on syria</text>
  <text start="908.24" dur="5.289">now while Kari is pressing Russia for</text>
  <text start="911.97" dur="3.72">more talk saying oh yes we need</text>
  <text start="913.529" dur="4.5">ceasefire we need a peace talk we need</text>
  <text start="915.69" dur="6.78">all of this because our plans completely</text>
  <text start="918.029" dur="7.411">failed this Saturday we see that the</text>
  <text start="922.47" dur="5.91">moderate rebels al-nusrah al-qaeda they</text>
  <text start="925.44" dur="7.41">launched another offensive against</text>
  <text start="928.38" dur="6.329">Aleppo so we can see what the government</text>
  <text start="932.85" dur="3.63">the US government is talking about and</text>
  <text start="934.709" dur="4.38">how they&amp;#39;re approaching Russia is</text>
  <text start="936.48" dur="5.79">completely different in what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="939.089" dur="5.581">doing in the background and again</text>
  <text start="942.27" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re not really making that much of a</text>
  <text start="944.67" dur="6.48">headway in Aleppo they&amp;#39;re being pushed</text>
  <text start="947.52" dur="7.74">back and we can see right now every time</text>
  <text start="951.15" dur="6.33">the US loses or it fails or their agenda</text>
  <text start="955.26" dur="5.01">isn&amp;#39;t met they talk about ceasefire</text>
  <text start="957.48" dur="4.56">peace when they&amp;#39;re when they have the</text>
  <text start="960.27" dur="4.47">upper hand they don&amp;#39;t want to hear</text>
  <text start="962.04" dur="3.72">anything about ceasefire peace and this</text>
  <text start="964.74" dur="3.36">is something that working to</text>
  <text start="965.76" dur="6.59">watching we see there is a</text>
  <text start="968.1" dur="7.83">machete-wielding man out in Belgium</text>
  <text start="972.35" dur="4.99">screaming Allahu Akbar all over the</text>
  <text start="975.93" dur="3.84">place now of course the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="977.34" dur="4.29">took responsibility for this and we can</text>
  <text start="979.77" dur="5.16">we could see what&amp;#39;s going on here in</text>
  <text start="981.63" dur="5.4">Germany and Belgium and France and many</text>
  <text start="984.93" dur="4.17">other the European countries the United</text>
  <text start="987.03" dur="7.02">States government central bankers they</text>
  <text start="989.1" dur="7.2">need for these countries to be with them</text>
  <text start="994.05" dur="4.95">with what&amp;#39;s going on in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="996.3" dur="4.98">most of these countries want to get rid</text>
  <text start="999" dur="5.28">of the sanctions with Russia and by</text>
  <text start="1001.28" dur="5.64">having these terrorist attacks they try</text>
  <text start="1004.28" dur="5.25">to say hey you&amp;#39;re not going to do that</text>
  <text start="1006.92" dur="4.62">because if you do that there&amp;#39;ll be more</text>
  <text start="1009.53" dur="4.23">of these type of attacks and they try to</text>
  <text start="1011.54" dur="4.38">use them to say the situation is getting</text>
  <text start="1013.76" dur="4.56">out of hand in the Middle East you need</text>
  <text start="1015.92" dur="4.53">more laws you need more police on the</text>
  <text start="1018.32" dur="5.28">ground and we need more troops and</text>
  <text start="1020.45" dur="5.79">military assets in the middle eastern</text>
  <text start="1023.6" dur="4.62">area of Iraq Syria and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="1026.24" dur="4.11">what is going on each and every single</text>
  <text start="1028.22" dur="3.75">time now of course all those countries</text>
  <text start="1030.35" dur="4.56">that are slipping through the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1031.97" dur="5.07">fingers who are trying to maybe get</text>
  <text start="1034.91" dur="4.56">closer to Russia they put a lot of</text>
  <text start="1037.04" dur="4.44">pressure on them and try to bring them</text>
  <text start="1039.47" dur="4.29">back into the fold now something very</text>
  <text start="1041.48" dur="4.77">interesting we see the American</text>
  <text start="1043.76" dur="5.46">authorities they fear terror networks</text>
  <text start="1046.25" dur="4.67">are already in the US now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1049.22" dur="5.51">discussed this many many times before</text>
  <text start="1050.92" dur="7.18">where the US has already in place</text>
  <text start="1054.73" dur="5.95">operatives prepared and ready to go when</text>
  <text start="1058.1" dur="4.23">they get the green light and right now</text>
  <text start="1060.68" dur="4.11">we have the propaganda that&amp;#39;s coming out</text>
  <text start="1062.33" dur="4.53">saying the terror networks are already</text>
  <text start="1064.79" dur="6.21">inside the United States ready to</text>
  <text start="1066.86" dur="7.64">perform some type of terror event on the</text>
  <text start="1071" dur="5.64">American people so we hear you the</text>
  <text start="1074.5" dur="3.88">President of the United States out there</text>
  <text start="1076.64" dur="4.49">saying that yes the Islamic states on</text>
  <text start="1078.38" dur="5.88">the run but they do have the means to</text>
  <text start="1081.13" dur="4.93">stage a terror attack on the United</text>
  <text start="1084.26" dur="3.72">States and throughout Europe we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1086.06" dur="3.57">getting information from the American</text>
  <text start="1087.98" dur="3.15">authorities that they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="1089.63" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re already here in the country now</text>
  <text start="1091.13" dur="5.4">what that tells us is that we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1094.43" dur="5.37">very very close to the point where</text>
  <text start="1096.53" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re going to stage these events</text>
  <text start="1099.8" dur="4.44">and this is something that we need to</text>
  <text start="1101.69" dur="5.01">continually watch because we realize the</text>
  <text start="1104.24" dur="5.85">economy is deteriorating we have the</text>

  <text start="1115.13" dur="5.4">with Russia get closer to Russia Turkey</text>
  <text start="1117.62" dur="4.77">that coup was a complete mess and things</text>
  <text start="1120.53" dur="5.55">are really starting to accelerate right</text>
  <text start="1122.39" dur="5.01">now and we need to watch very carefully</text>
  <text start="1126.08" dur="5.13">because we&amp;#39;re getting to that point</text>
  <text start="1127.4" dur="6.99">where the US they&amp;#39;ll have no alternative</text>
  <text start="1131.21" dur="5.16">but to go ahead with some type of an</text>
