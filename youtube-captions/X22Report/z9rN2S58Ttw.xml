  <text start="346.08" dur="6.39">rates and at this point in time we</text>
  <text start="348.45" dur="6.87">realize that Trump has pushed tariffs</text>
  <text start="352.47" dur="4.62">has gone after Facebook in the tech</text>
  <text start="355.32" dur="5.01">sector which is going to affect defang</text>

  <text start="453" dur="3.84">of QE</text>
  <text start="453.63" dur="5.19">ended in late 2014 that was put out into</text>
  <text start="456.84" dur="4.2">the public but we know covertly they</text>
  <text start="458.82" dur="3.78">were still using QE and they just moved</text>
  <text start="461.04" dur="4.05">it from central bank to central bank</text>
  <text start="462.6" dur="5.85">like the Japanese Japanese central bank</text>
  <text start="465.09" dur="5.07">then it moved over to the ECB and then</text>
  <text start="468.45" dur="4.29">the Fed and they just moved it around to</text>
  <text start="470.16" dur="5.28">make it look like well QE is really not</text>
  <text start="472.74" dur="4.62">happening but it really is the Fed now</text>

  <text start="494.69" dur="5.47">2006 eventually brought about a 50</text>
  <text start="497.64" dur="4.74">percent stock market correction with an</text>
  <text start="500.16" dur="5.04">overvalued market and a potential trade</text>

  <text start="656.35" dur="5.85">to start out very very slowly so we see</text>
  <text start="659.5" dur="7.17">have both factions right now fighting</text>
  <text start="662.2" dur="6.57">for the narrative of the entire system</text>
  <text start="666.67" dur="4.38">coming down and we&amp;#39;re going to see this</text>
  <text start="668.77" dur="4.89">ramped up as we move throughout this</text>
  <text start="671.05" dur="4.38">year and it&amp;#39;s going to be out there a</text>
  <text start="673.66" dur="3.36">lot more we&amp;#39;re going to start to see</text>
  <text start="675.43" dur="3.48">that the corporate media is gonna say</text>
  <text start="677.02" dur="3.03">the economy is breaking down because of</text>
  <text start="678.91" dur="2.79">Trump and they&amp;#39;re gonna start bringing</text>
  <text start="680.05" dur="3.33">up these stories we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot</text>
  <text start="681.7" dur="3">of stories that are gonna be coming out</text>
  <text start="683.38" dur="3.39">and we&amp;#39;ve said this a long time ago and</text>
  <text start="684.7" dur="4.2">here we are today we&amp;#39;re already starting</text>
  <text start="686.77" dur="4.38">to see those type of stories where</text>
  <text start="688.9" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re already trying to gain the</text>
  <text start="691.15" dur="4.68">narrative of blaming all this on Trump</text>
  <text start="693.73" dur="3.39">now Trump is doing the opposite and he</text>
  <text start="695.83" dur="4.38">knows what they&amp;#39;ve been doing in the</text>
  <text start="697.12" dur="5.34">past they understands the manipulation</text>
  <text start="700.21" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;ve been using he knows all of this</text>
  <text start="702.46" dur="5.43">and he&amp;#39;s trying to use this as his</text>
  <text start="705.43" dur="4.8">advantage to gain the narrative and to</text>
  <text start="707.89" dur="5.34">blame it on them and all he needs to do</text>
  <text start="710.23" dur="4.35">is basically say you know something to</text>
  <text start="713.23" dur="2.79">get to the bottom of this because I do</text>
  <text start="714.58" dur="3">believe it was the central bank and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="716.02" dur="4.34">sure he has a lot of information on the</text>
  <text start="717.58" dur="4.699">central bank we should audit them</text>
  <text start="720.36" dur="3.419">and again we know that there are a lot</text>
  <text start="722.279" dur="3.511">of audit bills we know there&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="723.779" dur="4.261">bills in there to say that the dollar</text>
  <text start="725.79" dur="5.19">must be hooked to gold to bring back</text>
  <text start="728.04" dur="6.18">sound money so all of this is in place</text>
  <text start="730.98" dur="4.44">right now to move away from the central</text>
  <text start="734.22" dur="3.5">banks and I think this is where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="735.42" dur="4.59">headed and I do believe that</text>
  <text start="737.72" dur="5.109">cryptocurrency is gonna play a very big</text>
  <text start="740.01" dur="4.8">role in this this is why Russia China</text>
  <text start="742.829" dur="4.801">they&amp;#39;re looking at crypto currencies it</text>
  <text start="744.81" dur="4.98">is a truth machine it&amp;#39;s a ledger where</text>
  <text start="747.63" dur="4.59">people can see all the transactions and</text>
  <text start="749.79" dur="3.989">they they can understand who&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="752.22" dur="3.48">what this is why terrorists and and</text>
  <text start="753.779" dur="3.661">criminals they&amp;#39;re really not gonna use</text>
  <text start="755.7" dur="3.9">this because it makes no sense to use</text>
  <text start="757.44" dur="4.53">this if it&amp;#39;s a truth machine and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="759.6" dur="4.35">ledger that shows you know pretty much</text>
  <text start="761.97" dur="3.66">all transactions it makes no sense for</text>
  <text start="763.95" dur="3.54">them to use this and I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="765.63" dur="4.579">going to be a very big push to move</text>
  <text start="767.49" dur="5.37">everything over to the the blockchain</text>
  <text start="770.209" dur="5.141">system and I think this is where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="772.86" dur="4.86">headed this is why Russia this is why</text>
  <text start="775.35" dur="4.26">China Venezuela and yes there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="777.72" dur="3.57">be those countries that are going to</text>
  <text start="779.61" dur="4.53">fight against us especially the central</text>
  <text start="781.29" dur="5.37">banks and those central banks that have</text>
  <text start="784.14" dur="5.34">deep ties and roots in certain countries</text>
  <text start="786.66" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re gonna fight against it you know</text>
  <text start="789.48" dur="4.71">as hard as I possibly can because the</text>
  <text start="791.94" dur="4.589">central banks they&amp;#39;re obsolete we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="794.19" dur="5.88">need them and they know this they know</text>
  <text start="796.529" dur="4.441">if this crypto currency system the</text>
  <text start="800.07" dur="3.959">blockchain</text>
  <text start="800.97" dur="4.92">if it goes mainstream and people start</text>
  <text start="804.029" dur="4.62">to figure it out and people start to</text>
  <text start="805.89" dur="4.08">realize what this really is instead of</text>
  <text start="808.649" dur="3.781">just thinking Bitcoin it&amp;#39;s used for</text>
  <text start="809.97" dur="4.17">terrorists it&amp;#39;s used for criminals once</text>
  <text start="812.43" dur="3.38">they start to realize this and I think</text>
  <text start="814.14" dur="4.59">the awakening is coming very very soon</text>
  <text start="815.81" dur="6.01">they realize their days are numbered</text>
  <text start="818.73" dur="6.15">and they will be obsolete so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="821.82" dur="5.699">moving into very interesting times we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="824.88" dur="6.139">entering into a transitional phase just</text>
  <text start="827.519" dur="6.361">like the Soviet Union just like Germany</text>
  <text start="831.019" dur="5.171">during the Weimar Republic just like all</text>
  <text start="833.88" dur="5.819">the other countries that had to</text>
  <text start="836.19" dur="5.85">transition out of whatever system they</text>
  <text start="839.699" dur="4.771">were in into a new system and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="842.04" dur="4.68">gonna go through some you know rough</text>
  <text start="844.47" dur="4.679">patches where credit&amp;#39;s going to freeze</text>
  <text start="846.72" dur="4.59">up I mean think about it when we came on</text>
  <text start="849.149" dur="4.321">to the petrodollar system coming off the</text>
  <text start="851.31" dur="2.87">gold system I mean we went through some</text>
  <text start="853.47" dur="2.14">rough patches</text>
  <text start="854.18" dur="4.5">a lot of it was very high unemployment</text>
  <text start="855.61" dur="6.22">there was high inflation couldn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="858.68" dur="5.46">fuel couldn&amp;#39;t get certain products think</text>
  <text start="861.83" dur="4.77">about now we&amp;#39;re coming off as being the</text>
  <text start="864.14" dur="5.1">reserve currency of the world this is</text>
  <text start="866.6" dur="4.859">going to be a very rough time because</text>
  <text start="869.24" dur="4.98">once we come off of being the reserve</text>
