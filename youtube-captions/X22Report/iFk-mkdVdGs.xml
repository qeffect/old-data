  <text start="38.95" dur="5.37">August tenth 2016 and the title the</text>
  <text start="41.92" dur="6.36">episode is phase two of the August event</text>
  <text start="44.32" dur="6.419">has begun let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="48.28" dur="6.06">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="50.739" dur="8.641">now as we know under Obama we have been</text>
  <text start="54.34" dur="8.07">seeing the most number of mass shootings</text>
  <text start="59.38" dur="7.44">we have ever seen under one president</text>
  <text start="62.41" dur="6.9">and we realize this is all about pushing</text>
  <text start="66.82" dur="4.32">an agenda and of course it&amp;#39;s to get</text>
  <text start="69.31" dur="3.66">weapons away from the people because</text>
  <text start="71.14" dur="5.7">weapons in the hands of the people are</text>
  <text start="72.97" dur="5.399">people that cannot be controlled and we</text>
  <text start="76.84" dur="5.389">know the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="78.369" dur="6.481">their objective is to control the people</text>
  <text start="82.229" dur="6.311">because this is what they fear they fear</text>
  <text start="84.85" dur="5.76">a population that is armed they fear for</text>
  <text start="88.54" dur="3.51">their authority and we know they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="90.61" dur="4.08">trying to do many many different things</text>
  <text start="92.05" dur="6.36">we know the Obama administration has</text>
  <text start="94.69" dur="7.379">created executive orders which match the</text>
  <text start="98.41" dur="7.409">UN arms treaty we know that John Kerry</text>
  <text start="102.069" dur="7.681">has signed the UN arms treaty and they</text>
  <text start="105.819" dur="7.05">want the Senate to ratify it and we can</text>
  <text start="109.75" dur="5.97">see it hasn&amp;#39;t made it past that but this</text>
  <text start="112.869" dur="4.321">is what they&amp;#39;ve been pushing for and in</text>
  <text start="115.72" dur="2.55">the course of all this they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="117.19" dur="5.01">trying to come up with all different</text>
  <text start="118.27" dur="6.06">ways where they can control people with</text>
  <text start="122.2" dur="3.839">their weapons they would like to take</text>
  <text start="124.33" dur="4.53">them all the way but this might be a</text>
  <text start="126.039" dur="6.301">little bit impossible so their next</text>
  <text start="128.86" dur="6.39">order of business is to have these smart</text>
  <text start="132.34" dur="5.7">guns these smart weapons where you would</text>
  <text start="135.25" dur="5.19">wear a bracelet and it would detect the</text>
  <text start="138.04" dur="5.64">bracelet on your wrist and will allow</text>
  <text start="140.44" dur="5.7">you to pull the trigger and many of</text>
  <text start="143.68" dur="5.25">those people who are a gun enthusiasts</text>
  <text start="146.14" dur="5.88">say absolutely not I am NOT putting</text>
  <text start="148.93" dur="8.43">electronic device I don&amp;#39;t want my gun to</text>
  <text start="152.02" dur="8.34">have any type of equipment where the</text>
  <text start="157.36" dur="4.829">government can throw a switch or send a</text>
  <text start="160.36" dur="4.2">command and lock the weapon down</text>
  <text start="162.189" dur="4.261">whenever they want</text>
  <text start="164.56" dur="3.81">so what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="166.45" dur="4.23">this to the next level they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="168.37" dur="3.72">going to have the electronic weapon but</text>
  <text start="170.68" dur="3.809">instead of you wearing a bracelet</text>
  <text start="172.09" dur="5.55">because there are concerns that you know</text>
  <text start="174.489" dur="4.891">someone could rip the bracelet off carry</text>
  <text start="177.64" dur="5.91">the bracelet with them and then they</text>
  <text start="179.38" dur="8.46">have the ability to use the weapon so to</text>
  <text start="183.55" dur="9.269">bypass that they&amp;#39;ve come up with an idea</text>
  <text start="187.84" dur="11.13">of implanting an RFID chip in your wrist</text>
  <text start="192.819" dur="9.211">to activate the weapon now one man has</text>
  <text start="198.97" dur="5.22">created a prototype of this and this</text>
  <text start="202.03" dur="4.17">fits into the agenda that we&amp;#39;ve been all</text>
  <text start="204.19" dur="4.71">hearing about where they would like to</text>
  <text start="206.2" dur="4.47">implant everyone with an RFID chip which</text>
  <text start="208.9" dur="4.23">would hold your medical records your</text>
  <text start="210.67" dur="7.73">credit information and allow you to use</text>
  <text start="213.13" dur="9.169">a weapon or not and we can see that</text>
  <text start="218.4" dur="7.99">according to Obama&amp;#39;s executive orders</text>
  <text start="222.299" dur="6.491">this is where they are headed this is</text>
  <text start="226.39" dur="5.25">where they&amp;#39;re trying to push everyone</text>
  <text start="228.79" dur="5.46">because we understand that DHS is</text>
  <text start="231.64" dur="4.92">pushing the real IDs on all the states</text>
  <text start="234.25" dur="4.23">and these real IDs are going to have</text>
  <text start="236.56" dur="4.35">barcodes they&amp;#39;re going to have RFID</text>
  <text start="238.48" dur="4.92">chips retina scans and all that</text>
  <text start="240.91" dur="5.25">information about you will be correlated</text>
  <text start="243.4" dur="5.419">up to a database and these IDs will</text>
  <text start="246.16" dur="6.99">track your movements track what you do</text>
  <text start="248.819" dur="6.491">that is the step right before they say</text>
  <text start="253.15" dur="5.55">okay we&amp;#39;ve had these cards they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="255.31" dur="7.109">working out we need to implant the RFID</text>
  <text start="258.7" dur="6.12">chip right into you this way it will</text>
  <text start="262.419" dur="4.831">make it even more secure just like</text>
  <text start="264.82" dur="6.36">they&amp;#39;re going to use thumb prints on the</text>
  <text start="267.25" dur="5.55">phones and whatnot they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="271.18" dur="4.92">make it seem like it&amp;#39;s better for you</text>
  <text start="272.8" dur="7.5">but what they&amp;#39;re really doing is they</text>
  <text start="276.1" dur="8.61">were they are using this to track and</text>
  <text start="280.3" dur="9.21">control your movements to keep tabs on</text>
  <text start="284.71" dur="6.84">you and if they have the ability to get</text>
  <text start="289.51" dur="4.43">everyone to have an RFID chip in their</text>
  <text start="291.55" dur="6.55">wrists and have this electronic weapon</text>
  <text start="293.94" dur="5.99">all they have to do is send a code and</text>
  <text start="298.1" dur="4.68">they can shut down everyone&amp;#39;s weapon all</text>
  <text start="299.93" dur="5.88">at once so think about it if you have an</text>
  <text start="302.78" dur="6.12">armed population and they make it</text>
  <text start="305.81" dur="6.15">mandatory for everyone to have this type</text>
  <text start="308.9" dur="5.58">of weapon and they decide you know</text>
  <text start="311.96" dur="5.1">something we cannot take this tyrannical</text>
  <text start="314.48" dur="4.11">government anymore and people start to</text>
  <text start="317.06" dur="6.59">rise up all they do is throw a switch</text>
  <text start="318.59" dur="9.96">and it shuts everyone down all at once</text>
  <text start="323.65" dur="9.1">that&amp;#39;s the agenda behind all of this now</text>
  <text start="328.55" dur="5.46">out in South Sudan we understand things</text>
  <text start="332.75" dur="3.95">are heating up this is one of the</text>
  <text start="334.01" dur="5.52">countries where General Wesley Clark</text>
  <text start="336.7" dur="4.36">said that we&amp;#39;re going to invade replace</text>
  <text start="339.53" dur="3.27">the government put a puppet government</text>
  <text start="341.06" dur="4.26">in there didn&amp;#39;t work out that well in</text>
  <text start="342.8" dur="3.96">this country and we see Washington is</text>
  <text start="345.32" dur="4.05">continually trying to control the</text>
  <text start="346.76" dur="6.87">situation there we know that Russia and</text>
  <text start="349.37" dur="5.7">China are involved and we see that South</text>
  <text start="353.63" dur="4.41">Sudan right now has rejected</text>
  <text start="355.07" dur="5.09">Washington&amp;#39;s proposal for UN Security</text>
  <text start="358.04" dur="5.76">Council to send four thousand</text>
  <text start="360.16" dur="6.55">peacekeepers to the country and as we</text>
  <text start="363.8" dur="7.35">know under the UN agenda these</text>
  <text start="366.71" dur="6.9">peacekeepers are combat ready military</text>
  <text start="371.15" dur="5.66">soldiers that will protect civilians and</text>
  <text start="373.61" dur="6.27">once they&amp;#39;re fired upon guess what</text>
  <text start="376.81" dur="5.74">they&amp;#39;re off to war and the South</text>
  <text start="379.88" dur="4.8">Sudanese government said that the</text>
  <text start="382.55" dur="5.04">proposal would allow these peacekeepers</text>
  <text start="384.68" dur="7.01">to engage in combat and this is</text>
  <text start="387.59" dur="6.48">something we do not want and the u.s.</text>
  <text start="391.69" dur="4.78">they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="394.07" dur="5.22">to keep control of all of these</text>
  <text start="396.47" dur="4.98">countries because remember they want the</text>
  <text start="399.29" dur="4.29">natural resources and they want these</text>
  <text start="401.45" dur="4.29">countries to use the dollar on the</text>
  <text start="403.58" dur="4.32">natural resources to keep the system</text>
  <text start="405.74" dur="3.36">prompt up for a little bit longer they</text>
  <text start="407.9" dur="4.98">know they can&amp;#39;t do it forever it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="409.1" dur="7.38">impossible and we can see that time is</text>
  <text start="412.88" dur="6.57">now running out and we see the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="416.48" dur="4.17">continually provoking countries around</text>
  <text start="419.45" dur="4.95">the world and we&amp;#39;ve said this many times</text>
  <text start="420.65" dur="9.39">it&amp;#39;s China North Korea Russia and we see</text>
  <text start="424.4" dur="7.26">now that Vietnam they have moved there</text>
  <text start="430.04" dur="5.43">is really made extra</text>
  <text start="431.66" dur="7.98">mobile rocket launchers and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="435.47" dur="7.02">pointed them towards China they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="439.64" dur="5.22">striking distance in hitting China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.49" dur="7.44">runways and military installations</text>
  <text start="444.86" dur="9.93">across the trade route and we have to</text>
  <text start="449.93" dur="10.2">remember back in May of 2016 Obama</text>
  <text start="454.79" dur="10.58">decided to visit vietnam and he made</text>
  <text start="460.13" dur="9.42">deals with them he&amp;#39;s given the made and</text>
  <text start="465.37" dur="6.07">we also have to remember the US was not</text>
  <text start="469.55" dur="4.41">doing business with Vietnam because of</text>
  <text start="471.44" dur="4.95">their human rights violation now many in</text>
  <text start="473.96" dur="4.68">Congress was saying what is he doing</text>
  <text start="476.39" dur="3.57">there they haven&amp;#39;t fixed their human</text>
  <text start="478.64" dur="3.96">rights violation why are we doing</text>
  <text start="479.96" dur="5.61">business with them because they need</text>
  <text start="482.6" dur="6.96">each one of these countries Vietnam the</text>
  <text start="485.57" dur="6.72">Philippines all of them they need the</text>
  <text start="489.56" dur="6.12">military assets on all of these areas</text>
  <text start="492.29" dur="5.28">pointing towards China because when war</text>
  <text start="495.68" dur="4.29">breaks out they need everything set up</text>
  <text start="497.57" dur="4.92">and ready to go and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="499.97" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re doing so they don&amp;#39;t care anymore</text>
  <text start="502.49" dur="5.37">about human rights violations they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="505.61" dur="3.75">care if the person is a dictator it</text>
  <text start="507.86" dur="3.35">makes no difference as long as they</text>
  <text start="509.36" dur="5.4">cooperate with the United States side</text>
  <text start="511.21" dur="5.53">for the upcoming war the United States</text>
  <text start="514.76" dur="3.659">is then satisfied and i should say the</text>
  <text start="516.74" dur="3.42">united states government is satisfied</text>
  <text start="518.419" dur="6.561">the central bankers are satisfied</text>
  <text start="520.16" dur="8.22">satisfied the neocons are satisfied and</text>
  <text start="524.98" dur="5.92">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this huge</text>
  <text start="528.38" dur="6.59">buildup and it&amp;#39;s going to continue we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="530.9" dur="7.11">seen it continued for many years now and</text>
  <text start="534.97" dur="6.19">we&amp;#39;re reaching a point where China</text>
  <text start="538.01" dur="5.97">Russia they all know what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="541.16" dur="6.33">here they&amp;#39;re building up their military</text>
  <text start="543.98" dur="9.63">forces and all we need is one little</text>
  <text start="547.49" dur="9.63">slip-up and we will be off to war and we</text>
  <text start="553.61" dur="5.25">will see something like this happen very</text>
  <text start="557.12" dur="5.94">very soon because we know the United</text>
  <text start="558.86" dur="6.61">States there in the Middle East Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="563.06" dur="4.96">on the other side where Syria is</text>

  <text start="568.02" dur="10.26">Ukraine Russia is also there we also</text>
  <text start="575.37" dur="8.21">know in the South Pacific they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="578.28" dur="9.08">to provoke China and one of these times</text>
  <text start="583.58" dur="6.34">something will happen in North Korea</text>
  <text start="587.36" dur="7.78">they&amp;#39;re trying to provoke North Korea at</text>
  <text start="589.92" dur="7.86">the same time doesn&amp;#39;t matter who they</text>
  <text start="595.14" dur="6.21">get to start something all the players</text>
  <text start="597.78" dur="6.66">will be the same now we have seen phase</text>
  <text start="601.35" dur="6.36">one of the August event it&amp;#39;s in motion</text>

  <text start="614.67" dur="5.49">event remember as this economy</text>
  <text start="617.7" dur="3.72">continually deteriorates the United</text>
  <text start="620.16" dur="3.98">States government central bankers the</text>
  <text start="621.42" dur="8.54">neocons the shadow government the elites</text>
  <text start="624.14" dur="8.46">they need to get this war started and</text>
  <text start="629.96" dur="5.47">we&amp;#39;re starting to see evidence that</text>
  <text start="632.6" dur="5.83">they&amp;#39;re going to be pushing very very</text>
  <text start="635.43" dur="5.94">hard right now Russia&amp;#39;s Federal Security</text>

  <text start="673.26" dur="3.84">out there saying that Kiev is playing a</text>
  <text start="675.66" dur="4.62">deadly game they have turned to</text>
  <text start="677.1" dur="5.4">terrorism well I think there have always</text>
  <text start="680.28" dur="3.24">been using terrorism because this is</text>
  <text start="682.5" dur="4.19">what the United States government</text>

  <text start="710.26" dur="5.12">surprise to anybody because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="712.99" dur="7.62">following what has been happening in</text>
  <text start="715.38" dur="8.13">Ukraine all the training all the lethal</text>
  <text start="720.61" dur="8.34">non-lethal weapons coming into Ukraine</text>

  <text start="805.41" dur="5.95">where they can say we need to go to war</text>

  <text start="892.239" dur="2.97">they&amp;#39;ve been planning this for a very</text>
  <text start="893.289" dur="3.98">long time this just didn&amp;#39;t happen where</text>
  <text start="895.209" dur="4.38">the US said hey let&amp;#39;s go bomb them</text>

  <text start="913.899" dur="4.23">planned from the beginning and we knew</text>
  <text start="916.749" dur="2.7">they were waiting for the permission of</text>

  <text start="935.199" dur="8.1">into Libya and help out they need</text>
  <text start="937.929" dur="7.17">international help there is the call so</text>
  <text start="943.299" dur="5.94">most likely we&amp;#39;re going to see France</text>
  <text start="945.099" dur="8.97">Italy UK and the rest of the coalition</text>
  <text start="949.239" dur="8.19">forces go into Libya and take control of</text>

  <text start="995.55" dur="3.03">prepared for all of this it&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="997.11" dur="4.169">because the corporate media the</text>

  <text start="1004.279" dur="3.841">op teams but it&amp;#39;s a light footprint and</text>
  <text start="1006.05" dur="5.7">you know what&amp;#39;s going to happen later on</text>
  <text start="1008.12" dur="6.69">as the unity government makes their</text>
  <text start="1011.75" dur="5.73">international call for help we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1014.81" dur="7.35">to see more and more soldiers on the</text>
  <text start="1017.48" dur="7.56">ground in Libya and they&amp;#39;ll say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1022.16" dur="8.46">advisers the unity government asks us to</text>
  <text start="1025.04" dur="8.76">do this so what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the</text>
  <text start="1030.62" dur="5.49">August event it is continuing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1033.8" dur="5.279">getting worse and worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="1036.11" dur="5.339">and we need to watch this situation very</text>
  <text start="1039.079" dur="5.461">carefully now we know that Putin and</text>
  <text start="1041.449" dur="5.01">dejuan they have met and Russia they had</text>
  <text start="1044.54" dur="6.84">certain topics they wanted to discuss</text>
  <text start="1046.459" dur="7.941">and the priority for turkey is to stop</text>
  <text start="1051.38" dur="5.75">attempts at regime change in syria and</text>
  <text start="1054.4" dur="6.76">included in this is armenia and</text>
  <text start="1057.13" dur="6.58">tajikistan russia says this means the</text>
  <text start="1061.16" dur="6.09">expulsion of Chechen fighters from their</text>
  <text start="1063.71" dur="6.93">havens in Turkey they want Turkey to</text>
  <text start="1067.25" dur="7.29">close the border with Syria and stop</text>
  <text start="1070.64" dur="7.65">funding the Islamic state they want</text>
  <text start="1074.54" dur="8.13">Turkey to stop working with Ukraine to</text>
  <text start="1078.29" dur="7.67">try to overthrow Crimea and we can see</text>
  <text start="1082.67" dur="8.55">right now that Russia is telling Turkey</text>
  <text start="1085.96" dur="6.79">these are the conditions because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1091.22" dur="2.85">talking about trade again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1092.75" dur="4.35">talking about the Turkish stream again</text>
  <text start="1094.07" dur="5.9">and we&amp;#39;ll have to see what turkey does</text>
  <text start="1097.1" dur="6.93">at this point</text>
  <text start="1099.97" dur="6.88">we see the Syrian ground forces backed</text>
  <text start="1104.03" dur="4.47">by Russian aircraft they have prevented</text>
  <text start="1106.85" dur="3.9">additional terrorist forces from gaining</text>
  <text start="1108.5" dur="5.1">access to the outskirts of the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1110.75" dur="5.66">city of Aleppo and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1113.6" dur="5.52">there&amp;#39;s a nother huge buildup of</text>
  <text start="1116.41" dur="4.6">fighters in Aleppo and I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="1119.12" dur="4.8">the terrace where they&amp;#39;re reporting</text>
  <text start="1121.01" dur="5.61">about 7,000 new fighters coming into</text>
  <text start="1123.92" dur="4.62">this area because they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1126.62" dur="3.63">continually try to push and try to get</text>
  <text start="1128.54" dur="4.71">back Aleppo now the United States</text>
  <text start="1130.25" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;re looking for a ceasefire right</text>
  <text start="1133.25" dur="5.43">now to bring in humanitarian aid and we</text>
  <text start="1136.46" dur="4.26">know why they want the ceasefire we know</text>
  <text start="1138.68" dur="4.53">why they&amp;#39;re calling for it now it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1140.72" dur="5.34">for humanitarian aid they need time to</text>
  <text start="1143.21" dur="6.3">regroup so Russia said there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1146.06" dur="5.7">be no preconditions we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1149.51" dur="4.2">continually fight as we bring in</text>
  <text start="1151.76" dur="4.86">humanitarian aid so what we&amp;#39;ll do is</text>
  <text start="1153.71" dur="4.65">maybe each and every day we&amp;#39;ll have a</text>
  <text start="1156.62" dur="3.5">little ceasefire for about two to three</text>
  <text start="1158.36" dur="4.23">hours and then we&amp;#39;ll continue fighting</text>
  <text start="1160.12" dur="5.35">so the humanitarian aid can get through</text>
  <text start="1162.59" dur="4.77">and once it&amp;#39;s through we will continue</text>
  <text start="1165.47" dur="5.58">fighting we&amp;#39;re not going to have week</text>
  <text start="1167.36" dur="5.49">long cease fires now of course this is</text>
  <text start="1171.05" dur="3">what the United States wanted and it</text>
  <text start="1172.85" dur="4.44">looks like they&amp;#39;re not going to get</text>
  <text start="1174.05" dur="7.53">their way now we know the United States</text>
  <text start="1177.29" dur="8.28">was looking into the rebels that</text>
  <text start="1181.58" dur="5.31">beheaded the Syrian child because as we</text>
  <text start="1185.57" dur="4.83">know the United States government</text>
  <text start="1186.89" dur="6.69">central bankers they fund they support</text>
  <text start="1190.4" dur="5.64">these terrorist groups and the US State</text>
  <text start="1193.58" dur="6.12">Department came up with their answer to</text>
  <text start="1196.04" dur="5.61">all of this for security reasons we</text>
  <text start="1199.7" dur="6.72">can&amp;#39;t say whether we fund rebels that</text>
  <text start="1201.65" dur="7.8">beheaded Syrian children or child well</text>
  <text start="1206.42" dur="5.25">this is another way of saying yes we</text>
  <text start="1209.45" dur="5.49">funded these individuals but we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1211.67" dur="5.1">going to let you know so right there</text>
  <text start="1214.94" dur="5.97">just from that statement the United</text>
  <text start="1216.77" dur="6.12">States is guilty very interestingly the</text>
  <text start="1220.91" dur="5.72">United States is hiring military</text>
  <text start="1222.89" dur="6.18">contractors for operations in Syria and</text>
  <text start="1226.63" dur="5.98">they&amp;#39;re doing it publicly now they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1229.07" dur="7.29">even care we need more individual</text>
  <text start="1232.61" dur="5.819">to go into Syria they&amp;#39;ve been doing this</text>
  <text start="1236.36" dur="5.73">covertly and this is what the FBI would</text>
  <text start="1238.429" dur="6.091">say Oh a lot of people are being brought</text>
  <text start="1242.09" dur="4.14">in to go over to Syria and they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="1244.52" dur="4.43">radicalized now what&amp;#39;s really happening</text>
  <text start="1246.23" dur="5.55">is the United States puts out ads</text>
  <text start="1248.95" dur="5.38">covertly trying to find individuals paid</text>
  <text start="1251.78" dur="4.83">mercenaries to go over to Syria to fight</text>
  <text start="1254.33" dur="5.49">for the Islamic state now they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="1256.61" dur="4.83">doing it out in the open the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1259.82" dur="4.47">state doesn&amp;#39;t exist but they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="1261.44" dur="6.42">recruiting these paid mercenary have to</text>
  <text start="1264.29" dur="7.8">remember the fighters that are fighting</text>
  <text start="1267.86" dur="6.689">in Syria they&amp;#39;re not even Syrian they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1272.09" dur="5.4">paid mercenaries from all different</text>
  <text start="1274.549" dur="4.831">countries around the world they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1277.49" dur="5.819">fighting for a cause they&amp;#39;re fighting</text>
  <text start="1279.38" dur="6.15">for a paycheck period that&amp;#39;s it now as</text>
  <text start="1283.309" dur="5.821">we know we have the elections coming up</text>
  <text start="1285.53" dur="6.18">in November and we know that the powers</text>
  <text start="1289.13" dur="4.28">that be they want a certain candidate in</text>
  <text start="1291.71" dur="4.53">power and if it doesn&amp;#39;t go their way</text>
  <text start="1293.41" dur="7.47">well they might end up doing something</text>
  <text start="1296.24" dur="8.939">and we reported on a couple days ago</text>
  <text start="1300.88" dur="7">that the election system the electronic</text>
  <text start="1305.179" dur="4.641">ballot casting system is going to be</text>
  <text start="1307.88" dur="6.09">part of the critical infrastructure and</text>
  <text start="1309.82" dur="6.28">DHS will now be in control of the</text>
  <text start="1313.97" dur="4.68">election systems but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1316.1" dur="6.63">interesting about all of this if there</text>
  <text start="1318.65" dur="6.84">is a cyber attack a blip or something</text>
  <text start="1322.73" dur="5.939">they pick up or create and I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="1325.49" dur="7.86">go with the create part they can call</text>
  <text start="1328.669" dur="6.571">the entire elections off our system was</text>
  <text start="1333.35" dur="4.38">hit we don&amp;#39;t know where it&amp;#39;s coming from</text>
  <text start="1335.24" dur="5.28">we don&amp;#39;t know what happened we are going</text>
  <text start="1337.73" dur="5.31">to postpone the elections now why would</text>
  <text start="1340.52" dur="4.95">they do this if they do not see the</text>
  <text start="1343.04" dur="4.139">elections going in the way they want and</text>
  <text start="1345.47" dur="4.05">they don&amp;#39;t have the ability to</text>
  <text start="1347.179" dur="4.111">manipulate they wait the way they want</text>
  <text start="1349.52" dur="3.33">it to be a manipulated because remember</text>
  <text start="1351.29" dur="5.639">if there&amp;#39;s too much of a spread it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1352.85" dur="6.09">going to really look odd strange and</text>
  <text start="1356.929" dur="7.321">people are going to catch on saying okay</text>
  <text start="1358.94" dur="6.33">wait a minute Trump Clinton we had this</text>
  <text start="1364.25" dur="4.17">huge gap</text>
  <text start="1365.27" dur="5.31">and then all of a sudden the person came</text>
  <text start="1368.42" dur="5.58">up and won the elections it&amp;#39;d be too</text>
  <text start="1370.58" dur="7.26">obvious so when we see the elections</text>
  <text start="1374" dur="5.76">happening and say Trump is pulling ahead</text>
  <text start="1377.84" dur="3.6">and I don&amp;#39;t really care which candidate</text>
  <text start="1379.76" dur="4.11">gets into office because they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1381.44" dur="4.11">going to be able to run the country we</text>
  <text start="1383.87" dur="6.39">know the elite the shadow government</text>
  <text start="1385.55" dur="8.7">they call the shots but if a certain</text>
  <text start="1390.26" dur="5.25">candidate is taking the lead all of a</text>
  <text start="1394.25" dur="3.99">sudden you will hear an announcement</text>
  <text start="1395.51" dur="6.33">that the election system has been</text>
  <text start="1398.24" dur="4.95">compromised we need to shut it down we</text>
  <text start="1401.84" dur="4.95">need to postpone for a little while</text>
  <text start="1403.19" dur="6.06">we&amp;#39;ll need to postpone temporarily well</text>
  <text start="1406.79" dur="5.79">guess what you know when the government</text>
  <text start="1409.25" dur="6.12">says temporary it means for a very long</text>
  <text start="1412.58" dur="7.05">time so this is something that we need</text>
  <text start="1415.37" dur="5.97">to watch and we need to be aware of what</text>
  <text start="1419.63" dur="5.07">is going on because we can see this is</text>
  <text start="1421.34" dur="5.25">part of their plan listen everyone</text>
