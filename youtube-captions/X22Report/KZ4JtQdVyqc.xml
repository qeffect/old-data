  <text start="107.86" dur="5.429">exchanges completely defaulting this is</text>

  <text start="115.72" dur="3.62">dropping they&amp;#39;d rather take the penalty</text>

  <text start="122.229" dur="5.611">benefit all T on on a bottom Obamacare</text>
  <text start="125.13" dur="5.379">when we know why because they all got</text>

  <text start="148.69" dur="6.45">they tried it didn&amp;#39;t work and we can see</text>
  <text start="153.129" dur="4.67">right now these corporations who are</text>
  <text start="155.14" dur="7.679">losing money because of their bill</text>
  <text start="157.799" dur="6.52">they&amp;#39;re blackmailing the government so</text>
  <text start="162.819" dur="3.84">their bill</text>

  <text start="166.659" dur="4.98">not and now Edna is out there</text>
  <text start="169.709" dur="4.84">threatening the United States government</text>
  <text start="171.639" dur="5.55">saying listen we will pull out over</text>
  <text start="174.549" dur="6.961">Obamacare if you do not approve the</text>
  <text start="177.189" dur="7.41">merger with humana well when do</text>
  <text start="181.51" dur="5.55">corporations call the shots why would a</text>
  <text start="184.599" dur="3.54">corporation be allowed to threaten the</text>
  <text start="187.06" dur="2.34">United States government the government</text>
  <text start="188.139" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s supposed to be working for the</text>
  <text start="189.4" dur="5.399">people because the corporation&amp;#39;s tell</text>
  <text start="192.669" dur="7.32">the government what to do this is a</text>
  <text start="194.799" dur="7.77">fascist country where corporations and</text>
  <text start="199.989" dur="7.771">government are intertwined and most</text>
  <text start="202.569" dur="8.551">likely Edna will get their way and this</text>
  <text start="207.76" dur="5.309">is something that we need to watch now</text>
  <text start="211.12" dur="5.819">we understand the US government central</text>
  <text start="213.069" dur="7.861">bankers they want to control the</text>
  <text start="216.939" dur="6.63">narrative of the entire story of the</text>
  <text start="220.93" dur="5.429">United States and the world and what I</text>
  <text start="223.569" dur="5.611">mean by that is they have control of the</text>
  <text start="226.359" dur="6.87">money supply they have control of the</text>
  <text start="229.18" dur="6.779">corporate media and they want control of</text>
  <text start="233.229" dur="5.491">the internet the Internet to them is a</text>
  <text start="235.959" dur="4.5">wat is like the Wild West where people</text>
  <text start="238.72" dur="4.379">can just go on the internet like myself</text>
  <text start="240.459" dur="4.86">and many others and talk about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="243.099" dur="5.371">going on around the world you know they</text>
  <text start="245.319" dur="6.69">don&amp;#39;t want people to do this they would</text>
  <text start="248.47" dur="6">like to shut them down but of course we</text>
  <text start="252.009" dur="6.09">have some parts of the Constitution</text>
  <text start="254.47" dur="5.22">still in effect the Bill of Rights where</text>
  <text start="258.099" dur="6.69">we&amp;#39;re allowed to have freedom of the</text>
  <text start="259.69" dur="7.89">press but we have to remember that they</text>
  <text start="264.789" dur="6.12">tried all different types of bills they</text>
  <text start="267.58" dur="5.97">to push their agenda where they said</text>
  <text start="270.909" dur="3.961">okay if you want to talk about anything</text>
  <text start="273.55" dur="3.63">that&amp;#39;s going on in the world you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="274.87" dur="6.389">going to have to get a license they</text>
  <text start="277.18" dur="6.329">tried to push that through Congress but</text>
  <text start="281.259" dur="3.481">that didn&amp;#39;t go anywhere and that would</text>
  <text start="283.509" dur="4.201">mean everyone in the internet would have</text>
  <text start="284.74" dur="4.979">to pay a fee and I have to be approved</text>
  <text start="287.71" dur="6.44">by the government to be allowed to talk</text>
  <text start="289.719" dur="7.85">about things on the Internet so instead</text>
  <text start="294.15" dur="8.13">they&amp;#39;re doing the next best thing</text>
  <text start="297.569" dur="7">Obama within about two months or so is</text>
  <text start="302.28" dur="7.33">going to give away control of the</text>
  <text start="304.569" dur="8.761">Internet to the United Nations and the</text>
  <text start="309.61" dur="7.35">United Nations will then control the</text>
  <text start="313.33" dur="5.67">internet now we can see this is a move</text>
  <text start="316.96" dur="3.329">to set up a one-world government it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="319" dur="4.41">lot easier to have the United Nations</text>
  <text start="320.289" dur="5.94">which is really not part of any specific</text>
  <text start="323.41" dur="5.759">nation but it seems that the United</text>
  <text start="326.229" dur="6.601">Nations likes to make the rules for many</text>
  <text start="329.169" dur="9.571">nations and it&amp;#39;s like a government body</text>
  <text start="332.83" dur="8.61">all in itself now we can see where</text>
  <text start="338.74" dur="4.739">they&amp;#39;re moving with this because the</text>
  <text start="341.44" dur="5.009">United Nations to control the internet</text>
  <text start="343.479" dur="6.481">will most likely make everyone get a log</text>
  <text start="346.449" dur="6.81">on you&amp;#39;ll have to log on and they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="349.96" dur="7.56">able to track you once you do you might</text>
  <text start="353.259" dur="9.621">have to sign up for a license or special</text>
  <text start="357.52" dur="8.79">type of access to have some type of blog</text>
  <text start="362.88" dur="4.93">you&amp;#39;ll be monitored if they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="366.31" dur="3.69">what you&amp;#39;re saying they flip a switch</text>
  <text start="367.81" dur="3.419">the US government can say hey we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="370" dur="7.199">control this we don&amp;#39;t control the</text>
  <text start="371.229" dur="9.75">internet and we can see how this will</text>
  <text start="377.199" dur="7.97">troll the freedom of speech how they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="380.979" dur="7.771">be able to control what is coming out of</text>
  <text start="385.169" dur="6.101">the news agencies because they control</text>
  <text start="388.75" dur="4.889">the corporate media and then they will</text>
  <text start="391.27" dur="4.739">finally have control of the internet and</text>
  <text start="393.639" dur="5.491">all the alternative media all the new</text>
  <text start="396.009" dur="6.241">media the truth media that is trying to</text>
  <text start="399.13" dur="6.3">get to the heart of the problem they</text>
  <text start="402.25" dur="5.27">will also be controlled and we can see</text>
  <text start="405.43" dur="4.919">that they&amp;#39;re moving in this direction</text>
  <text start="407.52" dur="6.97">they don&amp;#39;t want people talking about</text>
  <text start="410.349" dur="9.32">things they can&amp;#39;t control and the</text>
  <text start="414.49" dur="5.179">Internet is a huge huge problem for them</text>
  <text start="419.82" dur="5.86">now out in South Sudan we understand the</text>
  <text start="423.13" dur="7.77">UN wants to bring in around 4,000 troops</text>
  <text start="425.68" dur="7.38">and it&amp;#39;s basically 4,000 troops to</text>
  <text start="430.9" dur="4.65">wage war now of course it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="433.06" dur="5.85">peacekeeping mission and we know it is</text>
  <text start="435.55" dur="5.61">not the south sudan President down there</text>
  <text start="438.91" dur="4.349">said absolutely not and it looks like</text>
  <text start="441.16" dur="6.33">this whole thing the deployment is</text>
  <text start="443.259" dur="7.171">delayed at this point the government is</text>
  <text start="447.49" dur="7.17">stalling saying that we don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="450.43" dur="7.049">here and listen if a government doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="454.66" dur="5.69">want the UN in their country the UN</text>
  <text start="457.479" dur="7.111">really doesn&amp;#39;t have the right to do this</text>
  <text start="460.35" dur="6.039">now in the South China Sea we see that</text>
  <text start="464.59" dur="5.01">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="466.389" dur="8.25">bankers Japan they are provoking China</text>
  <text start="469.6" dur="8.97">like crazy now Japan they released a</text>
  <text start="474.639" dur="7.201">video showing around two to three</text>
  <text start="478.57" dur="5.129">hundred Chinese vessels near the</text>
  <text start="481.84" dur="3.87">disputed territory of the Senkaku</text>
  <text start="483.699" dur="5.28">Islands and East China in the South</text>
  <text start="485.71" dur="4.62">China Sea and that Japan is out there</text>
  <text start="488.979" dur="5.071">saying see look at all these ships</text>
  <text start="490.33" dur="6.149">they&amp;#39;re all out here and they showed</text>
  <text start="494.05" dur="7.649">that they were fishing vessels and there</text>
  <text start="496.479" dur="8.22">were also Chinese patrol boats that were</text>
  <text start="501.699" dur="4.891">protecting the fishing vessels and I</text>
  <text start="504.699" dur="5.431">think there was about twenty eight or so</text>
  <text start="506.59" dur="4.47">Chinese patrol ships now think about</text>
  <text start="510.13" dur="3.599">what the United States government</text>
  <text start="511.06" dur="5.88">central bankers have been saying we have</text>
  <text start="513.729" dur="6.211">the right to sell our ships these are</text>
  <text start="516.94" dur="4.019">the open seas the law of the sea but we</text>
  <text start="519.94" dur="3.99">have to remember that the United States</text>
  <text start="520.959" dur="5.961">never signed this whatsoever they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="523.93" dur="6.3">just using it and if this is the case</text>
  <text start="526.92" dur="7.66">isn&amp;#39;t that what China is doing selling</text>
  <text start="530.23" dur="5.85">their ships in the open seas don&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="534.58" dur="3.9">have the right of way to do this of</text>
  <text start="536.08" dur="6">course they do plus they&amp;#39;re in the South</text>
  <text start="538.48" dur="5.52">China Sea and they&amp;#39;re protecting their</text>
  <text start="542.08" dur="5.19">ships it&amp;#39;s not like they have their</text>
  <text start="544" dur="5.67">ships in the Gulf of Mexico I can</text>
  <text start="547.27" dur="5.7">understand the United States being upset</text>
  <text start="549.67" dur="5.09">but the South China Sea shared by many</text>
  <text start="552.97" dur="4.35">of the nation&amp;#39;s Japan being one of them</text>
  <text start="554.76" dur="6.55">yes there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot of ships</text>
  <text start="557.32" dur="7.27">in this area and Japan also has patrol</text>
  <text start="561.31" dur="6.18">ships in this area but we can see</text>
  <text start="564.59" dur="6.18">the whole point of this was to show that</text>
  <text start="567.49" dur="4.78">look there in this area and there are</text>
  <text start="570.77" dur="5.58">patrol ships and of course what Japan</text>
  <text start="572.27" dur="7.08">did was they announced that hey you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="576.35" dur="5.55">getting very close to our area of the</text>
  <text start="579.35" dur="5.82">sea please back off but the Chinese</text>
  <text start="581.9" dur="6.96">ships never entered it they were in</text>
  <text start="585.17" dur="5.25">international water but what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="588.86" dur="5.03">doing here is they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="590.42" dur="6.54">everyone believe that this is a problem</text>
  <text start="593.89" dur="5.11">well the only problem is is that the</text>
  <text start="596.96" dur="5.64">United States Japan and the other</text>
  <text start="599" dur="6.39">nations they are continually using this</text>
  <text start="602.6" dur="7.31">to provoke China to do something they</text>
  <text start="605.39" dur="8.52">want an incident they&amp;#39;re hoping for one</text>
  <text start="609.91" dur="6.61">so they can push war now the United</text>
  <text start="613.91" dur="5.4">States and South Korea they are</text>
  <text start="616.52" dur="5.07">continually pushing North Korea and we</text>
  <text start="619.31" dur="4.29">know the United States brought in the</text>
  <text start="621.59" dur="5.43">terminal high altitude area defense</text>
  <text start="623.6" dur="6.21">system fed and they place it in the area</text>
  <text start="627.02" dur="5.4">of South Korea well now they want to</text>
  <text start="629.81" dur="5.31">take it a step further they have plans</text>
  <text start="632.42" dur="6.74">to set up the Thad like naval system and</text>
  <text start="635.12" dur="8.52">they&amp;#39;re going to equip their warships</text>
  <text start="639.16" dur="8.62">with this sent with this system so they</text>
  <text start="643.64" dur="7.32">can intercept missiles that North Korea</text>
  <text start="647.78" dur="5.46">fires now I can see a situation where</text>
  <text start="650.96" dur="3.89">North Korea is testing whether missiles</text>
  <text start="653.24" dur="4.5">may be shooting it into the ocean and</text>
  <text start="654.85" dur="5.14">south korea says the missile was heading</text>
  <text start="657.74" dur="4.41">for them and they had to launch the</text>
  <text start="659.99" dur="5.7">THAAD missile system from one of their</text>
  <text start="662.15" dur="7.71">warships and I can see how this can</text>
  <text start="665.69" dur="5.37">spiral out of control and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="669.86" dur="3.3">watch that situation very carefully</text>
  <text start="671.06" dur="3.18">because we can see right now united</text>
  <text start="673.16" dur="2.4">states government central bankers</text>
  <text start="674.24" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="675.56" dur="6.81">to start something in each one of these</text>
  <text start="679.88" dur="4.11">areas in the south pacific the Middle</text>

  <text start="790.67" dur="6.02">for this for quite a while and we can</text>

  <text start="796.69" dur="7.03">attack in the infrastructure of Crimea</text>
  <text start="800.98" dur="5.71">they&amp;#39;re just trying anything they</text>
  <text start="803.72" dur="5.16">possibly can do to get this offensive</text>
  <text start="806.69" dur="4.86">off the ground yes they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="808.88" dur="5.16">shelling going on but we can see right</text>
  <text start="811.55" dur="3.81">now they really want this war to go</text>
  <text start="814.04" dur="3.03">forward but they can&amp;#39;t make it look like</text>
  <text start="815.36" dur="3.24">they just came out of nowhere and</text>
  <text start="817.07" dur="3.69">started the war they needed to make it</text>
  <text start="818.6" dur="4.77">look like it&amp;#39;s a false flag they needed</text>
  <text start="820.76" dur="4.53">to make it look like it was Russia and</text>
  <text start="823.37" dur="4.35">Crimea they need to make it look like it</text>
  <text start="825.29" dur="5.52">was the southeastern people who started</text>
  <text start="827.72" dur="4.41">it and this is the problem they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="830.81" dur="3.36">get them to do something</text>
  <text start="832.13" dur="4.05">so most likely they&amp;#39;re going to try some</text>
  <text start="834.17" dur="4.32">type of false flag they attempted it in</text>
  <text start="836.18" dur="4.02">Crimea it didn&amp;#39;t work out and I would</text>
  <text start="838.49" dur="4.86">expect they&amp;#39;re going to try it once</text>
  <text start="840.2" dur="5.82">again now the United States is out there</text>
  <text start="843.35" dur="4.53">and they&amp;#39;re trying to say that the</text>
  <text start="846.02" dur="6.24">deployment of bombers from Iran is</text>
  <text start="847.88" dur="6.39">completely illegal now where are they</text>

  <text start="854.27" dur="5.58">it&amp;#39;s from the UN Security Council</text>

  <text start="859.85" dur="9.69">on the sale and transfer of arms to Iran</text>
  <text start="864.31" dur="9.1">so under the resolution Russia did not</text>
  <text start="869.54" dur="8.85">violate any of it because they did not</text>
  <text start="873.41" dur="8.67">sell transfer arms to Iran Iran gave</text>

  <text start="885.32" dur="7.62">and everything else so they did not</text>
  <text start="890.39" dur="3.93">violate anything now of course the</text>
  <text start="892.94" dur="3.69">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="894.32" dur="5.27">they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out any reason</text>
  <text start="896.63" dur="7.23">where they can stop Russia from bombing</text>
  <text start="899.59" dur="5.83">Syria and what I mean by Syria is the</text>

  <text start="924.53" dur="7.8">realized that turkey supports terrorism</text>
  <text start="928.48" dur="6.12">now we knew this all along if you see</text>
  <text start="932.33" dur="5.76">what&amp;#39;s happening here is since turkey is</text>
  <text start="934.6" dur="5.68">piven away from united states from the</text>
  <text start="938.09" dur="5.28">european countries and moving closer to</text>

  <text start="963.95" dur="5.53">want keep</text>
  <text start="965.43" dur="6.44">borders open do not close them but we</text>
  <text start="969.48" dur="7.14">can see things are changing right now</text>
  <text start="971.87" dur="8.19">Russia has said to Turkey listen you</text>
  <text start="976.62" dur="7.76">need to close the border between</text>
  <text start="980.06" dur="8.86">yourself and Syria and there has to be</text>
  <text start="984.38" dur="8.47">international control any cited</text>
  <text start="988.92" dur="7.25">resolution 2165 which was adopted by the</text>

  <text start="1001.43" dur="7.05">area he says up until now there has been</text>
  <text start="1006.709" dur="6.151">no international observers and</text>
  <text start="1008.48" dur="6">specialists at the refugee camps no one</text>
  <text start="1012.86" dur="5.7">has been monitoring what has been going</text>
  <text start="1014.48" dur="6.51">on inside of Turkey now the United</text>
  <text start="1018.56" dur="5.79">States knew this coalition forces knew</text>
  <text start="1020.99" dur="5.969">this they didn&amp;#39;t want it they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1024.35" dur="4.43">want to abide by this resolution because</text>
  <text start="1026.959" dur="4.62">that would mean they would have to have</text>
  <text start="1028.78" dur="4.899">international observers in this area and</text>
  <text start="1031.579" dur="4.201">then he would see the flow of terrorists</text>
  <text start="1033.679" dur="4.111">moving in and out and this is why they</text>
  <text start="1035.78" dur="5.85">couldn&amp;#39;t have this happen but we can see</text>
  <text start="1037.79" dur="7.35">right now turkey will have to prove to</text>
  <text start="1041.63" dur="5.579">Russia that they are ready to change</text>
  <text start="1045.14" dur="3.69">their ways and once they close the</text>
  <text start="1047.209" dur="3.751">border that is one of the biggest</text>
  <text start="1048.83" dur="4.68">indicator showing us that they are</text>
  <text start="1050.96" dur="7.14">moving closer to Russia and further and</text>
  <text start="1053.51" dur="7.29">further away from the US and NATO we see</text>
  <text start="1058.1" dur="5.76">that the united states department of</text>
  <text start="1060.8" dur="6.15">state is blaming Russia for the</text>
  <text start="1063.86" dur="5.61">airstrikes on their moderate rebels now</text>
  <text start="1066.95" dur="4.44">Sergei Lavrov is out there saying this</text>
  <text start="1069.47" dur="5.25">is ridiculous we&amp;#39;ve been asking the</text>
  <text start="1071.39" dur="8.039">United States to give us the coordinates</text>
  <text start="1074.72" dur="6.33">of the moderate rebels and who is the</text>
  <text start="1079.429" dur="4.681">moderate rebel and who is the terrorists</text>
  <text start="1081.05" dur="5.19">all these groups are intertwined so when</text>
  <text start="1084.11" dur="3.39">we do our bombings we&amp;#39;re aiming for the</text>
  <text start="1086.24" dur="3.99">terrorists and we believe they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="1087.5" dur="4.62">terrorists show us who is not a</text>
  <text start="1090.23" dur="5.82">terrorist the problem is the United</text>
  <text start="1092.12" dur="6.72">States can&amp;#39;t do this because they</text>
  <text start="1096.05" dur="8.19">control all the terrorists</text>
  <text start="1098.84" dur="9.93">al Qaeda al-nusrah the Islamic state now</text>
  <text start="1104.24" dur="7.77">Russia is asking turkey if they can use</text>
  <text start="1108.77" dur="6">the inter lick base for air campaigns</text>
  <text start="1112.01" dur="5.01">inside of Syria they&amp;#39;re saying we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1114.77" dur="4.68">need it right now but it would be nice</text>
  <text start="1117.02" dur="5.34">to launch our planes out of that area</text>
  <text start="1119.45" dur="4.74">just like the coalition forces and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1122.36" dur="3.93">going to have to watch that very very</text>
  <text start="1124.19" dur="4.25">carefully now we&amp;#39;re getting a report</text>
  <text start="1126.29" dur="7.77">that when the United States government</text>
  <text start="1128.44" dur="9.7">was battling in men beach they gave safe</text>
  <text start="1134.06" dur="10.74">passage to the Islamic state they</text>
  <text start="1138.14" dur="10.05">allowed them to leave yeah meanwhile</text>
  <text start="1144.8" dur="7.74">Russia is destroying the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1148.19" dur="6.66">the United States drops leaflets warns</text>
  <text start="1152.54" dur="5.31">the Islamic state ahead of time allows</text>
  <text start="1154.85" dur="8.55">them to leave because they want their</text>
  <text start="1157.85" dur="7.92">proxy armies intact we can see the</text>
  <text start="1163.4" dur="5.73">Islamic state they have used chemical</text>
  <text start="1165.77" dur="7.37">weapons in Aleppo 20 people were hit</text>
  <text start="1169.13" dur="8.04">with mustard gas and this just proves</text>
  <text start="1173.14" dur="6.43">once again that it is the United States</text>
  <text start="1177.17" dur="5.34">proxy army that have been using the</text>
  <text start="1179.57" dur="5.43">chemical weapons of course they like to</text>
  <text start="1182.51" dur="6.9">blame it on Assad but we know that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1185" dur="6.59">fake phony and false now I want to talk</text>
  <text start="1189.41" dur="5.49">about the elections that we know the</text>
  <text start="1191.59" dur="6.82">Department of Homeland Security they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1194.9" dur="6.15">going to control the elections they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1198.41" dur="6.5">in charge of it but something very</text>
  <text start="1201.05" dur="8.67">interesting happened where Jay Johnson</text>
  <text start="1204.91" dur="7.93">he went to state officials and he is</text>
  <text start="1209.72" dur="8.63">offering all the states around the</text>
  <text start="1212.84" dur="9.56">country his help in protecting the</text>
  <text start="1218.35" dur="7.3">elections from cyberattacks or</text>
  <text start="1222.4" dur="6.09">vulnerabilities he says the Department</text>
  <text start="1225.65" dur="6.66">of Homeland Security will scan the</text>
  <text start="1228.49" dur="7.63">voting systems to make sure</text>
  <text start="1232.31" dur="6.2">they&amp;#39;re clean well this to me sounds</text>
  <text start="1236.12" dur="4.59">like a setup this to me sounds like</text>
  <text start="1238.51" dur="4.87">there will be scanning other things</text>
  <text start="1240.71" dur="7.19">they&amp;#39;ll be in there manipulating if</text>
  <text start="1243.38" dur="6.6">we&amp;#39;re really that concerned about voting</text>
  <text start="1247.9" dur="6.84">get rid of the electronic voting</text>
  <text start="1249.98" dur="9.83">machines do it on paper have the counts</text>
  <text start="1254.74" dur="8.59">done in front of the people in each area</text>
  <text start="1259.81" dur="6.82">then take those counts on paper and pass</text>
  <text start="1263.33" dur="4.98">them up this way we have a record but</text>
  <text start="1266.63" dur="5.85">they don&amp;#39;t want to do that because we</text>
  <text start="1268.31" dur="7.56">know the elections are fixed very</text>
  <text start="1272.48" dur="8.01">interestingly The Huffington Post ran an</text>
  <text start="1275.87" dur="9.48">article on August ninth entitled does he</text>
  <text start="1280.49" dur="6.72">that&amp;#39;s Obama deserve a third term that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1285.35" dur="6.63">very interesting because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1287.21" dur="8.88">talking about how the president has the</text>
  <text start="1291.98" dur="7.62">ability to postpone the elections but</text>
  <text start="1296.09" dur="8.43">what about if something happens in one</text>
  <text start="1299.6" dur="7.38">state or two can the governor&amp;#39;s declare</text>
  <text start="1304.52" dur="5.37">a state of emergency and postpone the</text>
  <text start="1306.98" dur="7.05">election in that state and does that</text>
  <text start="1309.89" dur="11.61">mean that the rest of the other states</text>
  <text start="1314.03" dur="11.4">must stop they can&amp;#39;t continue on and it</text>
  <text start="1321.5" dur="8.55">does seem that this is feasible under</text>
  <text start="1325.43" dur="8.67">some extraordinary circumstance Obama</text>
  <text start="1330.05" dur="6.36">could direct the state governors to say</text>
  <text start="1334.1" dur="5.16">hey postpone the elections you have a</text>
  <text start="1336.41" dur="4.71">state of emergency and we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1339.26" dur="6.39">what&amp;#39;s happening at this point so we</text>
  <text start="1341.12" dur="6.96">need to pause everything or as we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1345.65" dur="5.28">said in the past Obama has the power to</text>
  <text start="1348.08" dur="4.98">declare martial law this is reinforced</text>
  <text start="1350.93" dur="4.4">by the NDA that declares the US is in</text>
  <text start="1353.06" dur="6.84">perpetual state of war against terror</text>
  <text start="1355.33" dur="8.35">now a false flag would give Obama</text>
  <text start="1359.9" dur="5.489">stimulus where he can suspend the</text>
  <text start="1363.68" dur="4.109">elections and</text>
  <text start="1365.389" dur="6.39">constitutional rights the Posse</text>
  <text start="1367.789" dur="6.33">Comitatus Act 18 USC 1385 was</text>
  <text start="1371.779" dur="5.041">effectively nullified by the Warner</text>
  <text start="1374.119" dur="4.201">Defense Act of 2006 and then it was</text>

  <text start="1378.32" dur="2.359">NDAA</text>
  <text start="1383.649" dur="7.99">and if we break this down and we look at</text>

  <text start="1391.639" dur="8.13">codes 3 3 1 3 3 2 333 we get the</text>
