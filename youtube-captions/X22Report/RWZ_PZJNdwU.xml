  <text start="77.89" dur="3.269">out in Cyprus the people have been under</text>
  <text start="79.72" dur="4.38">capital controls for a very long time</text>
  <text start="81.159" dur="6.541">they weren&amp;#39;t allowed to take out money</text>
  <text start="84.1" dur="5.58">transfer money the banking system took</text>
  <text start="87.7" dur="5.82">about forty seven percent of their money</text>
  <text start="89.68" dur="5.31">this was all done with a ballon and of</text>
  <text start="93.52" dur="2.82">course the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="94.99" dur="2.76">government is out there saying that this</text>
  <text start="96.34" dur="4.11">is going to be good for the people but</text>
  <text start="97.75" dur="3.87">what we are seeing it was not good for</text>
  <text start="100.45" dur="3.21">the people a lot of people lost their</text>
  <text start="101.62" dur="3.51">businesses a lot of people had a very</text>
  <text start="103.66" dur="4.02">tough time surviving they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="105.13" dur="3.93">having a tough time surviving and when</text>
  <text start="107.68" dur="5.1">we look at the unemployment rate in</text>
  <text start="109.06" dur="5.55">Cyprus going back to 2013 we see the</text>
  <text start="112.78" dur="5.22">unemployment was at fifteen point nine</text>
  <text start="114.61" dur="6.03">percent and now the report has come out</text>
  <text start="118" dur="5.58">for 2014 and we see the unemployment</text>
  <text start="120.64" dur="5.51">rate has gone up to sixteen point one</text>
  <text start="123.58" dur="5.099">percent and we&amp;#39;re seeing this a lot in</text>
  <text start="126.15" dur="4.869">various country throughout the eurozone</text>
  <text start="128.679" dur="4.351">where unemployment continually goes up</text>
  <text start="131.019" dur="4.921">and the country receives more and more</text>
  <text start="133.03" dur="5.069">debt with Cyprus they&amp;#39;ve been bailed in</text>
  <text start="135.94" dur="3.93">and again it did not help the economy</text>
  <text start="138.099" dur="4.981">whatsoever because as we know that</text>
  <text start="139.87" dur="6.39">wasn&amp;#39;t the point of it the point of it</text>
  <text start="143.08" dur="5.189">was to help the banking system this is</text>
  <text start="146.26" dur="4.53">what the money printing is all about it</text>
  <text start="148.269" dur="6.681">has nothing to do with helping the</text>
  <text start="150.79" dur="8.13">people whatsoever now we understand that</text>
  <text start="154.95" dur="5.59">Greece at this point in time cannot make</text>
  <text start="158.92" dur="4.49">the next payment maybe they&amp;#39;ll figure</text>
  <text start="160.54" dur="5.36">out a way to create</text>
  <text start="163.41" dur="4.08">money out of thin air like the central</text>
  <text start="165.9" dur="4.05">bankers but at this point we could see</text>
  <text start="167.49" dur="5.79">that they&amp;#39;re broke they dipped into the</text>
  <text start="169.95" dur="5.31">emergency SDR from the IMF and right now</text>
  <text start="173.28" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re considering missing a payment</text>
  <text start="175.26" dur="3.9">but they&amp;#39;ll have to make all those</text>
  <text start="176.37" dur="5.58">payments at the end of the month we see</text>
  <text start="179.16" dur="5.37">more warnings coming out from the United</text>
  <text start="181.95" dur="5.64">States Treasury Jack Lew he warned on</text>
  <text start="184.53" dur="5.76">Friday of a possible negative effect for</text>
  <text start="187.59" dur="4.71">the world economy if Greece and its</text>
  <text start="190.29" dur="5.88">creditors missed their deadline to avert</text>
  <text start="192.3" dur="6.93">a debt default US Treasury secretary</text>
  <text start="196.17" dur="5.34">Jack Lew repeated warnings that European</text>
  <text start="199.23" dur="6.33">creditors and the IMS should not</text>
  <text start="201.51" dur="6.39">underestimate the risk of an exit that</text>
  <text start="205.56" dur="3.93">may generate instability in global</text>
  <text start="207.9" dur="4.31">economy they&amp;#39;re very worried about this</text>
  <text start="209.49" dur="6.54">and it looks like at this point in time</text>
  <text start="212.21" dur="5.17">Greece might exit I mean I think the</text>
  <text start="216.03" dur="2.91">percentage is getting higher and higher</text>
  <text start="217.38" dur="3.54">less percentage with a seventy percent</text>
  <text start="218.94" dur="5.67">but from what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="220.92" dur="6.12">with Russia extending its hand offering</text>
  <text start="224.61" dur="5.52">about five billion euros in advance for</text>
  <text start="227.04" dur="6.75">the Turkish stream pipeline we see right</text>
  <text start="230.13" dur="6.15">now Greece is preparing and will most</text>
  <text start="233.79" dur="6.21">likely submit a request to participate</text>
  <text start="236.28" dur="7.679">in the new Development Bank the bricks</text>
  <text start="240" dur="7.02">and it looks like it might secure</text>
  <text start="243.959" dur="5.041">Russia&amp;#39;s support on the entire issue and</text>
  <text start="247.02" dur="4.89">this is coming from the Russian Deputy</text>
  <text start="249" dur="4.2">Finance Minister and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="251.91" dur="4.23">see that they&amp;#39;re filling out the</text>
  <text start="253.2" dur="5.039">paperwork they&amp;#39;re getting ready to make</text>
  <text start="256.14" dur="3.569">this move and I think this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="258.239" dur="2.821">seeing all these warnings coming out</text>
  <text start="259.709" dur="3.151">from the US because I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.06" dur="5.22">going to be an exit and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="262.86" dur="5.04">have to see what occurs when this</text>
  <text start="266.28" dur="2.639">happens now of course the bankers are</text>
  <text start="267.9" dur="3.18">getting repaired they&amp;#39;ve been preparing</text>
  <text start="268.919" dur="4.5">for this and of course they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="271.08" dur="5.97">that this is not a default this has</text>
  <text start="273.419" dur="5.971">nothing to do with the banking system so</text>
  <text start="277.05" dur="4.05">will not pay out anyone for derivatives</text>
  <text start="279.39" dur="3.96">or credit default swaps running like</text>
  <text start="281.1" dur="4.62">that and we&amp;#39;re going to have to see how</text>
  <text start="283.35" dur="4.38">this really plays out because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="285.72" dur="4.14">coming into territory that we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="287.73" dur="3.93">seen before where the country is going</text>
  <text start="289.86" dur="3.15">to default other countries are going to</text>
  <text start="291.66" dur="3.72">look at this and say you know something</text>
  <text start="293.01" dur="3.73">they went to the brick system they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="295.38" dur="4.12">spurring economic</text>
  <text start="296.74" dur="4.739">a growth in this country and we might</text>
  <text start="299.5" dur="4.41">see country after country so you know</text>
  <text start="301.479" dur="6.211">something we are going to do the same</text>
  <text start="303.91" dur="9.72">exact thing we see here in the United</text>
  <text start="307.69" dur="7.56">States the economy is looking down it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="313.63" dur="2.7">not it&amp;#39;s not improving I mean many</text>
  <text start="315.25" dur="2.91">people are trying to make the case that</text>
  <text start="316.33" dur="4.26">yes it is improving and they did this</text>
  <text start="318.16" dur="4.92">prior to 2008 where they told everyone</text>
  <text start="320.59" dur="6">that things are improving housing is</text>
  <text start="323.08" dur="7.05">fine retails fine there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong</text>
