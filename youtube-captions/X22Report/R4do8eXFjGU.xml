  <text start="91.82" dur="5.55">central bank they&amp;#39;re doing everything</text>
  <text start="93.32" dur="7.02">they possibly can to stop Trump Boris</text>
  <text start="97.37" dur="5.22">Johnson and many other leaders we know</text>
  <text start="100.34" dur="3.93">that the Patriots are making a push to</text>
  <text start="102.59" dur="5.7">get rid of the central bank to separate</text>
  <text start="104.27" dur="6.42">their countries from non elected leaders</text>
  <text start="108.29" dur="5.07">that are trying to control each and</text>
  <text start="110.69" dur="7.38">every one of these countries now we know</text>
  <text start="113.36" dur="8.04">how in the UK those individuals in</text>
  <text start="118.07" dur="7.25">government they pushed a law to try to</text>
  <text start="121.4" dur="6.77">stop Boris Johnson and Boris Johnson</text>
  <text start="125.32" dur="5.83">might have a move that nobody saw coming</text>
  <text start="128.17" dur="6.61">well it seems that Trump and the</text>
  <text start="131.15" dur="5.339">Patriots knew and this would explain why</text>
  <text start="134.78" dur="5.459">Trump was saying that don&amp;#39;t worry about</text>
  <text start="136.489" dur="7.11">Boris Johnson he&amp;#39;s going to be ok he</text>
  <text start="140.239" dur="6.181">knows how to win and now it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="143.599" dur="5.731">becoming very very clear why Trump has</text>
  <text start="146.42" dur="5.489">said that now we know that Boris Johnson</text>
  <text start="149.33" dur="4.829">he&amp;#39;s going to suspend Parliament but</text>
  <text start="151.909" dur="4.201">before he does this he&amp;#39;s going to try to</text>
  <text start="154.159" dur="6.181">convince lawmakers to grant him a snap</text>
  <text start="156.11" dur="7.29">election for the second time but does he</text>
  <text start="160.34" dur="5.009">have a better plan</text>
  <text start="163.4" dur="4.589">and it seems that he does he has the</text>
  <text start="165.349" dur="4.56">simplest plan ever to a go around the</text>
  <text start="167.989" dur="4.11">legislation that was passed and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="169.909" dur="3.69">believe and I think Trump and the</text>
  <text start="172.099" dur="3.72">Patriots knew that the central bank deep</text>
  <text start="173.599" dur="7.161">state they didn&amp;#39;t see this coming at all</text>
  <text start="175.819" dur="7.771">so right now as we know the</text>
  <text start="180.76" dur="5.039">establishment those individuals that are</text>
  <text start="183.59" dur="4.44">going along with the EU the central bank</text>
  <text start="185.799" dur="5.651">they put this legislation together</text>
  <text start="188.03" dur="6.079">saying listen you need to ask the EU and</text>
  <text start="191.45" dur="5.939">you need to give permission to the EU</text>
  <text start="194.109" dur="7.78">but think about what Johnson really</text>
  <text start="197.389" dur="6.99">needs to do and it could be as simple as</text>
  <text start="201.889" dur="5.49">this and it seems that this might be</text>
  <text start="204.379" dur="6.2">what Trump was talking about all Boris</text>
  <text start="207.379" dur="5.881">Johnson needs to do he needs to attach a</text>
  <text start="210.579" dur="5.77">letter to the brexit delay legislation</text>
  <text start="213.26" dur="6.39">saying that the UK government officially</text>
  <text start="216.349" dur="8.61">does not request any extension beyond</text>
  <text start="219.65" dur="7.709">October 31st then ignore it now think</text>
  <text start="224.959" dur="6.18">about what Trump said prior to all of</text>
  <text start="227.359" dur="6.63">this it seems that it all comes into</text>
  <text start="231.139" dur="6.421">context Trump said well Boris is a</text>
  <text start="233.989" dur="6.09">friend of mine and he&amp;#39;s is going at it</text>
  <text start="237.56" dur="5.609">there&amp;#39;s no question about it he&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="240.079" dur="5.541">there I watched him this morning he&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="243.169" dur="5.07">there fighting and he knows how to win</text>
  <text start="245.62" dur="8.53">Boris knows how to win don&amp;#39;t worry about</text>
  <text start="248.239" dur="9.12">him he&amp;#39;s going to be okay now was Boris</text>
  <text start="254.15" dur="7.32">tipped off by Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="257.359" dur="7.8">maybe maybe not but it seems that Boris</text>
  <text start="261.47" dur="9.08">might have an easy out and it&amp;#39;s a simple</text>
  <text start="265.159" dur="8.341">plan where all he has to do is say hey</text>
  <text start="270.55" dur="5.32">guess what we&amp;#39;re not going to request</text>
  <text start="273.5" dur="6.99">any extension beyond October 31st and</text>
  <text start="275.87" dur="7.44">that&amp;#39;s that now here in the US Trump and</text>
  <text start="280.49" dur="4.919">the Patriots they are preparing for the</text>
  <text start="283.31" dur="3.69">transition one way to do this is to</text>
  <text start="285.409" dur="4.141">limit the number of people that are</text>
  <text start="287" dur="5.159">depending on the government because we</text>
  <text start="289.55" dur="4.95">cannot have vast amounts of people</text>
  <text start="292.159" dur="4.531">depending on the government when we go</text>
  <text start="294.5" dur="5.13">into this new economic system remember</text>
  <text start="296.69" dur="4.35">the globalist the central bank they want</text>
  <text start="299.63" dur="3.41">that people dependent on the government</text>
  <text start="301.04" dur="4.41">this way it&amp;#39;s easier to control them if</text>
  <text start="303.04" dur="4.26">you&amp;#39;re not depending on the government</text>
  <text start="305.45" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s a little bit more difficult and</text>
  <text start="307.3" dur="5.44">again it&amp;#39;s a big drag on government</text>
  <text start="311.18" dur="3.57">which means the government has to</text>
  <text start="312.74" dur="4.92">continually borrow over and over and</text>
  <text start="314.75" dur="5.82">over and since Trump has come into</text>
  <text start="317.66" dur="4.74">office at least 6.2 million Americans</text>
  <text start="320.57" dur="4.86">have dropped off food stamps and this</text>
  <text start="322.4" dur="6.24">figure was calculated from January 2017</text>
  <text start="325.43" dur="6.87">to the present day how much does this</text>
  <text start="328.64" dur="5.7">save the people well the average monthly</text>
  <text start="332.3" dur="3.09">benefits net food stamp recipients is</text>
  <text start="334.34" dur="4.95">about a hundred and twenty one dollars</text>
  <text start="335.39" dur="7.08">per person with 6.2 million off of food</text>
  <text start="339.29" dur="7.5">stamps Trump&amp;#39;s saved the country nine</text>
  <text start="342.47" dur="8.31">billion dollars annually think about</text>
  <text start="346.79" dur="5.55">this for a second and we know why all of</text>
  <text start="350.78" dur="3.48">this needs to be done because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="352.34" dur="4.14">gonna be transitioning out of this</text>
  <text start="354.26" dur="5.58">central bank system and Q has told us</text>
  <text start="356.48" dur="8.52">that gold is going to bring down the Fed</text>
  <text start="359.84" dur="8.4">let&amp;#39;s go back to post 3393 and q back</text>
  <text start="365" dur="7.41">then gives us post 2619 where anon asks</text>
  <text start="368.24" dur="9.62">a question do we have the gold and q</text>
  <text start="372.41" dur="10.29">says yes gold shall destroy the Fed and</text>
  <text start="377.86" dur="6.82">then under this q gave us a link to</text>
  <text start="382.7" dur="5.37">Trump&amp;#39;s new Fed pick which is Judy</text>
  <text start="384.68" dur="6.9">Shelton who likes the gold standard</text>
  <text start="388.07" dur="8.31">who likes sound money who&amp;#39;s on the same</text>
  <text start="391.58" dur="6.18">page as Trump now remember all this</text>
  <text start="396.38" dur="5.69">because this is where it gets really</text>
  <text start="397.76" dur="7.32">interesting marketwatch put out an</text>
  <text start="402.07" dur="5.86">article and here&amp;#39;s the title to the</text>
  <text start="405.08" dur="5.19">article the US owns the world&amp;#39;s most</text>
  <text start="407.93" dur="4.65">gold with a reserve worth three hundred</text>
  <text start="410.27" dur="4.11">and seventy three billion here&amp;#39;s who</text>
  <text start="412.58" dur="5.01">comes in second and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="414.38" dur="5.82">interesting about this it shows a map of</text>
  <text start="417.59" dur="5.54">all different countries of who has the</text>
  <text start="420.2" dur="5.82">most gold and who has the least gold and</text>
  <text start="423.13" dur="6.4">all of this is coming out of how much</text>
  <text start="426.02" dur="4.32">dotnet and it shows that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="429.53" dur="4.53">reserve of</text>
  <text start="430.34" dur="5.04">old equals 8130 three tons worth more</text>
  <text start="434.06" dur="2.04">than three hundred and seventy-three</text>
  <text start="435.38" dur="2.759">billion</text>
  <text start="436.1" dur="3.36">Germany comes in second with three</text>

  <text start="439.46" dur="4.679">tons worth more than one hundred and</text>
  <text start="441.83" dur="7.08">fifty four billion and then they go down</text>
  <text start="444.139" dur="6.78">the list to Russia China France and all</text>
  <text start="448.91" dur="5.64">the way down now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="450.919" dur="6.291">about this it says that countries have</text>
  <text start="454.55" dur="5.81">been ramping up on gold because</text>
  <text start="457.21" dur="5.8">countries were worried about the dollar</text>
  <text start="460.36" dur="6.19">they&amp;#39;re worried about relying on the</text>
  <text start="463.01" dur="6.09">dollar as a reserve currency think about</text>
  <text start="466.55" dur="5.28">this for a second why would they be</text>
  <text start="469.1" dur="6.24">worried about the dollar as a reserve</text>
  <text start="471.83" dur="6.63">currency because the plan of the central</text>
  <text start="475.34" dur="5.73">bankers of the globalists it was to</text>
  <text start="478.46" dur="5.19">shift everything away from the United</text>
  <text start="481.07" dur="4.77">States and countries those central banks</text>
  <text start="483.65" dur="3.84">in those countries they knew that this</text>
  <text start="485.84" dur="3.81">was going to happen this is why they</text>
  <text start="487.49" dur="6.41">were ramping up on gold to protect</text>
  <text start="489.65" dur="7.769">themselves it helps with a dying</text>
  <text start="493.9" dur="7.6">currency it&amp;#39;s an insurance policy now</text>
  <text start="497.419" dur="5.551">think about this if the US has eight</text>
  <text start="501.5" dur="2.7">thousand one hundred and thirty three</text>
  <text start="502.97" dur="2.73">tons and I know there&amp;#39;s many people out</text>
  <text start="504.2" dur="3.51">there say well the US doesn&amp;#39;t have it</text>
  <text start="505.7" dur="3.93">look at Fort Knox but we are getting</text>
  <text start="507.71" dur="5.069">word that Trump and the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="509.63" dur="5.31">have located the gold and they have the</text>
  <text start="512.779" dur="6.661">gold now it might not be in Fort Knox</text>
  <text start="514.94" dur="7.019">but they have the gold right now if gold</text>
  <text start="519.44" dur="4.14">right now is at fifteen hundred dollars</text>
  <text start="521.959" dur="3.451">an ounce and there&amp;#39;s eight thousand one</text>
  <text start="523.58" dur="7.129">hundred and thirty three tons what</text>
  <text start="525.41" dur="10.82">happens when gold goes up to 5,000 6,000</text>
  <text start="530.709" dur="9.101">7,000 and the dollar declines in value</text>
  <text start="536.23" dur="7">the world with all these countries and</text>
  <text start="539.81" dur="7.29">people holding gold this destroys the</text>
  <text start="543.23" dur="8.79">Fed gold sound money is worth something</text>
  <text start="547.1" dur="7.35">the Fiat paper is worth nothing right</text>
  <text start="552.02" dur="6.45">there and then the central bank is</text>
  <text start="554.45" dur="5.7">completely exposed now of course did</text>
  <text start="558.47" dur="3.54">they want this this way and I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="560.15" dur="3.72">about the deep sate the central bank did</text>
  <text start="562.01" dur="5.19">they want this all</text>
  <text start="563.87" dur="5.25">exposed like this no they didn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="567.2" dur="2.639">only reason that this is exposed like</text>
  <text start="569.12" dur="3.24">this right now</text>
  <text start="569.839" dur="6.301">where when the system collapses and the</text>
  <text start="572.36" dur="5.61">Fiat system collapses and people are</text>
  <text start="576.14" dur="4.08">going to see the gold price move up and</text>
  <text start="577.97" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re gonna say wow look at gold is</text>
  <text start="580.22" dur="5.46">holding its value and the fiat currency</text>
  <text start="583.43" dur="5.22">is not the only reason we&amp;#39;re seeing this</text>
  <text start="585.68" dur="6.81">right now is because they never expected</text>
  <text start="588.65" dur="5.82">Trump to win they never expected any of</text>
  <text start="592.49" dur="4.349">this they thought it was going to turn</text>
  <text start="594.47" dur="4.23">out completely different and what I mean</text>
  <text start="596.839" dur="4.111">by that is they thought they were going</text>
  <text start="598.7" dur="5.88">to have this an event which covered all</text>
  <text start="600.95" dur="6.45">of this up I mean go back to 71 1970</text>
  <text start="604.58" dur="4.77">1971 where we had two economic systems</text>
  <text start="607.4" dur="4.05">running parallel which was the gold</text>
  <text start="609.35" dur="3.63">standard which we were on I know I know</text>
  <text start="611.45" dur="3.69">not fully on the goals in it but</text>
  <text start="612.98" dur="5.28">partially we were on the gold standard</text>
  <text start="615.14" dur="5.28">and they were creating the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="618.26" dur="4.05">system member Henry Kissinger was in the</text>
  <text start="620.42" dur="4.53">Middle East creating the deals with all</text>
  <text start="622.31" dur="5.279">the different countries now think about</text>
  <text start="624.95" dur="5.22">this for a second back then they used</text>
  <text start="627.589" dur="4.081">the story of speculators in the gold</text>
  <text start="630.17" dur="2.46">market and this is why we had to come</text>
  <text start="631.67" dur="3.03">off the gold standard</text>
  <text start="632.63" dur="4.02">if Trump didn&amp;#39;t win and we had someone</text>
  <text start="634.7" dur="4.62">else in the White House right now they</text>
  <text start="636.65" dur="5.79">would have used an event to explain why</text>
  <text start="639.32" dur="5.639">the system is crashing most likely a war</text>
  <text start="642.44" dur="4.29">and they would say this is why the</text>
  <text start="644.959" dur="4.801">credit system is freezing up this is</text>
  <text start="646.73" dur="7.47">widely shelves are bare this is why</text>
  <text start="649.76" dur="6.72">everyone has to sacrifice and behind the</text>
  <text start="654.2" dur="4.53">scenes you know during the war after the</text>
  <text start="656.48" dur="3.66">war they would have restarted the entire</text>
  <text start="658.73" dur="3.72">system no one would have been the wiser</text>
  <text start="660.14" dur="5.79">of who has gold who doesn&amp;#39;t have gold</text>
  <text start="662.45" dur="5.34">that the Fiat system system collapsed</text>
  <text start="665.93" dur="3.99">they would nobody would even realize</text>
  <text start="667.79" dur="6.27">this they would think it was because of</text>
  <text start="669.92" dur="6.03">the war but because the other candidate</text>
  <text start="674.06" dur="6.44">didn&amp;#39;t win and that was Clinton and</text>
  <text start="675.95" dur="7.65">Trump did win they don&amp;#39;t have this now</text>
  <text start="680.5" dur="5.08">everything is out in the open the story</text>
  <text start="683.6" dur="4.62">has completely changed not in the favor</text>
  <text start="685.58" dur="5.9">of the central bank it&amp;#39;s in the favor of</text>
  <text start="688.22" dur="7.26">the Patriots where now they can show</text>
  <text start="691.48" dur="5.95">everyone around the world the central</text>
  <text start="695.48" dur="4.71">bank fianc system</text>
  <text start="697.43" dur="5.4">does not work after a certain period of</text>
