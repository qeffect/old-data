  <text start="142.37" dur="5.83">destruction of the central bank economy</text>
  <text start="145.909" dur="5.521">just think about what has been happening</text>
  <text start="148.2" dur="6.09">here Trump has been controlling the Fed</text>
  <text start="151.43" dur="6.82">telling the Fed listen we need to lower</text>
  <text start="154.29" dur="7.32">interest rates we need stimulus he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="158.25" dur="5.91">using tariffs to put pressure on China</text>
  <text start="161.61" dur="5.48">and this pressure</text>
  <text start="164.16" dur="6.39">is forcing companies to make a decision</text>
  <text start="167.09" dur="6.52">should we stay in China and pay the</text>
  <text start="170.55" dur="5.85">fines is this going to continue or</text>
  <text start="173.61" dur="5.21">should we move out of China into another</text>
  <text start="176.4" dur="6.56">country or back to the United States</text>
  <text start="178.82" dur="7.66">Trump right now he&amp;#39;s looking at</text>
  <text start="182.96" dur="6.34">increasing the tariffs and he&amp;#39;s putting</text>
  <text start="186.48" dur="6.48">more pressure on these companies this is</text>
  <text start="189.3" dur="7.89">all being done on purpose what we also</text>
  <text start="192.96" dur="7.11">see happening is how in the UK Boris</text>
  <text start="197.19" dur="8.13">Johnson and Trump they have already made</text>
  <text start="200.07" dur="10.29">a tentative free-trade agreement so when</text>
  <text start="205.32" dur="6.81">the UK leaves the EU the UK doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="210.36" dur="5.07">to worry the people don&amp;#39;t have to worry</text>
  <text start="212.13" dur="4.95">everything that the EU was putting out</text>
  <text start="215.43" dur="4.35">there all that fear-mongering that</text>
  <text start="217.08" dur="7.47">completely disappears but what else</text>
  <text start="219.78" dur="6.39">happens all the other EU nations they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="224.55" dur="4.05">thinking to themselves we&amp;#39;ll wait a</text>
  <text start="226.17" dur="5.25">minute they have this incredible free</text>
  <text start="228.6" dur="6.27">trade deal with the US they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="231.42" dur="5.24">really well and the EU is not</text>
  <text start="234.87" dur="4.47">controlling them</text>
  <text start="236.66" dur="3.87">Italy&amp;#39;s gonna look at this Hungary&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="239.34" dur="3.9">gonna look at this</text>
  <text start="240.53" dur="5.86">when micron is out lepen is gonna look</text>
  <text start="243.24" dur="5.13">at this all these countries are going to</text>
  <text start="246.39" dur="5.91">look at this and say you know something</text>
  <text start="248.37" dur="7.05">maybe we would be better off if we</text>
  <text start="252.3" dur="7.47">create our own currency we control our</text>
  <text start="255.42" dur="8.55">own trade deals and we are completely</text>
  <text start="259.77" dur="6.3">separate and apart from the EU when you</text>
  <text start="263.97" dur="6.18">step back and you take a look at this</text>
  <text start="266.07" dur="8.4">what is Trump doing he&amp;#39;s destroying the</text>
  <text start="270.15" dur="5.64">central bank economic system now think</text>
  <text start="274.47" dur="4.32">about what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing here in the</text>
  <text start="275.79" dur="5.07">United States yes the stock market&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="278.79" dur="4.62">bobbing up and down but we knew this was</text>
  <text start="280.86" dur="4.77">going to happen what is Trump doing</text>
  <text start="283.41" dur="5.19">right now when the stock market goes</text>
  <text start="285.63" dur="5.94">down he blames the Fed when it goes back</text>
  <text start="288.6" dur="5.61">up it goes up pretty much to where it</text>
  <text start="291.57" dur="4.59">left off when it comes back down he</text>
  <text start="294.21" dur="2.799">blames the Fed again why is he doing</text>
  <text start="296.16" dur="3.55">this</text>
  <text start="297.009" dur="6.81">he wants the people to understand that</text>
  <text start="299.71" dur="7.349">the Fed is responsible for this economic</text>
  <text start="303.819" dur="5.07">system now we know that the stock market</text>
  <text start="307.059" dur="4.53">is not the economic system but we need</text>
  <text start="308.889" dur="5.76">to remember the mainstream media the</text>
  <text start="311.589" dur="5.13">central bank over many many years they</text>
  <text start="314.649" dur="4.651">made everyone believe through their</text>
  <text start="316.719" dur="5.4">brainwashing that yes the stock market</text>
  <text start="319.3" dur="4.349">is the economy no that is not the</text>
  <text start="322.119" dur="5.6">economy that&amp;#39;s not the people&amp;#39;s economy</text>
  <text start="323.649" dur="9.98">the people&amp;#39;s economy is the people</text>
  <text start="327.719" dur="11.741">buying goods having a job manufacturing</text>
  <text start="333.629" dur="10.451">that&amp;#39;s the people&amp;#39;s economy as the</text>
  <text start="339.46" dur="8.34">market continues to dip what happens to</text>
  <text start="344.08" dur="7.589">gold each time it moves up a little bit</text>
  <text start="347.8" dur="6.69">and what haven&amp;#39;t we seen so far we</text>
  <text start="351.669" dur="7.98">haven&amp;#39;t seen the paper contracts thrown</text>
  <text start="354.49" dur="9.03">at gold what does this tell you it tells</text>
  <text start="359.649" dur="6.901">you that this manipulation scam that</text>
  <text start="363.52" dur="6.869">they had going on it seems like it has</text>
  <text start="366.55" dur="5.849">come to an end now we&amp;#39;ll have to wait a</text>
  <text start="370.389" dur="5.82">little bit longer because if gold can</text>
  <text start="372.399" dur="8.091">get to 1600 to 1700 to 1800 without</text>
  <text start="376.209" dur="9.151">being slammed down we will know for sure</text>
  <text start="380.49" dur="8.079">that that manipulation is done which</text>
  <text start="385.36" dur="8.88">means the Patriots are in complete</text>
  <text start="388.569" dur="8.85">control of the system so if Trump brings</text>
  <text start="394.24" dur="7.88">the interest rates down to zero has</text>
  <text start="397.419" dur="6.84">complete control of the Fed Trump now is</text>
  <text start="402.12" dur="4.889">making all the calls that have to do</text>
  <text start="404.259" dur="5.4">with the economy and we need to remember</text>
  <text start="407.009" dur="5.65">when the mainstream media is out there</text>
  <text start="409.659" dur="4.35">and the reporting on the economy and I</text>
  <text start="412.659" dur="4.05">see a lot of them saying that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="414.009" dur="5.041">heading towards a recession where we</text>
  <text start="416.709" dur="4.11">need a recession this way Trump isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="419.05" dur="4.079">reelected I mean think about what</text>
  <text start="420.819" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re saying here they want the</text>
  <text start="423.129" dur="5.201">economy to crash so Trump is not</text>
  <text start="425.949" dur="5.141">reelected</text>
  <text start="428.33" dur="7.11">the economy is not going into a</text>
  <text start="431.09" dur="7.13">recession the economy is going to thrive</text>
  <text start="435.44" dur="6.509">right now and I&amp;#39;m talking statistically</text>
  <text start="438.22" dur="5.77">remember Trump is working with a central</text>
  <text start="441.949" dur="4.741">bank system which is based on an</text>
  <text start="443.99" dur="5.429">illusion and we talked about this in</text>
  <text start="446.69" dur="4.74">length how they manipulate the numbers</text>
  <text start="449.419" dur="4.59">and this has to do with unemployment GDP</text>
  <text start="451.43" dur="5.669">and everything else to make everyone</text>
  <text start="454.009" dur="8.101">believe that the system is doing really</text>
  <text start="457.099" dur="8.701">really well but the system the central</text>
  <text start="462.11" dur="6.66">bank system is dying and Trump needs to</text>
  <text start="465.8" dur="5.22">keep this dying system alive and the</text>
  <text start="468.77" dur="5.25">only way to do this is to use the magic</text>
  <text start="471.02" dur="5.359">wand to take control of the Fed to drop</text>
  <text start="474.02" dur="4.679">the interest rates to push stimulus</text>
  <text start="476.379" dur="6.88">because when you drop the interest rates</text>
  <text start="478.699" dur="7.44">what happens people they go out and they</text>
  <text start="483.259" dur="5.581">say now I can afford a house oh this is</text>
  <text start="486.139" dur="6.12">a good time to purchase a car oh this</text>
  <text start="488.84" dur="4.859">time I can send my child to college</text>
  <text start="492.259" dur="4.051">let&amp;#39;s say by taking out a student loan</text>
  <text start="493.699" dur="4.5">because the interest rates very low now</text>
  <text start="496.31" dur="4.5">everyone&amp;#39;s saying well isn&amp;#39;t this going</text>
  <text start="498.199" dur="5.791">to be bad later on because when the</text>
  <text start="500.81" dur="4.56">whole system comes down all these people</text>
  <text start="503.99" dur="6.419">are gonna be stuck with this real estate</text>
  <text start="505.37" dur="8.01">with these loans no Trump the Patriots</text>
  <text start="510.409" dur="6.42">they&amp;#39;re planning to do something with</text>
  <text start="513.38" dur="9.51">this debt remember this is a debt based</text>
  <text start="516.829" dur="9.771">system which was created by the central</text>
  <text start="522.89" dur="7.85">bank their system their whole entire</text>
  <text start="526.6" dur="7.599">system their economic system runs on</text>
  <text start="530.74" dur="8.289">debt and it&amp;#39;s a flawed system it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="534.199" dur="7.58">work over time this is why Trump and the</text>
  <text start="539.029" dur="6.781">Patriots they realize that they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="541.779" dur="6.911">move forward unless they have a parallel</text>
  <text start="545.81" dur="6.06">economy which is based on sound money</text>
  <text start="548.69" dur="5.519">and like Q has told us gold is going to</text>
  <text start="551.87" dur="5.159">destroy the Fed what do we see gold</text>
  <text start="554.209" dur="5.281">doing well in a very short period of</text>
  <text start="557.029" dur="5.041">time and went from 1,300 all the way up</text>
  <text start="559.49" dur="4.56">to 1500 now of course they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="562.07" dur="2.94">to move up too fast because people start</text>
  <text start="564.05" dur="3.57">saying we&amp;#39;ll wait a minute what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="565.01" dur="5.1">on here why is gold at 3,000 why is it</text>
  <text start="567.62" dur="5.4">at 5,000 is there something wrong here</text>
  <text start="570.11" dur="5.88">is the dollar worth zero well of course</text>
  <text start="573.02" dur="8.67">it is but they want to do this very very</text>
  <text start="575.99" dur="7.71">slowly almost like when the the petro</text>
  <text start="581.69" dur="4.56">dollar economy was coming online and</text>
  <text start="583.7" dur="5.67">nixon was saying oh look we have these</text>
  <text start="586.25" dur="5.22">gold speculators and this is really bad</text>
  <text start="589.37" dur="3.78">for the economy and we need to remove</text>
  <text start="591.47" dur="5.55">the united states off the gold because</text>
  <text start="593.15" dur="6.51">of this speculators they did this very</text>
  <text start="597.02" dur="5.07">very slowly over time and when the time</text>
  <text start="599.66" dur="5.46">was right they said okay now we have to</text>
  <text start="602.09" dur="4.56">pull the plug and let&amp;#39;s take the entire</text>
  <text start="605.12" dur="4.61">economic system off the gold standard</text>
  <text start="606.65" dur="5.04">and put it on the petro dollar system</text>
  <text start="609.73" dur="4.51">Trump and the Patriots are doing the</text>
  <text start="611.69" dur="4.62">same exact thing over time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="614.24" dur="5.22">letting gold move up slowly but surely</text>
  <text start="616.31" dur="5.19">and very soon they&amp;#39;re gonna do the</text>
  <text start="619.46" dur="4.65">opposite they&amp;#39;re gonna take us off the</text>
  <text start="621.5" dur="5.85">petro dollar system and move us back to</text>
  <text start="624.11" dur="6.08">the gold system and I do believe that</text>
  <text start="627.35" dur="7.29">with the restructuring of the Fed and</text>
  <text start="630.19" dur="7.45">with putting us on sound money they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="634.64" dur="6.27">going to take care of the debt problem</text>
  <text start="637.64" dur="6.42">because this was created by the central</text>
  <text start="640.91" dur="5.16">bank&amp;#39;s system and all those people that</text>
  <text start="644.06" dur="6.18">are holding assets I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="646.07" dur="7.44">going to be as bad as it would be if the</text>
  <text start="650.24" dur="7.59">deep state were in control which they</text>
  <text start="653.51" dur="7.2">are not the Patriots are in control so</text>
  <text start="657.83" dur="6.69">what we&amp;#39;re watching right now in real</text>
  <text start="660.71" dur="6.39">time is this destruction of the central</text>
  <text start="664.52" dur="4.65">bank system remember they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="667.1" dur="4.65">exposed they have no place to hide</text>
  <text start="669.17" dur="5.46">there is no event there is no war there</text>
  <text start="671.75" dur="6.42">is nothing like that where they can hide</text>
  <text start="674.63" dur="6.42">behind all of it to say oh it wasn&amp;#39;t us</text>
  <text start="678.17" dur="6.6">it was because it isn&amp;#39;t remember when a</text>
  <text start="681.05" dur="5.13">central bank system fails without having</text>
  <text start="684.77" dur="5.46">another system in place like a sound</text>
  <text start="686.18" dur="6.15">money system credit freezes up when</text>
  <text start="690.23" dur="4.2">credit freezes up</text>
  <text start="692.33" dur="4.32">guess what you don&amp;#39;t get you don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="694.43" dur="5.52">deliveries there&amp;#39;s no food on the</text>
  <text start="696.65" dur="4.59">shelves you see none of that this is why</text>
  <text start="699.95" dur="3.87">they need an event this is why they need</text>
  <text start="701.24" dur="5.67">a war because with a war they can say ah</text>
  <text start="703.82" dur="5.19">this is why you&amp;#39;re seeing no food on the</text>
  <text start="706.91" dur="4.92">shelves because we&amp;#39;re in a war situation</text>
  <text start="709.01" dur="5.58">oh this is why you&amp;#39;re not seeing fuel</text>
  <text start="711.83" dur="5.58">come into the country and you can&amp;#39;t gas</text>
  <text start="714.59" dur="5.88">up your car they have a way to explain</text>
  <text start="717.41" dur="3.78">it without that they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="720.47" dur="3.33">exposed</text>
  <text start="721.19" dur="5.73">but Trump and the Patriots they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="723.8" dur="6.21">planning to transition us from this debt</text>
