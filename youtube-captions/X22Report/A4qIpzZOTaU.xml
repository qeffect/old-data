  <text start="56.699" dur="5.45">report my name is David this is episode</text>
  <text start="59.269" dur="5.35">1618 B and today&amp;#39;s date of July 18th</text>
  <text start="62.149" dur="5.441">2018 and the title of the episode is</text>
  <text start="64.619" dur="5.911">boom the entire plan has been taken to</text>
  <text start="67.59" dur="4.65">the next level let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="70.53" dur="4.229">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="72.24" dur="3.3">geopolitical news now we know that Lisa</text>
  <text start="74.759" dur="3.301">Paige</text>
  <text start="75.54" dur="4.5">she has been testifying behind closed</text>
  <text start="78.06" dur="3.48">doors and some of the information that</text>
  <text start="80.04" dur="4.02">she has been talking about is now</text>
  <text start="81.54" dur="3.9">getting out and it looks like she might</text>
  <text start="84.06" dur="5.91">have flipped and she might be looking</text>
  <text start="85.44" dur="7.38">for some type of immunity deal now Lisa</text>
  <text start="89.97" dur="4.83">Paige basically taught tossed James</text>
  <text start="92.82" dur="6.089">Comey Andrew McCabe Peter struck and</text>
  <text start="94.8" dur="7.62">bill priest AB among others under the</text>
  <text start="98.909" dur="4.921">bus and what she went on to say was that</text>
  <text start="102.42" dur="4.399">these individuals</text>
  <text start="103.83" dur="7.62">well they concealed intelligence</text>
  <text start="106.819" dur="7.631">confirming Chinese state back assets had</text>
  <text start="111.45" dur="5.84">acquired of course illegally all this</text>
  <text start="114.45" dur="6.419">information from Hillary Clinton and</text>
  <text start="117.29" dur="6.91">they were able to access the emails and</text>
  <text start="120.869" dur="7.53">everything else so it looks like the</text>
  <text start="124.2" dur="6.839">Chinese actually did this and was it</text>
  <text start="128.399" dur="5.961">illegally accessed or to Clinton</text>
  <text start="131.039" dur="6.211">actually sell information to the Chinese</text>
  <text start="134.36" dur="4.21">I&amp;#39;m thinking that&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="137.25" dur="5.37">happened because all she had to do is</text>
  <text start="138.57" dur="6.57">leave the server unsecured and allow the</text>
  <text start="142.62" dur="4.619">Chinese to hack into it which would not</text>
  <text start="145.14" dur="4.469">be very difficult at all and to say I</text>
  <text start="147.239" dur="4.681">didn&amp;#39;t do anything they got into the</text>
  <text start="149.609" dur="5.701">system so from everything that Lisa</text>
  <text start="151.92" dur="4.89">Paige is saying and everything all the</text>
  <text start="155.31" dur="3.84">information that she&amp;#39;s putting out there</text>
  <text start="156.81" dur="4.049">it looks like she&amp;#39;s looking for an</text>
  <text start="159.15" dur="5.25">immunity deal it looks like she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="160.859" dur="5.97">cooperating and she might have flipped</text>
  <text start="164.4" dur="4.35">here and she&amp;#39;ll probably give more</text>
  <text start="166.829" dur="3.961">information now the deep state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="168.75" dur="4.109">very worried about this and we know that</text>
  <text start="170.79" dur="4.11">during the summer prior to the summit</text>
  <text start="172.859" dur="6.181">Mueller came out and indicted like 12</text>
  <text start="174.9" dur="7.919">Russians whatever and he knows Mueller</text>
  <text start="179.04" dur="8.09">knows that these Russians are not going</text>
  <text start="182.819" dur="7.341">to come to America he knows because</text>
  <text start="187.13" dur="5.85">under Russia&amp;#39;s Constitution it shields</text>
  <text start="190.16" dur="6.48">its citizens from extradition and</text>
  <text start="192.98" dur="5.25">deportation and the u.s. does not have</text>
  <text start="196.64" dur="4.26">an extradition treaty with Russia</text>
  <text start="198.23" dur="5.49">artists article 61 of the Russian</text>
  <text start="200.9" dur="5.61">Constitution forbids extradition a</text>
  <text start="203.72" dur="4.61">citizen of the Russian Federation may</text>
  <text start="206.51" dur="4.62">not be deported from Russia or</text>
  <text start="208.33" dur="5.83">extradited to another state so Putin</text>
  <text start="211.13" dur="4.71">came out and he denied that those named</text>
  <text start="214.16" dur="3.51">in the indictment were working on behalf</text>
  <text start="215.84" dur="3.84">of his government he said that the</text>
  <text start="217.67" dur="3.93">Russian government could question those</text>
  <text start="219.68" dur="5.16">accused of electrum meddling if the US</text>
  <text start="221.6" dur="5.79">and Muller utilized the 1999 mutual</text>
  <text start="224.84" dur="5.19">legal assistance in criminal matters and</text>
  <text start="227.39" dur="5.16">that is a criminal matters treaty that</text>
  <text start="230.03" dur="5.13">he&amp;#39;s talking about he can use this</text>
  <text start="232.55" dur="7.17">treaty he said as a solid foundation and</text>
  <text start="235.16" dur="7.23">send formal an official request to us so</text>
  <text start="239.72" dur="4.56">that we could interrogate we would hold</text>
  <text start="242.39" dur="4.14">the questioning of these individuals who</text>
  <text start="244.28" dur="4.11">he believes are privy to some crimes and</text>
  <text start="246.53" dur="4.26">our law enforcement are perfectly able</text>
  <text start="248.39" dur="3.63">to do this questioning and send the</text>
  <text start="250.79" dur="3.63">appropriate materials to the United</text>
  <text start="252.02" dur="6.66">States actually Putin went a step</text>
  <text start="254.42" dur="7.05">further he said that he will allow US</text>
  <text start="258.68" dur="5.88">officials and members of Mueller&amp;#39;s team</text>
  <text start="261.47" dur="6.66">to be present at the questioning if the</text>
  <text start="264.56" dur="5.67">US would reciprocate and allow Russian</text>
  <text start="268.13" dur="3.66">officials to be present at the</text>
  <text start="270.23" dur="4.62">questioning of certain US intelligence</text>
  <text start="271.79" dur="5.55">and law enforcement officials well I</text>
  <text start="274.85" dur="5.1">think this should be done do you think</text>
  <text start="277.34" dur="5.57">Mueller&amp;#39;s gonna go for this most likely</text>
  <text start="279.95" dur="7.02">not and this would be Mueller&amp;#39;s worst</text>
  <text start="282.91" dur="7.66">nightmare now Mueller he&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="286.97" dur="5.01">process of protecting his people because</text>
  <text start="290.57" dur="3.18">from now right now what we&amp;#39;re hearing is</text>
  <text start="291.98" dur="4.86">that Mueller is seeking immunity for</text>
  <text start="293.75" dur="4.41">five witnesses against Manta Ford and we</text>
  <text start="296.84" dur="4.59">know that manna fort was a plant</text>
  <text start="298.16" dur="5.79">according to Q so Special Counsel Robert</text>
  <text start="301.43" dur="5.18">Mueller team is asking a federal judge</text>
  <text start="303.95" dur="6">to grant immunity to five witnesses who</text>
  <text start="306.61" dur="6.76">may be called to testify at the upcoming</text>
  <text start="309.95" dur="7.05">trial of Paul Manafort now we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="313.37" dur="7.319">who these individuals are but we suspect</text>
  <text start="317" dur="7.349">two of them these two key witnesses</text>
  <text start="320.689" dur="5.641">they might be the Podesta brothers now</text>
  <text start="324.349" dur="5.22">think about what Mueller is doing right</text>
  <text start="326.33" dur="6.719">now he&amp;#39;s protecting certain individuals</text>
  <text start="329.569" dur="5.28">and giving them immunity because he</text>
  <text start="333.049" dur="5.55">knows everything that he&amp;#39;s doing right</text>
  <text start="334.849" dur="7.02">now is completely falling apart it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="338.599" dur="6.36">propaganda let&amp;#39;s see if Mueller takes</text>
  <text start="341.869" dur="5.97">Putin up on this interrogation because</text>
  <text start="344.959" dur="4.47">under the Russian Constitution they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="347.839" dur="5.42">not going to send anyone here but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="349.429" dur="5.79">allowing Mueller to come over there and</text>
  <text start="353.259" dur="4.72">question these individuals</text>
  <text start="355.219" dur="6.09">now if Mueller is serious this is what</text>
  <text start="357.979" dur="6.72">he would do and let&amp;#39;s see if this goes</text>
  <text start="361.309" dur="5.22">to the next step let&amp;#39;s see if he follows</text>
  <text start="364.699" dur="3.45">through on this because we see what we</text>
  <text start="366.529" dur="4.5">saw what happened when the Russian</text>
  <text start="368.149" dur="6.151">company came here to the u.s. Mueller he</text>
  <text start="371.029" dur="5.04">was scrambling he had no evidence he</text>
  <text start="374.3" dur="4.049">couldn&amp;#39;t produce anything still can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="376.069" dur="3.66">and the Russian company is sitting there</text>
  <text start="378.349" dur="4.2">going okay let&amp;#39;s do this</text>
  <text start="379.729" dur="6.9">it&amp;#39;s his worst nightmare now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="382.549" dur="7.05">interesting is that the deep State they</text>
  <text start="386.629" dur="4.32">are reeling they&amp;#39;re very nervous about</text>
  <text start="389.599" dur="4.14">what is happening and we know that Trump</text>
  <text start="390.949" dur="4.71">has met with Putin and they talked about</text>
  <text start="393.739" dur="4.621">many different things one of the things</text>
  <text start="395.659" dur="4.951">that came out was that Trump believed</text>
  <text start="398.36" dur="4.619">Putin when he said he didn&amp;#39;t interfere</text>
  <text start="400.61" dur="3.69">in the u.s. elections and of course the</text>
  <text start="402.979" dur="3.09">mainstream media the deep state they</text>
  <text start="404.3" dur="3.989">were out there saying that oh look</text>
  <text start="406.069" dur="5.52">Trump is siding with a foreign leader</text>
  <text start="408.289" dur="5.7">over the intelligence agencies well this</text>
  <text start="411.589" dur="5.16">is not exactly what is happening he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="413.989" dur="6.03">not siding with a foreign leader over</text>
  <text start="416.749" dur="7.25">the entire US intelligence agencies he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="420.019" dur="6.87">siding with Putin over those certain</text>
  <text start="423.999" dur="5.74">individuals in the attendant agencies</text>
  <text start="426.889" dur="5.37">that are corrupt that are criminals so</text>
  <text start="429.739" dur="4.89">Trump was going to clear this up and he</text>
  <text start="432.259" dur="5.31">was having a press conference and he</text>
  <text start="434.629" dur="4.5">expressed how he really felt about the</text>
  <text start="437.569" dur="3.481">u.s. intelligence he&amp;#39;s where he said he</text>
  <text start="439.129" dur="4.41">had the full faith in US intelligence</text>
  <text start="441.05" dur="5.579">agencies and then all of a sudden out of</text>
  <text start="443.539" dur="6.15">nowhere the lights suddenly went out and</text>
  <text start="446.629" dur="5.13">this is not the first time a mention of</text>
  <text start="449.689" dur="4.511">the US intelligence agencies was filed</text>
  <text start="451.759" dur="6.671">followed by an unexpected black</text>
  <text start="454.2" dur="5.82">and if we go back to 2016 when Putin was</text>
  <text start="458.43" dur="4.23">commenting on the sidelines of a BRICS</text>
  <text start="460.02" dur="4.89">summit in India about the US National</text>
  <text start="462.66" dur="4.26">Security Agency wiretapping journalists</text>
  <text start="464.91" dur="3.99">and the possibility of cyberattacks</text>
  <text start="466.92" dur="4.56">against Russia the lights in the room</text>
  <text start="468.9" dur="5.16">suddenly went out as Putin expressed a</text>
  <text start="471.48" dur="5.97">desire to have friendly relations with</text>
  <text start="474.06" dur="4.98">the US and Putin was out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="477.45" dur="3.54">saying oh something happened the lights</text>
  <text start="479.04" dur="4.2">went dark Trump said the same thing oh</text>
  <text start="480.99" dur="5.37">look at this the lights went down the</text>
  <text start="483.24" dur="5.46">power was also cut during Secretary of</text>
  <text start="486.36" dur="5.04">State Mike Pompeo Senate confirmation</text>
  <text start="488.7" dur="4.68">hearing last year the lights went out as</text>
  <text start="491.4" dur="4.23">Senator Mark Warner was speaking about</text>
  <text start="493.38" dur="4.26">alleged Russian interference in the 2016</text>
  <text start="495.63" dur="3.9">presidential election adding to the</text>
  <text start="497.64" dur="4.62">conspiracy theories that dimming the</text>
  <text start="499.53" dur="6.81">lights might be a subtle CIA tactic to</text>
  <text start="502.26" dur="5.22">signal its omnipotence now this is very</text>
  <text start="506.34" dur="3.06">interesting now I know the mainstream</text>
  <text start="507.48" dur="4.32">media is out there and they&amp;#39;re making a</text>
  <text start="509.4" dur="6">really big deal about Trump meeting</text>
  <text start="511.8" dur="6.59">Putin but if we look back in time there</text>
  <text start="515.4" dur="6.36">are many many instances when other</text>
  <text start="518.39" dur="7.27">presidents have met Putin I mean we have</text>
  <text start="521.76" dur="6.93">Obama with Putin we have George W Bush</text>
  <text start="525.66" dur="4.89">with Putin we have Clinton with Putin</text>
  <text start="528.69" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s Bill Clinton we have Hillary</text>
  <text start="530.55" dur="6.9">Clinton with Putin we have senior Bush</text>
  <text start="532.98" dur="7.32">with Putin I mean all these leaders have</text>
  <text start="537.45" dur="6.18">met Putin now did the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="540.3" dur="5.09">act the way they did when Trump met with</text>
  <text start="543.63" dur="5.4">Putin no they did not</text>
  <text start="545.39" dur="7.36">this is how you know this has nothing to</text>
  <text start="549.03" dur="9.9">do with Putin this has to do with what</text>
  <text start="552.75" dur="9.23">is about to happen now allegedly there</text>
  <text start="558.93" dur="6.66">is word coming out when Putin met Trump</text>
  <text start="561.98" dur="6.07">Putin has about a hundred sixty</text>
  <text start="565.59" dur="5.22">terabytes of communication intercepts</text>
  <text start="568.05" dur="5.34">all the people behind fake Russian</text>
  <text start="570.81" dur="5.85">collusion false flag chemical attacks in</text>
  <text start="573.39" dur="4.83">Syria sabotage for the brexit Clinton</text>
  <text start="576.66" dur="5.49">activities and much much more</text>
  <text start="578.22" dur="5.91">and it looks like he handed this over to</text>
  <text start="582.15" dur="4.71">trump now some of those intercepts</text>
  <text start="584.13" dur="3.83">reveal who has been financing weapons</text>
  <text start="586.86" dur="3.56">supplies travel</text>
  <text start="587.96" dur="4.56">tell vehicle rentals and say and secure</text>
  <text start="590.42" dur="5.61">communications gear for terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="592.52" dur="5.19">inside Syria Iraq and other areas among</text>
  <text start="596.03" dur="5.49">the intercepted communications are</text>
  <text start="597.71" dur="6.18">mostly international phone calls faxes</text>
  <text start="601.52" dur="2.91">emails by members of the US Congress US</text>
  <text start="603.89" dur="4.17">Senate</text>
  <text start="604.43" dur="6.75">federal judges now remember each country</text>
  <text start="608.06" dur="4.77">spies on each other now some of these</text>
  <text start="611.18" dur="4.5">communications were encrypted and some</text>
  <text start="612.83" dur="5.1">were not and it looks like through the</text>
  <text start="615.68" dur="5.13">backdoors thanks to the intelligence</text>
  <text start="617.93" dur="5.55">agencies that they created it looks like</text>
  <text start="620.81" dur="6.12">Russia was able to use these to get the</text>
  <text start="623.48" dur="5.28">information and it seems that Trump has</text>
  <text start="626.93" dur="5.49">this information now we understand from</text>
  <text start="628.76" dur="5.43">cue they have the DNC DNC server they</text>
  <text start="632.42" dur="4.17">have the emails they have the data from</text>
  <text start="634.19" dur="5.64">WikiLeaks and now they have the data</text>
  <text start="636.59" dur="5.73">from Russia now we know these other</text>
  <text start="639.83" dur="5.01">countries they especially Russia they</text>
  <text start="642.32" dur="5.58">know exactly what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="644.84" dur="5.67">because if these individuals within the</text>
  <text start="647.9" dur="5.16">US are dealing with outside entities in</text>
  <text start="650.51" dur="5.58">other countries their communications are</text>
  <text start="653.06" dur="5.16">going to be intercepted and this is</text>
  <text start="656.09" dur="4.59">exactly what has happened and you can</text>
  <text start="658.22" dur="4.02">see that most of these individuals well</text>
  <text start="660.68" dur="4.11">they weren&amp;#39;t really encrypting and those</text>
  <text start="662.24" dur="4.11">that were encrypting the encryption was</text>
  <text start="664.79" dur="3.57">broken because all the backdoors and</text>
  <text start="666.35" dur="4.11">thank you very much intelligent agencies</text>
  <text start="668.36" dur="5.55">for doing that it just you just helped</text>
  <text start="670.46" dur="5.43">them seal the deal against yourself I</text>
  <text start="673.91" dur="6.06">mean think about what is happening here</text>
  <text start="675.89" dur="5.7">now to take this all a step further the</text>
  <text start="679.97" dur="4.47">Trump administration announced it was</text>
  <text start="681.59" dur="5.88">going to launch a probe whether uranium</text>
  <text start="684.44" dur="4.95">imports threaten national security now</text>
  <text start="687.47" dur="4.53">let&amp;#39;s think about this a second because</text>
  <text start="689.39" dur="5.19">we know Clinton in is involved in the</text>
  <text start="692" dur="4.11">uranium one deal Q has been telling us</text>
  <text start="694.58" dur="5.7">what they&amp;#39;ve been doing with the uranium</text>
  <text start="696.11" dur="7.29">and right now there&amp;#39;s a probe which is</text>
  <text start="700.28" dur="6.15">going to look into uranium imports now</text>
  <text start="703.4" dur="4.34">of course the story the cover story</text>
  <text start="706.43" dur="3.81">which I do believe is a cover story</text>
  <text start="707.74" dur="5.02">they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re doing this for</text>

  <text start="776.62" dur="5.67">don&amp;#39;t know what to do because now</text>
  <text start="778" dur="7.08">there&amp;#39;s a uranium probe they have the</text>

  <text start="787.6" dur="6.84">are flipping now Putin is telling Muller</text>
  <text start="791.38" dur="6.93">to come over to Russia to interrogate</text>
  <text start="794.44" dur="6.21">those people he indicted I mean think</text>
  <text start="798.31" dur="3.75">about what is happening here the whole</text>
  <text start="800.65" dur="3.12">thing&amp;#39;s falling apart now if we move out</text>
  <text start="802.06" dur="3.54">to the Middle East we understand that</text>
  <text start="803.77" dur="3.42">things are falling apart rapidly for the</text>
  <text start="805.6" dur="4.29">deep state in the Middle East we know</text>
  <text start="807.19" dur="6.18">out in Afghanistan Ghani has been trying</text>
  <text start="809.89" dur="5.1">to have peace deals with the Taliban not</text>
  <text start="813.37" dur="3.09">going so well so it looks like the Trump</text>
  <text start="814.99" dur="4.17">administration is going to be getting</text>
  <text start="816.46" dur="4.62">involved now Ghani is saying that listen</text>
  <text start="819.16" dur="3.93">we want to handle this ourselves and</text>
  <text start="821.08" dur="2.73">remember how to gotta get into this</text>
  <text start="823.09" dur="2.52">position</text>
  <text start="823.81" dur="3.42">well John Kerry was there during the</text>
  <text start="825.61" dur="4.08">elections help this individual get in</text>
  <text start="827.23" dur="4.77">there because they needed a bilateral</text>
  <text start="829.69" dur="5.46">security agreement to allow the troops</text>
  <text start="832" dur="4.17">to stay in Afghanistan and this</text>
  <text start="835.15" dur="3.66">individual Ghani</text>
  <text start="836.17" dur="4.98">well they pushed him to become president</text>
  <text start="838.81" dur="5.82">he became president to help John Kerry</text>
  <text start="841.15" dur="5.4">and he signed that deal because they</text>
  <text start="844.63" dur="4.71">knew they needed to keep the troops in</text>
  <text start="846.55" dur="4.5">there they knew that the troops were</text>
  <text start="849.34" dur="4.39">never going to come out of Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="851.05" dur="7.209">they&amp;#39;re protecting the poppy fields</text>
  <text start="853.73" dur="6">so right now it looks like the leaders</text>
  <text start="858.259" dur="5.94">of Afghanistan they want to take the</text>
  <text start="859.73" dur="6.389">lead on the peace talks and the u.s.</text>
  <text start="864.199" dur="3.36">wants to push this agenda forward</text>
  <text start="866.119" dur="4.26">because what they&amp;#39;re really looking to</text>
  <text start="867.559" dur="5.911">do is they&amp;#39;re looking to participate and</text>
  <text start="870.379" dur="7.14">they&amp;#39;re looking to have actual peace</text>
  <text start="873.47" dur="5.849">talks yes in the past all this talk</text>
  <text start="877.519" dur="4.021">about peace and things like that was</text>
  <text start="879.319" dur="5.85">about protecting the poppy fields was to</text>
  <text start="881.54" dur="6.419">keep the war going but from the actions</text>
  <text start="885.169" dur="6.65">of what Trump and the Patriots have been</text>
  <text start="887.959" dur="7.23">doing we can see that North Korea no war</text>
  <text start="891.819" dur="5.38">Syria that is coming to an end and the</text>
  <text start="895.189" dur="3.721">troops will be coming home same thing in</text>
  <text start="897.199" dur="4.74">Iraq so everything that we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="898.91" dur="4.169">right now is the opposite of what we</text>
  <text start="901.939" dur="3.81">experienced before</text>
  <text start="903.079" dur="4.85">before the deep state had the control</text>
  <text start="905.749" dur="6.57">they controlled the narrative of</text>
  <text start="907.929" dur="8.44">everything now they don&amp;#39;t the opposite</text>
  <text start="912.319" dur="5.221">is happening when Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="916.369" dur="2.88">are talking about bringing the troops</text>
  <text start="917.54" dur="3.69">home they&amp;#39;re really talking about</text>
  <text start="919.249" dur="3.33">bringing the troops home when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="921.23" dur="4.199">talking about having peace in North</text>
  <text start="922.579" dur="4.47">Korea and having no war and having a</text>
  <text start="925.429" dur="4.11">peace summit they&amp;#39;re really talking</text>
  <text start="927.049" dur="4.051">about having a peace deal and a summit</text>
  <text start="929.539" dur="3.45">when they&amp;#39;re talking about peace in</text>
  <text start="931.1" dur="4.079">Afghanistan and bringing this war one of</text>
  <text start="932.989" dur="4.53">17 years to an end they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="935.179" dur="4.02">talking about having this war come to an</text>
  <text start="937.519" dur="3.6">end when they&amp;#39;re talking about going</text>
  <text start="939.199" dur="3.36">after the Islamic state yes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="941.119" dur="3.42">going after the deep state paid</text>
  <text start="942.559" dur="4.23">mercenary army the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="944.539" dur="5.431">al-qaida al-nusra remember all of these</text>
  <text start="946.789" dur="6.811">entities they were created by the deep</text>
  <text start="949.97" dur="9.599">state to push their agenda now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="953.6" dur="8.37">being destroyed and right now Russia has</text>
  <text start="959.569" dur="4.71">been asked by Trump and they both agreed</text>
  <text start="961.97" dur="5.849">to help out with North Korea now I think</text>
  <text start="964.279" dur="5.46">Russia was always part of this and I</text>
  <text start="967.819" dur="3.781">think it&amp;#39;s just being released to the</text>
  <text start="969.739" dur="5.25">public now I think China Russia they</text>
  <text start="971.6" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;ve always worked with the u.s. to</text>
  <text start="974.989" dur="4.111">help with the peace negotiations in</text>
  <text start="976.85" dur="3.989">North Korea and I think what Trump is</text>
  <text start="979.1" dur="3.419">doing right now is he&amp;#39;s just bringing</text>
  <text start="980.839" dur="4.95">this out into the open and saying that</text>
  <text start="982.519" dur="5.141">Russia is going to be involved in the</text>
  <text start="985.789" dur="4.581">talks with north</text>
  <text start="987.66" dur="6.16">going to be working with the president</text>
  <text start="990.37" dur="7.279">of North Korea and Russia went out and</text>
  <text start="993.82" dur="7.95">they agreed to help with this process</text>
  <text start="997.649" dur="5.921">out in Syria we see more weapons have</text>
  <text start="1001.77" dur="4.35">been confiscated from the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1003.57" dur="5.04">the paid mercenary army and a lot of</text>
  <text start="1006.12" dur="5.67">these weapons are is really made there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1008.61" dur="6.84">bombs there&amp;#39;s other type of weapons a</text>
  <text start="1011.79" dur="6.419">lot of weapons been found from France</text>
  <text start="1015.45" dur="5.6">from the UK from the US and they were</text>
  <text start="1018.209" dur="7.171">all in the hands of the terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="1021.05" dur="7.659">why because they supported them so what</text>
  <text start="1025.38" dur="7.29">we see happening right now is Putin</text>
  <text start="1028.709" dur="8.401">Trump and everyone else they&amp;#39;re calling</text>
  <text start="1032.67" dur="7.139">the deep state on their propaganda with</text>
  <text start="1037.11" dur="5.01">the indictments they just called out</text>
  <text start="1039.809" dur="5.341">Muller and said go ahead come on over</text>
  <text start="1042.12" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;ll allow this with everything else</text>
  <text start="1045.15" dur="4.44">with the Middle East and everything else</text>
  <text start="1047.13" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re calling them out on at every</text>
  <text start="1049.59" dur="5.37">turn and what&amp;#39;s going to happen is the</text>
  <text start="1052.53" dur="3.6">deep state is either just gonna fold and</text>
  <text start="1054.96" dur="2.31">that&amp;#39;s gonna be it</text>
  <text start="1056.13" dur="3.09">which I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="1057.27" dur="3.659">because they never do that I think</text>
  <text start="1059.22" dur="2.61">they&amp;#39;re gonna push something and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1060.929" dur="3.031">gonna push it hard</text>
  <text start="1061.83" dur="3.96">what that will be we don&amp;#39;t know as of</text>
  <text start="1063.96" dur="4.14">yet but we can see that they were</text>
  <text start="1065.79" dur="4.26">planning on riots they might be planning</text>
  <text start="1068.1" dur="4.2">on a civil war even though Q said there</text>
  <text start="1070.05" dur="5.04">will be no civil war the deep state will</text>
  <text start="1072.3" dur="4.61">try something and if all else fails they</text>
  <text start="1075.09" dur="4.589">might even try something even larger</text>
  <text start="1076.91" dur="5.2">something on the magnitude of 911</text>
  <text start="1079.679" dur="3.75">something like that it might have to do</text>
  <text start="1082.11" dur="3.09">with a cyber attack with physical</text>
  <text start="1083.429" dur="4.201">attacks but we can see that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1085.2" dur="4.17">just gonna lay down and take it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1087.63" dur="4.86">gonna come back because if they do</text>
  <text start="1089.37" dur="4.92">decide to just give up what happens well</text>
  <text start="1092.49" dur="3.96">it looks like Ben they&amp;#39;ll have to stand</text>
  <text start="1094.29" dur="5.16">trial and you know they don&amp;#39;t want to do</text>
  <text start="1096.45" dur="6.99">that or they&amp;#39;ll run or they&amp;#39;ll commit</text>
  <text start="1099.45" dur="7.02">suicide so time is ticking down now for</text>
  <text start="1103.44" dur="6.56">the deep state and before you know it</text>

  <text start="1112.77" dur="5.67">declassified once that happens I believe</text>
  <text start="1115.95" dur="4.41">this is game over</text>
  <text start="1118.44" dur="5.04">this is the part we should be worried</text>
  <text start="1120.36" dur="6.6">about because the deep state will not</text>
  <text start="1123.48" dur="5.25">let it get that far without doing</text>
  <text start="1126.96" dur="4.62">something without some type of an event</text>
  <text start="1128.73" dur="6.6">to distract from that because that is</text>
  <text start="1131.58" dur="5.699">something they don&amp;#39;t want out there so</text>
  <text start="1135.33" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;ll have to monitor the situation we</text>
  <text start="1137.279" dur="4.89">can see right now the deep state they&amp;#39;re</text>
