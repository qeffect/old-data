  <text start="122.49" dur="6.42">get into the economic collapse news what</text>
  <text start="125.429" dur="7.021">we&amp;#39;re seeing out in Greece is that since</text>
  <text start="128.91" dur="5.85">the unemployment rate is so high it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="132.45" dur="4.89">around twenty seven percent and what</text>
  <text start="134.76" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that twenty</text>
  <text start="137.34" dur="4.08">five percent of the Greek people</text>
  <text start="139.59" dur="4.56">are either not on health insurance</text>
  <text start="141.42" dur="5.01">anymore or can&amp;#39;t afford health coverage</text>
  <text start="144.15" dur="4.11">and what it&amp;#39;s happening it&amp;#39;s putting</text>
  <text start="146.43" dur="6.419">children and pregnant women in danger</text>
  <text start="148.26" dur="6.869">and the people out in Greece are they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="152.849" dur="4.651">very worried about the number of people</text>
  <text start="155.129" dur="5.821">who have lost access to social insurance</text>
  <text start="157.5" dur="5.519">and what we are seeing is that on</text>
  <text start="160.95" dur="5.069">average three women out of ten between</text>
  <text start="163.019" dur="5.97">the ages of 25 and 44 are out of work</text>
  <text start="166.019" dur="5.131">men are out of work and we&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="168.989" dur="4.201">total unemployment around twenty-seven</text>
  <text start="171.15" dur="5.58">percent the youth unemployment is above</text>
  <text start="173.19" dur="7.139">sixty percent so again this is very</text>
  <text start="176.73" dur="6.78">tough out there and we see that the</text>
  <text start="180.329" dur="7.861">methods of the central bank do not work</text>
  <text start="183.51" dur="8.13">bailing out bailing in austerity gives</text>
  <text start="188.19" dur="6.42">you high unemployment it gives you</text>
  <text start="191.64" dur="5.939">higher debt and it makes the people</text>
  <text start="194.61" dur="5.58">suffer so there is no good in what is</text>
  <text start="197.579" dur="5.791">happening out there and right now Cyprus</text>
  <text start="200.19" dur="5.82">is to get the third tranche of a hundred</text>
  <text start="203.37" dur="5.399">million euro the Eurogroup has approved</text>
  <text start="206.01" dur="5.37">a third bailout for Cyprus of a hundred</text>
  <text start="208.769" dur="4.651">million euro before the end of 2013 and</text>
  <text start="211.38" dur="3.75">we have to remember that cybers to do</text>
  <text start="213.42" dur="4.92">the balance so they have balance and</text>
  <text start="215.13" dur="5.79">bailouts and they still cannot get this</text>
  <text start="218.34" dur="4.679">going here in Cyprus because they are</text>
  <text start="220.92" dur="5.67">heading down the same path as Greece and</text>
  <text start="223.019" dur="6.601">if we look at other countries like</text>
  <text start="226.59" dur="6.269">France and Portugal and Spain and Italy</text>
  <text start="229.62" dur="5.549">we are seeing the same exact things we</text>
  <text start="232.859" dur="4.651">are seeing it take effect in Germany and</text>
  <text start="235.169" dur="3.9">in UK and in the u.s. we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="237.51" dur="3.599">manipulating all the numbers completely</text>
  <text start="239.069" dur="4.23">so everyone is oblivious to what is</text>
  <text start="241.109" dur="4.74">really happening here and all eyes on</text>
  <text start="243.299" dur="4.921">the stock market and hopefully the dial</text>
  <text start="245.849" dur="3.871">the SP and Nasdaq keep going higher and</text>
  <text start="248.22" dur="4.47">people believe that everything is</text>
  <text start="249.72" dur="5.28">getting better so the United States</text>
  <text start="252.69" dur="6.09">right now the central bankers need</text>
  <text start="255" dur="6.359">revenue they&amp;#39;re looking for money and</text>
  <text start="258.78" dur="5.759">they&amp;#39;re get they have given the Swiss</text>
  <text start="261.359" dur="7.291">banks a deadline to disclose hidden</text>
  <text start="264.539" dur="6.391">assets to the US and about 300 to expect</text>
  <text start="268.65" dur="4.23">Swiss banks had until the end of Monday</text>
  <text start="270.93" dur="2.43">to determine whether to give United</text>
  <text start="272.88" dur="4.409">States</text>
  <text start="273.36" dur="5.91">records of Americans hiding assets there</text>
  <text start="277.289" dur="5.28">as Washington threatens institutions</text>
  <text start="279.27" dur="5.28">with legal action and also penalties if</text>
  <text start="282.569" dur="5.041">they do not disclose this information</text>
  <text start="284.55" dur="5.579">and pursuant to a deal between the</text>
  <text start="287.61" dur="5.01">nation&amp;#39;s Swiss banks can avoid us</text>
  <text start="290.129" dur="4.741">prosecution by volunteering account</text>
  <text start="292.62" dur="5.16">information on American clients along</text>
  <text start="294.87" dur="5.099">with paying a fine the penalty equals</text>
  <text start="297.78" dur="4.889">between twenty and fifty percent of the</text>
  <text start="299.969" dur="5.19">value of the undeclared accounts based</text>
  <text start="302.669" dur="5.55">on when they were conceived if a bank</text>
  <text start="305.159" dur="6.211">opened up an undeclared account before</text>
  <text start="308.219" dur="6.361">2009 when the Swiss bank giant ubs was</text>
  <text start="311.37" dur="5.819">fine 780 million by the US for tax</text>
  <text start="314.58" dur="4.85">evasion it would have faced a lower</text>
  <text start="317.189" dur="6.69">penalty so they are looking everywhere</text>
  <text start="319.43" dur="7.66">for money and right now most of the</text>
  <text start="323.879" dur="5.16">larger banks are cooperating and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="327.09" dur="4.349">going along with this and some of the</text>
  <text start="329.039" dur="7.38">smaller banks aren&amp;#39;t and one of the</text>
  <text start="331.439" dur="7.26">banks that agreed to the the u.s.</text>
  <text start="336.419" dur="4.291">pressure who was being pressured of</text>
  <text start="338.699" dur="5.701">course by giving over this information</text>
  <text start="340.71" dur="6.56">was the Swiss original lender a valiant</text>
  <text start="344.4" dur="7.319">bank was has agreed to voluntarily</text>
  <text start="347.27" dur="7.179">disclose those people who put money into</text>
  <text start="351.719" dur="6.931">the bank who have been avoiding taxes</text>
  <text start="354.449" dur="6.39">and the Swiss financial regulator finma</text>
  <text start="358.65" dur="4.71">is expecting a number of banks to agree</text>
  <text start="360.839" dur="5.58">to the u.s. clearance examination on any</text>
  <text start="363.36" dur="5.339">past transit transgressions and faces</text>
  <text start="366.419" dur="5.641">fines which can be up to fifty percent</text>
  <text start="368.699" dur="5.611">of the assets depending on how these</text>
  <text start="372.06" dur="4.65">banks acted in their dealings with</text>
  <text start="374.31" dur="4.079">American customers so we can see what</text>
  <text start="376.71" dur="5.069">the central bankers are doing right now</text>
  <text start="378.389" dur="7.77">they need money the US government needs</text>
  <text start="381.779" dur="7.11">the money to sustain the huge amount of</text>
  <text start="386.159" dur="4.921">debt that is taken on by the US</text>
  <text start="388.889" dur="4.74">government because they cannot slow this</text>
  <text start="391.08" dur="5.19">down they cannot pay the interest on</text>
  <text start="393.629" dur="4.47">this debt with the tax revenues from the</text>
  <text start="396.27" dur="5.97">people so now they are looking</text>
  <text start="398.099" dur="5.61">everywhere for this money now there was</text>
  <text start="402.24" dur="4.53">an article out from the New York Times</text>
  <text start="403.709" dur="6.511">and what they reported is that the</text>
  <text start="406.77" dur="8.22">the number of children who are homeless</text>
  <text start="410.22" dur="6.569">right now is now more than when the</text>
  <text start="414.99" dur="4.5">Great Depression happened there are</text>
  <text start="416.789" dur="5.37">about 1.2 million public school kids in</text>
  <text start="419.49" dur="5.91">America that are homeless and that</text>
  <text start="422.159" dur="6.151">number has gone up by about seventy two</text>
  <text start="425.4" dur="6.12">percent since the the start of the last</text>
  <text start="428.31" dur="4.919">recession so right now we&amp;#39;re not in a</text>
  <text start="431.52" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;re coming out of the recession it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="433.229" dur="4.59">recovery we&amp;#39;re not in a depression but</text>
  <text start="435.72" dur="4.47">there&amp;#39;s 1.2 million public school kids</text>
  <text start="437.819" dur="6.211">that are homeless and this is more than</text>
  <text start="440.19" dur="7.61">the Great Depression but not to worry</text>
  <text start="444.03" dur="7.83">the Fed is going to help the country out</text>
  <text start="447.8" dur="8.109">the president has come out and said that</text>
  <text start="451.86" dur="8.76">the Fed is putting the Volcker Volcker</text>
  <text start="455.909" dur="7.021">Rule into place and this will be a this</text>
  <text start="460.62" dur="4.68">will allow the banks to self regulate</text>
  <text start="462.93" dur="4.769">themselves and this goes on to say that</text>
  <text start="465.3" dur="4.619">it requires banking entities to</text>
  <text start="467.699" dur="4.831">establish an internal compliance program</text>
  <text start="469.919" dur="5.131">designed to help ensure and monitor</text>
  <text start="472.53" dur="4.59">compliance with their prohibitions and</text>
  <text start="475.05" dur="5.64">restrictions of the statute and the</text>
  <text start="477.12" dur="7.71">final rule and right now the vocal rule</text>
  <text start="480.69" dur="6.509">passed by all five regulators and Obama</text>
  <text start="484.83" dur="6.269">says this rule will make financial</text>
  <text start="487.199" dur="7.951">system much safer and it will help the</text>
  <text start="491.099" dur="6.421">American people hmm I just can&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="495.15" dur="5.489">him right now and for banks to be</text>
  <text start="497.52" dur="6.119">self-regulating themselves that is not</text>
  <text start="500.639" dur="7.801">going to work whatsoever this is a BS</text>
  <text start="503.639" dur="8.371">rule and this will not do anything with</text>
  <text start="508.44" dur="6.389">what&amp;#39;s going on right now now South</text>

  <text start="532.74" dur="5.099">looking to go forward and to be passed</text>
  <text start="535.079" dur="4.86">and put into law and what the supreme</text>
  <text start="537.839" dur="4.68">court said in Prince verse</text>
  <text start="539.939" dur="4.77">United States is that states are not</text>
  <text start="542.519" dur="4.17">merely political subdivisions of the</text>
  <text start="544.709" dur="3.9">federal government to carry out what the</text>
  <text start="546.689" dur="5.34">federal government does they are</text>
  <text start="548.609" dur="6.361">sovereign entities and Congress can pass</text>
  <text start="552.029" dur="5.28">laws but it cannot compel the states to</text>
  <text start="554.97" dur="5.339">utilize either their Treasury or</text>
  <text start="557.309" dur="6.15">personnel to implement those federal</text>
  <text start="560.309" dur="5.07">laws basically the states can do</text>
  <text start="563.459" dur="5.011">whatever they want they do not have to</text>
  <text start="565.379" dur="4.88">OE they do not need to follow every</text>
  <text start="568.47" dur="6.149">symbol law that the federal government</text>
  <text start="570.259" dur="7.09">passes they have their voice and again</text>
  <text start="574.619" dur="5.28">this goes with anything any law that is</text>
  <text start="577.349" dur="7.74">being pushed forward and on to the</text>
  <text start="579.899" dur="7.86">states now DARPA has designed a giant</text>
  <text start="585.089" dur="5.7">foldable satellite capable of</text>
  <text start="587.759" dur="5.37">surveilling forty percent of the earth</text>
  <text start="590.789" dur="4.46">the US Department of Defense has</text>
  <text start="593.129" dur="5.61">designed the next generation satellite</text>
  <text start="595.249" dur="5.92">capable of observing forty percent of</text>
  <text start="598.739" dur="6.45">the earth and they can do this all at</text>
  <text start="601.169" dur="6.86">one time and it does this in real time</text>
  <text start="605.189" dur="7.29">and it can do it anywhere on the planet</text>
  <text start="608.029" dur="7.72">which is quite amazing and they can spy</text>
  <text start="612.479" dur="6.18">and focus in and see what is going on</text>
  <text start="615.749" dur="8.66">and they can look at a lot going on at</text>
