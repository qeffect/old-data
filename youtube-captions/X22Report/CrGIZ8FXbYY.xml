  <text start="120.329" dur="5.79">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="122.429" dur="6.091">news now yesterday trunk came out and we</text>
  <text start="126.119" dur="3.931">reported that right on cue he said that</text>
  <text start="128.52" dur="4.86">the Fed would have to lower interest</text>
  <text start="130.05" dur="4.92">rates now we know that the Fed was not</text>
  <text start="133.38" dur="3.72">going to lower rates during this Fed</text>
  <text start="134.97" dur="2.849">meeting this is not how the game is</text>
  <text start="137.1" dur="2.49">played</text>
  <text start="137.819" dur="3.841">remember the mainstream media the deep</text>
  <text start="139.59" dur="4.95">state they&amp;#39;re all out there watching</text>
  <text start="141.66" dur="4.86">very closely to say hey look Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="144.54" dur="3.57">interfering with the Fed they&amp;#39;re no</text>
  <text start="146.52" dur="4.26">longer independent they have to be</text>
  <text start="148.11" dur="5.37">independent and this doesn&amp;#39;t mean the</text>
  <text start="150.78" dur="5.46">Fed is not going to cut rates it just</text>
  <text start="153.48" dur="5.399">means we&amp;#39;re watching a show we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="156.24" dur="4.8">watching it play out and this is just</text>
  <text start="158.879" dur="5.291">the beginning stages to get everyone</text>
  <text start="161.04" dur="4.93">used to the idea of what is coming</text>
  <text start="164.17" dur="4.86">and we know why this has to happen</text>
  <text start="165.97" dur="6.239">because Trump needs to keep the central</text>
  <text start="169.03" dur="6.26">bank system alive through the 2020</text>
  <text start="172.209" dur="5.791">elections this is the entire plan and</text>
  <text start="175.29" dur="4.3">while he&amp;#39;s doing this he&amp;#39;s setting up</text>
  <text start="178" dur="2.79">the Federal Reserve but if you look at</text>
  <text start="179.59" dur="4.17">the central bank economy it is</text>
  <text start="180.79" dur="6.06">completely imploding on itself and we</text>
  <text start="183.76" dur="5.64">see a lot of things starting to go the</text>
  <text start="186.85" dur="5.16">other way and this is why Trump is going</text>
  <text start="189.4" dur="4.14">to have the Fed cut rates if we look at</text>
  <text start="192.01" dur="3.39">the housing market once again and we</text>
  <text start="193.54" dur="3.96">look at the mortgage applications they</text>
  <text start="195.4" dur="3.57">continue to collapse overall mortgage</text>
  <text start="197.5" dur="4.38">applications they fell by four point</text>
  <text start="198.97" dur="6.84">three percent this week following last</text>
  <text start="201.88" dur="7.38">week&amp;#39;s of 7.3% think about why that was</text>
  <text start="205.81" dur="5.7">happening mortgage applications were</text>
  <text start="209.26" dur="5.67">falling because the Fed was raising</text>
  <text start="211.51" dur="4.68">rates then they decided to you know stop</text>
  <text start="214.93" dur="4.11">raising rates and they&amp;#39;re in a holding</text>
  <text start="216.19" dur="4.32">pattern that&amp;#39;s because Trump saw what</text>
  <text start="219.04" dur="3.09">the Fed was trying to do so what the</text>
  <text start="220.51" dur="4.74">deep state was going to do and they were</text>
  <text start="222.13" dur="5.73">going to implode the economy what the</text>
  <text start="225.25" dur="3.239">Fed was doing well it just didn&amp;#39;t stop</text>
  <text start="227.86" dur="3.18">on a dime</text>
  <text start="228.489" dur="5.161">everything continually implodes on</text>
  <text start="231.04" dur="7.229">itself and the only way to stop this is</text>
  <text start="233.65" dur="7.47">to cut rates to reintroduce stimulus and</text>
  <text start="238.269" dur="5.851">yesterday if you notice Trump pointed to</text>
  <text start="241.12" dur="5.85">China because they reintroduced stimulus</text>
  <text start="244.12" dur="5.459">why because the Fed couldn&amp;#39;t do it right</text>
  <text start="246.97" dur="4.68">at this time why because they were</text>
  <text start="249.579" dur="3.871">tightening their balance sheet but now</text>
  <text start="251.65" dur="4.47">the Fed is reported that they are</text>
  <text start="253.45" dur="6.48">looking at some type of new stimulus</text>
  <text start="256.12" dur="6.45">package and I would suspect that the</text>
  <text start="259.93" dur="5.94">rates will be cut maybe by the end of</text>
  <text start="262.57" dur="6.599">this summer leading into the 2020</text>
  <text start="265.87" dur="5.49">election which will allow the economy</text>
  <text start="269.169" dur="3.541">and I believe stimulus is going to be</text>
  <text start="271.36" dur="4.23">pushed out there and I believe the</text>
  <text start="272.71" dur="5.55">economy is going to roar into the 2020</text>
  <text start="275.59" dur="5.91">elections does this mean the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="278.26" dur="5.82">fixed no this means that the can is</text>
  <text start="281.5" dur="5.419">being kicked down the street for a very</text>
  <text start="284.08" dur="5.459">specific reason to destroy the Fed</text>
  <text start="286.919" dur="4.961">that&amp;#39;s the whole entire plan but if</text>
  <text start="289.539" dur="4.411">Trump is not in the White House how is</text>
  <text start="291.88" dur="2.909">he going to destroy the Fed it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="293.95" dur="3.28">going to work</text>
  <text start="294.789" dur="5.801">this is why he needs to use</text>
  <text start="297.23" dur="5.49">the economy as a weapon he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="300.59" dur="5.73">use this to win the elections think</text>
  <text start="302.72" dur="6.51">about it if he has the economy doing the</text>
  <text start="306.32" dur="6.23">best that it&amp;#39;s ever done the numbers</text>
  <text start="309.23" dur="6.56">look fantastic people feel good and</text>
  <text start="312.55" dur="5.5">everyone believes that the economy is</text>
  <text start="315.79" dur="4.5">incredible I mean he&amp;#39;s using the same</text>
  <text start="318.05" dur="4.89">weapons that they used on us all along</text>
  <text start="320.29" dur="4.42">what are the other candidates going to</text>
  <text start="322.94" dur="3.15">do are they going to say listen I can</text>
  <text start="324.71" dur="3.45">make it even better than that no they</text>
  <text start="326.09" dur="3.96">can&amp;#39;t make that argument they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="328.16" dur="4.44">really touch the economy so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="330.05" dur="4.83">gonna go to different issues and guess</text>
  <text start="332.6" dur="6.3">what that&amp;#39;s where things start to fall</text>
  <text start="334.88" dur="7.05">apart and if you notice Trump is pushing</text>
  <text start="338.9" dur="5.49">peace in many areas because he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="341.93" dur="4.92">have that under his belt also and he</text>
  <text start="344.39" dur="4.02">needs to do this because when we look at</text>
  <text start="346.85" dur="3.69">the central banking system it is</text>
  <text start="348.41" dur="4.56">completely imploding on itself now</text>
  <text start="350.54" dur="5.37">according to the Treasury&amp;#39;s conservative</text>
  <text start="352.97" dur="5.13">budget estimates interest on the US</text>
  <text start="355.91" dur="6.03">public debt is on track to reach a</text>
  <text start="358.1" dur="7.23">record 591 billion this fiscal year more</text>
  <text start="361.94" dur="5.28">than the entire budget deficit in 2014</text>
  <text start="365.33" dur="3.66">or 2015</text>
  <text start="367.22" dur="4.62">and it equates to almost 3 percent of</text>
  <text start="368.99" dur="7.17">estimated GDP the highest percentage</text>
  <text start="371.84" dur="6">since 2011 now as part of the Treasury&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="376.16" dur="3.54">presentation to the Treasury barring</text>
  <text start="377.84" dur="3.6">advisory committee there&amp;#39;s a chart</text>
  <text start="379.7" dur="3.84">showing the office of debt management</text>
  <text start="381.44" dur="4.5">forecasts for annual u.s. debt issuance</text>
  <text start="383.54" dur="5.01">broken down between its three components</text>
  <text start="385.94" dur="5.4">uses of funds primary deficit and</text>
  <text start="388.55" dur="6.05">interest expense and other the chart is</text>
  <text start="391.34" dur="6.84">troubling because while in 2019 and 2020</text>
  <text start="394.6" dur="5.65">US interest expense was surging it is</text>
  <text start="398.18" dur="4.41">roughly matched by the other deficit</text>
  <text start="400.25" dur="5.43">components in the US budget these</text>
  <text start="402.59" dur="6.39">gradually taper off by 2024 and in fact</text>
  <text start="405.68" dur="5.88">in 2025 become a source of budget</text>
  <text start="408.98" dur="3.75">surplus now that&amp;#39;s kind of questionable</text>
  <text start="411.56" dur="3.78">and I wouldn&amp;#39;t hold your breath on that</text>
  <text start="412.73" dur="6.27">one but there is a red flag and it</text>
  <text start="415.34" dur="6">starts in 2024 when the primary deficit</text>
  <text start="419" dur="5.34">drops to zero according to the latest</text>
  <text start="421.34" dur="5.1">projections all US debt issuance will be</text>
  <text start="424.34" dur="4.26">used to fund the u.s. net interest</text>
  <text start="426.44" dur="3.63">expense which depending on the</text>
  <text start="428.6" dur="2.31">prevailing interest rate between now and</text>
  <text start="430.07" dur="4.26">then will</text>
  <text start="430.91" dur="5.73">be anywhere between 700 billion and 1.2</text>
  <text start="434.33" dur="5.73">trillion or more in short we have</text>
  <text start="436.64" dur="5.19">entered the Ponzi finance phase the one</text>
  <text start="440.06" dur="4.32">in which all the new debt issuance is</text>
  <text start="441.83" dur="6.27">used to fund only interest on the debt</text>
  <text start="444.38" dur="6.33">and this happens around 2024 so what do</text>
  <text start="448.1" dur="6.21">you think Trump has to do before that</text>
  <text start="450.71" dur="6.96">time he needs to restructure and get rid</text>
  <text start="454.31" dur="6.45">of what the debt that is going to be the</text>
  <text start="457.67" dur="6.33">biggest problem and the only way to do</text>
  <text start="460.76" dur="5.16">this is to bring down the Fed and to</text>
  <text start="464" dur="4.08">restructure it and to take it over and</text>
  <text start="465.92" dur="4.32">to show that everything that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="468.08" dur="4.11">been doing was not on the up-and-up and</text>
  <text start="470.24" dur="3.93">this can be done through an audit</text>
  <text start="472.19" dur="3.93">because once you show this and they</text>
  <text start="474.17" dur="4.47">weren&amp;#39;t following their mandate they</text>
  <text start="476.12" dur="5.25">weren&amp;#39;t doing all of this for the people</text>
  <text start="478.64" dur="8.7">and if you can show all of this guess</text>
  <text start="481.37" dur="9.21">what this debt bye-bye now during this</text>
  <text start="487.34" dur="5.04">period of time Trump needs to bring back</text>
  <text start="490.58" dur="4.65">manufacturing now we see this happening</text>
  <text start="492.38" dur="5.34">we also see him deregulating there&amp;#39;s tax</text>
  <text start="495.23" dur="4.29">cuts there&amp;#39;s benefits to the people he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="497.72" dur="3.3">getting rid of the globalist trade deals</text>
  <text start="499.52" dur="3.27">he&amp;#39;s doing everything he possibly can</text>
  <text start="501.02" dur="3.77">and remember he&amp;#39;s only no office two and</text>
  <text start="502.79" dur="5.67">a half years and he&amp;#39;s done quite a bit</text>
  <text start="504.79" dur="6.07">some of this stuff is so tied up in</text>
  <text start="508.46" dur="5.009">Congress that he can&amp;#39;t even touch it I</text>
  <text start="510.86" dur="5.309">mean look at Obamacare for instance it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="513.469" dur="4.561">very difficult to get around this so you</text>
  <text start="516.169" dur="3.18">have to chip away at it a little bit at</text>
  <text start="518.03" dur="3.15">a time you have to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="519.349" dur="3.721">penalty which will then lead to say hey</text>
  <text start="521.18" dur="3.9">this is unconstitutional which will then</text>
  <text start="523.07" dur="4.05">lead to hey we don&amp;#39;t need Obamacare</text>
  <text start="525.08" dur="3.93">right now see how they&amp;#39;re doing all this</text>
  <text start="527.12" dur="2.97">they have to chip away at all these</text>
  <text start="529.01" dur="2.64">different things because these things</text>
  <text start="530.09" dur="3.84">that they put into place they made it</text>
  <text start="531.65" dur="3.93">impossible to get rid of in one fell</text>
  <text start="533.93" dur="5.88">swoop and especially if you have</text>
  <text start="535.58" dur="6.63">Congress that is not on board with Trump</text>
  <text start="539.81" dur="4.05">and they&amp;#39;re still working for the</text>
  <text start="542.21" dur="3.54">central bank the deep state the</text>
  <text start="543.86" dur="4.8">insurance companies they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="545.75" dur="6.03">do that much but we do see Trump</text>
  <text start="548.66" dur="5.21">bringing back manufacturing and the</text>
  <text start="551.78" dur="5.67">first three months of this year</text>
  <text start="553.87" dur="6.88">manufacturing saw wages for workers rise</text>
  <text start="557.45" dur="5.25">at the most in over a decade the</text>
  <text start="560.75" dur="3.899">employment Cost Index a measure of wages</text>
  <text start="562.7" dur="5.249">and benefits paid by businesses from</text>
  <text start="564.649" dur="4.5">manufacturing workers rose by 1% in the</text>
  <text start="567.949" dur="4.26">first quarter</text>
  <text start="569.149" dur="5.641">now the last time manufacturing saw a</text>
  <text start="572.209" dur="5.79">quarterly wage game that high was in</text>
  <text start="574.79" dur="5.779">2008 when wages also rose around 1% in</text>
  <text start="577.999" dur="5.551">the January through March period</text>
  <text start="580.569" dur="5.68">compared with a year ago manufacturing</text>
  <text start="583.55" dur="4.769">wages were up 2.9 percent in March</text>
  <text start="586.249" dur="5.731">that&amp;#39;s the biggest 12-month gain since</text>
  <text start="588.319" dur="7.38">March of 2003 when wages rose around 3.2</text>
  <text start="591.98" dur="6.359">percent now during Obama&amp;#39;s final year in</text>
  <text start="595.699" dur="6">office manufacturing wages they were</text>
  <text start="598.339" dur="6.54">rising on average around point 6 to 5</text>
  <text start="601.699" dur="6.63">a quarter so Trump has completely pulled</text>
  <text start="604.879" dur="6.96">away from that and wages are starting to</text>
  <text start="608.329" dur="7.141">move up now Trump he&amp;#39;s been doing</text>
  <text start="611.839" dur="5.55">everything he possibly can to pump this</text>
  <text start="615.47" dur="4.289">economy up to take control of the</text>
  <text start="617.389" dur="3.87">narrative to make sure the central bank</text>
  <text start="619.759" dur="5.67">the mainstream media the deep state</text>
  <text start="621.259" dur="7.26">can&amp;#39;t hit on the economy and it looks</text>

  <text start="628.519" dur="3.841">narrative with the mainstream media and</text>
  <text start="630.29" dur="4.169">now it looks like he&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="632.36" dur="4.969">controlled the narrative with the</text>
  <text start="634.459" dur="6.18">American people Gallup did a poll and</text>
  <text start="637.329" dur="5.92">Trump tweeted out the following 56% of</text>
  <text start="640.639" dur="5.31">Americans rate their financial situation</text>
  <text start="643.249" dur="6.051">as excellent or good this is the highest</text>
  <text start="645.949" dur="7.411">number since 2002 and up 10 points since</text>
  <text start="649.3" dur="6.43">2016 so what he&amp;#39;s done here is he he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="653.36" dur="4.169">pushed the narrative the mainstream</text>
  <text start="655.73" dur="3.719">media can&amp;#39;t touch it the American people</text>
  <text start="657.529" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re saying we really like the</text>
  <text start="659.449" dur="6.211">direction this economy is going in we</text>
  <text start="661.429" dur="7.02">like more of it and nobody can touch</text>
  <text start="665.66" dur="5.639">this he has the central bank the deep</text>
  <text start="668.449" dur="6.3">state exactly where he wants them</text>
  <text start="671.299" dur="7.111">economically which means they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="674.749" dur="5.64">touch him with regards to the economy</text>
  <text start="678.41" dur="3.75">they can&amp;#39;t even say that we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="680.389" dur="3.901">make it better it wouldn&amp;#39;t even make</text>
  <text start="682.16" dur="5.159">sense and they can&amp;#39;t say he&amp;#39;s doing a</text>
  <text start="684.29" dur="5.88">terrible job it&amp;#39;s going to be very very</text>
  <text start="687.319" dur="7.32">difficult to use economic questions on</text>
  <text start="690.17" dur="7.349">Trump now we know that Trump has been</text>
  <text start="694.639" dur="3.961">pushing the Fed to lower interest rates</text>
  <text start="697.519" dur="3.151">quit low was out there</text>
  <text start="698.6" dur="3.66">saying yes the Fed should lower interest</text>
  <text start="700.67" dur="2.67">rates and of course he said listen am i</text>
  <text start="702.26" dur="3.51">telling them what to do they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="703.34" dur="4.08">completely independent now this is part</text>
  <text start="705.77" dur="3.57">of the show the Fed had their there</text>
  <text start="707.42" dur="3.12">meeting and the Fed decided you know</text>
  <text start="709.34" dur="2.97">what we&amp;#39;re gonna stay in this holding</text>
  <text start="710.54" dur="3.45">pattern well of course they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="712.31" dur="3.9">stay in this holding pattern it would</text>
  <text start="713.99" dur="4.29">look it would look kind of suspicious if</text>
  <text start="716.21" dur="3.93">all of a sudden Trump tweeted out we</text>
  <text start="718.28" dur="4.23">want the Fed to lower rates and all of a</text>
  <text start="720.14" dur="4.14">sudden the Fed did it but a day or two</text>
  <text start="722.51" dur="4.56">later I mean that&amp;#39;s just completely</text>
  <text start="724.28" dur="4.38">suspicious so what they need to do is</text>
  <text start="727.07" dur="3.66">they need to keep this in a holding</text>
  <text start="728.66" dur="5.04">pattern Trump will tweet out a couple</text>
  <text start="730.73" dur="4.59">more times saying listen we really need</text>
  <text start="733.7" dur="3.42">the interest rate to come down the</text>
  <text start="735.32" dur="3.96">economy would be so much better off you</text>
  <text start="737.12" dur="3.78">like the economy now just think if the</text>
  <text start="739.28" dur="2.97">Fed just lower the interest rates a</text>
  <text start="740.9" dur="2.52">little bit more what do you think the</text>
  <text start="742.25" dur="2.37">stock market would do what do you think</text>
  <text start="743.42" dur="3.35">would happen with wages what do you</text>
  <text start="744.62" dur="6.9">think would happen with everything else</text>
  <text start="746.77" dur="8.89">he&amp;#39;s going to play this up over and over</text>
  <text start="751.52" dur="7.53">and we will watch how the Fed decides</text>
  <text start="755.66" dur="5.46">okay inflation is low enough and this is</text>
  <text start="759.05" dur="3.36">the way it&amp;#39;s supposed to be and this</text>
  <text start="761.12" dur="2.94">looks good and of course they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="762.41" dur="4.62">be making all this up and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="764.06" dur="7.95">lower the rates and once they lower the</text>
  <text start="767.03" dur="7.26">rates the economy is going to skyrocket</text>
  <text start="772.01" dur="3.3">the stock market everything that we know</text>
  <text start="774.29" dur="5.16">of is going to skyrocket</text>
  <text start="775.31" dur="5.97">and once the Fed decides to bring back</text>
  <text start="779.45" dur="3.18">stimulus because Trump with his tweets</text>
  <text start="781.28" dur="3.9">is also going to mention a lot of</text>
  <text start="782.63" dur="5.28">stimulus the economy is going to be</text>
  <text start="785.18" dur="7.11">soaring like we&amp;#39;ve never seen before</text>
  <text start="787.91" dur="5.49">come the 2020 elections and this is all</text>
  <text start="792.29" dur="4.41">part of the plan</text>
  <text start="793.4" dur="7.5">now he has the Fed exactly where he</text>
  <text start="796.7" dur="6.93">wants them because if they do anything</text>
  <text start="800.9" dur="8.82">else then what he&amp;#39;s telling them to do</text>
  <text start="803.63" dur="7.47">and the economy falls apart well all he</text>
  <text start="809.72" dur="3.66">has to do is point the finger think</text>
  <text start="811.1" dur="5.28">about what he&amp;#39;s just done he wanted the</text>
  <text start="813.38" dur="5.58">Fed to stop raising rates the Fed did it</text>
  <text start="816.38" dur="5.34">the economy got better he wanted the Fed</text>
  <text start="818.96" dur="4.74">to lower rates the feds going to listen</text>
  <text start="821.72" dur="4.5">and the economy&amp;#39;s going to get a lot</text>
  <text start="823.7" dur="4.98">better the stock market&amp;#39;s gonna go up so</text>
  <text start="826.22" dur="3.46">now people are thinking whoa Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="828.68" dur="3.04">right</text>
  <text start="829.68" dur="5.879">the Fed needs to follow what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="831.72" dur="6.059">now the Fed after the elections they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="835.559" dur="5.34">gonna go their own way and this is gonna</text>
  <text start="837.779" dur="6.06">be done on purpose this is part of the</text>
  <text start="840.899" dur="5.25">plan and people are going to see that</text>
  <text start="843.839" dur="4.53">look the Fed just decided to raise rates</text>
  <text start="846.149" dur="2.79">again and the economy starting to slip</text>
  <text start="848.369" dur="2.94">ooh</text>
  <text start="848.939" dur="4.171">they did the opposite of what Trump told</text>
  <text start="851.309" dur="2.19">them to do and the economy doesn&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="853.11" dur="2.19">good</text>
  <text start="853.499" dur="4.051">Trump&amp;#39;s gonna make a couple more tweets</text>
  <text start="855.3" dur="3.839">listen why did you do that the economy</text>
  <text start="857.55" dur="3.599">was soaring look how I had the economy</text>
  <text start="859.139" dur="4.021">was fantastic why are you messing with</text>
  <text start="861.149" dur="4.141">it then the Fed is going to raise rates</text>
  <text start="863.16" dur="6.149">once again they might even taper</text>
  <text start="865.29" dur="6.859">stimulus and all of a sudden the economy</text>
  <text start="869.309" dur="6.03">is going to start to implode on itself</text>
  <text start="872.149" dur="5.73">Trump is going to continually point the</text>
  <text start="875.339" dur="5.16">finger this is all part of the plan</text>
  <text start="877.879" dur="5.8">everything is going according to</text>
  <text start="880.499" dur="6.87">schedule sit back and enjoy the show</text>
  <text start="883.679" dur="4.981">but one thing we need to be ready for we</text>
  <text start="887.369" dur="3.39">are going to be trans finished</text>
  <text start="888.66" dur="4.2">transitioning from a central bank</text>
  <text start="890.759" dur="3.481">economy into a people&amp;#39;s economy and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="892.86" dur="2.849">gonna be a bumpy ride it&amp;#39;s just not</text>
  <text start="894.24" dur="3.509">gonna be like throw a switch and</text>
  <text start="895.709" dur="3.511">everything is great because a lot of</text>
  <text start="897.749" dur="3.33">people have been dealing with the</text>
  <text start="899.22" dur="4.32">Federal Reserve Note almost everybody</text>
  <text start="901.079" dur="3.151">and this is going to lose value very</text>
  <text start="903.54" dur="3.06">very quickly</text>
  <text start="904.23" dur="5.07">Gold is going to gain value very very</text>
  <text start="906.6" dur="4.739">quickly and those people who are not</text>
  <text start="909.3" dur="4.5">prepared they&amp;#39;re gonna be a little</text>
  <text start="911.339" dur="4.41">shocked of what is going on and of</text>
  <text start="913.8" dur="3.959">course it is going to help once the</text>
  <text start="915.749" dur="4.741">audit starts with the Fed but during</text>
  <text start="917.759" dur="5.55">this period of time there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="920.49" dur="4.829">a transition period because during that</text>
  <text start="923.309" dur="4.08">time where there&amp;#39;s an audit and things</text>
  <text start="925.319" dur="4.13">are going on that dollar is going to</text>
  <text start="927.389" dur="4.531">lose value think about it for a sec if</text>
  <text start="929.449" dur="5.08">Congress decides to audit the Fed the</text>
  <text start="931.92" dur="4.259">faith in the Federal Reserve Note where</text>
  <text start="934.529" dur="4.53">does that go well it goes down the tubes</text>
  <text start="936.179" dur="5.46">and once they start finding things it</text>
  <text start="939.059" dur="4.77">gets worse and worse and worse and this</text>
  <text start="941.639" dur="5.01">is the transition period because</text>
  <text start="943.829" dur="4.711">everyone&amp;#39;s Federal Reserve debt notes</text>
  <text start="946.649" dur="3.54">that they&amp;#39;re holding in the banks while</text>
  <text start="948.54" dur="3.839">those are electronic but under your</text>
  <text start="950.189" dur="4.671">mattress wherever it is those are going</text>
  <text start="952.379" dur="5.101">to be losing value every single day and</text>
  <text start="954.86" dur="4.719">yes the Patriots do have some type of</text>
  <text start="957.48" dur="3.99">plan but there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="959.579" dur="3.571">transition think about it when we came</text>
  <text start="961.47" dur="3.81">off the gold standard back in the</text>
  <text start="963.15" dur="4.5">70s and we&amp;#39;re moving on to a petrol</text>
  <text start="965.28" dur="4.62">dollar system we had very little bit of</text>
  <text start="967.65" dur="5.04">debt we were coming off a solid system</text>
  <text start="969.9" dur="5.91">moving on to a crappy system which was</text>
  <text start="972.69" dur="5.37">based on oil and pretty much nothing</text>
  <text start="975.81" dur="3.93">else and the federal reserve was allowed</text>
  <text start="978.06" dur="3.33">to create as much currency as possible</text>
  <text start="979.74" dur="3.72">look what happened there are many</text>
  <text start="981.39" dur="4.65">countries that it was a nightmare for</text>
  <text start="983.46" dur="5.61">them the United States we couldn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="986.04" dur="5.55">fuel people had no jobs things were a</text>
  <text start="989.07" dur="6">complete and utter mess yes interest</text>
  <text start="991.59" dur="6.27">rates were very high and inflation was</text>
  <text start="995.07" dur="5.19">hitting that was the only good thing in</text>
  <text start="997.86" dur="4.44">the beginning of their system and people</text>
  <text start="1000.26" dur="4.58">thought oh well look I have these great</text>
  <text start="1002.3" dur="4.98">CDs look my house just went up in value</text>
  <text start="1004.84" dur="3.94">yes it&amp;#39;s always great in the beginning</text>
  <text start="1007.28" dur="3.15">of the system but look at the gas lines</text>
  <text start="1008.78" dur="4.5">look what was happening people couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1010.43" dur="5.01">find jobs everything took a little while</text>
  <text start="1013.28" dur="5.04">before it all evened out and that was in</text>
  <text start="1015.44" dur="4.47">the 80s when all of a sudden credit was</text>
  <text start="1018.32" dur="3.36">released and the interest rate started</text>
  <text start="1019.91" dur="4.17">to come down people started to get more</text>
  <text start="1021.68" dur="4.62">and more credit cards because the value</text>
  <text start="1024.08" dur="4.32">of the dollar decreased and people</text>
  <text start="1026.3" dur="4.77">couldn&amp;#39;t live on that and they had a</text>
  <text start="1028.4" dur="5.1">supplement it&amp;#39;s somehow someway and as</text>
  <text start="1031.07" dur="4.23">we went through the 90s into the 2000s</text>
  <text start="1033.5" dur="4.5">it got worse and worse and worse</text>
  <text start="1035.3" dur="5.55">think about this time around we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1038" dur="5.13">coming off a system where the value of</text>
  <text start="1040.85" dur="6.66">the dollar well that has decreased about</text>
  <text start="1043.13" dur="7.5">what 97% 98% right now and gold has been</text>
