  <text start="47.41" dur="5.1">hi and welcome you listening to the x 22</text>
  <text start="51.04" dur="4.76">report my name is dave and this is</text>
  <text start="52.51" dur="6.63">episode 1159 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="55.8" dur="5.77">december 22nd 2016 and the total the</text>
  <text start="59.14" dur="4.89">episode is is the US government pushing</text>
  <text start="61.57" dur="5.4">fake economic data to keep everyone in</text>
  <text start="64.03" dur="5.94">the dark let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="66.97" dur="4.71">collapse financial news now in the last</text>
  <text start="69.97" dur="3.6">couple of days we&amp;#39;ve been noticing the</text>
  <text start="71.68" dur="6.93">stock market has been bobbing up and</text>
  <text start="73.57" dur="6.99">down just shy of 20,000 points seems</text>
  <text start="78.61" dur="4.89">very interesting to me that they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="80.56" dur="6.41">pushed it over the edge yet but what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="83.5" dur="7.28">looking at right now is that most likely</text>
  <text start="86.97" dur="9.37">they might wait until the Friday before</text>
  <text start="90.78" dur="10.15">New Year&amp;#39;s because saturday is New</text>
  <text start="96.34" dur="6.18">Year&amp;#39;s Eve Friday most likely to give</text>
  <text start="100.93" dur="4.56">everyone this great feeling that</text>
  <text start="102.52" dur="6.81">everything is incredible they might push</text>
  <text start="105.49" dur="7.469">it up at that point and it looks like</text>
  <text start="109.33" dur="6.899">they&amp;#39;re keeping it steady making it just</text>
  <text start="112.959" dur="6.991">shy of 20,000 and they&amp;#39;re just waiting</text>
  <text start="116.229" dur="6.39">for that moment we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and</text>
  <text start="119.95" dur="3.779">see but to me this is what it looks like</text>
  <text start="122.619" dur="3.36">doesn&amp;#39;t mean I&amp;#39;m going to be right but</text>
  <text start="123.729" dur="6.87">we can see right now they definitely</text>
  <text start="125.979" dur="8.431">want this to go over 20,000 and the</text>
  <text start="130.599" dur="8.211">elite right now the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="134.41" dur="7.409">are pushing out economic data that</text>
  <text start="138.81" dur="5.28">absolutely makes no sense whatsoever i</text>
  <text start="141.819" dur="7.441">mean when we&amp;#39;re looking at the hard data</text>
  <text start="144.09" dur="7.149">it&amp;#39;s completely fake and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="149.26" dur="4.32">putting out there it doesn&amp;#39;t even match</text>
  <text start="151.239" dur="5.341">up anymore I mean think about this for a</text>
  <text start="153.58" dur="7.35">second initial jobless claims before the</text>
  <text start="156.58" dur="7.92">election all of a sudden they just drop</text>
  <text start="160.93" dur="6.54">they declined dramatically and then</text>
  <text start="164.5" dur="6.45">right after the elections they pop right</text>
  <text start="167.47" dur="6.629">back up where they were prior to the</text>
  <text start="170.95" dur="7.17">elections very odd why would that happen</text>
  <text start="174.099" dur="6.091">all of a sudden well they manipulated it</text>
  <text start="178.12" dur="3.15">for the elections now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="180.19" dur="4.02">interesting about the</text>
  <text start="181.27" dur="6.59">is that initial jobless claims going</text>
  <text start="184.21" dur="7.35">back all the way to the 70s every time</text>
  <text start="187.86" dur="6.82">initial jobless claims hits a low and</text>
  <text start="191.56" dur="7.8">that low is around 300,000 jobs or so</text>
  <text start="194.68" dur="7.2">and once the trend goes below that all</text>
  <text start="199.36" dur="4.47">of a sudden we&amp;#39;re in a recession now it</text>
  <text start="201.88" dur="5.37">didn&amp;#39;t happen like that all throughout</text>
  <text start="203.83" dur="5.43">going back to nineteen seventy sometimes</text>
  <text start="207.25" dur="5.82">it was a little bit above that line but</text>
  <text start="209.26" dur="6.27">the bigger recessions well they dropped</text>
  <text start="213.07" dur="5.19">below 300 thousand and then boom we were</text>
  <text start="215.53" dur="5.4">in this recession if we go back to two</text>
  <text start="218.26" dur="6.38">thousand eight or so it came down just</text>
  <text start="220.93" dur="7.71">below 300 thousand and then boom</text>
  <text start="224.64" dur="5.65">everyone lost their jobs I&amp;#39;d say the</text>
  <text start="228.64" dur="4.11">majority of the people lost their jobs</text>
  <text start="230.29" dur="5.3">not everyone but we know that there was</text>
  <text start="232.75" dur="6.93">a lot of people out of work this time</text>
  <text start="235.59" dur="9.4">we&amp;#39;re hovering around 275,000 way below</text>
  <text start="239.68" dur="7.8">the 300,000 line and we can see by</text>
  <text start="244.99" dur="5.52">looking at this that they have</text>
  <text start="247.48" dur="5.45">manipulated this very very far where it</text>
  <text start="250.51" dur="5.07">looks like we&amp;#39;re not even going to be</text>
  <text start="252.93" dur="5.02">recession at this point we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="255.58" dur="4.95">be in a collapsing area we&amp;#39;re already in</text>
  <text start="257.95" dur="3.81">the recession because we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="260.53" dur="5.7">starting to see the initial jobless</text>
  <text start="261.76" dur="6.84">claims start to rise once again now very</text>
  <text start="266.23" dur="4.47">interestingly they&amp;#39;re telling us that</text>
  <text start="268.6" dur="4.62">everyone has a job everyone&amp;#39;s making</text>
  <text start="270.7" dur="5.37">good money unemployment down by four to</text>
  <text start="273.22" dur="4.38">four point six percent and we&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="276.07" dur="3.72">holiday season but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="277.6" dur="6.569">interesting is personal spending month a</text>
  <text start="279.79" dur="8.01">month is declining we see that personal</text>
  <text start="284.169" dur="8.131">income is also declining at the same</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="6.45">time combine these two and the savings</text>
  <text start="292.3" dur="6.27">rate in November plunged to its lowest</text>
  <text start="294.25" dur="6.75">since march of 2015 and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="298.57" dur="4.98">seeing right now is disposable real</text>
  <text start="301" dur="8.669">personal income per capita dropped from</text>
  <text start="303.55" dur="9.15">30 9292 to 39,000 247 and this is the</text>
  <text start="309.669" dur="4.721">weakest growth that we&amp;#39;ve seen since</text>
  <text start="312.7" dur="6.07">2014</text>
  <text start="314.39" dur="8.48">and it shows us that our people really</text>
  <text start="318.77" dur="7.59">getting good paying jobs and from this</text>
  <text start="322.87" dur="9.79">not really because income is continually</text>
  <text start="326.36" dur="9.87">declining savings are declining spending</text>
  <text start="332.66" dur="6.93">is declining so something really doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="336.23" dur="4.83">make sense now yesterday the corporate</text>
  <text start="339.59" dur="5.25">media was all over the place with</text>
  <text start="341.06" dur="6.69">existing home sales they&amp;#39;ve surged the</text>
  <text start="344.84" dur="4.02">best we&amp;#39;ve ever seen well something</text>
  <text start="347.75" dur="2.22">really doesn&amp;#39;t make sense and I</text>
  <text start="348.86" dur="4.65">discussed this a little bit yesterday</text>
  <text start="349.97" dur="5.63">and when we look further into the hard</text>
  <text start="353.51" dur="4.41">data we see something very interesting</text>
  <text start="355.6" dur="4.48">now the national association of realtors</text>
  <text start="357.92" dur="5.07">they want us to believe that home sales</text>
  <text start="360.08" dur="5.64">occurred in November at 5.6 million</text>
  <text start="362.99" dur="5.25">annualized rate for the month up 15.4</text>
  <text start="365.72" dur="5.88">percent from November of 2015 and at</text>
  <text start="368.24" dur="6.78">point seven percent from October but</text>
  <text start="371.6" dur="6.57">they left out that the original report</text>
  <text start="375.02" dur="8.49">for October was revised lower pushing</text>
  <text start="378.17" dur="9.45">the data into November but okay let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="383.51" dur="8.04">put that aside here mortgage application</text>
  <text start="387.62" dur="7.44">data completely contradicts the national</text>
  <text start="391.55" dur="5.76">association of realtors the</text>
  <text start="395.06" dur="6.15">interpretation of the data that was</text>
  <text start="397.31" dur="6.6">collected does not match up what they</text>
  <text start="401.21" dur="6.51">are telling us if existing home sales</text>
  <text start="403.91" dur="5.19">are based on closings escrow clears</text>
  <text start="407.72" dur="3.45">which means the sales report for</text>
  <text start="409.1" dur="4.32">November is based on contracts signed</text>
  <text start="411.17" dur="6.24">primarily from October and summon</text>
  <text start="413.42" dur="7.5">late-september early November well</text>
  <text start="417.41" dur="6.06">during that time mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="420.92" dur="7.59">began dropping off a cliff in late</text>
  <text start="423.47" dur="9.03">August hmm something doesn&amp;#39;t jive right</text>
  <text start="428.51" dur="5.7">here looking at the data itself you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="432.5" dur="4.26">see that the national association of</text>
  <text start="434.21" dur="5.19">realtors data sampling shows that home</text>
  <text start="436.76" dur="4.92">sales dropped by six point seven percent</text>
  <text start="439.4" dur="4.92">from October yet it&amp;#39;s seasonal</text>
  <text start="441.68" dur="6.15">adjustments suggest that home sales</text>
  <text start="444.32" dur="5.4">increased from october to november this</text>
  <text start="447.83" dur="4.61">despite a massive plunge in mortgage</text>
  <text start="449.72" dur="5.16">applications during that period in which</text>
  <text start="452.44" dur="5.62">contracts would have been signed for</text>
  <text start="454.88" dur="6.81">November&amp;#39;s closings it doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="458.06" dur="6.39">sense what they&amp;#39;re telling us makes no</text>
  <text start="461.69" dur="6.72">sense and then Freddie Mac comes out and</text>
  <text start="464.45" dur="6.57">says home affordability drops to eight</text>
  <text start="468.41" dur="4.95">year lows where they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="471.02" dur="4.62">people can&amp;#39;t even afford home so people</text>
  <text start="473.36" dur="4.44">can&amp;#39;t afford homes the rate increased</text>
  <text start="475.64" dur="3.87">and mortgage applications declined and</text>
  <text start="477.8" dur="6.81">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us there was</text>
  <text start="479.51" dur="8.07">this huge surge in purchases it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="484.61" dur="7.68">make sense and they forgot to tell us</text>
  <text start="487.58" dur="8.45">that they revised the numbers so what</text>
  <text start="492.29" dur="8.73">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a complete lie</text>
  <text start="496.03" dur="7.36">to go along with their narrative of the</text>
  <text start="501.02" dur="4.85">story that the economy is improving</text>
  <text start="503.39" dur="4.86">think about it look what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="505.87" dur="3.49">they&amp;#39;ve manipulated the unemployment</text>
  <text start="508.25" dur="3.78">that brought it down to four point six</text>
  <text start="509.36" dur="4.89">percent spending is declining with all</text>
  <text start="512.03" dur="3.48">these people having jobs savings are</text>
  <text start="514.25" dur="5.03">declining with all these people having</text>
  <text start="515.51" dur="7.2">jobs retail sales we know our estimated</text>
  <text start="519.28" dur="8.07">we know they are absolutely awful Black</text>
  <text start="522.71" dur="9.51">Friday Cyber Monday a bust we know that</text>
  <text start="527.35" dur="10.03">individuals can&amp;#39;t afford the homes so</text>
  <text start="532.22" dur="9.51">something right now doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="537.38" dur="6.93">and we know that corporations</text>
  <text start="541.73" dur="5.04">caterpillar IBM all these different</text>
  <text start="544.31" dur="5.13">companies they&amp;#39;re not making sales</text>
  <text start="546.77" dur="5.94">profits are very low they&amp;#39;re laying off</text>
  <text start="549.44" dur="8.01">people but this stock market keeps</text>
  <text start="552.71" dur="9.72">moving up and up and up again something</text>
  <text start="557.45" dur="7.59">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense now according to a</text>
  <text start="562.43" dur="5.09">separate analysis released by RealtyTrac</text>
  <text start="565.04" dur="5.58">home affordability in the fourth quarter</text>
  <text start="567.52" dur="7.48">tumbled to the lowest since the</text>
  <text start="570.62" dur="7.08">financial crisis of 2008 twenty-nine</text>
  <text start="575" dur="6.27">percent of local markets are less</text>
  <text start="577.7" dur="6.87">affordable than historic norms</text>
  <text start="581.27" dur="6.03">well once again how are people</text>
  <text start="584.57" dur="4.62">purchasing these homes if mortgage</text>
  <text start="587.3" dur="3.93">applications are declining and interest</text>
  <text start="589.19" dur="5.07">rates are going up we already know from</text>
  <text start="591.23" dur="6.41">the other data that we received millions</text>
  <text start="594.26" dur="7.05">of people were pushed out of the market</text>
  <text start="597.64" dur="5.5">so this all doesn&amp;#39;t make sense we also</text>
  <text start="601.31" dur="3.99">getting reports that durable good orders</text>
  <text start="603.14" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;ve tumbled by four point six</text>
  <text start="605.3" dur="3.87">percent month on month this is the</text>
  <text start="607.1" dur="4.92">biggest drop since august of 2014 and</text>
  <text start="609.17" dur="8.13">this is the big ticket items washers</text>
  <text start="612.02" dur="8.67">dryers and if you remove defense orders</text>
  <text start="617.3" dur="8.04">well it completely crashed year-on-year</text>
  <text start="620.69" dur="8.61">by 0.5% and month on month by six point</text>
  <text start="625.34" dur="6.18">six percent so we have all of this data</text>
  <text start="629.3" dur="4.59">that they&amp;#39;re trying to throw at us they</text>
  <text start="631.52" dur="6.6">have the stock market trying to reach</text>
  <text start="633.89" dur="8.37">20,000 and they&amp;#39;re suppressing precious</text>
  <text start="638.12" dur="6.54">metals then they come out where they say</text>
  <text start="642.26" dur="3.96">you know that third-quarter gdp forget</text>
  <text start="644.66" dur="3.87">two-point-nine percent forget</text>
  <text start="646.22" dur="5.01">three-point-two percent it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="648.53" dur="5.24">three-point-five percent the economy is</text>
  <text start="651.23" dur="5.73">much much better than we ever thought</text>
  <text start="653.77" dur="7.75">and then we look at this and we say well</text>
  <text start="656.96" dur="7.71">how in the world did this happen it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="661.52" dur="8.13">completely impossible and when we look</text>
  <text start="664.67" dur="7.38">at these numbers we see well what did</text>
  <text start="669.65" dur="4.77">they include in this well this was the</text>
  <text start="672.05" dur="4.4">time period where they used soy beans</text>
  <text start="674.42" dur="5.79">and they exported it out of the country</text>
  <text start="676.45" dur="7.9">which pushed it up what&amp;#39;s included in</text>
  <text start="680.21" dur="7.56">this GDP number well the spending of</text>
  <text start="684.35" dur="6.48">people in the country and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="687.77" dur="7.04">included in that health care how high do</text>
  <text start="690.83" dur="9.51">the premiums go pretty darn high and</text>
  <text start="694.81" dur="9.19">then you have spending on utilities air</text>
  <text start="700.34" dur="8.7">conditioned bills inventories you put</text>
  <text start="704" dur="9.05">all of this together and you have almost</text>
  <text start="709.04" dur="4.01">two percent right there</text>
  <text start="713.09" dur="5.17">this whole thing is completely</text>
  <text start="714.99" dur="7.05">manipulated because all the other</text>
  <text start="718.26" dur="6.42">quarters they were at like one point</text>
  <text start="722.04" dur="8.64">eight percent point seven percent and</text>
  <text start="724.68" dur="9.75">remember Obama he never got that three</text>
  <text start="730.68" dur="5.94">percent gdp number and here we are at</text>
  <text start="734.43" dur="5.99">the end of the year he got three point</text>
  <text start="736.62" dur="6.57">five percent it&amp;#39;s a holiday miracle and</text>
  <text start="740.42" dur="8.68">then we look at the feds national</text>
  <text start="743.19" dur="10.26">activity index well this has tumbled to</text>
  <text start="749.1" dur="6.93">three-month lows it is down negative</text>
  <text start="753.45" dur="4.91">point 27 in November and when you</text>
  <text start="756.03" dur="7.11">compare this with the hope of the people</text>
  <text start="758.36" dur="7.96">hope is rising but the Fed national</text>
  <text start="763.14" dur="6.8">activity index is tumbling industrial</text>
  <text start="766.32" dur="6.87">production is tumbling durable goods</text>
  <text start="769.94" dur="6.07">declined when we look at the hard data</text>
  <text start="773.19" dur="4.17">of real estate it&amp;#39;s declining when we</text>
  <text start="776.01" dur="3.93">look at the retail numbers it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="777.36" dur="4.86">declining when we look at income levels</text>
  <text start="779.94" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re declining when we look at</text>
  <text start="782.22" dur="8.13">spending its declining when we look at</text>
  <text start="784.71" dur="9.69">savings it&amp;#39;s declining this data that</text>
  <text start="790.35" dur="7.71">we&amp;#39;re looking at is absolutely awful now</text>
  <text start="794.4" dur="6.8">out in Italy well Italy has now joined</text>
  <text start="798.06" dur="5.58">the ballon crowd monte dei paschi is</text>
