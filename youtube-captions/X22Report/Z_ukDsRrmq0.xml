  <text start="58.23" dur="4.22">episode</text>
  <text start="59.27" dur="5.59">1310 a and today&amp;#39;s date is June 19th</text>
  <text start="62.45" dur="5.17">2017 and the title of the episode is</text>
  <text start="64.86" dur="6.27">three indicators put the u.s. on track</text>
  <text start="67.62" dur="5.25">for an economic disaster let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="71.13" dur="5.7">the economic collapse financial news</text>
  <text start="72.87" dur="6.6">well it looks like the first day of the</text>
  <text start="76.83" dur="5.37">official brexit talks is over and</text>
  <text start="79.47" dur="5.19">according to statement appears that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="82.2" dur="5.46">been a useful session even though the</text>
  <text start="84.66" dur="4.83">real work has only just begun and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="87.66" dur="4.62">very interesting about all this is that</text>
  <text start="89.49" dur="5.879">we saw a couple events occurred during</text>
  <text start="92.28" dur="4.62">the brexit talks and we&amp;#39;ll be talking</text>
  <text start="95.369" dur="4.441">about this a little bit later in the</text>
  <text start="96.9" dur="5.4">next report but we can see right now</text>
  <text start="99.81" dur="6.12">that the central banking system the deep</text>
  <text start="102.3" dur="6.87">state they don&amp;#39;t want a brexit to happen</text>
  <text start="105.93" dur="5.91">there try if you notice a lot of these</text>
  <text start="109.17" dur="6.78">events are continually happening in the</text>
  <text start="111.84" dur="6.96">UK it&amp;#39;s very coincidental it&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="115.95" dur="4.38">during the brexit period and of course</text>
  <text start="118.8" dur="4.319">there&amp;#39;s other agendas associated with</text>
  <text start="120.33" dur="6.899">this but we can see how this is being</text>
  <text start="123.119" dur="5.61">used to distract to get people to say</text>
  <text start="127.229" dur="3.871">maybe we shouldn&amp;#39;t do this right now</text>
  <text start="128.729" dur="4.711">maybe we should stick together and we</text>
  <text start="131.1" dur="6.18">can see right now they realize that they</text>
  <text start="133.44" dur="8.19">can&amp;#39;t let any country remove themselves</text>
  <text start="137.28" dur="7.23">from their system every single country</text>
  <text start="141.63" dur="5.64">needs to be with them because in the end</text>
  <text start="144.51" dur="5.1">what they want to do is they want to</text>
  <text start="147.27" dur="4.049">restart this system bring us down</text>
  <text start="149.61" dur="4.92">another 40 years and if we give them</text>
  <text start="151.319" dur="5.811">another 40 years they will create that</text>
  <text start="154.53" dur="5.31">one-world government they will create a</text>
  <text start="157.13" dur="5.439">system with a one-world currency where</text>
  <text start="159.84" dur="4.95">they will control the people they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="162.569" dur="3.631">control the people monetarily they will</text>
  <text start="164.79" dur="3.99">control the people by getting rid of</text>
  <text start="166.2" dur="5.16">their rights and we can see this has</text>
  <text start="168.78" dur="4.89">been their agenda all along now here in</text>
  <text start="171.36" dur="4.47">the United States going back to the</text>
  <text start="173.67" dur="3.66">Obama administration we saw that the Fed</text>
  <text start="175.83" dur="3.69">they did everything in its power to</text>
  <text start="177.33" dur="4.439">surge all asset prices way I mean stocks</text>
  <text start="179.52" dur="5.04">bonds real estate collectibles you name</text>
  <text start="181.769" dur="5.101">it they were pushing the bubble bigger</text>
  <text start="184.56" dur="4.38">and bigger and bigger now under Trump</text>
  <text start="186.87" dur="3.089">it looks like they&amp;#39;re doing the exact</text>
  <text start="188.94" dur="4.219">opposite</text>
  <text start="189.959" dur="5.971">now as Bubble 2.0 was forming an</text>
  <text start="193.159" dur="4.571">unorthodox demand increased pushing</text>
  <text start="195.93" dur="4.949">houses prices beyond the reach of most</text>
  <text start="197.73" dur="5.789">end-users shelter buyers in any given</text>
  <text start="200.879" dur="5.25">region volume remained relatively weak</text>
  <text start="203.519" dur="5.821">sales volume has never been a feature of</text>
  <text start="206.129" dur="6.841">the housing bubble 2.0 in fact after</text>
  <text start="209.34" dur="5.88">seven years observe 10 trillion in new</text>
  <text start="212.97" dur="5.25">government debt and 5 trillion in fed</text>
  <text start="215.22" dur="5.31">money printing builder new home sales</text>
  <text start="218.22" dur="6">are sitting at around 60% of the volume</text>
  <text start="220.53" dur="5.61">of the past bubble resales are about 20%</text>
  <text start="224.22" dur="4.17">lower and we need to remember something</text>
  <text start="226.14" dur="5.189">very important resales rose more because</text>
  <text start="228.39" dur="6.36">that&amp;#39;s where the unorthodox demand lives</text>
  <text start="231.329" dur="6.24">the problem has always been about true</text>
  <text start="234.75" dur="6.239">fundamental demand which is a key</text>
  <text start="237.569" dur="7.831">feature missing from this fake housing</text>
  <text start="240.989" dur="9.36">recovery this housing bubble always need</text>
  <text start="245.4" dur="8.55">low mortgage rates and if this</text>
  <text start="250.349" dur="6.931">disappears guess what happens this fake</text>
  <text start="253.95" dur="5.42">housing bubble also disappears and this</text>
  <text start="257.28" dur="6.27">is what we see happening right now</text>
  <text start="259.37" dur="7.299">because as we know this housing bubble</text>
  <text start="263.55" dur="5.549">when it pops and as the mortgages rate</text>
  <text start="266.669" dur="5.911">continually increases it pushes people</text>
  <text start="269.099" dur="7.04">out of the market people can&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="272.58" dur="7.91">these homes people start lowering their</text>
  <text start="276.139" dur="7.96">housing prices and people start to lose</text>
  <text start="280.49" dur="5.5">their equity in the homes when people</text>
  <text start="284.099" dur="4.29">start to do this people say to</text>
  <text start="285.99" dur="4.35">themselves wait a minute is the economy</text>
  <text start="288.389" dur="4.141">doing as well as I thought because</text>
  <text start="290.34" dur="5.009">remember when housing prices are going</text>
  <text start="292.53" dur="5.52">up for some reason people in their minds</text>
  <text start="295.349" dur="5.341">they think the economy is doing very</text>
  <text start="298.05" dur="4.679">well they feel very comfortable I just</text>
  <text start="300.69" dur="4.349">on paper I just made another fifty</text>
  <text start="302.729" dur="4.741">thousand dollars in my house even though</text>
  <text start="305.039" dur="4.651">it&amp;#39;s on paper only and when it starts</text>
  <text start="307.47" dur="4.65">coming down people get nervous people</text>
  <text start="309.69" dur="4.349">get afraid and of course when the</text>
  <text start="312.12" dur="3.66">housing prices are going up people take</text>
  <text start="314.039" dur="4.261">out equity loans to pay for their credit</text>
  <text start="315.78" dur="4.8">cards to add on to their homes or buy a</text>
  <text start="318.3" dur="4.32">new car and things like that and</text>
  <text start="320.58" dur="4.579">we could see that this is going to end</text>
  <text start="322.62" dur="6.75">in its early started so the Fed is doing</text>
  <text start="325.159" dur="6.76">everything completely opposite of what</text>
  <text start="329.37" dur="4.65">they did during the last eight years</text>
  <text start="331.919" dur="5.671">with Obama because what is happening</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="5.16">right now we&amp;#39;re on the back end where</text>
  <text start="337.59" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re saying okay we brought it up to</text>
  <text start="339.18" dur="4.259">a certain level now we&amp;#39;re bringing it</text>
  <text start="341.55" dur="3.51">down this is why we&amp;#39;re raising interest</text>
  <text start="343.439" dur="3.091">rates we don&amp;#39;t care what the economy is</text>
  <text start="345.06" dur="4.05">doing we know all the numbers are</text>
  <text start="346.53" dur="4.169">completely fake because we&amp;#39;re the Fed we</text>
  <text start="349.11" dur="3.119">know what we&amp;#39;ve been doing we know we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="350.699" dur="3.78">been pumping up the stock market we know</text>
  <text start="352.229" dur="5.041">we pumped up the housing market we know</text>
  <text start="354.479" dur="7.261">retails failing because we&amp;#39;ve never let</text>
  <text start="357.27" dur="6.69">the currency hit the market we know that</text>
  <text start="361.74" dur="3.63">individuals are not getting jobs we know</text>
  <text start="363.96" dur="4.049">it&amp;#39;s all fake so it really doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="365.37" dur="4.949">matter and right now this is what is</text>
  <text start="368.009" dur="5.52">happening so are the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="370.319" dur="9.5">getting ready to crash the system and if</text>
  <text start="373.529" dur="10.26">you look yes they are think about it the</text>
  <text start="379.819" dur="5.831">GDP continually declines I mean we</text>
  <text start="383.789" dur="3.12">started at it three or four point Oh</text>
  <text start="385.65" dur="3.329">whatever it was it doesn&amp;#39;t really make</text>
  <text start="386.909" dur="5.611">any difference because it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="388.979" dur="6.3">fake the New York Fed well they&amp;#39;re down</text>
  <text start="392.52" dur="4.759">to one point nine and we can see the</text>
  <text start="395.279" dur="4.95">Atlanta Fed is continually dropping and</text>
  <text start="397.279" dur="4.241">if you look at the trend it is</text>
  <text start="400.229" dur="4.65">continually declining</text>
  <text start="401.52" dur="6.48">over and over and over it&amp;#39;s not trending</text>
  <text start="404.879" dur="5.88">up it&amp;#39;s always trending down now if you</text>
  <text start="408" dur="5.52">look at the city&amp;#39;s surprise index it has</text>
  <text start="410.759" dur="6.69">collapsed two levels not seen since 2011</text>
  <text start="413.52" dur="6.929">this is the second indicator and we know</text>
  <text start="417.449" dur="4.71">that the tax revenue coming in to the</text>
  <text start="420.449" dur="4.201">federal government the tax revenue</text>
  <text start="422.159" dur="7.29">coming in to the state government they</text>
  <text start="424.65" dur="8.579">have been declining all along so the</text>
  <text start="429.449" dur="6.15">last time this City surprise index were</text>
  <text start="433.229" dur="4.321">at these levels the Fed was about was</text>
  <text start="435.599" dur="4.141">about to launch Operation Twist to</text>
  <text start="437.55" dur="4.519">provide additional liquidity to the</text>
  <text start="439.74" dur="5.97">markets today</text>
  <text start="442.069" dur="7.03">the Fed is about to start to withdraw</text>
  <text start="445.71" dur="5.759">the liquidity from the markets and not a</text>
  <text start="449.099" dur="4.75">little ten billion per month this</text>
  <text start="451.469" dur="5.74">quarter and twenty billion per month</text>
  <text start="453.849" dur="5.61">in the fourth quarter of 2017 they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="457.209" dur="6.121">doing the exact opposite of what they</text>
  <text start="459.459" dur="7.08">did before the said basically is taking</text>
  <text start="463.33" dur="5.19">away the punchbowl from the markets now</text>
  <text start="466.539" dur="4.47">if we take this a step further we know</text>
  <text start="468.52" dur="6.06">that loan creation has stalled and</text>
  <text start="471.009" dur="5.97">falling and we see that the global</text>
  <text start="474.58" dur="4.169">central banks they&amp;#39;re going to be going</text>
  <text start="476.979" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re going to begin to withdraw its</text>
  <text start="478.749" dur="5.67">stimulus from their system the global</text>
  <text start="481.509" dur="5.64">credit is already decelerating at a pace</text>
  <text start="484.419" dur="6.42">not seen since the great crisis so when</text>
  <text start="487.149" dur="8.13">we look at the global credit impulse it</text>
  <text start="490.839" dur="7.55">is dropped dramatically and we&amp;#39;re on par</text>
  <text start="495.279" dur="7.14">to where we were between 2008 and 2009</text>
  <text start="498.389" dur="7.12">which means that this system is crashing</text>
  <text start="502.419" dur="7.25">and it&amp;#39;s coming down very very quickly</text>
  <text start="505.509" dur="8.431">we can see from all the evidence from</text>
  <text start="509.669" dur="6.461">retail to GDP to housing from people</text>
  <text start="513.94" dur="6.18">losing their jobs from the credit</text>
  <text start="516.13" dur="7.139">impulse from loan creation from</text>
  <text start="520.12" dur="5.88">corporate defaults from the corporate</text>
  <text start="523.269" dur="4.56">debt bomb from the stock market where</text>
  <text start="526" dur="3.389">people aren&amp;#39;t even investing in the</text>
  <text start="527.829" dur="3.391">market anymore it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="529.389" dur="4.411">controlled by the central banks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="531.22" dur="5.429">buying all the tech stocks trying to</text>
  <text start="533.8" dur="6.719">pump this system up and when we look at</text>
  <text start="536.649" dur="7.5">all this we can see we&amp;#39;ve been kept in</text>
  <text start="540.519" dur="4.861">this gigantic illusion for the last</text>
  <text start="544.149" dur="3.031">eight years I mean we&amp;#39;ve been an</text>
  <text start="545.38" dur="4.68">illusion for much much longer but the</text>
  <text start="547.18" dur="6.62">great illusion has been the last eight</text>
  <text start="550.06" dur="6.87">to nine years and this great illusion is</text>
  <text start="553.8" dur="6.13">coming to an end from everything that</text>
  <text start="556.93" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at we are already in</text>
  <text start="559.93" dur="4.95">a recession the government&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="562.42" dur="3.93">to mention it the Fed is definitely not</text>
  <text start="564.88" dur="3.809">going to mention it the only time</text>
  <text start="566.35" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re going to mention this is maybe</text>
  <text start="568.689" dur="4.471">six to eight months later when we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="570.85" dur="4.289">the collapse scenario they will let us</text>
  <text start="573.16" dur="4.2">know when the recession actually started</text>
  <text start="575.139" dur="4.591">and you will be surprised when it</text>
  <text start="577.36" dur="4.349">started most likely when we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="579.73" dur="5.52">saying it started and I think it started</text>
  <text start="581.709" dur="5.011">back in 2016 and we&amp;#39;ve been in this</text>
  <text start="585.25" dur="1.77">recession and the recession is just been</text>
  <text start="586.72" dur="2.91">getting</text>
  <text start="587.02" dur="5.43">worse all this time now the Fed is</text>
  <text start="589.63" dur="5.31">raising rates they&amp;#39;re accelerating the</text>
  <text start="592.45" dur="5.91">process and we can see by looking at all</text>
  <text start="594.94" dur="6.84">these different indicators things are</text>
  <text start="598.36" dur="6.81">rapidly falling apart and there is no</text>
  <text start="601.78" dur="5.13">stopping it they want the system to come</text>
  <text start="605.17" dur="3.72">down they&amp;#39;re trying to control the</text>
  <text start="606.91" dur="3.96">narrative they&amp;#39;re trying to place blame</text>
  <text start="608.89" dur="4.71">in another area think about what they</text>
  <text start="610.87" dur="5.48">wanted to do all along they wanted to</text>
  <text start="613.6" dur="5.07">create along with the deep state a</text>
  <text start="616.35" dur="5.05">one-world type of government this is why</text>
  <text start="618.67" dur="6.21">they were pushing TPP this is why</text>
  <text start="621.4" dur="6.75">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to push global</text>
  <text start="624.88" dur="8.85">warming they&amp;#39;ve been using all of this</text>
  <text start="628.15" dur="8.46">to create this illusion that they will</text>
  <text start="633.73" dur="6.15">control the world and they wanted court</text>
  <text start="636.61" dur="5.31">systems to sit above governments they</text>
  <text start="639.88" dur="5.22">wanted to bring each country down to a</text>
  <text start="641.92" dur="7.92">certain level to make them all even this</text>
  <text start="645.1" dur="7.56">was all part of their plan and if they</text>
  <text start="649.84" dur="4.74">remain in control remember they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="652.66" dur="3.69">this for the long haul they&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="654.58" dur="3.81">this to say okay next week we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="656.35" dur="5.51">complete control think about how long</text>
  <text start="658.39" dur="6.99">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to create this if</text>
  <text start="661.86" dur="5.41">they can continue on with this and they</text>
  <text start="665.38" dur="3.93">can keep the narrative and they can</text>
  <text start="667.27" dur="6.54">control the system they will have</text>
  <text start="669.31" dur="9.26">another 40 years on this fayette system</text>
  <text start="673.81" dur="7.77">and if they do keep control they will</text>
  <text start="678.57" dur="6.46">bring this entire world under a</text>
  <text start="681.58" dur="7.38">one-world system because that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="685.03" dur="6.81">their plan all along and we can see they</text>
  <text start="688.96" dur="5.13">don&amp;#39;t care how long it takes as long as</text>
  <text start="691.84" dur="4.2">they reach the goal think about what</text>
  <text start="694.09" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;ve been doing out in all different</text>
  <text start="696.04" dur="6.87">countries even when their objective may</text>
  <text start="700.6" dur="3.87">be get sidetracked they always stick to</text>
  <text start="702.91" dur="3.57">their goal and they always come back to</text>
  <text start="704.47" dur="3.6">it they don&amp;#39;t care how long it takes</text>
  <text start="706.48" dur="3.27">because they pass it down from</text>
  <text start="708.07" dur="5.79">generation to generation to generation</text>
  <text start="709.75" dur="7.26">and the central banking system has been</text>
  <text start="713.86" dur="5.28">here for quite a while they have control</text>
  <text start="717.01" dur="3.63">of quite a bit they&amp;#39;ve been gaining</text>
  <text start="719.14" dur="3.69">control</text>
  <text start="720.64" dur="3.3">over a lot of these countries where</text>
  <text start="722.83" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;ve been buying a lot of their</text>
  <text start="723.94" dur="4.95">assets they&amp;#39;ve been putting them further</text>
  <text start="726.01" dur="7.85">and further into debt and we can see</text>
  <text start="728.89" dur="8.31">right now that we cannot allow them to</text>
  <text start="733.86" dur="5.98">control the next collapse where they can</text>
  <text start="737.2" dur="5.01">control the narrative we need to call</text>
  <text start="739.84" dur="6.24">them out on it we need to say we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="742.21" dur="5.85">need a central bank and we know that the</text>
  <text start="746.08" dur="3.93">Trump administration they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="748.06" dur="4.17">working towards this and of course</text>
  <text start="750.01" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re trying to stop him they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="752.23" dur="5.58">want this to happen one thing for sure</text>
  <text start="755.47" dur="4.92">is we know that this system is going to</text>
  <text start="757.81" dur="4.5">come down one way or another it really</text>
  <text start="760.39" dur="4.47">doesn&amp;#39;t make a difference because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="762.31" dur="5.19">coming down because we&amp;#39;ve reached the</text>
  <text start="764.86" dur="4.86">end point of this system just like we</text>
  <text start="767.5" dur="4.26">were starting out in the 70s and we saw</text>
  <text start="769.72" dur="4.2">a hyperinflation actually we did see</text>
  <text start="771.76" dur="4.31">quite a bit of inflation back then where</text>
  <text start="773.92" dur="5.82">you saw a housing prices like double</text>
  <text start="776.07" dur="7.66">incomes like double we saw interest</text>
  <text start="779.74" dur="5.85">rates of you know 1718 percent as the</text>
  <text start="783.73" dur="3.24">dollar devalued now everyone thought</text>
  <text start="785.59" dur="4.25">that was great yes in the beginning of</text>
  <text start="786.97" dur="5.51">the system it seems incredibly fantastic</text>
  <text start="789.84" dur="5.68">here we are at the end of the system</text>
  <text start="792.48" dur="5.38">everything is completely opposite wages</text>
  <text start="795.52" dur="5.13">keep declining they can&amp;#39;t allow interest</text>
  <text start="797.86" dur="5.76">rates to go up it won&amp;#39;t work the dollar</text>
  <text start="800.65" dur="4.62">is continually devaluing they&amp;#39;re holding</text>
  <text start="803.62" dur="3.93">back the inflation because they know</text>
  <text start="805.27" dur="4.35">this would completely crash the system</text>
  <text start="807.55" dur="4.53">but they want to control what is</text>
  <text start="809.62" dur="4.65">happening this is why all these stimulus</text>
  <text start="812.08" dur="5.04">that he created never went into the</text>
  <text start="814.27" dur="5.43">hands of the people because more dollars</text>
  <text start="817.12" dur="5.16">in the hands of the people that would</text>
  <text start="819.7" dur="5.22">cause inflation they knew this this is</text>
  <text start="822.28" dur="4.59">why we&amp;#39;ve never really saw the inflation</text>
  <text start="824.92" dur="4.98">we were talking about yes we saw</text>
  <text start="826.87" dur="5.19">inflation in food and other places but</text>
  <text start="829.9" dur="3.6">the major inflation we never saw it</text>
  <text start="832.06" dur="4.4">because they pushed it into certain</text>
  <text start="833.5" dur="5.7">areas the stock market into the housing</text>
  <text start="836.46" dur="6.79">offshore this is what they&amp;#39;ve done all</text>
  <text start="839.2" dur="6.42">along now we&amp;#39;re coming to an end the</text>
  <text start="843.25" dur="3.9">system is coming to an end and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="845.62" dur="3.45">seeing everything that they did in the</text>
  <text start="847.15" dur="4.41">beginning we&amp;#39;re seeing the opposite</text>
  <text start="849.07" dur="5.52">happen right now and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="851.56" dur="6.06">try to maintain the control in</text>
  <text start="854.59" dur="5.37">till the very end but what you need to</text>
  <text start="857.62" dur="4.71">do is you need to get ready and prepared</text>
  <text start="859.96" dur="3.69">for what is coming because it&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="862.33" dur="3.87">no matter what you can see it there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="863.65" dur="4.17">signs all over the place and eventually</text>

  <text start="867.82" dur="2.49">system&amp;#39;s going to collapse</text>
  <text start="869.11" dur="2.55">just like eventually when those</text>
  <text start="870.31" dur="4.29">individuals looking at the subprime</text>
  <text start="871.66" dur="4.68">securities they knew back in 2006 they</text>
  <text start="874.6" dur="4.29">thought it was going to happen in 2007</text>
  <text start="876.34" dur="4.32">then they thought maybe midway through</text>
  <text start="878.89" dur="3.27">2007 it was going to happen maybe in the</text>
  <text start="880.66" dur="4.44">beginning of 2008 was going to happen</text>
  <text start="882.16" dur="6.06">but eventually what happened it did</text>
  <text start="885.1" dur="5.85">happen the system came down and that was</text>
  <text start="888.22" dur="4.05">it and they were proven right yes they</text>
