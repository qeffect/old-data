  <text start="207.45" dur="3.9">going to improve it&amp;#39;s not going to get</text>
  <text start="209.19" dur="4.47">better because the bubbles have been</text>
  <text start="211.35" dur="5.04">pumped up and now everything is coming</text>
  <text start="213.66" dur="5.94">down the entire economic system is based</text>
  <text start="216.39" dur="5.13">on a central bank illusion of course the</text>
  <text start="219.6" dur="4.08">government is included in creating this</text>
  <text start="221.52" dur="4.59">illusion where they manipulate all the</text>
  <text start="223.68" dur="5.13">calculations but this is done on purpose</text>
  <text start="226.11" dur="4.8">every single time to bring everyone into</text>
  <text start="228.81" dur="4.59">the economy actually to bring everyone</text>
  <text start="230.91" dur="4.56">into housing to bring everyone into the</text>
  <text start="233.4" dur="4.32">stock market to bring everyone into the</text>
  <text start="235.47" dur="4.26">places where they can pull the rug from</text>
  <text start="237.72" dur="3.69">out from under them and the whole thing</text>
  <text start="239.73" dur="4.11">collapses and people lose everything and</text>
  <text start="241.41" dur="4.41">they can purchase all these things for</text>
  <text start="243.84" dur="3.15">pennies on the dollar this is what</text>
  <text start="245.82" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;ve done in the past and they made</text>
  <text start="246.99" dur="5.91">themselves very very wealthy this is the</text>
  <text start="249.63" dur="6.3">central banking system this is not a</text>
  <text start="252.9" dur="6.3">people system they&amp;#39;ve convinced us</text>
  <text start="255.93" dur="5.88">through brainwashing over time that debt</text>
  <text start="259.2" dur="4.23">is good if people put more on their</text>
  <text start="261.81" dur="3.72">credit card it&amp;#39;s good if you take a loan</text>
  <text start="263.43" dur="4.17">out to get a car that&amp;#39;s good if you take</text>
  <text start="265.53" dur="4.74">out a huge mortgage that&amp;#39;s good to buy a</text>
  <text start="267.6" dur="5.1">house they&amp;#39;ve been convincing us of all</text>
  <text start="270.27" dur="5.22">of this for a very long time and now it</text>
  <text start="272.7" dur="5.49">is falling apart and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="275.49" dur="3.06">see the economic structure around the</text>
  <text start="278.19" dur="2.22">world</text>
  <text start="278.55" dur="3.57">well it&amp;#39;s deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="280.41" dur="3.72">quickly and they don&amp;#39;t know how to stop</text>
  <text start="282.12" dur="3.78">it they&amp;#39;ve stopped it in 2008 by</text>
  <text start="284.13" dur="4.71">creating a lot of currency but now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.9" dur="3.72">completely and just falling apart we see</text>
  <text start="288.84" dur="3.329">out in New Jersey</text>
  <text start="289.62" dur="4.71">looks like the governor there Phil</text>
  <text start="292.169" dur="6.031">Murphy and his administration they have</text>
  <text start="294.33" dur="6.45">a lot of problems in New Jersey and it</text>
  <text start="298.2" dur="6.12">looks like things are completely</text>
  <text start="300.78" dur="7.02">imploding in New Jersey now the state</text>
  <text start="304.32" dur="5.25">right now is pretty much broke they</text>
  <text start="307.8" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t have the funds to keep everything</text>
  <text start="309.57" dur="4.71">afloat and they&amp;#39;re trying to cut corners</text>
  <text start="312.24" dur="4.83">here and there what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="314.28" dur="5.62">about all this with their state pensions</text>
  <text start="317.07" dur="6.97">is that they just height it&amp;#39;s expected</text>
  <text start="319.9" dur="6">turn from 7% to 7.5% now remember this</text>
  <text start="324.04" dur="3.689">is based on the interest rate and we</text>
  <text start="325.9" dur="3.87">know the interest rates there at the</text>
  <text start="327.729" dur="2.551">lowest point we&amp;#39;ve seen in a very very</text>
  <text start="329.77" dur="3">long time</text>
  <text start="330.28" dur="4.889">there are nowhere near that type of</text>
  <text start="332.77" dur="4.8">return so what they&amp;#39;re using is the</text>
  <text start="335.169" dur="5.671">stock market if the stock market</text>
  <text start="337.57" dur="5.219">collapses guess what pensions they</text>
  <text start="340.84" dur="3.81">implode on themselves and that&amp;#39;s the end</text>
  <text start="342.789" dur="4.861">of that and most of the pensions are</text>
  <text start="344.65" dur="5.43">based on a stock market return and when</text>
  <text start="347.65" dur="3.72">everything goes south it&amp;#39;s really going</text>
  <text start="350.08" dur="3.69">to be a complete and utter disaster</text>
  <text start="351.37" dur="5.46">across the country and the question we</text>
  <text start="353.77" dur="7.04">have to ask ourself is if the economy is</text>
  <text start="356.83" dur="8.1">so great why are 78 million Americans</text>
  <text start="360.81" dur="5.859">hustling around for extra cash because</text>
  <text start="364.93" dur="4.38">the unemployment as we&amp;#39;ve been told is</text>
  <text start="366.669" dur="6.451">at 3.8 percent and if it&amp;#39;s so great why</text>
  <text start="369.31" dur="8.4">do people need extra jobs why do they</text>
  <text start="373.12" dur="6.389">have to three part-time jobs so when we</text>
  <text start="377.71" dur="5.73">look at this we have to say what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="379.509" dur="6.931">on here now remember the everyday normal</text>
  <text start="383.44" dur="6.24">job that&amp;#39;s dictated to us is 9:00 to</text>
  <text start="386.44" dur="4.89">5:00 the people that have jobs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="389.68" dur="4.47">not working 9:00 to 5:00 anymore they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="391.33" dur="4.92">working for hours in this job three</text>
  <text start="394.15" dur="4.59">hours in this job they might have</text>
  <text start="396.25" dur="3.72">another side job and this is what</text>
  <text start="398.74" dur="4.16">they&amp;#39;ve been doing for a very long time</text>
  <text start="399.97" dur="6.509">to make ends meet they&amp;#39;ve been trying to</text>
  <text start="402.9" dur="6.91">sell things on the side to make ends</text>
  <text start="406.479" dur="4.291">meet and they&amp;#39;ve been selling people out</text>
  <text start="409.81" dur="2.91">there been selling whatever they</text>
  <text start="410.77" dur="4.59">possibly can and when you look at this</text>
  <text start="412.72" dur="5.64">the most popular side hustles are</text>
  <text start="415.36" dur="9.179">selling goods online like Craigslist</text>
  <text start="418.36" dur="8.61">eBay housecleaning yard work babysitting</text>
  <text start="424.539" dur="6.031">and these are people with jobs now what</text>
  <text start="426.97" dur="6.09">has happened is everyone who had these</text>
  <text start="430.57" dur="4.43">high-paying jobs lost the high-paying</text>
  <text start="433.06" dur="4.65">jobs they might have gotten another job</text>
  <text start="435" dur="5.02">but it was for a lower salary or they</text>
  <text start="437.71" dur="5.61">couldn&amp;#39;t find that job in the same field</text>
  <text start="440.02" dur="4.98">and they had to take a part-time job now</text>
  <text start="443.32" dur="4.77">they couldn&amp;#39;t live on the one part-time</text>
  <text start="445" dur="5.94">job so they had it bring in a extra</text>
  <text start="448.09" dur="5.13">income just enough to survive this</text>
  <text start="450.94" dur="4.38">doesn&amp;#39;t mean they have extra money this</text>
  <text start="453.22" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re just making it every single day</text>
  <text start="455.32" dur="4.83">with what&amp;#39;s coming in and we see from</text>
  <text start="458.29" dur="4.41">what&amp;#39;s called a Federal Reserve survey</text>
  <text start="460.15" dur="5.7">and this is the survey of household</text>
  <text start="462.7" dur="5.13">economics and decision making well it</text>
  <text start="465.85" dur="4.08">delves into how people feel about their</text>
  <text start="467.83" dur="6">economic lives and why they make</text>
  <text start="469.93" dur="6.48">decisions they do now the shed as the</text>
  <text start="473.83" dur="4.92">abbreviation found that about 31 percent</text>
  <text start="476.41" dur="6.18">of adults participate in what the Fed</text>
  <text start="478.75" dur="6.51">called the gig economy work done outside</text>
  <text start="482.59" dur="6.63">of regular employment structures to make</text>
  <text start="485.26" dur="7.11">ends meet and about 78 million people</text>
  <text start="489.22" dur="6.66">are doing this actually it might even be</text>
  <text start="492.37" dur="5.52">a lot larger than this because the jobs</text>
  <text start="495.88" dur="4.05">they have today they&amp;#39;re just not making</text>
  <text start="497.89" dur="4.35">enough remember the Fed doesn&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="499.93" dur="4.77">inflation they&amp;#39;re saying that there is</text>
  <text start="502.24" dur="3.84">no inflation we haven&amp;#39;t even hit the</text>
  <text start="504.7" dur="3.93">inflation mark but if you look at</text>
  <text start="506.08" dur="4.65">housing if you look at automobiles if</text>
  <text start="508.63" dur="4.11">you look at college tuition if you look</text>
  <text start="510.73" dur="3.36">at the prices of food if you look at</text>
  <text start="512.74" dur="5.4">pretty much almost everything that you</text>
  <text start="514.09" dur="9.12">need today rents all of that has been</text>
  <text start="518.14" dur="6.54">inflated salaries non-existent we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="523.21" dur="3">talked about this in other reports where</text>
  <text start="524.68" dur="3.48">people haven&amp;#39;t received the cost of</text>
  <text start="526.21" dur="6.06">living in a very long time they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="528.16" dur="6.42">gotten raises and right now we see that</text>
  <text start="532.27" dur="4.41">this full employment is kind of</text>
  <text start="534.58" dur="5.43">meaningless because we know how they</text>
  <text start="536.68" dur="5.79">calculate this you know these 1 2 3</text>
  <text start="540.01" dur="5.73">part-time jobs is once before full-time</text>
  <text start="542.47" dur="5.73">jobs they&amp;#39;re basically manipulating</text>
  <text start="545.74" dur="3.78">everything making us believe that</text>
  <text start="548.2" dur="4.1">everything is great this is what they</text>
  <text start="549.52" dur="6">did prior to 2008 when we had that and</text>
  <text start="552.3" dur="4.69">collapse of the entire system they told</text>
  <text start="555.52" dur="4.71">us everything was great real estate fine</text>
  <text start="556.99" dur="4.8">subprime securities a okay contained the</text>
  <text start="560.23" dur="5.25">triple-a rated nothing to worry about</text>
  <text start="561.79" dur="5.94">but guess what it was a lie the same</text>
  <text start="565.48" dur="5.37">thing that&amp;#39;s happening right now it is a</text>
  <text start="567.73" dur="5.58">lie we see factory orders they have</text>
  <text start="570.85" dur="4.44">slumped right now they&amp;#39;re flip flopping</text>
  <text start="573.31" dur="3.3">up and down and basically what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="575.29" dur="2.79">happening they manipulate the numbers</text>
  <text start="576.61" dur="2.97">they don&amp;#39;t manipulate the numbers they</text>
  <text start="578.08" dur="3.57">fall that they manipulate them again</text>
  <text start="579.58" dur="5.34">revise the numbers and they keep doing</text>
  <text start="581.65" dur="5.17">this over and over and over because the</text>
  <text start="584.92" dur="4.63">system when it&amp;#39;s based on</text>
  <text start="586.82" dur="4.56">data you have to continually do this and</text>
  <text start="589.55" dur="3.93">this is why the numbers look the way</text>
  <text start="591.38" dur="4.95">they look the economy is not doing well</text>
  <text start="593.48" dur="6.12">and this is what the Patriots trying to</text>
  <text start="596.33" dur="7.23">do they&amp;#39;re trying to take the narrative</text>
  <text start="599.6" dur="6.24">and control it for the next downturn of</text>
  <text start="603.56" dur="4.53">the economy we know that Trump right now</text>
  <text start="605.84" dur="4.44">with others in his administration</text>
  <text start="608.09" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re pushing tariffs on many</text>
  <text start="610.28" dur="4.23">different countries in many different</text>
  <text start="611.66" dur="5.22">sectors and what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is</text>
  <text start="614.51" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re trying to bring the system down</text>
  <text start="616.88" dur="3">and control the narrative of what is</text>
  <text start="618.95" dur="4.14">happening right now</text>
  <text start="619.88" dur="5.28">control it away from the central banking</text>
  <text start="623.09" dur="4.08">system because they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="625.16" dur="4.2">central banking system to restart our</text>
  <text start="627.17" dur="4.38">system they want to restart it as a</text>
  <text start="629.36" dur="3.93">people system and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="631.55" dur="3.63">interesting as goldman sachs was out</text>
  <text start="633.29" dur="5.49">there and they said something very very</text>
  <text start="635.18" dur="8.01">interesting they said that in order for</text>
  <text start="638.78" dur="8.66">these tariffs to work the market has to</text>
  <text start="643.19" dur="7.26">crash first now that is very interesting</text>
  <text start="647.44" dur="5.44">where the stocks they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="650.45" dur="6.87">to come tumbling down now Trump did</text>
  <text start="652.88" dur="7.71">mention a while back that stocks may</text>
  <text start="657.32" dur="6.84">take a hit and people are going to feel</text>
  <text start="660.59" dur="5.94">the pain in the market we know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="664.16" dur="4.47">coming we know the markets going to come</text>
  <text start="666.53" dur="6.48">down we know the stock market is based</text>
  <text start="668.63" dur="6.9">on fake information it&amp;#39;s an illusion</text>
  <text start="673.01" dur="6.33">they can pump it up with a push of a</text>
  <text start="675.53" dur="5.49">button no problem and the reason why</text>
  <text start="679.34" dur="3.69">they need to bring this entire system</text>
  <text start="681.02" dur="6.12">down right now is because there is a</text>
  <text start="683.03" dur="6.09">major major move to move away from the</text>
  <text start="687.14" dur="4.05">dollar now we talked about China we</text>
  <text start="689.12" dur="6.89">talked about Russia we talked about Iran</text>
  <text start="691.19" dur="7.8">we talked about India what about Africa</text>
  <text start="696.01" dur="6.49">now if you notice it&amp;#39;s all the small</text>
  <text start="698.99" dur="5.73">emerging economies being shifted away</text>
  <text start="702.5" dur="4.71">and eventually what will happen is the</text>
  <text start="704.72" dur="4.11">larger economies will eventually shift</text>
  <text start="707.21" dur="6.21">away from the dollar but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="708.83" dur="9.21">happening right now is that in Africa we</text>
  <text start="713.42" dur="6.09">see that the African countries they were</text>
  <text start="718.04" dur="4.65">having a summit</text>
  <text start="719.51" dur="7.23">and they&amp;#39;re calling for you wanna</text>
  <text start="722.69" dur="5.76">fication the reason why they&amp;#39;re wanting</text>
  <text start="726.74" dur="5.4">to move to the u1 is because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="728.45" dur="7.59">saying that most of their business in</text>
  <text start="732.14" dur="7.74">Africa is with China not the United</text>
  <text start="736.04" dur="6.63">States and there&amp;#39;s no reason to use the</text>
  <text start="739.88" dur="4.65">dollar now you&amp;#39;re probably saying well</text>
  <text start="742.67" dur="4.8">what is this like one or two countries</text>
  <text start="744.53" dur="4.58">no this is fourteen countries where</text>
  <text start="747.47" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="749.11" dur="7.96">whatsoever to use the dollar we might as</text>
  <text start="753.35" dur="6.62">well use the yuan now this is what they</text>
  <text start="757.07" dur="5.85">said one of the issues we discussed</text>
  <text start="759.97" dur="5.05">though was that sometimes if you have</text>
  <text start="762.92" dur="5.07">borrowed from China they want to bill</text>
  <text start="765.02" dur="5.46">you in US dollars now we are saying our</text>
  <text start="767.99" dur="4.95">government must start discussing with</text>
  <text start="770.48" dur="5.31">Chinese enterprises and government so</text>
  <text start="772.94" dur="5.34">that were billed in you one and then we</text>
  <text start="775.79" dur="5.1">can pay in you one because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="778.28" dur="6.15">point if we start keeping our reserves</text>
  <text start="780.89" dur="7.11">in you one but were billed in dollars it</text>
  <text start="784.43" dur="5.43">is no good and this is coming from the</text>
  <text start="788" dur="5.25">African nations during the summit</text>
  <text start="789.86" dur="6.54">they&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s no reason to use</text>
  <text start="793.25" dur="6.9">the dollar in any of the transactions we</text>
  <text start="796.4" dur="6.8">might as well go right to the yuan so if</text>
  <text start="800.15" dur="6.59">we put all of this together we see that</text>
  <text start="803.2" dur="6.58">Syria is going to be looking to have</text>
  <text start="806.74" dur="3.88">business outside of the dollar Iran we</text>
  <text start="809.78" dur="4.11">already know they&amp;#39;re gonna deal with</text>
  <text start="810.62" dur="6.12">Europe and you in the euro or whatever</text>
  <text start="813.89" dur="6.51">currency they want to use we know that</text>
  <text start="816.74" dur="5.91">Iran is dealing with China in any other</text>
  <text start="820.4" dur="3.69">currency except the dollar we know that</text>
  <text start="822.65" dur="4.11">Russia is dealing with any other</text>
  <text start="824.09" dur="5.49">currency except the dollar we know that</text>
  <text start="826.76" dur="7.49">other countries like India we mentioned</text>
  <text start="829.58" dur="8.64">before Turkey now Africa Venezuela as</text>
  <text start="834.25" dur="6.94">you can see it&amp;#39;s starting to accelerate</text>
  <text start="838.22" dur="5.46">right now and this is going to move a</text>
  <text start="841.19" dur="6.12">lot faster and we need to remember</text>
  <text start="843.68" dur="5.79">nothing lasts forever if we go back in</text>
  <text start="847.31" dur="4.8">time and we look at the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="849.47" dur="5.46">status in the past</text>
  <text start="852.11" dur="5.13">you know hundreds of years we see if we</text>
  <text start="854.93" dur="5.909">go back in time in the 1400s it was</text>
  <text start="857.24" dur="5.4">Portugal and the 1500 it was Spain then</text>
  <text start="860.839" dur="4.921">it was the Netherlands then France then</text>
  <text start="862.64" dur="5.27">Britain here we are at the u.s. guess</text>
  <text start="865.76" dur="5.91">what time is up</text>
  <text start="867.91" dur="7.09">now the next country is going to get the</text>
  <text start="871.67" dur="5.909">reserve currency and we can see that</text>
  <text start="875" dur="5.25">this is being moved towards China do you</text>
  <text start="877.579" dur="4.741">want I mean we&amp;#39;ve been saying this for</text>
  <text start="880.25" dur="5.25">quite a while now they might try to put</text>
  <text start="882.32" dur="5.91">this into the basket of SDR s where the</text>
  <text start="885.5" dur="6.12">IMF can control it this is the central</text>
  <text start="888.23" dur="6.18">bank&amp;#39;s plan and I think other nations</text>
  <text start="891.62" dur="5.19">eventually even China I think they have</text>
  <text start="894.41" dur="4.29">a different plan in store I think</text>
  <text start="896.81" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to move away from the</text>
  <text start="898.7" dur="3.9">central banking system when everything</text>
  <text start="900.47" dur="4.26">is said and done so there&amp;#39;s gonna be a</text>
  <text start="902.6" dur="6.229">huge battle going on right now between</text>
  <text start="904.73" dur="6.93">the central banks and the countries and</text>
  <text start="908.829" dur="5.081">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to see where we go and</text>
  <text start="911.66" dur="4.71">whoever controls the narrative well</text>
  <text start="913.91" dur="4.98">that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re going and you can see</text>
  <text start="916.37" dur="5.1">this is why there&amp;#39;s a huge battle with</text>
  <text start="918.89" dur="4.71">the United States China it&amp;#39;s not United</text>
  <text start="921.47" dur="3.27">States against China their act both of</text>
  <text start="923.6" dur="3.599">these countries are actually working</text>
  <text start="924.74" dur="4.62">together to go against the central</text>
  <text start="927.199" dur="5.7">banking system and we&amp;#39;re gonna see that</text>
  <text start="929.36" dur="5.7">all of this is going to be a battle all</text>
  <text start="932.899" dur="3.69">the way up to the end and whoever</text>
  <text start="935.06" dur="4.2">controls the narrative and if we go back</text>
  <text start="936.589" dur="5.31">to 1971 who control the narrative back</text>
  <text start="939.26" dur="4.259">then it was the central bankers it was</text>
  <text start="941.899" dur="4.44">the deep state with the central bankers</text>
  <text start="943.519" dur="6">who told us there was a shortage of oil</text>
  <text start="946.339" dur="5.131">that&amp;#39;s why we couldn&amp;#39;t get the gas they</text>
  <text start="949.519" dur="4.141">were speculators in the market this is</text>
  <text start="951.47" dur="3.57">why we had to close the gold window this</text>
  <text start="953.66" dur="3.66">is why we couldn&amp;#39;t allow countries to</text>
  <text start="955.04" dur="4.43">get their gold back this wasn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="957.32" dur="4.68">reason at all they were removing</text>
  <text start="959.47" dur="4.869">everything off of the gold standard</text>
  <text start="962" dur="4.47">putting us on to their new system called</text>
  <text start="964.339" dur="4.471">the petro dollar but no one really knew</text>
  <text start="966.47" dur="5.309">about this back then so they made up</text>
  <text start="968.81" dur="7.2">this entire story of why all of this was</text>
  <text start="971.779" dur="7.471">happening and they kept that story going</text>
  <text start="976.01" dur="5.4">until today and now if the central banks</text>
  <text start="979.25" dur="4.26">have their way they&amp;#39;re going to make up</text>
  <text start="981.41" dur="3.7">another story that that&amp;#39;s what I mean by</text>
  <text start="983.51" dur="3.7">controlling the narrative</text>
  <text start="985.11" dur="4.23">if the Patriots controlled the narrative</text>
  <text start="987.21" dur="4.29">guess what we&amp;#39;re gonna see an audit of</text>
  <text start="989.34" dur="3.99">the central banking system the central</text>
  <text start="991.5" dur="2.76">banking system is going to be pushed out</text>
  <text start="993.33" dur="2.82">that doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re just going to</text>
  <text start="994.26" dur="3.6">just go away they&amp;#39;re gonna fight back</text>
  <text start="996.15" dur="4.98">any way they possibly can central banks</text>
  <text start="997.86" dur="5.76">have caused Wars throughout history to</text>
  <text start="1001.13" dur="5.13">keep their system alive</text>
  <text start="1003.62" dur="5.04">so here we are today and we can see</text>
  <text start="1006.26" dur="4.92">countries they&amp;#39;re starting to realize</text>
  <text start="1008.66" dur="4.89">what is going on and they&amp;#39;re moving away</text>
  <text start="1011.18" dur="5.22">from the dollar this is accelerating and</text>
  <text start="1013.55" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s just a matter of time before the</text>
  <text start="1016.4" dur="6.02">United States is no longer the reserve</text>
  <text start="1018.98" dur="5.37">currency and everything will then change</text>
