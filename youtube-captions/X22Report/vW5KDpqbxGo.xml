  <text start="33.1" dur="5.31">today&amp;#39;s date is December 5th 2014 and</text>
  <text start="36.1" dur="4.34">the title this episode is full-time jobs</text>
  <text start="38.41" dur="5.64">disappear as the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="40.44" dur="6.45">approaches let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="44.05" dur="5.37">collapse now we understand Europe is</text>
  <text start="46.89" dur="4.63">still having a problem I mean if we</text>
  <text start="49.42" dur="7.2">really look at this and we look at what</text>
  <text start="51.52" dur="7.14">happened in 1927 1928 1929 we saw Europe</text>
  <text start="56.62" dur="4.68">completely falling apart they were in a</text>
  <text start="58.66" dur="4.44">deep recession going into a depression</text>
  <text start="61.3" dur="3.45">and then we looked at the United States</text>
  <text start="63.1" dur="5">and we saw the stock market at all time</text>
  <text start="64.75" dur="5.219">new highs of about 400 or so points and</text>
  <text start="68.1" dur="3.519">when we looked at the real economic</text>
  <text start="69.969" dur="3.571">indicators around the country at that</text>
  <text start="71.619" dur="3.811">point in time we saw that people were</text>
  <text start="73.54" dur="3.509">losing jobs businesses were going out of</text>
  <text start="75.43" dur="3.39">business ten cities were starting to pop</text>
  <text start="77.049" dur="3.211">up but it really didn&amp;#39;t matter because</text>
  <text start="78.82" dur="4.409">everyone looked at the stock market</text>
  <text start="80.26" dur="4.77">again at that time and until the market</text>
  <text start="83.229" dur="4.731">came crashing down then everyone said</text>
  <text start="85.03" dur="6.269">hey the economy fell apart well the</text>
  <text start="87.96" dur="5.56">stock market is the last indicator to</text>
  <text start="91.299" dur="4.021">let you know yes we have reached the</text>
  <text start="93.52" dur="3.739">collapse and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="95.32" dur="5.1">right now we&amp;#39;re seeing Europe right now</text>
  <text start="97.259" dur="6.04">falling apart country by country by</text>
  <text start="100.42" dur="4.11">country it is a domino effect and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="103.299" dur="4.14">seeing that it&amp;#39;s starting to affect</text>
  <text start="104.53" dur="5.19">Germany the Deutsche Bundesbank said</text>
  <text start="107.439" dur="5.43">gross domestic product which is GDP and</text>
  <text start="109.72" dur="6.03">Germany is expected to grow at only 1%</text>
  <text start="112.869" dur="4.831">next year half of what a predicted</text>
  <text start="115.75" dur="5.64">earlier for this year now we have to</text>
  <text start="117.7" dur="5.459">remember the start of this year most of</text>
  <text start="121.39" dur="3.9">the economist and the central bank said</text>
  <text start="123.159" dur="4.86">hey this year looks fantastic and they</text>
  <text start="125.29" dur="4.619">were back in 2013 like in a November</text>
  <text start="128.019" dur="4.86">December time period and they said</text>
  <text start="129.909" dur="7.321">listen 2014 we&amp;#39;re going to see growth of</text>
  <text start="132.879" dur="7.59">between 2.5 and 3.0 GDP and it looks</text>
  <text start="137.23" dur="3.63">absolutely fantastic now of course that</text>
  <text start="140.469" dur="2.551">didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="140.86" dur="4.59">happen and of course the central bankers</text>
  <text start="143.02" dur="4.08">like us and they try to make us believe</text>
  <text start="145.45" dur="4.2">that things are a lot better than they</text>
  <text start="147.1" dur="4.44">are because they&amp;#39;re trying to keep us in</text>
  <text start="149.65" dur="3.9">the illusion but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="151.54" dur="3.81">now is they&amp;#39;re continually revising all</text>
  <text start="153.55" dur="3.75">of their numbers and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="155.35" dur="4.59">the rest of this year the growth is only</text>
  <text start="157.3" dur="4.38">going to be about 1.4 percent in Germany</text>
  <text start="159.94" dur="4.35">instead of one point nine percent so it</text>
  <text start="161.68" dur="5.04">has dropped dramatically and next year</text>
  <text start="164.29" dur="5.13">it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot worse because how</text>
  <text start="166.72" dur="6.39">all of a sudden is it going to be better</text>
  <text start="169.42" dur="6.48">it can&amp;#39;t be it&amp;#39;s impossible and this is</text>
  <text start="173.11" dur="5.61">why they are continually trying to</text>
  <text start="175.9" dur="4.02">convince us that everything will be okay</text>
  <text start="178.72" dur="3.78">because they&amp;#39;re trying to get this big</text>
  <text start="179.92" dur="5.43">event started here to cover up this</text>
  <text start="182.5" dur="5.43">major major collapse that is coming now</text>
  <text start="185.35" dur="5.31">out in Canada we see the job market has</text>
  <text start="187.93" dur="3.84">been cooling off in november shedding</text>
  <text start="190.66" dur="3.329">about ten thousand seven hundred</text>
  <text start="191.77" dur="4.65">positions after two consecutive months</text>
  <text start="193.989" dur="4.231">of big gains and what&amp;#39;s very strange is</text>
  <text start="196.42" dur="3.18">you think that the job market would be</text>
  <text start="198.22" dur="3.6">getting better because we&amp;#39;re coming into</text>
  <text start="199.6" dur="4.139">the holiday season right now and more</text>
  <text start="201.82" dur="4.56">and more jobs or pork time jobs are</text>
  <text start="203.739" dur="4.771">being put into place and more people</text>
  <text start="206.38" dur="4.139">will be employed but we&amp;#39;re really not</text>
  <text start="208.51" dur="4.05">seeing that for some reason the</text>
  <text start="210.519" dur="3.961">unemployment rate age edged up to about</text>
  <text start="212.56" dur="4.23">six point six percent from six point</text>
  <text start="214.48" dur="4.05">five percent in October analysts had</text>
  <text start="216.79" dur="3.87">expected an increase of about five</text>
  <text start="218.53" dur="4.98">thousand jobs after 43 thousand one</text>
  <text start="220.66" dur="4.59">hundred recreated in October and 74</text>
  <text start="223.51" dur="3.479">thousand in September the labor</text>
  <text start="225.25" dur="4.19">participation rate which is particularly</text>
  <text start="226.989" dur="5.131">interest of the Bank of Canada stayed at</text>
  <text start="229.44" dur="6.67">sixty-six percent the lowest since</text>
  <text start="232.12" dur="6.42">november 2001 and we can see that people</text>
  <text start="236.11" dur="4.62">losing their jobs the unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="238.54" dur="4.59">ticking up is starting to happen all</text>
  <text start="240.73" dur="5.28">across the globe canada&amp;#39;s seeing</text>
  <text start="243.13" dur="4.35">australia seeing it germany is seeing it</text>
  <text start="246.01" dur="4.86">it might not be going up very quickly</text>
  <text start="247.48" dur="5.37">but is ticking up very slowly and once</text>
  <text start="250.87" dur="4.56">this thing starts to accelerate you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="252.85" dur="6.18">going to see things completely skyrocket</text>
  <text start="255.43" dur="6.059">look what happened in 2008 right before</text>
  <text start="259.03" dur="4.949">the stock market crashed unemployment</text>
  <text start="261.489" dur="5.281">was ticking up very very slowly and then</text>
  <text start="263.979" dur="5.521">all of a sudden right after that when</text>
  <text start="266.77" dur="4.8">the indic the last indicator to let you</text>
  <text start="269.5" dur="3.99">know the economy failed all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="271.57" dur="3.06">the unemployment just shot up companies</text>
  <text start="273.49" dur="3.9">laid off left and right</text>
  <text start="274.63" dur="5.04">that was their excuse the same thing is</text>
  <text start="277.39" dur="4.47">going to happen again all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="279.67" dur="3.21">things are going to fall apart and of</text>
  <text start="281.86" dur="2.76">course it&amp;#39;s going to be blamed on</text>
  <text start="282.88" dur="3.21">another organization or another country</text>
  <text start="284.62" dur="3.15">and you&amp;#39;re going to see unemployment</text>
  <text start="286.09" dur="4.32">skyrocket not just here in the United</text>
  <text start="287.77" dur="4.65">States but all over all the private</text>
  <text start="290.41" dur="5.01">western central bank countries are going</text>
  <text start="292.42" dur="4.89">to feel the effect now out in France we</text>
  <text start="295.42" dur="3.96">understand that unemployment there is</text>
  <text start="297.31" dur="4.35">horrific we understand the youth</text>
  <text start="299.38" dur="6.86">unemployment is absolutely terrible</text>
  <text start="301.66" dur="9.09">people cannot find jobs and a town in</text>
  <text start="306.24" dur="8.14">France was forcing the homeless to wear</text>
  <text start="310.75" dur="6.66">yellow ID triangles French authorities</text>
  <text start="314.38" dur="4.89">have now abandoned the the homeless</text>
  <text start="317.41" dur="4.62">requiring them to wear a yellow triangle</text>
  <text start="319.27" dur="4.92">card that identified their suspected</text>
  <text start="322.03" dur="3.48">illness so you would be sitting there</text>
  <text start="324.19" dur="3.9">homeless and you would have a little</text>
  <text start="325.51" dur="4.38">marker on you to let everyone know that</text>
  <text start="328.09" dur="3.6">first of all you&amp;#39;re homeless but they</text>
  <text start="329.89" dur="3.09">could tell that you are or maybe you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="331.69" dur="3.24">just walking down the street and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="332.98" dur="3.72">homeless and you had this little marker</text>
  <text start="334.93" dur="3.96">on you saying that yes Here I am</text>
  <text start="336.7" dur="3.78">homeless and these are the diseases I</text>
  <text start="338.89" dur="4.98">have can you imagine walking around</text>
  <text start="340.48" dur="6.87">saying I have herpes I have AIDS I have</text>
  <text start="343.87" dur="7.68">cancer I have you know diabetes this is</text>
  <text start="347.35" dur="6.12">absolutely ridiculous and right now they</text>
  <text start="351.55" dur="4.98">were saying that the original intention</text>
  <text start="353.47" dur="5.85">of the initiative was to help the</text>
  <text start="356.53" dur="5.04">homeless and help the health workers</text>
  <text start="359.32" dur="4.38">when they pick them up so they knew what</text>
  <text start="361.57" dur="4.02">they had so they can treat them and this</text>
  <text start="363.7" dur="4.86">is absolutely ridiculous this is what</text>
  <text start="365.59" dur="5.88">they always use no no this is for your</text>
  <text start="368.56" dur="5.04">benefit not for us we&amp;#39;re trying to help</text>
  <text start="371.47" dur="3.93">you well guess what why doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="373.6" dur="4.62">everybody have that wouldn&amp;#39;t that help</text>
  <text start="375.4" dur="5.04">everybody where they can just look at</text>
  <text start="378.22" dur="5.37">your tag and see what illnesses you have</text>
  <text start="380.44" dur="5.76">no this was a marker to distinguish and</text>
  <text start="383.59" dur="5.37">who was homeless and who wasn&amp;#39;t but of</text>
  <text start="386.2" dur="6.63">course this was completely abandoned</text>
  <text start="388.96" dur="6.27">right now Renee juror Carly said it is</text>
  <text start="392.83" dur="5.39">finished there won&amp;#39;t be any more cards</text>
  <text start="395.23" dur="5.79">like this we were heading into Nazi</text>
  <text start="398.22" dur="5.89">territory where they had people where</text>
  <text start="401.02" dur="6.69">the Jewish people had they wore the</text>
  <text start="404.11" dur="4.47">yellow star on their arm and we can see</text>
  <text start="407.71" dur="5.25">the same thing</text>
  <text start="408.58" dur="6.6">was starting to happen once again now</text>
  <text start="412.96" dur="4.29">here in the United States we see that</text>
  <text start="415.18" dur="4.32">the US has added about three hundred and</text>
  <text start="417.25" dur="4.469">twenty-one thousand jobs in November the</text>
  <text start="419.5" dur="5.09">most since 2012 unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="421.719" dur="5.79">remains at five point eight percent and</text>
  <text start="424.59" dur="4.479">we have to really look at the numbers</text>
  <text start="427.509" dur="4.37">and try to understand what is going on</text>
  <text start="429.069" dur="5.581">here part-time jobs which rose about</text>
  <text start="431.879" dur="6.51">77,000 while full-time jobs have</text>
  <text start="434.65" dur="6.18">declined by a hundred and fifty thousand</text>
  <text start="438.389" dur="3.671">participation rate remained flat at</text>
  <text start="440.83" dur="4.38">sixty two point eight percent</text>
  <text start="442.06" dur="6.27">essentially the lowest print since 1978</text>
  <text start="445.21" dur="5.759">driven by a 69,000 worker increase in</text>
  <text start="448.33" dur="4.86">people not in the labor force so we can</text>
  <text start="450.969" dur="5.311">see right now there are less people in</text>
  <text start="453.19" dur="5.839">the labor force and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="456.28" dur="6.569">that full-time jobs have declined and</text>
  <text start="459.029" dur="5.92">part-time jobs are increasing the ratio</text>
  <text start="462.849" dur="3.75">of civilian employment to the total</text>
  <text start="464.949" dur="4.411">population which plunged during the</text>
  <text start="466.599" dur="5.97">onset of the recession has still barely</text>
  <text start="469.36" dur="5.85">budged hire young people those aged 16</text>
  <text start="472.569" dur="5.31">to 24 are finally entering the workforce</text>
  <text start="475.21" dur="5.609">in droves sadly that is not the case</text>
  <text start="477.879" dur="5.07">once again with the employed ranks of</text>
  <text start="480.819" dur="4.231">Americans in that age group down by a</text>
  <text start="482.949" dur="4.741">hundred and sixty nine thousand in the</text>
  <text start="485.05" dur="5.429">past month and we&amp;#39;ve said this over and</text>
  <text start="487.69" dur="4.71">over again those youths who are trying</text>
  <text start="490.479" dur="3.36">to find work those coming out of college</text>
  <text start="492.4" dur="3.419">that was coming out of high school</text>
  <text start="493.839" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re having a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="495.819" dur="5.28">especially college graduates they cannot</text>
  <text start="498.219" dur="5.551">find work in their major they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="501.099" dur="4.44">part time work actually I know a couple</text>
  <text start="503.77" dur="4.769">of people who have graduated college</text>
  <text start="505.539" dur="5.25">they are still looking for work and yes</text>
  <text start="508.539" dur="4.531">they do have student loans and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="510.789" dur="4.5">saying it is very very difficult to find</text>
  <text start="513.07" dur="4.769">jobs in their majors so they have taken</text>
  <text start="515.289" dur="4.74">part time jobs in there working per hour</text>
  <text start="517.839" dur="4.171">at this time but again they can&amp;#39;t leave</text>
  <text start="520.029" dur="3.99">their parents home they have student</text>
  <text start="522.01" dur="4.86">loans coming up and it is very difficult</text>
  <text start="524.019" dur="4.471">to survive but where are all these jobs</text>
  <text start="526.87" dur="4.64">that they&amp;#39;re talking about that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="528.49" dur="5.73">recovering well here&amp;#39;s the breakdown</text>
  <text start="531.51" dur="5.05">professional services excluding temp</text>
  <text start="534.22" dur="4.8">help was about 63,000 of which</text>
  <text start="536.56" dur="5.79">administrative assistants 12,000</text>
  <text start="539.02" dur="5.36">bookkeepers about 16,000 retail trade</text>
  <text start="542.35" dur="4.26">about 50,000 of course we would see a</text>
  <text start="544.38" dur="4.51">increase in this because we&amp;#39;re coming up</text>
  <text start="546.61" dur="4.02">to the holiday season and again as we</text>
  <text start="548.89" dur="3.75">know once the holiday season is over</text>
  <text start="550.63" dur="4.73">come the end of January they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="552.64" dur="5.69">let all those workers disappear and</text>
  <text start="555.36" dur="5.32">there&amp;#39;ll be no jobs once again and</text>
  <text start="558.33" dur="3.94">people will be struggling because they</text>
  <text start="560.68" dur="5.67">will have no work leisure and</text>
  <text start="562.27" dur="6.09">hospitality 38,000 of which waiters and</text>
  <text start="566.35" dur="4.86">bartenders were about 26,000</text>
  <text start="568.36" dur="4.47">manufacturing was about 28,000 and temp</text>
  <text start="571.21" dur="6.63">help was almost the same as</text>
  <text start="572.83" dur="6.81">manufacturing at 22,000 jobs so we can</text>
  <text start="577.84" dur="4.32">see right now that is the breakdown</text>
  <text start="579.64" dur="5.43">we&amp;#39;re not seeing many corporations</text>
  <text start="582.16" dur="5.79">higher here they are laying off at this</text>
  <text start="585.07" dur="5.61">point and again this is why we are</text>
  <text start="587.95" dur="4.53">seeing the retail sales completely</text>
  <text start="590.68" dur="5.91">fallen we have an unemployment rate of</text>
  <text start="592.48" dur="6.66">five point eight percent but prior years</text>
  <text start="596.59" dur="6.8">the unemployment rate was higher and we</text>
  <text start="599.14" dur="6.42">had better sales so somebody is</text>
  <text start="603.39" dur="4.06">manipulating the numbers and we know who</text>
  <text start="605.56" dur="5.1">that somebody would somebody is it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="607.45" dur="5.61">US government and central bankers now in</text>
  <text start="610.66" dur="5.82">the real world where people regularly</text>
  <text start="613.06" dur="5.25">eat food we see inflation and if we</text>
  <text start="616.48" dur="4.05">really calculate it out we see that</text>
  <text start="618.31" dur="5.4">inflation is around ten percent and also</text>
  <text start="620.53" dur="5.52">if we go to John Williams his website</text>
  <text start="623.71" dur="5.58">shadow stats we can see that inflation</text>
  <text start="626.05" dur="6.21">is around this area when we subtract a</text>
  <text start="629.29" dur="5.04">realistic estimate of inflation once we</text>
  <text start="632.26" dur="4.92">get even close to ten percent suddenly a</text>

  <text start="810.72" dur="4.5">hoping that this holiday season is going</text>
  <text start="813.54" dur="3.81">to really help them and we already see</text>
  <text start="815.22" dur="6.27">stores that are not going to make it</text>
  <text start="817.35" dur="5.61">Sears JC Penney radio shack believe me</text>
  <text start="821.49" dur="3.66">there&amp;#39;s going to be many more than this</text>

  <text start="829.59" dur="3.93">close a lot of the stores and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="831.63" dur="6.81">going to see a lot of plazas become</text>
  <text start="833.52" dur="7.2">empty now we see that factory orders now</text>
  <text start="838.44" dur="4.05">have tumbled this is the most since</text>

  <text start="847.56" dur="5.28">so we can see right now that things are</text>
  <text start="850.41" dur="5.07">still not going well and factories</text>
  <text start="852.84" dur="4.53">orders are down now to help the real</text>

  <text start="881.4" dur="5.13">now if the housing market was recovering</text>
  <text start="883.86" dur="5.01">why are they still purchasing these</text>
  <text start="886.53" dur="4.35">mortgage-backed securities the reason</text>
  <text start="888.87" dur="4.8">for it is because the housing market is</text>
  <text start="890.88" dur="8.1">not recovering it&amp;#39;s an illusion and they</text>
  <text start="893.67" dur="7.2">have to keep the illusion alive now out</text>

  <text start="984.48" dur="5.969">the United States is trying to overthrow</text>
  <text start="987.899" dur="5.88">the government of China at this point</text>

  <text start="1219.95" dur="5.13">seems like there wasn&amp;#39;t enough in the</text>

  <text start="1331.46" dur="5.219">executive order and the question is what</text>
  <text start="1334.07" dur="5.339">is a presidential memorandum well it is</text>
  <text start="1336.679" dur="4.141">a type of executive instrument typically</text>

  <text start="1349.549" dur="6.181">United States government and this could</text>
  <text start="1351.98" dur="6.48">be what he created but he did not create</text>
  <text start="1355.73" dur="5.85">an executive order it does not exist</text>
  <text start="1358.46" dur="5.7">right now on the site and nobody at this</text>
  <text start="1361.58" dur="5.64">point can locate it so did he really</text>
  <text start="1364.16" dur="7.259">sign an executive order that really is</text>
  <text start="1367.22" dur="6.959">the question now Congress does have the</text>
  <text start="1371.419" dur="4.441">power to define any federal agency even</text>
  <text start="1374.179" dur="2.61">an agency funded through fees the</text>
  <text start="1375.86" dur="3.72">Congressional Research Service</text>
  <text start="1376.789" dur="4.681">determined in a letter we last last week</text>
  <text start="1379.58" dur="3.69">the letter requested by Republican</text>
  <text start="1381.47" dur="4.05">lawmaker addressed an issue raised by</text>
  <text start="1383.27" dur="5.159">the House Appropriations chairman Hal</text>
  <text start="1385.52" dur="5.67">Rogers who claimed it is impossible for</text>
  <text start="1388.429" dur="4.23">Republicans to defund Obama&amp;#39;s amnesty</text>
  <text start="1391.19" dur="3.239">since the agency in charge of issuing</text>

  <text start="1396.26" dur="5.94">Service office is almost entirely funded</text>
  <text start="1398.96" dur="6.68">by user fees the CRS found that Rogers</text>
  <text start="1402.2" dur="6">claimed was completely false in light of</text>
  <text start="1405.64" dur="4.84">Congress&amp;#39;s constitutional power over the</text>
  <text start="1408.2" dur="5.4">purse the Supreme Court has recognized</text>
  <text start="1410.48" dur="5.55">that Congress may also circumscribe</text>
  <text start="1413.6" dur="5.01">agency discretion to allocate resources</text>
  <text start="1416.03" dur="5.22">by putting restrictions in the operative</text>
  <text start="1418.61" dur="5.569">statutes where Congress has done so an</text>
  <text start="1421.25" dur="5.52">agency is not free simply to disregard</text>
  <text start="1424.179" dur="5.701">statutory responsibilities therefore if</text>
  <text start="1426.77" dur="5.73">a statute were enacted which prohibited</text>
  <text start="1429.88" dur="5.26">appropriated funds from being used for</text>
  <text start="1432.5" dur="4.74">some specified purposes then the</text>
  <text start="1435.14" dur="5.039">relevant funds would be unavailable to</text>
  <text start="1437.24" dur="6.299">be obligated oryx or expended for those</text>
  <text start="1440.179" dur="6.63">purposes so right now what we&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1443.539" dur="8.37">is that Congress does have the ability</text>
  <text start="1446.809" dur="7.081">to defund the amnesty a well executive</text>
  <text start="1451.909" dur="5.281">order which really isn&amp;#39;t a sign maybe</text>
  <text start="1453.89" dur="5.19">the memorandums that he signed but right</text>
  <text start="1457.19" dur="5.67">now they do have the power to do this so</text>
  <text start="1459.08" dur="6.18">right now it looks like the Congress is</text>
  <text start="1462.86" dur="6.71">putting together a bill the House of</text>
  <text start="1465.26" dur="6.75">Representatives and the bill is HR 57 59</text>
  <text start="1469.57" dur="5.12">preventing executive overreach on</text>
  <text start="1472.01" dur="6.31">immigration act of 2014</text>
  <text start="1474.69" dur="5.85">and it looks like President Obama with</text>
  <text start="1478.32" dur="5.64">the advice from his advisors is going to</text>
  <text start="1480.54" dur="6.12">veto it so his executive order which we</text>
  <text start="1483.96" dur="4.38">cannot find is going to stand and I</text>
  <text start="1486.66" dur="4.17">don&amp;#39;t know why they didn&amp;#39;t place this</text>
  <text start="1488.34" dur="6.69">executive order on the website and this</text>
  <text start="1490.83" dur="7.95">is very confusing of why it wasn&amp;#39;t okay</text>
  <text start="1495.03" dur="6.15">now we realize the government would love</text>
  <text start="1498.78" dur="5.79">to control the flow of information I</text>
  <text start="1501.18" dur="4.8">mean we see in Ukraine where the US has</text>
  <text start="1504.57" dur="2.94">their fingers in there they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1511.13" dur="3.49">Ministry of Information because they</text>
  <text start="1513.24" dur="3.36">want to control the flow of information</text>
  <text start="1514.62" dur="5.04">here in the United States a little bit</text>
  <text start="1516.6" dur="5.97">tougher and we have alternative media or</text>
  <text start="1519.66" dur="4.62">the new media out there trying to pretty</text>
  <text start="1522.57" dur="3.6">much debunk everything the government is</text>
  <text start="1524.28" dur="4.2">trying to tell us and show that know</text>
  <text start="1526.17" dur="4.11">these things are not true and this is</text>
  <text start="1528.48" dur="3.81">what&amp;#39;s really happening in the world and</text>
  <text start="1530.28" dur="4.08">we can see they don&amp;#39;t like this</text>
  <text start="1532.29" dur="5.73">whatsoever and they&amp;#39;re trying to pass</text>
  <text start="1534.36" dur="5.52">bills trying to make it make it like you</text>
  <text start="1538.02" dur="3.57">need to get a license to report the news</text>
  <text start="1539.88" dur="3.78">that there only can be certain</text>
  <text start="1541.59" dur="4.62">journalists with these licenses that can</text>
  <text start="1543.66" dur="4.26">do anything and they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="1546.21" dur="3.69">all this through their can trying to</text>
  <text start="1547.92" dur="5.85">control the Internet in certain ways and</text>
  <text start="1549.9" dur="6">again they don&amp;#39;t want the new media out</text>
  <text start="1553.77" dur="3.81">there reporting on anything they want</text>
  <text start="1555.9" dur="4.35">all the information coming from the</text>
  <text start="1557.58" dur="5.67">corporate owned news agencies that they</text>
  <text start="1560.25" dur="5.16">can control they submit the new sources</text>
  <text start="1563.25" dur="4.53">to them that&amp;#39;s what they report there is</text>
  <text start="1565.41" dur="5.22">no investigation reporting anymore they</text>
  <text start="1567.78" dur="6.39">don&amp;#39;t do it and we&amp;#39;ve seen that there</text>
  <text start="1570.63" dur="7.86">are signs that they&amp;#39;re starting to block</text>
  <text start="1574.17" dur="7.64">the alternative media sites and we can</text>
  <text start="1578.49" dur="7.59">see that they&amp;#39;re doing this with</text>
  <text start="1581.81" dur="6.58">throttling the internet and basically</text>
  <text start="1586.08" dur="4.56">the US and other governments have</text>
  <text start="1588.39" dur="4.53">contingencies in place to block or</text>
  <text start="1590.64" dur="4.56">obscure online news sources by way of</text>
  <text start="1592.92" dur="4.68">regional internet hubs the idea is</text>
  <text start="1595.2" dur="4.38">simple keep citizens from seeing any</text>
  <text start="1597.6" dur="4.35">alternative reporting or analysis in</text>
  <text start="1599.58" dur="5.35">times of crisis or domestic strife the</text>
  <text start="1601.95" dur="5.62">number of top alternative news sites</text>
  <text start="1604.93" dur="5.31">have noticed that web sites have been</text>
  <text start="1607.57" dur="5.31">offline in certain regions at certain</text>
  <text start="1610.24" dur="5.4">times others have noticed and documented</text>
  <text start="1612.88" dur="4.83">the same observation online new sites to</text>
  <text start="1615.64" dur="4.35">be blacked out during the next major</text>
  <text start="1617.71" dur="3.78">catastrophic event now we have to</text>
  <text start="1619.99" dur="4.32">remember every time there is some type</text>
  <text start="1621.49" dur="6">of event like Sandy Hook or the Boston</text>
  <text start="1624.31" dur="5.1">bombing 911 the alternative media&amp;#39;s out</text>

  <text start="1629.41" dur="6.26">inconsistencies and why this can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1631.42" dur="8.34">true so why are they doing this well</text>
  <text start="1635.67" dur="6.25">when the next major event occurs where</text>
  <text start="1639.76" dur="3.42">the government wants its official</text>
  <text start="1641.92" dur="4.86">narrative to be the only information</text>
  <text start="1643.18" dur="6.54">allowed to circulate they will pretty</text>
  <text start="1646.78" dur="6.51">much throttle or block the alternative</text>
  <text start="1649.72" dur="5.16">media and what are these events going to</text>
  <text start="1653.29" dur="4.44">be well it&amp;#39;s going to be a terrorist</text>
  <text start="1654.88" dur="5.28">event false flag event and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1657.73" dur="4.14">want the alternative media reporting on</text>
  <text start="1660.16" dur="4.65">this and you have to remember when the</text>
  <text start="1661.87" dur="5.13">beheading videos first came out with the</text>
  <text start="1664.81" dur="4.53">Islamic state everyone started pointing</text>
  <text start="1667" dur="4.38">out all the inconsistencies saying this</text>
  <text start="1669.34" dur="4.32">can&amp;#39;t be real and of course in you in</text>
  <text start="1671.38" dur="5.52">the UK they said anyone that looks at</text>
  <text start="1673.66" dur="4.38">these videos or is now deemed a</text>
  <text start="1676.9" dur="3.36">terrorist anyone that looks at the</text>
  <text start="1678.04" dur="4.08">beheading video the original one you are</text>
  <text start="1680.26" dur="3.48">a terrorist and then they started taking</text>
  <text start="1682.12" dur="3.48">down the beheading videos very very</text>
  <text start="1683.74" dur="4.35">quickly because they realize they made</text>
  <text start="1685.6" dur="5.67">so many mistakes creating them and we</text>
  <text start="1688.09" dur="5.43">can see right now we are headed towards</text>
  <text start="1691.27" dur="5.88">another false flag event and we can see</text>
  <text start="1693.52" dur="5.7">that yes they will be taking down or</text>
  <text start="1697.15" dur="4.02">blocking certain sites i noticed the</text>
  <text start="1699.22" dur="3.66">other day when i need an internet</text>

  <text start="1710.62" dur="3.9">getting to certain news sites you will</text>
  <text start="1712.39" dur="4.47">see that they have already started</text>
