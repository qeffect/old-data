  <text start="57.13" dur="5.63">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.6" dur="6.66">episode 1609 bien today&amp;#39;s date is July 6</text>
  <text start="62.76" dur="5.68">2018 and the thought of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.26" dur="6.81">the moves are never telegraphed it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="68.44" dur="5.79">happening behind closed doors let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="72.07" dur="4.98">into the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="74.23" dur="4.92">geopolitical news now we know that the</text>
  <text start="77.05" dur="5.88">deep state they are backed into a corner</text>
  <text start="79.15" dur="8.19">and it looks like we have arrived at a</text>
  <text start="82.93" dur="7.29">crucial period of time we know that the</text>
  <text start="87.34" dur="4.47">House Resolution set Friday the deadline</text>
  <text start="90.22" dur="3.45">for the Justice Department to come clean</text>
  <text start="91.81" dur="4.919">on the beginning of its investigation</text>
  <text start="93.67" dur="5.309">into the Trump campaign we will find out</text>
  <text start="96.729" dur="6.421">if the FBI has been lying to the public</text>
  <text start="98.979" dur="6.301">that is if the department complies it</text>
  <text start="103.15" dur="3.78">has clouded so many subpoenas and played</text>
  <text start="105.28" dur="3.57">so many games with redaction and</text>
  <text start="106.93" dur="4.049">deadlines that the entire House GOP</text>
  <text start="108.85" dur="3.96">United last week to vote for the</text>
  <text start="110.979" dur="4.921">resolution demanding submission to</text>
  <text start="112.81" dur="6.21">Congress requests for documents the vote</text>
  <text start="115.9" dur="5.34">was in order but also a warning that</text>
  <text start="119.02" dur="6.06">this is the last chance to comply and</text>
  <text start="121.24" dur="6.51">the next step will be to hold officials</text>
  <text start="125.08" dur="6.48">in contempt so what is the issue the</text>
  <text start="127.75" dur="6.75">issue is the FBI&amp;#39;s origin story in which</text>
  <text start="131.56" dur="5.1">it claims its full-fledged investigation</text>
  <text start="134.5" dur="6.42">into a presidential campaign was</text>
  <text start="136.66" dur="7.71">conducted as it were by the book now the</text>
  <text start="140.92" dur="6">story as we know is full of holes they</text>
  <text start="144.37" dur="4.76">are now widening no one has explained</text>
  <text start="146.92" dur="5.31">why two months passed between the</text>
  <text start="149.13" dur="5.41">Papadopoulos downer conversation and the</text>
  <text start="152.23" dur="4.05">July 3rd probe we have learned we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="154.54" dur="3.51">learned that it wasn&amp;#39;t Australian</text>
  <text start="156.28" dur="4.53">intelligence that passed along the info</text>
  <text start="158.05" dur="4.86">but mr. downer personally to State</text>
  <text start="160.81" dur="4.259">Department personal personnel and</text>
  <text start="162.91" dur="4.46">violation of procedure and a growing</text>
  <text start="165.069" dur="4.621">list of Trump officials now relate</text>
  <text start="167.37" dur="4.93">moments when they were approached by</text>
  <text start="169.69" dur="5.37">suspicious figures before July 31st</text>
  <text start="172.3" dur="5.31">that&amp;#39;s why congressional investigators</text>
  <text start="175.06" dur="5.64">have come to suspect the real origin</text>
  <text start="177.61" dur="5.43">story is very different they believe the</text>
  <text start="180.7" dur="5.28">FBI was investigating Trump officials</text>
  <text start="183.04" dur="4.37">well before July 31st on the basis of</text>
  <text start="185.98" dur="3.11">the dossier and</text>
  <text start="187.41" dur="5.07">is information from the State Department</text>
  <text start="189.09" dur="5.18">officials they think the bureau was</text>
  <text start="192.48" dur="5.04">employing a variety of</text>
  <text start="194.27" dur="4.45">counterintelligence tools before there</text>
  <text start="197.52" dur="3.51">was an official counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="198.72" dur="4.56">probe and that this included deploying</text>
  <text start="201.03" dur="5.1">spies against political actors they</text>
  <text start="203.28" dur="5.43">suspect that only when the FBI decided</text>
  <text start="206.13" dur="5.91">that it wanted to obtain a FISA warrant</text>
  <text start="208.71" dur="5.28">against Trump aide Carter page did it</text>
  <text start="212.04" dur="5.01">service the downer information and make</text>
  <text start="213.99" dur="6.9">it the official pretext in July now</text>
  <text start="217.05" dur="7.28">remember to order the FISA warrant</text>
  <text start="220.89" dur="6.42">it requires an official investigation</text>
  <text start="224.33" dur="5.91">but was there really an official in</text>
  <text start="227.31" dur="7.14">Suffolk an investigation most likely not</text>
  <text start="230.24" dur="7.18">so Trump has an even quicker way to</text>
  <text start="234.45" dur="5.19">bring the truth out and we know that Q</text>
  <text start="237.42" dur="4.5">has mentioned this many times where he</text>
  <text start="239.64" dur="5.4">would like Congress to ask him to</text>
  <text start="241.92" dur="6.78">declassify all the information but Trump</text>
  <text start="245.04" dur="7.08">also can force the situation and Q has</text>
  <text start="248.7" dur="5.64">mentioned that the issue might need to</text>
  <text start="252.12" dur="6.54">be forced where Trump goes ahead and D</text>
  <text start="254.34" dur="8.19">classifies all the information so if</text>
  <text start="258.66" dur="5.7">this does happen and most likely the</text>
  <text start="262.53" dur="3.72">news will come out later today</text>
  <text start="264.36" dur="5.309">very late maybe there&amp;#39;ll be another</text>
  <text start="266.25" dur="4.62">story to hide this news and the</text>
  <text start="269.669" dur="3.061">corporate media the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="270.87" dur="3.54">will keep some other news in the new</text>
  <text start="272.73" dur="4.439">cycle or maybe they even maybe they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="274.41" dur="5.07">even push an event to try to cover all</text>
  <text start="277.169" dur="7.441">of this up if this does comes out later</text>
  <text start="279.48" dur="6.689">today and we know that they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="284.61" dur="4.62">any of this coming out into the open and</text>
  <text start="286.169" dur="5.761">if Trump does declassify I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="289.23" dur="5.82">about the IG report it&amp;#39;s game over for</text>
  <text start="291.93" dur="5.01">the deep state and they know this so</text>
  <text start="295.05" dur="5.3">we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see how this all</text>
  <text start="296.94" dur="6.81">plays out but this is the next step and</text>
  <text start="300.35" dur="8.29">we&amp;#39;ll see if something happens later on</text>
  <text start="303.75" dur="7.32">this evening now in North Korea we see</text>
  <text start="308.64" dur="5.04">North Korea&amp;#39;s looking for a venue in</text>
  <text start="311.07" dur="5.04">Switzerland for a possible second summit</text>
  <text start="313.68" dur="5.34">between Kim jong-un and Donald and</text>
  <text start="316.11" dur="5.19">president Trump we see the Korean</text>
  <text start="319.02" dur="4.649">diplomats they&amp;#39;ve been sent to burn</text>
  <text start="321.3" dur="3.81">Davos and Geneva to obtain first-hand</text>
  <text start="323.669" dur="4.021">information about international</text>
  <text start="325.11" dur="4.5">conference halls and hotels and it looks</text>
  <text start="327.69" dur="5.789">like there&amp;#39;s another summit headed our</text>
  <text start="329.61" dur="6.48">way we see in South Korea people in</text>
  <text start="333.479" dur="5.19">South Korea they don&amp;#39;t want nukes the</text>
  <text start="336.09" dur="4.59">fad missile system in their country and</text>
  <text start="338.669" dur="4.261">they&amp;#39;re very angry about this saying we</text>
  <text start="340.68" dur="4.62">do have peace right now and there is no</text>
  <text start="342.93" dur="5.94">reason to keep these missiles in the</text>
  <text start="345.3" dur="5.549">country so president moon he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="348.87" dur="4.47">have to look at this situation and maybe</text>
  <text start="350.849" dur="3.841">remove the THAAD missile systems and he</text>
  <text start="353.34" dur="3.479">did when he first came into office</text>
  <text start="354.69" dur="3.629">looked into this and said whoa we never</text>
  <text start="356.819" dur="3.69">even approved some of these things and</text>
  <text start="358.319" dur="3.6">he wanted them taken out but it looks</text>
  <text start="360.509" dur="3.571">like the deep State convinced him to</text>
  <text start="361.919" dur="4.47">keep him there but at this point it</text>
  <text start="364.08" dur="4.26">looks like he has the ability to say you</text>
  <text start="366.389" dur="5.131">know something there&amp;#39;s no reason to keep</text>
  <text start="368.34" dur="6.449">the THAAD system in the country we see</text>
  <text start="371.52" dur="6.09">Iran they are still pushing their agenda</text>
  <text start="374.789" dur="5.85">by getting Europe and other nations to</text>
  <text start="377.61" dur="5.309">agree to their nuclear deal since the</text>
  <text start="380.639" dur="4.141">u.s. dropped out of it France says</text>
  <text start="382.919" dur="3.631">Europe is unlikely to put together an</text>
  <text start="384.78" dur="5.129">economic package for Iran before</text>
  <text start="386.55" dur="5.19">November and turan is urging them that</text>
  <text start="389.909" dur="4.741">they need something now they need</text>
  <text start="391.74" dur="4.679">promises they need assurances they need</text>
  <text start="394.65" dur="3.72">to know that they&amp;#39;re going to fund the</text>
  <text start="396.419" dur="4.891">operations that the state was funding</text>
  <text start="398.37" dur="5.19">when the US was in the deal and this was</text>
  <text start="401.31" dur="5.34">about siphoning money money laundering</text>
  <text start="403.56" dur="5.669">and all this money was covertly used to</text>
  <text start="406.65" dur="5.94">create some type of nuclear weapon to</text>
  <text start="409.229" dur="5.55">blame the maybe an explosion or</text>
  <text start="412.59" dur="6.74">something to blame it on Russia to bring</text>
  <text start="414.779" dur="9.061">us to war so we see right now that</text>
  <text start="419.33" dur="6.309">Iran&amp;#39;s president rouhani told German</text>
  <text start="423.84" dur="4.079">Chancellor Angela Merkel over the phone</text>
  <text start="425.639" dur="4.77">that Tehran would continue cooperation</text>
  <text start="427.919" dur="6.68">with Europe if the remaining parties to</text>
  <text start="430.409" dur="7.081">the jcpoa meet Torrens expectations</text>
  <text start="434.599" dur="4.78">Germany&amp;#39;s foreign minister Kiko Maas</text>
  <text start="437.49" dur="3.75">said on Friday that the Europeans will</text>
  <text start="439.379" dur="4.35">not be able to fully compensate for</text>
  <text start="441.24" dur="5.549">companies leaving Iran due to new US</text>
  <text start="443.729" dur="5.761">sanctions so they&amp;#39;re in a tough vine</text>
  <text start="446.789" dur="6.6">right now and Europe might not be able</text>
  <text start="449.49" dur="5.25">to pay out what Iran needs and this</text>
  <text start="453.389" dur="5.221">whole thing might go down the toy</text>
  <text start="454.74" dur="6.299">here we see that the UN for the last</text>
  <text start="458.61" dur="5.76">couple of weeks since Russia&amp;#39;s in there</text>
  <text start="461.039" dur="5.731">since Syria&amp;#39;s in there since they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="464.37" dur="4.41">removing the paid mercenary armies the</text>
  <text start="466.77" dur="4.89">Islamic state i&amp;#39;ll destroy al qaeda and</text>
  <text start="468.78" dur="4.83">the rest the UN is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="471.66" dur="4.86">claiming that there&amp;#39;s a high internal</text>
  <text start="473.61" dur="4.86">refugee number in the southwest of syria</text>
  <text start="476.52" dur="5.7">due to recent fighting in the gara</text>
  <text start="478.47" dur="5.849">government and when we review some of</text>
  <text start="482.22" dur="4.47">this evidence it shows that these</text>
  <text start="484.319" dur="5.13">numbers are implausible it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="486.69" dur="5.37">impossible in what the UN is reporting</text>
  <text start="489.449" dur="4.741">so over the last two weeks the long</text>
  <text start="492.06" dur="3.96">announced operation of the Syrian army</text>
  <text start="494.19" dur="3.509">and its allies to liberate the southwest</text>
  <text start="496.02" dur="5.429">Syria from terrorist organizations and</text>
  <text start="497.699" dur="6.03">rebels proceeded very well they went</text>
  <text start="501.449" dur="4.231">into the area and they started to</text>
  <text start="503.729" dur="6.451">capture and liberate all these different</text>
  <text start="505.68" dur="5.82">areas the UN came out and they started</text>
  <text start="510.18" dur="3.419">to report that there are so many</text>
  <text start="511.5" dur="5.01">refugees so many people injured so many</text>
  <text start="513.599" dur="5.57">people are getting hurt and a lot of</text>
  <text start="516.51" dur="6.24">this information doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="519.169" dur="6.641">because when we start to look at this we</text>
  <text start="522.75" dur="4.709">see the following many of the areas in</text>
  <text start="525.81" dur="3.87">the southwest Syria they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="527.459" dur="2.701">recovered without much serious fighting</text>
  <text start="529.68" dur="2.399">at all</text>
  <text start="530.16" dur="3.929">many of the paid mercenaries the</text>
  <text start="532.079" dur="3.781">moderate rebels and the rest handed over</text>
  <text start="534.089" dur="4.201">their weapons they&amp;#39;re in talks with</text>
  <text start="535.86" dur="4.8">Russia and Syria and there&amp;#39;s really been</text>
  <text start="538.29" dur="3.87">no fighting whatsoever actually a lot of</text>
  <text start="540.66" dur="4.169">them have been changing sides and</text>
  <text start="542.16" dur="5.28">joining the Syrian army and many of them</text>
  <text start="544.829" dur="5.311">have been trying to work out deals there</text>
  <text start="547.44" dur="4.769">are still attempts by the usual suspects</text>
  <text start="550.14" dur="5.79">to involve the u.s. into the fight by</text>
  <text start="552.209" dur="5.581">warning of the Iranian boogeyman on the</text>
  <text start="555.93" dur="4.56">border of Israel and we&amp;#39;re going to get</text>
  <text start="557.79" dur="4.799">into that in a little bit about what is</text>
  <text start="560.49" dur="5.19">coming and what is being planned behind</text>
  <text start="562.589" dur="6">closed doors but as we know there really</text>
  <text start="565.68" dur="5.61">are no Iranian units in southwest Syria</text>
  <text start="568.589" dur="6.481">it&amp;#39;s the Syrian army and the Russian</text>
  <text start="571.29" dur="6.51">forces other propaganda outlets raised</text>
  <text start="575.07" dur="4.44">the claim plight of refugees in the area</text>
  <text start="577.8" dur="4.17">but it&amp;#39;s not clear where those refugees</text>
  <text start="579.51" dur="4.68">are supposed to come from the now</text>
  <text start="581.97" dur="5.01">cleared eastern part of Dera government</text>
  <text start="584.19" dur="3.69">was taken via reconciliation agreements</text>
  <text start="586.98" dur="2.91">with well</text>
  <text start="587.88" dur="5.07">Tivoli little fighting civilians stayed</text>
  <text start="589.89" dur="5.13">in place or have since returned Syria is</text>
  <text start="592.95" dur="5.28">saying they want everyone to return to</text>
  <text start="595.02" dur="6.69">these liberated areas that were out a</text>
  <text start="598.23" dur="5.52">long time ago so the UN came out and</text>
  <text start="601.71" dur="4.65">they said there was about 270,000</text>
  <text start="603.75" dur="6.09">displaced by the violence and the</text>
  <text start="606.36" dur="5.76">fighting in the south of Syria there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="609.84" dur="5.16">no source for the claim number of</text>
  <text start="612.12" dur="4.47">refugees that was given a report by the</text>
  <text start="615" dur="6.29">UN office for the Coordination of</text>
  <text start="616.59" dur="6.69">Humanitarian Affairs the och a published</text>
  <text start="621.29" dur="4.9">around three hundred twenty five</text>
  <text start="623.28" dur="4.89">thousand people were displaced and where</text>
  <text start="626.19" dur="5.39">are those numbers coming from the UN</text>
  <text start="628.17" dur="6.66">report does not explain how when or why</text>
  <text start="631.58" dur="5.89">these people supposedly moved the few</text>
  <text start="634.83" dur="5.34">miles towards the Israel occupied Golan</text>
  <text start="637.47" dur="5.76">Heights there is no evidence that this</text>
  <text start="640.17" dur="6.69">claim movement of IDPs who may or may</text>
  <text start="643.23" dur="5.34">not exist happen at all the UN is just</text>
  <text start="646.86" dur="4.14">out there reporting information I think</text>
  <text start="648.57" dur="4.77">this is part of the deep state trying to</text>
  <text start="651" dur="5.01">convince everyone there&amp;#39;s a huge problem</text>
  <text start="653.34" dur="4.05">there and they want the u.s. to get</text>
  <text start="656.01" dur="2.91">involved and I think this is what the</text>
  <text start="657.39" dur="4.5">deep state is continually trying to do</text>
  <text start="658.92" dur="7.08">we see Russia and the Free Syrian Army</text>
  <text start="661.89" dur="6.99">they&amp;#39;ve reached a deal on an agreement</text>
  <text start="666" dur="4.98">in southern Syria under the agreement</text>
  <text start="668.88" dur="4.47">the FSA will hand over its weapons to</text>
  <text start="670.98" dur="4.29">the Syrian Arab army and withdraw to the</text>
  <text start="673.35" dur="3.99">opposition-held areas and by the way the</text>
  <text start="675.27" dur="4.83">Free Syrian Army is the paid mercenary</text>
  <text start="677.34" dur="3.69">army of the deep state they give them</text>
  <text start="680.1" dur="3.81">all different names the Syrian</text>
  <text start="681.03" dur="4.41">Democratic army the Free Syrian Army the</text>
  <text start="683.91" dur="3.48">moderate rebels it&amp;#39;s all one in the same</text>
  <text start="685.44" dur="3.33">we just call them paid mercenaries same</text>
  <text start="687.39" dur="3.69">thing with the terrorists are all one in</text>
  <text start="688.77" dur="4.92">the same and they&amp;#39;re gonna hand over all</text>
  <text start="691.08" dur="4.41">the weapons in the Syrian army well</text>
  <text start="693.69" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re gonna take over all these areas</text>
  <text start="695.49" dur="4.59">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="697.56" dur="5.49">Syrian army they have seized more points</text>
  <text start="700.08" dur="6.39">along the Jordanian border and now the</text>
  <text start="703.05" dur="6.78">Syrian army controls around 72% of the</text>
  <text start="706.47" dur="6.78">Southwest Syria area</text>
  <text start="709.83" dur="6.06">the paid mercenary forces only control</text>
  <text start="713.25" dur="6.149">around 28% and that number is dwindling</text>
  <text start="715.89" dur="5.759">very very fast now the OPCW they came</text>
  <text start="719.399" dur="4.411">out with their preliminary report and</text>
  <text start="721.649" dur="4.771">the OPCW is the organization for the</text>
  <text start="723.81" dur="4.32">prohibition of chemical weapons and they</text>
  <text start="726.42" dur="5.82">announced in the report that they found</text>
  <text start="728.13" dur="7.68">there was no nerve agents used in the</text>
  <text start="732.24" dur="7.26">city of Douma in that area whatsoever so</text>
  <text start="735.81" dur="6.63">the OPCW experts they said they found</text>
  <text start="739.5" dur="6.3">traces of organic substances containing</text>
  <text start="742.44" dur="6.63">chlorine which allegedly was used in the</text>
  <text start="745.8" dur="6.45">attack in duma along with explosive</text>
  <text start="749.07" dur="4.86">residues various chlorinated organic</text>
  <text start="752.25" dur="4.74">chemicals were found in samples from two</text>
  <text start="753.93" dur="7.589">sites for which there is a full Chain of</text>
  <text start="756.99" dur="6.33">Custody now the gas attack in duma as we</text>
  <text start="761.519" dur="4.411">know was filmed by the white helmets</text>
  <text start="763.32" dur="6.78">last april they said sarin gas was used</text>
  <text start="765.93" dur="5.88">and they filmed and orchestrated the</text>
  <text start="770.1" dur="3.15">entire thing we know there were</text>
  <text start="771.81" dur="3.839">reporters there we know there were many</text>
  <text start="773.25" dur="4.529">other individuals there saying that yet</text>
  <text start="775.649" dur="6.38">there was really no one that was ill and</text>
  <text start="777.779" dur="7.381">the whole thing was a staged event and</text>
  <text start="782.029" dur="4.481">right now the OPCW is saying and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="785.16" dur="3.36">done this on-site it wasn&amp;#39;t through</text>
  <text start="786.51" dur="3.87">social media or things like that that</text>
  <text start="788.52" dur="4.319">they really can&amp;#39;t find any evidence</text>
  <text start="790.38" dur="4.26">whatsoever that a nerve agent was used</text>
  <text start="792.839" dur="5.041">and it looks like those stories are</text>
  <text start="794.64" dur="7.4">coming true we see behind closed doors</text>
  <text start="797.88" dur="9.06">there are meetings top decision makers</text>
  <text start="802.04" dur="8.26">working together to remove the US troops</text>
  <text start="806.94" dur="4.97">from the AL tamp area now let&amp;#39;s think</text>
  <text start="810.3" dur="6.21">about what has happened here</text>
  <text start="811.91" dur="6.85">we know that trump has stopped the</text>
  <text start="816.51" dur="4.86">funding to the Kurds Trump has stopped</text>
  <text start="818.76" dur="4.76">the funding to the moderate rebels stop</text>
  <text start="821.37" dur="4.44">the training programs actually</text>
  <text start="823.52" dur="4.569">redirected the Pentagon and said go</text>
  <text start="825.81" dur="4.26">after the Islamic state prior to that we</text>
  <text start="828.089" dur="4.711">know that Obama was picking the targets</text>
  <text start="830.07" dur="4.709">and the Islamic state was gaining ground</text>
  <text start="832.8" dur="4.71">and capturing more and more towns</text>
  <text start="834.779" dur="5.091">because the air force at that time</text>
  <text start="837.51" dur="4.19">directed by Obama they were bombing</text>
  <text start="839.87" dur="4.65">Syrian</text>
  <text start="841.7" dur="5.19">targets to allow the Islamic state to</text>
  <text start="844.52" dur="5.4">move forward we know from reports on the</text>
  <text start="846.89" dur="5.4">ground the people were tortured they</text>
  <text start="849.92" dur="4.77">were they feared for their lives while</text>
  <text start="852.29" dur="4.86">the paid mercenaries the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="854.69" dur="5.3">al nusra al Qaeda the rest were in these</text>
  <text start="857.15" dur="5.9">towns and they controlled the towns so</text>
  <text start="859.99" dur="5.02">what is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right here is</text>
  <text start="863.05" dur="7">everything is starting to turn around</text>
  <text start="865.01" dur="8.13">now so what Trump likes to do is he</text>
  <text start="870.05" dur="5.16">never Telegraph&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s going to do</text>
  <text start="873.14" dur="5.87">he tries to make it seem like everything</text>
  <text start="875.21" dur="6.69">is exactly what the deep state wants and</text>
  <text start="879.01" dur="5.26">what has been happening here is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="881.9" dur="4.95">using the same story that Obama used the</text>
  <text start="884.27" dur="4.47">u.s. is going after it the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="886.85" dur="4.98">but the u.s. is really going everything</text>
  <text start="888.74" dur="5.46">the Islamic state and the u.s. is in</text>
  <text start="891.83" dur="5.1">Syria to destroy terrorism which is the</text>
  <text start="894.2" dur="4.53">Islamic state al Qaeda al nusra well</text>
  <text start="896.93" dur="6.12">when Obama said it that wasn&amp;#39;t the case</text>
  <text start="898.73" dur="7.32">the case was to remove Assad now the</text>
  <text start="903.05" dur="5.07">cases to remove the Islamic state the</text>
  <text start="906.05" dur="6.99">paid mercenaries the moderate rebels al</text>
  <text start="908.12" dur="10.56">nusra al Qaeda and the rest so Trump has</text>
  <text start="913.04" dur="8.58">been using this narrative and trying to</text>
  <text start="918.68" dur="7.17">figure out a way to get the US troops</text>
  <text start="921.62" dur="8.91">out of Syria and it looks like they came</text>
  <text start="925.85" dur="7.35">up with a plan with Putin Putin put it</text>
  <text start="930.53" dur="6.57">out there that they want all foreign</text>
  <text start="933.2" dur="7.31">troops to leave Syria that&amp;#39;s including a</text>
  <text start="937.1" dur="7.65">ramp this was done on purpose Trump and</text>
  <text start="940.51" dur="7.3">Israel they&amp;#39;re using the Iranian story</text>
  <text start="944.75" dur="5.46">as a cover where they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="947.81" dur="3.96">Iran their armed forces they&amp;#39;re at the</text>
  <text start="950.21" dur="4.02">border with the coal at the Golan</text>
  <text start="951.77" dur="4.95">Heights and they need to remove</text>
  <text start="954.23" dur="5.01">themselves and we only want the Syrian</text>
  <text start="956.72" dur="5.13">army there we want Syria to agree to the</text>
  <text start="959.24" dur="4.08">1974 agreement where there&amp;#39;s no heavy</text>
  <text start="961.85" dur="4.32">weapons or things like that and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="963.32" dur="4.38">a buffer zone there using the Iranian</text>
  <text start="966.17" dur="5.49">story that there&amp;#39;s actual troops in</text>
  <text start="967.7" dur="6">there to allow the u.s. to pull out of</text>
  <text start="971.66" dur="3.6">there and Israel to pull out at the same</text>
  <text start="973.7" dur="3.15">time</text>
  <text start="975.26" dur="3.78">this is why Netanyahu has been meeting</text>
  <text start="976.85" dur="5.49">with Putin this is why Trump is going to</text>
  <text start="979.04" dur="6.12">meet with Putin and once this happens</text>
  <text start="982.34" dur="6.75">you&amp;#39;re going to see everything change</text>
  <text start="985.16" dur="7.11">and you&amp;#39;re going to see there will be an</text>
  <text start="989.09" dur="6.57">announcement where the troops in Al tamp</text>
  <text start="992.27" dur="6.24">because remember the Syrian army</text>
  <text start="995.66" dur="5.97">controls 72 percent of the South right</text>
  <text start="998.51" dur="6.45">now they&amp;#39;re closing in on the al town</text>
  <text start="1001.63" dur="4.17">base the deep state would like an</text>
  <text start="1004.96" dur="3.57">all-out war</text>
  <text start="1005.8" dur="4.14">and they&amp;#39;re gonna try probably maybe one</text>
  <text start="1008.53" dur="3.96">more time they&amp;#39;re gonna try to do</text>
  <text start="1009.94" dur="4.83">something but it will fail so when Trump</text>
  <text start="1012.49" dur="2.99">and Putin meet and they put this whole</text>
  <text start="1014.77" dur="3.45">thing together</text>
  <text start="1015.48" dur="5.38">most likely Putin or Saud they will</text>
  <text start="1018.22" dur="4.95">announce or maybe together that they are</text>
  <text start="1020.86" dur="5.03">recalling the Iranian troops they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1023.17" dur="7.44">gonna be pulling out of that area and</text>
  <text start="1025.89" dur="8.02">this will be the beginning stages of the</text>
  <text start="1030.61" dur="6.66">pull out of the US troops from this area</text>
  <text start="1033.91" dur="7.11">and the Syrian army will then take over</text>
  <text start="1037.27" dur="5.97">this entire area with Russia in the</text>
  <text start="1041.02" dur="4.98">background and I believe this is all</text>
  <text start="1043.24" dur="5.64">being set up right now but before this</text>
  <text start="1046" dur="4.44">happens we know that Trump and Putin are</text>
  <text start="1048.88" dur="4.68">going to meet and what is the deep state</text>
  <text start="1050.44" dur="6.36">going to do they&amp;#39;re going to try to stop</text>
  <text start="1053.56" dur="7.35">this meeting at all costs so what that</text>
  <text start="1056.8" dur="6.21">means is they will create news that</text>
  <text start="1060.91" dur="5.31">might say that Russia is being</text>
  <text start="1063.01" dur="6.51">aggressive Russia is flying bombers</text>
  <text start="1066.22" dur="5.13">Russia is very close to something else</text>
  <text start="1069.52" dur="4.26">or maybe they&amp;#39;ll make up any you know</text>
  <text start="1071.35" dur="3.99">any type of an event or something or</text>
  <text start="1073.78" dur="3.75">maybe they&amp;#39;ll show that Russia tried to</text>
  <text start="1075.34" dur="3.93">poison someone I mean who knows what</text>
  <text start="1077.53" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s going to be but whatever they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1079.27" dur="3.81">going to do they&amp;#39;re gonna try to stop</text>
  <text start="1080.95" dur="5.55">this meaning they don&amp;#39;t want it to</text>
  <text start="1083.08" dur="5.67">happen once it happens it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1086.5" dur="4.92">game over for the deep state they know</text>
  <text start="1088.75" dur="6.15">this so we have what&amp;#39;s happening with</text>
  <text start="1091.42" dur="5.61">the deep state with Comey Clinton stroke</text>
  <text start="1094.9" dur="4.77">all the indictments we have what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1097.03" dur="4.47">happening with Trump and Putin meeting</text>
  <text start="1099.67" dur="3.63">with everything falling apart in the</text>
  <text start="1101.5" dur="4.62">Middle East and when you look around you</text>
  <text start="1103.3" dur="4.87">can see everything is falling apart all</text>
  <text start="1106.12" dur="5.23">at once</text>
  <text start="1108.17" dur="6.27">and we have to go back to Q where he</text>
  <text start="1111.35" dur="5.4">says November 11th is a very important</text>
  <text start="1114.44" dur="3.33">date and I do believe this is when</text>
  <text start="1116.75" dur="3.09">troops</text>
  <text start="1117.77" dur="4.289">I mean before this time troops will be</text>
  <text start="1119.84" dur="5.88">coming out of the Middle East they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="1122.059" dur="5.431">coming home and I think the parade is</text>
  <text start="1125.72" dur="3.48">going to be the parade of all parades</text>
  <text start="1127.49" dur="5.7">and I think this is all being set up to</text>
  <text start="1129.2" dur="6.479">happen prior to November 11th and then</text>
  <text start="1133.19" dur="5.489">they&amp;#39;ll have the parade on over November</text>
  <text start="1135.679" dur="5.49">11th to say that we no longer need to be</text>
  <text start="1138.679" dur="4.591">in Syria most likely we know the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="1141.169" dur="3.871">government wants US troops out of there</text>
  <text start="1143.27" dur="4.5">so we&amp;#39;ll probably see troops being</text>
  <text start="1145.04" dur="5.7">pulled out of Iraq remember the number</text>
  <text start="1147.77" dur="5.19">of troops in these countries is a lot</text>
  <text start="1150.74" dur="4.11">more than everyone thinks because what</text>
  <text start="1152.96" dur="4.02">they did was under the agreement with</text>
  <text start="1154.85" dur="4.05">Iraq they are allowed you know something</text>
  <text start="1156.98" dur="5.939">like six thousand or so plus troops in</text>
  <text start="1158.9" dur="8.01">there but in the agreement they can have</text>
  <text start="1162.919" dur="5.76">temporary troops temporary troops don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1166.91" dur="5.58">have an expiration date and all they do</text>
  <text start="1168.679" dur="6.24">is rotate them so they can have 20,000</text>
  <text start="1172.49" dur="4.17">temporary troops in there and all I have</text>
  <text start="1174.919" dur="4.021">to do is say no though they&amp;#39;re temporary</text>
  <text start="1176.66" dur="3.81">they don&amp;#39;t count as the full-time troops</text>
  <text start="1178.94" dur="4.05">and this is what they&amp;#39;ve done in the</text>
  <text start="1180.47" dur="5.88">past and we know that these temporary</text>
  <text start="1182.99" dur="6.78">troops move into Syria from Iraq into</text>
  <text start="1186.35" dur="5.52">Syria so once again we&amp;#39;re gonna see a</text>
  <text start="1189.77" dur="3.3">lot of troops come home a lot of troops</text>
  <text start="1191.87" dur="3.27">that we didn&amp;#39;t even know we had out</text>
  <text start="1193.07" dur="4.229">there and all this has been hidden for a</text>
  <text start="1195.14" dur="4.94">very long time and I think this whole</text>
  <text start="1197.299" dur="6.571">narrative is being created to show that</text>
  <text start="1200.08" dur="5.589">we&amp;#39;ve beaten the Islamic state even</text>
  <text start="1203.87" dur="4.02">though it was created by the intelligent</text>
  <text start="1205.669" dur="4.711">agencies and Obama they controlled it we</text>
  <text start="1207.89" dur="5.13">beat the Islamic state Iran pulled out</text>
  <text start="1210.38" dur="5.31">and now it&amp;#39;s time for the u.s. to leave</text>
  <text start="1213.02" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re gonna make it look like the US</text>
  <text start="1215.69" dur="4.4">was very successful in this area and</text>
  <text start="1218.15" dur="5.279">they&amp;#39;re going to bring the troops home</text>
  <text start="1220.09" dur="5.62">so we can see the plan is moving forward</text>
  <text start="1223.429" dur="4.141">we see that all the pieces are starting</text>
  <text start="1225.71" dur="3.81">to come together right now the deep</text>
  <text start="1227.57" dur="4.95">state they are floundering right now</text>
  <text start="1229.52" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re in big big trouble and they</text>
  <text start="1232.52" dur="4.92">might try some type of an event they</text>
  <text start="1235.61" dur="4.59">might stick something in the new cycle</text>
  <text start="1237.44" dur="4.38">that gets everyone&amp;#39;s emotions all riled</text>
  <text start="1240.2" dur="3.3">up they might try so</text>
  <text start="1241.82" dur="2.97">type of civil war even though that cue</text>
  <text start="1243.5" dur="3.96">said there&amp;#39;s going to be no civil war</text>
  <text start="1244.79" dur="4.62">they might try to launch something where</text>
  <text start="1247.46" dur="3.81">it they try to get it off the ground but</text>
