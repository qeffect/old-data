  <text start="93.31" dur="3.18">Trump is trying to do here and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="95.289" dur="3.96">talking about Trump of the Patriots</text>
  <text start="96.49" dur="6.119">where they&amp;#39;re going to restructure the</text>
  <text start="99.249" dur="7.14">Federal Reserve and change what we know</text>
  <text start="102.609" dur="8.161">today about the economy and they can see</text>
  <text start="106.389" dur="7.86">that he is pushing this agenda the</text>
  <text start="110.77" dur="6.72">Patriots are pushing the economic plan</text>
  <text start="114.249" dur="6.12">forward and it is succeeding but before</text>
  <text start="117.49" dur="5.759">we get there Trump in the Patriots</text>
  <text start="120.369" dur="6.06">know that if we or when we make this</text>
  <text start="123.249" dur="6.48">transition there are those that are</text>
  <text start="126.429" dur="4.881">dependent on the government well they</text>
  <text start="129.729" dur="4.861">can&amp;#39;t be dependent on the government and</text>
  <text start="131.31" dur="6.64">this is why Trump has been pushing jobs</text>
  <text start="134.59" dur="6.24">jobs jobs yes it&amp;#39;s for the transition</text>
  <text start="137.95" dur="5.369">but it&amp;#39;s also to get those individuals</text>
  <text start="140.83" dur="6.32">that are dependent on the government off</text>
  <text start="143.319" dur="7.021">of a lot of the entitlement programs and</text>
  <text start="147.15" dur="4.96">what we are seeing is that it is working</text>
  <text start="150.34" dur="3.54">because the less people that are</text>
  <text start="152.11" dur="3.06">dependent on the government the</text>
  <text start="153.88" dur="3.23">transition will be that much easier</text>
  <text start="155.17" dur="5.76">remember during the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="157.11" dur="5.86">there were a lot of people on food</text>
  <text start="160.93" dur="3.54">stamps dependent on the government</text>
  <text start="162.97" dur="4.38">this was their whole entire</text>
  <text start="164.47" dur="6.3">err plan Trump again with the Patriots</text>
  <text start="167.35" dur="4.95">they are reversing all of this and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="170.77" dur="3.33">getting words that the number of</text>
  <text start="172.3" dur="4.17">individuals participating in the</text>
  <text start="174.1" dur="7.74">nation&amp;#39;s food stamp program has sunk to</text>
  <text start="176.47" dur="8.6">its lowest level in ten years now if we</text>
  <text start="181.84" dur="8.28">go back ten years ago and in July 2009</text>
  <text start="185.07" dur="7.99">which was six months into former Barack</text>
  <text start="190.12" dur="6.33">Obama&amp;#39;s first full year in office 35</text>
  <text start="193.06" dur="8.58">million individuals remained on the food</text>
  <text start="196.45" dur="8.25">stamp program and in 2013 it hit an</text>
  <text start="201.64" dur="5.88">all-time high when Trump came into</text>
  <text start="204.7" dur="4.68">office around 2.9 million individuals</text>
  <text start="207.52" dur="3.84">dropped out of the supplemental</text>
  <text start="209.38" dur="5.13">nutritional assistant program which is</text>
  <text start="211.36" dur="4.47">snap food stamps now of course they said</text>
  <text start="214.51" dur="3.6">well this is because the government shut</text>
  <text start="215.83" dur="4.92">down and these aren&amp;#39;t numbers are not</text>
  <text start="218.11" dur="7.02">correct but when we look at the chart</text>
  <text start="220.75" dur="8.61">that was just produced we see a decline</text>
  <text start="225.13" dur="7.29">in the number of people that are on food</text>
  <text start="229.36" dur="5.79">stamps if we go back to the Year 2016 we</text>
  <text start="232.42" dur="7.08">have the number of households around 21</text>
  <text start="235.15" dur="7.74">million if we go to 2017 20 million if</text>
  <text start="239.5" dur="5.76">we go to 2018 19 million if we go to</text>
  <text start="242.89" dur="5.67">2019 60 million the same thing with</text>
  <text start="245.26" dur="6.449">persons if we go back to 2016 there were</text>
  <text start="248.56" dur="8.64">44 million people on food stamps go to</text>
  <text start="251.709" dur="9.121">2017 42 and 39 33 in 2019 so you can see</text>
  <text start="257.2" dur="6.719">the trajectory is headed downward it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="260.83" dur="5.1">in a decline and Trump has signaled that</text>
  <text start="263.919" dur="4.351">he wants to curb the nation&amp;#39;s dependency</text>
  <text start="265.93" dur="5.7">on food stamps and wants those coming to</text>
  <text start="268.27" dur="6.149">this country to be self-sufficient hmm I</text>
  <text start="271.63" dur="4.8">wonder why he wants that now very</text>
  <text start="274.419" dur="4.231">interestingly we know that Trump is</text>
  <text start="276.43" dur="3.69">beginning a lot of people jobs remember</text>
  <text start="278.65" dur="4.41">this is all in preparation for the</text>
  <text start="280.12" dur="4.62">transition and also these individuals</text>
  <text start="283.06" dur="4.44">like Trump said they need to be</text>
  <text start="284.74" dur="5.01">independent because when the transition</text>
  <text start="287.5" dur="4.02">comes they cannot be dependent on the</text>
  <text start="289.75" dur="4.74">government the government is going to</text>
  <text start="291.52" dur="5.26">have their own problems now Don jr.</text>
  <text start="294.49" dur="5.08">tweeted out something very interesting</text>
  <text start="296.78" dur="4.62">remember when at real Donald Trump asked</text>
  <text start="299.57" dur="4.59">minority voters for a chance to deliver</text>
  <text start="301.4" dur="5.27">for them after they&amp;#39;ve been ignored and</text>
  <text start="304.16" dur="5.48">taken for granted by Dems</text>
  <text start="306.67" dur="5.41">what do you have to lose he said well</text>
  <text start="309.64" dur="4.84">minorities account for more than half of</text>
  <text start="312.08" dur="5.88">all new jobs created during the Trump</text>
  <text start="314.48" dur="5.4">presidency and under this it says nearly</text>
  <text start="317.96" dur="4.47">1 million more blacks and 2 million more</text>
  <text start="319.88" dur="4.47">Hispanics are employed than one Obama</text>
  <text start="322.43" dur="4.08">left office a minorities account for</text>
  <text start="324.35" dur="4.86">more than half of all new jobs creating</text>
  <text start="326.51" dur="4.68">during the trump presidency unemployment</text>
  <text start="329.21" dur="3.81">among black women has hovered near five</text>
  <text start="331.19" dur="4.56">percent for the last six months the</text>
  <text start="333.02" dur="4.71">lowest since 1972 and a mere three point</text>
  <text start="335.75" dur="6.36">five percent of high school graduates</text>
  <text start="337.73" dur="7.8">are unemployed so you can see Trump is</text>
  <text start="342.11" dur="8.309">taking these individuals and taking them</text>
  <text start="345.53" dur="8.49">off the government programs this is all</text>
  <text start="350.419" dur="5.671">being done on purpose because Trump and</text>
  <text start="354.02" dur="4.38">the Patriots they&amp;#39;re preparing for this</text>
  <text start="356.09" dur="5.01">major major transition and everything is</text>
  <text start="358.4" dur="3.51">being set up and everything is being put</text>
  <text start="361.1" dur="2.43">into motion</text>
  <text start="361.91" dur="3.48">now the mainstream media the deep sate</text>

  <text start="445.129" dur="5.22">they need to do they need to go to the</text>
  <text start="448.159" dur="4.591">source of the problem and that is the</text>
  <text start="450.349" dur="5.701">central bank the central bank creates</text>
  <text start="452.75" dur="5.72">currency which the deep state the</text>

  <text start="484.849" dur="3.87">what do they do</text>
  <text start="485.93" dur="5.579">they hit the source Trump joined in</text>
  <text start="488.719" dur="5.371">later and hid the source when the source</text>
  <text start="491.509" dur="5.28">was removed what happened to the paid</text>
  <text start="494.09" dur="5.19">mercenary army it completely fell apart</text>
  <text start="496.789" dur="5.37">Trump and the Patriots are going to do</text>
  <text start="499.28" dur="4.5">the same exact thing they&amp;#39;re going for</text>
  <text start="502.159" dur="5.401">the source then I remember the central</text>
  <text start="503.78" dur="6.389">bank their grip is very tight on every</text>
  <text start="507.56" dur="4.409">single one of the nations around the</text>
  <text start="510.169" dur="4.86">world actually their grip on the world</text>
  <text start="511.969" dur="5.041">is very tight and Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="515.029" dur="4.44">and other nations they&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="517.01" dur="5.69">be very very careful on how they</text>
  <text start="519.469" dur="6.12">approach this but we see already that</text>
  <text start="522.7" dur="5.77">Trump and the Patriots they&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="525.589" dur="7.201">certain individuals in place like Judy</text>
  <text start="528.47" dur="7.619">Shelton Judy Shelton she&amp;#39;s a gold bug</text>
  <text start="532.79" dur="5.45">she likes sound money and she already</text>

  <text start="538.24" dur="7.57">investor she doesn&amp;#39;t want to hurt the</text>
  <text start="541.19" dur="9.42">people of America now again this is all</text>
  <text start="545.81" dur="8.339">being done and prepared to bring the</text>
  <text start="550.61" dur="7.08">central bank economy into a people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="554.149" dur="6.511">economy and it has to be done very very</text>
  <text start="557.69" dur="4.92">carefully what we see happening right</text>
  <text start="560.66" dur="6.119">now is we have</text>
  <text start="562.61" dur="9.03">shoe economy&amp;#39;s coexisting at the same</text>
  <text start="566.779" dur="7.921">exact time the only thing is the people</text>
  <text start="571.64" dur="6.33">of America they don&amp;#39;t realize this yet</text>
  <text start="574.7" dur="5.31">just like in the 60s the late 60s the</text>
  <text start="577.97" dur="5.25">people didn&amp;#39;t realize there was a new</text>
  <text start="580.01" dur="5.819">new economy that was being created which</text>
  <text start="583.22" dur="5.369">was the petrodollar economy the same</text>
  <text start="585.829" dur="5.581">thing is happening right now everyone is</text>
  <text start="588.589" dur="5.641">in the central bank economy they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="591.41" dur="5.88">realize there&amp;#39;s a sound money people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="594.23" dur="5.58">economy which is being built behind the</text>
  <text start="597.29" dur="4.919">scenes in the shadows and this is being</text>
  <text start="599.81" dur="5.67">done on purpose because we will be</text>
  <text start="602.209" dur="4.951">transitioning from one economy which is</text>
  <text start="605.48" dur="5.58">the central bank economy into the</text>
  <text start="607.16" dur="5.669">people&amp;#39;s economy which will benefit the</text>
  <text start="611.06" dur="4.56">people this will be an economy without</text>
  <text start="612.829" dur="5.731">the central bank and those individuals</text>
  <text start="615.62" dur="4.709">that Trump is choosing right now to go</text>
  <text start="618.56" dur="6.36">on the Federal Reserve Board he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="620.329" dur="8.311">picking them specifically for a task of</text>
  <text start="624.92" dur="9.32">bringing this economy the central bank</text>
  <text start="628.64" dur="8.759">system and moving it into a sound money</text>
  <text start="634.24" dur="5.98">system this is why he continually</text>
  <text start="637.399" dur="5.521">chooses those individuals that like gold</text>
  <text start="640.22" dur="5.91">those individuals that like sound money</text>
  <text start="642.92" dur="6.09">those individuals that like low interest</text>
  <text start="646.13" dur="5.91">rates the reason for this is because</text>
  <text start="649.01" dur="6.21">they need to keep the system alive with</text>
  <text start="652.04" dur="5.669">low interest rates with stimulus you</text>
  <text start="655.22" dur="6.78">also need those people that believe in</text>
  <text start="657.709" dur="9.24">gold in sound money this way they can</text>
  <text start="662" dur="8.55">create the link to the new economy</text>
  <text start="666.949" dur="6.601">that&amp;#39;s what these people are going to do</text>
  <text start="670.55" dur="6.99">and this is why Trump is choosing them</text>
  <text start="673.55" dur="7.229">it&amp;#39;s for a specific reason and as we can</text>
  <text start="677.54" dur="4.5">see the economic plan is moving forward</text>
  <text start="680.779" dur="4.201">and the mainstream media the central</text>
  <text start="682.04" dur="6.6">bank deep state they&amp;#39;re panicking about</text>
  <text start="684.98" dur="5.01">who Trump is choosing and the reason why</text>
  <text start="688.64" dur="3.27">these articles are coming out like this</text>
  <text start="689.99" dur="3.719">is because they must be very very</text>
  <text start="691.91" dur="4.86">nervous that these individuals that</text>
  <text start="693.709" dur="7.171">Trump just picked that these individuals</text>
  <text start="696.77" dur="6.21">most likely will be nominated and they</text>
  <text start="700.88" dur="5.43">will be placed into the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="702.98" dur="7.5">and they will do what Trump wants them</text>
  <text start="706.31" dur="8.25">to do this will then push the plan</text>
  <text start="710.48" dur="5.72">forward they know this this is why</text>
