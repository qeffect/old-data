  <text start="38.7" dur="6.929">censor and tax the internet we need to</text>
  <text start="42.42" dur="5.639">understand what the central bank the US</text>
  <text start="45.629" dur="4.801">government actually wants to do they</text>
  <text start="48.059" dur="6.331">already have control of the creation of</text>
  <text start="50.43" dur="6.87">money they already have control over the</text>
  <text start="54.39" dur="4.89">corporate media the next phase is to</text>
  <text start="57.3" dur="4.95">control the internet because right now</text>
  <text start="59.28" dur="6.12">it is the Wild West and there&amp;#39;s way too</text>
  <text start="62.25" dur="6.09">much information being sent along to</text>
  <text start="65.4" dur="5.61">different sites to different alternative</text>
  <text start="68.34" dur="5.73">media sites and they need to rein this</text>
  <text start="71.01" dur="5.249">in and control this and this is why the</text>
  <text start="74.07" dur="6.21">United States President Obama is ceding</text>
  <text start="76.259" dur="7.831">control over to the UN at this point to</text>
  <text start="80.28" dur="6.33">allow them to then tax the internet to</text>
  <text start="84.09" dur="6.12">bring in revenue into the UN and then</text>
  <text start="86.61" dur="6.6">also to censor the internet wherever</text>
  <text start="90.21" dur="6.479">they deemed they need to censor and this</text>
  <text start="93.21" dur="5.85">is the beginning stages of controlling</text>
  <text start="96.689" dur="4.591">pretty much everything the flow of</text>
  <text start="99.06" dur="4.739">information they have they will</text>
  <text start="101.28" dur="5.31">completely control and they will control</text>
  <text start="103.799" dur="4.801">the creation of money which they already</text>
  <text start="106.59" dur="4.44">have control over that and once they</text>
  <text start="108.6" dur="3.9">have this they control pretty much</text>
  <text start="111.03" dur="3.39">everything and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="112.5" dur="4.32">looking at right now and there is a</text>
  <text start="114.42" dur="4.799">report out there saying what the UN is</text>
  <text start="116.82" dur="5.25">planning on what they&amp;#39;re planning to do</text>
  <text start="119.219" dur="4.801">and we&amp;#39;re going to get into that a</text>
  <text start="122.07" dur="3.6">little bit later in this report let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="124.02" dur="2.55">start with the economic collapse news</text>
  <text start="125.67" dur="3.21">we&amp;#39;re going to head out the Spain</text>
  <text start="126.57" dur="5.13">yesterday i mentioned that spain was</text>
  <text start="128.88" dur="5.85">looking to have a referendum where</text>
  <text start="131.7" dur="4.679">catalonia was going to secede from spain</text>
  <text start="134.73" dur="3.6">but it looks like the spanish government</text>
  <text start="136.379" dur="4.771">has once again rejected a proposal</text>
  <text start="138.33" dur="4.32">submitted by catalonia</text>
  <text start="141.15" dur="5.1">and right now the proposal was rejected</text>
  <text start="142.65" dur="6.33">on Tuesday by large majority during a</text>
  <text start="146.25" dur="4.62">debate in the parliament Rajoy said the</text>
  <text start="148.98" dur="4.2">Constitution does not recognize their</text>
  <text start="150.87" dur="4.649">provincial or regional sovereignty of</text>
  <text start="153.18" dur="4.619">the northeastern region of Catalonia</text>
  <text start="155.519" dur="4.201">this proposal is not compatible with the</text>
  <text start="157.799" dur="4.41">spanish constitution so that deal is</text>
  <text start="159.72" dur="4.019">pretty much put to the side right now</text>
  <text start="162.209" dur="4.17">but the most likely they&amp;#39;ll bring it up</text>
  <text start="163.739" dur="6.09">again just like in Venice and in other</text>
  <text start="166.379" dur="6.2">areas now in Greece we do understand</text>
  <text start="169.829" dur="6.091">that they&amp;#39;re having a very rough time</text>
  <text start="172.579" dur="5.201">most of the people are unemployed most</text>
  <text start="175.92" dur="3.539">of the people are just making ends meet</text>
  <text start="177.78" dur="4.019">most of the people are going into the</text>
  <text start="179.459" dur="5.461">black market to get goods by using</text>
  <text start="181.799" dur="5.61">barter trade and other things and right</text>
  <text start="184.92" dur="3.959">now thousands of Greek workers have</text>
  <text start="187.409" dur="3.601">taken to the streets in the capital</text>
  <text start="188.879" dur="3.75">Athens to protest against the</text>
  <text start="191.01" dur="3.96">government&amp;#39;s austerity measures and we</text>
  <text start="192.629" dur="4.98">understand this every time the</text>
  <text start="194.97" dur="6.599">government takes on new debt from the</text>
  <text start="197.609" dur="6.78">IMF they have to get rid of jobs they</text>
  <text start="201.569" dur="5.161">have to cut programs and they take on</text>
  <text start="204.389" dur="4.651">more and more debt and they add more and</text>
  <text start="206.73" dur="4.86">more taxes to the people and pretty much</text>
  <text start="209.04" dur="6.449">this is not really going anywhere at</text>
  <text start="211.59" dur="8.64">this point all they&amp;#39;re doing is putting</text>
  <text start="215.489" dur="7.08">the the burden on the people and the</text>
  <text start="220.23" dur="4.14">people pretty much had enough of this</text>
  <text start="222.569" dur="3.151">already the government keeps telling</text>
  <text start="224.37" dur="2.67">them oh no next year it&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="225.72" dur="3.57">better oh it&amp;#39;s going to get better it</text>
  <text start="227.04" dur="4.939">has not gotten better it has gotten</text>
  <text start="229.29" dur="6.869">worse and worse and worse and right now</text>
  <text start="231.979" dur="6.4">they&amp;#39;re out there and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="236.159" dur="5.19">chanting they&amp;#39;re screaming they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="238.379" dur="4.741">pissed off and they&amp;#39;re out there saying</text>
  <text start="241.349" dur="3.81">this is our answer to the den ende</text>
  <text start="243.12" dur="5.16">policies that have squeezed workers and</text>
  <text start="245.159" dur="5.16">make people miserable said the GS EE and</text>
  <text start="248.28" dur="4.44">a statement adding we are striking and</text>
  <text start="250.319" dur="4.711">fighting to put an end to our sauce tera</text>
  <text start="252.72" dur="3.81">tea and there is about 6,000 people that</text>
  <text start="255.03" dur="4.65">join the protest including striking</text>
  <text start="256.53" dur="5.85">workers pensioners and unemployed Greeks</text>
  <text start="259.68" dur="5.01">at this time now we understand in Cyprus</text>
  <text start="262.38" dur="3.509">they still have capital controls even</text>
  <text start="264.69" dur="3.33">though they told us they&amp;#39;re removing</text>
  <text start="265.889" dur="4.171">them now they&amp;#39;re saying by the end of</text>
  <text start="268.02" dur="3.93">May that they&amp;#39;re going to remove all the</text>
  <text start="270.06" dur="3.81">capital controls but we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="271.95" dur="3.23">to actually see if they actually remove</text>
  <text start="273.87" dur="3.44">them they keep saying they can</text>
  <text start="275.18" dur="4.5">move them then they change it up and say</text>
  <text start="277.31" dur="4.139">oh no maybe in the spring now maybe the</text>
  <text start="279.68" dur="3.87">end of May maybe the beginning of summer</text>
  <text start="281.449" dur="5.851">and they did this in the beginning when</text>
  <text start="283.55" dur="6.42">they had capital controls they said two</text>
  <text start="287.3" dur="4.5">weeks maybe a month maybe two months and</text>
  <text start="289.97" dur="4.83">they continually keep changing this and</text>
  <text start="291.8" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;re still doing the same exact game</text>
  <text start="294.8" dur="7.679">now Japan decided to increase their</text>
  <text start="297.83" dur="7.08">sales tax and since they increase the</text>
  <text start="302.479" dur="5.851">sales tax from five to eight percent</text>
  <text start="304.91" dur="6.599">sales plummeted by twenty-five percent</text>
  <text start="308.33" dur="5.22">in Japan in one of their main department</text>
  <text start="311.509" dur="4.081">stores and people are now not buying</text>
  <text start="313.55" dur="4.589">high-ticket items because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="315.59" dur="5.04">completely out of their reach and that</text>
  <text start="318.139" dur="3.87">this looked like this might be a big big</text>
  <text start="320.63" dur="3.36">problem Japan because they&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="322.009" dur="3.72">same thing that we&amp;#39;re doing here in the</text>
  <text start="323.99" dur="3.6">United States they&amp;#39;re printing money</text>
  <text start="325.729" dur="4.321">they&amp;#39;ve been doing this for quite a</text>
  <text start="327.59" dur="5.639">while trying to keep their economy going</text>
  <text start="330.05" dur="6.44">and this might be a huge problem for</text>
  <text start="333.229" dur="7.081">Japan now here in the United States</text>
  <text start="336.49" dur="6.429">wholesale inventory build build up slows</text>
  <text start="340.31" dur="5.31">as sales miss for the third month in a</text>
  <text start="342.919" dur="5.43">row wholesale inventory growth slowed to</text>
  <text start="345.62" dur="5.549">a point five percent from a revised</text>
  <text start="348.349" dur="4.801">point eight percent this is the second</text>
  <text start="351.169" dur="5.37">slowest rate of inventory increase in</text>
  <text start="353.15" dur="5.46">seven months I guess those are the car</text>
  <text start="356.539" dur="4.291">manufacturers especially GM who is</text>
  <text start="358.61" dur="4.529">recalling a lot of cars reach the point</text>
  <text start="360.83" dur="5.429">where they&amp;#39;re trying to channel stuff</text>
  <text start="363.139" dur="4.53">the dealerships and they&amp;#39;re recalling a</text>
  <text start="366.259" dur="3.391">lot of cars right now so we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="367.669" dur="6.151">really seeing an inventory build-up at</text>
  <text start="369.65" dur="6.57">this time now we understand that retail</text>
  <text start="373.82" dur="4.409">is completely plummeting we understand</text>
  <text start="376.22" dur="4.77">that stores are closing and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="378.229" dur="4.351">starting to find out why well we already</text>
  <text start="380.99" dur="3.66">know why the people are pretty much</text>
  <text start="382.58" dur="3.809">tapped out they have no more money they</text>
  <text start="384.65" dur="4.139">they&amp;#39;re not spending on things they</text>
  <text start="386.389" dur="6.96">actually don&amp;#39;t need and right now</text>
  <text start="388.789" dur="7.771">consumer spending stalls and is falling</text>
  <text start="393.349" dur="5.611">at this time gallop reports and this is</text>
  <text start="396.56" dur="5.76">a survey that they did that consumers</text>
  <text start="398.96" dur="6.87">average daily spending flatline year</text>
  <text start="402.32" dur="5.37">over year and the stolen spending both</text>
  <text start="405.83" dur="3.12">month over month and compared with a</text>
  <text start="407.69" dur="3.42">year ago most</text>
  <text start="408.95" dur="4.92">likely signals a continuation of the</text>
  <text start="411.11" dur="5.27">lackluster retail sales and the sales</text>
  <text start="413.87" dur="7.65">are going to get worse as we go through</text>
  <text start="416.38" dur="7.9">2014 this is why retail is not doing</text>
  <text start="421.52" dur="5.49">well it&amp;#39;s not the weather it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="424.28" dur="5.88">because the moon is the full moon it has</text>
  <text start="427.01" dur="4.41">nothing to do with all these people all</text>
  <text start="430.16" dur="3.18">the corporate media and the government</text>
  <text start="431.42" dur="4.47">telling us why these are the problems</text>
  <text start="433.34" dur="4.74">because here we are now moving into</text>
  <text start="435.89" dur="4.29">spring we&amp;#39;re in April right now the bad</text>
  <text start="438.08" dur="4.5">weather is pretty much done the snow has</text>
  <text start="440.18" dur="4.59">been melting real estate should be</text>
  <text start="442.58" dur="5.16">popping now coming into spring summer</text>
  <text start="444.77" dur="5.64">retail sales should be recovering</text>
  <text start="447.74" dur="5.55">because the bad weathers done with but</text>
  <text start="450.41" dur="6">what are we actually seeing none of this</text>
  <text start="453.29" dur="5.28">why because this was a bunch of baloney</text>
  <text start="456.41" dur="4.17">that they were feeding us during that</text>
  <text start="458.57" dur="3.09">period of time now we&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="460.58" dur="4.17">to see what they&amp;#39;re going to come up</text>
  <text start="461.66" dur="5.46">with during the spring and summer most</text>
  <text start="464.75" dur="4.35">likely they&amp;#39;ll blame it on the hot</text>
  <text start="467.12" dur="4.41">weather or because of the winter months</text>
  <text start="469.1" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s affecting the spring and summer as</text>
  <text start="471.53" dur="4.86">we head into fall they have an excuse</text>
  <text start="473.87" dur="5.61">for everything but what we know is as</text>
  <text start="476.39" dur="5.88">more and more people get laid off they</text>
  <text start="479.48" dur="6.42">can&amp;#39;t find those full-time jobs they</text>
  <text start="482.27" dur="6.18">have a problem finding the same job at</text>
  <text start="485.9" dur="4.86">the same salary most of the people find</text>
  <text start="488.45" dur="4.74">jobs making less money or can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="490.76" dur="4.02">find those jobs and they turn two</text>
  <text start="493.19" dur="4.08">part-time jobs where they have to get</text>
  <text start="494.78" dur="4.05">one or two or maybe more part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="497.27" dur="6.71">and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of companies</text>
  <text start="498.83" dur="9.51">layoffs I mean barclays 15,000 RBS</text>
  <text start="503.98" dur="7.48">30,000 dell 15,000 sony macy&amp;#39;s JC Penney</text>
  <text start="508.34" dur="6.03">sbarro I mean we can go on and on and on</text>
  <text start="511.46" dur="5.22">store closing out of work everyone is</text>
  <text start="514.37" dur="4.5">laying off at this point and right now</text>
  <text start="516.68" dur="4.08">Bank of America they&amp;#39;re laying off an</text>
  <text start="518.87" dur="3.99">additional three thousand people and</text>
  <text start="520.76" dur="4.56">this is international and what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="522.86" dur="4.62">hearing is when they announced the</text>
  <text start="525.32" dur="4.17">domestic layoffs it&amp;#39;s going to be quite</text>
  <text start="527.48" dur="6.09">high and we&amp;#39;re going to see this from</text>
  <text start="529.49" dur="5.94">every single financial institution this</text>
  <text start="533.57" dur="4.77">is not going to stop because they</text>
  <text start="535.43" dur="4.59">realize what is coming here now I talked</text>
  <text start="538.34" dur="4.47">about real estate quite a bit and as</text>
  <text start="540.02" dur="4.83">everyone knows because I&amp;#39;m tracking real</text>
  <text start="542.81" dur="3.24">the state we want to know where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.85" dur="2.4">going we don&amp;#39;t want to hear the</text>
  <text start="546.05" dur="2.22">corporate media we don&amp;#39;t want to hear</text>
  <text start="547.25" dur="3.09">the president we don&amp;#39;t want to hear</text>
  <text start="548.27" dur="3.96">about the Fed saying retail is</text>
  <text start="550.34" dur="3.33">rebounding everyone should be in just</text>
  <text start="552.23" dur="4.049">like the stock market we want to know</text>
  <text start="553.67" dur="4.26">what&amp;#39;s going on and what the insiders</text>
  <text start="556.279" dur="4.381">are doing and what everyone is doing</text>
  <text start="557.93" dur="4.62">that no one&amp;#39;s talking about well what we</text>
  <text start="560.66" dur="3.48">are seeing is everyone&amp;#39;s getting out of</text>
  <text start="562.55" dur="4.95">real estate right now all those people</text>
  <text start="564.14" dur="6.12">the big money leaving real estate they</text>
  <text start="567.5" dur="5.58">understand it&amp;#39;s time to get out why</text>
  <text start="570.26" dur="5.73">because they see what is happening they</text>
  <text start="573.08" dur="6.15">pump this up to where they they can&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="575.99" dur="6.75">any further they realize the American</text>
  <text start="579.23" dur="6.15">people are not buying these homes and</text>
  <text start="582.74" dur="5.97">right now us home mortgages fell last</text>
  <text start="585.38" dur="5.19">week as refinancing slipped again the</text>
  <text start="588.71" dur="3.9">Mortgage Bankers Association said it</text>
  <text start="590.57" dur="4.2">seasonally adjusted index of mortgage</text>
  <text start="592.61" dur="4.83">applications activity which includes</text>
  <text start="594.77" dur="5.67">includes both refinancing and home</text>
  <text start="597.44" dur="5.43">purchase demand fell another one point</text>
  <text start="600.44" dur="4.08">six percent in the week ended April</text>
  <text start="602.87" dur="3.84">fourth so what are we seeing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="604.52" dur="4.53">moving at the spring right now usually</text>
  <text start="606.71" dur="5.16">in the real estate market spring summer</text>
  <text start="609.05" dur="4.65">very good time people planting flowers</text>

  <text start="613.7" dur="4.38">getting ready to sell their homes people</text>
  <text start="615.77" dur="4.98">are coming out to look at homes and we</text>
  <text start="618.08" dur="4.8">usually see a pop during this time but</text>
  <text start="620.75" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;re not seeing that pop we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="622.88" dur="5.04">it actually declined again and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="625.64" dur="4.68">seeing this happen and this is keeping</text>
  <text start="627.92" dur="5.13">with the trend because as we know and as</text>
  <text start="630.32" dur="5.04">I reported over and over the big money</text>

  <text start="875.329" dur="4.141">existence of free speech zones is based</text>
  <text start="877.459" dur="5.07">on the US Court decision stipulated that</text>

  <text start="993.17" dur="4.38">planning to use drones they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="995.09" dur="4.23">into it they spent around six hundred</text>

  <text start="1022.54" dur="5.16">doing this we understand why all these</text>
  <text start="1024.64" dur="5.19">agencies are will be using these drones</text>
  <text start="1027.7" dur="4.05">because when this collapse comes and the</text>
  <text start="1029.83" dur="4.83">martial law is implemented they will</text>
  <text start="1031.75" dur="4.8">need to keep control of the population</text>
  <text start="1034.66" dur="3.51">and this is why they&amp;#39;re removing your</text>

  <text start="1038.17" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re removing your rights to own a</text>

  <text start="1059.41" dur="6.45">these armored vehicles these tanks now</text>

  <text start="1102.019" dur="5.64">ambush it really boggles the mind but we</text>
  <text start="1106.19" dur="3.869">understand why there why this is</text>
  <text start="1107.659" dur="4.95">happening because DHS has spread across</text>
  <text start="1110.059" dur="5.55">the country they infiltrated all the</text>
  <text start="1112.609" dur="6.091">local law enforcement agencies and they</text>
  <text start="1115.609" dur="5.88">are having them come in compliance to</text>
  <text start="1118.7" dur="5.159">what they need them to do and and once</text>
  <text start="1121.489" dur="8.54">they&amp;#39;re in compliance they receive these</text>
  <text start="1123.859" dur="9.15">gifts tanks weapons uniforms other</text>
  <text start="1130.029" dur="7.45">electronic devices for spying because</text>

  <text start="1137.479" dur="6.42">enforcement agency across the country</text>
  <text start="1140.869" dur="5.43">because one martial law is enacted and</text>
  <text start="1143.899" dur="5.34">they have to control the people they</text>
  <text start="1146.299" dur="6.03">realize they will need the assistance of</text>
  <text start="1149.239" dur="6.3">all these police forces because they do</text>
  <text start="1152.329" dur="4.83">not have the personnel to control every</text>
  <text start="1155.539" dur="4.86">single person so now they broke it down</text>
  <text start="1157.159" dur="4.68">into a at a lower level and this is</text>
  <text start="1160.399" dur="4.801">local law enforcement but they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="1161.839" dur="5.79">command centers in the different states</text>

  <text start="1724.94" dur="6.06">and it seems like that you know this was</text>
  <text start="1728.63" dur="4.38">happening what is it 30-plus years ago</text>
  <text start="1731" dur="5.7">that this person was involved in</text>
  <text start="1733.01" dur="6.15">removing the central bank removing the</text>
  <text start="1736.7" dur="5.01">United States out from Iran because they</text>
  <text start="1739.16" dur="4.8">no longer wanted to use the US dollar to</text>

  <text start="1746.51" dur="4.77">completely they threw them out and ever</text>
  <text start="1749.15" dur="4.26">since then the central bankers have been</text>
  <text start="1751.28" dur="4.68">trying to get back into the country and</text>
  <text start="1753.41" dur="4.35">again this person had a hand in it 30</text>
  <text start="1755.96" dur="3.78">years ago and it&amp;#39;s absolutely ridiculous</text>
  <text start="1757.76" dur="4.14">because look what the United States has</text>
  <text start="1759.74" dur="4.26">done in the last 30 years and how many</text>
  <text start="1761.9" dur="6.24">regimes and how many countries they</text>
  <text start="1764" dur="6.42">overthrew and killed these leaders in</text>
  <text start="1768.14" dur="3.9">these countries to take over just to put</text>
  <text start="1770.42" dur="3.51">the central bank and to put their</text>
  <text start="1772.04" dur="3.99">natural resources back on the US dollar</text>
  <text start="1773.93" dur="4.38">so if you really look at this I mean</text>
  <text start="1776.03" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re just using this to say this is</text>
  <text start="1778.31" dur="3.54">why the deal is not going to go through</text>
  <text start="1780.14" dur="3.93">and it seems like they do this every so</text>
  <text start="1781.85" dur="3.39">often to say that Iran is doing</text>
  <text start="1784.07" dur="3.87">something because I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1785.24" dur="5.88">looking for a way to completely blame</text>
  <text start="1787.94" dur="5.4">the disintegration of the talks on Iran</text>
  <text start="1791.12" dur="4.5">so they can say okay the only option we</text>
  <text start="1793.34" dur="5.37">have left is to move in and strike them</text>
  <text start="1795.62" dur="5.58">or the talks are falling apart and they</text>
  <text start="1798.71" dur="4.41">created this false flag event where a</text>

  <text start="1996.45" dur="4.11">to get into Syria and that&amp;#39;s why you see</text>
  <text start="1999" dur="5.4">these false flags happening because</text>
  <text start="2000.56" dur="5.85">their motive is to remove Assad anyway</text>
  <text start="2004.4" dur="4.77">they possibly can and this is why you</text>
  <text start="2006.41" dur="4.69">see all this happening now Russia is</text>
