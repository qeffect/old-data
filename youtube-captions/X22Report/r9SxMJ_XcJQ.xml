  <text start="67.57" dur="5.7">as the system breaks down let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="70.9" dur="6">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="73.27" dur="5.16">as we can see people are watching the</text>
  <text start="76.9" dur="4.29">economy they&amp;#39;re watching the stock</text>
  <text start="78.43" dur="5.04">market many individuals are scratching</text>
  <text start="81.19" dur="5.459">their head wondering what is really</text>
  <text start="83.47" dur="5.069">going on here and many people are not</text>
  <text start="86.649" dur="3.931">really believing anymore that the</text>
  <text start="88.539" dur="3.901">economy is doing well especially those</text>
  <text start="90.58" dur="4.11">individuals that have lost their job</text>
  <text start="92.44" dur="4.23">especially in retail and in many</text>
  <text start="94.69" dur="5.22">corporations where they&amp;#39;re hearing</text>
  <text start="96.67" dur="6.51">rumors that there&amp;#39;s going to be layoffs</text>
  <text start="99.91" dur="5.16">where the company might be contracting</text>
  <text start="103.18" dur="4.77">where they&amp;#39;ll be closing plants or the</text>
  <text start="105.07" dur="5.28">be closing offices and people are very</text>
  <text start="107.95" dur="6.15">nervous and the you match confidence</text>
  <text start="110.35" dur="6.329">shows that well people are looking at</text>
  <text start="114.1" dur="4.65">the situation and the sentiment while</text>
  <text start="116.679" dur="5.071">that&amp;#39;s declining which is very</text>
  <text start="118.75" dur="5.43">interesting because consumer expectation</text>
  <text start="121.75" dur="4.17">is rising and current economic</text>
  <text start="124.18" dur="3.499">conditions is probably holding steady in</text>
  <text start="125.92" dur="5.31">the middle so what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="127.679" dur="6.221">this survey is going in all different</text>
  <text start="131.23" dur="6.539">directions right now because there is</text>
  <text start="133.9" dur="6.36">such a big mix-up and a such confusion</text>
  <text start="137.769" dur="4.681">in the economy right now that people</text>
  <text start="140.26" dur="4.89">don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s keeping the</text>
  <text start="142.45" dur="5.789">stock market up how the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="145.15" dur="5.52">well if all these stores are closing how</text>
  <text start="148.239" dur="6.211">the economy is doing well if only 8% of</text>
  <text start="150.67" dur="6.69">retail is going to online how housing</text>
  <text start="154.45" dur="4.86">well what&amp;#39;s going on with that because I</text>
  <text start="157.36" dur="5.129">put my house up for sale and I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="159.31" dur="5.76">sell it the traffic has dried up and I</text>
  <text start="162.489" dur="5.011">noticed around where I live there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="165.07" dur="5.729">houses for sale right now and there is</text>
  <text start="167.5" dur="4.59">no foot traffic to these homes actually</text>
  <text start="170.799" dur="3.151">I was speaking to a realtor the other</text>
  <text start="172.09" dur="4.05">day and they&amp;#39;re saying for some odd</text>
  <text start="173.95" dur="4.67">reason during this period where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="176.14" dur="5.7">supposed to be very very busy traffic</text>
  <text start="178.62" dur="6.489">people contacting them well it has</text>
  <text start="181.84" dur="4.75">decreased quite a bit and again we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="185.109" dur="3.251">not going to see this in every</text>
  <text start="186.59" dur="4.32">to the country because it takes time to</text>
  <text start="188.36" dur="4.709">spread but we are seeing it in many</text>
  <text start="190.91" dur="4.26">different areas like Manhattan we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="193.069" dur="5.041">seeing it in San Francisco now San</text>
  <text start="195.17" dur="5.16">Francisco home prices they have turned</text>
  <text start="198.11" dur="5.189">negative for the first time since 2011</text>
  <text start="200.33" dur="5.28">they declined by 2.5 percent in the</text>
  <text start="203.299" dur="5.491">first quarter and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="205.61" dur="6.239">that a growing number of individuals 46</text>
  <text start="208.79" dur="4.949">in fact 46 percent in fact said they</text>
  <text start="211.849" dur="4.95">could no longer stand to live in the</text>
  <text start="213.739" dur="5.371">preeminent American safe space of San</text>
  <text start="216.799" dur="6.961">Francisco primarily because the rent</text>
  <text start="219.11" dur="7.32">was just too high and the prices for</text>
  <text start="223.76" dur="5.759">purchasing the home it was just too</text>
  <text start="226.43" dur="6.51">expensive and people are trying to get</text>
  <text start="229.519" dur="6.33">out of that area we also see many other</text>
  <text start="232.94" dur="5.37">economic indicators showing us that the</text>
  <text start="235.849" dur="5.151">economy is continually declining now</text>
  <text start="238.31" dur="4.98">remember the central bank the deep state</text>
  <text start="241" dur="4.03">they&amp;#39;re going to continually try to make</text>
  <text start="243.29" dur="3.9">it look like the economy&amp;#39;s doing well</text>
  <text start="245.03" dur="4.2">right now because they have the ability</text>
  <text start="247.19" dur="3.449">to manipulate everything and everything</text>
  <text start="249.23" dur="2.849">that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the VIX now</text>
  <text start="250.639" dur="5.431">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the stock market</text>
  <text start="252.079" dur="6.421">the bonds the bond market the home real</text>
  <text start="256.07" dur="4.319">estate market the retail market they</text>
  <text start="258.5" dur="3.87">have the ability to manipulate it and</text>
  <text start="260.389" dur="4.65">make it look like the economy&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="262.37" dur="4.41">well even though we delve deep into the</text>
  <text start="265.039" dur="4.321">numbers and we can see that this is not</text>
  <text start="266.78" dur="5.28">the fact whatsoever core durable goods</text>
  <text start="269.36" dur="4.65">right now well new orders they plunged</text>
  <text start="272.06" dur="5.19">in April remember these are like washers</text>
  <text start="274.01" dur="5.25">dryers a one-time big purchase and</text>
  <text start="277.25" dur="3.96">people are not going out and purchasing</text>
  <text start="279.26" dur="7.529">these type of items now they&amp;#39;ve dropped</text>
  <text start="281.21" dur="8.67">by 0.7% and new orders fell by 0.4% so</text>
  <text start="286.789" dur="6.241">we&amp;#39;re seeing many economic indicators</text>
  <text start="289.88" dur="5.61">and they&amp;#39;re all headed to the downside</text>
  <text start="293.03" dur="5.79">right now now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="295.49" dur="6.63">that the first quarter GDP and we knew</text>
  <text start="298.82" dur="5.49">this was coming it was revised from</text>
  <text start="302.12" dur="3.419">point seven percent to one point two</text>
  <text start="304.31" dur="2.94">percent because what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="305.539" dur="3.391">at this point is they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="307.25" dur="3.539">bring that second quarter GDP number</text>
  <text start="308.93" dur="3.81">much higher to make it look like the</text>
  <text start="310.789" dur="4.56">economy&amp;#39;s doing much better than it</text>
  <text start="312.74" dur="4.08">really is this is why the Fed was out</text>
  <text start="315.349" dur="3.211">there saying that the first quarter was</text>
  <text start="316.82" dur="3.45">an anomaly they&amp;#39;re going to go back and</text>
  <text start="318.56" dur="3.51">like we&amp;#39;re seeing there</text>
  <text start="320.27" dur="4.8">is the number and they&amp;#39;re saying oh well</text>
  <text start="322.07" dur="5.76">the economy is not as bad as it seems it</text>
  <text start="325.07" dur="5.37">is getting better don&amp;#39;t worry about it</text>
  <text start="327.83" dur="4.26">things are just fine and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="330.44" dur="2.97">to convince everyone that listen</text>
  <text start="332.09" dur="3.75">everything that the central bank has</text>
  <text start="333.41" dur="4.8">done all the money printing and</text>
  <text start="335.84" dur="5.37">everything like that has basically</text>
  <text start="338.21" dur="5.82">helped the economy out it has recovered</text>
  <text start="341.21" dur="5.25">and the economy now is picking up steam</text>
  <text start="344.03" dur="4.26">which we know is a complete lie remember</text>
  <text start="346.46" dur="4.26">these numbers first of all are the</text>
  <text start="348.29" dur="6.84">manipulated numbers the actual GDP</text>
  <text start="350.72" dur="6.78">number is around negative 0.6% and even</text>
  <text start="355.13" dur="5.63">the revised number that was based off of</text>
  <text start="357.5" dur="6.33">business investment housing investment</text>
  <text start="360.76" dur="5.11">consumer spending and they manipulated</text>
  <text start="363.83" dur="4.62">those numbers to push the GDP number up</text>
  <text start="365.87" dur="4.08">and they got this new number and they do</text>
  <text start="368.45" dur="4.02">this all the time they did it all</text>
  <text start="369.95" dur="4.11">throughout Obama&amp;#39;s presidency trying to</text>
  <text start="372.47" dur="3.69">bring this number up to make it look a</text>
  <text start="374.06" dur="3.69">lot better than it really is and they do</text>
  <text start="376.16" dur="4.35">as much as they possibly can but they</text>
  <text start="377.75" dur="5.43">can never reach that 3% actually this</text>
  <text start="380.51" dur="5.13">didn&amp;#39;t even reach 2% this time I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="383.18" dur="4.5">the second quarter is going to reach 2%</text>
  <text start="385.64" dur="4.47">and you&amp;#39;re going to see the Fed raise</text>
  <text start="387.68" dur="4.95">the interest rates but we know behind</text>
  <text start="390.11" dur="4.44">the scenes the economy well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="392.63" dur="4.02">completely falling apart and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.55" dur="3.3">getting worse and worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="396.65" dur="2.37">it&amp;#39;s almost like the unemployment</text>
  <text start="397.85" dur="2.37">numbers do you really believe that</text>
  <text start="399.02" dur="4.47">unemployment is at four point four</text>
  <text start="400.22" dur="5.19">percent completely impossible with all</text>
  <text start="403.49" dur="5.37">the retail stores closing with</text>
  <text start="405.41" dur="6.51">corporations laying off everyone is just</text>
  <text start="408.86" dur="5.82">still working it makes no sense but</text>
  <text start="411.92" dur="5.19">certain states right now they realize</text>
  <text start="414.68" dur="4.38">that the economy is rapidly falling</text>
  <text start="417.11" dur="3.99">apart and they realize when the system</text>
  <text start="419.06" dur="5.79">collapses and everyone needs to realizes</text>
  <text start="421.1" dur="6.44">these paper dollars the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="424.85" dur="5.46">Note they&amp;#39;re going to disappear and</text>
  <text start="427.54" dur="5.35">they&amp;#39;ll going to be worth absolutely</text>
  <text start="430.31" dur="4.89">nothing and we know that Arizona right</text>
  <text start="432.89" dur="4.44">now they had this bill which was going</text>
  <text start="435.2" dur="4.62">to repeal the stop the state capital</text>
  <text start="437.33" dur="4.65">gains tax on gold and silver and Monday</text>
  <text start="439.82" dur="4.62">Governor Doug Ducey signed a bill into</text>
  <text start="441.98" dur="6.06">law that eliminates state capital gain</text>
  <text start="444.44" dur="6.48">taxes on gold and silver and it&amp;#39;s a tax</text>
  <text start="448.04" dur="4.8">repeal will not only benefit Arizonans</text>
  <text start="450.92" dur="3.209">who invest in gold and silver</text>
  <text start="452.84" dur="4.349">it will also facilitate</text>
  <text start="454.129" dur="4.83">their use as currency and undermine the</text>
  <text start="457.189" dur="5.04">Federal Reserve&amp;#39;s monopoly on money in</text>
  <text start="458.959" dur="6.24">effect the passage into law will</text>
  <text start="462.229" dur="6.18">legalize the Constitution by treating</text>
  <text start="465.199" dur="5.31">gold and silver as money Ron Paul travel</text>
  <text start="468.409" dur="5.61">to Arizona and testified on its behalf</text>
  <text start="470.509" dur="6.06">we ought not to tax money and that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="474.019" dur="6.63">good idea it makes no sense to tax money</text>
  <text start="476.569" dur="7.68">he said paper is not money it&amp;#39;s fraud so</text>
  <text start="480.649" dur="5.88">right now in Arizona all debts and taxes</text>
  <text start="484.249" dur="4.41">must be paid with either the Federal</text>
  <text start="486.529" dur="4.11">Reserve Note authorizes Leaguer ten</text>
  <text start="488.659" dur="4.71">legal tender by the Congress or with</text>
  <text start="490.639" dur="4.17">coins issued by the US Treasury and we</text>
  <text start="493.369" dur="3.72">know that they don&amp;#39;t have any silver or</text>

  <text start="502.249" dur="7.41">but gold and silver coin a tender in</text>

  <text start="509.659" dur="4.021">step towards the constitutional</text>
  <text start="511.009" dur="6.09">requirement ignored for many many</text>
  <text start="513.68" dur="6.18">decades in every state such a tactic</text>
  <text start="517.099" dur="4.47">would undermine the monopoly of the</text>
  <text start="519.86" dur="3.829">Federal Reserve by introducing</text>
  <text start="521.569" dur="5.37">competition into the monetary system</text>
  <text start="523.689" dur="4.721">over time as read as residents of the</text>
  <text start="526.939" dur="2.34">state used both Federal Reserve notes</text>
  <text start="528.41" dur="2.7">and silver in gold</text>
  <text start="529.279" dur="5.071">guess what happened to the Federal</text>
  <text start="531.11" dur="5.82">Reserve Note well it loses its value and</text>
  <text start="534.35" dur="4.44">people will stop using the Federal</text>
  <text start="536.93" dur="5.159">Reserve Note because gold and silver</text>
  <text start="538.79" dur="5.279">will retain its value as it has done</text>
  <text start="542.089" dur="4.771">over thousands and thousands of years</text>
  <text start="544.069" dur="4.83">and eventually people will no longer</text>
  <text start="546.86" dur="4.409">even use the Federal Reserve Note this</text>
  <text start="548.899" dur="3.901">is what the central bank is so worried</text>
  <text start="551.269" dur="3.3">about and we can see there are many</text>
  <text start="552.8" dur="4.95">other states that are pushing the same</text>
  <text start="554.569" dur="6.411">exact laws and to me when you look at</text>
  <text start="557.75" dur="7.11">this the states they are preparing for</text>
  <text start="560.98" dur="7.229">the collapse of the system because they</text>
  <text start="564.86" dur="6.779">will be ready to handle the next system</text>
  <text start="568.209" dur="6.341">now Mark Zuckerberg he was out there he</text>
  <text start="571.639" dur="6.091">was giving a speech to Harvard graduates</text>
  <text start="574.55" dur="5.55">and he said in his speech we should have</text>
  <text start="577.73" dur="5.4">a society that measures progress not by</text>
  <text start="580.1" dur="4.95">economic metrics like GDP but by how</text>
  <text start="583.13" dur="4.35">many of us have a role we find</text>
  <text start="585.05" dur="3.01">meaningful we should explore ideas like</text>
  <text start="587.48" dur="4.27">universe</text>
  <text start="588.06" dur="5.94">basic income to make sure everyone has a</text>
  <text start="591.75" dur="4.95">cushion to try new ideas now what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="594" dur="4.74">pushing right now and of course he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="596.7" dur="5.75">mouthpiece of the deep state same thing</text>
  <text start="598.74" dur="8.28">with Bill Gates is he wants everyone to</text>
  <text start="602.45" dur="5.68">receive income from the government which</text>
  <text start="607.02" dur="2.97">the government is then going to get it</text>
  <text start="608.13" dur="4.98">from the central bank which means</text>
  <text start="609.99" dur="6.21">everyone is going to get a paycheck from</text>
  <text start="613.11" dur="5.82">the government now the question is first</text>
  <text start="616.2" dur="4.92">of all where&amp;#39;s this coming from well</text>
  <text start="618.93" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s coming from those individuals that</text>
  <text start="621.12" dur="3.96">are working it&amp;#39;s coming from their taxes</text>
  <text start="622.86" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s coming from borrowed money with</text>
  <text start="625.08" dur="5.82">interest attached on it this is not free</text>
  <text start="628.23" dur="6.24">money that could be handed out someone</text>
  <text start="630.9" dur="7.07">eventually has to pay for it and we</text>
  <text start="634.47" dur="6.45">already have a 20 trillion dollar debt</text>
  <text start="637.97" dur="5.41">actually the debt is really much much</text>
  <text start="640.92" dur="6.21">higher than that it&amp;#39;s around two hundred</text>
  <text start="643.38" dur="7.26">and two hundred trillion or so but this</text>
  <text start="647.13" dur="5.34">proposal is going to look really good to</text>
  <text start="650.64" dur="3.51">a lot of people at first glance because</text>
  <text start="652.47" dur="4.77">people say whoa you&amp;#39;re going to give me</text>
  <text start="654.15" dur="5.16">money and I could just sit at home yes</text>
  <text start="657.24" dur="4.32">this is what I want to do so what</text>
  <text start="659.31" dur="4.53">Zuckerberg is trying to say is that if</text>
  <text start="661.56" dur="4.65">you receive this free money from the</text>

  <text start="821.279" dur="6.661">transfer the wealth up to the 1% this</text>
  <text start="824.61" dur="7.469">money is being used to keep people quiet</text>
  <text start="827.94" dur="6.509">as the system breaks down that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="832.079" dur="5.07">purpose of this and what they&amp;#39;re hoping</text>
  <text start="834.449" dur="4.741">that this that will occur is that people</text>
  <text start="837.149" dur="3.841">will take this money they&amp;#39;ll stay quiet</text>
  <text start="839.19" dur="4.62">in their home and they&amp;#39;ll go out and</text>
  <text start="840.99" dur="6">they&amp;#39;ll put it into retail to keep</text>
  <text start="843.81" dur="4.889">everything operational but what happens</text>
  <text start="846.99" dur="3.9">is yes this will work right in the</text>
  <text start="848.699" dur="4.62">beginning but as time goes on and more</text>
  <text start="850.89" dur="4.41">and more of this money is put out there</text>
  <text start="853.319" dur="2.401">and people maybe are saving the money</text>
  <text start="855.3" dur="3.329">instead of</text>
  <text start="855.72" dur="6.15">purchasing things the debt gets larger</text>
  <text start="858.629" dur="5.041">the interest on the debt gets larger</text>
  <text start="861.87" dur="5.279">they might even have to lower the</text>
  <text start="863.67" dur="5.94">interest rates and what happens is there</text>
  <text start="867.149" dur="4.74">are no tax receipts coming in they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="869.61" dur="4.74">very tiny and they can&amp;#39;t pay for the</text>
  <text start="871.889" dur="5.01">debt and the system starts to break down</text>
  <text start="874.35" dur="4.919">this experiment has been used in other</text>
  <text start="876.899" dur="5.461">countries and it has failed every single</text>
  <text start="879.269" dur="6.271">time but of course when the system is</text>
  <text start="882.36" dur="4.62">breaking down what else do they do they</text>
  <text start="885.54" dur="4.109">need to do something because they want</text>
  <text start="886.98" dur="5.099">to restart the system the way they had</text>
  <text start="889.649" dur="4.141">it before where they can wipe out pretty</text>
  <text start="892.079" dur="3.721">much all the debt they can start</text>
  <text start="893.79" dur="3.45">printing the money once again attached</text>
  <text start="895.8" dur="2.519">to interest and if they can keep</text>
  <text start="897.24" dur="5.849">everyone quiet</text>
  <text start="898.319" dur="8.101">it works in their favor now China they</text>
  <text start="903.089" dur="6.18">have been using the Fayette system to</text>
  <text start="906.42" dur="5.31">build roads bridges buildings empty</text>
  <text start="909.269" dur="3.901">cities they&amp;#39;ve been spending it like</text>
  <text start="911.73" dur="3.089">crazy and a lot of people saying well</text>
  <text start="913.17" dur="3.479">China is ridiculous I can&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="914.819" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re doing this think about what</text>
  <text start="916.649" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re doing right now and and think</text>
  <text start="918.089" dur="4.44">about what you would do you know the</text>
  <text start="920.129" dur="4.471">finance system is going to come to an</text>
  <text start="922.529" dur="5.31">end you know that this system was</text>
  <text start="924.6" dur="5.64">created by the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="927.839" dur="4.68">banks and you know once it goes away</text>
  <text start="930.24" dur="3.899">well pretty much all the debts going to</text>
  <text start="932.519" dur="4.56">disappear the whole system is going to</text>
  <text start="934.139" dur="6.39">be restarted one way or another and you</text>
  <text start="937.079" dur="7.26">have all this Fayette money build and</text>
  <text start="940.529" dur="7.261">spend as much as you possibly can until</text>
  <text start="944.339" dur="6.781">the system comes to an end now while</text>
  <text start="947.79" dur="5.669">you&amp;#39;re doing this buy as much gold as</text>
  <text start="951.12" dur="4.35">you possibly can to hedge against</text>
  <text start="953.459" dur="4.86">everything that you&amp;#39;re doing because</text>
  <text start="955.47" dur="6.119">once the fire system goes down well all</text>
  <text start="958.319" dur="6.51">your cities were built on phony money</text>
  <text start="961.589" dur="7.05">and the goal that you&amp;#39;ve been acquiring</text>
  <text start="964.829" dur="7.171">all this time well guess what it allows</text>
  <text start="968.639" dur="6.081">your system to continually operate and</text>
  <text start="972" dur="5.91">this is exactly what China has done</text>
  <text start="974.72" dur="5.71">actually not just China other countries</text>
  <text start="977.91" dur="4.979">have done this in the same way and</text>
  <text start="980.43" dur="4.529">Russia has been acquiring gold Russia</text>

  <text start="988.319" dur="2.831">same</text>
  <text start="989.11" dur="4.83">because they understand the system is</text>
  <text start="991.15" dur="5.82">going to come down why don&amp;#39;t we use the</text>
  <text start="993.94" dur="4.23">system right now to our benefit and this</text>
  <text start="996.97" dur="3.45">is what they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="998.17" dur="5.46">just like the wealthy they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
