  <text start="61.11" dur="6.509">more and more economic indicators</text>
  <text start="63.83" dur="4.69">showing us that this economic recovery</text>
  <text start="67.619" dur="2.431">that the United States government</text>

  <text start="78.509" dur="8.97">they&amp;#39;re declining and we have a huge</text>
  <text start="82.14" dur="6.75">problem coming up very soon because what</text>

  <text start="88.89" dur="5.64">looking at is a recession / depression</text>
  <text start="92.6" dur="4.75">doesn&amp;#39;t matter if the government</text>

  <text start="97.35" dur="5.19">2008 they really didn&amp;#39;t announce that</text>
  <text start="100.47" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;re in a recession until a little bit</text>
  <text start="102.54" dur="4.859">later on I mean people knew things were</text>
  <text start="105.24" dur="4.65">wrong people realized that people were</text>
  <text start="107.399" dur="3.871">getting laid off left and right people</text>

  <text start="113.52" dur="6.029">already people lost their homes but we</text>
  <text start="117.63" dur="4.199">had individuals out there saying that</text>
  <text start="119.549" dur="6.151">don&amp;#39;t worry by the spring of 2009</text>
  <text start="121.829" dur="6.021">everything will be fine the real estate</text>
  <text start="125.7" dur="4.74">market will be back to where it was</text>
  <text start="127.85" dur="4.54">actually Larry on from the national</text>
  <text start="130.44" dur="4.26">association of realtors he tells it</text>
  <text start="132.39" dur="5.939">during the winter real estate was going</text>
  <text start="134.7" dur="7.069">to return to the way it was and it never</text>
  <text start="138.329" dur="7.051">did so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="141.769" dur="6.161">this contraction this decline of the</text>
  <text start="145.38" dur="4.859">entire economy and the powers that be</text>
  <text start="147.93" dur="5.01">the elite the shadow government the</text>
  <text start="150.239" dur="5.31">central bank they&amp;#39;re running out of time</text>
  <text start="152.94" dur="7.56">and this is why we see an acceleration</text>
  <text start="155.549" dur="8.101">around the world for a push to cover up</text>
  <text start="160.5" dur="7.29">this entire economic collapse</text>
  <text start="163.65" dur="6.929">and we can see as we move throughout</text>
  <text start="167.79" dur="7.74">this year the situation is going to</text>
  <text start="170.579" dur="6.571">accelerate it&amp;#39;s going to get worse not</text>
  <text start="175.53" dur="4.14">just here in the United States not just</text>
  <text start="177.15" dur="4.08">the economy not just everything that</text>
  <text start="179.67" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at but the</text>
  <text start="181.23" dur="5.129">geopolitical political situation around</text>
  <text start="183.81" dur="8.58">the world is just going to get worse and</text>
  <text start="186.359" dur="11.371">worse until we hear the big bang now out</text>
  <text start="192.39" dur="9.9">in Greece we see that China they have</text>
  <text start="197.73" dur="7.8">purchased the largest port in Greece</text>
  <text start="202.29" dur="5.25">China&amp;#39;s costco shipping group they</text>
  <text start="205.53" dur="5.849">completed the acquisition of 51 percent</text>
  <text start="207.54" dur="6.899">stake in the Greek port and they are the</text>
  <text start="211.379" dur="4.53">controlling shareholder and we see what</text>
  <text start="214.439" dur="4.651">China and Russia are doing right now</text>
  <text start="215.909" dur="4.771">they&amp;#39;re going into countries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="219.09" dur="3.45">spending a lot of money in these</text>
  <text start="220.68" dur="6.179">countries helping the infrastructure</text>
  <text start="222.54" dur="6.18">helping the economy of the country get</text>
  <text start="226.859" dur="3.151">back on its feet because the United</text>
  <text start="228.72" dur="5.43">States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="230.01" dur="6">they&amp;#39;ve been destroying economies and we</text>
  <text start="234.15" dur="5.009">see the opposite happening with China</text>
  <text start="236.01" dur="5.569">and Russia the company paid about 311</text>
  <text start="239.159" dur="4.92">million for its stake in this port and</text>
  <text start="241.579" dur="5.59">they plan to increase their shares up to</text>
  <text start="244.079" dur="6.291">sixty-seven percent and this means more</text>
  <text start="247.169" dur="7.65">ships more products coming into Greece</text>
  <text start="250.37" dur="7.72">and we can see right now that most</text>
  <text start="254.819" dur="6.961">likely in the end Greece will definitely</text>
  <text start="258.09" dur="6.72">move away from the European Union away</text>
  <text start="261.78" dur="5.54">from the US dollar just like every other</text>
  <text start="264.81" dur="4.919">country is doing right now and of course</text>
  <text start="267.32" dur="4.719">we see throughout the European Union</text>
  <text start="269.729" dur="3.781">many of the countries are saying we</text>
  <text start="272.039" dur="5.071">don&amp;#39;t want these sanctions with Russia</text>
  <text start="273.51" dur="5.49">anymore our economies are hurting we</text>
  <text start="277.11" dur="3.089">need to get rid of them but we can see</text>
  <text start="279" dur="6.12">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="280.199" dur="7.291">bankers they&amp;#39;re keeping them in the</text>
  <text start="285.12" dur="5.34">European Union saying you will not</text>
  <text start="287.49" dur="6.479">deviate from the plan whatsoever you</text>
  <text start="290.46" dur="6.179">will keep these sanctions now here in</text>
  <text start="293.969" dur="3.541">the United States they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="296.639" dur="3.241">the illusion</text>
  <text start="297.51" dur="4.11">live there trying to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="299.88" dur="5.49">that everything is fine and actually</text>
  <text start="301.62" dur="6.03">back in February of 2016 when Obama came</text>
  <text start="305.37" dur="4.44">out and he was talking about how the</text>
  <text start="307.65" dur="3.81">economy was doing so well that if you</text>
  <text start="309.81" dur="5.13">don&amp;#39;t believe it you&amp;#39;re you know you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="311.46" dur="7.29">peddling fiction and he boasted about</text>
  <text start="314.94" dur="6.12">the job growth and the wage growth and</text>
  <text start="318.75" dur="4.98">how the economy is stronger the job</text>
  <text start="321.06" dur="5.76">market was stronger and everyone&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="323.73" dur="5.7">get a bigger paycheck well maybe just</text>
  <text start="326.82" dur="4.26">the central bank&amp;#39;s those people in the</text>
  <text start="329.43" dur="3.66">US government maybe they&amp;#39;re getting the</text>
  <text start="331.08" dur="3.96">bigger paychecks but the rest of the</text>
  <text start="333.09" dur="3.72">people around them and also the insiders</text>
  <text start="335.04" dur="4.08">the rest of the people around the world</text>
  <text start="336.81" dur="5.1">around the country i should say they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="339.12" dur="6.18">getting smaller paychecks and it turns</text>
  <text start="341.91" dur="9.27">out that the bill has the bureau of</text>
  <text start="345.3" dur="11.43">labor statistics just revised the wage</text>
  <text start="351.18" dur="8.64">growth now they came out and they did a</text>
  <text start="356.73" dur="5.58">downward reversion revision in the first</text>
  <text start="359.82" dur="6">quarter of 2016 year-on-year and real</text>
  <text start="362.31" dur="6.33">wage growth went from a positive four</text>
  <text start="365.82" dur="6.21">point two percent down to a negative</text>
  <text start="368.64" dur="11.84">point four percent that&amp;#39;s a full point</text>
  <text start="372.03" dur="13.17">six percent swing so when we hear this</text>
  <text start="380.48" dur="8.8">we know the president was lying this was</text>
  <text start="385.2" dur="6.93">created at that time to make it look</text>
  <text start="389.28" dur="4.17">like everything was great and then then</text>
  <text start="392.13" dur="2.94">what they do is they go back later and</text>
  <text start="393.45" dur="5.21">then revise everything lower and</text>
  <text start="395.07" dur="8.4">hopefully nobody notices a thing and</text>
  <text start="398.66" dur="10.71">this is what just happened and this</text>
  <text start="403.47" dur="10.17">shows us right now that we see slow</text>
  <text start="409.37" dur="10.12">growth we don&amp;#39;t see steady gains anymore</text>
  <text start="413.64" dur="10.02">and everything is being revised down</text>
  <text start="419.49" dur="8.03">right now so there is no rising wage</text>
  <text start="423.66" dur="6.42">recovery there is no job recovery and</text>
  <text start="427.52" dur="3.68">when we look at the information provided</text>
  <text start="430.08" dur="4.93">to us</text>
  <text start="431.2" dur="5.58">somebody&amp;#39;s lying once again initial</text>
  <text start="435.01" dur="5.54">jobless claims they drop by a thousand</text>
  <text start="436.78" dur="8.34">at 266,000 from a downwardly revised</text>
  <text start="440.55" dur="7.89">267,000 and they continually put out the</text>
  <text start="445.12" dur="6.36">propaganda that we&amp;#39;re at 43 year lows</text>
  <text start="448.44" dur="5.59">well productivity is continually</text>
  <text start="451.48" dur="6.93">dropping and they&amp;#39;re trying to tell us</text>
  <text start="454.03" dur="7.53">that initial jobless claims are at 43</text>
  <text start="458.41" dur="7.29">year lows so what are all these workers</text>
  <text start="461.56" dur="7.77">doing well basically nothing but very</text>
  <text start="465.7" dur="7.19">interestingly is that we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="469.33" dur="8.61">before this is what it looks like right</text>
  <text start="472.89" dur="9.45">before the crash the decline in jobless</text>
  <text start="477.94" dur="8.73">claims is following the exact same cycle</text>
  <text start="482.34" dur="7.5">as we saw in 1989 two thousand two</text>
  <text start="486.67" dur="6.17">thousand seven the bottom gets hit and</text>
  <text start="489.84" dur="8.83">then claims rise and then surged and</text>
  <text start="492.84" dur="10.39">this is what happens the recession job</text>
  <text start="498.67" dur="7.68">cuts in a recession supply sharply</text>
  <text start="503.23" dur="5.52">exceeds demand layoffs surge as</text>
  <text start="506.35" dur="4.89">businesses cut inventories of people and</text>
  <text start="508.75" dur="6.06">goods then we see a post-recession</text>
  <text start="511.24" dur="6.239">restocking after the recession job cuts</text>
  <text start="514.81" dur="5.4">slow some labor demand even starts to</text>
  <text start="517.479" dur="5.701">creep back in as businesses were too</text>
  <text start="520.21" dur="4.92">lean and now need to restock the Javas</text>
  <text start="523.18" dur="4.59">claims year-over-year is sharply</text>
  <text start="525.13" dur="5.16">negative then we see a mid-cycle</text>
  <text start="527.77" dur="5.48">inventory expansion the business cycle</text>
  <text start="530.29" dur="6.24">shifts from being backward looking and</text>
  <text start="533.25" dur="6.16">turns forward-looking and then we have</text>
  <text start="536.53" dur="5.7">pre recession end of inventory expansion</text>
  <text start="539.41" dur="5.4">an equilibrium in labor demand has been</text>
  <text start="542.23" dur="6.26">reached an existing staff levels meet</text>
  <text start="544.81" dur="5.91">expected the man layoffs then pick up as</text>
  <text start="548.49" dur="4.87">employers look for profit growth and</text>
  <text start="550.72" dur="7.2">production efficiencies this pattern</text>
  <text start="553.36" dur="10.979">repeats itself every business cycle and</text>
  <text start="557.92" dur="11.69">we saw the same things in 1989 2002</text>
  <text start="564.339" dur="8.841">seven and here we are at the same place</text>
  <text start="569.61" dur="6.909">we were going to see layoffs pick up and</text>
  <text start="573.18" dur="7.93">we&amp;#39;re going to see the initial job claim</text>
  <text start="576.519" dur="7.17">the initial jobless claims surge we see</text>
  <text start="581.11" dur="8.31">that Macy&amp;#39;s right now they are closing</text>
  <text start="583.689" dur="9.031">100 of its 728 stores with a loss of 1</text>
  <text start="589.42" dur="6.8">billion in revenues again we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="592.72" dur="7.44">what is happening out in the real world</text>
  <text start="596.22" dur="5.799">retail is contracting think about all</text>
  <text start="600.16" dur="4.77">these people that are going to lose</text>
  <text start="602.019" dur="5.43">their jobs right now we&amp;#39;ve had thousands</text>
  <text start="604.93" dur="5.699">upon thousands of stores closed since</text>
  <text start="607.449" dur="7.05">the beginning of this year and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="610.629" dur="7.71">improving the US consumer comfort it has</text>
  <text start="614.499" dur="6.15">crashed to three-month lows and of</text>
  <text start="618.339" dur="7.381">course the stock market continually</text>
  <text start="620.649" dur="7.951">Rises now we know the u.s. is out there</text>
  <text start="625.72" dur="4.859">trying to convince us that the economy</text>
  <text start="628.6" dur="4.32">is doing well the unemployment rate is</text>
  <text start="630.579" dur="5.401">at four point nine percent we&amp;#39;ve added</text>
  <text start="632.92" dur="4.62">so many jobs it&amp;#39;s incredible but every</text>
  <text start="635.98" dur="3.409">other economic indicator shows us</text>
  <text start="637.54" dur="5.459">something opposite that is happening</text>
  <text start="639.389" dur="5.2">because it fits our model where people</text>
  <text start="642.999" dur="3.421">don&amp;#39;t have jobs so people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="644.589" dur="4.5">spending in retail retail is closing</text>
  <text start="646.42" dur="5.159">since retail is closing factory orders</text>
  <text start="649.089" dur="6.391">are down manufacturing is declining the</text>
  <text start="651.579" dur="6.271">Baltic Dry Index declines and it all</text>
  <text start="655.48" dur="6.029">follows the same pattern we looked at</text>
  <text start="657.85" dur="5.399">the US federal tax receipts well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="661.509" dur="6.68">just rising at one point two percent</text>
  <text start="663.249" dur="7.71">year-over-year now during good times</text>
  <text start="668.189" dur="5.351">these receipts are around thirteen to</text>
  <text start="670.959" dur="6.151">fifteen percent Ashley back in June of</text>
  <text start="673.54" dur="7.649">2013 they were at thirteen percent the</text>
  <text start="677.11" dur="8.76">last six times tax receipt growth was at</text>
  <text start="681.189" dur="8.76">this level this week level we were</text>
  <text start="685.87" dur="9.899">already in a recession and here we are</text>
  <text start="689.949" dur="7.851">once again right before 2008 hit we were</text>
  <text start="695.769" dur="7.63">at the one</text>
  <text start="697.8" dur="9.479">percent year-over-year tax receipts and</text>
  <text start="703.399" dur="8.291">then as soon as 2008 hit we dropped to</text>
  <text start="707.279" dur="7.05">like negative seventeen percent here we</text>
  <text start="711.69" dur="6.48">are we&amp;#39;re following the same patterns</text>
  <text start="714.329" dur="7.561">once again this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="718.17" dur="6.27">disaster so we can ignore these tax</text>
  <text start="721.89" dur="5.009">receipts because with the US tax</text>
  <text start="724.44" dur="8.94">receipts we just proved the economic</text>
  <text start="726.899" dur="9.511">recovery is non-existent it exposes the</text>
  <text start="733.38" dur="4.92">entire propaganda machine you can</text>
  <text start="736.41" dur="5.19">manipulate statistics you can manipulate</text>
  <text start="738.3" dur="5.18">the stock market but the revenue coming</text>
  <text start="741.6" dur="4.859">into the government that tax receipts</text>
  <text start="743.48" dur="4.99">guess what that&amp;#39;s a tough one to</text>
  <text start="746.459" dur="4.681">manipulate you you can be done but we</text>
  <text start="748.47" dur="5.91">can see right now we&amp;#39;re following the</text>
  <text start="751.14" dur="6.66">same exact pattern which means we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="754.38" dur="5.699">heading towards a major collapse now</text>
  <text start="757.8" dur="6">gold investment demand has surged to a</text>
  <text start="760.079" dur="5.82">record in the first half of 2016 and it</text>
  <text start="763.8" dur="6.84">overtook the previous record during the</text>
