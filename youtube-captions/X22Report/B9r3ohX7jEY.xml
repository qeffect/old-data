  <text start="41.59" dur="5.52">is the cover and economic collapse news</text>
  <text start="44.53" dur="5.4">brief let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="47.11" dur="5.79">collapse news now things out in Greece</text>
  <text start="49.93" dur="6.059">they are really starting to ramp up here</text>
  <text start="52.9" dur="5.49">we know that all of this debt that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="55.989" dur="4.981">been piled onto Greece is not helping</text>
  <text start="58.39" dur="4.32">whatsoever they&amp;#39;re back in a recession</text>
  <text start="60.97" dur="4.95">actually the whole country is collapsing</text>
  <text start="62.71" dur="6.48">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that the Greek farmers</text>
  <text start="65.92" dur="6.66">about 800 of them they marched on the</text>
  <text start="69.19" dur="5.099">agricultural ministry in Athens and they</text>
  <text start="72.58" dur="4.289">were beating police with Shepherds</text>
  <text start="74.289" dur="5.551">crooks and they&amp;#39;re saying this is</text>
  <text start="76.869" dur="5.31">absolutely ridiculous because you can</text>
  <text start="79.84" dur="5.01">raise the taxes you can cut the pension</text>
  <text start="82.179" dur="5.61">benefits all you want but this problem</text>
  <text start="84.85" dur="7.28">that we have is never going to go away</text>
  <text start="87.789" dur="8.521">because this is not the solution and</text>
  <text start="92.13" dur="5.98">they were throwing Tomatoes and the</text>
  <text start="96.31" dur="4.919">whole thing really got out of hand the</text>
  <text start="98.11" dur="5.52">police came out with tear gas and tried</text>
  <text start="101.229" dur="4.441">to push the people back and then they</text>
  <text start="103.63" dur="4.919">were joined by 10,000 of their</text>
  <text start="105.67" dur="5.61">compatriots as well as union members and</text>
  <text start="108.549" dur="5.191">they were all there and they were saying</text>
  <text start="111.28" dur="4.65">that we cannot let the government pass</text>
  <text start="113.74" dur="5.489">these catastrophic measures if they pass</text>
  <text start="115.93" dur="5.43">we&amp;#39;re going to have to become migrants</text>
  <text start="119.229" dur="3.271">and we can see the people are really</text>
  <text start="121.36" dur="3">starting to get to the point where</text>
  <text start="122.5" dur="4.049">they&amp;#39;re fed up and we&amp;#39;re seeing more and</text>
  <text start="124.36" dur="4.17">more of these riots and this is what</text>
  <text start="126.549" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re very nervous about this civil</text>
  <text start="128.53" dur="4.86">unrest because as each one of these</text>
  <text start="130.899" dur="4.711">countries collapses this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="133.39" dur="4.74">going to see this is why France is the</text>
  <text start="135.61" dur="6.45">model of taking away the rights becoming</text>
  <text start="138.13" dur="7.35">a complete police state where they can</text>
  <text start="142.06" dur="5.25">control these type of uprisings and they</text>
  <text start="145.48" dur="5.819">know this is going to spread throughout</text>
  <text start="147.31" dur="6.36">the world once this hits now here in the</text>
  <text start="151.299" dur="5.041">United States it is not getting any</text>
  <text start="153.67" dur="6.539">better are we seeing the riots just yet</text>
  <text start="156.34" dur="6.66">no not yet but they will be coming what</text>
  <text start="160.209" dur="3.701">we see right now is more and more jobs</text>
  <text start="163" dur="3.57">being</text>
  <text start="163.91" dur="6.09">removed from the united states on</text>
  <text start="166.57" dur="5.47">wednesday the united technology decided</text>
  <text start="170" dur="4.02">to reinforce both of these trends where</text>
  <text start="172.04" dur="5.25">they decided guess what we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="174.02" dur="7.14">eliminate around 2100 jobs from the</text>
  <text start="177.29" dur="7.79">carrier plant in indianapolis in favor</text>
  <text start="181.16" dur="7.71">of hiring foreign-born employees and</text>
  <text start="185.08" dur="7.9">these foreign-born workers will be hired</text>
  <text start="188.87" dur="7.41">in mexico and this is why we see</text>
  <text start="192.98" dur="5.55">manufacturing going down the tubes here</text>
  <text start="196.28" dur="4.83">in the united states actually the united</text>
  <text start="198.53" dur="5.16">states has very limited manufacturing</text>
  <text start="201.11" dur="4.02">left yes they&amp;#39;re still manufacturing</text>
  <text start="203.69" dur="5.49">plants but eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="205.13" dur="7.44">happen if and when the TPP passes we</text>
  <text start="209.18" dur="5.76">understand within that document they</text>
  <text start="212.57" dur="5.52">will be able to bring in foreign workers</text>
  <text start="214.94" dur="6.48">from other countries and pay them at the</text>
  <text start="218.09" dur="6.39">rate that their country pays them so the</text>
  <text start="221.42" dur="6.45">US worker will not be able to compete</text>
  <text start="224.48" dur="5.31">against these workers and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="227.87" dur="4.41">going to get worse and worse here in the</text>
  <text start="229.79" dur="4.35">united states what we&amp;#39;re seeing in the</text>
  <text start="232.28" dur="2.37">housing industry is that things are not</text>
  <text start="234.14" dur="2.64">getting better</text>
  <text start="234.65" dur="4.41">either we see that 43 percent of</text>
  <text start="236.78" dur="4.65">americans they are still renting all</text>
  <text start="239.06" dur="5.46">those people that lost their homes as of</text>
  <text start="241.43" dur="4.68">2008 most of them have not recovered</text>
  <text start="244.52" dur="5.22">they couldn&amp;#39;t purchase a new home and</text>
  <text start="246.11" dur="5.16">they are continually renting and this</text>
  <text start="249.74" dur="4.95">was coming from a new report which was</text>
  <text start="251.27" dur="5.31">released by Trulia that they found that</text>
  <text start="254.69" dur="4.29">the number of renters is continually</text>
  <text start="256.58" dur="5.55">increasing and the number of people who</text>
  <text start="258.98" dur="4.35">are owning homes is decreasing they</text>
  <text start="262.13" dur="3.63">should tell you something at this point</text>
  <text start="263.33" dur="3.45">that those people who are purchasing</text>
  <text start="265.76" dur="3.24">homes where they&amp;#39;re saying the real</text>
  <text start="266.78" dur="5.49">estate market is bouncing back it is</text>
  <text start="269" dur="6">fake phony and false it is hedge funds</text>
  <text start="272.27" dur="6.98">investment companies receiving the free</text>
  <text start="275" dur="4.25">money from the Fed it is foreign</text>
  <text start="279.4" dur="6.64">individuals corporations coming into the</text>
  <text start="283.19" dur="4.95">United States and looking to park their</text>
  <text start="286.04" dur="6.03">cash and they&amp;#39;re doing it in real estate</text>
  <text start="288.14" dur="6.75">so this economy right now is completely</text>
  <text start="292.07" dur="5.07">falling apart and it&amp;#39;s getting worse as</text>
  <text start="294.89" dur="2.72">time goes on and the US government</text>
  <text start="297.14" dur="2.839">realize</text>
  <text start="297.61" dur="4.91">is that they only have a certain window</text>
  <text start="299.979" dur="4.951">before this entire system falls apart</text>
  <text start="302.52" dur="5.26">we&amp;#39;re seeing that they&amp;#39;re provoking many</text>
  <text start="304.93" dur="8.19">countries around the globe North Korea</text>
  <text start="307.78" dur="7.289">Russia China Iran we&amp;#39;re at war in Syria</text>
  <text start="313.12" dur="4.139">right now we&amp;#39;re at war in Yemen right</text>
  <text start="315.069" dur="4.861">now we&amp;#39;re at war with Libya right now</text>
  <text start="317.259" dur="6.72">we&amp;#39;re at war with Ukraine with Russia</text>
  <text start="319.93" dur="7.32">right now I mean basically if you really</text>
  <text start="323.979" dur="6.84">look at this new step back world war has</text>
  <text start="327.25" dur="6.389">already started and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="330.819" dur="4.801">moving more military assets all over the</text>
  <text start="333.639" dur="5.161">place the US military right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="335.62" dur="6.15">deploying additional Patriot missiles to</text>
  <text start="338.8" dur="4.44">South Korea the missiles came from</text>
  <text start="341.77" dur="5.04">battery stationed at the Fort Bliss</text>
  <text start="343.24" dur="5.489">military base in Texas and they</text>
  <text start="346.81" dur="3.719">basically beefed up the ninety six pack</text>
  <text start="348.729" dur="3.93">twos and the pack three Patriot missiles</text>
  <text start="350.529" dur="5.461">which are a part of the two existing</text>
  <text start="352.659" dur="5.79">batteries on the Osan Air Base which is</text>
  <text start="355.99" dur="4.679">about 55 kilometers south of Seoul and</text>
  <text start="358.449" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re also thinking about putting in</text>
  <text start="360.669" dur="4.71">the terminal altitude area defense</text>
  <text start="362.529" dur="5.64">system which is the THAAD system inside</text>
  <text start="365.379" dur="4.831">South Korea all because they exploded a</text>
  <text start="368.169" dur="4.65">hydrogen bomb all because they launched</text>
  <text start="370.21" dur="4.739">a rocket which launched a satellite into</text>
  <text start="372.819" dur="3.541">space and of course the hydrogen bomb no</text>
  <text start="374.949" dur="2.58">one has proof that they actually did</text>
  <text start="376.36" dur="4.049">this there&amp;#39;s no radiation there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="377.529" dur="5.581">absolutely nothing all they saw was an</text>
  <text start="380.409" dur="3.991">earthquake and of course that could have</text>
  <text start="383.11" dur="3">been from anything it could have been</text>
  <text start="384.4" dur="2.609">natural of course they said it was</text>
  <text start="386.11" dur="4.47">unnatural</text>
  <text start="387.009" dur="4.951">for an earthquake to occur but what</text>
  <text start="390.58" dur="2.85">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="391.96" dur="3.929">getting prepared and ready and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="393.43" dur="4.079">lot of provoking a lot of propaganda</text>
  <text start="395.889" dur="5.43">coming out of the United States right</text>
  <text start="397.509" dur="5.4">now and then we see John Kerry he said</text>
  <text start="401.319" dur="5.4">something very interesting about Ukraine</text>
  <text start="402.909" dur="7.5">and he said that sanctions against</text>
  <text start="406.719" dur="6.961">Russia will continue until it&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="410.409" dur="7.23">implements all aspects of Ukraine peace</text>
  <text start="413.68" dur="9.03">agreement well let&amp;#39;s just think about</text>
  <text start="417.639" dur="9.45">this Russia has to implement the peace</text>
  <text start="422.71" dur="8.22">agreement that they created to stop the</text>
  <text start="427.089" dur="4.43">fighting in Ukraine so the south eastern</text>
  <text start="430.93" dur="5.639">people</text>
  <text start="431.519" dur="8.38">and Russia are waitin for Kiev to do</text>
  <text start="436.569" dur="6.42">their part which they haven&amp;#39;t they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="439.899" dur="5.07">continually stalling and John Kerry went</text>
  <text start="442.989" dur="5.22">on to say Russia has a simple choice</text>
  <text start="444.969" dur="6.18">fully implement the Minsk or continue to</text>
  <text start="448.209" dur="5.97">face economically damage sanctions this</text>
  <text start="451.149" dur="5.461">tells us right here they&amp;#39;re never going</text>
  <text start="454.179" dur="3.871">to fulfill the Minsk agreement and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="456.61" dur="5.089">talking about Kiev and the United States</text>
  <text start="458.05" dur="7.56">why because now they&amp;#39;re using propaganda</text>
  <text start="461.699" dur="5.59">to show that Russia didn&amp;#39;t fulfill the</text>
  <text start="465.61" dur="3.779">Minsk agreement and we are definitely</text>
  <text start="467.289" dur="3.99">going to see something happen in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="469.389" dur="3.78">and that&amp;#39;s going to be an offensive how</text>
  <text start="471.279" dur="5.521">they&amp;#39;re going to push this it could be</text>
  <text start="473.169" dur="5.941">any type of false flag at this point we</text>
  <text start="476.8" dur="5.579">see what&amp;#39;s happening out in Syria well</text>
  <text start="479.11" dur="5.909">the Turkish military they are shelling</text>
  <text start="482.379" dur="5.37">the Kurd fighters inside Syria so</text>
  <text start="485.019" dur="6.45">they&amp;#39;re firing from Turkey over the bird</text>
  <text start="487.749" dur="5.7">border into Syria and you know why</text>
  <text start="491.469" dur="4.141">they&amp;#39;re doing this they are provoking</text>
  <text start="493.449" dur="3.87">the Kurds they want them to fire back so</text>
  <text start="495.61" dur="7.979">they&amp;#39;ve been firing on the Kurds for</text>
  <text start="497.319" dur="8.49">three hours three hours to see if they</text>
  <text start="503.589" dur="5.49">can get some type of response because</text>
  <text start="505.809" dur="5.09">once the Kurds fire upon Turkey</text>
  <text start="509.079" dur="7.44">something big that they can really</text>
  <text start="510.899" dur="6.851">publicize the war is on and you have to</text>
  <text start="516.519" dur="4.861">remember the Kurds right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="517.75" dur="4.919">fighting the Islamic state but we can</text>
  <text start="521.38" dur="3.18">see what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>

  <text start="524.56" dur="6.93">trying to figure out a way for them to</text>
  <text start="527.29" dur="7.14">get into Syria to start the war we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="531.49" dur="6.149">getting information confirmation that</text>

  <text start="570.579" dur="6.271">for a major ground invasion they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="574.12" dur="5.67">saying that you wet that the Assad is</text>
  <text start="576.85" dur="8.28">completely a deluded to think that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="579.79" dur="7.919">ever going to win already we see Kerry</text>
  <text start="585.13" dur="6.09">and I mentioned this yesterday there is</text>

  <text start="633.91" dur="5.91">to confuse the situation and this is</text>
  <text start="636.91" dur="6.84">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now and we see</text>
  <text start="639.82" dur="7.829">already that a u.s. Department of State</text>
