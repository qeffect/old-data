  <text start="143.58" dur="6.54">it was three four hundred dollars less</text>
  <text start="148.019" dur="3.931">than what the price was you would run</text>

  <text start="228.449" dur="6.9">they&amp;#39;re talking about bail ins instead</text>
  <text start="231" dur="6.81">of bailouts and we a couple episodes ago</text>
  <text start="235.349" dur="5.97">we discussed the FDIC and Bank of</text>
  <text start="237.81" dur="6.48">England document and I notice in Forbes</text>
  <text start="241.319" dur="6.271">magazine and now in other publications</text>
  <text start="244.29" dur="7.379">they are coming out saying yes the new</text>
  <text start="247.59" dur="7.859">norm is what happened to Cyprus the new</text>
  <text start="251.669" dur="6.361">norm and I have all this linked on this</text>
  <text start="255.449" dur="4.53">page so if you want to even the FDIC and</text>
  <text start="258.03" dur="5.27">Bank of England document I have linked</text>
  <text start="259.979" dur="6.091">here too they will be no more bailouts</text>
  <text start="263.3" dur="4.869">we&amp;#39;re going to save the tax people you</text>
  <text start="266.07" dur="3.839">know taxpayer we&amp;#39;re not going to do this</text>
  <text start="268.169" dur="2.481">to them so instead we&amp;#39;re going to do a</text>
  <text start="269.909" dur="3.511">ballon</text>
  <text start="270.65" dur="4.69">those people in the bank we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="273.42" dur="5.04">going to take their money in the beylin</text>
  <text start="275.34" dur="5.34">just like the Cyprus people so really</text>
  <text start="278.46" dur="7.95">what&amp;#39;s the difference the difference is</text>
  <text start="280.68" dur="9.33">instead of the when it when it was taken</text>
  <text start="286.41" dur="6.66">from the tax paper tax people the people</text>
  <text start="290.01" dur="5.37">didn&amp;#39;t feel it when you go to your</text>
  <text start="293.07" dur="4.38">account and you have let&amp;#39;s say let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="295.38" dur="4.79">you have 200,000 and you look in it and</text>
  <text start="297.45" dur="6.96">only says a hundred thousand you feel it</text>
  <text start="300.17" dur="8.95">because if it took you 35 years to save</text>
  <text start="304.41" dur="11.15">up 200,000 it&amp;#39;s cut in half in one</text>
  <text start="309.12" dur="9">minute so the people will feel it and</text>
  <text start="315.56" dur="4.75">I&amp;#39;m saying this coming out more and more</text>
  <text start="318.12" dur="3.6">that they keep talking about balance and</text>
  <text start="320.31" dur="3.96">you know what happens when they</text>
  <text start="321.72" dur="6.24">continually talk about something they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="324.27" dur="7.65">getting prepared for it just like gun</text>
  <text start="327.96" dur="6.51">control they continually talking about</text>
  <text start="331.92" dur="5.73">gun control the bill has been shot down</text>
  <text start="334.47" dur="6.33">but President Obama is still out there</text>
  <text start="337.65" dur="7.55">that only a criminal would want to own a</text>
  <text start="340.8" dur="8.22">gun and he&amp;#39;s setting the stage for</text>
  <text start="345.2" dur="8.26">something terrible coming this is Plan B</text>
  <text start="349.02" dur="7.89">now I&amp;#39;ve been thinking and I truly</text>
  <text start="353.46" dur="7.02">believe they need an event to get the</text>
  <text start="356.91" dur="7.02">people back on the path and the event</text>
  <text start="360.48" dur="6.51">has to be big is the Boston bombing part</text>
  <text start="363.93" dur="4.65">of it i think it was supposed to be and</text>
  <text start="366.99" dur="4.59">they still make it they still might make</text>
  <text start="368.58" dur="7.56">it part of it but they are still</text>
  <text start="371.58" dur="7.05">pursuing going past the congress and not</text>
  <text start="376.14" dur="6.5">using the congress and making more</text>
  <text start="378.63" dur="9.42">executive orders plan B is in the works</text>
  <text start="382.64" dur="10.9">plan B is going to shake the American</text>
  <text start="388.05" dur="7.92">people they&amp;#39;ve already set the stage DHS</text>
  <text start="393.54" dur="5.46">is spying on Americans they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="395.97" dur="4.53">started labeling people domestic</text>
  <text start="399" dur="4.55">terrorists homegrown militants</text>
  <text start="400.5" dur="5.61">extremists gun loving people</text>
  <text start="403.55" dur="4.18">reports are coming out that these type</text>
  <text start="406.11" dur="5.67">of bossing bombings are going to be the</text>
  <text start="407.73" dur="8.52">new norm so they are setting the stage</text>
  <text start="411.78" dur="7.26">for something to come and you can see it</text>
  <text start="416.25" dur="5.37">you can see it by what it looked like in</text>
  <text start="419.04" dur="9.24">the streets when they had the troops in</text>
  <text start="421.62" dur="9.57">the streets now moving on it was an</text>
  <text start="428.28" dur="5.97">article today called technological</text>
  <text start="431.19" dur="5.37">terror could be on the horizon and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="434.25" dur="5.58">been talking about cyber attacks for</text>
  <text start="436.56" dur="7.14">quite a while now and this is a very</text>
  <text start="439.83" dur="6.93">interesting article and it&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="443.7" dur="5.01">every industry has been hit and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="446.76" dur="4.23">already seen you know compromised</text>
  <text start="448.71" dur="4.86">financial records disruption and power</text>
  <text start="450.99" dur="6.56">generation theft of top-secret military</text>
  <text start="453.57" dur="9.02">plans and even Google Facebook and Apple</text>
  <text start="457.55" dur="8.61">have been hit by intrusive attacks and</text>
  <text start="462.59" dur="7">they&amp;#39;re saying that a technical</text>
  <text start="466.16" dur="12.3">technological terror is on the horizon</text>
  <text start="469.59" dur="13.139">and it&amp;#39;s going to be very serious and</text>
  <text start="478.46" dur="7.72">they&amp;#39;re saying that we are unprepared to</text>
  <text start="482.729" dur="6.421">protect the network&amp;#39;s our military&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="486.18" dur="5.67">defense efforts are fragmented and our</text>
  <text start="489.15" dur="5.99">Department of Defense&amp;#39;s actions are not</text>
  <text start="491.85" dur="5.19">adequate to defend against this threat</text>
  <text start="495.14" dur="7.21">according to the recent report by the</text>
  <text start="497.04" dur="8.1">defense Science Board so basically what</text>
  <text start="502.35" dur="7.02">they&amp;#39;re saying is we don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="505.14" dur="9.75">ability to stop a sophisticated cyber</text>
  <text start="509.37" dur="7.59">attack and when you consider the report</text>
  <text start="514.89" dur="5.07">label the consequences of cyber threats</text>
  <text start="516.96" dur="7.199">potentially as serious as the nuclear</text>
  <text start="519.96" dur="9.81">threat of the Cold War everyone should</text>

  <text start="646.89" dur="8.069">brainwash them into becoming this</text>
  <text start="649.589" dur="7.921">civilian army and you can see that it is</text>
  <text start="654.959" dur="4.651">a civilian army it&amp;#39;s not for disaster</text>
  <text start="657.51" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s not for terrorists they have</text>
  <text start="659.61" dur="8.089">armored vehicles they look like soldiers</text>

  <text start="669.09" dur="7.66">so what did the SS or brown shirts what</text>
  <text start="673" dur="6.8">did they do they were the street thugs</text>
  <text start="676.75" dur="6.6">they intimidate timid ated brutalized</text>

  <text start="736.08" dur="9.34">they have it on the news so my question</text>
  <text start="741.13" dur="11.87">to everyone is history repeating itself</text>
  <text start="745.42" dur="15.29">are we seeing an armed forces that is</text>

  <text start="780.01" dur="4.32">ourselves feel better or should we</text>
  <text start="782.53" dur="3.84">really be looking at this and other</text>
  <text start="784.33" dur="5.01">people looking at this because if you</text>
  <text start="786.37" dur="6.54">look at the DHS it has been growing and</text>
