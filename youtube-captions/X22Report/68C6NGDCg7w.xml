  <text start="61.97" dur="5.009">September 6 2017 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="64.64" dur="4.589">episode is is that all coming to an end</text>
  <text start="66.979" dur="5.551">what else does the Cabal have up their</text>
  <text start="69.229" dur="5.311">sleeve let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="72.53" dur="4.5">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="74.54" dur="4.11">now something interesting happened and</text>
  <text start="77.03" dur="4.89">when we need to go back in time a little</text>
  <text start="78.65" dur="4.98">bit because back in time the deep state</text>
  <text start="81.92" dur="3.12">the Cabal that came out with his trunk</text>
  <text start="83.63" dur="3.72">dossier and it was passed along to</text>
  <text start="85.04" dur="4.62">McCain and many others about Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="87.35" dur="4.56">sexual escapades and it turned out to be</text>
  <text start="89.66" dur="4.26">all fake phony and false and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="91.91" dur="3.87">been trying to suppress this all along</text>
  <text start="93.92" dur="4.47">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all</text>
  <text start="95.78" dur="4.14">this right now investigators from the</text>
  <text start="98.39" dur="3.3">House Intelligence Committee they have</text>
  <text start="99.92" dur="4.89">issued subpoenas to the Department of</text>
  <text start="101.69" dur="5.789">Justice and the FBI related to the Trump</text>
  <text start="104.81" dur="4.41">dossier and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="107.479" dur="4.441">is that the Cabal the deep state the</text>
  <text start="109.22" dur="5.13">Democrats who are all involved in this</text>
  <text start="111.92" dur="5.28">well they me they may be a little</text>
  <text start="114.35" dur="5.91">worried right now because if the</text>
  <text start="117.2" dur="8">background materials are publicized well</text>
  <text start="120.26" dur="8.13">it could damage the whole Trump Russia</text>
  <text start="125.2" dur="5.259">collusion narrative and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="128.39" dur="3.93">this information getting out there and</text>
  <text start="130.459" dur="5.491">we know that there was a group called</text>
  <text start="132.32" dur="5.61">fusion GPS that funded the entire thing</text>
  <text start="135.95" dur="3.87">they were behind it we know it was</text>
  <text start="137.93" dur="3.92">passed along McCain was also involved</text>
  <text start="139.82" dur="4.59">and we see right now they are</text>
  <text start="141.85" dur="5.44">investigating all of this and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="144.41" dur="6.18">slowly starting to see is that the truth</text>
  <text start="147.29" dur="5.58">is starting to leak out here and there</text>
  <text start="150.59" dur="4.32">and they&amp;#39;re looking into all of these</text>
  <text start="152.87" dur="4.679">different things and remember a lot of</text>
  <text start="154.91" dur="4.38">these things were propaganda and while</text>
  <text start="157.549" dur="3.871">the kebab the deep state they were in</text>
  <text start="159.29" dur="4.56">control they were able to keep a lid on</text>
  <text start="161.42" dur="3.539">all of this but now that they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="163.85" dur="3.84">control and this is what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="164.959" dur="5.221">right now we&amp;#39;re seeing probably the end</text>
  <text start="167.69" dur="4.29">in sight because they&amp;#39;re losing control</text>
  <text start="170.18" dur="3.809">in the Middle East they&amp;#39;re not getting</text>
  <text start="171.98" dur="5.36">anywhere with North Korea we can see</text>
  <text start="173.989" dur="6.271">that people are being let go within the</text>
  <text start="177.34" dur="6.67">government area because remember they</text>
  <text start="180.26" dur="4.74">have been in deep in government and we</text>
  <text start="184.01" dur="2.66">can see a lot of people have been</text>
  <text start="185" dur="4.19">letting go a lot of people</text>
  <text start="186.67" dur="6.3">and what is happening is we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="189.19" dur="5.82">the end to this control but it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="192.97" dur="4.68">mean that we&amp;#39;re at the end just yet</text>
  <text start="195.01" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;re getting to that point and as we</text>
  <text start="197.65" dur="5.16">move to that area and this happens all</text>
  <text start="199.81" dur="4.17">the time people start to wonder people</text>
  <text start="202.81" dur="3.6">start to think people start to</text>
  <text start="203.98" dur="4.38">investigate and they say hey was this</text>
  <text start="206.41" dur="3.84">real or was this made-up let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="208.36" dur="4.5">investigate this let&amp;#39;s investigate</text>
  <text start="210.25" dur="4.77">Clinton Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s emails let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="212.86" dur="4.62">investigate the Trump dossier let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="215.02" dur="3.96">investigate all the propaganda and see</text>
  <text start="217.48" dur="3.99">what was real what was fake and this is</text>
  <text start="218.98" dur="4.53">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and this is</text>
  <text start="221.47" dur="4.35">going to continue on because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="223.51" dur="6.36">starting to see that the Cabal they are</text>
  <text start="225.82" dur="6.21">in trouble now we know that elections</text>
  <text start="229.87" dur="4.17">well they&amp;#39;re rigged I mean they can</text>
  <text start="232.03" dur="3.45">pretend all they want that no the</text>
  <text start="234.04" dur="4.68">elections aren&amp;#39;t rigged they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="235.48" dur="4.92">perfectly legit but they are rigged</text>
  <text start="238.72" dur="3.9">they brought illegal immigrants in</text>
  <text start="240.4" dur="4.83">there&amp;#39;s a lot of voters that they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="242.62" dur="4.41">account for informations been coming out</text>
  <text start="245.23" dur="3.72">that there&amp;#39;s millions of people that</text>
  <text start="247.03" dur="4.2">maybe they&amp;#39;re dead maybe they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="248.95" dur="4.02">exist maybe they voted twice and our</text>
  <text start="251.23" dur="5.039">election systems they&amp;#39;re kind of</text>
  <text start="252.97" dur="5.19">compromised so let&amp;#39;s think about how we</text>
  <text start="256.269" dur="4.201">can change this now we know they use a</text>
  <text start="258.16" dur="4.7">lot of computer systems to do the</text>
  <text start="260.47" dur="6.78">elections and we know from Bev Harris</text>
  <text start="262.86" dur="6.67">they are completely not reliable because</text>
  <text start="267.25" dur="4.74">she did a test and the person who was</text>
  <text start="269.53" dur="5.46">handling the elections they didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="271.99" dur="4.8">realize they didn&amp;#39;t even know that they</text>
  <text start="274.99" dur="3.33">were manipulated because they got their</text>
  <text start="276.79" dur="4.32">printout they thought everything was</text>
  <text start="278.32" dur="5.01">fine but in the background of course it</text>
  <text start="281.11" dur="6.02">was all manipulated this brings us to</text>
  <text start="283.33" dur="7.649">the blockchain which could be used for</text>
  <text start="287.13" dur="6.67">voting because it is a truth machine it</text>
  <text start="290.979" dur="5.821">keeps a ledger and right now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="293.8" dur="6.119">seeing is that they are actually looking</text>
  <text start="296.8" dur="5.94">at this they&amp;#39;re looking at a new form of</text>
  <text start="299.919" dur="5.131">liquid democracy in which voters can</text>
  <text start="302.74" dur="5.37">influence politics with just the tap of</text>
  <text start="305.05" dur="5.61">an app and it will record the</text>
  <text start="308.11" dur="4.17">transactions the votes and you can go</text>
  <text start="310.66" dur="4.319">back and look at all these transaction</text>
  <text start="312.28" dur="4.83">now the basic concept of liquid</text>
  <text start="314.979" dur="4.261">democracy is that voters can express</text>
  <text start="317.11" dur="3.15">their wishes on an issue directly or</text>
  <text start="319.24" dur="2.91">Delly</text>
  <text start="320.26" dur="3.84">their vote to someone else they think is</text>
  <text start="322.15" dur="4.26">better place to decide on their behalf</text>
  <text start="324.1" dur="5.82">and turn those delegates can also pass</text>
  <text start="326.41" dur="5.61">votes upward through the chain now again</text>
  <text start="329.92" dur="4.59">this is not all ironed out this is the</text>
  <text start="332.02" dur="4.92">beginning stages of this and we can see</text>
  <text start="334.51" dur="5.91">that this might be one way of</text>
  <text start="336.94" dur="4.98">controlling the votes and making sure</text>
  <text start="340.42" dur="2.31">that it&amp;#39;s all on the up-and-up because</text>
  <text start="341.92" dur="3.81">we have to understand that the</text>
  <text start="342.73" dur="5.34">blockchain is incorruptible no one can</text>
  <text start="345.73" dur="6.48">modify or subvert how the votes are</text>
  <text start="348.07" dur="7.23">stored and that&amp;#39;s vital for democracy so</text>
  <text start="352.21" dur="5.34">that is one good thing that might come</text>
  <text start="355.3" dur="5.25">out of the blockchain here now again the</text>
  <text start="357.55" dur="5.07">Cabal the central banks those in power</text>
  <text start="360.55" dur="3.69">today they don&amp;#39;t want this they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="362.62" dur="3.66">like the blockchain unless they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="364.24" dur="4.11">control if they are not in control and</text>
  <text start="366.28" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s completely decentralized they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="368.35" dur="5.25">like this whatsoever we see the top EU</text>
  <text start="371.71" dur="4.11">court they are threatening Poland</text>
  <text start="373.6" dur="4.74">Hungary the Czech Republic and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="375.82" dur="7.32">saying listen if you refuse to accept</text>
  <text start="378.34" dur="6.99">refugees we will sue and we see right</text>
  <text start="383.14" dur="4.02">now that a lot of countries are out</text>
  <text start="385.33" dur="4.47">there and they&amp;#39;re saying listen we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="387.16" dur="4.2">want to take on more refugees we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="389.8" dur="4.32">want to take on more of these</text>
  <text start="391.36" dur="4.53">individuals we want to control our</text>
  <text start="394.12" dur="3.75">borders we want to control what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="395.89" dur="5.73">doing here and we can see that the EU</text>
  <text start="397.87" dur="6.6">which is a non elected body they are</text>
  <text start="401.62" dur="5.04">pushing their agenda because what do</text>
  <text start="404.47" dur="4.47">they want they want them to do what they</text>
  <text start="406.66" dur="4.59">want now this is part of the Cabal the</text>
  <text start="408.94" dur="3.66">deep state the central bank and we can</text>
  <text start="411.25" dur="3.99">see right now if you don&amp;#39;t follow along</text>
  <text start="412.6" dur="5.54">with the non elected leaders they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="415.24" dur="7.08">like this we see South Korea right now</text>
  <text start="418.14" dur="6.94">they might be installing more terminal</text>
  <text start="422.32" dur="4.86">high altitude area defense system which</text>
  <text start="425.08" dur="3.51">is called the fad and it looks like</text>
  <text start="427.18" dur="4.2">because of what&amp;#39;s happening in North</text>
  <text start="428.59" dur="5.85">Korea they might be implementing these</text>
  <text start="431.38" dur="5.28">rocket systems now this is this has been</text>
  <text start="434.44" dur="4.38">brought in before and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="436.66" dur="4.5">push moon jae-in to accept even more</text>
  <text start="438.82" dur="4.02">this is exactly what the Cabal wants and</text>
  <text start="441.16" dur="4.71">this is what they&amp;#39;re pushing for now</text>
  <text start="442.84" dur="6.21">there is a report coming out of the</text>
  <text start="445.87" dur="5.07">corporate media saying that China might</text>
  <text start="449.05" dur="3.87">be closing their borders with North</text>
  <text start="450.94" dur="3.18">Korea now again we know why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="452.92" dur="2.73">doing this or trying to</text>
  <text start="454.12" dur="3.75">Vince&amp;#39;s that China&amp;#39;s about to do</text>
  <text start="455.65" dur="4.32">something and we need to look at this</text>
  <text start="457.87" dur="4.22">very closely because they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="459.97" dur="5.97">yes they&amp;#39;re gonna be closing parts of it</text>
  <text start="462.09" dur="6.07">in a certain area but there is the</text>
  <text start="465.94" dur="4.41">Korean friendship bridge and this is a</text>
  <text start="468.16" dur="5.28">row rail bridge that spans the Yellow</text>
  <text start="470.35" dur="4.92">River into North Korea and this accounts</text>
  <text start="473.44" dur="4.08">for 70 percent of the trade volume</text>
  <text start="475.27" dur="4.41">between the two countries this is going</text>
  <text start="477.52" dur="4.74">to remain open so it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="479.68" dur="5.37">closing maybe they&amp;#39;re closing something</text>
  <text start="482.26" dur="5.34">else but the main thoroughfare between</text>
  <text start="485.05" dur="5.55">the two countries is remaining open so</text>
  <text start="487.6" dur="5.37">who knows what they&amp;#39;re really doing but</text>
  <text start="490.6" dur="4.26">the corporate media is trying to put it</text>
  <text start="492.97" dur="3.479">out there that they&amp;#39;re actually you know</text>
  <text start="494.86" dur="3.48">preparing to do something and it looks</text>
  <text start="496.449" dur="3.151">like their main thoroughfare where</text>
  <text start="498.34" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re having all the trading and all</text>
  <text start="499.6" dur="5.01">their business 70% of this between the</text>
  <text start="501.55" dur="4.77">two countries that is remaining open now</text>
  <text start="504.61" dur="3.33">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is the corporate</text>
  <text start="506.32" dur="3">media is you know continually pushing</text>
  <text start="507.94" dur="3.77">the idea that we&amp;#39;re going to war with</text>
  <text start="509.32" dur="5.849">North Korea and they&amp;#39;re saying you know</text>
  <text start="511.71" dur="6.55">talk is out now we can&amp;#39;t have diplomacy</text>
  <text start="515.169" dur="5.461">that&amp;#39;s all gone and it looks like Trump</text>
  <text start="518.26" dur="4.5">he&amp;#39;s just playing games with the</text>
  <text start="520.63" dur="4.17">corporate media because what he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="522.76" dur="5.76">is that listen military action in North</text>
  <text start="524.8" dur="7.26">Korea well it&amp;#39;s not his first choice and</text>
  <text start="528.52" dur="5.49">again he uses the phrase we will see</text>
  <text start="532.06" dur="3.24">what happens and it looks like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="534.01" dur="3.75">playing with the corporate media because</text>
  <text start="535.3" dur="4.44">what they want him to do is they want</text>
  <text start="537.76" dur="3.06">him to say though you know North Korea</text>
  <text start="539.74" dur="2.91">crossed a red line</text>
  <text start="540.82" dur="4.019">we&amp;#39;re going into North Korea we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="542.65" dur="4.41">stop this and when he keeps doing is he</text>
  <text start="544.839" dur="4.111">keeps playing with them with all these</text>
  <text start="547.06" dur="3.87">different types of games like military</text>
  <text start="548.95" dur="4.02">action is not our first choice we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="550.93" dur="3.81">what happens we want trying to take care</text>
  <text start="552.97" dur="4.08">of this we&amp;#39;re gonna play sanctions on</text>
  <text start="554.74" dur="4.8">China which is which would destroy the</text>
  <text start="557.05" dur="4.32">US economy so what he&amp;#39;s doing right now</text>
  <text start="559.54" dur="3.87">we cease playing games and he&amp;#39;s moving</text>
  <text start="561.37" dur="3.3">this back and forth confusing the</text>
  <text start="563.41" dur="4.26">corporate media remember the corporate</text>
  <text start="564.67" dur="5.94">media is the mouthpiece for the deeps</text>
  <text start="567.67" dur="6.66">eight the Cabal now it looks like Russia</text>
  <text start="570.61" dur="5.94">they are becoming closer and closer with</text>
  <text start="574.33" dur="5.37">Japan it looks like they want to build a</text>
  <text start="576.55" dur="5.7">bridge between the Sokka Holland and the</text>
  <text start="579.7" dur="5.29">Hokkaido Islands and they want to</text>
  <text start="582.25" dur="4.81">connect the two Russia and Japan</text>
  <text start="584.99" dur="4.34">and this is going to be used for trade</text>
  <text start="587.06" dur="4.65">and we can see right now that they are</text>
  <text start="589.33" dur="4.81">basically becoming closer and closer</text>
  <text start="591.71" dur="4.62">together same with South Korea moon</text>
  <text start="594.14" dur="4.86">jae-in is moving closer and closer with</text>
  <text start="596.33" dur="4.74">Russia and China and basically what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="599" dur="3.84">happening is they are going to be siding</text>
  <text start="601.07" dur="4.5">with Russia and China and moving away</text>
  <text start="602.84" dur="3.57">from the United States Iran decided that</text>
  <text start="605.57" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re going to be closing their</text>
  <text start="606.41" dur="5.67">airspace for u.s. and Saudi aircraft and</text>
  <text start="609.17" dur="5.58">the reason for this is because of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="612.08" dur="4.38">happening in Yemen right now and Yemen</text>
  <text start="614.75" dur="4.68">is going through this incredible</text>
  <text start="616.46" dur="5.91">horrific crisis where the families women</text>
  <text start="619.43" dur="5.13">children men they&amp;#39;re all starving and it</text>
  <text start="622.37" dur="4.23">is absolutely terrible and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="624.56" dur="3.66">saying is that after the cruelties</text>
  <text start="626.6" dur="3.63">against Yemen and given the fact that</text>
  <text start="628.22" dur="3.6">the military system of a country is not</text>
  <text start="630.23" dur="3.78">separate from its government and trade</text>
  <text start="631.82" dur="3.99">system therefore we cannot show</text>
  <text start="634.01" dur="4.62">double-standard behavior towards the</text>
  <text start="635.81" dur="4.56">world and for instance when we say that</text>
  <text start="638.63" dur="3.84">the u.s. is a world arrogant power</text>
  <text start="640.37" dur="4.68">therefore we don&amp;#39;t allow the u.s.</text>
  <text start="642.47" dur="5.13">aircraft even Pastner planes to fly over</text>
  <text start="645.05" dur="5.13">the Islamic Republic of Iran because we</text>
  <text start="647.6" dur="4.82">are against its governance policies and</text>
  <text start="650.18" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re doing this with Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="652.42" dur="4.24">they&amp;#39;re doing this with the u.s. saying</text>
  <text start="654.95" dur="3.24">listen we&amp;#39;re closing our airspace</text>
  <text start="656.66" dur="3.03">because what is happening in Yemen and</text>
  <text start="658.19" dur="4.77">we know what&amp;#39;s happening in Yemen Saudi</text>
  <text start="659.69" dur="5.34">Arabia through the United States wants</text>
  <text start="662.96" dur="4.14">to get into Yemen they want the puppet</text>
  <text start="665.03" dur="4.53">government back they want their oil it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="667.1" dur="5.04">in a strategic location so they want all</text>
  <text start="669.56" dur="4.98">of that we see the UN came out with</text>
  <text start="672.14" dur="4.56">their report where it&amp;#39;s slamming the US</text>
  <text start="674.54" dur="5.94">and its allies and basically the</text>
  <text start="676.7" dur="6.72">conclusion of the UN says listen the</text>
  <text start="680.48" dur="4.98">United States and its allies well they</text>
  <text start="683.42" dur="6.57">have violated international law they</text>
  <text start="685.46" dur="7.08">failed to protect the civilians in Syria</text>
  <text start="689.99" dur="4.11">in Iraq and many other areas and</text>
  <text start="692.54" dur="3.57">remember they weren&amp;#39;t there to protect</text>
  <text start="694.1" dur="3.99">the civilians the Cabal was there to</text>
  <text start="696.11" dur="4.29">overthrow and put in puppet governments</text>
  <text start="698.09" dur="5.7">and they destroyed infrastructure they</text>
  <text start="700.4" dur="6.24">hit civilians and at this point the UN</text>
  <text start="703.79" dur="5.43">report is actually correct and Russian</text>
  <text start="706.64" dur="5.07">Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov he</text>
  <text start="709.22" dur="5.4">repeatedly stated that the US presence</text>
  <text start="711.71" dur="5.73">in Syria is illegal according to</text>
  <text start="714.62" dur="4.2">international law US forces and those of</text>
  <text start="717.44" dur="3.93">their allies have</text>
  <text start="718.82" dur="6.6">been authorized by the UN to conduct any</text>
  <text start="721.37" dur="8.07">military action on Syrian soil Russia</text>
  <text start="725.42" dur="7.38">and Iran have been invited in by the</text>
  <text start="729.44" dur="6.68">President of Syria the United States and</text>
  <text start="732.8" dur="6.15">the Allies invaded that country doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="736.12" dur="4">matter if there&amp;#39;s terrorists in there it</text>
  <text start="738.95" dur="3.36">doesn&amp;#39;t matter because think about it</text>
  <text start="740.12" dur="4.08">switch it around if there were</text>
  <text start="742.31" dur="4.92">terrorists in this country with the</text>
  <text start="744.2" dur="5.82">United States be okay with serene forces</text>
  <text start="747.23" dur="4.71">coming in without permission to fight</text>
  <text start="750.02" dur="4.98">the terrorists no they would not</text>
  <text start="751.94" dur="6.09">basically what they did was invade</text>
  <text start="755" dur="5.49">another country and the whole community</text>
  <text start="758.03" dur="5.1">except for Russia and China and Syria</text>
  <text start="760.49" dur="5.22">and Iran everyone else seems to be fine</text>
  <text start="763.13" dur="5.43">with it they broke international law and</text>
  <text start="765.71" dur="5.07">no one is questioning that why because</text>
  <text start="768.56" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re afraid but things are changing</text>
  <text start="770.78" dur="3.72">now Russia and China they&amp;#39;re detaching</text>
  <text start="773.48" dur="3.03">themselves from the dollar</text>
  <text start="774.5" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re detaching themselves where they</text>
  <text start="776.51" dur="3.72">can be independent once you become</text>
  <text start="777.95" dur="3.09">independent financially you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="780.23" dur="2.97">afraid anymore</text>
  <text start="781.04" dur="5.21">and you can speak out against that power</text>
  <text start="783.2" dur="5.13">because the sanctions they do nothing</text>
  <text start="786.25" dur="4">smaller countries where the sanctions</text>
  <text start="788.33" dur="4.31">would do something they stay very quiet</text>
  <text start="790.25" dur="5.4">and we can see that things are slowly</text>
  <text start="792.64" dur="5.95">changing we see Russia is setting up</text>
  <text start="795.65" dur="5.58">deconfliction zones north of Aleppo and</text>
  <text start="798.59" dur="4.02">as they continually move throughout</text>
  <text start="801.23" dur="3.39">Syria they&amp;#39;re setting up these</text>
  <text start="802.61" dur="4.95">deconfliction zone so they can control</text>
  <text start="804.62" dur="5.73">the entire area they put their military</text>
  <text start="807.56" dur="4.89">police in position and they protect the</text>
  <text start="810.35" dur="4.8">area they protect the civilians and they</text>
  <text start="812.45" dur="5.7">protect it from yes the moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="815.15" dur="4.89">the Islamic state and al-qaeda the UN is</text>
  <text start="818.15" dur="4.29">out there and they&amp;#39;re saying listen the</text>
  <text start="820.04" dur="5.85">Syrian opposition medics must accept it</text>
  <text start="822.44" dur="7.83">is not won the war in Syria so already</text>
  <text start="825.89" dur="6.81">the UN is saying listen you&amp;#39;re done the</text>
  <text start="830.27" dur="5.94">moderate rebels the Islamic state al</text>
  <text start="832.7" dur="6.48">Qaeda it&amp;#39;s all done the Syrians the</text>
  <text start="836.21" dur="6.12">Russians they have gained control of the</text>
  <text start="839.18" dur="6.2">country and the serene opposition they</text>
  <text start="842.33" dur="5.4">must accept defeat at this point so</text>
  <text start="845.38" dur="6.13">everything that the cabal has been</text>
  <text start="847.73" dur="5.03">working for it is coming to an end all</text>
  <text start="851.51" dur="3.92">they have left</text>
  <text start="852.76" dur="5.25">right now is I think Ukraine and North</text>
  <text start="855.43" dur="5.37">Korea North Korea right now is the hot</text>
  <text start="858.01" dur="4.71">spot and we can see that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="860.8" dur="4.53">playing this up quite a bit and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="862.72" dur="4.35">gonna push this very very hard and we</text>
  <text start="865.33" dur="3.75">can see already is because you already</text>
  <text start="867.07" dur="5.31">that Trump is really downplaying this</text>
  <text start="869.08" dur="7.17">right now and we can see by everything</text>
  <text start="872.38" dur="7.82">that&amp;#39;s been going on the Cabal it looks</text>
  <text start="876.25" dur="8.91">like their time is coming to an end and</text>
  <text start="880.2" dur="7.39">their ability to create war might be</text>
  <text start="885.16" dur="5.4">coming to an end right now unless they</text>
  <text start="887.59" dur="4.35">do something huge and this is what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="890.56" dur="3.72">been looking at this is what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="891.94" dur="4.65">observing because right now coming out</text>
  <text start="894.28" dur="5.69">of site intelligence group and we know</text>
  <text start="896.59" dur="6.39">this is a propaganda peach Rita Katz</text>
  <text start="899.97" dur="5.92">handles this they work with the Islamic</text>
  <text start="902.98" dur="4.62">state they work with Mossad and we can</text>
  <text start="905.89" dur="4.47">see right now the Islamic state is out</text>
  <text start="907.6" dur="4.35">there and is anyone really scared of the</text>
  <text start="910.36" dur="4.14">Islamic state they&amp;#39;re pretty much done</text>
  <text start="911.95" dur="4.29">done for but they&amp;#39;re still putting up</text>
  <text start="914.5" dur="4.65">messages that they&amp;#39;re planning to poison</text>
  <text start="916.24" dur="4.68">the supermarket food with cyanide to all</text>
  <text start="919.15" dur="4.02">the Western countries I mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="920.92" dur="4.86">just pushing out propaganda trying to</text>
  <text start="923.17" dur="4.32">scare people in Europe people in Russia</text>
  <text start="925.78" dur="3.96">people in the United States to make</text>
  <text start="927.49" dur="5.07">everyone believe that they&amp;#39;re coming to</text>
  <text start="929.74" dur="4.71">get us but at this point they are really</text>
  <text start="932.56" dur="6.54">done for right now so what are we seeing</text>
  <text start="934.45" dur="7.68">we are seeing basically the end of the</text>
  <text start="939.1" dur="6.6">deep state the Cabal right now and they</text>
  <text start="942.13" dur="5.52">are slowly but surely losing power more</text>
  <text start="945.7" dur="4.8">and more information is coming out into</text>
  <text start="947.65" dur="4.68">the open we can see at this point that</text>
  <text start="950.5" dur="3.6">the Fed there there are those</text>
  <text start="952.33" dur="4.5">individuals that are leaving right now</text>
  <text start="954.1" dur="5.1">because they realize it&amp;#39;s time to get</text>
  <text start="956.83" dur="6.12">out and I believe that we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="959.2" dur="6.45">many more individuals either get fired</text>
  <text start="962.95" dur="5.22">either get let go or just resign</text>
  <text start="965.65" dur="5.16">themselves because they see the writing</text>
  <text start="968.17" dur="4.74">is on the wall now we&amp;#39;re still heading</text>
  <text start="970.81" dur="4.4">for this major collapse we&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="972.91" dur="5.07">heading to a complete and utter disaster</text>
  <text start="975.21" dur="5.11">we&amp;#39;re still moving to the death of the</text>
  <text start="977.98" dur="4.5">dollar that has not changed whatsoever</text>
  <text start="980.32" dur="4.56">and as we move throughout this year</text>
  <text start="982.48" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;re gonna see more economic indicators</text>
  <text start="984.88" dur="3.3">deteriorate and the</text>
  <text start="986.71" dur="4.02">or you know it we&amp;#39;re gonna come to a</text>
  <text start="988.18" dur="5.01">certain point in time where everything</text>
  <text start="990.73" dur="4.14">just completely falls apart and I know</text>
  <text start="993.19" dur="3.75">people have been writing in Tommy this</text>
  <text start="994.87" dur="4.83">is why we&amp;#39;re getting this is why they</text>
  <text start="996.94" dur="6">basically started up allowing the police</text>
  <text start="999.7" dur="5.19">to purchase military assets because we</text>
  <text start="1002.94" dur="2.88">know what&amp;#39;s going to happen we know that</text>
  <text start="1004.89" dur="3.319">people are going to be shocked I mean</text>
  <text start="1005.82" dur="6.3">think about it in Texas and in Florida</text>
