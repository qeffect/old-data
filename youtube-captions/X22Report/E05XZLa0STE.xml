  <text start="49.67" dur="6.06">geopolitical news now out in Ukraine a</text>
  <text start="52.4" dur="6.089">lot of strange things are occurring back</text>

  <text start="58.489" dur="4.41">Forces they attack many different towns</text>
  <text start="60.71" dur="4.019">in Donetsk and Lugansk and this has</text>

  <text start="73.58" dur="5.88">mole mobile rocket units and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="77.119" dur="6.42">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="79.46" dur="5.939">the OSCE is looking at different</text>
  <text start="83.539" dur="6.031">discrepancies in serial numbers of the</text>
  <text start="85.399" dur="6.541">t-64 and t-72 tanks in storage and the</text>

  <text start="99.47" dur="5.67">mins to agreement and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="102.02" dur="6.84">saying is there is evidence that the UFA</text>
  <text start="105.14" dur="6.66">is planning a possible offensive in the</text>
  <text start="108.86" dur="4.619">coming spring or summer months and we</text>
  <text start="111.8" dur="4.5">have to think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="113.479" dur="5.34">the Kiev government is losing the</text>
  <text start="116.3" dur="4.799">support of the people the entire economy</text>
  <text start="118.819" dur="5.16">is collapsing their currency is</text>
  <text start="121.099" dur="5.041">collapsing they have no industry at this</text>
  <text start="123.979" dur="3.95">point in time and the central bankers</text>
  <text start="126.14" dur="5.069">then get what they paid for and</text>
  <text start="127.929" dur="5.351">poroshenko is has received orders from</text>
  <text start="131.209" dur="4.831">the US government and the central</text>
  <text start="133.28" dur="5.459">bankers saying no we need you to do</text>
  <text start="136.04" dur="5.61">something at this point and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="138.739" dur="5.941">starting to see that as we move into the</text>
  <text start="141.65" dur="4.5">spring and summer a lot of things are</text>
  <text start="144.68" dur="3.12">taking place we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="146.15" dur="4.71">military assets being moved in different</text>
  <text start="147.8" dur="6.75">directions the OSCE can&amp;#39;t again can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="150.86" dur="6.12">account for certain items and poroshenko</text>
  <text start="154.55" dur="4.29">and Yatsenyuk have been calling for the</text>
  <text start="156.98" dur="5.46">reunification of the southeastern area</text>
  <text start="158.84" dur="5.37">and Crimea and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="162.44" dur="3.81">that these indicators are</text>
  <text start="164.21" dur="6.42">pointing to something happening very</text>
  <text start="166.25" dur="7.41">very soon now the u.s. is in talks with</text>
  <text start="170.63" dur="5.46">Australia because they&amp;#39;re planning to</text>
  <text start="173.66" dur="5.79">increase the presence of the long-range</text>
  <text start="176.09" dur="6.53">strike bombers in Australia and it looks</text>
  <text start="179.45" dur="8.15">like they&amp;#39;re looking to bring in bombers</text>
  <text start="182.62" dur="7.81">tankers all into this area because of</text>
  <text start="187.6" dur="7.53">China because of what&amp;#39;s happening in the</text>
  <text start="190.43" dur="8.37">Pacific so we see the US central bankers</text>
  <text start="195.13" dur="6.22">provoking China in the Pacific preparing</text>
  <text start="198.8" dur="5.25">and getting ready with military assets</text>
  <text start="201.35" dur="5.55">bringing in different bombers setting up</text>
  <text start="204.05" dur="5.16">missile shields we see it happening in</text>
  <text start="206.9" dur="5.37">the Middle East we see it happen in</text>
  <text start="209.21" dur="7.65">Eastern Europe and this is all in</text>
  <text start="212.27" dur="7.5">preparation for war now they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="216.86" dur="4.95">do whatever they have to to push war and</text>
  <text start="219.77" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re going to continually do this</text>
  <text start="221.81" dur="5.04">until they get war started because they</text>
  <text start="224.81" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t want to be blamed for what&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="226.85" dur="5.64">to happen and that is a collapse of the</text>
  <text start="229.25" dur="5.94">entire economic system so they need</text>
  <text start="232.49" dur="6.66">something to cover it up so we see the</text>
  <text start="235.19" dur="7.56">u.s. is making their move in Somalia the</text>
  <text start="239.15" dur="5.04">US military launched an air strike in</text>
  <text start="242.75" dur="4.38">somalia over the weekend that would</text>
  <text start="244.19" dur="4.23">killed about 150 people and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="247.13" dur="3.9">saying that it was the terrorist group</text>
  <text start="248.42" dur="5.61">al-shabaab it was a training camp about</text>
  <text start="251.03" dur="6.24">112 220 miles north of the country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="254.03" dur="5.91">capital of Mogadishu and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="257.27" dur="5.88">that we had to do this because it was</text>
  <text start="259.94" dur="6.93">self-defense now did they actually have</text>
  <text start="263.15" dur="6.6">evidence that this was going on there</text>
  <text start="266.87" dur="5.7">well according to Peter Cook the</text>
  <text start="269.75" dur="4.77">pentagon spokesman they&amp;#39;re really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="272.57" dur="5.91">have any evidence they just knew it was</text>
  <text start="274.52" dur="5.64">it was imminent threat and they had some</text>
  <text start="278.48" dur="3.93">idea that it was some type of training</text>
  <text start="280.16" dur="4.88">camp and what they call terrorists are</text>
  <text start="282.41" dur="5.91">normally the people who are rising up</text>
  <text start="285.04" dur="6.34">fighting the puppet regimes we see this</text>
  <text start="288.32" dur="4.98">in Ukraine for example once the puppet</text>
  <text start="291.38" dur="4.23">regime was put into place into Ukraine</text>
  <text start="293.3" dur="3.869">all those people fighting against the</text>
  <text start="295.61" dur="2.5">puppet regime were terrorists they</text>
  <text start="297.169" dur="4.151">started aunty</text>
  <text start="298.11" dur="8.07">terrorism operations in Libya in Yemen</text>
  <text start="301.32" dur="6.59">in Iraq what we see there is once they</text>
  <text start="306.18" dur="4.8">put the puppet governments into place</text>
  <text start="307.91" dur="6.64">anyone who opposes the government is</text>
  <text start="310.98" dur="6.42">called al Qaeda the terrace because</text>
  <text start="314.55" dur="4.83">remember under the legislation the US</text>
  <text start="317.4" dur="4.68">was allowed to go after al-qaeda in any</text>
  <text start="319.38" dur="5.34">country without any other type of</text>
  <text start="322.08" dur="5.22">authorization so they just called them</text>
  <text start="324.72" dur="8.01">al Qaeda they call them terrorists they</text>
  <text start="327.3" dur="7.44">used the 2001 legislation to go after Al</text>
  <text start="332.73" dur="4.02">Shabaab because they&amp;#39;re in line with al</text>
  <text start="334.74" dur="5.64">Qaeda so they made the link right there</text>
  <text start="336.75" dur="7.97">and again we have to be very careful of</text>
  <text start="340.38" dur="7.95">who they&amp;#39;re calling terrorists because</text>
  <text start="344.72" dur="8.16">normally when they say terrace it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="348.33" dur="9.99">people rising up and on the flip side</text>
  <text start="352.88" dur="9.64">they use terrorists to overthrow elected</text>
  <text start="358.32" dur="6.84">governments like in Syria they have al</text>
  <text start="362.52" dur="6.06">Qaeda they have the Islamic state they</text>
  <text start="365.16" dur="5.94">have L Nostra they use these terrorist</text>
  <text start="368.58" dur="4.44">groups they pay them because they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="371.1" dur="3.03">paid mercenaries to overthrow the</text>
  <text start="373.02" dur="3.54">governor and once the government is</text>
  <text start="374.13" dur="5.28">overthrown anyone that opposes them they</text>
  <text start="376.56" dur="4.8">are now the keris there al Qaeda they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="379.41" dur="3.72">the Islamic state because those are the</text>
  <text start="381.36" dur="3.63">people who are fighting against the</text>
  <text start="383.13" dur="5.64">puppet government and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="384.99" dur="6.15">seeing in many different areas and of</text>
  <text start="388.77" dur="5.52">course the u.s. is saying that they did</text>
  <text start="391.14" dur="6.39">this because it was self-defense now the</text>
  <text start="394.29" dur="5.4">Hootie&amp;#39;s they are on their way to Saudi</text>
  <text start="397.53" dur="5.07">Arabia to discuss ending the war in</text>
  <text start="399.69" dur="5.19">Yemen and this is coming from to who the</text>
  <text start="402.6" dur="5.19">officials saying that yes Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="404.88" dur="4.59">is looking to have peace right now are</text>
  <text start="407.79" dur="3.6">they really looking to have peace no</text>
  <text start="409.47" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re trying to make a deal where the</text>
  <text start="411.39" dur="4.5">puppet government comes back into power</text>
  <text start="413.82" dur="3.51">and they want the Hootie&amp;#39;s to accept</text>
  <text start="415.89" dur="3.15">this this is most likely what the talks</text>
  <text start="417.33" dur="4.44">are going to be about it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="419.04" dur="5.97">very one-sided just like they are with</text>
  <text start="421.77" dur="5.73">Syria and the opposition and Assad</text>
  <text start="425.01" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re very one-sided Assad step down</text>
  <text start="427.5" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re going to do the same thing in</text>
  <text start="429.54" dur="4.49">Yemen and when</text>
  <text start="431.49" dur="5.85">don&amp;#39;t agree the fighting will continue</text>
  <text start="434.03" dur="6.91">we see the operation to liberate Mosul</text>
  <text start="437.34" dur="6.449">in Iraq is already underway and remember</text>
  <text start="440.94" dur="5.19">the air the Iraqi army has been has been</text>
  <text start="443.789" dur="4.261">moving troops closer and closer to</text>
  <text start="446.13" dur="5.189">muscle we&amp;#39;ve had the warning about the</text>
  <text start="448.05" dur="5.82">damn that might come down we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="451.319" dur="6.57">see because remember the Iraqi forces</text>
  <text start="453.87" dur="6.96">are pushing forward the u.s. is staying</text>
  <text start="457.889" dur="6.96">back and their advisors are helping them</text>
  <text start="460.83" dur="7.41">and if the Iraqi forces don&amp;#39;t do what</text>
  <text start="464.849" dur="5.19">they say and kind of steer clear of the</text>
  <text start="468.24" dur="5.79">proxy armies they&amp;#39;re trying to protect</text>
  <text start="470.039" dur="6.181">the u.s. might blow that damn to cover</text>
  <text start="474.03" dur="3.66">up what is really going on in there</text>
  <text start="476.22" dur="4.74">because they don&amp;#39;t want what happened in</text>
  <text start="477.69" dur="5.219">Ramadi to happen M Azul so we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="480.96" dur="6.829">to have to watch that situation very</text>
  <text start="482.909" dur="8.421">carefully now we see turkey they are</text>
  <text start="487.789" dur="7.271">clamping down on freedom of speech and</text>
  <text start="491.33" dur="6.55">it seems that they&amp;#39;ve seized control of</text>
  <text start="495.06" dur="7.43">another news agency and this makes two</text>
  <text start="497.88" dur="7.469">of them and they don&amp;#39;t want the press</text>
  <text start="502.49" dur="5.739">reporting on what&amp;#39;s really going on in</text>
  <text start="505.349" dur="6.211">Turkey and I think what&amp;#39;s happening at</text>
  <text start="508.229" dur="6.451">this point is that the u.s. the</text>
  <text start="511.56" dur="5.099">coalition forces Turkey they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="514.68" dur="3.57">prepared for this major offensive and</text>
  <text start="516.659" dur="6.18">they don&amp;#39;t want anything leaked out of</text>
  <text start="518.25" dur="6.54">their next event that is coming and I</text>
  <text start="522.839" dur="4.62">think everything is originating in</text>
  <text start="524.79" dur="5.19">Turkey and they gave strict orders to</text>
  <text start="527.459" dur="5.581">you on right now to basically clamp down</text>
  <text start="529.98" dur="6.09">and shut up the opposition party to keep</text>
  <text start="533.04" dur="6.12">the newspaper quiet take control of the</text>
  <text start="536.07" dur="4.35">situation and block any type of news</text>
  <text start="539.16" dur="3.33">that is coming out of there that might</text>
  <text start="540.42" dur="5.43">lead to people thinking that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="542.49" dur="5.9">behind any of this and it seems like</text>
  <text start="545.85" dur="4.859">they&amp;#39;re putting this into overdrive and</text>
  <text start="548.39" dur="5.889">freedom of speech has completely</text>
  <text start="550.709" dur="5.431">deteriorated since 23rd since 2013</text>
  <text start="554.279" dur="4.62">according to a lot of the monitoring</text>
  <text start="556.14" dur="5.04">groups and it is accelerating in this</text>
  <text start="558.899" dur="5.581">area now as we know turkey is</text>
  <text start="561.18" dur="4.349">continually firing into Syria they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="564.48" dur="4.289">keeping the corridor</text>
  <text start="565.529" dur="4.92">open they&amp;#39;re hitting different areas to</text>
  <text start="568.769" dur="4.56">keep the Syrian Armed Forces and the</text>
  <text start="570.449" dur="4.351">Russian forces away from this corridor</text>
  <text start="573.329" dur="4.8">because they want to continually supply</text>
  <text start="574.8" dur="7.17">their terrorist groups and we know that</text>
  <text start="578.129" dur="6.241">Russia has been supplying the US and the</text>
  <text start="581.97" dur="3.989">coalition forces evidence of turkey</text>
  <text start="584.37" dur="5.579">shelling into this area with satellite</text>
  <text start="585.959" dur="6.75">imagery with video showing where it is</text>
  <text start="589.949" dur="7.38">coming from so the United States decided</text>
  <text start="592.709" dur="6.75">to look into this and they have looked</text>
  <text start="597.329" dur="4.95">at all the different types of</text>
  <text start="599.459" dur="5.701">information and they&amp;#39;ve come to the</text>
  <text start="602.279" dur="5.28">conclusion that there is absolutely no</text>
  <text start="605.16" dur="5.52">proof that turkey is shelling into this</text>
  <text start="607.559" dur="6.181">area whatsoever they said we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="610.68" dur="6.3">reports we looked at them and we&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="613.74" dur="5.49">an investigation into this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="616.98" dur="3.75">really not shelling anyone across the</text>
  <text start="619.23" dur="3.959">border we don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="620.73" dur="7.019">here why people are saying they are we</text>
  <text start="623.189" dur="7.44">don&amp;#39;t see it and remember Russia put</text>
  <text start="627.749" dur="6.801">forth a UN resolution about turkey</text>
  <text start="630.629" dur="8.851">shelling into Syria and they wanted this</text>
  <text start="634.55" dur="7.719">they wanted the UN to look at it to say</text>
  <text start="639.48" dur="5.219">that this was against international law</text>
  <text start="642.269" dur="4.951">and the United States stepped in and</text>
  <text start="644.699" dur="4.95">vetoed it and this should tell you</text>
  <text start="647.22" dur="6.059">everything at this point that they know</text>
  <text start="649.649" dur="4.86">exactly what is going on they know what</text>
  <text start="653.279" dur="4.05">turkey is doing because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="654.509" dur="5.221">instructing them in what to do of course</text>
  <text start="657.329" dur="4.171">behind the scenes so they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="659.73" dur="3.839">implicated in any of this and this is</text>
  <text start="661.5" dur="7.579">why they came out and said yeah we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="663.569" dur="9.151">see any of this and of course as we know</text>
  <text start="669.079" dur="7.48">they don&amp;#39;t see any of it because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="672.72" dur="6.059">planning for this major event that is</text>
  <text start="676.559" dur="4.47">coming soon I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="678.779" dur="4.53">to be tomorrow the next day but I do</text>
  <text start="681.029" dur="4.321">know within the next couple of weeks or</text>
  <text start="683.309" dur="4.95">a month or so we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="685.35" dur="5.909">something very big happening because</text>
  <text start="688.259" dur="6.63">they need to continue with their war</text>
  <text start="691.259" dur="5.58">remember they never stopped and what</text>
  <text start="694.889" dur="4.531">they&amp;#39;re doing their goal is always the</text>
  <text start="696.839" dur="5.311">same if a plan doesn&amp;#39;t work out</text>
  <text start="699.42" dur="5.31">they stop they recalibrate they we work</text>
  <text start="702.15" dur="5.88">the plan and then they go forth for the</text>
