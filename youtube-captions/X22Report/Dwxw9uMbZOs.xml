  <text start="246.06" dur="6.48">period usually it&amp;#39;s around 1500 usually</text>
  <text start="250.02" dur="4.47">double what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now now</text>

  <text start="274.98" dur="4.83">rates they&amp;#39;re pushing the idea that we</text>
  <text start="277.77" dur="4.17">cannot allow these people to have cash</text>
  <text start="279.81" dur="4.29">now they&amp;#39;re pushing it in Greece at this</text>
  <text start="281.94" dur="5.01">point just like we saw in Cyprus with</text>
  <text start="284.1" dur="7.11">capital controls bank holiday and a</text>

  <text start="291.21" dur="7.02">eligible for balance we see already they</text>
  <text start="294.45" dur="5.64">introduced stricter capital controls</text>
  <text start="298.23" dur="6.96">not letting people take cash out of the</text>

  <text start="320.22" dur="5.61">individuals from getting their money out</text>
  <text start="323.09" dur="5.38">they don&amp;#39;t want a repeat of what</text>
  <text start="325.83" dur="5.04">happened in Greece when they knew the</text>
  <text start="328.47" dur="3.93">country was headed in the wrong</text>
  <text start="330.87" dur="3.36">direction which it&amp;#39;s still headed in the</text>
  <text start="332.4" dur="6.39">wrong direction people ran to the bank</text>

  <text start="338.79" dur="6.36">see banks the Fed the government come</text>
  <text start="342.54" dur="5.9">out and let us know that they need to</text>
  <text start="345.15" dur="6.05">start limiting the cash withdrawals and</text>
  <text start="348.44" dur="5.26">of course this is for your benefit</text>
  <text start="351.2" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;d rather you purchase everything</text>

  <text start="364.59" dur="7.08">cannot release a certain number of funds</text>
  <text start="368.58" dur="5.34">to the public but don&amp;#39;t worry everything</text>
  <text start="371.67" dur="4.65">is fine you can make as many purchase as</text>
  <text start="373.92" dur="4.76">you want using your debit card this is</text>
  <text start="376.32" dur="5.82">the direction they are headed right now</text>
  <text start="378.68" dur="7.6">the central banks they&amp;#39;re bracing for a</text>
  <text start="382.14" dur="7.98">rolling series of crisis they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="386.28" dur="5.79">prepared for what is about to hit now of</text>
  <text start="390.12" dur="4.26">course they&amp;#39;re the cause of it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="392.07" dur="4.92">the ones that created all this the debt</text>
  <text start="394.38" dur="7.29">right now cannot be sustained and hpc is</text>
  <text start="396.99" dur="8.4">out there saying from our metrics we are</text>
  <text start="401.67" dur="6.63">already in a global recession they</text>
  <text start="405.39" dur="6.57">produced a chart which is denominated in</text>
  <text start="408.3" dur="7.11">u.s. dollars and they&amp;#39;re saying from</text>
  <text start="411.96" dur="6.9">this chart we&amp;#39;re already in a recession</text>
  <text start="415.41" dur="8.34">a global recession and it&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="418.86" dur="8.7">worse as time goes on they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="423.75" dur="5.64">that global trade is also declining at</text>
  <text start="427.56" dur="4.59">an alarming pace according to the latest</text>
  <text start="429.39" dur="7.53">data available in June the year-on-year</text>
  <text start="432.15" dur="7.56">is negative eight point four percent to</text>
  <text start="436.92" dur="7.92">find periods of equivalent declines we</text>
  <text start="439.71" dur="7.38">only really find recessionary periods US</text>
  <text start="444.84" dur="5.55">dollars is already negative to the tune</text>
  <text start="447.09" dur="6.87">of 37 trillion or negative three point</text>
  <text start="450.39" dur="8.67">four percent that is we are already in a</text>
  <text start="453.96" dur="7.26">dollar recession so is anything going to</text>
  <text start="459.06" dur="5.73">approve improve here no absolutely not</text>
  <text start="461.22" dur="8.76">as time goes on it&amp;#39;s going to get worse</text>
  <text start="464.79" dur="9.42">and worse and there&amp;#39;s no way out and the</text>
  <text start="469.98" dur="6.93">only way out according to the central</text>
  <text start="474.21" dur="5.43">bank&amp;#39;s is to go after the people&amp;#39;s money</text>
  <text start="476.91" dur="5.88">and they&amp;#39;ve done this with Obamacare</text>
  <text start="479.64" dur="4.74">would FATCA now if those people who</text>
  <text start="482.79" dur="3.39">don&amp;#39;t really understand what facut is</text>
  <text start="484.38" dur="4.49">let me just explain what it is it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="486.18" dur="6.06">foreign account Tax Compliance Act and</text>
  <text start="488.87" dur="6.94">there was a it&amp;#39;s basically a law within</text>
  <text start="492.24" dur="6.21">a law FATCA effectively commanded every</text>
  <text start="495.81" dur="4.47">single bank on the planet to enter into</text>
  <text start="498.45" dur="3.27">an information sharing agreement with</text>
  <text start="500.28" dur="3.48">the IRS well actually it was one way</text>
  <text start="501.72" dur="4.14">they wanted the information from the</text>
  <text start="503.76" dur="3.9">banks to flow right to the IRS all</text>
  <text start="505.86" dur="4.49">across the world and nothing was going</text>
  <text start="507.66" dur="7.65">back so they&amp;#39;re really not sharing</text>
  <text start="510.35" dur="7.24">basically they&amp;#39;re giving it all started</text>
  <text start="515.31" dur="3.96">based on the phony assumption that</text>
  <text start="517.59" dur="4.44">millions of Americans were hiding</text>
  <text start="519.27" dur="7.26">trillions of dollars in secret offshore</text>
  <text start="522.03" dur="7.47">accounts and since the United States</text>
  <text start="526.53" dur="5.97">government was completely broke revenue</text>
  <text start="529.5" dur="5.1">was not coming in they figured they</text>
  <text start="532.5" dur="4.41">needed a way to bring revenue in to pay</text>
  <text start="534.6" dur="3.75">for all this debt and wow what we can do</text>
  <text start="536.91" dur="5.88">is we can go across the world and people</text>
  <text start="538.35" dur="6.99">must have money or currency in the banks</text>
  <text start="542.79" dur="7.41">and we&amp;#39;ll just take it from them and</text>
  <text start="545.34" dur="8.37">this will solve our problems well guess</text>
  <text start="550.2" dur="5.6">what happened all the countries had to</text>
  <text start="553.71" dur="5.28">come in line with this fact the law and</text>
  <text start="555.8" dur="5.02">if they didn&amp;#39;t they were threatened with</text>
  <text start="558.99" dur="3.96">a crippling thirty percent withholding</text>
  <text start="560.82" dur="5.27">tax on every dollar that went in and out</text>
  <text start="562.95" dur="7.92">through the land of the free</text>
  <text start="566.09" dur="10.75">banks complied and FATCA was rolled out</text>
  <text start="570.87" dur="7.38">across the world now the entire law was</text>
  <text start="576.84" dur="2.99">passed based on the premise that it</text>
  <text start="578.25" dur="4.59">would quickly fill in the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="579.83" dur="6.25">empty coffers with oodles of cash all</text>
  <text start="582.84" dur="8.66">around the world but guess what over the</text>
  <text start="586.08" dur="10.98">last five to six years it&amp;#39;s not working</text>
  <text start="591.5" dur="8.92">they can&amp;#39;t bring in enough guess what</text>
  <text start="597.06" dur="7.53">they&amp;#39;re finding people are not hiding</text>
  <text start="600.42" dur="8">money around the world people don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="604.59" dur="6.36">the funds they thought they had</text>
  <text start="608.42" dur="6.01">basically they brought in about 6.5</text>
  <text start="610.95" dur="8.37">billion roughly one dollar to 1.3</text>
  <text start="614.43" dur="6.57">billion per year and according to the</text>
  <text start="619.32" dur="3.99">association of certified financial crime</text>
  <text start="621" dur="5.04">specialists in organizations</text>
  <text start="623.31" dur="5.4">specializing in tax evasion faka will</text>
  <text start="626.04" dur="6.36">continue to generate roughly 800 million</text>
  <text start="628.71" dur="6.21">per year in tax revenue and I hate to</text>
  <text start="632.4" dur="5.04">say this but eight million doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="634.92" dur="5.88">constitute a drop in the bucket anymore</text>
  <text start="637.44" dur="5.82">it&amp;#39;s enough to pay about 17 hours worth</text>
  <text start="640.8" dur="9.2">of interest on the national debt that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="643.26" dur="9.93">it so what they tried to do did not work</text>
  <text start="650" dur="7.45">they pushed Obamacare out to bring in</text>
  <text start="653.19" dur="6.78">revenue it did not work we understand</text>
  <text start="657.45" dur="6.98">the IMF Christine Lagarde is proposing a</text>
  <text start="659.97" dur="6.69">carbon tax to help with the debt problem</text>
  <text start="664.43" dur="4.42">most of the countries are fighting</text>
  <text start="666.66" dur="5.43">against this most of the people are</text>
  <text start="668.85" dur="5.88">saying global warming is fake you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="672.09" dur="4.17">just doing this to tax the people to pay</text>
  <text start="674.73" dur="3.12">for this debt I mean Christine Lagarde</text>
  <text start="676.26" dur="7.02">was right out there saying yes this is</text>
  <text start="677.85" dur="12.8">what we&amp;#39;re doing and we heard that the</text>
  <text start="683.28" dur="11.25">IMF is proposing taxing everyone using</text>
  <text start="690.65" dur="6.78">taxes which equal ten percent of what</text>
  <text start="694.53" dur="5.33">you what your wealth is</text>
  <text start="697.43" dur="8.09">they are thinking of all different ways</text>
  <text start="699.86" dur="8.31">of bringing in revenue and guess what</text>
  <text start="705.52" dur="5.23">this is also going to be a problem so</text>
  <text start="708.17" dur="5.669">they wanted to take ten percent of your</text>
  <text start="710.75" dur="4.89">private savings in addition to the taxes</text>
  <text start="713.839" dur="6.091">that you&amp;#39;re already paying and if they</text>
  <text start="715.64" dur="6.96">can throw on top a carbon tax they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="719.93" dur="6.15">hoping that all of this will help bring</text>
  <text start="722.6" dur="5.91">down the debt of the world and where</text>
  <text start="726.08" dur="6.53">does this money flow to the central</text>
  <text start="728.51" dur="6.99">bankers because that&amp;#39;s who it&amp;#39;s owed to</text>
  <text start="732.61" dur="8.669">because they cannot keep this system</text>
  <text start="735.5" dur="9.66">afloat any longer and they know this and</text>
  <text start="741.279" dur="7.391">they have two options either the whole</text>
  <text start="745.16" dur="6.06">system crashes or they tax everyone</text>
  <text start="748.67" dur="4.32">around the world and it props up the</text>
  <text start="751.22" dur="4.05">system for a little bit longer but guess</text>
  <text start="752.99" dur="3.69">what the debts going to continue to rise</text>
  <text start="755.27" dur="2.939">they&amp;#39;re going to want twenty percent</text>
