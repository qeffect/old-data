  <text start="61.96" dur="5.82">May 2nd 2018 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="64.51" dur="5.94">episode is central banks make their move</text>
  <text start="67.78" dur="5.31">on cryptocurrency with Fed electronic</text>

  <text start="75.61" dur="4.92">central bank&amp;#39;s they have been pushing</text>
  <text start="78.25" dur="4.77">and demonizing gold and silver and</text>

  <text start="83.02" dur="4.14">of people out there don&amp;#39;t that do not</text>
  <text start="84.61" dur="5.52">like crypto currencies but the central</text>
  <text start="87.16" dur="6.66">bankers are completely nervous and</text>
  <text start="90.13" dur="5.52">afraid of gold and silver and crypto</text>
  <text start="93.82" dur="4.23">currencies because it&amp;#39;s another form of</text>
  <text start="95.65" dur="4.02">money even though people don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="98.05" dur="4.47">cryptocurrencies isn&amp;#39;t another form of</text>
  <text start="99.67" dur="3.99">money it is and they&amp;#39;re very nervous</text>
  <text start="102.52" dur="3.78">about this and this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="103.66" dur="6.54">talking about cryptocurrency being used</text>
  <text start="106.3" dur="7.62">for money laundering being used for</text>
  <text start="110.2" dur="6.21">criminality being used for everything</text>
  <text start="113.92" dur="5.49">else drugs and whatever else you want to</text>
  <text start="116.41" dur="5.25">come up with they continually harp on</text>
  <text start="119.41" dur="4.68">the same exact message over and over and</text>
  <text start="121.66" dur="5.52">over now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="124.09" dur="6.45">their entire story is about to fall</text>
  <text start="127.18" dur="6.059">apart and they are now pushing a</text>
  <text start="130.54" dur="4.29">different agenda where they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="133.239" dur="3.151">into the crypto market they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="134.83" dur="3.12">going into something completely</text>
  <text start="136.39" dur="3.3">different which is really not completely</text>
  <text start="137.95" dur="3.509">different it is pretty much the same</text>
  <text start="139.69" dur="3.66">that we already have today but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="141.459" dur="4.411">gonna discuss that in a minute let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.35" dur="5.07">talk about why their entire story is</text>
  <text start="145.87" dur="4.89">completely falling apart the Hong Kong</text>
  <text start="148.42" dur="5.099">financial services and Treasury the FST</text>
  <text start="150.76" dur="5.75">B they released a report on April 30th</text>
  <text start="153.519" dur="6.301">on the status of money laundering and</text>
  <text start="156.51" dur="5.35">terrorism financing now the report</text>
  <text start="159.82" dur="6">concluded that virtual currencies like</text>
  <text start="161.86" dur="8.37">Bitcoin are not particularly involved in</text>
  <text start="165.82" dur="7.44">either type of financial crime the FST</text>
  <text start="170.23" dur="7.49">be notes that although there is inherent</text>
  <text start="173.26" dur="6.449">money laundering and terrorism financing</text>
  <text start="177.72" dur="5.23">vulnerabilities related to virtual</text>
  <text start="179.709" dur="5.941">currencies they&amp;#39;re really not being used</text>
  <text start="182.95" dur="3.63">to push this what is being used to push</text>
  <text start="185.65" dur="3.93">us Oh</text>
  <text start="186.58" dur="6.6">that&amp;#39;s right cash that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="189.58" dur="7.53">used now the report did say that virtual</text>
  <text start="193.18" dur="6.6">currencies well they are used in crypto</text>
  <text start="197.11" dur="4.71">Ponzi schemes and cyber crimes now they</text>
  <text start="199.78" dur="3.99">mentioned wanna cry that wanna cry</text>
  <text start="201.82" dur="4.11">attack where basically it locked down</text>
  <text start="203.77" dur="6.81">your system held at hostage until you</text>
  <text start="205.93" dur="6.42">paid using Bitcoin now again once you do</text>
  <text start="210.58" dur="3.69">this it is on the ledger you can track</text>
  <text start="212.35" dur="3.93">down where this wallet is you can track</text>
  <text start="214.27" dur="3.39">down with the address where it is gone</text>
  <text start="216.28" dur="3.96">of course you don&amp;#39;t know the names and</text>
  <text start="217.66" dur="4.95">things like that so this type of crime</text>
  <text start="220.24" dur="4.89">most likely was being pushed out there</text>
  <text start="222.61" dur="4.53">by intelligent agencies and they</text>
  <text start="225.13" dur="3.84">probably took a wallet or something and</text>
  <text start="227.14" dur="3.72">and brought this out to everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="228.97" dur="4.05">attention to make it look like at the</text>
  <text start="230.86" dur="3.09">time it was North Korea because I think</text>
  <text start="233.02" dur="1.98">that&amp;#39;s where they were pointing their</text>
  <text start="233.95" dur="3.84">finger they were also pointing the</text>
  <text start="235" dur="5.73">finger at Russia now you need to</text>
  <text start="237.79" dur="4.98">understand that because of this report</text>
  <text start="240.73" dur="4.65">and because of what we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="242.77" dur="4.41">about we know that cryptocurrencies once</text>
  <text start="245.38" dur="4.59">again it&amp;#39;d be ridiculous</text>
  <text start="247.18" dur="5.339">to use them in money laundering or</text>
  <text start="249.97" dur="4.98">terrorism because you can trace</text>
  <text start="252.519" dur="4.291">everything cash on the other hand which</text>
  <text start="254.95" dur="3.99">is used in money laundering and</text>
  <text start="256.81" dur="5.22">terrorism and other financial crimes</text>
  <text start="258.94" dur="5.91">very difficult to trace so we can see</text>
  <text start="262.03" dur="5.4">right now that their entire story is</text>
  <text start="264.85" dur="4.5">completely falling apart and in a little</text>
  <text start="267.43" dur="4.53">bit we&amp;#39;re gonna discuss why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="269.35" dur="5.1">demonizing crypto currencies and what</text>
  <text start="271.96" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to make us do because</text>
  <text start="274.45" dur="4.95">we know they&amp;#39;ve been planning this for</text>
  <text start="277.24" dur="4.38">awhile and you don&amp;#39;t demonize something</text>
  <text start="279.4" dur="3.75">like this unless you have something that</text>
  <text start="281.62" dur="4.29">you want to push forward to make</text>
  <text start="283.15" dur="5.15">everyone look at this instead of that we</text>
  <text start="285.91" dur="5.13">see that ATP they came out and they</text>
  <text start="288.3" dur="7.119">printed their weakest job game since</text>
  <text start="291.04" dur="7.02">November and this is a very big miss</text>
  <text start="295.419" dur="5.341">it&amp;#39;s the biggest miss in seven years and</text>
  <text start="298.06" dur="5.04">once again the job situation is not</text>
  <text start="300.76" dur="3.9">doing well yes these numbers are</text>
  <text start="303.1" dur="4.41">manipulated they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating</text>
  <text start="304.66" dur="6.259">them since Obama actually before Obama</text>
  <text start="307.51" dur="5.61">but when we hit the 2008 crisis they</text>
  <text start="310.919" dur="4.361">pushed this manipulation</text>
  <text start="313.12" dur="4.41">really really hard to make everyone</text>
  <text start="315.28" dur="4.83">believe that the economy has been</text>
  <text start="317.53" dur="4.86">recovering that we&amp;#39;re doing well</text>
  <text start="320.11" dur="4.47">nothing has changed the manipulation is</text>
  <text start="322.39" dur="4.74">exactly the same as it was before</text>
  <text start="324.58" dur="4.74">nothing has changed whatsoever what has</text>
  <text start="327.13" dur="4.83">changed is what the real economy is</text>
  <text start="329.32" dur="4.65">doing with the indicators that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="331.96" dur="4.02">been presenting showing that we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="333.97" dur="3.93">recession or some of them saying that</text>
  <text start="335.98" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;re headed towards a recession</text>
  <text start="337.9" dur="4.8">actually some saying even a depression</text>
  <text start="340.24" dur="4.94">and we can see from the real economy of</text>
  <text start="342.7" dur="4.8">retail GDP and everything like that</text>
  <text start="345.18" dur="3.4">everything is starting to completely</text>
  <text start="347.5" dur="2.94">fall apart we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="348.58" dur="3.96">companies where they&amp;#39;re saying their</text>
  <text start="350.44" dur="4.35">earnings are not there we&amp;#39;re seeing food</text>
  <text start="352.54" dur="4.41">establishments shut their doors and</text>
  <text start="354.79" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re also seeing automotive dealers</text>
  <text start="356.95" dur="4.68">saying that or automotive manufacturers</text>
  <text start="359.77" dur="3.63">saying that listen we need to</text>
  <text start="361.63" dur="3.66">restructure we need to change what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="363.4" dur="3.99">been doing because what we&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="365.29" dur="3.78">is not going to work moving forward</text>
  <text start="367.39" dur="2.64">because because again what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="369.07" dur="6.09">doing is they&amp;#39;ve been selling</text>
  <text start="370.03" dur="8.37">automobiles by using the subprime people</text>
  <text start="375.16" dur="5.31">and those people have been delinquent on</text>
  <text start="378.4" dur="4.32">their payments a lot of them in</text>
  <text start="380.47" dur="4.32">defaulting and it doesn&amp;#39;t look good</text>
  <text start="382.72" dur="3.84">actually Ford announced that is going to</text>
  <text start="384.79" dur="3.81">hack off a large portion of its business</text>
  <text start="386.56" dur="5.97">a move that will make the company ninety</text>
  <text start="388.6" dur="6.66">percent reliant on its pickups trucks</text>
  <text start="392.53" dur="5.61">SUVs and commercial vehicles by the year</text>
  <text start="395.26" dur="5.52">2020 the company is targeting twenty</text>
  <text start="398.14" dur="5.58">five point five billion in cost cuts by</text>
  <text start="400.78" dur="6.42">the year 2022 now they&amp;#39;re saying this is</text>
  <text start="403.72" dur="6.3">a restructure a lot of jobs are gonna</text>
  <text start="407.2" dur="5.91">disappear and things are not going well</text>
  <text start="410.02" dur="5.43">remember the smaller subprime auto</text>
  <text start="413.11" dur="5.61">lenders are starting to implode right</text>
  <text start="415.45" dur="5.25">now and the larger companies they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="418.72" dur="4.89">gonna be next and the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="420.7" dur="5.16">going to crash and I believe the auto</text>
  <text start="423.61" dur="4.29">manufacturers those that are looking at</text>
  <text start="425.86" dur="3.9">these signs are seeing the writing on</text>
  <text start="427.9" dur="3.33">the wall and a lot of them are going to</text>
  <text start="429.76" dur="5.43">cut their costs because they realize</text>
  <text start="431.23" dur="6.63">what is coming just like in 2008 many of</text>
  <text start="435.19" dur="3.96">the manufacturers especially GM didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="437.86" dur="3.06">realize what was happening and they just</text>
  <text start="439.15" dur="3.57">kept on spending taking out more credit</text>
  <text start="440.92" dur="2.31">and before you know what Pontiac was</text>
  <text start="442.72" dur="3.72">gone</text>
  <text start="443.23" dur="5.13">Saturn was gone and basically they shut</text>
  <text start="446.44" dur="3.78">all of the doors shut the plan shut</text>
  <text start="448.36" dur="3.75">everything now in the housing market we</text>
  <text start="450.22" dur="3.78">can see that everything is completely</text>
  <text start="452.11" dur="6.45">falling apart and we see mortgage</text>
  <text start="454" dur="7.02">well they have jumped to 2011 levels now</text>
  <text start="458.56" dur="4.2">this is pretty darn fast</text>
  <text start="461.02" dur="3.99">the average interest rate for</text>
  <text start="462.76" dur="4.29">thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages with</text>
  <text start="465.01" dur="3.57">conforming loan balances of about four</text>
  <text start="467.05" dur="6.12">hundred fifty three thousand or less</text>
  <text start="468.58" dur="7.32">with 20% down jumped to 4.8% for the</text>
  <text start="473.17" dur="4.29">week ending April 27th from four point</text>
  <text start="475.9" dur="3.93">seven three percent in the prior week</text>
  <text start="477.46" dur="4.65">and from four four point six six percent</text>
  <text start="479.83" dur="5.16">two weeks ago this is coming from the</text>
  <text start="482.11" dur="5.49">Mortgage Bankers Association at four</text>
  <text start="484.99" dur="5.28">point eight percent the average 30-year</text>
  <text start="487.6" dur="6.12">fixed-rate is now equal to the highest</text>
  <text start="490.27" dur="5.22">rate since September of 2013 and the</text>
  <text start="493.72" dur="5.58">last time the rate was higher than four</text>
  <text start="495.49" dur="6.929">point eight percent was in 2011 at five</text>
  <text start="499.3" dur="4.65">point two percent the average the</text>
  <text start="502.419" dur="5.671">average mortgage rate will hit the</text>
  <text start="503.95" dur="5.49">highest level since 2010 five point five</text>
  <text start="508.09" dur="4.949">percent would take it to the highest</text>
  <text start="509.44" dur="7.68">level since 2008 now think about this</text>
  <text start="513.039" dur="6.87">for a second prior to 2008 the interest</text>
  <text start="517.12" dur="5.28">rates were moving up when we hit 2008</text>
  <text start="519.909" dur="5.461">they were on their way down already</text>
  <text start="522.4" dur="4.53">because the Fed already started the</text>
  <text start="525.37" dur="3.86">domino effect and everything started to</text>
  <text start="526.93" dur="6.84">fall apart here we are we&amp;#39;re approaching</text>
  <text start="529.23" dur="6.39">the 2008 rate and believe me in a couple</text>
  <text start="533.77" dur="4.38">of weeks we&amp;#39;re probably going to hit it</text>
  <text start="535.62" dur="4.48">which means it&amp;#39;s going to push a lot of</text>
  <text start="538.15" dur="3.72">people out of the housing market so if</text>
  <text start="540.1" dur="4.47">we look at this the big difference</text>
  <text start="541.87" dur="5.34">between 2010 and now and between 2008</text>
  <text start="544.57" dur="4.92">and now is that home prices have</text>
  <text start="547.21" dur="4.95">skyrocketed since then in many markets</text>
  <text start="549.49" dur="6.18">by over 50% in some markets such as</text>
  <text start="552.16" dur="6.15">Denver Dallas or the five County San</text>
  <text start="555.67" dur="6.09">Francisco Bay Area for example according</text>
  <text start="558.31" dur="6.09">to case-shiller home price index has</text>
  <text start="561.76" dur="6.11">increased by twenty five to forty</text>
  <text start="564.4" dur="6.48">percent which means these homes are</text>
  <text start="567.87" dur="5.05">completely unaffordable now put on top</text>
  <text start="570.88" dur="4.44">of this those people had been losing</text>
  <text start="572.92" dur="3.9">their job who&amp;#39;ve gotten other jobs but</text>
  <text start="575.32" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re not high paying jobs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="576.82" dur="4.86">part-time jobs many people have one two</text>
  <text start="579.04" dur="3.81">three part-time jobs or they found</text>
  <text start="581.68" dur="3.69">another job but they&amp;#39;re making less</text>
  <text start="582.85" dur="4.76">money other people they&amp;#39;re not getting</text>
  <text start="585.37" dur="3.65">wage increases like they used to or</text>
  <text start="587.61" dur="3.9">basically the company said we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="589.02" dur="5.34">going to give any wage increases they</text>
  <text start="591.51" dur="6.42">can&amp;#39;t afford these homes and again this</text>
  <text start="594.36" dur="6.69">is why Fannie Mae is out there and they</text>
  <text start="597.93" dur="5.16">have allowed 3% down on a home with no</text>
  <text start="601.05" dur="4.68">income check pretty soon you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="603.09" dur="4.98">see 0% down because again this is the</text>
  <text start="605.73" dur="4.8">endgame if we look at the mortgage</text>
  <text start="608.07" dur="7.08">applications for the week of April 27th</text>
  <text start="610.53" dur="6.48">we see they&amp;#39;re down by 2.5% and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="615.15" dur="4.2">gonna continually decline as time goes</text>
  <text start="617.01" dur="4.23">on because people are being thrown out</text>
  <text start="619.35" dur="3.99">of the market which means the housing</text>
  <text start="621.24" dur="5.63">market is going to fall apart which it</text>
  <text start="623.34" dur="5.88">is already now the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="626.87" dur="4.06">they&amp;#39;ve been looking at cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="629.22" dur="3.27">and we talked about the report where</text>
  <text start="630.93" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re saying that Bitcoin and other</text>
  <text start="632.49" dur="5.16">cryptocurrencies they&amp;#39;re really not</text>
  <text start="634.41" dur="6.3">being used in money laundering terrorism</text>
  <text start="637.65" dur="4.59">financing even though the central banks</text>
  <text start="640.71" dur="3.96">are out there and the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="642.24" dur="4.44">out there telling us yes they are which</text>
  <text start="644.67" dur="3.99">means that&amp;#39;s the place you probably</text>
  <text start="646.68" dur="4.2">should be just like gold and silver it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="648.66" dur="3.66">a barbarous relic that&amp;#39;s where you need</text>
  <text start="650.88" dur="4.47">to be because when the system comes down</text>
  <text start="652.32" dur="4.71">wherever they tell you not to be is</text>
  <text start="655.35" dur="3.45">where you need to be and every place</text>
  <text start="657.03" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re telling you you should be is a</text>
  <text start="658.8" dur="3.48">place where you shouldn&amp;#39;t be just like</text>
  <text start="661.05" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re telling you the stock market is</text>
  <text start="662.28" dur="4.53">doing great housings fine you should all</text>
  <text start="664.56" dur="5.52">be in that and what happened think back</text>
  <text start="666.81" dur="4.98">to 2008 everything fell apart back then</text>
  <text start="670.08" dur="3.36">they told you don&amp;#39;t even touch gold and</text>
  <text start="671.79" dur="3.72">then all of a sudden gold started to</text>
  <text start="673.44" dur="5.04">skyrocket yes they had the ability to</text>
  <text start="675.51" dur="6.18">manipulate it but again this is a</text>
  <text start="678.48" dur="5.21">central bank system but again if you</text>
  <text start="681.69" dur="4.29">came in earlier than that point of time</text>
  <text start="683.69" dur="4.51">even though they had manipulation you</text>
  <text start="685.98" dur="4.56">would purchase the gold at five hundred</text>
  <text start="688.2" dur="5.37">eight hundred and you still would have</text>
  <text start="690.54" dur="5.07">made out what happened was people waited</text>
  <text start="693.57" dur="4.5">until gold and silver and everything</text>
  <text start="695.61" dur="4.17">else hit its highs and in the Central</text>
  <text start="698.07" dur="4.05">Bank realized whoa whoa whoa we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="699.78" dur="3.93">let this go up any further we need some</text>
  <text start="702.12" dur="3.18">manipulation here we need to bring this</text>
  <text start="703.71" dur="3.06">down and that&amp;#39;s what they started to do</text>
  <text start="705.3" dur="3.36">and a lot of people bought at the height</text>
  <text start="706.77" dur="3.51">those people that bought at five hundred</text>
  <text start="708.66" dur="5.25">eight hundred nine hundred they were</text>
  <text start="710.28" dur="6.27">like hey everything&amp;#39;s good so we can see</text>
  <text start="713.91" dur="5.31">right now the Fed they have been</text>
  <text start="716.55" dur="4.47">demonizing cryptocurrency and gold for a</text>
  <text start="719.22" dur="5.429">specific reason now</text>
  <text start="721.02" dur="6.21">the Fed and we know from last year they</text>
  <text start="724.649" dur="4.851">made some headlines saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="727.23" dur="5.76">gonna be looking at a cryptocurrency and</text>
  <text start="729.5" dur="4.6">they decided well maybe we don&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="732.99" dur="3.45">look at a cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="734.1" dur="4.26">maybe we should be looking at something</text>
  <text start="736.44" dur="3.66">completely different which is actually</text>
  <text start="738.36" dur="3.47">the same that we have today but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="740.1" dur="4.739">making it seem like it is different</text>
  <text start="741.83" dur="4.96">maybe we will create something called</text>
  <text start="744.839" dur="4.291">the central bank electronic money for</text>
  <text start="746.79" dur="5.76">all and this is coming from the st.</text>
  <text start="749.13" dur="4.769">Louis Fed they&amp;#39;re saying that this is</text>
  <text start="752.55" dur="3.99">something that would be easily</text>
  <text start="753.899" dur="4.141">implemented the Fed would only need to</text>
  <text start="756.54" dur="3.57">allow households and firms to open</text>
  <text start="758.04" dur="4.08">accounts with it which would allow the</text>
  <text start="760.11" dur="4.169">central banks to make payments with the</text>
  <text start="762.12" dur="5.48">Fed issued Electric electronic money</text>
  <text start="764.279" dur="6.06">instead of commercial bank deposits a</text>
  <text start="767.6" dur="4.87">large part of the population will</text>
  <text start="770.339" dur="4.981">consider Fed elec electronic money a</text>
  <text start="772.47" dur="5.63">closed substitute for cash and this will</text>
  <text start="775.32" dur="5.61">make it easier to say goodbye to cash</text>
  <text start="778.1" dur="5.049">for instance lunch legislation</text>
  <text start="780.93" dur="5.01">introduced last week by Senator Kristin</text>
  <text start="783.149" dur="4.761">Gillibrand calls for thirty six thousand</text>
  <text start="785.94" dur="5.37">post offices around the u.s. to add</text>
  <text start="787.91" dur="5.5">basic banking services such as savings</text>
  <text start="791.31" dur="4.38">and checking accounts and short-term</text>
  <text start="793.41" dur="4.11">loans it aims to reach a still</text>
  <text start="795.69" dur="4.62">significant number of unbanked and</text>
  <text start="797.52" dur="4.95">underbanked Americans with an offering</text>
  <text start="800.31" dur="4.83">similar to that of postal systems</text>
  <text start="802.47" dur="4.83">overseas with the bill the New York</text>
  <text start="805.14" dur="4.949">Democrat said she hopes to wipe out the</text>
  <text start="807.3" dur="5.279">so-called payday lenders is this really</text>
  <text start="810.089" dur="5.131">why they&amp;#39;re doing it most likely not it</text>
  <text start="812.579" dur="7.141">looks like they&amp;#39;re building this up to</text>
  <text start="815.22" dur="6.809">usher in the Fed electronic money now</text>
  <text start="819.72" dur="5.609">this new alternative form of electronic</text>
  <text start="822.029" dur="5.941">money would have a disciplinary effect</text>
  <text start="825.329" dur="4.32">on commercial banks they&amp;#39;d be forced to</text>
  <text start="827.97" dur="3.78">alter their business models to attract</text>
  <text start="829.649" dur="4.651">depositors for example taking fewer</text>
  <text start="831.75" dur="5.16">risks or holding more capital offering</text>
  <text start="834.3" dur="4.409">higher interest rates because again</text>
  <text start="836.91" dur="4.04">everything would be flowing through the</text>
  <text start="838.709" dur="5.82">central bank system and this would be a</text>
  <text start="840.95" dur="5.5">Fed electronic money has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="844.529" dur="3.841">with the United States it&amp;#39;s like the</text>
  <text start="846.45" dur="4.829">Federal Reserve Note but now it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="848.37" dur="4.17">Fed electronic money the Fed would be</text>
  <text start="851.279" dur="3.271">able to set the interest rates on</text>
  <text start="852.54" dur="4.35">household accounts</text>
  <text start="854.55" dur="4.7">as its main policy tool basically Fed</text>
  <text start="856.89" dur="5.31">would have more control over everything</text>
  <text start="859.25" dur="5.68">so this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="862.2" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince you that gold</text>
  <text start="864.93" dur="6.36">and silver cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="866.19" dur="7.68">they are no good for you and what we do</text>
  <text start="871.29" dur="3.51">need is we need something that the Fed</text>
  <text start="873.87" dur="3.51">can control</text>
  <text start="874.8" dur="4.229">remember the central banking system they</text>
  <text start="877.38" dur="2.67">want everything centralized they want</text>
  <text start="879.029" dur="3.18">full control they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="880.05" dur="3.75">decentralization they don&amp;#39;t like it</text>
  <text start="882.209" dur="3.031">where you can hold the physical gold or</text>
  <text start="883.8" dur="2.34">physical silver because they have no</text>
  <text start="885.24" dur="3.18">control over that</text>
  <text start="886.14" dur="4.949">so the st. Louis Fed went on to say that</text>
  <text start="888.42" dur="3.93">listen central bank&amp;#39;s just don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="891.089" dur="3.601">get into the business of issuing</text>
  <text start="892.35" dur="5.19">anonymous virtual currency that could be</text>
  <text start="894.69" dur="4.47">used by drug cartel to launder money we</text>
  <text start="897.54" dur="4.71">would rather have a centralized system</text>
  <text start="899.16" dur="5.46">where we don&amp;#39;t have that and the Fed</text>
  <text start="902.25" dur="6.899">electronic money would allow people to</text>
  <text start="904.62" dur="7.589">go to the electronic system which is</text>
  <text start="909.149" dur="6.031">just like virtual currency and virtual</text>
  <text start="912.209" dur="4.831">cryptocurrency and you won&amp;#39;t have to use</text>
  <text start="915.18" dur="3">cash so you can use your phones you can</text>
  <text start="917.04" dur="3.33">use everything else that you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="918.18" dur="5.82">using but there&amp;#39;d be no more cash and</text>
  <text start="920.37" dur="4.98">this would be electronic money well</text>
  <text start="924" dur="2.91">isn&amp;#39;t this really the same thing that we</text>
  <text start="925.35" dur="4.08">have today and all they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="926.91" dur="4.47">getting rid of cash yes that&amp;#39;s what it</text>
  <text start="929.43" dur="4.529">is and the Fed will take more control</text>
  <text start="931.38" dur="4.23">over everything because they will</text>
  <text start="933.959" dur="3.931">control the interest rates on the</text>
  <text start="935.61" dur="4.38">accounts you would directly get the Fed</text>
  <text start="937.89" dur="3.6">money from them I mean think about what</text>
  <text start="939.99" dur="5.159">they&amp;#39;re trying to do here they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="941.49" dur="6.24">tricking everybody making them think</text>
  <text start="945.149" dur="4.351">that this is just like cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="947.73" dur="4.229">and that&amp;#39;s how they&amp;#39;re gonna promote it</text>
  <text start="949.5" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t go a cryptocurrency because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="951.959" dur="3.541">used by terrorists and money launderers</text>
  <text start="953.82" dur="4.17">and everything else go with the Fed</text>
  <text start="955.5" dur="5.22">money it&amp;#39;s safe it&amp;#39;s good for you you</text>
  <text start="957.99" dur="4.74">don&amp;#39;t need cash anymore and this is what</text>
  <text start="960.72" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re trying to push right now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="962.73" dur="5.04">always a reason why they come out and</text>
  <text start="965.49" dur="5.07">they demonize something because that</text>
  <text start="967.77" dur="4.499">means their plan is to promote something</text>
  <text start="970.56" dur="4.38">they have and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="972.269" dur="4.741">to do now we talked about how the</text>
  <text start="974.94" dur="5.07">corporate media they were going to start</text>
  <text start="977.01" dur="6.3">to basically put up articles to show</text>
  <text start="980.01" dur="5.069">that the economy is not doing well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="983.31" dur="3.719">not as strong as Trump has said and</text>
  <text start="985.079" dur="3.911">we&amp;#39;re already starting to see this</text>
  <text start="987.029" dur="5.321">coming out of the Washington Post</text>
  <text start="988.99" dur="7.77">the headline reads Trump has not made</text>
  <text start="992.35" dur="8.25">the economy great again and they went</text>
  <text start="996.76" dur="5.91">into the GDP numbers how everything is</text>
  <text start="1000.6" dur="4.95">manipulated you can&amp;#39;t really follow them</text>
  <text start="1002.67" dur="5.79">and it&amp;#39;s just hilarious because we know</text>
  <text start="1005.55" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re manipulated nothing has changed</text>
  <text start="1008.46" dur="3.99">since Obama so if they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1010.2" dur="5.61">manipulated now then it was manipulated</text>
  <text start="1012.45" dur="4.71">during Obama&amp;#39;s time but again what</text>
  <text start="1015.81" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re setting</text>
  <text start="1017.16" dur="5.04">it up because they know eventually they</text>
  <text start="1019.62" dur="4.2">want to point the finger so already</text>
  <text start="1022.2" dur="3.11">we&amp;#39;re seeing the article coming out of</text>
  <text start="1023.82" dur="4.23">the Washington Post and many other</text>
  <text start="1025.31" dur="6.91">publications saying that the economy is</text>
  <text start="1028.05" dur="7.95">not doing as well and Jason Furman</text>
  <text start="1032.22" dur="6.78">who was the adviser to Obama well he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1036" dur="6.45">giving some pointers to basically tell</text>
  <text start="1039" dur="7.05">you what the final GDP numbers will be</text>
  <text start="1042.45" dur="6.21">and he&amp;#39;s talking about revisions how 2.9</text>
  <text start="1046.05" dur="5.13">percent isn&amp;#39;t real and this is why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1048.66" dur="5.97">much lower than that and he goes back to</text>
  <text start="1051.18" dur="5.88">the same 2 to 2.5 percent where the</text>
  <text start="1054.63" dur="4.74">economy came in during Obama&amp;#39;s reign now</text>
  <text start="1057.06" dur="3.84">basically those numbers and these</text>
  <text start="1059.37" dur="3.15">numbers but all of it it&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="1060.9" dur="3.96">manipulation there is no difference</text>
  <text start="1062.52" dur="4.74">whatsoever what Trump is doing and the</text>
  <text start="1064.86" dur="4.53">Patriots they are pushing what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1067.26" dur="4.05">set up and they&amp;#39;re keeping what they set</text>
  <text start="1069.39" dur="3.99">up to push it to the red line</text>
  <text start="1071.31" dur="3.39">to say this is the system you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1073.38" dur="3.78">using we haven&amp;#39;t touched it</text>
  <text start="1074.7" dur="4.56">nothing&amp;#39;s changed and this is the</text>
  <text start="1077.16" dur="3.93">calculations you&amp;#39;ve been using and now</text>
  <text start="1079.26" dur="3.96">you&amp;#39;re calling us out on the things that</text>
  <text start="1081.09" dur="3.78">you&amp;#39;ve been doing think about what</text>
  <text start="1083.22" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re doing here and the reason why</text>
  <text start="1084.87" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re becoming so desperate to blame</text>
  <text start="1086.43" dur="3.99">this on Trump because it is time to</text>
  <text start="1088.59" dur="3.54">bring the system down and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1090.42" dur="2.88">see a lot more of these articles we&amp;#39;re</text>
