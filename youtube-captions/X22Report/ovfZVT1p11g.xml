  <text start="53.41" dur="5.579">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="57.37" dur="5.22">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.989" dur="6.39">episode 1356 b and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="62.59" dur="5.19">august 15 2017 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="65.379" dur="4.35">episode is the elite push their latest</text>
  <text start="67.78" dur="5.52">agenda divide and conquer</text>
  <text start="69.729" dur="5.311">but it&amp;#39;s failing let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="73.3" dur="4.47">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="75.04" dur="5.219">geopolitical news now as we can see the</text>
  <text start="77.77" dur="5.91">corporate media they are just pushing</text>
  <text start="80.259" dur="9.181">the entire charlottesville agenda for</text>
  <text start="83.68" dur="7.71">the elite the deep state and what they</text>
  <text start="89.44" dur="4.679">are doing right now which they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="91.39" dur="6.05">in the past and they&amp;#39;ll continue to do</text>
  <text start="94.119" dur="8.271">because they like when they&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="97.44" dur="8.44">divide two sets of people or divide</text>
  <text start="102.39" dur="5.22">countries and have them fight against</text>
  <text start="105.88" dur="5.099">each other I&amp;#39;ll give you an example</text>
  <text start="107.61" dur="5.41">North Korea South Korea you have two</text>
  <text start="110.979" dur="3.931">different countries they don&amp;#39;t want them</text>
  <text start="113.02" dur="4.29">working together because if they start</text>
  <text start="114.91" dur="4.86">to work together and they start to work</text>
  <text start="117.31" dur="6.3">together economically guess what happens</text>
  <text start="119.77" dur="5.43">you lose the boogieman North Korea is no</text>
  <text start="123.61" dur="3.69">longer the boogeyman they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="125.2" dur="4.559">with South Korea and there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="127.3" dur="4.44">there and if you look at all the</text>
  <text start="129.759" dur="5.881">different places around the world what</text>
  <text start="131.74" dur="6.65">the elite like to do they like to pit</text>
  <text start="135.64" dur="5.4">different nations against each other and</text>
  <text start="138.39" dur="5.319">this is why one of the reasons they have</text>
  <text start="141.04" dur="5.85">regime change in certain areas just like</text>
  <text start="143.709" dur="5.881">with Ukraine they wanted that area and</text>
  <text start="146.89" dur="5.4">now they can take Ukraine and they can</text>
  <text start="149.59" dur="4.68">put it against Russia and they do this</text>
  <text start="152.29" dur="4.62">very very well this has been their</text>
  <text start="154.27" dur="5.34">tactic for a very long time they also</text>
  <text start="156.91" dur="5.06">use this within countries like the</text>
  <text start="159.61" dur="4.95">United States for example where they</text>
  <text start="161.97" dur="4.69">divide people well you have a Republican</text>
  <text start="164.56" dur="3.929">you have Democrat you have the left you</text>
  <text start="166.66" dur="4.26">have the right you have black you have</text>
  <text start="168.489" dur="5.761">white and what they like to do is they</text>
  <text start="170.92" dur="4.92">like to divide the people and they like</text>
  <text start="174.25" dur="4.5">to have the people fight amongst</text>
  <text start="175.84" dur="3.81">themselves this way you can&amp;#39;t see what</text>
  <text start="178.75" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="179.65" dur="4.32">the focus is off of them and this is</text>
  <text start="182.8" dur="3.51">what they&amp;#39;ve been doing here in the</text>
  <text start="183.97" dur="3.27">United States and we&amp;#39;ve seen it in many</text>
  <text start="186.31" dur="3.81">different areas</text>
  <text start="187.24" dur="8.01">where they try to gin up something to</text>
  <text start="190.12" dur="8.61">try to get these type of wars within the</text>
  <text start="195.25" dur="5.55">country and they try to expand them to</text>
  <text start="198.73" dur="5.37">different cities and most of the time it</text>
  <text start="200.8" dur="5.04">completely fails it dies down people</text>
  <text start="204.1" dur="3.51">look at the situation and say you know</text>
  <text start="205.84" dur="3.78">something why are we doing this this</text>
  <text start="207.61" dur="4.65">makes no sense but they still have those</text>
  <text start="209.62" dur="4.59">agent provocateurs that go out there and</text>
  <text start="212.26" dur="4.98">do this and Charlottesville is one of</text>
  <text start="214.21" dur="6.12">them this basically is the same divide</text>
  <text start="217.24" dur="6.27">and conquer technique now they want this</text>
  <text start="220.33" dur="6.36">to spread across the country now</text>
  <text start="223.51" dur="3.84">remember they&amp;#39;re losing out in the</text>
  <text start="226.69" dur="3.21">Middle East</text>
  <text start="227.35" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;ve lost Syria I mean that&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="229.9" dur="4.77">known fact right now North Korea they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="232.93" dur="2.97">trying to push their agenda there</text>
  <text start="234.67" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re also trying to push it in</text>
  <text start="235.9" dur="5.04">Venezuela but we can see that their</text>
  <text start="238.45" dur="5.82">plans they&amp;#39;re going down the tubes it is</text>
  <text start="240.94" dur="5.94">not going to work and what is happening</text>
  <text start="244.27" dur="5.6">right now is they&amp;#39;re going to create as</text>
  <text start="246.88" dur="6.06">much chaos within the United States</text>
  <text start="249.87" dur="5.59">throughout Europe throughout the Middle</text>
  <text start="252.94" dur="6.87">East in North Korea Venezuela wherever</text>
  <text start="255.46" dur="6.63">they possibly can to divide everyone and</text>
  <text start="259.81" dur="5.49">have people fight against each other</text>
  <text start="262.09" dur="6.63">this has been their plan from the</text>
  <text start="265.3" dur="6.21">beginning and this is still their agenda</text>
  <text start="268.72" dur="6.15">this is their last attempt now remember</text>
  <text start="271.51" dur="5.34">they really don&amp;#39;t give up all they do is</text>
  <text start="274.87" dur="4.05">regroup and come up with a new plan but</text>
  <text start="276.85" dur="4.68">their goal is always the same and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="278.92" dur="4.2">been tracking this for a very long time</text>
  <text start="281.53" dur="4.5">and this is exactly what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="283.12" dur="7.23">doing now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="286.03" dur="7.35">that there&amp;#39;s a group called disrupt j-20</text>
  <text start="290.35" dur="5.85">and the Department of Justice is</text>
  <text start="293.38" dur="5.67">demanding 1.3 million IP addresses of</text>
  <text start="296.2" dur="5.79">visitors to an Tifa web sites used to</text>
  <text start="299.05" dur="6.09">coordinate riots now the warrant is very</text>
  <text start="301.99" dur="6.42">broad and it looks like they want the</text>
  <text start="305.14" dur="5.28">hosting company DreamHost to hand over</text>
  <text start="308.41" dur="4.08">all this data names dresses and stuff</text>
  <text start="310.42" dur="4.29">like that and it&amp;#39;s almost like going out</text>
  <text start="312.49" dur="4.92">there saying listen we have this warrant</text>
  <text start="314.71" dur="5.19">we need half of America to hand over</text>
  <text start="317.41" dur="3.659">their information the warrant needs to</text>
  <text start="319.9" dur="4.799">be a little bit more</text>
  <text start="321.069" dur="5.731">and a little bit more direct and what</text>
  <text start="324.699" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re trying to do here but what</text>
  <text start="326.8" dur="5.099">they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="329.469" dur="5.211">to root out all these type of groups</text>
  <text start="331.899" dur="6.57">that have been involved in creating</text>
  <text start="334.68" dur="5.979">these type of riots within these</text>
  <text start="338.469" dur="4.35">protests now remember when we look at</text>
  <text start="340.659" dur="4.38">all these different protests they start</text>
  <text start="342.819" dur="3.63">out peacefully they go through all the</text>
  <text start="345.039" dur="3.421">procedures getting the permits and</text>
  <text start="346.449" dur="5.67">things like that and then they bring in</text>
  <text start="348.46" dur="5.669">the agent provocateurs to disrupt to</text>
  <text start="352.119" dur="2.491">make it look like oh it&amp;#39;s a black and</text>
  <text start="354.129" dur="3.87">white thing</text>
  <text start="354.61" dur="6.389">oh it&amp;#39;s a left and right thing oh it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="357.999" dur="5.25">you know white supremacists or Nazi type</text>
  <text start="360.999" dur="4.47">of thing and they push this as hard as</text>
  <text start="363.249" dur="4.98">they possibly can and this is what</text>
  <text start="365.469" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;ve done in Charlottesville where</text>
  <text start="368.229" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to push this agenda</text>
  <text start="370.029" dur="4.62">as hard as they possibly can but it</text>
  <text start="372.819" dur="4.201">looks like it&amp;#39;s really not going</text>
  <text start="374.649" dur="3.99">anywhere yes it looks fantastic on the</text>
  <text start="377.02" dur="4.019">corporate media they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="378.639" dur="4.471">involve Trump in this actually Paul</text>
  <text start="381.039" dur="3.27">Craig Roberts was out there saying it</text>
  <text start="383.11" dur="3.599">looks like they&amp;#39;re trying to do whatever</text>
  <text start="384.309" dur="4.29">they possibly can to link Trump into</text>
  <text start="386.709" dur="4.08">this where Trump was out there saying</text>
  <text start="388.599" dur="3.96">you know America first and then of</text>
  <text start="390.789" dur="3.03">course they&amp;#39;re taking America first and</text>
  <text start="392.559" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re trying to switch it around</text>
  <text start="393.819" dur="4.47">saying that white America comes first so</text>
  <text start="396.399" dur="3.3">that has to do with Trump but if you</text>
  <text start="398.289" dur="5.91">really look at this and you look at the</text>
  <text start="399.699" dur="7.53">past where we had Bush Cheney Obama the</text>
  <text start="404.199" dur="5.4">neoconservatives and the rest remember</text>
  <text start="407.229" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re the ones who said that Americans</text>
  <text start="409.599" dur="7.41">are exceptional people whose country is</text>
  <text start="413.139" dur="6.15">the indispensable country how does this</text>
  <text start="417.009" dur="5.37">differ from Trump&amp;#39;s proclamation of</text>
  <text start="419.289" dur="5.55">America first no one among the liberal</text>
  <text start="422.379" dur="4.171">progressive left was disturbed when</text>
  <text start="424.839" dur="7.08">Obama proclaimed to the world that</text>
  <text start="426.55" dur="8.429">Americans are exceptional indispensable</text>
  <text start="431.919" dur="5.81">people doesn&amp;#39;t Obama use much clearer</text>
  <text start="434.979" dur="5.22">language that puts America first if</text>
  <text start="437.729" dur="4.3">Americans are exceptional everyone else</text>
  <text start="440.199" dur="3.921">is unexceptional if Americans are</text>
  <text start="442.029" dur="4.86">indispensable everyone else is</text>
  <text start="444.12" dur="5.709">dispensable what&amp;#39;s the difference Paul</text>
  <text start="446.889" dur="5.34">Craig Roberts says one difference is</text>
  <text start="449.829" dur="4.741">that Obama was elected by the good</text>
  <text start="452.229" dur="5.571">people the non racist</text>
  <text start="454.57" dur="6.12">non misogynist non white supremacy and</text>
  <text start="457.8" dur="7.39">Trump was elected by the deplorable z--</text>
  <text start="460.69" dur="6.15">according to Hillary&amp;#39;s team Trump was</text>
  <text start="465.19" dur="7.05">elected by all those individuals that</text>
  <text start="466.84" dur="8.16">were not for the elite not for these</text>
  <text start="472.24" dur="6.29">individuals that want to go out and</text>
  <text start="475" dur="9.56">Empire build and destroy other nations</text>
  <text start="478.53" dur="6.03">to control the populations of the world</text>
  <text start="484.8" dur="6">basically both I should say all these</text>
  <text start="488.62" dur="5.16">presidents said the same exact thing but</text>
  <text start="490.8" dur="6.73">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re attacking</text>
  <text start="493.78" dur="6.93">Trump because he&amp;#39;s not part of their</text>
  <text start="497.53" dur="5.49">system and they don&amp;#39;t like it and what</text>
  <text start="500.71" dur="5.16">he&amp;#39;s doing is that he&amp;#39;s undoing</text>
  <text start="503.02" dur="4.56">everything that they tried to do over</text>
  <text start="505.87" dur="4.47">the many many years where they tried to</text>
  <text start="507.58" dur="4.23">have this one-world government have all</text>
  <text start="510.34" dur="4.139">the nations on the same playing field</text>
  <text start="511.81" dur="5.4">have everything centralized where they</text>
  <text start="514.479" dur="5.011">can control everything all of that is</text>
  <text start="517.21" dur="5.16">falling apart right now and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="519.49" dur="7.95">like it and it&amp;#39;s ending very very</text>
  <text start="522.37" dur="8.07">quickly now the Russian bank temp</text>
  <text start="527.44" dur="5.25">Bank well that has been cut off from the</text>
  <text start="530.44" dur="4.41">international system for the exchange of</text>
  <text start="532.69" dur="5.1">financial data that is the Swift system</text>
  <text start="534.85" dur="5.55">and the bank has been disconnected from</text>
  <text start="537.79" dur="5.43">Swift after the management of the credit</text>
  <text start="540.4" dur="5.73">organization fell under US sanctions now</text>
  <text start="543.22" dur="5.64">10 bank open correspondent accounts for</text>
  <text start="546.13" dur="5.97">the Iranian central bank and a number of</text>
  <text start="548.86" dur="4.47">other large banks and basically because</text>
  <text start="552.1" dur="3.63">of the sanctions and everything else</text>
  <text start="553.33" dur="5.82">they were cut off but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="555.73" dur="6.36">is that this Bank and over 300 Russian</text>
  <text start="559.15" dur="6.21">banks they are using the new Russian</text>
  <text start="562.09" dur="5.52">payment system SPFs which was created</text>
  <text start="565.36" dur="5.04">within the BRIC system and they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="567.61" dur="5.61">that system instead of the Swift and</text>
  <text start="570.4" dur="7.35">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this move</text>
  <text start="573.22" dur="7.29">from one system to another and as more</text>
  <text start="577.75" dur="5.19">and more banks come online we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="580.51" dur="7.81">to see that they never really needed the</text>
  <text start="582.94" dur="7.78">Swift and this is being done in China in</text>
  <text start="588.32" dur="3.78">Russia and many and many of the BRIC</text>
  <text start="590.72" dur="4.8">nations they&amp;#39;re all doing this because</text>
  <text start="592.1" dur="5.85">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a transfer of the</text>
  <text start="595.52" dur="5.6">West&amp;#39;s system over to the east because</text>
  <text start="597.95" dur="8.07">what these nations see is the dollar</text>
  <text start="601.12" dur="7.24">dying as the dollar dies the new system</text>
  <text start="606.02" dur="5.25">is coming online and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="608.36" dur="8.22">what we&amp;#39;re seeing now the deep state the</text>
  <text start="611.27" dur="6.89">elite these different factions some are</text>
  <text start="616.58" dur="5.97">saying they&amp;#39;re one in the same</text>
  <text start="618.16" dur="7.3">they are still pushing their agenda now</text>
  <text start="622.55" dur="4.95">if you see out in North Korea they are</text>
  <text start="625.46" dur="3.63">still pushing the agenda there they want</text>
  <text start="627.5" dur="3.24">war Venezuela</text>
  <text start="629.09" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re still trying to meet their goal</text>
  <text start="630.74" dur="5.16">of having regime change taking control</text>
  <text start="633.38" dur="5.19">event as well and now Trump is out there</text>
  <text start="635.9" dur="4.05">and he&amp;#39;s saying yes we are threatening</text>
  <text start="638.57" dur="4.02">to attack Venezuela and you have to</text>
  <text start="639.95" dur="7.68">listen to his words very very carefully</text>
  <text start="642.59" dur="7.26">he is going along with the deep state</text>
  <text start="647.63" dur="2.4">agenda on purpose and it looks like to</text>
  <text start="649.85" dur="2.43">me</text>
  <text start="650.03" dur="4.53">we have Tillerson and Trump it looks</text>
  <text start="652.28" dur="4.11">like we have good-cop bad-cop and it</text>
  <text start="654.56" dur="4.53">looks like Trump is playing the part of</text>
  <text start="656.39" dur="4.47">bad cop where he&amp;#39;s saying yes you know</text>
  <text start="659.09" dur="5.31">North Korea is going to feel the wrath</text>
  <text start="660.86" dur="6.18">of the United States if they attack yes</text>
  <text start="664.4" dur="5.67">we&amp;#39;re going to use some type of military</text>
  <text start="667.04" dur="5.43">operation in Venezuela if they don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="670.07" dur="4.41">what we say yes we&amp;#39;re going to play</text>
  <text start="672.47" dur="4.5">sanctions on Russia and then we have</text>
  <text start="674.48" dur="4.62">Tillerson saying no listen we can have a</text>
  <text start="676.97" dur="4.68">diplomatic approach to this we can find</text>
  <text start="679.1" dur="5.13">a different solution and Trump is trying</text>
  <text start="681.65" dur="3.6">to stay away from this because he&amp;#39;s he</text>
  <text start="684.23" dur="5.01">doesn&amp;#39;t want the corporate media</text>
  <text start="685.25" dur="6.03">latching on to oh he&amp;#39;s part of Russia oh</text>
  <text start="689.24" dur="4.35">he&amp;#39;s going along with Russia who wants</text>
  <text start="691.28" dur="4.5">Venezuela to thrive he&amp;#39;s going along</text>

  <text start="1094.9" dur="8.38">peaceful good life and once all of this</text>
  <text start="1100.46" dur="4.95">started everything changed now who</text>
  <text start="1103.28" dur="4.89">started this again it was the United</text>
  <text start="1105.41" dur="5.16">States and coalition forces basically</text>
  <text start="1108.17" dur="5.01">what they&amp;#39;re saying there is that we had</text>
