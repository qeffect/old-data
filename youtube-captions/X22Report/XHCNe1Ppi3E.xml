  <text start="30.619" dur="6.301">is Dave and this is episode 163 and</text>
  <text start="33.23" dur="6.36">today&amp;#39;s date is September 14 2013 and</text>
  <text start="36.92" dur="5.639">the title of this is Saturday Karn</text>
  <text start="39.59" dur="4.59">economic collapse news brief and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="42.559" dur="3.421">get right into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="44.18" dur="5.55">news and we&amp;#39;re going to go out to Poland</text>
  <text start="45.98" dur="6.36">now Poland they are marching for jobs</text>
  <text start="49.73" dur="5.25">you know because the entire world is</text>
  <text start="52.34" dur="4.859">doing well Europe is doing fine America</text>
  <text start="54.98" dur="6.509">is doing fine but we have people out</text>
  <text start="57.199" dur="7.68">there who are marching for better and/or</text>
  <text start="61.489" dur="5.611">just jobs this goes on to say that tens</text>
  <text start="64.879" dur="4.141">of thousands of protesters marched</text>
  <text start="67.1" dur="4.29">through the Polish capital on Saturday</text>
  <text start="69.02" dur="5.37">in one of the largest demonstrations and</text>
  <text start="71.39" dur="6.45">years to demand more jobs and higher pay</text>
  <text start="74.39" dur="6.03">and they are blaming the government</text>
  <text start="77.84" dur="5.25">which is failing to tackle their high</text>
  <text start="80.42" dur="4.83">unemployment at this point and their</text>
  <text start="83.09" dur="5.52">unemployment right now stands at</text>
  <text start="85.25" dur="6.54">thirteen point one percent and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="88.61" dur="7.29">expected to go higher so we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="91.79" dur="7.17">that there are countries out there that</text>
  <text start="95.9" dur="5.4">are feeling the strain of their</text>
  <text start="98.96" dur="5.07">population being unemployed we have</text>
  <text start="101.3" dur="7.32">Greece we have Cyprus we have Italy</text>
  <text start="104.03" dur="7.02">France Spain the US England Australia</text>
  <text start="108.62" dur="6.36">starting to see it where all of these</text>
  <text start="111.05" dur="6.72">countries are seeing some high single</text>
  <text start="114.98" dur="6.27">digit and some very high double-digit</text>
  <text start="117.77" dur="5.52">unemployment right now and this is just</text>
  <text start="121.25" dur="5.25">going to get worse because again the</text>
  <text start="123.29" dur="5.73">debt cannot be sustained when there are</text>
  <text start="126.5" dur="4.92">people out of work and the debt</text>
  <text start="129.02" dur="4.23">continually piles up and they need the</text>
  <text start="131.42" dur="3.78">revenue but they need more money to</text>
  <text start="133.25" dur="4.29">sustain the debt they borrow the money</text>
  <text start="135.2" dur="4.289">with conditions of laying off people and</text>
  <text start="137.54" dur="3.059">those people are no longer contributing</text>
  <text start="139.489" dur="6">to the debt</text>
  <text start="140.599" dur="7.741">so it&amp;#39;s a completely ridiculous cycle</text>
  <text start="145.489" dur="3.86">that this goes into and there is no</text>
  <text start="148.34" dur="3.42">escape from it</text>
  <text start="149.349" dur="3.79">and it just gets worse and worse and</text>
  <text start="151.76" dur="5.069">worse and that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re seeing Greece</text>
  <text start="153.139" dur="6.091">is on its third bailout already because</text>
  <text start="156.829" dur="3.901">it&amp;#39;s proven that it does not work and</text>
  <text start="159.23" dur="4.53">their unemployment continually to rise</text>
  <text start="160.73" dur="4.83">and now we&amp;#39;re seeing Poland the people</text>
  <text start="163.76" dur="4.259">are getting frustrated of not having</text>
  <text start="165.56" dur="4.5">work and that they&amp;#39;re marching now to</text>
  <text start="168.019" dur="5.881">show the government what they think and</text>
  <text start="170.06" dur="6.84">what they want now India is seeking to</text>
  <text start="173.9" dur="6.419">increase their oil imports from Iran</text>
  <text start="176.9" dur="5.1">which is bypassing the dollar and this</text>
  <text start="180.319" dur="5.431">is why the sanctions were put in place</text>
  <text start="182" dur="5.43">by the u.s. to try to hurt Iran because</text>
  <text start="185.75" dur="3">you know they believe they&amp;#39;re three to</text>
  <text start="187.43" dur="4.11">five years out from making a nuclear</text>
  <text start="188.75" dur="6.299">bomb which has been in the making for 25</text>
  <text start="191.54" dur="7.86">plus years and they&amp;#39;ve never produced or</text>
  <text start="195.049" dur="7.701">used any type of such bomb but right</text>
  <text start="199.4" dur="6.479">here India is purchasing even more oil</text>
  <text start="202.75" dur="9.609">from Iran and it&amp;#39;s bypassing the dollar</text>
  <text start="205.879" dur="9.6">using the Indian rupee to purchase the</text>
  <text start="212.359" dur="6.571">oil and this is why these central</text>
  <text start="215.479" dur="5.611">bankers u.s. government wants Iran and</text>
  <text start="218.93" dur="4.38">Syria they want to get in there and</text>
  <text start="221.09" dur="4.619">replace those governments put them on</text>
  <text start="223.31" dur="5.22">the US dollar as a reserve currency and</text>
  <text start="225.709" dur="5.7">set up private western central banks and</text>
  <text start="228.53" dur="5.01">this is the entire purpose for all this</text>
  <text start="231.409" dur="7.381">they&amp;#39;ve done it in Yemen they&amp;#39;ve done it</text>
  <text start="233.54" dur="8.669">in Libya Lebanon Iraq Somalia they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="238.79" dur="5.939">done it in more countries than I just</text>
  <text start="242.209" dur="5.4">mentioned but they are continually</text>
  <text start="244.729" dur="4.98">keeping control of all these countries</text>
  <text start="247.609" dur="4.71">controlling the natural resources and</text>
  <text start="249.709" dur="4.7">making sure the US dollar is used</text>
  <text start="252.319" dur="5.01">because if they cannot do this</text>
  <text start="254.409" dur="5.11">everything comes crumbling down and</text>
  <text start="257.329" dur="4.77">eventually this will prop up the system</text>
  <text start="259.519" dur="4.77">if they&amp;#39;re able to do it for a little</text>
  <text start="262.099" dur="4.921">while longer but eventually it will all</text>
  <text start="264.289" dur="5.041">start to erode and it we will have a</text>
  <text start="267.02" dur="4.47">collapse and the other reason they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="269.33" dur="3.809">doing this is because they know the</text>
  <text start="271.49" dur="2.179">collapse is right around the corner if</text>
  <text start="273.139" dur="3.171">they</text>
  <text start="273.669" dur="6.15">do this and if they can start this war</text>
  <text start="276.31" dur="4.859">this could cover up the entire collapse</text>
  <text start="279.819" dur="3.72">because they can blame it on another</text>
  <text start="281.169" dur="6.12">country saying that they are - they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="283.539" dur="5.91">at fault for what the u.s. is feeling</text>
  <text start="287.289" dur="6.72">right now and this is why they are doing</text>
  <text start="289.449" dur="7.05">this now Eric Sprott believes that the</text>
  <text start="294.009" dur="5.551">Chinese Japanese and a lot of the</text>
  <text start="296.499" dur="4.44">emerging countries are selling US bonds</text>
  <text start="299.56" dur="5.669">and we understand that</text>
  <text start="300.939" dur="7.111">China is selling their Treasury bonds</text>
  <text start="305.229" dur="4.921">and we realize that these countries are</text>
  <text start="308.05" dur="3.959">going to sell a lot more of it and I</text>
  <text start="310.15" dur="4.71">know the Fed is talking about tapering</text>
  <text start="312.009" dur="4.861">they might even start the taper but we</text>
  <text start="314.86" dur="4.98">will have some type of an event that</text>
  <text start="316.87" dur="5.909">will occur where tapering will be off</text>
  <text start="319.84" dur="5.34">the table countries will start selling</text>
  <text start="322.779" dur="4.17">their Treasury bonds and the US</text>
  <text start="325.18" dur="3.509">government Fed will come out saying</text>
  <text start="326.949" dur="3.541">because of what these other countries</text>
  <text start="328.689" dur="4.53">are doing and because we&amp;#39;re going to war</text>
  <text start="330.49" dur="6.66">and many other things we need to</text>
  <text start="333.219" dur="8.431">increase the printing or the creation of</text>
  <text start="337.15" dur="6.87">money and they will do this to purchase</text>
  <text start="341.65" dur="4.489">those bonds that are being sold because</text>
  <text start="344.02" dur="4.44">bonds that are being sold</text>
  <text start="346.139" dur="6.25">someone&amp;#39;s got to buy them and right now</text>
  <text start="348.46" dur="9.079">the Fed has been purchasing 90% or so of</text>
  <text start="352.389" dur="8.911">the Treasury bonds at this point now</text>
  <text start="357.539" dur="6.041">going to Syria and looking at the</text>
  <text start="361.3" dur="5.28">situation we understand that the</text>
  <text start="363.58" dur="5.549">American people were not for this war we</text>
  <text start="366.58" dur="4.47">understand Congress was not for this war</text>
  <text start="369.129" dur="5.431">and there was a survey out from the</text>
  <text start="371.05" dur="7.799">military times saying that 75% of the</text>
  <text start="374.56" dur="7.05">troops oppose strikes of Syria and we</text>
  <text start="378.849" dur="5.55">have to remember the president who calls</text>
  <text start="381.61" dur="5.94">himself the commander-in-chief doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="384.399" dur="5.58">even have the backing of the military at</text>
  <text start="387.55" dur="5.13">this point and this goes on to say that</text>
  <text start="389.979" dur="4.92">a military time survey of more than 750</text>
  <text start="392.68" dur="4.82">active duty troops this week found</text>
  <text start="394.899" dur="7.911">servicemembers oppose military action in</text>
  <text start="397.5" dur="7.839">Syria and this is a huge huge blow to</text>
  <text start="402.81" dur="4.57">President Obama where he doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="405.339" dur="4.051">have the support of the military</text>
  <text start="407.38" dur="6.06">this is why everything has been called</text>
  <text start="409.39" dur="7.11">off at this time but not called off</text>
  <text start="413.44" dur="6.45">permanently this is just a little hitch</text>
  <text start="416.5" dur="5.73">or glitch in their plan and they will be</text>
  <text start="419.89" dur="4.56">making other arrangements to get this</text>
  <text start="422.23" dur="4.53">war started we&amp;#39;ve already seen them with</text>
  <text start="424.45" dur="5.58">al Qaeda coming out which is you know a</text>
  <text start="426.76" dur="5.1">CIA paid operative group saying that</text>
  <text start="430.03" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re going to attack the u.s. because</text>
  <text start="431.86" dur="4.32">the best way for the central bankers</text>
  <text start="433.93" dur="4.77">u.s. government to get a war started is</text>
  <text start="436.18" dur="9.06">to bring it to US soil and let the</text>
  <text start="438.7" dur="8.4">people feel what what the people in what</text>
  <text start="445.24" dur="3.84">they tried to produce with the chemical</text>
  <text start="447.1" dur="3.93">weapons but no one here really in the</text>
  <text start="449.08" dur="4.14">u.s. really felt it so if they bring</text>
  <text start="451.03" dur="6">some type of false flag here like 9/11</text>
  <text start="453.22" dur="6">their people feel it people understand</text>
  <text start="457.03" dur="5.4">it and then people will start begging</text>
  <text start="459.22" dur="5.94">for the US government to attack whatever</text>
  <text start="462.43" dur="4.83">country they name that did this false</text>
  <text start="465.16" dur="4.86">flag and we can see they are building up</text>
  <text start="467.26" dur="5.55">the propaganda with more cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="470.02" dur="5.85">with al Qaeda coming out with this lone</text>
  <text start="472.81" dur="5.4">wolf al Qaeda groups that are forming</text>
  <text start="475.87" dur="3.78">and we can see that this is what the</text>
  <text start="478.21" dur="5.57">agenda that they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="479.65" dur="9.48">forward to get this war started and</text>
  <text start="483.78" dur="11.95">right now Kerry and Lavrov have agreed</text>
  <text start="489.13" dur="9.51">on the Syrian chemical - to destroy the</text>
  <text start="495.73" dur="6.6">chemical weapons and there are a couple</text>
  <text start="498.64" dur="7.44">points here that they that they want</text>
  <text start="502.33" dur="6.87">them to do they want the Syrian regime</text>
  <text start="506.08" dur="5.46">has one week until September 21st to</text>
  <text start="509.2" dur="3.899">submit a comprehensive listing including</text>
  <text start="511.54" dur="4.11">names types and quantities of its</text>
  <text start="513.099" dur="4.44">chemical weapons right now there&amp;#39;s a 40%</text>
  <text start="515.65" dur="4.04">disparity between the US and Russian</text>
  <text start="517.539" dur="4.081">assessment of the chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="519.69" dur="3.789">inspectors must be on the ground by</text>
  <text start="521.62" dur="4.07">November and the destruction of the</text>
  <text start="523.479" dur="4.351">chemical weapons completed by mid-2014</text>
  <text start="525.69" dur="4.36">Syria must provide immediate and</text>
  <text start="527.83" dur="6.75">unfettered access to its chemical</text>
  <text start="530.05" dur="8.34">weapons sites and they need all this</text>
  <text start="534.58" dur="6.78">done or the US will strike and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="538.39" dur="6.03">what this says and Obama was out there</text>
  <text start="541.36" dur="5.31">today saying that US remains prepared to</text>
  <text start="544.42" dur="5.099">act on Syria he&amp;#39;s keeping the fleet</text>
  <text start="546.67" dur="5.099">there he&amp;#39;s not backing off and if they</text>
  <text start="549.519" dur="4.471">do not follow through on their promise</text>
  <text start="551.769" dur="4.711">to surrender all chemical weapons they</text>
  <text start="553.99" dur="5.159">will face a military strike so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="556.48" dur="4.65">keeping that on the table continually</text>
  <text start="559.149" dur="4.291">brainwashing everyone to make them</text>
  <text start="561.13" dur="4.47">believe that we are ready the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="563.44" dur="4.2">ready to strike and keeping this in</text>
  <text start="565.6" dur="4.56">everyone&amp;#39;s mind so when the false flag</text>
  <text start="567.64" dur="4.439">happens here in the United States people</text>
  <text start="570.16" dur="4.98">all they hear is strike strike strike</text>
  <text start="572.079" dur="6.69">and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="575.14" dur="5.43">now as I said in the past the UN arms</text>
  <text start="578.769" dur="4.26">treaty gun bill are pending in the</text>
  <text start="580.57" dur="5.54">Senate the president has already created</text>
  <text start="583.029" dur="7.471">the executive orders that will support</text>
  <text start="586.11" dur="6.729">those bills so they already believe that</text>
  <text start="590.5" dur="4.95">these bills are already passed in their</text>
  <text start="592.839" dur="4.74">minds they&amp;#39;re there they&amp;#39;re good but</text>
  <text start="595.45" dur="7.139">again they will do everything and</text>
  <text start="597.579" dur="8.82">everything to stop people from acquiring</text>
  <text start="602.589" dur="6.99">weapons and they are trying and doing</text>
  <text start="606.399" dur="4.5">everything they can to disarm the people</text>
  <text start="609.579" dur="5.421">of their weapons because their biggest</text>
  <text start="610.899" dur="7.111">fear is to have the people rise up and</text>
  <text start="615" dur="5.92">kick out the present government that</text>
  <text start="618.01" dur="4.98">that we have right now and the only way</text>
  <text start="620.92" dur="4.05">they know how to do this is with</text>
  <text start="622.99" dur="4.08">continually putting thousands of</text>
  <text start="624.97" dur="4.23">different laws on the books trying to</text>
  <text start="627.07" dur="4.56">make it harder and harder to purchase a</text>
  <text start="629.2" dur="4.98">weapon and the newest one is a massive</text>
  <text start="631.63" dur="5.01">gun tax and I said this in my previous</text>
  <text start="634.18" dur="6.24">reports every time you see more military</text>
  <text start="636.64" dur="9.12">drills more taxes more laws that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="640.42" dur="7.47">make sense that remove your rights the</text>
  <text start="645.76" dur="4.47">collapse is getting closer and closer</text>
  <text start="647.89" dur="4.65">closer and right now what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="650.23" dur="7.349">is they&amp;#39;re going to increase the federal</text>
  <text start="652.54" dur="7.44">excise tax on handguns from 11% to 20%</text>
  <text start="657.579" dur="7.88">they&amp;#39;re going to increase the federal</text>
  <text start="659.98" dur="9.2">excise tax on ammunition from 11% to 50%</text>
  <text start="665.459" dur="9.13">they&amp;#39;re going to increase the NFA tax</text>
  <text start="669.18" dur="5.97">from $200 to $500 and this goes on and</text>
  <text start="674.589" dur="2.901">on and on</text>
  <text start="675.15" dur="4.65">and they are trying to make it very very</text>
  <text start="677.49" dur="4.65">difficult to purchase or very expensive</text>
  <text start="679.8" dur="4.76">to purchase ammunition and weapons and</text>
  <text start="682.14" dur="5.37">this is one way they&amp;#39;re trying to limit</text>
  <text start="684.56" dur="4">what the people are able to do and again</text>
  <text start="687.51" dur="3.02">we have to remember what the Second</text>
  <text start="688.56" dur="5.34">Amendment says the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="690.53" dur="5.11">shall not infringe means shall not limit</text>
  <text start="693.9" dur="3.93">and what they&amp;#39;re doing is they are</text>
  <text start="695.64" dur="4.11">limiting they&amp;#39;re making it difficult</text>
  <text start="697.83" dur="4.89">because they understand what is coming</text>
  <text start="699.75" dur="5.52">and that&amp;#39;s why they had the NDA NDAA in</text>
  <text start="702.72" dur="4.86">place that&amp;#39;s why they created the DHS</text>
  <text start="705.27" dur="6.77">that&amp;#39;s why they have TSA that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
