  <text start="136.47" dur="7.94">the plan it&amp;#39;s not just political it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="140.54" dur="7">economics also this is why Trump is</text>

  <text start="159.569" dur="6.211">thing that they accomplished</text>
  <text start="162" dur="7.35">builds upon what they needed to move</text>
  <text start="165.78" dur="8.1">forward now let&amp;#39;s take for example the</text>
  <text start="169.35" dur="6.53">UK we know that Trump the Patriots and</text>
  <text start="173.88" dur="5.79">they needed the UK to break free from</text>
  <text start="175.88" dur="7">the EU this has been planned quite a</text>
  <text start="179.67" dur="4.85">while ago and here we have Boris Johnson</text>
  <text start="182.88" dur="4.11">winning the election</text>
  <text start="184.52" dur="9.04">Trump would like to make a trade deal</text>
  <text start="186.99" dur="12.99">with the UK and the EU always stands in</text>
  <text start="193.56" dur="9.44">the way the EU right now they are their</text>
  <text start="199.98" dur="5.58">hands are tied because of the WTO ruling</text>
  <text start="203" dur="6.97">remember that ruling with the Airbus and</text>
  <text start="205.56" dur="8.97">Boeing because Europe tried to cut</text>

  <text start="214.53" dur="4.2">States says this these are unfair</text>
  <text start="216.15" dur="5.63">practices that hurt Boeing well the WTO</text>
  <text start="218.73" dur="8.85">ruled in favor of the United States</text>
  <text start="221.78" dur="8.98">which means the US can place tariffs on</text>
  <text start="227.58" dur="5.54">the EU they can&amp;#39;t retaliate against the</text>
  <text start="230.76" dur="2.36">United States</text>

  <text start="241.47" dur="6.06">also going to put pressure on the EU now</text>
  <text start="245.519" dur="4.951">this is all being done on purpose</text>
  <text start="247.53" dur="5.76">remember the EU is a bunch of central</text>
  <text start="250.47" dur="7.65">bankers these are non elected leaders</text>
  <text start="253.29" dur="6.569">and they are the central bank system</text>
  <text start="258.12" dur="3.63">part of it there&amp;#39;s many other central</text>
  <text start="259.859" dur="5.241">banks but remember Rothschilds are on</text>
  <text start="261.75" dur="6.36">top now the office of US Trade</text>
  <text start="265.1" dur="5.47">Representative has published a new list</text>
  <text start="268.11" dur="4.26">of additional European products that</text>

  <text start="281.43" dur="6.81">April of 2019 and july 2019 the extended</text>
  <text start="285.6" dur="5.28">list is weighing the idea that 100%</text>
  <text start="288.24" dur="4.91">tariffs could be seen on products from</text>
  <text start="290.88" dur="4.55">almost every country in Europe</text>
  <text start="293.15" dur="5.07">some of these products include whiskey&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="295.43" dur="5.79">virgin oil virgin olive oil yogurt</text>
  <text start="298.22" dur="7.53">cheese knives tools liquors and dozens</text>
  <text start="301.22" dur="6.6">of other products and the USTR added</text>
  <text start="305.75" dur="4.44">that the United States is initiating a</text>
  <text start="307.82" dur="4.74">process to assess increasing the tariffs</text>
  <text start="310.19" dur="4.32">rates and subjecting additional EU</text>
  <text start="312.56" dur="5.19">products to the tariffs because Europe</text>
  <text start="314.51" dur="7.83">has failed to decrease the subsidies to</text>
  <text start="317.75" dur="8.19">its manufacturers and remember there is</text>
  <text start="322.34" dur="8.04">no appeals court in the WTO right now</text>
  <text start="325.94" dur="9.78">Trump has not appointed enough judges so</text>
  <text start="330.38" dur="10.2">right now they cannot appeal so Europe</text>
  <text start="335.72" dur="7.65">is not abiding by the WTO rules and now</text>
  <text start="340.58" dur="6.089">they&amp;#39;re putting pressure on Europe once</text>
  <text start="343.37" dur="5.01">the brexit happens in January Trump and</text>
  <text start="346.669" dur="4.62">Boris Johnson are going to make an</text>
  <text start="348.38" dur="4.59">incredible trade deal trade is gonna</text>
  <text start="351.289" dur="4.651">flow through the UK</text>
  <text start="352.97" dur="6.24">there&amp;#39;ll be tariffs on the rest of</text>
  <text start="355.94" dur="6.36">Europe so I&amp;#39;m assuming that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="359.21" dur="6.09">gonna divert a lot of the trade into the</text>
  <text start="362.3" dur="6.57">UK the UK is going to have a trade deal</text>
  <text start="365.3" dur="4.98">with the United States this is all part</text>
  <text start="368.87" dur="4.47">of the plan it&amp;#39;s putting a lot of</text>
  <text start="370.28" dur="5.73">pressure on the central bank system now</text>
  <text start="373.34" dur="7.829">we need to remember that Trump went</text>
  <text start="376.01" dur="8.219">ahead and he made the phase 1 deal China</text>
  <text start="381.169" dur="4.861">has agreed to a 40 billion agricultural</text>
  <text start="384.229" dur="4.651">purchase from the u.s. in exchange for</text>
  <text start="386.03" dur="5.54">that purchase Trump will be maintaining</text>
  <text start="388.88" dur="5.03">the full 25% tariffs on approximately</text>
  <text start="391.57" dur="6.279">250 billion of Chinese and points and</text>
  <text start="393.91" dur="5.83">reducing to 7.5% the tariffs on</text>
  <text start="397.849" dur="4.981">approximately 120 billion of Chinese</text>
  <text start="399.74" dur="5.91">imports this will be in round 2 those</text>
  <text start="402.83" dur="5.07">were 15 percent prior to reduction the</text>
  <text start="405.65" dur="5.43">net difference dropping from 15 percent</text>
  <text start="407.9" dur="5.699">to 7.5% is around 9 billion in tariffs</text>
  <text start="411.08" dur="5.1">relief additionally the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="413.599" dur="4.951">suspending the December 15th tariff</text>
  <text start="416.18" dur="5.22">pending a compliance verification with</text>
  <text start="418.55" dur="5.549">the non-tariff issues and China pledges</text>
  <text start="421.4" dur="3.39">and this is from the conservative tree</text>
  <text start="424.099" dur="3.401">house</text>
  <text start="424.79" dur="6.4">Beijing has agreed to allow US banks</text>
  <text start="427.5" dur="6.99">access to their financial markets reform</text>
  <text start="431.19" dur="5.63">their behavior on IP theft stop the</text>
  <text start="434.49" dur="4.5">forced transfer of Technology and</text>
  <text start="436.82" dur="4.42">according to their promises allow</text>
  <text start="438.99" dur="5.19">exclusive ownership of US business</text>
  <text start="441.24" dur="5.7">businesses within China these are the</text>
  <text start="444.18" dur="6.45">non-tariff issues however these are</text>
  <text start="446.94" dur="6.3">promises so far Trump of the Patriots we</text>
  <text start="450.63" dur="5.1">know this we know a lot of times China</text>
  <text start="453.24" dur="4.47">doesn&amp;#39;t keep their promises but Trump is</text>
  <text start="455.73" dur="4.26">really not worried about that because</text>
  <text start="457.71" dur="4.17">he&amp;#39;s gonna continue with the tariffs</text>
  <text start="459.99" dur="5.91">because he&amp;#39;s gonna continually put</text>
  <text start="461.88" dur="8.4">pressure on companies inside of China</text>
  <text start="465.9" dur="9.27">and Trump doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily want China</text>
  <text start="470.28" dur="8.1">to comply with everything he would like</text>
  <text start="475.17" dur="7.55">to keep the tariffs in place this gives</text>
  <text start="478.38" dur="6.75">him leverage the goal is to D couple</text>
  <text start="482.72" dur="5.08">from China</text>
  <text start="485.13" dur="4.89">remember the globalists set this up</text>
  <text start="487.8" dur="4.53">where we were linked with China that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="490.02" dur="6.21">where the manufacturing was we&amp;#39;re buying</text>
  <text start="492.33" dur="8.88">their goods Trump it he&amp;#39;s his plan is to</text>
  <text start="496.23" dur="7.53">decouple us from China and he would like</text>
  <text start="501.21" dur="4.74">to have companies moved out of China</text>
  <text start="503.76" dur="3.87">which is happening he would like him all</text>
  <text start="505.95" dur="4.29">come back to the United States but we</text>
  <text start="507.63" dur="6.24">don&amp;#39;t have that much time this is why he</text>
  <text start="510.24" dur="6.15">put he&amp;#39;s putting forth the u.s. MCA in</text>
  <text start="513.87" dur="5.82">the bigger picture Trump wants the US</text>
  <text start="516.39" dur="4.649">companies to leave I mean the decoupling</text>
  <text start="519.69" dur="4.65">right now it&amp;#39;s already underway</text>
  <text start="521.039" dur="5.641">Trump is creating new supply chains and</text>
  <text start="524.34" dur="6.12">manufacturing opportunities within the</text>
  <text start="526.68" dur="5.72">US MCA now when you really look at the</text>
  <text start="530.46" dur="6.33">big picture of what just happened here</text>
  <text start="532.4" dur="6.1">Trump decided to do away with the</text>
  <text start="536.79" dur="6.54">terrace which is a nine billion dollar</text>
  <text start="538.5" dur="9.9">loss but he gained 40 billion with phase</text>
  <text start="543.33" dur="9.42">one for the US farmers I believe this is</text>
  <text start="548.4" dur="8.189">a win for Trump for the u.s. for the</text>
  <text start="552.75" dur="5.52">farmers and remember the plan is not to</text>
  <text start="556.589" dur="3.631">make nice-nice and just</text>
  <text start="558.27" dur="3.74">have everything ironed out here because</text>

  <text start="572.43" dur="4.349">doing right now</text>
  <text start="573.18" dur="7.8">he&amp;#39;s decoupling everything that they</text>
  <text start="576.779" dur="6.241">have done and he&amp;#39;s setting up a Mandarin</text>
