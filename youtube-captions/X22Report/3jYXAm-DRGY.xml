  <text start="101.11" dur="8.49">right now we also see that gold was</text>
  <text start="105.64" dur="7.619">slammed for the second day in a row very</text>
  <text start="109.6" dur="6.14">interesting and they went ahead and they</text>
  <text start="113.259" dur="5.521">dumped three billion of notional</text>
  <text start="115.74" dur="5.68">contracts future contracts ahead of the</text>
  <text start="118.78" dur="4.65">London fix and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="121.42" dur="5.19">now this is about 25,000 contracts</text>
  <text start="123.43" dur="5.43">dumped in a minute and it failed think</text>
  <text start="126.61" dur="5.969">about this for a second it failed to</text>
  <text start="128.86" dur="7.02">keep the precious metal down gold then</text>
  <text start="132.579" dur="6.931">pop back up now despite the second slam</text>
  <text start="135.88" dur="6.84">we can see that trading in gold right</text>
  <text start="139.51" dur="6.21">now is near the highest in five months</text>
  <text start="142.72" dur="6.75">which tells us something that these</text>
  <text start="145.72" dur="7.71">slams maybe they&amp;#39;re not working as well</text>
  <text start="149.47" dur="6.48">as they wanted remember what I said when</text>
  <text start="153.43" dur="5.19">we start to see gold being slammed down</text>
  <text start="155.95" dur="5.73">and they&amp;#39;re doing it multiple times and</text>
  <text start="158.62" dur="4.44">maybe they&amp;#39;ll be using larger contracts</text>
  <text start="161.68" dur="3.839">in the larger number of contracts to</text>
  <text start="163.06" dur="4.26">bring the gold down and it doesn&amp;#39;t stay</text>
  <text start="165.519" dur="5.131">down and they can&amp;#39;t do it anymore</text>
  <text start="167.32" dur="6.72">things are starting to break and if we</text>
  <text start="170.65" dur="6">see gold start going up 50 $100 as they</text>
  <text start="174.04" dur="5.37">bring it down well that is your sign</text>
  <text start="176.65" dur="4.14">because that tells you that it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="179.41" dur="1.68">to be very difficult to purchase any</text>
  <text start="180.79" dur="2.58">type</text>
  <text start="181.09" dur="3.39">gold or silver moving forward because</text>
  <text start="183.37" dur="3.18">things are gonna really start getting</text>
  <text start="184.48" dur="4.17">out of whack will it happen the next day</text>
  <text start="186.55" dur="3.81">no but in the next couple of weeks next</text>
  <text start="188.65" dur="4.26">month or so you&amp;#39;re gonna see things</text>
  <text start="190.36" dur="3.989">rapidly change and it will become</text>
  <text start="192.91" dur="3.84">different now I think about cliff high</text>
  <text start="194.349" dur="4.711">when he says that Silver&amp;#39;s gonna you</text>
  <text start="196.75" dur="4.379">know pop up then it&amp;#39;s going to be pushed</text>
  <text start="199.06" dur="4.17">back down it&amp;#39;s gonna pop up again and</text>
  <text start="201.129" dur="4.47">come August it&amp;#39;s really gonna let loose</text>
  <text start="203.23" dur="5.1">well I can see how this is all playing</text>
  <text start="205.599" dur="5.731">into that right now and how we are</text>
  <text start="208.33" dur="5.67">definitely moving into that arena which</text>
  <text start="211.33" dur="5.07">tells us that people need to get ready</text>
  <text start="214" dur="4.319">and prepared for what is coming out Bix</text>
  <text start="216.4" dur="4.199">we&amp;#39;re in the saying that silver is a</text>
  <text start="218.319" dur="5.131">better investment that good than gold</text>
  <text start="220.599" dur="5.131">now many people can&amp;#39;t afford an ounce of</text>
  <text start="223.45" dur="3.75">gold today many people can afford an</text>
  <text start="225.73" dur="5.25">ounce of silver an ounce and if silver</text>
  <text start="227.2" dur="6.33">is about $18 $19 $20 around that range</text>
  <text start="230.98" dur="6.27">you can even afford half an ounce of</text>
  <text start="233.53" dur="6">silver or a quarter ounce of silver I</text>
  <text start="237.25" dur="4.44">mean if you go out to Starbucks or to</text>
  <text start="239.53" dur="4.14">Dunkin Donuts or any of those places and</text>
  <text start="241.69" dur="5.669">you buy a cup of coffee you can afford</text>
  <text start="243.67" dur="7.469">some silver so we could see right now</text>
  <text start="247.359" dur="6.391">you should be purchasing some silver I</text>
  <text start="251.139" dur="4.621">purchase a lot more silver than gold</text>
  <text start="253.75" dur="4.109">I don&amp;#39;t even purchase an ounce of gold I</text>
  <text start="255.76" dur="3.839">don&amp;#39;t have that type of funds to</text>
  <text start="257.859" dur="4.62">purchase an ounce so sometimes I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="259.599" dur="4.741">purchase a quarter of gold but most of</text>
  <text start="262.479" dur="4.171">the time I buy one ounce of silver</text>
  <text start="264.34" dur="4.5">because that&amp;#39;s something that fits into</text>
  <text start="266.65" dur="3.84">my budget and I&amp;#39;ve been doing this for</text>
  <text start="268.84" dur="3.87">quite a while those people haven&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="270.49" dur="4.35">doing it you need to start doing this</text>
  <text start="272.71" dur="4.709">now no I don&amp;#39;t sell silver I don&amp;#39;t sell</text>
  <text start="274.84" dur="5.43">gold I don&amp;#39;t sell anything actually but</text>
  <text start="277.419" dur="5.37">what you need to do is you need to go</text>
  <text start="280.27" dur="6.48">out and protect yourself this is your</text>
  <text start="282.789" dur="5.88">insurance from when things go wrong you</text>
  <text start="286.75" dur="4.65">need to have cash you need to have</text>
  <text start="288.669" dur="5.22">silver if you can afford gold have gold</text>
  <text start="291.4" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t be sitting there saying to</text>
  <text start="293.889" dur="2.851">yourself you know something I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="294.76" dur="4.62">wait to see what happens when he says</text>
  <text start="296.74" dur="4.29">that gold and silver when they can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="299.38" dur="5.009">slammed down anymore and they are</text>
  <text start="301.03" dur="5.4">slammed down and gold pops up $100</text>
  <text start="304.389" dur="4.741">that&amp;#39;s when I&amp;#39;m gonna decide to go out</text>
  <text start="306.43" dur="4.799">and get as much as I possibly can well</text>
  <text start="309.13" dur="4.95">at that time it might be too late you</text>
  <text start="311.229" dur="3.751">might be going to the different places</text>
  <text start="314.08" dur="2.73">saying</text>
  <text start="314.98" dur="3.96">I would like you know 100 coins and they</text>
  <text start="316.81" dur="3">might say well huh we got 10 this is all</text>
  <text start="318.94" dur="2.73">you can have right now</text>
  <text start="319.81" dur="3.69">next time you go they might say we have</text>
  <text start="321.67" dur="4.29">none so you don&amp;#39;t want to wait for that</text>
  <text start="323.5" dur="6.39">point in time now we know that the</text>
  <text start="325.96" dur="6.81">central bank is the major problem we can</text>
  <text start="329.89" dur="4.92">raise minimum wage and remember minimum</text>
  <text start="332.77" dur="3.54">wage was really meant for those</text>
  <text start="334.81" dur="4.56">individuals coming out of high school</text>
  <text start="336.31" dur="5.22">those low wage Werner&amp;#39;s earners that</text>
  <text start="339.37" dur="3.93">were gonna move ahead in life and get</text>
  <text start="341.53" dur="4.62">better jobs it wasn&amp;#39;t meant for the</text>
  <text start="343.3" dur="4.02">everyday person to live off of but this</text>
  <text start="346.15" dur="4.23">is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do but</text>
  <text start="347.32" dur="5.16">throughout time what we&amp;#39;ve seen is the</text>
  <text start="350.38" dur="5.28">minimum wage needs to continually move</text>
  <text start="352.48" dur="5.88">up increase because the value of the</text>
  <text start="355.66" dur="4.77">dollar decreases but until we get rid of</text>
  <text start="358.36" dur="3.69">the central bank this is never going to</text>
  <text start="360.43" dur="4.74">change and actually there was a study at</text>
  <text start="362.05" dur="4.8">Harvard and this shocking discovery was</text>
  <text start="365.17" dur="2.88">made when a pair of researchers at</text>
  <text start="366.85" dur="4.11">Harvard Business School decided to</text>
  <text start="368.05" dur="5.73">analyze the impact of higher minimum</text>
  <text start="370.96" dur="5.58">wages in San Francisco on a restaurant</text>
  <text start="373.78" dur="4.71">on restaurant failures and guess what</text>
  <text start="376.54" dur="6.36">happened when they raised the minimum</text>
  <text start="378.49" dur="7.05">wage Restaurant failures went up they</text>
  <text start="382.9" dur="4.35">went up by 4 to 10 percent we can see</text>
  <text start="385.54" dur="4.32">already happen what&amp;#39;s happening with the</text>
  <text start="387.25" dur="4.77">minimum wage with like retail and</text>
  <text start="389.86" dur="4.08">fast-food restaurants they say you know</text>
  <text start="392.02" dur="3.96">something why should I pay $15 an hour</text>
  <text start="393.94" dur="3.75">I&amp;#39;ll just get a computer to do this and</text>
  <text start="395.98" dur="3.15">I don&amp;#39;t have to worry about anything the</text>
  <text start="397.69" dur="3.9">computers always there not showing up</text>
  <text start="399.13" dur="3.99">late to work I don&amp;#39;t the pay the purse</text>
  <text start="401.59" dur="3.96">that that person anymore</text>
  <text start="403.12" dur="4.8">and this works out a lot better so we</text>
  <text start="405.55" dur="2.61">can see this problem will never ever go</text>
  <text start="407.92" dur="3.06">away</text>
  <text start="408.16" dur="4.56">until we get rid of the central bank now</text>
  <text start="410.98" dur="3.12">we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of indicators right</text>
  <text start="412.72" dur="4.77">now letting us know that things are</text>
  <text start="414.1" dur="5.58">rapidly declining IBM right now well</text>
  <text start="417.49" dur="7.44">they went negative to the tune of</text>
  <text start="419.68" dur="8.49">negative 23 123 0.1% now this is the</text>
  <text start="424.93" dur="6">lowest revenue in 15 years is the 20th</text>
  <text start="428.17" dur="4.5">consecutive quarter of declining sales I</text>
  <text start="430.93" dur="3.81">mean and we&amp;#39;re seeing this with</text>
  <text start="432.67" dur="5.55">caterpillar we&amp;#39;re seeing this with many</text>
  <text start="434.74" dur="6.39">many corporations and once this earnings</text>
  <text start="438.22" dur="4.74">period comes up well it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="441.13" dur="3.69">look good now there&amp;#39;s a lot of ways that</text>
  <text start="442.96" dur="4.98">they can manipulate this with gap</text>
  <text start="444.82" dur="4.03">accounting laying off individuals buying</text>
  <text start="447.94" dur="3.31">back their own</text>
  <text start="448.85" dur="4.89">own shares but that is coming to an end</text>
  <text start="451.25" dur="4.38">because when you don&amp;#39;t have the sales</text>
  <text start="453.74" dur="4.47">and you don&amp;#39;t have them for a very long</text>
  <text start="455.63" dur="3.9">time you don&amp;#39;t have the revenue it</text>
  <text start="458.21" dur="4.11">doesn&amp;#39;t really matter at that point</text>
  <text start="459.53" dur="5.73">things are gonna completely change and</text>
  <text start="462.32" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;re already seeing the change we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="465.26" dur="5.22">getting more and more indicators that</text>
  <text start="467.66" dur="5.22">things are rapidly changing right now I</text>
  <text start="470.48" dur="5.19">mean think about it think about a year</text>
  <text start="472.88" dur="4.8">ago two years ago three years ago when</text>
  <text start="475.67" dur="4.35">we talked about housing and retail and</text>
  <text start="477.68" dur="4.02">we talked about how stores were closing</text>
  <text start="480.02" dur="4.11">and the holiday season wasn&amp;#39;t that great</text>
  <text start="481.7" dur="3.54">and the corporate media was trying to</text>
  <text start="484.13" dur="2.64">tell everyone that everything was fine</text>
  <text start="485.24" dur="3.66">Obama was out there telling everyone</text>
  <text start="486.77" dur="4.17">everything that was fine that we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="488.9" dur="4.2">this incredible recovery everything is</text>
  <text start="490.94" dur="3.96">incredible but then we looked at stores</text>
  <text start="493.1" dur="4.14">and we saw well this store is closing</text>
  <text start="494.9" dur="3.9">the store is laying off and everyone</text>
  <text start="497.24" dur="3.9">said oh you&amp;#39;re crazy it&amp;#39;s because of</text>
  <text start="498.8" dur="4.77">online sales and the next year came and</text>
  <text start="501.14" dur="4.5">then we saw more stores closed more</text>
  <text start="503.57" dur="4.68">people getting laid off and they said no</text>
  <text start="505.64" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s the whether its online sales well</text>
  <text start="508.25" dur="4.349">here we are today I mean they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="510.14" dur="4.68">about 3500 stores in the beginning of</text>
  <text start="512.599" dur="5.521">2017 even the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="514.82" dur="5.97">admitting that we have a retail problem</text>
  <text start="518.12" dur="6.09">remember online sales is only a tenth of</text>
  <text start="520.79" dur="5.55">the sales so their entire entire story</text>
  <text start="524.21" dur="4.89">has just fallen apart the weather</text>
  <text start="526.34" dur="4.98">scenario has just fallen apart what</text>
  <text start="529.1" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking all along shows us</text>
  <text start="531.32" dur="4.17">that we were on the right track people</text>
  <text start="533.75" dur="3.81">were losing jobs people couldn&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="535.49" dur="5.76">to go out and purchase the goods they</text>
  <text start="537.56" dur="6.72">built too many stores all of this is the</text>
  <text start="541.25" dur="5.49">problem the central bank is the problem</text>
  <text start="544.28" dur="5.16">and now with the auto man the automobile</text>
  <text start="546.74" dur="5.52">manufacturers we knew they were channel</text>
  <text start="549.44" dur="6.45">stuffing the lots producing cars and</text>
  <text start="552.26" dur="5.55">they count sales as they channel stuff</text>
  <text start="555.89" dur="4.53">the lots not when you purchase the car</text>
  <text start="557.81" dur="4.98">and it looked like manufacturing was up</text>
  <text start="560.42" dur="4.17">looked like sales were up well things</text>
  <text start="562.79" dur="5.22">are starting to change rapidly once</text>
  <text start="564.59" dur="6.45">again we see that Hertz and Avis they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="568.01" dur="5.82">dumped about 400,000 vehicles per year</text>
  <text start="571.04" dur="4.86">into the used car market and they</text>
  <text start="573.83" dur="4.8">operate fleets that are multiple times</text>
  <text start="575.9" dur="5.37">larger and with used cars prices</text>
  <text start="578.63" dur="3.32">plunging bondholders are starting to get</text>
  <text start="581.27" dur="3.23">slight</text>
  <text start="581.95" dur="4.86">anxious about the collateral impact of</text>
  <text start="584.5" dur="4.89">writing down billions of dollars worth</text>
  <text start="586.81" dur="4.5">of capital assets now debt issued by</text>

  <text start="599.62" dur="5.52">vehicle prices are dropping twice as</text>
  <text start="602.05" dur="5.1">much as expected that&amp;#39;s bad news for</text>

  <text start="608.59" dur="6.06">that&amp;#39;s Hertz Enterprise Avis and many</text>
  <text start="611.65" dur="4.65">others and when we look at this we can</text>
  <text start="614.65" dur="4.89">see this is going to be a complete</text>
  <text start="616.3" dur="6.69">disaster because we understand that</text>
  <text start="619.54" dur="5.79">there&amp;#39;s a lot of leases that are coming</text>

  <text start="650.65" dur="4.29">deteriorating actually in my area I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="652.81" dur="5.79">just seen three four houses go up for</text>
  <text start="654.94" dur="6.15">sale and I&amp;#39;ve seen houses for sale for</text>
  <text start="658.6" dur="4.86">almost six months now and no one is</text>
  <text start="661.09" dur="5.48">visiting them when I look around the</text>
  <text start="663.46" dur="5.85">country it is a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="666.57" dur="5.77">actually you as mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="669.31" dur="5.82">are continually falling now here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="672.34" dur="4.68">real twist here even though interest</text>
  <text start="675.13" dur="4.26">rates in the mortgage realm have come</text>
  <text start="677.02" dur="5.04">down a little bit even though the Fed is</text>
  <text start="679.39" dur="5.06">raising they&amp;#39;ve ticked down a little bit</text>
  <text start="682.06" dur="5.61">mortgage applications are still</text>
  <text start="684.45" dur="7">declining this is not a good sign</text>
  <text start="687.67" dur="6.72">because right now we are at a very low</text>
  <text start="691.45" dur="5.19">point for mortgage rates when these</text>
  <text start="694.39" dur="5.34">shoot up and they&amp;#39;re going to shoot up</text>
  <text start="696.64" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s going to be a disaster and the real</text>
  <text start="699.73" dur="4.53">estate market is gonna come crashing</text>
  <text start="701.59" dur="5.81">down now we know that Trump well he</text>
  <text start="704.26" dur="6.03">turned the tables on the Fed where</text>
  <text start="707.4" dur="6.37">during his campaign he said we need a</text>
  <text start="710.29" dur="4.38">very strong dollar and we need higher</text>
  <text start="713.77" dur="2.1">interest rates</text>
  <text start="714.67" dur="3.48">he said lower interest rate</text>
  <text start="715.87" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re a complete disaster and then he</text>
  <text start="718.15" dur="3.54">turned the tables on the Fed and said</text>
  <text start="719.47" dur="3.78">the actual opposite of this because we</text>
  <text start="721.69" dur="2.88">could see what&amp;#39;s happening right here we</text>
  <text start="723.25" dur="3.36">have the central bank in the deep state</text>
  <text start="724.57" dur="3.75">they want to collapse the economy blame</text>
  <text start="726.61" dur="4.2">it on Trump Trump is turning it around</text>
  <text start="728.32" dur="5.7">and he is making his move to blame it on</text>
  <text start="730.81" dur="5.46">them Trump understands that this economy</text>
  <text start="734.02" dur="4.5">can&amp;#39;t move forward any more he realizes</text>
  <text start="736.27" dur="4.14">that just with his cut with his</text>
  <text start="738.52" dur="4.92">corporations that there&amp;#39;s a certain</text>
  <text start="740.41" dur="6.15">point in time where the company where</text>
  <text start="743.44" dur="4.74">the country has to default no matter how</text>
  <text start="746.56" dur="4.14">much more credit you take on how much</text>
  <text start="748.18" dur="5.25">more money you borrow it makes no</text>
  <text start="750.7" dur="6.24">difference you need to wipe out the debt</text>
  <text start="753.43" dur="6.42">you need to start over and he realizes</text>
  <text start="756.94" dur="5.1">this right now he understands that this</text>
  <text start="759.85" dur="4.08">has to be this way he also understands</text>
  <text start="762.04" dur="3.96">that the central bank they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="763.93" dur="5.67">made their move so he&amp;#39;s making his move</text>
  <text start="766" dur="7.589">now a lot of people think minuchin well</text>
  <text start="769.6" dur="6.14">he&amp;#39;s part of trumps team and he picked</text>
  <text start="773.589" dur="6.061">them and he&amp;#39;s a goldman sachs player</text>
  <text start="775.74" dur="6.7">he&amp;#39;s not part of the team actually he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="779.65" dur="4.26">gonna be most likely someone that Trump</text>
  <text start="782.44" dur="3.69">is gonna get rid of but he needs him</text>
  <text start="783.91" dur="6.179">right now he needed to take him on</text>
  <text start="786.13" dur="6.329">now minuchin he is saying that no no</text>
  <text start="790.089" dur="4.051">Trump didn&amp;#39;t say that he wants the</text>
  <text start="792.459" dur="3.301">dollar to fall he wants the dollar to go</text>
  <text start="794.14" dur="5.04">up no Trump said he wants the dollar to</text>
  <text start="795.76" dur="6.66">fall and he&amp;#39;s trying to push his agenda</text>
  <text start="799.18" dur="6.63">for his certain crew and Trump has other</text>
  <text start="802.42" dur="5.609">plans all of this is smoke and mirrors</text>
  <text start="805.81" dur="3.45">and a game that is going on right now</text>
  <text start="808.029" dur="4.671">this is what everyone needs to</text>
  <text start="809.26" dur="6.63">understand everything is not like it was</text>
  <text start="812.7" dur="4.62">things have changed and we&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="815.89" dur="5.94">looking at all these different</text>
  <text start="817.32" dur="6.67">indicators to see how Trump reacts to</text>
  <text start="821.83" dur="4.59">all of us and it&amp;#39;s just not Trump there</text>
  <text start="823.99" dur="5.55">are individuals behind the scenes that</text>
  <text start="826.42" dur="5.49">are orchestrating all this to set up the</text>
  <text start="829.54" dur="5.4">deep state to get rid of the neocons to</text>
  <text start="831.91" dur="6.09">get rid of those individuals in Congress</text>
  <text start="834.94" dur="5.1">and that&amp;#39;s draining the swamp but you</text>
  <text start="838" dur="3.93">just can&amp;#39;t come out and do it I know at</text>
  <text start="840.04" dur="3.33">people like well you know you need to go</text>
  <text start="841.93" dur="2.88">in there and just say listen you&amp;#39;re gone</text>
  <text start="843.37" dur="3.39">you&amp;#39;re gone you&amp;#39;re gone let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="844.81" dur="4.29">rid of everyone it doesn&amp;#39;t work that way</text>
  <text start="846.76" dur="4.26">I mean we all wish it did</text>
  <text start="849.1" dur="3.69">but these factions have embedded</text>
  <text start="851.02" dur="4.47">themselves into government for such a</text>
  <text start="852.79" dur="6.24">long time that you need to play the game</text>
  <text start="855.49" dur="5.52">and outsmart these individuals and that</text>
  <text start="859.03" dur="5.64">is what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="861.01" dur="7.11">now Larry Fink CEO of Blackrock he is</text>
  <text start="864.67" dur="5.85">saying that the economy it looks like</text>
  <text start="868.12" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s in trouble he&amp;#39;s saying that we see</text>
  <text start="870.52" dur="5.1">some rather dark warnings about the US</text>
  <text start="873.31" dur="4.77">economy saying there are signs of</text>
  <text start="875.62" dur="3.81">slowing as business way whether the</text>
  <text start="878.08" dur="3.81">Trump administration will be able to</text>
  <text start="879.43" dur="5.13">pass tax reform and an infrastructure</text>
  <text start="881.89" dur="4.94">program quickly among other things being</text>
  <text start="884.56" dur="5.58">said the warning signs are getting</text>
  <text start="886.83" dur="5.92">darker and pointed to slowing auto sales</text>
  <text start="890.14" dur="4.98">corporate M&amp;amp;A activity as evidence that</text>
  <text start="892.75" dur="4.74">the underlying economy may not be as</text>
  <text start="895.12" dur="4.8">healthy as the S&amp;amp;P returns would</text>
  <text start="897.49" dur="5.19">indicate well of course it isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="899.92" dur="5.25">I mean we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all this we</text>
  <text start="902.68" dur="6.14">know that things are rapidly changing</text>
  <text start="905.17" dur="6.42">and Trump is not going to get the tax</text>
  <text start="908.82" dur="5.86">cuts he&amp;#39;s not going to be able to reform</text>
  <text start="911.59" dur="5.4">all this until after the collapse none</text>
  <text start="914.68" dur="5.25">of this is going to be done right now</text>
  <text start="916.99" dur="4.89">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing and just from</text>
  <text start="919.93" dur="5.07">the first quarter of GDP the estimates</text>
  <text start="921.88" dur="6.9">right now there at what point 5.6</text>
  <text start="925" dur="5.97">percent this is absolutely awful this is</text>
  <text start="928.78" dur="3.81">not a good reading we already see that</text>
  <text start="930.97" dur="4.32">there are companies still laying off</text>
  <text start="932.59" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;re not bringing back jobs all of</text>
  <text start="935.29" dur="6.69">this is being set for later right now</text>
  <text start="938.65" dur="6.21">you cannot do all of this the way it is</text>
  <text start="941.98" dur="4.86">just like a corporation who has so much</text>
  <text start="944.86" dur="3.27">debt you just can&amp;#39;t say you know what</text>
  <text start="946.84" dur="3.15">we&amp;#39;re gonna do we&amp;#39;re gonna add more</text>
  <text start="948.13" dur="6.57">people it doesn&amp;#39;t work that way you</text>
  <text start="949.99" dur="9.03">can&amp;#39;t do it it doesn&amp;#39;t work you need to</text>
  <text start="954.7" dur="7.74">reset you need to cancel out all of it</text>
  <text start="959.02" dur="4.86">and restart and this is what is being</text>
  <text start="962.44" dur="6.06">planned right now</text>
  <text start="963.88" dur="7.14">now Maduro out in Venezuela well almost</text>
  <text start="968.5" dur="5.91">2 years ago when Venezuela was</text>
  <text start="971.02" dur="5.79">cash-strapped he quietly conducted its</text>
  <text start="974.41" dur="5.55">first little known as gold for cash swap</text>
  <text start="976.81" dur="4.98">with C group and he traded in the</text>
  <text start="979.96" dur="2.43">nation&amp;#39;s gold reserves into at least 1</text>
  <text start="981.79" dur="4.41">billion</text>
  <text start="982.39" dur="7.8">cash courtesy of the US bank well he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="986.2" dur="7.41">back at it once again he&amp;#39;s in trouble he</text>
  <text start="990.19" dur="7.68">needs cash so what he&amp;#39;s about to do is</text>
  <text start="993.61" dur="8.31">he&amp;#39;s going to sell Venezuela seven point</text>
  <text start="997.87" dur="9.41">seven billion in gold reserves to get US</text>
  <text start="1001.92" dur="7.41">dollars and this gold that he&amp;#39;s selling</text>
  <text start="1007.28" dur="5.56">represents one of its most valuable</text>
  <text start="1009.33" dur="5.1">assets in the country now total foreign</text>
  <text start="1012.84" dur="3.84">reserves stood at around ten point three</text>
  <text start="1014.43" dur="3.81">billion on Monday near a fifteen year</text>
  <text start="1016.68" dur="3.6">low and if he sells the seven point</text>
  <text start="1018.24" dur="3.87">seven billion he&amp;#39;s really left with</text>
  <text start="1020.28" dur="5.73">hardly anything at this point and this</text>
  <text start="1022.11" dur="6.96">is exactly what the neocons the central</text>
  <text start="1026.01" dur="5.819">bank was trying to do they were trying</text>
  <text start="1029.07" dur="4.44">to make it so he can&amp;#39;t stay in power</text>
  <text start="1031.829" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to get rid of him</text>
  <text start="1033.51" dur="4.77">for a very long time why because they</text>
  <text start="1036.329" dur="4.981">understand that Venezuela has a lot of</text>
  <text start="1038.28" dur="5.88">oil just like the Middle East they want</text>
  <text start="1041.31" dur="6">the oil they want the oil on the dollar</text>
  <text start="1044.16" dur="6.27">and they are squeezing Venezuela right</text>
  <text start="1047.31" dur="4.35">now and we can see that Maduro is doing</text>
  <text start="1050.43" dur="4.23">whatever he possibly can to stay in</text>
  <text start="1051.66" dur="4.59">power but we can see right now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1054.66" dur="3.54">know how long this is going to last it</text>
  <text start="1056.25" dur="3.24">might last for a little bit while longer</text>
  <text start="1058.2" dur="3.87">but eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="1059.49" dur="5.58">he&amp;#39;ll have no gold to sell and they will</text>
  <text start="1062.07" dur="4.71">force him out but this might be a moot</text>
  <text start="1065.07" dur="4.02">point right now because we can see that</text>
  <text start="1066.78" dur="4.95">the world is going through a major</text>
  <text start="1069.09" dur="4.5">change where things are going to rapidly</text>

  <text start="1078.54" dur="3.96">is going to change completely this is</text>
  <text start="1080.94" dur="4.53">why you need to be prepared and ready</text>
  <text start="1082.5" dur="6.21">for what is about to happen and that is</text>
