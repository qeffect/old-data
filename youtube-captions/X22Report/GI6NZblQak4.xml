  <text start="128.39" dur="7.44">department stores where they were once</text>
  <text start="132.08" dur="7.5">the king of retail we are seeing that</text>
  <text start="135.83" dur="7.53">they are slowly dying they are not doing</text>
  <text start="139.58" dur="8.67">well and sales have been declining since</text>
  <text start="143.36" dur="7.47">2001 and it wasn&amp;#39;t entirely due to</text>
  <text start="148.25" dur="6.06">online shopping there are many other</text>
  <text start="150.83" dur="7.92">factors at work here and what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="154.31" dur="6">seeing is that sales and department</text>
  <text start="158.75" dur="6.36">stores sales and the brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="160.31" dur="7.86">stores well they&amp;#39;re all dying and then</text>
  <text start="165.11" dur="6.33">we look at online sales and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="168.17" dur="6.48">seeing here is that online sales yes</text>
  <text start="171.44" dur="6.99">they are receiving more sales but people</text>
  <text start="174.65" dur="6.52">are just moving to a different location</text>
  <text start="178.43" dur="5.44">of where they&amp;#39;re doing their retail</text>
  <text start="181.17" dur="5.22">purchases it&amp;#39;s not that they&amp;#39;re shopping</text>
  <text start="183.87" dur="4.91">in brick-and-mortar and also shopping</text>
  <text start="186.39" dur="5.19">online and spending a lot more money</text>
  <text start="188.78" dur="5.47">they&amp;#39;re just saying I&amp;#39;m gonna spend less</text>
  <text start="191.58" dur="7.02">here and just move it over to retail and</text>
  <text start="194.25" dur="6.209">look for better deals and I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="198.6" dur="3.81">to spend a lot more money those</text>
  <text start="200.459" dur="4.021">individuals who don&amp;#39;t have jobs well</text>
  <text start="202.41" dur="4.59">guess what they&amp;#39;re not spending more at</text>
  <text start="204.48" dur="6.539">all and when we look at general</text>
  <text start="207" dur="8.43">merchandise stores and online sales we</text>
  <text start="211.019" dur="11.011">see that it has been declining it has</text>
  <text start="215.43" dur="11.18">been declining since 2011 and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="222.03" dur="9.289">getting worse and worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="226.61" dur="9.58">so when we look at this and we see the</text>
  <text start="231.319" dur="7.151">combined sales of bricks and clicks we</text>
  <text start="236.19" dur="7.5">see there was an average of about 8.5%</text>
  <text start="238.47" dur="9.299">back in 2006 as of December 2016 it was</text>
  <text start="243.69" dur="6.54">less than half of that growth rate 4.2</text>
  <text start="247.769" dur="7.171">percent with sales in December below</text>
  <text start="250.23" dur="9.03">that average so consumers are not</text>
  <text start="254.94" dur="7.139">rushing to online to spend more money</text>
  <text start="259.26" dur="5.67">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="262.079" dur="6.421">away from brick-and-mortar and spending</text>
  <text start="264.93" dur="6.84">less online and they&amp;#39;re not shopping in</text>
  <text start="268.5" dur="8.039">brick-and-mortar as much we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="271.77" dur="7.74">seeing a huge surge of online sales</text>
  <text start="276.539" dur="6.081">where people are spending more this is</text>
  <text start="279.51" dur="9.24">why when you combine the two we see that</text>
  <text start="282.62" dur="8.98">sales in retail has been declining when</text>
  <text start="288.75" dur="5.22">we look at real estate we see that</text>
  <text start="291.6" dur="3.99">things are starting to deteriorate very</text>
  <text start="293.97" dur="3.39">very quickly there was a report that was</text>
  <text start="295.59" dur="5.28">released the elements fourth quarter</text>
  <text start="297.36" dur="6.2">2016 report and it looks like in New</text>
  <text start="300.87" dur="7.53">York and Manhattan real estate sales</text>
  <text start="303.56" dur="6.37">well it looks like they&amp;#39;re dropping the</text>
  <text start="308.4" dur="4.259">prices are dropping they&amp;#39;re down by</text>
  <text start="309.93" dur="4.83">eight point seven percent we see that</text>
  <text start="312.659" dur="5.251">sales are down</text>
  <text start="314.76" dur="6.2">and we also see listing days well</text>
  <text start="317.91" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re moving up they&amp;#39;re up 14% and</text>
  <text start="320.96" dur="5.83">these individuals who are trying to get</text>
  <text start="323.07" dur="8.16">rid of their very expensive luxury</text>
  <text start="326.79" dur="8.31">apartments luxury homes well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="331.23" dur="8.13">discounting those real estate properties</text>
  <text start="335.1" dur="7.2">by 5.5 percent and what that means is is</text>
  <text start="339.36" dur="5.79">that this bubble is popping right now</text>
  <text start="342.3" dur="5.16">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see it actually</text>
  <text start="345.15" dur="4.38">I&amp;#39;m seeing more and more homes on for</text>
  <text start="347.46" dur="4.61">sale and they&amp;#39;re staying on the market</text>
  <text start="349.53" dur="7.02">longer and longer they&amp;#39;re not moving</text>
  <text start="352.07" dur="6.4">now Obama decided to do one more face</text>
  <text start="356.55" dur="4.38">time it seems like he&amp;#39;s doing one more</text>
  <text start="358.47" dur="5.82">thing before he leaves office well he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="360.93" dur="8.78">done one more thing in regards to food</text>
  <text start="364.29" dur="7.29">stamps now we do have to remember since</text>
  <text start="369.71" dur="9.49">2008 when were in the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="371.58" dur="14.19">and this is 2017 now food stamps back</text>
  <text start="379.2" dur="9.15">then was around 25 million people back</text>
  <text start="385.77" dur="4.77">in 2008 now we&amp;#39;ve been through this</text>
  <text start="388.35" dur="3.71">incredible recovery where everyone is</text>
  <text start="390.54" dur="4.17">doing better everyone&amp;#39;s doing well</text>
  <text start="392.06" dur="5.59">unemployment is down to four point seven</text>
  <text start="394.71" dur="5.51">percent and what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is</text>
  <text start="397.65" dur="5.61">that those individuals on food stamps</text>
  <text start="400.22" dur="8.11">shot up to forty three point to two</text>
  <text start="403.26" dur="7.2">million so is this really a recovery all</text>
  <text start="408.33" dur="7.08">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is more people on</text>
  <text start="410.46" dur="8.85">food stamps almost double so what Obama</text>
  <text start="415.41" dur="7.44">decided to do he decided that he will</text>
  <text start="419.31" dur="6.24">allow food stamp recipients to take</text>
  <text start="422.85" dur="6">their taxpayer-funded benefit and order</text>
  <text start="425.55" dur="5.4">online from retailers like Amazon under</text>
  <text start="428.85" dur="4.74">a new Obama administration initiative</text>
  <text start="430.95" dur="4.56">that aims to facilitate the shopping</text>
  <text start="433.59" dur="5.46">experience for rural and urban residents</text>
  <text start="435.51" dur="5.7">to eliminate the welfare stigma the</text>
  <text start="439.05" dur="3.81">Obama administration renamed the food</text>
  <text start="441.21" dur="6.63">stamp Supplemental Nutrition Assistance</text>
  <text start="442.86" dur="5.699">Program and he&amp;#39;s making people feel more</text>
  <text start="447.84" dur="4.259">comfortable</text>
  <text start="448.559" dur="7.35">being on food stamps now if unemployment</text>
  <text start="452.099" dur="6.99">is so low why are there still so many</text>
  <text start="455.909" dur="7.65">people on food stamps it doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="459.089" dur="5.88">sense because back during 2007-2008 the</text>
  <text start="463.559" dur="3.66">unemployment was what four point two</text>
  <text start="464.969" dur="5.61">percent then moved up to four point six</text>
  <text start="467.219" dur="5.93">percent we&amp;#39;re at the same place so</text>
  <text start="470.579" dur="7.82">something is very wrong</text>
  <text start="473.149" dur="9.49">it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense but this is about</text>
  <text start="478.399" dur="6.58">trying to cover up how many people are</text>
  <text start="482.639" dur="4.2">on food stamps by renaming it by</text>
  <text start="484.979" dur="4.71">allowing them to shop online because</text>
  <text start="486.839" dur="6.3">they know that these numbers the</text>
  <text start="489.689" dur="4.71">unemployment the GDP retail sales the</text>
  <text start="493.139" dur="2.76">numbers the government is putting out</text>
  <text start="494.399" dur="4.55">there they&amp;#39;re completely fake phony and</text>
  <text start="495.899" dur="5.37">false and what is happening right now is</text>
  <text start="498.949" dur="4.78">they&amp;#39;re trying to make people feel</text>
  <text start="501.269" dur="5.55">comfortable in receiving welfare and</text>
  <text start="503.729" dur="4.44">with all of these programs that the</text>
  <text start="506.819" dur="5.88">government&amp;#39;s been talking about for</text>
  <text start="508.169" dur="7.98">decades we never go to the heart of the</text>
  <text start="512.699" dur="7.11">problem if you notice they keep talking</text>
  <text start="516.149" dur="6.66">about welfare food stamps health</text>
  <text start="519.809" dur="6.71">insurance the problems in the economy</text>
  <text start="522.809" dur="6.47">and if you realize what&amp;#39;s happening here</text>
  <text start="526.519" dur="6.281">none of these government officials ever</text>
  <text start="529.279" dur="5.771">ever ever go to the root of the problem</text>
  <text start="532.8" dur="6.839">and what is the problem it is the</text>
  <text start="535.05" dur="7.68">central bank the central bank has been</text>
  <text start="539.639" dur="6.75">creating this currency out of thin air</text>
  <text start="542.73" dur="6.75">and charging the people of the United</text>
  <text start="546.389" dur="6.51">States interest on this money which we</text>
  <text start="549.48" dur="6.029">have to pay back which D values the</text>
  <text start="552.899" dur="5.67">dollar as more and more of this currency</text>
  <text start="555.509" dur="5.491">is printed and the central bank which is</text>
  <text start="558.569" dur="4.86">a private corporation has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="561" dur="5.97">with the federal government they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="563.429" dur="6.33">it for their own profits they issued</text>
  <text start="566.97" dur="5.609">debt and they want profit they issued</text>
  <text start="569.759" dur="6.12">debt to countries and they want their</text>
  <text start="572.579" dur="7.471">hard assets they don&amp;#39;t care about the</text>
  <text start="575.879" dur="6.211">people they could care less about if the</text>
  <text start="580.05" dur="4.98">economy is growing</text>
  <text start="582.09" dur="8.19">if it&amp;#39;s doing well their agenda is to</text>
  <text start="585.03" dur="7.98">keep the economy working slightly just</text>
  <text start="590.28" dur="4.68">enough so people really don&amp;#39;t complain</text>
  <text start="593.01" dur="4.35">and what&amp;#39;s been happening to this point</text>
  <text start="594.96" dur="4.14">is that it&amp;#39;s been getting worse and</text>
  <text start="597.36" dur="5.43">worse and people are complaining right</text>
  <text start="599.1" dur="4.98">now and there&amp;#39;s all different types of</text>
  <text start="602.79" dur="3.45">problems with food stamps</text>
  <text start="604.08" dur="4.65">what we need to do is we need to go to</text>
  <text start="606.24" dur="4.44">the heart of the problem why do we have</text>
  <text start="608.73" dur="4.68">almost double the amount of people on</text>
  <text start="610.68" dur="5.76">food stamps why is the dollar devalued</text>
  <text start="613.41" dur="4.8">why are we at war why does the</text>
  <text start="616.44" dur="3.69">government keep the central bank why</text>
  <text start="618.21" dur="7.55">can&amp;#39;t they be audited why can&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="620.13" dur="9.63">ordered the gold reserves all of this is</text>
  <text start="625.76" dur="6.46">the root of the problem but nobody wants</text>
  <text start="629.76" dur="4.59">to look at this all they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="632.22" dur="5.4">looking at the side effects of the</text>
  <text start="634.35" dur="6.39">problem and trying to help the side</text>
  <text start="637.62" dur="6.6">effects it&amp;#39;s almost like a disease yes</text>
  <text start="640.74" dur="5.97">you can give cold medicine yes you can</text>
  <text start="644.22" dur="4.35">you know cover up if you&amp;#39;re cold but</text>
  <text start="646.71" dur="4.89">unless you go to the root of the problem</text>
  <text start="648.57" dur="5.04">what&amp;#39;s causing the disease well all</text>
  <text start="651.6" dur="3.09">you&amp;#39;re doing is masking all the symptoms</text>
  <text start="653.61" dur="3.39">and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ve been doing for</text>
  <text start="654.69" dur="5.28">years and years and years now the</text>
  <text start="657" dur="5.46">question is is the economy really back</text>
  <text start="659.97" dur="6.63">on track are we in this incredible</text>
  <text start="662.46" dur="8.07">recovery is retail and unemployment</text>
  <text start="666.6" dur="7.55">doing what they say well we can find out</text>
  <text start="670.53" dur="6.21">by Reap rail intermodal traffic</text>
  <text start="674.15" dur="4.93">this is long-haul movement of shipping</text>
  <text start="676.74" dur="6.93">containers and truck trailers by rail</text>
  <text start="679.08" dur="9.15">and when we look at this what do we see</text>

  <text start="697.71" dur="4.71">are being moved around the country which</text>
  <text start="699.54" dur="5.85">shows us our people purchasing it our</text>
  <text start="702.42" dur="7.23">stores stocking up on it and for the</text>
  <text start="705.39" dur="6.93">first time since 2009 yearly values are</text>

  <text start="712.32" dur="3.36">percentage terms the 2015-2016 decline</text>
  <text start="714.87" dur="4.889">is almost</text>
  <text start="715.68" dur="7.379">the same as the 2007-2008 decline when</text>
  <text start="719.759" dur="6.421">the financial crisis was raging which</text>
  <text start="723.059" dur="4.58">tells us we are back where we started</text>

  <text start="732.42" dur="3.839">getting worse</text>
  <text start="733.35" dur="7.95">because here we are in this incredible</text>

  <text start="741.3" dur="6.36">is declining this is an incredible</text>
  <text start="744.089" dur="4.92">indicator to show us how the economy is</text>
  <text start="747.66" dur="3.63">really doing because if people were</text>
  <text start="749.009" dur="5.07">purchasing and stores were stocking up</text>
  <text start="751.29" dur="6.299">and things were great truck traffic and</text>
  <text start="754.079" dur="6.721">rail traffic would be incredible but</text>
  <text start="757.589" dur="5.701">we&amp;#39;re not seeing that whatsoever which</text>
