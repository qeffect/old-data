  <text start="101.069" dur="5.511">it&amp;#39;s not just here in the United States</text>
  <text start="103.409" dur="6.151">we&amp;#39;re seeing it in many other countries</text>
  <text start="106.58" dur="5.379">Canada for instance the Canada Mortgage</text>
  <text start="109.56" dur="5.479">and Housing Cooperation well they issued</text>
  <text start="111.959" dur="6.47">a report warning that there is a strong</text>
  <text start="115.039" dur="6.731">evidence of overall problematic</text>
  <text start="118.429" dur="5.89">conditions what does that even mean well</text>
  <text start="121.77" dur="4.469">in the report the housing regulator</text>
  <text start="124.319" dur="4.231">again warns that while conditions in</text>
  <text start="126.239" dur="3.39">Canada&amp;#39;s housing market are showing some</text>
  <text start="128.55" dur="3.36">signs of improvement</text>
  <text start="129.629" dur="4.051">the official overall rating from the</text>
  <text start="131.91" dur="4.65">Canada Mortgage and Housing cooperation</text>
  <text start="133.68" dur="5.27">will be held at strong evidence of</text>
  <text start="136.56" dur="4.289">problematic conditions evidence of</text>
  <text start="138.95" dur="4.35">overvaluation has increased from</text>
  <text start="140.849" dur="4.711">moderate to strong in Victoria as</text>
  <text start="143.3" dur="4.78">fundamentals are not keeping up with</text>
  <text start="145.56" dur="4.61">higher prices there is also moderate</text>
  <text start="148.08" dur="4.829">evidence of price acceleration and</text>
  <text start="150.17" dur="5.5">overheating leading to strong overall</text>
  <text start="152.909" dur="5.671">evidence of these problems and it looks</text>
  <text start="155.67" dur="6.899">like what they&amp;#39;re saying is we are</text>
  <text start="158.58" dur="7.079">moving into a bubble territory and we</text>
  <text start="162.569" dur="6.151">are seeing bubbles pop up every place</text>
  <text start="165.659" dur="5.521">where things are overvalued overheated</text>
  <text start="168.72" dur="4.62">and these bubbles are getting to pop and</text>
  <text start="171.18" dur="5.97">what we&amp;#39;re seeing here in the United</text>
  <text start="173.34" dur="7.99">States is a housing echo bubble which</text>
  <text start="177.15" dur="6.37">exceeds the 2006 mm bubble peak</text>
  <text start="181.33" dur="4.41">and if you need some evidence that the</text>
  <text start="183.52" dur="4.89">echo bubble and housing is global we</text>
  <text start="185.74" dur="5.1">need to take a look at Sweden&amp;#39;s housing</text>
  <text start="188.41" dur="5.49">and a funny thing often occurs after</text>
  <text start="190.84" dur="5.39">many a fueled asset bubble pops an echo</text>
  <text start="193.9" dur="4.23">bubble inflates a few years later as</text>
  <text start="196.23" dur="3.76">monetary authorities and all the</text>
  <text start="198.13" dur="4.86">institutions that depend on rising asset</text>
  <text start="199.99" dur="5.94">valuations go all in to reflate the</text>
  <text start="202.99" dur="4.92">crushed asset classes and if we look at</text>
  <text start="205.93" dur="3.87">case-shiller home price index charge for</text>
  <text start="207.91" dur="5.16">San Francisco Seattle Portland Oregon</text>
  <text start="209.8" dur="6.75">each now exceeds its previous housing</text>
  <text start="213.07" dur="6.6">bubble the first go-around and here we</text>
  <text start="216.55" dur="5.7">are in the second go-around and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="219.67" dur="6.27">starting to see that it has topped that</text>
  <text start="222.25" dur="5.58">now housing bubbles take about five to</text>
  <text start="225.94" dur="5.16">six years to reach their bubble peaks</text>
  <text start="227.83" dur="6.21">and about half the time well to retrace</text>
  <text start="231.1" dur="5.52">much or all of its gains and when</text>
  <text start="234.04" dur="4.86">bubbles are followed by echo bubbles the</text>
  <text start="236.62" dur="5.13">bursting of the second bubble tends to</text>
  <text start="238.9" dur="5.46">signal the end of speculative cycle in</text>
  <text start="241.75" dur="5.22">that asset class there is no fundamental</text>
  <text start="244.36" dur="5.129">reason why housing could not round-trip</text>
  <text start="246.97" dur="6.3">two levels below the 2011 post bubble</text>
  <text start="249.489" dur="6.93">that we saw the first time now Fannie</text>
  <text start="253.27" dur="6.839">Mae well they just put the pedal to the</text>
  <text start="256.419" dur="6.301">metal and they just got their marching</text>
  <text start="260.109" dur="4.531">orders to spread more debt because</text>
  <text start="262.72" dur="5.52">remember the central banking system</text>
  <text start="264.64" dur="6.48">works by spreading debt inflating the</text>
  <text start="268.24" dur="3.48">bubbles blowing them up and we can see</text>
  <text start="271.12" dur="3.03">right now</text>
  <text start="271.72" dur="4.52">that Fannie Mae well they have</text>
  <text start="274.15" dur="5.46">introduced an innovative solution</text>
  <text start="276.24" dur="7.87">they&amp;#39;re allowing student loan student</text>
  <text start="279.61" dur="7.38">debt laden Millennials to buy a home how</text>
  <text start="284.11" dur="5.7">are they going to do this well they just</text>
  <text start="286.99" dur="5.34">change the rules allowing millennial</text>
  <text start="289.81" dur="6.66">bars among other things to simply</text>
  <text start="292.33" dur="7.41">exclude student loans credit cards and</text>
  <text start="296.47" dur="5.85">auto loans that are paid by someone else</text>
  <text start="299.74" dur="6.15">when they apply for a new mortgage and</text>
  <text start="302.32" dur="6.36">as an added benefit taxpayer subsidized</text>
  <text start="305.89" dur="6.149">mortgage loans can also now be used to</text>
  <text start="308.68" dur="6.13">repay student debt and this of course is</text>
  <text start="312.039" dur="5.981">going to work out great for everyone</text>
  <text start="314.81" dur="5.46">the taxpayers and this is a really good</text>
  <text start="318.02" dur="4.649">idea for the Millennials who are already</text>
  <text start="320.27" dur="4.89">suffering the financial consequences of</text>
  <text start="322.669" dur="6.301">having too much debt who really can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="325.16" dur="6.15">find work or anything like that and this</text>
  <text start="328.97" dur="5.61">is all about inflating the housing</text>
  <text start="331.31" dur="6.87">bubble once again and we can see right</text>
  <text start="334.58" dur="5.64">now there is a race on right now on who</text>
  <text start="338.18" dur="5.31">is going to bring the economy down first</text>
  <text start="340.22" dur="5.55">and who it&amp;#39;s going to be blamed on now</text>
  <text start="343.49" dur="4.23">the central bankers they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="345.77" dur="3.54">started the process of bringing down the</text>
  <text start="347.72" dur="4.259">economy they started raising the</text>
  <text start="349.31" dur="5.19">interest rates and they&amp;#39;re inflating the</text>
  <text start="351.979" dur="4.671">bubbles and they&amp;#39;re trying to bring this</text>
  <text start="354.5" dur="6.06">down now they want to control this</text>
  <text start="356.65" dur="6.16">entire system coming down why because if</text>
  <text start="360.56" dur="5.04">they can control it they can blame</text>
  <text start="362.81" dur="6.21">whoever they want they have the ability</text>
  <text start="365.6" dur="7.23">to control the narrative of how this</text>
  <text start="369.02" dur="6.6">happened they can control on how they</text>
  <text start="372.83" dur="4.5">want to proceed going forward by maybe</text>
  <text start="375.62" dur="3.45">lowering the interest rates going</text>
  <text start="377.33" dur="5.64">negative interest rates now because</text>
  <text start="379.07" dur="6.9">we&amp;#39;re in trouble creating more currency</text>
  <text start="382.97" dur="5.64">and basically to have the control to</text>
  <text start="385.97" dur="4.53">start the system over again to say that</text>
  <text start="388.61" dur="5.34">this is why you need the central bank</text>
  <text start="390.5" dur="5.43">now we have on the other hand via trump</text>
  <text start="393.95" dur="3.24">administration those individuals who are</text>
  <text start="395.93" dur="2.64">behind the scenes saying you know</text>
  <text start="397.19" dur="3.15">something we need to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="398.57" dur="4.56">central bank we need to take charge</text>
  <text start="400.34" dur="5.67">right now where they are blowing up the</text>
  <text start="403.13" dur="4.59">bubble and trying to pop it before the</text>
  <text start="406.01" dur="4.02">central bank this way</text>
  <text start="407.72" dur="4.19">they can call the central bank out on it</text>
  <text start="410.03" dur="5.04">and everything that Trump is doing is</text>
  <text start="411.91" dur="5.14">moving in that direction he&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="415.07" dur="4.409">to be bringing back jobs he&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="417.05" dur="4.2">to make the economy better but every act</text>
  <text start="419.479" dur="3.931">that he does now which is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="421.25" dur="4.2">watching these are the indicators I mean</text>
  <text start="423.41" dur="3.66">if he strays from this we know something</text>
  <text start="425.45" dur="3.9">else has changed something else is going</text>
  <text start="427.07" dur="4.98">on but everything that he does now is</text>
  <text start="429.35" dur="5.129">going to be completely different than</text>
  <text start="432.05" dur="6.56">what you thought was going to happen</text>
  <text start="434.479" dur="6.891">because what he&amp;#39;s doing is he is</text>
  <text start="438.61" dur="6.489">basically working undercover just like a</text>
  <text start="441.37" dur="6.01">drug agent or FBI detective who goes</text>
  <text start="445.099" dur="3.421">undercover into some type of criminal</text>
  <text start="447.38" dur="3.599">ring</text>
  <text start="448.52" dur="5.369">tens there one of them works with them</text>
  <text start="450.979" dur="6">gets them to trust what he is doing or</text>
  <text start="453.889" dur="6.12">she is doing and then comes after them</text>
  <text start="456.979" dur="5.16">this is exactly what Trump is doing and</text>
  <text start="460.009" dur="5.25">this is why it looks so strange to</text>
  <text start="462.139" dur="6.511">everyone because in the beginning he did</text>
  <text start="465.259" dur="4.56">try this other method where he came out</text>
  <text start="468.65" dur="3.329">and said okay we&amp;#39;re gonna bring back</text>
  <text start="469.819" dur="5.19">jobs we&amp;#39;re gonna change this and guess</text>
  <text start="471.979" dur="5.731">what it did work you can&amp;#39;t do it so you</text>
  <text start="475.009" dur="5.491">need to go undercover you need to work</text>
  <text start="477.71" dur="5.85">in this way but there are certain little</text>
  <text start="480.5" dur="5.28">hints to show us that he&amp;#39;s still trying</text>
  <text start="483.56" dur="5.099">to do what he said he was going to do</text>
  <text start="485.78" dur="5.609">and he&amp;#39;s preparing this for when this</text>
  <text start="488.659" dur="5.431">whole system comes down where these</text>
  <text start="491.389" dur="4.321">individuals can gain control of the</text>
  <text start="494.09" dur="5.19">system and get rid of the central bank</text>
  <text start="495.71" dur="5.959">now the Trump administration well they</text>
  <text start="499.28" dur="5.069">are preparing an executive order on</text>
  <text start="501.669" dur="4.8">withdrawing the u.s. from NAFTA now the</text>
  <text start="504.349" dur="4.861">deep state wanted NAFTA this just not</text>
  <text start="506.469" dur="5.2">NAFTA did not help the job situation</text>
  <text start="509.21" dur="5.069">whatsoever actually it removed the jobs</text>
  <text start="511.669" dur="4.591">from the United States and we can see</text>
  <text start="514.279" dur="3.781">there&amp;#39;s a draft order it has been</text>
  <text start="516.26" dur="4.5">submitted for the final stages of review</text>
  <text start="518.06" dur="6.06">and it most likely will be unveiled</text>
  <text start="520.76" dur="4.92">maybe in the next coming weeks so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="524.12" dur="4.62">something that we need to look at and</text>
  <text start="525.68" dur="4.95">watch Trump has come out with his tax</text>
  <text start="528.74" dur="4.65">reform plan we know this is not going to</text>
  <text start="530.63" dur="6">pass whatsoever but he came out with it</text>
  <text start="533.39" dur="5.31">to show that yes he&amp;#39;s looking at cutting</text>
  <text start="536.63" dur="4.079">taxes right now and we know the deep</text>
  <text start="538.7" dur="4.32">state the central bankers they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="540.709" dur="4.891">want any of this this is not going to</text>
  <text start="543.02" dur="5.069">help their situation and we can see</text>
  <text start="545.6" dur="5.299">right now that the bubbles are growing</text>
  <text start="548.089" dur="6">right now the US stock market is</text>
  <text start="550.899" dur="6.401">officially in a massive bubble based on</text>
  <text start="554.089" dur="6.511">the one valuation metric that cannot be</text>
  <text start="557.3" dur="5.94">faked corporations while they can engage</text>
  <text start="560.6" dur="6.02">in any number of accounting gimmicks to</text>
  <text start="563.24" dur="5.909">juice their earnings cash flow dividends</text>
  <text start="566.62" dur="5.83">buybacks they can do all this kind of</text>
  <text start="569.149" dur="6.901">stuff for this reason the PE the P CF</text>
  <text start="572.45" dur="6.47">and the P dy ratios are all suspect when</text>
  <text start="576.05" dur="6.39">it comes time to value a corporation</text>
  <text start="578.92" dur="6.82">sales well that&amp;#39;s a little bit</text>
  <text start="582.44" dur="4.71">order to manipulate yeah I guess you can</text>
  <text start="585.74" dur="3.42">go into the books and just say we made</text>
  <text start="587.15" dur="5.19">this number of sales but it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="589.16" dur="5.52">be pretty darn obvious when you do this</text>
  <text start="592.34" dur="5.25">so it&amp;#39;s very difficult to do either</text>
  <text start="594.68" dur="5.04">money comes in the door or it really</text>
  <text start="597.59" dur="3.78">doesn&amp;#39;t and if a company is caught</text>
  <text start="599.72" dur="4.83">messing around with sales numbers</text>
  <text start="601.37" dur="6.36">well someone sometimes goes to jail for</text>
  <text start="604.55" dur="6.21">this reason price to sales is perhaps</text>
  <text start="607.73" dur="6.66">the single most objective and clear</text>
  <text start="610.76" dur="7.02">means of measuring stock valuations now</text>
  <text start="614.39" dur="5.16">this metric above all others you can</text>
  <text start="617.78" dur="4.77">point to and say this is definitely</text>
  <text start="619.55" dur="5.97">accurate and has not been messed with on</text>
  <text start="622.55" dur="7.65">that note as bill King recently noted</text>
  <text start="625.52" dur="7.83">today the S&amp;amp;P 500 is sporting a price to</text>
  <text start="630.2" dur="6.84">sales ratio that is massively higher</text>
  <text start="633.35" dur="6.06">than it was in 2007 and is only</text>
  <text start="637.04" dur="5.46">marginally lower than it was during the</text>
  <text start="639.41" dur="6.29">tech bubble the single largest stock</text>
  <text start="642.5" dur="7.74">bubble of all time for most measures and</text>
  <text start="645.7" dur="7.75">here we are today there is simply no way</text>
  <text start="650.24" dur="6.05">to look at this and not call it a bubble</text>
  <text start="653.45" dur="5.28">it is well above the 2000 bubble and</text>
  <text start="656.29" dur="4.45">just slightly smaller than the tech</text>
  <text start="658.73" dur="5.16">bubble this bubble like all other</text>
  <text start="660.74" dur="5.61">bubbles will burst we know it will it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="663.89" dur="5.19">a fact it has done it throughout history</text>
  <text start="666.35" dur="4.77">and we can see that the central bank</text>
  <text start="669.08" dur="4.83">throughout time well they pumped the</text>
  <text start="671.12" dur="4.59">market up they sell it off the retail</text>
  <text start="673.91" dur="4.5">investors come in the speculators come</text>
  <text start="675.71" dur="4.74">in and they bring the system down this</text>
  <text start="678.41" dur="4.68">is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now but this</text>
  <text start="680.45" dur="5.37">time well it&amp;#39;s a little different</text>
  <text start="683.09" dur="5.79">because the central bank realizes that</text>
  <text start="685.82" dur="7.019">they need to bring this down and this</text>
  <text start="688.88" dur="7.2">time the entire system is coming down</text>
  <text start="692.839" dur="5.25">and it&amp;#39;s a race of who&amp;#39;s going to win</text>
  <text start="696.08" dur="5.1">and who is going to control the</text>
  <text start="698.089" dur="5.551">narrative of the story now we know that</text>
  <text start="701.18" dur="3.81">Trump said he&amp;#39;s stepping back on the</text>
  <text start="703.64" dur="3.6">budget for the wall and we know the</text>
  <text start="704.99" dur="3.81">budget of the wall is so tiny and</text>
  <text start="707.24" dur="5.18">miniscule compared to everything else</text>
  <text start="708.8" dur="7.44">that the house has to sit here and</text>
  <text start="712.42" dur="7.359">extend the I guess the</text>
  <text start="716.24" dur="6.81">the negotiations for a week to give them</text>
  <text start="719.779" dur="5.911">some time because they can&amp;#39;t do this you</text>
  <text start="723.05" dur="3.57">know in in the time period that they</text>
  <text start="725.69" dur="2.76">have right now</text>
  <text start="726.62" dur="4.589">now of course they&amp;#39;re going to pass it</text>
  <text start="728.45" dur="4.8">everything is going to go forward they</text>
  <text start="731.209" dur="4.201">might shut down for a little bit but we</text>
  <text start="733.25" dur="4.92">can see right now they want the free</text>
  <text start="735.41" dur="6.09">money coming in they want all of it to</text>
  <text start="738.17" dur="6.12">happen and Trump wants it to happen they</text>
  <text start="741.5" dur="5.85">he wants Congress to do this he wants</text>
  <text start="744.29" dur="5.73">them to pass this he wants the bubbles</text>
  <text start="747.35" dur="5.01">to pop now Rand Paul said something very</text>
  <text start="750.02" dur="5.25">interesting if you want to drain the</text>
  <text start="752.36" dur="4.8">swamp you have to take away money from</text>
  <text start="755.27" dur="3.74">Washington and send it back to the</text>
  <text start="757.16" dur="4.89">people now this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="759.01" dur="4.84">because how do you do this well with the</text>
  <text start="762.05" dur="3.63">way the system is today can you just say</text>
  <text start="763.85" dur="3.9">ok you know what we&amp;#39;re going to have a</text>
  <text start="765.68" dur="4.11">budget we&amp;#39;re going to slash programs and</text>
  <text start="767.75" dur="3.87">you know everything is going to be fine</text>
  <text start="769.79" dur="4.89">and we don&amp;#39;t have to worry about it well</text>
  <text start="771.62" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s not going to work because first of</text>
  <text start="774.68" dur="3.63">all Congress who&amp;#39;s still controlled by</text>
  <text start="776.57" dur="3.09">the central bank and corporations</text>
  <text start="778.31" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re not going to let it happen</text>
  <text start="779.66" dur="4.59">because we know they&amp;#39;re not working for</text>
  <text start="781.7" dur="5.329">the people so what do you have to do you</text>
  <text start="784.25" dur="6.18">have to take the money away from</text>
  <text start="787.029" dur="5.351">Congress how do you do that you get rid</text>
  <text start="790.43" dur="4.349">of the central bank what&amp;#39;s the purpose</text>
  <text start="792.38" dur="4.709">of the central bank there is no purpose</text>
  <text start="794.779" dur="5.191">to the central bank what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="797.089" dur="4.62">managing the economy of the United</text>
  <text start="799.97" dur="4.59">States they&amp;#39;re not even part of the</text>
  <text start="801.709" dur="5.101">government their mandate is not to</text>
  <text start="804.56" dur="6.18">support the people and help the people</text>
  <text start="806.81" dur="6.96">and help the country their mandate is to</text>
  <text start="810.74" dur="5.13">themselves to profit to spreading debt</text>
  <text start="813.77" dur="5.46">and all they were supposed to do was</text>
  <text start="815.87" dur="7.29">create currency out of thin air there is</text>
  <text start="819.23" dur="7.02">absolutely no reason for the central</text>
  <text start="823.16" dur="4.98">bank and the only reason it&amp;#39;s around and</text>
  <text start="826.25" dur="3.93">the only reason why it&amp;#39;s not audited</text>
  <text start="828.14" dur="3.72">because the central bank has free money</text>
  <text start="830.18" dur="4.02">what can you do with money that is</text>
  <text start="831.86" dur="5.37">created out of thin air you can pass it</text>
  <text start="834.2" dur="5.699">along to those in government you can</text>
  <text start="837.23" dur="5.849">pass it along to banks you can pass it</text>
  <text start="839.899" dur="6.331">along to corporations and they all do</text>
  <text start="843.079" dur="6.031">what you want and once all these people</text>
  <text start="846.23" dur="3.6">are bought and paid for it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="849.11" dur="2.94">difficult</text>
  <text start="849.83" dur="4.65">for them to do anything else but to do</text>
  <text start="852.05" dur="5.52">what the central bank wants and this is</text>
  <text start="854.48" dur="5.76">why you see that Congress it really</text>
  <text start="857.57" dur="5.28">doesn&amp;#39;t work for the people now during</text>
  <text start="860.24" dur="6.81">this whole time we see China we see</text>
  <text start="862.85" dur="6.75">Russia we see India they are adding more</text>
  <text start="867.05" dur="5.19">and more gold actually China&amp;#39;s net gold</text>
  <text start="869.6" dur="4.859">imports via Hong Kong more than doubled</text>
  <text start="872.24" dur="4.62">in march to a hundred and eleven point</text>
  <text start="874.459" dur="5.461">six tons Russia is doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="876.86" dur="6.419">because they realize that the dollar</text>
  <text start="879.92" dur="6.9">will not exist any more when this system</text>
  <text start="883.279" dur="5.761">comes down that&amp;#39;s it the whole thing has</text>
  <text start="886.82" dur="5.19">to be restarted the central bank will</text>
  <text start="889.04" dur="4.47">not exist and there&amp;#39;ll be a new currency</text>
  <text start="892.01" dur="3.69">what it will be we don&amp;#39;t know right now</text>
  <text start="893.51" dur="4.62">will it be backed by gold well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="895.7" dur="4.65">starting to look like that or gold might</text>
  <text start="898.13" dur="3.99">play some type of role in this because</text>
  <text start="900.35" dur="4.47">we can see that Russia and China</text>
  <text start="902.12" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;ve been accumulating as much as</text>
  <text start="904.82" dur="3.99">they possibly can and something else</text>
  <text start="906.74" dur="5.46">very interesting everytime United States</text>
  <text start="908.81" dur="5.46">the central bankers have gone into any</text>
  <text start="912.2" dur="3.87">of the countries Libya Yemen you know</text>
  <text start="914.27" dur="4.259">the first thing they do is they take the</text>
  <text start="916.07" dur="4.709">gold very interesting because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="918.529" dur="5.011">been telling us that gold is a barbaric</text>
  <text start="920.779" dur="4.68">you know relic and it&amp;#39;s really not worth</text>
  <text start="923.54" dur="3.69">anything why do they always take the</text>
  <text start="925.459" dur="4.801">gold as soon as they get into these</text>
  <text start="927.23" dur="6.21">countries because they know that is the</text>
  <text start="930.26" dur="4.74">real wealth this paper and ink that they</text>
  <text start="933.44" dur="2.94">create which is not paper and ink</text>
  <text start="935" dur="3.209">anymore they&amp;#39;re just putting you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="936.38" dur="4.11">pushing a button on a computer but</text>
  <text start="938.209" dur="3.961">something they create a thin air this is</text>
  <text start="940.49" dur="4.5">worthless this is why they always try to</text>
  <text start="942.17" dur="4.71">trade it in for real hard assets this is</text>
  <text start="944.99" dur="4.89">why they put countries into debt and</text>
  <text start="946.88" dur="5.22">they go in and they steal their assets</text>
  <text start="949.88" dur="3.72">for pennies on the dollar because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="952.1" dur="4.92">what they really want</text>
  <text start="953.6" dur="6.63">they don&amp;#39;t want paper and ink they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="957.02" dur="8.12">already creating that they want the hard</text>
  <text start="960.23" dur="8.52">assets gold silver they want land ports</text>
  <text start="965.14" dur="7.509">buildings you name it they want that</text>
  <text start="968.75" dur="6.39">that is the real wealth so where are we</text>
  <text start="972.649" dur="4.141">headed right now well there&amp;#39;s a race</text>
  <text start="975.14" dur="5.25">right now on right now</text>
  <text start="976.79" dur="5.64">to crash the system and the winner will</text>

  <text start="982.43" dur="5.37">story the</text>
  <text start="983.57" dur="6.33">winner will reset the system now we are</text>
  <text start="987.8" dur="3.93">hoping that it&amp;#39;s not the central bank</text>
  <text start="989.9" dur="3.63">because if it is the central bank guess</text>

  <text start="993.53" dur="4.86">central bank they&amp;#39;re going to start this</text>
  <text start="995.48" dur="4.41">nightmare all over again if it&amp;#39;s Trump</text>
