  <text start="81.56" dur="5.309">their press release on how much people</text>
  <text start="84.47" dur="3.63">have spent over this holiday season</text>
  <text start="86.869" dur="3.631">we&amp;#39;re gonna get into that in just a</text>
  <text start="88.1" dur="6.03">moment but what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="90.5" dur="7.38">that consumer confidence pretty much</text>
  <text start="94.13" dur="7.379">stumbles as hope plunges and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="97.88" dur="5.7">seeing is there&amp;#39;s a huge spread now the</text>
  <text start="101.509" dur="4.381">spread that we&amp;#39;re seeing this is the</text>
  <text start="103.58" dur="5.97">widest spread between current and future</text>
  <text start="105.89" dur="7.44">expectations in history and every time</text>
  <text start="109.55" dur="8.28">we&amp;#39;ve seen this type of spread what has</text>
  <text start="113.33" dur="6.659">happened well if we go back to 2008 we</text>
  <text start="117.83" dur="6.269">saw the same thing where the current and</text>
  <text start="119.989" dur="7.591">future expectations there is a huge</text>
  <text start="124.099" dur="6.811">spread and basically we entered a</text>
  <text start="127.58" dur="4.769">recession if we go back to 2001 we see</text>
  <text start="130.91" dur="3.659">the same thing if we go back in time</text>
  <text start="132.349" dur="5.72">it&amp;#39;s pretty much the same thing and here</text>
  <text start="134.569" dur="6.42">we are once again with that same exact</text>
  <text start="138.069" dur="6.241">spread and this is just another</text>
  <text start="140.989" dur="6.991">indicator letting us know that something</text>
  <text start="144.31" dur="5.38">isn&amp;#39;t right now we know the retail</text>
  <text start="147.98" dur="4.259">industry they&amp;#39;ve been struggling a lot</text>
  <text start="149.69" dur="3.96">of stores are closing and the corporate</text>
  <text start="152.239" dur="3.571">media is out there telling us that this</text>
  <text start="153.65" dur="3.479">is a one of the best holiday seasons</text>
  <text start="155.81" dur="3.03">that we&amp;#39;ve seen in a long time in</text>
  <text start="157.129" dur="3.69">MasterCard they released their press</text>
  <text start="158.84" dur="5.27">release with some data on how much</text>
  <text start="160.819" dur="6.931">remember debt people have used to</text>
  <text start="164.11" dur="6.04">purchase items now this press release</text>
  <text start="167.75" dur="5.37">came from MasterCard spending plus and</text>
  <text start="170.15" dur="6.059">it reported the holiday shopping and it</text>
  <text start="173.12" dur="7.589">it didn&amp;#39;t include automotive and it</text>
  <text start="176.209" dur="6.391">didn&amp;#39;t include gasoline sales so from</text>
  <text start="180.709" dur="5.281">November 1st through December 24th</text>
  <text start="182.6" dur="5.73">across all payment types cash check</text>
  <text start="185.99" dur="5.61">everything else we see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="188.33" dur="5.55">saying that retail is or spending I</text>
  <text start="191.6" dur="4.86">should say rose to four point nine</text>
  <text start="193.88" dur="5.64">percent from the same period a year ago</text>
  <text start="196.46" dur="4.89">now it makes it seem like it moved up</text>
  <text start="199.52" dur="4.5">another four point nine percent and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="201.35" dur="7.86">doing great that&amp;#39;s not what happened if</text>
  <text start="204.02" dur="8.28">you go back a year ago 2016 the spending</text>
  <text start="209.21" dur="5.61">at that time was four percent so we went</text>
  <text start="212.3" dur="4.71">up point nine percent that part is a</text>
  <text start="214.82" dur="6.81">little misleading now remember we were</text>
  <text start="217.01" dur="6.21">at four point nine percent and store I</text>
  <text start="221.63" dur="4.59">mean a four percent back in twenty</text>
  <text start="223.22" dur="4.68">sixteen and stores were closing they</text>
  <text start="226.22" dur="4.23">couldn&amp;#39;t make it here we are at four</text>
  <text start="227.9" dur="6.45">point nine percent and again this is</text>
  <text start="230.45" dur="8.67">what people spent using debt this is not</text>
  <text start="234.35" dur="6.18">the profits of the stores these are two</text>
  <text start="239.12" dur="4.05">different things because what&amp;#39;s included</text>
  <text start="240.53" dur="4.35">in this is people going out to dinner</text>
  <text start="243.17" dur="4.86">people buying a lot of food for the</text>
  <text start="244.88" dur="4.86">holidays Thanksgiving Christmas and</text>
  <text start="248.03" dur="5.76">everything else this is everyday</text>
  <text start="249.74" dur="5.64">shopping this is not just one thing so</text>
  <text start="253.79" dur="3.27">this is a lot of different things all</text>
  <text start="255.38" dur="3.06">wrapped up to one and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="257.06" dur="1.799">use their credit cards to pay their</text>
  <text start="258.44" dur="3">bills</text>
  <text start="258.859" dur="7.441">so we need to look at this very very</text>
  <text start="261.44" dur="8.19">carefully and if we go back to 2016 like</text>
  <text start="266.3" dur="5.55">I said retail sales grew at four percent</text>
  <text start="269.63" dur="4.08">in 2016 this is coming from the same</text>
  <text start="271.85" dur="4.68">type of press release that Marsten</text>
  <text start="273.71" dur="6.3">MasterCard spending pulse puts out there</text>
  <text start="276.53" dur="5.93">if we go back to 2015 they released the</text>
  <text start="280.01" dur="9.24">same numbers and it was 7.9 percent in</text>
  <text start="282.46" dur="8.65">2015 in 2014 it was 5.5 percent so we</text>
  <text start="289.25" dur="3.3">went from 5.5 percent and all of a</text>
  <text start="291.11" dur="3.6">sudden we went the 7.9 percent which</text>
  <text start="292.55" dur="5.25">again which means nothing this is just</text>
  <text start="294.71" dur="5.15">debt and then all of a sudden dropped to</text>
  <text start="297.8" dur="4.68">four and we&amp;#39;re four point nine percent</text>
  <text start="299.86" dur="4.24">so we&amp;#39;re have we really gone is this</text>
  <text start="302.48" dur="3.63">really that great of a holiday season</text>
  <text start="304.1" dur="3.45">because we&amp;#39;re hovering around that four</text>
  <text start="306.11" dur="6.3">percent now let&amp;#39;s go a little bit</text>
  <text start="307.55" dur="6.72">further here online sales went up to 18</text>
  <text start="312.41" dur="3.96">percent year-over-year now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="314.27" dur="5.1">making it seem like oh my god is that 18</text>
  <text start="316.37" dur="3.57">percent but it was at 15.6 percent last</text>
  <text start="319.37" dur="3.48">year</text>
  <text start="319.94" dur="5.76">so it wasn&amp;#39;t like it doubled it tripled</text>
  <text start="322.85" dur="4.56">or anything like that more people</text>
  <text start="325.7" dur="3.3">decided I&amp;#39;m gonna sit at home and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="327.41" dur="4.71">gonna order online no this is not all</text>
  <text start="329" dur="4.92">Amazon so we need to look at this data</text>
  <text start="332.12" dur="3.57">and we need to say well wait a minute</text>
  <text start="333.92" dur="4.41">what are they really doing here what</text>
  <text start="335.69" dur="7.62">really makes sense now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="338.33" dur="6.84">interesting is that if you remove the</text>
  <text start="343.31" dur="6.24">gasoline sales from their number four</text>
  <text start="345.17" dur="8.76">point nine percent sales went up by four</text>
  <text start="349.55" dur="9.51">point two percent is it as great as</text>
  <text start="353.93" dur="8.4">they&amp;#39;re saying right now no it&amp;#39;s not so</text>
  <text start="359.06" dur="4.83">what is happening here is they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="362.33" dur="4.65">four point nine percent to make everyone</text>
  <text start="363.89" dur="4.89">believe that sales increased by four</text>
  <text start="366.98" dur="5.94">point nine percent sales didn&amp;#39;t increase</text>
  <text start="368.78" dur="5.7">debt increased we don&amp;#39;t know what the</text>
  <text start="372.92" dur="4.59">holiday season is going to look like</text>
  <text start="374.48" dur="5.43">until the retailer&amp;#39;s publish their</text>
  <text start="377.51" dur="3.12">numbers and what profit and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="379.91" dur="4.56">bottom line</text>
  <text start="380.63" dur="5.31">what&amp;#39;s their revenue because yeah this</text>
  <text start="384.47" dur="3.03">is a great number four point nine</text>
  <text start="385.94" dur="3.21">percent we&amp;#39;re really isn&amp;#39;t but four</text>
  <text start="387.5" dur="3.6">point nine percent but if they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="389.15" dur="6.03">make any profit they&amp;#39;re gonna be closing</text>
  <text start="391.1" dur="7.34">down and if we look at this we could see</text>
  <text start="395.18" dur="7.77">that there&amp;#39;s major problems here now</text>
  <text start="398.44" dur="7">coming out of op toro they look at the</text>
  <text start="402.95" dur="4.41">holiday season they say okay we see the</text>
  <text start="405.44" dur="5.28">holiday season and we&amp;#39;re going to give</text>
  <text start="407.36" dur="5.22">you an estimate of the returns they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="410.72" dur="4.5">saying that consumers are going to be</text>
  <text start="412.58" dur="5.4">going to be returning about forty-five</text>
  <text start="415.22" dur="6">percent of their purchases and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="417.98" dur="6.24">gonna be about ninety billion worth of</text>
  <text start="421.22" dur="5.37">goods so we&amp;#39;re gonna have to subtract</text>
  <text start="424.22" dur="6.18">that number when the returns start</text>
  <text start="426.59" dur="5.93">coming in and most of the returns guess</text>
  <text start="430.4" dur="4.38">what they end up with and landfills a</text>
  <text start="432.52" dur="3.61">lot of it they don&amp;#39;t even restock on the</text>
  <text start="434.78" dur="3.45">shelves they go back to the</text>
  <text start="436.13" dur="4.8">manufacturers it might be damaged</text>
  <text start="438.23" dur="4.77">something else might be wrong and we can</text>
  <text start="440.93" dur="4.35">see right now this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="443" dur="4.89">problem now UPS is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="445.28" dur="7.5">saying that they&amp;#39;re looking at a huge</text>
  <text start="447.89" dur="5.97">return extravaganza in January of 2018</text>
  <text start="452.78" dur="4.86">they said listen</text>
  <text start="453.86" dur="6.87">last January 2017 5.8 million packages</text>
  <text start="457.64" dur="5.85">were returned to retailers and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="460.73" dur="5.88">saying that in January they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="463.49" dur="5.46">probably beat that number now when we</text>
  <text start="466.61" dur="4.34">look at all this and even when we go</text>
  <text start="468.95" dur="6.3">towards restaurants we can see that</text>
  <text start="470.95" dur="7.48">restaurant sales they are down now look</text>
  <text start="475.25" dur="7.14">at these numbers they were at 5.6</text>
  <text start="478.43" dur="5.99">percent in 2016 they are on pace and</text>
  <text start="482.39" dur="6.72">we&amp;#39;re almost at the end of this year for</text>
  <text start="484.42" dur="9.34">3.2 percent that&amp;#39;s how far restaurant</text>
  <text start="489.11" dur="8.28">sales are down which tells you we are in</text>
  <text start="493.76" dur="6.56">a whole heap of trouble now remember a</text>
  <text start="497.39" dur="6.36">lot of these purchases they are done on</text>
  <text start="500.32" dur="5.08">debt and we can take a look at these</text>
  <text start="503.75" dur="3.87">debt levels because the Urban Institute</text>
  <text start="505.4" dur="4.56">was able to release figures on debt</text>
  <text start="507.62" dur="4.71">levels across America and when we look</text>
  <text start="509.96" dur="3.69">at the states we can see that Wow a lot</text>
  <text start="512.33" dur="3.3">of these states the people that live in</text>
  <text start="513.65" dur="6.95">these states there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="515.63" dur="8.22">debt and we see right now statisti</text>
  <text start="520.6" dur="5.62">reports nationwide 33 percent of people</text>
  <text start="523.85" dur="4.46">have debt that has gone into collections</text>
  <text start="526.22" dur="5.01">which means they have unpaid billed</text>
  <text start="528.31" dur="6.04">creditors have either closed or trying</text>
  <text start="531.23" dur="5.13">to collect now in Louisiana we see that</text>
  <text start="534.35" dur="4.94">there&amp;#39;s about 46 percent of the</text>
  <text start="536.36" dur="6.78">population in Louisiana who are in debt</text>
  <text start="539.29" dur="6.34">44 percent in Texas 43 percent in South</text>
  <text start="543.14" dur="3.14">Carolina which I mean when I say they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="545.63" dur="5.52">in debt</text>

  <text start="563.12" dur="5.34">debtor nation and we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot</text>
  <text start="566.9" dur="3.45">of these numbers they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="568.46" dur="3.69">revised and we&amp;#39;re gonna get the real</text>
  <text start="570.35" dur="5.96">information when the retailer&amp;#39;s start to</text>
  <text start="572.15" dur="7.2">produce their real profit revenue sales</text>
  <text start="576.31" dur="5.98">numbers but we can see right now there</text>
  <text start="579.35" dur="6.9">is a 20-18 Deathwatch of certain</text>
  <text start="582.29" dur="5.3">retailers Clair stores well it looks</text>
  <text start="586.25" dur="3.56">like they are on</text>

  <text start="616.89" dur="6.28">we see that Nine West we know that they</text>
  <text start="620.44" dur="4.11">declare bankruptcy in 2017 and it looks</text>
  <text start="623.17" dur="4.14">like they might be closing a lot more</text>
  <text start="624.55" dur="5.01">stores GNC was actually doing well and</text>

  <text start="640.66" dur="4.5">and as we move forward</text>
  <text start="643.06" dur="4.86">I think things are just gonna get worse</text>
  <text start="645.16" dur="4.23">and worse and I think these numbers that</text>
  <text start="647.92" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re putting out there is trying to</text>
  <text start="649.39" dur="3.93">convince everyone that this holiday</text>

  <text start="663.04" dur="4.53">this number that we have right now is</text>
  <text start="665.94" dur="4.41">absolutely awful</text>
  <text start="667.57" dur="6.09">this is not a good retail number and</text>
  <text start="670.35" dur="4.36">again once the retailers come out and</text>

  <text start="695.08" dur="7.23">seem like it&amp;#39;s incredible now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="699.46" dur="4.53">very interesting is that the Fed is out</text>
  <text start="702.31" dur="2.97">there and we mentioned this many times</text>
  <text start="703.99" dur="4.71">before where they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="705.28" dur="6">not seeing any red flashing signals that</text>
  <text start="708.7" dur="4.5">the market there&amp;#39;s a problem they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="711.28" dur="4.53">see any indicators of financial</text>

  <text start="715.81" dur="4.44">never going to let you know if there is</text>
  <text start="717.4" dur="4.349">because people will panic and their job</text>
  <text start="720.25" dur="3.389">is to hide that from</text>
  <text start="721.749" dur="3.84">so they can bring down the economy and</text>
  <text start="723.639" dur="3.841">steal your wealth they don&amp;#39;t want people</text>
  <text start="725.589" dur="3.381">to know what&amp;#39;s really going on remember</text>
  <text start="727.48" dur="4.409">they&amp;#39;re not part of the government</text>

  <text start="742.36" dur="5.189">yes there is a major problem with this</text>
  <text start="744.67" dur="5.849">but on December 5th the ofr released its</text>

  <text start="795.339" dur="4.141">going forward what is happening here is</text>
  <text start="798.069" dur="3.21">the Fed is trying to make it seem like</text>
  <text start="799.48" dur="4.799">everything is fine and what we&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="801.279" dur="5.91">seeing is that we have financial</text>

  <text start="807.189" dur="7.11">seeing red orange signals flashing</text>
  <text start="812.169" dur="4.08">everywhere and I just wanted to mention</text>
  <text start="814.299" dur="5.21">one other thing about retail we also</text>
  <text start="816.249" dur="6.45">need to keep in mind that the debt is</text>
  <text start="819.509" dur="5.26">coming due in 2018 so a lot of these</text>
  <text start="822.699" dur="4.49">retailers are going to have to pay up</text>

  <text start="831.279" dur="5.191">is not money to actually have this is</text>
  <text start="834.069" dur="4.08">going to be a problem because once we</text>
  <text start="836.47" dur="5.13">get the real information from the real</text>
  <text start="838.149" dur="5.79">to the retailers and we find out what</text>
  <text start="841.6" dur="4.919">sales they have what their revenue is</text>
  <text start="843.939" dur="6.15">what profits they made and how much they</text>
  <text start="846.519" dur="6.841">owe on this debt well we&amp;#39;re gonna see a</text>
  <text start="850.089" dur="4.821">lot of problems happening now we</text>
  <text start="853.36" dur="4.1">understand the crypto</text>
  <text start="854.91" dur="5.01">it continually surges up that dropped a</text>
  <text start="857.46" dur="3.93">little bit and keep moving up and like I</text>
  <text start="859.92" dur="4.65">said before the crypto market is</text>
  <text start="861.39" dur="5.07">incredible it&amp;#39;s a decentralized system</text>
  <text start="864.57" dur="4.56">in the hands of the people</text>
  <text start="866.46" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s a an incredible system same thing</text>
  <text start="869.13" dur="5.13">with gold and silver in the hands of the</text>
  <text start="871.56" dur="4.11">people keeping everything on the</text>
  <text start="874.26" dur="5.34">up-and-up just like with cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="875.67" dur="6.75">it is an incredible system it&amp;#39;s when the</text>
  <text start="879.6" dur="4.68">central bankers get involved that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="882.42" dur="4.26">everything breaks down because they</text>
  <text start="884.28" dur="4.74">don&amp;#39;t like gold and silver they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="886.68" dur="4.89">like a decentralized system where the</text>
  <text start="889.02" dur="6.03">people can they can control everything</text>
  <text start="891.57" dur="5.97">and what they&amp;#39;re pushing for is their</text>
  <text start="895.05" dur="5.13">own type of coin in the crypto market</text>
  <text start="897.54" dur="5.73">because they see what the crypto market</text>
  <text start="900.18" dur="5.28">is now the Washington Post was pushing a</text>
  <text start="903.27" dur="3.66">piece about the Fed coin they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="905.46" dur="3.39">it doesn&amp;#39;t exist yet but I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="906.93" dur="5.25">waiting in the wings but one thing that</text>
  <text start="908.85" dur="6.86">we do know that does exist already and</text>
  <text start="912.18" dur="6.69">we talked about this before where UBS</text>
  <text start="915.71" dur="5.62">being why Mellon deutsche bank Santander</text>
  <text start="918.87" dur="4.56">and many other banks they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="921.33" dur="4.89">working on their own crypto coin and</text>
  <text start="923.43" dur="8.09">this crypto coin is called utility</text>
  <text start="926.22" dur="9.33">settlement coin sounds very familiar and</text>
  <text start="931.52" dur="8.07">I mean it sounds like a familiar name I</text>
  <text start="935.55" dur="7.59">should say and this is real they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="939.59" dur="5.98">developing this for quite a while right</text>
  <text start="943.14" dur="6.62">now and the banks have been testing this</text>
  <text start="945.57" dur="7.08">now the ultimate goal of this project is</text>
  <text start="949.76" dur="5.56">to create a digital currency known as</text>
  <text start="952.65" dur="5.37">utility settlement coin which will</text>
  <text start="955.32" dur="5.16">facilitate payment and settlement for</text>

  <text start="960.48" dur="4.59">what the official Deutsche Bank website</text>

  <text start="1027.35" dur="5.359">experimentation on blockchain</text>
  <text start="1029.53" dur="5.83">now they&amp;#39;re going to be pushing this out</text>
  <text start="1032.709" dur="4.211">because they&amp;#39;re almost done testing it</text>
  <text start="1035.36" dur="5.19">and they&amp;#39;re going to be trying to</text>

  <text start="1040.55" dur="6.24">blockchain system with the USC and I</text>
  <text start="1045.26" dur="3.81">think what they&amp;#39;re going to try to do is</text>
  <text start="1046.79" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to transition everyone</text>
  <text start="1049.07" dur="4.59">into this now is everyone going to go</text>
  <text start="1051.35" dur="5.49">willingly and say well let&amp;#39;s go to the</text>
  <text start="1053.66" dur="5.22">central bank&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s use their system no</text>
  <text start="1056.84" dur="7.26">of course not they&amp;#39;re gonna stick with</text>
  <text start="1058.88" dur="8.16">Bitcoin bit cash - litecoin and any</text>
  <text start="1064.1" dur="9.54">other cryptocurrency out there now the</text>
  <text start="1067.04" dur="9.42">problem is is if the central bank&amp;#39;s push</text>
  <text start="1073.64" dur="5.279">the government not just the United</text>
  <text start="1076.46" dur="6.03">States but other governments into</text>
  <text start="1078.919" dur="6.961">creating laws this is how the central</text>
  <text start="1082.49" dur="10.22">bank&amp;#39;s infiltrated our system in the</text>
  <text start="1085.88" dur="10.11">first place they had Congress pass laws</text>
  <text start="1092.71" dur="5.95">they had each state vote on it and they</text>
  <text start="1095.99" dur="7.23">said yes all the states agreed and the</text>
  <text start="1098.66" dur="7.5">central bank was born in 1913 because</text>
  <text start="1103.22" dur="5.55">without that nobody was going to use the</text>
  <text start="1106.16" dur="7.55">Federal Reserve Note nobody really cared</text>
  <text start="1108.77" dur="9.539">about it the same thing here if they get</text>
  <text start="1113.71" dur="7.719">Congress and this is created into and</text>
  <text start="1118.309" dur="5">and made into law not just you now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1121.429" dur="5.85">but in other countries</text>
  <text start="1123.309" dur="5.95">everyone will have to use this yes you</text>
  <text start="1127.279" dur="3.24">probably could still use Bitcoin you can</text>
  <text start="1129.259" dur="3.061">still unless they decide to get rid of</text>
  <text start="1130.519" dur="4.14">them and I think this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1132.32" dur="3.599">seeing this surge in Bitcoin in a lot of</text>
  <text start="1134.659" dur="3.21">these crypto currencies because this is</text>
  <text start="1135.919" dur="3.72">how the central bank was play they like</text>
  <text start="1137.869" dur="4.11">to pump this up and they can buy a lot</text>
  <text start="1139.639" dur="5.04">of this with free money and then drop it</text>
  <text start="1141.979" dur="6.33">and say hey this is volatile it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1144.679" dur="7.261">safe look what we have we have the USC</text>
  <text start="1148.309" dur="5.881">and it just so happens we&amp;#39;re pushing the</text>
  <text start="1151.94" dur="3.9">government to make this law that this is</text>
  <text start="1154.19" dur="3.479">what you have to use because those other</text>
  <text start="1155.84" dur="4.139">crypto currencies they&amp;#39;re very dangerous</text>
  <text start="1157.669" dur="4.83">and this is why they&amp;#39;ve been in</text>
  <text start="1159.979" dur="4.56">manipulating gold and silver for a long</text>
  <text start="1162.499" dur="6.3">time with paper contracts this is why</text>
  <text start="1164.539" dur="6">they set up a futures contract for</text>
  <text start="1168.799" dur="4.95">Bitcoin because they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1170.539" dur="5.25">control it all and shift everyone away</text>
  <text start="1173.749" dur="4.081">into their new system and I do believe</text>
  <text start="1175.789" dur="3.24">their new system is going to be made up</text>
  <text start="1177.83" dur="4.229">of many different things I think in a</text>
  <text start="1179.029" dur="4.86">high-level countries will be trading</text>
  <text start="1182.059" dur="4.17">maybe the petrol you want and using that</text>
  <text start="1183.889" dur="3.36">and at a lower level they&amp;#39;re gonna want</text>
  <text start="1186.229" dur="2.66">everyone to use the cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="1187.249" dur="4.53">because this will be a cashless society</text>
  <text start="1188.889" dur="3.941">but they want everyone to use theirs and</text>
  <text start="1191.779" dur="2.911">I think this is what they&amp;#39;re gonna try</text>
  <text start="1192.83" dur="4.559">to push for I think this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1194.69" dur="4.619">trying to position themselves in in the</text>
  <text start="1197.389" dur="4.23">blockchain technology I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1199.309" dur="3.6">trying to transition everyone into this</text>
  <text start="1201.619" dur="3">and I think this is the play they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1202.909" dur="3.39">going to try to make and I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="1204.619" dur="2.91">that cryptocurrencies is bad I like</text>
  <text start="1206.299" dur="3.661">cryptocurrency I think it&amp;#39;s a fantastic</text>
  <text start="1207.529" dur="4.35">thing the problem is is when central</text>
  <text start="1209.96" dur="4.019">bankers get involved I love gold and</text>
  <text start="1211.879" dur="4.65">silver the problem is is when central</text>
  <text start="1213.979" dur="4.14">bankers get involved if we remove</text>
  <text start="1216.529" dur="4.5">central bankers these two systems are</text>
  <text start="1218.119" dur="5.01">fantastic actually any system would be</text>
  <text start="1221.029" dur="3.811">fantastic without the central banks so</text>
  <text start="1223.129" dur="4.23">you can see right now we are headed into</text>
  <text start="1224.84" dur="5.039">a period of time when everything is</text>
  <text start="1227.359" dur="4.65">transitioning the economy I know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1229.879" dur="5.49">telling us the economy is doing great it</text>
  <text start="1232.009" dur="5.431">really is and nothing has changed since</text>
  <text start="1235.369" dur="3.81">Trump came into office yes he&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="1237.44" dur="5.01">many different things but the economy</text>
  <text start="1239.179" dur="5.041">was always dying you can&amp;#39;t just flip a</text>
  <text start="1242.45" dur="5.64">switch and all of a sudden the economy</text>
  <text start="1244.22" dur="6.899">you know starts to happen we have 20</text>
  <text start="1248.09" dur="5.12">trillion dollars worth of debt most of</text>
  <text start="1251.119" dur="4.11">the people don&amp;#39;t have full paying jobs a</text>
  <text start="1253.21" dur="3.059">lot of the retailers have been laying</text>
  <text start="1255.229" dur="3.98">off thousands upon</text>
  <text start="1256.269" dur="5.49">thousands of people and once again we</text>
  <text start="1259.209" dur="5.82">can see all the numbers have been</text>
  <text start="1261.759" dur="5.88">manipulated unemployment GDP you name it</text>
  <text start="1265.029" dur="5.671">they manipulate it so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1267.639" dur="5.61">here is this attempt to make it look</text>
  <text start="1270.7" dur="5.069">like everything is fantastic and this is</text>
  <text start="1273.249" dur="4.29">what they&amp;#39;ve done in the past because</text>
  <text start="1275.769" dur="3.931">what they want you to see is that</text>
  <text start="1277.539" dur="4.35">everything is great the central bank has</text>
  <text start="1279.7" dur="3.419">done their job and of course they want</text>
  <text start="1281.889" dur="4.22">some type of an event some type of</text>
  <text start="1283.119" dur="5.34">distraction to bring the system down</text>
  <text start="1286.109" dur="5.05">transfer it over to someplace else and</text>
  <text start="1288.459" dur="4.92">then say we need to use our new system</text>
  <text start="1291.159" dur="4.23">and I think this is their play I think</text>
  <text start="1293.379" dur="3.99">this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do they</text>
  <text start="1295.389" dur="3.57">just can&amp;#39;t figure out how they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1297.369" dur="4.831">to do it at this point</text>
  <text start="1298.959" dur="6.45">but they will figure out a way they will</text>
