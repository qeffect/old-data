  <text start="188.13" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;ve done to make their countries</text>
  <text start="190.8" dur="4.74">great again remember the globalist plan</text>
  <text start="194.07" dur="4.89">the central bank plan the deep state</text>
  <text start="195.54" dur="6.38">plan was not to have these individual</text>
  <text start="198.96" dur="6.75">countries was to have just one world</text>
  <text start="201.92" dur="6.1">where an unelected leader would control</text>
  <text start="205.71" dur="5.07">all of this where there&amp;#39;d be one central</text>

  <text start="231.99" dur="5.43">people say currency is created all of</text>
  <text start="234.12" dur="6">this is going to change but we need to</text>
  <text start="237.42" dur="6.69">get there and we are going to get there</text>
  <text start="240.12" dur="6.99">the plan is moving forward now for a</text>
  <text start="244.11" dur="5.37">very long time we&amp;#39;ve been discussing</text>
  <text start="247.11" dur="8.07">gold silver and if you notice gold is</text>
  <text start="249.48" dur="8.34">now above 1,400 holding steady and I do</text>
  <text start="255.18" dur="4.76">believe that gold is going to be moving</text>
  <text start="257.82" dur="5.7">up yes we&amp;#39;re gonna see Bob&amp;#39;s up and down</text>
  <text start="259.94" dur="5.92">but eventually gold is going to take off</text>
  <text start="263.52" dur="4.62">and we&amp;#39;ve been talking about gold and</text>
  <text start="265.86" dur="4.41">precious metals and how they are</text>
  <text start="268.14" dur="4.47">manipulated now of course many people</text>
  <text start="270.27" dur="4.74">out there saying absolutely not it is</text>
  <text start="272.61" dur="5.91">not manipulated but the Justice</text>
  <text start="275.01" dur="5.52">Department came out and a former</text>

  <text start="282.92" dur="5.32">pleaded guilty today to attempted price</text>
  <text start="285.81" dur="4.76">manipulation of precious metal future</text>
  <text start="288.24" dur="4.35">contracts and this was announced by</text>
  <text start="290.57" dur="5.02">Assistant Attorney General Brian</text>
  <text start="292.59" dur="6.57">Pankowski of the Justice Department</text>

  <text start="301.47" dur="4.26">District of New York to an information</text>
  <text start="303.33" dur="4.61">charging him with one count of attempted</text>
  <text start="305.73" dur="4.92">commodities price manipulation</text>
  <text start="307.94" dur="4.45">according to admissions made as part of</text>

  <text start="312.39" dur="8.16">court between approximately June 2007</text>
  <text start="315.33" dur="7.71">and July 2016 flowers and thousands of</text>
  <text start="320.55" dur="4.95">orders to manipulate the price of gold</text>
  <text start="323.04" dur="4.77">silver platinum and palladium future</text>
  <text start="325.5" dur="5.43">contracts traded on the New York</text>

  <text start="334.23" dur="6.87">commodities exchanged operated by CME</text>
  <text start="336.84" dur="6.78">Group Inc so how did he do this well he</text>
  <text start="341.1" dur="4.77">routinely placed orders for precious</text>
  <text start="343.62" dur="5.66">metal future contracts with the intent</text>
  <text start="345.87" dur="6.45">to cancel those orders before execution</text>
  <text start="349.28" dur="5.71">this trading strategy was intended to</text>
  <text start="352.32" dur="4.65">deceive other market participants about</text>
  <text start="354.99" dur="4.86">the existence of supply and demand and</text>
  <text start="356.97" dur="4.95">to artificially move the price of</text>
  <text start="359.85" dur="5.39">precious metal future contracts in a</text>
  <text start="361.92" dur="8.34">direction that was favorable to him and</text>
  <text start="365.24" dur="7.6">the two banks he worked for this is a</text>
  <text start="370.26" dur="6.57">little fish this is what the central</text>
  <text start="372.84" dur="7.2">bank does on a much larger scale now</text>
  <text start="376.83" dur="5.16">think about this I don&amp;#39;t believe there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="380.04" dur="4.05">an individual now in the basement you</text>
  <text start="381.99" dur="4.77">know moving levers and pushing buttons</text>
  <text start="384.09" dur="5.61">and dumping future contracts</text>
  <text start="386.76" dur="5.97">from the central bank I believe what</text>
  <text start="389.7" dur="5.79">they have happening is there are many</text>
  <text start="392.73" dur="5.13">individuals in many different banks just</text>
  <text start="395.49" dur="4.56">like banks they just create currency out</text>
  <text start="397.86" dur="3.36">of thin air today most of it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="400.05" dur="4.2">even come out of the central bank</text>
  <text start="401.22" dur="5.22">anymore they diversified it across many</text>
  <text start="404.25" dur="5.34">banks I do believe that there are many</text>
  <text start="406.44" dur="5.61">banks that are in on this yes we have</text>
  <text start="409.59" dur="4.73">this individual we know that we had</text>
  <text start="412.05" dur="4.62">others that have been brought up and</text>
  <text start="414.32" dur="4.15">charged with the same exact crime but I</text>
  <text start="416.67" dur="6.18">think there are many many many of these</text>
  <text start="418.47" dur="6.42">individuals and this allows them to</text>
  <text start="422.85" dur="4.98">control the precious metals market and</text>
  <text start="424.89" dur="3.81">make it seem like it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="427.83" dur="2.31">natural</text>
  <text start="428.7" dur="3.48">remember they just don&amp;#39;t want a</text>
  <text start="430.14" dur="4.26">centralized person just throwing</text>
  <text start="432.18" dur="3.84">contracts and everyone points them and</text>
  <text start="434.4" dur="4.5">saying hey what is this person doing if</text>
  <text start="436.02" dur="4.86">you have it decentralized among all</text>
  <text start="438.9" dur="4.44">different banks and they have different</text>
  <text start="440.88" dur="5.4">people doing the same thing it looks</text>
  <text start="443.34" dur="6.65">natural and I do believe this is how</text>
  <text start="446.28" dur="7.56">they do it and what we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="449.99" dur="6.76">very soon when this entire thing starts</text>
  <text start="453.84" dur="4.77">to fall apart when we enter crisis mode</text>
  <text start="456.75" dur="4.35">you&amp;#39;re going to see the manipulation</text>
  <text start="458.61" dur="5.69">completely stop you&amp;#39;re going to see gold</text>
  <text start="461.1" dur="5.94">start to rise and this is an indicator</text>
  <text start="464.3" dur="4.9">that everything is about to change</text>
  <text start="467.04" dur="5.88">because once gold starts to move up</text>
  <text start="469.2" dur="6.99">guess what we&amp;#39;re getting ready to make</text>
  <text start="472.92" dur="6.21">the switch the transition into the new</text>
  <text start="476.19" dur="4.77">system now is gold gonna be 1800 1900</text>
  <text start="479.13" dur="3.45">2000 and we&amp;#39;re gonna make the transition</text>
  <text start="480.96" dur="3.78">no I think it&amp;#39;s gonna be much much</text>
  <text start="482.58" dur="5.67">higher than that but before we get there</text>
  <text start="484.74" dur="7.17">we need to get through this next</text>
  <text start="488.25" dur="7.08">election Trump the Patriots they need</text>
  <text start="491.91" dur="6.48">time because this entire system this</text>
  <text start="495.33" dur="6.33">entire central bank system which spans</text>
  <text start="498.39" dur="6.18">across the world it is collapsing and at</text>
  <text start="501.66" dur="5.58">an accelerated rate and this is why</text>
  <text start="504.57" dur="4.53">Trump has been contradicting the Fed</text>
  <text start="507.24" dur="3.36">this is what Trump is out there saying</text>
  <text start="509.1" dur="3.99">hey the Fed should really lower rates</text>
  <text start="510.6" dur="4.77">the Fed should start stimulus it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="513.09" dur="5.37">because he understands he needs this</text>
  <text start="515.37" dur="6.51">time now that the mainstream media the</text>
  <text start="518.46" dur="7.38">deep state they want the system to</text>
  <text start="521.88" dur="6.21">collapse before the elections the reason</text>
  <text start="525.84" dur="4.29">they want this is because this would</text>
  <text start="528.09" dur="4.23">allow them to put their candidate in</text>
  <text start="530.13" dur="4.32">place and they can say oh look Trump</text>
  <text start="532.32" dur="4.86">collapsed the economy he&amp;#39;s no good</text>
  <text start="534.45" dur="4.53">people will lose faith here&amp;#39;s the new</text>
  <text start="537.18" dur="4.97">person they&amp;#39;re gonna make it all better</text>
  <text start="538.98" dur="8.63">think think about it go back in time</text>
  <text start="542.15" dur="9.05">when Obama was running back in 2008</text>
  <text start="547.61" dur="6.659">and who else was there we had McCain</text>
  <text start="551.2" dur="5.16">McCain was completely clueless on the</text>
  <text start="554.269" dur="5.94">economy he thought everything was fine</text>
  <text start="556.36" dur="7.69">Obama well they let him know what the</text>
  <text start="560.209" dur="6.961">plan was and he was out there saying the</text>
  <text start="564.05" dur="5.13">economy is failing the economy is going</text>
  <text start="567.17" dur="3.93">to collapse the economy is not doing</text>
  <text start="569.18" dur="4.08">well McCain had a completely different</text>
  <text start="571.1" dur="7.29">message and that&amp;#39;s exactly what happened</text>
  <text start="573.26" dur="7.199">and since that happened people saw Bhama</text>
  <text start="578.39" dur="5.36">as being in touch with the economy and</text>
  <text start="580.459" dur="5.781">McCain being completely out of touch and</text>
  <text start="583.75" dur="5.44">they&amp;#39;re trying to do the same thing</text>
  <text start="586.24" dur="5.349">coming into the 2020 election but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="589.19" dur="5.04">going to fail but the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="591.589" dur="6.69">they&amp;#39;re trying their best they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="594.23" dur="6.96">to control the economic narrative now</text>
  <text start="598.279" dur="6.151">this is coming out of CNBC and their</text>
  <text start="601.19" dur="6.78">headline is why the Fed could be setting</text>
  <text start="604.43" dur="5.46">stocks up for a painful drop and they</text>
  <text start="607.97" dur="4.47">have this market watcher on their Dan</text>
  <text start="609.89" dur="5.37">Suzuki and he&amp;#39;s warning that the</text>
  <text start="612.44" dur="4.8">correction risks are rising and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="615.26" dur="4.439">nothing the Federal Reserve can do about</text>
  <text start="617.24" dur="6.57">it and if they drop the rates the market</text>
  <text start="619.699" dur="6.211">is going to come down well that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="623.81" dur="5.07">what&amp;#39;s going to happen remember who has</text>
  <text start="625.91" dur="4.77">the magic wand do you think Trump is out</text>
  <text start="628.88" dur="4.38">there telling the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="630.68" dur="5.19">listen drop the rates start stimulus and</text>
  <text start="633.26" dur="5.699">we&amp;#39;re gonna have the market crash no he</text>
  <text start="635.87" dur="5.67">knows exactly what&amp;#39;s going to happen he</text>
  <text start="638.959" dur="5.341">knows we&amp;#39;re going to get a one and a</text>
  <text start="641.54" dur="4.5">half to two year boost and he knows the</text>
  <text start="644.3" dur="5.19">market is going to skyrocket</text>
  <text start="646.04" dur="4.83">he knows this will help the economy and</text>
  <text start="649.49" dur="3.33">I don&amp;#39;t mean make it better make it</text>
  <text start="650.87" dur="4.86">functional it will make the statistical</text>
  <text start="652.82" dur="6.84">numbers look incredible for the next one</text>
  <text start="655.73" dur="6.539">and a half to two years that&amp;#39;s it then</text>
  <text start="659.66" dur="4.799">it will start to decline that little</text>
  <text start="662.269" dur="5.611">juice that the Federal Reserve will give</text>
  <text start="664.459" dur="7.141">the economy that little jolt that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="667.88" dur="5.94">it is and then it will start to fail but</text>
  <text start="671.6" dur="4.89">the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="673.82" dur="5.22">control this to trying to show that this</text>
  <text start="676.49" dur="4.47">is what&amp;#39;s going to happen this is what</text>
  <text start="679.04" dur="3.57">they want to happen just like they want</text>
  <text start="680.96" dur="4.59">rushon collusion but that never happened</text>
  <text start="682.61" dur="6.06">and they keep repeating this over and</text>
  <text start="685.55" dur="7.38">over we&amp;#39;re not going into a recession in</text>
  <text start="688.67" dur="6.99">2020 that would be ridiculous at this</text>
  <text start="692.93" dur="5.88">point because if we go into a recession</text>
  <text start="695.66" dur="6.66">in 2020 the entire plan the Patriots</text>
  <text start="698.81" dur="6.68">plan goes down the tubes and we know</text>
  <text start="702.32" dur="6.3">from cue that they&amp;#39;re going to stop this</text>
  <text start="705.49" dur="4.72">because they need the time to go after</text>
  <text start="708.62" dur="3.69">the central bank they need the time to</text>
  <text start="710.21" dur="6.72">put the players in place they need the</text>
  <text start="712.31" dur="8.7">time to transition the entire system</text>
  <text start="716.93" dur="8.52">into a stable sound money goal back</text>
  <text start="721.01" dur="8.1">system and they&amp;#39;re going to do this and</text>
  <text start="725.45" dur="6.18">we&amp;#39;re gonna see the Fed dropped drop the</text>
  <text start="729.11" dur="5.15">rates they&amp;#39;re gonna cut them and later</text>
