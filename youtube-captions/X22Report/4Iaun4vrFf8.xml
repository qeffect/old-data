  <text start="93.409" dur="5.431">going to see this ramp up and we know</text>

  <text start="108.5" dur="5.01">traders they&amp;#39;re trying to keep it as</text>
  <text start="111.07" dur="6.64">high as they possibly can because this</text>
  <text start="113.51" dur="6.54">is the last tool they have to show</text>
  <text start="117.71" dur="4.44">everyone that the economy is fine even</text>
  <text start="120.05" dur="5.609">though it&amp;#39;s falling apart behind the</text>
  <text start="122.15" dur="5.82">scenes this is what&amp;#39;s standing out in</text>
  <text start="125.659" dur="3.75">front letting everyone know that</text>
  <text start="127.97" dur="4.26">everything is fine but we know it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="129.409" dur="4.891">and as more and more companies layoff</text>
  <text start="132.23" dur="5.07">and as we get more and more these</text>
  <text start="134.3" dur="6.75">economic indicators that the economy is</text>
  <text start="137.3" dur="6.18">continually collapsing is just going to</text>
  <text start="141.05" dur="4.71">get worse and their statistical numbers</text>
  <text start="143.48" dur="6.42">and their illusion is going to separate</text>
  <text start="145.76" dur="5.91">even further as we go into 2016 now</text>
  <text start="149.9" dur="4.919">we&amp;#39;re getting more layoffs like state</text>

  <text start="164" dur="6.48">laid off about a thousand people today</text>
  <text start="166.04" dur="9.41">and when we look at the economy right</text>
  <text start="170.48" dur="9.3">now it looks very very similar to 2008</text>
  <text start="175.45" dur="6.49">right before everything fell apart now</text>
  <text start="179.78" dur="3.45">we have to remember the US government</text>
  <text start="181.94" dur="3.44">central bankers they learned a lot from</text>
  <text start="183.23" dur="6.51">that crash they learned how to</text>
  <text start="185.38" dur="7.06">manipulate how to massage the numbers</text>
  <text start="189.74" dur="6.18">how to trick everyone into thinking that</text>
  <text start="192.44" dur="6.08">everything is okay they have the ability</text>
  <text start="195.92" dur="5.22">to create money by pushing a button and</text>
  <text start="198.52" dur="4.87">feeding it into the market to keep it</text>
  <text start="201.14" dur="4.65">propped up they created the plunge</text>
  <text start="203.39" dur="6.09">protection team to make sure the market</text>
  <text start="205.79" dur="9.8">is pretty much stable on a day to day</text>
  <text start="209.48" dur="10.35">basis and we see manufacturing retail</text>
  <text start="215.59" dur="6.34">housing unemployment telling a</text>
  <text start="219.83" dur="4.02">completely different story right now the</text>
  <text start="221.93" dur="4.23">Baltic Dry Index which is the raw</text>
  <text start="223.85" dur="5.19">material the factories use it&amp;#39;s staying</text>
  <text start="226.16" dur="5.329">steady at 774 points now usually this is</text>
  <text start="229.04" dur="4.89">the time of year where this number</text>
  <text start="231.489" dur="5.201">increases because the raw material the</text>
  <text start="233.93" dur="6.48">factories use to produce goods and other</text>
  <text start="236.69" dur="5.85">products and they ship it all over the</text>
  <text start="240.41" dur="6.079">world and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="242.54" dur="6.449">since no one is purchasing</text>
  <text start="246.489" dur="4.631">Manufacturing&amp;#39;s manufacturing companies</text>
  <text start="248.989" dur="3.421">aren&amp;#39;t producing and since they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="251.12" dur="3.03">producing they don&amp;#39;t need the raw</text>
  <text start="252.41" dur="4.62">material so right now this numbers</text>
  <text start="254.15" dur="6.51">around 774 normally around this time of</text>
  <text start="257.03" dur="6.99">year it&amp;#39;s around 1,500 so we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="260.66" dur="7.53">considerable drop and it&amp;#39;s staying down</text>
  <text start="264.02" dur="6.57">low and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="268.19" dur="6.45">this is that we already know the housing</text>
  <text start="270.59" dur="6.329">market is crumbling and falling apart we</text>
  <text start="274.64" dur="4.89">know they&amp;#39;re doing the same exact tricks</text>
  <text start="276.919" dur="6.241">as they did in 2008 with the mortgages</text>
  <text start="279.53" dur="5.4">no down no money down anyone that has a</text>
  <text start="283.16" dur="3.42">heartbeat can come in and buy a loan you</text>
  <text start="284.93" dur="4.41">can get out just above rate mortgage it</text>
  <text start="286.58" dur="6.75">doesn&amp;#39;t matter and we&amp;#39;re seeing the auto</text>
  <text start="289.34" dur="7.56">loan market it&amp;#39;s beginning to look a lot</text>
  <text start="293.33" dur="5.15">like the housing market during the</text>
  <text start="296.9" dur="4.77">financial crisis</text>
  <text start="298.48" dur="5.68">banks right now can offload credit risks</text>
  <text start="301.67" dur="5.49">by packaging loans and selling abs to</text>
  <text start="304.16" dur="7.14">investors thus freeing up their balance</text>
  <text start="307.16" dur="6.15">sheets to make still more loans the race</text>
  <text start="311.3" dur="4.44">to get in on the action causes banks to</text>
  <text start="313.31" dur="5.37">compete for an even smaller pool of</text>
  <text start="315.74" dur="6.96">eligible borrowers Earp adds fuel to the</text>
  <text start="318.68" dur="7.02">fire by one enticing households to take</text>
  <text start="322.7" dur="5.46">on more debt creating demand for the ABS</text>
  <text start="325.7" dur="5.45">as investors hunt for yield in a low</text>
  <text start="328.16" dur="6.36">rate environment the pool of</text>
  <text start="331.15" dur="7.78">creditworthy borrowers is of course</text>
  <text start="334.52" dur="9.36">limited and so at a certain point the</text>
  <text start="338.93" dur="9.75">only way to generate more debt is to</text>
  <text start="343.88" dur="7.77">lower your underwriting standards so</text>
  <text start="348.68" dur="7.05">this is what we are seeing right now the</text>
  <text start="351.65" dur="8.16">total auto debt has now soared above the</text>
  <text start="355.73" dur="7.62">one trillion mark and it&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="359.81" dur="5.07">alongside the student loan debt and when</text>
  <text start="363.35" dur="3.24">you look at this and I have the graph on</text>
  <text start="364.88" dur="4.92">the x 22 report com those people on</text>
  <text start="366.59" dur="8.73">YouTube can see it what you&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="369.8" dur="11.28">as of 2008 the auto loan debt</text>
  <text start="375.32" dur="9.71">skyrocketed just like the national debt</text>
  <text start="381.08" dur="9.66">just like the student loan debt it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="385.03" dur="9.43">following the same path and this is what</text>
  <text start="390.74" dur="6.75">a bubble looks like what it shoots</text>
  <text start="394.46" dur="5.79">straight up because what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="397.49" dur="5.67">is they&amp;#39;re just getting anyone in that</text>
  <text start="400.25" dur="5.9">they possibly can to keep this bubble</text>
  <text start="403.16" dur="7.52">inflated now Comptroller of the currency</text>
  <text start="406.15" dur="8.2">Thomas curry raised a rare red flag and</text>
  <text start="410.68" dur="7.39">he said in a speech that some activity</text>
  <text start="414.35" dur="4.77">in auto loans reminds him of what</text>
  <text start="418.07" dur="4.52">happened in the mortgage-backed</text>
  <text start="419.12" dur="6.32">securities in the run-up of the crisis</text>
  <text start="422.59" dur="6.67">now during the first half of 2015</text>
  <text start="425.44" dur="5.88">lenders gave out 56.4 billion in</text>
  <text start="429.26" dur="4.43">subprime auto loans up</text>
  <text start="431.32" dur="6.87">team percent from the same period of</text>
  <text start="433.69" dur="7.14">last year and up a hundred and</text>
  <text start="438.19" dur="7.5">eighty-one percent from the first half</text>
  <text start="440.83" dur="6.75">of 2009 so you can see what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="445.69" dur="6.69">right here and all this information is</text>
  <text start="447.58" dur="7.74">coming from equifax subprime car loans</text>
  <text start="452.38" dur="6.57">they account for twenty percent of the</text>
  <text start="455.32" dur="6.39">car loan dollars right now given out</text>
  <text start="458.95" dur="7.04">from January through June this is the</text>
  <text start="461.71" dur="7.08">highest share for the period since 2008</text>
  <text start="465.99" dur="6.13">we&amp;#39;re seeing the same exact thing happen</text>
  <text start="468.79" dur="5.76">and they&amp;#39;re just using what they did</text>
  <text start="472.12" dur="7.95">back in 2007-2008 and prior to that</text>
  <text start="474.55" dur="11.79">right up to the crash due to build this</text>
  <text start="480.07" dur="10.23">bubble up to create an economy that it</text>
  <text start="486.34" dur="6.54">looks like we&amp;#39;re in a recovery now back</text>
  <text start="490.3" dur="4.62">in 2005-2006 people were out there</text>
  <text start="492.88" dur="3.48">saying listen this is a bubble this</text>
  <text start="494.92" dur="2.61">thing&amp;#39;s going to come down hard and it</text>
  <text start="496.36" dur="3.03">did in two thousand eight now of course</text>
  <text start="497.53" dur="3.09">we had all those other people saying</text>
  <text start="499.39" dur="3.39">this is ridiculous you don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="500.62" dur="3.57">you&amp;#39;re talking about look housing prices</text>
  <text start="502.78" dur="3.72">are just going to continually go up</text>
  <text start="504.19" dur="4.98">actually the Fed even said when have you</text>
  <text start="506.5" dur="5.13">ever seen housing prices go down houses</text>
  <text start="509.17" dur="5.73">always sell well that wasn&amp;#39;t the case</text>
  <text start="511.63" dur="6.48">and we&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing happened</text>
  <text start="514.9" dur="6.6">right now just because the market the</text>
  <text start="518.11" dur="5.76">stock market fluctuates it goes up it</text>
  <text start="521.5" dur="5.94">goes down that&amp;#39;s meaningless because one</text>
  <text start="523.87" dur="5.67">day just like in 2008 remember the</text>
  <text start="527.44" dur="3.93">market was continually going up going up</text>
  <text start="529.54" dur="5.07">going up we had some fluctuations in</text>
  <text start="531.37" dur="4.8">August everyone said oh don&amp;#39;t worry the</text>
  <text start="534.61" dur="3.69">markets going back up again everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="536.17" dur="3.66">okay and then all of a sudden one day</text>
  <text start="538.3" dur="3.99">snap of a finger everything came</text>
  <text start="539.83" dur="5.55">crashing down this is what we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="542.29" dur="6.03">to say and a couple days ago in a report</text>
  <text start="545.38" dur="6.15">I was talking about oil and why they</text>
  <text start="548.32" dur="6.33">were suppressing it so hard and I</text>
  <text start="551.53" dur="5.13">started to realize that it&amp;#39;s not just to</text>
  <text start="554.65" dur="4.08">put a lot of pressure on Russia but I</text>
  <text start="556.66" dur="4.95">was looking at a lot of companies here</text>
  <text start="558.73" dur="6">in the United States and companies like</text>
  <text start="561.61" dur="8.43">UPS FedEx the airline&amp;#39;s food</text>
  <text start="564.73" dur="8.49">you name it anyone that uses fuel it</text>
  <text start="570.04" dur="6.03">this helps them and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="573.22" dur="5.309">get proof that yeah this is really</text>
  <text start="576.07" dur="5.04">helping the companies because if they</text>
  <text start="578.529" dur="5.87">didn&amp;#39;t suppress the oil prices and force</text>
  <text start="581.11" dur="6.75">Saudi Arabia to do what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="584.399" dur="6.521">this economy would have collapsed</text>
  <text start="587.86" dur="4.95">already now there was an article out</text>
  <text start="590.92" dur="5.34">there and they&amp;#39;re talking about American</text>
  <text start="592.81" dur="6.779">Airlines third quarter profits how they</text>
  <text start="596.26" dur="4.889">soared why do they soar it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="599.589" dur="3.87">because they were doing better it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="601.149" dur="8.041">because they were making more sales it</text>
  <text start="603.459" dur="8.88">was because of cheaper jet fuel so think</text>
  <text start="609.19" dur="5.31">about this for a second the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="612.339" dur="4.711">biggest airline reported on Friday that</text>
  <text start="614.5" dur="4.56">its net income jumped eighty percent in</text>
  <text start="617.05" dur="7.77">the third quarter to one point six nine</text>
  <text start="619.06" dur="9.95">billion despite low revenue earnings got</text>
  <text start="624.82" dur="8.3">a big lift as fuel costs plunged</text>
  <text start="629.01" dur="9.97">forty-three percent saving the company</text>
  <text start="633.12" dur="7.99">1.4 6 billion dollars and when people</text>
  <text start="638.98" dur="5.37">say oh why are the oil prices come down</text>
  <text start="641.11" dur="5.82">oh it&amp;#39;s great look I&amp;#39;m getting I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="644.35" dur="5.76">have to put that much money into the car</text>
  <text start="646.93" dur="7.26">right now because I with less money I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="650.11" dur="7.349">getting more gas but the central bankers</text>
  <text start="654.19" dur="6.06">and the US government they&amp;#39;re tricking</text>
  <text start="657.459" dur="4.44">everyone right now making you feel and</text>
  <text start="660.25" dur="3.63">I&amp;#39;m talking to a lot of people they feel</text>
  <text start="661.899" dur="5.071">the economy is doing much much better</text>
  <text start="663.88" dur="5.18">now because oil prices have come down so</text>
  <text start="666.97" dur="5.82">much and they&amp;#39;re continually dropping</text>
  <text start="669.06" dur="6.25">this is a trick to make you think</text>
  <text start="672.79" dur="5.789">everything is fine there every time you</text>
  <text start="675.31" dur="6.35">see something happen they do this for a</text>
  <text start="678.579" dur="6.031">specific reason or many specific reasons</text>
  <text start="681.66" dur="4.119">now we came out and we said that yes</text>
  <text start="684.61" dur="3.24">this is happening to put a lot of</text>
  <text start="685.779" dur="6.5">pressure on Russia but I think the main</text>
  <text start="687.85" dur="8.15">agenda here was to keep corporations</text>
  <text start="692.279" dur="6.761">operational to keep this economy</text>
  <text start="696" dur="6.839">continually moving forward</text>
  <text start="699.04" dur="9.9">because without this and if fuel was at</text>
  <text start="702.839" dur="8.11">three fifty four dollars guess what we</text>
  <text start="708.94" dur="4.079">would have seen a collapse and mass</text>
  <text start="710.949" dur="4.111">layoffs you have to remember the central</text>
  <text start="713.019" dur="4.351">bankers they will do whatever they</text>
  <text start="715.06" dur="4.44">possibly can to keep this system going</text>
  <text start="717.37" dur="3.93">until the very very end because they</text>
  <text start="719.5" dur="4.079">want to bring it down themselves if they</text>
  <text start="721.3" dur="5.19">let this crash it will all be blamed on</text>
  <text start="723.579" dur="4.771">them and when we start looking at</text>
  <text start="726.49" dur="4.349">companies and why they&amp;#39;re making profits</text>
  <text start="728.35" dur="5.669">and what they&amp;#39;re actually doing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="730.839" dur="6.901">seeing sales revenue it&amp;#39;s falling apart</text>
