  <text start="315.26" dur="6.45">wanted to go over this burn a key quote</text>
  <text start="317.69" dur="6.12">again using our common sense now Ben</text>
  <text start="321.71" dur="4.14">Bernanke is head of the Fed he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="323.81" dur="5.13">printing money he&amp;#39;s making sure the</text>
  <text start="325.85" dur="4.92">economy is is doing better it&amp;#39;s not</text>

  <text start="339.919" dur="4.831">to balance the interest rates and when</text>
  <text start="342.47" dur="6.449">the Senate they asked him a simple</text>
  <text start="344.75" dur="8.34">question you know and his answer to the</text>
  <text start="348.919" dur="7.831">question is we have no idea how much</text>
  <text start="353.09" dur="6.21">money were giving the banks are you</text>
  <text start="356.75" dur="6.96">kidding me are you trying to tell me</text>

  <text start="378.56" dur="6.15">secondly he has no obligation reporting</text>
  <text start="382.16" dur="4.229">this to the government because the</text>
  <text start="384.71" dur="4.769">Federal Reserve is not part of the</text>
  <text start="386.389" dur="6.84">government but to me with everyone out</text>

  <text start="408.98" dur="7.18">subsidy were giving the banks well let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="413.22" dur="5.79">let&amp;#39;s use our common sense again isn&amp;#39;t</text>
