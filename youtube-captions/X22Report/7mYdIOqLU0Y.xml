  <text start="128.46" dur="8.07">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="130.95" dur="8.67">now we realize that egypt air that</text>
  <text start="136.53" dur="4.5">crashed in the mediterranean and they</text>
  <text start="139.62" dur="2.82">were looking for the black boxes they</text>
  <text start="141.03" dur="3.45">found the black box as they said the</text>
  <text start="142.44" dur="5.129">black boxes were damaged during that</text>
  <text start="144.48" dur="5.64">time we know that the US and Israel and</text>
  <text start="147.569" dur="4.561">other nations were having some type of</text>
  <text start="150.12" dur="6.12">military drill at the same exact time in</text>
  <text start="152.13" dur="5.88">the same area now they found the</text>
  <text start="156.24" dur="6.21">recorders they were trying to repair</text>
  <text start="158.01" dur="5.71">them and they have repaired them and the</text>
  <text start="162.45" dur="3.64">black boxes Jeff</text>
  <text start="163.72" dur="4.38">that the plane caught on fire before</text>
  <text start="166.09" dur="5.4">disappearing from radars and plunging</text>
  <text start="168.1" dur="6.39">into the Mediterranean now the experts</text>
  <text start="171.49" dur="5.9">they&amp;#39;re hoping the black box data will</text>
  <text start="174.49" dur="6">shed the light on the sequence of events</text>
  <text start="177.39" dur="6.25">preceding the crash because they want to</text>
  <text start="180.49" dur="5.16">know where did this fire come from and</text>
  <text start="183.64" dur="5.3">we can see right now that when they took</text>
  <text start="185.65" dur="5.52">off from charles de gaulle airport</text>
  <text start="188.94" dur="4.66">everything was fine the box was</text>
  <text start="191.17" dur="6.18">recording and then all of a sudden at an</text>
  <text start="193.6" dur="6.72">altitude of about 37,000 feet everything</text>
  <text start="197.35" dur="6.93">just went blank so they&amp;#39;re looking for</text>
  <text start="200.32" dur="6.57">the cockpit voice recorder they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="204.28" dur="6.45">hoping they&amp;#39;ll be able to listen to it</text>
  <text start="206.89" dur="8.819">and hopefully get a transcript from it</text>
  <text start="210.73" dur="7.02">to understand what happened and we can</text>
  <text start="215.709" dur="3.031">see right now they&amp;#39;re not very sure</text>
  <text start="217.75" dur="3.68">they&amp;#39;re trying to put all the pieces</text>
  <text start="218.74" dur="6.09">together and we&amp;#39;ll have to wait to see</text>
  <text start="221.43" dur="7.27">why this airplane came out of the sky so</text>
  <text start="224.83" dur="6">suddenly now out in Italy something very</text>
  <text start="228.7" dur="3.93">interesting is happening and we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="230.83" dur="4.5">just seeing in Italy we&amp;#39;re seeing it in</text>
  <text start="232.63" dur="4.44">France and many other countries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="235.33" dur="2.64">starting to look at the situation and</text>
  <text start="237.07" dur="3.51">saying you know something these</text>
  <text start="237.97" dur="7.769">sanctions against Russia they are not</text>
  <text start="240.58" dur="8.1">benefiting our country it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="245.739" dur="5.461">doing more harm than good we know the</text>
  <text start="248.68" dur="4.98">United States wants these sanctions but</text>
  <text start="251.2" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s not working out for us so the</text>
  <text start="253.66" dur="3.75">parliament in northwestern Italy has</text>
  <text start="255.82" dur="4.77">voted in favor of a resolution to</text>
  <text start="257.41" dur="8.88">recognize Crimea as part of Russia and</text>
  <text start="260.59" dur="6.96">lift the sanctions from Russia which is</text>
  <text start="266.29" dur="4.11">something they might want to do right</text>
  <text start="267.55" dur="6.869">now because as we can see the entire</text>
  <text start="270.4" dur="6.24">situation was created by the United</text>
  <text start="274.419" dur="6.361">States government central bankers now</text>
  <text start="276.64" dur="7.08">Obama he was in Canada as we know given</text>
  <text start="280.78" dur="6.65">speeches talking about global economy</text>
  <text start="283.72" dur="9.05">talking about an international order and</text>
  <text start="287.43" dur="7.84">we see already he&amp;#39;s pushing the idea of</text>
  <text start="292.77" dur="4.44">Russian aggression as he&amp;#39;s giving the</text>
  <text start="295.27" dur="6.88">speech</text>
  <text start="297.21" dur="8.07">and he&amp;#39;s saying that Canada and NATO</text>
  <text start="302.15" dur="6.4">they need to send a solidarity message</text>
  <text start="305.28" dur="9.74">to the rest of the world he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="308.55" dur="10.83">that Russia and their aggressive State</text>
  <text start="315.02" dur="8.799">they need to back down from Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="319.38" dur="6.75">all the countries the allies they need</text>
  <text start="323.819" dur="6.151">to send a strong message of solidarity</text>
  <text start="326.13" dur="8.849">and commitment at the next week&amp;#39;s NATO</text>
  <text start="329.97" dur="7.069">summit he went on to say when nations</text>
  <text start="334.979" dur="4.741">violate international rules and norms</text>
  <text start="337.039" dur="4.841">such as Russia&amp;#39;s aggression against</text>
  <text start="339.72" dur="4.83">Ukraine the United States and Canada</text>
  <text start="341.88" dur="6.409">stand united along with our allies and</text>
  <text start="344.55" dur="6.209">defense of our collective security</text>
  <text start="348.289" dur="7.901">starting to sound like war talk to me</text>
  <text start="350.759" dur="6.481">and this is how it gets started and we</text>
  <text start="356.19" dur="4.68">can see that the United States</text>
  <text start="357.24" dur="5.549">continually uses the idea that Russia is</text>
  <text start="360.87" dur="6.06">being very aggressive they&amp;#39;re invading</text>
  <text start="362.789" dur="6.421">Ukraine they&amp;#39;re in Syria the United</text>
  <text start="366.93" dur="4.079">States flies planes or ships very close</text>
  <text start="369.21" dur="4.049">to theirs and blames it on Russia they</text>
  <text start="371.009" dur="4.621">do the same thing with China they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="373.259" dur="7.921">saying that US diplomats they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="375.63" dur="8.789">harassed by the Russian security service</text>
  <text start="381.18" dur="5.25">and Washington Post even put out an</text>
  <text start="384.419" dur="4.921">article saying that a US diplomat was</text>
  <text start="386.43" dur="5.03">beaten by a Russian security guard and</text>
  <text start="389.34" dur="4.47">this is the way they said I went them</text>
  <text start="391.46" dur="4.209">the Russian Federal Security Service</text>
  <text start="393.81" dur="4.949">guards stationed outside the US Embassy</text>
  <text start="395.669" dur="5.011">in Moscow attacked and beat up a US</text>
  <text start="398.759" dur="5.871">diplomat who was trying to enter the</text>
  <text start="400.68" dur="9.45">compound now what really happened was a</text>
  <text start="404.63" dur="8.86">u.s. spy CIA agent attacked a Russian</text>
  <text start="410.13" dur="5.849">police officer but they turned it around</text>
  <text start="413.49" dur="6">and they put out this story in The</text>
  <text start="415.979" dur="5.521">Washington Post because what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="419.49" dur="5.01">trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="421.5" dur="5.49">the idea that Russia is very aggressive</text>
  <text start="424.5" dur="5.219">they&amp;#39;re not just flying their planes</text>
  <text start="426.99" dur="3.93">close to the u.s. planes they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="429.719" dur="4.801">just selling their ships</text>
  <text start="430.92" dur="5.7">or taking their subs and setting them</text>
  <text start="434.52" dur="3.66">over to the UK which all of this is</text>
  <text start="436.62" dur="4.5">completely fake phony and false because</text>
  <text start="438.18" dur="6.14">they all it&amp;#39;s all been proved that know</text>
  <text start="441.12" dur="6.96">that all of this didn&amp;#39;t happen the u.s.</text>
  <text start="444.32" dur="8.23">flew their planes very close and near</text>
  <text start="448.08" dur="8.82">Russia the UK made up the story about</text>
  <text start="452.55" dur="6.21">Russian subs Russia told them where they</text>
  <text start="456.9" dur="4.74">were going to be actually they were</text>
  <text start="458.76" dur="6.63">selling the sub above the water they</text>
  <text start="461.64" dur="6.96">made it into a big deal they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="465.39" dur="6.26">propaganda and the reason for all of</text>
  <text start="468.6" dur="6.6">this is because they need to get a war</text>
  <text start="471.65" dur="6.25">started they&amp;#39;re trying as hard as they</text>
  <text start="475.2" dur="5.04">possibly can because what&amp;#39;s happening is</text>
  <text start="477.9" dur="4.59">everything is starting to fall apart on</text>
  <text start="480.24" dur="5.49">them remember that Libyan unity</text>
  <text start="482.49" dur="5.67">government that the UN the u.s. the</text>
  <text start="485.73" dur="4.74">coalition forces put together and he</text>
  <text start="488.16" dur="3.5">force it on the people because the</text>
  <text start="490.47" dur="4.14">people didn&amp;#39;t elect for this government</text>
  <text start="491.66" dur="6.34">it was forced upon them and said you</text>
  <text start="494.61" dur="5.28">will accept even though you elected a</text>
  <text start="498" dur="5.16">government no no this is the one we want</text>
  <text start="499.89" dur="7.17">you to have doesn&amp;#39;t sound very</text>
  <text start="503.16" dur="7.26">democratic but something very</text>
  <text start="507.06" dur="6.84">interesting just happened the Libyan</text>
  <text start="510.42" dur="6.09">unity government is falling apart the</text>
  <text start="513.9" dur="5.3">finance minister the Justice Minister</text>
  <text start="516.51" dur="6.18">the national reconciliation Minister</text>
  <text start="519.2" dur="5.74">economy and Industry Minister they all</text>
  <text start="522.69" dur="5.46">submitted their resignation to the</text>
  <text start="524.94" dur="6.06">presidential Council they said they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="528.15" dur="4.68">done so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now in</text>
  <text start="531" dur="4.53">the Middle East things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="532.83" dur="6.3">falling apart the plan they had in Libya</text>
  <text start="535.53" dur="9.78">not doing well the plan they had in Iraq</text>
  <text start="539.13" dur="12.54">Syria Yemen Lebanon not doing well at</text>
  <text start="545.31" dur="9.9">all and as this accelerates so is the</text>
  <text start="551.67" dur="5.52">acceleration for war and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="555.21" dur="4.32">seeing right now is they&amp;#39;re pushing this</text>
  <text start="557.19" dur="4.53">actually in Iraq if you look at Iraq</text>
  <text start="559.53" dur="4.68">right now when the u.s. gets out of the</text>
  <text start="561.72" dur="3.179">way of the Iraqi soldiers guess what</text>
  <text start="564.21" dur="3.119">they have six</text>
  <text start="564.899" dur="5.011">they&amp;#39;re able to push the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="567.329" dur="6.36">out of their country they&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="569.91" dur="8.549">defeat them in fallujah in different</text>
  <text start="573.689" dur="9.63">areas of Iraq but the US for some reason</text>
  <text start="578.459" dur="9.271">is still in Iraq and when you look at</text>
  <text start="583.319" dur="7.231">this we see that the Islamic state they</text>
  <text start="587.73" dur="4.649">only control ten percent of the</text>
  <text start="590.55" dur="3.87">territory in Iraq they used to control</text>
  <text start="592.379" dur="4.111">forty percent the proxy army the United</text>
  <text start="594.42" dur="6.75">States government central bankers so</text>
  <text start="596.49" dur="7.789">what in the world are the troops doing</text>
  <text start="601.17" dur="6">in Iraq and why are more going there</text>
  <text start="604.279" dur="6.43">because it seems that the Iraqi forces</text>
  <text start="607.17" dur="6.899">they have this under control but the</text>
  <text start="610.709" dur="7.17">u.s. they&amp;#39;re loaning Iraq 2.7 billion</text>
  <text start="614.069" dur="5.43">for war equipment the people are rising</text>
  <text start="617.879" dur="3.96">up they don&amp;#39;t want the puppet government</text>
  <text start="619.499" dur="7.051">in place they don&amp;#39;t want the central</text>
  <text start="621.839" dur="9.44">bankers controlling everything and we</text>
  <text start="626.55" dur="6.81">see right now that the us-led coalition</text>
  <text start="631.279" dur="5.081">they&amp;#39;re not even listening to the</text>
  <text start="633.36" dur="5.819">request of the Iraq forces the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="636.36" dur="5.039">forces the Iraqi forces said this is a</text>
  <text start="639.179" dur="5.82">convoy we should hit the United States</text>
  <text start="641.399" dur="8.43">didn&amp;#39;t take them out instead Iraq how to</text>
  <text start="644.999" dur="6.96">do it they&amp;#39;re acting now independently</text>
  <text start="649.829" dur="3.87">of the US forces they&amp;#39;re not relying</text>
  <text start="651.959" dur="5.04">them we&amp;#39;re not they&amp;#39;re not relying on</text>
  <text start="653.699" dur="6.75">them whatsoever and they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="656.999" dur="6.121">realize we don&amp;#39;t need the US forces</text>
  <text start="660.449" dur="6.38">there anymore we can handle this and</text>
  <text start="663.12" dur="7.11">they have been handling it but we know</text>
  <text start="666.829" dur="5.5">something else is going on they want to</text>
  <text start="670.23" dur="7.74">take the Middle East they want to divide</text>
  <text start="672.329" dur="8.341">it up and to do this they need forces in</text>
  <text start="677.97" dur="5.01">the area they need certain things to</text>
  <text start="680.67" dur="6.719">happen and this is what we&amp;#39;re watching</text>
  <text start="682.98" dur="7.68">for now Russia is continually delivering</text>
  <text start="687.389" dur="5.91">humanitarian aid into Syria they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="690.66" dur="5.31">delivered about six metric tons of</text>
  <text start="693.299" dur="4.301">humanitarian aid to the Syrian province</text>
  <text start="695.97" dur="4.45">of Latakia</text>
  <text start="697.6" dur="4.89">and we see right now the u.s.</text>
  <text start="700.42" dur="3.33">continually uses excuses that they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="702.49" dur="4.529">bring any aid in and every time they</text>
  <text start="703.75" dur="4.949">bring a tin guess what its weapons they</text>
  <text start="707.019" dur="4.471">supply them to the Islamic state elders</text>
  <text start="708.699" dur="5.461">for al Qaeda moderate rebels and we see</text>
  <text start="711.49" dur="7.05">that Russia is truly bringing in aid to</text>
  <text start="714.16" dur="7.65">help the people Assange forces the Assad</text>
  <text start="718.54" dur="7.169">government is allowing the UN aid to</text>
  <text start="721.81" dur="5.79">come into the country and we need to</text>
  <text start="725.709" dur="7.32">remember something very important here</text>
  <text start="727.6" dur="8.01">that the u.s. at this point they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="733.029" dur="5.281">care about the people inside of Syria</text>
  <text start="735.61" dur="5.64">because this is quite evident the</text>
  <text start="738.31" dur="4.86">moderate rebels the terrorists have been</text>
  <text start="741.25" dur="4.41">doing horrific things to the people</text>
  <text start="743.17" dur="7.109">they&amp;#39;ve been using sarin gas chlorine</text>
  <text start="745.66" dur="6.09">mustard gas and they&amp;#39;ve been using it on</text>
  <text start="750.279" dur="3.661">the people of Syria I know they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="751.75" dur="4.5">blaming it on Assad but we have evidence</text>
  <text start="753.94" dur="4.259">that it was the terrorists it was the</text>
  <text start="756.25" dur="5.73">moderate rebels and the evidence</text>
  <text start="758.199" dur="7.38">continually presents itself and this</text>
  <text start="761.98" dur="6.029">shows us that the u.s. they never really</text>
  <text start="765.579" dur="4.801">do care about the people because once</text>
  <text start="768.009" dur="6.45">they get their way anyone that opposes</text>
  <text start="770.38" dur="7.649">them they are the terrorists now we see</text>
  <text start="774.459" dur="7.86">that Turkey has identified the airport</text>
  <text start="778.029" dur="8.31">bombers they were Russian and we see</text>
  <text start="782.319" dur="8.731">right now that this is being used for a</text>
  <text start="786.339" dur="7.531">specific purpose because we see us NATO</text>
  <text start="791.05" dur="5.219">they are sending Patriot anti-ballistic</text>
  <text start="793.87" dur="4.529">missile interceptor batteries to turkey</text>
  <text start="796.269" dur="5.341">of course it has no military</text>
  <text start="798.399" dur="6.601">justification and maybe in preparation</text>
  <text start="801.61" dur="8.099">for a manufactured incident to provoke a</text>
  <text start="805" dur="6.6">new crisis and we say that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="809.709" dur="3.75">already given the high Mars missile</text>
  <text start="811.6" dur="4.5">system we know they&amp;#39;ve been building a</text>
  <text start="813.459" dur="4.471">wall we know the security has been</text>
  <text start="816.1" dur="4.77">improved by Department of Homeland</text>
  <text start="817.93" dur="4.829">Security and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="820.87" dur="4.73">this Airport attack is giving turkey</text>
  <text start="822.759" dur="7.2">incentive to battle the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="825.6" dur="5.83">now as the United States decided okay we</text>
  <text start="829.959" dur="4.38">can&amp;#39;t save unit the</text>
  <text start="831.43" dur="5.58">sonicstate inside of Syria so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="834.339" dur="6.091">changing course we should all go after</text>
  <text start="837.01" dur="5.91">the Islamic state because if we notice</text>
  <text start="840.43" dur="6.03">at this point that the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="842.92" dur="5.34">protecting al Qaeda al-nusrah and the</text>
  <text start="846.46" dur="4.95">moderate rebels which is all one in the</text>
  <text start="848.26" dur="5.87">same they airlifted a lot of the Islamic</text>
  <text start="851.41" dur="8.94">state out of Syria and brought them to</text>
  <text start="854.13" dur="9.01">Libya but we see right now that things</text>
  <text start="860.35" dur="5.609">are starting to heat up we&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="863.14" dur="4.62">towards that August first date where we</text>
  <text start="865.959" dur="4.201">know in August they&amp;#39;re supposed to be</text>
  <text start="867.76" dur="5.04">some type of transitional government we</text>
  <text start="870.16" dur="5.25">know Assad is not going to step down we</text>
  <text start="872.8" dur="5.28">know that Russia and Syria has said we</text>
  <text start="875.41" dur="4.23">should let the people decide if Assad</text>
  <text start="878.08" dur="2.94">should stay or go now are we going to</text>
  <text start="879.64" dur="5.42">have elections on august first most</text>
  <text start="881.02" dur="7.67">likely not but the u.s. they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="885.06" dur="9.219">for assads removal that&amp;#39;s their goal</text>
  <text start="888.69" dur="7.6">period so Obama he came out with</text>
  <text start="894.279" dur="5.641">something very interesting he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="896.29" dur="6.6">proposing a pact with Russia to</text>
  <text start="899.92" dur="6.48">strengthen military cooperation in Syria</text>
  <text start="902.89" dur="8.13">well let me say Russia was invited by</text>
  <text start="906.4" dur="7.92">the elected president in a sovereign</text>
  <text start="911.02" dur="6.63">country and the US and the coalition</text>
  <text start="914.32" dur="6.54">forces are invading that country okay</text>
  <text start="917.65" dur="5.91">but let&amp;#39;s go with it he&amp;#39;s saying to</text>
  <text start="920.86" dur="5.099">Russia that they should create this</text>
  <text start="923.56" dur="4.92">partnership and strengthen cooperation</text>
  <text start="925.959" dur="8.491">between the two nations in the fight</text>
  <text start="928.48" dur="7.68">against terrorist groups in Syria now he</text>
  <text start="934.45" dur="4.889">sent the proposal to the Russian</text>
  <text start="936.16" dur="4.89">government and the United States is</text>
  <text start="939.339" dur="4.641">promising to work with russian air force</text>
  <text start="941.05" dur="6.75">in coordinating targeting embalming</text>
  <text start="943.98" dur="8.14">al-nusrah al-qaeda and any other</text>
  <text start="947.8" dur="7.38">terrorist organization in exchange for</text>
  <text start="952.12" dur="5.73">Russia convincing Assad to halt his</text>
  <text start="955.18" dur="7.92">bombing campaign against us supported</text>
  <text start="957.85" dur="6.98">rebels there&amp;#39;s one problem here they</text>
  <text start="963.1" dur="4.61">keep saying they can&amp;#39;t set</text>
  <text start="964.83" dur="8.01">rate al-nusrah and the moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="967.71" dur="7.08">they&amp;#39;re too intertwined and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="972.84" dur="6.65">saying if they do make this and they go</text>
  <text start="974.79" dur="6.63">ahead and they bomb moderate rebels well</text>
  <text start="979.49" dur="4.12">they&amp;#39;re going to have to take this to</text>
  <text start="981.42" dur="3.99">the next level now of course what</text>
  <text start="983.61" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re trying to do here because we</text>
  <text start="985.41" dur="4.44">know they&amp;#39;re intertwined they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="987.6" dur="3.33">to save al-nusrah and al-qaeda because</text>
  <text start="989.85" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;ll say the moderate rebels are</text>
  <text start="990.93" dur="7.56">right there you camp on this area so is</text>
  <text start="994.32" dur="11.1">this really a true proposal in joining</text>
  <text start="998.49" dur="12.12">with Russia no this is another scheme to</text>
  <text start="1005.42" dur="8.01">get Assad and Russia to stop bombing</text>
  <text start="1010.61" dur="4.59">there are proxy armies plain and simple</text>
  <text start="1013.43" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;re doing right here</text>
  <text start="1015.2" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re buying time once again and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1018.62" dur="7.02">starting to see that they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1020.99" dur="8.37">push this idea as we get closer and</text>
  <text start="1025.64" dur="5.43">closer to August first now does that</text>
  <text start="1029.36" dur="5.43">mean something&amp;#39;s going to happen on that</text>
  <text start="1031.07" dur="5.01">date it might it might not maybe it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1034.79" dur="3.93">happen in the middle of August we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1036.08" dur="4.129">know but this is what we need to watch</text>
  <text start="1038.72" dur="3.96">because we&amp;#39;re looking at all these</text>
  <text start="1040.209" dur="5.231">geopolitical indicators and they are</text>
  <text start="1042.68" dur="5.97">definitely pointing to something</text>
  <text start="1045.44" dur="5.79">happening in this time frame something</text>
  <text start="1048.65" dur="6.99">might change maybe putin will come up</text>
  <text start="1051.23" dur="6.3">with some other type of plan and say</text>
  <text start="1055.64" dur="5.4">okay we&amp;#39;ll take part of your proposal</text>
  <text start="1057.53" dur="4.86">Obama and we&amp;#39;ll also do this but we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1061.04" dur="3.56">have to wait and see because we can see</text>
  <text start="1062.39" dur="7.14">right now Putin is on the other end and</text>
  <text start="1064.6" dur="9.19">he is trying to stop a war he&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="1069.53" dur="7.59">to calm the situation down trying to get</text>
  <text start="1073.79" dur="7.62">rid of the terrorists inside of Syria</text>
  <text start="1077.12" dur="6.87">and we know the coalition forces the US</text>
  <text start="1081.41" dur="4.08">forces they&amp;#39;re not there to get rid of</text>
  <text start="1083.99" dur="4.26">the terrorists are there to support the</text>
  <text start="1085.49" dur="5.22">terrorists but we can see that many</text>
  <text start="1088.25" dur="4.2">things are already in place they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1090.71" dur="4.65">training the moderate rebels to call in</text>
  <text start="1092.45" dur="4.89">airstrikes we know the French the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1095.36" dur="2.88">they&amp;#39;ve been building air bases we know</text>
  <text start="1097.34" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re special</text>
  <text start="1098.24" dur="5.4">teams are on the ground we know that</text>
  <text start="1100.97" dur="5.91">turkey has gotten Patriot missile</text>
  <text start="1103.64" dur="7.56">batteries once again they have the high</text>
  <text start="1106.88" dur="6">more missile system we know that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1111.2" dur="4.62">been building a wall they set up</text>
  <text start="1112.88" dur="5.22">security travel advisories all over the</text>
  <text start="1115.82" dur="4.02">place we know there was another false</text>
  <text start="1118.1" dur="6.15">flag to say hey let&amp;#39;s go after the</text>
  <text start="1119.84" dur="6.6">Islamic state we know there are warships</text>
  <text start="1124.25" dur="5.88">already in the Mediterranean standing by</text>
  <text start="1126.44" dur="5.18">and we know the Islamic state they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1130.13" dur="4.08">been losing ground they&amp;#39;re beaten</text>
  <text start="1131.62" dur="5.92">they&amp;#39;re only have ten percent of Iraq</text>
  <text start="1134.21" dur="5.82">right now Syria they&amp;#39;re being pushed</text>
  <text start="1137.54" dur="5.82">further and further out of the country</text>
  <text start="1140.03" dur="6.69">and the u.s. is backed into a corner</text>
  <text start="1143.36" dur="4.77">they need to save their moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="1146.72" dur="2.73">they need to save L knows where they</text>
  <text start="1148.13" dur="3.99">need to save al Qaeda that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="1149.45" dur="4.95">have left right now and they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1152.12" dur="5.46">whatever they possibly can and as we</text>
  <text start="1154.4" dur="8.88">know this economy is deteriorating very</text>
  <text start="1157.58" dur="8.3">very quickly and as we go through this</text>
  <text start="1163.28" dur="6.35">summer we&amp;#39;re going to see things</text>
  <text start="1165.88" dur="7.09">accelerate we&amp;#39;re already seeing it and</text>
  <text start="1169.63" dur="6.91">there&amp;#39;s more on the way because they</text>
  <text start="1172.97" dur="6.66">need to convince the world it is time to</text>
  <text start="1176.54" dur="7.019">go to war and this is why we can expect</text>
  <text start="1179.63" dur="6.54">an event another one most likely another</text>
  <text start="1183.559" dur="5.851">one after that until we get to the main</text>
  <text start="1186.17" dur="6.509">one where they bring everyone into war</text>
  <text start="1189.41" dur="4.68">and we need to continually watch this</text>
  <text start="1192.679" dur="4.341">and this is why I continually say</text>
  <text start="1194.09" dur="6.3">everyone needs to be prepared and ready</text>
  <text start="1197.02" dur="7.09">you need to have a weapon you need to</text>
  <text start="1200.39" dur="6.26">have food you need to have cash on hand</text>
  <text start="1204.11" dur="4.8">you need to have gold and silver and</text>
  <text start="1206.65" dur="4.36">eventually a home I hope there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1208.91" dur="3.81">to be a time and place where all of us</text>
  <text start="1211.01" dur="4.95">can band together and say you know what</text>
  <text start="1212.72" dur="6.63">let&amp;#39;s go march on Washington and say we</text>
  <text start="1215.96" dur="5.49">are not going to war we need tens of</text>
  <text start="1219.35" dur="4.95">billions of people out there at the</text>
  <text start="1221.45" dur="7.74">front door of the White House to say no</text>
  <text start="1224.3" dur="7.11">it&amp;#39;s time for you to step down so</text>
  <text start="1229.19" dur="3.6">continue to prepare</text>
  <text start="1231.41" dur="4.52">get ready because when the collapse</text>
  <text start="1232.79" dur="6.84">comes they will not be able to stop it</text>
  <text start="1235.93" dur="7.06">war is just going to mask of what really</text>
  <text start="1239.63" dur="6.69">happening here food supplies are going</text>
  <text start="1242.99" dur="9.05">to dry up deliveries most likely are</text>
  <text start="1246.32" dur="8.01">going to stop or slow dramatically and</text>
  <text start="1252.04" dur="6.43">it&amp;#39;s going to be very difficult to feed</text>
  <text start="1254.33" dur="6.96">your family to give them water to get</text>
  <text start="1258.47" dur="6">medical supplies to protect your family</text>
  <text start="1261.29" dur="5.85">from those who would who need supplies</text>
  <text start="1264.47" dur="6.84">or will do harm to get those supplies</text>
  <text start="1267.14" dur="8.15">and we can see looking at other</text>
  <text start="1271.31" dur="8.01">countries that yes this does happen and</text>
  <text start="1275.29" dur="5.86">it will happen here it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like</text>

  <text start="1288.53" dur="4.16">situation like this we&amp;#39;ve never been in</text>
  <text start="1290.63" dur="5.85">a situation where there&amp;#39;s so much debt</text>
  <text start="1292.69" dur="5.68">the u.s. is provoking war all over the</text>
  <text start="1296.48" dur="6.39">place they&amp;#39;re telling us if we believe</text>
  <text start="1298.37" dur="7.62">their story there&amp;#39;s terrorism I mean if</text>
