  <text start="62.66" dur="4.72">2017 and the plot of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.06" dur="5.2">multiple warnings broadcasted is</text>
  <text start="67.38" dur="4.739">something being planned let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="70.26" dur="5.1">the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="72.119" dur="7.381">geopolitical news now while Obama was</text>
  <text start="75.36" dur="7.2">president he implemented a huge amount</text>
  <text start="79.5" dur="5.85">of regulations and what Trump has been</text>
  <text start="82.56" dur="5.449">doing he&amp;#39;s eliminating many of the</text>
  <text start="85.35" dur="5.519">regulations that were put forth by Obama</text>
  <text start="88.009" dur="4.271">16 regs removed for every new rule that</text>
  <text start="90.869" dur="4.831">was introduced the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="92.28" dur="5.1">has stopped over 800 regulations</text>
  <text start="95.7" dur="4.559">proposed under the former President</text>
  <text start="97.38" dur="4.83">Obama and we see that Trump also halted</text>
  <text start="100.259" dur="3.691">about 181 billion worth of Obama</text>
  <text start="102.21" dur="4.049">administration regulations on his first</text>

  <text start="107.369" dur="4.411">additionally the administration and</text>
  <text start="109.229" dur="4.5">Congress have saved at least 60 billion</text>
  <text start="111.78" dur="4.41">in regulatory costs by rolling back</text>
  <text start="113.729" dur="5.371">Obama rules through the Congressional</text>
  <text start="116.19" dur="4.98">review act so we can see there are</text>
  <text start="119.1" dur="3.78">things that are being done but the</text>
  <text start="121.17" dur="3.559">corporate media really doesn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="122.88" dur="5.099">report on this now we see that Mueller</text>
  <text start="124.729" dur="6.01">he is going after Trump he&amp;#39;s going after</text>
  <text start="127.979" dur="5.971">his personal finances and Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="130.739" dur="7.351">lawyers and aides well they are scouring</text>

  <text start="138.09" dur="5.85">all the investigators hired by Robert S</text>
  <text start="141.239" dur="4.801">Mueller they&amp;#39;re looking for conflict of</text>
  <text start="143.94" dur="4.799">interests they could use to discredit</text>
  <text start="146.04" dur="6.63">the investigation and maybe to have</text>
  <text start="148.739" dur="6.601">Mueller removed or have individuals</text>
  <text start="152.67" dur="5.4">removed from his team now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="155.34" dur="4.619">looking at this saying well let&amp;#39;s take a</text>
  <text start="158.07" dur="4.71">look at each individual and see if</text>
  <text start="159.959" dur="4.831">they&amp;#39;ve given any type of donation to</text>
  <text start="162.78" dur="4.35">the Clinton campaign because this is</text>
  <text start="164.79" dur="4.35">kind of a conflict of interest and if</text>
  <text start="167.13" dur="4.71">most of his team is made up of these</text>
  <text start="169.14" dur="4.98">individuals then we have a major major</text>
  <text start="171.84" dur="4.32">problem here so they&amp;#39;re looking at these</text>
  <text start="174.12" dur="5.01">individuals and the first one is Michael</text>

  <text start="234.39" dur="4.62">knew this was going to happen they</text>

  <text start="239.01" dur="3.87">certain slots they brought them on they</text>
  <text start="240.93" dur="4.68">brought Mueller on because what they</text>
  <text start="242.88" dur="5.34">really want is they&amp;#39;re trying to remove</text>
  <text start="245.61" dur="4.2">Trump any way possible now why do they</text>
  <text start="248.22" dur="4.74">want to do this because what is</text>
  <text start="249.81" dur="5.58">happening right now is that everything</text>
  <text start="252.96" dur="6.089">that they set up over the years for</text>
  <text start="255.39" dur="7.38">globalism to maintain control to push us</text>

  <text start="317.22" dur="3.54">receiving those documents in about three</text>
  <text start="319.56" dur="3.27">months or so</text>
  <text start="320.76" dur="4.77">and once again I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="322.83" dur="5.79">publish them show what these documents</text>
  <text start="325.53" dur="5.22">actually are and what they implicate and</text>
  <text start="328.62" dur="4.53">we&amp;#39;ll have to wait to see how that turns</text>
  <text start="330.75" dur="4.71">out now we talked about this before how</text>
  <text start="333.15" dur="5.49">the corporate media is out there telling</text>
  <text start="335.46" dur="5.16">us how bad North Korea is and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="338.64" dur="5.28">getting information that North Korea&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="340.62" dur="5.46">economy well they&amp;#39;re showing record high</text>
  <text start="343.92" dur="5.37">growth even though there are sanctions</text>
  <text start="346.08" dur="4.65">placed on their economy now we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="349.29" dur="4.14">this in many countries where these</text>
  <text start="350.73" dur="4.14">sanctions they really don&amp;#39;t work the way</text>
  <text start="353.43" dur="3.8">they&amp;#39;re supposed to because again these</text>
  <text start="354.87" dur="5.52">countries look for different ways to</text>
  <text start="357.23" dur="5.41">keep their economy flow to keep the</text>
  <text start="360.39" dur="3.74">system going and they use barter they</text>
  <text start="362.64" dur="4.14">work with countries they use other</text>
  <text start="364.13" dur="5.98">currency they might use gold or silver</text>
  <text start="366.78" dur="4.83">or they might turn to drug trafficking I</text>
  <text start="370.11" dur="3.3">mean this is what happens in these</text>
  <text start="371.61" dur="3.9">countries this is what they do and it</text>
  <text start="373.41" dur="4.2">looks like North Korea has turned to</text>
  <text start="375.51" dur="3.81">drug trafficking and this is one of the</text>
  <text start="377.61" dur="3.93">reasons why the CIA wants to get into</text>
  <text start="379.32" dur="4.62">that country because that&amp;#39;s competition</text>
  <text start="381.54" dur="4.26">because they&amp;#39;re also involved in drug</text>
  <text start="383.94" dur="5.88">trafficking but we see right now that</text>
  <text start="385.8" dur="7.35">they&amp;#39;re their economy well it is</text>
  <text start="389.82" dur="5.28">increased by 3.9 percent in 2016 now</text>
  <text start="393.15" dur="5.82">this is according to the South Koreans</text>
  <text start="395.1" dur="5.46">Bank of Korea they monitor North Korea</text>
  <text start="398.97" dur="3.6">North Korea really doesn&amp;#39;t put out any</text>
  <text start="400.56" dur="4.17">of this information they look at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="402.57" dur="3.48">going on there and they put this</text>
  <text start="404.73" dur="3.84">information out there and the</text>
  <text start="406.05" dur="5.61">information is gathered by the South</text>
  <text start="408.57" dur="5.61">Korean intelligence services now it</text>
  <text start="411.66" dur="4.59">looks like coming out of the BBC there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="414.18" dur="4.32">this warning that is urging all</text>
  <text start="416.25" dur="6.27">nationals in North Korea to depart</text>
  <text start="418.5" dur="7.8">immediately now what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="422.52" dur="6.27">that all u.s. nationals that travel to</text>
  <text start="426.3" dur="4.77">North Korea will have their passports</text>
  <text start="428.79" dur="4.65">invalidated by their government the ban</text>
  <text start="431.07" dur="6.87">comes one month after US student otto</text>
  <text start="433.44" dur="7.95">warmbier died now when you look on the</text>
  <text start="437.94" dur="7.23">u.s. website they only have a warning</text>
  <text start="441.39" dur="6.21">back in May and it looks like this is</text>
  <text start="445.17" dur="4.35">just another warning and I don&amp;#39;t see a</text>
  <text start="447.6" dur="3.99">new one that is out there as of yet but</text>
  <text start="449.52" dur="4.38">the BBC is out there trying to make</text>
  <text start="451.59" dur="2.96">everyone believe that something is about</text>
  <text start="453.9" dur="3.29">to happen</text>
  <text start="454.55" dur="4.74">and they&amp;#39;re telling people not to go to</text>
  <text start="457.19" dur="3.36">North Korea don&amp;#39;t travel to North Korea</text>
  <text start="459.29" dur="3.42">now of course there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="460.55" dur="4.98">problem for Dennis Rodman but we see</text>
  <text start="462.71" dur="6.75">right now that this might be a sign that</text>
  <text start="465.53" dur="5.46">the deep state maybe they&amp;#39;re planning to</text>
  <text start="469.46" dur="3.66">do something there because we have a</text>
  <text start="470.99" dur="5.1">couple of warnings here we have one in</text>
  <text start="473.12" dur="6.42">Jordan where&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a travel warning we</text>
  <text start="476.09" dur="5.52">see the BBC is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="479.54" dur="3.57">warning people about North Korea now the</text>
  <text start="481.61" dur="3.69">United States didn&amp;#39;t officially come out</text>
  <text start="483.11" dur="4.29">and say this they did back in May but</text>
  <text start="485.3" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s no other warning up to this</text>
  <text start="487.4" dur="4.38">point not in July maybe they&amp;#39;ll issue it</text>
  <text start="489.8" dur="4.14">a day or two from now but it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="491.78" dur="5.97">strange that the BBC has it way before</text>
  <text start="493.94" dur="5.79">the US does which tells me that maybe</text>
  <text start="497.75" dur="4.02">this isn&amp;#39;t coming from the US maybe this</text>
  <text start="499.73" dur="4.23">is coming from the deep State and they</text>
  <text start="501.77" dur="3.33">just put this out there in the corporate</text>
  <text start="503.96" dur="2.73">media because when people see this in</text>
  <text start="505.1" dur="3.84">the corporate media they just think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.69" dur="4.5">coming from the US now they might be</text>
  <text start="508.94" dur="4.53">ready to do something but Lavrov is out</text>
  <text start="511.19" dur="5.22">there and he is saying listen Russia</text>
  <text start="513.47" dur="5.43">does not believe in regime change</text>
  <text start="516.41" dur="4.35">anywhere in the world especially in</text>
  <text start="518.9" dur="3.6">North Korea so it looks like the</text>
  <text start="520.76" dur="3.78">Russians are out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="522.5" dur="5.4">saying listen if you&amp;#39;re planning any</text>
  <text start="524.54" dur="5.85">type of regime change think twice we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="527.9" dur="5.1">still working out the details with North</text>
  <text start="530.39" dur="5.82">Korea and China we&amp;#39;re trying to solve</text>
  <text start="533" dur="6.84">this situation so they must have some</text>
  <text start="536.21" dur="6.72">idea that something is planned and is in</text>
  <text start="539.84" dur="5.57">the works and we need to remember we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="542.93" dur="5.67">coming up to August where normally</text>
  <text start="545.41" dur="6.55">Congress goes on break and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="548.6" dur="4.74">come back until after Labor Day so we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="551.96" dur="3.57">have to see how this whole thing plays</text>
  <text start="553.34" dur="4.17">out because this is normally when the</text>
  <text start="555.53" dur="4.92">deep state likes to work this is when</text>
  <text start="557.51" dur="6.6">they like to do things now Trump is out</text>
  <text start="560.45" dur="5.49">there and he is saying that you know we</text>
  <text start="564.11" dur="4.83">might not be sending any troops to</text>
  <text start="565.94" dur="6.21">Afghanistan he wants to hold off right</text>
  <text start="568.94" dur="4.95">now because he&amp;#39;s saying that the Islamic</text>
  <text start="572.15" dur="4.5">state is almost done and finished with</text>
  <text start="573.89" dur="4.86">and maybe right now we don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="576.65" dur="5.37">send any troops into Afghanistan so all</text>
  <text start="578.75" dur="6.81">that talk of 5,000 50,000 troops that</text>
  <text start="582.02" dur="5.49">seems to be disappearing right now now</text>
  <text start="585.56" dur="2.76">Lavrov is out there and he&amp;#39;s striking</text>
  <text start="587.51" dur="4.56">back</text>
  <text start="588.32" dur="8.34">at the cia&amp;#39;s Pompeo and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="592.07" dur="7.95">listen russia has the legal basis to be</text>
  <text start="596.66" dur="7.17">in Syria we don&amp;#39;t hide our bases we have</text>
  <text start="600.02" dur="6.93">two bases in there and the Syrian</text>
  <text start="603.83" dur="5.76">government invited us in we set up bases</text>
  <text start="606.95" dur="7.07">we&amp;#39;re very open about it compared to the</text>
  <text start="609.59" dur="7.92">US where the US is in Syria illegally</text>
  <text start="614.02" dur="5.47">hiding the bases now remembered Turkey</text>
  <text start="617.51" dur="4.82">their news agency came out and they</text>
  <text start="619.49" dur="6.15">exposed the bases in Syria and this was</text>
  <text start="622.33" dur="6.91">completely done on purpose because what</text>
  <text start="625.64" dur="6.63">does this do it exposes what the US was</text>
  <text start="629.24" dur="5.46">planning to do and what they&amp;#39;re doing by</text>
  <text start="632.27" dur="4.92">building these bases this is why this</text>
  <text start="634.7" dur="5.16">was done this was a way to shake</text>
  <text start="637.19" dur="5.4">everything up remember the deep state</text>
  <text start="639.86" dur="5.25">was trying to create this separate</text>
  <text start="642.59" dur="4.65">entity inside of Syria and then it was</text>
  <text start="645.11" dur="3.6">going to be run by the Kurds and this is</text>
  <text start="647.24" dur="2.91">why they were setting up all these bases</text>
  <text start="648.71" dur="3.42">this is why they don&amp;#39;t care about the</text>
  <text start="650.15" dur="3.36">moderate rebels this is why the Islamic</text>
  <text start="652.13" dur="3.03">state they don&amp;#39;t care about any more al</text>
  <text start="653.51" dur="3.57">Qaeda anymore because they knew they</text>
  <text start="655.16" dur="3.6">were beat there isn&amp;#39;t they knew there</text>
  <text start="657.08" dur="5.07">was nothing else they can do and this is</text>
  <text start="658.76" dur="5.55">Plan B for them and the moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="662.15" dur="5.1">they don&amp;#39;t know what to do at this point</text>
