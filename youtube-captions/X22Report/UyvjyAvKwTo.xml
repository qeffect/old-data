  <text start="37.94" dur="4.5">seventh 2015 and the thought of this</text>
  <text start="40.43" dur="4.769">episode is the current economic collapse</text>
  <text start="42.44" dur="5.189">news brief let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="45.199" dur="4.89">economic collapse news now we have been</text>
  <text start="47.629" dur="4.5">seeing the economy imploding on itself</text>
  <text start="50.089" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re going to do whatever they need</text>
  <text start="52.129" dur="4.291">to do to keep this system propped up</text>
  <text start="54.589" dur="4.021">because they don&amp;#39;t want this falling and</text>
  <text start="56.42" dur="4.279">crashing on its own they want it to be</text>
  <text start="58.61" dur="4.35">controlled they want to control it and</text>
  <text start="60.699" dur="6.941">they will do whatever they have to to</text>
  <text start="62.96" dur="6.06">keep all bubbles inflated and we just</text>
  <text start="67.64" dur="3.96">saw the unemployment numbers come out</text>
  <text start="69.02" dur="4.92">and basically those are fake phony and</text>
  <text start="71.6" dur="5.939">false they drop them to five percent</text>
  <text start="73.94" dur="6.51">they threw a lot more people off the</text>
  <text start="77.539" dur="6.091">list of those looking to get a job and</text>
  <text start="80.45" dur="5.459">remember the way it works is if you</text>
  <text start="83.63" dur="5.4">haven&amp;#39;t been on an interview in the last</text>
  <text start="85.909" dur="6.421">four weeks guess what they feel that you</text>
  <text start="89.03" dur="6.619">no longer want a job if you go from a</text>
  <text start="92.33" dur="6.12">full-time 80 70 80 90</text>
  <text start="95.649" dur="5.22">hundred-thousand-dollar job and now</text>
  <text start="98.45" dur="5.94">you&amp;#39;re working two three part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="100.869" dur="7.36">you have two or three jobs you lost the</text>
  <text start="104.39" dur="6.42">one but you gained one two three port</text>
  <text start="108.229" dur="6.271">time jobs and this is how they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="110.81" dur="5.58">manipulating all these numbers and we</text>
  <text start="114.5" dur="3.24">realize they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating the</text>
  <text start="116.39" dur="3.63">stock market they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating</text>
  <text start="117.74" dur="3.87">the precious metals and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="120.02" dur="4.98">manipulating all the other statistical</text>
  <text start="121.61" dur="6.929">information now there are different ways</text>
  <text start="125" dur="5.13">they can manipulate like for example the</text>
  <text start="128.539" dur="5.121">report just came out that the latest</text>
  <text start="130.13" dur="7.41">consumer credit data for September was</text>
  <text start="133.66" dur="5.56">doing incredibly well its surged to 28</text>
  <text start="137.54" dur="5.25">point nine billion and when I hear this</text>
  <text start="139.22" dur="7.019">where consumer credit is increasing I</text>
  <text start="142.79" dur="5.729">just feel and I say to myself people are</text>
  <text start="146.239" dur="3.87">just taking on more and more dead this</text>
  <text start="148.519" dur="4.291">is not a good thing either through</text>
  <text start="150.109" dur="6.6">credit cards student loans or automobile</text>
  <text start="152.81" dur="6.6">loans or even homes but they don&amp;#39;t count</text>
  <text start="156.709" dur="4.951">homes really in this so when we look at</text>
  <text start="159.41" dur="5.04">this they&amp;#39;re trying to make us feel that</text>
  <text start="161.66" dur="6.54">this is a good thing but this is</text>
  <text start="164.45" dur="6.899">more debt on the people and they were</text>
  <text start="168.2" dur="5.58">expecting that this was only going to be</text>
  <text start="171.349" dur="5.521">an 18 billion dollar rise and all of a</text>
  <text start="173.78" dur="4.65">sudden the surge of credit was twenty</text>
  <text start="176.87" dur="5.25">eight point nine billion now this is</text>
  <text start="178.43" dur="6.75">great for the central bankers and the</text>
  <text start="182.12" dur="4.619">bankers it&amp;#39;s fantastic for them but for</text>
  <text start="185.18" dur="3.33">the people not so much because that</text>
  <text start="186.739" dur="4.47">means they need to take out more loans</text>
  <text start="188.51" dur="5.729">to do things where normally they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="191.209" dur="6.871">have the money to pay this back but when</text>
  <text start="194.239" dur="5.821">we look at this closely we see there</text>
  <text start="198.08" dur="3.269">wasn&amp;#39;t that much in the non revolving</text>
  <text start="200.06" dur="3.179">credit which is credit cards and things</text>
  <text start="201.349" dur="4.831">like that and I think a lot of people</text>
  <text start="203.239" dur="4.621">are tapped out at this point and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="206.18" dur="4.77">just trying to get by with what cash</text>
  <text start="207.86" dur="5.879">they have I mean fuel prices have come</text>
  <text start="210.95" dur="4.92">down people are saying you know</text>
  <text start="213.739" dur="4.891">something I&amp;#39;m going to use that whatever</text>
  <text start="215.87" dur="4.92">extra there is on food instead of</text>
  <text start="218.63" dur="4.71">charging it to my credit card my credit</text>
  <text start="220.79" dur="4.529">cards are already maxed out those people</text>
  <text start="223.34" dur="4.739">who are losing jobs they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="225.319" dur="6.39">out and spending so when we look at this</text>
  <text start="228.079" dur="7.171">we see that student and car loans sword</text>
  <text start="231.709" dur="6.291">by twenty two point two billion now this</text>
  <text start="235.25" dur="8.639">was the biggest monthly jump on record</text>
  <text start="238" dur="10.239">but when you look closely at this where</text>
  <text start="243.889" dur="8.761">did all this come from it was the US</text>
  <text start="248.239" dur="8.99">government directly funding the biggest</text>
  <text start="252.65" dur="9.75">student and card debt bubble in history</text>
  <text start="257.229" dur="10.091">the government purchasing huge amounts</text>
  <text start="262.4" dur="8.34">of automobiles I mean this is how they</text>
  <text start="267.32" dur="5.43">manipulate the number so this credit</text>
  <text start="270.74" dur="5.73">surge wasn&amp;#39;t because people were like oh</text>
  <text start="272.75" dur="6.75">I have more money I have a better job</text>
  <text start="276.47" dur="6.87">now I just got a job and let me go out</text>
  <text start="279.5" dur="7.38">and buy a new car because as we know the</text>
  <text start="283.34" dur="5.49">unemployment numbers aren&amp;#39;t real that</text>
  <text start="286.88" dur="3.69">the government is giving us we know</text>
  <text start="288.83" dur="5.24">there are more and more people being</text>
  <text start="290.57" dur="6.12">laid off but to keep the illusion alive</text>
  <text start="294.07" dur="4.19">they need to show that this economy is</text>
  <text start="296.69" dur="4.62">strong so</text>
  <text start="298.26" dur="6.32">all they did was inflate this bubble</text>
  <text start="301.31" dur="6.55">further now this is in the billions</text>
  <text start="304.58" dur="5.19">starting back around two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="4.05">when we have the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="309.77" dur="6.09">consumer loans owned by the federal</text>
  <text start="311.91" dur="12.35">government was around a hundred billion</text>
  <text start="315.86" dur="14.02">now since that time it has grown to 925</text>
  <text start="324.26" dur="9.25">billion dollars it&amp;#39;s another bubble all</text>
  <text start="329.88" dur="6.65">of this is a bubble student loans auto</text>
  <text start="333.51" dur="7.59">loans Treasury bonds stock market</text>
  <text start="336.53" dur="7.06">derivatives all created by the central</text>
  <text start="341.1" dur="5.42">bank the American people are sitting on</text>
  <text start="343.59" dur="6.69">the sidelines the central bank is</text>
  <text start="346.52" dur="6.22">creating this economy giving us this</text>
  <text start="350.28" dur="6.21">illusion that the people of the country</text>
  <text start="352.74" dur="6.39">are supporting this and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="356.49" dur="5.31">to convince everyone this is why the</text>
  <text start="359.13" dur="4.47">economy is doing well but when you look</text>
  <text start="361.8" dur="3.81">through all of this junk they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="363.6" dur="4.62">throwing at us it&amp;#39;s really the</text>
  <text start="365.61" dur="6.69">government the central bank that is</text>
  <text start="368.22" dur="8.49">continually spending as much as they</text>
  <text start="372.3" dur="8.1">possibly can to keep this economy where</text>
  <text start="376.71" dur="6.21">it is the people are being laid off the</text>
  <text start="380.4" dur="5.22">people don&amp;#39;t have the money the people</text>
  <text start="382.92" dur="4.95">are not taking out mortgages they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="385.62" dur="4.11">taking out the auto loans at the central</text>
  <text start="387.87" dur="4.56">bank&amp;#39;s want them to take out the student</text>
  <text start="389.73" dur="6.48">loans that they want them to take out so</text>
  <text start="392.43" dur="8.16">the government steps in and picks up the</text>
  <text start="396.21" dur="7.65">difference to push these bubbles larger</text>
  <text start="400.59" dur="6.69">and larger now we know Obamacare is out</text>
  <text start="403.86" dur="5.52">there to basically help the government</text>
  <text start="407.28" dur="4.86">out with all the revenue that they need</text>
  <text start="409.38" dur="6.14">to bring in because they know from the</text>
  <text start="412.14" dur="6.06">people working this revenue is slowly</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="4.69">dying because as more and more people</text>
  <text start="418.2" dur="5.07">get laid off they&amp;#39;re taking these high</text>
  <text start="420.21" dur="4.5">paying jobs not getting a job or just</text>
  <text start="423.27" dur="3.48">getting a part-time job so that means</text>
  <text start="424.71" dur="6.18">there&amp;#39;s less revenue coming into the</text>
  <text start="426.75" dur="4.95">government and with Obamacare we see</text>
  <text start="430.89" dur="3.03">that pre</text>
  <text start="431.7" dur="4.7">are continually rising now ed Elliot who</text>
  <text start="433.92" dur="5.46">is supposed to benefit from Obamacare</text>
  <text start="436.4" dur="6.28">laid out precisely what the Affordable</text>
  <text start="439.38" dur="5.82">Care Act means for the US this is a</text>
  <text start="442.68" dur="4.41">crippling effect of the Affordable Care</text>
  <text start="445.2" dur="5.49">Act on small business owners and</text>
  <text start="447.09" dur="7.56">middle-class nineteen thousand dollar a</text>
  <text start="450.69" dur="8.28">year premiums up four times since the</text>
  <text start="454.65" dur="7.95">passage of Obamacare no way is it</text>

  <text start="530.34" dur="3.06">the Intel they said no no we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="532.38" dur="4.2">to give that you&amp;#39;ll just have to believe</text>
  <text start="533.4" dur="6.54">what we say but what&amp;#39;s happening right</text>
  <text start="536.58" dur="5.64">now is the United Kingdom plans to</text>
  <text start="539.94" dur="4.95">create a small military group in Egypt</text>
  <text start="542.22" dur="5.19">to better understand the situation in</text>
  <text start="544.89" dur="6.12">Libya and the issues of regional</text>
  <text start="547.41" dur="8.81">security so they&amp;#39;re using this incident</text>
  <text start="551.01" dur="9.39">maybe it was created to bring in troops</text>
  <text start="556.22" dur="6.55">to this area and the proposed military</text>
  <text start="560.4" dur="4.26">group will guarantee a common</text>
  <text start="562.77" dur="2.92">understanding of the security situation</text>
  <text start="564.66" dur="4.54">in Libya</text>
  <text start="565.69" dur="7.59">and help ensure that any future UK and</text>
  <text start="569.2" dur="10.22">Egyptian operation activity will succeed</text>
  <text start="573.28" dur="10.44">in this area and when we look on a map</text>
  <text start="579.42" dur="7.54">Egypt is right next to Libya we know the</text>
  <text start="583.72" dur="8.16">talks in Libya broke down we understand</text>
  <text start="586.96" dur="8.19">sissy in Egypt cold out to NATO the UK</text>
  <text start="591.88" dur="6.92">the US to say we need to do something in</text>
  <text start="595.15" dur="8.88">Libya UK right now is sending in forces</text>
  <text start="598.8" dur="9.1">into Egypt this to me seems like there</text>
  <text start="604.03" dur="8.03">is now a military buildup inside of</text>
  <text start="607.9" dur="7.38">Egypt to go into Libya and it seems like</text>
  <text start="612.06" dur="7.15">they&amp;#39;re pushing this they&amp;#39;re using the</text>
  <text start="615.28" dur="6.24">incident either as an excuse or this was</text>
  <text start="619.21" dur="4.14">planned to bring in the troops to say</text>
  <text start="621.52" dur="3.24">this is why we need to be there and it</text>
  <text start="623.35" dur="6.24">really looks like they&amp;#39;re getting ready</text>
  <text start="624.76" dur="6.6">to do something in Libya now we</text>
  <text start="629.59" dur="4.2">understand that Russia is continually</text>
  <text start="631.36" dur="5.37">bombing inside of Syria they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="633.79" dur="5.97">the rebels the rebels back the Islamic</text>

  <text start="660.25" dur="5.46">u.s. is saying the reason why there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="663.07" dur="4.92">such a lull in air strikes against the</text>
  <text start="665.71" dur="5.58">terrorists in October had nothing to do</text>
  <text start="667.99" dur="6.42">with the fact that Russia was there the</text>
  <text start="671.29" dur="5.49">reason why the United States couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="674.41" dur="4.2">fly as many sorties you&amp;#39;re never going</text>
  <text start="676.78" dur="4.83">to believe this it was because of the</text>
  <text start="678.61" dur="5.4">weather that&amp;#39;s um this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="681.61" dur="4.65">true Lieutenant General Charles Brown</text>
  <text start="684.01" dur="4.32">told reporters at the dubai</text>
  <text start="686.26" dur="4.14">international air chief skon furan stat</text>
  <text start="688.33" dur="4.38">the reduction in air strikes was due to</text>
  <text start="690.4" dur="4.23">the weather but russia had no problem</text>
  <text start="692.71" dur="4.26">flying their missions but the united</text>
  <text start="694.63" dur="4.89">states did but it had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="696.97" dur="8.3">Russia so we know this</text>
  <text start="699.52" dur="10.17">as an excuse and a lie now with the</text>
  <text start="705.27" dur="7.36">metrojet crash we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="709.69" dur="5.58">propaganda out there the u.s. the UK and</text>

  <text start="717.7" dur="4.23">the inside track they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="719.98" dur="4.44">producing evidence they&amp;#39;re just saying</text>
  <text start="721.93" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s a feeling it&amp;#39;s something we think</text>
  <text start="724.42" dur="4.53">is happening now there is some noise</text>
  <text start="727.12" dur="4.14">that is heard on the recordings right</text>
  <text start="728.95" dur="5.49">before the crash but there&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="731.26" dur="6.3">unclear of what this noise is and Russia</text>
  <text start="734.44" dur="4.8">is doing a spectral analysis and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="737.56" dur="5.22">going to try to identify it specifically</text>
  <text start="739.24" dur="4.89">what it is and an international team of</text>
