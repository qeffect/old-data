  <text start="91.229" dur="4.221">banker is the US government they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="94.11" dur="3.84">going to come up with a lot of</text>
  <text start="95.45" dur="6.309">propaganda in the next couple of weeks</text>
  <text start="97.95" dur="6.3">to explain how great the economy is how</text>
  <text start="101.759" dur="5.491">fantastic it is I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised</text>
  <text start="104.25" dur="5.49">if they bring the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="107.25" dur="4.35">down maybe even tomorrow I think the job</text>
  <text start="109.74" dur="3.45">numbers come out this friday and i</text>
  <text start="111.6" dur="6.51">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if they go under</text>

  <text start="118.11" dur="5.28">around that area to keep this illusion</text>
  <text start="121.979" dur="3.991">alive and I know the elections are</text>
  <text start="123.39" dur="4.229">coming up and they always like to make</text>

  <text start="127.619" dur="5.391">really is and we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the</text>
  <text start="129.84" dur="7.14">economy and it is really getting worse</text>
  <text start="133.01" dur="7.27">we&amp;#39;re starting to see signs that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="136.98" dur="5.82">no way that this can possibly recover at</text>
  <text start="140.28" dur="6.65">this point it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="142.8" dur="6.57">impossible walmart right now during this</text>
  <text start="146.93" dur="4.33">incredible economy is going to be</text>
  <text start="149.37" dur="5.22">cutting about 7,000 back office</text>
  <text start="151.26" dur="5.73">positions now we have to realize that</text>
  <text start="154.59" dur="4.319">there are a lot of retailers they are</text>
  <text start="156.99" dur="4.71">laying off a lot of people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="158.909" dur="5.461">closing stores going bankrupt and</text>
  <text start="161.7" dur="4.709">there&amp;#39;s a lot of individuals that</text>
  <text start="164.37" dur="5.759">don&amp;#39;t have work right now remember the</text>
  <text start="166.409" dur="6.271">part-time workers they are not counted</text>
  <text start="170.129" dur="3.901">if they&amp;#39;re not working a certain number</text>
  <text start="172.68" dur="3.869">of hours and getting paid a certain</text>
  <text start="174.03" dur="4.05">dollar amount so even though they had a</text>
  <text start="176.549" dur="3.72">part-time job but they were counted as</text>
  <text start="178.08" dur="5.34">having a full-time job when they lose</text>
  <text start="180.269" dur="5.881">that job these statistical numbers do</text>
  <text start="183.42" dur="4.44">not count them as losing the job and</text>
  <text start="186.15" dur="5.27">this is why we see this discrepancy and</text>
  <text start="187.86" dur="6.15">how many people are being laid off and</text>
  <text start="191.42" dur="5.8">how many people actually have full-time</text>
  <text start="194.01" dur="5.64">jobs we see IBM they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="197.22" dur="4.56">coming out very soon with another round</text>
  <text start="199.65" dur="5.85">of layoffs so we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="201.78" dur="5.91">watch that very carefully auto sales</text>
  <text start="205.5" dur="5.609">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking for quite a while</text>
  <text start="207.69" dur="5.82">and we know how channels stuffing works</text>
  <text start="211.109" dur="5.3">here the manufacturers produce the cars</text>
  <text start="213.51" dur="5.399">they stuff the cars into the dealer lots</text>
  <text start="216.409" dur="5.531">once the dealer receives the cars those</text>
  <text start="218.909" dur="4.95">are counted as sales the sales are not</text>
  <text start="221.94" dur="4.919">counted when they actually sell to the</text>
  <text start="223.859" dur="7.921">people and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="226.859" dur="9.121">is the channel stuffing is stuff to the</text>
  <text start="231.78" dur="6.929">maximum and auto sales right now while</text>
  <text start="235.98" dur="5.819">they&amp;#39;re a complete disaster actually the</text>
  <text start="238.709" dur="5.93">Ford executives they have said the</text>
  <text start="241.799" dur="5.91">following they&amp;#39;ve reached a plateau and</text>
  <text start="244.639" dur="4.78">any type of sale that we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="247.709" dur="5.93">have is going to be much lower in the</text>
  <text start="249.419" dur="7.231">year of 2017 ford also noted that retail</text>
  <text start="253.639" dur="6.94">incentives continue to run at</text>
  <text start="256.65" dur="6.9">historically high levels now we saw this</text>
  <text start="260.579" dur="4.671">back prior to 2008 and that was a</text>
  <text start="263.55" dur="6.03">complete disaster we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="265.25" dur="6.13">delinquencies continually rise and fort</text>

  <text start="284.699" dur="4.551">down the f-series was down 6.1 percent</text>
  <text start="287.82" dur="4.19">you escaped down two-point-eight percent</text>
  <text start="289.25" dur="7.57">explored down fifteen point five percent</text>
  <text start="292.01" dur="6.159">fusion down 32.6 percent GM well they</text>
  <text start="296.82" dur="3.51">also have the same problem</text>

  <text start="300.33" dur="9.869">percent which is horrific dealer</text>
  <text start="306.12" dur="8.879">inventories increased to 74 days from 66</text>
  <text start="310.199" dur="7.77">days last year and it&amp;#39;s not just GM and</text>

  <text start="330.779" dur="5.85">here is getting worse and worse as time</text>
  <text start="333.9" dur="6.5">goes on and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of these</text>
  <text start="336.629" dur="8.16">economic indicators they are really</text>
  <text start="340.4" dur="7.419">declining very very quickly we see the</text>
  <text start="344.789" dur="5.91">American worker productivity well it</text>
  <text start="347.819" dur="6.63">just got worse again actually this is</text>
  <text start="350.699" dur="5.821">the biggest decline since 1993 and we</text>
  <text start="354.449" dur="5.671">can see the second quarter of worker</text>
  <text start="356.52" dur="8.129">productivity it was down to negative</text>
  <text start="360.12" dur="10.979">point six percent and this is the third</text>
  <text start="364.649" dur="10.08">quarterly decline since 1979 what does</text>
  <text start="371.099" dur="9">this tell us it tells us that this</text>
  <text start="374.729" dur="8.071">system is contracting it&amp;#39;s not expanding</text>
  <text start="380.099" dur="4.91">it&amp;#39;s not getting any better it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="382.8" dur="4.589">actually getting worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="385.009" dur="6.46">we&amp;#39;re noticing that all the dead cat</text>
  <text start="387.389" dur="6.81">bounces they&amp;#39;re gone we&amp;#39;re noticing that</text>
  <text start="391.469" dur="7.44">that high that we&amp;#39;re coming off of in</text>
  <text start="394.199" dur="7.44">July no longer exists in August we see</text>
  <text start="398.909" dur="5.28">us manufacturing the PMI and the service</text>

  <text start="404.189" dur="6.991">bounce is over and we see new orders</text>
  <text start="408.27" dur="4.799">arse lying employment is sliding well</text>
  <text start="411.18" dur="6.419">market has a simple explanation for all</text>
  <text start="413.069" dur="9.12">this that there is evidence suggests</text>
  <text start="417.599" dur="8.43">that this is at least in part of a</text>
  <text start="422.189" dur="6.63">slowing economy and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="426.029" dur="5.881">that the situation is getting worse and</text>
  <text start="428.819" dur="6.781">worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="431.91" dur="7.23">and when we look at this we need to say</text>
  <text start="435.6" dur="5.88">to ourselves if this economy is doing</text>
  <text start="439.14" dur="4.8">better like the US government central</text>
  <text start="441.48" dur="7.98">bankers are telling us we should see</text>
  <text start="443.94" dur="10.31">these economic sectors increasing and</text>
  <text start="449.46" dur="10.98">expanding we shouldn&amp;#39;t see corporations</text>
  <text start="454.25" dur="10.06">laying off employees by the thousands we</text>
  <text start="460.44" dur="8.88">shouldn&amp;#39;t see stores closing going</text>
  <text start="464.31" dur="8.61">bankrupt by the thousands we shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="469.32" dur="5.58">see corporate earnings declining we</text>
  <text start="472.92" dur="3.36">shouldn&amp;#39;t see corporations laying off</text>
  <text start="474.9" dur="4.53">the number of people that are laid off</text>
  <text start="476.28" dur="5.91">by the way the according to challenge or</text>
  <text start="479.43" dur="7.17">grin Christmas the number of people have</text>
  <text start="482.19" dur="8.1">been laid off since july of 2014 up to</text>
  <text start="486.6" dur="6.6">this point is something like 1.2 million</text>
  <text start="490.29" dur="4.88">people already and the number of people</text>
  <text start="493.2" dur="5.85">that are actually getting these jobs</text>
  <text start="495.17" dur="6.25">well these are all part time and those</text>
  <text start="499.05" dur="4.1">people who aren&amp;#39;t getting the jobs the</text>
  <text start="501.42" dur="4.98">government just doesn&amp;#39;t count them and</text>
  <text start="503.15" dur="5.05">we&amp;#39;re noticing that college grads</text>
  <text start="506.4" dur="6.3">they&amp;#39;re having a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="508.2" dur="8.43">finding the employment finding the job</text>

  <text start="520.289" dur="5.131">why they&amp;#39;re living at home this is why</text>
  <text start="522.12" dur="6.41">their loans have been modified and they</text>
  <text start="525.42" dur="6.5">modify them to how much they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="528.53" dur="6.49">so if they have a part-time job and</text>
  <text start="531.92" dur="6.7">there making an hourly wage of say like</text>
  <text start="535.02" dur="5.37">10 or 11 whatever they&amp;#39;re making they</text>
  <text start="538.62" dur="6.14">recalculate their student loans and</text>
  <text start="540.39" dur="7.29">that&amp;#39;s what the payment is calculated on</text>
  <text start="544.76" dur="7.8">because otherwise they would be in</text>
  <text start="547.68" dur="9.66">default we see that the central banks</text>
  <text start="552.56" dur="6.57">they are driving all acid prices the</text>
  <text start="557.34" dur="5.01">global central bank liquidity injections</text>

  <text start="562.35" dur="3.51">moment have surpassed all previous post</text>
  <text start="565.53" dur="5.16">fun</text>
  <text start="565.86" dur="8.39">Christ central bank intervention and we</text>
  <text start="570.69" dur="7.86">can compare this economy to a patient</text>
  <text start="574.25" dur="7.29">who is laying in the hospital who is</text>
  <text start="578.55" dur="9.659">hooked up to machines and is kept alive</text>
  <text start="581.54" dur="9.82">on machines they have no other function</text>
  <text start="588.209" dur="7.021">if the machines are removed they just</text>
  <text start="591.36" dur="6.599">die and this is exactly what this</text>
  <text start="595.23" dur="6.27">economy is like it is hooked up to the</text>
  <text start="597.959" dur="8.671">machines the economy will never function</text>
  <text start="601.5" dur="7.529">correctly economy will not recover it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="606.63" dur="9">the machines that are creating the</text>
  <text start="609.029" dur="9.99">illusion of the economy working and we</text>
  <text start="615.63" dur="7.74">can see as time goes on the economy will</text>
  <text start="619.019" dur="7.491">continually deteriorate the systems the</text>
  <text start="623.37" dur="9.87">functions will break down and eventually</text>
  <text start="626.51" dur="9.04">the economy will collapse now they can</text>
  <text start="633.24" dur="5.37">pull the machines and control the</text>
  <text start="635.55" dur="6.87">collapse and we&amp;#39;re starting to see this</text>
  <text start="638.61" dur="6.87">is exactly where they&amp;#39;re headed they</text>
  <text start="642.42" dur="6.33">want to control what is happening right</text>
  <text start="645.48" dur="8.66">now because we&amp;#39;ve reached the zero point</text>
  <text start="648.75" dur="8.55">of debt creation 45 years and counting I</text>
  <text start="654.14" dur="5.8">mean we&amp;#39;ve been on this debt system</text>
  <text start="657.3" dur="6.57">since the early 70s when we went off the</text>
  <text start="659.94" dur="6.56">gold standard we see trade deficits</text>

  <text start="666.5" dur="6.04">entitlements private debt you name it</text>
  <text start="669.089" dur="8.881">our total debt has grown to 2.5 times</text>

  <text start="683.07" dur="4.47">create less and less of an effect</text>
  <text start="685.61" dur="4.659">eventually what happens is you reach</text>
  <text start="687.54" dur="9.26">reach this point where there is no more</text>
  <text start="690.269" dur="11.911">effect and the drug kills you from</text>

  <text start="702.18" dur="8.82">this zero point and every dollar of debt</text>
  <text start="705.74" dur="10.84">that has been produced well it feeds</text>
  <text start="711" dur="8.22">into GDP less and less and less this is</text>
  <text start="716.58" dur="6.57">what&amp;#39;s been happening since we&amp;#39;ve come</text>
  <text start="719.22" dur="6.9">off the gold standard and we can see</text>
  <text start="723.15" dur="6.48">right now in the 20 years between 1995</text>
  <text start="726.12" dur="6.3">and 2015 the debt grew at a rate of four</text>
  <text start="729.63" dur="5.7">point two times GDP and stock prices</text>

  <text start="775.77" dur="8.37">interestingly we are seeing since 1970</text>
  <text start="780.47" dur="9.34">that every time construction spending</text>
  <text start="784.14" dur="9.35">growth slows the u.s. enters a recession</text>
  <text start="789.81" dur="7.35">a great recession or depression since</text>
  <text start="793.49" dur="8.83">1970 we have been seeing this and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="797.16" dur="8.52">seen it seven times and here we are at</text>
  <text start="802.32" dur="7.92">the height of construction spending it</text>
  <text start="805.68" dur="10.31">is now slowing declining which means we</text>
  <text start="810.24" dur="9.66">are ready for a collapse of the system</text>
  <text start="815.99" dur="6.73">we see that Amazon who is going to work</text>
