  <text start="54.39" dur="5.22">gold is being suppressed and we knew it</text>
  <text start="57.75" dur="5.34">was going to start to be pushed down</text>
  <text start="59.61" dur="4.71">because we saw gold was rising and we</text>
  <text start="63.09" dur="4.02">knew eventually what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="64.32" dur="5.07">was come back in use paper contracts</text>
  <text start="67.11" dur="4.44">push the goal back down but what&amp;#39;s going</text>

  <text start="71.55" dur="3.959">rise once again and it is going to get</text>
  <text start="74.04" dur="3.27">harder and harder for them to</text>
  <text start="75.509" dur="3.72">continually do this and this is when</text>
  <text start="77.31" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re going to lose control because</text>
  <text start="79.229" dur="5.041">the indicators that we&amp;#39;re looking at at</text>
  <text start="81.21" dur="4.769">this point they&amp;#39;re all showing us that</text>
  <text start="84.27" dur="3.33">we&amp;#39;re heading into this major collapse</text>
  <text start="85.979" dur="2.761">and there&amp;#39;s really no other way to look</text>
  <text start="87.6" dur="3.78">at this I know a lot of people say well</text>
  <text start="88.74" dur="4.44">you know manufacturing might that might</text>
  <text start="91.38" dur="3.9">be down but we have the service sector</text>
  <text start="93.18" dur="3.75">but we really don&amp;#39;t have the service</text>
  <text start="95.28" dur="4.83">sector because that&amp;#39;s declining well</text>
  <text start="96.93" dur="5.76">housings really doing well but we do see</text>
  <text start="100.11" dur="4.95">prices falling we still we do see houses</text>
  <text start="102.69" dur="5.31">on the market longer and longer there is</text>
  <text start="105.06" dur="5.25">information coming out of the corporate</text>
  <text start="108" dur="4.11">media saying well housing starting to</text>
  <text start="110.31" dur="3.84">slow and if we really look back in time</text>
  <text start="112.11" dur="5.91">housing really haven&amp;#39;t gone anywhere we</text>
  <text start="114.15" dur="6.66">see retail well that&amp;#39;s declining that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="118.02" dur="5.37">a fact it&amp;#39;s not doing anything stores</text>
  <text start="120.81" dur="4.68">are closing their contracting so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="123.39" dur="6.12">getting harder and harder to convince</text>
  <text start="125.49" dur="6.09">people that everything is okay and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="129.51" dur="3.36">starting to see that all their</text>
  <text start="131.58" dur="3.659">statistical information that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="132.87" dur="5.07">throwing at us it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="135.239" dur="4.201">whatsoever anymore I mean they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="137.94" dur="3.57">out with the initial jobless claims and</text>
  <text start="139.44" dur="4.74">of course they use the word unexpectedly</text>
  <text start="141.51" dur="5.069">plunge 243 year lows oh my god it just</text>
  <text start="144.18" dur="4.46">unexpectedly just plunged and we&amp;#39;re back</text>
  <text start="146.579" dur="4.771">to nineteen seventy three levels and</text>
  <text start="148.64" dur="4.599">when you look at these numbers you say</text>
  <text start="151.35" dur="4.02">okay initial jobless claims it</text>
  <text start="153.239" dur="3.72">continually Falls they have to match it</text>
  <text start="155.37" dur="3.57">up to the unemployment numbers which</text>
  <text start="156.959" dur="4.621">they continually manipulate and when we</text>
  <text start="158.94" dur="5.22">compare it to the is M services</text>
  <text start="161.58" dur="4.44">employment which is declining now</text>
  <text start="164.16" dur="4.11">it makes no sense because more and more</text>
  <text start="166.02" dur="5.88">jobs are being lost in this area when we</text>
  <text start="168.27" dur="7.35">look at manufacturing manufacturing we</text>
  <text start="171.9" dur="5.87">know jobs are being lost so okay these</text>
  <text start="175.62" dur="5.1">two areas we see jobs are declining and</text>
  <text start="177.77" dur="6.25">initial jobless claims are continually</text>
  <text start="180.72" dur="5.19">falling and then we look at the NFIB</text>
  <text start="184.02" dur="5.37">small business employment which is</text>
  <text start="185.91" dur="7.71">declining rapidly we see initial jobless</text>
  <text start="189.39" dur="6.84">claims continually fallen and every day</text>
  <text start="193.62" dur="5.9">we get a new round of people being laid</text>
  <text start="196.23" dur="6.72">off we realize that the high-paying jobs</text>
  <text start="199.52" dur="5.92">they&amp;#39;re non-existent at this point we</text>
  <text start="202.95" dur="5.46">see symantec they&amp;#39;re going to be laying</text>
  <text start="205.44" dur="7.38">off people the exact number is not known</text>
  <text start="208.41" dur="6.48">yet UC Berkeley 500 staff jobs american</text>
  <text start="212.82" dur="6.15">apparel up there layoffs to about 500</text>
  <text start="214.89" dur="7.64">plus Alcoa they&amp;#39;re up to 2,000 people</text>
  <text start="218.97" dur="9.21">and we are continually seeing this</text>
  <text start="222.53" dur="8.65">non-stop and this tells us that someone</text>
  <text start="228.18" dur="6.84">again is lying and you know who it is</text>
  <text start="231.18" dur="7.05">it&amp;#39;s the US government they continually</text>
  <text start="235.02" dur="5.91">lie to the people remember the central</text>
  <text start="238.23" dur="6.72">banks are not in it for the people their</text>
  <text start="240.93" dur="6.27">product is debt and all they do is put</text>
  <text start="244.95" dur="4.19">people into more and more debt they put</text>
  <text start="247.2" dur="6.75">countries into more and more debt and</text>
  <text start="249.14" dur="9.01">they buy up the real assets for pennies</text>
  <text start="253.95" dur="8.31">on the dollar now we are definitely</text>
  <text start="258.15" dur="6">seeing how bad things are getting Macy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="262.26" dur="4.86">right now they&amp;#39;re going to be giving</text>
  <text start="264.15" dur="6.09">away gift cards in exchange for used</text>
  <text start="267.12" dur="6.81">clothes now they pardoned up with this</text>

  <text start="287.61" dur="4.17">is going to work but you can see that</text>
  <text start="289.25" dur="4.56">Macy&amp;#39;s is hurting at this point if they</text>
  <text start="291.78" dur="6.21">need to go to this level because when</text>
  <text start="293.81" dur="7.33">everything is fine retail is expanding</text>
  <text start="297.99" dur="4.77">people have discretionary funds they</text>
  <text start="301.14" dur="3.12">don&amp;#39;t need to do this they feel</text>
  <text start="302.76" dur="3.96">comfortable in going out and purchasing</text>
  <text start="304.26" dur="4.11">clothes so you might get you know</text>
  <text start="306.72" dur="3.18">fifteen twenty dollars for your clothing</text>
  <text start="308.37" dur="3.27">and it&amp;#39;s not just like a pair of pants</text>
  <text start="309.9" dur="3.24">and a shirt or a dress or something like</text>
  <text start="311.64" dur="3.96">that it&amp;#39;s probably all bundled together</text>
  <text start="313.14" dur="4.08">you&amp;#39;re going to take that and go spend a</text>
  <text start="315.6" dur="3.45">hundred and forty dollars or whatever it</text>
  <text start="317.22" dur="4.59">is whatever amount you spend on clothing</text>
  <text start="319.05" dur="4.62">and that&amp;#39;s really not going to make a</text>
  <text start="321.81" dur="3.15">big difference to a lot of people I know</text>
  <text start="323.67" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s not going to make a big difference</text>
  <text start="324.96" dur="6">in my family but they&amp;#39;re doing whatever</text>
  <text start="328.08" dur="6.81">they possibly can to get people to</text>
  <text start="330.96" dur="6.48">purchase in retail because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="334.89" dur="6.6">starting to realize the economy is</text>
  <text start="337.44" dur="6.6">what&amp;#39;s hurting the people it&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="341.49" dur="5.52">central banks have done is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="344.04" dur="7.65">actually hurting the business it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="347.01" dur="7.26">the weather it&amp;#39;s not the holidays the</text>
  <text start="351.69" dur="4.29">way they fall it&amp;#39;s not that the store</text>
  <text start="354.27" dur="4.95">needs to be cleaned up it has nothing to</text>
  <text start="355.98" dur="6.12">do with any of that it has to do with</text>
  <text start="359.22" dur="6.12">people losing jobs it has to do with</text>
  <text start="362.1" dur="8.07">people who cannot find jobs people who</text>
  <text start="365.34" dur="7.02">find part-time jobs that&amp;#39;s it but of</text>
  <text start="370.17" dur="4.05">course the corporate media the central</text>
  <text start="372.36" dur="4.23">bank the US government they want to make</text>
  <text start="374.22" dur="5.7">you think something completely else is</text>
  <text start="376.59" dur="5.55">going on here now we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="379.92" dur="4.98">the housing market start to really fall</text>
  <text start="382.14" dur="5.52">apart here out in San Francisco we see</text>
  <text start="384.9" dur="5.25">that home prices are starting to fall</text>
  <text start="387.66" dur="4.2">for the first time in four years home</text>
  <text start="390.15" dur="5.28">prices fell by one point eight percent</text>
  <text start="391.86" dur="5.52">year-on-year in March and right now San</text>
  <text start="395.43" dur="4.92">Francisco is one of the most expensive</text>
  <text start="397.38" dur="5.79">housing markets in America and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="400.35" dur="5.27">starting to see that people are saying</text>
  <text start="403.17" dur="5.25">okay this is getting out of my reach</text>
  <text start="405.62" dur="5.26">housing prices are being pumped up</text>
  <text start="408.42" dur="4.83">artificially and they do this very</text>
  <text start="410.88" dur="4.47">easily by telling the banks to keep the</text>
  <text start="413.25" dur="3.8">housing the houses the foreclosures and</text>
  <text start="415.35" dur="4.62">everything else off the market</text>
  <text start="417.05" dur="4.45">investment hedge funds foreign investors</text>
  <text start="419.97" dur="3.36">come in there by thousands of thousands</text>
  <text start="421.5" dur="2.94">of house they don&amp;#39;t resell them they try</text>
  <text start="423.33" dur="3.51">to rent them at the camp but they keep</text>
  <text start="424.44" dur="4.41">them off the market the Fed steps in and</text>
  <text start="426.84" dur="4.95">buys all the toxic real estate you know</text>
  <text start="428.85" dur="5.99">trillions and trillions of dollars worth</text>
  <text start="431.79" dur="5.52">and it&amp;#39;s very easy to manipulate certain</text>
  <text start="434.84" dur="5.49">cities around the country now can they</text>
  <text start="437.31" dur="5.22">do everything no this is why we see</text>
  <text start="440.33" dur="4.96">inconsistencies out there this is why</text>
  <text start="442.53" dur="5.97">when I look in certain areas we see</text>
  <text start="445.29" dur="5.67">houses on the market 90 120 days 150</text>
  <text start="448.5" dur="7.29">days price is continually coming down 10</text>
  <text start="450.96" dur="7.62">20 30 40 thousand dollars because what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="455.79" dur="5.46">really going on out there is that houses</text>
  <text start="458.58" dur="3.93">are not really selling the American</text>
  <text start="461.25" dur="4.29">people are sitting on the sidelines</text>
  <text start="462.51" dur="5.25">right now and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="465.54" dur="5.34">this whole thing is starting to crack</text>
  <text start="467.76" dur="7.5">and fall apart and this will accelerate</text>
  <text start="470.88" dur="7.23">as time goes on now everyone on the</text>
  <text start="475.26" dur="5.18">alternative media normally talks about</text>
  <text start="478.11" dur="8.06">the manipulation in gold and silver and</text>
  <text start="480.44" dur="8.4">we&amp;#39;re getting word that yes banks do</text>
  <text start="486.17" dur="5.44">manipulate the precious metals market</text>
  <text start="488.84" dur="5.2">now group of silver bullion banks</text>
  <text start="491.61" dur="6.48">Deutsche Bank Bank of Nova Nova Scotia</text>
  <text start="494.04" dur="5.19">HSBC and UBS they were accused of</text>
  <text start="498.09" dur="3.27">manipulating the prices in the</text>
  <text start="499.23" dur="4.62">multi-billion dollar market now there</text>
  <text start="501.36" dur="5.85">was a lawsuit which was originally filed</text>
  <text start="503.85" dur="6.48">in New York in the district court by</text>
  <text start="507.21" dur="5.91">litigator Jay Scott Nicholson he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="510.33" dur="5.76">resident of Washington DC and he alleged</text>
  <text start="513.12" dur="6.51">at the banks manipulated the silver</text>
  <text start="516.09" dur="8.22">market the physical silver the comox</text>
  <text start="519.63" dur="7.35">futures since January of 2007 and we</text>
  <text start="524.31" dur="5.43">come to find out that deutsche bank</text>
  <text start="526.98" dur="5.94">agreed to settle the litigation over</text>
  <text start="529.74" dur="5.66">allegations into illegally conspiring</text>
  <text start="532.92" dur="9.02">with bank of nova scotia nova scotia</text>
  <text start="535.4" dur="11.04">hsbc and USB in fixing the silver prices</text>
  <text start="541.94" dur="8.26">now we also come to find out that</text>
  <text start="546.44" dur="9.76">deutsche bank was conspiring with these</text>
  <text start="550.2" dur="8.55">same banks to fix gold prices so what</text>
  <text start="556.2" dur="6.24">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is through these</text>
  <text start="558.75" dur="6.69">lawsuits the banking system the central</text>
  <text start="562.44" dur="5.96">banking system</text>
  <text start="565.44" dur="5.4">is doing this and they are definitely</text>
  <text start="568.4" dur="5.07">manipulating the market and it&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="570.84" dur="5.13">how we can start to see the patterns of</text>
  <text start="573.47" dur="4.9">manipulation because just a couple days</text>
  <text start="575.97" dur="4.68">ago we discussed how when the goal goes</text>
  <text start="578.37" dur="4.77">up all of a sudden we&amp;#39;re going to see it</text>
  <text start="580.65" dur="7.26">suppressed in the next couple of days</text>
  <text start="583.14" dur="7.14">and it happens every single time so what</text>
  <text start="587.91" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is why boar is</text>
  <text start="590.28" dur="7.53">manipulated silver is manipulated gold</text>
  <text start="593.25" dur="8.49">is manipulated the entire world is one</text>
  <text start="597.81" dur="6.47">big manipulation game and it&amp;#39;s not to</text>
  <text start="601.74" dur="5.34">any of our benefit it&amp;#39;s to their benefit</text>
  <text start="604.28" dur="4.18">now Janet Yellen out of all these</text>
  <text start="607.08" dur="3.72">meetings these emergency meetings they</text>
  <text start="608.46" dur="5.4">were having with obama-biden finance</text>
  <text start="610.8" dur="6.78">ministers and other bankers they came to</text>
  <text start="613.86" dur="7.29">the conclusion that they are focused on</text>
  <text start="617.58" dur="7.08">helping all Americans and all the people</text>
  <text start="621.15" dur="5.55">around the globe on Main Street because</text>
  <text start="624.66" dur="5.99">they&amp;#39;re going to support economic</text>
  <text start="626.7" dur="6.84">conditions like jobs stable prices and</text>
  <text start="630.65" dur="6.7">everything else well we know this is a</text>
  <text start="633.54" dur="6.6">lie we know that this is not what they</text>
  <text start="637.35" dur="8.93">do they are a private company</text>
  <text start="640.14" dur="11.22">corporation they are not a government</text>
  <text start="646.28" dur="9.58">office they have stockholders they have</text>
  <text start="651.36" dur="6.45">a product called debt and we can see</text>
  <text start="655.86" dur="4.23">from everything that they&amp;#39;ve done and</text>
  <text start="657.81" dur="5.07">i&amp;#39;m not talking about their words i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="660.09" dur="4.38">talking about their actions that they</text>
  <text start="662.88" dur="3.81">are not working for Main Street they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="664.47" dur="4.35">working for the banks just like gold</text>
  <text start="666.69" dur="4.86">silver LIBOR the interest rates are</text>
  <text start="668.82" dur="6.15">manipulated well guess what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="671.55" dur="6.12">manipulating everything else for those</text>
  <text start="674.97" dur="5.49">banks because when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="677.67" dur="4.98">see student loans skyrocketing a bubble</text>
  <text start="680.46" dur="5.09">being pumped up food stamps at all-time</text>
  <text start="682.65" dur="6.72">highs the federal debt all-time high</text>
  <text start="685.55" dur="6.7">money printing all-time high health care</text>
  <text start="689.37" dur="6.02">costs continually rising all-time high</text>
  <text start="692.25" dur="5.85">the labor force participation rate</text>
  <text start="695.39" dur="3.61">all-time low I mean we&amp;#39;re going all the</text>
  <text start="698.1" dur="5.79">way back</text>
  <text start="699" dur="6.87">into the 80s 70s right now we see median</text>
  <text start="703.89" dur="6.72">family income declining and</text>
  <text start="705.87" dur="6.81">homeownership at all-time lows so how</text>
  <text start="710.61" dur="4.95">are they working for the people I&amp;#39;m a</text>
