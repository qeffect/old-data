  <text start="97.85" dur="4.56">wants to believe that this is going down</text>
  <text start="99.8" dur="7.349">for this reason or that reason but this</text>
  <text start="102.41" dur="7.62">is a manipulated market it is a tool and</text>
  <text start="107.149" dur="4.291">they&amp;#39;re using it against each other and</text>
  <text start="110.03" dur="3.66">what am I talking about I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="111.44" dur="5.37">about the central banks the deep state</text>
  <text start="113.69" dur="5.94">and the Trump administration they are</text>
  <text start="116.81" dur="5.339">fighting it out right now now they both</text>
  <text start="119.63" dur="5.7">have their own weapons they&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="122.149" dur="4.92">control the system Trump administration</text>
  <text start="125.33" dur="4.8">the plunge Protection Team the</text>
  <text start="127.069" dur="5.491">high-frequency trading they can try to</text>
  <text start="130.13" dur="5.04">pump it back up we have the central</text>
  <text start="132.56" dur="7.23">banks where they can control the market</text>
  <text start="135.17" dur="6.99">through algorithms by having other</text>
  <text start="139.79" dur="5.55">central banks purchase stock and right</text>
  <text start="142.16" dur="5.549">now we are seeing this whole thing play</text>
  <text start="145.34" dur="5.31">out right in front of our eyes and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="147.709" dur="5.431">gonna discuss that in a little bit later</text>
  <text start="150.65" dur="5.669">in this report but I wanted to start off</text>
  <text start="153.14" dur="5.4">here with an inflation alert because</text>
  <text start="156.319" dur="4.771">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="158.54" dur="4.8">a lot of things happen all at once and</text>
  <text start="161.09" dur="3.81">we have to remember that with all these</text>
  <text start="163.34" dur="3.869">investigations with everything coming</text>
  <text start="164.9" dur="4.5">out now and every time something new</text>
  <text start="167.209" dur="4.591">comes out we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more</text>
  <text start="169.4" dur="4.68">chaos and that&amp;#39;s exactly what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="171.8" dur="4.409">seeing now the inflation alert is</text>
  <text start="174.08" dur="6.36">because the velocity of money it has</text>
  <text start="176.209" dur="6.451">finally hit bottom and when we look at</text>
  <text start="180.44" dur="4.56">this we can see that it has hit the</text>
  <text start="182.66" dur="4.38">bottom right now now when we look at</text>
  <text start="185" dur="4.53">this we can say all right</text>
  <text start="187.04" dur="7.619">the velocity money has been falling all</text>
  <text start="189.53" dur="8.159">along if we go back to 1995 to 2000 2005</text>
  <text start="194.659" dur="5.311">all the way up to the present day we see</text>
  <text start="197.689" dur="6.121">that it has dropped now the velocity of</text>
  <text start="199.97" dur="7.859">money the m2 money supply was around 2.2</text>
  <text start="203.81" dur="6.75">percent around 1995 we are down to 1.4</text>
  <text start="207.829" dur="5.33">right now now of course we need to</text>
  <text start="210.56" dur="6.41">understand that when the Fed was</text>
  <text start="213.159" dur="5.86">printing all this money for stimulus</text>
  <text start="216.97" dur="3.82">everyone thought we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="219.019" dur="3.661">inflation but they were very smart in</text>
  <text start="220.79" dur="3.869">what they did to make sure that</text>
  <text start="222.68" dur="6.449">inflation didn&amp;#39;t hit now we did see</text>
  <text start="224.659" dur="9.33">inflation in foods in the stock market</text>
  <text start="229.129" dur="6.69">in housing in tuition because what they</text>
  <text start="233.989" dur="5.941">did was they offloaded it to all these</text>
  <text start="235.819" dur="6.121">different areas now the Fed was out</text>
  <text start="239.93" dur="4.649">there and they were trying to explain</text>
  <text start="241.94" dur="5.1">why we haven&amp;#39;t been seeing inflation</text>
  <text start="244.579" dur="3.931">because they were making the excuse that</text>
  <text start="247.04" dur="3.419">you know people will hoarding all the</text>
  <text start="248.51" dur="4.439">cash they weren&amp;#39;t spending it out in</text>
  <text start="250.459" dur="4.68">retail and this is the reason why this</text>
  <text start="252.949" dur="3.72">wasn&amp;#39;t happening now the reason why they</text>
  <text start="255.139" dur="3.451">actually came out and said that is</text>
  <text start="256.669" dur="3.991">because this is one of the areas that</text>
  <text start="258.59" dur="4.799">they can&amp;#39;t control they can&amp;#39;t control</text>
  <text start="260.66" dur="5.039">people spending their money they can</text>
  <text start="263.389" dur="5.4">control the suit and loan debt they can</text>
  <text start="265.699" dur="4.951">control the housing debt with loans they</text>
  <text start="268.789" dur="3.75">can control the automobile market with</text>
  <text start="270.65" dur="5.579">debt with loans but the thing they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="272.539" dur="5.641">do is get people hired increase salaries</text>
  <text start="276.229" dur="4.44">and have people spend their money and</text>
  <text start="278.18" dur="4.98">they kept saying this over and over and</text>
  <text start="280.669" dur="4.381">over saying that listen the reason why</text>
  <text start="283.16" dur="4.259">we&amp;#39;re not seeing any of this this is why</text>
  <text start="285.05" dur="4.619">because people are just hoarding their</text>
  <text start="287.419" dur="3.451">money they&amp;#39;re not out there spending it</text>
  <text start="289.669" dur="3.12">in retail and they wanted people to</text>
  <text start="290.87" dur="5.579">spend in retail because this would help</text>
  <text start="292.789" dur="6.651">the economy because 70 percent or so of</text>
  <text start="296.449" dur="6.081">GDP is people spending their money and</text>
  <text start="299.44" dur="7.33">the reason why we know this is a lie</text>
  <text start="302.53" dur="7.09">because the u.s. savings rate is at</text>
  <text start="306.77" dur="5.73">record low so if people are hoarding</text>
  <text start="309.62" dur="6.09">their money why is the US savings rate</text>
  <text start="312.5" dur="7.229">at record lows does this make sense</text>
  <text start="315.71" dur="5.13">no it doesn&amp;#39;t they said this to make</text>
  <text start="319.729" dur="3.481">everyone believe</text>
  <text start="320.84" dur="5.46">that this is the reason why this was</text>
  <text start="323.21" dur="5.7">happening now we see the velocity money</text>
  <text start="326.3" dur="4.8">it hit bottom and most likely we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="328.91" dur="6.87">going to see this thing take off and</text>
  <text start="331.1" dur="6.36">we&amp;#39;re going to see inflation and we can</text>
  <text start="335.78" dur="3.81">see that everything is starting to break</text>
  <text start="337.46" dur="4.019">down right now we see that the stock</text>
  <text start="339.59" dur="4.5">market came down around 1,000 points</text>
  <text start="341.479" dur="5.431">today this is a stock market war and</text>
  <text start="344.09" dur="6.18">what we need to look at is gold and the</text>
  <text start="346.91" dur="4.49">Kryptos because if this is truly the</text>
  <text start="350.27" dur="3.93">crash</text>
  <text start="351.4" dur="4.51">which I don&amp;#39;t think it is just yet I</text>
  <text start="354.2" dur="3.779">think we&amp;#39;re gonna see this play out for</text>
  <text start="355.91" dur="5.52">a little while here we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="357.979" dur="6.301">people rush into gold rush into silver</text>
  <text start="361.43" dur="5.61">rush into the Crypt dose and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="364.28" dur="5.82">gonna see that rise now if you see gold</text>
  <text start="367.04" dur="5.04">silver the kryptos taking off like crazy</text>
  <text start="370.1" dur="4.8">and it might be the kryptos first then</text>
  <text start="372.08" dur="6">gold you know something&amp;#39;s up so if you</text>
  <text start="374.9" dur="6.269">see gold for a great example if you see</text>
  <text start="378.08" dur="4.95">gold moving up by 50 100 moving up like</text>
  <text start="381.169" dur="3.991">that you know something&amp;#39;s going on now</text>
  <text start="383.03" dur="4.77">they might use a flash type of paper</text>
  <text start="385.16" dur="5.46">crash on gold where they bring it back</text>
  <text start="387.8" dur="4.679">down and they try to control it during</text>
  <text start="390.62" dur="4.23">this whole period of time but you can</text>
  <text start="392.479" dur="6.031">see that this is someplace we need to</text>
  <text start="394.85" dur="5.91">look now we need to understand that the</text>
  <text start="398.51" dur="4.32">battle is being waged right in front of</text>
  <text start="400.76" dur="5.61">us and we understand that there&amp;#39;s a new</text>
  <text start="402.83" dur="5.25">Fed chair in office right now and Janet</text>
  <text start="406.37" dur="5.609">Yellen has left we have Jerome Powell</text>
  <text start="408.08" dur="6.72">right now and if we go back in time he</text>
  <text start="411.979" dur="5.971">says yes we need to bring the market</text>
  <text start="414.8" dur="4.47">down now the corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="417.95" dur="3.899">there and they&amp;#39;re saying yes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="419.27" dur="5.79">heading into this bear market we should</text>
  <text start="421.849" dur="4.201">panic and they&amp;#39;re telling everyone you</text>
  <text start="425.06" dur="4.41">know this is what you should be doing</text>
  <text start="426.05" dur="6.75">and so forth and so on now most likely</text>
  <text start="429.47" dur="5.37">they want this to you know clog up the</text>
  <text start="432.8" dur="4.53">news feed will it clog up the news feed</text>
  <text start="434.84" dur="7.049">most likely not but most of America</text>
  <text start="437.33" dur="7.32">might be concentrated on the Dow coming</text>
  <text start="441.889" dur="4.921">down you know a thousand points 500</text>
  <text start="444.65" dur="4.23">points and people will be distracted by</text>
  <text start="446.81" dur="4.26">this from all the other news that is</text>
  <text start="448.88" dur="5.61">going on and we&amp;#39;re gonna see this play</text>
  <text start="451.07" dur="7.53">out probably over the next couple days</text>
  <text start="454.49" dur="5.49">weeks whatever now the thing is we</text>
  <text start="458.6" dur="4.35">understand that we&amp;#39;re going through a</text>
  <text start="459.98" dur="5.939">transition right now the transition is</text>
  <text start="462.95" dur="6">not complete everything is still in the</text>
  <text start="465.919" dur="4.381">works so why would the deep state the</text>
  <text start="468.95" dur="4.95">central bankers want to bring down</text>
  <text start="470.3" dur="6.06">everything right now well they can bring</text>
  <text start="473.9" dur="4.92">it down now to stop the transition</text>
  <text start="476.36" dur="5.34">remember the transition is to move away</text>
  <text start="478.82" dur="5.16">from the central banking system the</text>
  <text start="481.7" dur="5.07">transition is to maybe go into</text>
  <text start="483.98" dur="7.2">cryptocurrencies get rid of the central</text>
  <text start="486.77" dur="6.62">bank and set us up for the one belt one</text>
  <text start="491.18" dur="4.83">road to join the trade system with China</text>
  <text start="493.39" dur="4.42">have peace around the world and again</text>
  <text start="496.01" dur="4.65">the deep state they definitely don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="497.81" dur="6.53">want this they don&amp;#39;t want this at all if</text>
  <text start="500.66" dur="8.58">they interrupt it right now all of this</text>
  <text start="504.34" dur="9.129">stops and they can finish their their</text>
  <text start="509.24" dur="6.929">transition over to a new system and they</text>
  <text start="513.469" dur="5.041">might head down this path but for right</text>
  <text start="516.169" dur="5.67">now I do believe we&amp;#39;re gonna see the</text>
  <text start="518.51" dur="5.459">market move back up come back down and</text>
  <text start="521.839" dur="3.841">basically it&amp;#39;s gonna go nowhere because</text>
  <text start="523.969" dur="5.271">both of them are going to be controlling</text>
  <text start="525.68" dur="7.98">what is happening here and at this point</text>
  <text start="529.24" dur="7">this can go either way at a split second</text>
  <text start="533.66" dur="4.74">depending on on how everything goes</text>
  <text start="536.24" dur="4.8">that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m saying watch the crypto</text>
  <text start="538.4" dur="6.09">market watch gold see what people are</text>
  <text start="541.04" dur="6.78">doing with their funds see what people</text>
  <text start="544.49" dur="6.27">are piling into and once again even if</text>
  <text start="547.82" dur="4.89">you see say gold move up you know 50 60</text>
  <text start="550.76" dur="4.26">70 dollars or whatever it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="552.71" dur="5.879">and then it&amp;#39;s smashed back down you know</text>
  <text start="555.02" dur="5.67">people are putting their funds into gold</text>
  <text start="558.589" dur="4.651">and getting out of the market because</text>
  <text start="560.69" dur="5.28">gold is a safe haven silver is a safe</text>
  <text start="563.24" dur="4.86">haven and the central bankers and the</text>
  <text start="565.97" dur="4.53">banking system the deep state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="568.1" dur="4.14">bringing it back down so people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="570.5" dur="5.73">notice what&amp;#39;s really going on here and</text>
  <text start="572.24" dur="7.05">you can see at this point that if you</text>
  <text start="576.23" dur="6.84">are not prepared at this time we are n</text>
  <text start="579.29" dur="7.41">ting entering a stage where everything</text>
  <text start="583.07" dur="4.98">is going to be in chaos and in the last</text>
  <text start="586.7" dur="5.009">couple of days you</text>
  <text start="588.05" dur="7.55">see how everything is in chaos and once</text>
  <text start="591.709" dur="6.75">again this is going to continue on and</text>
  <text start="595.6" dur="4.299">this could come down at any second I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="598.459" dur="3.541">not saying it&amp;#39;s going to at this point</text>
  <text start="599.899" dur="5.581">but you need to be ready and prepared if</text>
  <text start="602" dur="5.279">it does and we&amp;#39;ve been talking about the</text>
  <text start="605.48" dur="7.02">economy because we need to understand</text>
  <text start="607.279" dur="7.471">the economy is completely done the</text>
  <text start="612.5" dur="4.47">dollar is being rejected around the</text>
  <text start="614.75" dur="4.649">world countries are using crypto</text>
  <text start="616.97" dur="6.929">currencies or other currencies dealing</text>
  <text start="619.399" dur="5.611">outside of the dollar we understand that</text>
  <text start="623.899" dur="3.211">the velocity of money is going to be</text>
  <text start="625.01" dur="3.72">picking up we understand that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="627.11" dur="2.76">gonna be seeing inflation because all</text>
  <text start="628.73" dur="2.849">those dollars around the world are gonna</text>
  <text start="629.87" dur="3.87">come back to the United States more</text>
  <text start="631.579" dur="4.621">dollars in circulation means the</text>
  <text start="633.74" dur="4.92">currency is devalued which means we see</text>
  <text start="636.2" dur="3.75">inflation so all of these things</text>
  <text start="638.66" dur="1.95">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="639.95" dur="3.84">all along</text>
  <text start="640.61" dur="6.11">it&amp;#39;s all happening together at the same</text>
  <text start="643.79" dur="5.52">time so if you&amp;#39;ve been preparing</text>
  <text start="646.72" dur="5.17">continue to prepare if you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="649.31" dur="5.37">prepared as of yet I would get some food</text>
  <text start="651.89" dur="4.949">some water some plot and some supplies I</text>
  <text start="654.68" dur="4.349">would have gold or silver on hand maybe</text>
  <text start="656.839" dur="4.44">get purchase a couple crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="659.029" dur="4.711">if you can I would make sure that I had</text>
  <text start="661.279" dur="3.901">dollars on hand and just in case because</text>
  <text start="663.74" dur="3.48">you&amp;#39;re gonna need that in the beginning</text>
  <text start="665.18" dur="3.48">stages because no one&amp;#39;s gonna take you</text>
  <text start="667.22" dur="3.48">no gold you&amp;#39;re not be able to trade</text>
  <text start="668.66" dur="4.35">crypto currencies they&amp;#39;ll just take cash</text>
  <text start="670.7" dur="5.579">most likely in the beginning as the</text>
  <text start="673.01" dur="5.31">dollar loses value the cash will become</text>
  <text start="676.279" dur="4.771">worthless and then most like you will</text>
  <text start="678.32" dur="7.91">move into bartering but we can see right</text>
  <text start="681.05" dur="7.83">now there are two factions at work here</text>

  <text start="688.88" dur="5.79">they will crash the system hard and</text>
  <text start="691.57" dur="5.889">they&amp;#39;ll make everyone pay the price for</text>
  <text start="694.67" dur="6.539">what is being done to them then we have</text>
  <text start="697.459" dur="7.081">the soft transition where we&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="701.209" dur="5.82">to move to a new system because this</text>
  <text start="704.54" dur="5.1">system is done this is the deep state</text>
  <text start="707.029" dur="6.331">central bank system moving to a</text>
  <text start="709.64" dur="5.699">completely different system would be</text>
  <text start="713.36" dur="3.839">better for the people because most</text>
  <text start="715.339" dur="3.951">likely maybe will be a crypto system</text>
  <text start="717.199" dur="5.14">without the central bank</text>
  <text start="719.29" dur="6.84">and they&amp;#39;re trying to bring us down</text>
  <text start="722.339" dur="5.8">easily so it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt as many people</text>
  <text start="726.13" dur="4.35">compared to the deep state and the</text>
  <text start="728.139" dur="5.041">central bank where they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="730.48" dur="5.279">crash it so if they crash the market and</text>
  <text start="733.18" dur="4.8">the market comes down you know five</text>
  <text start="735.759" dur="5.13">thousand nine thousand ten thousand</text>
  <text start="737.98" dur="6.63">points we&amp;#39;re gonna see corporations</text>
  <text start="740.889" dur="7.38">layoffs am a huge number of people we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="744.61" dur="6.3">going to see cost-cutting we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="748.269" dur="4.891">see people in a lot of trouble we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="750.91" dur="4.229">going to see credit freeze up and again</text>
  <text start="753.16" dur="3.929">the deep state the sentiment they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="755.139" dur="3.991">care about that they don&amp;#39;t care what</text>
  <text start="757.089" dur="6.75">happens to the people they could care</text>
  <text start="759.13" dur="8.37">less so we&amp;#39;re in this phase right now</text>
  <text start="763.839" dur="6.06">in the chaos phase in this limbo phase</text>
  <text start="767.5" dur="3.81">where they&amp;#39;re battling it out right in</text>
  <text start="769.899" dur="3.99">front of us and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised</text>
  <text start="771.31" dur="4.23">if we wake up tomorrow morning maybe the</text>
  <text start="773.889" dur="4.64">market goes down a little bit and all of</text>
  <text start="775.54" dur="5.76">a sudden shoots back up to you know a</text>
  <text start="778.529" dur="4.631">positive number maybe even the same</text>
  <text start="781.3" dur="3.99">number that it dropped because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="783.16" dur="3.78">starting to see that to where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="785.29" dur="4.109">starting to see the Sun the numbers</text>
  <text start="786.94" dur="5.37">match it drops by you know by 567 points</text>
  <text start="789.399" dur="4.92">then it&amp;#39;s back up by 567 points we might</text>
  <text start="792.31" dur="3.779">see it drop you know as it did today by</text>
  <text start="794.319" dur="4.441">a thousand points we might see it back</text>
  <text start="796.089" dur="5.641">up by a thousand points to continually</text>
  <text start="798.76" dur="5.67">keep the market you know on an even</text>
  <text start="801.73" dur="4.799">playing field and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="804.43" dur="4.529">gonna try to do now in in in the minds</text>
  <text start="806.529" dur="4.29">of everyone out there they see the</text>
  <text start="808.959" dur="3.63">market go back up everyone is relieved</text>
  <text start="810.819" dur="3.421">everyone feels good when the market goes</text>
  <text start="812.589" dur="3.661">down everyone you know gets very nervous</text>
  <text start="814.24" dur="4.37">and terrified and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="816.25" dur="6.41">seeing right now now we&amp;#39;re coming up on</text>
  <text start="818.61" dur="7.15">the weekend and tomorrow&amp;#39;s Friday and</text>
  <text start="822.66" dur="5.799">normally what they do on a Friday they</text>
  <text start="825.76" dur="4.62">end on a good note that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="828.459" dur="3.301">normally have done in the past you go</text>
  <text start="830.38" dur="3.689">into the weekend you feel good</text>
  <text start="831.76" dur="5.67">everything is great you come out on</text>
  <text start="834.069" dur="4.311">Monday well things start to fall apart</text>
  <text start="837.43" dur="4.92">again</text>
  <text start="838.38" dur="5.29">this time it&amp;#39;s a little different the</text>
  <text start="842.35" dur="2.37">Trump administration with the plunge</text>
  <text start="843.67" dur="3.719">Protection Team and the high-frequency</text>
  <text start="844.72" dur="6.359">traders would like the market to be up</text>
  <text start="847.389" dur="5.341">on the weekend so everyone feels ok</text>
  <text start="851.079" dur="3.511">during the weekend</text>
  <text start="852.73" dur="4.65">the deep state the central bankers would</text>
  <text start="854.59" dur="5.85">like the market to be down now so</text>
  <text start="857.38" dur="5.43">everyone can feel the pain they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="860.44" dur="5.31">the opposite right now because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="862.81" dur="7.35">not in full control so if we see the</text>
  <text start="865.75" dur="7.08">market down another 300 400 500 points</text>
  <text start="870.16" dur="5.52">we know the deep state they have done</text>
  <text start="872.83" dur="6.51">this if we see the market up we know</text>
  <text start="875.68" dur="6.03">that Trump has gained ground they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="879.34" dur="5.73">able to use the plunge protection team</text>
  <text start="881.71" dur="5.01">to push the market back up and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="885.07" dur="4.53">gonna go through this weekend feeling</text>
  <text start="886.72" dur="5.52">good and most likely on Monday the deep</text>
  <text start="889.6" dur="4.32">state will bring it back down so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="892.24" dur="4.14">see what happens here but we can see</text>
  <text start="893.92" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;re gonna see this play out going</text>
  <text start="896.38" dur="4.89">through the end of this week going to</text>
  <text start="898.57" dur="7.1">the next week and this is the stock</text>
  <text start="901.27" dur="7.11">market war we are watching right now but</text>
  <text start="905.67" dur="5.92">besides what is happening in the market</text>
  <text start="908.38" dur="6.45">the economy is still falling apart it</text>
  <text start="911.59" dur="6.6">has been for a very long time the debt</text>
  <text start="914.83" dur="6.21">levels are too high people have been</text>
  <text start="918.19" dur="7.14">losing jobs the quality of jobs not</text>
  <text start="921.04" dur="7.71">there and everything is manipulated so</text>
  <text start="925.33" dur="5.16">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the real</text>
  <text start="928.75" dur="4.02">economy which we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on</text>
  <text start="930.49" dur="4.68">the people&amp;#39;s economy it&amp;#39;s still falling</text>
  <text start="932.77" dur="4.65">apart that hasn&amp;#39;t changed the only thing</text>
  <text start="935.17" dur="6.24">that we&amp;#39;re watching right now is the</text>
  <text start="937.42" dur="7.83">signal to let everyone know the economy</text>
  <text start="941.41" dur="7.08">failed to give corporations excuses to</text>
  <text start="945.25" dur="6.24">lay off people to give banks excuses to</text>
  <text start="948.49" dur="8.28">go after your funds inside of the bank</text>
  <text start="951.49" dur="8.37">called balance that&amp;#39;s it so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="956.77" dur="6.99">watching most likely the end stage of</text>
  <text start="959.86" dur="5.61">this unless unless the Trump</text>
  <text start="963.76" dur="4.71">administration can take control of it</text>
  <text start="965.47" dur="5.97">and we can see right now the deep state</text>
  <text start="968.47" dur="4.77">the cabal the central banks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="971.44" dur="5.4">gonna do whatever they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="973.24" dur="6.48">keep everyone looking at the market</text>
  <text start="976.84" dur="7.23">instead of the news that is coming out</text>
  <text start="979.72" dur="6.63">and this is a big distraction game but</text>
  <text start="984.07" dur="4.23">no matter what you&amp;#39;re gonna need to be</text>
  <text start="986.35" dur="3.93">because we don&amp;#39;t know which way this is</text>
