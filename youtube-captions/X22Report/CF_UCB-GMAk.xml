  <text start="107.95" dur="5.85">in the green they pushed it up they</text>
  <text start="110.53" dur="7.05">pushed it up and it&amp;#39;s getting harder and</text>
  <text start="113.8" dur="5.91">harder for them to do this because what</text>
  <text start="117.58" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;re really seeing is that these</text>
  <text start="119.71" dur="6.36">economic indicators that are coming out</text>
  <text start="122.32" dur="6.99">for construction for retail from</text>
  <text start="126.07" dur="7.47">corporations their balance sheets from</text>
  <text start="129.31" dur="7.41">banks these indicators show us that the</text>
  <text start="133.54" dur="5.4">economy is not doing as well as the</text>
  <text start="136.72" dur="5.25">government has been leading us to</text>
  <text start="138.94" dur="7.04">believe I mean right now we see that</text>
  <text start="141.97" dur="7.17">retail stocks they have been plunging</text>
  <text start="145.98" dur="5.02">despite that what the government has</text>
  <text start="149.14" dur="4.65">been telling us they&amp;#39;ve been telling us</text>
  <text start="151" dur="4.47">that you know wage growth is on the rise</text>
  <text start="153.79" dur="4.55">of course what&amp;#39;s happening with wage</text>
  <text start="155.47" dur="5.61">growth is the government is continually</text>
  <text start="158.34" dur="5.59">increasing the salaries of the</text>
  <text start="161.08" dur="7.37">government worker the private sector</text>
  <text start="163.93" dur="11.789">wages are continually falling and the</text>
  <text start="168.45" dur="8.95">retail sales are in decline and what</text>
  <text start="175.719" dur="3.511">we&amp;#39;re seeing as we approach this holiday</text>
  <text start="177.4" dur="4.589">season is that it&amp;#39;s not getting any</text>
  <text start="179.23" dur="7.11">better right now banana republic is</text>
  <text start="181.989" dur="8.791">seeing a fifteen percent decline in</text>
  <text start="186.34" dur="8.849">sales gap is down four percent already I</text>
  <text start="190.78" dur="11.159">mean we&amp;#39;ve seen this before if we go</text>
  <text start="195.189" dur="8.91">back to 2008 we see that the retail</text>
  <text start="201.939" dur="5.55">sector was climbing climbing climbing</text>
  <text start="204.099" dur="8.191">and then all of a sudden it completely</text>
  <text start="207.489" dur="7.741">fell apart in construction framing</text>
  <text start="212.29" dur="6.779">lumber prices have crashed over twenty</text>
  <text start="215.23" dur="6.539">one percent year-over-year now it seems</text>
  <text start="219.069" dur="4.26">very odd that the construction jobs</text>
  <text start="221.769" dur="4.381">would keep surging onwards and upwards</text>
  <text start="223.329" dur="4.77">as if nothing had happened now of course</text>
  <text start="226.15" dur="5.64">we know the government is funding a lot</text>
  <text start="228.099" dur="6.17">of this and we know that they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="231.79" dur="6.659">a lot of free money to continually build</text>
  <text start="234.269" dur="6.131">we know a lot of hedge funds investment</text>
  <text start="238.449" dur="4.231">companies foreign investors are getting</text>
  <text start="240.4" dur="5.579">this free money to continually purchase</text>
  <text start="242.68" dur="7.35">but things don&amp;#39;t really make sense they</text>
  <text start="245.979" dur="7.141">don&amp;#39;t add up so when we look at the</text>
  <text start="250.03" dur="5.639">retail and we look at construction these</text>
  <text start="253.12" dur="4.47">sectors are decoupling from what the</text>
  <text start="255.669" dur="6.601">government is continually trying to sell</text>
  <text start="257.59" dur="8.069">us and that&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re in recovery and when</text>
  <text start="262.27" dur="8.7">we see this we see that everything right</text>
  <text start="265.659" dur="7.5">now in the economy is turning down now</text>
  <text start="270.97" dur="3.96">the US government central bankers they</text>
  <text start="273.159" dur="4.141">are having a very difficult time with</text>
  <text start="274.93" dur="3.9">this because as you know in the past</text>
  <text start="277.3" dur="3.929">during the winter months they always say</text>
  <text start="278.83" dur="6.119">well the reason why retail and</text>
  <text start="281.229" dur="6.12">construction and real estate and job</text>
  <text start="284.949" dur="4.321">openings and all that other stuff it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="287.349" dur="4.5">the weather people couldn&amp;#39;t get out</text>
  <text start="289.27" dur="4.079">there it was too snowy and they always</text>
  <text start="291.849" dur="2.581">seemed to blame it on the weather they</text>
  <text start="293.349" dur="4.051">blame everything on the weather I mean</text>
  <text start="294.43" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re blaming that they couldn&amp;#39;t hit</text>
  <text start="297.4" dur="3.03">these</text>
  <text start="297.76" dur="5.28">lamech state in Syria and Iraq because</text>
  <text start="300.43" dur="6.11">of the weather meanwhile Russia has no</text>
  <text start="303.04" dur="6.57">problem whatsoever so here in the States</text>
  <text start="306.54" dur="5.89">the US government the central bankers</text>
  <text start="309.61" dur="5.1">the corporate media they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="312.43" dur="5.48">get all their excuses ready of why</text>
  <text start="314.71" dur="6.84">things are not going that well right now</text>
  <text start="317.91" dur="7.57">citibank is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="321.55" dur="7.26">blaming what has been going on here in</text>
  <text start="325.48" dur="7.32">the united states on the weather they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="328.81" dur="7.23">blaming warm weather for poor october</text>
  <text start="332.8" dur="6.39">retail sales yes you heard me correctly</text>
  <text start="336.04" dur="8.1">it is the weather it&amp;#39;s just been too</text>
  <text start="339.19" dur="7.41">warm to sunny I mean this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="344.14" dur="4.89">ridiculous at this point now we</text>
  <text start="346.6" dur="5.85">understand retail sales have been</text>
  <text start="349.03" dur="7.98">declining we understand that the trend</text>
  <text start="352.45" dur="6.48">now is downward and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="357.01" dur="7.04">because of these strange weather</text>
  <text start="358.93" dur="8.52">patterns we&amp;#39;re seeing all these strange</text>
  <text start="364.05" dur="6.25">retail sales we&amp;#39;re seeing construction</text>
  <text start="367.45" dur="6.57">not going as well how is in turning down</text>
  <text start="370.3" dur="6.78">and when you look at the average</text>
  <text start="374.02" dur="6.69">temperature throughout the years as</text>
  <text start="377.08" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re saying that it&amp;#39;s too warm and we</text>
  <text start="380.71" dur="7.07">go back let&amp;#39;s say two 2014 the average</text>
  <text start="383.47" dur="6.57">temperature was around 56 degrees in</text>
  <text start="387.78" dur="7">2015 in October the average temperature</text>
  <text start="390.04" dur="9.99">was around 57 degrees and if we go back</text>
  <text start="394.78" dur="9.36">to 2013 it was 54 degrees 2012 it was 54</text>
  <text start="400.03" dur="6.21">degrees so it really doesn&amp;#39;t fit and</text>
  <text start="404.14" dur="4.65">what they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re just making</text>
  <text start="406.24" dur="5.42">things up because they don&amp;#39;t want to let</text>
  <text start="408.79" dur="6.24">on on what&amp;#39;s really going on here and</text>
  <text start="411.66" dur="4.81">that is the economy if you notice every</text>
  <text start="415.03" dur="5.04">time they talk about all the stuff</text>
  <text start="416.47" dur="7.29">unemployment retail construction housing</text>
  <text start="420.07" dur="5.91">sales GDP they always try to make</text>
  <text start="423.76" dur="7.31">everyone look in a different direction</text>
  <text start="425.98" dur="7.07">and that direction is not at the economy</text>
  <text start="431.07" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re already getting their excuses</text>
  <text start="433.05" dur="5.25">ready for this holiday season they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="436.35" dur="4.68">going to blame it on warm weather if</text>
  <text start="438.3" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s oddly warm during this holiday</text>
  <text start="441.03" dur="6.09">season they&amp;#39;re going to blame it on a</text>
  <text start="443.34" dur="6.24">late thanksgiving if it&amp;#39;s rainy they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="447.12" dur="5.07">blame it on rain if there&amp;#39;s no snow</text>
  <text start="449.58" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;ll say it&amp;#39;s lack of snow if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="452.19" dur="3.63">too much snow they&amp;#39;ll say it&amp;#39;s too much</text>
  <text start="453.84" dur="5.13">snow out there and they&amp;#39;ll continually</text>
  <text start="455.82" dur="8.31">use these excuses to explain away all</text>
  <text start="458.97" dur="7.56">this bad data but we know the truth it</text>
  <text start="464.13" dur="5.1">has nothing to do with the weather it</text>
  <text start="466.53" dur="6.06">has to do with the economy and how this</text>
  <text start="469.23" dur="7.2">entire system is completely falling</text>
  <text start="472.59" dur="6.54">apart I mean we look at the housing</text>
  <text start="476.43" dur="4.8">market right now we&amp;#39;re out of the season</text>
  <text start="479.13" dur="3.9">which is supposed to be incredible which</text>
  <text start="481.23" dur="4.11">is the summer season usually spring and</text>
  <text start="483.03" dur="4.89">summer flowers are blooming the warm</text>
  <text start="485.34" dur="4.56">weathers in housing is supposed to take</text>
  <text start="487.92" dur="3.48">off people are in the mood they want to</text>
  <text start="489.9" dur="3.72">get into their house before school</text>
  <text start="491.4" dur="5.39">starts well now we&amp;#39;re past the summer</text>
  <text start="493.62" dur="6.93">we&amp;#39;re moving into the winter months here</text>
  <text start="496.79" dur="6.91">we&amp;#39;re in the middle of fall and housing</text>
  <text start="500.55" dur="4.74">is continually declining mortgage</text>
  <text start="503.7" dur="7.02">applications are continually declining</text>
  <text start="505.29" dur="8.7">and home prices are falling right now</text>
  <text start="510.72" dur="6.06">because the bubble is getting ready to</text>
  <text start="513.99" dur="5.97">pop and there are more and more</text>
  <text start="516.78" dur="5.34">businesses laying off and as we have</text>
  <text start="519.96" dur="3.99">more layoffs that means people are going</text>
  <text start="522.12" dur="4.68">to lose their homes people are going to</text>
  <text start="523.95" dur="5.13">lose their cars people are not going to</text>
  <text start="526.8" dur="5.54">be making payments on their credit cards</text>
  <text start="529.08" dur="6.02">and they&amp;#39;ll be taking a part-time work</text>
  <text start="532.34" dur="6.01">because it is very difficult to find</text>
  <text start="535.1" dur="5.65">full-time work we already know that</text>
  <text start="538.35" dur="5.43">Freddie and Fannie they&amp;#39;re looking for a</text>
  <text start="540.75" dur="6.05">four hundred billion dollar bailout</text>
  <text start="543.78" dur="6.54">right now they&amp;#39;re a little short and</text>
  <text start="546.8" dur="6.25">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that Freddie</text>
  <text start="550.32" dur="7.38">Mac is subsidizing the real estate</text>
  <text start="553.05" dur="8.67">transaction for billionaires now how are</text>
  <text start="557.7" dur="7.11">they doing this well there are certain</text>
  <text start="561.72" dur="6.15">organizations out there like the blacks</text>
  <text start="564.81" dur="5.19">group there in talks with Freddie Mac to</text>
  <text start="567.87" dur="5.07">finance all different types of</text>
  <text start="570" dur="7.02">transaction and their totalling about 10</text>
  <text start="572.94" dur="6.75">billion dollars and as time goes on from</text>
  <text start="577.02" dur="5.7">2008 to the present Freddie Mac&amp;#39;s deals</text>
  <text start="579.69" dur="5.37">are getting bigger and bigger as its</text>
  <text start="582.72" dur="4.89">regulators as regulator expands the</text>
  <text start="585.06" dur="5.76">definition of affordable housing because</text>
  <text start="587.61" dur="4.979">what Freddie Mac is supposed to do they</text>
  <text start="590.82" dur="3.93">have this program known as the eb-5</text>
  <text start="592.589" dur="4.381">which enables foreign nationals to</text>
  <text start="594.75" dur="4.17">obtain us permanent resident status by</text>
  <text start="596.97" dur="5.13">putting up money for new business</text>
  <text start="598.92" dur="5.58">ventures that create American jobs it</text>
  <text start="602.1" dur="4.71">gives ventures in high unemployment and</text>
  <text start="604.5" dur="4.71">rural areas a special status to</text>
  <text start="606.81" dur="4.71">encourage investment but as the</text>
  <text start="609.21" dur="5.1">program&amp;#39;s popularity has soared in</text>
  <text start="611.52" dur="6.72">recent years the bulk of immigrant</text>
  <text start="614.31" dur="8.79">investment is going to projects that are</text>
  <text start="618.24" dur="7.02">not located in areas where they might be</text>
  <text start="623.1" dur="8.04">where they might be depressed they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="625.26" dur="10.56">going into areas where the neighborhoods</text>
  <text start="631.14" dur="8.91">are prosperous so what I&amp;#39;m saying is</text>
  <text start="635.82" dur="7.29">that at least eighty percent of the eb-5</text>
  <text start="640.05" dur="6.92">money is going to projects that wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="643.11" dur="7.62">qualify as being in targeted employment</text>
  <text start="646.97" dur="6.46">areas basically what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="650.73" dur="7.74">they&amp;#39;re using this money right now to a</text>
  <text start="653.43" dur="9.51">build um multi-family homes apartment</text>
  <text start="658.47" dur="6.99">rentals and the billionaires are using</text>
  <text start="662.94" dur="7.49">this money and they&amp;#39;re building these</text>
  <text start="665.46" dur="7.08">homes in areas that are not depressed</text>
  <text start="670.43" dur="6.159">that they&amp;#39;re not going to be bringing in</text>
  <text start="672.54" dur="10.169">foreign workers they&amp;#39;re just doing it to</text>
  <text start="676.589" dur="8.94">build housing the money appears to be</text>
  <text start="682.709" dur="6.051">flowing to the flashiest projects which</text>
  <text start="685.529" dur="6.031">the investors office see as the safest</text>
  <text start="688.76" dur="6.01">among those getting the eb-5 money are</text>
  <text start="691.56" dur="7.13">an office building set to host Facebook</text>
  <text start="694.77" dur="7.1">near Amazon in Seattle</text>

  <text start="727.96" dur="7.27">they&amp;#39;re not doing this it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="733.22" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re building this for the wealthy</text>
  <text start="735.23" dur="6.48">and they&amp;#39;re using the taxpayer funds to</text>
  <text start="738.29" dur="8.06">do this and this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing all</text>
  <text start="741.71" dur="7.74">of this construction all over the place</text>
  <text start="746.35" dur="6.1">it&amp;#39;s just unbelievable the amount of</text>

  <text start="776.75" dur="6.18">now remember if china&amp;#39;s exports are</text>
  <text start="780.58" dur="4.99">falling and their factories aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="782.93" dur="4.98">producing that means the private western</text>
  <text start="785.57" dur="5.16">central bank countries the wealthy</text>
  <text start="787.91" dur="6.45">countries they&amp;#39;re not purchasing the</text>
  <text start="790.73" dur="7.2">question is why but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="794.36" dur="5.1">here is that in october chinese exports</text>
  <text start="797.93" dur="4.23">were down six point nine percent</text>
  <text start="799.46" dur="5.82">compared to a year ago that&amp;#39;s strange</text>
  <text start="802.16" dur="4.44">they should be going up because you know</text>
  <text start="805.28" dur="2.49">the United States their unemployment is</text>
  <text start="806.6" dur="3.21">that five percent more people are</text>
  <text start="807.77" dur="4.47">working we should be ordering like crazy</text>
  <text start="809.81" dur="3.87">we should be out in the malls purchasing</text>
  <text start="812.24" dur="5.25">like there&amp;#39;s no tomorrow but guess what</text>
  <text start="813.68" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s not happening and that&amp;#39;s following</text>
  <text start="817.49" dur="4.98">a decline of three point seven percent</text>
  <text start="819.56" dur="4.86">in the September the only time Chinese</text>
  <text start="822.47" dur="7.58">trade numbers have been this bad for</text>
  <text start="824.42" dur="8.13">this long was during 2008 and 2009 and</text>
  <text start="830.05" dur="6.55">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="832.55" dur="7.62">is a crippling global recession that has</text>
  <text start="836.6" dur="6.989">arrived I mean demand for Chinese steel</text>
  <text start="840.17" dur="5.57">is down eight point nine percent China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="843.589" dur="4.981">rail freight volume is down ten percent</text>
  <text start="845.74" dur="5.529">South Korean exports are down fifteen</text>
  <text start="848.57" dur="7.17">point eight percent according to the</text>
  <text start="851.269" dur="6.57">Dutch government index a year ago global</text>
  <text start="855.74" dur="5.94">trade in primary commodities was sitting</text>
  <text start="857.839" dur="7.021">at a number of about a hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="861.68" dur="6.63">but now it has fallen all the way down</text>
  <text start="864.86" dur="5.28">to 114 what this means is that less</text>
  <text start="868.31" dur="4.62">commodities are being traded around the</text>
  <text start="870.14" dur="6.06">world and that is very it&amp;#39;s a very clear</text>
  <text start="872.93" dur="7.92">sign that this global economic activity</text>
  <text start="876.2" dur="8.22">is coming to a screeching halt now</text>
  <text start="880.85" dur="6.96">according to CEO the world&amp;#39;s economy is</text>
  <text start="884.42" dur="6.09">growing at a slower pace than the IMF</text>
  <text start="887.81" dur="5.58">and other lords the large forecasters</text>
  <text start="890.51" dur="7.319">are predicting and what he&amp;#39;s saying is</text>
  <text start="893.39" dur="7.92">that the IMF is off on their forecasts</text>
  <text start="897.829" dur="6.481">which they normally are and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="901.31" dur="4.589">starting to see this happen and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="904.31" dur="4.14">accelerating it&amp;#39;s not getting any better</text>
  <text start="905.899" dur="6.841">so these job numbers that we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="908.45" dur="7.02">here in the United States can&amp;#39;t be true</text>
  <text start="912.74" dur="4.86">because the American people are not</text>
  <text start="915.47" dur="3.54">going out to purchase goods if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="917.6" dur="2.94">not going out to purchase goods the</text>
  <text start="919.01" dur="3.3">manufacturers the factories don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="920.54" dur="3.299">to produce if the factories don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="922.31" dur="3.57">to produce they don&amp;#39;t need the raw</text>
  <text start="923.839" dur="4.56">material and guess what the bolt that</text>
  <text start="925.88" dur="4.86">dry index is falling once again down six</text>
  <text start="928.399" dur="5.011">points to 622 and this is the raw</text>
  <text start="930.74" dur="6.74">material the factories use this is a</text>
  <text start="933.41" dur="6.83">gauge of how we are doing right now</text>
  <text start="937.48" dur="6.79">Moody&amp;#39;s is saying and they&amp;#39;re warning</text>
  <text start="940.24" dur="7.39">that global policy makers lack the tools</text>
  <text start="944.27" dur="6.39">to deal with any unexpected negative</text>
  <text start="947.63" dur="6.389">economic shock so if there are something</text>
  <text start="950.66" dur="8.34">unexpected like black swan or some type</text>
  <text start="954.019" dur="6.81">of an event this whole economy will come</text>
  <text start="959" dur="5.25">crumbling down they have nothing to</text>
  <text start="960.829" dur="5.021">fight it the Fed is saying that US banks</text>
  <text start="964.25" dur="4.839">are not sound</text>
  <text start="965.85" dur="6.09">they need additional capital around</text>
  <text start="969.089" dur="6.571">three-point-nine percent worth now</text>
  <text start="971.94" dur="8.399">remember banks right now only keep one</text>
  <text start="975.66" dur="7.349">to three percent in their in their</text>
  <text start="980.339" dur="8.37">system which means this is how much cash</text>
  <text start="983.009" dur="9.031">they have and if there was a run on the</text>
  <text start="988.709" dur="6.901">banks guess what they will not have</text>
  <text start="992.04" dur="6.33">enough physical cash banks would</text>
  <text start="995.61" dur="6.75">completely seized up because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="998.37" dur="5.519">have the funds on hand and right now</text>

  <text start="1003.889" dur="7.081">trillion and we know at this point in</text>
  <text start="1007.97" dur="4.799">the game they&amp;#39;re not going to be able to</text>
  <text start="1010.97" dur="5.16">raise this amount before this collapse</text>
  <text start="1012.769" dur="6.57">hits it is completely impossible and</text>
  <text start="1016.13" dur="6.03">they know it and this is why they have</text>
  <text start="1019.339" dur="5.391">the bail and documents this is why</text>
