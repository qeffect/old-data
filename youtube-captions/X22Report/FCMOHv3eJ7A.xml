  <text start="53.24" dur="4.92">hi and welcome you listening to the ex</text>
  <text start="56.51" dur="5.28">when he to report my name is Dave and</text>
  <text start="58.16" dur="6.3">this is episode 1663 a.m. today&amp;#39;s date</text>
  <text start="61.79" dur="5.46">is September 13th 2018 and the thought</text>
  <text start="64.46" dur="6.57">of the episode is the economic crisis is</text>
  <text start="67.25" dur="6.09">on schedule let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="71.03" dur="5.25">collapse financial news now let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="73.34" dur="5.58">about this schedule of this economic</text>
  <text start="76.28" dur="5.01">collapse because the central bankers</text>
  <text start="78.92" dur="4.5">before Trump came into office they had a</text>
  <text start="81.29" dur="4.05">schedule they knew when the collapse was</text>
  <text start="83.42" dur="3.39">going to be they knew how it was going</text>
  <text start="85.34" dur="3.84">to happen that he knew they were going</text>
  <text start="86.81" dur="5.58">to have an event all they needed these</text>
  <text start="89.18" dur="5.82">is all the pieces in place well that</text>
  <text start="92.39" dur="5.28">didn&amp;#39;t happen so what do you do with the</text>
  <text start="95" dur="8.21">schedule because we need to understand</text>
  <text start="97.67" dur="9">and remember that the economy was only</text>
  <text start="103.21" dur="5.89">designed to last a certain period of</text>
  <text start="106.67" dur="4.5">time and then it collapses because as</text>
  <text start="109.1" dur="4.23">you continually create currency and put</text>
  <text start="111.17" dur="4.71">the country into debt and people into</text>
  <text start="113.33" dur="4.17">debt and you lose jobs and the move</text>
  <text start="115.88" dur="5.099">manufacturing out of the United States</text>
  <text start="117.5" dur="6.33">and you lose jobs and the federal tax</text>
  <text start="120.979" dur="4.471">receipts decline over time it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="123.83" dur="3.27">matter of time before the economy</text>
  <text start="125.45" dur="3.479">implodes by itself you only have to do</text>
  <text start="127.1" dur="3.659">anything and the central bankers know</text>
  <text start="128.929" dur="4.531">this they know that their system is</text>
  <text start="130.759" dur="5.491">flawed and when I say flawed I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="133.46" dur="4.5">mean oh there&amp;#39;s problems and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="136.25" dur="3.93">know what to do with it it&amp;#39;s flawed in a</text>
  <text start="137.96" dur="5.04">way where it doesn&amp;#39;t benefit the people</text>
  <text start="140.18" dur="4.26">it benefits the central bank and it only</text>
  <text start="143" dur="3.569">benefits the central bank up to a</text>
  <text start="144.44" dur="5.01">certain point of time and they need to</text>
  <text start="146.569" dur="5.221">restart it this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="149.45" dur="4.92">right now the flaw is is they</text>
  <text start="151.79" dur="4.38">continually create currency out of thin</text>
  <text start="154.37" dur="4.38">air they loan it to governments there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="156.17" dur="6">interest attached to it and since that</text>
  <text start="158.75" dur="6.36">first printing of that first dollar you</text>
  <text start="162.17" dur="4.71">owe more on that dollar than exists out</text>
  <text start="165.11" dur="4.44">in the real world because they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="166.88" dur="4.98">created it yet so they create one dollar</text>
  <text start="169.55" dur="4.56">and now the government owes them let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="171.86" dur="5.43">say a dollar plus ten cents interest</text>
  <text start="174.11" dur="5.19">where do you get the 10 cents it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="177.29" dur="4.59">exist so what do you have to do you have</text>
  <text start="179.3" dur="4.92">to borrow more can you ever pay down the</text>
  <text start="181.88" dur="4.29">debt no it&amp;#39;s completely impossible you</text>
  <text start="184.22" dur="5.64">can&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="186.17" dur="8.66">is the flaw and as time goes on what</text>
  <text start="189.86" dur="8.489">happens the debt gets larger the jobs</text>
  <text start="194.83" dur="6.1">decrease people are put into debt</text>
  <text start="198.349" dur="6.331">they don&amp;#39;t have cash on hand their</text>
  <text start="200.93" dur="5.16">entire lives revolve around debt that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="204.68" dur="3.72">it that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing today and</text>
  <text start="206.09" dur="4.38">yes those people who started in the</text>
  <text start="208.4" dur="4.05">beginning of the system they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="210.47" dur="5.34">make out a lot better than those people</text>
  <text start="212.45" dur="6.319">coming into the system in the late 90s</text>
  <text start="215.81" dur="5.7">2000s and the where we are today</text>
  <text start="218.769" dur="5.021">actually people coming in today it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="221.51" dur="6.059">very very difficult because you&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="223.79" dur="6.15">the end stage of this system those</text>
  <text start="227.569" dur="4.741">people who were getting jobs in the 70s</text>
  <text start="229.94" dur="4.53">or even the early 80s that it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="232.31" dur="5.73">beginning stages of a central bank</text>
  <text start="234.47" dur="7.16">system so you have the ability to ride</text>
  <text start="238.04" dur="7.59">out their system throughout time and</text>
  <text start="241.63" dur="7.3">prosper from it while others well they</text>
  <text start="245.63" dur="5.52">lose everything and as more people come</text>
  <text start="248.93" dur="3.779">into the central banking system and what</text>
  <text start="251.15" dur="3.99">I mean by that is they&amp;#39;re born they grow</text>
  <text start="252.709" dur="5.191">up they get a job and they come into 90s</text>
  <text start="255.14" dur="4.8">and they come into 2000s these people</text>
  <text start="257.9" dur="6.06">have a tougher and tougher time because</text>
  <text start="259.94" dur="8.52">think about it the same dollar loses</text>
  <text start="263.96" dur="6.84">value over time so back in the day in</text>
  <text start="268.46" dur="3.9">the 70s you would go and you spend you</text>
  <text start="270.8" dur="4.26">know a dollar and you&amp;#39;ll be able to buy</text>
  <text start="272.36" dur="4.11">you know a lot more things then you can</text>
  <text start="275.06" dur="3.12">purchase today with the Delta actually</text>
  <text start="276.47" dur="4.83">can hardly purchase anything for a</text>
  <text start="278.18" dur="5.4">dollar because the value of that dollar</text>
  <text start="281.3" dur="4.89">has decreased so you need more of that</text>
  <text start="283.58" dur="5.28">dollar to buy the same amount of items</text>
  <text start="286.19" dur="5.01">and this is why people are having a</text>
  <text start="288.86" dur="3.69">difficult time today and this is why we</text>
  <text start="291.2" dur="4.23">move through many many different stages</text>
  <text start="292.55" dur="4.32">throughout the 70s when we came off the</text>
  <text start="295.43" dur="3.53">gold standard onto the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="296.87" dur="4.29">system this is why we went through</text>
  <text start="298.96" dur="4.45">financing a car instead of just buying</text>
  <text start="301.16" dur="4.44">it using cash this is why we went to</text>
  <text start="303.41" dur="4.71">leasing this is why they extended the</text>
  <text start="305.6" dur="4.11">time that you can pay it back this is</text>
  <text start="308.12" dur="3.62">why they had to bring in subprime people</text>
  <text start="309.71" dur="4.32">because over time the system</text>
  <text start="311.74" dur="4.81">deteriorates and there&amp;#39;s no way to keep</text>
  <text start="314.03" dur="5.249">it going so you have to use all these</text>
  <text start="316.55" dur="5.819">different fancy ways of can</text>
  <text start="319.279" dur="5.79">the system as the system breaks down and</text>
  <text start="322.369" dur="4.41">it becomes impossible and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="325.069" dur="4.32">seeing right now is the housing market</text>
  <text start="326.779" dur="4.56">which has been pumped up once again it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="329.389" dur="4.59">starting to fall apart actually if we</text>
  <text start="331.339" dur="5.31">look at Las Vegas right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="333.979" dur="5.58">cysts their entire real estate market</text>
  <text start="336.649" dur="5.16">has been pumped up and prices are up</text>
  <text start="339.559" dur="5.94">more than 135 percent from the depths of</text>
  <text start="341.809" dur="7.05">the crisis in North Las Vegas mortgage</text>
  <text start="345.499" dur="6.24">rates are rising and the bubble there is</text>
  <text start="348.859" dur="4.98">going to pop just like we&amp;#39;ve seen in</text>
  <text start="351.739" dur="3.96">many other places we&amp;#39;re going to see it</text>
  <text start="353.839" dur="4.26">in Phoenix we&amp;#39;re gonna see in LA we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="355.699" dur="3.99">gonna see in certain cities in Texas</text>
  <text start="358.099" dur="2.4">we&amp;#39;re gonna see in New York City we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="359.689" dur="3.5">gonna see it in all these different</text>
  <text start="360.499" dur="5.82">places where they look at the 20 cities</text>
  <text start="363.189" dur="5.59">they pumped up the bubbles there and now</text>
  <text start="366.319" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="368.779" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;re seeing cracks everywhere and when</text>
  <text start="370.399" dur="5.1">the Fed raises rates once again guess</text>
  <text start="373.159" dur="5.37">what it&amp;#39;s just gonna get worse and</text>
  <text start="375.499" dur="5.91">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going to see so the</text>
  <text start="378.529" dur="6.92">central bank system was always scheduled</text>
  <text start="381.409" dur="6.81">to come down during a certain period and</text>
  <text start="385.449" dur="6.52">now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that their</text>
  <text start="388.219" dur="7.22">schedule is still moving forward they</text>
  <text start="391.969" dur="6.81">don&amp;#39;t have that event so what do they do</text>
  <text start="395.439" dur="5.68">there&amp;#39;s not much they can do they can</text>
  <text start="398.779" dur="4.8">blame it on maybe Trump they can try to</text>
  <text start="401.119" dur="4.62">blame it on someone else but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="403.579" dur="3.93">stuck right now and this is a problem</text>
  <text start="405.739" dur="4.35">for them we&amp;#39;ll talk about that in a</text>
  <text start="407.509" dur="5.16">little while but I wanted to point our</text>
  <text start="410.089" dur="6.78">attention to the federal government</text>
  <text start="412.669" dur="6.26">receipts now what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing over</text>
  <text start="416.869" dur="5.1">time is that the federal government</text>
  <text start="418.929" dur="6.25">receipts coming into the government has</text>
  <text start="421.969" dur="5.19">been declining since the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="425.179" dur="3.57">now it dipped down quite a bit like</text>
  <text start="427.159" dur="3.54">down- 20 percent when everyone was</text>
  <text start="428.749" dur="6.03">getting laid off and then it was pumped</text>
  <text start="430.699" dur="7.32">back up and ever since around 2011-2012</text>
  <text start="434.779" dur="6.06">the government receipts have been</text>
  <text start="438.019" dur="5.64">falling and falling and falling at one</text>
  <text start="440.839" dur="4.44">point it touched into negative area then</text>
  <text start="443.659" dur="3.39">it will moved up a little bit now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="445.279" dur="4.53">almost back into the negative area once</text>
  <text start="447.049" dur="4.89">again and this is why they created fact</text>
  <text start="449.809" dur="2.911">Gattaca and the rest because they were</text>
  <text start="451.939" dur="2.971">looking for</text>
  <text start="452.72" dur="6.45">these funds everywhere around the world</text>
  <text start="454.91" dur="6.12">to keep the system moving along well at</text>
  <text start="459.17" dur="3.48">this point the number of people that are</text>
  <text start="461.03" dur="3.09">out of work the number of people that</text>
  <text start="462.65" dur="2.88">have gone from a full-time job to a</text>
  <text start="464.12" dur="3.33">part-time job because they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="465.53" dur="4.5">that full-time job you&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="467.45" dur="4.2">have the same tax receipts and no this</text>
  <text start="470.03" dur="4.83">is not because of Trump&amp;#39;s tax plan</text>
  <text start="471.65" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;ve been falling way before that go</text>
  <text start="474.86" dur="4.38">back to 2013 2014 2015</text>
  <text start="477.92" dur="4.95">actually they were in the negative</text>
  <text start="479.24" dur="6.48">territory in 2015 they pumped up a</text>
  <text start="482.87" dur="5.67">little bit to like 1% and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="485.72" dur="5.1">back almost to zero so we can see that</text>
  <text start="488.54" dur="5.34">has nothing to do with it what it really</text>
  <text start="490.82" dur="4.47">has to do with is the economy&amp;#39;s breaking</text>
  <text start="493.88" dur="2.94">down people don&amp;#39;t have jobs people</text>
  <text start="495.29" dur="4.53">aren&amp;#39;t making the same amount of money</text>
  <text start="496.82" dur="6.06">and we&amp;#39;re not seeing the taxes being</text>
  <text start="499.82" dur="4.86">pushed into the government what else is</text>
  <text start="502.88" dur="3.81">happening well the debt is continually</text>
  <text start="504.68" dur="4.26">rising in the government and the tax</text>
  <text start="506.69" dur="4.56">receipts are falling this is not a good</text>
  <text start="508.94" dur="4.74">sign what happens when this happens we</text>
  <text start="511.25" dur="4.8">have problems so everything is on</text>
  <text start="513.68" dur="5.09">schedule right now but the central bank</text>
  <text start="516.05" dur="5.929">they&amp;#39;re the ones that are in trouble</text>
  <text start="518.77" dur="6.01">because they didn&amp;#39;t have their event and</text>
  <text start="521.979" dur="5.921">we can see and if we look back in time</text>
  <text start="524.78" dur="6.059">we can see back in 2001 there was a</text>
  <text start="527.9" dur="5.88">dot-com bubble that popped and the</text>
  <text start="530.839" dur="5.911">markets came down in 2008 we saw the</text>
  <text start="533.78" dur="6.39">housing bubble that popped and that came</text>
  <text start="536.75" dur="6.45">down we are now in the same central</text>
  <text start="540.17" dur="7.83">bankers bubble and that is twice as</text>
  <text start="543.2" dur="5.639">large as the housing bubble what does</text>
  <text start="548" dur="5.4">that mean</text>
  <text start="548.839" dur="7.441">that means when this system Falls it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="553.4" dur="6.12">going to completely crash now if you</text>
  <text start="556.28" dur="4.98">compare this to the GDP numbers and we</text>
  <text start="559.52" dur="3.45">go back to the housing bubble actually</text>
  <text start="561.26" dur="4.829">let&amp;#39;s go back to the dot-com bubble and</text>
  <text start="562.97" dur="5.67">we look at the growth index GDP at the</text>
  <text start="566.089" dur="5.071">time of the dot-com bubble GDP was</text>
  <text start="568.64" dur="5.55">around a hundred and seventy on the</text>
  <text start="571.16" dur="5.67">growth index the dot-com bubble was</text>
  <text start="574.19" dur="6.48">around a hundred ninety and then</text>
  <text start="576.83" dur="7.32">afterwards we see that the asset prices</text>
  <text start="580.67" dur="5.79">fell very close to where GDP was if we</text>
  <text start="584.15" dur="4.53">look at the housing bubble which is the</text>
  <text start="586.46" dur="4.14">at prices and look at the GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="588.68" dur="5.1">the GDP numbers at this point in time</text>
  <text start="590.6" dur="5.22">were around 225 on the growth index</text>
  <text start="593.78" dur="7.62">chart if we look at the housing bubble</text>
  <text start="595.82" dur="9.12">at the asset prices they were at 290</text>
  <text start="601.4" dur="6.42">points so we can see there was the</text>
  <text start="604.94" dur="4.98">spread is between 290 which is the asset</text>
  <text start="607.82" dur="9.33">prices it was above the GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="609.92" dur="9.81">which were 225 today we are at 365 which</text>
  <text start="617.15" dur="7.53">is the asset prices compared to GDP</text>
  <text start="619.73" dur="6.9">which is around 275 it&amp;#39;s a much larger</text>
  <text start="624.68" dur="5.34">spread and when we look at the housing</text>
  <text start="626.63" dur="5.61">bubble the asset prices fell if we look</text>
  <text start="630.02" dur="4.97">at the growth chart all the way down to</text>
  <text start="632.24" dur="6.24">where the GDP numbers were so if this</text>
  <text start="634.99" dur="5.5">asset prices bubble the central bankers</text>
  <text start="638.48" dur="4.47">bubble Falls to where the GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="640.49" dur="8.07">are right now we would fall all the way</text>
  <text start="642.95" dur="11.34">down to around 275 from 365 around that</text>
  <text start="648.56" dur="7.89">area I mean this is a huge implosion of</text>
  <text start="654.29" dur="3.45">the system and that means the stock</text>
  <text start="656.45" dur="2.88">marks going to come down that means the</text>
  <text start="657.74" dur="3.87">housing markets gonna come down that</text>
  <text start="659.33" dur="4.71">means all the bubbles are going to come</text>
  <text start="661.61" dur="5.4">down all at once again this was</text>
  <text start="664.04" dur="3.51">scheduled they knew what was going to</text>
  <text start="667.01" dur="1.98">happen</text>
  <text start="667.55" dur="4.29">they knew they only had a certain period</text>
  <text start="668.99" dur="5.07">of time they knew that the system</text>

  <text start="832.52" dur="3.84">start to realize that our country is</text>
  <text start="834.529" dur="4.351">corrupt and these leaders have done</text>

  <text start="860.81" dur="6.52">Russia China remember they were set up</text>
  <text start="864.36" dur="5.7">in the beginning stages of all of this</text>
  <text start="867.33" dur="5.22">to be the new reserve currency</text>
  <text start="870.06" dur="3.69">especially China the central bank</text>
  <text start="872.55" dur="3.87">Avenger was going to set up shop there</text>

  <text start="876.42" dur="2.78">gonna see the SDR</text>
  <text start="877.38" dur="5.43">we&amp;#39;re not seeing any of that right now</text>
  <text start="879.2" dur="7.42">we can see we&amp;#39;re being pushed away from</text>
  <text start="882.81" dur="5.67">that by Trump Xi Jinping and Putin we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="886.62" dur="3.81">not gonna be entering that central bank</text>
  <text start="888.48" dur="4.08">face I believe they&amp;#39;re working together</text>
  <text start="890.43" dur="5.55">to get rid of the central bank</text>
  <text start="892.56" dur="5.31">eventually one step at a time you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="895.98" dur="3.57">do everything at once remember they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="897.87" dur="4.14">been embedded in the system for many</text>
  <text start="899.55" dur="6.42">many many years and they set up shop in</text>
  <text start="902.01" dur="6.5">almost the entire world yes Russia has</text>
  <text start="905.97" dur="5.67">taken control over its central bank</text>
  <text start="908.51" dur="5.14">countries have taken control over their</text>
  <text start="911.64" dur="4.53">private Western central bank the United</text>
  <text start="913.65" dur="4.34">States needs to control over the private</text>
  <text start="916.17" dur="4.44">western central bank and nationalize it</text>
  <text start="917.99" dur="4.75">and control it and make it a people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="920.61" dur="5.73">economy but countries understand and</text>
  <text start="922.74" dur="7.11">they realize that the dollar eventually</text>
  <text start="926.34" dur="5.46">will no longer exist and countries now</text>
  <text start="929.85" dur="4.02">are looking to trade in their national</text>
  <text start="931.8" dur="4.65">currencies Russia has been screaming</text>
  <text start="933.87" dur="4.56">that countries should start to do this</text>
  <text start="936.45" dur="4.83">and many countries are doing this</text>
  <text start="938.43" dur="5.45">because they realize that this system is</text>
  <text start="941.28" dur="4.74">going to implode very very soon and</text>
  <text start="943.88" dur="4.96">everyone is getting prepared for this</text>
  <text start="946.02" dur="5.04">this is why Russia China India and the</text>
  <text start="948.84" dur="4.83">rest have been either repatriating their</text>
  <text start="951.06" dur="3.81">gold or purchasing as much gold as they</text>
  <text start="953.67" dur="3.51">possibly can because it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="954.87" dur="3.99">used as an insurance policy it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="957.18" dur="4.32">going to be used to build confidence</text>
  <text start="958.86" dur="5.31">listen we have the gold you can be</text>
  <text start="961.5" dur="4.62">confident in our new system China has</text>
  <text start="964.17" dur="3.42">the manufacturing China has all the</text>
  <text start="966.12" dur="5.1">exchanges that we have in the United</text>
  <text start="967.59" dur="5.46">States they have the belton road and the</text>
  <text start="971.22" dur="4.14">reason why they have all this is because</text>
  <text start="973.05" dur="2.58">over the many years they were being set</text>
  <text start="975.36" dur="3.81">up</text>
  <text start="975.63" dur="5.73">to be the next reserve currency the next</text>
  <text start="979.17" dur="4.05">area where everything was going to</text>
  <text start="981.36" dur="4.6">revolve around it they even have the</text>
  <text start="983.22" dur="4.87">petrol you wan right now so we</text>
  <text start="985.96" dur="4.65">can see how all of this is going to be</text>
  <text start="988.09" dur="5.16">playing out right now and this entire</text>
  <text start="990.61" dur="3.83">system was scheduled to come down and it</text>
  <text start="993.25" dur="5.52">was scheduled to come down</text>
  <text start="994.44" dur="5.35">most likely in 2019 around that time</text>
