  <text start="71.039" dur="6.301">all not set in stone I mean the Greek</text>

  <text start="127.08" dur="3.87">should just do without the bailout maybe</text>
  <text start="129.09" dur="7.979">they should get and remove themselves</text>
  <text start="130.95" dur="10.5">from the eurozone maybe they should go</text>
  <text start="137.069" dur="7.231">and create their own currency so</text>
  <text start="141.45" dur="5.91">basically what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="200.22" dur="8.34">companies and we see right now economic</text>
  <text start="203.61" dur="9.72">sentiment is basically imploding on</text>
  <text start="208.56" dur="9.42">itself right now this is not working out</text>
  <text start="213.33" dur="8.28">the Greek people they&amp;#39;re suffering under</text>
  <text start="217.98" dur="5.61">the central bank but again the central</text>

  <text start="227.22" dur="5.579">group the allegiances to themselves and</text>
  <text start="230.239" dur="6.28">if things don&amp;#39;t go the way they want</text>
  <text start="232.799" dur="5.401">they start war just like all these</text>
  <text start="236.519" dur="4.53">countries having this mass amount of</text>
  <text start="238.2" dur="5.7">debt things are not going the way they</text>
  <text start="241.049" dur="5.571">want so when things don&amp;#39;t go the way</text>
  <text start="243.9" dur="5.16">they want what do they do they start war</text>
  <text start="246.62" dur="4.51">because when their systems coming down</text>
  <text start="249.06" dur="4.2">they don&amp;#39;t want to be blamed so they</text>
  <text start="251.13" dur="5.849">have to blame something else and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="253.26" dur="7.17">use war to cover this up German</text>
  <text start="256.979" dur="6.331">unemployment their unemployment rate has</text>
  <text start="260.43" dur="6.18">ticked up now it is it&amp;#39;s at six point</text>
  <text start="263.31" dur="5.22">four percent in August it&amp;#39;s the agency</text>
  <text start="266.61" dur="4.29">reported that there&amp;#39;s about 23,000 more</text>
  <text start="268.53" dur="5.73">people that are jobless in august / july</text>
  <text start="270.9" dur="7.14">and that brings us to a 2.79 6 million</text>
  <text start="274.26" dur="6.63">people out of work right now the</text>
  <text start="278.04" dur="7.23">eurozone factory growth is lower than</text>
  <text start="280.89" dur="9.06">expected the index came in at 52.3 in</text>
  <text start="285.27" dur="6.66">August they were expecting 52.4 so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="289.95" dur="3.93">looking at this right now and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="291.93" dur="5.7">seeing that eurozone the eurozone is</text>
  <text start="293.88" dur="7.56">falling apart Greece is still falling</text>
  <text start="297.63" dur="10.8">apart and within the eurozone we see</text>
  <text start="301.44" dur="11.67">Spain Portugal France Italy spreading to</text>
  <text start="308.43" dur="8.22">the UK Germany all starting to crumble</text>
  <text start="313.11" dur="6.78">apart and this will spread and it will</text>
  <text start="316.65" dur="5.97">get worse and worse as time goes on now</text>
  <text start="319.89" dur="8.46">we understand the stock market just took</text>
  <text start="322.62" dur="11.61">a major dip again it created a creator</text>
  <text start="328.35" dur="7.89">of 470 points down and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="334.23" dur="3.81">see this quite a bit now where we have</text>
  <text start="336.24" dur="3.72">these incredible highs where all of a</text>
  <text start="338.04" dur="3.63">sudden the market is up by four or five</text>
  <text start="339.96" dur="4.44">hundred points and that all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="341.67" dur="5.99">the market drops four five six hundred</text>
  <text start="344.4" dur="5.1">points well we saw this back in 1929</text>
  <text start="347.66" dur="4.54">going through the summer months of</text>
  <text start="349.5" dur="7.02">August into September we saw it in 2008</text>
  <text start="352.2" dur="7.83">and at this point we see that this whole</text>
  <text start="356.52" dur="5.55">market is about to come down we</text>
  <text start="360.03" dur="5.13">understand the plunge protection team</text>
  <text start="362.07" dur="4.92">the high-frequency traders they cannot</text>
  <text start="365.16" dur="6.32">keep this thing propped up for long</text>
  <text start="366.99" dur="9.33">eventually the real market will overrun</text>
  <text start="371.48" dur="6.55">the inflated fake market because they</text>
  <text start="376.32" dur="5.01">will not be able to kick keep up with</text>
  <text start="378.03" dur="5.79">the selling in the market no matter how</text>
  <text start="381.33" dur="4.23">much the Fed creates and gives to the</text>
  <text start="383.82" dur="3.36">plunge protection team to purchase</text>
  <text start="385.56" dur="5.37">stocks they just can&amp;#39;t do it fast enough</text>
  <text start="387.18" dur="5.55">and we&amp;#39;ve seen a glimmer of this when</text>
  <text start="390.93" dur="5.04">the market dropped I think this was</text>
  <text start="392.73" dur="9.93">August twenty-fourth by a thousand plus</text>
  <text start="395.97" dur="9.48">points they were unprepared and they</text>
  <text start="402.66" dur="5.52">couldn&amp;#39;t keep up well when this market</text>
  <text start="405.45" dur="4.26">comes down it&amp;#39;s going to crash hard it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="408.18" dur="3.6">not going to do by four or five 600</text>
  <text start="409.71" dur="5.73">points it&amp;#39;s going to come down really</text>
  <text start="411.78" dur="6">hard they will lose all control we</text>
  <text start="415.44" dur="6.06">understand in Asia the markets were down</text>
  <text start="417.78" dur="7.8">in Europe the markets were down China</text>
  <text start="421.5" dur="6.21">right now is trying to stop what is</text>
  <text start="425.58" dur="5.37">happening now can they stop this most</text>
  <text start="427.71" dur="3.75">likely not and when we look at this I</text>
  <text start="430.95" dur="2.01">know</text>
  <text start="431.46" dur="3.69">the corporate media is out there though</text>
  <text start="432.96" dur="3.179">blaming everything on China just like we</text>
  <text start="435.15" dur="3.329">expected they were going to blame this</text>
  <text start="436.139" dur="4.62">on another country but we know this was</text>
  <text start="438.479" dur="4.981">coming for a long time we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="440.759" dur="5.521">following this all along and the cause</text>
  <text start="443.46" dur="5.06">of it is the central bank the cause of</text>
  <text start="446.28" dur="6.479">it goes back to two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="448.52" dur="7.049">nothing was fixed since that period all</text>
  <text start="452.759" dur="5.31">they did was prepare for themselves</text>
  <text start="455.569" dur="5.401">while keeping everyone in the dark</text>
  <text start="458.069" dur="6.69">pretending we were in a recovery and</text>
  <text start="460.97" dur="5.979">right now China starting october 15th</text>
  <text start="464.759" dur="4.711">banks will have to hold the equivalent</text>
  <text start="466.949" dur="5.34">of twenty percent of clients foreign</text>
  <text start="469.47" dur="5.039">exchange forward positions with the PBOC</text>
  <text start="472.289" dur="4.831">where the money will sit frozen for a</text>
  <text start="474.509" dur="4.291">year at zero percent interest obviously</text>
  <text start="477.12" dur="4.62">that will drive up the cost of taking</text>
  <text start="478.8" dur="5.07">speculative positions which the PBOC</text>
  <text start="481.74" dur="3.87">hopes will help narrow the gap between</text>
  <text start="483.87" dur="4.71">the onshore and offshore you one and</text>
  <text start="485.61" dur="5.19">bring down volatility it will also</text>
  <text start="488.58" dur="4.32">remove lots of speculative trades that</text>
  <text start="490.8" dur="4.38">aim at short-term gains as the reserves</text>
  <text start="492.9" dur="6.87">have minimum lock-up period for one year</text>
  <text start="495.18" dur="11.1">and this is coming from Stan Becky Lou</text>
  <text start="499.77" dur="8.76">so we can see at this point that China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.28" dur="3.87">taking precautions now I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="508.53" dur="4.819">this is going to work I think this whole</text>
  <text start="510.15" dur="6.36">thing is coming down I think right now</text>
  <text start="513.349" dur="5.471">China is trying to delay as much as they</text>
  <text start="516.51" dur="6.24">possibly can to unwind out of the</text>
  <text start="518.82" dur="5.73">Treasuries to position themselves to</text>
  <text start="522.75" dur="5.48">come out of this ahead remember they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="524.55" dur="6.539">been purchasing a huge amount of gold</text>
  <text start="528.23" dur="6.63">the u.s. right now is a consumer-based</text>
  <text start="531.089" dur="6.571">economy and there&amp;#39;s nothing to support</text>
  <text start="534.86" dur="4.51">anything here in the United States the</text>
  <text start="537.66" dur="4.41">whole thing was propped up by the</text>
  <text start="539.37" dur="4.68">central bank this economy right now is</text>
  <text start="542.07" dur="4.05">not a people&amp;#39;s economy there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="544.05" dur="4.229">here where the people have driven this</text>
  <text start="546.12" dur="4.11">higher and higher it&amp;#39;s all the central</text>
  <text start="548.279" dur="3.75">bank that has created bubble after</text>
  <text start="550.23" dur="6.51">bubble after bubble after bubble and</text>
  <text start="552.029" dur="8.041">they&amp;#39;re all ready to pop I mean it took</text>
  <text start="556.74" dur="6.51">seven years to get to this point it will</text>
  <text start="560.07" dur="5.069">take one day to bring the whole system</text>
  <text start="563.25" dur="6.6">down this happens</text>
  <text start="565.139" dur="6.331">the same way every single time we see</text>

  <text start="621.059" dur="6.03">the whole thing comes collapsing down</text>
  <text start="623.669" dur="4.59">this is what is happening right now now</text>
  <text start="627.089" dur="2.91">what&amp;#39;s funny in the corporate media</text>

  <text start="649.29" dur="7.649">very peculiar about all of this is that</text>

  <text start="679.679" dur="8.58">now is this whole thing is falling apart</text>

  <text start="967.41" dur="6.67">the danger zone throughout history there</text>
  <text start="971.98" dur="4.71">have only been 11 times when the sp500</text>
  <text start="974.08" dur="5.67">has declined more than five percent</text>
  <text start="976.69" dur="5.94">during the month of August when that has</text>
  <text start="979.75" dur="5.67">happened the stock market has almost</text>
  <text start="982.63" dur="5.13">always fallen in September as well</text>
  <text start="985.42" dur="5.57">September&amp;#39;s the only month in which the</text>
  <text start="987.76" dur="6.45">sp500 fell more frequently than it rose</text>
  <text start="990.99" dur="5.47">what&amp;#39;s more in the 11 times at the sp500</text>
  <text start="994.21" dur="4.89">fell by more than five percent in august</text>
  <text start="996.46" dur="4.56">it declined eighty percent of the</text>

  <text start="1005.06" dur="6.79">we&amp;#39;re seeing this happen how far can</text>
  <text start="1008.19" dur="5.94">stocks eventually get well husman he is</text>
  <text start="1011.85" dur="4.65">projecting that we could ultimately see</text>
  <text start="1014.13" dur="6.51">the market decline by more more than</text>
  <text start="1016.5" dur="6.09">fifty percent isn&amp;#39;t isn&amp;#39;t this what we</text>

  <text start="1024.12" dur="5.339">thousand points and the market came down</text>
  <text start="1026.28" dur="7.74">to six thousand remember the higher we</text>
  <text start="1029.459" dur="6.091">go the bigger the fall one thing that</text>
  <text start="1034.02" dur="3.72">could accelerate stock market losses</text>
  <text start="1035.55" dur="4.11">this time around is the fact that people</text>
  <text start="1037.74" dur="6.06">have been borrowing lots and lots of</text>
  <text start="1039.66" dur="6.27">money to buy stocks that works when the</text>
  <text start="1043.8" dur="5.34">stock market keeps going up but what</text>
  <text start="1045.93" dur="7.31">happens when the market falls well these</text>
  <text start="1049.14" dur="7.23">are called margin calls and banks and</text>
  <text start="1053.24" dur="6.58">lenders say we&amp;#39;re going to be issuing</text>
  <text start="1056.37" dur="6.63">our margin calls to those clients after</text>
  <text start="1059.82" dur="5.13">the market has fallen and guess what</text>
  <text start="1063" dur="3.12">these people have to pay up a lot of</text>
  <text start="1064.95" dur="8.4">these people don&amp;#39;t have the money to pay</text>
  <text start="1066.12" dur="9.57">up and things get worse other banks sent</text>
  <text start="1073.35" dur="5.67">out margin calls including us trust</text>
  <text start="1075.69" dur="5.7">Morgan Stanley Wells Fargo with margin</text>

  <text start="1083.22" dur="3.39">leverage before they&amp;#39;re forced to and</text>
  <text start="1084.93" dur="4.02">the boom in securities based lending</text>
  <text start="1086.61" dur="4.26">appears to be over and the wealth units</text>

  <text start="1090.87" dur="5.52">are likely to see the profits dented</text>
  <text start="1093.59" dur="3.52">just think about all those corporations</text>
  <text start="1096.39" dur="2.94">that</text>
  <text start="1097.11" dur="4.71">bought back their stocks what happens to</text>
