  <text start="87.86" dur="4.92">into the economic collapse news now</text>
  <text start="90.14" dur="5.49">during the holiday season we realize</text>
  <text start="92.78" dur="5.58">that companies will take on additional</text>
  <text start="95.63" dur="7.23">employees to help with the Christmas</text>
  <text start="98.36" dur="6.99">season and we see at this point that the</text>
  <text start="102.86" dur="5.88">initial jobless claims they have reached</text>
  <text start="105.35" dur="8.04">the lowest in 43 years for the Christmas</text>
  <text start="108.74" dur="8.46">week this week they printed at 267,000</text>
  <text start="113.39" dur="7.8">and initial jobless claims and the last</text>
  <text start="117.2" dur="7.47">time they were at this point during a</text>
  <text start="121.19" dur="7.289">holiday week was 1972 but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="124.67" dur="6.62">interesting when we look at the graph</text>
  <text start="128.479" dur="6.991">and we look at initial jobless claims</text>
  <text start="131.29" dur="11.44">they have hit very low points right</text>
  <text start="135.47" dur="11.909">before a major type of recession and it</text>
  <text start="142.73" dur="9.69">shot up dramatically this time we have</text>
  <text start="147.379" dur="8.821">dropped too ridiculous lows and we can</text>
  <text start="152.42" dur="7.409">see at this point we are heading for</text>
  <text start="156.2" dur="5.22">this major major problem and we know</text>
  <text start="159.829" dur="4.171">that these numbers are completely</text>
  <text start="161.42" dur="6.78">manipulated we know that Joan challenge</text>
  <text start="164" dur="7.08">gray &amp;amp; christmas has reporting layoffs</text>
  <text start="168.2" dur="6.3">going back to June of 2014 approaching a</text>
  <text start="171.08" dur="6.48">million people and we are already</text>
  <text start="174.5" dur="5.25">hearing more companies that are going to</text>
  <text start="177.56" dur="5.7">be laying off and yesterday we talked</text>
  <text start="179.75" dur="6.98">about retail sales they are a disaster</text>
  <text start="183.26" dur="6.3">and we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot of people</text>
  <text start="186.73" dur="5.65">lose their jobs stores are going to</text>
  <text start="189.56" dur="4.05">close more and more corporations are</text>
  <text start="192.38" dur="2.94">going to lay off people because they</text>
  <text start="193.61" dur="4.29">don&amp;#39;t have the sales the revenue is not</text>
  <text start="195.32" dur="5.19">coming in and they need to cut expenses</text>
  <text start="197.9" dur="5.46">and we&amp;#39;ve been seeing this with many</text>
  <text start="200.51" dur="6.93">many corporations and this is going to</text>
  <text start="203.36" dur="11.76">continue now we realize that the dollar</text>
  <text start="207.44" dur="11.9">as a reserve currency is completely and</text>
  <text start="215.12" dur="9.15">utterly falling apart around the world</text>
  <text start="219.34" dur="8.649">many of the countries are dropping the</text>
  <text start="224.27" dur="6.27">dollar or limiting the dollar in their</text>
  <text start="227.989" dur="4.56">reserve basket and they are taking on</text>
  <text start="230.54" dur="4.77">other currencies we know that China and</text>
  <text start="232.549" dur="5.94">Russia are calling on the BRIC nations</text>
  <text start="235.31" dur="6.78">to use their own currencies not the</text>
  <text start="238.489" dur="7.621">dollar and we see Zimbabwe now has</text>
  <text start="242.09" dur="6.899">become China&amp;#39;s first African colony</text>
  <text start="246.11" dur="10.409">that&amp;#39;s going to adopt the Chinese you</text>
  <text start="248.989" dur="10.831">one as its currency I mean what we are</text>
  <text start="256.519" dur="5.131">seeing here is exactly what we thought</text>
  <text start="259.82" dur="5.01">was going to happen and it has already</text>
  <text start="261.65" dur="5.34">started they&amp;#39;re not going to use the</text>
  <text start="264.83" dur="4.8">dollar they&amp;#39;re going to use the Chinese</text>
  <text start="266.99" dur="8.03">you want and we know that this is going</text>
  <text start="269.63" dur="5.39">to spread among the African colonies and</text>
  <text start="275.29" dur="7.42">right now we see that other African</text>
  <text start="279.56" dur="8.82">countries are looking at the Chinese you</text>
  <text start="282.71" dur="9.12">want Kenya is a clearinghouse for the</text>
  <text start="288.38" dur="6.23">you one and you know they&amp;#39;re next on the</text>
  <text start="291.83" dur="5.579">list so this is going to spread</text>
  <text start="294.61" dur="4.359">throughout Africa and this</text>
  <text start="297.409" dur="4.65">why the United States has been trying to</text>
  <text start="298.969" dur="7.44">get into Africa and basically garrison</text>
  <text start="302.059" dur="10.801">troops in all of these countries now out</text>
  <text start="306.409" dur="9.93">in Ukraine we see that the Donetsk and</text>
  <text start="312.86" dur="6.539">Lugansk area they don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="316.339" dur="4.8">necessary to extend the Minsk agreements</text>
  <text start="319.399" dur="4.32">and the reason why they&amp;#39;re saying this</text>
  <text start="321.139" dur="6.03">it&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;re saying they Kiev</text>
  <text start="323.719" dur="6.03">hasn&amp;#39;t even upheld to the agreement to</text>
  <text start="327.169" dur="6.18">this point what would be the purpose of</text>
  <text start="329.749" dur="6.69">going past the December deadline because</text>
  <text start="333.349" dur="7.23">they haven&amp;#39;t had elections none of it</text>
  <text start="336.439" dur="5.73">was fully implemented and what would be</text>
  <text start="340.579" dur="4.32">the purpose of extending this because we</text>
  <text start="342.169" dur="4.97">know at this point that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="344.899" dur="6.26">going to do anything at this point and</text>
  <text start="347.139" dur="7.661">we see already that Ukraine Kiev</text>
  <text start="351.159" dur="6.67">poroshenko is out there saying yeah you</text>
  <text start="354.8" dur="6.359">know what we&amp;#39;re really not implementing</text>
  <text start="357.829" dur="6.81">the mints to ceasefire agreement Kiev</text>
  <text start="361.159" dur="6.42">believes that the only appropriate</text>
  <text start="364.639" dur="5.851">result is Ford on bass they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="367.579" dur="5.911">ansible gas area the only appropriate</text>
  <text start="370.49" dur="6.959">result is for them to a surrender and to</text>
  <text start="373.49" dur="6.599">be integrated back into Ukraine this is</text>
  <text start="377.449" dur="5.43">why they&amp;#39;ve been stalling and we can see</text>
  <text start="380.089" dur="7.41">already that this is where they are</text>
  <text start="382.879" dur="7.921">headed and as we approach 2016 moving</text>
  <text start="387.499" dur="7.14">into the first part we might see some</text>
  <text start="390.8" dur="8.039">type of false flag in the Ukrainian area</text>
  <text start="394.639" dur="6.96">could be in Crimea it could be in the</text>
  <text start="398.839" dur="5.73">Dom bass area it could happen in Kiev</text>
  <text start="401.599" dur="6.06">but wherever it happens it will be</text>
  <text start="404.569" dur="8.7">blamed on Russia and the southeastern</text>
  <text start="407.659" dur="8.58">people now we talked about the coalition</text>
  <text start="413.269" dur="5.64">forces going into Libya and starting</text>
  <text start="416.239" dur="5.01">bombing runs and we&amp;#39;re getting more and</text>
  <text start="418.909" dur="5.84">more confirmation and everything that we</text>
  <text start="421.249" dur="6.03">looked at is leading us to believe that</text>
  <text start="424.749" dur="3.431">this is definitely going to happen</text>
  <text start="427.279" dur="3.36">because we&amp;#39;re looking at all the</text>
  <text start="428.18" dur="3.15">indicators are we fortune tellers do we</text>
  <text start="430.639" dur="3.96">have a crystal</text>
  <text start="431.33" dur="6.299">no but we look at indicators we put the</text>
  <text start="434.599" dur="7.53">pieces together and we can see what they</text>
  <text start="437.629" dur="7.141">are planning and right now we see the</text>
  <text start="442.129" dur="6">ambassador to the United Nations is</text>
  <text start="444.77" dur="6.48">saying that yes Italy France the UK and</text>
  <text start="448.129" dur="6">us are definitely preparing air strikes</text>
  <text start="451.25" dur="4.349">in Libya now of course they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="454.129" dur="4.951">everyone they&amp;#39;re going after the Islamic</text>
  <text start="455.599" dur="6.481">state but we know this is not what they</text>
  <text start="459.08" dur="5.339">are doing they&amp;#39;re going after the</text>
  <text start="462.08" dur="5.28">elected government they&amp;#39;re getting rid</text>
  <text start="464.419" dur="6.331">of those people who oppose the puppet</text>
  <text start="467.36" dur="8.01">government to recapture the entire</text>
  <text start="470.75" dur="7.319">country once again now we hear stories</text>
  <text start="475.37" dur="5.37">about Turkey how they&amp;#39;re withdrawing</text>
  <text start="478.069" dur="4.231">their troops well we come to find out</text>
  <text start="480.74" dur="4.2">they are not withdrawing the troops</text>
  <text start="482.3" dur="4.25">whatsoever despite them telling us yes</text>
  <text start="484.94" dur="4.11">where you&amp;#39;ve done a partial withdrawal</text>
  <text start="486.55" dur="7.69">we&amp;#39;re seeing that Turkish forces and</text>
  <text start="489.05" dur="8.25">their training camps in muscle are still</text>
  <text start="494.24" dur="5.76">there they haven&amp;#39;t done anything there</text>
  <text start="497.3" dur="4.709">has been no troop withdrawal whatsoever</text>
  <text start="500" dur="4.65">and this is coming from the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="502.009" dur="5.071">Defense Ministry they see nothing but</text>
  <text start="504.65" dur="6.74">Egypt is out there and they are saying</text>
  <text start="507.08" dur="6.569">yes turkey should withdraw their troops</text>
  <text start="511.39" dur="6.009">this is coming from the foreign minister</text>
  <text start="513.649" dur="5.25">of Egypt but turkeys not listening</text>
  <text start="517.399" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they want</text>
  <text start="518.899" dur="7.651">basically they have now invaded a</text>
  <text start="521.419" dur="9.301">sovereign country which could end up</text>
  <text start="526.55" dur="8.3">going to war because Iraq continually</text>
  <text start="530.72" dur="8.369">says to them we don&amp;#39;t want you here but</text>
  <text start="534.85" dur="6.28">they don&amp;#39;t listen now we know that</text>
  <text start="539.089" dur="3.331">Amnesty International came out and</text>
  <text start="541.13" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re saying all the russian strikes</text>
  <text start="542.42" dur="5.13">are killing innocent civilians the UN</text>
  <text start="545.99" dur="4.8">right now cannot independently confirm</text>
  <text start="547.55" dur="5.76">this whatsoever they looked at the</text>
  <text start="550.79" dur="5.7">evidence which there was none and</text>
  <text start="553.31" dur="6.779">they&amp;#39;re saying that no there is</text>
  <text start="556.49" dur="7.11">absolutely no verifiable verifiable</text>
  <text start="560.089" dur="5.171">proof that Russia has been bombing</text>
  <text start="563.6" dur="5.71">civilians whatsoever</text>
  <text start="565.26" dur="6.12">and Amnesty International has shown no</text>
  <text start="569.31" dur="4.98">proof but we have to remember Amnesty</text>
  <text start="571.38" dur="7.05">International is a US State Department</text>
  <text start="574.29" dur="12.39">propaganda mouthpiece it is funded and</text>
  <text start="578.43" dur="10.59">run by individuals like Soros and many</text>
  <text start="586.68" dur="7.37">other finance ears who are pushing</text>
  <text start="589.02" dur="8.01">certain agendas and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="594.05" dur="7.48">amnesty does the bidding for the US</text>
  <text start="597.03" dur="7.07">State Department so what we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="601.53" dur="7.41">at right now is they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="604.1" dur="7.72">propaganda to basically bad bad mouth</text>
  <text start="608.94" dur="4.56">Russia that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;re doing just</text>
  <text start="611.82" dur="4.8">like the propaganda that&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="613.5" dur="7.29">coming out about Assad gassing his own</text>
  <text start="616.62" dur="7.53">people it&amp;#39;s all propaganda one Russia</text>
  <text start="620.79" dur="7.89">and Syria asked for the proof they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="624.15" dur="7.92">provide any we have learned that the</text>
  <text start="628.68" dur="8.69">Obama administration pursued secret</text>
  <text start="632.07" dur="8.46">communications within the Syrian regime</text>
  <text start="637.37" dur="4.93">going Pat going back to 2011 and a</text>
  <text start="640.53" dur="6.65">little bit further because they were</text>
  <text start="642.3" dur="8.61">trying to get individuals in his</text>
  <text start="647.18" dur="7.84">government cabinet to start some type of</text>
  <text start="650.91" dur="10.89">coup they have dentists I&amp;#39;d certain</text>
  <text start="655.02" dur="9.69">Assad Alawite government people and they</text>
  <text start="661.8" dur="5.25">were trying to provoke them into</text>
  <text start="664.71" dur="5.37">overthrown Assad well that whole plan</text>
  <text start="667.05" dur="5.82">didn&amp;#39;t work as we know and what has</text>
  <text start="670.08" dur="5.37">happened since then they went to plan B</text>
  <text start="672.87" dur="6.15">and that was basically arming the rebels</text>
  <text start="675.45" dur="7.92">and starting a civil war to try to</text>
  <text start="679.02" dur="7.62">overthrow Assad we&amp;#39;ve seen this Civil</text>
  <text start="683.37" dur="6.06">War go on since 2011 up to the present</text>
  <text start="686.64" dur="4.11">day we&amp;#39;ve seen it morph into many</text>
  <text start="689.43" dur="4.01">different things we&amp;#39;ve seen it morph</text>
  <text start="690.75" dur="7.62">into the Islamic state and terrorism and</text>
  <text start="693.44" dur="7.48">at this point Russia has been</text>
  <text start="698.37" dur="5.43">destroying the proxy army for the United</text>
  <text start="700.92" dur="7.5">States and it is completely remarkable</text>
  <text start="703.8" dur="8.01">that the Western leaders only brought up</text>
  <text start="708.42" dur="6.09">peace or cease fire when they were</text>
  <text start="711.81" dur="5.27">losing ground when the Islamic state and</text>
  <text start="714.51" dur="6.59">the Free Syrian Army al-nusrah al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="717.08" dur="8.199">were completely losing territory in</text>
  <text start="721.1" dur="9.58">Syria now think about it they asked for</text>
  <text start="725.279" dur="9.331">a cease fire this is like a timeout so</text>
  <text start="730.68" dur="10.02">they can regroup yes they added in that</text>
  <text start="734.61" dur="9.84">they will let Assad stay in power they</text>
  <text start="740.7" dur="7.47">will let the people of Syria vote for</text>
  <text start="744.45" dur="7.11">Assad or any other candidate and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="748.17" dur="5.34">let it be democratic and free and open</text>
  <text start="751.56" dur="4.11">and monitored by international monitors</text>
  <text start="753.51" dur="4.56">but we know it&amp;#39;s never going to get that</text>
  <text start="755.67" dur="5.49">far what they really wanted at this</text>
  <text start="758.07" dur="6.57">point was a timeout a ceasefire to</text>
  <text start="761.16" dur="9.03">regroup to move into plan what are they</text>
  <text start="764.64" dur="11.42">on Plan F now because we see at this</text>
  <text start="770.19" dur="9.03">point that everything in the UN summary</text>
  <text start="776.06" dur="5.17">calls for cease fire cease fire cease</text>
  <text start="779.22" dur="5.4">fire cease fire if we look at the</text>
  <text start="781.23" dur="6.57">resolution it asks mr. ban through his</text>
  <text start="784.62" dur="6.81">office of his special envoy to determine</text>
  <text start="787.8" dur="6.12">a ceasefire and a plan to support its</text>
  <text start="791.43" dur="4.52">implementation while urging member</text>
  <text start="793.92" dur="4.77">states in particular members of the ISSG</text>
  <text start="795.95" dur="5.02">to accelerate all efforts to achieve a</text>
  <text start="798.69" dur="4.1">ceasefire including through pressing all</text>
  <text start="800.97" dur="4.19">relevant parties to adhere to one</text>
  <text start="802.79" dur="5.049">emphasizing the need for a ceasefire</text>
  <text start="805.16" dur="6.13">monitoring and verification mechanism</text>
  <text start="807.839" dur="5.791">and basically when you read through all</text>
  <text start="811.29" dur="5.07">this it must say ceasefire about 19</text>
  <text start="813.63" dur="4.41">different times they&amp;#39;re trying to get</text>
