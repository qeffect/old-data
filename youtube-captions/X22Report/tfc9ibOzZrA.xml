  <text start="37.51" dur="7.34">collapse because it is coming and coming</text>
  <text start="41.53" dur="6.24">faster than everyone thinks it is and</text>
  <text start="44.85" dur="4.45">before I get started I just want to</text>
  <text start="47.77" dur="2.91">thank everyone for listening and I know</text>
  <text start="49.3" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s a little rough this week I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="50.68" dur="5.699">doing my pores a little bit later but</text>
  <text start="52.66" dur="5.1">I&amp;#39;m on the road and today I was able to</text>
  <text start="56.379" dur="5.881">do this a little bit earlier than I</text>
  <text start="57.76" dur="8.28">thought so that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s coming out</text>
  <text start="62.26" dur="5.85">earlier at this point now the markets if</text>
  <text start="66.04" dur="4.89">we look around since yesterday when Ben</text>
  <text start="68.11" dur="4.92">Bernanke talked about tapering and how</text>
  <text start="70.93" dur="4.259">he was going to cut back on by the way</text>
  <text start="73.03" dur="5.49">which they&amp;#39;re not going to do the</text>
  <text start="75.189" dur="5.461">markets started to drop in Asia Europe</text>
  <text start="78.52" dur="5.76">and here in America right now the</text>
  <text start="80.65" dur="6.359">markets are down around 200 points 262</text>
  <text start="84.28" dur="6.659">points at this time gold has been snack</text>
  <text start="87.009" dur="6.15">smacked down below 1300 and why are they</text>
  <text start="90.939" dur="4.771">doing this well you have to remember</text>
  <text start="93.159" dur="4.71">that the only one the only thing that</text>
  <text start="95.71" dur="4.979">was propping up the stock market was the</text>
  <text start="97.869" dur="4.89">Federal Reserve by giving the money to</text>
  <text start="100.689" dur="4.32">the banks by buying their toxic assets</text>
  <text start="102.759" dur="6.031">instructing them to take that money and</text>
  <text start="105.009" dur="5.61">buy stocks so the stock market Rises and</text>
  <text start="108.79" dur="4.619">they were doing this at 40 to 45 billion</text>
  <text start="110.619" dur="6.661">dollars a month and guess what the Fed</text>
  <text start="113.409" dur="6.841">owns land and the banks are pumping up</text>
  <text start="117.28" dur="5.82">the market and basically when normal</text>
  <text start="120.25" dur="4.86">everyday investors hear that the the Fed</text>
  <text start="123.1" dur="4.35">is not going to pump up the market</text>
  <text start="125.11" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re thinking holy crap that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="127.45" dur="3.059">only thing that&amp;#39;s keeping it up so we</text>
  <text start="129.13" dur="3.78">need to pull our money out of this</text>
  <text start="130.509" dur="4.231">before it collapses and I said in my</text>
  <text start="132.91" dur="3.02">previous episodes that billionaire is</text>
  <text start="134.74" dur="2.719">already</text>
  <text start="135.93" dur="3.179">I&amp;#39;ve been pulling their money out</text>
  <text start="137.459" dur="4.98">because there I thought we&amp;#39;re at the</text>
  <text start="139.109" dur="5.011">height now and they realize that the</text>
  <text start="142.439" dur="3.481">market will is going to start crumbling</text>
  <text start="144.12" dur="3.75">down and everyone has to remember the</text>
  <text start="145.92" dur="6.629">stock market is not the gauge of the</text>
  <text start="147.87" dur="7.199">economy this is completely separate and</text>
  <text start="152.549" dur="4.47">there&amp;#39;s a disconnect between the economy</text>
  <text start="155.069" dur="4.62">and the stock market this happened</text>
  <text start="157.019" dur="4.83">during the Great Depression right before</text>
  <text start="159.689" dur="4.53">the stock market collapse the stock</text>
  <text start="161.849" dur="4.711">market was at its all-time highs and</text>
  <text start="164.219" dur="4.681">started to fluctuate at its all-time</text>
  <text start="166.56" dur="5.399">highs just like we&amp;#39;re seeing now but the</text>
  <text start="168.9" dur="6.179">economy was having many many problems</text>
  <text start="171.959" dur="5.46">people were losing work people credit</text>
  <text start="175.079" dur="4.621">was drying up but no one realized this</text>
  <text start="177.419" dur="4.831">because at all eyes again we&amp;#39;re on the</text>
  <text start="179.7" dur="4.95">stock market same thing happened in 2008</text>
  <text start="182.25" dur="4.53">go back and check it out the stock</text>
  <text start="184.65" dur="5.28">market was at its all times high around</text>
  <text start="186.78" dur="8.519">14,000 or so it started to fluctuate at</text>
  <text start="189.93" dur="7.889">the top and but the economy it was doing</text>
  <text start="195.299" dur="5.821">very very poorly prior to October of</text>
  <text start="197.819" dur="7.35">2008 and people couldn&amp;#39;t sell their</text>
  <text start="201.12" dur="6.42">homes subprime was an issue and credit</text>
  <text start="205.169" dur="5.521">was drying up people&amp;#39;s homes that used</text>
  <text start="207.54" dur="5.159">to you know were sold in a in a week or</text>
  <text start="210.69" dur="5.219">so now we&amp;#39;re going six seven months</text>
  <text start="212.699" dur="6.831">before they were sold and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="215.909" dur="6.181">this today we&amp;#39;re seeing that the economy</text>
  <text start="219.53" dur="4.48">the amount of people who are on food</text>
  <text start="222.09" dur="4.2">stamps the amount of people who are</text>
  <text start="224.01" dur="5.839">looking for employment the amount of</text>
  <text start="226.29" dur="8.58">people who are just trying to get by and</text>
  <text start="229.849" dur="6.76">can&amp;#39;t do it and all eyes again have been</text>
  <text start="234.87" dur="3.75">moved to the stock market because this</text>
  <text start="236.609" dur="4.321">is how they hypnotize the people to</text>
  <text start="238.62" dur="4.799">think that there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong and I</text>
  <text start="240.93" dur="4.889">done this in a previous episode where I</text>
  <text start="243.419" dur="5.52">said it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like lord of the rings</text>
  <text start="245.819" dur="5.1">and all eyes are kept on the stock</text>
  <text start="248.939" dur="5.101">market why other things are happening</text>
  <text start="250.919" dur="6">around the people and no one really</text>
  <text start="254.04" dur="4.919">realizes it no one understands what is</text>
  <text start="256.919" dur="4.891">going on but today the markets are down</text>
  <text start="258.959" dur="6.061">and it&amp;#39;s all around the world because of</text>
  <text start="261.81" dur="6.87">what Ben Bernanke said so what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="265.02" dur="4.2">thinking is there smacking down gold and</text>
  <text start="268.68" dur="2.34">why</text>
  <text start="269.22" dur="6.42">they doing this because they do not want</text>
  <text start="271.02" dur="7.62">anybody anybody to put to take their</text>
  <text start="275.64" dur="7.62">money out of equities and put them into</text>
  <text start="278.64" dur="6.81">gold or anywhere else because you have</text>
  <text start="283.26" dur="4.8">to remember a couple weeks back Ben</text>
  <text start="285.45" dur="5.73">Bernanke dared people to get into the</text>
  <text start="288.06" dur="5.93">equity market he dared them imagine if</text>
  <text start="291.18" dur="6">you listen to him right now but anyhow</text>
  <text start="293.99" dur="5.59">he dared people to get into the market</text>
  <text start="297.18" dur="5.73">and now since the market has been going</text>
  <text start="299.58" dur="7.41">down it&amp;#39;s a total of what almost 466</text>
  <text start="302.91" dur="6.24">points in the last two days he can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="306.99" dur="3.96">show that gold is a safe haven for</text>
  <text start="309.15" dur="4.35">people to put their money and precious</text>
  <text start="310.95" dur="5.07">metals I should say so there smacking</text>
  <text start="313.5" dur="4.92">that down making people think that oh no</text>
  <text start="316.02" dur="5.04">that&amp;#39;s a terrible place to go so either</text>
  <text start="318.42" dur="4.11">put your money in the dollar or put it</text>
  <text start="321.06" dur="3.12">in the equity market which they&amp;#39;d rather</text>
  <text start="322.53" dur="3.99">you do is put it in the equity market</text>
  <text start="324.18" dur="3.3">and what I&amp;#39;m thinking they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="326.52" dur="3.149">do they&amp;#39;re going to use the plunge</text>
  <text start="327.48" dur="4.32">protection team the high-frequency</text>
  <text start="329.669" dur="4.381">traders they&amp;#39;re going to pump more money</text>
  <text start="331.8" dur="4.86">into the system to try to pump this back</text>
  <text start="334.05" dur="6.09">up now is it going to happen today</text>
  <text start="336.66" dur="6.72">probably not but friday might end on a</text>
  <text start="340.14" dur="5.22">better note that it is today but they</text>
  <text start="343.38" dur="4.11">will do it i&amp;#39;m going to tell you right</text>
  <text start="345.36" dur="6.39">now by Monday or Tuesday you&amp;#39;ll see the</text>
  <text start="347.49" dur="5.91">market going back up that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="351.75" dur="4.11">thinking they&amp;#39;re going to do because</text>
  <text start="353.4" dur="6.48">again they have to keep this going they</text>
  <text start="355.86" dur="6.09">cannot stop they got to continually pump</text>
  <text start="359.88" dur="4.14">up the market and keep all eyes on the</text>
  <text start="361.95" dur="4.05">stock market why everything else falls</text>
  <text start="364.02" dur="4.32">around and crumbles around everyone</text>
  <text start="366" dur="4.5">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="368.34" dur="4.8">news today now rush it now this is very</text>
  <text start="370.5" dur="5.55">important Russia and China to seal an</text>
  <text start="373.14" dur="6.57">unprecedented oil contract which will</text>
  <text start="376.05" dur="7.67">bypass the US dollar completely and</text>
  <text start="379.71" dur="7.5">their deal is worth more than 60 billion</text>
  <text start="383.72" dur="6.58">dollars and the Oracle goes on to say a</text>
  <text start="387.21" dur="6.11">major contract it would not be an</text>
  <text start="390.3" dur="7.02">exaggeration to call it an unprecedented</text>
  <text start="393.32" dur="6.46">contract with the Rosneft company has</text>
  <text start="397.32" dur="5.19">been drafted prospective crew deliveries</text>
  <text start="399.78" dur="3.42">to China will top hundreds of millions</text>
  <text start="402.51" dur="4.17">of</text>
  <text start="403.2" dur="7.11">and exceed 60 billion in the dollar</text>
  <text start="406.68" dur="5.61">equivalent and this is going they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="410.31" dur="7.38">need the u.s. they don&amp;#39;t need the Middle</text>
  <text start="412.29" dur="9.03">East and this is a huge huge blow to the</text>
  <text start="417.69" dur="6.63">Western powers and the US reserve</text>
  <text start="421.32" dur="8.04">currency and there are making their own</text>
  <text start="424.32" dur="7.68">deals and basically bypassing everything</text>
  <text start="429.36" dur="4.32">and when a lot of countries are starting</text>
  <text start="432" dur="4.2">to bypass the dollar make deals in</text>
  <text start="433.68" dur="5.43">trading in other currencies and what</text>
  <text start="436.2" dur="6.03">happens is since they do not need the US</text>
  <text start="439.11" dur="6.27">dollar they kind of send them back to</text>
  <text start="442.23" dur="5.94">the US more dollars that hit the US and</text>
  <text start="445.38" dur="7.52">this was in a previous know maybe 10</text>
  <text start="448.17" dur="7.73">episodes back as more countries do not</text>
  <text start="452.9" dur="5.74">use the US dollar as their reserve</text>
  <text start="455.9" dur="5.26">currency that money is going to come</text>
  <text start="458.64" dur="6.66">back to the United States and some of it</text>
  <text start="461.16" dur="6.12">has and more of its going to that means</text>
  <text start="465.3" dur="4.92">there&amp;#39;s more currency in the market</text>
  <text start="467.28" dur="5.88">which means inflation that means there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="470.22" dur="5.97">more dollars in the system more dollars</text>
  <text start="473.16" dur="4.77">less value of the dollar means prices of</text>
  <text start="476.19" dur="5.37">things actually we shouldn&amp;#39;t say that</text>
  <text start="477.93" dur="5.97">prices of things do not go up the amount</text>
  <text start="481.56" dur="5.94">of dollars that it takes to buy</text>
  <text start="483.9" dur="5.25">something you need more of so when</text>
  <text start="487.5" dur="4.08">something was a dollar and you had a</text>
  <text start="489.15" dur="5.25">dollar that&amp;#39;s all it was but now your</text>
  <text start="491.58" dur="5.19">currency when it&amp;#39;s valued less you need</text>
  <text start="494.4" dur="4.05">more of it to buy the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="496.77" dur="3.87">and that&amp;#39;s really what we should be</text>
  <text start="498.45" dur="4.17">saying we shouldn&amp;#39;t really say things go</text>
  <text start="500.64" dur="5.43">up we should say our value of our</text>
  <text start="502.62" dur="4.98">currency is decreasing and that&amp;#39;s why it</text>
  <text start="506.07" dur="4.8">takes us that&amp;#39;s why it takes more</text>
  <text start="507.6" dur="6.23">dollars okay let&amp;#39;s move on here the bond</text>
  <text start="510.87" dur="5.88">implosion has officially begun and</text>
  <text start="513.83" dur="5.14">basically what they&amp;#39;re saying is the</text>
  <text start="516.75" dur="6.09">primary driver of stocks for the last</text>
  <text start="518.97" dur="5.85">four years has been the hope of more fed</text>
  <text start="522.84" dur="5.76">stimulus and now that the Fed is saying</text>
  <text start="524.82" dur="8.46">that they&amp;#39;re going to taper them we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="528.6" dur="7.679">going to see the bonds start to falter</text>
  <text start="533.28" dur="6.45">and this goes on to say that this hope</text>
  <text start="536.279" dur="5.97">has put a floor under all assets prices</text>
  <text start="539.73" dur="5">as market participants new the Fed was</text>
  <text start="542.249" dur="6.33">involved in the market as a result</text>
  <text start="544.73" dur="7.12">everything stocks bond commodities even</text>
  <text start="548.579" dur="8.01">currencies has been artificially propped</text>
  <text start="551.85" dur="7.02">up and basically you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="556.589" dur="4.021">looking this article does take a look at</text>
  <text start="558.87" dur="4.969">the spike in the tenure of Treasury</text>
  <text start="560.61" dur="5.219">yield and basically I think Max Keiser</text>
  <text start="563.839" dur="3.701">said in the spring that we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="565.829" dur="3.18">have a bond collapse and a lot of others</text>
  <text start="567.54" dur="5.909">have said we were going to have a bond</text>
  <text start="569.009" dur="7.351">collapse coming 2013 the spring time but</text>
  <text start="573.449" dur="6.211">you know no one can be exact and</text>
  <text start="576.36" dur="4.38">predicting something so it you know it</text>
  <text start="579.66" dur="3.96">could be the spring it could be the</text>
  <text start="580.74" dur="5.039">summer might be the fall but that is</text>
  <text start="583.62" dur="5.219">going to happen and there was another</text>
  <text start="585.779" dur="4.56">article that said more to come and we</text>
  <text start="588.839" dur="4.05">know the Fed has been propping</text>
  <text start="590.339" dur="4.711">everything up and this goes and to say</text>
  <text start="592.889" dur="3.841">the economic fundamentals were not</text>
  <text start="595.05" dur="4.139">supporting the lofty levels of the</text>
  <text start="596.73" dur="5.52">market which had rested upon one thing</text>
  <text start="599.189" dur="8.031">and one thing alone which was liquidity</text>
  <text start="602.25" dur="7.74">and and basically you know since the Fed</text>
  <text start="607.22" dur="4.39">kind of proved it yesterday by saying</text>
  <text start="609.99" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re going to taper in the markets</text>
  <text start="611.61" dur="4.56">take a plummet they go down because</text>
  <text start="613.68" dur="5.129">everyone was riding the wave of these</text>
  <text start="616.17" dur="3.87">said easy money and then printing and</text>
  <text start="618.809" dur="3.541">basically that&amp;#39;s all the Fed knows how</text>
  <text start="620.04" dur="5.399">to do is print but they knew what they</text>
  <text start="622.35" dur="6.029">were doing they knew that they were</text>
  <text start="625.439" dur="5.4">propping up the market they knew that</text>
  <text start="628.379" dur="4.71">this was going to be a major major</text>
  <text start="630.839" dur="4.891">collapse and this was the all done on</text>
  <text start="633.089" dur="4.68">purpose so when everyone and this is why</text>

  <text start="637.769" dur="5.79">market they wanted essential Baker&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="640.679" dur="6.811">talking about they wanted everyone in so</text>
  <text start="643.559" dur="5.431">when this thing collapses they steal the</text>
  <text start="647.49" dur="3.329">people&amp;#39;s wealth I mean how much wealth</text>
  <text start="648.99" dur="3.87">was lost in two thousand eight thirty</text>
  <text start="650.819" dur="4.02">eight percent of the people lost their</text>
  <text start="652.86" dur="5.43">wealth this this is going to be</text>
  <text start="654.839" dur="5.401">unprecedented when this thing comes</text>
  <text start="658.29" dur="3.989">tumbling down and also you have to</text>
  <text start="660.24" dur="3.93">remember the set is printing a button</text>
  <text start="662.279" dur="4.74">and creating money out of thin air and</text>
  <text start="664.17" dur="4.59">what are they buying with it they are</text>

  <text start="842.46" dur="4.95">told to lie about the foreclosure</text>
  <text start="844.62" dur="5.7">practices now we kind of all knew this</text>
  <text start="847.41" dur="4.86">but you know basically what banks were</text>
  <text start="850.32" dur="4.62">doing and I know I have a couple people</text>

  <text start="881.55" dur="5.52">still doing good so they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="884.82" dur="3.54">sell them and foreclose on the</text>
  <text start="887.07" dur="3.81">properties until the real estate market</text>
  <text start="888.36" dur="5.07">goes back up and they can get something</text>
  <text start="890.88" dur="5.64">for them plus since the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="893.43" dur="4.47">is buying up the toxic assets there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="896.52" dur="3.63">incentive for them to foreclose on</text>
  <text start="897.9" dur="5.04">anyone or because they because they</text>
  <text start="900.15" dur="4.53">figure well we know 45 billions coming</text>
  <text start="902.94" dur="3.81">in each month we&amp;#39;ll just wait for the</text>
  <text start="904.68" dur="5.36">Fed to come around and snatch these up</text>
  <text start="906.75" dur="3.29">and we&amp;#39;ll get the cash for it and</text>
  <text start="910.31" dur="4.66">basically this article goes on to say</text>
  <text start="912.84" dur="4.26">employees of Bank of America say they</text>
  <text start="914.97" dur="4.28">were encouraged to lie to customers and</text>
  <text start="917.1" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;re even rewarded for closing on homes</text>
  <text start="919.25" dur="5.02">staffers of the financial giant claim in</text>
  <text start="921.66" dur="7.53">new court documents and they had the</text>
  <text start="924.27" dur="8.36">robo-signing scandal and basically this</text>
  <text start="929.19" dur="5.37">was to get more homes on their books and</text>
  <text start="932.63" dur="3.28">they</text>
  <text start="934.56" dur="2.88">I don&amp;#39;t know if everyone has heard these</text>
  <text start="935.91" dur="3.63">stories but there were people who had</text>
  <text start="937.44" dur="4.38">their mortgages completely paid off and</text>
  <text start="939.54" dur="4.08">they own their houses outright but the</text>
  <text start="941.82" dur="4.26">banks were saying that they own them and</text>
  <text start="943.62" dur="4.26">they were foreclosing on them or and</text>
  <text start="946.08" dur="4.59">because they were putting these houses</text>
  <text start="947.88" dur="5.52">on their books to prop up their balance</text>
  <text start="950.67" dur="6.09">sheet and this whole thing because these</text>
  <text start="953.4" dur="5.879">all these banks were insolvent they they</text>
  <text start="956.76" dur="5.31">will not be able to last through the</text>
  <text start="959.279" dur="6.181">next collapse and that&amp;#39;s why if you look</text>
  <text start="962.07" dur="5.43">at all the terms of service and you look</text>
  <text start="965.46" dur="4.56">at the FDIC Bank of England document</text>
  <text start="967.5" dur="4.68">which was created in December of 2012 we</text>
  <text start="970.02" dur="5.25">are switching not we they are switching</text>
  <text start="972.18" dur="5.19">from bailouts to bail ins and just like</text>
  <text start="975.27" dur="5.39">in Cyprus they are going to freeze your</text>
  <text start="977.37" dur="7.26">money take their money that they need</text>
  <text start="980.66" dur="6.4">from your accounts and put capital</text>
  <text start="984.63" dur="4.35">controls into effect where you are only</text>
  <text start="987.06" dur="3.81">allowed to access a certain portion of</text>
  <text start="988.98" dur="4.68">your money so if you have a hundred or</text>
  <text start="990.87" dur="4.98">200 or 50,000 in the bank you will</text>
  <text start="993.66" dur="5.55">allowed to take out 300 a day the rest</text>
  <text start="995.85" dur="6.75">will be gone other will be turned into</text>
  <text start="999.21" dur="6.33">bank stock and the other portion will be</text>
  <text start="1002.6" dur="5.76">frozen now we can tell that the economy</text>
  <text start="1005.54" dur="5.96">is not doing well and the stock market</text>
  <text start="1008.36" dur="8.19">can say whatever it&amp;#39;s an illusion and</text>
  <text start="1011.5" dur="7.66">because cat caterpillar basically be</text>
  <text start="1016.55" dur="6.99">collapsing caterpillar in north american</text>
  <text start="1019.16" dur="8.37">sales pretty much has completely dried</text>
  <text start="1023.54" dur="5.97">up and caterpillar released its may 2013</text>
  <text start="1027.53" dur="4.169">dealer statistics breaking down the</text>
  <text start="1029.51" dur="4.59">three month rolling average for machine</text>
  <text start="1031.699" dur="4.791">retail sales curiously unlike in</text>
  <text start="1034.1" dur="5.43">previous month when Asia and Pacific</text>
  <text start="1036.49" dur="5.98">China was the worst performing region on</text>
  <text start="1039.53" dur="5.82">a year-over-year basis in May it was the</text>
  <text start="1042.47" dur="5.79">u.s. that showed the worst results just</text>
  <text start="1045.35" dur="6.27">how bad retail sales in the u.s. clocked</text>
  <text start="1048.26" dur="5.97">at a negative sixteen percent clip just</text>
  <text start="1051.62" dur="6.44">barely above the negative eighteen</text>
  <text start="1054.23" dur="6.81">percent drop in April and basically</text>
  <text start="1058.06" dur="5.86">that&amp;#39;s why we see retail stores back in</text>
  <text start="1061.04" dur="5.84">i think was january or februari when it</text>
  <text start="1063.92" dur="4.53">came out that best by radio shack</text>
  <text start="1066.88" dur="5.21">gamestop</text>
  <text start="1068.45" dur="6.55">Barnes &amp;amp; Noble we&amp;#39;re all closing stores</text>
  <text start="1072.09" dur="6.57">if the economy is good you&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="1078.66" dur="6.15">off these people you&amp;#39;re expanding but</text>
  <text start="1081.78" dur="6.63">again with so many Americans out of work</text>
  <text start="1084.81" dur="8.04">and can&amp;#39;t find jobs the last thing they</text>
  <text start="1088.41" dur="9.3">do is retail so that&amp;#39;s why you see all</text>
  <text start="1092.85" dur="8.64">of these stores closing and for the</text>
  <text start="1097.71" dur="5.4">government and the Fed to tell us that</text>
  <text start="1101.49" dur="3.6">everything is okay is just absolutely</text>
  <text start="1103.11" dur="4.44">ridiculous because what do they do to</text>
  <text start="1105.09" dur="5.13">make it and keep this illusion going</text>
  <text start="1107.55" dur="4.26">they change the calculation for GDP they</text>
  <text start="1110.22" dur="4.98">change the calculation for unemployment</text>
  <text start="1111.81" dur="5.7">and they change the calculation for</text>
  <text start="1115.2" dur="4.53">inflation now on the x 22 report com</text>

  <text start="1143.46" dur="4.44">manufacturers are shrinking their</text>
  <text start="1145.26" dur="5.13">products down to try to keep the price</text>

  <text start="1178.05" dur="8.01">the tube for the it&amp;#39;s more money but</text>
  <text start="1181.86" dur="6.18">it&amp;#39;s a smaller package now and that was</text>
  <text start="1186.06" dur="4.7">from a year ago because we still had the</text>

  <text start="1252.039" dur="4.351">out and said no the rebels have been</text>
  <text start="1253.75" dur="4.679">using it and the the United States</text>
  <text start="1256.39" dur="3.659">wanted them to revise a report so</text>
  <text start="1258.429" dur="3.271">basically the report came out and said</text>
  <text start="1260.049" dur="3.87">the rebels and the Syrian government</text>

  <text start="1295.99" dur="7.89">the US government need to put Syria back</text>
  <text start="1301.419" dur="4.26">on the reserve note which is the u.s.</text>
