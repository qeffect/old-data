  <text start="169.61" dur="4.83">what is going on around the country</text>
  <text start="171.53" dur="6.03">around the world you can see why people</text>
  <text start="174.44" dur="6.21">are very nervous about what is happening</text>
  <text start="177.56" dur="4.83">right now and people realize that they</text>
  <text start="180.65" dur="4.68">need to change and we&amp;#39;re seeing more and</text>
  <text start="182.39" dur="6.33">more companies coming out and saying</text>
  <text start="185.33" dur="5.48">listen revenue is falling sales are just</text>
  <text start="188.72" dur="5.25">not there and of course they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="190.81" dur="4.72">different excuses of why this is all</text>
  <text start="193.97" dur="3.96">happening but we all know why it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="195.53" dur="5.16">happening we understand that the economy</text>
  <text start="197.93" dur="8.639">is not doing well but we see arrogance</text>
  <text start="200.69" dur="11.22">Erickson their sales they have plunged</text>
  <text start="206.569" dur="9.45">and they are warning that things are</text>
  <text start="211.91" dur="7.77">getting really bad and they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="216.019" dur="6.481">saying that profits have plunged by</text>
  <text start="219.68" dur="5.55">seventeen percent they&amp;#39;re warning</text>
  <text start="222.5" dur="5.549">investors they&amp;#39;re saying that the third</text>
  <text start="225.23" dur="6.36">quarter sales and profitability down the</text>
  <text start="228.049" dur="6.02">toilet it&amp;#39;s the tier rating faster than</text>
  <text start="231.59" dur="5.07">expected and there is no turnaround</text>
  <text start="234.069" dur="7.271">insight whatsoever of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="236.66" dur="7.829">blaming Brazil Russia Middle East what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.34" dur="4.709">happening in Europe that&amp;#39;s who does that</text>
  <text start="244.489" dur="4.951">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re blaming it on but</text>
  <text start="246.049" dur="5.371">when you look at the situation all these</text>
  <text start="249.44" dur="6.96">companies have one thing in common is</text>
  <text start="251.42" dur="7.679">that sales are declining revenue is</text>
  <text start="256.4" dur="7.17">declining they&amp;#39;re laying off people and</text>
  <text start="259.099" dur="6.871">the outlook doesn&amp;#39;t look good and the</text>
  <text start="263.57" dur="5.7">reason for all of this it&amp;#39;s because the</text>
  <text start="265.97" dur="6">economy is contracting deteriorating</text>
  <text start="269.27" dur="5.48">collapsing and this is why all these</text>
  <text start="271.97" dur="6.06">companies retailers shipbuilders</text>
  <text start="274.75" dur="5.62">electronic makers this is why this is</text>
  <text start="278.03" dur="4.109">all happening right now we see daewoo</text>
  <text start="280.37" dur="4.44">shipbuilding they&amp;#39;re going to cut their</text>
  <text start="282.139" dur="10.261">workforce by twenty four percent because</text>
  <text start="284.81" dur="11.49">of losses I mean that&amp;#39;s 3,000 jobs so</text>
  <text start="292.4" dur="5.64">more and more people are being let go we</text>
  <text start="296.3" dur="3.39">see from Bank of America</text>
  <text start="298.04" dur="4.62">did this last time where we looked at</text>
  <text start="299.69" dur="6.3">the bank of america internal data on</text>
  <text start="302.66" dur="6.57">credit card spending and again credit</text>
  <text start="305.99" dur="5.73">card spending is spending money that you</text>
  <text start="309.23" dur="5.16">really don&amp;#39;t have but they use this to</text>
  <text start="311.72" dur="4.32">see how the economy is doing so when</text>
  <text start="314.39" dur="2.91">people get their credit cards freed up a</text>
  <text start="316.04" dur="5.52">little bit they go out and they spend a</text>
  <text start="317.3" dur="7.23">little bit but they&amp;#39;re spending money</text>
  <text start="321.56" dur="7.28">they really don&amp;#39;t have but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="324.53" dur="8.37">seeing is September does not look good</text>
  <text start="328.84" dur="7.84">spending is deteriorating and we can see</text>
  <text start="332.9" dur="5.37">right now that this next report coming</text>
  <text start="336.68" dur="4.29">up where they&amp;#39;re going to be looking at</text>
  <text start="338.27" dur="4.35">retail spending it is probably not going</text>
  <text start="340.97" dur="4.05">to improve that much now we are coming</text>
  <text start="342.62" dur="5.31">into the holiday season we understand</text>
  <text start="345.02" dur="5.19">halloween is coming up Thanksgivings</text>
  <text start="347.93" dur="5.25">coming up then we have the holiday</text>
  <text start="350.21" dur="6.69">season so we will see a little bit of an</text>
  <text start="353.18" dur="5.52">upward movement in spending but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="356.9" dur="4.26">going to be where it should be because</text>
  <text start="358.7" dur="6.57">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a</text>
  <text start="361.16" dur="6.93">contraction of spending a contraction of</text>
  <text start="365.27" dur="5.94">retail a contraction of the global</text>
  <text start="368.09" dur="4.98">economy and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="371.21" dur="3.87">it is getting worse and worse than every</text>
  <text start="373.07" dur="5.7">holiday season when we started looking</text>
  <text start="375.08" dur="6.93">back at 2012 go into 2013 2014 2015 we</text>
  <text start="378.77" dur="6.15">can see the trend every single year</text>
  <text start="382.01" dur="6.84">where the holiday season gets worse and</text>
  <text start="384.92" dur="8.28">worse and worse and we look at Black</text>
  <text start="388.85" dur="6.33">Friday Cyber Monday and sales just</text>
  <text start="393.2" dur="4.83">aren&amp;#39;t there and every year after the</text>
  <text start="395.18" dur="4.65">holiday seasons we see thousands upon</text>
  <text start="398.03" dur="4.77">thousands of stores continually closed</text>
  <text start="399.83" dur="5.7">go bankrupt lay off people and nothing</text>
  <text start="402.8" dur="5.16">is going to change actually it will</text>
  <text start="405.53" dur="4.2">change its going to get worse this</text>
  <text start="407.96" dur="3.45">holiday season is probably going to be</text>
  <text start="409.73" dur="5.94">one of the worst holiday seasons that</text>
  <text start="411.41" dur="6.69">we&amp;#39;ve seen since 2008 we see Deutsche</text>
  <text start="415.67" dur="5.31">Bank well they&amp;#39;re just trying to stay</text>

  <text start="426.05" dur="4.77">just to keep the bank alive and we can</text>
  <text start="429.169" dur="2.4">see right now all of this is band-aid</text>
  <text start="430.82" dur="3.599">fix</text>
  <text start="431.569" dur="5.55">fixes I mean they are in very big</text>
  <text start="434.419" dur="3.93">trouble remember most of the banks</text>
  <text start="437.119" dur="4.47">throughout Europe in the United States</text>
  <text start="438.349" dur="5.55">these banks are insolvent these stress</text>
  <text start="441.589" dur="4.32">tests that&amp;#39;s propaganda to make you</text>
  <text start="443.899" dur="3.39">believe that everything is fine because</text>
  <text start="445.909" dur="3.03">of the banking crisis that we went</text>
  <text start="447.289" dur="3.93">through back in two thousand eight so</text>
  <text start="448.939" dur="4.26">they came up with this ridiculous stress</text>
  <text start="451.219" dur="3.69">test to convince everyone don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="453.199" dur="3.77">about it we got it under control but we</text>
  <text start="454.909" dur="9.361">know they do not have this under control</text>
  <text start="456.969" dur="10.48">we see HSBC they&amp;#39;re setting up red</text>
  <text start="464.27" dur="5.519">alerts all over the place and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="467.449" dur="7.8">just thrown up the ultimate warning</text>
  <text start="469.789" dur="8.55">signal in a note to clients which was</text>
  <text start="475.249" dur="6.75">released Wednesday Marie gun the head of</text>

  <text start="481.999" dur="6.9">that we have a red alert right here it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="484.069" dur="6.45">an imminent sell-off and stocks given</text>
  <text start="488.899" dur="6.35">the price action over the past few weeks</text>
  <text start="490.519" dur="7.32">and he&amp;#39;s looking at the elliott wave and</text>
  <text start="495.249" dur="5.2">he&amp;#39;s saying which will the elliott wave</text>
  <text start="497.839" dur="5.6">tracks alternating patterns in the stock</text>
  <text start="500.449" dur="6.8">market and he&amp;#39;s saying the behavior and</text>
  <text start="503.439" dur="8.71">the possible next move is a sharp</text>
  <text start="507.249" dur="8.311">downward sell-off and the market looks</text>
  <text start="512.149" dur="6.661">like it&amp;#39;s going to come crashing down</text>
  <text start="515.56" dur="6.07">now when did they say this was going to</text>
  <text start="518.81" dur="5.37">be they did not but we can see right now</text>
  <text start="521.63" dur="4.759">the way everything is going I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="524.18" dur="5.459">be surprised if it&amp;#39;s sooner than later</text>
  <text start="526.389" dur="6.82">now I talked about the different phases</text>
  <text start="529.639" dur="5.971">of the collapse in prior reports and we</text>
  <text start="533.209" dur="4.8">know there&amp;#39;s a phase one coming up where</text>
  <text start="535.61" dur="5.849">the central bank is going to look for</text>
  <text start="538.009" dur="5.94">more legislation to take more control of</text>
  <text start="541.459" dur="5.781">the economy really the global economy</text>
  <text start="543.949" dur="5.851">because really the Fed really controls</text>
  <text start="547.24" dur="5.05">what the other central banks are doing</text>
  <text start="549.8" dur="3.99">and then we have the bank of</text>
  <text start="552.29" dur="4.38">international sediment which is the</text>
  <text start="553.79" dur="7.43">central bank of central banks but we see</text>
  <text start="556.67" dur="8.46">right now they&amp;#39;re putting out feelers to</text>
  <text start="561.22" dur="8.04">see the reaction of getting more</text>
  <text start="565.13" dur="7.4">or control and they&amp;#39;re also putting out</text>
  <text start="569.26" dur="7.21">signals or they&amp;#39;re dropping bread crumbs</text>
  <text start="572.53" dur="7.18">to let us know that maybe a recession</text>
  <text start="576.47" dur="4.74">depression is headed our way we have to</text>
  <text start="579.71" dur="4.11">know that they came out with a report</text>
  <text start="581.21" dur="5.58">saying well if we go into a recession</text>
  <text start="583.82" dur="4.8">depression the Fed is ready and prepared</text>
  <text start="586.79" dur="3.36">to do more QE all the way up to four</text>
  <text start="588.62" dur="3.63">trillion which we know it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="590.15" dur="4.35">much more than that former treasurer</text>
  <text start="592.25" dur="5.16">Treasury Secretary Larry Summers came</text>
  <text start="594.5" dur="6.63">out and he warns that the global central</text>

  <text start="601.13" dur="3.75">the next recession now it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="602.69" dur="4.5">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="604.88" dur="5.07">we&amp;#39;re supposed to be in this incredible</text>
  <text start="607.19" dur="6.45">recovery but what they keep talking</text>
  <text start="609.95" dur="8.61">about is the next recession the next</text>

  <text start="618.56" dur="3.99">probably sometime in the foreseeable</text>
  <text start="620.3" dur="6.06">future we&amp;#39;re going to have another</text>
  <text start="622.55" dur="6.57">recession and the central banks right</text>
  <text start="626.36" dur="8.1">now don&amp;#39;t really have the fuel in the</text>
  <text start="629.12" dur="9.51">tank to respond to the next crisis they</text>
  <text start="634.46" dur="8.4">need more control so we see already</text>
  <text start="638.63" dur="6.54">they&amp;#39;re setting up this propaganda to</text>
  <text start="642.86" dur="4.95">convince everyone they have nothing left</text>
  <text start="645.17" dur="4.32">so they&amp;#39;ll need more control of the</text>
  <text start="647.81" dur="4.56">economy the next time we go into a</text>
  <text start="649.49" dur="4.56">recession so we&amp;#39;ve been hearing this a</text>
  <text start="652.37" dur="6">couple of times where they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
