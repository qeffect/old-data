  <text start="138.37" dur="7.44">these governments right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="140.379" dur="7.741">doing everything they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="145.81" dur="5.16">keep the illusion alive that everything</text>
  <text start="148.12" dur="5.58">is fine remember we talked about</text>
  <text start="150.97" dur="5.519">Australia where they Canton said it was</text>
  <text start="153.7" dur="5.549">a technical glitch unemployment isn&amp;#39;t as</text>
  <text start="156.489" dur="7.651">good as we said we&amp;#39;re looking into it</text>
  <text start="159.249" dur="6.841">well we&amp;#39;ve learned that unemployment in</text>
  <text start="164.14" dur="4.85">Australia is a lot worse than the</text>
  <text start="166.09" dur="8.55">government is saying that jobs miracle</text>
  <text start="168.99" dur="8.14">is kind of gone at this point Australia</text>
  <text start="174.64" dur="7.73">reported that not only did total jobs</text>
  <text start="177.13" dur="10.23">tumble by 7900 far below to 13,000 plus</text>
  <text start="182.37" dur="8.23">forecast what&amp;#39;s actually happening right</text>
  <text start="187.36" dur="6">now is that the full time jobs plunged</text>
  <text start="190.6" dur="5.84">by forty thousand six hundred the</text>
  <text start="193.36" dur="7.92">biggest monthly plunge since October of</text>
  <text start="196.44" dur="6.7">2013 the end result of this sudden and</text>
  <text start="201.28" dur="3.6">unexpected bounce in unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="203.14" dur="5.879">from five point eight percent to six</text>
  <text start="204.88" dur="8.579">percent is some 20 basis point above the</text>
  <text start="209.019" dur="8.19">consensus estimate and the unemployment</text>
  <text start="213.459" dur="6.091">rate is continually moving up and this</text>
  <text start="217.209" dur="5.071">is what every government is falling back</text>
  <text start="219.55" dur="4.83">on they&amp;#39;re falling back on the ability</text>
  <text start="222.28" dur="5.52">to manipulate statistics until they get</text>
  <text start="224.38" dur="6.18">caught I mean we see this here in the</text>
  <text start="227.8" dur="5.58">United States quite a bit where right</text>
  <text start="230.56" dur="4.17">now almost every statistical piece of</text>
  <text start="233.38" dur="3.15">information that&amp;#39;s coming out of the</text>
  <text start="234.73" dur="4.95">government is completely fake phony and</text>
  <text start="236.53" dur="5.79">false everyone is calling the government</text>
  <text start="239.68" dur="5.58">out on this at this point you&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="242.32" dur="5.94">to tell me that we are how we are seeing</text>
  <text start="245.26" dur="5.16">all these layoffs and more layoffs are</text>
  <text start="248.26" dur="3.33">coming thousands upon thousands of</text>
  <text start="250.42" dur="3.12">people are being laid off stores are</text>
  <text start="251.59" dur="3.09">being closed and thousands upon</text>
  <text start="253.54" dur="3.03">thousands of people are being laid off</text>
  <text start="254.68" dur="7.02">from stores but the initial jobless</text>
  <text start="256.57" dur="8.099">claims they&amp;#39;re at 43 year lows yes they</text>
  <text start="261.7" dur="4.8">start trending up and now we sing that</text>
  <text start="264.669" dur="3.541">there&amp;#39;s being suppressed once again now</text>
  <text start="266.5" dur="4.71">remember those people who are working</text>
  <text start="268.21" dur="4.019">part times in retail stores it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="271.21" dur="3.84">interesting the way the government</text>
  <text start="272.229" dur="6.241">counts them is when they get a job let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="275.05" dur="5.369">count it as a full-time job when they</text>
  <text start="278.47" dur="4.199">are laid off from their job and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="280.419" dur="3.631">not working at least 30 hours a week or</text>
  <text start="282.669" dur="3.271">so in each state is a little different</text>
  <text start="284.05" dur="3.71">and they&amp;#39;re not earning a certain number</text>
  <text start="285.94" dur="6.3">at a certain dollar amount each week</text>
  <text start="287.76" dur="6.909">they&amp;#39;re not counted as being laid off so</text>
  <text start="292.24" dur="5.28">you could see it&amp;#39;s kind of one-sided and</text>
  <text start="294.669" dur="4.43">they really don&amp;#39;t account for everything</text>
  <text start="297.52" dur="5.25">at this point</text>
  <text start="299.099" dur="6.1">continuing claims though are continually</text>
  <text start="302.77" dur="5.399">surging up there at seven month highs</text>
  <text start="305.199" dur="5.701">and we&amp;#39;re seeing more layoffs American</text>
  <text start="308.169" dur="7.14">Express they&amp;#39;re announcing more layoffs</text>
  <text start="310.9" dur="7.289">the number not released just yet alberni</text>
  <text start="315.309" dur="5.311">Pacific Division mil 100 people netapp</text>
  <text start="318.189" dur="5.73">is laying off twelve percent of its</text>
  <text start="320.62" dur="6.449">workforce Yahoo in California is laying</text>
  <text start="323.919" dur="5.041">off 300-plus people and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="327.069" dur="6.09">see more and more of these layoffs to</text>
  <text start="328.96" dur="6.359">come down the pike here and what is very</text>
  <text start="333.159" dur="4.921">interesting about this is that we had</text>
  <text start="335.319" dur="3.991">all these manufacturing jobs and most of</text>
  <text start="338.08" dur="4.38">them are completely gone they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="339.31" dur="6.629">overseas those plants that are closing</text>
  <text start="342.46" dur="5.729">now those people are getting jobs either</text>
  <text start="345.939" dur="4.051">in party on part time retail if they can</text>
  <text start="348.189" dur="6.241">find any at this point or they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="349.99" dur="6.319">into the food service industry and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="354.43" dur="5.849">shown graphs many times where</text>
  <text start="356.309" dur="6.85">manufacturing is declining while food</text>
  <text start="360.279" dur="5.22">service bartenders are increasing we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="363.159" dur="6.081">removed about 1.5 million manufacturing</text>
  <text start="365.499" dur="7.021">jobs and we added about 1.5 million</text>
  <text start="369.24" dur="6.28">bartender foodservice people very</text>
  <text start="372.52" dur="6.899">interesting but it seems that this is</text>
  <text start="375.52" dur="6.959">all coming to an end the surge in</text>
  <text start="379.419" dur="4.56">bartenders and waiters that kind of</text>
  <text start="382.479" dur="3.601">saved the government&amp;#39;s recovery</text>
  <text start="383.979" dur="3.72">statistics because it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if</text>
  <text start="386.08" dur="3">you work in full-time part-time how much</text>
  <text start="387.699" dur="4.5">you&amp;#39;re making they&amp;#39;re just saying these</text>
  <text start="389.08" dur="5.329">jobs were added the rest of the people</text>
  <text start="392.199" dur="5.611">have fallen off they&amp;#39;re just not looking</text>
  <text start="394.409" dur="5.22">well the National Retail Association</text>
  <text start="397.81" dur="8.87">restaurant restaurant performance index</text>
  <text start="399.629" dur="11.59">the jobs recovery party is just ended</text>
  <text start="406.68" dur="6.93">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="411.219" dur="8.28">restaurant performance index is</text>
  <text start="413.61" dur="9.039">collapsing it went from back in 2015 the</text>
  <text start="419.499" dur="7.681">end of the year of 2015 from 103 it is</text>
  <text start="422.649" dur="7.411">down to 99.7 just like we saw back in</text>
  <text start="427.18" dur="4.469">two thousand eight it&amp;#39;s starting to look</text>
  <text start="430.06" dur="2.28">like things are falling apart because</text>
  <text start="431.649" dur="3.99">how many draw</text>
  <text start="432.34" dur="6">can you take from manufacturing and move</text>
  <text start="435.639" dur="5.25">them into the food service sector at a</text>
  <text start="438.34" dur="5.609">point it&amp;#39;s going to come to a screeching</text>
  <text start="440.889" dur="4.981">halt it&amp;#39;s finite and now we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="443.949" dur="4.591">to see things collapse and fall apart</text>
  <text start="445.87" dur="5.28">very very quickly we are seeing the</text>
  <text start="448.54" dur="4.11">housing recovery well that has come to</text>
  <text start="451.15" dur="4.68">an end we&amp;#39;re getting more indicators</text>
  <text start="452.65" dur="4.739">that housing the bubble has popped for</text>
  <text start="455.83" dur="5.94">the third week in a row mortgage</text>
  <text start="457.389" dur="6.921">applications for purchases slid and even</text>
  <text start="461.77" dur="7.35">more worrying is the architecture</text>
  <text start="464.31" dur="9.34">Billings they tumbled into contraction</text>
  <text start="469.12" dur="7.92">below 50 and we are starting to see that</text>
  <text start="473.65" dur="6.03">the bubbles in the economy are starting</text>
  <text start="477.04" dur="5.67">to pop everything is starting to fall</text>
  <text start="479.68" dur="4.14">apart we looked at all these indicators</text>
  <text start="482.71" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all these</text>
  <text start="483.82" dur="4.14">indicators and most of these indicators</text>
  <text start="486.13" dur="5.099">are a lot worse than two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="487.96" dur="5.91">and basically what we&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="491.229" dur="4.921">is we&amp;#39;re relying on the government with</text>
  <text start="493.87" dur="4.41">their statistical information and the</text>
  <text start="496.15" dur="4.59">stock market to convince the world that</text>
  <text start="498.28" dur="6.57">everything is fine actually this was the</text>
  <text start="500.74" dur="6.09">case back in 1929 where Europe and</text>
  <text start="504.85" dur="4.89">everywhere else was completely falling</text>
  <text start="506.83" dur="5.04">apart the US was saying there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="509.74" dur="3.719">problems here everything&amp;#39;s fine although</text>
  <text start="511.87" dur="3.9">soup lines those red lines don&amp;#39;t look at</text>
  <text start="513.459" dur="4.441">those look at the market all-time highs</text>
  <text start="515.77" dur="5.149">back then and then everything came</text>
  <text start="517.9" dur="6.689">crumbling down the same thing in 2008</text>
  <text start="520.919" dur="6.551">going into 2009 they told us everything</text>
  <text start="524.589" dur="5.611">was fine everything&amp;#39;s contained housing</text>
  <text start="527.47" dur="4.92">prices on houses never go down subprime</text>
  <text start="530.2" dur="4.47">contained we&amp;#39;re now forecasting any type</text>
  <text start="532.39" dur="5.79">of recession in the same year that we</text>
  <text start="534.67" dur="7.56">started the recession and think about</text>
  <text start="538.18" dur="7.29">how quickly everything fell apart one</text>
  <text start="542.23" dur="5.64">day you woke up and all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="545.47" dur="4.86">corporate media and everyone out there</text>
  <text start="547.87" dur="3.9">is out there going oh my god</text>
  <text start="550.33" dur="2.52">everything&amp;#39;s crashing what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="551.77" dur="4.46">here oh my god we&amp;#39;re in a recession</text>
  <text start="552.85" dur="5.79">going into depression we had the</text>
  <text start="556.23" dur="5.2">government saying is going to be riots</text>
  <text start="558.64" dur="4.47">on the street everyone was worried</text>
  <text start="561.43" dur="4.24">they&amp;#39;re talking about bail out I mean</text>
  <text start="563.11" dur="5.32">this all happened in a matter of</text>
  <text start="565.67" dur="7.11">couple of days the same thing is going</text>
  <text start="568.43" dur="7.32">to happen as we approach this incredible</text>
  <text start="572.78" dur="5.22">collapse that we&amp;#39;re going to see the</text>
  <text start="575.75" dur="4.68">philly fed right now the employment</text>
  <text start="578" dur="6.6">index that has plunged by the most since</text>
  <text start="580.43" dur="6.99">May of 2013 and we are starting to see</text>
  <text start="584.6" dur="5.67">that a lot of these indicators that we</text>
  <text start="587.42" dur="6.45">are seeing everything is declining very</text>
  <text start="590.27" dur="8.79">very quickly we&amp;#39;re seeing six straight</text>
  <text start="593.87" dur="7.41">months of contraction which tells us we</text>
  <text start="599.06" dur="5.6">are heading into a recession so a lot of</text>
  <text start="601.28" dur="6.24">these indicators that we are seeing is</text>
  <text start="604.66" dur="5.08">showing us that we are either in a</text>
  <text start="607.52" dur="5.79">recession or we&amp;#39;re heading towards a</text>
  <text start="609.74" dur="8.04">major depression and that is quite scary</text>
  <text start="613.31" dur="6.95">and there is nothing the government at</text>
  <text start="617.78" dur="5.94">this point that they will be able to do</text>
  <text start="620.26" dur="4.9">yes they can still manipulate yes they</text>
  <text start="623.72" dur="4.86">can try to keep the market up by</text>
  <text start="625.16" dur="6.66">manipulating it but this isn&amp;#39;t their job</text>
  <text start="628.58" dur="6.45">their job is not to manipulate</text>
  <text start="631.82" dur="6.47">everything to fool the people think</text>
  <text start="635.03" dur="7.74">about what they&amp;#39;re doing at this point</text>
  <text start="638.29" dur="7.75">does this really benefit the people well</text>
  <text start="642.77" dur="4.68">it might seem so on the surface because</text>
  <text start="646.04" dur="4.13">everyone&amp;#39;s saying oh everything is fine</text>
  <text start="647.45" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;re in a recovery we&amp;#39;ve recovered</text>
  <text start="650.17" dur="4.71">those who don&amp;#39;t think the economy is</text>
  <text start="652.34" dur="7.29">doing well they&amp;#39;re just lunatics and</text>
  <text start="654.88" dur="6.36">then it crashes and of course what</text>
  <text start="659.63" dur="5.88">happens is they blame this on other</text>
  <text start="661.24" dur="6.16">foreign groups or other countries or</text>
  <text start="665.51" dur="3.81">anything else because they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="667.4" dur="4.8">be blamed for what happened after they</text>
  <text start="669.32" dur="5.49">told us everything was fine they did sit</text>
  <text start="672.2" dur="8.64">back in two thousand eight they blamed</text>
