  <text start="145.879" dur="6.211">a sudden the markets turned around and</text>

  <text start="152.09" dur="6.6">better and the market went into the</text>
  <text start="154.73" dur="7.619">positive range this is the power of the</text>
  <text start="158.69" dur="5.129">magic wand we know the stock market has</text>
  <text start="162.349" dur="5.31">been manipulated for a very low</text>
  <text start="163.819" dur="6.331">time trump is sending a message to the</text>
  <text start="167.659" dur="4.95">central banks to the deep state that he</text>
  <text start="170.15" dur="3.059">has full control of what is going on</text>
  <text start="172.609" dur="2.791">right now</text>
  <text start="173.209" dur="4.98">now again does this mean he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="175.4" dur="4.11">continually do this no most likely he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="188.359" dur="6.39">control the market we have full control</text>
  <text start="191.719" dur="7.25">right now remember he has certain people</text>
  <text start="194.749" dur="10.44">in certain positions for a reason and</text>
  <text start="198.969" dur="7.871">the plan is on schedule but we see</text>
  <text start="205.189" dur="4.05">something very interesting happening</text>
  <text start="206.84" dur="4.259">right now and we&amp;#39;re starting to see it</text>
  <text start="209.239" dur="3.271">in publications like the Aspen time</text>
  <text start="211.099" dur="3.84">which I&amp;#39;ll get into in just a minute</text>
  <text start="212.51" dur="5.009">where they&amp;#39;re talking about the Fed and</text>
  <text start="214.939" dur="6.061">this might be just opinions but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="217.519" dur="5.041">talking about the Fed and they&amp;#39;re asking</text>
  <text start="221" dur="4.409">people to question what the Fed is</text>
  <text start="222.56" dur="6.09">actually doing this is the beginning</text>
  <text start="225.409" dur="6.181">stages this is what Trump is starting</text>
  <text start="228.65" dur="5.459">here by continually contradicting the</text>
  <text start="231.59" dur="4.799">Fed he wants everyone to question the</text>
  <text start="234.109" dur="3.541">Fed why is he contradicting the Fed</text>
  <text start="236.389" dur="2.791">because eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="237.65" dur="3.72">happen as we know he has Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="239.18" dur="4.619">hanging on the wall he&amp;#39;s going to go in</text>
  <text start="241.37" dur="5.429">for the kill which means he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="243.799" dur="5.94">go after the central banking system this</text>
  <text start="246.799" dur="5.64">is why he&amp;#39;s dropping all this bread now</text>
  <text start="249.739" dur="7.951">we know that Trump is going to meet G</text>
  <text start="252.439" dur="8.091">Jinping or Trade representatives are</text>
  <text start="257.69" dur="5.789">going to meet those individuals in China</text>
  <text start="260.53" dur="5.77">but I do believe that Trump and G will</text>
  <text start="263.479" dur="4.861">most likely meet and form a trade deal</text>
  <text start="266.3" dur="4.47">and it looks like they&amp;#39;re preparing to</text>
  <text start="268.34" dur="5.819">have a negotiating team in Beijing on</text>
  <text start="270.77" dur="4.889">January 7th of 2019 now if this is</text>
  <text start="274.159" dur="4.5">accurate this would be the first</text>
  <text start="275.659" dur="5.221">face-to-face delegation since President</text>
  <text start="278.659" dur="3.781">Trump and Chairman G outlined the</text>
  <text start="280.88" dur="3.9">structure for strategic trade</text>
  <text start="282.44" dur="6.199">discussions during the g20 meeting in</text>
  <text start="284.78" dur="6.54">buenos RS now if we have to remember</text>
  <text start="288.639" dur="5.421">Trump is saying that they are working on</text>
  <text start="291.32" dur="4.41">this incredible deal</text>
  <text start="294.06" dur="4.56">think about what he&amp;#39;s doing right now</text>
  <text start="295.73" dur="5.76">there&amp;#39;s been no other president that</text>
  <text start="298.62" dur="6.33">would or could or has ever considered</text>
  <text start="301.49" dur="6.16">publicly taking on this dual economic</text>
  <text start="304.95" dur="5.4">and diplomatic challenge not only is</text>
  <text start="307.65" dur="5.61">Trump taking on China he is</text>
  <text start="310.35" dur="4.65">simultaneously taking on every financial</text>
  <text start="313.26" dur="5.04">interest who previously acquiesced to</text>
  <text start="315" dur="5.669">China because they saw no option only</text>
  <text start="318.3" dur="4.38">and I do mean only President Trump has</text>
  <text start="320.669" dur="3.811">the cunning to take on China Wall Street</text>
  <text start="322.68" dur="3.75">the multinational bank system</text>
  <text start="324.48" dur="5.159">IMF the World Trade Organization and</text>
  <text start="326.43" dur="7.23">every vested global politician while</text>
  <text start="329.639" dur="8.131">simultaneously taking on Beijing the Fed</text>
  <text start="333.66" dur="9.63">all at the same exact time this is what</text>
  <text start="337.77" dur="10.98">we see happening right now because the</text>
  <text start="343.29" dur="8.76">time is ticking down the central bank</text>
  <text start="348.75" dur="4.74">system is collapsing under its own</text>
  <text start="352.05" dur="6.03">weight</text>
  <text start="353.49" dur="9.21">of debt because the central bank system</text>
  <text start="358.08" dur="7.17">can only last so long before everything</text>
  <text start="362.7" dur="4.65">starts to break down they can&amp;#39;t raise</text>
  <text start="365.25" dur="4.2">interest rates they can keep interest</text>
  <text start="367.35" dur="4.71">rates the same because what happens is</text>
  <text start="369.45" dur="4.2">as more and more debt is piled on you</text>
  <text start="372.06" dur="3.75">have to go into the negative tour-</text>
  <text start="373.65" dur="4.44">territory with interest rates because</text>
  <text start="375.81" dur="4.56">the interest on the debt becomes</text>
  <text start="378.09" dur="4.38">unsustainable and once you move into</text>
  <text start="380.37" dur="4.769">negative territory which Europe is</text>
  <text start="382.47" dur="5.069">already there what happens why would you</text>
  <text start="385.139" dur="4.65">want to keep money in the bank you would</text>
  <text start="387.539" dur="4.291">put it other places they want you to put</text>
  <text start="389.789" dur="4.801">it in the stock market but many people</text>
  <text start="391.83" dur="4.649">weren&amp;#39;t doing that maybe people will</text>
  <text start="394.59" dur="3.87">just hold on to it they want you to</text>
  <text start="396.479" dur="3.81">spend it because you&amp;#39;re not earning</text>
  <text start="398.46" dur="3.75">money in the bank you&amp;#39;re actually losing</text>
  <text start="400.289" dur="5.671">money in the bank but that wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="402.21" dur="8.79">happening either why because the central</text>
  <text start="405.96" dur="9.079">bank system doesn&amp;#39;t allow the population</text>
  <text start="411" dur="8.88">to grow as the central bank system is</text>
  <text start="415.039" dur="8.461">growing in debt it can&amp;#39;t happen at the</text>
  <text start="419.88" dur="7.71">same time and what happens is you see</text>
  <text start="423.5" dur="7.63">less and less jobs low-paying job</text>
  <text start="427.59" dur="5.82">and we have to remember the deep state</text>
  <text start="431.13" dur="4.56">in the central bank they were moving all</text>
  <text start="433.41" dur="3.75">of the jobs in the manufacturing in</text>
  <text start="435.69" dur="3">companies out of this country because</text>
  <text start="437.16" dur="5.58">they were preparing for something</text>
  <text start="438.69" dur="6.9">completely different so we&amp;#39;re at the end</text>
  <text start="442.74" dur="4.47">stage of this central bank system and</text>
  <text start="445.59" dur="5.19">Trump knows it and this is why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="447.21" dur="7.77">taking on so much right now because</text>
  <text start="450.78" dur="6.63">there is no choice Trump needs to</text>
  <text start="454.98" dur="4.8">prepare the country for this transition</text>
  <text start="457.41" dur="4.62">from when this system collapses and he</text>
  <text start="459.78" dur="3.93">needs to make the move and take out the</text>
  <text start="462.03" dur="6.06">central banking system all at the same</text>
  <text start="463.71" dur="7.23">time and bring back manufacturing why</text>
  <text start="468.09" dur="6.51">all this is happening and this is a</text>
  <text start="470.94" dur="5.07">tough thing to do because remember the</text>
  <text start="474.6" dur="4.8">deep state the central bank&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="476.01" dur="4.8">moved everything out of this country now</text>
  <text start="479.4" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s very interesting coming out of the</text>
  <text start="480.81" dur="4.26">Aspen times and we know that Trump has</text>
  <text start="483.3" dur="3.78">been contradicting the Fed saying that</text>
  <text start="485.07" dur="4.41">fet the you know the major thing wrong</text>
  <text start="487.08" dur="4.58">with this economy is the Fed if the</text>
  <text start="489.48" dur="4.71">market goes down it&amp;#39;s the feds fault</text>
  <text start="491.66" dur="4.96">it&amp;#39;s ridiculous to have the interest</text>
  <text start="494.19" dur="4.46">rates moving up right now it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="496.62" dur="5.16">make any sense with debt coming due</text>
  <text start="498.65" dur="4.75">maybe I should fire Powell and he</text>
  <text start="501.78" dur="4.11">continually goes on and on and on all</text>
  <text start="503.4" dur="4.2">about this and he continually tweets</text>
  <text start="505.89" dur="3.93">about this and the mainstream media they</text>
  <text start="507.6" dur="5.51">carry his tweets the message is getting</text>
  <text start="509.82" dur="6.33">out to the people but in the Aspen time</text>
  <text start="513.11" dur="4.809">they wrote a little opinion piece about</text>
  <text start="516.15" dur="5.55">the Federal Reserve and how it promotes</text>
  <text start="517.919" dur="6.871">foreign interest and corruption and this</text>
  <text start="521.7" dur="6.98">is part of the article here a thousand</text>
  <text start="524.79" dur="6.23">million equals 1 billion in 2017</text>
  <text start="528.68" dur="6.07">Americans spent 58 billion for education</text>
  <text start="531.02" dur="5.73">another 70 billion for vets 310 billion</text>
  <text start="534.75" dur="4.83">for interest on our national debt</text>
  <text start="536.75" dur="5.95">imagine what 310 billion every year</text>
  <text start="539.58" dur="6.33">could do for our beloved country why</text>
  <text start="542.7" dur="5.73">imagine we not we need not pay a penny</text>
  <text start="545.91" dur="5.82">of interest when we issue our currency</text>

  <text start="590.32" dur="5.31">done in the past it can be done now the</text>
  <text start="594.04" dur="4.71">other part of this someone was answering</text>
  <text start="595.63" dur="6.96">to this article is that the 1913 Act</text>
  <text start="598.75" dur="6.15">gave back to the British banking cabal</text>

  <text start="644.95" dur="7.29">right to know what is going on and they</text>
  <text start="647.2" dur="6.45">wouldn&amp;#39;t loan us the currency where we</text>
  <text start="652.24" dur="3.03">would have to pay it back which is</text>
  <text start="653.65" dur="3.81">completely impossible because think</text>
  <text start="655.27" dur="5.46">about when the system started the</text>

  <text start="662.98" dur="5.88">there&amp;#39;s interest attached now the</text>
  <text start="665.53" dur="6.15">government owes say a dollar 10 well if</text>
  <text start="668.86" dur="5.84">that is the first dollar where does the</text>

  <text start="674.7" dur="4.45">they can&amp;#39;t there&amp;#39;s nowhere to get it</text>
  <text start="677.05" dur="4.26">except where the central bank the only</text>
  <text start="679.15" dur="5.46">way to get it is to borrow another</text>
  <text start="681.31" dur="5.49">dollar and now they really borrowed 90</text>
  <text start="684.61" dur="3.69">cents because they had a bait back that</text>
  <text start="686.8" dur="4.59">ten cents but there&amp;#39;s interest on that</text>
  <text start="688.3" dur="4.62">other dollar which is ten cents and they</text>

  <text start="704.74" dur="6.77">which is the interest on the debt it was</text>
  <text start="708.25" dur="6.03">created this way to enslave the people</text>
  <text start="711.51" dur="6.19">so we could never get out of this this</text>
  <text start="714.28" dur="7.19">is why when you look at a dollar bill it</text>
  <text start="717.7" dur="8.1">says Federal Reserve Note because it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="721.47" dur="5.38">debt note yes it has US Treasury and</text>
  <text start="725.8" dur="4.62">they may try to make it look official</text>
  <text start="726.85" dur="6.09">but in reality this is a debt note</text>
  <text start="730.42" dur="5.07">because you just don&amp;#39;t owe that five</text>
  <text start="732.94" dur="4.98">dollars or that ten dollars back you owe</text>
  <text start="735.49" dur="6">the ten dollars with interest attached</text>
  <text start="737.92" dur="7.08">and this is why many people in this</text>
  <text start="741.49" dur="7.83">country cannot get ahead the majority of</text>
  <text start="745" dur="7.14">the people are stuck in this central</text>
  <text start="749.32" dur="4.46">bank enslavement that they can never get</text>
  <text start="752.14" dur="4.17">out of and</text>
  <text start="753.78" dur="7.03">this is the way this system works yes</text>
  <text start="756.31" dur="9.23">you&amp;#39;ll have the 1% the the 5% maybe even</text>
  <text start="760.81" dur="8.04">the 10% that kind of make it out of this</text>
  <text start="765.54" dur="5.26">system in some way but not really</text>
  <text start="768.85" dur="3.96">because they still owe and they try to</text>
  <text start="770.8" dur="5.31">maneuver different loopholes and things</text>
  <text start="772.81" dur="5.88">like that to get around all the laws but</text>
  <text start="776.11" dur="4.8">the majority of the people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="778.69" dur="5.67">enslaved and this is exactly what they</text>
  <text start="780.91" dur="6.84">want they want countries they want</text>
  <text start="784.36" dur="7.23">people enslaved to them because this is</text>
  <text start="787.75" dur="7.29">how they can control everyone and here</text>
  <text start="791.59" dur="6.66">we are the idea that the Fed right now</text>
  <text start="795.04" dur="6.14">is not working for the best interests of</text>
  <text start="798.25" dur="6.63">the people it is spreading right now and</text>
  <text start="801.18" dur="7.74">fingers are being pointed at the central</text>
  <text start="804.88" dur="6.57">bank and this is going to continue and</text>
  <text start="808.92" dur="4.3">Trump is going to be out there showing</text>
  <text start="811.45" dur="4.1">the central bank showing the deep state</text>
  <text start="813.22" dur="5.1">that he has full control of all</text>
  <text start="815.55" dur="4.81">manipulation why do you think the</text>
  <text start="818.32" dur="3.24">mainstream media and all the fine just</text>
  <text start="820.36" dur="2.94">don&amp;#39;t come out and say hey listen we</text>
  <text start="821.56" dur="4.41">know what you&amp;#39;re doing you&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="823.3" dur="5.16">manipulation well they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="825.97" dur="4.86">say that because it&amp;#39;s their manipulation</text>
  <text start="828.46" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;d be calling out themselves they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="830.83" dur="4.86">be calling out Obama they&amp;#39;d be calling</text>
  <text start="833.02" dur="5.99">out every single president and the</text>
  <text start="835.69" dur="7.02">central bank they&amp;#39;re not going to do it</text>
  <text start="839.01" dur="5.44">because the system then the central bank</text>
  <text start="842.71" dur="3.57">system which is automatically crash</text>
  <text start="844.45" dur="2.28">because everyone would say well wait a</text>
  <text start="846.28" dur="3.78">minute</text>
  <text start="846.73" dur="4.97">this whole thing&amp;#39;s manipulated from the</text>
  <text start="850.06" dur="5.7">central bank and all the presidents on</text>
  <text start="851.7" dur="7.32">the government is corrupt and Trump is</text>
  <text start="855.76" dur="6.69">using this against them to take down</text>
  <text start="859.02" dur="6.76">their system and wake the people up to</text>
  <text start="862.45" dur="6.33">understand how bad this central bank</text>
  <text start="865.78" dur="6.74">system is because it is worse than we</text>
  <text start="868.78" dur="6.93">even know at this point you think oh</text>
  <text start="872.52" dur="5.14">when we hear stories of the central bank</text>
  <text start="875.71" dur="4.44">where we have the records of the central</text>
  <text start="877.66" dur="5.22">bank giving funds to other foreign</text>
  <text start="880.15" dur="5.91">central banks and doing other things and</text>
  <text start="882.88" dur="5.01">giving the Swiss central bank the</text>
  <text start="886.06" dur="4.08">ability to create currency out of thin</text>
  <text start="887.89" dur="4.95">air and invest it into the stock market</text>
  <text start="890.14" dur="6.72">to prop it up this is just the beginning</text>
  <text start="892.84" dur="6.21">because this is why the Fed and the rest</text>
  <text start="896.86" dur="3.72">of the central bank&amp;#39;s this is why they</text>
  <text start="899.05" dur="3.41">don&amp;#39;t want you looking into their books</text>
  <text start="900.58" dur="5.1">because they&amp;#39;re hiding everything</text>
  <text start="902.46" dur="4.99">because if the American people or the</text>
  <text start="905.68" dur="3.96">rest of the countries around the world</text>
  <text start="907.45" dur="4.92">find out what they were really doing and</text>
  <text start="909.64" dur="4.89">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now their</text>
  <text start="912.37" dur="4.44">entire central bank system would</text>
  <text start="914.53" dur="4.38">collapse that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re afraid to</text>
  <text start="916.81" dur="4.2">show everyone this is why they have</text>
