  <text start="128.29" dur="7.35">system and this is why early on cue</text>
  <text start="132.34" dur="6.69">needed to mention that the rothschild</text>
  <text start="135.64" dur="5.129">they control most of the world the</text>
  <text start="139.03" dur="5.76">private western central banks in many</text>

  <text start="147.31" dur="6.69">acts like it&amp;#39;s above the law and it is a</text>
  <text start="151.299" dur="7.771">private corporation controlled by the</text>
  <text start="154" dur="7.109">Rothschilds Trump and the Patriots they</text>

  <text start="164.709" dur="7.711">they understand that their plan was to</text>
  <text start="168.36" dur="6.579">create an event bring us to war have the</text>
  <text start="172.42" dur="5.25">United States lose this war the</text>

  <text start="177.67" dur="6.629">bankers the elite the deep state they</text>
  <text start="180.43" dur="6.75">then would have more control and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="184.299" dur="7.5">the name of the game controlling the</text>
  <text start="187.18" dur="9.3">world through debt think about what</text>
  <text start="191.799" dur="6.75">Trump&amp;#39;s specialty is he deals with debt</text>
  <text start="196.48" dur="3.75">and we&amp;#39;re gonna be going into that in</text>
  <text start="198.549" dur="4.08">just a minute but first let&amp;#39;s go out to</text>
  <text start="200.23" dur="6.21">the UK once again there&amp;#39;s only 36 days</text>
  <text start="202.629" dur="7.2">left until brexit day and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="206.44" dur="8.49">clear now that may well she might need</text>
  <text start="209.829" dur="6.75">to ask the EU for an extension now some</text>
  <text start="214.93" dur="3.99">people are saying it&amp;#39;s going to be for</text>
  <text start="216.579" dur="6.511">three months others are saying maybe two</text>
  <text start="218.92" dur="9.569">years or maybe they can break away from</text>
  <text start="223.09" dur="8.64">the EU with no deal now the EU doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="228.489" dur="4.771">want this to happen they just don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="231.73" dur="4.11">them to break away I think what the e</text>
  <text start="233.26" dur="5.4">u--&amp;#39;s plan is because they understood</text>
  <text start="235.84" dur="6.239">and they know that the people of the UK</text>
  <text start="238.66" dur="6.57">are not going along with their deal and</text>
  <text start="242.079" dur="5.701">I said this many many reports ago where</text>
  <text start="245.23" dur="5.339">I do believe the EU is going to try to</text>
  <text start="247.78" dur="5.579">keep them in limbo where they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="250.569" dur="5.1">continually say okay we grant you an</text>
  <text start="253.359" dur="3.511">extension and we&amp;#39;ll give you three</text>
  <text start="255.669" dur="2.581">months we&amp;#39;ll give you six months we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="256.87" dur="5.88">give you nine months and during this</text>
  <text start="258.25" dur="7.86">period of time they don&amp;#39;t leave and they</text>
  <text start="262.75" dur="5.639">actually stay there in limbo and people</text>
  <text start="266.11" dur="4.89">think the brexit is going on but really</text>
  <text start="268.389" dur="4.681">nothing is happening now remember the</text>
  <text start="271" dur="3.599">central bankers they&amp;#39;ve been using</text>
  <text start="273.07" dur="5.43">fear-mongering</text>
  <text start="274.599" dur="7.621">to scare everyone into their deal I mean</text>
  <text start="278.5" dur="6.599">if we go back in time the EU other</text>
  <text start="282.22" dur="4.379">Parliament members they predicted that</text>
  <text start="285.099" dur="3.991">Britain would already have experienced</text>
  <text start="286.599" dur="5.13">hundreds of thousand job losses and a</text>
  <text start="289.09" dur="7.33">technical recession by now as a result</text>
  <text start="291.729" dur="9.121">of the leave vote</text>
  <text start="296.42" dur="8.64">but it didn&amp;#39;t happen why not because the</text>
  <text start="300.85" dur="10.15">UK they&amp;#39;re not in trouble it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="305.06" dur="8.79">the EU the EU is in the doldrums with</text>
  <text start="311" dur="4.44">Germany economy stagnant France in a</text>
  <text start="313.85" dur="6.21">state of low-level civil insurrection</text>
  <text start="315.44" dur="6.24">and Italy in a recession and if you look</text>
  <text start="320.06" dur="7.55">at Greece Spain and so forth</text>
  <text start="321.68" dur="5.93">the youth unemployment is really high</text>
  <text start="327.64" dur="9.91">the UK right now they have a record</text>
  <text start="331.79" dur="8.76">budget surplus the EU they&amp;#39;re in trouble</text>
  <text start="337.55" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re facing a black hole in its</text>
  <text start="340.55" dur="5.01">budget if the United Kingdom leaves</text>
  <text start="342.11" dur="6.45">without a deal this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="345.56" dur="4.8">scaring everyone because their system</text>
  <text start="348.56" dur="5.1">falls apart they&amp;#39;re the ones who are in</text>
  <text start="350.36" dur="7.08">trouble and if you notice everything</text>
  <text start="353.66" dur="8.1">they predicted did not happen but I do</text>
  <text start="357.44" dur="8.4">believe these central bankers these</text>
  <text start="361.76" dur="7.26">elite they will try to keep this brexit</text>
  <text start="365.84" dur="6">in a limbo type of state and I believe</text>
  <text start="369.02" dur="5.01">that people need to push the</text>
  <text start="371.84" dur="4.59">parliamentary members and everyone else</text>
  <text start="374.03" dur="5.4">to say listen let&amp;#39;s just break away and</text>
  <text start="376.43" dur="5.82">let&amp;#39;s see what happens because you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="379.43" dur="7.41">gonna see the EU start to have problems</text>
  <text start="382.25" dur="8.13">the UK will be fine we see christine</text>
  <text start="386.84" dur="6.75">lagarde she&amp;#39;s laying out the problems</text>
  <text start="390.38" dur="5.7">that were encountering right now and she</text>
  <text start="393.59" dur="4.44">said some very interesting things now</text>
  <text start="396.08" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;ve always been talking about debt we</text>
  <text start="398.03" dur="4.5">know debt is a major major problem a lot</text>
  <text start="400.85" dur="4.38">of people don&amp;#39;t think it is but it</text>
  <text start="402.53" dur="5.79">really is Lagarde said there&amp;#39;s three</text>
  <text start="405.23" dur="7.26">categories of risk number one the</text>
  <text start="408.32" dur="7.68">tensions between the US and China about</text>
  <text start="412.49" dur="5.34">you know the tariffs and the trade but</text>
  <text start="416" dur="6.12">she ended up saying well that&amp;#39;s really a</text>
  <text start="417.83" dur="7.22">minimal type of impact yeah that is not</text>
  <text start="422.12" dur="4.95">really an impact that&amp;#39;s not the problem</text>
  <text start="425.05" dur="5.26">so the impact</text>
  <text start="427.07" dur="5.19">is not the tariffs the trade deals that</text>
  <text start="430.31" dur="3.87">Trump is working out right now they</text>
  <text start="432.26" dur="3.93">tried to make it seem like this was</text>
  <text start="434.18" dur="3.66">going to be a big problem but that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="436.19" dur="3.87">the problem the global economy is having</text>
  <text start="437.84" dur="5.13">she said the second cloud on the horizon</text>
  <text start="440.06" dur="4.38">the second risk is the financial risk</text>
  <text start="442.97" dur="3.45">where we are currently in a position</text>
  <text start="444.44" dur="5.6">where many countries many corporations</text>
  <text start="446.42" dur="5.85">many households are heavily indebted in</text>
  <text start="450.04" dur="4.51">many countries and non domestic</text>
  <text start="452.27" dur="4.2">currencies and where we know that the</text>
  <text start="454.55" dur="4.23">financing costs will probably go up and</text>
  <text start="456.47" dur="7.26">the dollar is strong the debt problem is</text>
  <text start="458.78" dur="7.83">real this is the main problem the more</text>
  <text start="463.73" dur="5.1">debt there is the harder it is for</text>
  <text start="466.61" dur="4.37">countries the harder it is for people</text>
  <text start="468.83" dur="6">the harder it is for businesses they</text>
  <text start="470.98" dur="6.76">can&amp;#39;t operate with such a huge debt load</text>
  <text start="474.83" dur="5.52">countries cannot operate with a huge</text>
  <text start="477.74" dur="5.31">debt load think about your family if</text>
  <text start="480.35" dur="5.19">you&amp;#39;re making fifty thousand dollars a</text>
  <text start="483.05" dur="6.12">year let&amp;#39;s just use that number and you</text>
  <text start="485.54" dur="6.02">keep piling on debt and let&amp;#39;s just say</text>
  <text start="489.17" dur="5.7">that you have a credit card with</text>
  <text start="491.56" dur="6.01">unlimited funds just like the Federal</text>
  <text start="494.87" dur="7.05">Reserve can continually print and the</text>
  <text start="497.57" dur="7.37">government can continually borrow let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="501.92" dur="6.27">say you can continually borrow and</text>
  <text start="504.94" dur="7.63">you&amp;#39;re only bringing in 50,000 those</text>
  <text start="508.19" dur="8.61">your tax receipts can you sustain the</text>
  <text start="512.57" dur="7.68">debt as you continually bring it on no</text>
  <text start="516.8" dur="8.88">you can what happens you go bankrupt</text>
  <text start="520.25" dur="9.78">that is the problem that&amp;#39;s why the</text>
  <text start="525.68" dur="6.81">global economy is slowing down it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="530.03" dur="6.9">the tariffs it&amp;#39;s not what Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="532.49" dur="11.31">it is the central bank bankers economic</text>
  <text start="536.93" dur="8.67">system period now Trump has been talking</text>
  <text start="543.8" dur="4.47">about the Federal Reserve he contradicts</text>
  <text start="545.6" dur="5.04">the Federal Reserve he&amp;#39;s controlling the</text>
  <text start="548.27" dur="4.83">Federal Reserve right now which he needs</text>
  <text start="550.64" dur="4.83">to do he needs to be reelected once</text>
  <text start="553.1" dur="5.22">again because remember it takes time to</text>
  <text start="555.47" dur="5.109">put this plan into place to make sure</text>
  <text start="558.32" dur="5.929">that everything is set up</text>
  <text start="560.579" dur="6.341">correctly to bring down these treasonous</text>
  <text start="564.249" dur="5.491">traitors and to go after the central</text>
  <text start="566.92" dur="4.89">bank we know that Trump likes gold we</text>
  <text start="569.74" dur="5.699">know that Q is mentioned that gold will</text>
  <text start="571.81" dur="6.99">bring down the central bank system and I</text>
  <text start="575.439" dur="7.94">do believe that it&amp;#39;s not just having the</text>
  <text start="578.8" dur="7.5">gold but having the manipulation of gold</text>
  <text start="583.379" dur="7.661">come to an end and when that comes to an</text>
  <text start="586.3" dur="7.529">end that right there will destroy the</text>
  <text start="591.04" dur="5.339">central bank currency system actually if</text>
  <text start="593.829" dur="3.99">they end the manipulation around the</text>
  <text start="596.379" dur="6.091">world and if you really think about it</text>
  <text start="597.819" dur="8.901">and gold moves up two thousand three</text>
  <text start="602.47" dur="7.489">thousand five thousand around the world</text>
  <text start="606.72" dur="6.789">what happens to all these private</text>
  <text start="609.959" dur="5.61">western central bank currency systems</text>
  <text start="613.509" dur="5.01">that are running in these countries</text>
  <text start="615.569" dur="5.921">starts to look really bad for the</text>
  <text start="618.519" dur="7.021">central banks and people then start to</text>
  <text start="621.49" dur="6.51">realize whoa this is really bad we</text>
  <text start="625.54" dur="4.44">better get out of the dollar we better</text>
  <text start="628" dur="3.449">get out of this currency this that</text>
  <text start="629.98" dur="4.049">currency and we better move into</text>
  <text start="631.449" dur="7.5">something that has strength that is</text>
  <text start="634.029" dur="7.41">solid solid as gold and I do believe</text>
  <text start="638.949" dur="5.971">this is where they&amp;#39;re gonna be pushing</text>
  <text start="641.439" dur="7.551">this but we have to deal with the debt</text>
  <text start="644.92" dur="8.18">situation the debt situation is</text>
  <text start="648.99" dur="8.529">unsustainable and if we go back in time</text>
  <text start="653.1" dur="6.31">we can see that Trump has been talking</text>
  <text start="657.519" dur="3.451">about the debt for quite a while he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="659.41" dur="3.869">been talking about gold he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="660.97" dur="5.19">talking about the Fed he&amp;#39;s been talking</text>
  <text start="663.279" dur="6.12">about the debt they&amp;#39;ve been planning</text>
  <text start="666.16" dur="6.57">this and I say they the Patriots for a</text>
  <text start="669.399" dur="7.92">very long time let me just go back to</text>
  <text start="672.73" dur="7.789">August 7 2015 Trump said at Fox News at</text>
  <text start="677.319" dur="7.291">real Donald Trump when you have 18 to 19</text>
  <text start="680.519" dur="8.641">trillion in debt they need someone like</text>
  <text start="684.61" dur="8.35">me to straighten it out</text>
  <text start="689.16" dur="8.38">why because he knows what to do</text>
  <text start="692.96" dur="9.12">with debt let&amp;#39;s go to June 21st 2016 I</text>
  <text start="697.54" dur="7.39">am the king of debt that has been great</text>
  <text start="702.08" dur="5.64">for me as a businessman but is bad for</text>
  <text start="704.93" dur="8.909">the country I made a fortune off of debt</text>
  <text start="707.72" dur="9.36">we&amp;#39;ll fix us he understands debt he</text>
  <text start="713.839" dur="5.791">knows how to maneuver around debt he</text>
  <text start="717.08" dur="6.18">knows how to get us out of this central</text>
  <text start="719.63" dur="7.05">bank debt situation that&amp;#39;s why Trump is</text>
  <text start="723.26" dur="7.949">there Trump is there to drain the</text>
  <text start="726.68" dur="6.24">economic swamp but again there are</text>
  <text start="731.209" dur="5.431">certain things that have to come first</text>
  <text start="732.92" dur="5.7">before he can get to that area and we</text>
  <text start="736.64" dur="3.29">can see already with the Mueller report</text>
  <text start="738.62" dur="4.159">that&amp;#39;s going to be coming out very soon</text>
  <text start="739.93" dur="5.14">with the investigation that is ending</text>
  <text start="742.779" dur="5.231">everything is gonna start to kick into</text>
  <text start="745.07" dur="4.26">high gear and we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot of</text>
  <text start="748.01" dur="4.829">things that we&amp;#39;ve never seen before</text>
  <text start="749.33" dur="5.91">especially with the economy he just</text>
  <text start="752.839" dur="6.451">started the first phase where he had to</text>
  <text start="755.24" dur="7.55">bring back the manufacturing jobs bring</text>
  <text start="759.29" dur="6.799">back businesses reduce regulations</text>
