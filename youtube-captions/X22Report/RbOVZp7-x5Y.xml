  <text start="82.45" dur="4.29">aren&amp;#39;t buying what the Fed is saying</text>
  <text start="84.07" dur="4.939">that they can&amp;#39;t raise the interest rates</text>
  <text start="86.74" dur="5.1">because the economy is still recovering</text>
  <text start="89.009" dur="5.801">we know that this economy is not</text>
  <text start="91.84" dur="4.559">recovering at all and we understand the</text>
  <text start="94.81" dur="4.53">whole economy is based on the petro</text>
  <text start="96.399" dur="5.22">dollar system and when we take a closer</text>
  <text start="99.34" dur="4.86">look at the petro dollar system what do</text>
  <text start="101.619" dur="6.471">we actually see here well what do we</text>
  <text start="104.2" dur="6.96">know about it well we know the countries</text>
  <text start="108.09" dur="6.759">use the petro dollar system especially</text>
  <text start="111.16" dur="5.7">in the Middle East to sell the oil which</text>
  <text start="114.849" dur="5.58">means other countries need to hold the</text>
  <text start="116.86" dur="7.59">petro dollar in reserves to purchase</text>
  <text start="120.429" dur="7.56">this oil but we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="124.45" dur="6.059">energy exporting countries they are set</text>
  <text start="127.989" dur="4.951">to pull their petrodollars out of the</text>
  <text start="130.509" dur="5.521">world&amp;#39;s market this year actually when</text>
  <text start="132.94" dur="5.549">we take a look at this we see oil</text>
  <text start="136.03" dur="5.31">producers are now liquidating their</text>
  <text start="138.489" dur="7.381">petro dollar assets at a frenzied pace</text>
  <text start="141.34" dur="10.979">and if we look back in time what do we</text>
  <text start="145.87" dur="9.93">see well back in 2004-2005 we see that</text>
  <text start="152.319" dur="7.831">the petro dollar exports were very high</text>
  <text start="155.8" dur="8.49">there around 300 billion US dollars all</text>
  <text start="160.15" dur="10.05">the way up to 500 billion in 2006</text>
  <text start="164.29" dur="8.789">we are now close to zero and we see when</text>
  <text start="170.2" dur="7.489">we when we zoom in on this Latin America</text>
  <text start="173.079" dur="9">countries they were one of the largest</text>
  <text start="177.689" dur="6.371">now non-existent we know a lot of their</text>
  <text start="182.079" dur="3.601">economies are falling apart we</text>
  <text start="184.06" dur="4.259">understand a lot of the Latin American</text>
  <text start="185.68" dur="5.399">countries are dealing not in the dollar</text>
  <text start="188.319" dur="5.971">they&amp;#39;re making deals with China Russia</text>
  <text start="191.079" dur="6.091">we see the Middle East markets very</text>
  <text start="194.29" dur="6.919">small portion of that about 30 billion</text>
  <text start="197.17" dur="9.649">dollars worth we see the Asian markets</text>
  <text start="201.209" dur="10.18">completely gone and as time goes on</text>
  <text start="206.819" dur="6.7">these countries they&amp;#39;re looking to get</text>
  <text start="211.389" dur="4.201">out of the petro dollar because they</text>
  <text start="213.519" dur="5.58">realize what&amp;#39;s happening I mean this is</text>
  <text start="215.59" dur="6.239">the first time in 20 years that OPEC</text>
  <text start="219.099" dur="5.61">nations will be sucking liquidity out of</text>
  <text start="221.829" dur="7.321">the market rather than adding to it</text>
  <text start="224.709" dur="7.62">through investments I mean we can see</text>
  <text start="229.15" dur="6.269">what&amp;#39;s happening at this point this is a</text>
  <text start="232.329" dur="7.951">slow slide which is accelerating now</text>
  <text start="235.419" dur="9.091">into a major major collapse Australia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.28" dur="8.25">largest investment bank mcqueary just</text>
  <text start="244.51" dur="7.649">made the case that yeah QE is coming</text>
  <text start="248.53" dur="6.179">there&amp;#39;s a very high probability that</text>
  <text start="252.159" dur="6.36">it&amp;#39;s going to happen in the next 12 to</text>
  <text start="254.709" dur="6.18">18 months and we know that the Fed is</text>
  <text start="258.519" dur="4.321">going to have to do this because when we</text>
  <text start="260.889" dur="3.631">look at real information not the</text>
  <text start="262.84" dur="3.78">statistical crap that the government</text>
  <text start="264.52" dur="8.179">continually throws at us but the real</text>
  <text start="266.62" dur="9.45">hard economic data we see that</text>
  <text start="272.699" dur="7.631">everything is contracting at this point</text>
  <text start="276.07" dur="8.909">and the Fed the US government they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="280.33" dur="6.69">cornered I mean the Fed came out and</text>
  <text start="284.979" dur="4.741">they were trying to tell us oh when</text>
  <text start="287.02" dur="5.07">interest when unemployment comes down to</text>
  <text start="289.72" dur="5.22">six percent looks like we&amp;#39;ll be ready</text>
  <text start="292.09" dur="4.53">when it comes down to 5.8 will be ready</text>
  <text start="294.94" dur="3.21">and they said there&amp;#39;s so many times I</text>
  <text start="296.62" dur="5.67">think was 55 times already</text>
  <text start="298.15" dur="8">they said this you know so we are seeing</text>
  <text start="302.29" dur="7.74">that the Fed is never ever going to</text>
  <text start="306.15" dur="5.32">raise interest rates now if they do this</text>
  <text start="310.03" dur="4.5">is a signal that they&amp;#39;re getting ready</text>
  <text start="311.47" dur="5.48">to do something to bring this whole</text>
  <text start="314.53" dur="4.5">system down remember the central bankers</text>
  <text start="316.95" dur="3.76">they would rather bring it down</text>
  <text start="319.03" dur="3.72">themselves because they can control it</text>
  <text start="320.71" dur="4.95">they can blame someone else if there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="322.75" dur="4.47">black swan or something else occurs they</text>
  <text start="325.66" dur="3.75">have no control over and everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="327.22" dur="4.47">going to point their finger at them but</text>
  <text start="329.41" dur="5.79">one of the reasons as we know is that</text>
  <text start="331.69" dur="4.95">the bonds would completely implode if</text>
  <text start="335.2" dur="7.62">they start rating raising interest rates</text>
  <text start="336.64" dur="9">and this crisis will be spreading in the</text>
  <text start="342.82" dur="4.56">coming months currently right now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="345.64" dur="5.4">focused on countries that cannot print</text>
  <text start="347.38" dur="4.62">or create their own currencies the</text>
  <text start="351.04" dur="3.93">countries that are in Europe</text>
  <text start="352" dur="5.97">particularly Greece however China and</text>
  <text start="354.97" dur="5.13">Japan are also showing signs of trouble</text>
  <text start="357.97" dur="4.11">and ultimately the bond crisis will be</text>
  <text start="360.1" dur="3.63">coming to the US and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="362.08" dur="6.09">financial experts out there saying yes</text>
  <text start="363.73" dur="6.21">bonds are in a bubble well we know there</text>
  <text start="368.17" dur="6.03">are a lot of things in a bubble stocks</text>
  <text start="369.94" dur="7.44">bonds housing automobile loans student</text>
  <text start="374.2" dur="5.1">loans derivative market these are all</text>
  <text start="377.38" dur="5.1">bubbles that have been blown up by the</text>
  <text start="379.3" dur="6.21">central bank&amp;#39;s the bombuh the bomb</text>
  <text start="382.48" dur="6.69">bubble is now well over 100 trillion</text>
  <text start="385.51" dur="5.55">dollars in size and if we were to</text>
  <text start="389.17" dur="4.2">include like credit instruments that</text>
  <text start="391.06" dur="6.03">trade based on bonds it&amp;#39;s over six</text>
  <text start="393.37" dur="8.57">hundred trillion globally the sovereign</text>
  <text start="397.09" dur="8.72">bond market is 58 trillion in size so</text>
  <text start="401.94" dur="7.45">with all this in mind the bond bubble</text>
  <text start="405.81" dur="7.75">really has already begun to burst and</text>
  <text start="409.39" dur="7.55">the fuse was lit it was Greece that lit</text>
  <text start="413.56" dur="6.63">the fuse and the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="416.94" dur="5.77">understands us they know it this is why</text>
  <text start="420.19" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re using terms like a moratorium on</text>
  <text start="422.71" dur="3.72">payments they don&amp;#39;t want to say default</text>
  <text start="424.87" dur="5.55">they don&amp;#39;t want to say anything like</text>
  <text start="426.43" dur="5.61">that but this system right now cannot be</text>
  <text start="430.42" dur="3.62">sustained they know this</text>
  <text start="432.04" dur="8.07">this is why we see an acceleration</text>
  <text start="434.04" dur="9.31">everywhere for war for taking the</text>
  <text start="440.11" dur="6.18">weapons away from the people bringing in</text>
  <text start="443.35" dur="5.22">more wealth to the elite allowing</text>
  <text start="446.29" dur="4.38">corporations to get away with a lot more</text>
  <text start="448.57" dur="6.12">things like they ever have gotten away</text>
  <text start="450.67" dur="7.44">with and you can see they&amp;#39;re chipping</text>
  <text start="454.69" dur="5.16">away or really trying to remove the</text>
  <text start="458.11" dur="4.2">rights of the people because they</text>
  <text start="459.85" dur="5.9">realize that they have a certain period</text>
  <text start="462.31" dur="7.38">of time here because the system is</text>
  <text start="465.75" dur="6.61">really imploding on itself and just from</text>
  <text start="469.69" dur="4.77">the petro dollar system you can see we</text>
  <text start="472.36" dur="3.87">were at the height I mean it was five</text>
  <text start="474.46" dur="4.68">hundred billion dollars we&amp;#39;re at like</text>
  <text start="476.23" dur="7.77">zero now they&amp;#39;re getting rid of their</text>
  <text start="479.14" dur="7.32">reserves dumping Treasuries I mean that</text>
  <text start="484" dur="6.09">the Fed just can&amp;#39;t hold all the</text>
  <text start="486.46" dur="6">Treasuries it makes no sense they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="490.09" dur="4.11">want the housing market they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="492.46" dur="3.39">the prices to come down because all</text>
  <text start="494.2" dur="4.17">those homes that are left on the books</text>
  <text start="495.85" dur="4.53">of the banks the banks would be</text>
  <text start="498.37" dur="3.99">completely in solvent which they already</text>
  <text start="500.38" dur="4.32">are but everyone would see it now and</text>
  <text start="502.36" dur="5.1">the housing market would just crash so</text>
  <text start="504.7" dur="7.14">all these things that they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="507.46" dur="5.82">keep up and inflated everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="511.84" dur="4.77">starting to fall apart they&amp;#39;re running</text>
  <text start="513.28" dur="5.31">out of pieces of tape and this is why we</text>
  <text start="516.61" dur="4.92">see the escalation in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="518.59" dur="6.15">the escalation in Ukraine in Africa</text>
  <text start="521.53" dur="6.39">we&amp;#39;re hearing a lot of warnings we</text>
  <text start="524.74" dur="7.41">understand that the u.s. is going to be</text>
  <text start="527.92" dur="5.97">talking to Russia but of course we think</text>
  <text start="532.15" dur="3.06">oh they&amp;#39;re going to be talking about how</text>
  <text start="533.89" dur="2.9">they&amp;#39;re going to strike the Islamic</text>
  <text start="535.21" dur="5.25">state how they&amp;#39;re going to work together</text>
  <text start="536.79" dur="7.06">well that&amp;#39;s not exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="540.46" dur="4.92">going for the United States really</text>
  <text start="543.85" dur="5.13">doesn&amp;#39;t want to have anything to do with</text>
  <text start="545.38" dur="7.05">Russia or coordinating attacks against</text>
  <text start="548.98" dur="5.93">their proxy army actually US Secretary</text>
  <text start="552.43" dur="7.41">of John State John Kerry said that</text>
  <text start="554.91" dur="6.46">President Assad he still has to go but</text>
  <text start="559.84" dur="4.8">the timing of his departure should be</text>
  <text start="561.37" dur="6.3">decided through negotiation</text>
  <text start="564.64" dur="7.2">and he&amp;#39;s going to talk to Russia about</text>
  <text start="567.67" dur="9.3">this and talk to Iran about this to use</text>
  <text start="571.84" dur="6.93">their influence to convince Assad that</text>
  <text start="576.97" dur="4.05">he needs to transition away from his</text>
  <text start="578.77" dur="4.56">government Kerry said the United States</text>
  <text start="581.02" dur="5.94">welcome Russians involvement in tackling</text>
  <text start="583.33" dur="7.17">the Islamic state but a worsening</text>
  <text start="586.96" dur="6.12">refugee crisis underscored the need to</text>
  <text start="590.5" dur="4.01">find a compromise that could also lead</text>
  <text start="593.08" dur="4.08">to a political change in the country</text>
  <text start="594.51" dur="5.02">we&amp;#39;re too busy with the refugee crisis</text>
  <text start="597.16" dur="6.87">to really talk about coordinating our</text>
  <text start="599.53" dur="9.96">efforts here so what they want from</text>
  <text start="604.03" dur="7.86">Russia Iran is to convince Assad to</text>
  <text start="609.49" dur="4.8">remove himself well the clock is ticking</text>
  <text start="611.89" dur="5.19">down and we have to remember these</text>
  <text start="614.29" dur="7.34">refugees that we see moving across</text>
  <text start="617.08" dur="10.02">Europe the majority of them aren&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="621.63" dur="9.37">Syrian and we know that turkey has been</text>
  <text start="627.1" dur="5.7">amassing refugees in their country for</text>
  <text start="631" dur="4.92">this particular reason to get the</text>
  <text start="632.8" dur="5.37">coalition Europe everyone on board about</text>
  <text start="635.92" dur="6.72">removing Assad about setting up a safe</text>
  <text start="638.17" dur="7.35">zone but as Russia continually brings in</text>
  <text start="642.64" dur="6.54">military hardware for Assad supports</text>
  <text start="645.52" dur="6.54">Assad brings in advisors to help out to</text>
  <text start="649.18" dur="5.04">go after the Islamic state the clock is</text>
  <text start="652.06" dur="5.88">definitely ticking down for the United</text>
  <text start="654.22" dur="6.06">States and Assad right now with some of</text>
  <text start="657.94" dur="5.34">the new logistical technical weapons</text>
  <text start="660.28" dur="5.79">that he&amp;#39;s getting from Russia are highly</text>
  <text start="663.28" dur="4.41">effective and very accurate these are</text>
  <text start="666.07" dur="3.66">rocket launchers that he&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="667.69" dur="4.47">air-to-ground missiles and they are</text>
  <text start="669.73" dur="5.6">taking out the Islamic state and right</text>
  <text start="672.16" dur="5.73">now Assad is moving through Syria</text>
  <text start="675.33" dur="3.91">beating the Islamic state now of course</text>
  <text start="677.89" dur="2.58">is the proxy army for the United States</text>
  <text start="679.24" dur="4.32">government central bankers and this</text>
  <text start="680.47" dur="5.07">poses a huge problem this is what they</text>
  <text start="683.56" dur="3.42">didn&amp;#39;t want to happen this is why</text>
  <text start="685.54" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;re saying Oh Russian aggression</text>
  <text start="686.98" dur="3.96">Russian aggression look Russia&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="688.78" dur="4.08">in there but there&amp;#39;s absolutely no proof</text>
  <text start="690.94" dur="4.56">whatsoever they&amp;#39;re showing satellite</text>
  <text start="692.86" dur="5.349">images of this airport with two</text>
  <text start="695.5" dur="5.589">helicopter pads which</text>
  <text start="698.209" dur="5.281">means absolutely nothing because they</text>
  <text start="701.089" dur="5.37">have a contract with Russia to build</text>
  <text start="703.49" dur="6.11">this stuff they didn&amp;#39;t show Russian</text>
  <text start="706.459" dur="6.72">forces they didn&amp;#39;t show concrete proof</text>
  <text start="709.6" dur="6.459">they showed absolutely nothing once</text>
  <text start="713.179" dur="5.22">again and if you go on google maps you</text>
  <text start="716.059" dur="4.411">can find the same airport it&amp;#39;s not like</text>
  <text start="718.399" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s something that they uncovered it</text>
  <text start="720.47" dur="4.26">was always there and actually Russia has</text>
  <text start="722.779" dur="5.61">always said yes this is what we are</text>
  <text start="724.73" dur="6.149">doing but they&amp;#39;re using this to demonize</text>
  <text start="728.389" dur="6.271">Russia because they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
