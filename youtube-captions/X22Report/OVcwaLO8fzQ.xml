  <text start="135.67" dur="4.05">United States it has to do with the</text>
  <text start="137.59" dur="5.13">globalist system and we know that</text>
  <text start="139.72" dur="5.4">Kissinger was telling Trump and he put</text>
  <text start="142.72" dur="6.18">out the word that you need to make a</text>
  <text start="145.12" dur="6.24">deal with China very soon we know that</text>
  <text start="148.9" dur="6.36">the IMF was out there saying there has</text>
  <text start="151.36" dur="7.26">to be a deal with China very worried</text>
  <text start="155.26" dur="6.11">about Trump making a deal with China now</text>
  <text start="158.62" dur="3.94">of course what they are saying is that</text>
  <text start="161.37" dur="4.01">the</text>
  <text start="162.56" dur="5.039">higher global system the economic system</text>
  <text start="165.38" dur="3.56">is slowing because of tariffs and</text>
  <text start="167.599" dur="3.72">because of the trade war with China</text>
  <text start="168.94" dur="5.26">that&amp;#39;s not why the global economic</text>
  <text start="171.319" dur="5.64">system is slowing the global economic</text>
  <text start="174.2" dur="6.2">system is slowing because the Fiat</text>

  <text start="180.4" dur="8.05">the debt load the austerity it cannot</text>
  <text start="185.48" dur="4.86">continue on the way it is think about</text>
  <text start="188.45" dur="4.649">what they&amp;#39;ve done to keep it running</text>
  <text start="190.34" dur="5.58">they lowered interest rates to zero or</text>
  <text start="193.099" dur="6.271">negative they have stimulus going right</text>
  <text start="195.92" dur="6.24">now they can&amp;#39;t stop this and now with</text>
  <text start="199.37" dur="5.28">Trump putting pressure on China they</text>
  <text start="202.16" dur="5.97">can&amp;#39;t funnel the funds from the u.s.</text>
  <text start="204.65" dur="6.559">into China China into Europe to keep the</text>
  <text start="208.13" dur="7.32">system going because remember they</text>
  <text start="211.209" dur="7.051">created China to be a manufacturing</text>
  <text start="215.45" dur="5.94">powerhouse to shift everything away</text>
  <text start="218.26" dur="6.75">after the entire economic system</text>
  <text start="221.39" dur="7.05">collapsed and it would be after a war</text>
  <text start="225.01" dur="5.979">now they don&amp;#39;t have that and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="228.44" dur="4.799">like what Trump is doing they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="230.989" dur="4.321">there&amp;#39;s that there&amp;#39;s tariffs they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="233.239" dur="4.171">like that Trump is messing with their</text>
  <text start="235.31" dur="5.85">system they are completely exposed the</text>
  <text start="237.41" dur="6.389">curtain is pulled back they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="241.16" dur="6.919">this and now it looks like they might</text>
  <text start="243.799" dur="9.06">have sent someone to China to try to</text>
  <text start="248.079" dur="8.621">create some type of trade deal with the</text>
  <text start="252.859" dur="5.97">US to move this along we&amp;#39;ll be talking</text>
  <text start="256.7" dur="5.43">about that in just a minute but first</text>
  <text start="258.829" dur="8.4">let&amp;#39;s head out to the UK because right</text>
  <text start="262.13" dur="7.77">now Boris Johnson he is making a lot of</text>
  <text start="267.229" dur="5.461">economic moves he plans to introduce a</text>
  <text start="269.9" dur="5.76">50% discount in business rates for</text>
  <text start="272.69" dur="5.16">Britain small retailers to boost the</text>
  <text start="275.66" dur="5.069">country&amp;#39;s struggling high streets and</text>
  <text start="277.85" dur="6.87">pledged a fundamental review of the</text>
  <text start="280.729" dur="7.861">whole system in the future he&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="284.72" dur="8.04">looking to push the brexit legislation</text>
  <text start="288.59" dur="5.85">and we need to remember the UK is</text>
  <text start="292.76" dur="3.209">scheduled to leave the European Union on</text>
  <text start="294.44" dur="6.389">January 31st</text>
  <text start="295.969" dur="8.04">20:20 we know under article 50 of the</text>
  <text start="300.829" dur="5.82">European Constitution there was always</text>
  <text start="304.009" dur="6.09">going to be a transition period set to</text>
  <text start="306.649" dur="6.15">end in December of 2020 the EU is going</text>
  <text start="310.099" dur="4.47">to use this time period to try to get</text>
  <text start="312.799" dur="4.95">whatever they possibly can out of this</text>
  <text start="314.569" dur="7.08">deal and hopefully reverse everything</text>
  <text start="317.749" dur="6.12">before the brexit actually happens they</text>
  <text start="321.649" dur="5.7">have this time period</text>
  <text start="323.869" dur="7.02">now with Boris Johnson he might be</text>
  <text start="327.349" dur="7.17">pushing legislation that could end up or</text>
  <text start="330.889" dur="5.57">could lead to a No Deal brexit we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="334.519" dur="4.65">have to see how this plays out</text>
  <text start="336.459" dur="4.92">but you can see he&amp;#39;s not going to give</text>
  <text start="339.169" dur="7.89">he has the majority he won the election</text>
  <text start="341.379" dur="8.44">the people have spoken and remember the</text>
  <text start="347.059" dur="5.43">referendum question asked of the British</text>
  <text start="349.819" dur="6.24">people in 2016 yes that was three years</text>
  <text start="352.489" dur="6.42">ago was this should the United Kingdom</text>
  <text start="356.059" dur="5.13">remain a member of the European Union or</text>
  <text start="358.909" dur="3.9">leave the European Union there was no</text>
  <text start="361.189" dur="5.48">mention of deals or ongoing</text>
  <text start="362.809" dur="7.59">relationships with the UK and the EU</text>
  <text start="366.669" dur="6.28">when the people voted all the horror</text>
  <text start="370.399" dur="4.62">stories and everything the central</text>
  <text start="372.949" dur="4.53">bankers have been pushing out there the</text>
  <text start="375.019" dur="6.45">people still voted and now they voted</text>
  <text start="377.479" dur="6.39">twice is the government listening they</text>
  <text start="381.469" dur="4.141">haven&amp;#39;t for three years now we have an</text>
  <text start="383.869" dur="6.09">individual who says he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="385.61" dur="8.729">deliver brexit it&amp;#39;s time and the people</text>
  <text start="389.959" dur="8.37">voted knowing that there could be empty</text>
  <text start="394.339" dur="7.14">shelves no medicine no fuel but they</text>
  <text start="398.329" dur="7.95">still voted to separate themselves from</text>
  <text start="401.479" dur="9.66">the EU why would they do this because</text>
  <text start="406.279" dur="8.88">they knew the central bank the EU was</text>
  <text start="411.139" dur="6.81">using fear to force them the other way</text>
  <text start="415.159" dur="6.36">they know that this is not going to</text>
  <text start="417.949" dur="6.78">happen now will it happen maybe for the</text>
  <text start="421.519" dur="6.27">first week maybe two weeks maybe but</text>
  <text start="424.729" dur="4.821">they know in the end that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="427.789" dur="4.661">to be better off</text>
  <text start="429.55" dur="6.99">and if there is interim trade deals</text>
  <text start="432.45" dur="6.7">while the brexit is happening they might</text>
  <text start="436.54" dur="6.51">not see any empty shelves they might not</text>
  <text start="439.15" dur="6.51">see anything and they&amp;#39;re willing to take</text>
  <text start="443.05" dur="4.98">this chance and most of the time the</text>
  <text start="445.66" dur="6.72">central bank uses fear to convince</text>
  <text start="448.03" dur="6.93">people of not doing what they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="452.38" dur="6.24">them to do but the people now for three</text>
  <text start="454.96" dur="6.42">years have held steady and said we want</text>
  <text start="458.62" dur="5.31">a brexit now very interestingly Boris</text>
  <text start="461.38" dur="5.01">Johnson he has called for an urgent</text>
  <text start="463.93" dur="5.37">electoral commission probe into George</text>
  <text start="466.39" dur="5.52">Soros American open society foundation</text>
  <text start="469.3" dur="6.98">after putting money towards a campaign</text>
  <text start="471.91" dur="7.05">to block brexit at the ballot box and</text>
  <text start="476.28" dur="5.17">he&amp;#39;s looking into George Soros his</text>
  <text start="478.96" dur="5.7">actions and we know that George Soros he</text>
  <text start="481.45" dur="5.61">pushes his agenda around the world it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="484.66" dur="5.07">not the agenda of the people it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="487.06" dur="6.3">agenda of the elite and he&amp;#39;s using the</text>
  <text start="489.73" dur="6.63">elites money now very interestingly here</text>
  <text start="493.36" dur="4.71">in the United States it looks like Trump</text>
  <text start="496.36" dur="6.06">is moving forward with the Phase one</text>
  <text start="498.07" dur="6.63">deal we see Fang who is a spokesman of</text>
  <text start="502.42" dur="4.89">the Chinese commerce ministry said that</text>
  <text start="504.7" dur="6.87">the China and the US have been in touch</text>
  <text start="507.31" dur="6.6">about the signing of the phase 1 deal so</text>
  <text start="511.57" dur="4.95">everything that Trump has been working</text>
  <text start="513.91" dur="6.27">towards it seems like it is working out</text>
  <text start="516.52" dur="7.5">or also have gotten some more good news</text>
  <text start="520.18" dur="8.55">and this has to do with the u.s. MCA now</text>
  <text start="524.02" dur="7.62">the timing is absolutely amazing they</text>
  <text start="528.73" dur="5.52">just had the impeachment vote and then</text>
  <text start="531.64" dur="7.86">all of a sudden the House approves the</text>
  <text start="534.25" dur="7.23">US MCA 385 241 the measure now goes to</text>
  <text start="539.5" dur="4.17">the Senate the Senate Majority Leader</text>
  <text start="541.48" dur="4.53">Mitch McConnell said he didn&amp;#39;t expect to</text>
  <text start="543.67" dur="5.1">consider the u.s. MCA until a Senate</text>
  <text start="546.01" dur="4.95">trial was complete but now that said we</text>
  <text start="548.77" dur="5.46">don&amp;#39;t expect the US MCA to come up in</text>
  <text start="550.96" dur="5.34">the Senate until January right on</text>
  <text start="554.23" dur="3.69">schedule</text>
  <text start="556.3" dur="3.029">we&amp;#39;ll be talking a little bit more about</text>
  <text start="557.92" dur="4.649">the impeachment everything in the next</text>
  <text start="559.329" dur="8.1">report but it&amp;#39;s interesting that after</text>
  <text start="562.569" dur="8.43">the impeachment she saved the US MCA for</text>
  <text start="567.429" dur="5.791">that exact moment so it looks like wow</text>
  <text start="570.999" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re doing a great job in Congress</text>
  <text start="573.22" dur="5.909">it&amp;#39;s not going to work people know</text>
  <text start="576.189" dur="5.76">what&amp;#39;s going on they know what Congress</text>
  <text start="579.129" dur="6.031">has done and I&amp;#39;m not saying the entire</text>
  <text start="581.949" dur="7.5">Congress certain individuals within the</text>
  <text start="585.16" dur="8.669">house now we know that Trump the</text>
  <text start="589.449" dur="5.851">Patriots they are not a big fan of the</text>
  <text start="593.829" dur="4.711">central bank actually Trump has been</text>
  <text start="595.3" dur="5.839">tweeting out against the Fed for</text>
  <text start="598.54" dur="6.359">something like a year and a half now and</text>
  <text start="601.139" dur="6.971">we know that Trump continually tells the</text>
  <text start="604.899" dur="5.91">Fed what he wants done couple months</text>
  <text start="608.11" dur="5.19">later all of a sudden the Fed follows</text>
  <text start="610.809" dur="5.31">along we know that Trump had a meeting</text>
  <text start="613.3" dur="4.829">with Powell we understand the mainstream</text>
  <text start="616.119" dur="3.51">media is out there telling us that the</text>
  <text start="618.129" dur="3.27">Fed is done there are certain</text>
  <text start="619.629" dur="3.361">individuals within the Fed and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="621.399" dur="4.05">good guys in the Fed and bad guys in the</text>
  <text start="622.99" dur="7.86">Fed saying there is no more interest</text>
  <text start="625.449" dur="8.64">rate cuts now we know from December of</text>
  <text start="630.85" dur="6.209">2018 back then they were telling us and</text>
  <text start="634.089" dur="4.62">this was coming from the Fed that and</text>
  <text start="637.059" dur="3.541">the mainstream media that they were</text>
  <text start="638.709" dur="4.581">going to raise rates you know four or</text>
  <text start="640.6" dur="4.199">five times during the year of 2019 and</text>
  <text start="643.29" dur="5.109">what happened</text>
  <text start="644.799" dur="5.941">well they didn&amp;#39;t raise them they froze</text>
  <text start="648.399" dur="5.011">the interest rate and then they started</text>
  <text start="650.74" dur="6.809">to lower them now they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="653.41" dur="5.58">us believe that they&amp;#39;re done but we have</text>
  <text start="657.549" dur="4.23">to remember Trump called them out and</text>
  <text start="658.99" dur="5.639">said listen we need rates cut it&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="661.779" dur="6.211">to do it this is the perfect time I do</text>
  <text start="664.629" dur="6.95">believe the Patriots are going to drive</text>
  <text start="667.99" dur="7.319">the central bank system into the dirt</text>
  <text start="671.579" dur="6.43">Trump is on track for a deficit of over</text>
  <text start="675.309" dur="4.5">1 trillion in this fiscal year the</text>
  <text start="678.009" dur="4.62">federal government has only run deficits</text>
  <text start="679.809" dur="5.851">over a trillion four times all during</text>
  <text start="682.629" dur="4.231">the Great Recession but that was</text>
  <text start="685.66" dur="2.46">different because they thought they were</text>
  <text start="686.86" dur="1.75">going to cover this whole thing up with</text>
  <text start="688.12" dur="3.839">a</text>
  <text start="688.61" dur="7.409">or Trump has the central bank system</text>
  <text start="691.959" dur="11.981">exposed right now and he&amp;#39;s using those</text>
  <text start="696.019" dur="10.741">funds to build America up again this is</text>
  <text start="703.94" dur="7.74">all part of the plan everything has</text>
  <text start="706.76" dur="8.12">changed but the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="711.68" dur="6.99">don&amp;#39;t want their system coming down</text>
  <text start="714.88" dur="5.38">without an event without something to</text>

  <text start="741.56" dur="6.63">trillions not billions trillions that</text>
  <text start="745.76" dur="4.949">control the system they leave those</text>
  <text start="748.19" dur="4.829">people out of the picture why because</text>
  <text start="750.709" dur="4.981">they&amp;#39;re behind the scenes they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="753.019" dur="7.111">non elected leaders who control a lot of</text>
  <text start="755.69" dur="7.139">the countries but very interestingly NBC</text>
  <text start="760.13" dur="6.51">put out this story that Kissinger back</text>
  <text start="762.829" dur="7.32">in November met with Xi Jinping in China</text>
  <text start="766.64" dur="5.639">and they&amp;#39;re saying in this article that</text>
  <text start="770.149" dur="5.731">details of the conversation were passed</text>
  <text start="772.279" dur="7.74">on to the president now why would</text>
  <text start="775.88" dur="5.94">Kissinger go out of his way to meet with</text>
  <text start="780.019" dur="4.141">Xi Jinping remember Kissinger was out</text>
  <text start="781.82" dur="4.74">there same thing with the IMF Christine</text>
  <text start="784.16" dur="7.02">Lagarde and the rest saying there has to</text>
  <text start="786.56" dur="7.05">be a deal made with China we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="791.18" dur="5.099">continue on like this which means their</text>
  <text start="793.61" dur="5.339">system cannot continue on Kissinger said</text>
  <text start="796.279" dur="6.661">the same thing now logically thinking</text>
  <text start="798.949" dur="6.871">why would Trump have Kissinger go to</text>
  <text start="802.94" dur="6.079">China to make his deal because this</text>
  <text start="805.82" dur="6.81">entire time he was not part of this</text>
  <text start="809.019" dur="4.811">light house er and others were part of</text>
  <text start="812.63" dur="4.47">it</text>
  <text start="813.83" dur="6.06">why did he decide to go down there and</text>
  <text start="817.1" dur="5.609">then give information to the White House</text>
  <text start="819.89" dur="6.54">is he trying to save the central bank</text>
  <text start="822.709" dur="7.111">system by pushing Trump and pushing G to</text>
  <text start="826.43" dur="7.2">make a deal it&amp;#39;s starting to seem like</text>
  <text start="829.82" dur="5.97">that and it seems like they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="833.63" dur="5.79">worried that they&amp;#39;ll that there will be</text>
  <text start="835.79" dur="5.34">no deal that Trump will continue on with</text>
  <text start="839.42" dur="3.15">what he&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t remember Trump he</text>
  <text start="841.13" dur="3.18">doesn&amp;#39;t care about the globalist he</text>
  <text start="842.57" dur="4.199">doesn&amp;#39;t care about the central bank</text>
  <text start="844.31" dur="5.01">system he doesn&amp;#39;t care if the deals made</text>
  <text start="846.769" dur="6.271">now two months from now a year from now</text>
  <text start="849.32" dur="7.019">or it never made what he&amp;#39;s doing right</text>
  <text start="853.04" dur="7.65">now is he&amp;#39;s building an economic system</text>
  <text start="856.339" dur="6.62">which is outside of the globalist system</text>
  <text start="860.69" dur="6.24">outside of the central bank system and</text>
  <text start="862.959" dur="6.31">what just passed in the house the u.s.</text>
  <text start="866.93" dur="3.33">MCA this was the piece of the puzzle</text>
  <text start="869.269" dur="4.38">that he needed</text>
  <text start="870.26" dur="7.43">this will bring manufacturing to North</text>
  <text start="873.649" dur="9.571">America well of Mexico Canada the US and</text>
  <text start="877.69" dur="8.5">soon the UK soon other countries will go</text>
  <text start="883.22" dur="4.59">through the UK we will have trade with</text>
  <text start="886.19" dur="5.58">the UK like we&amp;#39;ve never seen before</text>
  <text start="887.81" dur="7.26">which will allow the United States to go</text>
  <text start="891.77" dur="5.009">up against the globalist system to go up</text>
  <text start="895.07" dur="5.06">against the central bank system and I do</text>
  <text start="896.779" dur="8.241">believe Kissinger is trying to stop this</text>
  <text start="900.13" dur="9.07">because once this happens their system</text>
  <text start="905.02" dur="8.23">starts to implode there&amp;#39;s nothing they</text>
  <text start="909.2" dur="6.6">have to stop this it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="913.25" dur="4.41">exposed to the world and Trump then has</text>
  <text start="915.8" dur="5.7">leverage over China</text>
  <text start="917.66" dur="7.919">so the question still remains did Trump</text>
  <text start="921.5" dur="7.8">send Kissinger or do Kissinger do this</text>
  <text start="925.579" dur="8.121">on his own to try to repair the central</text>
  <text start="929.3" dur="7.91">bank system we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see</text>
  <text start="933.7" dur="6.63">but as we know Trump is now moving</text>
  <text start="937.21" dur="6.42">forward and he&amp;#39;s putting all the pieces</text>
  <text start="940.33" dur="5.72">together to go up against the globalist</text>
  <text start="943.63" dur="4.32">and the central bank system</text>
