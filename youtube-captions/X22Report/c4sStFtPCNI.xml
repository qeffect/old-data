  <text start="83.65" dur="5.009">the situation out in Greece is heating</text>
  <text start="86.02" dur="4.2">up right now not much has changed but we</text>
  <text start="88.659" dur="5.1">see a lot of propaganda going back and</text>
  <text start="90.22" dur="5.88">forth about this proposal and of course</text>
  <text start="93.759" dur="3.99">as we know Greece and the central bank</text>
  <text start="96.1" dur="5.699">they&amp;#39;re completely separate and far</text>
  <text start="97.749" dur="6.211">apart on the talking points but we see</text>
  <text start="101.799" dur="4.2">out in France the French citizens are</text>
  <text start="103.96" dur="5.28">saying you know something maybe Greece</text>
  <text start="105.999" dur="6.031">should leave the eurozone I mean last</text>
  <text start="109.24" dur="4.65">month they&amp;#39;re saying about thirty-nine</text>
  <text start="112.03" dur="3.119">percent of them were saying that Greece</text>
  <text start="113.89" dur="5.07">should leave the eurozone now it&amp;#39;s up to</text>
  <text start="115.149" dur="8.521">fifty percent and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="118.96" dur="7.109">point in time the central bankers want</text>
  <text start="123.67" dur="4.949">their money i mean we see German</text>
  <text start="126.069" dur="5.881">Chancellor Angela Merkel and Francois</text>
  <text start="128.619" dur="6.721">Hollande they&amp;#39;re saying listen there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="131.95" dur="6.45">no such thing as debt forgiveness we</text>
  <text start="135.34" dur="5.94">want all the money you have to pay the</text>
  <text start="138.4" dur="5.28">central bankers well if we go back to</text>
  <text start="141.28" dur="4.35">nineteen fifty-three Germany received</text>
  <text start="143.68" dur="5.61">some debt forgiveness at that point in</text>
  <text start="145.63" dur="5.57">time how soon everyone forgets that yeah</text>
  <text start="149.29" dur="5.07">sometimes there is debt forgiveness</text>
  <text start="151.2" dur="7.81">especially if that debt was created</text>
  <text start="154.36" dur="6.39">using fraud criminal activity that is</text>
  <text start="159.01" dur="3.509">odious debt where the people are not</text>
  <text start="160.75" dur="3.39">responsible for that and this is why</text>
  <text start="162.519" dur="3.421">Greece launched an investigation</text>
  <text start="164.14" dur="5.85">into this and they&amp;#39;re saying yes this</text>
  <text start="165.94" dur="8.34">portion of the debt is odious we do not</text>
  <text start="169.99" dur="5.7">have to pay it now there are reports</text>
  <text start="174.28" dur="2.97">coming out from the Deputy Minister of</text>
  <text start="175.69" dur="4.89">Finance saying that the safety deposit</text>
  <text start="177.25" dur="6.15">box they will be shut down you will not</text>
  <text start="180.58" dur="4.2">have access to them and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="183.4" dur="3.96">are concerned about this because they</text>
  <text start="184.78" dur="4.2">place their currency precious metals in</text>
  <text start="187.36" dur="4.08">the safety deposit boxes and we know</text>
  <text start="188.98" dur="4.38">this is not a good thing to do we know</text>
  <text start="191.44" dur="4.769">here in the United States that once the</text>
  <text start="193.36" dur="4.98">bank shut down the bank&amp;#39;s can go into</text>
  <text start="196.209" dur="4.741">the safety deposit box DHS has the</text>
  <text start="198.34" dur="4.59">ability to search and confiscate the</text>
  <text start="200.95" dur="6.09">precious metal inside the safety deposit</text>
  <text start="202.93" dur="6.42">box so I wouldn&amp;#39;t be putting currency or</text>
  <text start="207.04" dur="5.33">precious metals inside the box because</text>
  <text start="209.35" dur="8.97">you will have no access to it whatsoever</text>
  <text start="212.37" dur="7.99">and the new finance minister because as</text>
  <text start="218.32" dur="4.11">we know Vera phalke&amp;#39;s resigned and I</text>
  <text start="220.36" dur="6.36">think he&amp;#39;s a better choice to handle</text>
  <text start="222.43" dur="6.45">this but again this is up to Greece he</text>
  <text start="226.72" dur="8.12">went and proposed nothing at this point</text>
  <text start="228.88" dur="5.96">in time there is no proposal whatsoever</text>
  <text start="235.019" dur="5.071">because how can there be a proposal</text>
  <text start="238.239" dur="4.831">because anything that greets proposes is</text>
  <text start="240.09" dur="5.679">going to be completely opposite of what</text>
  <text start="243.07" dur="8.28">the central bankers want this is what</text>
  <text start="245.769" dur="9.861">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing all along now there</text>
  <text start="251.35" dur="8.759">are a couple scenarios I mean first</text>
  <text start="255.63" dur="9.25">there can be a complete and a major</text>
  <text start="260.109" dur="6.571">restructure of everything in Greece much</text>
  <text start="264.88" dur="4.68">larger than the central bankers wanted</text>
  <text start="266.68" dur="6.51">before and Greece can just bow down to</text>
  <text start="269.56" dur="5.78">it and say okay we will do it they can</text>
  <text start="273.19" dur="5.82">launch a parallel currency the drachma</text>
  <text start="275.34" dur="6.61">alongside the euro and eventually get</text>
  <text start="279.01" dur="5.1">rid of the euro or they can go bankrupt</text>
  <text start="281.95" dur="4.25">default and they can leave the eurozone</text>
  <text start="284.11" dur="4.14">of course this will trigger the</text>
  <text start="286.2" dur="3.93">derivative market of course the central</text>
  <text start="288.25" dur="6.21">bankers are saying no no this is a</text>
  <text start="290.13" dur="6.7">payment moratorium it&amp;#39;s not a default we</text>
  <text start="294.46" dur="3.06">don&amp;#39;t have to worry about this but yeah</text>
  <text start="296.83" dur="2.16">once</text>
  <text start="297.52" dur="3.48">leaves the eurozone and they go bankrupt</text>
  <text start="298.99" dur="3.929">and they decided not to pay it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="301" dur="3.87">default they can call it whatever they</text>
  <text start="302.919" dur="5.611">want whatever word they want to do but</text>
  <text start="304.87" dur="5.579">it is a default now Standard &amp;amp; Poor&amp;#39;s is</text>
  <text start="308.53" dur="3.509">out there and they predicted it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="310.449" dur="3.541">fifty percent chance that the grease is</text>
  <text start="312.039" dur="3.72">going to leave the euro they&amp;#39;ve upped</text>
  <text start="313.99" dur="3.959">that percentage a little bit saying the</text>
  <text start="315.759" dur="7.231">percentage is now growing because as</text>
  <text start="317.949" dur="8.43">time goes on this situation is getting</text>
  <text start="322.99" dur="7.079">worse and we see that yeah there could</text>
  <text start="326.379" dur="5.991">be a possible Greek exit now it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="330.069" dur="6">interesting about all this as soon as</text>
  <text start="332.37" dur="8.44">the referendum was complete who did</text>
  <text start="336.069" dur="6.44">tsipras call eating coal Merkel alone he</text>
  <text start="340.81" dur="4.289">called Putin and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="342.509" dur="7.56">they agreed upon the Turkish stream</text>
  <text start="345.099" dur="8.611">pipeline where Putin is going to pay</text>
  <text start="350.069" dur="7.121">Greece about two billion dollars it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="353.71" dur="6.75">gonna spur economic growth put people</text>
  <text start="357.19" dur="5.58">back to work he didn&amp;#39;t call Obama</text>
  <text start="360.46" dur="4.92">actually he just called Obama and what</text>
  <text start="362.77" dur="6.269">is it two days later and of course Obama</text>
  <text start="365.38" dur="6.06">is telling him listen got to come up</text>
  <text start="369.039" dur="5.85">with some type of deal here you got to</text>
  <text start="371.44" dur="8.879">stay in the eurozone because we said so</text>
  <text start="374.889" dur="7.89">and the question is is the United States</text>
  <text start="380.319" dur="6.121">government central bankers going to step</text>
  <text start="382.779" dur="7.14">in are they going to bail Greece out</text>
  <text start="386.44" dur="10.289">will they create money and bail them out</text>
  <text start="389.919" dur="10.201">or maybe tell Germany to write off some</text>
  <text start="396.729" dur="11.701">of the debt I mean we can see this this</text>
  <text start="400.12" dur="9.81">could be a possibility and or can grease</text>
  <text start="408.43" dur="5.97">say you know something we&amp;#39;re defaulting</text>
  <text start="409.93" dur="9.84">and we&amp;#39;re going to take a handout from</text>
  <text start="414.4" dur="6.96">Russia to help us out here I mean any of</text>
  <text start="419.77" dur="8.569">these scenarios are possible at this</text>
  <text start="421.36" dur="8.74">point in time and the Greek minister</text>
  <text start="428.339" dur="4.191">warns</text>
  <text start="430.1" dur="4.82">at the banks might not open on wednesday</text>
  <text start="432.53" dur="4.62">they might be closed the entire week</text>
  <text start="434.92" dur="4.2">which is not good because he says the</text>
  <text start="437.15" dur="9.09">banks need to be open for the country to</text>
  <text start="439.12" dur="11.17">operate but as the situation is getting</text>
  <text start="446.24" dur="7.53">kind of worse or it&amp;#39;s stagnant nothing&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="450.29" dur="4.86">really happening he says there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="453.77" dur="6.93">reason to believe that the banks will</text>
  <text start="455.15" dur="11.46">open anytime soon I mean the central</text>
  <text start="460.7" dur="7.44">bankers want their money period this is</text>
  <text start="466.61" dur="6.06">what they&amp;#39;ve been trying to get all</text>
  <text start="468.14" dur="6.33">along they want the country in debt they</text>
  <text start="472.67" dur="3.93">want their interest payment on the money</text>
  <text start="474.47" dur="5.37">they want to capture the natural</text>
  <text start="476.6" dur="7.26">resources of the country and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="479.84" dur="6.6">going to let up whatsoever I mean the US</text>
  <text start="483.86" dur="5.61">president called German Chancellor and</text>
  <text start="486.44" dur="7.14">told Merkel to get a durable deal done</text>
  <text start="489.47" dur="6.54">ASAP more importantly was Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="493.58" dur="4.56">insistent to support the IMF sticking</text>
  <text start="496.01" dur="4.68">point namely to achieve debt</text>
  <text start="498.14" dur="5.28">sustainability which of course is</text>
  <text start="500.69" dur="5.4">ludicrous but it means that both Lagarde</text>
  <text start="503.42" dur="6.99">and Obama are now pressuring Germany to</text>
  <text start="506.09" dur="8.34">haircut Greek debt will the u.s. central</text>
  <text start="510.41" dur="6.03">bankers step in they might they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="514.43" dur="6.109">stepped in in many different cases</text>
  <text start="516.44" dur="7.11">before they&amp;#39;ve never stopped stepping in</text>
  <text start="520.539" dur="4.991">because they want to control what</text>
  <text start="523.55" dur="4.86">happens when this system comes tumbling</text>
  <text start="525.53" dur="6.93">down they want to be in control of it if</text>
  <text start="528.41" dur="5.7">it comes crumbling down right now who is</text>
  <text start="532.46" dur="3.33">to blame and you have to remember the</text>
  <text start="534.11" dur="3.51">central bank was a very were very word</text>
  <text start="535.79" dur="3.42">they don&amp;#39;t want grease leave the</text>
  <text start="537.62" dur="4.17">eurozone because if they leave the</text>
  <text start="539.21" dur="6.84">eurozone and they pivot to Russia or to</text>
  <text start="541.79" dur="8.55">the brick system and economic growth</text>
  <text start="546.05" dur="7.62">occurs in Greece and GDP gets better</text>
  <text start="550.34" dur="5.64">people get employed they start paying</text>
  <text start="553.67" dur="3.21">off their debt other countries are going</text>
  <text start="555.98" dur="3.51">to look at this and say wait a minute</text>
  <text start="556.88" dur="5.58">they can do this without the central</text>
  <text start="559.49" dur="3.94">bank actually they&amp;#39;re doing better than</text>
  <text start="562.46" dur="4.87">what we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="563.43" dur="6.99">as we accept more debt they wrote off</text>
  <text start="567.33" dur="5.1">the debt they defaulted and now there</text>
  <text start="570.42" dur="6">are economies growing this is what</text>
  <text start="572.43" dur="6.36">happened in Iceland and this is the</text>
  <text start="576.42" dur="4.56">central bankers biggest worry because if</text>
  <text start="578.79" dur="4.32">they if the countries around the world</text>
  <text start="580.98" dur="5.34">see they can survive without the central</text>
  <text start="583.11" dur="5.34">bank they&amp;#39;re all going to follow and</text>
  <text start="586.32" dur="3.269">this is the worst case scenario for them</text>
  <text start="588.45" dur="3.15">it&amp;#39;s the best case scenario for the</text>
  <text start="589.589" dur="5.971">people worst case scenario for the</text>
  <text start="591.6" dur="7.17">central bankers now the brick system</text>
  <text start="595.56" dur="5.04">they are saying that the brick bank</text>
  <text start="598.77" dur="5.4">could finance projects in other</text>
  <text start="600.6" dur="7.41">countries including Greece and the</text>
  <text start="604.17" dur="5.88">Russian finance deputy finance minister</text>
  <text start="608.01" dur="5.88">is out there saying listen there is</text>
  <text start="610.05" dur="7.789">absolutely no reason why Greece can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="613.89" dur="6.53">receive financing from the brick system</text>
  <text start="617.839" dur="6.481">so what are we seeing here right now</text>
  <text start="620.42" dur="8.85">we&amp;#39;re seeing that Greece is in limbo</text>
  <text start="624.32" dur="9.09">they&amp;#39;re buying some time still there</text>
  <text start="629.27" dur="10.12">looking to get the best deal possible</text>
  <text start="633.41" dur="8.799">and there they want to see how far the</text>
  <text start="639.39" dur="4.889">central banking system will go to</text>
  <text start="642.209" dur="5.581">accommodate what they want because they</text>
  <text start="644.279" dur="6.421">know at this point in time the people do</text>
  <text start="647.79" dur="3.9">not accept the central banking deal so</text>
  <text start="650.7" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch this</text>
  <text start="651.69" dur="4.589">situation as it unfolds we&amp;#39;ll keep</text>
  <text start="654.36" dur="6.21">looking at the indicators to see which</text>
  <text start="656.279" dur="6.271">way Greece is going to pivot and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="660.57" dur="4.11">just have to follow it now out in China</text>
  <text start="662.55" dur="5.039">we see the stock market out there has</text>
  <text start="664.68" dur="5.63">come tumbling down they&amp;#39;ve lost about</text>
  <text start="667.589" dur="6.781">twenty five percent since mid-june and</text>
  <text start="670.31" dur="6.49">the Bank of China the People&amp;#39;s Bank of</text>
  <text start="674.37" dur="4.709">China has injected about eight point two</text>
  <text start="676.8" dur="3.93">billion into the money market on Tuesday</text>
  <text start="679.079" dur="4.26">trying to prop up the entire system</text>
  <text start="680.73" dur="3.9">maybe they should have the plunge</text>
  <text start="683.339" dur="4.231">protection and the high-frequency</text>
  <text start="684.63" dur="4.59">trading that we have here in the United</text>
  <text start="687.57" dur="5.03">States because every time the market</text>
  <text start="689.22" dur="6.059">goes down all they do is turn those on</text>
  <text start="692.6" dur="3.79">overdrive and it keeps the market</text>
  <text start="695.279" dur="3.571">propped up</text>
  <text start="696.39" dur="3.93">I mean it&amp;#39;s very simple to do and maybe</text>
  <text start="698.85" dur="3.72">every country should do it but again</text>
  <text start="700.32" dur="6.27">this means the market is completely</text>
  <text start="702.57" dur="5.7">controlled it&amp;#39;s not real and at this</text>
  <text start="706.59" dur="4.02">point in time we&amp;#39;re going to have to see</text>
  <text start="708.27" dur="4.14">and watch what is going on in China</text>
  <text start="710.61" dur="4.23">because this could also have a ripple</text>
  <text start="712.41" dur="5.55">effect across the world and we can see</text>
  <text start="714.84" dur="5.01">when we look around the world we see so</text>
  <text start="717.96" dur="5.07">many different situations that the</text>
  <text start="719.85" dur="4.44">economies of the world are completely</text>
  <text start="723.03" dur="3.9">falling apart because each one of these</text>
  <text start="724.29" dur="5.25">countries is dependent on each one each</text>
  <text start="726.93" dur="6.21">each other and if one falls the other</text>
  <text start="729.54" dur="5.67">falls just like in 2008 this spread to</text>
  <text start="733.14" dur="5.49">other countries now every country was</text>
  <text start="735.21" dur="6.33">not hit the same way but the crisis did</text>

  <text start="1000.44" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s time to say okay we need to bring</text>

  <text start="1030.8" dur="6.659">with so many different type of programs</text>
  <text start="1033.77" dur="7.26">look at Obamacare for instance they they</text>

  <text start="1041.03" dur="4.65">Act they&amp;#39;re telling people that it is</text>
  <text start="1043.37" dur="6.03">good for you but it&amp;#39;s intertwined with</text>

  <text start="1049.4" dur="3.6">insurance companies and brings in</text>
  <text start="1051.29" dur="5.16">revenue to the government it does not</text>
  <text start="1053" dur="6.81">help the people whatsoever Obama so far</text>
  <text start="1056.45" dur="6.78">has spent billions of dollars on this</text>
  <text start="1059.81" dur="6.12">the website didn&amp;#39;t work they hired</text>
  <text start="1063.23" dur="6.18">friends it was a complete disaster but</text>
  <text start="1065.93" dur="4.92">they paid them billions of dollars they</text>
  <text start="1069.41" dur="3.96">called it the Affordable Care Act</text>
  <text start="1070.85" dur="4.26">Congress was not even allowed to see it</text>
  <text start="1073.37" dur="5.37">that people had no idea what they were</text>
  <text start="1075.11" dur="5.43">getting Obama promised you can keep your</text>
  <text start="1078.74" dur="5.04">doctor you can keep your insurance</text>
  <text start="1080.54" dur="6.54">policy and all of it turned out to be a</text>
  <text start="1083.78" dur="5.49">lie and they named it the Affordable</text>
  <text start="1087.08" dur="3.84">Care Act and guess what it is not</text>
  <text start="1089.27" dur="5.16">affordable whatsoever and I said this</text>
  <text start="1090.92" dur="6.45">before when the insurance company writes</text>
  <text start="1094.43" dur="6.93">the bill and they all come to</text>
  <text start="1097.37" dur="5.85">gather and say ah if we force everyone</text>
  <text start="1101.36" dur="4.44">into it we make it mandatory there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1103.22" dur="6.75">more competition we can make the prices</text>

  <text start="1115.4" dur="4.59">insurance company of course they use all</text>
  <text start="1117.41" dur="4.5">these different excuses oh we&amp;#39;re hurting</text>
  <text start="1119.99" dur="5.069">we didn&amp;#39;t realize it was going to be</text>

  <text start="1125.059" dur="6.481">created the bill and you knew you are</text>
  <text start="1127.76" dur="5.13">going to raise the premiums so the</text>
  <text start="1131.54" dur="2.91">Affordable Care Act is no longer</text>
  <text start="1132.89" dur="3.03">affordable because what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>

  <text start="1604.669" dur="5.97">is completely evident when we look</text>

  <text start="1648.35" dur="3.24">and try to take that back and this is</text>
  <text start="1650.51" dur="3.63">why we&amp;#39;ve been seeing all the propaganda</text>
  <text start="1651.59" dur="5.01">about Russian troops how they&amp;#39;re massing</text>
  <text start="1654.14" dur="5.21">tanks and other equipment and of course</text>
  <text start="1656.6" dur="4.74">this is not true they have no proof and</text>
  <text start="1659.35" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re going to continue with the</text>
  <text start="1661.34" dur="7.23">propaganda until they get the war</text>
  <text start="1665.29" dur="4.93">started now it looks like the chief of</text>

  <text start="1678.7" dur="6.01">they&amp;#39;re talking about what is happening</text>
  <text start="1682.04" dur="7.11">in Ukraine so we can see already at this</text>
  <text start="1684.71" dur="8.28">point in time that something is getting</text>
  <text start="1689.15" dur="6.54">ready to go hot now the thing is how are</text>
  <text start="1692.99" dur="4.71">they going to push this forward most</text>
  <text start="1695.69" dur="5.97">likely it will be with some type of</text>
  <text start="1697.7" dur="6">event now we see that ashton carter met</text>
  <text start="1701.66" dur="5.61">with poltrack for the first time during</text>
  <text start="1703.7" dur="7.19">the NATO defence meetings in Brussels</text>

  <text start="1720.11" dur="7.56">definitely need more troops in this area</text>

  <text start="1727.67" dur="7.2">ukrainian forces and Ashton Carter</text>
  <text start="1731.39" dur="6.3">saying yeah I think we will continue to</text>
  <text start="1734.87" dur="5.58">add more and more troops to this area</text>
  <text start="1737.69" dur="4.68">help out with the training because we</text>
  <text start="1740.45" dur="4.68">know why this is all occurring at this</text>
  <text start="1742.37" dur="4.65">point in time now France is definitely</text>
  <text start="1745.13" dur="5.28">not going to deliver the Mistral</text>
  <text start="1747.02" dur="6.36">warships to Russia and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1750.41" dur="5.04">owe money they have to refund Russia</text>
  <text start="1753.38" dur="5.82">Russia looks like they&amp;#39;re going to build</text>
  <text start="1755.45" dur="5.79">their own ships and France under</text>
  <text start="1759.2" dur="4.83">pressure of the United States government</text>
  <text start="1761.24" dur="3.9">central bankers is definitely not going</text>
  <text start="1764.03" dur="3.15">to</text>
  <text start="1765.14" dur="7.37">deliver these ships whatsoever so that</text>
  <text start="1767.18" dur="7.95">whole thing has completely died Russia</text>
  <text start="1772.51" dur="5.38">most likely now will try to get their</text>
  <text start="1775.13" dur="5.31">money back if they can now the p5 plus</text>
  <text start="1777.89" dur="5.1">one talks are continuing but it looks</text>
  <text start="1780.44" dur="7.32">like both sides can&amp;#39;t come to any type</text>
  <text start="1782.99" dur="6.12">of agreement and the agreement seems to</text>
  <text start="1787.76" dur="5.82">be out of reach right now and it looks</text>
  <text start="1789.11" dur="8.07">like they are extending the deadline to</text>
  <text start="1793.58" dur="8.22">July tenth maybe to the 13th now and we</text>
  <text start="1797.18" dur="6.75">see both sides are still having a</text>
  <text start="1801.8" dur="7.19">problem agreeing and you have to</text>
  <text start="1803.93" dur="9.8">remember this whole agreement is not</text>
  <text start="1808.99" dur="9.31">being done because of nuclear weapons I</text>
  <text start="1813.73" dur="7.6">mean for 30 years now they continually</text>
  <text start="1818.3" dur="5.43">said that Iran is building and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1821.33" dur="6.05">going to use a nuclear weapon they sign</text>
  <text start="1823.73" dur="8.07">the NPT agreement they have IAEA</text>
  <text start="1827.38" dur="7.71">inspections they never found any traces</text>
  <text start="1831.8" dur="6.54">of any type of nuclear weapon whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1835.09" dur="7.6">but we have to remember what the entire</text>
  <text start="1838.34" dur="7.17">goal was for all of this time they want</text>
  <text start="1842.69" dur="7.17">to get into Iran they would love to have</text>
  <text start="1845.51" dur="6.33">a regime change because it would make it</text>
  <text start="1849.86" dur="3.93">easier for the US government central</text>
  <text start="1851.84" dur="3.84">bankers Israel and other countries to</text>
  <text start="1853.79" dur="5.18">control the country once this occurs</text>
  <text start="1855.68" dur="6.2">just like Iraq Lebanon Libya Yemen</text>
  <text start="1858.97" dur="5.59">Ukraine which is not going too well and</text>
  <text start="1861.88" dur="4.84">their goal has always been the same to</text>
  <text start="1864.56" dur="4.44">get into this country place their</text>
  <text start="1866.72" dur="5.13">natural resources on the US dollar and</text>
  <text start="1869" dur="5.37">set up a central bank and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1871.85" dur="4.86">to continue to do this now I&amp;#39;m sure a</text>
  <text start="1874.37" dur="5.7">lot of these talks a lot of the things</text>
  <text start="1876.71" dur="6.54">that are not discussed are being kept a</text>
  <text start="1880.07" dur="6.54">secret under lock and key like the terms</text>
  <text start="1883.25" dur="4.62">of the central bank how are other</text>
  <text start="1886.61" dur="4.38">countries going to pay for their oil</text>
  <text start="1887.87" dur="5.61">when they do business with Iran the only</text>
  <text start="1890.99" dur="6.03">things are letting out is because it is</text>
  <text start="1893.48" dur="4.38">the nuclear weapon part of it because</text>
  <text start="1897.02" dur="2.94">this is whatever</text>
  <text start="1897.86" dur="5.66">one is concerned about but when we look</text>
  <text start="1899.96" dur="8.7">at the situation here we can see that if</text>
  <text start="1903.52" dur="7.48">these talks go south they will make</text>
  <text start="1908.66" dur="5.1">their move and go into Iran no matter</text>
  <text start="1911" dur="6.84">what just like they&amp;#39;re doing with Syria</text>
  <text start="1913.76" dur="6.09">and we see in all these different areas</text>
  <text start="1917.84" dur="4.89">in all these middle west middle east</text>
  <text start="1919.85" dur="5.52">countries we see the same situation</text>
  <text start="1922.73" dur="4.829">occurring the puppet governments were</text>
  <text start="1925.37" dur="4.559">put into place the people are rising up</text>
  <text start="1927.559" dur="4.801">the United States government is losing</text>
  <text start="1929.929" dur="4.62">control and they&amp;#39;re going to do whatever</text>
  <text start="1932.36" dur="4.65">they possibly can to take control of</text>
  <text start="1934.549" dur="4.891">these countries and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1937.01" dur="6.87">pushing for the authorization for war so</text>
  <text start="1939.44" dur="6.59">hard we see the proxy army for the</text>
  <text start="1943.88" dur="7.289">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="1946.03" dur="10.889">continually is creating chaos in each of</text>
  <text start="1951.169" dur="8.88">these countries and they are continually</text>
  <text start="1956.919" dur="5.621">doing this so the United States</text>
  <text start="1960.049" dur="6.421">government can go into each and every</text>
  <text start="1962.54" dur="6.509">one of these countries right now they</text>
  <text start="1966.47" dur="7.07">are preparing to set up safe zones</text>
  <text start="1969.049" dur="7.831">buffer zones in Syria because they know</text>
  <text start="1973.54" dur="7.84">they&amp;#39;re going to mount an offensive in</text>
  <text start="1976.88" dur="8.03">this country and we see Obama out there</text>

  <text start="1984.91" dur="8.2">drawn-out war we cannot defeat our own</text>
  <text start="1988.91" dur="8.07">proxy army in Syria I mean think about</text>
  <text start="1993.11" dur="6.51">what he just said here and this will go</text>
  <text start="1996.98" dur="5.1">on for a long time unless we can get</text>
  <text start="1999.62" dur="4.98">troops in Syrian i love the corporate</text>

  <text start="2016.75" dur="5.1">explain that so right now yeah he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2020.08" dur="3.24">really sending the troops that are</text>
  <text start="2021.85" dur="3.24">really neat and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
