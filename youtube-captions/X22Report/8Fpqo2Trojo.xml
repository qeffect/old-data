  <text start="126.329" dur="5.101">the global economic growth is slowing</text>
  <text start="128.75" dur="5.38">what they&amp;#39;re really saying is that their</text>
  <text start="131.43" dur="6.6">system is imploding on itself and</text>
  <text start="134.13" dur="7.23">there&amp;#39;s no way to stop it the only way</text>
  <text start="138.03" dur="4.92">to stop it is to push stimulus but that</text>
  <text start="141.36" dur="3.3">will only stop it for a certain period</text>
  <text start="142.95" dur="4.22">of time and they know this they know</text>
  <text start="144.66" dur="4.799">they can&amp;#39;t push stimulus for that long</text>
  <text start="147.17" dur="5.23">this is why the Christine Lagarde from</text>

  <text start="165.51" dur="6.75">this was done so Trump could get</text>
  <text start="169.29" dur="5.16">reelected in 2020 because the deep state</text>
  <text start="172.26" dur="5.369">the central bankers their plan was to</text>
  <text start="174.45" dur="5.94">bring down the system right before the</text>
  <text start="177.629" dur="5.25">elections and Q has warned us about this</text>
  <text start="180.39" dur="6.09">and told us that this was their plan</text>
  <text start="182.879" dur="5.161">now throw out all these warnings and Q</text>
  <text start="186.48" dur="3.69">coming out and telling us that the feds</text>
  <text start="188.04" dur="5.309">gonna be restructured that gold is going</text>
  <text start="190.17" dur="6.959">to destroy the Fed there&amp;#39;s a message in</text>
  <text start="193.349" dur="5.161">there for every single person and if you</text>
  <text start="197.129" dur="3.72">were listening and if you were paying</text>
  <text start="198.51" dur="4.71">attention you would understand what that</text>
  <text start="200.849" dur="3.42">was and we&amp;#39;ll be talking about that in</text>
  <text start="203.22" dur="3.96">just a minute I think is a very</text>
  <text start="204.269" dur="5.461">important message but the pattern that</text>
  <text start="207.18" dur="5.76">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about where housing</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="5.28">is falling apart it is continuing not</text>
  <text start="212.94" dur="5.37">just here in the u.s. yesterday we</text>
  <text start="215.01" dur="6.599">talked about Australia well if we look</text>
  <text start="218.31" dur="6.78">at Canada right now everything has just</text>
  <text start="221.609" dur="6.21">gotten a little bit worse when we look</text>
  <text start="225.09" dur="5.91">at Vancouver right now their home sales</text>
  <text start="227.819" dur="6.48">they crash by 46% this is the lowest</text>
  <text start="231" dur="6.63">since 1985 now according to the real</text>
  <text start="234.299" dur="5.671">estate board of Greater Vancouver total</text>
  <text start="237.63" dur="5.009">housing sales were forty six point three</text>
  <text start="239.97" dur="5.97">percent below the ten-year March sales</text>
  <text start="242.639" dur="8.341">average and was the lowest total for the</text>
  <text start="245.94" dur="8.31">month since 1985 86 so that&amp;#39;s not good</text>
  <text start="250.98" dur="5.129">and when we look at Australia and we</text>
  <text start="254.25" dur="5.359">look at Canada when we look at the u.s.</text>
  <text start="256.109" dur="5.551">we can see that the housing market is</text>
  <text start="259.609" dur="5.53">buckling under the pressure</text>
  <text start="261.66" dur="6.81">remember the central banks pumped these</text>
  <text start="265.139" dur="4.921">bumbles up they pumped them up to make</text>
  <text start="268.47" dur="4.23">the economy look great and they knew</text>
  <text start="270.06" dur="4.079">that these bubbles were going to pop but</text>
  <text start="272.7" dur="3.18">they didn&amp;#39;t care because they were going</text>
  <text start="274.139" dur="3.691">to use an event they were going to blame</text>
  <text start="275.88" dur="4.86">this on something else but right now</text>
  <text start="277.83" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re exposed they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="280.74" dur="7.109">exposed and they don&amp;#39;t know what to do</text>
  <text start="283.8" dur="6.63">about it this is their biggest fear this</text>
  <text start="287.849" dur="4.681">is their biggest worry and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="290.43" dur="4.62">trying to figure out a way on how to get</text>
  <text start="292.53" dur="5.46">around this but who controls the</text>
  <text start="295.05" dur="4.049">narrative Trump the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="297.99" dur="3.989">control</text>
  <text start="299.099" dur="6.181">the entire system right now and the</text>
  <text start="301.979" dur="5.041">central bankers all they can do is maybe</text>
  <text start="305.28" dur="3.479">try to blame it on him blame it on the</text>
  <text start="307.02" dur="2.989">tariffs but once the deal goes through</text>
  <text start="308.759" dur="4.68">with China</text>
  <text start="310.009" dur="5.97">what ammunition do they have left what</text>
  <text start="313.439" dur="6.301">can they use against Trump</text>
  <text start="315.979" dur="8.171">nothing once Trump makes this deal with</text>
  <text start="319.74" dur="8.37">China and he has until what the election</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="6.299">period 2020 I mean he can wait until</text>
  <text start="328.11" dur="4.799">this whole year is gone I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="330.449" dur="5.551">he&amp;#39;s going to I think he&amp;#39;s gonna make</text>
  <text start="332.909" dur="6.54">the deal and then hold on to the tariffs</text>
  <text start="336" dur="5.58">until 2020 and then start removing the</text>
  <text start="339.449" dur="4.74">tariffs just to make sure that China</text>
  <text start="341.58" dur="7.23">complies plus who will remove the</text>
  <text start="344.189" dur="6.84">tariffs before the 2020 election which</text>
  <text start="348.81" dur="5.849">will mean the central bankers will have</text>
  <text start="351.029" dur="7.95">no ammunition whatsoever there are no</text>
  <text start="354.659" dur="7.32">tariffs his trade deal with China has</text>
  <text start="358.979" dur="6.921">been set the economy statistical numbers</text>
  <text start="361.979" dur="7.59">are fantastic why in the world would the</text>
  <text start="365.9" dur="6.009">economic system be slowing who&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="369.569" dur="5.611">blame we know who&amp;#39;s to blame it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="371.909" dur="6.18">central bank but as we move forward we</text>
  <text start="375.18" dur="5.549">can see that the people&amp;#39;s system the</text>
  <text start="378.089" dur="5.82">actual nuts and bolts of the economic</text>
  <text start="380.729" dur="5.521">system they&amp;#39;re falling apart US factory</text>
  <text start="383.909" dur="5.1">orders they&amp;#39;ve been flat too weak for</text>
  <text start="386.25" dur="4.74">six straight months in a row in February</text>
  <text start="389.009" dur="4.801">factory orders fell point five percent</text>
  <text start="390.99" dur="5.31">month and month and now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="393.81" dur="5.729">seeing is factory orders and the US</text>
  <text start="396.3" dur="4.769">equity market they&amp;#39;re decoupling they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="399.539" dur="5.69">going in opposite directions and this</text>
  <text start="401.069" dur="6.75">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense at all but once again</text>
  <text start="405.229" dur="5.86">there are statistical numbers there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="407.819" dur="4.981">the stock market and then there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="411.089" dur="4.621">real economy the people&amp;#39;s economy where</text>
  <text start="412.8" dur="5.07">you can touch and feel it these are two</text>
  <text start="415.71" dur="4.35">separate things and you can see that</text>
  <text start="417.87" dur="4.59">these statistical numbers they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="420.06" dur="4.74">in one direction the people&amp;#39;s economy is</text>
  <text start="422.46" dur="3.69">going in a different direction and we</text>
  <text start="424.8" dur="4.76">know eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="426.15" dur="6.43">is that the system will implode and</text>
  <text start="429.56" dur="7.06">again Trump the Patriots to prepare</text>
  <text start="432.58" dur="6.39">to transition us out of this system and</text>
  <text start="436.62" dur="5.32">just I think it was yesterday</text>
  <text start="438.97" dur="5.04">there was a report that Saudi Arabia was</text>
  <text start="441.94" dur="4.59">threatening to dump the petrodollar if</text>
  <text start="444.01" dur="5.43">the u.s. went ahead with the no Peck</text>
  <text start="446.53" dur="5.13">legislation today Saudi Arabia is out</text>
  <text start="449.44" dur="4.38">there saying we said no such thing the</text>
  <text start="451.66" dur="4.8">reports are inaccurate we are not doing</text>
  <text start="453.82" dur="5.19">this they&amp;#39;ve said this before but once</text>
  <text start="456.46" dur="4.74">again we know they&amp;#39;ve been cozying up to</text>
  <text start="459.01" dur="6.69">Russia we know they&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="461.2" dur="6.9">the Petro yuyuan and they know that this</text>
  <text start="465.7" dur="3.63">system is not going to last forever and</text>
  <text start="468.1" dur="2.85">eventually what they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="469.33" dur="3.27">do is they&amp;#39;re gonna have to get out of</text>
  <text start="470.95" dur="4.11">the petro dollar system remember the</text>
  <text start="472.6" dur="3.69">petro dollar system this is a central</text>
  <text start="475.06" dur="3.51">bank system which was created back in</text>
  <text start="476.29" dur="5.25">1971 when we were taken off the gold</text>
  <text start="478.57" dur="5.73">standard so the rest of the world they</text>
  <text start="481.54" dur="4.89">starting to realize that the reserve</text>
  <text start="484.3" dur="6.14">currency of the world it&amp;#39;s coming to an</text>
  <text start="486.43" dur="7.11">end now queue has been giving us</text>
  <text start="490.44" dur="5.53">information about how this is gonna go</text>
  <text start="493.54" dur="4.98">down how the Fed is going to be</text>
  <text start="495.97" dur="4.86">destroyed that restructured and q has</text>
  <text start="498.52" dur="4.89">been talking about gold and and asked</text>
  <text start="500.83" dur="6.63">you know do we have the gold and q said</text>
  <text start="503.41" dur="6.18">yes and gold will destroy the Fed now if</text>
  <text start="507.46" dur="5.28">you were listening to what Q actually</text>
  <text start="509.59" dur="7.14">said here is that gold is very very</text>
  <text start="512.74" dur="7.74">important why is it important it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="516.73" dur="7.74">important because gold is the kryptonite</text>
  <text start="520.48" dur="6.41">to the central bank&amp;#39;s fiat system which</text>
  <text start="524.47" dur="6.69">means that every single person should</text>
  <text start="526.89" dur="9.16">have some type of precious metal either</text>
  <text start="531.16" dur="6.63">it be gold or silver now I think when Q</text>
  <text start="536.05" dur="5.04">came out and said that gold is going to</text>
  <text start="537.79" dur="7.41">destroy the Fed I do believe that every</text>
  <text start="541.09" dur="6.9">single person should also have gold or</text>
  <text start="545.2" dur="5.64">silver because if Q is telling us that</text>
  <text start="547.99" dur="6.21">the Patriots are going to use gold to</text>
  <text start="550.84" dur="7.35">destroy the Fiat system the central bank</text>
  <text start="554.2" dur="7.11">system shouldn&amp;#39;t we all be prepared with</text>
  <text start="558.19" dur="6.78">gold this is actually like a hidden</text>
  <text start="561.31" dur="6.21">message within this that</text>
  <text start="564.97" dur="6.11">the Fiat system is going to come to an</text>
  <text start="567.52" dur="6.24">end the Fed is going to be restructured</text>
  <text start="571.08" dur="6.1">shouldn&amp;#39;t everyone protect themselves</text>
  <text start="573.76" dur="5.73">with some form of precious metals I mean</text>
  <text start="577.18" dur="4.47">if you can&amp;#39;t afford gold remember you</text>
  <text start="579.49" dur="4.71">don&amp;#39;t have to buy an ounce of gold you</text>
  <text start="581.65" dur="5.64">can buy 1/8 of gold you can buy 1/4 of</text>
  <text start="584.2" dur="4.92">gold you can also purchase silver and I</text>
  <text start="587.29" dur="4.8">don&amp;#39;t like to use the word purchase you</text>
  <text start="589.12" dur="7.38">should trade your Fiat paper money in</text>
  <text start="592.09" dur="7.02">for sound money and use this as your</text>
  <text start="596.5" dur="7.14">insurance policy for when the Fiat</text>
  <text start="599.11" dur="7.17">system goes south so when you really</text>
  <text start="603.64" dur="6.02">think about it if they&amp;#39;re going to bring</text>
  <text start="606.28" dur="8.07">down the central bank system with gold</text>
  <text start="609.66" dur="8.02">every single person in the US should be</text>
  <text start="614.35" dur="5.39">holding some form of precious metal to</text>
  <text start="617.68" dur="4.02">protect themselves</text>
  <text start="619.74" dur="5.56">now I&amp;#39;m sure they are gonna have</text>
  <text start="621.7" dur="5.76">safeguards within this transition I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="625.3" dur="5.04">sure they&amp;#39;re gonna do their best but</text>
  <text start="627.46" dur="6.57">remember we should never depend on the</text>
  <text start="630.34" dur="7.14">government to protect ourselves our</text>
  <text start="634.03" dur="5.04">wealth or anything like that that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="637.48" dur="3.96">what the Founding Fathers actually</text>
  <text start="639.07" dur="5.1">wanted the founding fathers wanted</text>
  <text start="641.44" dur="4.38">everyone to be independent they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="644.17" dur="3.24">want you to be dependent on a government</text>
  <text start="645.82" dur="5.37">that&amp;#39;s why they called it the executive</text>
  <text start="647.41" dur="6.42">branch they were an executive and they</text>
  <text start="651.19" dur="5.79">were supposed to follow orders from the</text>
  <text start="653.83" dur="6.08">states and handle other certain tasks</text>
  <text start="656.98" dur="5.82">but they weren&amp;#39;t supposed to have</text>
  <text start="659.91" dur="4.8">control over the people and make the</text>
  <text start="662.8" dur="5.31">people dependent on the government</text>
  <text start="664.71" dur="6.22">that&amp;#39;s not how this was planned out I</text>
  <text start="668.11" dur="5.729">mean over time the nieve state the</text>
