  <text start="109.5" dur="4.32">see that the central bankers they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="111.69" dur="4.65">happy with this because this was part of</text>
  <text start="113.82" dur="5.579">their plan to rebalance everything</text>
  <text start="116.34" dur="5.97">basically shape the entire world into</text>
  <text start="119.399" dur="6.06">their one world government one currency</text>
  <text start="122.31" dur="5.19">type of world one type of control and in</text>
  <text start="125.459" dur="3.931">order to do this you needed to bring</text>
  <text start="127.5" dur="3.45">countries up to a certain level the</text>
  <text start="129.39" dur="5.1">United States down to a certain level</text>
  <text start="130.95" dur="6.63">and basically distribute the wealth this</text>
  <text start="134.49" dur="5.16">is what this was all about and many</text>
  <text start="137.58" dur="3.45">people are out there saying well how can</text>
  <text start="139.65" dur="3.66">he do this the earth is going to be</text>
  <text start="141.03" dur="4.86">destroyed and we discussed how many</text>
  <text start="143.31" dur="5.61">times they said that the earth was going</text>
  <text start="145.89" dur="5.76">to have no snow that land was going to</text>
  <text start="148.92" dur="5.73">be under water the ice cap is going to</text>
  <text start="151.65" dur="5.25">be melting and they did since the 70s</text>
  <text start="154.65" dur="3.63">over and over and over because basically</text>
  <text start="156.9" dur="3.96">that weather they were doing is they</text>
  <text start="158.28" dur="5.46">were preparing the United States for</text>
  <text start="160.86" dur="5.61">this this is really in the endgame this</text>
  <text start="163.74" dur="5.969">is what they really wanted now very</text>
  <text start="166.47" dur="7.11">interestingly john coleman he is the</text>
  <text start="169.709" dur="7.561">founder of The Weather Channel and he</text>
  <text start="173.58" dur="7.71">tweeted out and he started to speak out</text>
  <text start="177.27" dur="6.81">about global warming and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="181.29" dur="5.64">seeing is he&amp;#39;s saying that this is a</text>
  <text start="184.08" dur="5.549">complete hoax when he look</text>
  <text start="186.93" dur="4.22">at the raw data and he looked at</text>
  <text start="189.629" dur="5.791">temperatures going back to the 70s</text>
  <text start="191.15" dur="7.03">there&amp;#39;s absolutely no sign of global</text>
  <text start="195.42" dur="4.739">warming whatsoever he said there&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="198.18" dur="6.99">less than 1 degree temperature change</text>
  <text start="200.159" dur="8.461">since in 1978 and no warming to speak of</text>
  <text start="205.17" dur="5.22">since 1998 so where is the government</text>
  <text start="208.62" dur="4.17">getting their information from he says</text>
  <text start="210.39" dur="4.59">it turns out that the government has</text>
  <text start="212.79" dur="5.1">been manipulating climate computer</text>
  <text start="214.98" dur="4.89">models and we&amp;#39;ve heard about this before</text>
  <text start="217.89" dur="3.78">where they take the raw temperature and</text>
  <text start="219.87" dur="3.33">they have these computer models to let</text>
  <text start="221.67" dur="4.709">us know what the temperatures are going</text>
  <text start="223.2" dur="5.459">to be so basically what this really</text>
  <text start="226.379" dur="4.08">means is that the American taxpayer are</text>
  <text start="228.659" dur="3.841">being charged four point seven billion a</text>
  <text start="230.459" dur="4.261">year in taxes that are being used to</text>
  <text start="232.5" dur="4.59">fund organizations that carry out</text>
  <text start="234.72" dur="4.799">meaningless studies based on bad signs</text>
  <text start="237.09" dur="5.25">so basically the American people paying</text>
  <text start="239.519" dur="5.58">for fake signs and he has this video out</text>
  <text start="242.34" dur="5.88">there and he&amp;#39;s explaining how the earth</text>
  <text start="245.099" dur="6.811">is not really warming we&amp;#39;re actually in</text>
  <text start="248.22" dur="5.82">a phase of cooling at this time but that</text>
  <text start="251.91" dur="7.189">didn&amp;#39;t stop all these individuals who</text>
  <text start="254.04" dur="8.099">want the globalist vision we see Mayor</text>
  <text start="259.099" dur="5.201">Bill DeBlasio he signed an executive</text>
  <text start="262.139" dur="4.831">order reaffirming the city&amp;#39;s commitment</text>
  <text start="264.3" dur="5.79">to the Paris climate change agreement we</text>
  <text start="266.97" dur="5.4">see Bloomberg is out there and he is the</text>
  <text start="270.09" dur="5.22">same exact individual that told us that</text>
  <text start="272.37" dur="5.22">we can&amp;#39;t drink 2-liter cokes he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="275.31" dur="4.65">to outlaw those and you won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="277.59" dur="4.44">purchase 2-liter cokes you could only</text>
  <text start="279.96" dur="4.35">purchase a lot of 1 liter bottles and</text>
  <text start="282.03" dur="4.109">this was going to help each and every</text>
  <text start="284.31" dur="4.2">single person which really doesn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="286.139" dur="6.15">anything he was also the individual that</text>
  <text start="288.51" dur="6.24">was trying to ban weapons and try to get</text>
  <text start="292.289" dur="3.75">all the states on board to this program</text>
  <text start="294.75" dur="3.449">well that kind of kind of fizzled</text>
  <text start="296.039" dur="5.13">completely out that didn&amp;#39;t work at all</text>
  <text start="298.199" dur="4.911">now he&amp;#39;s on board trying to get all the</text>
  <text start="301.169" dur="5.28">different states to come together and</text>
  <text start="303.11" dur="6.52">join in on the coalition of states to</text>
  <text start="306.449" dur="5.641">combat climate change and of course he</text>
  <text start="309.63" dur="5.969">has New York he has Washington and</text>
  <text start="312.09" dur="6.9">California and there&amp;#39;s one problem with</text>
  <text start="315.599" dur="5.071">this first of all the bankers don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="318.99" dur="4.05">if you&amp;#39;re on board</text>
  <text start="320.67" dur="4.16">with the climate Accord and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="323.04" dur="4.41">trying to make the world a better place</text>
  <text start="324.83" dur="6.28">the problem with what he&amp;#39;s trying to do</text>
  <text start="327.45" dur="7.14">is they can&amp;#39;t give the bankers the money</text>
  <text start="331.11" dur="4.8">they want they want billions of dollars</text>
  <text start="334.59" dur="3.27">from the United States that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="335.91" dur="4.2">what it came down to and that was</text>
  <text start="337.86" dur="4.26">supposed to go into the green fund which</text>
  <text start="340.11" dur="5.52">was going to be redistributed amongst</text>
  <text start="342.12" dur="5.43">the emerging markets those countries or</text>
  <text start="345.63" dur="4.08">third world countries to bring them up</text>
  <text start="347.55" dur="4.02">to a certain level while the United</text>
  <text start="349.71" dur="4.2">States has being brought down to a</text>
  <text start="351.57" dur="3.99">certain level and if you really look at</text>
  <text start="353.91" dur="6.18">it you can see that like Russia China</text>
  <text start="355.56" dur="6.27">and India the countries that really have</text>
  <text start="360.09" dur="2.43">the most pollution going into the</text>
  <text start="361.83" dur="3.66">atmosphere</text>
  <text start="362.52" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;ve given absolutely no money to</text>
  <text start="365.49" dur="4.5">this fund only the United States has</text>
  <text start="367.86" dur="3.84">given the funds so what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="369.99" dur="3.75">interesting about this they&amp;#39;re all out</text>
  <text start="371.7" dur="4.22">there saying oh you know we have to</text>
  <text start="373.74" dur="5.13">protect the earth this is about</text>
  <text start="375.92" dur="7.17">corporations this is about central banks</text>
  <text start="378.87" dur="7.32">this is about taking the funds and</text>
  <text start="383.09" dur="5.68">changing the world molding the world</text>
  <text start="386.19" dur="5.22">into what they wanted now this went</text>
  <text start="388.77" dur="6.75">along with the TPP and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="391.41" dur="7.65">right now is that their entire plan what</text>
  <text start="395.52" dur="5.52">they wanted it&amp;#39;s falling apart and all</text>
  <text start="399.06" dur="4.2">these states it&amp;#39;s meaningless because</text>
  <text start="401.04" dur="3.42">they don&amp;#39;t have any money to give so you</text>
  <text start="403.26" dur="2.52">know what that bankers are going to do</text>
  <text start="404.46" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re just going to look the other way</text>
  <text start="405.78" dur="4.44">because who cares we don&amp;#39;t care if</text>
  <text start="407.73" dur="4.86">you&amp;#39;re your you&amp;#39;re keeping your state</text>
  <text start="410.22" dur="6.03">and abiding by the emission rules that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="412.59" dur="7.35">not what we wanted we wanted the funds</text>
  <text start="416.25" dur="6.81">we wanted the ability to change the</text>
  <text start="419.94" dur="4.92">world into what we wanted we wanted the</text>
  <text start="423.06" dur="4.53">United States to be a third world nation</text>
  <text start="424.86" dur="5.13">we needed to make everyone even on an</text>
  <text start="427.59" dur="4.77">even playing field that was the whole</text>
  <text start="429.99" dur="4.68">purpose to this but that whole thing&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="432.36" dur="4.32">falling apart so what do they do now I</text>
  <text start="434.67" dur="4.29">mean Putin said this was a framework</text>
  <text start="436.68" dur="4.38">document where things can be negotiated</text>
  <text start="438.96" dur="3.12">within the document and the central</text>
  <text start="441.06" dur="4.26">bankers are saying there is no</text>
  <text start="442.08" dur="5.73">negotiation whatsoever so it looks like</text>
  <text start="445.32" dur="5.31">and we&amp;#39;ll probably see them do this</text>
  <text start="447.81" dur="6.3">they&amp;#39;re going to probably think of taxes</text>
  <text start="450.63" dur="3.85">that they can place on the US one they</text>
  <text start="454.11" dur="2.44">started</text>
  <text start="454.48" dur="4.41">with the carbon tax I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="456.55" dur="4.14">other ways that they can try to figure</text>
  <text start="458.89" dur="3.54">out even though they&amp;#39;re not part of the</text>
  <text start="460.69" dur="3.45">United States is that part of this where</text>
  <text start="462.43" dur="4.14">they can say you know something the</text>
  <text start="464.14" dur="6.2">World Bank or whatever it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="466.57" dur="6.12">has to place a some type of</text>
  <text start="470.34" dur="4.27">environmental tax on the United States</text>
  <text start="472.69" dur="4.01">they might not even call a carbon tax</text>
  <text start="474.61" dur="4.26">they might call it something else where</text>
  <text start="476.7" dur="4.09">eventually they can get those funds</text>
  <text start="478.87" dur="3.96">because that&amp;#39;s what they really want</text>
  <text start="480.79" dur="3.57">they don&amp;#39;t care about the they the only</text>
  <text start="482.83" dur="3.84">reason they wanted that because they</text>
  <text start="484.36" dur="4.29">knew the the jobs were going to be lost</text>
  <text start="486.67" dur="4.11">over this but they really wanted the</text>
  <text start="488.65" dur="4.56">funds to pump into the other countries</text>
  <text start="490.78" dur="5.79">to even out the playing field so they</text>
  <text start="493.21" dur="4.44">need to get the money and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="496.57" dur="2.16">they&amp;#39;re going to be working on we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="497.65" dur="4.08">have to see what they come up with</text>
  <text start="498.73" dur="6.24">because you know in the end they they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="501.73" dur="5.76">going to try to get the money one way or</text>
  <text start="504.97" dur="3.75">another now we see right now that the</text>
  <text start="507.49" dur="3.12">Supreme Court they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="508.72" dur="4.32">expediting Trump&amp;#39;s petition on the</text>
  <text start="510.61" dur="4.59">executive order about the travel ban and</text>
  <text start="513.04" dur="3.39">it looks like they&amp;#39;re accelerating the</text>
  <text start="515.2" dur="3.51">process they&amp;#39;re going to be reviewing</text>
  <text start="516.43" dur="4.2">the Fourth Circuit Court blocking of the</text>
  <text start="518.71" dur="3.24">travel ban and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how</text>
  <text start="520.63" dur="2.43">that works out and it looks like the</text>
  <text start="521.95" dur="3.18">Supreme Court&amp;#39;s going to be looking at</text>
  <text start="523.06" dur="3.54">this we see the corporate media is all</text>
  <text start="525.13" dur="4.14">over the place saying that you know</text>
  <text start="526.6" dur="6">Trump is going to invoke his executive</text>
  <text start="529.27" dur="5.85">privilege and block Comey well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.6" dur="4.23">ridiculous because if he does that the</text>
  <text start="535.12" dur="3.87">corporate media would be all over Trump</text>
  <text start="536.83" dur="3.66">and basically why would he be blocking</text>
  <text start="538.99" dur="3.93">and that would show some type of guilt</text>
  <text start="540.49" dur="4.98">and we could see already that was all</text>
  <text start="542.92" dur="4.08">propaganda once again because the White</text>
  <text start="545.47" dur="3.18">House has come out and said no we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="547" dur="3.12">invoking any type of privilege</text>
  <text start="548.65" dur="4.71">whatsoever we&amp;#39;re not going to block</text>
  <text start="550.12" dur="6.24">Comey he can testify freely not a big</text>
  <text start="553.36" dur="5.97">deal out in the Philippines we see</text>
  <text start="556.36" dur="4.56">do-dirty he&amp;#39;s confirmed that this attack</text>
  <text start="559.33" dur="3.72">in the casino</text>
  <text start="560.92" dur="4.17">well he&amp;#39;s saying it wasn&amp;#39;t Islamic state</text>
  <text start="563.05" dur="5.64">he&amp;#39;s saying that the attack on the</text>
  <text start="565.09" dur="4.53">casino in the capital was a botched</text>
  <text start="568.69" dur="3.03">robbery</text>
  <text start="569.62" dur="4.98">the gunman he has not been identified</text>
  <text start="571.72" dur="4.95">but he&amp;#39;s sticking with that story right</text>
  <text start="574.6" dur="3.96">now and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how that plays</text>
  <text start="576.67" dur="5.25">out but he&amp;#39;s saying that this was not a</text>
  <text start="578.56" dur="6.63">terror attack now we understand the u.s.</text>
  <text start="581.92" dur="5.55">had that test firing of a missile to</text>
  <text start="585.19" dur="3.12">stop a ballistic missile and we went</text>
  <text start="587.47" dur="3.33">over it how</text>
  <text start="588.31" dur="4.35">they had all the data everything was set</text>
  <text start="590.8" dur="3.75">up perfectly everything was aligned and</text>
  <text start="592.66" dur="4.8">we said in a real life to type of</text>
  <text start="594.55" dur="5.31">situation there&amp;#39;s no way that the United</text>
  <text start="597.46" dur="3.63">States would be able to intercept a</text>
  <text start="599.86" dur="3.03">ballistic missile because they wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="601.09" dur="4.08">have all that data and we they wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="602.89" dur="5.01">have all that time to prepare for this</text>
  <text start="605.17" dur="5.43">type of an attack now coming from</text>
  <text start="607.9" dur="3.92">Christopher Ford the special assistant</text>
  <text start="610.6" dur="4.65">to the US president on</text>
  <text start="611.82" dur="5.74">counter-proliferation the u.s. does not</text>
  <text start="615.25" dur="4.26">expect that its strategic missile</text>
  <text start="617.56" dur="3.75">defense system will be able to tackle</text>
  <text start="619.51" dur="4.35">the threat posed by North Korea</text>
  <text start="621.31" dur="4.2">so they&amp;#39;re already saying that this is</text>
  <text start="623.86" dur="3.78">not going to work even though this was</text>
  <text start="625.51" dur="5.91">successful there was a lot of prep work</text>

  <text start="687.82" dur="6.69">the de-escalation zones how the killing</text>
  <text start="691.3" dur="5.039">in Syria could be stopped how the war</text>
  <text start="694.51" dur="3.6">could be stopped and the Trump</text>
  <text start="696.339" dur="5.37">administration right now the priority on</text>
  <text start="698.11" dur="7.77">Syria is to stop the war and the killing</text>
  <text start="701.709" dur="6.721">and this is why the u.s. is willing to</text>
  <text start="705.88" dur="5.64">watch what Russia is they&amp;#39;re willing to</text>
  <text start="708.43" dur="6.9">give Russia a major role to play to find</text>
  <text start="711.52" dur="4.86">a solution in Syria and the Americans</text>
  <text start="715.33" dur="3.6">and the Russians they&amp;#39;ve been meaning</text>
  <text start="716.38" dur="4.32">quietly on Syria without announcing it</text>
  <text start="718.93" dur="3.03">and they&amp;#39;ve been talking about this</text>
  <text start="720.7" dur="3.54">Tillerson</text>
  <text start="721.96" dur="5.16">asked for a short window of opportunity</text>
  <text start="724.24" dur="5.55">to change the trajectory of our</text>
  <text start="727.12" dur="4.5">relationship with Russia and basically</text>
  <text start="729.79" dur="5.34">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="731.62" dur="7.08">trying to figure out a way to appease</text>
  <text start="735.13" dur="6.36">every single side to stop the war in</text>
  <text start="738.7" dur="6.15">Syria now we know there&amp;#39;s additional</text>
  <text start="741.49" dur="5.4">peace talks coming up in mid-june and we</text>
  <text start="744.85" dur="5.19">can see that what is happening in Syria</text>
  <text start="746.89" dur="5.76">is that the deep state along with Israel</text>
  <text start="750.04" dur="4.5">along with guitar along with Saudi</text>
  <text start="752.65" dur="4.68">Arabia and the rest of the coalition</text>
  <text start="754.54" dur="5.7">forces well their time has come where</text>
  <text start="757.33" dur="6.06">they will not be allowed to stay in</text>
  <text start="760.24" dur="5.94">Syria now the reason for this is because</text>
  <text start="763.39" dur="5.43">the Islamic state well they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="766.18" dur="4.98">wiped out and pushed out of the entire</text>
  <text start="768.82" dur="5.31">country along with al-qaeda the moderate</text>
  <text start="771.16" dur="5.31">rebels even Assad is out there now and</text>
  <text start="774.13" dur="5.31">he&amp;#39;s saying that the worst of his</text>
  <text start="776.47" dur="5.46">country&amp;#39;s war has now passed he says</text>
  <text start="779.44" dur="4.2">after a series of losses for the Islamic</text>
  <text start="781.93" dur="4.08">state group and other jihadist</text>
  <text start="783.64" dur="4.17">organizations it looks like things are</text>
  <text start="786.01" dur="3.87">now moving in the right direction which</text>
  <text start="787.81" dur="4.29">is a better directions because we are</text>
  <text start="789.88" dur="4.68">defeating the terrorists and he went on</text>
  <text start="792.1" dur="6.17">to say he goes unless the West does</text>
  <text start="794.56" dur="7.05">something to help their paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="798.27" dur="5.8">maybe have some type of an event he says</text>
  <text start="801.61" dur="5.61">in a couple of months the country will</text>
  <text start="804.07" dur="5.97">be cleared of all extremists and this</text>
  <text start="807.22" dur="5.85">must have the deep state very very</text>
  <text start="810.04" dur="6.39">worried right now and we can expect if</text>
  <text start="813.07" dur="5.07">they still have the ability to do it we</text>
  <text start="816.43" dur="3.93">might see some type of an event because</text>
  <text start="818.14" dur="5.07">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is behind</text>
  <text start="820.36" dur="3.93">the scenes the Trump administration is</text>
  <text start="823.21" dur="4.02">working with Russia</text>
  <text start="824.29" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;re working with Russia to basically</text>
  <text start="827.23" dur="7.14">close the borders down to keep Syria</text>
  <text start="830.95" dur="5.84">intact to keep Assad as the leader and</text>
  <text start="834.37" dur="6.12">at the same time the deep state is</text>
  <text start="836.79" dur="6.31">making their moves trying to split Syria</text>
  <text start="840.49" dur="4.95">into two but we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="843.1" dur="4.86">deep state is losing their footing in</text>
  <text start="845.44" dur="4.98">this country and it looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="847.96" dur="6.42">getting more and more difficult to keep</text>
  <text start="850.42" dur="5.26">certain parts of the country and if all</text>
  <text start="854.38" dur="4.959">the terrorists are we</text>
  <text start="855.68" dur="5.88">moved there is no reason for France to</text>
  <text start="859.339" dur="4.231">be in there there&amp;#39;s no reason for the</text>
  <text start="861.56" dur="3.96">United States to be in there there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="863.57" dur="4.23">reason for the Germans to be in there</text>
  <text start="865.52" dur="5.28">there&amp;#39;s no reason for the UK to be in</text>
  <text start="867.8" dur="5.22">there there&amp;#39;s no reason for any of these</text>
  <text start="870.8" dur="4.65">countries to be in Syria because the</text>
  <text start="873.02" dur="5.46">whole point of it was to go after the</text>
  <text start="875.45" dur="5.88">terrorists now Russia and Syria remove</text>
  <text start="878.48" dur="5.34">all the terrorists guess what they need</text>
  <text start="881.33" dur="4.77">to remove themselves and this is what</text>
  <text start="883.82" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;ve been talking about right now now</text>
  <text start="886.1" dur="6.75">out in London we had this event occur on</text>
  <text start="890.33" dur="4.77">the London Bridge where this van</text>
  <text start="892.85" dur="4.95">reportedly plowed into pedestrians there</text>
  <text start="895.1" dur="4.44">was also a knife attack and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="897.8" dur="4.53">and there were a lot of gunfire taking</text>
  <text start="899.54" dur="6.12">place at the same time and this is</text>
  <text start="902.33" dur="5.819">another event that occurred and we had</text>
  <text start="905.66" dur="4.35">another event the Manchester bombing now</text>
  <text start="908.149" dur="4.201">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="910.01" dur="6.42">this is that this is all happening</text>
  <text start="912.35" dur="6.57">during the same exact time the brexit</text>
  <text start="916.43" dur="6.06">negotiations are occurring there are</text>
  <text start="918.92" dur="6.96">elections coming up on June 8th and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="922.49" dur="8.039">amazing how all of this is happening in</text>
  <text start="925.88" dur="6.72">this same time period because I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="930.529" dur="5.101">to tell you what&amp;#39;s going to happen once</text>
  <text start="932.6" dur="6.33">the elections are completed once the</text>
  <text start="935.63" dur="5.85">brexit is completed most likely we will</text>
  <text start="938.93" dur="5.64">not see the terrorists do this anymore</text>
  <text start="941.48" dur="6.24">now remember these are false flags these</text>
  <text start="944.57" dur="6.72">are happening for a specific to push</text>
  <text start="947.72" dur="6.989">things in a certain way to push an</text>
  <text start="951.29" dur="6.12">agenda and it just so happens it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="954.709" dur="4.741">happening at the same time that these</text>
  <text start="957.41" dur="4.679">two things are happening because think</text>
  <text start="959.45" dur="6.15">about it we haven&amp;#39;t had anything up into</text>
  <text start="962.089" dur="6.111">this point within what three weeks of</text>
  <text start="965.6" dur="6.239">all this happening and it&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="968.2" dur="5.44">exactly at this point in time so we can</text>
  <text start="971.839" dur="4.291">see there&amp;#39;s an agenda still going on</text>
  <text start="973.64" dur="4.83">still trying to scare the people still</text>
  <text start="976.13" dur="4.199">trying to implement laws and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="978.47" dur="3.39">because of what is happening in the</text>
  <text start="980.329" dur="4.591">country remember there&amp;#39;s many different</text>
  <text start="981.86" dur="6.39">agendas associated with this and we can</text>
  <text start="984.92" dur="4.74">see that these agendas are now really</text>
  <text start="988.25" dur="2.85">corresponding to</text>
  <text start="989.66" dur="3.75">the election that&amp;#39;s happening on jouer</text>
  <text start="991.1" dur="4.53">June 8th the brexit talks that are going</text>
  <text start="993.41" dur="4.8">on right now where the EU does not want</text>
  <text start="995.63" dur="4.83">the UK leaving they put all these</text>
  <text start="998.21" dur="5.22">demands on the UK they want them to pay</text>
  <text start="1000.46" dur="4.77">this enormous bill and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1003.43" dur="4.8">continually sending a message saying</text>
  <text start="1005.23" dur="5.19">listen don&amp;#39;t do it don&amp;#39;t do it because</text>
  <text start="1008.23" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;re going to keep doing this to you so</text>
  <text start="1010.42" dur="4.71">we can see what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="1011.65" dur="6.81">the deep state all of this is coming to</text>
  <text start="1015.13" dur="5.22">an end and when you back the deep state</text>
  <text start="1018.46" dur="5.46">into a corner well they have no other</text>
  <text start="1020.35" dur="6.27">place to go except forward with an event</text>
  <text start="1023.92" dur="5.669">now if they do have the ability still to</text>
  <text start="1026.62" dur="5.089">do this we will see an event but we can</text>
  <text start="1029.589" dur="5.041">see that things are coming to an end</text>
  <text start="1031.709" dur="5.291">everything is crashing around them and</text>
  <text start="1034.63" dur="5">it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder for them</text>
  <text start="1037" dur="5.61">to operate they&amp;#39;ve lost the Middle East</text>
  <text start="1039.63" dur="5.559">Syria is completely done unless they can</text>
  <text start="1042.61" dur="4.95">do something else but we can see already</text>
  <text start="1045.189" dur="5.161">from what Russia has done what Assad has</text>
  <text start="1047.56" dur="5.37">been doing with Russia and now the Trump</text>
  <text start="1050.35" dur="3.93">administration we can see that talks are</text>
  <text start="1052.93" dur="3.72">going in a completely different</text>
  <text start="1054.28" dur="4.35">direction than what the deep state wants</text>
  <text start="1056.65" dur="5.7">so we can see things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="1058.63" dur="6.39">changing and the deep state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1062.35" dur="5.1">terrified they&amp;#39;re worried they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1065.02" dur="5.46">know what to do at this point and we can</text>
  <text start="1067.45" dur="6.54">see as Trump continually pushes his</text>
  <text start="1070.48" dur="6.09">agenda prepares the United States for</text>
  <text start="1073.99" dur="4.47">this incredible transition even Putin is</text>
