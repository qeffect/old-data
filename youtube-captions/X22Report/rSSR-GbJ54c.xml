  <text start="423.569" dur="5.22">combat the Islamic state which means</text>

  <text start="435.66" dur="6.53">from a US official now the u.s. plans to</text>
  <text start="438.9" dur="5.31">launch intensified attacks in Libya and</text>
  <text start="442.19" dur="4.42">they&amp;#39;re gonna be doing this around the</text>
  <text start="444.21" dur="4.38">coastal city of cert so we saw already</text>
  <text start="446.61" dur="2.52">everything has been set up everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="448.59" dur="2.91">in place</text>
  <text start="449.13" dur="5.04">once the unity government gives them the</text>
  <text start="451.5" dur="4.32">okay we&amp;#39;re gonna see all-out war in</text>
  <text start="454.17" dur="3.3">Libya we&amp;#39;re gonna see bombing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="455.82" dur="2.97">gonna see me troops coming in because we</text>
  <text start="457.47" dur="3.42">know France has been supplying</text>
  <text start="458.79" dur="4.05">reconnaissance missions we know the UK&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.89" dur="4.53">there we know Egypt is there we know</text>
  <text start="462.84" dur="4.05">Italy&amp;#39;s there we know us is there and we</text>
  <text start="465.42" dur="5.55">can see they&amp;#39;re getting ready to take</text>
  <text start="466.89" dur="7.53">back Libya because as we know as time</text>
  <text start="470.97" dur="5.34">goes on and the people take control of</text>
  <text start="474.42" dur="4.62">their own countries they&amp;#39;re no longer</text>
  <text start="476.31" dur="4.38">going to use the private western central</text>
  <text start="479.04" dur="4.05">bank there&amp;#39;s no longer going to use the</text>
  <text start="480.69" dur="4.23">dollar when they sell the oil and this</text>
  <text start="483.09" dur="3.78">is why the US needs to go back into</text>
  <text start="484.92" dur="3.78">every single one of these countries and</text>
  <text start="486.87" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re doing it in Yemen they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="488.7" dur="3.18">it in Libya they&amp;#39;re getting ready to do</text>
  <text start="490.23" dur="4.29">it in Lebanon they&amp;#39;re already doing it</text>
  <text start="491.88" dur="5.28">in Iraq and they want other countries</text>
  <text start="494.52" dur="5.28">because we know back in 2008 their list</text>
  <text start="497.16" dur="4.71">was to get into Syria and Iran and they</text>
  <text start="499.8" dur="5.37">still have that goal because in their</text>
  <text start="501.87" dur="6.12">minds they believe if they do this the</text>
  <text start="505.17" dur="4.83">whole system will be a-okay and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="507.99" dur="3.21">be able to prop it up for a little while</text>
  <text start="510" dur="2.099">longer but the whole thing&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="511.2" dur="4.649">falling apart</text>
  <text start="512.099" dur="5.731">and we are moving into war into every</text>
  <text start="515.849" dur="4.681">one of these countries at this point now</text>
  <text start="517.83" dur="5.67">it looks like the US and Turkey they are</text>
  <text start="520.53" dur="5.1">shifting plans right now because we see</text>
  <text start="523.5" dur="5.34">hostilities are erupting on the border</text>
  <text start="525.63" dur="4.89">between Armenia and Azerbaijan both</text>
  <text start="528.84" dur="4.08">sides are accusing each other of using</text>
  <text start="530.52" dur="4.43">machine guns and mortars and the</text>
  <text start="532.92" dur="7.62">situation in the disputed</text>
  <text start="534.95" dur="9.04">nagorno-karabakh that region is becoming</text>
  <text start="540.54" dur="5.13">very very tense and we can see most</text>
  <text start="543.99" dur="3.89">likely that this was a false flag</text>
  <text start="545.67" dur="5.46">someone might have just been in there</text>
  <text start="547.88" dur="6.22">firing weapons to get both sides started</text>
  <text start="551.13" dur="7.77">here now the Turkish government they are</text>
  <text start="554.1" dur="7.17">provoking this entire region and it</text>
  <text start="558.9" dur="4.46">looks like Ankara is working to</text>
  <text start="561.27" dur="3.87">destabilize relationships between</text>
  <text start="563.36" dur="5.11">Armenia and as</text>
  <text start="565.14" dur="7.31">by John by supporting the Baku&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="568.47" dur="7.619">aggressive policies in nagano Karabakh</text>
  <text start="572.45" dur="7.69">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that this area</text>
  <text start="576.089" dur="8.401">is on the border of Turkey a borders</text>
  <text start="580.14" dur="7.879">Russia and the US wants this area now</text>
  <text start="584.49" dur="5.82">very interestingly Lavrov and John Kerry</text>
  <text start="588.019" dur="4.661">they are saying oh no we need a</text>
  <text start="590.31" dur="6.089">ceasefire in this area now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="592.68" dur="7.68">interesting is that this conflict in the</text>
  <text start="596.399" dur="6.511">nagano Karabakh began in 1988 when the</text>
  <text start="600.36" dur="5.19">Armenian dominated autonomous region</text>
  <text start="602.91" dur="5.489">sought to secede from the soviet</text>
  <text start="605.55" dur="4.68">socialist republic before proclaiming</text>
  <text start="608.399" dur="4.44">independence after the Soviet Union&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="610.23" dur="5.49">collapse in 1991 in September of 2015</text>
  <text start="612.839" dur="4.291">the conflict escalated with sides</text>
  <text start="615.72" dur="4.41">blaming each other for violating the</text>
  <text start="617.13" dur="4.8">truce and Lavrov and Kerry right now are</text>
  <text start="620.13" dur="4.35">saying listen this has to stop</text>
  <text start="621.93" dur="4.89">we need peace in the region now this has</text>
  <text start="624.48" dur="4.41">been going on for quite a while but</text>
  <text start="626.82" dur="4.29">what&amp;#39;s really interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="628.89" dur="4.559">not that Lavrov and Kerry are calling</text>
  <text start="631.11" dur="6.77">for peace is that Kerry is calling for</text>
  <text start="633.449" dur="6.811">peace because he visited this area a</text>
  <text start="637.88" dur="4.959">couple days before and then on the</text>
  <text start="640.26" dur="6.65">weekend what do we see we saw violence</text>
  <text start="642.839" dur="7.231">erupt and then Turkey steps in and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="646.91" dur="6.91">poking the flame trying to build it up</text>
  <text start="650.07" dur="6.81">now John Kerry he met with Azuri</text>
  <text start="653.82" dur="7.65">the president calling for an ultimate</text>
  <text start="656.88" dur="10.199">resolution to the conflict and then all</text>
  <text start="661.47" dur="9.78">of a sudden things started to break out</text>
  <text start="667.079" dur="8.301">in violence now we know every time a US</text>
  <text start="671.25" dur="7.56">official Victoria Nuland George Soros</text>
  <text start="675.38" dur="6.04">Joe Biden whenever they start visiting</text>
  <text start="678.81" dur="5.37">areas and we see something happen a</text>
  <text start="681.42" dur="6.15">couple days later we know this was</text>
  <text start="684.18" dur="8.37">planned and we&amp;#39;re seeing this right now</text>
  <text start="687.57" dur="8.579">and we have to remember that as Rajai</text>
  <text start="692.55" dur="6.27">Bonn and Armenia they border Iran and</text>
  <text start="696.149" dur="5.461">Turkey on the south and on north</text>
  <text start="698.82" dur="7.32">they&amp;#39;re bordering Georgia and Russia and</text>
  <text start="701.61" dur="7.17">this is a strategic location that the</text>
  <text start="706.14" dur="5.61">United States wants that NATO wants and</text>
  <text start="708.78" dur="5.85">this is an area where there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="711.75" dur="5.58">conflict and this could be a great area</text>
  <text start="714.63" dur="5.09">where they can spark a war and we can</text>
  <text start="717.33" dur="6.78">see at this point Turkey is involved</text>
  <text start="719.72" dur="8.5">they&amp;#39;re shifting their plans trying to</text>
  <text start="724.11" dur="7.14">provoke something in this area and we</text>
  <text start="728.22" dur="4.95">have to watch this entire region very</text>
  <text start="731.25" dur="5.63">very carefully because we know the u.s.</text>
  <text start="733.17" dur="6.24">wants war because the economy is</text>
  <text start="736.88" dur="4.75">accelerating it&amp;#39;s falling apart they</text>
  <text start="739.41" dur="4.02">need to cover it up military assets have</text>

  <text start="744.77" dur="6.46">there are drills going on preparing for</text>
  <text start="747.63" dur="6.48">a specific incidents in these areas and</text>
  <text start="751.23" dur="6.63">we can see at this point they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="754.11" dur="6.36">gonna stop until they get this war going</text>
  <text start="757.86" dur="5.67">now our one is out there and he made a</text>
  <text start="760.47" dur="5.79">very interesting statement about the</text>
  <text start="763.53" dur="5.99">Kurdistan Workers Party the PKK they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="766.26" dur="6.45">saying that they must surrender or be</text>
  <text start="769.52" dur="6.46">neutralized saying that the time for</text>
  <text start="772.71" dur="5.88">peace talks is over so it looks like</text>
  <text start="775.98" dur="6.36">Iran is gonna ramp whatever he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="778.59" dur="8.96">over there up tenfold and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="782.34" dur="9.51">see war break out in Turkey in Syria in</text>
  <text start="787.55" dur="6.82">Armenia in Azerbaijan and it looks like</text>
  <text start="791.85" dur="5.94">this is part of their entire plant now</text>
  <text start="794.37" dur="6.3">Iran they are bringing in commandos into</text>
  <text start="797.79" dur="5.76">Syria and you have to remember Iran and</text>
  <text start="800.67" dur="5.28">Syria they have a defense agreement</text>
  <text start="803.55" dur="4.14">between each other so when people call</text>
  <text start="805.95" dur="3.39">out like oh look around troops are</text>
  <text start="807.69" dur="5.01">inside of Syria well they have a defense</text>
  <text start="809.34" dur="5.37">agreement just like Syria and Russia</text>
  <text start="812.7" dur="4.92">they have an agreement where Assad</text>
  <text start="814.71" dur="4.53">invited Russia in now the only countries</text>
  <text start="817.62" dur="3.39">that don&amp;#39;t have an agreement with Syria</text>
  <text start="819.24" dur="4.71">to be in that country are let&amp;#39;s say the</text>
  <text start="821.01" dur="6.54">United States UK and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="823.95" dur="6.06">coalition forces so Iran has a right to</text>
  <text start="827.55" dur="4.65">be there because they&amp;#39;re invited in by</text>
  <text start="830.01" dur="2.94">Syria Russia has a right to be there</text>
  <text start="832.2" dur="5.43">because they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="832.95" dur="6.66">I didn&amp;#39;t buy Syria and at this point we</text>
  <text start="837.63" dur="4.62">can see there&amp;#39;s going to be Iranian</text>
  <text start="839.61" dur="5.7">commandos brought in and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="842.25" dur="5.73">to be advisers in Syria now most likely</text>
  <text start="845.31" dur="4.32">as time goes on as the United States</text>
  <text start="847.98" dur="4.68">government central bankers the coalition</text>
  <text start="849.63" dur="5.22">forces push war in this area these</text>
  <text start="852.66" dur="4.92">advisers just like the US advisers will</text>
  <text start="854.85" dur="4.56">turn into combat soldiers and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="857.58" dur="3.99">positioning them in the country because</text>
  <text start="859.41" dur="4.47">they realize what&amp;#39;s happening here they</text>
  <text start="861.57" dur="5.01">realize that the u.s. is not going to</text>
  <text start="863.88" dur="6.51">sit by and just get Assad let let Assad</text>
  <text start="866.58" dur="7.65">be reelected now Assad came out and he</text>
  <text start="870.39" dur="6.21">is saying the West can&amp;#39;t be trusted this</text>
  <text start="874.23" dur="6.54">is the most important lesson syria has</text>
  <text start="876.6" dur="8.22">learned during the five years and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="880.77" dur="7.8">right because the u.s. doesn&amp;#39;t follow</text>
  <text start="884.82" dur="6.06">international law they lie when they</text>
  <text start="888.57" dur="6.06">talk about things and they always do the</text>
  <text start="890.88" dur="6.54">opposite of what they&amp;#39;re saying and at</text>
  <text start="894.63" dur="5.43">this point I don&amp;#39;t think any country out</text>
  <text start="897.42" dur="4.05">there is really trusting the u.s. at</text>

  <text start="937.32" dur="4.35">a place where most I&amp;#39;d say the majority</text>
  <text start="939.6" dur="7.71">of the people don&amp;#39;t really want to go</text>
  <text start="941.67" dur="8.13">and that is war now we see that Qatar is</text>
  <text start="947.31" dur="3.9">out there along with Saudi Arabia which</text>
  <text start="949.8" dur="4.32">we know they&amp;#39;re behind a lot of the</text>
  <text start="951.21" dur="7.35">terrorists that are in Syria they train</text>
  <text start="954.12" dur="6.78">them they paid for them and they</text>

  <text start="960.9" dur="5.88">along with Turkey and the US and Israel</text>
  <text start="963.77" dur="4.93">but Qatar is warning right now</text>
  <text start="966.78" dur="4.68">that the Syrian government airstrikes</text>
  <text start="968.7" dur="7.74">that killed 30 people including children</text>
  <text start="971.46" dur="6.72">near Damascus might just rip apart the</text>
  <text start="976.44" dur="5.73">ceasefire deal now of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="978.18" dur="7.44">using this to get rid of the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="982.17" dur="5.4">deal and Saudi Arabia has accused Syria</text>
  <text start="985.62" dur="3.72">of violating the ceasefire now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="987.57" dur="4.38">gonna do whatever they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="989.34" dur="4.44">make it look like Syria doesn&amp;#39;t want</text>

  <text start="993.78" dur="2.94">back out of it</text>
  <text start="994.62" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re killing their own people while</text>
  <text start="996.72" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re pushing out the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="998.43" dur="5.64">winning back their country liberating</text>

  <text start="1007.16" dur="6.87">people it still makes no sense and it</text>
  <text start="1011.06" dur="4.77">will never make sense but they put it</text>

  <text start="1028.37" dur="4.97">done this but they don&amp;#39;t show us the</text>
  <text start="1030.74" dur="6.03">proof because they don&amp;#39;t have any they</text>
  <text start="1033.34" dur="5.44">don&amp;#39;t have the link that&amp;#39;s why they can</text>
  <text start="1036.77" dur="5.87">only show pictures of people in</text>
  <text start="1038.78" dur="6.48">hospitals people on the battlefield</text>
  <text start="1042.64" dur="3.94">because they don&amp;#39;t have that link it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1045.26" dur="3">almost like a murder case and I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="1046.58" dur="3.48">this many times where you show the dead</text>
  <text start="1048.26" dur="3.54">body and you just point anyone yeah he</text>

  <text start="1054.56" dur="4.05">link and if believe me if they had the</text>
  <text start="1056.21" dur="5.94">link it&amp;#39;d be plastered all over the</text>
  <text start="1058.61" dur="6.06">place now we can see what&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="1062.15" dur="5.88">Syria as the Islamic state is being</text>
  <text start="1064.67" dur="7.5">pushed out they&amp;#39;re replacing the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1068.03" dur="5.82">state the proxy army with the Free</text>
  <text start="1072.17" dur="3.75">Syrian Army now all they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="1073.85" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re taking the individual Islamic</text>
  <text start="1075.92" dur="3.75">state soldiers and they&amp;#39;re rebranding</text>
  <text start="1078.05" dur="2.91">them and saying look we just trained</text>
  <text start="1079.67" dur="4.17">another one we&amp;#39;re letting them in</text>
  <text start="1080.96" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re also bringing in the coalition</text>
  <text start="1083.84" dur="6.12">forces and the special forces of the</text>
  <text start="1085.7" dur="5.82">u.s. to fill the void of where the</text>
  <text start="1089.96" dur="3.48">Islamic state was and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1091.52" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re doing right now because where</text>
  <text start="1093.44" dur="4.98">they know that Russia is not going to</text>
  <text start="1095.45" dur="4.29">fire upon the coalition forces now of</text>
  <text start="1098.42" dur="2.43">course the coalition forces are not</text>
  <text start="1099.74" dur="3.66">invited into Ser</text>
  <text start="1100.85" dur="4.23">they decided to invade a country and we</text>
  <text start="1103.4" dur="3.21">know they&amp;#39;re not gonna fire upon the</text>
  <text start="1105.08" dur="4.92">Free Syrian Army because we have this</text>
  <text start="1106.61" dur="5.43">ceasefire deal going on right now so</text>
  <text start="1110" dur="4.32">every time the Islamic state is being</text>
  <text start="1112.04" dur="5.22">pushed out they&amp;#39;re trying to fill the</text>
  <text start="1114.32" dur="5.1">void with other troops and other</text>
  <text start="1117.26" dur="4.38">soldiers and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1119.42" dur="7.5">at this point now we are seeing more</text>
  <text start="1121.64" dur="9.06">Intel analysts who are looking at the</text>
  <text start="1126.92" dur="8.73">ISIS intelligence and these are soldiers</text>
  <text start="1130.7" dur="7.2">in sem calm saying that well what is</text>
  <text start="1135.65" dur="4.98">being said and what&amp;#39;s really being done</text>
  <text start="1137.9" dur="4.02">are two different things and the</text>
  <text start="1140.63" dur="3.81">analysts are saying they&amp;#39;re being forced</text>
  <text start="1141.92" dur="5.58">out for not towing the Obama</text>
  <text start="1144.44" dur="5.22">administration line on the war to senior</text>
  <text start="1147.5" dur="3.81">intelligence analysts at the US Central</text>
  <text start="1149.66" dur="3.9">Command say the military has forced them</text>
  <text start="1151.31" dur="4.86">out of their jobs because of their</text>
  <text start="1153.56" dur="6.06">skeptical reporting on us back rebel</text>
  <text start="1156.17" dur="7.26">groups in Syria and we know going back</text>
  <text start="1159.62" dur="6.18">that they were lying on the intelligence</text>
  <text start="1163.43" dur="4.05">reports saying that yes these are the</text>
  <text start="1165.8" dur="3.93">targets were being hitting the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1167.48" dur="4.2">state and the real reports showed that</text>
  <text start="1169.73" dur="3.03">no they weren&amp;#39;t hitting the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1171.68" dur="2.76">state they were hitting the</text>
  <text start="1172.76" dur="3.51">infrastructure they were going after</text>
  <text start="1174.44" dur="4.23">these Syrian armed forces they were</text>
  <text start="1176.27" dur="5.79">going after everything but the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1178.67" dur="4.86">state and we see right now there are</text>
  <text start="1182.06" dur="4.16">more and more people coming out saying</text>
  <text start="1183.53" dur="5.01">yet these are all fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="1186.22" dur="6.4">this is not what we&amp;#39;ve been hitting this</text>
  <text start="1188.54" dur="6.45">is why Obama presented the targets to</text>
  <text start="1192.62" dur="4.71">the armed forces saying these are the</text>
  <text start="1194.99" dur="5.61">targets we want you to hit this is what</text>
  <text start="1197.33" dur="5.04">our Intel is telling us and they just</text>
  <text start="1200.6" dur="3.24">went along with it and they started to</text>
  <text start="1202.37" dur="3.9">realize what wait a minute what are we</text>
  <text start="1203.84" dur="5.04">hitting here now David Cameron is out</text>
  <text start="1206.27" dur="6.09">there and he&amp;#39;s putting a warning saying</text>
  <text start="1208.88" dur="6.9">that the Islamic state is getting</text>
  <text start="1212.36" dur="6.84">nuclear material and he&amp;#39;s saying they</text>
  <text start="1215.78" dur="6.36">are definitely getting it and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1219.2" dur="6.9">telling everyone that they&amp;#39;re planning</text>
  <text start="1222.14" dur="8.19">to use drones to spray nuclear material</text>
  <text start="1226.1" dur="7.77">over Western cities and in some type of</text>
  <text start="1230.33" dur="5.07">horrific dirty bomb attack</text>
  <text start="1233.87" dur="5.19">and world leaders right now are very</text>
  <text start="1235.4" dur="7.32">concerned about this and most likely</text>
  <text start="1239.06" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more laws saying</text>
  <text start="1242.72" dur="3.15">that you cannot have a drone whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1244.37" dur="4.59">and we can see why they&amp;#39;re pushing this</text>
  <text start="1245.87" dur="6.03">because when things really start to fall</text>
  <text start="1248.96" dur="5.4">apart and the people are very angry</text>
  <text start="1251.9" dur="6.48">because they lost their jobs because</text>
  <text start="1254.36" dur="5.76">their wealth has completely disappeared</text>
  <text start="1258.38" dur="4.29">because the devaluation of the dollar</text>
  <text start="1260.12" dur="5.07">the banks are locked up the entire</text>
  <text start="1262.67" dur="4.74">system has crashed they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="1265.19" dur="4.19">looking at the government they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1267.41" dur="6.18">be looking at the central bank and</text>
  <text start="1269.38" dur="8.8">they&amp;#39;re worried about people forming</text>
  <text start="1273.59" dur="6.6">groups militias and using drones to</text>
  <text start="1278.18" dur="4.74">scout ahead for them because you can get</text>
  <text start="1280.19" dur="4.29">a top view of the area</text>
  <text start="1282.92" dur="3.99">you don&amp;#39;t need satellites or anything</text>
  <text start="1284.48" dur="3.75">like that and they&amp;#39;re very worried about</text>
  <text start="1286.91" dur="3.57">this and they don&amp;#39;t want people flying</text>
  <text start="1288.23" dur="4.29">drones so most likely what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1290.48" dur="4.05">to do is they&amp;#39;re and we see it&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="1292.52" dur="4.62">started where they want people to</text>
  <text start="1294.53" dur="5.16">register their drones now of course as</text>
  <text start="1297.14" dur="3.6">we know when things go downhill people</text>
  <text start="1299.69" dur="3.27">are not going to be worried about their</text>
  <text start="1300.74" dur="4.68">registered drones they&amp;#39;re gonna use the</text>
  <text start="1302.96" dur="6.06">drones they&amp;#39;re gonna keep them in hiding</text>
  <text start="1305.42" dur="4.92">and they can set up all these laws but I</text>
  <text start="1309.02" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s gonna work in the end</text>
  <text start="1310.34" dur="5.55">the second agenda of all of this is to</text>
  <text start="1313.34" dur="5.64">scare the public that another false flag</text>
  <text start="1315.89" dur="5.61">is coming that the Islamic state has the</text>
  <text start="1318.98" dur="5.04">ability to use nuclear type of weapons</text>
