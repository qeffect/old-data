  <text start="201.47" dur="7.26">century ago this whole system is</text>
  <text start="206.42" dur="4.05">completely falling apart it&amp;#39;s getting</text>

  <text start="221.18" dur="5.22">CenturyLink right now is planning a</text>
  <text start="223.4" dur="4.98">layoff a thousand people I mean think</text>
  <text start="226.4" dur="5.19">about all the layoffs that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="228.38" dur="5.55">seeing and of course then we have the</text>
  <text start="231.59" dur="5.07">stock market and like I always say the</text>
  <text start="233.93" dur="4.8">stock market is the last indicator that</text>
  <text start="236.66" dur="3.84">things have completely fallen apart</text>
  <text start="238.73" dur="3.869">because we&amp;#39;ve been following up and</text>
  <text start="240.5" dur="5.28">we&amp;#39;ve been watching this since the</text>
  <text start="242.599" dur="5.331">beginning and now we see real estate</text>
  <text start="245.78" dur="6.139">imploding prices starting to come down</text>

  <text start="251.919" dur="8.281">now we see the stock market having</text>
  <text start="255.44" dur="8.07">problems I mean if we look back to 2008</text>
  <text start="260.2" dur="6.31">from august first 2008 December to</text>
  <text start="263.51" dur="7.379">September first 2008 the dow fell by</text>
  <text start="266.51" dur="8.37">nearly 700 points and we all remember</text>
  <text start="270.889" dur="6">what happened after that right now we</text>
  <text start="274.88" dur="6.14">are watching something that&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="276.889" dur="9.03">identical the Dow has plummeted nearly</text>
  <text start="281.02" dur="7.78">700 points since July sixteenth and it</text>
  <text start="285.919" dur="4.921">is now down nine hundred plus points</text>
  <text start="288.8" dur="6.679">from the peak of the market back in May</text>
  <text start="290.84" dur="5.889">at this point the Dow has now fallen for</text>
  <text start="295.479" dur="5.3">six</text>
  <text start="296.729" dur="7.231">days in a row and 11 of the last 13 so</text>
  <text start="300.779" dur="4.771">what are we seeing here well of course</text>
  <text start="303.96" dur="5.039">they&amp;#39;re all telling us that everything</text>
  <text start="305.55" dur="5.579">is fine I mean if we go back to 2007</text>
  <text start="308.999" dur="3.69">market internals began to weaken</text>
  <text start="311.129" dur="3.56">dramatically talking heads and asset</text>
  <text start="312.689" dur="5.22">gatherers had fears were overblown</text>
  <text start="314.689" dur="5.38">everyone&amp;#39;s crazy Fez the Fed has it</text>
  <text start="317.909" dur="4.111">under control it is contained I mean</text>
  <text start="320.069" dur="5.52">these are all the words they used six</text>
  <text start="322.02" dur="5.489">months later the equity markets began to</text>
  <text start="325.589" dur="5.491">collapse and then accelerated lower</text>
  <text start="327.509" dur="5.97">today an eerie case of deja vu we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="331.08" dur="4.859">saying the same thing think about this</text>

  <text start="341.219" dur="5.22">market much longer what did we see back</text>
  <text start="343.11" dur="5.07">in 2007 moving into 2008 the exact same</text>
  <text start="346.439" dur="5.85">thing now what are we seeing with the</text>
  <text start="348.18" dur="10.729">stock market the same exact thing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="352.289" dur="10.4">seeing this all over again and right now</text>
  <text start="358.909" dur="6.91">we&amp;#39;re seeing manufacturing declining</text>
  <text start="362.689" dur="8.29">we&amp;#39;re seeing more layoffs we saw this</text>
  <text start="365.819" dur="9.201">back in 2007 going into 2008 and at this</text>
  <text start="370.979" dur="6.75">point in time we are headed in the same</text>
  <text start="375.02" dur="5.049">exact direction challenge and grain</text>

  <text start="381.689" dur="5.361">thousand job cuts the highest number</text>
  <text start="384.599" dur="6.03">since 2011 to put this into perspective</text>
  <text start="387.05" dur="5.729">the July cups total is a whopping one</text>
  <text start="390.629" dur="6.27">hundred and thirty-six percent higher</text>

  <text start="398.43" dur="7.259">percent higher than in the same report a</text>
  <text start="400.649" dur="7.591">year ago so what are we seeing I mean</text>

  <text start="470.939" dur="6.78">now that&amp;#39;s so similar to 2008 but there</text>
  <text start="473.999" dur="6.81">is one difference it is much much worse</text>
  <text start="477.719" dur="7.47">this time because you have to remember</text>

  <text start="494.61" dur="4.079">said they never recovered and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="496.139" dur="3.9">lot of people I&amp;#39;ve never recovered we</text>

  <text start="500.039" dur="5.79">upon people they&amp;#39;re still under water in</text>
  <text start="502.379" dur="6.21">their homes and already we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="505.829" dur="5.88">layoffs which started the beginning of</text>
  <text start="508.589" dur="6.39">this year actually they started last</text>
  <text start="511.709" dur="5.76">year but now they&amp;#39;re ramping up and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="514.979" dur="4.98">getting worse we see the BRIC countries</text>
  <text start="517.469" dur="4.98">they have increased seventy percent</text>
  <text start="519.959" dur="4.591">since the group was established in 2009</text>

  <text start="539.939" dur="6.87">suspended indefinitely Turkish sources</text>
  <text start="544.47" dur="4.02">indicate that the suspension may be the</text>
  <text start="546.809" dur="4.38">result of a disagreement about the</text>
  <text start="548.49" dur="4.62">amount of the tariff reductions awarded</text>
  <text start="551.189" dur="3">by Russia now we had talked about this</text>
  <text start="553.11" dur="3.659">that they were going to resume resume</text>
  <text start="554.189" dur="4.65">talks and now we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="556.769" dur="3.57">yeah this thing is called off now this</text>
  <text start="558.839" dur="3.831">might have something to do with Syria</text>
  <text start="560.339" dur="4.021">and what is going on in Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="562.67" dur="4.03">there might be a lot of</text>
  <text start="564.36" dur="4.05">pressure on turkey turkey saying to</text>
  <text start="566.7" dur="4.949">Russia hmm we don&amp;#39;t know at this point</text>
  <text start="568.41" dur="6.09">and it&amp;#39;s starting to look like this so</text>
  <text start="571.649" dur="6.12">Russia now is approaching Pakistan to</text>
  <text start="574.5" dur="5.7">construct a gas pipeline so we see at</text>
  <text start="577.769" dur="6.75">this point in time things are really</text>
  <text start="580.2" dur="7.139">starting to accelerate and as we move</text>
  <text start="584.519" dur="7.051">out of this summer and we move into the</text>

  <text start="591.57" dur="3.84">you think this is going to get better</text>
  <text start="593.07" dur="5.85">that the Atlanta Fed came out and said</text>
  <text start="595.41" dur="5.45">they&amp;#39;re projecting a one percent gdp now</text>

  <text start="616.709" dur="7.291">manipulation this whole thing is done</text>
  <text start="621.5" dur="4.06">but as long as they can keep people</text>

  <text start="625.56" dur="6.87">everything is fine we crawl along here</text>
  <text start="629.579" dur="4.95">but guess what it&amp;#39;s coming to an end</text>
