  <text start="49.11" dur="7.379">financial news as time goes on we are</text>
  <text start="52.739" dur="5.731">hearing more and more bad news about the</text>
  <text start="56.489" dur="4.021">economy now of course the corporate</text>
  <text start="58.47" dur="4.74">media they&amp;#39;re burying a lot of the</text>
  <text start="60.51" dur="4.829">stories they don&amp;#39;t want to discuss it of</text>
  <text start="63.21" dur="4.11">course we&amp;#39;re in that time period where</text>
  <text start="65.339" dur="4.351">there is no bad weather there&amp;#39;s no snow</text>
  <text start="67.32" dur="5.79">it&amp;#39;s not cold and they really can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="69.69" dur="7.5">explain why all this bad news is coming</text>
  <text start="73.11" dur="6.9">out so a lot of the corporate media news</text>
  <text start="77.19" dur="5.19">organizations like to set up polls they</text>
  <text start="80.01" dur="4.95">like to fudge a lot of the numbers and</text>
  <text start="82.38" dur="4.23">they try to make it look like everything</text>
  <text start="84.96" dur="4.14">is doing much much better than it really</text>
  <text start="86.61" dur="4.41">is and of course they want us all</text>
  <text start="89.1" dur="3.24">looking at the stock market because the</text>
  <text start="91.02" dur="2.73">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="92.34" dur="4.52">the high-frequency traders the plunge</text>
  <text start="93.75" dur="5.37">protection team they have the ability to</text>
  <text start="96.86" dur="6.07">keep that propped up they have the</text>
  <text start="99.12" dur="7.53">ability to suppress precious metals they</text>
  <text start="102.93" dur="5.58">have the ability to control the economy</text>
  <text start="106.65" dur="3.96">because really they&amp;#39;re in control of the</text>
  <text start="108.51" dur="4.11">economy the people are sitting on the</text>
  <text start="110.61" dur="4.65">sidelines right now this is a central</text>
  <text start="112.62" dur="4.77">bank economy and they&amp;#39;re creating</text>
  <text start="115.26" dur="3.96">bubbles propping up all the different</text>
  <text start="117.39" dur="4.98">markets trying to figure out all</text>
  <text start="119.22" dur="6.6">different ways where they can manipulate</text>
  <text start="122.37" dur="6.66">the system to keep it going for a little</text>
  <text start="125.82" dur="6.66">bit longer until they can get everything</text>
  <text start="129.03" dur="6.12">into place where they can just let it</text>
  <text start="132.48" dur="6.66">fall to pieces and they can blame this</text>
  <text start="135.15" dur="5.49">on another group another country and we</text>
  <text start="139.14" dur="6.349">see at a Bloomberg they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="140.64" dur="8.28">telling us from their consumer</text>
  <text start="145.489" dur="5.591">information and Bloomberg has a consumer</text>
  <text start="148.92" dur="4.289">comfort index and their can say they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="151.08" dur="5.31">saying that the consumer comfort index</text>
  <text start="153.209" dur="6.151">is on the rise which I find very</text>
  <text start="156.39" dur="5.429">interesting because we&amp;#39;re seeing more</text>
  <text start="159.36" dur="4.55">and more layoffs we&amp;#39;re getting more and</text>
  <text start="161.819" dur="2.091">more</text>
  <text start="164.319" dur="5.31">news about the economy which is falling</text>
  <text start="166.569" dur="6.84">apart but they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us</text>
  <text start="169.629" dur="5.76">that consumers feel a bit more</text>
  <text start="173.409" dur="8.181">comfortable especially when retail sales</text>
  <text start="175.389" dur="11.011">are declining and this reminds me of the</text>
  <text start="181.59" dur="7.269">government paid consumer confidence</text>
  <text start="186.4" dur="4.559">model which is continually rising</text>
  <text start="188.859" dur="3.96">compared to the gallop consumer</text>
  <text start="190.959" dur="3.51">confidence model which is falling</text>
  <text start="192.819" dur="4.551">because one is taken from the actual</text>
  <text start="194.469" dur="6.33">people and the other one is a paid</text>
  <text start="197.37" dur="5.979">organization from the government but</text>
  <text start="200.799" dur="5.731">Bloomberg is saying their consumer</text>
  <text start="203.349" dur="8.78">comfort index is rising at the fastest</text>
  <text start="206.53" dur="10.739">pace since 2009 comfort rose from 41.6</text>
  <text start="212.129" dur="9.881">243 as men dropped from 48.2 to 47.6 so</text>
  <text start="217.269" dur="8.511">women rose up from 40 from 41.6 to 43</text>
  <text start="222.01" dur="9.479">and men dropped in the black community</text>
  <text start="225.78" dur="9.519">we see that they jump from 40.3 to 45.9</text>
  <text start="231.489" dur="6.301">in their comfort level and when I look</text>
  <text start="235.299" dur="4.951">at this something really doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="237.79" dur="3.599">sense because if we take the next step</text>
  <text start="240.25" dur="4.379">and we look at the initial jobless</text>
  <text start="241.389" dur="4.951">claims and we know that many people are</text>
  <text start="244.629" dur="3.39">being laid off at this time we know</text>
  <text start="246.34" dur="4.56">there&amp;#39;s a lot of layoffs a lot of</text>
  <text start="248.019" dur="5.761">corporations are laying off people we</text>
  <text start="250.9" dur="7.549">see that the initial jobless claims they</text>
  <text start="253.78" dur="8.31">plunged to 42 year lows now again</text>
  <text start="258.449" dur="5.411">something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense I mean this</text>
  <text start="262.09" dur="4.98">week the initial jobless claims</text>
  <text start="263.86" dur="4.71">collapsed by seven thousand to 255</text>
  <text start="267.07" dur="6.839">thousands of this is the lowest since</text>
  <text start="268.57" dur="8.64">1973 and when we look at the layoffs</text>
  <text start="273.909" dur="6.48">from challenger grand Christmas we see</text>
  <text start="277.21" dur="5.61">they are rising and the initial jobless</text>
  <text start="280.389" dur="4.53">claims are falling now of course Goldman</text>
  <text start="282.82" dur="4.319">Sachs is out there trying to explain it</text>
  <text start="284.919" dur="4.651">away of why this is happening because a</text>
  <text start="287.139" dur="4.08">lot of people don&amp;#39;t like to apply for it</text>
  <text start="289.57" dur="4.86">and they have all these different</text>
  <text start="291.219" dur="6.841">reasons and calculations to confuse us</text>
  <text start="294.43" dur="6.12">and what&amp;#39;s really happening here is</text>
  <text start="298.06" dur="4.35">is very simple just like the</text>
  <text start="300.55" dur="4.23">unemployment numbers the government is</text>
  <text start="302.41" dur="7.41">sitting there manipulating the numbers</text>
  <text start="304.78" dur="9.69">that&amp;#39;s it it&amp;#39;s one big manipulation game</text>
  <text start="309.82" dur="6.03">and we know that this is complete</text>
  <text start="314.47" dur="4.56">manipulation and we know the corporate</text>
  <text start="315.85" dur="5.52">media tries to figure out all different</text>
  <text start="319.03" dur="5.97">ways to cover up what&amp;#39;s really happening</text>
  <text start="321.37" dur="6.2">and the retail sales they&amp;#39;ve come out</text>
  <text start="325" dur="7.35">and we discussed this yesterday and</text>
  <text start="327.57" dur="7.24">they&amp;#39;re absolutely hopeful and a lot of</text>
  <text start="332.35" dur="5.879">the corporate media is out there they</text>
  <text start="334.81" dur="7.38">kind of bury this information on their</text>
  <text start="338.229" dur="6.511">websites or in newspapers because they</text>
  <text start="342.19" dur="4.32">can&amp;#39;t blame this on snow cold flooding</text>
  <text start="344.74" dur="4.26">drought swarms of locusts or anything</text>
  <text start="346.51" dur="5.879">else so they try to hide this</text>
  <text start="349" dur="5.729">information that the economy isn&amp;#39;t doing</text>
  <text start="352.389" dur="3.84">as well as it is and of course they</text>
  <text start="354.729" dur="3">place a different story on the front</text>
  <text start="356.229" dur="3.66">page or on the front page of the website</text>
  <text start="357.729" dur="3.931">to convince you that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="359.889" dur="5.28">or look over here and they try to</text>
  <text start="361.66" dur="5.34">distract you but when we looked up to</text>
  <text start="365.169" dur="4.971">retail sales we see everything is in</text>
  <text start="367" dur="8.82">decline actually it&amp;#39;s a complete mess</text>
  <text start="370.14" dur="7.39">and when we look at all these</text>
  <text start="375.82" dur="4.56">statistical information like GDP</text>
  <text start="377.53" dur="6.21">inflation and whatnot we see that</text>
  <text start="380.38" dur="4.8">certain things are being propped up in</text>
  <text start="383.74" dur="4.86">all different ways I&amp;#39;ll give you an</text>
  <text start="385.18" dur="6.959">example consumer spending accounts for</text>
  <text start="388.6" dur="6.18">about six to eight percent of the gdp so</text>
  <text start="392.139" dur="4.351">we know consumers aren&amp;#39;t really spending</text>
  <text start="394.78" dur="4.02">that much right now they&amp;#39;re not spending</text>
  <text start="396.49" dur="5.1">on gasoline they&amp;#39;re not spending on</text>
  <text start="398.8" dur="4.589">retail they&amp;#39;re not really out there</text>
  <text start="401.59" dur="5.639">spending their only buying the things</text>
  <text start="403.389" dur="5.131">they absolutely need so in 2008 consumer</text>
  <text start="407.229" dur="3.901">spending accounted for sixty-eight</text>
  <text start="408.52" dur="4.74">percent of GDP here we are seven years</text>
  <text start="411.13" dur="5.19">later and it still represents</text>
  <text start="413.26" dur="5.49">sixty-eight percent of GDP the</text>
  <text start="416.32" dur="6.51">difference is the spending has shifted</text>
  <text start="418.75" dur="8.159">dramatically towards services since we</text>
  <text start="422.83" dur="5.85">had the financial crisis now spending on</text>
  <text start="426.909" dur="3.991">services has grown by thirty one percent</text>
  <text start="428.68" dur="2.459">versus twenty percent for goods since</text>
  <text start="430.9" dur="2.25">two</text>
  <text start="431.139" dur="6.601">thousand eight guess what has caused</text>
  <text start="433.15" dur="7.56">that surge it&amp;#39;s been Obamacare spending</text>
  <text start="437.74" dur="5.489">on health care has skyrocketed they knew</text>
  <text start="440.71" dur="5.97">they needed something to keep the GDP</text>
  <text start="443.229" dur="5.611">numbers up they knew the people wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="446.68" dur="5.069">be spending they know retail is failing</text>
  <text start="448.84" dur="6.419">its contracting people don&amp;#39;t have jobs</text>
  <text start="451.749" dur="6.121">they don&amp;#39;t have the funds so they need</text>
  <text start="455.259" dur="5.851">to substitute the spending so they</text>
  <text start="457.87" dur="6.919">brought in Obamacare what else has</text>
  <text start="461.11" dur="7.94">increased well rent taxes utilities</text>
  <text start="464.789" dur="8.62">educational expenses all of it has</text>
  <text start="469.05" dur="7.479">increased at the same time real median</text>
  <text start="473.409" dur="8.04">household incomes are seven seven</text>
  <text start="476.529" dur="6.39">percent lower than they were in 2008 so</text>
  <text start="481.449" dur="3.78">what do we have here when we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="482.919" dur="5.61">at this whole thing in two thousand</text>
  <text start="485.229" dur="5.55">eight sixty percent 68% was consumer</text>
  <text start="488.529" dur="3.81">spending that made up the gdp seven</text>
  <text start="490.779" dur="3.36">years later they&amp;#39;re telling us it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="492.339" dur="6.271">same exact thing but all they did was</text>
  <text start="494.139" dur="6.74">they took out a huge portion of the</text>
  <text start="498.61" dur="6.41">retail spending and moved it into</text>
  <text start="500.879" dur="8.53">Obamacare and everything else went up</text>
  <text start="505.02" dur="6.519">taxes mortgages rents and everything</text>
  <text start="509.409" dur="6.42">else and they&amp;#39;re saying oh yes GDP is</text>
  <text start="511.539" dur="7.531">still fantastic but people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="515.829" dur="5.82">spending on goods and that&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="519.07" dur="6.42">evident when we look at manufacturing</text>
  <text start="521.649" dur="6.3">and the bolt of dry index now we</text>
  <text start="525.49" dur="5.67">understand in the housing market they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="527.949" dur="5.82">continually pushing up the housing</text>
  <text start="531.16" dur="3.75">prices and people like well you know are</text>
  <text start="533.769" dur="2.581">they trying to get people to purchase</text>
  <text start="534.91" dur="3.39">homes yes that&amp;#39;s one of the reasons</text>
  <text start="536.35" dur="2.76">that&amp;#39;s one of their agendas they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="538.3" dur="3.779">trying to make it look like the</text>
  <text start="539.11" dur="4.589">economy&amp;#39;s doing well and they&amp;#39;re hoping</text>
  <text start="542.079" dur="3.301">that people would just come out and</text>
  <text start="543.699" dur="3.061">purchase homes but they knew it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="545.38" dur="3.36">going to work and they knew it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="546.76" dur="5.009">going to happen and they knew this</text>
  <text start="548.74" dur="4.529">because back in 2013 they started to</text>
  <text start="551.769" dur="3.841">have mass layoffs in the mortgage</text>
  <text start="553.269" dur="3.901">departments because they knew they</text>
  <text start="555.61" dur="3.87">weren&amp;#39;t going to need these people bank</text>
  <text start="557.17" dur="5.669">of america and wells fargo Citibank JP</text>
  <text start="559.48" dur="5.47">Morgan Chase laid off tens of thousands</text>
  <text start="562.839" dur="4.031">of people and it continued on until</text>
  <text start="564.95" dur="3.21">present and you can go back on google</text>
  <text start="566.87" dur="5.73">and check this out you can see all the</text>
  <text start="568.16" dur="6.66">layoffs but the question is why in the</text>
  <text start="572.6" dur="6.17">world did they care so much about</text>
  <text start="574.82" dur="9.33">housing why did they have to prop it up</text>
  <text start="578.77" dur="9.37">well the reason for this is we have to</text>
  <text start="584.15" dur="7.32">look at the big picture here the</text>
  <text start="588.14" dur="7.38">majority of household assets are owned</text>
  <text start="591.47" dur="6.35">by the top 10% and this includes the</text>
  <text start="595.52" dur="5.4">majority of financial assets atop point</text>
  <text start="597.82" dur="5.5">1% own twenty-two percent of all u.s.</text>
  <text start="600.92" dur="5.18">household wealth the top 1% own</text>
  <text start="603.32" dur="7.46">thirty-five percent and the top 10% own</text>
  <text start="606.1" dur="7.09">75% households below that ten percent</text>
  <text start="610.78" dur="7.39">may have financial assets such as</text>
  <text start="613.19" dur="8.16">insurance policies 401ks pensions but a</text>
  <text start="618.17" dur="8.46">house is typically the largest store of</text>
  <text start="621.35" dur="8.52">value the household owns if you want to</text>
  <text start="626.63" dur="5.49">make the top 1% and top 10% happy you</text>
  <text start="629.87" dur="6.12">prop up the stocks and bonds which we</text>
  <text start="632.12" dur="7.23">see but then we have the rest of the</text>
  <text start="635.99" dur="6.02">population now if the housing prices</text>
  <text start="639.35" dur="6.78">went down and they went to all-time lows</text>
  <text start="642.01" dur="6.06">it would be a complete disaster so how</text>
  <text start="646.13" dur="5.19">do they make the other sixty percent</text>
  <text start="648.07" dur="7.3">happy keep them in this illusion that</text>
  <text start="651.32" dur="6.69">they still have a store of wealth well</text>
  <text start="655.37" dur="9.09">they propped up the housing market they</text>
  <text start="658.01" dur="9">pushed the prices up by having the banks</text>
  <text start="664.46" dur="5.73">not foreclose on houses they left they</text>
  <text start="667.01" dur="6.09">kept them off the market they fed gave</text>
  <text start="670.19" dur="5.16">hedge fund&amp;#39;s investment companies free</text>
  <text start="673.1" dur="4.74">money they paid in cash foreign</text>
  <text start="675.35" dur="5.76">investors came in and paid in cash while</text>
  <text start="677.84" dur="5.01">the US population sat on the sidelines</text>
  <text start="681.11" dur="4.46">so those people who have their houses</text>
  <text start="682.85" dur="8.04">they feel better about what is happening</text>
  <text start="685.57" dur="7.27">even though it&amp;#39;s only on paper they just</text>
  <text start="690.89" dur="7.43">have that feeling that everything is</text>
  <text start="692.84" dur="6.88">okay so if the housing market tanked</text>
  <text start="698.32" dur="6.3">it would collapse the middle class</text>
  <text start="699.72" dur="7.93">wealth the sixty percent and they</text>
  <text start="704.62" dur="6.33">couldn&amp;#39;t have this happen they needed it</text>
  <text start="707.65" dur="6.6">propped up to create the illusion and</text>
  <text start="710.95" dur="5.1">this is why they did it now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="714.25" dur="4.38">seeing is everything else is still</text>
  <text start="716.05" dur="6.27">falling apart and we know that all of</text>
  <text start="718.63" dur="6.06">this is basically bubbles housing bubble</text>
  <text start="722.32" dur="4.68">the automobile bubble student loan</text>
  <text start="724.69" dur="5.61">bubble stock market bubble Treasury</text>
  <text start="727" dur="5.4">bubble derivative bubble you name it</text>
  <text start="730.3" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s a bubble and it&amp;#39;s controlled by the</text>
