  <text start="84.82" dur="7.079">broken and we&amp;#39;re gonna see many of these</text>
  <text start="88.03" dur="4.979">individuals being hauled into court we</text>
  <text start="91.899" dur="3.11">also understand there&amp;#39;s an investigation</text>
  <text start="93.009" dur="5.97">going on with FISA that implicates</text>
  <text start="95.009" dur="7.661">Rosenstein Loretta Lynch it implicates</text>
  <text start="98.979" dur="5.401">Obama and many others we also know</text>

  <text start="104.38" dur="5.279">uranium one investigation going on all</text>
  <text start="106.569" dur="3.511">at the same time and what is happening</text>
  <text start="109.659" dur="4.471">right now</text>
  <text start="110.08" dur="7.17">is that as these investigations move</text>
  <text start="114.13" dur="5.73">forward the deep state is getting wind</text>
  <text start="117.25" dur="5.46">and those individuals that are the</text>
  <text start="119.86" dur="4.38">low-hanging fruit they&amp;#39;re gonna get hit</text>
  <text start="122.71" dur="4.38">first and they&amp;#39;re getting very nervous</text>
  <text start="124.24" dur="4.95">and they want to protect themselves so</text>
  <text start="127.09" dur="6.03">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="129.19" dur="6.15">trying to move on Trump to get him very</text>
  <text start="133.12" dur="5.399">quickly on anything they possibly can</text>
  <text start="135.34" dur="4.649">and we could see that right now that</text>
  <text start="138.519" dur="3.931">they&amp;#39;ve been using you know stormy</text>
  <text start="139.989" dur="4.081">Daniels they&amp;#39;ve been using all these</text>
  <text start="142.45" dur="3.18">different things saying that he had sex</text>
  <text start="144.07" dur="4.949">with Playboy models and all this but</text>
  <text start="145.63" dur="4.8">this actually it means nothing at this</text>
  <text start="149.019" dur="3.571">point because it happened before he was</text>
  <text start="150.43" dur="4.529">president and of course they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="152.59" dur="5.31">to link the money that was given to</text>
  <text start="154.959" dur="4.62">stormy Daniels from the attorney back to</text>
  <text start="157.9" dur="4.619">Trump now they&amp;#39;re trying to do all of</text>
  <text start="159.579" dur="6">this and trying to prove that he had</text>
  <text start="162.519" dur="7.56">connections with anyone and what we see</text>
  <text start="165.579" dur="8.88">is that the FBI raided Cohen&amp;#39;s office</text>
  <text start="170.079" dur="6.78">and Trump went crazy over this saying</text>
  <text start="174.459" dur="5.821">this is a whole new level of unfairness</text>
  <text start="176.859" dur="5.761">and he said this is an attack on our</text>
  <text start="180.28" dur="5.31">country and once again he brought up the</text>
  <text start="182.62" dur="4.18">fact no one is looking at the other side</text>
  <text start="185.59" dur="2.53">well</text>
  <text start="186.8" dur="5.22">these individuals that are doing all of</text>
  <text start="188.12" dur="7.05">this they are the other side and he went</text>
  <text start="192.02" dur="7.1">on to say that you know attorney-client</text>
  <text start="195.17" dur="6.18">privilege is dead because he&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="199.12" dur="4.48">because the communication between</text>
  <text start="201.35" dur="6.23">clients and lawyers are usually beyond</text>
  <text start="203.6" dur="6.87">the reach of law enforcement based on</text>
  <text start="207.58" dur="6">constitutional privilege now of course</text>
  <text start="210.47" dur="5.79">are they gonna try to make some type of</text>
  <text start="213.58" dur="5.38">provision or waive this type of</text>
  <text start="216.26" dur="4.17">provision or do something like that to</text>
  <text start="218.96" dur="3.96">try to get that information of course</text>
  <text start="220.43" dur="5.4">they are why do you think there was a</text>
  <text start="222.92" dur="4.68">fire on the 50th floor and I believe his</text>
  <text start="225.83" dur="4.32">office was like something like the 26th</text>
  <text start="227.6" dur="4.47">floor why do you think all of this is</text>
  <text start="230.15" dur="3.57">happening they needed a distraction they</text>
  <text start="232.07" dur="4.32">needed to get in there they were also</text>
  <text start="233.72" dur="5.7">looking at other things during this</text>
  <text start="236.39" dur="7.17">period of time now of course this was</text>
  <text start="239.42" dur="6.39">all signed off by Rod Rosenstein he</text>
  <text start="243.56" dur="5.31">personally approved the FBI rate on</text>
  <text start="245.81" dur="3.69">Trump&amp;#39;s lawyer think about this for a</text>
  <text start="248.87" dur="3.45">second</text>
  <text start="249.5" dur="5.34">he is getting very nervous now Q even</text>
  <text start="252.32" dur="6.539">mentioned this on April 9th saying our</text>
  <text start="254.84" dur="7.23">our problems that again something was</text>
  <text start="258.859" dur="4.771">going on with Rosenstein and he already</text>
  <text start="262.07" dur="5.22">mentioned this and we could see right</text>
  <text start="263.63" dur="6.6">now that there&amp;#39;s a reason why they are</text>
  <text start="267.29" dur="5.879">taking action right now because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="270.23" dur="7.53">nervous and they&amp;#39;re trying to stop what</text>
  <text start="273.169" dur="7.981">is coming now Mueller is taking his</text>
  <text start="277.76" dur="6.39">investigation along with Trump to the</text>
  <text start="281.15" dur="5.94">next level now he&amp;#39;s looking at</text>
  <text start="284.15" dur="5.07">everything the finances the donations to</text>
  <text start="287.09" dur="5.25">his campaign this has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="289.22" dur="5.34">a collusion anymore with Russia this is</text>
  <text start="292.34" dur="4.95">completely off track at this point now</text>
  <text start="294.56" dur="5.04">Mueller is investigating $150,000</text>
  <text start="297.29" dur="4.379">donation to the Trump foundation that</text>
  <text start="299.6" dur="4.38">was given from a pro-european Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="301.669" dur="6.381">businessman during the early days of his</text>
  <text start="303.98" dur="8.12">campaign now he&amp;#39;s looking into this and</text>
  <text start="308.05" dur="9.1">he wants to know what this is all about</text>
  <text start="312.1" dur="6.939">but there&amp;#39;s a catch the Pinchuk who is</text>
  <text start="317.15" dur="4.139">the Ukrainian businessman</text>
  <text start="319.039" dur="4.921">who has a history of supporting a</text>
  <text start="321.289" dur="5.4">pro-european Ukraine was also a major</text>
  <text start="323.96" dur="6.359">Clinton donor now think about this for a</text>
  <text start="326.689" dur="7.35">second he gave the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="330.319" dur="7.231">quite a bit of money he also gave Trump</text>
  <text start="334.039" dur="6.71">a hundred and fifty thousand dollars now</text>
  <text start="337.55" dur="5.669">the amount that he actually gave Clinton</text>
  <text start="340.749" dur="7.39">was a lot more than a hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="343.219" dur="6.69">thousand between 2009 and 2013 including</text>
  <text start="348.139" dur="4.26">when mrs. Clinton was Secretary of State</text>
  <text start="349.909" dur="5.79">the Clinton Foundation received at least</text>
  <text start="352.399" dur="7.531">eight point six million from Victor</text>
  <text start="355.699" dur="6.81">Pinchuk from his foundation according to</text>
  <text start="359.93" dur="4.409">that foundation he gave more than</text>
  <text start="362.509" dur="4.68">thirteen million to the Clinton</text>
  <text start="364.339" dur="6.271">Foundation since 2006 and promised to</text>
  <text start="367.189" dur="5.76">give more meanwhile he paid Trump 150</text>
  <text start="370.61" dur="6.179">thousand so that&amp;#39;s roughly eighty eight</text>
  <text start="372.949" dur="8.041">times more for Clinton than Trump why is</text>
  <text start="376.789" dur="5.85">Mueller looking into Trump I mean</text>
  <text start="380.99" dur="4.349">shouldn&amp;#39;t he be looking into all these</text>
  <text start="382.639" dur="5.46">individuals now think about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="385.339" dur="4.95">happening here this whole thing is being</text>
  <text start="388.099" dur="4.41">pushed right now because they have</text>
  <text start="390.289" dur="4.831">nothing on Trump and they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="392.509" dur="4.41">scared they&amp;#39;re getting nervous and I</text>
  <text start="395.12" dur="3.389">keep hearing and I keep seeing in the</text>
  <text start="396.919" dur="3.571">corporate media that Trump should fire</text>
  <text start="398.509" dur="3.63">Mueller I believe that would be the</text>
  <text start="400.49" dur="4.5">worst thing that he could ever do</text>
  <text start="402.139" dur="4.68">because then it would show that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="404.99" dur="3.389">trying to hide something I think he</text>
  <text start="406.819" dur="3.72">needs to keep Mueller on just like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="408.379" dur="2.76">been doing to show that he has nothing</text>
  <text start="410.539" dur="4.74">to hide</text>
  <text start="411.139" dur="5.851">now again Mueller he is going all over</text>
  <text start="415.279" dur="4.2">the place he has absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="416.99" dur="4.919">we&amp;#39;ve learned that Carter page manna</text>
  <text start="419.479" dur="5.101">fort there all plants and they try to</text>
  <text start="421.909" dur="4.98">push you know the idea to try to get</text>
  <text start="424.58" dur="4.29">other people involved in this but it</text>
  <text start="426.889" dur="3.93">didn&amp;#39;t work out and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="428.87" dur="3.839">right now is the deep state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="430.819" dur="4.5">getting very nervous now at the same</text>
  <text start="432.709" dur="4.83">time all of this is happening we see</text>

  <text start="865.75" dur="5.649">everything is really starting to heat up</text>
  <text start="868.88" dur="4.829">and we can see that the corporate media</text>
  <text start="871.399" dur="5.101">is talking war alternative media</text>
  <text start="873.709" dur="7.231">stations channels are talking war World</text>
  <text start="876.5" dur="9.269">War 3 and whatnot and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="880.94" dur="7.56">point why everyone might think this now</text>
  <text start="885.769" dur="5.161">first of all Russian forces</text>
  <text start="888.5" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;ve been jamming us drones in Syria</text>
  <text start="890.93" dur="7.829">airspace they have incredible technology</text>
  <text start="894.05" dur="7.17">which jams the US drones and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="898.759" dur="6">sophisticated and basically they&amp;#39;re able</text>
  <text start="901.22" dur="7.229">to land the drones or basically crash</text>
  <text start="904.759" dur="5.76">them now this chemical attack that has</text>
  <text start="908.449" dur="5.13">been brought up we knew it was coming</text>
  <text start="910.519" dur="5.55">we had the Intel we knew they were gonna</text>
  <text start="913.579" dur="5.791">try to false flag Russia even warned</text>
  <text start="916.069" dur="6.301">about this and we can see that nikki</text>
  <text start="919.37" dur="7.05">Haley the deep state they&amp;#39;re all out</text>
  <text start="922.37" dur="6.209">there pushing the idea that Assad has</text>
  <text start="926.42" dur="3.96">done this now if you really look at this</text>
  <text start="928.579" dur="4.44">this is the same playbook they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="930.38" dur="5.309">using over and over and over and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="933.019" dur="6.62">still trying to get the same results</text>
  <text start="935.689" dur="7.471">they want the president to order an</text>
  <text start="939.639" dur="6.851">airstrike they want troops in Syria and</text>
  <text start="943.16" dur="6.09">they want Assad taken out they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="946.49" dur="6.029">pushing the same exact goal so what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="949.25" dur="5.55">happening right now well we have a US</text>
  <text start="952.519" dur="5.19">Navy destroyer armed with tomahawks it</text>
  <text start="954.8" dur="5.88">arrived off the Syrian coast and they</text>
  <text start="957.709" dur="4.32">did not notify Russia this is what the</text>
  <text start="960.68" dur="3.719">corporate media is saying but behind the</text>
  <text start="962.029" dur="4.5">scenes they were notified they know</text>
  <text start="964.399" dur="4.29">exactly what&amp;#39;s going on this was</text>
  <text start="966.529" dur="3.99">pre-planned because they knew there was</text>
  <text start="968.689" dur="4.531">going to be some type of false flag and</text>
  <text start="970.519" dur="4.651">this is being orchestrated for the</text>
  <text start="973.22" dur="5.88">corporate media for the deep state to</text>
  <text start="975.17" dur="7.62">basically allow them to show their hand</text>
  <text start="979.1" dur="5.76">and we can see right now Trump is and</text>
  <text start="982.79" dur="4.8">the Patriots are putting on a very big</text>
  <text start="984.86" dur="6.12">production now</text>
  <text start="987.59" dur="6.18">the US has deployed the Truman Carrier</text>

  <text start="1000.49" dur="5.94">guided missile destroyers and many other</text>
  <text start="1003.31" dur="5.55">ships now the thing to realize and we</text>
  <text start="1006.43" dur="6.45">need to go back in time when there was</text>
  <text start="1008.86" dur="6.96">the initial gas attack back in I think</text>
  <text start="1012.88" dur="6.21">it was 2013 the ships were already there</text>
  <text start="1015.82" dur="6.96">they were already there ready to go</text>
  <text start="1019.09" dur="7.25">because this was pre-planned all the</text>
  <text start="1022.78" dur="6.66">ships aren&amp;#39;t there this time so they are</text>
  <text start="1026.34" dur="6.97">taking the ships and they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="1029.44" dur="7.14">selling them to Syria now it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1033.31" dur="5.61">take six to seven days for the group to</text>
  <text start="1036.58" dur="4.05">cross the Atlantic at 30 knots maybe</text>
  <text start="1038.92" dur="4.17">they can push this to five days let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1040.63" dur="6.29">say they do it&amp;#39;s gonna take another</text>
  <text start="1043.09" dur="8.1">three to four days to arrive in the</text>
  <text start="1046.92" dur="8.49">Mediterranean Sea to reach Syria so</text>
  <text start="1051.19" dur="9.68">we&amp;#39;re looking at around nine days or so</text>
  <text start="1055.41" dur="10.57">for the strike group to reach that area</text>
  <text start="1060.87" dur="10.72">what can be done in nine days well we</text>
  <text start="1065.98" dur="8.19">know from q.q said the clowns report</text>
  <text start="1071.59" dur="6.81">needs to be verified verified in all</text>
  <text start="1074.17" dur="7.5">camps which means we need evidence proof</text>
  <text start="1078.4" dur="6.21">that Assad actually did this and I do</text>
  <text start="1081.67" dur="4.77">believe that Trump and the Patriots and</text>
  <text start="1084.61" dur="4.17">Russia they already know that this is a</text>
  <text start="1086.44" dur="4.89">false flag they already know that this</text>
  <text start="1088.78" dur="6.17">was gonna be done now Russia has already</text>
  <text start="1091.33" dur="5.97">vetoed the u.s. resolution in the UN and</text>
  <text start="1094.95" dur="5.17">Russia is going to be submitting their</text>
  <text start="1097.3" dur="5.37">UN resolution to investigate the alleged</text>
  <text start="1100.12" dur="4.35">Syria chemical attack which again the</text>
  <text start="1102.67" dur="4.17">deep state doesn&amp;#39;t want they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1104.47" dur="5.1">an investigation because if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1106.84" dur="5.46">actual individuals that go into Surrey</text>
  <text start="1109.57" dur="5.28">now remember each chemical attack they</text>
  <text start="1112.3" dur="5.79">didn&amp;#39;t have an investigation team go</text>
  <text start="1114.85" dur="5.819">into Syria they just took the reports</text>
  <text start="1118.09" dur="4.309">and said okay here&amp;#39;s our decision</text>
  <text start="1120.669" dur="6.44">they didn&amp;#39;t do any type of investigation</text>
  <text start="1122.399" dur="7.571">now Syria they are going to invite the</text>
  <text start="1127.109" dur="6">OPCW the organization for the</text>
  <text start="1129.97" dur="6.569">prohibition of chemical weapons for a</text>
  <text start="1133.109" dur="8.831">fact-finding midget mission and to visit</text>
  <text start="1136.539" dur="10.22">the DOMA region so they want the team in</text>
  <text start="1141.94" dur="8.339">there on ground zero to gather evidence</text>
  <text start="1146.759" dur="6.73">now think about this for a second if</text>
  <text start="1150.279" dur="6.451">this does happen and they gather</text>
  <text start="1153.489" dur="5.491">evidence the deep state story is going</text>
  <text start="1156.73" dur="5.789">to fall apart because it&amp;#39;s going to show</text>
  <text start="1158.98" dur="6.329">and you know that Syria Russia the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1162.519" dur="6.301">they&amp;#39;re going to make sure that this</text>
  <text start="1165.309" dur="6.541">investigation is going the way they want</text>
  <text start="1168.82" dur="4.77">which means a real investigation not a</text>
  <text start="1171.85" dur="3.12">deep state investigation where they</text>
  <text start="1173.59" dur="4.559">don&amp;#39;t do anything and they just come out</text>
  <text start="1174.97" dur="4.62">with their answer we know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1178.149" dur="3.23">going to investigate and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1179.59" dur="7.549">to find out what really happened here</text>
  <text start="1181.379" dur="9.971">now if we find out that it was staged</text>
  <text start="1187.139" dur="6.61">think of the ramifications think about</text>
  <text start="1191.35" dur="5.34">what would this what this whole thing</text>
  <text start="1193.749" dur="5.37">would mean and we have the strike group</text>
  <text start="1196.69" dur="5.429">coming at the same time maybe the strike</text>
  <text start="1199.119" dur="6.951">group is going to help remove the troops</text>
  <text start="1202.119" dur="8.03">from Syria hmm that&amp;#39;d be interesting</text>
  <text start="1206.07" dur="8.199">maybe take out all the military assets</text>
  <text start="1210.149" dur="7.63">bring them back home that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1214.269" dur="7.88">possibility so we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="1217.779" dur="7.201">the OPCW is going to travel to Syria to</text>
  <text start="1222.149" dur="5.38">investigate what has happened now the UN</text>
  <text start="1224.98" dur="4.59">has admitted that it is unable to</text>
  <text start="1227.529" dur="3.87">independently verify the allegations</text>
  <text start="1229.57" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;re not in a position at this point to</text>
  <text start="1231.399" dur="3.9">independently verify the allegations</text>
  <text start="1233.47" dur="4.589">about the alleged chemical attack and</text>
  <text start="1235.299" dur="4.291">DOMA but obviously any allegation of</text>
  <text start="1238.059" dur="3.541">continued use of chemical weapons is</text>
  <text start="1239.59" dur="4.709">extremely extremely troubling and this</text>
  <text start="1241.6" dur="4.169">is coming from Stefan do jurrac the</text>
  <text start="1244.299" dur="5.791">spokesman for the UN secretary-general</text>
  <text start="1245.769" dur="5.821">and we see that right now there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1250.09" dur="3.089">evidence even though nikki Haley saying</text>
  <text start="1251.59" dur="2.579">we don&amp;#39;t care what the evidence is we</text>
  <text start="1253.179" dur="3.18">need to remove Assad</text>
  <text start="1254.169" dur="3.781">that&amp;#39;s because she knows once they get</text>
  <text start="1256.359" dur="4.38">the evidence it&amp;#39;s going to show that</text>
  <text start="1257.95" dur="5.78">Assad didn&amp;#39;t do this Russia knows it</text>
  <text start="1260.739" dur="5.341">Syria knows it we already know because</text>
  <text start="1263.73" dur="4.419">we already reported that there was going</text>
  <text start="1266.08" dur="3.779">to be a false flag and they were already</text>
  <text start="1268.149" dur="3.66">bringing in the chemicals they were</text>
  <text start="1269.859" dur="3.15">setting it up in this area and we</text>
  <text start="1271.809" dur="4.62">already knew they were going to try to</text>
  <text start="1273.009" dur="7.14">do this now Russia has delivered 40</text>
  <text start="1276.429" dur="6.031">Pansear s1 air defense systems to Syria</text>
  <text start="1280.149" dur="4.14">and it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s designed to defend</text>
  <text start="1282.46" dur="4.439">installations and to provide cover for</text>
  <text start="1284.289" dur="4.74">long-range air defense systems and the</text>
  <text start="1286.899" dur="4.62">Syrian military actively uses the</text>

  <text start="1291.519" dur="3.24">their airfield in other military</text>
  <text start="1292.84" dur="5.029">facilities so they&amp;#39;re bringing in more</text>

  <text start="1297.869" dur="7.63">protect the airfield from attacks just</text>
  <text start="1302.919" dur="6.57">like the one Israel did now France is</text>
  <text start="1305.499" dur="7.92">warning that they will respond if the</text>
  <text start="1309.489" dur="6.331">red line is crossed in Syria and France</text>

  <text start="1320.59" dur="6.779">behind this now once again</text>
  <text start="1322.809" dur="7.291">why would Assad Russia invite the OPCW</text>
  <text start="1327.369" dur="5.4">into Syria to investigate if they are</text>
  <text start="1330.1" dur="6.029">behind this it makes no sense why would</text>
  <text start="1332.769" dur="7.11">they have the OPCW come in there run</text>
  <text start="1336.129" dur="8.701">tests look at the disaster area Ground</text>
  <text start="1339.879" dur="8.76">Zero take samples ask questions talk to</text>
  <text start="1344.83" dur="6.659">people why would they do all of this it</text>
  <text start="1348.639" dur="6.11">doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense and we can see</text>
  <text start="1351.489" dur="6.78">right now it&amp;#39;s because Syria and Russia</text>
  <text start="1354.749" dur="5.831">they&amp;#39;re not behind this they want the</text>
  <text start="1358.269" dur="5.49">truth to come out q is already saying</text>
  <text start="1360.58" dur="4.559">this has to be verified and I think</text>
  <text start="1363.759" dur="4.41">what&amp;#39;s happening right now with all</text>
  <text start="1365.139" dur="5.78">these carrier groups and the ships going</text>
  <text start="1368.169" dur="5.76">over there this is one gigantic</text>
  <text start="1370.919" dur="5.291">production now if the evidence does come</text>
  <text start="1373.929" dur="6.151">out and it shows that it was the white</text>
  <text start="1376.21" dur="8.219">helmets it was the terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="1380.08" dur="6.269">well yeah Russia the u.s. they should</text>

  <text start="1394.85" dur="6.24">weapons in the country and they should</text>
  <text start="1396.68" dur="7.92">be destroyed right but again this is not</text>
  <text start="1401.09" dur="5.88">what the deep state wants but this is</text>
  <text start="1404.6" dur="4.53">one gigantic production at ultrason</text>
  <text start="1406.97" dur="4.29">reminds me of North Korea where they</text>
  <text start="1409.13" dur="4.29">kept saying that you know aircraft</text>
  <text start="1411.26" dur="4.2">carriers are going to North Korea the</text>
  <text start="1413.42" dur="3.57">drills were happening attack is imminent</text>
  <text start="1415.46" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re going to be going in this is how</text>
  <text start="1416.99" dur="5.73">many people gonna be lost it sounds like</text>
  <text start="1419.09" dur="5.94">the same exact thing and this is being</text>
  <text start="1422.72" dur="4.53">played up like there&amp;#39;s no tomorrow</text>
  <text start="1425.03" dur="4.02">but behind the scenes they&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="1427.25" dur="4.71">to the bottom of this and I think this</text>
  <text start="1429.05" dur="7.41">time we&amp;#39;re going to see hard evidence of</text>
  <text start="1431.96" dur="6.96">what really happened in Syria and the</text>
  <text start="1436.46" dur="4.5">finger is going to be pointed at the</text>
  <text start="1438.92" dur="4.65">terrorist groups at the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1440.96" dur="6.18">democratic forces at the white helmets</text>
  <text start="1443.57" dur="7.29">because this needs to be done because</text>
  <text start="1447.14" dur="7.92">we&amp;#39;ve seen this played out time and time</text>
  <text start="1450.86" dur="8.82">again and every single time it turns out</text>
  <text start="1455.06" dur="8.1">to be absolutely fake it&amp;#39;s time to take</text>
  <text start="1459.68" dur="6.33">what has happened and force out who is</text>
  <text start="1463.16" dur="5.67">responsible for this really responsible</text>
  <text start="1466.01" dur="6.06">for this and who sets this up every</text>
  <text start="1468.83" dur="6.12">single time we&amp;#39;re at that point already</text>
  <text start="1472.07" dur="5.31">we see Iran is threatening to restart</text>
  <text start="1474.95" dur="3.89">their nuclear enrichment it can begin</text>
  <text start="1477.38" dur="5.85">within four days and if this happens</text>
  <text start="1478.84" dur="6.4">well guess what the deal is off the</text>
  <text start="1483.23" dur="3.39">Iranian deal that Obama made is</text>
  <text start="1485.24" dur="4.28">completely off now if you really think</text>
  <text start="1486.62" dur="6.18">about this Iranian deal the p5 plus one</text>
  <text start="1489.52" dur="4.93">that Obama made think about why they did</text>
  <text start="1492.8" dur="6.03">this first of all it was to prevent Iran</text>
  <text start="1494.45" dur="7.08">from creating a nuclear weapon and it</text>
  <text start="1498.83" dur="4.98">will allow them to go into Iran because</text>
  <text start="1501.53" dur="3.69">they know from the inspections they</text>
  <text start="1503.81" dur="2.72">didn&amp;#39;t create a nuclear weapons they</text>
  <text start="1505.22" dur="3.24">didn&amp;#39;t have to be afraid of that</text>
  <text start="1506.53" dur="5.44">because they knew they were going to go</text>
  <text start="1508.46" dur="6.9">into Syria then Iran plus they could use</text>
  <text start="1511.97" dur="8.13">the deal as the reason why they could</text>
  <text start="1515.36" dur="5.85">invade Iran now again there are deep</text>
  <text start="1520.1" dur="3.6">state operative</text>
  <text start="1521.21" dur="3.95">inside of Iran that are pushing regime</text>
  <text start="1523.7" dur="5.78">changes like in North Korea</text>
  <text start="1525.16" dur="6.52">creating a nuclear weapon putting the</text>
  <text start="1529.48" dur="4.48">publication out there that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1531.68" dur="5.34">getting ready to develop a nuclear</text>
  <text start="1533.96" dur="5.31">weapon and they want the invading force</text>
  <text start="1537.02" dur="4.53">to come in this is what they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="1539.27" dur="4.02">on it&amp;#39;s the same plan that was happening</text>
  <text start="1541.55" dur="4.35">in North Korea both had deep state</text>
  <text start="1543.29" dur="5.28">operatives within the country they put</text>

  <text start="1548.57" dur="3.57">everyone that you know nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="1550.309" dur="4.761">are being created this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1552.14" dur="6.51">happening time to invade the country</text>
  <text start="1555.07" dur="6.93">it&amp;#39;s done on purpose to get the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1558.65" dur="6.24">involved in invading these countries and</text>
  <text start="1562" dur="6.01">when Q said Iran is next right after</text>
  <text start="1564.89" dur="5.7">North Korea it means not to invade Iran</text>

  <text start="1586.46" dur="3.81">is going to take so long to get there</text>
  <text start="1588.26" dur="4.68">because they want the inspectors to go</text>
