  <text start="124.869" dur="5.911">coming into the presidency everything</text>
  <text start="128.17" dur="4.47">was stacked against him the deep state</text>
  <text start="130.78" dur="3.78">was completely in control the central</text>
  <text start="132.64" dur="5.03">bankers were completely in control and</text>
  <text start="134.56" dur="6.57">they were calling the shots today</text>
  <text start="137.67" dur="5.11">everything has turned around and yes</text>
  <text start="141.13" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re still calling for impeachment</text>
  <text start="142.78" dur="5.04">yes they&amp;#39;re still trying to get him but</text>
  <text start="145.06" dur="5.37">this is going to be a failed attempt the</text>
  <text start="147.82" dur="5.13">central bank right now is completely</text>
  <text start="150.43" dur="4.86">under the control of the patriots it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="152.95" dur="5.91">no longer under the control of the deep</text>
  <text start="155.29" dur="8.279">state everything has been completely</text>
  <text start="158.86" dur="5.95">turned upside down and these people they</text>
  <text start="163.569" dur="3.971">don&amp;#39;t know what to do and</text>
  <text start="164.81" dur="6.81">krump and the Patriots they have set</text>
  <text start="167.54" dur="7.169">this up perfectly think about what they</text>
  <text start="171.62" dur="5.04">have done the reason why Trump is</text>
  <text start="174.709" dur="4.681">continually tweeting out and how great</text>
  <text start="176.66" dur="5">the economy is it&amp;#39;s because he&amp;#39;s setting</text>
  <text start="179.39" dur="5.819">up a narrative he&amp;#39;s setting up a</text>
  <text start="181.66" dur="6.31">blockade where the mainstream media the</text>
  <text start="185.209" dur="5.271">central bank and everyone else they</text>
  <text start="187.97" dur="5.76">can&amp;#39;t do anything about this remember</text>
  <text start="190.48" dur="4.509">the biggest issue no matter what the</text>
  <text start="193.73" dur="3.78">mainstream media tells you no matter</text>
  <text start="194.989" dur="5.641">what anyone tells you is the economy</text>
  <text start="197.51" dur="5.61">because when people lose money people</text>
  <text start="200.63" dur="4.919">pay attention when people aren&amp;#39;t making</text>
  <text start="203.12" dur="4.589">money people pay attention when people</text>
  <text start="205.549" dur="4.77">don&amp;#39;t have jobs people pay attention</text>
  <text start="207.709" dur="8.131">when people are losing jobs people pay</text>
  <text start="210.319" dur="8.161">attention so the economy is the basis of</text>
  <text start="215.84" dur="5.19">everything and then there&amp;#39;s other things</text>
  <text start="218.48" dur="5.819">that offshoot from there and this is why</text>
  <text start="221.03" dur="6.03">Trump made it a point to make sure that</text>
  <text start="224.299" dur="4.981">he has complete and utter control of the</text>
  <text start="227.06" dur="5.22">economy this way the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="229.28" dur="6">the central bank the deep state and many</text>
  <text start="232.28" dur="4.26">other players they can&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="235.28" dur="6.03">about it</text>
  <text start="236.54" dur="7.89">they have been blocked he has set up</text>
  <text start="241.31" dur="7.23">this huge wall and Boyd this wall is</text>
  <text start="244.43" dur="6.24">gigantic where they can&amp;#39;t even touch his</text>
  <text start="248.54" dur="4.56">economy they thought they were going to</text>
  <text start="250.67" dur="4.05">touch it with the central bank they</text>
  <text start="253.1" dur="3.9">thought they were going to touch it with</text>
  <text start="254.72" dur="5.15">the central bank raising rates but now</text>
  <text start="257" dur="5.55">that is completely off the table and</text>
  <text start="259.87" dur="4.419">this is why Trump is continually</text>
  <text start="262.55" dur="7.17">tweeting out I mean take a look at the</text>
  <text start="264.289" dur="10.411">sp500 and the Nasdaq Composite they</text>
  <text start="269.72" dur="11.669">reached new all-time highs I mean since</text>
  <text start="274.7" dur="9.27">2016 that Dow is up 45% so on Election</text>
  <text start="281.389" dur="6.811">Day 2016 November 8th the Dow closed at</text>
  <text start="283.97" dur="8.55">18,000 332 points yesterday the Dow</text>
  <text start="288.2" dur="6.839">closed at what 26650 6 and Trump tweeted</text>
  <text start="292.52" dur="4.079">out the following in the old days if you</text>
  <text start="295.039" dur="2.841">were the President and you had a good</text>
  <text start="296.599" dur="4.311">economy you were</text>
  <text start="297.88" dur="6.69">basically immune from criticism remember</text>
  <text start="300.91" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s the economy stupid today I have as</text>
  <text start="304.57" dur="3.51">president perhaps the greatest economy</text>
  <text start="306.19" dur="7.29">in history and to the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="308.08" dur="8.67">it means nothing but it will now think</text>
  <text start="313.48" dur="6.54">about that for a second he&amp;#39;s telling</text>
  <text start="316.75" dur="6.84">everyone that this economy is so</text>
  <text start="320.02" dur="5.73">fantastic that it does mean something</text>
  <text start="323.59" dur="5.22">now is he talking about the central bank</text>
  <text start="325.75" dur="6.99">economy or is he talking about the new</text>
  <text start="328.81" dur="5.76">economy that he&amp;#39;s assuring in well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="332.74" dur="5.37">the new economy that he&amp;#39;s assuring in</text>
  <text start="334.57" dur="7.26">and he&amp;#39;s going to change everything that</text>
  <text start="338.11" dur="7.58">we know about the economy that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="341.83" dur="7.41">we are headed and this is why he has</text>
  <text start="345.69" dur="5.32">pushed and pushed and pushed to take</text>
  <text start="349.24" dur="3.18">control of the economy when people</text>
  <text start="351.01" dur="3.06">thought there was nothing going on with</text>
  <text start="352.42" dur="4.83">the central bank nothing going on with</text>
  <text start="354.07" dur="6.42">anything he used all their manipulation</text>
  <text start="357.25" dur="6.57">all their magical weapons with the magic</text>
  <text start="360.49" dur="6.03">wand to control the outcome of the</text>
  <text start="363.82" dur="4.47">economy and he will control this through</text>
  <text start="366.52" dur="3.48">the 2020 election and the mainstream</text>
  <text start="368.29" dur="5.01">media the central bank the deep state</text>
  <text start="370" dur="7.38">they all know this they cannot do</text>
  <text start="373.3" dur="7.86">anything about this while this wall is</text>
  <text start="377.38" dur="6.51">up and blocking them behind the wall he</text>
  <text start="381.16" dur="6.18">is changing everything for the better</text>
  <text start="383.89" dur="6.38">he&amp;#39;s redoing all the trade deals he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="387.34" dur="7.92">bringing back jobs deregulating and</text>
  <text start="390.27" dur="7.78">pushing his economic vision and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="395.26" dur="5.49">using tariffs and other weapons to get</text>

  <text start="523.66" dur="4.41">over three years</text>
  <text start="524.77" dur="5.91">why because Trump stopped the rates from</text>

  <text start="530.68" dur="3.6">the rates the mortgage rates I should</text>
  <text start="532.15" dur="4.56">say they&amp;#39;re still ticking up and this is</text>
  <text start="534.28" dur="6.24">why I do believe he&amp;#39;s going to have to</text>
  <text start="536.71" dur="7.26">have the Fed cut rates sooner than later</text>
  <text start="540.52" dur="6.63">we see that the trade talks with China</text>

  <text start="570.85" dur="6.33">know what comes after this once China is</text>
  <text start="574.6" dur="4.26">doing what they say they&amp;#39;re doing Trump</text>
  <text start="577.18" dur="3.36">then we&amp;#39;ll remove the tariffs now will</text>
  <text start="578.86" dur="3.15">this happen you know right after the</text>
  <text start="580.54" dur="2.729">deal is made no he&amp;#39;s going to wait a</text>

  <text start="583.269" dur="5.791">absolutely doing what they promised to</text>
  <text start="585.79" dur="6.96">do now during this whole period Trump</text>
  <text start="589.06" dur="6.42">has completely trapped the Fed and they</text>
  <text start="592.75" dur="6.329">have no way out actually they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="595.48" dur="6.24">control over everything and something</text>
  <text start="599.079" dur="5.101">unexpected has been going on in the</text>
  <text start="601.72" dur="4.799">overnight funding markets since March</text>

  <text start="614.649" dur="2.461">happen</text>
  <text start="615.07" dur="4.35">as a reminder ever since the financial</text>
  <text start="617.11" dur="4.289">crisis in order to push the effective</text>

  <text start="621.399" dur="4.5">trillions in excess reserves the Fed was</text>
  <text start="624.01" dur="3.81">compelled to create a corridor system</text>
  <text start="625.899" dur="4.771">for the Fed Funds rate which was bound</text>
  <text start="627.82" dur="4.23">on the bottom and top by two specific</text>
  <text start="630.67" dur="3.84">rates controlled by the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="632.05" dur="4.38">now the floor for the corridor was the</text>

  <text start="654.279" dur="4.441">to occasionally diverge from this</text>

  <text start="686.649" dur="5.761">rates basically what Trump has done here</text>
  <text start="689.92" dur="4.62">with forcing them to do something that</text>
  <text start="692.41" dur="5.279">they normally wouldn&amp;#39;t do in this</text>
  <text start="694.54" dur="3.88">environment where their entire system is</text>
  <text start="697.689" dur="2.471">falling</text>
  <text start="698.42" dur="3.63">because we know their system is only</text>
  <text start="700.16" dur="4.32">designed to go for a certain period of</text>
  <text start="702.05" dur="5.25">time and then it implodes remember we</text>
  <text start="704.48" dur="4.83">were on track to implode the economy was</text>
  <text start="707.3" dur="4.89">not really getting better it was getting</text>
  <text start="709.31" dur="4.62">worse Trump used their manipulation to</text>
  <text start="712.19" dur="4.53">make it look like the economy was doing</text>
  <text start="713.93" dur="5.16">a lot better and he stopped the Fed from</text>
  <text start="716.72" dur="5.43">doing what they normally would do that</text>
  <text start="719.09" dur="5.22">would be crash the economy he had them</text>
  <text start="722.15" dur="4.56">reverse everything they were doing and</text>
  <text start="724.31" dur="5.91">this way they couldn&amp;#39;t crash the economy</text>
  <text start="726.71" dur="7.17">but now they&amp;#39;re stuck because this is</text>
  <text start="730.22" dur="7.68">their system that they created and the</text>
  <text start="733.88" dur="7.83">system can&amp;#39;t move forward any longer and</text>
  <text start="737.9" dur="7.38">Trump is making them do things that they</text>
  <text start="741.71" dur="7.41">wouldn&amp;#39;t do at this time because they</text>
  <text start="745.28" dur="5.97">know their system is done for that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="749.12" dur="4.05">they wanted an event that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="751.25" dur="3.75">wanted to crash the system that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="753.17" dur="4.02">they wanted to get rid of a lot of this</text>
  <text start="755" dur="4.95">debt that&amp;#39;s why they wanted to bring us</text>
  <text start="757.19" dur="5.16">to war and Trump has now trapped them</text>
  <text start="759.95" dur="6.03">when we talk about how the Fed is</text>
  <text start="762.35" dur="7.65">exposed they are really exposed they</text>
  <text start="765.98" dur="6.39">were exposed on all fronts and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="770" dur="5.58">no way out of this and he&amp;#39;s setting up</text>
  <text start="772.37" dur="6">the perfect storm the perfect storm to</text>
  <text start="775.58" dur="5.7">audit the Fed because when the system</text>
  <text start="778.37" dur="5.4">comes down and Trump has been pushing</text>
  <text start="781.28" dur="3.48">the system to look incredible and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="783.77" dur="4.29">probably gonna put this into overdrive</text>
  <text start="784.76" dur="5.25">as we get closer and closer to 2020 I</text>
  <text start="788.06" dur="4.74">would even be surprised if unemployment</text>
  <text start="790.01" dur="5.1">everything else looks better than it</text>
  <text start="792.8" dur="4.56">does right now and he&amp;#39;ll do this on</text>
  <text start="795.11" dur="5.01">purpose because right after the</text>
  <text start="797.36" dur="4.92">elections and I don&amp;#39;t mean the day after</text>
  <text start="800.12" dur="5.85">I mean maybe a couple months all of a</text>
  <text start="802.28" dur="5.67">sudden the Fed is going to start to do</text>
  <text start="805.97" dur="4.38">things Trump is going to start to blame</text>
  <text start="807.95" dur="4.53">them over and over and over that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="810.35" dur="4.98">ruining the economy they don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="812.48" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re confused they lost</text>
  <text start="815.33" dur="5.1">control they can&amp;#39;t figure out how to</text>
  <text start="817.94" dur="5.04">make how to work the economy he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="820.43" dur="5.06">continually push this out over and over</text>
  <text start="822.98" dur="5.31">and over to convince the people and</text>
  <text start="825.49" dur="5.65">what&amp;#39;s going to happen he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="828.29" dur="5.16">drive this into an audit</text>
  <text start="831.14" dur="5.52">he&amp;#39;s gonna drive this into restructuring</text>
  <text start="833.45" dur="6.96">the Fed he&amp;#39;s going to drive this through</text>
  <text start="836.66" dur="6.66">the transition because this is the plan</text>
  <text start="840.41" dur="5.34">this is what he has to do we can&amp;#39;t stay</text>
  <text start="843.32" dur="6.56">in the system the central bank system</text>
  <text start="845.75" dur="6.48">breeds corruption creates these</text>
  <text start="849.88" dur="4.389">intelligence organizations and the deep</text>
  <text start="852.23" dur="4.41">state where they just keep feeding</text>
  <text start="854.269" dur="4.801">themselves free money and they keep</text>
  <text start="856.64" dur="5.04">stealing and stealing because why the</text>
  <text start="859.07" dur="4.98">central bank allows it they can borrow</text>
  <text start="861.68" dur="3.87">as much as they want yes I know the</text>
  <text start="864.05" dur="3.15">central bank comes back to Congress and</text>
  <text start="865.55" dur="4.229">says well they&amp;#39;re a borrowing they</text>
  <text start="867.2" dur="5.19">should stop that no Congress got corrupt</text>
  <text start="869.779" dur="5.941">because they have an unlimited credit</text>
  <text start="872.39" dur="5.61">card and why would they want to stop</text>
  <text start="875.72" dur="4.59">this they&amp;#39;re becoming wealthier and</text>
  <text start="878" dur="4.5">wealthier they don&amp;#39;t care if they put</text>
  <text start="880.31" dur="5.55">the country into debt they&amp;#39;re becoming</text>
  <text start="882.5" dur="6.779">wealthy and these people can&amp;#39;t see past</text>
  <text start="885.86" dur="6">that but if we had a checks and balance</text>
  <text start="889.279" dur="3.691">system where everything was accounted</text>
  <text start="891.86" dur="2.28">for and you just couldn&amp;#39;t create</text>
  <text start="892.97" dur="3.78">currency out of thin air</text>
  <text start="894.14" dur="6.87">guess what where would they get their</text>
  <text start="896.75" dur="7.199">funds they couldn&amp;#39;t because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="901.01" dur="5.97">more to get this is what&amp;#39;s allocated and</text>
  <text start="903.949" dur="5.281">you have to show results from what was</text>
  <text start="906.98" dur="3.66">allocated you just can&amp;#39;t say well that</text>
  <text start="909.23" dur="3.359">whole program for three billion dollars</text>
  <text start="910.64" dur="5.1">went down the tubes let&amp;#39;s borrow another</text>
  <text start="912.589" dur="4.321">three billion and of course most of this</text>
  <text start="915.74" dur="2.88">money is siphoned off into many</text>
  <text start="916.91" dur="3.59">different companies then brought back to</text>
  <text start="918.62" dur="5.279">them so they can make themselves wealthy</text>
  <text start="920.5" dur="5.709">so you can see the Patriots Trump they</text>
  <text start="923.899" dur="4.021">set this whole thing up to trap the</text>
  <text start="926.209" dur="4.861">central bank to trap the deep state and</text>
