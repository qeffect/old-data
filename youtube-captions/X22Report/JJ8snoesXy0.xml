  <text start="44.96" dur="7.739">shutdown is a cover-up a distraction</text>
  <text start="48.92" dur="7.169">from what is really going on now I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="52.699" dur="5.91">said this in many reports and I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="56.089" dur="5.88">it since I started that the government</text>
  <text start="58.609" dur="7.05">and the Fed will not take the blame for</text>
  <text start="61.969" dur="6.301">the collapse and especially the Fed</text>
  <text start="65.659" dur="5.971">central bankers will not take the blame</text>
  <text start="68.27" dur="7.29">because they need to be seen as the</text>
  <text start="71.63" dur="5.91">saviors the ones who are going to save</text>
  <text start="75.56" dur="4.53">the economy from the collapse that</text>
  <text start="77.54" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re creating so what is happening</text>
  <text start="80.09" dur="8.04">right now to distract everyone Obama is</text>
  <text start="83.63" dur="7.62">out there closing down websites closing</text>
  <text start="88.13" dur="6.5">down memorials making it seem like this</text>
  <text start="91.25" dur="6.42">is a really big issue stonewalling</text>
  <text start="94.63" dur="7">Congress and everything to take the</text>
  <text start="97.67" dur="6.6">focus off of the Fed because what do we</text>
  <text start="101.63" dur="5.36">understand and I&amp;#39;ve been reporting on</text>
  <text start="104.27" dur="5.73">this all throughout the summer the</text>
  <text start="106.99" dur="5.74">propaganda did they been spewing out</text>
  <text start="110" dur="6.06">that the economy is getting better is</text>
  <text start="112.73" dur="7.679">now coming to an end they were hoping</text>
  <text start="116.06" dur="7.53">that the Syrian event would have taken</text>
  <text start="120.409" dur="6.451">hold by now and they would be able to</text>
  <text start="123.59" dur="6.27">blame what is happening on this war that</text>
  <text start="126.86" dur="5.239">started over in the Middle East well the</text>
  <text start="129.86" dur="6.09">American people were not for war</text>
  <text start="132.099" dur="6.37">Congress was not for war and Russia</text>
  <text start="135.95" dur="3.94">stepped in and blew this entire</text>
  <text start="138.469" dur="5.201">operation out of the</text>
  <text start="139.89" dur="8.01">water so what did they have left well</text>
  <text start="143.67" dur="5.789">the Fed couldn&amp;#39;t taper because that was</text>
  <text start="147.9" dur="4.46">off the table because if they started</text>
  <text start="149.459" dur="5.791">the taper what would happen the entire</text>
  <text start="152.36" dur="6.28">economy would implode so they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="155.25" dur="6.33">do that so they don&amp;#39;t have the event</text>
  <text start="158.64" dur="7.86">they couldn&amp;#39;t taper and they understand</text>
  <text start="161.58" dur="9.989">that the economy by itself is coming</text>
  <text start="166.5" dur="8.58">apart at it seems at it seems I mean it</text>
  <text start="171.569" dur="6.42">the whole entire thing was set up and</text>
  <text start="175.08" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s an illusion by the Fed they</text>
  <text start="177.989" dur="5.371">manipulate and they create all the</text>
  <text start="180.84" dur="5.52">numbers and they manufacture these</text>
  <text start="183.36" dur="5.07">numbers to fit their agenda for what</text>
  <text start="186.36" dur="4.19">they wanted to look like just like</text>
  <text start="188.43" dur="4.82">unemployment they change the calculation</text>
  <text start="190.55" dur="5.59">inflation they change the calculation</text>
  <text start="193.25" dur="4.66">GDP they change the calculation and they</text>
  <text start="196.14" dur="4.05">had to go back and you know change it</text>
  <text start="197.91" dur="5.19">again and recalculate it all the way</text>
  <text start="200.19" dur="6.81">from 1929 forward with new information</text>
  <text start="203.1" dur="6.919">to get gdp in the positive area but this</text>
  <text start="207" dur="6.45">is all been an illusion and it has been</text>
  <text start="210.019" dur="6.03">created to keep this illusion going and</text>
  <text start="213.45" dur="6.12">we understand that the eurozone</text>
  <text start="216.049" dur="5.261">government out in Europe was using the</text>
  <text start="219.57" dur="3.78">propaganda telling us that Spain&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="221.31" dur="4.709">recession&amp;#39;s over France was coming out</text>
  <text start="223.35" dur="6.38">of the recession everything is just fine</text>
  <text start="226.019" dur="7.021">and dandy in the u.s. we had Obama</text>
  <text start="229.73" dur="5.62">campaigning that we are in the midst of</text>
  <text start="233.04" dur="5.009">a recovery he was out there telling us</text>
  <text start="235.35" dur="4.979">that the housing is back on track look</text>
  <text start="238.049" dur="7.111">at this this is fantastic because at the</text>
  <text start="240.329" dur="9.961">time their plan was to use this war with</text>
  <text start="245.16" dur="8.07">Syria as the catalyst to say why the</text>
  <text start="250.29" dur="4.83">economy now is collapsing and they were</text>
  <text start="253.23" dur="4.229">going to use this to bring in other</text>
  <text start="255.12" dur="4.95">things and this did not work out for</text>
  <text start="257.459" dur="6.901">them so what what they had to do is now</text>
  <text start="260.07" dur="8.4">regroup and the plan has been set we are</text>
  <text start="264.36" dur="7.02">being distracted at this point to think</text>
  <text start="268.47" dur="5.53">now and you can see by everything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="271.38" dur="5.59">coming out that the economy</text>
  <text start="274" dur="6.9">is failing because of what is happening</text>
  <text start="276.97" dur="7.77">and the longer this goes the worse the</text>
  <text start="280.9" dur="7.62">economy gets and right now the focus is</text>
  <text start="284.74" dur="6.21">on the government not on the Fed the Fed</text>
  <text start="288.52" dur="5.34">is in the background away from</text>
  <text start="290.95" dur="5.7">everything because their instructions</text>
  <text start="293.86" dur="6.69">are the government will take the first</text>
  <text start="296.65" dur="6.51">hit of of what is happening that they</text>
  <text start="300.55" dur="4.8">will be the blame they will they will be</text>
  <text start="303.16" dur="4.23">blamed right now on what is happening</text>
  <text start="305.35" dur="3.69">and the Fed will not because the Fed</text>
  <text start="307.39" dur="5.7">cannot because they want to come in</text>
  <text start="309.04" dur="8.34">later and put in and implement more QE</text>
  <text start="313.09" dur="6.39">and pump up the system even more so what</text>
  <text start="317.38" dur="5.99">is happening right now they are going to</text>
  <text start="319.48" dur="7.32">let this go to the very last moment and</text>
  <text start="323.37" dur="6.4">they are doing this because the they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="326.8" dur="6.03">getting ready for the next full slag</text>
  <text start="329.77" dur="6.39">event and this false flag event will</text>
  <text start="332.83" dur="6.39">take the blame off the government so</text>
  <text start="336.16" dur="5.64">this is done in a couple of stages this</text>
  <text start="339.22" dur="6.03">distraction at this point is taking the</text>
  <text start="341.8" dur="6.75">blame off of the Fed the next event that</text>
  <text start="345.25" dur="6.78">the government is planning will take the</text>
  <text start="348.55" dur="6.39">blame off the government&amp;#39;s failure and</text>
  <text start="352.03" dur="6.81">it will be blamed on another country for</text>
  <text start="354.94" dur="6.57">what is about to happen and this is all</text>
  <text start="358.84" dur="5.76">in motion and they&amp;#39;re getting ready to</text>
  <text start="361.51" dur="5.04">do this before we get into that I&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="364.6" dur="3.66">into that and later in the report here</text>
  <text start="366.55" dur="4.679">but let&amp;#39;s just go through a couple of</text>
  <text start="368.26" dur="5.909">things here we see and again this goes</text>
  <text start="371.229" dur="6.241">along with Europe saying that everything</text>
  <text start="374.169" dur="5.911">is getting better and the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="377.47" dur="4.8">getting better and we can see from every</text>
  <text start="380.08" dur="3.51">time I do this report that things are</text>
  <text start="382.27" dur="6.24">not getting better they&amp;#39;re getting worse</text>
  <text start="383.59" dur="8.52">and I even know that my brother-in-law</text>
  <text start="388.51" dur="8.49">who works for UBS up in the Manhattan</text>
  <text start="392.11" dur="8.28">area is looking like jobs are being let</text>
  <text start="397" dur="6.5">go come this November so something is</text>
  <text start="400.39" dur="6.3">happening we understand from Meredith</text>
  <text start="403.5" dur="4.029">Whitney she did a report saying about a</text>
  <text start="406.69" dur="4.379">hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="407.529" dur="7.64">jobs up in the wall street area is going</text>
  <text start="411.069" dur="6.21">to is going to happen in November or so</text>
  <text start="415.169" dur="5.92">where they&amp;#39;re going to get rid of a lot</text>
  <text start="417.279" dur="6.18">of people and right now we could see</text>
  <text start="421.089" dur="5.04">this happening everywhere in Portugal if</text>
  <text start="423.459" dur="10.01">everything is fine why do they need</text>
  <text start="426.129" dur="12.06">another 5.5 I&amp;#39;m sorry a 7.4 billion</text>
  <text start="433.469" dur="8.89">dollar rescue loan which is 5.5 billion</text>
  <text start="438.189" dur="6.45">euros why do they need a rescue loan if</text>
  <text start="442.359" dur="5.31">things are improving and things are</text>
  <text start="444.639" dur="7.5">getting better the reason why because</text>
  <text start="447.669" dur="8.31">it&amp;#39;s not the unemployment in a Cypress</text>
  <text start="452.139" dur="7.2">right now is at its highest level it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="455.979" dur="6.9">at 17.3 percent at this point in time if</text>
  <text start="459.339" dur="5.94">we go back a year okay when they told us</text>
  <text start="462.879" dur="4.38">Greece and all these other places</text>
  <text start="465.279" dur="3.42">everything was doing fine and we</text>
  <text start="467.259" dur="3.87">understand that Greece got the first</text>
  <text start="468.699" dur="5.01">bailout almost a year ago their</text>
  <text start="471.129" dur="4.8">unemployment was at 23 point when T</text>
  <text start="473.709" dur="4.59">three-point-one percent a year later</text>
  <text start="475.929" dur="7.23">from all these bailouts and from doing</text>
  <text start="478.299" dur="7.95">whatever the the IMF tells them to do by</text>
  <text start="483.159" dur="6.39">taking more debt laying off more people</text>
  <text start="486.249" dur="6.361">you know the unemployment shoots up to</text>
  <text start="489.549" dur="5.94">around twenty seven percent cyprus from</text>
  <text start="492.61" dur="5.369">a year ago was at 11.7 because of the</text>
  <text start="495.489" dur="3.75">bail ins and bailouts then laying off a</text>
  <text start="497.979" dur="3.93">lot of people a lot of businesses</text>
  <text start="499.239" dur="4.44">closing capital controls in effect we</text>
  <text start="501.909" dur="5.61">see the unemployment at seventeen</text>
  <text start="503.679" dur="5.43">percent and slovenia is the same thing a</text>
  <text start="507.519" dur="4.29">year ago as eight point eight percent</text>
  <text start="509.109" dur="4.381">and now it&amp;#39;s 11.2 percent so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="511.809" dur="3.09">seeing this happen all over the place</text>
  <text start="513.49" dur="5.399">where unemployment in all these areas</text>
  <text start="514.899" dur="6.901">are either staying at the rate they are</text>
  <text start="518.889" dur="5.55">or inching up we even see it in germany</text>
  <text start="521.8" dur="5.07">where unemployment has inched up about</text>
  <text start="524.439" dur="5.971">two percent or point two percent already</text>
  <text start="526.87" dur="6.24">and we are seeing this especially in the</text>
  <text start="530.41" dur="5.219">u.s. if we are not using the manipulated</text>
  <text start="533.11" dur="6.74">numbers the unemployment here is between</text>
  <text start="535.629" dur="4.221">23 and 24 percent</text>
  <text start="539.92" dur="5.599">now we understand that Greece has had</text>
  <text start="542.32" dur="5.94">multiple bailouts they had a layoff</text>
  <text start="545.519" dur="4.781">25,000 people and in there in process of</text>
  <text start="548.26" dur="4.53">doing this the unemployment is so high</text>
  <text start="550.3" dur="4.86">they don&amp;#39;t have the revenue to pay for</text>
  <text start="552.79" dur="4.289">the interest on this dead so what are</text>
  <text start="555.16" dur="5.22">they looking to do they are looking to</text>
  <text start="557.079" dur="5.94">do some type of bail in and the Greek</text>
  <text start="560.38" dur="4.829">labour social insurance ministry is</text>
  <text start="563.019" dur="4.711">seriously considering a drastic measure</text>
  <text start="565.209" dur="5.041">in order to obtain the social security</text>
  <text start="567.73" dur="4.65">contributions owed by enterprises and to</text>
  <text start="570.25" dur="5.55">avoid having a slash pensions and</text>
  <text start="572.38" dur="5.28">benefits it&amp;#39;s a drastic measure the</text>
  <text start="575.8" dur="4.68">ministry is planning to force companies</text>
  <text start="577.66" dur="5.729">to pay up or face having their assets</text>
  <text start="580.48" dur="5.64">seized so that the 14 billion euros of</text>
  <text start="583.389" dur="5.671">contributions to can be recouped and</text>
  <text start="586.12" dur="6.149">they&amp;#39;re looking to do a major type of</text>
  <text start="589.06" dur="5.76">bailing and we can see how all these</text>
  <text start="592.269" dur="5.281">countries and everywhere this is</text>
  <text start="594.82" dur="6.209">starting to happen and right now here in</text>
  <text start="597.55" dur="6.39">the US to keep the government running</text>
  <text start="601.029" dur="5.071">they are raiding the pension plans right</text>
  <text start="603.94" dur="4.29">now that&amp;#39;s where the extraordinary</text>
  <text start="606.1" dur="4.229">measures are coming from they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="608.23" dur="4.44">it from the pensions and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="610.329" dur="5.221">promising to pay it back once the debt</text>
  <text start="612.67" dur="4.38">ceiling is raised so this is how the</text>
  <text start="615.55" dur="6.3">government is actually staying open</text>
  <text start="617.05" dur="6.899">right now because really again no one is</text>
  <text start="621.85" dur="4.47">bringing up the main issue home which is</text>
  <text start="623.949" dur="4.83">the problem is that the US has too much</text>
  <text start="626.32" dur="5.699">debt raising the debt ceiling doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="628.779" dur="5.43">change anything it just puts a bandaid</text>
  <text start="632.019" dur="5.461">on it and now there is more interest</text>
  <text start="634.209" dur="6.421">with less revenue and this can never</text>
  <text start="637.48" dur="5.46">ever be sustained it will come to it</text>
  <text start="640.63" dur="5.13">will it will completely implode on</text>
  <text start="642.94" dur="5.97">itself and we can see it is already</text>
  <text start="645.76" dur="5.819">happening now we&amp;#39;ve talked a lot about</text>
  <text start="648.91" dur="4.83">retail sales I went all the way back to</text>
  <text start="651.579" dur="3.95">februari in the USA Today article saying</text>
  <text start="653.74" dur="5.25">that all these stores Barnes &amp;amp; Noble</text>
  <text start="655.529" dur="6.25">best buy gamestop they&amp;#39;re all closing</text>
  <text start="658.99" dur="5.789">stores hundreds and hundreds of stores</text>

  <text start="676.57" dur="5.34">many many different retail outlets and</text>
  <text start="679.06" dur="6.06">now what they&amp;#39;re saying and this is</text>
  <text start="681.91" dur="5.04">something that has to go along with it</text>
  <text start="685.12" dur="4.59">because since people are unemployed</text>
  <text start="686.95" dur="6.09">underemployed and we know what the real</text>
  <text start="689.71" dur="6.33">and unemployment numbers are this makes</text>
  <text start="693.04" dur="5.93">sense for a third straight month of</text>
  <text start="696.04" dur="8.7">there&amp;#39;s a decline in credit card usage</text>
  <text start="698.97" dur="7.3">in consumer spending and the reason for</text>
  <text start="704.74" dur="4.11">this is because when you do not have</text>
  <text start="706.27" dur="5.759">money and your cards are maxed to the</text>
  <text start="708.85" dur="7.14">top there is nothing left and you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="715.99" dur="5.64">usage when we saw the increase in credit</text>
  <text start="718.99" dur="5.28">card usage people didn&amp;#39;t have cash so</text>
  <text start="721.63" dur="5.76">what did they resort to a resort to</text>
  <text start="724.27" dur="6">credit cards they resort to okay I need</text>
  <text start="727.39" dur="5.43">food I need this I need clothing all the</text>
  <text start="730.27" dur="5.37">things I need I use my credit card when</text>
  <text start="732.82" dur="5.37">those get maxed out you start to see the</text>
  <text start="735.64" dur="4.68">usage of credit cards start to decline</text>
  <text start="738.19" dur="6.83">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that right now</text>
  <text start="740.32" dur="8.16">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see retail</text>
  <text start="745.02" dur="6.04">retailers they understand that there is</text>

  <text start="1526.57" dur="6.24">banks we do understand that there is a</text>
  <text start="1530.05" dur="8.13">power grid drill happening in November</text>
  <text start="1532.81" dur="8.61">in the UK they also have something which</text>
  <text start="1538.18" dur="7.89">is dubbed Operation waking shark to</text>
  <text start="1541.42" dur="8.34">which is set to happen in mid-november</text>
  <text start="1546.07" dur="7.62">and this is going to be a cyber attack</text>
  <text start="1549.76" dur="6.84">on UK banks they&amp;#39;re going to do the same</text>
  <text start="1553.69" dur="7.41">type of simulation that is happening</text>
  <text start="1556.6" dur="6.93">here in the US now when I talk about all</text>
  <text start="1561.1" dur="5.13">of these things happening it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1563.53" dur="5.37">mean that they&amp;#39;re going to happen right</text>
  <text start="1566.23" dur="5.64">at the time that these drills are</text>
  <text start="1568.9" dur="5.22">happening now they could we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="1571.87" dur="5.19">happen many times but these are highly</text>
  <text start="1574.12" dur="6.9">publicized drills a lot of people know</text>
  <text start="1577.06" dur="6.24">about them so could it happen yes is</text>
  <text start="1581.02" dur="5.34">this in preparation for something else</text>
  <text start="1583.3" dur="5.79">that could be happening yes I believe</text>
  <text start="1586.36" dur="7.38">all these training exercises or do you</text>
  <text start="1589.09" dur="7.95">get things into place for the main cyber</text>
  <text start="1593.74" dur="7.86">attack and do I think this cyber attack</text>
  <text start="1597.04" dur="7.65">is coming soon yes I do I believe there</text>
  <text start="1601.6" dur="6.33">is a false a flag false flag event go</text>
  <text start="1604.69" dur="5.37">to happen because right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1607.93" dur="5.79">keeping everyone distracted with this</text>
  <text start="1610.06" dur="7.49">shutdown they are making plans we saw</text>
  <text start="1613.72" dur="6.45">what happened in DC with this woman</text>
  <text start="1617.55" dur="5.56">supposedly a woman we&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="1620.17" dur="5.73">inside the car we&amp;#39;ve never seen the</text>
  <text start="1623.11" dur="5.37">woman being taken out of the car so this</text>
  <text start="1625.9" dur="6.54">could be all propaganda at this point</text>
  <text start="1628.48" dur="8.55">and I&amp;#39;ve said this in my other reports</text>
  <text start="1632.44" dur="6.51">that it looked to me like DC was having</text>
  <text start="1637.03" dur="4.08">a drill and I understand there was a</text>
  <text start="1638.95" dur="4.5">drill scheduled at this time and this</text>
  <text start="1641.11" dur="5.04">was one of this is the last day of the</text>
  <text start="1643.45" dur="5.19">drill and it completely looked like a</text>
  <text start="1646.15" dur="4.92">drill the announcements came on they</text>
  <text start="1648.64" dur="4.26">told people to stay in their homes lock</text>
  <text start="1651.07" dur="3.93">their doors don&amp;#39;t look out the windows</text>
  <text start="1652.9" dur="5.43">don&amp;#39;t go near the windows they had</text>
  <text start="1655" dur="6.09">Congress being protected and moved they</text>
  <text start="1658.33" dur="6.92">had the police take their positions and</text>
  <text start="1661.09" dur="8.12">guard the DC area and the entire thing</text>
  <text start="1665.25" dur="8.38">looked like a drill that was set up for</text>
  <text start="1669.21" dur="7.36">something that will be coming and we</text>
  <text start="1673.63" dur="4.83">have to remember that this next false</text>
  <text start="1676.57" dur="6.66">flag like I said in the beginning of</text>
  <text start="1678.46" dur="7.47">this report the Fed at this point does</text>
  <text start="1683.23" dur="5.13">not want to be blamed for what is coming</text>
  <text start="1685.93" dur="4.95">because you have to remember the central</text>
  <text start="1688.36" dur="4.5">banker the feds the elite the globalist</text>
  <text start="1690.88" dur="5.31">whatever you want to call them they want</text>
  <text start="1692.86" dur="5.76">to do keep this system going and once</text>
  <text start="1696.19" dur="5.52">the system dies they want to replace it</text>
  <text start="1698.62" dur="5.4">with something else the government right</text>
  <text start="1701.71" dur="4.44">now is taking the heat and the blame for</text>
  <text start="1704.02" dur="5.52">what is happening but they are going to</text>
  <text start="1706.15" dur="5.91">use a false flag to shift everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1709.54" dur="5.01">attention off of them onto another</text>
  <text start="1712.06" dur="5.76">nation and this is going to come in the</text>
  <text start="1714.55" dur="6.78">form of these cyber attacks and physical</text>
  <text start="1717.82" dur="5.31">attacks we cannot rule out the physical</text>
  <text start="1721.33" dur="6.71">attacks because they&amp;#39;ve been building up</text>
  <text start="1723.13" dur="8.79">the propaganda for al Qaeda al shabaab</text>
  <text start="1728.04" dur="6.37">lone wolf groups roaming around the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1731.92" dur="5.53">and we understand there are many things</text>
  <text start="1734.41" dur="4.96">that I&amp;#39;ve been reported on</text>
  <text start="1737.45" dur="5.339">their nukes have been moved without</text>
  <text start="1739.37" dur="6.269">paperwork they were already and i ran</text>
  <text start="1742.789" dur="6.24">for people in there trying to sabotage</text>
  <text start="1745.639" dur="6.871">or do something and they are trying to</text>
  <text start="1749.029" dur="6.62">make this entire thing work for them</text>
  <text start="1752.51" dur="6.84">because they understand that the market</text>
  <text start="1755.649" dur="5.351">cannot hold itself together that much</text>
  <text start="1759.35" dur="4.74">longer I mean the economy cannot hold</text>
  <text start="1761" dur="6.96">itself together that much longer and for</text>
  <text start="1764.09" dur="6.179">those people who are not taking money</text>
  <text start="1767.96" dur="6.75">out of the bank what I would suggest at</text>
  <text start="1770.269" dur="7.561">this point is every day make a printout</text>
  <text start="1774.71" dur="6.03">of what you have in your account now my</text>
  <text start="1777.83" dur="5.219">opinion I would take out the money but</text>
  <text start="1780.74" dur="4.5">you know some people don&amp;#39;t want to do</text>
  <text start="1783.049" dur="4.141">that and I don&amp;#39;t know why I would only</text>
  <text start="1785.24" dur="3.75">keep the amount that I need for bills in</text>
  <text start="1787.19" dur="4.44">there but for those people who are</text>
  <text start="1788.99" dur="5.309">keeping their cash in the bank I would</text>
  <text start="1791.63" dur="5.659">make a printout of what you have in</text>
  <text start="1794.299" dur="10.291">there and I&amp;#39;m going to explain why</text>
  <text start="1797.289" dur="10.811">because when this event hits and banks</text>
  <text start="1804.59" dur="5.309">go on a bank holiday and all systems are</text>
  <text start="1808.1" dur="6.87">completely compromised from this cyber</text>
  <text start="1809.899" dur="7.801">attack how is anyone going to prove what</text>
  <text start="1814.97" dur="5.699">they had in their account most people</text>
  <text start="1817.7" dur="7.8">today do their banking on their iPhone</text>
  <text start="1820.669" dur="8.49">or on their computers at home and they</text>
  <text start="1825.5" dur="6.299">see the amounts that they have some</text>
  <text start="1829.159" dur="5.691">people have their statements still mail</text>
  <text start="1831.799" dur="6.691">to them but again those are a month old</text>
  <text start="1834.85" dur="6.789">you will need to prove up to that day</text>
  <text start="1838.49" dur="5.22">what you have in your account and for</text>
  <text start="1841.639" dur="5.071">those people who are not going to take</text>
  <text start="1843.71" dur="6.87">out their money for whatever reason they</text>
  <text start="1846.71" dur="5.429">have my personal opinion would to only</text>
  <text start="1850.58" dur="3.689">leave the amount of money that you need</text>
  <text start="1852.139" dur="3.981">in for bills but for those people who</text>
  <text start="1854.269" dur="6.331">are keeping their money in the bank I</text>
  <text start="1856.12" dur="6.49">would make a print out every day to show</text>
  <text start="1860.6" dur="6.24">the amount that you have because when</text>
  <text start="1862.61" dur="7.35">this hits and you you know you know you</text>
  <text start="1866.84" dur="4.2">have 11,000 let&amp;#39;s say in the bank and it</text>
  <text start="1869.96" dur="4.35">shows 200</text>
  <text start="1871.04" dur="8.39">how are you going to prove it it will be</text>
  <text start="1874.31" dur="9">impossible to prove and this entire</text>
  <text start="1879.43" dur="8.32">cyberattack event with a physical attack</text>
  <text start="1883.31" dur="8.13">will then take the blame off of the US</text>
  <text start="1887.75" dur="8.82">government and shift this onto either</text>
  <text start="1891.44" dur="8.55">Iran Syria China Russia whatever country</text>
  <text start="1896.57" dur="5.31">they are going to use at this point most</text>
  <text start="1899.99" dur="5.46">likely it&amp;#39;s going to be Iran or Syria at</text>
  <text start="1901.88" dur="6.09">this time and they will shift now the</text>
  <text start="1905.45" dur="6.06">blame off the government so the shift</text>
  <text start="1907.97" dur="5.73">the economy will be coming down the</text>
  <text start="1911.51" dur="5.22">blame that the government once had</text>
  <text start="1913.7" dur="6.57">because of this whole debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="1916.73" dur="5.58">debacle will now be removed and the</text>
  <text start="1920.27" dur="5.01">government and the shed will be in the</text>
  <text start="1922.31" dur="7.08">clear and another country will take the</text>
  <text start="1925.28" dur="6.75">blame listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
  <text start="1929.39" dur="5.75">listening be well be safe and especially</text>
