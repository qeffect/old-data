  <text start="76.45" dur="5.76">news now we had a crazy day on the</text>
  <text start="80.02" dur="5.97">market we saw the market was down quite</text>
  <text start="82.21" dur="5.31">a bit we see gold is surging and we see</text>
  <text start="85.99" dur="3.66">that things are starting to break apart</text>
  <text start="87.52" dur="4.41">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="89.65" dur="5.76">corporate media was out there and prior</text>
  <text start="91.93" dur="5.25">to the ECB making their announcement</text>
  <text start="95.41" dur="3.21">draggy making his announcement which</text>
  <text start="97.18" dur="2.76">completely manipulated the markets</text>
  <text start="98.62" dur="4.62">because this is what they do at this</text>
  <text start="99.94" dur="6.15">point we had headlines like Wall Street</text>
  <text start="103.24" dur="7.74">gains as weak data Spurs stimulus hopes</text>
  <text start="106.09" dur="7.35">and then as soon as the ECB made the</text>
  <text start="110.98" dur="4.35">announcement all of a sudden we get</text>
  <text start="113.44" dur="5.07">another thing saying Wall Street surges</text>
  <text start="115.33" dur="5.67">as data points to economic recovery and</text>
  <text start="118.51" dur="5.43">then all of a sudden the market started</text>
  <text start="121" dur="6.51">to fall apart at the rally started to</text>
  <text start="123.94" dur="6">end so all of a sudden we see european</text>
  <text start="127.51" dur="6.54">stocks turn lower as ECB says more rate</text>
  <text start="129.94" dur="10.159">cuts unlikely banks up and we see that</text>
  <text start="134.05" dur="10.53">all of this was completely manipulated</text>
  <text start="140.099" dur="8.621">it was manipulated to push the markets</text>
  <text start="144.58" dur="7.29">higher and it didn&amp;#39;t work the markets</text>
  <text start="148.72" dur="5.73">came down they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="151.87" dur="6.23">possibly can at this point to keep this</text>
  <text start="154.45" dur="6.24">system alive a little bit longer and</text>
  <text start="158.1" dur="5.53">it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder as time</text>
  <text start="160.69" dur="3.84">goes on what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="163.63" dur="4.65">the initial</text>
  <text start="164.53" dur="6.57">those claims here in the States they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="168.28" dur="7.14">saying that they&amp;#39;re at all-time lows at</text>
  <text start="171.1" dur="5.55">this point near 43 year lows and we know</text>
  <text start="175.42" dur="2.37">these numbers are manipulated because</text>
  <text start="176.65" dur="3.84">when we look at the eyes and</text>
  <text start="177.79" dur="6.98">manufacturing employment the IM services</text>
  <text start="180.49" dur="6.54">employment they are sky rocketing upward</text>
  <text start="184.77" dur="4.84">so we&amp;#39;re seeing more and more</text>
  <text start="187.03" dur="7.17">unemployment in these areas we know that</text>
  <text start="189.61" dur="8.37">retail unemployment is on the rise so</text>
  <text start="194.2" dur="7.88">where are they getting the numbers for</text>
  <text start="197.98" dur="8.13">initial jobless claims at all-time lows</text>
  <text start="202.08" dur="10.26">we can see at this point that every</text>
  <text start="206.11" dur="10.23">single thing is completely manipulated</text>
  <text start="212.34" dur="7.66">right now during this real estate</text>
  <text start="216.34" dur="6.3">recovery that the US government central</text>
  <text start="220" dur="7.11">bankers have told us we&amp;#39;re in but if you</text>
  <text start="222.64" dur="8.49">look at home sales if you look at</text>
  <text start="227.11" dur="7.02">mortgage applications you see it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="231.13" dur="5.46">flatline we&amp;#39;ve gone nowhere it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="234.13" dur="6.329">little blip up from where we were back</text>
  <text start="236.59" dur="5.91">in 2008-2009 yes prices have gone up and</text>
  <text start="240.459" dur="3.661">they&amp;#39;re able to manipulate that because</text>
  <text start="242.5" dur="3.84">they can tell the bank&amp;#39;s listen you know</text>
  <text start="244.12" dur="4.44">the foreclosed houses don&amp;#39;t let them on</text>
  <text start="246.34" dur="4.44">the market you keep the inventory off</text>
  <text start="248.56" dur="6.48">the market guess what people think</text>
  <text start="250.78" dur="6.209">there&amp;#39;s no supply so prices go up we</text>
  <text start="255.04" dur="4.499">have foreign investors we have hedge</text>
  <text start="256.989" dur="4.761">funds investment companies purchasing</text>
  <text start="259.539" dur="5.611">thousands upon thousands of houses</text>
  <text start="261.75" dur="6.39">keeping them off the market why to drive</text>
  <text start="265.15" dur="8.1">the prices up and this creates a bubble</text>
  <text start="268.14" dur="10.06">but we have six million homeowners still</text>
  <text start="273.25" dur="8.91">underwater and this is during a period</text>
  <text start="278.2" dur="9.93">where they increased the prices of their</text>
  <text start="282.16" dur="8.22">homes using bubble tactics and we also</text>
  <text start="288.13" dur="3.93">see that eight hundred and twenty</text>
  <text start="290.38" dur="4.02">thousand of those borrowers owing the</text>
  <text start="292.06" dur="4.5">bank twice the amount their homes are</text>
  <text start="294.4" dur="4.13">worth and this is coming from Zillow</text>
  <text start="296.56" dur="5.79">negative echo to report</text>
  <text start="298.53" dur="6.01">so when we look at this we have to</text>
  <text start="302.35" dur="4.17">scratch our heads and think okay if this</text>
  <text start="304.54" dur="4.41">is during a period where prices have</text>
  <text start="306.52" dur="4.98">gone up not everywhere in certain cities</text>
  <text start="308.95" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re seeing prices come down I&amp;#39;m seeing</text>
  <text start="311.5" dur="4.44">houses longer and longer on the market</text>
  <text start="313.36" dur="5.01">price is coming down the real estate</text>
  <text start="315.94" dur="4.71">market is crumbling and falling apart</text>
  <text start="318.37" dur="5.55">what is going to happen to all those</text>
  <text start="320.65" dur="4.74">people that purchased homes to all those</text>
  <text start="323.92" dur="3.45">hedge funds investment companies that</text>
  <text start="325.39" dur="3.66">purchase homes to all the foreign</text>
  <text start="327.37" dur="4.29">investors that purchased homes at the</text>
  <text start="329.05" dur="7.41">height of the market at the height of</text>
  <text start="331.66" dur="9.09">the bubble and when this comes down we</text>
  <text start="336.46" dur="6.75">have the six million plus now everybody</text>
  <text start="340.75" dur="5.55">else because you know when the real</text>
  <text start="343.21" dur="6.15">estate market the bubble pops it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="346.3" dur="6">to be worse than 2008 prices are going</text>
  <text start="349.36" dur="6.3">to drop twice as much as they once did</text>
  <text start="352.3" dur="6.42">so that six million number is going to</text>
  <text start="355.66" dur="11.82">skyrocket and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="358.72" dur="11.91">absolutely awful we see that the rallies</text>
  <text start="367.48" dur="8.58">that we&amp;#39;re seeing right now in iron or</text>
  <text start="370.63" dur="8.16">copper Baltic Dry Index stocks well it</text>
  <text start="376.06" dur="6.36">doesn&amp;#39;t seem they actually pass the</text>
  <text start="378.79" dur="8.43">sniff test and when we look at this</text>
  <text start="382.42" dur="8.46">closely has anything changed as the</text>
  <text start="387.22" dur="7.07">economy gotten better know as retail</text>
  <text start="390.88" dur="6.33">expanded no corporate revenues have</text>
  <text start="394.29" dur="6.46">corporations making more sales are they</text>
  <text start="397.21" dur="6.75">bringing in more money no is</text>
  <text start="400.75" dur="5.1">manufacturing getting better no is the</text>
  <text start="403.96" dur="5.07">service sector getting better actually</text>
  <text start="405.85" dur="7.11">it&amp;#39;s declining now is the restaurants</text>
  <text start="409.03" dur="8.72">the food industry getting better no</text>
  <text start="412.96" dur="8.49">that&amp;#39;s declining also so what&amp;#39;s changed</text>
  <text start="417.75" dur="9.25">nothing actually things have gotten</text>
  <text start="421.45" dur="7.32">worse and what does this tell you it</text>
  <text start="427" dur="7.139">tells you</text>
  <text start="428.77" dur="8.97">that nothing explains why we are seeing</text>
  <text start="434.139" dur="8.041">these rallies because we&amp;#39;re not seeing</text>
  <text start="437.74" dur="7.5">any of this this is completely fake</text>
  <text start="442.18" dur="5.31">phony and false it is driven by the</text>
  <text start="445.24" dur="6.72">central bankers the US government they</text>
  <text start="447.49" dur="10.29">are manipulating the market to make</text>
  <text start="451.96" dur="10.59">everyone believe that we are still fine</text>
  <text start="457.78" dur="9.62">and this is what we see during the</text>
  <text start="462.55" dur="8.19">endgame it is legalized looting and</text>
  <text start="467.4" dur="7.259">financialization and you can see the</text>
  <text start="470.74" dur="7.14">market is fluctuating up and down</text>
  <text start="474.659" dur="6.331">because it really wants to go down but</text>
  <text start="477.88" dur="6.349">the manipulators are keeping it up and</text>
  <text start="480.99" dur="5.799">we&amp;#39;re seeing that as we move forward</text>
  <text start="484.229" dur="6.101">it&amp;#39;s going to be harder and harder for</text>
  <text start="486.789" dur="7.171">them to keep the system alive think</text>
  <text start="490.33" dur="6.69">about this global liquidity has</text>
  <text start="493.96" dur="7.23">collapsed right now it is collapsed back</text>
  <text start="497.02" dur="8.78">to 2008 crisis levels now the last time</text>
  <text start="501.19" dur="8.629">that this happened guess what happened</text>
  <text start="505.8" dur="9">we went into the Great Recession and</text>
  <text start="509.819" dur="11.621">we&amp;#39;re seeing it right now where exactly</text>
  <text start="514.8" dur="11.83">where we started from and this doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="521.44" dur="6.93">look good moving forward and everything</text>
  <text start="526.63" dur="6.12">that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all these</text>
  <text start="528.37" dur="6.87">economic indicators shows you that we</text>
  <text start="532.75" dur="6.45">are headed for this incredible collapse</text>
  <text start="535.24" dur="6.15">of the entire system now during the Wolf</text>
  <text start="539.2" dur="5.449">Wolf Richter interview he believes that</text>
  <text start="541.39" dur="7.439">this is going to be a slow decline of</text>
  <text start="544.649" dur="6.731">the crash unless the bubbles pop and</text>
  <text start="548.829" dur="5.461">then everything just falls apart we have</text>
  <text start="551.38" dur="4.47">other people out there saying that this</text>
  <text start="554.29" dur="3.81">entire thing is going to come down very</text>
  <text start="555.85" dur="3.45">quickly I believe that this is going to</text>
  <text start="558.1" dur="2.67">come down very quickly because when I</text>
  <text start="559.3" dur="3.39">look at all the economic indicators and</text>
  <text start="560.77" dur="4.23">everything that we looked at</text>
  <text start="562.69" dur="5.82">it shows us that this entire thing has</text>
  <text start="565" dur="7.11">been manipulated and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="568.51" dur="5.04">lose control eventually and if they</text>
  <text start="572.11" dur="4.8">don&amp;#39;t lose control they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="573.55" dur="7.17">bring it down on their own now out in</text>
  <text start="576.91" dur="5.91">Saudi Arabia we see they are running</text>
  <text start="580.72" dur="3.9">into big problems we understand their</text>
  <text start="582.82" dur="3.54">suppressing the oil prices under the</text>
  <text start="584.62" dur="3.75">instructions of the United States to put</text>
  <text start="586.36" dur="5.97">pressure on Russia to keep the economy</text>
  <text start="588.37" dur="5.43">alive to have people have extra currency</text>
  <text start="592.33" dur="3.42">in their pockets that go out and spend</text>
  <text start="593.8" dur="6.51">and retail but that&amp;#39;s not working it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="595.75" dur="7.5">also allowing corporations to bring in</text>
  <text start="600.31" dur="5.51">more revenue because the cost of</text>
  <text start="603.25" dur="5.7">deliveries the cost of production the</text>
  <text start="605.82" dur="5.41">airlines the cost of flying has gone</text>
  <text start="608.95" dur="3.63">down but guess what they don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="611.23" dur="3.36">lower the prices if they keep their</text>
  <text start="612.58" dur="5.67">prices where they were or just drop them</text>
  <text start="614.59" dur="6.24">a slight percentage they&amp;#39;re able to make</text>
  <text start="618.25" dur="5.61">profits and a lot of the companies are</text>
  <text start="620.83" dur="6.15">able to stay in business now if all of a</text>
  <text start="623.86" dur="6.42">sudden these oil prices skyrocketed we</text>
  <text start="626.98" dur="6.15">would see a major financial problem</text>
  <text start="630.28" dur="4.14">right now across everywhere everything</text>
  <text start="633.13" dur="2.82">would just come to a screeching halt and</text>
  <text start="634.42" dur="3.66">this is the reason one of the reasons</text>
  <text start="635.95" dur="4.65">they needed to do this at this point but</text>
  <text start="638.08" dur="5.61">we can see Saudi Arabia they&amp;#39;re in big</text>
  <text start="640.6" dur="5.91">trouble they&amp;#39;re looking to borrow six to</text>
  <text start="643.69" dur="4.23">eight billion and this would be the</text>
  <text start="646.51" dur="3.51">first significant borrowing by the</text>
  <text start="647.92" dur="6.75">kingdom&amp;#39;s government for more than a</text>
  <text start="650.02" dur="9.06">decade this is how bad it&amp;#39;s getting out</text>
  <text start="654.67" dur="7.35">in Ukraine we see that Kiev is going to</text>
  <text start="659.08" dur="4.83">sell Ukrainian coal mines as part of the</text>
  <text start="662.02" dur="5.16">country&amp;#39;s plan to privatize their state</text>
  <text start="663.91" dur="5.64">assets Kiev is collapsing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="667.18" dur="6.84">selling off bits and pieces of the</text>

  <text start="697.66" dur="5.429">have direct influence on this price this</text>
  <text start="700.2" dur="4.72">is also a sign that precious metal</text>
  <text start="703.089" dur="6.741">markets are increasingly going</text>
  <text start="704.92" dur="8.24">international now we notice that</text>

  <text start="718.089" dur="6.391">the gold prices and eventually what</text>
  <text start="721.39" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re going to see is the prices of both</text>
  <text start="724.48" dur="4.38">of these metals because we know that</text>
  <text start="725.68" dur="4.89">China purchased a lot of precious metals</text>
  <text start="728.86" dur="5.55">so did Russia and many other countries</text>
  <text start="730.57" dur="7.47">not the u.s. we will see this rise and</text>
  <text start="734.41" dur="7.7">we know in April that we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="738.04" dur="7.86">the yuan based fixed price on gold and</text>
  <text start="742.11" dur="6.99">that system comes online so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
