  <text start="39.75" dur="4.02">assets in the Mediterranean now we have</text>
  <text start="42.449" dur="3.151">to look at the big picture here now we</text>
  <text start="43.77" dur="4.14">see the Middle East and we understand</text>
  <text start="45.6" dur="4.5">the United States central bankers came</text>
  <text start="47.91" dur="3.96">into all these countries they overthrew</text>
  <text start="50.1" dur="4.049">the government pretty much got rid of</text>
  <text start="51.87" dur="4.68">them place the puppet regimes in these</text>
  <text start="54.149" dur="5.311">countries to set up a private western</text>
  <text start="56.55" dur="5.099">central bank and to set up the US dollar</text>
  <text start="59.46" dur="4.11">as the reserve currency because they</text>
  <text start="61.649" dur="4.891">wanted all the natural resources to be</text>
  <text start="63.57" dur="6.03">sold using the US dollar which which in</text>
  <text start="66.54" dur="5.46">turn other countries would then need to</text>
  <text start="69.6" dur="4.379">keep the US dollar in reserves and it</text>
  <text start="72" dur="4.02">would keep the flow of US dollars and</text>
  <text start="73.979" dur="4.741">prop the system up for a little bit</text>
  <text start="76.02" dur="4.919">longer what has been happening though is</text>

  <text start="94.979" dur="3.78">government is in a corner and of course</text>
  <text start="97.619" dur="3.151">they made a call out to the</text>
  <text start="98.759" dur="3.93">international community and they said</text>

  <text start="109.59" dur="4.529">to take back the country so of course</text>
  <text start="111.96" dur="4.17">the United States came out and said okay</text>
  <text start="114.119" dur="5.46">we will give you two months and if you</text>
  <text start="116.13" dur="6.54">cannot contain the situation the United</text>
  <text start="119.579" dur="5.311">States and NATO and UN we will come in</text>
  <text start="122.67" dur="4.769">there and help you now of course we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="124.89" dur="5.7">just heard that the United States has</text>
  <text start="127.439" dur="5.731">dispatched the USS Bataan to go into the</text>
  <text start="130.59" dur="5.61">Mediterranean it is a an assault ship it</text>
  <text start="133.17" dur="5.069">has about a thousand Marines and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="136.2" dur="3.75">really know if you need a thousand</text>
  <text start="138.239" dur="6.691">Marines and an assault</text>
  <text start="139.95" dur="7.86">ship to evacuate the people in Libya now</text>
  <text start="144.93" dur="4.949">again they&amp;#39;ve set up travel advisories</text>
  <text start="147.81" dur="4.56">they set up other advisories and</text>
  <text start="149.879" dur="4.47">warnings and this is how we know that</text>
  <text start="152.37" dur="5.22">something is going to happen now this</text>
  <text start="154.349" dur="4.92">also could be used for Syria because we</text>
  <text start="157.59" dur="3.509">understand there are military exercises</text>
  <text start="159.269" dur="3.901">going on in Jordan the same time the</text>
  <text start="161.099" dur="5.071">elections are going on and their ship</text>
  <text start="163.17" dur="5.73">could be also diverted right to Syria</text>
  <text start="166.17" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s right in the Mediterranean so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="168.9" dur="3.75">going to have to watch this very closely</text>
  <text start="170.04" dur="4.62">to see how this is going to play out at</text>
  <text start="172.65" dur="4.08">this time but we&amp;#39;ll get into that a</text>
  <text start="174.66" dur="3.51">little bit more during this report but</text>
  <text start="176.73" dur="4.44">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="178.17" dur="5.129">news now we understand that in France</text>
  <text start="181.17" dur="5.819">the president of France last year during</text>
  <text start="183.299" dur="5.041">the false flag event with Syria he was</text>
  <text start="186.989" dur="3.06">out there and of course United States</text>
  <text start="188.34" dur="3.84">was out there the European Union was out</text>
  <text start="190.049" dur="4.831">there telling us how we are in this</text>
  <text start="192.18" dur="5.69">fantastic recovery and we&amp;#39;re pulling out</text>
  <text start="194.88" dur="6.21">of it and everything looks great well</text>
  <text start="197.87" dur="5.47">none of that has come true actually the</text>
  <text start="201.09" dur="4.14">opposite has been happening right now</text>
  <text start="203.34" dur="6.45">the number of people without jobs in</text>
  <text start="205.23" dur="8.069">France rose by 14,800 in April to a new</text>
  <text start="209.79" dur="7.38">record well when is this recovery coming</text>
  <text start="213.299" dur="7.291">I guess it isn&amp;#39;t and it is ticked up and</text>
  <text start="217.17" dur="6.68">increased by 0.4% over one month and</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="5.94">three point five percent over one year</text>
  <text start="223.85" dur="4.87">so we can see the unemployment rate is</text>
  <text start="226.53" dur="3.66">continually rising we&amp;#39;re seeing this not</text>
  <text start="228.72" dur="3.93">just in France we&amp;#39;re seeing it in many</text>
  <text start="230.19" dur="4.47">countries because the debt in the</text>
  <text start="232.65" dur="4.89">countries cannot be sustained they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="234.66" dur="5.1">continuing with austerity there is no</text>
  <text start="237.54" dur="6.39">growth there is no business there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="239.76" dur="7.199">nothing and it continually gets worse as</text>
  <text start="243.93" dur="7.139">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing now Germany they are</text>
  <text start="246.959" dur="6.81">reporting that unemployment unexpectedly</text>
  <text start="251.069" dur="4.711">jumped the most in five years well</text>
  <text start="253.769" dur="3.571">what&amp;#39;s happening it&amp;#39;s starting to spread</text>
  <text start="255.78" dur="3.269">to other countries and this is what</text>
  <text start="257.34" dur="4.17">happens we saw it back in the Great</text>
  <text start="259.049" dur="4.921">Depression Europe was in a depression it</text>
  <text start="261.51" dur="4.129">spread very slowly across Europe we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="263.97" dur="6.17">seeing the same thing happened right now</text>
  <text start="265.639" dur="6.751">unemployment in April jumped to 20 3937</text>
  <text start="270.14" dur="3.61">economists were only expecting about</text>
  <text start="272.39" dur="3.28">15,000</text>
  <text start="273.75" dur="5.25">and this is the worst they&amp;#39;ve seen in</text>
  <text start="275.67" dur="5.67">five years so all of this and everything</text>
  <text start="279" dur="3.87">that we&amp;#39;ve been seeing it is not getting</text>
  <text start="281.34" dur="4.32">better it&amp;#39;s actually getting worse</text>
  <text start="282.87" dur="5.46">because this is starting to spread there</text>
  <text start="285.66" dur="5.16">is too much debt in Europe there is too</text>
  <text start="288.33" dur="5.73">much debt in the United States it cannot</text>
  <text start="290.82" dur="5.67">be sustained and this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="294.06" dur="4.38">seeing the situation&amp;#39;s get worse now of</text>
  <text start="296.49" dur="3.93">course they&amp;#39;re manipulating and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="298.44" dur="3.69">trying to keep the illusion alive and</text>
  <text start="300.42" dur="3.33">they realize they can anymore it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.13" dur="3.09">getting very very difficult to do this</text>
  <text start="303.75" dur="3">and each time they come out with a</text>
  <text start="305.22" dur="3.99">report they you know they blame it on</text>
  <text start="306.75" dur="5.37">the weather they blame it on the Earth&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="309.21" dur="5.22">rotation and they continually make up</text>
  <text start="312.12" dur="3.51">stories and of course those people who</text>
  <text start="314.43" dur="4.71">want to believe that can believe that</text>
  <text start="315.63" dur="8.07">but we see from real indicators and real</text>
  <text start="319.14" dur="6.51">economic indicators that things are not</text>
  <text start="323.7" dur="3.84">what they say they&amp;#39;re actually that</text>
  <text start="325.65" dur="4.17">that&amp;#39;s actually happening here and of</text>
  <text start="327.54" dur="4.74">course I say this over and over every</text>
  <text start="329.82" dur="4.83">time a government government official or</text>
  <text start="332.28" dur="4.83">the Fed or the central bankers tell us</text>
  <text start="334.65" dur="4.83">that things are okay that it&amp;#39;s improving</text>
  <text start="337.11" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re in a recovery we always know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="339.48" dur="4.32">the opposite because they never tell us</text>
  <text start="341.43" dur="5.22">the truth they lie they lie they lie</text>
  <text start="343.8" dur="6.39">that&amp;#39;s all they do because they need to</text>
  <text start="346.65" dur="6.21">keep you completely in the dark of</text>
  <text start="350.19" dur="4.44">what&amp;#39;s really happening but we know</text>
  <text start="352.86" dur="4.26">better we understand what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="354.63" dur="5.49">happening and we are preparing for this</text>
  <text start="357.12" dur="7.86">now here in the United States what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="360.12" dur="7.53">seeing right now is that the central</text>
  <text start="364.98" dur="4.89">bankers need to spread spread more debt</text>
  <text start="367.65" dur="3.78">in the United States because that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="369.87" dur="3.18">they keep the system going this is why</text>
  <text start="371.43" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re continually invading countries</text>
  <text start="373.05" dur="4.56">setting up private western central banks</text>
  <text start="375" dur="5.85">issuing more dollars and right now just</text>
  <text start="377.61" dur="6.57">like with housing just like with cars</text>
  <text start="380.85" dur="5.58">car loans they are bringing in these</text>
  <text start="384.18" dur="4.44">subprime people reducing the</text>
  <text start="386.43" dur="4.29">qualifications because they want to</text>
  <text start="388.62" dur="3.84">spread that debt out and it prompts up</text>
  <text start="390.72" dur="4.62">the system a little bit longer because</text>
  <text start="392.46" dur="4.77">this whole system is a debt system now</text>
  <text start="395.34" dur="5.07">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is there</text>
  <text start="397.23" dur="6.99">easing student loans standards they want</text>
  <text start="400.41" dur="6.379">more students to take out debt the US</text>
  <text start="404.22" dur="4.77">government is poised to ease loan stand</text>
  <text start="406.789" dur="4.6">bloomberg reports parents whose</text>
  <text start="408.99" dur="4.26">financial standing disqualified them for</text>
  <text start="411.389" dur="3.631">most loans will have an easier time</text>
  <text start="413.25" dur="4.289">boring to pay their children&amp;#39;s college</text>
  <text start="415.02" dur="4.92">costs under a US government proposal to</text>
  <text start="417.539" dur="4.201">ease credit credit standards the</text>
  <text start="419.94" dur="5.039">Education Department wants to look at</text>
  <text start="421.74" dur="6.48">adverse credit over two years instead of</text>
  <text start="424.979" dur="5.34">five and consider approving loans even</text>
  <text start="428.22" dur="4.62">if parents have delinquent credit</text>
  <text start="430.319" dur="5.401">balances according to an agency document</text>
  <text start="432.84" dur="5.639">released this month now as we know and I</text>
  <text start="435.72" dur="5.939">reported out on this before eighty</text>
  <text start="438.479" dur="7.081">percent of the youths who are coming out</text>
  <text start="441.659" dur="6.57">of college cannot even find jobs in</text>
  <text start="445.56" dur="3.87">their major they&amp;#39;re taking part time</text>
  <text start="448.229" dur="4.111">jobs they&amp;#39;re living with their parents</text>
  <text start="449.43" dur="5.19">they can&amp;#39;t paint pay these loans back</text>
  <text start="452.34" dur="4.799">and remember you have to pay these loans</text>
  <text start="454.62" dur="4.979">back you can&amp;#39;t you can default on it but</text>
  <text start="457.139" dur="7.53">you still owe the money no matter what</text>
  <text start="459.599" dur="7.741">and we can see right now these college</text>
  <text start="464.669" dur="5.31">students these other people that will be</text>
  <text start="467.34" dur="4.829">going in and taking up these loans they</text>
  <text start="469.979" dur="4.111">will just have debt they will not be</text>
  <text start="472.169" dur="4.68">able to find jobs they will not be able</text>
  <text start="474.09" dur="4.59">to work they will not be able to pay off</text>
  <text start="476.849" dur="3.57">this debt and what will happen after</text>
  <text start="478.68" dur="3.959">come out of college is the government</text>
  <text start="480.419" dur="4.74">will come in and say oh now you can join</text>
  <text start="482.639" dur="4.861">up to our program that that defers the</text>
  <text start="485.159" dur="4.26">payments that gives you smaller payments</text>
  <text start="487.5" dur="4.05">because we understand it you just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="489.419" dur="4.53">have a job right now and you can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="491.55" dur="5.489">one and I use this example of my wife&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="493.949" dur="6.541">cousin and graduated Binghamton dismay</text>
  <text start="497.039" dur="5.341">he was looking for jobs and there was he</text>
  <text start="500.49" dur="3.57">went for an interview for a job which</text>
  <text start="502.38" dur="4.05">was fourteen dollars an hour for 20</text>
  <text start="504.06" dur="4.229">hours a week that was the job he can</text>
  <text start="506.43" dur="4.53">find they would know he was said he</text>
  <text start="508.289" dur="5.581">continually setting on his resume no</text>
  <text start="510.96" dur="5.129">answers coming back whatsoever so it is</text>
  <text start="513.87" dur="5.37">very tough right now and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="516.089" dur="5.76">difficult to get some type of work and</text>
  <text start="519.24" dur="4.14">this is going to be a disaster for the</text>
  <text start="521.849" dur="4.711">youth of America we have to remember the</text>
  <text start="523.38" dur="5.16">youth of America this is a foundation</text>
  <text start="526.56" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re supposed to even graduate high</text>
  <text start="528.54" dur="5.91">school go to college get a job start</text>
  <text start="531.75" dur="5.82">saving money start spending money in the</text>
  <text start="534.45" dur="6.22">retail market continually save money get</text>
  <text start="537.57" dur="5.41">married purchase a home</text>
  <text start="540.67" dur="5.76">and this is not going to happen right</text>
  <text start="542.98" dur="5.73">now because most of these people can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="546.43" dur="4.26">save money because there&amp;#39;s not making</text>
  <text start="548.71" dur="5.28">any money so it is going to be very very</text>
  <text start="550.69" dur="5.79">difficult now in the world of housing</text>
  <text start="553.99" dur="5.49">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is mortgage rates are</text>
  <text start="556.48" dur="6.02">falling but purchase applications are</text>
  <text start="559.48" dur="6.84">falling refinancing is falling it is all</text>
  <text start="562.5" dur="5.56">falling declining imploding it is not</text>
  <text start="566.32" dur="3.9">getting better mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="568.06" dur="4.08">decreased by one point two percent from</text>
  <text start="570.22" dur="4.2">one week earlier according to the</text>
  <text start="572.14" dur="4.74">Mortgage Bankers Association the</text>
  <text start="574.42" dur="5.22">refinance index is down seventy-three</text>
  <text start="576.88" dur="5.16">percent from the levels in May of 2013</text>
  <text start="579.64" dur="5.7">now this is kind of strange because you</text>
  <text start="582.04" dur="5.22">know with all the employment and all the</text>
  <text start="585.34" dur="4.58">new jobs that are being created all</text>
  <text start="587.26" dur="6.18">these people should be purchasing homes</text>
  <text start="589.92" dur="6.01">buying more in retail but we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="593.44" dur="6.3">seeing this because these numbers are</text>
  <text start="595.93" dur="7.68">fake they&amp;#39;re an illusion that&amp;#39;s not real</text>
  <text start="599.74" dur="7.83">and we understand that going back to</text>
  <text start="603.61" dur="7.08">August of 2013 when Wells Fargo Citibank</text>
  <text start="607.57" dur="5.91">Bank of America they were laying off</text>
  <text start="610.69" dur="4.53">their mortgage departments if the</text>
  <text start="613.48" dur="4.14">mortgage industry the housing industry</text>
  <text start="615.22" dur="4.71">was expanding and more people were</text>
  <text start="617.62" dur="4.53">buying homes because they had employment</text>
  <text start="619.93" dur="4.17">these departments would be expanding but</text>
  <text start="622.15" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;re seeing them contract and now</text>
  <text start="624.1" dur="5.43">here&amp;#39;s rbs guess what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="626.89" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re laying off people in their</text>
  <text start="629.53" dur="4.32">mortgage trading businesses about</text>
  <text start="631.78" dur="5.64">two-thirds of the people now this is</text>
  <text start="633.85" dur="6.93">kind of odd because isn&amp;#39;t housing</text>
  <text start="637.42" dur="7.02">recovering all i see is contraction i</text>

  <text start="1588.94" dur="5.67">left there so there&amp;#39;s no one left</text>
  <text start="1590.89" dur="7.59">standing so we can see what is going on</text>
  <text start="1594.61" dur="5.58">in this area the United States central</text>
  <text start="1598.48" dur="3.51">bankers are completely losing control</text>
  <text start="1600.19" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re losing control in Libya at this</text>
  <text start="1601.99" dur="6.54">time and of course the United States is</text>
  <text start="1603.85" dur="7.02">saying we need to evacuate the people in</text>
  <text start="1608.53" dur="4.62">the embassy the United States has a vide</text>

  <text start="1624.22" dur="5.31">travel advisory we see closing of the</text>
  <text start="1626.41" dur="5.28">embassy we see evacuation right before</text>
  <text start="1629.53" dur="4.95">the United States central bankers decide</text>
  <text start="1631.69" dur="5.94">to go into the country so it in Sudan we</text>
  <text start="1634.48" dur="5.55">saw it in Ukraine we saw it in other</text>
  <text start="1637.63" dur="3.84">African nations we are seeing the same</text>
  <text start="1640.03" dur="4.529">thing and also we saw it during the</text>
  <text start="1641.47" dur="5.97">August of 2013 when they did that whole</text>
  <text start="1644.559" dur="5.071">blanket evacuation of all the embassies</text>
  <text start="1647.44" dur="4.5">because they were really ramping up the</text>
  <text start="1649.63" dur="3.66">drone strikes in Yemen pushing the</text>
  <text start="1651.94" dur="3.239">people back in all the other countries</text>
  <text start="1653.29" dur="4.35">and we can see the same thing is</text>
  <text start="1655.179" dur="4.321">happening here and of course they went</text>
  <text start="1657.64" dur="4.35">on to say that due to security concerns</text>
  <text start="1659.5" dur="4.5">the Department of State has limited</text>
  <text start="1661.99" dur="4.02">staffing at embassy in Tripoli and is</text>
  <text start="1664" dur="4.8">only able to offer very limited limited</text>
  <text start="1666.01" dur="5.1">emergency services to u.s. citizens in</text>
  <text start="1668.8" dur="6.06">Libya at this time now we understand the</text>
  <text start="1671.11" dur="5.67">USS bataan is coming into the area it is</text>
  <text start="1674.86" dur="3.9">going through the Suez Canal entering</text>

  <text start="1680.47" dur="8.28">assault ship and they are bringing this</text>
  <text start="1684.61" dur="5.91">into evacuate the people in Libya now I</text>
  <text start="1688.75" dur="4.22">don&amp;#39;t know if you really need an assault</text>
  <text start="1690.52" dur="5.28">ship with a thousand Marines on it for</text>
  <text start="1692.97" dur="6.52">evacuation purposes and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1695.8" dur="6.42">limited staff there anyhow so this seems</text>
  <text start="1699.49" dur="4.98">a little bit of an overkill now the ship</text>
  <text start="1702.22" dur="5.91">most likely is there not just to</text>
  <text start="1704.47" dur="7.11">evacuate but to bring forces into Libya</text>
  <text start="1708.13" dur="5.28">or to be used later on in Syria and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1711.58" dur="3.39">a great way of bringing this in and we</text>
  <text start="1713.41" dur="3.6">have to remember that the Libyan</text>
  <text start="1714.97" dur="4.62">government has given a call out to the</text>
  <text start="1717.01" dur="4.38">international community and the United</text>
  <text start="1719.59" dur="3.78">States did answer saying that will give</text>
  <text start="1721.39" dur="5.28">you two months and here we are already</text>
  <text start="1723.37" dur="7.41">and the situation in Libya is getting</text>
  <text start="1726.67" dur="6.509">worse and worse and again what has been</text>
  <text start="1730.78" dur="6.3">going on there is that the people of</text>
  <text start="1733.179" dur="6.541">Libya have attacked the the Libya&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1737.08" dur="4.53">Prime Minister they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>

  <text start="1741.61" dur="2.97">feel that he&amp;#39;s for the people and the</text>
  <text start="1743.679" dur="2.431">all that</text>
  <text start="1744.58" dur="4.92">we have to remember the u.s. also has</text>

  <text start="1749.5" dur="5.309">aircraft a 3 refueling aircraft in Italy</text>

  <text start="1765.88" dur="5.779">are ready to push this agenda forward</text>

  <text start="1804.1" dur="4.38">worked with the CIA once before and we</text>
