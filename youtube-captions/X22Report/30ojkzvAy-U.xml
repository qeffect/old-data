  <text start="346.96" dur="8.31">most closed opaque agencies to the press</text>
  <text start="350.59" dur="7.2">and we can see right now Trump wants to</text>
  <text start="355.27" dur="5.25">see what they&amp;#39;re working on what data</text>
  <text start="357.79" dur="6.86">they&amp;#39;re putting out there what contracts</text>
  <text start="360.52" dur="6.45">they have what deals they are making and</text>
  <text start="364.65" dur="4.93">we see that they&amp;#39;re trying to say well</text>
  <text start="366.97" dur="5.16">the Trump administration they made us</text>
  <text start="369.58" dur="5.4">take down the climate change page welp</text>
  <text start="372.13" dur="4.86">Sean Spicer was right out there and he</text>
  <text start="374.98" dur="3.84">debunked media reports that the Trump</text>
  <text start="376.99" dur="3.42">administration instructed the</text>
  <text start="378.82" dur="3.96">Environmental Protection Agency to</text>
  <text start="380.41" dur="4.98">remove the climate change page from its</text>
  <text start="382.78" dur="5.13">website no he said there is nothing that</text>
  <text start="385.39" dur="7.83">has come from the White House absolutely</text>
  <text start="387.91" dur="7.89">not that said this and just completely</text>
  <text start="393.22" dur="4.89">shut them down right off the bat now he</text>
  <text start="395.8" dur="3.36">did put it gag order on the department</text>
  <text start="398.11" dur="2.94">he doesn&amp;#39;t want people talking about</text>
  <text start="399.16" dur="7.04">certain things that are going on there</text>
  <text start="401.05" dur="8.16">and we can see that the EPA employees</text>
  <text start="406.2" dur="4.45">well they decided that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="409.21" dur="4.56">speak out because they don&amp;#39;t believe in</text>
  <text start="410.65" dur="6.57">censorship well your president who you</text>
  <text start="413.77" dur="5.01">work for is telling you listen I need my</text>
  <text start="417.22" dur="3.17">team to come in there we need to see</text>
  <text start="418.78" dur="4.11">what you&amp;#39;re working on I&amp;#39;m new here</text>
  <text start="420.39" dur="6.79">let&amp;#39;s not talk about what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="422.89" dur="7.79">just yet which makes sense and they</text>
  <text start="427.18" dur="7.64">decided to create rogue Twitter accounts</text>
  <text start="430.68" dur="6.55">so they can say what is going on fine</text>
  <text start="434.82" dur="4.96">but we can see right now there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="437.23" dur="4.65">of misinformation that is out there now</text>
  <text start="439.78" dur="4.86">I know Trump is out there any saying</text>
  <text start="441.88" dur="5.97">that you know Mexico is going to be</text>
  <text start="444.64" dur="4.02">paying for this wall now a lot of the</text>
  <text start="447.85" dur="4.08">wall</text>
  <text start="448.66" dur="5.4">is built I mean there&amp;#39;s fences and</text>
  <text start="451.93" dur="4.98">things like that it&amp;#39;s not all the same</text>
  <text start="454.06" dur="5.52">but it does run across California</text>
  <text start="456.91" dur="4.77">through Arizona and there&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="459.58" dur="4.2">portion in Texas which is pretty much</text>
  <text start="461.68" dur="4.65">has nothing but we can see right now</text>
  <text start="463.78" dur="5.04">that now he&amp;#39;s saying that the people</text>
  <text start="466.33" dur="4.79">must pay for it and then Mexico&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="468.82" dur="7.38">to reimburse but we can see Andrey que</text>
  <text start="471.12" dur="8.05">pena nieto he said absolutely not this</text>
  <text start="476.2" dur="5.79">is the president from Mexico saying we</text>
  <text start="479.17" dur="5.28">are not paying for the wall now the only</text>
  <text start="481.99" dur="4.56">way that Trump most likely can make them</text>
  <text start="484.45" dur="5.1">pay is maybe through the negotiation</text>
  <text start="486.55" dur="4.62">through NAFTA saying listen we&amp;#39;ll do</text>
  <text start="489.55" dur="3.96">this but you need to pay for the wall</text>
  <text start="491.17" dur="5.34">but we can see right now Mexico is</text>
  <text start="493.51" dur="5.52">saying we&amp;#39;re out of this so we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="496.51" dur="5.13">to have to see how this goes forward but</text>
  <text start="499.03" dur="3.96">I think Trump is trying to keep to his</text>
  <text start="501.64" dur="5.7">promise that he made on his campaign</text>
  <text start="502.99" dur="7.43">trail and at this point I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="507.34" dur="6.48">this is the most important issue we can</text>
  <text start="510.42" dur="5.89">set up surveillance in this area we can</text>
  <text start="513.82" dur="5.58">get rid of the memorandum that Obama had</text>
  <text start="516.31" dur="6.06">which he&amp;#39;s already going to do where</text>
  <text start="519.4" dur="5.01">illegals who jump over the border stay</text>
  <text start="522.37" dur="4.56">in the country just have the Border</text>
  <text start="524.41" dur="4.95">Patrol send them right back set up a lot</text>
  <text start="526.93" dur="3.93">more surveillance add more Border Patrol</text>
  <text start="529.36" dur="3.09">will be a little bit cheaper than the</text>
  <text start="530.86" dur="4.35">wall right now and we can get to the</text>
  <text start="532.45" dur="5.73">wall a little bit later because I</text>
  <text start="535.21" dur="5.7">believe that the economy I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="538.18" dur="4.35">it can handle the expense of a wall and</text>
  <text start="540.91" dur="4.83">the expense of everything else because</text>
  <text start="542.53" dur="6.09">things are rapidly falling apart now</text>
  <text start="545.74" dur="6.87">there is a top US Secret Service agent</text>
  <text start="548.62" dur="6.69">that is out there Kari O&amp;#39;Grady who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="552.61" dur="5.78">saying that she will not take a bullet</text>
  <text start="555.31" dur="6.24">for Trump she will not protect Trump and</text>
  <text start="558.39" dur="6.55">she doesn&amp;#39;t believe in this president</text>
  <text start="561.55" dur="4.65">what so ever and to that I think she</text>
  <text start="564.94" dur="4.65">needs she needs to be removed from</text>
  <text start="566.2" dur="7.05">Secret Service because she is a Secret</text>
  <text start="569.59" dur="6.78">Service agent and that is her duty she</text>
  <text start="573.25" dur="5.13">signed on to do this and of course she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="576.37" dur="4.02">saying the world is changing I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="578.38" dur="3.79">going along with this so you know what</text>
  <text start="580.39" dur="3.43">get rid of her get</text>
  <text start="582.17" dur="4.76">someone who will protect Trump and</text>
  <text start="583.82" dur="7.59">that&amp;#39;s why Trump decided to hire his own</text>
  <text start="586.93" dur="6.61">personal security staff on Monday</text>
  <text start="591.41" dur="5.429">president Trump selected Ajit Pai to</text>
  <text start="593.54" dur="6.95">head up the FCC and the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="596.839" dur="6.271">is going completely crazy over this</text>
  <text start="600.49" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;re saying that pi want to destroy</text>
  <text start="603.11" dur="6.539">net neutrality is an obstructionist is</text>
  <text start="606.67" dur="6.159">critical of basic privacy online and</text>
  <text start="609.649" dur="5.151">plans to dismantle net neutrality well</text>
  <text start="612.829" dur="4.831">nothing could be further from the truth</text>
  <text start="614.8" dur="5.14">to fully understand what pi stance on</text>
  <text start="617.66" dur="4.47">net neutrality actually is we need to</text>
  <text start="619.94" dur="5.55">clear up the confusion that has been</text>
  <text start="622.13" dur="4.86">surrounding the term for years there is</text>
  <text start="625.49" dur="2.88">net neutrality and then there&amp;#39;s net</text>
  <text start="626.99" dur="4.589">neutrality there&amp;#39;s Obama&amp;#39;s net</text>
  <text start="628.37" dur="5.159">neutrality the elite net neutrality and</text>
  <text start="631.579" dur="4.56">then there&amp;#39;s real net neutrality net</text>
  <text start="633.529" dur="5.691">neutrality is it&amp;#39;s an open free internet</text>
  <text start="636.139" dur="8.82">nobody controls it plain and simple</text>
  <text start="639.22" dur="10.239">Obama&amp;#39;s net neutrality is having the FCC</text>
  <text start="644.959" dur="7.921">control it regulated placing it under</text>
  <text start="649.459" dur="6.06">title 2 which was included in his</text>
  <text start="652.88" dur="8.85">version of net neutrality where it would</text>
  <text start="655.519" dur="10.051">allow the FCC to take the internet and</text>
  <text start="661.73" dur="6.69">consider it a utility like water and</text>
  <text start="665.57" dur="5.1">electric now what are an electric they</text>
  <text start="668.42" dur="5.7">really don&amp;#39;t change over time but the</text>
  <text start="670.67" dur="6.3">internet does it gets faster the</text>
  <text start="674.12" dur="7.26">technology is improved so it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="676.97" dur="12.479">not a utility and what Obama wanted to</text>
  <text start="681.38" dur="11.699">do was tax have companies pay for faster</text>
  <text start="689.449" dur="11.101">areas so they can get their information</text>
  <text start="693.079" dur="11.391">and all this was about control taxing</text>
  <text start="700.55" dur="7.8">and limiting free speech on the Internet</text>
  <text start="704.47" dur="6.28">what does pi want to do well he wants to</text>
  <text start="708.35" dur="5.01">get rid of all that he says that we</text>
  <text start="710.75" dur="4.23">shouldn&amp;#39;t be touching it there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="713.36" dur="4.86">reason to touch it</text>
  <text start="714.98" dur="7.38">it&amp;#39;s not broken the internet works fine</text>
  <text start="718.22" dur="6.96">and we can see right now that it is fine</text>
  <text start="722.36" dur="4.8">so what&amp;#39;s happening why is the corporate</text>
  <text start="725.18" dur="4.61">media the establishment the elite why</text>
  <text start="727.16" dur="6.03">are they so angry because Trump is</text>
  <text start="729.79" dur="6.489">undoing everything they worked on all</text>
  <text start="733.19" dur="6.93">this time and they don&amp;#39;t like it they</text>
  <text start="736.279" dur="5.401">don&amp;#39;t know how to stop it because they</text>
  <text start="740.12" dur="4.32">were thinking oh this is a great way to</text>
  <text start="741.68" dur="4.74">control the Internet companies are going</text>
  <text start="744.44" dur="4.32">to pay we&amp;#39;re going to tax people and</text>
  <text start="746.42" dur="4.38">things are going to be great and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="748.76" dur="5.55">going to convince everyone this is net</text>
  <text start="750.8" dur="5.899">neutrality but we can see right now it</text>
  <text start="754.31" dur="6.3">isn&amp;#39;t and now they&amp;#39;re getting nervous</text>
  <text start="756.699" dur="8.741">now Trump was interviewed on ABC and</text>
  <text start="760.61" dur="8.219">they were talking about torture and I</text>
  <text start="765.44" dur="5.04">noticed after the interview or right</text>
  <text start="768.829" dur="3.891">before the interview they had that</text>
  <text start="770.48" dur="5.099">document come out saying oh Trump is</text>
  <text start="772.72" dur="4.6">going ahead with CIA black sites and</text>
  <text start="775.579" dur="3.031">actually they&amp;#39;re recognizing that there</text>
  <text start="777.32" dur="2.4">were CIA black sites I remember there</text>
  <text start="778.61" dur="3.33">was a period of time where they said no</text>
  <text start="779.72" dur="4.679">there&amp;#39;s no such thing and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="781.94" dur="4.889">saying yes he&amp;#39;s going to reopen them so</text>
  <text start="784.399" dur="7.531">we can see right now that they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="786.829" dur="8.31">to play on his words now he was asked if</text>
  <text start="791.93" dur="5.04">he agrees with torture this is some</text>
  <text start="795.139" dur="5.281">place where this is an area which I</text>
  <text start="796.97" dur="5.989">completely disagree he says that he has</text>
  <text start="800.42" dur="5.789">reports that waterboarding and torture</text>
  <text start="802.959" dur="6.281">absolutely work well we can show other</text>
  <text start="806.209" dur="6.36">research which shows that torture does</text>
  <text start="809.24" dur="6.349">not work and he has general mattis and</text>
  <text start="812.569" dur="6.661">he has pompeo who was head of the CIA</text>
  <text start="815.589" dur="6.25">maddis doesn&amp;#39;t believe in torture pompeo</text>
  <text start="819.23" dur="6">does he did say he was going to leave it</text>
  <text start="821.839" dur="9.18">up to them to decide but he does believe</text>
  <text start="825.23" dur="8.31">in torture he believes it works and at</text>
  <text start="831.019" dur="7.161">this point this is where I completely</text>
  <text start="833.54" dur="9.59">disagree because in his speech during</text>
  <text start="838.18" dur="6.029">his address to the nation he said</text>
  <text start="843.13" dur="7.17">America</text>
  <text start="844.209" dur="8.61">should shine torturing an individual who</text>
  <text start="850.3" dur="4.769">has not been convicted of a crime and I</text>
  <text start="852.819" dur="5.971">don&amp;#39;t care if they&amp;#39;re American citizen</text>
  <text start="855.069" dur="7.56">they&amp;#39;re a foreign citizen you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="858.79" dur="6.419">if they really did what they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="862.629" dur="7.921">charged of because they haven&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="865.209" dur="8.49">convicted and for America to shine we</text>
  <text start="870.55" dur="7.019">can&amp;#39;t stoop to the level of not giving</text>
  <text start="873.699" dur="6.51">due process and of course they bypass to</text>
  <text start="877.569" dur="7.02">a process by setting up these sites</text>
  <text start="880.209" dur="5.521">across the world because it&amp;#39;s outside</text>
  <text start="884.589" dur="2.821">the United States because if it was</text>
  <text start="885.73" dur="4.469">inside the United States this would be</text>
  <text start="887.41" dur="5.76">against the law but this is an example</text>
  <text start="890.199" dur="5.58">to the rest of the world we should be</text>
  <text start="893.17" dur="6.479">above this we should give these</text>
  <text start="895.779" dur="6.36">individuals due process we should allow</text>
  <text start="899.649" dur="6.3">them to defend themselves of what</text>
  <text start="902.139" dur="5.281">they&amp;#39;re being charged for I mean think</text>
  <text start="905.949" dur="2.971">about what&amp;#39;s happening here and</text>
  <text start="907.42" dur="4.379">everyone&amp;#39;s well there&amp;#39;s terror there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="908.92" dur="6.589">this yes there there is but we also have</text>
  <text start="911.799" dur="6.78">to look at who&amp;#39;s creating this terror is</text>
  <text start="915.509" dur="7.901">it true terror or is it terror created</text>
  <text start="918.579" dur="8.7">by the CIA and for us to shine we need</text>
  <text start="923.41" dur="7.109">to be better than this we need to extend</text>
  <text start="927.279" dur="6.78">the rights that we have two individuals</text>
  <text start="930.519" dur="6.03">especially if the u.s. is saying that</text>
  <text start="934.059" dur="6.33">well we think you committed terror on</text>
  <text start="936.549" dur="9">the US they need to go to trial now in</text>
  <text start="940.389" dur="7.92">Syria we see turkey has now designated</text>
  <text start="945.549" dur="6.39">the Islamic state the mystery front and</text>
  <text start="948.309" dur="6.661">al-sham as terrorist groups along with</text>
  <text start="951.939" dur="4.95">what Russia has been saying all along so</text>
  <text start="954.97" dur="5.549">we can see that Turkey and Russia they</text>
  <text start="956.889" dur="5.25">had been working together and it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="960.519" dur="4.831">mean that our wands a good guy he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="962.139" dur="5.64">still at a dictator but he is doing</text>
  <text start="965.35" dur="6.39">whatever Putin says and he&amp;#39;s following</text>
  <text start="967.779" dur="5.85">along right now with his orders we see</text>
  <text start="971.74" dur="4.16">that Isis defenses they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="973.629" dur="4.911">collapsing the North Aleppo</text>
  <text start="975.9" dur="4.89">it seems like Isis is on the run right</text>
  <text start="978.54" dur="4.8">now and it&amp;#39;s just getting worse and</text>
  <text start="980.79" dur="5.18">worse for the paid mercenaries in this</text>
  <text start="983.34" dur="5.22">entire area congresswoman tulsi gabbard</text>
  <text start="985.97" dur="6.09">well she returns from Syria with renewed</text>
  <text start="988.56" dur="7.26">calls to end what is happening in Syria</text>

  <text start="1015.05" dur="8.42">upon her return my visit to Syria has</text>
  <text start="1021.08" dur="5.67">made it abundantly clear our</text>
  <text start="1023.47" dur="6.43">counterproductive regime change war does</text>
  <text start="1026.75" dur="5.339">not serve America&amp;#39;s interests and it</text>
  <text start="1029.9" dur="5.13">certainly isn&amp;#39;t in the interest of the</text>
  <text start="1032.089" dur="6.591">Syrian people as I visited with people</text>
  <text start="1035.03" dur="6.059">from across the country and heard</text>
  <text start="1038.68" dur="4.84">heartbreaking stories of how this war</text>
  <text start="1041.089" dur="5.241">was devastating their lives I was asked</text>
  <text start="1043.52" dur="5.67">why is the United States and its allies</text>
  <text start="1046.33" dur="7.15">helping al Qaeda and other terrorist</text>
  <text start="1049.19" dur="6.63">groups to try to take over Syria Syria</text>
  <text start="1053.48" dur="4.97">did not attack the United States al</text>
  <text start="1055.82" dur="6.63">Qaeda did well not too sure about that</text>
  <text start="1058.45" dur="6.82">she said I had no answer I returned to</text>
  <text start="1062.45" dur="5.28">Washington she says with even greater</text>
  <text start="1065.27" dur="4.98">resolve to end our illegal war to</text>
  <text start="1067.73" dur="3.75">overthrow the Syrian government I call</text>
  <text start="1070.25" dur="3.9">upon Congress and the new administration</text>
  <text start="1071.48" dur="7.11">to answer the pleas of the Syrian people</text>
  <text start="1074.15" dur="9.06">immediately and support the stop arming</text>
  <text start="1078.59" dur="7.5">terrace act so we can see right now she</text>
  <text start="1083.21" dur="4.83">saw firsthand that the u.s. does support</text>
  <text start="1086.09" dur="5.91">the terrace that these paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="1088.04" dur="5.55">are trying to overthrow Assad now the</text>
  <text start="1092" dur="3.48">corporate media is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="1093.59" dur="5.28">there&amp;#39;s a draft executive order that</text>
  <text start="1095.48" dur="6.54">Trump is expected to sign regarding his</text>
  <text start="1098.87" dur="7.58">plan to suspend the US refugee program</text>
  <text start="1102.02" dur="6.46">and tighten the procedures for vetting</text>
  <text start="1106.45" dur="4.58">however they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1108.48" dur="7.439">tucked away and hidden in the document</text>
  <text start="1111.03" dur="8.07">is something about safe zones in Syria</text>
  <text start="1115.919" dur="6.691">and this is according to Reuters and</text>
  <text start="1119.1" dur="7.68">Newsweek saying that he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1122.61" dur="6.689">create safe zones in Syria now this has</text>
  <text start="1126.78" dur="6">been the plan of the elites since the</text>
  <text start="1129.299" dur="6.151">beginning this is what they really</text>
  <text start="1132.78" dur="6.6">wanted to do and I find it very</text>
  <text start="1135.45" dur="6.39">interesting for Trump to hide this in an</text>
  <text start="1139.38" dur="5.1">executive order it makes no sense at</text>
  <text start="1141.84" dur="4.74">this point because he campaigned on not</text>
  <text start="1144.48" dur="4.199">getting involved in the Middle East and</text>
  <text start="1146.58" dur="5.55">he&amp;#39;s a little confused right now about</text>
  <text start="1148.679" dur="5.791">the Islamic state and terrorism I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1152.13" dur="5.16">think he fully understands that the</text>
  <text start="1154.47" dur="9.12">United States pays for them supports</text>
  <text start="1157.29" dur="9.66">them and uses them for regime change and</text>
  <text start="1163.59" dur="6.24">once he starts to realize that this is</text>
  <text start="1166.95" dur="5.58">the case well he&amp;#39;s going to have a huge</text>
  <text start="1169.83" dur="4.469">problem on his hand because things that</text>
  <text start="1172.53" dur="5.37">he&amp;#39;s doing right now he&amp;#39;s going to have</text>
  <text start="1174.299" dur="5.25">to reverse and hopefully somebody tells</text>
  <text start="1177.9" dur="3.33">him what&amp;#39;s really going on but we can</text>
  <text start="1179.549" dur="5.071">see there&amp;#39;s other voices there there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1181.23" dur="5.64">other forces at play in this area where</text>
  <text start="1184.62" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re pushing him in one direction and</text>
  <text start="1186.87" dur="4.47">other forces are pushing it in a</text>
  <text start="1189.48" dur="5.18">different direction so what he&amp;#39;s hearing</text>
  <text start="1191.34" dur="6.12">is most likely many different things and</text>
  <text start="1194.66" dur="4.87">we can see right now that eventually</text>
  <text start="1197.46" dur="4.349">hopefully he&amp;#39;ll find out the truth</text>
  <text start="1199.53" dur="4.68">because otherwise those in power those</text>
  <text start="1201.809" dur="3.541">hiding behind the curtain well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1204.21" dur="4.05">going to try to push him in a certain</text>
  <text start="1205.35" dur="5.699">direction and that direction most likely</text>
  <text start="1208.26" dur="5.76">will be war we see the Islamic state has</text>
  <text start="1211.049" dur="5.13">put out a new video showing that they</text>
  <text start="1214.02" dur="3.899">have this weaponized drone program and</text>
  <text start="1216.179" dur="3.451">it looks like it&amp;#39;s a complete another</text>
  <text start="1217.919" dur="5.371">fake it looks like a lot of its CGI</text>
  <text start="1219.63" dur="5.61">looks like very Hollywood and you know</text>
  <text start="1223.29" dur="5.16">they have it with music and everything</text>
  <text start="1225.24" dur="6.36">like that and once again it looks like</text>
  <text start="1228.45" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re pushing this out to the public</text>
  <text start="1231.6" dur="4.47">to make everyone afraid of the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1233.76" dur="4.26">state which again you have to remember</text>
  <text start="1236.07" dur="6">what the elite are doing they&amp;#39;re playing</text>
  <text start="1238.02" dur="7.08">on Trump right now they&amp;#39;re playing on</text>
  <text start="1242.07" dur="5.79">emotion they&amp;#39;re playing on what he knows</text>
  <text start="1245.1" dur="4.56">because they&amp;#39;re trying to push him into</text>
  <text start="1247.86" dur="3.12">a conflict with China so they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1249.66" dur="3.3">to play on that they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="1250.98" dur="4.17">push him on a conflict with Iran they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1252.96" dur="4.26">playing on that and he&amp;#39;s come out and</text>
  <text start="1255.15" dur="4.05">said he&amp;#39;s completely against the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1257.22" dur="4.59">state and they&amp;#39;re trying to push him in</text>
  <text start="1259.2" dur="4.62">that direction also so we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1261.81" dur="4.59">have to see how this all plays out now</text>
  <text start="1263.82" dur="5.25">for the first time in 64 years the</text>

  <text start="1274.95" dur="7.35">the world now is closer to a catastrophe</text>
  <text start="1278.28" dur="7.92">actually an apocalypse why due to</text>
  <text start="1282.3" dur="8.21">threats of nuclear weapons climate</text>
  <text start="1286.2" dur="7.83">change and Donald Trump&amp;#39;s election yes</text>

  <text start="1297.39" dur="6.8">seconds to midnight from three minutes</text>
  <text start="1299.85" dur="9.18">and we haven&amp;#39;t seen anything like this</text>
  <text start="1304.19" dur="7.48">since nineteen fifty-three the last time</text>
  <text start="1309.03" dur="5.85">that it was this close was at that</text>
