  <text start="57.46" dur="7.11">this episode 1348 bien today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.51" dur="5.22">August 3rd 2017 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="64.57" dur="5.97">episode is that deep state strikes back</text>
  <text start="66.73" dur="5.97">pushing everything to the edge let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="70.54" dur="5.04">into the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="72.7" dur="6.24">geopolitical news now we can see that</text>
  <text start="75.58" dur="5.37">the deep state they&amp;#39;re striking back and</text>
  <text start="78.94" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re pushing everything to the edge</text>
  <text start="80.95" dur="3.68">and the reason I say that is you can see</text>
  <text start="83.32" dur="5.88">what is happening right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="84.63" dur="7.33">going full throttle to remove Trump or</text>
  <text start="89.2" dur="5.7">to make it look like he was part of this</text>
  <text start="91.96" dur="5.25">Russian collusion conspiracy theory that</text>
  <text start="94.9" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re putting forth and we see that</text>
  <text start="97.21" dur="4.53">the Washington Post they published two</text>
  <text start="99.16" dur="4.68">transcripts of Donald Trump with his</text>
  <text start="101.74" dur="4.62">conversations with the Mexican President</text>
  <text start="103.84" dur="4.44">the Australian Prime Minister and they</text>
  <text start="106.36" dur="4.14">released the transcripts and of course</text>
  <text start="108.28" dur="4.38">this was another leak and we see other</text>
  <text start="110.5" dur="4.89">leaks that are coming out from his</text>
  <text start="112.66" dur="4.89">office area and we see that they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="115.39" dur="5.4">going to keep leaking like crazy because</text>
  <text start="117.55" dur="6.54">they realize their time is almost up</text>
  <text start="120.79" dur="6.06">here and they are very nervous now</text>
  <text start="124.09" dur="5.61">Seymour Hersh came out and he broke this</text>
  <text start="126.85" dur="4.95">whole Russia Gate thing wide open he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="129.7" dur="5.1">saying that this is a CIA planted lie</text>
  <text start="131.8" dur="6.03">it&amp;#39;s a Brennan operation and we knew</text>
  <text start="134.8" dur="5.37">this from the very beginning we knew</text>
  <text start="137.83" dur="4.59">that the intelligence agencies the deep</text>
  <text start="140.17" dur="4.41">state individuals who wanted to maintain</text>
  <text start="142.42" dur="4.26">control we knew that they were</text>
  <text start="144.58" dur="5.85">controlling all of this and they were</text>
  <text start="146.68" dur="7.41">creating this entire narrative for the</text>
  <text start="150.43" dur="5.97">entire country to believe they use the</text>
  <text start="154.09" dur="5.88">press which is their mouthpiece to push</text>
  <text start="156.4" dur="10.14">this through and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="159.97" dur="9.57">they want Mueller to dig deep produce</text>
  <text start="166.54" dur="5.669">whatever he has to produce to get Trump</text>
  <text start="169.54" dur="6.33">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="172.209" dur="6.571">there are two bills that were introduced</text>
  <text start="175.87" dur="4.8">to protect Special Counsel Robert</text>
  <text start="178.78" dur="5.25">Mueller now we know he has a lot of</text>
  <text start="180.67" dur="5.27">connections to the Clinton side and Bill</text>
  <text start="184.03" dur="3.32">one well that ensures</text>
  <text start="185.94" dur="4.47">special counsel cannot be removed</text>
  <text start="187.35" dur="6.66">improperly and is critical to the</text>
  <text start="190.41" dur="8.46">integrity of the investigation bill 2 is</text>
  <text start="194.01" dur="8.61">a little different if he was fired well</text>
  <text start="198.87" dur="6.23">then it could be challenged so the</text>
  <text start="202.62" dur="6.12">difference is Tillis Coons bill is</text>
  <text start="205.1" dur="5.38">reactive once the firing has taken place</text>
  <text start="208.74" dur="4.86">it could be challenged whereas the</text>
  <text start="210.48" dur="5.19">Graham Booker bill is pre-emptive where</text>
  <text start="213.6" dur="4.77">it ensures that the special counsel</text>
  <text start="215.67" dur="4.83">cannot be removed improperly so we have</text>
  <text start="218.37" dur="2.76">these two bills so no matter what</text>
  <text start="220.5" dur="4.68">happens</text>
  <text start="221.13" dur="6.48">Mueller is covered Mueller is bringing</text>
  <text start="225.18" dur="5.88">together the grand jury in this Russian</text>
  <text start="227.61" dur="6.08">probe he&amp;#39;s issuing subpoenas right now</text>
  <text start="231.06" dur="6.12">like he&amp;#39;s painting the Russian lawyer</text>
  <text start="233.69" dur="6.13">Donald Trump jr. and many others because</text>
  <text start="237.18" dur="6.78">he&amp;#39;s going ahead with all of this</text>
  <text start="239.82" dur="7.32">because there&amp;#39;s no time left the deep</text>
  <text start="243.96" dur="4.95">state is in trouble and they notice</text>
  <text start="247.14" dur="2.42">everything in the Middle East is coming</text>
  <text start="248.91" dur="3.36">to an end</text>
  <text start="249.56" dur="4.87">North Korea is really not going anywhere</text>
  <text start="252.27" dur="5.04">and they&amp;#39;re trying to do whatever they</text>
  <text start="254.43" dur="4.44">possibly can to basically take control</text>
  <text start="257.31" dur="5.54">of the situation</text>
  <text start="258.87" dur="7.26">McMasters is out there and he has sacked</text>
  <text start="262.85" dur="6.58">fired another member of the National</text>
  <text start="266.13" dur="6.12">Security Council now this was Ezra Cohen</text>
  <text start="269.43" dur="4.89">watt Nick he was removed from his</text>
  <text start="272.25" dur="5.46">position he&amp;#39;s a director of the</text>
  <text start="274.32" dur="5.7">intelligence programs and McMasters had</text>
  <text start="277.71" dur="5.15">a problem with Cohen watt Nick for a</text>
  <text start="280.02" dur="6.18">while but Trump basically stopped him</text>
  <text start="282.86" dur="5.08">from firing him before because he was</text>
  <text start="286.2" dur="4.23">close with Steve Bannon but it looks</text>
  <text start="287.94" dur="3.83">like McMasters well he just went out and</text>
  <text start="290.43" dur="3.93">did it because what he&amp;#39;s trying to do is</text>
  <text start="291.77" dur="4.51">anyone that is with Trump anyone is</text>
  <text start="294.36" dur="4.46">working with Trump they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="296.28" dur="5.94">remove they&amp;#39;re trying to get him</text>
  <text start="298.82" dur="5.68">separated from everyone else and this</text>
  <text start="302.22" dur="4.49">way they can try to remove him very</text>
  <text start="304.5" dur="5.31">easily this is the deep states plan</text>
  <text start="306.71" dur="4.81">because they see what is happening right</text>
  <text start="309.81" dur="4.109">now think about what has happened since</text>
  <text start="311.52" dur="4.92">he came into office got rid of the TPP</text>
  <text start="313.919" dur="5.561">trying to repeal Obamacare yes it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="316.44" dur="5.29">going well actually stopped funding the</text>
  <text start="319.48" dur="3.99">hundred rebels out in Syria hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="321.73" dur="5.91">really done anything with North Korea</text>
  <text start="323.47" dur="6.54">and we see right now that all their</text>
  <text start="327.64" dur="4.11">plans in the Middle East in Libya he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="330.01" dur="3.93">not doing anything he&amp;#39;s not sending</text>
  <text start="331.75" dur="4.17">troops to Afghanistan he wants to</text>
  <text start="333.94" dur="5.07">investigate what has been going on in</text>
  <text start="335.92" dur="6.33">Afghanistan and we see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="339.01" dur="5.7">getting very very worried about all of</text>
  <text start="342.25" dur="5.16">this now there&amp;#39;s a report that has come</text>
  <text start="344.71" dur="5.16">out that says that the Pentagon has</text>
  <text start="347.41" dur="4.44">wasted about 450 million in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="349.87" dur="4.11">now we know Afghanistan is not about the</text>
  <text start="351.85" dur="4.35">war this is about the poppy field about</text>
  <text start="353.98" dur="6.06">all the minerals being in a strategic</text>
  <text start="356.2" dur="7.29">location and this report came out and it</text>
  <text start="360.04" dur="6.21">showed that nearly half a billion of</text>
  <text start="363.49" dur="5.04">American taxpayer funds they were wasted</text>
  <text start="366.25" dur="3.56">by contractors hired by the United</text>
  <text start="368.53" dur="4.2">States government to train Afghan</text>
  <text start="369.81" dur="5.41">intelligence personnel now according to</text>
  <text start="372.73" dur="4.92">this report by a congressional body the</text>
  <text start="375.22" dur="4.8">funds were spent between 2010 and 2013</text>
  <text start="377.65" dur="4.32">by the US Department of Defense and this</text>
  <text start="380.02" dur="3.69">was to train you know a few dozen</text>
  <text start="381.97" dur="4.44">members of the Afghan national defense</text>
  <text start="383.71" dur="5.79">security forces now two companies legacy</text>
  <text start="386.41" dur="5.7">Afghanistan R&amp;amp;D and Afghanistan source</text>
  <text start="389.5" dur="4.55">operations management oversaw the</text>
  <text start="392.11" dur="4.83">training program it was primarily</text>
  <text start="394.05" dur="5.62">executed by a contractor in paradis</text>
  <text start="396.94" dur="5.31">Corporation and subcontractor nucentra</text>
  <text start="399.67" dur="6.11">consulting and that was a total cost of</text>
  <text start="402.25" dur="5.94">about 457 million and guess what</text>
  <text start="405.78" dur="6.58">according to this new report the 4-year</text>
  <text start="408.19" dur="8.48">program was a monumental multi</text>
  <text start="412.36" dur="7.23">multi-million dollar complete waste and</text>
  <text start="416.67" dur="4.65">this report was written by the Special</text>
  <text start="419.59" dur="6.18">Inspector General for Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="421.32" dur="7.75">restructuring cigar and we can see that</text>
  <text start="425.77" dur="5.79">all this money that was flowing out to</text>
  <text start="429.07" dur="5.58">Afghanistan and I&amp;#39;m saying we&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="431.56" dur="7.08">trillions already where did it all go</text>
  <text start="434.65" dur="7.14">and this is where they have the problem</text>
  <text start="438.64" dur="5.58">they can&amp;#39;t account for any of this money</text>
  <text start="441.79" dur="4.74">and we know where it went</text>
  <text start="444.22" dur="5.04">it went into their pockets and went into</text>
  <text start="446.53" dur="4.98">different areas it was funneled into</text>
  <text start="449.26" dur="3.779">different places it was used for covert</text>
  <text start="451.51" dur="4.529">operations</text>
  <text start="453.039" dur="5.46">now out in the Philippines do-dirty it</text>
  <text start="456.039" dur="5.19">looks like he wants 30,000 more troops</text>
  <text start="458.499" dur="5.431">to go after the Islamic state 20,000</text>
  <text start="461.229" dur="4.17">soldiers 10,000 police and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="463.93" dur="4.37">he&amp;#39;s ready to clean up the whole area</text>
  <text start="465.399" dur="6.901">it&amp;#39;s almost time to wipe these</text>
  <text start="468.3" dur="5.949">terrorists out and we can see that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="472.3" dur="4.56">not holding back he&amp;#39;s going after the</text>
  <text start="474.249" dur="4.681">CIA drug cartel he&amp;#39;s going after the</text>
  <text start="476.86" dur="4.41">terrorist groups that the CIA sent in</text>
  <text start="478.93" dur="4.65">there and he&amp;#39;s not wasting any time he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="481.27" dur="4.289">building up his troops saying no you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="483.58" dur="3.929">not going to do what you did to every</text>
  <text start="485.559" dur="4.95">single other country we&amp;#39;re going to get</text>
  <text start="487.509" dur="4.74">rid of you before this even happens now</text>
  <text start="490.509" dur="4.261">the deep state they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="492.249" dur="3.871">trying to create hot spots all over the</text>
  <text start="494.77" dur="3.679">place we know North Korea is one of them</text>
  <text start="496.12" dur="5.189">Syria&amp;#39;s another they&amp;#39;re going to push</text>
  <text start="498.449" dur="6.161">their agenda out in Ukraine and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="501.309" dur="6.36">already seeing that according to certain</text>
  <text start="504.61" dur="5.849">reconnaissance data that the contact</text>
  <text start="507.669" dur="6.271">line the Ukrainian forces they are now</text>
  <text start="510.459" dur="5.18">bringing weapons up to this area on a</text>
  <text start="513.94" dur="5.009">dozens of self-propelled artillery</text>
  <text start="515.639" dur="6.07">platforms howitzers tanks they are on</text>
  <text start="518.949" dur="6.45">the frontline now this might mean</text>
  <text start="521.709" dur="6.211">nothing but once again as the deep state</text>
  <text start="525.399" dur="4.951">continually loses its grip in all these</text>
  <text start="527.92" dur="5.279">areas they&amp;#39;re going to be pushing as</text>
  <text start="530.35" dur="5.31">hard as they possibly can now we know</text>
  <text start="533.199" dur="5.281">that trumps signed the sanctions bill</text>
  <text start="535.66" dur="4.95">really he had no choice because even if</text>
  <text start="538.48" dur="4.799">he vetoed it it would have made of any</text>
  <text start="540.61" dur="5.039">you know any better it still would have</text>
  <text start="543.279" dur="5.37">gone through and it showed that now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="545.649" dur="5.701">really the enemy of all the individuals</text>
  <text start="548.649" dur="4.651">in Congress and I think he did this on</text>
  <text start="551.35" dur="3">purpose it was a strategic move we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="553.3" dur="3.14">going to discuss this in a little bit</text>
  <text start="554.35" dur="4.14">but he did come out and say listen</text>
  <text start="556.44" dur="5.019">relations between the US and Russia</text>
  <text start="558.49" dur="7.8">aren&amp;#39;t at all time and very dangerous</text>
  <text start="561.459" dur="8.36">low he wanted to thank Congress and also</text>
  <text start="566.29" dur="6.84">blame Congress for this turn of events</text>
  <text start="569.819" dur="5.741">because he understands what is happening</text>
  <text start="573.13" dur="4.23">he understands that they just pushed</text>
  <text start="575.56" dur="4.019">through this sanctions bill that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="577.36" dur="4.709">to hurt corporations hurt Europe and</text>
  <text start="579.579" dur="6.301">what does it actually really do does it</text>
  <text start="582.069" dur="4.531">help the US no it brings Europe and</text>
  <text start="585.88" dur="3.36">Russia close</text>

  <text start="589.24" dur="6.269">with Russia it brings North Korea closer</text>
  <text start="591.88" dur="7.11">together with Russia what the Congress</text>
  <text start="595.509" dur="5.7">has done right now is I don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="598.99" dur="4.17">the outcome that they really wanted I</text>
  <text start="601.209" dur="3.69">think in their minds they think this is</text>
  <text start="603.16" dur="4.799">going to really put the screws to Russia</text>
  <text start="604.899" dur="6.511">but it really isn&amp;#39;t now McCain he fired</text>

  <text start="708.939" dur="5.25">through it and what he&amp;#39;s doing right now</text>
  <text start="710.889" dur="6.841">is he&amp;#39;s setting up a presidential</text>
  <text start="714.189" dur="5.83">statement in which he will then take</text>
  <text start="717.73" dur="5.649">what he signed</text>
  <text start="720.019" dur="6.031">and it looks like he&amp;#39;s preparing to take</text>
  <text start="723.379" dur="5.041">this to the Supreme Court and challenge</text>
  <text start="726.05" dur="4.86">it he might do this later in the future</text>
  <text start="728.42" dur="4.709">but it looks like this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="730.91" dur="5.07">preparing and actually this was one of</text>
  <text start="733.129" dur="4.44">the options that we discussed so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="735.98" dur="5.039">going to have to watch out for that and</text>
  <text start="737.569" dur="6.27">see how he moves with this and we could</text>
  <text start="741.019" dur="4.8">see at this point that if he vetoed it I</text>
  <text start="743.839" dur="4.021">don&amp;#39;t know how he would be able to move</text>
  <text start="745.819" dur="4.651">with this maneuver this this way he</text>
  <text start="747.86" dur="4.289">could say okay let&amp;#39;s sign this let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="750.47" dur="2.63">take a look at this let&amp;#39;s look through</text>
  <text start="752.149" dur="3.78">it all right this is not</text>
  <text start="753.1" dur="4.989">unconstitutional this doesn&amp;#39;t fit or it</text>
  <text start="755.929" dur="3.541">encroaches on the executive power this</text>
  <text start="758.089" dur="3.78">part we have to bring to the Supreme</text>
  <text start="759.47" dur="5.579">Court actually I think he set this up</text>
  <text start="761.869" dur="5.611">where she can take this and maybe not</text>
  <text start="765.049" dur="4.53">follow through on a lot of it and I</text>
  <text start="767.48" dur="4.589">think that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s actually going to</text>
  <text start="769.579" dur="4.35">do now Russia is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="772.069" dur="4.32">saying that these sanctions they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="773.929" dur="4.741">going to stop the Russian pipeline and</text>
  <text start="776.389" dur="8.101">this is a project which is going to</text>
  <text start="778.67" dur="8.37">bring gas and oil into Europe and we can</text>
  <text start="784.49" dur="6.599">see that this was really the main focus</text>
  <text start="787.04" dur="6.93">of these sanctions they&amp;#39;re trying to put</text>
  <text start="791.089" dur="5.881">the screws to Russia make them stop this</text>
  <text start="793.97" dur="5.429">gas pipeline that is coming into Europe</text>
  <text start="796.97" dur="4.079">and you know Germany&amp;#39;s apart and many</text>
  <text start="799.399" dur="4.021">other European countries are part of it</text>
  <text start="801.049" dur="4.441">they&amp;#39;re trying to stop this because what</text>
  <text start="803.42" dur="6.479">they really wanted was the u.s. to</text>
  <text start="805.49" dur="5.61">supply the energy to Europe and Europe</text>
  <text start="809.899" dur="4.44">is already respond as United States</text>
  <text start="811.1" dur="7.5">listen we will decide where we get our</text>
  <text start="814.339" dur="8.401">energy now Russia is scaling down its</text>
  <text start="818.6" dur="7.56">gas transit in Ukraine because as we</text>
  <text start="822.74" dur="6.329">know one of the agendas in Ukraine was</text>
  <text start="826.16" dur="4.919">to take control of the gas pipeline</text>
  <text start="829.069" dur="4.89">coming from Russia that flowed through</text>
  <text start="831.079" dur="5.31">Ukraine into Europe to take control of</text>
  <text start="833.959" dur="5.19">those companies this is why Biden came</text>
  <text start="836.389" dur="6.24">in put his son on the chairman but among</text>
  <text start="839.149" dur="6.99">the on the Board of Directors this is</text>
  <text start="842.629" dur="6.031">why John Kerry had his roommate also on</text>
  <text start="846.139" dur="5.49">the board of directors this is one of</text>
  <text start="848.66" dur="4.85">the agendas that they were using to</text>
  <text start="851.629" dur="4.941">control</text>
  <text start="853.51" dur="6.42">flow of oil and gas going into Europe</text>
  <text start="856.57" dur="5.85">now Russia they are cutting off or</text>
  <text start="859.93" dur="5.279">shutting off the valves and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="862.42" dur="6.45">limiting the gas transit to Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="865.209" dur="7.5">this is a problem for these individuals</text>
  <text start="868.87" dur="5.82">that were hoping to maintain control of</text>
  <text start="872.709" dur="4.921">this and they&amp;#39;re going to bypass a lot</text>
  <text start="874.69" dur="4.769">of this and we see already that the we</text>
  <text start="877.63" dur="3.99">have the Turkish pipeline that is going</text>
  <text start="879.459" dur="3.841">to be coming into Turkey we also have</text>
  <text start="881.62" dur="4.86">the Iranian pipeline that&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="883.3" dur="4.95">coming through Iraq into Syria up into</text>
  <text start="886.48" dur="3.69">Europe and we can see that the deep</text>
  <text start="888.25" dur="6.36">state they&amp;#39;re completely being left out</text>
  <text start="890.17" dur="5.909">of this now out in Syria we see that the</text>
  <text start="894.61" dur="3.659">terrorist groups they are in big trouble</text>
  <text start="896.079" dur="4.801">right now the al Qaeda leader and I see</text>
  <text start="898.269" dur="5.19">stories all over the place that how al</text>
  <text start="900.88" dur="4.709">Qaeda is now ramping up and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="903.459" dur="4.68">taking different parts they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="905.589" dur="5.671">do whatever they possibly can to retake</text>
  <text start="908.139" dur="5.461">control and retake the narrative of what</text>
  <text start="911.26" dur="4.439">is happening in Syria and one of the al</text>
  <text start="913.6" dur="5.01">Qaeda leaders are saying listen we need</text>
  <text start="915.699" dur="4.171">to work together to fight Syria and I</text>
  <text start="918.61" dur="3.419">don&amp;#39;t think this is going to happen</text>
  <text start="919.87" dur="4.5">because Russia and Syria they have this</text>
  <text start="922.029" dur="4.261">plan that every place they conquer and</text>
  <text start="924.37" dur="4.5">they wipe out the terrorists and they</text>
  <text start="926.29" dur="6.06">liberate the towns the villages the</text>
  <text start="928.87" dur="6.93">different regions they set up these the</text>
  <text start="932.35" dur="6.45">escalation zones where they take them</text>
  <text start="935.8" dur="4.74">they bring in police to control them</text>
  <text start="938.8" dur="3.479">they don&amp;#39;t they just don&amp;#39;t leave them</text>
  <text start="940.54" dur="3.479">open and this is military police that</text>
  <text start="942.279" dur="4.831">they bring in and they make sure that</text>
  <text start="944.019" dur="4.891">they&amp;#39;re secure and they give them a lot</text>
  <text start="947.11" dur="4.229">of weaponry to make sure that these</text>
  <text start="948.91" dur="3.929">areas never fall back under the</text>
  <text start="951.339" dur="3.18">terrorists group so they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="952.839" dur="4.44">this all along the last place they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="954.519" dur="5.88">done this was in Homs and they just set</text>
  <text start="957.279" dur="5.101">up their third de-escalation zone and we</text>
  <text start="960.399" dur="5.701">can see that as they continually move</text>
  <text start="962.38" dur="5.43">and push the terrorists east this is</text>
  <text start="966.1" dur="4.2">exactly what they&amp;#39;re going to do and I</text>
  <text start="967.81" dur="4.829">think right now with a lot of these</text>
  <text start="970.3" dur="6.21">terrorist groups that are defecting and</text>
  <text start="972.639" dur="6.39">joining the Syrian forces this is a huge</text>
  <text start="976.51" dur="4.17">problem for the deef State I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="979.029" dur="3.93">only a matter of time before Russia and</text>
  <text start="980.68" dur="5.61">Syria announce that you know they are</text>
  <text start="982.959" dur="4.171">victorious and they want the United</text>
  <text start="986.29" dur="2.7">States and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="987.13" dur="4.64">coalition forces to leave the country I</text>
  <text start="988.99" dur="5.55">think we&amp;#39;re months away from this and</text>
  <text start="991.77" dur="4.45">the deep state I think they realize</text>
  <text start="994.54" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re months away from this and</text>
  <text start="996.22" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;re gonna need to do something</text>
  <text start="999.7" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re going to need to strike back</text>
  <text start="1001.92" dur="4.56">somehow some way they&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="1004.74" dur="4.17">strike back at trump they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1006.48" dur="4.23">have to have some type of a false flag</text>
  <text start="1008.91" dur="4.05">event they&amp;#39;re going to try to get war</text>
  <text start="1010.71" dur="5.61">started they&amp;#39;re going to have to do</text>
  <text start="1012.96" dur="5.55">something because if they don&amp;#39;t this is</text>
  <text start="1016.32" dur="4.2">going to be their last opportunity they</text>
  <text start="1018.51" dur="6.42">know this everything that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1020.52" dur="7.049">created is now being unwound and this is</text>
  <text start="1024.93" dur="6.56">why you&amp;#39;re going to see everything get a</text>
  <text start="1027.569" dur="8.191">lot worse a lot chaotic before it all</text>
  <text start="1031.49" dur="6.88">collapses and I hope that if there is</text>
  <text start="1035.76" dur="5.12">some type of an event if there is some</text>
  <text start="1038.37" dur="5.64">type of false flag I should say</text>
  <text start="1040.88" dur="5.53">someplace maybe out in Syria because we</text>
  <text start="1044.01" dur="4.83">know they smuggled a nuke in a while</text>
  <text start="1046.41" dur="4.98">back into the Aleppo area don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1048.84" dur="5.07">where that is right now we also know out</text>
  <text start="1051.39" dur="5.73">in North Korea they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="1053.91" dur="5.16">the agenda of a surgical strike in North</text>
  <text start="1057.12" dur="5.49">Korea trying to push Trump in that</text>
  <text start="1059.07" dur="6.33">direction and they might try some type</text>
  <text start="1062.61" dur="5.4">of force like event they might who knows</text>
  <text start="1065.4" dur="5.61">go across the border sync across the</text>
  <text start="1068.01" dur="5.43">border fire some type of missile into</text>
  <text start="1071.01" dur="4.41">South Korea and they might try to get</text>
  <text start="1073.44" dur="4.62">the war started that way or when they</text>
  <text start="1075.42" dur="4.17">track these missiles and if they if</text>
  <text start="1078.06" dur="4.17">North Korea can actually get a missile</text>
  <text start="1079.59" dur="6.18">to actually fly on up break apart they</text>
  <text start="1082.23" dur="8.16">might move a ship very close to that</text>
  <text start="1085.77" dur="6.87">area and have it maybe hit it or come</text>
  <text start="1090.39" dur="5.28">very close and have it explode near it</text>
  <text start="1092.64" dur="5.37">where they can say they meant to hit</text>
  <text start="1095.67" dur="4.62">this ship I mean there&amp;#39;s so many things</text>
  <text start="1098.01" dur="5.07">that they can do and I wouldn&amp;#39;t put it</text>
  <text start="1100.29" dur="4.59">past them where they might try any of</text>
  <text start="1103.08" dur="3.99">these things so we can see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1104.88" dur="4.5">their days are numbered and they&amp;#39;re</text>
