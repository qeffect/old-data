  <text start="171.2" dur="3.72">that in a minute</text>
  <text start="172.07" dur="5.97">we&amp;#39;re Richter Wolff Richter really</text>
  <text start="174.92" dur="4.95">describes and explains how we&amp;#39;ve hit</text>
  <text start="178.04" dur="4.56">this point where everything&amp;#39;s starting</text>
  <text start="179.87" dur="4.73">to switch now and everything&amp;#39;s starting</text>
  <text start="182.6" dur="4.219">to come down but we need to remember</text>
  <text start="184.6" dur="3.869">that all these numbers</text>
  <text start="186.819" dur="4.26">are thrown out there like GDP</text>
  <text start="188.469" dur="5.071">unemployment and the rest these are just</text>
  <text start="191.079" dur="4.92">numbers and we need to remember</text>
  <text start="193.54" dur="5.279">something very important that the stock</text>
  <text start="195.999" dur="5.341">market was soaring the GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="198.819" dur="6.2">looked okay just prior to the great</text>
  <text start="201.34" dur="7.47">financial crisis of 2000-2008 and we saw</text>
  <text start="205.019" dur="7.211">how that all turned out the truth is is</text>
  <text start="208.81" dur="5.73">that GDP is not the best measure for the</text>
  <text start="212.23" dur="5.039">health of an economy yes the corporate</text>
  <text start="214.54" dur="4.5">media yes the government yes the Fed</text>
  <text start="217.269" dur="2.34">could say yes GDP if it&amp;#39;s a higher</text>
  <text start="219.04" dur="3.179">number</text>
  <text start="219.609" dur="4.86">it means the economy is doing well but</text>
  <text start="222.219" dur="4.74">judging the US economy by GDP is</text>
  <text start="224.469" dur="4.291">basically like measuring the financial</text>
  <text start="226.959" dur="5.221">health of an individual by how much</text>
  <text start="228.76" dur="5.52">money he or she spends and if I went out</text>
  <text start="232.18" dur="4.11">right now and I got a whole bunch of new</text>
  <text start="234.28" dur="3.81">credit cards and started spending money</text>
  <text start="236.29" dur="4.589">like there was no tomorrow would that</text>
  <text start="238.09" dur="5.459">mean that my financial condition had</text>
  <text start="240.879" dur="5.19">improved no in fact it would mean that</text>
  <text start="243.549" dur="4.5">my long-term financial condition just</text>
  <text start="246.069" dur="4.98">got a whole lot worse because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="248.049" dur="5.421">putting myself into debt GDP is a</text>
  <text start="251.049" dur="5.641">measurement of how much economic</text>
  <text start="253.47" dur="5.65">activity is happening in our society and</text>
  <text start="256.69" dur="5.37">is basically an indication of how much</text>
  <text start="259.12" dur="5.07">money is changing hands but just because</text>
  <text start="262.06" dur="4.62">more money is changing hands does not</text>
  <text start="264.19" dur="4.89">mean that things are going well what</text>
  <text start="266.68" dur="4.579">really matters is what is happening to</text>
  <text start="269.08" dur="6.63">assets and liabilities in other words is</text>
  <text start="271.259" dur="7.061">wealth being built or is more debt just</text>
  <text start="275.71" dur="5.72">being accumulated and as we can say a</text>
  <text start="278.32" dur="5.279">lot more debt is being accumulated</text>
  <text start="281.43" dur="5.019">economic growth that is produced by</text>
  <text start="283.599" dur="5.491">continually increasing the amount of</text>
  <text start="286.449" dur="3.451">debt is not a positive thing I mean</text>
  <text start="289.09" dur="4.109">think about when the corporate media</text>
  <text start="289.9" dur="5.28">comes out and says oh look spending is</text>
  <text start="293.199" dur="5.821">up people are spending like crazy and</text>
  <text start="295.18" dur="6.75">they show how much people have put on to</text>
  <text start="299.02" dur="5.13">their credit cards that is just debt</text>
  <text start="301.93" dur="5.31">that&amp;#39;s not their money they&amp;#39;re borrowing</text>
  <text start="304.15" dur="5.37">that money with either 15 20 or 30</text>
  <text start="307.24" dur="4.799">percent interest that doesn&amp;#39;t mean the</text>
  <text start="309.52" dur="6.72">economy&amp;#39;s doing well but the central</text>
  <text start="312.039" dur="6.141">bankers have brainwashed all of us into</text>
  <text start="316.24" dur="4.91">thinking that more</text>
  <text start="318.18" dur="5.58">means that things are better if you are</text>
  <text start="321.15" dur="5.43">spending and putting all this on your</text>
  <text start="323.76" dur="6.42">credit cards it is better no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="326.58" dur="5.25">actually worse and we can see this by</text>
  <text start="330.18" dur="6.54">certain numbers now let&amp;#39;s take a look at</text>
  <text start="331.83" dur="6.45">this the US consumer credit just hit</text>
  <text start="336.72" dur="3.87">another all-time record high in the</text>
  <text start="338.28" dur="4.41">second quarter of 2008 total consumer</text>
  <text start="340.59" dur="4.83">credit reached a grand total of two</text>
  <text start="342.69" dur="5.43">point six three trillion dollars and now</text>
  <text start="345.42" dur="4.38">ten years later that number has soared</text>
  <text start="348.12" dur="3.87">to three point eight seven trillion</text>
  <text start="349.8" dur="5.1">dollars this is an increase of forty</text>

  <text start="434.91" dur="3.9">commitments that we&amp;#39;ve made that we</text>
  <text start="436.71" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t have the money for it this moment</text>
  <text start="438.81" dur="5.76">according to Professor Larry Kotlikoff</text>
  <text start="441.03" dur="6.63">our our unfunded liabilities are well in</text>
  <text start="444.57" dur="5.76">excess of 200 trillion dollars right now</text>
  <text start="447.66" dur="3.88">and when we start to look at all this we</text>
  <text start="450.33" dur="2.38">can see that yeah</text>
  <text start="451.54" dur="3.93">the numbers that they&amp;#39;re throwing at us</text>
  <text start="452.71" dur="4.8">they really don&amp;#39;t mean that much when</text>
  <text start="455.47" dur="3.87">you look at the everyday person on how</text>
  <text start="457.51" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re living how they&amp;#39;re doing I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="459.34" dur="4.17">talking about hope I&amp;#39;m not talking about</text>

  <text start="463.51" dur="4.68">talking about what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="466.12" dur="4.68">what&amp;#39;s happening in real estate what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.19" dur="4.65">happening in retail what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="470.8" dur="3.99">during the holiday season what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="472.84" dur="3.81">happening during the summer scene season</text>
  <text start="474.79" dur="4.17">with real estate what&amp;#39;s happening with</text>
  <text start="476.65" dur="3.87">the automobile manufacturers now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="478.96" dur="4.95">hiding their data they don&amp;#39;t want you to</text>
  <text start="480.52" dur="5.67">know their deliveries the Fed is hiding</text>
  <text start="483.91" dur="4.52">their data or changing their data</text>
  <text start="486.19" dur="5.94">there&amp;#39;s a reason for all this</text>
  <text start="488.43" dur="6.76">this central bank illusion is starting</text>
  <text start="492.13" dur="5.67">to fall apart now Wolfe Richter put this</text>
  <text start="495.19" dur="5.4">together and he is showing that the</text>
  <text start="497.8" dur="5.87">housing market has hit an inflection</text>
  <text start="500.59" dur="5.82">point and we&amp;#39;ve seen this before back in</text>
  <text start="503.67" dur="4.81">2006-7 no one really noticed what it was</text>
  <text start="506.41" dur="3.6">before they thought oh it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="508.48" dur="4.38">little slowdown things will get better</text>
  <text start="510.01" dur="4.53">no one really really realized that we</text>
  <text start="512.86" dur="3.45">were heading for this major major crash</text>
  <text start="514.54" dur="3.78">of course the Fed was out there saying</text>
  <text start="516.31" dur="3.81">that everything was contained and Larry</text>
  <text start="518.32" dur="3.599">Yun from the National Association of</text>
  <text start="520.12" dur="3.42">Realtors said that things were gonna get</text>
  <text start="521.919" dur="3.471">a lot better during the winter when</text>
  <text start="523.54" dur="5.34">everything was completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="525.39" dur="6.19">now the inflection point Wolfe is saying</text>
  <text start="528.88" dur="5.4">is in June and this is how the</text>
  <text start="531.58" dur="5.34">inflection points show up at the sub</text>
  <text start="534.28" dur="5.22">continuous level in all housing markets</text>
  <text start="536.92" dur="4.65">the first obvious sign that something</text>
  <text start="539.5" dur="2.58">was up that something wasn&amp;#39;t going the</text>
  <text start="541.57" dur="4.59">right way</text>
  <text start="542.08" dur="5.97">came on June 6 2017 when the housing</text>
  <text start="546.16" dur="4.38">market in Sonoma County was still</text>
  <text start="548.05" dur="4.26">booming according to the data now Sonoma</text>
  <text start="550.54" dur="3.81">County is a little north of San</text>
  <text start="552.31" dur="5.22">Francisco between the Pacific and Napa</text>
  <text start="554.35" dur="7.44">County and something very interesting is</text>
  <text start="557.53" dur="8.1">happening in this area that brokers</text>
  <text start="561.79" dur="7.92">would receive a one thousand cash raffle</text>
  <text start="565.63" dur="6.51">by Sotheby&amp;#39;s for a broker&amp;#39;s tour of four</text>
  <text start="569.71" dur="5.4">homes in the city of Novato and</text>
  <text start="572.14" dur="5.67">Sotheby&amp;#39;s was trying to sell this in</text>
  <text start="575.11" dur="4.59">this fashion the thousand dollars would</text>
  <text start="577.81" dur="6.02">go to the winning broker who sold the</text>
  <text start="579.7" dur="5.759">home now these kinds of antics are</text>
  <text start="583.83" dur="4.299">beginning</text>
  <text start="585.459" dur="5.55">signs that it&amp;#39;s getting tougher to sell</text>
  <text start="588.129" dur="7.32">homes at the prices sellers envisioned</text>
  <text start="591.009" dur="6.63">in June and July of 2018 supply suddenly</text>
  <text start="595.449" dur="5.461">shot to the highest level in years now</text>
  <text start="597.639" dur="5.55">the Realtors up in this area they are</text>
  <text start="600.91" dur="4.26">seeing something that&amp;#39;s very strange and</text>
  <text start="603.189" dur="4.2">now they&amp;#39;re thinking back to what</text>
  <text start="605.17" dur="6">happened during 2000 set what happened</text>
  <text start="607.389" dur="5.461">in 2006-2007 leading into 2008 when</text>
  <text start="611.17" dur="3.57">things started to go a little crazy in</text>
  <text start="612.85" dur="4.679">the real estate market what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="614.74" dur="6.569">saying right now is that of the hundred</text>
  <text start="617.529" dur="6.391">and fourteen new listings 30 had been</text>
  <text start="621.309" dur="5.731">listed before and been and it had been</text>
  <text start="623.92" dur="6">pulled because they didn&amp;#39;t sell and now</text>
  <text start="627.04" dur="6.329">they were back on the market as a new</text>
  <text start="629.92" dur="7.8">listing now this was a common practice</text>
  <text start="633.369" dur="5.671">back in 2007-2008 where if nobody was</text>
  <text start="637.72" dur="3.059">coming to your home new moment was</text>
  <text start="639.04" dur="3.839">visiting note you didn&amp;#39;t have any offers</text>
  <text start="640.779" dur="4.62">and you had it on there like three weeks</text>
  <text start="642.879" dur="5.01">or a month or so and you had no nibbles</text>
  <text start="645.399" dur="4.771">whatsoever you pulled it off the listing</text>
  <text start="647.889" dur="3.721">and you waited for a certain period of</text>
  <text start="650.17" dur="3.659">time maybe you got a different realtor</text>
  <text start="651.61" dur="5.069">and then you put it back on as a new</text>
  <text start="653.829" dur="5.13">listing to make it seem like oh another</text>
  <text start="656.679" dur="4.83">house just came on look let&amp;#39;s go take a</text>
  <text start="658.959" dur="5.37">look at it and sometimes it works</text>
  <text start="661.509" dur="5.13">sometimes it doesn&amp;#39;t in a down market it</text>
  <text start="664.329" dur="3.841">really doesn&amp;#39;t work now the broker is</text>
  <text start="666.639" dur="4.98">saying that during this period of time</text>
  <text start="668.17" dur="6.329">there were 94 price reductions now the</text>
  <text start="671.619" dur="5.041">question is why are people reducing</text>
  <text start="674.499" dur="4.71">their prices they&amp;#39;re reducing their</text>
  <text start="676.66" dur="5.519">prices because there&amp;#39;s no one out there</text>
  <text start="679.209" dur="5.1">that&amp;#39;s willing to pay what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="682.179" dur="3.991">trying to sell the house for so what do</text>
  <text start="684.309" dur="4.02">they do they start lowering it they</text>
  <text start="686.17" dur="4.949">start lowering it even more and even</text>
  <text start="688.329" dur="5.37">more to hit that sweet spot where</text>
  <text start="691.119" dur="6">someone would come in and make an offer</text>
  <text start="693.699" dur="6.091">and in a down market you have to keep</text>
  <text start="697.119" dur="4.44">lowering and the broker said that some</text>
  <text start="699.79" dur="3.959">days the price reductions alone exceed</text>
  <text start="701.559" dur="4.291">the new listings now this is the</text>
  <text start="703.749" dur="3.601">beginning stages in one area we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="705.85" dur="3.239">to start to see this spread throughout</text>
  <text start="707.35" dur="4.979">the country this is just the beginning</text>
  <text start="709.089" dur="5.58">and remember with what the central bank</text>
  <text start="712.329" dur="6.06">has been doing is they&amp;#39;ve been propping</text>
  <text start="714.669" dur="4.501">up 20 cities now that they didn&amp;#39;t do the</text>
  <text start="718.389" dur="2.79">whole country</text>
  <text start="719.17" dur="5.129">and it&amp;#39;s starting it&amp;#39;s going to start to</text>
  <text start="721.179" dur="5.34">fall apart in many of the outlying areas</text>
  <text start="724.299" dur="3.96">and it&amp;#39;s gonna move into the cities just</text>
  <text start="726.519" dur="3.54">like it did in 2008 and we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="728.259" dur="3.51">starting to see this happen this is why</text>
  <text start="730.059" dur="3.15">we see Canada the bubble popping this is</text>
  <text start="731.769" dur="4.021">why we see Australia the bubble popping</text>
  <text start="733.209" dur="4.41">this is why we see the UK it&amp;#39;s popping</text>
  <text start="735.79" dur="3.599">over there in the United States here it</text>
  <text start="737.619" dur="3.9">is beginning to pop and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="739.389" dur="3.6">to see prices come down and traffic&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="747.339" dur="3.99">about but we&amp;#39;re going to start to see</text>
  <text start="749.23" dur="3.99">that they&amp;#39;re not gonna be able to sell</text>
  <text start="751.329" dur="3.271">their homes and prices are gonna come</text>
  <text start="753.22" dur="3.599">down even further and all those people</text>
  <text start="754.6" dur="4.829">that were underwater once before back in</text>
  <text start="756.819" dur="5.13">2008 they&amp;#39;re gonna be underwater once</text>
  <text start="759.429" dur="5.611">again because their houses their housing</text>
  <text start="761.949" dur="5.01">prices are going to drop far below than</text>
  <text start="765.04" dur="4.039">they were even before because this time</text>
  <text start="766.959" dur="6.81">it&amp;#39;s going to be much much worse</text>
  <text start="769.079" dur="8.19">now kim.com is out there and he is</text>

  <text start="806.439" dur="6.84">preparation for the crash the big crash</text>
  <text start="809.019" dur="7.26">is coming 100% and he went on to say</text>
  <text start="813.279" dur="5.581">that the average total debt per family</text>
  <text start="816.279" dur="4.59">in the US is now at eight hundred and</text>

  <text start="828.999" dur="5.04">debt can be solved with economic growth</text>
  <text start="831.129" dur="8.15">new debt or printing more dollars is an</text>
  <text start="834.039" dur="8.49">idiot US Empire will default and kim.com</text>
  <text start="839.279" dur="5.89">he&amp;#39;s right that there&amp;#39;s no way that this</text>
  <text start="842.529" dur="4.381">can be sustained because with the</text>
  <text start="845.169" dur="3.84">government right now and with the Fed</text>
  <text start="846.91" dur="4.679">and everything else there&amp;#39;s no way to</text>
  <text start="849.009" dur="3.411">stop this and they&amp;#39;re not going to stop</text>
  <text start="851.589" dur="3.351">it there</text>
  <text start="852.42" dur="5.219">going to drive this economy to the edge</text>
  <text start="854.94" dur="4.98">the only way to get out of the central</text>
  <text start="857.639" dur="4.531">banking system remember the dollar that</text>
  <text start="859.92" dur="4.88">you have in your hand the 10 to 5 100</text>
  <text start="862.17" dur="7.529">whatever you have it is an instrument of</text>
  <text start="864.8" dur="8.32">debt and this is a Federal Reserve debt</text>
  <text start="869.699" dur="5.791">note it&amp;#39;s not backed by anything it&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="873.12" dur="5.7">has no value whatsoever it&amp;#39;s a piece of</text>
  <text start="875.49" dur="6.469">paper with ink on it and you owe debt</text>
  <text start="878.82" dur="6.15">when you receive that everyone owes debt</text>
  <text start="881.959" dur="4.81">because what this central bank does and</text>
  <text start="884.97" dur="5.07">many others all around the world all</text>
  <text start="886.769" dur="5.491">connected they create this out of thin</text>
  <text start="890.04" dur="4.739">air and they attach interest to it and</text>
  <text start="892.26" dur="6.3">they loan it to governments and the</text>
  <text start="894.779" dur="6.631">people have to pay this interest this is</text>
  <text start="898.56" dur="5.76">why they need to collect taxes to pay</text>
  <text start="901.41" dur="6.63">for all of this and it goes back to the</text>
  <text start="904.32" dur="7.019">central bank it&amp;#39;s a Ponzi scheme</text>
  <text start="908.04" dur="7.289">and we can see right now the only way to</text>
  <text start="911.339" dur="8.31">get out of this system is to have this</text>
  <text start="915.329" dur="7.62">system crash and burn and destroy the</text>
  <text start="919.649" dur="7.741">system that we&amp;#39;re in and create a new</text>
  <text start="922.949" dur="6.57">system that is a people run system we</text>
  <text start="927.39" dur="4.62">don&amp;#39;t need a private western central</text>
  <text start="929.519" dur="4.68">bank loaning the people money where we</text>
  <text start="932.01" dur="4.68">have to pay back the interest on this</text>
  <text start="934.199" dur="4.531">money because the people can create</text>
  <text start="936.69" dur="3.839">their own currency with no interest</text>
  <text start="938.73" dur="3.87">attached and they can do this with</text>
  <text start="940.529" dur="4.201">cryptocurrency they can do this with</text>
  <text start="942.6" dur="4.5">gold backed notes they can do it with</text>
  <text start="944.73" dur="5.43">many different methods there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="947.1" dur="5.099">to have a central bank why because they</text>
  <text start="950.16" dur="4.71">can keep the economy from crashing how</text>
  <text start="952.199" dur="7.771">many crashes have we had since they came</text>
  <text start="954.87" dur="9.209">into existence many and has the value of</text>
  <text start="959.97" dur="8.549">the dollar maintained its value no it is</text>
  <text start="964.079" dur="6.901">down 96 97 % and the government and the</text>
  <text start="968.519" dur="4.8">people continually go into further and</text>
  <text start="970.98" dur="6.96">further debt this is a no-win situation</text>
  <text start="973.319" dur="6.75">and you can see that were n we&amp;#39;re headed</text>
  <text start="977.94" dur="4.98">towards this end stage now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="980.069" dur="5.851">interesting is that the Fed came out and</text>
  <text start="982.92" dur="4.89">even though the GDP numbers were pushed</text>
  <text start="985.92" dur="3.599">and unemployment is at its lowest and</text>
  <text start="987.81" dur="4.469">the economy is supposed to be thriving</text>
  <text start="989.519" dur="5.13">the Fed looks like they might be making</text>
  <text start="992.279" dur="5.131">the decision not to raise interest rates</text>
  <text start="994.649" dur="5.761">anymore now this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="997.41" dur="4.47">because all along they told us that</text>
  <text start="1000.41" dur="3.27">we&amp;#39;re going to raise interest rates and</text>
  <text start="1001.88" dur="3.72">it looks like they&amp;#39;re countering what</text>
  <text start="1003.68" dur="4.74">Trump and the Patriots are trying to do</text>
  <text start="1005.6" dur="5.58">remember this is a battle going on right</text>
  <text start="1008.42" dur="5.099">now between the central bankers a deep</text>
  <text start="1011.18" dur="3.63">State and Trump and the Patriots and you</text>
  <text start="1013.519" dur="3.091">can see they&amp;#39;re fighting it out people</text>
  <text start="1014.81" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t realize this but that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1016.61" dur="4.77">happening to gain and control the</text>
  <text start="1019.13" dur="5.039">narrative of when this entire system</text>
