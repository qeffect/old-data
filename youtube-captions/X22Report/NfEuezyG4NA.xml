  <text start="57.14" dur="5.339">rapport my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.699" dur="7.2">episode 1519 B and today&amp;#39;s date is March</text>
  <text start="62.479" dur="6.42">12th 2018 and the title the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.899" dur="6.571">the deep state dead cat bounce might be</text>
  <text start="68.899" dur="5.281">more than one event let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="72.47" dur="4.59">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="74.18" dur="6.63">geopolitical news now since the event in</text>
  <text start="77.06" dur="7.26">Florida we see that Trump has pushing</text>
  <text start="80.81" dur="5.699">his plan for federally funding programs</text>
  <text start="84.32" dur="5.49">which would armed and trained teachers</text>
  <text start="86.509" dur="4.981">in schools and he said and he tweeted</text>
  <text start="89.81" dur="4.14">out if schools are mandated to be</text>
  <text start="91.49" dur="4.65">gun-free zones violence and danger are</text>
  <text start="93.95" dur="4.02">given an open invitation to enter almost</text>
  <text start="96.14" dur="2.369">all school shootings are in gun-free</text>
  <text start="97.97" dur="3.12">zones</text>
  <text start="98.509" dur="5.7">cowards will go where there is no</text>
  <text start="101.09" dur="6.119">deterrent and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="104.209" dur="4.981">he&amp;#39;s pushing for teachers to have</text>
  <text start="107.209" dur="4.171">weapons it&amp;#39;s on a voluntary basis those</text>
  <text start="109.19" dur="5.25">people that volunteer they&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="111.38" dur="6.779">trained and they&amp;#39;ll be able to carry a</text>
  <text start="114.44" dur="7.249">weapon to protect the students and we</text>
  <text start="118.159" dur="6.661">see right now that this is basically</text>
  <text start="121.689" dur="4.811">shifting the narrative away from gun</text>
  <text start="124.82" dur="3.24">control now I know in the beginning he</text>
  <text start="126.5" dur="5.519">came out and he said listen here we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="128.06" dur="6.12">be looking at the age and we&amp;#39;ll discuss</text>
  <text start="132.019" dur="4.56">and we&amp;#39;ll see what we can do and right</text>
  <text start="134.18" dur="4.559">now Trump says that you know he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="136.579" dur="4.741">let the courts decide before acting on</text>
  <text start="138.739" dur="4.951">age restriction now of course when all</text>
  <text start="141.32" dur="5.13">this started to happen he just came out</text>
  <text start="143.69" dur="5.73">and said we&amp;#39;ll see we&amp;#39;ll take a look at</text>
  <text start="146.45" dur="5.37">he never committed to anything and this</text>
  <text start="149.42" dur="5.7">is what he does he goes along with the</text>
  <text start="151.82" dur="6.84">corporate media he gets on their side</text>
  <text start="155.12" dur="6.239">for them to basically drop what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="158.66" dur="5.82">trying to do and their agenda was to</text>
  <text start="161.359" dur="6.241">show that you know he is for the NRA</text>
  <text start="164.48" dur="5.759">he&amp;#39;s for guns and things like that and</text>
  <text start="167.6" dur="4.71">he tried to switch the narrative which</text>
  <text start="170.239" dur="4.97">he was kind of successful in doing it</text>
  <text start="172.31" dur="5.79">where he said that we need to look at</text>
  <text start="175.209" dur="7.09">arming the teachers making these school</text>
  <text start="178.1" dur="6.23">zones much more difficult to carry a</text>
  <text start="182.299" dur="4.481">weapon into the schools because their</text>
  <text start="184.33" dur="5.6">gun free zones</text>
  <text start="186.78" dur="5.13">and he was pushing this narrative out</text>
  <text start="189.93" dur="4.11">there and of course the corporate media</text>
  <text start="191.91" dur="3.63">didn&amp;#39;t like this whatsoever because</text>
  <text start="194.04" dur="2.79">basically what they want to do is they</text>
  <text start="195.54" dur="2.55">want to have marches and they want to</text>
  <text start="196.83" dur="3.48">say let&amp;#39;s get rid of all the weapons</text>
  <text start="198.09" dur="5">that&amp;#39;s been their plan all along we see</text>
  <text start="200.31" dur="5.82">right now that Florida they passed a law</text>
  <text start="203.09" dur="5.8">where they&amp;#39;re saying that you have to be</text>
  <text start="206.13" dur="5.82">21 years or older to purchase a weapon</text>
  <text start="208.89" dur="6.63">the NRA right now has filed a lawsuit</text>
  <text start="211.95" dur="5.67">saying that this is basically a breach</text>
  <text start="215.52" dur="3.84">and violation of the Constitution and</text>
  <text start="217.62" dur="4.32">the rights of the people the complaint</text>
  <text start="219.36" dur="5.25">says the new law prohibits law-abiding</text>
  <text start="221.94" dur="4.829">citizens between the ages of 18 and 21</text>
  <text start="224.61" dur="3.21">from lawfully purchasing a firearm of</text>
  <text start="226.769" dur="3.72">any kind</text>
  <text start="227.82" dur="5.4">the lawsuit cites a report that in 2015</text>
  <text start="230.489" dur="4.561">only 1.8 percent of those arrested for a</text>
  <text start="233.22" dur="4.44">violent crime were women in that age</text>
  <text start="235.05" dur="4.38">bracket while men at the age group made</text>
  <text start="237.66" dur="4.079">up about eight point seven percent of</text>
  <text start="239.43" dur="3.9">arrests for violent crime the complaint</text>
  <text start="241.739" dur="4.051">also says the law violates the</text>
  <text start="243.33" dur="5.1">Fourteenth Amendments Equal Protection</text>
  <text start="245.79" dur="5.16">Clause by banning adults between 18 and</text>
  <text start="248.43" dur="5.839">21 from buying guns but does not apply</text>
  <text start="250.95" dur="6.42">such a ban to adults 21 and over and</text>
  <text start="254.269" dur="5.801">also they&amp;#39;re banning women from</text>
  <text start="257.37" dur="5.25">purchasing these weapons and how many</text>
  <text start="260.07" dur="4.14">mass shootings have been caused if you</text>
  <text start="262.62" dur="2.13">go by the corporate media&amp;#39;s official</text>
  <text start="264.21" dur="2.43">story</text>
  <text start="264.75" dur="5.729">how many mass shootings have been caused</text>
  <text start="266.64" dur="6.6">by women really like none and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="270.479" dur="8.011">actually violating the rights of women</text>
  <text start="273.24" dur="8.01">and they&amp;#39;re being lumped into this so</text>
  <text start="278.49" dur="5.76">you can see right now the push is on and</text>
  <text start="281.25" dur="5.25">again the right to own a weapon there is</text>
  <text start="284.25" dur="4.53">no age it doesn&amp;#39;t say you have to be 14</text>
  <text start="286.5" dur="3.14">doesn&amp;#39;t say you have to be 18 I mean</text>
  <text start="288.78" dur="3.42">think about it</text>
  <text start="289.64" dur="7.45">today they can bring you in to the Armed</text>
  <text start="292.2" dur="8.04">Forces they can have drafts and have you</text>
  <text start="297.09" dur="6.9">go into the Armed Forces they can train</text>
  <text start="300.24" dur="6.54">you on weapon systems they can teach you</text>
  <text start="303.99" dur="5.1">how to use a real machine gun they can</text>
  <text start="306.78" dur="4.62">show you how to use a hand grenade they</text>
  <text start="309.09" dur="8.579">can show you how to use missile launch</text>
  <text start="311.4" dur="8.609">systems that&amp;#39;s okay but having a weapon</text>
  <text start="317.669" dur="6.84">at 18</text>
  <text start="320.009" dur="8.19">shotgun or anything else that&amp;#39;s not okay</text>
  <text start="324.509" dur="5.43">think about this for a second yes people</text>
  <text start="328.199" dur="3.99">are gonna say well those people the</text>
  <text start="329.939" dur="5.72">Armed Forces they&amp;#39;re trained so trained</text>
  <text start="332.189" dur="7.891">the people who are 18 on the streets</text>
  <text start="335.659" dur="8.53">what&amp;#39;s the problem with that again</text>
  <text start="340.08" dur="7.259">they&amp;#39;re violating the rights of the</text>
  <text start="344.189" dur="7.19">people and what they do is they do this</text>
  <text start="347.339" dur="6.241">very very slowly they start off with a</text>
  <text start="351.379" dur="5.26">simple little thing like let&amp;#39;s make it</text>
  <text start="353.58" dur="5.97">21 oh you know what let&amp;#39;s ban that let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="356.639" dur="4.86">ban this and before you know it they</text>
  <text start="359.55" dur="4.039">keep adding these laws I mean you know</text>
  <text start="361.499" dur="5.01">how many gun laws we have today</text>
  <text start="363.589" dur="7.091">thousands upon thousands upon thousands</text>
  <text start="366.509" dur="6.27">have any of these laws worked think</text>
  <text start="370.68" dur="4.549">about the oldest law that we have thou</text>
  <text start="372.779" dur="4.91">shalt not kill</text>
  <text start="375.229" dur="5.8">does that stop people from killing I</text>
  <text start="377.689" dur="5.47">mean it is a law it says you can&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="381.029" dur="5.67">you&amp;#39;ll be arrested and maybe put to</text>
  <text start="383.159" dur="7.34">death but it has it stopped anyone for</text>
  <text start="386.699" dur="9.661">thousands of years no it hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="390.499" dur="12.94">laws don&amp;#39;t stop bad people from doing</text>
  <text start="396.36" dur="9.029">bad things yes those good people will</text>
  <text start="403.439" dur="3.48">look at the law and though they just</text>
  <text start="405.389" dur="4.981">won&amp;#39;t do it because they&amp;#39;re good people</text>
  <text start="406.919" dur="6.84">but bad people they don&amp;#39;t care about the</text>
  <text start="410.37" dur="6.389">laws I mean they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="413.759" dur="6.06">stealing they don&amp;#39;t care about dealing</text>
  <text start="416.759" dur="5.43">drugs they don&amp;#39;t care about killing they</text>
  <text start="419.819" dur="4.89">don&amp;#39;t care about anything like that they</text>
  <text start="422.189" dur="4.41">could care less about the laws because</text>
  <text start="424.709" dur="5.07">if they did care about the laws they</text>
  <text start="426.599" dur="5.88">wouldn&amp;#39;t do these things but once again</text>
  <text start="429.779" dur="7.35">we just keep on adding more and more</text>
  <text start="432.479" dur="8.49">laws it makes no sense well it makes</text>
  <text start="437.129" dur="7.44">sense to some of us we all know what has</text>
  <text start="440.969" dur="6.03">happened here we all know the anomalies</text>
  <text start="444.569" dur="4.62">and that&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;ll say about that</text>
  <text start="446.999" dur="3.75">now a couple reports ago even yesterday</text>
  <text start="449.189" dur="5.121">we&amp;#39;re talking about the scribbled case</text>
  <text start="450.749" dur="7.501">where there this British spy Sergei</text>
  <text start="454.31" dur="6.52">most likely a double agent was poisoned</text>
  <text start="458.25" dur="5.85">and left both him and his daughter</text>
  <text start="460.83" dur="6.839">critically ill and British Prime</text>
  <text start="464.1" dur="7.26">Minister Theresa May has finally spoken</text>
  <text start="467.669" dur="7.25">about the murder attempt on the former</text>
  <text start="471.36" dur="3.559">British spy sergey skripnikov</text>
  <text start="477.62" dur="7.84">but we do believe it&amp;#39;s Russia and</text>
  <text start="480.47" dur="7.69">instead of proving them guilty we would</text>
  <text start="485.46" dur="5.459">like to have Russia prove that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="488.16" dur="6.78">innocent I mean think about what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="490.919" dur="7.56">saying right now I mean it does it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="494.94" dur="7.11">just unbelievable that they&amp;#39;re reversing</text>
  <text start="498.479" dur="7.531">the burden of proof prove that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="502.05" dur="6.78">innocent instead of us having to gather</text>
  <text start="506.01" dur="5.73">all the evidence and present the case</text>
  <text start="508.83" dur="5.43">and show that Russia was responsible for</text>
  <text start="511.74" dur="4.469">this the reason why they&amp;#39;re reversing</text>
  <text start="514.26" dur="4.92">the burden of proof is because they</text>
  <text start="516.209" dur="6.031">can&amp;#39;t find any evidence because it</text>
  <text start="519.18" dur="4.169">wasn&amp;#39;t Russia but they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="522.24" dur="3.12">look at that and they put this</text>
  <text start="523.349" dur="2.971">propaganda out there and the Guardian</text>
  <text start="525.36" dur="3.71">and the rest of the corporate media</text>
  <text start="526.32" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re out there you know pushing this</text>
  <text start="529.07" dur="7.51">idea that Russia should prove that</text>
  <text start="532.41" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;re innocent we see out in Italy new</text>
  <text start="536.58" dur="5.37">statistics from the recent Italian</text>
  <text start="538.68" dur="6.57">election show that 75% of the youngest</text>
  <text start="541.95" dur="6.48">first-time voters born in 1999 voted for</text>
  <text start="545.25" dur="4.95">anti-establishment parties the data</text>
  <text start="548.43" dur="5.31">which was compiled by Italian polling</text>
  <text start="550.2" dur="6.24">firm swg shows that the vast majority of</text>
  <text start="553.74" dur="4.89">young first-time voters reject the</text>
  <text start="556.44" dur="4.589">political establishment we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="558.63" dur="5.79">to see a movement now we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="561.029" dur="4.521">see individuals in all different</text>
  <text start="564.42" dur="6.359">countries saying you know something</text>
  <text start="565.55" dur="7.59">we&amp;#39;re done with the establishment we</text>
  <text start="570.779" dur="5.341">want something completely different and</text>
  <text start="573.14" dur="6.34">this is why their people are getting out</text>
  <text start="576.12" dur="5.25">there and saying we want something</text>
  <text start="579.48" dur="3.27">different that&amp;#39;s not part of the</text>

  <text start="893.579" dur="6.24">know had to how to leave because they</text>
  <text start="896.61" dur="5.909">were losing they found the areas where</text>
  <text start="899.819" dur="5.541">they were producing the sarin gas a lot</text>
  <text start="902.519" dur="6">of the sarin gas was shipped in from</text>
  <text start="905.36" dur="5.349">Iraq and other areas where the deep</text>
  <text start="908.519" dur="4.44">state had control of those areas and</text>
  <text start="910.709" dur="4.05">they had the sarin gas so they took it</text>
  <text start="912.959" dur="4.291">and they moved it into Syria so they</text>
  <text start="914.759" dur="5.421">could use it there but the reason why</text>
  <text start="917.25" dur="5.069">they&amp;#39;re playing this up right now where</text>
  <text start="920.18" dur="4.54">first of all man who says there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="922.319" dur="5.07">evidence whatsoever that Assad has used</text>
  <text start="924.72" dur="5.07">chemical weapons and he did say yeah</text>
  <text start="927.389" dur="5.07">they better not use them but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="929.79" dur="3.989">playing that part of it up because what</text>
  <text start="932.459" dur="4.831">I think they&amp;#39;re doing right now is</text>
  <text start="933.779" dur="6.721">they&amp;#39;re getting ready for a major event</text>
  <text start="937.29" dur="5.07">and they&amp;#39;re getting prepared because</text>
  <text start="940.5" dur="4.139">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to do something out in</text>
  <text start="942.36" dur="4.8">Syria much larger than they&amp;#39;ve done in</text>
  <text start="944.639" dur="5.19">the past and I think this dead cat</text>
  <text start="947.16" dur="4.859">bounce that Q was talking about is going</text>
  <text start="949.829" dur="3.69">to be multiple events I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="952.019" dur="3.51">just gonna be one is it gonna happen at</text>
  <text start="953.519" dur="4.711">the same time no but what I think is</text>
  <text start="955.529" dur="4.351">going to happen is there might be an</text>
  <text start="958.23" dur="4.709">event here on the soil of the United</text>
  <text start="959.88" dur="5.85">States and then events out in the Middle</text>
  <text start="962.939" dur="7.65">East or maybe even near North Korea to</text>
  <text start="965.73" dur="8.459">try to rattle Trump&amp;#39;s chain there to get</text>
  <text start="970.589" dur="7.081">him all nervous and afraid maybe they</text>
  <text start="974.189" dur="5.791">will fire a missile from a sub in the</text>
  <text start="977.67" dur="5.37">region to make it look like North Korea</text>
  <text start="979.98" dur="6.63">is doing something but I do believe that</text>
  <text start="983.04" dur="4.979">they&amp;#39;re going to try multiple events and</text>
  <text start="986.61" dur="2.7">this is going to be the dead cat bounce</text>
  <text start="988.019" dur="3.241">that Cuba</text>
  <text start="989.31" dur="4.56">talking about where they&amp;#39;re gonna try</text>
  <text start="991.26" dur="5.13">one last try now I think it&amp;#39;s not gonna</text>
  <text start="993.87" dur="3.72">happen you know on Tuesday and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="996.39" dur="3.84">gonna try everything all at once</text>
  <text start="997.59" dur="4.47">I think one at a time but they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1000.23" dur="3.18">be very close together the reason why I</text>
  <text start="1002.06" dur="5.16">think this is they&amp;#39;re gonna want to</text>
  <text start="1003.41" dur="7.41">create as much chaos as possible to</text>
  <text start="1007.22" dur="6.869">flood the new cycles because right now</text>
  <text start="1010.82" dur="5.73">the new cycles are things they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1014.089" dur="4.891">really want to report on and this is why</text>
  <text start="1016.55" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re going after a lot of propaganda</text>
  <text start="1018.98" dur="4.59">a lot of emotional things things that</text>
  <text start="1020.9" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t even matter at this point</text>
  <text start="1023.57" dur="4.41">but they&amp;#39;re gonna keep playing those</text>
  <text start="1025.04" dur="5.46">other things up until they get something</text>
  <text start="1027.98" dur="4.62">else in the new cycle and this is why I</text>
  <text start="1030.5" dur="4.65">think is going to be a multiple type of</text>
  <text start="1032.6" dur="4.979">an event where they can have one thing</text>
  <text start="1035.15" dur="6.27">after another to keep the new cycle very</text>
  <text start="1037.579" dur="5.551">very busy to not report on anything else</text>
  <text start="1041.42" dur="3.3">and keep everyone else in the dark who</text>
  <text start="1043.13" dur="4.709">pays attention to the corporate media</text>
  <text start="1044.72" dur="5.85">but as we can see we sift through all of</text>
  <text start="1047.839" dur="5.431">that and most of it is just absolute</text>
  <text start="1050.57" dur="5.21">junk and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="1053.27" dur="5.43">that Kaspersky is out there and</text>
  <text start="1055.78" dur="5.62">researchers they&amp;#39;ve uncovered new</text>
  <text start="1058.7" dur="4.71">malware that has apparently been used to</text>
  <text start="1061.4" dur="6.9">spy on victims in the Middle East and</text>
  <text start="1063.41" dur="6.75">Africa for six years undetected and what</text>
  <text start="1068.3" dur="4.25">they&amp;#39;re saying this malware is called</text>
  <text start="1070.16" dur="5.4">slingshot and it has been infected</text>
  <text start="1072.55" dur="7.3">infecting victims collecting a wide</text>
  <text start="1075.56" dur="7.35">variety of data and exfiltrating it in a</text>
  <text start="1079.85" dur="5.24">convert covert fashion the company says</text>
  <text start="1082.91" dur="3.53">the threat is likely the work of a</text>
  <text start="1085.09" dur="4.93">resource-rich</text>
  <text start="1086.44" dur="5.41">government hmm I wonder which government</text>
  <text start="1090.02" dur="5.1">that could be I wonder what intelligent</text>
  <text start="1091.85" dur="5.88">agency is using this now</text>
  <text start="1095.12" dur="5.22">sling slot slingshot is very complex and</text>
  <text start="1097.73" dur="4.59">the developers behind it have clearly</text>
  <text start="1100.34" dur="5.18">spent a great deal of time and money on</text>
  <text start="1102.32" dur="5.97">its creation its infection vector is</text>
  <text start="1105.52" dur="6.46">remarkable and to the best of their</text>
  <text start="1108.29" dur="6.69">knowledge and unique now the researchers</text>
  <text start="1111.98" dur="6.03">say that slingshots infection vector for</text>
  <text start="1114.98" dur="5.55">most victims is unknown but that in some</text>
  <text start="1118.01" dur="5.01">cases the attackers gain access to and</text>
  <text start="1120.53" dur="6.26">deployed the malware through</text>
  <text start="1123.02" dur="7.08">routers manufactured by mikrotik a</text>
  <text start="1126.79" dur="5.68">latvian company in those cases the</text>
  <text start="1130.1" dur="4.56">victims unknown lee download a dynamic</text>
  <text start="1132.47" dur="5.64">link library dll from the router that</text>
  <text start="1134.66" dur="5.31">was placed by the apt from there the dll</text>
  <text start="1138.11" dur="4.86">continues to download other malicious</text>
  <text start="1139.97" dur="5.13">components the slingshot malware</text>
  <text start="1142.97" dur="4.62">framework can gain control of computers</text>
  <text start="1145.1" dur="5.4">at the kernel level giving the group</text>
  <text start="1147.59" dur="4.77">complete control of victims devices it</text>
  <text start="1150.5" dur="3.87">does this by loading vulnerable drivers</text>
  <text start="1152.36" dur="3.78">into the computer and running its own</text>
  <text start="1154.37" dur="3.72">code through the router vulnerabilities</text>
  <text start="1156.14" dur="3.24">and they can take control and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1158.09" dur="5.04">been doing this throughout the Middle</text>
  <text start="1159.38" dur="7.53">East and Africa to spy on people out</text>
  <text start="1163.13" dur="6.8">there and we see right now this does</text>
  <text start="1166.91" dur="6.41">look like the work of maybe volts 7 CIA</text>
  <text start="1169.93" dur="6.55">intelligence to get an understanding of</text>
  <text start="1173.32" dur="6.16">what people are doing out there getting</text>
  <text start="1176.48" dur="6.69">understanding of is there a revolution</text>
  <text start="1179.48" dur="5.88">growing our people rising up how can we</text>
  <text start="1183.17" dur="4.26">keep our puppet governments in power and</text>
  <text start="1185.36" dur="4.74">I believe this is why they were out</text>
  <text start="1187.43" dur="4.32">there also in Africa keep an eye on what</text>
  <text start="1190.1" dur="3.27">Russia China what they&amp;#39;re doing out</text>
  <text start="1191.75" dur="4.11">there what people are talking about and</text>
  <text start="1193.37" dur="6.12">we can see right now the intelligence</text>
  <text start="1195.86" dur="5.64">agencies the deep state they are backed</text>
  <text start="1199.49" dur="3.75">into a corner it&amp;#39;s getting worse for</text>
  <text start="1201.5" dur="3.84">them every day these investigations are</text>
  <text start="1203.24" dur="4.83">going on we already see that the</text>
  <text start="1205.34" dur="5.22">investigation in FISA uranium one</text>
  <text start="1208.07" dur="4.92">there&amp;#39;s already an investigative group</text>
  <text start="1210.56" dur="5.15">that&amp;#39;s already out there doing it and</text>
  <text start="1212.99" dur="7.71">they&amp;#39;re gaining evidence they&amp;#39;re gaining</text>
  <text start="1215.71" dur="7.12">documentation and I I would see maybe in</text>
  <text start="1220.7" dur="4.83">a month or two or three months or four</text>
  <text start="1222.83" dur="5.22">months all of a sudden we start to hear</text>
  <text start="1225.53" dur="5.01">a lot of information come out from the</text>
  <text start="1228.05" dur="5.94">government the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="1230.54" dur="5.82">saying that this is who we have this is</text>
  <text start="1233.99" dur="4.65">the evidence that we collected and full</text>
  <text start="1236.36" dur="5.52">investigations are now being opened up</text>
  <text start="1238.64" dur="4.59">and the corporate media well who knows</text>
  <text start="1241.88" dur="2.94">what they&amp;#39;ll do at that point</text>
  <text start="1243.23" dur="3.33">but this is the part where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1244.82" dur="3.33">trying to keep the new cycles very busy</text>
  <text start="1246.56" dur="4.68">because they don&amp;#39;t want that information</text>
  <text start="1248.15" dur="5.43">out there and the deep state is trapped</text>
  <text start="1251.24" dur="4.59">at this point I mean the only way out of</text>
  <text start="1253.58" dur="3.36">this whole situation that I see is to</text>
  <text start="1255.83" dur="4.08">have the event of all</text>
  <text start="1256.94" dur="4.38">events and I think eventually they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1259.91" dur="5.06">gonna have to either move in that</text>
  <text start="1261.32" dur="7.65">direction or fold because as we can see</text>
  <text start="1264.97" dur="5.71">if Trump and the Patriots go after the</text>
  <text start="1268.97" dur="6.33">central bank cut off all the funding</text>
  <text start="1270.68" dur="6.6">that will end the deep state if he just</text>
  <text start="1275.3" dur="4.77">goes after the deep state and prosecutes</text>
  <text start="1277.28" dur="6.39">certain individuals this whole thing</text>
  <text start="1280.07" dur="7.44">does not end it continues so it has to</text>
  <text start="1283.67" dur="7.32">be an all the central bank and the deep</text>
  <text start="1287.51" dur="6.48">state or if that doesn&amp;#39;t happen this</text>
  <text start="1290.99" dur="5.79">whole nightmare will continue and it</text>
  <text start="1293.99" dur="4.98">will not end this is what we&amp;#39;re watching</text>
  <text start="1296.78" dur="4.41">and we can see this is the direction I</text>
  <text start="1298.97" dur="4.2">believe that he is moving and I see</text>
  <text start="1301.19" dur="4.11">already with North Korea I see already</text>
  <text start="1303.17" dur="4.23">moving out to Iran I see already with</text>
