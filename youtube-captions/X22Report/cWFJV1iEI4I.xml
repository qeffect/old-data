  <text start="75.67" dur="5.22">like Wall Street wants to get involved</text>
  <text start="78.1" dur="5.57">with crypto currencies and of course</text>
  <text start="80.89" dur="5.76">they always go in a different direction</text>
  <text start="83.67" dur="6.309">where they like to create derivatives</text>
  <text start="86.65" dur="4.65">which are bets on bets on bets and it</text>
  <text start="89.979" dur="4.711">looks like this is what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>

  <text start="108.88" dur="5.16">rising interest in cryptocurrencies from</text>

  <text start="114.04" dur="5.43">demand for its new derivative products</text>
  <text start="117.069" dur="4.5">and we can see there are still traders</text>
  <text start="119.47" dur="5.069">out there and those people that are in</text>
  <text start="121.569" dur="6.571">the crypto market they&amp;#39;re not too happy</text>
  <text start="124.539" dur="8.491">about what is happening with this we</text>
  <text start="128.14" dur="6.9">also see out in Venezuela that Maduro is</text>
  <text start="133.03" dur="4.62">looking to completely bypass the dollar</text>
  <text start="135.04" dur="5.7">now they were talking about using the</text>
  <text start="137.65" dur="5.73">yuan the petrol yuan to trade oil and</text>
  <text start="140.74" dur="5.49">he&amp;#39;s thinking about coming up with a</text>
  <text start="143.38" dur="5.85">cryptocurrency which would be backed by</text>
  <text start="146.23" dur="5.01">oil reserves and they would be calling</text>
  <text start="149.23" dur="4.5">it the petros this way they bypass the</text>
  <text start="151.24" dur="5.46">dollar completely and if you notice</text>
  <text start="153.73" dur="5.369">there has been a pattern where countries</text>
  <text start="156.7" dur="5.07">are out there and they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="159.099" dur="4.321">whatever they possibly can to bypass the</text>
  <text start="161.77" dur="3.99">dollar and more and more countries are</text>
  <text start="163.42" dur="4.32">doing this now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="165.76" dur="4.29">about the crypto market I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="167.74" dur="4.38">going up and up and up and many people</text>
  <text start="170.05" dur="4.2">are saying it is a bubble maybe we are</text>
  <text start="172.12" dur="3.33">approaching a bubble and we can see</text>
  <text start="174.25" dur="3.84">there are many countries that are</text>
  <text start="175.45" dur="4.71">jumping on the crypto market many people</text>
  <text start="178.09" dur="3.989">are jumping on the crypto market the</text>
  <text start="180.16" dur="4.62">central bankers they&amp;#39;re a little bit</text>
  <text start="182.079" dur="4.291">worried about the crypto market this is</text>
  <text start="184.78" dur="3.539">why they&amp;#39;re trying to create</text>
  <text start="186.37" dur="4.199">laws where they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="188.319" dur="5.371">going after those individuals that have</text>
  <text start="190.569" dur="5.971">more than 20,000 in Bitcoin they want to</text>
  <text start="193.69" dur="5.549">tax those individuals and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="196.54" dur="6.21">to regulate it as best they possibly can</text>
  <text start="199.239" dur="5.101">now remember the crypto market the</text>
  <text start="202.75" dur="3.39">blockchain system and there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="204.34" dur="5.819">crypto currencies on the blockchain</text>
  <text start="206.14" dur="7.29">system well they&amp;#39;re completely on their</text>
  <text start="210.159" dur="5.22">own you don&amp;#39;t need a central bank you</text>
  <text start="213.43" dur="4.74">don&amp;#39;t need a bank you don&amp;#39;t pretty much</text>
  <text start="215.379" dur="5.22">need anything but I noticed that the</text>
  <text start="218.17" dur="4.649">corporate media like Bloomberg and many</text>
  <text start="220.599" dur="5.041">others they&amp;#39;re out there saying well if</text>
  <text start="222.819" dur="5.821">central banks can issue cash they can</text>
  <text start="225.64" dur="5.31">issue crypto currencies now the question</text>
  <text start="228.64" dur="3.989">is why don&amp;#39;t we need a central bank</text>
  <text start="230.95" dur="4.619">issuing a crypto currency there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="232.629" dur="6.151">need for a central bank to issue a</text>
  <text start="235.569" dur="5.371">crypto currency this is what the central</text>
  <text start="238.78" dur="5.129">banks are worried about they&amp;#39;re worried</text>
  <text start="240.94" dur="6.419">about crypto currencies growing and</text>
  <text start="243.909" dur="6.11">people realizing that the central</text>
  <text start="247.359" dur="6.78">banking system is completely obsolete</text>
  <text start="250.019" dur="9.19">and actually it is obsolete there is no</text>
  <text start="254.139" dur="8.011">benefit to a central banking system how</text>
  <text start="259.209" dur="6.751">can there be a benefit to the people if</text>
  <text start="262.15" dur="5.94">it&amp;#39;s a private corporation they issue</text>
  <text start="265.96" dur="4.679">they create the currency out of thin air</text>
  <text start="268.09" dur="5.48">just like crypto currencies and they</text>
  <text start="270.639" dur="4.891">loan it to governments with interest</text>
  <text start="273.57" dur="5.86">cryptocurrencies there&amp;#39;s no interest</text>
  <text start="275.53" dur="7.05">attached and there&amp;#39;s no cap on how much</text>
  <text start="279.43" dur="5.22">they can create and we can see</text>
  <text start="282.58" dur="3.45">throughout Europe look what happened to</text>
  <text start="284.65" dur="3.21">Greece look what&amp;#39;s happening to France</text>
  <text start="286.03" dur="4.069">Spain and the rest of the countries</text>
  <text start="287.86" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re being put into debt and</text>
  <text start="290.099" dur="4.331">eventually what happens when the debt</text>
  <text start="291.97" dur="5.97">level gets very high they have to push</text>
  <text start="294.43" dur="5.58">austerity here in the United States the</text>
  <text start="297.94" dur="5.099">Federal Reserve just keeps on creating</text>
  <text start="300.01" dur="4.65">the currency there&amp;#39;s no end and the</text>
  <text start="303.039" dur="4.111">government government officials they</text>
  <text start="304.66" dur="6.18">just keep borrowing and what does that</text>
  <text start="307.15" dur="6.51">do well it creates more and more debt</text>
  <text start="310.84" dur="7.04">and the situation just gets worse and</text>
  <text start="313.66" dur="5.46">worse as time goes on and as we can see</text>
  <text start="317.88" dur="3.97">the</text>
  <text start="319.12" dur="4.44">the central banks this is one of their</text>
  <text start="321.85" dur="3.09">biggest worries this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="323.56" dur="2.82">trying to get into the crypto market</text>
  <text start="324.94" dur="3.75">this is why they&amp;#39;re trying to create</text>
  <text start="326.38" dur="4.98">their own coin saying they can stabilize</text>
  <text start="328.69" dur="4.86">it but they don&amp;#39;t realize and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="331.36" dur="4.11">understand is that the people around the</text>
  <text start="333.55" dur="4.52">world who deal in cryptocurrency they</text>
  <text start="335.47" dur="6.72">understand that there&amp;#39;s no reason to</text>
  <text start="338.07" dur="6.49">even deal with a bank or to have a</text>
  <text start="342.19" dur="4.949">central bank manage this what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="344.56" dur="4.65">interesting I was out and I heard people</text>
  <text start="347.139" dur="5.371">talking about Bitcoin and it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="349.21" dur="5.67">younger generation I&amp;#39;m older I&amp;#39;m 52 I</text>
  <text start="352.51" dur="4.05">heard younger individuals they must have</text>
  <text start="354.88" dur="3.75">been in their late 20s or early 30s</text>
  <text start="356.56" dur="5.52">and they were talking about Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="358.63" dur="6.42">which is very surprising and they were</text>
  <text start="362.08" dur="7.44">talking about how you don&amp;#39;t need a bank</text>
  <text start="365.05" dur="9.21">how you can use Bitcoin or the other</text>
  <text start="369.52" dur="6.53">cryptocurrencies to pay for items where</text>
  <text start="374.26" dur="5.219">you can use the cryptocurrencies and</text>
  <text start="376.05" dur="6.61">receive it as a salary and there is</text>
  <text start="379.479" dur="5.551">absolutely no reason to use banks at all</text>
  <text start="382.66" dur="4.5">and I believe what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="385.03" dur="3.72">is the younger generation right now is</text>
  <text start="387.16" dur="5.069">looking at this saying there is</text>
  <text start="388.75" dur="6.18">absolutely no reason we need a central</text>
  <text start="392.229" dur="6.69">bank we need a banking system everything</text>
  <text start="394.93" dur="7.83">can be handled right from the level of</text>
  <text start="398.919" dur="5.281">the blockchain and that&amp;#39;s that and they</text>
  <text start="402.76" dur="3.57">were talking about it how much they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="404.2" dur="5.1">purchased already how high they think</text>
  <text start="406.33" dur="6.42">it&amp;#39;s going to go and we can see already</text>
  <text start="409.3" dur="4.92">that as we move forward well there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="412.75" dur="3.33">going to be more people talking about</text>
  <text start="414.22" dur="3.84">this and more people getting involved</text>
  <text start="416.08" dur="3.839">more people understanding this and this</text>
  <text start="418.06" dur="5.64">is what the central banks are very</text>
  <text start="419.919" dur="6.93">worried about we see out in the retail</text>
  <text start="423.7" dur="5.04">industry and I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="426.849" dur="4.021">brick-and-mortar stores we understand</text>
  <text start="428.74" dur="5.64">that there is a lot of problems their</text>
  <text start="430.87" dur="5.519">sales have not gone as well as the</text>
  <text start="434.38" dur="5.09">corporate media as the government is</text>
  <text start="436.389" dur="7.051">letting everyone know actually sales are</text>
  <text start="439.47" dur="6.79">terrible traffic to the stores is awful</text>
  <text start="443.44" dur="9.27">and you have to remember Amazon only</text>
  <text start="446.26" dur="10.38">represents 3% yes 3% of the overall</text>
  <text start="452.71" dur="6.72">US retail sales so when they try to make</text>
  <text start="456.64" dur="5.82">it a really big deal that Amazon is</text>
  <text start="459.43" dur="9.87">taking over the world with retail it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.46" dur="10.74">three percent of US retail sales so</text>
  <text start="469.3" dur="7.35">there is no Amazon effect it was made up</text>
  <text start="473.2" dur="6.87">to convince you of why the retail market</text>
  <text start="476.65" dur="6.96">was collapsing you know there are a</text>
  <text start="480.07" dur="8.13">hundred and seventy thousand fewer</text>
  <text start="483.61" dur="8.19">retail jobs in 2017 and no they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="488.2" dur="6.93">all go to Amazon a very very tiny</text>
  <text start="491.8" dur="6.45">percentage went over to Amazon tiny</text>
  <text start="495.13" dur="5.79">miniscule the rest of the people have no</text>
  <text start="498.25" dur="4.85">work or maybe they found a work in a</text>
  <text start="500.92" dur="5.31">restaurant if they&amp;#39;re able to do that or</text>
  <text start="503.1" dur="4.96">maybe in another retail store but we can</text>
  <text start="506.23" dur="4.65">see right now that there are many jobs</text>
  <text start="508.06" dur="5.31">being removed from the industry because</text>
  <text start="510.88" dur="6.72">what do we have we have bankruptcies we</text>
  <text start="513.37" dur="7.56">have stores closing and the traffic to</text>
  <text start="517.6" dur="6.69">retail stores is dropping purchasing of</text>
  <text start="520.93" dur="5.46">retail is dropping they don&amp;#39;t want you</text>
  <text start="524.29" dur="3.9">to know this because they want you to be</text>
  <text start="526.39" dur="4.35">convinced they want you to be convinced</text>
  <text start="528.19" dur="5.79">that everything is fine actually US</text>
  <text start="530.74" dur="5.64">factory orders have slid in October</text>
  <text start="533.98" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;ve declined and we see right now</text>
  <text start="536.38" dur="6.75">they are busy revising all the numbers</text>
  <text start="539.77" dur="7.82">now October factory orders decline by</text>
  <text start="543.13" dur="8.94">negative 0.1% and they were revised</text>
  <text start="547.59" dur="7.78">upward in September from 1.4 percent to</text>
  <text start="552.07" dur="5.82">1.7 percent month on month and durable</text>
  <text start="555.37" dur="6.03">good orders were also revised higher</text>
  <text start="557.89" dur="6.33">from their preliminary print it was down</text>
  <text start="561.4" dur="5.43">by negative 0.5 percent and they made it</text>
  <text start="564.22" dur="4.43">to eight point three percent gain so</text>
  <text start="566.83" dur="4.56">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re very busy</text>
  <text start="568.65" dur="4.48">manipulating all the numbers and making</text>
  <text start="571.39" dur="3.99">sure people believe that everything is</text>
  <text start="573.13" dur="4.53">fine well the manipulation is going to</text>
  <text start="575.38" dur="4.23">come to an end because when people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="577.66" dur="4.26">have jobs when people aren&amp;#39;t purchasing</text>
  <text start="579.61" dur="4.23">in retail and they can&amp;#39;t say oh it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="581.92" dur="3.72">Amazon effect they&amp;#39;re gonna run into</text>
  <text start="583.84" dur="2.57">trouble they ran into trouble where they</text>
  <text start="585.64" dur="2.96">used to blame</text>
  <text start="586.41" dur="4.5">on the weather oh retails not doing well</text>
  <text start="588.6" dur="3.87">because it&amp;#39;s snowed in the Northeast</text>
  <text start="590.91" dur="3.9">well what about the rest of the country</text>
  <text start="592.47" dur="4.229">oh well retails not doing well because</text>

  <text start="598.92" dur="6.719">country and this they can&amp;#39;t use anymore</text>
  <text start="602.519" dur="5.731">the Amazon effect that will come to an</text>
  <text start="605.639" dur="5.37">end people will start to realize that</text>
  <text start="608.25" dur="5.16">that is fake phony and false also we see</text>
  <text start="611.009" dur="5.401">that the bubble watch is still going on</text>
  <text start="613.41" dur="5.7">and we need to understand that this</text>
  <text start="616.41" dur="5.01">everything bubble it is a bubble in</text>
  <text start="619.11" dur="4.44">sovereign bonds it was created by the</text>
  <text start="621.42" dur="4.62">central bank attempting to corner these</text>
  <text start="623.55" dur="4.56">markets via zerp and QE now because</text>
  <text start="626.04" dur="5.339">sovereign bonds are the bedrock for the</text>
  <text start="628.11" dur="5.13">current financial system if they go into</text>
  <text start="631.379" dur="5.13">a bubble everything goes into a bubble</text>
  <text start="633.24" dur="5.13">now back in 2008 more than 80% of</text>
  <text start="636.509" dur="5.31">non-financial corporate bond issuance</text>
  <text start="638.37" dur="5.159">was rated a or above in the past five</text>
  <text start="641.819" dur="4.231">years the proportion has been</text>
  <text start="643.529" dur="5.31">consistently under 60% now what does</text>
  <text start="646.05" dur="5.219">this mean this report is telling us that</text>
  <text start="648.839" dur="4.141">even in 2008 a period that everyone</text>
  <text start="651.269" dur="4.351">admits was a disaster in terms of debt</text>
  <text start="652.98" dur="6.39">corporate bonds were less risky than</text>
  <text start="655.62" dur="7.05">they are today that means the average</text>
  <text start="659.37" dur="5.399">corporate bond is riskier than before at</text>
  <text start="662.67" dur="5.31">the same time the reforms that followed</text>
  <text start="664.769" dur="6.12">the crash of 2008 2008 mean that banks</text>
  <text start="667.98" dur="4.95">have to hold more capital but this also</text>
  <text start="670.889" dur="6.39">means they are less willing to devote</text>
  <text start="672.93" dur="7.17">capital to market making so as a result</text>
  <text start="677.279" dur="5.341">the bond market is less liquid than</text>
  <text start="680.1" dur="5.849">before so investors in corporate bonds</text>
  <text start="682.62" dur="7.079">are holding riskier less liquid assets</text>
  <text start="685.949" dur="6.271">which is worse than 2008 and we can see</text>
  <text start="689.699" dur="4.591">that things are really starting to</text>
  <text start="692.22" dur="5.25">deteriorate it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="694.29" dur="7.919">as we move forward now for the first</text>
  <text start="697.47" dur="9.599">time in modern history US government</text>
  <text start="702.209" dur="7.17">debt will surpass household debt now</text>
  <text start="707.069" dur="4.681">this is just unbelievable the federal</text>
  <text start="709.379" dur="4.921">government liabilities increased almost</text>
  <text start="711.75" dur="4.079">a hundred and fifty percent over the</text>
  <text start="714.3" dur="4.2">same period and nearly reaching</text>
  <text start="715.829" dur="3.931">household debt levels for the first time</text>
  <text start="718.5" dur="5.01">in modern</text>
  <text start="719.76" dur="6.66">history this tells us that things are</text>
  <text start="723.51" dur="5.37">out of control it tells us that the</text>
  <text start="726.42" dur="6.75">people cannot take on any more debt</text>
  <text start="728.88" dur="6.15">there at their max the government has to</text>
  <text start="733.17" dur="4.29">continually take on more and more debt</text>
  <text start="735.03" dur="4.35">it needs to take on more debt because it</text>
  <text start="737.46" dur="3.48">has to pay for all the programs it has</text>
  <text start="739.38" dur="4.44">to pay for the wonderful health</text>
  <text start="740.94" dur="5.1">insurance that the government has it</text>
  <text start="743.82" dur="5.7">also has to pay for their salaries it</text>
  <text start="746.04" dur="5.58">also has to make up for the declining</text>
  <text start="749.52" dur="4.86">tax receipts that the government is</text>
  <text start="751.62" dur="6.15">receiving there&amp;#39;s also interest on the</text>
  <text start="754.38" dur="6.09">debt and as we can see going back in</text>
  <text start="757.77" dur="5.79">time well the debt keeps on rising it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="760.47" dur="5.49">not going to end actually it accelerates</text>
  <text start="763.56" dur="4.89">when these things all happen and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="765.96" dur="3.93">what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing since 2008 now</text>
  <text start="768.45" dur="3.54">something very interesting there was a</text>
  <text start="769.89" dur="4.74">new research a new report that came out</text>
  <text start="771.99" dur="5.28">and it says that the Fed has no reason</text>
  <text start="774.63" dur="4.5">to keep raising interest rates they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="777.27" dur="3.72">saying that there&amp;#39;s no reason for the</text>
  <text start="779.13" dur="4.86">Fed to raise interest rates any more</text>
  <text start="780.99" dur="4.59">well we know why they&amp;#39;re saying this</text>
  <text start="783.99" dur="4.47">because if they start raising interest</text>
  <text start="785.58" dur="5.61">rates guess what the housing bubble pops</text>
  <text start="788.46" dur="6.51">the student loan bubble pops the auto</text>
  <text start="791.19" dur="6.21">loan bubble pops the bond market bubble</text>
  <text start="794.97" dur="4.26">pops the stock market pops everything</text>
  <text start="797.4" dur="4.56">feeds into everything else and</text>
  <text start="799.23" dur="4.83">everything comes down so now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="801.96" dur="5.1">trying to make this case of why the Fed</text>
  <text start="804.06" dur="4.62">doesn&amp;#39;t need to raise interest rates now</text>
  <text start="807.06" dur="3.75">this is coming from a former Fed</text>
  <text start="808.68" dur="3.69">official they created he&amp;#39;s an economics</text>
  <text start="810.81" dur="5.61">professor at the University of Rochester</text>
  <text start="812.37" dur="6.48">and they&amp;#39;re creating this report to show</text>
  <text start="816.42" dur="7.74">that there is no reason for the Fed to</text>
  <text start="818.85" dur="8.07">do anything now the report says that the</text>
  <text start="824.16" dur="5.4">Phillips curve is actually more like a</text>
  <text start="826.92" dur="5.55">cliff it remains flat as long as the</text>
  <text start="829.56" dur="6">actual output of the economy is below</text>
  <text start="832.47" dur="6.71">its potential output once the output gap</text>
  <text start="835.56" dur="7.59">closes inflation will spike upward and</text>
  <text start="839.18" dur="6.88">this is when the Fed should raise rates</text>
  <text start="843.15" dur="4.53">so the Fed is doing the opposite of the</text>
  <text start="846.06" dur="3.81">appropriate policy at the moment he said</text>
  <text start="847.68" dur="4.77">instead of gradually raising rates the</text>
  <text start="849.87" dur="3.89">Fed should see how long it can make the</text>
  <text start="852.45" dur="4.85">unemployment rate go</text>
  <text start="853.76" dur="5.67">this might spark a will a virtuous</text>
  <text start="857.3" dur="4.35">circle getting more people involved in</text>
  <text start="859.43" dur="4.2">the labor market and sparked more demand</text>
  <text start="861.65" dur="7.44">and capital investment which in turn</text>
  <text start="863.63" dur="7.53">leads to more jobs well know the</text>
  <text start="869.09" dur="4.44">unemployment numbers are fake they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="871.16" dur="4.77">phony people aren&amp;#39;t getting the high</text>
  <text start="873.53" dur="4.32">paying jobs they&amp;#39;re getting jobs in</text>
  <text start="875.93" dur="3.63">retail which now they&amp;#39;re getting laid</text>
  <text start="877.85" dur="4.05">off they&amp;#39;re getting jobs in restaurants</text>
  <text start="879.56" dur="4.65">where the the foot traffic is slowing</text>
  <text start="881.9" dur="4.88">down and the restaurant performance</text>
  <text start="884.21" dur="6.03">benchmark is declining right now and</text>
  <text start="886.78" dur="5.35">what is happening is we have no</text>
  <text start="890.24" dur="4.92">manufacturing or very little bit of</text>
  <text start="892.13" dur="6.69">manufacturing and there are no jobs in</text>
  <text start="895.16" dur="5.88">the u.s. their service type of jobs or</text>
  <text start="898.82" dur="5.4">someone sits behind a great cube with a</text>
  <text start="901.04" dur="5.52">computer and answers emails all day this</text>
  <text start="904.22" dur="4.68">is the major problem and the major</text>
  <text start="906.56" dur="3.87">problem is that most of these statistics</text>
  <text start="908.9" dur="4.86">that are coming out of the government</text>
  <text start="910.43" dur="6.12">out of the Fed they&amp;#39;ve been manipulated</text>
  <text start="913.76" dur="5.31">to make everyone believe that everything</text>
  <text start="916.55" dur="4.98">is great and they&amp;#39;re trying to make the</text>
  <text start="919.07" dur="3.69">case right now of why the Fed doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="921.53" dur="2.82">need to raise interest rates because if</text>
  <text start="922.76" dur="4.32">they start raising interest rates the</text>
  <text start="924.35" dur="4.47">whole thing just comes completely down</text>
  <text start="927.08" dur="3.96">and they know this and they can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="928.82" dur="4.23">anything because everything will be</text>
  <text start="931.04" dur="4.62">blamed on them so they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="933.05" dur="4.98">this off as far as they possibly can and</text>
  <text start="935.66" dur="5.88">while this is happening and again</text>
  <text start="938.03" dur="7.02">anything could you know make this go</text>
  <text start="941.54" dur="4.86">completely implode on itself we see the</text>
  <text start="945.05" dur="6.54">actual economy</text>
  <text start="946.4" dur="8.4">well it&amp;#39;s imploding retail factory</text>
  <text start="951.59" dur="5.46">output the tax receipts coming into the</text>
  <text start="954.8" dur="5.43">government the health insurance industry</text>
  <text start="957.05" dur="5.49">falling apart it&amp;#39;s all falling apart all</text>
  <text start="960.23" dur="4.26">at the same time and they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="962.54" dur="4.74">trouble trying to keep it all together</text>
  <text start="964.49" dur="4.95">and as we move forward it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="967.28" dur="5.13">accelerate as we move into 2018 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="969.44" dur="4.86">just gonna get worse and anything can</text>
  <text start="972.41" dur="3.12">kick off this collapse and this is what</text>
  <text start="974.3" dur="3.99">the central banks are very worried about</text>
  <text start="975.53" dur="5.07">and this is why they&amp;#39;re trying to figure</text>
  <text start="978.29" dur="4.44">out a way to keep everything the way it</text>
  <text start="980.6" dur="4.08">is right now until they can create some</text>
  <text start="982.73" dur="4.56">type of distraction where people say</text>
  <text start="984.68" dur="4.05">look over here it wasn&amp;#39;t us and</text>
  <text start="987.29" dur="3.57">this is what they&amp;#39;ve been putting off</text>
  <text start="988.73" dur="5.789">and they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out a way</text>
  <text start="990.86" dur="5.849">to create this distraction and this is</text>
  <text start="994.519" dur="3.901">something that we all need to watch and</text>
  <text start="996.709" dur="3.151">we can see that they&amp;#39;re trying all</text>
  <text start="998.42" dur="2.94">different ways but I think what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="999.86" dur="3.51">to happen is we&amp;#39;re just gonna head into</text>
  <text start="1001.36" dur="5.06">this collapse and there&amp;#39;s going to be no</text>
  <text start="1003.37" dur="6.149">distraction and this might be the chance</text>
  <text start="1006.42" dur="4.45">where the people can say listen we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1009.519" dur="3.211">need the central banks we have</text>
  <text start="1010.87" dur="3.75">cryptocurrencies we don&amp;#39;t need the</text>

  <text start="1021.94" dur="4.44">so much free money there&amp;#39;s just money</text>
  <text start="1023.92" dur="3.659">created out of thin air that government</text>
  <text start="1026.38" dur="3.78">officials think that they can do</text>
  <text start="1027.579" dur="4.441">anything if there were checks and</text>
  <text start="1030.16" dur="3.929">balances and you had to balance the</text>
