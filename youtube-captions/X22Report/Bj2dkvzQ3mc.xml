  <text start="74.49" dur="5.34">we talked about how China how they were</text>
  <text start="76.83" dur="5.73">locking down the exchanges for the</text>
  <text start="79.83" dur="4.86">cryptocurrency and they were saying that</text>
  <text start="82.56" dur="3.54">they were going to ban trading and what</text>
  <text start="84.69" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="86.1" dur="3.69">lot of confusion now I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="88.26" dur="3.719">this was a report that was put out there</text>
  <text start="89.79" dur="4.23">to scare everyone to bring down the</text>
  <text start="91.979" dur="5.341">price of Bitcoin but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="94.02" dur="6.03">right now is even though allegedly</text>
  <text start="97.32" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re saying that they are planning to</text>
  <text start="100.05" dur="4.62">ban trading a Bitcoin and other virtual</text>

  <text start="109.59" dur="6.66">official in regards to the BAM and</text>
  <text start="112.88" dur="6.04">Russia is out there and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="116.25" dur="5.52">that there&amp;#39;s really no point in banning</text>
  <text start="118.92" dur="4.59">cryptocurrencies now again was this a</text>
  <text start="121.77" dur="3.84">story that was put out there to scare</text>
  <text start="123.51" dur="4.11">everyone we don&amp;#39;t know as of yet but we</text>
  <text start="125.61" dur="4.65">can see right now and we understand that</text>
  <text start="127.62" dur="5.66">certain individuals in countries certain</text>
  <text start="130.26" dur="6.09">central bankers who are running the</text>
  <text start="133.28" dur="5.65">monetary system they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="136.35" dur="4.859">cryptocurrency to be open to be free to</text>
  <text start="138.93" dur="5.52">be decentralized they want control of</text>
  <text start="141.209" dur="6.151">the system completely and this is maybe</text>
  <text start="144.45" dur="5.009">why they decided to come out and put out</text>
  <text start="147.36" dur="3.39">this story to make everyone think that</text>
  <text start="149.459" dur="2.31">oh my God look what&amp;#39;s happening here</text>
  <text start="150.75" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s already being banned in many</text>
  <text start="151.769" dur="3.961">countries we should get out of it but we</text>
  <text start="154.23" dur="3.42">can see right now none of the exchanges</text>
  <text start="155.73" dur="4.44">have actually received any type of</text>
  <text start="157.65" dur="6.24">notification now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="160.17" dur="6.87">is that the Fed is out there and this is</text>
  <text start="163.89" dur="5.069">Fed Reserve governor Lyle Brainard</text>
  <text start="167.04" dur="3.479">he&amp;#39;s out there saying that you know</text>
  <text start="168.959" dur="3.78">let&amp;#39;s take a look at the overall</text>
  <text start="170.519" dur="5.491">everyday average Joe and let&amp;#39;s see how</text>
  <text start="172.739" dur="5.191">they&amp;#39;re really doing and again when we</text>
  <text start="176.01" dur="3.06">think of the economy we think of GDP</text>
  <text start="177.93" dur="2.16">this is what the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="179.07" dur="3.18">pushing out there this is what the</text>
  <text start="180.09" dur="5.459">government is putting out there and when</text>
  <text start="182.25" dur="4.65">we really look at the economy we can see</text>
  <text start="185.549" dur="4.5">that there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="186.9" dur="4.8">of problems in each of the economic</text>
  <text start="190.049" dur="3.27">sectors now they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="191.7" dur="4.19">unemployment they&amp;#39;re looking at GDP</text>
  <text start="193.319" dur="5.221">they&amp;#39;re looking at the stock market and</text>
  <text start="195.89" dur="4.929">what they&amp;#39;re saying is that yes the</text>
  <text start="198.54" dur="4.5">overall the US economy is on solid</text>
  <text start="200.819" dur="4.92">footing we don&amp;#39;t see any type of</text>
  <text start="203.04" dur="4.529">problems and everything looks fantastic</text>
  <text start="205.739" dur="4.381">and of course now we have the</text>
  <text start="207.569" dur="4.5">unemployment rate down very very low but</text>
  <text start="210.12" dur="4.199">what we see happening right here is that</text>
  <text start="212.069" dur="4.681">real wages and salaries they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="214.319" dur="4.26">declining unemployment it is completely</text>
  <text start="216.75" dur="3.959">manipulated if we use the old</text>
  <text start="218.579" dur="3.63">calculation and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="220.709" dur="3.36">shadow stats we can see that</text>
  <text start="222.209" dur="4.65">unemployment is around 20 to 23 percent</text>
  <text start="224.069" dur="6.06">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="226.859" dur="6.33">this is that the ratio of spending to</text>
  <text start="230.129" dur="6.091">income has been very elevated since</text>
  <text start="233.189" dur="5.58">since September 2016 now there have been</text>
  <text start="236.22" dur="5.37">only three extended periods in history</text>
  <text start="238.769" dur="6.87">where the ratio of spending to income</text>
  <text start="241.59" dur="7.08">has exceeded 0.92 this is the month</text>
  <text start="245.639" dur="6.75">surrounding 2001 we know what happened</text>
  <text start="248.67" dur="6.45">in 2001 we had a recession from 2004 to</text>
  <text start="252.389" dur="5.82">the beginning of 2007 well we&amp;#39;ve seen it</text>
  <text start="255.12" dur="4.649">back then and we were in a recession in</text>
  <text start="258.209" dur="4.08">2008 here we are</text>
  <text start="259.769" dur="4.89">since September of 2016 we are seeing</text>
  <text start="262.289" dur="4.921">the same exact thing this tells us that</text>
  <text start="264.659" dur="4.351">something is going on because we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="267.21" dur="3.81">this pattern before now we&amp;#39;ve looked at</text>
  <text start="269.01" dur="5.339">many different patterns and we are</text>
  <text start="271.02" dur="6.179">seeing very similar patterns in each one</text>
  <text start="274.349" dur="4.38">of the economic sectors which shows us</text>
  <text start="277.199" dur="4.231">that we are approaching some type of</text>
  <text start="278.729" dur="6.75">recession and things are not normal now</text>
  <text start="281.43" dur="6.09">personal savings they have hit historic</text>
  <text start="285.479" dur="4.291">lows which tells us another thing all</text>
  <text start="287.52" dur="3.69">these unemployment numbers where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="289.77" dur="3.929">saying we&amp;#39;re at full employment and</text>
  <text start="291.21" dur="7.17">everyone is enjoying this this recovery</text>
  <text start="293.699" dur="6.541">well why aren&amp;#39;t people saving I mean if</text>
  <text start="298.38" dur="2.7">they all have these jobs and everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="300.24" dur="3.239">doing great</text>
  <text start="301.08" dur="3.72">why is these savings rates continually</text>
  <text start="303.479" dur="5.16">falling now we&amp;#39;ve been seeing the</text>
  <text start="304.8" dur="6.989">savings rate continually fall since 1970</text>
  <text start="308.639" dur="7.101">it popped up a little bit around 2008</text>
  <text start="311.789" dur="5.94">2009 2010 and this was the very wealthy</text>
  <text start="315.74" dur="4.66">accumulating a lot of wealth but since</text>
  <text start="317.729" dur="5.521">then we have been on this slide and</text>
  <text start="320.4" dur="4.89">decline slide for a very long time which</text>
  <text start="323.25" dur="4.259">shows that the wealth effect where all</text>
  <text start="325.29" dur="5.79">this wealth is being pushed up to the</text>
  <text start="327.509" dur="5.701">very wealthy and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="331.08" dur="4.589">now is that the American middle-class</text>
  <text start="333.21" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s been running away for decades and</text>
  <text start="335.669" dur="3.391">if we go back in time like I said all</text>
  <text start="337.32" dur="3.719">the way back to the seventies and before</text>
  <text start="339.06" dur="5.31">that before the sixties we can see that</text>
  <text start="341.039" dur="6.211">wages and salary as a percentage of GDP</text>
  <text start="344.37" dur="6.329">is continually falling now think about</text>
  <text start="347.25" dur="6.06">this going back to the 70s the wages and</text>
  <text start="350.699" dur="6.03">salaries as a percent of GDP was around</text>
  <text start="353.31" dur="5.579">fifty fifty one percent or so throughout</text>
  <text start="356.729" dur="5.551">time it has fallen fallen fallen and</text>
  <text start="358.889" dur="5.941">here we are in 2017 and we are down</text>
  <text start="362.28" dur="6.09">around forty three point five percent</text>
  <text start="364.83" dur="5.7">which shows us that something is wrong</text>
  <text start="368.37" dur="4.53">and all throughout this period of time</text>
  <text start="370.53" dur="3.24">yes we had little bump ups but the</text>
  <text start="372.9" dur="4.199">decline</text>
  <text start="373.77" dur="5.73">well it&amp;#39;s continually moving downward</text>
  <text start="377.099" dur="4.681">and we can see that the top point zero</text>
  <text start="379.5" dur="5.34">one percent they have been accumulating</text>
  <text start="381.78" dur="5.19">all this wealth and basically what has</text>
  <text start="384.84" dur="3.9">happened is the bottom 50% of income</text>
  <text start="386.97" dur="3.83">earnings is continually declining and</text>
  <text start="388.74" dur="6.179">the top 1% of income earnings is</text>
  <text start="390.8" dur="6.549">continually increasing so we can see we</text>
  <text start="394.919" dur="4.47">have major problems in the economy the</text>
  <text start="397.349" dur="5.07">wealth is being stolen we can feel it we</text>
  <text start="399.389" dur="5.221">could see it and the economy is not</text>
  <text start="402.419" dur="5.401">doing as well as they want us to believe</text>
  <text start="404.61" dur="5.19">now out in Spain and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot</text>
  <text start="407.82" dur="4.02">of this out in Italy out in Spain in</text>
  <text start="409.8" dur="3.69">Germany where banks are running into</text>
  <text start="411.84" dur="3.329">trouble now remember they have these</text>
  <text start="413.49" dur="3.149">stress tests they want us to believe</text>
  <text start="415.169" dur="3.661">that everything is fine and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="416.639" dur="4.5">finding out is that these banks are in</text>
  <text start="418.83" dur="5.519">trouble they&amp;#39;re having quiet bail-ins</text>
  <text start="421.139" dur="5.161">quiet bailouts and one bank of saving</text>
  <text start="424.349" dur="5.671">another and we see another bank that is</text>
  <text start="426.3" dur="6.839">in trouble in Spain now LIBOR Bank this</text>
  <text start="430.02" dur="5.519">is Spain&amp;#39;s eighth largest lender it was</text>
  <text start="433.139" dur="6.03">spawned in 2011 from the marriage of</text>
  <text start="435.539" dur="5.011">three failed saving banks and now this</text>
  <text start="439.169" dur="3.631">Bank is in trouble</text>
  <text start="440.55" dur="4.109">so we can see with Banco Popular and</text>
  <text start="442.8" dur="3.72">many of the others they&amp;#39;re all running</text>
  <text start="444.659" dur="3.721">into the same exact problems and it</text>
  <text start="446.52" dur="5.34">looks like the domino effect right now</text>
  <text start="448.38" dur="5.84">is happening where each Bank is rolling</text>
  <text start="451.86" dur="4.58">into the other and each one is failing</text>
  <text start="454.22" dur="4.38">yes they can prop them up for a short</text>
  <text start="456.44" dur="4.47">period of time but as time goes on it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.6" dur="5.97">going to get worse and worse we see</text>
  <text start="460.91" dur="7.5">Citibank be Citigroup CFO john ger spock</text>
  <text start="464.57" dur="5.85">he is warning investors that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.41" dur="4.11">problems where they&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="470.42" dur="4.26">revenue now remember revenue and</text>
  <text start="472.52" dur="3.87">earnings two different things revenue is</text>
  <text start="474.68" dur="4.98">going to tumble by fifteen percent in</text>
  <text start="476.39" dur="6.45">the third quarter and it&amp;#39;s not just City</text>
  <text start="479.66" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s many of the other banks now major</text>
  <text start="482.84" dur="3.9">corporations we can see they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="484.58" dur="4.02">revenue coming in yes they&amp;#39;re closing</text>
  <text start="486.74" dur="3.87">different plants that are buying back</text>
  <text start="488.6" dur="4.47">their stocks they&amp;#39;re letting people go</text>
  <text start="490.61" dur="4.65">to make their earnings look much much</text>
  <text start="493.07" dur="4.08">better but sales revenue coming into the</text>
  <text start="495.26" dur="3.66">company this is something you cannot</text>
  <text start="497.15" dur="4.11">hide and they&amp;#39;re already out there</text>
  <text start="498.92" dur="3.96">saying that this is going to drop and</text>
  <text start="501.26" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re going to see revenue drop by 15</text>
  <text start="502.88" dur="5.16">percent deutsche bank is out there and</text>
  <text start="505.7" dur="4.38">the latest from Deutsche Bank&amp;#39;s model</text>
  <text start="508.04" dur="3.87">which looks like the economic data they</text>
  <text start="510.08" dur="4.41">are reporting now and reported on this</text>
  <text start="511.91" dur="4.439">before that we are approaching a</text>
  <text start="514.49" dur="3.75">recession they&amp;#39;re saying the recession</text>
  <text start="516.349" dur="5.431">is going to start within the next 12</text>
  <text start="518.24" dur="5.04">months and we see right now that we are</text>
  <text start="521.78" dur="2.7">definitely running in the problems now</text>
  <text start="523.28" dur="3.54">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all the different</text>
  <text start="524.48" dur="3.51">economic sectors and we&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="526.82" dur="4.53">at these patterns and a lot of them are</text>
  <text start="527.99" dur="6.27">showing that yes we are in trouble now</text>
  <text start="531.35" dur="5.37">one of the more important ones is</text>
  <text start="534.26" dur="3.99">commercial and industrial loans now</text>
  <text start="536.72" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;ve talked about this before we talked</text>
  <text start="538.25" dur="4.68">about many other economic indicators but</text>
  <text start="540.53" dur="4.71">the commercial and industrial loans what</text>
  <text start="542.93" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that this is a</text>
  <text start="545.24" dur="6.15">leading a guaranteed leading indicator</text>
  <text start="548.33" dur="5.46">of future recessions and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="551.39" dur="4.47">seeing right now is the commercial and</text>
  <text start="553.79" dur="3.66">industrial loans they&amp;#39;ve hit a peak and</text>
  <text start="555.86" dur="4.979">they&amp;#39;re starting to come down now if we</text>
  <text start="557.45" dur="4.889">go back to the 90s we saw this happen we</text>
  <text start="560.839" dur="3.961">entered a recession if we go back to</text>
  <text start="562.339" dur="4.761">2000 we hit the same type of peak we</text>
  <text start="564.8" dur="5.22">entered a recession we go back to 2007</text>
  <text start="567.1" dur="3.52">guess what happened in 2008 we went into</text>
  <text start="570.02" dur="3.569">a recession</text>
  <text start="570.62" dur="5.25">here we are right now the pattern looks</text>
  <text start="573.589" dur="5.551">exactly the same and it looks like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="575.87" dur="6.51">moving into that recession period now</text>
  <text start="579.14" dur="5.67">Steve st. Angelo who runs the SRS Roco</text>
  <text start="582.38" dur="5.52">report he&amp;#39;s out there and he&amp;#39;s issued a</text>
  <text start="584.81" dur="6.24">major warning that the markets well</text>
  <text start="587.9" dur="4.79">they could be declining by 85% and he</text>
  <text start="591.05" dur="4.47">goes back in time and he talks about</text>
  <text start="592.69" dur="4.08">well what happened back in 2008 where</text>
  <text start="595.52" dur="3.21">everyone thought the subprime securities</text>
  <text start="596.77" dur="5.02">everything was fine and everything was</text>
  <text start="598.73" dur="5.25">going very very well until it didn&amp;#39;t and</text>
  <text start="601.79" dur="4.89">he says if we look at the central banks</text>
  <text start="603.98" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;ve purchased two trillion in assets</text>
  <text start="606.68" dur="5.43">in 2017 and we looked at this before now</text>
  <text start="609.86" dur="3.95">he said so far in 2017 and we know this</text>
  <text start="612.11" dur="4.59">because we reported on it there&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="613.81" dur="7.05">1.96 trillion of central bank purchases</text>
  <text start="616.7" dur="6.69">of financial assets in 2017 alone</text>
  <text start="620.86" dur="5.35">central bank balance sheets have grown</text>
  <text start="623.39" dur="5.76">by 11 point two six trillion since</text>
  <text start="626.21" dur="4.5">Lehman to fifteen point six trillion now</text>
  <text start="629.15" dur="3.78">we talked about that before now he said</text>
  <text start="630.71" dur="4.11">what is interesting about the nearly two</text>
  <text start="632.93" dur="5.76">trillion and central bank purchases so</text>
  <text start="634.82" dur="7.23">far in 2017 is that the average for each</text>
  <text start="638.69" dur="5.43">year was only about 1.5 trillion which</text>
  <text start="642.05" dur="5.34">can plainly see that the central banks</text>
  <text start="644.12" dur="5.85">had to ramp up their asset purchases as</text>
  <text start="647.39" dur="4.62">the Ponzi scheme seems to be getting out</text>
  <text start="649.97" dur="3.84">of hand so they increased their</text>
  <text start="652.01" dur="3.69">purchases they increase their balance</text>
  <text start="653.81" dur="3.69">sheet they did not shrink their balance</text>
  <text start="655.7" dur="3.93">sheet like they said they were going to</text>
  <text start="657.5" dur="4.89">do now he goes back to Bear Stearns</text>
  <text start="659.63" dur="5.25">during that time period and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="662.39" dur="5.19">that listen a lot of people forgot what</text>
  <text start="664.88" dur="4.65">happened back in 2008 with Bear Stearns</text>
  <text start="667.58" dur="4.2">where the whole thing just fell apart</text>
  <text start="669.53" dur="5.22">where Lehman the whole thing fell apart</text>
  <text start="671.78" dur="5.16">and he said that you know everything is</text>
  <text start="674.75" dur="4.68">fine until it isn&amp;#39;t what they do is they</text>
  <text start="676.94" dur="4.08">keep the illusion alive making you</text>
  <text start="679.43" dur="3.57">believe that everything is fine look</text>
  <text start="681.02" dur="4.08">what they did back in 2008 let&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="683" dur="4.08">forget this time period because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="685.1" dur="3.54">very important not to forget where they</text>
  <text start="687.08" dur="3.78">told that the subprime securities were</text>
  <text start="688.64" dur="4.65">triple-a everything is contained they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="690.86" dur="4.77">not forecasting recession they do this</text>
  <text start="693.29" dur="3.78">on purpose to make everyone believe that</text>
  <text start="695.63" dur="3.33">everything is going to be great</text>
  <text start="697.07" dur="4.64">everything is fine and they&amp;#39;ve done this</text>
  <text start="698.96" dur="6.54">once before now remember Bear Stearns</text>
  <text start="701.71" dur="6.46">they lost around 90 98 percent of its</text>
  <text start="705.5" dur="5.31">stock price in a little bit more than a</text>
  <text start="708.17" dur="4.02">year that&amp;#39;s how fast and how quickly it</text>
  <text start="710.81" dur="4.89">started to fall apart</text>
  <text start="712.19" dur="6.12">Lehman just slows down now he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="715.7" dur="5.189">let&amp;#39;s look at the volatility index which</text>
  <text start="718.31" dur="5.129">is the VIX and let&amp;#39;s see where where</text>
  <text start="720.889" dur="4.86">at right now now this is showing and</text>
  <text start="723.439" dur="4.231">it&amp;#39;s signaling that the big markets</text>
  <text start="725.749" dur="4.83">there are there is trouble ahead</text>
  <text start="727.67" dur="5.399">he says the VIX the volatility index is</text>
  <text start="730.579" dur="6.12">shown to be at its lowest level ever</text>
  <text start="733.069" dur="5.971">when compared to the sp500 index which</text>
  <text start="736.699" dur="4.56">is a told which is at its all-time high</text>
  <text start="739.04" dur="5.31">right now now if we look at the VIX</text>
  <text start="741.259" dur="5.04">index in 2007 it fell to another extreme</text>
  <text start="744.35" dur="4.769">low right at the same time</text>
  <text start="746.299" dur="5.45">Bear Stearns stock price reached a new</text>
  <text start="749.119" dur="5.37">record high of a hundred and seventy one</text>
  <text start="751.749" dur="7.26">isn&amp;#39;t that a neat coincidence he says</text>
  <text start="754.489" dur="7.171">and we&amp;#39;re seeing the exact same pattern</text>
  <text start="759.009" dur="5.77">now everything that we look at is</text>
  <text start="761.66" dur="6.57">pointing to one thing that this economy</text>
  <text start="764.779" dur="5.821">is in major major trouble and we are</text>
  <text start="768.23" dur="4.709">headed down this path where all these</text>
  <text start="770.6" dur="4.919">economic indicators they are pointing to</text>
  <text start="772.939" dur="3.15">the same thing there is economic trouble</text>
  <text start="775.519" dur="3.12">ahead</text>
  <text start="776.089" dur="5.22">I do believe that we are already in a</text>
  <text start="778.639" dur="3.78">recession it started in 2016 and again</text>
  <text start="781.309" dur="2.55">the government the Fed they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="782.419" dur="3.42">to report on this until it&amp;#39;s much much</text>
  <text start="783.859" dur="3.871">later in time where they go back in time</text>
  <text start="785.839" dur="3.87">and say yes it did start during this</text>
  <text start="787.73" dur="3.449">period because we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="789.709" dur="3.48">everything and we can see everything</text>
  <text start="791.179" dur="3.57">that we&amp;#39;ve been saying about the economy</text>
  <text start="793.189" dur="3.45">well it looks like it&amp;#39;s coming true</text>
  <text start="794.749" dur="4.59">where we&amp;#39;re seeing the deterioration of</text>
  <text start="796.639" dur="5.91">retail - the deterioration of house</text>
  <text start="799.339" dur="5.04">housing we seeing that the manipulated</text>
  <text start="802.549" dur="3.84">numbers have completely don&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="804.379" dur="4.5">and these economic indicators are</text>
  <text start="806.389" dur="5.67">pointing to a recession collapse</text>
  <text start="808.879" dur="5.281">scenario so if you haven&amp;#39;t started to</text>
  <text start="812.059" dur="3.63">prepare I would start to prepare now</text>
  <text start="814.16" dur="3.179">because we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of these</text>
  <text start="815.689" dur="5.161">different signs a lot of these warnings</text>
  <text start="817.339" dur="5.37">and if you go back in time to 2006 2007</text>
  <text start="820.85" dur="4.949">there are many people out there saying</text>
  <text start="822.709" dur="5.401">listen we&amp;#39;re heading into a crisis a</text>
  <text start="825.799" dur="3.931">credit crisis a housing crisis and they</text>
  <text start="828.11" dur="4.529">were warning signs all over the place</text>
  <text start="829.73" dur="5.339">the same thing is happening now we are</text>
  <text start="832.639" dur="4.74">heading into this crisis we are being</text>
  <text start="835.069" dur="3.6">warned the universe is whispering in our</text>
  <text start="837.379" dur="4.2">ear get ready</text>
  <text start="838.669" dur="5.28">something bad is about to happen and we</text>
  <text start="841.579" dur="5.04">need to understand that things are</text>
  <text start="843.949" dur="6.18">breaking down I mean remember the dollar</text>
  <text start="846.619" dur="5.19">is dependent on oil because they took</text>
  <text start="850.129" dur="3">the petrodollar they place it on oil and</text>
  <text start="851.809" dur="2.52">what they did is they went through all</text>
  <text start="853.129" dur="3.15">these different countries</text>
  <text start="854.329" dur="4.62">and they made countries purchase oil</text>
  <text start="856.279" dur="4.29">using the dollar well this is starting</text>
  <text start="858.949" dur="4.98">to fault actually it&amp;#39;s not starting it</text>
  <text start="860.569" dur="6">is falling apart and they cannot spread</text>
  <text start="863.929" dur="5.25">this any further what happens when you</text>
  <text start="866.569" dur="4.68">can&amp;#39;t do this anymore and countries</text>
  <text start="869.179" dur="5.421">don&amp;#39;t have to hold the dollar and</text>
  <text start="871.249" dur="7.861">countries decide to take control of</text>
  <text start="874.6" dur="8.56">their natural resources the the way they</text>
  <text start="879.11" dur="6.029">sell their natural resources well no one</text>
  <text start="883.16" dur="3.81">needs the dollar anymore and the dollar</text>
  <text start="885.139" dur="3">comes back to the United States if the</text>
  <text start="886.97" dur="3.299">dollar comes back to the United States</text>
  <text start="888.139" dur="4.56">what happens there are more dollars in</text>
  <text start="890.269" dur="4.41">circulation we see inflation remember</text>
  <text start="892.699" dur="4.711">the central banks have been offloading</text>
  <text start="894.679" dur="4.801">inflation to other countries to other</text>
  <text start="897.41" dur="4.5">areas like the housing market to the</text>
  <text start="899.48" dur="5.849">student loan market to the automobile</text>
  <text start="901.91" dur="5.07">industry to the bond market everywhere</text>
  <text start="905.329" dur="4.11">they could possibly do this they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="906.98" dur="4.829">trying to move it out of the US but when</text>
  <text start="909.439" dur="3.84">these dollars come back we are going to</text>
  <text start="911.809" dur="3.81">see inflation there&amp;#39;s no other way</text>
  <text start="913.279" dur="4.65">around this because countries will not</text>
  <text start="915.619" dur="4.62">need to hold on to it which means that</text>
  <text start="917.929" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s going to come back here the Fed</text>
  <text start="920.239" dur="4.231">where they&amp;#39;ve been creating this</text>
  <text start="921.619" dur="4.741">stimulus same thing with the ECB they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="924.47" dur="3.779">been feeding this into the banks they</text>
  <text start="926.36" dur="3.86">don&amp;#39;t want this money out in circulation</text>
  <text start="928.249" dur="4.74">because they know it would be complete</text>
  <text start="930.22" dur="4.329">catastrophe in the economy and this is</text>
  <text start="932.989" dur="3.301">why they&amp;#39;ve been keeping it in the</text>
  <text start="934.549" dur="4.29">market keeping it within the banks</text>
  <text start="936.29" dur="4.079">keeping it out of the public&amp;#39;s hands</text>
  <text start="938.839" dur="3.66">they don&amp;#39;t want it to reach the public</text>
  <text start="940.369" dur="3.72">hands because that would be there&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="942.499" dur="2.94">dollars in circulation think about the</text>
