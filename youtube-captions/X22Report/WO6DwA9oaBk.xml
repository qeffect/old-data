  <text start="105.09" dur="4.83">don&amp;#39;t see the full plan and sometimes we</text>
  <text start="107.609" dur="4.86">get a little confused when we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="109.92" dur="5.25">at what is going on with the everyday</text>
  <text start="112.469" dur="5.4">events and then when we look back at a</text>
  <text start="115.17" dur="5.43">later time we say oh now that makes</text>
  <text start="117.869" dur="5.341">sense it&amp;#39;s the same with the central</text>
  <text start="120.6" dur="4.979">bank where Trump is continually calling</text>
  <text start="123.21" dur="5.04">out the central bank about raising the</text>
  <text start="125.579" dur="5.191">rates and this has been planned for</text>
  <text start="128.25" dur="6.45">quite a while where they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="130.77" dur="6.9">bring down the economic system and when</text>
  <text start="134.7" dur="5.88">you see the president manipulating the</text>
  <text start="137.67" dur="5.13">data or showing the public that the</text>
  <text start="140.58" dur="5.61">stock market is doing well our</text>
  <text start="142.8" dur="6.57">unemployment numbers are very low GDP</text>
  <text start="146.19" dur="4.83">looks great he&amp;#39;s using the same exact</text>
  <text start="149.37" dur="4.02">method the deep state the central banks</text>
  <text start="151.02" dur="5.34">have been using for quite a while to</text>
  <text start="153.39" dur="3.9">manipulate the entire economy he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="156.36" dur="4.44">this on purpose</text>
  <text start="157.29" dur="4.98">at the same time he&amp;#39;s saying listen the</text>
  <text start="160.8" dur="4.54">Fed shouldn&amp;#39;t be raising the rates now</text>
  <text start="162.27" dur="5.74">in the beginning everyone was</text>
  <text start="165.34" dur="5.34">sizing the president for calling out the</text>
  <text start="168.01" dur="5.43">Fed nobody does this nobody tells the</text>
  <text start="170.68" dur="5.699">Fed what to do and if you listen to</text>
  <text start="173.44" dur="5.879">mainstream media actually when Trump and</text>
  <text start="176.379" dur="4.651">Clinton were running Clinton wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="179.319" dur="4.5">even touch the subject and kind of</text>
  <text start="181.03" dur="5.459">yelled at Trump for even mentioning the</text>
  <text start="183.819" dur="5.851">central bank the reason why Trump is out</text>
  <text start="186.489" dur="6.75">there and he&amp;#39;s continually talking about</text>
  <text start="189.67" dur="6.3">the Fed bringing it up every so often</text>
  <text start="193.239" dur="4.551">contradicting the Fed because he wants</text>
  <text start="195.97" dur="5.91">the people to understand and realize</text>
  <text start="197.79" dur="6.19">they are not gods you&amp;#39;re allowed to</text>
  <text start="201.88" dur="6.48">contradict the Fed you&amp;#39;re allowed to say</text>
  <text start="203.98" dur="6.72">hey what are you doing don&amp;#39;t do this you</text>
  <text start="208.36" dur="5.73">need to do what&amp;#39;s right for the people</text>
  <text start="210.7" dur="5.7">and Trump is using a little bit of</text>
  <text start="214.09" dur="4.83">resort reverse psychology on this whole</text>
  <text start="216.4" dur="4.29">thing where he does where he&amp;#39;s saying he</text>
  <text start="218.92" dur="5.64">doesn&amp;#39;t want the Fed to raise rates but</text>
  <text start="220.69" dur="9.09">in reality he kind of does because this</text>
  <text start="224.56" dur="7.049">allows this system to destroy itself how</text>
  <text start="229.78" dur="5.37">else is this system destroying itself</text>
  <text start="231.609" dur="4.35">well as the Fed raises rates what else</text>
  <text start="235.15" dur="3.75">is happening</text>
  <text start="235.959" dur="5.34">well it&amp;#39;s changing the structure of a</text>
  <text start="238.9" dur="5.79">lot of things I mean look at housing</text>
  <text start="241.299" dur="6.211">look at the retail market look at</text>
  <text start="244.69" dur="8.519">student loans auto loans look at the</text>
  <text start="247.51" dur="11.37">bonds that the Fed is holding to get rid</text>
  <text start="253.209" dur="6.83">of this system you need to use moves and</text>
  <text start="258.88" dur="4.86">countermoves</text>
  <text start="260.039" dur="6.821">to make sure that the Ross trials the</text>
  <text start="263.74" dur="5.37">central bankers are not in power anymore</text>
  <text start="266.86" dur="3.27">remember they&amp;#39;ve been in power for a</text>
  <text start="269.11" dur="3.96">very long time</text>
  <text start="270.13" dur="5.57">they remain in power by corrupting</text>
  <text start="273.07" dur="6.029">governments by paying individuals off</text>
  <text start="275.7" dur="7.66">well that time has come to an end and</text>
  <text start="279.099" dur="7.171">the only way to bring this system to its</text>
  <text start="283.36" dur="6.48">knees is to bring the central bank to</text>
  <text start="286.27" dur="6.06">its knees because it is their system and</text>
  <text start="289.84" dur="5.34">as you can see around the world there</text>
  <text start="292.33" dur="5.04">are many countries that are standing up</text>
  <text start="295.18" dur="3.42">to the elite standing up to the</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="2.58">establishment</text>
  <text start="298.6" dur="3.24">and once again this is why the central</text>
  <text start="299.95" dur="3.93">banks are out there and they&amp;#39;re worried</text>
  <text start="301.84" dur="4.14">about their independence because it</text>
  <text start="303.88" dur="6.23">started out with Trump contradicting the</text>
  <text start="305.98" dur="6.45">Fed and this is flowing across the world</text>
  <text start="310.11" dur="5.8">remember the central banks are in power</text>
  <text start="312.43" dur="5.07">because they stay behind the scenes they</text>
  <text start="315.91" dur="4.56">don&amp;#39;t want anyone to know what is</text>
  <text start="317.5" dur="4.29">happening behind the curtain and what</text>
  <text start="320.47" dur="2.1">they do is they make you look other</text>
  <text start="321.79" dur="3.84">places</text>
  <text start="322.57" dur="5.82">well now we&amp;#39;re looking at them and they</text>
  <text start="325.63" dur="5.01">don&amp;#39;t like it and it scares them and if</text>
  <text start="328.39" dur="6.18">you look at the economy you can see that</text>
  <text start="330.64" dur="7.41">they are trapped right now because let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="334.57" dur="6.84">say they don&amp;#39;t raise rates what happens</text>
  <text start="338.05" dur="5.76">to the economy well Trump could stop</text>
  <text start="341.41" dur="4.98">using the magic wand still blame the Fed</text>
  <text start="343.81" dur="5.07">bring the market down which would pretty</text>
  <text start="346.39" dur="5.82">much destroy the economy the economy is</text>
  <text start="348.88" dur="6.9">built on a complete illusion so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="352.21" dur="6.84">nothing real here when you look at</text>
  <text start="355.78" dur="6.83">housing right now you can see that new</text>
  <text start="359.05" dur="6.24">home existing homes starts they are all</text>
  <text start="362.61" dur="4.54">dropping housing starts are down a</text>
  <text start="365.29" dur="4.68">year-over-year for the second month in a</text>
  <text start="367.15" dur="4.77">row housing starts and building permits</text>
  <text start="369.97" dur="3.99">have gone nowhere in more than two years</text>
  <text start="371.92" dur="5.43">because this is what the central bankers</text>
  <text start="373.96" dur="6.51">had to do they had to keep it just</text>
  <text start="377.35" dur="4.77">barely alive really in limbo because</text>
  <text start="380.47" dur="3.45">they knew they couldn&amp;#39;t go anywhere with</text>
  <text start="382.12" dur="4.02">any of this stuff they couldn&amp;#39;t pump up</text>
  <text start="383.92" dur="5.97">the bubbles everywhere so they had a pic</text>
  <text start="386.14" dur="6.24">select cities to do it in I mean if you</text>
  <text start="389.89" dur="4.02">look out in Vegas right now and we</text>
  <text start="392.38" dur="3.6">talked about this many many times before</text>
  <text start="393.91" dur="5.4">where this was going to spread across</text>
  <text start="395.98" dur="6.21">the country now remember we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="399.31" dur="6">following the economy pointing all this</text>
  <text start="402.19" dur="5.67">out so no one is shocked when this</text>
  <text start="405.31" dur="6.69">economy comes out it didn&amp;#39;t start in</text>
  <text start="407.86" dur="6.9">2016 it didn&amp;#39;t start in 2015 2014 it</text>
  <text start="412" dur="5.67">started all the way back when the Fed</text>
  <text start="414.76" dur="6.24">took control 1913 and then accelerated</text>
  <text start="417.67" dur="5.82">from that time forward and in 2008 it</text>
  <text start="421" dur="6.09">really accelerated like there was no</text>
  <text start="423.49" dur="5.79">tomorrow and since 2008 they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="427.09" dur="4.539">keeping us in this gigantic illusion and</text>
  <text start="429.28" dur="3.729">when you take a look at</text>
  <text start="431.629" dur="4.05">the different cities around the country</text>
  <text start="433.009" dur="5.67">let&amp;#39;s take a look at Vegas for instance</text>
  <text start="435.679" dur="4.35">and I remember going back a couple years</text>
  <text start="438.679" dur="3.66">ago when people said oh my god the</text>
  <text start="440.029" dur="4.47">housing market is booming in Vegas we</text>
  <text start="442.339" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t see any signs of slowdown but in</text>
  <text start="444.499" dur="4.021">the smaller towns in other places around</text>
  <text start="446.149" dur="4.83">the country we did see this and I kept</text>
  <text start="448.52" dur="4.349">mentioning that it hits one place then</text>
  <text start="450.979" dur="3.15">it hits another place and then it hits</text>
  <text start="452.869" dur="6.09">another place and if you remember back</text>
  <text start="454.129" dur="6.51">in 2008 prior to 2008 the West Coast was</text>
  <text start="458.959" dur="3.21">hit in California people were just</text>
  <text start="460.639" dur="4.02">walking out of their homes the East</text>
  <text start="462.169" dur="4.77">Coast traffic started to die and at the</text>
  <text start="464.659" dur="3.96">same time Florida Miami</text>
  <text start="466.939" dur="3.241">well the speculators were still</text>
  <text start="468.619" dur="2.94">speculating and they were still building</text>
  <text start="470.18" dur="3.959">they didn&amp;#39;t see a slowdown until six</text>
  <text start="471.559" dur="4.47">months later well in Vegas right now and</text>
  <text start="474.139" dur="3.51">this is coming from the greater Las</text>
  <text start="476.029" dur="4.2">Vegas Association of Realtors which</text>
  <text start="477.649" dur="6.17">shows 10,000 single-family homes and</text>
  <text start="480.229" dur="8.011">they were on the market and guess what</text>
  <text start="483.819" dur="9.88">by the end of November 7,000 of those</text>
  <text start="488.24" dur="7.829">homes had zero offers up 54% compared to</text>
  <text start="493.699" dur="4.92">2017 and the highest number of homes Las</text>
  <text start="496.069" dur="5.69">Vegas Valley to not get a bid in more</text>
  <text start="498.619" dur="7.23">than two years that tells you something</text>
  <text start="501.759" dur="7">it tells you something is wrong the</text>
  <text start="505.849" dur="7.401">market is turning in the opposite</text>
  <text start="508.759" dur="8.43">direction and there&amp;#39;s a reason for this</text>
  <text start="513.25" dur="7.089">the entire housing market was built on</text>
  <text start="517.189" dur="5.48">an illusion those people that purchased</text>
  <text start="520.339" dur="4.61">in the market when it was at the highest</text>
  <text start="522.669" dur="4.36">they&amp;#39;re gonna have trouble selling</text>
  <text start="524.949" dur="4.151">because the prices are gonna start to</text>
  <text start="527.029" dur="6.24">drop now it&amp;#39;s almost the same thing that</text>
  <text start="529.1" dur="5.429">we saw back in 2007 going into 2008 if</text>
  <text start="533.269" dur="5.701">you bought at the height of the market</text>
  <text start="534.529" dur="6.391">and you held on to it all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="538.97" dur="3.799">housing prices started to decline and</text>
  <text start="540.92" dur="3.96">people couldn&amp;#39;t get rid of the houses</text>
  <text start="542.769" dur="4">the same thing is happening right now</text>
  <text start="544.88" dur="3.24">and this is not going to be a pretty</text>
  <text start="546.769" dur="5.581">picture when all this starts to fall</text>
  <text start="548.12" dur="8.069">apart but the plan is the plan is to</text>
  <text start="552.35" dur="7.38">push the economy to the edge while</text>
  <text start="556.189" dur="5.281">having a back-up plan to make sure that</text>
  <text start="559.73" dur="4.709">there&amp;#39;s something waiting in the wings</text>
  <text start="561.47" dur="4.17">and it&amp;#39;s not a central bank economy if</text>
  <text start="564.439" dur="2.421">the central bankers weren&amp;#39;t in</text>
  <text start="565.64" dur="3.9">trollin they control the narrative</text>
  <text start="566.86" dur="4.93">they&amp;#39;d be setting up the next Central</text>
  <text start="569.54" dur="4.44">Bank economy they wouldn&amp;#39;t care how many</text>
  <text start="571.79" dur="6.12">people got hurt how many people went</text>
  <text start="573.98" dur="5.94">bankrupt but this is designed so people</text>
  <text start="577.91" dur="3.12">do not get hurt yes you&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="579.92" dur="2.85">get prepared because there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="581.03" dur="4.11">a transition period it&amp;#39;s gonna be very</text>
  <text start="582.77" dur="4.5">very bumpy for many some it might be a</text>
  <text start="585.14" dur="3.84">little bit smoother but there is going</text>
  <text start="587.27" dur="3.42">to be a transition period do I think</text>
  <text start="588.98" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s gonna be a Mad Max type of scenario</text>
  <text start="590.69" dur="4.77">not anymore I think the Patriots are in</text>
  <text start="592.91" dur="4.32">control I think they&amp;#39;re preparing and</text>
  <text start="595.46" dur="3.72">getting ready to make this move and</text>
  <text start="597.23" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;ve been preparing for a very long</text>
  <text start="599.18" dur="4.71">time and as cue has been saying gold is</text>
  <text start="602.48" dur="2.85">going to be used to take down the Fed</text>
  <text start="603.89" dur="5.28">but that&amp;#39;s not the only weapon they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="605.33" dur="5.58">using they&amp;#39;re using interest rates now</text>
  <text start="609.17" dur="3.93">think about this this is coming out of</text>
  <text start="610.91" dur="4.58">sovereign man a decade ago</text>
  <text start="613.1" dur="4.74">during the 2008 global financial crisis</text>
  <text start="615.49" dur="5.2">central banks around the world created</text>
  <text start="617.84" dur="5.07">trillions of dollars euros yen worth of</text>
  <text start="620.69" dur="4.35">currency and effectively gave it all the</text>
  <text start="622.91" dur="4.71">way to their respective governments and</text>
  <text start="625.04" dur="6.29">commercial banks the US Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="627.62" dur="6.69">conjured up around what four trillion</text>
  <text start="631.33" dur="5.41">dollars completely out of thin air and</text>
  <text start="634.31" dur="4.62">loaned most of it to the federal</text>
  <text start="636.74" dur="5.85">government and at record low interest</text>
  <text start="638.93" dur="7.53">rates but here&amp;#39;s the weird part if you</text>
  <text start="642.59" dur="7.5">remember that inviolable law of bond</text>
  <text start="646.46" dur="7.35">prices when interest rates go up bond</text>
  <text start="650.09" dur="6.27">prices fall and that&amp;#39;s exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="653.81" dur="4.77">been happening the Fed bought trillions</text>
  <text start="656.36" dur="3.6">of dollars worth of government bonds at</text>
  <text start="658.58" dur="4.56">a time when the interest rates were to</text>
  <text start="659.96" dur="5.93">add at historic lows then starting about</text>
  <text start="663.14" dur="5.19">say about two years ago the Fed began</text>
  <text start="665.89" dur="5.05">slowly slowly raising the interest rates</text>
  <text start="668.33" dur="4.86">now remember their plan was a little</text>
  <text start="670.94" dur="4.05">different they were gonna raise the</text>
  <text start="673.19" dur="6.33">interest rates to bring the economy down</text>
  <text start="674.99" dur="8.49">and to cover this up they were going to</text>
  <text start="679.52" dur="6.69">have an event because central bankers</text>
  <text start="683.48" dur="4.59">don&amp;#39;t leave anything to chance they want</text>
  <text start="686.21" dur="3">to be in complete control and many</text>
  <text start="688.07" dur="3.45">people say well why don&amp;#39;t they just let</text>
  <text start="689.21" dur="6.45">it crash by itself no they want to</text>
  <text start="691.52" dur="7.05">control the crash and they do it on</text>
  <text start="695.66" dur="5.01">purpose because they always want control</text>
  <text start="698.57" dur="5.7">but they don&amp;#39;t have this plan anymore</text>
  <text start="700.67" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s out the window so as the Fed right</text>
  <text start="704.27" dur="5.96">now as they continually raise interest</text>
  <text start="706.31" dur="8.88">rates it will eventually engineer its</text>
  <text start="710.23" dur="7.51">insolvency it&amp;#39;s happening now the Fed</text>
  <text start="715.19" dur="4.74">released its latest quarterly financial</text>
  <text start="717.74" dur="4.08">statements showing that the value of</text>
  <text start="719.93" dur="5.79">their bonds is now sixty six point five</text>
  <text start="721.82" dur="6.99">billion less than what they paid and if</text>
  <text start="725.72" dur="8.64">they keep doing this it will bring down</text>
  <text start="728.81" dur="8.49">the Fed now they know this they know</text>
  <text start="734.36" dur="6.48">that this is going to happen but they</text>
  <text start="737.3" dur="6.27">were expecting an event now I do believe</text>
  <text start="740.84" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;re continually doing this and this</text>
  <text start="743.57" dur="6.45">is part of the plan with Trump Patriots</text>
  <text start="747.5" dur="5.19">and I do believe Powell is included in</text>
  <text start="750.02" dur="7.19">this where they&amp;#39;re trying to bring down</text>
  <text start="752.69" dur="8.52">the central bank from every direction</text>
  <text start="757.21" dur="6.61">they&amp;#39;re not taking a chance they want to</text>
  <text start="761.21" dur="5.49">make sure that this system is brought</text>
  <text start="763.82" dur="6.6">down and there is no way to save it at</text>
  <text start="766.7" dur="6.45">all and then once they have the fed</text>
  <text start="770.42" dur="8.67">where they want it throw on top of that</text>
  <text start="773.15" dur="8.34">gold boom brings down the Fed so you can</text>
  <text start="779.09" dur="4.41">see that there are many plans going on</text>
  <text start="781.49" dur="3.57">there are many things that are happening</text>
  <text start="783.5" dur="4.98">there are many moves that are happening</text>
  <text start="785.06" dur="6.21">behind the scenes and tomorrow the Fed</text>
  <text start="788.48" dur="4.98">is going to decide whether they should</text>
  <text start="791.27" dur="3.86">raise rates or lower rates many people</text>
  <text start="793.46" dur="4.17">saying they&amp;#39;re going to raise rates</text>
  <text start="795.13" dur="5.44">Trump is going to get very angry if they</text>
  <text start="797.63" dur="4.89">do or when they do and he&amp;#39;s gonna lash</text>
  <text start="800.57" dur="3.84">out at the Fed saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="802.52" dur="3.84">blowing up the economy they&amp;#39;re making</text>
