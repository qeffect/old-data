  <text start="43.489" dur="6.181">full-blown collapse let&amp;#39;s get right into</text>
  <text start="46.4" dur="6.659">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="49.67" dur="5.279">as we can see the market was pushed up a</text>
  <text start="53.059" dur="6.631">little bit closing around a hundred</text>
  <text start="54.949" dur="6.721">points or so gold rebounded and it looks</text>
  <text start="59.69" dur="5.88">like it moved up about twenty dollars</text>
  <text start="61.67" dur="7.29">today and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the</text>
  <text start="65.57" dur="5.64">market fluctuate on its top we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="68.96" dur="7.47">gold continually suppressed that pops</text>
  <text start="71.21" dur="8.85">back up and when gold starts to rise not</text>
  <text start="76.43" dur="5.7">by twenty dollars but by like 75 100 150</text>
  <text start="80.06" dur="6.239">and they try to suppress that that is a</text>
  <text start="82.13" dur="6.45">signal that they are losing control but</text>
  <text start="86.299" dur="6.631">what we&amp;#39;re seeing around the world is</text>
  <text start="88.58" dur="7.349">the economies are all deteriorating if</text>
  <text start="92.93" dur="5.729">we go after Japan Japan retail sales</text>
  <text start="95.929" dur="5.071">they have plunged most since 2010 this</text>
  <text start="98.659" dur="5.25">is the fourth monthly decline in a row</text>
  <text start="101" dur="5.189">for retail sales now of course they had</text>
  <text start="103.909" dur="6.09">the tax hikes which did not help and</text>
  <text start="106.189" dur="8.96">when we look and that was back in 2014</text>
  <text start="109.999" dur="8.72">and when we look we see going forward</text>
  <text start="115.149" dur="8.83">Japan is not improving their just</text>
  <text start="118.719" dur="7.241">limping along if we look at other</text>
  <text start="123.979" dur="4.801">economies around the world throughout</text>
  <text start="125.96" dur="5.16">Europe we see most of the countries are</text>
  <text start="128.78" dur="6.6">in a huge amount of debt unemployment is</text>
  <text start="131.12" dur="7.5">going up in France people are finding it</text>
  <text start="135.38" dur="6.24">harder and harder to survive and things</text>
  <text start="138.62" dur="5.13">at this point don&amp;#39;t look any better that</text>
  <text start="141.62" dur="4.74">we see Australia the housing bubble is</text>
  <text start="143.75" dur="4.95">popping in Canada the housing bubble is</text>
  <text start="146.36" dur="4.62">popping yes there are small pockets in</text>
  <text start="148.7" dur="4.59">areas where foreign investors are coming</text>
  <text start="150.98" dur="3.99">in trying to purchase as much real</text>
  <text start="153.29" dur="3.54">estate as possible which is pushing the</text>
  <text start="154.97" dur="4.89">prices up we see that here in real</text>
  <text start="156.83" dur="5.07">estate in the United States also but</text>
  <text start="159.86" dur="3.18">when we look around we see at this point</text>
  <text start="161.9" dur="3.99">that</text>
  <text start="163.04" dur="4.979">things are deteriorating very very</text>
  <text start="165.89" dur="5.129">quickly all the economic indicators that</text>
  <text start="168.019" dur="4.771">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at show this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="171.019" dur="4.981">signaling us that we&amp;#39;re in a recession</text>
  <text start="172.79" dur="5.46">moving into a depression and when we</text>
  <text start="176" dur="6.09">look at all the economic data it is</text>
  <text start="178.25" dur="6.299">worse than two thousand eight now the US</text>
  <text start="182.09" dur="5.22">government central bankers have created</text>
  <text start="184.549" dur="4.44">bubbles in many of the areas a lot of</text>
  <text start="187.31" dur="5.28">the areas where there&amp;#39;s real estate and</text>
  <text start="188.989" dur="6.211">it&amp;#39;s booming these are bubble areas the</text>
  <text start="192.59" dur="5.25">rest of the United States is not doing</text>
  <text start="195.2" dur="4.619">as well now can they do this and for the</text>
  <text start="197.84" dur="4.349">entire country no they pick out certain</text>
  <text start="199.819" dur="7.59">areas and when I looked around today I</text>
  <text start="202.189" dur="9.42">see that housing prices in the US they</text>
  <text start="207.409" dur="6.69">are falling houses are on the market</text>
  <text start="211.609" dur="4.891">longer and longer I looked in upstate</text>
  <text start="214.099" dur="4.771">New York I looked in North Carolina and</text>
  <text start="216.5" dur="5.37">if you just go on zillow and do a little</text>
  <text start="218.87" dur="6.63">bit of research you will see that many</text>
  <text start="221.87" dur="5.069">of the homes that are for sale have been</text>
  <text start="225.5" dur="2.729">on the market they take them off the</text>
  <text start="226.939" dur="3.601">market they put them back on the market</text>
  <text start="228.229" dur="6.241">they lower the price and this is</text>
  <text start="230.54" dur="7.379">spreading throughout the country and as</text>
  <text start="234.47" dur="6.15">time goes on this will spread into the</text>
  <text start="237.919" dur="5.79">other areas this is what we saw back in</text>
  <text start="240.62" dur="6.72">two thousand eight where New York the</text>
  <text start="243.709" dur="6.39">Upstate region there was hurting but</text>
  <text start="247.34" dur="5.299">down in Florida things were proving</text>
  <text start="250.099" dur="5.04">people were shopping real estate was</text>
  <text start="252.639" dur="4.69">selling very well speculators were</text>
  <text start="255.139" dur="5.9">coming in and then six to eight months</text>
  <text start="257.329" dur="7.231">later guess what it all came to an end</text>
  <text start="261.039" dur="7.781">it&amp;#39;s an illusion to convince you</text>
  <text start="264.56" dur="6.57">everything is fine and this illusion is</text>
  <text start="268.82" dur="7.349">going to come to an end very very soon</text>
  <text start="271.13" dur="8.25">now Russia has become the top gold buyer</text>
  <text start="276.169" dur="5.37">in February they purchased about three</text>
  <text start="279.38" dur="3.87">hundred fifty six thousand ounces the</text>
  <text start="281.539" dur="3.5">largest buyer of the precious metal</text>
  <text start="283.25" dur="7.82">among the world&amp;#39;s central banks and</text>
  <text start="285.039" dur="11.081">Saudi Arabia right now they are losing</text>
  <text start="291.07" dur="5.45">nine of the 15 top markets where they</text>
  <text start="296.12" dur="5.47">supply</text>
  <text start="296.52" dur="8.25">I crude oil according to the analysis</text>
  <text start="301.59" dur="6.69">the kingdom lost ground in China South</text>
  <text start="304.77" dur="6.84">Africa and the u.s. between twenty 20</text>
  <text start="308.28" dur="5.789">2013 and 2015 over the past five years</text>
  <text start="311.61" dur="4.5">Russia&amp;#39;s exports to China have more than</text>
  <text start="314.069" dur="4.051">doubled increasing by five hundred and</text>
  <text start="316.11" dur="4.26">fifty thousand barrels a day Russia</text>
  <text start="318.12" dur="4.65">surpassed Saudi Arabia as the biggest</text>
  <text start="320.37" dur="6.06">crude exported to China in four months</text>
  <text start="322.77" dur="6.09">during 2015 so these lower prices aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="326.43" dur="5.22">really helping Saudi Arabia whatsoever</text>
  <text start="328.86" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s actually hurting Saudi Arabia right</text>
  <text start="331.65" dur="6.54">now now here in the United States the US</text>
  <text start="334.74" dur="6.72">government The Conference Board which is</text>
  <text start="338.19" dur="5.699">a paid board to look at consumer</text>
  <text start="341.46" dur="5.25">confidence by the government they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="343.889" dur="5.551">trying to convince us that consumer</text>
  <text start="346.71" dur="8.549">confidence has increased by 96.2 in</text>
  <text start="349.44" dur="10.259">march from 94 the month earlier and when</text>
  <text start="355.259" dur="7.171">you look at what the people consumer</text>
  <text start="359.699" dur="7.381">confidence is that&amp;#39;s gallop it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="362.43" dur="6.57">completely the opposite now gallop goes</text>
  <text start="367.08" dur="5.16">out and does a survey among the people</text>
  <text start="369" dur="5.43">and they find out okay how do you feel</text>
  <text start="372.24" dur="5.07">about the economy how do you think the</text>
  <text start="374.43" dur="6.269">economy is doing and what we find out is</text>
  <text start="377.31" dur="6.389">the US economic confidence index dropped</text>
  <text start="380.699" dur="5.911">by 13 for the week ending March 27th the</text>
  <text start="383.699" dur="5.97">scores down from negative 9 the previous</text>
  <text start="386.61" dur="6.809">week and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="389.669" dur="6.18">a discrepancy as we always see we see</text>
  <text start="393.419" dur="4.62">the government out there spewing that</text>
  <text start="395.849" dur="4.5">the economy is absolutely fine and</text>
  <text start="398.039" dur="5.461">perfect and then we have a gallup poll</text>
  <text start="400.349" dur="6.301">which is surveying people and their poll</text>
  <text start="403.5" dur="5.539">shows the actual opposite so something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="406.65" dur="9">wrong here something is not right</text>
  <text start="409.039" dur="9.81">someone is lying now case-shiller they</text>
  <text start="415.65" dur="5.759">have come out with their home prices and</text>
  <text start="418.849" dur="5.261">they looked at 20 different cities and</text>
  <text start="421.409" dur="4.411">they&amp;#39;re saying that us home prices rose</text>
  <text start="424.11" dur="5.339">by five point seven five percent</text>
  <text start="425.82" dur="4.53">year-on-year and like I said earlier I</text>
  <text start="429.449" dur="3.841">look around</text>
  <text start="430.35" dur="4.65">the country in many different areas yes</text>
  <text start="433.29" dur="4.8">there&amp;#39;s a lot of speculating going on</text>
  <text start="435" dur="5.04">out in the real estate market but for</text>
  <text start="438.09" dur="4.65">those people who are trying to sell</text>
  <text start="440.04" dur="8.07">their homes at this point and get into a</text>
  <text start="442.74" dur="7.77">larger home it&amp;#39;s not happening these</text>
  <text start="448.11" dur="5.85">houses and i&amp;#39;m looking at upstate new</text>
  <text start="450.51" dur="5.76">york i&amp;#39;m looking in the North Carolina</text>
  <text start="453.96" dur="4.83">South Carolina area I&amp;#39;m looking in the</text>
  <text start="456.27" dur="4.89">Midwest out west now yes there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="458.79" dur="5.48">to be pockets of areas where there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="461.16" dur="5.85">going to be a booming real estate and</text>
  <text start="464.27" dur="6.88">there&amp;#39;s going to be in the same areas</text>
  <text start="467.01" dur="6.02">where things aren&amp;#39;t selling at all now</text>
  <text start="471.15" dur="5.18">those people are selling their houses</text>
  <text start="473.03" dur="6.91">when I looked on zillow and other</text>
  <text start="476.33" dur="7.24">websites i see that houses have been on</text>
  <text start="479.94" dur="6.39">the market five six seven months and the</text>
  <text start="483.57" dur="6.3">prices have been slashed 10,000 20,000</text>
  <text start="486.33" dur="7.16">30,000 dollars because they cannot move</text>
  <text start="489.87" dur="7.32">these houses now I remember prior to</text>
  <text start="493.49" dur="7.86">2007 when real estate was really booming</text>
  <text start="497.19" dur="8.43">a house would stay on the market for</text>
  <text start="501.35" dur="6.7">about two weeks that&amp;#39;s it three at the</text>
  <text start="505.62" dur="7.5">most and will be sold off and the price</text>
  <text start="508.05" dur="7.2">would go up as the markets load going</text>
  <text start="513.12" dur="5.58">into to south 2007 going to two thousand</text>
  <text start="515.25" dur="5.46">eight houses were on the market longer</text>
  <text start="518.7" dur="4.95">and longer and people didn&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="520.71" dur="7.41">what was going on and I saw prices level</text>
  <text start="523.65" dur="6.33">off I saw them drop and as no tres the</text>
  <text start="528.12" dur="3.81">traffic dried up prices dropped even</text>
  <text start="529.98" dur="5.13">further people took the houses off the</text>
  <text start="531.93" dur="6">market we listed about a month later try</text>
  <text start="535.11" dur="6.42">it again it didn&amp;#39;t work we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="537.93" dur="5.76">same thing happened once again the</text>
  <text start="541.53" dur="7.2">illusion that the central bankers have</text>
  <text start="543.69" dur="8.01">created is rapidly falling apart and we</text>
  <text start="548.73" dur="5.94">can see outside of these bubble areas</text>
  <text start="551.7" dur="4.92">that they&amp;#39;re only looking at things are</text>
  <text start="554.67" dur="6.23">rapidly deteriorating very very quickly</text>
  <text start="556.62" dur="7.24">and this is going to continually spread</text>
  <text start="560.9" dur="6.23">to other regions of the country</text>
  <text start="563.86" dur="7.8">and it will hit your region eventually</text>
  <text start="567.13" dur="7.32">just like in 2008 but this time it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="571.66" dur="6.39">going to be much worse now corporate</text>
  <text start="574.45" dur="6.96">defaults they are skyrocketing at this</text>
  <text start="578.05" dur="5.99">point there is a wave of bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="581.41" dur="5.48">which is sweeping the energy industry</text>
  <text start="584.04" dur="7.75">but it&amp;#39;s not just the energy industry</text>
  <text start="586.89" dur="6.4">it&amp;#39;s many other areas in fact the</text>
  <text start="591.79" dur="4.41">average credit rating for u.s.</text>
  <text start="593.29" dur="5.729">corporation is now lower than it was at</text>
  <text start="596.2" dur="5.37">any point during the last recession this</text>
  <text start="599.019" dur="8.661">is yet another sign that we&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="601.57" dur="10.86">early stages of a major economic crisis</text>
  <text start="607.68" dur="7.27">the 2016 to date total is now 31 the</text>
  <text start="612.43" dur="4.77">highest since 2009 when there were 42</text>
  <text start="614.95" dur="5.46">company defaults and this is according</text>
  <text start="617.2" dur="6.509">to standard &amp;amp; poor&amp;#39;s what all of this</text>
  <text start="620.41" dur="6.929">tells us is that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="623.709" dur="6.451">melting down at this point and as time</text>
  <text start="627.339" dur="6.451">goes on we&amp;#39;re going to see this</text>
  <text start="630.16" dur="6.81">accelerate because the real economic</text>
  <text start="633.79" dur="4.62">indicators that we&amp;#39;ve been studying that</text>
  <text start="636.97" dur="3.809">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="638.41" dur="5.07">tracking are completely separate and</text>
  <text start="640.779" dur="4.351">apart from the government numbers now</text>
  <text start="643.48" dur="5.25">remember the government likes to</text>
  <text start="645.13" dur="6.42">manipulate massage lie about what is</text>
  <text start="648.73" dur="5.549">really going on actually I remember back</text>
  <text start="651.55" dur="7.349">in 2008 they really wouldn&amp;#39;t even admit</text>
  <text start="654.279" dur="8.071">that things were falling apart and that</text>
  <text start="658.899" dur="5.581">was an August going into September the</text>
  <text start="662.35" dur="3.63">corporate media would say yeah it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="664.48" dur="4.77">little bit of slow down but don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="665.98" dur="6.539">the economy this size cannot crash at</text>

  <text start="672.519" dur="3.56">we&amp;#39;ve never seen that happen to just not</text>
  <text start="674.829" dur="3.301">going to happen don&amp;#39;t worry about it</text>
  <text start="676.079" dur="5.111">people are not going to lose their jobs</text>

  <text start="681.19" dur="6.42">turned out to be not fine everything</text>
  <text start="684.25" dur="6.6">crashed and even during the crash they</text>
  <text start="687.61" dur="8.459">said the whole entire crash was going to</text>
  <text start="690.85" dur="6.72">be fixed by the spring of 2009 which it</text>
  <text start="696.069" dur="2.911">wasn&amp;#39;t actually</text>

  <text start="757.9" dur="4.92">to raise interest rates they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="760.6" dur="3.9">have to come up with one doozy of an</text>
  <text start="762.82" dur="3.24">excuse and I don&amp;#39;t think they have one</text>
  <text start="764.5" dur="3.83">at this point in time because the</text>

  <text start="768.33" dur="5.32">Obama the corporate media is out there</text>

  <text start="782.2" dur="5.22">interest rates well the only reason this</text>
  <text start="784.99" dur="6.66">would happen is if there is some type of</text>

  <text start="795.37" dur="7.59">happens cyber attack physical attack</text>
  <text start="797.8" dur="7.26">things in that nature now David Stockman</text>
  <text start="802.96" dur="4.59">is saying as soon as the markets</text>
  <text start="805.06" dur="6.03">realized the Fed in the ECB are out of</text>
  <text start="807.55" dur="7.83">ammunition it&amp;#39;s completely over and he</text>
  <text start="811.09" dur="9.06">says we&amp;#39;re almost there the world right</text>
  <text start="815.38" dur="8.16">now is extremely unsafe and we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="820.15" dur="7.74">seen anything like this before because</text>
  <text start="823.54" dur="6.22">the world the world economy is drifting</text>
  <text start="827.89" dur="4.93">into a recession</text>
  <text start="829.76" dur="6.15">and we are not decoupled we are not</text>
  <text start="832.82" dur="5.88">exempt we&amp;#39;re still in no man&amp;#39;s land</text>
  <text start="835.91" dur="5.82">we&amp;#39;ve had a dead cat bounce it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="838.7" dur="8.04">strong the only thing left is to bury</text>
  <text start="841.73" dur="8.19">the cat and we can see at this point we</text>
  <text start="846.74" dur="5.52">are headed down a path from everything</text>
  <text start="849.92" dur="5.28">that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all the</text>
  <text start="852.26" dur="7.98">economic indicators GDP manufacturing</text>
  <text start="855.2" dur="12.21">retail housing spending it&amp;#39;s all coming</text>
  <text start="860.24" dur="11.25">apart very quickly now Obamacare it is a</text>
  <text start="867.41" dur="8.34">complete and utter disaster they have</text>
  <text start="871.49" dur="7.95">missed their projection by 24 million</text>
  <text start="875.75" dur="5.64">people an average of about 200 + 1</text>
  <text start="879.44" dur="4.05">million people have private health</text>
  <text start="881.39" dur="6.96">insurance in every in any given month of</text>
  <text start="883.49" dur="7.02">2016 now the 2016 is here the CBO says</text>
  <text start="888.35" dur="3.93">that just 177 million people on average</text>
  <text start="890.51" dur="4.05">will have private health insurance in</text>
  <text start="892.28" dur="4.41">any given month of this year a shortfall</text>
  <text start="894.56" dur="4.29">of 24 million people now remember all</text>
  <text start="896.69" dur="3.78">these people just didn&amp;#39;t elect Obama</text>
  <text start="898.85" dur="5.63">care a lot of them have health insurance</text>
  <text start="900.47" dur="6.81">through companies so we can see that</text>
  <text start="904.48" dur="4.39">Obamacare has actually reduced the</text>
  <text start="907.28" dur="8.16">number of people with private health</text>
  <text start="908.87" dur="8.13">insurance this is a failure and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="915.44" dur="3.12">very interesting is the congressional</text>
  <text start="917" dur="3.6">budget office projects millions of</text>
  <text start="918.56" dur="4.29">workers will leave employer-sponsored</text>
  <text start="920.6" dur="5.19">health plans over the next decade</text>
  <text start="922.85" dur="4.44">because of Obamacare some will opt out</text>
  <text start="925.79" dur="3.45">to go to Medicaid but others will be</text>
  <text start="927.29" dur="4.29">kicked off their company plans by</text>
  <text start="929.24" dur="7.41">employers who decide not to offer</text>
  <text start="931.58" dur="7.38">coverage anymore now I think what is</text>
  <text start="936.65" dur="4.68">happening here is this is part of</text>
  <text start="938.96" dur="4.65">Obamacare&amp;#39;s plan because remember when</text>
  <text start="941.33" dur="4.68">they do something it&amp;#39;s not to benefit</text>
  <text start="943.61" dur="5.67">the people it&amp;#39;s the benefit who the</text>
  <text start="946.01" dur="6.54">corporation&amp;#39;s the government the central</text>
  <text start="949.28" dur="6.84">bank and not the people and when we look</text>
  <text start="952.55" dur="7.83">at this we see what is the motivation</text>
  <text start="956.12" dur="5.31">for Obamacare well it&amp;#39;s to bring in lots</text>
  <text start="960.38" dur="2.76">of funds to the health insurance</text>
  <text start="961.43" dur="2.14">companies to bring in tax revenue to the</text>
  <text start="963.14" dur="4.72">government</text>
  <text start="963.57" dur="9.51">and to give benefits to the corporations</text>
  <text start="967.86" dur="8.73">and if corporations push people through</text>
  <text start="973.08" dur="6.14">Obamacare out of health plans the people</text>
  <text start="976.59" dur="5.79">have to make up the difference the</text>
  <text start="979.22" dur="6.67">corporation is off the hook they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="982.38" dur="8.16">have to make those payments and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="985.89" dur="6.72">easy to get past that penalty all they</text>
  <text start="990.54" dur="4.08">need to do is cut hours cut the number</text>
  <text start="992.61" dur="4.02">of employees which they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="994.62" dur="3.6">anyway because the whole entire economy</text>
  <text start="996.63" dur="4.23">is falling apart and when we look</text>
  <text start="998.22" dur="7.91">closely at Obamacare we can see that</text>
  <text start="1000.86" dur="7.92">this is all part of the plan to benefit</text>
  <text start="1006.13" dur="4.66">corporations to benefit the health</text>
  <text start="1008.78" dur="4.38">insurance companies to benefit the</text>
  <text start="1010.79" dur="6.53">central bank to benefit the government</text>
  <text start="1013.16" dur="6.21">and to give no benefit to the people</text>
  <text start="1017.32" dur="4.21">listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
  <text start="1019.37" dur="5.66">listening be well be safe and especially</text>
