  <text start="534.269" dur="7.26">the cash to purchase these homes so what</text>
  <text start="538.05" dur="5.82">did they do well they revised the august</text>
  <text start="541.529" dur="6.891">numbers and they brought him down then</text>
  <text start="543.87" dur="9.92">they took the September numbers and they</text>

  <text start="573.56" dur="6.15">they manipulate they added so much into</text>
  <text start="577.1" dur="8.42">this that they brought it up to four</text>
  <text start="579.71" dur="7.74">point seven five it&amp;#39;s a complete</text>

  <text start="590.39" dur="5.27">applications are continually declining</text>
  <text start="591.82" dur="6.67">yes we see a few bump ups but when you</text>
  <text start="595.66" dur="6.06">zoom out and you take a big picture of</text>
  <text start="598.49" dur="7.26">what&amp;#39;s really going on you see that</text>
  <text start="601.72" dur="8.92">these numbers are in a downward</text>
  <text start="605.75" dur="8.1">trajectory mortgage applications are</text>
  <text start="610.64" dur="7.02">falling which means houses aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="613.85" dur="8.22">selling which means we&amp;#39;re in big trouble</text>
  <text start="617.66" dur="9.39">here and like I said yesterday we are</text>
  <text start="622.07" dur="6.36">well past a depression right now and it</text>
  <text start="627.05" dur="5.76">looks like the government is keeping</text>
  <text start="628.43" dur="6.72">this together with tape glue spit I got</text>
  <text start="632.81" dur="5.94">this finger in the dam of a toe in the</text>
  <text start="635.15" dur="6.48">dam and they can&amp;#39;t explain all of this</text>
  <text start="638.75" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s happening right now and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="641.63" dur="5.37">getting nervous and worried that this</text>
  <text start="643.43" dur="6">might come down on its own but everyone</text>
  <text start="647" dur="4.74">look at the stock market because they</text>
  <text start="649.43" dur="4.61">have full control over that they have</text>
  <text start="651.74" dur="7.71">full control of what the market does and</text>
  <text start="654.04" dur="8.79">this is all they have left and they want</text>
  <text start="659.45" dur="6.3">everyone looking at it to keep you busy</text>
  <text start="662.83" dur="6.28">to keep you distracted from what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="665.75" dur="6.36">really going on here now we know Puerto</text>
  <text start="669.11" dur="7.71">Rico right now is having a very rough</text>
  <text start="672.11" dur="8.43">time they&amp;#39;re defaulting they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="676.82" dur="6.66">the funds to pay the creditors and right</text>
  <text start="680.54" dur="6.21">now Obama is pushing Congress to give</text>
  <text start="683.48" dur="7.37">Puerto Rico sweeping powers to reduce</text>
  <text start="686.75" dur="9.18">its 73 billion debt burden through</text>
  <text start="690.85" dur="6.94">bankruptcy now there is no law that says</text>
  <text start="695.93" dur="4.659">they can do this</text>
  <text start="697.79" dur="5.38">so what are they going to do they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="700.589" dur="4.53">going to create a new law which will</text>
  <text start="703.17" dur="3.899">allow Puerto Rico to do this can you</text>
  <text start="705.119" dur="4.95">imagine if you have the ability to</text>
  <text start="707.069" dur="5.971">create a new law to help you out in a</text>
  <text start="710.069" dur="5.82">tough situation that would be great but</text>
  <text start="713.04" dur="6.12">I noticed that the central bank&amp;#39;s the US</text>
  <text start="715.889" dur="6.12">government every time they get into</text>
  <text start="719.16" dur="6.089">trouble they make up new rules new laws</text>
  <text start="722.009" dur="5.461">because what&amp;#39;s out there doesn&amp;#39;t pertain</text>
  <text start="725.249" dur="5.161">to them they just make it up as they go</text>
  <text start="727.47" dur="7.2">along we should all be able to do that</text>
  <text start="730.41" dur="6.599">that would be fantastic so what he wants</text>
  <text start="734.67" dur="4.979">to do he wants to make an independent</text>
  <text start="737.009" dur="4.8">body to monitor the islands fiscal</text>
  <text start="739.649" dur="4.651">affairs just like the troika that</text>
  <text start="741.809" dur="6.69">monitors Greece and they will give them</text>
  <text start="744.3" dur="7.68">funds when they need it so the bottom</text>
  <text start="748.499" dur="5.34">line is that Puerto Rico is Greece laws</text>
  <text start="751.98" dur="3.359">will be changed to enable the spending</text>
  <text start="753.839" dur="4.141">of the past to be brushed under the</text>
  <text start="755.339" dur="5.1">carpet federal oversight of fiscal</text>
  <text start="757.98" dur="5.19">affairs will be handled by an</text>
  <text start="760.439" dur="6.06">independent body and it will enable</text>
  <text start="763.17" dur="7.95">Puerto Rico to borrow more from the US</text>
  <text start="766.499" dur="7.14">taxpayer to fund what officials call</text>

  <text start="773.639" dur="5.31">come up with growth initiatives and you</text>
  <text start="776.459" dur="4.401">know it&amp;#39;s the opposite basically what</text>
  <text start="778.949" dur="7.14">they&amp;#39;re doing is borrowing more money</text>
  <text start="780.86" dur="7.959">bailing out Puerto Rico and they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="786.089" dur="5.85">be able to repay this either and who is</text>
  <text start="788.819" dur="7.921">left with the cost of all this the US</text>
