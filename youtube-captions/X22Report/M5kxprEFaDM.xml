  <text start="245.51" dur="3.75">out and spend on other items because I</text>
  <text start="247.85" dur="3.169">realize eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="249.26" dur="4.92">happen is these prices will go back up</text>
  <text start="251.019" dur="6.241">actually a lot of the products will go</text>

  <text start="260.329" dur="4.981">they fluctuate a little bit but we look</text>
  <text start="262.31" dur="4.38">over the long period of time we see that</text>
  <text start="265.31" dur="2.88">yes all of these items</text>
  <text start="266.69" dur="3.57">you go up and really what&amp;#39;s happening is</text>
  <text start="268.19" dur="3.48">the value of the dollar is decreasing</text>
  <text start="270.26" dur="4.92">and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing but we see</text>
  <text start="271.67" dur="6.75">us personal spending dropped point two</text>
  <text start="275.18" dur="5.82">percent in January twice as bad as the</text>
  <text start="278.42" dur="5.52">point one percent drop expected and the</text>
  <text start="281" dur="5.55">third miss in a row personal income also</text>
  <text start="283.94" dur="4.95">missed expectations rising just point</text>
  <text start="286.55" dur="5.94">three percent they expected a point four</text>
  <text start="288.89" dur="6.42">percent rise hovering at its lowest</text>
  <text start="292.49" dur="4.86">growth since September the savings rates</text>
  <text start="295.31" dur="5.64">urge to five point five percent its</text>
  <text start="297.35" dur="6.72">highest since december of 2012 right</text>
  <text start="300.95" dur="5.58">after 2008 when everything started</text>
  <text start="304.07" dur="4.77">falling apart we went into 2009-2010</text>
  <text start="306.53" dur="3.6">people started to sock money away</text>
  <text start="308.84" dur="3.21">whatever they possibly can and they</text>
  <text start="310.13" dur="4.2">stopped their spending because they were</text>
  <text start="312.05" dur="4.86">nervous the same thing as happening</text>
  <text start="314.33" dur="5.67">right now that savings that we see at</text>
  <text start="316.91" dur="5.04">the gas pump people are holding on to it</text>
  <text start="320" dur="4.2">with dear life because they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="321.95" dur="3.72">what&amp;#39;s going to happen and a lot of</text>
  <text start="324.2" dur="3.69">people are using it to pay for their</text>
  <text start="325.67" dur="5.82">Obamacare insurance because that has</text>
  <text start="327.89" dur="6.39">been going up quite a bit so this didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="331.49" dur="5.94">spur economic growth it didn&amp;#39;t spur</text>
  <text start="334.28" dur="4.56">retail sales actually the opposite is</text>
  <text start="337.43" dur="3.63">happening right now we see a lot of</text>
  <text start="338.84" dur="3.63">retailers going out of business we see</text>
  <text start="341.06" dur="4.14">them closing stores and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="342.47" dur="5.25">are getting laid off so things are not</text>
  <text start="345.2" dur="5.16">going well in the economy and when we</text>
  <text start="347.72" dur="5.91">look at the economy we understand</text>
  <text start="350.36" dur="5.67">there&amp;#39;s lots and lots of bubbles the</text>
  <text start="353.63" dur="5.27">student loan bubble the stock market</text>
  <text start="356.03" dur="5.1">bubble the housing bubble and the auto</text>
  <text start="358.9" dur="3.22">industry bottle and the derivatives</text>
  <text start="361.13" dur="3.21">bubble but don&amp;#39;t worry about the</text>
  <text start="362.12" dur="3.81">derivatives because the bankers already</text>
  <text start="364.34" dur="3.51">took care of that we reported on this</text>
  <text start="365.93" dur="5.13">quite a while ago where they passed</text>
  <text start="367.85" dur="5.31">legislation where they kind of fit it</text>
  <text start="371.06" dur="5.22">into another bill where I think was the</text>
  <text start="373.16" dur="5.31">spending bill where it protects them if</text>
  <text start="376.28" dur="5.01">the derivative market comes crashing</text>
  <text start="378.47" dur="5.15">down where the FDIC is going to bail</text>
  <text start="381.29" dur="5.879">them out and guess what the derivative</text>
  <text start="383.62" dur="5.65">bailout is before the depositor bailout</text>
  <text start="387.169" dur="4.051">so they have already protected</text>
  <text start="389.27" dur="3.87">themselves but the other bubbles they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="391.22" dur="3.99">just gonna pop and the entire things</text>
  <text start="393.14" dur="3.93">going to be come crumbling down and you</text>
  <text start="395.21" dur="3.63">have to remember they do all of this not</text>
  <text start="397.07" dur="3.03">because you just by chance something</text>
  <text start="398.84" dur="3.29">like this is going to happen</text>
  <text start="400.1" dur="4.35">they know it&amp;#39;s going to happen and</text>
  <text start="402.13" dur="3.76">they&amp;#39;re preparing for what do you think</text>
  <text start="404.45" dur="3.66">they came up with the beylin documents</text>
  <text start="405.89" dur="4.86">why do you think the FDIC now backs</text>
  <text start="408.11" dur="4.65">derivatives think about this what</text>
  <text start="410.75" dur="3.81">possible reason would they do this</text>
  <text start="412.76" dur="4.56">unless they know that something is</text>
  <text start="414.56" dur="5.73">definitely going to happen but when we</text>
  <text start="417.32" dur="5.79">look at the auto industry we see oh yes</text>
  <text start="420.29" dur="6.33">it&amp;#39;s following in the same footsteps as</text>
  <text start="423.11" dur="6.99">the housing bubble back in 2007-2008</text>
  <text start="426.62" dur="4.86">when that entire thing fell apart I mean</text>
  <text start="430.1" dur="3.45">we&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing in housing</text>
  <text start="431.48" dur="4.71">occurring right now but we also see it</text>
  <text start="433.55" dur="5.52">in the auto industry loans for new and</text>
  <text start="436.19" dur="5.61">used cars will in short order eclipse</text>
  <text start="439.07" dur="5.37">the one trillion mark joining total</text>
  <text start="441.8" dur="5.31">student loan debt in a full-on bubble</text>
  <text start="444.44" dur="6.87">mode early delinquencies on auto loans</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="7.71">are now sitting back at their 2008 highs</text>
  <text start="451.31" dur="5.46">both for all borrowers and the subprime</text>
  <text start="454.82" dur="3.57">borrowers with nine percent of the</text>
  <text start="456.77" dur="5.04">latter now missing a payment within the</text>
  <text start="458.39" dur="7.86">first eight months of origination nearly</text>
  <text start="461.81" dur="6.99">a third of all auto loans in 2013 two</text>
  <text start="466.25" dur="5.34">who else but these subprime bars we saw</text>
  <text start="468.8" dur="5.13">this back in two thousand six when</text>
  <text start="471.59" dur="4.77">everything was looking fantastic and</text>
  <text start="473.93" dur="5.85">everything was great they were blowing</text>
  <text start="476.36" dur="6.18">these bubbles up indeed when we look at</text>
  <text start="479.78" dur="7.89">the situation we see that these people</text>
  <text start="482.54" dur="7.8">are now over leveraged lenders are again</text>
  <text start="487.67" dur="4.89">showing a propensity towards origination</text>
  <text start="490.34" dur="4.65">for the purpose of selling loans rather</text>
  <text start="492.56" dur="4.62">than holding them they&amp;#39;re bundling them</text>
  <text start="494.99" dur="4.8">together selling the auto loan</text>
  <text start="497.18" dur="4.41">securities that are not holding them we</text>
  <text start="499.79" dur="4.16">saw this with the housing industry it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="501.59" dur="6.27">still going on with the housing industry</text>
  <text start="503.95" dur="6.34">just how bad has this gotten well Darren</text>
  <text start="507.86" dur="3.93">Bent heart a senior regulatory official</text>
  <text start="510.29" dur="3.99">at the office of the comptroller of</text>
  <text start="511.79" dur="4.59">currency which regulates Wells Fargo</text>
  <text start="514.28" dur="6.48">noted that lenders had extended</text>

  <text start="520.76" dur="3.81">percent longer than the typical period</text>
  <text start="522.44" dur="4.14">and were making loans that were far</text>
  <text start="524.57" dur="4.47">greater than the value of the car</text>
  <text start="526.58" dur="6.66">because they&amp;#39;re just doing whatever they</text>
  <text start="529.04" dur="6.239">possibly can to get these cars sold they</text>
  <text start="533.24" dur="4.86">need to make the economy look like</text>
  <text start="535.279" dur="5.791">everything is fine this is why they&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="554.959" dur="5.25">continually blow into them eventually</text>
  <text start="557.36" dur="5.039">they will pop and we&amp;#39;re going to see the</text>
  <text start="560.209" dur="6.661">same thing that occurred back in two</text>

  <text start="903.38" dur="4.98">we talked about net neutrality and my</text>

  <text start="911.54" dur="6.3">free and open which we know this is not</text>
  <text start="914.9" dur="7.32">what they&amp;#39;re doing they created a 332</text>
  <text start="917.84" dur="6.99">page report of course nobody can see</text>
  <text start="922.22" dur="4.14">this because you have to vote first then</text>

  <text start="926.36" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;ll let you know what you voted on</text>

  <text start="931.64" dur="2.639">internet open and free I don&amp;#39;t know why</text>
  <text start="933.38" dur="2.55">you need 303</text>
  <text start="934.279" dur="4.35">pages because the internet is open and</text>
  <text start="935.93" dur="4.44">free now and there are zero pages maybe</text>
  <text start="938.629" dur="4.111">it could be a paragraph keep it open and</text>

  <text start="942.74" dur="5.19">we&amp;#39;re starting to see that maybe this is</text>
  <text start="945.29" dur="5.099">not really about net neutrality at all</text>
  <text start="947.93" dur="4.529">and we kind of knew this because why</text>
  <text start="950.389" dur="6.781">would they have to create a document</text>
  <text start="952.459" dur="6.901">that was 332 pages long why did the FCC</text>
  <text start="957.17" dur="4.019">have to get involved but when we look at</text>

  <text start="2568.5" dur="4.56">this this couldn&amp;#39;t have been from Russia</text>
  <text start="2570.78" dur="4.35">there was nothing to gain from this but</text>
  <text start="2573.06" dur="5.13">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is the leaders</text>
  <text start="2575.13" dur="4.56">of this opposition apparently dismissed</text>
  <text start="2578.19" dur="5.81">the notion that the Kremlin was behind</text>
  <text start="2579.69" dur="6.419">the murder whatsoever actually Putin he</text>
  <text start="2584" dur="5.68">predicted this was going to happen about</text>
  <text start="2586.109" dur="7.01">two years ago and Putin explaining this</text>
  <text start="2589.68" dur="7.409">two years ago on a video that yeah</text>
  <text start="2593.119" dur="5.551">something like this could happen where</text>
  <text start="2597.089" dur="4.561">they could create a false flag</text>
  <text start="2598.67" dur="6.1">assassination within Russia in order to</text>
  <text start="2601.65" dur="4.77">create an involuntary martyr that the</text>
  <text start="2604.77" dur="4.44">Western media would use to demonize</text>
  <text start="2606.42" dur="4.26">Russia and we can see this is what</text>
  <text start="2609.21" dur="2.7">they&amp;#39;re trying to do but if Putin was</text>
  <text start="2610.68" dur="4.13">really going to do this you have to</text>
  <text start="2611.91" dur="6.35">remember he was with the KGB at the time</text>
  <text start="2614.81" dur="7.66">he would have done this with a car crash</text>
  <text start="2618.26" dur="6.52">with a plane crash it wouldn&amp;#39;t have been</text>
  <text start="2622.47" dur="4.47">done execution-style out in the open if</text>
  <text start="2624.78" dur="5.43">they did do it this way they would have</text>
  <text start="2626.94" dur="5.34">a patsy right away to blame it on they</text>
  <text start="2630.21" dur="3.54">wouldn&amp;#39;t leave it open like this where</text>
  <text start="2632.28" dur="3.75">the corporate media in the United States</text>
  <text start="2633.75" dur="4.26">and the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="2636.03" dur="5.16">could come out and say ooh this was a</text>
  <text start="2638.01" dur="6.72">Russian hit so you know right at this</text>
  <text start="2641.19" dur="6.39">point that it wasn&amp;#39;t Putin because look</text>
  <text start="2644.73" dur="5.94">at the Kennedy assassination they had</text>
  <text start="2647.58" dur="6.15">someone set up right away when the</text>
  <text start="2650.67" dur="4.919">government took him out they had someone</text>
  <text start="2653.73" dur="4.65">set up if they wanted to kill other</text>
  <text start="2655.589" dur="6.871">people it was a car accident it was a</text>
  <text start="2658.38" dur="6.63">plane believe me they&amp;#39;re not that stupid</text>
  <text start="2662.46" dur="5.46">to do this right in the open and leave</text>
  <text start="2665.01" dur="4.53">it open-ended and this is how you know</text>
  <text start="2667.92" dur="3.99">this was planned</text>
  <text start="2669.54" dur="4.02">propaganda purposes because as soon as</text>
  <text start="2671.91" dur="4.29">this happened the corporate media was</text>
  <text start="2673.56" dur="5.37">all over it looking at Russia look at</text>
  <text start="2676.2" dur="5.25">this he was an opposition the man said</text>
  <text start="2678.93" dur="4.2">he was afraid of Putin he might he was</text>
  <text start="2681.45" dur="3.84">fearful for his life and he was going on</text>
  <text start="2683.13" dur="6.12">and on and on and you can tell they were</text>
  <text start="2685.29" dur="5.97">pushing the propaganda because again why</text>
  <text start="2689.25" dur="5.43">would he do this out in the open and</text>
  <text start="2691.26" dur="6.81">leave it open-ended where it looks like</text>
  <text start="2694.68" dur="6.45">Russia did it it makes no sense the man</text>
  <text start="2698.07" dur="6.45">smarter than this from everything that</text>
  <text start="2701.13" dur="5.64">we see in all the actions that he all</text>
  <text start="2704.52" dur="5.37">the things that he does we can see that</text>
  <text start="2706.77" dur="4.83">he wouldn&amp;#39;t do this in this way and when</text>
  <text start="2709.89" dur="4.26">we look at the US government the central</text>
  <text start="2711.6" dur="5.37">bankers yeah this is how they work it</text>
  <text start="2714.15" dur="6.78">look at Ukraine with the snipers they</text>
  <text start="2716.97" dur="6.36">were firing on both sides and the</text>
  <text start="2720.93" dur="4.38">snipers were part of aah the US</text>
  <text start="2723.33" dur="7.89">government central bankers to make it</text>
  <text start="2725.31" dur="10.11">look like it was the Yanukovych the the</text>
  <text start="2731.22" dur="7.68">government firing upon the people this</text>
  <text start="2735.42" dur="6.6">is how they work and we can see that</text>
  <text start="2738.9" dur="6.06">this was a false flag for regime change</text>
  <text start="2742.02" dur="5.19">in Russia and they&amp;#39;re going to push this</text>
  <text start="2744.96" dur="4.41">as hard as they possibly can this is the</text>
  <text start="2747.21" dur="4.92">first stage they&amp;#39;re going to try many</text>
  <text start="2749.37" dur="7.14">other things because they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="2752.13" dur="7.41">provoke war in the end and if they get</text>
  <text start="2756.51" dur="5.31">someone in there that could push war it</text>
  <text start="2759.54" dur="4.68">would work out or if they can get</text>
  <text start="2761.82" dur="5.01">someone in there that could implement</text>
  <text start="2764.22" dur="5.67">the central bank a private western</text>
  <text start="2766.83" dur="5.58">central bank put all Russia&amp;#39;s oil on the</text>
  <text start="2769.89" dur="4.64">dollar and get rid of the brick system</text>
  <text start="2772.41" dur="4.62">that would work to their benefit to</text>
  <text start="2774.53" dur="4.39">their trying it in China the trying in</text>
  <text start="2777.03" dur="3.81">Russia but right now it looks like</text>
  <text start="2778.92" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re pushing war because the Russians</text>
  <text start="2780.84" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re too smart for this they know</text>
  <text start="2782.7" dur="4.77">what&amp;#39;s going on they realize exactly</text>
  <text start="2785.55" dur="6.53">what the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="2787.47" dur="7.92">are up to and we can see that Putin</text>
  <text start="2792.08" dur="6.22">brokered a peace deal in August of 2013</text>
  <text start="2795.39" dur="5.13">if he really wanted war he would have</text>

  <text start="2833.35" dur="5.4">wanted war and they&amp;#39;re not going to stop</text>
  <text start="2836.86" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re going to keep pushing until they</text>
  <text start="2838.75" dur="4.92">get war because they realize the system</text>
  <text start="2841.06" dur="6.54">is breaking down it is collapsing and</text>
  <text start="2843.67" dur="6.51">they need to push war quickly because as</text>
