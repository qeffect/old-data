  <text start="53.22" dur="8.04">hi and welcome you listening to the x-22</text>
  <text start="57.27" dur="7.59">report my name is david&amp;#39;s episode 1322 a</text>
  <text start="61.26" dur="6">and today&amp;#39;s date is July 3rd 2017 and</text>
  <text start="64.86" dur="4.86">the title of the episode is all the</text>
  <text start="67.26" dur="5.91">economic collapse pieces are falling</text>
  <text start="69.72" dur="5.85">into place let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="73.17" dur="4.29">collapse financial news now as we are</text>
  <text start="75.57" dur="4.41">moving further and further into this</text>
  <text start="77.46" dur="5.58">year we can see that there are many</text>
  <text start="79.98" dur="5.67">aspects of the economy that are really</text>
  <text start="83.04" dur="5.04">not doing well and I&amp;#39;m going to say this</text>
  <text start="85.65" dur="4.62">once again I&amp;#39;ve said it since I started</text>
  <text start="88.08" dur="4.32">you need to get prepared for what is</text>
  <text start="90.27" dur="5.849">coming because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="92.4" dur="6.9">now is a complete breakdown of the</text>
  <text start="96.119" dur="6.601">system I mean think about it just a year</text>
  <text start="99.3" dur="5.819">ago or two years ago they were out there</text>
  <text start="102.72" dur="5.759">telling us how great the recovery was</text>
  <text start="105.119" dur="7.11">going manual manufacturing was telling</text>
  <text start="108.479" dur="8.311">us how great car sales were how great</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="8.18">housing was how fantastic retail was</text>
  <text start="116.79" dur="5.93">doing online sales as incredible and</text>
  <text start="120.409" dur="4.541">fast-forward to today</text>
  <text start="122.72" dur="4.18">everything is just completely breaking</text>
  <text start="124.95" dur="4.35">down now everything that I just said</text>
  <text start="126.9" dur="4.86">that was being reported on the corporate</text>
  <text start="129.3" dur="6.06">media that was being reported by the Fed</text>
  <text start="131.76" dur="5.22">by the government at the time and we</text>
  <text start="135.36" dur="3.81">were looking at it saying well no it</text>
  <text start="136.98" dur="3.96">looks kind of like the opposite of what</text>
  <text start="139.17" dur="4.379">they&amp;#39;re saying it doesn&amp;#39;t look like</text>
  <text start="140.94" dur="4.74">things are doing well it doesn&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="143.549" dur="3.541">like the auto manufacturers are actually</text>
  <text start="145.68" dur="3.69">doing well and when we looked into the</text>
  <text start="147.09" dur="4.17">numbers and look what they were doing we</text>
  <text start="149.37" dur="3.99">saw that they were channel stuffing and</text>
  <text start="151.26" dur="3.99">then we realize what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="153.36" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re producing a lot of cars which</text>
  <text start="155.25" dur="5.88">makes manufacturing look a lot better</text>
  <text start="157.68" dur="5.7">and every time they delivered a car to a</text>
  <text start="161.13" dur="5.79">dealership lot they counted that as a</text>
  <text start="163.38" dur="6.72">sale and they continually did this to</text>
  <text start="166.92" dur="5.52">make us believe that car sales were</text>
  <text start="170.1" dur="5.25">doing fantastic then they also added</text>
  <text start="172.44" dur="5.34">incentives they allowed subprime people</text>
  <text start="175.35" dur="4.59">to come in to move those cars later on</text>
  <text start="177.78" dur="4.2">could they move all of the cars no the</text>
  <text start="179.94" dur="5.58">Lots stayed full and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="181.98" dur="5.26">right now is that GM is reporting its</text>
  <text start="185.52" dur="4.57">june results</text>
  <text start="187.24" dur="6.24">which again are disappointing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="190.09" dur="6.42">down 4.7% more than the expected 3.4</text>
  <text start="193.48" dur="8.61">percent decline now what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="196.51" dur="8.19">here is that chevy GMC Buick Cadillac</text>
  <text start="202.09" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;re looking at sales that are down by</text>
  <text start="204.7" dur="4.29">negative six point four percent negative</text>
  <text start="206.68" dur="5.54">three point six percent negative eleven</text>
  <text start="208.99" dur="5.49">point eight percent and the situation is</text>
  <text start="212.22" dur="4.93">not getting any better if we look at the</text>
  <text start="214.48" dur="5.79">channel stuffing we see GM&amp;#39;s channel</text>
  <text start="217.15" dur="7.02">stuffing just hit a new all-time high</text>
  <text start="220.27" dur="6.15">and what does this mean well the number</text>
  <text start="224.17" dur="5.31">of cars that are on the lot right now</text>
  <text start="226.42" dur="6.48">are the highest since the summer before</text>
  <text start="229.48" dur="7.23">the recession officially began in 2008</text>
  <text start="232.9" dur="5.37">now GM Ford Chrysler they posted year on</text>
  <text start="236.71" dur="4.29">your sales decline of about six percent</text>
  <text start="238.27" dur="5.46">on average and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="241" dur="6.48">that the automobile manufacturing</text>
  <text start="243.73" dur="5.58">industry it is turned downward and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="247.48" dur="5.07">get it&amp;#39;s not getting better it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="249.31" dur="6.69">a lot worse when we turn to housing and</text>
  <text start="252.55" dur="7.08">we look at construction spending well</text>
  <text start="256" dur="6.36">this does not look good at all the Econo</text>
  <text start="259.63" dur="5.64">de consensus well they expected a bounce</text>
  <text start="262.36" dur="4.92">in May for construction spending but the</text>
  <text start="265.27" dur="3.6">only bounce was in April and the only</text>
  <text start="267.28" dur="3.6">reason they had a bounce in April is</text>
  <text start="268.87" dur="7.32">because they revised a number from</text>
  <text start="270.88" dur="8.28">negative 1.4 to negative 0.7% May well</text>
  <text start="276.19" dur="5.88">nothing happened and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="279.16" dur="6.09">right now is that residential</text>
  <text start="282.07" dur="7.08">construction spending is down 0.6%</text>
  <text start="285.25" dur="5.34">overall and this includes declines in</text>
  <text start="289.15" dur="4.05">single-family homes residential</text>
  <text start="290.59" dur="6.63">improvements especially in multifamily</text>
  <text start="293.2" dur="5.85">units and in the past we saw</text>
  <text start="297.22" dur="4.74">construction spending moving up</text>
  <text start="299.05" dur="5.64">everything has turned around right now</text>
  <text start="301.96" dur="5.4">and what we&amp;#39;re starting to realize is</text>
  <text start="304.69" dur="4.53">when you cannot keep the illusion alive</text>
  <text start="307.36" dur="5.4">when you don&amp;#39;t have those individuals in</text>
  <text start="309.22" dur="5.82">government in the Fed manipulating these</text>
  <text start="312.76" dur="4.02">numbers things start to fall apart and</text>
  <text start="315.04" dur="3.51">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing in the</text>
  <text start="316.78" dur="4.29">government right now where a lot of</text>
  <text start="318.55" dur="5.19">these individuals while they&amp;#39;re gone</text>
  <text start="321.07" dur="3.78">and the illusion is falling apart right</text>
  <text start="323.74" dur="3.84">in front of our eyes it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="324.85" dur="5.61">Obamacare when Obama was in office he</text>
  <text start="327.58" dur="6.39">had the ability to create the illusion</text>
  <text start="330.46" dur="5.1">by moving funds around by manipulating</text>
  <text start="333.97" dur="4.5">the numbers letting everyone know how</text>
  <text start="335.56" dur="5.49">great it was that 1820 million people</text>
  <text start="338.47" dur="4.44">were joining and of course a lot of</text>
  <text start="341.05" dur="3.42">those individuals were already had</text>
  <text start="342.91" dur="4.74">insurance a lot of the people were on</text>
  <text start="344.47" dur="5.07">Medicaid and while you&amp;#39;re in office</text>
  <text start="347.65" dur="5.4">you&amp;#39;re able to manipulate the entire</text>
  <text start="349.54" dur="4.65">thing once you leave office and a lot of</text>
  <text start="353.05" dur="3.27">these people leave and you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="354.19" dur="6.6">manipulate these numbers you see the</text>
  <text start="356.32" dur="7.32">real truth shine through and you see it</text>
  <text start="360.79" dur="6.12">completely collapse on itself and this</text>
  <text start="363.64" dur="4.47">is why as these insurers get wind of</text>
  <text start="366.91" dur="3.36">what&amp;#39;s really happening and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="368.11" dur="4.26">seeing that all these you know coops</text>
  <text start="370.27" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re closing left and right there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="372.37" dur="4.2">only like four left because they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="375.04" dur="4.46">there saying we don&amp;#39;t want to be in this</text>
  <text start="376.57" dur="5.58">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="379.5" dur="5.32">manufacturing really has gone nowhere we</text>
  <text start="382.15" dur="5.31">haven&amp;#39;t brought back manufacturing as of</text>
  <text start="384.82" dur="5.55">yet yes Trump is planning on doing this</text>
  <text start="387.46" dur="5.39">because he needs to do this for the</text>
  <text start="390.37" dur="5.42">reset of the country we need</text>
  <text start="392.85" dur="7.51">manufacturing in this country we cannot</text>
  <text start="395.79" dur="6.73">survive on a service industry and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="400.36" dur="5.07">very interesting about this is the</text>
  <text start="402.52" dur="5.64">corporate media well they&amp;#39;re all over</text>
  <text start="405.43" dur="6.09">the place now we have two stories coming</text>
  <text start="408.16" dur="5.91">out about manufacturing today and one is</text>
  <text start="411.52" dur="4.68">from market and they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="414.07" dur="4.62">June report on US manufacturing said</text>
  <text start="416.2" dur="5.31">that manufacturing growth weakens again</text>
  <text start="418.69" dur="6.36">in June now this is coming from chief</text>
  <text start="421.51" dur="5.58">economist Chris Williamson saying that</text>
  <text start="425.05" dur="4.26">manufacturers reported disappointing end</text>
  <text start="427.09" dur="4.92">to the second quarter with few signs of</text>
  <text start="429.31" dur="5.19">growth picking up anytime soon usually</text>
  <text start="432.01" dur="5.73">market is pretty darn close to what is</text>
  <text start="434.5" dur="5.88">really happening in the economy then we</text>
  <text start="437.74" dur="4.17">have Bloomberg and of course they come</text>
  <text start="440.38" dur="4.35">out with this article in other corporate</text>
  <text start="441.91" dur="5.79">media&amp;#39;s outlets they pick up on this</text>
  <text start="444.73" dur="6.03">article now Bloomberg came out and their</text>
  <text start="447.7" dur="6.48">article reads manufacturing pick up in</text>
  <text start="450.76" dur="6.96">us signals boost to economic growth</text>
  <text start="454.18" dur="6.3">now we have two opposite things that are</text>
  <text start="457.72" dur="5.94">out there today and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="460.48" dur="6.62">American factories powered up in June at</text>
  <text start="463.66" dur="6.8">the fastest pace in nearly three years</text>
  <text start="467.1" dur="7.57">production orders employment all</text>
  <text start="470.46" dur="7.78">thriving really how possibly can this be</text>
  <text start="474.67" dur="5.13">happening the automobile industry which</text>
  <text start="478.24" dur="5.25">is a lot of the manufacturing in this</text>
  <text start="479.8" dur="5.97">country is channel stuffing the</text>
  <text start="483.49" dur="6.02">dealership lots now the dealership lots</text>
  <text start="485.77" dur="6.57">they are at their peak automobile</text>
  <text start="489.51" dur="4.96">manufacturers they&amp;#39;re not producing as</text>
  <text start="492.34" dur="5.16">much as they were before actually that</text>
  <text start="494.47" dur="6.84">is declining right now so one of these</text>
  <text start="497.5" dur="6.39">stories is completely fake and we kind</text>
  <text start="501.31" dur="4.47">of know which one it is but what this</text>
  <text start="503.89" dur="4.62">shows us is that they&amp;#39;re all over the</text>
  <text start="505.78" dur="3.99">place and we can see that they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="508.51" dur="3.33">make heads or tails of what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="509.77" dur="5.04">going on anymore because remember a lot</text>
  <text start="511.84" dur="5.07">of their stories they don&amp;#39;t come from</text>
  <text start="514.81" dur="4.83">investigating anything a lot of their</text>
  <text start="516.91" dur="5.31">information comes from the intelligence</text>
  <text start="519.64" dur="4.62">community it comes from the deep state</text>
  <text start="522.22" dur="3.96">they tell them what to put out there</text>
  <text start="524.26" dur="5.43">they tell them to spit in the headlines</text>
  <text start="526.18" dur="6.09">and things are basically breaking down</text>
  <text start="529.69" dur="4.5">right now we see out in Silicon Valley</text>
  <text start="532.27" dur="4.59">while things are beginning to crack out</text>
  <text start="534.19" dur="5.55">there and Wolff Richter he is reporting</text>
  <text start="536.86" dur="3.24">that the Silicon Valley commercial real</text>
  <text start="539.74" dur="4.44">estate</text>
  <text start="540.1" dur="5.88">well it&amp;#39;s barely hanging on and there</text>
  <text start="544.18" dur="4.44">are parts where it has let go already</text>
  <text start="545.98" dur="5.67">and he&amp;#39;s saying on the great American</text>
  <text start="548.62" dur="5.52">Parkway there are so many offices that</text>
  <text start="551.65" dur="5.61">are for lease right now it&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="554.14" dur="7.26">ridiculous and from a year ago it is up</text>
  <text start="557.26" dur="6.51">19% and there are just so many empty</text>
  <text start="561.4" dur="4.83">buildings and he shows all these</text>
  <text start="563.77" dur="4.05">different pictures of these buildings</text>
  <text start="566.23" dur="3.72">just standing there completely empty</text>
  <text start="567.82" dur="3.93">saying yes we&amp;#39;re ready to lease and it</text>
  <text start="569.95" dur="5.58">looks like the shrubs around it or</text>
  <text start="571.75" dur="5.37">overgrown they can&amp;#39;t move them and this</text>
  <text start="575.53" dur="3.24">is just the beginning because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="577.12" dur="4.56">seeing is a complete breakdown of</text>
  <text start="578.77" dur="6.12">everything and just yesterday reported</text>
  <text start="581.68" dur="6.26">on how Jersey Connecticut Maine Illinois</text>
  <text start="584.89" dur="5.93">and many other states they&amp;#39;re all having</text>
  <text start="587.94" dur="5.79">and it&amp;#39;s just getting worse and worse as</text>
  <text start="590.82" dur="4.8">time goes on when we look at Illinois we</text>
  <text start="593.73" dur="3.03">can see they&amp;#39;re trying to raise the tax</text>
  <text start="595.62" dur="3.54">rate they&amp;#39;re trying to raise the</text>
  <text start="596.76" dur="3.96">corporate income tax rate and this is</text>
  <text start="599.16" dur="3.09">just going to force a lot of people out</text>
  <text start="600.72" dur="3.42">of the state it&amp;#39;s going to force a lot</text>
  <text start="602.25" dur="4.35">of companies out of state we already see</text>
  <text start="604.14" dur="4.56">in Connecticut and this is not going to</text>
  <text start="606.6" dur="4.22">help the situation and I know the</text>
  <text start="608.7" dur="5.16">governor is out there saying listen I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="610.82" dur="5.08">pass this but it has to be a temporary</text>
  <text start="613.86" dur="4.71">tax hike because he doesn&amp;#39;t want to put</text>
  <text start="615.9" dur="4.29">the burden on the Illinois people you</text>
  <text start="618.57" dur="4.02">know what happens when they pass these</text>
  <text start="620.19" dur="3.96">things it is never temporary yes they</text>
  <text start="622.59" dur="2.94">say that in the beginning but what</text>
  <text start="624.15" dur="3.57">happens it becomes permanent because</text>
  <text start="625.53" dur="4.53">once they start taking those funds you</text>
  <text start="627.72" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t want to give it up so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="630.06" dur="3.66">seeing right now is the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="632.19" dur="3.9">end we&amp;#39;re seeing things break down</text>
  <text start="633.72" dur="4.26">state-by-state pensions are in trouble</text>
  <text start="636.09" dur="2.31">the automobile manufacturers are in</text>
  <text start="637.98" dur="2.58">trouble</text>
  <text start="638.4" dur="4.79">retail is in trouble and you have to</text>
  <text start="640.56" dur="4.85">remember this entire country the</text>
  <text start="643.19" dur="6.88">recovery that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="645.41" dur="5.91">they based all these jobs on these</text>
  <text start="650.07" dur="6.33">part-time</text>
  <text start="651.32" dur="9.31">retail food industry jobs that were</text>
  <text start="656.4" dur="8.28">created during this entire period now we</text>
  <text start="660.63" dur="7.32">see this retail food industry area it is</text>
  <text start="664.68" dur="7.95">completely breaking down and people are</text>
  <text start="667.95" dur="8.22">losing hundreds of thousands of jobs the</text>
  <text start="672.63" dur="7.47">whole thing is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="676.17" dur="6.75">all the pieces to this economic collapse</text>
  <text start="680.1" dur="6.48">puzzle they&amp;#39;re all coming together think</text>
  <text start="682.92" dur="7.47">about right now go back three years ago</text>
  <text start="686.58" dur="6.57">at the height of the illusion where they</text>
  <text start="690.39" dur="4.44">blew the bubbles up or they were blowing</text>
  <text start="693.15" dur="4.05">the bubbles up with stimulus telling you</text>
  <text start="694.83" dur="4.89">how great things were and people were</text>
  <text start="697.2" dur="6.02">feeling great even though we knew it was</text>
  <text start="699.72" dur="7.17">a complete illusion three years - now</text>
  <text start="703.22" dur="6.67">look how everything has changed</text>
