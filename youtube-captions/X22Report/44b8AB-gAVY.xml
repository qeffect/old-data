  <text start="269.78" dur="7.08">to keep it sealed you know it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="273.11" dur="7.17">be leaked out now as we know the House</text>
  <text start="276.86" dur="6.17">Dems they went ahead and they unveiled</text>
  <text start="280.28" dur="5.66">the two articles of impeachment</text>
  <text start="283.03" dur="4.27">what are they abuse of power and</text>
  <text start="285.94" dur="3.849">obstruction of</text>
  <text start="287.3" dur="4.859">Congress Trump tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="289.789" dur="4.321">Naylor just said that I pressured</text>
  <text start="292.159" dur="4.561">Ukraine to interfere in our 2020</text>
  <text start="294.11" dur="4.89">election ridiculous and he knows that</text>
  <text start="296.72" dur="3.659">this is not true both the president and</text>
  <text start="299" dur="4.05">foreign minister of ukraine said many</text>
  <text start="300.379" dur="5.431">times that there was no pressure</text>
  <text start="303.05" dur="6.6">Nadler in the Dems know this but refused</text>
  <text start="305.81" dur="6.599">to acknowledge it so the Dems went ahead</text>
  <text start="309.65" dur="5.07">and they filed the abuse of power and</text>
  <text start="312.409" dur="4.651">obstruction of Congress first of all</text>
  <text start="314.72" dur="4.74">where&amp;#39;s the whistleblower what happened</text>
  <text start="317.06" dur="6">to quid pro quo what happened to bribery</text>
  <text start="319.46" dur="5.359">what happened to extortion all of this</text>
  <text start="323.06" dur="6.87">is going according to plan</text>
  <text start="324.819" dur="8.741">think about it FISA D class criminal</text>
  <text start="329.93" dur="8.31">investigation crimes against humanity</text>
  <text start="333.56" dur="9">it&amp;#39;s the perfect storm to be exposed at</text>
  <text start="338.24" dur="9.479">the Senate trial once it&amp;#39;s exposed well</text>
  <text start="342.56" dur="8.009">for an team come in and they unseal the</text>
  <text start="347.719" dur="5.641">indictments now of course this is one</text>
  <text start="350.569" dur="6.75">scenario Trump and the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="353.36" dur="6.69">have prepared for all scenarios but so</text>
  <text start="357.319" dur="5.611">far it seems that this is the direction</text>
  <text start="360.05" dur="6.959">we are heading let&amp;#39;s go back to post</text>
  <text start="362.93" dur="5.849">26:35 because as we know as the Dems the</text>
  <text start="367.009" dur="4.741">deep state can cheat as they continually</text>
  <text start="368.779" dur="6.031">push this they are destroying themselves</text>
  <text start="371.75" dur="6.539">they are exposing themselves and this is</text>
  <text start="374.81" dur="7.44">also part of the plan think about these</text>
  <text start="378.289" dur="5.761">hearings America is watching and they</text>
  <text start="382.25" dur="3.84">can see how they continually change the</text>
  <text start="384.05" dur="5.64">rules or they didn&amp;#39;t want to abide by</text>
  <text start="386.09" dur="5.879">the rules and how they accelerated the</text>
  <text start="389.69" dur="4.71">impeachment process and where are the</text>
  <text start="391.969" dur="4.38">witnesses there were no witnesses you</text>
  <text start="394.4" dur="5.009">imagine if everyone went through a trial</text>
  <text start="396.349" dur="6.301">like that today it would throw us all</text>
  <text start="399.409" dur="7.35">the way back to the dark ages but post</text>
  <text start="402.65" dur="6.66">26:35 this was December 22 2018 it says</text>
  <text start="406.759" dur="6.78">the D Party will cease to exist</text>
  <text start="409.31" dur="5.969">once it&amp;#39;s all exposed fake news can no</text>
  <text start="413.539" dur="5.281">longer control dampen public awareness</text>
  <text start="415.279" dur="6.121">of the truth dark to light</text>
  <text start="418.82" dur="5.07">and yeah they are just they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="421.4" dur="5.28">destroying themselves there&amp;#39;s no other</text>
  <text start="423.89" dur="5.67">way to look at this because what they</text>
  <text start="426.68" dur="4.8">put on and what they showed America they</text>
  <text start="429.56" dur="5.37">showed America that they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="431.48" dur="7.49">about the rule of law now</text>
  <text start="434.93" dur="8.31">the GOP pushed Nadler to accepting a</text>
  <text start="438.97" dur="9.07">Ukrainian interference document in the</text>
  <text start="443.24" dur="6.66">2016 election by doing this it debunks</text>
  <text start="448.04" dur="5.07">all those who have said that the</text>
  <text start="449.9" dur="7.41">Ukrainian meddling was debunked now why</text>
  <text start="453.11" dur="6.87">would the GOP push so hard to get this</text>
  <text start="457.31" dur="5.9">into the impeachment record about</text>
  <text start="459.98" dur="6.51">Ukraine interfering in the 2016 election</text>

  <text start="884.68" dur="4.5">the FBI case was open this is important</text>
  <text start="887.8" dur="3.45">because the difference between the</text>

  <text start="903.88" dur="5.15">come from his contact with ambassador</text>

  <text start="929.47" dur="3.39">that Downer contact with the FBI</text>
  <text start="931.3" dur="4.26">initiated the investigation</text>
  <text start="932.86" dur="3.3">the only variable on the durmand is you</text>
  <text start="935.56" dur="4.83">got it</text>
  <text start="936.16" dur="6.36">Joseph Mifsud so if Durham is disputing</text>
  <text start="940.39" dur="4.26">the validity of predication and how the</text>

  <text start="947.07" dur="3.5">driving the dispute this almost</text>
  <text start="949.66" dur="3.88">guarantees that</text>
  <text start="950.57" dur="5.22">if Sud was not the Russian operative</text>
  <text start="953.54" dur="4.73">that current FBI and intelligent</text>

  <text start="962.06" dur="5.88">not in the CHS database but also Joseph</text>
  <text start="965.6" dur="6.81">Mifsud was not a Russian operative</text>
  <text start="967.94" dur="8.25">hence predicate issue so Durham knows a</text>
  <text start="972.41" dur="7.32">little bit more than Horowitz and he</text>
  <text start="976.19" dur="6.33">understands the big picture now we know</text>

  <text start="2078.21" dur="4.709">Horowitz is going to be testifying</text>
  <text start="2080.07" dur="5.64">tomorrow which is December 11th and we</text>
  <text start="2082.919" dur="5.821">know they most likely do not want people</text>
  <text start="2085.71" dur="5.07">to see his testimony because once again</text>
  <text start="2088.74" dur="3.09">remember when he testified in front of</text>
  <text start="2090.78" dur="3.72">Congress about Comey</text>
  <text start="2091.83" dur="4.74">and they asked him did you refer him to</text>
  <text start="2094.5" dur="4.83">the Department of Justice with criminal</text>
  <text start="2096.57" dur="5.84">charges and he said yes I did but the</text>
  <text start="2099.33" dur="7.35">Department of Justice rejected it I</text>
  <text start="2102.41" dur="5.74">don&amp;#39;t think with this report I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2106.68" dur="6.24">think the mainstream media the deep</text>
  <text start="2108.15" dur="5.9">state wants him heard and if it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2112.92" dur="3.6">going well</text>
  <text start="2114.05" dur="3.91">and he&amp;#39;s saying things they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="2116.52" dur="4.29">people to hear they&amp;#39;ll either cut away</text>
  <text start="2117.96" dur="5.07">or there might be an event we see a</text>
  <text start="2120.81" dur="4.71">shooting today which clogged up the news</text>
  <text start="2123.03" dur="4.56">cycles and of course they announced the</text>
  <text start="2125.52" dur="5.31">impeachment which they had no crime no</text>
  <text start="2127.59" dur="6.84">bribery no quid pro quo people are</text>
  <text start="2130.83" dur="6.81">discussing the Pfizer report and we had</text>
  <text start="2134.43" dur="5.04">a shooting to clog the news cycles and I</text>
  <text start="2137.64" dur="5.13">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if they had</text>
  <text start="2139.47" dur="6.14">something else happen tomorrow during</text>
  <text start="2142.77" dur="5.78">this period depending on how it all goes</text>
  <text start="2145.61" dur="6.95">now very interestingly bar was being</text>
  <text start="2148.55" dur="7.74">interviewed and he says that</text>
  <text start="2152.56" dur="6.16">investigations take time that we need to</text>
  <text start="2156.29" dur="5.24">gather the evidence make sense of the</text>
  <text start="2158.72" dur="5.31">information and that takes some time and</text>
  <text start="2161.53" dur="4">to indict someone the Department of</text>
  <text start="2164.03" dur="5.25">Justice needs proof beyond a reasonable</text>
  <text start="2165.53" dur="6.3">doubt that&amp;#39;s how they work and then they</text>
  <text start="2169.28" dur="5.97">go ahead and they unseal everything take</text>
  <text start="2171.83" dur="7.65">a listen to what he said text all of us</text>
  <text start="2175.25" dur="7.47">is that the government has to have proof</text>
  <text start="2179.48" dur="5.73">beyond a reasonable doubt at least under</text>
  <text start="2182.72" dur="4.65">Justice Department standards before we</text>
  <text start="2185.21" dur="5.7">indict anybody and that&amp;#39;s a pretty</text>
  <text start="2187.37" dur="5.79">substantial hurdle and no one is gonna</text>
  <text start="2190.91" dur="4.92">go to jail and no one&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="2193.16" dur="5.54">indicted in like unless that standard is</text>
  <text start="2195.83" dur="5.51">met now he&amp;#39;s letting everyone know that</text>
  <text start="2198.7" dur="6.31">people are going to be held accountable</text>
  <text start="2201.34" dur="6.01">this is not a false flag event where</text>
