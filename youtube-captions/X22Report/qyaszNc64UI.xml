  <text start="52.8" dur="5.22">hi and welcome you listening to the x-22</text>
  <text start="56.67" dur="4.86">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.02" dur="6.27">episode 1558 b and today&amp;#39;s date is May</text>
  <text start="61.53" dur="5.55">2nd 2018 and the thought of the episode</text>
  <text start="64.29" dur="6.18">is the plan is on schedule countries</text>
  <text start="67.08" dur="5.25">move to review the deal let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="70.47" dur="4.41">the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="72.33" dur="4.62">geopolitical news now the last couple of</text>
  <text start="74.88" dur="6.39">days we&amp;#39;ve been seeing in New York Times</text>
  <text start="76.95" dur="6.809">and other corporate media broadcast that</text>
  <text start="81.27" dur="4.8">Mueller has all these questions for</text>
  <text start="83.759" dur="3.961">Trump and you know it shows Russian</text>
  <text start="86.07" dur="4.68">collusion and everything like that and</text>
  <text start="87.72" dur="5.73">it looks like Trump actually and his</text>
  <text start="90.75" dur="5.1">team might have leaked Mueller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="93.45" dur="4.589">questions on purpose now</text>
  <text start="95.85" dur="7.17">these provide a fascinating insight into</text>
  <text start="98.039" dur="7.44">the state of Mueller&amp;#39;s inquiry Robert</text>
  <text start="103.02" dur="4.86">Mueller is in possession of no facts</text>
  <text start="105.479" dur="4.89">which have not previously been made</text>
  <text start="107.88" dur="4.95">public every single one of the questions</text>
  <text start="110.369" dur="4.771">is obviously drawn on information which</text>
  <text start="112.83" dur="6">has already been made public and which</text>
  <text start="115.14" dur="5.399">has been widely discussed and when we</text>
  <text start="118.83" dur="3.239">look at the questions we can see that a</text>
  <text start="120.539" dur="5.341">lot of these things are already out</text>
  <text start="122.069" dur="6.36">there now the New York Times is looking</text>
  <text start="125.88" dur="4.17">at one particular question and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="128.429" dur="4.261">making a really big deal about it what</text>
  <text start="130.05" dur="5.82">knowledge did you have of any outreach</text>
  <text start="132.69" dur="5.28">by your campaign including by Paul</text>
  <text start="135.87" dur="5.13">Manafort to Russia about potential</text>
  <text start="137.97" dur="7.11">assistance to the campaign now</text>
  <text start="141" dur="6.239">concerning the question here New York</text>
  <text start="145.08" dur="5.58">Times saying that this is one of the</text>
  <text start="147.239" dur="5.191">most intriguing questions on the list it</text>
  <text start="150.66" dur="4.439">is not clear whether mr. Mueller knows</text>
  <text start="152.43" dur="4.08">something new but there is no publicly</text>
  <text start="155.099" dur="4.081">available information linking mr.</text>
  <text start="156.51" dur="5.91">Manafort the former campaign chairman to</text>
  <text start="159.18" dur="6.6">such outreach so his conclusion here is</text>
  <text start="162.42" dur="6.03">significant mr. manna for its long time</text>
  <text start="165.78" dur="6.45">colleague Rick Gates is cooperating with</text>
  <text start="168.45" dur="5.69">mr. Mueller and it looks like this is</text>
  <text start="172.23" dur="5.009">something that needs to be answered and</text>
  <text start="174.14" dur="4.72">when you really look at it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="177.239" dur="5.241">saying that there&amp;#39;s no public</text>
  <text start="178.86" dur="7.35">information there&amp;#39;s nothing here but</text>
  <text start="182.48" dur="6.52">there is public information out there it</text>
  <text start="186.21" dur="5.58">existed since the summer 2016 and it was</text>
  <text start="189" dur="5.49">made publicly available in February 2017</text>
  <text start="191.79" dur="5.43">and has been the subject of exhaustive</text>
  <text start="194.49" dur="5.13">discussion ever since it is of course</text>
  <text start="197.22" dur="4.53">the Trump dossier in which mana four</text>
  <text start="199.62" dur="4.35">plays a starring role as the mastermind</text>
  <text start="201.75" dur="4.86">of the supposed conspiracy between the</text>
  <text start="203.97" dur="5.34">Trump campaign and Russia it seems that</text>
  <text start="206.61" dur="5.73">now that the Trump dossier is publicly</text>
  <text start="209.31" dur="5.97">discredited the New York Times treats it</text>
  <text start="212.34" dur="4.26">as if it doesn&amp;#39;t exist and we need to</text>
  <text start="215.28" dur="6.48">understand and this is also coming from</text>
  <text start="216.6" dur="8.04">Q remember Muller Rosenstein they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="221.76" dur="5.61">saying that Trump is not the target of</text>
  <text start="224.64" dur="5.58">the Muller investigation but when you</text>
  <text start="227.37" dur="5.46">read the questions it seems like he is</text>
  <text start="230.22" dur="4.17">the target of the investigation and it</text>
  <text start="232.83" dur="4.26">looks like it has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="234.39" dur="5.28">collusion or Russian collusion it looks</text>
  <text start="237.09" dur="3.36">like they&amp;#39;re trying to push obstruction</text>
  <text start="239.67" dur="3.17">of justice</text>
  <text start="240.45" dur="4.35">and it looks like it has replaced</text>
  <text start="242.84" dur="6.91">collusion with obstruction of justice</text>
  <text start="244.8" dur="8.4">and basically Muller is pushing this</text>
  <text start="249.75" dur="5.52">idea now we have to remember they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="253.2" dur="3.12">trying to figure out a way to get Trump</text>
  <text start="255.27" dur="3.029">they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out a way to</text>
  <text start="256.32" dur="3.69">get them for lying they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="258.299" dur="2.94">figure out everything they possibly can</text>
  <text start="260.01" dur="3.27">now remember the House Intelligence</text>
  <text start="261.239" dur="4.411">Committee they reported that there was</text>
  <text start="263.28" dur="5.13">no collusion whatsoever and the question</text>
  <text start="265.65" dur="4.53">always comes back you know if there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="268.41" dur="6.3">collusion what is Muller doing there</text>
  <text start="270.18" dur="6.9">well why is he pushing his investigation</text>
  <text start="274.71" dur="4.74">if they already concluded that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.08" dur="4.02">no collusion he was actually hired</text>
  <text start="279.45" dur="3.75">because people thought there was</text>
  <text start="281.1" dur="4.05">collusion and he&amp;#39;s been there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="283.2" dur="3.69">been investigating trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="285.15" dur="5.52">and trying to find something for a very</text>
  <text start="286.89" dur="6.36">long time and nothing has been found so</text>
  <text start="290.67" dur="4.86">this is kind of odd and strange but</text>
  <text start="293.25" dur="5.55">again this is all part of the plan to</text>
  <text start="295.53" dur="5.64">keep everyone very busy especially in</text>
  <text start="298.8" dur="4.77">the corporate media and to keep everyone</text>
  <text start="301.17" dur="6.69">focused on other things while other</text>
  <text start="303.57" dur="9.89">things happen in the background we know</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="9.059">that Flynn according to Q post 1281 that</text>
  <text start="313.46" dur="6.62">Flynn is going to be done in 30 30 days</text>
  <text start="316.919" dur="5.59">so that was April 27th so by the end of</text>
  <text start="320.08" dur="3.959">a we should see something happening with</text>
  <text start="322.509" dur="4.111">Flynn now what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="324.039" dur="5.551">Flynn is that Special Counsel Robert</text>
  <text start="326.62" dur="4.47">Mueller requested that sentencing for</text>
  <text start="329.59" dur="5.4">former Trump national security adviser</text>
  <text start="331.09" dur="5.629">Michael Flynn be delayed by at least two</text>
  <text start="334.99" dur="5.85">months</text>
  <text start="336.719" dur="7.241">so Mueller&amp;#39;s team and attorneys for</text>
  <text start="340.84" dur="5.819">Flynn submitted that Flynn is not ready</text>
  <text start="343.96" dur="5.549">for sentencing due to the status of the</text>
  <text start="346.659" dur="6.031">special counsels investigation so it</text>
  <text start="349.509" dur="4.62">looks like Mueller is requesting to push</text>
  <text start="352.69" dur="1.949">this off they really have nothing on</text>
  <text start="354.129" dur="4.051">Flynn</text>
  <text start="354.639" dur="6.691">he didn&amp;#39;t line and again if they bring</text>
  <text start="358.18" dur="5.37">the text messages up if we bring up who</text>
  <text start="361.33" dur="5.04">actually interrogated Flynn and</text>
  <text start="363.55" dur="5.429">questioned him it comes back to stroszek</text>
  <text start="366.37" dur="4.859">comes back to page it comes back to the</text>
  <text start="368.979" dur="4.68">text messages it shows that they might</text>
  <text start="371.229" dur="4.951">have changed the text messages and this</text>
  <text start="373.659" dur="5.16">is where everything is starting to fall</text>
  <text start="376.18" dur="3.87">in place and this is why Q is out there</text>
  <text start="378.819" dur="3.361">saying that all this is going to be</text>
  <text start="380.05" dur="4.769">wrapped up done in 30 days we&amp;#39;ll wait</text>
  <text start="382.18" dur="5.239">and see but it looks like this whole</text>
  <text start="384.819" dur="8.16">trial with Flynn has been now pushed off</text>
  <text start="387.419" dur="7.9">for two months so again we can see that</text>
  <text start="392.979" dur="6.18">this done in 30 might come true just</text>
  <text start="395.319" dur="5.581">like Q is saying we see Facebook they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="399.159" dur="4.921">taking a completely different approach</text>
  <text start="400.9" dur="7.71">with who he should trust in regards to</text>
  <text start="404.08" dur="6.809">news now Facebook will now rank news by</text>
  <text start="408.61" dur="5.79">trustworthiness promoting or suppressing</text>
  <text start="410.889" dur="9.09">content based on this criterion now they</text>
  <text start="414.4" dur="8.609">asked users for their idea of who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="419.979" dur="6">trustworthy and they&amp;#39;re using this data</text>
  <text start="423.009" dur="7.77">and they&amp;#39;re going to use some AI to</text>
  <text start="425.979" dur="8.521">figure out which news outlets are the</text>
  <text start="430.779" dur="5.94">most trusted news outlets now again you</text>
  <text start="434.5" dur="6.349">really have to look at the pool that</text>
  <text start="436.719" dur="9.111">they&amp;#39;re choosing from New York Times CNN</text>
  <text start="440.849" dur="7.6">The Wall Street Journal NBC Univision</text>
  <text start="445.83" dur="5.44">Barron&amp;#39;s Daily Beast&amp;#39;s The Economist</text>
  <text start="448.449" dur="5.46">Huffington Post Insider the Atlantic New</text>
  <text start="451.27" dur="4.829">York Post and a couple of others</text>
  <text start="453.909" dur="5.22">basically they&amp;#39;re all pretty much the</text>
  <text start="456.099" dur="3.93">same players they all report on the same</text>
  <text start="459.129" dur="4.35">exact thing</text>
  <text start="460.029" dur="7.04">most of them reporting on fake news so</text>
  <text start="463.479" dur="7.56">does it really matter who&amp;#39;s trustworthy</text>
  <text start="467.069" dur="6.1">because basically they gave them here</text>
  <text start="471.039" dur="6.87">are the news outlets which ones do you</text>
  <text start="473.169" dur="9.441">think is the most trusted and people are</text>
  <text start="477.909" dur="7.35">choosing but they already decided that</text>
  <text start="482.61" dur="4.72">these are the only ones that you can</text>
  <text start="485.259" dur="5.071">choose from now if someone puts up an</text>
  <text start="487.33" dur="6">article from an alternative media site</text>
  <text start="490.33" dur="6.119">guess what that doesn&amp;#39;t fit into any of</text>
  <text start="493.33" dur="4.589">these so they&amp;#39;re less trustworthy they</text>
  <text start="496.449" dur="3.33">don&amp;#39;t even have to vote they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="497.919" dur="3.36">to do anything people will already note</text>
  <text start="499.779" dur="4.44">this now they&amp;#39;ll probably put a gauge</text>
  <text start="501.279" dur="5.34">saying that you know on our on our scale</text>
  <text start="504.219" dur="4.5">the trustworthiness is very low because</text>
  <text start="506.619" dur="4.26">this is what the people voted on but</text>
  <text start="508.719" dur="3.36">again they handed them the news sources</text>
  <text start="510.879" dur="3.09">they didn&amp;#39;t go to every single news</text>
  <text start="512.079" dur="4.62">source out there they went to the main</text>
  <text start="513.969" dur="5.161">ones and we can see this is how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="516.699" dur="4.921">playing the game now let&amp;#39;s go out to the</text>
  <text start="519.13" dur="4.199">UK and talk about the scruple case it</text>
  <text start="521.62" dur="4.409">looks like it&amp;#39;s fallen by the wayside</text>
  <text start="523.329" dur="4.351">and the British authorities they&amp;#39;ve come</text>
  <text start="526.029" dur="3.42">up empty-handed now a couple of reports</text>
  <text start="527.68" dur="4.079">ago we talked about how they had this</text>
  <text start="529.449" dur="4.801">digitized picture from the CCTV cameras</text>
  <text start="531.759" dur="3.991">saying we found the suspect and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="534.25" dur="2.88">been trying to match this up and they</text>
  <text start="535.75" dur="2.939">just can&amp;#39;t match it to anyone of course</text>
  <text start="537.13" dur="4.17">it was completely fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="538.689" dur="4.411">but what we do realize and this is very</text>
  <text start="541.3" dur="4.74">important is that we haven&amp;#39;t heard</text>
  <text start="543.1" dur="5.669">anything from Yulia or Sergey what</text>
  <text start="546.04" dur="5.34">happened to them remember you Lea Yulia</text>
  <text start="548.769" dur="5.88">she was trying to get in touch with her</text>
  <text start="551.38" dur="4.559">fiance and the fiance didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="554.649" dur="5.67">call her back does that even make sense</text>
  <text start="555.939" dur="6.931">to you know they said Sergey was getting</text>
  <text start="560.319" dur="6.031">better he was making a strong recovery</text>
  <text start="562.87" dur="5.639">and now we&amp;#39;ve heard nothing was he</text>
  <text start="566.35" dur="4.56">discharged from the hospital was he</text>
  <text start="568.509" dur="4.14">taking someplace else we&amp;#39;ve had we</text>
  <text start="570.91" dur="4.32">haven&amp;#39;t heard a peep from these</text>
  <text start="572.649" dur="4.261">individuals which means something might</text>
  <text start="575.23" dur="3.93">have happened they said they were going</text>
  <text start="576.91" dur="5.31">to the into the witness protection plan</text>
  <text start="579.16" dur="6.239">which means they disappear and of course</text>
  <text start="582.22" dur="5.52">when they can&amp;#39;t keep the propaganda</text>
  <text start="585.399" dur="5.581">alive they need to get rid</text>
  <text start="587.74" dur="7.02">of the propaganda and that is Yulia and</text>
  <text start="590.98" dur="5.46">Sergei which they used as the propaganda</text>
  <text start="594.76" dur="5.49">saying that they were poisoned now</text>
  <text start="596.44" dur="5.01">everything is gone and they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="600.25" dur="4.62">to talk about it anymore</text>
  <text start="601.45" dur="5.94">so once again they got rid of all of it</text>
  <text start="604.87" dur="4.29">so nobody talks about it and they were</text>
  <text start="607.39" dur="3.03">making a really really big deal about it</text>
  <text start="609.16" dur="3.6">that was Russia and they did this and</text>
  <text start="610.42" dur="4.32">they did that and they can&amp;#39;t prove or</text>
  <text start="612.76" dur="5.07">show anything because we know it&amp;#39;s fake</text>
  <text start="614.74" dur="4.98">phony and false we see right now the</text>
  <text start="617.83" dur="3.99">u.s. and North Korea they&amp;#39;re designing</text>
  <text start="619.72" dur="5.22">on two different sites of where to hold</text>
  <text start="621.82" dur="5.34">the summit we also see that the North</text>
  <text start="624.94" dur="4.74">now is dismantling their border</text>
  <text start="627.16" dur="4.43">loudspeakers same as the South those</text>
  <text start="629.68" dur="4.8">things are going very very smoothly and</text>
  <text start="631.59" dur="4.69">Trump right now it looks like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="634.48" dur="3.6">getting his way with North Korea</text>
  <text start="636.28" dur="3.72">it looks like North Korea has reportedly</text>
  <text start="638.08" dur="4.8">released three American prisoners held</text>
  <text start="640" dur="7.08">in labor camps and relocated them to the</text>
  <text start="642.88" dur="9.03">capital and they released Kim dong-chul</text>
  <text start="647.08" dur="7.56">Kim sang deuk and Kim cake hack song and</text>
  <text start="651.91" dur="5.28">they were previously imprisoned at labor</text>
  <text start="654.64" dur="4.98">camps there are three American hostages</text>
  <text start="657.19" dur="7.44">and they&amp;#39;re staying in a hotel in the</text>
  <text start="659.62" dur="7.29">capital and Kim dong-chul he was a</text>
  <text start="664.63" dur="4.32">Korean American businessman and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="666.91" dur="3.81">been detained in North Korea since 2015</text>
  <text start="668.95" dur="4.17">he was arrested and charged with</text>
  <text start="670.72" dur="4.98">espionage for his crimes he was</text>
  <text start="673.12" dur="4.02">sentenced to 10 years of hard labor Kim</text>
  <text start="675.7" dur="5.01">hak Song and Kim</text>
  <text start="677.14" dur="5.9">sang deuk they were both professors in</text>
  <text start="680.71" dur="5.16">the university of science and technology</text>
  <text start="683.04" dur="5.62">they are both detained in 2017 for</text>
  <text start="685.87" dur="5.37">hostile acts of an unspecified nature</text>
  <text start="688.66" dur="5.73">and these individuals are now being</text>
  <text start="691.24" dur="6.36">released so this is another win in the</text>

  <text start="723.699" dur="6.69">I think they&amp;#39;re basically doing this to</text>
  <text start="726.849" dur="8.76">basically have chaos in the region to</text>
  <text start="730.389" dur="7.95">perform their operations in Syria with a</text>

  <text start="738.339" dur="3.9">violating the nuclear deal no I think</text>
  <text start="739.959" dur="7.53">what is happening is Iran is the cover</text>
  <text start="742.239" dur="8.16">and below the cover is the real mission</text>
  <text start="747.489" dur="4.32">and that is to get the deep state to get</text>
  <text start="750.399" dur="3.66">what is going on just like North Korea</text>
  <text start="751.809" dur="4.14">North Korea wasn&amp;#39;t the problem it was</text>
  <text start="754.059" dur="3.6">the deep state the clowns of the</text>
  <text start="755.949" dur="3.63">intelligence agencies that they were</text>
  <text start="757.659" dur="4.47">moving in on the same thing is happening</text>
  <text start="759.579" dur="4.53">here and this is why we have all of this</text>
  <text start="762.129" dur="3.51">happening in Syria this is why there are</text>
  <text start="764.109" dur="4.5">certain areas that are very very</text>
  <text start="765.639" dur="5.01">protected because the deep state knows</text>
  <text start="768.609" dur="4.38">they can&amp;#39;t let anyone find out what has</text>
  <text start="770.649" dur="5.37">been going on in these areas</text>
  <text start="772.989" dur="5.4">the ICRC which is the International</text>
  <text start="776.019" dur="6.48">Committee of the Red Cross said there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="778.389" dur="7.74">no signs of systemic balkanization in</text>
  <text start="782.499" dur="6.66">Syria and they&amp;#39;re seeing nothing that</text>
  <text start="786.129" dur="5.76">shows them that they&amp;#39;re trying to divvy</text>
  <text start="789.159" dur="4.23">Syria up at this point and we know this</text>
  <text start="791.889" dur="3.39">was the deep state&amp;#39;s plan from the very</text>
  <text start="793.389" dur="3.87">very beginning where they were gonna go</text>
  <text start="795.279" dur="3.93">in there make a Kurdish region make a</text>
  <text start="797.259" dur="3.75">Sunni region make a shear region and</text>
  <text start="799.209" dur="2.76">they were gonna do this in Iraq they</text>
  <text start="801.009" dur="2.4">were gonna do this tour with the other</text>
  <text start="801.969" dur="3.51">Middle Eastern countries</text>
  <text start="803.409" dur="4.68">this way they can control all these</text>
  <text start="805.479" dur="6.33">different areas and this isn&amp;#39;t happening</text>
  <text start="808.089" dur="7.38">now we know from q the end from</text>
  <text start="811.809" dur="6.24">Netanyahu they were out there saying</text>
  <text start="815.469" dur="5.55">that the Iran deal and also from Trump</text>
  <text start="818.049" dur="6">that this is no good</text>
  <text start="821.019" dur="6.24">Iran has been violating it and it looks</text>
  <text start="824.049" dur="6.6">like Trump and the Patriots are using</text>
  <text start="827.259" dur="7.14">Netanyahu right now to push this agenda</text>
  <text start="830.649" dur="6.48">by taking all these documents and saying</text>
  <text start="834.399" dur="5.61">see how they violated and of course most</text>
  <text start="837.129" dur="4.44">of it are completely meaningless a lot</text>
  <text start="840.009" dur="2.76">of individuals are looking at it saying</text>
  <text start="841.569" dur="3.87">this doesn&amp;#39;t show that they violated</text>
  <text start="842.769" dur="4.95">anything and again we know the IAEA is</text>
  <text start="845.439" dur="4.35">the only body that can say yes they</text>
  <text start="847.719" dur="6.451">violated yes or no they didn&amp;#39;t violate</text>
  <text start="849.789" dur="8.04">it this is being pushed too</text>
  <text start="854.17" dur="5.609">get Congress other countries to look at</text>
  <text start="857.829" dur="3.931">the Iranian deal remember Obama set this</text>
  <text start="859.779" dur="5.091">up Carrie set this up with other</text>
  <text start="861.76" dur="7.11">countries with Europe and they had</text>
  <text start="864.87" dur="5.44">different clauses different information</text>
  <text start="868.87" dur="6.93">in there that Congress was not allowed</text>
  <text start="870.31" dur="8.579">to see and this was to push funds out</text>
  <text start="875.8" dur="7.56">into the deep state&amp;#39;s pocket to push</text>
  <text start="878.889" dur="5.971">their agenda in other places and this is</text>
  <text start="883.36" dur="3.2">what is happening right now now we</text>
  <text start="884.86" dur="6.779">already have Germans</text>
  <text start="886.56" dur="6.79">Germany&amp;#39;s foreign minister Heiko Maas he</text>
  <text start="891.639" dur="4.711">is calling on the International Atomic</text>
  <text start="893.35" dur="6.72">Energy Agency the IAEA to review</text>
  <text start="896.35" dur="5.729">Israelis accusations against Iran and I</text>
  <text start="900.07" dur="4.199">think this is all that Trump and the</text>
  <text start="902.079" dur="6.301">Patriots wanted them to do was to look</text>
  <text start="904.269" dur="6.271">into the Iranian deal now the IAEA in</text>
  <text start="908.38" dur="5.79">Iran is going to come back and say we</text>
  <text start="910.54" dur="7.2">haven&amp;#39;t found anything but the countries</text>
  <text start="914.17" dur="7.77">they want to look into the deal they</text>
  <text start="917.74" dur="6.3">want to see what specifically has been</text>
  <text start="921.94" dur="4.8">going on here and I believe that</text>
  <text start="924.04" dur="5.489">Congress is eventually going to say</text>
  <text start="926.74" dur="4.5">let&amp;#39;s look into this and I think this is</text>
  <text start="929.529" dur="4.8">where they&amp;#39;re pushing them because they</text>
  <text start="931.24" dur="5.219">want them to find out what has been</text>
  <text start="934.329" dur="5.101">going on now Trump is doing what he did</text>
  <text start="936.459" dur="5.281">with North Korea Trump says he saw parts</text>
  <text start="939.43" dur="4.95">of Netanyahu Netanyahu&amp;#39;s speech on Iran</text>
  <text start="941.74" dur="4.909">he declined to say what he&amp;#39;ll do on</text>
  <text start="944.38" dur="6.18">Iran&amp;#39;s nuclear deal</text>
  <text start="946.649" dur="8.651">he leaves the possibility open of</text>
  <text start="950.56" dur="8.31">negotiating a new Iranian deal and again</text>
  <text start="955.3" dur="6.539">he wants others to say let&amp;#39;s look into</text>
  <text start="958.87" dur="4.92">it he wants others to find out what he</text>
  <text start="961.839" dur="4.291">already knows because he&amp;#39;s already seen</text>
  <text start="963.79" dur="4.859">it this is why he&amp;#39;s out there pushing</text>
  <text start="966.13" dur="5.189">for a new Iranian deal he already knows</text>
  <text start="968.649" dur="8.101">what is going on and this is why q keeps</text>
  <text start="971.319" dur="9.601">saying we already know everything and we</text>
  <text start="976.75" dur="6.72">want others to figure it out and the</text>
  <text start="980.92" dur="4.859">only way to do this is to get someone in</text>
  <text start="983.47" dur="4.33">other countries in Congress and say</text>
  <text start="985.779" dur="5.021">let&amp;#39;s look at the Iranian deal</text>
  <text start="987.8" dur="5.849">let&amp;#39;s get rid of the security part and</text>
  <text start="990.8" dur="6.139">let&amp;#39;s see what&amp;#39;s in there and this is</text>
  <text start="993.649" dur="7.771">what he&amp;#39;s been driving them to do and</text>
  <text start="996.939" dur="7.661">again to get these individuals you need</text>
  <text start="1001.42" dur="5.519">to follow certain procedures this is not</text>
  <text start="1004.6" dur="5.099">about propaganda this is not about just</text>
  <text start="1006.939" dur="4.291">swooping in like the deep state does and</text>
  <text start="1009.699" dur="3.69">says they&amp;#39;re guilty throw them away</text>
  <text start="1011.23" dur="4.589">or set using let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s take for</text>
  <text start="1013.389" dur="5.401">example the scribble case saying that</text>
  <text start="1015.819" dur="4.92">Russia did it they poisoned him we have</text>
  <text start="1018.79" dur="4.859">to show no evidence and then all of a</text>
  <text start="1020.739" dur="4.71">sudden the scribbles disappear and the</text>
  <text start="1023.649" dur="4.831">world the corporate media is all out</text>
  <text start="1025.449" dur="5.1">there backing the UK up and countries</text>
  <text start="1028.48" dur="6.209">are backing them up without any evidence</text>
  <text start="1030.549" dur="6.931">whatsoever nothing tying Russia to any</text>
  <text start="1034.689" dur="6.661">of this except Nova truck which anyone</text>
  <text start="1037.48" dur="6.059">can develop in the real world and if you</text>
  <text start="1041.35" dur="4.349">could really want to take people down</text>
  <text start="1043.539" dur="4.591">and you want to show this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1045.699" dur="4.2">guilty and to prove to people this is</text>
  <text start="1048.13" dur="3.96">why they&amp;#39;re guilty and put them onto</text>
  <text start="1049.899" dur="2.76">trial to show the world this is what</text>
  <text start="1052.09" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="1052.659" dur="7.201">you need the paperwork you need the</text>
  <text start="1056.23" dur="5.97">links you need an airtight case and you</text>
  <text start="1059.86" dur="5.84">need to show what they have done and</text>
  <text start="1062.2" dur="6.68">what they created in respects to</text>
  <text start="1065.7" dur="7.3">laundering money human trafficking</text>
  <text start="1068.88" dur="7.6">pedophilia drug trafficking arms</text>
  <text start="1073" dur="6.029">trafficking I mean you need to show all</text>
  <text start="1076.48" dur="5.49">of this what they&amp;#39;ve done with the</text>
  <text start="1079.029" dur="5.701">uranium who they made deals with who</text>
  <text start="1081.97" dur="5.25">they colluded with all of this needs to</text>
  <text start="1084.73" dur="4.38">be documented all of this needs to be</text>
  <text start="1087.22" dur="4.53">put together and this is what is</text>
  <text start="1089.11" dur="4.799">happening right now and you need others</text>
  <text start="1091.75" dur="4.83">to see this you just can&amp;#39;t do it on your</text>
  <text start="1093.909" dur="3.931">own you need Congress to say you know</text>
  <text start="1096.58" dur="3.5">something let&amp;#39;s see the rest of this</text>
  <text start="1097.84" dur="5.73">deal let&amp;#39;s see what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="1100.08" dur="5.29">let&amp;#39;s remove the classification let form</text>
  <text start="1103.57" dur="3.27">a committee let&amp;#39;s see let a couple of</text>
  <text start="1105.37" dur="4.289">people see if they did this with the</text>
  <text start="1106.84" dur="3.39">FISA warrants and they found out wait a</text>
  <text start="1109.659" dur="3.181">minute</text>
  <text start="1110.23" dur="5.159">this wasn&amp;#39;t legal look what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="1112.84" dur="4.049">here and other people started to read</text>
  <text start="1115.389" dur="3.811">the memos people started to read the</text>
  <text start="1116.889" dur="4.561">documents they were ordering unredacted</text>
  <text start="1119.2" dur="2.7">documents and they were putting all the</text>
  <text start="1121.45" dur="4.02">pieces</text>
  <text start="1121.9" dur="5.46">together this is what Q is been saying</text>
  <text start="1125.47" dur="4.56">and this is what has been happening</text>
  <text start="1127.36" dur="5.64">right now where they&amp;#39;re trying to build</text>
  <text start="1130.03" dur="4.77">this case so the plan is on schedule and</text>
  <text start="1133" dur="3.06">it looks like other countries are</text>
  <text start="1134.8" dur="2.64">looking into this which means other</text>
  <text start="1136.06" dur="2.91">countries are gonna be looking into this</text>
  <text start="1137.44" dur="3.03">which means Congress finally is going to</text>
  <text start="1138.97" dur="3.51">be looking into this so it looks like</text>
  <text start="1140.47" dur="5.1">this is where this is all headed now</text>
  <text start="1142.48" dur="6.83">very interestingly a US military c-130</text>
  <text start="1145.57" dur="8.55">plane crashed near Savannah Airport in</text>
  <text start="1149.31" dur="6.78">Georgia and again this is very odd and</text>
  <text start="1154.12" dur="5.34">strange because we&amp;#39;ve seen this before</text>
  <text start="1156.09" dur="5.26">where the deep state and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="1159.46" dur="4.32">they battle behind the scenes where they</text>
  <text start="1161.35" dur="5.46">knock out certain military planes they</text>
  <text start="1163.78" dur="5.55">crash ships they they bring down other</text>
  <text start="1166.81" dur="4.65">planes we also see another south western</text>
  <text start="1169.33" dur="4.32">airline where something happened with</text>
  <text start="1171.46" dur="4.68">the window which is also very very</text>
  <text start="1173.65" dur="4.82">strange so all of this is happening all</text>
  <text start="1176.14" dur="5.79">at once and we can see the the</text>
  <text start="1178.47" dur="5.26">infighting is continuing and the deep</text>
  <text start="1181.93" dur="4.04">state is definitely getting very very</text>
  <text start="1183.73" dur="4.8">nervous because what we see here is that</text>
  <text start="1185.97" dur="3.67">the House Intelligence Committee came</text>
  <text start="1188.53" dur="4.35">back and said there was no Russian</text>
  <text start="1189.64" dur="5.64">collusion Mueller his time is almost</text>
  <text start="1192.88" dur="4.14">done because because the questions that</text>
  <text start="1195.28" dur="3.84">were released that leaked on purpose</text>
  <text start="1197.02" dur="4.62">show this has nothing to do with Russian</text>
  <text start="1199.12" dur="4.62">collusion we also see that the</text>
  <text start="1201.64" dur="5.01">investigation with the uranium one the</text>
  <text start="1203.74" dur="4.17">investigation with human trafficking the</text>
  <text start="1206.65" dur="2.61">investigation with pretty much</text>
  <text start="1207.91" dur="3.03">everything else the emails and</text>
  <text start="1209.26" dur="3.87">everything like that they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="1210.94" dur="5.94">lead up to what has been happening out</text>
  <text start="1213.13" dur="6.03">in Syria with Russia with uranium with</text>
  <text start="1216.88" dur="4.65">war and what they&amp;#39;ve been planning to do</text>
  <text start="1219.16" dur="5.28">with all this money and what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1221.53" dur="6.3">been funding so a lot of information is</text>
  <text start="1224.44" dur="6.51">coming out and once Muller is out of the</text>
  <text start="1227.83" dur="5.94">way once Flynn has been shown that he</text>
  <text start="1230.95" dur="5.4">did nothing wrong whatsoever guess what</text>
  <text start="1233.77" dur="5.49">it&amp;#39;s going to get a lot worse for the</text>
  <text start="1236.35" dur="5.73">deep State and they&amp;#39;re gonna resort to</text>

  <text start="1245.8" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re blocked in North Korea I mean</text>
  <text start="1249.46" dur="3.69">there&amp;#39;s peace talks going on right now</text>
