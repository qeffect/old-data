  <text start="162.29" dur="7.919">my gut just tells me something bad is on</text>
  <text start="167" dur="7.73">the horizon with all this news that is</text>
  <text start="170.209" dur="7.59">coming out and hopefully i can relate</text>
  <text start="174.73" dur="6.759">what i&amp;#39;m reading to you and what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="177.799" dur="6.871">seeing to you know what what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="181.489" dur="6.42">expecting to happen but the first thing</text>
  <text start="184.67" dur="7.14">I mean of course is Cypress I mean look</text>
  <text start="187.909" dur="7.021">at this little tiny country and the</text>
  <text start="191.81" dur="5.879">banks are still closed people are</text>
  <text start="194.93" dur="4.02">getting more and more angry I mean they</text>
  <text start="197.689" dur="4.291">were calm in the beginning but now</text>
  <text start="198.95" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re getting more angry and they the</text>
  <text start="201.98" dur="2.7">banks are going to be closed i think</text>
  <text start="203.18" dur="3.66">until monday they&amp;#39;re trying to work out</text>
  <text start="204.68" dur="5.58">a deal but it looks like they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="206.84" dur="9.03">back to stealing the wealth of the</text>
  <text start="210.26" dur="8.58">people and i just it just it seems like</text>
  <text start="215.87" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re getting nowhere and it even</text>
  <text start="218.84" dur="4.019">looks like they&amp;#39;re going to steal the</text>
  <text start="220.76" dur="6.449">wealth or they&amp;#39;re just going to collapse</text>
  <text start="222.859" dur="9.63">and I read this article in MarketWatch</text>
  <text start="227.209" dur="9">where they were saying that that they</text>
  <text start="232.489" dur="7.17">need some type of bailout now if they</text>
  <text start="236.209" dur="7.231">don&amp;#39;t get a bailout the country the</text>
  <text start="239.659" dur="9.29">banks will have to collapse and they</text>
  <text start="243.44" dur="9.449">will have to get out of the euro and</text>
  <text start="248.949" dur="6.88">create their own currency and this is</text>
  <text start="252.889" dur="5.611">what they&amp;#39;re saying would which this is</text>
  <text start="255.829" dur="6.84">their scenario what would happen and how</text>
  <text start="258.5" dur="6.93">it would affect the European nation so</text>
  <text start="262.669" dur="6.631">if they do collapse what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="265.43" dur="4.95">is that the new currency would rapidly</text>
  <text start="269.3" dur="5.91">depreciate</text>
  <text start="270.38" dur="7.05">and the government debt is denominated</text>
  <text start="275.21" dur="4.71">in Euros the debt pile would rise in the</text>
  <text start="277.43" dur="6.39">new currency eventually leading to an</text>
  <text start="279.92" dur="5.19">unavoidable debt rescheduling and what</text>
  <text start="283.82" dur="3.18">does this mean for the eurozone</text>
  <text start="285.11" dur="4.2">countries they&amp;#39;re saying that a whole</text>
  <text start="287" dur="5.16">lot pretty much what Ben Bernanke saying</text>
  <text start="289.31" dur="5.22">for the u.s. that if something happens</text>
  <text start="292.16" dur="6.36">to them it&amp;#39;s not a big deal you know</text>
  <text start="294.53" dur="7.74">because it&amp;#39;s only 14 billion and it</text>
  <text start="298.52" dur="6.5">wouldn&amp;#39;t affect anything and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.27" dur="6.27">nothing to worry about there there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="305.02" dur="5.32">there&amp;#39;s absolutely you know nothing will</text>
  <text start="308.54" dur="5.07">happen just saying basically nothing</text>
  <text start="310.34" dur="7.47">will happen but I see it a different way</text>
  <text start="313.61" dur="6.81">yes from that perspective nothing but</text>
  <text start="317.81" dur="6.6">what about when people start to see this</text>
  <text start="320.42" dur="7.29">and see what they&amp;#39;re doing and people</text>
  <text start="324.41" dur="6.39">say hmm just a minute here you know they</text>
  <text start="327.71" dur="5.25">they took their money they collapsed</text>
  <text start="330.8" dur="4.35">maybe I should take my money out of the</text>
  <text start="332.96" dur="6.57">bank I mean this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="335.15" dur="6.69">today is that is that people are not</text>
  <text start="339.53" dur="5.61">sitting still anymore they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="341.84" dur="5.43">the bank and withdrawing money I mean I</text>
  <text start="345.14" dur="5.07">personally and withdrawing money because</text>
  <text start="347.27" dur="5.4">I hate to say it I don&amp;#39;t make any</text>
  <text start="350.21" dur="5.16">interest on eat on my money in the bank</text>
  <text start="352.67" dur="5.73">so you know what am I really getting</text>
  <text start="355.37" dur="4.5">their protection not really the people</text>
  <text start="358.4" dur="6.87">in Cyprus thought they were protected</text>
  <text start="359.87" dur="8.01">but the protection from robbers with</text>
  <text start="365.27" dur="4.95">guns coming into the bank and stealing</text>
  <text start="367.88" dur="6.14">the money yeah they might be protected</text>
  <text start="370.22" dur="7.71">that way but on the back end the actual</text>
  <text start="374.02" dur="6.51">bankers are now banksters and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="377.93" dur="6.6">taking the money from the back end and</text>
  <text start="380.53" dur="6.55">there&amp;#39;s really nothing you can do and I</text>
  <text start="384.53" dur="5.25">know yes I was ill it&amp;#39;s the FDIC we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="387.08" dur="5.16">insured here in the US but yesterday I</text>
  <text start="389.78" dur="4.13">went through it the FDIC does not have</text>
  <text start="392.24" dur="4.05">enough money to cover everything</text>
  <text start="393.91" dur="6.78">insurance does not work that way</text>
  <text start="396.29" dur="7.69">insurance only has enough to cover small</text>
  <text start="400.69" dur="7.82">incidents not on a major scale</text>
  <text start="403.98" dur="7.8">they just do not work that way now</text>
  <text start="408.51" dur="5.43">moving on you know there&amp;#39;s news now</text>
  <text start="411.78" dur="6.17">coming out we heard about Syrian and the</text>
  <text start="413.94" dur="7.11">chemical weapons and we hear about them</text>
  <text start="417.95" dur="5.5">you know the saying that either side has</text>
  <text start="421.05" dur="6.35">chemical weapons we don&amp;#39;t know which but</text>
  <text start="423.45" dur="7.83">we&amp;#39;re also seeing the u.s. kind of</text>
  <text start="427.4" dur="6.31">pushing China and you know the United</text>
  <text start="431.28" dur="5.88">States is coming in to talk to Japan</text>
  <text start="433.71" dur="4.95">about the island and stuff and and China</text>
  <text start="437.16" dur="3.36">doesn&amp;#39;t like this and it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="438.66" dur="5.87">push them and they&amp;#39;re feeling a little</text>
  <text start="440.52" dur="7.2">uneasy about this you know that china is</text>
  <text start="444.53" dur="4.57">extremely concerned by these reports the</text>
  <text start="447.72" dur="3.42">Chinese government has the determination</text>
  <text start="449.1" dur="5.64">ability to maintain the nations to</text>
  <text start="451.14" dur="6.48">territorial sovereignty and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="454.74" dur="5.31">feeling outside pressure but I believe</text>
  <text start="457.62" dur="8.06">we&amp;#39;re trying to bring in the pressure</text>
  <text start="460.05" dur="9.59">because the way it works is we will not</text>
  <text start="465.68" dur="6.43">make the first move we want other</text>
  <text start="469.64" dur="6.03">countries to make the first move so we</text>
  <text start="472.11" dur="6">can always say see look what they did I</text>

  <text start="502.98" dur="6.21">pushing and pushing and pushing waiting</text>
  <text start="505.59" dur="4.71">for someone to make the first move and I</text>
