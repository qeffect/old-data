  <text start="32.309" dur="5.46">today&amp;#39;s date is March 10th 2014 and the</text>
  <text start="35.46" dur="5.19">title this episode is Libya and Ukraine</text>
  <text start="37.769" dur="5.011">crisis might ignite the dollar reset</text>
  <text start="40.65" dur="4.29">because what do we know well we</text>
  <text start="42.78" dur="4.26">understand that the Empire of the United</text>
  <text start="44.94" dur="5.039">States the central bankers are spread</text>
  <text start="47.04" dur="5.28">very thin across the globe at this time</text>
  <text start="49.979" dur="4.4">we are in when I say we we have the</text>
  <text start="52.32" dur="5.55">central bankers United States are in</text>
  <text start="54.379" dur="6.511">Africa or in Thailand Tunisia we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="57.87" dur="7.05">the entire Middle East we&amp;#39;re in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="60.89" dur="5.71">we&amp;#39;re in Venezuela where the United</text>
  <text start="64.92" dur="4.739">States and the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="66.6" dur="6.24">trying to maintain the dollar and keep</text>
  <text start="69.659" dur="5.221">it propped up to get the war started</text>
  <text start="72.84" dur="4.5">this has been their agenda all along</text>
  <text start="74.88" dur="5.61">they do not want the collapse to come</text>
  <text start="77.34" dur="4.62">before they get the war started so they</text>
  <text start="80.49" dur="3.96">can blame this on another country</text>
  <text start="81.96" dur="5.579">because they do not want to be blamed</text>
  <text start="84.45" dur="5.76">for the entire economic collapse because</text>
  <text start="87.539" dur="5.851">you have to remember the IMF central</text>
  <text start="90.21" dur="5.759">bankers the Fed they&amp;#39;re all holding and</text>
  <text start="93.39" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re and the entire world well I should</text>
  <text start="95.969" dur="5.79">say the private western central bank</text>
  <text start="97.89" dur="7.68">world is doing what they say and if they</text>
  <text start="101.759" dur="6.691">let the system collapse everyone will be</text>
  <text start="105.57" dur="7.1">looking at them and blaming them for</text>
  <text start="108.45" dur="7.769">what is coming so their entire plan is</text>
  <text start="112.67" dur="6.64">to continually keep this dollar propped</text>
  <text start="116.219" dur="7.801">up for as long as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="119.31" dur="8.369">until they can start a war or to create</text>
  <text start="124.02" dur="6.209">an event that will start a war and we</text>
  <text start="127.679" dur="6.601">are seeing this unfold in front of our</text>
  <text start="130.229" dur="7.23">eyes right now we see what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="134.28" dur="4.62">in Ukraine we see what&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="137.459" dur="3.931">Libya and</text>
  <text start="138.9" dur="5.94">this is going to spread to other</text>
  <text start="141.39" dur="6.299">countries and again if we really look at</text>
  <text start="144.84" dur="7.56">this and we see what they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="147.689" dur="6.091">entire plan is not really going to work</text>
  <text start="152.4" dur="3.809">and I&amp;#39;ll explain that a little bit later</text>
  <text start="153.78" dur="5.069">in this report but let&amp;#39;s get into some</text>
  <text start="156.209" dur="4.681">of this economic collapse news and see</text>
  <text start="158.849" dur="5.67">what is going on elsewhere in the world</text>
  <text start="160.89" dur="5.129">and in the economy and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="164.519" dur="3.901">head out to Greece right now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="166.019" dur="4.321">seeing in Greece right now they need</text>
  <text start="168.42" dur="4.17">more bailouts of course they do because</text>
  <text start="170.34" dur="4.35">you know the first two doesn&amp;#39;t didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="172.59" dur="4.86">work and put them into more debt more</text>
  <text start="174.69" dur="4.919">people are unemployed they have higher</text>
  <text start="177.45" dur="4.679">interest payments and the country is</text>
  <text start="179.609" dur="5.1">suffering so what they need is another</text>
  <text start="182.129" dur="4.92">credit card to pay off the other credit</text>
  <text start="184.709" dur="4.59">cards so what they&amp;#39;re looking for is</text>
  <text start="187.049" dur="3.72">more den and right now the Greek</text>
  <text start="189.299" dur="3.931">government and the international</text>
  <text start="190.769" dur="3.72">creditors the European Commission the</text>
  <text start="193.23" dur="3.569">European Central Bank and the</text>
  <text start="194.489" dur="5.58">International Monetary Fund have failed</text>
  <text start="196.799" dur="5.881">to agree on a bailout loan tranche and</text>
  <text start="200.069" dur="4.17">again among the big issues that still</text>
  <text start="202.68" dur="3.75">need to be settled our banking capital</text>
  <text start="204.239" dur="4.771">requirements layoffs in the public</text>
  <text start="206.43" dur="5.459">sector and employers contributions</text>
  <text start="209.01" dur="6.509">because what the central bankers want is</text>
  <text start="211.889" dur="7.35">they want the real assets of the people</text>
  <text start="215.519" dur="7.05">they want the government to slash jobs /</text>
  <text start="219.239" dur="5.67">programs and have all the money flow up</text>
  <text start="222.569" dur="4.771">to them and this is what they do they go</text>
  <text start="224.909" dur="6.961">into a country they give the government</text>
  <text start="227.34" dur="6.359">paper money in exchange they take the</text>
  <text start="231.87" dur="5.64">assets and this is what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="233.699" dur="5.76">seeing all along now in Spain Spain is</text>
  <text start="237.51" dur="4.469">going to modify their bankruptcy laws</text>
  <text start="239.459" dur="4.74">and when they do this this will benefit</text>
  <text start="241.979" dur="3.75">the bankers of course it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="244.199" dur="3.6">benefit the companies it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="245.729" dur="5.88">benefit the people it always benefits</text>
  <text start="247.799" dur="5.37">the the bankers in the name of saving</text>
  <text start="251.609" dur="3.931">jobs the Spanish government had decided</text>
  <text start="253.169" dur="4.981">to change the rules as to whether or not</text>
  <text start="255.54" dur="4.619">a business is viable in bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="258.15" dur="3.959">proceedings companies will no longer be</text>
  <text start="260.159" dur="3.831">free to decide what do they prefer to</text>
  <text start="262.109" dur="3.93">liquidate the company instead</text>
  <text start="263.99" dur="4.39">corporations will be obliged to accept</text>
  <text start="266.039" dur="4.94">debt restructuring offerings from</text>
  <text start="268.38" dur="4.27">creditors on creditor proposed terms</text>
  <text start="270.979" dur="4.901">centered around</text>
  <text start="272.65" dur="5.79">to equity conversions new rules favor</text>
  <text start="275.88" dur="4.72">foreign financial institutions including</text>
  <text start="278.44" dur="5.64">the vulture funds to take over the</text>
  <text start="280.6" dur="5.099">companies and of course what we see all</text>
  <text start="284.08" dur="3.75">this happening right now because when we</text>
  <text start="285.699" dur="4.19">are in this end game where there is</text>
  <text start="287.83" dur="4.53">absolutely no money left company</text>
  <text start="289.889" dur="5.021">countries are completely imploding on</text>
  <text start="292.36" dur="5.61">themselves they start to raise taxes</text>
  <text start="294.91" dur="5.46">they start to change laws and most most</text>
  <text start="297.97" dur="5.009">of these changes are not to benefit the</text>
  <text start="300.37" dur="5.46">people it&amp;#39;s actually to hurt the people</text>
  <text start="302.979" dur="6">because they&amp;#39;re benefitting the bankers</text>
  <text start="305.83" dur="5.19">and the government officials to keep</text>
  <text start="308.979" dur="4.56">their positions of course and none of</text>
  <text start="311.02" dur="5.01">this flows down to the people and people</text>
  <text start="313.539" dur="4.831">usually end up hurting they usually end</text>
  <text start="316.03" dur="4.32">up on the street they usually can&amp;#39;t feed</text>
  <text start="318.37" dur="4.47">their families they don&amp;#39;t have jobs and</text>
  <text start="320.35" dur="4.77">we are seeing this all across Europe</text>
  <text start="322.84" dur="4.17">this is why unemployment is so high we</text>
  <text start="325.12" dur="3.66">see this in the United States this is</text>
  <text start="327.01" dur="4.17">why the real unemployment numbers are</text>
  <text start="328.78" dur="4.949">not six point seven percent they are</text>
  <text start="331.18" dur="4.14">really closer to thirty or thirty seven</text>
  <text start="333.729" dur="4.281">percent depending on the calculation you</text>
  <text start="335.32" dur="5.34">use and these numbers are continually</text>
  <text start="338.01" dur="5.35">rising they&amp;#39;re not falling they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="340.66" dur="4.02">rising and even though the propaganda</text>
  <text start="343.36" dur="2.61">and the corporate media is continually</text>
  <text start="344.68" dur="3.66">saying that things are getting better</text>
  <text start="345.97" dur="4.979">everything looks great you all we have</text>
  <text start="348.34" dur="4.77">to do is take a look around and we see</text>
  <text start="350.949" dur="5.241">what is really happening we see that</text>
  <text start="353.11" dur="8.1">there are mass number of layoffs we see</text>
  <text start="356.19" dur="7.75">companies going into bankruptcy and even</text>
  <text start="361.21" dur="7.17">from mcdonalds that reported that their</text>
  <text start="363.94" dur="6.84">sales are in a decline they expected a</text>
  <text start="368.38" dur="5.37">decline of point six percent in their</text>
  <text start="370.78" dur="6.27">sales well it&amp;#39;s negative one point four</text>
  <text start="373.75" dur="7.68">percent now let me ask you it&amp;#39;s a dollar</text>
  <text start="377.05" dur="7.589">to buy food on the dollar menu so people</text>
  <text start="381.43" dur="5.64">are having a very tough time making ends</text>
  <text start="384.639" dur="5.011">meet and a very tough time just buying</text>
  <text start="387.07" dur="5.76">the dollar food because the dollar today</text>
  <text start="389.65" dur="5.639">is not really worth that much and people</text>
  <text start="392.83" dur="5.07">are having and struggling just to get</text>
  <text start="395.289" dur="4.141">that dollar to buy that food and food is</text>
  <text start="397.9" dur="3.6">going up in price and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="399.43" dur="4.47">mcdonald&amp;#39;s has been changing their menu</text>
  <text start="401.5" dur="4.5">to the to the dollar the two-dollar the</text>
  <text start="403.9" dur="2.669">five dollar menu and most likely you</text>
  <text start="406" dur="2.849">will probably</text>
  <text start="406.569" dur="4.261">the dollar stuff fall off and then will</text>
  <text start="408.849" dur="4.47">become the two-dollar the five-dollar</text>
  <text start="410.83" dur="5.519">the ten dollar menu because inflation</text>
  <text start="413.319" dur="5.91">continually makes a food prices</text>
  <text start="416.349" dur="4.68">continually rise and and and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="419.229" dur="3.571">going to have to adjust to this and</text>
  <text start="421.029" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re definitely going to see more</text>
  <text start="422.8" dur="4.709">inflation as time goes on I mean I just</text>
  <text start="425.319" dur="4.8">looked at it went to go purchase milk</text>
  <text start="427.509" dur="4.11">the supermarket that sells the milk is</text>
  <text start="430.119" dur="3.45">at four dollars and twenty-five cents</text>
  <text start="431.619" dur="4.53">just a couple weeks ago and I keep a</text>
  <text start="433.569" dur="5.701">graph of this we were in the threes you</text>
  <text start="436.149" dur="4.74">know 385 then it went up to 395 then</text>
  <text start="439.27" dur="4.5">went up to four thousand fifteen cents</text>
  <text start="440.889" dur="4.98">now I see it at 425 already so food is</text>
  <text start="443.77" dur="4.109">definitely going up and of course the</text>
  <text start="445.869" dur="3.63">products are shrinking so this way they</text>
  <text start="447.879" dur="4.83">don&amp;#39;t have to raise prices and you get</text>
  <text start="449.499" dur="4.62">less for the same exact money that</text>
  <text start="452.709" dur="3.42">you&amp;#39;ve been purchasing the same product</text>
  <text start="454.119" dur="3.66">and I have ice cream people have been</text>
  <text start="456.129" dur="5.07">writing in that there&amp;#39;s crackers you get</text>
  <text start="457.779" dur="7.021">less crackers wine I see has been rising</text>
  <text start="461.199" dur="6.96">in price very quickly fresh fruit apples</text>
  <text start="464.8" dur="6.149">going up in price very quickly and again</text>
  <text start="468.159" dur="5.88">we are going to see more retail stores</text>
  <text start="470.949" dur="5.76">close we are going to see more companies</text>
  <text start="474.039" dur="4.68">laying off now right now I&amp;#39;ve said this</text>
  <text start="476.709" dur="5.58">many many times the real estate market</text>
  <text start="478.719" dur="7.23">is imploding yes we&amp;#39;re hitting the highs</text>
  <text start="482.289" dur="5.46">right now but we saw this in 2008 on the</text>
  <text start="485.949" dur="4.62">beginning of 2008 we&amp;#39;re hitting we were</text>
  <text start="487.749" dur="4.35">hitting the highs and now we understand</text>
  <text start="490.569" dur="4.171">that it is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="492.099" dur="3.96">because most of the financial</text>
  <text start="494.74" dur="3.929">institutions that have mortgage</text>
  <text start="496.059" dur="4.92">departments or mortgage companies have</text>
  <text start="498.669" dur="3.99">been closing or laying off thousands</text>
  <text start="500.979" dur="3.99">upon thousands of people because they</text>
  <text start="502.659" dur="4.081">realize there is no one left to take out</text>
  <text start="504.969" dur="4.5">mortgages just not enough people and</text>
  <text start="506.74" dur="4.44">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is bank of</text>
  <text start="509.469" dur="4.11">america is laying off about a hundred</text>
  <text start="511.18" dur="4.769">and fifty six people and this is just in</text>
  <text start="513.579" dur="3.87">North Texas and this is in their</text>
  <text start="515.949" dur="3.45">mortgage department and you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="517.449" dur="4.08">see this spread across the country and</text>
  <text start="519.399" dur="4.351">they&amp;#39;re going to be laying off thousands</text>
  <text start="521.529" dur="4.381">upon thousands of people because there</text>
  <text start="523.75" dur="4.41">are no mortgages being taken out most of</text>
  <text start="525.91" dur="4.169">the houses that are being purchased most</text>
  <text start="528.16" dur="4.229">likely about sixty percent of them are</text>
  <text start="530.079" dur="5.161">being paid in cash from investors and</text>
  <text start="532.389" dur="5.851">hedge funds getting this free easy money</text>
  <text start="535.24" dur="5.01">from the Fed to go ahead and pump up the</text>
  <text start="538.24" dur="2.23">real estate market they are now trying</text>
  <text start="540.25" dur="1.84">to</text>
  <text start="540.47" dur="3.6">leave the real estate market because</text>
  <text start="542.09" dur="3.69">they realize they brought the prices to</text>
  <text start="544.07" dur="4.08">the highest point they possibly can and</text>
  <text start="545.78" dur="3.87">they need to leave the market before it</text>
  <text start="548.15" dur="4.11">starts coming down so they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="549.65" dur="4.62">unload these properties to people who</text>
  <text start="552.26" dur="3.39">want who are looking to buy homes who</text>
  <text start="554.27" dur="4.2">think that the market is going to go up</text>
  <text start="555.65" dur="4.8">or to flippers or speculators who think</text>
  <text start="558.47" dur="4.41">they can flip the home and make a profit</text>
  <text start="560.45" dur="4.74">because they believe this market is</text>
  <text start="562.88" dur="5.28">going higher and higher which it is not</text>
  <text start="565.19" dur="6.63">it is actually going to come straight</text>

  <text start="833.03" dur="6.59">their interest well we have to remember</text>
  <text start="835.85" dur="7.55">of course it is because they are a</text>

  <text start="892.82" dur="5.58">war on both sides they profit after the</text>

  <text start="913.82" dur="5.52">this system implodes on itself they</text>
  <text start="917.18" dur="5.88">can&amp;#39;t be held responsible because they</text>

  <text start="1018.85" dur="4.26">and you know what they are right it is</text>
  <text start="1021.31" dur="3.389">coming crashing down because if we look</text>
  <text start="1023.11" dur="5.9">at all the economic indicators and</text>
  <text start="1024.699" dur="7.26">everything around us it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="1029.01" dur="5.71">from what the corporate media has been</text>
  <text start="1031.959" dur="5.22">telling us that unemployment is low that</text>
  <text start="1034.72" dur="5.489">retail is improving housing is</text>
  <text start="1037.179" dur="5.821">recovering the economy this year is</text>
  <text start="1040.209" dur="5.49">going to grow at three percent of GDP it</text>
  <text start="1043" dur="4.62">is not happening whatsoever and you have</text>
  <text start="1045.699" dur="5.521">to remember that GDP number was</text>
  <text start="1047.62" dur="5.28">recalculated to include global to</text>
  <text start="1051.22" dur="6.54">include our research and development and</text>
  <text start="1052.9" dur="7.47">they went back to 1929 to recalculate it</text>
  <text start="1057.76" dur="5.22">all the way up to today so the GDP</text>
  <text start="1060.37" dur="4.26">number is in the positive range because</text>
  <text start="1062.98" dur="4.98">otherwise it would be in the negative</text>
  <text start="1064.63" dur="5.789">area at this time so we can see what is</text>
  <text start="1067.96" dur="4.44">happening the economy is not doing well</text>
  <text start="1070.419" dur="3.331">and what they thought was going to</text>
  <text start="1072.4" dur="3.67">happen is they were going to start</text>
  <text start="1073.75" dur="4.36">Obamacare which was going to bring in</text>
  <text start="1076.07" dur="3.84">tons of tax money and it was going to</text>
  <text start="1078.11" dur="3.99">save them and it was going to prop up</text>
  <text start="1079.91" dur="4.44">the system it was going to pay for all</text>
  <text start="1082.1" dur="3.63">this debt that they were creating</text>
  <text start="1084.35" dur="3.66">because they were borrowing all this</text>
  <text start="1085.73" dur="4.32">money for all these programs and</text>
  <text start="1088.01" dur="4.17">everything that they cannot cannot be</text>
  <text start="1090.05" dur="3.93">sustained in this and the 17 trillion</text>
  <text start="1092.18" dur="4.17">dollars worth of debt which is getting</text>
  <text start="1093.98" dur="4.02">close to 18 trillion all of this cannot</text>
  <text start="1096.35" dur="4.08">be sustained so they thought oh you know</text>
  <text start="1098" dur="4.89">what Obamacare that is the answer will</text>
  <text start="1100.43" dur="4.08">put a penalty if people don&amp;#39;t take it we</text>
  <text start="1102.89" dur="5.04">still receive the money and we can</text>
  <text start="1104.51" dur="5.88">intertwine taxes within Obamacare and we</text>
  <text start="1107.93" dur="5.04">can bring in about 200 billion dollars a</text>
  <text start="1110.39" dur="5.31">year from people signing up to Obamacare</text>
  <text start="1112.97" dur="4.53">but guess what it didn&amp;#39;t happen they</text>
  <text start="1115.7" dur="4.11">thought the youth of America was going</text>
  <text start="1117.5" dur="4.53">to purchase all this health insurance</text>
  <text start="1119.81" dur="4.65">and it&amp;#39;s falling flat on its face so</text>
  <text start="1122.03" dur="7.5">right now Obama is looking to get</text>
  <text start="1124.46" dur="6.84">mothers to sign up and have their their</text>
  <text start="1129.53" dur="6">their daughters and their sons who are</text>
  <text start="1131.3" dur="6.39">between 19 and and 30 to sign up and</text>
  <text start="1135.53" dur="4.35">again this is not going to work because</text>
  <text start="1137.69" dur="3.9">we have to look at reality most of these</text>
  <text start="1139.88" dur="4.41">people are coming out of college we have</text>
  <text start="1141.59" dur="4.95">huge amount of student loans they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1144.29" dur="5.13">even make the payments on the student</text>
  <text start="1146.54" dur="6.24">loan why because they can&amp;#39;t find jobs in</text>
  <text start="1149.42" dur="5.61">their majors so they are looking all</text>
  <text start="1152.78" dur="4.05">around they can&amp;#39;t find the jobs so</text>
  <text start="1155.03" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re going to work part-time most of</text>
  <text start="1156.83" dur="3.12">these people are living in their parents</text>
  <text start="1158.12" dur="4.14">basement or in their room that they grew</text>
  <text start="1159.95" dur="3.63">up in and they can&amp;#39;t even pay the</text>
  <text start="1162.26" dur="2.79">student loan so the government came</text>
  <text start="1163.58" dur="3.21">along and said listen we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1165.05" dur="4.05">have we have this new modification</text>
  <text start="1166.79" dur="3.87">program will allow you to drop down your</text>
  <text start="1169.1" dur="3.57">payments or not even make payments for</text>
  <text start="1170.66" dur="3.78">the next eight months and we are seeing</text>
  <text start="1172.67" dur="4.14">this happen right now and this is why</text>
  <text start="1174.44" dur="4.05">the youth of America cannot afford</text>
  <text start="1176.81" dur="3.63">health insurance at this time because</text>
  <text start="1178.49" dur="5.3">they can&amp;#39;t find a job to pay for it they</text>
  <text start="1180.44" dur="9.48">can&amp;#39;t even pay for their student loans</text>
  <text start="1183.79" dur="8.44">now again Obamacare was not for the</text>
  <text start="1189.92" dur="6.35">health of America because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1192.23" dur="7.77">seeing right now is that 15.9 percent in</text>
  <text start="1196.27" dur="7.9">2014 and this is the start of 2014 has a</text>
  <text start="1200" dur="5.73">higher percentage of people back in 2008</text>
  <text start="1204.17" dur="3.78">2008 there were fourteen point eight</text>
  <text start="1205.73" dur="3.72">percent that were uninsured right now in</text>
  <text start="1207.95" dur="6.53">2014 there&amp;#39;s fit</text>
  <text start="1209.45" dur="7.89">18.9 % uninsured so Obamacare is</text>
  <text start="1214.48" dur="4.689">completely not working to ensure the</text>
  <text start="1217.34" dur="3.839">people because most of the insurance</text>
  <text start="1219.169" dur="4.23">programs are very expensive they have</text>
  <text start="1221.179" dur="4.321">very high deductibles and if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1223.399" dur="4.441">know the deductible is it is the amount</text>
  <text start="1225.5" dur="4.38">that you have to pay first before the</text>
  <text start="1227.84" dur="5.52">insurance actually kicks in so most of</text>
  <text start="1229.88" dur="5.399">these are 2000 3000 4000 dollars so you</text>
  <text start="1233.36" dur="3.179">might be paying two hundred dollars a</text>
  <text start="1235.279" dur="3.9">month every month to the insurance</text>
  <text start="1236.539" dur="5.88">company and you go to the doctor and you</text>
  <text start="1239.179" dur="5.161">spend 125 or 150 dollars at the doctor&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1242.419" dur="3.781">office that hundred and fifty comes out</text>
  <text start="1244.34" dur="4.589">of your pocket because you do not reach</text>
  <text start="1246.2" dur="4.53">that two-thousand-dollar deductible once</text>
  <text start="1248.929" dur="3.63">you reach that deductible then the</text>
  <text start="1250.73" dur="4.62">insurance will kick in and guess what</text>
  <text start="1252.559" dur="5.25">most people do not reach that deductible</text>
  <text start="1255.35" dur="5.22">unless the only case that you actually</text>
  <text start="1257.809" dur="5.011">reach the deductible is if you&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="1260.57" dur="4.02">very ill and you actually end up</text>
  <text start="1262.82" dur="4.109">reaching that but for the everyday</text>
  <text start="1264.59" dur="4.799">person going to the doctor three four</text>
  <text start="1266.929" dur="4.62">times a year you will never reach that</text>
  <text start="1269.389" dur="6.931">deductible and the insurance companies</text>
  <text start="1271.549" dur="7.141">will not have to lay out a dime now</text>
  <text start="1276.32" dur="3.989">since the insurance companies are not</text>

  <text start="1284.389" dur="5.311">this on many mate reports ago Obamacare</text>
  <text start="1287.96" dur="5.309">the Affordable Care Act has some</text>

  <text start="1335.72" dur="5.429">but they possibly could because what I</text>
  <text start="1338.36" dur="4.89">think actually happened was the</text>
  <text start="1341.149" dur="4.351">president the government</text>
  <text start="1343.25" dur="3.66">they wanted to bring in tax revenue they</text>

  <text start="1346.91" dur="5.85">companies and they said listen how can</text>
  <text start="1349.37" dur="5.4">we ensure everyone in the country and</text>

  <text start="1354.77" dur="4.2">very easy you know they went to their</text>

  <text start="1358.97" dur="3.6">they said listen we&amp;#39;re going to need to</text>
  <text start="1360.56" dur="2.76">raise everyone&amp;#39;s health insurance and</text>
  <text start="1362.57" dur="2.88">we&amp;#39;re going to have to use these</text>
  <text start="1363.32" dur="6.54">deductibles high deductibles because we</text>
  <text start="1365.45" dur="7.02">can&amp;#39;t pay out but by doing this we can</text>
  <text start="1369.86" dur="4.68">ensure everyone because we think the</text>
  <text start="1372.47" dur="4.68">youth will buy insurance which will</text>
  <text start="1374.54" dur="4.98">cover the older population who is much</text>
  <text start="1377.15" dur="6.69">sicker and this will be covered by the</text>
  <text start="1379.52" dur="8.19">insurance which is that costs a lot more</text>
  <text start="1383.84" dur="5.91">money so the use of America will support</text>

  <text start="1409.19" dur="4.65">the deal also and also once or will</text>
  <text start="1411.44" dur="4.58">intertwine some taxes in there so we can</text>

  <text start="1550.7" dur="4.47">in black uniforms masks and body armor</text>
  <text start="1553.1" dur="4.53">some of them were well armed with</text>
  <text start="1555.17" dur="4.74">machine guns and they were taking out</text>
  <text start="1557.63" dur="4.92">these huge crates and loading them onto</text>
  <text start="1559.91" dur="5.46">the plane and the new leaders reported</text>
  <text start="1562.55" dur="4.89">that what has been happening here in</text>
  <text start="1565.37" dur="4.2">Ukraine is that the United States</text>
  <text start="1567.44" dur="3.87">brought in this plane and it&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="1569.57" dur="3.99">most likely the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="1571.31" dur="6.21">loaded up the plane with you with</text>
  <text start="1573.56" dur="5.7">Ukraine&amp;#39;s gold and they took it away so</text>
  <text start="1577.52" dur="4.5">you can see what is happening the</text>
  <text start="1579.26" dur="4.83">central bankers they go in they loot the</text>
  <text start="1582.02" dur="4.56">countries they go after their gold and</text>
  <text start="1584.09" dur="4.86">this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing this all over</text>
  <text start="1586.58" dur="4.89">the world when Germany asked for their</text>
  <text start="1588.95" dur="4.08">gold and they asked for it you know they</text>
  <text start="1591.47" dur="3.33">went to France and they went to United</text>
  <text start="1593.03" dur="3.36">States of course the Fed said no you</text>
  <text start="1594.8" dur="3.66">know we can repay this and what you know</text>
  <text start="1596.39" dur="4.05">like seven years or so maybe in France</text>
  <text start="1598.46" dur="4.08">didn&amp;#39;t have anything to give them so</text>
  <text start="1600.44" dur="4.2">France went in and they invaded Mally</text>
  <text start="1602.54" dur="4.5">because that is like the third largest</text>
  <text start="1604.64" dur="3.83">gold producer in the world and this is</text>
  <text start="1607.04" dur="4.249">why they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="1608.47" dur="4.53">at this time and we can see they went in</text>
  <text start="1611.289" dur="4.111">they took their gold maybe they&amp;#39;ll go to</text>
  <text start="1613" dur="5.039">the school back to Germany but they are</text>
  <text start="1615.4" dur="5.25">looting the country this is what these</text>
  <text start="1618.039" dur="4.38">central bankers do and this is why their</text>
  <text start="1620.65" dur="5.97">reports out there that the United States</text>
  <text start="1622.419" dur="8.521">has absolutely no gold whatsoever now</text>
  <text start="1626.62" dur="6.539">London and Japan have said that they are</text>
  <text start="1630.94" dur="5.09">not going to impose sanctions against</text>
  <text start="1633.159" dur="6.541">Russia again it is not a smart move and</text>
  <text start="1636.03" dur="6.91">I sanctions against Russia it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="1639.7" dur="5.219">small country like Syria or Iran where</text>
  <text start="1642.94" dur="4.95">you can put sanctions on them Russia</text>
  <text start="1644.919" dur="5.13">they produce a lot of natural gas they</text>
  <text start="1647.89" dur="4.58">produce a lot of oil they have a lot of</text>
  <text start="1650.049" dur="5.641">manufacturing it is a strong economy</text>
  <text start="1652.47" dur="5.199">they&amp;#39;re teamed up with China they have</text>
  <text start="1655.69" dur="5.79">many other countries backing them and</text>
  <text start="1657.669" dur="6">again this is not going to benefit the</text>
  <text start="1661.48" dur="4.14">United States and the private western</text>
  <text start="1663.669" dur="4.681">central bank countries at all if</text>
  <text start="1665.62" dur="4.38">sanctions are imposed on Russia and</text>
  <text start="1668.35" dur="3.3">we&amp;#39;re going to get a little bit into</text>
  <text start="1670" dur="5.669">that a little bit later but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1671.65" dur="7.019">seeing right now is that in Ukraine all</text>
  <text start="1675.669" dur="6.781">these cities and all these military</text>

  <text start="1711.76" dur="5.07">are taking over the bases again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1714.28" dur="5.49">building up the propaganda to make you</text>
  <text start="1716.83" dur="7.29">think that Russia is moving in starting</text>
  <text start="1719.77" dur="7.2">something there now India is backing</text>
  <text start="1724.12" dur="6.12">Russia&amp;#39;s legitimate interest in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1726.97" dur="5.97">along with China so there are more and</text>
  <text start="1730.24" dur="4.59">more countries now moving forward and</text>
  <text start="1732.94" dur="4.38">saying we&amp;#39;re on Russia side now you can</text>
  <text start="1734.83" dur="6">see what&amp;#39;s happening countries are now</text>
  <text start="1737.32" dur="4.42">taking sides of what is going on here in</text>
  <text start="1740.83" dur="4">Ukraine</text>

  <text start="1917.509" dur="4.591">of drills and we can see this is all</text>
  <text start="1919.85" dur="5.52">starting to form now we have to remember</text>
  <text start="1922.1" dur="7.02">that this entire incident was created by</text>
  <text start="1925.37" dur="5.789">a coup by the United States and the EU</text>
  <text start="1929.12" dur="6.33">they spend five billion dollars to do</text>
  <text start="1931.159" dur="6.961">this and again who was in there doing</text>
  <text start="1935.45" dur="4.89">this and right now there&amp;#39;s reports that</text>
  <text start="1938.12" dur="3.75">blackwater and I know they go by many</text>
  <text start="1940.34" dur="4.02">different names but I like calling them</text>

  <text start="1957.86" dur="4.409">destabilize governments to create</text>
  <text start="1960.2" dur="4.829">different incidents like in Boston the</text>
  <text start="1962.269" dur="4.351">Boston bombing they were up there and if</text>
  <text start="1965.029" dur="3.98">if you look at a lot of the pictures a</text>
  <text start="1966.62" dur="5.039">lot of the evidence points to them</text>
  <text start="1969.009" dur="4.991">planting the bombs and doing that but</text>
  <text start="1971.659" dur="5.52">that&amp;#39;s a whole separate side story here</text>
  <text start="1974" dur="5.22">and they&amp;#39;ve also seen Germany Poland and</text>
  <text start="1977.179" dur="5.421">Turkey as well as English speakers that</text>
  <text start="1979.22" dur="5.88">were inside Ukraine during the same time</text>
  <text start="1982.6" dur="5.829">rallying the people get them getting</text>
  <text start="1985.1" dur="5.939">them going and there is all different</text>
  <text start="1988.429" dur="6.45">type of information now coming out we</text>
  <text start="1991.039" dur="5.941">also have the FBI the Department of</text>

  <text start="1996.98" dur="8.73">in Ukraine at this time again what are</text>
  <text start="2002.32" dur="9.109">they doing there they are there for one</text>
  <text start="2005.71" dur="9.48">specific reason to make sure Ukraine is</text>
  <text start="2011.429" dur="6.401">on the EU system it joins up with NATO</text>
  <text start="2015.19" dur="5.28">and they want Crimea they want the</text>
  <text start="2017.83" dur="5.25">southern and the eastern parts and the</text>
  <text start="2020.47" dur="4.649">central bankers need to have this all</text>
  <text start="2023.08" dur="5.069">because they need to prop up the system</text>
  <text start="2025.119" dur="5.91">again we have to remember they do not</text>
  <text start="2028.149" dur="5.91">want to be blamed for this collapse and</text>
  <text start="2031.029" dur="5.461">they need to get an event then a war</text>
  <text start="2034.059" dur="4.411">started before this happens because you</text>
  <text start="2036.49" dur="3.84">have to remember the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="2038.47" dur="3.36">in control of the money all across the</text>
  <text start="2040.33" dur="5.37">private western central bank countries</text>
  <text start="2041.83" dur="6.539">if the system collapses today they would</text>
  <text start="2045.7" dur="5.1">be blamed for what is happening and they</text>
  <text start="2048.369" dur="5.941">do not want to be blamed because after</text>
  <text start="2050.8" dur="5.76">this great war they believe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2054.31" dur="5.519">going to reset the system and start it</text>
  <text start="2056.56" dur="5.339">all over again again after war countries</text>
  <text start="2059.829" dur="4.411">have to rebuild they need to borrow</text>
  <text start="2061.899" dur="4.92">money and they&amp;#39;re going to go to these</text>
  <text start="2064.24" dur="5.55">central bankers as always to get this</text>
  <text start="2066.819" dur="5.911">money unless the country stands up and</text>
  <text start="2069.79" dur="5.069">says no more central bankers the country</text>
  <text start="2072.73" dur="4.349">will take care of itself and print its</text>
  <text start="2074.859" dur="4.621">own money which is again in the United</text>
  <text start="2077.079" dur="5.34">States it&amp;#39;s in the Constitution that we</text>
  <text start="2079.48" dur="4.109">can coin our own money we don&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="2082.419" dur="4.67">Federal Reserve because the Federal</text>
  <text start="2083.589" dur="6.33">Reserve is a separate corporation and</text>
  <text start="2087.089" dur="4.451">again this is this is what what is</text>
  <text start="2089.919" dur="4.98">happening and this is what they believe</text>
  <text start="2091.54" dur="7.02">now if we go to Libya right now we see</text>
  <text start="2094.899" dur="6.541">that North that North Korea tanker was</text>
  <text start="2098.56" dur="5.34">filling up oil from the Libya Libyan</text>
  <text start="2101.44" dur="3.48">militia which is not part of the Libyan</text>
  <text start="2103.9" dur="2.07">government it&amp;#39;s the people who are</text>
  <text start="2104.92" dur="2.97">taking over the country and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2105.97" dur="4.98">taken almost all of the country back and</text>
  <text start="2107.89" dur="5.34">now the Libyan government is staying in</text>
  <text start="2110.95" dur="3.659">a five-star hotel because they raided</text>
  <text start="2113.23" dur="3.45">the Parliament building and they kicked</text>
  <text start="2114.609" dur="4.111">them out and again once this Libyan</text>
  <text start="2116.68" dur="4.26">militia completely takes over the</text>
  <text start="2118.72" dur="4.649">country and they have full control this</text>
  <text start="2120.94" dur="3.96">is when the United States is the central</text>
  <text start="2123.369" dur="3.601">bankers are going to start to worry and</text>
  <text start="2124.9" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re already worrying right now the</text>
  <text start="2126.97" dur="3.72">United States has threatened Libyan</text>
  <text start="2128.41" dur="4.11">militias with sanctions for attempts to</text>
  <text start="2130.69" dur="3.57">illegally sell the oil that belongs to</text>
  <text start="2132.52" dur="3.99">the libyan national oil corporation and</text>
  <text start="2134.26" dur="4.079">its partners including US companies and</text>
  <text start="2136.51" dur="4.48">we understand that the United States has</text>
  <text start="2138.339" dur="4.481">been sending military officers</text>
  <text start="2140.99" dur="5.85">trainers down to Libya to train the</text>
  <text start="2142.82" dur="5.49">5,000 to 8,000 Libyan soldiers and now</text>
  <text start="2146.84" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="2148.31" dur="3.51">placing sanctions on the Libyan militia</text>
  <text start="2150.14" dur="4.35">they don&amp;#39;t care about the sanctions</text>
  <text start="2151.82" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;ll sell the oil using gold using</text>
  <text start="2154.49" dur="4.74">the yuan using any other currency</text>
  <text start="2156.89" dur="4.5">besides the US dollar and this is when</text>
  <text start="2159.23" dur="5.16">things are going to go hot there and</text>
  <text start="2161.39" dur="6.15">again if we look at this and we look at</text>
  <text start="2164.39" dur="6.36">the entire thing what is going to happen</text>
  <text start="2167.54" dur="5.37">and this is just one scenario we have to</text>
  <text start="2170.75" dur="4.08">remember the United States is looking to</text>
  <text start="2172.91" dur="3.42">put sanctions on Russia and of course we</text>
  <text start="2174.83" dur="3.15">know this is not going to work out</text>
  <text start="2176.33" dur="3.78">because Russia has a lot of</text>
  <text start="2177.98" dur="5.13">manufacturing Russia supplies a lot of</text>
  <text start="2180.11" dur="7.11">oil and natural gas to Europe Russia has</text>
  <text start="2183.11" dur="9.259">a very tight strong economy at this time</text>
  <text start="2187.22" dur="8.79">and again we have to look at this russia</text>
  <text start="2192.369" dur="6.581">holds a lot a debt of the united states</text>
  <text start="2196.01" dur="5.55">so does china and if they impose</text>
  <text start="2198.95" dur="5.07">sanctions putin already said that he</text>
  <text start="2201.56" dur="5.61">will return and start dumping the</text>
  <text start="2204.02" dur="6.99">Treasuries they cannot allow this to</text>
  <text start="2207.17" dur="7.199">happen because if this happens the other</text>
  <text start="2211.01" dur="5.76">countries will start doing the same and</text>
  <text start="2214.369" dur="6.211">this means the Fed would have to</text>
  <text start="2216.77" dur="6.24">increase quantitative easing to pay for</text>
  <text start="2220.58" dur="4.83">those Treasuries that are being dumped</text>
  <text start="2223.01" dur="4.49">and again instead of tapering we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2225.41" dur="4.709">going to see an increase of a</text>
  <text start="2227.5" dur="6.91">quantitative easing now on the other</text>
  <text start="2230.119" dur="8.581">hand if the US imposes sanctions on</text>
  <text start="2234.41" dur="7.23">Russia and says you know you&amp;#39;ll be fines</text>
  <text start="2238.7" dur="5.73">or penalties Russia might come out and</text>
  <text start="2241.64" dur="5.7">say listen that&amp;#39;s fine don&amp;#39;t use the US</text>
  <text start="2244.43" dur="7.55">dollar to pay everyone in the world can</text>
  <text start="2247.34" dur="7.8">use the u1 or Russia&amp;#39;s currency or gold</text>
  <text start="2251.98" dur="5.139">they don&amp;#39;t have to use the US dollar and</text>
  <text start="2255.14" dur="3.51">if they start doing that other countries</text>
  <text start="2257.119" dur="3.75">are going to go we&amp;#39;ll wait a minute if</text>
  <text start="2258.65" dur="3.48">we don&amp;#39;t need to do this we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="2260.869" dur="4.051">to keep all these dollars in reserve</text>
  <text start="2262.13" dur="5.4">let&amp;#39;s start returning it back to the US</text>
  <text start="2264.92" dur="4.89">because we do not need this money then</text>
  <text start="2267.53" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;ll be returned to the US more money</text>
  <text start="2269.81" dur="4.59">would flood into the market of the US</text>
  <text start="2272" dur="2.88">and what will happen is the value of the</text>
  <text start="2274.4" dur="2.85">dollar</text>
  <text start="2274.88" dur="4.709">go down and it will take more dollars to</text>
  <text start="2277.25" dur="7.95">buy the same products instead of 4,000</text>
  <text start="2279.589" dur="9.75">25-cent milk we will now see $8 milk $9</text>
  <text start="2285.2" dur="7.5">milk $10 milk fuel instead of</text>
  <text start="2289.339" dur="6.03">four-dollar four-dollar gallon it will</text>
  <text start="2292.7" dur="6.359">be eight nine fifteen dollars again</text>
  <text start="2295.369" dur="7.41">things will start getting very expensive</text>
  <text start="2299.059" dur="6.54">because the dollar will be resetting to</text>
  <text start="2302.779" dur="8.161">what is happening around the globe and</text>
  <text start="2305.599" dur="6.96">again the central bankers will not allow</text>
  <text start="2310.94" dur="5.329">this to happen to what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="2312.559" dur="6.74">do is they&amp;#39;re going to spark ignite</text>
  <text start="2316.269" dur="6.76">something that will create an event</text>
  <text start="2319.299" dur="6.131">which will allow them to go to war now</text>
  <text start="2323.029" dur="5.941">if we look out and we see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2325.43" dur="5.49">happening in Ukraine and in Libya and in</text>
  <text start="2328.97" dur="4.74">Syria I mean these are all the hot zones</text>
  <text start="2330.92" dur="4.23">right now even Venezuela hot zones where</text>
  <text start="2333.71" dur="3.27">something can happen but we&amp;#39;ll just look</text>
  <text start="2335.15" dur="4.74">at the Ukraine at this point we have</text>
  <text start="2336.98" dur="7.44">three US ships in the Black Sea at the</text>
  <text start="2339.89" dur="7.35">time what could happen is there could be</text>
  <text start="2344.42" dur="7.109">some type of incident there where a ship</text>
  <text start="2347.24" dur="6.51">is hit with a torpedo or a missile or</text>
  <text start="2351.529" dur="6.27">something and they can blame it on</text>
  <text start="2353.75" dur="7.859">Russia and all of a sudden boom this</text>
  <text start="2357.799" dur="6.75">sparked something or the US military has</text>
  <text start="2361.609" dur="4.861">been training with backpack nukes they</text>
  <text start="2364.549" dur="4.02">can sneak a backpack nuke into the</text>
  <text start="2366.47" dur="5.549">country using one of the private</text>
  <text start="2368.569" dur="5.73">mercenary groups set it off and set in</text>
  <text start="2372.019" dur="4.56">Kiev or around that area and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2374.299" dur="5.701">small nuke and they could blame that on</text>
  <text start="2376.579" dur="6.24">Russia just to get it all started</text>
  <text start="2380" dur="4.559">because we have to remember the central</text>
  <text start="2382.819" dur="3.75">bankers United States government will</text>
  <text start="2384.559" dur="4.681">not make the first move it has to be</text>
  <text start="2386.569" dur="4.8">seen that Russia is doing something</text>
  <text start="2389.24" dur="4.529">making the first move making the first</text>
  <text start="2391.369" dur="5.551">attack because once they attack it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2393.769" dur="4.8">open season and more start now will this</text>
  <text start="2396.92" dur="4.619">be enough to get the American people</text>
  <text start="2398.569" dur="5.311">moved enough to start war I I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2401.539" dur="5.101">think so I don&amp;#39;t think so because the</text>
  <text start="2403.88" dur="4.5">polls right now are very low they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2406.64" dur="2.13">even there&amp;#39;s only fourteen percent that</text>
  <text start="2408.38" dur="2.61">believe</text>
  <text start="2408.77" dur="3.99">I even be in Ukraine and fourteen</text>
  <text start="2410.99" dur="6.23">percent that believe that we should go</text>
  <text start="2412.76" dur="6.78">to war with Ukraine the other eighty</text>
  <text start="2417.22" dur="4.39">eighty six percent believe that we</text>
  <text start="2419.54" dur="3.99">shouldn&amp;#39;t even be in Ukraine we should</text>
  <text start="2421.61" dur="4.86">have nothing to do with it and this is</text>
  <text start="2423.53" dur="5.1">the same type of bowl the poll metrics</text>
  <text start="2426.47" dur="4.44">that we saw in Syria and this is why</text>
  <text start="2428.63" dur="5.79">they couldn&amp;#39;t pull it off so to get the</text>
  <text start="2430.91" dur="6.09">American people really going and really</text>
  <text start="2434.42" dur="3.6">ready for war and begging for war they</text>
  <text start="2437" dur="3.39">are definitely going to have to do</text>
  <text start="2438.02" dur="5.76">something here in the States and when I</text>
  <text start="2440.39" dur="5.1">mean do something I mean a cyber attack</text>
  <text start="2443.78" dur="3.33">on a financial system because they</text>
  <text start="2445.49" dur="3.75">understand that the system is imploding</text>
  <text start="2447.11" dur="4.38">they know they can&amp;#39;t keep it going for</text>
  <text start="2449.24" dur="3.69">much longer and it&amp;#39;ll be a lot easier to</text>
  <text start="2451.49" dur="5.73">blame it on Russia at this point or</text>
  <text start="2452.93" dur="5.73">Syria or Iran or China but right now it</text>
  <text start="2457.22" dur="2.85">looks like Russia I mean it keeps</text>
  <text start="2458.66" dur="3.3">changing depending on how they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="2460.07" dur="3.45">to work this but at all it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2461.96" dur="3.15">really matter because it all leads to</text>
  <text start="2463.52" dur="3.75">China and Russia anyhow if they play</text>
  <text start="2465.11" dur="4.47">mitt on Syria Russia and trying to back</text>
  <text start="2467.27" dur="3.99">Syria if they blame it on Iran Syria</text>
  <text start="2469.58" dur="3.81">backs Iran and they have Russia and</text>
  <text start="2471.26" dur="4.5">China backing them if they blame it on</text>
  <text start="2473.39" dur="4.68">China or Russia we&amp;#39;re at war with Russia</text>
  <text start="2475.76" dur="6.39">and China so it all fits into the same</text>
  <text start="2478.07" dur="6.36">exact model here and again they will not</text>
  <text start="2482.15" dur="4.65">allow this to happen they will not allow</text>
  <text start="2484.43" dur="3.78">the economy to collapse before they can</text>
  <text start="2486.8" dur="3.96">get something started because they do</text>
  <text start="2488.21" dur="4.47">not want all eyes on the central bankers</text>
  <text start="2490.76" dur="4.62">because remember the central makers</text>
  <text start="2492.68" dur="4.67">control all the private western central</text>
  <text start="2495.38" dur="4.68">countries they&amp;#39;ve been telling us for</text>

  <text start="2521.24" dur="5.37">make sense and we can see with our own</text>
  <text start="2523.55" dur="4.74">eyes we can feel it that this economy is</text>
  <text start="2526.61" dur="3.81">not doing well because when we get the</text>

  <text start="2567.44" dur="9.299">this is why I&amp;#39;m saying that Libya</text>
  <text start="2571.359" dur="9.331">Ukraine could trigger a dollar reset</text>
  <text start="2576.739" dur="8.52">because if these sanctions go forward</text>
