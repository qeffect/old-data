  <text start="78.31" dur="6.27">that this new deal they&amp;#39;re coming up</text>
  <text start="81.85" dur="5.969">with for the bailout it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="84.58" dur="7.379">fantastic because it will end austerity</text>
  <text start="87.819" dur="6.931">we will not use austerity anymore well</text>
  <text start="91.959" dur="4.921">then he campaign on this was in his</text>
  <text start="94.75" dur="5.819">whole campaign about not going along</text>
  <text start="96.88" dur="6.599">with the central bank not implementing</text>

  <text start="127.629" dur="5.39">think this new loan is going to last</text>
  <text start="133.08" dur="7.45">it&amp;#39;s not going to last that long until</text>
  <text start="135.7" dur="7.77">they need more like in 2018 and when</text>
  <text start="140.53" dur="5.789">that time comes up as we saw going all</text>
  <text start="143.47" dur="6.15">the way back to 2009 up to this point</text>
  <text start="146.319" dur="7.051">they need more and more and more it will</text>
  <text start="149.62" dur="6.899">never end and they will have to</text>
  <text start="153.37" dur="6.03">implement austerity unless the whole</text>
  <text start="156.519" dur="5.521">system comes collapsing down then that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="159.4" dur="4.5">a whole nother problem we see here in</text>
  <text start="162.04" dur="5.43">the United States the consumer</text>
  <text start="163.9" dur="5.669">confidence well it is fallen for the</text>
  <text start="167.47" dur="4.34">first time since the November elections</text>
  <text start="169.569" dur="4.351">because what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="171.81" dur="4.45">people are starting to realize this</text>
  <text start="173.92" dur="4.02">something wrong with the economy stock</text>
  <text start="176.26" dur="2.6">market continually moves up and up and</text>
  <text start="177.94" dur="2.81">up</text>
  <text start="178.86" dur="4.47">and if this doesn&amp;#39;t look like a bubble</text>
  <text start="180.75" dur="4.8">then I don&amp;#39;t know what else looks like a</text>
  <text start="183.33" dur="3.87">bubble because all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="185.55" dur="4.74">market takes off and it&amp;#39;s a straight</text>
  <text start="187.2" dur="6.66">line up I mean again all indicators</text>
  <text start="190.29" dur="6.36">point to a huge bubble and we can see</text>
  <text start="193.86" dur="4.92">that retail it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="196.65" dur="3.57">we talked about hhgregg and how they</text>
  <text start="198.78" dur="3.84">might be closing some stores and right</text>
  <text start="200.22" dur="5.61">now we find out they had 14 straight</text>
  <text start="202.62" dur="7.37">quarters of declining sales and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="205.83" dur="8.22">looking to declare bankruptcy and again</text>
  <text start="209.99" dur="5.62">retail is contracting big time and so is</text>
  <text start="214.05" dur="3.63">home sales we talk about homes quite a</text>
  <text start="215.61" dur="4.05">bit because once the real estate market</text>
  <text start="217.68" dur="3.89">goes down guess what that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="219.66" dur="5.31">take everything else down with it and</text>
  <text start="221.57" dur="5.919">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that new</text>
  <text start="224.97" dur="4.89">home sales well they completely</text>
  <text start="227.489" dur="3.901">disappoint the census reported the</text>
  <text start="229.86" dur="4.95">latest disappoint when it comes to new</text>
  <text start="231.39" dur="7.11">home sales missing an expectation of 571</text>
  <text start="234.81" dur="6.96">thousand and up from a three point seven</text>
  <text start="238.5" dur="6.72">percent from a downward revised 535,000</text>
  <text start="241.77" dur="5.82">in December and the data for all three</text>
  <text start="245.22" dur="4.53">prior months will guess what they will</text>
  <text start="247.59" dur="6.6">revise lower to try to push this month</text>
  <text start="249.75" dur="8.7">up but more troubling than all of that</text>
  <text start="254.19" dur="7.59">is that one decade after the last</text>
  <text start="258.45" dur="7.35">housing peak new home sales are well</text>
  <text start="261.78" dur="7.32">below half their peak hit in 2005 and</text>
  <text start="265.8" dur="5.55">when you look at this we see housing has</text>
  <text start="269.1" dur="5.85">really gone nowhere it&amp;#39;s like flatlined</text>
  <text start="271.35" dur="7.379">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="274.95" dur="7.02">mortgage applications are declining new</text>
  <text start="278.729" dur="6.271">home sales are declining and existing</text>
  <text start="281.97" dur="7.19">home sales are going absolutely nowhere</text>
  <text start="285" dur="7.919">and we see out in New York City that</text>
  <text start="289.16" dur="8.23">there is a major problem in the high-end</text>
  <text start="292.919" dur="6.661">condo market not all is well in the</text>
  <text start="297.39" dur="5.67">luxury segment in the US House market</text>
  <text start="299.58" dur="7.47">and what we see is the Manhattans luxury</text>
  <text start="303.06" dur="6.84">condo segment well as we reported many</text>
  <text start="307.05" dur="4.6">reports ago there&amp;#39;s been a sharp</text>
  <text start="309.9" dur="4.66">deterioration</text>
  <text start="311.65" dur="4.859">in that market and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="314.56" dur="4.5">right now this is coming from Barry</text>
  <text start="316.509" dur="5.821">Sternlicht CEO of starwood property</text>
  <text start="319.06" dur="5.1">trust and just as a reminder starwood</text>
  <text start="322.33" dur="4.11">property trust isn&amp;#39;t a traditional</text>
  <text start="324.16" dur="4.05">mortgage right plowing its capital into</text>
  <text start="326.44" dur="4.65">mortgage-backed securities but instead</text>
  <text start="328.21" dur="5.16">its primary business is the direct</text>
  <text start="331.09" dur="5.37">financing of a real estate project and</text>
  <text start="333.37" dur="5.73">as such it is for more familiar with the</text>
  <text start="336.46" dur="7.14">nuances of a given real estate market</text>
  <text start="339.1" dur="7.099">than those who transact in bulk so it is</text>
  <text start="343.6" dur="7.97">what sterling said during yesterday&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="346.199" dur="8.731">starwood conference he said that the</text>
  <text start="351.57" dur="6.909">market right now is at all-time highs</text>
  <text start="354.93" dur="6.64">that optimism is now very far removed</text>
  <text start="358.479" dur="6.211">from the one sector that I traditionally</text>
  <text start="361.57" dur="5.94">benefited the most from soaring S&amp;amp;P 500</text>
  <text start="364.69" dur="6.09">Manhattan luxury real estate and he went</text>
  <text start="367.51" dur="6.86">on to say New York City rental market is</text>
  <text start="370.78" dur="7.29">going to be weak he said it it is weak</text>
  <text start="374.37" dur="6.22">it&amp;#39;s going to continue to be weak Miami</text>
  <text start="378.07" dur="5.46">has a similar situation with a lot of</text>
  <text start="380.59" dur="4.62">condos coming online with much a</text>
  <text start="383.53" dur="5.069">different structure than any market we</text>
  <text start="385.21" dur="8.579">have seen before the condo market at the</text>
  <text start="388.599" dur="10.521">high end is a catastrophe and will get</text>
  <text start="393.789" dur="9.41">worse it shows us the housing market</text>
  <text start="399.12" dur="9.82">right now it&amp;#39;s starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="403.199" dur="7.991">it&amp;#39;s starting to implode and we can see</text>
  <text start="408.94" dur="5.759">that the real estate market was</text>
  <text start="411.19" dur="8.19">completely pumped up into these gigantic</text>
  <text start="414.699" dur="9.331">bubbles in 22 different cities and there</text>
  <text start="419.38" dur="6.27">was a report that was released from the</text>
  <text start="424.03" dur="4.35">US Treasury Department Financial Crimes</text>
  <text start="425.65" dur="6.389">enforcement Network network since then</text>
  <text start="428.38" dur="6.719">and it announced that it&amp;#39;s going to</text>

  <text start="460.68" dur="3.97">industry professionals played along</text>
  <text start="462.85" dur="3.72">there were no reporting requirements</text>
  <text start="464.65" dur="3.9">whatsoever everyone in the world knew it</text>
  <text start="466.57" dur="4.77">and they came to launder their cash by</text>
  <text start="468.55" dur="7.17">buying expensive homes very interesting</text>
  <text start="471.34" dur="7.98">and what they come to find out is that</text>
  <text start="475.72" dur="7.5">they were just buying all of these homes</text>

  <text start="496.479" dur="5.641">interesting which cities this was</text>
  <text start="499.72" dur="8.9">happening in where homes were being</text>
  <text start="502.12" dur="11.24">purchased new york manhattan area Miami</text>

  <text start="523.45" dur="7.59">cities which are included in the</text>
  <text start="527.32" dur="5.7">case-shiller survey of the 22 cities so</text>
  <text start="531.04" dur="4.94">if we step back and take a look at all</text>
  <text start="533.02" dur="5.16">of this what do we see well we know that</text>
  <text start="535.98" dur="4.93">investment companies hedge funds they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="538.18" dur="5.39">been purchasing thousands and thousands</text>
  <text start="540.91" dur="6.15">of homes now they&amp;#39;re offloading them to</text>
  <text start="543.57" dur="5.08">smaller investors we see that there were</text>
  <text start="547.06" dur="5.04">foreigners and other investment</text>
  <text start="548.65" dur="8.189">companies laundering money in these same</text>
  <text start="552.1" dur="7.71">areas pumping up the bubble now a couple</text>
  <text start="556.839" dur="6.12">weeks ago we talked about the gasoline</text>
  <text start="559.81" dur="6.21">demand declining well it is declined</text>
  <text start="562.959" dur="6.081">even further and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="566.02" dur="6.8">now is that this is an indicator that</text>
  <text start="569.04" dur="7.45">the United States is in a recession and</text>
  <text start="572.82" dur="5.7">this shows us that things are not going</text>
  <text start="576.49" dur="3.88">well whatsoever and they</text>
  <text start="578.52" dur="4.8">our other troubling indicators because</text>
  <text start="580.37" dur="5.26">Bloomberg points out their recent pace</text>
  <text start="583.32" dur="6.66">of recovery in u.s. miles driven is</text>
  <text start="585.63" dur="6.27">slowly slowing sharply vehicle miles</text>
  <text start="589.98" dur="4.71">traveled increased by just point five</text>
  <text start="591.9" dur="4.23">percent year-over-year in December for</text>
  <text start="594.69" dur="3.12">much of the prior two years roughly</text>
  <text start="596.13" dur="3.81">coinciding with the crash in oil prices</text>
  <text start="597.81" dur="5.07">growth had averaged more than three</text>
  <text start="599.94" dur="7.2">percent sometimes spiking to five</text>
  <text start="602.88" dur="6.45">percent so people are driving less and</text>
  <text start="607.14" dur="4.35">less maybe because they don&amp;#39;t have to go</text>
  <text start="609.33" dur="6.98">to work maybe because they can&amp;#39;t find a</text>
  <text start="611.49" dur="7.41">job and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="616.31" dur="4.24">things are rapidly falling apart and we</text>
  <text start="618.9" dur="4.32">have to remember something very</text>
  <text start="620.55" dur="6.48">important the stock market is</text>
  <text start="623.22" dur="6.84">continually moving up on the idea that</text>
  <text start="627.03" dur="6.03">Trump is going to come out with all</text>
  <text start="630.06" dur="5.7">these different reforms and as we talked</text>
  <text start="633.06" dur="4.56">about yesterday well we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="635.76" dur="3.93">see these reforms till maybe later this</text>
  <text start="637.62" dur="6.42">year or maybe next year or the year</text>
  <text start="639.69" dur="7.44">after that once individuals start</text>
  <text start="644.04" dur="4.74">getting wind of this guess what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="647.13" dur="5.49">to happen to the market because this is</text>
  <text start="648.78" dur="6.66">all based on hope the idea that things</text>
  <text start="652.62" dur="4.17">are coming down the pike here so things</text>
  <text start="655.44" dur="4.95">are going to turn around dramatically</text>
  <text start="656.79" dur="5.64">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that they</text>
  <text start="660.39" dur="4.26">keep saying that oh the stock market it</text>
  <text start="662.43" dur="5.49">maybe it&amp;#39;s overvalued maybe it isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="664.65" dur="5.91">overvalued well guess what it is</text>
  <text start="667.92" dur="4.23">overvalued and here&amp;#39;s why and this is</text>
  <text start="670.56" dur="3.78">coming from sovereign man Simon black</text>
  <text start="672.15" dur="4.95">when we look at the stock market right</text>
  <text start="674.34" dur="4.92">now and we look back through more than a</text>
