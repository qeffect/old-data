  <text start="57.18" dur="6.15">this is episode 1607 Bien today&amp;#39;s date</text>
  <text start="60.54" dur="6.09">is July 3rd 2018 and thus out of the</text>
  <text start="63.33" dur="6.63">episode is we have the server tracking</text>
  <text start="66.63" dur="5.07">it all cornered let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="69.96" dur="4.049">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="71.7" dur="5.49">geopolitical news now as we know</text>
  <text start="74.009" dur="5.851">Facebook they are under scrutiny from</text>
  <text start="77.19" dur="4.92">the federal government and the federal</text>
  <text start="79.86" dur="3.6">government is ramping up its scrutiny of</text>
  <text start="82.11" dur="4.95">Facebook&amp;#39;s role in the Cambridge</text>
  <text start="83.46" dur="6.84">analytical data privacy scandal because</text>
  <text start="87.06" dur="5.85">we now have another federal agency that</text>
  <text start="90.3" dur="4.89">is looking into Facebook and that is the</text>
  <text start="92.91" dur="4.89">Securities and Exchange Commission they</text>
  <text start="95.19" dur="4.11">have joined the Federal Trade Commission</text>
  <text start="97.8" dur="4.41">the FBI the Department of Justice in</text>
  <text start="99.3" dur="5.73">their investigation of the tech giant</text>
  <text start="102.21" dur="5.39">now the involvement of so many agencies</text>
  <text start="105.03" dur="5.61">confirms that the investigation is</text>
  <text start="107.6" dur="5.439">broadening in scope now the FTC</text>
  <text start="110.64" dur="3.68">disclosed in March that it had launched</text>
  <text start="113.039" dur="5.911">an investigation into whether Facebook</text>
  <text start="114.32" dur="7.18">had violated a consent decree over its</text>
  <text start="118.95" dur="4.08">handling of personal data a violation</text>
  <text start="121.5" dur="5.04">that could potentially lead to more than</text>
  <text start="123.03" dur="5.07">1 trillion in fines and when we look at</text>
  <text start="126.54" dur="3.469">Mark Zuckerberg in his Facebook</text>
  <text start="128.1" dur="5.729">transactions where he was dumping stock</text>
  <text start="130.009" dur="6.341">when you see why the SEC might be</text>
  <text start="133.829" dur="4.681">involved with this because they might be</text>
  <text start="136.35" dur="3.9">looking at that because they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="138.51" dur="4.41">at the timing of when he was actually</text>
  <text start="140.25" dur="5.329">dropping the stock dumping the stop</text>
  <text start="142.92" dur="6.629">stock I should say because he knew that</text>
  <text start="145.579" dur="7.151">Facebook was going to be looked at and</text>
  <text start="149.549" dur="5.461">he got a heads-up and he started to dump</text>
  <text start="152.73" dur="5.009">a lot of his stock because he knew that</text>
  <text start="155.01" dur="4.77">the stock was going to go down so we see</text>
  <text start="157.739" dur="4.861">right now that Facebook is in big</text>
  <text start="159.78" dur="6.09">trouble and it&amp;#39;s just not getting better</text>
  <text start="162.6" dur="6.15">it is getting worse for Facebook and we</text>
  <text start="165.87" dur="6.3">need to remember that q did mention that</text>
  <text start="168.75" dur="5.48">Facebook and many of the other social</text>
  <text start="172.17" dur="5.46">media companies were going to be</text>
  <text start="174.23" dur="5.5">involved in a scenario just like this</text>
  <text start="177.63" dur="4.8">and Facebook seems to be one of the</text>
  <text start="179.73" dur="3.7">first that is having this huge huge</text>
  <text start="182.43" dur="4.389">problem here</text>
  <text start="183.43" dur="6.18">we see Peter struck well he was going to</text>
  <text start="186.819" dur="4.95">give test testimony in front of Congress</text>
  <text start="189.61" dur="5.43">and it was going to be publicized and</text>
  <text start="191.769" dur="4.771">now Peter struck has changed his mind he</text>
  <text start="195.04" dur="4.589">doesn&amp;#39;t want to do this right now</text>
  <text start="196.54" dur="5.97">his attorney is saying that this is a</text>
  <text start="199.629" dur="6.091">trap and he should not be publicly</text>
  <text start="202.51" dur="6.539">testifying in front of Congress and he</text>
  <text start="205.72" dur="6.15">is declining to do so at this point we</text>
  <text start="209.049" dur="5.101">see that the judge in the Flynn case and</text>
  <text start="211.87" dur="4.56">we know that Mueller wanted to put this</text>
  <text start="214.15" dur="4.199">off once again because he really has no</text>
  <text start="216.43" dur="4.08">evidence whatsoever we understand that</text>
  <text start="218.349" dur="3.601">struck and others have changed and</text>
  <text start="220.51" dur="4.08">manipulated 302s</text>
  <text start="221.95" dur="5.429">and they changed a lot of it but the</text>
  <text start="224.59" dur="5.61">judge has now set the hearing for a July</text>
  <text start="227.379" dur="4.381">tenth and says that Flynn should be</text>
  <text start="230.2" dur="4.679">there and there is a notice of</text>
  <text start="231.76" dur="7.83">electronic filing the case is USA vers</text>
  <text start="234.879" dur="7.341">Flynn case number and it says that July</text>
  <text start="239.59" dur="5.58">10th at 10:00 a.m. in courtroom 24 a</text>
  <text start="242.22" dur="5.53">Flynn is directed to attend and its son</text>
  <text start="245.17" dur="5.039">it&amp;#39;s signed by Judge Emmett G Sullivan</text>
  <text start="247.75" dur="3.629">and it looks like we are moving forward</text>
  <text start="250.209" dur="3.06">with this and we&amp;#39;ll have to see what</text>
  <text start="251.379" dur="4.351">happens now q is saying that Flynn is</text>
  <text start="253.269" dur="4.381">going to be getting off there&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="255.73" dur="3.929">no evidence whatsoever and I think this</text>
  <text start="257.65" dur="3.6">is why Muller continually kicks the can</text>
  <text start="259.659" dur="4.471">down the street because he has nothing</text>
  <text start="261.25" dur="5.07">to show the judge just like in the case</text>
  <text start="264.13" dur="5.219">with the Russian company where they</text>
  <text start="266.32" dur="4.74">indicted like 13 Russians that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="269.349" dur="3.031">going too well either because he really</text>
  <text start="271.06" dur="3.06">had no evidence with that he never</text>
  <text start="272.38" dur="3.87">thought they&amp;#39;d show up so it looks like</text>
  <text start="274.12" dur="5.64">Muller is kind of stuck in this whole</text>
  <text start="276.25" dur="4.71">entire Russian collusion scenario which</text>
  <text start="279.76" dur="3.54">none of these things have to do with</text>
  <text start="280.96" dur="4.26">Russian collusion now we understand that</text>
  <text start="283.3" dur="5.13">Merkel was having problems with her own</text>
  <text start="285.22" dur="6.569">party and it all had to do with the</text>
  <text start="288.43" dur="6.15">refugees the illegals coming into the</text>
  <text start="291.789" dur="6.81">country and Merkel right now has</text>
  <text start="294.58" dur="6.899">surrendered her migration policy in a</text>
  <text start="298.599" dur="6.091">deal with the Conservative Party leader</text>
  <text start="301.479" dur="6.421">now this plan if implemented in its</text>
  <text start="304.69" dur="6.24">present form reduces Germany&amp;#39;s refugee</text>
  <text start="307.9" dur="6.06">liability almost to nothing since given</text>
  <text start="310.93" dur="6.01">Germany&amp;#39;s geography it is not on the</text>
  <text start="313.96" dur="5.05">front lines of the waves of migration</text>
  <text start="316.94" dur="4.38">as those migrants need to travel through</text>
  <text start="319.01" dur="4.71">another EU nation to get to Germany and</text>
  <text start="321.32" dur="4.53">if Germany is turning away asylum</text>
  <text start="323.72" dur="4.77">seekers who have filed for the asylum in</text>
  <text start="325.85" dur="4.86">another EU nation and a secondary</text>
  <text start="328.49" dur="3.99">migration is not permitted then Germany</text>
  <text start="330.71" dur="5.13">could realistically expect not to see</text>
  <text start="332.48" dur="5.31">further ways of migrants Merkel has lost</text>
  <text start="335.84" dur="4.53">in a big way and the anti-migrant</text>
  <text start="337.79" dur="3.75">interests have won not just at home but</text>
  <text start="340.37" dur="3.45">across the block</text>
  <text start="341.54" dur="5.07">she has conceded much and nearly lost</text>
  <text start="343.82" dur="5.58">her handle on power which has largely</text>
  <text start="346.61" dur="5.76">maintained through acquiescence to the</text>
  <text start="349.4" dur="5.49">demands of other countries in the Union</text>
  <text start="352.37" dur="5.55">so we see at this point that Merkel is</text>
  <text start="354.89" dur="6.48">in trouble a lot of her party is not</text>
  <text start="357.92" dur="6.02">with her and the people are not really</text>
  <text start="361.37" dur="4.89">with her and you can see that she is</text>
  <text start="363.94" dur="4.33">stuck at this point and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="366.26" dur="5.73">see how this all plays out later on</text>
  <text start="368.27" dur="5.97">moving forward here we see Iran the</text>
  <text start="371.99" dur="4.65">President of Iran Rohini</text>
  <text start="374.24" dur="5.52">he says he&amp;#39;s committed to the nuclear</text>
  <text start="376.64" dur="6.42">deal as long as we have the feeling that</text>
  <text start="379.76" dur="9.09">we can profit from the advantages given</text>
  <text start="383.06" dur="9.21">to Iran and we know that the Iranian</text>
  <text start="388.85" dur="6.84">president met with the Swiss counterpart</text>
  <text start="392.27" dur="5.31">in Zurich and the Swiss president Alain</text>
  <text start="395.69" dur="4.41">versat agreed saying that his country</text>
  <text start="397.58" dur="5.1">respects the deal adding we really agree</text>
  <text start="400.1" dur="5.1">with President rouhani on underlining</text>
  <text start="402.68" dur="5.13">the importance of stable relations and</text>
  <text start="405.2" dur="4.469">respect of international law and I</text>
  <text start="407.81" dur="4.74">believe what the Iranian president is</text>
  <text start="409.669" dur="6.181">doing right now is going around trying</text>
  <text start="412.55" dur="8.55">to get people on his side to make it</text>
  <text start="415.85" dur="7.98">profitable for Iran and again they want</text>
  <text start="421.1" dur="6.03">to receive payment remember Obama was</text>
  <text start="423.83" dur="4.92">sending payments to Iran and this had</text>
  <text start="427.13" dur="4.26">nothing to do with their funds because</text>
  <text start="428.75" dur="5.1">they put it on two planes on you know</text>
  <text start="431.39" dur="5.34">pallets of cash Congress really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="433.85" dur="5.43">know anything about this and they were</text>
  <text start="436.73" dur="5.12">just giving it to Iran so we see at this</text>
  <text start="439.28" dur="4.95">point Iran is trying to get those funds</text>
  <text start="441.85" dur="3.79">continually coming into the country and</text>
  <text start="444.23" dur="3.45">if they can&amp;#39;t get the funds coming into</text>
  <text start="445.64" dur="3.76">the country I don&amp;#39;t think this deal is</text>
  <text start="447.68" dur="4.12">going to stay alive</text>
  <text start="449.4" dur="6.21">we see Russian troops right now they</text>
  <text start="451.8" dur="5.94">have arrived in Bushra al-sham and the</text>
  <text start="455.61" dur="4.68">rebels are preparing to hand over their</text>
  <text start="457.74" dur="5.76">heaven their heavy weaponry and their</text>
  <text start="460.29" dur="6.15">medium weapons now this area is very</text>
  <text start="463.5" dur="4.68">important because it&amp;#39;s located just</text>
  <text start="466.44" dur="4.17">north of the Jordanian border and</text>
  <text start="468.18" dur="5.61">directly west of the AL sweida</text>
  <text start="470.61" dur="4.619">government and with Busra al sham under</text>
  <text start="473.79" dur="3.24">reconciliation deal</text>
  <text start="475.229" dur="3.931">the Syrian government will have full</text>
  <text start="477.03" dur="4.38">control of the al Shwetha provincial</text>
  <text start="479.16" dur="7.62">border for the first time in several</text>
  <text start="481.41" dur="8.96">years and we understand that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="486.78" dur="6.24">Armed Forces they have made a huge</text>
  <text start="490.37" dur="4.81">amount of gains in their country</text>
  <text start="493.02" dur="5.79">especially in the southern area of Syria</text>
  <text start="495.18" dur="6.27">and right now 27 settlements in the</text>
  <text start="498.81" dur="4.2">southern Syria area have returned to the</text>
  <text start="501.45" dur="5.189">government control over the past week</text>
  <text start="503.01" dur="6.27">and Syria is calling on all displaced</text>
  <text start="506.639" dur="5.34">citizens to return to the liberated</text>
  <text start="509.28" dur="5.67">areas all those areas where they removed</text>
  <text start="511.979" dur="4.74">the terrorists factions they want them</text>
  <text start="514.95" dur="4.469">to return and it looks like this is</text>
  <text start="516.719" dur="5.911">definitely happening right now now very</text>
  <text start="519.419" dur="5.941">interestingly senator Graham decided to</text>
  <text start="522.63" dur="4.77">visit Syria and he&amp;#39;s trying to make a</text>
  <text start="525.36" dur="4.32">case right now remember Graham and</text>
  <text start="527.4" dur="4.86">McCain or Q likes to call him no name</text>
  <text start="529.68" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;ve traveled together to many of</text>
  <text start="532.26" dur="5.4">these areas like Ukraine Syria and they</text>
  <text start="534.9" dur="6">pushed war in all of these areas right</text>
  <text start="537.66" dur="7.92">now Graham is insisting that the US</text>
  <text start="540.9" dur="8.14">needs to stay to help help with what if</text>
  <text start="545.58" dur="6.52">you look what Obama has done</text>
  <text start="549.04" dur="7.02">over the last eight years he was in</text>
  <text start="552.1" dur="7.14">office they&amp;#39;ve destroyed Syria destroyed</text>
  <text start="556.06" dur="6.75">Iraq destroyed Libya destroyed all these</text>
  <text start="559.24" dur="6.48">areas so what are what are they gonna</text>
  <text start="562.81" dur="8.3">help with the best thing that can happen</text>
  <text start="565.72" dur="7.62">here is that the u.s. leaves Syria and</text>
  <text start="571.11" dur="5.5">Graham is out there trying to make a</text>
  <text start="573.34" dur="6.6">case if the u.s. leaves the u.s. like</text>
  <text start="576.61" dur="5.31">Trump wants the troops to leave it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="579.94" dur="3.63">going to be terrible for Syria no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="581.92" dur="3.75">going to be good for Syria they have</text>
  <text start="583.57" dur="4.41">everything under control they almost</text>
  <text start="585.67" dur="4.56">have their country back and the people</text>
  <text start="587.98" dur="6.18">are coming back and the people elected</text>
  <text start="590.23" dur="7.08">Assad let their people decide where they</text>
  <text start="594.16" dur="6.78">want their country ago the u.s. right</text>
  <text start="597.31" dur="6.18">now has invaded Syria because we see</text>
  <text start="600.94" dur="5.67">right now that the Damascus government</text>
  <text start="603.49" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re out there saying that the United</text>
  <text start="606.61" dur="6.63">States must withdraw its forces from</text>
  <text start="609.01" dur="8.55">Syria stressing its military presence in</text>
  <text start="613.24" dur="7.29">Syria is no no longer makes any sense</text>
  <text start="617.56" dur="6.66">whatsoever since the Syrian government</text>
  <text start="620.53" dur="6">and the Russian forces have made huge</text>
  <text start="624.22" dur="4.92">successes on the ground in Syria and</text>
  <text start="626.53" dur="5.16">liberated many many areas and pretty</text>
  <text start="629.14" dur="3.87">much gotten rid of the paid mercenary</text>
  <text start="631.69" dur="4.29">forces in Syria</text>
  <text start="633.01" dur="5.25">now the Syrian parliamentary secretary</text>
  <text start="635.98" dur="5.34">said the United States can no longer</text>
  <text start="638.26" dur="6.36">keep its forces in Syria since it gains</text>
  <text start="641.32" dur="6.33">no benefits from it and that&amp;#39;s the whole</text>
  <text start="644.62" dur="7.14">point remember the reason they told us</text>
  <text start="647.65" dur="5.49">that the US was in Syria was to get rid</text>
  <text start="651.76" dur="3.51">of the Islamic state which we know was</text>
  <text start="653.14" dur="3.78">completely fake phony and false we knew</text>
  <text start="655.27" dur="4.08">that Obama was supporting the Islamic</text>
  <text start="656.92" dur="5.04">state now the Islamic state is beaten</text>
  <text start="659.35" dur="5.16">al-nusra is beaten al Qaeda is beaten</text>
  <text start="661.96" dur="5.13">the moderate rebels as they call them</text>
  <text start="664.51" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re surrendering they&amp;#39;re handing</text>
  <text start="667.09" dur="5.01">over their weapons why is the United</text>
  <text start="669.7" dur="4.69">States and Syria there&amp;#39;s no reason for</text>
  <text start="672.1" dur="4.87">it at this point</text>
  <text start="674.39" dur="5.76">it looks like the US and the coalition</text>
  <text start="676.97" dur="7.17">forces invaded Syria and when a country</text>
  <text start="680.15" dur="6.75">is telling you you must get out and you</text>
  <text start="684.14" dur="6.84">don&amp;#39;t it doesn&amp;#39;t look good on the world</text>
  <text start="686.9" dur="6.89">stage and I think this is why Trump has</text>
  <text start="690.98" dur="6.21">said that it is time to get out of Syria</text>
  <text start="693.79" dur="5.65">when Trump meets with Putin I think this</text>
  <text start="697.19" dur="4.23">is going to be discussed and I think</text>
  <text start="699.44" dur="5.61">we&amp;#39;re gonna see the troops removed from</text>
  <text start="701.42" dur="5.61">Syria and all borders closed down right</text>
  <text start="705.05" dur="3.99">now they are closing the borders with</text>
  <text start="707.03" dur="5.25">Jordan they&amp;#39;re closing and setting up</text>
  <text start="709.04" dur="4.56">barbed wire with Lebanon their control</text>
  <text start="712.28" dur="3.57">and they have the borders controlled</text>
  <text start="713.6" dur="5.73">with Iraq they&amp;#39;re controlling all the</text>
  <text start="715.85" dur="7.19">borders so the deep state can&amp;#39;t push the</text>
