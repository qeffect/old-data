  <text start="240.56" dur="4.739">to learn people that put time in created</text>
  <text start="243.17" dur="4.349">videos people are doing the research and</text>
  <text start="245.299" dur="5.491">people are doing the work to show you</text>
  <text start="247.519" dur="5.97">what to do that&amp;#39;s worth something it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="250.79" dur="6.93">not a bad thing in this world to make</text>
  <text start="253.489" dur="7.951">money it&amp;#39;s a bad thing when the central</text>
  <text start="257.72" dur="4.35">banks try to profit and enslave the</text>
  <text start="261.44" dur="3.449">people</text>
  <text start="262.07" dur="4.379">you do have a choice you can either go</text>
  <text start="264.889" dur="3.271">to the school or not go to the school</text>
  <text start="266.449" dur="3.391">you can either invest in crypto</text>
  <text start="268.16" dur="3.479">currencies or not invest invest in</text>
  <text start="269.84" dur="3.329">crypto currencies you can invest in gold</text>
  <text start="271.639" dur="3.571">you can vest in the Fayette dollar you</text>
  <text start="273.169" dur="5.18">invest in the stock market it&amp;#39;s all up</text>
  <text start="275.21" dur="6.78">to you you have all of these choices in</text>
  <text start="278.349" dur="6.431">my opinion I believe crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="281.99" dur="5.31">the blockchain system is separate and</text>
  <text start="284.78" dur="5.58">apart from the central banking system</text>
  <text start="287.3" dur="5.369">they&amp;#39;re demonizing it just like gold and</text>
  <text start="290.36" dur="5.85">silver there&amp;#39;s a reason they&amp;#39;re doing it</text>
  <text start="292.669" dur="5.011">now there might be a place in time where</text>
  <text start="296.21" dur="3.36">they decide they&amp;#39;re going to take</text>
  <text start="297.68" dur="3.09">control of it it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="299.57" dur="3.08">difficult because they would have to</text>
  <text start="300.77" dur="4.35">have every country around the world</text>
  <text start="302.65" dur="5.62">controlled like they are doing it right</text>
  <text start="305.12" dur="5.01">now and I think during this period of</text>
  <text start="308.27" dur="4.519">time that we&amp;#39;re in right now I think</text>
  <text start="310.13" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s going to be very very difficult and</text>
  <text start="312.789" dur="6.551">I think it&amp;#39;s gonna be hard for them to</text>
  <text start="316.13" dur="4.81">control a decentralized platform yes</text>
  <text start="319.34" dur="4.27">will they try to make it central</text>
  <text start="320.94" dur="5.64">will they try to control it in one point</text>
  <text start="323.61" dur="6.36">in in one location yes they will try to</text>
  <text start="326.58" dur="3.99">do that central banks are notorious for</text>
  <text start="329.97" dur="2.19">doing that</text>
  <text start="330.57" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;ve done it with all the paper</text>
  <text start="332.16" dur="3.45">currencies they&amp;#39;ve done it with gold and</text>
  <text start="333.66" dur="5.01">silver they&amp;#39;ve done it with everything</text>
  <text start="335.61" dur="6.96">they touched that&amp;#39;s the problem with the</text>
  <text start="338.67" dur="6.45">central banks they take systems that are</text>
  <text start="342.57" dur="6.03">good that our people run and they</text>
  <text start="345.12" dur="6.03">centralize it into their system to</text>
  <text start="348.6" dur="5.28">control it and we&amp;#39;re at the point in</text>
  <text start="351.15" dur="5.16">time where people are gonna have to make</text>
  <text start="353.88" dur="5.31">a decision and this is why I keep saying</text>
  <text start="356.31" dur="5.43">that we need to remove the central bank</text>
  <text start="359.19" dur="4.14">from the system no matter what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="361.74" dur="4.32">going to be going to an electronic</text>
  <text start="363.33" dur="4.29">payment system one way or another it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="366.06" dur="3.78">either going to be the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="367.62" dur="4.02">electronic payment system or it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="369.84" dur="3.42">to be the people&amp;#39;s electronic payment</text>
  <text start="371.64" dur="3.39">system I would like it to be the</text>
  <text start="373.26" dur="2.97">electronic payment system of the people</text>
  <text start="375.03" dur="4.35">where there are no central banks</text>
  <text start="376.23" dur="5.52">whatsoever and yes there is a little bit</text>
  <text start="379.38" dur="4.77">of a learning curve yes right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="381.75" dur="4.59">in the phase where crypto currencies are</text>
  <text start="384.15" dur="3.72">bobbing up and down people are getting</text>
  <text start="386.34" dur="2.7">nervous and a lot of people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="387.87" dur="3.63">understand cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="389.04" dur="6.48">this is why I joined up with crypto Z</text>
  <text start="391.5" dur="6.3">crypto cowboy V to help people learn</text>
  <text start="395.52" dur="4.08">about crypto currencies people have been</text>
  <text start="397.8" dur="4.14">emailing me like crazy so I said all</text>
  <text start="399.6" dur="3.9">right let me join up and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="401.94" dur="3.45">helping them now the first interview</text>
  <text start="403.5" dur="5.61">that I did with crypto Z cryptic cowboy</text>
  <text start="405.39" dur="5.82">and the rest we discuss everything about</text>
  <text start="409.11" dur="4.559">what the school was about about the</text>
  <text start="411.21" dur="4.17">training room and what you can expect</text>
  <text start="413.669" dur="3.091">now there are many people in the trading</text>
  <text start="415.38" dur="3.57">room there are many people that are</text>
  <text start="416.76" dur="3.54">making money there are many people that</text>
  <text start="418.95" dur="2.82">are learning about it there are many</text>
  <text start="420.3" dur="3.119">people that are doing all different</text>
  <text start="421.77" dur="4.01">things they&amp;#39;ve never dreamed that they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="423.419" dur="5.281">be able to do with crypto currency and</text>
  <text start="425.78" dur="7.15">they give you the choice of basically</text>
  <text start="428.7" dur="6.33">taking what you&amp;#39;ve earned and cashing</text>
  <text start="432.93" dur="5.97">out in gold and having the gold</text>
  <text start="435.03" dur="7.08">delivered to you so right now there are</text>
  <text start="438.9" dur="5.46">many countries out there and they are</text>
  <text start="442.11" dur="3.96">looking at the crypto market the</text>
  <text start="444.36" dur="3.15">blockchain system which is completely</text>
  <text start="446.07" dur="3.03">decentralized and old people keep</text>
  <text start="447.51" dur="5.31">telling me it&amp;#39;s centralized it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="449.1" dur="5.7">decentralized around the world and we</text>
  <text start="452.82" dur="6.63">see already that</text>
  <text start="454.8" dur="7.89">Iran China they&amp;#39;re looking into the</text>
  <text start="459.45" dur="5.43">cryptocurrency actually the Iranian MP</text>
  <text start="462.69" dur="4.47">sharing the Commission for Economic</text>
  <text start="464.88" dur="3.93">Affairs he suggested that Iran and</text>
  <text start="467.16" dur="4.05">Russia could use cryptocurrencies to</text>
  <text start="468.81" dur="5.31">overcome sanctions and use it to replace</text>
  <text start="471.21" dur="5.57">the Swift interbank payment system to</text>
  <text start="474.12" dur="5.76">execute international bank transfers</text>
  <text start="476.78" dur="6.6">this is going to be the next phase now</text>
  <text start="479.88" dur="7.02">the biggest question that we have is</text>
  <text start="483.38" dur="7.51">central bank our central banks going to</text>
  <text start="486.9" dur="6.54">control it hopefully not but no matter</text>
  <text start="490.89" dur="5.31">what if the central banks let&amp;#39;s say they</text>
  <text start="493.44" dur="5.37">do control it you have to understand it</text>
  <text start="496.2" dur="4.71">you have to know how it works if they</text>
  <text start="498.81" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t control it you still have to</text>
  <text start="500.91" dur="5.55">understand what it is and how it works</text>
  <text start="503.67" dur="4.38">because you need to understand what it</text>
  <text start="506.46" dur="3.87">does and you can see there&amp;#39;s a battle</text>
  <text start="508.05" dur="5.25">going on right now it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="510.33" dur="5.19">battle and this is going to continue on</text>
  <text start="513.3" dur="5.19">and I see the central banks continually</text>
  <text start="515.52" dur="4.709">demonizing the blockchain crypto market</text>
  <text start="518.49" dur="4.109">the same way they&amp;#39;re doing precious</text>
  <text start="520.229" dur="3.75">metals and with gold and silver where</text>
  <text start="522.599" dur="3.361">they&amp;#39;re continually demonizing and</text>
  <text start="523.979" dur="5.761">suppressing the prices they&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="525.96" dur="6.03">same exact thing but I&amp;#39;m hoping around</text>
  <text start="529.74" dur="5.94">the world and the people they all come</text>
  <text start="531.99" dur="5.4">together they all look at the situation</text>
  <text start="535.68" dur="3.75">and say you know something this is a</text>
  <text start="537.39" dur="4.2">system that can be used without the</text>
  <text start="539.43" dur="3.42">central banking system we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="541.59" dur="2.64">them any more we don&amp;#39;t need the banks</text>
  <text start="542.85" dur="4.14">anymore we don&amp;#39;t need any of this</text>
  <text start="544.23" dur="5.9">anymore we can control this on our own</text>
  <text start="546.99" dur="7.02">it&amp;#39;s almost like we started up our own</text>
  <text start="550.13" dur="6.94">fiat system and we decided to create our</text>
  <text start="554.01" dur="4.38">own currency right now now that would be</text>
  <text start="557.07" dur="4.55">outside the central banking system</text>
  <text start="558.39" dur="6.63">because we the people we&amp;#39;re creating it</text>
  <text start="561.62" dur="6.43">now can the central banks take it over</text>
  <text start="565.02" dur="5.19">well they did it back in 1913 we the</text>
  <text start="568.05" dur="6.12">people were creating our own currency in</text>
  <text start="570.21" dur="6.6">the central bank they bribed they got</text>
  <text start="574.17" dur="5.67">their foot in the door and they were</text>
  <text start="576.81" dur="5.46">able to take over the entire system this</text>
  <text start="579.84" dur="4.41">might happen with crypto currencies but</text>
  <text start="582.27" dur="5.52">we don&amp;#39;t know that as of yet but we as</text>
  <text start="584.25" dur="3.78">the people should fight against this now</text>
  <text start="587.79" dur="2.7">we</text>
  <text start="588.03" dur="5.19">been talking about the economy and how</text>
  <text start="590.49" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s completely breaking down and we see</text>
  <text start="593.22" dur="3.6">that the Fed is continually raising</text>
  <text start="595.59" dur="2.67">interest rates they&amp;#39;re saying maybe</text>
  <text start="596.82" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;ll do one more they said they were</text>
  <text start="598.26" dur="4.14">gonna do three to four during this year</text>
  <text start="600.45" dur="3.9">and we could see that they&amp;#39;re the the</text>
  <text start="602.4" dur="4.97">economy is starting to break down now</text>
  <text start="604.35" dur="5.55">and certain things are starting to</text>
  <text start="607.37" dur="4.93">completely implode like real estate</text>
  <text start="609.9" dur="4.08">we&amp;#39;re seeing student loans are slowing</text>
  <text start="612.3" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;re seeing automobile loans are</text>
  <text start="613.98" dur="3.72">slowing but we need to start paying</text>
  <text start="616.2" dur="3.36">attention to the LIBOR rate and I</text>
  <text start="617.7" dur="4.32">discussed this with Rob Kirby and Bill</text>
  <text start="619.56" dur="5.88">halter and we continually see the LIBOR</text>
  <text start="622.02" dur="5.13">rate continually moving up up and up and</text>
  <text start="625.44" dur="5.16">LIBOR stands for the London interbank</text>
  <text start="627.15" dur="7.38">offered rate an extremely an important</text>
  <text start="630.6" dur="6.39">rate when investors borrow money and use</text>

  <text start="825.389" dur="4.771">this is what we&amp;#39;re going to see and this</text>
  <text start="828.539" dur="4.17">is why we need to look at the library</text>
  <text start="830.16" dur="5.039">and not the Fed rate yes the Fed rate is</text>
  <text start="832.709" dur="6.451">important but the library is moving</text>
  <text start="835.199" dur="6.031">higher every single day and we can see</text>
  <text start="839.16" dur="3.539">there&amp;#39;s many many banks which are</text>
  <text start="841.23" dur="4.919">exposed especially in Europe especially</text>
  <text start="842.699" dur="4.86">in Italy actually and there was a study</text>
  <text start="846.149" dur="4.201">by the Bank of International Settlements</text>
  <text start="847.559" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;ve shown Italian government debt</text>
  <text start="850.35" dur="5.069">represents nearly 20% of Italian bank</text>

  <text start="855.419" dur="3.631">the world</text>
  <text start="855.87" dur="5.31">and they&amp;#39;re about ten banks with Italian</text>

  <text start="861.18" dur="5.88">over a hundred percent of their tier 1</text>

  <text start="873.12" dur="5.25">p.m. and there are many others now let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="876.45" dur="3.09">put this into perspective on what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="878.37" dur="4.77">really going on here</text>
  <text start="879.54" dur="6.03">remember the ECB the Fed Bank of Japan</text>
  <text start="883.14" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;ve been pumping in trillions of</text>
  <text start="885.57" dur="5.61">dollars with their QE programs and we</text>
  <text start="888.87" dur="3.48">know that these QE programs on the</text>
  <text start="891.18" dur="5.159">surface they&amp;#39;re going to be coming to an</text>
  <text start="892.35" dur="5.37">end and what this is going to do it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="896.339" dur="6.091">going to create something called the</text>
  <text start="897.72" dur="7.619">Doom loop and this Doom loop well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="902.43" dur="6.09">going to affect these banks now the Doom</text>
  <text start="905.339" dur="4.981">loop is when weakening government bonds</text>
  <text start="908.52" dur="4.38">threatened to topple the banks that own</text>
  <text start="910.32" dur="5.4">the bonds and in turn the banks start</text>
  <text start="912.9" dur="5.31">offloading them which causes these bonds</text>
  <text start="915.72" dur="5.22">to fall further thus pushing the</text>
  <text start="918.21" dur="4.68">government to the brink the doom loop is</text>
  <text start="920.94" dur="4.38">a particular problem in the eurozone</text>
  <text start="922.89" dur="5.22">since a member state doesn&amp;#39;t control its</text>
  <text start="925.32" dur="5.01">own currency and cannot print itself out</text>
  <text start="928.11" dur="4.05">of trouble which leaves it exposed to</text>
  <text start="930.33" dur="4.23">credit risk but it&amp;#39;s not just the</text>
  <text start="932.16" dur="4.17">Italian banks that are in trouble there</text>
  <text start="934.56" dur="4.38">are many other banks that are hooked</text>
  <text start="936.33" dur="4.379">into these Italian banks I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="938.94" dur="3.87">looking at French lenders we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="940.709" dur="4.891">at Spanish banks we&amp;#39;re looking at many</text>
  <text start="942.81" dur="4.32">other banks even US banks so when this</text>
  <text start="945.6" dur="3.09">thing starts to fall it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="947.13" dur="4.2">like a domino effect it&amp;#39;s going to hit</text>
  <text start="948.69" dur="4.35">every single one of these banks and we</text>
  <text start="951.33" dur="4.379">can see right now we&amp;#39;re getting to that</text>
  <text start="953.04" dur="5.85">point actually if you look at the credit</text>
  <text start="955.709" dur="4.651">cycle and you start to look at what has</text>
  <text start="958.89" dur="3.69">been happening and this is another</text>
  <text start="960.36" dur="4.71">indicator to show us that we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="962.58" dur="5.19">down the same exact path we hit the</text>
  <text start="965.07" dur="6.24">credal cycle peak in almost every single</text>
  <text start="967.77" dur="8.009">recession and back in the 90s we hit it</text>
  <text start="971.31" dur="8.79">at 43% in 2001 we hit it at like forty</text>
  <text start="975.779" dur="6.421">four and a half percent in 2008-2009 we</text>
  <text start="980.1" dur="5.64">hit it at forty five percent and right</text>
  <text start="982.2" dur="6.6">now we&amp;#39;re just barely above 45 percent</text>
  <text start="985.74" dur="3.78">we just hit the credit cycle peak which</text>
  <text start="988.8" dur="4.38">tells</text>
  <text start="989.52" dur="7.439">every time we hit this we end up in a</text>
  <text start="993.18" dur="6.09">recession and here we are once again at</text>
  <text start="996.959" dur="4.831">that credit cycle peak and Bill halter</text>
  <text start="999.27" dur="4.23">has discussed this many many times where</text>
  <text start="1001.79" dur="4.62">he says that credit is going to freeze</text>
  <text start="1003.5" dur="6.63">up because once we hit this credit cycle</text>
  <text start="1006.41" dur="6.23">peak it comes down like a rock falling</text>
  <text start="1010.13" dur="6.149">from the cliff it goes straight down and</text>
  <text start="1012.64" dur="6.55">once it comes down credit freezes up and</text>
  <text start="1016.279" dur="6.271">basically pensions are doomed</text>

  <text start="1024.11" dur="4.949">is frozen automobile loans are frozen</text>
  <text start="1026.9" dur="5.88">everything just freezes up because we</text>
  <text start="1029.059" dur="6.451">are a credit based society and we are at</text>
  <text start="1032.78" dur="5.399">that point once again and if you look at</text>
  <text start="1035.51" dur="5.12">all the indicators they are pointing to</text>
  <text start="1038.179" dur="5.571">one thing and one thing only right now</text>
