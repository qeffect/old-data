  <text start="328.71" dur="7.079">household is now one that 137 thousand</text>

  <text start="351.24" dur="6.12">are current currently living with family</text>
  <text start="353.849" dur="6.271">why because they can&amp;#39;t find the</text>
  <text start="357.36" dur="5.16">high-paying jobs yes I know the</text>
  <text start="360.12" dur="4.139">unemployment is at a very low rate but</text>
  <text start="362.52" dur="4.139">that is made up of a lot of part-time</text>
  <text start="364.259" dur="5.94">jobs where they count it as a full-time</text>
  <text start="366.659" dur="6.391">job and it&amp;#39;s very very misleading Larry</text>
  <text start="370.199" dur="6.9">Kotlikoff says the federal government is</text>
  <text start="373.05" dur="6.66">facing a fiscal gap of 210 trillion</text>
  <text start="377.099" dur="4.47">dollars over the next 75 years at this</text>
  <text start="379.71" dur="6.329">point twenty percent of US households</text>
  <text start="381.569" dur="7.771">have either 0 or negative wealth and</text>
  <text start="386.039" dur="7.38">this is how the central bank&amp;#39;s work they</text>
  <text start="389.34" dur="7.169">steal from the everyday person to make</text>
  <text start="393.419" dur="4.86">themselves very wealthy this is why when</text>
  <text start="396.509" dur="5.22">we look at all these numbers and we look</text>
  <text start="398.279" dur="5.281">and we go back in time you can see what</text>
  <text start="401.729" dur="5.43">has happened here I mean think about</text>
  <text start="403.56" dur="6.449">this for a second the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="407.159" dur="4.921">has put everyone into debt they owe a</text>
  <text start="410.009" dur="3.15">hundred and thirty seven thousand</text>
  <text start="412.08" dur="3.42">dollars</text>
  <text start="413.159" dur="4.051">I know people gonna say well I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="415.5" dur="3.69">feel it I don&amp;#39;t have to pay it guess</text>
  <text start="417.21" dur="5.85">what if they call in their marker you</text>
  <text start="419.19" dur="6.289">will have to pay it and you owe a</text>
  <text start="423.06" dur="6.69">hundred and thirty seven thousand but</text>
  <text start="425.479" dur="6.701">that figure is double the median</text>
  <text start="429.75" dur="6.06">household income so how do you pay that</text>
  <text start="432.18" dur="6.539">off over time and guess what the debt</text>
  <text start="435.81" dur="6.389">continually grows it&amp;#39;s an impossible</text>
  <text start="438.719" dur="5.73">situation you can see how many people</text>
  <text start="442.199" dur="4.65">have to live at home with other</text>
  <text start="444.449" dur="5.761">individuals because they can&amp;#39;t find the</text>
  <text start="446.849" dur="6.661">full-time high paying jobs you could see</text>
  <text start="450.21" dur="6.45">how health care has gone up</text>
  <text start="453.51" dur="4.68">I mean people can&amp;#39;t even afford that you</text>
  <text start="456.66" dur="3.93">could see how many stores are closing</text>
  <text start="458.19" dur="4.98">because people don&amp;#39;t have the funds to</text>
  <text start="460.59" dur="4.44">go out shopping I mean if you look at</text>
  <text start="463.17" dur="4.17">this you could see why this is all</text>
  <text start="465.03" dur="4.86">happening yes you have the stock market</text>
  <text start="467.34" dur="6.6">moving up five thousand points in 2017</text>
  <text start="469.89" dur="7.38">but does that really help you no it</text>
  <text start="473.94" dur="5.37">doesn&amp;#39;t help you at all if you look at</text>
  <text start="477.27" dur="4.44">what&amp;#39;s really happening to the people</text>
  <text start="479.31" dur="6.35">they are putting they&amp;#39;re being put into</text>
  <text start="481.71" dur="6">debt their wealth is being stolen and</text>
  <text start="485.66" dur="3.73">the situation is just gonna get worse</text>
  <text start="487.71" dur="5.34">because if you think about it twenty</text>
  <text start="489.39" dur="8.97">percent of all US households have either</text>
  <text start="493.05" dur="8.01">zero or a negative wealth that&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="498.36" dur="5.28">of people so when you look at the</text>
  <text start="501.06" dur="4.8">situation you can see that nothing has</text>
  <text start="503.64" dur="3.45">really improved actually over time it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="505.86" dur="3.18">getting worse now a lot of people can</text>
  <text start="507.09" dur="3.87">say well it&amp;#39;s only twenty percent of the</text>
  <text start="509.04" dur="5.58">US households that have either zero or</text>
  <text start="510.96" dur="6.03">negative wealth well guess what if you</text>
  <text start="514.62" dur="4.08">look at the other part of it where we</text>
  <text start="516.99" dur="3.84">have eighty percent you really think</text>
  <text start="518.7" dur="4.649">eighty percent has that much more</text>
  <text start="520.83" dur="6.15">because we see the other 20% has</text>
  <text start="523.349" dur="6.841">anywhere from maybe zero to five percent</text>
  <text start="526.98" dur="5.93">worth of wealth it doesn&amp;#39;t go from zero</text>
  <text start="530.19" dur="5.79">to negative to a hundred percent wealth</text>
  <text start="532.91" dur="5.02">it&amp;#39;s a step ladder so you&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="535.98" dur="4.77">looking at the top people that actually</text>
  <text start="537.93" dur="6">have the wealth the other 80% or even</text>
  <text start="540.75" dur="6.3">90% or even more than that they lost a</text>
  <text start="543.93" dur="4.74">lot of their wealth and yes there are</text>
  <text start="547.05" dur="3">still certain people out there that are</text>
  <text start="548.67" dur="4.86">still making it those people that were</text>
  <text start="550.05" dur="5.22">in the baby boom generation but the new</text>
  <text start="553.53" dur="3.63">generation that&amp;#39;s coming up they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="555.27" dur="4.02">finding it very very difficult to</text>
  <text start="557.16" dur="3.81">survive now we talked a lot about</text>
  <text start="559.29" dur="2.93">cryptocurrencies and how the central</text>
  <text start="560.97" dur="3.54">banks were making their move to</text>
  <text start="562.22" dur="4.81">basically take control of the crypto</text>
  <text start="564.51" dur="5.46">market we see that russia&amp;#39;s crypto rules</text>
  <text start="567.03" dur="5.19">well they&amp;#39;re not doing what everyone</text>
  <text start="569.97" dur="4.59">thought they were going to do now there</text>
  <text start="572.22" dur="3.72">was an earlier announcement where they</text>
  <text start="574.56" dur="3.51">made an announcement saying that the</text>
  <text start="575.94" dur="5.01">russian government was looking at crypto</text>
  <text start="578.07" dur="5.04">currencies and they were going to create</text>
  <text start="580.95" dur="4.5">rules around it one of the rules that</text>
  <text start="583.11" dur="4.41">they discussed at great length over the</text>
  <text start="585.45" dur="5.15">summer was a crypto</text>
  <text start="587.52" dur="5.31">and that has been shot down completely</text>
  <text start="590.6" dur="4.359">another one was integrating</text>
  <text start="592.83" dur="5.85">cryptocurrencies into day to day Russian</text>
  <text start="594.959" dur="6.961">life they got rid of that to regulation</text>
  <text start="598.68" dur="6.54">of miners and mining as taxable profits</text>
  <text start="601.92" dur="5.4">that they kept the this draft</text>
  <text start="605.22" dur="3.66">legislation is about as hostile to</text>
  <text start="607.32" dur="5.16">cryptocurrencies as it could possibly</text>
  <text start="608.88" dur="5.94">have been the Russian banking system and</text>
  <text start="612.48" dur="4.68">the politicians connected to that are</text>
  <text start="614.82" dur="5.75">the real Fifth Column</text>
  <text start="617.16" dur="7.049">within Russia and it looks like Putin</text>
  <text start="620.57" dur="5.2">has yet to get that part under control</text>
  <text start="624.209" dur="3.841">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="625.77" dur="4.11">that the central banks and remember</text>
  <text start="628.05" dur="4.83">their sole central bank in Russia the</text>
  <text start="629.88" dur="6.42">central bank in China central bank in</text>
  <text start="632.88" dur="7.86">most of the Western countries they want</text>
  <text start="636.3" dur="6.479">full control of this market and you have</text>
  <text start="640.74" dur="3.9">to remember what happened during the</text>
  <text start="642.779" dur="3.391">Internet boom where they thought it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="644.64" dur="3.03">just the Internet nobody really cares</text>
  <text start="646.17" dur="4.32">about it well they&amp;#39;ve learned their</text>
  <text start="647.67" dur="4.71">lesson they realize that they should</text>
  <text start="650.49" dur="3.57">have taken control of the Internet at</text>
  <text start="652.38" dur="3.449">that point this way they could shut down</text>
  <text start="654.06" dur="3.75">social media that have rules and</text>
  <text start="655.829" dur="3.661">regulations they wouldn&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="657.81" dur="3.57">alternative media they wouldn&amp;#39;t have all</text>
  <text start="659.49" dur="4.02">these problems so what they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="661.38" dur="4.38">right now is they&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="663.51" dur="3.87">crypto market and they&amp;#39;re saying okay we</text>
  <text start="665.76" dur="3.329">need to jump on this very very quickly</text>
  <text start="667.38" dur="4.5">now I know a lot of people think that</text>
  <text start="669.089" dur="4.861">the crypto market was created by the</text>
  <text start="671.88" dur="2.699">central bank&amp;#39;s or government or things</text>
  <text start="673.95" dur="2.91">like that</text>
  <text start="674.579" dur="5.01">maybe it was created by one of these</text>
  <text start="676.86" dur="5.91">individuals but it was not created by</text>
  <text start="679.589" dur="5.131">the central banking system to take</text>
  <text start="682.77" dur="3.87">control of the world currency because if</text>
  <text start="684.72" dur="4.14">they actually did that they wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="686.64" dur="4.08">make it a decentralized system they</text>
  <text start="688.86" dur="4.08">would make it where they already have</text>
  <text start="690.72" dur="4.17">control over it and all they had to do</text>
  <text start="692.94" dur="3.269">is pass laws they would make it so</text>
  <text start="694.89" dur="4.68">people can create so many different</text>
  <text start="696.209" dur="4.921">coins out there where they had to reel</text>
  <text start="699.57" dur="3.06">it in but we could see what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="701.13" dur="3.66">doing they&amp;#39;re looking at this and when</text>
  <text start="702.63" dur="3.81">it first started they didn&amp;#39;t really care</text>
  <text start="704.79" dur="3.6">about it nobody really cared about it</text>
  <text start="706.44" dur="3.63">and as time went on as more people</text>
  <text start="708.39" dur="4.23">looked at it and said hey we could use</text>
  <text start="710.07" dur="4.47">this this is a ledger system this is</text>
  <text start="712.62" dur="4.26">decentralized this is an honest system</text>
  <text start="714.54" dur="3.81">we could use it this is when they</text>
  <text start="716.88" dur="3.81">started to look at it and said hmm</text>
  <text start="718.35" dur="3.69">maybe we can&amp;#39;t let this go and</text>
  <text start="720.69" dur="3.51">further and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="722.04" dur="4.92">right now and we talked about a theory</text>
  <text start="724.2" dur="5.79">where they might be pumping the market</text>
  <text start="726.96" dur="5.22">up buying a lot of these coins pumping</text>
  <text start="729.99" dur="4.92">Bitcoin up and eventually going to sell</text>
  <text start="732.18" dur="5.13">it just to show that the crypto market</text>
  <text start="734.91" dur="3.84">without them is very volatile and this</text>
  <text start="737.31" dur="3.9">is why you need them if you go back to</text>
  <text start="738.75" dur="3.96">1913 prior to that this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="741.21" dur="4.05">they this is exactly what they did with</text>
  <text start="742.71" dur="4.41">paper currency where they said hey look</text>
  <text start="745.26" dur="3.51">it&amp;#39;s too volatile</text>
  <text start="747.12" dur="3.6">you need a central bank to run the</text>
  <text start="748.77" dur="4.26">system doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s digital or</text>
  <text start="750.72" dur="4.08">paper makes no difference they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="753.03" dur="5.13">the same strategy we see the Bank of</text>
  <text start="754.8" dur="5.55">England is now compiling a report that</text>
  <text start="758.16" dur="5.58">may lead to it issuing its own</text>
  <text start="760.35" dur="5.27">cryptocurrency and the cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="763.74" dur="6.27">might be based upon the value of</text>
  <text start="765.62" dur="6.67">sterling now banks do realize the</text>
  <text start="770.01" dur="4.56">potential that Kryptos underlying</text>
  <text start="772.29" dur="4.08">blockchain technology has to offer and</text>
  <text start="774.57" dur="5.25">they want to take full advantage of this</text>
  <text start="776.37" dur="5.55">plus they would love to cut out virtual</text>
  <text start="779.82" dur="4.83">currencies altogether in place it with</text>
  <text start="781.92" dur="4.29">something that they can control this is</text>
  <text start="784.65" dur="4.26">where they&amp;#39;re trying this is what</text>
  <text start="786.21" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re trying to do the Bank of England</text>
  <text start="788.91" dur="4.23">is expected to release a report this</text>
  <text start="791.22" dur="4.08">year that could leave the bank to issue</text>
  <text start="793.14" dur="4.41">its own cryptocurrency which would be</text>
  <text start="795.3" dur="4.8">tied to the value of the Sterling for</text>
  <text start="797.55" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s worth now there are a couple</text>
  <text start="800.1" dur="5.88">drawbacks to cryptocurrencies they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="802.32" dur="6.93">decentralized very hard to manage them</text>
  <text start="805.98" dur="6.63">in one location and we see Mark Carney</text>
  <text start="809.25" dur="5.73">the bank governor he&amp;#39;s saying that there</text>
  <text start="812.61" dur="3.75">is a potential fly in the soup when it</text>
  <text start="814.98" dur="3.08">comes to the Bank of England creating</text>
  <text start="816.36" dur="4.17">and releasing its own cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="818.06" dur="4.84">central banks currently use electronic</text>
  <text start="820.53" dur="5.55">payments but such exchanges are handled</text>
  <text start="822.9" dur="5.43">in a centralized fashion across counts</text>
  <text start="826.08" dur="4.08">at the central bank the trouble is that</text>
  <text start="828.33" dur="4.68">cryptocurrencies right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="830.16" dur="5.85">decentralized and it would allow people</text>
  <text start="833.01" dur="6.36">to skip the central intermediary and</text>
  <text start="836.01" dur="6.54">make instant payments to whomever they</text>
  <text start="839.37" dur="4.59">choose the shared ledger of the</text>
  <text start="842.55" dur="3.18">blockchain would enable people to open</text>
  <text start="843.96" dur="3.75">accounts at any bank at any time and</text>
  <text start="845.73" dur="4.44">move their accounts if needed actually</text>
  <text start="847.71" dur="4.26">I&amp;#39;ll go a step further they don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="850.17" dur="4.08">need the banks there&amp;#39;s no reason for</text>
  <text start="851.97" dur="5.58">them and this is what</text>
  <text start="854.25" dur="6.81">trying to get a hold of they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="857.55" dur="5.49">the crypto market decentralized they</text>
  <text start="861.06" dur="4.32">want it centralized where they can</text>
  <text start="863.04" dur="9.69">control this now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="865.38" dur="9.6">is that the Bitcoin surge in price could</text>
  <text start="872.73" dur="4.73">lead to two different things one they</text>
  <text start="874.98" dur="5.31">can pump it up pump it up pump it up</text>
  <text start="877.46" dur="5.41">sell because they&amp;#39;ve been using free</text>
  <text start="880.29" dur="5.07">money to pump it up sell it have it</text>
  <text start="882.87" dur="5.28">crash say it&amp;#39;s volatile move into their</text>
  <text start="885.36" dur="4.95">own maybe utility based type of coin</text>
  <text start="888.15" dur="3.81">where they can control it or a Fed coin</text>
  <text start="890.31" dur="3.3">whatever they&amp;#39;re going to use it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="891.96" dur="5.25">already waiting in the wings they</text>
  <text start="893.61" dur="7.61">already have it or and this is coming</text>
  <text start="897.21" dur="9.09">from Jeff Berwick they can use Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="901.22" dur="7.84">to crash the financial system where they</text>
  <text start="906.3" dur="5.13">could say Bitcoin as they pump it up</text>
  <text start="909.06" dur="4.44">pump it up pump it up they pull the rug</text>
  <text start="911.43" dur="4.11">out from under it they sell they crash</text>
  <text start="913.5" dur="4.41">it they could say this is leading into</text>
  <text start="915.54" dur="4.95">other things and it&amp;#39;s crashing the</text>
  <text start="917.91" dur="4.71">system and we could see that they could</text>
  <text start="920.49" dur="3.72">use this and say okay this is how we can</text>
  <text start="922.62" dur="5.43">get rid of cryptocurrencies completely</text>
  <text start="924.21" dur="5.52">because this decentralized model does</text>
  <text start="928.05" dur="4.35">not work for the central bank&amp;#39;s if they</text>
  <text start="929.73" dur="5.16">can&amp;#39;t get it to work and we can see that</text>
  <text start="932.4" dur="4.17">it can go either way right now and we</text>
  <text start="934.89" dur="4.11">can see this is how they could do it</text>
  <text start="936.57" dur="5.61">because if they can&amp;#39;t get another type</text>
  <text start="939" dur="4.56">of distraction they might use this</text>
  <text start="942.18" dur="3.42">distraction because we could see right</text>
  <text start="943.56" dur="3.69">now that this would be a perfect</text>
  <text start="945.6" dur="4.14">distraction it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what the</text>
  <text start="947.25" dur="4.41">distraction is they just need one they</text>
  <text start="949.74" dur="4.349">need it big enough to convince people</text>
  <text start="951.66" dur="4.53">this is why we need to move to a</text>
  <text start="954.089" dur="4.141">different system and this is why we need</text>
  <text start="956.19" dur="4.59">to get away from that and we need to</text>
  <text start="958.23" dur="4.98">move to something different now we could</text>
  <text start="960.78" dur="4.26">see that this could be a possibility but</text>
  <text start="963.21" dur="3.78">what I think is going to happen is I</text>
  <text start="965.04" dur="7.16">think they&amp;#39;re just gonna bring the</text>
  <text start="966.99" dur="8.07">system down and use Bitcoin as a</text>
  <text start="972.2" dur="3.88">volatile crypto currency and say all the</text>
  <text start="975.06" dur="3.15">other ones that are managed by the</text>
  <text start="976.08" dur="3.66">central banks they&amp;#39;re all volatile this</text>
  <text start="978.21" dur="4.77">is why you need to go to the utility</text>
  <text start="979.74" dur="6.27">based settlement coin and they created</text>
  <text start="982.98" dur="5.25">that on purpose so they can control it</text>
  <text start="986.01" dur="3.72">and I think the Fed coin</text>
  <text start="988.23" dur="5.73">if that is actually waiting in the wings</text>
  <text start="989.73" dur="7.92">they will use multiple coins around the</text>
  <text start="993.96" dur="5.49">world on their exchanges to make sure</text>
  <text start="997.65" dur="3.75">that everyone is using their system and</text>
  <text start="999.45" dur="4.23">what they need to do is they need to</text>
  <text start="1001.4" dur="4.89">convince governments to use this and</text>
  <text start="1003.68" dur="4.05">once they do that it&amp;#39;s game over and I</text>
  <text start="1006.29" dur="3.18">think this is where they&amp;#39;re headed I</text>
  <text start="1007.73" dur="4.23">think this is what they&amp;#39;re doing because</text>
  <text start="1009.47" dur="4.44">they realize the economy is completely</text>
  <text start="1011.96" dur="3.87">falling apart the peoples are coming I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1013.91" dur="3.06">talking about the manipulated numbers or</text>
  <text start="1015.83" dur="3.75">the stock market I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="1016.97" dur="6.57">actual economy here with corporations</text>
  <text start="1019.58" dur="5.01">with retail with all the loans the debt</text>
  <text start="1023.54" dur="3.45">that&amp;#39;s outstanding</text>
  <text start="1024.59" dur="4.65">this cannot be sustained the way it is</text>
  <text start="1026.99" dur="4.47">no matter which way you look at it it</text>
  <text start="1029.24" dur="5.37">cannot be sustained and they know this</text>
  <text start="1031.46" dur="5.34">they know their system was going to die</text>
  <text start="1034.61" dur="4.47">at a certain point and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1036.8" dur="4.14">get ahead of the game to basically</text>
  <text start="1039.08" dur="3.72">switch everything and blame it on</text>
  <text start="1040.94" dur="3.84">someone else and this is why we need to</text>
  <text start="1042.8" dur="4.95">go to a new system now they could make a</text>
  <text start="1044.78" dur="5.04">very good argument of why their new</text>
  <text start="1047.75" dur="4.29">crypto sir their new cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="1049.82" dur="3.81">system is going to be a lot better than</text>
  <text start="1052.04" dur="3.75">the old system the old system was</text>
  <text start="1053.63" dur="6.18">antique it wasn&amp;#39;t you know worth having</text>
  <text start="1055.79" dur="5.43">on a high level countries will use strs</text>
  <text start="1059.81" dur="4.02">on a low level will go completely</text>
  <text start="1061.22" dur="5.04">cashless it&amp;#39;ll be crypto will be you</text>
  <text start="1063.83" dur="5.13">know we&amp;#39;ll manage it everyone will have</text>
  <text start="1066.26" dur="4.26">to use this and this will be a better</text>
  <text start="1068.96" dur="4.5">system and you could see how they can</text>
  <text start="1070.52" dur="5.67">make this argument and blame the old</text>
  <text start="1073.46" dur="4.41">system for what has happened here and I</text>
  <text start="1076.19" dur="3.48">believe this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1077.87" dur="4.32">push for right now and this is where</text>
  <text start="1079.67" dur="5.31">they are headed no matter what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1082.19" dur="3.33">gonna be going through a collapse of the</text>
  <text start="1084.98" dur="3.42">system</text>
  <text start="1085.52" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;ll be moving on to a new system a new</text>
  <text start="1088.4" dur="4.11">system where we&amp;#39;re gonna have this</text>
  <text start="1089.75" dur="3.99">transition period it&amp;#39;s not going to be</text>
  <text start="1092.51" dur="3.51">overnight it didn&amp;#39;t happen overnight</text>
  <text start="1093.74" dur="4.5">when we moved on to the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="1096.02" dur="5.37">a lot of people were out of work we</text>
  <text start="1098.24" dur="5.82">couldn&amp;#39;t get oil we saw many many</text>
  <text start="1101.39" dur="4.98">problems during the 70s until things</text>
  <text start="1104.06" dur="4.41">started to calm down and of course back</text>
  <text start="1106.37" dur="3.81">then interest rates went up very very</text>
  <text start="1108.47" dur="3.99">high because they were printing a lot of</text>
  <text start="1110.18" dur="4.56">money at that time it was hitting the</text>
  <text start="1112.46" dur="4.98">public we saw the devaluation of the</text>
  <text start="1114.74" dur="4.8">dollar there was a lot of inflation we</text>
  <text start="1117.44" dur="4.589">saw a lot of wage growth houses were</text>
  <text start="1119.54" dur="3.599">going up in price this was all inflation</text>
  <text start="1122.029" dur="3.45">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="1123.139" dur="6.09">opposite we&amp;#39;re seeing wage growth</text>
  <text start="1125.479" dur="5.7">decline interest rates very low this is</text>
  <text start="1129.229" dur="4.5">what you see on the opposite side of the</text>
  <text start="1131.179" dur="4.651">system when it&amp;#39;s dying and we see right</text>
  <text start="1133.729" dur="4.65">now this is where we&amp;#39;re at we&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="1135.83" dur="4.469">close to this system completely falling</text>
