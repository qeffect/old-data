  <text start="85.1" dur="6.45">financial news now when all this started</text>
  <text start="87.91" dur="5.56">cue told us to trust the plan and this</text>
  <text start="91.55" dur="3.599">is a very difficult thing to do because</text>
  <text start="93.47" dur="3.81">a lot of people say yes I&amp;#39;m gonna trust</text>
  <text start="95.149" dur="4.351">the plan until the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="97.28" dur="4.71">comes out and the mainstream media puts</text>
  <text start="99.5" dur="4.44">out news and it counters everything that</text>
  <text start="101.99" dur="3.8">queue has been saying counters</text>
  <text start="103.94" dur="4.62">everything that you believe is happening</text>
  <text start="105.79" dur="5.35">counters your expectations and then you</text>
  <text start="108.56" dur="4.169">say well it looks like the plan isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="111.14" dur="5.07">going the way it seems</text>
  <text start="112.729" dur="5.791">and this is why Q says you need to trust</text>
  <text start="116.21" dur="6.81">the plan because as we go throughout</text>
  <text start="118.52" dur="7.23">this plan there&amp;#39;s going to be times that</text>
  <text start="123.02" dur="4.38">you feel fantastic times that you feel</text>
  <text start="125.75" dur="4.679">like what the hell&amp;#39;s going on here and</text>
  <text start="127.4" dur="7.32">that&amp;#39;s why Q is continually saying trust</text>
  <text start="130.429" dur="7.411">the plan and part of the plan is to make</text>
  <text start="134.72" dur="5.34">it seem like the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="137.84" dur="5.97">bankers the mainstream media they have</text>
  <text start="140.06" dur="5.82">full control it makes them do stupid</text>
  <text start="143.81" dur="4.56">things where they think that nothing can</text>
  <text start="145.88" dur="6.69">touch them that they&amp;#39;re controlling the</text>
  <text start="148.37" dur="7.38">narrative at the same exact time what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="152.57" dur="7.08">happening in the background well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="155.75" dur="5.16">executing the plan they don&amp;#39;t know this</text>
  <text start="159.65" dur="2.64">and I&amp;#39;m talking about that the central</text>
  <text start="160.91" dur="2.91">bank the mainstream media and everyone</text>
  <text start="162.29" dur="3.33">else they don&amp;#39;t realize that this is</text>
  <text start="163.82" dur="5.85">happening because they feel</text>
  <text start="165.62" dur="7.399">like they&amp;#39;re in control and this is what</text>
  <text start="169.67" dur="7.649">we see happening with the plan right now</text>
  <text start="173.019" dur="6.731">even with the economic plan I mean a lot</text>
  <text start="177.319" dur="4.051">of people think that oh look the central</text>
  <text start="179.75" dur="3.959">bank they&amp;#39;re going to be crashing the</text>
  <text start="181.37" dur="4.86">economy the mainstream media said that</text>
  <text start="183.709" dur="4.231">the economy is slowing and it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="186.23" dur="3.63">slow in 2019</text>
  <text start="187.94" dur="4.98">then we&amp;#39;re gonna have a recession in</text>
  <text start="189.86" dur="5.849">2020 and it doesn&amp;#39;t look good</text>
  <text start="192.92" dur="4.17">there are certain individuals that are</text>
  <text start="195.709" dur="5.011">running for president they try to attack</text>
  <text start="197.09" dur="6.149">the economy but it didn&amp;#39;t work and part</text>
  <text start="200.72" dur="7.799">of trumps plan is to make the economy</text>
  <text start="203.239" dur="7.771">look absolutely incredible every number</text>
  <text start="208.519" dur="5.131">that can be manipulated is being</text>
  <text start="211.01" dur="6.42">manipulated to make it look like the</text>
  <text start="213.65" dur="6.809">economy is absolutely fantastic but we</text>
  <text start="217.43" dur="6.419">need to think to ourselves how can he</text>
  <text start="220.459" dur="6.571">make a central bank debt-ridden economy</text>
  <text start="223.849" dur="4.741">look incredible yeah he can make an</text>
  <text start="227.03" dur="3.989">unemployment look fantastic</text>
  <text start="228.59" dur="5.97">he could make GDP look at him fantastic</text>
  <text start="231.019" dur="7.021">and while he&amp;#39;s doing that behind the</text>
  <text start="234.56" dur="7.14">scenes he&amp;#39;s unraveling everything</text>
  <text start="238.04" dur="8.099">they&amp;#39;ve done in the last many many years</text>
  <text start="241.7" dur="8.28">and this takes some time and he needs to</text>
  <text start="246.139" dur="6.72">make sure that they do not bring down</text>
  <text start="249.98" dur="4.68">the economy because once they bring down</text>
  <text start="252.859" dur="4.951">the economy and Trump is telling</text>
  <text start="254.66" dur="5.43">everyone the economy is great and they</text>
  <text start="257.81" dur="2.76">do it on their terms well Trump is</text>
  <text start="260.09" dur="2.699">finished</text>
  <text start="260.57" dur="5.819">he knows this cue knows this the</text>
  <text start="262.789" dur="7.731">Patriots know this this is why Trump has</text>
  <text start="266.389" dur="9.09">taken full control of the entire system</text>
  <text start="270.52" dur="9.28">he&amp;#39;s even taking control of the Fed how</text>
  <text start="275.479" dur="8.75">do we know this the Fed was on course to</text>
  <text start="279.8" dur="6.989">raise rates four to five times this year</text>
  <text start="284.229" dur="6.551">so far how many times have they raised</text>
  <text start="286.789" dur="6.391">the interest rate in 2019 zero what</text>
  <text start="290.78" dur="7.56">month are we in we are in the month of</text>
  <text start="293.18" dur="6.36">March and what four days which is very</text>
  <text start="298.34" dur="5.28">interesting</text>
  <text start="299.54" dur="5.97">the Federal Reserve is going to meet now</text>
  <text start="303.62" dur="8.13">think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="305.51" dur="9.92">March 19th this is the date that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="311.75" dur="5.88">counting down to this is the date the</text>
  <text start="315.43" dur="6.64">lawyers for Epstein have to make the</text>
  <text start="317.63" dur="9.57">case to keep all those documents sealed</text>
  <text start="322.07" dur="8.7">up this is the date that the central</text>
  <text start="327.2" dur="7.17">bankers meet and discuss whether they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="330.77" dur="5.97">going to raise the rates or not now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="334.37" dur="5.22">starting to look like they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="336.74" dur="5.07">to do anything and we&amp;#39;ll be talking</text>
  <text start="339.59" dur="6.87">about that in just a minute</text>
  <text start="341.81" dur="9.27">but first we need to understand that the</text>
  <text start="346.46" dur="9.32">central bank system does not benefit the</text>
  <text start="351.08" dur="7.62">people we&amp;#39;ve been sold a bill of goods</text>
  <text start="355.78" dur="7.48">where they&amp;#39;ve been telling us through</text>
  <text start="358.7" dur="7.89">all our education since 1913 that the</text>
  <text start="363.26" dur="8.22">central bank&amp;#39;s way is the only way that</text>
  <text start="366.59" dur="8.01">debt is good credit debt and everything</text>
  <text start="371.48" dur="8.21">else is fantastic and the more debt</text>
  <text start="374.6" dur="7.62">you&amp;#39;re in it&amp;#39;s great inflation is good</text>
  <text start="379.69" dur="5.05">they don&amp;#39;t mention that inflation means</text>
  <text start="382.22" dur="6.54">the value of their debt Note is losing</text>
  <text start="384.74" dur="6.84">value and this brings me to the minimum</text>
  <text start="388.76" dur="4.86">wage the minimum wage and I know a lot</text>
  <text start="391.58" dur="4.02">of people believe this they think well</text>
  <text start="393.62" dur="2.91">if we raise the minimum wage everything</text>
  <text start="395.6" dur="4.23">will be okay</text>
  <text start="396.53" dur="6.12">no that&amp;#39;s furthest from the truth</text>
  <text start="399.83" dur="5.45">think about it the minimum wage</text>
  <text start="402.65" dur="6">well they increase this many many times</text>
  <text start="405.28" dur="6.34">they have to continually increase it why</text>
  <text start="408.65" dur="4.88">think about it for a second why would</text>
  <text start="411.62" dur="6.42">you have to increase the minimum wage</text>
  <text start="413.53" dur="9.79">because it takes more of the same debt</text>
  <text start="418.04" dur="8.58">notes to pay for the same items you</text>
  <text start="423.32" dur="6.71">always been paying for this is an</text>
  <text start="426.62" dur="6.59">incredible indicator to let you know how</text>
  <text start="430.03" dur="7.2">the central bank system is I mean right</text>
  <text start="433.21" dur="8.04">now the minimum wage is around what $15</text>
  <text start="437.23" dur="6.35">an hour and guess what happens when you</text>
  <text start="441.25" dur="6.21">continually raise the minimum wage</text>
  <text start="443.58" dur="7.53">it doesn&amp;#39;t help employment it actually</text>
  <text start="447.46" dur="6.45">increases unemployment what do employers</text>
  <text start="451.11" dur="5.92">normally do when they have to pay their</text>
  <text start="453.91" dur="8.21">workers more money especially when the</text>
  <text start="457.03" dur="8.06">company is not taking in more currency</text>
  <text start="462.12" dur="7.9">well they either cut back on the hours</text>
  <text start="465.09" dur="9.37">or they get rid of people this is</text>
  <text start="470.02" dur="6.93">exactly what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing so there</text>
  <text start="474.46" dur="4.76">is no success when raising the mandated</text>
  <text start="476.95" dur="5.07">minimum price of Labor above the</text>
  <text start="479.22" dur="5.17">productivity of a lesser skilled worker</text>
  <text start="482.02" dur="4.35">a recent report by the New York City</text>
  <text start="484.39" dur="5.16">Hospital hospitality Alliance warns</text>
  <text start="486.37" dur="6.9">about the loss of wages and jobs it</text>

  <text start="523.539" dur="6.771">in 2019 as a result of the minimum wage</text>
  <text start="526.51" dur="5.76">going up now this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="530.31" dur="5.98">well everyone says well what about</text>
  <text start="532.27" dur="6.42">Amazon they gave everyone $50 $15 an</text>
  <text start="536.29" dur="3.45">hour and they&amp;#39;re fantastic but you</text>
  <text start="538.69" dur="5.61">didn&amp;#39;t see what happened in the</text>
  <text start="539.74" dur="6.599">background yes they received $15 but</text>
  <text start="544.3" dur="4.2">guess what the businesses will always</text>
  <text start="546.339" dur="2.461">take it from someplace else what did</text>
  <text start="548.5" dur="4.62">they do</text>
  <text start="548.8" dur="6.27">well Amazon eliminated in order to</text>
  <text start="553.12" dur="5.43">accommodate the lower level salaries</text>
  <text start="555.07" dur="6.45">stock options an employee after two</text>
  <text start="558.55" dur="5.07">years of service would receive one share</text>
  <text start="561.52" dur="8.19">of the e-tailer stock</text>
  <text start="563.62" dur="10.409">valued today at 1670 $1 and one share</text>
  <text start="569.71" dur="6.6">each year after but Amazon traded that</text>
  <text start="574.029" dur="5.371">option for the instant gratification of</text>
  <text start="576.31" dur="7.86">a few extra dollars even less after</text>
  <text start="579.4" dur="7.439">taxes in each paycheck so yes on the</text>
  <text start="584.17" dur="5.97">front it sounds fantastic but they</text>
  <text start="586.839" dur="4.471">remove something to accommodate the</text>
  <text start="590.14" dur="2.88">money being paid out to these</text>
  <text start="591.31" dur="5.91">individuals now what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="593.02" dur="8.94">over time is that the value of the debt</text>
  <text start="597.22" dur="9.75">Note is going to lose value and the</text>
  <text start="601.96" dur="8.73">fifteen dollars will only be worth 13 12</text>
  <text start="606.97" dur="9.03">11 10 and then people will be</text>
  <text start="610.69" dur="8.7">complaining again what&amp;#39;s the main source</text>
  <text start="616" dur="7.38">of the problem the central bank</text>
  <text start="619.39" dur="7.32">what is the plan of the Patriots to get</text>
  <text start="623.38" dur="6.59">rid of the source of the problem Trump</text>
  <text start="626.71" dur="7.53">right now is bringing back manufacturing</text>
  <text start="629.97" dur="6.79">deregulating creating better trade deals</text>
  <text start="634.24" dur="6.27">as best as he can do in the Central Bank</text>
  <text start="636.76" dur="7.41">economy and he&amp;#39;s preparing the economy</text>
  <text start="640.51" dur="6.18">so the economy can function once we get</text>
  <text start="644.17" dur="8.13">rid of the central bank once we get rid</text>
  <text start="646.69" dur="8.61">of their system in order to do this he</text>
  <text start="652.3" dur="5.159">needs to control them right now he needs</text>
  <text start="655.3" dur="5.13">to take the control away from the</text>
  <text start="657.459" dur="7.531">Rothschilds and since the Federal</text>
  <text start="660.43" dur="9.06">Reserve is the reserve currency central</text>
  <text start="664.99" dur="8.219">bank system right now well Trump can</text>
  <text start="669.49" dur="6.9">control other central bank&amp;#39;s because the</text>
  <text start="673.209" dur="5.371">if the Fed is going to say listen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="676.39" dur="3.569">not going to move right now or we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="678.58" dur="6.03">gonna lower rates or we&amp;#39;re gonna do this</text>
  <text start="679.959" dur="8.311">other central banks will follow because</text>
  <text start="684.61" dur="7.29">they can&amp;#39;t act without the Federal</text>
  <text start="688.27" dur="5.819">Reserve so the Federal Reserve right now</text>
  <text start="691.9" dur="5.429">is going to be patient a little bit</text>
  <text start="694.089" dur="5.521">longer the word is that after this</text>
  <text start="697.329" dur="3.66">meeting on the 19th it looks like</text>
  <text start="699.61" dur="3.839">they&amp;#39;re going to wait until the third</text>
  <text start="700.989" dur="5.551">quarter to consider raising it raising</text>
  <text start="703.449" dur="4.26">the interest rate one more time they</text>
  <text start="706.54" dur="4.529">don&amp;#39;t feel like they&amp;#39;re in a hurry right</text>
  <text start="707.709" dur="6.391">now to change rates there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="711.069" dur="4.351">reason to do it we&amp;#39;re looking at all the</text>
  <text start="714.1" dur="3.75">numbers actually the numbers have looked</text>
  <text start="715.42" dur="5.699">haven&amp;#39;t looked this good since who knows</text>
  <text start="717.85" dur="6.57">when so they&amp;#39;re not in a hurry to raise</text>
  <text start="721.119" dur="6.51">the target rate anytime soon and if we</text>
  <text start="724.42" dur="5.31">go back in time to September October</text>
  <text start="727.629" dur="3.661">November December 2018</text>
  <text start="729.73" dur="3.539">they were like oh yes we&amp;#39;re still gonna</text>
  <text start="731.29" dur="4.199">raise it three to four times maybe three</text>
  <text start="733.269" dur="4.29">times and we remember during this period</text>
  <text start="735.489" dur="5.13">Trump was continually contradicting the</text>
  <text start="737.559" dur="4.291">fed over and over and over and then all</text>
  <text start="740.619" dur="4.47">of a sudden they said okay well raise in</text>
  <text start="741.85" dur="4.679">December but January where we were</text>
  <text start="745.089" dur="3.06">slated to raise it we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
