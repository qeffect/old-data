  <text start="42.66" dur="4.26">episode is the central banks have</text>
  <text start="44.55" dur="5.91">prepared the economy for a fifty percent</text>
  <text start="46.92" dur="6.239">market collapse let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="50.46" dur="5.55">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="53.159" dur="4.711">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at many of the</text>
  <text start="56.01" dur="3.81">economic indicators for quite a while</text>
  <text start="57.87" dur="4.31">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking this following it</text>
  <text start="59.82" dur="5.489">and we can see this is the lead-up to</text>
  <text start="62.18" dur="7.66">the collapsing economy the collapsing</text>
  <text start="65.309" dur="7.831">dollar the collapsing of the petro</text>
  <text start="69.84" dur="4.17">dollar and we can see right now even</text>
  <text start="73.14" dur="2.909">though the United States government</text>
  <text start="74.01" dur="4.14">central bankers have not announced it</text>
  <text start="76.049" dur="3.871">where we haven&amp;#39;t gotten the stock</text>
  <text start="78.15" dur="3.45">market&amp;#39;s signal which i like to call</text>
  <text start="79.92" dur="3.78">with because that is the last indicator</text>
  <text start="81.6" dur="6.9">showing us that we are in some type of</text>
  <text start="83.7" dur="8.58">recession or depression but what we are</text>
  <text start="88.5" dur="8.73">seeing right now is the economy</text>
  <text start="92.28" dur="6.33">contracting we are in a recession a lot</text>
  <text start="97.23" dur="3.99">of the indicators are much much worse</text>
  <text start="98.61" dur="4.23">than two thousand eight already just</text>
  <text start="101.22" dur="2.9">because the government doesn&amp;#39;t tell you</text>
  <text start="102.84" dur="3.72">about it doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s not happening</text>
  <text start="104.12" dur="4.21">they didn&amp;#39;t tell you that the subprime</text>
  <text start="106.56" dur="3.66">securities were garbage but they were</text>
  <text start="108.33" dur="4.95">they were telling you they were triple-a</text>
  <text start="110.22" dur="5.7">and I know that&amp;#39;s Moody&amp;#39;s and S&amp;amp;P but it</text>
  <text start="113.28" dur="4.56">was backed up by the US government they</text>
  <text start="115.92" dur="3.809">didn&amp;#39;t look into it they didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="117.84" dur="6.38">look into it they knew exactly what was</text>
  <text start="119.729" dur="6.841">happening and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="124.22" dur="4.539">the u.s. government central bankers</text>
  <text start="126.57" dur="3.839">they&amp;#39;re going to continually keep the</text>
  <text start="128.759" dur="3.181">illusion alive until the very end and</text>
  <text start="130.409" dur="2.64">even through the illusion they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="131.94" dur="2.909">even tell us that we&amp;#39;re in a recession</text>
  <text start="133.049" dur="4.77">or depression they&amp;#39;re going to tell us</text>
  <text start="134.849" dur="4.591">months and months later on but I can see</text>
  <text start="137.819" dur="3.691">through the corporate media what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="139.44" dur="5.329">trying to do at this point because they</text>
  <text start="141.51" dur="6.21">continually bring up the idea is that if</text>
  <text start="144.769" dur="6.61">companies are hiring if they are hiring</text>
  <text start="147.72" dur="6.93">for the holiday season the economy must</text>
  <text start="151.379" dur="6.06">be good because I see you know UPS is</text>
  <text start="154.65" dur="5.63">going to be hiring 79,000 temporary</text>
  <text start="157.439" dur="6.391">people kohl&amp;#39;s is thinking about hiring</text>
  <text start="160.28" dur="6.28">69,000 temporary people</text>
  <text start="163.83" dur="5.64">because you&amp;#39;re saying you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="166.56" dur="6.42">hire these people and you do it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="169.47" dur="5.64">mean that you&amp;#39;re going to have sales it</text>
  <text start="172.98" dur="5.46">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that retail is going to be</text>
  <text start="175.11" dur="6.48">good it doesn&amp;#39;t mean anything actually</text>
  <text start="178.44" dur="5.22">because there are a lot of stores that</text>
  <text start="181.59" dur="6.09">hired many many people that completely</text>
  <text start="183.66" dur="6.87">went out of business they&amp;#39;re hoping that</text>
  <text start="187.68" dur="5.46">there&amp;#39;s going to be sales they&amp;#39;re hoping</text>
  <text start="190.53" dur="5.12">that this is the case but just because</text>
  <text start="193.14" dur="5.4">someone is hiring temporary employees</text>
  <text start="195.65" dur="5.86">it&amp;#39;s absolutely meaningless because what</text>
  <text start="198.54" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;ve seen up to this point is that all</text>
  <text start="201.51" dur="3.15">these individuals are gonna be sitting</text>
  <text start="202.86" dur="2.88">around doing nothing and eventually</text>
  <text start="204.66" dur="3.09">what&amp;#39;s going to happen after this</text>
  <text start="205.74" dur="4.86">holiday season just like last holiday</text>
  <text start="207.75" dur="4.59">season the sales are going to be</text>
  <text start="210.6" dur="4.65">declining and we&amp;#39;re going to see more</text>
  <text start="212.34" dur="4.83">and more stores closing but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="215.25" dur="4.32">trying to use this to convince you that</text>
  <text start="217.17" dur="5.039">well if they&amp;#39;re hiring that must mean</text>
  <text start="219.57" dur="4.62">the economy is doing well no it means</text>
  <text start="222.209" dur="4.831">absolutely nothing means they&amp;#39;re hiring</text>
  <text start="224.19" dur="6.299">temporary people paying them low wages</text>
  <text start="227.04" dur="5.85">to stand around as their sales drop and</text>
  <text start="230.489" dur="5.191">then after everything is all said and</text>
  <text start="232.89" dur="5.28">done they&amp;#39;ll tell us that Oh sales</text>
  <text start="235.68" dur="4.32">didn&amp;#39;t go that well we have to close</text>
  <text start="238.17" dur="3.81">more stores that&amp;#39;s exactly what happened</text>
  <text start="240" dur="4.26">last year they told us how many people</text>
  <text start="241.98" dur="4.32">that were hiring they told us how great</text>
  <text start="244.26" dur="4.86">the holiday season was going to be they</text>
  <text start="246.3" dur="5.01">were telling us how a cyber monday Black</text>
  <text start="249.12" dur="5.55">Friday going to be incredible it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="251.31" dur="7.2">pan out it was awful and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="254.67" dur="5.64">doing is they&amp;#39;re preparing everyone to</text>
  <text start="258.51" dur="3.63">make everyone believe that everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="260.31" dur="4.07">going to be fine hoping that this will</text>
  <text start="262.14" dur="4.74">bring shoppers out this holiday season</text>
  <text start="264.38" dur="5.2">but as this economy continually</text>
  <text start="266.88" dur="4.83">collapses we need to look at their</text>
  <text start="269.58" dur="4.23">actions not what they&amp;#39;re telling us not</text>
  <text start="271.71" dur="5.34">what they&amp;#39;re saying but what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="273.81" dur="5.16">really thinking and we can see that ken</text>
  <text start="277.05" dur="3.48">rogoff who was who is a Harvard</text>
  <text start="278.97" dur="4.5">professor on the former IMF chief</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="6.15">economist he is still out there talking</text>
  <text start="283.47" dur="7.86">about a cashless society he&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="286.68" dur="9.39">about how we need to go into negative</text>
  <text start="291.33" dur="9.28">interest rates how the economy needs to</text>
  <text start="296.07" dur="5.83">go cashless and we can see that the US</text>
  <text start="300.61" dur="4.11">government central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="301.9" dur="5.519">getting worried they&amp;#39;re worried about</text>
  <text start="304.72" dur="6.419">the people making runs on the bank</text>
  <text start="307.419" dur="6.181">taking their cash out they&amp;#39;re worried</text>
  <text start="311.139" dur="6.09">because if they don&amp;#39;t they go into</text>
  <text start="313.6" dur="5.46">negative interest rate territory people</text>
  <text start="317.229" dur="5.521">are going to say why do I need to keep</text>
  <text start="319.06" dur="6.27">my currency in the bank so these go hand</text>
  <text start="322.75" dur="4.86">in hand cassius society negative</text>
  <text start="325.33" dur="4.47">interest rates because they&amp;#39;ve seen what</text>
  <text start="327.61" dur="5.07">has happened out in Europe where there</text>
  <text start="329.8" dur="5.04">is negative interest rates and people</text>
  <text start="332.68" dur="3.54">then went ahead and they took their</text>
  <text start="334.84" dur="3.829">currency out of the bank because they</text>
  <text start="336.22" dur="5.49">said why would I need it in there and</text>
  <text start="338.669" dur="7">they need your currency in there because</text>
  <text start="341.71" dur="6.179">they&amp;#39;re prepared for balance and this is</text>
  <text start="345.669" dur="6.261">why they are continually bringing this</text>
  <text start="347.889" dur="9.81">up there hoping and preparing the public</text>
  <text start="351.93" dur="9.43">for what is about to happen because the</text>
  <text start="357.699" dur="4.831">central bankers they control the system</text>
  <text start="361.36" dur="3.809">we know this we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="362.53" dur="6.05">this they can keep the system alive</text>
  <text start="365.169" dur="5.551">while the real economy falls apart</text>
  <text start="368.58" dur="3.309">because when we say keep the system</text>
  <text start="370.72" dur="3.18">alive we&amp;#39;re talking about the stock</text>
  <text start="371.889" dur="4.741">market we&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="373.9" dur="6.389">manipulated numbers but they can&amp;#39;t stop</text>
  <text start="376.63" dur="6.63">the stores from closing they can&amp;#39;t push</text>
  <text start="380.289" dur="6.331">people to spend more money they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="383.26" dur="6.06">push people to purchase homes they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="386.62" dur="4.65">push people to do things that needs to</text>
  <text start="389.32" dur="4.71">be done to keep the economy afloat</text>
  <text start="391.27" dur="5.25">because remember our GDP is made up of</text>
  <text start="394.03" dur="3.99">what seventy percent of spending and as</text>
  <text start="396.52" dur="4.769">more and more people lose their jobs as</text>
  <text start="398.02" dur="6.149">more and more people cut back the</text>
  <text start="401.289" dur="6.75">spending decreases and this is a problem</text>
  <text start="404.169" dur="7.321">for them and the central bankers they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="408.039" dur="6.921">set the system up to fail and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="411.49" dur="8.73">starting to look very very similar to</text>
  <text start="414.96" dur="8.26">the Great Depression and the common</text>
  <text start="420.22" dur="4.74">narrative back during the great</text>
  <text start="423.22" dur="4.56">depression is that the Fed didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="424.96" dur="4.62">enough and of course this is used to</text>
  <text start="427.78" dur="5.129">justify the feds use of non</text>
  <text start="429.58" dur="8.88">stop extraordinary monetary policy since</text>
  <text start="432.909" dur="6.931">2008 but we know it&amp;#39;s a total lie if you</text>
  <text start="438.46" dur="4.799">really look at what happened have in</text>
  <text start="439.84" dur="5.25">1929 the Fed went bananas they expanded</text>
  <text start="443.259" dur="4.771">their balance sheet by three hundred</text>
  <text start="445.09" dur="5.52">percent the fed&amp;#39;s balance sheet group</text>
  <text start="448.03" dur="6.12">from five percent of u.s. gdp to</text>
  <text start="450.61" dur="7.679">twenty-three percent of gdp this is an</text>
  <text start="454.15" dur="8.28">expansion relative to GDP is really</text>
  <text start="458.289" dur="8.16">identical to what the Fed did since 2008</text>
  <text start="462.43" dur="8.25">and the outcome of all of this is</text>
  <text start="466.449" dur="8.22">looking the same in 1933 CPI began</text>
  <text start="470.68" dur="6.57">erupting higher by 1937 CPI was</text>
  <text start="474.669" dur="7.041">three-point-six percent the Fed was</text>
  <text start="477.25" dur="8.37">forced to hike rates to halt inflation</text>
  <text start="481.71" dur="8.679">kicking the weak US economy in the teeth</text>
  <text start="485.62" dur="10.109">and triggering the biggest recession</text>
  <text start="490.389" dur="10.43">depression collapse we&amp;#39;ve seen well</text>
  <text start="495.729" dur="8.461">today we have the same problem core CPI</text>
  <text start="500.819" dur="6.28">hit the feds alleged two percent in</text>
  <text start="504.19" dur="5.909">November and that was in November of</text>
  <text start="507.099" dur="5.85">2015 and has remained above it ever</text>
  <text start="510.099" dur="5.701">since so inflation is rising right now</text>
  <text start="512.949" dur="5.88">and this is why they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="515.8" dur="6.75">talking about raising the rates because</text>
  <text start="518.829" dur="7.921">they know once they do this this entire</text>
  <text start="522.55" dur="6.899">system when I say the system I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="526.75" dur="8.49">about the stock market will come down</text>
  <text start="529.449" dur="7.411">fifty percent or so the US economy I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="535.24" dur="4.14">talking about the US economy I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="536.86" dur="4.65">about jobs I&amp;#39;m talking about production</text>
  <text start="539.38" dur="4.05">I&amp;#39;m talking about manufacturing I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="541.51" dur="7.43">talking about corporate defaults of</text>
  <text start="543.43" dur="8.46">talking about retail I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="548.94" dur="6.88">automobiles I&amp;#39;m talking about everything</text>
  <text start="551.89" dur="6.33">else that we&amp;#39;ve been covering when the</text>
  <text start="555.82" dur="6.12">Fed decides that we&amp;#39;re going to raise</text>
  <text start="558.22" dur="4.63">these interest rates we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="561.94" dur="4.78">the same thing</text>
  <text start="562.85" dur="10.349">that occurred back in 1937 where the</text>
  <text start="566.72" dur="9.41">stock market crumbled it halved we are</text>
  <text start="573.199" dur="5.461">going to see the same thing today and</text>
  <text start="576.13" dur="5.519">why are they all doing this what what is</text>
  <text start="578.66" dur="9.119">the purpose of old as well the system is</text>
  <text start="581.649" dur="9.731">done it can&amp;#39;t go anywhere the whole</text>
  <text start="587.779" dur="7.74">entire system is dead there is too much</text>
  <text start="591.38" dur="8.1">debt and they&amp;#39;re running out of places</text>
  <text start="595.519" dur="8.101">to push the debt and the petro dollar is</text>
  <text start="599.48" dur="6.75">under threat this is why congressman</text>
  <text start="603.62" dur="6">they have expressed their concerns over</text>
  <text start="606.23" dur="5.64">the mounting national national debt what</text>
  <text start="609.62" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;re saying right now is that the</text>
  <text start="611.87" dur="10.55">mounting national debt is now a threat</text>
  <text start="615.8" dur="11.01">to them to uh to national security so</text>
  <text start="622.42" dur="7.06">the house of representative is saying</text>
  <text start="626.81" dur="5.31">that the government is not ready to</text>
  <text start="629.48" dur="4.32">radically deal with the issues because</text>
  <text start="632.12" dur="4.74">the authorities do not want to reduce</text>
  <text start="633.8" dur="5.459">spending because as we know the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="636.86" dur="4.529">right now besides losing trillions and</text>
  <text start="639.259" dur="4.7">trillions of dollars which we know was</text>
  <text start="641.389" dur="4.861">siphoned off and used for other reasons</text>
  <text start="643.959" dur="5.74">they&amp;#39;re receiving about fifty percent of</text>
  <text start="646.25" dur="7.47">the budget right now and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="649.699" dur="8.19">going to cut anything so we can see</text>
  <text start="653.72" dur="7.26">right now that this debt problem has</text>
  <text start="657.889" dur="5.7">reached a point where they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="660.98" dur="5.969">it&amp;#39;s a threat to national security so we</text>
  <text start="663.589" dur="5.461">have this huge problem with debt we have</text>
  <text start="666.949" dur="6.45">an economy that&amp;#39;s falling apart Europe</text>
  <text start="669.05" dur="6.659">is reeling right now and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="673.399" dur="6.36">trying to keep the manipulation</text>
  <text start="675.709" dur="6.081">continually going why because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="679.759" dur="5.221">getting ready to transition us</text>
  <text start="681.79" dur="5.649">transition us away from the dollar we</text>
  <text start="684.98" dur="5.93">know this many things were on the table</text>
  <text start="687.439" dur="7.871">right now one of them being the SDR and</text>
  <text start="690.91" dur="8.14">we can see right now that this has been</text>
  <text start="695.31" dur="7.53">this has been pushed for quite a while</text>
  <text start="699.05" dur="6.97">China right now there you want is</text>
  <text start="702.84" dur="4.62">included in the SDR basket China has</text>
  <text start="706.02" dur="4.44">made it clear that there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="707.46" dur="6.11">change and the United States has to go</text>
  <text start="710.46" dur="7.35">along with it because remember China</text>
  <text start="713.57" dur="6.459">holds a large portion of the US</text>
  <text start="717.81" dur="5.79">government debt and they&amp;#39;re calling the</text>

  <text start="790.14" dur="10.41">and we can see right now is that the</text>
  <text start="796.41" dur="7.34">central bankers they are preparing to</text>
  <text start="800.55" dur="4.98">make a transition over to a new system</text>
  <text start="803.75" dur="2.83">now they&amp;#39;ve been telling us that</text>
  <text start="805.53" dur="2.91">everything is fine with the dollar</text>
  <text start="806.58" dur="4.62">telling us that the economy is fine the</text>
  <text start="808.44" dur="4.95">world economy is fine there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="811.2" dur="4.259">wrong so how do they make this</text>
  <text start="813.39" dur="4.11">announcement where they say okay now</text>
  <text start="815.459" dur="4.471">we&amp;#39;re getting ready to rid of the dollar</text>
  <text start="817.5" dur="5.7">we&amp;#39;re making a transition we need to go</text>
  <text start="819.93" dur="5.52">someplace else well back in the 70s they</text>
  <text start="823.2" dur="5.44">talked about speculators we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="825.45" dur="5.71">come off the gold standard and this</text>
  <text start="828.64" dur="5.04">the beginning of a new system where we</text>
  <text start="831.16" dur="5.28">came off a system that was quite solid</text>
  <text start="833.68" dur="6.48">today we&amp;#39;re coming off a system which is</text>
  <text start="836.44" dur="6.6">doomed a system which is too big because</text>
  <text start="840.16" dur="6.44">of the debt the system that is not</text>
  <text start="843.04" dur="8.1">operational anymore the economy is</text>
  <text start="846.6" dur="8.71">collapsing and this is while the keeping</text>
  <text start="851.14" dur="6.69">the illusion alive and we can see right</text>
  <text start="855.31" dur="4.92">now they&amp;#39;re getting ready to make this</text>
  <text start="857.83" dur="4.89">transition to move us to the next step</text>
  <text start="860.23" dur="5.19">and this is why we&amp;#39;re going to see some</text>
  <text start="862.72" dur="6.69">type of collapse of the system some type</text>
  <text start="865.42" dur="7.13">of transition now will this go perfectly</text>
  <text start="869.41" dur="7.02">smooth and everything will be fine maybe</text>
  <text start="872.55" dur="7.9">but I doubt it I believe it will be</text>
  <text start="876.43" dur="5.37">smooth for the elite the one percent but</text>
  <text start="880.45" dur="3.21">for everyone else I think it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="881.8" dur="4.5">be horrific think about when they moved</text>
  <text start="883.66" dur="4.89">us from the gold standard onto the petro</text>
  <text start="886.3" dur="5.84">dollar system how many people were out</text>
  <text start="888.55" dur="7.65">of jobs the devaluation of the dollar</text>
  <text start="892.14" dur="5.98">how they had a inflate how many people</text>
  <text start="896.2" dur="4.44">couldn&amp;#39;t find work at that time how we</text>
  <text start="898.12" dur="5.87">couldn&amp;#39;t get fuel this time it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="900.64" dur="8.22">to be much worse this time the system is</text>
  <text start="903.99" dur="8.56">going to be much much worse because we</text>
  <text start="908.86" dur="7.5">have a huge amount of debt and once we</text>
  <text start="912.55" dur="6.99">come off the petro dollar system once we</text>
  <text start="916.36" dur="6.36">move into the SDR once we start making</text>
  <text start="919.54" dur="6.6">this transition well this is where the</text>
  <text start="922.72" dur="5.61">problem comes in because you think about</text>
  <text start="926.14" dur="4.65">this for a second I mean major</text>
  <text start="928.33" dur="5.88">commodities like oil they&amp;#39;ll need to be</text>
  <text start="930.79" dur="6.69">pricing sdrs the banking system needs to</text>
  <text start="934.21" dur="4.74">create deposits and loans in SDR as well</text>
  <text start="937.48" dur="4.68">as the dollar as we go through this</text>
  <text start="938.95" dur="6.54">transition I mean gold might provide a</text>
  <text start="942.16" dur="5.19">counterweight to impact the depreciation</text>
  <text start="945.49" dur="4.77">appreciation of the dollar or other</text>
  <text start="947.35" dur="7.8">currencies but we can see this is going</text>
  <text start="950.26" dur="6.99">to be a rough period of time and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="955.15" dur="5.01">getting closer and closer to this point</text>
  <text start="957.25" dur="4.5">and this is why everyone needs to be</text>
  <text start="960.16" dur="4.02">ready and prepared</text>
