  <text start="133.66" dur="6.93">guess what would happen nothing and</text>
  <text start="136.22" dur="8.19">that&amp;#39;s exactly what just happened here I</text>
  <text start="140.59" dur="7.06">mean we&amp;#39;re 29 months later and the UK is</text>
  <text start="144.41" dur="6.39">no closer to being out of the EU than</text>
  <text start="147.65" dur="7.26">the day of the vote why because Teresa</text>
  <text start="150.8" dur="8.67">mais 585 page deal is the worst of all</text>
  <text start="154.91" dur="8.34">possible outcomes if it passes it will</text>
  <text start="159.47" dur="6.24">leave the EU with near full control over</text>
  <text start="163.25" dur="4.32">Britta trade and tax policy while the</text>
  <text start="165.71" dur="4.2">British people and government have no</text>
  <text start="167.57" dur="4.56">say or vote in the matter it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="169.91" dur="3.87">punishment for the people getting uppity</text>
  <text start="172.13" dur="4.11">about their future and wanting something</text>
  <text start="173.78" dur="5.25">different than what had been planned for</text>
  <text start="176.24" dur="5.04">them remember if we go back many many</text>
  <text start="179.03" dur="5.16">reports we always said the central</text>
  <text start="181.28" dur="7.32">bankers will never allow this to happen</text>
  <text start="184.19" dur="8.13">and central bankers always punish those</text>
  <text start="188.6" dur="5.28">who don&amp;#39;t do what they want look at the</text>
  <text start="192.32" dur="4.08">countries where the people wanted a</text>
  <text start="193.88" dur="5.19">regime change from the puppet government</text>
  <text start="196.4" dur="5.01">they are then punished the same thing is</text>
  <text start="199.07" dur="4.23">happening here and if you really look at</text>
  <text start="201.41" dur="5.87">the brexit the people said listen we</text>
  <text start="203.3" dur="7.95">want to leave the EU and the government</text>
  <text start="207.28" dur="6.61">didn&amp;#39;t do what the people wanted so the</text>
  <text start="211.25" dur="5.22">government is actually not working for</text>
  <text start="213.89" dur="4.38">the people I mean may has tried to run</text>
  <text start="216.47" dur="4.14">out the clock and scare everyone into</text>
  <text start="218.27" dur="5.28">accepting a deal that is worse than the</text>
  <text start="220.61" dur="6.27">situation pre brexit because somehow a</text>
  <text start="223.55" dur="5.909">terrible deal is better than no deal but</text>
  <text start="226.88" dur="5.25">that&amp;#39;s the opposite of the truth the</text>
  <text start="229.459" dur="5.191">biggest takeaway from this brexit Fiasco</text>
  <text start="232.13" dur="4.56">is that even more people will check out</text>
  <text start="234.65" dur="4.53">of the political system and the people</text>
  <text start="236.69" dur="6.71">will wake up and start to realize well</text>
  <text start="239.18" dur="8.309">their government is not working for them</text>
  <text start="243.4" dur="8.02">now we know the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="247.489" dur="5.011">need control and control over everything</text>
  <text start="251.42" dur="3.72">if they don&amp;#39;t have control and</text>
  <text start="252.5" dur="6.57">continually put countries into debt they</text>
  <text start="255.14" dur="7.86">lose power and this will be the biggest</text>
  <text start="259.07" dur="6.63">fight that we&amp;#39;ll ever see when the</text>
  <text start="263" dur="6.27">Patriots the rest of the countries go up</text>
  <text start="265.7" dur="6.45">against the central bank and we try to</text>
  <text start="269.27" dur="4.2">remove it and the central bank just</text>
  <text start="272.15" dur="3.36">doesn&amp;#39;t sit back and allow this to</text>
  <text start="273.47" dur="4.11">happen they will fight back with</text>
  <text start="275.51" dur="6.3">everything they have they will make it</text>
  <text start="277.58" dur="8.04">seem like that they&amp;#39;re the victim of all</text>
  <text start="281.81" dur="6.12">of this and they will use underhanded</text>
  <text start="285.62" dur="4.2">methods in trying to keep their power</text>
  <text start="287.93" dur="4.77">and what I mean by that is like events</text>
  <text start="289.82" dur="5.07">war and other things like that but what</text>
  <text start="292.7" dur="4.1">is happening here throughout the entire</text>
  <text start="294.89" dur="4.489">world there</text>
  <text start="296.8" dur="5.25">system their system it is falling apart</text>
  <text start="299.379" dur="5.19">right now if we look at the United</text>
  <text start="302.05" dur="5.22">States right now tell total household</text>
  <text start="304.569" dur="6.301">debt hit a new record high rising by two</text>
  <text start="307.27" dur="5.76">hundred and nineteen billion so we are</text>
  <text start="310.87" dur="4.859">at thirteen point five trillion in the</text>
  <text start="313.03" dur="4.74">third quarter of 2018 and this is coming</text>
  <text start="315.729" dur="4.201">from the feds latest household debt</text>
  <text start="317.77" dur="4.2">report remember their whole business</text>
  <text start="319.93" dur="4.44">revolves around debt they brain</text>
  <text start="321.97" dur="5.729">washington and to us thinking that debt</text>
  <text start="324.37" dur="5.91">is fantastic it&amp;#39;s a great thing this is</text>
  <text start="327.699" dur="5.491">the 17th consecutive quarter with an</text>
  <text start="330.28" dur="4.379">increase in household debt and the total</text>
  <text start="333.19" dur="3.689">is now eight hundred and thirty seven</text>
  <text start="334.659" dur="4.621">billion higher than the previous peak of</text>
  <text start="336.879" dur="6.241">twelve point six eight trillion from the</text>
  <text start="339.28" dur="6.78">third quarter of 2008 so the people</text>
  <text start="343.12" dur="6.509">since the Great Recession have put on a</text>
  <text start="346.06" dur="7.139">lot more debt which is not a good thing</text>
  <text start="349.629" dur="6.181">and we&amp;#39;re seeing delinquencies hit a</text>
  <text start="353.199" dur="4.53">six-year high right now which means as</text>
  <text start="355.81" dur="5.4">they take on more debt it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="357.729" dur="5.581">harder and harder to pay back the loans</text>
  <text start="361.21" dur="4.56">they take out the credit card loans they</text>
  <text start="363.31" dur="5.25">take out the mortgages the auto loans</text>
  <text start="365.77" dur="5.94">the student loans you name it now</text>
  <text start="368.56" dur="7.53">remember as the central bank system dies</text>
  <text start="371.71" dur="6.06">what happens here well people can&amp;#39;t live</text>
  <text start="376.09" dur="5.1">on what they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="377.77" dur="5.61">and this is why credit was introduced to</text>
  <text start="381.19" dur="4.949">allow people to go out and purchase</text>
  <text start="383.38" dur="6.599">things if you took away all the credit</text>
  <text start="386.139" dur="7.231">cards all the student loans all the auto</text>
  <text start="389.979" dur="7.5">loans and just had people try to survive</text>
  <text start="393.37" dur="5.97">on what they earned the population would</text>
  <text start="397.479" dur="4.8">not be able to do it yes you would have</text>
  <text start="399.34" dur="5.669">certain 1% or the certain two percent</text>
  <text start="402.279" dur="5.01">would be able to get by but when you</text>
  <text start="405.009" dur="4.051">look at the bulk of people that are</text>
  <text start="407.289" dur="4.41">running the country that fuel the</text>
  <text start="409.06" dur="5.039">country they wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to survive</text>
  <text start="411.699" dur="4.381">they wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to buy food they</text>
  <text start="414.099" dur="3.141">wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to have these cars they</text>
  <text start="416.08" dur="4.1">wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to live in the house</text>
  <text start="417.24" dur="6.489">they wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to do any of this</text>
  <text start="420.18" dur="5.65">because everything is too expensive and</text>
  <text start="423.729" dur="3.36">that the value of the dollar continually</text>
  <text start="425.83" dur="3.36">decreases this is why they hadn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="427.089" dur="3.661">introduced auto loans I mean think about</text>
  <text start="429.19" dur="3.99">it when cars first they came out</text>
  <text start="430.75" dur="3.84">it was cash that it was financing the</text>
  <text start="433.18" dur="3.33">knee extended financing then they had to</text>
  <text start="434.59" dur="4.08">go into leasing now it&amp;#39;s like you know</text>
  <text start="436.51" dur="3.96">rent the time that you need the car and</text>
  <text start="438.67" dur="4.74">the other time you don&amp;#39;t have to pay for</text>
  <text start="440.47" dur="5.79">it someone else will rent it all this</text>
  <text start="443.41" dur="6.03">came into being is because the entire</text>
  <text start="446.26" dur="5.28">system breaks down but they try to hide</text>
  <text start="449.44" dur="5.76">it same thing with food and other</text>
  <text start="451.54" dur="6.56">products they shrink packages they</text>
  <text start="455.2" dur="6.87">substitute ingredients they don&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="458.1" dur="5.8">material that is strong so equipment</text>
  <text start="462.07" dur="4.05">doesn&amp;#39;t break down they go for the</text>
  <text start="463.9" dur="5.519">cheaper stuff and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="466.12" dur="5.97">seeing we see industrial production that</text>
  <text start="469.419" dur="5.431">has slowed right now and it slowed once</text>
  <text start="472.09" dur="5.07">again in October and it is really going</text>
  <text start="474.85" dur="4.319">absolutely nowhere it is declining very</text>
  <text start="477.16" dur="4.35">rapidly at this point and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="479.169" dur="5.491">interesting is that we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="481.51" dur="5.94">about how Trump has been using reverse</text>
  <text start="484.66" dur="4.67">psychology on the mainstream media on</text>
  <text start="487.45" dur="4.95">the deep State on the central bank and</text>
  <text start="489.33" dur="4.99">we know that and I think that Powell is</text>
  <text start="492.4" dur="4.17">actually working with him because I</text>
  <text start="494.32" dur="3.96">think Trump put a person in there that</text>
  <text start="496.57" dur="4.89">would do exactly what he wanted him to</text>
  <text start="498.28" dur="5.04">do and that is raise interest rates now</text>
  <text start="501.46" dur="4.8">in the beginning the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="503.32" dur="5.88">was out there and they were applauding</text>
  <text start="506.26" dur="4.8">the Fed interest rates raised them as</text>
  <text start="509.2" dur="3.87">high as you can this is fantastic this</text>
  <text start="511.06" dur="5.49">is a great thing keep going keep going</text>
  <text start="513.07" dur="5.82">and the reason they were applauding this</text>
  <text start="516.55" dur="5.76">is because they thought they had the</text>
  <text start="518.89" dur="5.94">upper hand they thought okay great the</text>
  <text start="522.31" dur="4.26">Fed is in control the deep state is in</text>
  <text start="524.83" dur="4.32">control we&amp;#39;re gonna be going to war</text>
  <text start="526.57" dur="5.51">they&amp;#39;ll crash the economy we&amp;#39;ll blame it</text>
  <text start="529.15" dur="5.91">on the war and it will look fantastic</text>
  <text start="532.08" dur="4.54">but what happened was over this period</text>
  <text start="535.06" dur="3.93">of time and if you noticed when Trump</text>
  <text start="536.62" dur="3.9">came into office they raised the rates</text>
  <text start="538.99" dur="2.97">right before he came into office and</text>
  <text start="540.52" dur="3.17">they raised it a couple more times when</text>
  <text start="541.96" dur="4.23">he was in office and they kept going</text>
  <text start="543.69" dur="4.21">this was because they thought they were</text>
  <text start="546.19" dur="4.53">going to control the narrative they</text>
  <text start="547.9" dur="4.439">thought okay let him have the economy we</text>
  <text start="550.72" dur="4.17">know it&amp;#39;s gonna fall apart the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="552.339" dur="5.491">doing terribly we built it up on an</text>
  <text start="554.89" dur="5.85">illusion he won&amp;#39;t know what to do guess</text>
  <text start="557.83" dur="5.86">what he doesn&amp;#39;t know what to do he used</text>
  <text start="560.74" dur="5.08">the same trickery that they used</text>
  <text start="563.69" dur="3.75">and he pumped up the economy and that</text>
  <text start="565.82" dur="3.69">doesn&amp;#39;t mean the economy&amp;#39;s doing well he</text>
  <text start="567.44" dur="4.46">used these statistical numbers to make</text>
  <text start="569.51" dur="4.77">it look like the economy was doing well</text>
  <text start="571.9" dur="3.97">then they sat there and said whoa wait a</text>
  <text start="574.28" dur="4.77">minute what&amp;#39;s going on here then he</text>
  <text start="575.87" dur="4.92">started to criticize the Fed and say hey</text>
  <text start="579.05" dur="6.57">the feds raising rates this is not a</text>
  <text start="580.79" dur="8.4">good time that&amp;#39;s coming due soon why</text>
  <text start="585.62" dur="7.8">would we do this at this point and the</text>
  <text start="589.19" dur="6.78">mainstream media they were stuck they</text>
  <text start="593.42" dur="5.94">didn&amp;#39;t know what to do because they were</text>
  <text start="595.97" dur="5.91">rooting for the Fed to raise rates now</text>
  <text start="599.36" dur="5.91">the economy&amp;#39;s doing fantastically on</text>
  <text start="601.88" dur="5.82">paper and they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen</text>
  <text start="605.27" dur="4.89">because if they keep pushing the Fed to</text>
  <text start="607.7" dur="6.51">raise rates the Fed will be blamed for</text>
  <text start="610.16" dur="5.84">the entire system coming down what do we</text>
  <text start="614.21" dur="4.92">see happening right now</text>
  <text start="616" dur="4.42">financial pundits mainstream media like</text>
  <text start="619.13" dur="6.09">The Wall Street Journal and many others</text>
  <text start="620.42" dur="8.52">are telling the Fed to slow down slow</text>
  <text start="625.22" dur="7.08">down the rate hikes don&amp;#39;t move too</text>
  <text start="628.94" dur="7.23">quickly now this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="632.3" dur="7.35">because Trump has the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="636.17" dur="8.19">the financial pundits telling the Fed to</text>
  <text start="639.65" dur="6.03">do exactly what he wants the Fed to do</text>
  <text start="644.36" dur="3.86">but he really doesn&amp;#39;t want them to do</text>
  <text start="645.68" dur="4.8">this he wants them to raise their rates</text>
  <text start="648.22" dur="4.44">so think about what&amp;#39;s happening right</text>
  <text start="650.48" dur="2.18">now</text>
  <text start="652.81" dur="9.49">this will allow Trump to blame the Fed</text>
  <text start="658.58" dur="6.74">think about it for a second he&amp;#39;s blaming</text>
  <text start="662.3" dur="6.539">the Fed now he has the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="665.32" dur="6.25">financial pundits also telling the Fed</text>
  <text start="668.839" dur="6.271">to do the same thing so when the economy</text>
  <text start="671.57" dur="5.519">comes down guess what the mainstream</text>
  <text start="675.11" dur="3.63">media told the Fed to slow down the</text>
