  <text start="61.21" dur="5.07">collapse of the central bankers system</text>
  <text start="63.79" dur="5.22">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="66.28" dur="6.54">financial news now as we can see the</text>
  <text start="69.01" dur="7.53">world is completely going haywire right</text>
  <text start="72.82" dur="6.51">now the economy is falling apart at a</text>
  <text start="76.54" dur="7.98">quicker pace than we&amp;#39;ve ever seen before</text>
  <text start="79.33" dur="9.3">and Trump does know this he realizes</text>
  <text start="84.52" dur="6.45">that the Fed put things into motion he</text>
  <text start="88.63" dur="5.31">understands and not just Trump but there</text>
  <text start="90.97" dur="5.58">are good guys in the group and they</text>
  <text start="93.94" dur="5.039">realize that the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="96.55" dur="4.83">bankers they are pushing their agenda to</text>
  <text start="98.979" dur="4.621">collapse the economy and when Trump</text>
  <text start="101.38" dur="4.5">talked about bringing back jobs bringing</text>
  <text start="103.6" dur="3.51">back manufacturing jobs and doing all</text>
  <text start="105.88" dur="4.02">this stuff I&amp;#39;ve always said from the</text>
  <text start="107.11" dur="6.72">beginning this is most likely for after</text>
  <text start="109.9" dur="7.56">the reset once this entire Fiat system</text>
  <text start="113.83" dur="5.429">is completely wiped out that&amp;#39;s when the</text>
  <text start="117.46" dur="4.34">jobs and everything will come back and</text>
  <text start="119.259" dur="7.14">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="121.8" dur="8.379">entire economy is falling apart very</text>
  <text start="126.399" dur="5.341">very rapidly now retail sales for the</text>
  <text start="130.179" dur="4.351">second month in a row they&amp;#39;ve declined</text>
  <text start="131.74" dur="6.03">in March and the hard data right now</text>
  <text start="134.53" dur="6.03">well it&amp;#39;s not living up to the soft</text>
  <text start="137.77" dur="5.91">data&amp;#39;s hype what we&amp;#39;re really seeing is</text>
  <text start="140.56" dur="6.45">that the real information the real</text>
  <text start="143.68" dur="6.27">economic collapse of the system is</text>
  <text start="147.01" dur="5.88">shining through right now and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="149.95" dur="5.85">seeing is that this is spreading and we</text>
  <text start="152.89" dur="6.33">can see with retail things are ripping</text>
  <text start="155.8" dur="5.79">itself apart retail hasn&amp;#39;t been doing</text>
  <text start="159.22" dur="4.17">well for a very long time now the</text>
  <text start="161.59" dur="4.11">central bankers the deep state the</text>
  <text start="163.39" dur="4.95">corporate media they continually tried</text>
  <text start="165.7" dur="4.74">to blame this on the weather they tried</text>
  <text start="168.34" dur="4.32">to blame this on tax returns they try to</text>
  <text start="170.44" dur="3.9">blame it on everything but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="172.66" dur="3.39">running out of excuses because what</text>
  <text start="174.34" dur="6.15">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="176.05" dur="6.78">drop in a lot of the retail sector</text>
  <text start="180.49" dur="4.71">seeing building material dropping by</text>
  <text start="182.83" dur="4.62">negative 1 point 5 we see motor-vehicle</text>
  <text start="185.2" dur="6">and parts dropping by negative 1 point 2</text>
  <text start="187.45" dur="6.75">and for the parts negative 1 point 5 we</text>
  <text start="191.2" dur="6.24">see Sporting Goods down negative 0.8 and</text>
  <text start="194.2" dur="4.83">this is continually happening and this</text>
  <text start="197.44" dur="3.84">is why stores are closing this is why</text>
  <text start="199.03" dur="4.02">people are getting laid off and the drop</text>
  <text start="201.28" dur="3.69">in sales well this really shouldn&amp;#39;t be a</text>
  <text start="203.05" dur="4.38">total surprise because what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="204.97" dur="4.53">is that weekly earnings the average</text>
  <text start="207.43" dur="4.38">weekly earnings well they have now</text>
  <text start="209.5" dur="5.79">failed to rise for three straight months</text>
  <text start="211.81" dur="5.49">in a row and again this is showing us</text>
  <text start="215.29" dur="4.77">that things are rapidly falling apart</text>
  <text start="217.3" dur="6.15">now the thermometer for discretionary</text>
  <text start="220.06" dur="6.81">spending is restaurants people going out</text>
  <text start="223.45" dur="5.25">and dining out and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="226.87" dur="3.51">that the foot traffic at chain</text>
  <text start="228.7" dur="4.35">restaurants in March dropped three point</text>
  <text start="230.38" dur="5.04">four percent from a year ago menu prices</text>
  <text start="233.05" dur="5.07">well couldn&amp;#39;t be increased enough to</text>
  <text start="235.42" dur="5.58">make up for it and some store sales fell</text>
  <text start="238.12" dur="4.05">by 1.1 percent and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="241" dur="2.91">that people are saying you know</text>
  <text start="242.17" dur="3.66">something I don&amp;#39;t have a discretionary</text>
  <text start="243.91" dur="4.23">income I can&amp;#39;t go out to restaurants now</text>
  <text start="245.83" dur="4.47">in New York and New Jersey region their</text>
  <text start="248.14" dur="4.41">sales have plunged by four point six</text>
  <text start="250.3" dur="4.5">percent and foot truck traffic has</text>
  <text start="252.55" dur="4.74">dropped by six point three percent so</text>
  <text start="254.8" dur="3.689">the corporate media the deep state the</text>
  <text start="257.29" dur="3.3">central bankers they&amp;#39;re out there saying</text>
  <text start="258.489" dur="4.261">well the reason for this is because the</text>
  <text start="260.59" dur="5.36">people didn&amp;#39;t get their tax returns well</text>
  <text start="262.75" dur="5.22">that really isn&amp;#39;t true anymore either</text>
  <text start="265.95" dur="4.18">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="267.97" dur="6.06">that delayed in tax refunds from the IRS</text>
  <text start="270.13" dur="6.9">well the IRS now they&amp;#39;re almost up to</text>
  <text start="274.03" dur="5.19">date and the floodgates open and record</text>
  <text start="277.03" dur="4.59">amounts of tax refunds started pouring</text>
  <text start="279.22" dur="5.01">out so by the end of February the IRS</text>
  <text start="281.62" dur="4.47">was pretty much caught up so March with</text>
  <text start="284.23" dur="3.96">all this money from the tax returns</text>
  <text start="286.09" dur="5.73">March should be incredible</text>
  <text start="288.19" dur="6.48">guess what March sales they didn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="291.82" dur="5.58">anywhere they actually declined again</text>
  <text start="294.67" dur="4.41">what the corporate media what the deeps</text>
  <text start="297.4" dur="5.01">ate what the central banks are doing</text>
  <text start="299.08" dur="6.69">they&amp;#39;re feeding everyone with fake phony</text>
  <text start="302.41" dur="5.73">information and restaurants spending is</text>
  <text start="305.77" dur="5.13">a thermometer for discretionary spending</text>
  <text start="308.14" dur="6.029">which varies with how well consumers are</text>
  <text start="310.9" dur="5.489">doing and it&amp;#39;s the first to react</text>
  <text start="314.169" dur="4.321">when consumers hit their limits the</text>
  <text start="316.389" dur="4.441">first thing they cut our discretionary</text>
  <text start="318.49" dur="5.16">items such as eating out so this is</text>
  <text start="320.83" dur="6.089">another warning sign percolating up from</text>
  <text start="323.65" dur="4.919">beneath the surface and we know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="326.919" dur="3.481">going to be a lot more beneath the</text>
  <text start="328.569" dur="5.07">surface we saw already the Atlanta Fed</text>
  <text start="330.4" dur="6.269">they have slashed the first quarter GDP</text>
  <text start="333.639" dur="5.881">down to 0.5%</text>
  <text start="336.669" dur="5.31">I mean basically at zero and this is the</text>
  <text start="339.52" dur="3.269">manipulated number so what are we</text>
  <text start="341.979" dur="3.81">looking at here</text>
  <text start="342.789" dur="6.03">we are looking at a total collapse of</text>
  <text start="345.789" dur="5.641">the system now we need to look at what</text>
  <text start="348.819" dur="4.62">has been happening here when Trump first</text>
  <text start="351.43" dur="3.299">came into office he was campaigning</text>
  <text start="353.439" dur="2.88">telling everyone there&amp;#39;s bubbles</text>
  <text start="354.729" dur="3.84">everywhere the bubbles are getting ready</text>
  <text start="356.319" dur="5.22">to pop they&amp;#39;re everywhere when he was in</text>
  <text start="358.569" dur="5.13">office he said the economy was a mess</text>
  <text start="361.539" dur="4.47">and it was worse than he ever thought</text>
  <text start="363.699" dur="4.53">and he started to cut the budgets and</text>
  <text start="366.009" dur="4.891">try to trim everything tried to go down</text>
  <text start="368.229" dur="5.071">that route and it really didn&amp;#39;t work it</text>
  <text start="370.9" dur="4.65">just couldn&amp;#39;t work that way bringing</text>
  <text start="373.3" dur="4.589">back the jobs the manufacturing well</text>
  <text start="375.55" dur="5.789">that&amp;#39;s going to have to wait until this</text>
  <text start="377.889" dur="4.861">system comes down once the Fed signaled</text>
  <text start="381.339" dur="4.08">that they were raising rates in December</text>
  <text start="382.75" dur="4.5">and then again in February Trump</text>
  <text start="385.419" dur="4.081">realized that okay</text>
  <text start="387.25" dur="4.289">they have just signaled right now that</text>
  <text start="389.5" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re ready to bring down the economy</text>
  <text start="391.539" dur="6.09">the Fed also signaled that guess what</text>
  <text start="394.27" dur="6.329">they&amp;#39;re gonna ease back on stimulus all</text>
  <text start="397.629" dur="4.741">of this is showing us that they are</text>
  <text start="400.599" dur="5.34">prepared and ready to bring this economy</text>
  <text start="402.37" dur="5.849">down the $100 bill that was produced is</text>
  <text start="405.939" dur="4.26">split in half one side says Federal</text>
  <text start="408.219" dur="4.141">Reserve note the other says United</text>
  <text start="410.199" dur="4.111">States Treasury the one with the United</text>
  <text start="412.36" dur="4.979">States Treasury is gold says we the</text>
  <text start="414.31" dur="6.419">people we know there&amp;#39;s a transition</text>
  <text start="417.339" dur="5.61">coming we know it&amp;#39;s about to happen and</text>
  <text start="420.729" dur="5.011">the only way to have this happen right</text>
  <text start="422.949" dur="5.96">now is to get rid of the old system and</text>
  <text start="425.74" dur="7.139">this is what is about to happen the old</text>
  <text start="428.909" dur="5.831">system is about to disappear and is this</text>
  <text start="432.879" dur="4.65">going to be easy no it&amp;#39;s not going to be</text>
  <text start="434.74" dur="4.829">easy the central bank in their minds</text>
  <text start="437.529" dur="4.651">they&amp;#39;re like oh yeah we will show you</text>
  <text start="439.569" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;re gonna crash the system the good</text>
  <text start="442.18" dur="5.669">guys well they have different plans they</text>
  <text start="444.879" dur="5.85">have plans to usher in a brand</text>
  <text start="447.849" dur="6.421">new system most likely without the</text>
  <text start="450.729" dur="5.37">private central bank now again we have a</text>
  <text start="454.27" dur="3.599">battle going on here we need to</text>
  <text start="456.099" dur="4.8">understand that everything is not</text>
  <text start="457.869" dur="4.2">written in stone it&amp;#39;s not you know this</text>
  <text start="460.899" dur="2.97">is the way it&amp;#39;s going to be because we</text>
  <text start="462.069" dur="4.47">have two sides fighting for the same</text>
  <text start="463.869" dur="4.86">thing actually two different things one</text>
  <text start="466.539" dur="4.261">wants control of the people the other</text>
  <text start="468.729" dur="4.14">side wants the people to control their</text>
  <text start="470.8" dur="5.19">own lives and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="472.869" dur="6.03">right now and you need to be prepared to</text>
  <text start="475.99" dur="4.289">go through this transition period this</text>
  <text start="478.899" dur="3.6">is what we&amp;#39;ve been talking about for a</text>
  <text start="480.279" dur="4.61">very long time where we where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="482.499" dur="6.18">going to have this transition period of</text>
  <text start="484.889" dur="6.61">the entire system collapsing which means</text>
  <text start="488.679" dur="5.7">that most of this fiat currency is going</text>
  <text start="491.499" dur="4.32">to completely disappear things be the</text>
  <text start="494.379" dur="3.6">currency that you have in the bank</text>
  <text start="495.819" dur="4.41">accounts in your pension systems it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="497.979" dur="3.66">all going to disappear and the whole</text>
  <text start="500.229" dur="4.23">system is going to have to be</text>
  <text start="501.639" dur="5.13">regenerating now the deep state the</text>
  <text start="504.459" dur="5.401">central bankers what they like to do is</text>
  <text start="506.769" dur="5.731">they like to cover up this collapse make</text>
  <text start="509.86" dur="5.609">everyone forget about this collapse of</text>
  <text start="512.5" dur="5.939">course they do this by creating a war an</text>
  <text start="515.469" dur="5.401">event well the good guys they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="518.439" dur="6.39">this part they don&amp;#39;t want the cover-up</text>
  <text start="520.87" dur="6.209">they want the collapse and this is the</text>
  <text start="524.829" dur="3.81">only way to do it right now they tried</text>
  <text start="527.079" dur="3.901">the other way they tried going down the</text>
  <text start="528.639" dur="5.401">path trying to bring back jobs trying to</text>
  <text start="530.98" dur="3.479">cut the budget but everything is such a</text>
  <text start="534.04" dur="4.59">mess</text>
  <text start="534.459" dur="7.581">it is so corrupt it cannot be done this</text>
  <text start="538.63" dur="7.829">way and this is why tactics have shifted</text>
  <text start="542.04" dur="7.27">from pushing that agenda now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="546.459" dur="5.671">gonna let it just all come down and then</text>
  <text start="549.31" dur="5.219">there will be a fight of who is going to</text>
  <text start="552.13" dur="5.879">be in charge of the system and the good</text>
  <text start="554.529" dur="5.16">guys they are going to try to stop what</text>
  <text start="558.009" dur="3.901">the deep state what the central bank is</text>
  <text start="559.689" dur="5.311">trying to do and that is to cover up</text>
  <text start="561.91" dur="6.539">everything by having some type of an</text>
  <text start="565" dur="6.449">event or war so no matter what get</text>
