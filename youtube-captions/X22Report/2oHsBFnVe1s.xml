  <text start="333.04" dur="5.58">have the vote and we didn&amp;#39;t see any of</text>
  <text start="335.23" dur="6.24">this this is what the central bankers do</text>
  <text start="338.62" dur="4.89">this is what the non elected leaders to</text>
  <text start="341.47" dur="4.77">remember their non elected they put</text>
  <text start="343.51" dur="5.07">themselves in this position they created</text>
  <text start="346.24" dur="6.48">this out of thin air and put themselves</text>
  <text start="348.58" dur="7.98">in this position they&amp;#39;re using this to</text>
  <text start="352.72" dur="6.93">scare the people of the UK now remember</text>
  <text start="356.56" dur="6.54">what happens when the UK leaves other</text>
  <text start="359.65" dur="5.88">countries within the EU they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="363.1" dur="7.41">going to look at this and say why are we</text>
  <text start="365.53" dur="7.08">with the EU now maybe once the e the UK</text>
  <text start="370.51" dur="6.05">leaves the EU they might have to</text>
  <text start="372.61" dur="6.66">struggle a little bit but guess what</text>
  <text start="376.56" dur="5.29">everything will turn around do I think</text>
  <text start="379.27" dur="7.14">that they&amp;#39;ll have riots shortages</text>
  <text start="381.85" dur="6.26">blackouts they won&amp;#39;t have fuel no things</text>
  <text start="386.41" dur="5.15">will be a little tough in the beginning</text>
  <text start="388.11" dur="7.75">but as the trade deals come online and</text>
  <text start="391.56" dur="8.17">once they start trading the UK is going</text>
  <text start="395.86" dur="7.47">to prosper this is what the central bank</text>
  <text start="399.73" dur="7.29">is worried about they don&amp;#39;t want any</text>
  <text start="403.33" dur="7.85">country prospering without them without</text>
  <text start="407.02" dur="6.6">the EU in control and the UK does well</text>
  <text start="411.18" dur="6.01">this will spread to other countries</text>
  <text start="413.62" dur="7.59">Italy is sitting there waiting to see</text>
  <text start="417.19" dur="6.07">what happens other countries are also</text>
  <text start="421.21" dur="6.46">waiting</text>
  <text start="423.26" dur="6.48">this is a defining moment this is a</text>
  <text start="427.67" dur="5.31">point in time where the people are</text>
  <text start="429.74" dur="7.86">finally going to speak out and tell the</text>
  <text start="432.98" dur="6.39">central bankers where to go and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="437.6" dur="4.23">just happening out in the UK and</text>
  <text start="439.37" dur="4.1">throughout Europe it is happening here</text>
  <text start="441.83" dur="4.95">in the United States</text>
  <text start="443.47" dur="6.7">remember the central bank here in the</text>
  <text start="446.78" dur="5.88">United States they don&amp;#39;t like to be in</text>
  <text start="450.17" dur="3.83">the spotlight they like to be hidden in</text>
  <text start="452.66" dur="5.34">the shadows</text>
  <text start="454" dur="7.6">everything was stricken from elementary</text>
  <text start="458" dur="6.72">school high school and throughout</text>
  <text start="461.6" dur="4.83">college you&amp;#39;re really not learning about</text>
  <text start="464.72" dur="2.58">the Federal Reserve many people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="466.43" dur="6.11">even know what the Federal Reserve is</text>
  <text start="467.3" dur="8.4">and this is why Trump was out there</text>
  <text start="472.54" dur="5.11">since the beginning talking about the</text>
  <text start="475.7" dur="4.68">Federal Reserve contradicting the</text>
  <text start="477.65" dur="5.91">Federal Reserve putting the spotlight on</text>
  <text start="480.38" dur="6.51">the Federal Reserve what you see</text>
  <text start="483.56" dur="4.86">happening in the UK Europe and many</text>
  <text start="486.89" dur="5.34">other places and here in the United</text>
  <text start="488.42" dur="7.38">States it&amp;#39;s all being done on purpose to</text>
  <text start="492.23" dur="7.5">bring attention to these non elected</text>
  <text start="495.8" dur="7.26">individuals who control our economic</text>
  <text start="499.73" dur="6.3">system they have no allegiance to a</text>
  <text start="503.06" dur="5.61">people they have no allegiance to a</text>
  <text start="506.03" dur="3.86">country their allegiance is to</text>
  <text start="508.67" dur="4.86">themselves</text>
  <text start="509.89" dur="4.959">remember what Q has told us the Federal</text>
  <text start="513.53" dur="5.67">Reserve and other central banks around</text>
  <text start="514.849" dur="10.201">the world they&amp;#39;re above the laws of that</text>
  <text start="519.2" dur="8.48">country they sit on private land the</text>
  <text start="525.05" dur="5.91">government can can&amp;#39;t really touch them</text>
  <text start="527.68" dur="5.53">here in the United States just to have</text>
  <text start="530.96" dur="6.54">an audit of this private corporation</text>
  <text start="533.21" dur="7.14">that runs the entire economic system</text>
  <text start="537.5" dur="6.9">here in the United States Congress has</text>
  <text start="540.35" dur="6.18">to pass a bill it has to pass in the</text>
  <text start="544.4" dur="5.91">house in the Senate and go to the</text>
  <text start="546.53" dur="6.87">President to allow the people to audit</text>
  <text start="550.31" dur="6.17">the Fed think about that for a second</text>
  <text start="553.4" dur="6.24">it was designed purposely this way</text>
  <text start="556.48" dur="5.76">because the Federal Reserve a central</text>
  <text start="559.64" dur="5.49">bank they knew if they could corrupt</text>
  <text start="562.24" dur="3.46">many individuals within the House and</text>
  <text start="565.13" dur="4.74">the Senate</text>
  <text start="565.7" dur="5.15">these bills would go nowhere if they</text>
  <text start="569.87" dur="5.13">could pay them off</text>
  <text start="570.85" dur="7.99">keep them earning tons and tons of</text>
  <text start="575" dur="7.7">currency make them very wealthy they</text>
  <text start="578.84" dur="7.05">would never pass any of these bills and</text>
  <text start="582.7" dur="3.9">this has been going on for a very long</text>
  <text start="585.89" dur="4.38">time</text>
  <text start="586.6" dur="7.99">now things are changing and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="590.27" dur="8.52">changing very very quickly this is why</text>
  <text start="594.59" dur="6.02">the Patriots are getting everyone ready</text>
  <text start="598.79" dur="4.59">for what is coming</text>
  <text start="600.61" dur="5.35">remember it&amp;#39;s done in stages it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="603.38" dur="4.65">like the income tax when the central</text>
  <text start="605.96" dur="5.73">bank came into existence and they said</text>
  <text start="608.03" dur="5.82">hey listen by the way we&amp;#39;re only gonna</text>
  <text start="611.69" dur="4.11">tax the wealthy and then a couple years</text>
  <text start="613.85" dur="4.17">later they waited and they said you know</text>
  <text start="615.8" dur="4.44">what things are getting bad we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="618.02" dur="4.02">have to tax the upper middle class wait</text>
  <text start="620.24" dur="4.08">a couple years you know what we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="622.04" dur="3.96">have to tax the middle class wait a</text>
  <text start="624.32" dur="3.24">couple more years you know what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="626" dur="4.62">gonna have to tax the poor and if you</text>
  <text start="627.56" dur="5.16">you notice they do it very very slowly</text>
  <text start="630.62" dur="5.07">over a period of time so nobody catches</text>
  <text start="632.72" dur="6.87">on while they&amp;#39;re doing this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="635.69" dur="5.94">removing all different accounts of the</text>
  <text start="639.59" dur="5.07">Federal Reserve and how the founding</text>
  <text start="641.63" dur="5.7">fathers never wanted a private western</text>
  <text start="644.66" dur="7.14">central bank they removed this from all</text>
  <text start="647.33" dur="6.3">the books in school never to be found</text>
  <text start="651.8" dur="4.08">yes you might get a little passage here</text>
  <text start="653.63" dur="4.41">and there but they did this on purpose</text>
  <text start="655.88" dur="4.35">because they didn&amp;#39;t want the people to</text>
  <text start="658.04" dur="7.59">know what the Federal Reserve actually</text>
  <text start="660.23" dur="8.1">was well it&amp;#39;s the same thing Trump is</text>
  <text start="665.63" dur="4.92">doing this very very slowly</text>
  <text start="668.33" dur="3.81">of course he has to do it at an</text>
  <text start="670.55" dur="4.08">accelerated rate we don&amp;#39;t have that much</text>
  <text start="672.14" dur="7.26">time we don&amp;#39;t have years and years and</text>
  <text start="674.63" dur="7.71">years so every moment every couple of</text>
  <text start="679.4" dur="5.28">months or weeks he&amp;#39;s out there telling</text>
  <text start="682.34" dur="3.36">the people well the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="684.68" dur="2.54">doesn&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re doing if the</text>
  <text start="685.7" dur="2.509">Federal Reserve would do this we were</text>
  <text start="687.22" dur="2.549">doing a lot better if the Federal</text>
  <text start="688.209" dur="2.94">Reserve was doing that the companies</text>
  <text start="689.769" dur="3.961">would be doing a lot better remember</text>
  <text start="691.149" dur="4.05">we&amp;#39;re competing with different countries</text>
  <text start="693.73" dur="4.62">around the world and that the Federal</text>
  <text start="695.199" dur="6.33">Reserve did this we be better off he</text>
  <text start="698.35" dur="4.95">continually does this on purpose he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="701.529" dur="5.1">trying to get the people up to speed</text>
  <text start="703.3" dur="5.82">very very quickly because before you</text>
  <text start="706.629" dur="5.64">know it that time is going to be here</text>
  <text start="709.12" dur="6.089">when he&amp;#39;s going to go after the Federal</text>
  <text start="712.269" dur="4.291">Reserve and that time is coming very</text>
  <text start="715.209" dur="3.99">very quickly think about it</text>
  <text start="716.56" dur="6.779">we&amp;#39;re in 2019 the middle of 2019 right</text>
  <text start="719.199" dur="6.12">now next year is the elections once he</text>
  <text start="723.339" dur="2.85">wins the elections there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="725.319" dur="2.58">holding him back</text>
  <text start="726.189" dur="4.82">there&amp;#39;s nothing holding the Patriots</text>
  <text start="727.899" dur="6.42">back they&amp;#39;re gonna be going at an</text>
  <text start="731.009" dur="7.051">accelerated rate and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
