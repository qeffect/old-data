  <text start="58.32" dur="6.839">episode 1699 a.n today&amp;#39;s date is October</text>
  <text start="61.949" dur="7.261">25th 2018 and thus out of the episode is</text>
  <text start="65.159" dur="6.99">that time is now warnings confirmations</text>
  <text start="69.21" dur="5.73">prepare let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="72.149" dur="5.341">collapse financial news now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="74.94" dur="3.99">seeing many different indicators showing</text>
  <text start="77.49" dur="3.06">us that the economy has been falling</text>
  <text start="78.93" dur="2.969">apart and I&amp;#39;m not just saying we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="80.55" dur="2.819">seeing the indicator just in the last</text>
  <text start="81.899" dur="5.58">couple of months we&amp;#39;ve been watching</text>
  <text start="83.369" dur="6.121">this entire economy be built up with a</text>
  <text start="87.479" dur="3.991">gigantic illusion by manipulating the</text>
  <text start="89.49" dur="4.11">statistical numbers why we look behind</text>
  <text start="91.47" dur="5.64">the scenes showing that this economy is</text>
  <text start="93.6" dur="6.6">not real we seen Trump manipulate the</text>
  <text start="97.11" dur="5.039">statistical information even more and we</text>
  <text start="100.2" dur="4.11">said nope this is not true either</text>
  <text start="102.149" dur="4.771">we showed why he was doing this this was</text>
  <text start="104.31" dur="4.83">a specific purpose we said that he would</text>
  <text start="106.92" dur="4.589">contradict the Fed and he continually</text>
  <text start="109.14" dur="4.56">does this actually he says the Fed if</text>
  <text start="111.509" dur="5.28">they continually raise rates they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="113.7" dur="5.699">going to wreck the economy we already</text>
  <text start="116.789" dur="4.021">know that if the Fed continually raises</text>
  <text start="119.399" dur="3.09">rates because we&amp;#39;ve been tracking this</text>
  <text start="120.81" dur="3.96">throughout history every time the Fed</text>
  <text start="122.489" dur="4.921">raises their rates the economy falls</text>
  <text start="124.77" dur="5.79">apart we already know that the economy</text>
  <text start="127.41" dur="5.73">is going to fall apart sometime in the</text>
  <text start="130.56" dur="4.649">middle of 2019 that doesn&amp;#39;t mean it</text>
  <text start="133.14" dur="3.9">implodes at that time that means they</text>
  <text start="135.209" dur="3.571">hit the point that neutral point of</text>
  <text start="137.04" dur="4.44">interest rates where everything just</text>
  <text start="138.78" dur="5.67">starts to collapse and it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="141.48" dur="5.46">an avalanche where you hear the boom and</text>
  <text start="144.45" dur="5.039">you see up top a little dust from the</text>
  <text start="146.94" dur="5.34">snow and it builds as it comes down the</text>
  <text start="149.489" dur="5.491">hill or the mountain and before you know</text>
  <text start="152.28" dur="6">it it&amp;#39;s gigantic well in the middle of</text>
  <text start="154.98" dur="5.49">2019 when they hit that neutral point of</text>
  <text start="158.28" dur="5.459">interest rates that&amp;#39;s the little smoke</text>
  <text start="160.47" dur="4.86">on the top of the mountain and every</text>
  <text start="163.739" dur="4.171">month after that you&amp;#39;re gonna see it</text>
  <text start="165.33" dur="7.4">build and build and build just like we</text>
  <text start="167.91" dur="7.17">saw back in 2008 we saw that the</text>
  <text start="172.73" dur="5.35">interest rates hit a certain point in</text>
  <text start="175.08" dur="5.61">2006 going into 2007 they started to</text>
  <text start="178.08" dur="5.31">drop them rapidly but it already began</text>
  <text start="180.69" dur="6.01">the Avalanche started to come down and</text>
  <text start="183.39" dur="5.95">it took about a year or so after that</text>
  <text start="186.7" dur="3.3">as we approached it behind-the-scenes if</text>
  <text start="189.34" dur="2.16">you didn&amp;#39;t look at the stock market</text>
  <text start="190" dur="3.12">didn&amp;#39;t look at the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="191.5" dur="4.23">you didn&amp;#39;t look at the GDP numbers and</text>
  <text start="193.12" dur="5.1">everything else you saw businesses start</text>
  <text start="195.73" dur="5.66">to layoff people you saw companies start</text>
  <text start="198.22" dur="6.66">to have problems we&amp;#39;re seeing this</text>
  <text start="201.39" dur="7.3">almost exactly in the same way except</text>
  <text start="204.88" dur="6.359">it&amp;#39;s much much worse before the interest</text>
  <text start="208.69" dur="3.12">rates were even raised before anything</text>
  <text start="211.239" dur="4.021">happened</text>
  <text start="211.81" dur="5.28">we saw retail fall apart before the</text>
  <text start="215.26" dur="5.66">interest rates went up we talked about</text>
  <text start="217.09" dur="7.56">real estate and how sales were slowing</text>
  <text start="220.92" dur="6.909">before the stock market came down before</text>
  <text start="224.65" dur="5.309">anything happened we were showing how</text>
  <text start="227.829" dur="5.22">everything has been falling apart and</text>
  <text start="229.959" dur="6.181">now it&amp;#39;s just accelerating and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="233.049" dur="5.641">going to get worse this is why a very</text>
  <text start="236.14" dur="4.2">long time ago we said prepare for those</text>
  <text start="238.69" dur="3.829">people have been rotating their goods</text>
  <text start="240.34" dur="4.44">out for those people that have been</text>
  <text start="242.519" dur="3.791">purchasing you know food from like</text>
  <text start="244.78" dur="3.72">Costco or Sam&amp;#39;s or wherever you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="246.31" dur="4.709">getting PJ BJ&amp;#39;s wherever you&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="248.5" dur="3.78">it it doesn&amp;#39;t make a difference even if</text>
  <text start="251.019" dur="4.021">you&amp;#39;re getting it from a supermarket as</text>
  <text start="252.28" dur="6.42">long as you&amp;#39;re continually stocking up</text>
  <text start="255.04" dur="5.58">as long as you&amp;#39;re purchasing or swapping</text>
  <text start="258.7" dur="4.2">your paper money for gold or silver as</text>
  <text start="260.62" dur="4.98">long as you have Kryptos as long as you</text>
  <text start="262.9" dur="7.2">have something because as we know when</text>
  <text start="265.6" dur="7.129">this system falls apart implodes the</text>
  <text start="270.1" dur="5.7">dollar is not going to be worth anything</text>
  <text start="272.729" dur="6.551">they will be moving to a different</text>
  <text start="275.8" dur="5.07">system and we know the pensions most</text>
  <text start="279.28" dur="3.139">likely they&amp;#39;re not going to be there the</text>
  <text start="280.87" dur="4.47">amount of debt that we have is</text>
  <text start="282.419" dur="5.321">astronomical and those still in the</text>
  <text start="285.34" dur="4.65">central bank that love the central bank</text>
  <text start="287.74" dur="4.56">they manipulated the FICO scores now</text>
  <text start="289.99" dur="4.95">this started a while ago but you can see</text>
  <text start="292.3" dur="4.5">how they have to keep everyone in debt</text>
  <text start="294.94" dur="4.409">and they need everyone to take out even</text>
  <text start="296.8" dur="4.739">more debt and this was planned quite a</text>
  <text start="299.349" dur="3.421">while ago because they knew that there</text>
  <text start="301.539" dur="2.911">was going to be a certain point where</text>
  <text start="302.77" dur="2.94">they were going to have to change things</text>
  <text start="304.45" dur="3.6">to keep the system going a little bit</text>
  <text start="305.71" dur="6">longer and they were also expecting an</text>
  <text start="308.05" dur="5.91">event at this point they thought we were</text>
  <text start="311.71" dur="4.709">going to be in the beginning stages most</text>
  <text start="313.96" dur="4.8">likely of a war this way they can say</text>
  <text start="316.419" dur="3.701">well the reason why the economy is</text>
  <text start="318.76" dur="2.62">falling apart is</text>
  <text start="320.12" dur="2.94">because we&amp;#39;re in this war everyone has</text>
  <text start="321.38" dur="4.5">to tighten their belt but we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="323.06" dur="4.65">seeing this so they can&amp;#39;t use that story</text>
  <text start="325.88" dur="5.97">right now and they&amp;#39;re trying to figure</text>
  <text start="327.71" dur="6.03">our way out of this now out in the UK we</text>
  <text start="331.85" dur="4.26">see the brexit talks they&amp;#39;re on hold</text>
  <text start="333.74" dur="5.899">right now they can&amp;#39;t agree on anything</text>
  <text start="336.11" dur="7.41">the central bankers will never agree on</text>
  <text start="339.639" dur="6.551">allowing the UK to leave here in the</text>
  <text start="343.52" dur="5.31">United States this is how bad it has</text>
  <text start="346.19" dur="4.789">gotten here in the United States more</text>
  <text start="348.83" dur="5.13">than half of Americans receive money</text>
  <text start="350.979" dur="5.201">more money in various types of</text>
  <text start="353.96" dur="3.84">governmental transfer payments Medicare</text>
  <text start="356.18" dur="4.769">Medicaid food stamps Social Security</text>
  <text start="357.8" dur="6.33">then they pay in federal taxes now</text>
  <text start="360.949" dur="6.931">remember this is not each and every</text>
  <text start="364.13" dur="5.48">person&amp;#39;s fault it&amp;#39;s not your fault that</text>
  <text start="367.88" dur="4.77">you&amp;#39;re in the position that you&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="369.61" dur="6.04">the central banking system is not</text>
  <text start="372.65" dur="4.98">designed to make everyone prosperous and</text>
  <text start="375.65" dur="4.829">I know yes there are certain people that</text>
  <text start="377.63" dur="5.159">made out you know within the central</text>
  <text start="380.479" dur="4.321">banking system they were insiders that</text>
  <text start="382.789" dur="4.44">always make out within the central bank</text>
  <text start="384.8" dur="4.92">system those people those individuals</text>
  <text start="387.229" dur="5.31">that started out in the 70s when the</text>
  <text start="389.72" dur="4.53">system just came online well those</text>
  <text start="392.539" dur="3.75">people had a better chance most of those</text>
  <text start="394.25" dur="4.05">people made out really really well</text>
  <text start="396.289" dur="4.141">during that time frame because there</text>
  <text start="398.3" dur="3.869">wasn&amp;#39;t that much debt the system was in</text>
  <text start="400.43" dur="4.26">the beginning stages there was a huge</text>
  <text start="402.169" dur="5.341">amount of inflation but as we went along</text>
  <text start="404.69" dur="7.62">and you enter the end stage of the</text>
  <text start="407.51" dur="7.529">system those people in the 2000s 2008</text>
  <text start="412.31" dur="4.05">2009 10 11 where they reached the age</text>
  <text start="415.039" dur="3.091">where they&amp;#39;re gonna go out and work</text>
  <text start="416.36" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re coming out of college these</text>
  <text start="418.13" dur="6.42">people they&amp;#39;re struggling and the system</text>
  <text start="421.22" dur="5.46">is not designed to continue on forever</text>
  <text start="424.55" dur="5.369">like this this is why they have to keep</text>
  <text start="426.68" dur="5.34">resetting it but what the central banks</text>
  <text start="429.919" dur="4.201">and the deep state have done is they</text>
  <text start="432.02" dur="4.709">wanted everyone enslaved and dependent</text>
  <text start="434.12" dur="4.669">on the government because as you borrow</text>
  <text start="436.729" dur="5.94">more money the value of the dollar</text>
  <text start="438.789" dur="5.44">decreases jobs dry up and especially</text>
  <text start="442.669" dur="3.391">they were doing this on purpose remember</text>
  <text start="444.229" dur="4.231">they&amp;#39;re shipping all the manufacturing</text>
  <text start="446.06" dur="4.919">everything out of this country so to</text>
  <text start="448.46" dur="3.87">keep everyone from writing what do you</text>
  <text start="450.979" dur="2.791">have to do you</text>
  <text start="452.33" dur="4.5">have to put them on government support</text>
  <text start="453.77" dur="5.429">how do you keep government running well</text>
  <text start="456.83" dur="5.489">you have to borrow more from the Fed so</text>
  <text start="459.199" dur="5.97">this system was designed to enslave</text>
  <text start="462.319" dur="4.38">everyone so when you look at these</text>
  <text start="465.169" dur="3.18">things like this report that came out</text>
  <text start="466.699" dur="4.44">from the Congressional Budget Office</text>
  <text start="468.349" dur="6.12">it&amp;#39;s showing you that people are</text>
  <text start="471.139" dur="5.791">dependent on the system and they take in</text>
  <text start="474.469" dur="5.19">a lot more than they&amp;#39;re putting out now</text>
  <text start="476.93" dur="4.47">remember the taxing of the people was</text>
  <text start="479.659" dur="4.111">put into place because of the central</text>
  <text start="481.4" dur="5.25">bank&amp;#39;s system so this goes in</text>
  <text start="483.77" dur="5.04">hand-in-hand but the whole point of this</text>
  <text start="486.65" dur="4.56">is that they wanted everyone enslaved in</text>
  <text start="488.81" dur="5.37">the system and now it&amp;#39;s time to get out</text>
  <text start="491.21" dur="5.609">of this system when we start to look at</text>
  <text start="494.18" dur="4.019">different economic indicators here in</text>
  <text start="496.819" dur="4.201">the United States we talk about housing</text>
  <text start="498.199" dur="3.991">quite a bit pending home sales now they</text>
  <text start="501.02" dur="3.359">have slumped for the fifth straight</text>
  <text start="502.19" dur="4.289">month in a row so we have existing home</text>
  <text start="504.379" dur="4.44">sales new home sales and remember we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="506.479" dur="5.101">coming out of the spring and summer</text>
  <text start="508.819" dur="4.291">months we are now in October gonna be</text>
  <text start="511.58" dur="4.829">entering November very very soon and</text>
  <text start="513.11" dur="5.549">what do we see we see real estate if we</text>
  <text start="516.409" dur="4.29">go back in time it is done terribly</text>
  <text start="518.659" dur="3.901">during the summer seasons and this is</text>
  <text start="520.699" dur="4.591">supposed to be the best time of year for</text>
  <text start="522.56" dur="5">real estate pending home sales dropped</text>
  <text start="525.29" dur="4.979">three point four percent year-on-year</text>
  <text start="527.56" dur="6.639">this is the tenth annual decline in the</text>
  <text start="530.269" dur="8.07">last 11 months so what are we seeing</text>
  <text start="534.199" dur="7.291">here we&amp;#39;re seeing the entire system fall</text>
  <text start="538.339" dur="6.12">apart as the Fed continually raised</text>
  <text start="541.49" dur="5.31">rates people gonna be pushed out of the</text>
  <text start="544.459" dur="4.681">real estate market the real estate</text>
  <text start="546.8" dur="4.83">markets gonna start to fall and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="549.14" dur="4.139">gonna be just like that avalanche now of</text>
  <text start="551.63" dur="4.17">course we have Lawrence young we talked</text>
  <text start="553.279" dur="3.781">about him many many times he&amp;#39;s the chief</text>
  <text start="555.8" dur="4.32">economist for the National Association</text>
  <text start="557.06" dur="5.279">of Realtors during the period of 2008</text>
  <text start="560.12" dur="5.219">Lawrence Yun said that during that</text>
  <text start="562.339" dur="4.11">winter of 2008 real estate was gonna pop</text>
  <text start="565.339" dur="3.601">back up and it was gonna do fantastic</text>
  <text start="566.449" dur="5.58">actually got worse and he was completely</text>
  <text start="568.94" dur="6.03">off so what is lawrence yun saying now</text>
  <text start="572.029" dur="4.711">he&amp;#39;s saying that buyers are now on the</text>
  <text start="574.97" dur="4.679">sidelines they&amp;#39;re waiting to jump in</text>
  <text start="576.74" dur="5.43">once more inventory becomes available</text>
  <text start="579.649" dur="5.011">and the price is right while inventory</text>
  <text start="582.17" dur="3.81">is rising right now so there&amp;#39;s plenty of</text>
  <text start="584.66" dur="4.56">homes out there</text>
  <text start="585.98" dur="6">I mean if you just take an over look an</text>
  <text start="589.22" dur="5.13">overview of any city with Zillow there</text>
  <text start="591.98" dur="4.74">are so many homes available right now</text>
  <text start="594.35" dur="4.8">and prices are coming down but the</text>
  <text start="596.72" dur="4.41">problem is as rates continually move up</text>
  <text start="599.15" dur="4.92">the prices aren&amp;#39;t coming down fast</text>
  <text start="601.13" dur="7.05">enough they will start to come down fast</text>
  <text start="604.07" dur="6.63">enough when the rates continually move</text>
  <text start="608.18" dur="5.43">up and people can&amp;#39;t sell their homes now</text>
  <text start="610.7" dur="4.86">we saw this back in 2007-2008 the</text>
  <text start="613.61" dur="3.48">problem is is every time the interest</text>
  <text start="615.56" dur="3.96">rates go up and the prices come down a</text>
  <text start="617.09" dur="4.14">little bit people are pushed out of the</text>
  <text start="619.52" dur="4.08">market because it&amp;#39;s not a one-to-one</text>
  <text start="621.23" dur="6">ratio here and this is what happened</text>
  <text start="623.6" dur="5.85">back in 2008 and we&amp;#39;re gonna see the</text>
  <text start="627.23" dur="3.51">same thing happen here and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="629.45" dur="4.65">be much much worse because we have to</text>
  <text start="630.74" dur="5.31">remember the Fed created these bubbles</text>
  <text start="634.1" dur="3.6">the housing market was a gigantic</text>
  <text start="636.05" dur="4.08">illusion they were hoping that people</text>
  <text start="637.7" dur="5.67">saw equity in their house and they would</text>
  <text start="640.13" dur="5.34">use this equity and use it out in retail</text>
  <text start="643.37" dur="5.57">it didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="645.47" dur="6.21">we also see core durable goods they</text>
  <text start="648.94" dur="7.3">haven&amp;#39;t really gone anywhere actually</text>
  <text start="651.68" dur="7.41">they are stagnant right now now Cordoba</text>
  <text start="656.24" dur="4.86">goods are made up of transports washers</text>
  <text start="659.09" dur="4.38">dryers and things like that if you</text>
  <text start="661.1" dur="3.78">remove the transports and this is like</text>
  <text start="663.47" dur="4.98">military aircraft and things like that</text>
  <text start="664.88" dur="5.58">you can see that the durable goods of</text>
  <text start="668.45" dur="5.09">washers dryers things that people use it</text>
  <text start="670.46" dur="6.99">is gone absolutely nowhere</text>
  <text start="673.54" dur="6.22">now we also see the ECB they are saying</text>
  <text start="677.45" dur="5.04">that they&amp;#39;re gonna end QE in December</text>
  <text start="679.76" dur="5.43">but they&amp;#39;re not gonna change their rates</text>
  <text start="682.49" dur="5.16">so they&amp;#39;re gonna they&amp;#39;re gonna end their</text>
  <text start="685.19" dur="6.66">stimulus but they&amp;#39;re gonna keep their</text>
  <text start="687.65" dur="6.15">rates at zero pretty much the same their</text>
  <text start="691.85" dur="5.13">marginal lending facility around 0.25</text>
  <text start="693.8" dur="7.17">percent deposit facility at negative</text>
  <text start="696.98" dur="6.42">point 4 zero percent so they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="700.97" dur="3.78">gonna slow the stimulus but they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="703.4" dur="4.02">moving the rates I wonder why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="704.75" dur="4.89">not moving the rates and why the Fed is</text>
  <text start="707.42" dur="4.98">raising the rates so quickly because we</text>
  <text start="709.64" dur="5.25">know most likely Powell is working with</text>
  <text start="712.4" dur="4.95">Trump trumpet Powell into this position</text>
  <text start="714.89" dur="5.07">he&amp;#39;s been out there saying that Powell</text>
  <text start="717.35" dur="4.95">is raising rates it&amp;#39;s a really bad time</text>
  <text start="719.96" dur="4.37">like him but I&amp;#39;m not gonna fire him hmm</text>
  <text start="722.3" dur="5.46">sounds like what he said about sessions</text>
  <text start="724.33" dur="7.3">so what we&amp;#39;re watching right now is the</text>
  <text start="727.76" dur="7.02">Fed with Trump working together they are</text>
  <text start="731.63" dur="4.98">bringing down the system the ECB they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="734.78" dur="4.2">not raising rates because they know if</text>
  <text start="736.61" dur="5.37">they raise rates right now they are</text>
  <text start="738.98" dur="4.5">going to be blamed for the European</text>
  <text start="741.98" dur="3.45">economy falling apart in many of these</text>
  <text start="743.48" dur="4.38">European countries they are in a huge</text>
  <text start="745.43" dur="6.99">amount of debt now Peter Schiff was out</text>
  <text start="747.86" dur="8.22">there and he is sending up a red flare</text>
  <text start="752.42" dur="6.09">letting everyone know that the standard</text>
  <text start="756.08" dur="4.92">of living is going to be the biggest</text>
  <text start="758.51" dur="4.92">casualty in America and we know this</text>
  <text start="761" dur="3.75">because we know once the dollar starts</text>
  <text start="763.43" dur="2.43">to fall apart and remember a lot of</text>
  <text start="764.75" dur="2.97">people talk about the dollar and say</text>
  <text start="765.86" dur="3.54">well no it&amp;#39;s still strong the dollar</text>
  <text start="767.72" dur="5.13">still good a lot of countries still use</text>
  <text start="769.4" dur="5.91">it but once the economy starts to fall</text>
  <text start="772.85" dur="5.01">apart and country lue countries lose</text>
  <text start="775.31" dur="6">faith see this is the problem here the</text>
  <text start="777.86" dur="5.19">dollars not backed by anything and once</text>

  <text start="783.05" dur="6.51">sell their oil using other currencies</text>
  <text start="785.36" dur="7.17">the dollar is just sitting there and the</text>
  <text start="789.56" dur="5.46">only thing that&amp;#39;s backing it is the full</text>
  <text start="792.53" dur="5.01">credit and faith of the US government</text>
  <text start="795.02" dur="5.94">well the US government&amp;#39;s in a huge</text>
  <text start="797.54" dur="5.7">amount of debt and countries around the</text>
  <text start="800.96" dur="4.89">world they&amp;#39;re not going to have faith in</text>
  <text start="803.24" dur="4.53">the dollar a lot of countries are</text>
  <text start="805.85" dur="4.02">looking to move away from the style</text>
  <text start="807.77" dur="4.32">remember and this is not the US dollar</text>
  <text start="809.87" dur="3.96">of the people this is a central bank</text>
  <text start="812.09" dur="4.8">note this is a Federal Reserve Note</text>
  <text start="813.83" dur="7.17">they&amp;#39;re the ones who created we owe</text>
  <text start="816.89" dur="8.16">everything back to them because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="821" dur="6.48">actually loaning us the currency so</text>
  <text start="825.05" dur="4.92">Peter Schiff is out there saying when</text>
  <text start="827.48" dur="5.82">this starts to fall apart people are</text>
  <text start="829.97" dur="6.54">going to have a very difficult time he</text>
  <text start="833.3" dur="5.91">said what you got to do is to get out of</text>
  <text start="836.51" dur="4.53">US dollar assets the dollar is going to</text>
  <text start="839.21" dur="4.53">be the biggest casualty along with the</text>
  <text start="841.04" dur="4.77">American standard of living he said</text>
  <text start="843.74" dur="4.08">adding that foreign stock markets</text>
  <text start="845.81" dur="4.26">especially emerging markets currently</text>
  <text start="847.82" dur="4.5">depressed by the strong dollar would see</text>
  <text start="850.07" dur="3.26">a strong rise they&amp;#39;re going to see a</text>
  <text start="852.32" dur="5.57">boom</text>
  <text start="853.33" dur="6.3">when the dollar weakens and when the</text>
  <text start="857.89" dur="4.61">dollar starts to fall apart</text>
  <text start="859.63" dur="4.95">that means credits gonna fall apart</text>
  <text start="862.5" dur="5.98">deliveries the stores is gonna fall</text>
  <text start="864.58" dur="4.53">apart and we&amp;#39;re going to see a gigantic</text>
  <text start="868.48" dur="3.75">mess</text>
  <text start="869.11" dur="5.01">now in the meantime we know that Trump</text>
  <text start="872.23" dur="4.859">the Patriots they&amp;#39;ve been working on a</text>
  <text start="874.12" dur="4.469">transition plan and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="877.089" dur="3.301">bring back manufacturing trying to make</text>
  <text start="878.589" dur="4.201">this as easy as possible but it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="880.39" dur="3.9">difficult when you&amp;#39;re getting out of a</text>
  <text start="882.79" dur="3.39">central bank system and remember it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="884.29" dur="4.02">not just going to be the u.s. it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="886.18" dur="3.99">to be many other countries that are</text>
  <text start="888.31" dur="4.5">gonna be going through this as well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="890.17" dur="5.789">gonna be global just like we saw the</text>
  <text start="892.81" dur="4.68">Great Depression it was global and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="895.959" dur="4.201">gonna see the same thing happen once</text>
  <text start="897.49" dur="5.849">again and as we go through this time</text>
  <text start="900.16" dur="5.13">period we might see rolling blackouts we</text>
  <text start="903.339" dur="5.881">might see problems I mean think about</text>
  <text start="905.29" dur="5.549">the 70s with the UK when we were coming</text>
  <text start="909.22" dur="4.38">off the gold standard and we&amp;#39;re going on</text>
  <text start="910.839" dur="4.981">to the petrodollar system yes we saw</text>
  <text start="913.6" dur="4.35">problems here like gas shortages but out</text>
  <text start="915.82" dur="5.49">in the UK in other countries they were</text>
  <text start="917.95" dur="5.22">having major major problems and we might</text>
  <text start="921.31" dur="4.17">see the same thing here because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="923.17" dur="5.159">going to be losing the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="925.48" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;re gonna be losing what we have today</text>
  <text start="928.329" dur="3.45">what was set up by the central bank</text>
  <text start="930.13" dur="4.079">moving into a completely different</text>
  <text start="931.779" dur="4.651">system I mean once we move into the new</text>
  <text start="934.209" dur="4.711">system it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot easier for</text>
  <text start="936.43" dur="5.219">people because it&amp;#39;s going to be backed</text>
  <text start="938.92" dur="4.919">by something it&amp;#39;s gonna have checks and</text>
  <text start="941.649" dur="4.111">balances the government just won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="943.839" dur="4.171">able to print as much as they want</text>
  <text start="945.76" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re gonna have to write off most of</text>
  <text start="948.01" dur="5.37">this debt and maybe if they show and I</text>
  <text start="951.07" dur="4.59">think this is maybe the plan if they do</text>
  <text start="953.38" dur="6.72">an audit of the Fed once they show the</text>
  <text start="955.66" dur="7.34">Fed has done illegal things by</text>
  <text start="960.1" dur="5.72">transferring funds by propping up other</text>
  <text start="963" dur="5.05">countries by doing who-knows-what</text>
  <text start="965.82" dur="5.5">because they&amp;#39;re not allowing us to audit</text>
  <text start="968.05" dur="7.01">them once they&amp;#39;re audited this will</text>
  <text start="971.32" dur="7.829">allow the President of the United States</text>
  <text start="975.06" dur="8.29">to say listen this is fraud this was</text>
  <text start="979.149" dur="6.3">illegal we&amp;#39;re not going to pay this debt</text>
  <text start="983.35" dur="7.319">because this debt</text>
  <text start="985.449" dur="7.98">was done by illegal means and once you</text>
  <text start="990.669" dur="6.69">start probing like this you can actually</text>
  <text start="993.429" dur="6.72">get rid of all this debt if you can show</text>
  <text start="997.359" dur="5.22">that it was done completely illegally</text>
  <text start="1000.149" dur="5.88">and if you bring in the deep state and</text>
  <text start="1002.579" dur="6.3">show how they were involved in this well</text>
  <text start="1006.029" dur="6.451">guess what we can wipe all this out and</text>
  <text start="1008.879" dur="5.94">start the system fresh and again when we</text>
  <text start="1012.48" dur="4.019">start the system fresh it will get</text>
  <text start="1014.819" dur="3.69">easier but we&amp;#39;re gonna have this period</text>
