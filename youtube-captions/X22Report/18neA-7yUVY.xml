  <text start="82.64" dur="4.89">moment but we want to go to North Korea</text>

  <text start="109.49" dur="4.739">individuals they talked about</text>

  <text start="114.229" dur="5.551">traveled to China via Air Koryo this</text>
  <text start="117.92" dur="5.58">plane is believed to be Kim&amp;#39;s personal</text>
  <text start="119.78" dur="6.179">jet and basically they talked about what</text>
  <text start="123.5" dur="5.19">they want to do denuclearization and</text>
  <text start="125.959" dur="5.971">they&amp;#39;re both in agreement and she agree</text>
  <text start="128.69" dur="6.299">that positive progress has been made and</text>
  <text start="131.93" dur="5.04">he feels happy about this so we see</text>
  <text start="134.989" dur="5.311">right now the deep state at this point</text>
  <text start="136.97" dur="6.36">they are being pushed out but again the</text>
  <text start="140.3" dur="5.34">propaganda is picking up and the deep</text>
  <text start="143.33" dur="5.97">state might try something during this</text>
  <text start="145.64" dur="5.76">summit with Trump and Kim jong-un and we</text>
  <text start="149.3" dur="5.579">see right now that most likely Pompeo</text>
  <text start="151.4" dur="6.57">and the rest are securing the area but</text>
  <text start="154.879" dur="5.58">again anything can happen remember the</text>
  <text start="157.97" dur="5.299">deep state right now is on the losing</text>
  <text start="160.459" dur="5.161">end and they realize what is happening</text>
  <text start="163.269" dur="4.651">especially with what is happening with</text>
  <text start="165.62" dur="3.96">the Mueller case what is happening with</text>
  <text start="167.92" dur="4">North Korea</text>
  <text start="169.58" dur="4.53">and with the Iranian deal which we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="171.92" dur="4.74">going to be talking about now in Lebanon</text>
  <text start="174.11" dur="5.459">the deep state is losing out there now</text>
  <text start="176.66" dur="5.329">the deep state likes to stay in control</text>
  <text start="179.569" dur="7.261">of all these countries Lebanon Libya</text>
  <text start="181.989" dur="6.611">Iraq Sudan Ukraine they wanted Syria</text>
  <text start="186.83" dur="5.28">they wanted to eventually go into Iran</text>
  <text start="188.6" dur="4.98">and they needed to keep control of the</text>
  <text start="192.11" dur="3.92">Middle Eastern countries to keep the</text>
  <text start="193.58" dur="5.76">petrodollar pumped up propped up and</text>
  <text start="196.03" dur="4.87">basically what has been happening is a</text>
  <text start="199.34" dur="3.51">lot of these Middle Eastern countries</text>
  <text start="200.9" dur="4.26">are turning turning towards Russia and</text>
  <text start="202.85" dur="4.65">China and a lot of these Middle Eastern</text>
  <text start="205.16" dur="5.28">countries they are moving away from the</text>
  <text start="207.5" dur="5.67">deep state and they want elections they</text>
  <text start="210.44" dur="5.07">want to elect leaders they want the</text>
  <text start="213.17" dur="4.35">people to elect leaders and the deep</text>
  <text start="215.51" dur="4.29">state does not want this to happen and</text>
  <text start="217.52" dur="4.92">this is why in Lebanon the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="219.8" dur="5.85">they were hitting different election</text>
  <text start="222.44" dur="6.81">areas trying to drive the people away</text>
  <text start="225.65" dur="6">but the elections went ahead and this is</text>
  <text start="229.25" dur="5.37">the first election in what like nine</text>
  <text start="231.65" dur="5.85">years and we can see this is something</text>
  <text start="234.62" dur="5.58">that the deep state or even Israel would</text>
  <text start="237.5" dur="5.37">not want to happen Hezbollah and its</text>
  <text start="240.2" dur="6.09">allies won 67 seat majority of</text>
  <text start="242.87" dur="5.49">Parliament&amp;#39;s out of 128 equally divided</text>
  <text start="246.29" dur="3.57">between Muslims and Christians the</text>
  <text start="248.36" dur="3.15">right-wing Christians lebanese forces</text>
  <text start="249.86" dur="4.02">was the biggest winner in Sunday&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.51" dur="4.46">elections nearly doubling its number of</text>
  <text start="253.88" dur="5.07">parliamentary seats from 8 to 15</text>
  <text start="255.97" dur="4.81">Hezbollah what has 13 as allies made</text>
  <text start="258.95" dur="4.73">significant gains including the Shiite</text>
  <text start="260.78" dur="5.01">Imam movement and for the first time a</text>
  <text start="263.68" dur="3.55">proportionally representative system was</text>
  <text start="265.79" dur="4.71">in place replacing the winner-take-all</text>
  <text start="267.23" dur="6.48">one permitting more independent</text>
  <text start="270.5" dur="5.55">candidates to participate now turnout</text>
  <text start="273.71" dur="4.68">was pretty love was about 49% and</text>
  <text start="276.05" dur="5.1">remember the Islamic state was in the</text>
  <text start="278.39" dur="5.64">area trying to drive the people away and</text>
  <text start="281.15" dur="5.1">we can see right now things are not</text>
  <text start="284.03" dur="3.93">going the way the deep state would like</text>
  <text start="286.25" dur="3.69">in Lebanon the same things happening in</text>
  <text start="287.96" dur="4.709">Iraq the same things happening in Libya</text>
  <text start="289.94" dur="5.88">we see right now general Hrothgar he is</text>
  <text start="292.669" dur="5.731">now pushing through and destroying the</text>
  <text start="295.82" dur="5.37">terrorist organizations taking over more</text>
  <text start="298.4" dur="5.19">and more areas liberating the cities and</text>
  <text start="301.19" dur="5.07">towns and we can see right now the same</text>
  <text start="303.59" dur="5.13">thing is happening out in Syria where</text>
  <text start="306.26" dur="4.65">Russia and Syria they&amp;#39;re sweeping</text>
  <text start="308.72" dur="3.99">through and liberating these towns and</text>
  <text start="310.91" dur="4.68">cities and things like that and people</text>
  <text start="312.71" dur="5.67">are cheering we also see right now that</text>
  <text start="315.59" dur="4.699">the White House is going to be reviewing</text>
  <text start="318.38" dur="3.559">assistance to South Sudan</text>
  <text start="320.289" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s another country where the deep</text>
  <text start="321.939" dur="4.861">state went in and they basically wanted</text>
  <text start="324.789" dur="4.65">them to obey they want a regime change</text>
  <text start="326.8" dur="4.319">which they tried and the United States</text>
  <text start="329.439" dur="3.96">is going to review the assistance</text>
  <text start="331.119" dur="4.41">program to South Sudan the United States</text>
  <text start="333.399" dur="3.811">will initiate a comprehensive review of</text>
  <text start="335.529" dur="3.87">the assistance program to South Sudan</text>
  <text start="337.21" dur="4.289">because of the lack of progress in</text>
  <text start="339.399" dur="5.16">reaching a peace agreement to end the</text>
  <text start="341.499" dur="5.7">violence in the country now here we have</text>
  <text start="344.559" dur="4.59">all these different countries in the</text>
  <text start="347.199" dur="4.95">Middle East where the deep state came in</text>
  <text start="349.149" dur="5.76">they had regime change the people didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="352.149" dur="5.52">like this and they fought back now</text>
  <text start="354.909" dur="4.53">with Trump in office he&amp;#39;s looking at all</text>
  <text start="357.669" dur="4.11">of this actually Trump wants to remove</text>
  <text start="359.439" dur="6.66">the troops from the Middle East he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="361.779" dur="6.211">still repeating this mantra he hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="366.099" dur="3.93">stopped and I think eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="367.99" dur="4.169">going to happen we will be pulling out</text>
  <text start="370.029" dur="3.63">of these areas now of course you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="372.159" dur="3.15">still battling the deep state you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="373.659" dur="2.04">still battling the neocons you&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="375.309" dur="2.431">banning</text>
  <text start="375.699" dur="5.58">other factions but I think eventually</text>
  <text start="377.74" dur="4.919">the plan is to remove the troops from</text>
  <text start="381.279" dur="3.841">this area because there&amp;#39;s no reason for</text>
  <text start="382.659" dur="3.93">the troops to be there we see that Trump</text>
  <text start="385.12" dur="3.539">has confirmed he&amp;#39;s going through a</text>
  <text start="386.589" dur="5.88">drawer from the Iran nuclear deal</text>
  <text start="388.659" dur="6.36">now once again we can see that Iran does</text>
  <text start="392.469" dur="5.19">not like this the European nations they</text>
  <text start="395.019" dur="4.89">do not like this we see especially</text>
  <text start="397.659" dur="5.37">individuals here in the United States</text>
  <text start="399.909" dur="5.55">who are involved in the Iranian deal</text>
  <text start="403.029" dur="5.16">they don&amp;#39;t want this especially John</text>
  <text start="405.459" dur="4.68">Kerry Obama and the rest and you need to</text>
  <text start="408.189" dur="4.38">start you need to stop and think for a</text>
  <text start="410.139" dur="6.08">sec they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen</text>
  <text start="412.569" dur="7.74">because they really believe that they</text>
  <text start="416.219" dur="7.81">created this peace deal with Iran for</text>
  <text start="420.309" dur="5.521">the betterment of the country or did</text>
  <text start="424.029" dur="4.59">they do it for another reason because as</text>
  <text start="425.83" dur="5.519">we can see these individuals never did</text>
  <text start="428.619" dur="5.07">anything for the country and it seems</text>
  <text start="431.349" dur="5.67">like they&amp;#39;re very very concerned in</text>
  <text start="433.689" dur="5.91">keeping this deal together and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="437.019" dur="4.89">basically using shadow diplomacy and</text>
  <text start="439.599" dur="4.32">talking to many individuals to try to</text>
  <text start="441.909" dur="4.201">keep this whole thing together and I</text>
  <text start="443.919" dur="4.441">don&amp;#39;t believe it&amp;#39;s for the country</text>
  <text start="446.11" dur="4.649">because again they&amp;#39;re violating the</text>
  <text start="448.36" dur="5.099">Logan act now Iran is out there and</text>
  <text start="450.759" dur="3.331">they&amp;#39;re saying listen we&amp;#39;ll just go talk</text>
  <text start="453.459" dur="2.43">with the</text>
  <text start="454.09" dur="4.44">peon nations will move closer to China</text>
  <text start="455.889" dur="4.471">and Russia and basically we&amp;#39;ll deal with</text>
  <text start="458.53" dur="3.99">them instead of the United States and of</text>
  <text start="460.36" dur="5.58">course we&amp;#39;re hearing the propaganda out</text>
  <text start="462.52" dur="6.69">there that Iran is ready to attack Iran</text>
  <text start="465.94" dur="5.16">is going to attack Israel Iran is going</text>
  <text start="469.21" dur="5.37">to attack the United States and again</text>
  <text start="471.1" dur="6.09">this sounds just like North Korea when</text>
  <text start="474.58" dur="5.58">peace is being pushed all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="477.19" dur="4.86">the propaganda is war or when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="480.16" dur="5.52">trying to back out of something too deep</text>
  <text start="482.05" dur="7.98">State once again the propaganda is war</text>
  <text start="485.68" dur="7.92">or a collapse of the system like if if</text>
  <text start="490.03" dur="5.82">the people vote for brexit well the UK</text>
  <text start="493.6" dur="4.08">economy is going to implode well it</text>
  <text start="495.85" dur="3.36">didn&amp;#39;t happen but the deep state the</text>
  <text start="497.68" dur="3.299">central bankers that&amp;#39;s what they were</text>
  <text start="499.21" dur="3.66">pushing out there if there&amp;#39;s peace with</text>
  <text start="500.979" dur="3.961">North Korea we&amp;#39;re going to war if you</text>
  <text start="502.87" dur="4.89">back out of the Iranian deal we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="504.94" dur="5.67">to war that&amp;#39;s all they say and we can</text>
  <text start="507.76" dur="6.45">see right now there&amp;#39;s a specific reason</text>
  <text start="510.61" dur="5.1">why they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen now</text>
  <text start="514.21" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;s not the same reason that Israel</text>
  <text start="515.71" dur="4.199">wants Israel has been trying to get into</text>
  <text start="517.99" dur="4.38">Iran and have regime change for a very</text>
  <text start="519.909" dur="5.251">long time I think right now Trump is</text>
  <text start="522.37" dur="4.62">using Israel to push this agenda now</text>
  <text start="525.16" dur="2.88">Israel is out there and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="526.99" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re getting ready for an attack</text>
  <text start="528.04" dur="6.96">we&amp;#39;re mobilizing where we&amp;#39;re we see Iran</text>
  <text start="531.58" dur="6.3">they&amp;#39;re moving their weaponry that</text>
  <text start="535" dur="4.62">getting ready to attack and Israel opens</text>
  <text start="537.88" dur="3.66">their shelters they&amp;#39;re putting troops on</text>
  <text start="539.62" dur="4.77">high alert this has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="541.54" dur="4.26">Iran they&amp;#39;re not going to attack Israel</text>
  <text start="544.39" dur="4.11">this is the last thing on their minds</text>
  <text start="545.8" dur="4.65">right now because Trump decided to pull</text>
  <text start="548.5" dur="4.26">out of the Iranian deal actually before</text>
  <text start="550.45" dur="4.38">the Iranian deal Iran was never going to</text>
  <text start="552.76" dur="4.56">attack if you really go back in time</text>
  <text start="554.83" dur="6.03">Israel was saying that Iran was going to</text>
  <text start="557.32" dur="6.72">attack since the 80s Iran hasn&amp;#39;t started</text>
  <text start="560.86" dur="6.24">a war or attacked anyone to start a war</text>
  <text start="564.04" dur="5.94">in over 200 years they are not about to</text>
  <text start="567.1" dur="6.6">do it now this has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="569.98" dur="4.979">this but Israel their agenda is actually</text>
  <text start="573.7" dur="3.3">to go into Syria and it looks like they</text>
  <text start="574.959" dur="3.57">might have bombed or done something in</text>
  <text start="577" dur="4.77">Damascus set off a couple of missiles</text>
  <text start="578.529" dur="5.281">because their push is to really remove</text>
  <text start="581.77" dur="4.68">Assad and then eventually get into Iran</text>
  <text start="583.81" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re still on that agenda they</text>
  <text start="586.45" dur="3.75">haven&amp;#39;t stopped thing</text>
  <text start="587.92" dur="3.51">about this but I think what is happening</text>
  <text start="590.2" dur="3.27">right now when we&amp;#39;ll be talking about</text>
  <text start="591.43" dur="3.779">this in a little bit the Trump</text>
  <text start="593.47" dur="4.59">administration the Patriots they are</text>

  <text start="683.92" dur="5.88">said what what happens to the FBI quite</text>
  <text start="687.01" dur="5.22">simply when all this corrupt is exposed</text>

  <text start="694.209" dur="3.69">rolled into something completely new it</text>
  <text start="695.89" dur="4.29">seems like the Department of Justice is</text>

  <text start="704.92" dur="4.62">gutted the CIA won&amp;#39;t exist anymore</text>
  <text start="707.11" dur="4.589">actually Trump has mentioned this about</text>

  <text start="721.55" dur="5.969">see from what is happening that this</text>
  <text start="723.92" dur="6.599">could be a possibility now Q says who is</text>
  <text start="727.519" dur="6.301">the FBI director Ray who must approve</text>

  <text start="759.56" dur="4.89">walking duck disclosures probably</text>
  <text start="762.32" dur="5.34">because the root of this evil goes so</text>

  <text start="822.11" dur="4.229">don&amp;#39;t want to release this right now q</text>
  <text start="824.27" dur="6.12">went on to say what does it mean if a</text>
  <text start="826.339" dur="6.931">grand jury is impaneled now unlike trial</text>
  <text start="830.39" dur="5.46">juries grand juries don&amp;#39;t weigh in on</text>

  <text start="847.459" dur="6.811">impanel a grand journey grand jury and</text>
  <text start="850.339" dur="5.161">they usually only do so when a serious</text>

  <text start="855.5" dur="6.09">are a possibility like a trial jury a</text>
  <text start="858.83" dur="4.65">grand jury is presented with evidence</text>
  <text start="861.59" dur="3.99">exhibits and testimony from witnesses</text>
  <text start="863.48" dur="4.41">about matters pertinent to the</text>
  <text start="865.58" dur="6.24">investigation but the setting in which</text>
  <text start="867.89" dur="6.6">the this unfolds is different trial</text>
  <text start="871.82" dur="4.83">juries meet with a judge lawyers</text>
  <text start="874.49" dur="3.87">defendants and the plaintiffs are</text>
  <text start="876.65" dur="3.09">present and the proceedings are</text>
  <text start="878.36" dur="3.99">generally open to the public</text>
  <text start="879.74" dur="5.43">grand juries on the other hand meet in</text>
  <text start="882.35" dur="5.79">secret and aside from prosecutor who</text>
  <text start="885.17" dur="5.13">press the charges nobody else is usually</text>
  <text start="888.14" dur="4.59">present crucially the potential</text>
  <text start="890.3" dur="4.71">defendants that is the person of people</text>
  <text start="892.73" dur="4.38">against whom charges might be pressed</text>
  <text start="895.01" dur="5.4">are not allowed to attend grand jury</text>
  <text start="897.11" dur="6.9">proceedings so we answered that of why</text>
  <text start="900.41" dur="6.09">the grand jury is impaneled and QED went</text>
  <text start="904.01" dur="5.34">on to say why are confusing questions</text>
  <text start="906.5" dur="4.02">asked to the outcome ar e Muller what</text>
  <text start="909.35" dur="3.57">would be the purpose of creating</text>
  <text start="910.52" dur="4.71">confusion what with sessions Senate</text>
  <text start="912.92" dur="4.59">confirmation vote what was rod Rosen</text>
  <text start="915.23" dur="4.98">seemed sent a confirmation vote if Ron</text>
  <text start="917.51" dur="3.09">Rosen scene is dirty Muller also must be</text>
  <text start="920.21" dur="3.24">dirty</text>
  <text start="920.6" dur="5.97">if Muller is dirty rotten Stein must</text>
  <text start="923.45" dur="6.12">also be dirty common denominator why did</text>
  <text start="926.57" dur="4.8">sessions pick Ron Rosenstein so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="929.57" dur="5.34">think about this for a second why is</text>
  <text start="931.37" dur="5.91">there so much confusion with Muller well</text>
  <text start="934.91" dur="5.34">a lot of people think that he&amp;#39;s a white</text>
  <text start="937.28" dur="7.31">hat and he&amp;#39;s undercover right now where</text>
  <text start="940.25" dur="8.25">everyone believes he&amp;#39;s looking into the</text>
  <text start="944.59" dur="7.03">Russian collusion and he really isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="948.5" dur="5.22">while that is his cover many people</text>
  <text start="951.62" dur="4.94">think that what&amp;#39;s happening behind the</text>
  <text start="953.72" dur="5.57">scenes is that Muller is actually</text>
  <text start="956.56" dur="5.62">investigating Hillary Clinton and</text>
  <text start="959.29" dur="4.87">basically the corporate media the deep</text>
  <text start="962.18" dur="3.99">state says you can&amp;#39;t fire Muller</text>
  <text start="964.16" dur="3.57">you can&amp;#39;t find Anna Mueller he has to</text>
  <text start="966.17" dur="4.23">stay there he has to stay there now</text>
  <text start="967.73" dur="5.31">think about this for a second he has the</text>
  <text start="970.4" dur="6.36">deep state the corporate media pushing</text>
  <text start="973.04" dur="5.31">that line where you can&amp;#39;t get rid of him</text>
  <text start="976.76" dur="4.17">now Trump is never gonna fire him</text>
  <text start="978.35" dur="3.81">because that would be ridiculous because</text>
  <text start="980.93" dur="3.69">then they would point the fingers at</text>
  <text start="982.16" dur="6.27">Trump saying look he was getting close</text>
  <text start="984.62" dur="4.65">you fired him and you must be guilty so</text>
  <text start="988.43" dur="2.31">the end</text>
  <text start="989.27" dur="2.46">means the deep state the corporate media</text>
  <text start="990.74" dur="3.42">the screaming that Mueller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="991.73" dur="4.59">investigation is legitimate for months</text>
  <text start="994.16" dur="4.5">so his investigation is legitimate and</text>
  <text start="996.32" dur="4.02">then what are they going to say when</text>
  <text start="998.66" dur="4.29">they are suddenly confronted with the</text>
  <text start="1000.34" dur="4.8">truth where he was never investigating</text>
  <text start="1002.95" dur="4.2">Russian collusion he was investigating</text>
  <text start="1005.14" dur="3.87">something completely different is this</text>
  <text start="1007.15" dur="4.29">the purpose is this the reason why</text>
  <text start="1009.01" dur="5.28">there&amp;#39;s so much confusion is this the</text>
  <text start="1011.44" dur="4.8">cover remember a lot of the things that</text>
  <text start="1014.29" dur="4.47">we see happening right now is not</text>
  <text start="1016.24" dur="4.62">exactly what is happening now he also</text>
  <text start="1018.76" dur="3.24">asked what was session Senate</text>
  <text start="1020.86" dur="3.75">confirmation vote</text>
  <text start="1022" dur="4.92">well his confirmation vote was fifty two</text>
  <text start="1024.61" dur="5.07">in favor forty seven against it was very</text>
  <text start="1026.92" dur="4.68">very close deep state most likely not</text>
  <text start="1029.68" dur="4.5">because when you have the deep state it</text>
  <text start="1031.6" dur="5.07">looks like those that are in favor is a</text>
  <text start="1034.18" dur="4.529">lot higher rod Rosenstein Senate</text>
  <text start="1036.67" dur="4.89">confirmation vote was ninety four in</text>
  <text start="1038.709" dur="5.161">favor six against and that&amp;#39;s why he said</text>
  <text start="1041.56" dur="2.91">if rod Rhodes Encinas dirty Mueller must</text>
  <text start="1043.87" dur="2.88">be dirty</text>
  <text start="1044.47" dur="4.98">if Mueller is dirty rotten steam must be</text>
  <text start="1046.75" dur="5.28">dirty common denominator now did Mueller</text>
  <text start="1049.45" dur="5.43">switch over and become a white hat where</text>
  <text start="1052.03" dur="7.23">Ron Rosenstein maybe he still a black</text>
  <text start="1054.88" dur="6.99">hat or are both working with Trump to</text>
  <text start="1059.26" dur="5.34">set the deep stayed up because why did</text>
  <text start="1061.87" dur="6.36">sessions pick rod Rosenstein was it</text>
  <text start="1064.6" dur="6.84">because it was a cover it could be now Q</text>
  <text start="1068.23" dur="6.36">came out and said that the midterms are</text>
  <text start="1071.44" dur="5.79">safe and there&amp;#39;s no reason to worry</text>
  <text start="1074.59" dur="6.48">about the midterms we go back to post</text>

  <text start="1321.69" dur="6.27">what happened with the Iranian deal they</text>

  <text start="1444.99" dur="5.82">North Korea why would Trump now pick</text>
  <text start="1447.75" dur="7.14">Iran where he knows China and Russia</text>
  <text start="1450.81" dur="9.09">would defend Iran it makes no sense plus</text>
