  <text start="114.34" dur="5.1">maybe a half a percentage or one percent</text>
  <text start="116.92" dur="4.8">they tell you you see we&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="119.44" dur="6.599">incredible recovery while the eurozone</text>
  <text start="121.72" dur="7.44">is out there and they&amp;#39;re making a really</text>

  <text start="134.11" dur="5.629">saying yes the eurozone we&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="137.05" dur="5.49">incredible recovery it can&amp;#39;t be stopped</text>
  <text start="139.739" dur="5.141">well this is ridiculous because</text>
  <text start="142.54" dur="4.89">unemployment fluctuates all the time and</text>
  <text start="144.88" dur="4.439">point one percent is absolutely</text>
  <text start="147.43" dur="4.29">meaningless at this time even if it went</text>
  <text start="149.319" dur="7.021">up to 10.6 it really doesn&amp;#39;t tell us</text>
  <text start="151.72" dur="5.849">anything and what we are seeing and if</text>
  <text start="156.34" dur="4.08">you look at the big picture and you step</text>
  <text start="157.569" dur="4.911">back we notice that unemployment really</text>
  <text start="160.42" dur="7.98">hasn&amp;#39;t changed</text>
  <text start="162.48" dur="10.21">since 2008 it stayed in this range and</text>
  <text start="168.4" dur="5.97">it is absolutely awful it&amp;#39;s like saying</text>
  <text start="172.69" dur="3.42">oh look our unemployment is at thirty</text>
  <text start="174.37" dur="3.96">percent now we&amp;#39;re at twenty nine point</text>
  <text start="176.11" dur="4.11">nine percent oh my god we&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="178.33" dur="7.77">incredible recovery everyone&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="180.22" dur="9.48">jobs no because the point 1 percentage</text>
  <text start="186.1" dur="7.26">is absolutely meaningless in either</text>
  <text start="189.7" dur="7.38">direction if you step back you see it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="193.36" dur="6.78">flat line it is gone absolutely nowhere</text>

  <text start="401.71" dur="3.21">in this is not just in Canada this is</text>

  <text start="410.71" dur="6.71">coming back to the source and we see</text>

  <text start="450.22" dur="4.5">the economy improving yes we have the</text>
  <text start="453.04" dur="4.77">talking heads the corporate media the US</text>
  <text start="454.72" dur="6.18">government the central bank&amp;#39;s using</text>
  <text start="457.81" dur="4.8">propaganda to convince everyone keeping</text>
  <text start="460.9" dur="4.83">the illusion alive but when we look at</text>
  <text start="462.61" dur="7.34">these real economic facts all we see is</text>
  <text start="465.73" dur="9.8">a decline all we see is a collapse and</text>
  <text start="469.95" dur="9.94">to add to all of this the u.s. debt</text>
  <text start="475.53" dur="6.82">which is reported and presented to the</text>
  <text start="479.89" dur="5.82">public and we know there is a shadow</text>
  <text start="482.35" dur="7.23">debt but let&amp;#39;s use the debt that we just</text>
  <text start="485.71" dur="7.89">say because it&amp;#39;s at 19 trillion and we</text>
  <text start="489.58" dur="7.11">have to remember that when Obama took</text>
  <text start="493.6" dur="6.54">office the debt was around ten point six</text>
  <text start="496.69" dur="5.7">trillion it is almost doubled actually</text>
  <text start="500.14" dur="9.39">by the timing leaves office it will be</text>
  <text start="502.39" dur="13.07">doubled how possibly can the US</text>
  <text start="509.53" dur="10.59">government support this debt on the</text>
  <text start="515.46" dur="7.84">revenue coming in from part-time workers</text>
  <text start="520.12" dur="7.1">think about this for a second as more</text>
  <text start="523.3" dur="7.13">and more full-time jobs disappear and</text>
  <text start="527.22" dur="6.64">more and more part-time jobs are created</text>
  <text start="530.43" dur="5.65">there is less revenue coming into the</text>
  <text start="533.86" dur="4.979">government and we can see this is why</text>
  <text start="536.08" dur="5.25">they needed to create Obamacare to bring</text>
  <text start="538.839" dur="5.761">in tax revenue this is why they want a</text>
  <text start="541.33" dur="5.49">carbon tax this is why the the IMF is</text>
  <text start="544.6" dur="9.02">calling for a ten percent wealth tax</text>
  <text start="546.82" dur="6.8">because the debt the debt level is</text>
  <text start="554.61" dur="4.51">ridiculously high and cannot be</text>
  <text start="556.6" dur="5.37">sustained now of course yes the US has</text>
  <text start="559.12" dur="3.45">the ability through the Fed to create</text>
  <text start="561.97" dur="3.12">fun</text>
  <text start="562.57" dur="4.55">and this sounds fantastic and people</text>
  <text start="565.09" dur="5.76">saying oh they can create this currency</text>
  <text start="567.12" dur="6.49">forever until all the other nations</text>
  <text start="570.85" dur="5.19">around the globe say okay we just lost</text>
  <text start="573.61" dur="4.92">all credibility hmm the debt is way too</text>
  <text start="576.04" dur="6.53">high we know they can never repay it and</text>
  <text start="578.53" dur="8.42">the dollar starts losing value people</text>
  <text start="582.57" dur="8.11">look at it and say okay this whole thing</text>
  <text start="586.95" dur="5.29">cannot be supported and we don&amp;#39;t want a</text>
  <text start="590.68" dur="5.25">loan or we don&amp;#39;t want to do business</text>
  <text start="592.24" dur="6.36">with or whatever the reason is this is</text>
  <text start="595.93" dur="6.78">when the whole thing falls apart and we</text>
  <text start="598.6" dur="8.4">are approaching that point now while the</text>
  <text start="602.71" dur="7.86">debt is continually moving up we see the</text>
  <text start="607" dur="5.67">economic freedom the ranking for the</text>
  <text start="610.57" dur="6.11">United States has fallen to eleventh</text>
  <text start="612.67" dur="6.99">place during the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="616.68" dur="5.8">now when we were growing up when I was</text>
  <text start="619.66" dur="5.64">younger we were taught that America was</text>
  <text start="622.48" dur="6.24">the freest country in the world in every</text>
  <text start="625.3" dur="5.22">conceivable way that you could start</text>

  <text start="630.52" dur="7.89">you want to do and you have an easy time</text>
  <text start="632.74" dur="8.19">doing it well it seems that that is kind</text>
  <text start="638.41" dur="5.79">of changed at this point the Heritage</text>
  <text start="640.93" dur="7.29">Foundation which released the 2016 index</text>
  <text start="644.2" dur="7.47">for economic freedom found that we went</text>
  <text start="648.22" dur="8.16">from sixth place when Obama took office</text>
  <text start="651.67" dur="8.19">to eleventh place now when they pass the</text>
  <text start="656.38" dur="7.17">TPP guess what the economic freedom is</text>
  <text start="659.86" dur="6.66">going to drop even further if you ever</text>
  <text start="663.55" dur="7.73">notice whenever the government decides</text>
  <text start="666.52" dur="8.01">to meddle in free markets education and</text>
  <text start="671.28" dur="8.05">everything else they seem to destroy</text>
  <text start="674.53" dur="8.19">everything and the reasons the Heritage</text>
  <text start="679.33" dur="5.49">Foundation dropped the ranking include</text>
  <text start="682.72" dur="4.38">the following the explosion of</text>

  <text start="745.93" dur="9.48">good for us well guess what it is not</text>
  <text start="750.07" dur="10.16">this system is falling apart America is</text>
