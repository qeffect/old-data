  <text start="212.25" dur="4.98">all over the corporate media I see it</text>
  <text start="214.56" dur="4.41">coming out of the the US government</text>
  <text start="217.23" dur="4.319">where they&amp;#39;re telling us that auto sales</text>
  <text start="218.97" dur="4.439">are fantastic right now actually they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="221.549" dur="3.75">in a downward trend and we talked about</text>
  <text start="223.409" dur="4.44">channel stuffing we talked about how</text>
  <text start="225.299" dur="5.071">they manipulate the sales because every</text>
  <text start="227.849" dur="5.911">time the cars are received at dealers</text>
  <text start="230.37" dur="6.03">those are considered sales not when they</text>
  <text start="233.76" dur="5.009">actually sell them to the people but</text>
  <text start="236.4" dur="5.459">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is domestic</text>
  <text start="238.769" dur="6.571">auto sales they came in a bit weaker</text>
  <text start="241.859" dur="5.25">than they expected the total numbers</text>
  <text start="245.34" dur="4.109">right now are out and they are much</text>
  <text start="247.109" dur="5.16">worse than what they thought they were</text>
  <text start="249.449" dur="5.85">going to be Bloomberg econo day</text>
  <text start="252.269" dur="7.02">consensus the total vehicle sales in</text>
  <text start="255.299" dur="6.201">June was 17.3 million and the actual</text>
  <text start="259.289" dur="5.281">report when you look at it it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="261.5" dur="4.27">16.7 million sales so when we look at</text>
  <text start="264.57" dur="3.87">the graph and we look at see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="265.77" dur="5.22">happening here we see we had a steady</text>
  <text start="268.44" dur="7.56">increase of sales starting back July</text>
  <text start="270.99" dur="9.03">2012 moving all the way up into October</text>
  <text start="276" dur="7.59">of 2015 that&amp;#39;s when it plateaued at</text>
  <text start="280.02" dur="8.3">plateaued around 18 or so million sales</text>
  <text start="283.59" dur="8.97">and now we are on a downward trend June</text>
  <text start="288.32" dur="7.48">2016 we drop from 18 million down to 17</text>
  <text start="292.56" dur="5.07">and in April of 2016 it looks like it</text>
  <text start="295.8" dur="5.58">came down to about six</text>
  <text start="297.63" dur="6.63">point seven or so and then between april</text>
  <text start="301.38" dur="4.86">and july we had a little bit of a surge</text>
  <text start="304.26" dur="4.05">where the manufacturers produced a lot</text>
  <text start="306.24" dur="3.81">more cars they try to channel stuff a</text>
  <text start="308.31" dur="4.83">lot more of these cars into lots which</text>
  <text start="310.05" dur="4.92">are counted as sales and that shot up to</text>
  <text start="313.14" dur="5.94">about 17 million but it is dropped back</text>
  <text start="314.97" dur="6.75">down in July to the 16.7 million mark so</text>
  <text start="319.08" dur="4.17">we can see we&amp;#39;re on a downward trend yes</text>
  <text start="321.72" dur="5.07">we had a little surge little dead cat</text>
  <text start="323.25" dur="5.46">bounce there but the trend is down we</text>
  <text start="326.79" dur="3.78">see the debt of the United States well</text>
  <text start="328.71" dur="3.38">that is creeping up once again it was</text>
  <text start="330.57" dur="4.02">holding steady for the last few months</text>
  <text start="332.09" dur="4.09">total government debt hit a record of</text>
  <text start="334.59" dur="4.92">nineteen point three eight trillion on</text>
  <text start="336.18" dur="6.57">Thursday up ninety eight billion from</text>
  <text start="339.51" dur="5.58">the day before and we know right now the</text>
  <text start="342.75" dur="3.96">calculations are out by the time Obama</text>
  <text start="345.09" dur="4.83">leaves office the debt is going to be</text>
  <text start="346.71" dur="4.35">around 20 trillion dollars now we know</text>
  <text start="349.92" dur="3.42">the corporate media and the government</text>
  <text start="351.06" dur="4.23">and the EU are all out there trying to</text>
  <text start="353.34" dur="3.9">tell us that because of the brexit the</text>
  <text start="355.29" dur="3.42">economy is going to be a lot worse</text>
  <text start="357.24" dur="5.1">that&amp;#39;s going to struggle it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="358.71" dur="6.83">because of the brexit well we know this</text>
  <text start="362.34" dur="5.7">is not true we&amp;#39;ve been following the</text>
  <text start="365.54" dur="4.11">economy we&amp;#39;ve been watching it collapsed</text>
  <text start="368.04" dur="6.54">we&amp;#39;ve been watching it deteriorate and</text>
  <text start="369.65" dur="8.35">we see that the CL sa they also are</text>
  <text start="374.58" dur="6.21">saying that the economy the way it is</text>
  <text start="378" dur="6.54">right now has nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="380.79" dur="6.18">brexit in a recent note the CL sa wrote</text>
  <text start="384.54" dur="4.89">the world trade growth had hit a new</text>
  <text start="386.97" dur="6.68">post global financial crisis low long</text>
  <text start="389.43" dur="7.98">before the brexit ever came about and</text>
  <text start="393.65" dur="7.45">this is absolutely true the economies</text>
  <text start="397.41" dur="6.27">were already collapsing and in many</text>
  <text start="401.1" dur="4.2">respects we can see that the economy we</text>
  <text start="403.68" dur="3">have passed the recession point because</text>
  <text start="405.3" dur="3.81">a lot of the economic indicators are</text>
  <text start="406.68" dur="7.29">much much worse than two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="409.11" dur="7.86">and we see that this whole brexit and as</text>
  <text start="413.97" dur="6.03">we keep looking at it we&amp;#39;re noticing</text>
  <text start="416.97" dur="6.99">that the EU has a different plan in mind</text>
  <text start="420" dur="8.94">to expand the European Union to make it</text>
  <text start="423.96" dur="7.41">an empire and remember the UK referendum</text>
  <text start="428.94" dur="4.4">was an advisory referendum the part</text>
  <text start="431.37" dur="4.049">at the EU they have doesn&amp;#39;t nothing yet</text>
  <text start="433.34" dur="4.21">so we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch on that</text>
  <text start="435.419" dur="4.981">but the latest EU foreign policy</text>
  <text start="437.55" dur="4.32">document titled a global strategy for</text>
  <text start="440.4" dur="4.38">the European Union&amp;#39;s foreign and</text>
  <text start="441.87" dur="5.97">security policy calls for an extension</text>
  <text start="444.78" dur="6.859">of the union&amp;#39;s influence in regions as</text>
  <text start="447.84" dur="7.88">far as Central Asia and Central Africa</text>
  <text start="451.639" dur="6.611">what it outlines it is gradual</text>
  <text start="455.72" dur="6.49">synchronization and mutual adaption</text>
  <text start="458.25" dur="6.03">between different member states and this</text>
  <text start="462.21" dur="4.44">is what the executive summary reads it</text>
  <text start="464.28" dur="4.68">is in the interest of our citizens to</text>
  <text start="466.65" dur="6.21">invest in the resilience of states and</text>
  <text start="468.96" dur="5.88">societies to east to the east stretching</text>
  <text start="472.86" dur="5.339">into Central Asia and to the south down</text>
  <text start="474.84" dur="5.37">to Central Africa the document it speaks</text>
  <text start="478.199" dur="4.44">about transforming the current EU system</text>
  <text start="480.21" dur="6.36">and commits to the deliverance of global</text>
  <text start="482.639" dur="6.961">governing body so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="486.57" dur="6.5">right now is that the EU wants autonomy</text>
  <text start="489.6" dur="8.72">and defence and security matters and</text>
  <text start="493.07" dur="8.4">they want the EU to act autonomously</text>
  <text start="498.32" dur="6.13">from NATO but contributing and</text>
  <text start="501.47" dur="5.62">cooperating with NATO so we can see</text>
  <text start="504.45" dur="5.82">right now they&amp;#39;re planning to create</text>
  <text start="507.09" dur="6.18">this empire by moving into Asia and down</text>
  <text start="510.27" dur="6.99">into Africa this was the plan all along</text>
  <text start="513.27" dur="5.73">and what they needed to do is they</text>
  <text start="517.26" dur="4.74">needed to let the air out of the bubble</text>
  <text start="519" dur="5.73">a little bit and we can see that did</text>
  <text start="522" dur="5.64">happen they were able to use this crisis</text>
  <text start="524.73" dur="5.07">to say ah we can create funds now we can</text>
  <text start="527.64" dur="3.81">do emergency bailouts but this is all</text>
  <text start="529.8" dur="3.36">because of the brexit and we know this</text>
  <text start="531.45" dur="5.759">is not what it is they&amp;#39;re using it as an</text>
  <text start="533.16" dur="6.45">excuse we see with Obama care companies</text>
  <text start="537.209" dur="4.171">are facing a huge amount of losses much</text>
  <text start="539.61" dur="5.4">higher than they initially anticipated</text>
  <text start="541.38" dur="4.89">and we can see right now is that the</text>
  <text start="545.01" dur="3.9">Department of Health and Human Services</text>
  <text start="546.27" dur="5.4">has been unable to keep up the demands</text>
  <text start="548.91" dur="6.179">for funds from its risk corridor program</text>
  <text start="551.67" dur="4.95">basically bailout program and we can see</text>
  <text start="555.089" dur="3.841">right now more of these insurance</text>
  <text start="556.62" dur="3.87">companies are asking for these bailouts</text>
  <text start="558.93" dur="3.39">they need more money to losing a lot of</text>
  <text start="560.49" dur="5">money a lot of people are not joining up</text>
  <text start="562.32" dur="6.33">and it&amp;#39;s getting worse as time goes on</text>
  <text start="565.49" dur="7.63">now the feds always talk about</text>
  <text start="568.65" dur="7.92">encryption and how they need to get into</text>
  <text start="573.12" dur="5.01">our personal electronic data because</text>
  <text start="576.57" dur="3.03">terrorists are using encryption all over</text>
  <text start="578.13" dur="3.6">the place well first of all we know</text>
  <text start="579.6" dur="4.32">terrorists are not going to be using the</text>
  <text start="581.73" dur="4.65">everyday devices to plan something if</text>
  <text start="583.92" dur="4.26">there are terrorists out there planning</text>
  <text start="586.38" dur="3.72">something they&amp;#39;re going to have their</text>
  <text start="588.18" dur="5.42">own system they&amp;#39;re going to create their</text>
  <text start="590.1" dur="7.56">own encryption they might even use</text>
  <text start="593.6" dur="8.02">non-electronic type of devices to send</text>
  <text start="597.66" dur="6.27">messages back and forth so is encryption</text>
  <text start="601.62" dur="5.64">really a problem that the FBI is making</text>
  <text start="603.93" dur="6.72">it out to be well there&amp;#39;s a new report</text>
  <text start="607.26" dur="6.33">called the wiretap report and this</text>
  <text start="610.65" dur="5.7">states for the second straight year the</text>
  <text start="613.59" dur="4.58">number of times state or federal wire</text>
  <text start="616.35" dur="6.69">types that encountered encryption</text>
  <text start="618.17" dur="8.53">decreased so they only couldn&amp;#39;t break</text>
  <text start="623.04" dur="10.35">encryption in cases that are around 11</text>
  <text start="626.7" dur="9.27">or so in 2015 out of a total of 4148</text>
  <text start="633.39" dur="5.72">wiretaps according to the new data</text>
  <text start="635.97" dur="5.04">published by wiretap the number of state</text>
  <text start="639.11" dur="5.92">wiretaps in which encryption was</text>
  <text start="641.01" dur="9.75">encountered decreased from 22 in 20 14</text>
  <text start="645.03" dur="8.94">to seven and six federal wiretap report</text>
  <text start="650.76" dur="7.62">is being encrypted so how big an issue</text>
  <text start="653.97" dur="7.59">is encryption not that big the only</text>
  <text start="658.38" dur="6.99">reason they were using it was to</text>
  <text start="661.56" dur="7.08">convince everyone to allow access to all</text>
  <text start="665.37" dur="5.85">their data they want the information and</text>
  <text start="668.64" dur="5.4">they want an easy way to get it they</text>
  <text start="671.22" dur="5.16">want back doors but remember we need to</text>
  <text start="674.04" dur="4.5">continually use encryption there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="676.38" dur="4.5">reason they need to see our personal</text>
  <text start="678.54" dur="4.53">information just like you use a safe to</text>
  <text start="680.88" dur="4.86">keep your documents just like you lock</text>
  <text start="683.07" dur="4.8">your house you lock your car well you</text>
  <text start="685.74" dur="4.47">need to lock up your data protect</text>
  <text start="687.87" dur="5.46">yourself so wherever you can use</text>
  <text start="690.21" dur="4.95">encryption for your email you can block</text>
  <text start="693.33" dur="4.2">the signal from your cell phone by using</text>
  <text start="695.16" dur="3.84">a product called blog apakah calm these</text>
  <text start="697.53" dur="3.75">are sleeves enter</text>
  <text start="699" dur="3.66">with metal which blocks the signal you</text>
  <text start="701.28" dur="3.57">can also use them for your credit card</text>
  <text start="702.66" dur="5.01">you can slip them in and it blocks the</text>
  <text start="704.85" dur="6.93">signal from the chip and it provides</text>
