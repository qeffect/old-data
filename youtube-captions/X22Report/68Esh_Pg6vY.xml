  <text start="43.34" dur="4.859">current economic collapse news brief</text>
  <text start="45.8" dur="5.06">let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="48.199" dur="6.211">collapse news now we have been watching</text>
  <text start="50.86" dur="5.14">different parts of the economy we were</text>
  <text start="54.41" dur="4.71">looking at many different indicators</text>
  <text start="56" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at GDP we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="59.12" dur="3.96">looking at global defaults we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="60.83" dur="6.45">looking at contraction retail we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="63.08" dur="6.24">looking at the housing bubble and we can</text>
  <text start="67.28" dur="4.68">see that everything is pointing to a</text>
  <text start="69.32" dur="5.82">downward trend now when we look at</text>
  <text start="71.96" dur="5.55">earnings for corporations we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="75.14" dur="4.37">that earnings they&amp;#39;re declining by</text>
  <text start="77.51" dur="4.95">negative three-point-seven percent</text>
  <text start="79.51" dur="6.039">putting this quote the third quarter on</text>
  <text start="82.46" dur="5.37">pace for the fifth consecutive decline</text>
  <text start="85.549" dur="4.5">in earnings since the third quarter of</text>
  <text start="87.83" dur="5.13">two thousand eight to through the third</text>
  <text start="90.049" dur="5.941">quarter of two thousand nine and this is</text>
  <text start="92.96" dur="6.509">showing us that the stock market is</text>
  <text start="95.99" dur="7.5">continually rising it is completely</text>
  <text start="99.469" dur="6.51">manipulated and corporations are laying</text>
  <text start="103.49" dur="7.86">off individuals they&amp;#39;re buying back</text>
  <text start="105.979" dur="6.901">their stocks sales are down and this all</text>
  <text start="111.35" dur="6.18">points to one thing and one thing only</text>
  <text start="112.88" dur="8.339">is that the market right now is one big</text>
  <text start="117.53" dur="7.29">complete manipulation now we understand</text>
  <text start="121.219" dur="5.97">out in the UK we had this advisory</text>
  <text start="124.82" dur="5.969">referendum nothing has been done as of</text>
  <text start="127.189" dur="7.831">yet and the man who wrote article 50 he</text>
  <text start="130.789" dur="8.541">has admitted it was never supposed to be</text>
  <text start="135.02" dur="7.38">used mr. Amato told a conference in Rome</text>
  <text start="139.33" dur="5.59">he had inserted the get out clause</text>
  <text start="142.4" dur="4.83">specifically to prevent the British from</text>
  <text start="144.92" dur="5.19">complaining that there was no clear-cut</text>
  <text start="147.23" dur="6.99">official way for them to bail out of the</text>
  <text start="150.11" dur="6.66">Union he said my intention was that it</text>
  <text start="154.22" dur="6.72">should be a classic safety valve that</text>
  <text start="156.77" dur="6.6">was there but never used and this is</text>
  <text start="160.94" dur="3.09">actually what we&amp;#39;ve been watching out in</text>
  <text start="163.37" dur="2.73">the UK</text>
  <text start="164.03" dur="4.53">because they keep talking how the UK is</text>
  <text start="166.1" dur="4.859">going to leave but there are certain</text>
  <text start="168.56" dur="6.149">steps they must do before they do this</text>
  <text start="170.959" dur="6.241">and one of them is to enact article 50</text>
  <text start="174.709" dur="4.711">and we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch that</text>
  <text start="177.2" dur="7.53">situation to see if this is actually</text>
  <text start="179.42" dur="8.46">done now out in Libya we understand the</text>
  <text start="184.73" dur="5.64">coalition forces they are inside the</text>
  <text start="187.88" dur="7.14">country now of course they&amp;#39;re giving us</text>
  <text start="190.37" dur="8.07">the illusionary talk that they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="195.02" dur="4.4">there fighting the Islamic state but we</text>
  <text start="198.44" dur="3.6">know that&amp;#39;s not why they&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="199.42" dur="5.74">they&amp;#39;re there to keep the unity</text>
  <text start="202.04" dur="5.88">government in power they&amp;#39;re there to</text>
  <text start="205.16" dur="5.94">stop those who oppose the puppet</text>
  <text start="207.92" dur="6.77">government and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="211.1" dur="7.71">armed groups in Libya they&amp;#39;re mobilizing</text>
  <text start="214.69" dur="9.03">against the French and any other foreign</text>
  <text start="218.81" dur="8.37">troops that are in the country and this</text>
  <text start="223.72" dur="7.06">shows us that the people are not behind</text>
  <text start="227.18" dur="5.7">the unity government this shows us the</text>
  <text start="230.78" dur="4.769">people are not behind the foreign</text>
  <text start="232.88" dur="6.21">governments in that country this shows</text>
  <text start="235.549" dur="6.121">us that the people want to elect their</text>
  <text start="239.09" dur="4.08">own government but of course United</text>
  <text start="241.67" dur="4.26">Sates government central bankers they do</text>
  <text start="243.17" dur="6.72">not want this they want to tell the</text>
  <text start="245.93" dur="10.1">people who they&amp;#39;re going to believe it</text>
  <text start="249.89" dur="8.339">by now out in Turkey turkey is</text>
  <text start="256.03" dur="6.04">scratching their head they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="258.229" dur="5.821">surprised that since the coup that</text>
  <text start="262.07" dur="5.849">there&amp;#39;s been no high-ranking EU</text>
  <text start="264.05" dur="5.55">officials in the country of Turkey to</text>
  <text start="267.919" dur="4.381">express our support for democratic</text>
  <text start="269.6" dur="7.189">values that we share and this is coming</text>
  <text start="272.3" dur="8.4">from the EU affairs minister omar Cilic</text>
  <text start="276.789" dur="7.931">we see also that turkey has arrested the</text>
  <text start="280.7" dur="7.95">nephew afaa tula Gulen the nephew is</text>
  <text start="284.72" dur="6.3">Mohammed Saeed g√ºlen and he was arrested</text>
  <text start="288.65" dur="4.71">and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to watch that</text>
  <text start="291.02" dur="6">situation very carefully right now Irwin</text>
  <text start="293.36" dur="4.47">has tightened his grip he is also closed</text>
  <text start="297.02" dur="2.22">thousands of</text>
  <text start="297.83" dur="4.05">private schools charities other</text>
  <text start="299.24" dur="5.97">institutions in his first degree since</text>
  <text start="301.88" dur="5.37">imposing state of emergency and we also</text>
  <text start="305.21" dur="4.98">see there are 300 members of turkeys</text>
  <text start="307.25" dur="7.44">Presidential Guard that were detained</text>
  <text start="310.19" dur="8.01">after the failed coup and they are also</text>
  <text start="314.69" dur="6.3">removed from active duty now Obama is</text>
  <text start="318.2" dur="4.17">out there he is completely rejecting any</text>
  <text start="320.99" dur="5.36">claims that the u.s. had prior knowledge</text>
  <text start="322.37" dur="7.74">of the attempted coup and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="326.35" dur="6.94">expressing to her one to tamp down any</text>
  <text start="330.11" dur="6.48">rumors America had any type of</text>
  <text start="333.29" dur="6.48">involvement and of course right there</text>
  <text start="336.59" dur="4.95">and then is showing us that the United</text>
  <text start="339.77" dur="6.45">States had something to do with the coup</text>
  <text start="341.54" dur="6.93">and it went self now did her one know</text>
  <text start="346.22" dur="4.98">about the coup well there are</text>
  <text start="348.47" dur="5.55">indications that he might have had prior</text>
  <text start="351.2" dur="5.31">knowledge to what was going on because</text>
  <text start="354.02" dur="5.34">he&amp;#39;s already had these lists prepared</text>
  <text start="356.51" dur="5.1">ahead of time to remove those people who</text>
  <text start="359.36" dur="4.2">are a threat to his authority he also</text>
  <text start="361.61" dur="5.34">doesn&amp;#39;t want his people to have the</text>
  <text start="363.56" dur="7.98">freedom to look at other information</text>
  <text start="366.95" dur="7.38">like on Twitter Facebook YouTube because</text>
  <text start="371.54" dur="5.16">we know in other false flag events where</text>
  <text start="374.33" dur="5.88">he had his troops sneak into Syria fire</text>
  <text start="376.7" dur="7.23">missiles back into Turkey he basically</text>
  <text start="380.21" dur="6.63">blocked Twitter he blocked youtube he</text>
  <text start="383.93" dur="4.77">blocked facebook and we can see he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="386.84" dur="4.55">doing the same exact thing at this point</text>
  <text start="388.7" dur="5.31">and we see the Turkish protesters</text>
  <text start="391.39" dur="10.11">they&amp;#39;ve been sprayed in spray painting</text>
  <text start="394.01" dur="10.8">the numbers 8888 and 8844 on moles and</text>
  <text start="401.5" dur="6.64">there is a meaning behind these numbers</text>
  <text start="404.81" dur="5.75">to most it just looks like these are</text>
  <text start="408.14" dur="4.68">just numbers but these are DNS numbers</text>
  <text start="410.56" dur="4.87">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="412.82" dur="5.7">that the Turkish government they are</text>
  <text start="415.43" dur="6.24">shutting down Twitter they are blocking</text>
  <text start="418.52" dur="4.92">it and we see right now that the</text>
  <text start="421.67" dur="5.1">graffiti that is popping up all over the</text>
  <text start="423.44" dur="5.52">place is the two IP addresses anyone can</text>
  <text start="426.77" dur="4.56">use to circumvent the government&amp;#39;s ban</text>
  <text start="428.96" dur="7.169">and these numbers are Google&amp;#39;s pub</text>
  <text start="431.33" dur="10.559">DNS addresses which they can utilize</text>
  <text start="436.129" dur="9.961">Twitter through now we see Lavrov he is</text>
  <text start="441.889" dur="7.921">revealing the deal with the United</text>
  <text start="446.09" dur="6.09">States and we know that John Kerry has</text>
  <text start="449.81" dur="7.289">been meeting with Sergey Lavrov who is</text>
  <text start="452.18" dur="9.72">Russians foreign minister and the US has</text>
  <text start="457.099" dur="8.91">a demand a precondition demand for</text>
  <text start="461.9" dur="8.759">Russia for them to join forces to get</text>
  <text start="466.009" dur="7.351">rid of the Islamic state other terrorist</text>
  <text start="470.659" dur="6.211">groups but leave the moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="473.36" dur="6">which are still terrorists and the</text>
  <text start="476.87" dur="7.259">precondition deal that Lavrov has</text>
  <text start="479.36" dur="9.63">revealed is that Kerry wants the</text>
  <text start="484.129" dur="10.26">immediate resignation of President Assad</text>
  <text start="488.99" dur="8.94">and there will be no explanation of why</text>
  <text start="494.389" dur="7.321">this was done and then the United States</text>
  <text start="497.93" dur="9.81">will join forces with Russia and of</text>
  <text start="501.71" dur="8.79">course Lavrov again said listen the</text>
  <text start="507.74" dur="6.81">president will be elected in a</text>
  <text start="510.5" dur="7.62">democratic way the people will decide he</text>
  <text start="514.55" dur="6.479">also said that Western policy in the</text>
  <text start="518.12" dur="6.87">Middle East and North Africa is like a</text>
  <text start="521.029" dur="5.821">bull in a china shop now we can see that</text>
  <text start="524.99" dur="5.279">this has been the agenda of the United</text>
  <text start="526.85" dur="7.609">States all along they only want Assad</text>
  <text start="530.269" dur="8.401">gone this entire deal is based upon</text>
  <text start="534.459" dur="7.301">Assad being removed and right now Russia</text>
  <text start="538.67" dur="6.21">has said to them this is not going to</text>
  <text start="541.76" dur="7.53">happen and like I said in past reports</text>
  <text start="544.88" dur="6.269">the US has two options piece make a</text>
  <text start="549.29" dur="5.28">ceasefire deal and have peace with</text>
  <text start="551.149" dur="6.091">Russia join forces or do something else</text>
  <text start="554.57" dur="4.5">and it looks like we&amp;#39;re heading down</text>
  <text start="557.24" dur="3.719">that path where they&amp;#39;re about to do</text>
  <text start="559.07" dur="5.79">something else and what does that do</text>
  <text start="560.959" dur="8.581">something else that is to create an</text>
  <text start="564.86" dur="9.21">plan and push a major offensive in this</text>
  <text start="569.54" dur="7.68">area we might see an event we might see</text>
  <text start="574.07" dur="7.74">something occur for them to get back</text>
  <text start="577.22" dur="8.58">into this war now out in Germany we see</text>
  <text start="581.81" dur="5.31">that there was this unit shooter and of</text>
  <text start="585.8" dur="3.06">course the news was out there saying</text>
  <text start="587.12" dur="5.13">there&amp;#39;s six gunmen there&amp;#39;s seven gunmen</text>
  <text start="588.86" dur="7.83">and it turned out to be one an 18 year</text>
  <text start="592.25" dur="8.28">old male he was a student he was a</text>
  <text start="596.69" dur="7.4">German an Iranian citizen and the report</text>
  <text start="600.53" dur="6.66">is saying that he killed nine people 127</text>
  <text start="604.09" dur="5.65">very interestingly he did not use a long</text>
  <text start="607.19" dur="4.71">rifle he used a nine-millimeter Glock</text>
  <text start="609.74" dur="5.78">semi-automatic pistol this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="611.9" dur="7.02">coming out of the story from Germany and</text>
  <text start="615.52" dur="5.62">he was also receiving psychiatric and</text>
  <text start="618.92" dur="4.2">medical care to help him cope with</text>
  <text start="621.14" dur="5.51">depression so most likely he was on</text>
  <text start="623.12" dur="8.33">SSRIs and we know that these individuals</text>
  <text start="626.65" dur="7.21">who have who are mentally unstable</text>
  <text start="631.45" dur="7.36">usually get visit from high-ranking</text>
  <text start="633.86" dur="7.74">individuals who push them into doing</text>
  <text start="638.81" dur="6.08">things they normally wouldn&amp;#39;t do so they</text>
  <text start="641.6" dur="6">said he shot himself this is normal as</text>
  <text start="644.89" dur="7.27">these things go these false flag events</text>
  <text start="647.6" dur="6.75">and he has been looking at mass</text>
  <text start="652.16" dur="5.52">shootings now they have already ruled</text>
  <text start="654.35" dur="7.02">out any connection to the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="657.68" dur="5.31">which in Germany does make sense because</text>
  <text start="661.37" dur="3.66">they would not be able to go down this</text>
  <text start="662.99" dur="4.47">path because they would say the Islamic</text>
  <text start="665.03" dur="6.03">state came in with the refugees and</text>
  <text start="667.46" dur="5.49">there would be a huge backlash so</text>
  <text start="671.06" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re making it look like he was</text>
  <text start="672.95" dur="7.28">radicalized in the country he was</text>
  <text start="677.15" dur="10.43">studying mass shooting he was actually</text>
  <text start="680.23" dur="9.52">looking at a book entitled why kids kill</text>
  <text start="687.58" dur="5.62">describing the rationale behind school</text>
  <text start="689.75" dur="9">shootings documents on shooting sprees</text>
  <text start="693.2" dur="8.73">were found allegedly and of course these</text>
  <text start="698.75" dur="6.99">could have been planted he also was</text>
  <text start="701.93" dur="7.35">looking at Norway&amp;#39;s Anders Behring</text>
  <text start="705.74" dur="7.41">Breivik attacks where he murdered 77</text>
  <text start="709.28" dur="8.33">people and very interestingly out of all</text>
  <text start="713.15" dur="7.41">of this Chancellor Angela Merkel</text>
  <text start="717.61" dur="7.63">insisted that no one wants to live in a</text>
  <text start="720.56" dur="7.98">surveillance state but to protect the</text>
  <text start="725.24" dur="7.26">public to guarantee total public</text>
  <text start="728.54" dur="6.84">security this is the direction we might</text>
  <text start="732.5" dur="5.1">have to go and this is what the</text>
  <text start="735.38" dur="5.94">government&amp;#39;s the central bankers always</text>
  <text start="737.6" dur="6.69">do they go in this direction and we</text>
  <text start="741.32" dur="7.68">realize at this point that these things</text>
  <text start="744.29" dur="9.57">are planned their planned out to make</text>
  <text start="749" dur="6.93">sure the public understands that the</text>
  <text start="753.86" dur="4.47">danger is coming from the outside of the</text>
  <text start="755.93" dur="4.71">country from the Islamic state when they</text>
  <text start="758.33" dur="6.11">can use it and the danger is coming from</text>
  <text start="760.64" dur="8.01">inside because very interestingly that</text>
  <text start="764.44" dur="10.99">there&amp;#39;s this individual Richard to boot</text>
  <text start="768.65" dur="9.51">jar who just happened to be in Nice to</text>
  <text start="775.43" dur="9.02">film the beginning of this truck event</text>
  <text start="778.16" dur="9.75">and he was at the Olympia mole in Munich</text>
  <text start="784.45" dur="8.01">filming the event as it occurred and he</text>
  <text start="787.91" dur="8.49">had the perfect spots in both locations</text>
  <text start="792.46" dur="6.46">now is this a coincidence no it is not</text>
  <text start="796.4" dur="6.42">they wanted to make sure they had</text>
  <text start="798.92" dur="6.48">certain footage to show the public now</text>
  <text start="802.82" dur="5.91">very interestingly they use gun control</text>
  <text start="805.4" dur="4.98">to say if we have more of it it would</text>
  <text start="808.73" dur="4.68">stop all of these things now we know in</text>
  <text start="810.38" dur="6">the united states that all these mass</text>
  <text start="813.41" dur="6.87">shootings take place in these gun</text>
  <text start="816.38" dur="7.82">control free zones germany they have the</text>
  <text start="820.28" dur="8.04">most stringent rules around guns in</text>
  <text start="824.2" dur="6.43">europe to own a gun in Germany it is</text>
  <text start="828.32" dur="4.019">necessary to obtain a weapon license for</text>
  <text start="830.63" dur="1.98">which applicants must generally be at</text>
  <text start="832.339" dur="4.081">lea</text>
  <text start="832.61" dur="7.01">18 years old now this individual just so</text>
  <text start="836.42" dur="6.539">happened to be 18 years old and they</text>
