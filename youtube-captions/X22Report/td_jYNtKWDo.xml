  <text start="39.519" dur="5.081">2016 and the thought of the episode is</text>
  <text start="41.93" dur="4.47">the current economic collapse news brief</text>
  <text start="44.6" dur="4.099">let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="46.4" dur="5.58">collapse news when we talk about</text>
  <text start="48.699" dur="5.621">economies deteriorating we start to talk</text>
  <text start="51.98" dur="4.98">about different countries throughout</text>
  <text start="54.32" dur="5.04">Europe like Greece Cyprus we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="56.96" dur="5.64">about countries in South America like</text>
  <text start="59.36" dur="5.28">Venezuela Argentina Brazil and we see</text>
  <text start="62.6" dur="5.1">these countries imposing austerity on</text>
  <text start="64.64" dur="5.07">the people and we say this can never</text>
  <text start="67.7" dur="6.36">happen here in the United States it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="69.71" dur="6.12">impossible but that&amp;#39;s not the case we</text>
  <text start="74.06" dur="4.08">are already seeing it here in the United</text>
  <text start="75.83" dur="5.399">States now back in April we reported on</text>
  <text start="78.14" dur="4.86">the 407 thousand private-sector workers</text>
  <text start="81.229" dur="4.321">that are about to lose their pensions</text>
  <text start="83" dur="4.95">now this is one of the nation&amp;#39;s largest</text>
  <text start="85.55" dur="6.17">pension fund and they&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="87.95" dur="9.449">reduce benefits or go broke by 2025</text>
  <text start="91.72" dur="8.41">currently right now the plan pays out</text>
  <text start="97.399" dur="4.5">around three dot 46 cents in pension</text>
  <text start="100.13" dur="4.53">benefits for every one dollar received</text>
  <text start="101.899" dur="6.36">from employers that&amp;#39;s a drain of about 2</text>
  <text start="104.66" dur="6.45">billion annually the planned filed for</text>
  <text start="108.259" dur="4.5">sixty percent cuts in pensions now the</text>
  <text start="111.11" dur="4.2">Treasury Department they have the final</text>
  <text start="112.759" dur="4.2">say in this and the verdict came out</text>
  <text start="115.31" dur="6.3">from the Treasury Department saying</text>
  <text start="116.959" dur="6.78">these cuts are not deep enough we are</text>
  <text start="121.61" dur="4.8">looking at austerity here in the United</text>
  <text start="123.739" dur="4.621">States now normally when a</text>
  <text start="126.41" dur="4.2">multi-employer fund like Central States</text>
  <text start="128.36" dur="3.9">runs out of money a government insurance</text>
  <text start="130.61" dur="5.19">fund called the pension benefit guaranty</text>
  <text start="132.26" dur="7.55">corporation kicks in so the retirees</text>
  <text start="135.8" dur="7.31">will receive some kind of benefit well</text>
  <text start="139.81" dur="5.71">it&amp;#39;s not a good solution for one thing</text>
  <text start="143.11" dur="4.48">the amount is smaller than what</text>
  <text start="145.52" dur="4.65">pensioners would have received under the</text>
  <text start="147.59" dur="4.38">Central States reduction plan and is</text>
  <text start="150.17" dur="5.099">based on the number of years Avett</text>
  <text start="151.97" dur="5.94">re-worked a retiree would receive around</text>
  <text start="155.269" dur="4.261">35 dot 75 cents a month for each year</text>
  <text start="157.91" dur="5.97">worked according to the funds website</text>
  <text start="159.53" dur="6.12">and that&amp;#39;s about 1,000 $72 am</text>
  <text start="163.88" dur="4.47">for a retiree who worked about 30 years</text>
  <text start="165.65" dur="6.48">and there&amp;#39;s another problem the PBGC</text>
  <text start="168.35" dur="6">itself is underfunded and it will not be</text>
  <text start="172.13" dur="5.39">able to cover all the retirees in the</text>
  <text start="174.35" dur="6.93">central state pension fund so when</text>
  <text start="177.52" dur="7.41">private pension funds go broke they just</text>
  <text start="181.28" dur="6.15">go broke public pension funds with</text>
  <text start="184.93" dur="5.02">people who are working in a public</text>
  <text start="187.43" dur="7.59">office in the government they expect a</text>
  <text start="189.95" dur="8.01">bailout and we see right now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.02" dur="6.21">happening this is a form of austerity on</text>
  <text start="197.96" dur="5.16">the people just like we&amp;#39;re seeing out in</text>
  <text start="201.23" dur="5.88">Greece just like we&amp;#39;re seeing in France</text>
  <text start="203.12" dur="5.94">in Italy there&amp;#39;s absolutely no</text>
  <text start="207.11" dur="5.76">difference really now Citibank is out</text>
  <text start="209.06" dur="5.73">there and they are becoming more and</text>
  <text start="212.87" dur="5.43">more convinced that this entire system</text>
  <text start="214.79" dur="5.16">it just will not stabilize what they</text>
  <text start="218.3" dur="5.73">were actually saying is that the central</text>
  <text start="219.95" dur="6.02">banks they broke the market and this is</text>
  <text start="224.03" dur="5.94">exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="225.97" dur="6.34">that this system cannot stabilize the</text>
  <text start="229.97" dur="4.23">debt is way too high this is built up on</text>
  <text start="232.31" dur="4.53">an illusion everything has been</text>
  <text start="234.2" dur="6.72">manipulated and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="236.84" dur="7.68">now is a huge breakdown of the economies</text>
  <text start="240.92" dur="6.6">around the world and just like we</text>
  <text start="244.52" dur="5.34">reported on Friday we saw this death</text>
  <text start="247.52" dur="6.81">cross and the last time we saw this was</text>
  <text start="249.86" dur="7.95">in 2008 and it did not end well this is</text>
  <text start="254.33" dur="6.24">when the market came crumbling down it</text>
  <text start="257.81" dur="4.32">just imploded even though the Fed and</text>
  <text start="260.57" dur="3.45">the US government were telling us that</text>
  <text start="262.13" dur="4.71">their number they weren&amp;#39;t forecasting</text>
  <text start="264.02" dur="8.52">any type of recession we are at the same</text>
  <text start="266.84" dur="10.59">point once again now out in Venezuela we</text>
  <text start="272.54" dur="8.79">see that the u.s. is pushing a coup just</text>
  <text start="277.43" dur="5.31">like in Brazil and what we&amp;#39;re seeing in</text>
  <text start="281.33" dur="3.47">Venezuela is very interesting because</text>
  <text start="282.74" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re seeing hyperinflation right now</text>
  <text start="284.8" dur="4.75">right now they&amp;#39;re seeing about a hundred</text>
  <text start="286.97" dur="4.47">and eighty percent inflation some</text>
  <text start="289.55" dur="3.27">private sector sources are estimating</text>
  <text start="291.44" dur="2.97">that the inflation is around three</text>
  <text start="292.82" dur="4.83">hundred and thirty percent and it looks</text>
  <text start="294.41" dur="5.069">like the u.s. is using economic warfare</text>
  <text start="297.65" dur="4.17">this point and the main effects of</text>
  <text start="299.479" dur="5.81">hyperinflation they are being felt in</text>
  <text start="301.82" dur="6.629">the country during the time between</text>
  <text start="305.289" dur="6.13">receipt of tax revenues and actually</text>
  <text start="308.449" dur="5.551">putting these taxes to use inflation</text>
  <text start="311.419" dur="5.571">eats up the real value providing the</text>
  <text start="314" dur="7.289">government with less real revenue and</text>
  <text start="316.99" dur="7.44">because of this Venezuela might have to</text>
  <text start="321.289" dur="6.511">move to the dollar very interesting</text>
  <text start="324.43" dur="7.03">because what we see happening right now</text>
  <text start="327.8" dur="10.11">it looks like the u.s. is really pushing</text>
  <text start="331.46" dur="9.269">hard trying to get Venezuela to get on</text>
  <text start="337.91" dur="6.42">the dollar system and use it as their</text>
  <text start="340.729" dur="6.511">currency they&amp;#39;re trying to remove the</text>
  <text start="344.33" dur="4.8">leader of this country just like in</text>
  <text start="347.24" dur="4.35">Brazil just like an Argentine just like</text>
  <text start="349.13" dur="5.159">in Ukraine just like in all of these</text>
  <text start="351.59" dur="5.37">different countries because eventually</text>
  <text start="354.289" dur="4.951">what they want to do is they want to set</text>
  <text start="356.96" dur="5.85">up a system where all their natural</text>
  <text start="359.24" dur="5.7">resources oil is being sold using the</text>
  <text start="362.81" dur="4.65">dollar and we can see this is exactly</text>
  <text start="364.94" dur="6.84">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do at this point</text>
  <text start="367.46" dur="6.989">in this country now we talk a lot about</text>
  <text start="371.78" dur="4.56">the NSA spying on the people the FBI</text>
  <text start="374.449" dur="3.84">spying on the people CIA spying on the</text>
  <text start="376.34" dur="3.48">people and like I said everyone needs to</text>
  <text start="378.289" dur="3.151">protect themselves anyway they possibly</text>
  <text start="379.82" dur="4.379">can and I know there are some cases</text>
  <text start="381.44" dur="5.94">where you just can&amp;#39;t do it but wherever</text>
  <text start="384.199" dur="7.801">you can you need to protect yourself you</text>
  <text start="387.38" dur="8.24">need to use encryption you need to use</text>
  <text start="392" dur="6.3">products like block apakah calm it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="395.62" dur="4.06">sleeve which is intertwined with metals</text>
  <text start="398.3" dur="2.85">you can slip your phone into it you can</text>
  <text start="399.68" dur="3.33">slip your credit card into it and it</text>
  <text start="401.15" dur="4.799">blocks the signal so it can&amp;#39;t be tracked</text>
  <text start="403.01" dur="6.51">or they can&amp;#39;t steal your information you</text>
  <text start="405.949" dur="6.601">need to use encrypted email make sure</text>
  <text start="409.52" dur="5.16">you have spyware software virus software</text>
  <text start="412.55" dur="4.679">on your computer and there are certain</text>
  <text start="414.68" dur="5.489">times when all of this doesn&amp;#39;t help at</text>
  <text start="417.229" dur="4.951">all but at least you&amp;#39;re doing something</text>
  <text start="420.169" dur="3.481">to make it very difficult for the</text>
  <text start="422.18" dur="3.39">government because what we just found</text>
  <text start="423.65" dur="7.69">out and we kind of knew this from the</text>
  <text start="425.57" dur="10.74">past is that the NSA they have back</text>
  <text start="431.34" dur="8.03">doors in the firmware of hard drives</text>
  <text start="436.31" dur="7.21">which means that every device is</text>
  <text start="439.37" dur="6.01">compromised and we know what happens</text>
  <text start="443.52" dur="4.47">when there&amp;#39;s a back door not just the</text>
  <text start="445.38" dur="5.58">NSA will find it actual hackers and</text>
  <text start="447.99" dur="4.95">criminals will find this backdoor so if</text>
  <text start="450.96" dur="5.94">you really think about it they have</text>
  <text start="452.94" dur="5.88">access to everyone&amp;#39;s computer and this</text>
  <text start="456.9" dur="3.48">is very worrying not just for the</text>
  <text start="458.82" dur="4.08">individual but think about the</text>
  <text start="460.38" dur="4.95">corporation&amp;#39;s think about other</text>
  <text start="462.9" dur="4.8">countries actually this is why China and</text>
  <text start="465.33" dur="4.14">Russia decided you know something we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="467.7" dur="4.23">not going to use any products or any</text>
  <text start="469.47" dur="4.8">chips from the United States in our</text>
  <text start="471.93" dur="3.78">systems because we don&amp;#39;t know if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="474.27" dur="3.93">a back door and if you really think</text>
  <text start="475.71" dur="7.23">about this the entire concept of</text>
  <text start="478.2" dur="6.39">computer security is undermined by these</text>
  <text start="482.94" dur="5.31">different agencies here in the United</text>
  <text start="484.59" dur="7.41">States because they&amp;#39;re leaving holes in</text>
  <text start="488.25" dur="5.669">each and every one of our systems now</text>
  <text start="492" dur="4.53">the United Nations Security Council they</text>
  <text start="493.919" dur="5.37">want a global framework for censoring</text>
  <text start="496.53" dur="4.02">the internet that&amp;#39;s right censoring the</text>
  <text start="499.289" dur="3.901">internet of course they&amp;#39;re using it</text>
  <text start="500.55" dur="6.69">under the guise of you know countering</text>
  <text start="503.19" dur="8.479">terrorism and they&amp;#39;re going to use it</text>
  <text start="507.24" dur="9.03">for countering government propaganda</text>
  <text start="511.669" dur="8.081">online propaganda hateful ideologies</text>
  <text start="516.27" dur="4.98">digital terrorism and to that end the UN</text>
  <text start="519.75" dur="3.959">Security Council this week ordered the</text>
  <text start="521.25" dur="6.18">UN counterterrorism committee to draw up</text>
  <text start="523.709" dur="5.671">a plan by next year now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="527.43" dur="4.77">seeing right now is it looks like</text>
  <text start="529.38" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re taking control of what can be</text>
  <text start="532.2" dur="4.98">said on the internet now there are</text>
  <text start="535.77" dur="5.55">companies like Google Microsoft Yahoo</text>
  <text start="537.18" dur="9.21">and other tech giant&amp;#39;s have embraced the</text>
  <text start="541.32" dur="8.15">UN energy genda for this which we know</text>
  <text start="546.39" dur="7.35">what&amp;#39;s going to happen once the UN</text>
  <text start="549.47" dur="8.08">decides what can be said what can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="553.74" dur="5.52">said it&amp;#39;s no longer free speech it&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="557.55" dur="5.36">longer eight you can say whatever you</text>
  <text start="559.26" dur="5.82">want it&amp;#39;s permitted speech and what is</text>
  <text start="562.91" dur="4.18">acceptable in one</text>
  <text start="565.08" dur="4.59">Ultra might not be acceptable in another</text>
  <text start="567.09" dur="4.83">culture some people might be offended in</text>
  <text start="569.67" dur="4.98">a different culture and when you start</text>
  <text start="571.92" dur="5.61">doing this and you start policing what</text>
  <text start="574.65" dur="5.76">people are saying we&amp;#39;re going down a</text>
  <text start="577.53" dur="5.04">path where we&amp;#39;re really not allowed to</text>
  <text start="580.41" dur="4.74">say whatever we want we&amp;#39;re only allowed</text>
  <text start="582.57" dur="6.78">to say what they want and this is what</text>
  <text start="585.15" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;re trying to do and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="589.35" dur="5.19">have to watch this situation very very</text>
  <text start="591" dur="6.3">carefully no out in Ukraine we see</text>
  <text start="594.54" dur="4.53">poroshenko he is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="597.3" dur="4.8">the only way to get the southeastern</text>
  <text start="599.07" dur="4.98">area back is through peaceful means now</text>
  <text start="602.1" dur="3.36">of course we know Victoria Nuland was in</text>
  <text start="604.05" dur="3.78">Russia talking about the mins to cease</text>
  <text start="605.46" dur="5.13">fire agreement then all of a sudden we</text>
  <text start="607.83" dur="4.2">had the protests in ukraine where they</text>
  <text start="610.59" dur="2.91">want poroshenko to step down because</text>
  <text start="612.03" dur="3.39">they don&amp;#39;t want a peaceful answer to</text>
  <text start="613.5" dur="4.47">this they know if they go down the</text>
  <text start="615.42" dur="4.02">peaceful route they know that the</text>
  <text start="617.97" dur="5.07">southeastern people are not going to be</text>
  <text start="619.44" dur="6.75">brought back into Ukraine the central</text>
  <text start="623.04" dur="5.91">banker system the US government they</text>
  <text start="626.19" dur="4.71">want full control of the entire country</text>
  <text start="628.95" dur="4.11">this is what they paid for it was like</text>
  <text start="630.9" dur="3.81">six billion dollars or so and this is</text>
  <text start="633.06" dur="4.92">why we&amp;#39;re seeing protest so I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="634.71" dur="7.08">be too surprised if poroshenko is</text>
  <text start="637.98" dur="6.5">actually removed somehow some way and</text>
  <text start="641.79" dur="6.15">this is something that we need to watch</text>
  <text start="644.48" dur="6.97">we see that the EU they have extended</text>
  <text start="647.94" dur="6.87">their sanctions against Crimea we also</text>
  <text start="651.45" dur="6.78">see that NATO announced a meeting in</text>
  <text start="654.81" dur="6.23">July and they didn&amp;#39;t consult Moscow they</text>
  <text start="658.23" dur="6.6">didn&amp;#39;t speak to the Government of Russia</text>
  <text start="661.04" dur="5.29">they excluded them so you can see the</text>
  <text start="664.83" dur="5.1">path that we&amp;#39;re heading down at this</text>
  <text start="666.33" dur="8.01">point now out in Libya the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="669.93" dur="9.33">preparing to deploy more military assets</text>
  <text start="674.34" dur="8.67">and more troops in this area and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="679.26" dur="5.52">waiting for the government in Libya to</text>
  <text start="683.01" dur="3.48">give the okay and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="684.78" dur="4.92">the joint chief of staff chairman</text>
  <text start="686.49" dur="5.34">General Joseph Dunford and they&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="689.7" dur="4.83">the verge of closing a deal that would</text>
  <text start="691.83" dur="6.75">require a long-term commitment of troops</text>
  <text start="694.53" dur="4.41">to Libya and US troops have already been</text>
  <text start="698.58" dur="2.46">headed</text>
  <text start="698.94" dur="5.46">Olivia since December which we</text>
  <text start="701.04" dur="5.52">continually report on because we know</text>
