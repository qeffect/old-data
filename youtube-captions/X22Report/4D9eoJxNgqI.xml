  <text start="116.899" dur="4.621">many other countries they are looking at</text>
  <text start="119.21" dur="5.22">what is happening right now because they</text>

  <text start="124.43" dur="4.32">marine lepen she said if she wins</text>
  <text start="126.59" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re following in the footsteps of</text>

  <text start="139.01" dur="3.75">just these two countries it&amp;#39;s the rest</text>
  <text start="141.019" dur="3.661">of Europe that is looking at the</text>
  <text start="142.76" dur="4.259">situation saying okay of those two are</text>
  <text start="144.68" dur="4.559">out guess what we&amp;#39;re not going to stay</text>
  <text start="147.019" dur="4.621">in because it makes no sense for us to</text>
  <text start="149.239" dur="3.511">stay in and we can see many countries</text>
  <text start="151.64" dur="3.03">would like to go back to their own</text>
  <text start="152.75" dur="4.1">currency many countries would like to</text>
  <text start="154.67" dur="6.569">take control of their own borders and</text>
  <text start="156.85" dur="6.82">right now we can see that the EU their</text>
  <text start="161.239" dur="3.84">days are numbered right now and we can</text>
  <text start="163.67" dur="3.27">see that whole entire system is going to</text>
  <text start="165.079" dur="4.051">be falling apart now we have a lot of</text>
  <text start="166.94" dur="5.609">things that are happening all at once</text>
  <text start="169.13" dur="5.76">because if the EU starts to decline and</text>
  <text start="172.549" dur="4.831">go down when as more and more countries</text>
  <text start="174.89" dur="3.779">leave it&amp;#39;s going to affect the rest of</text>
  <text start="177.38" dur="3.66">the world because everything is</text>
  <text start="178.669" dur="4.561">interconnected the banks in the US</text>
  <text start="181.04" dur="3.929">are interconnected with the EU ever</text>
  <text start="183.23" dur="4.41">going to have a major problem</text>
  <text start="184.969" dur="4.11">now when Trump is running during the</text>

  <text start="287.72" dur="4.29">continually moves higher and higher and</text>
  <text start="290.24" dur="3.78">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is the</text>
  <text start="292.01" dur="4.08">Fed is going to lose control of this I</text>
  <text start="294.02" dur="5.04">mean we&amp;#39;ve seen inflation in many other</text>

  <text start="314.42" dur="5.31">the inflation everywhere and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="316.4" dur="6.21">to hit much harder now alarm bells are</text>
  <text start="319.73" dur="4.86">starting to ring across multiple asset</text>
  <text start="322.61" dur="4.35">classes as we approach the feds first</text>
  <text start="324.59" dur="5.88">double rate hike in three months since</text>
  <text start="326.96" dur="4.86">2006 and the most concerning is the</text>
  <text start="330.47" dur="3.27">credit markets we know the credit</text>
  <text start="331.82" dur="4.71">impulse was below zero in the negative</text>
  <text start="333.74" dur="4.83">range we know China has been pushing the</text>
  <text start="336.53" dur="4.89">credit market up and China right now</text>
  <text start="338.57" dur="4.62">well they&amp;#39;re seeing slower growth at</text>
  <text start="341.42" dur="4.89">this point Robert Shiller is out there</text>
  <text start="343.19" dur="6.09">saying that a stock market well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="346.31" dur="4.71">starting to look like it&amp;#39;s 2000 and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="349.28" dur="3.63">saying it&amp;#39;s the end of the bull market</text>
  <text start="351.02" dur="4.23">Shiller says when the markets are</text>
  <text start="352.91" dur="4.8">buoyant as they are now resisting the</text>
  <text start="355.25" dur="4.08">urge to pile in is hard regardless of</text>
  <text start="357.71" dur="4.59">what else might be happening in society</text>
  <text start="359.33" dur="4.91">one factor that makes him very cautious</text>
  <text start="362.3" dur="4.71">on American chairs as the S&amp;amp;P 500</text>
  <text start="364.24" dur="4.72">cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio</text>
  <text start="367.01" dur="4.76">while the metric is still about 30</text>
  <text start="368.96" dur="5.97">percent below its high in 2000 it shows</text>
  <text start="371.77" dur="6.75">stocks are almost as expensive now as</text>
  <text start="374.93" dur="5.91">they were on the eve of the 1929 crash</text>
  <text start="378.52" dur="5.44">and we can see during the dot-com bubble</text>
  <text start="380.84" dur="5.97">stocks were very expensive so to sum up</text>
  <text start="383.96" dur="6.38">what mr. Schiller is saying the market</text>
  <text start="386.81" dur="6.36">is way overpriced it&amp;#39;s not as</text>
  <text start="390.34" dur="4.69">intellectual as people would think or as</text>
  <text start="393.17" dur="4.38">an economist would have you believe and</text>
  <text start="395.03" dur="5.31">he believes that it&amp;#39;s coming down many</text>
  <text start="397.55" dur="4.83">people do many people see that the stock</text>
  <text start="400.34" dur="3">market it has reached its height maybe</text>
  <text start="402.38" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;ll move up with just a little bit</text>
  <text start="403.34" dur="4.32">more but we see the smart money starting</text>
  <text start="405.98" dur="4.41">to move out of the market and the retail</text>
  <text start="407.66" dur="4.98">investors to move in we also see that</text>
  <text start="410.39" dur="5.13">corporations they&amp;#39;re slowing their</text>
  <text start="412.64" dur="4.56">purchases of stock at this point now</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="3.45">they haven&amp;#39;t stopped completely but you</text>
  <text start="417.2" dur="4.35">can see the pace they are definitely</text>
  <text start="418.97" dur="5.64">slowing now just before I mention that</text>
  <text start="421.55" dur="6.09">China they are suffering the worst start</text>
  <text start="424.61" dur="5.85">to a year for retail sales since 2002</text>
  <text start="427.64" dur="5.43">and with its credit impulse wearing off</text>
  <text start="430.46" dur="4.53">and inflation spikes stalling any hopes</text>
  <text start="433.07" dur="4.95">of renewed stimulus anytime soon it</text>
  <text start="434.99" dur="5.73">appears that China&amp;#39;s always happy</text>
  <text start="438.02" dur="6">consumer is not so happy in the</text>
  <text start="440.72" dur="5.34">beginning of 2017 and this is going to</text>
  <text start="444.02" dur="4.32">have a ripple effect throughout the</text>
  <text start="446.06" dur="4.109">world now against expectations</text>
  <text start="448.34" dur="4.37">about ten point six year-over-year gain</text>
  <text start="450.169" dur="5.311">in a year today cumulative retail sales</text>
  <text start="452.71" dur="4.69">february well it dropped down to nine</text>
  <text start="455.48" dur="4.29">point five percent and again</text>
  <text start="457.4" dur="6.03">this is week and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="459.77" dur="6.899">that the growth of China is slowing and</text>
  <text start="463.43" dur="5.76">this is going to be a major problem now</text>
  <text start="466.669" dur="5.011">right now we know the US economy is weak</text>
  <text start="469.19" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s very weak but the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="471.68" dur="4.92">is planning to raise interest rates</text>
  <text start="473.36" dur="5.52">anyway into a weak economy now we know</text>
  <text start="476.6" dur="4.62">what happened in 1937 it didn&amp;#39;t end well</text>
  <text start="478.88" dur="4.05">and according to the length of Fed the</text>
  <text start="481.22" dur="4.23">US economy is expected to grow and</text>
  <text start="482.93" dur="4.53">around 2.8 percent then they revised</text>
  <text start="485.45" dur="4.86">down now they&amp;#39;re down to one point two</text>
  <text start="487.46" dur="5.07">percent so the economy is not doing as</text>
  <text start="490.31" dur="4.5">well as everyone thinks and this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="492.53" dur="5.4">the kind of environment where the Fed</text>
  <text start="494.81" dur="5.4">typically raises rates so why is the Fed</text>
  <text start="497.93" dur="5.4">raising rates when the economy is</text>
  <text start="500.21" dur="5.01">crawling along at sub-optimal speed and</text>
  <text start="503.33" dur="4.02">perhaps headed for a recession I think</text>
  <text start="505.22" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;re already in a recession because</text>
  <text start="507.35" dur="4.439">we&amp;#39;re already seeing indicators and</text>
  <text start="509.36" dur="3.299">signs that show us that we&amp;#39;re already in</text>
  <text start="511.789" dur="3.24">this recession</text>
  <text start="512.659" dur="4.62">well the Trump bump has been the biggest</text>
  <text start="515.029" dur="4.741">post-election day rally in Wall Street</text>
  <text start="517.279" dur="4.801">history and the promise of giant tax</text>

  <text start="551.029" dur="5.041">about trillions of dollars in equity in</text>

  <text start="556.07" dur="4.98">avoid that type of scenario and this is</text>
  <text start="559.19" dur="5.07">why the Fed is expected to gradually</text>

  <text start="569.87" dur="3.62">know what will happen right off the bat</text>
  <text start="571.79" dur="4.44">and who would we would be responsible</text>
  <text start="573.49" dur="5.11">well the central bank because again</text>
  <text start="576.23" dur="4.5">Trump hasn&amp;#39;t done anything yet so the</text>
  <text start="578.6" dur="3.51">Fed has a repeatedly expressed</text>

  <text start="599.959" dur="5.101">it will also undercut prospects for</text>
  <text start="602.57" dur="4.68">stronger growth but why would Yellen</text>
  <text start="605.06" dur="4.529">want to foil a plan that would result</text>
  <text start="607.25" dur="5.16">into stronger growth and help the</text>
  <text start="609.589" dur="4.921">American people and bring jobs back it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="612.41" dur="3.81">because stronger growth means higher</text>

  <text start="616.22" dur="6.33">yellen&amp;#39;s buddies in the bond market will</text>
  <text start="619.579" dur="5.371">get absolutely pulverized if GDP picks</text>
  <text start="622.55" dur="4.74">up and Trump achieves his goal of 4%</text>
  <text start="624.95" dur="3.9">growth which he&amp;#39;s never going to reach</text>
  <text start="627.29" dur="3.33">he&amp;#39;s not even going to come close</text>
  <text start="628.85" dur="4.56">because we could see already the first</text>
  <text start="630.62" dur="4.649">quarter is at 1.2 percent and most of</text>
  <text start="633.41" dur="4.44">the manufacturing jobs and other jobs</text>
  <text start="635.269" dur="4.831">are offshored and we don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="637.85" dur="4.77">infrastructure right now to bring them</text>
  <text start="640.1" dur="5.429">all back it all has to be built and even</text>
  <text start="642.62" dur="6.149">with a 1 trillion plan it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="645.529" dur="5.701">work and another thing the Fed will not</text>
  <text start="648.769" dur="5.281">let it happen anyhow so we see that</text>
  <text start="651.23" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;re moving towards this period of time</text>
  <text start="654.05" dur="5.399">where Trump wants to do all these things</text>
  <text start="656" dur="7.23">and tomorrow March 15th we have the debt</text>
  <text start="659.449" dur="6">ceiling problem and all of a sudden we</text>
  <text start="663.23" dur="4.59">have major problems in this country not</text>
  <text start="665.449" dur="3.781">right off the bat but going forward if</text>
  <text start="667.82" dur="3.93">nothing is done with the debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="669.23" dur="4.08">well it&amp;#39;s going to ramp up pretty darn</text>
  <text start="671.75" dur="5.25">fast now David Stockman</text>
  <text start="673.31" dur="6.57">has said that the US Treasury has funds</text>
  <text start="677" dur="5.279">of about 435 billion of cash and that</text>
  <text start="679.88" dur="4.769">was because the individuals in</text>
  <text start="682.279" dur="4.201">government well they were piling it on</text>
  <text start="684.649" dur="6.091">because they thought Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="686.48" dur="7.71">would be in office and she would have to</text>
  <text start="690.74" dur="5.7">kind of convince Congress to raise the</text>
  <text start="694.19" dur="5.79">debt ceiling but now we have Trump in</text>
  <text start="696.44" dur="6.42">office and the US Treasuries cash word</text>
  <text start="699.98" dur="5.52">well it kind of disappeared they spent</text>
  <text start="702.86" dur="4.56">all the money the daily Treasury</text>
  <text start="705.5" dur="6.079">statements from March 7th the cash</text>
  <text start="707.42" dur="7.14">balance was down to 88 billion meaning</text>
  <text start="711.579" dur="4.781">347 billion of cash has flown out the</text>
  <text start="714.56" dur="4.259">door since October 21</text>
  <text start="716.36" dur="4.86">and on March 8th alone the Treasury</text>
  <text start="718.819" dur="5.25">consumed another 22 billion of cash</text>
  <text start="721.22" dur="5.789">bringing the balance down to 66 billion</text>
  <text start="724.069" dur="5.31">during that 47 day period the Treasury</text>
  <text start="727.009" dur="5.07">took the opportunity to pay down fifty</text>
  <text start="729.379" dur="5.281">seven billion of maturing Treasury bills</text>
  <text start="732.079" dur="5.73">and notes by tapping its cash hoard they</text>
  <text start="734.66" dur="6.419">drained the 294 billion from the bank</text>
  <text start="737.809" dur="6.15">account of the Treasury or about 6.4</text>
  <text start="741.079" dur="5.641">billion per day and here we are at March</text>
  <text start="743.959" dur="5.461">15th already and the Treasury will be</text>
  <text start="746.72" dur="4.409">out of cash by Memorial Day that means</text>
  <text start="749.42" dur="5.219">they&amp;#39;ll not even be a glimmer of hope</text>
  <text start="751.129" dur="6.541">for any type of tax stimulus economic</text>
  <text start="754.639" dur="6.05">rebound it means they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="757.67" dur="5.94">to raise the debt ceiling or the country</text>
  <text start="760.689" dur="4.51">defaults so we can see where we are</text>
  <text start="763.61" dur="3.959">headed right now we&amp;#39;re at a crossroads</text>
  <text start="765.199" dur="5.521">do they kick the can down the street and</text>
  <text start="767.569" dur="6">add more debt which eventually is going</text>
  <text start="770.72" dur="5.219">to hurt us even further or do they take</text>
  <text start="773.569" dur="4.74">the pain now and say you know something</text>
  <text start="775.939" dur="4.95">we need to default what is happening now</text>
  <text start="778.309" dur="5.25">is not working now Trump has done this</text>
  <text start="780.889" dur="5.13">before with businesses and he knows how</text>
  <text start="783.559" dur="3.39">far he can take it until he says okay</text>
  <text start="786.019" dur="3.841">enough is enough</text>
  <text start="786.949" dur="5.7">we just can&amp;#39;t go on we know tax receipts</text>
  <text start="789.86" dur="5.789">are continually falling more and more</text>
  <text start="792.649" dur="4.951">individuals are losing work jobs really</text>
  <text start="795.649" dur="6.03">haven&amp;#39;t been created where under the</text>
  <text start="797.6" dur="5.969">manipulation of the BLS under Obama</text>
  <text start="801.679" dur="4.08">we&amp;#39;re not even looking at the real</text>
  <text start="803.569" dur="4.68">numbers we will know because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="805.759" dur="6.18">going to have arguments discussions</text>
  <text start="808.249" dur="6">going past March 15th going into maybe</text>
  <text start="811.939" dur="4.111">April I&amp;#39;d be shocked if they just say</text>
  <text start="814.249" dur="4.94">okay let&amp;#39;s just raise it I mean during</text>
  <text start="816.05" dur="5.849">the campaign Trump was very angry at</text>
  <text start="819.189" dur="4.99">Congress for increasing the debt level</text>
  <text start="821.899" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;ll have to see what he does now so</text>
  <text start="824.179" dur="6.39">we&amp;#39;re at a point right now where things</text>
  <text start="826.939" dur="5.64">are rapidly accelerating we have</text>
  <text start="830.569" dur="5.01">individuals like Stockman I just</text>

  <text start="847.189" dur="4.441">the entire system might come to ace</text>
  <text start="849.83" dur="4.26">screeching halt and if the debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="851.63" dur="6.63">is raised we still have a problem</text>
  <text start="854.09" dur="8.76">because the world growth it&amp;#39;s declining</text>
  <text start="858.26" dur="7.62">the credit impulse is below zero China</text>
