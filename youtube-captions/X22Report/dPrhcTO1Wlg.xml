  <text start="37.199" dur="4.29">collapse news brief for this saturday</text>
  <text start="39.059" dur="5.07">and what do we know well we know the US</text>
  <text start="41.489" dur="5.85">government is going around looking for</text>
  <text start="44.129" dur="5.191">revenue and they&amp;#39;re looking in inside</text>
  <text start="47.339" dur="3.75">the United States and they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="49.32" dur="4.169">around the world they are making deals</text>
  <text start="51.089" dur="4.801">with every single country to report</text>
  <text start="53.489" dur="6.39">those individuals who are not claiming</text>
  <text start="55.89" dur="7.349">their income even if those people are</text>
  <text start="59.879" dur="6.451">working in another country and hold a US</text>
  <text start="63.239" dur="6.661">passport they still have to pay tax on</text>
  <text start="66.33" dur="6.389">that income so what&amp;#39;s happening right</text>
  <text start="69.9" dur="5.219">now is many people are saying you know</text>
  <text start="72.719" dur="5.01">what this is ridiculous I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="75.119" dur="7.591">turn in my passport and no longer be a</text>
  <text start="77.729" dur="7.911">US citizen and right now 2900 99 people</text>
  <text start="82.71" dur="6.089">have renounced their US citizenship in</text>
  <text start="85.64" dur="6.67">2013 now this is much much higher</text>
  <text start="88.799" dur="5.521">because in 2011 only 1700 people</text>
  <text start="92.31" dur="4.349">renounce their citizenship and if we</text>
  <text start="94.32" dur="4.17">look back in time we go back to nineteen</text>
  <text start="96.659" dur="5.82">ninety-eight we&amp;#39;re looking at only</text>
  <text start="98.49" dur="6.33">around 400 people so it is increasing</text>
  <text start="102.479" dur="4.38">exponentially and it is getting and more</text>
  <text start="104.82" dur="5.999">and more people are starting to realize</text>
  <text start="106.859" dur="6.69">what is going on here because again the</text>
  <text start="110.819" dur="4.65">debt cannot be sustained and this is why</text>
  <text start="113.549" dur="6.301">the government is looking all over the</text>
  <text start="115.469" dur="6">place to get the revenue to pay for this</text>
  <text start="119.85" dur="3.899">debt but you know what they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="121.469" dur="5.551">to find what they&amp;#39;re looking for because</text>
  <text start="123.749" dur="5.851">the people out there are unemployed they</text>
  <text start="127.02" dur="5.22">just don&amp;#39;t have the money and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="129.6" dur="5.28">going on now is more and more people or</text>
  <text start="132.24" dur="4.829">have no work and even if they do have</text>
  <text start="134.88" dur="5.76">work they are working part time they are</text>
  <text start="137.069" dur="5.641">not making the salaries that they were</text>
  <text start="140.64" dur="4.05">couple years ago actually salaries have</text>
  <text start="142.71" dur="3.99">been going down the in the opposite</text>
  <text start="144.69" dur="4.23">direction as things get more expensive</text>
  <text start="146.7" dur="4.32">so what they&amp;#39;re looking for is not what</text>
  <text start="148.92" dur="4.289">they&amp;#39;re going to find and this is why</text>
  <text start="151.02" dur="5.01">they they&amp;#39;ve created these bail-in</text>
  <text start="153.209" dur="6">documents throughout Europe in Canada</text>
  <text start="156.03" dur="5.429">Australia the UK and America because</text>
  <text start="159.209" dur="4.141">they realize when everything completely</text>
  <text start="161.459" dur="5.221">falls apart they will have to raid</text>
  <text start="163.35" dur="5.4">everyone&amp;#39;s savings account in the banks</text>
  <text start="166.68" dur="4.74">and this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing this happen</text>
  <text start="168.75" dur="4.65">here now we must be getting close to</text>
  <text start="171.42" dur="5.4">something because this is the fourth</text>
  <text start="173.4" dur="5.97">executive found dead now from and this</text>
  <text start="176.82" dur="5.58">one was a self-inflicted nail gun wound</text>
  <text start="179.37" dur="5.16">this is Richard tally founder and CEO of</text>
  <text start="182.4" dur="5">American Title was found dead in his</text>
  <text start="184.53" dur="5.88">home from self-inflicted wounds and</text>
  <text start="187.4" dur="5.74">we&amp;#39;ve seen three other bankers who&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="190.41" dur="4.77">committed suicide allegedly clip</text>
  <text start="193.14" dur="4.11">committed suicide so something must be</text>
  <text start="195.18" dur="5.22">going on and there are reports around</text>
  <text start="197.25" dur="5.55">that the hit is out and more bankers are</text>
  <text start="200.4" dur="4.86">going to be committing suicide actually</text>
  <text start="202.8" dur="6.15">being knocked off so they can&amp;#39;t testify</text>
  <text start="205.26" dur="5.85">and they can&amp;#39;t report what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="208.95" dur="3.69">going on so they start removing these</text>
  <text start="211.11" dur="4.379">individuals and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="212.64" dur="6.03">seeing right now now we understand that</text>
  <text start="215.489" dur="6.151">every single American is being spied on</text>
  <text start="218.67" dur="6.629">by the NSA we understand that other</text>
  <text start="221.64" dur="6.659">countries have these programs and we</text>
  <text start="225.299" dur="6.091">have to remember what these spy agencies</text>
  <text start="228.299" dur="5.491">do they use dirty tricks like spying on</text>
  <text start="231.39" dur="4.26">the porn habits of a non terrorist and</text>
  <text start="233.79" dur="6.06">then trying to leak them to discredit</text>
  <text start="235.65" dur="5.97">those non terrorist individuals and the</text>
  <text start="239.85" dur="3.96">United States is not the only country</text>
  <text start="241.62" dur="8.52">that does this the UK does this with</text>
  <text start="243.81" dur="9.92">their GCHQ spying organization and they</text>
  <text start="250.14" dur="6.659">have an agenda which goes ahead and</text>
  <text start="253.73" dur="5.65">pretty much sets up a honey trap for</text>
  <text start="256.799" dur="5.071">these people it changes their photos on</text>
  <text start="259.38" dur="4.289">social networking sites it writes a blog</text>
  <text start="261.87" dur="3.84">purporting to be one of their victims</text>
  <text start="263.669" dur="4.62">and then email text or colleagues</text>
  <text start="265.71" dur="5.82">neighbors and friends and when it comes</text>
  <text start="268.289" dur="4.861">to companies they go even further they</text>
  <text start="271.53" dur="2.77">look to leaked confidential information</text>
  <text start="273.15" dur="4.18">to the companies</text>
  <text start="274.3" dur="5.91">post- information on appropriate forms</text>
  <text start="277.33" dur="5.64">and stop deals and ruin business</text>
  <text start="280.21" dur="7.59">relationships so we can see that all</text>
  <text start="282.97" dur="8.25">these spy agencies are completely into</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="6.75">destroying people&amp;#39;s lives to get their</text>
  <text start="291.22" dur="4.59">agenda pushed forward and you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="294.55" dur="3.78">seeing this all over the place and of</text>
  <text start="295.81" dur="3.87">course you know it&amp;#39;s very hard to</text>
  <text start="298.33" dur="3.36">believe it actually sounds like it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="299.68" dur="4.139">movie that you&amp;#39;re watching but this is</text>
  <text start="301.69" dur="4.77">happening in real life and this is</text>
  <text start="303.819" dur="5.671">what&amp;#39;s happening today they are going</text>
  <text start="306.46" dur="5.81">around creating stories the news</text>
  <text start="309.49" dur="6.78">organizations are telling you completely</text>
  <text start="312.27" dur="6.94">non fact fictional stories to promote</text>
  <text start="316.27" dur="6.57">the entire government&amp;#39;s agenda and</text>
  <text start="319.21" dur="6">really what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now that</text>
  <text start="322.84" dur="4.199">since nine eleven actually going back</text>
  <text start="325.21" dur="5.009">further than that they&amp;#39;ve told us a</text>
  <text start="327.039" dur="6.201">story about terrorism and terrorists and</text>
  <text start="330.219" dur="7.141">this is to bring every single person and</text>
  <text start="333.24" dur="6.579">keep them controlled and the US</text>
  <text start="337.36" dur="5.1">government has long used anti-terror</text>
  <text start="339.819" dur="5.701">laws to crush dissent and protect the</text>
  <text start="342.46" dur="5.73">powers that be these programs were never</text>
  <text start="345.52" dur="5.959">about terrorism they were about economic</text>
  <text start="348.19" dur="5.99">spying social control and diplomatic</text>
  <text start="351.479" dur="6.34">manipulation they&amp;#39;re about power and</text>
  <text start="354.18" dur="7.65">protecting those people who handle the</text>
  <text start="357.819" dur="7.081">money systems the government arbitrarily</text>
  <text start="361.83" dur="5.41">labels anyone it doesn&amp;#39;t like including</text>
  <text start="364.9" dur="4.799">American citizens as terrorists and this</text>
  <text start="367.24" dur="5.31">is why they implemented the NDAA because</text>
  <text start="369.699" dur="5.52">they don&amp;#39;t just implement these laws for</text>
  <text start="372.55" dur="5.489">no reason they create these laws because</text>
  <text start="375.219" dur="4.56">they understand sooner or later they</text>
  <text start="378.039" dur="3.571">will need to use them and of course the</text>
  <text start="379.779" dur="4.14">NDAA the president come out and say you</text>
  <text start="381.61" dur="4.41">are a terrorist you go to jail for one</text>
  <text start="383.919" dur="4.351">year without any due process and it</text>
  <text start="386.02" dur="4.23">allows them to round up people as soon</text>
  <text start="388.27" dur="3.57">as you&amp;#39;re declared a terrorist that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="390.25" dur="5.25">they are saying your rights are</text>
  <text start="391.84" dur="7.319">completely gone and they can do pretty</text>
  <text start="395.5" dur="7.74">much whatever they want with you and the</text>
  <text start="399.159" dur="8.51">reason why they changed the political</text>
  <text start="403.24" dur="8.219">dissident label on people into</text>
  <text start="407.669" dur="5.41">it&amp;#39;s because it would be much easier for</text>
  <text start="411.459" dur="4.23">people including people within the CIA</text>
  <text start="413.079" dur="4.32">and law enforcement to accept the</text>
  <text start="415.689" dur="3.65">domestic operations that they thought</text>
  <text start="417.399" dur="4.7">they were aimed primarily at stopping</text>
  <text start="419.339" dur="5.77">terrorism rather than at stopping</text>
  <text start="422.099" dur="5.35">dissent and this is why we saw</text>
  <text start="425.109" dur="4.62">everything completely change to</text>
  <text start="427.449" dur="4.29">terrorism because this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="429.729" dur="5.13">looking to do and if you are deemed a</text>
  <text start="431.739" dur="6.57">terrorist the loft law enforcement DHS</text>
  <text start="434.859" dur="6.51">TSA have no problem bringing you in or</text>
  <text start="438.309" dur="5.85">killing you because they realize if you</text>
  <text start="441.369" dur="5.1">are a terrorist you&amp;#39;re here to hurt the</text>
  <text start="444.159" dur="4.98">homeland and this is how these people</text>
  <text start="446.469" dur="5.82">think and this is why when things go</text>
  <text start="449.139" dur="6.03">down the tubes these people are going to</text>
  <text start="452.289" dur="4.29">be out in force thinking that pretty</text>
  <text start="455.169" dur="3.63">much wherever their labeling is</text>
  <text start="456.579" dur="6.09">terrorists they&amp;#39;re going to go after and</text>
  <text start="458.799" dur="6.39">this is where the problem comes in now</text>
  <text start="462.669" dur="5.79">we understand that the president said he</text>
  <text start="465.189" dur="6.3">was going to change laws right executive</text>
  <text start="468.459" dur="4.53">orders with or without Congress probably</text>
  <text start="471.489" dur="3.66">most of the time without Congress</text>
  <text start="472.989" dur="4.95">because the process for him takes too</text>
  <text start="475.149" dur="5.4">long and you know he rather just do</text>
  <text start="477.939" dur="5.16">things on his own and right now other</text>
  <text start="480.549" dur="3.99">agencies are taking the lead here like</text>
  <text start="483.099" dur="6.69">the Department of Homeland Security</text>
  <text start="484.539" dur="6.84">along with with other agencies and the</text>
  <text start="489.789" dur="4.59">Department of Homeland Security right</text>
  <text start="491.379" dur="5.19">now what they are doing is they have</text>
  <text start="494.379" dur="3.96">published new exemptions that would</text>
  <text start="496.569" dur="4.53">allow immigrants who provided limited</text>
  <text start="498.339" dur="5.46">material support to terrorists into the</text>
  <text start="501.099" dur="6.15">country today so I&amp;#39;ve done a report a</text>
  <text start="503.799" dur="5.37">couple weeks back where I said DHS is</text>
  <text start="507.249" dur="4.26">bringing in terrorists by the busload</text>
  <text start="509.169" dur="4.53">well here they are they just change the</text>
  <text start="511.509" dur="4.351">law and what they are actually doing</text>
  <text start="513.699" dur="5.27">right now is they&amp;#39;re allowing these</text>
  <text start="515.86" dur="6.049">people in with limited terrorists</text>
  <text start="518.969" dur="6.251">Association to come into the country and</text>
  <text start="521.909" dur="5.98">jay johnson and Secretary of State John</text>
  <text start="525.22" dur="4.25">Kerry approved these exemptions and</text>
  <text start="527.889" dur="3.601">right now it&amp;#39;s under investigation</text>
  <text start="529.47" dur="4">because they&amp;#39;re saying they just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="531.49" dur="3.719">make these laws up it has to go through</text>
  <text start="533.47" dur="5.7">Congress and of course according to our</text>
  <text start="535.209" dur="5.511">Constitution yes it does now a couple</text>
  <text start="539.17" dur="2.959">reports back</text>
  <text start="540.72" dur="5.01">talked about how they&amp;#39;re trying to pass</text>
  <text start="542.129" dur="6.81">this bill in Turkey to shut down and</text>
  <text start="545.73" dur="5.099">limit the sites that people can see in</text>
  <text start="548.939" dur="5.101">Turkey off through the internet and</text>
  <text start="550.829" dur="5.49">right now the Prime Minister Erdogan has</text>
  <text start="554.04" dur="4.83">rejected claims that the country&amp;#39;s newly</text>
  <text start="556.319" dur="3.931">adopted cyber law will limit freedom of</text>
  <text start="558.87" dur="3.06">expression and remember what I have</text>
  <text start="560.25" dur="3.329">always say every time a government</text>
  <text start="561.93" dur="4.11">official comes out there and tells you</text>
  <text start="563.579" dur="3.69">that it don&amp;#39;t worry we&amp;#39;re not taking</text>
  <text start="566.04" dur="3">away your freedom it&amp;#39;s always the</text>
  <text start="567.269" dur="3.391">opposite and he went on to say that</text>
  <text start="569.04" dur="4.2">these regulations do not impose any</text>
  <text start="570.66" dur="6.299">censorship at all on the internet on the</text>
  <text start="573.24" dur="6.87">contrary they make it safer and freer</text>
  <text start="576.959" dur="6.541">that is completely false as we all know</text>
  <text start="580.11" dur="8.07">it it&amp;#39;s almost like the TSA is there it</text>
  <text start="583.5" dur="7.5">to help you to keep you safe the DHS is</text>
  <text start="588.18" dur="4.38">there to keep the people safe know what</text>
  <text start="591" dur="4.199">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re taking away our</text>
  <text start="592.56" dur="4.469">liberties and locking us down and</text>
  <text start="595.199" dur="4.2">watching our every move because they</text>
  <text start="597.029" dur="4.98">understand when this economic collapse</text>
  <text start="599.399" dur="4.831">comes they will be coming for the people</text>
  <text start="602.009" dur="4.471">on their lists and this is why they have</text>
  <text start="604.23" dur="5.01">created this these lists because they</text>
  <text start="606.48" dur="5.69">are tracking and making sure they know</text>
  <text start="609.24" dur="7.589">where every single person is now again I</text>
  <text start="612.17" dur="9.49">talked about Bosnia yesterday where we</text>
  <text start="616.829" dur="7.891">see the the bosnian government and the</text>
  <text start="621.66" dur="5.07">people and the people are rioting right</text>
  <text start="624.72" dur="4.229">now well we have the same situation in</text>
  <text start="626.73" dur="4.079">Ukraine and Bosnia was was going to join</text>
  <text start="628.949" dur="3.901">NATO and EU they&amp;#39;ve been putting it off</text>
  <text start="630.809" dur="4.5">putting it off but again the central</text>
  <text start="632.85" dur="3.989">bankers they&amp;#39;re being their backs are</text>
  <text start="635.309" dur="3.361">against the wall here they have to push</text>
  <text start="636.839" dur="4.411">these countries forward they have to get</text>
  <text start="638.67" dur="4.8">as many of these countries joined with</text>
  <text start="641.25" dur="4.199">NATO and the private western central</text>
  <text start="643.47" dur="3.929">bank implemented in these countries and</text>
  <text start="645.449" dur="4.771">they need to take on the EU or the US</text>
  <text start="647.399" dur="5.55">dollar to push this debt system further</text>
  <text start="650.22" dur="6.45">forward so they can prop up all of these</text>
  <text start="652.949" dur="6.75">currencies so right now in Bosnia we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="656.67" dur="6.24">seeing that the presidential palace in</text>
  <text start="659.699" dur="5.07">Bosnia was set on fire as riots broke</text>
  <text start="662.91" dur="3.359">out and of course they&amp;#39;re using all</text>
  <text start="664.769" dur="3.36">different other reasons of why these</text>
  <text start="666.269" dur="3.66">riots are breaking out because the</text>
  <text start="668.129" dur="3.93">economy is bad there people don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="669.929" dur="4.531">what&amp;#39;s going on but the real reason is</text>
  <text start="672.059" dur="4.321">because these central bankers are</text>
  <text start="674.46" dur="3.99">pushing their agenda forward and this is</text>
  <text start="676.38" dur="6.15">why we&amp;#39;re seeing this happen all over</text>
  <text start="678.45" dur="6.27">the place now we talk a lot about Iran</text>
  <text start="682.53" dur="5.76">and how we&amp;#39;re having these peace deals</text>
  <text start="684.72" dur="4.95">and and it&amp;#39;s all about nuclear and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="688.29" dur="3.42">discussed this before where it is</text>
  <text start="689.67" dur="6.23">completely not about nuclear whatsoever</text>
  <text start="691.71" dur="6.99">but I ran right now has dispatched the</text>
  <text start="695.9" dur="4.03">the Army&amp;#39;s naval fleet and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="698.7" dur="3.15">headed toward the United States at</text>

  <text start="701.85" dur="4.71">long-standing protest against us vessels</text>
  <text start="703.68" dur="5.28">in the Persian Gulf we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="706.56" dur="4.83">what happens there I&amp;#39;m sure nothing will</text>
  <text start="708.96" dur="4.83">happen at this point it&amp;#39;s just flexing</text>
  <text start="711.39" dur="4.17">muscles back and forth and this goes on</text>
  <text start="713.79" dur="3.39">to say the Iranian Army&amp;#39;s naval fleet</text>
  <text start="715.56" dur="3.9">have already started their voyage toward</text>
  <text start="717.18" dur="6.15">the Atlantic Ocean via the waters near</text>
  <text start="719.46" dur="9.24">South Africa and talk as we&amp;#39;re speaking</text>
  <text start="723.33" dur="7.77">about Iran right now the Iran&amp;#39;s supreme</text>
  <text start="728.7" dur="3.78">leader said on Saturday that the United</text>
  <text start="731.1" dur="4.32">States would overthrow the iranian</text>
  <text start="732.48" dur="4.53">government if it could adding washington</text>
  <text start="735.42" dur="3.51">had a controlling and meddlesome</text>
  <text start="737.01" dur="4.92">attitude towards the islamic republic</text>
  <text start="738.93" dur="6.87">and we understand the central bankers</text>
  <text start="741.93" dur="5.45">their end goal is to get into iran they</text>
  <text start="745.8" dur="4.26">want to overthrow the government</text>
  <text start="747.38" dur="5.98">eventually and put all the natural</text>
  <text start="750.06" dur="4.98">resources on the US dollar as the</text>
  <text start="753.36" dur="4.38">reserve currency and they want to do the</text>
  <text start="755.04" dur="4.98">same thing in Syria and they want to do</text>
  <text start="757.74" dur="3.93">the same thing in Africa and they want</text>
  <text start="760.02" dur="4.41">to do the same thing in Ukraine and in</text>
  <text start="761.67" dur="4.59">Bosnia and they are already right now in</text>
  <text start="764.43" dur="3.72">the Middle East holding control and</text>
  <text start="766.26" dur="3.51">keeping the people back because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="768.15" dur="3.93">already invaded all these countries and</text>
  <text start="769.77" dur="4.41">already put the US dollar as a reserve</text>
  <text start="772.08" dur="3.48">currency in those countries but the</text>
  <text start="774.18" dur="2.82">people are fighting back right now and</text>
  <text start="775.56" dur="3.66">those people who are fighting back they</text>
  <text start="777" dur="3.66">call al Qaeda and they are not</text>
  <text start="779.22" dur="3.17">terrorists they are people of the</text>
  <text start="780.66" dur="6">country trying to get their country back</text>
  <text start="782.39" dur="6.07">but right now the supreme leader said</text>
  <text start="786.66" dur="3.9">the American officials publicly say</text>
  <text start="788.46" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re not seek to regime change and</text>
  <text start="790.56" dur="4.41">they do not seek a regime change in Iran</text>
  <text start="792.66" dur="4.41">well he&amp;#39;s saying that to lie they</text>
  <text start="794.97" dur="4.86">wouldn&amp;#39;t hesitate a moment if they could</text>
  <text start="797.07" dur="7.14">do it and we know this as a fact that</text>
  <text start="799.83" dur="5.79">the the end goal and you have to</text>
  <text start="804.21" dur="3.39">remember this I know there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="805.62" dur="2.76">other news out there and there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="807.6" dur="3.81">of other information</text>
  <text start="808.38" dur="5.55">and they always try to manipulate what</text>
  <text start="811.41" dur="4.62">is actually the root cause of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="813.93" dur="3.93">going on it&amp;#39;s almost like a disease you</text>
  <text start="816.03" dur="4.11">know there&amp;#39;s a lot of different symptoms</text>
  <text start="817.86" dur="4.71">and a lot of different things but the</text>
  <text start="820.14" dur="4.26">only way to stop it is to go to the root</text>
  <text start="822.57" dur="5.04">cause and to understand what is actually</text>
  <text start="824.4" dur="7.95">going on and what we are seeing here is</text>
  <text start="827.61" dur="6.96">they are making a play in every single</text>
  <text start="832.35" dur="5.82">country now because they understand they</text>
  <text start="834.57" dur="8.94">need to prop up the US dollar right now</text>
  <text start="838.17" dur="8.52">they&amp;#39;re using a sneaky type of method to</text>
  <text start="843.51" dur="8.91">get into Iran there the illusion is of</text>
  <text start="846.69" dur="9.66">nuclear talks but the real goal is to</text>
  <text start="852.42" dur="5.19">get into Iranian banks this is what</text>
  <text start="856.35" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re trying to do they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="857.61" dur="3.54">infiltrate the banks the IMF is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="859.83" dur="3.06">looking into the banking situation</text>
  <text start="861.15" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re trying to set interest rates and</text>
  <text start="862.89" dur="4.35">eventually they will make their move to</text>
  <text start="864.99" dur="4.02">try to put all the natural resources on</text>
  <text start="867.24" dur="4.11">the US dollar but we have to remember</text>
  <text start="869.01" dur="4.23">Russia is there making deals with Iran</text>
  <text start="871.35" dur="4.35">right now and of course we know this to</text>
  <text start="873.24" dur="4.83">be true it&amp;#39;s because the United States</text>
  <text start="875.7" dur="4.26">and the central bankers have been saying</text>
  <text start="878.07" dur="3.72">to every country no you cannot do</text>
  <text start="879.96" dur="4.38">business with Iran yet they are not</text>
  <text start="881.79" dur="4.74">ready we&amp;#39;ll release some funds to show</text>
  <text start="884.34" dur="3.99">some good gesture but until we get the</text>
  <text start="886.53" dur="4.56">banking system the way we want it and</text>
  <text start="888.33" dur="5.85">we&amp;#39;re making a profit off of them you</text>
  <text start="891.09" dur="5.88">cannot do business and this is why they</text>
  <text start="894.18" dur="4.76">will impose sanctions in any country</text>
  <text start="896.97" dur="5.61">that tries to do business with Iran</text>
  <text start="898.94" dur="6.81">Syria on the other hand they understand</text>
  <text start="902.58" dur="5.91">there&amp;#39;s no way they can get in there</text>
  <text start="905.75" dur="5.59">what they need to do at this point is</text>
  <text start="908.49" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re going to strike into Syria and</text>
  <text start="911.34" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re going to use a false flag events</text>
  <text start="913.95" dur="3.78">like I&amp;#39;ve been talking about because</text>
  <text start="915.54" dur="7.11">they need Assad out of there they need</text>
  <text start="917.73" dur="6.72">to get into Syria replace their system</text>
  <text start="922.65" dur="3.66">put in the private western central bank</text>
  <text start="924.45" dur="3.81">and put all the natural resources using</text>
  <text start="926.31" dur="3.87">the US dollar because what has happened</text>
  <text start="928.26" dur="4.68">in Syria is that the war has been going</text>
  <text start="930.18" dur="5.49">on very long they the US government</text>
  <text start="932.94" dur="7.44">Israel Saudi Arabia the UK have been</text>
  <text start="935.67" dur="6.51">funding the rebels in Syria this battle</text>
  <text start="940.38" dur="4.86">has been going nowhere</text>
  <text start="942.18" dur="4.86">realize it it&amp;#39;s a lost situation this is</text>
  <text start="945.24" dur="4.23">why they tried the chemical attack in</text>
  <text start="947.04" dur="4.02">August because they knew this couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="949.47" dur="3.63">go on any longer because they was</text>
  <text start="951.06" dur="3.87">getting them no place and we&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="953.1" dur="4.2">towards the endgame here and they need</text>
  <text start="954.93" dur="4.44">to do something and you know again</text>
  <text start="957.3" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re their plans were pushed off</text>
  <text start="959.37" dur="4.469">because of Russia making a deal if we</text>
  <text start="962.58" dur="3.33">just get rid of their chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="963.839" dur="3.81">will you be happy of course they said</text>
  <text start="965.91" dur="3.72">yes but now here we are with the Geneva</text>
  <text start="967.649" dur="3.511">2 talks where they&amp;#39;re saying we want to</text>
  <text start="969.63" dur="3.09">sod remove we want a transitional</text>
  <text start="971.16" dur="3.51">government in there of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="972.72" dur="4.23">not going to get their way so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="974.67" dur="4.71">going to stamp their feet carry on and</text>
  <text start="976.95" dur="4.86">create this false flag event which</text>
  <text start="979.38" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;ve been building up to now for the</text>
  <text start="981.81" dur="5.49">last a couple of weeks they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="984.27" dur="5.189">really pushing it hard and we can see</text>
  <text start="987.3" dur="4.349">where they&amp;#39;re going with this we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="989.459" dur="4.771">going to see probably I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="991.649" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s tomorrow but in the next month two</text>
  <text start="994.23" dur="4.62">months we&amp;#39;ll probably see something</text>
  <text start="996.089" dur="4.531">occur or it might take a little bit</text>
  <text start="998.85" dur="4.02">longer but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s coming pretty</text>
  <text start="1000.62" dur="4.29">quickly because we can see how this has</text>
  <text start="1002.87" dur="3.719">built been building up very quickly and</text>
  <text start="1004.91" dur="4.59">they understand they need to get into</text>
  <text start="1006.589" dur="6.301">Syria and they under they understand</text>
  <text start="1009.5" dur="6.75">that the American people they do not</text>
  <text start="1012.89" dur="5.37">want war at all they do not have the</text>

  <text start="1018.26" dur="3.87">feel it has nothing to do with them so</text>
  <text start="1020.48" dur="2.97">what they&amp;#39;re going to do is of course</text>
  <text start="1022.13" dur="3.929">they&amp;#39;re going to have to bring it back</text>
  <text start="1023.45" dur="4.739">here to the United States and they will</text>
  <text start="1026.059" dur="4.291">probably push this agenda forward it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1028.189" dur="4.591">it might you might see attacks happening</text>
  <text start="1030.35" dur="4.739">in the UK and other places in the world</text>
  <text start="1032.78" dur="4.169">but the main one will hit in the United</text>
  <text start="1035.089" dur="3.331">States because they need to push this</text>
  <text start="1036.949" dur="4.051">forward and we have to understand their</text>
