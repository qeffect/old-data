  <text start="274.17" dur="5.66">that all of this now is starting to come</text>
  <text start="277.2" dur="4.8">out now Trump went out and he tweeted</text>
  <text start="279.83" dur="4.6">something very interesting and every</text>
  <text start="282" dur="5.48">time he tweets he&amp;#39;s trying to bring this</text>
  <text start="284.43" dur="6.21">into the public domain and slowly</text>
  <text start="287.48" dur="6.88">spoon-feed the public they get them used</text>

  <text start="299.28" dur="5.52">talked about the FISA warns slowly he</text>
  <text start="303.6" dur="2.79">let the sound of course the corporate</text>
  <text start="304.8" dur="2.76">media all laughed at it and said this is</text>
  <text start="306.39" dur="2.97">ridiculous they wouldn&amp;#39;t do that and</text>
  <text start="307.56" dur="4.5">then we come to find out that yeah this</text>
  <text start="309.36" dur="5.07">is true they were doing this an actual</text>
  <text start="312.06" dur="5.01">people signed off on it and there are</text>
  <text start="314.43" dur="4.56">doc there is documentation that leads to</text>
  <text start="317.07" dur="3.73">each of these individuals and we learned</text>
  <text start="318.99" dur="3.91">that clapper Brennan they lied about</text>
  <text start="320.8" dur="3.6">what that was really going on and we see</text>
  <text start="322.9" dur="4.44">right now that Trump is out there and he</text>
  <text start="324.4" dur="5.489">tweeted that our Justice Department must</text>
  <text start="327.34" dur="5.27">not let a one and Debbie</text>

  <text start="332.61" dur="6.97">Democrat IT scandal is a key to much of</text>
  <text start="336.97" dur="4.68">the corruption we see today they want to</text>
  <text start="339.58" dur="5.549">make a plea deal to hide what is on</text>
  <text start="341.65" dur="6.6">their server where is the server really</text>
  <text start="345.129" dur="4.5">bad and I believe they already know</text>
  <text start="348.25" dur="4.71">where the server is I think they already</text>
  <text start="349.629" dur="5.401">know what&amp;#39;s on that server from the data</text>
  <text start="352.96" dur="4.29">that is kept in the NSA and from</text>
  <text start="355.03" dur="5.25">military intelligence they already have</text>
  <text start="357.25" dur="7.08">that information they just need to do</text>
  <text start="360.28" dur="7.05">this legally to get the server looked at</text>
  <text start="364.33" dur="4.86">maybe they wiped it already we know they</text>
  <text start="367.33" dur="4.079">have the ability to do that with bit</text>
  <text start="369.19" dur="5.159">clean and all these other types of</text>
  <text start="371.409" dur="4.891">programs that wipe the servers clean but</text>
  <text start="374.349" dur="4.891">we see right now he&amp;#39;s bringing this out</text>
  <text start="376.3" dur="7.019">into the open letting people know this</text>
  <text start="379.24" dur="6.75">is where all of this is headed and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="383.319" dur="5.541">probably see a lot more of this now we</text>
  <text start="385.99" dur="7.109">see that the US has struck a deal with</text>
  <text start="388.86" dur="8.739">the ZTE company in China this is Chinese</text>
  <text start="393.099" dur="7.44">telecom join ZTE and remember what Q ZTE</text>
  <text start="397.599" dur="5.761">was very important because the ZTE</text>
  <text start="400.539" dur="4.35">phones they were used by the deep state</text>
  <text start="403.36" dur="3.29">now they ordered these phones and they</text>
  <text start="404.889" dur="4.381">thought they were going to be secure</text>
  <text start="406.65" dur="5.049">they didn&amp;#39;t want cameras they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="409.27" dur="5.16">want any type of open ports or anything</text>
  <text start="411.699" dur="5.881">on the phones and it come to find out</text>
  <text start="414.43" dur="5.849">that actually this was the opposite</text>
  <text start="417.58" dur="6.69">now the deep state they tried to buy</text>
  <text start="420.279" dur="6.241">tons of these ZTE phones before they got</text>
  <text start="424.27" dur="5.34">big in the US just for the government</text>
  <text start="426.52" dur="5.459">officials and specifically went to the</text>
  <text start="429.61" dur="5.13">manufacturers to request that the phones</text>
  <text start="431.979" dur="6.06">be totally secure no backdoors no</text>
  <text start="434.74" dur="7.109">ability to be hacked no camera and</text>
  <text start="438.039" dur="5.611">microphone monitoring now this was</text>
  <text start="441.849" dur="4.921">either right before Obama took office or</text>
  <text start="443.65" dur="5.819">possibly the same year well guess what</text>
  <text start="446.77" dur="4.5">the Chinese did the opposite they</text>
  <text start="449.469" dur="4.471">install backdoors on those secret phones</text>
  <text start="451.27" dur="4.38">and they could monitor the</text>
  <text start="453.94" dur="3.33">government officials up to the highest</text>
  <text start="455.65" dur="4.47">ranks the cameras work there were</text>
  <text start="457.27" dur="4.38">microphones and everything else and we</text>
  <text start="460.12" dur="3.57">know that there were certain individuals</text>
  <text start="461.65" dur="3.6">that had these phones some people saying</text>
  <text start="463.69" dur="4.59">that Clinton was carrying these phones</text>
  <text start="465.25" dur="6.15">and many others and we talked about with</text>
  <text start="468.28" dur="7.29">cue a video of Clinton and I&amp;#39;m wondering</text>
  <text start="471.4" dur="6.24">if this is how the videos the audio all</text>
  <text start="475.57" dur="5.67">of this was captured through these</text>
  <text start="477.64" dur="5.67">phones now if we go back in time we</text>
  <text start="481.24" dur="4.68">understand that Trump won and it wanted</text>
  <text start="483.31" dur="4.05">a reorganization of the company they</text>
  <text start="485.92" dur="2.31">were also going to hit them with a fine</text>
  <text start="487.36" dur="3.33">I think they&amp;#39;re gonna hit him with a</text>
  <text start="488.23" dur="4.98">billion dollar penalty against ete and</text>
  <text start="490.69" dur="5.13">that a compliance team selected by the</text>
  <text start="493.21" dur="4.44">US would be embedded at the company now</text>
  <text start="495.82" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s other parts of the deal that we</text>
  <text start="497.65" dur="4.05">don&amp;#39;t know of as of yet because they</text>
  <text start="500.08" dur="3.44">haven&amp;#39;t been revealed but I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="501.7" dur="5.46">there&amp;#39;s a lot more that&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="503.52" dur="5.14">let out for the public to hear and maybe</text>
  <text start="507.16" dur="4.08">some of it will be seeker we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="508.66" dur="5.4">as of yet we also have a strange</text>
  <text start="511.24" dur="6.45">occurrence in China at the US consulate</text>
  <text start="514.06" dur="7.68">in China and we&amp;#39;re getting information</text>
  <text start="517.69" dur="7.17">about another sonic boom where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="521.74" dur="6.54">making the people feel ill and people</text>
  <text start="524.86" dur="6.63">are leaving the consulate and this</text>
  <text start="528.28" dur="5.46">happened in Cuba and the question we</text>
  <text start="531.49" dur="6.74">need to ask is why why is it happening</text>
  <text start="533.74" dur="8.07">in both places now is the deep state</text>
  <text start="538.23" dur="5.59">embedded in these consulates now how do</text>
  <text start="541.81" dur="4.98">you get the individuals out without</text>
  <text start="543.82" dur="5.37">really taking anything and not having</text>
  <text start="546.79" dur="5.88">them come back for a while well you can</text>
  <text start="549.19" dur="5.37">use a sonic boom force everyone out send</text>
  <text start="552.67" dur="4.38">a team in there to check out the whole</text>
  <text start="554.56" dur="8.01">area collect certain data that you need</text>
  <text start="557.05" dur="7.71">and maybe target the deep state I mean</text>
  <text start="562.57" dur="4.769">this is just one theory but we can see</text>
  <text start="564.76" dur="6.54">right now this is a very very odd for</text>
  <text start="567.339" dur="7.951">this to be happening in both places now</text>
  <text start="571.3" dur="6.87">we see out in Europe European countries</text>
  <text start="575.29" dur="6.15">are not going along with George Soros or</text>
  <text start="578.17" dur="6.12">Merkel&amp;#39;s flexible EU immigration plan</text>
  <text start="581.44" dur="4.83">and we see right now the Czech Republic</text>
  <text start="584.29" dur="3.33">Italy and many other countries are</text>
  <text start="586.27" dur="4.68">saying listen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="587.62" dur="5.03">not joining this new flexible European</text>
  <text start="590.95" dur="4.44">Union strategy for refugee migration</text>
  <text start="592.65" dur="4.75">which is being pushed by Angela Merkel</text>
  <text start="595.39" dur="3.36">and we can see right now the Prime</text>
  <text start="597.4" dur="2.97">Minister of Czech Republic is saying</text>
  <text start="598.75" dur="4.23">absolutely not we&amp;#39;re not doing this and</text>
  <text start="600.37" dur="5.12">we see that Italy they are not doing</text>
  <text start="602.98" dur="5.04">this and we&amp;#39;re gonna see that Spain and</text>
  <text start="605.49" dur="4.48">other countries they&amp;#39;re gonna say you</text>
  <text start="608.02" dur="5.009">know something we&amp;#39;re not doing this</text>
  <text start="609.97" dur="6.559">either and we could see that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="613.029" dur="5.851">still a push to bring these refugees</text>
  <text start="616.529" dur="4.181">into each and every one of these</text>
  <text start="618.88" dur="3.93">countries with open borders but what</text>
  <text start="620.71" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the opposite</text>
  <text start="622.81" dur="6.87">happening we don&amp;#39;t have the same refugee</text>
  <text start="625.42" dur="7.109">crisis that we had back in 2012 20 13 14</text>
  <text start="629.68" dur="5.46">15 16 17 because what is happening right</text>
  <text start="632.529" dur="5.161">now is that refugees millions of them</text>
  <text start="635.14" dur="5.07">are headed back to their countries this</text>
  <text start="637.69" dur="5.1">is why Soros is down in Africa trying to</text>
  <text start="640.21" dur="5.94">get refugees up into Europe because the</text>
  <text start="642.79" dur="6.96">Middle East that&amp;#39;s a bust and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="646.15" dur="5.939">helping the situation where individuals</text>
  <text start="649.75" dur="5.55">want to go back to their country and not</text>
  <text start="652.089" dur="5.101">into Europe so this is a problem for</text>
  <text start="655.3" dur="4.08">them and they&amp;#39;re continually trying to</text>
  <text start="657.19" dur="5.04">push their agenda to have all these</text>
  <text start="659.38" dur="4.01">refugees move into these areas we see</text>
  <text start="662.23" dur="4.02">out in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="663.39" dur="6.67">president Ghani now announced a</text>
  <text start="666.25" dur="6.93">ceasefire with the Taliban the ceasefire</text>
  <text start="670.06" dur="5.399">is going to be until June 20th now we</text>
  <text start="673.18" dur="3.83">had wind of this from one of the</text>
  <text start="675.459" dur="3.421">generals I think it was Nicholson in</text>
