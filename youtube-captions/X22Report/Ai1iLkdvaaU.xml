  <text start="86.45" dur="7.38">that we are coming towards a crossroads</text>
  <text start="90.43" dur="6.369">where the deep state central bank the</text>
  <text start="93.83" dur="5.84">mainstream media they realize that they</text>
  <text start="96.799" dur="6.541">need to control the complete narrative</text>
  <text start="99.67" dur="6.22">which is the political narrative the</text>
  <text start="103.34" dur="4.62">geopolitical narrative the economic</text>
  <text start="105.89" dur="4.5">narrative they need to control it all</text>
  <text start="107.96" dur="4.589">and I do believe that they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="110.39" dur="3.93">this push right now and they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="112.549" dur="3.421">making this push through 2020 because</text>
  <text start="114.32" dur="5.04">they realize what&amp;#39;s on the other side</text>
  <text start="115.97" dur="7.079">they realize that if they cannot control</text>
  <text start="119.36" dur="7.11">the narrative at this point they&amp;#39;re done</text>
  <text start="123.049" dur="6.66">for and they definitely need to control</text>
  <text start="126.47" dur="6.15">the economic narrative because at this</text>
  <text start="129.709" dur="6.211">point right now they don&amp;#39;t have a chance</text>
  <text start="132.62" dur="7.53">Trump the Patriots they completely</text>
  <text start="135.92" dur="7.47">control the economic narrative now from</text>
  <text start="140.15" dur="6.089">what they are doing right now with the</text>
  <text start="143.39" dur="4.319">bad guys in the Central Bank you can see</text>
  <text start="146.239" dur="3.72">how they&amp;#39;re trying to position</text>
  <text start="147.709" dur="4.291">themselves to try to control the</text>
  <text start="149.959" dur="5.25">economic narrative remember they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="152" dur="3.959">want Trump to bring down the rates any</text>
  <text start="155.209" dur="5.131">further</text>
  <text start="155.959" dur="6.011">they don&amp;#39;t want Trump to push stimulus</text>
  <text start="160.34" dur="3.7">any further</text>
  <text start="161.97" dur="4.44">and what I mean by this is they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="164.04" dur="5.28">want Trump telling the Fed what to do</text>
  <text start="166.41" dur="4.92">and the Fed actually listening so</text>
  <text start="169.32" dur="3.51">remember there&amp;#39;s good guys there is bad</text>
  <text start="171.33" dur="3.78">guys within the central banking system</text>
  <text start="172.83" dur="4.38">just like in government just like with</text>
  <text start="175.11" dur="7.08">every other country there&amp;#39;s good and</text>
  <text start="177.21" dur="6.63">there&amp;#39;s bad and those individuals in the</text>
  <text start="182.19" dur="4.83">central bank I&amp;#39;m talking about the bad</text>
  <text start="183.84" dur="6.87">guys they realize that if Trump</text>
  <text start="187.02" dur="8.189">continues down this path they will never</text>
  <text start="190.71" dur="7.71">be able to get any of it back it will be</text>
  <text start="195.209" dur="5.571">a disaster for them and this is why</text>
  <text start="198.42" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re trying to stop this right now</text>
  <text start="200.78" dur="8.35">this is the point where they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="204.93" dur="6">you will not pass but Trump has already</text>
  <text start="209.13" dur="4.2">countered this and I&amp;#39;ve said this for</text>
  <text start="210.93" dur="3.84">quite a while I do believe that Powell</text>
  <text start="213.33" dur="4.77">is on the same page</text>
  <text start="214.77" dur="5.939">I know Trump lashes out at him I know</text>
  <text start="218.1" dur="5.91">Trump says I don&amp;#39;t understand what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="220.709" dur="6.361">doing but I do believe that for some</text>
  <text start="224.01" dur="6.33">reason he&amp;#39;s on the same page almost like</text>
  <text start="227.07" dur="6.139">when he criticized sessions over and</text>
  <text start="230.34" dur="6.33">over and over but behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="233.209" dur="5.28">something else was happening and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="236.67" dur="6.9">be talking about that in just a moment</text>
  <text start="238.489" dur="7.601">but first as we know the same elite the</text>
  <text start="243.57" dur="4.8">same establishment they&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="246.09" dur="5.66">same thing they&amp;#39;ve always done and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="248.37" dur="6.66">talking about the elections in the UK</text>
  <text start="251.75" dur="5.739">now Mich from mich talked he kind of</text>
  <text start="255.03" dur="3.78">laid this all out and I completely agree</text>
  <text start="257.489" dur="4.47">with him and I mentioned this yesterday</text>
  <text start="258.81" dur="4.59">where these poll numbers that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="261.959" dur="3.841">continually putting out they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="263.4" dur="6.12">completely fake and he said Boris</text>
  <text start="265.8" dur="8.22">Johnson United the Tories in contrast</text>
  <text start="269.52" dur="6.33">Jeremy Corbyn failed to unite labour and</text>
  <text start="274.02" dur="3.209">he said six-point compelling picture in</text>
  <text start="275.85" dur="3.74">chronological order</text>
  <text start="277.229" dur="4.771">Theresa may fail to deliver brexit</text>
  <text start="279.59" dur="4.93">support for the Tory party collapsed</text>
  <text start="282" dur="4.89">support for the brexit party soared</text>
  <text start="284.52" dur="5.25">support for the Labour Party collapsed</text>
  <text start="286.89" dur="5.339">as well things reversed for the Tories</text>
  <text start="289.77" dur="4.37">the moment it became apparent Boris</text>
  <text start="292.229" dur="3.231">Johnson will be the next prime minister</text>
  <text start="294.14" dur="3.74">support for the</text>
  <text start="295.46" dur="5.4">labor even after a recent surge</text>
  <text start="297.88" dur="7.78">languishes well below where it was a</text>
  <text start="300.86" dur="8.52">year ago at this juncture Johnson simply</text>
  <text start="305.66" dur="5.789">wants to avoid any major gaffes this is</text>
  <text start="309.38" dur="3.319">why when they had the debate it was</text>
  <text start="311.449" dur="4.021">quite boring</text>
  <text start="312.699" dur="5.081">he just wants this the play out he</text>
  <text start="315.47" dur="5.49">doesn&amp;#39;t want anything major to come up</text>
  <text start="317.78" dur="6.509">that&amp;#39;s not what this is all about his</text>
  <text start="320.96" dur="8.13">plan is already set the deal is already</text>
  <text start="324.289" dur="7.44">made and the UK will be leaving the EU</text>
  <text start="329.09" dur="4.65">now of course the EU the elite the</text>
  <text start="331.729" dur="3.78">establishment they&amp;#39;re gonna do whatever</text>
  <text start="333.74" dur="3.72">they have to to try to stop this this is</text>
  <text start="335.509" dur="3.84">what they&amp;#39;ve always done they really</text>
  <text start="337.46" dur="4.26">don&amp;#39;t want this deal they really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="339.349" dur="5.011">want to Brick&amp;#39;s it so they&amp;#39;re gonna push</text>
  <text start="341.72" dur="4.259">and push and push and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="344.36" dur="5.13">going to use polls they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="345.979" dur="5.93">fear and this is going to really ramp up</text>
  <text start="349.49" dur="4.89">and they&amp;#39;re gonna make people think that</text>
  <text start="351.909" dur="4.66">Corbin is in the lead you&amp;#39;ll see this</text>
  <text start="354.38" dur="4.74">every single day as we approach these</text>
  <text start="356.569" dur="4.94">elections and they&amp;#39;ll say oh they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="359.12" dur="5.97">tied and now Corbin&amp;#39;s taking the lead</text>
  <text start="361.509" dur="7.481">why in the world after all this time</text>
  <text start="365.09" dur="5.22">three years would they want Corbin they</text>
  <text start="368.99" dur="3.479">know he&amp;#39;s not going to deliver the</text>
  <text start="370.31" dur="5.52">brexit they know he&amp;#39;s not gonna do</text>
  <text start="372.469" dur="5.491">anything if they truly wanted him they</text>
  <text start="375.83" dur="5.1">would have brought him in already this</text>
  <text start="377.96" dur="5.37">is how you know the elite are desperate</text>
  <text start="380.93" dur="5.28">because they need to use these tricks to</text>
  <text start="383.33" dur="5.399">try to convince everyone that something</text>
  <text start="386.21" dur="5.19">is happening when it really isn&amp;#39;t now</text>
  <text start="388.729" dur="4.891">here in the United States the economy is</text>
  <text start="391.4" dur="4.38">really starting to pick up now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="393.62" dur="4.979">talking statistically of course I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="395.78" dur="4.29">want anyone to get confused here this is</text>
  <text start="398.599" dur="5.611">a central bank system</text>
  <text start="400.07" dur="7.349">it&amp;#39;s an illusionary system yes we all</text>
  <text start="404.21" dur="5.61">had to work within their system if you</text>
  <text start="407.419" dur="6.99">tried to go outside of their system you</text>
  <text start="409.82" dur="8.069">can&amp;#39;t survive so Trump is working within</text>
  <text start="414.409" dur="6.211">their system he understands how the game</text>
  <text start="417.889" dur="5.191">is played and he&amp;#39;s playing it and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="420.62" dur="3.87">playing it very very well all those</text>
  <text start="423.08" dur="3.42">individuals remember during the debate</text>
  <text start="424.49" dur="4.62">with Hillary Clinton where she said if</text>
  <text start="426.5" dur="5.4">Trump puts his plan forward there be</text>
  <text start="429.11" dur="6.99">millions of jobs lost if Trump is</text>
  <text start="431.9" dur="4.8">elected the market will crash have we</text>
  <text start="436.1" dur="4.53">seen this</text>
  <text start="436.7" dur="6.03">no remember they thought that they</text>
  <text start="440.63" dur="4.56">controlled what was going to happen in</text>
  <text start="442.73" dur="5.25">the economy which means they had</text>
  <text start="445.19" dur="5.13">controlled the Fed and this want this</text>
  <text start="447.98" dur="6.75">this is the reason why the Fed was</text>
  <text start="450.32" dur="7.41">raising rates in 2016 2017 2018 and then</text>
  <text start="454.73" dur="5.94">all of a sudden everything changed they</text>
  <text start="457.73" dur="7.8">thought they had him they thought they</text>
  <text start="460.67" dur="8.61">were in control but they&amp;#39;re not and if</text>
  <text start="465.53" dur="5.19">you notice the opposite is happening of</text>
  <text start="469.28" dur="4.71">everything that they thought was going</text>
  <text start="470.72" dur="4.89">to happen their plan got flushed down</text>
  <text start="473.99" dur="5.28">the toilet now if you look at the</text>
  <text start="475.61" dur="7.47">economy you can see that by lowering the</text>
  <text start="479.27" dur="6.06">rates which is adding drug to an</text>
  <text start="483.08" dur="4.29">illusionary system that the central</text>
  <text start="485.33" dur="4.08">bankers created and we have to play</text>
  <text start="487.37" dur="4.71">within their system it&amp;#39;s almost like the</text>
  <text start="489.41" dur="4.59">matrix where there are certain rules</text>
  <text start="492.08" dur="4.29">within the matrix and you have out you</text>
  <text start="494" dur="5.76">have to abide by them so you have to</text>
  <text start="496.37" dur="6.9">work within those rules Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="499.76" dur="5.88">this this is why he wants the Fed to</text>
  <text start="503.27" dur="4.89">push stimulus this is why he wants the</text>
  <text start="505.64" dur="5.64">Fed to cut rates it&amp;#39;s not to make the</text>
  <text start="508.16" dur="5.46">economy better it&amp;#39;s not to improve the</text>
  <text start="511.28" dur="6.15">central bank it&amp;#39;s not to help the</text>
  <text start="513.62" dur="7.95">central bank he&amp;#39;s doing it for the</text>
  <text start="517.43" dur="6.6">people it&amp;#39;s a specific plan that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="521.57" dur="4.44">pushing right now and when you look at</text>
  <text start="524.03" dur="4.82">the housing market because of the lower</text>
  <text start="526.01" dur="5.93">rates you can see existing home sales</text>
  <text start="528.85" dur="5.7">they have risen 1.9 percent in October</text>
  <text start="531.94" dur="5.01">the latest housing statistic</text>
  <text start="534.55" dur="7.54">demonstrates that there&amp;#39;s an upward lift</text>
  <text start="536.95" dur="8.68">because of low mortgage rates low</text>
  <text start="542.09" dur="8.1">financing costs continue to buoy the</text>
  <text start="545.63" dur="6.93">housing market and we know that if he</text>
  <text start="550.19" dur="4.5">gets the Fed or when he gets the Fed to</text>
  <text start="552.56" dur="4.61">lower rates and even further than they</text>
  <text start="554.69" dur="4.71">are today and push stimulus the economy</text>
  <text start="557.17" dur="5.32">within the rules of a central bank</text>
  <text start="559.4" dur="6.87">system it&amp;#39;s going to look even better</text>
  <text start="562.49" dur="4.52">now Trump would like the u.s. MCA to be</text>
  <text start="566.27" dur="3.06">passed</text>
  <text start="567.01" dur="5.56">we know Pelosi is not gonna do this</text>
  <text start="569.33" dur="6">she&amp;#39;s out there stating that oh yes she</text>
  <text start="572.57" dur="5.4">wants it passed but there might not be</text>
  <text start="575.33" dur="6.39">enough time to pass the u.s. MCA this</text>
  <text start="577.97" dur="7.32">year she&amp;#39;s holding this back as leverage</text>
  <text start="581.72" dur="6.27">she knows if she passes it now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="585.29" dur="4.92">going to create jobs it&amp;#39;s going to help</text>
  <text start="587.99" dur="6.9">the people of America she doesn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="590.21" dur="8.76">that she wants to use it later on when</text>
  <text start="594.89" dur="8.7">they&amp;#39;re in trouble and if she wait long</text>
  <text start="598.97" dur="8.04">enough the effect of passing it will not</text>
  <text start="603.59" dur="7.19">have a big impact on the economy and</text>
  <text start="607.01" dur="6.78">she&amp;#39;s trying to time this just right and</text>
  <text start="610.78" dur="5.8">this is why Trump is continually pushing</text>
  <text start="613.79" dur="6.39">for the u.s. MCA and every time she puts</text>
  <text start="616.58" dur="7.86">it off it looks bad for her and good for</text>
  <text start="620.18" dur="9.18">Trump she&amp;#39;s in a no-win situation but</text>
  <text start="624.44" dur="6.51">the bad guys in the central bank and I</text>
  <text start="629.36" dur="3.48">believe this is why Pelosi is also</text>
  <text start="630.95" dur="4.8">waiting she wants to see how the</text>
  <text start="632.84" dur="5.58">impeachment plays out what happens with</text>
  <text start="635.75" dur="5.49">the bad guys in the central bank pushing</text>
  <text start="638.42" dur="6.18">their narrative they are now pushing the</text>
  <text start="641.24" dur="5.31">idea that the interest rate cuts they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="644.6" dur="4.2">done for now I know in an election years</text>
  <text start="646.55" dur="4.38">coming up and normally the Fed doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="648.8" dur="5.28">like to get involved politically uh-huh</text>
  <text start="650.93" dur="4.35">I just winked my eye by the way what</text>
  <text start="654.08" dur="2.94">they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="655.28" dur="5.43">to let everyone know through the</text>
  <text start="657.02" dur="5.64">mainstream media that rate cuts are a</text>
  <text start="660.71" dur="5.07">thing of the past it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="662.66" dur="6.54">happen and if you look at many of the</text>
  <text start="665.78" dur="4.8">mainstream organizations you can see</text>
  <text start="669.2" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re putting the message out there</text>
  <text start="670.58" dur="4.26">this is from Yahoo News Fed officials</text>
  <text start="672.62" dur="5.85">split over October cut but now see</text>
  <text start="674.84" dur="6.48">interest rates as well calibrated this</text>
  <text start="678.47" dur="7.14">is coming out of LA Times and yes</text>
