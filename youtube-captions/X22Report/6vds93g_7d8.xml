  <text start="52.92" dur="4.979">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="56.489" dur="4.861">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="57.899" dur="6.241">episode 1463 bien today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.35" dur="5.79">January 4th 2018 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="64.14" dur="7.14">episode is it&amp;#39;s all closing in around</text>
  <text start="67.14" dur="6.3">the cabal only option left is let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="71.28" dur="4.5">into the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="73.44" dur="4.289">geopolitical news now it looks like</text>
  <text start="75.78" dur="5.97">there are many different investigations</text>
  <text start="77.729" dur="6.78">going on with the uranium one with Co me</text>
  <text start="81.75" dur="4.8">fusion GPS and it looks like it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="84.509" dur="3.871">coming down around the Cabal looks like</text>
  <text start="86.55" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re gonna become very very desperate</text>
  <text start="88.38" dur="4.83">because none of these people are going</text>
  <text start="90.24" dur="5.04">to want to go on trial so they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="93.21" dur="4.14">do whatever they have to distract what</text>
  <text start="95.28" dur="3.06">is going on here and I believe the</text>
  <text start="97.35" dur="2.37">Clintons are gonna be a little bit</text>
  <text start="98.34" dur="5.069">nervous now yesterday we talked about a</text>
  <text start="99.72" dur="6.06">fire in their Chappaqua house and maybe</text>
  <text start="103.409" dur="4.38">this was to destroy some evidence maybe</text>
  <text start="105.78" dur="5.25">to get rid of something we don&amp;#39;t know as</text>
  <text start="107.789" dur="5.64">of yet but we see that Attorney General</text>
  <text start="111.03" dur="4.8">Jeff Sessions is going to be taking a</text>
  <text start="113.429" dur="5.94">fresh look at the FBI&amp;#39;s investigation</text>
  <text start="115.83" dur="4.8">and remember that a lot of the</text>
  <text start="119.369" dur="3.99">information that was on the private</text>
  <text start="120.63" dur="6.29">server which was unsecure had some</text>
  <text start="123.359" dur="6.57">classified information on there and</text>
  <text start="126.92" dur="6.819">ironically this new information comes</text>
  <text start="129.929" dur="5.821">just one day after the fire broke out in</text>
  <text start="133.739" dur="5.101">the Clinton&amp;#39;s home which is kind of</text>
  <text start="135.75" dur="4.26">strange it reminds me of like 9/11 where</text>
  <text start="138.84" dur="2.82">they were telling us that they were</text>
  <text start="140.01" dur="4.47">missing 2 trillion from the Pentagon all</text>
  <text start="141.66" dur="4.65">of a sudden the World Trade Center was</text>
  <text start="144.48" dur="3.24">hit now that&amp;#39;s not the only thing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="146.31" dur="2.94">the only reason why the world trend sir</text>
  <text start="147.72" dur="3.09">trade center was brought down and that</text>
  <text start="149.25" dur="4.53">what&amp;#39;s the only reason for the vols flag</text>
  <text start="150.81" dur="5.61">but we can see it all plays into each</text>
  <text start="153.78" dur="6.03">other and remember when her emails were</text>
  <text start="156.42" dur="6.72">subpoenaed they were deleted the bleach</text>
  <text start="159.81" dur="4.89">bit was used to get rid of it and you</text>
  <text start="163.14" dur="4.8">know the whole thing was a complete and</text>
  <text start="164.7" dur="5.879">utter mess and right now we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="167.94" dur="4.35">to see that well it looks like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="170.579" dur="4.711">gonna be taking another look and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="172.29" dur="5.37">gonna dig deeper into this and if we go</text>
  <text start="175.29" dur="4.59">back in time we saw that there were</text>
  <text start="177.66" dur="4.29">other things that were happening I mean</text>
  <text start="179.88" dur="5.22">look at Comey for instance where he had</text>
  <text start="181.95" dur="5.64">these memos and he passed it on to his</text>
  <text start="185.1" dur="5.25">and which then submitted it to the New</text>
  <text start="187.59" dur="5.04">York Times and that was Daniel Richmond</text>
  <text start="190.35" dur="5.01">who was a Columbia University Law School</text>
  <text start="192.63" dur="5.85">professor and what we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="195.36" dur="5.64">realize is that some of these memos</text>
  <text start="198.48" dur="5.61">maybe at least one might have been</text>
  <text start="201" dur="5.49">classified and as Grassley notes for the</text>
  <text start="204.09" dur="5.97">7 Comey memos that he reviewed at the</text>
  <text start="206.49" dur="6.54">FBI were marked classified at the secret</text>
  <text start="210.06" dur="5.7">or confidential levels and if you use</text>
  <text start="213.03" dur="4.17">simple mathematical realities it would</text>
  <text start="215.76" dur="3.12">dictate that at least one of them</text>
  <text start="217.2" dur="4.68">contain material that the FBI now</text>
  <text start="218.88" dur="5.46">considers classified and it might have</text>
  <text start="221.88" dur="4.65">been one of those that Daniel Richmond</text>
  <text start="224.34" dur="3.99">had which wasn&amp;#39;t allowed to have which</text>
  <text start="226.53" dur="3.72">Comey was not allowed to bring out of</text>
  <text start="228.33" dur="4.41">the office which he was not allowed to</text>
  <text start="230.25" dur="4.83">submit to the New York Times and what</text>
  <text start="232.74" dur="5.87">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that if this</text>
  <text start="235.08" dur="6.93">is true then there&amp;#39;s going to be a huge</text>
  <text start="238.61" dur="6.67">problem for Comey for Richmond for the</text>
  <text start="242.01" dur="6.57">New York Times and we can see that this</text>
  <text start="245.28" dur="7.86">is all coming down around all of these</text>
  <text start="248.58" dur="7.17">individuals and we see right now that we</text>
  <text start="253.14" dur="5.51">knew that there was most of this was a</text>
  <text start="255.75" dur="6.359">complete force in the beginning that the</text>
  <text start="258.65" dur="6.07">hearings the memos that Comey released</text>
  <text start="262.109" dur="6.601">and they actually when they actually</text>
  <text start="264.72" dur="7.04">asked Richmond for the memos he never</text>
  <text start="268.71" dur="6.72">produced them he refused to provide them</text>
  <text start="271.76" dur="4.63">why I mean think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="275.43" dur="6.12">but that wasn&amp;#39;t out in the corporate</text>
  <text start="276.39" dur="6.93">media now the whole thing all these</text>
  <text start="281.55" dur="4.5">different things that were happening the</text>
  <text start="283.32" dur="5.16">uranium one the Comey memos the</text>
  <text start="286.05" dur="4.89">investigation into the email servers the</text>
  <text start="288.48" dur="4.32">fixing of the elections all this stuff</text>
  <text start="290.94" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s all going to come out into the open</text>
  <text start="292.8" dur="5.49">and again these people are going to be</text>
  <text start="296.61" dur="4.47">in trouble why do you think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="298.29" dur="6">trying to start war everywhere and if</text>
  <text start="301.08" dur="8.61">you notice every time they try to start</text>
  <text start="304.29" dur="7.2">war someplace it doesn&amp;#39;t work now if you</text>
  <text start="309.69" dur="3.78">really look at this they&amp;#39;ve been pushing</text>
  <text start="311.49" dur="3.33">the idea that North Korea is going to be</text>
  <text start="313.47" dur="2.37">attacking the United States corporate</text>
  <text start="314.82" dur="2.79">media is all over they have their</text>
  <text start="315.84" dur="3.06">analysts out there saying they have</text>
  <text start="317.61" dur="3.839">missiles that can reach the</text>
  <text start="318.9" dur="5.28">they don&amp;#39;t all that is made up it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="321.449" dur="5.731">propaganda and of course Trump actually</text>
  <text start="324.18" dur="5.489">plays into all of this and he gets old</text>
  <text start="327.18" dur="5.609">he gets the corporate media all riled up</text>
  <text start="329.669" dur="4.741">about this and he uses all these words</text>
  <text start="332.789" dur="3.571">like my nuke is bigger than yours</text>
  <text start="334.41" dur="4.77">remember these are words you need to</text>
  <text start="336.36" dur="4.89">look at the actions of people and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="339.18" dur="4.65">said this since I started this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="341.25" dur="7.02">always the actions not what people are</text>
  <text start="343.83" dur="6.27">saying is the truth words are</text>
  <text start="348.27" dur="3.63">meaningless I mean someone will say oh</text>
  <text start="350.1" dur="4.59">my new year&amp;#39;s resolution is to work out</text>
  <text start="351.9" dur="4.35">every day for the next year and they</text>
  <text start="354.69" dur="3.3">start out and they work out for 20 days</text>
  <text start="356.25" dur="5.75">and that&amp;#39;s it those were words their</text>
  <text start="357.99" dur="9.709">actions show that they&amp;#39;re not doing it</text>
  <text start="362" dur="8.56">same thing here right now we knew that</text>
  <text start="367.699" dur="6.551">the Cabal was trying to start a war in</text>
  <text start="370.56" dur="5.49">North Korea they wanted the forces to go</text>
  <text start="374.25" dur="5.07">in and have regime change in North Korea</text>
  <text start="376.05" dur="4.739">and they kept telling us that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="379.32" dur="3.24">going to be a disaster</text>
  <text start="380.789" dur="3.961">Kim jong-un is crazy he&amp;#39;s gonna fire a</text>
  <text start="382.56" dur="3.05">missile at the United States well that</text>
  <text start="384.75" dur="3.419">never happened</text>
  <text start="385.61" dur="4.8">and we talked about how moon jae-in from</text>
  <text start="388.169" dur="5.101">South Korea has been talking about peace</text>
  <text start="390.41" dur="4.39">once a store we restore relationships we</text>
  <text start="393.27" dur="3.6">talked about how their secret talks</text>
  <text start="394.8" dur="4.5">going on behind the scenes why the</text>
  <text start="396.87" dur="5.039">corporate media is busy other things are</text>
  <text start="399.3" dur="6.27">happening now we know that North Korea</text>
  <text start="401.909" dur="6.841">spoke to South Korea they opened up the</text>
  <text start="405.57" dur="5.4">hotline and on january 9th they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="408.75" dur="3.81">be talking even further than what</text>
  <text start="410.97" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;ve already done they got it ready</text>
  <text start="412.56" dur="6.09">and we see that Kim jong-un he feels in</text>
  <text start="416.22" dur="4.11">a comfortable position where he has some</text>
  <text start="418.65" dur="3.75">type of nuclear weapon and some type of</text>
  <text start="420.33" dur="6.66">missile that will fly that can cause</text>
  <text start="422.4" dur="6.389">damage to different areas so he feels</text>
  <text start="426.99" dur="3.66">comfortable enough that he&amp;#39;s at in a</text>
  <text start="428.789" dur="4.35">position where he can say that yet we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="430.65" dur="4.86">a nuclear state and I think this was the</text>
  <text start="433.139" dur="4.441">plan all along and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="435.51" dur="5.49">right now is that Trump came out and</text>
  <text start="437.58" dur="7.019">said listen we&amp;#39;re not gonna have drills</text>
  <text start="441" dur="5.61">during the Winter Olympics moon jae-in</text>
  <text start="444.599" dur="4.801">said we should shut down the drills</text>
  <text start="446.61" dur="5.67">during this period of time now the</text>
  <text start="449.4" dur="5.37">drills have been shut down there</text>
  <text start="452.28" dur="4.89">won&amp;#39;t be any type of provocation towards</text>
  <text start="454.77" dur="4.32">North Korea during this period this is</text>
  <text start="457.17" dur="4.98">this is definitely not what the Cabal</text>
  <text start="459.09" dur="5.46">wants they want a drill during the</text>
  <text start="462.15" dur="5.46">Winter Olympics they want an event</text>
  <text start="464.55" dur="4.38">during this period of time and actually</text>
  <text start="467.61" dur="4.23">Trump is out there saying it&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="468.93" dur="6.39">thing that South Korea and North Korea</text>
  <text start="471.84" dur="5.579">are talking this was the end goal this</text>
  <text start="475.32" dur="3.63">is what they wanted to do now the Cabal</text>
  <text start="477.419" dur="4.081">tried it too they tried to start</text>
  <text start="478.95" dur="4.95">something inner Ram and you can tell who</text>
  <text start="481.5" dur="4.08">is part of a cabal and who isn&amp;#39;t part of</text>
  <text start="483.9" dur="3.12">the Cabal those people who are part of</text>
  <text start="485.58" dur="3.18">the Cabal they&amp;#39;re like cysts you know</text>
  <text start="487.02" dur="4.35">from Star Wars where they see things</text>
  <text start="488.76" dur="5.79">black and white where they say you know</text>
  <text start="491.37" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s either this way or that way or</text>
  <text start="494.55" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re fighting for freedom and we need</text>
  <text start="496.8" dur="3.57">to protect them we need to go in there</text>
  <text start="498.78" dur="3.18">and remove the dictators they always</text>
  <text start="500.37" dur="3.33">have this black-and-white view of</text>
  <text start="501.96" dur="4.08">everything and they try to convince you</text>
  <text start="503.7" dur="4.44">through words that this is really</text>
  <text start="506.04" dur="4.47">happening and they use the corporate</text>
  <text start="508.14" dur="5.16">media as their mouthpiece to convince</text>
  <text start="510.51" dur="6.87">you and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="513.3" dur="6.51">that Russia and China they&amp;#39;re calling</text>
  <text start="517.38" dur="5.25">for a policy of non-interference and</text>
  <text start="519.81" dur="4.5">Iran&amp;#39;s domestic affairs they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="522.63" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s none of anyone&amp;#39;s business as an</text>
  <text start="524.31" dur="5.33">internal problem and we know that the</text>
  <text start="527.13" dur="5.4">United States the Cabal I should say</text>
  <text start="529.64" dur="4.93">they want to interfere Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="532.53" dur="4.02">wants to interfere Israel wants to</text>
  <text start="534.57" dur="6.42">interfere inside of Iran because their</text>
  <text start="536.55" dur="6.51">entire goal was to get in there and we</text>
  <text start="540.99" dur="4.32">know that the US and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="543.06" dur="5.7">coalition forces they&amp;#39;re running to the</text>
  <text start="545.31" dur="8.01">UN because they realize that their</text>
  <text start="548.76" dur="8.36">entire plan of having riots and having</text>
  <text start="553.32" dur="7.74">regime change is falling apart right now</text>
  <text start="557.12" dur="7.9">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that these protests</text>
  <text start="561.06" dur="6.9">they&amp;#39;re ending there are huge government</text>
  <text start="565.02" dur="5.55">protests much much much larger than what</text>
  <text start="567.96" dur="5.61">was happening with the economic protest</text>
  <text start="570.57" dur="5.64">now these were economic protests these</text>
  <text start="573.57" dur="5.85">were not freedom we want regime change</text>
  <text start="576.21" dur="6.6">protests that was the rioters that were</text>
  <text start="579.42" dur="6.72">placed in the country to try to force</text>
  <text start="582.81" dur="5.43">everyone into this gigantic protest</text>
  <text start="586.14" dur="4.59">regime change but the original protest</text>
  <text start="588.24" dur="4.2">was economic had nothing to do with we</text>
  <text start="590.73" dur="3.48">want a different leader or we were</text>
  <text start="592.44" dur="4.02">fighting for freedom like Clinton said</text>
  <text start="594.21" dur="2.97">in her tweet had nothing to do that</text>
  <text start="596.46" dur="3.39">whatsoever</text>
  <text start="597.18" dur="5.61">it only had to do with economics and</text>
  <text start="599.85" dur="6.36">those protesters well they realized that</text>
  <text start="602.79" dur="4.86">okay yes we&amp;#39;re having a tough time right</text>
  <text start="606.21" dur="4.86">now the president came out and spoke to</text>
  <text start="607.65" dur="6.3">us and most of them were satisfied but</text>
  <text start="611.07" dur="5.07">the rioters kept pushing</text>
  <text start="613.95" dur="5.19">they kept burning things they kept</text>
  <text start="616.14" dur="7.73">destroying things and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="619.14" dur="9">right now is that the major economic</text>
  <text start="623.87" dur="7.14">protesters they&amp;#39;ve stopped and the whole</text>
  <text start="628.14" dur="5.91">thing is falling apart right now and</text>
  <text start="631.01" dur="6.04">they couldn&amp;#39;t get a color revolution</text>
  <text start="634.05" dur="5.43">like they had in Syria or they tried to</text>
  <text start="637.05" dur="6.99">have in Syria like in Libya Lebanon it</text>
  <text start="639.48" dur="7.05">didn&amp;#39;t work out in Iran and we can see</text>
  <text start="644.04" dur="4.86">that most likely they were trying to</text>
  <text start="646.53" dur="4.44">shatter the p5 plus 1 deal they were</text>
  <text start="648.9" dur="3.39">trying to have regime change they were</text>
  <text start="650.97" dur="5.4">trying to do whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="652.29" dur="5.4">to basically reach their goal and that</text>
  <text start="656.37" dur="3.93">was to take over Iran and maybe</text>
  <text start="657.69" dur="4.92">backtrack and go into Syria if they</text>
  <text start="660.3" dur="4.95">could do it and it looks like they</text>
  <text start="662.61" dur="5.97">really can&amp;#39;t because they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="665.25" dur="6.51">problem the problem is they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="668.58" dur="6.77">power which tells us they&amp;#39;re becoming</text>
  <text start="671.76" dur="7.71">desperate what do desperate people do</text>
  <text start="675.35" dur="6.97">they do something even bigger and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="679.47" dur="4.8">when we need to start to worry because</text>
  <text start="682.32" dur="4.23">they can&amp;#39;t get something off the ground</text>
  <text start="684.27" dur="5.04">in North Korea they they&amp;#39;re trying and</text>
  <text start="686.55" dur="3.69">Iran Syria looks like it&amp;#39;s off the</text>
  <text start="689.31" dur="3.63">drawing board right now they have</text>
  <text start="690.24" dur="4.98">Ukraine but that might not even work out</text>
  <text start="692.94" dur="4.2">either it depends on what they do if</text>
  <text start="695.22" dur="4.71">they start something with maybe an</text>
  <text start="697.14" dur="4.86">explosion and event of some sorts a</text>
  <text start="699.93" dur="4.26">nuclear explosion or anything like that</text>
  <text start="702" dur="4.47">we might see something get off the</text>
  <text start="704.19" dur="4.53">ground I mean it might happen to North</text>
  <text start="706.47" dur="3.72">Korea we don&amp;#39;t know it might happen</text>
  <text start="708.72" dur="3.6">during the Olympics since there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="710.19" dur="4.17">drills right now this is a red flag</text>
  <text start="712.32" dur="3.57">showing that mmm they might try it</text>
  <text start="714.36" dur="2.97">something during the Olympic period of</text>
  <text start="715.89" dur="4.17">time because they&amp;#39;re not getting that</text>
  <text start="717.33" dur="4.2">provocation from the drill where they</text>
  <text start="720.06" dur="3.21">or they were hoping that North Korea</text>
  <text start="721.53" dur="2.91">would do something I don&amp;#39;t think North</text>
  <text start="723.27" dur="2.91">Korea is gonna do anything they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="724.44" dur="2.97">looking for peace right now they feel</text>
  <text start="726.18" dur="3.24">that they&amp;#39;re in a comfortable position</text>
  <text start="727.41" dur="3.78">because they have a nuclear weapon they</text>
  <text start="729.42" dur="3.6">have a missile that kind of can fly they</text>
  <text start="731.19" dur="3.27">can cause maybe damage to Japan</text>
  <text start="733.02" dur="3.54">that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;ve been flying the</text>
  <text start="734.46" dur="4.02">missiles around Japan to see if they can</text>
  <text start="736.56" dur="5.1">reach Japan which tells you that you can</text>
  <text start="738.48" dur="4.47">reach Guam before it breaks up where it</text>
  <text start="741.66" dur="4.02">could reach definitely South Korea</text>
  <text start="742.95" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re using this to say listen we can</text>
  <text start="745.68" dur="5.94">cause damage if you come in here and the</text>
  <text start="748.89" dur="5.19">Cabal noses so this is why Kim jong-un</text>
  <text start="751.62" dur="5.25">at this point is so willing to have</text>
  <text start="754.08" dur="4.62">talks because he&amp;#39;s in a position where</text>
  <text start="756.87" dur="5.76">he knows that he can cause damage</text>
  <text start="758.7" dur="6.18">someplace else and we see right now all</text>
  <text start="762.63" dur="4.74">those talks behind the scenes they&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="764.88" dur="6.87">a point where they&amp;#39;re saying okay now is</text>
  <text start="767.37" dur="7.89">the time now we see that Iran has opened</text>
  <text start="771.75" dur="7.49">the borders with Iraq the Iraq Kurdistan</text>
  <text start="775.26" dur="7.08">region and once again Russia China Iran</text>

  <text start="782.34" dur="5.79">joining Iran the whole thing is falling</text>
  <text start="785.25" dur="4.89">apart and these individuals they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="788.13" dur="4.41">worried about this I mean the CIA</text>
  <text start="790.14" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re coming out with reports now and</text>
  <text start="792.54" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re trying to cover up everything</text>
  <text start="793.98" dur="5.07">that they&amp;#39;ve done saying that al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="796.5" dur="5.4">the Islamic state they&amp;#39;re all part of</text>

  <text start="805.71" dur="3.75">Islamic state and other terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="807.06" dur="5.76">which is completely fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="809.46" dur="5.79">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is divert</text>
  <text start="812.82" dur="4.29">everyone&amp;#39;s attention to Iran and make</text>
  <text start="815.25" dur="2.88">everyone think that the terrorists came</text>
  <text start="817.11" dur="2.94">all from there</text>
  <text start="818.13" dur="3.81">and this report that they&amp;#39;re coming out</text>
  <text start="820.05" dur="4.35">with is completely fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="821.94" dur="5.4">plus they have to use it to say that oh</text>
  <text start="824.4" dur="5.46">this is what happened in 2001 since Iran</text>
  <text start="827.34" dur="5.42">was part of al Qaeda they brought down</text>
  <text start="829.86" dur="5.73">the towers they&amp;#39;re trying to cover up</text>
  <text start="832.76" dur="6.64">everything they&amp;#39;ve done it&amp;#39;s a mop-up</text>
  <text start="835.59" dur="6">operation of all their crap and what is</text>
  <text start="839.4" dur="4.89">happening right now is the walls are</text>
  <text start="841.59" dur="6.87">closing in around them and as you can</text>
  <text start="844.29" dur="7.37">see from the actions of people not what</text>
  <text start="848.46" dur="5.4">they say you can see what is going on</text>
  <text start="851.66" dur="6.06">there was no invasion and</text>
  <text start="853.86" dur="7.56">area the Islamic state is being fought</text>
  <text start="857.72" dur="5.619">in Afghanistan the poppy fields are</text>

  <text start="882.51" dur="5.31">not going anywhere it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="885.06" dur="6">happen unless like I said unless the</text>
  <text start="887.82" dur="5.88">Cabal pulls out the big guns unless they</text>
  <text start="891.06" dur="6.089">push something very hard and I believe</text>
  <text start="893.7" dur="6.03">they might be getting ready to do this</text>
  <text start="897.149" dur="4.231">because they have nothing left what do</text>
  <text start="899.73" dur="3.78">you do when you have nothing left you do</text>
  <text start="901.38" dur="3.329">the event of all events and it looks</text>
  <text start="903.51" dur="2.91">like we&amp;#39;re approaching this period of</text>
  <text start="904.709" dur="3.361">time because we can see the walls were</text>
  <text start="906.42" dur="3.51">closing around them with the</text>
  <text start="908.07" dur="4.68">investigation into the uranium one deal</text>
  <text start="909.93" dur="5.13">of the Comey memos the email server</text>

  <text start="915.06" dur="4.529">in government all those under other</text>
  <text start="917.339" dur="3.421">individuals that were involved think</text>
  <text start="919.589" dur="3.601">about all these people that would have</text>
  <text start="920.76" dur="4.079">to stand trial they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="923.19" dur="4.649">they&amp;#39;re not gonna just sit back and go</text>

  <text start="927.839" dur="4.081">know that they need to do something at</text>
  <text start="929.82" dur="6.99">this point because if they don&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="931.92" dur="7.65">right now they lose so we can expect and</text>
  <text start="936.81" dur="5.76">I think something something big is</text>
  <text start="939.57" dur="4.889">brewing right now because they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="942.57" dur="4.65">get what they wanted out of Iran with</text>
  <text start="944.459" dur="7.021">these protests and I think the next</text>
  <text start="947.22" dur="6.359">phase is to notch it up and have</text>
  <text start="951.48" dur="3.57">something even bigger than what was</text>
