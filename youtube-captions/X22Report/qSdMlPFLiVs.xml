  <text start="105.65" dur="8.009">the house passes hey China first act I</text>
  <text start="108.92" dur="9.83">mean you can really tell that something</text>
  <text start="113.659" dur="12">is really wrong when our government</text>
  <text start="118.75" dur="10.479">passes an act that basically is telling</text>
  <text start="125.659" dur="6.421">everyone when the foreign nations come</text>

  <text start="155.36" dur="5.31">settle up debt with bondholders first</text>
  <text start="157.48" dur="6.31">foreign nations like China that holds</text>
  <text start="160.67" dur="7.86">you know trillions on it bonds would be</text>
  <text start="163.79" dur="8.12">the first to receive payment and I mean</text>

  <text start="292.58" dur="6.18">we hear many different stories about you</text>
  <text start="294.98" dur="7.35">know Syria and about who&amp;#39;s supplying</text>
  <text start="298.76" dur="6.36">weapons and I mean if you read the</text>
  <text start="302.33" dur="5.07">mainstream media they tell us that you</text>
  <text start="305.12" dur="3.84">know Rush is making new deals of new</text>
  <text start="307.4" dur="4.23">weapons and they&amp;#39;re going to be selling</text>
  <text start="308.96" dur="5.85">it Russia comes out and says no we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="314.81" dur="3.87">already have with serious applying them</text>
  <text start="316.61" dur="4.8">weapons and there are no new contracts</text>
  <text start="318.68" dur="5.1">that we have so there is so much</text>
  <text start="321.41" dur="5.91">propaganda going on right now to</text>
  <text start="323.78" dur="7.17">convince the American people that&amp;#39;s much</text>
  <text start="327.32" dur="11.4">more is going on over there then what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="330.95" dur="11.4">really happening and you can see that a</text>
  <text start="338.72" dur="7.41">lot of things that America is claiming</text>
  <text start="342.35" dur="6.45">is not being backed up by the UN for</text>
  <text start="346.13" dur="4.68">example the chemical weapons that they</text>
  <text start="348.8" dur="4.02">thought if they came out and they said</text>
  <text start="350.81" dur="3.78">you know the Syrian government is using</text>
  <text start="352.82" dur="3.96">chemical weapons on their people</text>
  <text start="354.59" dur="3.84">America&amp;#39;s would jump up and say oh my</text>
  <text start="356.78" dur="3.75">god we have to save them we have to go</text>
  <text start="358.43" dur="3.99">and we have to help them but the</text>
  <text start="360.53" dur="5.49">American people don&amp;#39;t care they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="362.42" dur="6.65">they&amp;#39;re sleeping they&amp;#39;re there to there</text>
  <text start="366.02" dur="6.3">they&amp;#39;re too involved in their own lives</text>
  <text start="369.07" dur="5.47">they don&amp;#39;t care about Syria they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="372.32" dur="4.44">care about the war over there the only</text>
  <text start="374.54" dur="5.16">reason why the government cares about</text>
  <text start="376.76" dur="5.76">that is because of money because of</text>
  <text start="379.7" dur="5.73">central banking because of them not</text>
  <text start="382.52" dur="5.73">using the dollar as the as the reserve</text>
  <text start="385.43" dur="5.97">currency over there that is the only</text>
  <text start="388.25" dur="5.73">reason the rest of us we don&amp;#39;t care we</text>
  <text start="391.4" dur="4.89">don&amp;#39;t want to be involved but that blew</text>
  <text start="393.98" dur="5.31">up in their face because the UN came out</text>
  <text start="396.29" dur="6.72">and said no it wasn&amp;#39;t the Syrian</text>
  <text start="399.29" dur="5.22">government it was the rebels and you</text>
  <text start="403.01" dur="2.97">know then of course</text>
  <text start="404.51" dur="3.87">the United States government is like</text>
  <text start="405.98" dur="6.39">what no no it is the Syrian government</text>
  <text start="408.38" dur="6.93">and now we have today the United Kingdom</text>
  <text start="412.37" dur="5.67">coming out saying oh no no the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="415.31" dur="5.04">right it is the Syrian government so you</text>
  <text start="418.04" dur="5.6">could see what&amp;#39;s happening here they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="420.35" dur="7.71">losing their their footing on war and</text>
  <text start="423.64" dur="5.67">this is not good in in in in a certain</text>
  <text start="428.06" dur="5.52">way and I&amp;#39;m going to tell you why later</text>
  <text start="429.31" dur="8.8">but they are losing the fight of</text>
  <text start="433.58" dur="8.6">bringing the war to this area because</text>
  <text start="438.11" dur="7.53">the American people are just not into it</text>
  <text start="442.18" dur="6.31">now it looks like us alerts to elite</text>
  <text start="445.64" dur="6">military units to be on standby over</text>
  <text start="448.49" dur="8.04">deteriorating Libyan situation so</text>
  <text start="451.64" dur="7.59">basically it it looks like things are</text>
  <text start="456.53" dur="4.95">happening in Libya and I guess the</text>
  <text start="459.23" dur="4.5">people there don&amp;#39;t like the new Central</text>
  <text start="461.48" dur="4.59">Bank and the new puppet regime that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="463.73" dur="6.15">set up there and they want their country</text>
  <text start="466.07" dur="6.75">back and basically the article goes on</text>
  <text start="469.88" dur="4.53">to say earlier today news cross the wire</text>
  <text start="472.82" dur="3.08">that the British Embassy was pulling all</text>
  <text start="474.41" dur="3.75">non-essential staff from its Libya</text>
  <text start="475.9" dur="4.93">embassy with the release of this warning</text>
  <text start="478.16" dur="4.29">given the security implications of the</text>
  <text start="480.83" dur="3.75">ongoing political uncertainty the</text>
  <text start="482.45" dur="4.8">British Embassy is temporarily withdrawn</text>
  <text start="484.58" dur="4.26">a small number of staff mainly those who</text>
  <text start="487.25" dur="3.21">work in support of government ministries</text>
  <text start="488.84" dur="3.51">which have been affected by recent</text>
  <text start="490.46" dur="5.13">developments moments ago perhaps an</text>
  <text start="492.35" dur="6.42">attempt to avoid humiliation by Hillary</text>
  <text start="495.59" dur="5.82">Clinton and the Benghazi fiasco the US</text>
  <text start="498.77" dur="4.8">military has alerted to elite military</text>
  <text start="501.41" dur="4.35">units in Europe to be on standby if</text>
  <text start="503.57" dur="5.94">needed to respond to a deteriorating</text>
  <text start="505.76" dur="7.61">security situation in Tripoli so we can</text>
  <text start="509.51" dur="6.24">see that something is happening here and</text>
  <text start="513.37" dur="4.21">basically that goes on to say we are</text>
  <text start="515.75" dur="4.29">repositioning assets in the region that</text>
  <text start="517.58" dur="6.87">could respond if necessary a senior</text>
  <text start="520.04" dur="6.12">military official told Fox News so we</text>
  <text start="524.45" dur="5.34">can see things are heating up the</text>
  <text start="526.16" dur="5.88">American people are not in two wars the</text>
  <text start="529.79" dur="4.64">people in Libya do not like the central</text>
  <text start="532.04" dur="5.04">bank or the new government there and</text>
  <text start="534.43" dur="3.6">things are starting to break down but</text>
  <text start="537.08" dur="3.14">again</text>
  <text start="538.03" dur="5.85">they need the support of the American</text>
  <text start="540.22" dur="6.75">people to go into war and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="543.88" dur="4.86">have it right now and another article</text>
  <text start="546.97" dur="4.47">goes on to say us prepares war with</text>
  <text start="548.74" dur="5.46">Syria as Washington backed al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="551.44" dur="6.3">rebels lose ground the Syria armed</text>
  <text start="554.2" dur="6.57">forces are basically winning the fight</text>
  <text start="557.74" dur="5.52">and there are rebel forces that are</text>
  <text start="560.77" dur="5.04">backed by or actually the mercenary</text>
  <text start="563.26" dur="5.28">forces that are sent there through the</text>
  <text start="565.81" dur="6.06">United States and Israel are losing</text>
  <text start="568.54" dur="6.75">ground and this is a tough thing because</text>
  <text start="571.87" dur="7.5">if they continue to lose ground there go</text>
  <text start="575.29" dur="6.78">the war effort so they need to do</text>
  <text start="579.37" dur="8.1">something they need to get the people of</text>
  <text start="582.07" dur="10.29">the United States all basically all up</text>
  <text start="587.47" dur="9.75">in arms angry pissed off something has</text>
  <text start="592.36" dur="8.55">to happen something big soon has to</text>
  <text start="597.22" dur="5.91">happen okay let&amp;#39;s just move on for a</text>
  <text start="600.91" dur="4.43">second coat come to come control and</text>
  <text start="603.13" dur="5.52">then we&amp;#39;ll come back to what plan B is</text>
  <text start="605.34" dur="8.67">and this has to do with Syria it has to</text>
  <text start="608.65" dur="9.05">do with getting America into war</text>
  <text start="614.01" dur="5.83">basically a Missouri legislature</text>
  <text start="617.7" dur="10.66">nullifies all federal gun control</text>
  <text start="619.84" dur="10.92">measures by a veto-proof majority so</text>
  <text start="628.36" dur="7.16">that&amp;#39;s good that they&amp;#39;re doing this and</text>
  <text start="630.76" dur="7.32">the Second Amendment is intact and</text>
  <text start="635.52" dur="7.06">basically every state should be doing</text>
  <text start="638.08" dur="7.77">this now there was an interesting</text>
  <text start="642.58" dur="5.1">article that says the UN a Senate</text>
  <text start="645.85" dur="4.77">declares the entire USA to be a</text>
  <text start="647.68" dur="7.71">battleground a bill passed late last</text>
  <text start="650.62" dur="7.2">night 9307 that the clears United States</text>
  <text start="655.39" dur="4.74">of America a battle Graham what this</text>
  <text start="657.82" dur="5.04">means is that the US military can now</text>
  <text start="660.13" dur="6.15">operate with impunity and grant the US</text>
  <text start="662.86" dur="5.97">military the unchecked power to a to</text>
  <text start="666.28" dur="4.95">arrest detain interrogate and even</text>
  <text start="668.83" dur="3.12">assassinate United States citizens with</text>
  <text start="671.23" dur="3.12">impunity</text>
  <text start="671.95" dur="6.69">this just goes along with the NDAA the</text>
  <text start="674.35" dur="9.12">page react the Miranda exception it all</text>
  <text start="678.64" dur="7.83">fits together and also the the executive</text>
  <text start="683.47" dur="4.8">orders that the president can call</text>
  <text start="686.47" dur="5.64">national emergency at any time without</text>
  <text start="688.27" dur="8.28">the backup of Congress so this all plays</text>
  <text start="692.11" dur="7.83">into this completely now on this page on</text>
  <text start="696.55" dur="6.39">the x 22 reports site I put this video</text>
  <text start="699.94" dur="7.22">of where it looks like the police are</text>
  <text start="702.94" dur="7.23">desensitizing using training with eng</text>
  <text start="707.16" dur="5.86">you know practice fighting angry parents</text>
  <text start="710.17" dur="7.35">I mean it doesn&amp;#39;t even make sense what</text>
  <text start="713.02" dur="6.45">we&amp;#39;re doing here and you know there the</text>
  <text start="717.52" dur="4.35">idea was to test the response of police</text>
  <text start="719.47" dur="5">and firefighters to a situation that was</text>
  <text start="721.87" dur="8.6">right out of the news headlines and</text>
  <text start="724.47" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re talking about you know about</text>
  <text start="731.73" dur="5.14">these angry parents taking over a school</text>
  <text start="734.74" dur="4.53">at gunpoint requiring soir intervention</text>
  <text start="736.87" dur="4.08">whenever you ever seen this before I</text>
  <text start="739.27" dur="4.47">mean what are they talking about news</text>
  <text start="740.95" dur="4.2">headlines of angry parents taking over</text>
  <text start="743.74" dur="3.87">the school and they have to come in I</text>
  <text start="745.15" dur="5">mean it doesn&amp;#39;t look like they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="747.61" dur="5.97">through a training to get us used to</text>
  <text start="750.15" dur="6.91">them coming in with guns just like in</text>
  <text start="753.58" dur="5.19">Boston with martial law just like the</text>
  <text start="757.06" dur="4.08">test they have done in other schools</text>
  <text start="758.77" dur="4.29">about that their shooters inside they</text>
  <text start="761.14" dur="4.17">didn&amp;#39;t notify anyone and the police just</text>

  <text start="837.34" dur="6.27">brace for these cyber attacks and there</text>

  <text start="883.29" dur="6.34">they&amp;#39;re linking this now to Iran US</text>
  <text start="887.71" dur="4.41">intelligence officials have said they</text>
  <text start="889.63" dur="7.26">think those attacks were linked to the</text>
  <text start="892.12" dur="6.81">Iranian government and DHS is also</text>
  <text start="896.89" dur="4.71">coming out saying that it&amp;#39;s linked to</text>
  <text start="898.93" dur="6.02">the middle middle east and particularly</text>
  <text start="901.6" dur="7.32">Iran so they are building this up</text>
  <text start="904.95" dur="6.4">because they need to do something and do</text>
  <text start="908.92" dur="6">something quite quickly because we are</text>
  <text start="911.35" dur="5.15">losing ground I mean the government and</text>
  <text start="914.92" dur="8.37">the central bankers are losing ground</text>
  <text start="916.5" dur="12.34">out in Iran Syria and this whole area</text>
  <text start="923.29" dur="8.04">where they want to start a war now they</text>
  <text start="928.84" dur="5.31">tried plan a they tried having the</text>
  <text start="931.33" dur="7.55">rebels going they tried the chemical</text>
  <text start="934.15" dur="6.65">weapons they they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="938.88" dur="4.47">everything they possibly can think of</text>
  <text start="940.8" dur="6.21">they tried the Boston bombing plan a has</text>
  <text start="943.35" dur="7.31">failed no one they can see it these</text>
  <text start="947.01" dur="7.32">stories don&amp;#39;t you know gain any traction</text>
  <text start="950.66" dur="6.61">the American people are so asleep and so</text>
  <text start="954.33" dur="4.86">dazed and so far into their own lives</text>
  <text start="957.27" dur="5.28">that they&amp;#39;re not even noticing what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="959.19" dur="7.23">going on out there so they&amp;#39;re realizing</text>
  <text start="962.55" dur="7.94">this and they need to do something else</text>
  <text start="966.42" dur="7.86">and the only way to do this is to really</text>
  <text start="970.49" dur="5.97">shock the American people and I believe</text>
  <text start="974.28" dur="8.76">they&amp;#39;re going to need to do this soon</text>
  <text start="976.46" dur="9.91">again either with a setting off bombs</text>
  <text start="983.04" dur="5.78">around the country like we saw in Boston</text>
  <text start="986.37" dur="6.45">either with all different type of</text>
  <text start="988.82" dur="7.3">devices or small small little nooks or</text>
  <text start="992.82" dur="6.96">as they&amp;#39;ve been continually talking</text>
  <text start="996.12" dur="6.93">about some type of cyber attack and I do</text>
  <text start="999.78" dur="6.15">believe that we are still going to see</text>
  <text start="1003.05" dur="4.86">this it is still being set up as an</text>
  <text start="1005.93" dur="5.6">event you have to remember coming in a</text>
  <text start="1007.91" dur="6.81">couple of weeks we have this drill in</text>
  <text start="1011.53" dur="8.19">dorney park in May thirteenth we also</text>
  <text start="1014.72" dur="7.59">have the NYPD doing another drill in the</text>
  <text start="1019.72" dur="8.95">subway systems with chemical weapons now</text>
  <text start="1022.31" dur="8.91">in the news we know they talked about</text>
  <text start="1028.67" dur="5.31">chemical weapons with Syria so you have</text>
  <text start="1031.22" dur="6.109">the new york area and if they get hit</text>
  <text start="1033.98" dur="6.57">with some type of chemical weapon</text>
  <text start="1037.329" dur="8.25">disbursement they can blame that on Iran</text>
  <text start="1040.55" dur="8.67">or Syria dorney park there could be</text>
  <text start="1045.579" dur="7.421">small bombs that are set off in crowds</text>
  <text start="1049.22" dur="6.69">of people now they might try these</text>
  <text start="1053" dur="4.8">things first to see you know does it</text>
  <text start="1055.91" dur="4.17">work can we get the people to go to war</text>
  <text start="1057.8" dur="5.13">if we blame it on you know al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="1060.08" dur="5.19">Syria Iran let&amp;#39;s see if we can get them</text>
  <text start="1062.93" dur="4.8">you know moving if that doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="1065.27" dur="7.24">they&amp;#39;re going to have to go for the big</text>
  <text start="1067.73" dur="7.95">one and that could be the cyber attack</text>
  <text start="1072.51" dur="5.58">and they&amp;#39;ve been talking about the</text>
  <text start="1075.68" dur="4.75">electrical grid they&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="1078.09" dur="5.7">about the water systems they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1080.43" dur="5.55">talking about the banks and that might</text>
  <text start="1083.79" dur="3.78">just be the big one or they might skip</text>
  <text start="1085.98" dur="3.27">those other events it might just go</text>
  <text start="1087.57" dur="3.48">right for the big one because it depends</text>
  <text start="1089.25" dur="6.18">on how much time they have and what they</text>
  <text start="1091.05" dur="6.45">need to do I mean but something is</text>
  <text start="1095.43" dur="4.77">definitely coming and they&amp;#39;re setting it</text>
  <text start="1097.5" dur="5.9">up because they need to get the ball</text>
  <text start="1100.2" dur="5.94">rolling on this and this is the only way</text>
  <text start="1103.4" dur="5.5">that I believe they can do this there</text>
  <text start="1106.14" dur="6.81">there is no other way how would we get</text>
  <text start="1108.9" dur="7.68">to war with these countries how would</text>
  <text start="1112.95" dur="6.51">they do it there&amp;#39;s no other conceivable</text>
  <text start="1116.58" dur="5.31">way I mean yes they can plant bombs all</text>
  <text start="1119.46" dur="4.47">across America and they can you know</text>
  <text start="1121.89" dur="4.17">small nukes all over the place that was</text>
  <text start="1123.93" dur="4.11">a report that there are setting up small</text>
  <text start="1126.06" dur="4.61">nukes all over and they can say that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1128.04" dur="5.4">from the Syria or Iran or North Korea</text>
  <text start="1130.67" dur="5.2">the chemical weapons they could do that</text>
  <text start="1133.44" dur="6.42">they could try another small bombing in</text>
  <text start="1135.87" dur="5.52">an amusement park but to really bring it</text>
  <text start="1139.86" dur="3.39">home I mean look what they had to do to</text>
  <text start="1141.39" dur="6.39">get us into Iraq they had to bring down</text>
  <text start="1143.25" dur="7.23">the World Trade Center all the reports</text>
  <text start="1147.78" dur="6">that I&amp;#39;m seeing and everything that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1150.48" dur="6.63">saying is that this cyber attack that</text>
  <text start="1153.78" dur="6.69">continually building the news stories</text>
  <text start="1157.11" dur="5.52">for this huge cyber attack and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1160.47" dur="4.47">really on the people someone said you</text>
  <text start="1162.63" dur="3.69">know did you see red dawn the newer one</text>
  <text start="1164.94" dur="4.23">not the older one with Patrick Swayze</text>
  <text start="1166.32" dur="5.52">the newer one where they used a some</text>
  <text start="1169.17" dur="5.55">type of cyber attack on the power grid</text>
  <text start="1171.84" dur="7.5">they knocked out all the electricity and</text>
  <text start="1174.72" dur="8.1">the North Koreans were able to invade</text>
  <text start="1179.34" dur="7.73">America now the same thing can happen</text>
  <text start="1182.82" dur="6.54">here and I believe that power outage in</text>
  <text start="1187.07" dur="5.56">2003 on the eastern seaboard that was a</text>
  <text start="1189.36" dur="7.35">test that was the test to see can they</text>
  <text start="1192.63" dur="6.9">do it how do the people react and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1196.71" dur="7.14">what they&amp;#39;re going to do and i truly</text>
  <text start="1199.53" dur="6.78">believe that this is the the direction</text>
  <text start="1203.85" dur="4.34">they&amp;#39;re going to go into because they</text>
  <text start="1206.31" dur="5.19">have all these stories coming out</text>

  <text start="1211.5" dur="3.51">American people that this is coming</text>
  <text start="1213.24" dur="4.89">because they could do a lot with a</text>
  <text start="1215.01" dur="6.9">cyberattack they can knock out the</text>
  <text start="1218.13" dur="8.61">electricity for weeks they can drain the</text>
  <text start="1221.91" dur="7.35">banks of money you know which helps a</text>
  <text start="1226.74" dur="4.17">lot with their bail in it also helps</text>
  <text start="1229.26" dur="5.1">blaming it on another country for the</text>
  <text start="1230.91" dur="8.01">economic collapse they can get people so</text>
  <text start="1234.36" dur="7.35">angry not having food water electric /</text>
  <text start="1238.92" dur="3.66">weeks because there was one report that</text>
  <text start="1241.71" dur="2.42">said if they knocked out the</text>
  <text start="1242.58" dur="3.72">Transformers it could be out for six</text>
  <text start="1244.13" dur="3.19">something like six to nine months or</text>
  <text start="1246.3" dur="3.27">something like there were 18 months</text>
  <text start="1247.32" dur="4.89">whatever it was so that&amp;#39;s a very long</text>
  <text start="1249.57" dur="8.07">time even they did it for two weeks holy</text>
