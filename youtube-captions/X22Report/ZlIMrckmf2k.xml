  <text start="109.53" dur="5.009">news and a couple months ago and i</text>
  <text start="112.53" dur="4.229">believe this was in the summer when that</text>
  <text start="114.539" dur="4.381">europe was out there and the french</text>
  <text start="116.759" dur="5.131">president was out there telling everyone</text>
  <text start="118.92" dur="5.4">that the economy is getting better</text>
  <text start="121.89" dur="7.649">they&amp;#39;re pulling out of the recession</text>
  <text start="124.32" dur="11.309">things are fantastic and guess what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="129.539" dur="8.31">all starting to fall apart we saw that</text>
  <text start="135.629" dur="3.601">they the French president said the</text>
  <text start="137.849" dur="2.571">unemployment numbers are going to start</text>
  <text start="139.23" dur="3.65">going down</text>
  <text start="140.42" dur="5.399">he sees great signs of improvement and</text>
  <text start="142.88" dur="6.81">guess what that was a technical glitch</text>
  <text start="145.819" dur="6.511">and France released its August</text>
  <text start="149.69" dur="5.34">jobseekers data in August and it beat</text>
  <text start="152.33" dur="5.4">expectations back then and front jobs</text>
  <text start="155.03" dur="5.7">data is totally screwed up because of</text>
  <text start="157.73" dur="6.39">this glitch that happened and what has</text>
  <text start="160.73" dur="6.089">happened now is they reported a 50,000</text>
  <text start="164.12" dur="7.11">drop last month and it was better than</text>
  <text start="166.819" dur="8.971">you know what they expected and it was</text>
  <text start="171.23" dur="8.009">because a company did not give the</text>
  <text start="175.79" dur="8.6">information and we are now seeing the</text>
  <text start="179.239" dur="9.111">unemployment in France rise 60,000</text>
  <text start="184.39" dur="6.01">unemployed people right now and this is</text>
  <text start="188.35" dur="6.1">increasing at this point and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="190.4" dur="7.2">seeing is they were at 3.23 million back</text>
  <text start="194.45" dur="5.34">in August and this is increased now to</text>
  <text start="197.6" dur="6.24">three point two nine million that are</text>
  <text start="199.79" dur="7.59">now unemployed so unemployment there is</text>
  <text start="203.84" dur="5.67">going up it was complete propaganda do</text>
  <text start="207.38" dur="4.29">you really think they just forgot about</text>
  <text start="209.51" dur="4.68">those numbers no it was all part of the</text>
  <text start="211.67" dur="5.01">same scheme that was going on in Europe</text>
  <text start="214.19" dur="5.94">and in the u.s. because what they</text>
  <text start="216.68" dur="6.179">thought was that they had the Syrian</text>
  <text start="220.13" dur="5.31">event in the bag they thought they were</text>
  <text start="222.859" dur="5.19">going forward with this event we just</text>
  <text start="225.44" dur="5.22">convinced everyone that we&amp;#39;re about to</text>
  <text start="228.049" dur="5.421">recover Europe is recovering the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="230.66" dur="5.549">recovering and we will use this war and</text>
  <text start="233.47" dur="6.43">some type of cyber attack or another</text>
  <text start="236.209" dur="6.81">event to show now that the economy is</text>
  <text start="239.9" dur="5.7">collapsing because of then and we were</text>
  <text start="243.019" dur="4.981">right on the verge of recovering and</text>
  <text start="245.6" dur="5.16">that is completely falling apart and we</text>
  <text start="248" dur="7.31">can see now the truth is actually coming</text>
  <text start="250.76" dur="10.229">out now Citigroup is forecasting that</text>
  <text start="255.31" dur="10.96">Greek Greece Italy Portugal are going to</text>
  <text start="260.989" dur="7.471">go from bad to worse and everyone was</text>
  <text start="266.27" dur="3.81">talking about this rebound in Europe and</text>
  <text start="268.46" dur="3.389">that you know Italy was getting better</text>
  <text start="270.08" dur="3.089">Portugal&amp;#39;s getting better Greece is</text>
  <text start="271.849" dur="2.141">getting better you know they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="273.169" dur="3.551">going to need any more</text>
  <text start="273.99" dur="6.51">outs Cyprus had their balance their fine</text>
  <text start="276.72" dur="5.64">and a bailout and they&amp;#39;re fine and we</text>
  <text start="280.5" dur="4.71">don&amp;#39;t have to worry about them but what</text>
  <text start="282.36" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now Citigroup is out</text>
  <text start="285.21" dur="5.61">there saying that Italy will bounce</text>
  <text start="287.67" dur="6.69">along and near permanent recession there</text>
  <text start="290.82" dur="7.86">is no economic growth or sovereign</text>
  <text start="294.36" dur="8.85">currency Portugal isn&amp;#39;t an even worse</text>
  <text start="298.68" dur="8.49">state unemployment rising again to 18.3</text>
  <text start="303.21" dur="9.63">percent and beyond Greece continues to</text>
  <text start="307.17" dur="9.23">be a catastrophe Spain unemployment will</text>
  <text start="312.84" dur="7.95">now rise above twenty seven point nine</text>
  <text start="316.4" dur="7.6">percent and Europe is facing a lost</text>
  <text start="320.79" dur="6.09">decade that is far worse than anything</text>
  <text start="324" dur="7.98">suffered by Japan and we can see that</text>
  <text start="326.88" dur="7.44">this entire scam of things that are</text>
  <text start="331.98" dur="5.01">getting better are now declining and</text>
  <text start="334.32" dur="5.94">what they are doing is they are</text>
  <text start="336.99" dur="6.12">preparing for something to explain why</text>
  <text start="340.26" dur="4.59">all this is happening and it will not be</text>
  <text start="343.11" dur="3.81">what everyone thinks they&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="344.85" dur="6.24">going to let the country&amp;#39;s collapse know</text>
  <text start="346.92" dur="5.43">what the central Baker&amp;#39;s globalists the</text>
  <text start="351.09" dur="3.93">elite whatever you want to call them</text>
  <text start="352.35" dur="5.61">they will get out of this whole entire</text>
  <text start="355.02" dur="8.52">thing by starting a war and blaming it</text>
  <text start="357.96" dur="8.55">on the war so what else are we saying</text>
  <text start="363.54" dur="5.79">well the eurozone debt levels sewer</text>
  <text start="366.51" dur="4.83">again in second quarter official figures</text>
  <text start="369.33" dur="4.98">show that the debt level in the eurozone</text>
  <text start="371.34" dur="7.46">has risen further in the 2nd quarter of</text>
  <text start="374.31" dur="8.16">2013 despite years of harsh austerity</text>
  <text start="378.8" dur="6.82">aimed at improving the economies and we</text>
  <text start="382.47" dur="6.86">can see as an example of Greece they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="385.62" dur="7.74">had huge amounts of austerity cutting</text>
  <text start="389.33" dur="6.25">expenses laying off people and guess</text>
  <text start="393.36" dur="4.53">where that has got them that has got</text>
  <text start="395.58" dur="5.64">them too coming up for a third bailout</text>
  <text start="397.89" dur="6.98">there are so many people unemployed that</text>
  <text start="401.22" dur="6.66">the country is just imploding on itself</text>
  <text start="404.87" dur="4.54">but again the central bankers</text>
  <text start="407.88" dur="4.32">want this because this gives them the</text>
  <text start="409.41" dur="6.03">opportunity to come in and steal the</text>
  <text start="412.2" dur="7.44">natural resources of the countries that</text>
  <text start="415.44" dur="6.48">oh so much debt and you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="419.64" dur="5.52">seeing this all over the place in Europe</text>
  <text start="421.92" dur="6.15">we&amp;#39;re seeing it in the US and every</text>
  <text start="425.16" dur="5.45">single country is adding more and more</text>
  <text start="428.07" dur="7.35">debt and this is completely</text>
  <text start="430.61" dur="7.72">unsustainable at this time and a report</text>
  <text start="435.42" dur="5.76">that was released the combined debt for</text>
  <text start="438.33" dur="4.89">the 17-member currency bloc hit 90</text>
  <text start="441.18" dur="7.02">three-point-four percent of gross</text>
  <text start="443.22" dur="7.35">domestic product so what does this tell</text>
  <text start="448.2" dur="4.92">us it tells us that things are not</text>
  <text start="450.57" dur="6.3">getting better the propaganda during the</text>
  <text start="453.12" dur="8.15">summer was just that propaganda now in</text>
  <text start="456.87" dur="7.41">the u.s. October this month the US</text>
  <text start="461.27" dur="7.93">manufacturing output tumbles to two</text>
  <text start="464.28" dur="8">thousand nine levels so that shows us</text>
  <text start="469.2" dur="7.59">that the manufacturing of the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="472.28" dur="6.67">completely declining at this time now i</text>
  <text start="476.79" dur="4.68">know i mentioned real estate quite a bit</text>
  <text start="478.95" dur="5.04">but here we go again we have the</text>
  <text start="481.47" dur="5.04">propaganda of europe in the summer</text>
  <text start="483.99" dur="3.99">telling us everything is fantastic we</text>
  <text start="486.51" dur="3.72">have the propaganda in the united states</text>
  <text start="487.98" dur="3.75">and the president going around telling</text>
  <text start="490.23" dur="3.41">us that housings making this huge</text>
  <text start="491.73" dur="5.97">rebound and everyone should be happy</text>
  <text start="493.64" dur="7.56">well bank of america now is eliminating</text>
  <text start="497.7" dur="8.13">another thirteen hundred mortgage jobs</text>
  <text start="501.2" dur="7.38">again if the real estate industry was so</text>
  <text start="505.83" dur="5.16">great and every Americans out there</text>
  <text start="508.58" dur="4.36">buying homes they would be getting</text>
  <text start="510.99" dur="5.19">mortgages and if they are buying</text>
  <text start="512.94" dur="7.56">mortgages guess what they would hire</text>
  <text start="516.18" dur="6.96">more people to handle the volume of</text>
  <text start="520.5" dur="6.93">people coming in purchasing the homes</text>
  <text start="523.14" dur="7.17">but guess what it&amp;#39;s not people that are</text>
  <text start="527.43" dur="5.58">purchasing the homes so since the people</text>
  <text start="530.31" dur="4.41">aren&amp;#39;t taking out mortgages they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="533.01" dur="3.48">need people in the mortgage departments</text>
  <text start="534.72" dur="4.07">so what do they do with them they get</text>
  <text start="536.49" dur="5.37">rid of them because who are the people</text>
  <text start="538.79" dur="7.12">that are purchasing right now well</text>
  <text start="541.86" dur="6.81">normal Americans as we know a lot of</text>
  <text start="545.91" dur="4.77">them foreclosed on their homes and we</text>
  <text start="548.67" dur="3.87">know this because the Fed is still</text>
  <text start="550.68" dur="6.24">buying up all that toxic real estate</text>
  <text start="552.54" dur="7.289">from the banks so we know there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="556.92" dur="5.7">of foreclosed inventory on the banks</text>
  <text start="559.829" dur="4.861">books that they&amp;#39;re not releasing we</text>
  <text start="562.62" dur="6.899">understand there are huge amounts of</text>
  <text start="564.69" dur="9">short sales and because of all of this</text>
  <text start="569.519" dur="8.491">we also understand that Americans are</text>
  <text start="573.69" dur="6.5">unemployed or underemployed and the</text>
  <text start="578.01" dur="6.09">unemployment numbers are completely</text>
  <text start="580.19" dur="8.26">manipulated to make it seem like America</text>
  <text start="584.1" dur="5.97">is working but we are not now since all</text>
  <text start="588.45" dur="3.9">these people are not working or</text>
  <text start="590.07" dur="4.5">underemployed or foreclosed and have</text>
  <text start="592.35" dur="6.06">short sales guess what happens to their</text>
  <text start="594.57" dur="6">credit their credit is shot if their</text>
  <text start="598.41" dur="5.46">credit is shot how are they getting</text>
  <text start="600.57" dur="5.73">mortgages let&amp;#39;s go down to the younger</text>
  <text start="603.87" dur="4.68">people here if these people who are</text>
  <text start="606.3" dur="3.93">coming out of college can&amp;#39;t find work</text>
  <text start="608.55" dur="4.95">because the unemployment for use is</text>
  <text start="610.23" dur="5.729">around forty to fifty percent they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="613.5" dur="5.85">find work in their industry pay is much</text>
  <text start="615.959" dur="5.761">lower these people cannot buy homes so</text>
  <text start="619.35" dur="6.75">who are these people buying the homes</text>
  <text start="621.72" dur="7.859">well they are the investment companies</text>
  <text start="626.1" dur="8.31">they are hedge funds they are all of</text>
  <text start="629.579" dur="8.7">these people that are using cash to</text>
  <text start="634.41" dur="6.419">purchase these homes and institutional</text>
  <text start="638.279" dur="6.81">investors accounted for fourteen percent</text>
  <text start="640.829" dur="9.45">of all sales and September up from nine</text>
  <text start="645.089" dur="8.131">percent in August all cash purchases</text>
  <text start="650.279" dur="6.381">nationwide represented forty-nine</text>
  <text start="653.22" dur="7.08">percent of all residential sales in</text>
  <text start="656.66" dur="5.859">September up from a revised forty</text>
  <text start="660.3" dur="4.89">percent in August and up from thirty</text>
  <text start="662.519" dur="5.971">percent all going all the way back to</text>
  <text start="665.19" dur="6.959">September of 2012 12 so you can see what</text>
  <text start="668.49" dur="7.909">they were doing here these investors</text>
  <text start="672.149" dur="7.44">were using cash bypassing</text>
  <text start="676.399" dur="4.81">mortgages and this is why we see the</text>
  <text start="679.589" dur="4.171">mortgage companies laying off because</text>
  <text start="681.209" dur="4.771">the everyday American cannot buy these</text>
  <text start="683.76" dur="4.74">homes they were trying to pump up the</text>
  <text start="685.98" dur="5.419">market and guess what happened their</text>
  <text start="688.5" dur="6.329">plan failed the housing market is</text>
  <text start="691.399" dur="6.011">declining it is imploding on itself and</text>
  <text start="694.829" dur="4.741">these institutional investors and hedge</text>
  <text start="697.41" dur="6.539">funds are trying to get out of the</text>
  <text start="699.57" dur="6.81">market at this time and this goes on to</text>
  <text start="703.949" dur="5.13">say the housing market continues to skew</text>
  <text start="706.38" dur="4.68">in favor of investors particularly deep</text>
  <text start="709.079" dur="5.641">pocketed institutional investors and</text>
  <text start="711.06" dur="5.73">other buyers paying with cash and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="714.72" dur="8.09">seeing this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="716.79" dur="10.229">now okay now the US bank liquidity</text>
  <text start="722.81" dur="7.42">liquidity plan is going forward right</text>
  <text start="727.019" dur="5.341">now and what the Fed wants and they want</text>
  <text start="730.23" dur="5.52">the banks to do this as quickly as</text>
  <text start="732.36" dur="6.87">possible they want the banks to hold</text>
  <text start="735.75" dur="7.62">enough assets they can easily sell to</text>
  <text start="739.23" dur="6.719">survive a credit crunch they&amp;#39;re calling</text>
  <text start="743.37" dur="6.089">on all US banks to meet the new</text>
  <text start="745.949" dur="5.101">liquidity standards right now the</text>
  <text start="749.459" dur="3.451">proposal which tells banks to hold</text>
  <text start="751.05" dur="5.519">enough liquid assets to me their cash</text>
  <text start="752.91" dur="7.89">needs for 30 days if there is some type</text>
  <text start="756.569" dur="6.811">of problem and regulators said that the</text>
  <text start="760.8" dur="5.039">liquid liquidity rules will ensure that</text>
  <text start="763.38" dur="4.649">in a crunch banks would have enough</text>
  <text start="765.839" dur="5.071">government debt and other easy to sell</text>
  <text start="768.029" dur="5.731">assets on hand to cope with customer</text>
  <text start="770.91" dur="5.7">withdrawals post collateral and meet</text>
  <text start="773.76" dur="6.3">other needs now why would they be doing</text>

  <text start="786.36" dur="4.05">which we know that&amp;#39;s not true the Fed</text>
  <text start="788.43" dur="3.48">was blaming the government shutdown is</text>
  <text start="790.41" dur="3.539">the reason why they weren&amp;#39;t going to</text>

  <text start="793.949" dur="3.721">the government shutdown so we know this</text>
  <text start="796.05" dur="3.81">is all false and we know this all goes</text>
  <text start="797.67" dur="4.14">back that they were hoping that this</text>
  <text start="799.86" dur="4.02">event would occur where they could blame</text>
  <text start="801.81" dur="4.91">it on another country for the collapse</text>

  <text start="868.05" dur="3">this is going to be a tough case for</text>
  <text start="869.37" dur="4.32">them just to go ahead and say we got to</text>
  <text start="871.05" dur="4.11">increase QE because they were telling us</text>
  <text start="873.69" dur="3.24">how well everything&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="875.16" dur="3.42">unemployment&amp;#39;s coming down that we see</text>
  <text start="876.93" dur="3.18">because they&amp;#39;re manipulating the numbers</text>

  <text start="882.69" dur="5.4">increase QE they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="884.88" dur="5.94">have a really good reason and some other</text>
  <text start="888.09" dur="4.77">thing to blame it on and this is what</text>
  <text start="890.82" dur="4.47">I&amp;#39;ve been talking about all along I do</text>
  <text start="892.86" dur="5.46">believe that we are going to see an</text>
  <text start="895.29" dur="5.79">event which will allow them to blame</text>
  <text start="898.32" dur="5.24">this on another country of why they need</text>
  <text start="901.08" dur="4.44">to increase QE because they understand I</text>
  <text start="903.56" dur="3.82">mean we have to think about it why do</text>
  <text start="905.52" dur="4.1">they want to increase QE well they</text>
  <text start="907.38" dur="5.52">understand the housing market is</text>
  <text start="909.62" dur="5.56">imploding they know it they absolutely</text>
  <text start="912.9" dur="5.16">know it I mean if we there was an</text>
  <text start="915.18" dur="4.56">article that alan greenspan knew that</text>
  <text start="918.06" dur="4.53">there was a housing bubble there just</text>
  <text start="919.74" dur="5.34">admitting it now they never tell you</text>
  <text start="922.59" dur="5.07">what&amp;#39;s really going on they always tell</text>
  <text start="925.08" dur="5.22">you the opposite but we know the housing</text>
  <text start="927.66" dur="5.34">market is coming down we know the</text>
  <text start="930.3" dur="6.15">economy is declining we know that this</text>
  <text start="933" dur="5.67">debt that we have is unsustainable the</text>
  <text start="936.45" dur="4.82">debt and Europe unsustainable this is</text>
  <text start="938.67" dur="5">why the country&amp;#39;s the unemployment</text>
  <text start="941.27" dur="4.92">the outlook of every single country</text>
  <text start="943.67" dur="5.79">there is worse than they expected</text>
  <text start="946.19" dur="5.04">because they are using propaganda back</text>
  <text start="949.46" dur="3.9">in the summer to convince everything</text>
  <text start="951.23" dur="5.97">everyone that things were getting better</text>
  <text start="953.36" dur="6.45">but now we see that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="957.2" dur="5.1">need to increase the creation of money</text>
  <text start="959.81" dur="3.54">why because if the housing market is</text>
  <text start="962.3" dur="3.87">declining that means there&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="963.35" dur="5.1">foreclosures more foreclosures they have</text>
  <text start="966.17" dur="6.06">a lot more to buy from the banks to take</text>
  <text start="968.45" dur="6.72">them off their books and what else will</text>
  <text start="972.23" dur="4.5">happen now well other foreign nations</text>
  <text start="975.17" dur="3.87">will see what is happening and that the</text>
  <text start="976.73" dur="4.44">economy is declining and most of them</text>
  <text start="979.04" dur="4.65">will start to think like hmmm should we</text>
  <text start="981.17" dur="5.28">hold on to these Treasury bonds well</text>
  <text start="983.69" dur="4.92">probably not so they will start turning</text>
  <text start="986.45" dur="4.35">them in and sending them back to the US</text>
  <text start="988.61" dur="4.86">and if there&amp;#39;s a seller there has to be</text>
  <text start="990.8" dur="4.68">a buyer so the Fed will have to start</text>
  <text start="993.47" dur="6.36">purchasing these Treasury bonds we also</text>
  <text start="995.48" dur="6.96">see Saudi Arabia looking to move away</text>
  <text start="999.83" dur="5.91">from the US at this point why because</text>
  <text start="1002.44" dur="5.85">most of their oil sales are now to China</text>
  <text start="1005.74" dur="4.77">and a very little bit are to the US and</text>
  <text start="1008.29" dur="3.68">they&amp;#39;re thinking to themselves where do</text>
  <text start="1010.51" dur="3.81">they want to be because of the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1011.97" dur="5.68">collapses and they&amp;#39;re holding all these</text>
  <text start="1014.32" dur="6.24">dollars and they&amp;#39;re hooked to the dollar</text>
  <text start="1017.65" dur="5.49">to sell their oil they&amp;#39;re going to be in</text>
  <text start="1020.56" dur="6">very big trouble so now they&amp;#39;re thinking</text>
  <text start="1023.14" dur="7.5">hmm maybe we need to strike a deal with</text>
  <text start="1026.56" dur="7.71">China and and move away and just protect</text>
  <text start="1030.64" dur="5.79">ourselves just in case not just in case</text>
  <text start="1034.27" dur="4.05">but we know this is going to happen that</text>
  <text start="1036.43" dur="7.8">this will when this happens we have</text>
  <text start="1038.32" dur="7.86">another place to go okay now a federal</text>

  <text start="1156.19" dur="6.869">is the Constitution it is the right of</text>

  <text start="1203.47" dur="5.38">of the country so that&amp;#39;s the real threat</text>
  <text start="1205.78" dur="6.25">here it is obviously the Constitution</text>
  <text start="1208.85" dur="6.24">is the fundamental law of America and of</text>
  <text start="1212.03" dur="4.47">our land but if for some reason this</text>
  <text start="1215.09" dur="4.2">treaty should be signed and then</text>
  <text start="1216.5" dur="5.94">ratified by 67 senators then it Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1219.29" dur="8.49">American law this is kind of wrong</text>
  <text start="1222.44" dur="9.24">because the treaty violates the</text>

  <text start="1231.68" dur="7.29">the Constitution cannot become law of</text>

  <text start="1447.559" dur="5.671">is undetected on radar screens this</text>
  <text start="1450.47" dur="6.689">destroyer will be deployed in the</text>
  <text start="1453.23" dur="9.99">Pacific area and the battleships are</text>
  <text start="1457.159" dur="8.941">also being deployed in this area and why</text>
  <text start="1463.22" dur="5.459">are they being deployed if their role is</text>
  <text start="1466.1" dur="6.54">to keep at bay China which seeks to</text>
  <text start="1468.679" dur="7.531">become a military super power and this</text>
  <text start="1472.64" dur="3.869">new ship this new destroyer that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1476.21" dur="3.829">create</text>
  <text start="1476.509" dur="6.39">that itself is state-of-the-art</text>
  <text start="1480.039" dur="5.08">automated system and the ship now only</text>
  <text start="1482.899" dur="4.47">needs a hundred and fifty members to run</text>
  <text start="1485.119" dur="5.49">it and that&amp;#39;s about half of what they</text>
  <text start="1487.369" dur="6.69">normally need on a ship so we can see</text>
  <text start="1490.609" dur="5.67">what is happening at this point now a</text>
  <text start="1494.059" dur="5.1">couple reports ago I reported that</text>
  <text start="1496.279" dur="5.76">Turkey was taking the deal with China to</text>
  <text start="1499.159" dur="7.29">supply the missiles even know turkey is</text>
  <text start="1502.039" dur="6.87">a NATO country and Washington is very</text>
  <text start="1506.449" dur="4.65">upset about this and they&amp;#39;re making kind</text>
  <text start="1508.909" dur="4.11">of a stink and they are very concerned</text>
  <text start="1511.099" dur="3.87">and this goes on to say that we are very</text>
  <text start="1513.019" dur="4.77">concerned about the perspective deal</text>
  <text start="1514.969" dur="4.95">with the sanction Chinese firm yes this</text>
  <text start="1517.789" dur="4.17">is a commercial decision it is Turkey&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1519.919" dur="4.29">sovereign right but we are concerned</text>
  <text start="1521.959" dur="5.49">about what it means for allied air</text>
  <text start="1524.209" dur="6.12">defence and because turkey is in a</text>
  <text start="1527.449" dur="4.95">strategic location they are very worried</text>
  <text start="1530.329" dur="4.23">about how this is going to work out</text>
  <text start="1532.399" dur="5.34">because they understand that they are</text>
  <text start="1534.559" dur="6.12">preparing for World War three and they</text>
  <text start="1537.739" dur="6.36">understand they need turkey on their</text>
  <text start="1540.679" dur="7.86">side and Turkey has now turned to China</text>
  <text start="1544.099" dur="6.78">to supply them with missiles and we also</text>
  <text start="1548.539" dur="7.49">have to remember China has been making</text>
  <text start="1550.879" dur="7.83">deals all over the globe to push their</text>
  <text start="1556.029" dur="4.84">currency and to make it the reserve</text>
  <text start="1558.709" dur="4.14">currency of the world they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1560.869" dur="3.99">making deals in Europe they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1562.849" dur="3.75">making deals in Africa they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1564.859" dur="4.32">making deals in Australia they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1566.599" dur="4.77">making deals in Brazil and we can see</text>
  <text start="1569.179" dur="6.27">what is happening here the United States</text>
  <text start="1571.369" dur="7.47">has military forces all throughout the</text>
  <text start="1575.449" dur="6.9">Middle East and we hear these drone</text>
  <text start="1578.839" dur="6.21">strikes happening all the time and what</text>
  <text start="1582.349" dur="5.82">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now the CIA has a</text>
  <text start="1585.049" dur="6.391">secret pact with Pakistan and Pakistani</text>
  <text start="1588.169" dur="5.58">government allows them to do these drone</text>
  <text start="1591.44" dur="4.769">strikes because we understand that the</text>
  <text start="1593.749" dur="5.01">government there is a puppet regime that</text>
  <text start="1596.209" dur="3.9">works for the US and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1598.759" dur="4.5">actually doing with these drone strikes</text>
  <text start="1600.109" dur="7.71">are keeping the people pushed back</text>
  <text start="1603.259" dur="6.6">because they do not want them to rise up</text>
  <text start="1607.819" dur="2.591">and overthrow the government because if</text>
  <text start="1609.859" dur="2.081">they do</text>
  <text start="1610.41" dur="4.14">what will that what will end up</text>
  <text start="1611.94" dur="5.01">happening is they will push the central</text>
  <text start="1614.55" dur="5.55">bankers out and the US dollar will no</text>
  <text start="1616.95" dur="5.7">longer be the reserve currency in these</text>
  <text start="1620.1" dur="7.41">countries and this is the reason for the</text>
  <text start="1622.65" dur="7.47">drone strikes the only reason we saw</text>
  <text start="1627.51" dur="4.92">this happen in Iran back in the 70s</text>
  <text start="1630.12" dur="5.01">where the central bankers were pushed</text>
  <text start="1632.43" dur="6.45">out in that country no longer and Syria</text>
  <text start="1635.13" dur="9.03">no longer sell their oil using the US</text>
  <text start="1638.88" dur="8.04">dollar and the u.s. is using this tactic</text>
  <text start="1644.16" dur="5.31">to keep all these countries controlled</text>
  <text start="1646.92" dur="7.89">so they can continually keep the US</text>
  <text start="1649.47" dur="8.94">dollar propped up now what has happened</text>
  <text start="1654.81" dur="6.09">in Syria is like a worst-case scenario</text>
  <text start="1658.41" dur="6.42">for what was what what they were trying</text>
  <text start="1660.9" dur="7.62">to do the rebel paid mercenary forces</text>
  <text start="1664.83" dur="7.08">have been pushed back Assad is winning</text>
  <text start="1668.52" dur="5.85">the US is really not supporting them</text>
  <text start="1671.91" dur="8.7">anymore they&amp;#39;re being pushed back and</text>
  <text start="1674.37" dur="11.31">right now they&amp;#39;re the u.s. strategy in</text>
  <text start="1680.61" dur="7.74">Syria has gone completely from good to</text>
  <text start="1685.68" dur="6.81">worse and Assad and his allies are</text>
  <text start="1688.35" dur="8.16">pushing forward so their plan is still</text>
  <text start="1692.49" dur="7.17">to get Assad to get a puppet government</text>
  <text start="1696.51" dur="4.56">in Syria to get a puppet government in</text>
  <text start="1699.66" dur="3.36">Iran like they&amp;#39;re doing to all these</text>
  <text start="1701.07" dur="3.69">other countries and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1703.02" dur="6.3">have to do something soon and this is</text>
  <text start="1704.76" dur="7.68">why in my other reports about false flag</text>
  <text start="1709.32" dur="6.03">events coming things like that because</text>
  <text start="1712.44" dur="5.1">they are becoming desperate now they are</text>
  <text start="1715.35" dur="5.13">making their move they are planning</text>
  <text start="1717.54" dur="5.19">something right now and this is why you</text>
  <text start="1720.48" dur="6.33">see all the propaganda about terrorism</text>
  <text start="1722.73" dur="5.76">about al-qaeda about al-shabaab this is</text>
  <text start="1726.81" dur="2.94">why we&amp;#39;re seeing all this this is why</text>
  <text start="1728.49" dur="3.39">we&amp;#39;re seeing the propaganda about</text>
  <text start="1729.75" dur="6.78">nuclear weapons that are being</text>
  <text start="1731.88" dur="6.93">transferred why officers who are in</text>
  <text start="1736.53" dur="4.77">charge of the nuclear arsenal being</text>
  <text start="1738.81" dur="5.04">relieved of their command and we can see</text>
  <text start="1741.3" dur="5.28">what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="1743.85" dur="7.05">they are making and planning and putting</text>
  <text start="1746.58" dur="7.349">everything into what they need to do to</text>
  <text start="1750.9" dur="8.67">get this war started they will not give</text>
  <text start="1753.929" dur="9.331">up if you think it&amp;#39;s over it is not okay</text>
  <text start="1759.57" dur="5.7">now we understand that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1763.26" dur="3.96">filling us with the propaganda of cyber</text>
  <text start="1765.27" dur="6.69">attacks hitting the power grid and what</text>
  <text start="1767.22" dur="7.53">not there was a cyber attack and they</text>
  <text start="1771.96" dur="5.19">believe it&amp;#39;s from Russia and again I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1774.75" dur="4.89">go through this again you can only see</text>
  <text start="1777.15" dur="5.69">the last country that the attack came</text>
  <text start="1779.64" dur="8.07">from where the server was located</text>
  <text start="1782.84" dur="7.15">professional hackers who do attacks do</text>
  <text start="1787.71" dur="4.17">not sit there in their home on their</text>
  <text start="1789.99" dur="4.26">server and their attack comes from their</text>
  <text start="1791.88" dur="4.5">server they bounce it off many different</text>
  <text start="1794.25" dur="5.429">servers and you can really only see the</text>
  <text start="1796.38" dur="5.45">last place it came so on this instance</text>
  <text start="1799.679" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re a a cyber attack</text>
  <text start="1801.83" dur="6.31">was based in Russia and has forced a</text>
  <text start="1805.679" dur="4.651">shutdown of the clay center public</text>
  <text start="1808.14" dur="5.25">utilities computer system and this is</text>
  <text start="1810.33" dur="5.579">according to bill Callaway who heads up</text>
  <text start="1813.39" dur="5.25">the public utilities in this area and</text>
  <text start="1815.909" dur="5.941">the clay centers computer was one of the</text>
  <text start="1818.64" dur="5.159">number of all was one of a number of all</text>
  <text start="1821.85" dur="4.319">over the world involving a virus</text>
  <text start="1823.799" dur="5.601">demanding a ransom payment under threat</text>
  <text start="1826.169" dur="7.201">of destroying data files on the computer</text>
  <text start="1829.4" dur="5.11">so this virus got in there it there were</text>
  <text start="1833.37" dur="3.33">threatening that they were going to</text>
  <text start="1834.51" dur="5.159">destroy everything unless they paid up</text>
  <text start="1836.7" dur="4.709">and IT experts say the city&amp;#39;s computers</text>
  <text start="1839.669" dur="3.901">will have to be completely erased and</text>
  <text start="1841.409" dur="3.991">data from backup systems used to restore</text>
  <text start="1843.57" dur="4.17">the system and the process will take</text>
  <text start="1845.4" dur="5.009">several days and the computer system</text>
  <text start="1847.74" dur="6.66">operating the city power plant was not</text>
  <text start="1850.409" dur="6.481">affected at this time and Callaway</text>
  <text start="1854.4" dur="5.34">saying that the National Grid is really</text>
  <text start="1856.89" dur="5.1">vulnerable to attack and he said that</text>
  <text start="1859.74" dur="4.65">power companies particularly large</text>
  <text start="1861.99" dur="4.71">companies are reluctant to talk about</text>
  <text start="1864.39" dur="5.1">the cyber vulnerability for fear of</text>
  <text start="1866.7" dur="6.33">frightening customers and investors but</text>
  <text start="1869.49" dur="5.49">he said not discussing the issue openly</text>
  <text start="1873.03" dur="4.59">makes things a lot worse</text>
  <text start="1874.98" dur="5.37">and he says the big companies are</text>
  <text start="1877.62" dur="5.16">constantly being attacked but they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1880.35" dur="5.1">want to talk about it but that makes</text>
  <text start="1882.78" dur="7.71">everybody vulnerable and we can see what</text>
  <text start="1885.45" dur="8.43">is happening the the propaganda of the</text>
  <text start="1890.49" dur="6.29">power grid going down has grown we can</text>
  <text start="1893.88" dur="6.21">see that they&amp;#39;re starting to test and</text>
  <text start="1896.78" dur="4.96">attack different areas and to see how it</text>
  <text start="1900.09" dur="5.52">works and I believe if we go back to</text>
  <text start="1901.74" dur="7.26">2003 that whole East Coast power outage</text>
  <text start="1905.61" dur="5.34">that we saw was completely done as a</text>
  <text start="1909" dur="4.44">test to see if they were able to bring</text>
  <text start="1910.95" dur="4.71">down a grid and they were able to do it</text>
  <text start="1913.44" dur="5.1">and I believe what is happening right</text>
  <text start="1915.66" dur="5.99">now is we&amp;#39;ve been seeing many many</text>
  <text start="1918.54" dur="6.629">glitches in the NASDAQ and the internet</text>

  <text start="1938.7" dur="4.59">power grid the financial institutions</text>
  <text start="1940.86" dur="4.439">and it will be devastating and we know</text>
