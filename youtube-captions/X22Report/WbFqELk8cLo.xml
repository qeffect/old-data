  <text start="99.34" dur="5.4">economy&amp;#39;s doing well trying to get the</text>
  <text start="102.1" dur="4.89">mainstream media to acknowledge the</text>

  <text start="143.02" dur="5.76">is doing fantastic only if the</text>
  <text start="145.209" dur="6.691">mainstream media would recognize this he</text>
  <text start="148.78" dur="7.26">wants the mainstream media to recognize</text>
  <text start="151.9" dur="6.809">that he has taken the old economy that</text>
  <text start="156.04" dur="5.21">Obama was running and made it incredible</text>
  <text start="158.709" dur="5.171">the question is why is he doing this</text>

  <text start="176.05" dur="9.25">this is going to be one gigantic set up</text>
  <text start="180.17" dur="7.5">and the set up is to point the finger at</text>
  <text start="185.3" dur="4.05">the Federal Reserve that&amp;#39;s what this is</text>
  <text start="187.67" dur="4.8">all about and not just the Federal</text>
  <text start="189.35" dur="5.07">Reserve but essential banks around the</text>
  <text start="192.47" dur="4.68">world and when I say the central banks I</text>
  <text start="194.42" dur="4.77">mean the private central banks which are</text>
  <text start="197.15" dur="5.1">controlled by the Rothschild this is why</text>
  <text start="199.19" dur="6.12">Kew filled us in on all the central</text>
  <text start="202.25" dur="5.55">banks around the world and made it clear</text>
  <text start="205.31" dur="5.97">that these central banks they are</text>
  <text start="207.8" dur="6.93">controlled by the Rothschilds but in</text>
  <text start="211.28" dur="6.6">reality he knows the economy can only</text>
  <text start="214.73" dur="6.06">last a certain period of time under this</text>
  <text start="217.88" dur="7.17">central bank illusion and he knows he</text>
  <text start="220.79" dur="6.45">only has a small window yes can he</text>
  <text start="225.05" dur="5.52">continually kick the can down the street</text>
  <text start="227.24" dur="5.46">of course he can he can make the numbers</text>
  <text start="230.57" dur="3.51">look fantastic the central banks have</text>
  <text start="232.7" dur="4.14">been doing this for a very long time</text>
  <text start="234.08" dur="4.59">he&amp;#39;s just taking control over the</text>
  <text start="236.84" dur="4.47">problem and the same problem with the</text>
  <text start="238.67" dur="4.5">central banks is that the people will</text>
  <text start="241.31" dur="5.61">start to feel it and many people are</text>
  <text start="243.17" dur="6.45">feeling it and when the people start to</text>
  <text start="246.92" dur="5.61">feel it this is when you lose the</text>
  <text start="249.62" dur="4.95">illusion now we are definitely seeing</text>
  <text start="252.53" dur="4.47">this in the real estate market we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="254.57" dur="4.77">seen it in retail we&amp;#39;ve seen that retail</text>

  <text start="259.34" dur="4.62">they are we&amp;#39;re seeing it in real estate</text>
  <text start="261.98" dur="4.5">things are rapidly falling apart and</text>
  <text start="263.96" dur="5.31">Trump knows he has this small window of</text>
  <text start="266.48" dur="4.47">time and he needs to control the</text>
  <text start="269.27" dur="4.5">narrative which he is to blame</text>
  <text start="270.95" dur="4.83">everything on the central bank now if we</text>
  <text start="273.77" dur="5.6">look at some of the real estate we can</text>
  <text start="275.78" dur="6.78">see that things are deteriorating very</text>
  <text start="279.37" dur="7.24">very quickly look at New York for</text>
  <text start="282.56" dur="8.67">instance 52% of the homes listed for</text>
  <text start="286.61" dur="7.05">sale last spring still have not sold for</text>
  <text start="291.23" dur="5.939">sellers the situation calls very clear</text>
  <text start="293.66" dur="5.849">strategy to cut prices over a half</text>
  <text start="297.169" dur="4.411">12,000 plus homes that were listed for</text>
  <text start="299.509" dur="4.081">sale New York City on street easy during</text>

  <text start="303.59" dur="10.049">May 2018 still have not sold as of early</text>
  <text start="308.509" dur="6.81">February now in Manhattan we see 56% of</text>
  <text start="313.639" dur="4.89">the homes listed in March April and May</text>
  <text start="315.319" dur="6.57">of 2018 have not yet sold what makes</text>
  <text start="318.529" dur="6.931">buyers reluctant are the prices that are</text>
  <text start="321.889" dur="6">declining the street easy medium price</text>
  <text start="325.46" dur="4.41">index for Manhattan at one point one</text>
  <text start="327.889" dur="4.74">thirty two million December is back</text>
  <text start="329.87" dur="5.19">where had been in September 2015 for the</text>
  <text start="332.629" dur="4.771">past six months in a row the median</text>
  <text start="335.06" dur="4.439">price index for Manhattan has fallen</text>
  <text start="337.4" dur="4.379">below the same month a year earlier</text>
  <text start="339.499" dur="5.491">these are the first such eurovia</text>
  <text start="341.779" dur="7.98">declines since home since housing bust</text>
  <text start="344.99" dur="6.44">number one so the higher the price the</text>
  <text start="349.759" dur="5.33">harder it gets</text>
  <text start="351.43" dur="6.37">buyers just like they did during</text>
  <text start="355.089" dur="6.76">2007-2008 they don&amp;#39;t want to pay a</text>
  <text start="357.8" dur="7.91">premium on the homes homes listed at</text>
  <text start="361.849" dur="7.38">less than 1 million 45% failed to sell</text>

  <text start="372.05" dur="7.2">million or more 79 percent failed to</text>
  <text start="375.199" dur="6.81">sell you can see that it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="379.25" dur="6.779">affect the real estate market now this</text>
  <text start="382.009" dur="7.25">is going to move down the price range we</text>
  <text start="386.029" dur="5.82">saw this happen back in 2006 going into</text>
  <text start="389.259" dur="5.821">2007-2008 it started at the higher</text>
  <text start="391.849" dur="7.201">priced homes and then it moved down to</text>
  <text start="395.08" dur="6.299">the lower priced homes and this took</text>
  <text start="399.05" dur="5.339">some time but they eventually got there</text>
  <text start="401.379" dur="7.53">we&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing happen once</text>
  <text start="404.389" dur="8.31">again Trump knows that he only has a</text>
  <text start="408.909" dur="7">small window to make this transition and</text>
  <text start="412.699" dur="5.761">they are working very very quickly to</text>
  <text start="415.909" dur="8.01">bring manufacturing back to the United</text>
  <text start="418.46" dur="9.329">States to redo the trade deals and</text>
  <text start="423.919" dur="6.03">to put everything in place for this</text>
  <text start="427.789" dur="5.34">major transition we see what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="429.949" dur="7.351">in Venezuela Styria he&amp;#39;s dismantling the</text>

  <text start="439.819" dur="6.331">has completely failed why has it failed</text>
  <text start="442.669" dur="6.391">because they thought that there was</text>
  <text start="446.15" dur="6.12">going to be someone else in the Office</text>
  <text start="449.06" dur="5.939">of the President and they thought they</text>
  <text start="452.27" dur="7.5">were going to use some type of an event</text>
  <text start="454.999" dur="8.94">to cover up this depression recession</text>
  <text start="459.77" dur="8.25">this collapse of the economy what has</text>
  <text start="463.939" dur="6.181">happened right now is that Trump he is</text>
  <text start="468.02" dur="4.94">not pushing for war he&amp;#39;s actually doing</text>
  <text start="470.12" dur="5.579">the opposite he&amp;#39;s pushing for peace and</text>
  <text start="472.96" dur="5.489">what we see happening right now is the</text>
  <text start="475.699" dur="6.12">central banks that created this illusion</text>
  <text start="478.449" dur="6.97">they don&amp;#39;t know what to do they are</text>

  <text start="514.25" dur="5.159">have an event to cover up their system</text>
  <text start="517.279" dur="4.351">imploding think about what Trump has</text>
  <text start="519.409" dur="6.24">done here and not just Trump the</text>
  <text start="521.63" dur="5.519">Patriots in the beginning Trump came out</text>
  <text start="525.649" dur="3.171">and he started to point the finger at</text>
  <text start="527.149" dur="3.601">the Fed every time they raised the rates</text>
  <text start="528.82" dur="3.009">Trump said look what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>

  <text start="541.69" dur="5.86">something happened the economy came down</text>
  <text start="544.22" dur="6.27">so now they put one and one together and</text>
  <text start="547.55" dur="5.969">they noticed why Trump pointing this out</text>

  <text start="568.829" dur="6.601">was going to unwind and they were gonna</text>
  <text start="572.19" dur="4.41">do this all together think about why</text>
  <text start="575.43" dur="4.08">they were going to do all this together</text>
  <text start="576.6" dur="6">remember their plan was to bring down</text>

  <text start="746.61" dur="8.19">point their system starts to implode</text>
  <text start="750.649" dur="6.461">Trump then will point the finger at the</text>
  <text start="754.8" dur="4.92">Fed now do I think it&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="757.11" dur="5.13">this year next year no I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="759.72" dur="6.63">going to happen once he&amp;#39;s back in office</text>
  <text start="762.24" dur="7.079">after he wins the election in 2020 once</text>
  <text start="766.35" dur="5.429">that happens Trump then is free to do</text>
  <text start="769.319" dur="5.76">whatever he wants at that point I think</text>
  <text start="771.779" dur="5.821">in the beginning of his term we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="775.079" dur="5.7">to see everything accelerate like we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="777.6" dur="5.789">never seen before the pointing of the</text>
  <text start="780.779" dur="5.641">finger at the Fed the deterioration of</text>
  <text start="783.389" dur="7.05">the economy everything falling apart it</text>
  <text start="786.42" dur="7.62">will then all be blamed on the Fed Trump</text>
  <text start="790.439" dur="6.031">will control the narrative Trump will</text>
  <text start="794.04" dur="4.2">point the finger at the Fed then point</text>
  <text start="796.47" dur="5.76">the finger at other central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="798.24" dur="6.959">letting the world know that his economy</text>
  <text start="802.23" dur="4.469">is fantastic it&amp;#39;s what the Fed is doing</text>
  <text start="805.199" dur="5.76">do you think the Fed is gonna raise</text>
  <text start="806.699" dur="6.841">rates at that point most likely yes why</text>
  <text start="810.959" dur="5.281">because Trump at that point wants the</text>
  <text start="813.54" dur="5.399">Fed to bring down the economy at that</text>
  <text start="816.24" dur="5.42">point Trump and the Patriots will have</text>
  <text start="818.939" dur="4.821">everything in place the trade deals</text>
  <text start="821.66" dur="4.71">Manufacturing being brought back to the</text>
  <text start="823.76" dur="5.91">United States they&amp;#39;ll have the new</text>
  <text start="826.37" dur="7.38">currency ironed out everything will be</text>
  <text start="829.67" dur="9.33">put into place Gold then will be used to</text>
  <text start="833.75" dur="10.44">bring the Fed down and replace this debt</text>
  <text start="839" dur="7.35">note with sound money now will this be</text>
  <text start="844.19" dur="5.28">an easy thing no it will probably be a</text>
  <text start="846.35" dur="6.42">very bumpy ride how long will it last we</text>
  <text start="849.47" dur="7.14">don&amp;#39;t know this is why everyone needs to</text>
  <text start="852.77" dur="7.11">be prepared and ready for when this</text>
  <text start="856.61" dur="5.52">comes now we have time if Trump was in</text>
  <text start="859.88" dur="3.6">an office you wouldn&amp;#39;t have any time</text>
  <text start="862.13" dur="2.51">actually it probably would have happened</text>
  <text start="863.48" dur="5.7">already</text>
  <text start="864.64" dur="8.62">Trump has given us time this means you</text>
  <text start="869.18" dur="7.23">have some time to prepare and what I</text>
  <text start="873.26" dur="5.93">mean by preparing is have food supplies</text>
  <text start="876.41" dur="6.12">have water have gold and silver to</text>
  <text start="879.19" dur="6.52">ensure your wealth have some crypto</text>
  <text start="882.53" dur="5.88">currencies make sure that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="885.71" dur="5.28">prepared for any situation you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="888.41" dur="3.9">want to be stuck when everything starts</text>
  <text start="890.99" dur="4.41">to fall apart because then it&amp;#39;s too late</text>
  <text start="892.31" dur="6.6">and this is about being prepared</text>
  <text start="895.4" dur="6.15">not for a Mad Max type of scenario it</text>
  <text start="898.91" dur="4.95">might get a little bumpy in certain</text>
  <text start="901.55" dur="5.25">areas especially the inner city where</text>
  <text start="903.86" dur="5.37">people haven&amp;#39;t prepared so you might see</text>
  <text start="906.8" dur="4.47">you know small riots you might see</text>
  <text start="909.23" dur="4.5">things like that but the country and a</text>
  <text start="911.27" dur="4.53">whole will weather the storm and I</text>
  <text start="913.73" dur="4.77">believe the Patriots they&amp;#39;re gonna make</text>
  <text start="915.8" dur="3.84">this time span as short as possible and</text>
  <text start="918.5" dur="4.44">I&amp;#39;m gonna try to get everything up and</text>
  <text start="919.64" dur="6.3">running very quickly and I believe</text>
  <text start="922.94" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;ll be able to do this because once</text>
  <text start="925.94" dur="2.7">you get rid of the central banking you</text>
  <text start="927.26" dur="4.29">get rid of all this debt and you get rid</text>
  <text start="928.64" dur="5.37">of this fake currency and you bring in</text>
  <text start="931.55" dur="6.24">sound money everything all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="934.01" dur="5.76">just revalue x&amp;#39; and all of a sudden you</text>
  <text start="937.79" dur="4.11">have something that&amp;#39;s much much better</text>
  <text start="939.77" dur="4.5">and if you look at other economies that</text>
  <text start="941.9" dur="4.11">have done this you can see they got back</text>
  <text start="944.27" dur="3.48">on their feet quite quickly now do I</text>
  <text start="946.01" dur="3.18">think it&amp;#39;s gonna happen a week in an in</text>
  <text start="947.75" dur="3">a week no I think it&amp;#39;s gonna take a</text>
  <text start="949.19" dur="3.48">little bit longer than that and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="950.75" dur="4.59">why you need to be ready and prepared</text>
  <text start="952.67" dur="6.72">for that time period and</text>
  <text start="955.34" dur="6.93">I believe that we have the time now we</text>
  <text start="959.39" dur="4.44">have the time to prepare for this</text>
  <text start="962.27" dur="3.66">transition and that&amp;#39;s what everyone</text>
  <text start="963.83" dur="4.59">should be focused on right now yes</text>
  <text start="965.93" dur="4.44">there&amp;#39;s going to be arrests yes a lot of</text>
  <text start="968.42" dur="5">things are going to change but we also</text>
  <text start="970.37" dur="5.31">need to protect our families ourselves</text>
  <text start="973.42" dur="4.81">because we&amp;#39;re going to be coming from</text>
  <text start="975.68" dur="4.98">one system to another thing would think</text>
  <text start="978.23" dur="3.18">about the 70s we were coming from the</text>
  <text start="980.66" dur="3.41">gold standard</text>
  <text start="981.41" dur="5.61">moving on to the petrodollar system and</text>
  <text start="984.07" dur="5.2">the Fed was creating currency like crazy</text>
  <text start="987.02" dur="4.65">we had gas lines we had people that were</text>
  <text start="989.27" dur="5.1">unemployed the interest rates were very</text>
  <text start="991.67" dur="6.24">high now we&amp;#39;re coming from a huge amount</text>
  <text start="994.37" dur="5.79">of debt paper fake currency and moving</text>
  <text start="997.91" dur="5.28">to sound money so we&amp;#39;re moving in the</text>
  <text start="1000.16" dur="4.44">opposite direction so it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="1003.19" dur="3.63">little bit bumpy because we&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="1004.6" dur="5.55">off a system where pretty much your</text>
  <text start="1006.82" dur="5.67">paper note is going to be devalued quite</text>
  <text start="1010.15" dur="4.98">a bit but those people that are holding</text>
  <text start="1012.49" dur="5.3">gold and silver and that type of stuff</text>
  <text start="1015.13" dur="5.52">that will be revalued but very very high</text>
  <text start="1017.79" dur="6.19">compared to the debt note that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1020.65" dur="5.52">holding so the whole point of this is to</text>
  <text start="1023.98" dur="2.82">be prepared and ready for when this</text>
  <text start="1026.17" dur="2.46">comes</text>
