  <text start="73.1" dur="5.43">collapse financial news now we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="75.35" dur="6.06">a lot of economic surveys that are being</text>
  <text start="78.53" dur="5.13">produced and they&amp;#39;re all showing the</text>
  <text start="81.41" dur="5.31">same exact thing even the conference</text>
  <text start="83.66" dur="4.44">board survey where they receive grants</text>
  <text start="86.72" dur="4.47">from the government and usually during</text>
  <text start="88.1" dur="5.49">the Obama term when he was president</text>
  <text start="91.19" dur="5.1">that survey was showing that the economy</text>
  <text start="93.59" dur="4.62">was great now it&amp;#39;s turned down and when</text>
  <text start="96.29" dur="4.23">we look at the people&amp;#39;s survey which is</text>
  <text start="98.21" dur="3.659">Gallup we can see that the economy has</text>
  <text start="100.52" dur="3.599">been turning down for quite a while</text>
  <text start="101.869" dur="4.561">people are looking at it saying you know</text>
  <text start="104.119" dur="4.021">something I really don&amp;#39;t have that much</text>
  <text start="106.43" dur="2.4">hope that the economy is going to get</text>
  <text start="108.14" dur="2.37">any better</text>
  <text start="108.83" dur="3.69">especially those individuals that have</text>
  <text start="110.51" dur="4.71">been losing their jobs and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="112.52" dur="3.72">find a high-paying job they you Mitch</text>
  <text start="115.22" dur="3.12">consumer sentiment</text>
  <text start="116.24" dur="7.5">well that dropped to ninety five point</text>
  <text start="118.34" dur="10.2">one this is the lowest in seven months</text>
  <text start="123.74" dur="8.46">going back to November 2016 and hope</text>
  <text start="128.54" dur="6.54">well that has collapsed now people are</text>
  <text start="132.2" dur="4.62">looking at the economy right now and we</text>
  <text start="135.08" dur="2.909">know there&amp;#39;s been a lot of layoffs we</text>
  <text start="136.82" dur="3.66">know there&amp;#39;s a lot of stores that are</text>
  <text start="137.989" dur="4.951">closing a lot of layoffs in corporations</text>
  <text start="140.48" dur="5.13">a lot of contract workers are being let</text>
  <text start="142.94" dur="5.61">go and we see at this point that people</text>
  <text start="145.61" dur="5.43">are saying okay I would let go go get</text>
  <text start="148.55" dur="4.59">another job but I put my resume out</text>
  <text start="151.04" dur="4.44">there and I can&amp;#39;t find one what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="153.14" dur="4.2">on and after a while people start to</text>
  <text start="155.48" dur="3.36">lose hope people realize that I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="157.34" dur="4.35">getting a raise anymore I&amp;#39;m not getting</text>
  <text start="158.84" dur="5.67">cause of inflation and the corporate</text>
  <text start="161.69" dur="4.89">media the Fed they&amp;#39;re all trying to</text>
  <text start="164.51" dur="4.59">convince us that yes the economy&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="166.58" dur="4.4">fine it&amp;#39;s still chugging along but we</text>
  <text start="169.1" dur="5.609">see things that are completely different</text>
  <text start="170.98" dur="4.21">where the economy over a long period of</text>
  <text start="174.709" dur="3.181">time</text>
  <text start="175.19" dur="5.16">slowly but surely has been deteriorating</text>
  <text start="177.89" dur="4.89">and of course they try to come up with</text>
  <text start="180.35" dur="5.039">all these different explanations it was</text>
  <text start="182.78" dur="4.25">the Sun it was the bad weather with the</text>
  <text start="185.389" dur="4.101">snow it&amp;#39;s too much ice to him</text>
  <text start="187.03" dur="3.9">wind and they kept making excuses people</text>
  <text start="189.49" dur="4.079">are shopping online people are not</text>
  <text start="190.93" dur="6.06">shopping online and this is all they did</text>
  <text start="193.569" dur="5.281">now they&amp;#39;ve run out of excuses and this</text>
  <text start="196.99" dur="3.9">is what always happens during a downturn</text>
  <text start="198.85" dur="4.44">they try to explain it away with all</text>
  <text start="200.89" dur="5.76">these ridiculous excuses and it never</text>
  <text start="203.29" dur="5.94">works now something very interesting the</text>
  <text start="206.65" dur="5.94">B EA came out with personal incomes and</text>
  <text start="209.23" dur="7.62">outlays report and it shows disposable</text>
  <text start="212.59" dur="6.69">personal income rose by seventy 1.7</text>
  <text start="216.85" dur="4.35">billion in May now when people look at</text>
  <text start="219.28" dur="4.23">this they say huh Wow look at this</text>
  <text start="221.2" dur="5.34">people have all this disposable income</text>
  <text start="223.51" dur="4.56">that people should be spending it why</text>
  <text start="226.54" dur="5.699">are they out there spending all this</text>
  <text start="228.07" dur="7.77">money now when we look at this very</text>
  <text start="232.239" dur="7.351">closely we see that well maybe it isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="235.84" dur="7.229">as much as we think and when we break it</text>
  <text start="239.59" dur="6.38">down who actually got this money now</text>
  <text start="243.069" dur="6.121">think about this for a second if</text>
  <text start="245.97" dur="8.26">consumer spending went up like they said</text>
  <text start="249.19" dur="8.37">and all of it was going to say Bill</text>
  <text start="254.23" dur="5.249">Gates and many others that money would</text>
  <text start="257.56" dur="4.19">not be in the hands of the people and</text>
  <text start="259.479" dur="4.771">they wouldn&amp;#39;t be out spending it and</text>
  <text start="261.75" dur="5.5">when we look at the wages and salaries</text>
  <text start="264.25" dur="4.8">well they were up a minuscule 6.6</text>
  <text start="267.25" dur="4.71">billion or point zero eight percent</text>
  <text start="269.05" dur="5.82">about one percent annualised and we can</text>
  <text start="271.96" dur="6.17">go a step further and ask how was the</text>
  <text start="274.87" dur="6.38">6.6 billion in wages and salaries</text>
  <text start="278.13" dur="7.39">distributed because when we look at it</text>
  <text start="281.25" dur="7.75">we could say well look at this 80% of</text>
  <text start="285.52" dur="8.1">the 6.6 billion went to the top 5% of</text>
  <text start="289" dur="7.44">the wealthy the other 20% went to the</text>
  <text start="293.62" dur="5.49">rest of the country which means the rest</text>
  <text start="296.44" dur="4.71">of the country hasn&amp;#39;t really received</text>
  <text start="299.11" dur="3.869">anything but when you look at the</text>
  <text start="301.15" dur="3.389">numbers and when you hear the corporate</text>
  <text start="302.979" dur="5.041">media sound this off it sounds</text>
  <text start="304.539" dur="5.281">absolutely fantastic and when they look</text>
  <text start="308.02" dur="3.42">at these numbers they say people should</text>
  <text start="309.82" dur="4.62">be out there spending instead their</text>
  <text start="311.44" dur="5.43">hoarding no what&amp;#39;s happening is the bulk</text>
  <text start="314.44" dur="4.17">of this is going to the wealthy the rest</text>
  <text start="316.87" dur="4">of the people they&amp;#39;re not getting</text>
  <text start="318.61" dur="5.59">anything and when you spread it over</text>
  <text start="320.87" dur="7.95">among hundreds of millions of people 20%</text>
  <text start="324.2" dur="9.12">of 6.6 billion not that much but for the</text>
  <text start="328.82" dur="6.54">5% or the 1% of the 80% of the 6.6</text>
  <text start="333.32" dur="4.8">billion they&amp;#39;re receiving quite a bit</text>
  <text start="335.36" dur="4.77">and this is how they play these numbers</text>
  <text start="338.12" dur="6.15">and this is that they manipulate what</text>
  <text start="340.13" dur="6.47">you&amp;#39;re hearing now what we are seeing we</text>
  <text start="344.27" dur="6.6">are seeing a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="346.6" dur="5.71">breakdown of the system and when we look</text>
  <text start="350.87" dur="3.36">at this we can see that Illinois they</text>
  <text start="352.31" dur="5.55">were facing a problem and we know</text>
  <text start="354.23" dur="6.81">tonight there&amp;#39;s a deadline where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="357.86" dur="4.68">going to vote on this budget and we can</text>
  <text start="361.04" dur="4.59">see already Connecticut is having this</text>
  <text start="362.54" dur="6.36">problem there are 14 other states that</text>
  <text start="365.63" dur="5.64">are also in the same boat as Illinois</text>
  <text start="368.9" dur="6.93">and Connecticut and Connecticut right</text>
  <text start="371.27" dur="9.36">now well they didn&amp;#39;t pass their budget</text>
  <text start="375.83" dur="6.87">today so the governor decided well I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="380.63" dur="4.8">going to create an executive order and</text>
  <text start="382.7" dur="5.4">he&amp;#39;s going to control and he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="385.43" dur="5.79">take over the spending after the state</text>
  <text start="388.1" dur="4.86">failed to pass their budget now what we</text>
  <text start="391.22" dur="3.33">are seeing is there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="392.96" dur="2.82">corporations that are leaving</text>
  <text start="394.55" dur="4.23">Connecticut right now</text>
  <text start="395.78" dur="5.91">Aetna the insurance giant founded in</text>
  <text start="398.78" dur="5.4">Hartford well after a hundred and sixty</text>
  <text start="401.69" dur="3.69">four years they announced that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="404.18" dur="6.3">going to be moving their headquarters to</text>
  <text start="405.38" dur="8.31">New York City we see already GE they</text>
  <text start="410.48" dur="5.55">after 40 years they are leaving the</text>
  <text start="413.69" dur="4.56">Fairfield headquarters and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="416.03" dur="4.23">moving out of the state there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="418.25" dur="4.08">hedge fund investment companies they are</text>
  <text start="420.26" dur="5.09">also leaving so we&amp;#39;re seeing this in</text>
  <text start="422.33" dur="6.12">Illinois Connecticut and 14 other states</text>
  <text start="425.35" dur="7.3">we&amp;#39;re going to have a major major</text>
  <text start="428.45" dur="7.07">problem as we move forward and we can</text>
  <text start="432.65" dur="6.32">see right now if there is any type of</text>
  <text start="435.52" dur="5.68">downturn or hiccup in the economy if</text>
  <text start="438.97" dur="3.85">they announced that we entered a</text>
  <text start="441.2" dur="4.71">recession or if the stock market comes</text>
  <text start="442.82" dur="5.73">down these states are going to collapse</text>
  <text start="445.91" dur="4.82">the pensions are going to collapse we</text>
  <text start="448.55" dur="5.48">are going to have a catastrophic event</text>
  <text start="450.73" dur="7.17">like we&amp;#39;ve never seen before</text>
  <text start="454.03" dur="6.78">now out in Europe the EU ECB they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="457.9" dur="6.33">telling us everything is fine out there</text>
  <text start="460.81" dur="6.78">the banking system is absolutely fine</text>
  <text start="464.23" dur="5.34">and we need to go back in time because</text>
  <text start="467.59" dur="6.06">there&amp;#39;s new information that&amp;#39;s out there</text>
  <text start="469.57" dur="7.56">that reveals just how serious a threat</text>
  <text start="473.65" dur="6.39">of disorderly collapse of Spain six</text>
  <text start="477.13" dur="5.76">largest bank Banco Popular might have</text>
  <text start="480.04" dur="7.41">posed to Spain&amp;#39;s banking system now in</text>
  <text start="482.89" dur="7.05">the final days of Banco Popular it was</text>
  <text start="487.45" dur="6.36">bleeding deposits at a rate of two</text>
  <text start="489.94" dur="6.39">billion euro a day on average now much</text>
  <text start="493.81" dur="5.79">of the money was being withdrawn by you</text>
  <text start="496.33" dur="4.14">guessed it institutional clients global</text>
  <text start="499.6" dur="5">megaphone</text>
  <text start="500.47" dur="6.78">Blackrock Spain Social Security Fund</text>
  <text start="504.6" dur="5.26">Spanish government agency city and</text>
  <text start="507.25" dur="5.9">regional councils now at the same time</text>
  <text start="509.86" dur="6.63">they were all withdrawing their deposits</text>
  <text start="513.15" dur="5.83">Spain&amp;#39;s economy minister was telling the</text>
  <text start="516.49" dur="4.77">bank&amp;#39;s less privileged investors</text>
  <text start="518.98" dur="4.59">including retail shareholders junior</text>
  <text start="521.26" dur="3.96">bondholders that there was absolutely</text>
  <text start="523.57" dur="5.16">nothing to worry about</text>
  <text start="525.22" dur="8.54">those that believed in what they were</text>
  <text start="528.73" dur="8.34">saying they lost everything those other</text>
  <text start="533.76" dur="7.03">institutions that were withdrawing while</text>
  <text start="537.07" dur="7.16">they got out okay and this should be a</text>
  <text start="540.79" dur="6.57">lesson to everyone when you hear these</text>
  <text start="544.23" dur="5.89">government officials the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="547.36" dur="5.43">come out and tell you don&amp;#39;t worry worry</text>
  <text start="550.12" dur="5.04">run to the bank get whatever you</text>
  <text start="552.79" dur="4.65">possibly can this is when you know</text>
  <text start="555.16" dur="4.74">things are going to go south actually</text>
  <text start="557.44" dur="4.71">should probably removing your funds now</text>
  <text start="559.9" dur="2.97">to protect yourself this is my personal</text>
  <text start="562.15" dur="2.58">opinion</text>
  <text start="562.87" dur="3.84">where we&amp;#39;re looking at examples that</text>
  <text start="564.73" dur="5.58">have been happening around the world and</text>
  <text start="566.71" dur="6.48">it doesn&amp;#39;t look too good now when we</text>
  <text start="570.31" dur="5.97">look further into this what do we see</text>
  <text start="573.19" dur="5.7">well between the end of March and its</text>
  <text start="576.28" dur="6.27">last day of trading popular shed 18</text>
  <text start="578.89" dur="5.51">billion euros of deposits roughly a</text>
  <text start="582.55" dur="4.829">quarter of the total now bear in mind</text>
  <text start="584.4" dur="7.449">that popular was a small</text>
  <text start="587.379" dur="6.57">ich Bank relatively speaking just it</text>
  <text start="591.849" dur="5.13">only had a what something like 140</text>
  <text start="593.949" dur="5.88">billion euros in assets now according to</text>
  <text start="596.979" dur="4.65">the FSB there is only one bank in Spain</text>
  <text start="599.829" dur="4.891">that is officially too big to fail and</text>
  <text start="601.629" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s Santander now Spain does have</text>
  <text start="604.72" dur="6.449">another four banks now they&amp;#39;re a little</text>
  <text start="607.059" dur="6.36">bit bigger than Banco Popular and what</text>
  <text start="611.169" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that these banks would</text>
  <text start="613.419" dur="5.07">be okay to fail they&amp;#39;re small enough so</text>
  <text start="616.149" dur="4.26">they are able to fail despite the fact</text>
  <text start="618.489" dur="4.89">that the insured deposits of those banks</text>
  <text start="620.409" dur="6">customers would also not be covered by</text>
  <text start="623.379" dur="5.91">Spain&amp;#39;s deposit guaranteed fund at least</text>
  <text start="626.409" dur="9">as it currently stands right now now in</text>
  <text start="629.289" dur="9.27">Italy we understand that the government</text>
  <text start="635.409" dur="7.34">over the weekend pulled off one of the</text>
  <text start="638.559" dur="6.86">most unbelievable bank rescues that</text>
  <text start="642.749" dur="6.67">we&amp;#39;ve seen in modern times the</text>
  <text start="645.419" dur="7.78">government committed 17 billion euros in</text>
  <text start="649.419" dur="7.86">taxpayer funds to bail out senior bond</text>
  <text start="653.199" dur="6.6">holders and depositors of the two Veneto</text>
  <text start="657.279" dur="5.28">based banks now what they did was they</text>
  <text start="659.799" dur="5.91">bend the rules they made exceptions and</text>
  <text start="662.559" dur="5.46">they allowed this to happen and they</text>
  <text start="665.709" dur="5.97">realized when we looking at this report</text>
  <text start="668.019" dur="7.201">that these banks and other banks they</text>
  <text start="671.679" dur="7.14">are really hurting right now and we can</text>
  <text start="675.22" dur="6.059">see that if more banks start to go this</text>
  <text start="678.819" dur="4.58">is going to be a complete mess and none</text>
  <text start="681.279" dur="5.071">of these banks are strong at all and</text>
  <text start="683.399" dur="4.63">something else we need to know Ely was</text>
  <text start="686.35" dur="3.469">one of the ten countries identified by</text>
  <text start="688.029" dur="5.49">the ECB in 2015</text>
  <text start="689.819" dur="5.85">unlike Spain that wasn&amp;#39;t complying with</text>
  <text start="693.519" dur="5.82">the EU rules on Deposit Guarantee</text>
  <text start="695.669" dur="5.59">schemes so Italy&amp;#39;s banks right now whose</text>
  <text start="699.339" dur="5.19">responsibility is to cover bank deposits</text>
  <text start="701.259" dur="6.36">there they&amp;#39;re in no shape at all to</text>
  <text start="704.529" dur="5.31">raise like 11 billion worth of funds</text>
  <text start="707.619" dur="5.72">they couldn&amp;#39;t even scratch together 1.2</text>
  <text start="709.839" dur="6.511">billion of funds before the weekend so</text>
  <text start="713.339" dur="5.29">when this starts to fall and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="716.35" dur="4.68">already starting to see it we see home</text>
  <text start="718.629" dur="5.281">Capital Group in Canada we</text>
  <text start="721.03" dur="5.25">the banks in Spain we see banks in Italy</text>
  <text start="723.91" dur="3.63">and from this new report we can see how</text>
  <text start="726.28" dur="3.57">bad it really is</text>
  <text start="727.54" dur="4.05">when this thing starts to fall it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="729.85" dur="5.46">going to be a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="731.59" dur="6.77">disaster now we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="735.31" dur="6.21">the Bank of International Settlements</text>
  <text start="738.36" dur="6.01">saying listen there are major risks in</text>
  <text start="741.52" dur="4.98">the global economy right now and they</text>
  <text start="744.37" dur="4.08">were talking about protectionism they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="746.5" dur="3.87">talking about carrots they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="748.45" dur="4.44">about financial cycle risk for financial</text>
  <text start="750.37" dur="6.84">stability and they made all these</text>
  <text start="752.89" dur="6.3">different points of how this entire</text>
  <text start="757.21" dur="6.27">economy can come down remember the</text>
  <text start="759.19" dur="7.14">central bank of central banks they want</text>
  <text start="763.48" dur="6.68">everything the way they want it now what</text>
  <text start="766.33" dur="6.3">Trump is doing is he&amp;#39;s unwinding</text>
  <text start="770.16" dur="5.26">everything the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="772.63" dur="5.67">bank has put together and of course when</text>
  <text start="775.42" dur="4.41">you start to do this what they do is</text>
  <text start="778.3" dur="3.51">they tell you that everything is going</text>
  <text start="779.83" dur="4.38">to fall apart I hate to say this</text>
  <text start="781.81" dur="4.77">everything was going to fall apart no</text>
  <text start="784.21" dur="6.03">matter what the reason why he is doing</text>
  <text start="786.58" dur="6.69">this with tariffs with NAFTA with the</text>
  <text start="790.24" dur="6.26">pipelines with the trade agreements with</text>
  <text start="793.27" dur="7.47">one belt one road all of this is is</text>
  <text start="796.5" dur="6.4">being done to prep us for the collapse</text>
  <text start="800.74" dur="3.81">of the economy and to restart the</text>
  <text start="802.9" dur="3.81">economy this is why he&amp;#39;s making deals</text>
  <text start="804.55" dur="6.53">with corporations to bring back</text>
  <text start="806.71" dur="7.44">manufacturing to say listen once we get</text>
  <text start="811.08" dur="6.28">everything settled you need to come back</text>
  <text start="814.15" dur="6.72">to the US you need to set up shop you</text>
  <text start="817.36" dur="6.54">need to bring back workers this has to</text>
  <text start="820.87" dur="5.46">be done because if the manufacturing</text>
  <text start="823.9" dur="5.4">doesn&amp;#39;t come back if we cannot support</text>
  <text start="826.33" dur="4.59">ourselves if we do not have trade well</text>
  <text start="829.3" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;re just going to be left out of</text>
  <text start="830.92" dur="6.84">everything because remember once this</text>
  <text start="834.19" dur="6.74">system comes down the US dollar is no</text>
  <text start="837.76" dur="6.33">longer the reserve currency of the world</text>
  <text start="840.93" dur="5.95">it will not be the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="844.09" dur="7.68">which means that all these countries</text>
  <text start="846.88" dur="7.459">receiving the dollar well they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="851.77" dur="3.979">to send it back to the United States</text>
  <text start="854.339" dur="4.711">no one&amp;#39;s going to be holding the dollar</text>
  <text start="855.749" dur="5.13">anymore the deep state will not be able</text>
  <text start="859.05" dur="4.279">to pressure these countries into doing</text>
  <text start="860.879" dur="7.591">things they want them to do everything</text>
  <text start="863.329" dur="7">will change which means that the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="868.47" dur="3.9">going to have to produce again which</text>
  <text start="870.329" dur="4.92">means we&amp;#39;re going to have to trade our</text>
  <text start="872.37" dur="5.009">produce goods with other countries which</text>
  <text start="875.249" dur="4.71">means we&amp;#39;re not going to get the oil</text>
  <text start="877.379" dur="5.07">that we&amp;#39;re receiving from the Middle</text>
  <text start="879.959" dur="3.661">Eastern countries which means we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="882.449" dur="2.49">going to have to get the oil someplace</text>
  <text start="883.62" dur="4.199">else we&amp;#39;re going to actually have to</text>
  <text start="884.939" dur="4.531">export oil we&amp;#39;re going to start to do</text>
  <text start="887.819" dur="4.531">the things that other countries have</text>
  <text start="889.47" dur="5.46">been doing for quite a while and this is</text>
  <text start="892.35" dur="4.469">what Trump is preparing for and of</text>
  <text start="894.93" dur="4.11">course coming out of the corporate media</text>
  <text start="896.819" dur="5.341">it makes us seem like it&amp;#39;s the worst</text>
  <text start="899.04" dur="6.149">thing ever now think about this back in</text>
  <text start="902.16" dur="5.219">the 70s when there was no internet when</text>
  <text start="905.189" dur="4.44">there really was nothing out there</text>
  <text start="907.379" dur="5.551">except for the corporate media they were</text>
  <text start="909.629" dur="6.091">spewing the lie that we had a gas</text>
  <text start="912.93" dur="6.329">shortage that&amp;#39;s why you couldn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="915.72" dur="5.88">fuel they weren&amp;#39;t telling you that we</text>
  <text start="919.259" dur="4.471">came off the gold standard that we were</text>
  <text start="921.6" dur="5.07">going on to a new standard which is the</text>
  <text start="923.73" dur="5.19">petro dollar where basically there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="926.67" dur="5.339">going to be no checks and balances on</text>
  <text start="928.92" dur="6.87">how much the government spends or how</text>
  <text start="932.009" dur="7.111">much the Federal Reserve creates so they</text>
  <text start="935.79" dur="6.63">made up an entire story that we had a</text>
  <text start="939.12" dur="5.37">gas shortage that everyone has to chip</text>
  <text start="942.42" dur="4.95">in and everyone has to conserve and</text>
  <text start="944.49" dur="5.579">everyone has to do their part this is</text>
  <text start="947.37" dur="3.99">what they do when we&amp;#39;re moving to a new</text>
  <text start="950.069" dur="3.96">system especially when they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="951.36" dur="6">control they make it seem like it&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="954.029" dur="6.3">fault you have to do this you have to</text>
  <text start="957.36" dur="4.829">sacrifice and they&amp;#39;re doing the same</text>
  <text start="960.329" dur="5.25">thing right now but in a different way</text>
  <text start="962.189" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;re showing everything that Trump is</text>
  <text start="965.579" dur="5.161">doing that this is going to be bad for</text>
  <text start="968.459" dur="3.99">the economy just like during the brexit</text>
  <text start="970.74" dur="3.81">well if the people vote for the</text>
  <text start="972.449" dur="4.74">referendum the entire economy is going</text>
  <text start="974.55" dur="4.079">to crash the next day the whole entire</text>
  <text start="977.189" dur="4.26">system is just going to come down it</text>
  <text start="978.629" dur="6.871">didn&amp;#39;t happen what they&amp;#39;re really saying</text>

  <text start="1006.46" dur="5.2">many people think he&amp;#39;s part of the</text>
  <text start="1008.54" dur="9.42">Republican Party he&amp;#39;s not Republicans</text>
  <text start="1011.66" dur="8.55">hate him he had to make concessions he</text>
  <text start="1017.96" dur="5.07">needed to bring certain people in there</text>

  <text start="1023.03" dur="6.27">me on board and then he fired him he had</text>
  <text start="1027.38" dur="4.579">to do this eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1029.3" dur="7.26">happen is one person after another</text>

  <text start="1049.52" dur="3.87">yes it would be great if we could just</text>
  <text start="1051.38" dur="4.62">throw a switch and everything can be</text>
  <text start="1053.39" dur="5.52">changed the next day but in reality in</text>
  <text start="1056" dur="5.82">the real world it doesn&amp;#39;t work that way</text>
  <text start="1058.91" dur="6.45">you still are fighting against other</text>
