  <text start="30.58" dur="5.13">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="34.39" dur="4.05">rapport my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="35.71" dur="5.76">episode 1088 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="38.44" dur="5.16">September 29th 2016 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="41.47" dur="5.089">episode it is the economy is a house of</text>
  <text start="43.6" dur="5.43">cards and it will come crashing down</text>
  <text start="46.559" dur="5.261">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="49.03" dur="4.919">financial news well today on the market</text>
  <text start="51.82" dur="4.949">it doesn&amp;#39;t look like things are going</text>
  <text start="53.949" dur="5.07">well the market is way down and we see</text>
  <text start="56.769" dur="8.731">there are many things occurring at once</text>
  <text start="59.019" dur="9.871">and the system this house of cards it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="65.5" dur="7.11">about ready to come down and we see the</text>
  <text start="68.89" dur="5.37">central bankers or scrambling because we</text>
  <text start="72.61" dur="3.18">need to remember they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="74.26" dur="4.5">this system together with their</text>
  <text start="75.79" dur="5.7">illusionary manipulated numbers long</text>
  <text start="78.76" dur="4.89">enough to have a narrative to have a</text>
  <text start="81.49" dur="4.44">story of why the economy is coming</text>
  <text start="83.65" dur="4.35">crashing down they don&amp;#39;t want something</text>
  <text start="85.93" dur="4.619">coming out of left field because if that</text>
  <text start="88" dur="4.2">occurs they know that people are going</text>
  <text start="90.549" dur="4.641">to blame them and they don&amp;#39;t want that</text>
  <text start="92.2" dur="5.42">to happen and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="95.19" dur="5.86">they&amp;#39;re keeping this illusion alive</text>
  <text start="97.62" dur="6.78">initial jobless claims well they have</text>
  <text start="101.05" dur="6.57">remained stuck at for decade lows and</text>
  <text start="104.4" dur="6.15">the question is where are all the jobs</text>
  <text start="107.62" dur="5.76">because if no one&amp;#39;s making any claims</text>
  <text start="110.55" dur="3.67">you&amp;#39;re trying to convince me that people</text>
  <text start="113.38" dur="2.28">are just saying you know that they</text>
  <text start="114.22" dur="3.27">already know that unemployment I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="115.66" dur="5.07">gonna ride this baby out and I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="117.49" dur="4.41">gonna sit here and not even work because</text>
  <text start="120.73" dur="3.24">we know the jobs aren&amp;#39;t met in</text>
  <text start="121.9" dur="2.91">manufacturing we know the jobs aren&amp;#39;t in</text>
  <text start="123.97" dur="2.49">the service sector</text>
  <text start="124.81" dur="5.28">we know that people aren&amp;#39;t buying</text>
  <text start="126.46" dur="8.669">durable goods and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="130.09" dur="6.03">that people are shying away from going</text>
  <text start="135.129" dur="2.61">out to dinner at the restaurant</text>
  <text start="136.12" dur="5.399">restaurant performance index is</text>
  <text start="137.739" dur="6.901">continually dropping and we see that</text>
  <text start="141.519" dur="4.86">retail is contracting so from what we</text>
  <text start="144.64" dur="6.23">look at from what we&amp;#39;re looking at right</text>
  <text start="146.379" dur="8.431">now we are seeing these different</text>
  <text start="150.87" dur="6.369">economic sectors contract and if these</text>
  <text start="154.81" dur="5.91">are contracting this tells us that</text>
  <text start="157.239" dur="6.601">people don&amp;#39;t have jobs and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="160.72" dur="3.81">hard to convince myself and most likely</text>
  <text start="163.84" dur="2.85">you and</text>
  <text start="164.53" dur="4.44">everyone else that these individuals who</text>
  <text start="166.69" dur="5.61">are being laid off they&amp;#39;re not going out</text>
  <text start="168.97" dur="6.44">and claiming I&amp;#39;m an unemployment it</text>
  <text start="172.3" dur="6.09">makes no sense and we know a lot of this</text>
  <text start="175.41" dur="6.159">these jobs that are being lost are in</text>
  <text start="178.39" dur="4.79">retail and you have to remember how the</text>
  <text start="181.569" dur="5.281">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="183.18" dur="6.55">how they count the jobs in retail if</text>
  <text start="186.85" dur="4.92">you&amp;#39;re working in retail and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="189.73" dur="3.66">working a certain number of hours and it</text>
  <text start="191.77" dur="4.01">varies from state to state and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="193.39" dur="7.62">getting paid a certain dollar amounts</text>
  <text start="195.78" dur="8.5">well you&amp;#39;re considered full-time but</text>
  <text start="201.01" dur="6.33">when you lose that job they don&amp;#39;t count</text>
  <text start="204.28" dur="5.85">it as a job loss they count it as you</text>
  <text start="207.34" dur="5.94">were working part time this is how they</text>
  <text start="210.13" dur="5.609">kind of massage manipulate the numbers</text>
  <text start="213.28" dur="4.23">so these individuals who are getting</text>
  <text start="215.739" dur="4.261">laid off if they&amp;#39;re working under a</text>
  <text start="217.51" dur="3.75">certain number of hours the reason why</text>
  <text start="220" dur="2.64">they&amp;#39;re counting in the most part time</text>
  <text start="221.26" dur="3.809">is because they don&amp;#39;t meet the</text>
  <text start="222.64" dur="6.48">qualifications to apply for unemployment</text>
  <text start="225.069" dur="6.48">but they still lost their jobs so this</text>
  <text start="229.12" dur="4.47">is very misleading because on one hand</text>
  <text start="231.549" dur="5.551">they&amp;#39;re counting these individuals as</text>
  <text start="233.59" dur="4.92">having a full time job and when they get</text>
  <text start="237.1" dur="3">laid off if they don&amp;#39;t meet certain</text>
  <text start="238.51" dur="5.789">requirements they can&amp;#39;t apply for</text>
  <text start="240.1" dur="8.28">unemployment and they created this</text>
  <text start="244.299" dur="6.361">entire system like this to fool the</text>
  <text start="248.38" dur="4.07">everyday person that look we have no</text>
  <text start="250.66" dur="6.03">claims whatsoever</text>
  <text start="252.45" dur="8.349">now coincidentally we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="256.69" dur="10.229">a pattern and if we go back to 2012 we</text>
  <text start="260.799" dur="10.981">can see that the claims magically drop</text>
  <text start="266.919" dur="9.151">off during the lead-up to the elections</text>
  <text start="271.78" dur="8.4">I mean it&amp;#39;s a sharp drop here we are in</text>
  <text start="276.07" dur="7.349">2016 we&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing occur</text>
  <text start="280.18" dur="5.19">and it looks like this is a pattern</text>
  <text start="283.419" dur="3.841">because what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is</text>
  <text start="285.37" dur="5.13">make it look like the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="287.26" dur="7.26">very well so they put the manipulation</text>
  <text start="290.5" dur="5.94">into overdrive we&amp;#39;re seeing the Baltic</text>
  <text start="294.52" dur="2.86">Dry Index it hit a high of nine hundred</text>
  <text start="296.44" dur="3.4">and</text>
  <text start="297.38" dur="7.2">change and now it&amp;#39;s dropping back down</text>
  <text start="299.84" dur="8.94">we have to remember Hanjin that cargo</text>
  <text start="304.58" dur="7.5">ship system went bankrupt it was out of</text>
  <text start="308.78" dur="6.99">South Korea and they weren&amp;#39;t delivering</text>
  <text start="312.08" dur="6.09">cargo and this might have affected the</text>
  <text start="315.77" dur="3.54">bolt of dry index and we can start we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="318.17" dur="3.87">starting to see that the Baltic Dry</text>
  <text start="319.31" dur="7.08">Index is now dropping every day moving</text>
  <text start="322.04" dur="8.28">back to its lows we see the second</text>
  <text start="326.39" dur="6.9">quarter GDP well they finally finalized</text>
  <text start="330.32" dur="4.11">the number and it&amp;#39;s incredible it&amp;#39;s 1.4</text>
  <text start="333.29" dur="6.42">percent and you have to remember what</text>
  <text start="334.43" dur="7.5">makes up GDP spending the consumer that</text>
  <text start="339.71" dur="4.79">goes out and spends money that makes up</text>
  <text start="341.93" dur="6.3">about 70% of it but you have to remember</text>
  <text start="344.5" dur="7.5">health insurance is included in that if</text>
  <text start="348.23" dur="8.69">we strip away health insurance GDP is</text>
  <text start="352" dur="7.9">nowhere near 1.4 percent it&amp;#39;s near zero</text>
  <text start="356.92" dur="6.46">because the health insurance premiums</text>
  <text start="359.9" dur="6.57">continually rise and when they talk</text>
  <text start="363.38" dur="3.93">about increased spending that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="366.47" dur="2.49">they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="367.31" dur="4.23">the people aren&amp;#39;t getting anything from</text>
  <text start="368.96" dur="6.99">it the economy is not getting anything</text>
  <text start="371.54" dur="6.48">from it so what we&amp;#39;re looking at is</text>
  <text start="375.95" dur="4.59">these manipulated numbers that 1.4</text>
  <text start="378.02" dur="6.81">percent that is absolutely awful and</text>
  <text start="380.54" dur="6.03">that&amp;#39;s a manipulated number we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="384.83" dur="3.9">over the last four quarters corporate</text>
  <text start="386.57" dur="5.79">profits they have decreased by four</text>
  <text start="388.73" dur="6.39">point three percent so if we put the US</text>
  <text start="392.36" dur="4.94">economy data in context over the 12</text>
  <text start="395.12" dur="5.04">months real GDP continues to drop</text>
  <text start="397.3" dur="4.93">sliding one point to eight percent even</text>
  <text start="400.16" dur="4.38">with the modest upward revision and that</text>
  <text start="402.23" dur="5.85">has been below two percent in the last</text>
  <text start="404.54" dur="7.47">three quarters it&amp;#39;s a very strange</text>
  <text start="408.08" dur="5.79">recovery because it&amp;#39;s manipulated that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="412.01" dur="6.02">why people can&amp;#39;t get a handle on this</text>
  <text start="413.87" dur="7.59">that&amp;#39;s why it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense we see</text>
  <text start="418.03" dur="5.35">pending home sales well they have</text>
  <text start="421.46" dur="4.29">dropped by two point four percent so</text>
  <text start="423.38" dur="5.43">we&amp;#39;ve seen new construction drop</text>
  <text start="425.75" dur="5.83">existing homes drop pending home sales</text>
  <text start="428.81" dur="5.65">drop so the summer bounces</text>
  <text start="431.58" dur="6.27">it&amp;#39;s over and the National Association</text>
  <text start="434.46" dur="5.94">of Realtors Lawrence young well he has a</text>
  <text start="437.85" dur="6.69">warning for everyone there is evidence</text>
  <text start="440.4" dur="6.57">that is piling up that without more new</text>
  <text start="444.54" dur="6.9">home construction the current housing</text>
  <text start="446.97" dur="5.85">recovery could stall well it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="451.44" dur="3.87">matter how much new construction you</text>
  <text start="452.82" dur="4.849">have the housing market is stalling</text>
  <text start="455.31" dur="4.47">because if you have new construction</text>
  <text start="457.669" dur="2.5">individuals need to sell their existing</text>
  <text start="459.78" dur="3.6">homes</text>
  <text start="460.169" dur="5.521">if existing homes are declining there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="463.38" dur="4.5">no one going out and purchasing these</text>
  <text start="465.69" dur="4.95">new homes so this is not going to work</text>
  <text start="467.88" dur="4.74">and if everyone&amp;#39;s thinking well maybe</text>
  <text start="470.64" dur="3.45">it&amp;#39;s the younger generation that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="472.62" dur="3.72">to come out and purchase these brand-new</text>
  <text start="474.09" dur="5.1">homes not when they&amp;#39;re piled up with</text>
  <text start="476.34" dur="4.32">student loan debt not when they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="479.19" dur="3.06">find a job they&amp;#39;re living home with</text>
  <text start="480.66" dur="3.06">their parents and they have a part-time</text>
  <text start="482.25" dur="4.229">job or no job at all</text>
  <text start="483.72" dur="7.08">it&amp;#39;s not going to happen the real estate</text>
  <text start="486.479" dur="9.871">market is coming down prices are</text>
  <text start="490.8" dur="8.64">dropping sales are declining and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="496.35" dur="7.08">getting worse in each and every area</text>
  <text start="499.44" dur="7.229">it&amp;#39;s not improving whatsoever Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="503.43" dur="7.56">first economic chief says one third of</text>
  <text start="506.669" dur="6.81">men they&amp;#39;re going to be jobless and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="510.99" dur="5.28">going to get worse as we approach 2050</text>
  <text start="513.479" dur="5.821">one well I&amp;#39;m gonna say there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="516.27" dur="4.709">be more men unemployed because right now</text>
  <text start="519.3" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s about seven</text>
  <text start="520.979" dur="6.301">million men aged 25 to 54 that are out</text>
  <text start="525.36" dur="4.5">of the workforce well you have to</text>
  <text start="527.28" dur="4.83">remember we have about a hundred million</text>
  <text start="529.86" dur="6.24">or so people that have fallen off the</text>
  <text start="532.11" dur="7.79">workforce so this number is a little off</text>
  <text start="536.1" dur="6.18">here and if you are thinking like why</text>
  <text start="539.9" dur="5.8">can&amp;#39;t these people find work it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="542.28" dur="5.67">because the jobs don&amp;#39;t exist those</text>
  <text start="545.7" dur="5.63">individuals that are coming from these</text>
  <text start="547.95" dur="6">high-paying jobs they can&amp;#39;t find work</text>
  <text start="551.33" dur="6.07">they can it&amp;#39;s hard to find part-time</text>
  <text start="553.95" dur="6.42">work because we see the college</text>
  <text start="557.4" dur="5.18">graduates they&amp;#39;re having a tough time</text>
  <text start="560.37" dur="6.02">getting part-time work</text>
  <text start="562.58" dur="7.41">and this is why it&amp;#39;s the ages of 25 to</text>
  <text start="566.39" dur="5.629">54 and this is going to get worse as</text>
  <text start="569.99" dur="5.01">time goes on because we are losing our</text>
  <text start="572.019" dur="4.181">manufacturing jobs we&amp;#39;re losing our</text>
  <text start="575" dur="4.43">high-paying jobs</text>
  <text start="576.2" dur="8.069">and it&amp;#39;s all being replaced with service</text>
  <text start="579.43" dur="7.149">part-time jobs and eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="584.269" dur="5.901">going to happen as the US falls into a</text>
  <text start="586.579" dur="5.341">third-world type of country scenario</text>
  <text start="590.17" dur="4.5">individuals are going to find it very</text>
  <text start="591.92" dur="5.909">difficult to find any type of job and</text>
  <text start="594.67" dur="4.78">the jobs they do find the pay is going</text>
  <text start="597.829" dur="4.231">to be very very low this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="599.45" dur="4.29">bringing in a lot of illegals refugees</text>
  <text start="602.06" dur="4.08">because they understand these</text>
  <text start="603.74" dur="5.64">individuals they will have no problem</text>
  <text start="606.14" dur="6.3">working for low wages and they</text>
  <text start="609.38" dur="7.92">understand that eventually the US will</text>
  <text start="612.44" dur="7.589">fall into a third world nation we see</text>
  <text start="617.3" dur="5.88">Deutsche Bank this could be the catalyst</text>
  <text start="620.029" dur="6.12">of bringing down the entire system we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="623.18" dur="5.7">seeing hedge funds investors well</text>
  <text start="626.149" dur="5.221">they&amp;#39;re withdrawing excess cash from</text>
  <text start="628.88" dur="5.16">deutsche bank and from internal bank</text>
  <text start="631.37" dur="4.82">documents we&amp;#39;re seeing investment</text>
  <text start="634.04" dur="4.77">companies like millennium Partners</text>
  <text start="636.19" dur="6.19">capulet investment management locos</text>
  <text start="638.81" dur="6.33">capital management and about 10 other</text>
  <text start="642.38" dur="6.449">hedge funds they have cut their exposure</text>
  <text start="645.14" dur="7.199">to Deutsche Bank people are very nervous</text>
  <text start="648.829" dur="5.491">as what is happening right now we see</text>
  <text start="652.339" dur="4.771">OPEC has agreed on the first oil</text>
  <text start="654.32" dur="4.29">production cut since 2008 and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="657.11" dur="4.2">going to finalize this in November now</text>
  <text start="658.61" dur="4.74">there are certain sticking points all of</text>
  <text start="661.31" dur="5.94">this we understand that Iran wants to</text>
  <text start="663.35" dur="6.33">continually pump oil we see that Iraq is</text>
  <text start="667.25" dur="6.57">saying that we cannot we cannot accept</text>
  <text start="669.68" dur="7.14">the OPEC deal and this might completely</text>
  <text start="673.82" dur="5.55">fall apart by November and we see right</text>
  <text start="676.82" dur="5.04">now that they&amp;#39;re continually pumping</text>
  <text start="679.37" dur="6.659">this oil there&amp;#39;s a glut on the market</text>
  <text start="681.86" dur="7.62">and Saudi Arabia is collapsing and now</text>
  <text start="686.029" dur="5.971">with this new 911 bill that is out there</text>
  <text start="689.48" dur="4.68">we need to see what Saudi Arabia is</text>
  <text start="692" dur="4.27">going to do and this is something that</text>
  <text start="694.16" dur="5.08">we&amp;#39;re watching right now</text>
  <text start="696.27" dur="5.7">but something major is coming in the</text>
  <text start="699.24" dur="7.08">markets we can see it it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="701.97" dur="6.3">flashing red signals right at us we&amp;#39;re</text>
