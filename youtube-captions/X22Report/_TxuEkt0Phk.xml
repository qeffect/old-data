  <text start="56.6" dur="5.099">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="57.98" dur="6.69">episode 1687 a.n today&amp;#39;s date is October</text>
  <text start="61.699" dur="6.511">11th 2018 and the thought of the episode</text>
  <text start="64.67" dur="7.199">is rates raised market drops whose in</text>
  <text start="68.21" dur="6.09">the kill box coincidence let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="71.869" dur="4.711">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="74.3" dur="5.13">we are starting to see the plan take</text>
  <text start="76.58" dur="4.289">shape and when I say the plan I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="79.43" dur="3.24">just talking about going after the deep</text>
  <text start="80.869" dur="3.811">state I&amp;#39;m talking about the entire plan</text>
  <text start="82.67" dur="3.3">and the other side of the plane is</text>
  <text start="84.68" dur="2.609">getting rid of the central bank and</text>
  <text start="85.97" dur="2.34">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about this for quite</text>
  <text start="87.289" dur="3.211">a while</text>
  <text start="88.31" dur="3.78">queue really doesn&amp;#39;t mention the Federal</text>
  <text start="90.5" dur="5.159">Reserve or the central banking system</text>
  <text start="92.09" dur="6.479">and pretty much stays quiet about it but</text>
  <text start="95.659" dur="7.561">this is part of the plan and we can see</text>
  <text start="98.569" dur="7.05">what Trump is doing right now now we</text>
  <text start="103.22" dur="4.89">know that US Treasury secretary Steve</text>
  <text start="105.619" dur="4.051">minuchin he&amp;#39;s out there warning China</text>
  <text start="108.11" dur="3.89">not to engage in a competitive</text>
  <text start="109.67" dur="5.27">devaluation of its currency and</text>
  <text start="112" dur="6.31">Christine Lagarde who is the</text>
  <text start="114.94" dur="5.679">International Monetary Fund chief came</text>
  <text start="118.31" dur="4.11">out and dismissed the idea that China is</text>
  <text start="120.619" dur="5.971">manipulating its currency to gain a</text>
  <text start="122.42" dur="7.8">competitive advantage giving a giving</text>
  <text start="126.59" dur="5.76">verbal support to Beijing as the US</text>
  <text start="130.22" dur="4.35">continually says no China is doing this</text>
  <text start="132.35" dur="3.75">and of course Christine Lagarde is out</text>
  <text start="134.57" dur="3.06">there saying well the reason why it</text>
  <text start="136.1" dur="5.34">looks like this is because the dollar is</text>
  <text start="137.63" dur="6.99">very strong and we see that this is</text>
  <text start="141.44" dur="4.95">really all part of the plan now Trump</text>
  <text start="144.62" dur="4.17">was out there saying that yes China is</text>
  <text start="146.39" dur="4.29">manipulating their currency but we see</text>
  <text start="148.79" dur="4.86">something very interesting happening if</text>
  <text start="150.68" dur="6.33">we start to put all of this together we</text>
  <text start="153.65" dur="6.39">can start to see the picture of what</text>
  <text start="157.01" dur="5.729">Trump and the Patriots are trying to do</text>
  <text start="160.04" dur="5.699">here I mean let&amp;#39;s start from the</text>
  <text start="162.739" dur="5.671">beginning here in the beginning Trump</text>
  <text start="165.739" dur="4.681">came into office and he was going to</text>
  <text start="168.41" dur="5.76">drain the swamp get rid of the deep</text>
  <text start="170.42" dur="6.81">state put the rule of law back and help</text>
  <text start="174.17" dur="5.55">the economy and as we can see throughout</text>
  <text start="177.23" dur="7.229">time he&amp;#39;s removed a lot of the</text>
  <text start="179.72" dur="7.08">globalists trade deals gave the u.s. a</text>
  <text start="184.459" dur="5.071">buffer area where</text>
  <text start="186.8" dur="5.19">he can go ahead and try to bring back</text>
  <text start="189.53" dur="5.01">manufacturing and prep the United States</text>
  <text start="191.99" dur="4.62">for this transition and this transition</text>
  <text start="194.54" dur="3.45">is a transition away from the central</text>
  <text start="196.61" dur="5.31">banking system that&amp;#39;s really what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="197.99" dur="7.14">all about and he started to contradict</text>
  <text start="201.92" dur="8.49">the Fed now of course he placed Powell</text>
  <text start="205.13" dur="9.78">into the Fed head position so we have</text>
  <text start="210.41" dur="6.99">Powell in there Yellen is out and he did</text>
  <text start="214.91" dur="5.55">the same thing with Jeff Sessions he put</text>
  <text start="217.4" dur="5.28">jeff sessions into the position and we</text>
  <text start="220.46" dur="5.16">can see that he&amp;#39;s using pretty much the</text>
  <text start="222.68" dur="5.04">same strategy where with jeff sessions</text>
  <text start="225.62" dur="4.53">as we know he continually says god I</text>
  <text start="227.72" dur="5.01">wish I had a really good Attorney</text>
  <text start="230.15" dur="5.28">General I wish he would do more I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="232.73" dur="5.55">disappointed in Jeff sessions now the</text>
  <text start="235.43" dur="5.37">reason why Trump was doing that was to</text>
  <text start="238.28" dur="5.07">get everyone to sign with Jeff Sessions</text>
  <text start="240.8" dur="5.28">so when the hammer came down and when it</text>
  <text start="243.35" dur="4.05">does come down they can&amp;#39;t go back and</text>
  <text start="246.08" dur="4.11">say well we don&amp;#39;t want Jeff sessions now</text>
  <text start="247.4" dur="5.339">because the entire time they did the</text>
  <text start="250.19" dur="5.49">opposite of what Trump was saying now</text>
  <text start="252.739" dur="5.551">let&amp;#39;s look at the central bank Trump</text>
  <text start="255.68" dur="5.58">right now is contradicting the central</text>
  <text start="258.29" dur="3.99">bank on rates now when he plays Powell</text>
  <text start="261.26" dur="3.48">into this position</text>
  <text start="262.28" dur="4.29">the first thing he pretty much said was</text>
  <text start="264.74" dur="4.47">I thought this was going to be an easy</text>
  <text start="266.57" dur="4.849">money fed well do you really think he</text>
  <text start="269.21" dur="5.07">placed this person in this position</text>
  <text start="271.419" dur="5.801">without knowing what Powell was going to</text>
  <text start="274.28" dur="5.13">do of course he did he knew that this</text>
  <text start="277.22" dur="4.26">wasn&amp;#39;t going to be an easy money fed he</text>
  <text start="279.41" dur="5.25">knew that this was going to be a rate</text>
  <text start="281.48" dur="5.61">fed because they had it planned they</text>
  <text start="284.66" dur="4.08">know how to bring down the system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="287.09" dur="3.81">not really a secret if you go back in</text>
  <text start="288.74" dur="4.13">time look throughout history you can see</text>
  <text start="290.9" dur="5.01">every time the Fed raises its rates</text>
  <text start="292.87" dur="5.44">everything starts to fall apart and this</text>
  <text start="295.91" dur="4.77">time since the recovery the whole thing</text>
  <text start="298.31" dur="4.74">is one gigantic illusion the interest</text>
  <text start="300.68" dur="4.739">rates were suppressed and manipulated</text>
  <text start="303.05" dur="4.2">down this isn&amp;#39;t an open and free market</text>
  <text start="305.419" dur="4.171">where interest rates find their position</text>
  <text start="307.25" dur="3.69">where the stock market finds where it</text>
  <text start="309.59" dur="4.17">should be and companies go out of</text>
  <text start="310.94" dur="6.75">business no this is one gigantic</text>
  <text start="313.76" dur="6.36">manipulation so Trump is out there and</text>
  <text start="317.69" dur="2.98">he is saying that the Fed is making a</text>
  <text start="320.12" dur="3.34">big mistake</text>
  <text start="320.67" dur="6.18">by being too aggressive he said the Fed</text>
  <text start="323.46" dur="7.4">is getting a bit too cute now this is</text>
  <text start="326.85" dur="7.53">very interesting and he he&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="330.86" dur="7.33">contradicting or blaming the Fed for</text>
  <text start="334.38" dur="6.18">what is happening so Trump decided you</text>
  <text start="338.19" dur="4.68">know something let me clarify what I was</text>
  <text start="340.56" dur="5.25">talking about and he came out and said</text>
  <text start="342.87" dur="4.89">listen I&amp;#39;m not gonna fire Powell he</text>
  <text start="345.81" dur="3.36">doesn&amp;#39;t want to fire him I mean a lot of</text>
  <text start="347.76" dur="3.51">people think because he&amp;#39;s talking like</text>
  <text start="349.17" dur="4.77">this that he&amp;#39;s going to fire Powell and</text>
  <text start="351.27" dur="4.59">Powell is going to be next this is what</text>
  <text start="353.94" dur="3.78">the mainstream media the deep state this</text>
  <text start="355.86" dur="4.47">is what they keep saying just like with</text>
  <text start="357.72" dur="4.83">Rob Rosenstein he keeps saying I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="360.33" dur="4.17">want to fire him but the mainstream</text>
  <text start="362.55" dur="3.75">media sangwoo Rob Rosen Stein&amp;#39;s next</text>
  <text start="364.5" dur="4.95">Trump will fire him they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="366.3" dur="7.41">do this with Powell now and he said I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="369.45" dur="5.64">not gonna fire him he says that the Fed</text>
  <text start="373.71" dur="4.47">is being too aggressive with these</text>
  <text start="375.09" dur="5.39">interest rate hikes he said I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="378.18" dur="4.65">angry with the Fed chief he said I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="380.48" dur="6.49">disappointed wasn&amp;#39;t he disappointed with</text>
  <text start="382.83" dur="7.95">sessions absolutely so let&amp;#39;s start to</text>
  <text start="386.97" dur="5.7">look at the strategy right now so in the</text>
  <text start="390.78" dur="6.66">last day or two we&amp;#39;ve seen the market</text>
  <text start="392.67" dur="5.69">come down now remember Trump has the</text>
  <text start="397.44" dur="4.2">magic wand</text>
  <text start="398.36" dur="5.68">he knows how everything works how</text>
  <text start="401.64" dur="4.77">everything is manipulated it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="404.04" dur="6.12">secret they know all they have it all</text>
  <text start="406.41" dur="6.18">and when the market was dropping Trump</text>
  <text start="410.16" dur="6.66">said it&amp;#39;s a correction that I think is</text>
  <text start="412.59" dur="6.15">caused by the Federal Reserve because he</text>
  <text start="416.82" dur="3.96">was asked about the markets and he</text>
  <text start="418.74" dur="5.49">blamed the correction on the Federal</text>
  <text start="420.78" dur="6.93">Reserve very interesting he said I think</text>
  <text start="424.23" dur="5.67">the Fed is far too stringent and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="427.71" dur="5.88">making a mistake and when he was talking</text>
  <text start="429.9" dur="5.88">about the dollar Trump sounded less than</text>
  <text start="433.59" dur="4.92">enthusiastic about the dollar strength</text>
  <text start="435.78" dur="5.19">so far this year saying that frankly the</text>
  <text start="438.51" dur="7.44">strong dollar doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean</text>
  <text start="440.97" dur="7.41">all good hmm that&amp;#39;s very interesting so</text>
  <text start="445.95" dur="6.32">while he was saying all this about</text>
  <text start="448.38" dur="5.88">Powell and the Fed the IMF came out and</text>
  <text start="452.27" dur="4.24">defended the Fed</text>
  <text start="454.26" dur="5.94">now in our last couple of reports the</text>
  <text start="456.51" dur="6.45">IMF wasn&amp;#39;t defending the Fed the IMF was</text>
  <text start="460.2" dur="5.19">going after the Fed saying raising these</text>
  <text start="462.96" dur="6">rates are hurting the emerging markets</text>
  <text start="465.39" dur="6">and it will disrupt the global economy</text>
  <text start="468.96" dur="5.46">now since Trump is saying he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="471.39" dur="8.36">like Powell doesn&amp;#39;t like the Fed the IMF</text>
  <text start="474.42" dur="9.54">is out there and it&amp;#39;s praising the Fed</text>
  <text start="479.75" dur="6.91">the Fed is doing a great job actually</text>
  <text start="483.96" dur="4.89">the head of the International Monetary</text>
  <text start="486.66" dur="3.75">Fund Christine Lagarde defended the</text>
  <text start="488.85" dur="3.69">Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell</text>
  <text start="490.41" dur="6.9">and she said the following I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="492.54" dur="7.29">associate J Powell with craziness he</text>
  <text start="497.31" dur="7.53">comes across and members of his board as</text>
  <text start="499.83" dur="7.38">extremely serious solid and certainly</text>
  <text start="504.84" dur="5.28">keen to base their decisions on actual</text>
  <text start="507.21" dur="6.6">information now this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="510.12" dur="7.38">now the IMF is supporting the Fed and</text>
  <text start="513.81" dur="6.93">supporting Jerome Powell that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="517.5" dur="6.479">interesting so let&amp;#39;s look at this back</text>
  <text start="520.74" dur="5.61">in July Trump started to criticize the</text>
  <text start="523.979" dur="6.091">Fed the mainstream media was all over</text>
  <text start="526.35" dur="6.56">him and then once again when the Fed</text>
  <text start="530.07" dur="5.19">raised its rates he criticized the</text>
  <text start="532.91" dur="4.57">raising of the rates saying I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="535.26" dur="4.89">think this is a good time for this we</text>
  <text start="537.48" dur="7.14">have debt coming soon then the market</text>
  <text start="540.15" dur="7.41">drops and he blames the Fed I mean is</text>
  <text start="544.62" dur="8.13">this a coincidence no this is not a</text>
  <text start="547.56" dur="8.99">coincidence this is planned so think</text>
  <text start="552.75" dur="7.5">about what he&amp;#39;s doing right now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="556.55" dur="9.13">going after Powell and the Fed mostly</text>
  <text start="560.25" dur="9.6">the Fed Powell is his agent inside doing</text>
  <text start="565.68" dur="7.47">the work that he wants now he has the</text>
  <text start="569.85" dur="5.64">mainstream media backing the Fed know</text>
  <text start="573.15" dur="4.26">the feds doing a fantastic job let them</text>
  <text start="575.49" dur="5.4">do what they need to do christine</text>
  <text start="577.41" dur="6.03">lagarde now is defending the Fed saying</text>
  <text start="580.89" dur="4.5">that he&amp;#39;s not crazy this is a good thing</text>
  <text start="583.44" dur="3.81">he&amp;#39;s raising the rates he knows what</text>
  <text start="585.39" dur="5.309">he&amp;#39;s doing he&amp;#39;s a serious guy</text>
  <text start="587.25" dur="5.43">so the IMF is back in the fed the</text>
  <text start="590.699" dur="3.93">mainstream media is back in the Fed the</text>
  <text start="592.68" dur="3.839">deep state system is backing the Fed</text>
  <text start="594.629" dur="5.031">wine because that&amp;#39;s where they get their</text>
  <text start="596.519" dur="9.81">source of funding it&amp;#39;s a corrupt system</text>
  <text start="599.66" dur="10.69">so when the system collapses the whole</text>
  <text start="606.329" dur="7.141">thing falls apart what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="610.35" dur="6.659">here Trump is going to turn around and</text>
  <text start="613.47" dur="7.44">say listen I told you raising the rates</text>
  <text start="617.009" dur="8.721">is not a good thing I even said the</text>
  <text start="620.91" dur="9.45">market was affected by the Fed when they</text>
  <text start="625.73" dur="7.299">increased the rates and going back in</text>
  <text start="630.36" dur="5.01">time he&amp;#39;s going to say look I said this</text>
  <text start="633.029" dur="5.341">they&amp;#39;re the ones who are responsible for</text>
  <text start="635.37" dur="4.74">this and look who defended them and who</text>
  <text start="638.37" dur="5.67">supported them who said they were doing</text>
  <text start="640.11" dur="8.19">a great job the IMF the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="644.04" dur="5.729">they came out and said no they know what</text>
  <text start="648.3" dur="4.349">they&amp;#39;re doing the Fed knows what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="649.769" dur="6.3">doing it&amp;#39;s okay so who&amp;#39;s responsible for</text>
  <text start="652.649" dur="6.721">this system collapsing the mainstream</text>
  <text start="656.069" dur="5.851">media backing the Fed the IMF backing</text>
  <text start="659.37" dur="5.55">the Fed and the Fed is to blame for this</text>
  <text start="661.92" dur="6.019">collapse now again as they raise rates</text>
  <text start="664.92" dur="6.269">once again we&amp;#39;re going to hear Trump</text>
  <text start="667.939" dur="6.64">contradict the Fed again and again and</text>
  <text start="671.189" dur="8.041">again to get his message across to build</text>
  <text start="674.579" dur="9.421">this up so everyone is defending the Fed</text>
  <text start="679.23" dur="7.919">and when the system comes down Trump</text>
  <text start="684" dur="5.04">will go back in time and say I said the</text>
  <text start="687.149" dur="3.961">Fed was responsible for this for this</text>
  <text start="689.04" dur="5.64">for this for this for this and then the</text>
  <text start="691.11" dur="6.469">economy collapsed look at my economy we</text>
  <text start="694.68" dur="5.67">had the best GDP unemployment the lowest</text>
  <text start="697.579" dur="5.11">manufacturing was coming back and look</text>
  <text start="700.35" dur="5.539">what the Fed did and the IMF supported</text>
  <text start="702.689" dur="7.58">this the mainstream media supported this</text>
  <text start="705.889" dur="7.3">see the plan now see what he&amp;#39;s doing and</text>
  <text start="710.269" dur="5.591">we&amp;#39;re going to see more of this actually</text>
  <text start="713.189" dur="4.83">right now we see that Turkey is making a</text>
  <text start="715.86" dur="2.399">big move now we need to go back a little</text>
  <text start="718.019" dur="2.13">bit</text>
  <text start="718.259" dur="2.531">remember Russia has been telling every</text>
  <text start="720.149" dur="4.961">single country</text>
  <text start="720.79" dur="6.54">to use its national currency don&amp;#39;t use a</text>
  <text start="725.11" dur="5.07">centralized currency use your own</text>
