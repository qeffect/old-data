  <text start="37.24" dur="5.76">is jun 29th 2016 and thought of the</text>
  <text start="40.36" dur="6.84">episode is did the central bankers plan</text>
  <text start="43" dur="6.69">the brexit to create an EU empire let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="47.2" dur="5.039">get into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="49.69" dur="4.65">news now what a day on the market here</text>
  <text start="52.239" dur="4.14">we have two days now where the market</text>
  <text start="54.34" dur="6.48">has been pushed up but something very</text>
  <text start="56.379" dur="7.411">interestingly gold has stayed above 1300</text>
  <text start="60.82" dur="4.26">and this is something that we do need to</text>
  <text start="63.79" dur="4.29">watch we&amp;#39;ve been talking about this</text>
  <text start="65.08" dur="4.77">quite a bit where we need to watch where</text>
  <text start="68.08" dur="4.56">gold goes because when we see gold</text>
  <text start="69.85" dur="5.79">moving up by seventy eighty a hundred</text>
  <text start="72.64" dur="4.71">one hundred and fifty dollars this is</text>
  <text start="75.64" dur="4.47">the signal and if you notice these jumps</text>
  <text start="77.35" dur="4.83">are getting larger and larger and the</text>
  <text start="80.11" dur="4.77">suppressions it&amp;#39;s getting more and more</text>
  <text start="82.18" dur="4.35">difficult to push this down now does</text>
  <text start="84.88" dur="3.87">this mean that they won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="86.53" dur="4.56">push this down below 1300 no that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="88.75" dur="5.13">that what this means they could try to</text>
  <text start="91.09" dur="5.459">do it and we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch</text>
  <text start="93.88" dur="4.95">that situation very carefully now out in</text>
  <text start="96.549" dur="5.011">the eurozone we see the economic</text>
  <text start="98.83" dur="5.07">confidence well it is dipped in June it</text>
  <text start="101.56" dur="6.239">edged lower as the corporate media likes</text>
  <text start="103.9" dur="9.329">to say and it went down from 10 4.6 to</text>
  <text start="107.799" dur="7.86">10 4.4 and we can see right now that the</text>
  <text start="113.229" dur="6.801">reason for this is what&amp;#39;s happening with</text>
  <text start="115.659" dur="6.661">the brexit what&amp;#39;s going on in Europe and</text>
  <text start="120.03" dur="4.42">when we look at this we see the business</text>
  <text start="122.32" dur="4.56">climate indicator that is also declined</text>
  <text start="124.45" dur="6.39">by point 22 for the month from point two</text>
  <text start="126.88" dur="6.21">six and we can see that things are</text>
  <text start="130.84" dur="4.709">continually deteriorating nothing is</text>
  <text start="133.09" dur="4.86">improving here yes we do have our little</text>
  <text start="135.549" dur="4.341">bump ups but what happens once we have</text>
  <text start="137.95" dur="4.83">this little spike or this little surge</text>
  <text start="139.89" dur="4.96">all of a sudden it drops even larger as</text>
  <text start="142.78" dur="5.13">we move down and the trend is</text>
  <text start="144.85" dur="4.68">continually moving downward and when we</text>
  <text start="147.91" dur="4.47">look at the spending here in the United</text>
  <text start="149.53" dur="4.44">States back in April we know gas prices</text>
  <text start="152.38" dur="3.66">started to go up and everyone was like</text>
  <text start="153.97" dur="4.23">oh look spending this all out there</text>
  <text start="156.04" dur="4.5">again but now gas prices have kind of</text>
  <text start="158.2" dur="5.58">leveled off and we see that spending</text>
  <text start="160.54" dur="8.84">guess what in May it is dropped back</text>
  <text start="163.78" dur="9.45">down and spending is going nowhere and</text>
  <text start="169.38" dur="7.689">why is this well income is dropping it</text>
  <text start="173.23" dur="6.9">is the weakest since March 2014 people</text>
  <text start="177.069" dur="5.851">are being laid off people don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="180.13" dur="4.29">ability to save people are worried about</text>
  <text start="182.92" dur="3.99">their jobs they&amp;#39;re not out there</text>
  <text start="184.42" dur="5.91">spending in retail and we have a major</text>
  <text start="186.91" dur="5.22">problem here now we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="190.33" dur="4.379">real estate it&amp;#39;s starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="192.13" dur="5.07">which is very odd because during this</text>
  <text start="194.709" dur="4.951">period of time the summer the hot months</text>
  <text start="197.2" dur="5.52">no pun intended there this is when real</text>
  <text start="199.66" dur="5.52">estate really picks up when you go into</text>
  <text start="202.72" dur="3.78">the spring you go into the summer most</text>
  <text start="205.18" dur="3.12">of the people want to be in their homes</text>
  <text start="206.5" dur="4.26">right before school they want to be</text>
  <text start="208.3" dur="6.469">settled in it&amp;#39;s warm flowers are</text>
  <text start="210.76" dur="7.53">blooming and everyone is excited and</text>
  <text start="214.769" dur="5.47">usually winter is the time where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="218.29" dur="4.35">not so great and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="220.239" dur="3.951">now is that things were really rapidly</text>
  <text start="222.64" dur="3.929">falling apart prices are coming down</text>
  <text start="224.19" dur="4.15">pending home sales they&amp;#39;ve plunged by</text>
  <text start="226.569" dur="4.711">three-point-seven percent this is the</text>
  <text start="228.34" dur="6.75">biggest drop since May of 2010 sales</text>
  <text start="231.28" dur="5.4">declined in all four regions and what</text>
  <text start="235.09" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now this is the first</text>
  <text start="236.68" dur="4.83">annual drop in home sales in two years</text>
  <text start="239.56" dur="4.769">of course they&amp;#39;re out they&amp;#39;re blaming</text>
  <text start="241.51" dur="5.699">supply there&amp;#39;s not enough supply people</text>
  <text start="244.329" dur="4.561">just can&amp;#39;t find the right house well</text>
  <text start="247.209" dur="3.541">when we look at all the economic</text>
  <text start="248.89" dur="4.23">indicators and we look at what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="250.75" dur="4.62">on here we see that maybe people just</text>
  <text start="253.12" dur="3.69">can&amp;#39;t afford it because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="255.37" dur="3.35">seeing is that people are even applying</text>
  <text start="256.81" dur="6.169">for mortgages I mean they&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="258.72" dur="6.819">historical low interest rates right now</text>
  <text start="262.979" dur="5.381">you would think people would be running</text>
  <text start="265.539" dur="6.981">to the banks to take out loans but we</text>
  <text start="268.36" dur="8.61">don&amp;#39;t see this we don&amp;#39;t see this at all</text>
  <text start="272.52" dur="7.06">actually going back 2013 as interest</text>
  <text start="276.97" dur="4.68">rates continually came down mortgage</text>
  <text start="279.58" dur="5.85">companies were laying off people tens of</text>
  <text start="281.65" dur="6.18">thousands and this was the same time</text>
  <text start="285.43" dur="4.5">Obama was in Phoenix back in 2013</text>
  <text start="287.83" dur="4.89">telling everyone that the housing market</text>
  <text start="289.93" dur="6.66">is rebounding while all this was created</text>
  <text start="292.72" dur="4.98">by bubbles it was pumped up and the</text>
  <text start="296.59" dur="5.1">housing market is</text>
  <text start="297.7" dur="7.89">cloning right now we see the delinquency</text>
  <text start="301.69" dur="8.61">rate on loans well it is getting worse</text>
  <text start="305.59" dur="7.83">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="310.3" dur="7.95">delinquency rate is the most useful</text>
  <text start="313.42" dur="8.49">indicator for credit stress and it tells</text>
  <text start="318.25" dur="4.95">us that we have major problems here</text>
  <text start="321.91" dur="3.72">because the delinquency rate on</text>
  <text start="323.2" dur="6.06">commercial and industrial loans it is</text>
  <text start="325.63" dur="5.4">increased by fifty percent and in a</text>
  <text start="329.26" dur="4.65">single quarter delinquency rates in the</text>
  <text start="331.03" dur="6.57">US banking sector exploded from one</text>
  <text start="333.91" dur="7.17">percent to 1.5% so we can see the cycle</text>
  <text start="337.6" dur="6.51">has completely turned and the Lincoln</text>
  <text start="341.08" dur="6.69">searay in Europe it is also on the rise</text>
  <text start="344.11" dur="7.23">actually Italian banks it&amp;#39;s a disaster</text>
  <text start="347.77" dur="6.08">there they have very high delinquency</text>
  <text start="351.34" dur="5.1">rates right now and they are in trouble</text>
  <text start="353.85" dur="4.69">now we know the Fed was out there</text>
  <text start="356.44" dur="4.56">talking about how they were going to</text>
  <text start="358.54" dur="4.26">increase the interest rates where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="361" dur="4.77">going to do a rate hike it&amp;#39;s coming up</text>
  <text start="362.8" dur="5.01">soon and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="365.77" dur="6">that&amp;#39;s off the table because of the</text>
  <text start="367.81" dur="5.37">brexit there is a 0% chance right now</text>
  <text start="371.77" dur="3.96">that there&amp;#39;s going to be any type of</text>
  <text start="373.18" dur="4.76">rate hike well we never really thought</text>
  <text start="375.73" dur="4.53">there was going to be a rate hike again</text>
  <text start="377.94" dur="5.08">there&amp;#39;s a twenty three percent chance of</text>
  <text start="380.26" dur="4.44">a rate cut well we know that Japan we</text>
  <text start="383.02" dur="4.38">know that Europe they&amp;#39;re a negative</text>
  <text start="384.7" dur="5.34">interest rate territory and we can see</text>
  <text start="387.4" dur="4.83">right now this is exactly where the US</text>
  <text start="390.04" dur="3.84">has headed because as the debt</text>
  <text start="392.23" dur="4.92">continually grows as the economy</text>
  <text start="393.88" dur="5.37">continually weakens as everything all</text>
  <text start="397.15" dur="6.03">the in economic indicators continually</text>
  <text start="399.25" dur="7.02">deteriorate there&amp;#39;s no other place for</text>
  <text start="403.18" dur="5.49">the central bank&amp;#39;s to go except into</text>
  <text start="406.27" dur="8.01">negative territory to keep the system</text>
  <text start="408.67" dur="9.27">alive we see out in Puerto Rico the</text>
  <text start="414.28" dur="5.88">Senate they have voted 68 to 32 and they</text>
  <text start="417.94" dur="4.02">pass the measure to bail out puerto rico</text>
  <text start="420.16" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re going to restructure the 7</text>
  <text start="421.96" dur="4.83">billion 70 billion in debt and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="424.75" dur="6.779">going to establish an outside control</text>
  <text start="426.79" dur="6.659">board to take control of puerto rico</text>
  <text start="431.529" dur="3.8">and we know that Obama&amp;#39;s going to sign</text>
  <text start="433.449" dur="3.63">this because he supports the package and</text>
  <text start="435.329" dur="3.94">they&amp;#39;re going to have to do this very</text>
  <text start="437.079" dur="4.26">very quickly by tomorrow it most likely</text>
  <text start="439.269" dur="3.9">will be signed and we know from the</text>
  <text start="441.339" dur="4.65">beginning that they weren&amp;#39;t going to let</text>
  <text start="443.169" dur="7.14">Puerto Rico default because they need to</text>
  <text start="445.989" dur="6.5">keep the system operational and we can</text>
  <text start="450.309" dur="4.98">see the brexit it is spreading</text>
  <text start="452.489" dur="6.73">throughout Europe and government</text>
  <text start="455.289" dur="5.61">employees individuals countries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="459.219" dur="4.05">all looking to have some type of</text>
  <text start="460.899" dur="5.52">referendum they&amp;#39;re realizing what the</text>
  <text start="463.269" dur="9.39">European Union really is and marine</text>
  <text start="466.419" dur="9.3">lepen wrote an argument that said we</text>
  <text start="472.659" dur="6.12">need to end the EU right now because</text>
  <text start="475.719" dur="5.82">each of the 28 countries that constitute</text>
  <text start="478.779" dur="5.3">it has slowly lost its democratic</text>
  <text start="481.539" dur="6.12">prerogatives two commissions and</text>
  <text start="484.079" dur="5.98">councils with no popular mandate every</text>
  <text start="487.659" dur="5.07">nation in the union has had to apply</text>
  <text start="490.059" dur="4.08">laws it did not want for itself member</text>
  <text start="492.729" dur="4.53">nations no longer determine their own</text>
  <text start="494.139" dur="5.82">budgets they are called upon to open</text>
  <text start="497.259" dur="4.83">their borders against their will and one</text>
  <text start="499.959" dur="3.48">thing is certain Britain&amp;#39;s departure</text>
  <text start="502.089" dur="4.41">from the European Union will not make</text>
  <text start="503.439" dur="5.69">the Union more democratic well I agree</text>
  <text start="506.499" dur="7.2">with that completely I mean this is a</text>
  <text start="509.129" dur="7.6">non-elected body of individuals making</text>
  <text start="513.699" dur="4.83">decisions for all of these different</text>
  <text start="516.729" dur="4.65">countries now remember this is a central</text>
  <text start="518.529" dur="7.321">bank organization they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="521.379" dur="9.481">people to make decisions but we can see</text>
  <text start="525.85" dur="8.339">there&amp;#39;s confusion going on this is kind</text>
  <text start="530.86" dur="6.99">of a stall tactic going on right now we</text>
  <text start="534.189" dur="12.21">see the European Union they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="537.85" dur="11.099">push the UK into enacting article 50 we</text>
  <text start="546.399" dur="6.6">see the UK saying and this is coming</text>
  <text start="548.949" dur="8.01">from Cameron let&amp;#39;s wait this is very</text>
  <text start="552.999" dur="5.731">interesting situation and this might be</text>
  <text start="556.959" dur="4.98">by design and we&amp;#39;re going to talk about</text>
  <text start="558.73" dur="6.27">that in a second but John Kerry is out</text>
  <text start="561.939" dur="5.881">there and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="565" dur="4.98">that you know something united kingdom</text>
  <text start="567.82" dur="5.13">it could be reversed the decision that</text>
  <text start="569.98" dur="5.67">no to leave the the European Union maybe</text>
  <text start="572.95" dur="5.55">we can reverse it he said this is a very</text>
  <text start="575.65" dur="9.06">complicated divorce there are a number</text>
  <text start="578.5" dur="8.91">of ways to walk back the vote and we can</text>
  <text start="584.71" dur="8.13">see right now this might be part of</text>
  <text start="587.41" dur="9.15">their plan because we understand the</text>
  <text start="592.84" dur="5.28">central bankers they like control they</text>
  <text start="596.56" dur="5.16">like to control people they like to</text>
  <text start="598.12" dur="5.81">control governments they put countries</text>
  <text start="601.72" dur="6.24">into debt they have a debt bait system</text>
  <text start="603.93" dur="9.07">which by design will impoverish a</text>
  <text start="607.96" dur="8.4">country and slave a people and this</text>
  <text start="613" dur="5.34">brexit while other people are out there</text>
  <text start="616.36" dur="3.24">saying this is a great thing which I</text>
  <text start="618.34" dur="3.36">agree it is a good thing that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="619.6" dur="6.33">trying to get away from a central</text>
  <text start="621.7" dur="7.889">banking system I have to wonder and when</text>
  <text start="625.93" dur="8.34">I look at the information was this by</text>
  <text start="629.589" dur="7.321">design think about this for a second we</text>
  <text start="634.27" dur="4.8">understand false flags where the</text>
  <text start="636.91" dur="6">government&amp;#39;s the central bankers will</text>
  <text start="639.07" dur="8.88">use an incident and try to make people</text>
  <text start="642.91" dur="12.72">do something they want when we look at</text>
  <text start="647.95" dur="14.04">this was it really the idea to have the</text>
  <text start="655.63" dur="8.85">UK remain in the EU or were they trying</text>
  <text start="661.99" dur="6.18">to convince everyone that&amp;#39;s what was</text>
  <text start="664.48" dur="7.609">their plan and make the people feel they</text>
  <text start="668.17" dur="7.26">had a choice remember central bankers</text>
  <text start="672.089" dur="7.541">they plan out their moves they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="675.43" dur="7.71">devious they like control so when we</text>
  <text start="679.63" dur="7.74">look at the brexit this might actually</text>
  <text start="683.14" dur="5.64">help them this might not destroy them I</text>
  <text start="687.37" dur="3.03">know a lot of people are saying this is</text>
  <text start="688.78" dur="5.01">going to break up the EU I mean I hope</text>
  <text start="690.4" dur="5.04">it does I hope the EU breaks apart but</text>
  <text start="693.79" dur="4.2">when I try to look into the minds of the</text>
  <text start="695.44" dur="3.66">central bankers I see something very</text>
  <text start="697.99" dur="3.849">different</text>
  <text start="699.1" dur="6.07">because we see that the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="701.839" dur="5.461">giant yelling used a brexit as the</text>
  <text start="705.17" dur="5.37">primary reason for the latest rate hike</text>
  <text start="707.3" dur="6.33">delay mentioning that such conditions</text>
  <text start="710.54" dur="5.01">may influence for some time to come this</text>
  <text start="713.63" dur="8.04">indicates she may have had prior</text>
  <text start="715.55" dur="8.729">knowledge of the brexit the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="721.67" dur="6.75">central bankers all convened in Basel</text>
  <text start="724.279" dur="7.831">Switzerland very interestingly to have</text>
  <text start="728.42" dur="6.44">their meeting which has no minutes or</text>
  <text start="732.11" dur="8.25">anything like that right before the</text>
  <text start="734.86" dur="8.26">brexit vote commenced we see the</text>

  <text start="829.94" dur="4.36">what they want to</text>

  <text start="842.34" dur="7.08">all his other investments he made a huge</text>
  <text start="845.28" dur="7.71">amount of money off of this he lost a</text>
  <text start="849.42" dur="7.17">very little bit he gained a lot so he</text>
  <text start="852.99" dur="6.72">kind of knew what was happening but to</text>
  <text start="856.59" dur="7.65">convince everyone that he had no idea we</text>
  <text start="859.71" dur="7.2">can see how this was created and a lot</text>
  <text start="864.24" dur="9.06">of these things just happened all at</text>
  <text start="866.91" dur="11.64">once so when we look at this was this</text>
  <text start="873.3" dur="7.35">some type of false flag if you will to</text>
  <text start="878.55" dur="8.04">make the people believe that they had a</text>
