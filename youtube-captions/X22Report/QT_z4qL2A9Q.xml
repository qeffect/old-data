  <text start="62.88" dur="5.76">January 12th 2018 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="66.06" dur="5.85">episode is to convince the public this</text>
  <text start="68.64" dur="5.16">is what the Cabal does let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="71.91" dur="4.83">the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="73.8" dur="5.67">geopolitical news now the Cabal is</text>
  <text start="76.74" dur="5.49">becoming very very very desperate and</text>
  <text start="79.47" dur="4.14">like I said eventually the what they</text>
  <text start="82.23" dur="4.249">were going to do is they were going to</text>
  <text start="83.61" dur="4.86">try everything they possibly can to</text>
  <text start="86.479" dur="4.301">bring down Trump</text>
  <text start="88.47" dur="5.09">the administration those Patriots that</text>
  <text start="90.78" dur="5.67">are trying to take the country back and</text>
  <text start="93.56" dur="7.66">what they&amp;#39;re out there doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="96.45" dur="7.89">pushing a story that Trump used a curse</text>
  <text start="101.22" dur="4.83">word when he was describing other people</text>
  <text start="104.34" dur="4.65">from other countries and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="106.05" dur="4.89">saying he said was why are we having all</text>
  <text start="108.99" dur="5.129">these people from shithole countries</text>
  <text start="110.94" dur="6.929">come here and then they started to push</text>
  <text start="114.119" dur="6.06">the idea that he&amp;#39;s racist and you need</text>
  <text start="117.869" dur="4.89">to understand how the cabal works they</text>
  <text start="120.179" dur="6.231">work with the corporate media one in the</text>
  <text start="122.759" dur="6.661">same and since they have the ability to</text>
  <text start="126.41" dur="5.11">control the corporate media they can put</text>
  <text start="129.42" dur="4.23">out stories and have every single one of</text>
  <text start="131.52" dur="3.36">the networks repeat the same exact story</text>
  <text start="133.65" dur="3.99">and we&amp;#39;ve seen this with Conan O&amp;#39;Brien</text>
  <text start="134.88" dur="4.23">where each one of the networks just keep</text>
  <text start="137.64" dur="3.84">repeating the same exact thing it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="139.11" dur="4.35">scripted and when they do this as they</text>
  <text start="141.48" dur="3.33">try to convince people since its</text>
  <text start="143.46" dur="3.45">repeated over and over and over it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="144.81" dur="4.11">almost like brainwashing it must be true</text>
  <text start="146.91" dur="2.58">if they all have it now that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="148.92" dur="2.37">mean it&amp;#39;s true</text>
  <text start="149.49" dur="3.6">it just means everyone&amp;#39;s repeating it I</text>
  <text start="151.29" dur="4.14">mean they repeatedly rush it in</text>
  <text start="153.09" dur="2.85">collusion how many times doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="155.43" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s true</text>
  <text start="155.94" dur="5.129">they repeated a lot of things it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="159.36" dur="2.97">mean it&amp;#39;s true even if they have their</text>
  <text start="161.069" dur="3.061">fact checkers which we know they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="162.33" dur="3.51">checking facts they&amp;#39;re checking against</text>
  <text start="164.13" dur="3.57">the intelligence agencies to say here</text>
  <text start="165.84" dur="4.26">are the real facts even though he</text>
  <text start="167.7" dur="4.92">manipulated all the facts so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="170.1" dur="5.58">pushing this story and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="172.62" dur="4.5">everything they possibly can to get</text>
  <text start="175.68" dur="3.2">Trump out of office that&amp;#39;s really what</text>
  <text start="177.12" dur="4.949">they want they don&amp;#39;t want him there</text>
  <text start="178.88" dur="5.23">because he&amp;#39;s undoing everything they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="182.069" dur="3.021">done over the many years and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="184.11" dur="3.65">just him</text>
  <text start="185.09" dur="6.58">he&amp;#39;s just the frontman</text>
  <text start="187.76" dur="6.07">that&amp;#39;s it they have other people working</text>
  <text start="191.67" dur="4.2">behind the scenes that are helping him</text>
  <text start="193.83" dur="2.94">who are true patriots who want the</text>
  <text start="195.87" dur="4.5">country back</text>
  <text start="196.77" dur="5.13">and of course Trump is out there and</text>
  <text start="200.37" dur="3.75">he&amp;#39;s gonna say this is a fake news story</text>
  <text start="201.9" dur="4.41">he&amp;#39;s already denying that he even said</text>
  <text start="204.12" dur="4.65">that actually he said yes I used tough</text>
  <text start="206.31" dur="4.53">language during his immigration reform</text>
  <text start="208.77" dur="3.6">meeting with members of Congress but he</text>
  <text start="210.84" dur="2.67">says this is not the type of language</text>
  <text start="212.37" dur="4.83">that I would use</text>
  <text start="213.51" dur="5.97">I don&amp;#39;t speak like this and what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="217.2" dur="3.78">to happen is yes the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="219.48" dur="3.78">gonna play this over and over people are</text>
  <text start="220.98" dur="4.56">gonna have to huge discussions over it</text>
  <text start="223.26" dur="4.14">analyzing how he&amp;#39;s a racist and things</text>
  <text start="225.54" dur="3.48">like that and while that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="227.4" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re also gonna bring up other</text>
  <text start="229.02" dur="3.96">stories another story that&amp;#39;s coming out</text>
  <text start="231.75" dur="3.03">right now this is coming out from The</text>
  <text start="232.98" dur="5.34">Wall Street Journal and they just revive</text>
  <text start="234.78" dur="8.01">the same exact story how he how his</text>
  <text start="238.32" dur="6.27">lawyers paid a porn star like $130,000</text>
  <text start="242.79" dur="4.53">to stay quiet or something like that and</text>
  <text start="244.59" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re just gonna continually push</text>
  <text start="247.32" dur="2.58">these stories out there because what</text>
  <text start="248.61" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="249.9" dur="5.43">to build a momentum to convince the</text>
  <text start="253.26" dur="2.58">public this is why he needs to be</text>
  <text start="255.33" dur="3.63">impeached</text>
  <text start="255.84" dur="5.01">now again none of them ever turned out</text>
  <text start="258.96" dur="3.69">to be true they just keep repeating the</text>
  <text start="260.85" dur="4.89">same things and hopefully something</text>
  <text start="262.65" dur="7.43">catches and every time they try to do</text>
  <text start="265.74" dur="7.86">this they fail now we need to understand</text>
  <text start="270.08" dur="8.5">why they&amp;#39;re so upset about what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="273.6" dur="9.18">trying to do with immigration why are</text>
  <text start="278.58" dur="9.06">these individuals willing to push this</text>

  <text start="326.969" dur="5.01">went on to say they want to protect the</text>
  <text start="328.83" dur="5.91">American workers the president supports</text>

  <text start="363.899" dur="5.31">a murim memorandum some people say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="366.149" dur="6.841">an executive order but it&amp;#39;s there what</text>
  <text start="369.209" dur="6.74">this does it allows some immigrants who</text>
  <text start="372.99" dur="6.929">came into the US illegally as children</text>
  <text start="375.949" dur="7">from being deported immediately it is</text>
  <text start="379.919" dur="5.46">fairly expensive allowing any individual</text>

  <text start="402.509" dur="3.63">adults who may have been in the</text>
  <text start="404.699" dur="5.28">workforce for over ten years</text>
  <text start="406.139" dur="6.36">the idea is to allow these people time</text>
  <text start="409.979" dur="4.71">to make the move to legalize status in</text>
  <text start="412.499" dur="4.2">the country but it also amounts to an</text>
  <text start="414.689" dur="5.04">amnesty in many ways because the</text>
  <text start="416.699" dur="5.61">deferral can be renewed the charge made</text>
  <text start="419.729" dur="4.68">by liberals and the media is of course</text>
  <text start="422.309" dur="5.19">to betray the intent to phase this</text>
  <text start="424.409" dur="5.73">program out as cruelty to children when</text>
  <text start="427.499" dur="5.82">in fact many of these people they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="430.139" dur="5.54">children at all but working adults who</text>
  <text start="433.319" dur="4.68">are gaming the US tax system by not</text>
  <text start="435.679" dur="6.22">participating in the American structure</text>
  <text start="437.999" dur="5.43">as citizens illegal aliens are often</text>
  <text start="441.899" dur="4.05">paid off the books for the work and</text>
  <text start="443.429" dur="5.28">although this can mean low wages it also</text>
  <text start="445.949" dur="6.27">means that what wages these people get</text>
  <text start="448.709" dur="5.46">they get to keep it all gaining legal</text>
  <text start="452.219" dur="3.75">status in the US means</text>
  <text start="454.169" dur="3.24">what it does in any country that that</text>
  <text start="455.969" dur="3.51">person becomes subject to the laws</text>
  <text start="457.409" dur="5.461">including those of taxation in that</text>
  <text start="459.479" dur="6.56">country now remember these people are</text>
  <text start="462.87" dur="5.43">coming into this country illegally and</text>
  <text start="466.039" dur="3.641">the reason why they need these</text>
  <text start="468.3" dur="4.619">individuals and this goes back to the</text>
  <text start="469.68" dur="5.459">TPP and then not just the TPP but for</text>
  <text start="472.919" dur="5.821">many reasons is because once that was in</text>
  <text start="475.139" dur="5.37">place every person in this country and</text>
  <text start="478.74" dur="5.449">they&amp;#39;re allowed to bring any more people</text>
  <text start="480.509" dur="5.701">into this they were going to make the</text>
  <text start="484.189" dur="3.97">salaries the income that these</text>
  <text start="486.21" dur="5.37">individuals and the people of the United</text>
  <text start="488.159" dur="5.25">States even because what they wanted to</text>
  <text start="491.58" dur="4.109">do is they wanted to bring people from</text>
  <text start="493.409" dur="4.171">other countries into this country and</text>
  <text start="495.689" dur="4.29">they would work in factories in this</text>
  <text start="497.58" dur="5.13">country making the same salary they were</text>
  <text start="499.979" dur="4.351">making in the other countries what would</text>
  <text start="502.71" dur="4.769">what would that do to the American</text>
  <text start="504.33" dur="5.309">worker it would put them out of work the</text>
  <text start="507.479" dur="4.8">American worker would have to drop their</text>
  <text start="509.639" dur="4.02">salary to that level this is all the</text>
  <text start="512.279" dur="2.94">one-world government type of thing</text>
  <text start="513.659" dur="5.461">that&amp;#39;s what they wanted to do with the</text>
  <text start="515.219" dur="7.5">TPP but that got shot down there are</text>
  <text start="519.12" dur="5.85">other things that allows why they wanted</text>
  <text start="522.719" dur="3.68">these individuals in here one because</text>
  <text start="524.97" dur="3.989">they know that they would vote for</text>
  <text start="526.399" dur="6.091">Democrats which they can&amp;#39;t really do but</text>
  <text start="528.959" dur="6.87">again they game the voting system and</text>
  <text start="532.49" dur="4.779">while not having legal status can be</text>
  <text start="535.829" dur="2.7">harder in terms of not being able to</text>
  <text start="537.269" dur="4.081">receive some services in the United</text>
  <text start="538.529" dur="6.091">States like a driver&amp;#39;s license and other</text>
  <text start="541.35" dur="5.97">services well a lot of these laws</text>
  <text start="544.62" dur="5.7">pertaining to this were done away with</text>
  <text start="547.32" dur="4.92">in other words they gain an ID without</text>
  <text start="550.32" dur="3.72">responsibility to participate in some of</text>
  <text start="552.24" dur="4.589">the less fun aspects of living in the</text>
  <text start="554.04" dur="4.799">u.s. like paying taxes now the meeting</text>
  <text start="556.829" dur="3.961">that made the news today with President</text>
  <text start="558.839" dur="4.021">Trump allegedly cursing was different</text>
  <text start="560.79" dur="5.43">than the televised meeting from a day</text>
  <text start="562.86" dur="6.9">before however it provided a lot of</text>
  <text start="566.22" dur="6.03">fodder for the anti-trump press after</text>
  <text start="569.76" dur="3.96">unusually dignified and surprising</text>
  <text start="572.25" dur="3.6">televised meeting with a wide</text>
  <text start="573.72" dur="4.19">ideological slice of congressional</text>
  <text start="575.85" dur="5.4">members the day before and of course</text>
  <text start="577.91" dur="5.14">they have no records of this they have</text>
  <text start="581.25" dur="4.5">no tape recording of this they have no</text>
  <text start="583.05" dur="3.93">filming of this they&amp;#39;re just out there</text>
  <text start="585.75" dur="3.54">saying that this is what he</text>
  <text start="586.98" dur="5.099">said and he&amp;#39;s saying no this is not what</text>
  <text start="589.29" dur="5.88">I said and every time this comes up it</text>
  <text start="592.079" dur="6.57">turns out the corporate media has lied</text>
  <text start="595.17" dur="5.82">and we see right now they are pushing</text>
  <text start="598.649" dur="5.851">their agenda as hard as they possibly</text>
  <text start="600.99" dur="5.82">can because what they have in place</text>
  <text start="604.5" dur="4.68">they don&amp;#39;t want removed and this is what</text>
  <text start="606.81" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re doing right now all of these</text>

  <text start="621.029" dur="5.49">south and they don&amp;#39;t want all of this to</text>
  <text start="624.449" dur="4.38">disappear because that means they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="626.519" dur="4.591">done for so what they&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="628.829" dur="5.161">is they&amp;#39;re trying to push their agenda</text>
  <text start="631.11" dur="4.86">to keep what they have but it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="633.99" dur="3.3">falling apart very very quickly and you</text>
  <text start="635.97" dur="4.729">can see the only thing they have left is</text>
  <text start="637.29" dur="7.229">to call em a womanizer or racist and</text>

  <text start="701.79" dur="5.01">chief General Joseph Votel has assured</text>
  <text start="704.73" dur="4.74">the head of Pakistan&amp;#39;s army that the</text>
  <text start="706.8" dur="5.58">u.s. is not contemplating any unilateral</text>

  <text start="712.38" dur="3.66">very worried that maybe they would have</text>
  <text start="714.42" dur="3.12">regime change or something like that and</text>
  <text start="716.04" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re saying that no we&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="717.54" dur="5.28">be doing anything the whole plan here</text>
  <text start="720.78" dur="3.81">was to shut down the Cabal in</text>
  <text start="722.82" dur="4.68">Afghanistan that&amp;#39;s what this was all</text>
  <text start="724.59" dur="7.17">about to shut down the roots to make</text>
  <text start="727.5" dur="6.63">sure that the terrorists in the country</text>
  <text start="731.76" dur="5.82">those individuals that are working for</text>
  <text start="734.13" dur="5.04">the Cabal they have nowhere to go and to</text>
  <text start="737.58" dur="4.59">shut down supplies and things like that</text>
  <text start="739.17" dur="4.02">to get rid of the poppy fields and this</text>
  <text start="742.17" dur="2.46">is what&amp;#39;s happening right now and</text>
  <text start="743.19" dur="2.85">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is all</text>
  <text start="744.63" dur="2.76">those troops in Afghanistan they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="746.04" dur="2.94">gonna actually end up leaving just like</text>
  <text start="747.39" dur="3.36">the troops leaving in Iraq they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="748.98" dur="2.88">be leaving Syria and they&amp;#39;ll be talking</text>
  <text start="750.75" dur="3.42">about Syria in just a minute</text>
  <text start="751.86" dur="6.48">and we see that all of this is now</text>
  <text start="754.17" dur="8.31">happening in real time now Russia is out</text>
  <text start="758.34" dur="7.47">there and they are saying that the US</text>
  <text start="762.48" dur="4.56">has de facto occupied parts of Syria</text>
  <text start="765.81" dur="2.85">like the LTF</text>
  <text start="767.04" dur="4.17">area and they&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="768.66" dur="5.73">blocking humanitarian aid to these</text>
  <text start="771.21" dur="4.74">refugee camps in certain areas and I</text>
  <text start="774.39" dur="3.03">think what Russia is gonna end up doing</text>
  <text start="775.95" dur="3.93">here and this is why they&amp;#39;re saying this</text>
  <text start="777.42" dur="5.22">is they&amp;#39;re gonna be going to the UN to</text>
  <text start="779.88" dur="5.85">say that the US has no right to be in</text>
  <text start="782.64" dur="4.98">Syria and Trump is gonna have to make a</text>
  <text start="785.73" dur="3.21">decision at this point in time just like</text>
  <text start="787.62" dur="4.41">he made a decision with the Iran</text>
  <text start="788.94" dur="5.85">sanctions where he waived the Iranian</text>
  <text start="792.03" dur="7.23">sanctions and of course he said for the</text>
  <text start="794.79" dur="6.6">last time now once again there he has no</text>
  <text start="799.26" dur="4.17">choice and he didn&amp;#39;t want to place more</text>
  <text start="801.39" dur="3.6">sanctions on Iran now I know the</text>
  <text start="803.43" dur="2.91">Treasury Department placed certain</text>
  <text start="804.99" dur="2.91">sanctions on two individuals like</text>
  <text start="806.34" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;ve done with Russia it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="807.9" dur="7.05">meaningless it doesn&amp;#39;t do anything did</text>
  <text start="811.47" dur="7.32">deal with Iran was originally put into</text>
  <text start="814.95" dur="6.21">place so they never acquired nuclear</text>
  <text start="818.79" dur="4.23">weapons that&amp;#39;s what it was really about</text>
  <text start="821.16" dur="5.25">because they knew once they got into</text>
  <text start="823.02" dur="6.6">Syria they&amp;#39;d be able to invade or have</text>
  <text start="826.41" dur="4.14">regime change in Iran and they wanted to</text>
  <text start="829.62" dur="4.08">make sure they didn&amp;#39;t have nuclear</text>
  <text start="830.55" dur="5.16">weapons that&amp;#39;s why they pushed that deal</text>
  <text start="833.7" dur="5.52">Trump right now is saying this is an</text>
  <text start="835.71" dur="6.9">awful deal why should they be allowed to</text>
  <text start="839.22" dur="5.34">have nuclear weapons I mean are we</text>
  <text start="842.61" dur="4.26">really stopping North Korea from getting</text>
  <text start="844.56" dur="5.91">a nuclear weapons now they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="846.87" dur="5.88">nuclear weapons that&amp;#39;s the plan is to</text>
  <text start="850.47" dur="3.809">have them into a nuclear power the plan</text>
  <text start="852.75" dur="4.41">is to have the</text>
  <text start="854.279" dur="6.451">IAEA come in and inspect and make sure</text>
  <text start="857.16" dur="5.31">that they can protect themselves because</text>
  <text start="860.73" dur="4.95">every country has the right to protect</text>
  <text start="862.47" dur="7.229">themselves this is why it&amp;#39;s a bad deal</text>
  <text start="865.68" dur="7.23">also it pushed Iran closer and closer to</text>
  <text start="869.699" dur="6.3">Russia and China and remember this is</text>
  <text start="872.91" dur="7.649">all a game right now to undo everything</text>
  <text start="875.999" dur="8.971">that Cabal has done takes time and again</text>
  <text start="880.559" dur="5.041">if we if the Patriots if trump moves too</text>
  <text start="884.97" dur="3.779">quickly</text>
  <text start="885.6" dur="6.719">the Cabal would react and the reaction</text>
  <text start="888.749" dur="5.221">is not going to be good so what he needs</text>
  <text start="892.319" dur="3.87">to do is that he needs to keep them off</text>
  <text start="893.97" dur="5.7">track on what is really going on here</text>
  <text start="896.189" dur="7.56">and shut down things at in the mean time</text>
  <text start="899.67" dur="5.789">and place investigations into certain</text>
  <text start="903.749" dur="5.13">individuals and what has gone and in the</text>
  <text start="905.459" dur="6.75">government at the same time to keep them</text>
  <text start="908.879" dur="5.791">scrambled to keep them confused so they</text>
  <text start="912.209" dur="5.401">have nothing left and if you noticed</text>
  <text start="914.67" dur="4.289">what do they have left here everything</text>
  <text start="917.61" dur="4.89">they told us was fake</text>
  <text start="918.959" dur="6.091">the Russian collusion that he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="922.5" dur="3.589">be impeached that were gonna start war</text>
  <text start="925.05" dur="3.539">with Syria</text>
  <text start="926.089" dur="4.571">thank God he bombed that base we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="928.589" dur="5.37">going in there we&amp;#39;re gonna remove a son</text>
  <text start="930.66" dur="6.26">that never happened that we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="933.959" dur="5.161">invading North Korea this is why the</text>
  <text start="936.92" dur="4.3">ships are headed towards they remember</text>
  <text start="939.12" dur="3.54">right in the beginning when the</text>
  <text start="941.22" dur="2.88">corporate media reported that the</text>
  <text start="942.66" dur="5.219">aircraft carriers were headed there and</text>
  <text start="944.1" dur="6.929">they really weren&amp;#39;t the whole thing is a</text>
  <text start="947.879" dur="6.15">game because inside of the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="951.029" dur="4.651">inside the FBI inside the CIA yes there</text>
  <text start="954.029" dur="4.68">are good people and there are those that</text>
  <text start="955.68" dur="5.699">are part of the Cabal and it takes time</text>
  <text start="958.709" dur="4.68">to remove those individuals within these</text>
  <text start="961.379" dur="4.471">departments and some of these</text>
  <text start="963.389" dur="5.161">individuals are high ranking where they</text>
  <text start="965.85" dur="7.5">have a lot of control and we see right</text>
  <text start="968.55" dur="9.81">now the entire agenda here is to slowly</text>
  <text start="973.35" dur="7.739">move and trap these individuals and then</text>
  <text start="978.36" dur="5.01">make a move on the central bank that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="981.089" dur="4.8">why he has Andrew Jackson hanging in his</text>
  <text start="983.37" dur="4.78">office it&amp;#39;s not because he&amp;#39;s on the $20</text>
  <text start="985.889" dur="6.641">bill it&amp;#39;s because he got</text>
  <text start="988.15" dur="7.82">of the central bank he was the president</text>
  <text start="992.53" dur="5.61">who got rid of them he campaigned on</text>
  <text start="995.97" dur="3.67">getting rid of the central bank yes the</text>
  <text start="998.14" dur="4.1">central bank tried to take him out they</text>
  <text start="999.64" dur="6.08">try to assassinate him it didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="1002.24" dur="6.85">but he did it</text>
  <text start="1005.72" dur="5.74">Trump and those Patriots are going to</text>
  <text start="1009.09" dur="5.22">try to do the same exact thing the</text>
  <text start="1011.46" dur="6.39">problem is is that the central bank the</text>
  <text start="1014.31" dur="6.45">Cabal they&amp;#39;ve been in government they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1017.85" dur="5.28">been behind the scenes they have plants</text>
  <text start="1020.76" dur="5.25">everywhere they&amp;#39;re like a virus that</text>
  <text start="1023.13" dur="6.03">spread throughout our system and to kill</text>
  <text start="1026.01" dur="6.54">off this virus takes time because</text>
  <text start="1029.16" dur="6.84">they&amp;#39;ve infiltrated almost everything</text>
  <text start="1032.55" dur="5.63">and we can see right now we&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="1036" dur="5.7">process of doing this it&amp;#39;s not over as</text>
  <text start="1038.18" dur="5.29">of yet but we&amp;#39;re getting very close and</text>
  <text start="1041.7" dur="3.03">this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that these individuals</text>
  <text start="1043.47" dur="2.94">aren&amp;#39;t going to try anything we can see</text>
  <text start="1044.73" dur="4.02">already with the corporate media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1046.41" dur="4.38">pushing a new agenda and they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1050.79" dur="5.76">to do whatever they can to shut this</text>
  <text start="1053.82" dur="4.98">down because they know the endgame is</text>
  <text start="1056.55" dur="3.63">not going to be good for them and who</text>
  <text start="1058.8" dur="3.54">knows if the corporate media will even</text>
  <text start="1060.18" dur="3.75">survive this because a lot of people</text>
