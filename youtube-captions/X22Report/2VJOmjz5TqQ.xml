  <text start="58.49" dur="7.35">episode 1450 8bn today&amp;#39;s date is</text>

  <text start="65.84" dur="5.22">episode is it&amp;#39;s all happening at an</text>
  <text start="68.54" dur="5.82">accelerated pace will the event be</text>
  <text start="71.06" dur="5.34">triggered let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="74.36" dur="5.28">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="76.4" dur="5.43">now yesterday we discussed how Trump</text>
  <text start="79.64" dur="5.759">released an executive order it is very</text>
  <text start="81.83" dur="4.92">quietly on Thursday and when we started</text>
  <text start="85.399" dur="3.991">to read through it we started to realize</text>
  <text start="86.75" dur="4.47">that this is about draining the swamp</text>
  <text start="89.39" dur="4.44">and when you go through the different</text>
  <text start="91.22" dur="4.86">sections like section 6 it says for the</text>
  <text start="93.83" dur="4.92">purpose of this order the term person</text>
  <text start="96.08" dur="4.77">means an individual or entity the term</text>
  <text start="98.75" dur="4.5">entity means a partnership association</text>
  <text start="100.85" dur="6.48">trust joint venture corporation group</text>
  <text start="103.25" dur="6.78">subgroup or other organization and we</text>
  <text start="107.33" dur="5.55">see that this is about going after those</text>
  <text start="110.03" dur="4.979">individuals who&amp;#39;ve been up to no good</text>
  <text start="112.88" dur="5.73">and who have been using the</text>
  <text start="115.009" dur="6.991">organization&amp;#39;s or whatever to push these</text>
  <text start="118.61" dur="6.299">certain agendas and when we look at this</text>
  <text start="122" dur="8.04">we can see that all of this has to do</text>
  <text start="124.909" dur="8.841">with the uranium 1 deal fusion GPS it</text>
  <text start="130.04" dur="6.06">has to do with the Podesta group and</text>
  <text start="133.75" dur="6.299">when you start looking through all of</text>
  <text start="136.1" dur="6.48">this you can see that a lot of this is</text>
  <text start="140.049" dur="6.401">directed right at them and especially</text>
  <text start="142.58" dur="6.99">the uranium 1 deal and we see that this</text>
  <text start="146.45" dur="5.13">is going to be used to go after them and</text>
  <text start="149.57" dur="4.38">this is just the beginning and like I</text>
  <text start="151.58" dur="4.379">said and Bill halter said coming into</text>
  <text start="153.95" dur="3.629">2018 we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more truth</text>
  <text start="155.959" dur="3.721">bombs we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more</text>
  <text start="157.579" dur="5.581">information come out and we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="159.68" dur="7.649">a lot of things happen during this year</text>
  <text start="163.16" dur="7.169">and this is going to be at an</text>
  <text start="167.329" dur="5.671">accelerated pace and the Cabal right now</text>
  <text start="170.329" dur="4.771">is running out of time they are totally</text>
  <text start="173" dur="4.47">backed into a corner and they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="175.1" dur="4.109">hit from all sides which means they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="177.47" dur="4.739">gonna become very very very desperate</text>
  <text start="179.209" dur="4.891">very soon because we can see what is</text>
  <text start="182.209" dur="2.971">happening around the Middle East we</text>
  <text start="184.1" dur="2.88">could see what&amp;#39;s happening in North</text>
  <text start="185.18" dur="5.43">Korea and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="186.98" dur="6.509">push their agenda in Ukraine now we need</text>
  <text start="190.61" dur="4.59">to understand that the Trump</text>
  <text start="193.489" dur="4.11">administration has approved the sale of</text>
  <text start="195.2" dur="3.929">lethal weapons or I should say weapons</text>
  <text start="197.599" dur="3.211">they call him lethal weapons you can</text>
  <text start="199.129" dur="3.991">call them lethal weapons this was</text>
  <text start="200.81" dur="4.92">already done under Obama this is not</text>
  <text start="203.12" dur="4.13">like this was just created this was done</text>
  <text start="205.73" dur="7.259">and we reported on this so many times</text>
  <text start="207.25" dur="8.44">during 2015-2016 going back to those</text>
  <text start="212.989" dur="4.981">periods where this was created it was</text>
  <text start="215.69" dur="5.159">voted on in Congress it&amp;#39;s the Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="217.97" dur="5.64">freedom freedom support act this has</text>
  <text start="220.849" dur="6.991">already been out there and we need to</text>
  <text start="223.61" dur="7.59">understand why now is he sending weapons</text>
  <text start="227.84" dur="6.42">out to Ukraine now we know that Trump</text>
  <text start="231.2" dur="7.23">talks to Putin we understand that he has</text>
  <text start="234.26" dur="7.14">a relationship with Putin and is it in</text>
  <text start="238.43" dur="4.8">Trump&amp;#39;s best interest to start a war in</text>
  <text start="241.4" dur="4.29">Ukraine no it makes no sense at this</text>
  <text start="243.23" dur="4.589">point in time and when we look at this</text>
  <text start="245.69" dur="3.93">we need to understand what is really</text>
  <text start="247.819" dur="3.691">happening out there and remember he was</text>
  <text start="249.62" dur="5.58">trying to push his tax bill fall through</text>
  <text start="251.51" dur="5.61">and he needed certain votes and he</text>
  <text start="255.2" dur="4.23">needed certain individuals to vote for</text>
  <text start="257.12" dur="3.839">his tax plan and he might have said</text>
  <text start="259.43" dur="5.19">listen we&amp;#39;ll send some weapons out there</text>
  <text start="260.959" dur="6.031">if you vote for my tax plan but the</text>
  <text start="264.62" dur="5.729">question is what is the bigger strategy</text>
  <text start="266.99" dur="5.22">out there because the weapons that are</text>
  <text start="270.349" dur="4.44">going out there they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="272.21" dur="6.54">change the course of what is happening</text>
  <text start="274.789" dur="6.421">in Ukraine because first of all we can</text>
  <text start="278.75" dur="4.11">see that Ukrainian forces they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="281.21" dur="3.72">want to fight against their own people</text>
  <text start="282.86" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s their own people in the south</text>
  <text start="284.93" dur="6.48">eastern region they don&amp;#39;t want to go up</text>
  <text start="287.81" dur="4.829">against them and we see right now when</text>
  <text start="291.41" dur="3.21">we look at this we have to understand</text>
  <text start="292.639" dur="3.481">are they sending these weapons out</text>
  <text start="294.62" dur="4.26">because they think Russia is going to</text>
  <text start="296.12" dur="5.13">attack we know Russia is good not gonna</text>
  <text start="298.88" dur="5.009">attack actually Trump knows that Russia</text>
  <text start="301.25" dur="8.21">in no way know how is going to attack</text>
  <text start="303.889" dur="9.09">Ukraine we understand that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="309.46" dur="5.74">Ukraine they wanted peacekeepers out in</text>
  <text start="312.979" dur="3.75">the southeastern region and they thought</text>
  <text start="315.2" dur="3.54">that Russia was going along with this</text>
  <text start="316.729" dur="4.021">but the peacekeepers were meant to keep</text>
  <text start="318.74" dur="4.35">an eye on the OSCE</text>
  <text start="320.75" dur="4.92">and it&amp;#39;s not the military police that</text>
  <text start="323.09" dur="5.76">the Ukrainians and the Cabal wanted out</text>
  <text start="325.67" dur="5.72">in the Donbass area so that didn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="328.85" dur="6.51">well for them</text>
  <text start="331.39" dur="5.53">so what other reason is there to push</text>
  <text start="335.36" dur="4.86">these weapons out there because it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="336.92" dur="4.38">going to give them an edge right now</text>
  <text start="340.22" dur="4.26">first of all they&amp;#39;re not getting the</text>
  <text start="341.3" dur="5.22">anti-tank weapons as of yet they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="344.48" dur="3.81">getting some sniper rifles and things</text>
  <text start="346.52" dur="3.87">like that yes they could use them to</text>
  <text start="348.29" dur="4.8">take out people maybe they can use it to</text>
  <text start="350.39" dur="4.71">take you know to create an event but</text>
  <text start="353.09" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s not something that it will change</text>
  <text start="355.1" dur="5.22">the course of the battle in Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="358.07" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s not going to make them win in</text>
  <text start="360.32" dur="3.3">Ukraine even if they have the anti-tank</text>
  <text start="362" dur="3.75">weapons and that&amp;#39;s not going to help at</text>
  <text start="363.62" dur="4.53">all because Russia they could fly their</text>
  <text start="365.75" dur="5.01">Air Force right into Ukraine level the</text>
  <text start="368.15" dur="3.96">entire area in one fell swoop actually</text>
  <text start="370.76" dur="2.49">only able to take their Air Force they</text>
  <text start="372.11" dur="3.84">could just fire their missiles we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="373.25" dur="6.74">seen their technology in Syria and how</text>
  <text start="375.95" dur="6.18">accurate it is and guess what the</text>
  <text start="379.99" dur="4.51">Ukrainian forces would not be able to</text>
  <text start="382.13" dur="5.039">fight against us so something else is</text>
  <text start="384.5" dur="6.15">going on here and it looks like it might</text>
  <text start="387.169" dur="6.891">be something that we aren&amp;#39;t seeing as of</text>
  <text start="390.65" dur="7.5">yet where it&amp;#39;s a deal between Russia and</text>
  <text start="394.06" dur="6.82">the US where Trump and Putin have worked</text>
  <text start="398.15" dur="5.7">something out here because we can see</text>
  <text start="400.88" dur="6.87">out in Syria for instance the whole</text>
  <text start="403.85" dur="6.78">entire plan where the Cabal had the plan</text>
  <text start="407.75" dur="5.4">to go into Syria and to you know take</text>
  <text start="410.63" dur="4.02">over and remove Assad well that has</text>
  <text start="413.15" dur="2.519">fallen apart and everything that</text>
  <text start="414.65" dur="4.5">everyone thought was going to happen</text>
  <text start="415.669" dur="5.821">actually the opposite has happened and I</text>
  <text start="419.15" dur="4.98">do believe that the opposite is going to</text>
  <text start="421.49" dur="4.26">happen right here I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="424.13" dur="4.08">what everyone thinks it&amp;#39;s going to be I</text>
  <text start="425.75" dur="4.05">really do believe at this time from all</text>
  <text start="428.21" dur="3.959">the reports and indicators that I see</text>
  <text start="429.8" dur="5.31">out there is that the forces the</text>
  <text start="432.169" dur="5.371">Pentagon that have the the lead now</text>
  <text start="435.11" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re actually going after the Islamic</text>
  <text start="437.54" dur="5.46">state and we can see that this is going</text>
  <text start="440.75" dur="5.52">to continue on throughout the Middle</text>
  <text start="443" dur="4.979">East out in Ukraine where everything the</text>
  <text start="446.27" dur="3.42">Cabal has set up it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="447.979" dur="3.87">reversed and I think in the year 2018</text>
  <text start="449.69" dur="4.159">we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot of things reversed</text>
  <text start="451.849" dur="3.86">in Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="453.849" dur="4.201">in the Middle East and in Sudan in</text>
  <text start="455.709" dur="4.8">Somalia in North Korea everything that</text>
  <text start="458.05" dur="4.169">the Cabal has been trying to push we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="460.509" dur="4.11">starting to see everything completely</text>
  <text start="462.219" dur="5.16">reverse right now we see right now that</text>
  <text start="464.619" dur="5.13">the South Korean government sources</text>
  <text start="467.379" dur="4.141">saying that they have satellite pictures</text>
  <text start="469.749" dur="3.991">from a u.s. reconnaissance satellite</text>
  <text start="471.52" dur="5.549">showing Chinese ships selling oil to</text>
  <text start="473.74" dur="6.569">North Korean vessels on the west sea</text>
  <text start="477.069" dur="5.701">around 30 times since October and once</text>
  <text start="480.309" dur="6.6">again yes there are sanctions that are</text>
  <text start="482.77" dur="7.009">in place right now and the UN has these</text>
  <text start="486.909" dur="6.57">sanctions this is completely against</text>
  <text start="489.779" dur="7.78">UNSC resolution 2375 which was adopted</text>
  <text start="493.479" dur="7.74">in September September again these</text>
  <text start="497.559" dur="5.82">countries always have a way of getting</text>
  <text start="501.219" dur="7.17">around the sanctions how do you think</text>
  <text start="503.379" dur="8.4">Cuba Iran Syria and many other countries</text>
  <text start="508.389" dur="6.15">survived all these years because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="511.779" dur="5.94">always a way to get around these</text>
  <text start="514.539" dur="5.31">sanctions these sanctions really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="517.719" dur="4.38">do much anymore and especially today</text>
  <text start="519.849" dur="5.641">they really don&amp;#39;t we see Russia is going</text>
  <text start="522.099" dur="4.771">to be selling the s400 triumph this is</text>
  <text start="525.49" dur="3.779">the latest long-range air defense</text>
  <text start="526.87" dur="5.01">missile system that went into service in</text>
  <text start="529.269" dur="4.591">2007 and they&amp;#39;re gonna be signing the</text>
  <text start="531.88" dur="5.309">deal with India soon on the delivery of</text>
  <text start="533.86" dur="5.219">s400 air defense missile systems and we</text>
  <text start="537.189" dur="4.65">see that turkeys getting these missiles</text>
  <text start="539.079" dur="4.921">India has these missiles Syria&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="541.839" dur="4.291">these type of missiles Iran is getting</text>
  <text start="544" dur="3.209">these type of missiles Saudi Arabia is</text>
  <text start="546.13" dur="3.03">going to be getting these type of</text>
  <text start="547.209" dur="4.081">missiles Egypt is going to be getting</text>
  <text start="549.16" dur="4.619">these type of missiles very soon all</text>
  <text start="551.29" dur="3.51">these countries eventually are going to</text>
  <text start="553.779" dur="2.61">get these countries and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="554.8" dur="4.07">seeing is that these countries are</text>
  <text start="556.389" dur="6.961">buying technology from Russia and China</text>
  <text start="558.87" dur="7.719">to protect themselves against the Cabal</text>
  <text start="563.35" dur="4.469">of the United States their reason why</text>
  <text start="566.589" dur="2.94">they&amp;#39;re doing this is because they</text>
  <text start="567.819" dur="3.96">understand eventually what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="569.529" dur="4.881">to do is they&amp;#39;re going to pivot away</text>
  <text start="571.779" dur="4.86">from the United States and they need</text>
  <text start="574.41" dur="5.65">protection because they&amp;#39;re very nervous</text>
  <text start="576.639" dur="5.31">about what the Cabal will do and what</text>
  <text start="580.06" dur="4.889">will happen at this time and I think</text>
  <text start="581.949" dur="5.341">once the Cabal is completely obliterated</text>
  <text start="584.949" dur="3.301">if that ever happens</text>
  <text start="587.29" dur="2.46">I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;ll have to worry</text>
  <text start="588.25" dur="3.389">about this I think the United States</text>
  <text start="589.75" dur="3.75">will be worrying about its own problems</text>
  <text start="591.639" dur="4.411">and not me and they won&amp;#39;t be worrying</text>
  <text start="593.5" dur="4.47">about you know pushing war out into</text>
  <text start="596.05" dur="3.51">these areas but again they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="597.97" dur="3.299">protect themselves because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="599.56" dur="3.51">know what&amp;#39;s going to happen we see</text>
  <text start="601.269" dur="4.62">Russia they&amp;#39;ve tested their powerful</text>
  <text start="603.07" dur="5.1">ICBM capable of overcoming missile</text>
  <text start="605.889" dur="4.831">defense systems it is the rs.12 em</text>
  <text start="608.17" dur="4.979">topple in Turkana intercontinental</text>
  <text start="610.72" dur="4.229">ballistic missile and during the tests</text>
  <text start="613.149" dur="4.11">specialists obtain experimental data</text>
  <text start="614.949" dur="4.591">that will be used in the interest of</text>
  <text start="617.259" dur="4.231">developing effective means of overcoming</text>
  <text start="619.54" dur="4.469">anti-ballistic missile defense and</text>
  <text start="621.49" dur="5.19">equipping the prospective grouping of</text>
  <text start="624.009" dur="5.161">Russian ballistic missiles with them so</text>
  <text start="626.68" dur="7.079">they&amp;#39;re basically designing missiles</text>
  <text start="629.17" dur="6.93">that are going to avoid anything that we</text>
  <text start="633.759" dur="5.82">throw at them and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="636.1" dur="5.849">problem and again we know that our</text>
  <text start="639.579" dur="6.06">military realizes the Pentagon that</text>
  <text start="641.949" dur="6.33">Russia has the edge over our technology</text>
  <text start="645.639" dur="5.07">today that their systems work a lot</text>
  <text start="648.279" dur="5.401">better than what we have we see right</text>
  <text start="650.709" dur="6.031">now that Libya they&amp;#39;re gonna be holding</text>
  <text start="653.68" dur="5.31">elections in spring we understand the</text>
  <text start="656.74" dur="5.25">government of national Accord well they</text>
  <text start="658.99" dur="6.48">have expired it looks like half tar is</text>
  <text start="661.99" dur="6.959">getting ready to push elections in the</text>
  <text start="665.47" dur="7.739">country and we see right now that once</text>

  <text start="705.699" dur="4.051">to be using the dollar we see Syria&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="708.16" dur="3.57">looking to upgrade its air force with</text>
  <text start="709.75" dur="4.35">the Russian plane which is to make 29</text>
  <text start="711.73" dur="6.03">and they&amp;#39;re gonna modernize their Syrian</text>
  <text start="714.1" dur="6.37">forces right now we see the US base in</text>
  <text start="717.76" dur="5.56">Syria at humph</text>
  <text start="720.47" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s fully surrounded and blocked by the</text>
  <text start="723.32" dur="4.71">Syrian army I mean we&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="726.35" dur="4.29">whole situation right now and it is</text>
  <text start="728.03" dur="5.21">pretty much game over right now in Syria</text>
  <text start="730.64" dur="5.19">the Cabal has lost in this area and</text>
  <text start="733.24" dur="3.99">there&amp;#39;s really not much they can do it</text>
  <text start="735.83" dur="3.87">unless they have some type of an event</text>
  <text start="737.23" dur="4.48">waiting in the wings where they you know</text>
  <text start="739.7" dur="3.99">have some type of nuclear explosion and</text>
  <text start="741.71" dur="4.56">we still don&amp;#39;t know where that tactical</text>
  <text start="743.69" dur="5.52">nuke went where they smuggle that into a</text>
  <text start="746.27" dur="5.49">leper so once again they might be</text>
  <text start="749.21" dur="4.74">waiting to use that or they might just</text>
  <text start="751.76" dur="3.81">say forget it we&amp;#39;re done here which they</text>
  <text start="753.95" dur="3.51">never do so we&amp;#39;ll have to see what</text>
  <text start="755.57" dur="3.84">happens we see that Lavrov is out there</text>
  <text start="757.46" dur="4.1">saying that their mission their</text>
  <text start="759.41" dur="4.92">objective right now is to go after</text>
  <text start="761.56" dur="4.36">al-nusra they defeated the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="764.33" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re turning there&amp;#39;s their scopes</text>
  <text start="765.92" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re targeting on to Ana Lucia right</text>
  <text start="768.68" dur="4.41">now and going after that paid mercenary</text>
  <text start="770.9" dur="5.07">group and it looks like it&amp;#39;s pretty much</text>
  <text start="773.09" dur="4.98">done in Syria because right now the</text>
  <text start="775.97" dur="4.2">Cabal they&amp;#39;re paid mercenary army they</text>
  <text start="778.07" dur="4.53">are running we see Russia is going to</text>
  <text start="780.17" dur="6.78">establish two permanent bases in Syria</text>
  <text start="782.6" dur="6.9">and once again Russia and Syria they are</text>
  <text start="786.95" dur="4.92">working together in this area now with</text>
  <text start="789.5" dur="3.87">something very interesting just happen</text>
  <text start="791.87" dur="4.44">we know that Australia said listen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="793.37" dur="7.59">going to be moving our jets and we see</text>
  <text start="796.31" dur="7.46">right now the us-led coalition which has</text>
  <text start="800.96" dur="8.34">been conducting operations in Syria is</text>
  <text start="803.77" dur="10.84">going to conduct any up with the</text>
  <text start="809.3" dur="9.59">permission of Syria and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="814.61" dur="8.34">going to be flying into the Syrian areas</text>
  <text start="818.89" dur="9.82">controlled by Damascus this already</text>
  <text start="822.95" dur="9.24">tells you that the game is over because</text>
  <text start="828.71" dur="6.15">the whole point was to help the moderate</text>
  <text start="832.19" dur="5.43">rebels to help the paid mercenaries get</text>
  <text start="834.86" dur="5.61">into those government controlled areas</text>
  <text start="837.62" dur="5.28">now they won&amp;#39;t be flying or having any</text>
  <text start="840.47" dur="4.77">type of mission in these areas actually</text>
  <text start="842.9" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re going to ask permission of the</text>
  <text start="845.24" dur="6.12">Syrian government and we&amp;#39;ll have to wait</text>
  <text start="848.33" dur="6.1">to see how this goes the next phase of</text>
  <text start="851.36" dur="5.5">this is the US and the coalition</text>
  <text start="854.43" dur="4.14">is completely removing their forces and</text>
  <text start="856.86" dur="4.65">if they&amp;#39;re not gonna be flying missions</text>
  <text start="858.57" dur="4.71">into the government areas there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="861.51" dur="3.39">other place for them to fly anymore</text>
  <text start="863.28" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s no other place for them to have</text>
  <text start="864.9" dur="5.97">these missions which means they are not</text>
  <text start="867.45" dur="4.92">needed in this area and they need to</text>
  <text start="870.87" dur="4.14">remove themselves and I think this is</text>
  <text start="872.37" dur="4.41">what Syria Russia they&amp;#39;re gonna play</text>
  <text start="875.01" dur="4.86">this up and they&amp;#39;re gonna bring it to</text>
  <text start="876.78" dur="4.89">the UN and again the United States under</text>
  <text start="879.87" dur="4.14">international law they can&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="881.67" dur="4.86">anything they&amp;#39;re in a country which they</text>
  <text start="884.01" dur="4.35">were never invited they can&amp;#39;t stay there</text>
  <text start="886.53" dur="3.48">because they can&amp;#39;t think of any legal</text>
  <text start="888.36" dur="3.33">reason why they need to stay there and</text>
  <text start="890.01" dur="5.37">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen as we</text>
  <text start="891.69" dur="7.68">can see their whole entire mission of</text>
  <text start="895.38" dur="6.86">splitting up Syria making a separate</text>
  <text start="899.37" dur="7.02">Kurd area it&amp;#39;s all falling apart and</text>
  <text start="902.24" dur="7.24">again just because we fired missiles</text>
  <text start="906.39" dur="6.6">into a deserted base because Putin was</text>
  <text start="909.48" dur="4.65">warned Assad was warned they evacuated</text>
  <text start="912.99" dur="3.66">the base the base was up and running</text>
  <text start="914.13" dur="5.28">within an hour everyone thought we were</text>
  <text start="916.65" dur="4.98">going to war look what has happened in</text>
  <text start="919.41" dur="4.56">this area we&amp;#39;re starting to see this in</text>
  <text start="921.63" dur="4.89">Afghanistan where the Pentagon right now</text>
  <text start="923.97" dur="5.94">is actually going after the paid</text>
  <text start="926.52" dur="5.37">mercenary army which is the Islamic</text>
  <text start="929.91" dur="4.17">state because this is where the a lot of</text>
  <text start="931.89" dur="4.11">the the Islamic state this is where they</text>
  <text start="934.08" dur="4.08">they were brought they were brought into</text>
  <text start="936" dur="4.86">Afghanistan they were brought into Libya</text>
  <text start="938.16" dur="5.01">we also see the poppy fields they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="940.86" dur="4.5">trying to get rid of the poppy fields</text>
  <text start="943.17" dur="4.59">that are controlled by the intelligence</text>
  <text start="945.36" dur="5.52">agencies so we see all this happening</text>
  <text start="947.76" dur="4.65">and North Korea that is a lost cause it</text>
  <text start="950.88" dur="4.35">looks like South Korea right now is</text>
  <text start="952.41" dur="6.84">gonna have talks with North Korea in</text>
  <text start="955.23" dur="6.23">2018 and once again unless there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="959.25" dur="4.35">type of an event which there could be in</text>
  <text start="961.46" dur="3.55">Ukraine that could be won there that</text>
  <text start="963.6" dur="3.24">could be won in North Korea they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="965.01" dur="2.19">gonna try to do whatever they possibly</text>
  <text start="966.84" dur="2.13">can</text>
  <text start="967.2" dur="4.02">to get something off the ground because</text>
  <text start="968.97" dur="4.23">time is running out look what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="971.22" dur="5.13">happening here the executive order was</text>
  <text start="973.2" dur="4.83">created all these investigations are</text>
  <text start="976.35" dur="4.89">going on about the uranium one deal</text>
  <text start="978.03" dur="4.98">about the Trump dossier about Russian</text>
  <text start="981.24" dur="4.29">collusion all if it&amp;#39;s falling apart and</text>
  <text start="983.01" dur="4.39">now there&amp;#39;s investigations going on with</text>
  <text start="985.53" dur="4.72">Comey McCabe</text>
  <text start="987.4" dur="3.96">and the rest the truth is continually</text>
  <text start="990.25" dur="2.91">coming out even though the corporate</text>
  <text start="991.36" dur="5.04">media is not really reporting on a lot</text>
  <text start="993.16" dur="6.51">of it soon they&amp;#39;re gonna have no choice</text>
  <text start="996.4" dur="5.88">and when formal investigations start to</text>
  <text start="999.67" dur="4.38">happen when things really start to fall</text>
  <text start="1002.28" dur="5.37">apart in the Middle East where they have</text>
  <text start="1004.05" dur="6.06">no choice where they can&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="1007.65" dur="4.26">out there anymore you&amp;#39;re gonna see them</text>
  <text start="1010.11" dur="4.53">react and this is the part where we have</text>
  <text start="1011.91" dur="7.95">to be very nervous because when you push</text>
  <text start="1014.64" dur="7.35">or corner a wild animal into a position</text>
  <text start="1019.86" dur="4.29">where they have no other place to go</text>
  <text start="1021.99" dur="3.599">they&amp;#39;re gonna come out with their claws</text>
  <text start="1024.15" dur="2.82">and they&amp;#39;re gonna do whatever they</text>
  <text start="1025.589" dur="4.171">possibly can to get out of that</text>
  <text start="1026.97" dur="5.34">situation and this is just like the</text>
  <text start="1029.76" dur="5.97">neocons it&amp;#39;s just like the Cabal the</text>
  <text start="1032.31" dur="5.46">elite they&amp;#39;re pushed into a corner there</text>
  <text start="1035.73" dur="4.77">are crazy animal they&amp;#39;re gonna come out</text>
  <text start="1037.77" dur="5.76">with their claws and they use events</text>
  <text start="1040.5" dur="5.58">they use distraction they use anything</text>
  <text start="1043.53" dur="5.07">they possibly can to divert everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1046.08" dur="5.76">attention onto something else and</text>
  <text start="1048.6" dur="6">hopefully get us into a war hopefully</text>
  <text start="1051.84" dur="4.23">take control again this would be their</text>
  <text start="1054.6" dur="4.5">plan this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="1056.07" dur="4.65">and this is their goal all the time now</text>
