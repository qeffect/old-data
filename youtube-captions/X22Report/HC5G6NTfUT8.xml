  <text start="92.72" dur="7.53">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="95.57" dur="6.63">today the job numbers came out and the</text>
  <text start="100.25" dur="5.19">US government central bankers they are</text>
  <text start="102.2" dur="7.13">pushing the manipulation right to the</text>
  <text start="105.44" dur="9.36">edge here because they need to prove and</text>
  <text start="109.33" dur="9.51">show the world that the economy the US</text>
  <text start="114.8" dur="6.75">economy is completely recovered and</text>
  <text start="118.84" dur="4.63">we&amp;#39;re starting to see that no matter</text>
  <text start="121.55" dur="6.81">what they do we know they&amp;#39;re manipulated</text>
  <text start="123.47" dur="11.58">at this point now over 80% of the jobs</text>
  <text start="128.36" dur="11.58">that were created they were minimum wage</text>
  <text start="135.05" dur="7.799">earners in January so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="139.94" dur="5.34">right now is we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot more</text>
  <text start="142.849" dur="5.461">waiters we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot more</text>
  <text start="145.28" dur="7.679">bartenders and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="148.31" dur="6.92">convince us that retail is adding more</text>
  <text start="152.959" dur="5.011">people well that&amp;#39;s kind of strange</text>
  <text start="155.23" dur="5.53">because what have we been seeing we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="157.97" dur="5.75">been seeing retail stores announcing</text>
  <text start="160.76" dur="5.45">layoffs closures</text>
  <text start="163.72" dur="5.87">since the holiday season and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="166.21" dur="6.75">trying to convince us that we&amp;#39;ve added</text>
  <text start="169.59" dur="5.65">more and more people to the retail area</text>
  <text start="172.96" dur="3.87">now of course this makes no sense</text>
  <text start="175.24" dur="4.77">whatsoever</text>
  <text start="176.83" dur="5.61">we know that retail has been contracting</text>
  <text start="180.01" dur="4.86">we know since the holiday season stores</text>
  <text start="182.44" dur="3.08">have been closing people have been laid</text>
  <text start="184.87" dur="4.71">off</text>
  <text start="185.52" dur="5.59">we know that Sports Authority has</text>
  <text start="189.58" dur="4.32">declared bankruptcy they&amp;#39;re closing a</text>
  <text start="191.11" dur="6.39">lot of stores and if we go back in time</text>
  <text start="193.9" dur="9.09">we see all the store closures Barnes &amp;amp;</text>
  <text start="197.5" dur="7.98">Noble Best Buy and many others</text>
  <text start="202.99" dur="5.69">so these retail numbers make no sense</text>
  <text start="205.48" dur="6.6">because during this period of time</text>
  <text start="208.68" dur="6.93">stores remove their workers after the</text>
  <text start="212.08" dur="6.05">holiday season and we saw from the last</text>
  <text start="215.61" dur="5.32">employment numbers that came out all</text>
  <text start="218.13" dur="6.85">this completely didn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="220.93" dur="7.68">because retail is contracting and that</text>
  <text start="224.98" dur="5.97">was proven and we see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="228.61" dur="5.04">telling us that education and health</text>
  <text start="230.95" dur="5.42">they added 86,000 jobs retail added</text>
  <text start="233.65" dur="6.69">55,000 jobs leisure and hospitality</text>
  <text start="236.37" dur="6.13">added 48,000 jobs so what about the</text>
  <text start="240.34" dur="5.13">well-paying jobs like finance trucking</text>
  <text start="242.5" dur="7.73">manufacturing or mining well finance</text>
  <text start="245.47" dur="7.41">added six thousand jobs trucking lost</text>
  <text start="250.23" dur="6.42">5,000 jobs now we talked about trucking</text>
  <text start="252.88" dur="8.24">before and we know that the deliveries</text>
  <text start="256.65" dur="8.98">they&amp;#39;ve gone down manufacturing down</text>
  <text start="261.12" dur="10.69">16,000 jobs mining down 18,000 jobs a</text>
  <text start="265.63" dur="10.68">net loss of 33,000 jobs so in this past</text>
  <text start="271.81" dur="9.65">year the US has added 360,000 waiters</text>
  <text start="276.31" dur="10.5">and only 12,000 manufacturing workers</text>
  <text start="281.46" dur="9.85">that&amp;#39;s it and if you look you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="286.81" dur="6.96">that since 2007 we have gained 1.6</text>
  <text start="291.31" dur="3.63">million waiters and bartenders and I</text>
  <text start="293.77" dur="3.99">have nothing against waiters and</text>
  <text start="294.94" dur="5.64">bartenders and we&amp;#39;ve lost</text>
  <text start="297.76" dur="7.26">point four million manufacturing jobs</text>
  <text start="300.58" dur="7.53">and manufacturing is declining now how</text>
  <text start="305.02" dur="5.64">do we add these manufacturing jobs when</text>
  <text start="308.11" dur="4.62">manufacturing is a complete disaster and</text>
  <text start="310.66" dur="4.95">we know a lot of manufacturers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="312.73" dur="7.19">laying off people well began it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="315.61" dur="11.03">completely manipulated and we see wages</text>
  <text start="319.92" dur="10.9">wages have dropped so this whole entire</text>
  <text start="326.64" dur="7.18">scenario of their employment numbers</text>
  <text start="330.82" dur="4.43">makes no sense because we have to</text>
  <text start="333.82" dur="5.19">remember how all this has figured out</text>
  <text start="335.25" dur="5.59">those people who are currently looking</text>
  <text start="339.01" dur="3.63">for a job but have not been on an</text>
  <text start="340.84" dur="4.41">interview in the last four weeks</text>
  <text start="342.64" dur="5.37">you&amp;#39;re just not counted even though you</text>
  <text start="345.25" dur="4.77">still want a job even though you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="348.01" dur="4.95">still setting out a resume you are not</text>
  <text start="350.02" dur="4.8">counted if you have a part-time job</text>
  <text start="352.96" dur="3.81">you&amp;#39;re counted as a full-time worker if</text>
  <text start="354.82" dur="4.83">you have two part-time jobs it&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="356.77" dur="5.07">full-time jobs but if you get laid off</text>
  <text start="359.65" dur="4.23">from these part-time jobs and you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="361.84" dur="3.78">working at least 25 to 30 hours it all</text>
  <text start="363.88" dur="4.91">depends on each state that&amp;#39;s different</text>
  <text start="365.62" dur="6.24">and earning a certain number of dollars</text>
  <text start="368.79" dur="6.58">you&amp;#39;re not counted as laid off so all</text>
  <text start="371.86" dur="6.21">these retail individuals can be laid off</text>
  <text start="375.37" dur="4.23">and if they&amp;#39;re working under a certain</text>
  <text start="378.07" dur="4.92">number of hours they&amp;#39;re just not counted</text>
  <text start="379.6" dur="7.23">but they were counted as being employed</text>
  <text start="382.99" dur="7.62">and full-time so basically we have all</text>
  <text start="386.83" dur="7.05">these people that want jobs who&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="390.61" dur="5.13">looking for jobs but they&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="393.88" dur="4.26">counted anymore and these are the people</text>
  <text start="395.74" dur="6.57">they count as fallen off so the whole</text>
  <text start="398.14" dur="6.42">thing is completely manipulated to make</text>
  <text start="402.31" dur="8.16">everyone believe that we are in this</text>
  <text start="404.56" dur="7.95">incredible recovery and we&amp;#39;re not we</text>
  <text start="410.47" dur="5.13">know we&amp;#39;re not because the US government</text>
  <text start="412.51" dur="6.33">central bankers they are continually out</text>
  <text start="415.6" dur="6.21">there trying to convince everyone that</text>
  <text start="418.84" dur="5.46">the economy is fine when the economy is</text>
  <text start="421.81" dur="5.7">truly fine you don&amp;#39;t have to convince</text>
  <text start="424.3" dur="5.19">the masses they already know they</text>
  <text start="427.51" dur="4.05">already know because they feel good they</text>
  <text start="429.49" dur="4.17">have a strong income come</text>
  <text start="431.56" dur="4.47">and they have discretionary funds they</text>
  <text start="433.66" dur="4.5">can go out and spend they&amp;#39;ll go out and</text>
  <text start="436.03" dur="4.32">purchase a house mortgage departments</text>
  <text start="438.16" dur="4.71">will expand retail will expand you see</text>
  <text start="440.35" dur="5.31">more stores opening up you&amp;#39;ll see more</text>
  <text start="442.87" dur="4.74">people being hired we&amp;#39;re not seeing this</text>
  <text start="445.66" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;re seeing the opposite we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="447.61" dur="6.36">contraction and if people are purchasing</text>
  <text start="450.91" dur="6.3">more goods manufacturing factories</text>
  <text start="453.97" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re producing the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="457.21" dur="4.89">should be around 1100 1200 at this point</text>
  <text start="459.76" dur="4.94">we&amp;#39;re not seeing any of this we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="462.1" dur="8.43">seeing the opposite of what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="464.7" dur="7.87">now to boost this entire recovery what</text>
  <text start="470.53" dur="4.5">did they have to do they had to create</text>
  <text start="472.57" dur="4.59">bubbles central bank bubbles to make</text>
  <text start="475.03" dur="5.55">everyone believe that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="477.16" dur="7.86">so they push the idea since 2008 that</text>
  <text start="480.58" dur="5.79">everyone should go back to school take</text>
  <text start="485.02" dur="3.51">out student loans as many as you</text>
  <text start="486.37" dur="5.43">possibly can put yourself into debt</text>
  <text start="488.53" dur="6.54">because that makes us more money go out</text>
  <text start="491.8" dur="5.94">and buy a car that&amp;#39;s why Obama had the</text>
  <text start="495.07" dur="5.55">cash for clunkers that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="497.74" dur="4.98">continually lowering the standards of</text>
  <text start="500.62" dur="4.919">getting an automobile because they</text>
  <text start="502.72" dur="6.84">needed the car loans and the student</text>
  <text start="505.539" dur="8.101">loans to bubble up and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="509.56" dur="6.75">what happened during this period we have</text>
  <text start="513.64" dur="5.6">seen the auto loan industry and the</text>
  <text start="516.31" dur="5.49">student loan industry skyrocket and</text>
  <text start="519.24" dur="6.31">they&amp;#39;re both in the trillions of dollars</text>
  <text start="521.8" dur="5.46">and more and more people are in debt but</text>
  <text start="525.55" dur="5.13">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a lot of</text>
  <text start="527.26" dur="6.72">people they are delinquent on their</text>
  <text start="530.68" dur="6.9">payments and that rate is rising right</text>
  <text start="533.98" dur="7.32">now and it&amp;#39;s getting worse as time goes</text>
  <text start="537.58" dur="8.009">on we see Blackrock they decided to</text>
  <text start="541.3" dur="8.7">spend ETF issuance due to a surge in</text>
  <text start="545.589" dur="6.711">demand for gold black Rock says issuance</text>
  <text start="550" dur="4.73">of gold trust shares has been suspended</text>
  <text start="552.3" dur="7.09">why because there are too many people</text>
  <text start="554.73" dur="6.21">demanding gold this is a situation that</text>
  <text start="559.39" dur="3.51">everyone should be looking at this point</text>
  <text start="560.94" dur="3.45">because we just mentioned this in the</text>
  <text start="562.9" dur="5.15">previous report</text>
  <text start="564.39" dur="6.569">when we see gold spike by not $20 not</text>
  <text start="568.05" dur="6.57">$30 by like a hundred a hundred and</text>
  <text start="570.959" dur="5.94">fifty at the close of business of the</text>
  <text start="574.62" dur="4.38">same day and it reaches a hundred one</text>
  <text start="576.899" dur="4.801">hundred fifty dollars and the next day</text>
  <text start="579" dur="6.87">or the day after we see it suppressed by</text>
  <text start="581.7" dur="6.09">thirty forty fifty dollars we know this</text>
  <text start="585.87" dur="4.589">is the signal that something&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="587.79" dur="4.47">and then a couple days later we see gold</text>
  <text start="590.459" dur="3.75">surged again by a hundred one hundred</text>
  <text start="592.26" dur="4.41">fifty dollars and we see them suppress</text>
  <text start="594.209" dur="4.861">it by thirty forty fifty dollars if you</text>
  <text start="596.67" dur="5.28">notice they&amp;#39;re losing control and gold</text>
  <text start="599.07" dur="4.56">is continually rising this is something</text>
  <text start="601.95" dur="3.54">that we need to look at this is</text>
  <text start="603.63" dur="3.899">something that will tell us that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="605.49" dur="4.289">losing control and when people see this</text>
  <text start="607.529" dur="3.901">occurring people are gonna say okay wait</text>
  <text start="609.779" dur="3.781">a minute gold is surging right now why</text>
  <text start="611.43" dur="5.13">is this I better get in maybe I should</text>
  <text start="613.56" dur="5.73">sell my stocks maybe I should protect</text>
  <text start="616.56" dur="4.23">myself because at the same time most</text>
  <text start="619.29" dur="4.289">likely we&amp;#39;re gonna see the stock market</text>
  <text start="620.79" dur="4.65">start to fall apart and of course we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="623.579" dur="4.161">gonna see manipulation all over the</text>
  <text start="625.44" dur="7.259">place but they&amp;#39;re going to lose control</text>
  <text start="627.74" dur="7.42">so we see right now the Comex has less</text>
  <text start="632.699" dur="5.851">than 74 thousand ounces registered there</text>
  <text start="635.16" dur="5.82">and basically they won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="638.55" dur="4.64">handle deliveries once the claims are</text>
  <text start="640.98" dur="4.349">put in so we&amp;#39;re gonna see things</text>
  <text start="643.19" dur="3.88">completely fall apart and once we see</text>
  <text start="645.329" dur="6.421">that things are just gonna get out of</text>
  <text start="647.07" dur="7.11">hand now the dry bulk shippers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="651.75" dur="6.87">saying it is so bad and this is coming</text>
  <text start="654.18" dur="7.05">from a CEO from a droll dry bulk shipper</text>
  <text start="658.62" dur="5.85">saying saying that they have an an</text>
  <text start="661.23" dur="5.76">enormous of oversupply of vessels and it</text>
  <text start="664.47" dur="3.78">cannot be sustained and of course these</text>
  <text start="666.99" dur="3.27">were all built during the good times</text>
  <text start="668.25" dur="3.36">when everything was great and they</text>
  <text start="670.26" dur="3.54">needed more and more these vessels we</text>
  <text start="671.61" dur="4.08">know China is going to be releasing more</text>
  <text start="673.8" dur="5.43">of these because they were you know in</text>
  <text start="675.69" dur="5.43">the building phase of this but what</text>
  <text start="679.23" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;re seeing is everything falling apart</text>
  <text start="681.12" dur="6.42">the Baltic Dry Index manufacturing and</text>
  <text start="683.37" dur="6.54">the moving of dry bulk goods and what</text>
  <text start="687.54" dur="4.35">we&amp;#39;re seeing at this point is everything</text>
  <text start="689.91" dur="4.77">contracting this is why we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="691.89" dur="4.59">all of these ships at this time and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="694.68" dur="3.3">warning that in the coming months</text>
  <text start="696.48" dur="5.7">there&amp;#39;ll be a lot of bankrupt</text>
  <text start="697.98" dur="5.79">sieze counterparty risk and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="702.18" dur="4.41">to be a complete nightmare he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="703.77" dur="5.25">that we haven&amp;#39;t seen this since the</text>
  <text start="706.59" dur="5.88">Viking Age he said this is not</text>
  <text start="709.02" dur="8.28">sustainable for anybody and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="712.47" dur="8.16">to lead to dramatic changes now the</text>
  <text start="717.3" dur="6.66">German banks they were told to start</text>
