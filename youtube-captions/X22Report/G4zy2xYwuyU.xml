  <text start="290.93" dur="5.07">small tiny payments and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="293.72" dur="4.56">to see a lot of individuals well they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="332.99" dur="7.59">what happened later on in August</text>
  <text start="337.37" dur="6.24">well the orders have disappeared and</text>
  <text start="340.58" dur="4.95">durable goods have declined right now</text>
  <text start="343.61" dur="3.63">and durable goods are like those big</text>
  <text start="345.53" dur="3.39">ticket items like you know washers</text>
  <text start="347.24" dur="3.9">dryers and those types of things and</text>
  <text start="348.92" dur="4.23">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is they</text>
  <text start="351.14" dur="4.62">continually try to push these things up</text>
  <text start="353.15" dur="5.37">to make it look like the economy is</text>
  <text start="355.76" dur="6.06">doing well and we understand that the</text>
  <text start="358.52" dur="5.43">economy is not doing well whatsoever now</text>
  <text start="361.82" dur="4.82">we know that the central banks they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="363.95" dur="4.98">been creating currency like crazy and</text>
  <text start="366.64" dur="4.3">the Financial Times recently ran an</text>
  <text start="368.93" dur="4.23">article that states the leading central</text>
  <text start="370.94" dur="5.55">banks now own a fifth of the</text>
  <text start="373.16" dur="5.43">government&amp;#39;s total debt now these</text>
  <text start="376.49" dur="5.28">figures they are just unbelievable</text>
  <text start="378.59" dur="4.98">without any recession or crisis major</text>
  <text start="381.77" dur="4.08">central banks are purchasing more than</text>
  <text start="383.57" dur="4.89">200 billion a month in government and</text>
  <text start="385.85" dur="4.53">private debt led by the ECB the Bank of</text>

  <text start="421.07" dur="4.59">percent of UK&amp;#39;s sovereign debt and a</text>
  <text start="423.89" dur="5.4">recent report by Nick Smith an analyst</text>
  <text start="425.66" dur="5.22">at sea LSA warns that he calls what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="429.29" dur="3.629">saying out there is that he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="430.88" dur="5.25">that this is the nationalization of the</text>
  <text start="432.919" dur="6.091">secondary market now that we know the</text>
  <text start="436.13" dur="6.93">central banks they have been monetizing</text>
  <text start="439.01" dur="6.51">and monetization is a perfect system to</text>
  <text start="443.06" dur="5.039">nationalize the economy passing all the</text>
  <text start="445.52" dur="6.16">risks of excess spending and imbalances</text>
  <text start="448.099" dur="6.701">to taxpayers and it always ends</text>
  <text start="451.68" dur="6.87">badly because two plus two does not</text>
  <text start="454.8" dur="6.33">equal twenty-two and we can see right</text>
  <text start="458.55" dur="4.14">now this is what&amp;#39;s been happening here</text>
  <text start="461.13" dur="3.3">in this country this is what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="462.69" dur="5.19">happening in Europe this is what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="464.43" dur="5.609">happening in Japan and this time it is</text>
  <text start="467.88" dur="4.67">not different I know they keep saying</text>
  <text start="470.039" dur="5.401">believe me this time it&amp;#39;s different and</text>
  <text start="472.55" dur="6.55">everything&amp;#39;s going to be okay no</text>
  <text start="475.44" dur="7.65">actually it&amp;#39;s a lot worse because over</text>
  <text start="479.1" dur="7.319">time since 2008 we&amp;#39;ve put on so much</text>
  <text start="483.09" dur="5.07">debt we pump so much free money into the</text>
  <text start="486.419" dur="3.961">system actually didn&amp;#39;t reach the people</text>
  <text start="488.16" dur="4.319">it reached the banking system it reached</text>
  <text start="490.38" dur="4.8">the stock market it reached the housing</text>
  <text start="492.479" dur="4.831">market it reached everywhere else except</text>
  <text start="495.18" dur="5.18">into the people&amp;#39;s hands and this is why</text>
  <text start="497.31" dur="5.34">you see inflation in all of these areas</text>
  <text start="500.36" dur="3.91">now of course</text>
  <text start="502.65" dur="3.72">governments can print all the money they</text>
  <text start="504.27" dur="3.6">want we know manoosh n&amp;#39; is already out</text>
  <text start="506.37" dur="3.45">there saying that listen we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="507.87" dur="3.24">raise the debt ceiling so don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="509.82" dur="3.45">about it well we already know that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="511.11" dur="3.75">fact there&amp;#39;s no way that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="513.27" dur="4.28">going to raise it because if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="514.86" dur="6.809">raise it the country&amp;#39;s in big trouble</text>
  <text start="517.55" dur="6.159">they need to continually - they need to</text>
  <text start="521.669" dur="3.931">continually borrow money if they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="523.709" dur="5">borrow any more money the government</text>
  <text start="525.6" dur="5.85">doesn&amp;#39;t take enough in to pay its bills</text>
  <text start="528.709" dur="5.38">think of a household where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="531.45" dur="4.92">making $50,000 a year they have their</text>
  <text start="534.089" dur="4.051">car payment they have their mortgage and</text>
  <text start="536.37" dur="2.909">they have credit cards of say a hundred</text>
  <text start="538.14" dur="3.9">and fifty or two hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="539.279" dur="5.31">dollars or whatever and you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="542.04" dur="4.68">getting any type of raise you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="544.589" dur="5.25">getting the cost of living inflation</text>
  <text start="546.72" dur="5.01">raised that you normally get but the</text>
  <text start="549.839" dur="4.201">debt is continually being added on and</text>
  <text start="551.73" dur="5.099">what happens is with whatever the credit</text>
  <text start="554.04" dur="4.59">card our interest rate is 28 30 percent</text>
  <text start="556.829" dur="4.2">or maybe even 15 percent we&amp;#39;ll go with</text>
  <text start="558.63" dur="3.449">that you can&amp;#39;t even make the interest</text>
  <text start="561.029" dur="4.171">payments actually you can&amp;#39;t even put a</text>
  <text start="562.079" dur="5.76">dent in the debt and you need to live</text>
  <text start="565.2" dur="4.29">and the cost of things keep going up you</text>
  <text start="567.839" dur="4.531">borrow a little bit more on credit cards</text>
  <text start="569.49" dur="5.219">and guess what happens your salary isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="572.37" dur="4.05">moving so you&amp;#39;re not taking in enough to</text>
  <text start="574.709" dur="3.151">pay for all this debt this is going to</text>
  <text start="576.42" dur="4.73">be this is what&amp;#39;s going to happen with</text>
  <text start="577.86" dur="6.12">the government if they don&amp;#39;t borrow more</text>
  <text start="581.15" dur="4.179">the tax revenue coming in from tax</text>
  <text start="583.98" dur="5.099">receipts</text>
  <text start="585.329" dur="6.69">is not enough to pay for everything that</text>
  <text start="589.079" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;ve created and you know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="592.019" dur="4.86">going to happen and this is why they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="593.879" dur="4.68">never stop raising the debt ceiling it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="596.879" dur="5.19">kind of a waste of time to even have</text>
  <text start="598.559" dur="7.68">this argument now what we&amp;#39;re seeing here</text>
  <text start="602.069" dur="8.19">is that this entire system the way the</text>
  <text start="606.239" dur="5.13">central bank&amp;#39;s set it up it&amp;#39;s a no-win</text>
  <text start="610.259" dur="4.68">situation</text>
  <text start="611.369" dur="6.84">there&amp;#39;s no way out of this except for a</text>
  <text start="614.939" dur="6.15">bankruptcy which is a default to clear</text>
  <text start="618.209" dur="4.59">up the debt and if you look at Europe if</text>
  <text start="621.089" dur="3.571">you look at the United States if you</text>
  <text start="622.799" dur="4.5">look at Japan and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="624.66" dur="8.459">countries we&amp;#39;re in a huge amount of debt</text>
  <text start="627.299" dur="8.04">and this is completely unsustainable it</text>
  <text start="633.119" dur="4.44">will not be able to be sustainable we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="635.339" dur="5.91">gonna hit that point where all of a</text>
