  <text start="45.78" dur="5.489">part-time jobs let&amp;#39;s get right into the</text>
  <text start="48.69" dur="4.98">economic collapse financial news now we</text>
  <text start="51.269" dur="4.231">see when we look around the world we</text>
  <text start="53.67" dur="3.68">look in the United States we look in</text>
  <text start="55.5" dur="4.949">Canada we look in Australia UK</text>
  <text start="57.35" dur="5.949">throughout Europe we see that the</text>
  <text start="60.449" dur="5.67">economies of these countries they are</text>
  <text start="63.299" dur="5.82">contracting we see bubbles are starting</text>
  <text start="66.119" dur="6.331">to pop we see bubbles in real estate we</text>
  <text start="69.119" dur="5.79">see it in the auto industry and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="72.45" dur="4.65">starting to see that people are losing</text>
  <text start="74.909" dur="4.32">their jobs now remember a lot of these</text>
  <text start="77.1" dur="4.71">countries have a huge amount of debt</text>
  <text start="79.229" dur="4.561">especially throughout Europe and out in</text>
  <text start="81.81" dur="5.16">the UK we see retail sales they have</text>
  <text start="83.79" dur="5.369">slowed in February not a very good sign</text>
  <text start="86.97" dur="4.89">here in the United States we see the</text>
  <text start="89.159" dur="6.211">fiscal year for retailer for retailers</text>
  <text start="91.86" dur="5.76">that ended in january it was nothing</text>
  <text start="95.37" dur="4.289">that they thought it was going to be</text>
  <text start="97.62" dur="3.75">they thought that people were going to</text>
  <text start="99.659" dur="3.991">come out during the holiday season and</text>
  <text start="101.37" dur="6.02">just spend like crazy and follow this</text>
  <text start="103.65" dur="7.05">into January well that didn&amp;#39;t work out</text>
  <text start="107.39" dur="7.36">Thompson Reuters same-store sales the</text>
  <text start="110.7" dur="6.48">index reported in February indicates a</text>
  <text start="114.75" dur="5.07">very small gain a point five percent now</text>
  <text start="117.18" dur="7.14">if we look at that number and we strip</text>
  <text start="119.82" dur="7.74">out the drugstore sector of this we see</text>
  <text start="124.32" dur="6.839">the same store sales that actually fell</text>
  <text start="127.56" dur="6">by 0.3% so if you look at drugs this is</text>
  <text start="131.159" dur="4.261">something that people need if they have</text>
  <text start="133.56" dur="6.84">some type of ailment or something like</text>
  <text start="135.42" dur="6.179">that you see that everything is not what</text>
  <text start="140.4" dur="4.229">they thought it was going to be they</text>
  <text start="141.599" dur="4.771">actually thought that retail sales was</text>
  <text start="144.629" dur="4.86">going to increase during this period now</text>
  <text start="146.37" dur="8.55">a three percent increase is considered a</text>
  <text start="149.489" dur="7.021">sign of robust retail economy and of</text>
  <text start="154.92" dur="5.609">course we know there&amp;#39;s a lot of stores</text>
  <text start="156.51" dur="7.95">like Macy&amp;#39;s sears JC Penney sports</text>
  <text start="160.529" dur="6.061">authority finish line and many others</text>
  <text start="164.46" dur="4.55">that are closing their stores revenues</text>
  <text start="166.59" dur="5.69">are down they didn&amp;#39;t make the sales and</text>
  <text start="169.01" dur="8.68">right now retailers are stuck in a</text>
  <text start="172.28" dur="7.5">contraction and basically there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="177.69" dur="5.04">nothing for them to do at this point and</text>
  <text start="179.78" dur="5.47">as time goes on as we move through the</text>
  <text start="182.73" dur="4.2">spring going into the summer this</text>
  <text start="185.25" dur="4.86">situation is going to get worse because</text>
  <text start="186.93" dur="5.37">as we know this time period for</text>
  <text start="190.11" dur="5.07">retailers is one of the hardest time</text>
  <text start="192.3" dur="6.6">periods for them to survive we just came</text>
  <text start="195.18" dur="7.8">out of the good time and now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="198.9" dur="8.94">seeing the opposite so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="202.98" dur="7.7">is in February same-store sales declined</text>
  <text start="207.84" dur="9.75">in January they declined by 1.1 percent</text>
  <text start="210.68" dur="10.87">so as of februari March of 2015 we have</text>
  <text start="217.59" dur="7.28">been on a trend that is downward which</text>
  <text start="221.55" dur="5.7">is contracting it&amp;#39;s not getting better</text>
  <text start="224.87" dur="4.72">the Census Bureau&amp;#39;s version of the</text>
  <text start="227.25" dur="5.91">overall retail sales they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="229.59" dur="5.13">there&amp;#39;s a clear consumer problem with</text>
  <text start="233.16" dur="5.16">implications spread across the US</text>
  <text start="234.72" dur="6.51">economy there is no spending growth they</text>
  <text start="238.32" dur="6.59">said and that tells you something that</text>
  <text start="241.23" dur="6.54">tells you that the everyday person</text>
  <text start="244.91" dur="6.76">they&amp;#39;re nervous they&amp;#39;re afraid they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="247.77" dur="8.55">not in the full-time high-paying jobs</text>
  <text start="251.67" dur="6.87">they have part-time work and it&amp;#39;s making</text>
  <text start="256.32" dur="3.24">it very difficult for them to get by now</text>
  <text start="258.54" dur="3.96">especially those people that are getting</text>
  <text start="259.56" dur="6.41">laid off and they have these bills that</text>
  <text start="262.5" dur="6.54">they have to pay they just can&amp;#39;t get by</text>
  <text start="265.97" dur="5.83">with the salary or maybe they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="269.04" dur="4.2">a salary coming in anymore and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="271.8" dur="2.91">making it very difficult so this way</text>
  <text start="273.24" dur="4.23">they don&amp;#39;t have any discretionary funds</text>
  <text start="274.71" dur="4.02">so we&amp;#39;re not seeing the spending that</text>
  <text start="277.47" dur="3.51">everyone thinks there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="278.73" dur="4.13">because we have a problem in this</text>
  <text start="280.98" dur="4.74">economy that&amp;#39;s what it boils down to</text>
  <text start="282.86" dur="4.84">people can explain away all different</text>
  <text start="285.72" dur="4.35">things of why the economy is not doing</text>
  <text start="287.7" dur="5.1">well why people aren&amp;#39;t spending but it</text>
  <text start="290.07" dur="5.16">comes down to the basics if you have a</text>
  <text start="292.8" dur="5.02">job a high-paying job and you feel</text>
  <text start="295.23" dur="6.43">comfortable and secure you</text>
  <text start="297.82" dur="5.43">go out and spend if you&amp;#39;re nervous in a</text>
  <text start="301.66" dur="2.97">job and you see people getting laid off</text>
  <text start="303.25" dur="3.54">if you got laid off yourself and you</text>
  <text start="304.63" dur="4.92">can&amp;#39;t find a job if you got laid off and</text>
  <text start="306.79" dur="7.1">you found a part-time job you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="309.55" dur="7.74">going to spend and the stores the online</text>
  <text start="313.89" dur="8.32">sales are going to suffer and this is</text>
  <text start="317.29" dur="8.13">what we are seeing now we see the auto</text>
  <text start="322.21" dur="5.85">industry this is a complete gigantic</text>
  <text start="325.42" dur="6.15">bubble it&amp;#39;s been inflated by the</text>
  <text start="328.06" dur="7.56">subprime lender who came in has no</text>
  <text start="331.57" dur="6.33">credit purchased the car and we see at</text>
  <text start="335.62" dur="4.05">this point that the situation is getting</text>
  <text start="337.9" dur="5.7">worse because delinquencies are riding</text>
  <text start="339.67" dur="7.47">rising defaults are rising and we see</text>
  <text start="343.6" dur="5.9">that a third of the over 1 million cars</text>
  <text start="347.14" dur="5.45">and light trucks sold during the month</text>
  <text start="349.5" dur="7.09">releases this is according to JD Power</text>
  <text start="352.59" dur="6.57">since 2009 the share of monthly auto</text>
  <text start="356.59" dur="6.93">leases as a percentage of vehicle sales</text>
  <text start="359.16" dur="8.11">tripled about 3.1 million vehicles will</text>
  <text start="363.52" dur="6.51">return to dealer lots off Lisa&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="367.27" dur="5.61">year up twenty percent from 2015 and the</text>
  <text start="370.03" dur="5.73">number will climb to 3.6 million in 2017</text>
  <text start="372.88" dur="6.72">and 4 million in 2018 so what does this</text>
  <text start="375.76" dur="6.29">mean for dealers deflation and what does</text>
  <text start="379.6" dur="6.42">that mean for the automaker&amp;#39;s hefty</text>
  <text start="382.05" dur="6.4">losses falling used car prices means</text>
  <text start="386.02" dur="6.78">pressure on new car prices as well which</text>
  <text start="388.45" dur="7.56">would be a shock to the American booming</text>
  <text start="392.8" dur="6.6">auto market and we see at this point</text>
  <text start="396.01" dur="5.1">that we have a lot of bubbles that were</text>
  <text start="399.4" dur="5.97">created by the central bank in this</text>
  <text start="401.11" dur="8.55">country and things are starting to leak</text>
  <text start="405.37" dur="5.94">and these bubbles are leaking and you</text>
  <text start="409.66" dur="4.26">know what happens the league gets larger</text>
  <text start="411.31" dur="5.19">and larger and then the whole thing just</text>
  <text start="413.92" dur="4.02">deflates this is what we are seeing at</text>
  <text start="416.5" dur="3.18">this point we&amp;#39;re seeing it in housing</text>
  <text start="417.94" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;re seeing it in the auto market we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="419.68" dur="5.88">seeing it in the stock market we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="423.25" dur="5.9">seeing it in the bond market it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="425.56" dur="6.11">coming together at the same exact time</text>
  <text start="429.15" dur="5.94">now in 24 years</text>
  <text start="431.67" dur="7.2">is the ratio of wholesale inventories to</text>
  <text start="435.09" dur="6.05">sales has only been higher than the</text>
  <text start="438.87" dur="5.4">current one point three five times once</text>
  <text start="441.14" dur="5.71">that was at the peak of the recession in</text>
  <text start="444.27" dur="5.43">the last financial crisis wholesale</text>
  <text start="446.85" dur="5.22">sales tumbled one-point-three percent</text>
  <text start="449.7" dur="6.21">month a month automotive inventories</text>
  <text start="452.07" dur="5.85">rose to 1.78 sales the highest since the</text>
  <text start="455.91" dur="5.61">crisis and basically what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="457.92" dur="7.56">right now sales are tumbling inventories</text>
  <text start="461.52" dur="8.21">are rising and we are headed right back</text>
  <text start="465.48" dur="7.71">to that area where we were in 2008 in</text>
  <text start="469.73" dur="9.49">2008 wholesale inventory to sales was</text>
  <text start="473.19" dur="9.9">around 1.45 or 1.5 we are at 1.35 right</text>
  <text start="479.22" dur="7.17">now we are approaching the same exact</text>
  <text start="483.09" dur="5.78">area and it only leads us to one thing</text>
  <text start="486.39" dur="4.17">and one thing only and that is a</text>
  <text start="488.87" dur="3.64">recession which will lead into a</text>
  <text start="490.56" dur="6.54">depression which will lead into a major</text>
  <text start="492.51" dur="6.51">collapse now we&amp;#39;ve all heard obama come</text>
  <text start="497.1" dur="3.63">out and say that you know anyone that</text>
  <text start="499.02" dur="3.24">doesn&amp;#39;t agree with me about the what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="500.73" dur="4.41">going on in the economy is peddling</text>
  <text start="502.26" dur="9.36">fiction but when you look at student</text>
  <text start="505.14" dur="10.68">loans food stamps federal debt money</text>
  <text start="511.62" dur="9.89">printing health care costs they are all</text>
  <text start="515.82" dur="8.22">rising rapidly the debt of student loans</text>
  <text start="521.51" dur="5.61">skyrocketing food stamps the number of</text>
  <text start="524.04" dur="6.9">people on it skyrocketing federal debt</text>
  <text start="527.12" dur="7.3">skyrocketing money printing skyrocketing</text>
  <text start="530.94" dur="9.02">health care costs skyrocketing and the</text>
  <text start="534.42" dur="5.54">labor force participation rate declining</text>
  <text start="540.2" dur="10.78">median family income declining home</text>
  <text start="545.37" dur="12.83">ownership the lowest since the 70s what</text>
  <text start="550.98" dur="11.58">does this tell you that this economy is</text>
  <text start="558.2" dur="6.619">completely fake think about it the</text>
  <text start="562.56" dur="6.219">fourth quarter</text>
  <text start="564.819" dur="7.17">gross domestic product in 2015 was one</text>
  <text start="568.779" dur="6.571">percent and this is absolutely awful</text>
  <text start="571.989" dur="6.32">because previous to this we were getting</text>
  <text start="575.35" dur="6.239">three to four percent in the economy and</text>
  <text start="578.309" dur="6.851">this was before they manipulated it so</text>
  <text start="581.589" dur="7.41">much after two thousand eight and we see</text>
  <text start="585.16" dur="8.609">those people who were working in</text>
  <text start="588.999" dur="9.09">full-time high-paying jobs they are</text>
  <text start="593.769" dur="7.41">getting part-time low-paying jobs or</text>
  <text start="598.089" dur="5.93">they can&amp;#39;t find work at all because we</text>
  <text start="601.179" dur="4.95">know since the last jobs report</text>
  <text start="604.019" dur="3.49">eighty-two percent of the jobs that were</text>
  <text start="606.129" dur="3.721">created were low paying service</text>
  <text start="607.509" dur="5.76">industries such as food service and</text>
  <text start="609.85" dur="5.279">retail now the retail section I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="613.269" dur="3.391">believe that&amp;#39;s accurate because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="615.129" dur="3.15">seeing a lot of stores layoffs and</text>
  <text start="616.66" dur="5.009">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us as the</text>
  <text start="618.279" dur="6.24">retail sector contracts they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="621.669" dur="6.991">hiring in retail so something doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="624.519" dur="6.39">make sense at this point and we know the</text>
  <text start="628.66" dur="4.56">government likes to tweak manipulate</text>
  <text start="630.909" dur="5.48">throw people into different groups to</text>
  <text start="633.22" dur="6.449">make it look like everything is fine</text>
  <text start="636.389" dur="5.23">remember if a company replaces a</text>
  <text start="639.669" dur="4.41">full-time worker with two part-time</text>
  <text start="641.619" dur="6.18">workers guess how they calculate that</text>
  <text start="644.079" dur="6.36">well the one that was laid off that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="647.799" dur="5.13">layoff the one that was hired part time</text>
  <text start="650.439" dur="4.86">that cancels off the layoff and the</text>
  <text start="652.929" dur="5.7">part-time work that they hired the</text>
  <text start="655.299" dur="7.801">additional person that&amp;#39;s an increase of</text>
  <text start="658.629" dur="7.62">one job so the whole thing is completely</text>
  <text start="663.1" dur="6.689">manipulated and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="666.249" dur="6.09">that their numbers don&amp;#39;t jive and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="669.789" dur="4.77">really going on in the economy now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="672.339" dur="4.35">been seeing the stock market fluctuate</text>
  <text start="674.559" dur="4.5">quite a bit we&amp;#39;re seeing that we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="676.689" dur="3.9">downward trend of course they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="679.059" dur="5.13">to pump it up that best they can but the</text>
  <text start="680.589" dur="6.99">market has been around 50 60 points</text>
  <text start="684.189" dur="6.36">sometimes it&amp;#39;s a little bit lower but it</text>
  <text start="687.579" dur="4.62">seems that they&amp;#39;re keeping it propped up</text>
  <text start="690.549" dur="2.94">the best they possibly can and this is</text>
  <text start="692.199" dur="3.33">the high-frequency traders the plunge</text>
  <text start="693.489" dur="3.87">protection team because when we look at</text>
  <text start="695.529" dur="2.831">the bank of america client flow trend</text>
  <text start="697.359" dur="5.22">monitor</text>
  <text start="698.36" dur="10.2">we&amp;#39;re seeing that the smart money is</text>
  <text start="702.579" dur="8.371">leaving as of march first we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="708.56" dur="6.209">that the stock market has climbed and</text>
  <text start="710.95" dur="6.52">we&amp;#39;re seeing that people for the fifth</text>
  <text start="714.769" dur="5.791">consecutive week have been leaving the</text>
  <text start="717.47" dur="6.72">market and so far the amount is about</text>
  <text start="720.56" dur="7.23">1.5 billion and this was the biggest</text>
  <text start="724.19" dur="6.389">weekly outflow since mid-december so it</text>
  <text start="727.79" dur="6.78">looks like people the smart money they</text>
  <text start="730.579" dur="6.241">realize that this is coming down they</text>
  <text start="734.57" dur="3.75">have this opportunity at this point to</text>
  <text start="736.82" dur="4.5">get out of the market it was propped up</text>
  <text start="738.32" dur="6.269">for them and they&amp;#39;re taking advantage of</text>
  <text start="741.32" dur="6.75">this and they&amp;#39;re leaving the market why</text>
  <text start="744.589" dur="8.011">because this entire system is about to</text>
  <text start="748.07" dur="6.389">fold collapse crash and this is what you</text>
  <text start="752.6" dur="3.33">need to be prepared for listen everyone</text>
  <text start="754.459" dur="3.69">thanks a lot for listening be well be</text>
