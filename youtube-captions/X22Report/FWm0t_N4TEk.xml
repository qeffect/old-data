  <text start="167.62" dur="6.69">trend where retail is continually</text>
  <text start="170.879" dur="7.211">contracting at this point now we talk</text>
  <text start="174.31" dur="5.25">about real estate quite a bit and of</text>
  <text start="178.09" dur="3.239">course the corporate media the US</text>
  <text start="179.56" dur="5.099">government central bankers are trying to</text>
  <text start="181.329" dur="5.821">convince us that real estate has bounced</text>
  <text start="184.659" dur="4.771">back it&amp;#39;s doing so much better but every</text>
  <text start="187.15" dur="4.89">time we look at it we see the opposite</text>
  <text start="189.43" dur="5.309">we see construction spending falling new</text>
  <text start="192.04" dur="6.809">construction declining existing home</text>
  <text start="194.739" dur="8.911">sales declining home sales have gone</text>
  <text start="198.849" dur="8.67">nowhere back in 2013 when Obama was in</text>
  <text start="203.65" dur="5.009">Phoenix Arizona of August of 2013 when</text>
  <text start="207.519" dur="3.33">he was making the announcement that the</text>
  <text start="208.659" dur="4.651">housing market is back on track nothing</text>
  <text start="210.849" dur="4.92">to worry about at the same time we know</text>
  <text start="213.31" dur="5.94">that the mortgage department&amp;#39;s of</text>
  <text start="215.769" dur="5.011">JPMorgan Chase Citibank Wells Fargo Bank</text>
  <text start="219.25" dur="2.909">of America were laying off thousands</text>
  <text start="220.78" dur="3.539">upon thousands of people because they</text>
  <text start="222.159" dur="3.811">knew at that point that the American</text>
  <text start="224.319" dur="2.911">people are sitting on the sidelines and</text>
  <text start="225.97" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re not going to be taking out</text>
  <text start="227.23" dur="3.39">mortgages they&amp;#39;re going to depend on the</text>
  <text start="229.18" dur="3.3">free money hedge funds investment</text>
  <text start="230.62" dur="3.709">companies to go in and purchase up</text>
  <text start="232.48" dur="4.11">thousands upon thousands of homes</text>
  <text start="234.329" dur="5.41">they&amp;#39;re hoping that for investors would</text>
  <text start="236.59" dur="5.97">come in and purchase homes well things</text>
  <text start="239.739" dur="6.421">are drastically declining at this point</text>
  <text start="242.56" dur="7.44">and Obama and his administration they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="246.16" dur="6.57">making a huge push now to make home</text>
  <text start="250" dur="6.599">loans available to people with even</text>
  <text start="252.73" dur="6.599">weaker credit than before they are</text>
  <text start="256.599" dur="5.731">working to get banks to lend to a wider</text>
  <text start="259.329" dur="6.06">range of borrowers by taking advantage</text>
  <text start="262.33" dur="4.32">of the taxpayer back programs including</text>
  <text start="265.389" dur="3.96">those offered by the Federal Housing</text>
  <text start="266.65" dur="6.48">Administration that ensure home loans</text>
  <text start="269.349" dur="5.731">against default so on the one hand the</text>
  <text start="273.13" dur="3.779">Obama administration is out there saying</text>
  <text start="275.08" dur="3.959">that you know we&amp;#39;ve cleaned up the</text>
  <text start="276.909" dur="4.711">financial system we have recovered</text>
  <text start="279.039" dur="8.031">everything is fine people are buying</text>
  <text start="281.62" dur="9.75">again and on the other hand he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="287.07" dur="7.33">well we&amp;#39;re gonna give loans to sub sub</text>
  <text start="291.37" dur="6.31">sub prime people right now to help them</text>
  <text start="294.4" dur="5.549">purchase homes now the only reason</text>
  <text start="297.68" dur="5.91">the government steps in like this and</text>
  <text start="299.949" dur="7">brings in more people into a certain</text>
  <text start="303.59" dur="7.5">program that has to do with loaning</text>
  <text start="306.949" dur="6.481">money is to increase the bubble because</text>
  <text start="311.09" dur="4.38">remember the American people they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="313.43" dur="6.2">have the funds they don&amp;#39;t have the jobs</text>
  <text start="315.47" dur="7.1">and the banks are a little bit nervous</text>
  <text start="319.63" dur="5.65">loaning these funds to these people so</text>
  <text start="322.57" dur="5.92">it&amp;#39;s great news for the banks because</text>
  <text start="325.28" dur="11.69">what they&amp;#39;re going to do is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="328.49" dur="12.049">going to ensure or guarantee the loans</text>
  <text start="336.97" dur="8.919">allow the banks to make more loans and</text>
  <text start="340.539" dur="8.141">they will make profit and of course when</text>
  <text start="345.889" dur="5.721">everything falls apart what happens the</text>
  <text start="348.68" dur="6.03">government makes up the difference</text>
  <text start="351.61" dur="4.96">actually the taxpayers make up the</text>
  <text start="354.71" dur="5.4">difference so we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="356.57" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re doing this to push the bubble</text>
  <text start="360.11" dur="5.88">even further because they starting to</text>
  <text start="362.09" dur="5.19">realize that the free money the hedge</text>
  <text start="365.99" dur="3.12">fund investment companies that are</text>
  <text start="367.28" dur="5.16">purchasing it&amp;#39;s not enough at this point</text>
  <text start="369.11" dur="4.83">they need Americans remember most of the</text>
  <text start="372.44" dur="3.96">bubbles that we&amp;#39;re seeing right now are</text>
  <text start="373.94" dur="3.509">central bank bubbles the Americans are</text>
  <text start="376.4" dur="2.94">sitting on the sidelines and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="377.449" dur="4.561">starting to realize they can&amp;#39;t keep this</text>
  <text start="379.34" dur="3.66">up they need the Americans to come in</text>
  <text start="382.01" dur="3.12">now there are certain things they can</text>
  <text start="383" dur="5.37">control especially things with loans</text>
  <text start="385.13" dur="5.52">like auto loans housing student loans</text>
  <text start="388.37" dur="4.44">but things like people going out and</text>
  <text start="390.65" dur="3.54">purchasing retail well yeah people can</text>
  <text start="392.81" dur="4.229">use credit cards but most of the time</text>
  <text start="394.19" dur="4.8">people say you know something I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="397.039" dur="5.821">have the funds I&amp;#39;m not going to do it</text>
  <text start="398.99" dur="5.31">and we can see right now that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="402.86" dur="2.52">trying to control this market but I</text>
  <text start="404.3" dur="2.46">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s going to help at this</text>
  <text start="405.38" dur="3.45">point I think it&amp;#39;s a little too late I</text>
  <text start="406.76" dur="3.81">think the people at this point are</text>
  <text start="408.83" dur="5.1">completely tapped out too many people</text>
  <text start="410.57" dur="5.37">are losing jobs and the people out in</text>
  <text start="413.93" dur="3.69">the market right now there might be a</text>
  <text start="415.94" dur="2.82">few but most of them are gonna set back</text>
  <text start="417.62" dur="2.729">and say you know something I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="418.76" dur="4.469">gonna wait because I&amp;#39;m starting to see</text>
  <text start="420.349" dur="4.741">housing prices come down the market</text>
  <text start="423.229" dur="4.37">doesn&amp;#39;t look too good people have houses</text>
  <text start="425.09" dur="4.71">on the market for a very long time and</text>
  <text start="427.599" dur="3.911">they&amp;#39;re doing this because they realize</text>
  <text start="429.8" dur="4.01">the bubble is popping</text>
  <text start="431.51" dur="7.44">and they&amp;#39;re trying to keep it inflated</text>
  <text start="433.81" dur="9.64">now Puerto Rico they have just passed a</text>
  <text start="438.95" dur="8.03">bill on Wednesday that will suspend debt</text>
  <text start="443.45" dur="6.15">payments until January of 2017</text>
  <text start="446.98" dur="5.11">now Puerto Rico handed the control of</text>
  <text start="449.6" dur="4.83">their federal bond cells to Wall Street</text>
  <text start="452.09" dur="4.41">executives and the Wall Street</text>
  <text start="454.43" dur="4.47">executives tacked on hundreds of</text>
  <text start="456.5" dur="4.41">millions in fees for their services and</text>
  <text start="458.9" dur="3.84">Puerto Rico Center gone well we couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="460.91" dur="5.31">pay it before do you really think with</text>
  <text start="462.74" dur="6.87">the fees tacked on we can pay it now so</text>
  <text start="466.22" dur="6.83">they&amp;#39;re suspending all debt and all the</text>
  <text start="469.61" dur="6.84">fees and everything else because</text>
  <text start="473.05" dur="6.91">basically Berto Rico&amp;#39;s bankrupt they</text>
  <text start="476.45" dur="7.95">have nothing left they are completely</text>
  <text start="479.96" dur="7.8">done now something very interesting in</text>
  <text start="484.4" dur="7.52">Greece we see that on the Greek Turkish</text>
  <text start="487.76" dur="7.23">border the government confiscated</text>
  <text start="491.92" dur="6.81">individuals trying to smuggle gold over</text>
  <text start="494.99" dur="7.76">the border into Turkey and they</text>
  <text start="498.73" dur="8.5">confiscated 18 bars of unrefined gold</text>
  <text start="502.75" dur="6.25">weighing about 33.5 kilos and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="507.23" dur="4.56">saying that there were four crosses made</text>
  <text start="509" dur="4.5">of pure gold and the value of the gold</text>
  <text start="511.79" dur="6.12">was about eight hundred thousand euros</text>
  <text start="513.5" dur="6.62">now the question is who in Turkey wanted</text>
  <text start="517.91" dur="5.22">this gold or was it people in Greece</text>
  <text start="520.12" dur="5.05">trying to escape with their wealth but</text>
  <text start="523.13" dur="4.11">the government has confiscated it and</text>
  <text start="525.17" dur="4.44">now they have it so we&amp;#39;ll have to look</text>
  <text start="527.24" dur="5.88">at that situation and see how that turns</text>
  <text start="529.61" dur="5.22">out now the New York Times is out there</text>
  <text start="533.12" dur="2.88">and it looks like they&amp;#39;re demonizing</text>
  <text start="534.83" dur="2.73">gold at this point it looks like the</text>
  <text start="536" dur="4.08">corporate media is jumping on the</text>
  <text start="537.56" dur="5.91">bandwagon and they&amp;#39;re showing Osama bin</text>
  <text start="540.08" dur="5.49">Laden saying that you know he was a gold</text>
  <text start="543.47" dur="3.42">bug and we see why they&amp;#39;re doing it at</text>
  <text start="545.57" dur="4.17">this point because what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="546.89" dur="4.23">happen from this point on is that gold</text>
  <text start="549.74" dur="5.28">is gonna start to rise we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="551.12" dur="5.4">it rise 10 then 25 then 35 and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="555.02" dur="2.52">gonna try to keep the people out of the</text>
  <text start="556.52" dur="3.42">market they&amp;#39;re gonna try to tell people</text>
  <text start="557.54" dur="4.41">listen only criminals terrorists and</text>
  <text start="559.94" dur="4.14">those type of people would actually go</text>
  <text start="561.95" dur="3.18">buy gold so don&amp;#39;t do it because what</text>
  <text start="564.08" dur="4.14">happens when</text>
  <text start="565.13" dur="5.43">one goes and tries to purchase gold I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="568.22" dur="4.98">talking about the physical gold the</text>
  <text start="570.56" dur="5.43">price goes up and when people start</text>
  <text start="573.2" dur="4.11">seeing the price go up that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="575.99" dur="3.45">exactly what&amp;#39;s going to happen so</text>
  <text start="577.31" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re already starting the propaganda</text>
  <text start="579.44" dur="3.99">out there they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="580.91" dur="4.17">everyone that I wouldn&amp;#39;t go out and</text>
  <text start="583.43" dur="3.21">purchase gold and if you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="585.08" dur="3.54">purchased gold or silver any type of</text>
  <text start="586.64" dur="4.05">precious metals at this time this would</text>
  <text start="588.62" dur="4.83">be a good time to do it now I do not</text>
  <text start="590.69" dur="5.25">sell it whatsoever I purchase it myself</text>
  <text start="593.45" dur="4.83">I know a lot of people are hurting today</text>
  <text start="595.94" dur="6.18">I know people don&amp;#39;t have the funds I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="598.28" dur="6.72">with you some days I only purchase two</text>
  <text start="602.12" dur="6.45">silver eagles some months I only</text>
  <text start="605" dur="6.33">purchase four silver eagles sometimes I</text>
  <text start="608.57" dur="5.1">only purchase one Silver Eagle sometimes</text>
  <text start="611.33" dur="5.76">I save up enough and I can purchase a</text>
  <text start="613.67" dur="6.83">tenth of gold but I&amp;#39;ve been doing this</text>
  <text start="617.09" dur="5.94">for quite a while so I have amassed</text>
  <text start="620.5" dur="4.06">quite a bit of gold and silver at this</text>
  <text start="623.03" dur="5.34">point because I did a little bit at a</text>
  <text start="624.56" dur="7.08">time but if you haven&amp;#39;t done it in the</text>
  <text start="628.37" dur="9.24">past I would start now do it before</text>
  <text start="631.64" dur="10.71">everything goes and falls apart now</text>
  <text start="637.61" dur="7.32">Obama is trying to bring in as many</text>
  <text start="642.35" dur="5.58">illegal immigrants as we as you possibly</text>
  <text start="644.93" dur="5.64">can as we know and we talked about this</text>
  <text start="647.93" dur="4.92">many many times about how he wants to</text>
  <text start="650.57" dur="4.68">give him working papers he wants them to</text>
  <text start="652.85" dur="4.44">take out loans they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="655.25" dur="5.4">the economy going with the lower end</text>
  <text start="657.29" dur="5.37">people who don&amp;#39;t have debt yet who are</text>
  <text start="660.65" dur="3.96">willing to purchase a car who are</text>
  <text start="662.66" dur="3.99">willing to take out a student loan who</text>
  <text start="664.61" dur="7.35">are willing to take the lower paying</text>
  <text start="666.65" dur="9.84">jobs and we see right now that Obama is</text>
  <text start="671.96" dur="7.23">trying to push the idea</text>
  <text start="676.49" dur="7.26">maash and say the idea he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
