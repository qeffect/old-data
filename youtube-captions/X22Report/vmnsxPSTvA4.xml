  <text start="150.72" dur="3.66">fifty-fifty chance here and this is a</text>
  <text start="152.849" dur="4.951">problem and we&amp;#39;re not just seeing this</text>
  <text start="154.38" dur="5.219">out in the UK we&amp;#39;re also seeing it here</text>
  <text start="157.8" dur="3.659">in the United States and here in the</text>
  <text start="159.599" dur="3.601">United States the economy is just</text>
  <text start="161.459" dur="3.36">getting worse and worse and worse things</text>
  <text start="163.2" dur="2.97">are not getting better I know a lot of</text>
  <text start="164.819" dur="3.181">people think they are getting better and</text>
  <text start="166.17" dur="3.03">of course the corporate media and the</text>
  <text start="168" dur="4.14">government is out there telling you that</text>
  <text start="169.2" dur="5.899">oh GDP it&amp;#39;s coming in at three percent</text>
  <text start="172.14" dur="5.04">but these are all manipulated numbers</text>
  <text start="175.099" dur="4.301">coming from a watchdog</text>
  <text start="177.18" dur="4.92">they looked at the overall economy and</text>
  <text start="179.4" dur="5.64">they noticed that 43 percent of adults</text>
  <text start="182.1" dur="4.5">are struggling to make ends meet and I</text>
  <text start="185.04" dur="4.11">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if the</text>
  <text start="186.6" dur="5.22">number was even higher than this and</text>
  <text start="189.15" dur="5.37">when I say you know they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="191.82" dur="4.14">troubles making ends meet what their if</text>
  <text start="194.52" dur="2.49">what they&amp;#39;re finding and this is coming</text>
  <text start="195.96" dur="4.35">from the Consumer Financial Protection</text>
  <text start="197.01" dur="6.93">Bureau is that this survey shows that</text>
  <text start="200.31" dur="5.22">they can&amp;#39;t make their monthly bills more</text>
  <text start="203.94" dur="3.98">than one-third said they experienced a</text>
  <text start="205.53" dur="5.52">financial hardship within the past year</text>
  <text start="207.92" dur="4.68">not in the past eight years just in the</text>
  <text start="211.05" dur="5.85">past year</text>
  <text start="212.6" dur="5.95">43% they&amp;#39;re running out of food they</text>
  <text start="216.9" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t have enough for rent or their</text>
  <text start="218.55" dur="5.58">mortgage they don&amp;#39;t have enough for</text>
  <text start="220.65" dur="6.75">medical expenses because the full-time</text>
  <text start="224.13" dur="5.7">jobs are disappearing they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="227.4" dur="6.15">replaced by these low-paying part-time</text>
  <text start="229.83" dur="6.06">jobs and these people and we know that</text>
  <text start="233.55" dur="5.22">there&amp;#39;s many of us out there we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="235.89" dur="4.71">working one to three part-time jobs to</text>
  <text start="238.77" dur="3.96">make ends meet now remember it now the</text>
  <text start="240.6" dur="5.13">government counts each one of these jobs</text>
  <text start="242.73" dur="5.19">as a full-time job this is how they</text>
  <text start="245.73" dur="5.25">manipulate a lot of these numbers and</text>
  <text start="247.92" dur="8.01">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the economy is</text>
  <text start="250.98" dur="8.22">actually sliding into a downward trend</text>
  <text start="255.93" dur="5.22">and there is nothing they can do to make</text>
  <text start="259.2" dur="4.02">it better now they can manipulate</text>
  <text start="261.15" dur="3.54">numbers they can tell you that GDP is 3</text>
  <text start="263.22" dur="2.82">percent the stock market is continually</text>
  <text start="264.69" dur="3.33">going up they can even tell you that</text>
  <text start="266.04" dur="4.38">unemployment is 2 percent but these</text>
  <text start="268.02" dur="5.07">numbers are meaningless at the end of</text>
  <text start="270.42" dur="4.68">the day I mean let&amp;#39;s look at durable</text>
  <text start="273.09" dur="5.34">goods for instance it collapsed in July</text>
  <text start="275.1" dur="4.68">I mean there was no airplane orders or</text>
  <text start="278.43" dur="3.42">things like that and the durable goods</text>
  <text start="279.78" dur="4.02">are you know washers dryers and things</text>
  <text start="281.85" dur="3.54">like that but normal things that people</text>
  <text start="283.8" dur="3.2">go out and purchase because a person&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.39" dur="6.3">not going out and buying an airplane</text>
  <text start="287" dur="8.11">well it looks like this month durable</text>
  <text start="291.69" dur="6.35">goods shot up it bounced up why because</text>
  <text start="295.11" dur="5.25">it was on aircraft orders it wasn&amp;#39;t on</text>
  <text start="298.04" dur="2.89">washers and dryers and the big-ticket</text>
  <text start="300.36" dur="2.94">items</text>
  <text start="300.93" dur="5.82">it was non-defense aircraft orders which</text>
  <text start="303.3" dur="6.63">jumped 44.8% month a month this is why</text>
  <text start="306.75" dur="5.37">durable goods bounced back but when we</text>
  <text start="309.93" dur="5.88">look at whatever the everyday person is</text>
  <text start="312.12" dur="7.44">doing this didn&amp;#39;t move actually declined</text>
  <text start="315.81" dur="4.59">now let&amp;#39;s go to housing now think about</text>
  <text start="319.56" dur="3.81">it</text>
  <text start="320.4" dur="7.01">the interest rates are the lowest that</text>
  <text start="323.37" dur="5.549">we&amp;#39;ve ever seen I mean they are very</text>
  <text start="327.41" dur="3.819">very low</text>
  <text start="328.919" dur="5.28">you would think everyone will be going</text>
  <text start="331.229" dur="5.821">out and getting a mortgage and buying a</text>
  <text start="334.199" dur="6.331">home especially during the summer months</text>
  <text start="337.05" dur="6.81">this is the popular season to purchase a</text>
  <text start="340.53" dur="6.81">home this summer is a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="343.86" dur="6.3">and we&amp;#39;ve seen other summers where</text>
  <text start="347.34" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;ve been declining and we&amp;#39;ve reached</text>
  <text start="350.16" dur="3.03">this summer where it&amp;#39;s a complete</text>
  <text start="351.96" dur="2.67">disaster now we knew this was gonna</text>
  <text start="353.19" dur="4.349">happen now of course they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="354.63" dur="4.98">that prices are rising that there is you</text>
  <text start="357.539" dur="4.141">know not many houses out there for</text>
  <text start="359.61" dur="4.05">people to choose but if you go on Zillow</text>
  <text start="361.68" dur="6.14">and you go into a neighborhood you see</text>
  <text start="363.66" dur="8.039">tons of houses that are for sale now</text>
  <text start="367.82" dur="9.93">pending home sales they have dropped</text>

  <text start="410.22" dur="5.28">bounce back in the winter of 2008 had no</text>
  <text start="413.16" dur="4.74">idea what was really going on here but</text>
  <text start="415.5" dur="4.77">he&amp;#39;s saying that this summer&amp;#39;s terribly</text>
  <text start="417.9" dur="4.41">low supply levels have officially</text>

  <text start="424.68" dur="5.94">stalled now the housing market is</text>
  <text start="427.02" dur="7.019">stalled because people don&amp;#39;t have jobs</text>
  <text start="430.62" dur="5.91">people don&amp;#39;t feel comfortable in their</text>
  <text start="434.039" dur="5.461">current work situation they&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="441.81" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="444.51" dur="4.05">because there&amp;#39;s just no houses on the</text>
  <text start="446.46" dur="7.26">market now remember how they created</text>
  <text start="448.56" dur="7.8">this fantasy they had hedge funds in</text>

  <text start="478.68" dur="3.75">purchase homes in down Miami in Florida</text>
  <text start="480.27" dur="6.36">you had the South Americans coming in</text>

  <text start="486.63" dur="4.08">they were building and remember this is</text>
  <text start="488.34" dur="4.59">all speculative we know what happened in</text>
  <text start="490.71" dur="4.65">2008 well that whole thing just</text>
  <text start="492.93" dur="4.8">completely crashed on itself and what</text>
  <text start="495.36" dur="4.62">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the same exact</text>
  <text start="497.73" dur="5.79">thing happening the Chinese money is</text>
  <text start="499.98" dur="5.22">drying up the real American well they</text>

  <text start="522.12" dur="3.45">much space out there because this is</text>
  <text start="524.19" dur="3.66">going to be a complete disaster</text>

  <text start="533.4" dur="6.78">down the real estate market is going to</text>
  <text start="537.089" dur="4.591">bring everything else down and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="540.18" dur="3.09">going to be a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="541.68" dur="4.29">disaster because connected to</text>
  <text start="543.27" dur="7.56">construction to lumber to the</text>
  <text start="545.97" dur="6.6">electrician to asphalt to steel to you</text>

  <text start="555.93" dur="4.5">Lowe&amp;#39;s I mean all these stores it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="558.87" dur="3">gonna come to a screeching halt and this</text>
  <text start="560.43" dur="3.18">is what we see right now we see the</text>
  <text start="561.87" dur="3.51">cracks we&amp;#39;ve been watching the cracks</text>
  <text start="563.61" dur="4.71">and they&amp;#39;re spreading apart and the</text>
  <text start="565.38" dur="4.95">economy is imploding on itself and then</text>
  <text start="568.32" dur="3.87">we need to remember the Fed is out there</text>
  <text start="570.33" dur="3.33">telling us that they&amp;#39;re going to unwind</text>
  <text start="572.19" dur="5.1">their balance sheet which we know this</text>
  <text start="573.66" dur="5.58">is really not going to happen because</text>
  <text start="577.29" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;ve been adding to their balance</text>
  <text start="579.24" dur="4.77">sheet actually what&amp;#39;s unwinding is the</text>
  <text start="581.61" dur="4.2">economy they also talked about inflation</text>
  <text start="584.01" dur="2.97">and the other Fed houses talked about</text>
  <text start="585.81" dur="2.14">inflation and they came up with</text>
  <text start="586.98" dur="2.68">different couch</text>
  <text start="587.95" dur="5.73">saying that inflation was much higher</text>
  <text start="589.66" dur="5.43">than the feds calculation and actually</text>
  <text start="593.68" dur="2.58">Johnny Yellen came out and said listen</text>
  <text start="595.09" dur="3.81">we really don&amp;#39;t know much about</text>
  <text start="596.26" dur="4.83">inflation or employment and she actually</text>
  <text start="598.9" dur="4.23">admitted this and what during this</text>
  <text start="601.09" dur="4.08">period of time we see the US dollar is</text>
  <text start="603.13" dur="4.47">dropping it dropped something like 10</text>
  <text start="605.17" dur="5.16">percent this year and it&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="607.6" dur="5.28">dropping and this tells us that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="610.33" dur="4.35">an inflationary storm headed our way and</text>
  <text start="612.88" dur="3.27">as we can see there are many commending</text>
  <text start="614.68" dur="5.43">countries moving away from the dollar</text>
  <text start="616.15" dur="6.66">and once these countries use a different</text>
  <text start="620.11" dur="5.31">currency to pay for the oil countries</text>
  <text start="622.81" dur="4.5">out around the world don&amp;#39;t have to use</text>
  <text start="625.42" dur="3.9">the dollar anymore to pay for oil</text>
  <text start="627.31" dur="4.05">because they&amp;#39;ll use a different currency</text>
  <text start="629.32" dur="3.51">to pay for oil that means that dollar is</text>
  <text start="631.36" dur="3.93">gonna flood back to the United States</text>
  <text start="632.83" dur="4.38">and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing this is</text>
  <text start="635.29" dur="3.48">the beginning stages of this this is</text>
  <text start="637.21" dur="3.06">what we&amp;#39;re watching right now now we</text>
  <text start="638.77" dur="2.85">talked about this for a very long time</text>
  <text start="640.27" dur="6.42">we knew it was going to eventually come</text>
  <text start="641.62" dur="7.5">here it is today it is headed our way</text>
  <text start="646.69" dur="5.22">and you&amp;#39;re going to see things start to</text>
  <text start="649.12" dur="4.23">creep up in cost that means the value of</text>
  <text start="651.91" dur="3.51">the dollar is decreasing because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="653.35" dur="4.53">more dollars in circulation which means</text>
  <text start="655.42" dur="5.55">more dollars you&amp;#39;ll need more dollars to</text>
  <text start="657.88" dur="5.49">pay for that that that good that is</text>

  <text start="670.15" dur="3.42">start to creep up a little bit at a time</text>
  <text start="671.71" dur="3.45">and then all of a sudden everyone&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="684.13" dur="5.04">makes no sense whatsoever and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="687.339" dur="4.291">to spread across the country people are</text>
  <text start="689.17" dur="5.19">gonna start to realize that we have an</text>
  <text start="691.63" dur="4.2">inflationary problem here and then</text>
  <text start="694.36" dur="3.27">people are going to start to worry</text>
  <text start="695.83" dur="4.11">people are gonna say okay you know what</text>
  <text start="697.63" dur="3.75">I better stock up because once they go</text>
  <text start="699.94" dur="3.33">out and they purchase these items and</text>
  <text start="701.38" dur="3.48">they see you know a couple days later or</text>
  <text start="703.27" dur="3.96">weeks later that the prices have gone up</text>
  <text start="704.86" dur="4.2">again they&amp;#39;re gonna start hoarding these</text>
  <text start="707.23" dur="3.03">items because they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="709.06" dur="2.88">realize and this happened in Weimar</text>
  <text start="710.26" dur="4.47">Germany and many other countries where</text>
  <text start="711.94" dur="4.68">people would see the price of goods they</text>
  <text start="714.73" dur="3.9">would see meat you know all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="716.62" dur="3.15">went up like two or three dollars in a</text>
  <text start="718.63" dur="2.4">couple of days so they said you know</text>
  <text start="719.77" dur="3.93">something I better buy this</text>
  <text start="721.03" dur="5.52">because my currency is going to be worth</text>
  <text start="723.7" dur="5.07">less in a couple days or a couple of</text>
  <text start="726.55" dur="5.01">weeks than it is now so let me get what</text>
  <text start="728.77" dur="4.38">I need right now and we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="731.56" dur="3.03">this happen is going to creep up and</text>
  <text start="733.15" dur="3.06">people are going to be completely</text>
  <text start="734.59" dur="3.9">shocked this is why we&amp;#39;ve been saying</text>
  <text start="736.21" dur="3.9">get prepared and ready all the things</text>
  <text start="738.49" dur="3.75">that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about everything</text>
  <text start="740.11" dur="4.08">that we&amp;#39;ve been showing well they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="742.24" dur="4.38">starting to come into play and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="744.19" dur="4.44">all starting to creep in now and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="746.62" dur="4.2">going to see this accelerate as we move</text>
  <text start="748.63" dur="3.81">along and this is why you need to have</text>
  <text start="750.82" dur="4.5">food you need to have supplies you need</text>
  <text start="752.44" dur="5.25">to have water get it now because but</text>
  <text start="755.32" dur="5.85">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of cheap right now just</text>
  <text start="757.69" dur="5.64">like precious metals is very cheap right</text>
  <text start="761.17" dur="4.92">now but what happens when the dollar</text>
  <text start="763.33" dur="5.22">continually decreases gold silver</text>
  <text start="766.09" dur="4.5">especially when they lose the ability to</text>
  <text start="768.55" dur="4.23">manipulate that is going to increase in</text>
  <text start="770.59" dur="4.11">price and we can see right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="772.78" dur="2.85">headed in that direction because we</text>
  <text start="774.7" dur="2.94">could see with gold</text>
  <text start="775.63" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s big and silver it&amp;#39;s becoming harder</text>
  <text start="777.64" dur="3.33">and harder to keep the price down it</text>
  <text start="779.5" dur="5.25">continually moves up a little bit at a</text>
  <text start="780.97" dur="5.85">time so at this point you should be</text>
  <text start="784.75" dur="4.589">looking at what the economy is doing not</text>
  <text start="786.82" dur="4.019">the statistical numbers that the</text>
  <text start="789.339" dur="3.271">government is putting out there not what</text>
  <text start="790.839" dur="3.271">the Fed is telling us because they tell</text>
  <text start="792.61" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re telling us the opposite of</text>
  <text start="794.11" dur="4.65">what&amp;#39;s really happening we need to be</text>
  <text start="796.96" dur="3.99">ready and prepared for what is coming</text>
  <text start="798.76" dur="4.35">because we can see what is happening out</text>
  <text start="800.95" dur="4.47">in the middle east we can see the plan</text>
  <text start="803.11" dur="4.83">to capture and control the natural</text>
  <text start="805.42" dur="6.48">resources that is failing this is just</text>
  <text start="807.94" dur="6.42">common sense I mean if the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="811.9" dur="5.31">is no longer used on oil where does it</text>
  <text start="814.36" dur="5.04">go I mean the countries don&amp;#39;t need it</text>
  <text start="817.21" dur="5.82">and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing play out</text>
