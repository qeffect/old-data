  <text start="104.619" dur="5.941">happening in the economy and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="108.429" dur="3.681">looking around and they&amp;#39;re saying to</text>
  <text start="110.56" dur="6.089">themselves okay if the economy is</text>
  <text start="112.11" dur="7.27">collapsing like dave is saying why do i</text>

  <text start="119.38" dur="7.5">people at sporting events why do i see</text>
  <text start="121.42" dur="7.44">people doing everyday things well let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="126.88" dur="4.71">think about this for a second i know</text>
  <text start="128.86" dur="5.19">many people that as they were losing</text>
  <text start="131.59" dur="5.06">their job as they were still looking for</text>
  <text start="134.05" dur="5.73">another job back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="136.65" dur="5.38">they kept the illusion alive that</text>
  <text start="139.78" dur="5.52">everything was fine they used credit</text>
  <text start="142.03" dur="6.03">cards they kept doing their everyday</text>
  <text start="145.3" dur="6.57">things all the different clubs they were</text>
  <text start="148.06" dur="6.09">they belong to they kept all the</text>
  <text start="151.87" dur="6.27">activities their children were in they</text>
  <text start="154.15" dur="5.94">kept they made it seem like everything</text>
  <text start="158.14" dur="6.21">was okay and they just kept on doing it</text>
  <text start="160.09" dur="6.24">and many people today and</text>
  <text start="164.35" dur="5.61">no it&amp;#39;s hard to say they don&amp;#39;t like to</text>
  <text start="166.33" dur="6.87">give up what they have for many it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="169.96" dur="7.73">very very difficult and I understand</text>
  <text start="173.2" dur="7.38">this and many people that I know</text>
  <text start="177.69" dur="5.59">continue with the illusion everyone has</text>
  <text start="180.58" dur="6.81">credit cards think about it in today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="183.28" dur="8.55">economy if we took away all credit cards</text>
  <text start="187.39" dur="7.08">and nobody has any credit how many</text>
  <text start="191.83" dur="7.88">people do you think would have the</text>
  <text start="194.47" dur="9.12">ability to survive every day with food</text>
  <text start="199.71" dur="7.39">with purchasing fuel for your car making</text>
  <text start="203.59" dur="5.82">payments now there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="207.1" dur="4.58">population out there that yes they have</text>
  <text start="209.41" dur="5.76">the ability to pay for all of this</text>
  <text start="211.68" dur="4.6">because they make enough money and yes</text>
  <text start="215.17" dur="3.77">there are still people out there that</text>
  <text start="216.28" dur="5.7">are making money and then you can have</text>
  <text start="218.94" dur="6.73">the general population which is probably</text>
  <text start="221.98" dur="7.44">a very large percentage where they</text>
  <text start="225.67" dur="6.75">wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to survive and I see it</text>
  <text start="229.42" dur="4.68">every single day where people are</text>
  <text start="232.42" dur="3.57">putting things on credit cards and</text>
  <text start="234.1" dur="5.16">continually running the debt higher and</text>
  <text start="235.99" dur="7.08">higher our society has been built on</text>
  <text start="239.26" dur="8.76">debt do a little experiment with</text>
  <text start="243.07" dur="6.12">yourself try living without credit now</text>
  <text start="248.02" dur="2.73">there are many people out there saying</text>
  <text start="249.19" dur="3.66">well I don&amp;#39;t have any credit cards and</text>
  <text start="250.75" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s very difficult to live right now</text>
  <text start="252.85" dur="4.92">there are other saying I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="255.13" dur="6.54">able to survive whatsoever if I removed</text>
  <text start="257.77" dur="6.6">them that&amp;#39;s it for me and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.67" dur="5.13">happening in our economy is we&amp;#39;re stuck</text>
  <text start="264.37" dur="4.17">in this illusion because when you pay</text>
  <text start="266.8" dur="3.69">for something on credit you really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="268.54" dur="4.68">have the money if you have a balance on</text>
  <text start="270.49" dur="5.79">your credit card you never had the money</text>
  <text start="273.22" dur="5.07">to do what you&amp;#39;re doing and a lot of</text>
  <text start="276.28" dur="4.2">people out there are doing this now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="278.29" dur="6.45">not putting anyone down for this I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="280.48" dur="7.29">saying it&amp;#39;s wrong but this is how many</text>
  <text start="284.74" dur="8.91">of the people out there survive today</text>
  <text start="287.77" dur="7.35">and the illusion that people are doing</text>
  <text start="293.65" dur="3.63">okay that people can go to these events</text>
  <text start="295.12" dur="4.14">people can go on vacations</text>
  <text start="297.28" dur="5.58">many people just whip out the credit</text>
  <text start="299.26" dur="7.11">card and they make the small little tiny</text>
  <text start="302.86" dur="5.1">payments because you can take it you can</text>
  <text start="306.37" dur="3.78">charge something for a thousand two</text>
  <text start="307.96" dur="4.95">thousand dollars and make that whatever</text>
  <text start="310.15" dur="6.17">it is 60 70 forty dollars a month</text>
  <text start="312.91" dur="7.08">payment but eventually what happens is</text>
  <text start="316.32" dur="5.83">it catches up with you especially if you</text>
  <text start="319.99" dur="4.5">lose your job and you&amp;#39;re looking for a</text>
  <text start="322.15" dur="5.1">job things become very very difficult</text>
  <text start="324.49" dur="6.03">and those people that have gone through</text>
  <text start="327.25" dur="5.82">it realize it those people that lost</text>
  <text start="330.52" dur="4.5">their jobs never got the same pay high</text>
  <text start="333.07" dur="4.23">paying job that they had before they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="335.02" dur="4.77">have except a part-time job but still</text>
  <text start="337.3" dur="5.4">had their bills still had the credit</text>
  <text start="339.79" dur="6.42">card bills still had the electric bill</text>
  <text start="342.7" dur="6.21">still had the car payment bill it is</text>
  <text start="346.21" dur="4.86">very difficult to get by and this is why</text>
  <text start="348.91" dur="4.97">we&amp;#39;re seeing everyone out there today</text>
  <text start="351.07" dur="4.95">and it looks like nothing is going on</text>
  <text start="353.88" dur="4.9">but when you start to talk to those</text>
  <text start="356.02" dur="4.8">people you start to realize that there</text>
  <text start="358.78" dur="6.17">are many many problems I know someone</text>
  <text start="360.82" dur="7.83">that lives in the area where I am and</text>
  <text start="364.95" dur="5.469">he&amp;#39;s been out of work for a year he got</text>
  <text start="368.65" dur="5.82">a job two months later he was laid off</text>
  <text start="370.419" dur="6.151">once again but they keep the illusion</text>
  <text start="374.47" dur="4.62">alive and they keep doing the things</text>
  <text start="376.57" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re doing they haven&amp;#39;t stopped so</text>
  <text start="379.09" dur="3.66">whatever they had saved in the bank</text>
  <text start="380.71" dur="5.07">whatever credit cards they have they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="382.75" dur="6.75">continually using it but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="385.78" dur="6.42">seeing in the economy is that all the</text>
  <text start="389.5" dur="6.33">economic indicators they are signaling</text>
  <text start="392.2" dur="5.91">the economy is collapsing now back in</text>
  <text start="395.83" dur="3.39">two thousand eight if we track this all</text>
  <text start="398.11" dur="4.679">the way up to the point when it</text>
  <text start="399.22" dur="7.08">collapsed we would have seen it we would</text>
  <text start="402.789" dur="5.071">have seen all of it building building</text>
  <text start="406.3" dur="3.6">building until the collapse occurred</text>
  <text start="407.86" dur="4.92">because it just doesn&amp;#39;t happen on that</text>
  <text start="409.9" dur="5.639">day when the market comes down people</text>
  <text start="412.78" dur="5.67">might think it does but it doesn&amp;#39;t but</text>
  <text start="415.539" dur="5.461">builds over time and the US government</text>
  <text start="418.45" dur="6.45">and central bank they&amp;#39;ve been keeping</text>
  <text start="421" dur="5.49">the illusion alive and many people buy</text>
  <text start="424.9" dur="3.86">into the illusion that everything is</text>
  <text start="426.49" dur="4.44">okay but those people that are laid off</text>
  <text start="428.76" dur="3.7">who believe that the</text>
  <text start="430.93" dur="3.12">rate is f four-point-seven percent are</text>
  <text start="432.46" dur="3.69">scratching their heads why can&amp;#39;t I find</text>
  <text start="434.05" dur="4.8">out the job those people that are</text>
  <text start="436.15" dur="4.65">employed and it continually receiving a</text>
  <text start="438.85" dur="7.68">paycheck they believe that everything is</text>
  <text start="440.8" dur="8.459">fine until everything is not now we</text>
  <text start="446.53" dur="4.949">realize that there&amp;#39;s a lot of people out</text>
  <text start="449.259" dur="7.171">there who are nervous about the economy</text>
  <text start="451.479" dur="8.91">and we are starting to see that gold and</text>
  <text start="456.43" dur="6.269">silver sales they are increasing we see</text>
  <text start="460.389" dur="5.331">the Canadian Silver Maple Leaf it has</text>
  <text start="462.699" dur="6.391">surged in the first quarter of 2016 and</text>
  <text start="465.72" dur="6.72">they&amp;#39;ve just made a new record the mints</text>
  <text start="469.09" dur="5.82">sold a stunning 10.6 million ounces a</text>
  <text start="472.44" dur="6.61">twenty-seven percent increase over the</text>
  <text start="474.91" dur="10.229">sales from the first quarter of 2015 now</text>
  <text start="479.05" dur="8.97">we&amp;#39;re also seeing that they sold 1</text>
  <text start="485.139" dur="5.96">million ounces more than their all-time</text>
  <text start="488.02" dur="7.86">record seen in the third quarter of 2015</text>
  <text start="491.099" dur="7.421">so sales of gold and silver they are up</text>
  <text start="495.88" dur="8.159">nearly twenty percent this year over</text>
  <text start="498.52" dur="8.579">last and we we understand why people are</text>
  <text start="504.039" dur="5.13">looking at the economy and slowly but</text>
  <text start="507.099" dur="7.38">surely they&amp;#39;re purchasing gold and</text>
  <text start="509.169" dur="6.93">silver to protect their wealth and when</text>
  <text start="514.479" dur="2.94">we look at these economic indicators we</text>
  <text start="516.099" dur="6.301">see that things are rapidly falling</text>
  <text start="517.419" dur="10.351">apart Ralph Lauren well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="522.4" dur="6.48">expecting a double-digit decline the</text>
  <text start="527.77" dur="3.36">company is going to be laying off a</text>
  <text start="528.88" dur="4.32">thousand workers or about eight percent</text>
  <text start="531.13" dur="5.91">of its full-time staff they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="533.2" dur="6.17">be closing stores and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="537.04" dur="4.95">see a lot of this from the retailers</text>
  <text start="539.37" dur="5.29">where they&amp;#39;re saying sales aren&amp;#39;t where</text>
  <text start="541.99" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re supposed to be and this is</text>
  <text start="544.66" dur="4.77">another indicator of how the economies</text>
  <text start="547.54" dur="6.66">are falling apart because when economies</text>
  <text start="549.43" dur="9.029">fall apart things contract we see the</text>
  <text start="554.2" dur="6.21">American worker productivity well it is</text>
  <text start="558.459" dur="5.011">fallen in the first quarter down by</text>
  <text start="560.41" dur="4.26">point six percent this is the weakest to</text>
  <text start="563.47" dur="3.77">quarter tumble in</text>
  <text start="564.67" dur="6.18">productivity since the fourth quarter of</text>
  <text start="567.24" dur="8.08">2012 this is the third quarterly drop in</text>
  <text start="570.85" dur="8.67">output in a row and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="575.32" dur="8.58">America well it&amp;#39;s in trouble because</text>
  <text start="579.52" dur="8.85">productivity is dead in the water and it</text>
  <text start="583.9" dur="9">doesn&amp;#39;t look good factory orders they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="588.37" dur="8.22">continually slowly contracting and in</text>
  <text start="592.9" dur="7.35">April of 2016 orders fell by 2.7% from</text>
  <text start="596.59" dur="6.6">April of 2015 and the cumulative total</text>
  <text start="600.25" dur="5.88">for the first four months of this year</text>
  <text start="603.19" dur="6.18">was two-point-three percent less than</text>
  <text start="606.13" dur="6.15">the same months the year before now</text>
  <text start="609.37" dur="7.83">factory orders they have been in</text>
  <text start="612.28" dur="9.12">contraction for 18 months this is</text>
  <text start="617.2" dur="7.2">incredible and that is four months</text>
  <text start="621.4" dur="5.88">longer then during the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="624.4" dur="7.8">and also two months longer than the</text>
  <text start="627.28" dur="6.72">dot-com recession so the president the</text>
  <text start="632.2" dur="4.44">Fed they&amp;#39;re trying to tell us that</text>
  <text start="634" dur="5.64">everything is okay but from the evidence</text>
  <text start="636.64" dur="5.31">from the facts everything is not the</text>
  <text start="639.64" dur="5.91">Baltic Dry Index it is fallen by one</text>
  <text start="641.95" dur="5.58">point it&amp;#39;s down to 606 and something</text>
  <text start="645.55" dur="4.77">very interesting about the stock market</text>
  <text start="647.53" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re continually see the stocks moving</text>
  <text start="650.32" dur="4.2">up of course the corporate media is all</text>
  <text start="652.51" dur="3.93">over it they&amp;#39;re telling us how great the</text>
  <text start="654.52" dur="3.54">economy is doing look how great the</text>
  <text start="656.44" dur="3.3">stock market is going to be it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="658.06" dur="3.51">to continually go up and up and up it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="659.74" dur="3.75">never going to come down and actually if</text>
  <text start="661.57" dur="4.38">you go back to two thousand eight right</text>
  <text start="663.49" dur="6.93">before the stock market collapsed they</text>
  <text start="665.95" dur="7.11">said the same exact thing actually they</text>
  <text start="670.42" dur="7.11">said it about housing and guess what</text>
  <text start="673.06" dur="6.03">happened it all fell apart so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="677.53" dur="4.38">seeing at this point in time that</text>
  <text start="679.09" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;re getting desperate throughout</text>
  <text start="681.91" dur="6.78">last week anytime stocks have begun to</text>
  <text start="685.27" dur="6.62">correct or drop someone has bought the</text>
  <text start="688.69" dur="5.67">SP 500 futures to prop the market up</text>
  <text start="691.89" dur="4.62">three days in a row stocks opened down</text>
  <text start="694.36" dur="3.69">and someone immediately stepped in and</text>
  <text start="696.51" dur="6.79">began</text>
  <text start="698.05" dur="8.539">buying aggressively well this is a sign</text>
  <text start="703.3" dur="7.2">of manipulation because the buying halt</text>
  <text start="706.589" dur="7.151">almost the moment the stocks get to 2100</text>
  <text start="710.5" dur="6.089">on the sp500 at this point the</text>
  <text start="713.74" dur="6.05">manipulation ends and because there are</text>
  <text start="716.589" dur="5.881">a few real investors in the market today</text>
  <text start="719.79" dur="5.71">all of a sudden the market starts to</text>
  <text start="722.47" dur="8.07">retreat and we&amp;#39;ve been noticing this</text>
  <text start="725.5" dur="7.32">pattern very interesting because what</text>
  <text start="730.54" dur="5.549">the US government what the central banks</text>

  <text start="742.36" dur="5.669">deteriorating we know that things are</text>
  <text start="745" dur="4.529">rapidly falling apart and Obama he</text>
  <text start="748.029" dur="3.721">decided to take this to the next level</text>
  <text start="749.529" dur="4.471">because we have to remember the US</text>
  <text start="751.75" dur="5.13">government central bankers they really</text>
  <text start="754" dur="5.61">want to blame this on some other</text>
  <text start="756.88" dur="4.92">countries some other group and they want</text>
  <text start="759.61" dur="6.99">to provoke other countries and other</text>
  <text start="761.8" dur="8.09">groups into starting something so we can</text>
  <text start="766.6" dur="7.109">see right now the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="769.89" dur="9.759">decided to put a total ban on Chinese</text>

  <text start="779.649" dur="7.56">to seek china import ban and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="785.74" dur="3.69">to have to see what this is because</text>
  <text start="787.209" dur="4.711">we&amp;#39;re looking at trade wars right now we</text>
  <text start="789.43" dur="5.34">had had currency wars we&amp;#39;re into trade</text>
  <text start="791.92" dur="6.409">wars now and once we&amp;#39;re done with trade</text>
  <text start="794.77" dur="7.86">wars what happens we move into real war</text>
  <text start="798.329" dur="8.411">now the IMF they have confirmed a</text>
  <text start="802.63" dur="5.97">nightmare scenario and an Austrian</text>
  <text start="806.74" dur="4.01">central banker said that the ECB</text>
  <text start="808.6" dur="7.44">asset-backed security purchasing program</text>
  <text start="810.75" dur="10.209">hasn&amp;#39;t been successful as they&amp;#39;d hope so</text>
  <text start="816.04" dur="8.609">the ECB admitted that all of this that</text>
  <text start="820.959" dur="5.731">they&amp;#39;ve been doing does not work he said</text>
  <text start="824.649" dur="4.43">there&amp;#39;s simply not enough bonds to buy</text>
  <text start="826.69" dur="2.389">and</text>
  <text start="829.9" dur="6.33">the program&amp;#39;s many inherent absurdities</text>
  <text start="833.98" dur="4.23">are the glaring disparity between the</text>
  <text start="836.23" dur="5.1">size of the program and the amount of</text>
  <text start="838.21" dur="5.09">net euro fixed income issuance and the</text>
  <text start="841.33" dur="5.01">more nuanced fact that the effects of</text>
  <text start="843.3" dur="8.41">previous ECB easing efforts virtually</text>
  <text start="846.34" dur="7.95">ensure that QE cannot succeed and we</text>
  <text start="851.71" dur="5.52">know that QE does not help the everyday</text>
  <text start="854.29" dur="6.15">person we know that QE doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="857.23" dur="5.88">prompt the economy up QE props the</text>
  <text start="860.44" dur="5.85">bankers up props corporations up props</text>
  <text start="863.11" dur="6.48">the central bankers up props the elite</text>
  <text start="866.29" dur="6.02">up and leaves the rest of us scratching</text>
  <text start="869.59" dur="6.06">my head saying what just happened here</text>
  <text start="872.31" dur="8.08">now something big always happens right</text>
  <text start="875.65" dur="6.6">before an official recession and we</text>
  <text start="880.39" dur="7.95">talked about this before and its</text>
  <text start="882.25" dur="10.95">continuing and when temp jobs start to</text>
  <text start="888.34" dur="7.5">decline this is a signal and we talked</text>
  <text start="893.2" dur="5.94">about this a couple reports back and the</text>
  <text start="895.84" dur="10.56">temp job scenario well it&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="899.14" dur="9.66">declining and it&amp;#39;s accelerating so when</text>
  <text start="906.4" dur="5.04">we look at the temp jobs what do we say</text>
  <text start="908.8" dur="7.23">well in the last two recessions we saw</text>
  <text start="911.44" dur="7.23">the same exact pattern when economic</text>
  <text start="916.03" dur="4.95">conditions start to change temporary</text>
  <text start="918.67" dur="4.65">workers are often affected before anyone</text>
  <text start="920.98" dur="4.02">else why is that well temporary workers</text>
  <text start="923.32" dur="5.21">are easier to higher than other types of</text>
  <text start="925" dur="8.07">work and they&amp;#39;re also easier to fire in</text>
  <text start="928.53" dur="8.43">May the US economy lost another 21,000</text>
  <text start="933.07" dur="9.9">temporary jobs and overall we&amp;#39;ve lost</text>
  <text start="936.96" dur="9.49">64,000 temp jobs since December this is</text>
  <text start="942.97" dur="7.77">another indicator that the economy is</text>
  <text start="946.45" dur="6.24">collapsing and this is why everyone</text>
