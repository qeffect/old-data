  <text start="189.859" dur="2.671">States because the regulations will make</text>
  <text start="191.51" dur="3.839">it too expensive for you</text>
  <text start="192.53" dur="7.799">Trump is reversing all of this now as we</text>
  <text start="195.349" dur="8.911">know Trump he issued and announced more</text>
  <text start="200.329" dur="7.561">tariffs on China on August 23rd he</text>
  <text start="204.26" dur="6.36">placed 550 billion worth of Chinese</text>

  <text start="210.62" dur="6.36">move their operation out of China now</text>
  <text start="213.5" dur="5.669">China expert Frank Z believes that when</text>
  <text start="216.98" dur="4.17">the trade war has escalated to this</text>
  <text start="219.169" dur="5.25">level it will bring devastating</text>
  <text start="221.15" dur="5.489">consequences to Chinese economy but it</text>
  <text start="224.419" dur="4.35">will not have a major impact on the</text>
  <text start="226.639" dur="4.561">United States think about what is</text>
  <text start="228.769" dur="6.921">happening here by putting all this</text>
  <text start="231.2" dur="9.599">pressure on China China&amp;#39;s economy is</text>
  <text start="235.69" dur="7.35">going to decline rapidly now what is</text>
  <text start="240.799" dur="5.761">trying to be doing for a very long time</text>
  <text start="243.04" dur="5.89">they&amp;#39;ve been purchasing gold do you</text>
  <text start="246.56" dur="6.299">think they&amp;#39;ll be able to survive the</text>
  <text start="248.93" dur="6.059">economy crashing absolutely look at</text>
  <text start="252.859" dur="4.38">Russia what have they been doing for a</text>
  <text start="254.989" dur="5.78">very long time they&amp;#39;ve been accumulating</text>
  <text start="257.239" dur="9.11">a lot of gold this is their insurance</text>
  <text start="260.769" dur="8.261">policy trump ji putin they all know this</text>
  <text start="266.349" dur="7.181">yes there are deep state actors within</text>
  <text start="269.03" dur="6.359">China yes they do bad things but this is</text>
  <text start="273.53" dur="3.87">with every country their black sites</text>
  <text start="275.389" dur="4.701">everywhere this is what the deep state</text>
  <text start="277.4" dur="6.3">has been doing for a very long time and</text>
  <text start="280.09" dur="6.67">Trump he needs to push the</text>
  <text start="283.7" dur="5.13">agenda because they need to do two</text>
  <text start="286.76" dur="4.92">things they need to bring the companies</text>
  <text start="288.83" dur="7.35">back and they need to drive this central</text>
  <text start="291.68" dur="6.66">bank system to the edge remember right</text>
  <text start="296.18" dur="6.03">now the central bankers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="298.34" dur="8.46">completely exposed there&amp;#39;s nothing to</text>
  <text start="302.21" dur="6.68">hide behind there&amp;#39;s no event when</text>
  <text start="306.8" dur="4.98">everything goes south around the world</text>
  <text start="308.89" dur="5.68">they will to be blamed they&amp;#39;re the only</text>
  <text start="311.78" dur="5.12">ones that can be blamed it won&amp;#39;t be the</text>
  <text start="314.57" dur="4.74">trade wars it won&amp;#39;t be the tariffs</text>
  <text start="316.9" dur="4.96">because when all is said and done and</text>
  <text start="319.31" dur="5.19">the push to get the companies out of</text>
  <text start="321.86" dur="7.02">China has succeeded which it is</text>
  <text start="324.5" dur="5.4">succeeding Trump and G will finally make</text>
  <text start="328.88" dur="6.81">that deal remember</text>
  <text start="329.9" dur="9.54">timing is very very important now Trump</text>
  <text start="335.69" dur="8.37">confirm that yes companies now are</text>
  <text start="339.44" dur="6.57">moving out of China and he was speaking</text>
  <text start="344.06" dur="4.62">to reporters outside the White House on</text>
  <text start="346.01" dur="7.02">Friday before he left for Camp David and</text>
  <text start="348.68" dur="7.5">he said yes around 13% of US companies</text>
  <text start="353.03" dur="6.18">will be leaving China and doing business</text>
  <text start="356.18" dur="5.49">elsewhere now once they&amp;#39;re out of China</text>
  <text start="359.21" dur="5.31">we want to shift them and move them back</text>
  <text start="361.67" dur="6.03">to the United States Trump is shifting a</text>
  <text start="364.52" dur="4.68">lot of the manufacturing out of China</text>
  <text start="367.7" dur="3.99">and I believe this is the first step</text>
  <text start="369.2" dur="4.44">just to get them out of there and then</text>
  <text start="371.69" dur="3.99">eventually have them brought back to the</text>
  <text start="373.64" dur="8.86">United States take a listen to what</text>
  <text start="375.68" dur="9.64">Trump says starting to come out</text>
  <text start="382.5" dur="4.86">if you look at Chinese government China</text>
  <text start="385.32" dur="3.57">what they&amp;#39;ve done with tariffs is very</text>
  <text start="387.36" dur="4.44">interesting they&amp;#39;ve devalued their</text>
  <text start="388.89" dur="5.07">currency so much and which hurts them</text>
  <text start="391.8" dur="4.98">ultimately because some much fortify</text>
  <text start="393.96" dur="5.43">things outside of China but they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="396.78" dur="5.04">devalued so much it&amp;#39;s a bad situation</text>
  <text start="399.39" dur="6.9">that put themselves in and I just saw</text>
  <text start="401.82" dur="7.44">came over the wires that 13% of certain</text>
  <text start="406.29" dur="5.04">companies are going to be leaving China</text>
  <text start="409.26" dur="2.91">in the not-too-distant future that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="411.33" dur="4.59">big thing</text>
  <text start="412.17" dur="7.62">13% of companies will be leaving China</text>
  <text start="415.92" dur="5.25">in the fairly near future and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="419.79" dur="3.6">surprised to hear that I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="421.17" dur="5.22">going to be much higher now as you can</text>
  <text start="423.39" dur="4.49">see Trump confirmed that yes they</text>
  <text start="426.39" dur="4.5">already know that there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="427.88" dur="4.57">13% of the companies moving out of China</text>
  <text start="430.89" dur="4.77">now that are they all coming back to the</text>
  <text start="432.45" dur="6.51">United States no this is the first part</text>
  <text start="435.66" dur="5.1">of the plane just get them out of trying</text>
  <text start="438.96" dur="5.07">to make it too expensive for them to</text>
  <text start="440.76" dur="5.7">move back into China once these</text>
  <text start="444.03" dur="4.05">companies are out of China hopefully</text>
  <text start="446.46" dur="5.34">some of them do come back to the United</text>
  <text start="448.08" dur="6.39">States I think Trump once he has more</text>
  <text start="451.8" dur="4.83">control of the system and he&amp;#39;s gaining</text>
  <text start="454.47" dur="4.08">more and more control every single day I</text>
  <text start="456.63" dur="5.07">do believe he&amp;#39;s gonna start changing</text>
  <text start="458.55" dur="6.33">regulations easing regulations and</text>
  <text start="461.7" dur="4.68">making attractive for corporations and</text>
  <text start="464.88" dur="3.9">manufacturers to come back to the United</text>
  <text start="466.38" dur="4.53">States and if you listen to him he said</text>
  <text start="468.78" dur="4.53">this number most likely is going to be</text>
  <text start="470.91" dur="5.4">much much higher which I do believe I do</text>
  <text start="473.31" dur="5.609">believe they have a plan where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="476.31" dur="5.609">going to be very very attractive for all</text>
  <text start="478.919" dur="4.231">of these companies manufacturers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="481.919" dur="3.601">all going to be coming back to the</text>
  <text start="483.15" dur="4.95">United States because they&amp;#39;re gonna say</text>
  <text start="485.52" dur="6.2">wow look at the tax incentives look what</text>
  <text start="488.1" dur="7.02">we get here it&amp;#39;s definitely worth it</text>
  <text start="491.72" dur="5.92">he&amp;#39;s using everything the deep state the</text>
  <text start="495.12" dur="4.98">central banks have been using for a long</text>
  <text start="497.64" dur="4.62">time he&amp;#39;s just reversing it</text>
  <text start="500.1" dur="4.29">they added regulations he&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="502.26" dur="4.8">removing regulations he&amp;#39;s placing</text>
  <text start="504.39" dur="5.79">pressure on China they made it easy for</text>
  <text start="507.06" dur="5.21">China everything that he&amp;#39;s doing is the</text>
  <text start="510.18" dur="4.73">opposite of what they&amp;#39;ve been doing and</text>
  <text start="512.27" dur="4.26">he&amp;#39;s in a rush</text>
  <text start="514.91" dur="5.58">because he understands that the central</text>
  <text start="516.53" dur="6.99">bank system it is imploding he can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="520.49" dur="6.98">save it the Patriots have no intention</text>
  <text start="523.52" dur="6.27">of saving this illusionary economy</text>
  <text start="527.47" dur="6.58">they&amp;#39;re not keeping the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="529.79" dur="8.78">Note they&amp;#39;re going to have a sound money</text>
  <text start="534.05" dur="7.08">system it will no longer be a debt note</text>
  <text start="538.57" dur="5.91">when Trump is making this perfectly</text>
  <text start="541.13" dur="8.07">clear that his job the Patriots job is</text>
  <text start="544.48" dur="8.02">to have a system that actually works for</text>
  <text start="549.2" dur="3.93">the people and that is where we are</text>
