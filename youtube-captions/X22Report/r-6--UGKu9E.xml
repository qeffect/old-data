  <text start="122.719" dur="4.801">have the ability to move the market and</text>
  <text start="125.63" dur="3.359">we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking about that in a</text>
  <text start="127.52" dur="5.49">little bit but I wanted to start off</text>
  <text start="128.989" dur="7.351">with crypto currencies and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="133.01" dur="7.08">seeing right now is that the central</text>
  <text start="136.34" dur="6.179">banks they are making their move to take</text>
  <text start="140.09" dur="3.66">control of the cryptocurrency market now</text>
  <text start="142.519" dur="2.821">a lot of people who are not in the</text>
  <text start="143.75" dur="4.23">cryptocurrency market yeah I don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="145.34" dur="4.2">what&amp;#39;s the big deal let them take</text>
  <text start="147.98" dur="5.129">control of it it makes no difference to</text>
  <text start="149.54" dur="6">me well there&amp;#39;s always a reason why they</text>
  <text start="153.109" dur="5.341">want control actually Ken Rogoff former</text>
  <text start="155.54" dur="6.12">IMF chief economist and author of the</text>
  <text start="158.45" dur="5.879">curse of cash he wants to get rid of</text>
  <text start="161.66" dur="4.85">cash he&amp;#39;s saying that the government</text>
  <text start="164.329" dur="6.871">will eventually have to regulate</text>
  <text start="166.51" dur="8.02">cryptocurrency severely and issue its</text>
  <text start="171.2" dur="5.46">own digital currency now I do agree with</text>
  <text start="174.53" dur="3.57">them that the government because in sin</text>
  <text start="176.66" dur="5.28">there are continents in our constitution</text>
  <text start="178.1" dur="7.05">where the government will coin their own</text>
  <text start="181.94" dur="4.26">currency issue their own digital</text>
  <text start="185.15" dur="4.229">currency</text>
  <text start="186.2" dur="6.96">for the nation what I disagree with is</text>
  <text start="189.379" dur="6.36">the central bank taking control of that</text>
  <text start="193.16" dur="6.659">because there was a time where the</text>
  <text start="195.739" dur="6.72">United States was creating its own coin</text>
  <text start="199.819" dur="4.411">and issuing it to the public then the</text>
  <text start="202.459" dur="4.89">central bank took over and they&amp;#39;ve tried</text>
  <text start="204.23" dur="6.24">many times central bank one central bank</text>
  <text start="207.349" dur="6.331">to and then the Federal Reserve and we</text>
  <text start="210.47" dur="6.42">see the central banks of central banks</text>
  <text start="213.68" dur="5.73">the biz they&amp;#39;re out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="216.89" dur="6.12">saying that central banks must be</text>
  <text start="219.41" dur="6.48">prepared to intervene to stem risks from</text>
  <text start="223.01" dur="5.759">digital currencies as Bitcoin has become</text>
  <text start="225.89" dur="6">a combination of a bubble a Ponzi scheme</text>
  <text start="228.769" dur="4.381">and an environmental disaster I mean</text>
  <text start="231.89" dur="3.15">pretty much what the central banks do</text>
  <text start="233.15" dur="4.29">they create currency out of thin air</text>
  <text start="235.04" dur="5.19">they create bubbles around the world</text>
  <text start="237.44" dur="4.829">they put everyone into debt and they</text>
  <text start="240.23" dur="5.55">create more and more currency from the</text>
  <text start="242.269" dur="6.121">banks out of thin air and it&amp;#39;s a Ponzi</text>
  <text start="245.78" dur="4.26">scheme where they just keep transferring</text>
  <text start="248.39" dur="3.42">funds all over the place really they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="250.04" dur="4.319">talking about themselves and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="251.81" dur="4.59">want another system going up against</text>
  <text start="254.359" dur="4.801">their system the difference is the</text>
  <text start="256.4" dur="6.989">cryptocurrencies the currency is created</text>
  <text start="259.16" dur="6.12">without interest attached and what</text>
  <text start="263.389" dur="4.891">they&amp;#39;re saying right now they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="265.28" dur="6.24">that they should have the public</text>
  <text start="268.28" dur="5.49">authorities move to crack down on</text>
  <text start="271.52" dur="5.07">digital currencies because they are</text>
  <text start="273.77" dur="6.06">concerned that it could undermine the</text>
  <text start="276.59" dur="5.01">broader financial system they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="279.83" dur="3.63">cryptocurrencies piggyback on the</text>
  <text start="281.6" dur="4.8">institutional infrastructure that serves</text>
  <text start="283.46" dur="6.54">the wider financial system gaining a</text>
  <text start="286.4" dur="7.59">semblance of legitimacy from their links</text>
  <text start="290" dur="7.889">to it and what they&amp;#39;re saying is they</text>
  <text start="293.99" dur="6.63">don&amp;#39;t want this system to override their</text>
  <text start="297.889" dur="5.4">system they&amp;#39;re very nervous about this</text>
  <text start="300.62" dur="5.34">they don&amp;#39;t want another currency going</text>
  <text start="303.289" dur="5.041">up against their currency and what</text>
  <text start="305.96" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re really saying here is they need</text>
  <text start="308.33" dur="5.04">to stop it now the name of the game is</text>
  <text start="311.15" dur="4.38">control and this is what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="313.37" dur="5.669">to be pushing for so we have two things</text>
  <text start="315.53" dur="4.73">happening right now we have the dollar</text>
  <text start="319.039" dur="3.811">system that we</text>
  <text start="320.26" dur="4.96">understand today we understand what it</text>
  <text start="322.85" dur="5.67">is we understand how it was created how</text>
  <text start="325.22" dur="6.48">they keep it going that is dying the</text>
  <text start="328.52" dur="6.39">petrodollar system is dying they want to</text>
  <text start="331.7" dur="5.61">move to a brand new system where they</text>
  <text start="334.91" dur="5.28">can pretty much get rid of the old debt</text>
  <text start="337.31" dur="6.33">start a new system make everyone believe</text>
  <text start="340.19" dur="5.85">that it&amp;#39;s stable it&amp;#39;s backed or there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.64" dur="4.11">confidence with gold to show people that</text>
  <text start="346.04" dur="4.56">and other countries around the world</text>
  <text start="347.75" dur="5.19">that everything&amp;#39;s ok then we have the</text>
  <text start="350.6" dur="5.39">cryptocurrency system where governments</text>
  <text start="352.94" dur="6.39">without the central banks can basically</text>
  <text start="355.99" dur="5.88">create their own coin issue it and say</text>
  <text start="359.33" dur="6.39">this is the currency of the country and</text>
  <text start="361.87" dur="5.59">this would be a people&amp;#39;s currency this</text>
  <text start="365.72" dur="4.02">is what the central bankers don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="367.46" dur="5.01">to happen because if it does happen this</text>
  <text start="369.74" dur="4.98">way we don&amp;#39;t need the banking system we</text>
  <text start="372.47" dur="4.05">don&amp;#39;t need the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="374.72" dur="5.07">cryptocurrency is issued without</text>
  <text start="376.52" dur="6.3">interest so if we put one coin out there</text>
  <text start="379.79" dur="6.75">all we need is one coin back to balance</text>
  <text start="382.82" dur="8.21">the books today the central bankers</text>
  <text start="386.54" dur="7.35">issue one dollar and we need a dollar 25</text>
  <text start="391.03" dur="5.98">to give back to them but how do you do</text>
  <text start="393.89" dur="5.13">that the 25 cents doesn&amp;#39;t exist the 25</text>
  <text start="397.01" dur="2.85">cents represents interest it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="399.02" dur="4.08">exist</text>
  <text start="399.86" dur="5.07">so the central banks create more</text>
  <text start="403.1" dur="6.12">currency and the government&amp;#39;s borrow it</text>
  <text start="404.93" dur="6.12">and this game goes on over and over and</text>
  <text start="409.22" dur="4.14">over and continually puts government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="411.05" dur="5.73">the people into debt and the central</text>
  <text start="413.36" dur="5.66">bankers take control this is what the</text>
  <text start="416.78" dur="4.62">central banking system is all about and</text>
  <text start="419.02" dur="4.54">we can see they&amp;#39;re trying to make their</text>
  <text start="421.4" dur="3.36">move right now to control the system</text>
  <text start="423.56" dur="1.47">because they can see what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="424.76" dur="2.85">here</text>
  <text start="425.03" dur="4.23">more more countries are moving away from</text>
  <text start="427.61" dur="3.33">the dollar more and more countries are</text>
  <text start="429.26" dur="3.21">saying you know something we don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="430.94" dur="3.66">need the central bank currency we can</text>
  <text start="432.47" dur="4.44">create our own currency just like</text>
  <text start="434.6" dur="4.23">Venezuela and we can use the petros</text>
  <text start="436.91" dur="3.84">which is a crypto currency and we could</text>
  <text start="438.83" dur="2.94">sell our oil to other countries and we</text>
  <text start="440.75" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t have to go through any banking</text>
  <text start="441.77" dur="4.47">system and it&amp;#39;s beautiful and the money</text>
  <text start="444.86" dur="3.33">is deposited right away</text>
  <text start="446.24" dur="4.59">we don&amp;#39;t even have to wait it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="448.19" dur="4.74">fantastic and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="450.83" dur="2.91">worried about at this point now looking</text>
  <text start="452.93" dur="4.32">at the</text>
  <text start="453.74" dur="5.91">economy the economy is in a huge amount</text>
  <text start="457.25" dur="4.83">of trouble even though the corporate</text>
  <text start="459.65" dur="4.23">media the government the Fed is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="462.08" dur="3.239">all telling us that things are okay</text>
  <text start="463.88" dur="4.11">parts of the corporate media right now</text>
  <text start="465.319" dur="3.511">are taking on the idea that the economy</text>
  <text start="467.99" dur="3">is not doing well</text>
  <text start="468.83" dur="4.2">and they&amp;#39;re pushing that a little bit at</text>
  <text start="470.99" dur="4.649">this point but we&amp;#39;re looking at another</text>
  <text start="473.03" dur="5.639">indicator and this is the December jolt</text>
  <text start="475.639" dur="5.911">report and this is the favorite labor</text>
  <text start="478.669" dur="5.28">market indicator of now former Fed chair</text>
  <text start="481.55" dur="4.89">Yellen because now we know there&amp;#39;s a new</text>
  <text start="483.949" dur="5.28">Fed chair that was just introduced into</text>
  <text start="486.44" dur="5.28">the system and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="489.229" dur="5.761">we&amp;#39;re starting to see the exact same</text>
  <text start="491.72" dur="8.129">signs that we saw back in 2006 going</text>
  <text start="494.99" dur="7.679">into 2007 where they&amp;#39;re saying that job</text>
  <text start="499.849" dur="5.461">openings well they&amp;#39;re declining right</text>
  <text start="502.669" dur="6">now total hires are declining as well</text>
  <text start="505.31" dur="6.509">and both are starting to fall at the</text>
  <text start="508.669" dur="6.06">same exact time we&amp;#39;re worse we saw this</text>
  <text start="511.819" dur="4.89">back in 2006-2007 this is when</text>
  <text start="514.729" dur="7.141">everything rolled over and we entered</text>
  <text start="516.709" dur="7.411">into a scenario where we were in this</text>
  <text start="521.87" dur="5.159">recession heading towards a Great</text>
  <text start="524.12" dur="7.68">Depression to a collapse and this</text>
  <text start="527.029" dur="8.011">started in 2006 dropped to 2007 when it</text>
  <text start="531.8" dur="7.7">hit 2008 it came down very quickly we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="535.04" dur="6.9">at the point right now around 2007 and</text>
  <text start="539.5" dur="4.57">we&amp;#39;re gonna start to see this fall off</text>
  <text start="541.94" dur="5.43">quite a bit and it&amp;#39;s going to head down</text>
  <text start="544.07" dur="5.85">very very quickly and they realize this</text>
  <text start="547.37" dur="4.86">they understand that this economy that</text>
  <text start="549.92" dur="6.409">we&amp;#39;re in right now is built on one</text>
  <text start="552.23" dur="9.84">gigantic illusion now goldman exposes</text>
  <text start="556.329" dur="8.231">the wage growth illusion now in a report</text>
  <text start="562.07" dur="5.43">that they put out there they said that</text>
  <text start="564.56" dur="3.51">wage growth is actually not rising at</text>
  <text start="567.5" dur="3.209">all</text>
  <text start="568.07" dur="4.98">wage growth is slowing now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="570.709" dur="5.25">following this for quite a while and yes</text>
  <text start="573.05" dur="5.49">we have seen this before where the wages</text>
  <text start="575.959" dur="5.101">are continually declining they started</text>
  <text start="578.54" dur="5.64">to decline rapidly after the financial</text>
  <text start="581.06" dur="5.86">crisis they never improved and this is</text>
  <text start="584.18" dur="6.219">very difficult for the Fed to push</text>
  <text start="586.92" dur="5.94">the idea of increasing wages it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="590.399" dur="5.43">difficult for the Fed to make people go</text>
  <text start="592.86" dur="5.219">out and purchase goods and help build</text>
  <text start="595.829" dur="4.38">retail these are the things they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="598.079" dur="4.591">control they can control anything that</text>
  <text start="600.209" dur="4.891">has to do with borrowing or statistical</text>
  <text start="602.67" dur="3.659">numbers of course so if you need to</text>
  <text start="605.1" dur="3.479">borrow for an auto loan</text>
  <text start="606.329" dur="5.041">no problem housing no problem they can</text>
  <text start="608.579" dur="5.161">push these bubbles up countries</text>
  <text start="611.37" dur="4.44">borrowing money no problem they can push</text>
  <text start="613.74" dur="4.17">that bump those bubbles up the</text>
  <text start="615.81" dur="5.13">government borrowing money no problem</text>
  <text start="617.91" dur="4.53">they can do everything like that that</text>
  <text start="620.94" dur="2.79">has to do with borrowing because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="622.44" dur="3.48">what they&amp;#39;re all about putting people in</text>
  <text start="623.73" dur="4.62">the dead the thing that they can&amp;#39;t do is</text>
  <text start="625.92" dur="5.159">they can&amp;#39;t make people make more money</text>
  <text start="628.35" dur="5.16">and they can&amp;#39;t make people get better</text>
  <text start="631.079" dur="5.731">jobs they can&amp;#39;t make people go out and</text>
  <text start="633.51" dur="6.06">spend more money in retail and this is</text>
  <text start="636.81" dur="5.31">where we see the real economy they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="639.57" dur="5.04">make manufacturing produce more they</text>
  <text start="642.12" dur="3.99">can&amp;#39;t do any of this stuff and this is</text>
  <text start="644.61" dur="4.65">where it breaks down this is where we</text>
  <text start="646.11" dur="5.55">see the real economy and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="649.26" dur="4.829">seeing right now is wages are declining</text>
  <text start="651.66" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;re at the back end of the system we</text>
  <text start="654.089" dur="3.841">saw the system rise in the 70s when we</text>
  <text start="656.76" dur="2.88">came off the gold standard we had a</text>
  <text start="657.93" dur="4.08">little bit of debt and now we&amp;#39;re on the</text>
  <text start="659.64" dur="4.74">back end of the system that where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="662.01" dur="4.71">in a lot of debt wages of declining back</text>
  <text start="664.38" dur="4.47">in the 70s wages increased there was</text>
  <text start="666.72" dur="4.83">inflation they were creating currency</text>
  <text start="668.85" dur="4.859">debt was very low now we have a lot of</text>
  <text start="671.55" dur="5.21">debt the interest rates have to go to</text>
  <text start="673.709" dur="5.911">zero or negative and wages are declining</text>
  <text start="676.76" dur="4.12">because the system&amp;#39;s breaking down this</text>

  <text start="888.21" dur="5.52">we know that to to bring the market back</text>
  <text start="891.51" dur="5.73">up the plunge protection team needs to</text>

  <text start="928.59" dur="5.37">there is a huge battle going on right</text>
  <text start="931.86" dur="3.72">now but what&amp;#39;s very interesting is the</text>
  <text start="933.96" dur="6.96">White House didn&amp;#39;t really say that much</text>
  <text start="935.58" dur="8.43">about the market and he did say that he</text>
  <text start="940.92" dur="6.81">is now focusing on the economy&amp;#39;s long</text>

  <text start="947.73" dur="2.97">took responsibility for the market</text>
  <text start="949.35" dur="4.05">because he had control of the market and</text>
  <text start="950.7" dur="6.06">he just realized that and I think those</text>
  <text start="953.4" dur="7.02">individuals in around him that are</text>
  <text start="956.76" dur="5.31">working with him realized that they also</text>
  <text start="960.42" dur="4.41">and I&amp;#39;m talking about the deep state the</text>
  <text start="962.07" dur="6.57">central banks have the ability to shift</text>
  <text start="964.83" dur="6.33">things shift the market shift the entire</text>
  <text start="968.64" dur="6.15">economic system at a moment&amp;#39;s notice</text>
  <text start="971.16" dur="6.63">and I do believe this was a message that</text>
  <text start="974.79" dur="6.23">was sent saying listen you stop what</text>
  <text start="977.79" dur="7.98">you&amp;#39;re doing stop the investigations</text>
  <text start="981.02" dur="6.86">stop everything and we need control once</text>
  <text start="985.77" dur="5.13">again now</text>
  <text start="987.88" dur="6.45">is it going to work most likely not</text>
  <text start="990.9" dur="7.23">because what we see right now is there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="994.33" dur="7.38">this huge fight between two groups</text>
  <text start="998.13" dur="5.68">trying to control what is going on here</text>
  <text start="1001.71" dur="5.22">the deep state of course the central</text>
  <text start="1003.81" dur="4.23">bank&amp;#39;s they want control back they want</text>
  <text start="1006.93" dur="2.85">full control back</text>
  <text start="1008.04" dur="4.26">they don&amp;#39;t have full control right now</text>
  <text start="1009.78" dur="3.87">they have partial control the Trump</text>
  <text start="1012.3" dur="3.51">administration those Patriots behind</text>
  <text start="1013.65" dur="4.41">they have partial control of the</text>
  <text start="1015.81" dur="5.28">economic system of the country of those</text>
  <text start="1018.06" dur="5.49">people in government and the take away</text>
  <text start="1021.09" dur="5.64">of all this is that you need to</text>
  <text start="1023.55" dur="5.13">understand there&amp;#39;s going to be two</text>
  <text start="1026.73" dur="5.459">different types of collapses depending</text>
  <text start="1028.68" dur="5.85">on who gains the narrative of how the</text>
  <text start="1032.189" dur="5.101">system comes down because the system</text>
  <text start="1034.53" dur="5.25">can&amp;#39;t go on it&amp;#39;s breaking apart every</text>

  <text start="1039.78" dur="3.929">seeing problems all over the place and</text>
  <text start="1041.64" dur="4.26">we see already the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1051.9" dur="5.88">the central bank&amp;#39;s the deep state they</text>
  <text start="1055.71" dur="4.08">don&amp;#39;t care how hard they bring it down</text>

  <text start="1062.58" dur="6.75">everyone afraid and this is how fast it</text>
  <text start="1065.19" dur="6.83">can come down if they gain the control</text>
  <text start="1069.33" dur="5.82">of the narrative they will bring it down</text>
  <text start="1072.02" dur="4.78">fast and hard people will not even know</text>
  <text start="1075.15" dur="2.97">what hit them and this is why I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
