  <text start="165.38" dur="6.96">great place to do it and to meet other</text>
  <text start="169.22" dur="5.04">people who feel the same way okay let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="172.34" dur="5.009">get started with the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="174.26" dur="6.42">news we know Ben Bernanke has you know</text>
  <text start="177.349" dur="6.681">been testifying the stock market hurrah</text>
  <text start="180.68" dur="5.61">is at the all-time highs and</text>
  <text start="184.03" dur="7.9">everything&amp;#39;s going up everything looks</text>
  <text start="186.29" dur="9.6">fantastic and to the normal person out</text>
  <text start="191.93" dur="6.899">there who is just going to work every</text>
  <text start="195.89" dur="5.64">day just looking at the newspaper the</text>
  <text start="198.829" dur="6.66">mainstream media everything looks</text>
  <text start="201.53" dur="6.45">fantastic to them everything seems great</text>
  <text start="205.489" dur="5.881">the economy seems great real estate</text>
  <text start="207.98" dur="7.92">seems great everything is great but when</text>
  <text start="211.37" dur="7.35">you push away the smoke and you look</text>
  <text start="215.9" dur="6.63">past the fog you see something</text>
  <text start="218.72" dur="11.519">completely different and if you look</text>
  <text start="222.53" dur="11.19">over in Greece this always astounds me</text>
  <text start="230.239" dur="5.911">when I see this now Greece is looking to</text>
  <text start="233.72" dur="6.629">get more debt and that&amp;#39;s the way I look</text>
  <text start="236.15" dur="5.82">at it they want like 9.2 billion dollars</text>
  <text start="240.349" dur="4.711">worth of more debt you know give me some</text>
  <text start="241.97" dur="7.95">more debt so to get that debt what we</text>
  <text start="245.06" dur="8.07">will do is we will get rid of 25,000</text>
  <text start="249.92" dur="6.24">public sector workers by the end of the</text>
  <text start="253.13" dur="6.69">year so this way we can add on 9.2</text>
  <text start="256.16" dur="6.42">billion have interest payments on this</text>
  <text start="259.82" dur="4.83">debt that we can&amp;#39;t meet and we will get</text>
  <text start="262.58" dur="4.5">rid of the workers and these workers</text>
  <text start="264.65" dur="3.98">will have to find something else and if</text>
  <text start="267.08" dur="3.53">they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="268.63" dur="3.66">and they&amp;#39;ll have no more disposable</text>
  <text start="270.61" dur="5.76">income they won&amp;#39;t be able to pay their</text>
  <text start="272.29" dur="9.36">rent and you know they will not be able</text>
  <text start="276.37" dur="7.83">to give back into society and this will</text>
  <text start="281.65" dur="6">cause more problems and I always find it</text>
  <text start="284.2" dur="7.08">fascinating what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="287.65" dur="8.7">achieve here I mean really think about</text>
  <text start="291.28" dur="8.07">this in your in your your household</text>
  <text start="296.35" dur="4.83">finances right now you want twenty</text>
  <text start="299.35" dur="3.9">thousand dollars more debt so you go to</text>
  <text start="301.18" dur="4.38">the bank and the bank says okay to get</text>
  <text start="303.25" dur="5.55">this debt of twenty thousand dollars</text>
  <text start="305.56" dur="8.1">what I need you to do is cut your salary</text>
  <text start="308.8" dur="6.72">in half would you do it or what I need</text>
  <text start="313.66" dur="7.65">you to do to get this more debt is get</text>
  <text start="315.52" dur="9.9">rid of one car if you have to it just</text>
  <text start="321.31" dur="7.26">seems kind of ridiculous and it makes no</text>
  <text start="325.42" dur="4.71">sense whatsoever how this is going to</text>
  <text start="328.57" dur="4.59">help it will sustain them for a little</text>
  <text start="330.13" dur="4.95">while but just as we&amp;#39;ve seen they</text>
  <text start="333.16" dur="3.81">continually need more debt because what</text>
  <text start="335.08" dur="4.29">happens is if you continually pile on</text>
  <text start="336.97" dur="3.81">debt you have more and more interest</text>
  <text start="339.37" dur="3.69">payments and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just like a</text>
  <text start="340.78" dur="4.83">family who continually makes a certain</text>
  <text start="343.06" dur="4.8">amount of income continually takes out</text>
  <text start="345.61" dur="4.23">credit cards and continually has higher</text>
  <text start="347.86" dur="5.7">and higher credit card payments higher</text>
  <text start="349.84" dur="6.12">higher debt at the end you no longer</text>
  <text start="353.56" dur="5.55">consist ain&amp;#39;t it no matter what you do</text>
  <text start="355.96" dur="5.34">you can sell all your assets and cut</text>
  <text start="359.11" dur="9.24">back as much as you want but you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="361.3" dur="9.06">always need more now I know that gold</text>
  <text start="368.35" dur="3.54">and silver that&amp;#39;s been rising again and</text>
  <text start="370.36" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;ve been smacked down and they rise</text>
  <text start="371.89" dur="4.29">again but they&amp;#39;ve been bathe</text>
  <text start="374.32" dur="3.69">realistically that they&amp;#39;ve been pushed</text>
  <text start="376.18" dur="4.32">down quite a bit but what&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="378.01" dur="4.59">is the u.s. mint is reporting that</text>
  <text start="380.5" dur="5.64">twenty seven point six million silver</text>
  <text start="382.6" dur="7.11">eagles are sold in July and this is</text>
  <text start="386.14" dur="6.3">about twenty seven point six million</text>
  <text start="389.71" dur="6.56">ounces I should say and if we look at</text>
  <text start="392.44" dur="9.04">this chart here a month previous to July</text>
  <text start="396.27" dur="8.39">there was only 3.2 million L</text>
  <text start="401.48" dur="7.05">is sold and now in July its twenty seven</text>
  <text start="404.66" dur="5.73">point six million ounces so where are</text>
  <text start="408.53" dur="4.8">people putting their money they are</text>
  <text start="410.39" dur="8.06">putting it in an insurance policy which</text>
  <text start="413.33" dur="10.04">is precious metals now talking about</text>
  <text start="418.45" dur="11.8">insurance policy savings the American</text>
  <text start="423.37" dur="10.15">person savers have lost about ten point</text>
  <text start="430.25" dur="7.26">eight trillion dollars in the bank since</text>
  <text start="433.52" dur="6.03">there&amp;#39;s really no interest so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="437.51" dur="3.96">really seeing a negative effect</text>
  <text start="439.55" dur="4.59">especially with inflation going up and</text>
  <text start="441.47" dur="5.99">no interest in the banks so they really</text>
  <text start="444.14" dur="7.47">lost around ten point eight trillion in</text>
  <text start="447.46" dur="7.71">earn interest on their accounts and we</text>
  <text start="451.61" dur="9.27">can look at this in two different ways</text>
  <text start="455.17" dur="8.35">the Fed is keeping interest low and is</text>
  <text start="460.88" dur="5.19">he keeping it low because he&amp;#39;s made he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="463.52" dur="4.71">done this before he where he dares</text>
  <text start="466.07" dur="3.69">people to get into the stock market and</text>
  <text start="468.23" dur="4.35">he wants people to get into the stock</text>
  <text start="469.76" dur="5.04">market if the interest rate is low in</text>
  <text start="472.58" dur="5.34">the savings account and people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="474.8" dur="6.06">making money on their money and they see</text>
  <text start="477.92" dur="6.57">the stock market continually rising</text>
  <text start="480.86" dur="5.73">every day where are people going to take</text>
  <text start="484.49" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re going to where are people going</text>
  <text start="486.59" dur="7.44">to put their money into the market and I</text>
  <text start="490.46" dur="6.69">believe that this is the end game of</text>
  <text start="494.03" dur="4.5">what he wants and he&amp;#39;s not coming out</text>
  <text start="497.15" dur="2.52">and just saying you know I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="498.53" dur="3.39">give you zero percent interest in your</text>
  <text start="499.67" dur="4.95">savings so put it in the market he wants</text>
  <text start="501.92" dur="5.37">people of course to make this decision</text>
  <text start="504.62" dur="6.06">themselves but he&amp;#39;s helping them make</text>
  <text start="507.29" dur="4.95">this decision by funding the banks of 85</text>
  <text start="510.68" dur="4.43">billion dollars a month where the banks</text>
  <text start="512.24" dur="5.16">were propping up the equity market and</text>
  <text start="515.11" dur="4.36">people are seeing this and those people</text>
  <text start="517.4" dur="3.449">who are sleeping saying hey why should I</text>
  <text start="519.47" dur="3.33">keep my money in the bank if I&amp;#39;m only</text>
  <text start="520.849" dur="3.901">getting one percent or a half a</text>
  <text start="522.8" dur="4.17">percentage I&amp;#39;ll put it in the market and</text>
  <text start="524.75" dur="4.08">I can get you know five or six percent</text>
  <text start="526.97" dur="3.21">yeah it&amp;#39;s a little bit more risky but I</text>
  <text start="528.83" dur="3.42">haven&amp;#39;t seen the market really go down</text>
  <text start="530.18" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s just been rising over and over and</text>
  <text start="532.25" dur="4.88">over and my financial adviser who knows</text>
  <text start="534.92" dur="4.59">absolutely nothing is telling me that</text>
  <text start="537.13" dur="6.19">this is a good place to put your money</text>
  <text start="539.51" dur="7.46">because look in the last since 2008 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="543.32" dur="8.579">only gone up it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s fantastic and</text>
  <text start="546.97" dur="9.309">this seems like this is the central</text>
  <text start="551.899" dur="5.971">bankers plan to get everyone in and then</text>
  <text start="556.279" dur="4.291">pull it out from under them and</text>
  <text start="557.87" dur="4.98">everything will be lost they will make</text>
  <text start="560.57" dur="5.28">the money but everyone else will lose</text>
  <text start="562.85" dur="5.729">their money now I know the jobs numbers</text>
  <text start="565.85" dur="5.06">have come out and everyone has always</text>
  <text start="568.579" dur="4.2">been saying that this can&amp;#39;t be the right</text>
  <text start="570.91" dur="3.52">calculation for unemployment because</text>
  <text start="572.779" dur="3.841">they&amp;#39;ve changed the calculation just</text>
  <text start="574.43" dur="5.01">like GDP inflation they actually even</text>
  <text start="576.62" dur="6.079">change the gauge of how many people they</text>
  <text start="579.44" dur="8.37">need they used to be 150 and now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="582.699" dur="8.771">85,000 that to show that the economy is</text>
  <text start="587.81" dur="9.029">growing in the jobs but interestingly</text>
  <text start="591.47" dur="7.83">enough the the be at the the job numbers</text>
  <text start="596.839" dur="6.18">RBS of course we all know that but</text>
  <text start="599.3" dur="8.07">people who are not awake do not know</text>
  <text start="603.019" dur="9.921">this and the former head of the BLS says</text>
  <text start="607.37" dur="12.06">yes these job numbers are BS and John</text>
  <text start="612.94" dur="10.329">crudele is coming out and I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="619.43" dur="10.529">Keith Hall of former head of the BLS is</text>
  <text start="623.269" dur="10.981">coming out and saying that the job</text>
  <text start="629.959" dur="8.94">numbers are misleading and this goes on</text>
  <text start="634.25" dur="7.709">to say that Keith Hall says he believes</text>
  <text start="638.899" dur="6.471">a true reading of those now wanting a</text>
  <text start="641.959" dur="11.041">job but without one to me more than ten</text>
  <text start="645.37" dur="10.36">percent and he goes on to say that the</text>
  <text start="653" dur="4.079">level hole that the level tells hole</text>
  <text start="655.73" dur="3.75">that the real unemployment rate is</text>
  <text start="657.079" dur="5.37">actually about 3 percentage points</text>
  <text start="659.48" dur="5.43">higher than the BSL number if the</text>
  <text start="662.449" dur="4.591">jobless rate is on it unacceptable at</text>
  <text start="664.91" dur="3.58">seven point six percent he&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="667.04" dur="3.79">shockingly bad if he</text>
  <text start="668.49" dur="6.48">right and the true rate is ten percent</text>
  <text start="670.83" dur="7.28">ten point six percent and he goes on to</text>
  <text start="674.97" dur="6.059">say this has been a very slow very bad</text>
  <text start="678.11" dur="5.169">recovery and I think the numbers have</text>
  <text start="681.029" dur="4.741">really struggled as a result in fact</text>
  <text start="683.279" dur="4.891">I&amp;#39;ve been very disappointed in the</text>
  <text start="685.77" dur="5.84">coverage of the numbers and what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="688.17" dur="6.06">saying is that these numbers are</text>
  <text start="691.61" dur="5.89">manipulated to make it look like the</text>
  <text start="694.23" dur="6.35">economy is doing much better than it is</text>
  <text start="697.5" dur="6.75">and the unemployment rate is much higher</text>
  <text start="700.58" dur="6.31">but we all knew that we all you know</text>
  <text start="704.25" dur="4.89">understand that everything was changed</text>
  <text start="706.89" dur="4.8">and manipulated to make things look</text>
  <text start="709.14" dur="4.38">better and this all went into the Fed</text>
  <text start="711.69" dur="3.959">saying if the unemployment comes down</text>
  <text start="713.52" dur="8.28">you know we&amp;#39;re going to you know stop</text>
  <text start="715.649" dur="9.241">the QE we&amp;#39;re going to you know taper the</text>
  <text start="721.8" dur="5.64">QE and this was to make everyone believe</text>
  <text start="724.89" dur="4.199">that things were getting better so</text>
  <text start="727.44" dur="3.42">people would go out and buy housing</text>
  <text start="729.089" dur="3.631">people would go and put their money in</text>
  <text start="730.86" dur="4.229">the stock market people would start</text>
  <text start="732.72" dur="5.88">spending but none of that is really</text>
  <text start="735.089" dur="6.721">happening now stock prices are out</text>
  <text start="738.6" dur="6.39">running corporate profits and when did</text>
  <text start="741.81" dur="6.36">this happen before and this happened</text>
  <text start="744.99" dur="8.089">back in the Great Depression and I did a</text>
  <text start="748.17" dur="8.359">couple episodes episode 6 through 8 or 9</text>
  <text start="753.079" dur="8.731">comparing today to the Great Depression</text>

  <text start="761.81" dur="5.44">compared to what is going on during the</text>
  <text start="765.779" dur="3.81">Great Depression and what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="767.25" dur="5.19">right now consumer prices were deflated</text>
  <text start="769.589" dur="6.24">about one and a half percent per year</text>
  <text start="772.44" dur="4.44">house prices were stagnating the</text>

  <text start="776.88" dur="5.31">above its low in the previous business</text>
  <text start="779.04" dur="5.85">cycle the European monetary system was</text>
  <text start="782.19" dur="4.62">at risk of coming apart at the seams due</text>
  <text start="784.89" dur="4.65">to England struggling to maintain its</text>
  <text start="786.81" dur="5.519">link to gold at an overvalued exchange</text>

  <text start="792.329" dur="6.391">and England with periphery and you have</text>
  <text start="795.329" dur="5.25">today&amp;#39;s conditions in Europe Germany was</text>

  <text start="815.29" dur="6.139">that aren&amp;#39;t unlike those of the 1920s</text>
  <text start="818.79" dur="4.93">but what about the stock market</text>
  <text start="821.429" dur="4.84">unfortunately a few market</text>
  <text start="823.72" dur="5.82">characteristic Eric teristics hit the</text>

  <text start="846.04" dur="4.739">markets performance in the 1927 and</text>
  <text start="848.589" dur="4.5">early nineteen twenty eight and we can</text>
  <text start="850.779" dur="5.4">see this happening again I said in the</text>
  <text start="853.089" dur="7.5">Great Depression just like now Europe</text>
  <text start="856.179" dur="6.6">was in a deep recession / depression the</text>
  <text start="860.589" dur="3.87">stock market was at its all-time highs</text>
  <text start="862.779" dur="3.99">and back then the all-time highs were</text>
  <text start="864.459" dur="5.25">around 400 points or so today they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="866.769" dur="8.22">approaching 16,000 points but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="869.709" dur="7.92">seeing the same exact thing again the</text>
  <text start="874.989" dur="5.97">central bankers have learned how to</text>
  <text start="877.629" dur="6.12">cover up so people don&amp;#39;t notice certain</text>
  <text start="880.959" dur="6.63">things like in the Great Depression we</text>
  <text start="883.749" dur="6.42">had before the collapse we had high</text>
  <text start="887.589" dur="5.85">unemployment people looking for works 10</text>
  <text start="890.169" dur="7.561">cities starting to appear soup line</text>
  <text start="893.439" dur="6.75">bread lines starting to form and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="897.73" dur="4.799">happening today is you don&amp;#39;t see any of</text>
  <text start="900.189" dur="5.88">that because they&amp;#39;ve realized if we can</text>
  <text start="902.529" dur="5.071">cover this up no one will know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="906.069" dur="6.721">going on and how do they cover it up</text>
  <text start="907.6" dur="8.479">with food stamps with welfare with</text>
  <text start="912.79" dur="9.269">assistance with unemployment all of this</text>
  <text start="916.079" dur="9.19">allows the people to scrape by without</text>
  <text start="922.059" dur="6.06">seeing the lines so when you talk to</text>
  <text start="925.269" dur="5.04">people who are just going about their</text>
  <text start="928.119" dur="6.861">daily lives and not you know not knowing</text>
  <text start="930.309" dur="7.28">about anything they realize that</text>
  <text start="934.98" dur="6.21">that they see that the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="937.589" dur="11.011">very very well but in reality it is not</text>
  <text start="941.19" dur="10.62">because everyone around 50 million</text>
  <text start="948.6" dur="7.56">people or so are on food stamps but you</text>
  <text start="951.81" dur="8.73">don&amp;#39;t see them and this is the big big</text>
  <text start="956.16" dur="8.039">difference okay let&amp;#39;s move on now now</text>
  <text start="960.54" dur="8.01">Iran barters 9 million of electricity</text>
  <text start="964.199" dur="8.911">for wheat from Pakistan now this is a</text>
  <text start="968.55" dur="7.649">great example of bartering now the u.s.</text>
  <text start="973.11" dur="6.39">put sanctions on Iran and then making it</text>
  <text start="976.199" dur="5.971">impossible for them to do trade with</text>
  <text start="979.5" dur="6.42">other countries so what they decided to</text>
  <text start="982.17" dur="9.599">do with an agreement with Pakistan was</text>
  <text start="985.92" dur="7.89">to to import wheat valued at nine</text>
  <text start="991.769" dur="6.211">million from its eastern neighbor in</text>
  <text start="993.81" dur="7.829">exchange for electricity so this is a</text>
  <text start="997.98" dur="7.65">brilliant idea and we can see when the</text>
  <text start="1001.639" dur="7.351">collapse comes around the world you need</text>
  <text start="1005.63" dur="6.72">things to border with because in this</text>
  <text start="1008.99" dur="5.219">case they can&amp;#39;t use money because of all</text>
  <text start="1012.35" dur="4.859">the sanctions and everything that&amp;#39;s put</text>
  <text start="1014.209" dur="4.771">in place so they were at one time they</text>
  <text start="1017.209" dur="3.601">were trying to they weren&amp;#39;t they what</text>
  <text start="1018.98" dur="3.06">they were selling their oil and</text>
  <text start="1020.81" dur="3.629">everything for gold and then the</text>
  <text start="1022.04" dur="7.129">additional sanctions were put on Iran</text>
  <text start="1024.439" dur="4.73">and now they&amp;#39;re left to bartering and</text>
  <text start="1029.5" dur="6.069">this is a like I said a great example</text>
  <text start="1032.75" dur="6.299">where when the economic collapse hits</text>
  <text start="1035.569" dur="6.721">and money is not that important at a</text>
  <text start="1039.049" dur="6">certain period of time and you have rice</text>
  <text start="1042.29" dur="5.399">and someone has medical supplies that</text>
  <text start="1045.049" dur="5.25">could be an even exchange and this is</text>
  <text start="1047.689" dur="8.071">why it&amp;#39;s good to prep it&amp;#39;s another good</text>
  <text start="1050.299" dur="9.961">reason to prep okay now China is sending</text>
  <text start="1055.76" dur="7.62">troops to Africa now US has sent troops</text>
  <text start="1060.26" dur="6.6">to add to malli in Africa the French</text>
  <text start="1063.38" dur="4.95">have sent troops to Mali in Africa now</text>
  <text start="1066.86" dur="5.28">why does everyone</text>
  <text start="1068.33" dur="6.9">why is everyone want to go into malli</text>
  <text start="1072.14" dur="4.74">you know I hear al-qaeda we&amp;#39;re fighting</text>
  <text start="1075.23" dur="4.74">you know that there&amp;#39;s new and soot and</text>
  <text start="1076.88" dur="6.96">insurgents happening people are the</text>
  <text start="1079.97" dur="6.839">human a humanitarian reason all this</text>
  <text start="1083.84" dur="5.49">other crap that they throw out there but</text>
  <text start="1086.809" dur="4.681">the real reason why all of these</text>
  <text start="1089.33" dur="5.25">countries and central bankers are trying</text>
  <text start="1091.49" dur="8.13">to get in and even China is because</text>
  <text start="1094.58" dur="8.849">malli is the world&amp;#39;s third largest gold</text>
  <text start="1099.62" dur="6.47">producer again I&amp;#39;ve said this before the</text>
  <text start="1103.429" dur="6.271">central bankers and China knows this</text>
  <text start="1106.09" dur="6.67">they want hard assets and wherever they</text>
  <text start="1109.7" dur="5.459">are you will find a central banker you</text>
  <text start="1112.76" dur="6.149">will find the US government you will</text>
  <text start="1115.159" dur="7.74">find you know any Western centrally</text>
  <text start="1118.909" dur="7.89">central bank controlled country you will</text>
  <text start="1122.899" dur="6.331">find them fighting a war that really</text>
  <text start="1126.799" dur="5.461">doesn&amp;#39;t exist to get the natural</text>
  <text start="1129.23" dur="5.76">resources and to control the country</text>
  <text start="1132.26" dur="7.68">that&amp;#39;s all there is that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1134.99" dur="8.1">about and we see this happening more and</text>
  <text start="1139.94" dur="5.579">more Japan to deploy ships after China</text>
  <text start="1143.09" dur="7.67">detected drilling in disputed waters now</text>
  <text start="1145.519" dur="7.89">China is drilling for oil near the</text>
  <text start="1150.76" dur="3.82">Senate cuckoo islands in the eastern</text>
  <text start="1153.409" dur="4.801">China and this is the island that</text>
  <text start="1154.58" dur="6.99">they&amp;#39;re fighting over and again here we</text>
  <text start="1158.21" dur="5.52">are now the real reason comes out of why</text>
  <text start="1161.57" dur="6.69">there they want to be in this region</text>
  <text start="1163.73" dur="9.51">because there are natural resources here</text>
  <text start="1168.26" dur="9">there are hard assets and like I said</text>
  <text start="1173.24" dur="7.819">before wherever you see these Western</text>
  <text start="1177.26" dur="9.06">Bank wet western-backed central banks</text>
  <text start="1181.059" dur="7.86">you will see the central bankers going</text>
  <text start="1186.32" dur="6.66">for these hard assets and here we are</text>
  <text start="1188.919" dur="8.11">off the coast of Japan and China in this</text>
  <text start="1192.98" dur="6.72">island of fighting over hard assets</text>
  <text start="1197.029" dur="4.891">again and this is what it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="1199.7" dur="6.6">and again this is also</text>
  <text start="1201.92" dur="7.83">fueling the war that will eventually</text>
  <text start="1206.3" dur="6.69">cover up the economic collapse because</text>
  <text start="1209.75" dur="5.49">at this point in time the central</text>
  <text start="1212.99" dur="7.2">bankers and other governments like China</text>
  <text start="1215.24" dur="8.4">and Russia or all rushing to make claims</text>
  <text start="1220.19" dur="5.97">to wear all these natural resources are</text>
  <text start="1223.64" dur="6.78">because they know what&amp;#39;s coming they</text>
  <text start="1226.16" dur="6.69">know what&amp;#39;s going to happen now I</text>
