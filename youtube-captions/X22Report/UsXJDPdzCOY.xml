  <text start="78.03" dur="3.839">and a portrait on the front any Trump</text>
  <text start="80.1" dur="4.53">supporter would be crazy about one of</text>
  <text start="81.869" dur="5.64">these go to Trump coin 2020 calm and use</text>
  <text start="84.63" dur="5.43">the code X 22 to get free shipping this</text>
  <text start="87.509" dur="4.53">is a six dollar and fifty cents savings</text>
  <text start="90.06" dur="4.8">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="92.039" dur="4.351">financial news now we know that part of</text>
  <text start="94.86" dur="5.22">the plan is to get rid of the central</text>
  <text start="96.39" dur="5.069">bank and we know that Trump has Andrew</text>
  <text start="100.08" dur="3.899">Jackson hanging on the wall</text>
  <text start="101.459" dur="3.031">I do believe Powell is working with</text>
  <text start="103.979" dur="2.941">Trump</text>
  <text start="104.49" dur="4.799">I do believe they&amp;#39;re working together</text>
  <text start="106.92" dur="4.259">and does this mean that Powell is going</text>
  <text start="109.289" dur="3.631">to stay in this position forever no</text>
  <text start="111.179" dur="3.78">because we can see from the past if</text>
  <text start="112.92" dur="4.38">Trump doesn&amp;#39;t need the individual</text>
  <text start="114.959" dur="3.931">anymore he removes them remember these</text>
  <text start="117.3" dur="3.84">individuals are in a certain position</text>
  <text start="118.89" dur="6.42">for a certain period of time to do a</text>
  <text start="121.14" dur="6.42">specific task that is it and then once</text>
  <text start="125.31" dur="4.89">that task is finished or Trump doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="127.56" dur="5.46">like how they&amp;#39;re doing their job he</text>
  <text start="130.2" dur="7.97">removes them at this point we can see</text>
  <text start="133.02" dur="9.36">that Powell is being controlled by Trump</text>
  <text start="138.17" dur="6.13">q has told us that the feds mission and</text>
  <text start="142.38" dur="6.84">this was way before Powell came into</text>
  <text start="144.3" dur="6.87">office was to bring down the economy by</text>
  <text start="149.22" dur="4.05">raising the interest rates now we know</text>
  <text start="151.17" dur="5.27">this is one of the feds tactic we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="153.27" dur="7.23">seen in the past if you go back to 2006</text>
  <text start="156.44" dur="6.01">2007 you can see the Fed raised the</text>
  <text start="160.5" dur="4.53">rates to a certain point until the</text>
  <text start="162.45" dur="3.3">economy started to fall apart then they</text>
  <text start="165.03" dur="3.12">dropped it</text>
  <text start="165.75" dur="4.94">like there was no tomorrow so no one</text>
  <text start="168.15" dur="5.16">would really notice what they did and</text>
  <text start="170.69" dur="6.04">they pretend that they had nothing to do</text>
  <text start="173.31" dur="5.28">with this well Trump the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="176.73" dur="5.49">knew exactly what the Fed was trying to</text>
  <text start="178.59" dur="7.26">do and Trump was out there contradicting</text>
  <text start="182.22" dur="5.88">the Fed at every turn now this did two</text>
  <text start="185.85" dur="5.25">things first it brought attention to the</text>
  <text start="188.1" dur="5.85">Fed that when they do something it could</text>
  <text start="191.1" dur="4.83">hurt the economy many people thought oh</text>
  <text start="193.95" dur="3.42">the feds in the background they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="195.93" dur="4.62">want to hurt the economy they have no</text>
  <text start="197.37" dur="6.06">responsibility in the economy all they</text>
  <text start="200.55" dur="4.32">do is manage things and it&amp;#39;s everyone</text>
  <text start="203.43" dur="4.86">else that&amp;#39;s the problem</text>
  <text start="204.87" dur="6.63">Trump brought them to the front of the</text>
  <text start="208.29" dur="5.58">line letting everyone know look every</text>
  <text start="211.5" dur="4.92">time the Fed does this the market comes</text>
  <text start="213.87" dur="5.88">down every time the Fed does this we</text>
  <text start="216.42" dur="6.81">have problems now it looked like Trump</text>
  <text start="219.75" dur="8.22">instructed Powell to hold off on the</text>
  <text start="223.23" dur="7.759">interest rate hikes why because he knows</text>
  <text start="227.97" dur="5.64">he cannot have the economy come down</text>
  <text start="230.989" dur="5.951">during the 2020 elections does this mean</text>
  <text start="233.61" dur="6.12">the economy&amp;#39;s doing fantastic no this</text>
  <text start="236.94" dur="6.57">means the statistical numbers will look</text>
  <text start="239.73" dur="8.64">really good and it will slow the decline</text>
  <text start="243.51" dur="7.38">of everything else that&amp;#39;s it but Powell</text>
  <text start="248.37" dur="6">did say something very interesting today</text>
  <text start="250.89" dur="6.42">which we&amp;#39;re going to get into now we see</text>
  <text start="254.37" dur="5.31">the initial jobless claims they exploded</text>
  <text start="257.31" dur="4.739">higher by 53,000 last week to two</text>
  <text start="259.68" dur="4.53">hundred and fifty three thousand now we</text>
  <text start="262.049" dur="5.281">all know why this happened this was</text>
  <text start="264.21" dur="5.91">because of the shutdown all the</text>
  <text start="267.33" dur="5.7">government employees filed now most</text>
  <text start="270.12" dur="5.22">likely this will reverse itself once the</text>
  <text start="273.03" dur="3.96">government is open full time and this</text>
  <text start="275.34" dur="3.54">will completely disappear but we know</text>
  <text start="276.99" dur="3.33">that the initial jobless claims we know</text>
  <text start="278.88" dur="5.58">that the unemployment numbers we know</text>
  <text start="280.32" dur="6.599">that all these are fake numbers and we</text>
  <text start="284.46" dur="4.25">can see at this point we&amp;#39;ve seen how</text>
  <text start="286.919" dur="4.141">they&amp;#39;ve done this we know how they</text>
  <text start="288.71" dur="4.6">manipulate the calculations we went over</text>
  <text start="291.06" dur="4.169">this many many times before now we</text>
  <text start="293.31" dur="5.02">understand that the housing market is</text>
  <text start="295.229" dur="5.65">not doing well now since the Fed</text>
  <text start="298.33" dur="6.329">has decided not to raise the rates once</text>
  <text start="300.879" dur="6.211">again this will slow the decline of the</text>
  <text start="304.659" dur="5.431">housing market is it still going to</text>
  <text start="307.09" dur="5.25">decline absolutely I mean yesterday we</text>
  <text start="310.09" dur="4.289">talked about pending home sales I mean</text>
  <text start="312.34" dur="3.299">this is a little glimpse into the future</text>
  <text start="314.379" dur="4.29">this is how many contracts are signed</text>
  <text start="315.639" dur="5.4">and we can already see there are fewer</text>
  <text start="318.669" dur="5.46">and fewer contracts being signed which</text>
  <text start="321.039" dur="5.761">tells us that in the future existing</text>
  <text start="324.129" dur="5.79">homes new homes they&amp;#39;re going to decline</text>
  <text start="326.8" dur="6.23">also it might be at a slower pace but</text>
  <text start="329.919" dur="6.271">we&amp;#39;re going to see the declines continue</text>
  <text start="333.03" dur="6.34">remember this economy is built on an</text>
  <text start="336.19" dur="7.62">illusion it&amp;#39;s built on what the Fed has</text>
  <text start="339.37" dur="7.759">done in the past if the Fed just removed</text>
  <text start="343.81" dur="7.109">itself from this entire picture and</text>
  <text start="347.129" dur="6.671">didn&amp;#39;t control the market didn&amp;#39;t control</text>
  <text start="350.919" dur="5.43">the interest rate let the entire economy</text>
  <text start="353.8" dur="5.85">be a free economy the whole thing would</text>
  <text start="356.349" dur="6.331">implode on itself and the reason why it</text>
  <text start="359.65" dur="6.569">would implode himself is because the Fed</text>
  <text start="362.68" dur="7.109">knows the economy cannot sustain itself</text>
  <text start="366.219" dur="7.26">in the way it is today they have to</text>
  <text start="369.789" dur="5.81">control every aspect which means they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="373.479" dur="4.771">controlling what the stock market does</text>
  <text start="375.599" dur="5.921">along with Trump and his magic wand</text>
  <text start="378.25" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;re controlling the interest rates</text>
  <text start="381.52" dur="5.369">they&amp;#39;re controlling precious metals</text>
  <text start="384.31" dur="6.659">they&amp;#39;re controlling everything that we</text>
  <text start="386.889" dur="6.21">see today and once this is stopped</text>
  <text start="390.969" dur="6.69">that&amp;#39;s when the economy has a problem</text>
  <text start="393.099" dur="6.961">why do you think the economy has been</text>
  <text start="397.659" dur="4.94">declining think about it the Fed has</text>
  <text start="400.06" dur="5.25">been unwinding its balance sheet</text>
  <text start="402.599" dur="6.461">allowing the interest rates to move up</text>
  <text start="405.31" dur="6.63">because they are doing it once this</text>
  <text start="409.06" dur="7.02">happens the economy started to rapidly</text>
  <text start="411.94" dur="7.409">fall apart because they suppress the</text>
  <text start="416.08" dur="7.079">interest rates they took on all the</text>
  <text start="419.349" dur="6.241">toxic waste the housing loans and bought</text>
  <text start="423.159" dur="5.19">up a lot of Treasuries if you notice</text>
  <text start="425.59" dur="6.26">once they start to release it and let</text>
  <text start="428.349" dur="6.411">the system kind of not really</text>
  <text start="431.85" dur="5.34">do what it&amp;#39;s supposed to be doing it all</text>
  <text start="434.76" dur="4.71">falls apart so without there there&amp;#39;s air</text>
  <text start="437.19" dur="4.53">suppression without them manipulating</text>
  <text start="439.47" dur="4.56">without them doing all these things the</text>
  <text start="441.72" dur="3.96">economy completely falls apart now Trump</text>
  <text start="444.03" dur="5.19">knows this he knows exactly how this</text>
  <text start="445.68" dur="5.25">works and this is why Q has been saying</text>
  <text start="449.22" dur="3.15">that eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="450.93" dur="4.22">his gold is going to bring down this</text>
  <text start="452.37" dur="7.47">entire economy but it just can&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="455.15" dur="6.97">yet because Trump has been unwinding the</text>
  <text start="459.84" dur="5.07">globalists system the central bank</text>
  <text start="462.12" dur="6.09">system and he has to do it one step at a</text>
  <text start="464.91" dur="5.94">time he has to put everything in the</text>
  <text start="468.21" dur="5.52">right order make the deals he needs to</text>
  <text start="470.85" dur="5.46">make remove the globalist trade policies</text>
  <text start="473.73" dur="5.22">and make sure the economy can be</text>
  <text start="476.31" dur="4.8">sustained when we come off the central</text>
  <text start="478.95" dur="4.23">bank system because if everything is not</text>
  <text start="481.11" dur="6.39">in place guess what happens to the</text>
  <text start="483.18" dur="6.09">economy it implodes on itself now us in</text>
  <text start="487.5" dur="4.11">China they are going to begin the</text>
  <text start="489.27" dur="3.78">high-level trade talks in DC there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="491.61" dur="3.51">going to be two days of intense trade</text>
  <text start="493.05" dur="4.89">discussions that will begin in the</text>
  <text start="495.12" dur="4.8">Eisenhower building led by US Trade</text>
  <text start="497.94" dur="4.47">Representative Robert light Heiser and</text>
  <text start="499.92" dur="5.1">his Chinese counterpart vice premier Liu</text>
  <text start="502.41" dur="4.71">hee and they&amp;#39;re gonna be talking about</text>
  <text start="505.02" dur="4.77">trade now Trump did come out and he</text>
  <text start="507.12" dur="4.65">tweeted the following China&amp;#39;s top trade</text>
  <text start="509.79" dur="4.02">negotiators are in the u.s. meeting with</text>
  <text start="511.77" dur="4.05">our representatives meetings are going</text>
  <text start="513.81" dur="4.169">well with good intent and spurred on</text>
  <text start="515.82" dur="4.23">both sides China does not want an</text>
  <text start="517.979" dur="4.141">increase in tariffs and feels they will</text>
  <text start="520.05" dur="3.96">do much better if they make a deal they</text>
  <text start="522.12" dur="3.66">are correct I&amp;#39;ll be meeting with their</text>
  <text start="524.01" dur="3.93">top leaders and representatives today in</text>
  <text start="525.78" dur="4.98">the Oval Office no final deal will be</text>
  <text start="527.94" dur="4.98">made until my friend President Xi and I</text>
  <text start="530.76" dur="4.65">meet in the near future to discuss and</text>
  <text start="532.92" dur="4.92">agree on some of the long-standing and</text>
  <text start="535.41" dur="4.92">more difficult points very comprehensive</text>

  <text start="567.65" dur="6.66">deals where both sides benefit</text>
  <text start="571.46" dur="5.58">remember the deep state the globalist</text>
  <text start="574.31" dur="5.16">had it weighted towards China there was</text>
  <text start="577.04" dur="4.98">a very good reason for that because we</text>
  <text start="579.47" dur="6.8">were gonna move everything to China at</text>
  <text start="582.02" dur="6.96">that time now everything has changed now</text>
  <text start="586.27" dur="5.35">Trump is bringing everything back to the</text>
  <text start="588.98" dur="6.96">United States and he wants to level the</text>
  <text start="591.62" dur="5.85">playing field now we know that Trump he</text>
  <text start="595.94" dur="4.32">does not like the Federal Reserve he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="597.47" dur="8.07">tweeted in the past saying that the Fed</text>

  <text start="617.3" dur="6.09">how fast the debt was increasing they</text>
  <text start="622.16" dur="3.78">always said that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="623.39" dur="5.63">usually the central banks they don&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="625.94" dur="6.81">that much about the debt until</text>
  <text start="629.02" dur="7.69">everything goes south then they tell the</text>

  <text start="801.45" dur="6.6">and he&amp;#39;s going to continue to do this</text>
  <text start="804" dur="5.13">and after the elections most likely he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="808.05" dur="4.68">going to continue with the</text>
  <text start="809.13" dur="6.89">contradictions pointing out that the Fed</text>
  <text start="812.73" dur="6.299">is the problem preparing the Fed for</text>
  <text start="816.02" dur="6.429">restructuring and then eventually maybe</text>

  <text start="828.009" dur="6.12">complicated this time because the</text>
  <text start="830.199" dur="9.95">Federal Reserve the IMF the biz the deep</text>
  <text start="834.129" dur="9.96">state they set up this gigantic massive</text>
  <text start="840.149" dur="7.42">web that goes across the world where</text>
  <text start="844.089" dur="6.81">everything is interconnected and you</text>
  <text start="847.569" dur="4.651">just can&amp;#39;t pull the plug or many people</text>
  <text start="850.899" dur="4.021">and I&amp;#39;m talking about the everyday</text>
  <text start="852.22" dur="4.919">person they would suffer the</text>
  <text start="854.92" dur="5.24">consequences know the wealthy that&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="857.139" dur="6.421">fine the Rothschilds they will be fine</text>
  <text start="860.16" dur="6.849">Trump has to end and the Patriots need</text>
  <text start="863.56" dur="6.779">to methodically plan this out which they</text>
  <text start="867.009" dur="8.94">have done and they need to take one step</text>
  <text start="870.339" dur="9.6">at a time to bring the central bank&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="875.949" dur="7.771">their knees at the same time they need</text>
  <text start="879.939" dur="7.77">to do this while they don&amp;#39;t hurt the</text>
  <text start="883.72" dur="6.419">everyday person now this is a great task</text>
  <text start="887.709" dur="4.021">this is not this is not something that</text>
  <text start="890.139" dur="2.911">you just can do and you just pull the</text>
  <text start="891.73" dur="3.57">plug out of the wall and say it we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="893.05" dur="4.469">done everyone&amp;#39;s on their own good luck</text>
  <text start="895.3" dur="4.649">because there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot of</text>
  <text start="897.519" dur="4.44">people that are going to get hurt and</text>
  <text start="899.949" dur="4.14">what I mean by getting hurt</text>
  <text start="901.959" dur="5.25">well people losing their life savings</text>
  <text start="904.089" dur="6.451">people can&amp;#39;t feed themselves people get</text>
  <text start="907.209" dur="7.141">angry and they start to riot people are</text>
  <text start="910.54" dur="6.39">so pissed off they topple governments</text>
  <text start="914.35" dur="4.02">around the world there&amp;#39;s anarchy all</text>
  <text start="916.93" dur="4.259">over the place</text>
  <text start="918.37" dur="6.6">and it turns into a Mad Max type of</text>
  <text start="921.189" dur="6.031">scenario we can&amp;#39;t have that situation</text>
  <text start="924.97" dur="5.13">that is going to help absolutely nobody</text>
  <text start="927.22" dur="5">actually the elites would love that</text>
  <text start="930.1" dur="5.039">because it would reduce the population</text>
  <text start="932.22" dur="4.929">Trump and the Patriots what they would</text>
  <text start="935.139" dur="5.07">like to do he was that they would like</text>
  <text start="937.149" dur="5.701">to bring the system down in a way where</text>
  <text start="940.209" dur="4.44">they have a backstop where everything is</text>
  <text start="942.85" dur="4.83">in place the trade deals are in place</text>
  <text start="944.649" dur="5.761">the gold is waiting they have a way to</text>
  <text start="947.68" dur="5.009">transition everything from the central</text>
  <text start="950.41" dur="4.619">bank into the new economic system where</text>
  <text start="952.689" dur="5.431">a minimum a minimal amount of people are</text>
  <text start="955.029" dur="4.351">hurt and this is the approach they are</text>
  <text start="958.12" dur="3.27">taking but</text>
