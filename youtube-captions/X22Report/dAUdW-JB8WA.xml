  <text start="90.44" dur="4.89">this point that the u.s. is completely</text>
  <text start="92.6" dur="6.48">responsible for destroying this hospital</text>
  <text start="95.33" dur="5.85">and doctors with borders are pushing the</text>
  <text start="99.08" dur="6.15">idea that the US should be brought up on</text>
  <text start="101.18" dur="5.97">charges for war crimes and we know the</text>
  <text start="105.23" dur="3.6">hospital had a banner on top of the roof</text>

  <text start="116.84" dur="6">buildings around the hospital the</text>
  <text start="119.09" dur="6.3">building is located in a field and the</text>
  <text start="122.84" dur="4.38">US doesn&amp;#39;t want an investigation instead</text>
  <text start="125.39" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re paying off people and we know</text>
  <text start="127.22" dur="6.299">from corporations like insurance</text>
  <text start="129.41" dur="5.939">companies and other types of companies</text>
  <text start="133.519" dur="4.021">like pharmaceuticals when they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="135.349" dur="5.191">want the word out or an investigation</text>
  <text start="137.54" dur="5.07">done they kind of payoff people and this</text>
  <text start="140.54" dur="6.809">is what the US is doing right now now</text>
  <text start="142.61" dur="6.9">normally what companies or governments</text>
  <text start="147.349" dur="3.75">like to do is they like to destroy the</text>
  <text start="149.51" dur="3.24">evidence so there&amp;#39;s nothing left or mess</text>
  <text start="151.099" dur="4.831">it up set so that nobody can make</text>
  <text start="152.75" dur="6.36">anything out of it so the US decided</text>
  <text start="155.93" dur="7.95">they&amp;#39;re going to have a tank force its</text>
  <text start="159.11" dur="5.08">way into the Afghanistan hospital that</text>
  <text start="163.88" dur="4.21">they</text>
  <text start="164.19" dur="6.21">droid what 11 days ago and basically</text>
  <text start="168.09" dur="6.5">what thing we&amp;#39;re doing is driving the</text>
  <text start="170.4" dur="7.59">tank through destroying the evidence I</text>
  <text start="174.59" dur="6.63">mean how much more obvious are they</text>
  <text start="177.99" dur="6.36">going to make it that they knew and they</text>
  <text start="181.22" dur="5.82">wanted to hit this hospital even though</text>
  <text start="184.35" dur="4.8">there were no combatants in there and</text>
  <text start="187.04" dur="6.49">now they&amp;#39;re in there with a tank</text>
  <text start="189.15" dur="9.51">destroying the evidence it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="193.53" dur="6.72">mind-boggling now out in turkey turkey</text>
  <text start="198.66" dur="4.47">is running around saying we shot down a</text>
  <text start="200.25" dur="4.8">drone it&amp;#39;s of unknown origin Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="203.13" dur="4.74">saying well all drones that we have are</text>
  <text start="205.05" dur="4.77">functioning normally all of them return</text>
  <text start="207.87" dur="6.06">to base so we don&amp;#39;t know whose drone</text>
  <text start="209.82" dur="6">this is at this time now it could be</text>
  <text start="213.93" dur="3.15">Russia&amp;#39;s drawn maybe they&amp;#39;re just saying</text>
  <text start="215.82" dur="3.03">you know something we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="217.08" dur="4.77">let the information out that we had a</text>
  <text start="218.85" dur="5.19">drone go down or turkeys making a big</text>
  <text start="221.85" dur="4.41">deal about this and it could be maybe a</text>
  <text start="224.04" dur="3.62">US drone and this is why they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="226.26" dur="4.199">saying but we don&amp;#39;t know at this point</text>
  <text start="227.66" dur="8.799">all we know is that turkey knocked down</text>
  <text start="230.459" dur="9.951">a drone now the US and Russia are</text>
  <text start="236.459" dur="7.021">talking about air safety in Syria and</text>
  <text start="240.41" dur="6.82">they&amp;#39;re only talking about the technical</text>
  <text start="243.48" dur="6.39">questions rush is saying that they will</text>
  <text start="247.23" dur="6.96">soon sign an agreement on flight safety</text>
  <text start="249.87" dur="6.54">over Syria and Obama is out there saying</text>
  <text start="254.19" dur="3.419">we can&amp;#39;t agree on anything everything</text>
  <text start="256.41" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re talking about we really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="257.609" dur="3.121">agree on there&amp;#39;s a couple issues that we</text>
  <text start="259.5" dur="3.96">do agree on but most of it we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="260.73" dur="4.14">agree on well I think they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="263.46" dur="4.38">about too thick two different things</text>
  <text start="264.87" dur="5.04">here Obama is most likely talking about</text>
  <text start="267.84" dur="4.38">how rush is not agreeing to leave the</text>
  <text start="269.91" dur="5.64">area and you know stop the bombing of</text>
  <text start="272.22" dur="6.3">the Islamic state and all they wanted to</text>
  <text start="275.55" dur="4.56">talk about is air safety and Obama</text>
  <text start="278.52" dur="6.03">saying they&amp;#39;re not agreeing with what</text>
  <text start="280.11" dur="8.16">we&amp;#39;re what we&amp;#39;re proposing which is stop</text>
  <text start="284.55" dur="6.63">bombing the Islamic state and we see</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="4.709">right now that Russia is continually</text>
  <text start="291.18" dur="5.92">bombing not just the Islamic state other</text>
  <text start="292.979" dur="8.141">terrorist groups inside the country</text>
  <text start="297.1" dur="8">and at this time in the Middle East in</text>
  <text start="301.12" dur="6.69">the Mediterranean we see that all</text>
  <text start="305.1" dur="7.27">aircraft carriers the United States</text>
  <text start="307.81" dur="6.18">aircraft carriers have been recalled now</text>
  <text start="312.37" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re saying that they bringing them</text>
  <text start="313.99" dur="5.67">back for maintenance and this is the</text>
  <text start="316.54" dur="7.82">first time for many many years there are</text>
  <text start="319.66" dur="9.42">no aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf</text>
  <text start="324.36" dur="8.74">they have the Essex amphibious worship</text>
  <text start="329.08" dur="8.01">there but they have no aircraft carriers</text>
  <text start="333.1" dur="6.41">but we know going forward aircraft</text>
  <text start="337.09" dur="6.06">carriers are very susceptible today</text>
  <text start="339.51" dur="6.91">because China and Russia have these new</text>
  <text start="343.15" dur="5.58">missiles that can destroy aircraft</text>
  <text start="346.42" dur="4.32">carriers they&amp;#39;re very hard to hit</text>
  <text start="348.73" dur="5.43">because they can maneuver as they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="350.74" dur="7.11">flying towards the target they Bob they</text>
  <text start="354.16" dur="6.15">weave and at this point Russia has</text>
  <text start="357.85" dur="6.18">proven they can take their missiles from</text>
  <text start="360.31" dur="9.9">a very far distance and hit each one of</text>
  <text start="364.03" dur="7.89">the targets and like I said before when</text>
  <text start="370.21" dur="5.4">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="371.92" dur="7.14">bankers brings us into this war we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="375.61" dur="8.64">not fighting Yemen Libya an African</text>
  <text start="379.06" dur="9.45">country ukraine we&amp;#39;re fighting countries</text>
  <text start="384.25" dur="7.47">that have weapons equal to or greater</text>
  <text start="388.51" dur="7.17">than the United States plus they have</text>
  <text start="391.72" dur="5.61">nuclear weapons and we can see the</text>
  <text start="395.68" dur="3.63">United States forces that are spread all</text>
  <text start="397.33" dur="3.42">around the globe they&amp;#39;re exhausted</text>
  <text start="399.31" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re tired the equipment they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="400.75" dur="8.52">using not so great i mean the f-35 is a</text>
  <text start="404.62" dur="8.96">lemon it&amp;#39;s not really working it can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="409.27" dur="9.45">even beat a jet which is like 20 years</text>
  <text start="413.58" dur="8.59">older than it in a dogfight so the u.s.</text>
  <text start="418.72" dur="7.44">is no way ready to go to war and of</text>
  <text start="422.17" dur="5.249">course those in power especially the</text>
  <text start="426.16" dur="3.81">central bankers they have no allegiance</text>
  <text start="427.419" dur="3.301">to a country or a group their allegiance</text>
  <text start="429.97" dur="4.62">is to dead</text>
  <text start="430.72" dur="8.49">but the US government they do believe</text>
  <text start="434.59" dur="7.8">that they can win this type of war even</text>
  <text start="439.21" dur="5.82">if it goes nuclear because they&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="442.39" dur="6.24">hide in their bunkers and they&amp;#39;ll emerge</text>
  <text start="445.03" dur="7.61">later saying say we won I mean the</text>
  <text start="448.63" dur="6.51">population is cut in half but we won and</text>
  <text start="452.64" dur="6.64">this should make everyone very very</text>
  <text start="455.14" dur="7.32">nervous now Russia is continually</text>
  <text start="459.28" dur="4.86">pushing the Islamists take back the</text>
  <text start="462.46" dur="3.77">growing numbers of the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="464.14" dur="4.62">militants in Syria have become</text>
  <text start="466.23" dur="5.79">discontent with their command and</text>
  <text start="468.76" dur="7.2">they&amp;#39;re deserting they&amp;#39;re running and</text>
  <text start="472.02" dur="6.88">the u.s. is quickly trying to maneuver</text>
  <text start="475.96" dur="5.25">and have them join this new group so</text>
  <text start="478.9" dur="5.04">they can say ah there is no more Islamic</text>
  <text start="481.21" dur="5.1">state but they still have their forces</text>
  <text start="483.94" dur="3.69">and all they did was rebrand them and</text>
  <text start="486.31" dur="5.46">this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do at</text>
  <text start="487.63" dur="7.41">this point Iran is out there saying that</text>
  <text start="491.77" dur="6.39">all of this propaganda that&amp;#39;s out there</text>
  <text start="495.04" dur="7.5">is just that propaganda we do not have</text>
  <text start="498.16" dur="6.33">troops in Syria Iran has dismissed</text>
  <text start="502.54" dur="4.5">reports claiming that Turan has</text>
  <text start="504.49" dur="4.05">dispatched ground troops to Syria the</text>
  <text start="507.04" dur="3.48">official said the claim by foreign</text>
  <text start="508.54" dur="3.57">officials and media about the presence</text>
  <text start="510.52" dur="3.959">of Iranian troops on the ground in Syria</text>
  <text start="512.11" dur="7.29">is aimed at distorting realities about</text>
  <text start="514.479" dur="7.351">the events well do they have a full-on</text>
  <text start="519.4" dur="5.73">force in Syria no but they do have</text>
  <text start="521.83" dur="5.57">advisers they do have small number of</text>
  <text start="525.13" dur="7.05">troops just like Russia do they have</text>
  <text start="527.4" dur="6.4">150,000 troops now and you can see</text>
  <text start="532.18" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;ve been adding and training and</text>
  <text start="533.8" dur="6.96">helping out but there&amp;#39;s not a problem</text>
  <text start="536.2" dur="8.85">with this because Assad is an ally with</text>
  <text start="540.76" dur="7.56">Iran and Russia and he asked these</text>
  <text start="545.05" dur="7.35">countries for assistance he didn&amp;#39;t ask</text>
  <text start="548.32" dur="9.3">the United States UK Spain France Italy</text>
  <text start="552.4" dur="11.01">Australia Saudi Arabia Egypt Jordan</text>
  <text start="557.62" dur="6.84">guitar to come into his country actually</text>
  <text start="563.41" dur="4.89">all these countries</text>
  <text start="564.46" dur="5.88">invaded Syria a sovereign country now</text>
  <text start="568.3" dur="3.87">the Obama administration is out there</text>
  <text start="570.34" dur="4.92">and they&amp;#39;re saying listen we just had a</text>
  <text start="572.17" dur="4.95">successful weapons drop in Syria it went</text>
  <text start="575.26" dur="5.07">to the people it was supposed to go to</text>
  <text start="577.12" dur="5.43">we have confirmation of this and we are</text>
  <text start="580.33" dur="4.89">ready to drop more weapons into Syria</text>
  <text start="582.55" dur="5.85">because we know exactly where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="585.22" dur="8.1">going yeah to the Islamic state Oh</text>
  <text start="588.4" dur="7.56">actually the rebranded group well why</text>
  <text start="593.32" dur="4.88">would we ever believe them that they</text>
  <text start="595.96" dur="4.62">know exactly where anything is going</text>
  <text start="598.2" dur="5.77">because all of these groups and Siri</text>
  <text start="600.58" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re all the same so yeah in some</text>
  <text start="603.97" dur="4.56">sense they do know exactly where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="605.89" dur="6.27">going to all the groups they control</text>
  <text start="608.53" dur="6.93">they all make they control al-qaeda the</text>
  <text start="612.16" dur="7.17">Islamic state the Free Syrian Army the</text>
  <text start="615.46" dur="5.67">rebranded groups so it&amp;#39;s all one in the</text>
  <text start="619.33" dur="5.16">same there&amp;#39;s no difference here and</text>
  <text start="621.13" dur="8.49">they&amp;#39;re ready to bring in more weapons</text>
  <text start="624.49" dur="8.82">more advanced weapons to help out what</text>
  <text start="629.62" dur="6.6">is going on there now the Pentagon is</text>
  <text start="633.31" dur="4.92">out there saying we absolutely know for</text>
  <text start="636.22" dur="3.96">sure that the weapons that we dropped</text>
  <text start="638.23" dur="3.36">off did not go to the Kurds because</text>
  <text start="640.18" dur="3.96">turkeys making a very big deal about</text>
  <text start="641.59" dur="4.41">this and we know who picked them up we</text>
  <text start="644.14" dur="4.77">know it wasn&amp;#39;t the Kurds they have no</text>
  <text start="646" dur="6.72">clue who has these weapons they could be</text>
  <text start="648.91" dur="5.79">anywhere because any group could come in</text>
  <text start="652.72" dur="5.28">the Kurds can come in and take the</text>
  <text start="654.7" dur="5.94">weapons the Kurds have said yes we have</text>
  <text start="658" dur="4.08">received a lot of these weapons so the</text>
  <text start="660.64" dur="3.27">Pentagon is just out there pushing</text>
  <text start="662.08" dur="5.16">propaganda to make everyone feel good</text>
  <text start="663.91" dur="7.47">that everything is going smoothly out in</text>
  <text start="667.24" dur="9.54">Syria with their weapon drops now the</text>
  <text start="671.38" dur="9.23">Syrian government they have had a Syrian</text>
  <text start="676.78" dur="10.5">army officer in the Free Syrian Army as</text>
  <text start="680.61" dur="9.94">a spy he&amp;#39;s been there since 2012 and now</text>
  <text start="687.28" dur="6.84">he has returned to Damascus they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="690.55" dur="8.13">feeding Assad with Intel which allowed</text>
  <text start="694.12" dur="6.6">Assad to basically fight off</text>
  <text start="698.68" dur="7.95">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="700.72" dur="7.92">bankers and their proxy armies so the</text>
  <text start="706.63" dur="6.68">group the Free Syrian Army Group the</text>
  <text start="708.64" dur="7.86">Islamic state they were infiltrated and</text>
  <text start="713.31" dur="7.06">information was being passed back to</text>
  <text start="716.5" dur="8.149">Assad and this is how Assad has remained</text>
  <text start="720.37" dur="6.96">in power for so long this is how he knew</text>
  <text start="724.649" dur="5.651">where they were going to be when they</text>
  <text start="727.33" dur="5.19">were going to be there and this is why</text>
  <text start="730.3" dur="10.07">this battle really hasn&amp;#39;t gone anywhere</text>
  <text start="732.52" dur="12.439">in years now we see the FBI director</text>
  <text start="740.37" dur="7.36">James Comey he is out there once again</text>
  <text start="744.959" dur="4.421">screaming on the top of his lungs that</text>
  <text start="747.73" dur="4.26">the Islamic state terrorist organization</text>
  <text start="749.38" dur="6.39">recruitment of US citizens is so</text>
  <text start="751.99" dur="7.32">widespread and it&amp;#39;s going on 24 hours a</text>
  <text start="755.77" dur="6.09">day hundreds of people are consuming</text>

  <text start="1022.029" dur="4.68">state Russia China North Korea no I</text>
  <text start="1025.48" dur="5.839">think what they&amp;#39;re going to do to kick</text>
  <text start="1026.709" dur="9.391">this off is the NSA with their</text>
  <text start="1031.319" dur="8.441">operatives they will hit certain areas</text>
  <text start="1036.1" dur="5.01">and bring down the grid now they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1039.76" dur="2.569">going to do the entire country all at</text>
  <text start="1041.11" dur="3.599">once that wouldn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="1042.329" dur="4.51">because this way you know people can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1044.709" dur="4.291">turn on their TV their radios you know</text>
  <text start="1046.839" dur="7.261">no one be able to hear the President and</text>

  <text start="1061.57" dur="7.65">time nationwide on the emergency alert</text>
  <text start="1065.92" dur="5.49">system and they don&amp;#39;t want to bring down</text>
  <text start="1069.22" dur="5.52">the entire country though most likely do</text>
  <text start="1071.41" dur="6.47">pockets and this will most likely be</text>
  <text start="1074.74" dur="6.18">coupled with physical attacks because</text>
  <text start="1077.88" dur="7.03">what they did back in two thousand one</text>
  <text start="1080.92" dur="6.93">with 911 this has to be much much bigger</text>
  <text start="1084.91" dur="5.88">to convince the American people that we</text>
  <text start="1087.85" dur="7.11">need to go to war I mean that was big</text>
  <text start="1090.79" dur="8.36">back then buildings came down but if we</text>
  <text start="1094.96" dur="4.19">see at the same time</text>
  <text start="1099.32" dur="6.69">dirty bombs and we know Israel has been</text>
  <text start="1101.33" dur="8.97">testing dirty bombs in the desert if we</text>
  <text start="1106.01" dur="10.29">see dirty bombs go off in multiple</text>
  <text start="1110.3" dur="10.73">cities and we see power grids go down in</text>
  <text start="1116.3" dur="8.87">other cities they can make the case that</text>
  <text start="1121.03" dur="7.27">we are being attacked now cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="1125.17" dur="5.62">they don&amp;#39;t have to show any proof the</text>
  <text start="1128.3" dur="7.5">power grid went down look we&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="1130.79" dur="9.12">attacked the banking system froze up the</text>
  <text start="1135.8" dur="6.93">stock market is down everything came to</text>
  <text start="1139.91" dur="4.8">a screeching halt we&amp;#39;re going to need to</text>

  <text start="1151.1" dur="7.23">everyone&amp;#39;s accounts and this is what</text>
  <text start="1155.48" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re going to play up and I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1158.33" dur="3.51">be surprised if there&amp;#39;s funds missing</text>
  <text start="1160.19" dur="5.7">from people&amp;#39;s accounts and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1161.84" dur="5.54">transferred to central banks and then</text>
  <text start="1165.89" dur="5.85">eventually what they&amp;#39;re going to say is</text>
  <text start="1167.38" dur="6.22">this is so bad that we need to keep the</text>
  <text start="1171.74" dur="4.83">banks closed we might have to go under</text>
  <text start="1173.6" dur="5.61">capital controls because the economy was</text>

  <text start="1184.34" dur="7.53">economy can basically handle this and</text>
  <text start="1189.58" dur="4.9">this is where we&amp;#39;ll see capital controls</text>
  <text start="1191.87" dur="4.77">this world will see balance this is what</text>
  <text start="1194.48" dur="4.67">we see you cannot take out cash you can</text>

  <text start="1203.6" dur="3.57">total of a hundred dollars a month but</text>
  <text start="1206.27" dur="5.4">everything will have to be done</text>
  <text start="1207.17" dur="6.87">electronically and they&amp;#39;ll make some</text>

  <text start="1231.71" dur="6.059">can&amp;#39;t raise interest rates but</text>
  <text start="1233.149" dur="9.87">they will start creating money currency</text>
  <text start="1237.769" dur="8.85">and this will go into overdrive to try</text>
