  <text start="567.25" dur="5.73">different individuals that will confirm</text>
  <text start="570.55" dur="5.22">her story saying that these individuals</text>
  <text start="572.98" dur="6.27">were there and they&amp;#39;re going to confirm</text>
  <text start="575.77" dur="5.76">the story the problem is that two of</text>
  <text start="579.25" dur="3.9">those male classmates who Romare Ramirez</text>
  <text start="581.53" dur="4.17">alleged were involved in the incidents</text>
  <text start="583.15" dur="4.32">the wife of a third male student she</text>

  <text start="594.43" dur="4.08">this didn&amp;#39;t happen we were the people</text>
  <text start="596.95" dur="4.53">closest to Brett Kavanaugh during the</text>
  <text start="598.51" dur="6.12">first year at Yale he was a roommate to</text>
  <text start="601.48" dur="5.49">some of us and we went and we spent a</text>
  <text start="604.63" dur="4.68">great deal of time with him including in</text>
  <text start="606.97" dur="5.1">the dorm where this incident allegedly</text>
  <text start="609.31" dur="5.67">took place some of us were also friends</text>
  <text start="612.07" dur="5.1">with demi Ramirez during the during and</text>
  <text start="614.98" dur="4.74">after her time at Yale we can say with</text>
  <text start="617.17" dur="5.58">confidence that if the incident deputy</text>
  <text start="619.72" dur="5.28">alleges were ever occurred we would have</text>
  <text start="622.75" dur="4.71">seen or heard about it and we did not</text>
  <text start="625" dur="3.81">further those classmates said that the</text>
  <text start="627.46" dur="3.45">allegations in the story would be</text>
  <text start="628.81" dur="4.68">completely out of character for</text>
  <text start="630.91" dur="4.67">Cavanaugh the behavior she describes</text>
  <text start="633.49" dur="5.099">would be completely out of character a</text>
  <text start="635.58" dur="5.14">former student who was best friends with</text>
  <text start="638.589" dur="4.671">Ramirez said she never told her about</text>
  <text start="640.72" dur="5.61">the incident despite how close they were</text>
  <text start="643.26" dur="5.62">so something&amp;#39;s wrong here now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="646.33" dur="5.82">very interesting is that Tim young</text>
  <text start="648.88" dur="5.67">tweeted out that NBC the New York Times</text>
  <text start="652.15" dur="4.5">and The Washington Post passed on the</text>
  <text start="654.55" dur="4.92">Ronan Pharos Cavanaugh accuser story</text>
  <text start="656.65" dur="3.77">because reporters felt uneasy about the</text>
  <text start="659.47" dur="4.619">facts</text>
  <text start="660.42" dur="6.16">think about that NBC the New York Times</text>
  <text start="664.089" dur="4.831">in the Washington Post all passed on a</text>
  <text start="666.58" dur="5.94">story that could have made Trump kavanah</text>
  <text start="668.92" dur="6.57">look bad but they knew they didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="672.52" dur="7.7">the facts something was wrong here</text>
  <text start="675.49" dur="4.73">there&amp;#39;s a lot of gaps in the story so</text>
  <text start="680.46" dur="5.86">judiciary chairman Grassley he released</text>
