  <text start="177.76" dur="3.87">later this month</text>
  <text start="179.25" dur="4.81">WikiLeaks rushed to clarify the matter</text>
  <text start="181.63" dur="4.59">stating that the Australian was</text>
  <text start="184.06" dur="2.93">approached on a number of occasions to</text>
  <text start="186.22" dur="4.4">offer his</text>
  <text start="186.99" dur="5.4">expert opinion two British MPs during</text>
  <text start="190.62" dur="3.51">the last attempt on Monday the</text>
  <text start="192.39" dur="3.45">Investigative Committee allegedly</text>
  <text start="194.13" dur="4.68">proposed holding the session with</text>
  <text start="195.84" dur="5.54">Assange on March 28th via videolink</text>
  <text start="198.81" dur="5.58">to which mr. Assange agreed in addition</text>
  <text start="201.38" dur="6.1">to Assange the committee headed by MP</text>
  <text start="204.39" dur="6.3">Damian Collins has requested Facebook</text>
  <text start="207.48" dur="6.12">CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify in person</text>
  <text start="210.69" dur="5.79">on the Cambridge analytical data scandal</text>
  <text start="213.6" dur="5.22">now before Zuckerberg appears before the</text>
  <text start="216.48" dur="5.07">British MPs Facebook announced that it</text>
  <text start="218.82" dur="6.63">is working round the clock to gather and</text>
  <text start="221.55" dur="5.73">analyze all the facts and we can see</text>
  <text start="225.45" dur="4.2">right now Facebook is saying we have</text>
  <text start="227.28" dur="3.06">been deceived and we don&amp;#39;t know how this</text>
  <text start="229.65" dur="5.03">happened</text>
  <text start="230.34" dur="7.62">and basically this isn&amp;#39;t exactly true</text>
  <text start="234.68" dur="6.97">they knew what they had done two years</text>
  <text start="237.96" dur="8.93">ago and only acted against them when it</text>
  <text start="241.65" dur="8.13">was reported in the press remember other</text>
  <text start="246.89" dur="7.93">campaigns did the same thing with</text>
  <text start="249.78" dur="8.73">Facebook&amp;#39;s data now this is very</text>
  <text start="254.82" dur="6.57">interesting because they and others</text>
  <text start="258.51" dur="6.56">social media Giants search engines have</text>
  <text start="261.39" dur="8.01">been collecting information on people</text>
  <text start="265.07" dur="8.17">your private information and selling it</text>
  <text start="269.4" dur="6.66">and having other companies use it and we</text>
  <text start="273.24" dur="5.22">can see right now that they&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="276.06" dur="4.11">caught there they&amp;#39;re caught in the act</text>
  <text start="278.46" dur="3.93">and they&amp;#39;re trying to blame it on</text>
  <text start="280.17" dur="5.76">another company but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="282.39" dur="6.96">here is that things really don&amp;#39;t add up</text>
  <text start="285.93" dur="6">Alistair McTaggart said right now</text>
  <text start="289.35" dur="5.04">Facebook&amp;#39;s money is saying something</text>
  <text start="291.93" dur="4.92">different than what they are telling the</text>
  <text start="294.39" dur="7.35">world now what they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="296.85" dur="7.89">here is that Facebook Google and others</text>
  <text start="301.74" dur="5.37">well they&amp;#39;re pumping in millions of</text>
  <text start="304.74" dur="4.95">dollars into halting new laws in</text>
  <text start="307.11" dur="6.21">California which would expand online</text>
  <text start="309.69" dur="6.56">privacy protections and Google and the</text>
  <text start="313.32" dur="5.01">rest Facebook don&amp;#39;t want this to happen</text>
  <text start="316.25" dur="3.88">basically the Act would require</text>
  <text start="318.33" dur="2.37">companies to disclose what personal</text>
  <text start="320.13" dur="2.67">information</text>
  <text start="320.7" dur="4.44">California&amp;#39;s tech companies could</text>
  <text start="322.8" dur="4.83">collect buy or share it would allow</text>
  <text start="325.14" dur="4.14">consumers to opt out from those</text>
  <text start="327.63" dur="3.84">practices and would prevent businesses</text>
  <text start="329.28" dur="5.46">from charging a higher price to those</text>
  <text start="331.47" dur="5.49">who make that choice and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="334.74" dur="4.98">this to happen they need the data they</text>
  <text start="336.96" dur="5.79">want the data remember a lot of these</text>
  <text start="339.72" dur="5.93">social media giant search engines are</text>
  <text start="342.75" dur="6.36">tied in with the Intelligence Agency&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="345.65" dur="6.37">McTaggart also wrote well something else</text>
  <text start="349.11" dur="5.55">doesn&amp;#39;t add up here if you have claimed</text>
  <text start="352.02" dur="5.82">that Cambridge analytical data breach</text>
  <text start="354.66" dur="6.06">was not a breach and that you do not</text>
  <text start="357.84" dur="5.37">sell users personal information but</text>
  <text start="360.72" dur="4.26">either it was a breach or a sale if not</text>
  <text start="363.21" dur="4.47">a breach we are forced to conclude that</text>
  <text start="364.98" dur="4.26">Facebook sold Cambridge analytic access</text>
  <text start="367.68" dur="5.01">to over 50 million users personal</text>
  <text start="369.24" dur="4.73">information most of whom never consented</text>
  <text start="372.69" dur="5.49">to having their personal information</text>
  <text start="373.97" dur="6.6">shared Facebook is caught in the middle</text>
  <text start="378.18" dur="4.05">of all of this because it&amp;#39;s either</text>
  <text start="380.57" dur="3.88">Cambridge which they&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="382.23" dur="4.62">show that they accessed their data</text>
  <text start="384.45" dur="5.7">illegally or Facebook gave them</text>
  <text start="386.85" dur="6.72">permission and charged a fee they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="390.15" dur="8.64">stuck here q was talking about this on</text>
  <text start="393.57" dur="8.69">how these big tech companies use your</text>
  <text start="398.79" dur="6.41">personal data I mean think about it</text>
  <text start="402.26" dur="6.52">future proves past</text>
  <text start="405.2" dur="5.02">he already q I mean whoever the Q is we</text>
  <text start="408.78" dur="4.71">know it&amp;#39;s made up of probably the</text>
  <text start="410.22" dur="6.33">President and other Patriots within the</text>
  <text start="413.49" dur="5.46">Oval Office but what we&amp;#39;re seeing here</text>
  <text start="416.55" dur="5">is they already told you that this was</text>
  <text start="418.95" dur="5.31">going to happen and it just happened and</text>
  <text start="421.55" dur="6.58">they also told you that these</text>
  <text start="424.26" dur="7.71">individuals are going to sell off their</text>
  <text start="428.13" dur="8.28">shares watch the money watch what they</text>

  <text start="440.01" dur="5.61">regularly scheduled program that was the</text>
  <text start="443.04" dur="5.91">most insider selling for any public</text>
  <text start="445.62" dur="4.89">company going back as far as 3 months in</text>

  <text start="470.82" dur="6.12">nearly two hundred and ten million</text>
  <text start="472.71" dur="6.72">dollars because Facebook they could face</text>
  <text start="476.94" dur="5.76">fines right now that could reach two</text>
  <text start="479.43" dur="6.51">trillion dollars because people are</text>
  <text start="482.7" dur="6.72">going to sue and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="485.94" dur="7.47">that this would mean like up to $40,000</text>

  <text start="496.98" dur="4.46">everyone&amp;#39;s gonna sue but I mean this is</text>
  <text start="499.2" dur="5.31">something that&amp;#39;s gonna be out there</text>
  <text start="501.44" dur="6.4">might be a class action type of soup and</text>
  <text start="504.51" dur="6.69">it might bring this company down why do</text>

  <text start="555.42" dur="6.06">they had constructive talks and we can</text>
  <text start="559.41" dur="3.9">see right now these were unofficial</text>
  <text start="561.48" dur="3.93">diplomatic talks in the Nordic country</text>
  <text start="563.31" dur="4.32">that were widely believed to be laying</text>
  <text start="565.41" dur="4.71">the groundwork for an upcoming meeting</text>
  <text start="567.63" dur="4.92">between the Koreas and the u.s. North</text>
  <text start="570.12" dur="3.9">Korea summit and the Finnish foreign</text>

  <text start="574.02" dur="4.74">that the talks were held in a positive</text>
  <text start="576.66" dur="4.19">atmosphere and were aimed at building</text>
  <text start="578.76" dur="5.4">confidence and reducing tensions on the</text>
  <text start="580.85" dur="6.4">Korean Peninsula the peace talks have</text>
  <text start="584.16" dur="3.84">already started they&amp;#39;re laying the</text>
  <text start="587.25" dur="3.24">groundwork</text>
  <text start="588" dur="5.06">pretty soon you&amp;#39;re going to hear that</text>
  <text start="590.49" dur="5.31">there&amp;#39;s peace within that region and</text>
  <text start="593.06" dur="4.96">again they&amp;#39;re saying that there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="595.8" dur="4.05">to be some type of drill on April 1st</text>
  <text start="598.02" dur="3.57">which is April Fool&amp;#39;s Day and we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="599.85" dur="4.85">to see if this is an April Fool&amp;#39;s joke</text>
  <text start="601.59" dur="5.79">or the president is showing that look</text>
  <text start="604.7" dur="6.7">you can have the drills we can do it</text>
  <text start="607.38" dur="5.79">North Korea won&amp;#39;t do anything they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="611.4" dur="4.29">have a missile test they won&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="613.17" dur="6.02">nuclear test but we&amp;#39;ll see how this all</text>
  <text start="615.69" dur="9.15">plays out we see right now Iraq is</text>
  <text start="619.19" dur="9.07">looking to work with Turkey on securing</text>
  <text start="624.84" dur="6.75">the border the Iraqi government says</text>
  <text start="628.26" dur="5.82">they are ready to work with Turkey this</text>
  <text start="631.59" dur="5.19">is very interesting because a year ago</text>
  <text start="634.08" dur="5.34">Iraq was saying they want Turkey out of</text>
  <text start="636.78" dur="4.5">the area this is unbelievable we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="639.42" dur="5.12">agree with Turkey now they want to work</text>
  <text start="641.28" dur="6.3">with Turkey in securing the borders</text>
  <text start="644.54" dur="5.73">what&amp;#39;s happening here is each one of</text>
  <text start="647.58" dur="5.97">these countries they are now governing</text>
  <text start="650.27" dur="6.43">themselves a lot of the deep state is</text>
  <text start="653.55" dur="4.98">out of this region they&amp;#39;re no longer in</text>
  <text start="656.7" dur="4.29">control this is why the Iraqi forces</text>
  <text start="658.53" dur="4.35">were able to defeat the Islamic state in</text>
  <text start="660.99" dur="3.81">their country because the deef state</text>
  <text start="662.88" dur="4.8">used to point them in wrong directions</text>
  <text start="664.8" dur="4.95">give them misinformation and this is why</text>
  <text start="667.68" dur="3.27">they never could get anywhere now these</text>
  <text start="669.75" dur="4.56">countries are saying you know something</text>
  <text start="670.95" dur="5.25">we can govern ourselves and we can have</text>
  <text start="674.31" dur="4.17">communication with other countries we</text>
  <text start="676.2" dur="5.19">can secure our borders and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="678.48" dur="5.96">to see this happen we also see that the</text>
  <text start="681.39" dur="7.41">Syrian Armed Forces well they have</text>
  <text start="684.44" dur="6.34">liberated certain towns from the</text>
  <text start="688.8" dur="5.19">militants from the rebels from the paid</text>
  <text start="690.78" dur="6.27">mercenaries and they found chemical</text>
  <text start="693.99" dur="5.4">weapon production facilities and 40 tons</text>
  <text start="697.05" dur="6.27">of poisonous substance chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="699.39" dur="8.07">in these areas this should tell you</text>
  <text start="703.32" dur="6.269">something that these rebels these paid</text>
  <text start="707.46" dur="5.73">mercenaries controlled by the deep state</text>
  <text start="709.589" dur="6.241">had the facilities had the chemical</text>
  <text start="713.19" dur="4.92">weapons and I&amp;#39;m sure if you do a little</text>
  <text start="715.83" dur="4.65">investigation you will find out it was</text>
  <text start="718.11" dur="3.69">the paid mercenaries that use the</text>
  <text start="720.48" dur="3.99">chemical attacks which we</text>
  <text start="721.8" dur="6.38">kind of already know we see right now</text>
  <text start="724.47" dur="7.14">there&amp;#39;s a lot of Washington insider</text>
  <text start="728.18" dur="6.79">government officials that are flocking</text>
  <text start="731.61" dur="5.97">to doomsday camps around the country</text>
  <text start="734.97" dur="5.309">which of course begs the question what</text>
  <text start="737.58" dur="5.16">do they know that we do not they are</text>
  <text start="740.279" dur="4.021">building a network of backwoods doomsday</text>
  <text start="742.74" dur="4.88">camps around the country and are pulling</text>
  <text start="744.3" dur="5.4">in members from affluent areas and</text>
  <text start="747.62" dur="4.6">there&amp;#39;s high-powered government</text>
  <text start="749.7" dur="5.96">officials there are many others now</text>
  <text start="752.22" dur="6.21">moving to these areas now number one is</text>
  <text start="755.66" dur="6.01">the deep state planning something huge</text>
  <text start="758.43" dur="6.77">like a cyber attack on the power</text>
  <text start="761.67" dur="7.02">infrastructure a cyber attack on the</text>
  <text start="765.2" dur="6.16">financial system because this is one</text>
  <text start="768.69" dur="5.399">reason they would go into hiding into</text>
  <text start="771.36" dur="6.419">bunkers to make sure they have power</text>
  <text start="774.089" dur="7.231">outside of the system and to be off grid</text>
  <text start="777.779" dur="6.151">and we can see that this I wouldn&amp;#39;t put</text>
  <text start="781.32" dur="3.17">it past the deep state to take it this</text>
  <text start="783.93" dur="3.24">far</text>
  <text start="784.49" dur="5.289">now will they be able to do it we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="787.17" dur="5.22">know because we could see right now the</text>
  <text start="789.779" dur="4.951">control I do believe is in the corner of</text>
  <text start="792.39" dur="4.49">Trump and the Patriots and I think the</text>
  <text start="794.73" dur="4.74">deep state is continually losing control</text>
  <text start="796.88" dur="6.07">quite quickly but it doesn&amp;#39;t mean they</text>
  <text start="799.47" dur="5.16">have they&amp;#39;ve given up it means that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="802.95" dur="3.27">getting more and more difficult as time</text>
  <text start="804.63" dur="5.399">goes on now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="806.22" dur="8.7">that cue came out and Q said the FBI has</text>
  <text start="810.029" dur="8.81">opened a case on Q so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="814.92" dur="8.43">coordinating to end the communication of</text>
  <text start="818.839" dur="6.721">Q and Q said this is predictable they</text>
  <text start="823.35" dur="4.16">are scared they&amp;#39;re trying to stop all</text>
  <text start="825.56" dur="4.93">information coming out</text>
  <text start="827.51" dur="5.71">they said they they will fail in doing</text>
  <text start="830.49" dur="5.31">this they already know the details of</text>
  <text start="833.22" dur="5.25">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do and this is</text>
  <text start="835.8" dur="6.029">very interesting that they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="838.47" dur="5.359">do this and it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="841.829" dur="6.301">because Q keeps mentioning</text>
  <text start="843.829" dur="6.341">boom-boom-boom mentioning Texas we also</text>
  <text start="848.13" dur="5.16">mentioned some type of an event</text>
  <text start="850.17" dur="5.4">happening on March 18th or somewhere</text>
  <text start="853.29" dur="7.07">around that area in Texas and</text>
  <text start="855.57" dur="9">we did have a bombing in this area and</text>
  <text start="860.36" dur="6.64">the bombs were out of the FedEx area and</text>
  <text start="864.57" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s very interesting because if we go</text>
  <text start="867" dur="5.49">back a month or two to an event that</text>
  <text start="870" dur="5.04">occurred we understand that like Dick&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="872.49" dur="5.19">Sporting Goods and other corporations</text>
  <text start="875.04" dur="5.55">decided to end the relationship with the</text>
  <text start="877.68" dur="5.67">NRA and there was a push to get FedEx</text>
  <text start="880.59" dur="5.67">Amazon and others to end their</text>
  <text start="883.35" dur="4.65">relationship with the NRA and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="886.26" dur="4.2">know if this had anything to do with</text>
  <text start="888" dur="4.11">that but it&amp;#39;s very interesting that this</text>
  <text start="890.46" dur="4.26">is where they decided to send the bombs</text>
  <text start="892.11" dur="4.71">out right now there&amp;#39;s no motive was this</text>
  <text start="894.72" dur="4.74">individual control just like the</text>
  <text start="896.82" dur="5.49">individual was controlled outside of the</text>
  <text start="899.46" dur="5.67">White House who committed suicide and Q</text>
  <text start="902.31" dur="5.31">did mention that where Q said you know</text>
  <text start="905.13" dur="4.47">Bay Control we can control the innocence</text>
  <text start="907.62" dur="4.47">and they can make the innocence do</text>
  <text start="909.6" dur="5.43">whatever they want so this might be a</text>
  <text start="912.09" dur="6.63">link into that now Q also said other</text>
  <text start="915.03" dur="6.24">things in his post that he put out he</text>
  <text start="918.72" dur="5.93">said MZ which is most likely Mark</text>
  <text start="921.27" dur="7.5">Zuckerberg RT which is Rex Tillerson</text>
  <text start="924.65" dur="6.79">they had a meeting together cell phones</text>
  <text start="928.77" dur="6.09">were left at the door so nobody could</text>
  <text start="931.44" dur="6.66">record take pictures or anything else in</text>
  <text start="934.86" dur="7.56">their private meeting he also Q also</text>
  <text start="938.1" dur="7.32">said plus 8/5 political individuals</text>
  <text start="942.42" dur="8.61">within this meeting one former Intel</text>
  <text start="945.42" dur="9.09">director trying to mask or spin what is</text>
  <text start="951.03" dur="5.79">happening and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="954.51" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re trying to shift the narrative</text>
  <text start="956.82" dur="6.21">and Q says this is going to completely</text>
  <text start="958.35" dur="9.75">fail because Q says we hear you we have</text>
  <text start="963.03" dur="7.95">the algorithm Thank You Snowden so</text>
  <text start="968.1" dur="7.79">Snowden right now like we&amp;#39;ve said in the</text>
  <text start="970.98" dur="7.2">past is working with Q with the Patriots</text>
  <text start="975.89" dur="6.31">supplying them with information now</text>
  <text start="978.18" dur="7.58">Snowden there&amp;#39;s some talk that he even</text>
  <text start="982.2" dur="7.08">might he might have those sex tapes of</text>
  <text start="985.76" dur="3.79">Hillary Clinton and he&amp;#39;s holding on to</text>
  <text start="989.28" dur="2.249">the</text>
  <text start="989.55" dur="4.789">this is why they&amp;#39;ve been trying to get</text>
  <text start="991.529" dur="6.631">him so badly</text>
  <text start="994.339" dur="8.341">andcue went on to say learn chest down</text>
  <text start="998.16" dur="9.919">she goes which is very interesting</text>
  <text start="1002.68" dur="9.49">nobody escapes this nobody they are all</text>
  <text start="1008.079" dur="9.841">panicking so we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="1012.17" dur="7.919">that the deep state they are regrouping</text>
  <text start="1017.92" dur="3.76">they&amp;#39;re a little bit worried they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1020.089" dur="3.75">trying to ship the narrative they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1021.68" dur="4.409">panicking they&amp;#39;re backed into a corner</text>
  <text start="1023.839" dur="4.171">and at the same time this is all</text>
  <text start="1026.089" dur="4.74">happening and they&amp;#39;re racing against</text>
  <text start="1028.01" dur="5.819">time right now because Trump is pushing</text>
  <text start="1030.829" dur="6.87">with Patriots to bring down the economy</text>
  <text start="1033.829" dur="6.781">to get rid of the central banking system</text>
  <text start="1037.699" dur="4.921">this is the system that funds their</text>
  <text start="1040.61" dur="5.459">operations they&amp;#39;re gonna cut them off at</text>
  <text start="1042.62" dur="6.84">the source just like the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1046.069" dur="5.581">was shut down after Russia took out the</text>
  <text start="1049.46" dur="4.83">oil convoys they couldn&amp;#39;t sell the oil</text>
  <text start="1051.65" dur="4.83">they weren&amp;#39;t making any money you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1054.29" dur="4.95">making any money guess what it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1056.48" dur="5.939">hard to recruit more individuals to get</text>
  <text start="1059.24" dur="6">the assets they need and things start to</text>
  <text start="1062.419" dur="6.361">fall apart rapidly the same thing here</text>
  <text start="1065.24" dur="7.14">and they realize that the good guys the</text>
  <text start="1068.78" dur="6">Patriots they are taking control they</text>
  <text start="1072.38" dur="5.22">see everything now they hear everything</text>
  <text start="1074.78" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re using the same exact tactics the</text>
  <text start="1077.6" dur="5.55">deep state did when they were in power</text>
  <text start="1079.49" dur="7.41">they&amp;#39;re no longer in power and this is a</text>
  <text start="1083.15" dur="6.56">problem for them and once again we need</text>
  <text start="1086.9" dur="6.54">to keep in mind that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1089.71" dur="6.99">flocking to these doomsday bunkers they</text>
  <text start="1093.44" dur="5.34">might try the event of all events</text>
  <text start="1096.7" dur="4.719">hopefully this could be stopped before</text>
  <text start="1098.78" dur="5.97">it happens but they are getting prepared</text>
  <text start="1101.419" dur="7.551">for this they understand what they will</text>
  <text start="1104.75" dur="7.86">do in the end to try to shift and change</text>
  <text start="1108.97" dur="8.32">the narrative completely and try to</text>
  <text start="1112.61" dur="8.16">regain their power so we can see this is</text>
  <text start="1117.29" dur="6.15">a battle it&amp;#39;s being waged right in front</text>
  <text start="1120.77" dur="4.859">of our eyes and we&amp;#39;re going to see this</text>
  <text start="1123.44" dur="4.589">celery as we move throughout this year</text>
  <text start="1125.629" dur="5.67">because things are just going to reach a</text>
  <text start="1128.029" dur="5.701">point where both sides are gonna clash</text>
  <text start="1131.299" dur="7.021">like really hard right in front of us</text>
  <text start="1133.73" dur="8.299">and if the deep state is feeling that</text>
  <text start="1138.32" dur="7.29">they&amp;#39;re losing which they are right now</text>
  <text start="1142.029" dur="6.341">they&amp;#39;re gonna resort to their doomsday</text>
  <text start="1145.61" dur="6.179">event because they have nothing else</text>
  <text start="1148.37" dur="5.34">they have nothing else to do except to</text>
  <text start="1151.789" dur="3.571">pull the trigger and everything&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1153.71" dur="3.569">set up maybe it&amp;#39;s been dismantled</text>
  <text start="1155.36" dur="3.96">maybe they&amp;#39;ll pull the trigger and they</text>
  <text start="1157.279" dur="3.661">think the malware is gonna you know move</text>
  <text start="1159.32" dur="3.75">into the systems into the financial</text>
  <text start="1160.94" dur="4.29">system into the power infrastructure and</text>
  <text start="1163.07" dur="4.079">maybe that whole thing will flop I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1165.23" dur="4.89">sure they have a back-up plan where</text>
  <text start="1167.149" dur="6.171">they&amp;#39;ll have physical events instead of</text>
  <text start="1170.12" dur="5.88">cyber attacks instead of that type of</text>
  <text start="1173.32" dur="4.449">scenario where they&amp;#39;ll have to take it</text>
  <text start="1176" dur="3.659">to the next level and this is their</text>
  <text start="1177.769" dur="5.16">back-up plan because we can see right</text>
  <text start="1179.659" dur="6.211">now at each turn they&amp;#39;re false flags</text>
  <text start="1182.929" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re not working too well they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1185.87" dur="4.86">going as planned a lot of clues a lot of</text>

  <text start="1190.73" dur="3.899">picking up on it now</text>
  <text start="1191.899" dur="3.99">so we&amp;#39;re gonna watch this we can see</text>

  <text start="1195.889" dur="5.851">queue we can see that things are really</text>
  <text start="1198.379" dur="6.03">starting to ramp up and we know the deep</text>
