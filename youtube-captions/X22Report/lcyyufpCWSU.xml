  <text start="100.38" dur="5.31">take a domestic dollar which is going to</text>
  <text start="102.869" dur="5.25">be devalued and that&amp;#39;s when he says the</text>
  <text start="105.69" dur="4.849">crisis is going to begin so if you have</text>
  <text start="108.119" dur="5.1">some time go on over to either the</text>

  <text start="115.77" dur="4.86">he has to say let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="118.259" dur="6.061">economic collapse political ng of</text>
  <text start="120.63" dur="7.169">political news now since Trump tweeted</text>
  <text start="124.32" dur="7.56">out that Obama was in charge of ordering</text>
  <text start="127.799" dur="7.141">a wiretap on Trump Tower and spying on</text>
  <text start="131.88" dur="5.22">him before the elections we can see that</text>
  <text start="134.94" dur="3.06">the corporate media they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="137.1" dur="3.63">saying this is absolutely ridiculous</text>
  <text start="138" dur="6">there&amp;#39;s no proof there&amp;#39;s nothing there</text>
  <text start="140.73" dur="6.39">and we know that Obama went to the FISA</text>
  <text start="144" dur="6.12">Court multiple times and tried to get</text>
  <text start="147.12" dur="5.91">this order so senator Graham and Senator</text>
  <text start="150.12" dur="5.209">Whitehouse they&amp;#39;re requesting the</text>
  <text start="153.03" dur="4.86">warrant application and court order</text>
  <text start="155.329" dur="5.44">related to the possible wiretapping of</text>
  <text start="157.89" dur="7.17">Trump and a strong campaign or Trump</text>
  <text start="160.769" dur="6.211">Tower and they&amp;#39;re saying that we request</text>
  <text start="165.06" dur="4.829">that the Department of Justice provide</text>
  <text start="166.98" dur="5.099">us copies of any warrant application and</text>
  <text start="169.889" dur="4.38">court orders redacted as necessary to</text>
  <text start="172.079" dur="4.141">protect intelligence sources and methods</text>
  <text start="174.269" dur="3.921">that may be compromised by disclosure</text>
  <text start="176.22" dur="4.68">and to protect any ongoing</text>
  <text start="178.19" dur="4.379">investigations related to wiretaps of</text>
  <text start="180.9" dur="5.869">President Trump</text>
  <text start="182.569" dur="8.521">and these senators want some proof to</text>
  <text start="186.769" dur="6.92">show that this actually happened now we</text>
  <text start="191.09" dur="6.259">have to realize what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="193.689" dur="7.27">they want to see the actual paperwork</text>
  <text start="197.349" dur="6.901">now will the FBI and the agency&amp;#39;s hand</text>
  <text start="200.959" dur="7.051">this over well if they do hand it over</text>
  <text start="204.25" dur="6.159">it implicates them into spying on an</text>
  <text start="208.01" dur="6.119">American citizen who was running to be</text>
  <text start="210.409" dur="4.98">President of the United States and they</text>
  <text start="214.129" dur="4.44">then I have to look at the wording of</text>
  <text start="215.389" dur="7.83">the warrant to find out what was the</text>
  <text start="218.569" dur="7.92">purpose and who actually initiated all</text>
  <text start="223.219" dur="7.02">of this and this is going to be a major</text>
  <text start="226.489" dur="6.661">problem so are we going to see this</text>
  <text start="230.239" dur="5.43">proof we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see and if</text>
  <text start="233.15" dur="5.309">we do this is going to be a problem now</text>
  <text start="235.669" dur="4.891">does Trump actually have the paperwork I</text>
  <text start="238.459" dur="4.53">would say that he must have seen the</text>
  <text start="240.56" dur="5.639">paperwork or he must have the paperwork</text>
  <text start="242.989" dur="6.661">because like I said in past reports if</text>
  <text start="246.199" dur="6.93">he cannot prove this if he cannot</text>
  <text start="249.65" dur="5.64">support what he&amp;#39;s saying the corporate</text>
  <text start="253.129" dur="5.07">media the deep state they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="255.29" dur="6.96">calling him a liar and no one will</text>
  <text start="258.199" dur="6.451">believe him from this point on so most</text>
  <text start="262.25" dur="6.81">likely he must have seen the paperwork</text>
  <text start="264.65" dur="6.9">most likely he has the proof and we know</text>
  <text start="269.06" dur="7.59">from all other information that&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="271.55" dur="8.04">in that there is a paper trail now we</text>
  <text start="276.65" dur="5.759">know that WikiLeaks they pushed out this</text>
  <text start="279.59" dur="6.9">thing called volt seven and they showed</text>
  <text start="282.409" dur="5.701">that the CIA was spying on everyone</text>
  <text start="286.49" dur="5.72">pretty much because they were using</text>
  <text start="288.11" dur="6.779">devices Android phones iphone samsung TV</text>
  <text start="292.21" dur="4.72">they&amp;#39;re able to remote control cars</text>
  <text start="294.889" dur="4.641">they&amp;#39;re able to do a lot of different</text>
  <text start="296.93" dur="6.209">things and we&amp;#39;ve talked about this over</text>
  <text start="299.53" dur="6.879">many different reports on how they are</text>
  <text start="303.139" dur="5.761">able to use your device to spy on you</text>
  <text start="306.409" dur="5.581">now since this came out it looks like</text>
  <text start="308.9" dur="4.82">Samsung well they&amp;#39;re studying the media</text>
  <text start="311.99" dur="4.07">reports citing</text>
  <text start="313.72" dur="5.52">that they need to look in what is going</text>
  <text start="316.06" dur="7.65">on here and they need to understand how</text>
  <text start="319.24" dur="7.95">the CIA was able to use their devices to</text>
  <text start="323.71" dur="6.21">spy on people now I don&amp;#39;t think the CIA</text>
  <text start="327.19" dur="4.98">was able to do this by themselves they</text>
  <text start="329.92" dur="4.35">need a cooperation from the corporations</text>
  <text start="332.17" dur="3.72">because most of the code and what</text>
  <text start="334.27" dur="6.98">they&amp;#39;ve been doing is already embedded</text>
  <text start="335.89" dur="9.45">in the chips so Samsung is most likely</text>
  <text start="341.25" dur="10.06">covering themselves at this point but we</text>
  <text start="345.34" dur="9.66">can see that all this time the CIA the</text>
  <text start="351.31" dur="6.81">NSA they had the ability to listen in</text>
  <text start="355" dur="8">read emails to spy on every single</text>
  <text start="358.12" dur="8.76">person now do you understand why the FBI</text>
  <text start="363" dur="6.31">the NSA didn&amp;#39;t want people to have</text>
  <text start="366.88" dur="4.98">encryption it wasn&amp;#39;t that they were</text>
  <text start="369.31" dur="4.65">breaking encryption and trying to get</text>
  <text start="371.86" dur="4.44">your information it was because</text>
  <text start="373.96" dur="5.15">everything was already open to them and</text>
  <text start="376.3" dur="6.63">if something was encrypted like an email</text>
  <text start="379.11" dur="5.559">well they would get the encrypted email</text>
  <text start="382.93" dur="3.23">but they wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to open it</text>
  <text start="384.669" dur="5.461">because they wouldn&amp;#39;t have the key and</text>
  <text start="386.16" dur="5.53">they wouldn&amp;#39;t have the method and this</text>
  <text start="390.13" dur="3.75">would be very difficult for them and</text>
  <text start="391.69" dur="6.96">this is why they continually tried to</text>
  <text start="393.88" dur="8.4">fight encryption and of course we know</text>
  <text start="398.65" dur="5.94">they already basically infiltrated</text>
  <text start="402.28" dur="3.42">certain encryption techniques but not</text>
  <text start="404.59" dur="4.11">all of them if you create them</text>
  <text start="405.7" dur="6.21">yourselves or there are companies out</text>
  <text start="408.7" dur="6.09">there that will help you in creating</text>
  <text start="411.91" dur="4.35">encryption code there are email systems</text>
  <text start="414.79" dur="6.12">that will allow you to encrypt your</text>
  <text start="416.26" dur="7.02">email where the CIA the NSA can&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="420.91" dur="3.93">get into I mean eventually with super</text>
  <text start="423.28" dur="2.25">computers they can probably do it but</text>
  <text start="424.84" dur="2.7">they&amp;#39;re not going to waste their time</text>
  <text start="425.53" dur="4.44">doing that they want easy access as we</text>
  <text start="427.54" dur="6.72">can see but we can see what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="429.97" dur="7.14">trying to do all these years now the</text>
  <text start="434.26" dur="7.68">other things that we&amp;#39;re in this vault</text>
  <text start="437.11" dur="6.51">seven showed us that the CIA they have</text>
  <text start="441.94" dur="5.27">the ability to mimic foreign</text>
  <text start="443.62" dur="6.299">intelligence agencies by leaving</text>
  <text start="447.21" dur="5.019">electronic fingerprints creating the</text>
  <text start="449.919" dur="7.101">false impression of foreign intrusion</text>
  <text start="452.229" dur="6.991">into computer networks and basically</text>
  <text start="457.02" dur="3.22">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been told and</text>
  <text start="459.22" dur="3.59">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been looked at</text>
  <text start="460.24" dur="6.39">needs to be questioned once again</text>
  <text start="462.81" dur="6.94">because we can&amp;#39;t really believe what</text>
  <text start="466.63" dur="6.2">they say now well we never could but all</text>
  <text start="469.75" dur="8.25">the corporate media headlines of Iran</text>
  <text start="472.83" dur="8.47">Syria North Korea Russia China everyone</text>
  <text start="478" dur="6.9">hacking into our systems here in the</text>
  <text start="481.3" dur="5.97">United States well it looks like really</text>
  <text start="484.9" dur="5.72">they might not all be true and most</text>
  <text start="487.27" dur="8.16">likely they&amp;#39;re not but there&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="490.62" dur="8.77">issue to all of this if there is an open</text>
  <text start="495.43" dur="7.29">door to all these things to your phone</text>
  <text start="499.39" dur="7.23">to your TV&amp;#39;s to your devices this allows</text>
  <text start="502.72" dur="7.819">back doors for criminals and it allows</text>
  <text start="506.62" dur="8.76">them to get in and see your information</text>
  <text start="510.539" dur="9.971">so they&amp;#39;re responsible for breaking</text>
  <text start="515.38" dur="8.88">security on all these devices and what</text>
  <text start="520.51" dur="5.96">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that coming</text>
  <text start="524.26" dur="5.34">from the CIA according to wiki leaks</text>
  <text start="526.47" dur="5.17">that they lost control of the majority</text>
  <text start="529.6" dur="4.26">of its hacking arsenal including malware</text>
  <text start="531.64" dur="4.98">viruses Trojans weaponized zero-day</text>
  <text start="533.86" dur="5.64">exploits malware remote control systems</text>
  <text start="536.62" dur="4.56">and associated documentation now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="539.5" dur="2.88">thinking they probably did this on</text>
  <text start="541.18" dur="3.15">purpose where they&amp;#39;re out there saying</text>
  <text start="542.38" dur="4.5">that they lost complete control because</text>
  <text start="544.33" dur="4.83">if anything happens or anything should</text>
  <text start="546.88" dur="4.68">happen in the future they can&amp;#39;t be held</text>
  <text start="549.16" dur="4.41">responsible or even things in the past</text>
  <text start="551.56" dur="6.029">because they can say hey it was stolen</text>
  <text start="553.57" dur="7.2">from us we didn&amp;#39;t do this and when we</text>
  <text start="557.589" dur="6.691">look at all this I mean the CIA can pose</text>
  <text start="560.77" dur="7.83">as Russian hackers they can recompile</text>
  <text start="564.28" dur="7.71">the code and say that hey it was Russia</text>
  <text start="568.6" dur="5.97">who did this we see the fingerprint now</text>
  <text start="571.99" dur="5.94">there are certain documents within hear</text>
  <text start="574.57" dur="4.889">that tell you do&amp;#39;s and don&amp;#39;ts when</text>
  <text start="577.93" dur="4.17">you&amp;#39;re developing</text>
  <text start="579.459" dur="4.891">and one of them says hackers and code</text>
  <text start="582.1" dur="6.089">writers are warned do not leave data in</text>
  <text start="584.35" dur="5.76">binary file that demonstrates CIA US</text>
  <text start="588.189" dur="3.781">government or partner companies</text>
  <text start="590.11" dur="4.199">involvement in the creation or use of</text>
  <text start="591.97" dur="3.959">the binary tool so basically what</text>
  <text start="594.309" dur="6.481">they&amp;#39;re saying is when you&amp;#39;re compiling</text>
  <text start="595.929" dur="8.4">a piece of malware a virus or anything</text>
  <text start="600.79" dur="5.88">make sure there&amp;#39;s no link back to the</text>
  <text start="604.329" dur="4.471">CIA make sure the fingerprint says</text>
  <text start="606.67" dur="3.57">Russia China and the others whoever</text>
  <text start="608.8" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re trying to set up but make sure</text>
  <text start="610.24" dur="5.49">there&amp;#39;s nothing else in there now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="613.36" dur="5.659">very interesting about all of this where</text>
  <text start="615.73" dur="5.579">the vault seven documents were released</text>
  <text start="619.019" dur="3.641">people have been looking at it a lot of</text>
  <text start="621.309" dur="3.96">the alternative media is out there</text>
  <text start="622.66" dur="6.44">reporting on how the CIA has been spying</text>
  <text start="625.269" dur="6.57">on every single American in this country</text>
  <text start="629.1" dur="5.26">the corporate media saying that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="631.839" dur="6.631">know if this is real this I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="634.36" dur="7.909">believe this it can&amp;#39;t be true we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="638.47" dur="7.2">the activist groups out there protesting</text>
  <text start="642.269" dur="6.67">saying that this is a violation of our</text>
  <text start="645.67" dur="5.49">rights I mean shouldn&amp;#39;t we have college</text>
  <text start="648.939" dur="4.171">campuses saying oh my god the government</text>
  <text start="651.16" dur="4.979">has been spying on us they can read our</text>
  <text start="653.11" dur="7.469">email it is true the documents are out</text>
  <text start="656.139" dur="7.5">there there&amp;#39;s nothing so far not even a</text>
  <text start="660.579" dur="5.7">peep and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s amazing because</text>
  <text start="663.639" dur="6.18">if we look at the Fourth Amendment and</text>
  <text start="666.279" dur="5.93">we know that the CIA the NSA well they</text>
  <text start="669.819" dur="6.33">have been spying on us even the FBI</text>
  <text start="672.209" dur="6.461">because remember back when James clapper</text>
  <text start="676.149" dur="4.5">was questioned who was in charge of the</text>
  <text start="678.67" dur="5.009">NSA and said are you spying on the</text>
  <text start="680.649" dur="6.03">American people he lied at first to</text>
  <text start="683.679" dur="5.28">Congress and then he had to come clean</text>
  <text start="686.679" dur="3.9">saying yes and this is one Obama stepped</text>
  <text start="688.959" dur="2.73">in said well this is we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="690.579" dur="3.36">change things we&amp;#39;re going to create the</text>
  <text start="691.689" dur="6.24">USA Freedom Act well looks like</text>
  <text start="693.939" dur="6.9">nothing&amp;#39;s really changed and everything</text>
  <text start="697.929" dur="5.041">they&amp;#39;re doing is a violation of our</text>
  <text start="700.839" dur="3.87">rights all these individuals should be</text>
  <text start="702.97" dur="3.39">arrested at this point I mean look at</text>
  <text start="704.709" dur="2.97">the Fourth Amendment the right of the</text>
  <text start="706.36" dur="5.039">people to be secure in their persons</text>
  <text start="707.679" dur="5.631">houses papers and effects against</text>
  <text start="711.399" dur="5.481">unreasonable searches and see</text>
  <text start="713.31" dur="6.42">shall not be violated if you look at the</text>
  <text start="716.88" dur="4.35">Fifth Amendment and I&amp;#39;m not talking the</text>
  <text start="719.73" dur="5.48">first part I&amp;#39;m looking at the last line</text>
  <text start="721.23" dur="8.84">here nor shall private property be taken</text>
  <text start="725.21" dur="9.61">for public use without just compensation</text>
  <text start="730.07" dur="7.81">well hasn&amp;#39;t the CIA taken our personal</text>
  <text start="734.82" dur="5.64">property and use it and you have used it</text>
