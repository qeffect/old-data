  <text start="225.85" dur="5.31">see this decline as time goes on because</text>
  <text start="228.73" dur="4.8">this housing market cannot be sustained</text>
  <text start="231.16" dur="4.59">it can&amp;#39;t be sustained because most of</text>

  <text start="301.99" dur="4.53">don&amp;#39;t want the paper they want the real</text>
  <text start="304.33" dur="4.649">stuff and the only reason they want the</text>

  <text start="578.04" dur="5.71">on the States and we see right now</text>
  <text start="581.26" dur="5.579">Missouri is also doing the same thing it</text>
  <text start="583.75" dur="5.45">was shot down by the governor jay Nixon</text>

  <text start="623.8" dur="4.77">and of no effect in this state now I</text>
  <text start="626.74" dur="4.709">don&amp;#39;t know why we need all these bills</text>
  <text start="628.57" dur="4.23">protecting us from the federal laws</text>
  <text start="631.449" dur="5.341">because we have the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="632.8" dur="6.12">already it&amp;#39;s very very clear and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="636.79" dur="5.31">making this much more difficult by</text>
  <text start="638.92" dur="5.19">placing these laws to protect the rights</text>
  <text start="642.1" dur="3.81">of the people when they already have the</text>
  <text start="644.11" dur="4.95">laws here and any law that the federal</text>
  <text start="645.91" dur="5.52">government does that is in contrast to</text>
  <text start="649.06" dur="5.07">the Bill of Rights is completely null</text>
  <text start="651.43" dur="5.13">and void so I mean I mean it&amp;#39;s nice that</text>
  <text start="654.13" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re doing this and reaffirming this</text>
  <text start="656.56" dur="5.58">but again that people need to speak out</text>
  <text start="659.35" dur="6.06">and say absolutely not absolutely not</text>
  <text start="662.14" dur="5.34">this is an infringement of my rights my</text>
  <text start="665.41" dur="5.14">second Amendment rights just like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="667.48" dur="5.83">an infringement of my first my fourth my</text>

  <text start="918.28" dur="4.63">now we understand that the Ukraine is</text>

  <text start="931.7" dur="6.04">again behind these protests and these</text>
  <text start="934.85" dur="4.03">people are the central bankers in the US</text>

  <text start="1524.1" dur="5.64">have to see how this entire thing plays</text>
  <text start="1526.769" dur="6.301">out and also you have to remember in</text>
  <text start="1529.74" dur="5.7">February the Iranian delegation is</text>
  <text start="1533.07" dur="6.089">coming to New York to talk about the</text>

  <text start="1560.22" dur="6">blimp with a radar system and that can</text>
  <text start="1563.429" dur="7.281">you know that radar system is vast and</text>

  <text start="1582.63" dur="5.13">been preparing for quite a while and</text>
  <text start="1584.88" dur="6.81">this leads us to believe that something</text>
  <text start="1587.76" dur="6.09">potentially could happen now we</text>
  <text start="1591.69" dur="3.959">understand that tonight that Obama is</text>
  <text start="1593.85" dur="4.26">going to be giving his State of the</text>
  <text start="1595.649" dur="6.241">Union and he has many different points</text>

  <text start="1601.89" dur="5.55">talking points of the President and he</text>
  <text start="1604.79" dur="4.24">deciphered what they actually mean and</text>
  <text start="1607.44" dur="4.23">let me go through a couple of them here</text>
  <text start="1609.03" dur="5.04">the president says we significantly cut</text>
  <text start="1611.67" dur="4.02">the deficit in the last five years just</text>
  <text start="1614.07" dur="6.06">remember when you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1615.69" dur="6.84">watch this the u.s. deficit varies each</text>
  <text start="1620.13" dur="5.19">year but the federal debt continues to</text>
  <text start="1622.53" dur="6.21">balloon at record rates in 2013 it</text>
  <text start="1625.32" dur="6.87">surpassed 17 trillion dollars but Obama</text>
  <text start="1628.74" dur="5.85">will not discuss the debt tonight and he</text>
  <text start="1632.19" dur="5.01">Obama saying but there&amp;#39;s still a lot of</text>
  <text start="1634.59" dur="6.51">work to do we can&amp;#39;t cut our way out of</text>
  <text start="1637.2" dur="6">this hole what that means is it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="1641.1" dur="4.5">excuse for free spending bureaucrats</text>
  <text start="1643.2" dur="5.25">attacks at higher rates instead of</text>
  <text start="1645.6" dur="5.82">enacting real spending cuts Obama says</text>
  <text start="1648.45" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s only right that we ask everyone to</text>
  <text start="1651.42" dur="7.62">pay their fair share and attempt to use</text>
  <text start="1653.97" dur="7.47">emotion to justify higher taxes the</text>
  <text start="1659.04" dur="3.9">president says the Affordable Care Act</text>
  <text start="1661.44" dur="4.98">is working better than we expected</text>
  <text start="1662.94" dur="5.88">despite a few bumps along the way oh and</text>
  <text start="1666.42" dur="5.37">this is what it really means Obamacare</text>

  <text start="1678.21" dur="8.4">for obamacare on the federal exchange</text>
  <text start="1681.02" dur="8.23">Obama says income in income in equality</text>
  <text start="1686.61" dur="5.52">is defining challenge challenge of our</text>
  <text start="1689.25" dur="5.58">time what he really means is when you</text>
  <text start="1692.13" dur="6.42">hear this hold on to your wads we all</text>
  <text start="1694.83" dur="5.97">know what this means the president says</text>
