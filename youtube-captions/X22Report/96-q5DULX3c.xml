  <text start="94.07" dur="5.52">is out there telling the Fed listen you</text>
  <text start="97.159" dur="4.741">better start doing something because</text>
  <text start="99.59" dur="3.69">other countries are doing it you better</text>
  <text start="101.9" dur="4.469">start lowering the rates</text>
  <text start="103.28" dur="7.11">you better start stimulus because if</text>
  <text start="106.369" dur="7.411">this system falls apart it is your fault</text>
  <text start="110.39" dur="6.54">and he&amp;#39;s continually pushing this</text>
  <text start="113.78" dur="6.33">message out there Trump tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="116.93" dur="6.06">following with almost no inflation our</text>
  <text start="120.11" dur="5.1">country is needlessly being forced to</text>
  <text start="122.99" dur="4.68">pay a much higher interest rate than any</text>
  <text start="125.21" dur="4.97">other countries only because of very</text>
  <text start="127.67" dur="4.92">misguided Federal Reserve in addition</text>
  <text start="130.18" dur="4.089">quantitative tightening is continuing</text>
  <text start="132.59" dur="6.149">making it harder for our country to</text>
  <text start="134.269" dur="6.151">compete as good as we have done it could</text>
  <text start="138.739" dur="4.261">have been so much better</text>
  <text start="140.42" dur="4.95">interest rates cost should have been</text>
  <text start="143" dur="5.01">much lower and GDP in our country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="145.37" dur="5.1">wealth accumulation much higher such a</text>
  <text start="148.01" dur="4.44">waste of time and money also very unfair</text>
  <text start="150.47" dur="4.889">that other countries manipulate their</text>
  <text start="152.45" dur="6.24">currencies and pump money in Trump</text>
  <text start="155.359" dur="5.581">continued it is far more costly for the</text>
  <text start="158.69" dur="5.629">Federal Reserve to cut deeper if the</text>
  <text start="160.94" dur="7.609">economy actually does in the future turn</text>
  <text start="164.319" dur="6.81">very inexpensive in fact productive to</text>
  <text start="168.549" dur="4.83">move now the Fed raised and tightened</text>
  <text start="171.129" dur="6.33">far too much and too fast in other words</text>
  <text start="173.379" dur="8.491">they missed it big don&amp;#39;t miss it again</text>
  <text start="177.459" dur="6.92">and we know that the Federal Reserve the</text>
  <text start="181.87" dur="5.64">deep state working together they were</text>
  <text start="184.379" dur="5.56">raising the rates to have a completely</text>
  <text start="187.51" dur="5.399">different outcome what we&amp;#39;re watching</text>
  <text start="189.939" dur="5.491">right now is the show this is the phase</text>
  <text start="192.909" dur="4.621">where the Fed is thinking about it</text>
  <text start="195.43" dur="4.199">they&amp;#39;re analyzing they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="197.53" dur="4.14">figure out what to do and then we have</text>
  <text start="199.629" dur="3.69">Trump on the other side saying listen if</text>
  <text start="201.67" dur="3.929">you don&amp;#39;t do this the economy is going</text>
  <text start="203.319" dur="4.081">to fall apart and you are going to be</text>
  <text start="205.599" dur="5.461">blamed think about what he&amp;#39;s just done</text>
  <text start="207.4" dur="6.72">with he with these tweets he set the</text>
  <text start="211.06" dur="6.78">Federal Reserve completely up let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="214.12" dur="7.289">back in time just a little bit now when</text>
  <text start="217.84" dur="6.45">we look at when the Fed raised the rates</text>
  <text start="221.409" dur="6.601">and then drop the rates it seems like</text>
  <text start="224.29" dur="7.05">it&amp;#39;s always around a recession now</text>
  <text start="228.01" dur="6.03">remember we&amp;#39;ve had 47 recessions in the</text>
  <text start="231.34" dur="4.35">United States under the control of the</text>
  <text start="234.04" dur="5.789">Federal Reserve they&amp;#39;re doing a</text>
  <text start="235.69" dur="7.729">fantastic job just kidding now if we go</text>
  <text start="239.829" dur="7.74">back in time and we go back let&amp;#39;s say to</text>
  <text start="243.419" dur="7.121">2000 1999 around that time frame and we</text>
  <text start="247.569" dur="6.301">look at the graph you can see how the</text>
  <text start="250.54" dur="5.279">Fed continually raised rates and it went</text>
  <text start="253.87" dur="2.97">up and up and up and then the economy</text>
  <text start="255.819" dur="3.39">started to fall apart</text>
  <text start="256.84" dur="6.24">then it flatlined and then they dropped</text>
  <text start="259.209" dur="7.861">them very very quickly if you fast</text>
  <text start="263.08" dur="7.38">forward to 2006 yeah I mean actually</text>
  <text start="267.07" dur="8.19">before that 5 6 7 you can see the Fed</text>
  <text start="270.46" dur="7.139">raised the rates very very steeply they</text>
  <text start="275.26" dur="5.49">leveled off the economy started to fall</text>
  <text start="277.599" dur="8.671">apart they dropped their rates just as</text>
  <text start="280.75" dur="8.97">fast and if we move into 2720 in 2015</text>
  <text start="286.27" dur="5.73">2016 2017 you can see the Fed has been</text>
  <text start="289.72" dur="4.35">raising rates actually they really</text>
  <text start="292" dur="6.12">increased it when Trump came into office</text>
  <text start="294.07" dur="6.21">and now we&amp;#39;re at a flatline point</text>
  <text start="298.12" dur="4.2">Trump and the Patriots didn&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="300.28" dur="4.56">rates to go any higher because if they</text>
  <text start="302.32" dur="3.9">did everything would have started to</text>
  <text start="304.84" dur="4.17">fall apart I mean we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="306.22" dur="5.759">that now and we have been seeing it but</text>
  <text start="309.01" dur="5.37">believe me with this fake illusionary</text>
  <text start="311.979" dur="5.551">economy the whole thing would have come</text>
  <text start="314.38" dur="5.97">down in two seconds this is why Trump</text>
  <text start="317.53" dur="5.16">and the Patriots want the Fed to cut</text>
  <text start="320.35" dur="5.01">rates right now and they want them to</text>
  <text start="322.69" dur="4.44">stop the stimulus and it&amp;#39;s all for a</text>
  <text start="325.36" dur="4.29">specific reason remember this is all</text>
  <text start="327.13" dur="3.9">part of the plan now I just did an</text>
  <text start="329.65" dur="3.96">interview with Jim Willy</text>
  <text start="331.03" dur="6.03">it is on the x-22 report spotlight</text>
  <text start="333.61" dur="6.3">YouTube channel and it&amp;#39;s on bitch chute</text>
  <text start="337.06" dur="7.02">you can see it on the x-22 report and we</text>
  <text start="339.91" dur="7.5">talked about how gold will be the kill</text>
  <text start="344.08" dur="8.67">shot to bring down the central bank</text>
  <text start="347.41" dur="7.77">system and Jim Willie was explaining how</text>
  <text start="352.75" dur="6.81">the gold trade note was already being</text>
  <text start="355.18" dur="6.84">used in the world and eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="359.56" dur="5.16">going to happen is the United States is</text>
  <text start="362.02" dur="4.5">going to join up and start using this</text>
  <text start="364.72" dur="4.5">gold trade note because the rest of the</text>
  <text start="366.52" dur="4.769">world is using it and I do believe the</text>
  <text start="369.22" dur="5.6">world is going to be separating</text>
  <text start="371.289" dur="7.56">themselves from the central bank system</text>
  <text start="374.82" dur="6.279">this is why Trump is working so hard to</text>
  <text start="378.849" dur="4.651">get those individuals that believe in</text>
  <text start="381.099" dur="4.771">sound money that believe in the gold</text>
  <text start="383.5" dur="5.34">standard on the board of the Federal</text>
  <text start="385.87" dur="6.75">Reserve this is all part of the plan and</text>
  <text start="388.84" dur="6.23">it has to be done and the other thing</text>
  <text start="392.62" dur="5.43">that we discussed is how Trump is</text>
  <text start="395.07" dur="5.319">reworking the trade deals remember the</text>
  <text start="398.05" dur="5.46">countries around the world will no</text>
  <text start="400.389" dur="5.911">longer keep the US dollar in reserves</text>
  <text start="403.51" dur="6.81">which in the past they use that to buy</text>
  <text start="406.3" dur="6.119">our goods now the United States with</text>
  <text start="410.32" dur="6.24">other countries we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="412.419" dur="6.481">do trade because the petro dollar will</text>
  <text start="416.56" dur="6.329">no longer be the reserve currency of the</text>
  <text start="418.9" dur="6.75">world everything is about to change</text>
  <text start="422.889" dur="6.571">and this is why Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="425.65" dur="6.21">have been working so hard to change the</text>
  <text start="429.46" dur="7.56">trade deals bring back manufacturing</text>
  <text start="431.86" dur="6.51">factoring and rework everything here in</text>
  <text start="437.02" dur="2.25">the United States this is not a</text>
  <text start="438.37" dur="3.509">coincidence</text>
  <text start="439.27" dur="6.359">this is all being done on purpose</text>
  <text start="441.879" dur="7.081">according to a plan to eventually go</text>
  <text start="445.629" dur="4.831">after the central bank system and I</text>
  <text start="448.96" dur="2.79">believe that&amp;#39;s exactly where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="450.46" dur="4.59">headed now</text>
  <text start="451.75" dur="7.59">the Federal Reserve they are out there</text>
  <text start="455.05" dur="6.51">and they are saying yes we&amp;#39;ll be cutting</text>
  <text start="459.34" dur="4.829">the interest rates by maybe a quarter</text>
  <text start="461.56" dur="5.039">percentage later this month now we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="464.169" dur="5.581">have to see what happens I do believe</text>
  <text start="466.599" dur="4.951">that Powell is on board I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="469.75" dur="3.93">there&amp;#39;s other individuals within the Fed</text>
  <text start="471.55" dur="3.329">that want this to happen I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="473.68" dur="2.22">the mainstream media wants this to</text>
  <text start="474.879" dur="3">happen I don&amp;#39;t think the deep state</text>
  <text start="475.9" dur="4.5">wants this to happen but I do believe</text>
  <text start="477.879" dur="6.181">that the Patriots are in complete</text>
  <text start="480.4" dur="9.66">control of all of this and I do believe</text>
  <text start="484.06" dur="9.18">that the Fed will cut the rates we will</text>
  <text start="490.06" dur="7.889">see the economy statistically take off</text>
  <text start="493.24" dur="7.349">and this is what Trump needs going into</text>
  <text start="497.949" dur="4.65">the election he knows it those people</text>
  <text start="500.589" dur="4.44">behind him know it and everyone</text>
  <text start="502.599" dur="6.06">listening here knows it remember this is</text>
  <text start="505.029" dur="6.39">just not a a one-off plan this is a plan</text>
  <text start="508.659" dur="5.82">that takes quite a bit of time a lot of</text>
  <text start="511.419" dur="6.06">planning to get all the pieces in place</text>
  <text start="514.479" dur="6.18">and they&amp;#39;ve been doing this from the</text>
  <text start="517.479" dur="5.97">very beginning removing those blocks</text>
  <text start="520.659" dur="5.281">setting everything up getting those</text>
  <text start="523.449" dur="3.031">individuals into position it&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="525.94" dur="3.329">thing</text>
  <text start="526.48" dur="5.76">with the central bank they&amp;#39;re removing</text>
  <text start="529.269" dur="6.51">certain individuals getting people onto</text>
  <text start="532.24" dur="6.599">the board getting ready for a</text>
  <text start="535.779" dur="4.951">restructure getting ready to uh shirin</text>
  <text start="538.839" dur="5.19">sound money that&amp;#39;s what this is all</text>
  <text start="540.73" dur="5.19">about this is not about a simple oh</text>
  <text start="544.029" dur="5.12">let&amp;#39;s arrest this person that person and</text>
  <text start="545.92" dur="7.77">we&amp;#39;re done with this is about resetting</text>
  <text start="549.149" dur="7.361">the entire system and what I mean by</text>
  <text start="553.69" dur="5.7">that it&amp;#39;s not just resetting those</text>
  <text start="556.51" dur="6.75">people in government it&amp;#39;s resetting all</text>
  <text start="559.39" dur="6.43">of it it has to be done this is not</text>
  <text start="563.26" dur="6.79">about a four-year election</text>
  <text start="565.82" dur="8.36">this is about giving the country back to</text>
  <text start="570.05" dur="7.76">the people and the people controlling</text>
  <text start="574.18" dur="6.34">where the country goes from here our</text>
  <text start="577.81" dur="5.11">founding fathers have told us that</text>
  <text start="580.52" dur="5.55">eventually we&amp;#39;re going to have to fight</text>
  <text start="582.92" dur="7.2">for this once again and here we are this</text>
  <text start="586.07" dur="6.42">is exactly what we are doing and Trump</text>
  <text start="590.12" dur="5.4">and the Patriots during this period of</text>
  <text start="592.49" dur="6.96">time they&amp;#39;ve been planning out a whole</text>
  <text start="595.52" dur="8.04">new economic system which will be backed</text>
  <text start="599.45" dur="6.42">by sound money I mean if you go back in</text>
  <text start="603.56" dur="5.52">time and you go back to the 70s did the</text>
  <text start="605.87" dur="5.7">central bankers do they were planning a</text>
  <text start="609.08" dur="4.98">whole new system to take us off the gold</text>
  <text start="611.57" dur="4.8">standard Trump and the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="614.06" dur="6.47">reversing this here we are in the year</text>
  <text start="616.37" dur="7.11">2019 going into 2020 and they are</text>
  <text start="620.53" dur="7.39">creating a new system to take us off</text>
  <text start="623.48" dur="6.93">Fiat and bring us back to gold and to</text>
  <text start="627.92" dur="5.88">get rid of the central bank this is what</text>
  <text start="630.41" dur="7.41">this whole plan is about because the</text>
  <text start="633.8" dur="8.7">central bank is the source of everything</text>
  <text start="637.82" dur="8.69">that we see today the central bank</text>
  <text start="642.5" dur="7.89">creates corruption the central bank</text>
  <text start="646.51" dur="7.93">places controls in place the central</text>
  <text start="650.39" dur="6.48">bank allows a reserve currency which is</text>
  <text start="654.44" dur="4.8">controlled by a nation to create a deep</text>
  <text start="656.87" dur="4.74">state which allows them then to control</text>
  <text start="659.24" dur="4.85">other countries in the meantime the</text>
  <text start="661.61" dur="6.36">central bank sits on top of all of this</text>
  <text start="664.09" dur="8.38">once this is removed checks and balances</text>
  <text start="667.97" dur="7.98">are re-established the government just</text>
  <text start="672.47" dur="7.53">can&amp;#39;t borrow willy-nilly they have to</text>
  <text start="675.95" dur="9.06">explain why they need these funds see if</text>
  <text start="680" dur="7.11">the funds actually exists you just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="685.01" dur="3.81">go to a bank like the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="687.11" dur="3.87">and say hey listen we need another</text>
  <text start="688.82" dur="4.41">trillion how are we gonna pay it back we</text>
  <text start="690.98" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t know tax receipts are falling we</text>
  <text start="693.23" dur="3.2">can&amp;#39;t be bothered with that you know</text>
  <text start="694.34" dur="5.48">what we&amp;#39;ll do we&amp;#39;ll just borrow more</text>
  <text start="696.43" dur="6.48">and let the debt rise it doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="699.82" dur="5.91">the system eventually comes down I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="702.91" dur="6.119">care what anybody says this is no</text>
  <text start="705.73" dur="5.549">different than anything else when you</text>
  <text start="709.029" dur="5.191">have too much debt you don&amp;#39;t have enough</text>
  <text start="711.279" dur="5.881">money coming in to pay the debt to pay</text>
  <text start="714.22" dur="6.809">the interest the system falls apart</text>
  <text start="717.16" dur="6.36">period they just can&amp;#39;t create currency</text>
  <text start="721.029" dur="5.421">and continually create currency there is</text>
  <text start="723.52" dur="5.61">a breaking point it always happens</text>
  <text start="726.45" dur="5.29">throughout history it has happens it</text>
