  <text start="106.259" dur="7.051">declined we know this this is a fact</text>
  <text start="109.909" dur="6.611">there&amp;#39;s no way to argue this because we</text>
  <text start="113.31" dur="6.12">can see it we&amp;#39;ve been tracking it and we</text>
  <text start="116.52" dur="7.05">see that everything is contracting right</text>
  <text start="119.43" dur="7.37">now and I mean everything even the</text>
  <text start="123.57" dur="6.81">manipulated numbers are contracting and</text>
  <text start="126.8" dur="7.77">we can see at this point the US</text>
  <text start="130.38" dur="9.21">government central bankers they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="134.57" dur="7.75">crisis mode they&amp;#39;re planning for this</text>
  <text start="139.59" dur="6.11">collapse they&amp;#39;re getting ready for this</text>
  <text start="142.32" dur="7.83">collapse they know it&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="145.7" dur="7.03">they know they want to control it and we</text>
  <text start="150.15" dur="6.71">can see right now that as more and more</text>
  <text start="152.73" dur="6.36">of these economic indicators hit the fan</text>
  <text start="156.86" dur="4.72">they&amp;#39;re getting more and more worried</text>
  <text start="159.09" dur="5.76">and this is why the central bank is</text>
  <text start="161.58" dur="5.219">pushing for more legislation to get more</text>
  <text start="164.85" dur="3.96">power and you&amp;#39;re going to see the</text>
  <text start="166.799" dur="4.621">central bank continually put out</text>
  <text start="168.81" dur="6.24">articles have meetings talking about we</text>
  <text start="171.42" dur="5.49">need more ammo we need legislation we</text>
  <text start="175.05" dur="3.659">need Congress to give us more power</text>
  <text start="176.91" dur="2.8">because this is what they ultimately</text>
  <text start="178.709" dur="5.131">want</text>
  <text start="179.71" dur="6.45">they want complete power of this system</text>
  <text start="183.84" dur="4.96">but when we look at the economic</text>
  <text start="186.16" dur="4.86">indicators things are deteriorating very</text>
  <text start="188.8" dur="4.59">very quickly we know that auto sales</text>
  <text start="191.02" dur="6.33">well they&amp;#39;ve reached a plateau Ford</text>
  <text start="193.39" dur="6.84">amidst to it they know that auto sales</text>
  <text start="197.35" dur="6">are going nowhere right now and what</text>
  <text start="200.23" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re seeing is a surge in delinquent</text>
  <text start="203.35" dur="3.9">subprime auto borrowers I mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="205.3" dur="4.77">hitting a seven-year high right now and</text>
  <text start="207.25" dur="7.56">of course all the automobile companies</text>
  <text start="210.07" dur="7.11">they&amp;#39;re handing out incentives trying to</text>
  <text start="214.81" dur="4.26">get people in there to purchase the cars</text>
  <text start="217.18" dur="5.22">and we saw this prior to two thousand</text>
  <text start="219.07" dur="6.71">eight which put these companies into</text>
  <text start="222.4" dur="8.22">bankruptcy and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="225.78" dur="8.2">August was a disaster and September with</text>
  <text start="230.62" dur="7.41">all these incentives it did not help the</text>
  <text start="233.98" dur="6.96">auto industry we see Ford is shutting</text>
  <text start="238.03" dur="6.3">down some plants in Louisville Kentucky</text>
  <text start="240.94" dur="7.32">a factory building that builds the</text>
  <text start="244.33" dur="7.26">escape they lincoln MKC MKC the sport</text>
  <text start="248.26" dur="5.97">utility vehicle well they&amp;#39;re closing it</text>
  <text start="251.59" dur="5.3">down they&amp;#39;re closing plants in Mexico</text>
  <text start="254.23" dur="6">that make the fusion sedan the Fiesta</text>
  <text start="256.89" dur="6.22">the second largest US automaker will</text>
  <text start="260.23" dur="7.65">close the f-150 factory near Kansas City</text>
  <text start="263.11" dur="6.75">for seven days worst of all while the</text>
  <text start="267.88" dur="5.21">rest of the US manufacturing sector has</text>
  <text start="269.86" dur="6.72">been in a decline the auto industry was</text>
  <text start="273.09" dur="6.97">really like the only shining light for</text>
  <text start="276.58" dur="7.65">us manufacturing and now that light is</text>
  <text start="280.06" dur="8.04">going out so this is going to have a</text>
  <text start="284.23" dur="6.71">huge impact on the economy once again</text>
  <text start="288.1" dur="7.35">and it&amp;#39;s going to have a huge impact on</text>
  <text start="290.94" dur="7.63">how the economy is really doing and we</text>
  <text start="295.45" dur="7.77">see more and more companies the sales</text>
  <text start="298.57" dur="7.71">the revenue they&amp;#39;re not hitting what</text>
  <text start="303.22" dur="7.35">they used to hit like back in the good</text>
  <text start="306.28" dur="6.48">old days we see IBM right now after 17</text>
  <text start="310.57" dur="3.15">consecutive quarters more than four</text>
  <text start="312.76" dur="3.95">years</text>
  <text start="313.72" dur="6.5">of declining annual revenue growth IBM</text>
  <text start="316.71" dur="8.29">reported the third-quarter revenues at</text>
  <text start="320.22" dur="9.12">nineteen point two two billion well they</text>
  <text start="325" dur="7.53">beat their consensus of nineteen billion</text>
  <text start="329.34" dur="6.4">but it&amp;#39;s still point three percent lower</text>
  <text start="332.53" dur="5.84">than a year ago so this is the 18th</text>
  <text start="335.74" dur="6.02">consecutive quarter of declining</text>
  <text start="338.37" dur="9.79">revenues now during the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="341.76" dur="11.35">guess what they had three actually four</text>
  <text start="348.16" dur="7.17">I&amp;#39;m sorry if I&amp;#39;ve four and now we&amp;#39;re way</text>
  <text start="353.11" dur="4.71">past that and of course you know what</text>
  <text start="355.33" dur="6.36">the companies do at this point they lay</text>
  <text start="357.82" dur="5.7">off individuals they cut costs and then</text>
  <text start="361.69" dur="4.68">they say oh the company&amp;#39;s profitable</text>
  <text start="363.52" dur="4.79">once again but when you look back to way</text>
  <text start="366.37" dur="4.98">the company was and what it is today</text>
  <text start="368.31" dur="5.77">it&amp;#39;s completely different maybe half the</text>
  <text start="371.35" dur="4.89">size they have half the buildings they</text>
  <text start="374.08" dur="5.19">have half the manufacturing they have</text>
  <text start="376.24" dur="5.55">half of everything we see it in retail</text>
  <text start="379.27" dur="4.31">that happens all the time I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="381.79" dur="4.2">if many people remember circuit city</text>
  <text start="383.58" dur="3.52">they hit stores all over the place and</text>
  <text start="385.99" dur="2.85">they said oh no there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong</text>
  <text start="387.1" dur="4.29">with circuit city we&amp;#39;re just closing a</text>
  <text start="388.84" dur="5.46">couple stores here and there and as they</text>
  <text start="391.39" dur="4.5">continually closed stores well they</text>
  <text start="394.3" dur="3.81">couldn&amp;#39;t generate the sales even though</text>
  <text start="395.89" dur="4.5">they laid off a lot of people they cut</text>
  <text start="398.11" dur="4.74">expenses eventually what happens is they</text>
  <text start="400.39" dur="4.5">go out of business and as the economy</text>
  <text start="402.85" dur="5.93">continually declines this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="404.89" dur="7.29">happening to all these corporations they</text>
  <text start="408.78" dur="5.32">cannot continue on now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="412.18" dur="4.47">looking at total industrial production</text>
  <text start="414.1" dur="4.71">in the US and we know it has fallen to</text>
  <text start="416.65" dur="5.31">one percent in September compared to</text>
  <text start="418.81" dur="8.28">September of 2015 where it was much</text>
  <text start="421.96" dur="7.5">higher and we see right now is that this</text>
  <text start="427.09" dur="5.91">is the first time industrial production</text>
  <text start="429.46" dur="5.94">index has reached this level and the</text>
  <text start="433" dur="6.57">last time we saw it at this level was</text>
  <text start="435.4" dur="5.76">back in March of 2007 so when we look at</text>
  <text start="439.57" dur="3.21">this we see business equipment</text>
  <text start="441.16" dur="4.319">production fell by one-point-four</text>
  <text start="442.78" dur="3.93">percent we see electronics is down by</text>
  <text start="445.479" dur="2.49">negative five point eight percent</text>
  <text start="446.71" dur="4.169">clothing down-</text>
  <text start="447.969" dur="6.48">two percent paper products down by</text>
  <text start="450.879" dur="6.21">negative four point three percent and it</text>
  <text start="454.449" dur="5.63">goes on and on and on and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="457.089" dur="7.32">seeing is a complete breakdown of</text>
  <text start="460.079" dur="6.4">industrial production and when we look</text>
  <text start="464.409" dur="5.91">at industrial production is a great</text>
  <text start="466.479" dur="6.9">indicator to show us when the recession</text>
  <text start="470.319" dur="8.76">is going to hit and when we look back</text>
  <text start="473.379" dur="7.74">going back to the 1950s we see that the</text>
  <text start="479.079" dur="4.38">recession hit every time industrial</text>
  <text start="481.119" dur="5.28">production declined the last time a</text>
  <text start="483.459" dur="7.41">declined was guess what in 2007 going</text>
  <text start="486.399" dur="8.22">into 2008 prior that was 2000 2000 going</text>
  <text start="490.869" dur="7.77">to 2001 and it&amp;#39;s consistent throughout</text>
  <text start="494.619" dur="9.75">time and we&amp;#39;re in the same exact pattern</text>
  <text start="498.639" dur="11.25">as we were back in 2007 going into 2008</text>
  <text start="504.369" dur="9.54">and what this shows us is we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="509.889" dur="10.71">recession right now that&amp;#39;s what this</text>
  <text start="513.909" dur="10.771">means we are in a recession we are</text>
  <text start="520.599" dur="7.381">heading towards a collapse of the entire</text>
  <text start="524.68" dur="5.879">system now the government is not going</text>
  <text start="527.98" dur="5.459">to come out and say we&amp;#39;re in a recession</text>
  <text start="530.559" dur="6.181">they don&amp;#39;t do this the central bank does</text>
  <text start="533.439" dur="7.471">not do this they wait until months and</text>
  <text start="536.74" dur="7.139">months later to even recognize that we</text>
  <text start="540.91" dur="4.469">were in a recession but from all the</text>
  <text start="543.879" dur="4.31">economic indicators and from everything</text>
  <text start="545.379" dur="6.721">that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at they are</text>
  <text start="548.189" dur="9.221">showing us we are in a recession right</text>
  <text start="552.1" dur="7.44">now and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that this</text>
  <text start="557.41" dur="5.909">is going to continue because once it</text>
  <text start="559.54" dur="8.549">starts to drop the drop accelerates like</text>
  <text start="563.319" dur="7.591">everything else and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="568.089" dur="5.73">right now is the government the central</text>
  <text start="570.91" dur="5.519">banks they&amp;#39;re scrambling because they</text>
  <text start="573.819" dur="4.86">know that this economy yes they can even</text>
  <text start="576.429" dur="4.981">manipulate the rest of the numbers stock</text>
  <text start="578.679" dur="5.28">market GDP unemployment</text>
  <text start="581.41" dur="4.109">but when everything else dies there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="583.959" dur="5.041">nothing left for them to do this is why</text>
  <text start="585.519" dur="6.211">the central bank wants more power they</text>
  <text start="589" dur="5.1">want more control of the economy but</text>
  <text start="591.73" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;ll never be able to control the</text>
  <text start="594.1" dur="5.82">people aspect of the economy and this</text>
  <text start="597.37" dur="4.409">will always be their downfall no matter</text>
  <text start="599.92" dur="4.769">what I know many people say oh they can</text>
  <text start="601.779" dur="4.98">just keep creating currency they can</text>
  <text start="604.689" dur="3.931">keep manipulating the numbers but when</text>
  <text start="606.759" dur="3.421">everyone is just sitting around there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="608.62" dur="5.25">no industrial production there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="610.18" dur="6.36">manufacturing there&amp;#39;s no retail sales</text>
  <text start="613.87" dur="3.899">more and more stores are closing more</text>
  <text start="616.54" dur="3.659">and more people being laid off because</text>
  <text start="617.769" dur="6.451">companies are cutting expenses guess</text>
  <text start="620.199" dur="6.361">what there will come a time where the</text>
  <text start="624.22" dur="4.02">economy will not be able to function I</text>
  <text start="626.56" dur="3.99">don&amp;#39;t care how much currency they print</text>
  <text start="628.24" dur="5.699">I don&amp;#39;t care how much manipulation there</text>
  <text start="630.55" dur="8.13">is it will not be able to function</text>
  <text start="633.939" dur="9.45">correctly and the free market the real</text>
  <text start="638.68" dur="6.389">economy it will break through and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="643.389" dur="6.87">when the whole thing will start falling</text>
  <text start="645.069" dur="6.721">apart now we talk a lot about how the</text>
  <text start="650.259" dur="4.651">bank&amp;#39;s the central banks are</text>
