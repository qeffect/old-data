  <text start="146.83" dur="4.11">of what these peoples done in the past</text>
  <text start="148.03" dur="4.289">the economy is now coming down now when</text>
  <text start="150.94" dur="3.93">I say everything can happen at once</text>
  <text start="152.319" dur="6.601">we&amp;#39;re gonna see news and the economy all</text>
  <text start="154.87" dur="6.27">come down at the same time we see the</text>
  <text start="158.92" dur="6.81">central bankers they&amp;#39;re still pushing</text>
  <text start="161.14" dur="6.3">the idea that people have funds that</text>
  <text start="165.73" dur="5.25">they can tap now remember the central</text>
  <text start="167.44" dur="5.73">banks they run on debt their business is</text>
  <text start="170.98" dur="5.31">debt the more debt there is the better</text>
  <text start="173.17" dur="5.22">they do if people aren&amp;#39;t in debt they</text>
  <text start="176.29" dur="4.89">don&amp;#39;t like this they need more debt and</text>
  <text start="178.39" dur="4.53">if there&amp;#39;s equity in homes and remember</text>
  <text start="181.18" dur="3.93">they pump the bubbles up quite a bit</text>
  <text start="182.92" dur="3.66">they want you to take that out and go</text>
  <text start="185.11" dur="3.12">spend it because what happens</text>
  <text start="186.58" dur="4.14">well if you take an equity line of</text>
  <text start="188.23" dur="5.58">credit or your refinance and you to pull</text>
  <text start="190.72" dur="5.67">that money out you&amp;#39;re in more debt this</text>
  <text start="193.81" dur="5.07">is what they like and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="196.39" dur="6.92">that since the real estate market has</text>
  <text start="198.88" dur="7.05">gone up it&amp;#39;s time to tap that debt and</text>
  <text start="203.31" dur="4.15">most of the Americans out there today</text>
  <text start="205.93" dur="3.86">are very leery about this and we can see</text>
  <text start="207.46" dur="4.56">refinance applications they&amp;#39;re declining</text>
  <text start="209.79" dur="3.94">because interest rates are moving up and</text>
  <text start="212.02" dur="4.86">they don&amp;#39;t want to touch it they</text>
  <text start="213.73" dur="5.97">remember what happened back in 2008 and</text>
  <text start="216.88" dur="5.51">it looks like many people don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="219.7" dur="5.85">get caught in that same type of scenario</text>
  <text start="222.39" dur="7.69">but we know the real estate market has</text>
  <text start="225.55" dur="6.96">reached that point where people are</text>
  <text start="230.08" dur="4.26">selling because they realize the markets</text>
  <text start="232.51" dur="5.19">going to be coming down what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="234.34" dur="6.06">interesting is minuchin who is the</text>
  <text start="237.7" dur="4.26">treasury secretary he decided to sell</text>
  <text start="240.4" dur="4.53">his thirty three million dollar</text>
  <text start="241.96" dur="7.02">apartment which is on Park Avenue</text>
  <text start="244.93" dur="7.92">now his apartment right now is three</text>
  <text start="248.98" dur="6.27">times of what he paid for it and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="252.85" dur="5.009">putting it up for sale and you have to</text>
  <text start="255.25" dur="5.7">think yourself why is he doing this why</text>
  <text start="257.859" dur="5.851">now why choose now because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="260.95" dur="6.36">starting to see housing prices drop in</text>
  <text start="263.71" dur="6.56">many areas if we look at different areas</text>
  <text start="267.31" dur="6.09">around the country we can see that</text>
  <text start="270.27" dur="6.1">prices are starting to come down this</text>
  <text start="273.4" dur="4.38">tells me that he understands that the</text>
  <text start="276.37" dur="4.68">real estate market is gonna be coming</text>
  <text start="277.78" dur="7.11">down and he needs to unload this now and</text>
  <text start="281.05" dur="6.66">cash in and many individuals the wealthy</text>
  <text start="284.89" dur="4.44">they realize this this is not just with</text>
  <text start="287.71" dur="4.95">real estate but with the stock market</text>
  <text start="289.33" dur="5.88">any other type of investments once they</text>
  <text start="292.66" dur="5.43">know they&amp;#39;re very close to the top they</text>
  <text start="295.21" dur="4.74">know that this is the time and we can</text>
  <text start="298.09" dur="4.74">see at this point this is what is</text>
  <text start="299.95" dur="4.83">happening right now the big players are</text>
  <text start="302.83" dur="5.37">getting out because they know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="304.78" dur="5.82">coming they need to offload this because</text>
  <text start="308.2" dur="5.55">once the real estate market drops he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="310.6" dur="5.34">not gonna be making three times on his</text>
  <text start="313.75" dur="4.35">apartment when the market drops he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="315.94" dur="4.349">gonna lose money when the market drops</text>
  <text start="318.1" dur="5.489">and this is why he wants to get out</text>
  <text start="320.289" dur="6.06">now we see many different financial</text>
  <text start="323.589" dur="5.13">pundits they&amp;#39;re all pointing to the same</text>
  <text start="326.349" dur="3.74">thing when the Fed is raising their</text>
  <text start="328.719" dur="3.48">rates and they&amp;#39;re all giving different</text>
  <text start="330.089" dur="4.091">examples of when they think it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="332.199" dur="4.11">to come down and everyone most of them</text>
  <text start="334.18" dur="5.219">are is around 3% some are 2.7 percent</text>
  <text start="336.309" dur="5.401">2.8 percent when the interest rates hit</text>
  <text start="339.399" dur="3.841">that area they&amp;#39;re saying things are</text>
  <text start="341.71" dur="1.979">gonna fall apart like we&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="343.24" dur="3.149">before</text>
  <text start="343.689" dur="4.861">we see barry Bannister became the latest</text>
  <text start="346.389" dur="4.02">to issue a timeline on how many more</text>
  <text start="348.55" dur="3.63">rate hikes the Fed can push through</text>
  <text start="350.409" dur="4.32">before the market is finally impacted</text>
  <text start="352.18" dur="4.829">now according to his calculations just</text>
  <text start="354.729" dur="4.47">two more rate hikes will put the central</text>
  <text start="357.009" dur="4.5">bank above the neutral rate the interest</text>
  <text start="359.199" dur="5.19">rate that neither stimulates nor holds</text>
  <text start="361.509" dur="4.62">back the economy the feds long-term</text>
  <text start="364.389" dur="5.34">projection of his policy rate has risen</text>
  <text start="366.129" dur="7.46">from 2.8 at the end of 2017 to 2.9 in</text>
  <text start="369.729" dur="6.66">June and we can see that many other</text>
  <text start="373.589" dur="4.69">financial banks and pundits are saying</text>
  <text start="376.389" dur="3.93">the same thing Deutsche Bank Bank of</text>
  <text start="378.279" dur="4.68">America they&amp;#39;re all looking at this</text>
  <text start="380.319" dur="5.4">looking back in time looking at history</text>
  <text start="382.959" dur="4.92">and saying that yes there is a certain</text>
  <text start="385.719" dur="4.68">point in time when the interest rates</text>
  <text start="387.879" dur="4.41">move up and the economy completely falls</text>
  <text start="390.399" dur="5.61">apart and everything comes crashing down</text>
  <text start="392.289" dur="5.821">and we can see this is exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="396.009" dur="6.601">happening we&amp;#39;re going to reach that</text>
  <text start="398.11" dur="6.599">point and a lot of these financial</text>
  <text start="402.61" dur="4.279">institutions the financial plans are</text>
  <text start="404.709" dur="6.45">saying that this is going to happen in</text>
  <text start="406.889" dur="6.34">2019 and most likely we will be in a</text>
  <text start="411.159" dur="4.201">recession and the whole system will</text>
  <text start="413.229" dur="4.261">start to fall apart now remember the</text>
  <text start="415.36" dur="5.339">news is going to be coming out very very</text>
  <text start="417.49" dur="5.459">soon and when I talk about the news I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="420.699" dur="4.95">talking about what they found with FISA</text>
  <text start="422.949" dur="4.26">and things like that the first part of</text>
  <text start="425.649" dur="2.79">the phase is going to get the public</text>
  <text start="427.209" dur="2.91">used to all of this so they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="428.439" dur="4.68">drop it a little bit at a time and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="430.119" dur="5.461">go into this in the next report and q</text>
  <text start="433.119" dur="4.29">actually confirms that they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="435.58" dur="4.079">to drop everything at once they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="437.409" dur="6.9">be dropping this in stages to get the</text>
  <text start="439.659" dur="7.53">public used to the idea of government</text>
  <text start="444.309" dur="5.64">being corrupt because remember a lot of</text>
  <text start="447.189" dur="5.22">people think the government people like</text>
  <text start="449.949" dur="3.011">Obama Clinton and the rest they were not</text>
  <text start="452.409" dur="2.621">corrupt</text>
  <text start="452.96" dur="3">many people you know who are looking at</text>
  <text start="455.03" dur="4.29">it from a different angle</text>
  <text start="455.96" dur="6.66">believe they are but they&amp;#39;re not used to</text>
  <text start="459.32" dur="5.58">the idea of this and once this news</text>
  <text start="462.62" dur="4.38">comes out and remember they&amp;#39;re everyday</text>
  <text start="464.9" dur="6.18">Americans like you and me they have</text>
  <text start="467" dur="7.59">investments they own a house they invest</text>
  <text start="471.08" dur="5.58">in the market maybe and what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="474.59" dur="3.99">happen is people gonna get nervous</text>
  <text start="476.66" dur="3.569">they&amp;#39;re gonna realize what is happening</text>
  <text start="478.58" dur="3.809">here they might reject it in the</text>
  <text start="480.229" dur="4.711">beginning and nothing might happen but</text>
  <text start="482.389" dur="4.471">as time goes on and more and more of</text>
  <text start="484.94" dur="4.53">this comes out people are gonna start to</text>
  <text start="486.86" dur="4.02">realize what is going on here people are</text>
  <text start="489.47" dur="3.72">gonna look for the truth they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="490.88" dur="4.77">research the truth and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="493.19" dur="4.229">start to say hmm okay now I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="495.65" dur="3.96">researching this and I&amp;#39;m also</text>
  <text start="497.419" dur="3.81">researching the economy and I&amp;#39;m starting</text>
  <text start="499.61" dur="4.529">to believe that the economy is a lie</text>
  <text start="501.229" dur="5.491">also because again one thing leads into</text>
  <text start="504.139" dur="9.061">another and once more and more people</text>
  <text start="506.72" dur="8.58">here and research and become a woken to</text>
  <text start="513.2" dur="4.74">all of this they&amp;#39;re gonna start to</text>
  <text start="515.3" dur="3.989">realize something is wrong here and this</text>
  <text start="517.94" dur="4.31">is when people are going to get a little</text>
  <text start="519.289" dur="5.851">nervous they&amp;#39;re gonna be pissed off and</text>
  <text start="522.25" dur="4.51">they might even start doing stuff with</text>
  <text start="525.14" dur="4.41">their investments because they realize</text>
  <text start="526.76" dur="5.01">what&amp;#39;s going on here and I think this is</text>
  <text start="529.55" dur="4.92">why it&amp;#39;s gonna be done in stages to get</text>
  <text start="531.77" dur="5.46">people used to the idea and most likely</text>
  <text start="534.47" dur="5.07">we know that the central bank and the</text>
  <text start="537.23" dur="3.63">deep state and the rest we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="539.54" dur="3.81">preparing something else on the other</text>
  <text start="540.86" dur="5.25">side but when this news does come out</text>

  <text start="550.339" dur="6.931">and we&amp;#39;re going to see things really</text>
  <text start="554.39" dur="5.79">start to accelerate remember what</text>
  <text start="557.27" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;ve done was they built this economy</text>
  <text start="560.18" dur="4.68">on a gigantic illusion they built it on</text>
  <text start="563.15" dur="4.08">statistical numbers where they can</text>
