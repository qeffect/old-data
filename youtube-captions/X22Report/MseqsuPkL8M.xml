  <text start="42.92" dur="4.169">around four hundred and sixty nine</text>
  <text start="44.21" dur="5.489">points and every day it&amp;#39;s been going</text>
  <text start="47.089" dur="4.591">down down down and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="49.699" dur="5.28">seeing right now and a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="51.68" dur="5.729">saying that the Japanese have lost</text>
  <text start="54.979" dur="5.701">control their bond market and they have</text>
  <text start="57.409" dur="7.32">lost control and this is a first domino</text>
  <text start="60.68" dur="5.34">to fall and we are starting to see some</text>
  <text start="64.729" dur="4.381">of this we&amp;#39;re going to have to see what</text>
  <text start="66.02" dur="6.18">happens on Tuesday when the market open</text>
  <text start="69.11" dur="8.1">because if you notice Europe is down the</text>

  <text start="77.21" dur="4.95">the Asian markets are down especially</text>
  <text start="78.41" dur="6.78">the Nikkei and when Tuesday comes we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="82.16" dur="5.46">see what they will do here normally what</text>
  <text start="85.19" dur="4.26">they do is they just have the plunge</text>
  <text start="87.62" dur="4.8">protection team high frequency traders</text>
  <text start="89.45" dur="4.95">and it starts out negative and they pump</text>
  <text start="92.42" dur="5.28">it up pump it up pump it up until they</text>
  <text start="94.4" dur="9.54">get into the positive area but a lot of</text>
  <text start="97.7" dur="9.81">news agencies are calling for a downward</text>
  <text start="103.94" dur="5.58">movement in the market Jack Bogle has</text>
  <text start="107.51" dur="4.469">warned us of a twenty-five to fifty</text>
  <text start="109.52" dur="11.279">percent downward move and he says it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="111.979" dur="12">almost certain and in Japan they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="120.799" dur="5.61">looking I mean our society general is</text>
  <text start="123.979" dur="4.791">warning stark stocks to crash and gold</text>
  <text start="126.409" dur="5.601">to top ten thousand</text>
  <text start="128.77" dur="7.41">and basically what they&amp;#39;re saying here</text>
  <text start="132.01" dur="5.76">is that gold will top 10,000 per ounce</text>
  <text start="136.18" dur="4.4">the stock market will tank and</text>
  <text start="137.77" dur="6">Treasuries will yield less than 1% and</text>
  <text start="140.58" dur="5.71">this is from societe Generale&amp;#39;s Albert</text>
  <text start="143.77" dur="5.34">Edwards forecast in a trade mark bearish</text>
  <text start="146.29" dur="5.07">report on Thursday so a lot of people</text>
  <text start="149.11" dur="4.89">are looking at this and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="151.36" dur="7.5">are telling us that it looks like</text>
  <text start="154" dur="7.29">something bad is definitely coming but</text>
  <text start="158.86" dur="4.71">what I think is going to happen I mean I</text>
  <text start="161.29" dur="3.81">again I&amp;#39;m looking at this and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="163.57" dur="3.99">looking at the past and I&amp;#39;m looking at</text>
  <text start="165.1" dur="4.23">what central banks and governments</text>
  <text start="167.56" dur="4.44">normally do and I know we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="169.33" dur="5.49">expecting this huge huge crash and this</text>
  <text start="172" dur="8.01">collapse and but I think what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="174.82" dur="7.65">going to do is they were going to put</text>
  <text start="180.01" dur="4.26">this off and i don&amp;#39;t mean by i don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="182.47" dur="4.47">mean kick the can down the road where</text>
  <text start="184.27" dur="5.97">nothing happens i do believe that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="186.94" dur="6.51">going to see a a market crash but i</text>
  <text start="190.24" dur="5.31">think it&amp;#39;s going to crash not the way</text>
  <text start="193.45" dur="4.11">everyone thinks it&amp;#39;s going to happen i</text>
  <text start="195.55" dur="4.92">think what&amp;#39;s going to happen is the</text>
  <text start="197.56" dur="5.67">market will go way down just like we saw</text>
  <text start="200.47" dur="6.12">in 2008 the market dropped you know one</text>
  <text start="203.23" dur="5.82">from 1400 to 1100 and i think the same</text>
  <text start="206.59" dur="4.17">thing is going to happen and i think</text>
  <text start="209.05" dur="6.75">that we&amp;#39;re going to see a drop from like</text>
  <text start="210.76" dur="9.6">15 or 16 whatever we reach down to about</text>
  <text start="215.8" dur="6.74">13 or so 12 maybe and that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="220.36" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re going to start the balance</text>
  <text start="222.54" dur="4.48">because they&amp;#39;re going to say a lot of</text>
  <text start="224.68" dur="4.29">the bank&amp;#39;s they need support we need to</text>
  <text start="227.02" dur="4.98">do something and you&amp;#39;re going to start</text>
  <text start="228.97" dur="5.97">seeing them start to argue about this</text>
  <text start="232" dur="4.95">and I believe that they do everything</text>
  <text start="234.94" dur="3.6">incremental e they don&amp;#39;t want to do this</text>
  <text start="236.95" dur="4.71">all at once they know the collapse is</text>
  <text start="238.54" dur="5.16">comming that that is for sure a definite</text>
  <text start="241.66" dur="3.63">but I think they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="243.7" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re going to try to do this in</text>
  <text start="245.29" dur="5.22">stages where we go down bounce a little</text>
  <text start="248.41" dur="4.35">bit boom down again bounce it a little</text>
  <text start="250.51" dur="5.49">bit down a little bit and give everyone</text>
  <text start="252.76" dur="5.509">and it will hit people in different ways</text>
  <text start="256" dur="5.15">at different times</text>
  <text start="258.269" dur="8.251">and you know companies you&amp;#39;ll see cut a</text>
  <text start="261.15" dur="6.9">wave of layoffs in the beginning and you</text>
  <text start="266.52" dur="3.45">know everyone will say it&amp;#39;s contained</text>
  <text start="268.05" dur="4.26">because this is what they like to do</text>
  <text start="269.97" dur="4.919">that you&amp;#39;ll see it come down they&amp;#39;ll say</text>
  <text start="272.31" dur="4.65">everything is contained don&amp;#39;t worry we</text>
  <text start="274.889" dur="4.74">have it under control the market might</text>
  <text start="276.96" dur="4.859">go up a tiny little bit but but then</text>
  <text start="279.629" dur="5.76">again boom it&amp;#39;s going to head down even</text>
  <text start="281.819" dur="5.791">further and I think you know this is how</text>
  <text start="285.389" dur="6.391">we&amp;#39;re going to see it because it gives</text>
  <text start="287.61" dur="8.16">them extra time and it kind of eases</text>
  <text start="291.78" dur="8.37">everyone into this new paradigm that</text>
  <text start="295.77" dur="6.889">will be entering we&amp;#39;re hardly where</text>
  <text start="300.15" dur="5.43">unemployment is really really high</text>
  <text start="302.659" dur="6.581">people have lost their money bank</text>
  <text start="305.58" dur="6.66">accounts have been frozen and they want</text>
  <text start="309.24" dur="5.519">to and if you also notice they do test</text>
  <text start="312.24" dur="4.829">all of this I mean they want to see the</text>
  <text start="314.759" dur="4.141">response and they want to see how the</text>
  <text start="317.069" dur="4.35">American people are going to react now</text>
  <text start="318.9" dur="3.78">if everyone goes okay you know take our</text>
  <text start="321.419" dur="3.211">money we want to save the country</text>
  <text start="322.68" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re just the next time it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="324.63" dur="3.599">going to keep doing it and it raised the</text>
  <text start="326.43" dur="4.739">percentages almost like what they did</text>
  <text start="328.229" dur="4.861">with the income tax okay we need to</text>
  <text start="331.169" dur="4.5">raise taxes but it will only be on the</text>
  <text start="333.09" dur="4.829">rich and everyone said okay let&amp;#39;s do it</text>
  <text start="335.669" dur="4.291">you see how it was incremental it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="337.919" dur="5.28">all at once and I think they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="339.96" dur="6.75">try the same thing here and the last the</text>
  <text start="343.199" dur="6.12">last ditch effort will be to get</text>
  <text start="346.71" dur="5.34">everyone&amp;#39;s money to bring us into war</text>
  <text start="349.319" dur="5.041">and this is going to be a very tricky</text>
  <text start="352.05" dur="3.899">game that they&amp;#39;re playing and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="354.36" dur="3.6">going to have to see how this whole</text>
  <text start="355.949" dur="4.02">entire thing plays out but that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="357.96" dur="4.109">what I feel like that they&amp;#39;re setting us</text>
  <text start="359.969" dur="6.271">up for when they say they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="362.069" dur="6.57">taper off a QE they want to see how the</text>
  <text start="366.24" dur="4.35">markets react they want to see you know</text>
  <text start="368.639" dur="5.011">they taper off a little bit the markets</text>
  <text start="370.59" dur="5.31">come down the Japanese are losing</text>
  <text start="373.65" dur="4.35">control they&amp;#39;re testing the waters to</text>
  <text start="375.9" dur="4.5">see how people react they do a couple</text>
  <text start="378" dur="4.979">ballons and they want to see how</text>
  <text start="380.4" dur="5.879">everything goes again they have the</text>
  <text start="382.979" dur="5.131">document back in December of 2012 cyprus</text>
  <text start="386.279" dur="3.961">they used it there you&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="388.11" dur="3.94">it happen in europe and as we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="390.24" dur="5.59">worrying about these</text>
  <text start="392.05" dur="6.089">small dips in the market Japan will be</text>
  <text start="395.83" dur="4.89">reeling out of control it will be</text>
  <text start="398.139" dur="4.59">spreading through Europe America will</text>
  <text start="400.72" dur="4.05">not know anything about that because</text>
  <text start="402.729" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;ll be dealing with our little you</text>
  <text start="404.77" dur="5.07">know three four five six hundred point</text>
  <text start="407.229" dur="5.881">drop and we will know nothing really of</text>
  <text start="409.84" dur="5.069">what&amp;#39;s going on out overseas because the</text>
  <text start="413.11" dur="4.08">mainstream media will not report</text>
  <text start="414.909" dur="6.63">anything and most of the people will not</text>
  <text start="417.19" dur="6.539">see anything and this is how I think</text>
  <text start="421.539" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re going to approach this entire</text>
  <text start="423.729" dur="3.72">situation at least that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="425.349" dur="4.231">going to try to do who knows if it will</text>
  <text start="427.449" dur="3.571">work or not but I was thinking about</text>
  <text start="429.58" dur="3.799">this and you know if you guys have a</text>
  <text start="431.02" dur="5.07">comment you want to say something</text>
  <text start="433.379" dur="4.331">because everything that they&amp;#39;re setting</text>
  <text start="436.09" dur="3.9">up right now it seems like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="437.71" dur="4.94">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re accelerating</text>
  <text start="439.99" dur="6.299">everything especially with Kokesh</text>
  <text start="442.65" dur="7.269">marching July 4th and it was just a</text>
  <text start="446.289" dur="9.35">March with loaded weapons on DC now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="449.919" dur="5.72">a revolution revolutionary March uh</text>
  <text start="456.389" dur="5.291">across the country he&amp;#39;s calling everyone</text>
  <text start="459.219" dur="5.551">to march with a loaded weapon on the</text>
  <text start="461.68" dur="7.919">Capitol and I think this is a really bad</text>
  <text start="464.77" dur="7.92">idea this really does scream false flag</text>
  <text start="469.599" dur="5.97">because whenever you call something a</text>
  <text start="472.69" dur="6.81">revolution and you&amp;#39;re telling people to</text>
  <text start="475.569" dur="5.97">you know march with loaded weapons all</text>
  <text start="479.5" dur="7.219">you have to do is plant a couple people</text>
  <text start="481.539" dur="8.071">start the shoot out and we the military</text>
  <text start="486.719" dur="6.82">which now has the authorization without</text>
  <text start="489.61" dur="7.47">the President or governor&amp;#39;s to put boots</text>
  <text start="493.539" dur="7.321">on the ground can come in and beat down</text>
  <text start="497.08" dur="5.01">the revolutionary people even though</text>
  <text start="500.86" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re the ones who really didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="502.09" dur="6.75">anything and America will be looking at</text>
  <text start="504.52" dur="6.389">this and the it just it&amp;#39;s just not going</text>
  <text start="508.84" dur="3.6">to be good especially when they start</text>
  <text start="510.909" dur="4.101">blaming it on gun owners I remember I</text>
  <text start="512.44" dur="5.459">said there was going to be another event</text>
  <text start="515.01" dur="5.829">another type of shooting or some type of</text>
  <text start="517.899" dur="6.001">an event to get the guns and it looks</text>
  <text start="520.839" dur="4.861">like they&amp;#39;re ramping this up big time</text>
  <text start="523.9" dur="2.76">and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to say and</text>
  <text start="525.7" dur="3.66">especially when they do it on</text>
  <text start="526.66" dur="4.11">Independence Day I mean how perfect I</text>
  <text start="529.36" dur="4.2">mean look when they did the Boston</text>
  <text start="530.77" dur="6.03">bombing I mean it just looks like</text>
  <text start="533.56" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re trying to do these things but</text>
  <text start="536.8" dur="4.29">most of the time it doesn&amp;#39;t work out I</text>
  <text start="538.96" dur="3.96">mean look in England I mean that the two</text>
  <text start="541.09" dur="3.3">reports of the guy one with blood on his</text>
  <text start="542.92" dur="3.42">hands one without blood on his hands</text>
  <text start="544.39" dur="4.41">there was no blood in the street they</text>
  <text start="546.34" dur="5.37">were trying to build up people to have</text>
  <text start="548.8" dur="5.37">riots about Muslims and to get into war</text>
  <text start="551.71" dur="6.48">and it&amp;#39;s just that whole thing is</text>
  <text start="554.17" dur="8.25">falling apart also but let&amp;#39;s move on</text>
  <text start="558.19" dur="7.35">here you know a rocket was fired at</text>
  <text start="562.42" dur="5.76">israel from south lebanon and basically</text>

  <text start="568.18" dur="7.05">they&amp;#39;re being shot at and it&amp;#39;s all to</text>
  <text start="571.09" dur="6.3">provoke this war that they need and now</text>
  <text start="575.23" dur="4.11">to get this war going there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="577.39" dur="4.02">different things coming up we CL many</text>
  <text start="579.34" dur="8.1">different potential false flags coming</text>
  <text start="581.41" dur="11.13">up I have them listed on the homepage of</text>

  <text start="634.69" dur="5.58">put into the wrong hands it could be</text>
  <text start="636.28" dur="6.75">made into something else there there is</text>
  <text start="640.27" dur="4.94">also am a 21st a three-day metro y</text>
  <text start="643.03" dur="5.37">disaster drill which will simulate</text>
  <text start="645.21" dur="5.8">bioterrorism attack well may 21st has</text>

  <text start="653.14" dur="6.91">national scout jamboree</text>
  <text start="656.089" dur="6.841">and this could also be a false flag</text>

  <text start="875.01" dur="5.25">interesting to me is we&amp;#39;re still getting</text>
  <text start="878.13" dur="3.569">you know from iran they&amp;#39;re attacking the</text>
  <text start="880.26" dur="3.78">infrastructure as we know because this</text>
  <text start="881.699" dur="4.291">is setting up the main cyber attack but</text>
  <text start="884.04" dur="6.39">now obama is blaming the internet for</text>
  <text start="885.99" dur="7.469">domestic terrorism and he goes on to say</text>
  <text start="890.43" dur="5.3">when he was talking in a speech today a</text>
  <text start="893.459" dur="4.981">person can consume hateful propaganda</text>

  <text start="908.91" dur="4.98">just a little ridiculous but to me what</text>
  <text start="911.91" dur="4.53">he&amp;#39;s saying is that we need to pass</text>
  <text start="913.89" dur="5.88">sista we need to take control of the</text>
  <text start="916.44" dur="6.12">Internet to block certain alternative</text>
  <text start="919.77" dur="4.23">alternative media sites so they do not</text>

  <text start="924" dur="6.45">what&amp;#39;s really going on and you know</text>
  <text start="928.23" dur="3.75">basically the reality is is that the</text>
  <text start="930.45" dur="3.87">Internet is the largest threat to</text>
  <text start="931.98" dur="4.41">corrupt government officials it&amp;#39;s how we</text>
  <text start="934.32" dur="4.32">managed to break open the entire IRS</text>
  <text start="936.39" dur="3.99">scandal that has blown up in Obama&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="942.69" dur="6.72">for targeting Constitution groups based</text>
  <text start="944.85" dur="7.29">groups with phony financial assaults so</text>
  <text start="949.41" dur="4.83">this whole thing is basically on the</text>
  <text start="952.14" dur="4.29">internet and he&amp;#39;s also throwing in</text>
  <text start="954.24" dur="3.96">domestic terrorists because he likes to</text>
  <text start="956.43" dur="5.7">throw the government officials like to</text>
  <text start="958.2" dur="6.93">keep pounding it in the Americans minds</text>
  <text start="962.13" dur="5.16">who are sleeping that there are domestic</text>
  <text start="965.13" dur="5.82">terrorists and to look out for them just</text>
  <text start="967.29" dur="5.9">like the DHS with the Indy 500 on their</text>
  <text start="970.95" dur="5.7">twitter feed and on their homepage</text>
  <text start="973.19" dur="8.08">they&amp;#39;re going with the same slogan as</text>
  <text start="976.65" dur="6.66">Nazi Germany in also in New York if you</text>
  <text start="981.27" dur="4.35">see something say something without</text>
  <text start="983.31" dur="4.55">telling anyone to what should we be</text>
  <text start="985.62" dur="4.38">looking for what what are the guidelines</text>
  <text start="987.86" dur="3.79">basically they want you to report on</text>
  <text start="990" dur="3.78">anything and they&amp;#39;ll take it from there</text>
  <text start="991.65" dur="4.56">and this is what happened in Nazi</text>
  <text start="993.78" dur="4.59">Germany I mean the same exact thing you</text>
  <text start="996.21" dur="5.51">see something say you see something say</text>
  <text start="998.37" dur="6.32">something when i did my report on the</text>
  <text start="1001.72" dur="5.11">Great Depression and I compared to</text>
  <text start="1004.69" dur="7.11">basically what the collapse was going to</text>
  <text start="1006.83" dur="9.24">be like and for those of you who haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1011.8" dur="7.06">listened to those go back and let me</text>
  <text start="1016.07" dur="5.4">tell you what episodes they are go back</text>
  <text start="1018.86" dur="5.04">to episode six and go forward from there</text>
  <text start="1021.47" dur="5.76">six seven eight nine that&amp;#39;s where I took</text>
  <text start="1023.9" dur="5.73">the great depression and I compared it</text>
  <text start="1027.23" dur="6.27">to what was happening right now and then</text>
  <text start="1029.63" dur="6.78">I went further and I decided to let you</text>
  <text start="1033.5" dur="4.89">know what it would be like compared to</text>
  <text start="1036.41" dur="5.37">the Great Depression but I moved it into</text>
  <text start="1038.39" dur="5.76">the future of what the collapse would be</text>
  <text start="1041.78" dur="5.309">like when the whole thing fell apart and</text>
  <text start="1044.15" dur="6.42">for those people who want to get a taste</text>
  <text start="1047.089" dur="6.09">of what the collapse will be like just</text>
  <text start="1050.57" dur="4.35">start at episode 6 and go forward and I</text>
  <text start="1053.179" dur="3.191">run through that and I made up a</text>
  <text start="1054.92" dur="4.28">scenario</text>
  <text start="1056.37" dur="8.7">using the fax from the Great Depression</text>
  <text start="1059.2" dur="8.1">and I used what happened back then and</text>
  <text start="1065.07" dur="6.4">used it for what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="1067.3" dur="6.12">and it basically goes right before the</text>
  <text start="1071.47" dur="3.87">collapse and then after the collapse so</text>
  <text start="1073.42" dur="6.08">if anybody wants to you know revisit</text>
  <text start="1075.34" dur="8.85">that or hear that started episode 6 and</text>
  <text start="1079.5" dur="7.54">basically I&amp;#39;m moving on I mean this this</text>
  <text start="1084.19" dur="5.19">article also that the US utilities say</text>
  <text start="1087.04" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re under constant attack basically</text>
  <text start="1089.38" dur="5.76">the the utilities came out to say that</text>
  <text start="1092.5" dur="4.77">you know they kind of disagree with the</text>
  <text start="1095.14" dur="3.78">reports because they&amp;#39;re getting the</text>
  <text start="1097.27" dur="3.75">normal everyday attacks that they always</text>
  <text start="1098.92" dur="6.6">get and they feel that they&amp;#39;re pretty</text>
  <text start="1101.02" dur="6.24">secure in what they have and basically</text>
  <text start="1105.52" dur="4.71">what they says but utilities turn the</text>
  <text start="1107.26" dur="4.38">report as overblown saying their systems</text>
  <text start="1110.23" dur="3.06">were adequately protected through</text>

  <text start="1205.99" dur="6.18">they have different methods of doing it</text>
  <text start="1208.39" dur="6.33">but an everyday normal cyber attack will</text>
  <text start="1212.17" dur="5.43">not be able to do this same thing with</text>
  <text start="1214.72" dur="4.71">the power infrastructure it&amp;#39;s really not</text>
  <text start="1217.6" dur="3.69">going to be coming from I mean if you</text>

  <text start="1232.03" dur="4.53">into the inside and plan something</text>
  <text start="1234.25" dur="5.79">because I did read some reports that</text>
  <text start="1236.56" dur="6.54">that 2003 power outage some of the</text>

  <text start="1248.23" dur="4.44">the whole thing down and then there were</text>
  <text start="1250.48" dur="4.53">other reports at something that said</text>
  <text start="1252.67" dur="4.41">something completely different so I</text>

  <text start="1257.08" dur="4.77">side jobs they&amp;#39;re going to get inside</text>
  <text start="1259.51" dur="4.5">somehow and then they&amp;#39;ll use the cyber</text>
  <text start="1261.85" dur="4.79">attack and you know and and everything</text>
  <text start="1264.01" dur="8.76">will will completely come tumbling down</text>
  <text start="1266.64" dur="11.95">now the Red Cross is warning that unrest</text>

  <text start="1502.289" dur="4.921">going to take people by surprise but not</text>
  <text start="1504.539" dur="5.82">all at once they got to bring them in</text>
  <text start="1507.21" dur="5.669">slowly and this is what they like to do</text>
  <text start="1510.359" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s going to be a slow thing and then</text>
  <text start="1512.879" dur="4.53">make them feel good and it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>

  <text start="1540.809" dur="3.2">know I just take the whole damn thing</text>
  <text start="1541.83" dur="4.77">already and this is what people will do</text>
  <text start="1544.009" dur="5.11">but if you haven&amp;#39;t prepared already i</text>
  <text start="1546.6" dur="5.639">would start preparing and taking your</text>
  <text start="1549.119" dur="6">money out of the banks or try to do</text>
  <text start="1552.239" dur="6.331">something with your pension plans put</text>
  <text start="1555.119" dur="5.28">some of it into gold and silver I don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1560.399" dur="7.11">is going to skyrocket after a couple you</text>
  <text start="1564.929" dur="4.44">know the first mini crash and then a</text>
  <text start="1567.509" dur="4.831">little bit later all of a sudden people</text>
  <text start="1569.369" dur="5.88">will start realizing what is happening</text>
  <text start="1572.34" dur="6.12">and people will start heading out of the</text>
  <text start="1575.249" dur="6">stock market and into gold real hard</text>
  <text start="1578.46" dur="4.98">assets they will not race into the</text>
  <text start="1581.249" dur="4.471">dollar they will not race into the euro</text>
  <text start="1583.44" dur="4.949">they&amp;#39;ll start to realize what is going</text>
  <text start="1585.72" dur="4.939">on but by that time the gold and silver</text>
  <text start="1588.389" dur="3.98">prices will be getting very very high</text>

  <text start="1592.369" dur="4.26">start to rush in it will start to</text>
  <text start="1594.2" dur="5.279">skyrocket but I believe they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1596.629" dur="8.43">try to keep the gold and silver down as</text>
  <text start="1599.479" dur="9.78">low as possible until the last moment</text>
  <text start="1605.059" dur="6.24">and when you see the first mini type of</text>
  <text start="1609.259" dur="4.561">crash they will be able to keep that</text>
  <text start="1611.299" dur="4.531">soul silver and gold down they will be</text>
  <text start="1613.82" dur="3.059">able to take the money from the accounts</text>
  <text start="1615.83" dur="3.36">and the pension plans which they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1616.879" dur="4.89">already started with the pensions and it</text>
  <text start="1619.19" dur="5.13">will be a slow little tiny thing and</text>
  <text start="1621.769" dur="4.71">people will be none the wiser especially</text>
  <text start="1624.32" dur="4.38">those who are sleeping oh no don&amp;#39;t worry</text>

  <text start="1646.33" dur="5.289">this is what we need to be careful of</text>
  <text start="1648.739" dur="7.38">because this is how they will approach</text>
  <text start="1651.619" dur="7.41">it very slowly very methodically just so</text>
  <text start="1656.119" dur="4.831">no one catches on what is going on</text>
