  <text start="70.74" dur="4.62">is looking at this debt they put they</text>
  <text start="72.96" dur="4.53">formed a special committee and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="75.36" dur="6.24">looking to see which debt was created</text>
  <text start="77.49" dur="7.199">illegally fraudulently and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="81.6" dur="4.26">to basically label that odious debt</text>

  <text start="85.86" dur="4.71">responsible for this and we see already</text>
  <text start="89.189" dur="4.5">that they&amp;#39;ve been making deals with</text>
  <text start="90.57" dur="4.979">Russia signing new deals hoping they</text>

  <text start="119.61" dur="7.53">country not able to find work and we can</text>
  <text start="123.93" dur="7.139">see that Greece might be pivoting</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="7.519">towards Russia and it seems as every day</text>
  <text start="131.069" dur="6.78">that goes by they seem to</text>
  <text start="134.659" dur="5.28">move in that direction we see Greece is</text>
  <text start="137.849" dur="5.87">exerting every effort for the sake of</text>
  <text start="139.939" dur="7.5">lifting sanctions against Russia and</text>

  <text start="166.53" dur="4.049">going to say well wait a minute we would</text>
  <text start="168.72" dur="4.829">like the same thing because we have a</text>
  <text start="170.579" dur="4.47">stockpile and we don&amp;#39;t know what to do</text>
  <text start="173.549" dur="5.071">with it we&amp;#39;re losing billions upon</text>

  <text start="306.069" dur="7.621">all those people we&amp;#39;re seeing more</text>
  <text start="309.52" dur="6.54">layoffs more store closings and again</text>
  <text start="313.69" dur="6.59">this is a domino effect it will affect</text>
  <text start="316.06" dur="8.609">everything we see the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="320.28" dur="6.069">hovering around 580 points sometimes it</text>
  <text start="324.669" dur="5.4">moves up a couple points then it moves</text>
  <text start="326.349" dur="6.181">down but it&amp;#39;s staying even it&amp;#39;s nowhere</text>

  <text start="332.53" dur="8.879">before or the year before that it is way</text>
  <text start="335.86" dur="7.44">off it is on a downward trend and we see</text>
  <text start="341.409" dur="4.611">here in the United States what do we see</text>

  <text start="389.71" dur="10.5">worse as June of 2009 we are not</text>
  <text start="395.169" dur="10.071">manufacturing anymore countries</text>
  <text start="400.21" dur="7.679">people are having a hard time surviving</text>
  <text start="405.24" dur="5.079">they don&amp;#39;t have the income they don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="421.21" dur="3.709">they don&amp;#39;t need the raw material and</text>
  <text start="422.86" dur="6.98">this is why we see the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="424.919" dur="7.961">staying where it is and it reflects in</text>
  <text start="429.84" dur="7.71">each one of the countries of how the</text>
  <text start="432.88" dur="8.009">people are doing they&amp;#39;re not doing well</text>
  <text start="437.55" dur="6.459">but of course here we see the home</text>
  <text start="440.889" dur="5.611">builders in the United States they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="444.009" dur="3.47">very confident a National Association of</text>

  <text start="447.479" dur="5.141">they&amp;#39;re very optimistic about this</text>
  <text start="449.979" dur="5.521">spring summer of course they should be</text>
  <text start="452.62" dur="6.12">because this is their hot time to sell</text>
  <text start="455.5" dur="4.949">this real estate this is when people put</text>
  <text start="458.74" dur="4.169">their houses up for sale they plant</text>
  <text start="460.449" dur="3.84">flowers they try to bring in the people</text>
  <text start="462.909" dur="4.23">they try to get the highest price for</text>
  <text start="464.289" dur="6.171">their house and we see that the optimism</text>
  <text start="467.139" dur="5.791">surge 2:56 beating expectations of 55</text>

  <text start="472.93" dur="6.2">is back on track now they&amp;#39;re hoping very</text>
  <text start="476.77" dur="5.22">big difference between hope and reality</text>
  <text start="479.13" dur="6.159">yes we all have hope but then reality</text>
  <text start="481.99" dur="4.859">sets in and shows us that it&amp;#39;s not doing</text>
  <text start="485.289" dur="4.591">what everyone thought it was going to do</text>
  <text start="486.849" dur="5.461">we see weekly mortgage applications drop</text>
  <text start="489.88" dur="5.31">as soon as the rates tick up a little</text>
  <text start="492.31" dur="6.51">bit I noticed the mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="495.19" dur="5.34">dive down now can you imagine if the</text>
  <text start="498.82" dur="3.75">mortgage rates went up by a full</text>
  <text start="500.53" dur="6">percentage point or two percentage</text>
  <text start="502.57" dur="8.849">points it would crash this is a sign to</text>
  <text start="506.53" dur="6.84">let you know what will happen they</text>
  <text start="511.419" dur="6.031">ticked up a little bit and mortgage</text>
  <text start="513.37" dur="8.07">applications fell by 3% because once</text>
  <text start="517.45" dur="5.61">they tick up people need more money to</text>
  <text start="521.44" dur="4.17">put down on the house your payments go</text>
  <text start="523.06" dur="4.14">up and it knocks a lot of people out of</text>
  <text start="525.61" dur="7.79">the running to purchase that home if</text>
  <text start="527.2" dur="6.2">they go up 1% or 2% forget about it</text>
  <text start="533.43" dur="5.13">and this is why they continually fall</text>
  <text start="536.339" dur="3.781">and this is why the central banking</text>
  <text start="538.56" dur="5.7">system is trying to get the keep the</text>
  <text start="540.12" dur="8.969">interest rates at zero percent as low as</text>

  <text start="588.93" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s with you forever and of course the</text>
  <text start="592.83" dur="3.96">central bankers would like to change</text>

  <text start="601.41" dur="5.25">seeing right now is that these students</text>
  <text start="605.16" dur="3.38">who are getting these jobs most of them</text>
  <text start="606.66" dur="5.25">are in the food industry part-time work</text>
  <text start="608.54" dur="5.77">still living with their parents and a</text>

  <text start="659.7" dur="6.03">this is the problem if we break it down</text>
  <text start="662.31" dur="4.64">on a monthly basis what do we see well</text>
  <text start="665.73" dur="3.95">we see nearly</text>

  <text start="725.81" dur="7.23">to straining the public purse bad jobs</text>
  <text start="729.019" dur="5.971">maybe bigger problem then no jobs and we</text>

  <text start="929.65" dur="4.74">strange to me where they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="932.41" dur="3.78">closing about five different</text>

  <text start="942.55" dur="7.26">oh it&amp;#39;s very interesting is that none of</text>

  <text start="949.81" dur="5.37">any plumbing permits for future repairs</text>
  <text start="952.6" dur="6.51">so is that really the reason why they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="959.11" dur="6.45">a store of that size in five different</text>

  <text start="995.92" dur="5.4">if we&amp;#39;re in a recovery and people are</text>
  <text start="998.59" dur="5.94">working revenues coming in why are they</text>
  <text start="1001.32" dur="5.94">having this problem so all the evidence</text>
  <text start="1004.53" dur="6.09">now is pointing to yeah we&amp;#39;re not in a</text>
  <text start="1007.26" dur="7.01">recovery we&amp;#39;re in a collapse scenario</text>
  <text start="1010.62" dur="7.32">but they&amp;#39;re never going to admit it in</text>
  <text start="1014.27" dur="6.79">Europe they&amp;#39;ve dropped the interest</text>

  <text start="1021.06" dur="5.06">at negative interest rates and the vast</text>
  <text start="1023.97" dur="5.489">majority of mortgages like in Portugal</text>
  <text start="1026.12" dur="6.64">some in Italy some in Spain are tied to</text>

  <text start="1035.579" dur="5.731">drops low enough banks will have to pay</text>
  <text start="1037.829" dur="7.981">borrowers and it already is happening in</text>
  <text start="1041.31" dur="8.91">Spain those people that have mortgages</text>
  <text start="1045.81" dur="7.26">the bank is subtracting their interest</text>
  <text start="1050.22" dur="6.63">and giving it back to them and this is</text>
  <text start="1053.07" dur="5.82">the Spanish bank bank inter and this is</text>
  <text start="1056.85" dur="7.44">the seventh largest lender by market</text>
  <text start="1058.89" dur="7.09">value and basically why is the interest</text>
  <text start="1064.29" dur="4.84">rate so low</text>
  <text start="1065.98" dur="6.98">because if they let it go up the entire</text>
  <text start="1069.13" dur="6.15">system will collapse in a second and</text>
  <text start="1072.96" dur="4.81">this is why they&amp;#39;re not letting it</text>
  <text start="1075.28" dur="3.2">happen they can&amp;#39;t they can&amp;#39;t let it</text>
  <text start="1077.77" dur="5.58">happen</text>
  <text start="1078.48" dur="6.91">we saw it back in 2007 going into 2008</text>
  <text start="1083.35" dur="5.39">the interest rate crept up the interest</text>
  <text start="1085.39" dur="8.91">rate crept up as it kept going up sales</text>
  <text start="1088.74" dur="8.29">declined traffic dried up people left</text>
  <text start="1094.3" dur="3.93">their homes with all the furniture in</text>
  <text start="1097.03" dur="5.1">there they just left they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1098.23" dur="8.16">afford it and everything accelerated and</text>
  <text start="1102.13" dur="6.84">it got worse and it got worse and the</text>
  <text start="1106.39" dur="5.73">market went down businesses started to</text>
  <text start="1108.97" dur="7.43">layoff this same thing is going to</text>
  <text start="1112.12" dur="7.44">happen we&amp;#39;re heading down that path and</text>
  <text start="1116.4" dur="4.93">of course the government is continually</text>
  <text start="1119.56" dur="4.35">taxing the poor they want to add more</text>
  <text start="1121.33" dur="4.68">taxes Obamacare is one of those taxes</text>
  <text start="1123.91" dur="4.47">even though you don&amp;#39;t think it is a tax</text>
  <text start="1126.01" dur="4.32">it is a tax it is not a benefit for the</text>
  <text start="1128.38" dur="4.29">people you don&amp;#39;t need a penalty if you</text>
  <text start="1130.33" dur="4.26">do not want it again it should be the</text>
  <text start="1132.67" dur="8.25">choice of the people not the choice of</text>
  <text start="1134.59" dur="9.69">the government but there was a person</text>
  <text start="1140.92" dur="6.12">who was about 26 years old and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1144.28" dur="6.47">saying you know something health</text>
  <text start="1147.04" dur="8.01">insurance is not cheap basically that</text>
  <text start="1150.75" dur="6.22">person couldn&amp;#39;t get insurance their</text>
  <text start="1155.05" dur="3.89">parents insurance expired</text>
  <text start="1156.97" dur="4.92">he couldn&amp;#39;t be under there anymore and</text>
  <text start="1158.94" dur="6.37">he did not receive health insurance from</text>
  <text start="1161.89" dur="5.16">his employer he was a consultant so he</text>
  <text start="1165.31" dur="5.07">went to the Delaware marketplace like</text>
  <text start="1167.05" dur="7.11">thousands of other Delawareans who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1170.38" dur="5.94">have health insurance and they were he</text>
  <text start="1174.16" dur="4.2">was introduced to four different metal</text>
  <text start="1176.32" dur="5.88">plans those are the different plans they</text>
  <text start="1178.36" dur="5.91">have there and basically since he is</text>
  <text start="1182.2" dur="4.71">under 30 he&amp;#39;s eligible for a</text>
  <text start="1184.27" dur="4.92">catastrophic plan and the price for the</text>
  <text start="1186.91" dur="4.05">cheapest available catastrophic plan on</text>
  <text start="1189.19" dur="4.98">the Delaware health insurance exchange</text>
  <text start="1190.96" dur="6.15">was roughly a hundred and ninety dollars</text>
  <text start="1194.17" dur="5.19">per month with a deductible of six</text>
  <text start="1197.11" dur="2.7">thousand six hundred so think about this</text>
  <text start="1199.36" dur="5.16">first</text>
  <text start="1199.81" dur="8.4">and he will have to pay eight thousand</text>
  <text start="1204.52" dur="7.11">eight hundred dollars before insurance</text>
  <text start="1208.21" dur="5.34">kicks in so he will pay he&amp;#39;ll be paying</text>
  <text start="1211.63" dur="3.87">a hundred nine dollars a month 190 a</text>
  <text start="1213.55" dur="3.27">month and when he has to go to the</text>
  <text start="1215.5" dur="3.9">doctor and it&amp;#39;s a two hundred Olive bill</text>
  <text start="1216.82" dur="5.31">its out-of-pocket so he spent 190 plus</text>
  <text start="1219.4" dur="4.98">of 200 if he goes again to the doctor he</text>
  <text start="1222.13" dur="5.7">stole until he reaches the six thousand</text>
  <text start="1224.38" dur="6.72">six hundred deductible and then the</text>
  <text start="1227.83" dur="5.18">deductible starts again the next year so</text>
  <text start="1231.1" dur="6.24">if he doesn&amp;#39;t meet it</text>
  <text start="1233.01" dur="5.86">he just paid his premium and he paid</text>
  <text start="1237.34" dur="4.8">everything out-of-pocket and that it</text>
  <text start="1238.87" dur="5.4">resets the next year so every year he</text>
  <text start="1242.14" dur="4.53">will have to owe eight thousand eight</text>
  <text start="1244.27" dur="3.87">hundred and eighty dollars and of course</text>
  <text start="1246.67" dur="3.57">we know the premiums will go up so that</text>
  <text start="1248.14" dur="5.13">number will go up is that really a</text>
  <text start="1250.24" dur="5.52">benefit and he tried to be subsidized</text>
  <text start="1253.27" dur="5.25">but he did not qualify for subsidized</text>
  <text start="1255.76" dur="5.64">for to be subsidized on the health</text>
  <text start="1258.52" dur="7.44">insurance this is not a benefit this</text>
  <text start="1261.4" dur="8.79">existed before the only difference today</text>
  <text start="1265.96" dur="6.36">is they&amp;#39;re forcing you to get it and the</text>
  <text start="1270.19" dur="4.74">insurance companies are profiting</text>
  <text start="1272.32" dur="5.07">upfront from it because this is what</text>
  <text start="1274.93" dur="4.32">happened when they created it the</text>
  <text start="1277.39" dur="4.5">insurance companies wrote the entire law</text>
  <text start="1279.25" dur="4.41">it only benefited themselves and the</text>
  <text start="1281.89" dur="5.31">government to bring in revenue for taxes</text>
  <text start="1283.66" dur="6.48">and there was no benefit for the people</text>
  <text start="1287.2" dur="6.96">because look how the insurance companies</text>
  <text start="1290.14" dur="6.29">can avoid paying out it&amp;#39;s a perfect plan</text>
  <text start="1294.16" dur="5.79">for them it&amp;#39;s not perfect for the people</text>
  <text start="1296.43" dur="6.04">now we understand that the US government</text>
  <text start="1299.95" dur="4.53">central bankers they basically are</text>
  <text start="1302.47" dur="3.42">trying to remove the rights from the</text>
  <text start="1304.48" dur="4.86">people I mean they love to have the</text>
  <text start="1305.89" dur="6.12">Constitution gone because we can see how</text>
  <text start="1309.34" dur="4.59">they react without a constitution in</text>
  <text start="1312.01" dur="3.84">other countries and what they do to the</text>
  <text start="1313.93" dur="3.57">people there and they would love to do</text>
  <text start="1315.85" dur="4.2">the same thing here in the United States</text>
  <text start="1317.5" dur="4.29">but that pesky Constitution and the</text>
  <text start="1320.05" dur="3.87">rights of the people it always gets in</text>
  <text start="1321.79" dur="3.99">the way and we can see right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1323.92" dur="4.92">trying to chip away at their rights</text>
  <text start="1325.78" dur="4.5">especially the Second Amendment and we</text>
  <text start="1328.84" dur="3.45">understand that they&amp;#39;re trying to take</text>
  <text start="1330.28" dur="3.13">the weapons away from the people they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1332.29" dur="2.95">been trying for quite</text>
  <text start="1333.41" dur="3.78">while this is why they create thousands</text>
  <text start="1335.24" dur="3.96">upon thousands of laws this is why</text>
  <text start="1337.19" dur="5.24">they&amp;#39;re bringing up new different types</text>
  <text start="1339.2" dur="6.66">of tactics of looking at mental illness</text>
  <text start="1342.43" dur="5.88">trying to ban ammunition and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1345.86" dur="4.71">doing many other different things one</text>
  <text start="1348.31" dur="3.94">way they were trying to do it is they</text>
  <text start="1350.57" dur="5.94">were trying to have the investors tell</text>
  <text start="1352.25" dur="6.81">stores what they can and cannot sell and</text>
  <text start="1356.51" dur="5.61">they did this to Walmart Walmart was</text>
  <text start="1359.06" dur="6.48">selling rifles they sell you know</text>
  <text start="1362.12" dur="5.07">hunting equipment ammunition and the</text>
  <text start="1365.54" dur="4.2">investors said you know something we</text>
  <text start="1367.19" dur="4.62">don&amp;#39;t want you to sell rifles and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1369.74" dur="4.62">gonna have to listen to us and Walmart</text>
  <text start="1371.81" dur="4.89">said no well we don&amp;#39;t want to listen to</text>
  <text start="1374.36" dur="5.49">you you can&amp;#39;t dictate what we can or</text>
  <text start="1376.7" dur="7.65">cannot sell so basically what happened</text>
  <text start="1379.85" dur="7.59">is the investors went to court Walmart</text>
  <text start="1384.35" dur="4.95">went to court and the judge decided the</text>
  <text start="1387.44" dur="5.19">investors have no right to tell the</text>
  <text start="1389.3" dur="6.35">company on what to sell if they want to</text>
  <text start="1392.63" dur="5.88">sell rifles they have every right to and</text>
  <text start="1395.65" dur="5.71">basically what they&amp;#39;re saying is that</text>
  <text start="1398.51" dur="8.04">the investors do not have the right to</text>
  <text start="1401.36" dur="9.96">tell a company on how to run the store</text>
  <text start="1406.55" dur="7.83">and again we can see they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1411.32" dur="5.4">do whatever they possibly can to stop</text>
  <text start="1414.38" dur="4.68">stores from selling weapons I mean look</text>
  <text start="1416.72" dur="5.46">at operation choke point the Obama</text>
  <text start="1419.06" dur="7.38">administration is cutting off the</text>
  <text start="1422.18" dur="8.12">funding for those stores that sell</text>
  <text start="1426.44" dur="6.86">firearms and they can&amp;#39;t process Visa</text>
  <text start="1430.3" dur="5.38">MasterCard American Express and</text>
  <text start="1433.3" dur="5.32">basically they&amp;#39;re stopping those stores</text>
  <text start="1435.68" dur="5.01">from operating and it&amp;#39;s not because they</text>
  <text start="1438.62" dur="5.28">did something wrong it&amp;#39;s because they</text>
  <text start="1440.69" dur="6.27">don&amp;#39;t like those stores and this is what</text>

  <text start="1588.21" dur="4.589">but we&amp;#39;re seeing inflation and others</text>
  <text start="1590.159" dur="4.62">and what I think is happening right now</text>

  <text start="1606.06" dur="5.99">right back crashing down and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1607.95" dur="8.76">hyperinflation we see that the NSA CIA</text>

  <text start="1635.01" dur="4.98">noticed 16 Internet Protocol IDs palling</text>
  <text start="1638.4" dur="3.3">out there like what is it all this</text>
  <text start="1639.99" dur="5.73">what&amp;#39;s going on here this is very</text>
  <text start="1641.7" dur="6.51">strange and we can see from all this</text>
  <text start="1645.72" dur="4.71">that they said you know let&amp;#39;s do some</text>
  <text start="1648.21" dur="3.81">testing them and track this down where</text>
  <text start="1650.43" dur="5.43">is all of this going all this</text>
  <text start="1652.02" dur="7.95">information and they went ahead to do it</text>
  <text start="1655.86" dur="6.78">and they did the test and guess what the</text>
  <text start="1659.97" dur="6.27">IP addresses led to a third party</text>
  <text start="1662.64" dur="7.29">observer they ran a trace the trail led</text>

  <text start="1885.1" dur="5.85">of the time they can&amp;#39;t present this to a</text>
  <text start="1888.13" dur="3.9">judge they don&amp;#39;t have any information so</text>
  <text start="1890.95" dur="3.24">they know they&amp;#39;re not going to get the</text>
  <text start="1892.03" dur="6.06">warrants and this is why they do this in</text>
  <text start="1894.19" dur="7.08">secrecy and we understand that many</text>
  <text start="1898.09" dur="5.1">countries now are coming up with these</text>
  <text start="1901.27" dur="5.07">laws which infringe on people&amp;#39;s rights</text>
  <text start="1903.19" dur="5.99">the government&amp;#39;s basically say listen</text>
  <text start="1906.34" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;re going to go out and do what</text>
  <text start="1909.18" dur="5.68">whatever we have to do to stop terrorism</text>
  <text start="1911.65" dur="6.99">if we have to remove a website block it</text>
  <text start="1914.86" dur="6.42">we will do this and we see France they</text>
  <text start="1918.64" dur="5.43">have this law now and they&amp;#39;re putting it</text>
  <text start="1921.28" dur="5.43">into practice France has just blocked a</text>
  <text start="1924.07" dur="5.13">handful of websites it has deemed fair</text>
  <text start="1926.71" dur="6.24">but favorable to terrorists and their</text>
  <text start="1929.2" dur="6.3">organisations so basically what happens</text>
  <text start="1932.95" dur="4.44">here is the government in Paris blocked</text>
  <text start="1935.5" dur="5.04">about five websites it accused of</text>
  <text start="1937.39" dur="5.04">condoning condoning terrorism in what is</text>
  <text start="1940.54" dur="3.6">the first employment of the new</text>
  <text start="1942.43" dur="4.02">government powers that took effect that</text>
  <text start="1944.14" dur="5.37">took effect in February basically what</text>
  <text start="1946.45" dur="6.75">they do is they decide what is and is</text>
  <text start="1949.51" dur="6.63">not terrorism and they don&amp;#39;t there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1953.2" dur="5.07">review of it they just go out and say</text>
  <text start="1956.14" dur="3.74">yeah take that down yeah take that one</text>
  <text start="1958.27" dur="4.5">down</text>
  <text start="1959.88" dur="8.38">basically the Ministry sends a ban order</text>
  <text start="1962.77" dur="8.52">to the website owner and they say take</text>
  <text start="1968.26" dur="4.74">it down if they don&amp;#39;t take it down they</text>
  <text start="1971.29" dur="6.36">go right to the Internet service</text>
  <text start="1973" dur="7.65">provider and they have it blocked so no</text>
  <text start="1977.65" dur="5.79">judge reviews the Interior Ministry&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1980.65" dur="5.73">decision the Minister first requests</text>
  <text start="1983.44" dur="4.56">like I said the website to be taking</text>
  <text start="1986.38" dur="2.94">down if they don&amp;#39;t do it they just go</text>
  <text start="1988" dur="4.71">ahead and they do it so the government</text>
  <text start="1989.32" dur="6.54">is deciding what is and is not offensive</text>
  <text start="1992.71" dur="5.58">to the people well how did the we how do</text>
  <text start="1995.86" dur="4.53">we know that they&amp;#39;re not just taking</text>
  <text start="1998.29" dur="5.94">down any website we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2000.39" dur="7.86">and this is the problem they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="2004.23" dur="6.84">choices for the people and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2008.25" dur="6.299">deciding what is good or bad for the</text>
  <text start="2011.07" dur="6.33">people now it seems that the white house</text>
  <text start="2014.549" dur="6.601">is going to remove Cuba from the state</text>
  <text start="2017.4" dur="5.82">sponsor of terrorism list and Cuba was</text>
  <text start="2021.15" dur="4.98">first placed on the list back in 1982</text>
  <text start="2023.22" dur="5.04">when the u.s. accused Castro the</text>
  <text start="2026.13" dur="4.65">government of Castro of promoting armed</text>
  <text start="2028.26" dur="4.799">revolution by organizations that used</text>
  <text start="2030.78" dur="4.23">terrorism well wait a minute isn&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="2033.059" dur="4.531">what the United States is doing around</text>
  <text start="2035.01" dur="5.61">the globe so basically the United States</text>
  <text start="2037.59" dur="6.54">is a terrorist nation if you really</text>
  <text start="2040.62" dur="4.98">think about it and with Cuba&amp;#39;s removal</text>
  <text start="2044.13" dur="4.46">the only other countries that are left</text>
  <text start="2045.6" dur="6.269">on the u.s. sponsor of terrorism is Iran</text>
  <text start="2048.59" dur="8.17">which that could be removed very soon</text>
  <text start="2051.869" dur="7.5">Sudan and Syria and we can see it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2056.76" dur="4.56">basically those nations they need to</text>
  <text start="2059.369" dur="4.891">take control of isn&amp;#39;t that amazing</text>
  <text start="2061.32" dur="6.539">it&amp;#39;s all the nations they want control</text>
  <text start="2064.26" dur="6.149">of Sudan there&amp;#39;s a war going on Syria</text>
  <text start="2067.859" dur="6">there&amp;#39;s a war going on Iran they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="2070.409" dur="5.161">peace talks right now but again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2073.859" dur="4.921">trying a different tactic with Iran</text>
  <text start="2075.57" dur="4.829">because they saw that they&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="2078.78" dur="4.44">be able to get into Iran any other way</text>
  <text start="2080.399" dur="4.591">so they&amp;#39;re trying all different methods</text>
  <text start="2083.22" dur="4.11">to reach the same goal and that goal is</text>
  <text start="2084.99" dur="4.8">to take over the natural resources place</text>
  <text start="2087.33" dur="6">the US dollar on those natural resources</text>
  <text start="2089.79" dur="7.28">and set up a central bank Russia in</text>
  <text start="2093.33" dur="6.18">Ukraine is getting ready to sue Ukraine</text>

  <text start="2383.25" dur="4.89">make it seem like Russia is doing</text>

  <text start="2622.66" dur="9.119">this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="2626.19" dur="8.2">we also see the New York Fed the plunge</text>

  <text start="2673.4" dur="9.03">the financial system they are getting</text>
  <text start="2677.72" dur="6.72">prepared for a major cyber attack maybe</text>

  <text start="2712.16" dur="6.78">is completely falling apart and we see</text>
  <text start="2716.06" dur="6.21">that the pentagon right now is drafting</text>
  <text start="2718.94" dur="8.07">thousands of cyber forces in prep for a</text>
  <text start="2722.27" dur="8.94">cyber emergency because as you know once</text>
  <text start="2727.01" dur="7.349">we get into war it&amp;#39;s not just gonna be a</text>
  <text start="2731.21" dur="7.5">physical war it&amp;#39;s going to be a cyber</text>
  <text start="2734.359" dur="6.811">war and they know this they know once</text>
  <text start="2738.71" dur="4.44">they provoke this war there will be</text>
  <text start="2741.17" dur="4.8">physical attacks here in the United</text>
  <text start="2743.15" dur="4.11">States because again those players that</text>
  <text start="2745.97" dur="3.47">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="2747.26" dur="3.839">bankers are picking on are</text>
  <text start="2749.44" dur="3.22">nuclear-powered they have ballistic</text>

  <text start="2754.49" dur="6.72">silently and launch the missiles from</text>
  <text start="2757.88" dur="6.479">right outside of the borders so we</text>
  <text start="2761.21" dur="5.909">realize that yes there will be physical</text>
  <text start="2764.359" dur="4.861">attacks but there also be cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="2767.119" dur="8.011">which could which eventually could shut</text>

  <text start="2787.88" dur="6.479">don&amp;#39;t have the ability to wage this war</text>
  <text start="2791.38" dur="8.27">but the central bankers once again they</text>
  <text start="2794.359" dur="7.181">really don&amp;#39;t care because they realize</text>
  <text start="2799.65" dur="5.13">this system is crumbling apart they</text>
  <text start="2801.54" dur="5.04">realize they want to restored it after</text>
