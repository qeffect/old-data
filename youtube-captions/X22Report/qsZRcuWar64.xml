  <text start="182.79" dur="6.419">are against the government and we have</text>
  <text start="185.67" dur="6.239">to remember the Constitution the Bill of</text>
  <text start="189.209" dur="6.211">Rights they were designed specifically</text>
  <text start="191.909" dur="5.071">to speak out against the government to</text>
  <text start="195.42" dur="3.629">keep the government in check with</text>
  <text start="196.98" dur="4.08">freedom of the press with the right to</text>

  <text start="211.739" dur="7.08">people you can be and you will be</text>
  <text start="214.2" dur="6.509">replaced all of this was designed to</text>
  <text start="218.819" dur="5.04">keep the government from doing what</text>
  <text start="220.709" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re doing and that is going after</text>
  <text start="223.859" dur="4.74">people that speak out against them and</text>
  <text start="225.299" dur="6.241">we can see from other countries that the</text>
  <text start="228.599" dur="6.95">u.s. government is in line with that as</text>
  <text start="231.54" dur="6.8">part of NATO we see that they push</text>
  <text start="235.549" dur="5.68">dictatorship in their country they stop</text>
  <text start="238.34" dur="6.28">freedom of speech freedom of the press</text>
  <text start="241.229" dur="5.701">and without these rights without the</text>
  <text start="244.62" dur="7.17">Constitution they would do the same</text>
  <text start="246.93" dur="9.089">exact thing here now in Afghanistan we</text>
  <text start="251.79" dur="6.749">realize that the u.s. NATO UK they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="256.019" dur="4.47">never going to leave this area they keep</text>
  <text start="258.539" dur="5.281">talking about it then we hear they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="260.489" dur="7.731">gonna bring more troops in and we see</text>
  <text start="263.82" dur="7.83">that the partially trained UK troops</text>
  <text start="268.22" dur="6.52">they&amp;#39;re completely a mess the Afghan</text>
  <text start="271.65" dur="5.91">National Army is now wracked with</text>
  <text start="274.74" dur="7.59">recruitment and equipment woes there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.56" dur="6.329">corruption it&amp;#39;s absolutely awful there</text>
  <text start="282.33" dur="4.29">was a report that was done that found</text>
  <text start="283.889" dur="5.481">the Army&amp;#39;s badly depleted and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="286.62" dur="5.4">phenomenon called ghost soldiering</text>
  <text start="289.37" dur="4.359">wherein a person is officially on active</text>
  <text start="292.02" dur="3.22">service but not actually present in the</text>
  <text start="293.729" dur="3.22">military</text>
  <text start="295.24" dur="3.42">and we see right now that these</text>
  <text start="296.949" dur="4.021">countries and NATO the United States</text>
  <text start="298.66" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re all making the case of why they</text>
  <text start="300.97" dur="6.449">need to stay in Afghanistan and we have</text>
  <text start="303.46" dur="6.929">to remember they were never leaving they</text>
  <text start="307.419" dur="5.071">were always going to stay in this area</text>
  <text start="310.389" dur="3.9">the only reason Obama came out at the</text>
  <text start="312.49" dur="4.14">time saying that we&amp;#39;re gonna be bringing</text>
  <text start="314.289" dur="4.081">our troops home is because President</text>
  <text start="316.63" dur="4.379">Karzai wouldn&amp;#39;t sign the bilateral</text>
  <text start="318.37" dur="5.609">security agreement at the time which</text>
  <text start="321.009" dur="4.53">basically allows the soldiers to stay in</text>
  <text start="323.979" dur="5.131">there and they&amp;#39;re not held liable for</text>
  <text start="325.539" dur="6.921">what happens in the country and once</text>
  <text start="329.11" dur="8.429">Karzai&amp;#39;s term came up john kerry came in</text>
  <text start="332.46" dur="7.51">they he helped elect the person they</text>
  <text start="337.539" dur="5.25">wanted in power and as soon as he was</text>
  <text start="339.97" dur="4.53">elected they signed the bilateral</text>
  <text start="342.789" dur="3.481">security agreement and soldiers were</text>
  <text start="344.5" dur="4.009">allowed to stay there and now we see</text>
  <text start="346.27" dur="5.489">everything&amp;#39;s being ramped up once again</text>
  <text start="348.509" dur="6.28">now Joe Biden is visiting Israel right</text>
  <text start="351.759" dur="5.071">now he&amp;#39;s meeting with Netanyahu and it</text>
  <text start="354.789" dur="9.81">just so happens there was a terrorist</text>
  <text start="356.83" dur="11.91">attack exactly where he was his wife was</text>
  <text start="364.599" dur="7.471">his grandchildren were and we can see</text>
  <text start="368.74" dur="6.75">already that this is most likely a false</text>
  <text start="372.07" dur="6.27">flag set up in Israel to blame on the</text>
  <text start="375.49" dur="5.25">Palestinians now of course Biden came</text>
  <text start="378.34" dur="4.23">out and said that he condemns the</text>
  <text start="380.74" dur="4.44">Palestinian leaders in wake of the</text>
  <text start="382.57" dur="4.83">terrorist attacks Netanyahu is out there</text>
  <text start="385.18" dur="5.16">criticizing the Palestinian Authority</text>
  <text start="387.4" dur="5.04">for not condemning the attacks and we</text>
  <text start="390.34" dur="5.19">can see that this is a build-up to go</text>
  <text start="392.44" dur="5.129">back into this area and this is what</text>
  <text start="395.53" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;ve been pushing for all along now</text>
  <text start="397.569" dur="7.051">out in Iran we understand back in July</text>
  <text start="400.09" dur="7.41">14th of 2015 we had the p5 plus 1 agree</text>
  <text start="404.62" dur="5.699">to this new deal and that was between</text>
  <text start="407.5" dur="7.62">China France Russia United Kingdom the</text>
  <text start="410.319" dur="9.241">US Germany and they signed the nuclear</text>
  <text start="415.12" dur="6.09">activities agreement and the u.s. lifted</text>
  <text start="419.56" dur="5.13">sanctions and we knew this is not we</text>
  <text start="421.21" dur="5.75">knew this was not about nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="424.69" dur="4.469">or nuclear reactors this was about</text>
  <text start="426.96" dur="6.609">placing the dollar on</text>
  <text start="429.159" dur="6.87">the oil that Iran is selling and Iran</text>
  <text start="433.569" dur="3.63">already notified that they are not going</text>
  <text start="436.029" dur="3.301">to do this they&amp;#39;re going to be using the</text>
  <text start="437.199" dur="4.56">euro and most likely this is temporary</text>
  <text start="439.33" dur="7.139">they&amp;#39;ll probably move to the yuan or</text>
  <text start="441.759" dur="7.41">ruble but the national emergency with</text>
  <text start="446.469" dur="8.28">respect to Iran was declared back in</text>
  <text start="449.169" dur="10.411">March 15th of 1995 and Obama reinstated</text>
  <text start="454.749" dur="6.42">it and it&amp;#39;s going to continue on beyond</text>
  <text start="459.58" dur="5.849">March 15th</text>
  <text start="461.169" dur="7.8">of 2016 so we can see nothing has really</text>
  <text start="465.429" dur="8.28">changed they&amp;#39;re not getting what they</text>
  <text start="468.969" dur="8.76">thought and the prize going through</text>
  <text start="473.709" dur="7.17">Syria is to get Iran because remember</text>
  <text start="477.729" dur="5.34">back in 2008 they made this entire plan</text>
  <text start="480.879" dur="4.29">to go throughout the Middle East conquer</text>
  <text start="483.069" dur="3.81">each one of the countries replace them</text>
  <text start="485.169" dur="4.35">with a puppet government and they were</text>
  <text start="486.879" dur="6.09">going to end with Iran they are still</text>
  <text start="489.519" dur="7.62">doing the same thing the goal has not</text>
  <text start="492.969" dur="7.891">changed now out in Yemen we see things</text>
  <text start="497.139" dur="6.15">are falling apart for Saudi Arabia the</text>
  <text start="500.86" dur="5.19">Blackwater mercenaries are a complete</text>
  <text start="503.289" dur="5.55">mess so they&amp;#39;re getting rid of the</text>
  <text start="506.05" dur="5.94">Blackwater mercenaries and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="508.839" dur="6.901">bringing in a new mercenary group called</text>
  <text start="511.99" dur="5.519">Dyna Corp and this was a contract worth</text>
  <text start="515.74" dur="5.159">three billion between the United Arab</text>
  <text start="517.509" dur="7.611">Emirates and Dyna Corp and they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="520.899" dur="10.37">going and they&amp;#39;ll be deployed into Yemen</text>
  <text start="525.12" dur="9.04">to fight the Houthis so the fight is on</text>
  <text start="531.269" dur="5.411">they&amp;#39;re just switching it up and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="534.16" dur="3.409">hoping that these mercenaries will do</text>
  <text start="536.68" dur="4.38">the trick</text>
  <text start="537.569" dur="5.801">most likely not because the paid</text>
  <text start="541.06" dur="5.55">mercenaries are being paid to fight the</text>
  <text start="543.37" dur="7.709">Houthis are fighting for their country</text>
  <text start="546.61" dur="9.36">their way of life and that always has an</text>
  <text start="551.079" dur="8.791">edge over the paid soldier we see that</text>
  <text start="555.97" dur="5.81">turkey is blackmailing the EU they first</text>
  <text start="559.87" dur="5.9">wanted three billion</text>
  <text start="561.78" dur="5.94">now they&amp;#39;re up to six billion to help</text>
  <text start="565.77" dur="5.85">reduce the influx of refugees to Europe</text>
  <text start="567.72" dur="8.22">and all of this was a complete set up</text>
  <text start="571.62" dur="7.55">from the beginning all of it was done to</text>
  <text start="575.94" dur="8.31">get all these European countries</text>
  <text start="579.17" dur="7.84">involved in Syria they wanted the</text>
  <text start="584.25" dur="6.03">Schengen gone they wanted each country</text>
  <text start="587.01" dur="5.93">to set up borders so they could stop the</text>
  <text start="590.28" dur="5.34">flight of capital between the countries</text>
  <text start="592.94" dur="5.71">because the entire economic system is</text>
  <text start="595.62" dur="5.4">completely falling apart and we see that</text>
  <text start="598.65" dur="5.7">turkey was holding all of these refugees</text>
  <text start="601.02" dur="5.19">and they were doing it because they</text>
  <text start="604.35" dur="4.8">needed funds they need more funds now</text>
  <text start="606.21" dur="5.37">because their income from the Islamic</text>
  <text start="609.15" dur="7.29">state delivering oil into Turkey has</text>
  <text start="611.58" dur="12.15">dried up we see right now that ukrainian</text>
  <text start="616.44" dur="10.71">President poroshenko is working with her</text>
  <text start="623.73" dur="5.94">one to step up efforts to protect the</text>
  <text start="627.15" dur="7.52">Crimean Tartars in the russian-occupied</text>

  <text start="639.21" dur="6.09">they are looking to join forces and they</text>
  <text start="643.11" dur="5.64">want to control what&amp;#39;s happening in the</text>
  <text start="645.3" dur="7.23">Black Sea and we can see this is all</text>
  <text start="648.75" dur="7.89">being prepared for war each step they</text>
  <text start="652.53" dur="11.07">take every military asset they move</text>
  <text start="656.64" dur="8.73">every soldier they bring in is all part</text>
  <text start="663.6" dur="4.83">of the same thing and we have been</text>
  <text start="665.37" dur="5.64">seeing and tracking all of this since</text>
  <text start="668.43" dur="4.11">the beginning remember I know everyone</text>
  <text start="671.01" dur="5.1">thinks that the economic collapse is</text>
  <text start="672.54" dur="5.84">going to happen tomorrow the next day it</text>
  <text start="676.11" dur="6.39">should it happened a couple weeks ago</text>
  <text start="678.38" dur="8.34">but remember who&amp;#39;s running this remember</text>
  <text start="682.5" dur="7.17">their plan remember what they want to do</text>
  <text start="686.72" dur="6.97">they&amp;#39;re controlling everything they</text>
  <text start="689.67" dur="5.85">controlled it back in 1929 they&amp;#39;re doing</text>

  <text start="699.36" dur="3.78">place</text>
  <text start="699.84" dur="5.94">everything is positioned and this is why</text>
  <text start="703.14" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re taking this time from 2008 until</text>
  <text start="705.78" dur="4.17">now to get this done and this is what</text>

  <text start="758.31" dur="6.09">the air there&amp;#39;s a ceasefire but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="761.85" dur="4.95">staying very quiet because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="764.4" dur="6.09">planning on something very big to happen</text>
  <text start="766.8" dur="11.61">and they want it to be a surprise when</text>
  <text start="770.49" dur="11.85">it does we see a watchdog group has been</text>
  <text start="778.41" dur="5.94">reporting that well the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="782.34" dur="5.73">over the 18 months in Iraq and Syria</text>
  <text start="784.35" dur="8.73">they didn&amp;#39;t kill 21 civilians they</text>
  <text start="788.07" dur="8.4">killed a thousand civilians 50 times</text>
  <text start="793.08" dur="6.33">more than the Coalition even admits and</text>
  <text start="796.47" dur="8.49">this is coming from a watchdog report</text>
  <text start="799.41" dur="7.26">which was issued today we see the US</text>
  <text start="804.96" dur="5.52">generals are out there saying that Libya</text>
  <text start="806.67" dur="6.99">is a failed state and of course Iran is</text>
  <text start="810.48" dur="7.07">a long-term threat the US is currently</text>
  <text start="813.66" dur="7.08">engaged right now in planning and</text>
  <text start="817.55" dur="10.81">intelligence sharing with European</text>
  <text start="820.74" dur="9.719">allies for the major offensive in Libya</text>
  <text start="828.36" dur="5.37">now they want a national unity</text>
  <text start="830.459" dur="4.461">government they&amp;#39;re pushing this idea and</text>
  <text start="833.73" dur="3.63">if they don&amp;#39;t get it</text>
  <text start="834.92" dur="4.389">they&amp;#39;re gonna go in anyhow but they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="837.36" dur="5.669">rather have the unity government now</text>
  <text start="839.309" dur="7.37">during this ceasefire with Syria NATO is</text>
  <text start="843.029" dur="7.65">out there saying that while we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="846.679" dur="6.731">countering the terrorist groups we</text>
  <text start="850.679" dur="5.97">should also provide a counter to Russia</text>
  <text start="853.41" dur="6.389">within the region because of Russian</text>
  <text start="856.649" dur="8.6">aggression and they need a strategic</text>
  <text start="859.799" dur="8.91">counter to Russia as their aggression</text>
  <text start="865.249" dur="6.611">increases which is completely ridiculous</text>
  <text start="868.709" dur="6.42">because Russia is in Syria at the</text>
  <text start="871.86" dur="6.509">request of President Assad to fight the</text>
  <text start="875.129" dur="6.481">terrorist group that the United States</text>
  <text start="878.369" dur="7.851">NATO the UK Israel and the coalition</text>
  <text start="881.61" dur="8.389">forces put into Syria to overthrow Assad</text>
  <text start="886.22" dur="7.059">so they&amp;#39;re always talking in circles</text>
  <text start="889.999" dur="7.9">because their main goal their directive</text>
  <text start="893.279" dur="9.39">is to start war any way they possibly</text>
  <text start="897.899" dur="5.79">can now we see that the u.s. it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="902.669" dur="2.61">over the corporate media and whenever</text>
  <text start="903.689" dur="3.3">you see something all over the corporate</text>
  <text start="905.279" dur="3.81">media you know this is complete</text>
  <text start="906.989" dur="5.79">propaganda it&amp;#39;s not the full story</text>
  <text start="909.089" dur="6.631">they&amp;#39;re talking about how they found the</text>
  <text start="912.779" dur="6.87">chemical weapons labs that the Islamic</text>
  <text start="915.72" dur="5.699">state was using that they bombed it they</text>
  <text start="919.649" dur="3.98">destroyed it and what we can see right</text>
  <text start="921.419" dur="4.441">now is the u.s. is going in because</text>
  <text start="923.629" dur="4.601">what&amp;#39;s happening here is the Islamic</text>
  <text start="925.86" dur="3.329">state is losing their footing in Iraq</text>
  <text start="928.23" dur="3.149">and in Syria</text>
  <text start="929.189" dur="5.4">and the u.s. is coming in and destroying</text>
  <text start="931.379" dur="4.31">all evidence of what was happening in</text>
  <text start="934.589" dur="4.74">this area</text>
  <text start="935.689" dur="5.71">remember the u.s. supports the proxy</text>
  <text start="939.329" dur="5.7">army who&amp;#39;s been using the chemical</text>
  <text start="941.399" dur="7.201">weapons in Iraq and Syria and now they</text>
  <text start="945.029" dur="5.28">need to cover up what is going on we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="948.6" dur="3.12">getting reports that the US Central</text>
  <text start="950.309" dur="5.06">Intelligence Agency and the Turkish</text>
  <text start="951.72" dur="7.77">intelligence service wif are jointly</text>
  <text start="955.369" dur="5.53">operating together to create the secret</text>

  <text start="965.41" dur="5.7">next offensive and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="968.259" dur="7.11">watch that situation very very carefully</text>
  <text start="971.11" dur="7.62">now centcom&amp;#39;s Austin he is in front of</text>
  <text start="975.369" dur="5.43">the Senate Armed Services Committee and</text>
  <text start="978.73" dur="3.959">this is Army general Lloyd Austin the</text>
  <text start="980.799" dur="7.2">third he&amp;#39;s saying that the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="982.689" dur="9.12">is spreading across the Middle East into</text>
  <text start="987.999" dur="6.21">Asia into Russia and it&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="991.809" dur="5.851">because of Russia and what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="994.209" dur="5.24">there completely irresponsible and what</text>
  <text start="997.66" dur="3.839">they&amp;#39;re really saying is that Russia is</text>
  <text start="999.449" dur="4.591">actually fighting the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1001.499" dur="7.5">where the US was actually supporting the</text>
  <text start="1004.04" dur="9.279">Islamic state so on Sunday Kerry is</text>
  <text start="1008.999" dur="6.471">going to be meeting with French German</text>
  <text start="1013.319" dur="5.791">British and Italian counterparts in</text>
  <text start="1015.47" dur="6.479">Paris to discuss the Syrian crisis ahead</text>
  <text start="1019.11" dur="4.969">of the planned peace talks in Geneva and</text>
  <text start="1021.949" dur="4.901">most likely they&amp;#39;ll be talking about</text>
  <text start="1024.079" dur="6.401">what else they&amp;#39;re going to do to get rid</text>
  <text start="1026.85" dur="5.64">of Assad not about peace how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1030.48" dur="4.349">going to approach getting rid of Assad</text>
  <text start="1032.49" dur="4.169">they&amp;#39;ll use the Geneva talks to have</text>
  <text start="1034.829" dur="4.59">them step down they&amp;#39;ll do whatever they</text>
  <text start="1036.659" dur="6.361">possibly can to reach that goal and</text>
  <text start="1039.419" dur="7.53">remember if the elections don&amp;#39;t go the</text>
  <text start="1043.02" dur="5.519">way they want it to go this is when we</text>
  <text start="1046.949" dur="3.811">see the major offensive and I think at</text>
  <text start="1048.539" dur="6.031">this point as we can see from the past</text>
  <text start="1050.76" dur="6.6">as we can see how Assad and Putin are</text>
  <text start="1054.57" dur="5.729">actually liberating cities towns and the</text>
  <text start="1057.36" dur="5.58">people are coming back saying okay this</text>
  <text start="1060.299" dur="4.98">is a good thing and life is returning a</text>
  <text start="1062.94" dur="3.209">little bit back to normal in Syria that</text>
  <text start="1065.279" dur="4.951">people are going to look at the</text>
  <text start="1066.149" dur="6.541">situation and vote for the present</text>
  <text start="1070.23" dur="5.579">government it&amp;#39;s not going to go the way</text>
  <text start="1072.69" dur="4.65">the US wants unless they come in or try</text>
  <text start="1075.809" dur="3.631">to fix it like they&amp;#39;ve been trying to do</text>
  <text start="1077.34" dur="5.49">because they want all Syrians without</text>
  <text start="1079.44" dur="6.51">proof to vote in this election and we</text>
  <text start="1082.83" dur="6.66">know why they want this to happen now</text>
  <text start="1085.95" dur="6.66">the Pentagon wants to try once again to</text>
  <text start="1089.49" dur="6.299">equip and train the Free Syrian Army to</text>
  <text start="1092.61" dur="5.46">go into Syria now they did this before</text>
  <text start="1095.789" dur="5.37">remember what they did they trained a</text>
  <text start="1098.07" dur="4.559">couple of men and it completely failed</text>
  <text start="1101.159" dur="3.811">because most of the funds and the most</text>
  <text start="1102.629" dur="6.11">of the training was going in to the</text>
  <text start="1104.97" dur="8.819">Islamic state in Turkey in Qatar in</text>
  <text start="1108.739" dur="7.961">Jordan and they had them basically</text>
  <text start="1113.789" dur="4.86">filter right into Syria that whole</text>
  <text start="1116.7" dur="5.01">training program was a complete</text>
  <text start="1118.649" dur="5.52">distraction because their real army was</text>
  <text start="1121.71" dur="6.63">the Islamic state was Al Qaeda was Al</text>
  <text start="1124.169" dur="7.95">nusra now we see a lot of propaganda out</text>
  <text start="1128.34" dur="6.959">there where North Korea is claiming to</text>
  <text start="1132.119" dur="5.13">have a miniaturized nuclear warhead and</text>
  <text start="1135.299" dur="3.781">again this is splattered all over the</text>
  <text start="1137.249" dur="4.11">corporate media and everywhere because</text>
  <text start="1139.08" dur="4.709">they need this type of information out</text>
  <text start="1141.359" dur="4.68">there to make everyone understand who</text>
  <text start="1143.789" dur="3.781">the enemies are going to be and when the</text>
  <text start="1146.039" dur="4.23">event occurs and I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="1147.57" dur="4.65">false flag event occurs you need to know</text>
  <text start="1150.269" dur="3.09">that these are the countries that did it</text>
  <text start="1152.22" dur="3.5">even though it&amp;#39;s going to be an inside</text>
  <text start="1153.359" dur="4.65">job to be blamed on these countries so</text>
  <text start="1155.72" dur="4.36">they&amp;#39;re continually making sure that</text>
  <text start="1158.009" dur="5.431">everyone knows it&amp;#39;s China it&amp;#39;s North</text>
  <text start="1160.08" dur="8.159">Korea it&amp;#39;s Russia it&amp;#39;s Iran it&amp;#39;s Syria</text>
  <text start="1163.44" dur="8.659">and today we hear the NSA chief he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1168.239" dur="6.51">come out and he&amp;#39;s giving this warning</text>
  <text start="1172.099" dur="4.721">about the black energy attack now</text>
  <text start="1174.749" dur="5.701">remember a couple weeks ago or maybe it</text>
  <text start="1176.82" dur="7.38">was a month or two already Ukraine was</text>
  <text start="1180.45" dur="5.909">attacked and their power grid went down</text>
  <text start="1184.2" dur="5.88">so they confirmed it was a cyber attack</text>
  <text start="1186.359" dur="6.361">and back then I said this was a test to</text>
  <text start="1190.08" dur="7.11">see if they were able to do it using</text>
  <text start="1192.72" dur="9.209">malware so this black energy malware was</text>
  <text start="1197.19" dur="6.959">around since 2007 and many people have</text>
  <text start="1201.929" dur="4.92">this malware at this point but this was</text>
  <text start="1204.149" dur="6.24">developed in Russia and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1206.849" dur="6.18">use it to blame on Russia and Admiral</text>
  <text start="1210.389" dur="4.71">Michael Rogers the u.s. Navy commander</text>
  <text start="1213.029" dur="4.53">US Cyber Command director National</text>
  <text start="1215.099" dur="4.741">Security Agency chief has made the</text>
  <text start="1217.559" dur="4.141">following warnings and predictions that</text>
  <text start="1219.84" dur="4.319">come from having access to the most</text>
  <text start="1221.7" dur="4.109">detailed information available and he</text>
  <text start="1224.159" dur="5.521">states clearly that it&amp;#39;s only a matter</text>
  <text start="1225.809" dur="10.621">of when not if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1229.68" dur="8.94">to see a group or actor a country engage</text>
  <text start="1236.43" dur="3.45">in destructive behavior against critical</text>
  <text start="1238.62" dur="4.62">infrastructure in the United States</text>
  <text start="1239.88" dur="5.43">remember back when Janet Napolitano was</text>
  <text start="1243.24" dur="6.6">head of DHS when she was leaving office</text>
  <text start="1245.31" dur="7.23">she said it&amp;#39;s not if but when we are</text>
  <text start="1249.84" dur="5.49">cyberattacks so they&amp;#39;re still using the</text>
  <text start="1252.54" dur="12.14">same meme at this point and we can see</text>
  <text start="1255.33" dur="13.11">that he is saying that when this occurs</text>
  <text start="1264.68" dur="7.45">it will completely bring down the power</text>
  <text start="1268.44" dur="7.14">grid and he&amp;#39;s not only concerned about</text>
  <text start="1272.13" dur="8.01">the power grid he&amp;#39;s concerned about data</text>
  <text start="1275.58" dur="8.58">theft specifically on the financial</text>
  <text start="1280.14" dur="7.32">institutions because he&amp;#39;s saying when</text>
  <text start="1284.16" dur="6.63">this happens the numbers that you see on</text>
  <text start="1287.46" dur="5.37">the screen might not show the true</text>
  <text start="1290.79" dur="3.93">picture of what&amp;#39;s really happening in</text>
  <text start="1292.83" dur="3.93">your account or the financial</text>
  <text start="1294.72" dur="3.81">institutions the numbers they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1296.76" dur="4.08">might not be real so what he&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1298.53" dur="3.54">saying is if you see that you have a</text>
  <text start="1300.84" dur="3.63">thousand dollars in the account</text>
  <text start="1302.07" dur="5.79">well those thousand dollars might be</text>
  <text start="1304.47" dur="6.66">gone siphoned off someplace else but</text>
  <text start="1307.86" dur="6.54">you&amp;#39;re still being shown a thousand so</text>
  <text start="1311.13" dur="6.39">what this tells me is this has been</text>
  <text start="1314.4" dur="6.27">planned this has been tested just like</text>
  <text start="1317.52" dur="5.43">back in August of 2003 where they had</text>
  <text start="1320.67" dur="4.44">the East Coast power go down that was a</text>
  <text start="1322.95" dur="5.66">test because they wanted to see if they</text>
  <text start="1325.11" dur="5.64">could do it they used it in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="1328.61" dur="4.69">specifically black energy to make sure</text>
  <text start="1330.75" dur="5.27">they were able to do it there and now</text>
  <text start="1333.3" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re getting prepared and ready and</text>
  <text start="1336.02" dur="5.23">they&amp;#39;re specifically saying it&amp;#39;s not if</text>
  <text start="1338.67" dur="6.63">one because they know exactly when it is</text>
  <text start="1341.25" dur="6.3">coming and they&amp;#39;re saying that this is</text>
  <text start="1345.3" dur="4.02">not just the power grid it&amp;#39;s also going</text>
  <text start="1347.55" dur="4.26">to be on the financial institutions and</text>
  <text start="1349.32" dur="4.95">this tells us that when this economy</text>
  <text start="1351.81" dur="6.27">starts to really fall apart they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1354.27" dur="6.69">going to make it look like that this</text>
  <text start="1358.08" dur="5.4">group this country does the advanced</text>
  <text start="1360.96" dur="3.99">actors they&amp;#39;re the ones who</text>
  <text start="1363.48" dur="2.76">created this mess now are they going to</text>
  <text start="1364.95" dur="3.21">bring the power down the entire country</text>
  <text start="1366.24" dur="4.26">well no that would be kind of ridiculous</text>
  <text start="1368.16" dur="5.37">because all communication will be out so</text>
  <text start="1370.5" dur="6.69">if they do this in spots around the</text>
  <text start="1373.53" dur="7.29">country like in New York they can do it</text>
  <text start="1377.19" dur="8.82">in LA they can do it in Dallas maybe</text>
  <text start="1380.82" dur="6.51">Chicago some other places but not every</text>
  <text start="1386.01" dur="3.66">single place because they need the word</text>
  <text start="1387.33" dur="4.86">to get out they need people to</text>
  <text start="1389.67" dur="5.42">understand what is going on and most</text>
  <text start="1392.19" dur="6.33">likely this next false flag will be</text>
  <text start="1395.09" dur="7.48">integrated with physical attacks because</text>
  <text start="1398.52" dur="6.99">they really need to make this event look</text>
  <text start="1402.57" dur="5.55">like it&amp;#39;s nothing we&amp;#39;ve ever seen and it</text>
  <text start="1405.51" dur="5.15">is completely horrific because again</text>
  <text start="1408.12" dur="4.95">their plan is to bring us to war and</text>
  <text start="1410.66" dur="4.6">this is what they&amp;#39;re planning at this</text>
  <text start="1413.07" dur="4.62">point this is where they&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="1415.26" dur="6.42">towards because as this economy</text>
  <text start="1417.69" dur="7.05">continually falls apart they need to</text>
  <text start="1421.68" dur="6.69">have this type of an event to convince</text>
  <text start="1424.74" dur="5.43">the population that it&amp;#39;s time to go to</text>
  <text start="1428.37" dur="3.66">war listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
  <text start="1430.17" dur="5.21">listening be well be safe and especially</text>
