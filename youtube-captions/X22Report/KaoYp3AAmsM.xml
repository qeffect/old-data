  <text start="118.2" dur="5.61">people just a couple reports ago we</text>
  <text start="120.509" dur="6.271">talked about how they are changing the</text>
  <text start="123.81" dur="4.44">requirements of bringing in more</text>
  <text start="126.78" dur="3">subprime people they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="128.25" dur="5.34">looking at the FICO score they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="129.78" dur="6.72">up with a completely new credit</text>
  <text start="133.59" dur="5.789">system score which is not it named yet</text>

  <text start="139.379" dur="3.571">and more people to the system because</text>
  <text start="140.819" dur="4.231">this is the only way the system survives</text>
  <text start="142.95" dur="5.64">this is the only way they can pump up</text>
  <text start="145.05" dur="7.65">the bubble and if we compare what is</text>
  <text start="148.59" dur="7.08">going on to 2006-2007 right before the</text>
  <text start="152.7" dur="5.789">huge collapse of 2008 we see we are</text>
  <text start="155.67" dur="5.64">headed in the same exact direction right</text>
  <text start="158.489" dur="4.951">now auto loans the amount of auto loans</text>
  <text start="161.31" dur="4.32">that are out there and the amount of</text>
  <text start="163.44" dur="5.579">people that have subprime credit the</text>
  <text start="165.63" dur="7.41">subprime loans are about 120 9.5 billion</text>
  <text start="169.019" dur="5.371">right now in 2014 back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="173.04" dur="5.58">eight when everything completely fell</text>
  <text start="174.39" dur="9.689">apart going into 2009 it went down half</text>
  <text start="178.62" dur="9.06">of that prior to that in 2006 we were at</text>
  <text start="184.079" dur="5.97">around 132 billion so we are almost</text>
  <text start="187.68" dur="3.839">there with auto loans again and if they</text>
  <text start="190.049" dur="3.571">can get that rest of the the other</text>
  <text start="191.519" dur="7.231">people in there they&amp;#39;re going to push</text>
  <text start="193.62" dur="7.14">this bubble to the maximum and we know</text>
  <text start="198.75" dur="6.239">what happens when a bubble reaches its</text>
  <text start="200.76" dur="6.059">maximum it pops and this is just not</text>
  <text start="204.989" dur="4.381">with auto loans we see the same thing in</text>
  <text start="206.819" dur="6.57">credit cards with credit cards in the</text>
  <text start="209.37" dur="8.67">year of 20 2014 we&amp;#39;re at 20 1.2 billion</text>
  <text start="213.389" dur="9.18">prior to that in 2006 going into 2007 we</text>
  <text start="218.04" dur="7.68">were at around 26 27 billion if we look</text>
  <text start="222.569" dur="5.971">at personal loans we see the same thing</text>
  <text start="225.72" dur="6.269">right now in 2014 we&amp;#39;re at 20 6.5</text>
  <text start="228.54" dur="7.05">billion prior to that we are looking at</text>
  <text start="231.989" dur="7.741">around 28 billion or so and we have to</text>
  <text start="235.59" dur="7.47">remember we also have the student loan</text>
  <text start="239.73" dur="6.839">bubble the derivative bubble the stock</text>
  <text start="243.06" dur="6.06">market bubble and during that time 2006</text>
  <text start="246.569" dur="6.57">going into 2007 the stock market was</text>
  <text start="249.12" dur="6.57">reaching all-time new highs almost 4 of</text>
  <text start="253.139" dur="5.34">every 10 loans for autos credit cards</text>
  <text start="255.69" dur="5.849">and personal boring in the u.s. went to</text>
  <text start="258.479" dur="6.051">subprime customers during the first 11</text>
  <text start="261.539" dur="5.611">months of 2014 and its continuing</text>
  <text start="264.53" dur="4.479">according to data compiled by the wall</text>
  <text start="267.15" dur="4.859">Street Journal and by credit reporting</text>
  <text start="269.009" dur="6.091">from equifax that amounted to more than</text>
  <text start="272.009" dur="4.801">50 million consumer loans and cards</text>
  <text start="275.1" dur="4.159">totaling more than a hundred and eighty</text>
  <text start="276.81" dur="5.729">nine billion the highest level since</text>
  <text start="279.259" dur="4.841">2007 when subprime loans represented</text>
  <text start="282.539" dur="6.061">about forty-one percent of consumer</text>
  <text start="284.1" dur="8.01">lending outside of the home mortgages we</text>
  <text start="288.6" dur="6.379">are there again and its continuing and</text>
  <text start="292.11" dur="6.54">we&amp;#39;re going to go way above that number</text>
  <text start="294.979" dur="5.5">that means this entire system is going</text>
  <text start="298.65" dur="2.88">to come crashing down because we have to</text>
  <text start="300.479" dur="4.951">remember they brought in the subprime</text>
  <text start="301.53" dur="5.79">subprime people back prior to 2008 now</text>
  <text start="305.43" dur="5.79">we&amp;#39;re going after the sub sub prime</text>
  <text start="307.32" dur="6.36">those people who can&amp;#39;t even get alone</text>
  <text start="311.22" dur="4.68">with their FICO stores they&amp;#39;re creating</text>
  <text start="313.68" dur="6.39">a whole new credit system to bring these</text>
  <text start="315.9" dur="5.97">people and this is how bad it is and we</text>
  <text start="320.07" dur="4.02">can see they&amp;#39;re continually pushing this</text>
  <text start="321.87" dur="8.16">and this is why they are getting ready</text>
  <text start="324.09" dur="8.85">for this collapse I mean look DHS has</text>
  <text start="330.03" dur="5.22">been purchasing billions and billions of</text>
  <text start="332.94" dur="5.22">rounds of a mother nationalizing the</text>
  <text start="335.25" dur="5.31">police force we see Jade helm being</text>
  <text start="338.16" dur="4.14">pushed out to ten states actually it</text>
  <text start="340.56" dur="3.3">seems like it&amp;#39;s being pushed out to even</text>
  <text start="342.3" dur="3.6">more States than we&amp;#39;re being told and</text>
  <text start="343.86" dur="5.13">right now the Department of Homeland</text>

  <text start="366.09" dur="5.28">people who think that everything is fine</text>
  <text start="368.49" dur="4.14">because they&amp;#39;ve been believing the US</text>
  <text start="371.37" dur="3.9">government the central bankers that were</text>
  <text start="372.63" dur="4.83">in a recovery they are going to be</text>
  <text start="375.27" dur="4.29">shocked they will not be able to handle</text>
  <text start="377.46" dur="4.829">this we have to go back and look at the</text>
  <text start="379.56" dur="5.01">movie matrix remember the scene when</text>
  <text start="382.289" dur="3.901">they were telling Neal the truth and</text>
  <text start="384.57" dur="3.06">they said oh he&amp;#39;s going to pop the</text>
  <text start="386.19" dur="3.63">reason these popping is because he</text>
  <text start="387.63" dur="4.319">cannot believe what is going on here and</text>
  <text start="389.82" dur="4.08">he couldn&amp;#39;t handle it the same thing is</text>

  <text start="404.77" dur="4.32">mechanisms going to set in and when they</text>
  <text start="406.75" dur="5.19">realize what&amp;#39;s going on this is when</text>
  <text start="409.09" dur="7.02">people lose control and this is why the</text>

  <text start="491.44" dur="7.86">something goes down we see India right</text>

  <text start="499.3" dur="6.54">weaponized drones to control unruly</text>
  <text start="502.75" dur="6.26">crowds in the northern capital of luck</text>
  <text start="505.84" dur="7.22">now we even see here in the states where</text>
  <text start="509.01" dur="7.18">they have the use of drones and they can</text>
  <text start="513.06" dur="5.65">easily be weaponized all they have to do</text>
  <text start="516.19" dur="4.53">is attach the weapons to them and</text>
  <text start="518.71" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;ve already been experimenting with</text>
  <text start="520.72" dur="5.31">these types of drones the US government</text>
  <text start="524.5" dur="3.12">central bankers and the other</text>
  <text start="526.03" dur="3.84">governments and the private wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="527.62" dur="5.37">central bank systems they are getting</text>

  <text start="540.45" dur="9.04">we understand that Yemen and Ukraine</text>
  <text start="546.029" dur="5.921">they&amp;#39;re pretty much almost exactly the</text>
  <text start="549.49" dur="5.099">same except for one difference the</text>
  <text start="551.95" dur="4.68">United States and Ukraine wanted to oust</text>
  <text start="554.589" dur="4.381">the elected government so they were</text>
  <text start="556.63" dur="6.09">behind the people in Yemen they already</text>
  <text start="558.97" dur="6.21">had a puppet regime in there and they</text>
  <text start="562.72" dur="4.44">want to return the puppet regime to</text>
  <text start="565.18" dur="4.26">power so they&amp;#39;re not backing the people</text>
  <text start="567.16" dur="4.91">in that country and Marie harf was out</text>
  <text start="569.44" dur="5.6">there saying that no there is no</text>
  <text start="572.07" dur="5.59">parallels between the two whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="575.04" dur="5.95">she went on to explain that you well huh</text>
  <text start="577.66" dur="9.57">in Ukraine he fled the country he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="580.99" dur="8.67">a legitimate leader in Yemen the</text>
  <text start="587.23" dur="4.83">President had no other place to go so he</text>
  <text start="589.66" dur="4.369">left because of security reasons well</text>
  <text start="592.06" dur="4.11">these are both the same situations</text>
  <text start="594.029" dur="4.601">Yanukovych left for security regions</text>
  <text start="596.17" dur="5.359">reasons the President and Yemen left for</text>
  <text start="598.63" dur="6.899">security reasons because the people were</text>
  <text start="601.529" dur="5.441">protesting rioting taking back their</text>
  <text start="605.529" dur="2.911">countries except the differences in</text>
  <text start="606.97" dur="3.75">Ukraine it was backed by the United</text>
  <text start="608.44" dur="4.26">States and it was completely created</text>
  <text start="610.72" dur="6.27">they spent five billion dollars we even</text>
  <text start="612.7" dur="5.79">have a recording a Victoria Nuland</text>
  <text start="616.99" dur="4.08">planning the whole thing they already</text>
  <text start="618.49" dur="4.409">had the people picked out in Ukraine in</text>
  <text start="621.07" dur="5.579">Yemen it&amp;#39;s a different story we have the</text>
  <text start="622.899" dur="5.94">Hootie&amp;#39;s who are fighting and want their</text>
  <text start="626.649" dur="3.93">country back they want the united states</text>
  <text start="628.839" dur="4.531">government central bankers out of their</text>
  <text start="630.579" dur="5.671">country so basically it&amp;#39;s the same thing</text>
  <text start="633.37" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s just the differences the united</text>
  <text start="636.25" dur="3.99">states already had a puppet regime in</text>
  <text start="637.57" dur="4.74">yemen and they wanted one in ukraine</text>
  <text start="640.24" dur="4.56">that is the difference and of course the</text>
  <text start="642.31" dur="3.87">united states they&amp;#39;re trying to explain</text>
  <text start="644.8" dur="3.69">this all the way and they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="646.18" dur="5.31">very difficult difficult time doing this</text>
  <text start="648.49" dur="5.789">at this time now we understand that</text>
