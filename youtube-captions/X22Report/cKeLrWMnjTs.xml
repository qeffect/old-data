  <text start="140.959" dur="7.14">raising rates before and everything</text>
  <text start="143.47" dur="6.64">magically reversed why well we all know</text>
  <text start="148.099" dur="5.041">that we&amp;#39;re in this economic illusion</text>
  <text start="150.11" dur="5.64">this economy that were in right now is a</text>
  <text start="153.14" dur="5.269">central bank economy which was created</text>
  <text start="155.75" dur="4.53">by the central bankers this was back in</text>
  <text start="158.409" dur="4.101">1913 then we came off the gold standard</text>
  <text start="160.28" dur="5.86">in 71 and then</text>
  <text start="162.51" dur="6.27">were on a full petrodollar system</text>
  <text start="166.14" dur="5.519">everything was based on the oil that was</text>

  <text start="171.659" dur="7.83">only is going to last 40 to 50 years and</text>
  <text start="175.129" dur="7.991">this is why in 2008 they had a push it</text>
  <text start="179.489" dur="7.291">to the extreme cut rates start stimulus</text>
  <text start="183.12" dur="5.22">not just once but like four times maybe</text>
  <text start="186.78" dur="4.86">some hidden stimulus that we didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="188.34" dur="6.269">know about and the Fed had to save other</text>
  <text start="191.64" dur="6.659">central banks around the world because</text>
  <text start="194.609" dur="5.97">the system was never meant to last this</text>
  <text start="198.299" dur="4.921">long and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="200.579" dur="4.861">throughout the entire Obama presidency</text>
  <text start="203.22" dur="5.639">where you know unemployment was higher</text>
  <text start="205.44" dur="6.57">GDP was lower the stock market wasn&amp;#39;t as</text>
  <text start="208.859" dur="5.701">high of where it is today the mainstream</text>
  <text start="212.01" dur="4.979">media the central bank they were telling</text>
  <text start="214.56" dur="5.489">us there&amp;#39;s no recession in sight</text>
  <text start="216.989" dur="6.601">whatsoever there is absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="220.049" dur="5.28">now since Trump is president and truck</text>
  <text start="223.59" dur="3.66">reversed their plan where they were</text>
  <text start="225.329" dur="5.19">trying to raise rates to crash the</text>
  <text start="227.25" dur="5.489">system that didn&amp;#39;t work they&amp;#39;re all out</text>
  <text start="230.519" dur="4.5">there reporting the same thing that were</text>
  <text start="232.739" dur="4.86">headed towards a recession with the</text>
  <text start="235.019" dur="5.131">lowest unemployment we&amp;#39;ve ever had with</text>
  <text start="237.599" dur="4.651">the market the highest we&amp;#39;ve ever seen</text>
  <text start="240.15" dur="5.369">and GDP numbers that are out of this</text>
  <text start="242.25" dur="5.4">world now why all of a sudden would the</text>
  <text start="245.519" dur="5.211">mainstream media come out and say you</text>
  <text start="247.65" dur="6.33">know something we predict every session</text>
  <text start="250.73" dur="6.46">no this is their way to try to control</text>
  <text start="253.98" dur="7.2">the narrative period the end that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="257.19" dur="7.92">this is remember we&amp;#39;re not living in an</text>
  <text start="261.18" dur="7.859">economy that runs on its own this is a</text>
  <text start="265.11" dur="7.26">controlled economy and the mainstream</text>
  <text start="269.039" dur="6.75">media the deep state they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="272.37" dur="6.269">control this is why they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="275.789" dur="4.981">push the recession narrative through the</text>
  <text start="278.639" dur="2.911">mainstream media because this is all</text>
  <text start="280.77" dur="5.04">they have left</text>
  <text start="281.55" dur="6.51">Trump he has the ability to control the</text>
  <text start="285.81" dur="4.05">statistical numbers control the market</text>
  <text start="288.06" dur="6.329">this is what they&amp;#39;ve been doing for a</text>
  <text start="289.86" dur="5.94">very long time and yes Trump will have</text>
  <text start="294.389" dur="5.731">another rate cut</text>
  <text start="295.8" dur="8.04">yes Trump will have stimulus and yes the</text>
