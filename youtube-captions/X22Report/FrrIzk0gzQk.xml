  <text start="241.269" dur="6.271">I mean they&amp;#39;re going to try they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="244.209" dur="8.131">gonna try to spin this in some way but</text>
  <text start="247.54" dur="6.87">it&amp;#39;s going to fail now in June the</text>

  <text start="299.919" dur="7.861">three point two now remember he&amp;#39;s taking</text>
  <text start="303.28" dur="7.56">what the central bank the deep state the</text>
  <text start="307.78" dur="6.12">mainstream media created they created an</text>
  <text start="310.84" dur="5.97">economy where they were telling us that</text>
  <text start="313.9" dur="5.04">this is the best we will ever see so get</text>
  <text start="316.81" dur="4.65">used to it and the reason why they were</text>
  <text start="318.94" dur="4.979">doing this is because they were trying</text>
  <text start="321.46" dur="5.03">to bring down the United States to the</text>
  <text start="323.919" dur="4.951">level of a third-world country and</text>
  <text start="326.49" dur="5.26">remember there&amp;#39;s a lot of people that</text>
  <text start="328.87" dur="5.28">are still looking for work but with the</text>
  <text start="331.75" dur="4.53">statistical numbers Trump has the</text>
  <text start="334.15" dur="3.57">ability to make it look like just like</text>
  <text start="336.28" dur="3.419">the mainstream media the deep state and</text>
  <text start="337.72" dur="4.86">the rest have done many many times</text>
  <text start="339.699" dur="5.491">before in the past make the economy the</text>
  <text start="342.58" dur="6.41">unemployment numbers look fantastic and</text>
  <text start="345.19" dur="6.569">this is exactly what he is doing now</text>
  <text start="348.99" dur="6.429">Trump hailed the strong employment</text>
  <text start="351.759" dur="4.861">report on his way out of town today and</text>
  <text start="355.419" dur="3.09">he said the following</text>
  <text start="356.62" dur="4.41">we had great numbers this morning I</text>
  <text start="358.509" dur="4.831">think 224 thousand jobs those were</text>
  <text start="361.03" dur="4.859">really unexpectedly good and our country</text>
  <text start="363.34" dur="4.29">continues to do really well really well</text>
  <text start="365.889" dur="3.96">so we&amp;#39;re very happy about it</text>
  <text start="367.63" dur="5.43">I think we&amp;#39;re going to be breaking</text>
  <text start="369.849" dur="6.6">records and I do believe that he will be</text>
  <text start="373.06" dur="6.87">breaking a lot of records because why he</text>
  <text start="376.449" dur="5.601">has the magic one now Kamala Harris and</text>
  <text start="379.93" dur="6.03">many other Dems who are running for</text>
  <text start="382.05" dur="7.33">president they tried to hit against the</text>
  <text start="385.96" dur="5.94">economy and it&amp;#39;s continually backfiring</text>
  <text start="389.38" dur="4.289">actually Kamala Harris was out there and</text>
  <text start="391.9" dur="3.87">she claimed that people are forced to</text>
  <text start="393.669" dur="4.291">work multiple jobs yes they are</text>
  <text start="395.77" dur="4.139">and remember we talked about this many</text>
  <text start="397.96" dur="4.799">many many times before this is nothing</text>
  <text start="399.909" dur="4.26">new but when Obama was president they</text>
  <text start="402.759" dur="3.96">never really liked to mention this if</text>
  <text start="404.169" dur="5.61">you notice now they&amp;#39;re coming up with</text>
  <text start="406.719" dur="5.911">everything that we said when Obama was</text>
  <text start="409.779" dur="6.781">president because they understand they</text>
  <text start="412.63" dur="5.879">can&amp;#39;t attack the statistical numbers so</text>
  <text start="416.56" dur="3.3">they have to go about it in a way that</text>
  <text start="418.509" dur="3.361">we were going about it and talking about</text>
  <text start="419.86" dur="4.44">the alternative media that was looking</text>
  <text start="421.87" dur="2.94">at the economic numbers and saying we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="424.3" dur="3.479">wait a minute</text>
  <text start="424.81" dur="4.589">look people have one or two jobs this is</text>
  <text start="427.779" dur="3.241">manipulated because they&amp;#39;re counting one</text>
  <text start="429.399" dur="5.071">or two jobs as full-time jobs</text>
  <text start="431.02" dur="5.67">she didn&amp;#39;t go to that point where she</text>
  <text start="434.47" dur="4.71">said look they&amp;#39;re counting these jobs as</text>
  <text start="436.69" dur="5.46">full-time jobs because then it would</text>
  <text start="439.18" dur="5.43">open up a can of worms and she&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="442.15" dur="5.28">to make the point that the economy is</text>
  <text start="444.61" dur="6.15">not as great as Trump is making it seem</text>
  <text start="447.43" dur="6.15">but again the problem is is that for</text>
  <text start="450.76" dur="4.11">many many years the mainstream media the</text>
  <text start="453.58" dur="3.99">central bank the deep state</text>
  <text start="454.87" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;ve been brainwashing the American</text>
  <text start="457.57" dur="5.19">public how are they doing this well with</text>
  <text start="461.08" dur="3.21">their reporting and not reporting the</text>
  <text start="462.76" dur="3.69">truth now it&amp;#39;s starting to backfire on</text>
  <text start="464.29" dur="4.47">them because Trump can use this against</text>
  <text start="466.45" dur="4.29">them look at the stock market the stock</text>
  <text start="468.76" dur="3.96">market is doing fantastically look at</text>
  <text start="470.74" dur="4.56">the unemployment numbers they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="472.72" dur="5.16">low the economy must be doing well look</text>
  <text start="475.3" dur="4.4">at the GDP numbers they&amp;#39;re very high the</text>
  <text start="477.88" dur="5.4">economy must be doing very well</text>
  <text start="479.7" dur="7.06">everything else people don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="483.28" dur="6.33">what that is and Trump knows this and</text>
  <text start="486.76" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s working to his advantage and the</text>
  <text start="489.61" dur="4.35">mainstream media the Dems the deep state</text>
  <text start="491.62" dur="5.85">the central bank they&amp;#39;re struggling to</text>
  <text start="493.96" dur="4.74">find a way to control the narrative but</text>
  <text start="497.47" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s not going to work remember</text>
  <text start="498.7" dur="4.56">Trump is and the Patriots they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="500.86" dur="6.24">controlling everything that happens in</text>
  <text start="503.26" dur="7.83">this economy now this is coming out of</text>
  <text start="507.1" dur="6.15">finance at yahoo.com and we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="511.09" dur="5.43">word that the Fed just got the green</text>
  <text start="513.25" dur="5.7">light to cut rates now this is very</text>
  <text start="516.52" dur="4.26">interesting we know that Trump has been</text>
  <text start="518.95" dur="3.57">hitting at the Fed very very hard</text>
  <text start="520.78" dur="3.15">pointing the finger and this is all</text>
  <text start="522.52" dur="4.5">being done on purpose</text>
  <text start="523.93" dur="6.93">and now the mainstream media saying yeah</text>
  <text start="527.02" dur="5.88">the Fed is going to cut rates they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="530.86" dur="6.06">acknowledging it we already knew that</text>
  <text start="532.9" dur="5.79">this was coming why because Trump has</text>
  <text start="536.92" dur="4.46">been telling the Fed this is what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="538.69" dur="6.87">going to do and the Fed is doing exactly</text>
  <text start="541.38" dur="6.34">what the Patriots want remember the Fed</text>
  <text start="545.56" dur="3.54">at one point with the deep state the</text>
  <text start="547.72" dur="4.77">mainstream media they had a completely</text>
  <text start="549.1" dur="5.7">different plan remember back in 2018 QE</text>
  <text start="552.49" dur="5.13">even put out a post about it that they</text>
  <text start="554.8" dur="5.94">were planning to raise rates look how</text>
  <text start="557.62" dur="5.34">much has changed because they were</text>
  <text start="560.74" dur="3.65">raising rates when Trump came into</text>
  <text start="562.96" dur="5.45">office and they really put</text>
  <text start="564.39" dur="7.29">their agenda in the year 2018 and all of</text>
  <text start="568.41" dur="6.18">a sudden 2019 hit and they backed off</text>
  <text start="571.68" dur="6.93">and now they&amp;#39;re going to be going in the</text>
  <text start="574.59" dur="7.26">opposite direction that even goes for</text>
  <text start="578.61" dur="7.35">stimulus they were tightening and</text>
  <text start="581.85" dur="8.46">tightening and dumping their assets from</text>
  <text start="585.96" dur="7.56">their books and all of a sudden they</text>
  <text start="590.31" dur="5.91">stopped and now we&amp;#39;re going to see rate</text>
  <text start="593.52" dur="6.24">cuts now we&amp;#39;re going to see stimulus</text>
  <text start="596.22" dur="6.87">this is part of the plan to build the</text>
  <text start="599.76" dur="6.96">system up and to continually point the</text>
  <text start="603.09" dur="6.87">finger at the Fed Trump is right on</text>
  <text start="606.72" dur="15.81">schedule listen to what he said to</text>
  <text start="609.96" dur="15.57">reporters our country continues to do</text>
  <text start="622.53" dur="4.68">really well really really well so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="625.53" dur="4.83">very happy about it I think we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="627.21" dur="4.65">to we&amp;#39;re gonna be breaking records if we</text>
  <text start="630.36" dur="3.74">had a Fed that would lower interest</text>
  <text start="631.86" dur="4.8">rates would be like a rocket ship</text>
  <text start="634.1" dur="4.93">but we&amp;#39;re paying a lot of interest and</text>
  <text start="636.66" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s unnecessary but we don&amp;#39;t have a Fed</text>
  <text start="639.03" dur="3.75">that knows what they&amp;#39;re doing so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="640.56" dur="4.53">one of those little things but if we had</text>
  <text start="642.78" dur="4.77">a Fed that would lower rates you would</text>
  <text start="645.09" dur="5.61">have a rocket ship when Obama President</text>
  <text start="647.55" dur="5.13">Obama was here he paid close to zero</text>
  <text start="650.7" dur="4.47">interest rates I&amp;#39;m paying real interest</text>
  <text start="652.68" dur="5.76">and yet our economy is much better than</text>
  <text start="655.17" dur="6.81">it&amp;#39;s ever been from election day were</text>
  <text start="658.44" dur="5.58">over 50% increase and we&amp;#39;ve made</text>
  <text start="661.98" dur="4.77">trillions and trillions of dollars with</text>
  <text start="664.02" dur="6.24">a team trillion so we&amp;#39;re doing very well</text>
  <text start="666.75" dur="7.65">but last night was spectacular now Trump</text>
  <text start="670.26" dur="8.1">has the Fed exactly where he wants them</text>
  <text start="674.4" dur="7.26">think about this for a second if the Fed</text>
  <text start="678.36" dur="6.57">doesn&amp;#39;t do what he wants and the economy</text>
  <text start="681.66" dur="5.88">fails who&amp;#39;s to blame the Fed because</text>
  <text start="684.93" dur="5.04">Trump made the economy fantastic if the</text>
  <text start="687.54" dur="4.74">Fed would just lower rates and start</text>
