  <text start="54.82" dur="5.07">talking about Greece for quite a while</text>
  <text start="56.41" dur="7.74">we know they had the bailouts we know</text>
  <text start="59.89" dur="6.39">that their debt is increasing and of</text>
  <text start="64.15" dur="2.88">course the corporate media central banks</text>
  <text start="66.28" dur="2.97">are trying to convince us that</text>
  <text start="67.03" dur="4.769">everything is fine but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="69.25" dur="4.38">once again and we knew the problem was</text>
  <text start="71.799" dur="4.561">not solved in Greece this was just a</text>
  <text start="73.63" dur="6.059">band-aid fix actually it&amp;#39;s worse now</text>

  <text start="85.24" dur="5.37">quarter after shrinking one-point-four</text>
  <text start="88.03" dur="5.49">percent in the third quarter so Greece</text>
  <text start="90.61" dur="5.25">is not fixed at all all they did was pay</text>
  <text start="93.52" dur="6.27">off the creditors steal a lot of their</text>
  <text start="95.86" dur="7.11">assets and Greece is exactly where they</text>
  <text start="99.79" dur="5.79">were once again except that they&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="102.97" dur="4.59">little worse off and they sold off parts</text>
  <text start="105.58" dur="3.54">of their country now did any of this</text>

  <text start="115.9" dur="5.49">solved and with the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="118.81" dur="5.28">nothing will ever be solved because none</text>
  <text start="121.39" dur="5.22">of this none of this debt that they keep</text>
  <text start="124.09" dur="7.53">offloading on to the country is going to</text>
  <text start="126.61" dur="8.01">help businesses individuals it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="131.62" dur="7.47">there to put the country further and</text>
  <text start="134.62" dur="8.759">further into debt IMF&amp;#39;s Thompson he</text>
  <text start="139.09" dur="6.66">warns of renewed Greek exit fears saying</text>
  <text start="143.379" dur="7.291">that saying whatever was done at this</text>
  <text start="145.75" dur="8.04">point did not help and we see right now</text>
  <text start="150.67" dur="7.26">that the 28 billion euro loan program</text>
  <text start="153.79" dur="5.849">with the IMF expires in March but the</text>

  <text start="162.01" dur="5.809">2014</text>
  <text start="164.26" dur="8.339">and we see at this point that Greece is</text>
  <text start="167.819" dur="6.7">continually collapsing we see out in the</text>
  <text start="172.599" dur="6.601">other European countries like France</text>
  <text start="174.519" dur="7.351">Italy Germany in December we sing that</text>
  <text start="179.2" dur="8.789">in France and Italy their industrial</text>
  <text start="181.87" dur="11.88">production has fallen Germany&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="187.989" dur="8.31">production has also fallen it is fell to</text>
  <text start="193.75" dur="4.92">one-point-two percent in December and we</text>
  <text start="196.299" dur="5.731">see France their production declined by</text>
  <text start="198.67" dur="8.67">one point six percent and Italy has also</text>
  <text start="202.03" dur="7.56">dropped by 0.7% if we go out to UK we</text>
  <text start="207.34" dur="5.509">see that their industrial production has</text>
  <text start="209.59" dur="6.63">dropped by 1.1 percent we are heading</text>
  <text start="212.849" dur="7.121">towards a major collapse of the system</text>
  <text start="216.22" dur="8.549">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing now here in</text>
  <text start="219.97" dur="6.87">the states we are not seeing a collapse</text>
  <text start="224.769" dur="5.011">or recession type of scenario in every</text>
  <text start="226.84" dur="4.799">single place and we wouldn&amp;#39;t see it in</text>
  <text start="229.78" dur="4.62">every single place because there are</text>
  <text start="231.639" dur="6.331">certain areas that the central bankers</text>
  <text start="234.4" dur="6.479">the US government are using to pump up</text>
  <text start="237.97" dur="4.919">the economy in other areas they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="240.879" dur="5.01">going along for the ride and we saw this</text>
  <text start="242.889" dur="5.731">back in two thousand eight where</text>
  <text start="245.889" dur="4.74">everything was falling apart California</text>
  <text start="248.62" dur="4.649">people were leaving their homes and if</text>
  <text start="250.629" dur="6.121">you were if people remember in Florida</text>
  <text start="253.269" dur="5.161">in Miami and Fort Lauderdale building</text>
  <text start="256.75" dur="4.229">was going on like crazy cranes</text>
  <text start="258.43" dur="5.79">everywhere they were continually</text>
  <text start="260.979" dur="4.741">building you couldn&amp;#39;t hold on to a piece</text>
  <text start="264.22" dur="5.61">of real estate for more than a day or so</text>
  <text start="265.72" dur="6.78">before it was sold and when everything</text>
  <text start="269.83" dur="5.85">started to fall apart it spread like a</text>
  <text start="272.5" dur="6.69">cancer and those places that were</text>
  <text start="275.68" dur="6.06">booming they were hardest hit we are</text>
  <text start="279.19" dur="5.55">going to see the same thing it happens</text>
  <text start="281.74" dur="5.549">very quickly so if you&amp;#39;re in it area and</text>
  <text start="284.74" dur="5.07">you think everything is fine and you</text>
  <text start="287.289" dur="5.401">think housing is doing great they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="289.81" dur="6.96">building buildings and it seems like</text>
  <text start="292.69" dur="5.449">everything is okay well one day coming</text>
  <text start="296.77" dur="2.84">very very soon</text>
  <text start="298.139" dur="4.261">it&amp;#39;s going to hit your area now this is</text>
  <text start="299.61" dur="4.589">not to scare you this is not to say oh</text>
  <text start="302.4" dur="5.16">you see maybe you better get out of this</text>
  <text start="304.199" dur="6.5">area or anything like that this is a</text>
  <text start="307.56" dur="6.15">warning this is so you can get prepared</text>
  <text start="310.699" dur="7.601">so you&amp;#39;re not blindsided when this</text>
  <text start="313.71" dur="7.079">happens because the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="318.3" dur="4.019">US government are going to continually</text>
  <text start="320.789" dur="4.53">tell you that everything is fine even</text>
  <text start="322.319" dur="4.231">when it&amp;#39;s not even when things are</text>
  <text start="325.319" dur="3.12">completely falling apart and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="326.55" dur="3.72">looking around and you&amp;#39;re saying yet</text>
  <text start="328.439" dur="6.061">things are not good here they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="330.27" dur="5.519">to tell you it&amp;#39;s still okay right now</text>
  <text start="334.5" dur="4.889">the corporate media is telling us that</text>
  <text start="335.789" dur="9.68">retail sales beat expectations see how</text>
  <text start="339.389" dur="8.34">strong retail is retails rose by 0.2%</text>
  <text start="345.469" dur="7.991">higher than the estimated point one</text>
  <text start="347.729" dur="9.541">percent if you remove autos we see that</text>
  <text start="353.46" dur="8.129">in January it increased by 0.1% better</text>
  <text start="357.27" dur="7.23">than the zero estimate and when you look</text>
  <text start="361.589" dur="5.61">closely at these numbers you find</text>
  <text start="364.5" dur="5.52">something very interesting well first of</text>
  <text start="367.199" dur="4.551">all we see home furniture sales has</text>
  <text start="370.02" dur="4.919">dropped by negative point five percent</text>
  <text start="371.75" dur="5.949">Sporting Goods down by negative 2.1</text>
  <text start="374.939" dur="6.811">percent food and service drinking places</text>
  <text start="377.699" dur="7.171">down- 0.5% department stores down</text>
  <text start="381.75" dur="6.089">negative point one percent you start to</text>
  <text start="384.87" dur="7.4">realize what they did they took the</text>
  <text start="387.839" dur="8.79">numbers and they added multiple seasonal</text>
  <text start="392.27" dur="9.28">adjustments to get this data looking</text>
  <text start="396.629" dur="7.29">good now the thing about seasonally</text>
  <text start="401.55" dur="4.2">adjusted retail sales is that while they</text>
  <text start="403.919" dur="4.081">are supposed to smooth out month among</text>
  <text start="405.75" dur="4.86">changes in any given data series they</text>
  <text start="408" dur="5.039">should be virtually identical to the</text>
  <text start="410.61" dur="5.789">non-seasonal adjusted retail sales on an</text>
  <text start="413.039" dur="5.22">annual year-over-year basis after all</text>
  <text start="416.399" dur="4.92">the same seasonal adjustment that was</text>
  <text start="418.259" dur="5.4">applicable this January should be the</text>
  <text start="421.319" dur="5.13">same for last January in the January</text>
  <text start="423.659" dur="6.75">before that but what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="426.449" dur="5.461">that the seasonally adjusted sales rose</text>
  <text start="430.409" dur="2.911">by 800 million</text>
  <text start="431.91" dur="4.74">four hundred and forty nine point nine</text>
  <text start="433.32" dur="6.18">billion on an unadjusted basis retail</text>
  <text start="436.65" dur="6.87">sales actually dropped by a hundred and</text>
  <text start="439.5" dur="8.28">twelve billion that&amp;#39;s with Abby billion</text>
  <text start="443.52" dur="7.29">and we see the adjusted shows retail</text>
  <text start="447.78" dur="5.73">sales moving up the unadjusted without</text>
  <text start="450.81" dur="9.45">all the seasonally manipulation we see</text>
  <text start="453.51" dur="10.62">that it&amp;#39;s really coming down and we know</text>
  <text start="460.26" dur="8.01">the US government we know the central</text>
  <text start="464.13" dur="7.82">bank they continually manipulate the</text>
  <text start="468.27" dur="8.7">data so what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the</text>
  <text start="471.95" dur="7.57">retail sales they have gone nowhere how</text>
  <text start="476.97" dur="5.07">possibly can they when all these stores</text>
  <text start="479.52" dur="5.79">are closing people are being laid off we</text>
  <text start="482.04" dur="6.36">know that Macy&amp;#39;s is closing barnes and</text>
  <text start="485.31" dur="6.06">nobles closing more stores we know that</text>
  <text start="488.4" dur="5.22">Sears is closing stores kmart is slow</text>
  <text start="491.37" dur="5.19">closing stores Walmart is closing stores</text>
  <text start="493.62" dur="5.25">and there are many others that are</text>
  <text start="496.56" dur="6.99">closing right now and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="498.87" dur="7.38">are losing their jobs we are seeing that</text>
  <text start="503.55" dur="4.08">business inventories they have rose by</text>
  <text start="506.25" dur="5.28">point one percent month on month in</text>
  <text start="507.63" dur="7.95">December sales tumbled two-point-six</text>
  <text start="511.53" dur="7.439">percent year-over-year and what this</text>
  <text start="515.58" dur="6.3">tells us is that inventories are now up</text>
  <text start="518.969" dur="7.111">by one point seven percent while sales</text>
  <text start="521.88" dur="5.96">are down by two point four percent this</text>
  <text start="526.08" dur="3.48">is telling us there&amp;#39;s a recession and</text>
  <text start="527.84" dur="4.69">when you look at the business</text>
  <text start="529.56" dur="5.85">inventories the sales we see we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="532.53" dur="5.88">approaching that period that we saw back</text>
  <text start="535.41" dur="7.23">in two thousand eight we are more than</text>
  <text start="538.41" dur="9.3">halfway to that point and when it hit</text>
  <text start="542.64" dur="8">the top it came crumbling down and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="547.71" dur="6.72">going to see the same thing once again</text>
  <text start="550.64" dur="5.52">now we know the central bankers they are</text>
  <text start="554.43" dur="4.2">pushing negative interest rates and</text>
  <text start="556.16" dur="4.15">they&amp;#39;re using all different types of</text>
  <text start="558.63" dur="3.39">excuses of why they need the negative</text>
  <text start="560.31" dur="4.23">interest rates and they&amp;#39;re also hooking</text>
  <text start="562.02" dur="3.81">it to why we need to get rid of cash and</text>
  <text start="564.54" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="565.83" dur="5.19">make everyone understand why there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="568.02" dur="6.39">reason to have cash anymore and some of</text>
  <text start="571.02" dur="7.83">them are you know we can stop criminals</text>
  <text start="574.41" dur="6.78">we can stop the drugs we can stop pretty</text>
  <text start="578.85" dur="5.01">much all of this if we got rid of cash</text>
  <text start="581.19" dur="5.25">well can you really they&amp;#39;ll just bought</text>
  <text start="583.86" dur="6.39">her in something else but let&amp;#39;s go with</text>
  <text start="586.44" dur="5.85">that let&amp;#39;s go with this is why they want</text>
  <text start="590.25" dur="4.05">to do away with cash and they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="592.29" dur="4.32">the scare tactic because also terrorists</text>
  <text start="594.3" dur="6.42">use cash and there was this would cut</text>
  <text start="596.61" dur="6.45">down on terrorism but for negative</text>
  <text start="600.72" dur="4.89">interest rates to work what do they need</text>
  <text start="603.06" dur="6.36">to do well they need to get rid of cash</text>
  <text start="605.61" dur="7.35">I mean cash is a currency that you hold</text>
  <text start="609.42" dur="7.11">in your hands and you can keep it</text>
  <text start="612.96" dur="7.26">outside of the system it&amp;#39;s external to</text>
  <text start="616.53" dur="6.6">the bank control electro electronic</text>
  <text start="620.22" dur="5.43">money like bank balances credit remains</text>
  <text start="623.13" dur="4.32">inside the banking system and the bank</text>
  <text start="625.65" dur="6.69">the central bankers the US government</text>
  <text start="627.45" dur="7.91">can control all of this a combination of</text>
  <text start="632.34" dur="6.36">no cash and negative interest rates</text>
  <text start="635.36" dur="7.75">would be a quiet permanent version of</text>
  <text start="638.7" dur="5.91">what was done in Cyprus the negative</text>
  <text start="643.11" dur="3.48">interest rates would give banks one</text>
  <text start="644.61" dur="4.71">hundred percent control over your</text>
  <text start="646.59" dur="7.41">purchases how you use your money and</text>
  <text start="649.32" dur="6.18">your life so our way of thinking right</text>
  <text start="654" dur="4.62">now is that we put our money our</text>
  <text start="655.5" dur="6.09">currency into the bank and for the bank</text>
  <text start="658.62" dur="5.58">holding and using our currency they pay</text>
  <text start="661.59" dur="6.09">us interest because they&amp;#39;re allowing</text>
  <text start="664.2" dur="5.52">them to use our currency and we gain</text>
  <text start="667.68" dur="6.09">more currency on top of what we have</text>
  <text start="669.72" dur="7.65">there with negative interest rates while</text>
  <text start="673.77" dur="5.61">we&amp;#39;re doing the opposite for example if</text>
  <text start="677.37" dur="6.57">you have a thousand dollars in January</text>
  <text start="679.38" dur="9.24">and you put it into the bank by let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="683.94" dur="10.29">say februari or march that thousand</text>
  <text start="688.62" dur="9.7">dollars now becomes 950 because they are</text>
  <text start="694.23" dur="10.27">collecting money from you to pay</text>
  <text start="698.32" dur="9.04">for the bank so where does this money go</text>
  <text start="704.5" dur="6.51">while it goes to the bank to the</text>
  <text start="707.36" dur="7.62">government they siphon your money a</text>
  <text start="711.01" dur="7.51">little bit at a time and there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="714.98" dur="6.45">you can do about it this accomplishes</text>
  <text start="718.52" dur="8.24">several things at once it finances the</text>
  <text start="721.43" dur="10.89">government limitlessly and automatically</text>
  <text start="726.76" dur="9.13">it takes your money easily they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="732.32" dur="8.25">have to file penalty charges taxes or</text>
  <text start="735.89" dur="9.18">anything like that and it pays off the</text>
  <text start="740.57" dur="6.12">bad debt of the big banks it forces you</text>
  <text start="745.07" dur="5.22">to spend everything you got as soon as</text>
  <text start="746.69" dur="5.94">you get it otherwise it will shrink it</text>
  <text start="750.29" dur="7.08">gives the system full control over your</text>
  <text start="752.63" dur="8.52">financial life ensure this is a direct</text>
  <text start="757.37" dur="6.51">return to surf them and the only way</text>
  <text start="761.15" dur="5.82">they can push the negative interest</text>
  <text start="763.88" dur="7.47">rates to have it really be successful is</text>
  <text start="766.97" dur="6.18">to get rid of cash and it seems this is</text>
  <text start="771.35" dur="5.01">what they&amp;#39;re trying to push at this</text>
  <text start="773.15" dur="6.45">point in time because there&amp;#39;s calls all</text>
  <text start="776.36" dur="5.37">over the place now for a cashless</text>
  <text start="779.6" dur="4.23">society we already have the negative</text>
  <text start="781.73" dur="4.35">interest rates and they thought because</text>
  <text start="783.83" dur="3.54">they went negative people would be</text>
