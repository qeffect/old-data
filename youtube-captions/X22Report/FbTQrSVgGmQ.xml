  <text start="118.53" dur="5.22">Republicans and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="120.989" dur="4.77">Trump is really not a Republican he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="123.75" dur="4.89">really off by himself but he needed</text>
  <text start="125.759" dur="5.071">individuals to back him up to push this</text>
  <text start="128.64" dur="4.83">plan forward because believe me those</text>
  <text start="130.83" dur="3.69">individuals within either party would</text>
  <text start="133.47" dur="6.239">like to get rid of him</text>

  <text start="161.7" dur="4.959">both sides</text>
  <text start="162.849" dur="5.881">that&amp;#39;s what this is really about now if</text>
  <text start="166.659" dur="4.92">Trump and those Patriots in office right</text>
  <text start="168.73" dur="6.959">now can&amp;#39;t do this we&amp;#39;re in big trouble</text>
  <text start="171.579" dur="6.961">and the plan like I discussed in the</text>
  <text start="175.689" dur="6.77">other report the plan is always going to</text>
  <text start="178.54" dur="7.979">have changes the plan is never ever</text>
  <text start="182.459" dur="6.76">going to be perfect if it is fantastic</text>
  <text start="186.519" dur="4.771">I&amp;#39;ve never seen a perfect plan every</text>
  <text start="189.219" dur="5.7">time I come up with a plan I always have</text>
  <text start="191.29" dur="5.399">to make changes and if you think plans</text>
  <text start="194.919" dur="4.861">are absolutely perfect and foolproof</text>
  <text start="196.689" dur="4.86">you&amp;#39;re fooling yourself plans always</text>
  <text start="199.78" dur="6.439">have to deviate and you always have to</text>
  <text start="201.549" dur="6.66">adjust and that is a good plan because</text>
  <text start="206.219" dur="3.431">sometimes you don&amp;#39;t see other things</text>
  <text start="208.209" dur="3.661">coming and you have to adjust and</text>
  <text start="209.65" dur="6.709">counter those other things that are</text>
  <text start="211.87" dur="7.349">coming to hit you and the purpose of</text>
  <text start="216.359" dur="5.951">adjusting the plan is to make sure you</text>
  <text start="219.219" dur="5.13">hit your goal and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="222.31" dur="5.16">seeing today just because something</text>
  <text start="224.349" dur="5.371">comes up and the plan isn&amp;#39;t what you</text>
  <text start="227.47" dur="4.049">thought it was going to be and you get</text>
  <text start="229.72" dur="5.31">all emotional about it will drop that</text>
  <text start="231.519" dur="7.65">emotions no good in a plant expectations</text>
  <text start="235.03" dur="6.51">no good in the plan the plan is logical</text>
  <text start="239.169" dur="4.71">thinking whoa they just threw this at me</text>
  <text start="241.54" dur="4.5">how could how do I get around it what do</text>
  <text start="243.879" dur="4.29">I got to do to reach that goal well we</text>
  <text start="246.04" dur="4.74">might have to maneuver and use a counter</text>
  <text start="248.169" dur="5.06">plan and you always have to remember</text>
  <text start="250.78" dur="4.829">that so when we go through this today</text>
  <text start="253.229" dur="3.581">those people I&amp;#39;m is seeing it all over</text>
  <text start="255.609" dur="3.66">the forms I see it all over the place</text>
  <text start="256.81" dur="5.34">where they&amp;#39;re saying oh it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="259.269" dur="4.981">over that&amp;#39;s it cues fake that&amp;#39;s this you</text>
  <text start="262.15" dur="3.299">know the plan was never the plan and I</text>
  <text start="264.25" dur="5.49">knew this was going to happen</text>
  <text start="265.449" dur="7.44">no absolutely wrong that you&amp;#39;re thinking</text>
  <text start="269.74" dur="7.7">with emotions right there so right off</text>
  <text start="272.889" dur="8.101">the bat Trump came out and he</text>
  <text start="277.44" dur="5.77">congratulated Nancy Pelosi he tweeted</text>
  <text start="280.99" dur="3.78">out in all fairness Nancy Pelosi</text>
  <text start="283.21" dur="3.959">deserves to be chosen Speaker of the</text>
  <text start="284.77" dur="5.19">House by the Democrats if they give her</text>
  <text start="287.169" dur="5.31">a hard time perhaps we will add some</text>
  <text start="289.96" dur="5.699">Republican votes she has earned this</text>
  <text start="292.479" dur="4.031">great honor now do you think he&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="295.659" dur="3.761">saying</text>
  <text start="296.51" dur="6.86">to congratulate er or is this a setup</text>
  <text start="299.42" dur="7.32">it&amp;#39;s a setup of course let&amp;#39;s begin here</text>
  <text start="303.37" dur="6.37">now we need to go back in time a little</text>
  <text start="306.74" dur="4.68">bit and I&amp;#39;m gonna go back to post 382</text>
  <text start="309.74" dur="3.39">and the reason why I&amp;#39;m doing this is</text>
  <text start="311.42" dur="5.34">because I want to read different</text>
  <text start="313.13" dur="7.86">portions so we get an idea of what is</text>
  <text start="316.76" dur="7.52">happening here in this post it says we</text>
  <text start="320.99" dur="7.26">won&amp;#39;t Telegraph our moves to the enemy</text>
  <text start="324.28" dur="9.31">we will however light a fire to flush</text>
  <text start="328.25" dur="8.73">them out now remember on 8 Jan these</text>
  <text start="333.59" dur="8.25">posts the enemy is looking at what Q is</text>
  <text start="336.98" dur="7.2">writing sometimes it&amp;#39;s disinformation to</text>
  <text start="341.84" dur="4.23">confuse them and then they come back</text>
  <text start="344.18" dur="3.3">later and tells us yes this is</text>
  <text start="346.07" dur="5.76">disinformation and it has to be done</text>
  <text start="347.48" dur="6.6">this way post 1794 never interfere with</text>
  <text start="351.83" dur="8.04">an enemy while he&amp;#39;s in the process of</text>
  <text start="354.08" dur="8.31">destroying himself post 2397 an enemy</text>
  <text start="359.87" dur="6.77">who feels safe and in control is an</text>
  <text start="362.39" dur="7.35">enemy who is not in control and not safe</text>
  <text start="366.64" dur="5.41">so remember these from the past because</text>
  <text start="369.74" dur="8.16">as we goes forward right now it will</text>
  <text start="372.05" dur="11.97">make perfect sense so let&amp;#39;s look at this</text>

  <text start="453.349" dur="5.181">of 2017</text>
  <text start="454.43" dur="6.06">remember when Trump started the voter</text>
  <text start="458.53" dur="5.19">investigation to see if there was fraud</text>
  <text start="460.49" dur="6.329">and there were a lot of states counties</text>

  <text start="466.819" dur="4.981">to turn anything over and it looks like</text>
  <text start="468.949" dur="4.801">it was a dead end back then and it</text>
  <text start="471.8" dur="5.609">seemed like they cancelled it completely</text>
  <text start="473.75" dur="6.47">so if we go back to this post Q is</text>
  <text start="477.409" dur="5.781">telling us that they have internal comms</text>
  <text start="480.22" dur="6.46">suggesting that they&amp;#39;re preparing to</text>

  <text start="510.979" dur="4.05">it hmm</text>
  <text start="512.24" dur="5.849">I would say it&amp;#39;s a lot easier to catch</text>
