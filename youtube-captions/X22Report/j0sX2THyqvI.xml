  <text start="193.48" dur="5.85">going into this and they are looking to</text>
  <text start="196.39" dur="5.28">embrace the blockchain technology now</text>
  <text start="199.33" dur="4.86">Steve Wozniak was out there and he is</text>
  <text start="201.67" dur="4.77">comparing the blockchain to dot-com</text>
  <text start="204.19" dur="3.69">to the dot-com bubble and I think he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="206.44" dur="3.06">right there&amp;#39;s a lot of cryptocurrencies</text>
  <text start="207.88" dur="3.42">out there are thousands of them right</text>
  <text start="209.5" dur="3.42">now and most of them do absolutely</text>
  <text start="211.3" dur="4.83">nothing and if you look back when the</text>
  <text start="212.92" dur="4.92">internet was first you know evolving we</text>
  <text start="216.13" dur="3.06">had all these companies come out</text>
  <text start="217.84" dur="3.36">promising that they were gonna do all</text>
  <text start="219.19" dur="3.99">these different things and most of them</text>
  <text start="221.2" dur="4.92">were junk and I think the same thing is</text>
  <text start="223.18" dur="6.389">going to happen here where we see the</text>
  <text start="226.12" dur="7.08">entire system get reworked when</text>
  <text start="229.569" dur="6.45">blockchain 2.0 3.0 comes out just like</text>
  <text start="233.2" dur="5.94">we have the Internet today it finds its</text>
  <text start="236.019" dur="4.621">footing and it you know adapts to what</text>
  <text start="239.14" dur="2.58">we really need now there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="240.64" dur="3.15">companies out there saying they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="241.72" dur="3.51">do a lot of different things but I think</text>
  <text start="243.79" dur="3.72">what&amp;#39;s going to happen a lot of these</text>
  <text start="245.23" dur="4.2">different coins are gonna disappear and</text>
  <text start="247.51" dur="4.55">there&amp;#39;s going to be the main coins that</text>
  <text start="249.43" dur="5.339">actually do something those will remain</text>
  <text start="252.06" dur="5.95">now Steve Wozniak is one of the biggest</text>
  <text start="254.769" dur="5.131">Bitcoin bulls out there he has recently</text>
  <text start="258.01" dur="4.62">stated that he hopes Bitcoin will become</text>
  <text start="259.9" dur="5.91">the world&amp;#39;s global economy now he</text>
  <text start="262.63" dur="5.87">actually agrees with Jack Dorsey who is</text>
  <text start="265.81" dur="5.64">the founder of Twitter who says that</text>
  <text start="268.5" dur="6.46">cryptocurrency is going to be the next</text>
  <text start="271.45" dur="5.01">currency now once again we can see there</text>
  <text start="274.96" dur="3.6">are certain people saying all different</text>
  <text start="276.46" dur="3.329">things about cryptocurrency and if you</text>
  <text start="278.56" dur="2.97">want to know more about cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="279.789" dur="3.75">you want to learn about cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="281.53" dur="5.1">because I think just like the internet</text>
  <text start="283.539" dur="5.281">this is going to evolve and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="286.63" dur="5.07">to get better it&amp;#39;s going to be stronger</text>
  <text start="288.82" dur="4.17">and more institutions more companies</text>
  <text start="291.7" dur="3.21">more countries are going to be looking</text>
  <text start="292.99" dur="3.69">at it and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if</text>
  <text start="294.91" dur="4.92">this actually becomes the digital</text>
  <text start="296.68" dur="5.7">currency of the world all you need to do</text>
  <text start="299.83" dur="4.98">is go over to the X 20 to report school</text>
  <text start="302.38" dur="4.47">comm site brings you to a website you</text>
  <text start="304.81" dur="4.2">can read the website read what it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="306.85" dur="3.96">about there&amp;#39;s a school there&amp;#39;s also a</text>
  <text start="309.01" dur="4.44">trading room if you&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="310.81" dur="5.94">experiencing cryptocurrency you can go</text>

  <text start="318.55" dur="5.339">trades it&amp;#39;s an entertainment room</text>
  <text start="320.889" dur="4.441">and you can see what they do in there</text>
  <text start="323.889" dur="3.511">and everyone talks to each other within</text>
  <text start="325.33" dur="4.079">the trading room once again it is the</text>
  <text start="327.4" dur="4.68">x-22 report school.com</text>
  <text start="329.409" dur="4.5">if you want to know more here in the</text>
  <text start="332.08" dur="5.369">United States what are we seeing well</text>
  <text start="333.909" dur="6.48">we&amp;#39;re starting to see that the entire</text>
  <text start="337.449" dur="4.891">real estate market is slowly breaking</text>
  <text start="340.389" dur="3.87">down now the Fed we know they are</text>
  <text start="342.34" dur="3.689">raising rates they&amp;#39;re unwinding at the</text>
  <text start="344.259" dur="4.831">same time we saw this back in two</text>
  <text start="346.029" dur="5.371">thousand five six and seven when the Fed</text>
  <text start="349.09" dur="5.91">raised the rates things started to break</text>
  <text start="351.4" dur="6.03">apart people realize that the rates were</text>
  <text start="355" dur="4.08">going up very very quickly those people</text>
  <text start="357.43" dur="5.31">then had the adjustable rate mortgages</text>
  <text start="359.08" dur="5.07">well they just couldn&amp;#39;t lock in and they</text>
  <text start="362.74" dur="4.289">just left their houses this is what we</text>
  <text start="364.15" dur="5.34">saw in California well the same thing is</text>
  <text start="367.029" dur="5.1">happening right now not as fast because</text>
  <text start="369.49" dur="4.829">rates are very very low they can&amp;#39;t raise</text>
  <text start="372.129" dur="4.201">the rates like they did back in two</text>
  <text start="374.319" dur="3.27">thousand five six and seven because they</text>
  <text start="376.33" dur="4.109">just don&amp;#39;t have the ability they would</text>
  <text start="377.589" dur="4.26">just completely wipe out everything in a</text>
  <text start="380.439" dur="4.051">single shot so they&amp;#39;re doing it very</text>
  <text start="381.849" dur="4.021">very slowly so it&amp;#39;s not noticeable but</text>
  <text start="384.49" dur="3.03">when you really look at the housing</text>
  <text start="385.87" dur="3.9">market and you look at it very closely</text>
  <text start="387.52" dur="3.869">with a magnifying glass you can see that</text>
  <text start="389.77" dur="3.899">it&amp;#39;s completely breaking down just like</text>
  <text start="391.389" dur="4.5">we said in Prior reports existing home</text>
  <text start="393.669" dur="4.831">sales pending home sales we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="395.889" dur="4.911">that the prices of homes they are coming</text>
  <text start="398.5" dur="5.31">down and we are seeing that mortgage</text>
  <text start="400.8" dur="7.95">applications they have recorded their</text>
  <text start="403.81" dur="8.579">steepest weekly fall in over four months</text>
  <text start="408.75" dur="5.979">now this is a huge drop and why is this</text>
  <text start="412.389" dur="4.65">happening well it&amp;#39;s because interest</text>
  <text start="414.729" dur="4.231">rates are moving up which knocks a lot</text>
  <text start="417.039" dur="3.271">of people out of the market now the</text>
  <text start="418.96" dur="3.87">summer months are supposed to be</text>
  <text start="420.31" dur="6.24">incredible for real estate this summer</text>
  <text start="422.83" dur="6.54">not that great we see that the first</text>
  <text start="426.55" dur="4.53">quarter GDP well it looks like we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="429.37" dur="3.9">get that five percent that they were</text>
  <text start="431.08" dur="4.649">predicting it looks like now it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="433.27" dur="4.049">revised many many times from came down</text>
  <text start="435.729" dur="4.321">from five percent all the way down to</text>
  <text start="437.319" dur="5.13">three to two point five to two point</text>
  <text start="440.05" dur="7.01">three to two point two and here we are</text>
  <text start="442.449" dur="8.84">at two point zero right now and again</text>
  <text start="447.06" dur="5.85">most of the GDP number comes from</text>
  <text start="451.289" dur="5.071">spending</text>
  <text start="452.91" dur="6.48">70% is consumer spending and what did</text>
  <text start="456.36" dur="6.54">they see well they see that personal</text>
  <text start="459.39" dur="6.33">consumption well it was revised downward</text>
  <text start="462.9" dur="5.99">it declined from an annualized</text>
  <text start="465.72" dur="7.89">bottom-line contribution of 0.7 1% and</text>
  <text start="468.89" dur="7.48">it dropped 2.60% so what we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="473.61" dur="4.17">at right now is that personal</text>
  <text start="476.37" dur="3.12">consumption people going out there</text>
  <text start="477.78" dur="4.95">purchasing goods and things like that</text>
  <text start="479.49" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s just not happening and it shows up</text>
  <text start="482.73" dur="3.45">in retail and everything else and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="484.5" dur="3.75">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and if we</text>
  <text start="486.18" dur="4.46">look at the track record of a lent of</text>
  <text start="488.25" dur="4.65">the Atlanta Fed in the first quarter in</text>
  <text start="490.64" dur="4.12">February of this year they told us that</text>
  <text start="492.9" dur="4.53">GDP was going to be around five point</text>
  <text start="494.76" dur="6.66">three seven six percent and then they</text>
  <text start="497.43" dur="4.53">revised each time we&amp;#39;re in the end of</text>
  <text start="501.42" dur="2.22">March</text>
  <text start="501.96" dur="5.37">they were down to about three and a half</text>
  <text start="503.64" dur="5.91">percent by April they were down to two</text>
  <text start="507.33" dur="4.83">and a half percent and here we are</text>
  <text start="509.55" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re down to two percent so they</text>
  <text start="512.16" dur="4.74">start out very very high and then</text>
  <text start="514.44" dur="4.59">reality sets in and actually this number</text>
  <text start="516.9" dur="4.47">is much much lower this is the</text>
  <text start="519.03" dur="4.68">manipulated number where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="521.37" dur="3.96">throwing everything in there to pretty</text>
  <text start="523.71" dur="3.93">much try to make it look a lot better</text>
  <text start="525.33" dur="4.2">than it really is and this is the same</text>
  <text start="527.64" dur="3.45">calculation that they&amp;#39;ve been using</text>
  <text start="529.53" dur="6.18">since 2008 where they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="531.09" dur="6.24">manipulating GDP unemployment and as</text>
  <text start="535.71" dur="3.69">time goes on they manipulate it a little</text>
  <text start="537.33" dur="3.3">bit more to make it look a lot better</text>
  <text start="539.4" dur="3.66">and this is what they&amp;#39;ve been doing for</text>
  <text start="540.63" dur="5.94">a very long time so really nothing has</text>
  <text start="543.06" dur="8.12">changed whatsoever the CBO is warning</text>
  <text start="546.57" dur="7.44">that the US debt will surpass the GDP by</text>
  <text start="551.18" dur="4.84">2030 I think it&amp;#39;s going to hit here much</text>
  <text start="554.01" dur="5.22">much sooner if we continue on this track</text>
  <text start="556.02" dur="5.51">because the debt level is increasing at</text>
  <text start="559.23" dur="7.32">an exponential rate and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="561.53" dur="6.85">unbelievable compared to the GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="566.55" dur="5.25">which are completely fake phony and</text>
  <text start="568.38" dur="6.39">false anyhow and the consumer spending</text>
  <text start="571.8" dur="5.22">aspect of it that&amp;#39;s going to fall very</text>
  <text start="574.77" dur="3.93">very quickly so I think there are going</text>
  <text start="577.02" dur="3.15">to be a little off on this number I</text>
  <text start="578.7" dur="3.48">think it&amp;#39;s going to happen a lot sooner</text>
  <text start="580.17" dur="4.169">because a lot of what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="582.18" dur="3.99">around the economy right now is</text>
  <text start="584.339" dur="6.011">completely manipulated</text>
  <text start="586.17" dur="7">we also see the money supply growth it</text>
  <text start="590.35" dur="6.12">fell to a three-month low in May this</text>
  <text start="593.17" dur="6.06">year and it&amp;#39;s continuing a downward</text>
  <text start="596.47" dur="4.5">slide and we&amp;#39;re also seeing global</text>
  <text start="599.23" dur="3.81">growth decline now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="600.97" dur="6">interesting about the money supply is</text>
  <text start="603.04" dur="6.899">that we&amp;#39;ve seen this before and each</text>
  <text start="606.97" dur="8.549">time we are in a recession we have seen</text>
  <text start="609.939" dur="7.83">the m2 money supply drop decline and if</text>
  <text start="615.519" dur="5.82">we look back in time we can see it in</text>
  <text start="617.769" dur="6.99">2008 we can see it in 2001 we can see it</text>
  <text start="621.339" dur="6.961">in 95 96 we can see it going back in</text>
  <text start="624.759" dur="7.231">time here we are once again where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="628.3" dur="7.529">at the same level and if we really look</text>
  <text start="631.99" dur="5.969">at it in 2019 we&amp;#39;re going to hit the</text>
  <text start="635.829" dur="5.521">level where it says we&amp;#39;re in a recession</text>
  <text start="637.959" dur="7.17">and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of indicators</text>
  <text start="641.35" dur="5.719">right now letting us know that we are</text>
  <text start="645.129" dur="4.411">either in a recession right now or</text>
  <text start="647.069" dur="4.901">approaching a recession now another</text>
  <text start="649.54" dur="5.489">indicator is commercial and industrial</text>
  <text start="651.97" dur="5.19">loans they are declining and every time</text>
  <text start="655.029" dur="5.011">we&amp;#39;ve seen this decline guess what</text>
  <text start="657.16" dur="4.919">happens we enter a recession so when we</text>
  <text start="660.04" dur="5.31">start looking at all these economic</text>
  <text start="662.079" dur="5.55">indicators they are showing us that we</text>
  <text start="665.35" dur="4.649">are entering or we are already in a</text>
  <text start="667.629" dur="4.741">recession now remember a lot of what</text>
  <text start="669.999" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;re seeing is manipulated which means</text>
  <text start="672.37" dur="4.529">which most likely means we are already</text>
  <text start="674.709" dur="3.99">in this recession and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="676.899" dur="4.56">covering it up actually if we go back in</text>
  <text start="678.699" dur="6.36">time to 2008 we were in a recession</text>
  <text start="681.459" dur="6.031">prior to October they just didn&amp;#39;t let us</text>
  <text start="685.059" dur="4.921">know that until the market came down and</text>
  <text start="687.49" dur="5.399">even then they weren&amp;#39;t really saying</text>
  <text start="689.98" dur="4.62">recession until later on and this is</text>
  <text start="692.889" dur="4.021">what they always do they go back in time</text>
  <text start="694.6" dur="4.44">and they recalculate everything and they</text>
  <text start="696.91" dur="4.89">tell you when it started but of course</text>
  <text start="699.04" dur="5.279">at that point it&amp;#39;s too late here we are</text>
  <text start="701.8" dur="5.43">today looking at all these indicators</text>
  <text start="704.319" dur="5.01">and we can see the patterns that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="707.23" dur="4.589">we&amp;#39;re following these patterns the</text>
  <text start="709.329" dur="4.98">patterns really don&amp;#39;t change that much</text>
  <text start="711.819" dur="4.411">maybe a little bit here and there but</text>
  <text start="714.309" dur="4.2">when you look back and you see all these</text>
  <text start="716.23" dur="3.37">patterns they&amp;#39;re pretty much exactly</text>
  <text start="718.509" dur="3.611">this</text>
  <text start="719.6" dur="5.159">same the same thing with unemployment</text>
  <text start="722.12" dur="4.469">claims whenever we reach a very very low</text>
  <text start="724.759" dur="3.69">point guess what happens we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="726.589" dur="4.321">recession when we see the money supply</text>
  <text start="728.449" dur="4.5">drop down into Klein like this room</text>
  <text start="730.91" dur="5.159">earnest we&amp;#39;re in a recession when we see</text>
  <text start="732.949" dur="5.521">the Fed start to raise rates and we see</text>
  <text start="736.069" dur="4.02">the housing market break down we see the</text>
  <text start="738.47" dur="3.96">credit market break down we see</text>
  <text start="740.089" dur="5.461">commercial and industrial loans decline</text>
  <text start="742.43" dur="6">we enter a recession so all these</text>
  <text start="745.55" dur="6.269">indicators are pretty much showing us</text>
  <text start="748.43" dur="5.639">the exact same thing and if we go back</text>
  <text start="751.819" dur="5.19">in time they shown the same thing back</text>
  <text start="754.069" dur="4.621">in 2008 if we go back to 2001 they</text>
  <text start="757.009" dur="3.931">showed us the same exact thing there if</text>
  <text start="758.69" dur="5.25">we go back in time they continually show</text>
  <text start="760.94" dur="5.759">us the same exact thing so we are</text>
  <text start="763.94" dur="6.839">following the patterns the patterns hold</text>
  <text start="766.699" dur="6.87">true every single time and it shows us</text>
  <text start="770.779" dur="5.281">that we are in a recession or we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="773.569" dur="4.2">approaching a recession which means</text>
  <text start="776.06" dur="4.13">we&amp;#39;re gonna be heading into this</text>
  <text start="777.769" dur="5.641">collapse scenario because at this point</text>
  <text start="780.19" dur="6.129">forget about the recession we are headed</text>
  <text start="783.41" dur="4.65">for a collapse a transition into a new</text>
  <text start="786.319" dur="3.841">system because each time we hit the</text>
  <text start="788.06" dur="4.529">recession before well we didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="790.16" dur="3.779">this much debt we have other countries</text>
  <text start="792.589" dur="3.36">moving away from the dollar selling the</text>
  <text start="793.939" dur="3.96">Treasuries like they&amp;#39;re doing we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="795.949" dur="5.07">have this money printing that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="797.899" dur="4.86">seeing today we didn&amp;#39;t have the Fed take</text>
  <text start="801.019" dur="5.221">four and a half trillion and put it on</text>
  <text start="802.759" dur="5.52">its books we we didn&amp;#39;t have different</text>
  <text start="806.24" dur="4.649">central banks around the world going to</text>
  <text start="808.279" dur="5.071">either zero or negative interest rates</text>
  <text start="810.889" dur="6.861">we didn&amp;#39;t see this in the last</text>
  <text start="813.35" dur="8.549">recessions because when 2008 hit</text>
  <text start="817.75" dur="6.519">Congress allowed the central banks to</text>
  <text start="821.899" dur="5.401">really do whatever they needed to do to</text>
  <text start="824.269" dur="7.13">keep the system alive alive long enough</text>
  <text start="827.3" dur="6.33">for them to prepare for the collapse and</text>
  <text start="831.399" dur="4.781">that&amp;#39;s what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="833.63" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to prepare for this</text>
  <text start="836.18" dur="4.98">collapse they were going to have this</text>
  <text start="838.13" dur="5.34">whole story but this is this would be</text>
  <text start="841.16" dur="4.08">their narrative of why this whole thing</text>
  <text start="843.47" dur="4.77">was coming down they were going to play</text>
  <text start="845.24" dur="3.709">you know a war a country now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="848.24" dur="4.01">stuck</text>
  <text start="848.949" dur="6.181">they don&amp;#39;t have this narrative anymore</text>
  <text start="852.25" dur="5.52">and they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out what</text>
  <text start="855.13" dur="5.43">they need to do to try to control this</text>
  <text start="857.77" dur="4.65">and blame this on another entity most</text>
  <text start="860.56" dur="4.23">likely the Trump administration this is</text>
  <text start="862.42" dur="3.87">where they&amp;#39;ve been leaning up to and we</text>
  <text start="864.79" dur="4.05">know that the stress tests with the</text>
  <text start="866.29" dur="4.74">banks we know that most of the banks in</text>
  <text start="868.84" dur="4.17">Europe and in the u.s. they&amp;#39;re insolvent</text>
  <text start="871.03" dur="4.35">and we know that the stress tests were</text>
  <text start="873.01" dur="5.88">there to give us some type of insurance</text>
  <text start="875.38" dur="6.15">that everything was okay but we realize</text>
  <text start="878.89" dur="5.58">by looking at all this data and all this</text>
  <text start="881.53" dur="5.16">information the economy is doomed at</text>
  <text start="884.47" dur="5.01">this point there&amp;#39;s so much manipulation</text>
  <text start="886.69" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s so much covert money going all</text>
  <text start="889.48" dur="4.05">different places some people call it</text>
  <text start="890.95" dur="6">dark money and we know that this system</text>
  <text start="893.53" dur="5.4">cannot stay alive much longer and from</text>
  <text start="896.95" dur="5.22">every single indicator that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
