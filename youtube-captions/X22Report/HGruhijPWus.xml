  <text start="113.6" dur="5.22">to do away with cash now we heard all</text>
  <text start="116.659" dur="4.14">about this before there were some</text>
  <text start="118.82" dur="5.79">experiments that were done in other</text>
  <text start="120.799" dur="5.701">countries we heard different individuals</text>
  <text start="124.61" dur="3.75">saying let&amp;#39;s get rid of the</text>
  <text start="126.5" dur="4.14">hundred-dollar bill let&amp;#39;s get rid of</text>
  <text start="128.36" dur="5.34">this bill and it looks like the war on</text>
  <text start="130.64" dur="6.569">cash well it&amp;#39;s escalating right now the</text>
  <text start="133.7" dur="4.71">payment networks they want to kill cash</text>
  <text start="137.209" dur="4.021">and it looks like this is coming from</text>
  <text start="138.41" dur="4.53">like Visa MasterCard where they use the</text>
  <text start="141.23" dur="3.72">payment systems and what they want</text>
  <text start="142.94" dur="3.66">everyone to do is they want everyone to</text>
  <text start="144.95" dur="4.05">use credit card and debit cards they</text>
  <text start="146.6" dur="7.139">don&amp;#39;t want anyone to use cash now how</text>
  <text start="149" dur="8.34">are they doing this well visa they have</text>
  <text start="153.739" dur="5.671">this new offer for small merchants take</text>
  <text start="157.34" dur="3.959">thousands of dollars from the card run</text>
  <text start="159.41" dur="4.62">to upgrade their payment technology in</text>
  <text start="161.299" dur="6.571">return the businesses must stop</text>
  <text start="164.03" dur="6.51">accepting cash now the company unveiled</text>
  <text start="167.87" dur="4.98">the initiative on Wednesday as part of a</text>
  <text start="170.54" dur="6.75">broader effort to steer Americans away</text>
  <text start="172.85" dur="8.039">from using paper money so we see already</text>
  <text start="177.29" dur="5.759">that when you go into a store if they</text>
  <text start="180.889" dur="4.291">take this offer they&amp;#39;re gonna say sorry</text>
  <text start="183.049" dur="2.821">you can&amp;#39;t use cash sorry you can&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="185.18" dur="3.77">cash</text>
  <text start="185.87" dur="6.6">and as more and more stores do this</text>
  <text start="188.95" dur="5.35">people will stop using cash now there</text>
  <text start="192.47" dur="3.36">are going to be problems of course</text>
  <text start="194.3" dur="4.799">because we still have restaurants</text>
  <text start="195.83" dur="6.659">restaurants like using and accepting</text>
  <text start="199.099" dur="5.25">cash and we know right now that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="202.489" dur="4.201">waiters and waitresses they like to</text>
  <text start="204.349" dur="4.591">accept cash a lot of people that go into</text>
  <text start="206.69" dur="3.9">these establishments they like to use</text>
  <text start="208.94" dur="5.579">casual so the people are saying now with</text>
  <text start="210.59" dur="6.69">this new chip it takes way too long to</text>
  <text start="214.519" dur="4.861">you know have some type of transaction</text>
  <text start="217.28" dur="4.049">before when you just swipe the card it</text>
  <text start="219.38" dur="3.9">was much faster now it takes a very long</text>
  <text start="221.329" dur="5.25">time and there&amp;#39;s a lot more information</text>
  <text start="223.28" dur="6.81">that is transferred over to track what</text>
  <text start="226.579" dur="5.19">you&amp;#39;re actually purchasing so we can see</text>
  <text start="230.09" dur="3.6">at this point that they aren&amp;#39;t making a</text>
  <text start="231.769" dur="4.83">play for this now remember we talked</text>
  <text start="233.69" dur="6.299">about how the central bankers how they</text>
  <text start="236.599" dur="6">are trying to control the economy now</text>
  <text start="239.989" dur="4.83">they control most of it now what they</text>
  <text start="242.599" dur="5.97">really want to do is they want to</text>
  <text start="244.819" dur="7.04">control everything and when I mean</text>
  <text start="248.569" dur="6.271">everything that means they can control</text>
  <text start="251.859" dur="5.741">everything that you do they can watch</text>
  <text start="254.84" dur="5.28">everything that you can that you do they</text>
  <text start="257.6" dur="5.12">don&amp;#39;t need to spy on you because all</text>
  <text start="260.12" dur="6.81">that data will flow right into them and</text>
  <text start="262.72" dur="6.79">there&amp;#39;s nothing else you can do and we</text>
  <text start="266.93" dur="4.41">can see at this point that to move what</text>
  <text start="269.51" dur="5.37">they want to do is move away from paper</text>
  <text start="271.34" dur="6.81">currency and go into digital currency</text>
  <text start="274.88" dur="6.12">now is this such a bad thing well no not</text>
  <text start="278.15" dur="4.8">really what makes it bad is that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="281" dur="6.95">centralized from the central bank</text>
  <text start="282.95" dur="8.279">if it&amp;#39;s decentralized that&amp;#39;s okay</text>
  <text start="287.95" dur="7.96">centralization they have control over</text>
  <text start="291.229" dur="5.881">everything that you&amp;#39;re doing so this is</text>
  <text start="295.91" dur="2.97">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="297.11" dur="3.66">looking into the blockchain technology</text>
  <text start="298.88" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t get me wrong there&amp;#39;s many people</text>
  <text start="300.77" dur="4.14">out there saying well the blockchain</text>
  <text start="302.69" dur="4.38">technology it&amp;#39;s going to free us of all</text>
  <text start="304.91" dur="5.4">this well they&amp;#39;re looking at it to keep</text>
  <text start="307.07" dur="5.55">us enslaved because they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="310.31" dur="5.25">the blockchain technology within their</text>
  <text start="312.62" dur="5.49">systems then we have the decentralized</text>
  <text start="315.56" dur="4.1">blockchain system where they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="318.11" dur="4.76">any control of this so</text>
  <text start="319.66" dur="5.88">is going to be a battle between these</text>
  <text start="322.87" dur="4.98">two systems and you know what the</text>
  <text start="325.54" dur="5.04">central bank wants they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="327.85" dur="5.22">give any of this up and this is why</text>
  <text start="330.58" dur="5.24">they&amp;#39;re trying to maintain control now</text>
  <text start="333.07" dur="6.57">we already know coming out of the CBO</text>
  <text start="335.82" dur="6.22">they&amp;#39;ve looked at the entire economy and</text>
  <text start="339.64" dur="4.83">they said listen the way things are</text>
  <text start="342.04" dur="5.31">right now everything cannot be sustained</text>
  <text start="344.47" dur="5.7">and everything that Trump is trying to</text>
  <text start="347.35" dur="5.61">do well it can&amp;#39;t be sustained because</text>
  <text start="350.17" dur="5.43">the US debt is unsustainable right now</text>
  <text start="352.96" dur="6.63">and we might head into some type of</text>
  <text start="355.6" dur="6.65">financial crisis now once again we are</text>
  <text start="359.59" dur="5.61">hearing alarm bells all over the place</text>
  <text start="362.25" dur="5.47">where they&amp;#39;re flashing these warnings</text>
  <text start="365.2" dur="3.54">now we know that the Fed they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="367.72" dur="3.57">that they&amp;#39;re not going to raise interest</text>
  <text start="368.74" dur="5.04">rates they think everything is you know</text>
  <text start="371.29" dur="5.1">okay it&amp;#39;s normalizing it&amp;#39;s stabilizing</text>
  <text start="373.78" dur="4.65">right now and they&amp;#39;re going to unwind</text>
  <text start="376.39" dur="5.25">their balance sheet and I heard that</text>
  <text start="378.43" dur="5.61">Yellen well she&amp;#39;s going to make sure as</text>
  <text start="381.64" dur="4.68">she&amp;#39;s unwinding the balance sheet she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="384.04" dur="4.91">going to keep an eye on the flattening</text>
  <text start="386.32" dur="6.21">yield curve to make sure you know it</text>
  <text start="388.95" dur="6.16">stabilizes now of course as we know as</text>
  <text start="392.53" dur="4.53">they continue to do all this we know</text>
  <text start="395.11" dur="3.9">that this is going to get out of hand</text>
  <text start="397.06" dur="6.03">because we&amp;#39;ve seen this before this is</text>
  <text start="399.01" dur="6.99">nothing new if we go back to 2004 2005</text>
  <text start="403.09" dur="5.49">2006 they did the same exact thing now</text>
  <text start="406" dur="6.6">the economy was much much stronger back</text>
  <text start="408.58" dur="5.79">then actual Americans were working in</text>
  <text start="412.6" dur="4.89">the economy they were actually buying</text>
  <text start="414.37" dur="8.13">homes they were actually spending money</text>
  <text start="417.49" dur="8.88">today we don&amp;#39;t see any event the economy</text>
  <text start="422.5" dur="6.03">is a ghost economy where Americans are</text>
  <text start="426.37" dur="3.78">sitting on the sidelines what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="428.53" dur="3.42">seeing in the stock market what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="430.15" dur="4.2">seeing in the housing market what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="431.95" dur="5.64">seeing around the entire country is</text>
  <text start="434.35" dur="6.24">where the central bank has taken control</text>
  <text start="437.59" dur="5.73">and they&amp;#39;re the ones with hedge funds</text>
  <text start="440.59" dur="6.139">investment companies and others they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="443.32" dur="6.27">the ones who created this illusion</text>
  <text start="446.729" dur="4.331">remember over a hundred million people</text>
  <text start="449.59" dur="3.849">are sitting on the sidelines because</text>
  <text start="451.06" dur="4.869">they can&amp;#39;t find a job</text>
  <text start="453.439" dur="6.78">they&amp;#39;re looking they just can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="455.929" dur="5.88">work and many of these individuals which</text>
  <text start="460.219" dur="4.32">they are counted as full-time jobs</text>
  <text start="461.809" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re working part-time jobs or maybe</text>
  <text start="464.539" dur="5.1">two part-time jobs they&amp;#39;re not out</text>
  <text start="466.729" dur="6.96">buying these incredibly nice homes or</text>
  <text start="469.639" dur="6.661">any type of home this is all done by the</text>
  <text start="473.689" dur="6.03">central banks and if you look at the</text>
  <text start="476.3" dur="5.159">balance sheet of the central bank what</text>
  <text start="479.719" dur="4.56">we see is about eight hundred and thirty</text>
  <text start="481.459" dur="6.06">eight billion or forty percent of their</text>
  <text start="484.279" dur="8.25">balance sheet well that belongs to</text>
  <text start="487.519" dur="8.01">foreign banks so what we see is this</text>
  <text start="492.529" dur="4.89">system it&amp;#39;s falling apart in all</text>
  <text start="495.529" dur="4.62">different areas and many financial</text>
  <text start="497.419" dur="6">pundits many different financial</text>
  <text start="500.149" dur="5.37">institutions they&amp;#39;re out there and</text>
  <text start="503.419" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re ringing the alarm bells now</text>
  <text start="505.519" dur="6.3">let&amp;#39;s think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="507.649" dur="8.25">we had the 1999 stock bubble we had the</text>
  <text start="511.819" dur="6.931">2007 bubble and if we go back in time</text>
  <text start="515.899" dur="4.8">remember how everyone said that it</text>
  <text start="518.75" dur="3.86">really wasn&amp;#39;t that big of a bubble</text>
  <text start="520.699" dur="4.231">because stocks weren&amp;#39;t as expenses</text>
  <text start="522.61" dur="4.719">expensive as they&amp;#39;ve been during the</text>
  <text start="524.93" dur="5.19">previous bubble the tech bubble we all</text>
  <text start="527.329" dur="4.86">remember how that turned out the bubble</text>
  <text start="530.12" dur="5.579">burst leading to the greatest financial</text>
  <text start="532.189" dur="7.76">crisis in 80 years well today&amp;#39;s bubble</text>
  <text start="535.699" dur="6.661">is way larger than that of 2007 and</text>
  <text start="539.949" dur="3.76">arguing that the stocks are cheaper than</text>
  <text start="542.36" dur="4.55">they were during the tech bubble</text>
  <text start="543.709" dur="6.841">well that doesn&amp;#39;t hold water anymore and</text>
  <text start="546.91" dur="7.45">if we look at the chart we can see that</text>
  <text start="550.55" dur="7.08">the sp500 price to sales ratio called</text>
  <text start="554.36" dur="9.3">the PS ratio you can see based on this</text>
  <text start="557.63" dur="9.829">metric 2000 bubble is a mere blip we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="563.66" dur="7.5">now in a territory not seen since 1999</text>
  <text start="567.459" dur="9.25">stock market bubble we&amp;#39;re at almost at</text>
  <text start="571.16" dur="7.529">that same exact place and if we look at</text>
  <text start="576.709" dur="4.591">this we can see that earnings cash flow</text>
  <text start="578.689" dur="5.101">Book value are all financial data points</text>
  <text start="581.3" dur="4.86">that can be massaged via all different</text>
  <text start="583.79" dur="3.66">type of gimmicks that they use and as a</text>
  <text start="586.16" dur="3.12">result of this</text>
  <text start="587.45" dur="3.9">the valuing stocks based on</text>
  <text start="589.28" dur="5.13">price-to-earnings price to cashflow</text>
  <text start="591.35" dur="8.25">price to book value can often lead to</text>
  <text start="594.41" dur="11.91">inaccurate valuations one thing very</text>
  <text start="599.6" dur="9">hard to manipulate sales sales well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="606.32" dur="5.22">very hard to massage that type of data</text>
  <text start="608.6" dur="5.58">either the money came in the door or it</text>
  <text start="611.54" dur="5.73">didn&amp;#39;t and if the company has caught</text>
  <text start="614.18" dur="6.05">faking its sales number well most of the</text>
  <text start="617.27" dur="5.91">time people go to jail not all the time</text>
  <text start="620.23" dur="6.22">so the fact that stocks are now trading</text>
  <text start="623.18" dur="6.36">at a PS ratio that matches the tech</text>
  <text start="626.45" dur="6.15">bubble which is the single single</text>
  <text start="629.54" dur="6.36">largest stock bubble in history tells us</text>
  <text start="632.6" dur="5.25">that we&amp;#39;re truly trading at astronomical</text>
  <text start="635.9" dur="6.36">level levels associated with staggering</text>
  <text start="637.85" dur="6.69">levels of excess and this is not going</text>
  <text start="642.26" dur="5.22">to end well now Bank of America is out</text>
  <text start="644.54" dur="5.07">there and they&amp;#39;re saying that the most</text>
  <text start="647.48" dur="4.92">dangerous moment for markets will be</text>
  <text start="649.61" dur="5.4">when rising rates combined in three or</text>
  <text start="652.4" dur="4.98">four months time with an inflection</text>
  <text start="655.01" dur="4.92">point in corporate profits so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="657.38" dur="5.4">saying that something is going to happen</text>
  <text start="659.93" dur="4.38">three to four months from now and if you</text>
  <text start="662.78" dur="4.89">look at their chart that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="664.31" dur="5.28">presenting they show that the total</text>
  <text start="667.67" dur="5.19">amount of hours work necessary to buy a</text>
  <text start="669.59" dur="6.57">unit of the sp500 has risen to an</text>
  <text start="672.86" dur="8.79">all-time high now the last time we saw</text>
  <text start="676.16" dur="10.76">this was in 99 guess what we&amp;#39;re at the</text>
  <text start="681.65" dur="11.28">same exact point as we were back in 1999</text>
  <text start="686.92" dur="7.9">this is not going to end well now to</text>
  <text start="692.93" dur="4.77">take this a step further we know that</text>
  <text start="694.82" dur="6">other countries they are having major</text>
  <text start="697.7" dur="5.16">problems Canada for instance they just</text>
  <text start="700.82" dur="5.07">raised their rates the first time they</text>
  <text start="702.86" dur="6.33">raise rates in 2010 and we know that</text>
  <text start="705.89" dur="6.18">their housing market is in a bubble now</text>

  <text start="811.279" dur="4.231">bring it down when they&amp;#39;re ready to go</text>
  <text start="813.11" dur="3.39">and remember Janet Yellen was out there</text>
  <text start="815.51" dur="3.62">saying that we&amp;#39;re not going to see a</text>
  <text start="816.5" dur="5.13">financial crisis in our lifetime that is</text>

  <text start="821.63" dur="3.12">that this whole thing is going to</text>
  <text start="823.279" dur="4.531">completely fall apart because if you go</text>

  <text start="827.81" dur="3.12">these Fed Chairman say the same exact</text>
  <text start="830.45" dur="3.15">thing</text>
  <text start="830.93" dur="4.23">in a little bit of different way where</text>
  <text start="833.6" dur="3.84">Bernanke said you know we&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="839.72" dur="5.94">well she mentioned this this tells you</text>
  <text start="843.38" dur="5.52">that this whole thing is about to fall</text>

  <text start="848.9" dur="6.39">of 2018 she&amp;#39;s most likely looking to</text>

  <text start="859.699" dur="4.44">this going to hit we don&amp;#39;t exactly know</text>
  <text start="861.92" dur="5.669">I mean it could hit any time just like</text>
  <text start="864.139" dur="6.151">back in 2008 when Obama was running</text>
  <text start="867.589" dur="4.711">against McCain if people remember this</text>
  <text start="870.29" dur="4.38">and McCain was out there saying that the</text>
  <text start="872.3" dur="4.469">economy is perfectly healthy there is</text>
  <text start="874.67" dur="4.14">nothing wrong with the economy of course</text>
  <text start="876.769" dur="4.861">he had no clue what he was talking about</text>
  <text start="878.81" dur="6.509">and the economy crashed right before the</text>
  <text start="881.63" dur="6.269">elections in October I mean think about</text>
  <text start="885.319" dur="3.841">what happened there now all this time</text>
  <text start="887.899" dur="3.541">they were telling us everything was</text>
  <text start="889.16" dur="5.06">contained you don&amp;#39;t have to worry</text>
  <text start="891.44" dur="5.37">there&amp;#39;s no subprime security crisis</text>
  <text start="894.22" dur="5.77">everything looks fantastic housing</text>
  <text start="896.81" dur="5.459">doesn&amp;#39;t you know doesn&amp;#39;t fall down it</text>
  <text start="899.99" dur="6.42">doesn&amp;#39;t implode on itself that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="902.269" dur="5.49">ridiculous and from all our statistical</text>
  <text start="906.41" dur="3.419">evidence and everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="907.759" dur="4.38">researching we&amp;#39;re not forecasting any</text>
  <text start="909.829" dur="4.291">type of recession and if we go back to</text>
  <text start="912.139" dur="4.861">that time and if anyone saw the big</text>
  <text start="914.12" dur="5.01">short you know they were individuals who</text>
  <text start="917" dur="3.839">were scratching their head trying to</text>
  <text start="919.13" dur="3.93">figure this out saying okay the economy</text>
  <text start="920.839" dur="3.8">should have come down a long time ago</text>
  <text start="923.06" dur="3.269">actually these subprime securities</text>
  <text start="924.639" dur="4.06">they&amp;#39;re garbage</text>
  <text start="926.329" dur="4.051">but they&amp;#39;re rated triple-a something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="928.699" dur="3.63">wrong here and the whole thing and they</text>
  <text start="930.38" dur="3.35">projected when they thought the economy</text>
  <text start="932.329" dur="4.62">was going to come down and it never did</text>
  <text start="933.73" dur="5.339">it came down much later but they were</text>
  <text start="936.949" dur="4.89">right people were laughing at them</text>
  <text start="939.069" dur="4.39">people were pointing at them saying oh</text>
  <text start="941.839" dur="3.331">when is it going to come down oh when is</text>
  <text start="943.459" dur="3.63">it going to come down and of course they</text>
  <text start="945.17" dur="3.419">were getting nervous and saying okay</text>
  <text start="947.089" dur="3.18">when is this going to come down and all</text>
  <text start="948.589" dur="2.911">of a sudden everything came down and all</text>
  <text start="950.269" dur="3.781">those people that were laughing well</text>
  <text start="951.5" dur="5.22">they went bankrupt they lost everything</text>
  <text start="954.05" dur="4.2">they had and those individuals well they</text>
  <text start="956.72" dur="3.78">made billions and billions and billions</text>
  <text start="958.25" dur="4.769">of dollars the same thing is happening</text>
  <text start="960.5" dur="5.189">right now people are laughing people are</text>
  <text start="963.019" dur="5.851">pointing saying oh look you said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="965.689" dur="6.361">coming down when is it coming down well</text>
  <text start="968.87" dur="6.54">like I said before to build an illusion</text>
  <text start="972.05" dur="6.99">to build a structure to build a house to</text>
  <text start="975.41" dur="6">build something it takes a while for it</text>
  <text start="979.04" dur="3.69">to come down especially when you build</text>
  <text start="981.41" dur="3.919">something let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re building a</text>
  <text start="982.73" dur="6.329">building and you&amp;#39;re building it out of</text>
  <text start="985.329" dur="5.95">inferior cement inferior steel</text>
  <text start="989.059" dur="4.53">beam&amp;#39;s yes it might have taken five</text>
  <text start="991.279" dur="4.17">years to build that building but when</text>
  <text start="993.589" dur="4.65">that structure because it&amp;#39;s inferior</text>
  <text start="995.449" dur="4.44">because it&amp;#39;s built on an illusion when</text>
  <text start="998.239" dur="3.72">it starts to crack and come down</text>
  <text start="999.889" dur="4.98">it doesn&amp;#39;t take five years to come down</text>
  <text start="1001.959" dur="5.25">it comes down and split second the same</text>
  <text start="1004.869" dur="5.34">thing happens with the economy think</text>
  <text start="1007.209" dur="3.96">about last time all the way back to 2003</text>
  <text start="1010.209" dur="2.97">moving on</text>
  <text start="1011.169" dur="3.84">onward how long did it take them to</text>
  <text start="1013.179" dur="4.32">build the economy and create these</text>
  <text start="1015.009" dur="3.51">bubbles a long time how long did it take</text>
  <text start="1017.499" dur="4.05">it to come down</text>
  <text start="1018.519" dur="6.48">not that long the same thing is going to</text>
  <text start="1021.549" dur="5.28">happen once again and this time it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1024.999" dur="4.88">much much worse because they didn&amp;#39;t fix</text>
  <text start="1026.829" dur="6.06">the problem they didn&amp;#39;t do anything to</text>
  <text start="1029.879" dur="6.37">resolve the issues that we had before</text>
  <text start="1032.889" dur="7.29">all they did was pretend they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1036.249" dur="5.731">exist and they created this gigantic</text>
  <text start="1040.179" dur="4.02">illusion which a lot of people believe</text>
  <text start="1041.98" dur="5.13">in and all these people that are</text>
  <text start="1044.199" dur="5.19">believing in it well they&amp;#39;re in for a</text>
  <text start="1047.11" dur="5.069">rude awakening the whole thing is going</text>
  <text start="1049.389" dur="3.811">to fall apart and of course we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1052.179" dur="2.761">have a crystal ball we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1053.2" dur="4.049">exactly what is going to happen but</text>
  <text start="1054.94" dur="5.609">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking it and we&amp;#39;re finding</text>
  <text start="1057.249" dur="6.15">that yes the real nuts and bolt of the</text>
  <text start="1060.549" dur="5.401">economy it&amp;#39;s falling apart we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1063.399" dur="5.16">looking at the actual numbers of GDP of</text>
  <text start="1065.95" dur="5.91">unemployment corporate defaults</text>
  <text start="1068.559" dur="7.141">corporate tax revenue state receipts for</text>
  <text start="1071.86" dur="7.08">taxes federal tax revenue and we noticed</text>
  <text start="1075.7" dur="7.559">that guess what the tax revenue is not</text>
  <text start="1078.94" dur="5.939">there the jobs are fake we&amp;#39;re no longer</text>
  <text start="1083.259" dur="5.88">a manufacturing company we&amp;#39;re no longer</text>
  <text start="1084.879" dur="7.62">a service country and the housing market</text>
  <text start="1089.139" dur="5.49">is one gigantic fake bubble and the</text>
  <text start="1092.499" dur="6.03">retail market is imploding on itself and</text>
  <text start="1094.629" dur="7.081">people cannot find work they&amp;#39;re barely</text>
  <text start="1098.529" dur="5.13">getting by and I hate to say this but a</text>
  <text start="1101.71" dur="4.98">lot of people pretend around you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1103.659" dur="5.13">you don&amp;#39;t think that your neighbor or to</text>
  <text start="1106.69" dur="3.119">neighbors down everything is fine with</text>
  <text start="1108.789" dur="4.77">them because I&amp;#39;m going to tell you right</text>
  <text start="1109.809" dur="6.031">now most people will not tell you that</text>
  <text start="1113.559" dur="4.021">they&amp;#39;re out of work most people will not</text>
  <text start="1115.84" dur="3.87">tell you that they got laid off and</text>
  <text start="1117.58" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re working two part-time jobs I</text>
  <text start="1119.71" dur="5.25">remember back in 2008 people on both</text>
  <text start="1123.49" dur="4.069">I to me they lost their jobs I had no</text>
  <text start="1124.96" dur="6.27">clue I thought everything was fine until</text>
  <text start="1127.559" dur="5.981">much later on when all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="1131.23" dur="3.96">houses went up for sale people were</text>
  <text start="1133.54" dur="4.5">moving actually some people were</text>
