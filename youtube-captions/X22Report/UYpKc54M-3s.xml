  <text start="57.409" dur="6.54">this episode 1482 a n today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.219" dur="5.491">January 26 2018 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="63.949" dur="6.571">episode is alarm bells are going off</text>
  <text start="66.71" dur="5.579">market meltdown dead ahead let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="70.52" dur="3.739">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="72.289" dur="5.131">news now we&amp;#39;ve been talking a lot about</text>
  <text start="74.259" dur="5.021">cryptocurrency over the past couple of</text>
  <text start="77.42" dur="3.989">reports and we know that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="79.28" dur="4.17">decentralized we know the central</text>
  <text start="81.409" dur="5.88">bankers they definitely do not want this</text>
  <text start="83.45" dur="5.669">and they&amp;#39;re pushing their agenda to</text>
  <text start="87.289" dur="4.53">create laws to try to control that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="89.119" dur="4.56">their main agenda and don&amp;#39;t get me wrong</text>
  <text start="91.819" dur="4.561">I like crypto currencies I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="93.679" dur="4.5">fantastic and because the blockchain</text>
  <text start="96.38" dur="4.62">system is so decentralized it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="98.179" dur="6.541">very difficult to hack a decentralized</text>
  <text start="101" dur="5.52">type of system but hackers they can&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="104.72" dur="3.899">to the exchanges which is very</text>
  <text start="106.52" dur="5.129">interesting because this is not really</text>
  <text start="108.619" dur="5.7">part of the blockchain system these are</text>
  <text start="111.649" dur="4.97">like nodes outside that are accessing</text>
  <text start="114.319" dur="5.91">the blockchain where you can store your</text>
  <text start="116.619" dur="6.101">Bitcoin you can store your - you can</text>
  <text start="120.229" dur="4.111">store your litecoin you can store any of</text>
  <text start="122.72" dur="4.099">these different things there and you can</text>
  <text start="124.34" dur="5.22">also cash out and you can hold your</text>
  <text start="126.819" dur="4.241">cryptocurrency there and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="129.56" dur="2.67">interesting about this there&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="131.06" dur="3.179">there&amp;#39;s many different exchanges there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="132.23" dur="4.979">bit tricks there&amp;#39;s coinbase there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="134.239" dur="6.121">cracking in Japan there was one called</text>
  <text start="137.209" dur="5.821">coin check and they halted withdrawals</text>
  <text start="140.36" dur="5.849">of funds and Kryptos because it looks</text>
  <text start="143.03" dur="5.73">like they were hacked and it looks like</text>
  <text start="146.209" dur="6.151">they stole around something like four</text>
  <text start="148.76" dur="8.04">hundred million dollars worth of</text>
  <text start="152.36" dur="7.049">Japanese cryptocurrency and they just</text>
  <text start="156.8" dur="4.74">took it out of there and we can see</text>
  <text start="159.409" dur="3.601">right now that this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="161.54" dur="4.47">problem now this is no difference in</text>
  <text start="163.01" dur="3.99">someone coming in and robbing a bank or</text>
  <text start="166.01" dur="3.42">hacking</text>
  <text start="167" dur="5.19">into a banking system and stealing the</text>
  <text start="169.43" dur="5.43">currency there now once again the</text>
  <text start="172.19" dur="6.359">central bankers the government&amp;#39;s they</text>
  <text start="174.86" dur="5.82">want regulations they want to create law</text>
  <text start="178.549" dur="4.591">they want to create laws so they can</text>
  <text start="180.68" dur="5.25">protect you from this and again we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="183.14" dur="5.099">heard crimes in the past where there is</text>
  <text start="185.93" dur="5.009">those people that have stolen from the</text>
  <text start="188.239" dur="5.491">stock market that have stolen from the</text>
  <text start="190.939" dur="4.89">banking system it&amp;#39;s all the exactly the</text>
  <text start="193.73" dur="5.64">same and these regulations really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="195.829" dur="7.74">stop a criminal from getting in and</text>
  <text start="199.37" dur="6.989">stealing something the regulations well</text>
  <text start="203.569" dur="5.241">they control what they want to control</text>
  <text start="206.359" dur="5.761">it doesn&amp;#39;t stop anything it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="208.81" dur="4.989">creating laws and saying listen you</text>
  <text start="212.12" dur="4.199">shall not kill</text>
  <text start="213.799" dur="4.261">you shall now rob you shouldn&amp;#39;t do any</text>
  <text start="216.319" dur="3.721">of these things it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="218.06" dur="4.379">people aren&amp;#39;t going to do it just</text>
  <text start="220.04" dur="6.36">because you have laws just because you</text>
  <text start="222.439" dur="7.561">have regulations if we create terrorist</text>
  <text start="226.4" dur="5.899">laws it doesn&amp;#39;t stop a terrorists so we</text>
  <text start="230" dur="5.069">can see that that whole thing is</text>
  <text start="232.299" dur="4.84">completely ridiculous but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="235.069" dur="4.5">seeing here is that they want to</text>
  <text start="237.139" dur="4.77">regulate now most likely the exchanges</text>
  <text start="239.569" dur="5.161">and coin check is a very well known</text>
  <text start="241.909" dur="5.041">exchange in Japan and we can see that</text>
  <text start="244.73" dur="5.729">they were hacked into a lot of money was</text>
  <text start="246.95" dur="5.009">completely taken from it and people are</text>
  <text start="250.459" dur="4.56">sitting there going oh my god what am I</text>
  <text start="251.959" dur="5.611">going to do and once again this is all</text>
  <text start="255.019" dur="5.881">about control and I do believe that this</text>
  <text start="257.57" dur="6.87">most likely was planned here in the US</text>
  <text start="260.9" dur="7.11">we see the economy is still falling</text>
  <text start="264.44" dur="5.969">apart now we know that minuchin he tried</text>
  <text start="268.01" dur="5.25">to bring down the economy not him</text>
  <text start="270.409" dur="4.021">himself but all those individuals behind</text>
  <text start="273.26" dur="3.149">him I don&amp;#39;t believe he&amp;#39;s part of the</text>
  <text start="274.43" dur="3.45">Trump administration I believe he&amp;#39;s part</text>
  <text start="276.409" dur="4.201">of the central banking system he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="277.88" dur="4.68">goldman sachs boy and it looks like they</text>
  <text start="280.61" dur="5.16">tried to make a move to try to bring</text>
  <text start="282.56" dur="5.55">down the system and it was blocked</text>
  <text start="285.77" dur="3.899">as we can see Trump came out and said no</text>
  <text start="288.11" dur="3.6">no we&amp;#39;re not weakening the dollar that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="289.669" dur="3.961">not our new policy the dollar is going</text>
  <text start="291.71" dur="3.09">to be strong because Trump wants the</text>
  <text start="293.63" dur="3.029">narrative and wants to keep the</text>
  <text start="294.8" dur="4.47">narrative and wants to control the</text>
  <text start="296.659" dur="4.681">entire system when it does come down so</text>
  <text start="299.27" dur="3.989">he can blame this on the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="301.34" dur="4.77">but what we&amp;#39;re seeing here in the United</text>
  <text start="303.259" dur="5.041">States is that core durable goods they</text>
  <text start="306.11" dur="3.69">have completely tumbled now another</text>
  <text start="308.3" dur="4.07">Corbeau media is out there saying wow</text>
  <text start="309.8" dur="5.94">core durable goods are up because of</text>
  <text start="312.37" dur="4.99">aircraft orders and war spending and it</text>
  <text start="315.74" dur="4.05">looks great but if you remove that</text>
  <text start="317.36" dur="6.36">because we need to understand</text>
  <text start="319.79" dur="5.1">or spending and aircraft orders it helps</text>
  <text start="323.72" dur="3.57">a little bit but doesn&amp;#39;t help the</text>
  <text start="324.89" dur="5.13">everyday person doesn&amp;#39;t help many of the</text>
  <text start="327.29" dur="5.06">stores the manufacturers doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="330.02" dur="5.31">help that much if you remove all that</text>
  <text start="332.35" dur="5.02">core durable goods that it dropped by</text>
  <text start="335.33" dur="4.05">0.3% in court durable goods is like</text>
  <text start="337.37" dur="4.92">washing machines the big-ticket items</text>
  <text start="339.38" dur="6.06">and that completely felon it looks like</text>
  <text start="342.29" dur="7.98">this is the most in 12 months so at the</text>
  <text start="345.44" dur="6.78">core orders tumbled most in a year now</text>
  <text start="350.27" dur="3.3">we look at the GDP now they were</text>
  <text start="352.22" dur="4.41">expecting the GDP to come in around</text>
  <text start="353.57" dur="5.76">something like 4% then they said ok</text>
  <text start="356.63" dur="5.16">maybe it&amp;#39;ll come around a 3% it came in</text>
  <text start="359.33" dur="4.95">around 2.6 percent this is the lowest</text>
  <text start="361.79" dur="5.22">since the first quarter of 2017 when</text>
  <text start="364.28" dur="6.27">Obama he couldn&amp;#39;t you know get the GDP</text>
  <text start="367.01" dur="6.33">above 3% until they manipulated it a lot</text>
  <text start="370.55" dur="5.16">revised the numbers you know exported</text>
  <text start="373.34" dur="4.71">soy products and things like that just</text>
  <text start="375.71" dur="4.14">to push the GDP up to that point where</text>
  <text start="378.05" dur="5.04">he can say see I had a quarter that was</text>
  <text start="379.85" dur="5.13">3% but when we look at this and we look</text>
  <text start="383.09" dur="6.11">at the numbers and we dig a little bit</text>
  <text start="384.98" dur="7.68">deeper we can see that well not</text>
  <text start="389.2" dur="4.54">everything is as good as it seems I mean</text>
  <text start="392.66" dur="3.63">everyone&amp;#39;s going to be out there saying</text>
  <text start="393.74" dur="4.8">WOW 2.6 percent that&amp;#39;s not bad that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="396.29" dur="6.99">pretty close to three percent but this</text>
  <text start="398.54" dur="7.47">number has a major caveat much of it was</text>
  <text start="403.28" dur="4.92">a result of a surge in credit card</text>
  <text start="406.01" dur="3.63">funded spending while the personal</text>
  <text start="408.2" dur="5.01">savings rate dropped to levels last seen</text>
  <text start="409.64" dur="5.79">during the financial crisis 13 week</text>
  <text start="413.21" dur="5.37">annualized credit card balances in the</text>
  <text start="415.43" dur="7.44">US had gone completely vertical in the</text>
  <text start="418.58" dur="7.2">last few months of 2017 so let&amp;#39;s think</text>
  <text start="422.87" dur="5.31">about this thing we know before we</text>
  <text start="425.78" dur="4.47">reported on the credit cards moving up</text>
  <text start="428.18" dur="3.63">and there was a report out there saying</text>
  <text start="430.25" dur="4.62">a lot of people were using their credit</text>
  <text start="431.81" dur="6.36">cards to purchase Bitcoin the corporate</text>
  <text start="434.87" dur="6.24">media played this up and it was you know</text>
  <text start="438.17" dur="5.64">continually pushed to the american</text>
  <text start="441.11" dur="4.5">people over and over and over saying oh</text>
  <text start="443.81" dur="3.75">look how high bitcoins going look how</text>
  <text start="445.61" dur="3.72">highs bitcoins going you can make a lot</text>
  <text start="447.56" dur="3.6">of money and if you notice a lot of</text>
  <text start="449.33" dur="3.99">people they know what bitcoin is doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="451.16" dur="2.7">mean they&amp;#39;re involved but they know what</text>
  <text start="453.32" dur="3.09">it is</text>
  <text start="453.86" dur="5.339">so people said you know what I&amp;#39;ll use my</text>
  <text start="456.41" dur="4.92">credit cards and I&amp;#39;ll purchase Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="459.199" dur="4.59">and I&amp;#39;ll make a lot of money I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="461.33" dur="4.619">able to pay off the credit card and this</text>
  <text start="463.789" dur="3.841">will be great and that&amp;#39;s why most likely</text>
  <text start="465.949" dur="4.411">we saw a credit card surge we also saw</text>
  <text start="467.63" dur="4.849">it because most of the individuals out</text>
  <text start="470.36" dur="5.01">there they don&amp;#39;t have high paying jobs</text>
  <text start="472.479" dur="4.391">many people lost their jobs and they</text>
  <text start="475.37" dur="4.049">were using credit cards for the holiday</text>
  <text start="476.87" dur="5.91">season even though the holiday season</text>
  <text start="479.419" dur="5.25">wasn&amp;#39;t as great as everyone has said now</text>
  <text start="482.78" dur="4.29">when we look at this we can see that yes</text>
  <text start="484.669" dur="4.951">it has gone vertical in the last few</text>
  <text start="487.07" dur="4.89">months of 2017 and most likely this is</text>
  <text start="489.62" dur="5.13">the reason why now even more troubling</text>
  <text start="491.96" dur="6.06">was the ongoing collapse in the US</text>
  <text start="494.75" dur="5.43">personal savings rate which last month</text>
  <text start="498.02" dur="5.429">tumbled to the lowest level since the</text>
  <text start="500.18" dur="5.64">financial crisis because US consumers</text>
  <text start="503.449" dur="5">drained what little of their savings</text>
  <text start="505.82" dur="5.49">they had and they spent it most likely</text>
  <text start="508.449" dur="6.161">during the holiday season maybe even on</text>
  <text start="511.31" dur="4.56">Bitcoin and former Merrill Kannamma</text>
  <text start="514.61" dur="3.66">described what is going on as the</text>
  <text start="515.87" dur="5.82">twilight zone economy for the following</text>
  <text start="518.27" dur="6.6">reason how many times in the past have</text>
  <text start="521.69" dur="6.18">we seen a 2.6 percent 2.6 percent</text>
  <text start="524.87" dur="7.38">savings rate coincide with a four point</text>
  <text start="527.87" dur="9.45">one percent jobless rate how about never</text>
  <text start="532.25" dur="7.41">it doesn&amp;#39;t even make sense the savings</text>
  <text start="537.32" dur="4.32">rate fell from three point three percent</text>
  <text start="539.66" dur="4.74">to two point six percent if it had</text>
  <text start="541.64" dur="4.86">stayed the same the real PCE would have</text>
  <text start="544.4" dur="4.47">been point eight percent instead of</text>
  <text start="546.5" dur="4.529">three point eight percent and GDP would</text>
  <text start="548.87" dur="4.11">have been point six percent instead of</text>
  <text start="551.029" dur="5.131">two point six percent now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="552.98" dur="5.52">interesting is that during the fourth</text>
  <text start="556.16" dur="3.84">quarter the GDP number they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="558.5" dur="4.11">two point six percent it will be revised</text>
  <text start="560" dur="5.329">again and again and again but this is</text>
  <text start="562.61" dur="5.31">when we had a booming stock market</text>
  <text start="565.329" dur="5.711">massive post hurricane repair and</text>
  <text start="567.92" dur="7.289">rebuild a consumer credit card binge and</text>
  <text start="571.04" dur="7.56">this is the highest GDP we can get out</text>
  <text start="575.209" dur="6.031">of all of that the reason for this is</text>
  <text start="578.6" dur="4.739">that it&amp;#39;s completely made up</text>
  <text start="581.24" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s an illusion that&amp;#39;s why it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="583.339" dur="4.141">make sense this is why we have a two</text>
  <text start="585.32" dur="5.76">point six percent savings</text>
  <text start="587.48" dur="5.67">with a 4.1% jobless rate I mean think</text>
  <text start="591.08" dur="4.86">about that for a second what kind of</text>
  <text start="593.15" dur="5.07">jobs do people have then is this real or</text>
  <text start="595.94" dur="5.04">many people out of work and many people</text>
  <text start="598.22" dur="5.93">have part-time jobs and this is why we</text>
  <text start="600.98" dur="6.24">see tax receipts continually falling</text>
  <text start="604.15" dur="4.9">because when people lose their jobs like</text>
  <text start="607.22" dur="4.35">yesterday we talked about the retail</text>
  <text start="609.05" dur="3.41">industry a hundred thousand jobs are</text>
  <text start="611.57" dur="4.47">gonna be lost</text>
  <text start="612.46" dur="5.59">which means that this most likely will</text>
  <text start="616.04" dur="4.23">not be counted in the unemployment</text>
  <text start="618.05" dur="3.15">numbers unless their full-time jobs</text>
  <text start="620.27" dur="3.3">unless they meet certain requirements</text>
  <text start="621.2" dur="4.11">like 30 hours a week and they got paid a</text>
  <text start="623.57" dur="3.42">certain amount but these people who are</text>
  <text start="625.31" dur="3.87">working in these part-time jobs they</text>
  <text start="626.99" dur="5.22">were counted as full-time jobs but when</text>
  <text start="629.18" dur="4.56">they lose the job they won&amp;#39;t be counted</text>
  <text start="632.21" dur="4.5">because they didn&amp;#39;t meet those</text>
  <text start="633.74" dur="5.52">requirements they&amp;#39;re skewing the numbers</text>
  <text start="636.71" dur="5.64">so most likely the unemployment number</text>
  <text start="639.26" dur="5.04">will go down to 4% maybe even 3.9 but we</text>
  <text start="642.35" dur="5.1">know a hundred thousand people lost</text>
  <text start="644.3" dur="7.44">their job something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="647.45" dur="6.75">and again what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that we</text>
  <text start="651.74" dur="5.76">have rising bond yields full employment</text>
  <text start="654.2" dur="7.32">fed tightening trade frictions weak</text>
  <text start="657.5" dur="6.68">dollar rising twin deficits spurred by</text>
  <text start="661.52" dur="6.9">tax reform does all this sound familiar</text>
  <text start="664.18" dur="6.58">this is what happened in 1987 and what</text>
  <text start="668.42" dur="4.44">happened during that period of time well</text>
  <text start="670.76" dur="4.71">the market completely crashed again</text>
  <text start="672.86" dur="4.89">today they have the ability to keep it</text>
  <text start="675.47" dur="4.56">all up and running they&amp;#39;ve learned from</text>
  <text start="677.75" dur="4.41">their past mistakes they understand this</text>
  <text start="680.03" dur="4.95">right now Trump most likely is</text>
  <text start="682.16" dur="5.64">controlling the stock market the Fed I</text>
  <text start="684.98" dur="5.25">think they want to crash the market and</text>
  <text start="687.8" dur="4.23">blame it on Trump he&amp;#39;s been in there for</text>
  <text start="690.23" dur="3.42">a year I think they&amp;#39;re gonna make</text>
  <text start="692.03" dur="6.36">another move I think they&amp;#39;re gonna try</text>
  <text start="693.65" dur="6.72">once again and the reason why the market</text>
  <text start="698.39" dur="5.52">has been kept up and we mentioned this</text>
  <text start="700.37" dur="5.7">before is the Swiss National Bank now</text>
  <text start="703.91" dur="3.78">eleven thousand five hundred eighty nine</text>
  <text start="706.07" dur="5.64">dollars why is this number important</text>
  <text start="707.69" dur="6.39">well that&amp;#39;s the u.s. dollar amount of</text>
  <text start="711.71" dur="4.65">American stocks the Swiss National Bank</text>
  <text start="714.08" dur="6.21">owns on behalf of every man woman and</text>
  <text start="716.36" dur="4.74">child in Switzerland the central bank</text>
  <text start="720.29" dur="2.49">has taken</text>
  <text start="721.1" dur="4.2">on itself to expand its balance sheet</text>
  <text start="722.78" dur="5.58">and an invest in the proceeds not in</text>
  <text start="725.3" dur="5.82">gold nor sovereign-debt not even</text>
  <text start="728.36" dur="6.99">corporate bonds nope they decided to</text>
  <text start="731.12" dur="7.35">take the money and invest that money in</text>
  <text start="735.35" dur="5.94">another country&amp;#39;s most risky part of the</text>
  <text start="738.47" dur="6.81">capital structure equity does this make</text>
  <text start="741.29" dur="5.76">any sense whatsoever and don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="745.28" dur="6.74">it&amp;#39;s a small number it&amp;#39;s almost a</text>
  <text start="747.05" dur="8.7">hundred billion US dollars this is</text>
  <text start="752.02" dur="6.61">unbelievable why would a country take a</text>
  <text start="755.75" dur="7.32">hundred billion and put it into the</text>
  <text start="758.63" dur="7.83">stock market and this is the people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="763.07" dur="6.6">money I mean you could see how crazy</text>
  <text start="766.46" dur="5.37">this is and the real problem is that the</text>
  <text start="769.67" dur="3.84">central bank just monetized their</text>
  <text start="771.83" dur="5.07">balance sheet against another country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="773.51" dur="5.67">equity market the Swiss National Bank</text>
  <text start="776.9" dur="4.17">has gone down a rabbit hole and when</text>
  <text start="779.18" dur="5.82">everything starts to fall apart guess</text>
  <text start="781.07" dur="8.09">what they&amp;#39;re gonna lose the people are</text>
  <text start="785" dur="9.21">going to lose so we can see right now</text>
  <text start="789.16" dur="7.81">they&amp;#39;ve been keeping the market up by</text>
  <text start="794.21" dur="5.07">having the central bank&amp;#39;s purchase by</text>
  <text start="796.97" dur="4.86">pushing buttons has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="799.28" dur="5.85">corporate revenue has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="801.83" dur="5.31">how much sales the corporation&amp;#39;s have</text>
  <text start="805.13" dur="4.11">has nothing to do with any of that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="807.14" dur="4.41">one gigantic illusion now Bank of</text>
  <text start="809.24" dur="5.01">America is out there and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="811.55" dur="3.09">there&amp;#39;s an imminent market crash headed</text>
  <text start="814.25" dur="2.52">our way</text>
  <text start="814.64" dur="5.13">and they said their indicator was just</text>
  <text start="816.77" dur="7.76">triggered and what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="819.77" dur="7.41">that their bull and bear indicator surge</text>
  <text start="824.53" dur="5.29">27.9 the highest since the last cell</text>
  <text start="827.18" dur="4.23">signal of eight triggered March 13th and</text>
  <text start="829.82" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="831.41" dur="6.72">tactical pullback most likely in</text>
  <text start="834.83" dur="5.37">February and March very likely and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="838.13" dur="4.65">gonna see the market come down now once</text>
  <text start="840.2" dur="4.56">again is this going to be the</text>
  <text start="842.78" dur="4.44">opportunity where Trump says ok let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="844.76" dur="4.5">let the market go instead of hitting the</text>
  <text start="847.22" dur="5.49">button and having the Swiss National</text>
  <text start="849.26" dur="5.79">Bank purchase more stocks or is the</text>
  <text start="852.71" dur="4.26">central bank going to say</text>
  <text start="855.05" dur="3.93">let&amp;#39;s let let&amp;#39;s let this whole thing go</text>
  <text start="856.97" dur="5.04">and let&amp;#39;s bring it all down</text>
  <text start="858.98" dur="6.33">now remember Trump still has control of</text>
  <text start="862.01" dur="5.579">the stock market he&amp;#39;s the one who was</text>
  <text start="865.31" dur="2.61">continually pushing this up and up and</text>
  <text start="867.589" dur="4.49">up</text>
  <text start="867.92" dur="8.25">the central bank they have the power to</text>
  <text start="872.079" dur="6.88">purchase stocks to drive the market up</text>
  <text start="876.17" dur="5.58">so Trump has the plunge Protection Team</text>
  <text start="878.959" dur="5.911">the high frequency trading he can keep</text>
  <text start="881.75" dur="5.04">the market rising and the central bank</text>
  <text start="884.87" dur="4.529">can say to the Swiss National Bank okay</text>
  <text start="886.79" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s time to cut it that means Trump</text>
  <text start="889.399" dur="4.68">would have to do you know major major</text>
  <text start="891.68" dur="4.29">type of manipulation to get the market</text>
  <text start="894.079" dur="4.291">up and they could bring it down and we</text>
  <text start="895.97" dur="4.17">can see right now this is where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="898.37" dur="5.7">headed I think what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="900.14" dur="5.819">come February March moving forward is</text>
  <text start="904.07" dur="3.9">that we&amp;#39;re going to see this battle</text>
  <text start="905.959" dur="4.411">between Trump and the Central Bank and</text>
  <text start="907.97" dur="4.02">the central bank already signaled they</text>
  <text start="910.37" dur="2.82">want to bring this down because they</text>
  <text start="911.99" dur="4.52">want to blame it on Trump Trump already</text>
  <text start="913.19" dur="5.7">signaled that he&amp;#39;s not ready the</text>
  <text start="916.51" dur="5.35">transition the full control of the</text>
  <text start="918.89" dur="5.49">government he does not have this as of</text>
  <text start="921.86" dur="4.32">yet he&amp;#39;s getting there the people that</text>
  <text start="924.38" dur="4.38">are working with him they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="926.18" dur="5.219">there but full control they do not have</text>
  <text start="928.76" dur="4.86">so we can see right now the central bank</text>
  <text start="931.399" dur="4.081">though is looking at this and saying we</text>
  <text start="933.62" dur="4.65">are ready to bring this down they</text>
  <text start="935.48" dur="5.19">already signaled it with minutia n--</text>
  <text start="938.27" dur="5.85">coming out and saying we&amp;#39;re gonna have a</text>
  <text start="940.67" dur="6.659">weak dollar policy where then Trump</text>
  <text start="944.12" dur="5.339">quickly corrected this but we see right</text>
  <text start="947.329" dur="3.57">now they&amp;#39;re going to try another tactic</text>
  <text start="949.459" dur="3.931">another tactic might be the Swiss</text>
  <text start="950.899" dur="5.551">National Bank saying okay now it&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="953.39" dur="6.18">to start selling maybe this is why Bank</text>
  <text start="956.45" dur="4.949">of America is reading this indicator</text>
  <text start="959.57" dur="3.629">where they&amp;#39;re saying now there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="961.399" dur="3.661">to be a selling we also have the pension</text>
  <text start="963.199" dur="4.83">funds during the same type of period</text>
  <text start="965.06" dur="5.7">where they&amp;#39;re gonna start selling so the</text>
  <text start="968.029" dur="8.041">central bank might have ammo right now</text>
  <text start="970.76" dur="6.96">to bring down the economy and Trump will</text>
  <text start="976.07" dur="3.959">have a very difficult time to try to</text>
  <text start="977.72" dur="4.08">keep it from collapsing right now</text>
  <text start="980.029" dur="3.81">because I don&amp;#39;t believe he&amp;#39;s prepared</text>
  <text start="981.8" dur="4.5">and ready for this system to come down</text>
  <text start="983.839" dur="4.69">as of yet but the central banks we need</text>
  <text start="986.3" dur="4.329">to remember they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="988.529" dur="3.54">they don&amp;#39;t care if people suffer they</text>
  <text start="990.629" dur="4.351">don&amp;#39;t care people lose everything</text>
  <text start="992.069" dur="4.68">because they&amp;#39;re always okay the people</text>
  <text start="994.98" dur="3.87">that support the central bank they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="996.749" dur="5.551">always okay they&amp;#39;re ready to short</text>
  <text start="998.85" dur="7.31">everything and we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="1002.3" dur="7.17">going to be a heated period of time and</text>
  <text start="1006.16" dur="5.44">things are going to get really really</text>
  <text start="1009.47" dur="3.779">crazy in the next couple of months and</text>
  <text start="1011.6" dur="3.899">we&amp;#39;re going to be looking at different</text>
  <text start="1013.249" dur="4.08">indicators and signs to see what is</text>
  <text start="1015.499" dur="4.44">going on here but I would expect if</text>
  <text start="1017.329" dur="4.651">they&amp;#39;re reading this right now that</text>
  <text start="1019.939" dur="3.9">something big is going to happen because</text>
  <text start="1021.98" dur="6.059">I could see right now it&amp;#39;s almost like a</text>
  <text start="1023.839" dur="6.6">perfect storm that they created and is</text>
  <text start="1028.039" dur="7.951">headed our way where they can do this</text>
  <text start="1030.439" dur="8.1">easily by cutting the funding of the</text>
  <text start="1035.99" dur="5.16">purchasing of stocks the pensions are</text>
  <text start="1038.539" dur="4.77">going to sell off and the market is</text>
  <text start="1041.15" dur="5.789">going to come down maybe 20% 30%</text>
  <text start="1043.309" dur="5.971">whatever it is and we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="1046.939" dur="5.311">what Trump does at that time but we can</text>
  <text start="1049.28" dur="5.43">see right now they are ready to go it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1052.25" dur="4.44">go time and they&amp;#39;re ready to pull the</text>
  <text start="1054.71" dur="3.78">plug and they&amp;#39;re ready to blame this all</text>
