  <text start="61.75" dur="6">March 19th 2018 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="64.72" dur="6.75">episode is Trump&amp;#39;s policies are pushing</text>
  <text start="67.75" dur="5.52">the Fed to break the system let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="71.47" dur="4.59">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="73.27" dur="6.63">news now we have a major battle going on</text>
  <text start="76.06" dur="7.29">between the Trump administration and the</text>
  <text start="79.9" dur="5.67">central banking system and the central</text>
  <text start="83.35" dur="5.22">banking system right now they are</text>
  <text start="85.57" dur="5.64">pushing their agenda and they are going</text>
  <text start="88.57" dur="4.53">to be raising rates on the other hand we</text>
  <text start="91.21" dur="5.46">have the Trump administration where</text>
  <text start="93.1" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re having tax cuts they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="96.67" dur="4.65">tariffs where the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="99.49" dur="3.57">out there screaming about trade wars</text>
  <text start="101.32" dur="3.93">other countries are talking about trade</text>
  <text start="103.06" dur="4.919">Wars those who are completely against</text>
  <text start="105.25" dur="4.56">this are talking about trade wars and we</text>
  <text start="107.979" dur="5.28">can see phase two of his tax cuts are</text>
  <text start="109.81" dur="6.48">coming into place and what is happening</text>
  <text start="113.259" dur="6.511">here is the move that Trump is making</text>
  <text start="116.29" dur="8.85">right now is to is to basically break</text>
  <text start="119.77" dur="7.89">the Fed and make them make a move which</text>
  <text start="125.14" dur="4.71">would bring down the economy now on the</text>
  <text start="127.66" dur="4.98">Fed on the other hand what they are</text>
  <text start="129.85" dur="4.56">doing is they are slowly raising the</text>
  <text start="132.64" dur="5.43">interest rates trying to bring down the</text>
  <text start="134.41" dur="5.64">economy in a natural-looking way so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="138.07" dur="4.83">not blamed on them it&amp;#39;s blamed on</text>
  <text start="140.05" dur="5.219">Trump&amp;#39;s policies this is what is</text>
  <text start="142.9" dur="4.32">happening right now normally what the</text>
  <text start="145.269" dur="4.47">central bank likes to do is they like to</text>
  <text start="147.22" dur="4.739">have some type of an event where they</text>
  <text start="149.739" dur="5.011">can blame all of this on that event</text>
  <text start="151.959" dur="4.5">sometimes or most of the time it is some</text>
  <text start="154.75" dur="3.36">type of war where there&amp;#39;s an attack and</text>
  <text start="156.459" dur="4.53">they can say look the economy&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="158.11" dur="5.46">doing well because of that now if</text>
  <text start="160.989" dur="5.341">Clinton was president I believe we would</text>
  <text start="163.57" dur="4.77">be heading down that track with Obama we</text>
  <text start="166.33" dur="4.89">were heading down that track but things</text>
  <text start="168.34" dur="5.97">have definitely changed actually</text>
  <text start="171.22" dur="6.21">everything has changed and things are</text>
  <text start="174.31" dur="6.12">moving in different directions now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="177.43" dur="6.209">very interesting is DiMartino booth was</text>
  <text start="180.43" dur="5.779">out there and she was saying the</text>
  <text start="183.639" dur="5.511">following we just had a</text>
  <text start="186.209" dur="6">huge fiscal stimulus with the recent tax</text>
  <text start="189.15" dur="6.3">cut but monetary policy is going in the</text>
  <text start="192.209" dur="5.551">opposite direction eventually she said</text>
  <text start="195.45" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re going to have one of those moments</text>
  <text start="197.76" dur="6.539">where the Fed overshoots and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="200.28" dur="6.739">moved too far too fast I believe this is</text>
  <text start="204.299" dur="5.431">what Trump is trying to get them to do</text>
  <text start="207.019" dur="5.53">now of course we don&amp;#39;t know when this is</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="7.08">going to be we don&amp;#39;t know how it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="212.549" dur="8.041">to be but all we know is that by the Fed</text>
  <text start="216.81" dur="6.989">raising their rates and as they</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="7.739">continually raise their rates with the</text>
  <text start="223.799" dur="8.491">tax cuts with the tariffs Trump is</text>
  <text start="228.329" dur="7.321">hoping that it breaks the market and</text>
  <text start="232.29" dur="6.36">brings down the system now he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="235.65" dur="7.259">try to gain the narrative on the entire</text>
  <text start="238.65" dur="7.289">situation and make a case where we need</text>
  <text start="242.909" dur="6.29">to go and audit the Fed we need to</text>
  <text start="245.939" dur="8.97">understand what they are doing to the</text>
  <text start="249.199" dur="8.051">country&amp;#39;s economy and the only way to do</text>
  <text start="254.909" dur="4.83">this is to pass a bill and this is why</text>
  <text start="257.25" dur="4.049">Rand Paul has the audit the Fed bill now</text>
  <text start="259.739" dur="4.021">his father tried this many many times</text>
  <text start="261.299" dur="3.691">and if this fails I don&amp;#39;t think Rand</text>
  <text start="263.76" dur="4.439">Paul is gonna give up I think he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="264.99" dur="6.12">try once again we need to understand is</text>
  <text start="268.199" dur="6.21">that we have a huge amount of debt in</text>
  <text start="271.11" dur="6.839">this country we&amp;#39;re on track for a</text>
  <text start="274.409" dur="5.161">trillion dollar deficit in 2019 at the</text>
  <text start="277.949" dur="3.931">same time China and others are buying</text>
  <text start="279.57" dur="7.279">fewer Treasuries I mean think of the</text>
  <text start="281.88" dur="7.89">scenario right now if the rates</text>
  <text start="286.849" dur="6.011">continually move up well we won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="289.77" dur="6.42">able to pay back the interest on the</text>
  <text start="292.86" dur="5.399">debt or the debt itself and what that</text>
  <text start="296.19" dur="6.06">means is we&amp;#39;re heading towards some type</text>
  <text start="298.259" dur="6.03">of default and if you look at every time</text>
  <text start="302.25" dur="5.159">we had some type of recession or</text>
  <text start="304.289" dur="7.141">depression we can see from the financial</text>
  <text start="307.409" dur="7.94">sense fund funds risk neutral index that</text>
  <text start="311.43" dur="7.57">we get to a point where all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="315.349" dur="5.901">the Fed is relatively loose</text>
  <text start="319" dur="4.68">and then they have to tighten we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="321.25" dur="5.76">the loose area actually in the middle of</text>
  <text start="323.68" dur="5.49">it which means which tells me that we</text>
  <text start="327.01" dur="5.49">don&amp;#39;t have that much longer to go maybe</text>
  <text start="329.17" dur="6.3">a couple of months or a year or two or</text>
  <text start="332.5" dur="5.94">three until the system starts to fall</text>
  <text start="335.47" dur="4.85">apart I don&amp;#39;t think the Trump</text>
  <text start="338.44" dur="5.34">administration those Patriots working on</text>
  <text start="340.32" dur="6.46">what is happening here want to wait that</text>
  <text start="343.78" dur="6.18">long what they want to do is they want</text>
  <text start="346.78" dur="6.66">to speed up the process they want to do</text>
  <text start="349.96" dur="7.709">this because they need to transition us</text>
  <text start="353.44" dur="6.03">out of the central banking system and we</text>
  <text start="357.669" dur="4.281">can see at this point this is where we</text>
  <text start="359.47" dur="6.09">are headed this is the plan and</text>
  <text start="361.95" dur="6.25">eventually the plan is to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="365.56" dur="6.93">central banking system to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="368.2" dur="7.62">Fed hopefully to get rid of taxes income</text>
  <text start="372.49" dur="6.75">taxes and maybe even move further than</text>
  <text start="375.82" dur="5.64">that now this is a long shot this is</text>
  <text start="379.24" dur="5.239">what they&amp;#39;re planning to do there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="381.46" dur="5.73">reason to have a central banking system</text>
  <text start="384.479" dur="5.891">we know that gold has been suppressed</text>
  <text start="387.19" dur="6.99">manipulated to keep the central banking</text>
  <text start="390.37" dur="6.51">system looking fantastic if we remove</text>
  <text start="394.18" dur="5.31">the manipulation if we remove the</text>
  <text start="396.88" dur="5.7">suppression of gold and silver and let</text>
  <text start="399.49" dur="6.72">the markets just be free we would see</text>
  <text start="402.58" dur="6.45">how bad the economy is right now we</text>
  <text start="406.21" dur="5.01">would see gold move up dramatically</text>
  <text start="409.03" dur="6.36">which is an indicator letting us know</text>
  <text start="411.22" dur="7.86">how bad fiat currency is this is why</text>
  <text start="415.39" dur="6.779">they&amp;#39;ve been controlling gold since 1975</text>
  <text start="419.08" dur="5.22">there&amp;#39;s a reason why they do all of this</text>
  <text start="422.169" dur="4.951">it&amp;#39;s not because oh let&amp;#39;s just have a</text>
  <text start="424.3" dur="6.15">paper market they do it for a specific</text>
  <text start="427.12" dur="5.609">reason to keep everyone in the dark and</text>
  <text start="430.45" dur="4.65">of course as they use this manipulation</text>
  <text start="432.729" dur="5.581">all throughout the years those people</text>
  <text start="435.1" dur="5.79">who are born in the 80s then in the 90s</text>
  <text start="438.31" dur="4.65">then in 2000 they all think this is</text>
  <text start="440.89" dur="6.3">normal this is the way it&amp;#39;s supposed to</text>
  <text start="442.96" dur="7.74">run but it&amp;#39;s not the central bankers</text>
  <text start="447.19" dur="5.43">made it seem that way and those who are</text>
  <text start="450.7" dur="4.32">being born into the system have</text>
  <text start="452.62" dur="5.04">knowledge that it&amp;#39;s not supposed to be</text>
  <text start="455.02" dur="4.8">this way everyone believes we should be</text>
  <text start="457.66" dur="4.65">living on debt that you should have a</text>
  <text start="459.82" dur="5.43">credit card the value of the dollar</text>
  <text start="462.31" dur="5.82">continually decreases we always see</text>
  <text start="465.25" dur="6.419">inflation this is a central bankers</text>
  <text start="468.13" dur="5.58">economy this is their world this is what</text>
  <text start="471.669" dur="5.641">they created and made you believe that</text>
  <text start="473.71" dur="7.38">this is what is supposed to be but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="477.31" dur="6.15">not there was a time where this didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="481.09" dur="5.04">exist and we need to remember something</text>
  <text start="483.46" dur="3.51">very important here it&amp;#39;s not just the</text>
  <text start="486.13" dur="3.72">economy</text>
  <text start="486.97" dur="3.18">it&amp;#39;s everything that is going on right</text>
  <text start="489.85" dur="2.46">now</text>
  <text start="490.15" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening out in the Middle</text>
  <text start="492.31" dur="5.01">East with the petro dollar where</text>
  <text start="494.32" dur="5.67">countries now are asking the u.s. to</text>
  <text start="497.32" dur="5.7">leave that area and the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="499.99" dur="5.67">most likely will no longer exist we see</text>
  <text start="503.02" dur="6.33">China dumping Treasuries we see China</text>
  <text start="505.66" dur="6.12">right now hoarding a huge amount of gold</text>
  <text start="509.35" dur="4.71">Russia is doing the same we see the bail</text>
  <text start="511.78" dur="5.91">in road we see the manufacturing has</text>
  <text start="514.06" dur="5.789">been all moved out to China we see what</text>
  <text start="517.69" dur="4.44">is happening within government here in</text>
  <text start="519.849" dur="5.041">the United States where there are people</text>
  <text start="522.13" dur="6.48">being fired left and right there is a</text>
  <text start="524.89" dur="8.46">lot happening all at once so everything</text>
  <text start="528.61" dur="7.2">is tied in to everything else and if we</text>
  <text start="533.35" dur="5.489">look at and we step back and we look at</text>
  <text start="535.81" dur="5.64">all of this we can see what is</text>
  <text start="538.839" dur="4.861">responsible for all this and this is the</text>
  <text start="541.45" dur="7.59">central banking system the central</text>
  <text start="543.7" dur="9.78">banking system is set up to create</text>
  <text start="549.04" dur="8.4">corruption it&amp;#39;s set up to create Wars</text>
  <text start="553.48" dur="6.63">it&amp;#39;s set up to create debt and to put</text>
  <text start="557.44" dur="5.88">government&amp;#39;s into debt it&amp;#39;s set up to</text>
  <text start="560.11" dur="5.76">control the individual person it&amp;#39;s set</text>
  <text start="563.32" dur="7.41">up to control what is happening around</text>
  <text start="565.87" dur="9.6">the world and it does push governments</text>
  <text start="570.73" dur="9">to create certain laws the central bank</text>
  <text start="575.47" dur="6.69">is where we all should be looking and of</text>
  <text start="579.73" dur="4.02">course what they do is they make you</text>
  <text start="582.16" dur="4.27">look someplace else</text>
  <text start="583.75" dur="6.46">they make you fight amongst each other</text>
  <text start="586.43" dur="5.61">they make everyone believe that they</text>
  <text start="590.21" dur="4.68">have nothing to do with any of this</text>
  <text start="592.04" dur="4.5">that&amp;#39;s the beauty of their assistant Ron</text>
  <text start="594.89" dur="3.3">saying their system is great I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="596.54" dur="5.12">this is how their systems been working</text>
  <text start="598.19" dur="6.3">for many many many many many years and</text>
  <text start="601.66" dur="4.54">right now because of the internet</text>
  <text start="604.49" dur="4.23">because of everything else people are</text>
  <text start="606.2" dur="5.13">waking up to what the central banking</text>
  <text start="608.72" dur="3.96">system has done and people are starting</text>
  <text start="611.33" dur="4.41">to realize because of critical</text>
  <text start="612.68" dur="5.19">currencies that we don&amp;#39;t really need the</text>
  <text start="615.74" dur="5.25">central bank there&amp;#39;s no reason for it I</text>
  <text start="617.87" dur="7.14">mean they can create currency it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="620.99" dur="7.11">mind it doesn&amp;#39;t took extra power it</text>
  <text start="625.01" dur="5.94">doesn&amp;#39;t take time to create the currency</text>
  <text start="628.1" dur="5.96">their currency is just push a button and</text>
  <text start="630.95" dur="6.21">there it is poof it just appears</text>
  <text start="634.06" dur="5.649">yes cryptocurrency same thing but it</text>
  <text start="637.16" dur="6.59">takes a lot of energy and it takes a lot</text>
  <text start="639.709" dur="8.94">of time to create the cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="643.75" dur="7.99">completely different and we see that the</text>
  <text start="648.649" dur="6.121">central banking system they are a</text>
  <text start="651.74" dur="6.08">private company everything they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="654.77" dur="5.85">is hidden in secrecy</text>
  <text start="657.82" dur="7.48">compared to cryptocurrency which is out</text>
  <text start="660.62" dur="6.36">in the open you know that you know</text>
  <text start="665.3" dur="4.86">what&amp;#39;s going on first of all there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="666.98" dur="6.12">one centralized individual working this</text>
  <text start="670.16" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s spread out in all different areas</text>
  <text start="673.1" dur="4.56">the coins are created by many</text>
  <text start="675.17" dur="5.97">individuals it&amp;#39;s not set by one</text>
  <text start="677.66" dur="5.7">government by one group this is very</text>
  <text start="681.14" dur="5.67">very different this is why they</text>
  <text start="683.36" dur="10.29">continually push the idea that crypto</text>
  <text start="686.81" dur="9.42">currencies are not currency they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="693.65" dur="4.62">good to hold they&amp;#39;re used by criminals</text>
  <text start="696.23" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re used by terrorists think about</text>
  <text start="698.27" dur="5.939">when the finance system came online back</text>
  <text start="701.42" dur="5.789">in 1971 they created the paper market</text>
  <text start="704.209" dur="5.491">like we said before they demonized gold</text>
  <text start="707.209" dur="4.951">and silver they said it was a barbarous</text>
  <text start="709.7" dur="4.86">relic and they told people you didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="712.16" dur="4.77">have to hold it what do they do in a</text>
  <text start="714.56" dur="4.74">cryptocurrency right now seems like the</text>
  <text start="716.93" dur="3.36">same exact thing now they&amp;#39;re doing it</text>
  <text start="719.3" dur="2.339">with gold and so</text>
  <text start="720.29" dur="3.87">and they&amp;#39;re doing it with cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="721.639" dur="4.44">they created a paper market they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="724.16" dur="3.329">telling you there&amp;#39;s no reason to have</text>
  <text start="726.079" dur="6.141">cryptocurrencies it&amp;#39;s not really a</text>
  <text start="727.489" dur="8.07">currency criminals use it it&amp;#39;s volatile</text>
  <text start="732.22" dur="6.519">you&amp;#39;re better off with our finance</text>
  <text start="735.559" dur="6.75">system they&amp;#39;re doing the same exact</text>
  <text start="738.739" dur="4.981">thing look at their patterns this is</text>
