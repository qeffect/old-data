  <text start="169.9" dur="7.169">manipulated numbers now we understand</text>
  <text start="172.989" dur="6.511">with Obama he&amp;#39;s bringing in illegals</text>

  <text start="199.299" dur="3.991">hit with a three-thousand-dollar penalty</text>
  <text start="201.069" dur="4.14">there&amp;#39;s many different agendas with</text>
  <text start="203.29" dur="3.75">bringing in these illegals and we</text>
  <text start="205.209" dur="4.981">understand that there&amp;#39;s a US District</text>
  <text start="207.04" dur="4.669">Judge Andrew hainan he had an injunction</text>
  <text start="210.19" dur="4.98">holding President Obama&amp;#39;s executive</text>
  <text start="211.709" dur="5.801">amnesty program but it looks like Obama</text>
  <text start="215.17" dur="4.74">doesn&amp;#39;t care about what the judge says</text>
  <text start="217.51" dur="4.229">because he&amp;#39;s continually with the help</text>
  <text start="219.91" dur="6.2">of Department of Homeland Security they</text>
  <text start="221.739" dur="8.671">have issued more than another 2,000 a</text>
  <text start="226.11" dur="7.209">job or work permits and these are three</text>
  <text start="230.41" dur="5.639">year work permits so basically he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="233.319" dur="6.181">following the law what&amp;#39;s over he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="236.049" dur="7.56">by passing it completely and of course</text>
  <text start="239.5" dur="6.209">if you realize and notice this that our</text>
  <text start="243.609" dur="3.481">government officials their government</text>
  <text start="245.709" dur="3.511">leaders if you like the call on that</text>
  <text start="247.09" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re not even leaders but they like</text>
  <text start="249.22" dur="6.239">to tell us that we are a land of law the</text>
  <text start="251.92" dur="7.14">rule of law but it&amp;#39;s only for the people</text>
  <text start="255.459" dur="5.34">they don&amp;#39;t like following the laws they</text>
  <text start="259.06" dur="4.29">say whoa whoa well the reason we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="260.799" dur="4.861">following it is because of you know so</text>
  <text start="263.35" dur="5.7">and so but you need to follow the law</text>
  <text start="265.66" dur="6.42">and a judge says no you cannot issue</text>
  <text start="269.05" dur="6.839">more work permits but he doesn&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="272.08" dur="7.74">and he&amp;#39;s continually doing this we</text>

  <text start="359.879" dur="5.47">the p5 plus 1 deal is moving forward but</text>
  <text start="363.729" dur="4.14">there are certain government officials</text>

  <text start="387.039" dur="4.951">which is used to drill oil wells</text>
  <text start="389.11" dur="6.739">therefore break breaking the use the</text>
  <text start="391.99" dur="6.75">u.s. monopoly in the field of doing this</text>
  <text start="395.849" dur="5.22">the Iranian experts at the Ministry of</text>

  <text start="406.389" dur="6.93">technology which has so far been used by</text>
  <text start="409.3" dur="7.079">only the United States and we can see if</text>
  <text start="413.319" dur="4.35">these sanctions are ever lifted or even</text>
  <text start="416.379" dur="4.26">if the United States doesn&amp;#39;t lift the</text>
  <text start="417.669" dur="4.381">sanctions other countries are going to</text>
  <text start="420.639" dur="2.851">do business with them and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="422.05" dur="4.619">to leave the United States out of this</text>
  <text start="423.49" dur="5.759">and again we&amp;#39;ve seen that these</text>
  <text start="426.669" dur="5.011">sanctions against different countries</text>
  <text start="429.249" dur="3.211">they don&amp;#39;t work there obsolete today</text>
  <text start="431.68" dur="2.76">because</text>
  <text start="432.46" dur="5.07">a lot of the countries are using their</text>
  <text start="434.44" dur="5.46">own currencies this is why we&amp;#39;re the</text>

  <text start="457.24" dur="6.75">their own currency they could care less</text>
  <text start="460.919" dur="5.111">we see that the sound led coalition they</text>
  <text start="463.99" dur="4.799">launched airstrikes on the Yemen of CAP</text>
  <text start="466.03" dur="5.55">the Yemen capitals airport they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="475" dur="3.24">continually bombing the area they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="477.009" dur="4.171">doing it on purpose because they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="478.24" dur="5.459">want humanitarian aid coming in but we</text>
  <text start="481.18" dur="5.669">see right now that humanitarian aid is</text>
  <text start="483.699" dur="6.06">coming into the area Iran is planning to</text>
  <text start="486.849" dur="6.421">send a ship with humanitarian cargo to</text>

  <text start="504.009" dur="4.621">humanitarian aid now we have to watch</text>
  <text start="505.419" dur="4.441">the situation very closely because as we</text>
  <text start="508.63" dur="3.81">know the United States government</text>
  <text start="509.86" dur="4.559">central bankers they might see these</text>
  <text start="512.44" dur="5.25">ships coming in once again and say that</text>
  <text start="514.419" dur="6.091">over they have arms for the Hootie&amp;#39;s we</text>

  <text start="549.31" dur="3.36">becoming was under a lot of pressure</text>
  <text start="551.23" dur="3.87">because they were not allowing any</text>
  <text start="552.67" dur="4.53">humanitarian aid in and the people there</text>
  <text start="555.1" dur="4.08">in Yemen were suffering but this was the</text>
  <text start="557.2" dur="4.02">point of the whole thing the Houthi</text>
