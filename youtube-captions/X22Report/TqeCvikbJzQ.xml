  <text start="88.89" dur="6.479">to be way down the unemployment rate is</text>
  <text start="92.31" dur="6.39">at four point nine percent we see that</text>
  <text start="95.369" dur="7.5">they&amp;#39;re pushing the idea that GDP is</text>
  <text start="98.7" dur="8.4">bouncing back now and what they do is</text>
  <text start="102.869" dur="8.521">they set all of this up for the great</text>
  <text start="107.1" dur="6.269">fall for the great collapse and what</text>
  <text start="111.39" dur="4.95">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that corporations right</text>
  <text start="113.369" dur="5.431">now they&amp;#39;re laying off more and more</text>
  <text start="116.34" dur="5.309">employees it&amp;#39;s not like a hundred here</text>
  <text start="118.8" dur="4.5">or 200 there we&amp;#39;re talking thousands of</text>
  <text start="121.649" dur="4.98">people think about a Volkswagen right</text>
  <text start="123.3" dur="5.849">now they&amp;#39;re gonna be laying off 30,000</text>
  <text start="126.629" dur="5.031">people by 2020 well we&amp;#39;re coming up on</text>
  <text start="129.149" dur="6.691">2017 now so it&amp;#39;s three years that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="131.66" dur="7.27">10,000 people a year that&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="135.84" dur="5.149">people Pennsylvania labor industry</text>
  <text start="138.93" dur="6.69">department they&amp;#39;re gonna be laying off</text>
  <text start="140.989" dur="10.681">600 employees and when we look past and</text>
  <text start="145.62" dur="8.16">look at 2016 we see there were a lot of</text>
  <text start="151.67" dur="3.55">individuals laid off and we have to</text>
  <text start="153.78" dur="4.59">remember something very important here</text>
  <text start="155.22" dur="4.14">for all those stores that are closing</text>
  <text start="158.37" dur="4.02">and they have all these part-time</text>
  <text start="159.36" dur="5.459">workers we have to remember how they</text>
  <text start="162.39" dur="5.45">count them because when they&amp;#39;re laid off</text>
  <text start="164.819" dur="6.03">and they&amp;#39;re removed from their positions</text>
  <text start="167.84" dur="4.509">they&amp;#39;re not counted as a layoff now of</text>
  <text start="170.849" dur="2.791">course they look at their number of</text>
  <text start="172.349" dur="2.881">hours that they work and they look at</text>
  <text start="173.64" dur="3.69">how much they get paid and if it&amp;#39;s under</text>
  <text start="175.23" dur="3.78">I think 30 hours or so every state is</text>
  <text start="177.33" dur="4.29">different they don&amp;#39;t count them as a</text>
  <text start="179.01" dur="5.58">layoff so they can&amp;#39;t collect what</text>
  <text start="181.62" dur="5.429">unemployment but when they get hired as</text>
  <text start="184.59" dur="6.06">a part-time they&amp;#39;re counted as a</text>
  <text start="187.049" dur="7.11">full-time employee so you can see how</text>
  <text start="190.65" dur="5.3">the double standard works here and what</text>
  <text start="194.159" dur="5.64">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this huge</text>
  <text start="195.95" dur="7.72">buildup of the economy the central</text>
  <text start="199.799" dur="6.75">bankers plan is to build this economy up</text>
  <text start="203.67" dur="5.67">and make it look like it is absolutely</text>
  <text start="206.549" dur="4.86">fine this is why the Treasury secretary</text>
  <text start="209.34" dur="4.47">Jack Lew was out there saying that Obama</text>
  <text start="211.409" dur="5.071">did a fantastic job the economy has</text>
  <text start="213.81" dur="7.5">recovered unbelievable we are out of the</text>
  <text start="216.48" dur="8.24">woods this is a complete set up we see</text>
  <text start="221.31" dur="6.33">right now since Obama has been in office</text>
  <text start="224.72" dur="6.519">well he&amp;#39;s added something like ten</text>
  <text start="227.64" dur="7.23">trillion dollars to the debt it will hit</text>
  <text start="231.239" dur="8.851">20 trillion most likely in January of</text>
  <text start="234.87" dur="9.149">2017 he just hit a record shattering two</text>
  <text start="240.09" dur="8.97">point four trillion dollars of debt this</text>
  <text start="244.019" dur="8.521">year I mean this is unbelievable</text>
  <text start="249.06" dur="6.69">we&amp;#39;ve added more debt then when the</text>
  <text start="252.54" dur="4.949">Federal Reserve came into power in 1913</text>
  <text start="255.75" dur="5.239">in these last eight years we added more</text>
  <text start="257.489" dur="8.311">debt and the numbers always look great</text>
  <text start="260.989" dur="8.321">right before a crash its quarterly</text>
  <text start="265.8" dur="5.01">report time for US stocks and if you</text>
  <text start="269.31" dur="4.229">just casually glance at the earnings</text>
  <text start="270.81" dur="5.1">news you might think companies have had</text>
  <text start="273.539" dur="5.341">a great year many that many of them are</text>
  <text start="275.91" dur="7.05">beating expectations and reporting</text>
  <text start="278.88" dur="5.52">impressive revenues and profits and the</text>
  <text start="282.96" dur="4.23">markets reward companies for meeting</text>
  <text start="284.4" dur="5.76">expectations but the reality is that the</text>
  <text start="287.19" dur="7.13">sp500 is on track for the sixth straight</text>
  <text start="290.16" dur="7.439">drop in a year-over-year earnings in</text>
  <text start="294.32" dur="4.87">2015 estimates went from initial</text>
  <text start="297.599" dur="4.561">forecasts of a hundred and thirty seven</text>
  <text start="299.19" dur="7.31">dollars to barely 100 by the end of the</text>
  <text start="302.16" dur="7.439">year that is a huge mess over 30 percent</text>
  <text start="306.5" dur="5.14">but that dive didn&amp;#39;t dismay the analysts</text>
  <text start="309.599" dur="4.201">because they initially predicted roughly</text>
  <text start="311.64" dur="2.839">the same level of earnings for 2016 and</text>
  <text start="313.8" dur="2.69">as</text>
  <text start="314.479" dur="3.75">September 30th it looked as though the</text>
  <text start="316.49" dur="4.56">earnings are going to come in at roughly</text>
  <text start="318.229" dur="6.511">about a hundred and ten dollars for 2017</text>
  <text start="321.05" dur="7.47">earnings prediction started above 140 an</text>
  <text start="324.74" dur="6">hour down 232 in a world where GDP</text>
  <text start="328.52" dur="7.53">growth may be in the neighborhood of</text>
  <text start="330.74" dur="7.889">about 2% do you think it makes sense or</text>
  <text start="336.05" dur="5.509">any type of sense that earnings are</text>
  <text start="338.629" dur="7.051">going to grow by 20% in 2017</text>
  <text start="341.559" dur="6.64">absolutely not this lie that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="345.68" dur="5.519">continually throwing at us this is an</text>
  <text start="348.199" dur="6.81">illusion it&amp;#39;s going to lead us to</text>
  <text start="351.199" dur="7.77">another 2008 event or a 1929 event or</text>
  <text start="355.009" dur="7.19">something much much worse and we can see</text>
  <text start="358.969" dur="7.051">right now that all of this is one giant</text>
  <text start="362.199" dur="7.84">illusion to keep everyone in the dark</text>
  <text start="366.02" dur="6.119">and when these individuals talk about</text>
  <text start="370.039" dur="5.43">price to earnings ratios the p/e ratio</text>
  <text start="372.139" dur="5.37">being roughly 20 today they are using</text>
  <text start="375.469" dur="5.73">operating earnings in their calculations</text>
  <text start="377.509" dur="6.03">they used if they used reported earnings</text>
  <text start="381.199" dur="5.4">they would find that the p/e ratio is</text>
  <text start="383.539" dur="6.78">roughly 20 for a 20 percent difference</text>
  <text start="386.599" dur="6.421">and certainly up in nosebleed territory</text>
  <text start="390.319" dur="7.231">today&amp;#39;s p/e is twenty six point seven</text>
  <text start="393.02" dur="9.6">nine that is back up in 2007 range and</text>
  <text start="397.55" dur="9.57">it was exceeded only in the year of 2000</text>
  <text start="402.62" dur="6.299">and 1929 so we can see there continually</text>
  <text start="407.12" dur="3.15">keeping this illusion great they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="408.919" dur="5.071">keeping the numbers looking fantastic</text>
  <text start="410.27" dur="8.939">and we know what happened during these</text>
  <text start="413.99" dur="8.82">years everything fell apart we see</text>
  <text start="419.209" dur="6.721">Sweden is out there and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="422.81" dur="7.71">be looking to go all digital they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="425.93" dur="6.989">going to change from paper currency to</text>
  <text start="430.52" dur="4.29">digital currency yes I know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="432.919" dur="3.27">mostly digital right now but it looks</text>
  <text start="434.81" dur="4.829">like they&amp;#39;re taking it to the next level</text>
  <text start="436.189" dur="6.15">and in the next two years or so what</text>
  <text start="439.639" dur="6.75">they want to do is they want to go</text>
  <text start="442.339" dur="5.271">completely all digital and their nuke</text>
  <text start="446.389" dur="5.15">the digital car</text>
  <text start="447.61" dur="6.839">is gonna be called the krona so we see</text>
  <text start="451.539" dur="5.63">already that the central banks are</text>
  <text start="454.449" dur="5.701">making their move to go all digital and</text>
  <text start="457.169" dur="5.68">this will again spread to other</text>
  <text start="460.15" dur="3.419">countries because they want to get rid</text>
  <text start="462.849" dur="4.111">of cash</text>
  <text start="463.569" dur="6.03">remember the systems coming down and if</text>
  <text start="466.96" dur="4.079">they can speed this up and get everyone</text>
  <text start="469.599" dur="2.611">into digital currency they don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="471.039" dur="3.271">worry about people taking their funds</text>
  <text start="472.21" dur="5.669">out of the banks they can control it</text>
  <text start="474.31" dur="6.99">they can use the beylin documents now</text>
  <text start="477.879" dur="7.65">Raoul Pal is warning that Trump is going</text>
  <text start="481.3" dur="7.169">to face a recession in 2017 I think he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="485.529" dur="7.051">gonna face a complete and utter collapse</text>
  <text start="488.469" dur="7.5">of the system in 2017 he says since 1910</text>
  <text start="492.58" dur="7.23">the US economy is either in a recession</text>
  <text start="495.969" dur="6.091">or enters a recession within 12 months</text>
  <text start="499.81" dur="7.259">in every single instance at the end of a</text>
  <text start="502.06" dur="6.479">two-term presidency and we can see right</text>
  <text start="507.069" dur="4.53">now we&amp;#39;ve been tracking the economy</text>
  <text start="508.539" dur="7.44">we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on the economy we</text>
  <text start="511.599" dur="7.291">know the economy is fake we know it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="515.979" dur="7.651">illusion many of the indicators are</text>
  <text start="518.89" dur="7.08">equal to or worse than 2008 he said he</text>
  <text start="523.63" dur="5.04">spent some time looking at US recessions</text>
  <text start="525.97" dur="5.67">in general and found that every single</text>
  <text start="528.67" dur="6.27">one occurred during or just after an</text>
  <text start="531.64" dur="6.15">election without exception not every</text>
  <text start="534.94" dur="6.839">single election sees a recession only</text>
  <text start="537.79" dur="7.919">every two-term incumbent change and in</text>
  <text start="541.779" dur="7.771">the last 100 years the recession of 1979</text>
  <text start="545.709" dur="8.671">is the only recession not to occur</text>
  <text start="549.55" dur="7.649">around the election date so we can see</text>
  <text start="554.38" dur="4.68">right now that the central banker is the</text>
  <text start="557.199" dur="4.801">shadow government if they don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="559.06" dur="6.99">their way they&amp;#39;re going to be very angry</text>
  <text start="562" dur="6.72">and they&amp;#39;re gonna be pissed off and they</text>
  <text start="566.05" dur="3.93">want Trump to look bad we could see</text>
  <text start="568.72" dur="3.859">throughout the corporate media right now</text>
  <text start="569.98" dur="6.359">they&amp;#39;re bashing him at every turn</text>
  <text start="572.579" dur="6.161">because right now they really thought</text>
  <text start="576.339" dur="4.8">that Hillary was going to be elected and</text>
  <text start="578.74" dur="5.309">they&amp;#39;re continually keeping a</text>
  <text start="581.139" dur="5.82">pressure on everything that he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="584.049" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re not letting up we see George</text>
  <text start="586.959" dur="5.28">Soros is still having the protesters out</text>
  <text start="589.209" dur="7.65">there March in the streets because they</text>
  <text start="592.239" dur="7.2">want a divided country and we know come</text>
  <text start="596.859" dur="5.19">next year if he makes it through the</text>
  <text start="599.439" dur="5.911">inauguration and everything else they</text>
  <text start="602.049" dur="5.58">will bring down this economy most likely</text>
  <text start="605.35" dur="4.649">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is they&amp;#39;ll start</text>
  <text start="607.629" dur="6.39">reporting on the economy saying that</text>
  <text start="609.999" dur="5.4">things are not doing well since Trump</text>
  <text start="614.019" dur="4.141">has taken office</text>
  <text start="615.399" dur="5.28">a month has gone by some of his policies</text>
  <text start="618.16" dur="4.679">are not working well and the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="620.679" dur="4.051">slipping a little bit another month</text>
  <text start="622.839" dur="4.55">might go by they might say the economy</text>
  <text start="624.73" dur="4.229">is getting worse they&amp;#39;ll have you know</text>
  <text start="627.389" dur="4.24">individuals that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="628.959" dur="4.35">interview they&amp;#39;ll tell us that you know</text>
  <text start="631.629" dur="4.74">we could be heading towards some type of</text>
  <text start="633.309" dur="4.32">recession looking at the data we can see</text>
  <text start="636.369" dur="2.52">that things are starting to break down</text>
  <text start="637.629" dur="2.911">you know all the things that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="638.889" dur="3.51">talking about all along they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="640.54" dur="3.299">start bringing them up and then</text>
  <text start="642.399" dur="3.54">eventually what will happen is the stock</text>
  <text start="643.839" dur="4.821">market will come down and they&amp;#39;ll say</text>
  <text start="645.939" dur="5.49">see everything that he wanted to do with</text>
  <text start="648.66" dur="6.25">bringing factories back to the country</text>
  <text start="651.429" dur="6.03">with taxes his whole economic policy it</text>
  <text start="654.91" dur="7.44">brought down the economy but we know</text>
  <text start="657.459" dur="6.57">better we understood we looked at the</text>
  <text start="662.35" dur="3.419">information we&amp;#39;ve been following it</text>
  <text start="664.029" dur="4.381">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking it we know exactly</text>
  <text start="665.769" dur="6.54">what they&amp;#39;re up to we know exactly what</text>
  <text start="668.41" dur="5.69">they&amp;#39;re going to pull and most likely we</text>
  <text start="672.309" dur="4.83">can see we&amp;#39;re heading down this path and</text>
  <text start="674.1" dur="5.319">from this research of Raoul Powell we</text>
  <text start="677.139" dur="4.23">can see right now that well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="679.419" dur="3.45">heading towards a recession which I</text>
  <text start="681.369" dur="3.39">believe is going to be a major major</text>
