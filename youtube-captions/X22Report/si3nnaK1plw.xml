  <text start="117.62" dur="6.42">and this there this is the beginning</text>
  <text start="120.62" dur="8.24">stages of them setting it up for some</text>
  <text start="124.04" dur="8.1">type of false flag to get the gun bills</text>
  <text start="128.86" dur="7.54">that are pending in the Senate to be</text>
  <text start="132.14" dur="8.239">passed and this is why this</text>
  <text start="136.4" dur="8.009">the thing was brought out right now now</text>
  <text start="140.379" dur="6.911">in California Senate approves 8 gun</text>
  <text start="144.409" dur="5.341">control bills including ammo registry</text>
  <text start="147.29" dur="4.32">and I do have a video and this was in</text>
  <text start="149.75" dur="5.129">The Sentinel alerts that also a sheriff</text>
  <text start="151.61" dur="6.299">sheriff spoke about this and here let me</text>
  <text start="154.879" dur="5.041">just read some of these to you a ban on</text>
  <text start="157.909" dur="4.44">standard capacity magazines that hold</text>
  <text start="159.92" dur="4.59">more than 10 rounds a bill that places</text>
  <text start="162.349" dur="5.491">erroneous restrictions on bullet buttons</text>
  <text start="164.51" dur="6.33">I build that would reclassify certain</text>
  <text start="167.84" dur="4.549">shotguns as assault weapons a bill that</text>
  <text start="170.84" dur="6.259">required all gun buyers to take a</text>
  <text start="172.389" dur="11.111">firearm safety certification class and</text>
  <text start="177.099" dur="9.371">there was another one here the SB 374</text>
  <text start="183.5" dur="4.889">which as the NRA noted essentially bans</text>
  <text start="186.47" dur="3.75">the sale purchase manufacturer virtually</text>
  <text start="188.389" dur="4.201">all semi-automatic rimfire centerfire</text>
  <text start="190.22" dur="3.75">rifles that then have a fixed magazine</text>
  <text start="192.59" dur="3.989">and requires those who currently own</text>
  <text start="193.97" dur="6.09">such firearms to register them register</text>
  <text start="196.579" dur="6.66">them with the state and also they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="200.06" dur="5.25">saying that ammo vendors would be</text>
  <text start="203.239" dur="5.011">required to obtain special permits to</text>
  <text start="205.31" dur="8.609">sell ammunition and they also want the</text>
  <text start="208.25" dur="9.389">ammunition registered so basically a</text>
  <text start="213.919" dur="5.871">sheriff came out and told this hearing</text>
  <text start="217.639" dur="6.18">that it is completely unconstitutional</text>
  <text start="219.79" dur="7">it is if and I like the way he did this</text>
  <text start="223.819" dur="4.741">that it&amp;#39;s infringing upon the Second</text>
  <text start="226.79" dur="6.119">Amendment and I said this over and over</text>
  <text start="228.56" dur="6.03">but the right to bear arms is bear is</text>
  <text start="232.909" dur="5.64">carry arms as weapons ammunition</text>
  <text start="234.59" dur="7.709">armament armament is military weaponry</text>
  <text start="238.549" dur="7.821">and infringe is to limit to encroach on</text>
  <text start="242.299" dur="7.231">to undermine so the sheriff came out and</text>
  <text start="246.37" dur="6.64">said that you are infringing all of</text>
  <text start="249.53" dur="5.76">these laws are infringing on the Second</text>
  <text start="253.01" dur="4.589">Amendment and he is completely right</text>
  <text start="255.29" dur="5.509">they are infringing on the Second</text>
  <text start="257.599" dur="5.641">Amendment these laws are null and void</text>
  <text start="260.799" dur="6.43">according to the Constitution and the</text>
  <text start="263.24" dur="6.6">Bill of Rights Second Amendment boom our</text>
  <text start="267.229" dur="4.561">founding fathers made it so simple that</text>
  <text start="269.84" dur="4.68">you can&amp;#39;t really screw it up but guess</text>
  <text start="271.79" dur="4.86">what no one pays attention no one knows</text>
  <text start="274.52" dur="5.72">our Bill of Rights nobody knows what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="276.65" dur="7.56">going on so they just go along with it</text>
  <text start="280.24" dur="9.16">okay let&amp;#39;s move on here now I see DHS</text>
  <text start="284.21" dur="8.22">has put in to purchase more ammunition</text>
  <text start="289.4" dur="6.09">and it looks like they&amp;#39;re buying all</text>
  <text start="292.43" dur="4.26">different types of rounds you know 4,000</text>
  <text start="295.49" dur="5.33">rounds of thousand rounds and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="296.69" dur="8.37">buying the 45 long colt they&amp;#39;re buying</text>
  <text start="300.82" dur="7.03">you know 22 long rifle and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="305.06" dur="6.99">buying many different types of rounds of</text>
  <text start="307.85" dur="5.94">ammunition and again the only reason</text>
  <text start="312.05" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re / what are they what do they</text>
  <text start="313.79" dur="4.5">need this for because if they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="316.34" dur="2.97">a terrorist organization to stop</text>
  <text start="318.29" dur="3.27">terrorists well first of all they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="319.31" dur="4.05">doing a terrible job second of all they</text>
  <text start="321.56" dur="2.94">never have any terrorist alert so why do</text>
  <text start="323.36" dur="2.76">they need the ammunition if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="324.5" dur="2.97">never a terrorist alert on their on</text>
  <text start="326.12" dur="4.049">their website what do you need the</text>
  <text start="327.47" dur="5.88">ammunition for they had no idea that</text>
  <text start="330.169" dur="4.321">that the Boston bombing thing was going</text>
  <text start="333.35" dur="3.24">to happen even though that was set up</text>
  <text start="334.49" dur="3.66">and that&amp;#39;s why they did have an idea but</text>
  <text start="336.59" dur="4.38">they couldn&amp;#39;t say anything because they</text>
  <text start="338.15" dur="4.65">were behind it with everyone else but</text>
  <text start="340.97" dur="6.29">they had no clue didn&amp;#39;t even come out or</text>
  <text start="342.8" dur="7.41">anything they are not in put in place to</text>
  <text start="347.26" dur="7.029">capture the terrorists they are put in</text>
  <text start="350.21" dur="7.05">place to spy on Americans with their</text>
  <text start="354.289" dur="7.011">fusion centers to control Americans</text>
  <text start="357.26" dur="7.14">before during and after the collapse and</text>
  <text start="361.3" dur="4.51">this is the special police force of the</text>
  <text start="364.4" dur="3.54">federal government that has nothing to</text>
  <text start="365.81" dur="6.09">do with the military that can work with</text>
  <text start="367.94" dur="8.49">local law enforcement to keep order and</text>
  <text start="371.9" dur="9.86">to keep people locked in during martial</text>
  <text start="376.43" dur="8.94">law that is all they&amp;#39;re here for and</text>
  <text start="381.76" dur="5.589">okay now let&amp;#39;s move on here now there</text>
  <text start="385.37" dur="5.4">was a cyber attack that targeted</text>
  <text start="387.349" dur="5.221">Australia spy headquarters and it goes</text>
  <text start="390.77" dur="3.959">on to say despite sophisticated cyber</text>
  <text start="392.57" dur="4.62">defenses the layout and location of</text>
  <text start="394.729" dur="4.5">computer networks inside can embarrass</text>
  <text start="397.19" dur="5.61">spy agency are now reportedly in the</text>
  <text start="399.229" dur="4.481">hands of hackers and again they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="402.8" dur="4.54">building their case</text>
  <text start="403.71" dur="6.84">and I know I talk about America having a</text>
  <text start="407.34" dur="6.29">cyber attack but other countries will</text>
  <text start="410.55" dur="5.73">also have cyber attacks and this is</text>
  <text start="413.63" dur="6.6">basically all the western central</text>
  <text start="416.28" dur="8.4">bankers it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a way to get everyone</text>
  <text start="420.23" dur="8.14">the last ditch attempt and to get</text>
  <text start="424.68" dur="8.67">everyone angry up in arms and have them</text>
  <text start="428.37" dur="6.9">go to war steal their money steal the</text>
  <text start="433.35" dur="4.53">people&amp;#39;s money from the banks why the</text>
  <text start="435.27" dur="6.33">cyber attacks are happening declare</text>
  <text start="437.88" dur="6.21">martial law in cities and in many</text>
  <text start="441.6" dur="5.94">different jurisdictions and to keep the</text>
  <text start="444.09" dur="6.3">power out for a prolonged period of time</text>
  <text start="447.54" dur="7.41">so the people get very angry and</text>
  <text start="450.39" dur="6.63">actually push to go to war and this is</text>
  <text start="454.95" dur="3.45">the reason for these type of cyber</text>
  <text start="457.02" dur="3.06">attacks and this is why they keep</text>
  <text start="458.4" dur="3.15">bringing it up because they want</text>
  <text start="460.08" dur="3.65">everyone to know about it they want</text>
  <text start="461.55" dur="5.67">everyone to keep hearing it it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="463.73" dur="6.93">incremental brainwashing day after day</text>
  <text start="467.22" dur="6.48">after week after months after a year and</text>
  <text start="470.66" dur="5.11">before you know it the government will</text>
  <text start="473.7" dur="4.44">say we told you about this we warned you</text>
  <text start="475.77" dur="5.01">and look what happened now we&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="478.14" dur="8.22">attacked and you know look look what</text>
  <text start="480.78" dur="7.47">happened to her everybody here so and it</text>
  <text start="486.36" dur="4.23">won&amp;#39;t just happen here in America it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="488.25" dur="4.68">going to happen in Europe it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="490.59" dur="4.83">happen in Australia it&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="492.93" dur="6.9">here in America it&amp;#39;s going to happen in</text>
  <text start="495.42" dur="8.46">many many places it&amp;#39;ll happen in Japan</text>
  <text start="499.83" dur="6.21">and this is to get the people behind the</text>
  <text start="503.88" dur="6.09">government which is controlled by the</text>
  <text start="506.04" dur="7.41">central bankers to get them all rallied</text>
  <text start="509.97" dur="7.59">up to start this World War so they can</text>
  <text start="513.45" dur="6.53">cover their big big collapse of what is</text>
  <text start="517.56" dur="6.14">coming and they know it and right now as</text>
  <text start="519.98" dur="7.21">you can see the stock market is going up</text>
  <text start="523.7" dur="6.55">people think the real estate market I</text>
  <text start="527.19" dur="6.96">mean I have people friends and relatives</text>
  <text start="530.25" dur="6.93">who are now looking at homes who are</text>
  <text start="534.15" dur="4.65">looking to upgrade into a better house</text>
  <text start="537.18" dur="4.26">and these are the people that still have</text>
  <text start="538.8" dur="4.5">their jobs no reduction salary still</text>
  <text start="541.44" dur="3.21">making the same amount and they feel</text>
  <text start="543.3" dur="4.59">like the interest rates are very low</text>
  <text start="544.65" dur="7.35">right now and the housing market is</text>
  <text start="547.89" dur="7.65">booming and now it&amp;#39;s time to move into a</text>
  <text start="552" dur="5.64">more expensive home which I personally</text>
  <text start="555.54" dur="5.55">think is they were smooth but when you</text>
  <text start="557.64" dur="5.94">try to tell people this it&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="561.09" dur="6.15">difficult because the no one&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="563.58" dur="8.04">listen listen back in 2004-2005 if you</text>
  <text start="567.24" dur="6.87">weren&amp;#39;t awake 2006-2007 and you weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="571.62" dur="4.53">awake you were buying a home you you</text>
  <text start="574.11" dur="4.2">were thinking everything&amp;#39;s perfect</text>

  <text start="583.56" dur="7.92">looking great and this is the calm right</text>
  <text start="588.24" dur="5.82">before it tumbles and this is what</text>
  <text start="591.48" dur="4.65">everyone is experiencing it&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="594.06" dur="4.47">Peter Schiff I have to say it&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="596.13" dur="5.58">junkie we just gave everyone the drug</text>
  <text start="598.53" dur="4.98">and the Fed is drugging everyone and</text>
  <text start="601.71" dur="4.68">everyone&amp;#39;s feeling the high right now</text>
  <text start="603.51" dur="5.99">but sooner or later the drug wears off</text>
  <text start="606.39" dur="8.64">and everything comes crashing down and</text>
  <text start="609.5" dur="8.05">people will then feel it and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="615.03" dur="4.1">going to be a crash people will feel it</text>
  <text start="617.55" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;ll give a little bit more drug</text>
  <text start="619.13" dur="5.38">they&amp;#39;ll feel high again and then boom</text>
  <text start="621.99" dur="7.44">another crash and this is when people</text>
  <text start="624.51" dur="8.43">are going to really not understand what</text>
  <text start="629.43" dur="6.56">is going on I mean we&amp;#39;re seeing suicides</text>
  <text start="632.94" dur="6.72">now the suicide rate is going to triple</text>
  <text start="635.99" dur="6.88">when this major crash hits people are</text>
  <text start="639.66" dur="5.75">not going to know what to do when this</text>
  <text start="642.87" dur="6.03">happens people are going to starve</text>
  <text start="645.41" dur="10.06">people are going to be homeless people</text>
  <text start="648.9" dur="10.26">are are going to you know Rob steal food</text>
  <text start="655.47" dur="5.04">break into homes it really is not going</text>
  <text start="659.16" dur="3.84">to be a pretty scene I mean if you look</text>
  <text start="660.51" dur="4.02">back at the Great Depression the amount</text>
  <text start="663" dur="4.02">of people that were homeless the amount</text>
  <text start="664.53" dur="4.65">of ten cities the amount of people that</text>
  <text start="667.02" dur="3.93">would do anything to feed their family</text>
  <text start="669.18" dur="3.9">the same thing is going to</text>
  <text start="670.95" dur="10.88">but now and especially when the dollar</text>
  <text start="673.08" dur="8.75">is no longer the reserve currency and</text>
  <text start="682.34" dur="10.57">Americans have to experience what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="686.13" dur="9.06">like not to be on top it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="692.91" dur="4.98">very very difficult for a lot of people</text>
  <text start="695.19" dur="4.68">i mean i&amp;#39;ve seen it with people i seen</text>
  <text start="697.89" dur="5.64">the way they react when a small little</text>
  <text start="699.87" dur="6.51">glitch in their everyday lives what when</text>
  <text start="703.53" dur="4.8">it happens they can&amp;#39;t handle it and this</text>
  <text start="706.38" dur="5.58">is not a small little glitch this is</text>
  <text start="708.33" dur="8.42">something that&amp;#39;s huge and people will</text>
  <text start="711.96" dur="8.42">not be able to handle what is coming but</text>
  <text start="716.75" dur="7.09">there was an interesting article about</text>
  <text start="720.38" dur="5.53">ten things government can do that would</text>
  <text start="723.84" dur="7.68">land you in jail now these are things</text>
  <text start="725.91" dur="11.97">that government can do but you can&amp;#39;t so</text>
  <text start="731.52" dur="7.65">now this article goes on to say you know</text>
  <text start="737.88" dur="3.39">do you still believe the government</text>
  <text start="739.17" dur="3.6">represents the people are you part of</text>
  <text start="741.27" dur="4.92">the majority that generally wants the</text>
  <text start="742.77" dur="6.18">government to do good things now what</text>
  <text start="746.19" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re saying here spying citizens are</text>
  <text start="748.95" dur="4.44">also increasingly being arrested for</text>
  <text start="750.54" dur="5.85">filming police or public buildings under</text>
  <text start="753.39" dur="6.48">wiretapping charges of all things but</text>
  <text start="756.39" dur="5.88">guess what under the law the government</text>
  <text start="759.87" dur="6.69">is allowed to spy on you without</text>
  <text start="762.27" dur="6.78">warrants or anything like that insider</text>
  <text start="766.56" dur="7.83">trading yes you will serve jail time</text>
