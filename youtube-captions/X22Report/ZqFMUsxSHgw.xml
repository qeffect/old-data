  <text start="230.65" dur="5.49">trying to put a spin on this like it was</text>
  <text start="232.69" dur="6.15">okay to do this because we were doing it</text>
  <text start="236.14" dur="7.41">for the people so they went into other</text>
  <text start="238.84" dur="7.47">countries and they killed civilians to</text>

  <text start="339.2" dur="3.21">and I would expect some type of an event</text>
  <text start="341.33" dur="3.84">I would expect something to happen</text>
  <text start="342.41" dur="5.19">during this period of time for a major</text>
  <text start="345.17" dur="4.17">distraction because they really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="347.6" dur="4.5">want this information getting out there</text>
  <text start="349.34" dur="5.43">and we&amp;#39;ll have to sit back and wait to</text>
  <text start="352.1" dur="5.4">see what happens we also see that the</text>
  <text start="354.77" dur="7.01">construction of the wall it has started</text>
  <text start="357.5" dur="6.42">and we see that the 14-mile section</text>
  <text start="361.78" dur="4.75">this is the new border wall between</text>
  <text start="363.92" dur="5.97">Mexico and United States will include an</text>
  <text start="366.53" dur="5.28">anti climbing plates to stop individuals</text>
  <text start="369.89" dur="4.17">from climbing the wall the wall is gonna</text>
  <text start="371.81" dur="5.16">be about 18 to 30 feet depending on what</text>
  <text start="374.06" dur="4.53">location it&amp;#39;s at we also see that the</text>
  <text start="376.97" dur="3.45">construction company that was awarded</text>
  <text start="378.59" dur="5.1">all this was a text a Texas based</text>
  <text start="380.42" dur="5.94">construction company SLS CEO was</text>
  <text start="383.69" dur="5.04">recently awarded 147 million dollars to</text>
  <text start="386.36" dur="4.83">construct the wall this was from the 1.6</text>
  <text start="388.73" dur="4.02">billion down payment for a border wall</text>
  <text start="391.19" dur="4.26">that would extend across the nation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="392.75" dur="5.1">southern border and we see right now</text>
  <text start="395.45" dur="5.28">that this is moving forward right now</text>
  <text start="397.85" dur="5.91">and remember this when we go back to the</text>
  <text start="400.73" dur="5.85">Q post this wall is just not a wall for</text>
  <text start="403.76" dur="5.46">illegals this is a wall to stop human</text>
  <text start="406.58" dur="5.16">trafficking this is a wall to stop the</text>
  <text start="409.22" dur="5.61">gun running this is the wall to stop the</text>
  <text start="411.74" dur="6.66">deep state from pushing their agenda</text>
  <text start="414.83" dur="7.08">that&amp;#39;s why the wall is being built we</text>
  <text start="418.4" dur="6.05">see out in Italy everything is changing</text>
  <text start="421.91" dur="5.42">and it looks like the movement is</text>
  <text start="424.45" dur="5.79">accelerating across the globe</text>
  <text start="427.33" dur="5.59">Italy&amp;#39;s anti-immigrant League party</text>
  <text start="430.24" dur="4.24">which on Friday formed a populist</text>
  <text start="432.92" dur="4.44">movement in coalition with a five-star</text>
  <text start="434.48" dur="5.46">party and it was leader Matteo salvini</text>

  <text start="445.28" dur="5.43">hundreds of thousands of illegal</text>
  <text start="447.29" dur="5.66">immigrants salvias League and the five</text>
  <text start="450.71" dur="3.959">star movement struck a deal on a</text>
  <text start="452.95" dur="4.059">coalition government</text>
  <text start="454.669" dur="4.921">we&amp;#39;ll work towards putting Italians</text>
  <text start="457.009" dur="5.791">first I think we&amp;#39;ve heard this before</text>
  <text start="459.59" dur="5.659">where it&amp;#39;s Americans first and now</text>
  <text start="462.8" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re saying these are Italians first</text>
  <text start="465.249" dur="6.79">George Soros well he&amp;#39;s flipping out</text>
  <text start="468.71" dur="5.609">about this and he&amp;#39;s saying this is</text>
  <text start="472.039" dur="5.611">unacceptable we need open borders we</text>
  <text start="474.319" dur="5.521">can&amp;#39;t have countries saying Italy first</text>
  <text start="477.65" dur="4.229">Germany first we can&amp;#39;t have this and</text>
  <text start="479.84" dur="4.409">this is going to spread to other</text>
  <text start="481.879" dur="4.801">countries we&amp;#39;ve seen how the European</text>
  <text start="484.249" dur="4.41">countries reacted to immigrants flowing</text>
  <text start="486.68" dur="6.78">into their countries some countries put</text>
  <text start="488.659" dur="7.38">up fences yes walls and we see right now</text>
  <text start="493.46" dur="4.59">the movement is moving forward we see</text>
  <text start="496.039" dur="6.15">Poland and the Czech Republic have</text>
  <text start="498.05" dur="6.03">resisted sources policies and Italy is</text>
  <text start="502.189" dur="4.081">getting ready to send back hundreds of</text>
  <text start="504.08" dur="3.329">thousands of immigrants and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="506.27" dur="3.06">going to be sending them out of the</text>
  <text start="507.409" dur="3.75">country and I believe this is going to</text>
  <text start="509.33" dur="5.129">spread to every single European country</text>
  <text start="511.159" dur="5.841">because they don&amp;#39;t want to be blended</text>
  <text start="514.459" dur="5.041">and the only reason we have these</text>
  <text start="517" dur="5.169">refugees these illegal immigrants moving</text>
  <text start="519.5" dur="5.279">into these areas is because this is what</text>
  <text start="522.169" dur="5.221">the globalists want think about this for</text>
  <text start="524.779" dur="4.081">a second they disrupted the entire</text>
  <text start="527.39" dur="3.6">Middle East people don&amp;#39;t have a place to</text>
  <text start="528.86" dur="3.63">live so we have all these refugees like</text>
  <text start="530.99" dur="3.15">in Syria there&amp;#39;s like millions of them a</text>
  <text start="532.49" dur="4.02">lot of them are in Lebanon a lot of them</text>
  <text start="534.14" dur="5.73">are in Turkey now that the war is ending</text>
  <text start="536.51" dur="5.699">these individuals can go back home they</text>
  <text start="539.87" dur="4.89">want to go back home they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="542.209" dur="4.291">be in these other countries maybe the</text>
  <text start="544.76" dur="3.689">criminals do maybe the drug people do</text>
  <text start="546.5" dur="4.589">maybe the gun runners do maybe the</text>
  <text start="548.449" dur="5.13">pedophiles do maybe the rapists do but</text>
  <text start="551.089" dur="5.19">the rest of the people they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="553.579" dur="4.95">to be there and if the country was doing</text>
  <text start="556.279" dur="4.8">their job they would be screening these</text>
  <text start="558.529" dur="4.62">individuals to see who are you where do</text>
  <text start="561.079" dur="5.01">you come from have you committed crimes</text>
  <text start="563.149" dur="5.37">in your other country and again they</text>
  <text start="566.089" dur="4.981">don&amp;#39;t want to talk about this so we</text>
  <text start="568.519" dur="4.531">already see the movement is moving</text>
  <text start="571.07" dur="4.32">forward right now and other countries</text>
  <text start="573.05" dur="5.399">are starting to do what&amp;#39;s is what is</text>
  <text start="575.39" dur="5.699">happening here in the US we see this</text>
  <text start="578.449" dur="5.491">whole Ukrainian story of an</text>
  <text start="581.089" dur="4.921">assassination is completely falling</text>
  <text start="583.94" dur="3.15">apart and we need to go back a little</text>
  <text start="586.01" dur="4.24">bit in time here</text>
  <text start="587.09" dur="5.62">we see that Ukraine and that there was a</text>
  <text start="590.25" dur="4.92">reporter there where they were supposed</text>
  <text start="592.71" dur="4.92">to be a hit on this reporter and this</text>
  <text start="595.17" dur="4.92">reporter defected from Russia and was in</text>
  <text start="597.63" dur="5.07">Ukraine and basically they staged the</text>
  <text start="600.09" dur="5.46">whole thing where they said he was dead</text>
  <text start="602.7" dur="4.8">the wife discovered the body it was out</text>
  <text start="605.55" dur="3.66">in the newspapers and then we come to</text>
  <text start="607.5" dur="4.26">find out the reporter is not dead they</text>
  <text start="609.21" dur="5.85">said they did this to trap the Russian</text>
  <text start="611.76" dur="4.98">assassin and this is why they did all of</text>
  <text start="615.06" dur="4.53">this no I think what was happening here</text>
  <text start="616.74" dur="6.03">this was a complete false flag and they</text>
  <text start="619.59" dur="4.8">tried to create this idea that Russia</text>
  <text start="622.77" dur="4.02">was going around assassinating people</text>
  <text start="624.39" dur="5.52">and they can blame this on Russia just</text>
  <text start="626.79" dur="4.89">like hmm oh the UK same thing they did</text>
  <text start="629.91" dur="3.54">there with these scribbles where they</text>
  <text start="631.68" dur="3.84">said Russia tried to assassinate them</text>
  <text start="633.45" dur="5.37">and that completely backfired and what</text>
  <text start="635.52" dur="5.25">happened here is that the assassin the</text>
  <text start="638.82" dur="5.4">hitman that was supposed to be from</text>
  <text start="640.77" dur="6.33">Russia turns out that he was really</text>
  <text start="644.22" dur="5.07">Ukrainian counterintelligence Ukraine</text>
  <text start="647.1" dur="4.77">initially denied it but then said yeah</text>
  <text start="649.29" dur="7.38">he&amp;#39;s part of the counterintelligence and</text>
  <text start="651.87" dur="7.05">the guy who hired the Hitman he is also</text>
  <text start="656.67" dur="5.39">part of Ukrainian counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="658.92" dur="6.27">the whole thing was a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="662.06" dur="6.04">setup to blame Russia and it completely</text>
  <text start="665.19" dur="4.89">backfired and it&amp;#39;s the same thing with</text>

  <text start="705.24" dur="4.29">want to keep the country in limbo and</text>
  <text start="706.98" dur="6.75">the only way to do this is to have the</text>

  <text start="720.7" dur="3.15">that the country doesn&amp;#39;t employ because</text>

  <text start="723.85" dur="3.54">who&amp;#39;s to blame</text>
  <text start="725.05" dur="4.23">well the IMF and they don&amp;#39;t want that to</text>
  <text start="727.39" dur="4.14">happen and this is why the people are so</text>
  <text start="729.28" dur="4.4">angry because in many of these countries</text>
  <text start="731.53" dur="4.5">they can&amp;#39;t take any more of this and</text>
  <text start="733.68" dur="4.33">they&amp;#39;re gonna be looking at the central</text>
  <text start="736.03" dur="4.83">bank saying you&amp;#39;re the ones who keep</text>
  <text start="738.01" dur="4.95">giving us more and more debt we cannot</text>
  <text start="740.86" dur="3.75">sustain our country with all of this</text>
  <text start="742.96" dur="4.17">debt and I think what&amp;#39;s gonna happen</text>
  <text start="744.61" dur="4.62">here as time goes on more and more</text>
  <text start="747.13" dur="4.62">countries are starting to wake up and</text>
  <text start="749.23" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re starting to figure out who is</text>
  <text start="751.75" dur="5.79">continually pushing all of this debt on</text>
  <text start="754.36" dur="6.06">us it&amp;#39;s the central banks and we see</text>
  <text start="757.54" dur="5.37">right now it&amp;#39;s just beginning with Italy</text>
  <text start="760.42" dur="4.68">Jordan we&amp;#39;re gonna see it in Spain the</text>

  <text start="766.99" dur="4.86">and we see that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="769.23" dur="6.58">falling apart in many different areas of</text>
  <text start="771.85" dur="7.4">Europe especially with the u.s. removing</text>
  <text start="775.81" dur="7.92">itself from the Iranian nuclear deal and</text>
  <text start="779.25" dur="7.18">pushing tariffs on Europe we see out in</text>
  <text start="783.73" dur="5.91">Qatar it looks like they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="786.43" dur="6.99">buying the s400 missile system from</text>
  <text start="789.64" dur="6.57">Russia and again we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="793.42" dur="4.41">countries now purchasing the s400</text>
  <text start="796.21" dur="4.05">because I think what is happening here</text>
  <text start="797.83" dur="5.67">is as these countries turn towards</text>
  <text start="800.26" dur="5.52">Russia turns towards China move away</text>
  <text start="803.5" dur="3.96">from the dollar they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="805.78" dur="5.55">protect themselves and they don&amp;#39;t trust</text>
  <text start="807.46" dur="5.85">the US made military assets they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="811.33" dur="5.58">going to trust the Russian or the</text>
  <text start="813.31" dur="5.22">Chinese or anyone over there in the BRIC</text>
  <text start="816.91" dur="3.69">nations they&amp;#39;re gonna trust mostly</text>
  <text start="818.53" dur="4.83">Russian China they&amp;#39;re gonna trust their</text>
  <text start="820.6" dur="4.17">systems compared to the US because if</text>
  <text start="823.36" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re moving towards Russia and China</text>
  <text start="824.77" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re gonna use their systems to</text>
  <text start="826.78" dur="3.03">protect themselves against the deep</text>
  <text start="828.64" dur="3.39">state and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="829.81" dur="5.43">worried about they&amp;#39;re worried about the</text>
  <text start="832.03" dur="6.54">deep state coming after them now we see</text>
  <text start="835.24" dur="5.46">out in Syria a large number of rebels</text>
  <text start="838.57" dur="4.11">they are settling their cases with the</text>
  <text start="840.7" dur="3.9">government they are now returning to</text>
  <text start="842.68" dur="4.59">civilian life they&amp;#39;re handing over their</text>
  <text start="844.6" dur="4.29">weapons they&amp;#39;re gaining back their legal</text>
  <text start="847.27" dur="3.6">status they&amp;#39;re handing over their</text>

  <text start="850.87" dur="4.16">sniper rifles and other</text>
  <text start="852.54" dur="4.53">munitions to the authorities and we see</text>
  <text start="855.03" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s pretty much game over for the</text>
  <text start="857.07" dur="4.29">terrorist groups it&amp;#39;s game over for the</text>
  <text start="858.93" dur="4.56">coalition forces and we see right now</text>
  <text start="861.36" dur="4.62">that Turkey and us it looks like they</text>
  <text start="863.49" dur="4.32">have a roadmap for manbij even though</text>
  <text start="865.98" dur="3.9">the State Department the White House I</text>
  <text start="867.81" dur="3.75">should say continually denies it I think</text>
  <text start="869.88" dur="3.87">things were happening behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="871.56" dur="4.47">and they didn&amp;#39;t want to mention it yet</text>
  <text start="873.75" dur="5.37">but I think they&amp;#39;re coming up with some</text>
  <text start="876.03" dur="4.65">type of deal and I think what is</text>
  <text start="879.12" dur="3.81">happening here is all there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="880.68" dur="4.43">negotiations happening behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="882.93" dur="5.01">we already see that Iranian advisers</text>
  <text start="885.11" dur="6.25">they were called in to damascus to</text>
  <text start="887.94" dur="7.1">discuss their role in syria and i</text>
  <text start="891.36" dur="6.9">believe Putin he pushed this agenda and</text>
  <text start="895.04" dur="5.98">let the word out that all foreign troops</text>
  <text start="898.26" dur="4.65">must leave Syria you know he already</text>
  <text start="901.02" dur="4.05">spoke to Syria he already spoke to Trump</text>
  <text start="902.91" dur="3.69">he already spoke to the Chinese leaders</text>
  <text start="905.07" dur="4.5">this was already planned from the</text>
  <text start="906.6" dur="5.76">beginning and what they do is they let</text>
  <text start="909.57" dur="4.86">out some breadcrumbs to see how</text>
  <text start="912.36" dur="3.33">everyone&amp;#39;s going to react everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="914.43" dur="2.7">gonna get it off their chest that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="915.69" dur="3.09">not leaving we&amp;#39;ll do what we want we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="917.13" dur="5.43">gonna stay there and eventually what</text>
  <text start="918.78" dur="5.88">happens is it breaks down and Syria all</text>
  <text start="922.56" dur="4.74">they have to do is say we want to ran to</text>
  <text start="924.66" dur="4.74">leave if we ask Iran to leave will the</text>
  <text start="927.3" dur="5.55">US and the coalition forces leave and if</text>
  <text start="929.4" dur="5.28">they both agree guess what the deal has</text>
  <text start="932.85" dur="4.26">been made and I think this is where we</text>
  <text start="934.68" dur="4.2">are moving right now and I believe this</text>
  <text start="937.11" dur="4.8">is why the Iranian advisers are there</text>
  <text start="938.88" dur="4.65">even if they say we&amp;#39;re not leaving still</text>
  <text start="941.91" dur="4.11">in the background to save face</text>
  <text start="943.53" dur="4.74">throughout the world they&amp;#39;re gonna say</text>
  <text start="946.02" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;re not gonna leave but if Assad does</text>
  <text start="948.27" dur="5.76">ask us to leave we will leave and I</text>
  <text start="951.42" dur="2.97">think they will because who&amp;#39;s behind all</text>
  <text start="954.03" dur="2.97">this</text>
  <text start="954.39" dur="4.83">Putin and I think he&amp;#39;s pushing his</text>
  <text start="957" dur="7.65">agenda to get the foreign troops out of</text>
  <text start="959.22" dur="9.27">Syria now we see that q is back he was</text>

  <text start="1008.91" dur="6.39">can see the graphic there if you turn it</text>
  <text start="1010.32" dur="7.29">upside down it looks like a gun and we</text>
  <text start="1015.3" dur="4.53">know that Q is the hammer and it looks</text>
  <text start="1017.61" dur="4.86">like that this is going to be a week to</text>
  <text start="1019.83" dur="5.849">remember the gun is to the deep States</text>
  <text start="1022.47" dur="6.599">head and we can see we&amp;#39;re going from</text>
  <text start="1025.679" dur="5.701">dark to light and there was a reason why</text>
  <text start="1029.069" dur="5.031">there was a blackout now there are an</text>
  <text start="1031.38" dur="5.699">ins out there who are speculating of why</text>
  <text start="1034.1" dur="6.94">there was a blackout because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1037.079" dur="7.5">taking over the H hand board this is US</text>
  <text start="1041.04" dur="6.269">military intelligence NSA it looks like</text>
  <text start="1044.579" dur="4.681">they&amp;#39;re gonna be taking control so they</text>
  <text start="1047.309" dur="6.151">can control what is happening on these</text>

  <text start="1063.29" dur="4.84">think they were preparing for all of</text>
  <text start="1066.48" dur="4.079">this news we&amp;#39;ll have to see if this news</text>
  <text start="1068.13" dur="5.58">comes out but we can see that things are</text>
  <text start="1070.559" dur="5.461">rapidly moving forward right now and I</text>
  <text start="1073.71" dur="4.62">believe we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot more go</text>
  <text start="1076.02" dur="5.01">down now we see that North Korea the</text>

  <text start="1092.79" dur="4.1">remember we still have all these</text>
  <text start="1094.71" dur="5.55">indictments and that brings me back to</text>
  <text start="1096.89" dur="4.93">what Trump did back in January with his</text>

  <text start="1225.24" dur="6.21">of them in a year or two is very very</text>
  <text start="1228.54" dur="4.89">difficult to just go ahead and move them</text>
