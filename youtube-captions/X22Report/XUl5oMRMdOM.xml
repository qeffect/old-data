  <text start="57.129" dur="5.551">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.57" dur="7.38">episode 1362 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="62.68" dur="6.21">August 23rd 2017 and the thought of the</text>
  <text start="65.95" dur="6.24">episode is the old economy is giving way</text>
  <text start="68.89" dur="6.03">to a new economic system let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="72.19" dur="5.099">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="74.92" dur="4.53">we know that the NAFTA negotiations</text>
  <text start="77.289" dur="6.301">while that is continuing it&amp;#39;s ongoing</text>
  <text start="79.45" dur="6.059">and Trump is out there and he&amp;#39;s warning</text>
  <text start="83.59" dur="3.389">that he might scrap the entire North</text>
  <text start="85.509" dur="4.381">American Free Trade Agreement which is</text>
  <text start="86.979" dur="4.861">NAFTA with Mexico and Canada saying that</text>
  <text start="89.89" dur="5.429">you know if the sides can&amp;#39;t compromise</text>
  <text start="91.84" dur="4.529">on this twenty-three-year-old deal then</text>
  <text start="95.319" dur="2.401">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to get rid of it he</text>
  <text start="96.369" dur="3.271">finally came out and said listen</text>
  <text start="97.72" dur="3.66">personally I don&amp;#39;t think we can make a</text>
  <text start="99.64" dur="4.769">deal I think we&amp;#39;ll probably end up</text>
  <text start="101.38" dur="4.98">terminating NAFTA at some point and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="104.409" dur="5.091">saying that you know this might not even</text>
  <text start="106.36" dur="5.25">work out now when he was running for the</text>
  <text start="109.5" dur="4.149">presidency he said NAFTA was a</text>
  <text start="111.61" dur="4.38">completely bad deal now he is a</text>
  <text start="113.649" dur="3.991">businessman he knows what deals how</text>
  <text start="115.99" dur="4.979">deals are made he knows if they&amp;#39;re good</text>
  <text start="117.64" dur="6.06">or bad and I think he needs to go back</text>
  <text start="120.969" dur="4.771">to his roots and I think he needs to</text>
  <text start="123.7" dur="4.29">take a really deep look and I know</text>
  <text start="125.74" dur="4.559">there&amp;#39;s a lot of pressure from outside</text>
  <text start="127.99" dur="4.529">groups who want to keep NAFTA there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="130.299" dur="4.41">lot of pressure from the Cabal there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="132.519" dur="4.47">lot of pressure from everywhere but he</text>
  <text start="134.709" dur="4.53">needs to go back to his roots of what</text>
  <text start="136.989" dur="4.5">he&amp;#39;s been saying during the campaign to</text>
  <text start="139.239" dur="5.071">become president and he needs to say you</text>
  <text start="141.489" dur="6.271">know something I am the president right</text>
  <text start="144.31" dur="5.429">now I looked at the deal and it is awful</text>
  <text start="147.76" dur="5.22">it did not help America I mean he gave</text>
  <text start="149.739" dur="5.671">statistics showing how he lost 800,000</text>
  <text start="152.98" dur="5.58">jobs I think at this point we need to</text>
  <text start="155.41" dur="7.26">scrap it and come up with something</text>
  <text start="158.56" dur="6.81">completely different and will he do this</text>
  <text start="162.67" dur="4.92">well only time will tell we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="165.37" dur="5.73">right now we see the negotiations going</text>
  <text start="167.59" dur="4.86">on but what we do know is if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="171.1" dur="3.96">come up with any type of deal and he</text>
  <text start="172.45" dur="4.289">doesn&amp;#39;t scrap this this won&amp;#39;t help the</text>
  <text start="175.06" dur="3.75">economy whatsoever because we see the</text>
  <text start="176.739" dur="5.071">economy it is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="178.81" dur="6.06">and we&amp;#39;re seeing every single sector</text>
  <text start="181.81" dur="4.83">well it&amp;#39;s imploding new home sales</text>

  <text start="189.88" dur="4.14">month-on-month</text>
  <text start="191.14" dur="4.44">now they thought and I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="194.02" dur="3.6">the financial pundits the government</text>
  <text start="195.58" dur="4.77">they thought that this was going to be a</text>
  <text start="197.62" dur="5.04">pretty darn good month and a</text>
  <text start="200.35" dur="4.8">year-over-year it was an eight point</text>
  <text start="202.66" dur="6.42">nine percent plunge this is the worst</text>
  <text start="205.15" dur="8.28">since 2014 and where are we today well</text>
  <text start="209.08" dur="7.11">we are nowhere the housing market has</text>
  <text start="213.43" dur="5.73">been bouncing up and down around the</text>
  <text start="216.19" dur="7.35">zero percent mark we average it all out</text>
  <text start="219.16" dur="5.97">it is gone absolutely nowhere it is dead</text>
  <text start="223.54" dur="3.57">now think about it we have higher</text>
  <text start="225.13" dur="4.38">mortgage rates we have stagnant wages</text>
  <text start="227.11" dur="4.92">people are losing their jobs and the</text>
  <text start="229.51" dur="5.4">housing prices in these 20 cities are</text>
  <text start="232.03" dur="4.44">continually moving up and up and up so</text>
  <text start="234.91" dur="4.22">how are people going to purchase houses</text>
  <text start="236.47" dur="6.45">well it&amp;#39;s not the American people its</text>
  <text start="239.13" dur="6.51">Chinese investors hedge funds investment</text>
  <text start="242.92" dur="6.42">companies we also need to remember that</text>
  <text start="245.64" dur="7.75">household formation it has collapsed in</text>
  <text start="249.34" dur="10.639">June now the last time we saw this was</text>
  <text start="253.39" dur="11.279">back in 2007 we are now below that point</text>
  <text start="259.979" dur="7.901">which tells us we are bordering on this</text>
  <text start="264.669" dur="5.701">collapse now we are definitely in a</text>
  <text start="267.88" dur="6.06">recession I know the corporate media I</text>
  <text start="270.37" dur="5.39">know the government the Fed they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="273.94" dur="4.62">out there telling us that we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="275.76" dur="3.94">recession but we are they&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="278.56" dur="4.65">back in time and say listen the</text>
  <text start="279.7" dur="5.73">recession started in 2016 2017 or the</text>
  <text start="283.21" dur="5.85">beginning of 2018 they might even say</text>
  <text start="285.43" dur="5.52">listen we entered a depression but for</text>
  <text start="289.06" dur="3.81">right now they&amp;#39;re continually pushing</text>
  <text start="290.95" dur="4.86">the market up making everyone believe</text>
  <text start="292.87" dur="5.88">that everything is fine now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="295.81" dur="5.91">interesting institutional risk analyst</text>
  <text start="298.75" dur="5.43">Chris Whelan well he&amp;#39;s looking at the</text>
  <text start="301.72" dur="4.68">situation and for those people that have</text>
  <text start="304.18" dur="5.28">seen game of Thrones you know winter is</text>
  <text start="306.4" dur="6.93">coming while he&amp;#39;s saying winter is here</text>
  <text start="309.46" dur="7.11">for housing and what he&amp;#39;s saying is that</text>
  <text start="313.33" dur="4.86">we are in trouble the big picture on</text>
  <text start="316.57" dur="3.78">housing reflected in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="318.19" dur="5.85">media is one of</text>
  <text start="320.35" dur="6.93">caution home valuations are one of the</text>
  <text start="324.04" dur="3.99">clearest indicators of inflation in the</text>
  <text start="327.28" dur="4.62">US economy</text>
  <text start="328.03" dur="6.24">in fact since World War two home prices</text>
  <text start="331.9" dur="5.85">in the US have gone up four times the</text>
  <text start="334.27" dur="6.84">official inflation rate now houses</text>
  <text start="337.75" dur="7.61">weren&amp;#39;t always this expensive go back to</text>
  <text start="341.11" dur="5.4">1940 the median home value in the US was</text>
  <text start="345.36" dur="8.2">2938</text>
  <text start="346.51" dur="10.89">in 1980 it was 47,000 by 2000 it was a</text>
  <text start="353.56" dur="7.89">hundred and nineteen thousand and here</text>
  <text start="357.4" dur="6.96">we are today in 2018 and it&amp;#39;s even above</text>
  <text start="361.45" dur="5.12">the hundred and nineteen thousand so</text>
  <text start="364.36" dur="5.7">what we are seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="366.57" dur="6.07">inflation actually it&amp;#39;s the devaluation</text>
  <text start="370.06" dur="7.38">of the dollar it takes that many more</text>
  <text start="372.64" dur="6.78">dollars to buy the same home now there</text>
  <text start="377.44" dur="4.68">are two indicators that are specially</text>
  <text start="379.42" dur="5.4">worrying in the world of credit so if we</text>
  <text start="382.12" dur="5.01">look at the NBA data if you subtract the</text>
  <text start="384.82" dur="5.16">effects of mortgage service rights from</text>
  <text start="387.13" dur="7.35">pre-tax income most of the industry is</text>
  <text start="389.98" dur="6.45">operating at a significant loss and when</text>
  <text start="394.48" dur="5.07">you look at non-performing loans you can</text>
  <text start="396.43" dur="6.24">see well the service cost per loan is</text>
  <text start="399.55" dur="4.68">continually moving up and if you go back</text>
  <text start="402.67" dur="5.45">in time you can see it was much much</text>
  <text start="404.23" dur="6.86">lower back in time now we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="408.12" dur="7.57">manufacturing well Manufacturing has</text>
  <text start="411.09" dur="6.34">completely imploded on itself now I know</text>
  <text start="415.69" dur="3.6">Trump has been saying he wants to bring</text>
  <text start="417.43" dur="3.27">manufacturing back he wants to bring</text>
  <text start="419.29" dur="3.15">jobs back he&amp;#39;s telling everyone he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="420.7" dur="5.85">created all these jobs these are</text>
  <text start="422.44" dur="7.02">part-time low-paying jobs it&amp;#39;s all being</text>
  <text start="426.55" dur="5.1">manipulated in government that has not</text>
  <text start="429.46" dur="4.86">changed since Obama has been there</text>
  <text start="431.65" dur="5.55">everything is status quo and what he</text>
  <text start="434.32" dur="4.8">wanted to do with manufacturing he</text>
  <text start="437.2" dur="4.53">wanted to make deals with all these</text>
  <text start="439.12" dur="5.19">corporations bring them back to the</text>
  <text start="441.73" dur="5.28">United States and prepare the economy</text>
  <text start="444.31" dur="4.14">for this transition for this economic</text>
  <text start="447.01" dur="3.39">collapse because we know the economy</text>
  <text start="448.45" dur="5.58">cannot be sustained right now and he</text>
  <text start="450.4" dur="5.67">wanted to prepare the economy for the</text>
  <text start="454.03" dur="3.96">new system and the only way we can</text>
  <text start="456.07" dur="3.69">survive is to have some type of</text>
  <text start="457.99" dur="5.31">manufacturing we need to produce</text>
  <text start="459.76" dur="5.37">something here in the United States now</text>
  <text start="463.3" dur="5.16">there&amp;#39;s an interesting article that came</text>
  <text start="465.13" dur="7.35">out of Newsmax and the title reads the</text>
  <text start="468.46" dur="6.75">US will plunge into recession within 12</text>
  <text start="472.48" dur="4.38">to 18 months which is very interesting</text>
  <text start="475.21" dur="3.63">and they&amp;#39;re looking at the economy right</text>
  <text start="476.86" dur="3.81">now and we can see already with the</text>
  <text start="478.84" dur="5.1">corporate media they are going to be</text>
  <text start="480.67" dur="5.19">building this narrative that the economy</text>
  <text start="483.94" dur="4.89">is coming down and most likely they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="485.86" dur="6.18">blame it on Trump of course what they</text>
  <text start="488.83" dur="5.64">are saying here is that stock valuations</text>
  <text start="492.04" dur="4.98">are the discounted values of future</text>
  <text start="494.47" dur="4.59">earnings now future earnings depend on</text>
  <text start="497.02" dur="4.68">future revenue which may diminish</text>
  <text start="499.06" dur="5.46">whenever the future includes a recession</text>
  <text start="501.7" dur="5.73">so broad economic conditions are a big</text>
  <text start="504.52" dur="5.28">factor to watch in stock valuation broad</text>
  <text start="507.43" dur="4.95">economic conditions depend on the</text>
  <text start="509.8" dur="6.15">consumers ability and willingness to</text>
  <text start="512.38" dur="6.75">spend money and July retail sales report</text>
  <text start="515.95" dur="6.06">well they gave us a peek into that and</text>
  <text start="519.13" dur="6.39">what we see right now is that consumer</text>
  <text start="522.01" dur="7.02">spending is far lower than it should be</text>
  <text start="525.52" dur="5.46">at this point in the cycle and we can</text>
  <text start="529.03" dur="3.42">see right now they&amp;#39;re looking at this</text>
  <text start="530.98" dur="4.02">and some of them are starting to say</text>
  <text start="532.45" dur="5.07">okay we have problems showing up in the</text>
  <text start="535" dur="4.62">economy it&amp;#39;s not because of online sales</text>
  <text start="537.52" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s not because of bad weather it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="539.62" dur="5.79">because the everyday person is not</text>
  <text start="542.05" dur="5.55">spending the funds now they look at the</text>
  <text start="545.41" dur="4.86">real value added now we looked at this</text>
  <text start="547.6" dur="4.74">before and when this goes into the</text>
  <text start="550.27" dur="5.82">negative territory and this is a very</text>
  <text start="552.34" dur="6.21">good indicator of predicting a recession</text>
  <text start="556.09" dur="4.65">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="558.55" dur="6.3">and if we look back in time if we look</text>
  <text start="560.74" dur="9.53">back to 1990 the real value indicator</text>
  <text start="564.85" dur="9.21">well that went into negative territory</text>
  <text start="570.27" dur="7.63">maybe a couple of months before we moved</text>
  <text start="574.06" dur="6.21">into a recession in the 90s the same</text>
  <text start="577.9" dur="4.41">thing happened in 2000 he actually if we</text>
  <text start="580.27" dur="4.38">go back in time all the way to 1948 it</text>
  <text start="582.31" dur="4.05">predicted a recession almost every</text>
  <text start="584.65" dur="3.67">single time almost has a perfect record</text>
  <text start="586.36" dur="5.68">and here we are</text>
  <text start="588.32" dur="8.52">today in 2017 and if we look at the real</text>
  <text start="592.04" dur="9.78">value added well guess what we are below</text>
  <text start="596.84" dur="10.7">zero we&amp;#39;re at negative two percent right</text>
  <text start="601.82" dur="10.55">now which means we are in a recession</text>
  <text start="607.54" dur="7.15">the recession is already here and</text>
  <text start="612.37" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re making the case and this is why</text>
  <text start="614.69" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re saying a recession is coming</text>
  <text start="616.33" dur="3.4">actually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="618.2" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re gonna go back in time and</text>
  <text start="619.73" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re gonna look at all the indicators</text>
  <text start="621.62" dur="4.38">look at everything and say well the</text>
  <text start="623.39" dur="3.81">recession really started in 2016 and of</text>
  <text start="626" dur="3.36">course they&amp;#39;re gonna point the rich to</text>
  <text start="627.2" dur="3.72">the real real value added and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="629.36" dur="4.47">gonna say yes this is when it occurred</text>
  <text start="630.92" dur="5.04">we are in a recession right now yes</text>
  <text start="633.83" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;re keeping the illusion alive yes</text>
  <text start="635.96" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re trying to make everyone believe</text>
  <text start="637.13" dur="5.43">that we&amp;#39;re not but what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="639.62" dur="5.28">happen is that all this data is gonna</text>
  <text start="642.56" dur="7.14">start to pour out and the corporate</text>
  <text start="644.9" dur="6.84">media the Fed the Cabal they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="649.7" dur="4.02">point the finger and they&amp;#39;re gonna say</text>
  <text start="651.74" dur="3.81">well it&amp;#39;s because of what Trump is been</text>
  <text start="653.72" dur="3.81">doing now remember in the beginning of</text>
  <text start="655.55" dur="6.39">this year they couldn&amp;#39;t blame it on him</text>
  <text start="657.53" dur="7.14">it was too early now that were further</text>
  <text start="661.94" dur="5.04">into this year going into August I mean</text>
  <text start="664.67" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;re in August going into September now</text>
  <text start="666.98" dur="4.2">they can start building the narrative</text>
  <text start="669.26" dur="4.05">and this is what they&amp;#39;ve started to do</text>
  <text start="671.18" dur="5.49">and we can see they&amp;#39;re gonna turn up the</text>
  <text start="673.31" dur="5.52">heat very very soon now what is</text>
  <text start="676.67" dur="4.38">happening here in this economy this old</text>

  <text start="770.75" dur="5.07">Canada and eventually the United States</text>
  <text start="773.23" dur="4.359">because if you know if the United States</text>
  <text start="775.82" dur="4.86">is not involved in this in this new</text>
  <text start="777.589" dur="5.221">economic system guess what we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="780.68" dur="6.57">gonna be able to survive but again it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="782.81" dur="7.56">still a central banking system we have</text>
  <text start="787.25" dur="5.88">an escape that yet and hopefully with</text>
  <text start="790.37" dur="4.89">cryptocurrency we will have the</text>
  <text start="793.13" dur="3.54">opportunity to do this because the</text>
  <text start="795.26" dur="3.449">people around the world may been</text>
  <text start="796.67" dur="4.74">protesting quite a bit against the</text>
  <text start="798.709" dur="4.38">central banks hopefully everyone comes</text>
  <text start="801.41" dur="4.83">out and says listen we don&amp;#39;t need a</text>
  <text start="803.089" dur="5.821">central bank there&amp;#39;s no reason for it we</text>
  <text start="806.24" dur="5.73">can create currency on our own we can</text>
  <text start="808.91" dur="4.65">make deals we can take out loans we can</text>
  <text start="811.97" dur="4.89">do everything without the central bank</text>
  <text start="813.56" dur="6.69">actually without the banking system but</text>
  <text start="816.86" dur="5.52">again the central banks they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="820.25" dur="5.16">this to happen they&amp;#39;re gonna do whatever</text>
  <text start="822.38" dur="5.49">they possibly can to keep their system</text>
  <text start="825.41" dur="3.869">alive and of course they&amp;#39;ll call their</text>
  <text start="827.87" dur="3.659">system something completely different it</text>
  <text start="829.279" dur="4.081">won&amp;#39;t be the dollar anymore and when it</text>
  <text start="831.529" dur="4.17">first starts out it will be backed by</text>
  <text start="833.36" dur="5.4">gold this is what they&amp;#39;re setting up</text>
  <text start="835.699" dur="5.88">right now it&amp;#39;s not like they set this up</text>
  <text start="838.76" dur="7.37">yesterday if you go back to my beginning</text>
  <text start="841.579" dur="8.49">reports this has been an ongoing plan</text>
  <text start="846.13" dur="6.22">since the beginning and you can see when</text>
  <text start="850.069" dur="4.26">China was introduced the yuyuan</text>
  <text start="852.35" dur="2.87">introduced into the SDR</text>
  <text start="854.329" dur="3.11">you can</text>
  <text start="855.22" dur="5.039">they set up all the payment system the</text>
  <text start="857.439" dur="4.411">gold exchange system they&amp;#39;re dealing</text>
  <text start="860.259" dur="3.781">without the dollar I mean think about</text>
  <text start="861.85" dur="4.349">how much has happened since we</text>
  <text start="864.04" dur="6.299">originally started talking about this</text>
  <text start="866.199" dur="6.69">and they&amp;#39;re almost ready to leave the</text>
  <text start="870.339" dur="5.37">dollar they really don&amp;#39;t need it there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="872.889" dur="5.82">no reason to be using it anymore and</text>
  <text start="875.709" dur="5.67">they know this and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="878.709" dur="3.151">basically dotting the eyes crossing the</text>
  <text start="881.379" dur="3.27">t&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="881.86" dur="6.75">getting prepared and ready to switch</text>
  <text start="884.649" dur="6.331">everything to the new system but there</text>
  <text start="888.61" dur="4.349">are certain individuals within the US</text>
  <text start="890.98" dur="4.74">government who make a lot of money</text>
  <text start="892.959" dur="5.101">government officials who don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="895.72" dur="6.75">system to go because they receive free</text>
  <text start="898.06" dur="7.41">money they become very very wealthy they</text>
  <text start="902.47" dur="5.58">can control the world with the dollar</text>
  <text start="905.47" dur="5.369">it&amp;#39;s a war currency they can control</text>
  <text start="908.05" dur="6.18">everywhere with sanctions if this</text>
  <text start="910.839" dur="5.971">disappears their influence their control</text>
  <text start="914.23" dur="6.029">disappears and this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="916.81" dur="5.999">trying to keep the system the way it is</text>
  <text start="920.259" dur="4.861">they don&amp;#39;t want it to end there are</text>
  <text start="922.809" dur="3.9">certain others who are saying listen we</text>
  <text start="925.12" dur="2.339">got to get rid of this this is no good</text>
  <text start="926.709" dur="3.661">for the country</text>
  <text start="927.459" dur="4.711">I don&amp;#39;t think China system is going to</text>
  <text start="930.37" dur="3.149">be any better for the world I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="932.17" dur="3.839">gonna be controlled by the central banks</text>
  <text start="933.519" dur="5.67">I think the people around the world are</text>
  <text start="936.009" dur="6.51">going to need to take control of a new</text>
  <text start="939.189" dur="5.041">system and this new system will need to</text>
  <text start="942.519" dur="4.8">work for the people it will need to be</text>
  <text start="944.23" dur="8.49">controlled by the people and we need it</text>
  <text start="947.319" dur="9.091">so no other entity can control the</text>
  <text start="952.72" dur="6.63">currency of the world because we know</text>
  <text start="956.41" dur="5.669">the same from the central bank from the</text>
  <text start="959.35" dur="5.849">Rothschilds they don&amp;#39;t care who makes</text>
  <text start="962.079" dur="6.12">the laws as long as they can control the</text>
  <text start="965.199" dur="5.07">currency that is the control you can put</text>
  <text start="968.199" dur="4.89">countries into debt you can buy their</text>
  <text start="970.269" dur="6">assets for pennies on the dollar you can</text>
  <text start="973.089" dur="6.631">control the world if you can control the</text>
  <text start="976.269" dur="7.591">creation of currency this is what we</text>
  <text start="979.72" dur="6.39">need to stop so the system is coming</text>
  <text start="983.86" dur="4.919">down a new system is going to be born</text>
  <text start="986.11" dur="2.91">the dollar is going to be devalued quite</text>

  <text start="992.8" dur="4.35">wealth this is why you need</text>
  <text start="994.33" dur="4.65">cryptocurrency because I&amp;#39;m sure the new</text>
  <text start="997.15" dur="6">system is going to be some type of</text>
  <text start="998.98" dur="5.73">cryptocurrency with exchanges don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1003.15" dur="3.54">who&amp;#39;s gonna control that as of yet</text>
  <text start="1004.71" dur="5.97">hopefully the people will take control</text>
  <text start="1006.69" dur="5.94">of it and you can see right now as we go</text>
  <text start="1010.68" dur="4.86">through this entire transition</text>
  <text start="1012.63" dur="5.22">you&amp;#39;re gonna need food water supplies</text>
  <text start="1015.54" dur="3.99">because the value of the dollar is going</text>
  <text start="1017.85" dur="3.72">to decrease we&amp;#39;re gonna see inflation</text>
