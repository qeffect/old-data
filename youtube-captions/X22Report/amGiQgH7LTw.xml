  <text start="134.29" dur="9.3">well the deal is off right now because</text>
  <text start="139.829" dur="8.371">the administration didn&amp;#39;t live up to the</text>
  <text start="143.59" dur="8.459">agreement and what Assange really wanted</text>
  <text start="148.2" dur="7.03">he wanted Chelsea Manning to be released</text>
  <text start="152.049" dur="7.231">immediately instead Chelsea Manning will</text>
  <text start="155.23" dur="8.49">be released in May well short of what he</text>

  <text start="172.47" dur="6.19">Assange is still happy to come to the US</text>
  <text start="175.48" dur="6.42">on the condition that all his rights are</text>

  <text start="185.92" dur="6.09">away and the statement from Julian</text>
  <text start="189.43" dur="4.919">Assange says I welcome President Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="192.01" dur="4.559">decision to commute the sentence of miss</text>
  <text start="194.349" dur="4.321">Chelsea Manning from 35 years to time</text>
  <text start="196.569" dur="3.991">served but Miss Manning should never</text>
  <text start="198.67" dur="4.83">have been convicted in the first place</text>
  <text start="200.56" dur="5.06">miss Manning is a hero whose bravery</text>
  <text start="203.5" dur="4.95">should have been applauded not condemned</text>
  <text start="205.62" dur="4.66">journalists publishers and their sources</text>
  <text start="208.45" dur="4.47">served the public interest and promote</text>
  <text start="210.28" dur="5.069">democracy by distributing authentic</text>
  <text start="212.92" dur="4.86">information on key matters such as human</text>
  <text start="215.349" dur="4.441">right abuses illegal acts by the</text>
  <text start="217.78" dur="5.01">government officials they should not be</text>
  <text start="219.79" dur="4.68">prosecuted in order for democracy and</text>
  <text start="222.79" dur="3.72">the rule of lord to thrive the</text>
  <text start="224.47" dur="3.87">government should immediately end its</text>
  <text start="226.51" dur="6.33">war on whistleblowers and publishers</text>
  <text start="228.34" dur="8.069">such as WikiLeaks and myself and we can</text>
  <text start="232.84" dur="6.269">see right now Assange most likely will</text>
  <text start="236.409" dur="6.061">not be visiting the u.s. probably any</text>
  <text start="239.109" dur="6.66">time in the near future at this point we</text>
  <text start="242.47" dur="8.01">see that Obama he has given the UN a</text>
  <text start="245.769" dur="6.961">gift of 500 million dollars and where</text>
  <text start="250.48" dur="5.49">does this money go we really don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="252.73" dur="5.789">it&amp;#39;s for global warming but it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="255.97" dur="6.379">interesting in the timing that Obama</text>
  <text start="258.519" dur="7.351">decided to give this money to the UN</text>
  <text start="262.349" dur="6.731">because Trump is out barony says that</text>
  <text start="265.87" dur="7.46">global warming is a hoax and we can see</text>
  <text start="269.08" dur="9">that Obama decided to give the money</text>
  <text start="273.33" dur="7.45">right before his term is up and to date</text>
  <text start="278.08" dur="7.68">he has given the UN 1 billion dollars</text>
  <text start="280.78" dur="7.23">and we can see from John Kirby the State</text>
  <text start="285.76" dur="4.92">Department spokesman said there was no</text>
  <text start="288.01" dur="5.7">nefarious desire or intent behind the</text>
  <text start="290.68" dur="5.22">timing it&amp;#39;s not being done to try to</text>
  <text start="293.71" dur="4.38">provoke a reaction from the incoming</text>
  <text start="295.9" dur="4.769">administration or to try to dictate to</text>
  <text start="298.09" dur="5.18">them one way or the other how they are</text>
  <text start="300.669" dur="6.481">going to deal with the climate issues</text>
  <text start="303.27" dur="7.179">well it&amp;#39;s just very odd that the timing</text>
  <text start="307.15" dur="7.139">was a days before the new administration</text>
  <text start="310.449" dur="6.161">comes in because most likely Trump would</text>
  <text start="314.289" dur="6.581">have stopped though</text>
  <text start="316.61" dur="7.5">funds from going to the UN now the</text>
  <text start="320.87" dur="5.819">Ukrainian Parliament they have now</text>
  <text start="324.11" dur="4.619">adopted a law allowing the emission of</text>
  <text start="326.689" dur="4.861">foreign troops to conduct exercises on</text>
  <text start="328.729" dur="7.141">Ukrainian territory in the year of 2017</text>
  <text start="331.55" dur="7.44">so the drills in their country are going</text>
  <text start="335.87" dur="5.849">to be the sea breeze 2017 rapid traded</text>
  <text start="338.99" dur="6.03">2017 exercises and there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="341.719" dur="6.931">foreign troops inside of Ukraine taking</text>
  <text start="345.02" dur="6.6">part of all these drills and we can see</text>
  <text start="348.65" dur="4.769">why this has been done think about what</text>
  <text start="351.62" dur="3.99">the US and NATO have been doing they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="353.419" dur="5.731">been moving assets they&amp;#39;ve been moving</text>
  <text start="355.61" dur="6.089">troops to all the different areas the</text>
  <text start="359.15" dur="5.759">Baltic States they&amp;#39;ve been moving them</text>
  <text start="361.699" dur="4.981">to the borders of Russia Ukraine they</text>
  <text start="364.909" dur="3.54">want included in this and the only way</text>
  <text start="366.68" dur="4.139">to do this is to vote in foreign troops</text>
  <text start="368.449" dur="6.72">and now they can bring in the foreign</text>
  <text start="370.819" dur="8.31">troops and have these drills because I</text>
  <text start="375.169" dur="6.541">still believe that these elite they are</text>
  <text start="379.129" dur="7.32">ramping everything up positioning</text>
  <text start="381.71" dur="7.319">everything for a major war now the UN</text>
  <text start="386.449" dur="5.75">confirms that Iran&amp;#39;s compliance with the</text>
  <text start="389.029" dur="5.85">nuclear deal well they have met</text>
  <text start="392.199" dur="7.451">everything they needed to meet and they</text>
  <text start="394.879" dur="6.72">are in complete compliance and of course</text>
  <text start="399.65" dur="4.199">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="401.599" dur="4.59">bankers those who don&amp;#39;t like the deal</text>
  <text start="403.849" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re looking at it and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="406.189" dur="4.111">continually using propaganda to say that</text>
  <text start="408.349" dur="3.961">they&amp;#39;re not living up to their end of</text>
  <text start="410.3" dur="4.41">the bargain now we have to understand</text>
  <text start="412.31" dur="5.819">and look at the situation of why this</text>
  <text start="414.71" dur="7.29">deal was made and if you really look at</text>
  <text start="418.129" dur="6.241">it from an outside view point most of</text>
  <text start="422" dur="4.8">the countries that the u.s. goes in and</text>
  <text start="424.37" dur="6.99">has regime change they don&amp;#39;t want these</text>
  <text start="426.8" dur="6.51">countries having nuclear weapons and I</text>
  <text start="431.36" dur="4.859">think what they were worried about was</text>
  <text start="433.31" dur="7.65">Iran actually developing a nuclear</text>
  <text start="436.219" dur="7.26">weapon and this allowed them to keep an</text>
  <text start="440.96" dur="4.29">eye on Iran and to make sure that they</text>
  <text start="443.479" dur="5.151">didn&amp;#39;t develop a nuclear weapon because</text>
  <text start="445.25" dur="5.31">remember their plan was to go into Syria</text>
  <text start="448.63" dur="4.66">replace a son</text>
  <text start="450.56" dur="4.71">and then eventually go into Iran now if</text>
  <text start="453.29" dur="3.93">they had a nuclear weapon I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="455.27" dur="6.06">believe they were going to invade but</text>
  <text start="457.22" dur="7.199">this deal was to stop them now was this</text>
  <text start="461.33" dur="5.13">the only part of their agenda know the</text>
  <text start="464.419" dur="5.641">other part was to hopefully get their</text>
  <text start="466.46" dur="5.76">oil on the petro dollar and Iran didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="470.06" dur="5.19">stick to that deal they decided to use</text>
  <text start="472.22" dur="7.32">the euro instead and in the future move</text>
  <text start="475.25" dur="6.18">towards the you one or the ruble but</text>
  <text start="479.54" dur="3.26">they didn&amp;#39;t care about that right off</text>
  <text start="481.43" dur="3.36">the bat because they knew eventually</text>
  <text start="482.8" dur="3.64">they were going to try to get into a</text>
  <text start="484.79" dur="6.33">rant but all these plans are starting to</text>
  <text start="486.44" dur="9.33">fall apart we see us b-2 bombers they</text>
  <text start="491.12" dur="8.46">went into Libya and they hit targets</text>
  <text start="495.77" dur="6.18">inside of Libya and they killed many</text>
  <text start="499.58" dur="5.79">individuals and they said they were</text>
  <text start="501.95" dur="5.55">going after the Islamic state now this</text>
  <text start="505.37" dur="4.88">is very interesting because when we</text>
  <text start="507.5" dur="8.46">think back of when the u.s. invaded</text>
  <text start="510.25" dur="8.14">Libya Lebanon Yemen Sudan Iraq they</text>
  <text start="515.96" dur="4.05">called those individuals who were</text>
  <text start="518.39" dur="3.75">opposed to the new puppet government</text>
  <text start="520.01" dur="5.3">al-qaeda and they would go in they would</text>
  <text start="522.14" dur="5.61">bomb those individuals with drones today</text>
  <text start="525.31" dur="7.44">they call them the Islamic state all</text>
  <text start="527.75" dur="8.52">those opposing the new UN back</text>
  <text start="532.75" dur="5.86">government they are called the Islamic</text>
  <text start="536.27" dur="4.11">state and this is who they are really</text>
  <text start="538.61" dur="4.77">bombing if you notice the bombing takes</text>
  <text start="540.38" dur="8.58">place takes place on the shoreline where</text>
  <text start="543.38" dur="8.52">they have all the oil pumping areas the</text>
  <text start="548.96" dur="5.3">ports they want that whole area cleared</text>
  <text start="551.9" dur="6.03">that&amp;#39;s what they really care about and</text>
  <text start="554.26" dur="7.24">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="557.93" dur="7.43">Russian I mean the Libyan general he is</text>
  <text start="561.5" dur="7.86">in negotiations right now Khalifa Haftar</text>
  <text start="565.36" dur="6.91">with Russia and they&amp;#39;re negotiating</text>
  <text start="569.36" dur="6.06">billions worth of arms and energy deals</text>
  <text start="572.27" dur="5.64">with Russia and remember there is a</text>
  <text start="575.42" dur="4.37">battle going on right now between the UN</text>
  <text start="577.91" dur="5.89">back government and the opposition</text>
  <text start="579.79" dur="5.81">governments and is more than one</text>
  <text start="583.8" dur="5.25">and these are the governments of the</text>
  <text start="585.6" dur="6.32">people and again there is a battle going</text>
  <text start="589.05" dur="7.219">on right now and what the US is doing is</text>
  <text start="591.92" dur="6.43">they&amp;#39;re trying to push back those</text>
  <text start="596.269" dur="4.451">opposition groups keep them away from</text>
  <text start="598.35" dur="4.32">the ports keep them away from the oil</text>
  <text start="600.72" dur="3.869">keep them away from the oil fields</text>
  <text start="602.67" dur="5.669">that&amp;#39;s why the battles always revolve</text>
  <text start="604.589" dur="7.591">around that area and they&amp;#39;re really not</text>
  <text start="608.339" dur="5.821">hitting the Islamic state yes the</text>
  <text start="612.18" dur="3.75">propaganda on the news that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="614.16" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;re telling you just like they told</text>
  <text start="615.93" dur="2.88">you they were hitting al Qaeda and all</text>
  <text start="617.31" dur="3.63">the other countries no they were hitting</text>
  <text start="618.81" dur="4.62">all those under individuals that didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="620.94" dur="4.019">want the pup government in power that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="623.43" dur="3.149">why you always hurt civilians getting</text>
  <text start="624.959" dur="3.75">hit because it was always civilians</text>
  <text start="626.579" dur="4.981">getting hit because they are the</text>
  <text start="628.709" dur="5.841">opposition now US officials have</text>
  <text start="631.56" dur="7.469">revealed that they have put together a</text>
  <text start="634.55" dur="8.32">sizable Arab force to start this major</text>
  <text start="639.029" dur="7.651">offensive in raka they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="642.87" dur="8.01">they have now counted as many 20 as many</text>
  <text start="646.68" dur="6.599">as 23 thousand men in northern Syria who</text>
  <text start="650.88" dur="3.48">identified themselves as Arab and the</text>
  <text start="653.279" dur="2.881">reason why they&amp;#39;re saying this at this</text>
  <text start="654.36" dur="4.44">point is because there were problems</text>
  <text start="656.16" dur="6.36">before because most of the paid</text>
  <text start="658.8" dur="5.099">mercenaries well they weren&amp;#39;t Syrian if</text>
  <text start="662.52" dur="3.39">you notice they&amp;#39;re using the word Arab</text>
  <text start="663.899" dur="4.411">not Syrian and they&amp;#39;re trying to get</text>
  <text start="665.91" dur="4.23">away get around this right now but it</text>
  <text start="668.31" dur="4.62">looks like what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="670.14" dur="5.25">getting ready to move and have a major</text>
  <text start="672.93" dur="5.57">offensive in Rocca and the offensive is</text>
  <text start="675.39" dur="5.67">going to start very soon because the</text>
  <text start="678.5" dur="5.23">cooperation between Turkey and the US</text>
  <text start="681.06" dur="4.8">that&amp;#39;s the tier rating the other reason</text>
  <text start="683.73" dur="4.049">why they&amp;#39;re pushing this so hard and</text>
  <text start="685.86" dur="4.95">trying to get this done is because the</text>
  <text start="687.779" dur="4.8">peace talks in Astana well they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="690.81" dur="4.31">to be happening and they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="692.579" dur="6">talking about peace and at the same time</text>
  <text start="695.12" dur="6.279">we see the Islamic state is mounting a</text>
  <text start="698.579" dur="4.95">major offensive in Dara&amp;#39;s or we see that</text>
  <text start="701.399" dur="5.701">the u.s. is mounting a major offensive</text>
  <text start="703.529" dur="6.091">in raka at the same time there&amp;#39;s peace</text>
  <text start="707.1" dur="5.97">negotiations going on and all of this</text>
  <text start="709.62" dur="6.12">most likely is to disrupt the peace</text>
  <text start="713.07" dur="4.019">negotiations they don&amp;#39;t want the peace</text>
  <text start="715.74" dur="3.599">negotiations</text>
  <text start="717.089" dur="5.581">they are still pushing towards their</text>
  <text start="719.339" dur="5.641">goal they want Assad out they want to go</text>
  <text start="722.67" dur="7.079">into Iran they haven&amp;#39;t given up people</text>
  <text start="724.98" dur="6.69">they&amp;#39;re still pushing their goal now</text>
  <text start="729.749" dur="5.611">something I find very interesting and</text>
  <text start="731.67" dur="5.969">it&amp;#39;s happening in England it&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="735.36" dur="4.229">in Ukraine it&amp;#39;s happening here in the US</text>

  <text start="949.549" dur="6.91">they voted to separate themselves from</text>
  <text start="953.399" dur="6.84">Ukraine and go along with Russia the</text>

  <text start="1112.7" dur="4.4">interesting about all of this is that</text>

  <text start="1117.1" dur="4.209">they</text>
  <text start="1118.34" dur="5.64">said that North Korea is getting ready</text>

  <text start="1148.4" dur="5.519">they&amp;#39;re saying yes separate satellite</text>
  <text start="1150.35" dur="5.939">images suggest North Korea well it looks</text>
  <text start="1153.919" dur="7.021">like they&amp;#39;re getting ready to launch</text>
  <text start="1156.289" dur="7.831">something during the inauguration now to</text>

  <text start="1164.12" dur="7.62">seems like they&amp;#39;re putting out the</text>
  <text start="1167.51" dur="6.75">propaganda maybe North Korea will launch</text>
  <text start="1171.74" dur="4.11">something or maybe the US will make it</text>
