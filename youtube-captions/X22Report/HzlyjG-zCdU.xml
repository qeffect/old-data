  <text start="123.05" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t like to report on those type of</text>
  <text start="124.399" dur="4.11">things now what we&amp;#39;re seeing at this</text>
  <text start="126.41" dur="5.07">point is that they&amp;#39;re trying to come up</text>
  <text start="128.509" dur="5.071">with excuses of why certain parts of the</text>
  <text start="131.48" dur="5.039">economy aren&amp;#39;t doing well and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="133.58" dur="5.79">like to touch on that too often like for</text>
  <text start="136.519" dur="5.431">housing for an example they like to say</text>
  <text start="139.37" dur="4.92">well since what Trump did with lumber</text>
  <text start="141.95" dur="5.22">carrots well lumber is going to be the</text>
  <text start="144.29" dur="5.97">problem now for the housing industry now</text>
  <text start="147.17" dur="5.849">number one us home builder DR Horton</text>
  <text start="150.26" dur="6.99">well they reported its slowest growth in</text>

  <text start="157.25" dur="4.2">are went are running well below their</text>
  <text start="159.65" dur="4.47">historic average and this is according</text>
  <text start="161.45" dur="4.709">to the data and they&amp;#39;re saying well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="164.12" dur="5.039">because of the lumber costs how they</text>
  <text start="166.159" dur="5.641">slightly picked up and this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="169.159" dur="4.921">having a problem no this is not why</text>
  <text start="171.8" dur="4.469">you&amp;#39;re having a problem the problem is</text>
  <text start="174.08" dur="4.29">is that people are losing their jobs</text>
  <text start="176.269" dur="4.5">left and right people have taken on</text>
  <text start="178.37" dur="5.55">part-time jobs and now those service</text>
  <text start="180.769" dur="4.681">jobs those retail jobs they are coming</text>
  <text start="183.92" dur="4.64">to an end</text>
  <text start="185.45" dur="6.6">is the problem so we&amp;#39;ve lost</text>
  <text start="188.56" dur="5.35">manufacturing we&amp;#39;ve lost retail and now</text>
  <text start="192.05" dur="3.93">the restaurant industry where the food</text>
  <text start="193.91" dur="3.84">and service jobs that were you know</text>
  <text start="195.98" dur="5.16">everyone was supposed to be getting that</text>
  <text start="197.75" dur="5.13">is starting to slow now of course when</text>
  <text start="201.14" dur="3.15">everyone thinks about the economy they</text>
  <text start="202.88" dur="2.55">think of the stock market and people say</text>
  <text start="204.29" dur="2.279">well when is it going to collapse when</text>
  <text start="205.43" dur="3.6">is it going to collapse as all ever</text>
  <text start="206.569" dur="4.111">people say because what they want to</text>
  <text start="209.03" dur="2.85">happen is they want to wake up the next</text>
  <text start="210.68" dur="3.72">morning they want to see the stock</text>
  <text start="211.88" dur="4.7">market crash and this signals the entire</text>
  <text start="214.4" dur="5.699">collapse of the economy but the economy</text>
  <text start="216.58" dur="7.06">does not collapse that way this is what</text>
  <text start="220.099" dur="7.23">a lot of people don&amp;#39;t understand and the</text>
  <text start="223.64" dur="7.17">same people who were in the year of 2005</text>
  <text start="227.329" dur="6">2006 2007 when people were talking about</text>
  <text start="230.81" dur="3.959">the economy collapsing when everything</text>
  <text start="233.329" dur="2.791">was going to come to an end the housing</text>
  <text start="234.769" dur="3.211">market was going to take a dive the</text>
  <text start="236.12" dur="3.6">credit market was going to take a dive</text>
  <text start="237.98" dur="3.75">people were going to lose their jobs</text>
  <text start="239.72" dur="3.299">people kept on saying when is it going</text>
  <text start="241.73" dur="2.55">to happen was it when is it going to</text>
  <text start="243.019" dur="3.181">happen when is it going to happen and</text>
  <text start="244.28" dur="3.239">then it finally happened and then of</text>
  <text start="246.2" dur="5.539">course you never hear from those people</text>
  <text start="247.519" dur="8.701">again the economy collapses over time</text>
  <text start="251.739" dur="7.81">each part collapses at its own time and</text>
  <text start="256.22" dur="6.72">all the pieces come together at the same</text>
  <text start="259.549" dur="6.24">time so let&amp;#39;s take a look at what has</text>
  <text start="262.94" dur="6.15">been happening we&amp;#39;ve been discussing</text>
  <text start="265.789" dur="5.401">retail now in the beginning people blame</text>
  <text start="269.09" dur="4.86">this on the weather people blame this on</text>
  <text start="271.19" dur="4.5">well you know retail is not doing well</text>
  <text start="273.95" dur="3.839">because everyone&amp;#39;s moving to online and</text>
  <text start="275.69" dur="5.97">everyone&amp;#39;s shopping online and we found</text>
  <text start="277.789" dur="6.781">out that that is completely fake what</text>
  <text start="281.66" dur="5.819">has happened over time is that people</text>
  <text start="284.57" dur="5.069">lost their jobs people continually lost</text>
  <text start="287.479" dur="4.231">their jobs the unemployment numbers were</text>
  <text start="289.639" dur="4.111">manipulated to make everyone believe</text>
  <text start="291.71" dur="4.5">that the unemployment market was very</text>
  <text start="293.75" dur="4.2">strong people were taking part time jobs</text>
  <text start="296.21" dur="4.25">which were counted as full-time jobs</text>
  <text start="297.95" dur="5.61">people dropped off the labor market</text>
  <text start="300.46" dur="4.69">because they just really didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="303.56" dur="5.13">work no they couldn&amp;#39;t find a job that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="305.15" dur="6.51">the problem and as we move forward we</text>
  <text start="308.69" dur="4.11">saw this situation get worse everyone</text>
  <text start="311.66" dur="2.879">said well we&amp;#39;re no longer a</text>
  <text start="312.8" dur="4.32">manufacturing company everything moved</text>
  <text start="314.539" dur="4.891">into the service industry now that is</text>
  <text start="317.12" dur="4.26">coming to an end</text>
  <text start="319.43" dur="4.89">when you start putting these pieces</text>
  <text start="321.38" dur="5.61">together it affects everything else this</text>
  <text start="324.32" dur="5.099">then affected retail retail couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="326.99" dur="5.01">survive because people don&amp;#39;t have extra</text>
  <text start="329.419" dur="6.391">income to spend in retail this is why</text>
  <text start="332" dur="5.729">you see stores closing people said well</text>
  <text start="335.81" dur="6.12">what about housing housing is still</text>
  <text start="337.729" dur="6.361">strong really only in 20 cities the rest</text>
  <text start="341.93" dur="4.799">of the country they&amp;#39;re just getting by</text>
  <text start="344.09" dur="4.29">and now we&amp;#39;ve reached the height of the</text>
  <text start="346.729" dur="5.25">bubble actually we surpassed the bubble</text>
  <text start="348.38" dur="5.13">of 2006-2007 and now it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="351.979" dur="3.06">come down and housing prices aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="353.51" dur="4.29">doing that well and in many areas</text>
  <text start="355.039" dur="4.291">outside of the 20 cities there are</text>
  <text start="357.8" dur="4.26">houses for sale that have been on the</text>
  <text start="359.33" dur="5.97">market 8 9 months and the prices are</text>
  <text start="362.06" dur="8.28">coming down all of these things add up</text>
  <text start="365.3" dur="7.98">to the collapse when you see federal tax</text>
  <text start="370.34" dur="4.68">receipts when you see state tax receipts</text>
  <text start="373.28" dur="4.74">coming in and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="375.02" dur="4.95">dropping this is another son because</text>
  <text start="378.02" dur="6.69">that relates and that goes right into</text>
  <text start="379.97" dur="6.3">the forecast of the number of jobs as we</text>
  <text start="384.71" dur="4.829">can say people are losing their jobs</text>
  <text start="386.27" dur="6.81">people are taking less paying jobs that</text>
  <text start="389.539" dur="5.611">means less tax receipts are coming in to</text>
  <text start="393.08" dur="4.68">the government this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="395.15" dur="5.699">we&amp;#39;re seeing so when you look at this</text>
  <text start="397.76" dur="5.909">you can see that the economy has been</text>
  <text start="400.849" dur="5.641">collapsing yes did we get the stock</text>
  <text start="403.669" dur="4.891">market coming down where the Fed where</text>
  <text start="406.49" dur="4.169">the news agencies and everyone else can</text>
  <text start="408.56" dur="6.06">say yeah we&amp;#39;ve got a major problem at</text>
  <text start="410.659" dur="7.591">that point it is too late there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="414.62" dur="7.26">nothing you can do at that point and the</text>
  <text start="418.25" dur="7.62">economy didn&amp;#39;t crash at that point the</text>
  <text start="421.88" dur="7.44">economy crashed way before that this is</text>
  <text start="425.87" dur="6.299">the only thing left that the Fed has now</text>
  <text start="429.32" dur="4.529">the Fed decided that hey we&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="432.169" dur="3.87">to raise rates right now we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="433.849" dur="5.731">start our unwinding of our balance sheet</text>
  <text start="436.039" dur="5.031">very very soon this is what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="439.58" dur="5.64">in the past</text>
  <text start="441.07" dur="6.19">they are watching looking at the economy</text>
  <text start="445.22" dur="4.83">they already know it&amp;#39;s coming apart I</text>
  <text start="447.26" dur="5.19">mean we&amp;#39;ve had the weakest data that</text>
  <text start="450.05" dur="3.28">we&amp;#39;ve ever seen and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="452.45" dur="2.74">saying well</text>
  <text start="453.33" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;ve been waiting for inflation to rise</text>
  <text start="455.19" dur="4.469">but it is much weaker right now not if</text>
  <text start="457.59" dur="4.139">you go to the supermarket you can see</text>
  <text start="459.659" dur="4.681">fresh foods and things like that over a</text>
  <text start="461.729" dur="6.331">long period of time those prices have</text>
  <text start="464.34" dur="6.329">gone up and what the Fed has been doing</text>
  <text start="468.06" dur="5.03">is they&amp;#39;ve been taking the inflation and</text>
  <text start="470.669" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;ve been shipping it overseas</text>
  <text start="473.09" dur="2.919">they&amp;#39;ve been putting into the stock</text>
  <text start="475.409" dur="2.431">market</text>
  <text start="476.009" dur="4.201">they&amp;#39;ve been putting it into the housing</text>
  <text start="477.84" dur="4.35">market and basically what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="480.21" dur="4.65">doing is they&amp;#39;re making sure that people</text>
  <text start="482.19" dur="6.449">don&amp;#39;t realize what is really going on we</text>
  <text start="484.86" dur="6.51">are seeing inflation right now if you</text>
  <text start="488.639" dur="4.411">know where to look and what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="491.37" dur="3.509">happen is all this inflation that</text>
  <text start="493.05" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;ve been shoving everywhere else</text>
  <text start="494.879" dur="5.94">because remember during the stimulus</text>
  <text start="497.34" dur="6.03">what they&amp;#39;ve done was they created all</text>
  <text start="500.819" dur="5.31">of this currency but they didn&amp;#39;t let it</text>
  <text start="503.37" dur="4.38">out into the public they kept it within</text>
  <text start="506.129" dur="3.901">the banking system they kept it within</text>
  <text start="507.75" dur="4.409">the stock market they kept all that</text>
  <text start="510.03" dur="4.53">money that they were creating in the</text>
  <text start="512.159" dur="3.481">housing market they took that money they</text>
  <text start="514.56" dur="4.859">were creating and they shipped it</text>
  <text start="515.64" dur="6.99">overseas this is how they kept inflation</text>
  <text start="519.419" dur="5.761">down they&amp;#39;ve done this on purpose they</text>
  <text start="522.63" dur="4.86">didn&amp;#39;t let this currency hit the public</text>
  <text start="525.18" dur="4.59">because if it hit the public it would be</text>
  <text start="527.49" dur="5.19">a disaster right now and they know</text>
  <text start="529.77" dur="4.35">eventually all of this currency that</text>
  <text start="532.68" dur="3.45">they shipped all over the place shoved</text>
  <text start="534.12" dur="2.459">into the market shoved into the housing</text>
  <text start="536.13" dur="2.399">market</text>
  <text start="536.579" dur="4.051">well it&amp;#39;s eventually going to hit the</text>
  <text start="538.529" dur="3.721">public all these dollars are going to</text>
  <text start="540.63" dur="4.29">come back and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="542.25" dur="5.1">now is that every time they been you</text>
  <text start="544.92" dur="4.68">know raising the interest rates they had</text>
  <text start="547.35" dur="5.22">this rate hike we&amp;#39;ve seen the dollar</text>
  <text start="549.6" dur="7.59">collapse remember the dollar has dropped</text>
  <text start="552.57" dur="7.17">around 8% year-to-date and we can see</text>
  <text start="557.19" dur="6.17">already that after the last two Fed</text>
  <text start="559.74" dur="7.14">hikes what we&amp;#39;ve seen is that the dollar</text>
  <text start="563.36" dur="6.43">continually declines it&amp;#39;s not moving up</text>
  <text start="566.88" dur="5.79">it is declining right now again the US</text>
  <text start="569.79" dur="5.64">dollar well it is set to collapse and as</text>
  <text start="572.67" dur="7.26">it does inflation plays will be</text>
  <text start="575.43" dur="6.21">exploding higher and we need to remember</text>
  <text start="579.93" dur="4.8">what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="581.64" dur="4.41">remember yesterday the IMF already put</text>
  <text start="584.73" dur="2.37">out there that they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="586.05" dur="3.03">moving</text>
  <text start="587.1" dur="3.84">most likely to China which they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="589.08" dur="4.41">to do a lot sooner than everyone thinks</text>
  <text start="590.94" dur="5.22">we also need to remember that China is</text>
  <text start="593.49" dur="5.4">making bilateral deals with all these</text>
  <text start="596.16" dur="4.92">countries they&amp;#39;re establishing the Silk</text>
  <text start="598.89" dur="4.02">Road the belt and road system where</text>
  <text start="601.08" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re going to have trade and right</text>
  <text start="602.91" dur="3.84">now the United States is completely left</text>
  <text start="604.71" dur="3.84">out of that yes Trump did send a</text>
  <text start="606.75" dur="4.05">representative to the belt and Road</text>
  <text start="608.55" dur="4.47">conference because he does know he</text>
  <text start="610.8" dur="4.62">understands that the United States is</text>
  <text start="613.02" dur="4.71">going to need trade with other countries</text>
  <text start="615.42" dur="4.47">this is why he&amp;#39;s establishing trade with</text>
  <text start="617.73" dur="4.02">the UK this is why he&amp;#39;s trying to bring</text>
  <text start="619.89" dur="3.96">back manufacturing this is why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="621.75" dur="5.07">trying to keep jobs in America because</text>
  <text start="623.85" dur="5.7">we can&amp;#39;t have manufacturing out in China</text>
  <text start="626.82" dur="4.05">out in other countries it has to be here</text>
  <text start="629.55" dur="4.38">in the United Sates because think about</text>
  <text start="630.87" dur="5.82">it when we transition into a new system</text>
  <text start="633.93" dur="4.98">we don&amp;#39;t have manufacturing we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="636.69" dur="5.64">have retail we don&amp;#39;t have the service</text>
  <text start="638.91" dur="5.78">industry what is the United States going</text>
  <text start="642.33" dur="5.67">to be it&amp;#39;s going to be absolutely</text>
  <text start="644.69" dur="6.31">nothing the only way you can survive is</text>
  <text start="648" dur="6.81">if you&amp;#39;re producing something if we</text>
  <text start="651" dur="5.07">produce nothing and all the other</text>
  <text start="654.81" dur="4.68">countries around the world have</text>
  <text start="656.07" dur="5.76">manufacturing and all the jobs are out</text>
  <text start="659.49" dur="5.22">in the emerging market all the jobs are</text>
  <text start="661.83" dur="4.47">out someplace else well what are the</text>
  <text start="664.71" dur="3.69">people the United States going to do</text>
  <text start="666.3" dur="6.21">because over the many years we just been</text>
  <text start="668.4" dur="7.38">consuming we haven&amp;#39;t been producing now</text>
  <text start="672.51" dur="5.01">we need to produce and without bringing</text>
  <text start="675.78" dur="4.32">all this back during the transition</text>
  <text start="677.52" dur="5.46">period the United States will not be</text>
  <text start="680.1" dur="4.71">able to survive and this is what the</text>
  <text start="682.98" dur="4.52">deep State has done over the many years</text>
  <text start="684.81" dur="6.15">they stripped United States of</text>
  <text start="687.5" dur="6.76">everything and we&amp;#39;re left with nothing</text>
  <text start="690.96" dur="6.15">right now and this is the main problem</text>
  <text start="694.26" dur="4.82">because how do you solve this in a short</text>
  <text start="697.11" dur="5.76">period of time it&amp;#39;s very very difficult</text>
  <text start="699.08" dur="5.29">so going forward it&amp;#39;s going to be a very</text>
  <text start="702.87" dur="3.54">difficult time through this transition</text>
  <text start="704.37" dur="4.08">period I mean this is not going to be a</text>
  <text start="706.41" dur="4.68">two-month riemann type of transition</text>
  <text start="708.45" dur="5.19">maybe the beginning part the roughest</text>
  <text start="711.09" dur="6.24">part might be within the six-month time</text>
  <text start="713.64" dur="6.69">period but past that this is going to</text>
  <text start="717.33" dur="3.63">take some time to bring back the jobs to</text>
  <text start="720.33" dur="3.54">bring back</text>
  <text start="720.96" dur="6.27">and you&amp;#39;re factoring to reboot the</text>
  <text start="723.87" dur="5.37">system because like I said the deep</text>
  <text start="727.23" dur="7.14">state the neocons the central bank</text>
  <text start="729.24" dur="8.61">they&amp;#39;ve had decades and decades of time</text>
  <text start="734.37" dur="8.19">to destroy the u.s. to set everything up</text>
  <text start="737.85" dur="7.77">for their globalist agenda I mean think</text>
  <text start="742.56" dur="5.82">about we were at the last stages of them</text>
  <text start="745.62" dur="4.8">setting up globalism where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="748.38" dur="4.47">bringing in refugees blending all the</text>
  <text start="750.42" dur="5.49">countries together getting ready and</text>
  <text start="752.85" dur="5.61">prepared to centralize pretty much</text>
  <text start="755.91" dur="4.47">everything to give all the power to the</text>
  <text start="758.46" dur="5.37">banking industry all the power to the</text>
  <text start="760.38" dur="5.1">corporation&amp;#39;s with the TPP the TTIP this</text>
  <text start="763.83" dur="5.58">is what they were preparing for this was</text>
  <text start="765.48" dur="8.67">the last step to have a court system</text>
  <text start="769.41" dur="7.71">that overruled the governments of every</text>
  <text start="774.15" dur="6.54">single country and all of this is being</text>
  <text start="777.12" dur="5.16">unwound right now and this is going to</text>
  <text start="780.69" dur="4.5">take some time this is not something you</text>
  <text start="782.28" dur="4.68">can just do overnight and this period of</text>
  <text start="785.19" dur="3.72">time that we&amp;#39;re going to be in it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="786.96" dur="3.78">going to be a long period of time this</text>
  <text start="788.91" dur="3.51">is why we&amp;#39;ve been saying get prepared</text>
  <text start="790.74" dur="5.01">this is why we&amp;#39;ve been saying get ready</text>
  <text start="792.42" dur="5.97">make sure you have food supplies cash on</text>
  <text start="795.75" dur="5.34">hand gold and silver to retain your</text>
  <text start="798.39" dur="4.17">wealth it&amp;#39;s insurance policy because</text>
  <text start="801.09" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re going to go through this period</text>
  <text start="802.56" dur="4.92">and it&amp;#39;s going to be very difficult just</text>
  <text start="804.69" dur="4.2">like when we came on to the system many</text>
  <text start="807.48" dur="4.2">people don&amp;#39;t remember a lot of people</text>
  <text start="808.89" dur="4.77">were out of work government jobs well</text>
  <text start="811.68" dur="5.07">they really didn&amp;#39;t exist teaching jobs</text>
  <text start="813.66" dur="5.61">very hard to find yeah there was</text>
  <text start="816.75" dur="4.71">inflation all over the place</text>
  <text start="819.27" dur="3.87">wages were all being readjusted and this</text>
  <text start="821.46" dur="4.59">is when we were coming on to a new</text>
  <text start="823.14" dur="5.94">system coming off the gold standard now</text>
  <text start="826.05" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;re in 20 trillion plus dollars in</text>
  <text start="829.08" dur="3">debt I&amp;#39;m not talking about all the</text>
  <text start="830.61" dur="4.17">unfunded liabilities and all that kind</text>
  <text start="832.08" dur="5.19">of stuff but let&amp;#39;s just use the number</text>
  <text start="834.78" dur="4.32">twenty trillion we&amp;#39;re in so much debt</text>
  <text start="837.27" dur="3.72">right now but at the federal tax</text>
  <text start="839.1" dur="4.53">receipts the state tax receipts they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="840.99" dur="4.83">barely making the payments on the</text>
  <text start="843.63" dur="3.69">interest of this debt comment&amp;#39; if the</text>
  <text start="845.82" dur="4.08">interest rates went up two three four</text>
  <text start="847.32" dur="5.7">five six seven percent it would be a</text>
  <text start="849.9" dur="4.71">complete disaster we&amp;#39;re at the end of</text>
  <text start="853.02" dur="4.35">the system right now and we</text>
  <text start="854.61" dur="7.59">have to do undo everything that the</text>
  <text start="857.37" dur="7.44">globalists have done over time and this</text>
  <text start="862.2" dur="6.18">is the beginning process of all of this</text>
  <text start="864.81" dur="6.089">and they&amp;#39;re going to fight all the way</text>
  <text start="868.38" dur="5.61">to the end because they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="870.899" dur="4.56">let go of their old system they want to</text>
  <text start="873.99" dur="4.02">keep it they make a lot of money with</text>
  <text start="875.459" dur="5.791">their old system the lobbyists the</text>
  <text start="878.01" dur="5.13">corporation&amp;#39;s the central bank all this</text>
  <text start="881.25" dur="3.12">money is just flowing around why do you</text>
