  <text start="214.97" dur="8.98">we see that everything is falling apart</text>
  <text start="219.42" dur="6.39">their system is imploding and the only</text>
  <text start="223.95" dur="6.869">way out of this the only way to cover it</text>
  <text start="225.81" dur="7.86">up is to have war once again and we are</text>
  <text start="230.819" dur="5.971">headed in this direction and when this</text>
  <text start="233.67" dur="5.099">next event false flag occurs they are</text>
  <text start="236.79" dur="4.08">once again going to lie to the people</text>
  <text start="238.769" dur="3.961">let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="240.87" dur="4.38">collapse news now we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="242.73" dur="4.2">retail contract and a lot of the private</text>
  <text start="245.25" dur="5.01">wasn&amp;#39;t central bank countries Australia</text>
  <text start="246.93" dur="4.98">for instance MasterCard just released</text>
  <text start="250.26" dur="4.44">their latest spending pulse report and</text>
  <text start="251.91" dur="6.12">it shows that retail sales fell by 0.1%</text>
  <text start="254.7" dur="6.779">in April and what they&amp;#39;re reporting on</text>
  <text start="258.03" dur="6.33">is that retail spending it&amp;#39;s half of</text>
  <text start="261.479" dur="5.521">what it was a year ago right now what</text>
  <text start="264.36" dur="5.88">we&amp;#39;re seeing is a decline in the growth</text>
  <text start="267" dur="5.16">rate and we&amp;#39;re seeing this in many of</text>
  <text start="270.24" dur="3.81">the private western central bank</text>
  <text start="272.16" dur="5.55">countries where we&amp;#39;re seeing retail</text>
  <text start="274.05" dur="6.39">contract here in the United States this</text>
  <text start="277.71" dur="4.5">is continuing yesterday in the news</text>
  <text start="280.44" dur="4.229">brief I mentioned about real estate and</text>
  <text start="282.21" dur="5.04">how a lot of the prices are starting to</text>
  <text start="284.669" dur="5.011">come down a lot of the inventory is</text>
  <text start="287.25" dur="4.5">being left on the market a lot of</text>
  <text start="289.68" dur="4.38">individuals speculators are trying to</text>
  <text start="291.75" dur="5.73">get out of the real estate market and</text>
  <text start="294.06" dur="5.1">very interestingly Sam Zell</text>
  <text start="297.48" dur="4.41">he isn&amp;#39;t buying the hype that the real</text>
  <text start="299.16" dur="5.82">estate market is doing well in fact what</text>
  <text start="301.89" dur="8.09">he&amp;#39;s doing right now is he is selling</text>
  <text start="304.98" dur="8.28">now remember back in 2007 he knew that</text>
  <text start="309.98" dur="4.36">things were heading south where</text>
  <text start="313.26" dur="3.48">everything was starting to decline</text>
  <text start="314.34" dur="5.37">things were really starting to look bad</text>
  <text start="316.74" dur="7.02">so what he did at that point he sold his</text>
  <text start="319.71" dur="5.91">commercial property and he sold equity</text>
  <text start="323.76" dur="4.68">office properties trust to Blackstone</text>
  <text start="325.62" dur="5.49">for 23 billion not including 16 billion</text>
  <text start="328.44" dur="5.28">in debt then prices all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="331.11" dur="8.3">crashed and commercial property defaults</text>
  <text start="333.72" dur="9.06">hit the banks and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="339.41" dur="5.65">he is doing the same exact thing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="342.78" dur="5.73">unloading his multifamily properties at</text>
  <text start="345.06" dur="5.82">peak prices at a massive scale because</text>
  <text start="348.51" dur="6.42">what he is saying at this point is that</text>
  <text start="350.88" dur="6.18">real estate it is at the top it is</text>
  <text start="354.93" dur="4.14">falling right now it&amp;#39;s time to get at</text>
  <text start="357.06" dur="7.83">the market because we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="359.07" dur="9.18">real estate plummet implode and crash</text>
  <text start="364.89" dur="5.16">and this is exactly what I&amp;#39;m saying when</text>
  <text start="368.25" dur="3.36">I look around the country when we look</text>
  <text start="370.05" dur="3.68">at all the different markets we see</text>
  <text start="371.61" dur="5.13">things really starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="373.73" dur="4">real estate is not doing what the</text>
  <text start="376.74" dur="2.64">corporate media what the US government</text>
  <text start="377.73" dur="3.54">central bankers are trying to tell us</text>
  <text start="379.38" dur="3.63">it&amp;#39;s doing it&amp;#39;s actually doing the</text>
  <text start="381.27" dur="4.38">opposite and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="383.01" dur="5.52">continually pushing the idea that retail</text>
  <text start="385.65" dur="4.77">real estate GDP are doing so well</text>
  <text start="388.53" dur="5.94">because when things start to really fall</text>
  <text start="390.42" dur="7.47">apart they push the propaganda to</text>
  <text start="394.47" dur="7.92">maximum they need everyone to believe</text>
  <text start="397.89" dur="6.87">that everything is doing well now Russia</text>
  <text start="402.39" dur="5.19">and China they&amp;#39;re going to start</text>
  <text start="404.76" dur="4.47">developing joint media projects in order</text>
  <text start="407.58" dur="4.11">to provide business people with actual</text>
  <text start="409.23" dur="4.89">information on the financial issues</text>
  <text start="411.69" dur="5.58">related to the activities of these stock</text>
  <text start="414.12" dur="4.41">exchanges and what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="417.27" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re proposing to create a joint</text>
  <text start="418.53" dur="7.41">information project which will focus on</text>
  <text start="421.98" dur="5.46">stocks just like we have our financial</text>
  <text start="425.94" dur="3.24">channels here in the United States with</text>
  <text start="427.44" dur="4.52">Wall Street well they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="429.18" dur="4.76">counter this to show the real</text>
  <text start="431.96" dur="5.19">picture of what is really going on and</text>
  <text start="433.94" dur="5.43">we can see already everything is moving</text>
  <text start="437.15" dur="6.09">from the west to the east at this point</text>
  <text start="439.37" dur="7.5">as the west as the system dies as the</text>
  <text start="443.24" dur="6.45">dollar comes to its its end here we see</text>
  <text start="446.87" dur="5.04">the East with Russia and China they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="449.69" dur="4.289">continually bypassing the dollar they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="451.91" dur="4.47">setting up alternative payment systems</text>
  <text start="453.979" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re bypassing the Swiss system and</text>
  <text start="456.38" dur="5.849">they&amp;#39;re continually doing all of this</text>
  <text start="458.599" dur="6.54">because countries are starting to</text>
  <text start="462.229" dur="5.881">realize that the dollar is at its end</text>
  <text start="465.139" dur="4.951">game here and we can see that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.11" dur="5.429">just way too much debt around the world</text>
  <text start="470.09" dur="5.25">the central banking system only works as</text>
  <text start="473.539" dur="4.711">you continually push out more and more</text>
  <text start="475.34" dur="6.06">debt and what we&amp;#39;re seeing at this point</text>
  <text start="478.25" dur="5.13">is that they&amp;#39;re having a very difficult</text>
  <text start="481.4" dur="3.48">time continually pushing dead out</text>
  <text start="483.38" dur="4.86">because the only way they can do this is</text>
  <text start="484.88" dur="8.7">to go into a country overthrow the</text>
  <text start="488.24" dur="6.69">government&amp;#39;s put them into debt and then</text>
  <text start="493.58" dur="4.2">start stealing their natural resources</text>
  <text start="494.93" dur="5.43">and we see they&amp;#39;re still trying to do</text>
  <text start="497.78" dur="5.609">this in South America they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="500.36" dur="6.089">in the Middle East Ukraine wherever they</text>
  <text start="503.389" dur="4.65">possibly can now they normally go into</text>
  <text start="506.449" dur="5.96">the countries where there&amp;#39;s oil withers</text>
  <text start="508.039" dur="6.63">large deposits of copper lithium oil</text>
  <text start="512.409" dur="4.451">natural resources that they can use</text>
  <text start="514.669" dur="4.711">especially oil because they need to put</text>
  <text start="516.86" dur="3.989">the petro dollar on that system so this</text>
  <text start="519.38" dur="3.3">way more and more countries hold the</text>
  <text start="520.849" dur="3.541">petrol dollars in reserves but what</text>
  <text start="522.68" dur="3.719">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="524.39" dur="3.75">control the Middle East and things are</text>
  <text start="526.399" dur="4.171">starting to really rapidly fall apart</text>
  <text start="528.14" dur="4.53">there now we understand that the</text>
  <text start="530.57" dur="4.5">European nations they are bracing for</text>
  <text start="532.67" dur="4.8">this economic collapse we see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="535.07" dur="4.59">changing a lot of laws they&amp;#39;re enacting</text>
  <text start="537.47" dur="4.41">a lot of these draconian laws that take</text>
  <text start="539.66" dur="4.89">rights away from the people doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="541.88" dur="5.269">allow people to protest and just</text>
  <text start="544.55" dur="6.18">recently back i think was May 18th</text>
  <text start="547.149" dur="5.921">France you know introduced these labor</text>
  <text start="550.73" dur="3.99">laws and then we saw riots there but</text>
  <text start="553.07" dur="7.62">something very interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="554.72" dur="9.119">that US citizens they were the ones out</text>
  <text start="560.69" dur="4.93">there in the riots actually five men</text>
  <text start="563.839" dur="4.061">they were detained over</text>
  <text start="565.62" dur="4.73">the anti labor reform rights and powers</text>
  <text start="567.9" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;re accused of extreme violence</text>
  <text start="570.35" dur="6.37">assault on police cars and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="574.11" dur="6.18">saying is that these men were out there</text>
  <text start="576.72" dur="8.79">and they&amp;#39;re the ones who were smashing</text>
  <text start="580.29" dur="8.25">who were lighting fires and what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="585.51" dur="6.72">looking at right now is this most likely</text>
  <text start="588.54" dur="7.32">was an inside job people were sent over</text>
  <text start="592.23" dur="5.25">there cause problems because most of the</text>
  <text start="595.86" dur="3.99">other protesters that are out there were</text>
  <text start="597.48" dur="4.5">very peaceful and we see this happen</text>
  <text start="599.85" dur="3.75">quite often in all different areas we</text>
  <text start="601.98" dur="4.08">saw in Ferguson where there were people</text>
  <text start="603.6" dur="7.58">in black hoods actually they were police</text>
  <text start="606.06" dur="8.34">officers that were pushing the riots</text>
  <text start="611.18" dur="6.58">pushing the idea they should destroy</text>
  <text start="614.4" dur="4.83">things and people pointed them out so it</text>
  <text start="617.76" dur="4.32">looks like we&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing</text>
  <text start="619.23" dur="4.17">happen in France now out in Ukraine we</text>
  <text start="622.08" dur="4.53">see here in the corporate media of the</text>
  <text start="623.4" dur="6.71">United States they&amp;#39;re continually using</text>
  <text start="626.61" dur="8.07">the idea that Ukraine&amp;#39;s violence is</text>
  <text start="630.11" dur="6.28">ramping up and things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="634.68" dur="3.15">falling apart because it looks like what</text>
  <text start="636.39" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="637.83" dur="4.5">getting ready and prepared for what is</text>
  <text start="639.54" dur="5.31">coming and that is another war because</text>
  <text start="642.33" dur="4.92">we can see at this point Victoria Nuland</text>
  <text start="644.85" dur="3.9">already stated no there&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="647.25" dur="4.41">be any elections in the southeastern</text>
  <text start="648.75" dur="5.04">area Ukraine right now the only way they</text>
  <text start="651.66" dur="4.59">can have elections is to close the</text>
  <text start="653.79" dur="5.16">border allow the OSCE police into this</text>
  <text start="656.25" dur="4.47">area and we can see already that things</text>
  <text start="658.95" dur="5.16">are starting to break down and things</text>
  <text start="660.72" dur="5.64">are not looking good now we see the UK</text>
  <text start="664.11" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re going to be stockpiling tanks</text>
  <text start="666.36" dur="5.4">heavy equipment close to Russian to the</text>
  <text start="668.82" dur="5.03">Russian border and we see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="671.76" dur="4.829">going to be bringing all of this in and</text>
  <text start="673.85" dur="4.96">they&amp;#39;re going to provide an armored</text>
  <text start="676.589" dur="4.651">battle group which usually consists of</text>
  <text start="678.81" dur="3.899">about a thousand troops this is of</text>
  <text start="681.24" dur="3.36">course going to be back by tanks and</text>
  <text start="682.709" dur="5.331">artillery it&amp;#39;s going to be deployed to</text>
  <text start="684.6" dur="7.25">the Baltic region the other plans for</text>
  <text start="688.04" dur="6.28">Britain they&amp;#39;re going to stockpile other</text>
  <text start="691.85" dur="4.02">military hardware across the eastern</text>
  <text start="694.32" dur="4.98">europe and ramp up their air defenses</text>
  <text start="695.87" dur="6.19">and we can see that the u.s.</text>

  <text start="707.97" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;ve been doing this for quite a</text>
  <text start="709.44" dur="4.589">quite a while they&amp;#39;ve been moving their</text>
  <text start="711.69" dur="5.07">military assets their military troops</text>
  <text start="714.029" dur="6.271">into key positions around China in</text>
  <text start="716.76" dur="7.05">Africa in the Middle East and in Europe</text>
  <text start="720.3" dur="6.539">and this is continuing over time and</text>
  <text start="723.81" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s you know if you if we nobody was</text>
  <text start="726.839" dur="3.301">paying attention you would think whoa</text>
  <text start="728.37" dur="3.6">this just happened but we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="730.14" dur="3.66">following us for quite a while and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="731.97" dur="3.72">starting to realize and we knew from the</text>
  <text start="733.8" dur="4.05">beginning that this is the reason</text>
  <text start="735.69" dur="5.399">they&amp;#39;re continually doing this actually</text>
  <text start="737.85" dur="5.1">they were doing this even before they</text>
  <text start="741.089" dur="5.101">started using the word Russian</text>
  <text start="742.95" dur="4.949">aggression they encircle China they</text>
  <text start="746.19" dur="4.05">brought equipment into Eastern Europe</text>
  <text start="747.899" dur="6.961">and we were reporting on this way before</text>
  <text start="750.24" dur="6.39">this point in time now out in Libya we</text>
  <text start="754.86" dur="3.69">see the unity government they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="756.63" dur="4.32">struggling to make an impact in Libya</text>
  <text start="758.55" dur="6.029">the people there they&amp;#39;re just ignoring</text>
  <text start="760.95" dur="5.639">them and they&amp;#39;re not recognizing the</text>
  <text start="764.579" dur="4.591">unity government now of course what</text>
  <text start="766.589" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the unity</text>
  <text start="769.17" dur="4.94">government has international support of</text>
  <text start="771.029" dur="5.941">course because the u.s. the UN and</text>
  <text start="774.11" dur="4.33">France and UK and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="776.97" dur="3.84">countries are saying yes this is the</text>
  <text start="778.44" dur="5.97">government but the people inside of</text>
  <text start="780.81" dur="4.83">Libya they could care less this is not</text>
  <text start="784.41" dur="6.2">our government this is a government that</text>
  <text start="785.64" dur="9.24">you forced upon us we see out in Iraq in</text>
  <text start="790.61" dur="6.13">Fallujah the Iraqi forces they are in</text>
  <text start="794.88" dur="3.449">Fallujah they&amp;#39;re really making a</text>
  <text start="796.74" dur="4.17">difference there and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="798.329" dur="5.13">interesting is that we are now seeing</text>
  <text start="800.91" dur="5.94">that there are servicemen from the US</text>
  <text start="803.459" dur="9">load us-led coalition there on the front</text>
  <text start="806.85" dur="7.58">minds with the Iraqi soldiers now a</text>
  <text start="812.459" dur="4.351">Reuters correspondent saw soldiers</text>
  <text start="814.43" dur="5.8">loading armored vehicles outside the</text>
  <text start="816.81" dur="5.76">village of Hassan Shami and they told</text>
  <text start="820.23" dur="6.299">the reporters not to take photographs of</text>
  <text start="822.57" dur="8.66">what&amp;#39;s going on here and they said they</text>
  <text start="826.529" dur="6.601">spoke English look like us soldiers and</text>
  <text start="831.23" dur="4.42">even though the</text>
  <text start="833.13" dur="3.93">president and the spokes people in the</text>
  <text start="835.65" dur="3.95">US government continually telling us</text>
  <text start="837.06" dur="5.76">that no there are no boots on the ground</text>
  <text start="839.6" dur="4.99">they&amp;#39;re not in combat our soldiers we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="842.82" dur="4.08">starting to realize that yes they are in</text>
  <text start="844.59" dur="3.75">combat and it looks like the Obama</text>
  <text start="846.9" dur="2.82">administration is going to have to start</text>
  <text start="848.34" dur="4.02">to admit this and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="849.72" dur="4.89">starting to do this because the US has</text>
  <text start="852.36" dur="3.57">been intertwined into these forces for</text>
  <text start="854.61" dur="3.75">quite a while actually there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="855.93" dur="3.9">more forces in these areas than their</text>
  <text start="858.36" dur="4.17">actual reporting because you have to</text>
  <text start="859.83" dur="5.1">remember how they do this there are only</text>
  <text start="862.53" dur="4.95">allowed about 3,800 or so and change</text>
  <text start="864.93" dur="5.82">permanent troops but the rest of the</text>
  <text start="867.48" dur="5.64">troops there are temporary and they</text>
  <text start="870.75" dur="3.96">really don&amp;#39;t count those as being in</text>
  <text start="873.12" dur="5.25">Iraq this is why they always come up</text>
  <text start="874.71" dur="5.4">with a number of 3,800 or 4,000 actually</text>
  <text start="878.37" dur="3.09">they have close to almost 10,000</text>
  <text start="880.11" dur="2.94">probably even more than that because</text>
  <text start="881.46" dur="3.27">they say though these are temporary</text>
  <text start="883.05" dur="3.36">troops but there&amp;#39;s no expiration date</text>
  <text start="884.73" dur="4.35">this is how they get around the</text>
  <text start="886.41" dur="4.25">agreement they had with Iraq we see the</text>
  <text start="889.08" dur="5.46">Syrian opposition high negotiations</text>
  <text start="890.66" dur="6.28">committee the agency is reorganizing the</text>
  <text start="894.54" dur="3.86">negotiation team after their chief</text>
  <text start="896.94" dur="4.08">representative in the Geneva talks</text>
  <text start="898.4" dur="6.31">Mohammad alloush announced his decision</text>
  <text start="901.02" dur="8.07">to leave his post so he will no longer</text>
  <text start="904.71" dur="7.2">be supporting the moderate rebel people</text>
  <text start="909.09" dur="6.45">now as we know Russia and the Syrian</text>
  <text start="911.91" dur="5.64">armed forces are battling farakka the US</text>
  <text start="915.54" dur="4.17">did not join Russia even-odd Russia</text>
  <text start="917.55" dur="3.75">extended their hand the u.s. said no</text>
  <text start="919.71" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;re going to do this on our own and</text>
  <text start="921.3" dur="5.22">the question we have to continually ask</text>
  <text start="923.13" dur="5.91">ourselves why isn&amp;#39;t the u.s. cooperating</text>
  <text start="926.52" dur="6.51">with Russia why didn&amp;#39;t they go into</text>
  <text start="929.04" dur="6.33">rocca together well of course as we know</text>
  <text start="933.03" dur="4.83">the US has an ulterior motive in Syria</text>
  <text start="935.37" dur="5.04">and this is why does not want Russia or</text>
  <text start="937.86" dur="7.19">Damascus to assist with any type of</text>
  <text start="940.41" dur="6.96">operations the u.s. seems to be very</text>
  <text start="945.05" dur="4.66">intent on controlling the outcome of</text>
  <text start="947.37" dur="3.36">what happens in raka of course what</text>
  <text start="949.71" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re transferring</text>
  <text start="950.73" dur="4.23">the Islamic state away from raka to</text>
  <text start="952.89" dur="4.5">other areas and letting the Free Syrian</text>
  <text start="954.96" dur="6.87">Army the moderate rebels take control of</text>
  <text start="957.39" dur="7.47">this area and we have to remember the</text>
  <text start="961.83" dur="4.89">u.s. their entire plan of course is to</text>
  <text start="964.86" dur="3.659">remove Assad</text>
  <text start="966.72" dur="4.739">to split up the Middle East they want to</text>
  <text start="968.519" dur="4.471">divide Syria and this is why they joined</text>
  <text start="971.459" dur="4.5">up with the Kurdish forces because their</text>
  <text start="972.99" dur="5.18">main goal is to have a Kurdish region</text>
  <text start="975.959" dur="5.911">this is why the US is in that region</text>
  <text start="978.17" dur="5.769">supporting them and then we have turkey</text>
  <text start="981.87" dur="4.139">on the other side saying we need a safe</text>
  <text start="983.939" dur="3.991">zone for the refugees think about what</text>
  <text start="986.009" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re doing here one section they can</text>
  <text start="987.93" dur="3.18">say up this is the Kurdish region the</text>
  <text start="989.759" dur="2.851">other section they can say this is the</text>
  <text start="991.11" dur="4.11">safe zone for Refugees they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="992.61" dur="5.37">split it up into two areas and this is</text>
  <text start="995.22" dur="4.409">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do and the u.s.</text>
  <text start="997.98" dur="3.779">position has always been to try to</text>
  <text start="999.629" dur="7.02">create a situation where they would</text>
  <text start="1001.759" dur="6.901">partition Syria and then move forward</text>
  <text start="1006.649" dur="5.821">and partition the rest of the Middle</text>
  <text start="1008.66" dur="6.81">East and of course what the US would</text>
  <text start="1012.47" dur="6.75">like to do is control Rocca and maybe</text>
  <text start="1015.47" dur="6.15">use this and use the success for their</text>
  <text start="1019.22" dur="4.409">political purposes at the negotiations</text>
  <text start="1021.62" dur="3.12">in Geneva and we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="1023.629" dur="4.141">watch that situation very carefully</text>
  <text start="1024.74" dur="5.79">because we see Russia the Syrian Armed</text>
  <text start="1027.77" dur="5.49">Forces they are making huge gains in</text>
  <text start="1030.53" dur="5.36">Syria pushing out the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1033.26" dur="4.949">pushing them back and every play every</text>
  <text start="1035.89" dur="4.269">area where the Islamic state is pushed</text>
  <text start="1038.209" dur="4.5">away the United States is trying to</text>
  <text start="1040.159" dur="5.25">maneuver in with the Kurdish forces with</text>
  <text start="1042.709" dur="5.011">the moderate rebels with al-nusrah with</text>
  <text start="1045.409" dur="4.14">al-qaeda because they can morph back and</text>
  <text start="1047.72" dur="4.98">forth and pretend that yeah these are</text>
  <text start="1049.549" dur="5.281">all moderate soldiers now turkey they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1052.7" dur="5.31">proposed to join the United States in</text>
  <text start="1054.83" dur="5.099">special operations in Syria only if the</text>
  <text start="1058.01" dur="4.71">Kurdish fighters are excluded from the</text>
  <text start="1059.929" dur="4.921">offensive which is very interesting and</text>
  <text start="1062.72" dur="5.01">the turkish foreign minister also said</text>
  <text start="1064.85" dur="4.559">that the special forces from turkey can</text>
  <text start="1067.73" dur="5.069">join up with the u.s. France Britain and</text>
  <text start="1069.409" dur="6.181">Germany and they can move towards</text>
  <text start="1072.799" dur="5.51">toppling Assad now we know this is their</text>
  <text start="1075.59" dur="6.87">main goal but we have to remember one</text>
  <text start="1078.309" dur="7.901">very important point here none of these</text>
  <text start="1082.46" dur="8.219">countries were invited into Syria they</text>
  <text start="1086.21" dur="6.78">invaded a sovereign country and then</text>
  <text start="1090.679" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;re getting reports from activists of</text>

  <text start="1103.399" dur="7.14">number of accounts in Turkish based</text>
  <text start="1106.039" dur="7.02">banks and through these banks turkey</text>
  <text start="1110.539" dur="4.431">finances the NGOs whose main purpose is</text>
  <text start="1113.059" dur="6.271">to support the Syrian Revolution and</text>
  <text start="1114.97" dur="6.089">we&amp;#39;re realizing that turkey along with</text>
  <text start="1119.33" dur="4.14">the United States and coalition forces</text>
  <text start="1121.059" dur="5.261">they&amp;#39;re getting prepared for a major</text>

  <text start="1129.049" dur="7.531">now all around Aleppo and these fighters</text>
  <text start="1134.509" dur="5.071">were accompanied by trucks with arms</text>
  <text start="1136.58" dur="6.87">ammunition off-road vehicles large</text>
  <text start="1139.58" dur="7.099">Carroll caliber machine guns and we can</text>
  <text start="1143.45" dur="6.839">see right now they got into the country</text>
  <text start="1146.679" dur="6.161">because turkey and their artillery on</text>
  <text start="1150.289" dur="7.171">the border was firing giving them a path</text>
  <text start="1152.84" dur="10.89">into Syria and it&amp;#39;s clear that all these</text>
  <text start="1157.46" dur="8.73">actions show us that turkey and the US</text>
  <text start="1163.73" dur="5.039">and the coalition forces they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1166.19" dur="5.309">ready for something big here they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1168.769" dur="5.551">getting ready for a major offensive now</text>

  <text start="1185.389" dur="4.321">lights from emergency responders could</text>
  <text start="1187.279" dur="5.28">be seen nearby and what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1189.71" dur="5.699">is that there was a suspicious package</text>
  <text start="1192.559" dur="3.87">that was thrown over the fence now we</text>
  <text start="1195.409" dur="3.09">know they&amp;#39;re going to be raising the</text>
  <text start="1196.429" dur="4.98">fence and we can see each time this</text>
  <text start="1198.499" dur="4.591">occurs they add more security where they</text>

  <text start="1207.139" dur="3.87">have to raise the fence another five</text>
  <text start="1208.909" dur="4.35">feet I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if they</text>
