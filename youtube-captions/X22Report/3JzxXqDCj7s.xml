  <text start="39.96" dur="4.619">is the car and economic collapse news</text>
  <text start="42.239" dur="4.621">brief let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="44.579" dur="4.711">collapse news now as we know the central</text>
  <text start="46.86" dur="5.55">bankers they would like to get rid of</text>
  <text start="49.29" dur="6.93">cash and go to some type of electronic</text>
  <text start="52.41" dur="5.85">currency to keep that currency inside</text>
  <text start="56.22" dur="4.29">the banks because if it&amp;#39;s physical</text>
  <text start="58.26" dur="3.6">people have the ability to take it put</text>
  <text start="60.51" dur="2.549">it under their mattress they tap they</text>
  <text start="61.86" dur="3.929">have the ability to take it out of the</text>
  <text start="63.059" dur="5.161">bank and then the Ballon documents are</text>
  <text start="65.789" dur="5.22">kind of a waste of time and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="68.22" dur="4.53">starting to see calls out there at the</text>
  <text start="71.009" dur="3.661">ECB saying that we should get rid of the</text>
  <text start="72.75" dur="3.27">five hundred dollar euro note Larry</text>
  <text start="74.67" dur="4.89">Summers saying we should get rid of the</text>
  <text start="76.02" dur="6.81">hundred-dollar bill and we see at this</text>
  <text start="79.56" dur="6">point that Japan is moving towards</text>
  <text start="82.83" dur="5.39">something completely different and the</text>
  <text start="85.56" dur="4.83">war on cash just got really serious</text>
  <text start="88.22" dur="4.209">because what they&amp;#39;re trying to do at</text>
  <text start="90.39" dur="5.009">this point is they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="92.429" dur="5.101">everyone use their fingerprint to buy</text>
  <text start="95.399" dur="4.14">things so the government&amp;#39;s going to test</text>
  <text start="97.53" dur="4.319">this new system which will enable people</text>
  <text start="99.539" dur="4.44">to buy things at stores using only their</text>
  <text start="101.849" dur="6.421">fingerprints thus enabling full</text>
  <text start="103.979" dur="6.241">monitoring full control make sure they</text>
  <text start="108.27" dur="6.659">track every piece of spending or saving</text>
  <text start="110.22" dur="8.37">or anything like that using biometric</text>
  <text start="114.929" dur="5.61">data and they would like all foreign</text>
  <text start="118.59" dur="3.779">tourists to use their fingerprints as</text>
  <text start="120.539" dur="4.11">they enter the country now the question</text>
  <text start="122.369" dur="7.441">is where is all this information will be</text>
  <text start="124.649" dur="7.431">kept what are they tracking and this</text>
  <text start="129.81" dur="5.61">seems like this is a precursor to</text>
  <text start="132.08" dur="6.1">placing a chip in our arm because you</text>
  <text start="135.42" dur="4.5">know once one country does it this is</text>
  <text start="138.18" dur="5.13">going to spread to other countries and</text>
  <text start="139.92" dur="5.789">you&amp;#39;ll be tracked every single place not</text>
  <text start="143.31" dur="5.61">just for spending but this data will</text>
  <text start="145.709" dur="6.181">have to be traded with other countries</text>
  <text start="148.92" dur="6.81">and this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="151.89" dur="7.31">to push now we know the battle with the</text>
  <text start="155.73" dur="7.8">FBI and Apple kinda came to an end when</text>
  <text start="159.2" dur="6.19">they couldn&amp;#39;t get any traction on</text>
  <text start="163.53" dur="4.65">getting the keys to the kingdom and the</text>
  <text start="165.39" dur="4.2">FBI said ok we&amp;#39;re going to back off and</text>
  <text start="168.18" dur="3.45">all of a sudden a company appeared outta</text>
  <text start="169.59" dur="3.93">nowhere from Israel and said listen we</text>
  <text start="171.63" dur="3.9">have the ability to break into the phone</text>
  <text start="173.52" dur="3.6">but of course as we discuss much much</text>
  <text start="175.53" dur="3.6">earlier we already knew this was</text>
  <text start="177.12" dur="4.79">possible because John McAfee has already</text>
  <text start="179.13" dur="6.06">proved it but what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="181.91" dur="6.19">director Comey who&amp;#39;s so interesting and</text>
  <text start="185.19" dur="6.54">getting into the privacy of every single</text>
  <text start="188.1" dur="7.65">person he doesn&amp;#39;t want people spying on</text>
  <text start="191.73" dur="7.289">him he&amp;#39;s worried about people viewing</text>
  <text start="195.75" dur="6.09">him through the video camera on his</text>
  <text start="199.019" dur="7.951">computer so he places a piece of tape on</text>
  <text start="201.84" dur="8.85">his laptop now as we know the people who</text>
  <text start="206.97" dur="6.66">are in the government offices or above</text>
  <text start="210.69" dur="5.61">that who are trying to push certain laws</text>
  <text start="213.63" dur="5.46">on us laws pertaining to them are</text>
  <text start="216.3" dur="5.1">usually a little different they have one</text>
  <text start="219.09" dur="4.76">set of laws for the people and another</text>
  <text start="221.4" dur="5.88">set of laws for themselves case in point</text>
  <text start="223.85" dur="4.69">Obamacare as soon as that came out the</text>
  <text start="227.28" dur="2.459">government decided you know what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="228.54" dur="3.15">going to exempt ourselves from this</text>
  <text start="229.739" dur="5.011">actually the staffers who complained</text>
  <text start="231.69" dur="5.6">said okay what we&amp;#39;ll do well we won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="234.75" dur="6.239">allow this to happen to you either and</text>
  <text start="237.29" dur="6.25">we see right now this is continually</text>
  <text start="240.989" dur="4.56">happening where there are two separate</text>
  <text start="243.54" dur="3.81">laws and he&amp;#39;s very concerned about his</text>
  <text start="245.549" dur="3.78">privacy and he&amp;#39;s trying to make it seem</text>
  <text start="247.35" dur="4.08">like oh I saw someone else put a piece</text>
  <text start="249.329" dur="5.91">of tape on my camera so I did the same</text>
  <text start="251.43" dur="6.059">thing now we also see this with David</text>
  <text start="255.239" dur="3.961">Cameron who is calling for privacy about</text>
  <text start="257.489" dur="3.691">the Panama papers and his offshore</text>
  <text start="259.2" dur="4.44">accounts he&amp;#39;s saying oh the family</text>
  <text start="261.18" dur="5.34">matters are private but of course he</text>
  <text start="263.64" dur="5.279">passed bills that allowed people to or</text>
  <text start="266.52" dur="4.74">the government to spy on other people</text>
  <text start="268.919" dur="4.861">but and when it comes to them they like</text>
  <text start="271.26" dur="4.5">to keep their privacy now something very</text>
  <text start="273.78" dur="5.1">interesting just happen out in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="275.76" dur="5.61">the Prime Minister decided to resign</text>
  <text start="278.88" dur="5.01">that&amp;#39;s Prime Minister Yatsenyuk and we</text>
  <text start="281.37" dur="4.859">know Yatsenyuk was put into place by the</text>
  <text start="283.89" dur="5.01">US government the central bankers after</text>
  <text start="286.229" dur="6.961">the coup d&amp;#39;etat he was chosen way before</text>
  <text start="288.9" dur="5.639">the coup d&amp;#39;etat even occurred now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="293.19" dur="2.909">very interesting about all of this is</text>
  <text start="294.539" dur="2.91">that the resignation came at a time</text>
  <text start="296.099" dur="3.991">where the Dutch</text>
  <text start="297.449" dur="5.31">decided to vote down the referendum for</text>
  <text start="300.09" dur="5.49">Ukraine to join the EU so it looks like</text>
  <text start="302.759" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re trying to get rid of some people</text>
  <text start="305.58" dur="5.429">make it look a lot better and maybe</text>
  <text start="308.909" dur="5.79">convince the world that yes they can</text>
  <text start="311.009" dur="7.65">join the EU now this also happened</text>
  <text start="314.699" dur="5.731">during the panama paper leak so we see</text>
  <text start="318.659" dur="2.94">two things happening all at once and</text>
  <text start="320.43" dur="3.15">we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch this</text>
  <text start="321.599" dur="5.4">situation very carefully and see what</text>
  <text start="323.58" dur="6.269">occurs in Ukraine North Korea they had a</text>
  <text start="326.999" dur="5.901">massive internet outage for about three</text>
  <text start="329.849" dur="5.88">hours or so this is very suspicious</text>
  <text start="332.9" dur="4.989">maybe the whole entire thing was brought</text>
  <text start="335.729" dur="4.86">down so something to be plugged in and</text>
  <text start="337.889" dur="4.321">when it was turned back on there was no</text>
  <text start="340.589" dur="3.961">detection or anything like that because</text>
  <text start="342.21" dur="4.079">everything was booting up but we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="344.55" dur="4.049">to wait and see why they had this</text>
  <text start="346.289" dur="3.72">massive internet outage we know they</text>
  <text start="348.599" dur="3.211">have infrastructure problems and things</text>
  <text start="350.009" dur="5.46">like that but it&amp;#39;s just very interesting</text>
  <text start="351.81" dur="7.109">that it all came down at once now we</text>
  <text start="355.469" dur="4.831">know the human rights organization is</text>
  <text start="358.919" dur="4.08">looking into the case where a</text>
  <text start="360.3" dur="5.28">marketplace in yemen they were hit with</text>
  <text start="362.999" dur="5.1">us made bombs by saudi arabia and we</text>
  <text start="365.58" dur="5.669">know saudi arabia&amp;#39;s doing the bombing in</text>
  <text start="368.099" dur="5.1">yemen taking orders from the United</text>
  <text start="371.249" dur="4.38">States and the United States has come</text>
  <text start="373.199" dur="4.02">out and said we have no responsibility</text>
  <text start="375.629" dur="4.29">for what happened in Yemen whatsoever</text>
  <text start="377.219" dur="4.47">and the human rights organization is</text>
  <text start="379.919" dur="3.48">saying yeah you are responsible because</text>
  <text start="381.689" dur="6.391">you&amp;#39;re orchestrating what is going on in</text>
  <text start="383.399" dur="7.82">Yemen you&amp;#39;re also selling the bombs to</text>
  <text start="388.08" dur="5.489">Saudi Arabia and they&amp;#39;re using it on</text>
  <text start="391.219" dur="3.91">certain targets which the United States</text>
  <text start="393.569" dur="3.361">of course is pointing out saying please</text>
  <text start="395.129" dur="4.111">bomb this area please bomb that area and</text>
  <text start="396.93" dur="3.779">we see the United States does bomb</text>
  <text start="399.24" dur="2.639">civilian areas especially in those</text>
  <text start="400.709" dur="3.871">countries where they&amp;#39;re trying to remove</text>
  <text start="401.879" dur="5.34">the elected government or there are</text>
  <text start="404.58" dur="4.049">people in that country trying to push</text>
  <text start="407.219" dur="3.54">out the puppet government and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="408.629" dur="5.94">trying to make the entire country pay</text>
  <text start="410.759" dur="6.45">for that we see it happening in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="414.569" dur="4.44">we see it happening in Syria we&amp;#39;re now</text>
  <text start="417.209" dur="5.36">seeing it happen in Yemen it happened in</text>
  <text start="419.009" dur="7.171">Libya in libya and lebanon in iraq and</text>
  <text start="422.569" dur="7.51">this is a pattern that we&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="426.18" dur="4.949">seeing over and over now John Kerry came</text>
  <text start="430.079" dur="2.58">out and</text>
  <text start="431.129" dur="4.68">he was out there and we discussed this</text>
  <text start="432.659" dur="6.03">before he wanted I ran to help stop the</text>
  <text start="435.809" dur="6.66">wars in Syria to help stop the wars in</text>
  <text start="438.689" dur="8.16">Yemen and Iran came out and said well</text>
  <text start="442.469" dur="8.4">it&amp;#39;s really the u.s. that should stop in</text>
  <text start="446.849" dur="6.9">these areas and they said if the u.s.</text>
  <text start="450.869" dur="6.181">seeks stability it should leave the</text>
  <text start="453.749" dur="7.831">region and stop supporting terrorism in</text>
  <text start="457.05" dur="6.509">the area which I absolutely agree the</text>
  <text start="461.58" dur="5.729">United States supports al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="463.559" dur="7.23">al-nusrah the Islamic state and they use</text>
  <text start="467.309" dur="6.181">these forces as a proxy army to cause</text>
  <text start="470.789" dur="5.22">chaos wreak havoc in the region to</text>
  <text start="473.49" dur="4.439">remove governments and once those</text>
  <text start="476.009" dur="4.14">governments are removed a cover a puppet</text>
  <text start="477.929" dur="4.561">government is put into place and of</text>
  <text start="480.149" dur="3.87">course anyone who opposes those puppet</text>
  <text start="482.49" dur="4.5">governments the United States calls them</text>
  <text start="484.019" dur="5.91">al-qaeda which allows them to use that</text>
  <text start="486.99" dur="4.62">legislation that says if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="489.929" dur="4.26">al-qaeda in any of these countries or</text>
  <text start="491.61" dur="6">anywhere around the world they can use</text>
  <text start="494.189" dur="5.43">drones so I agree with this and we</text>
  <text start="497.61" dur="5.819">discussed this before it&amp;#39;s the United</text>
  <text start="499.619" dur="6.66">States that is pushing terrorism in this</text>
  <text start="503.429" dur="6.63">region all to support the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="506.279" dur="5.37">and the central bankers way of life now</text>
  <text start="510.059" dur="3.571">we see the unity government is taking</text>
  <text start="511.649" dur="5.161">more and more control of Libya at this</text>
  <text start="513.63" dur="7.949">point they have just formed an anti</text>
  <text start="516.81" dur="7.68">militia force what is that well we saw</text>
  <text start="521.579" dur="5.971">Ukraine create an anti-terrorism force</text>
  <text start="524.49" dur="4.94">they&amp;#39;re doing the same exact thing they</text>
  <text start="527.55" dur="3.99">want to crack down on militants bent on</text>
  <text start="529.43" dur="4.87">destabilizing the city basically</text>
  <text start="531.54" dur="5.25">translation is all those people who</text>
  <text start="534.3" dur="4.589">object to the unity government we have</text>
  <text start="536.79" dur="4.83">this force the secret police force now</text>
  <text start="538.889" dur="6.3">that will go out and remove those people</text>
  <text start="541.62" dur="5.339">and it&amp;#39;s called the special deterrence</text>
  <text start="545.189" dur="3.361">force and we see this happen in every</text>
  <text start="546.959" dur="3.12">single one of these countries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="548.55" dur="3.36">not going after the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="550.079" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re not going after al Qaeda all</text>
  <text start="551.91" dur="3.57">those people who don&amp;#39;t want the puppet</text>
  <text start="553.529" dur="5.151">government in there guess what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="555.48" dur="6.359">to happen they are going to be removed</text>
  <text start="558.68" dur="5.379">drones will be used and you&amp;#39;ll never</text>
  <text start="561.839" dur="3.3">hear from these people once again this</text>
  <text start="564.059" dur="5.25">is what these forces</text>
  <text start="565.139" dur="5.55">are used for now we understand the</text>
  <text start="569.309" dur="3.51">United States wants to bring in more</text>
  <text start="570.689" dur="4.11">troops into Iraq and we realize the</text>
  <text start="572.819" dur="3.721">agreement with a rack way that they have</text>
  <text start="574.799" dur="3">is that they&amp;#39;re only allowed certain</text>
  <text start="576.54" dur="3.659">number of troops in there like thirty</text>
  <text start="577.799" dur="4.801">eight hundred or so but the United</text>
  <text start="580.199" dur="3.72">States is working around that agreement</text>
  <text start="582.6" dur="6">by calling all the other troops</text>
  <text start="583.919" dur="7.38">temporary so we have 3800 plus another</text>
  <text start="588.6" dur="5.13">three thousand or so inside the country</text>
  <text start="591.299" dur="4.65">and the Iraqi Prime Minister saying eh</text>
  <text start="593.73" dur="3.99">you know something we are not requesting</text>
  <text start="595.949" dur="4.5">any more troops but the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="597.72" dur="6.059">continually sending them in now the u.s.</text>
  <text start="600.449" dur="5.67">is sending strategic bombers to Qatar</text>
  <text start="603.779" dur="5.701">they have sent b-52 bombers they have</text>
  <text start="606.119" dur="5.4">landed in guitar and these bombers are</text>
  <text start="609.48" dur="4.56">going to be used for the next offensive</text>
  <text start="611.519" dur="4.59">in the area of Libya it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="614.04" dur="5.25">used in the next offensive in Syria and</text>
  <text start="616.109" dur="5.4">Iraq and we can see things are really</text>
  <text start="619.29" dur="3.989">building up as the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="621.509" dur="5.79">being pushed out of this entire region</text>
  <text start="623.279" dur="5.31">especially Syria and also a rack we see</text>
  <text start="627.299" dur="3.32">that the United States and the coalition</text>
  <text start="628.589" dur="4.65">forces are building up more and more</text>
  <text start="630.619" dur="5.44">military assets in this region they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="633.239" dur="6.45">bringing in more troops they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="636.059" dur="6.15">more bombing runs and they&amp;#39;re increasing</text>
  <text start="639.689" dur="4.89">what we&amp;#39;ve seen in the past now this is</text>
  <text start="642.209" dur="3.93">a head scratcher because as Russia</text>
  <text start="644.579" dur="3.69">continually push out to the Islamic</text>
  <text start="646.139" dur="3.48">state and the Syrian Armed Forces take</text>
  <text start="648.269" dur="4.74">more and more of the territory back in</text>

  <text start="838.95" dur="3.69">can&amp;#39;t let the same thing happen again</text>
  <text start="840.48" dur="4.38">they know once the elections occur they</text>
  <text start="842.64" dur="4.38">know that people of Syria are going to</text>
  <text start="844.86" dur="3.81">look at Assad and call him a war hero</text>
  <text start="847.02" dur="3.24">they got rid of the Islamic state they</text>
  <text start="848.67" dur="4.32">got rid of al Qaeda they got rid of</text>
  <text start="850.26" dur="6.84">al-nusrah they liberated towns cities</text>
  <text start="852.99" dur="6.57">and they gave the country back to the</text>
  <text start="857.1" dur="4.98">people and the the US government central</text>
  <text start="859.56" dur="4.41">bankers they know this this is why</text>
  <text start="862.08" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re preparing for something huge</text>
  <text start="863.97" dur="5.16">this might be the last false flag that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="866.43" dur="5.94">we might see that brings us to war</text>
  <text start="869.13" dur="5.42">because we already see that out in</text>
  <text start="872.37" dur="6.15">Ukraine that cyber attack that occurred</text>
  <text start="874.55" dur="6.28">that was a test they were testing the</text>
  <text start="878.52" dur="4.38">system out to see if they can bring down</text>
  <text start="880.83" dur="3.21">the power because we know that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="882.9" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re going to do here in the United</text>
  <text start="884.04" dur="4.83">States most likely in many different</text>
  <text start="885.96" dur="6">areas throughout the world to prove that</text>
  <text start="888.87" dur="4.71">the Islamic state or Russia or China has</text>
  <text start="891.96" dur="3.81">the ability to do this because once they</text>
  <text start="893.58" dur="4.32">do some type of physical attack they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="895.77" dur="3.72">going to follow it up with other attacks</text>
  <text start="897.9" dur="3.93">and those are going to be cyber because</text>
  <text start="899.49" dur="4.71">they need the physical to get that fear</text>
  <text start="901.83" dur="5.1">from the people and then they can take</text>
  <text start="904.2" dur="3.99">that fear and use cyber attacks because</text>
  <text start="906.93" dur="3.63">remember cyber attacks aren&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="908.19" dur="4.65">physical it&amp;#39;s very hard to show unless</text>
  <text start="910.56" dur="5.67">you say oh look we had a physical attack</text>
  <text start="912.84" dur="5.46">and now China Russia stepped in and they</text>
  <text start="916.23" dur="5.1">took down the power they took down the</text>
  <text start="918.3" dur="4.56">financial system while the physical</text>
  <text start="921.33" dur="3.81">attacks were going on because they knew</text>

  <text start="925.14" dur="4.14">already there are reports coming out and</text>
  <text start="927.08" dur="5.35">they&amp;#39;re looking at the Ukraine cyber</text>
  <text start="929.28" dur="5.12">attack they have now completely blamed</text>
  <text start="932.43" dur="3.99">it on Russian government in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="934.4" dur="3.7">saying that they&amp;#39;re the ones who are</text>
  <text start="936.42" dur="3.69">responsible for taking the power out in</text>
  <text start="938.1" dur="4.26">Ukraine they have the ability they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="940.11" dur="4.8">using black energy and that is a piece</text>
  <text start="942.36" dur="5.13">of malware and we know that this came</text>
  <text start="944.91" dur="5.13">out many many years ago and many groups</text>
  <text start="947.49" dur="4.41">use this malware but of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="950.04" dur="3.96">trying to link this to Russia they want</text>
  <text start="951.9" dur="3.93">everyone to know who the enemies are</text>
  <text start="954" dur="4.8">going to be they want everyone to know</text>
  <text start="955.83" dur="5.34">who is going to make this happen because</text>
  <text start="958.8" dur="5.4">this entire system is coming down it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="961.17" dur="4.53">collapsing it&amp;#39;s accelerating just like</text>
  <text start="964.2" dur="2.53">we heard from David Stockman this is a</text>
  <text start="965.7" dur="3.43">dead cat bounce</text>
  <text start="966.73" dur="4.919">this is the part of the illusion and</text>
  <text start="969.13" dur="3.899">once that illusion stops and all of a</text>
  <text start="971.649" dur="4.321">sudden everything starts to crash once</text>
  <text start="973.029" dur="5.731">again they are running out of time they</text>
  <text start="975.97" dur="5.07">know this they need to do something to</text>
  <text start="978.76" dur="4.949">blame all of this on some other country</text>
  <text start="981.04" dur="4.53">some of the group and this is why as we</text>
  <text start="983.709" dur="3.961">go throughout this year it is going to</text>
  <text start="985.57" dur="3.81">get worse and worse as time goes on</text>
