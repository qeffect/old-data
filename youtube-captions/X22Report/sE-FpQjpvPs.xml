  <text start="144.64" dur="8.15">and understand what these deep state</text>
  <text start="149.079" dur="6.871">elite central bankers were planning and</text>
  <text start="152.79" dur="6.64">they&amp;#39;re not going along with it now we</text>
  <text start="155.95" dur="7.439">can see out in the UK the brexit was the</text>
  <text start="159.43" dur="5.73">first step let&amp;#39;s get rid of the EU we</text>
  <text start="163.389" dur="5.341">don&amp;#39;t want them involved in our code</text>
  <text start="165.16" dur="6.54">let&amp;#39;s separate ourselves so the UK went</text>
  <text start="168.73" dur="6.33">ahead and they had a referendum and they</text>
  <text start="171.7" dur="6.66">decided okay look we want a complete</text>
  <text start="175.06" dur="5.759">break from the EU this is what we voted</text>
  <text start="178.36" dur="4.56">for now may she&amp;#39;s been working on this</text>
  <text start="180.819" dur="3.931">plan for a very long time and she came</text>
  <text start="182.92" dur="5.36">up with a plan that does not benefit the</text>
  <text start="184.75" dur="6.78">people of the UK it benefits the EU and</text>
  <text start="188.28" dur="7.39">from this point we can see that her plan</text>
  <text start="191.53" dur="6.92">did not pass now the EU is saying that</text>
  <text start="195.67" dur="5.97">they are willing to give her more time</text>
  <text start="198.45" dur="6.4">they&amp;#39;ll extend the time but they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="201.64" dur="5.97">going to change the deal now again this</text>
  <text start="204.85" dur="4.919">puts us into limbo where there is no</text>
  <text start="207.61" dur="4.59">brexit this might be part of the plan we</text>
  <text start="209.769" dur="5.22">talked about this before we also</text>
  <text start="212.2" dur="6.95">understand that during this time that</text>
  <text start="214.989" dur="7.231">she&amp;#39;s gonna try to push her plan forward</text>
  <text start="219.15" dur="5.89">most likely this is not going to work</text>
  <text start="222.22" dur="5.48">because we saw how the vote was it was</text>
  <text start="225.04" dur="6.63">completely against her plan</text>
  <text start="227.7" dur="6.7">now since the globalists system is</text>
  <text start="231.67" dur="4.56">falling apart a lot of leaders decided</text>
  <text start="234.4" dur="3.899">they weren&amp;#39;t gonna be going to Davos</text>
  <text start="236.23" dur="3.09">Trump could care less about Davos he</text>
  <text start="238.299" dur="4.44">said out because of the shutdown</text>
  <text start="239.32" dur="5.25">I&amp;#39;m not going to Davos macron he is busy</text>
  <text start="242.739" dur="4.321">dealing with the yellow vests right now</text>

  <text start="247.06" dur="4.89">well I&amp;#39;m gonna have to cancel my trip to</text>
  <text start="249.519" dur="6.511">the World Economic Forum meeting in</text>

  <text start="258.31" dur="4.56">the global system together macron is in</text>
  <text start="261.07" dur="5.849">France trying to keep the global system</text>
  <text start="262.87" dur="6.57">together and all these leaders right now</text>
  <text start="266.919" dur="4.891">they&amp;#39;re trying to keep the globalists</text>
  <text start="269.44" dur="6.38">system together which means this tells</text>
  <text start="271.81" dur="8.82">you there is a natural movement</text>
  <text start="275.82" dur="8.56">happening right now and we know that the</text>
  <text start="280.63" dur="7.71">central banks are behind stopping this</text>
  <text start="284.38" dur="6.98">brexit for instance the IMF they came</text>
  <text start="288.34" dur="7.92">out and said listen a No Deal brexit is</text>
  <text start="291.36" dur="7.529">biggest risk to Britain&amp;#39;s economy so if</text>
  <text start="296.26" dur="5.33">there&amp;#39;s a No Deal their economy</text>
  <text start="298.889" dur="5.58">fail if there&amp;#39;s a referendum you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="301.59" dur="6.06">gonna see chaos we didn&amp;#39;t see it and by</text>
  <text start="304.469" dur="6.66">the way if there&amp;#39;s a No Deal brexit and</text>
  <text start="307.65" dur="6.799">they just break clean and free away from</text>
  <text start="311.129" dur="8.28">the EU the EU is the one that loses</text>
  <text start="314.449" dur="7.06">they&amp;#39;re having a problem not the UK the</text>
  <text start="319.409" dur="7.62">EU which is filled with non elected</text>
  <text start="321.509" dur="8.791">leaders their entire plan of a one</text>
  <text start="327.029" dur="6.151">currency one-world government of non</text>
  <text start="330.3" dur="5.16">elected leaders is completely falling</text>
  <text start="333.18" dur="5.18">apart right now why do you think Germany</text>
  <text start="335.46" dur="5.97">and France are looking to merge their</text>
  <text start="338.36" dur="4.63">infrastructure their economy because</text>
  <text start="341.43" dur="3.329">they&amp;#39;re trying to save this global</text>
  <text start="342.99" dur="4.639">system and it&amp;#39;s falling apart very very</text>
  <text start="344.759" dur="5.43">quickly now something very interesting</text>
  <text start="347.629" dur="4">since we&amp;#39;re in this shutdown we know</text>
  <text start="350.189" dur="3.391">there&amp;#39;s a lot of things not happening</text>
  <text start="351.629" dur="3.991">right now and we&amp;#39;ll be talking about a</text>
  <text start="353.58" dur="4.53">lot of that in the next report but</text>
  <text start="355.62" dur="4.379">what&amp;#39;s interesting is that Canada was</text>
  <text start="358.11" dur="4.619">out there and they&amp;#39;re saying that they</text>
  <text start="359.999" dur="7.29">cannot report their trade data because</text>
  <text start="362.729" dur="6.66">of the u.s. shutdown really so they</text>
  <text start="367.289" dur="5.731">don&amp;#39;t know what their trade data is if</text>
  <text start="369.389" dur="7.411">the United States has shut down it turns</text>
  <text start="373.02" dur="9.48">out Canada is entirely reliant on the US</text>
  <text start="376.8" dur="8.669">for its trade data each country has been</text>
  <text start="382.5" dur="7.199">using the other&amp;#39;s import data to produce</text>
  <text start="385.469" dur="5.97">its export statistics since 1990 US</text>
  <text start="389.699" dur="3.06">imports from Canada reported to US</text>
  <text start="391.439" dur="3.301">Customs and Border Protection are</text>
  <text start="392.759" dur="5.19">compiled by the US Census Bureau and</text>
  <text start="394.74" dur="6.179">sent to Statistics Canada to be used as</text>
  <text start="397.949" dur="7.95">statistics for Canada&amp;#39;s exports to the</text>
  <text start="400.919" dur="9.21">United States kind of odd but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="405.899" dur="7.5">watching right now is the complete reset</text>
  <text start="410.129" dur="6.47">of the economic system and this is the</text>
  <text start="413.399" dur="7.44">globalist elite the central banks to</text>
  <text start="416.599" dur="9.031">push this agenda forward what has to</text>
  <text start="420.839" dur="7.071">happen now out of final wake-up call</text>
  <text start="425.63" dur="4.53">this individual kind of lays out what</text>
  <text start="427.91" dur="5.52">they think is going to happen here and</text>
  <text start="430.16" dur="5.61">let me read part of this to you no real</text>
  <text start="433.43" dur="4.2">change can manifest in the economic</text>
  <text start="435.77" dur="4.14">prison nations until the fake debt owed</text>
  <text start="437.63" dur="4.71">to the central banks and all other banks</text>
  <text start="439.91" dur="4.77">is defaulted on these banks have to be</text>
  <text start="442.34" dur="3.78">audited and all assets belong to the</text>
  <text start="444.68" dur="3.51">nations have to be taken back from the</text>
  <text start="446.12" dur="4.02">people running this fraudulent scheme</text>
  <text start="448.19" dur="5.07">that has continuously entrapped people</text>
  <text start="450.14" dur="5.67">in fake wars and debt it will take great</text>
  <text start="453.26" dur="4.65">care to investigate audit and gain full</text>
  <text start="455.81" dur="4.98">control of the monetary system that is</text>
  <text start="457.91" dur="4.47">owned by a private corporation and its</text>
  <text start="460.79" dur="4.41">central banks throughout the world a</text>
  <text start="462.38" dur="5.49">complete audit of all the gold holdings</text>
  <text start="465.2" dur="4.77">of all central banks will need to be</text>
  <text start="467.87" dur="5.1">coordinated simultaneously because this</text>
  <text start="469.97" dur="5.16">gold is property of the populace once</text>
  <text start="472.97" dur="3.87">the central banks are audited and all</text>
  <text start="475.13" dur="3.93">their assets frozen by the respective</text>
  <text start="476.84" dur="4.92">Treasury Department&amp;#39;s it is recommended</text>
  <text start="479.06" dur="5.91">that the US and other corporate nations</text>
  <text start="481.76" dur="6.84">default on their debt to its corrupt</text>
  <text start="484.97" dur="5.31">private owners the plan is that the Fed</text>
  <text start="488.6" dur="3.84">and central banks will declare</text>
  <text start="490.28" dur="4.53">bankruptcy and the respective Treasuries</text>
  <text start="492.44" dur="4.71">will on behalf of the citizens seize all</text>
  <text start="494.81" dur="4.8">assets of the Federal Reserve and all</text>
  <text start="497.15" dur="4.68">the other central banks all these</text>
  <text start="499.61" dur="5.67">trillions in debt will either be dropped</text>
  <text start="501.83" dur="5.52">in the bankruptcy or the respective</text>
  <text start="505.28" dur="5.04">government&amp;#39;s Treasury can print useless</text>
  <text start="507.35" dur="5.129">fiat currency to pay the debt off it is</text>
  <text start="510.32" dur="3.51">important to understand that ending the</text>
  <text start="512.479" dur="4.351">central banks will not crash the</text>
  <text start="513.83" dur="4.86">currency bond or stock markets all three</text>
  <text start="516.83" dur="3.839">of those are controlled currently by the</text>

  <text start="520.669" dur="4.771">backdoor trading done by the ESF and the</text>
  <text start="523.219" dur="7.131">US Treasury it has been proven that the</text>
  <text start="525.44" dur="7.8">ESF controls all three free markets</text>
  <text start="530.35" dur="4.75">eventually Trump can end the US fiat</text>
  <text start="533.24" dur="3.93">currency and create a new currency with</text>
  <text start="535.1" dur="4.59">the basket of commodities to back it up</text>
  <text start="537.17" dur="5.16">including gold silver other precious</text>
  <text start="539.69" dur="4.62">metals and commodities the old Federal</text>
  <text start="542.33" dur="4.29">Reserve notes will become useless after</text>
  <text start="544.31" dur="5.25">a recall of old currency that weeds out</text>
  <text start="546.62" dur="5.4">money that has not been taxed by keeping</text>
  <text start="549.56" dur="4.74">it in offshore accounts and tax havens</text>
  <text start="552.02" dur="4.65">this action will immediately eradicate</text>
  <text start="554.3" dur="4.53">all offshore tax haven money illegal</text>
  <text start="556.67" dur="4.169">drug money stolen and laundered</text>
  <text start="558.83" dur="4.08">and currency held by foreign nations</text>
  <text start="560.839" dur="4.171">that has been siphoned out of countries</text>
  <text start="562.91" dur="4.14">illegally the new currency will be</text>
  <text start="565.01" dur="4.5">established after the hidden CIA gold</text>
  <text start="567.05" dur="6.33">and assets have been audited and seized</text>
  <text start="569.51" dur="6.93">by the US Treasury now we do understand</text>
  <text start="573.38" dur="5.43">that q has told us that gold will bring</text>
  <text start="576.44" dur="5.91">down the Fed we will be seeing a</text>
  <text start="578.81" dur="6">restructuring and we can see how this</text>
