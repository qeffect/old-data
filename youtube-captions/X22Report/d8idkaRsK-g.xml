  <text start="83.54" dur="6">the central bank the globalist system</text>
  <text start="86" dur="6.41">and once Trump and Patriots they got</text>
  <text start="89.54" dur="6.81">into office they started to work on this</text>
  <text start="92.41" dur="7.78">they got rid of the TPP that we</text>
  <text start="96.35" dur="5.64">negotiated NAFTA they got rid of many</text>
  <text start="100.19" dur="7.35">other trade deals and made new trade</text>

  <text start="111.92" dur="4.47">Trump and the Patriots they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="114.05" dur="6.3">rolling back a lot of regulations</text>
  <text start="116.39" dur="4.32">rolling back taxes rolling back quite a</text>
  <text start="120.35" dur="4.05">bit</text>
  <text start="120.71" dur="6.27">and the reason for all this is to</text>
  <text start="124.4" dur="6.3">prepare us from when the central bank</text>
  <text start="126.98" dur="7.14">system is pushed aside and we transition</text>
  <text start="130.7" dur="7.319">into a new economic system and we know</text>
  <text start="134.12" dur="6.24">going back to 1971 we went off the gold</text>
  <text start="138.019" dur="5.881">standard we went onto the Fiat system</text>
  <text start="140.36" dur="6.33">and the central bankers the deep state</text>
  <text start="143.9" dur="6.69">they push their agenda from that point</text>
  <text start="146.69" dur="7.2">on now of course back in 1913 this is</text>
  <text start="150.59" dur="6.09">when they came into power where they</text>
  <text start="153.89" dur="5.159">controlled the monetary system of the</text>
  <text start="156.68" dur="4.29">United States so they could set up the</text>
  <text start="159.049" dur="4.951">central bank system across</text>
  <text start="160.97" dur="6.51">the world and what did they do they</text>
  <text start="164" dur="5.52">created the IMF they created the biz</text>
  <text start="167.48" dur="6.06">they created the World Trade</text>
  <text start="169.52" dur="7.53">Organization the World Bank this was all</text>
  <text start="173.54" dur="7.95">being done on purpose throughout this</text>
  <text start="177.05" dur="9.41">period to eventually bring us into a</text>
  <text start="181.49" dur="9.63">Fiat system and have the central bankers</text>
  <text start="186.46" dur="9.7">the supreme rulers of the world this was</text>
  <text start="191.12" dur="7.86">the plan since 1913 and Trump in the</text>
  <text start="196.16" dur="6.6">Patriots they have been reversing all of</text>
  <text start="198.98" dur="7.68">this now if we go back to the 70s we had</text>
  <text start="202.76" dur="7.199">Paul Volcker with Nixon and we come to</text>
  <text start="206.66" dur="7.11">find out that Paul Volcker who was</text>
  <text start="209.959" dur="8.191">instrumental in bringing us from a gold</text>
  <text start="213.77" dur="8.7">standard onto a fiat system because of</text>
  <text start="218.15" dur="6.869">speculators and having a energy crisis</text>
  <text start="222.47" dur="3.989">during this period he was one of the</text>
  <text start="225.019" dur="4.051">architects he was one of those</text>
  <text start="226.459" dur="8.641">individuals that was part of all of this</text>
  <text start="229.07" dur="9">and he passed away at 92 and Trump of</text>
  <text start="235.1" dur="5.88">the Patriots they are continually</text>
  <text start="238.07" dur="7.29">pushing the plan for it they need to</text>
  <text start="240.98" dur="6.45">remove as much of the globalist system</text>
  <text start="245.36" dur="6.45">as they possibly can</text>
  <text start="247.43" dur="6.839">because in the end what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="251.81" dur="5.37">do is they&amp;#39;re going to go after the</text>
  <text start="254.269" dur="5.101">central bank establishment and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="257.18" dur="4.43">not the Federal Reserve it&amp;#39;s much much</text>
  <text start="259.37" dur="4.28">larger than that and we could see that</text>
  <text start="261.61" dur="5.38">Trump right now in his administration</text>
  <text start="263.65" dur="8.29">the Patriots they&amp;#39;re going after the</text>
  <text start="266.99" dur="7.679">World Trade Organization so the Supreme</text>
  <text start="271.94" dur="4.38">Court of world trade otherwise known as</text>
  <text start="274.669" dur="4.651">the appellate body of the World Trade</text>
  <text start="276.32" dur="5.97">Organization will cease functioning on</text>
  <text start="279.32" dur="6.3">Wednesday the court is supposed to have</text>
  <text start="282.29" dur="5.73">seven members but it currently has four</text>
  <text start="285.62" dur="6.78">vacancies with two more members retiring</text>
  <text start="288.02" dur="7.11">on Tuesday that leaves one active judge</text>
  <text start="292.4" dur="5.489">two short of the number required to rule</text>
  <text start="295.13" dur="7.289">on international trade disputes those</text>
  <text start="297.889" dur="7.861">vacancies have not been filled by the</text>
  <text start="302.419" dur="5.871">Trump administration remember Trump has</text>
  <text start="305.75" dur="5.31">criticized the World Trade Organization</text>
  <text start="308.29" dur="5.379">for allowing China to retain its special</text>
  <text start="311.06" dur="5.13">status as a developing nation though</text>
  <text start="313.669" dur="4.951">it&amp;#39;s number two in the world economy</text>
  <text start="316.19" dur="5.43">while looking the other way when it</text>
  <text start="318.62" dur="5.76">violates WTO rules the World Trade</text>
  <text start="321.62" dur="5.16">Organization is one of several globalist</text>
  <text start="324.38" dur="5.43">institutions established at the end of</text>
  <text start="326.78" dur="6.9">the second world war and this is the</text>
  <text start="329.81" dur="7.01">World Bank the IMF and a lot of the</text>
  <text start="333.68" dur="6.239">central banks around the world</text>
  <text start="336.82" dur="5.67">Trump has threatened to cut off US</text>
  <text start="339.919" dur="5.941">funding for the World Trade Organization</text>
  <text start="342.49" dur="6.94">do you really think that Trump wants to</text>
  <text start="345.86" dur="6.869">have these globalist entities in place</text>
  <text start="349.43" dur="7.32">when we transition into a new economic</text>
  <text start="352.729" dur="6.391">system no he does not this is why</text>
  <text start="356.75" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re pushing as hard as they possibly</text>
  <text start="359.12" dur="4.5">can</text>
  <text start="360.08" dur="7.38">to reverse everything that was done over</text>
  <text start="363.62" dur="7.32">the many many years and once again time</text>
  <text start="367.46" dur="6.9">is very important because Trump and the</text>
  <text start="370.94" dur="6.63">Patriots they can&amp;#39;t do this all at once</text>
  <text start="374.36" dur="6.179">they don&amp;#39;t have the time remember we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="377.57" dur="7.11">at the end stages of a central bank</text>
  <text start="380.539" dur="6.991">system yes I know Trump is using all the</text>
  <text start="384.68" dur="4.98">tools the central banks have used over</text>
  <text start="387.53" dur="6.09">the many many years he&amp;#39;s using them</text>
  <text start="389.66" dur="8.55">against themselves to pump this system</text>
  <text start="393.62" dur="6.979">up but that drug only lasts a certain</text>
  <text start="398.21" dur="4.95">period of time and then eventually</text>
  <text start="400.599" dur="4.931">things start to start to break down look</text>
  <text start="403.16" dur="4.25">at Europe right now everything is</text>
  <text start="405.53" dur="5.1">starting to break down in Europe</text>
  <text start="407.41" dur="4.72">actually Trump tweeted out that the rest</text>
  <text start="410.63" dur="3.81">of the world is falling apart but the</text>
  <text start="412.13" dur="4.409">United States is doing well Trump the</text>
  <text start="414.44" dur="5.55">Patriots they know that the rest of the</text>
  <text start="416.539" dur="7.471">world can&amp;#39;t continue on and this is why</text>
  <text start="419.99" dur="5.669">they&amp;#39;re moving at a very rapid pace some</text>
  <text start="424.01" dur="2.43">people don&amp;#39;t believe it&amp;#39;s a rapid pace</text>
  <text start="425.659" dur="3.751">but</text>
  <text start="426.44" dur="5.04">you have to remember what the central</text>
  <text start="429.41" dur="6.15">bank what the globalists have done over</text>
  <text start="431.48" dur="6.96">the many years and we can see that at</text>
  <text start="435.56" dur="5.4">each phase Trump of the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="438.44" dur="4.65">breaking down the globalists system</text>
  <text start="440.96" dur="5.94">dismantling it right in front of her</text>
  <text start="443.09" dur="7.11">eyes just like it was built up during</text>
  <text start="446.9" dur="5.4">this entire many many years nobody</text>
  <text start="450.2" dur="4.95">really noticed because it was done very</text>
  <text start="452.3" dur="5.1">very slowly Trump now is just reversing</text>
  <text start="455.15" dur="4.2">everything that they did now of course</text>
  <text start="457.4" dur="4.8">the central banks the deep state they</text>
  <text start="459.35" dur="5.27">all know what he&amp;#39;s doing they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="462.2" dur="6.15">to figure out a way on how to stop him</text>
  <text start="464.62" dur="8.95">every plan that they tried to shut down</text>
  <text start="468.35" dur="7.98">the economic system is not working Trump</text>
  <text start="473.57" dur="5.85">right now and those people behind him he</text>
  <text start="476.33" dur="6.06">has complete and utter control of the</text>
  <text start="479.42" dur="7.11">economy and since he has control over</text>
  <text start="482.39" dur="6.96">the US economy the US economy is shining</text>
  <text start="486.53" dur="6.87">bright while the rest of the world is</text>
  <text start="489.35" dur="5.819">not now if the central banks decide to</text>
  <text start="493.4" dur="5.34">do something and bring down the system</text>
  <text start="495.169" dur="8.461">it&amp;#39;s going to bring down the rest of the</text>
  <text start="498.74" dur="10.05">world first and this they cannot blame</text>
  <text start="503.63" dur="8.67">on Trump because Europe falls apart but</text>
  <text start="508.79" dur="5.4">the United States looks fantastic what</text>
  <text start="512.3" dur="4.89">are they gonna say it was Trump&amp;#39;s fault</text>
  <text start="514.19" dur="5.55">very hard to do yes they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="517.19" dur="5.19">say that tariffs are causing this but we</text>
  <text start="519.74" dur="6.33">know from the New York Fed that tariffs</text>
  <text start="522.38" dur="7.47">have no effect on this remember the</text>
  <text start="526.07" dur="7.65">central bank system is falling apart by</text>
  <text start="529.85" dur="7.11">default it was never meant to go this</text>
  <text start="533.72" dur="5.58">long this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing a decline</text>
  <text start="536.96" dur="4.62">this is why every time they make a</text>
  <text start="539.3" dur="3.81">prediction of what GDP numbers are gonna</text>
  <text start="541.58" dur="4.02">be like what the economy&amp;#39;s gonna be like</text>
  <text start="543.11" dur="4.83">it always turns out to be very low and</text>
  <text start="545.6" dur="3.93">if you go back in time and you look at</text>
  <text start="547.94" dur="5.25">their predictions and you look at the</text>
  <text start="549.53" dur="6.71">facts you can see that the entire global</text>
  <text start="553.19" dur="5.34">system is declining very very rapidly</text>
  <text start="556.24" dur="3.8">Trump in the Patriots they are</text>
  <text start="558.53" dur="3.85">continually dismantled</text>
  <text start="560.04" dur="5.76">everything the globalists have put</text>
  <text start="562.38" dur="5.67">together and now we can see they are</text>
  <text start="565.8" dur="4.62">getting very very worried this is why</text>
  <text start="568.05" dur="5.73">Kissinger the IMF and the rest are out</text>
  <text start="570.42" dur="6.69">there telling us that Trump needs to</text>
  <text start="573.78" dur="5.88">make a trade deal with China Trump</text>
  <text start="577.11" dur="4.65">doesn&amp;#39;t have to do anything the only</text>
  <text start="579.66" dur="5.04">reason they&amp;#39;re forcing this is because</text>
  <text start="581.76" dur="5.76">they know that their system that they</text>
  <text start="584.7" dur="6.96">worked so hard to create it will</text>
  <text start="587.52" dur="7.14">completely implode if Trump does not</text>
  <text start="591.66" dur="5.97">make that trade deal now Trump once</text>
  <text start="594.66" dur="5.64">again can use this against them because</text>
  <text start="597.63" dur="5.85">remember their narrative is that Trump</text>
  <text start="600.3" dur="5.96">is causing all this with tariffs because</text>
  <text start="603.48" dur="5.97">of the trade war if he makes the deal</text>
  <text start="606.26" dur="4.6">gets rid of the tariffs and the economic</text>
  <text start="609.45" dur="4.95">system still implode</text>
  <text start="610.86" dur="6.51">they can&amp;#39;t blame it on him he knows this</text>
  <text start="614.4" dur="4.68">if he doesn&amp;#39;t make the trade deal and he</text>
  <text start="617.37" dur="3.81">allows everything to move the way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="619.08" dur="4.65">moving we already know from</text>
  <text start="621.18" dur="4.95">documentation that tariffs have nothing</text>
  <text start="623.73" dur="5.58">to do with this because as you delve</text>
  <text start="626.13" dur="6.48">deep into why this is happening it has</text>
  <text start="629.31" dur="5.49">nothing to do with tariffs it has to do</text>
  <text start="632.61" dur="5.55">with the way their system is designed</text>
  <text start="634.8" dur="7.5">this is why the World Bank is now</text>
  <text start="638.16" dur="8.7">loaning China funds and this is why</text>
  <text start="642.3" dur="5.7">Trump is going after each piece he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="646.86" dur="5.37">going after the World Trade Organization</text>
  <text start="648" dur="6.69">a very unfair Organization this is why</text>
  <text start="652.23" dur="5.13">he doesn&amp;#39;t want to fund it anymore this</text>
  <text start="654.69" dur="5.33">is why they&amp;#39;re taking each piece and</text>
  <text start="657.36" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re putting pressure on it and</text>
  <text start="660.02" dur="6.24">eventually each piece will be removed</text>
  <text start="663.51" dur="5.46">and we see it happening in real time</text>
  <text start="666.26" dur="4.75">listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
  <text start="668.97" dur="5.57">listening be well be safe and especially</text>
