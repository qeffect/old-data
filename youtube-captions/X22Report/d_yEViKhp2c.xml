  <text start="109.27" dur="7.64">many indicators that are coming true</text>
  <text start="113.369" dur="7.931">where we reported on them a month ago</text>
  <text start="116.91" dur="6.4">four months ago a year ago and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="121.3" dur="4.159">starting to see some of this actually</text>
  <text start="123.31" dur="4.74">what we&amp;#39;re seeing in the auto industry</text>
  <text start="125.459" dur="5.05">things are rapidly deteriorating very</text>
  <text start="128.05" dur="4.59">very quickly we talked about channel</text>
  <text start="130.509" dur="5.671">stuffing in the past we talked about how</text>
  <text start="132.64" dur="6.75">the auto industry calculates sales as</text>
  <text start="136.18" dur="5.4">they give as they push cars into the</text>
  <text start="139.39" dur="5.04">dealerships those are counted as sales</text>
  <text start="141.58" dur="6.96">and we know that Ford right now well</text>
  <text start="144.43" dur="6.389">they idled for plants and we see GM and</text>
  <text start="148.54" dur="4.529">Fiat Chrysler they announced today that</text>
  <text start="150.819" dur="5.191">they will idle seven plants across</text>
  <text start="153.069" dur="6.481">Canada and the US as they reduce to work</text>
  <text start="156.01" dur="7.41">near record inventories amid weakening</text>
  <text start="159.55" dur="7.47">sales and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="163.42" dur="6.51">that inventories the sales ratio above</text>
  <text start="167.02" dur="5.49">their above historical peaks this is</text>
  <text start="169.93" dur="6.389">only beaten by the huge spike in 2008</text>
  <text start="172.51" dur="6.179">when sales completely stopped well the</text>
  <text start="176.319" dur="5">pain for automakers it has just begun</text>
  <text start="178.689" dur="5.39">and it is going to get worse</text>
  <text start="181.319" dur="4.711">we see GM&amp;#39;s inventory vehicles on dealer</text>
  <text start="184.079" dur="3.39">lots at the end of november stood at</text>
  <text start="186.03" dur="3.39">eight hundred and seventy four thousand</text>
  <text start="187.469" dur="5.25">up twenty six point five percent from</text>
  <text start="189.42" dur="7.53">the same time a year ago and right now</text>
  <text start="192.719" dur="7.8">factories they will close anywhere from</text>
  <text start="196.95" dur="7.289">one to three weeks and this will put</text>
  <text start="200.519" dur="6.9">about 10,000 workers out of work right</text>
  <text start="204.239" dur="5.191">now they&amp;#39;ll be idled right now and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="207.419" dur="4.44">have to see and watch how the auto</text>
  <text start="209.43" dur="5.91">industry does now we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="211.859" dur="6.391">about retail sales and in past reports</text>
  <text start="215.34" dur="4.799">we talked about how they use estimated</text>
  <text start="218.25" dur="2.76">retail sales because if they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="220.139" dur="3.24">the numbers or if they don&amp;#39;t like the</text>
  <text start="221.01" dur="4.229">way the numbers look they estimate what</text>
  <text start="223.379" dur="3.33">the sales are going to be and if a store</text>
  <text start="225.239" dur="3.511">goes bankrupt when they go out of</text>
  <text start="226.709" dur="4.2">business they don&amp;#39;t just drop the retail</text>
  <text start="228.75" dur="4.59">sales they spread it over many many</text>
  <text start="230.909" dur="4.86">months up to a year where they can phase</text>
  <text start="233.34" dur="4.41">it out so it looks better on paper and</text>
  <text start="235.769" dur="3.661">right now the census bureau reported</text>
  <text start="237.75" dur="3.81">that it&amp;#39;s advance estimates of retail</text>
  <text start="239.43" dur="3.75">sales for November well they show a</text>
  <text start="241.56" dur="4.919">point one percent gain which we</text>
  <text start="243.18" dur="6.119">mentioned before and this is a point one</text>
  <text start="246.479" dur="4.801">percent gain from October and a three</text>
  <text start="249.299" dur="5.18">point eight percent gain over November</text>
  <text start="251.28" dur="8.069">of 2015 now Wall Street forecast was</text>
  <text start="254.479" dur="9.041">about 0.4% game and that&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="259.349" dur="6.241">problem the problem is is that the</text>
  <text start="263.52" dur="3.75">headline report of a point one percent</text>
  <text start="265.59" dur="5.88">increase in retail sales for November</text>
  <text start="267.27" dur="7.769">it&amp;#39;s based on estimates by the Census</text>
  <text start="271.47" dur="6.66">Bureau for the largest retail sales</text>
  <text start="275.039" dur="4.651">categories if you go through the data</text>
  <text start="278.13" dur="3.659">tables that accompany the headline</text>
  <text start="279.69" dur="5.069">retail sales report you can see</text>
  <text start="281.789" dur="4.5">asterisks in the not adjusted data for</text>
  <text start="284.759" dur="4.59">November in most of the business</text>
  <text start="286.289" dur="6.801">categories and we can see that these are</text>
  <text start="289.349" dur="8.19">advance estimates and they don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="293.09" dur="6.91">have the sales or the numbers were much</text>
  <text start="297.539" dur="5.19">lower than that what what they expected</text>
  <text start="300" dur="6.24">so they brought them up they do this</text>
  <text start="302.729" dur="5.43">quite a bit now on an inflation adjusted</text>
  <text start="306.24" dur="3.989">basis the point one percent gain</text>
  <text start="308.159" dur="4.591">reported for November is actually a</text>
  <text start="310.229" dur="4.41">decline and that point eight percent</text>
  <text start="312.75" dur="4.009">gain reported for October</text>
  <text start="314.639" dur="5.4">actually that was revised down</text>
  <text start="316.759" dur="5.5">two-point-six percent gain and it is</text>
  <text start="320.039" dur="4.68">highly probable that November&amp;#39;s numbers</text>
  <text start="322.259" dur="4.59">guess what they&amp;#39;ll probably revised to</text>
  <text start="324.719" dur="7.591">negative when December&amp;#39;s retail sales</text>
  <text start="326.849" dur="7.801">report hits in January now we understand</text>
  <text start="332.31" dur="6.06">that they&amp;#39;re going to manipulate these</text>
  <text start="334.65" dur="6.78">numbers and what we&amp;#39;ll be looking at is</text>
  <text start="338.37" dur="5.069">the numbers from the stores themselves</text>
  <text start="341.43" dur="4.62">because it&amp;#39;s much harder to manipulate</text>
  <text start="343.439" dur="4.741">those numbers now according to a</text>
  <text start="346.05" dur="4.739">research piece published by cohen and</text>
  <text start="348.18" dur="5.4">company on december 14th they are saying</text>
  <text start="350.789" dur="4.5">that mall traffic fell by six point four</text>
  <text start="353.58" dur="3.959">percent in november from october and</text>
  <text start="355.289" dur="5.13">december month to date traffic was down</text>
  <text start="357.539" dur="6.93">by nine point nine percent even with the</text>
  <text start="360.419" dur="7.321">growth in online retail sales ecommerce</text>
  <text start="364.469" dur="9.87">accounts for less than ten percent of</text>
  <text start="367.74" dur="9.63">total retail sales and the census bureau</text>
  <text start="374.339" dur="5.13">estimated ecommerce represented about</text>
  <text start="377.37" dur="8.009">seven point seven percent of total sales</text>
  <text start="379.469" dur="8.611">in the third quarter of 2016 now we know</text>
  <text start="385.379" dur="4.741">that everyone is out there and the</text>
  <text start="388.08" dur="4.019">corporate media is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="390.12" dur="3.81">saying well the reason why traffic is</text>
  <text start="392.099" dur="3.99">slowing in the in the brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="393.93" dur="3.57">stores is because everyone has moved to</text>
  <text start="396.089" dur="3.871">online sales and those are really</text>
  <text start="397.5" dur="5.339">picking up actually they&amp;#39;re really not</text>
  <text start="399.96" dur="5.759">yes people are moving from brick and</text>
  <text start="402.839" dur="5.911">mortar and going to online but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="405.719" dur="5.73">like we have an additional inflow of</text>
  <text start="408.75" dur="5.039">people ordering online spending a lot</text>
  <text start="411.449" dur="3.69">more money we just have the same people</text>
  <text start="413.789" dur="3.53">that were shopping in the</text>
  <text start="415.139" dur="6.861">brick-and-mortar stores shopping online</text>
  <text start="417.319" dur="10.47">but online sales hasn&amp;#39;t really increased</text>
  <text start="422" dur="8.379">that much because the overall sales</text>
  <text start="427.789" dur="5.291">they&amp;#39;re down and that is including</text>
  <text start="430.379" dur="6.871">online and brick-and-mortar and again</text>
  <text start="433.08" dur="8.399">these are guesstimates so we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="437.25" dur="6.81">trouble here the economy does not look</text>
  <text start="441.479" dur="4.65">good whatsoever and as we come out of</text>
  <text start="444.06" dur="4.53">this holiday season we can see already</text>
  <text start="446.129" dur="3.661">that this is going to be at the</text>
  <text start="448.59" dur="2.82">disaster now of course the corporate</text>
  <text start="449.79" dur="2.88">media the US government they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="451.41" dur="3.84">try to spin this as much as they</text>
  <text start="452.67" dur="4.77">possibly can they do this all the time</text>
  <text start="455.25" dur="4.41">to make you think this holiday season is</text>
  <text start="457.44" dur="3.78">doing really really well they&amp;#39;ll throw</text>
  <text start="459.66" dur="3.6">out numbers like Oh online sales are</text>
  <text start="461.22" dur="4.23">doing 3 billion in sales which are</text>
  <text start="463.26" dur="4.65">meaningless because if brick-and-mortar</text>
  <text start="465.45" dur="6.36">lost three billion and online game 3</text>
  <text start="467.91" dur="5.88">billion what happened here nothing they</text>
  <text start="471.81" dur="3.69">need the overall sales of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="473.79" dur="4.53">happening in brick-and-mortar and online</text>
  <text start="475.5" dur="4.95">and of course they&amp;#39;re not going to hand</text>
  <text start="478.32" dur="3.48">that out because it would show that</text>
  <text start="480.45" dur="5.82">things are much worse than they really</text>
  <text start="481.8" dur="8.42">are we see caterpillar well they have</text>
  <text start="486.27" dur="8.16">post a record 48 consecutive months of</text>
  <text start="490.22" dur="6.85">declining retail sales the company has</text>
  <text start="494.43" dur="6.42">not reported a single monthly uptick in</text>
  <text start="497.07" dur="8.21">sales for 48 consecutive months that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="500.85" dur="9.9">four straight years now this period is</text>
  <text start="505.28" dur="9.88">2.5 times longer then during the great</text>
  <text start="510.75" dur="8.03">recession which was 19 months so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="515.16" dur="6.84">in this incredible recovery and</text>
  <text start="518.78" dur="7.27">caterpillar is showing a declining</text>
  <text start="522" dur="6.99">retail sales of 48 months during the</text>
  <text start="526.05" dur="7.88">recession the Great Recession it was a</text>
  <text start="528.99" dur="8.36">19-month drop is this really recovery I</text>
  <text start="533.93" dur="6.49">don&amp;#39;t think so it&amp;#39;s more like a disaster</text>
  <text start="537.35" dur="7.33">but what&amp;#39;s more interesting about this</text>
  <text start="540.42" dur="7.23">is that the stock continually moves</text>
  <text start="544.68" dur="5.37">higher and higher so we have a</text>
  <text start="547.65" dur="6.15">disconnect here or the stock market&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="550.05" dur="7.95">manipulated now when we look at the</text>
  <text start="553.8" dur="6.81">economy we wonder all these economists</text>
  <text start="558" dur="4.92">these PhDs that the corporate media has</text>
  <text start="560.61" dur="4.65">on they keep telling us how great</text>
  <text start="562.92" dur="4.86">everything is so let&amp;#39;s take a look and</text>
  <text start="565.26" dur="5.78">let&amp;#39;s see how they&amp;#39;re doing here with</text>
  <text start="567.78" dur="5.52">the economy they talk about inflation</text>
  <text start="571.04" dur="4.21">conventional experts believe inflation</text>
  <text start="573.3" dur="5.73">has been near zero for the past decade</text>
  <text start="575.25" dur="7.05">and will continue to be near zero pretty</text>
  <text start="579.03" dur="6.66">much forever did they get it right</text>
  <text start="582.3" dur="6.36">well people who are exposed to</text>
  <text start="585.69" dur="5.73">healthcare guess what they saw premiums</text>
  <text start="588.66" dur="6.45">skyrocket people who are exposed to</text>
  <text start="591.42" dur="7.61">going to college guess what tuition</text>
  <text start="595.11" dur="7.92">skyrocketed rental expenses have gone up</text>
  <text start="599.03" dur="8.2">housing has gone up so are we seeing</text>
  <text start="603.03" dur="8.58">inflation yeah on these real big ticket</text>
  <text start="607.23" dur="7.8">items we are seeing inflation over the</text>
  <text start="611.61" dur="9.51">past we&amp;#39;ve seen inflation on food fresh</text>
  <text start="615.03" dur="10.17">food so pretty much they&amp;#39;re not correct</text>
  <text start="621.12" dur="7.35">because those individuals who are paying</text>
  <text start="625.2" dur="9.9">for all of this guess what it&amp;#39;s eating</text>
  <text start="628.47" dur="9.69">into their wallet or pocket book so so</text>
  <text start="635.1" dur="6.54">far they haven&amp;#39;t been right about</text>
  <text start="638.16" dur="6.63">inflation productivity the experts admit</text>
  <text start="641.64" dur="7.5">they are confused by the steep decline</text>
  <text start="644.79" dur="6.2">in productivity and they&amp;#39;re saying well</text>
  <text start="649.14" dur="4.53">don&amp;#39;t worry this is going to turn around</text>
  <text start="650.99" dur="5.98">once we get higher wages and profits</text>
  <text start="653.67" dur="7.32">start returning but we don&amp;#39;t see this</text>
  <text start="656.97" dur="8.88">happening productivity is declining we</text>
  <text start="660.99" dur="9.96">see higher wages declining we are seeing</text>
  <text start="665.85" dur="8.19">profits to climb it&amp;#39;s not working wrong</text>
  <text start="670.95" dur="9.08">again they said zero interest rate</text>
  <text start="674.04" dur="9.3">policy zerp the Federal Reserve the EU</text>
  <text start="680.03" dur="6.73">said that near zero interest rates with</text>
  <text start="683.34" dur="6.86">a fix-all solution to low growth in GDP</text>
  <text start="686.76" dur="7.8">employment wages and business investment</text>
  <text start="690.2" dur="10.48">well as this really worked out what has</text>
  <text start="694.56" dur="10.8">derp actually fixed nothing what has</text>
  <text start="700.68" dur="5.88">destroyed savers pensions the hundreds</text>
  <text start="705.36" dur="3.92">of billions of dollars in interest</text>
  <text start="706.56" dur="7.7">income that once flowed to savers</text>
  <text start="709.28" dur="6.76">pension funds and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="714.26" dur="3.31">serp is</text>
  <text start="716.04" dur="4.95">drawing more than it is helping the</text>
  <text start="717.57" dur="7.319">people derp is helping the central</text>
  <text start="720.99" dur="7.17">bank&amp;#39;s zerp is helping keep keeping the</text>
  <text start="724.889" dur="9.021">economy propped up for their benefit but</text>
  <text start="728.16" dur="10.38">it&amp;#39;s not helping the people employment</text>
  <text start="733.91" dur="9.359">we know that the corporate media the US</text>
  <text start="738.54" dur="9.299">government they use statistical trickery</text>
  <text start="743.269" dur="7.62">but they can&amp;#39;t disguise one thing the</text>
  <text start="747.839" dur="6.87">civilian labor force participation rate</text>
  <text start="750.889" dur="5.95">because that continually declines they</text>
  <text start="754.709" dur="4.8">all they do is continually throw people</text>
  <text start="756.839" dur="5.761">off of it and say they&amp;#39;re not just</text>
  <text start="759.509" dur="7.291">looking so hey we&amp;#39;re not going to count</text>
  <text start="762.6" dur="7.14">them but it shows us that it is not</text>
  <text start="766.8" dur="4.979">working whatsoever and this is proof</text>
  <text start="769.74" dur="3.779">that whatever they&amp;#39;re saying about</text>
  <text start="771.779" dur="7.56">employment being at four point six</text>

  <text start="784.199" dur="5.031">much a lie and they spin everything to</text>
  <text start="787.26" dur="5.509">make it seem like everything is working</text>
  <text start="789.23" dur="7.51">now something very interesting with</text>
  <text start="792.769" dur="7.06">unemployment claims in hard times when</text>
  <text start="796.74" dur="6.209">layoffs are widespread and new jobs are</text>
  <text start="799.829" dur="5.49">scarce this number spikes in better</text>
  <text start="802.949" dur="4.231">times when jobs are plentiful and</text>

  <text start="810.72" dur="5.059">falls past a certain point way to start</text>
  <text start="813.54" dur="4.83">rising at a rate that leads through</text>
  <text start="815.779" dur="5.56">market forces or Federal Reserve action</text>
  <text start="818.37" dur="4.949">to rising inflation and higher interest</text>
  <text start="821.339" dur="5.821">rates which are destabilizing and</text>
  <text start="823.319" dur="6.96">generally cause a recession and when we</text>

  <text start="832.38" dur="4.86">time and we look at to that if we go</text>
