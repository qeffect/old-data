  <text start="717.23" dur="4.11">remember back in March 2018 when</text>
  <text start="719.45" dur="4.47">President Trump signed the omnibus</text>

  <text start="729.77" dur="4.59">without realizing that spending bills</text>
  <text start="731.87" dur="4.8">are discretionary which means Trump is</text>
  <text start="734.36" dur="4.38">basically free to ignore the projects</text>
  <text start="736.67" dur="4.47">listed in the bill and use as much of</text>

  <text start="924.88" dur="3.6">fact checkers are controlled by the</text>

  <text start="928.48" dur="4.83">looking at their new stories and saying</text>

  <text start="933.31" dur="5.13">if you go beyond that you can see that</text>
  <text start="935.05" dur="6.18">no these things are true so now what</text>
  <text start="938.44" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re doing or Facebook is doing and</text>
  <text start="941.23" dur="4.229">probably Google and YouTube and the rest</text>
  <text start="942.82" dur="5.639">they&amp;#39;re going to be fact-checking photos</text>
  <text start="945.459" dur="5.19">and videos Facebook announced that the</text>

  <text start="979.54" dur="4.87">going to go to a real person to say if</text>
  <text start="982.93" dur="3.61">this is real or not</text>
  <text start="984.41" dur="3.96">now Facebook is going to cataract</text>

  <text start="1000.22" dur="5.22">further reduce with the expansion of</text>
  <text start="1002.59" dur="6.39">photo and video fact-checking so how</text>
  <text start="1005.44" dur="5.58">does it work similar to our work for</text>
  <text start="1008.98" dur="3.84">articles we have built a machine</text>
  <text start="1011.02" dur="3.69">learning model that uses various</text>

  <text start="1014.71" dur="4.59">from people on Facebook to identify</text>
  <text start="1016.75" dur="4.38">potentially false content we then send</text>
  <text start="1019.3" dur="4.14">those photos and videos to fact checkers</text>

  <text start="1025.15" dur="4.59">many of our third-party fact-checking</text>

  <text start="1042.16" dur="5.13">these fact checkers now you&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="1044.439" dur="7.291">wondering why am i bringing this up go</text>
  <text start="1047.29" dur="8.67">back to cues posts where they said they</text>
  <text start="1051.73" dur="7.08">have live video live streaming video of</text>
  <text start="1055.96" dur="5.82">Obama there if you go further back in</text>
  <text start="1058.81" dur="8.87">cues posts they have pictures of Obama</text>
  <text start="1061.78" dur="9.15">in Kenya garb holding an ak-47 and also</text>

  <text start="1078.94" dur="7.11">Clinton on the tarmac speaking to Lynch</text>
  <text start="1083.98" dur="5.09">and we can see that they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1086.05" dur="7.35">ready and prepared to counter all this</text>
  <text start="1089.07" dur="6.22">they&amp;#39;re going to try to debunk what the</text>
  <text start="1093.4" dur="3.63">government is going to put out now</text>
  <text start="1095.29" dur="3.18">before you say well that doesn&amp;#39;t sound</text>
  <text start="1097.03" dur="3.68">like they&amp;#39;re going to do this we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1098.47" dur="5.91">already seeing in the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="1100.71" dur="7.93">headlines like this the US government is</text>
  <text start="1104.38" dur="5.85">no stranger to fake news it used to</text>
  <text start="1108.64" dur="5.25">publish it this was coming from Business</text>
  <text start="1110.23" dur="8.01">Insider and they&amp;#39;re going back in time</text>
  <text start="1113.89" dur="6.75">in the early 1900s the US government</text>
  <text start="1118.24" dur="4.98">forced documents that fueled the</text>
  <text start="1120.64" dur="4.74">mounting Red Scare now of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1123.22" dur="9.15">not gonna bring up the fake news about</text>
  <text start="1125.38" dur="9.299">Syria about 9/11 about Iraq about</text>
  <text start="1132.37" dur="4.2">Afghanistan they&amp;#39;re gonna go back</text>
  <text start="1134.679" dur="3.75">further in time because you know they</text>
  <text start="1136.57" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t want to show that there was fake</text>
  <text start="1138.429" dur="4.591">news there but the whole point of this</text>
  <text start="1140.32" dur="5.04">is they&amp;#39;re trying to make the case that</text>
  <text start="1143.02" dur="4.89">the government has used fake news before</text>
  <text start="1145.36" dur="4.86">and the article goes on to say that in</text>
  <text start="1147.91" dur="3.75">the early 1900&amp;#39;s the US government</text>
  <text start="1150.22" dur="3.48">published false documents that fueled</text>
  <text start="1151.66" dur="3.87">the mounting Red Scare unbeknownst to</text>
  <text start="1153.7" dur="3.87">the government that documents were</text>
  <text start="1155.53" dur="3.81">forgeries the publication of documents</text>
  <text start="1157.57" dur="4.17">was a case of the government accepting</text>
  <text start="1159.34" dur="5.61">false information because it helped</text>
  <text start="1161.74" dur="5.069">justify its actions so basically what</text>
  <text start="1164.95" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re saying is that the government</text>
  <text start="1166.809" dur="5.971">received documentation they went with it</text>
  <text start="1169.9" dur="4.98">and they didn&amp;#39;t know it was fake well</text>
  <text start="1172.78" dur="4.59">what&amp;#39;s going to happen we have the</text>
  <text start="1174.88" dur="4.14">investigators investigating they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1177.37" dur="3.63">putting together all this information</text>
  <text start="1179.02" dur="4.95">there are pictures there are videos</text>
  <text start="1181" dur="4.47">there&amp;#39;s actual documentation and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1183.97" dur="4.83">building the narrative they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1185.47" dur="6.209">counter it by saying this stuff could be</text>
  <text start="1188.8" dur="3.36">fake because look what happened in the</text>
  <text start="1191.679" dur="3.121">past</text>
  <text start="1192.16" dur="4.56">now Facebook and probably Google in</text>
  <text start="1194.8" dur="3.87">YouTube they&amp;#39;re going to most likely try</text>
  <text start="1196.72" dur="4.709">to debunk these pictures were from apart</text>
  <text start="1198.67" dur="4.95">so it they don&amp;#39;t have to do it fully all</text>
  <text start="1201.429" dur="4.441">they have to do is question it to make</text>
  <text start="1203.62" dur="4.74">people say well is it fake maybe it is</text>
  <text start="1205.87" dur="6.24">and that&amp;#39;s how they&amp;#39;re trying to counter</text>
  <text start="1208.36" dur="6.87">all of this but I&amp;#39;m sure cue and those</text>
  <text start="1212.11" dur="5.64">preparing all this have the originals</text>
  <text start="1215.23" dur="4.44">where they can&amp;#39;t be debunked and they</text>
  <text start="1217.75" dur="5.52">can show that no this was the original</text>
  <text start="1219.67" dur="7.38">this is the original video this is the</text>
  <text start="1223.27" dur="5.97">original picture and debunk what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1227.05" dur="3.6">trying to do but we can see that the</text>
  <text start="1229.24" dur="3.3">deep state they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="1230.65" dur="3.69">counter everything that&amp;#39;s going to come</text>
  <text start="1232.54" dur="3.6">out and I believe this is going to be</text>
  <text start="1234.34" dur="3.3">phase one and then we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="1236.14" dur="2.88">moving into Phase two as more and more</text>
  <text start="1237.64" dur="3.18">information comes out and then</text>
  <text start="1239.02" dur="3.27">eventually have the event of all events</text>
  <text start="1240.82" dur="3.72">because they&amp;#39;re gonna totally lose</text>
  <text start="1242.29" dur="6.18">control because truth will always win</text>
  <text start="1244.54" dur="6.18">you can&amp;#39;t knock the truth you can try</text>
  <text start="1248.47" dur="3.54">with propaganda but propaganda has</text>
  <text start="1250.72" dur="4.41">nothing to back it</text>
  <text start="1252.01" dur="6">that&amp;#39;s the problem here just like all</text>
  <text start="1255.13" dur="6.42">these fact-checking sites they they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1258.01" dur="6.42">losing the war here because they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1269.05" dur="4.2">that&amp;#39;s why Facebook you don&amp;#39;t really see</text>
  <text start="1271.03" dur="3.78">it that much anymore they stopped doing</text>
  <text start="1273.25" dur="3">it because people weren&amp;#39;t paying</text>
  <text start="1274.81" dur="3.21">attention so what do they end up doing</text>
  <text start="1276.25" dur="4.26">they started to ban those sites that</text>
  <text start="1278.02" dur="6.57">were pushing out the truth they started</text>
  <text start="1280.51" dur="7.38">to shadow ban they censored this is how</text>
  <text start="1284.59" dur="5.31">they try to control the narrative but</text>
  <text start="1287.89" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re not going to win we see the</text>

  <text start="1295.63" dur="3.5">see that a lot of these leaders in all</text>
  <text start="1297.55" dur="4.71">these Middle Eastern countries after</text>
  <text start="1299.13" dur="5.29">regime change these leaders popped up</text>
  <text start="1302.26" dur="4.41">and of course they were approved by the</text>
  <text start="1304.42" dur="3.48">deep state and of course we know the</text>
  <text start="1306.67" dur="3.6">elections were fixed to get these</text>
  <text start="1307.9" dur="4.05">individuals into office this way the</text>
  <text start="1310.27" dur="3.42">deeps they can control them these</text>
  <text start="1311.95" dur="3.66">individuals are seeing the writing on</text>
  <text start="1313.69" dur="4.38">the wall and they&amp;#39;re realizing it is</text>
  <text start="1315.61" dur="4.83">time to get out and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="1318.07" dur="6.33">we&amp;#39;re seeing we see Trump right now he</text>
  <text start="1320.44" dur="7.41">has slammed John Kerry and we know that</text>
  <text start="1324.4" dur="6.03">John Kerry went over to Iran trying to</text>
  <text start="1327.85" dur="4.77">convince the Iranians to keep the</text>
  <text start="1330.43" dur="4.53">nuclear deal and basically John Kerry</text>
  <text start="1332.62" dur="4.2">said listen just wait it out Trump will</text>
  <text start="1334.96" dur="4.74">no longer be in office and we can</text>
  <text start="1336.82" dur="4.59">continue with our operations now do you</text>
  <text start="1339.7" dur="3.53">really think Kerry is over there because</text>
  <text start="1341.41" dur="5.13">he&amp;#39;s very concerned about the Iranians</text>
  <text start="1343.23" dur="5.26">developing a nuclear weapon or is he</text>
  <text start="1346.54" dur="4.05">over there trying to protect all of</text>
  <text start="1348.49" dur="4.77">those that have done things illegally</text>
  <text start="1350.59" dur="5.88">where they had payoffs and other things</text>
  <text start="1353.26" dur="5.91">trying to protect and stop what is about</text>
  <text start="1356.47" dur="5.24">to happen but Trump came out and he</text>
  <text start="1359.17" dur="5.73">tweeted John Kerry had illegal meetings</text>
  <text start="1361.71" dur="6.7">known as the word illegal because he</text>
  <text start="1364.9" dur="5.79">broke the Logan act of 1799 illegal</text>
  <text start="1368.41" dur="5.85">meetings with the very hostile Iranian</text>
  <text start="1370.69" dur="5.82">regime which can only serve to undercut</text>
  <text start="1374.26" dur="5.01">our great work to the detriment of the</text>
  <text start="1376.51" dur="4.92">American people he told them to wait out</text>
  <text start="1379.27" dur="5.07">the Trump administration was he a</text>
  <text start="1381.43" dur="4.23">registered under the foreign agents</text>
  <text start="1384.34" dur="4.08">Registration Act</text>
  <text start="1385.66" dur="5.13">bad very interesting that he mentioned</text>
  <text start="1388.42" dur="7.34">that because isn&amp;#39;t this why mana fort</text>
  <text start="1390.79" dur="8.37">was brought up on charges and Podesta</text>
  <text start="1395.76" dur="3.88">retro actively registered as a foreign</text>
  <text start="1399.16" dur="3.99">agent</text>
  <text start="1399.64" dur="7.2">so is Kerry as a citizen registered as a</text>
  <text start="1403.15" dur="5.49">foreign agent and also why did he</text>
  <text start="1406.84" dur="4.2">violate the Logan Act what was the</text>
  <text start="1408.64" dur="6.75">purpose of all of this we know what the</text>
  <text start="1411.04" dur="6.08">purpose is he&amp;#39;s trying to stop what is</text>
  <text start="1415.39" dur="4.02">happening here trying to cover</text>
  <text start="1417.12" dur="5.38">everything that they had done that was</text>
  <text start="1419.41" dur="4.74">illegal we see Syria right now is going</text>
  <text start="1422.5" dur="5.34">to be opening the border with Jordan it</text>
  <text start="1424.15" dur="5.52">was closed and during the war and we see</text>
  <text start="1427.84" dur="4.98">now it&amp;#39;s going to be open again and</text>
  <text start="1429.67" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re gonna start trade with Jordan we</text>
  <text start="1432.82" dur="7.14">see that the French Foreign Minister is</text>
  <text start="1435.28" dur="9.72">warning that if Russia and Syria go in</text>
  <text start="1439.96" dur="8.07">and bomb it lib it&amp;#39;s going to allow the</text>
  <text start="1445" dur="6.15">terrorists to scatter to many different</text>
  <text start="1448.03" dur="6.36">areas now think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="1451.15" dur="6.78">and let&amp;#39;s use some logic think about all</text>
  <text start="1454.39" dur="5.82">the other towns cities that were</text>
  <text start="1457.93" dur="4.83">liberated in Syria where the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1460.21" dur="4.83">state were there al nusra al Qaeda a lot</text>
  <text start="1462.76" dur="4.35">of these paid mercenaries just</text>
  <text start="1465.04" dur="3.84">surrendered some of them were even</text>
  <text start="1467.11" dur="3.93">picked up by the coalition forces and</text>
  <text start="1468.88" dur="5.31">transferred transferred someplace else</text>
  <text start="1471.04" dur="7.5">and many of them were destroyed killed</text>
  <text start="1474.19" dur="6.54">in battle and were they a risk because</text>
  <text start="1478.54" dur="3.78">think about it if you&amp;#39;re in this country</text>
  <text start="1480.73" dur="3.36">and the Syrian Russian forces are</text>
  <text start="1482.32" dur="5.97">surrounding you where are they fleeing</text>
  <text start="1484.09" dur="6.78">they are captured so what they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="1488.29" dur="6.66">worried about and they keep bringing</text>
  <text start="1490.87" dur="7.65">this up is that if Russia and Syria go</text>
  <text start="1494.95" dur="7.74">into this area there is no reason for</text>
  <text start="1498.52" dur="6.92">France Germany the United States the UK</text>
  <text start="1502.69" dur="5.52">for the coalition forces to be in Syria</text>
  <text start="1505.44" dur="4.39">they&amp;#39;re very worried about this not</text>
  <text start="1508.21" dur="4.77">about the paid mercenaries they know who</text>
  <text start="1509.83" dur="6.36">they are they&amp;#39;re worried about their</text>
  <text start="1512.98" dur="6.809">control over Syria and if Syria Falls</text>
  <text start="1516.19" dur="5.729">and they lose complete control which</text>
  <text start="1519.789" dur="3.901">they already have they think by holding</text>
  <text start="1521.919" dur="4.83">on to it Lib they might have a chance</text>
  <text start="1523.69" dur="4.979">later on to regain control of Syria it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1526.749" dur="4.41">not gonna happen because we can see</text>
  <text start="1528.669" dur="3.99">right now between Trump the United</text>
  <text start="1531.159" dur="4.171">States and I&amp;#39;m not talking about the</text>
  <text start="1532.659" dur="5.431">deep state and Russia going back and</text>
  <text start="1535.33" dur="4.289">forth saying you know you better not do</text>
  <text start="1538.09" dur="3.569">this it&amp;#39;s a humanitarian crisis or</text>
  <text start="1539.619" dur="5.61">romance from North Korea they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1541.659" dur="6.51">prepared and ready to go in and liberate</text>
  <text start="1545.229" dur="5.88">this whole entire area and this is why</text>
  <text start="1548.169" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s all building up to this point this</text>
  <text start="1551.109" dur="5.341">is why the deep state is very worried</text>
  <text start="1553.479" dur="5.91">that they&amp;#39;re going to go into it Lib and</text>
  <text start="1556.45" dur="6.029">liberate the entire area because once</text>
  <text start="1559.389" dur="5.1">this is done it is game over</text>
  <text start="1562.479" dur="4.351">think about what the Syrian forces the</text>
  <text start="1564.489" dur="4.89">Russian forces have done they have</text>
  <text start="1566.83" dur="4.709">captured and liberated most of the</text>
  <text start="1569.379" dur="4.26">country and the people there with</text>
  <text start="1571.539" dur="4.291">reporters on the ground now are speaking</text>
  <text start="1573.639" dur="4.71">out saying it was horrible under the</text>
  <text start="1575.83" dur="4.199">paid mercenaries we were tortured we</text>
  <text start="1578.349" dur="4.08">couldn&amp;#39;t live this is why we left and</text>
  <text start="1580.029" dur="5.041">think about it everyone is coming back</text>
  <text start="1582.429" dur="4.44">now all the refugees that left want to</text>
  <text start="1585.07" dur="5.37">come back why do they want to come back</text>
  <text start="1586.869" dur="7.86">if Assad gasses his own people it makes</text>
  <text start="1590.44" dur="8.699">no sense if we use logic and we go back</text>
  <text start="1594.729" dur="6.93">in time we know that the deep state with</text>
  <text start="1599.139" dur="5.49">Obama and the rest they created these</text>
  <text start="1601.659" dur="4.171">paid mercenary forces to take over each</text>
  <text start="1604.629" dur="3.87">and every one of these countries</text>
  <text start="1605.83" dur="3.24">basically they tricked the American</text>
  <text start="1608.499" dur="4.02">public</text>
  <text start="1609.07" dur="5.37">they created a terrorist force and they</text>
  <text start="1612.519" dur="4.71">scare the American public that these</text>
  <text start="1614.44" dur="4.469">terrorists were coming after us and who</text>
  <text start="1617.229" dur="2.7">were the terrorist force they were paid</text>
  <text start="1618.909" dur="2.791">mercenaries controlled by the</text>
  <text start="1619.929" dur="5.07">intelligence agencies here in the United</text>
  <text start="1621.7" dur="7.079">States in the UK in Germany in France</text>
  <text start="1624.999" dur="6.451">and the jig is up Russia now is speaking</text>
  <text start="1628.779" dur="4.98">out China is speaking out Syria is now</text>
  <text start="1631.45" dur="4.5">speaking out they&amp;#39;re pointing the finger</text>
  <text start="1633.759" dur="4.59">of who&amp;#39;s been controlling all these paid</text>
  <text start="1635.95" dur="5.64">mercenary forces and once this is all</text>
  <text start="1638.349" dur="6.091">set and done guess what Syria will be</text>
  <text start="1641.59" dur="5.459">under control of Assad the coalition</text>
  <text start="1644.44" dur="4.859">forces will no longer be needed in this</text>
  <text start="1647.049" dur="4.47">country because the paid mercenary</text>
  <text start="1649.299" dur="3.821">forces would have been wiped out so what</text>
