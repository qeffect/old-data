  <text start="182.849" dur="5.941">banks have been doing for quite a while</text>
  <text start="184.349" dur="9">and he&amp;#39;s taken responsibility showing</text>
  <text start="188.79" dur="8.07">the world that he has taken a poor</text>
  <text start="193.349" dur="6.241">economy and made it absolutely fantastic</text>
  <text start="196.86" dur="5.099">now the other thing that he has done is</text>
  <text start="199.59" dur="4.979">that during this process</text>
  <text start="201.959" dur="5.64">he has been continually telling everyone</text>
  <text start="204.569" dur="7.291">I have been making this economy great</text>
  <text start="207.599" dur="6.631">and if the Fed does not follow along and</text>
  <text start="211.86" dur="5.52">what I&amp;#39;ve been doing what I&amp;#39;m telling</text>
  <text start="214.23" dur="6.539">them to do it will be their fault when</text>
  <text start="217.38" dur="7.04">the economy comes down and it seems like</text>
  <text start="220.769" dur="8.041">that message now is starting to resonate</text>
  <text start="224.42" dur="6.819">with many financial pundits and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="228.81" dur="4.5">putting out opinion pieces saying that</text>
  <text start="231.239" dur="5.611">if something happens to the economy it</text>
  <text start="233.31" dur="5.97">might not be Trump&amp;#39;s fault now what is</text>
  <text start="236.85" dur="5.479">the deep state doing right now they are</text>
  <text start="239.28" dur="5.88">trying to build their own narrative and</text>
  <text start="242.329" dur="6.761">they are trying to contain take control</text>
  <text start="245.16" dur="6.359">and blame Trump for the disaster now</text>
  <text start="249.09" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;ve talked about this the Fed came out</text>
  <text start="251.519" dur="3.72">with this report remember there&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="252.9" dur="5.309">guys and bad guys in the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="255.239" dur="6.291">the Fed came out and said that the</text>
  <text start="258.209" dur="6.481">president with all his tariffs and</text>
  <text start="261.53" dur="6.93">everything that he&amp;#39;s been doing it did</text>
  <text start="264.69" dur="7.47">not work it killed jobs it didn&amp;#39;t help</text>
  <text start="268.46" dur="7.15">manufacturing it was a complete and</text>
  <text start="272.16" dur="5.189">utter disaster now this is coming from</text>
  <text start="275.61" dur="4.83">the bad guys of the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="277.349" dur="5.671">because they want to make sure that when</text>
  <text start="280.44" dur="4.349">this system comes down they are not to</text>
  <text start="283.02" dur="5.1">blame they&amp;#39;re going to try to maneuver</text>
  <text start="284.789" dur="5.541">this and blame it on Trump now on the</text>
  <text start="288.12" dur="5.609">other hand what has Trump been doing</text>
  <text start="290.33" dur="4.91">Trump with all his tweets has been</text>
  <text start="293.729" dur="5.711">showing that</text>
  <text start="295.24" dur="6.39">listen when the Fed raises rates the</text>
  <text start="299.44" dur="5.78">economy doesn&amp;#39;t do well when the Fed</text>
  <text start="301.63" dur="8.28">tightens the economy doesn&amp;#39;t do well and</text>
  <text start="305.22" dur="7.96">if the Fed cuts rates and if the Fed</text>
  <text start="309.91" dur="4.77">pushes stimulus the economy does well</text>
  <text start="313.18" dur="4.38">because this is what I&amp;#39;m telling them to</text>
  <text start="314.68" dur="7.079">do now this is coming out of Bloomberg</text>
  <text start="317.56" dur="6.329">and this is it&amp;#39;s this is the title of</text>
  <text start="321.759" dur="4.681">the article it says central banks are</text>
  <text start="323.889" dur="5.041">the biggest risk to the economy in 2020</text>
  <text start="326.44" dur="3.539">now it says the first time since the</text>
  <text start="328.93" dur="4.049">signing of the Declaration of</text>
  <text start="329.979" dur="5.12">Independence in 1776 the u.s. just</text>
  <text start="332.979" dur="7.261">completed the first calendar decade</text>
  <text start="335.099" dur="7.57">without even one day of a recession now</text>
  <text start="340.24" dur="4.23">remember the federal government has to</text>
  <text start="342.669" dur="4.761">report that we&amp;#39;re in a recession a lot</text>
  <text start="344.47" dur="5.34">of times they never do this until a</text>
  <text start="347.43" dur="4.18">couple months later then they go back</text>
  <text start="349.81" dur="5.039">and say oh yes the recession started on</text>
  <text start="351.61" dur="4.619">this time at this time during the Obama</text>
  <text start="354.849" dur="4.261">administration even with the Trump</text>
  <text start="356.229" dur="3.511">administration the economy the central</text>
  <text start="359.11" dur="3.75">bank system</text>
  <text start="359.74" dur="5.01">I do believe many times it dipped into</text>
  <text start="362.86" dur="4.619">every session just that they never</text>
  <text start="364.75" dur="5.759">reported it but let&amp;#39;s go with this right</text>
  <text start="367.479" dur="5.611">here and it says so what happens when</text>
  <text start="370.509" dur="5.641">central banks pull back from this</text>
  <text start="373.09" dur="6.24">stimulus when the Federal Reserve hinted</text>
  <text start="376.15" dur="4.859">in late 2018 that they were going to</text>
  <text start="379.33" dur="4.2">increase interest rates several more</text>
  <text start="381.009" dur="5.88">times in 2019 and the balance sheet</text>
  <text start="383.53" dur="6.319">reduction was on automatic pilot the S&amp;amp;P</text>
  <text start="386.889" dur="6">500 index plunged almost 20 percent and</text>
  <text start="389.849" dur="6.011">recession fears became prevalent and</text>
  <text start="392.889" dur="5.131">when the Fed partly reversed its stance</text>
  <text start="395.86" dur="3.45">in early 2019 suggesting it would</text>
  <text start="398.02" dur="4.98">increase rates</text>
  <text start="399.31" dur="7.5">recession fears receded and stocks</text>
  <text start="403" dur="8.19">soared to post one of their best years</text>
  <text start="406.81" dur="6.479">ever in terms of returns and of course</text>
  <text start="411.19" dur="5.279">as we know the Washington Post also put</text>
  <text start="413.289" dur="6.391">out an article saying that Trump&amp;#39;s stock</text>
  <text start="416.469" dur="4.611">market economy is not as good as Obama</text>
  <text start="419.68" dur="3.84">and Clinton</text>
  <text start="421.08" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re trying everything to try to</text>
  <text start="423.52" dur="5.369">control this narrative</text>
  <text start="424.83" dur="5.859">let me continue it says central bankers</text>
  <text start="428.889" dur="6">try to operate under the Hippocratic</text>
  <text start="430.689" dur="6.84">oath first do not harm we will not know</text>
  <text start="434.889" dur="5.31">if they have caused any harm until they</text>
  <text start="437.529" dur="4.92">reverse their unprecedented balance</text>
  <text start="440.199" dur="5.27">sheet expansion without incident</text>
  <text start="442.449" dur="4.171">the feds recent experience is not</text>
  <text start="445.469" dur="4.901">encouraging</text>
  <text start="446.62" dur="7.65">they&amp;#39;re already pointing out that we are</text>
  <text start="450.37" dur="8.09">in a manipulated illusionary central</text>
  <text start="454.27" dur="7.949">bank economy and we will find out if</text>
  <text start="458.46" dur="7.69">it&amp;#39;s the feds fault because when they</text>
  <text start="462.219" dur="7.141">reverse their policy where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="466.15" dur="5.489">cutting rates pushing stimulus we will</text>
  <text start="469.36" dur="3.779">find out who is to blame now of course</text>
  <text start="471.639" dur="4.14">what are the Trump of the Patriots going</text>
  <text start="473.139" dur="5.161">to do at this point they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="475.779" dur="5.371">make it perfectly clear that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="478.3" dur="5.369">want the Fed to do this now we know the</text>
  <text start="481.15" dur="5.129">Fed the good guys in the Fed they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="483.669" dur="6.33">going to go along with what Trump wants</text>
