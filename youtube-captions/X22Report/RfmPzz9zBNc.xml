  <text start="264.849" dur="5.011">seeing the same exact things nothing is</text>
  <text start="267.37" dur="4.109">getting better and of course every time</text>
  <text start="269.86" dur="4.109">a government official is out there</text>
  <text start="271.479" dur="3.25">telling you one thing it is always the</text>
  <text start="273.969" dur="3.491">opposite</text>
  <text start="274.729" dur="6.18">back in 2013 when he was out there and</text>
  <text start="277.46" dur="5.009">the European Union was out there letting</text>
  <text start="280.909" dur="5.34">everyone know there was a recovery we</text>
  <text start="282.469" dur="6.151">all knew at that time that this was a</text>
  <text start="286.249" dur="4.741">complete show because they thought they</text>
  <text start="288.62" dur="3.9">were going to have this event in Syria</text>
  <text start="290.99" dur="3.449">they thought everything was going to be</text>
  <text start="292.52" dur="3.78">fine or they were going to start a war</text>
  <text start="294.439" dur="3.09">because they thought they were going to</text>
  <text start="296.3" dur="3.66">they were going to be able to remove</text>
  <text start="297.529" dur="5.19">Assad at that time and we can see all</text>
  <text start="299.96" dur="6.209">the way up to this point here we are</text>
  <text start="302.719" dur="6.09">once again almost one year later and we</text>
  <text start="306.169" dur="4.53">see absolutely no improvements</text>
  <text start="308.809" dur="3.75">whatsoever to the economy now of course</text>
  <text start="310.699" dur="3.511">the government officials are all out</text>
  <text start="312.559" dur="4.44">there and they&amp;#39;re letting us know yes we</text>
  <text start="314.21" dur="5.519">do have a recovery things are getting</text>
  <text start="316.999" dur="4.5">better but every single company now is</text>
  <text start="319.729" dur="4.141">starting to come forward they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="321.499" dur="4.98">starting to admit that you know what it</text>
  <text start="323.87" dur="4.62">really wasn&amp;#39;t the weather it really is</text>
  <text start="326.479" dur="4.951">the economy McDonald is out there now</text>
  <text start="328.49" dur="4.739">saying that the franchisees are looking</text>
  <text start="331.43" dur="3.93">at the sales outlook for the next six</text>
  <text start="333.229" dur="4.05">months and guess what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="335.36" dur="4.799">that things are completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="337.279" dur="6.241">and one of their issues is what is</text>
  <text start="340.159" dur="5.1">happening in the economy and despite the</text>
  <text start="343.52" dur="3.989">hopes that the US consumer would show</text>
  <text start="345.259" dur="4.74">signs of being a in a better footing</text>
  <text start="347.509" dur="4.5">they are seeing that it is getting worse</text>
  <text start="349.999" dur="3.78">people are just not spending the money</text>
  <text start="352.009" dur="3.45">and of course they&amp;#39;re keeping the</text>
  <text start="353.779" dur="3.63">illusion live with these unemployment</text>
  <text start="355.459" dur="4.531">numbers which are absolutely meaningless</text>
  <text start="357.409" dur="4.26">we discussed many times in all the</text>
  <text start="359.99" dur="3.299">different reports that I&amp;#39;ve done how</text>
  <text start="361.669" dur="4.53">they manipulate the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="363.289" dur="5.761">and we know that unemployment is much</text>
  <text start="366.199" dur="5.821">much higher it is around 30 to 37</text>
  <text start="369.05" dur="4.589">percent depending on which calculation</text>
  <text start="372.02" dur="4.5">you go with even if you take thirty</text>
  <text start="373.639" dur="5.61">percent you can see that the country</text>
  <text start="376.52" dur="4.379">cannot survive with this many people</text>
  <text start="379.249" dur="3.6">unemployed and if you go to the youth</text>
  <text start="380.899" dur="3.781">unemployment it is actually much worse</text>
  <text start="382.849" dur="3.84">and they&amp;#39;re saying that eighty percent</text>
  <text start="384.68" dur="4.889">of the college graduates cannot even</text>
  <text start="386.689" dur="5.28">find a job they&amp;#39;re getting part-time</text>
  <text start="389.569" dur="4.5">jobs living with their parents can&amp;#39;t pay</text>
  <text start="391.969" dur="4.95">for the student loans and this is the</text>
  <text start="394.069" dur="6">foundation for the next generation if we</text>
  <text start="396.919" dur="6.6">do not have this foundation moving up</text>
  <text start="400.069" dur="6.45">and saving money spending money and</text>
  <text start="403.519" dur="5.01">retail saving money to buy a home guess</text>
  <text start="406.519" dur="3.72">what this whole thing is going to</text>
  <text start="408.529" dur="4.62">fall apart and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="410.239" dur="5.37">we&amp;#39;re seeing we are seeing now that the</text>
  <text start="413.149" dur="6.45">industrial production has dropped and</text>
  <text start="415.609" dur="7.32">missed most uh missed by most since</text>

  <text start="422.929" dur="4.91">production mystic expectations capacity</text>
  <text start="425.809" dur="4.92">utilization also missed expectations</text>
  <text start="427.839" dur="6.04">most worrying is the manufacturing</text>
  <text start="430.729" dur="6.3">industry mere point 1 percent gain in</text>
  <text start="433.879" dur="4.38">June the slowest increase since January</text>
  <text start="437.029" dur="3.54">now of course they&amp;#39;re all out there</text>

  <text start="451.879" dur="5.43">higher than it is today and what</text>
  <text start="455.179" dur="5.76">happened in 2008 and this was during the</text>
  <text start="457.309" dur="8.28">summer what happened in october november</text>
  <text start="460.939" dur="8.58">december going into 2009 a complete</text>
  <text start="465.589" dur="6.24">collapse of the real estate market so we</text>
  <text start="469.519" dur="4.92">really can&amp;#39;t use the home builder</text>

  <text start="1593.23" dur="8.34">right now now a former US intelligence</text>
  <text start="1597.06" dur="7.27">officer is blaming the Hamas truce</text>
  <text start="1601.57" dur="4.38">breakdown on Israel Israel is to blame</text>
  <text start="1604.33" dur="4.38">for the breakdown of a short-lived</text>

  <text start="1626.049" dur="4.561">all the information available to me</text>
  <text start="1628.36" dur="4.62">indicates that Hamas was not consulted</text>
  <text start="1630.61" dur="4.71">on the kit on the ceasefire proposal and</text>
  <text start="1632.98" dur="5.549">that none of Hamas proposed conditions</text>
  <text start="1635.32" dur="6.27">were up for debate this seems very very</text>
  <text start="1638.529" dur="5.341">familiar with let&amp;#39;s say the Syrian talks</text>
  <text start="1641.59" dur="4.89">to Geneva 2 talks where the United</text>

  <text start="1676.2" dur="5.89">Hamas had offered perfectly legitimate</text>

  <text start="1828.31" dur="7.38">do it by using these type of methods</text>
  <text start="1832.66" dur="5.99">they do it by distracting people by</text>
  <text start="1835.69" dur="6.17">creating incidences that really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1838.65" dur="5.8">are not really there and they are</text>
  <text start="1841.86" dur="5.2">continually doing this and we can see</text>
  <text start="1844.45" dur="5.46">this coming out of Israel we see it</text>
  <text start="1847.06" dur="5.49">coming out of Ukraine we see it coming</text>
  <text start="1849.91" dur="5.31">out of the puppet regimes in the Middle</text>
  <text start="1852.55" dur="5.28">East we see it coming out of France and</text>
  <text start="1855.22" dur="4.44">Spain and especially here in the United</text>
  <text start="1857.83" dur="5.19">States because as we know there are</text>
  <text start="1859.66" dur="5.85">trolls running around the web attacking</text>
  <text start="1863.02" dur="4.35">alternative media cloning people</text>
  <text start="1865.51" dur="4.2">pretending that there&amp;#39;s someone when</text>
  <text start="1867.37" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re really not making comments on</text>
  <text start="1869.71" dur="5.63">everyone&amp;#39;s youtube channel or on their</text>
  <text start="1872.38" dur="4.73">sites or on Facebook and you can see</text>
  <text start="1875.34" dur="4.74">the only reason they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="1877.11" dur="5.22">because they&amp;#39;re worried about the truth</text>
  <text start="1880.08" dur="3.9">getting out there because if they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1882.33" dur="4.56">been telling the truth there would be</text>
  <text start="1883.98" dur="4.74">nothing to be worried about they</text>
  <text start="1886.89" dur="3.9">wouldn&amp;#39;t have to worry they wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1888.72" dur="4.7">have to use trolls they wouldn&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="1890.79" dur="6.72">pay people to post because the truth</text>
  <text start="1893.42" dur="7.39">stands on its own two feet when you lie</text>
  <text start="1897.51" dur="5.28">you need more lies to cover it up and</text>
  <text start="1900.81" dur="5.58">you can see that every single government</text>
  <text start="1902.79" dur="6.18">is doing the same exact thing now Iran</text>
  <text start="1906.39" dur="6.06">is out there and they are ready to offer</text>
  <text start="1908.97" dur="5.64">relief aid to Gaza the Iranian Health</text>
  <text start="1912.45" dur="4.35">Minister has expressed that they are</text>
  <text start="1914.61" dur="6.27">ready to help the people in Gaza with</text>
  <text start="1916.8" dur="8.31">anything that they need now something is</text>
  <text start="1920.88" dur="6.3">happening in Iraq in Baghdad and people</text>
  <text start="1925.11" dur="5.76">out there are reporting witnesses are</text>
  <text start="1927.18" dur="6.18">saying that there are huge commercial</text>
  <text start="1930.87" dur="5.46">movement in the past few days it</text>
  <text start="1933.36" dur="6.11">observed a lot of cargo operations of</text>
  <text start="1936.33" dur="5.67">receiving transfer goods coming in and</text>
  <text start="1939.47" dur="5.53">they don&amp;#39;t know what it is but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1942" dur="5.87">continuous and ongoing so I wonder if</text>
  <text start="1945" dur="6.78">something really big is planned out in</text>
  <text start="1947.87" dur="7">Iraq now it seems like Edward Snowden</text>
  <text start="1951.78" dur="5.58">and his NSA documents that he has is</text>
  <text start="1954.87" dur="5.07">revealing some interesting information I</text>
  <text start="1957.36" dur="5.64">mean we kind of knew all this but we see</text>
  <text start="1959.94" dur="4.86">that the the informer employee of the US</text>
  <text start="1963" dur="4.47">National Security Agency Edward Snowden</text>
  <text start="1964.8" dur="4.5">has revealed that the British and</text>
  <text start="1967.47" dur="4.89">American intelligence and the Mossad</text>
  <text start="1969.3" dur="5.76">worked together to create the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1972.36" dur="5.1">State of Iraq and Syria Soudan said</text>
  <text start="1975.06" dur="5.28">intelligence services of three countries</text>
  <text start="1977.46" dur="5.01">created a terrorist organization that is</text>
  <text start="1980.34" dur="4.98">able to attract all extremists of the</text>
  <text start="1982.47" dur="5.79">world to one place using a strategy</text>
  <text start="1985.32" dur="5.61">called the hornet&amp;#39;s nest leaks revealed</text>
  <text start="1988.26" dur="5.61">that Isis leader and cleric Bagga daddy</text>
  <text start="1990.93" dur="4.65">took intensive military training for a</text>
  <text start="1993.87" dur="5.49">whole year in the hands of Mossad</text>
  <text start="1995.58" dur="6.81">besides courses and theology and the art</text>
  <text start="1999.36" dur="8.01">of speech so we can see that this whole</text>
  <text start="2002.39" dur="7.49">entire Islamic state terrorism was</text>
  <text start="2007.37" dur="6.27">ginned up by you</text>
  <text start="2009.88" dur="7.66">England United States Israel and other</text>
  <text start="2013.64" dur="7.5">Arab nations this is a operation to</text>
  <text start="2017.54" dur="7.29">create chaos in the Middle East and to</text>
  <text start="2021.14" dur="5.25">strike fear in everyone that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2024.83" dur="5.58">getting ready to attack because they</text>
  <text start="2026.39" dur="6.6">needed a new poster child to create this</text>
  <text start="2030.41" dur="5.1">event because they realize the Middle</text>
  <text start="2032.99" dur="4.71">East is completely falling apart they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2035.51" dur="4.74">losing control and they realized just</text>
  <text start="2037.7" dur="4.11">using these drone strikes have not been</text>
  <text start="2040.25" dur="3.21">keeping the tribes back from</text>
  <text start="2041.81" dur="3.6">overthrowing the puppet regime and</text>
  <text start="2043.46" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re very very worried at this point</text>
  <text start="2045.41" dur="2.85">and this is why they needed something</text>
  <text start="2047" dur="2.7">like this and create it and this is why</text>
  <text start="2048.26" dur="3.63">they created this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2049.7" dur="5.459">training these people in Jordan at</text>
  <text start="2051.89" dur="5.49">secret bases because we knew that Assad</text>
  <text start="2055.159" dur="4.77">was running for election they knew that</text>
  <text start="2057.38" dur="5.039">he was going to win he knew the this</text>
  <text start="2059.929" dur="4.081">entire fight of these moderates which is</text>
  <text start="2062.419" dur="3.181">really part of the same group they can</text>
  <text start="2064.01" dur="3.6">call them whatever they want they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="2065.6" dur="4.29">intertwined their part of the whole same</text>
  <text start="2067.61" dur="5.67">thing they supply them all with weapons</text>
  <text start="2069.89" dur="5.039">and they knew that Assad had the support</text>
  <text start="2073.28" dur="3.66">of the people so they had to use a</text>
  <text start="2074.929" dur="4.381">different tactic now their goals are</text>
  <text start="2076.94" dur="4.979">exactly the same nothing has changed</text>
  <text start="2079.31" dur="4.26">they need to take control of the Middle</text>
  <text start="2081.919" dur="4.591">East because they see Libya Lebanon</text>
  <text start="2083.57" dur="5.87">Yemen Iraq completely falling apart they</text>
  <text start="2086.51" dur="6.419">see tribes rising up and yes there are</text>
  <text start="2089.44" dur="7.15">tribes inside Iraq that are outside and</text>
  <text start="2092.929" dur="5.101">separate from the Islamic state this is</text>
  <text start="2096.59" dur="3.84">where the United States government is</text>
  <text start="2098.03" dur="4.41">having a problem because they cannot</text>
  <text start="2100.43" dur="4.32">control them the Islamic state they can</text>
  <text start="2102.44" dur="5.4">control same thing happening in libya</text>
  <text start="2104.75" dur="5.34">and lebanon and and yemen the tribes</text>
  <text start="2107.84" dur="3.87">there they cannot control what is</text>
  <text start="2110.09" dur="3.66">happening and they&amp;#39;re nervous about this</text>
  <text start="2111.71" dur="3.89">and this is why they continually use the</text>
  <text start="2113.75" dur="5.7">propaganda that the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="2115.6" dur="6.19">expanding across into Lebanon and then</text>
  <text start="2119.45" dur="3.84">into Libya and then into Yemen and</text>
  <text start="2121.79" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re even going to go to Spain and</text>
  <text start="2123.29" dur="6.57">France and everywhere they want this to</text>
  <text start="2126.38" dur="6.24">look tremendous they wanted to look</text>
  <text start="2129.86" dur="5.88">bigger than life to convince you that</text>
  <text start="2132.62" dur="5.07">when this terrorist hit it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="2135.74" dur="4.83">hit big here in the United States and</text>
  <text start="2137.69" dur="4.01">this is why Obama wants that main switch</text>
  <text start="2140.57" dur="3.049">to Brock</text>
  <text start="2141.7" dur="4.11">as to everyone in the United States at</text>
  <text start="2143.619" dur="4.74">the same time when an act of war or</text>
  <text start="2145.81" dur="5.48">terrorism hits the United States now we</text>
  <text start="2148.359" dur="5.941">can see right now that the US has not</text>
  <text start="2151.29" dur="6.88">evacuated the US Embassy in Libya the UN</text>
  <text start="2154.3" dur="5.789">has removed their personnel fighting has</text>
  <text start="2158.17" dur="4.62">increased their airports are closed down</text>
  <text start="2160.089" dur="4.711">and they are still not a vacuum they</text>
  <text start="2162.79" dur="3.99">have travel advisories in effect but</text>
  <text start="2164.8" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re still keeping the US Embassy</text>
  <text start="2166.78" dur="3.24">open because they really don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="2168.73" dur="3.51">start evacuating because they&amp;#39;re afraid</text>
  <text start="2170.02" dur="4.38">once they do this everything will</text>
  <text start="2172.24" dur="5.369">completely fall and that will be the end</text>
  <text start="2174.4" dur="6.689">of that in Libya and they&amp;#39;re not ready</text>
  <text start="2177.609" dur="5.73">to push the Islamic state agenda for</text>
  <text start="2181.089" dur="4.891">just yet it&amp;#39;s still forming they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2183.339" dur="5.461">still working it out there still pushing</text>
  <text start="2185.98" dur="4.41">and pushing it further and further but</text>
  <text start="2188.8" dur="3.99">they haven&amp;#39;t reached the point where</text>
  <text start="2190.39" dur="6.6">they can say okay the event is ready to</text>
  <text start="2192.79" dur="6.12">go now Jack Lew he is out there and he</text>
  <text start="2196.99" dur="4.17">is saying that hundreds of cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="2198.91" dur="4.86">against US banks and other institutions</text>
  <text start="2201.16" dur="5.189">in recent years represent a targeted</text>
  <text start="2203.77" dur="5.849">attempt to more broadly disrupt the US</text>
  <text start="2206.349" dur="6.48">financial system now Jack Lew is the</text>
  <text start="2209.619" dur="5.521">Treasury secretary and lewd did not</text>
  <text start="2212.829" dur="4.441">single out any suspected countries or</text>
  <text start="2215.14" dur="5.76">organizations behind the attacks but he</text>
  <text start="2217.27" dur="6.27">did say that this potential of these</text>
  <text start="2220.9" dur="6.12">cyber attacks coming over from whatever</text>
  <text start="2223.54" dur="7.74">actors they are could cause massive</text>
  <text start="2227.02" dur="5.94">economic damage if core operational</text>
  <text start="2231.28" dur="4.38">functions of major financial</text>
  <text start="2232.96" dur="5.43">institutions were compromised they are</text>
  <text start="2235.66" dur="4.32">setting the stage look how this is all</text>
  <text start="2238.39" dur="3.929">being planned out it&amp;#39;s amazing to me</text>
  <text start="2239.98" dur="4.109">right now they&amp;#39;re out there saying we</text>
  <text start="2242.319" dur="4.201">have a huge amount of cyber attacks and</text>
  <text start="2244.089" dur="5.851">of course this is playing into the bill</text>
  <text start="2246.52" dur="6.079">cissa or sista which they want passed</text>
  <text start="2249.94" dur="6.149">and they&amp;#39;re using this and they can also</text>
  <text start="2252.599" dur="5.081">use this to show that another actor</text>
  <text start="2256.089" dur="3.211">brought down the economy and this is why</text>
  <text start="2257.68" dur="4.32">he&amp;#39;s out there saying this this was</text>
  <text start="2259.3" dur="4.289">today that he was reporting on this he</text>
  <text start="2262" dur="5.13">also said coupled with attacks on</text>
  <text start="2263.589" dur="5.851">companies and utilities an incursion and</text>
  <text start="2267.13" dur="4.68">strategic point along the network could</text>
  <text start="2269.44" dur="5.7">lead to market disruption and massive</text>
  <text start="2271.81" dur="5.7">harm it also could shut down</text>
  <text start="2275.14" dur="5.37">down the power grid and infrastructure</text>
  <text start="2277.51" dur="5.67">so we can see right now they are paving</text>
  <text start="2280.51" dur="5.13">the road here letting everyone know that</text>
  <text start="2283.18" dur="4.53">when the cyber attack hits it will bring</text>
  <text start="2285.64" dur="3.87">the economy to its knees because once</text>
  <text start="2287.71" dur="3.3">the financial institutions are hit of</text>
  <text start="2289.51" dur="2.85">course we know they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="2291.01" dur="4.2">hit from an outside source it will be</text>
  <text start="2292.36" dur="4.59">inside they will then enact the Ballon</text>
  <text start="2295.21" dur="4.17">documents which would they would like to</text>
  <text start="2296.95" dur="4.86">have to every single bank not just the</text>
  <text start="2299.38" dur="4.59">big ones and you can see they&amp;#39;ll freeze</text>
  <text start="2301.81" dur="4.11">everyone&amp;#39;s account put capital controls</text>
  <text start="2303.97" dur="5.04">in effect and eventually what will occur</text>
  <text start="2305.92" dur="7.05">is martial law to rally the people up</text>
  <text start="2309.01" dur="6.66">and have them look at another group and</text>
  <text start="2312.97" dur="4.95">say we need to go to war we were in this</text>
  <text start="2315.67" dur="4.35">recovery they brought the economy to its</text>
  <text start="2317.92" dur="4.2">knees and we need to do something at</text>
