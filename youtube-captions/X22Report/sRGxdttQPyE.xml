  <text start="109.649" dur="5.161">default on it and then the IMF is stuck</text>

  <text start="121.469" dur="4.86">a lot of complaints from other countries</text>
  <text start="123.509" dur="6.961">so this really puts them in a corner at</text>
  <text start="126.329" dur="6.63">this time now the OSCE out in Ukraine is</text>
  <text start="130.47" dur="5.76">saying that the violations of the men&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="132.959" dur="6.421">PC the Mint&amp;#39;s ceasefire agreement have</text>
  <text start="136.23" dur="5.009">increased over time and they are</text>
  <text start="139.38" dur="4.62">stationed right now in the Donetsk</text>
  <text start="141.239" dur="4.651">region the special monitoring mission of</text>
  <text start="144" dur="4.829">the Organization for Security and</text>
  <text start="145.89" dur="4.349">Cooperation in Europe is watching what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="148.829" dur="5.301">going on here and they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="150.239" dur="7.851">continually shelling coming from Kiev</text>
  <text start="154.13" dur="7.74">from the government-held areas and</text>
  <text start="158.09" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;re saying that yes they have</text>
  <text start="161.87" dur="6.13">continually</text>
  <text start="164.72" dur="5.74">shelled bombed the area and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="168" dur="6.15">violating the Minsk ceasefire agreement</text>
  <text start="170.46" dur="5.91">and we realize that they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="174.15" dur="3.63">pick this up now and as we notice we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="176.37" dur="3.09">getting closer and closer to the end of</text>
  <text start="177.78" dur="6.27">the year when this mins to ceasefire</text>
  <text start="179.46" dur="6.99">agreement expires and I think at this</text>
  <text start="184.05" dur="4.14">time with the United States in there</text>
  <text start="186.45" dur="3.3">with the UK in there and other countries</text>
  <text start="188.19" dur="2.75">in their training the National Guard the</text>
  <text start="189.75" dur="6.75">Armed Forces bringing in weapons</text>
  <text start="190.94" dur="7.9">defensive and non defensive weapons we</text>
  <text start="196.5" dur="4.53">can see at this point that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="198.84" dur="5.49">getting ready for a major major</text>
  <text start="201.03" dur="4.77">offensive and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="204.33" dur="3.96">really going to push it hard to try to</text>
  <text start="205.8" dur="5.43">start something now let me explain how</text>
  <text start="208.29" dur="6.18">this might go down because we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="211.23" dur="4.02">reports that Isis which is the proxy</text>
  <text start="214.47" dur="3.06">army for United States government</text>
  <text start="215.25" dur="7.7">central bankers bought anti-aircraft</text>
  <text start="217.53" dur="7.98">missiles in Ukraine via Kuwait cell</text>
  <text start="222.95" dur="5.23">kuwait has uncovered an international</text>
  <text start="225.51" dur="6.63">cell that supplied the islamic state</text>
  <text start="228.18" dur="7.26">with weapons bought in ukraine and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="232.14" dur="5.52">seeing now that Ukraine is saying well</text>
  <text start="235.44" dur="4.59">we have no information on this</text>
  <text start="237.66" dur="3.75">whatsoever Ukraine has not produced or</text>
  <text start="240.03" dur="5.28">purchase chinese-made anti-aircraft</text>
  <text start="241.41" dur="6.42">missile systems and which is meaningless</text>
  <text start="245.31" dur="4.71">because you can get them and smuggling</text>
  <text start="247.83" dur="3.99">through Ukraine down into where they</text>
  <text start="250.02" dur="5.28">need them and we&amp;#39;ve seen this done</text>
  <text start="251.82" dur="5.46">before but the FN 6 anti-aircraft</text>
  <text start="255.3" dur="4.74">missile system has never been</text>
  <text start="257.28" dur="5.22">operational in Ukraine which is</text>
  <text start="260.04" dur="3.9">absolutely meaningless also because when</text>
  <text start="262.5" dur="4.56">you&amp;#39;re moving arms it doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="263.94" dur="5.1">you&amp;#39;re using these arms but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="267.06" dur="4.77">interesting about everything that came</text>
  <text start="269.04" dur="7.52">out here ukraine&amp;#39;s engineer interior</text>
  <text start="271.83" dur="7.88">ministry said that hmm on many occasions</text>
  <text start="276.56" dur="8.95">the illegal arms trade in the country</text>
  <text start="279.71" dur="10.02">has been increasing in the southeastern</text>
  <text start="285.51" dur="6.75">area and it has increased considerably</text>
  <text start="289.73" dur="5.89">with seventy percent of the weapons</text>
  <text start="292.26" dur="4.89">coming from the area in the Donbass</text>
  <text start="295.62" dur="4.8">region</text>
  <text start="297.15" dur="8.01">and they might have supplied the Islamic</text>
  <text start="300.42" dur="7.86">state with weapons so you can see what</text>
  <text start="305.16" dur="4.52">they&amp;#39;re building up to right now you can</text>
  <text start="308.28" dur="3.87">see where they&amp;#39;re headed with this</text>
  <text start="309.68" dur="5.5">they&amp;#39;re trying to make it seem like the</text>
  <text start="312.15" dur="6.21">southeastern people are part of this</text>
  <text start="315.18" dur="4.32">Islamic state terror group which is the</text>
  <text start="318.36" dur="4.14">proxy army for the United States</text>
  <text start="319.5" dur="5.13">government and the coalition forces but</text>
  <text start="322.5" dur="4.62">that doesn&amp;#39;t matter they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="324.63" dur="4.62">convince everyone this is why this new</text>
  <text start="327.12" dur="4.2">offense is this new offensive is going</text>
  <text start="329.25" dur="4.5">to be needed and they&amp;#39;re going to push</text>
  <text start="331.32" dur="5.43">this hard and we&amp;#39;re going to see it</text>
  <text start="333.75" dur="5.07">accelerate as we approach the end of</text>
  <text start="336.75" dur="5.55">this year now it looks like we had</text>
  <text start="338.82" dur="6.63">another incident which involved a</text>
  <text start="342.3" dur="5.88">Russian bomber military sources in the</text>
  <text start="345.45" dur="4.83">UK say the British fighter jets have</text>
  <text start="348.18" dur="5.22">taken off from the airbase in Scotland</text>
  <text start="350.28" dur="6.6">to intercept a Russian bomber passing</text>
  <text start="353.4" dur="6.96">close to the UK&amp;#39;s airspace and they set</text>
  <text start="356.88" dur="6.54">up they sent up the British jets to</text>
  <text start="360.36" dur="6.3">intercept the tu-160 blackjack which is</text>
  <text start="363.42" dur="6.06">a supersonic bomber and they escorted it</text>
  <text start="366.66" dur="5.28">until it was clear of the UK now we know</text>
  <text start="369.48" dur="6">the Russian Palmer wasn&amp;#39;t doing anything</text>
  <text start="371.94" dur="6.15">in this area we know this was done to</text>
  <text start="375.48" dur="6.81">make it look like Russia&amp;#39;s flying very</text>
  <text start="378.09" dur="7.08">close to the UK to build up that uneasy</text>
  <text start="382.29" dur="4.83">feeling that Russia is the enemy and</text>
  <text start="385.17" dur="4.47">look they&amp;#39;re flying another bomber and</text>
  <text start="387.12" dur="5.43">we know they&amp;#39;re bringing bombers in and</text>
  <text start="389.64" dur="6.56">out of where Syria is they&amp;#39;re flying it</text>
  <text start="392.55" dur="6.72">across the areas and the u.s. the</text>
  <text start="396.2" dur="4.9">British and every other country does the</text>
  <text start="399.27" dur="7.32">same thing they were in international</text>
  <text start="401.1" dur="9.9">airspace and it is not a problem now the</text>
  <text start="406.59" dur="8.16">French military will be working with the</text>
  <text start="411" dur="7.62">Russian defence ministry and this has</text>
  <text start="414.75" dur="7.43">come out after the false flag attack in</text>
  <text start="418.62" dur="7.31">France and what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is</text>
  <text start="422.18" dur="6.19">France playing both sides right now</text>
  <text start="425.93" dur="3.46">they&amp;#39;re nervous about the United States</text>
  <text start="428.37" dur="2.73">because we know the United States</text>
  <text start="429.39" dur="4.5">government central bankers are trying</text>
  <text start="431.1" dur="4.74">to bring Europe into a war we know</text>
  <text start="433.89" dur="4.89">Hollen was out there it&amp;#39;s an act of war</text>
  <text start="435.84" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s an act of war it&amp;#39;s an act of war so</text>
  <text start="438.78" dur="5.16">he&amp;#39;s pleasing the US government central</text>
  <text start="441.39" dur="4.8">bankers on the other hand he&amp;#39;s working</text>
  <text start="443.94" dur="5.76">with Russia and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="446.19" dur="5.7">this in the economies of countries where</text>
  <text start="449.7" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re using the dollar but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="451.89" dur="4.08">setting up the bilateral trade with</text>
  <text start="453.9" dur="4.74">China and they&amp;#39;re setting up the</text>
  <text start="455.97" dur="4.74">clearinghouses for the u1 because all</text>
  <text start="458.64" dur="4.8">these countries know eventually they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="460.71" dur="4.92">going to have to choose sides and this</text>
  <text start="463.44" dur="3.63">is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and this</text>
  <text start="465.63" dur="4.68">is going to pose a problem for the</text>
  <text start="467.07" dur="6.93">United States now what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="470.31" dur="8.48">that there are a lot of things taking</text>
  <text start="474" dur="8.82">place today in Africa we understand that</text>
  <text start="478.79" dur="7.18">25 US military personnel were in bar</text>
  <text start="482.82" dur="5.97">nako at the time of the hotel incident</text>
  <text start="485.97" dur="7.35">in Malley we understand there was some</text>
  <text start="488.79" dur="6.48">type of terror going on there and they</text>
  <text start="493.32" dur="8.16">just the troops just happened to be</text>
  <text start="495.27" dur="8.58">there and basically why were they there</text>
  <text start="501.48" dur="4.74">because if we go back in time Defense</text>
  <text start="503.85" dur="4.8">Secretary Leon Panetta said Tuesday that</text>
  <text start="506.22" dur="3.9">the u.s. had ruled out putting any</text>
  <text start="508.65" dur="5.34">American troops on the ground in Malley</text>
  <text start="510.12" dur="5.849">and they were hoping that the French</text>
  <text start="513.99" dur="5.84">will succeed in establishing better</text>
  <text start="515.969" dur="7.351">security for the West African nation but</text>
  <text start="519.83" dur="6.58">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="523.32" dur="7.95">already had troops in the area and they</text>
  <text start="526.41" dur="8.9">helped with the situation now the</text>
  <text start="531.27" dur="7.2">question is why is the United States in</text>
  <text start="535.31" dur="5.77">Africa right now why are we seeing these</text>
  <text start="538.47" dur="5.67">terrorist attacks why are they bringing</text>
  <text start="541.08" dur="4.68">troops into this area well remember</text>
  <text start="544.14" dur="2.79">wherever China and Russia are that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="545.76" dur="4.74">where the United States is going to be</text>
  <text start="546.93" dur="6.18">and it looks like at this point the US</text>
  <text start="550.5" dur="6.63">and the private western central bank</text>
  <text start="553.11" dur="7.8">countries are trying to keep Africa out</text>
  <text start="557.13" dur="5.94">of reach from China and Russia because</text>
  <text start="560.91" dur="3.52">as we know China is helping build their</text>
  <text start="563.07" dur="3.04">infrastructure</text>
  <text start="564.43" dur="5.219">and if they keep using terror terror</text>
  <text start="566.11" dur="6.96">terror it puts everything on a delay it</text>
  <text start="569.649" dur="5.791">pushes the BRIC nations back and it</text>
  <text start="573.07" dur="5.85">delays everything because the bricks</text>
  <text start="575.44" dur="6.959">want to set up banks in this area to</text>
  <text start="578.92" dur="5.88">help these countries and the United</text>
  <text start="582.399" dur="7.201">States is trying to stop them at all</text>
  <text start="584.8" dur="8.37">costs and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that the</text>
  <text start="589.6" dur="5.429">Islamic state is everywhere and this is</text>
  <text start="593.17" dur="4.38">what we said was going to happen because</text>
  <text start="595.029" dur="4.62">we know the authorization for war allows</text>
  <text start="597.55" dur="4.56">the United States to go after the</text>
  <text start="599.649" dur="4.621">Islamic state al-qaeda bokhoram</text>
  <text start="602.11" dur="4.65">al-shabaab or any other terrorist group</text>
  <text start="604.27" dur="5.91">anywhere in the world and this is what</text>
  <text start="606.76" dur="4.8">they really want passed and we can see</text>
  <text start="610.18" dur="4.56">right now they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="611.56" dur="5.94">Islamic state might be sending dozens of</text>
  <text start="614.74" dur="6.09">suicide bombers to the Malaysian Asian</text>
  <text start="617.5" dur="5.01">summit and we have to remember there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="620.83" dur="4.65">going to be a lot of leaders there the</text>
  <text start="622.51" dur="4.92">US Russia Japan China they&amp;#39;re all set to</text>
  <text start="625.48" dur="3.66">gather this weekend so we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="627.43" dur="6.779">have to watch that very very carefully</text>
  <text start="629.14" dur="8.76">and then we had alleged suicide bombers</text>
  <text start="634.209" dur="6.061">in Yemen now remember Yemen the who</text>
  <text start="637.9" dur="5.22">thiis kept on saying al-qaeda is not</text>
  <text start="640.27" dur="5.72">here the Islamic state is not here it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="643.12" dur="6.15">us we&amp;#39;re the ones fighting but we know</text>
  <text start="645.99" dur="5.8">the United States has been transporting</text>
  <text start="649.27" dur="6.3">the Islamic state from Syria into Libya</text>
  <text start="651.79" dur="8.4">and into Yemen and there was a videotape</text>
  <text start="655.57" dur="6.209">that showed the bomb going off but it</text>
  <text start="660.19" dur="5.73">could be anything because it was far</text>
  <text start="661.779" dur="8.911">away and they can be using this to prove</text>
  <text start="665.92" dur="8.909">that al-qaeda and the Islamic state are</text>
  <text start="670.69" dur="6.33">in Yemen which will help in the end</text>
  <text start="674.829" dur="3.601">because the United States wants to go</text>
  <text start="677.02" dur="4.47">back into each one of these countries</text>
  <text start="678.43" dur="5.88">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that in</text>
  <text start="681.49" dur="5.82">Yemen they were reporting that it was Al</text>
  <text start="684.31" dur="5.519">Qaeda and then Rida cats site</text>
  <text start="687.31" dur="5.399">intelligence said that the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="689.829" dur="5.461">took credit for all of this so we can</text>
  <text start="692.709" dur="3.991">see what&amp;#39;s happening right now is all</text>
  <text start="695.29" dur="3.06">the terrorist groups are getting</text>
  <text start="696.7" dur="6.24">involved</text>
  <text start="698.35" dur="9.66">and their stories are crossing now Libya</text>
  <text start="702.94" dur="7.11">the puppet government in Libya says</text>
  <text start="708.01" dur="5.13">Libya may become the new sanctuary of</text>
  <text start="710.05" dur="6.18">terrorist organizations which is the</text>
  <text start="713.14" dur="7.11">Islamic state and they are asking right</text>
  <text start="716.23" dur="6.9">now that they join the calls for</text>
  <text start="720.25" dur="5.49">international action against the Islamic</text>
  <text start="723.13" dur="9.12">state just like everyone is doing in</text>

  <text start="779.47" dur="4.89">each other and this is what the agenda</text>
  <text start="781.39" dur="5.75">is all about and there&amp;#39;s many different</text>
  <text start="784.36" dur="7.47">agendas associated with this in Europe</text>
  <text start="787.14" dur="8.32">they want the Schengen completely done</text>

  <text start="816" dur="9.13">different agendas and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="820" dur="8.4">is a Soros backed group launches a bid</text>
  <text start="825.13" dur="6.959">to keep Syrian refugees flowing into the</text>
  <text start="828.4" dur="8.159">United States that&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="832.089" dur="7.081">and we know Soros has basically started</text>
  <text start="836.559" dur="6.601">many different kuz around the world he</text>

  <text start="848.379" dur="7.591">and we can see he pushes all these</text>
  <text start="853.809" dur="5.491">different agendas now we have to</text>
  <text start="855.97" dur="7.589">remember this agenda right now is to</text>
  <text start="859.3" dur="9.99">bring in refugees illegals into the</text>
  <text start="863.559" dur="9.541">country to satisfy Obama&amp;#39;s need to prop</text>

  <text start="873.1" dur="4.859">this country this has 90 a lot of people</text>
  <text start="875.769" dur="4.651">think like oh this has to do with saving</text>
  <text start="877.959" dur="4.531">the people but you remember the United</text>
  <text start="880.42" dur="4.56">States caused all this you have to</text>
  <text start="882.49" dur="4.98">remember they&amp;#39;re the ones who sponsored</text>
  <text start="884.98" dur="6.57">the terrorism and the wars throughout</text>
  <text start="887.47" dur="7.169">the Middle East we have to remember they</text>
  <text start="891.55" dur="8.039">had all the refugees funnel into Turkey</text>
  <text start="894.639" dur="9.45">and there was a build-up year after year</text>
  <text start="899.589" dur="6.87">after year and then they were told in</text>
  <text start="904.089" dur="5.131">Turkey that if we let you out through</text>

  <text start="911.649" dur="8.28">they let them loose across Europe and</text>
  <text start="914.97" dur="6.729">then Obama stepped in and said okay let</text>
  <text start="919.929" dur="4.71">the United States help this is what he</text>
  <text start="921.699" dur="7.531">needed because the illegals coming over</text>
  <text start="924.639" dur="8.67">the border wasn&amp;#39;t enough so they need</text>
  <text start="929.23" dur="8.459">more in here and the second agenda for</text>
  <text start="933.309" dur="7.38">all of this is basically trying to</text>
  <text start="937.689" dur="7.231">create chaos and pit people against each</text>
  <text start="940.689" dur="6.291">other because once they have everyone</text>
  <text start="944.92" dur="4.529">fighting and getting fed up with this</text>
  <text start="946.98" dur="5.38">they will ask them to join them in the</text>
  <text start="949.449" dur="5.64">war to stop all of this but it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="952.36" dur="6.419">hard because they&amp;#39;re the cause of it now</text>
  <text start="955.089" dur="5.37">out in Syria Assad is out there saying</text>
  <text start="958.779" dur="4.141">that everything that is being done</text>
  <text start="960.459" dur="5.371">inside his country they are coordinating</text>

  <text start="965.83" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;re not coordinating with the United</text>
  <text start="968.41" dur="7.08">States with the UK with France or anyone</text>
  <text start="972.49" dur="7.56">else again we have to remember Russia</text>
  <text start="975.49" dur="7.62">was invited into Syria the United States</text>
  <text start="980.05" dur="6.81">invaded Syria the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="983.11" dur="8.07">invaded Syria Syria is a sovereign</text>
  <text start="986.86" dur="7.35">country and they did this for one reason</text>
  <text start="991.18" dur="5.31">and one reason only to get Assad but the</text>
  <text start="994.21" dur="5.76">White House right now is losing their</text>
  <text start="996.49" dur="6.18">initiative in Syria things are falling</text>
  <text start="999.97" dur="7.26">apart rapidly and we&amp;#39;re getting reports</text>
  <text start="1002.67" dur="6.75">that Obama has been blocking 75% of the</text>
  <text start="1007.23" dur="5.91">Islamic strikes remember in the</text>
  <text start="1009.42" dur="7.38">beginning of all this he was the one who</text>
  <text start="1013.14" dur="5.67">wanted to pick out the targets because</text>
  <text start="1016.8" dur="5.76">he was getting instructions of where the</text>
  <text start="1018.81" dur="5.37">Islamic state was and where to hit so</text>
  <text start="1022.56" dur="6.12">they wouldn&amp;#39;t hurt their proxy armies</text>
  <text start="1024.18" dur="7.2">and we know from one of the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="1028.68" dur="5.909">sources who was working out in the field</text>
  <text start="1031.38" dur="4.47">this is absolutely true now of course</text>
  <text start="1034.589" dur="3.151">they&amp;#39;re saying well we didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1035.85" dur="6.33">hurt civilians we were trying to avoid</text>
  <text start="1037.74" dur="7.5">civilians come on that didn&amp;#39;t work in</text>
  <text start="1042.18" dur="5.909">Afghanistan and they knew civilians were</text>
  <text start="1045.24" dur="6.42">there we know they gave their proxy army</text>
  <text start="1048.089" dur="6.421">sarin gas to use on the civilians made</text>
  <text start="1051.66" dur="6.24">no difference we know the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1054.51" dur="6.86">was using chlorine gas made no</text>
  <text start="1057.9" dur="6.03">difference so that story doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="1061.37" dur="5.2">now the u.s. is pushing this peace</text>
  <text start="1063.93" dur="4.32">process really really hard they want</text>
  <text start="1066.57" dur="4.68">peace in Syria it reminds me of the</text>
  <text start="1068.25" dur="6.87">Geneva 1 Geneva 2 talks when they had</text>
  <text start="1071.25" dur="7.26">the Free Syrian Army the opposition</text>
  <text start="1075.12" dur="6.27">group meet with Assads representatives</text>
  <text start="1078.51" dur="5.22">in Geneva to talk about him stepping</text>
  <text start="1081.39" dur="4.98">down and that was the only thing that</text>
  <text start="1083.73" dur="4.68">was on their agenda and the u.s. right</text>
  <text start="1086.37" dur="5.31">now is pushing the same exact agenda I</text>
  <text start="1088.41" dur="5.37">mean they were top diplomats from 17</text>
  <text start="1091.68" dur="3.48">different countries and they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="1093.78" dur="3.69">about a new framework about a new</text>
  <text start="1095.16" dur="4.05">constitution holding elections and of</text>
  <text start="1097.47" dur="4.65">course Assad said listen</text>
  <text start="1099.21" dur="4.41">yes we will do all this as soon as we</text>
  <text start="1102.12" dur="4.83">get rid of all the terrorism out of my</text>
  <text start="1103.62" dur="5.4">country but of course United States is</text>
  <text start="1106.95" dur="3.81">saying that yes we&amp;#39;re getting ready for</text>
  <text start="1109.02" dur="7.529">a transitional government we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1110.76" dur="7.61">ready to remove Assad and right now we</text>
  <text start="1116.549" dur="5.341">can see that this isn&amp;#39;t going to happen</text>
  <text start="1118.37" dur="5.35">Assad is not going to step down Russia</text>
  <text start="1121.89" dur="4.259">is not going to force Assad to be</text>
  <text start="1123.72" dur="5.4">removed they&amp;#39;ve already set a time and</text>
  <text start="1126.149" dur="5.671">time again it is that people&amp;#39;s choice</text>
  <text start="1129.12" dur="5.429">and the United States is not going to</text>
  <text start="1131.82" dur="4.94">like this the United States is then</text>
  <text start="1134.549" dur="7.081">going to move to the next phase and that</text>
  <text start="1136.76" dur="8.95">is bringing more false flags to our</text>
  <text start="1141.63" dur="7.649">doorstep to push everyone into going</text>
  <text start="1145.71" dur="5.52">into this war now it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1149.279" dur="5.37">about the last false flag which just</text>
  <text start="1151.23" dur="5.22">happened on Friday the 13th there are</text>
  <text start="1154.649" dur="6.831">details coming out but about the two</text>
  <text start="1156.45" dur="9.03">suspects that supposedly were the</text>
  <text start="1161.48" dur="6.52">masterminds and the assassins the</text>
  <text start="1165.48" dur="5.28">terrorists and they keep saying that</text>
  <text start="1168" dur="5.899">they&amp;#39;re Muslim their radical Islamists</text>
  <text start="1170.76" dur="7.279">and then we come to find out that the</text>
  <text start="1173.899" dur="8.351">Abdeslam brothers ran a bar in Belgium</text>
  <text start="1178.039" dur="7.601">use lots of drugs drank alcohol which is</text>
  <text start="1182.25" dur="6.809">completely forbidden in Islam basically</text>
  <text start="1185.64" dur="6.87">they didn&amp;#39;t attend any of the mosques</text>
  <text start="1189.059" dur="6.691">and they didn&amp;#39;t really believe in the</text>
  <text start="1192.51" dur="4.98">Islamic principles so what the corporate</text>
  <text start="1195.75" dur="4.409">media is telling us is completely</text>
  <text start="1197.49" dur="7.35">opposite from what the ex-wife is saying</text>
  <text start="1200.159" dur="7.351">and people who knew these people so</text>
  <text start="1204.84" dur="6.059">what&amp;#39;s going on here we have two</text>
  <text start="1207.51" dur="4.98">different stories right now and the</text>
  <text start="1210.899" dur="3.961">government story you can tell is</text>
  <text start="1212.49" dur="5.64">complete propaganda because we saw from</text>
  <text start="1214.86" dur="7.1">the CCTV video the person doing the</text>
  <text start="1218.13" dur="7.71">shooting looked white clean shaven and</text>
  <text start="1221.96" dur="6.13">did not look like an Islamic radical</text>
  <text start="1225.84" dur="4.53">person and then we come to find out that</text>
  <text start="1228.09" dur="4.5">hossain Mortada a Lebanese journalist</text>
  <text start="1230.37" dur="3.12">and director of information centers for</text>
  <text start="1232.59" dur="4.5">studies and document</text>
  <text start="1233.49" dur="5.31">station reported the following he</text>
  <text start="1237.09" dur="3.21">provided details about one of the</text>
  <text start="1238.8" dur="7.259">individuals who carried out the Paris</text>
  <text start="1240.3" dur="12.36">attack on the 13th and his name was a</text>
  <text start="1246.059" dur="12.111">Bota hala al Jazeera and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1252.66" dur="8.79">that these people were French nationals</text>
  <text start="1258.17" dur="8.08">they&amp;#39;ve been trained in the occupied</text>
  <text start="1261.45" dur="8.67">Golan Heights along with his crew who</text>
  <text start="1266.25" dur="9.059">carried out the Paris attack he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="1270.12" dur="7.77">that they were trained by Mossad then</text>
  <text start="1275.309" dur="7.111">they were sent to France six months</text>
  <text start="1277.89" dur="7.86">before the Paris attack to basically be</text>
  <text start="1282.42" dur="7.5">the patsies for this entire false flag</text>
  <text start="1285.75" dur="7.89">event and you have to ask yourself a</text>
  <text start="1289.92" dur="5.16">question we know that friend the France</text>
  <text start="1293.64" dur="4.89">had security all over the place</text>
  <text start="1295.08" dur="8.4">especially in stadiums concert halls how</text>
  <text start="1298.53" dur="7.19">did these people get inside dress the</text>
  <text start="1303.48" dur="7.07">way they said they were dressed in black</text>
  <text start="1305.72" dur="9.37">with suicide vests on wires hanging down</text>
  <text start="1310.55" dur="8.2">ak-47s they needed some help from the</text>
  <text start="1315.09" dur="7.74">inside and we know the bat a clan was</text>
  <text start="1318.75" dur="6.27">recently sold and we know this was used</text>
  <text start="1322.83" dur="4.29">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about about</text>
  <text start="1325.02" dur="4.56">a clan is that there was a concert going</text>
  <text start="1327.12" dur="4.35">on in there and we know when you go to a</text>
  <text start="1329.58" dur="4.14">concert you like to bring your phone you</text>
  <text start="1331.47" dur="4.62">like to take pictures you like to have</text>
  <text start="1333.72" dur="6.18">many many different shots inside the</text>
  <text start="1336.09" dur="6.96">Vatican and we&amp;#39;re not seeing that much</text>
  <text start="1339.9" dur="5.34">come out of there which I find very very</text>
  <text start="1343.05" dur="4.86">interesting because normally we see tons</text>
  <text start="1345.24" dur="5.37">and tons of pictures during the concert</text>
  <text start="1347.91" dur="7.11">during what happened and we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="1350.61" dur="7.37">very little bit trickle in now we see</text>
  <text start="1355.02" dur="5.76">the Islamic state is continually pushing</text>
  <text start="1357.98" dur="4.89">terror which we know it&amp;#39;s not really</text>
  <text start="1360.78" dur="4.529">coming from the Islamic state and</text>
  <text start="1362.87" dur="4.55">they&amp;#39;re looking to blow up the White</text>
  <text start="1365.309" dur="2.981">House right now</text>
  <text start="1367.42" dur="5.19">and they&amp;#39;re going to say they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1368.29" dur="5.76">to turn the white house black and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1372.61" dur="4.65">very interesting about this is that</text>
  <text start="1374.05" dur="5.88">we&amp;#39;ve seen two movies about the white</text>
  <text start="1377.26" dur="4.76">house being attacked and I know the</text>
  <text start="1379.93" dur="4.83">Islamic state mentioned this once before</text>
  <text start="1382.02" dur="6.6">but what is happening at this point is</text>
  <text start="1384.76" dur="7.23">they need to make sure that everyone is</text>
  <text start="1388.62" dur="5.52">on the same page here that there is a</text>
  <text start="1391.99" dur="5.85">terrorist attack that&amp;#39;s going to occur</text>
  <text start="1394.14" dur="7.53">that it&amp;#39;s going to happen in multiple</text>
  <text start="1397.84" dur="6.09">places and from Europe as we know</text>
  <text start="1401.67" dur="5.32">they&amp;#39;re saying that since the Paris</text>
  <text start="1403.93" dur="6.21">attacks this might hurt the European</text>
  <text start="1406.99" dur="4.86">economy of course it&amp;#39;s going to because</text>
  <text start="1410.14" dur="5.19">this is what they&amp;#39;re using the cover up</text>
  <text start="1411.85" dur="6.93">the entire thing and here in the United</text>
  <text start="1415.33" dur="5.34">States this will be the last attack most</text>
  <text start="1418.78" dur="3.84">likely here in the United States there</text>
  <text start="1420.67" dur="6.47">might be other attacks throughout Europe</text>
  <text start="1422.62" dur="7.95">like we&amp;#39;re seeing to keep the fear going</text>
  <text start="1427.14" dur="6.94">but I&amp;#39;m thinking most likely they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1430.57" dur="5.13">have another one in Europe and then</text>
  <text start="1434.08" dur="4.98">bring it home here to the United States</text>
  <text start="1435.7" dur="7.32">to finish it off because we saw this</text>
  <text start="1439.06" dur="6.24">during World War Two United States was</text>
  <text start="1443.02" dur="6.81">pretty much the last country to enter</text>
  <text start="1445.3" dur="5.58">the war and they kept on saying you know</text>
  <text start="1449.83" dur="2.76">we&amp;#39;re not going to be going to war we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1450.88" dur="5.13">not going to be going to war and then we</text>
  <text start="1452.59" dur="5.4">had an attack and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1456.01" dur="5.33">doing the same exact thing again getting</text>
  <text start="1457.99" dur="5.67">Europe all together having them fight</text>
  <text start="1461.34" dur="4.98">hopefully they can start a war against</text>
  <text start="1463.66" dur="7.05">their fictional enemies of Russia China</text>
  <text start="1466.32" dur="7.39">North Korea Iran Syria and then</text>
  <text start="1470.71" dur="6.12">eventually if the United States the</text>
