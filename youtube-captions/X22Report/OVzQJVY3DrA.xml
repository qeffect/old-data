  <text start="104.039" dur="4.981">we are seeing more and more articles of</text>
  <text start="106.56" dur="4.379">talking about independence how you need</text>
  <text start="109.02" dur="3.419">to leave the central bank alone you</text>
  <text start="110.939" dur="4.38">shouldn&amp;#39;t be touching the central bank</text>
  <text start="112.439" dur="6.06">and then also we&amp;#39;re starting to hear</text>
  <text start="115.319" dur="6.421">that Congress might have lost control of</text>
  <text start="118.499" dur="6.36">the central bank where the Fed right now</text>
  <text start="121.74" dur="7.17">is not following their mandate and</text>
  <text start="124.859" dur="5.551">Congress is not holding the central bank</text>
  <text start="128.91" dur="3.81">to their mandate and we&amp;#39;ll be talking</text>
  <text start="130.41" dur="4.71">about that in just a minute but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="132.72" dur="3.989">head out to the UK because it seems like</text>
  <text start="135.12" dur="4.62">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="136.709" dur="5.881">how the EU how Teresa May how the</text>
  <text start="139.74" dur="7.2">certain government officials how they</text>
  <text start="142.59" dur="7.83">want to postpone the inevitable the UK</text>
  <text start="146.94" dur="5.36">breaking away from the EU the people</text>
  <text start="150.42" dur="5.46">voted they had a referendum and the</text>
  <text start="152.3" dur="6.82">government the EU they&amp;#39;re not following</text>
  <text start="155.88" dur="5.1">what the people want and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="159.12" dur="5.58">and this is really not a surprise to all</text>
  <text start="160.98" dur="5.7">of us Prime Minister Theresa May</text>
  <text start="164.7" dur="4.64">is considering amending her withdrawal</text>
  <text start="166.68" dur="6.08">agreement to include a commons vote on</text>
  <text start="169.34" dur="7.899">authorizing a second confirmation</text>
  <text start="172.76" dur="7.75">another referendum I mean this is just</text>
  <text start="177.239" dur="5.431">unbelievable and we talked about this</text>
  <text start="180.51" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re gonna do everything they</text>
  <text start="182.67" dur="5.25">possibly can to stop as they do not want</text>
  <text start="185.19" dur="6.48">this to happen and I think it&amp;#39;s time for</text>
  <text start="187.92" dur="6.63">the people to speak out loudly and to</text>
  <text start="191.67" dur="6.149">say enough is enough we need to break</text>
  <text start="194.55" dur="5.76">away hopefully that happens there are</text>
  <text start="197.819" dur="4.771">people that are out there saying yeah</text>
  <text start="200.31" dur="5.04">enough is enough and we can see that</text>
  <text start="202.59" dur="5.28">those in government those in the Central</text>
  <text start="205.35" dur="6.03">Bank those that are in league with the</text>
  <text start="207.87" dur="5.61">central bank they don&amp;#39;t want this to</text>
  <text start="211.38" dur="3.72">happen they&amp;#39;re trying to stop it any way</text>
  <text start="213.48" dur="4.56">they possibly can because you have to</text>
  <text start="215.1" dur="5.66">remember their biggest fear is to have a</text>
  <text start="218.04" dur="6.75">country leave and the country to prosper</text>
  <text start="220.76" dur="7.33">so if the UK separates itself from the</text>
  <text start="224.79" dur="5.28">EU and they prosper how do you think</text>
  <text start="228.09" dur="5.1">other countries are going to look at the</text>
  <text start="230.07" dur="4.83">EU well the EU countries are doing</text>
  <text start="233.19" dur="4.2">poorly the UK left and they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="234.9" dur="5.16">really really well maybe we should leave</text>
  <text start="237.39" dur="5.7">and you have to remember what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="240.06" dur="6.959">around the world people are now</text>
  <text start="243.09" dur="5.07">questioning the central bank people are</text>
  <text start="247.019" dur="2.97">saying wait a minute</text>
  <text start="248.16" dur="5.639">the global system the central bank</text>
  <text start="249.989" dur="6.601">system might not be what we need because</text>
  <text start="253.799" dur="7.851">it is not helping us we spent many many</text>
  <text start="256.59" dur="8.73">years and all we&amp;#39;ve seen is austerity</text>
  <text start="261.65" dur="6.61">we&amp;#39;ve seen debt and we haven&amp;#39;t seen</text>
  <text start="265.32" dur="5.55">anything improve yes the elite they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="268.26" dur="5.46">gotten richer but everyone else they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="270.87" dur="4.68">struggling and Trump here in the United</text>
  <text start="273.72" dur="3.3">States he&amp;#39;s trying to put the United</text>
  <text start="275.55" dur="3.869">States on an even playing field because</text>
  <text start="277.02" dur="5.25">he knows we&amp;#39;re gonna be moving away from</text>
  <text start="279.419" dur="4.881">the Federal Reserve debt note which is</text>
  <text start="282.27" dur="4.649">the reserve currency of the world and</text>
  <text start="284.3" dur="7">what he needs to do is he needs to set</text>
  <text start="286.919" dur="6.361">up fair and balanced trade systems this</text>
  <text start="291.3" dur="4.59">is why he&amp;#39;s making bad bilateral trade</text>
  <text start="293.28" dur="3.81">deals all across the globe and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="295.89" dur="2.309">going to continue to do this and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="297.09" dur="4.199">going to use tariffs</text>
  <text start="298.199" dur="4.951">to leverage this and no tariffs are not</text>
  <text start="301.289" dur="3.21">going to bring down the global economy</text>
  <text start="303.15" dur="3.239">I&amp;#39;m sorry the global economy was doomed</text>
  <text start="304.499" dur="4.591">from the beginning once the central bank</text>
  <text start="306.389" dur="5.49">took over because the weight of debt on</text>
  <text start="309.09" dur="6.449">the entire system it cannot be sustained</text>
  <text start="311.879" dur="5.79">and their system was declining way</text>
  <text start="315.539" dur="3.571">before Trump they just thought they were</text>
  <text start="317.669" dur="3.661">going to have an event to cover it all</text>
  <text start="319.11" dur="5.88">up now they&amp;#39;re exposed they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="321.33" dur="5.85">what to do so what is Trump doing Trump</text>

  <text start="337.74" dur="5.789">to Airbus has adversely impacted the</text>
  <text start="340.379" dur="7.35">United States which will now put tariffs</text>
  <text start="343.529" dur="6.181">on 11 billion of EU products the EU has</text>
  <text start="347.729" dur="5.581">taken advantage of the u.s. on trade for</text>
  <text start="349.71" dur="6.419">many years it will soon stop so what&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="360.419" dur="5.37">bankers were setting up over these past</text>
  <text start="362.849" dur="5.701">many many years remember their plan was</text>
  <text start="365.789" dur="6.03">to have a globalist system their plan</text>
  <text start="368.55" dur="6.419">was to have a one-world currency now</text>
  <text start="371.819" dur="5.33">Trump is chopping all that up and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="374.969" dur="6.18">creating bilateral trade agreements</text>
  <text start="377.149" dur="6.161">using tariffs to leverage these trade</text>
  <text start="381.149" dur="3.181">deals because you know the central</text>
  <text start="383.31" dur="3.479">bankers they&amp;#39;re just not going to give</text>
  <text start="384.33" dur="4.619">in if you say hey the trade deal it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="390.539" dur="6.78">is what we have so Trump needs to use</text>
  <text start="393.749" dur="6.271">tariffs to force the globalists to force</text>
  <text start="397.319" dur="5.551">the central bank into doing what he</text>
  <text start="400.02" dur="5.879">wants and moving us away from this</text>
  <text start="402.87" dur="4.59">global system now the IMF is out there</text>
  <text start="405.899" dur="3.6">and they slashed their world growth</text>
  <text start="407.46" dur="3.81">outlook to the weakest in decades and</text>
  <text start="409.499" dur="6.121">they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s because of the</text>
  <text start="411.27" dur="8.959">tariffs the thing is is that by the time</text>
  <text start="415.62" dur="9.09">this system comes down all these tariffs</text>
  <text start="420.229" dur="7.3">they won&amp;#39;t be there anymore Trump would</text>
  <text start="424.71" dur="7.17">have already negotiated a new deal with</text>
  <text start="427.529" dur="8.341">China with the EU if the EU still exists</text>
  <text start="431.88" dur="7.67">and there won&amp;#39;t be tariffs to blame this</text>
  <text start="435.87" dur="8.36">entire implosion of the economic system</text>
  <text start="439.55" dur="8.35">the blame will be at the central bank</text>
  <text start="444.23" dur="5.92">they already have this planned they know</text>
  <text start="447.9" dur="5.07">that they were trying to bring down the</text>
  <text start="450.15" dur="4.14">economic system before 2020 when I say</text>
  <text start="452.97" dur="4.17">they I am talking about the Patriots</text>
  <text start="454.29" dur="4.62">they already knew they were going to try</text>
  <text start="457.14" dur="4.95">to raise interest rates look what has</text>
  <text start="458.91" dur="6.44">happened since cue made that post no</text>
  <text start="462.09" dur="7.5">interest rate hikes in 2019 they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="465.35" dur="6.9">ending the tightening of their balance</text>
  <text start="469.59" dur="6.99">sheet the central bank&amp;#39;s balance sheet</text>
  <text start="472.25" dur="6.52">now Trump and the Patriots they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="476.58" dur="6.15">close to making a deal with China and</text>
  <text start="478.77" dur="7.26">now he&amp;#39;s pushing the EU to make a better</text>
  <text start="482.73" dur="6.54">trade deal with the United States so if</text>
  <text start="486.03" dur="4.77">the Patriots knew about the central bank</text>
  <text start="489.27" dur="4.17">raising the rates trying to bring down</text>
  <text start="490.8" dur="4.47">the economy in 2020 don&amp;#39;t you think they</text>
  <text start="493.44" dur="4.77">realized that they&amp;#39;re gonna try to blame</text>
  <text start="495.27" dur="5.16">it on the tariffs of course they do but</text>
  <text start="498.21" dur="4.47">they know they need to use the tariffs</text>
  <text start="500.43" dur="4.2">for leverage and what&amp;#39;s eventually going</text>
  <text start="502.68" dur="3.78">to happen is they&amp;#39;re going to make these</text>
  <text start="504.63" dur="3.42">deals and they&amp;#39;re going to get rid of</text>
  <text start="506.46" dur="2.64">the tariffs yes as soon as the deal is</text>
  <text start="508.05" dur="2.37">made they&amp;#39;re not just gonna get rid of</text>
  <text start="509.1" dur="3.749">it they want to make sure that these</text>
  <text start="510.42" dur="5.66">countries comply once they are complying</text>
  <text start="512.849" dur="6.721">the tariffs will then be removed and</text>
  <text start="516.08" dur="7.77">what do the central banks do at that</text>
  <text start="519.57" dur="7.11">point they&amp;#39;re stuck now we know that</text>
  <text start="523.85" dur="4.69">Trump and the Patriots there will be</text>
  <text start="526.68" dur="2.97">going after the Federal Reserve the</text>
  <text start="528.54" dur="2.31">Federal Reserve is completely out of</text>
  <text start="529.65" dur="3.66">control they&amp;#39;ve been out of control for</text>
  <text start="530.85" dur="5.01">a very long time and they&amp;#39;re acting in</text>
  <text start="533.31" dur="6.06">ways and with powers that were never</text>
  <text start="535.86" dur="5.49">explicitly granted by Congress now of</text>
  <text start="539.37" dur="4.22">course we&amp;#39;re not allowed to audit the</text>
  <text start="541.35" dur="4.38">Fed to see what else they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="543.59" dur="5.5">because we know they&amp;#39;ve been doing quite</text>
  <text start="545.73" dur="6">a bit and there&amp;#39;s a reason why they</text>
  <text start="549.09" dur="5.28">don&amp;#39;t want us to audit them because we</text>
  <text start="551.73" dur="5.61">would find out what they were doing but</text>
  <text start="554.37" dur="6.12">Trump already started everything in</text>
  <text start="557.34" dur="7.3">motion because he&amp;#39;s suggesting that</text>
  <text start="560.49" dur="9.9">Herman Cain and Stephen Moore</text>
  <text start="564.64" dur="11.46">be put on the Federal Reserve Board and</text>
  <text start="570.39" dur="9.61">the bankers the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="576.1" dur="7.32">elite they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen</text>
  <text start="580" dur="5.88">cane represents a threat to the Cabal</text>
  <text start="583.42" dur="5.58">that has controlled the central bank for</text>
  <text start="585.88" dur="6.12">decades media outlets and other allied</text>
  <text start="589" dur="6.71">constituencies have howled with rage at</text>
  <text start="592" dur="6.3">the prospect of Trump packing the Fed</text>
  <text start="595.71" dur="3.79">while the Fed is meant to be independent</text>
  <text start="598.3" dur="3.36">from the executive branch on a</text>
  <text start="599.5" dur="5.73">day-to-day basis it is certainly not</text>
  <text start="601.66" dur="6.99">independent of Congress or the law yet</text>
  <text start="605.23" dur="6">the Fed in recent years has shown a</text>
  <text start="608.65" dur="4.26">troubling tendency to deviate from its</text>
  <text start="611.23" dur="3.87">legal mandate and make up new</text>
  <text start="612.91" dur="6.75">authorities to fit the changing economic</text>
  <text start="615.1" dur="7.8">situation here&amp;#39;s an example this notion</text>
  <text start="619.66" dur="6.03">that we should be seeking 2% rate of</text>
  <text start="622.9" dur="6.08">inflation well this was in part of their</text>
  <text start="625.69" dur="6.3">mandate their mandate was no inflation</text>
  <text start="628.98" dur="4.93">so anybody who cares to read the 1978</text>
  <text start="631.99" dur="5.13">humphrey-hawkins law will know that the</text>
  <text start="633.91" dur="7.29">Fed is directed by Congress to seek full</text>
  <text start="637.12" dur="5.67">employment and zero inflation not two</text>
  <text start="641.2" dur="5.7">percent not three percent not nine</text>
  <text start="642.79" dur="4.59">percent but zero yet going back a decade</text>
  <text start="646.9" dur="3.93">or more</text>
  <text start="647.38" dur="6.27">the Fed led by Janet Yellen Ben Bernanke</text>
  <text start="650.83" dur="5.07">and the rest they have advanced their</text>
  <text start="653.65" dur="4.2">policies of actively embracing inflation</text>
  <text start="655.9" dur="4.17">and either Bernanke</text>
  <text start="657.85" dur="4.47">Yellen or any of these individuals</text>
  <text start="660.07" dur="3.96">bothered to consult Congress when they</text>
  <text start="662.32" dur="5.28">decided to discard their legal</text>
  <text start="664.03" dur="7.49">responsibilities my question is where is</text>
  <text start="667.6" dur="7.2">Congress why haven&amp;#39;t they done anything</text>
  <text start="671.52" dur="6.61">shouldn&amp;#39;t they be on top of this well</text>
  <text start="674.8" dur="5.75">why would they be there corrupt we</text>
  <text start="678.13" dur="6.3">talked about this many times before</text>
  <text start="680.55" dur="5.92">those individuals in Congress why would</text>
