  <text start="164.78" dur="4.29">out the window</text>
  <text start="165.67" dur="4.75">panic has set in we&amp;#39;ll be talking about</text>
  <text start="169.07" dur="3.12">this a little bit later in this report</text>
  <text start="170.42" dur="4.47">but first yesterday we talked about how</text>
  <text start="172.19" dur="4.92">Hillary Clinton is preparing to run once</text>
  <text start="174.89" dur="3.18">Trump is heard enough and he&amp;#39;s brought</text>
  <text start="177.11" dur="3.9">down in the polls</text>
  <text start="178.07" dur="5.13">or he&amp;#39;s impeached that is their plan</text>
  <text start="181.01" dur="3.93">that&amp;#39;s when she&amp;#39;ll make the announcement</text>
  <text start="183.2" dur="5.4">she&amp;#39;s trying to get the big tech</text>
  <text start="184.94" dur="5.16">companies on board so far Twitter is on</text>
  <text start="188.6" dur="3.87">board and we explained this yesterday</text>
  <text start="190.1" dur="6.359">she was trying to get facebook on board</text>
  <text start="192.47" dur="5.48">but for some reason right now and this</text>
  <text start="196.459" dur="5.28">doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s going to change</text>
  <text start="197.95" dur="6.43">Mark Zuckerberg gave an important</text>
  <text start="201.739" dur="6">address and defense of free speech in it</text>
  <text start="204.38" dur="6.03">he explained Facebook&amp;#39;s new policy that</text>
  <text start="207.739" dur="4.741">they would not censor political speech</text>
  <text start="210.41" dur="4.74">but would instead allow the marketplace</text>
  <text start="212.48" dur="6.03">of ideas the back-and-forth of political</text>
  <text start="215.15" dur="5.82">debate to resolve public policy disputes</text>
  <text start="218.51" dur="4.29">now once again we know that these</text>
  <text start="220.97" dur="4.11">individuals say one thing and they do</text>
  <text start="222.8" dur="3.99">another or they sat or they say</text>
  <text start="225.08" dur="4.89">something that sounds really good like</text>
  <text start="226.79" dur="4.77">Jack Dorsey the CEO of Twitter who says</text>
  <text start="229.97" dur="3.9">listen we&amp;#39;re not gonna allow either</text>
  <text start="231.56" dur="4.38">party to pay for political ads but we</text>
  <text start="233.87" dur="5.64">know that they ban they shadow ban now</text>
  <text start="235.94" dur="5.72">with Mark Zuckerberg Satanism it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="239.51" dur="4.67">mean that they won&amp;#39;t ban the other side</text>
  <text start="241.66" dur="6.93">we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this all plays out</text>
  <text start="244.18" dur="7.66">but very interestingly Nancy Pelosi and</text>
  <text start="248.59" dur="6.31">Adam Schiff and the rest of the Dems the</text>
  <text start="251.84" dur="6.63">deep state players they are digging</text>
  <text start="254.9" dur="5.94">their hole deeper and deeper now of</text>
  <text start="258.47" dur="3.81">course the mainstream media those people</text>
  <text start="260.84" dur="3.389">who believe that Trump is going to get</text>
  <text start="262.28" dur="2.79">impeached they believe they have the</text>
  <text start="264.229" dur="3.571">upper hand</text>
  <text start="265.07" dur="5.97">the Patriots they&amp;#39;re in full control</text>
  <text start="267.8" dur="6.54">they&amp;#39;re allowing them to play this out</text>
  <text start="271.04" dur="7.17">they&amp;#39;re allowing them to expose what</text>
  <text start="274.34" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re trying to do Nancy Pelosi and</text>
  <text start="278.21" dur="4.95">those who voted for the impeachment</text>
  <text start="279.38" dur="8.01">resolution have just destroyed their</text>
  <text start="283.16" dur="6.54">party Nancy Pelosi is losing in the</text>
  <text start="287.39" dur="5.25">court of public opinion where the</text>
  <text start="289.7" dur="4.14">country is roughly split on support for</text>
  <text start="292.64" dur="3.63">impeachment</text>
  <text start="293.84" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s right all the dem smears have had</text>
  <text start="296.27" dur="4.649">practically no impact perhaps because</text>
  <text start="299.06" dur="4.32">the White House immediately moved to</text>
  <text start="300.919" dur="4.831">release the rough transcript allowing</text>
  <text start="303.38" dur="5.46">the public to see with its own eyes that</text>
  <text start="305.75" dur="5.16">there was no quid pro quo now think</text>
  <text start="308.84" dur="3.78">about what they&amp;#39;re saying think about</text>
  <text start="310.91" dur="2.91">what Pelosi and all these witnesses are</text>
  <text start="312.62" dur="3.87">saying oh my god when I heard the phone</text>
  <text start="313.82" dur="4.53">call I was just taken back hi III</text>
  <text start="316.49" dur="2.97">couldn&amp;#39;t even believe it but then</text>
  <text start="318.35" dur="3.72">everyone goes okay Reid the phone</text>
  <text start="319.46" dur="4.47">transcript what are you talking about</text>
  <text start="322.07" dur="3.9">because here&amp;#39;s the phone trip transcript</text>
  <text start="323.93" dur="5.67">it doesn&amp;#39;t resemble anything that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="325.97" dur="6">saying please explain and what evidence</text>
  <text start="329.6" dur="4.05">do you have of anything nothing this is</text>
  <text start="331.97" dur="5.79">their personal opinion which is</text>
  <text start="333.65" dur="6.66">meaningless now in a few weeks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="337.76" dur="3">going to have public hearings yeah of</text>
  <text start="340.31" dur="3.39">course</text>
  <text start="340.76" dur="5.28">this is what they&amp;#39;re calling them public</text>
  <text start="343.7" dur="5.67">hearings it&amp;#39;s going to be transparent</text>
  <text start="346.04" dur="5.55">and everyone&amp;#39;s going to see how this is</text>
  <text start="349.37" dur="4.4">all going to play out but we need to</text>
  <text start="351.59" dur="6.93">remember something very important here</text>
  <text start="353.77" dur="8.26">the reason why they had the resolution</text>
  <text start="358.52" dur="7.34">vote was to gain control of the public</text>
  <text start="362.03" dur="5.88">hearings remember Trump&amp;#39;s legal team</text>
  <text start="365.86" dur="6.1">they&amp;#39;re really not going to be able to</text>
  <text start="367.91" dur="7.43">participate they&amp;#39;re not going to be able</text>
  <text start="371.96" dur="6.99">to do the things they would normally do</text>
  <text start="375.34" dur="5.5">because they changed the rules and they</text>
  <text start="378.95" dur="4.23">did this on purpose we&amp;#39;ll be discussing</text>
  <text start="380.84" dur="4.889">that in a little bit now with all this</text>
  <text start="383.18" dur="5.459">being said the main mission is to block</text>
  <text start="385.729" dur="5.041">the criminal investigation the IG FISA</text>
  <text start="388.639" dur="4.681">report D class the criminal</text>
  <text start="390.77" dur="4.86">investigations and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="393.32" dur="3.54">knock down Trump in the polls so the</text>
  <text start="395.63" dur="3.03">Dems have a fighting chance and if they</text>
  <text start="396.86" dur="4.49">can get him impeached that would be even</text>
  <text start="398.66" dur="7.14">better this is a dead end</text>
  <text start="401.35" dur="7.33">the Patriots hold all the cards they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="405.8" dur="4.5">allowing the deep state to play this</text>
  <text start="408.68" dur="5.37">whole thing out they want the American</text>
  <text start="410.3" dur="6.56">people to actually see what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="414.05" dur="6.69">doing because how do you expose someone</text>
  <text start="416.86" dur="6.61">it&amp;#39;s a lot easier for these individuals</text>
  <text start="420.74" dur="5.85">to expose themselves to the American</text>
  <text start="423.47" dur="4.169">people and this is what the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="426.59" dur="4.349">allowing</text>
  <text start="427.639" dur="7.111">them to do because they want everyone to</text>
  <text start="430.939" dur="6.211">see exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing so Nancy</text>
  <text start="434.75" dur="4.729">and Schiff had announced public hearings</text>
  <text start="437.15" dur="4.19">coming soon why did they announce this</text>
  <text start="439.479" dur="5.771">why now</text>
  <text start="441.34" dur="5.229">why were the other held in secret well</text>
  <text start="445.25" dur="3.509">they couldn&amp;#39;t have public hearings</text>
  <text start="446.569" dur="5.671">before the resolution because they would</text>
  <text start="448.759" dur="4.59">have failed they didn&amp;#39;t have control the</text>
  <text start="452.24" dur="4.639">world was watching</text>
  <text start="453.349" dur="4.741">so those hearings needed to be in secret</text>
  <text start="456.879" dur="5.981">remember</text>
  <text start="458.09" dur="8.37">Muller Cohen Lewandowski and the rest</text>
  <text start="462.86" dur="6.41">where they had those out in the public</text>
  <text start="466.46" dur="7.259">what happened to those those completely</text>
  <text start="469.27" dur="7.38">failed with this new resolution they now</text>
  <text start="473.719" dur="6.48">have control over the public hearings</text>
  <text start="476.65" dur="8.049">they have the final decision and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="480.199" dur="6.511">hoping with them in control these public</text>
  <text start="484.699" dur="5.09">hearings will go the way they want them</text>
  <text start="486.71" dur="5.519">to go but the public is going to realize</text>
  <text start="489.789" dur="4.571">that wait a minute is this whole thing</text>
  <text start="492.229" dur="6.141">scripted are these scripted answers and</text>
  <text start="494.36" dur="7.97">why can&amp;#39;t anyone else ask questions and</text>
  <text start="498.37" dur="6.759">why do they keep cutting off those</text>
  <text start="502.33" dur="8.259">questions that need to be answered</text>
  <text start="505.129" dur="9.32">just like Schiff cut off the question to</text>
  <text start="510.589" dur="7.11">VIN Minh who did you tell and chef</text>
  <text start="514.449" dur="7">interrupted the American people are</text>
  <text start="517.699" dur="6.661">going to realize what is happening this</text>
  <text start="521.449" dur="4.711">is going to be a big fail actually we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="524.36" dur="3.81">see how far they get with the public</text>
  <text start="526.16" dur="4.56">hearings because once the first one</text>
  <text start="528.17" dur="4.909">fails or maybe the second one they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="530.72" dur="4.38">gonna end it</text>
  <text start="533.079" dur="5.95">representative Doug Kahn&amp;#39;s tweeted out</text>
  <text start="535.1" dur="5.669">the following fact Pelosi&amp;#39;s inquiry is</text>

  <text start="1585.559" dur="6.291">there&amp;#39;s no way out for them they are in</text>
  <text start="1588.86" dur="6.51">trouble now we come to find out that</text>
  <text start="1591.85" dur="6.34">Lindsey Graham who is the Senate</text>
  <text start="1595.37" dur="6.57">Judiciary chair who&amp;#39;s supposed to be</text>
  <text start="1598.19" dur="8.25">doing investigations he&amp;#39;s going to give</text>
  <text start="1601.94" dur="6.989">up his chair in 2020 if the Republicans</text>
  <text start="1606.44" dur="5.489">win the Senate once again and Grassley</text>
  <text start="1608.929" dur="6.271">is going to take over now</text>
  <text start="1611.929" dur="4.261">once again why is in Graham doing</text>
  <text start="1615.2" dur="3.14">anything</text>
  <text start="1616.19" dur="7.04">Hugh has been telling us to trust Graham</text>
  <text start="1618.34" dur="9.04">Graham was asking many questions to</text>
  <text start="1623.23" dur="8.32">Cavanaugh talking about military</text>
  <text start="1627.38" dur="7.23">tribunals and I do believe that Graham</text>
  <text start="1631.55" dur="5.88">was placed there for a specific reason</text>
  <text start="1634.61" dur="6.45">and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this all plays</text>
  <text start="1637.43" dur="7.77">out now very interestingly Elizabeth</text>
  <text start="1641.06" dur="6.03">Warren she came out and she let everyone</text>

  <text start="1654.23" dur="7.2">trillion over ten years now the first</text>
  <text start="1658.49" dur="5.34">question is who&amp;#39;s paying for this well I</text>
  <text start="1661.43" dur="3.96">guess it&amp;#39;s the American people she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1663.83" dur="4.65">trying to tell everyone there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1665.39" dur="5.09">be no taxes associated with this really</text>

  <text start="1670.48" dur="6.79">mean are these people that&amp;#39;s stupid</text>
  <text start="1674.15" dur="5.79">can you imagine just coming out and say</text>
  <text start="1677.27" dur="4.62">everything is free so elect me and it</text>
  <text start="1679.94" dur="3.78">reminds me of the movie that Kingsman I</text>
  <text start="1681.89" dur="6.21">don&amp;#39;t know if you ever saw this where</text>
  <text start="1683.72" dur="6.87">this individual was giving away free</text>
  <text start="1688.1" dur="4.8">phone chips where your phone would be</text>

  <text start="1692.9" dur="8.55">everything but hidden within that chip</text>
  <text start="1696.79" dur="7.6">was a signal that made everyone turn on</text>
  <text start="1701.45" dur="7.47">each other so free doesn&amp;#39;t always mean</text>
  <text start="1704.39" dur="7.08">free and these people who continually</text>

  <text start="1717.88" dur="7.33">nothing is ever for free there&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="1722.06" dur="5.46">something else attached to it and I</text>
  <text start="1725.21" dur="5.04">think the American people today they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1727.52" dur="6">wising up to this because somebody</text>
  <text start="1730.25" dur="5.43">eventually has to pay I mean go back to</text>
  <text start="1733.52" dur="6.51">1913 when the central bank was first</text>
  <text start="1735.68" dur="6.96">created and remember as the government</text>
  <text start="1740.03" dur="5.52">continually borrowed these funds there</text>
  <text start="1742.64" dur="5.1">was interest attached and to pay for</text>
  <text start="1745.55" dur="4.08">this interest where was the money gonna</text>
  <text start="1747.74" dur="4.59">come from now in the beginning they said</text>
  <text start="1749.63" dur="5.79">no one&amp;#39;s going to be taxed and then they</text>
  <text start="1752.33" dur="5.61">said well you know we&amp;#39;re borrowing a lot</text>
  <text start="1755.42" dur="6.18">now and the interest is accumulating</text>
  <text start="1757.94" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;re just gonna tax the rich and of</text>
  <text start="1761.6" dur="2.85">course everyone in the middle class</text>

  <text start="1764.45" dur="4.65">and the poor all said that&amp;#39;s great the</text>
  <text start="1766.88" dur="6.42">rich they have the money they should be</text>
  <text start="1769.1" dur="7.08">taxed then what happen the government</text>
  <text start="1773.3" dur="6.15">continually borrowed and there was more</text>
  <text start="1776.18" dur="6.42">interest there was more debt and the</text>
  <text start="1779.45" dur="6.9">rich they were taxed but they needed</text>
  <text start="1782.6" dur="5.64">more to pay for what was happening so</text>
  <text start="1786.35" dur="3.57">they had a tax the middle upper middle</text>
  <text start="1788.24" dur="4.5">class then it came to the middle class</text>
