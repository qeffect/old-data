  <text start="183.68" dur="3.42">to see other stores close and we would</text>
  <text start="185.18" dur="4.29">predict we predicted this back</text>
  <text start="187.1" dur="3.57">last year during the holiday season when</text>
  <text start="189.47" dur="2.13">the corporate media was out there</text>
  <text start="190.67" dur="4.2">telling you that everything was going to</text>
  <text start="191.6" dur="4.95">be great how many stores closed down how</text>
  <text start="194.87" dur="3.78">many people lost their jobs how many</text>
  <text start="196.55" dur="4.26">people how many stores went bankrupt I</text>
  <text start="198.65" dur="4.41">mean it was a disaster this is why they</text>
  <text start="200.81" dur="4.74">called it the retail apocalypse what are</text>
  <text start="203.06" dur="6.48">they going to call this time it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="205.55" dur="5.55">to be a complete nightmare we see out in</text>
  <text start="209.54" dur="4.77">Spain Spain&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="211.1" dur="6.63">third biggest lender just launched a</text>
  <text start="214.31" dur="5.1">pilot project in Madrid what are they</text>
  <text start="217.73" dur="5.55">going to do well they&amp;#39;re going to limit</text>
  <text start="219.41" dur="7.23">cash services their branches are going</text>
  <text start="223.28" dur="7.14">to be open less than three hours a day</text>
  <text start="226.64" dur="6.36">from 8:15 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and they</text>
  <text start="230.42" dur="5.04">will allow people to do cash operations</text>
  <text start="233" dur="4.77">all other times you will not be able to</text>
  <text start="235.46" dur="4.98">do this now this is not the first bank</text>
  <text start="237.77" dur="5.79">in Spain that is trying out such a</text>
  <text start="240.44" dur="5.97">scheme but it is the biggest Spain&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="246.41" dur="4.41">owned bankia has removed all cash</text>
  <text start="249.08" dur="4.59">services from its elected branches now</text>
  <text start="250.82" dur="5.64">again what are they trying to do here</text>
  <text start="253.67" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re trying to stop a bank run when</text>
  <text start="256.46" dur="5.22">these banks completely implode this is</text>
  <text start="258.98" dur="6.48">why the central banks in Europe are</text>
  <text start="261.68" dur="6">trying to get rid of that safety net of</text>
  <text start="265.46" dur="3.9">where your where the deposits are</text>
  <text start="267.68" dur="4.02">insured they&amp;#39;re saying no we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="269.36" dur="3.27">to insure deposits anymore because what</text>
  <text start="271.7" dur="2.73">they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="272.63" dur="3.54">to keep all the funds in the bank they</text>
  <text start="274.43" dur="4.53">don&amp;#39;t want to have any type of bank runs</text>
  <text start="276.17" dur="5.07">whatsoever in getting rid of cash they</text>
  <text start="278.96" dur="5.1">believe in their mind this will stop it</text>
  <text start="281.24" dur="3.89">but we can see right now that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="284.06" dur="3.3">gonna have a very tough time</text>
  <text start="285.13" dur="3.76">implementing all of this yes they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="287.36" dur="4.77">gonna try they&amp;#39;re gonna push this</text>
  <text start="288.89" dur="5.79">forward and this tells us they already</text>
  <text start="292.13" dur="4.38">know that this system is dying now the</text>
  <text start="294.68" dur="4.58">central bankers they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="296.51" dur="5.19">manipulating gold for a very long time</text>
  <text start="299.26" dur="4.6">they&amp;#39;ve been keeping the gold price very</text>
  <text start="301.7" dur="4.17">low and at the same time and we talked</text>
  <text start="303.86" dur="4.71">about this before in other reports China</text>
  <text start="305.87" dur="4.26">and Russia they have been purchasing a</text>
  <text start="308.57" dur="3.27">huge amount of gold India has been</text>
  <text start="310.13" dur="3.09">purchasing a lot of gold a lot of the</text>
  <text start="311.84" dur="3.36">BRIC nations have been purchasing a lot</text>
  <text start="313.22" dur="4.259">of gold and again the corporate media</text>
  <text start="315.2" dur="3.66">and the rest of fed all the central</text>
  <text start="317.479" dur="3.001">banks are telling us and how we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="318.86" dur="3.33">need gold now we need</text>
  <text start="320.48" dur="3.6">go back to the Great Depression and</text>
  <text start="322.19" dur="4.77">think about what happened then when</text>
  <text start="324.08" dur="5.4">people owned gold and it was valued at</text>
  <text start="326.96" dur="5.01">$20 an ounce and all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="329.48" dur="4.14">government needed the gold and they gave</text>
  <text start="331.97" dur="5.3">you paper dollars for the gold and all</text>
  <text start="333.62" dur="7.56">of a sudden they revalued the gold at</text>
  <text start="337.27" dur="6.16">$35 an ounce now think about this the</text>
  <text start="341.18" dur="4.17">BRIC countries comprising of Brazil</text>
  <text start="343.43" dur="3.36">Russia India and China in South Africa</text>
  <text start="345.35" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re mulling right now the</text>
  <text start="346.79" dur="4.68">possibility of creating a unified system</text>
  <text start="348.62" dur="5.91">of gold trade both within BRICS and at</text>
  <text start="351.47" dur="4.68">the level of the bilateral contacts the</text>
  <text start="354.53" dur="3.6">tradition what they&amp;#39;re saying is the</text>
  <text start="356.15" dur="4.17">traditional trade system based in London</text>
  <text start="358.13" dur="6">and parsley and Swiss cities is becoming</text>
  <text start="360.32" dur="6.78">less relevant as new trade hubs are</text>
  <text start="364.13" dur="5.64">emerging first of all in India China and</text>
  <text start="367.1" dur="5.1">South Africa now according to the</text>
  <text start="369.77" dur="5.25">central bank official on the basis of</text>
  <text start="372.2" dur="8.25">this unified system it is possible to</text>
  <text start="375.02" dur="7.59">create new benchmarks in the future now</text>
  <text start="380.45" dur="4.05">the question is what is going on here</text>
  <text start="382.61" dur="5">well we know the Bank of Russia</text>
  <text start="384.5" dur="5.22">purchased around six million ounces</text>
  <text start="387.61" dur="4.3">which is almost a hundred eighty seven</text>
  <text start="389.72" dur="3.84">tons of gold within ten months in 2017</text>
  <text start="391.91" dur="5.19">and they&amp;#39;ve been purchasing a lot of</text>
  <text start="393.56" dur="6.42">gold in the past we know that China has</text>
  <text start="397.1" dur="4.56">been doing this doing the same thing we</text>
  <text start="399.98" dur="3.51">know that India has been purchasing gold</text>
  <text start="401.66" dur="3.69">they have a lot of gold and many other</text>
  <text start="403.49" dur="3.84">countries have been doing the same now</text>
  <text start="405.35" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;ve been buying the gold at a very</text>
  <text start="407.33" dur="6.27">very low price and they&amp;#39;ve been hoarding</text>
  <text start="411.08" dur="4.32">it now remember the central banks they</text>
  <text start="413.6" dur="3.6">don&amp;#39;t care where they set up shop they</text>
  <text start="415.4" dur="3.9">don&amp;#39;t care about a country they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="417.2" dur="4.65">care about people they only care about</text>
  <text start="419.3" dur="6.03">profit and their system their system of</text>
  <text start="421.85" dur="6.15">debt and to start a new system they need</text>
  <text start="425.33" dur="5.37">gold why do they need gold because they</text>
  <text start="428" dur="5.22">need everyone to believe that this is</text>
  <text start="430.7" dur="5.13">going to be based on a stable system and</text>
  <text start="433.22" dur="6.72">it&amp;#39;s backed by something of value which</text>
  <text start="435.83" dur="6.33">is gold and what the central bankers do</text>
  <text start="439.94" dur="4.26">and what they&amp;#39;ve been allowing the</text>
  <text start="442.16" dur="4.11">countries of China and Russia to do and</text>
  <text start="444.2" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re still kind of good well China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="446.27" dur="4.47">controlled by the central banks Russia</text>
  <text start="447.56" dur="4.89">Putin did take over their central bank</text>
  <text start="450.74" dur="3.54">but it&amp;#39;s all really part of the same</text>
  <text start="452.45" dur="4.14">system because it looks like</text>
  <text start="454.28" dur="6.27">the central banking system is setting up</text>
  <text start="456.59" dur="6.54">shop in China now they&amp;#39;ve been keeping</text>
  <text start="460.55" dur="4.86">the gold level very very low so China</text>
  <text start="463.13" dur="5.43">and Russia and the rest of the BRIC</text>
  <text start="465.41" dur="5.7">nations can continually purchase gold at</text>
  <text start="468.56" dur="4.2">this very low price when the SIS the new</text>
  <text start="471.11" dur="3.57">system comes online when we had go</text>
  <text start="472.76" dur="3.9">through this big reset they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="474.68" dur="4.23">do what they did back in the Great</text>
  <text start="476.66" dur="4.62">Depression they&amp;#39;re going to revalue the</text>
  <text start="478.91" dur="5.759">gold they&amp;#39;re going to revalue the gold</text>
  <text start="481.28" dur="5.639">much higher now if I remember correctly</text>
  <text start="484.669" dur="4.5">I discussed this with Louis cameras on</text>
  <text start="486.919" dur="4.021">Oh on one of our interviews where he</text>
  <text start="489.169" dur="4.471">said that China would not have enough</text>
  <text start="490.94" dur="5.01">gold unless they reevaluate it much much</text>
  <text start="493.64" dur="4.95">higher and then he could see the</text>
  <text start="495.95" dur="5.91">possibilities of gold being something</text>
  <text start="498.59" dur="5.94">that they can use to back the system and</text>
  <text start="501.86" dur="5.19">it looks like this is what they might be</text>
  <text start="504.53" dur="4.62">trying to do right now where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="507.05" dur="5.669">looking to create this whole new gold</text>
  <text start="509.15" dur="5.97">trading system benchmark gold completely</text>
  <text start="512.719" dur="3.721">different than it is today and the value</text>
  <text start="515.12" dur="3.03">of gold and we&amp;#39;ve been saying this for a</text>
  <text start="516.44" dur="4.5">very long time if we use the old</text>
  <text start="518.15" dur="4.62">calculation methods it is not fifteen</text>
  <text start="520.94" dur="4.41">hundred it is not twelve hundred it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="522.77" dur="4.68">not a thousand dollars an ounce it is</text>
  <text start="525.35" dur="5.27">much much higher more like seven eight</text>
  <text start="527.45" dur="8.16">nine maybe even higher than that and</text>
  <text start="530.62" dur="7.54">once they do this everything will change</text>
  <text start="535.61" dur="4.5">and those people holding gold just like</text>
  <text start="538.16" dur="3.39">back in the Great Depression where they</text>
  <text start="540.11" dur="3.87">were holding gold they decided you know</text>
  <text start="541.55" dur="4.11">I&amp;#39;m not gonna take the paper dollars I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="543.98" dur="4.2">gonna keep my gold I&amp;#39;m gonna hide it and</text>
  <text start="545.66" dur="6.929">say hey I don&amp;#39;t have any all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="548.18" dur="7.5">one day they had $20 an ounce and the</text>
  <text start="552.589" dur="5.191">next day they had $35 an ounce now can</text>
  <text start="555.68" dur="6.39">you imagine those people still holding</text>
  <text start="557.78" dur="8.19">gold where they had what 1,100 1,200</text>
  <text start="562.07" dur="5.97">1,500 1,900 whatever they purchased it</text>
  <text start="565.97" dur="4.92">at an ounce and all of a sudden now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="568.04" dur="6.15">worth 8 9 10 thousand dollars an ounce</text>
  <text start="570.89" dur="5.94">and you can see this is where we are</text>
  <text start="574.19" dur="4.5">moving into right now because they</text>
  <text start="576.83" dur="4.08">understand that the system is about to</text>
  <text start="578.69" dur="4.5">reset they understand that everything is</text>
  <text start="580.91" dur="4.14">in place now and this is not something</text>
  <text start="583.19" dur="3.57">that just happened yesterday they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="585.05" dur="2.18">been planning on this for a very long</text>
  <text start="586.76" dur="2.69">time</text>
  <text start="587.23" dur="4.41">is why they moved manufacturing out of</text>
  <text start="589.45" dur="4.68">the United States over to China and</text>
  <text start="591.64" dur="4.8">other Asian nations this is why they</text>
  <text start="594.13" dur="4.26">moved the trading system the swift</text>
  <text start="596.44" dur="3.87">payment system they duplicated all of</text>
  <text start="598.39" dur="4.29">this over in the other countries because</text>
  <text start="600.31" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;ve been preparing for this for a</text>
  <text start="602.68" dur="4.65">very long time now if they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="604.51" dur="4.47">preparing that what it means is you need</text>
  <text start="607.33" dur="3.6">to prepare and those people that have</text>
  <text start="608.98" dur="4.14">been buying silver those have been</text>
  <text start="610.93" dur="3.39">buying gold those been buying other</text>
  <text start="613.12" dur="5.1">precious metals</text>
  <text start="614.32" dur="6.27">maybe junk silver in the end you will</text>
  <text start="618.22" dur="3.51">protect your wealth think about all</text>
  <text start="620.59" dur="3.33">those people that purchase</text>
  <text start="621.73" dur="3.96">cryptocurrency when it was say Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="623.92" dur="3.93">or like coin or the others let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="625.69" dur="4.83">use Bitcoin that when it when it was at</text>
