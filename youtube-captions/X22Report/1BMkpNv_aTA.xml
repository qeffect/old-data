  <text start="263.46" dur="6.39">decide to merge with other stores</text>
  <text start="265.83" dur="7.62">because if the population was able to</text>

  <text start="320.449" dur="5.37">to all encrypted smartphones and</text>
  <text start="322.909" dur="5.13">communication devices so he&amp;#39;s saying</text>

  <text start="335.21" dur="6.9">any time well there&amp;#39;s other ways of</text>
  <text start="339.05" dur="6.29">doing it I mean they can have witness</text>
  <text start="342.11" dur="6.48">testimony they can use forensic science</text>
  <text start="345.34" dur="5.379">they can have undercover cops they can</text>
  <text start="348.59" dur="5.34">do all these different things to mount</text>
  <text start="350.719" dur="5.07">an investigation and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="353.93" dur="4.109">right now is they&amp;#39;re trying to make the</text>
  <text start="355.789" dur="4.171">case of why they need to spy on every</text>
  <text start="358.039" dur="4.651">single person think about this for a</text>
  <text start="359.96" dur="6.53">second what is their millions and</text>
  <text start="362.69" dur="6.56">millions of safes around the country</text>
  <text start="366.49" dur="6.7">does the government have the combination</text>
  <text start="369.25" dur="7.93">to each and every one of these no they</text>
  <text start="373.19" dur="5.909">don&amp;#39;t if they need to get to the</text>
  <text start="377.18" dur="6.09">information in any one of these safes</text>
  <text start="379.099" dur="7.951">what do they do they have tools to break</text>
  <text start="383.27" dur="5.22">into the safe well we know they&amp;#39;re tools</text>
  <text start="387.05" dur="5.16">out there that they can break into any</text>
  <text start="388.49" dur="8.25">one of these phones we seem from john</text>
  <text start="392.21" dur="7.679">mcafee and actually now more hardware</text>
  <text start="396.74" dur="5.39">and software technicians are coming out</text>
  <text start="399.889" dur="5.451">saying yes you can do this to any system</text>
  <text start="402.13" dur="7.24">all they need is the physical phone and</text>
  <text start="405.34" dur="6.579">they need tools where they can get into</text>
  <text start="409.37" dur="6.15">these systems just like they get into</text>
  <text start="411.919" dur="6.81">the computer systems so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="5.85">really telling us is no we just want to</text>
  <text start="418.729" dur="4.68">spy on you all the time we want to have</text>
  <text start="421.37" dur="6.59">access all the time what they really</text>
  <text start="423.409" dur="7.361">want is the back door or the combination</text>
  <text start="427.96" dur="5.9">to everyone&amp;#39;s safe</text>
  <text start="430.77" dur="7.41">that&amp;#39;s what they really want but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="433.86" dur="6.48">making this a really big deal to try to</text>
  <text start="438.18" dur="4.53">convince everyone they just don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="440.34" dur="7.5">the tools to do this and guess what they</text>
  <text start="442.71" dur="7.44">really do now North Korea it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="447.84" dur="4.41">reported now that there&amp;#39;s a sub that has</text>
  <text start="450.15" dur="5.009">gone missing we know that the u.s. and</text>
  <text start="452.25" dur="5.669">South Korea had the largest ever assault</text>
  <text start="455.159" dur="5.371">drill and they&amp;#39;re saying we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="457.919" dur="5.22">where this sub is it might have sank we</text>
  <text start="460.53" dur="4.59">don&amp;#39;t it could be sailing to the u.s. to</text>
  <text start="463.139" dur="4.291">attack now we&amp;#39;ll have to watch this</text>
  <text start="465.12" dur="4.38">situation very carefully because as we</text>
  <text start="467.43" dur="4.799">know the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="469.5" dur="4.68">are pushing for a war and we can expect</text>
  <text start="472.229" dur="4.951">a false flag now is this the false flag</text>
  <text start="474.18" dur="5.03">we don&amp;#39;t know most likely the sub will</text>
  <text start="477.18" dur="4.169">turn up but we need to keep an eye on</text>
  <text start="479.21" dur="3.699">what is really going on here and it</text>
  <text start="481.349" dur="4.47">seems like they&amp;#39;re using this propaganda</text>
  <text start="482.909" dur="4.56">to convince us that something could be</text>
  <text start="485.819" dur="5.371">happening and this could be a lead up to</text>
  <text start="487.469" dur="6.091">the major false flag now we see the u.s.</text>
  <text start="491.19" dur="3.84">is taking issue on Iran&amp;#39;s missile test</text>
  <text start="493.56" dur="4.199">they&amp;#39;re bringing it up to the UN</text>
  <text start="495.03" dur="4.889">Security Council and their missile</text>
  <text start="497.759" dur="4.891">systems have nothing to do with the p5</text>
  <text start="499.919" dur="4.891">plus one agreement whatsoever it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="502.65" dur="3.87">completely outside of the scope of</text>
  <text start="504.81" dur="3.78">course they&amp;#39;re trying to bringing in</text>
  <text start="506.52" dur="4.28">saying oh these missiles could carry</text>
  <text start="508.59" dur="5.34">nuclear weapons but we already have</text>
  <text start="510.8" dur="4.84">confirmation from the IAEA saying nope</text>
  <text start="513.93" dur="3.45">there are no nuclear weapons whatsoever</text>
  <text start="515.64" dur="3.899">and that was the whole point of the</text>
  <text start="517.38" dur="4.32">peopie plus one of all these countries</text>
  <text start="519.539" dur="4.44">signing off and removing the sanctions</text>
  <text start="521.7" dur="3.57">from iran but again we see things are</text>
  <text start="523.979" dur="4.141">falling apart in the Middle East we know</text>
  <text start="525.27" dur="4.68">the prize is Iran we know Iran is not</text>
  <text start="528.12" dur="4.62">going to be selling the oil using the</text>
  <text start="529.95" dur="4.59">dollar and this was this was what the</text>
  <text start="532.74" dur="3.63">deal was really about it wasn&amp;#39;t about</text>
  <text start="534.54" dur="3.81">nuclear weapons it was about bringing in</text>
  <text start="536.37" dur="3.99">a central bank putting the dollar on the</text>
  <text start="538.35" dur="4.89">Natural Resources propping up the dollar</text>
  <text start="540.36" dur="6.39">and we see that Iran is not going along</text>
  <text start="543.24" dur="7.53">with the central bankers and this is the</text>
  <text start="546.75" dur="8.339">real issue we see the UK is going to be</text>
  <text start="550.77" dur="6.059">sending more troops to iraq british</text>
  <text start="555.089" dur="4.141">troops are being sent to iraq and</text>
  <text start="556.829" dur="7.231">there&amp;#39;s going to be more than a thousand</text>
  <text start="559.23" dur="5.28">troops now in iraq it is the most UK</text>

  <text start="564.51" dur="4.29">personnel fighting in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="566.4" dur="5.91">since the withdrawal from Iraq seven</text>
  <text start="568.8" dur="6.78">years ago remember Carter went around to</text>
  <text start="572.31" dur="5.52">all the different countries and he</text>
  <text start="575.58" dur="4.17">convinced them all that you need to</text>
  <text start="577.83" dur="4.74">bring in more military assets more</text>
  <text start="579.75" dur="4.26">troops into this area to help out with</text>
  <text start="582.57" dur="3.9">the fight now they&amp;#39;re really fighting</text>
  <text start="584.01" dur="3.24">the Islamic state no that&amp;#39;s the proxy</text>
  <text start="586.47" dur="2.85">army for the United States government</text>
  <text start="587.25" dur="3.72">central bankers they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="589.32" dur="6.21">fighting that they&amp;#39;re building this up</text>
  <text start="590.97" dur="6.93">preparing for an offensive when it is</text>
  <text start="595.53" dur="5.73">needed now of course we know the Geneva</text>
  <text start="597.9" dur="6.06">talks are going to be starting on March</text>
  <text start="601.26" dur="5.19">14th a lot on the agenda is of course</text>
  <text start="603.96" dur="6.33">Assad stepping down and partitioning</text>
  <text start="606.45" dur="6.66">Syria now we see a UN report came out</text>
  <text start="610.29" dur="5.72">and it has exposed the US and Turkish</text>
  <text start="613.11" dur="5.94">companies because they are flooding</text>
  <text start="616.01" dur="5.08">illegal arms into Libya this is a clear</text>
  <text start="619.05" dur="5.76">violation of the international arms</text>
  <text start="621.09" dur="5.91">embargo now we always know this is</text>
  <text start="624.81" dur="5.4">happening because the u.s. does this</text>
  <text start="627" dur="6.21">covertly along with turkey to help out</text>
  <text start="630.21" dur="5.52">with who yes their proxy armies inside</text>
  <text start="633.21" dur="5.64">the country and we can see this is</text>
  <text start="635.73" dur="6.27">exactly what&amp;#39;s going on here because we</text>
  <text start="638.85" dur="4.98">know all of a sudden when Russia came in</text>
  <text start="642" dur="5.01">started to bomb Syria we know that</text>
  <text start="643.83" dur="4.77">Turkey Saudi Arabia Qatar us they were</text>
  <text start="647.01" dur="3.81">air lifting the Islamic state out of</text>
  <text start="648.6" dur="3.99">Syria and bringing them right into Libya</text>
  <text start="650.82" dur="4.11">and all of a sudden out of nowhere we</text>
  <text start="652.59" dur="4.08">saw the forces in Libya start to build</text>
  <text start="654.93" dur="4.47">and then we saw on the corporate media</text>
  <text start="656.67" dur="6.06">the US government saying yes the Islamic</text>
  <text start="659.4" dur="6.48">state is growing inside of Libya now</text>
  <text start="662.73" dur="7.26">they needed arms so guess what arms are</text>
  <text start="665.88" dur="6.66">flowing into Libya we see that the US</text>
  <text start="669.99" dur="4.74">has their rocket artillery which is</text>
  <text start="672.54" dur="5.13">based in Jordan and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="674.73" dur="4.77">used to help fight in the war against</text>
  <text start="677.67" dur="3.33">the Islamic state now we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="679.5" dur="4.77">not going to be using it for that this</text>
  <text start="681" dur="6.33">is a cover story and they will be using</text>
  <text start="684.27" dur="6.54">it to fight most likely these Syrian</text>
  <text start="687.33" dur="4.65">armed forces and the Pentagon right now</text>
  <text start="690.81" dur="3.39">acknowledged on friday that the</text>
  <text start="691.98" dur="4.38">ground-based rocket artillery fired from</text>
  <text start="694.2" dur="4.26">georgian jordan was used to strike</text>
  <text start="696.36" dur="7.14">targets in the south</text>
  <text start="698.46" dur="6.87">part of Syria so we can see this is</text>
  <text start="703.5" dur="5.34">marking an expansion to the US ground</text>
  <text start="705.33" dur="7.95">operations right now and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="708.84" dur="7.02">happening is that these talks that are</text>
  <text start="713.28" dur="4.77">going to occur starting March for teens</text>
  <text start="715.86" dur="4.38">unless they&amp;#39;re delayed once again it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="718.05" dur="5.54">going to be centered around Assad</text>
  <text start="720.24" dur="6.77">stepping down and splitting up Syria</text>
  <text start="723.59" dur="6.18">this is what they have on their agenda</text>
  <text start="727.01" dur="6">already the Syrian government said well</text>
  <text start="729.77" dur="5.29">Assad stepping down that&amp;#39;s a red line</text>
  <text start="733.01" dur="3.97">this should not even be on the table</text>
  <text start="735.06" dur="4.17">because it&amp;#39;s up to the people which I</text>
  <text start="736.98" dur="4.71">completely agree with the people should</text>
  <text start="739.23" dur="4.62">decide who their ruler is in the country</text>
  <text start="741.69" dur="5.1">if they&amp;#39;re upset with their ruler guess</text>
  <text start="743.85" dur="4.89">what everyone band together and have</text>
  <text start="746.79" dur="3.81">that ruler removed same thing here in</text>
  <text start="748.74" dur="3.72">the United States same thing in Canada</text>
  <text start="750.6" dur="4.08">same thing in Australia same thing in</text>
  <text start="752.46" dur="5.4">the UK if the people are really upset</text>
  <text start="754.68" dur="7.32">let the people decide who their ruler is</text>
  <text start="757.86" dur="6.81">going to be well I shouldn&amp;#39;t say their</text>
  <text start="762" dur="8.87">ruler i should say who&amp;#39;s going to govern</text>
  <text start="764.67" dur="8.82">the country and we see at this point</text>
  <text start="770.87" dur="5.29">this most likely is where everything is</text>
  <text start="773.49" dur="4.23">going to break down but we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="776.16" dur="7.02">have to watch a situation very carefully</text>
  <text start="777.72" dur="12.08">because as we know the u.s. only has</text>
  <text start="783.18" dur="9.96">these two agendas the US wants a</text>
  <text start="789.8" dur="6.58">pipeline built in Syria they want the</text>
  <text start="793.14" dur="5.31">oil fields they want the Natural</text>
  <text start="796.38" dur="5.1">Resources so it can be sold using the</text>
  <text start="798.45" dur="6.27">dollar and eventually they need to get</text>
  <text start="801.48" dur="6.42">into Iran that is the last country they</text>
  <text start="804.72" dur="4.68">need to get into and of course they need</text>
  <text start="807.9" dur="4.05">to get back into all the other countries</text>
  <text start="809.4" dur="5.67">because the people there are rising up</text>
  <text start="811.95" dur="5.07">and fighting the puppet government the</text>
  <text start="815.07" dur="3.15">central banker is saying we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="817.02" dur="3.27">this anymore and we&amp;#39;re seeing it in</text>
  <text start="818.22" dur="5.61">Yemen we&amp;#39;re seeing it in Libya we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="820.29" dur="6.09">seeing it in Lebanon and we see that the</text>
  <text start="823.83" dur="4.56">US and the coalition forces have been</text>
  <text start="826.38" dur="5.91">moving more and more military assets</text>
  <text start="828.39" dur="6.78">into the area and they are prepared</text>
  <text start="832.29" dur="4.919">in getting ready to do something either</text>
  <text start="835.17" dur="4.37">in Syria while we know definitely Libya</text>
  <text start="837.209" dur="5.521">because we had the warning in Lebanon</text>
  <text start="839.54" dur="5.289">that something in the entire area is</text>
  <text start="842.73" dur="5.4">going to occur and most likely it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="844.829" dur="6.661">going to be huge now DHS is out there</text>
  <text start="848.13" dur="7.319">and they&amp;#39;re warning of increased terror</text>
  <text start="851.49" dur="5.7">threat to DC hotels and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="855.449" dur="3.601">that there could be a possibility of a</text>
  <text start="857.19" dur="5.91">terrorist attack at any one of these</text>
  <text start="859.05" dur="6.45">hotels in DC because Isis put out a</text>
  <text start="863.1" dur="4.08">warning saying there could be a possible</text>
  <text start="865.5" dur="3.87">peristyle attack in the United States</text>
  <text start="867.18" dur="6.779">now this is a lot of propaganda because</text>
  <text start="869.37" dur="8.31">as we know DHS NSA FBI when have they</text>
  <text start="873.959" dur="5.69">ever stopped a terrorist attack when did</text>
  <text start="877.68" dur="7.86">they ever have credible information</text>
  <text start="879.649" dur="8.891">about a real attack they never did they</text>
  <text start="885.54" dur="6.419">can&amp;#39;t even prove it to Congress because</text>
  <text start="888.54" dur="6.27">these attacks are an inside job yes they</text>
  <text start="891.959" dur="6.57">put out these warnings yes the FBI finds</text>
  <text start="894.81" dur="6.209">these passes or these individuals with</text>
  <text start="898.529" dur="5.701">low intelligence or who have mental</text>
  <text start="901.019" dur="6.68">problems and they kind of convince them</text>
  <text start="904.23" dur="5.849">that they&amp;#39;re going to be used as a</text>
  <text start="907.699" dur="4.57">terrorist or they supply them with</text>
  <text start="910.079" dur="5.791">weapons or whatever they do to convince</text>
  <text start="912.269" dur="6.06">them but they never had the funds they</text>
  <text start="915.87" dur="4.019">never had the mental capacity to plan</text>
  <text start="918.329" dur="3.69">anything like this this was all the FBI</text>
  <text start="919.889" dur="4.711">so they&amp;#39;ve never done anything but</text>
  <text start="922.019" dur="7.231">they&amp;#39;re giving us this warning and we</text>
  <text start="924.6" dur="8.19">know that in the UK they told us there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="929.25" dur="5.85">going to be this spectacular enormous</text>
  <text start="932.79" dur="4.049">attack and here in the United States</text>
  <text start="935.1" dur="4.38">that mean were warning us about lone</text>
  <text start="936.839" dur="4.86">wolf attacks and the video basically</text>
  <text start="939.48" dur="4.589">says we will kill slaughter and burn</text>
  <text start="941.699" dur="4.62">your people we will attack you very soon</text>
  <text start="944.069" dur="5.401">with anything we can lay our hands on</text>
  <text start="946.319" dur="6.63">now as we know this is more propaganda</text>
  <text start="949.47" dur="5.429">to put the fear in the people and when</text>
  <text start="952.949" dur="4.921">there is another false flag and you</text>
  <text start="954.899" dur="5.611">notice I didn&amp;#39;t say if because we</text>
  <text start="957.87" dur="4.29">realize if things do not go the way the</text>
  <text start="960.51" dur="5.74">US government central bankers want in</text>
  <text start="962.16" dur="6.83">the Middle East and the talks break down</text>
  <text start="966.25" dur="5.98">we are going to see some type of major</text>
  <text start="968.99" dur="6.03">major event and their backs will be</text>
  <text start="972.23" dur="5.13">against the wall and they know at this</text>
  <text start="975.02" dur="4.68">point they need to get into all of these</text>
  <text start="977.36" dur="3.72">areas to prop up the dollar because</text>
  <text start="979.7" dur="3.12">everything is based off the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="981.08" dur="5.52">and if they don&amp;#39;t do this the entire</text>
  <text start="982.82" dur="5.19">system comes crashing down and they</text>
  <text start="986.6" dur="4.95">won&amp;#39;t have the ability to bring it down</text>
  <text start="988.01" dur="5.4">in an orderly fashion to blame it on</text>
  <text start="991.55" dur="4.71">another country or group so at that</text>
  <text start="993.41" dur="4.65">point if we see talks breaking down we</text>
  <text start="996.26" dur="4.23">can expect most likely something to</text>
  <text start="998.06" dur="6.06">happen here and this whole thing will be</text>
  <text start="1000.49" dur="6.74">planned the FBI NSA DHS they will put</text>
  <text start="1004.12" dur="5.07">out absolutely no warning whatsoever</text>
