  <text start="37.6" dur="4.83">november 24th 2015 and the title of this</text>
  <text start="40.629" dur="4.711">episode is it&amp;#39;s time to seriously</text>
  <text start="42.43" dur="4.89">prepare for the economic collapse let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="45.34" dur="4.32">get right into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="47.32" dur="5.489">financial news now as we approach the</text>
  <text start="49.66" dur="5.19">end of this year we are noticing that</text>
  <text start="52.809" dur="4.171">the economic information that the US</text>
  <text start="54.85" dur="3.27">government is providing where the US</text>
  <text start="56.98" dur="3.09">government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="58.12" dur="4.079">controlling certain agencies to provide</text>
  <text start="60.07" dur="4.59">to the public it is starting to</text>
  <text start="62.199" dur="5.521">completely fall apart and separate from</text>
  <text start="64.66" dur="5.04">reality and we know we they can control</text>
  <text start="67.72" dur="4.2">statistical numbers they&amp;#39;re great at</text>
  <text start="69.7" dur="3.93">doing it the great at making it look</text>
  <text start="71.92" dur="4.229">like the economy is doing well when</text>
  <text start="73.63" dur="5.849">actually it is rotting from underneath</text>
  <text start="76.149" dur="5.911">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a lot</text>
  <text start="79.479" dur="4.861">of these agencies their narrative of the</text>
  <text start="82.06" dur="5.22">story is completely falling apart and</text>
  <text start="84.34" dur="5.279">they&amp;#39;re crossing I mean the consumer</text>
  <text start="87.28" dur="5.19">confidence level right now we know the</text>
  <text start="89.619" dur="5.491">government has their own business which</text>
  <text start="92.47" dur="4.289">they fund and then we have Gallup which</text>
  <text start="95.11" dur="2.82">measures the consumer confidence and</text>
  <text start="96.759" dur="3.271">this is completely separate and apart</text>
  <text start="97.93" dur="4.71">and they&amp;#39;re heading in different</text>
  <text start="100.03" dur="4.89">directions and right now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="102.64" dur="4.259">looking at is three months ago the</text>
  <text start="104.92" dur="3.42">consumer confidence it was peeking</text>
  <text start="106.899" dur="4.711">according to the government at eight</text>
  <text start="108.34" dur="6">year highs and everything was absolutely</text>
  <text start="111.61" dur="6.689">perfect now we&amp;#39;re seeing the biggest</text>
  <text start="114.34" dur="7.65">miss since 2009 and what happens is as</text>
  <text start="118.299" dur="5.731">the economy continually declines it gets</text>
  <text start="121.99" dur="4.949">harder and harder to prove that the</text>
  <text start="124.03" dur="5.459">economy is improving because you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="126.939" dur="5.191">say okay the consumer confidence is</text>
  <text start="129.489" dur="4.231">dropped by 20 25 30 points and say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="132.13" dur="3.54">rising because it will not make sense</text>
  <text start="133.72" dur="4.26">whatsoever in the models and it&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="135.67" dur="4.349">completely separate apart from the</text>
  <text start="137.98" dur="3.93">Gallup poll and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="140.019" dur="5.151">that right now right now the consumer</text>
  <text start="141.91" dur="6.81">confidence crash from 90.4 from 99.1</text>
  <text start="145.17" dur="5.14">they can&amp;#39;t manipulate this because they</text>
  <text start="148.72" dur="4.68">would have a hard time explaining why</text>
  <text start="150.31" dur="5.97">they pushed it up so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="153.4" dur="4.41">right now is the economy starting to</text>
  <text start="156.28" dur="5.039">fall apart and people are starting to</text>
  <text start="157.81" dur="6.509">recognize something isn&amp;#39;t right now as</text>
  <text start="161.319" dur="4.65">more and more people get laid off more</text>
  <text start="164.319" dur="3.331">more more people realize this because</text>
  <text start="165.969" dur="3.33">what happens is they&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="167.65" dur="2.849">unemployment rate of five percent and</text>
  <text start="169.299" dur="3.03">they&amp;#39;re saying oh this is going to be</text>
  <text start="170.499" dur="4.74">easy I can get another job no problem</text>
  <text start="172.329" dur="5.461">they go out they put the resume out they</text>
  <text start="175.239" dur="5.67">can&amp;#39;t find that job college graduates</text>
  <text start="177.79" dur="6.539">who are graduating who have all this</text>
  <text start="180.909" dur="6.36">debt can&amp;#39;t find the job and right now</text>
  <text start="184.329" dur="6.06">the low income Americans basically all</text>
  <text start="187.269" dur="5.28">hope is gone they&amp;#39;re saying okay there</text>
  <text start="190.389" dur="3.83">is just nothing out there and the</text>
  <text start="192.549" dur="5.011">consumer confidence for low-income</text>
  <text start="194.219" dur="7.681">household has completely plummeted it</text>
  <text start="197.56" dur="8.639">has gone from a high of 90 down to 39</text>
  <text start="201.9" dur="9.339">going back to two thousand nine levels</text>
  <text start="206.199" dur="7.77">and here&amp;#39;s another example where things</text>
  <text start="211.239" dur="4.95">are completely not making set sweat so a</text>
  <text start="213.969" dur="5.061">sense whatsoever now I&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="216.189" dur="6.151">at the real estate and I&amp;#39;ve gone back on</text>
  <text start="219.03" dur="6.28">to the beginning of 2015 begging of 2014</text>
  <text start="222.34" dur="4.829">and I&amp;#39;ve been tracking everything and</text>
  <text start="225.31" dur="3.539">I&amp;#39;ve been saying that yes prices in</text>
  <text start="227.169" dur="3.75">certain areas are coming down starting</text>
  <text start="228.849" dur="4.081">to spread in two different cities and</text>
  <text start="230.919" dur="3.63">then the national association of</text>
  <text start="232.93" dur="5.459">realtors came out and said yes we have</text>
  <text start="234.549" dur="6.241">four months of median home prices that</text>
  <text start="238.389" dur="5.581">are declining now case-shiller just came</text>
  <text start="240.79" dur="5.369">out and says home prices are growing at</text>
  <text start="243.97" dur="6.03">the fastest pace in the last six months</text>
  <text start="246.159" dur="5.91">so if we have two organizations which</text>
  <text start="250" dur="4.319">are not on the same page right now but</text>
  <text start="252.069" dur="5.34">when I go and I take a look at certain</text>
  <text start="254.319" dur="5.7">areas we see that home prices are</text>
  <text start="257.409" dur="5.07">definitely falling we see that people</text>
  <text start="260.019" dur="5.071">are having a tougher and tougher time</text>
  <text start="262.479" dur="4.44">trying to sell their homes and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="265.09" dur="4.53">staying on the market longer and longer</text>
  <text start="266.919" dur="6.381">and when I look at Case Shiller they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="269.62" dur="7.53">looking at a very specific set of cities</text>
  <text start="273.3" dur="5.77">but when you zoom out from there you see</text>
  <text start="277.15" dur="3.269">it&amp;#39;s starting to spread in all different</text>
  <text start="279.07" dur="2.819">areas and I think this is what the</text>
  <text start="280.419" dur="3.331">national national association of</text>
  <text start="281.889" dur="3.391">realtors are looking at now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="283.75" dur="3.87">believe the national association of</text>
  <text start="285.28" dur="3.75">realtors all the time but this time they</text>
  <text start="287.62" dur="4.32">are measuring it and they are actually</text>
  <text start="289.03" dur="4.59">saying yes prices are coming down and</text>
  <text start="291.94" dur="3.33">I&amp;#39;ve been saying the same thing and</text>
  <text start="293.62" dur="4.45">they&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing as IM</text>
  <text start="295.27" dur="5.02">case-shiller is still</text>
  <text start="298.07" dur="4.17">on that path that everything is fine and</text>
  <text start="300.29" dur="4.32">prices are going up but when you really</text>
  <text start="302.24" dur="4.65">look you can do this on zillow you can</text>
  <text start="304.61" dur="5.52">go on realtor.com and you can take a</text>
  <text start="306.89" dur="6.6">sampling of all different areas and you</text>
  <text start="310.13" dur="5.49">can see what is going on so we have two</text>
  <text start="313.49" dur="3.42">different organizations going in two</text>
  <text start="315.62" dur="4.05">different directions and this is what</text>
  <text start="316.91" dur="5.22">happens when you approach a system that</text>
  <text start="319.67" dur="5.64">is dying all the stories don&amp;#39;t line up</text>
  <text start="322.13" dur="5.16">anymore and we&amp;#39;ve had this back in two</text>
  <text start="325.31" dur="3.93">thousand eight the corporate media was</text>
  <text start="327.29" dur="3.87">out there saying one thing we had Peter</text>
  <text start="329.24" dur="4.74">Schiff saying something completely</text>
  <text start="331.16" dur="5.16">different and it turned out that Peter</text>
  <text start="333.98" dur="4.26">Schiff was absolutely right now here in</text>
  <text start="336.32" dur="6.09">the United States manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="338.24" dur="8.79">continually declining we have hit a 25</text>
  <text start="342.41" dur="6.48">month low and basically US firms are</text>
  <text start="347.03" dur="4.83">reporting that output and new orders</text>
  <text start="348.89" dur="6.39">have completely slowed and coming and</text>
  <text start="351.86" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;ve come to a standstill so</text>
  <text start="355.28" dur="3.87">something is wrong here where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="357.41" dur="3.84">looking at all these economic indicators</text>
  <text start="359.15" dur="5.04">and we&amp;#39;re showing that this economy is</text>
  <text start="361.25" dur="5.64">really starting to fall apart and we</text>
  <text start="364.19" dur="6.92">have to remember we have not been adding</text>
  <text start="366.89" dur="7.86">any jobs to the manufacturing sector</text>
  <text start="371.11" dur="5.74">we&amp;#39;ve been losing jobs and actually if</text>
  <text start="374.75" dur="5.19">you notice from 2008 we&amp;#39;ve lost about</text>
  <text start="376.85" dur="6.83">1.4 million manufacturing jobs and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="379.94" dur="9.3">put on 1.5 million service oriented</text>
  <text start="383.68" dur="9.36">low-paying jobs and an economy cannot</text>
  <text start="389.24" dur="7.38">sustain itself on and on</text>
  <text start="393.04" dur="6.88">service-oriented type of jobs it just</text>
  <text start="396.62" dur="6.99">cannot happen and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="399.92" dur="6.18">seeing in the United States now the US</text>
  <text start="403.61" dur="5.55">government decided hmmm the third</text>
  <text start="406.1" dur="5.04">quarter GDP numbers they didn&amp;#39;t grow</text>
  <text start="409.16" dur="3.99">enough so we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="411.14" dur="4.31">manipulate them and go back and revise</text>
  <text start="413.15" dur="4.65">them and this is exactly what they did</text>
  <text start="415.45" dur="5.47">so they took the GDP numbers that were</text>
  <text start="417.8" dur="5.43">out there and they took it and they</text>
  <text start="420.92" dur="5.88">increased it to two point zero five</text>
  <text start="423.23" dur="7.59">percent how did they do this well they</text>
  <text start="426.8" dur="4.71">added whatever was in inventory and this</text>
  <text start="430.82" dur="2.55">is how they mean</text>
  <text start="431.51" dur="7.4">be late the numbers the original</text>
  <text start="433.37" dur="8.55">inventory was 60 2.2 billion dollars</text>
  <text start="438.91" dur="5.74">they revised it and said okay now we</text>
  <text start="441.92" dur="5.94">have a hundred point six billion in</text>
  <text start="444.65" dur="5.76">inventory so that means GDP is going to</text>
  <text start="447.86" dur="6.9">be raised up and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="450.41" dur="10.23">they did so we saw a 40 billion surge in</text>
  <text start="454.76" dur="7.92">inventories to boost gdp up and they use</text>
  <text start="460.64" dur="4.47">Obamacare for this they use many</text>
  <text start="462.68" dur="4.17">different tricks to manipulate the</text>
  <text start="465.11" dur="4.05">numbers and again these numbers are</text>
  <text start="466.85" dur="6.12">completely separate and apart from</text>
  <text start="469.16" dur="6.39">reality they&amp;#39;re pushing anything they</text>
  <text start="472.97" dur="7.26">possibly can into GDP numbers to boost</text>
  <text start="475.55" dur="8.04">it up now the richmond fed shows that</text>
  <text start="480.23" dur="6.24">the third monthly decline is happening</text>
  <text start="483.59" dur="6.57">as wages are crashing most in four years</text>
  <text start="486.47" dur="7.16">the last three times this happened guess</text>
  <text start="490.16" dur="6.33">what the US was either in a recession or</text>
  <text start="493.63" dur="6.58">the Fed came out and said okay we need</text>
  <text start="496.49" dur="6.27">to unleash qe3 and from all this data</text>
  <text start="500.21" dur="6.21">that we&amp;#39;re seeing we are seeing more and</text>
  <text start="502.76" dur="7.35">more of these signs showing us that the</text>
  <text start="506.42" dur="7.71">economy is completely collapsing and it</text>
  <text start="510.11" dur="6.45">cannot be sustained David Stockman is</text>
  <text start="514.13" dur="4.44">out there and he&amp;#39;s saying another</text>
  <text start="516.56" dur="4.7">financial crisis is completely</text>
  <text start="518.57" dur="7.02">unavoidable the central banks are</text>
  <text start="521.26" dur="6.22">completely out of ammunition they have</text>
  <text start="525.59" dur="4.74">nothing else to do but they always seem</text>
  <text start="527.48" dur="5.07">to manipulate something just to keep the</text>
  <text start="530.33" dur="5.31">system propped up just for a little bit</text>
  <text start="532.55" dur="5.97">longer he said we&amp;#39;re headed for a very</text>
  <text start="535.64" dur="6.38">severe monetary crisis and a period of</text>
  <text start="538.52" dur="5.97">great instability the very opposite of</text>
  <text start="542.02" dur="4.6">what has been experienced for the last</text>
  <text start="544.49" dur="4.28">six seven years well the last six seven</text>
  <text start="546.62" dur="4.8">years we have been in a bubble state</text>
  <text start="548.77" dur="4.74">where the central bank controls the</text>
  <text start="551.42" dur="4.59">economy where the central bank is</text>
  <text start="553.51" dur="4.33">keeping the system propped up with the</text>
  <text start="556.01" dur="3.27">auto loan bubbles with the derivative</text>
  <text start="557.84" dur="4.23">bubbles the Treasury bond bubbles the</text>
  <text start="559.28" dur="5.55">stock market bubble the student loan</text>
  <text start="562.07" dur="6.99">bubble the real estate bubble and</text>
  <text start="564.83" dur="6.87">these bubbles are about to pop but he</text>
  <text start="569.06" dur="4.47">said what&amp;#39;s going to change all of this</text>
  <text start="571.7" dur="4.2">is that we&amp;#39;re reaching the point where</text>
  <text start="573.53" dur="4.59">the central banks are out of dry powder</text>
  <text start="575.9" dur="3.99">I don&amp;#39;t think the central banks have</text>
  <text start="578.12" dur="3.86">infinite power I don&amp;#39;t think they can</text>
  <text start="579.89" dur="5.52">keep interest rates oppressed forever if</text>
  <text start="581.98" dur="4.78">confidence is lost and they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="585.41" dur="4.29">to be able to control the markets</text>
  <text start="586.76" dur="4.68">indefinitely and they know this and this</text>
  <text start="589.7" dur="5.37">is why they&amp;#39;re making preparations to</text>
  <text start="591.44" dur="6.75">bring down the economy again they want</text>
  <text start="595.07" dur="6.35">to do this their own way they want to</text>
  <text start="598.19" dur="6.75">make sure they have everything set up to</text>
  <text start="601.42" dur="5.71">blame this on another group or a country</text>
  <text start="604.94" dur="3.42">this is what this is all about because</text>
  <text start="607.13" dur="2.7">you have to remember the United States</text>
  <text start="608.36" dur="3.3">government central bankers thought</text>
  <text start="609.83" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;d be able to get into all these</text>
  <text start="611.66" dur="3.93">different areas they were able they</text>
  <text start="614.6" dur="4.35">thought they were going to be able to</text>
  <text start="615.59" dur="5.97">take the dollar and prop it up by making</text>
  <text start="618.95" dur="4.23">countries use the dollar on their</text>
  <text start="621.56" dur="3.2">natural resources and when I say natural</text>
  <text start="623.18" dur="4.89">resources I&amp;#39;m talking about their oil</text>
  <text start="624.76" dur="5.2">which forms then the petro dollar but</text>
  <text start="628.07" dur="5.46">what&amp;#39;s happening right now is they are</text>
  <text start="629.96" dur="5.31">losing the battle out in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="633.53" dur="6.8">they couldn&amp;#39;t get into Venezuela</text>
  <text start="635.27" dur="7.53">Argentina and basically they try to</text>
  <text start="640.33" dur="8.35">capture the natural gas market in</text>
  <text start="642.8" dur="8.76">Ukraine and they just can&amp;#39;t seem to get</text>
  <text start="648.68" dur="5.04">things right at this point everything</text>
  <text start="651.56" dur="4.38">they tried they kind of messed up and</text>
  <text start="653.72" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re losing control all over the</text>
  <text start="655.94" dur="7.44">place and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="659.24" dur="6.9">a complete and total destruction of the</text>
  <text start="663.38" dur="6.24">petro dollar we see China on the other</text>
  <text start="666.14" dur="5.94">hand they are making bilateral deals all</text>
  <text start="669.62" dur="5.85">across the world and we see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="672.08" dur="7.53">setting up you one remember trading hubs</text>
  <text start="675.47" dur="6.72">and every time they do this basically it</text>
  <text start="679.61" dur="5.4">cuts into the dollars power it takes</text>
