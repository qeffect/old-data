  <text start="180.72" dur="6.08">UK with the brexit the brexit deal is</text>
  <text start="184.02" dur="5.7">not going over too well here and</text>
  <text start="186.8" dur="4.84">according to European the president of</text>

  <text start="201.45" dur="5.85">extended they noted however that</text>
  <text start="204.51" dur="7.83">Brussels would not agree to any changes</text>
  <text start="207.3" dur="7.29">to the deal so we know the UK government</text>
  <text start="212.34" dur="7.32">they are going to vote on this On</text>
  <text start="214.59" dur="7.53">January 15 but at this point I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="219.66" dur="5.64">think May is going to get enough votes</text>
  <text start="222.12" dur="5.52">for her deal and if they postpone this</text>
  <text start="225.3" dur="4.05">the EU says they don&amp;#39;t have a problem</text>
  <text start="227.64" dur="5.52">with this but don&amp;#39;t expect them to</text>
  <text start="229.35" dur="8.13">change their deal why do they want them</text>
  <text start="233.16" dur="7.98">to extend the deadline because they want</text>
  <text start="237.48" dur="8.58">May to convince her government to vote</text>
  <text start="241.14" dur="7.23">on this brexit deal the EU is not going</text>
