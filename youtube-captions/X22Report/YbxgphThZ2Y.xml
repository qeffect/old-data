  <text start="78.479" dur="3.96">pushing the Russian narrative they just</text>
  <text start="80.399" dur="4.381">they really don&amp;#39;t want to give up on</text>
  <text start="82.439" dur="4.11">this and every time they come out with</text>
  <text start="84.78" dur="4.8">it they&amp;#39;re proving to be completely</text>
  <text start="86.549" dur="4.74">wrong every single time now we</text>

  <text start="94.5" dur="5.039">starting to look like it was a set up by</text>

  <text start="99.539" dur="5.101">administration along with the Clintons</text>
  <text start="102.06" dur="4.77">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that these key</text>
  <text start="104.64" dur="4.56">players were all part of their</text>
  <text start="106.83" dur="5.489">organizations and there were deals made</text>
  <text start="109.2" dur="5.64">and it allowed them to get a FISA</text>
  <text start="112.319" dur="4.47">warrant and the New York Times they came</text>
  <text start="114.84" dur="4.529">out with their article you know</text>

  <text start="131.7" dur="5.1">also mentioned this translator who was</text>
  <text start="135.269" dur="5.19">there during the meeting translating</text>
  <text start="136.8" dur="5.37">what was being said and the times well</text>
  <text start="140.459" dur="5.371">they didn&amp;#39;t provide any background on</text>
  <text start="142.17" dur="7.739">the translator beyond reporting his name</text>
  <text start="145.83" dur="6.09">and that he translates that&amp;#39;s it but</text>
  <text start="149.909" dur="5.22">when we look further into this</text>
  <text start="151.92" dur="7.23">individual and this name this</text>
  <text start="155.129" dur="6.89">individuals name is SEMO kornev well we</text>
  <text start="159.15" dur="6.5">find out that this Russian translator</text>
  <text start="162.019" dur="5.981">worked on behalf of the State Department</text>
  <text start="165.65" dur="6.64">including during Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="168" dur="6.239">tenure as Secretary of State and he was</text>
  <text start="172.29" dur="4.89">present at the meeting but they left</text>
  <text start="174.239" dur="4.11">this part out they just mentioned his</text>
  <text start="177.18" dur="4.08">name didn&amp;#39;t go into any type of</text>
  <text start="178.349" dur="5.881">background now he is also the product</text>
  <text start="181.26" dur="4.11">manager at the Meridian International</text>
  <text start="184.23" dur="4.14">Center which</text>
  <text start="185.37" dur="5.22">describes itself as a nonprofit global</text>
  <text start="188.37" dur="5.009">leadership organization headquartered in</text>
  <text start="190.59" dur="5.039">Washington DC the Meridian is a</text>
  <text start="193.379" dur="5.311">principal partner of the US State</text>
  <text start="195.629" dur="5.131">Department he worked on behalf of the</text>
  <text start="198.69" dur="4.889">State Department purportedly while he</text>
  <text start="200.76" dur="4.319">was at Meridian the timeline of his work</text>
  <text start="203.579" dur="4.44">at Meridian includes the period when</text>
  <text start="205.079" dur="8.701">Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State</text>
  <text start="208.019" dur="8.881">and this is very interesting because his</text>
  <text start="213.78" dur="4.62">job and what he did well he represented</text>
  <text start="216.9" dur="3.899">the US government in securing</text>
  <text start="218.4" dur="5.669">cooperation of key US resources in the</text>
  <text start="220.799" dur="5.671">corporate governmental and NGO community</text>
  <text start="224.069" dur="4.081">he collaborated with the US and</text>
  <text start="226.47" dur="3.87">international aid agencies and</text>
  <text start="228.15" dur="4.259">stakeholders on devising business plans</text>
  <text start="230.34" dur="4.679">and training workshops on a variety of</text>
  <text start="232.409" dur="4.621">different topics and was listed as the</text>
  <text start="235.019" dur="4.231">program administrator for this State</text>
  <text start="237.03" dur="4.62">Department&amp;#39;s international visitor</text>
  <text start="239.25" dur="5.069">Leadership Program which is implemented</text>
  <text start="241.65" dur="5.61">by Meridian so once again we have</text>
  <text start="244.319" dur="6.6">another connection to the Clinton to the</text>
  <text start="247.26" dur="5.37">Obama administration and as we start</text>
  <text start="250.919" dur="5.901">putting a lot of these pieces together</text>
  <text start="252.63" dur="10.92">we&amp;#39;re starting to realize now that this</text>
  <text start="256.82" dur="11.26">entire operation was created and brought</text>
  <text start="263.55" dur="6.75">about to basically frame Trump jr.</text>
  <text start="268.08" dur="4.38">because think about it they went into</text>
  <text start="270.3" dur="4.049">the meeting and they said they had all</text>
  <text start="272.46" dur="4.59">this information on Hillary Clinton and</text>
  <text start="274.349" dur="4.5">there was nothing and then there was a</text>
  <text start="277.05" dur="5.04">translator there there was a lobbyist</text>
  <text start="278.849" dur="5.641">there because the real agenda was not</text>
  <text start="282.09" dur="4.77">about that they were sent in there for</text>
  <text start="284.49" dur="4.709">that but the real agenda was about</text>
  <text start="286.86" dur="8.429">something completely different the</text>
  <text start="289.199" dur="9.78">Magnitsky act and the Obama</text>
  <text start="295.289" dur="7.171">administration at this point in time use</text>
  <text start="298.979" dur="6.901">this to go for a warrant to say see he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.46" dur="5.459">meeting with Russians he didn&amp;#39;t ask for</text>
  <text start="305.88" dur="6.81">the meeting these people were</text>
  <text start="307.919" dur="7.201">approaching him for a specific purpose</text>
  <text start="312.69" dur="5.07">and when we start breaking it down we</text>
  <text start="315.12" dur="3.519">can see what that purpose was it was to</text>
  <text start="317.76" dur="4.51">entrap</text>
  <text start="318.639" dur="6.84">Trump jr. now it looks like CNN is out</text>
  <text start="322.27" dur="6.06">there well creating fake news once again</text>
  <text start="325.479" dur="5.011">and we talked about this before where</text>
  <text start="328.33" dur="5.28">they came out and they said Russia did</text>
  <text start="330.49" dur="4.47">the hacking on Qatar and this is what</text>
  <text start="333.61" dur="3.389">started the whole thing</text>
  <text start="334.96" dur="4.829">because they released it the information</text>
  <text start="336.999" dur="6.69">to the other Gulf nations and even the</text>
  <text start="339.789" dur="7.22">US intelligence community confirmed that</text>
  <text start="343.689" dur="7.47">yes it was Russia who did the hacking</text>
  <text start="347.009" dur="8.201">now the Washington Post is out there and</text>
  <text start="351.159" dur="6.69">they are saying well no it looks like it</text>
  <text start="355.21" dur="5.669">was the United Arab Emirates that</text>
  <text start="357.849" dur="6.09">actually was hacking Qatar that was</text>
  <text start="360.879" dur="5.91">releasing the information it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="363.939" dur="4.141">Russia and you could see the headline</text>
  <text start="366.789" dur="3.511">from CNN</text>
  <text start="368.08" dur="4.53">it says CNN exclusive US suspects</text>
  <text start="370.3" dur="5.82">Russian hackers planted fake news behind</text>
  <text start="372.61" dur="6.809">Qatar crisis now remember the FBI sent a</text>
  <text start="376.12" dur="5.909">team of investigators to the Qatari</text>
  <text start="379.419" dur="4.831">government they investigated the alleged</text>
  <text start="382.029" dur="3.54">hacking incident and the intelligence</text>
  <text start="384.25" dur="4.05">gathered by the US Security Agency</text>
  <text start="385.569" dur="7.53">indicates that Russia was the hacking</text>
  <text start="388.3" dur="7.889">force that did all of this now since the</text>
  <text start="393.099" dur="6.271">Washington Post said now we&amp;#39;ve done some</text>
  <text start="396.189" dur="5.581">research here and it looks like it was</text>
  <text start="399.37" dur="4.769">the United Arab Emirates they</text>
  <text start="401.77" dur="5.549">orchestrated the hacking of the Qatari</text>
  <text start="404.139" dur="7.381">government now this is very interesting</text>
  <text start="407.319" dur="7.891">because the u.s. intelligence the CIA</text>
  <text start="411.52" dur="5.97">well they flip-flop now and they said</text>
  <text start="415.21" dur="6.419">yeah yeah it wasn&amp;#39;t Russia it was the</text>
  <text start="417.49" dur="8.669">UAE now why would they flip-flop all of</text>
  <text start="421.629" dur="10.831">a sudden when they were so sure it was</text>
  <text start="426.159" dur="9.99">Russia so within a month they just</text>
  <text start="432.46" dur="5.79">changed their story now supposedly they</text>
  <text start="436.149" dur="4.77">had all this proof supposedly they had</text>
  <text start="438.25" dur="5.099">all this information now was it really</text>
  <text start="440.919" dur="4.98">the UAE no most likely it was the</text>
  <text start="443.349" dur="5.79">intelligence agencies may be working</text>
  <text start="445.899" dur="5.811">with some of the Gulf nations but we can</text>
  <text start="449.139" dur="4.581">see at this point again</text>
  <text start="451.71" dur="4.74">if you look this up and you saw this</text>
  <text start="453.72" dur="6.03">story the fact checkers would say this</text>
  <text start="456.45" dur="5.4">is a true story anyone else who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="459.75" dur="5.67">looking at the story and saying it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="461.85" dur="6.87">true well that would be the false story</text>
  <text start="465.42" dur="4.23">which now once again shows that it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="468.72" dur="5.3">other way around</text>
  <text start="469.65" dur="7.44">and again the intelligence community is</text>
  <text start="474.02" dur="5.29">controlling this I mean think about it</text>
  <text start="477.09" dur="3.69">they went over there they investigated</text>
  <text start="479.31" dur="3.84">and they came out with their findings</text>
  <text start="480.78" dur="5.4">and said it was Russia so what kind of</text>
  <text start="483.15" dur="4.77">investigation did they actually do well</text>
  <text start="486.18" dur="5.94">they didn&amp;#39;t do any because they already</text>
  <text start="487.92" dur="7.44">knew who did it it&amp;#39;s actually them same</text>
  <text start="492.12" dur="5.82">thing with the hacking of anything that</text>
  <text start="495.36" dur="4.17">goes on here because remember with the</text>
  <text start="497.94" dur="3.96">release of what week you leaks has shown</text>
  <text start="499.53" dur="7.32">us they can pretend that it&amp;#39;s any</text>
  <text start="501.9" dur="6.74">country and especially Russia or Iran or</text>
  <text start="506.85" dur="4.41">anyone else</text>
  <text start="508.64" dur="5.14">so should we believe them anymore</text>
  <text start="511.26" dur="6.33">because we&amp;#39;re starting to see the same</text>
  <text start="513.78" dur="6.96">pattern repeat over time now out in</text>
  <text start="517.59" dur="6.99">North Korea and South Korea we see that</text>
  <text start="520.74" dur="9.42">moon jae-in well he&amp;#39;s taking the first</text>
  <text start="524.58" dur="9.33">step and he is inviting North Korea to</text>
  <text start="530.16" dur="6.24">participate in military talks now this</text>
  <text start="533.91" dur="4.97">is the first formal overture by the</text>
  <text start="536.4" dur="5.82">newly elected president moon jae-in and</text>
  <text start="538.88" dur="5.74">this is a diplomatic outreach to say</text>
  <text start="542.22" dur="4.74">listen let&amp;#39;s calm this down let&amp;#39;s have</text>
  <text start="544.62" dur="5.04">our military speak to each other</text>
  <text start="546.96" dur="4.47">let&amp;#39;s have cooperation now we have to</text>
  <text start="549.66" dur="3.41">see what North Korea does and a lot of</text>
  <text start="551.43" dur="5.52">these headlines that are coming out that</text>
  <text start="553.07" dur="5.71">Kim jong-un wants to destroy Trump Kim</text>
  <text start="556.95" dur="3.48">jong-un is going to fire missiles into</text>
  <text start="558.78" dur="5.1">the United States and obliterate the</text>
  <text start="560.43" dur="6.51">United States most of this is not coming</text>
  <text start="563.88" dur="5.67">from North Korea most of this is coming</text>
  <text start="566.94" dur="5.64">from the South Korean news agency or</text>
  <text start="569.55" dur="6.18">intelligence community pushing their</text>
  <text start="572.58" dur="4.44">agenda because when you really look at</text>
  <text start="575.73" dur="3.99">this and you look at the entire</text>
  <text start="577.02" dur="5.82">situation you can see that all of this</text>
  <text start="579.72" dur="4.98">is being built up to bring us to the</text>
  <text start="582.84" dur="2.64">next stage and that is war that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="584.7" dur="3.389">they want</text>
  <text start="585.48" dur="4.56">but it looks like it is failing and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="588.089" dur="4.291">not going the way they want because</text>
  <text start="590.04" dur="3.84">Russia was out there the South Korean</text>
  <text start="592.38" dur="3.389">intelligence community was out there</text>
  <text start="593.88" dur="3.209">saying yeah the last missile test that</text>
  <text start="595.769" dur="4.401">was in a ballistic missile</text>
  <text start="597.089" dur="6.151">it was another medium-range missile and</text>
  <text start="600.17" dur="4.3">we have the data that proves it and the</text>
  <text start="603.24" dur="4.5">United States what are they going to do</text>
  <text start="604.47" dur="5.609">are they going to say no we have the</text>
  <text start="607.74" dur="4.17">data to and its ballistic well Russia</text>
  <text start="610.079" dur="3.81">said prove it show us the data and</text>
  <text start="611.91" dur="5.609">that&amp;#39;s where everything fell apart once</text>
  <text start="613.889" dur="6.151">again now Finland they are preparing for</text>
  <text start="617.519" dur="4.531">a Russian invasion because Russia is</text>
  <text start="620.04" dur="5.07">going to conduct their 2017 military</text>
  <text start="622.05" dur="5.52">exercise in September and they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="625.11" dur="5.099">worried about this because Russia might</text>
  <text start="627.57" dur="5.55">try some type of invasion which is</text>
  <text start="630.209" dur="6.601">absolutely ridiculous and right now</text>
  <text start="633.12" dur="6.06">Finland&amp;#39;s government they are telling</text>
  <text start="636.81" dur="5.82">their citizens their residents that</text>
  <text start="639.18" dur="6.149">don&amp;#39;t worry we have our 124 mile worth</text>
  <text start="642.63" dur="6.6">of tunnels passageways and shelters that</text>
  <text start="645.329" dur="7.62">will protect you if Russia does attack</text>
  <text start="649.23" dur="6.659">and these tunnels they have these</text>
  <text start="652.949" dur="5.94">impregnable defensive doors that will</text>
  <text start="655.889" dur="5.43">shut their blast doors they will seal</text>
  <text start="658.889" dur="4.32">the tunnels off and protect everyone and</text>
  <text start="661.319" dur="4.2">we can see right now this is just a</text>
  <text start="663.209" dur="5.011">scare tactic first of all if you look</text>
  <text start="665.519" dur="3.721">what Russia does they do not attack</text>
  <text start="668.22" dur="3.359">anyone</text>
  <text start="669.24" dur="5.73">they haven&amp;#39;t I mean they said they were</text>
  <text start="671.579" dur="5.331">going to attack in 2013 never happened</text>
  <text start="674.97" dur="5.489">they were going to bring their armed</text>
  <text start="676.91" dur="5.83">forces into Ukraine and attack and the</text>
  <text start="680.459" dur="4.471">Ukrainian puppet government was trying</text>
  <text start="682.74" dur="4.95">to prove that they were invading Ukraine</text>
  <text start="684.93" dur="4.86">and that was never happening either that</text>
  <text start="687.69" dur="4.019">they used their Armed Forces and they</text>
  <text start="689.79" dur="5.15">went in there with military force and</text>
  <text start="691.709" dur="7.291">they stole Crimea no Crimea they voted</text>
  <text start="694.94" dur="6.55">to move their little section away from</text>
  <text start="699" dur="4.17">the puppet government that was put into</text>
  <text start="701.49" dur="4.44">place by the United States government</text>
  <text start="703.17" dur="6.12">central bankers the deep state at the</text>
  <text start="705.93" dur="6.719">time it was a coup d&amp;#39;état led by the</text>
  <text start="709.29" dur="6.96">deep state now we&amp;#39;ve heard all these</text>
  <text start="712.649" dur="5.761">rumors that Baghdady was killed it was</text>
  <text start="716.25" dur="3.04">confirmation we heard what this or the</text>
  <text start="718.41" dur="2.89">last</text>
  <text start="719.29" dur="5.19">and now the Iraqis are out there saying</text>
  <text start="721.3" dur="4.89">no we&amp;#39;re getting information that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="724.48" dur="3.72">still alive do you know how many times</text>
  <text start="726.19" dur="4.11">this man has been killed and like I said</text>

  <text start="773.14" dur="5.4">removing the Islamic state and we can</text>
  <text start="775.63" dur="4.98">see that time is ticking down right now</text>
  <text start="778.54" dur="3.12">Russia right now their military that has</text>
  <text start="780.61" dur="3.15">been deployed to the</text>

  <text start="783.76" dur="5.16">indefinite operation to monitor the</text>
  <text start="785.62" dur="5.4">ceasefire in southern Syria and we can</text>
  <text start="788.92" dur="3.39">see that the Syrian opposition</text>
  <text start="791.02" dur="2.88">you know the terrorist groups that</text>
  <text start="792.31" dur="5.82">United States deep state put together</text>
  <text start="793.9" dur="6.54">well they are feeling betrayed by the</text>
  <text start="798.13" dur="4.38">deep state because they sign the</text>
  <text start="800.44" dur="4.98">de-escalation agreement with Russia and</text>
  <text start="802.51" dur="4.14">the the deep state the United States is</text>
  <text start="805.42" dur="5.52">not working in the best interest for</text>
  <text start="806.65" dur="7.82">them well once again things are now</text>
  <text start="810.94" dur="6.87">changing now Israel is very angry and</text>
  <text start="814.47" dur="5.53">Israel is rejecting the ceasefire deal</text>
  <text start="817.81" dur="4.83">between the US and Russia in the</text>
  <text start="820" dur="5.37">southern Syria area Prime Minister</text>
  <text start="822.64" dur="5.37">Benjamin Netanyahu is out there saying</text>
  <text start="825.37" dur="6.54">that listen they said they were going to</text>
  <text start="828.01" dur="7.08">take our issues and look at them and we</text>
  <text start="831.91" dur="5.46">will be involved and right now they</text>
  <text start="835.09" dur="5.78">haven&amp;#39;t done this whatsoever and we</text>
  <text start="837.37" dur="6.33">object to this ceasefire now once again</text>
  <text start="840.87" dur="5.77">what does Israel really have to do with</text>
  <text start="843.7" dur="6.84">this because isn&amp;#39;t this an uprising of</text>
  <text start="846.64" dur="5.49">the rebels an uprising of this</text>
  <text start="850.54" dur="4.23">grassroots group</text>
  <text start="852.13" dur="4.14">who are made up of Syrians away it is</text>
  <text start="854.77" dur="4.56">not made up of Syrians it&amp;#39;s made up of</text>
  <text start="856.27" dur="4.89">paid mercenaries I think maybe 5% is</text>
  <text start="859.33" dur="4.83">Syrian right now the rest are just</text>
  <text start="861.16" dur="5.51">terrorist groups and paid mercenaries so</text>
  <text start="864.16" dur="4.8">why is Israel involved in this well</text>
  <text start="866.67" dur="4.54">according to The Wall Street Journal</text>
  <text start="868.96" dur="4.38">where they did this whole article on how</text>
  <text start="871.21" dur="4.35">Israel is supporting all these terrorist</text>
  <text start="873.34" dur="5.82">groups funding them housing them</text>
  <text start="875.56" dur="6.12">clothing them bring them into hospitals</text>
  <text start="879.16" dur="4.26">helping them out this is why they have a</text>
  <text start="881.68" dur="4.89">vested interest because this was all</text>
  <text start="883.42" dur="5.34">part of the entire plan it was the</text>
  <text start="886.57" dur="5.33">coalition forces the deep state Israel</text>
  <text start="888.76" dur="5.49">all involved in removing Assad and</text>
  <text start="891.9" dur="3.4">they&amp;#39;re seeing their plan being flushed</text>
  <text start="894.25" dur="4.62">down the toilet</text>
  <text start="895.3" dur="5.85">now we need to understand the deep state</text>
  <text start="898.87" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re still pushing their mission they</text>
  <text start="901.15" dur="3.3">don&amp;#39;t care about the terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="902.68" dur="4.44">anymore they don&amp;#39;t care about the</text>
  <text start="904.45" dur="5.22">moderate rebels they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="907.12" dur="4.32">all of these forces al Qaeda and the</text>
  <text start="909.67" dur="4.38">rest because what they&amp;#39;re doing right</text>
  <text start="911.44" dur="5.31">now is they&amp;#39;re setting up these eight to</text>
  <text start="914.05" dur="5.28">nine bases and they&amp;#39;re trying to break</text>
  <text start="916.75" dur="6.24">off Syria and say this is going to be</text>
  <text start="919.33" dur="5.88">this Kurd area now we need to understand</text>
  <text start="922.99" dur="5.73">what Russia is doing because when we</text>
  <text start="925.21" dur="5.52">start to look closely at what their plan</text>
  <text start="928.72" dur="4.11">is what their strategy is it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="930.73" dur="3.9">interesting now we know the deep state</text>
  <text start="932.83" dur="3.66">their funding</text>
  <text start="934.63" dur="5.06">they&amp;#39;re bringing in weapons to the Kurds</text>
  <text start="936.49" dur="6.42">they&amp;#39;re trying to break Syria into two</text>
  <text start="939.69" dur="5.98">what has Russia done now it looks like</text>
  <text start="942.91" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;ve done nothing but when you really</text>
  <text start="945.67" dur="5.43">look at what they&amp;#39;ve been doing they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="947.98" dur="5.76">worked with Turkey now remember turkey</text>
  <text start="951.1" dur="5.43">shot down a Russian jet that had no</text>
  <text start="953.74" dur="7.29">air-to-air missiles it only had bombs to</text>
  <text start="956.53" dur="7.5">hit the ground and after that Russia was</text>
  <text start="961.03" dur="4.65">very angry pissed off at Turkey Turkey</text>
  <text start="964.03" dur="5.57">was working with the United States and</text>
  <text start="965.68" dur="6.42">then slowly Russia kind of won them over</text>
  <text start="969.6" dur="4.83">made a deal with them to have the</text>
  <text start="972.1" dur="5.37">Turkish pipeline go through Turkey</text>
  <text start="974.43" dur="6.76">turkey started to work with Russia and</text>
  <text start="977.47" dur="6.36">if you noticed Russia really doesn&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="981.19" dur="6.48">much as Turkey</text>
  <text start="983.83" dur="6.3">has moved into Syria and you know this</text>
  <text start="987.67" dur="6.75">has been bothering me all along of why</text>
  <text start="990.13" dur="7.26">Russia is allowing this well Turkey&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="994.42" dur="5.49">mission and we could see that Russia has</text>
  <text start="997.39" dur="5.28">worked with Turkey saying listen if you</text>
  <text start="999.91" dur="7.83">want this pipeline if you want this deal</text>
  <text start="1002.67" dur="7.59">and you want us to forgive you for what</text>
  <text start="1007.74" dur="6.36">you have done you are going to need to</text>
  <text start="1010.26" dur="8.13">work with us and do one thing and that</text>
  <text start="1014.1" dur="7.41">thing is make sure Syria is not broken</text>
  <text start="1018.39" dur="7.86">into two now Russia is not going to come</text>
  <text start="1021.51" dur="9.9">out and attack the Kurdish people or</text>
  <text start="1026.25" dur="8.4">attack the US forces turkey has already</text>
  <text start="1031.41" dur="6.679">designated the Kurdish group that the</text>
  <text start="1034.65" dur="6.54">u.s. is backing now as a terrorist group</text>
  <text start="1038.089" dur="7.031">now doesn&amp;#39;t matter if they are not No</text>
  <text start="1041.19" dur="8.4">their mission is to make sure that the</text>
  <text start="1045.12" dur="7.38">deep state doesn&amp;#39;t split up Syria using</text>
  <text start="1049.59" dur="4.32">the Kurds this is why turkey is out</text>
  <text start="1052.5" dur="3.75">there and they&amp;#39;re bringing in military</text>
  <text start="1053.91" dur="5.31">assets right now this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1056.25" dur="5.94">pushing them out of certain regions this</text>
  <text start="1059.22" dur="6.54">is why they&amp;#39;re continually attacking and</text>
  <text start="1062.19" dur="6.78">trying to stop this this is Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1065.76" dur="5.37">strategy to stop this from happening</text>
  <text start="1068.97" dur="4.62">now if you look turkey has already</text>
  <text start="1071.13" dur="4.94">warned publicly it was preparing for a</text>
  <text start="1073.59" dur="5.01">military intervention in Syria and</text>
  <text start="1076.07" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re accusing the u.s. of creating</text>
  <text start="1078.6" dur="5.22">territory because right now turkey is</text>
  <text start="1080.69" dur="7.3">teamed up with Russia the u.s. is trying</text>
  <text start="1083.82" dur="7.86">to use the courage right now and right</text>
  <text start="1087.99" dur="7.91">now the YPG forms a major part of the</text>
  <text start="1091.68" dur="8.37">us-backed campaign to capture the</text>
  <text start="1095.9" dur="7.42">territory of Syria and they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="1100.05" dur="5.88">this group and right now turkey is</text>
  <text start="1103.32" dur="5.07">saying listen we&amp;#39;re coming in there this</text>
  <text start="1105.93" dur="4.65">is not going to happen so we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1108.39" dur="4.77">have to watch how this plays out and if</text>
  <text start="1110.58" dur="3.93">you notice Russia is staying back out of</text>
  <text start="1113.16" dur="3.39">the picture</text>
  <text start="1114.51" dur="5.21">and they don&amp;#39;t have to be involved in</text>
  <text start="1116.55" dur="5.4">attacking the US forces where the US is</text>
  <text start="1119.72" dur="5.44">arming this group and they don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="1121.95" dur="5.94">worry about Russia getting involved in</text>
  <text start="1125.16" dur="5.01">this and you can see this is part of</text>
  <text start="1127.89" dur="6.12">their strategy to keep the deep state</text>
  <text start="1130.17" dur="5.88">from breaking up Syria and if you look</text>
  <text start="1134.01" dur="4.35">you can see that this is exactly what is</text>
  <text start="1136.05" dur="4.44">happening right now and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1138.36" dur="4.47">have to see what the deep state does at</text>
  <text start="1140.49" dur="4.26">this point because you know this could</text>
  <text start="1142.83" dur="4.59">spark something else there could be some</text>
  <text start="1144.75" dur="5.37">type of false flag and we could end up</text>
  <text start="1147.42" dur="4.35">in war but it&amp;#39;s a strategy to stop all</text>
  <text start="1150.12" dur="4.5">of this from happening is it going to</text>
  <text start="1151.77" dur="5.84">work we don&amp;#39;t know but we can see right</text>
  <text start="1154.62" dur="6.24">now the deep state is on the run they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1157.61" dur="5.34">paid mercenary groups they are having a</text>
  <text start="1160.86" dur="5.93">huge amount of trouble maintaining</text>
  <text start="1162.95" dur="7.06">anything and their entire organization</text>
  <text start="1166.79" dur="5.41">and I&amp;#39;m talking about the terrorist</text>
  <text start="1170.01" dur="4.62">groups the deep state the intelligence</text>
  <text start="1172.2" dur="4.98">community it&amp;#39;s all falling apart right</text>
  <text start="1174.63" dur="4.26">in front of them and of course this is</text>
  <text start="1177.18" dur="3.9">going to take a little bit more time but</text>
  <text start="1178.89" dur="5.34">we can see right now that the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1181.08" dur="5.82">state has been removed out of Mosul it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1184.23" dur="6.06">being wiped out in Afghanistan it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1196.8" dur="4.65">off more and more of the funding well</text>
  <text start="1199.11" dur="3.18">guess what the deep state won&amp;#39;t be able</text>
