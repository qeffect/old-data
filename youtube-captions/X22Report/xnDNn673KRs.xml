  <text start="114.22" dur="4.29">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="116.02" dur="5.97">news now the Patriots they are working</text>
  <text start="118.51" dur="6.24">very very quickly to try to bring back</text>
  <text start="121.99" dur="6.15">as many jobs as possible to get</text>
  <text start="124.75" dur="5.61">businesses to invest in America instead</text>
  <text start="128.14" dur="4.34">of going overseas and this is why you</text>
  <text start="130.36" dur="6.24">see Trump creating these opportunities</text>
  <text start="132.48" dur="7.09">owns giving tax incentives because he</text>
  <text start="136.6" dur="6.66">knows he needs to bring back the jobs to</text>
  <text start="139.57" dur="5.639">all these areas and once he does this it</text>
  <text start="143.26" dur="4.819">will stimulate the rest of the country</text>
  <text start="145.209" dur="6.721">and that is his plan but he only has a</text>
  <text start="148.079" dur="5.621">short window to do this and remember the</text>
  <text start="151.93" dur="4.35">central bank&amp;#39;s the deep state they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="153.7" dur="5.879">been working for a very long time to</text>
  <text start="156.28" dur="5.549">strip America from manufacturing</text>
  <text start="159.579" dur="3.541">companies and things like that he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="161.829" dur="3.99">in office what</text>
  <text start="163.12" dur="4.679">two and a half years and he has to bring</text>
  <text start="165.819" dur="4.56">everything where much of it back as he</text>
  <text start="167.799" dur="4.621">possibly can before the entire central</text>
  <text start="170.379" dur="5.28">bank system falls apart remember we have</text>
  <text start="172.42" dur="5.7">two economies going on right now we have</text>
  <text start="175.659" dur="4.41">a central bank economy that is</text>
  <text start="178.12" dur="4.56">completely imploding on itself and then</text>
  <text start="180.069" dur="5.01">we have Trump who&amp;#39;s trying to create the</text>
  <text start="182.68" dur="4.919">people&amp;#39;s economy to benefit the people</text>
  <text start="185.079" dur="5.13">and he&amp;#39;s working as fast as he possibly</text>
  <text start="187.599" dur="4.92">can now I think he can work even faster</text>
  <text start="190.209" dur="4.471">but if we look at housing right now we</text>
  <text start="192.519" dur="4.05">can see that housing is completely</text>
  <text start="194.68" dur="5.639">imploding on itself housing starts in</text>
  <text start="196.569" dur="5.941">permits they tumbled in March housing</text>
  <text start="200.319" dur="4.651">starts fell around 0.3% month on month</text>
  <text start="202.51" dur="5.19">they were expected to rebound by five</text>
  <text start="204.97" dur="5.609">point four percent but it didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="207.7" dur="5.369">we see February&amp;#39;s eight point seven</text>
  <text start="210.579" dur="5.52">percent plunge was revised down to</text>
  <text start="213.069" dur="6.271">twelve percent I mean this is not good</text>
  <text start="216.099" dur="7.081">news here this is the weakest level of</text>
  <text start="219.34" dur="6.869">housing since May 2017 and the biggest</text>
  <text start="223.18" dur="6.66">year-to-year drop since 2011 and we see</text>
  <text start="226.209" dur="7.68">already that around the country we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="229.84" dur="6.989">seeing real estate completely implode on</text>
  <text start="233.889" dur="4.38">itself northeast down twenty-eight point</text>
  <text start="236.829" dur="4.231">twenty eight point three percent</text>
  <text start="238.269" dur="5.011">year-on-year Midwest down 28 percent</text>
  <text start="241.06" dur="6.48">South down four point one percent west</text>
  <text start="243.28" dur="6.98">down 19.5% permits were just as ugly</text>
  <text start="247.54" dur="5.759">dropping one point seven month on month</text>
  <text start="250.26" dur="6.039">this whole entire system&amp;#39;s imploding</text>
  <text start="253.299" dur="5.55">what does this mean this means Trump is</text>
  <text start="256.299" dur="5.041">going to come out and continually tell</text>
  <text start="258.849" dur="5.25">the Fed to cut rapes and I do believe</text>
  <text start="261.34" dur="5.31">that the Fed is going to have to cut</text>
  <text start="264.099" dur="5.161">rates now think about it the Fed is</text>
  <text start="266.65" dur="4.829">doing everything the opposite of what</text>
  <text start="269.26" dur="4.29">they planned on doing they planned on</text>
  <text start="271.479" dur="3.931">raising the rates now they&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="273.55" dur="4.85">holding pattern they planned on</text>
  <text start="275.41" dur="6.33">tightening now they&amp;#39;ve stopped that</text>
  <text start="278.4" dur="7.269">who&amp;#39;s in control here we know that Trump</text>
  <text start="281.74" dur="5.31">is and we need to understand what Trump</text>
  <text start="285.669" dur="4.891">and the Patriots are trying to do here</text>
  <text start="287.05" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re trying to bring back America</text>
  <text start="290.56" dur="4.759">actually trying to jumpstart America</text>
  <text start="292.87" dur="4.37">once again because</text>
  <text start="295.319" dur="5.671">we can see and as we look around we can</text>
  <text start="297.24" dur="7.44">see a lot of what was built here is</text>
  <text start="300.99" dur="7.47">completely stripped away and how do you</text>
  <text start="304.68" dur="5.789">bring back everything well number one</text>
  <text start="308.46" dur="5.159">you need to create these opportunities</text>
  <text start="310.469" dur="5.91">owns you need to deregulate you need to</text>
  <text start="313.619" dur="4.41">give incentives for corporations</text>
  <text start="316.379" dur="4.82">manufacturers to come back to the United</text>
  <text start="318.029" dur="5.64">States you have to give tax cuts to the</text>
  <text start="321.199" dur="4.39">American people so they have war in</text>
  <text start="323.669" dur="4.821">their pocket to spend their money now is</text>
  <text start="325.589" dur="6.06">this going to be enough will this allow</text>
  <text start="328.49" dur="5.379">the economy to move forward No</text>
  <text start="331.649" dur="5.82">and the reason for that is because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="333.869" dur="7.651">in a central bank system the debt load</text>
  <text start="337.469" dur="7.801">is way too heavy the American people are</text>
  <text start="341.52" dur="7.31">in an enormous amount of debt on credit</text>
  <text start="345.27" dur="8.459">cards with car payments mortgages and</text>
  <text start="348.83" dur="7.929">their wages are not going up Trump</text>
  <text start="353.729" dur="5.4">understands this he understands what</text>
  <text start="356.759" dur="5.52">needs to be done the stock market is not</text>
  <text start="359.129" dur="5.4">going to help the everyday American most</text>
  <text start="362.279" dur="5.28">Americans are not even in the stock</text>
  <text start="364.529" dur="7.021">market maybe they have some investment</text>
  <text start="367.559" dur="7.26">through retirement maybe their 401 K but</text>
  <text start="371.55" dur="5.399">most people they&amp;#39;re not even in the</text>
  <text start="374.819" dur="5.041">stock market and he knows this and he</text>
  <text start="376.949" dur="5.43">realizes that we are at the end stage of</text>
  <text start="379.86" dur="4.109">a central bank system remember in the</text>
  <text start="382.379" dur="4.62">beginning stage of a central bank system</text>
  <text start="383.969" dur="5.22">what do we see we we came off the gold</text>
  <text start="386.999" dur="5.07">standard and they were printing like</text>
  <text start="389.189" dur="4.53">crazy which meant there was more dollars</text>
  <text start="392.069" dur="4.89">in the system which meant we saw</text>
  <text start="393.719" dur="6.15">inflation which meant that everyone got</text>
  <text start="396.959" dur="4.77">a raise in the beginning everyone</text>
  <text start="399.869" dur="4.32">believed that this was a good thing oh</text>
  <text start="401.729" dur="5.49">wow my house went up from 10,000 to</text>
  <text start="404.189" dur="6.33">20,000 I was making 2,000 now making</text>
  <text start="407.219" dur="6.45">9000 yes it sounds fantastic</text>
  <text start="410.519" dur="7.32">but as the system goes past that point</text>
  <text start="413.669" dur="6.12">and reaches the end stage it all falls</text>
  <text start="417.839" dur="5.28">apart yes in the beginning everyone</text>
  <text start="419.789" dur="6.06">feels good but in the end everyone</text>
  <text start="423.119" dur="5.981">doesn&amp;#39;t and that&amp;#39;s where we are wages</text>
  <text start="425.849" dur="6.701">are not keeping up with the</text>
  <text start="429.1" dur="6.42">devaluing of the dollar and Trump</text>
  <text start="432.55" dur="4.41">realizes this and he realizes that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="435.52" dur="3.63">going to have to get rid of the central</text>
  <text start="436.96" dur="5.91">bank and restructure everything now</text>
  <text start="439.15" dur="7.11">remember Trump is actively stacking the</text>
  <text start="442.87" dur="5.4">bench at the Fed and he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="446.26" dur="4.26">bring in as we mentioned before herman</text>
  <text start="448.27" dur="5.15">cain and stephen moore now if it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="450.52" dur="6.36">these two it&amp;#39;s gonna be someone else and</text>
  <text start="453.42" dur="9.09">the players that he has already in the</text>
  <text start="456.88" dur="8.88">Fed they are on the same page as Trump</text>
  <text start="462.51" dur="5.71">he knows that a strong stock market</text>
  <text start="465.76" dur="4.62">isn&amp;#39;t enough especially for those with</text>
  <text start="468.22" dur="5.22">scant investments to benefit from the</text>
  <text start="470.38" dur="5.13">sp500 he knows that those people out in</text>
  <text start="473.44" dur="3.21">the Midwest and many other places they</text>
  <text start="475.51" dur="2.69">don&amp;#39;t have investments in the stock</text>
  <text start="476.65" dur="6.03">market that&amp;#39;s not going to help them</text>
  <text start="478.2" dur="7.54">what matters to most to them is wage</text>
  <text start="482.68" dur="6.06">growth so the people that he placed in</text>
  <text start="485.74" dur="8.55">the Fed they&amp;#39;re concerned about wage</text>
  <text start="488.74" dur="8.37">growth so who are these people that are</text>
  <text start="494.29" dur="7.92">in the Fed we have Randal querulous</text>
  <text start="497.11" dur="8.16">Richard clarita and Michelle Bauman four</text>
  <text start="502.21" dur="7.53">of the seven board seats are already</text>
  <text start="505.27" dur="8.76">filled by Trump appointees he wants</text>
  <text start="509.74" dur="8.07">stephen moore and herman cain and once</text>
  <text start="514.03" dur="8.16">he has all players in place what does</text>
  <text start="517.81" dur="8.76">that mean that means he has the seats</text>
  <text start="522.19" dur="8.55">filled he can move forward now and he</text>
  <text start="526.57" dur="7.07">realizes that he needs to go after the</text>
  <text start="530.74" dur="5.79">central bank and restructure it and</text>
  <text start="533.64" dur="6.31">allow the country to get back on its</text>
  <text start="536.53" dur="5.76">feet and we see already he&amp;#39;s making this</text>
  <text start="539.95" dur="5.31">move and this is why he nominated these</text>
  <text start="542.29" dur="6.39">two individuals and one&amp;#39;s a gold-bug one</text>
  <text start="545.26" dur="6.78">wants to rework the entire Fed Kaine is</text>
  <text start="548.68" dur="7.35">saying that we need new people inside of</text>
  <text start="552.04" dur="6.99">the Fed new ideas a different outlook</text>
  <text start="556.03" dur="6.72">and once all this comes together which</text>
  <text start="559.03" dur="7.049">it will everything is going to change</text>
  <text start="562.75" dur="6.089">just like we see it changing with the</text>
  <text start="566.079" dur="6.721">Muller report coming out with the Muller</text>
  <text start="568.839" dur="7.5">investigation ending since this has</text>
  <text start="572.8" dur="6.779">ended now the shackles are now off of</text>
  <text start="576.339" dur="4.381">Trump and the Patriots now of course yes</text>
  <text start="579.579" dur="3.661">the deep state they&amp;#39;re gonna try</text>
  <text start="580.72" dur="4.609">something else yes they&amp;#39;re gonna come up</text>
  <text start="583.24" dur="4.68">with some other type of investigation</text>
  <text start="585.329" dur="5.711">but all of that&amp;#39;s not going to work</text>
  <text start="587.92" dur="5.669">Trump and the Patriots now they have the</text>
  <text start="591.04" dur="6.649">ability to move full steam ahead now</text>
  <text start="593.589" dur="7.321">there are many blocks within Congress as</text>
  <text start="597.689" dur="6.4">we know and they will run into these</text>
  <text start="600.91" dur="5.4">blocks but I believe what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="604.089" dur="4.68">to do to get rid of these blocks is</text>
  <text start="606.31" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re going to use the D class and the</text>
  <text start="608.769" dur="5.31">OIG report and what I mean by this is</text>
  <text start="611.92" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;re going to remove those</text>
  <text start="614.079" dur="6.601">individuals that are stopping Trump in</text>
  <text start="617.98" dur="4.32">the Patriots from making America great</text>
  <text start="620.68" dur="4.529">again remember there are certain</text>
  <text start="622.3" dur="5.099">individuals that do not want the economy</text>
  <text start="625.209" dur="4.32">to do a lot better that do not want</text>
  <text start="627.399" dur="4.38">people to make more money that do not</text>
  <text start="629.529" dur="5.461">want the Federal Reserve to disappear</text>
  <text start="631.779" dur="6.06">there are many people who are corrupt</text>
  <text start="634.99" dur="5.55">within Congress that want to keep this</text>
  <text start="637.839" dur="4.141">system the way it is they don&amp;#39;t want it</text>
  <text start="640.54" dur="4.56">to end and they will fight to the very</text>
  <text start="641.98" dur="4.649">very end to keep it the way it is but</text>
  <text start="645.1" dur="4.02">this is not going to work and like I</text>
  <text start="646.629" dur="5.01">said a lot more blocks are gonna be</text>
  <text start="649.12" dur="5.73">taking down and once these blocks come</text>
  <text start="651.639" dur="6.151">down it will allow Trump and the</text>
  <text start="654.85" dur="6.83">Patriots to move forward think about why</text>
  <text start="657.79" dur="6.39">the Fed was never audited was it because</text>
  <text start="661.68" dur="5.529">they never really wanted to look into</text>
  <text start="664.18" dur="5.04">the Fed is it because that people really</text>
  <text start="667.209" dur="4.74">didn&amp;#39;t care about the Fed know there</text>
  <text start="669.22" dur="6.9">were certain individuals within Congress</text>
  <text start="671.949" dur="7.11">that were controlled by the deep State</text>
  <text start="676.12" dur="6.42">the central bank and told fight against</text>
  <text start="679.059" dur="4.65">any type of audit in the Fed and of</text>
  <text start="682.54" dur="3.359">course they didn&amp;#39;t want to order because</text>
  <text start="683.709" dur="5.041">they were making a lot of money off of</text>
  <text start="685.899" dur="6.42">the system once these people are</text>
  <text start="688.75" dur="6.33">completely removed and a new set of</text>
  <text start="692.319" dur="5.101">people come in who are not corrupt</text>
  <text start="695.08" dur="6.11">who are not taken over by the central</text>
