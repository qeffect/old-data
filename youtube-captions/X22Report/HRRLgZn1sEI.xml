  <text start="136.34" dur="6.38">something&amp;#39;s happening we see that the</text>
  <text start="140.56" dur="4.17">writing is on the wall and if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="142.72" dur="4.349">paying attention we know that the</text>
  <text start="144.73" dur="3.839">economy is not doing as well as the US</text>
  <text start="147.069" dur="4.441">government and the Fed wants us to</text>
  <text start="148.569" dur="5.401">believe and we are seeing this and this</text>
  <text start="151.51" dur="5.33">is out of Reuters we are seeing that</text>
  <text start="153.97" dur="6.32">they&amp;#39;re even reporting that US mortgage</text>
  <text start="156.84" dur="7.66">applications have slipped despite a</text>
  <text start="160.29" dur="6.699">slight dip in the interest rate and they</text>
  <text start="164.5" dur="6.319">were hoping that this slight dip would</text>
  <text start="166.989" dur="6.211">pump up more people to apply for</text>
  <text start="170.819" dur="4.42">mortgages but they&amp;#39;re seeing them</text>
  <text start="173.2" dur="4.08">actually decline and then we have to</text>
  <text start="175.239" dur="4.711">look back why is this happening well</text>
  <text start="177.28" dur="4.35">what do we know we know that the</text>
  <text start="179.95" dur="4.319">unemployment numbers from the Fed and</text>
  <text start="181.63" dur="4.59">the government are fake because they</text>
  <text start="184.269" dur="4.8">manipulated them recalculated them</text>
  <text start="186.22" dur="4.799">created a whole new formula forum and if</text>
  <text start="189.069" dur="3.511">we use the calculations prior to</text>
  <text start="191.019" dur="4.261">nineteen ninety-four we&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="192.58" dur="5.219">looking at a unemployment rate of 23%</text>
  <text start="195.28" dur="4.83">and they&amp;#39;re showing seven point four</text>
  <text start="197.799" dur="3.871">percent but then again they&amp;#39;re counting</text>
  <text start="200.11" dur="4.92">people who are working part-time as</text>
  <text start="201.67" dur="5.81">full-time and we realize that the United</text>
  <text start="205.03" dur="6.87">States is becoming a part time</text>
  <text start="207.48" dur="7.319">employment country and working part-time</text>
  <text start="211.9" dur="7.89">is not going to help you buy a home and</text>
  <text start="214.799" dur="7.201">this goes on to say that even though the</text>
  <text start="219.79" dur="4.949">interest rates took down a little bit</text>
  <text start="222" dur="7.18">mortgage applications are at their</text>
  <text start="224.739" dur="6.421">lowest level this month and they this</text>
  <text start="229.18" dur="4.61">article goes on to say that the gauge of</text>
  <text start="231.16" dur="7.38">loan requests for home purchases are a</text>
  <text start="233.79" dur="7.33">leading indicator of home sales and in</text>
  <text start="238.54" dur="5.61">my past report maybe it was two or three</text>
  <text start="241.12" dur="6.839">of them ago I reported that there is a</text>
  <text start="244.15" dur="6.089">lag of when sales will start declining</text>
  <text start="247.959" dur="5.941">because of course those people who are</text>
  <text start="250.239" dur="5.821">going out getting mortgages and since</text>
  <text start="253.9" dur="4.769">that is dipping it takes a little while</text>
  <text start="256.06" dur="5.27">for it to show up in the sales and in my</text>
  <text start="258.669" dur="5.821">report about two or three reports ago</text>
  <text start="261.33" dur="5.16">sales are starting to decrease and we</text>
  <text start="264.49" dur="5.489">saw this if you remember back in</text>
  <text start="266.49" dur="6.91">2007-2008 even prior to that where</text>
  <text start="269.979" dur="4.331">people were you know lines to buy a</text>
  <text start="273.4" dur="3.4">house you couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="274.31" dur="5.37">91 and then all of a sudden the market</text>
  <text start="276.8" dur="5.01">dried up and people had their houses on</text>
  <text start="279.68" dur="3.3">and I remember this I have a couple</text>
  <text start="281.81" dur="3.51">relatives that are in the real estate</text>
  <text start="282.98" dur="5.4">market and at the time I was actually</text>
  <text start="285.32" dur="7.26">trying to sell my house when the real</text>
  <text start="288.38" dur="6.39">estate market started to slow and people</text>
  <text start="292.58" dur="5.04">across the street from me we&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="294.77" dur="4.95">trying to sell and there was no one</text>
  <text start="297.62" dur="4.44">coming to the homes real estate people</text>
  <text start="299.72" dur="4.77">had no idea what was going on the real</text>
  <text start="302.06" dur="4.83">estate market started to slow and it</text>
  <text start="304.49" dur="4.5">just within a couple of weeks because</text>
  <text start="306.89" dur="5.16">there was a house that sold right next</text>
  <text start="308.99" dur="5.91">to mine and it was sold in like four</text>
  <text start="312.05" dur="5.07">days when it I mean it went up for sale</text>
  <text start="314.9" dur="4.5">and then four days later they had buyers</text>
  <text start="317.12" dur="4.14">and there was you know maybe 20 people</text>
  <text start="319.4" dur="5.25">coming to look at this house and maybe</text>
  <text start="321.26" dur="5.91">three or four months later in that year</text>
  <text start="324.65" dur="5.19">everything just dried up and then there</text>
  <text start="327.17" dur="5.22">was a lag because I have relatives in</text>
  <text start="329.84" dur="4.77">Florida who sold real estate and I asked</text>
  <text start="332.39" dur="4.56">them if they saw anything happening they</text>
  <text start="334.61" dur="5.16">said no the sales are strong but up in</text>
  <text start="336.95" dur="5.19">New York sales were lagging already and</text>
  <text start="339.77" dur="4.17">you see that difference and now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="342.14" dur="3.18">seeing the same thing happen where</text>
  <text start="343.94" dur="4.47">mortgage applications are starting to</text>
  <text start="345.32" dur="4.8">plunge sales we&amp;#39;re still going up and</text>
  <text start="348.41" dur="3.39">everyone&amp;#39;s reporting that everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="350.12" dur="3.66">great you know Obama was on his campaign</text>
  <text start="351.8" dur="3.84">telling everyone how great real estate</text>
  <text start="353.78" dur="4.11">is it&amp;#39;s on a rebound you see it all over</text>
  <text start="355.64" dur="4.08">the mainstream media and everything is</text>
  <text start="357.89" dur="5.22">fantastic unemployment&amp;#39;s coming down and</text>
  <text start="359.72" dur="9">this is the big build-up for what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.11" dur="11.79">coming this fall okay now there was a</text>
  <text start="368.72" dur="8.91">warning that in heathrow in London</text>
  <text start="374.9" dur="9.44">London&amp;#39;s Heathrow Airport that breast</text>
  <text start="377.63" dur="13.11">implant bombs are being reported I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="394.01" dur="9.69">the airport on high alert and this goes</text>
  <text start="398.96" dur="7.11">on to say that the UX UK experts said</text>
  <text start="403.7" dur="4.26">there is evidence that al-qaeda could go</text>
  <text start="406.07" dur="4.83">after flights out of London</text>
  <text start="407.96" dur="5.91">these implants are special officials</text>

  <text start="418.58" dur="4.32">their implants and I think we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="421.34" dur="4.77">getting a little out I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="422.9" dur="5.46">just struggling to make it seem like</text>
  <text start="426.11" dur="5.88">that everyone needs to be searched</text>
  <text start="428.36" dur="5.67">patted down controlled and you know the</text>
  <text start="431.99" dur="5.519">US government even came out that they</text>
  <text start="434.03" dur="6.419">know about this and this is why the TSA</text>

  <text start="440.449" dur="6.241">down people feeling them up taking</text>
  <text start="443.09" dur="4.859">control of the situation and that goes</text>
  <text start="446.69" dur="4.25">on to say that there is a real great</text>
  <text start="447.949" dur="6.121">fret front threat from al Qaeda and</text>
  <text start="450.94" dur="4.72">they&amp;#39;re you know they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="454.07" dur="5.189">worried because these bombs are</text>
  <text start="455.66" dur="5.939">undetectable and you know there might be</text>
  <text start="459.259" dur="5.701">something happening in any one of the</text>
  <text start="461.599" dur="5.641">airports anywhere throughout the world</text>
  <text start="464.96" dur="5.04">and everyone should be concerned about</text>
  <text start="467.24" dur="5.489">this and this seems like and who knows</text>
  <text start="470" dur="5.19">maybe something will happen but again we</text>

  <text start="486.5" dur="8.639">on Lebanon where the al-qaeda terrorists</text>

  <text start="547.889" dur="8.101">on a chat room seriously no they would</text>
  <text start="552.149" dur="7.021">do this with encrypted code or not even</text>

  <text start="559.17" dur="3.659">those type of communications so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="561.149" dur="3.961">full of it I mean that is the most</text>

  <text start="578.639" dur="7.531">al-qaeda is the threat and they had to</text>
  <text start="583.339" dur="6.43">put everyone on alert to make this look</text>
  <text start="586.17" dur="5.43">really serious and so this way the US</text>
  <text start="589.769" dur="4.17">government who is training thousands of</text>
  <text start="591.6" dur="5.37">soldiers with along with other countries</text>
  <text start="593.939" dur="5.101">to establish a no-fly zone in Syria</text>
  <text start="596.97" dur="4.26">which means boots on the ground but us</text>
  <text start="599.04" dur="4.2">can&amp;#39;t do it and they can&amp;#39;t send the</text>
  <text start="601.23" dur="4.5">soldiers in because Russia and China</text>
  <text start="603.24" dur="4.74">backs syria but it in the long run it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="605.73" dur="4.349">really not going to matter because if</text>
  <text start="607.98" dur="4.08">the central bankers don&amp;#39;t get their way</text>
  <text start="610.079" dur="5.641">and get the US dollar as a reserve</text>
  <text start="612.06" dur="6.06">currency in syria and iran they will</text>
  <text start="615.72" dur="9.15">start and go in there anyhow and we will</text>
  <text start="618.12" dur="9.449">have world war three now to prove that</text>

  <text start="639.689" dur="5.311">will show you that we haven&amp;#39;t done</text>
  <text start="641.88" dur="6.78">anything and it was the rebels and we</text>
  <text start="645" dur="5.16">know that something is building out in</text>
  <text start="648.66" dur="5.25">the Middle East because of all what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="650.16" dur="5.22">happening and also that Dempsey has come</text>
  <text start="653.91" dur="3.83">out the same we have to remember and I</text>
  <text start="655.38" dur="4.98">reported on this before that there was</text>
  <text start="657.74" dur="5.74">military assets being shipped over to</text>

  <text start="667.949" dur="7.161">because that the mission is to help the</text>
  <text start="672.75" dur="5.029">kingdom contain the fallout from Syria&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="675.11" dur="5.82">war and it would likely last four years</text>
