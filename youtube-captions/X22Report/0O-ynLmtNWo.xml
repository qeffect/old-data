  <text start="66.02" dur="5.46">economic collapse news now the central</text>
  <text start="68.51" dur="5.1">bankers they are nervous about what is</text>
  <text start="71.48" dur="4.5">going to happen remember their whole</text>
  <text start="73.61" dur="4.92">agenda is globalization their whole</text>
  <text start="75.98" dur="4.95">agenda is to place countries into debt</text>
  <text start="78.53" dur="4.98">their whole agenda is to spread debt and</text>
  <text start="80.93" dur="5.82">the only way they can do this is by</text>
  <text start="83.51" dur="6.57">getting people to take on more debt and</text>
  <text start="86.75" dur="6.36">this is why they lowered the auto loan</text>
  <text start="90.08" dur="5.55">to the subprime this is why mortgages</text>
  <text start="93.11" dur="6.18">they let in the subprime people and we</text>
  <text start="95.63" dur="6.75">know former President Barack Obama he</text>
  <text start="99.29" dur="7.29">was going to lower the fees in regards</text>
  <text start="102.38" dur="8.48">to the FHA mortgages and Trump came in</text>
  <text start="106.58" dur="8.039">and what he did was he shut it all down</text>
  <text start="110.86" dur="6.61">within an hour of being sworn in Trump</text>
  <text start="114.619" dur="5.191">undid one of Obama&amp;#39;s last minute actions</text>
  <text start="117.47" dur="4.44">a mortgage fee cut under a government</text>
  <text start="119.81" dur="5.52">program catering to first-time home</text>
  <text start="121.91" dur="5.25">buyers and low-income bars the cut which</text>
  <text start="125.33" dur="4.319">would become effective on January 27th</text>
  <text start="127.16" dur="6.24">would have reduced to the annual premium</text>
  <text start="129.649" dur="6.421">for someone borrowing $200,000 by $500</text>
  <text start="133.4" dur="5.55">in the first year however this would</text>
  <text start="136.07" dur="6.84">expose taxpayers to further losses if</text>
  <text start="138.95" dur="7.14">there was a spike in defaults and we</text>
  <text start="142.91" dur="6.03">know that this is coming we know that</text>
  <text start="146.09" dur="5.28">the housing market well it hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="148.94" dur="5.16">recovered like they&amp;#39;re telling us the</text>
  <text start="151.37" dur="7.17">housing market right now has been built</text>
  <text start="154.1" dur="8.61">up on phony data it has built up on free</text>
  <text start="158.54" dur="6.54">money and it is one gigantic bubble now</text>
  <text start="162.71" dur="4.77">very interestingly we can see that the</text>
  <text start="165.08" dur="6.66">central bankers they are preparing to</text>
  <text start="167.48" dur="6.78">blame everything on Trump now again I</text>
  <text start="171.74" dur="5.16">don&amp;#39;t care who the president is</text>
  <text start="174.26" dur="5.46">the president is really not calling the</text>
  <text start="176.9" dur="5.34">shots it&amp;#39;s really the central bank the</text>
  <text start="179.72" dur="4.74">shadow government behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="182.24" dur="4.23">now they&amp;#39;re going to try to control</text>
  <text start="184.46" dur="3.78">Trump right now and we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="186.47" dur="6.69">how Trump reacts does he play ball with</text>
  <text start="188.24" dur="8.16">them or does he go against them now just</text>
  <text start="193.16" dur="5.28">for our information so when the economy</text>
  <text start="196.4" dur="3.21">starts to fall apart because we know</text>
  <text start="198.44" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s going to happen we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="199.61" dur="7.32">gonna be blaming it on Trump we can see</text>
  <text start="202.55" dur="7.68">that world trade actually has increased</text>
  <text start="206.93" dur="7.32">by less than 1% annually in the last</text>
  <text start="210.23" dur="9.21">decade so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="214.25" dur="6.39">that world trade well it hasn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="219.44" dur="5.7">gone anywhere</text>
  <text start="220.64" dur="7.89">now according to the C P B world trade</text>
  <text start="225.14" dur="7.43">monitor the value of world exports has</text>
  <text start="228.53" dur="8.61">increased by 1% less than 1% annually</text>
  <text start="232.57" dur="7.75">making a high on July 31st 2007 compared</text>
  <text start="237.14" dur="6.63">to more than a 5 percent annualized</text>
  <text start="240.32" dur="6.24">growth rate since 1991 even with</text>
  <text start="243.77" dur="4.98">extraordinary global monetary easing in</text>
  <text start="246.56" dur="5.88">the post-financial crisis world world</text>
  <text start="248.75" dur="6.54">trade has been unable to find the extra</text>
  <text start="252.44" dur="5.85">gear it hit during the pre-crisis error</text>
  <text start="255.29" dur="6.09">so the next time the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="258.29" dur="6.23">The Economist&amp;#39;s everyone else starts to</text>
  <text start="261.38" dur="5.46">blame Trump for collapsing world trade</text>
  <text start="264.52" dur="4.27">everyone needs to look back in time to</text>
  <text start="266.84" dur="5.76">say well wait a minute it was already</text>
  <text start="268.79" dur="5.4">less than 1% we didn&amp;#39;t hit 5% we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="272.6" dur="4.98">hit anything actually it&amp;#39;s a complete</text>
  <text start="274.19" dur="4.98">disaster and we know this is what</text>
  <text start="277.58" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re going this is what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="279.17" dur="8.27">to do now very interestingly we know</text>
  <text start="282.86" dur="7.83">that the UK we know that Italy France</text>
  <text start="287.44" dur="4.63">they all want to leave the EU and we</text>
  <text start="290.69" dur="4.02">know the central bankers are going to</text>
  <text start="292.07" dur="5.73">give these countries a very tough time</text>
  <text start="294.71" dur="4.8">even if the people vote for it we know</text>
  <text start="297.8" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re coming up with a way to try to</text>
  <text start="299.51" dur="3.27">stop this now we know the UK it looks</text>
  <text start="301.88" dur="3.57">like they&amp;#39;re gonna try to implement</text>
  <text start="302.78" dur="4.89">article 50 come this March and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="305.45" dur="7.56">already getting word from Mario Draghi</text>
  <text start="307.67" dur="8.279">and they have a plan to how to stop this</text>
  <text start="313.01" dur="8.32">entire thing what are they going to do</text>
  <text start="315.949" dur="9.821">four countries to leave the EU they must</text>
  <text start="321.33" dur="7.86">first settle their debts with the bloc&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.77" dur="6.869">target to payment system before severing</text>
  <text start="329.19" dur="6.21">ties he said if a country were to leave</text>
  <text start="332.639" dur="5.671">the euro system its natural its national</text>
  <text start="335.4" dur="5.6">central banks claims on or liabilities</text>
  <text start="338.31" dur="8.37">to the ECB would need to be settled in</text>
  <text start="341" dur="7.59">full he did not specify in what currency</text>
  <text start="346.68" dur="5.16">the settlement would have to take place</text>
  <text start="348.59" dur="5.259">it was also not clear just what the ECB</text>
  <text start="351.84" dur="5.19">would do in response if a country did</text>
  <text start="353.849" dur="7.681">not settle its claims and remember the</text>
  <text start="357.03" dur="7.169">ECB wanted a police force their own army</text>
  <text start="361.53" dur="4.56">I mean was this the reason that they</text>
  <text start="364.199" dur="4.021">wanted this but we can see already</text>
  <text start="366.09" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re telling the countries like you</text>
  <text start="368.22" dur="3.6">can&amp;#39;t leave this you need to pay your</text>
  <text start="369.57" dur="4.939">debt and most of these countries they</text>
  <text start="371.82" dur="6.379">can&amp;#39;t do it now the IMF is out there and</text>
  <text start="374.509" dur="6.311">they&amp;#39;re warning that there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="378.199" dur="5.44">disruptions in the global economy in</text>
  <text start="380.82" dur="6.089">2017 now remember we went back in time</text>
  <text start="383.639" dur="6.721">and we saw what the world global trade</text>
  <text start="386.909" dur="5.82">was like and it hasn&amp;#39;t really gone over</text>
  <text start="390.36" dur="5.429">one percent it&amp;#39;s a disaster it never</text>
  <text start="392.729" dur="6.151">returned to the pre-crisis percentage</text>
  <text start="395.789" dur="6.091">and now the IMF is out there telling</text>
  <text start="398.88" dur="5.009">everyone that things don&amp;#39;t look good for</text>
  <text start="401.88" dur="4.469">what is coming and this is some of their</text>
  <text start="403.889" dur="4.71">concerns some of the concerns of</text>
  <text start="406.349" dur="4.651">spillover is produced by the policies of</text>
  <text start="408.599" dur="6.091">Donald Trump administration in the US</text>
  <text start="411" dur="6.27">and the brexit in the UK might</text>
  <text start="414.69" dur="5.34">eventually come true producing a net</text>
  <text start="417.27" dur="5.7">negative outcome for the world economy</text>
  <text start="420.03" dur="4.949">overall and the reshaping of the global</text>
  <text start="422.97" dur="5.789">economic landscape might turn out to be</text>
  <text start="424.979" dur="6">very painful so they&amp;#39;re already setting</text>
  <text start="428.759" dur="4.5">this up because they know what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="430.979" dur="5.43">to happen they&amp;#39;re going to bring down</text>
  <text start="433.259" dur="5.22">the economy at a certain point in time</text>
  <text start="436.409" dur="4.531">and they&amp;#39;re gonna shift the blame now</text>
  <text start="438.479" dur="3.81">Donald Trump on the other hand he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="440.94" dur="4.409">gonna be trying to shift the blame to</text>
  <text start="442.289" dur="3.711">the central bank we have a war going on</text>
  <text start="445.349" dur="3.961">right now</text>
  <text start="446" dur="5.14">between two systems</text>
  <text start="449.31" dur="4.95">the private West a central bank system</text>
  <text start="451.14" dur="5.37">and those who are trying to get rid of</text>
  <text start="454.26" dur="5.34">the Central Bank and the central bankers</text>
  <text start="456.51" dur="5.31">well they don&amp;#39;t like this Trump has also</text>
  <text start="459.6" dur="5.01">signed an executive order to ease the</text>
  <text start="461.82" dur="7.29">burden of Obamacare as we transition</text>
  <text start="464.61" dur="7.77">from Obamacare to a new health insurance</text>
  <text start="469.11" dur="4.74">and right now they haven&amp;#39;t announced</text>
  <text start="472.38" dur="5.33">what the new health insurance is going</text>
  <text start="473.85" dur="7.29">to be now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="477.71" dur="6.19">that the spokesperson for Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="481.14" dur="6.39">Sean Spicer came out and he chastised</text>
  <text start="483.9" dur="5.76">the US media outlets accusing reporters</text>
  <text start="487.53" dur="3.9">of under stating the numbers of</text>
  <text start="489.66" dur="4.5">supporters present during the</text>
  <text start="491.43" dur="4.56">inauguration and people are all over the</text>
  <text start="494.16" dur="4.2">show some media saying oh my god what</text>
  <text start="495.99" dur="4.11">babies I can&amp;#39;t believe it and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="498.36" dur="4.76">pictures all over the social media</text>
  <text start="500.1" dur="6.57">comparing 2009 Obama inauguration and</text>
  <text start="503.12" dur="4.72">2017 Trump inauguration and you can see</text>
  <text start="506.67" dur="3.96">and when you look at him you&amp;#39;re like oh</text>
  <text start="507.84" dur="6.27">my God look at these pictures we see a</text>
  <text start="510.63" dur="6.09">huge crowd with Obama and nobody showing</text>
  <text start="514.11" dur="6.72">up for Trump now when we look at these</text>
  <text start="516.72" dur="7.05">pictures we have to understand when were</text>
  <text start="520.83" dur="5.07">they taking were they taking at the same</text>
  <text start="523.77" dur="5.25">exact time when both were given the</text>
  <text start="525.9" dur="7.74">speech no the picture that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="529.02" dur="8.57">showing is when people were arriving for</text>
  <text start="533.64" dur="7.83">Trump&amp;#39;s inauguration now the Atlantic</text>
  <text start="537.59" dur="6.04">they have a timeline of different</text>
  <text start="541.47" dur="4.74">pictures and they show this and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="543.63" dur="5.22">a caption underneath that says people</text>
  <text start="546.21" dur="4.76">are gathering for the inauguration now</text>
  <text start="548.85" dur="5.04">this is the picture they&amp;#39;re using and</text>
  <text start="550.97" dur="5.59">this is what Donald Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="553.89" dur="5.73">administration is talking about this is</text>
  <text start="556.56" dur="6.18">not apples to apples they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="559.62" dur="5.19">comparing the same thing because when</text>
  <text start="562.74" dur="5.61">you look at a different picture of one</text>
  <text start="564.81" dur="7.56">Trump is actually giving his speech well</text>
  <text start="568.35" dur="5.28">the crowd looks very different now we</text>
  <text start="572.37" dur="3.06">could take this a step further and</text>
  <text start="573.63" dur="6">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="575.43" dur="6.12">they didn&amp;#39;t show any other aerial view</text>
  <text start="579.63" dur="3.45">except for this one I mean all</text>
  <text start="581.55" dur="4.83">throughout the inauguration you think</text>
  <text start="583.08" dur="5.25">maybe snapping aerial shots but if you</text>
  <text start="586.38" dur="8.37">notice they&amp;#39;re very difficult to find</text>
  <text start="588.33" dur="10.08">but CNN has a giggle pixel camera that</text>
  <text start="594.75" dur="8.1">they used and you can zoom in on the</text>
  <text start="598.41" dur="7.35">crowd and you can see this as we zoom in</text>
  <text start="602.85" dur="4.17">and you go far back all the way very</text>
  <text start="605.76" dur="4.35">close to where the Washington Monument</text>
  <text start="607.02" dur="6.39">you can see the crowd is all there and</text>
  <text start="610.11" dur="5.04">then when you look to the left you can</text>
  <text start="613.41" dur="4.86">see the crowd and when you look to the</text>
  <text start="615.15" dur="7.68">right you can see the crowd and you can</text>
  <text start="618.27" dur="6.21">go to CNN I&amp;#39;ll put the URL on the x-22</text>
  <text start="622.83" dur="5.64">report comm site if you&amp;#39;re on YouTube</text>
  <text start="624.48" dur="5.97">you can see the camera and I&amp;#39;m zooming</text>
  <text start="628.47" dur="4.68">in on each of the area so you can see</text>
  <text start="630.45" dur="3.87">what the crowd actually looks like and</text>
  <text start="633.15" dur="4.02">this is what they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="634.32" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re saying you&amp;#39;re not being honest</text>
  <text start="637.17" dur="4.11">in what you&amp;#39;re reporting now the numbers</text>
  <text start="639.96" dur="3.21">are completely different because people</text>
  <text start="641.28" dur="3.96">are not looking at the numbers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="643.17" dur="3.93">looking at the pictures and yes the</text>
  <text start="645.24" dur="3.93">numbers aren&amp;#39;t important and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="647.1" dur="5.31">saying each one of these sections well</text>
  <text start="649.17" dur="5.19">they held about 200,000 or so people but</text>
  <text start="652.41" dur="4.14">what people see and it&amp;#39;s all over</text>
  <text start="654.36" dur="3.99">Facebook it&amp;#39;s all over the news New York</text>
  <text start="656.55" dur="4.14">Times is carrying a C and then all of</text>
  <text start="658.35" dur="6.18">them are or have this picture but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="660.69" dur="7.04">not an honest picture now the other</text>
  <text start="664.53" dur="7.05">thing they were talking about is that</text>
  <text start="667.73" dur="6.43">Trump wanted to use Frank Sinatra&amp;#39;s song</text>
  <text start="671.58" dur="4.17">during his inauguration and they said</text>
  <text start="674.16" dur="5.1">that Nancy Sinatra and this is coming</text>
  <text start="675.75" dur="6.9">from CNN well she was very unhappy about</text>
  <text start="679.26" dur="7.65">this she didn&amp;#39;t want Trump using it well</text>
  <text start="682.65" dur="6.75">Nancy Sinatra came out and she said that</text>
  <text start="686.91" dur="6.69">is not true I never said that</text>
  <text start="689.4" dur="6.81">why do you lie CNN so already we see</text>
  <text start="693.6" dur="5.01">that they&amp;#39;re not really being honest in</text>
  <text start="696.21" dur="6.83">what they&amp;#39;re saying now to take this a</text>
  <text start="698.61" dur="8.7">step further we see there was a YMCA in</text>
  <text start="703.04" dur="6.7">Indiana they stopped airing CNN on its</text>
  <text start="707.31" dur="6.12">television because the people inside of</text>
  <text start="709.74" dur="4.56">the Y said that guess what this is fake</text>
  <text start="713.43" dur="3.55">they&amp;#39;re lying</text>
  <text start="714.3" dur="6.01">we can&amp;#39;t have this on</text>
  <text start="716.98" dur="6.12">the TVs while we work out so the people</text>
  <text start="720.31" dur="4.92">actually said you know something we</text>
  <text start="723.1" dur="7.56">don&amp;#39;t want to see CNN anymore please</text>
  <text start="725.23" dur="8.729">change the channel now a day after Trump</text>
  <text start="730.66" dur="6.119">was inaugurated we had the woman in the</text>
  <text start="733.959" dur="5.19">world March and they were supposed to be</text>

  <text start="942.1" dur="5.01">for something completely different</text>
  <text start="943.48" dur="7.109">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="947.11" dur="7.05">the corporate media George Soros they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="950.589" dur="6.541">still pushing their agenda they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="954.16" dur="6.27">pushing it and you know it&amp;#39;s funny where</text>
  <text start="957.13" dur="5.64">were all these individuals before I mean</text>
  <text start="960.43" dur="4.95">they were asking for equal pay with men</text>
  <text start="962.77" dur="4.8">which everyone should have the same pay</text>
  <text start="965.38" dur="4.92">if you do the job and you do it well you</text>
  <text start="967.57" dur="5.49">should get paid the same where were they</text>
  <text start="970.3" dur="5.7">a year ago why wasn&amp;#39;t the March done</text>
  <text start="973.06" dur="5.64">then where were they two years ago all</text>
  <text start="976" dur="6.3">I&amp;#39;m saying is that the timing is very</text>
  <text start="978.7" dur="6.119">interesting a day after a president that</text>
  <text start="982.3" dur="5.099">was inaugurated all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="984.819" dur="5.401">there was a March and most of the signs</text>
  <text start="987.399" dur="6.93">were anti-trump most of the signs were</text>
  <text start="990.22" dur="6.449">not really in what they were saying and</text>
  <text start="994.329" dur="5.91">what they were doing and the timing is</text>
  <text start="996.669" dur="6.09">very suspicious now another thing that</text>
  <text start="1000.239" dur="5.4">Trump has done which I find very</text>
  <text start="1002.759" dur="6.66">suspicious is that after his</text>
  <text start="1005.639" dur="6">inauguration a White House website laid</text>
  <text start="1009.419" dur="3.63">out a series of new policy positions</text>
  <text start="1011.639" dur="3.51">including a promise to develop a</text>
  <text start="1013.049" dur="5.13">state-of-the-art missile defense system</text>
  <text start="1015.149" dur="5.761">to protect against both Iran and North</text>
  <text start="1018.179" dur="5.34">Korea and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="1020.91" dur="5.759">this is that he&amp;#39;s looking to develop a</text>
  <text start="1023.519" dur="5.49">completely new missile system to point</text>
  <text start="1026.669" dur="5.37">towards North Korea and replace the old</text>
  <text start="1029.009" dur="5.88">one that&amp;#39;s pointing to Iran which is</text>
  <text start="1032.039" dur="5.25">actually pointing to Russia with a new</text>
  <text start="1034.889" dur="6.981">one and we know that he wanted to cut</text>
  <text start="1037.289" dur="6.8">expenses he wanted to cut the budgets</text>
  <text start="1041.87" dur="5.74">but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="1044.089" dur="6.67">this is a pricy missile defense system</text>
  <text start="1047.61" dur="4.919">so it doesn&amp;#39;t jive and what he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="1050.759" dur="5.76">and this should make everyone nervous</text>
  <text start="1052.529" dur="8.551">again why is he placing these things out</text>
  <text start="1056.519" dur="6.87">there who&amp;#39;s behind all of this and what</text>
  <text start="1061.08" dur="6.78">are they trying to do because we can see</text>
  <text start="1063.389" dur="7.111">that there have been troops tanks moved</text>
  <text start="1067.86" dur="5.46">all around the world in Europe out in</text>
  <text start="1070.5" dur="5.129">the Pacific the Middle East and we know</text>
  <text start="1073.32" dur="5.699">that these individuals the central bank</text>
  <text start="1075.629" dur="6.741">the neocons they want to push war with</text>
  <text start="1079.019" dur="5.52">Russia they haven&amp;#39;t given up on this and</text>
  <text start="1082.37" dur="3.97">they&amp;#39;re going to continually try to do</text>
  <text start="1084.539" dur="3.6">this I mean we already see in the korver</text>
  <text start="1086.34" dur="4.589">media which will report on a couple days</text>
  <text start="1088.139" dur="4.441">ago how they were talking about how war</text>
  <text start="1090.929" dur="3.74">is going to play out and most likely</text>
  <text start="1092.58" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s going to start out in Latvia and</text>
  <text start="1094.669" dur="5.411">they were trying to come up with this</text>
  <text start="1096.75" dur="5.49">whole scenario how how Putin actually is</text>
  <text start="1100.08" dur="3.959">going to start World War 3 because he</text>
  <text start="1102.24" dur="4.289">already invaded Ukraine and now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1104.039" dur="4.26">going to do this also in the Baltics so</text>
  <text start="1106.529" dur="3.961">they&amp;#39;re really pushing this and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1108.299" dur="4.921">pushing it hard and we know this is</text>
  <text start="1110.49" dur="5.46">completely untrue once again now we see</text>
  <text start="1113.22" dur="5.439">chief advisor of the turkish President</text>
  <text start="1115.95" dur="4.63">Erdogan well they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="1118.659" dur="6">and they&amp;#39;re still calling for buffer</text>
  <text start="1120.58" dur="6.899">zones for refugees in Syria and they</text>
  <text start="1124.659" dur="4.14">want these buffer zones set up and what</text>
  <text start="1127.479" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re saying is that the coalition</text>
  <text start="1128.799" dur="4.83">forces would protect the people fleeing</text>
  <text start="1131.289" dur="3.931">the war in these areas and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1133.629" dur="4.65">control the area so they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="1135.22" dur="5.009">pushing for this we see that the US and</text>
  <text start="1138.279" dur="5.421">Turkey well they&amp;#39;re setting up new</text>
  <text start="1140.229" dur="8.19">military bases in Aleppo and hosaka in</text>
  <text start="1143.7" dur="6.699">northern Syria and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1148.419" dur="3.36">right now is that they&amp;#39;re setting these</text>
  <text start="1150.399" dur="3.09">up and they&amp;#39;re continually doing this</text>
  <text start="1151.779" dur="4.411">now once again this is a sovereign</text>
  <text start="1153.489" dur="4.32">country turkey should be not you should</text>
  <text start="1156.19" dur="3.239">not be setting up military bases the</text>
  <text start="1157.809" dur="3.54">United States should not be setting up</text>
  <text start="1159.429" dur="4.47">military bases and what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1161.349" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;re setting these up so it makes it</text>
  <text start="1163.899" dur="8.311">easier for the u.s. to bring in air</text>
  <text start="1167.379" dur="7.68">cargos with arms into the area which is</text>
  <text start="1172.21" dur="5.429">completely unbelievable because syria</text>
  <text start="1175.059" dur="5.661">has not invited the United States or</text>
  <text start="1177.639" dur="5.071">turkey for that matter into Syria and</text>
  <text start="1180.72" dur="7.179">they didn&amp;#39;t give them permission to</text>
  <text start="1182.71" dur="7.26">create bases and allow cargo planes to</text>
  <text start="1187.899" dur="6.12">land in the area so they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1189.97" dur="5.939">something completely different now we</text>
  <text start="1194.019" dur="3.78">can see that the u.s. well they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1195.909" dur="4.95">going to be sending a special delegation</text>
  <text start="1197.799" dur="4.62">to the Syrian talks right now and the</text>
  <text start="1200.859" dur="4.17">reason given from the State Department</text>
  <text start="1202.419" dur="5.49">is that because there is a transition</text>
  <text start="1205.029" dur="5.73">going on right now and the inauguration</text>
  <text start="1207.909" dur="4.89">was just held and it looks like at this</text>
  <text start="1210.759" dur="3.961">point they don&amp;#39;t have the ability to</text>
  <text start="1212.799" dur="4.08">send anyone over there so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1214.72" dur="4.199">going to do instead is they&amp;#39;re gonna let</text>
  <text start="1216.879" dur="6.36">the u.s. be represented by its</text>
  <text start="1218.919" dur="4.74">ambassador to Kazakhstan so we see right</text>
  <text start="1223.239" dur="3.68">now</text>
  <text start="1223.659" dur="6.45">they&amp;#39;re prepping for the Ambassador to</text>
  <text start="1226.919" dur="4.541">join in with these talks and we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="1230.109" dur="3.981">to see what happens but we need to</text>
  <text start="1231.46" dur="5.909">remember something very very important</text>
  <text start="1234.09" dur="5.589">nothing is done we&amp;#39;re not out of the</text>
  <text start="1237.369" dur="4.02">woods at all actually things are</text>
  <text start="1239.679" dur="3.99">building up right now because what we</text>
  <text start="1241.389" dur="4.98">see happening is that the central bank</text>
  <text start="1243.669" dur="5.281">the shadow government well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1246.369" dur="4.86">butting heads with what Trump is trying</text>
  <text start="1248.95" dur="3.54">to do now Trump we don&amp;#39;t know what side</text>
  <text start="1251.229" dur="3.061">he&amp;#39;s on yet yeah</text>
  <text start="1252.49" dur="3.99">he&amp;#39;s in the white house we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1254.29" dur="5.01">which way he&amp;#39;s going he is keeping his</text>
  <text start="1256.48" dur="6.9">promises on certain things but we can</text>
  <text start="1259.3" dur="6.47">see right now from the IMF from the ECB</text>
  <text start="1263.38" dur="5.97">that they&amp;#39;re going to make it very tough</text>
  <text start="1265.77" dur="5.35">for countries to leave we see that the</text>
  <text start="1269.35" dur="5.25">IMF is already saying that things are</text>
  <text start="1271.12" dur="5.25">going to be turning down in 2017 because</text>
  <text start="1274.6" dur="3.66">what&amp;#39;s happening with Trump and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1276.37" dur="3.689">happening with the brexit and other</text>
  <text start="1278.26" dur="4.2">countries that want to leave we already</text>
  <text start="1280.059" dur="4.561">see Janet Yellen out there well she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1282.46" dur="4.41">saying that the labor market is not</text>
  <text start="1284.62" dur="5.76">going as well as they thought it was and</text>
  <text start="1286.87" dur="6.03">it looks like hiring is slowing so right</text>
  <text start="1290.38" dur="4.77">now they&amp;#39;re really building this up and</text>
  <text start="1292.9" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re going to they&amp;#39;re getting ready</text>
  <text start="1295.15" dur="5.7">to shift the blame they&amp;#39;re laying the</text>
  <text start="1297.67" dur="5.82">groundwork of preparing the narrative of</text>
  <text start="1300.85" dur="4.59">why the economy all of a sudden is not</text>
  <text start="1303.49" dur="4.71">doing well and this is why we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1305.44" dur="5.79">tracking everything because this should</text>
  <text start="1308.2" dur="4.65">not come as a surprise when all of a</text>
  <text start="1311.23" dur="3.24">sudden the economy comes down because</text>
  <text start="1312.85" dur="2.88">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the economy we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1314.47" dur="5.43">been looking at the hard facts and this</text>
  <text start="1315.73" dur="6.48">is why I talked about the world global</text>
  <text start="1319.9" dur="3.63">trade and how it has gone nowhere</text>
  <text start="1322.21" dur="3.87">actually it has declined</text>
  <text start="1323.53" dur="5.79">we went from 5% to under 1% and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1326.08" dur="4.83">never improved since 2008 so we can see</text>
  <text start="1329.32" dur="3.32">right now from all the numbers that</text>
  <text start="1330.91" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;ve been discussing that things</text>
  <text start="1332.64" dur="3.55">haven&amp;#39;t gotten any better actually</text>
  <text start="1334.54" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;ve gotten a lot worse and the only</text>
  <text start="1336.19" dur="4.8">reason it looks better is because of all</text>
  <text start="1338.59" dur="4.5">the free money that the central banks</text>
  <text start="1340.99" dur="4.02">have pumped in it&amp;#39;s because of all the</text>
