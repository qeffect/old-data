  <text start="39.87" dur="7.38">Cyprus event was completely planned and</text>
  <text start="43.199" dur="7.921">it was completely set up to see what</text>
  <text start="47.25" dur="6.239">would happen according to this FDIC</text>
  <text start="51.12" dur="5.73">document and the Bank of England</text>
  <text start="53.489" dur="7.59">document that the messenger pointed out</text>
  <text start="56.85" dur="7.98">on the people this was already planned</text>
  <text start="61.079" dur="7.801">and ready to move forward they needed a</text>
  <text start="64.83" dur="7.2">test case and Cyprus was the test case</text>
  <text start="68.88" dur="5.61">but we&amp;#39;re going to discuss the document</text>

  <text start="74.49" dur="4.41">safe in the bank or can we expect the</text>
  <text start="77.28" dur="8.49">same thing to happen that happened in</text>
  <text start="78.9" dur="9.42">Cyprus but the people the form the</text>
  <text start="85.77" dur="9.239">people is great because the messenger</text>
  <text start="88.32" dur="9.089">pointed this out and I read it and I</text>
  <text start="95.009" dur="5.21">couldn&amp;#39;t believe what it said and it</text>
  <text start="97.409" dur="7.441">what&amp;#39;s great about the people is that</text>
  <text start="100.219" dur="7.33">not just one not just two but thousands</text>
  <text start="104.85" dur="5.22">of people can be scouring they could</text>
  <text start="107.549" dur="5.67">note you can know someone someone can be</text>
  <text start="110.07" dur="5.79">in law enforcement DHS the army the Navy</text>
  <text start="113.219" dur="4.531">the Marines higher-ups you could be</text>
  <text start="115.86" dur="5.13">getting information from all of these</text>
  <text start="117.75" dur="6.95">people bringing this information to the</text>
  <text start="120.99" dur="6.21">people and letting others see this and</text>
  <text start="124.7" dur="5.86">spreading the word before the mainstream</text>
  <text start="127.2" dur="6.72">media can even say anything about these</text>
  <text start="130.56" dur="5.97">things and as more people see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="133.92" dur="4.5">going on and becoming awake they can see</text>
  <text start="136.53" dur="3.37">that the mainstream media is not telling</text>
  <text start="138.42" dur="3.159">them the entire truth</text>
  <text start="139.9" dur="4.08">we&amp;#39;re not the truth at all and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="141.579" dur="5.481">what&amp;#39;s so great about the people but</text>
  <text start="143.98" dur="5.759">let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s go and get started today and</text>
  <text start="147.06" dur="6.039">we see President Obama out there pushing</text>
  <text start="149.739" dur="6.981">his gun control laws and you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="153.099" dur="7.081">going to bring the children on the his</text>
  <text start="156.72" dur="6.219">Air Force One he&amp;#39;s gonna climb to</text>
  <text start="160.18" dur="6.72">Washington I mean he is really pulling</text>
  <text start="162.939" dur="7.83">out everything and anything to get this</text>
  <text start="166.9" dur="7.02">gun legislation passed and he says he is</text>
  <text start="170.769" dur="5.821">determined as ever for this gun bill but</text>
  <text start="173.92" dur="4.23">you know he took an oath to the Second</text>
  <text start="176.59" dur="3.84">Amendment actually he took most of the</text>
  <text start="178.15" dur="5.669">Constitution and the Second Amendment is</text>
  <text start="180.43" dur="6.899">included in this that he would upheld</text>
  <text start="183.819" dur="6.75">and protect but he is not doing that and</text>
  <text start="187.329" dur="5.91">many others are not doing this and I</text>
  <text start="190.569" dur="5.31">hate to keep going over this but the</text>
  <text start="193.239" dur="6.03">right of the people to keep and bear</text>
  <text start="195.879" dur="7.14">Arms shall not be infringed again then</text>
  <text start="199.269" dur="5.851">the word bear to carry arms weapons</text>
  <text start="203.019" dur="5.06">ammunition armaments which the</text>
  <text start="205.12" dur="6.78">definition of that is military weapons</text>
  <text start="208.079" dur="6.88">infringe means to limit to undermine to</text>
  <text start="211.9" dur="7.35">encroach on every single law that</text>
  <text start="214.959" dur="8.42">they&amp;#39;re doing right now limits undermine</text>
  <text start="219.25" dur="8.129">or encroaches on so I don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="223.379" dur="9.271">anybody could say that these laws are</text>
  <text start="227.379" dur="11.64">okay these laws are null and void</text>
  <text start="232.65" dur="10.78">according to the Second Amendment now I</text>
  <text start="239.019" dur="7.14">know we talked about cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="243.43" dur="4.589">before and I know I brought this up many</text>
  <text start="246.159" dur="4.621">many episodes and I&amp;#39;m just going to</text>
  <text start="248.019" dur="5.37">bring it up again because there have</text>
  <text start="250.78" dur="5.069">been another couple of reports and every</text>
  <text start="253.389" dur="5.22">time I see more and more reports come</text>
  <text start="255.849" dur="5.371">out it they&amp;#39;re moving towards something</text>
  <text start="258.609" dur="6.541">they&amp;#39;re letting us know this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.22" dur="5.52">going to happen now in this report the</text>
  <text start="265.15" dur="7.29">US will be crushed by state-sponsored</text>
  <text start="266.74" dur="6.84">cyber attack one security CEO now in</text>
  <text start="272.44" dur="2.49">this report their say</text>
  <text start="273.58" dur="3.709">that North Korea is threatening to</text>
  <text start="274.93" dur="4.859">launch nuclear attacks on the state&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.289" dur="4.63">you know and South Korea of course</text>
  <text start="279.789" dur="6.03">that&amp;#39;s you know and they&amp;#39;re also saying</text>
  <text start="281.919" dur="5.821">that they&amp;#39;re going to use their cyber</text>
  <text start="285.819" dur="7.051">weapons the north of Korea is going to</text>
  <text start="287.74" dur="8.01">use their cyber weapons that could bring</text>
  <text start="292.87" dur="7.019">down the infrastructure and they keep</text>
  <text start="295.75" dur="7.65">saying this they keep saying that the</text>
  <text start="299.889" dur="7.71">that they could hit the power grid the</text>
  <text start="303.4" dur="6.979">water the main us infrastructure is just</text>
  <text start="307.599" dur="5.88">amazing to me and here&amp;#39;s another report</text>
  <text start="310.379" dur="6.13">North Korea readies missile launches</text>
  <text start="313.479" dur="6.84">fears of covert cyberwar grows again</text>
  <text start="316.509" dur="8.72">they&amp;#39;re talking about the same thing you</text>
  <text start="320.319" dur="8.791">know about hitting the United States</text>
  <text start="325.229" dur="5.59">infrastructure and here&amp;#39;s a quote it</text>
  <text start="329.11" dur="4.98">would demonstrate that North Korea is a</text>
  <text start="330.819" dur="5.551">strong cyberpower Jang said their prime</text>
  <text start="334.09" dur="4.47">target is the US and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="336.37" dur="6.599">preparing for something like this for</text>
  <text start="338.56" dur="7.409">years and they keep going on and on and</text>
  <text start="342.969" dur="6.181">on saying that they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re ready and</text>
  <text start="345.969" dur="6.031">they&amp;#39;re going to do it and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="349.15" dur="5.28">be against banks the United States</text>
  <text start="352" dur="6.21">infrastructure and to me they</text>
  <text start="354.43" dur="6.51">continually are bombarding us with this</text>
  <text start="358.21" dur="8.579">news and information and that leads me</text>
  <text start="360.94" dur="8.43">to one conclusion is that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="366.789" dur="5.071">to do some type of cyber attack and</text>
  <text start="369.37" dur="5.37">either I mean I&amp;#39;m thinking a blackout of</text>
  <text start="371.86" dur="5.609">some sort which would shut down the</text>
  <text start="374.74" dur="5.7">banks which would bring us into war we</text>
  <text start="377.469" dur="4.41">can blame another country and this is</text>
  <text start="380.44" dur="4.409">the way it seems like they&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="381.879" dur="5.121">they&amp;#39;re moving and if we look at this</text>
  <text start="384.849" dur="6.301">and we look at what&amp;#39;s going on with you</text>
  <text start="387" dur="6.819">know in the war and I mean that in the</text>
  <text start="391.15" dur="7.139">word in the the propaganda with North</text>
  <text start="393.819" dur="5.82">Korea we can see that things are</text>
  <text start="398.289" dur="3.151">starting to escalate even though the</text>
  <text start="399.639" dur="3.481">United States is trying to downplay it</text>
  <text start="401.44" dur="5.82">now I think this is part of their</text>
  <text start="403.12" dur="6.96">strategy downplay it and let know</text>
  <text start="407.26" dur="5.28">Korea keep going with it and this way</text>
  <text start="410.08" dur="4.95">something can happen and we can set the</text>
  <text start="412.54" dur="4.47">United States can say oh look say we</text>
  <text start="415.03" dur="4.95">were debt we weren&amp;#39;t doing anything and</text>
  <text start="417.01" dur="5.64">all of a sudden they just decided to to</text>
  <text start="419.98" dur="7.53">sing something or do a cyber attack or</text>
  <text start="422.65" dur="7.26">you know anything like that now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="427.51" dur="4.41">an animal that that says North Korea is</text>
  <text start="429.91" dur="4.71">a direct threat to the United States of</text>
  <text start="431.92" dur="5.1">America and this is Admiral Samuel</text>
  <text start="434.62" dur="9.06">Locklear commander of the US Pacific</text>
  <text start="437.02" dur="11.82">Command and he goes on to say that North</text>
  <text start="443.68" dur="8.67">Korea is a complete threat to the United</text>
  <text start="448.84" dur="11.79">States especially with their nuclear</text>
  <text start="452.35" dur="9.72">weapons and this is a quote from him the</text>
  <text start="460.63" dur="3.78">continued advancement of the North&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.07" dur="3.99">nuclear and missile programs its</text>
  <text start="464.41" dur="3.09">conventional force posture and its</text>
  <text start="466.06" dur="4.05">willingness to resort to asymmetric</text>
  <text start="467.5" dur="4.86">actions as a tool of coercive diplomacy</text>
  <text start="470.11" dur="4.26">creates an environment marked by the</text>
  <text start="472.36" dur="4.53">potential for miscalculation that and</text>
  <text start="474.37" dur="5.03">controlled escalation could result from</text>
  <text start="476.89" dur="5.37">another North Korean provocation action</text>
  <text start="479.4" dur="5.38">Locklear told the panel so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="482.26" dur="6.45">building this case that North Korea is</text>
  <text start="484.78" dur="5.31">going to attack and there&amp;#39;s we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="488.71" dur="6.36">know what this attack is going to be but</text>
  <text start="490.09" dur="7.38">we need to be ready and again thank you</text>
  <text start="495.07" dur="5.43">to the messenger and I saw this report</text>
  <text start="497.47" dur="7.56">also there are two Romeo class</text>
  <text start="500.5" dur="7.98">submarines that lost communication from</text>
  <text start="505.03" dur="5.7">North Korea now it&amp;#39;s about 4,000 with</text>
  <text start="508.48" dur="5.67">from North Korea to Hawaii is about</text>
  <text start="510.73" dur="6.869">4,000 miles and approximately from North</text>
  <text start="514.15" dur="5.94">Korea to California it&amp;#39;s about 6,000</text>
  <text start="517.599" dur="6.63">miles and these two Romeo class</text>
  <text start="520.09" dur="7.38">submarines were are lost communication</text>
  <text start="524.229" dur="8.251">but someone on a ham radio picked up</text>
  <text start="527.47" dur="7.65">their communication and I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="532.48" dur="4.65">these submarines have been hijacked that</text>
  <text start="535.12" dur="6.51">these are going to be used in a false</text>
  <text start="537.13" dur="6.87">flag to surface outside of Hawaii or</text>
  <text start="541.63" dur="5.88">California because they definitely can</text>
  <text start="544" dur="6.75">reach that area or you know if they are</text>
  <text start="547.51" dur="5.82">hijacked would they fire something or do</text>
  <text start="550.75" dur="4.95">some type of missile launch would which</text>
  <text start="553.33" dur="6.33">would go into the desert and you know we</text>
  <text start="555.7" dur="7.14">can we can you know go to war over this</text>
  <text start="559.66" dur="7.86">I don&amp;#39;t know but this seems like a very</text>
  <text start="562.84" dur="6.03">probable scenario that I can see</text>
  <text start="567.52" dur="5.82">something happening because you have to</text>
  <text start="568.87" dur="7.62">remember to bring us into Wars look what</text>
  <text start="573.34" dur="8.67">happened in World War 2 the Japanese had</text>
  <text start="576.49" dur="10.95">a hit Pearl Harbor and that got everyone</text>
  <text start="582.01" dur="9.51">riled up and ready for war the World</text>
  <text start="587.44" dur="7.47">Trade Center in 911 had to come down for</text>
  <text start="591.52" dur="5.93">them to get us into Iraq that was their</text>
  <text start="594.91" dur="7.5">real mission that&amp;#39;s what they wanted but</text>
  <text start="597.45" dur="8.71">something big and something had to anger</text>
  <text start="602.41" dur="5.76">the American people now these two subs</text>
  <text start="606.16" dur="4.77">they would have to fire on something</text>
  <text start="608.17" dur="6.15">maybe they&amp;#39;ll fire on LA or is somewhere</text>
  <text start="610.93" dur="5.1">in Hawaii or another probable thing is a</text>
  <text start="614.32" dur="4.86">cyber attack like I&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="616.03" dur="5.4">about so these all these false flags and</text>
  <text start="619.18" dur="4.82">all these things are possibilities</text>
  <text start="621.43" dur="6.62">because it does have to be something</text>
  <text start="624" dur="6.4">something substantial that will first</text>
  <text start="628.05" dur="5.46">wake people up because most of the</text>
  <text start="630.4" dur="7.26">people are sleeping once they&amp;#39;re awake</text>
  <text start="633.51" dur="6.96">anger them enough for them to force the</text>
  <text start="637.66" dur="6.84">government to go to war and to retaliate</text>
  <text start="640.47" dur="7.54">against them I don&amp;#39;t know if just having</text>
  <text start="644.5" dur="4.92">submarines surface would do that you</text>
  <text start="648.01" dur="4.23">know because they can blame it on like</text>
  <text start="649.42" dur="6.24">oh we you know it was we were off course</text>
  <text start="652.24" dur="4.65">or we had damaged equipment there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="655.66" dur="3.86">many different things that they can use</text>
  <text start="656.89" dur="8.25">I think they they would need something</text>
  <text start="659.52" dur="9.37">to really hit the United States where it</text>
  <text start="665.14" dur="6.33">hurts and the only way to do this is</text>
  <text start="668.89" dur="5.1">with a firing of a missile or a</text>
  <text start="671.47" dur="3.96">cyberattack so we need to be prepared</text>
  <text start="673.99" dur="4.02">for this and everyone needs</text>
  <text start="675.43" dur="6.719">still to get prepared and not let your</text>
  <text start="678.01" dur="6.45">guard down and be ready because you hear</text>
