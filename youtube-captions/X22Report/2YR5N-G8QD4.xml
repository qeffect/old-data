  <text start="318.33" dur="7.769">new economy that is being created for</text>
  <text start="322.05" dur="6.69">the people now as we can see Trump has</text>
  <text start="326.099" dur="6.69">gotten rid of many of the globalist</text>
  <text start="328.74" dur="8.519">deals Trump is pushing his agenda to</text>

  <text start="347.129" dur="8.401">restructured along with that comes the</text>
  <text start="350.94" dur="7.65">IRS now Trump just signed the tax payer</text>
  <text start="355.53" dur="5.849">first bill Monday to protect people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.59" dur="5.91">assets from being seized by the IRS</text>
  <text start="361.379" dur="6.35">which the government agency does even</text>
  <text start="364.5" dur="5.969">without charging taxpayers with a crime</text>

  <text start="396.81" dur="6.569">going to chip away at the IRS a little</text>
  <text start="399.75" dur="6.96">bit at a time I just want to go back a</text>

  <text start="527.089" dur="8.461">tax was abolished now in 1906 with the</text>
  <text start="532.49" dur="5.58">election of Theodore Roosevelt and later</text>
  <text start="535.55" dur="5.4">his successor William Howard Taft the</text>
  <text start="538.07" dur="6.45">United States saw a popular movement for</text>
  <text start="540.95" dur="6.27">tax reform hmm was this really a</text>
  <text start="544.52" dur="5.43">movement for tax reform or was at the</text>
  <text start="547.22" dur="3.83">central bankers coming in and pushing</text>
  <text start="549.95" dur="5.25">their agenda</text>
  <text start="551.05" dur="8.35">remember they plan this way in advance</text>
  <text start="555.2" dur="5.57">and they create the illusion that the</text>
  <text start="559.4" dur="4.7">people want</text>
  <text start="560.77" dur="6.18">that we need this so the movement</text>
  <text start="564.1" dur="5.7">culminated during the then candidate</text>
  <text start="566.95" dur="5.79">Woodrow Wilson&amp;#39;s election of 1912 and in</text>
  <text start="569.8" dur="5.61">February of 1913 the ratification of</text>
  <text start="572.74" dur="5.55">what the sixteenth amendment to United</text>
  <text start="575.41" dur="5.01">States was then ratified were some</text>
  <text start="578.29" dur="6.09">people saying that it was never ratified</text>
  <text start="580.42" dur="6">and this said that that that the</text>
  <text start="584.38" dur="4.17">Congress shall have power to lay and</text>
  <text start="586.42" dur="4.289">collect taxes on incomes from whatever</text>
  <text start="588.55" dur="4.17">source derived without apportionment</text>
  <text start="590.709" dur="6.211">among the several states and without</text>
  <text start="592.72" dur="7.559">regard to any census or enumeration this</text>
  <text start="596.92" dur="6.8">granted Congress the specific power to</text>

  <text start="605.89" dur="5.79">population by February 19 1913</text>
  <text start="609.63" dur="3.91">thirty-six states had ratified the</text>
  <text start="611.68" dur="4.02">change to the Constitution it was</text>
  <text start="613.54" dur="5.79">further ratified by six more states by</text>
  <text start="615.7" dur="5.34">March of the 48 states at the time 42</text>
  <text start="619.33" dur="3.81">ratified it Connecticut Rhode Island in</text>
  <text start="621.04" dur="4.32">Utah rejected the amendment Pennsylvania</text>
  <text start="623.14" dur="5.28">Virginia Florida did not take up the</text>
  <text start="625.36" dur="5.94">issue so what we had happening here is</text>
  <text start="628.42" dur="5.789">we had this the Federal Reserve which</text>
  <text start="631.3" dur="6.33">came into power and then we had the</text>
  <text start="634.209" dur="6">sixteenth amendment which allowed taxes</text>
  <text start="637.63" dur="3.69">to be collected now in the first year</text>
  <text start="640.209" dur="3.57">after ratification of the sixteenth</text>
  <text start="641.32" dur="4.829">amendment no taxes were collected</text>
  <text start="643.779" dur="4.591">instead taxpayer simply completed the</text>
  <text start="646.149" dur="5.161">form and the IRS checked the form for</text>
  <text start="648.37" dur="5.279">accuracy the IRS has workload jumped by</text>
  <text start="651.31" dur="5.19">tenfold triggering a massive</text>
  <text start="653.649" dur="5.43">restructuring professional tax</text>
  <text start="656.5" dur="5.61">collectors began to replace a system of</text>
  <text start="659.079" dur="6.541">patronage appointments the IRS doubled</text>
  <text start="662.11" dur="6.93">its staff but was still processing 1917</text>
  <text start="665.62" dur="6.99">returns in 1919 they started to ramp</text>
  <text start="669.04" dur="6.48">this up all of this was created at the</text>
  <text start="672.61" dur="5.82">same time because the central bankers</text>
  <text start="675.52" dur="6.569">they needed to collect taxes from the</text>
  <text start="678.43" dur="6.12">people in order to pay the interest on</text>
  <text start="682.089" dur="6.331">the debt when the government borrowed</text>
  <text start="684.55" dur="6.51">the currency all of this was done at the</text>
  <text start="688.42" dur="4.7">same time so the IRS and the central</text>
  <text start="691.06" dur="6.12">bank they go hand in hand</text>
  <text start="693.12" dur="8.649">Trump will need to completely undo this</text>
  <text start="697.18" dur="7.529">and remember when this all started they</text>
  <text start="701.769" dur="5.701">said oh don&amp;#39;t worry only the wealthy</text>
  <text start="704.709" dur="5.521">will have to pay this tax everyone else</text>
  <text start="707.47" dur="5.549">won&amp;#39;t and this was like this for many</text>
  <text start="710.23" dur="4.71">many years but then they said ok now we</text>
  <text start="713.019" dur="4.081">need the upper class to pay some taxes</text>
  <text start="714.94" dur="4.139">then we need the middle class then we</text>
  <text start="717.1" dur="5.01">need the low middle class then we need</text>
  <text start="719.079" dur="6.601">the poor and before you knew it everyone</text>
  <text start="722.11" dur="5.789">was paying taxes and what happened after</text>
  <text start="725.68" dur="4.29">that they created more and more laws</text>
  <text start="727.899" dur="6.3">where you had to pay more and more taxes</text>
  <text start="729.97" dur="6.559">why because the debt load got larger and</text>
