  <text start="246.989" dur="6.301">difficult to live at this time and we</text>
  <text start="250.35" dur="5.22">have to remember that people could not</text>
  <text start="253.29" dur="5.31">take out money that they needed because</text>

  <text start="278.279" dur="3.75">have a few thousand euros in the bank so</text>
  <text start="280.169" dur="5.011">I really don&amp;#39;t care what happens it just</text>
  <text start="282.029" dur="6.211">it&amp;#39;s just the insecurity you feel I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="285.18" dur="5.4">planning to come and get 300 out 300</text>
  <text start="288.24" dur="4.289">euros every single day until my bank</text>
  <text start="290.58" dur="5.13">account is empty and you see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="292.529" dur="4.801">happening people want their money it</text>
  <text start="295.71" dur="4.049">would be the first thing that I would do</text>
  <text start="297.33" dur="4.41">is get down to the bank to try to get my</text>
  <text start="299.759" dur="3.421">money out but I don&amp;#39;t keep much in the</text>
  <text start="301.74" dur="3.81">bank I only keep enough to pay for the</text>
  <text start="303.18" dur="3.989">bills and this way I will never be</text>
  <text start="305.55" dur="4.199">caught in this type of situation and</text>
  <text start="307.169" dur="5.941">there should be a lesson to everybody</text>
  <text start="309.749" dur="4.711">who is out there not to keep that much</text>
  <text start="313.11" dur="4.619">in the bank as in my personal opinion</text>
  <text start="314.46" dur="7.379">only keep enough in there to pay your</text>
  <text start="317.729" dur="8.071">bills and things like that now in Spain</text>
  <text start="321.839" dur="7.771">they just discovered a 20 billion euro</text>
  <text start="325.8" dur="7.19">was hidden in non-performing loans their</text>
  <text start="329.61" dur="5.85">banks are having a huge huge problem</text>
  <text start="332.99" dur="5.829">non-performing loans of spanish banks to</text>
  <text start="335.46" dur="6.479">end to the end of September told totaled</text>
  <text start="338.819" dur="6.541">around 92 billion euros twenty-nine</text>
  <text start="341.939" dur="7.111">percent more than the 71 billion that</text>
  <text start="345.36" dur="5.789">they thought and it was up by another 20</text>
  <text start="349.05" dur="4.979">billion which they found which I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="351.149" dur="6.27">know where it was but late payments in</text>
  <text start="354.029" dur="5.94">June rose to 11.9 percent from ten</text>
  <text start="357.419" dur="5.761">percent the previous year and this</text>
  <text start="359.969" dur="5.73">August has rose to twelve percent and</text>
  <text start="363.18" dur="4.469">these these are late payments people</text>
  <text start="365.699" dur="3.99">going to end up defaulting because what</text>
  <text start="367.649" dur="7.8">do we know in Spain the unemployment</text>
  <text start="369.689" dur="9.301">rate is very very high and right now the</text>
  <text start="375.449" dur="6.481">Bank of Spain is warning destabilizing</text>
  <text start="378.99" dur="5.699">effects and there could be balanced</text>
  <text start="381.93" dur="5.549">coming down the road because the bank</text>
  <text start="384.689" dur="5.22">just cannot keep its head above water</text>
  <text start="387.479" dur="5.731">right now and this is the main problem</text>
  <text start="389.909" dur="4.98">that is going on in Europe and on the</text>
  <text start="393.21" dur="4.65">people today we were talking about</text>
  <text start="394.889" dur="5.76">different things and I have to agree the</text>
  <text start="397.86" dur="4.919">US and the Europe are not even in a</text>
  <text start="400.649" dur="5.101">recession anymore I would call this a</text>
  <text start="402.779" dur="5.101">depression at this time because we are</text>
  <text start="405.75" dur="4.16">seeing layoffs which</text>
  <text start="407.88" dur="5.13">seeing unemployment in the double digits</text>
  <text start="409.91" dur="5.41">yes everything is manipulated the</text>
  <text start="413.01" dur="4.65">illusion is kept everyone from seeing</text>
  <text start="415.32" dur="5.1">bread lines and things like that but we</text>
  <text start="417.66" dur="5.64">all know we are having major major</text>
  <text start="420.42" dur="6.38">problems and in France right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="423.3" dur="9.06">looking to cut around 1,300 jobs in</text>
  <text start="426.8" dur="8.35">alstom and they are cutting these jobs</text>
  <text start="432.36" dur="4.28">and letting people go but we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="435.15" dur="5.43">this all over the place we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="436.64" dur="7.78">many corporations starting to lay off a</text>
  <text start="440.58" dur="6.18">lot of people why because they realize</text>
  <text start="444.42" dur="3.78">that they have losses coming up they</text>
  <text start="446.76" dur="2.91">need to get rid of the people they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="448.2" dur="3.18">pay their pensions they can&amp;#39;t pay their</text>
  <text start="449.67" dur="3.96">medical costs they can&amp;#39;t pay their</text>
  <text start="451.38" dur="4.38">salaries and if they cut these people it</text>
  <text start="453.63" dur="4.11">makes the company look more profitable</text>
  <text start="455.76" dur="4.7">but this only works for a short period</text>
  <text start="457.74" dur="5.58">of time because as more and more people</text>
  <text start="460.46" dur="4.33">are unemployed it makes it more</text>
  <text start="463.32" dur="4.02">difficult for the companies to make a</text>
  <text start="464.79" dur="5.37">profit and this is what&amp;#39;s been happening</text>
  <text start="467.34" dur="5.85">and we see thousands of people being</text>
  <text start="470.16" dur="7.2">laid off at this time even Germany right</text>
  <text start="473.19" dur="7.38">now is having a rough time official data</text>
  <text start="477.36" dur="6.42">shows that Germany their industrial</text>
  <text start="480.57" dur="6.57">output declined in September and they</text>
  <text start="483.78" dur="6.6">are now feeling the pinch of the</text>
  <text start="487.14" dur="6.72">eurozone debt crisis construction and</text>
  <text start="490.38" dur="7.59">manufacturing output slump by 1.8 and</text>
  <text start="493.86" dur="7.02">2.1 percent and Germans unemployment</text>
  <text start="497.97" dur="6.39">rate increase unexpectedly in October to</text>
  <text start="500.88" dur="6.21">the highest level since 2011 and right</text>
  <text start="504.36" dur="4.83">now 16.1 percent of the German</text>
  <text start="507.09" dur="5.46">population are approximately or</text>
  <text start="509.19" dur="6.599">approximately 13 million people run the</text>
  <text start="512.55" dur="6.419">risk of plunging into relative poverty</text>
  <text start="515.789" dur="6">so right now Germany is feeling the</text>
  <text start="518.969" dur="6.991">effects of what is happening in the</text>
  <text start="521.789" dur="8.311">eurozone now if we come back to the</text>
  <text start="525.96" dur="7.49">United States consumer are being very</text>
  <text start="530.1" dur="6.65">very cautious and the US economic growth</text>
  <text start="533.45" dur="6.49">kind of slowed in the third quarter and</text>
  <text start="536.75" dur="4.84">consumers are keeping a lid on their</text>
  <text start="539.94" dur="3.96">spending well of course</text>
  <text start="541.59" dur="4.35">they are because if we really look at</text>
  <text start="543.9" dur="3.66">their unemployment and the real numbers</text>
  <text start="545.94" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;re looking at twenty four percent</text>
  <text start="547.56" dur="7.14">unemployment what does that tell you</text>
  <text start="551.43" dur="5.79">well people don&amp;#39;t have jobs people do</text>
  <text start="554.7" dur="5.4">not have disposable income and this is</text>
  <text start="557.22" dur="8.61">why you see retail stores showing a</text>
  <text start="560.1" dur="7.77">decline in sales and right now a US</text>
  <text start="565.83" dur="4.59">economist is saying that there are no</text>
  <text start="567.87" dur="5.76">signs that the economy is picking up at</text>
  <text start="570.42" dur="6.36">this time and what you saw in the third</text>
  <text start="573.63" dur="6.33">quarter right now will be increased in</text>
  <text start="576.78" dur="5.64">the fourth quarter you&amp;#39;ll see a lot more</text>
  <text start="579.96" dur="4.68">people unemployed you&amp;#39;ll see a lot more</text>
  <text start="582.42" dur="4.98">people not spending money you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="584.64" dur="4.14">retail sales declining you&amp;#39;ll see of</text>

  <text start="590.34" dur="5.04">applications will be plunging further</text>
  <text start="592.02" dur="6.78">pending how sales down the toilet this</text>
  <text start="595.38" dur="6.3">whole thing is coming apart at it seems</text>
  <text start="598.8" dur="5.4">at the seams and we can see this all</text>
  <text start="601.68" dur="4.38">over the place and I know the Fed the US</text>
  <text start="604.2" dur="4.65">government putting out statistics that</text>
  <text start="606.06" dur="5.76">there&amp;#39;s no inflation but every time I go</text>

  <text start="624.66" dur="3.33">the prices of the same but giving you</text>
  <text start="626.31" dur="5.01">less for your money and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="627.99" dur="6.38">this all over the place but what has</text>
  <text start="631.32" dur="6.21">happened is the global food prices are</text>
  <text start="634.37" dur="7.6">showing that they&amp;#39;ve risen in October</text>
  <text start="637.53" dur="7.98">and of course they are because things</text>
  <text start="641.97" dur="5.61">are definitely going up and I it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="645.51" dur="3.63">amazing how people don&amp;#39;t even see this I</text>

  <text start="702.42" dur="6.12">chemical foods but that&amp;#39;s just a side</text>
  <text start="704.76" dur="7.59">note here what else are we seeing at</text>
  <text start="708.54" dur="8.34">this time we are seeing that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="712.35" dur="8.07">job loss signals and economic Armageddon</text>
  <text start="716.88" dur="6.6">and there has been a report released by</text>
  <text start="720.42" dur="5.7">challenger gray &amp;amp; christmas and they</text>
  <text start="723.48" dur="5.36">highlight a growing decline in</text>
  <text start="726.12" dur="5.7">employment and signals that something</text>
  <text start="728.84" dur="5.26">really terrible is about to happen here</text>
  <text start="731.82" dur="5.64">and what we are seeing we are seeing</text>
  <text start="734.1" dur="5.73">many companies I&amp;#39;ve reviewed many of the</text>
  <text start="737.46" dur="5.24">layoffs but let me go through some of</text>
  <text start="739.83" dur="5.58">the other companies that have laid off</text>
  <text start="742.7" dur="8.05">JPMorgan Chase there are total job cuts</text>
  <text start="745.41" dur="12.08">right now are 19,000 jcpenney total job</text>
  <text start="750.75" dur="11.73">cuts 15,000 IBM total job cuts right now</text>

  <text start="768" dur="6.48">block buster 3,000 United Technologies</text>
  <text start="772.13" dur="5.02">3000 so we can see what is happening</text>
  <text start="774.48" dur="5.58">right now and what this goes on to say</text>
  <text start="777.15" dur="5.22">is that it&amp;#39;s important to bear in mind</text>
  <text start="780.06" dur="4.83">is that according to the Challenger Gray</text>
  <text start="782.37" dur="5.03">and Christmas reports the reasons cited</text>
  <text start="784.89" dur="5.82">for these job cuts is restructuring</text>
  <text start="787.4" dur="5.05">cost-cutting and closing clearly and</text>
  <text start="790.71" dur="4.8">indicating that these job cuts are</text>
  <text start="792.45" dur="6.6">permanent for all intents and purposes</text>
  <text start="795.51" dur="5.94">so all these businesses are and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="799.05" dur="4.47">not even counting the small the smaller</text>
  <text start="801.45" dur="4.14">businesses that make up like fifty four</text>
  <text start="803.52" dur="4.05">percent of people employed in this</text>
  <text start="805.59" dur="4.23">company because most of those companies</text>
  <text start="807.57" dur="4.81">don&amp;#39;t even report it</text>
  <text start="809.82" dur="5.83">these jobs are not being replaced</text>
  <text start="812.38" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re gone they&amp;#39;re done so most of the</text>
  <text start="815.65" dur="4.02">people who are getting jobs right now</text>
  <text start="817.09" dur="5.13">are getting part-time temporary jobs and</text>
  <text start="819.67" dur="5.81">if you notice from my past reports the</text>
  <text start="822.22" dur="6.51">service sector jobs have been going</text>
  <text start="825.48" dur="5.74">sky-high and these are you know</text>
  <text start="828.73" dur="4.29">restaurant hospitality and let me just</text>
  <text start="831.22" dur="4.05">say you do not make the same amount of</text>
  <text start="833.02" dur="4.58">money as you do with a full-time</text>
  <text start="835.27" dur="4.2">position in one of these companies and</text>
  <text start="837.6" dur="4.33">especially if you&amp;#39;re a waiter or</text>
  <text start="839.47" dur="4.95">waitress and things like that not</text>
  <text start="841.93" dur="4.29">putting down any of these jobs but for</text>
  <text start="844.42" dur="4.95">people coming from a full-time job</text>
  <text start="846.22" dur="5.85">moving into these type of jobs it makes</text>
  <text start="849.37" dur="5.61">it much harder to live and this is why</text>
  <text start="852.07" dur="5.459">we see a decline in sales we see a</text>
  <text start="854.98" dur="5.88">decline in people spending money in</text>
  <text start="857.529" dur="6.541">different places like cars like houses</text>
  <text start="860.86" dur="5.55">like clothing like electronics and this</text>
  <text start="864.07" dur="8.459">is why stores are closing and stores are</text>
  <text start="866.41" dur="8.64">laying off people okay now to help the</text>
  <text start="872.529" dur="4.471">economy the Fed and the government</text>
  <text start="875.05" dur="5.88">decided hey you know what we can do</text>
  <text start="877" dur="5.76">let&amp;#39;s start giving loans to anyone that</text>
  <text start="880.93" dur="3.54">wants to get an education who cares</text>
  <text start="882.76" dur="4.59">doesn&amp;#39;t matter what the credit is let&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="887.35" dur="4.77">car and we&amp;#39;ll give it to all the</text>
  <text start="888.52" dur="6.75">subprime borrowers they bad credit no</text>
  <text start="892.12" dur="4.35">credit they&amp;#39;re in bankruptcy doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="895.27" dur="4.92">make a difference let&amp;#39;s just give them</text>
  <text start="896.47" dur="7.47">the loans so we can show sales and right</text>
  <text start="900.19" dur="7.5">now student and car loans represent 99</text>
  <text start="903.94" dur="9.21">percent of all loans taken out in the</text>
  <text start="907.69" dur="7.59">past year and this goes on to say that</text>
  <text start="913.15" dur="5.4">the US government is handing out unruhe</text>
  <text start="915.28" dur="6.54">payable student and car loans looking at</text>
  <text start="918.55" dur="5.87">the numbers 13.7 billion in total</text>
  <text start="921.82" dur="7.23">consumer credit created in September</text>
  <text start="924.42" dur="7.66">15.8 billion was non revolving credit</text>
  <text start="929.05" dur="8.55">which was otto and student loans and no</text>
  <text start="932.08" dur="8.39">this is not a typo so we&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="937.6" dur="5.81">yesterday about the student loans</text>
  <text start="940.47" dur="6.18">and we understand that the US government</text>
  <text start="943.41" dur="5.85">and the student loan providers are</text>
  <text start="946.65" dur="4.92">sending letters out to students because</text>
  <text start="949.26" dur="3.78">just like people who are in their homes</text>
  <text start="951.57" dur="3.69">and they were underwater with their</text>
  <text start="953.04" dur="4.02">mortgages well students are underwater</text>
  <text start="955.26" dur="5.16">with their student loans because they</text>
  <text start="957.06" dur="6.48">cannot find work in their field or</text>
  <text start="960.42" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re taking part time jobs where</text>
  <text start="963.54" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re not making the same amount of</text>
  <text start="964.98" dur="4.98">money and when you go to school and you</text>
  <text start="967.11" dur="4.86">have a huge student loan it makes it</text>
  <text start="969.96" dur="3.87">very difficult to pay back so a letter</text>
  <text start="971.97" dur="4.08">went out saying listen we can modify</text>
  <text start="973.83" dur="4.41">your student loan to make the payments a</text>
  <text start="976.05" dur="3.57">lot less or in some cases you don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="978.24" dur="5.13">have to make a payment for a certain</text>
  <text start="979.62" dur="5.1">period of time well we understand these</text>
  <text start="983.37" dur="3.87">student loans are never going to be big</text>
  <text start="984.72" dur="5.55">never going to be paid back and we get</text>
  <text start="987.24" dur="5.58">this the student loan bubble is reaching</text>
  <text start="990.27" dur="6.09">its height it is blown up it is huge it</text>
  <text start="992.82" dur="5.82">is ready to pop so of course what is JP</text>
  <text start="996.36" dur="5.04">Morgan Chase do they have sent a</text>
  <text start="998.64" dur="4.77">memorandum to colleges notifying that</text>
  <text start="1001.4" dur="5.07">the bank will stop making new student</text>
  <text start="1003.41" dur="5.73">loans in October and what is their</text>
  <text start="1006.47" dur="9.38">reason we just don&amp;#39;t see this as a</text>
  <text start="1009.14" dur="12">market that we can significance before</text>
  <text start="1015.85" dur="10.39">during 2007 during the subprime security</text>
  <text start="1021.14" dur="7.5">mortgage scam HSBC back in that time</text>
  <text start="1026.24" dur="4.5">said we are no longer doing this and</text>
  <text start="1028.64" dur="4.68">what they&amp;#39;ve said it&amp;#39;s no longer</text>
  <text start="1030.74" dur="5.52">sustainable and not the right place to</text>
  <text start="1033.32" dur="4.74">allocate capital in the future so they</text>
  <text start="1036.26" dur="4.86">are you know they&amp;#39;re out of the subprime</text>
  <text start="1038.06" dur="9.39">security end of it and we are seeing the</text>
  <text start="1041.12" dur="9.09">same signs happening right now but</text>
  <text start="1047.45" dur="5.94">remember the US government the Fed they</text>
  <text start="1050.21" dur="4.35">will never admit to anything actually if</text>
  <text start="1053.39" dur="5.79">you went back into the Great Depression</text>
  <text start="1054.56" dur="7.59">in 1929 they didn&amp;#39;t even admit there was</text>
  <text start="1059.18" dur="6.36">a depression at the time they only</text>
  <text start="1062.15" dur="8.79">really admitted it after it was all said</text>
  <text start="1065.54" dur="7.49">and done now here are temps here are the</text>
  <text start="1070.94" dur="3.98">10 steps closer to and</text>
  <text start="1073.03" dur="3.99">economic Armageddon now let&amp;#39;s see what</text>
  <text start="1074.92" dur="5.46">what here we are let&amp;#39;s see where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1077.02" dur="6.66">going here number one Europe is not in</text>
  <text start="1080.38" dur="8.46">good shape anyone who believe they were</text>
  <text start="1083.68" dur="8.19">should be disabused of such notions</text>
  <text start="1088.84" dur="5.64">number two the forcing down of interest</text>
  <text start="1091.87" dur="6.56">rates once again further exasperates the</text>
  <text start="1094.48" dur="3.95">longer term misallocation of resources</text>
  <text start="1098.91" dur="4.3">macroeconomics is failed witchcraft</text>
  <text start="1101.62" dur="5.13">which should be apparent to anyone</text>
  <text start="1103.21" dur="6.48">paying attention governments around the</text>
  <text start="1106.75" dur="6.75">world have only this hammer liquidity</text>
  <text start="1109.69" dur="6.45">and stimulus liquidity and stimulus this</text>
  <text start="1113.5" dur="5.7">number five will not end in the US or</text>
  <text start="1116.14" dur="4.41">Europe until the markets end it number</text>
  <text start="1119.2" dur="4.71">six and we understand this the</text>
  <text start="1120.55" dur="6.78">government will never ever taper</text>
  <text start="1123.91" dur="5.97">actually they will create an event to</text>
  <text start="1127.33" dur="4.62">increase the amount of QE that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1129.88" dur="4.89">doing right now and the reason for that</text>
  <text start="1131.95" dur="5.67">is because they understand the economy</text>
  <text start="1134.77" dur="6.27">is collapsing and when there are signs</text>
  <text start="1137.62" dur="7.32">that other nations see of this collapse</text>
  <text start="1141.04" dur="5.88">coming they&amp;#39;re going to throw and throw</text>
  <text start="1144.94" dur="5.07">back their Treasury bonds and the Fed</text>
  <text start="1146.92" dur="5.34">will have to purchase them other nations</text>
  <text start="1150.01" dur="4.17">will get rid of their cash the US dollar</text>
  <text start="1152.26" dur="4.38">because they don&amp;#39;t want to hold on to it</text>
  <text start="1154.18" dur="5.76">the real estate market will come</text>
  <text start="1156.64" dur="5.37">crumbling down and the Fed will have to</text>
  <text start="1159.94" dur="4.47">buy even more toxic real estate the</text>
  <text start="1162.01" dur="5.19">banks are holding so this is why they</text>
  <text start="1164.41" dur="7.35">will never ever taper this is why we</text>
  <text start="1167.2" dur="7.2">will see any an increase of QE number</text>
  <text start="1171.76" dur="4.5">six governments are in full pretend mode</text>
  <text start="1174.4" dur="4.44">they have no control over the situation</text>
  <text start="1176.26" dur="5.16">other than to fool people into believing</text>
  <text start="1178.84" dur="4.56">that things are getting better number</text>
  <text start="1181.42" dur="3.81">seven the policy is employed by</text>
  <text start="1183.4" dur="4.2">governments ensure the destruction of</text>
  <text start="1185.23" dur="4.23">economies and themselves number eight</text>
  <text start="1187.6" dur="4.26">currencies are being destroyed in terms</text>
  <text start="1189.46" dur="4.26">of purchasing power and we see this all</text>
  <text start="1191.86" dur="4.41">over the place with energy and food</text>
  <text start="1193.72" dur="4.68">things are getting much more expensive</text>

  <text start="1198.4" dur="6.39">correct economic problems no all they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1201.4" dur="5.4">doing is printing or creating more money</text>
  <text start="1204.79" dur="3.84">and putting that into</text>
  <text start="1206.8" dur="3.87">the bank&amp;#39;s hands which are then putting</text>
  <text start="1208.63" dur="3.81">it into the market and what is the</text>
  <text start="1210.67" dur="4.19">government doing they&amp;#39;re doing what they</text>
  <text start="1212.44" dur="5.22">do best they are just spending money</text>
  <text start="1214.86" dur="7.06">increasing that debt as fast as they</text>
  <text start="1217.66" dur="7.26">possibly can number ten the shelf life</text>
  <text start="1221.92" dur="5.49">of this government fraud is limited and</text>
  <text start="1224.92" dur="4.98">it is limited because we all understand</text>

  <text start="1260.38" dur="5.52">the system and it&amp;#39;s funny if you look</text>
  <text start="1262.9" dur="5.94">back in 1929 this is pretty much how it</text>
  <text start="1265.9" dur="6.69">played out Europe was in a recession /</text>

  <text start="1707.86" dur="8.76">keep the dollar prompt up they are right</text>
  <text start="1712.27" dur="8.28">now doing everything they can to keep</text>
  <text start="1716.62" dur="8.1">everything moving and everything going</text>
  <text start="1720.55" dur="7.11">the way they want it to go once they</text>
  <text start="1724.72" dur="5.7">lose total control all of this is going</text>
  <text start="1727.66" dur="5.61">to fall apart and they understand this</text>
  <text start="1730.42" dur="4.83">and this is why they are going to take</text>
  <text start="1733.27" dur="4.8">the next step because they understand</text>
  <text start="1735.25" dur="5.6">they can&amp;#39;t get into Iran they can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="1738.07" dur="7.64">into Syria the only way to do this now</text>
  <text start="1740.85" dur="8.04">is by using force and the only way to</text>
  <text start="1745.71" dur="7.1">use force is to have some type of false</text>
  <text start="1748.89" dur="8.16">flag event here in the United States and</text>
  <text start="1752.81" dur="8.32">this will come about this will happen it</text>
  <text start="1757.05" dur="5.85">will be a multi-prong type of false flag</text>
  <text start="1761.13" dur="4.14">event it will be coupled with cyber</text>
  <text start="1762.9" dur="5.01">attacks chemical weapons and we have to</text>
  <text start="1765.27" dur="6.93">remember in my last report cNN has</text>
  <text start="1767.91" dur="7.68">uncovered Intel that Assad has been has</text>
  <text start="1772.2" dur="5.46">a secret cache of chemical weapons and</text>
  <text start="1775.59" dur="7.44">we can see how this could be used as a</text>
  <text start="1777.66" dur="6.96">false flag and what else do we see</text>
  <text start="1783.03" dur="4.86">happening here well we understand that</text>
  <text start="1784.62" dur="6.81">Israel has been flying their military</text>
  <text start="1787.89" dur="6.39">planes into Syria bombing military bases</text>
  <text start="1791.43" dur="5.07">where they believe advanced missiles are</text>
  <text start="1794.28" dur="6.3">being kept and what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="1796.5" dur="6.42">is provoke Syria and right now a Syrian</text>
  <text start="1800.58" dur="4.53">diplomatic source said yesterday that</text>
  <text start="1802.92" dur="5.04">Syria had not reacted to an Israeli</text>
  <text start="1805.11" dur="5.87">attack within its territory but but that</text>
  <text start="1807.96" dur="5.93">it reserved the right to respond if</text>
  <text start="1810.98" dur="5.95">Israel continues with its provocations</text>
  <text start="1813.89" dur="5.62">there is the possibility that Syria will</text>
  <text start="1816.93" dur="6.48">respond with force and this is from</text>
  <text start="1819.51" dur="6.51">coming from an anonymous Syria source</text>
  <text start="1823.41" dur="5.22">which tells me that this is propaganda</text>
  <text start="1826.02" dur="6">and the reason why Israel is doing this</text>
  <text start="1828.63" dur="6.54">is to get Syria to do something this way</text>
  <text start="1832.02" dur="5.37">they can say the war is on Israel has a</text>
  <text start="1835.17" dur="6.69">treaty with the US the US will back up</text>
  <text start="1837.39" dur="8.1">Israel Syria has a treaty with Iran Iran</text>
  <text start="1841.86" dur="5.58">will back up Syria this allows Israel</text>
  <text start="1845.49" dur="6">and the u.s. to go through Syria to get</text>
  <text start="1847.44" dur="8.25">to Iran Russia is backing up Syria and</text>
  <text start="1851.49" dur="6.45">Iran and here we go with World War three</text>
  <text start="1855.69" dur="4.89">and this is what they&amp;#39;re looking to do</text>
  <text start="1857.94" dur="6.51">because these central bankers when</text>
  <text start="1860.58" dur="7.17">pushed back into a corner they will come</text>
  <text start="1864.45" dur="8.49">out kicking and screaming and they will</text>
  <text start="1867.75" dur="6.87">start a war to shift the blame of this</text>
  <text start="1872.94" dur="4.59">global</text>
  <text start="1874.62" dur="5.34">the collapse onto another country</text>
  <text start="1877.53" dur="5.22">because you have to remember they have</text>
  <text start="1879.96" dur="6.21">been building the illusion the case that</text>
  <text start="1882.75" dur="5.49">the economy is improving this is what</text>
  <text start="1886.17" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re telling everyone this is what</text>
  <text start="1888.24" dur="6.81">they want everyone to believe the stock</text>
  <text start="1891.12" dur="7.92">market is going up the unemployment is</text>
  <text start="1895.05" dur="6.84">going down gdp is in the positive range</text>
  <text start="1899.04" dur="5.37">and they are doing this to make their</text>
  <text start="1901.89" dur="5.97">case and they really thought they had</text>
  <text start="1904.41" dur="6">the event in Syria all wrapped up with a</text>
  <text start="1907.86" dur="4.41">nice little package and a bow and they</text>
  <text start="1910.41" dur="4.14">thought that this was going to take and</text>
  <text start="1912.27" dur="6.18">shift the blame off into Syria because</text>
  <text start="1914.55" dur="7.29">they were going to use an event to bring</text>
  <text start="1918.45" dur="7.109">down the entire economy and when this</text>
  <text start="1921.84" dur="5.61">didn&amp;#39;t happen this is why the Fed came</text>
  <text start="1925.559" dur="4.5">out and said there&amp;#39;s no taper at this</text>
  <text start="1927.45" dur="4.92">time because if they started the taper</text>
  <text start="1930.059" dur="4.681">what would have happened the economy</text>
  <text start="1932.37" dur="3.93">would have collapsed and guess what the</text>
  <text start="1934.74" dur="3.93">American people would have looked at the</text>
  <text start="1936.3" dur="7.05">Fed and said you did this to us and this</text>
  <text start="1938.67" dur="8.46">is why they&amp;#39;re not going to taper okay</text>
  <text start="1943.35" dur="9.74">now those people are listening to me in</text>
  <text start="1947.13" dur="9.69">London in England they are having a</text>

  <text start="2041.68" dur="6.94">prior to the drill coming up you know</text>
  <text start="2045.44" dur="6.47">that this thing will be going live if</text>
  <text start="2048.62" dur="6.3">you do not hear anything then we know</text>
  <text start="2051.91" dur="5.65">probably that nothing is going to happen</text>
  <text start="2054.92" dur="6">and they are using this drill to prepare</text>
  <text start="2057.56" dur="5.58">for something a little bit later because</text>
  <text start="2060.92" dur="4.68">we&amp;#39;ve seen this in the past we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="2063.14" dur="7.5">this with the LA Airport they had a</text>

  <text start="2079.429" dur="7.111">a test a test of how they could take</text>
  <text start="2082.07" dur="8.21">down the power grid structure so we</text>
  <text start="2086.54" dur="9.56">definitely have to look out for this now</text>
  <text start="2090.28" dur="8.35">it seems like the leaks from Snowden are</text>

  <text start="2213.62" dur="6.18">entire thing and we can see how this is</text>
  <text start="2216.8" dur="5.91">going to play out he is positioning the</text>
  <text start="2219.8" dur="5.64">military assets around the world at this</text>
  <text start="2222.71" dur="4.14">time because he understands and this is</text>
  <text start="2225.44" dur="4.68">the next part that I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="2226.85" dur="6.72">he understands that world war three is</text>
  <text start="2230.12" dur="5.88">inevitable it will happen he understands</text>
  <text start="2233.57" dur="5.22">the central bankers he understands how</text>
  <text start="2236" dur="5.73">they think he understands what is going</text>
  <text start="2238.79" dur="7.5">to happen and there&amp;#39;s just no way out of</text>
  <text start="2241.73" dur="7.68">it he understands that NATO is expanding</text>
  <text start="2246.29" dur="5.1">East I&amp;#39;ve reported that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2249.41" dur="6.3">setting up these missile shield in</text>
  <text start="2251.39" dur="8.25">Romania and in Poland and they are</text>
  <text start="2255.71" dur="9.05">putting all this in place and what the</text>
  <text start="2259.64" dur="7.32">report that has come in is that that the</text>
  <text start="2264.76" dur="4.48">interceptor missiles and these missile</text>
  <text start="2266.96" dur="5.16">shield M elements of the US and its NATO</text>
  <text start="2269.24" dur="4.44">allies the ones that have been placed to</text>
  <text start="2272.12" dur="2.88">surround Russia at this time because</text>
  <text start="2273.68" dur="2.07">that&amp;#39;s really where they&amp;#39;re pointing at</text>
  <text start="2275" dur="3.09">this time</text>
  <text start="2275.75" dur="6.09">can be turned into first-strike</text>
  <text start="2278.09" dur="6.81">offensive weapons with almost a flick of</text>
  <text start="2281.84" dur="6.75">a switch so they no longer are a shield</text>
  <text start="2284.9" dur="7.8">they are now weapons of mass destruction</text>
  <text start="2288.59" dur="7.11">and they&amp;#39;re also saying that these</text>
  <text start="2292.7" dur="5.49">missiles can also deliver nuclear</text>
  <text start="2295.7" dur="5.04">payloads directly into the heart of</text>
  <text start="2298.19" dur="5.43">Russia and this is why they are building</text>
  <text start="2300.74" dur="5.1">these bases here at this point and of</text>
  <text start="2303.62" dur="6.15">course they&amp;#39;re using it as a disguise as</text>
  <text start="2305.84" dur="7.08">a cloak to say that they&amp;#39;re building</text>
  <text start="2309.77" dur="4.62">these just in case Iran attacks which I</text>
  <text start="2312.92" dur="3">do not believe i believe they are</text>
  <text start="2314.39" dur="3.12">pointing them towards Russia because</text>
  <text start="2315.92" dur="3.65">they understand that Russia and China</text>
  <text start="2317.51" dur="6.09">are gum are going to come to the aid of</text>
  <text start="2319.57" dur="6.55">Syria and Iran and they understand that</text>
  <text start="2323.6" dur="5.4">there will be war and this is why the US</text>
  <text start="2326.12" dur="5.88">has been in circling China they deployed</text>
  <text start="2329" dur="5.31">a stealth destroyer and other ships in</text>
  <text start="2332" dur="3.99">the region Japan is changing their</text>
  <text start="2334.31" dur="4.26">constitution they built the first</text>
  <text start="2335.99" dur="3.87">warships since world war two they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2338.57" dur="4.23">been having all these drills and</text>
  <text start="2339.86" dur="9.33">capturing islands and you can see what</text>
  <text start="2342.8" dur="10.02">is happening at this time now other</text>
  <text start="2349.19" dur="5.4">witnesses and scientists knowledgeable</text>
  <text start="2352.82" dur="5.96">about the radar systems about the</text>
  <text start="2354.59" dur="7.5">defense shields have seen a test run</text>
  <text start="2358.78" dur="6.64">with the shield setup and what they are</text>
  <text start="2362.09" dur="6.09">reporting that the shields system that</text>
  <text start="2365.42" dur="5.91">the NATO forces are setting up in</text>
  <text start="2368.18" dur="6.42">Romania in Poland in the Mediterranean</text>
  <text start="2371.33" dur="5.01">are completely ineffective and they</text>
  <text start="2374.6" dur="3.96">allow forty percent of the missiles to</text>
  <text start="2376.34" dur="4.53">pass unstop and almost one hundred</text>
  <text start="2378.56" dur="6.17">percent ineffective against small</text>
  <text start="2380.87" dur="6.62">missiles and shorter range weapons and</text>
  <text start="2384.73" dur="5.29">we can see what is definitely happening</text>
  <text start="2387.49" dur="5.22">these Milt and I&amp;#39;ve said this for quite</text>
  <text start="2390.02" dur="4.8">a while now that all these countries are</text>
  <text start="2392.71" dur="5.86">setting up and positioning their</text>
  <text start="2394.82" dur="5.94">military assets in place for what will</text>
  <text start="2398.57" dur="4.71">eventually happen and you have to</text>
  <text start="2400.76" dur="8.089">understand these central bankers their</text>
  <text start="2403.28" dur="8.749">last act of desperation will be nuclear</text>
  <text start="2408.849" dur="6.93">they have underground bunkers they have</text>
  <text start="2412.029" dur="5.611">places to hide and eventually it will go</text>
  <text start="2415.779" dur="4.95">nuclear we understand that the US is</text>
  <text start="2417.64" dur="11.839">upgrading all its nuclear weapons at</text>
  <text start="2420.729" dur="11.28">this time and bombers at this time now</text>
  <text start="2429.479" dur="4.75">warnings have been issued to Russia from</text>
  <text start="2432.009" dur="3.691">many corners of the world since the</text>
  <text start="2434.229" dur="4.651">beginning of NATO&amp;#39;s eastward expansion</text>
  <text start="2435.7" dur="4.799">and why would Russia continue an attempt</text>
  <text start="2438.88" dur="4.109">to cooperate with a plan to surround</text>
  <text start="2440.499" dur="4.11">itself with NATO missiles Russia was</text>
  <text start="2442.989" dur="3.661">attempting to cooperate with the west</text>
  <text start="2444.609" dur="4.76">until the very end in a peaceful manner</text>
  <text start="2446.65" dur="6.53">we&amp;#39;ve seen that Russia came out and</text>
  <text start="2449.369" dur="6.91">stopped the attack on Syria because</text>
  <text start="2453.18" dur="6.939">Russian knew that if the United States</text>
  <text start="2456.279" dur="5.851">went in and struck and went into Syria</text>
  <text start="2460.119" dur="5.311">and a lot of the commanders here in the</text>
  <text start="2462.13" dur="6.09">United States also reported that they</text>
  <text start="2465.43" dur="6.119">would have to put troops on the ground</text>
  <text start="2468.22" dur="5.43">to maintain this and it would be it</text>
  <text start="2471.549" dur="3.871">would turn out to be an all-out war and</text>
  <text start="2473.65" dur="4.169">you know Russia and China would be</text>
  <text start="2475.42" dur="4.169">involved you know Iran would have gotten</text>
  <text start="2477.819" dur="4.861">involved and the whole thing would have</text>
  <text start="2479.589" dur="6.091">been blown out of proportion so right</text>
  <text start="2482.68" dur="6.51">now all countries are setting up their</text>
  <text start="2485.68" dur="7.079">military assets NATO is holding war</text>
  <text start="2489.19" dur="6.179">games very close to Russia Russia and</text>
  <text start="2492.759" dur="7.1">China are holding war games close to the</text>
  <text start="2495.369" dur="7.831">US and the NATO allies we&amp;#39;ve seen a</text>
  <text start="2499.859" dur="5.351">chinese warship in the Pacific near</text>
  <text start="2503.2" dur="5.49">Hawaii and we can see what is happening</text>
  <text start="2505.21" dur="5.19">at this time and Russia and China both</text>
  <text start="2508.69" dur="4.289">consider the United States to be their</text>
  <text start="2510.4" dur="4.619">number one GL geopolitical threat and</text>
  <text start="2512.979" dur="3.961">both nations have been systematically</text>
  <text start="2515.019" dur="3.631">strengthened and updating their</text>
  <text start="2516.94" dur="6.059">strategic forces and we do see this all</text>
  <text start="2518.65" dur="7.169">over the place and I mean we see China</text>
  <text start="2522.999" dur="5.451">is rapidly expanding its nuclear forces</text>
  <text start="2525.819" dur="5.49">with new missiles and submarines they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2528.45" dur="4.329">flexing their muscles and we have to</text>
  <text start="2531.309" dur="3.351">remember if I don&amp;#39;t know if everyone</text>
  <text start="2532.779" dur="4.171">remembers this a couple years ago</text>
  <text start="2534.66" dur="4.51">Chinese there was a Chinese submarine</text>
  <text start="2536.95" dur="4.139">that fired a test missile from just off</text>
  <text start="2539.17" dur="3.51">the west coast of the United States and</text>
  <text start="2541.089" dur="4.471">the US Navy</text>
  <text start="2542.68" dur="4.77">didn&amp;#39;t even know the sub was there if</text>
  <text start="2545.56" dur="4.92">that missile had been fired directly at</text>
  <text start="2547.45" dur="5.1">La it would have incinerated long before</text>
  <text start="2550.48" dur="7.23">the US government could ever have</text>
  <text start="2552.55" dur="6.78">responded to that at all and Russia and</text>
  <text start="2557.71" dur="4.2">China are thinking about these things</text>
  <text start="2559.33" dur="4.56">and they are rapidly preparing for the</text>
  <text start="2561.91" dur="4.95">day when war comes and they choose to</text>
  <text start="2563.89" dur="6.06">nuke us before we nuke them and this day</text>
  <text start="2566.86" dur="11.16">will come because I hate to say this the</text>
  <text start="2569.95" dur="12">central bankers believe that when the</text>
  <text start="2578.02" dur="6.87">war is over they are going to reset the</text>
  <text start="2581.95" dur="6.06">entire system and they will start</text>
