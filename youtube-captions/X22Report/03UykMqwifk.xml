  <text start="224.12" dur="5.759">economy we have been noticing that</text>
  <text start="226.819" dur="5.79">things well they&amp;#39;re deteriorating at an</text>
  <text start="229.879" dur="5.25">accelerated pace and when we look at</text>
  <text start="232.609" dur="4.951">retail it is a complete disaster there</text>
  <text start="235.129" dur="4.681">are many many people emailing me with</text>

  <text start="243.769" dur="3.511">in their neighborhoods we see a big</text>
  <text start="245.18" dur="4.199">change and we&amp;#39;re starting to see this</text>
  <text start="247.28" dur="4.319">spread across the country now if it</text>

  <text start="254.269" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s going to hit very very sudden</text>
  <text start="257.03" dur="4.379">because as more and more neighborhoods</text>
  <text start="259.669" dur="4.56">more and more cities more and more areas</text>
  <text start="261.409" dur="6.841">are hit by this it escalates and</text>
  <text start="264.229" dur="5.851">accelerates as time goes on and it hits</text>
  <text start="268.25" dur="4.53">very hard it&amp;#39;s almost like a tidal wave</text>
  <text start="270.08" dur="4.649">when it&amp;#39;s coming on to shore it just</text>
  <text start="272.78" dur="4.22">crashes in and everything just comes to</text>
  <text start="274.729" dur="5.43">a screeching halt and we are seeing that</text>
  <text start="277" dur="4.9">well it&amp;#39;s not looking good for retail</text>
  <text start="280.159" dur="3.69">whatsoever Dick&amp;#39;s Sporting Goods right</text>

  <text start="295.639" dur="4.291">that Dick&amp;#39;s was opening in the place of</text>
  <text start="297.74" dur="3.72">Sports Authority and I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="299.93" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s going to really happening right</text>
  <text start="301.46" dur="4.679">now we see that their earnings report</text>
  <text start="303.74" dur="5.01">came days after a shake-up in the</text>
  <text start="306.139" dur="5.28">company&amp;#39;s executive leadership and after</text>
  <text start="308.75" dur="5.909">the company&amp;#39;s admitted that they were</text>
  <text start="311.419" dur="6.75">maybe fudging the books well they called</text>
  <text start="314.659" dur="4.891">a computational blunder that resulted in</text>
  <text start="318.169" dur="3.331">a 23 point</text>
  <text start="319.55" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re a million overstatement in the</text>
  <text start="321.5" dur="6.69">fourth quarter profits that&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="324.38" dur="6.69">blunder and that is Wow a big mistake</text>
  <text start="328.19" dur="6.18">here so they&amp;#39;re not doing as well as</text>
  <text start="331.07" dur="6.24">they thought and all of the expansion</text>
  <text start="334.37" dur="6.51">that they were planning on that might</text>
  <text start="337.31" dur="6.03">come to an end we see rue 21 which is a</text>
  <text start="340.88" dur="5.7">clothing retailer they have declared</text>

  <text start="353.18" dur="5.28">of concerns list now when we look at</text>

  <text start="374.89" dur="5.8">8,000 stores that are going to close</text>
  <text start="377.66" dur="5.61">down and it looks like well we might be</text>
  <text start="380.69" dur="6.3">on track now Ford they&amp;#39;re going to cut</text>
  <text start="383.27" dur="6.21">10% of their workforce in North America</text>
  <text start="386.99" dur="6.39">and Asia and this is going to be their</text>
  <text start="389.48" dur="5.7">salaried employees and come October 1st</text>
  <text start="393.38" dur="4.02">this is when they&amp;#39;re going to start</text>
  <text start="395.18" dur="4.14">letting off individuals they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="397.4" dur="5.55">give them retirements but we can see</text>
  <text start="399.32" dur="6.12">that they&amp;#39;re shrinking their base right</text>
  <text start="402.95" dur="4.14">now and a lot of corporations are doing</text>
  <text start="405.44" dur="2.97">this a lot of corporations or laying</text>
  <text start="407.09" dur="3.45">individuals off thank god they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="408.41" dur="4.29">getting retirement packages but there</text>
  <text start="410.54" dur="4.38">are other corporations retail and many</text>
  <text start="412.7" dur="5.31">others that people are not getting any</text>
  <text start="414.92" dur="5.46">type of retirement whatsoever we see the</text>
  <text start="418.01" dur="6.44">housing industry well that took another</text>
  <text start="420.38" dur="6.84">hit there was a huge plunge in March and</text>
  <text start="424.45" dur="3.43">housing starts well they really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="427.22" dur="3.63">go anywhere</text>
  <text start="427.88" dur="5.64">so they expected this huge rebound in</text>
  <text start="430.85" dur="5.21">April now housing usually does very well</text>
  <text start="433.52" dur="6.12">in the spring in the summer months why</text>
  <text start="436.06" dur="6.6">because it&amp;#39;s warmer weather people get</text>
  <text start="439.64" dur="5.61">out everything is green flowering and</text>
  <text start="442.66" dur="4.21">people want to purchase their house in</text>
  <text start="445.25" dur="4.92">the warmer weather it&amp;#39;s a lot easier to</text>
  <text start="446.87" dur="5.84">move into the home it&amp;#39;s also a good time</text>
  <text start="450.17" dur="3.92">to establish your house right</text>
  <text start="452.71" dur="2.52">where school starts if you&amp;#39;re moving to</text>
  <text start="454.09" dur="3.51">a different area and you have children</text>
  <text start="455.23" dur="4.71">this is why they like to do it but what</text>
  <text start="457.6" dur="4.92">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now in April is that</text>
  <text start="459.94" dur="6">starts have dropped by 2.6 percent in</text>
  <text start="462.52" dur="7.14">April and after March is six point six</text>
  <text start="465.94" dur="6.12">percent dropped well this is not good</text>
  <text start="469.66" dur="5.25">whatsoever which shows us that things</text>
  <text start="472.06" dur="5.13">are deteriorating even further single</text>
  <text start="474.91" dur="3.54">family permits have dropped to 789</text>
  <text start="477.19" dur="3.54">thousand this is the lowest since</text>
  <text start="478.45" dur="5.01">November and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="480.73" dur="6.42">is that housing starts are now lower</text>
  <text start="483.46" dur="6.39">than they were two years ago so this is</text>
  <text start="487.15" dur="4.8">not a very good sign now the corporate</text>
  <text start="489.85" dur="4.35">media is out there and they are telling</text>
  <text start="491.95" dur="5.97">us that industrial production while it</text>
  <text start="494.2" dur="6.12">rose by 0.9 6% in April now this is the</text>
  <text start="497.92" dur="4.95">biggest move month-on-month</text>
  <text start="500.32" dur="6.62">since February of 2014 we&amp;#39;ve only seen</text>
  <text start="502.87" dur="7.59">declines but what is most ironic is that</text>
  <text start="506.94" dur="7.21">most of this came from the automotive</text>
  <text start="510.46" dur="6.09">production and we know that this will</text>
  <text start="514.15" dur="5.88">not be sustained it looks like there was</text>
  <text start="516.55" dur="6.41">this huge surge in automobiles that were</text>
  <text start="520.03" dur="6.39">manufactured and then stuffed into</text>
  <text start="522.96" dur="6.49">dealership lots and we know that has</text>
  <text start="526.42" dur="5.31">come to an end so what I&amp;#39;m expecting to</text>
  <text start="529.45" dur="5.04">see next month and the month after that</text>
  <text start="531.73" dur="5.49">is industrial production start to</text>
  <text start="534.49" dur="5.85">decline once again because we have a lot</text>
  <text start="537.22" dur="5.49">of cars coming off of leases and we can</text>
  <text start="540.34" dur="5.79">see there is an overabundance of cars</text>
  <text start="542.71" dur="6.36">and just like the GDP numbers with the</text>
  <text start="546.13" dur="4.32">export of soybeans and then right after</text>
  <text start="549.07" dur="3.36">that everything just fell off the cliff</text>
  <text start="550.45" dur="3.51">I think the same thing is going to</text>
  <text start="552.43" dur="3.81">happen once again with industrial</text>
  <text start="553.96" dur="3.54">production and we are not going to see</text>
  <text start="556.24" dur="3.96">this boost any more we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="557.5" dur="6.09">everything decline now we talked about</text>
  <text start="560.2" dur="6.48">China&amp;#39;s and Russia&amp;#39;s one belt one road</text>
  <text start="563.59" dur="5.97">trade system and many people are writing</text>
  <text start="566.68" dur="4.8">in telling me that you know it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="569.56" dur="5.67">of what Trump is doing because of his</text>
  <text start="571.48" dur="6.27">protectionism because of he doesn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="575.23" dur="5.1">the TPP he wants a different type of</text>
  <text start="577.75" dur="5.34">trade and he wants to renegotiate NAFTA</text>
  <text start="580.33" dur="5.13">or get rid of NAFTA and it&amp;#39;s boosting up</text>
  <text start="583.09" dur="3.489">the one belt one road system well this</text>
  <text start="585.46" dur="4.029">was in the works</text>
  <text start="586.579" dur="5.13">2013 and during this period of time</text>
  <text start="589.489" dur="4.801">Obama was trying to push through TPP</text>
  <text start="591.709" dur="5.04">where countries are in Europe where that</text>
  <text start="594.29" dur="6.479">was a TTIP which was very similar to the</text>
  <text start="596.749" dur="7.32">TPP they realized that this is not in</text>
  <text start="600.769" dur="5.88">any way good for our country it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="604.069" dur="3.99">benefit us who does a benefit oh that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="606.649" dur="4.701">right the corporations and the central</text>
  <text start="608.059" dur="6.45">banks that&amp;#39;s why those trade systems</text>
  <text start="611.35" dur="5.169">didn&amp;#39;t work out they kept it a secret</text>
  <text start="614.509" dur="4.02">they didn&amp;#39;t want anyone to know about it</text>
  <text start="616.519" dur="4.951">it was a court system that was going to</text>
  <text start="618.529" dur="4.41">lay up on top of the government court</text>
  <text start="621.47" dur="3.57">system which would overrule the</text>
  <text start="622.939" dur="5.101">government which means the countries</text>
  <text start="625.04" dur="5.31">would lose their sovereignty and China</text>
  <text start="628.04" dur="5.099">well they&amp;#39;ve been building actually if</text>
  <text start="630.35" dur="6.06">you go back to my reports Russia and</text>
  <text start="633.139" dur="5.401">China they have been preparing for the</text>
  <text start="636.41" dur="4.139">collapse of the economy they&amp;#39;ve built</text>
  <text start="638.54" dur="5.43">trading system they built</text>
  <text start="640.549" dur="6.57">gold exchanges they built payment</text>
  <text start="643.97" dur="6.989">systems they stopped using the dollar</text>
  <text start="647.119" dur="6.06">for trade they basically had bought as</text>
  <text start="650.959" dur="5.49">much gold as they possibly could because</text>
  <text start="653.179" dur="5.46">they understood what was coming so four</text>

  <text start="752.69" dur="4.73">economy no longer works as it did in the</text>

  <text start="757.42" dur="5.95">the central bank narrative is the</text>

  <text start="785.09" dur="6">people are being laid off the retail</text>
  <text start="786.74" dur="6.84">industry is being demolished we have a</text>

  <text start="795.35" dur="4.32">with retail and it&amp;#39;s not the weather but</text>
  <text start="797.93" dur="4.74">the inconvenient reality is that these</text>
  <text start="799.67" dur="6">can jeans their policies they don&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="802.67" dur="5.43">anymore so why is fiscal stimulus so</text>
  <text start="805.67" dur="3.21">important to them because this is all</text>
  <text start="808.1" dur="4.83">they have left</text>
  <text start="808.88" dur="6.44">if fiscal stimulus is withdrawn the</text>
  <text start="812.93" dur="5.6">economy immediately goes into a</text>
  <text start="815.32" dur="5.68">contraction it&amp;#39;s pretty much done and</text>
  <text start="818.53" dur="5.23">we&amp;#39;ve been at near zero interest rates</text>
  <text start="821" dur="5.01">for ten years of the supposed recovery</text>
  <text start="823.76" dur="4.26">central banks are terrified of pushing</text>
  <text start="826.01" dur="3.63">rates higher and they&amp;#39;re doing it very</text>
  <text start="828.02" dur="3.18">slowly quarter-point here quite a point</text>
  <text start="829.64" dur="3.36">there because they know if they raise</text>
  <text start="831.2" dur="3.87">the interest rates too fast boom it</text>
  <text start="833" dur="4.56">collapses and everyone points the finger</text>
  <text start="835.07" dur="4.02">at them and they realize that they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="837.56" dur="3.57">let this happen so they have to do it</text>
  <text start="839.09" dur="4.14">very slowly and they know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="841.13" dur="4.32">trigger point where the economy will</text>
  <text start="843.23" dur="3.72">start coming down they might already hit</text>
  <text start="845.45" dur="3.96">it because what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing since</text>
  <text start="846.95" dur="5.31">they raised it last time is a complete</text>
  <text start="849.41" dur="4.42">disaster in the retail market and things</text>
  <text start="852.26" dur="3.31">are not getting better all the hard</text>
  <text start="853.83" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s coming back is a complete</text>
  <text start="855.57" dur="5.97">disaster and when we look at the economy</text>
  <text start="858.09" dur="4.11">it completely no longer works I mean</text>
  <text start="861.54" dur="3.62">think about it</text>
  <text start="862.2" dur="7.44">productivity stagnating its declining</text>
  <text start="865.16" dur="7.51">personal income stagnating decline the</text>
  <text start="869.64" dur="6.18">federal debt continually moves up and up</text>
  <text start="872.67" dur="4.38">and up it&amp;#39;s through the roof today when</text>
  <text start="875.82" dur="4.5">we look at the private sector bank</text>
  <text start="877.05" dur="6.87">credit it is through the roof wealth</text>
  <text start="880.32" dur="6.03">inequality through the roof and they</text>
  <text start="883.92" dur="6.21">don&amp;#39;t have any other plan their plan is</text>
  <text start="886.35" dur="6.03">to crash the system blame it on another</text>
  <text start="890.13" dur="4.68">entity maybe Trump maybe another country</text>
  <text start="892.38" dur="5.25">it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter as long as they</text>
  <text start="894.81" dur="4.68">are not to blame because they want to</text>
  <text start="897.63" dur="3.87">restart the entire system over again</text>
  <text start="899.49" dur="5.1">they want you to believe that their</text>
  <text start="901.5" dur="6.81">system is the one to keep and this is</text>
  <text start="904.59" dur="6.81">why they&amp;#39;re pushing forward with the</text>
  <text start="908.31" dur="4.53">collapse now Trump from everything that</text>
  <text start="911.4" dur="3.93">I&amp;#39;m looking at he is doing the same</text>
  <text start="912.84" dur="4.47">thing and it is a race there is a battle</text>
  <text start="915.33" dur="4.08">between these two factions yes there are</text>
  <text start="917.31" dur="4.11">many smaller factions within it but</text>
  <text start="919.41" dur="4.77">there are two factions here that are</text>
  <text start="921.42" dur="6.45">battling it out right now for control of</text>
  <text start="924.18" dur="7.02">the entire system one thing that we need</text>
  <text start="927.87" dur="5.64">to understand is that the system no</text>
  <text start="931.2" dur="5.19">matter what way you look at it is going</text>
  <text start="933.51" dur="6.24">to come down and you need to be prepared</text>
  <text start="936.39" dur="5.1">for this economic apocalypse and I say</text>
  <text start="939.75" dur="3.18">apocalypse because it&amp;#39;s just like the</text>
  <text start="941.49" dur="3.72">retail apocalypse you&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="942.93" dur="3.9">that everyone is talking about where all</text>
  <text start="945.21" dur="3.96">these stores are closing down people</text>
  <text start="946.83" dur="5.49">losing jobs think about in economic</text>
  <text start="949.17" dur="4.89">apocalypse where corporations they have</text>
  <text start="952.32" dur="5.31">to lay off thousands of thousands of</text>
  <text start="954.06" dur="8.34">people people&amp;#39;s accounts are completely</text>
  <text start="957.63" dur="7.41">wiped out credit freezes up there are no</text>
  <text start="962.4" dur="5.34">deliveries to stores you can&amp;#39;t get fuel</text>
  <text start="965.04" dur="4.11">I mean does anyone remember going back</text>
  <text start="967.74" dur="3.42">and some people might not be old enough</text>
  <text start="969.15" dur="4.23">going back to the 70s when we were first</text>
  <text start="971.16" dur="3.93">coming on the system and they were</text>
  <text start="973.38" dur="4.8">negotiating deals with the Middle East</text>
  <text start="975.09" dur="6.21">and trying to set everything up and put</text>
  <text start="978.18" dur="5.13">the dollar on the oil because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="981.3" dur="3.66">coming off the gold standard and they</text>
  <text start="983.31" dur="4.05">made it made us believe that there was a</text>
  <text start="984.96" dur="4.77">shortage of oil that the earth</text>
  <text start="987.36" dur="4.439">didn&amp;#39;t have enough oil and we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="989.73" dur="3.81">if we&amp;#39;ll be able to supply any more oil</text>
  <text start="991.799" dur="4.35">and this is why they had the red and</text>
  <text start="993.54" dur="4.5">green flags they had an uneven license</text>
  <text start="996.149" dur="6.81">plate well that was all fake phony and</text>
  <text start="998.04" dur="7.529">false there was oil it just that the new</text>
  <text start="1002.959" dur="5.19">system was coming online but they had to</text>
  <text start="1005.569" dur="6.091">make it look like we didn&amp;#39;t have enough</text>
  <text start="1008.149" dur="7.49">oil and now here we are what 45 46 47</text>
  <text start="1011.66" dur="6.899">years later and we&amp;#39;ve had plenty of oil</text>
  <text start="1015.639" dur="4.93">so basically what they did back then was</text>
  <text start="1018.559" dur="4.2">to lie they didn&amp;#39;t want to tell you what</text>
  <text start="1020.569" dur="4.051">was really going on that we were coming</text>
  <text start="1022.759" dur="3.06">on to a new system and of course when</text>
  <text start="1024.62" dur="4.35">you come on to the new system</text>
  <text start="1025.819" dur="5.25">well dollars had to be printed that</text>
  <text start="1028.97" dur="3.39">means there was hyperinflation that</text>
  <text start="1031.069" dur="1.86">means they could raise the interest</text>
  <text start="1032.36" dur="3.419">rates</text>
  <text start="1032.929" dur="5.551">the value of a dollar decreased quite a</text>
  <text start="1035.779" dur="5.13">bit housing went up salaries went up and</text>
  <text start="1038.48" dur="4.829">people felt this is incredible well</text>
  <text start="1040.909" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;re on the back end now people zero</text>
  <text start="1043.309" dur="5.37">interest rate negative interest rate</text>
  <text start="1045.079" dur="5.761">salaries are declining we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1048.679" dur="4.261">everything freeze up we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1050.84" dur="4.23">inflation right now they can&amp;#39;t raise the</text>
  <text start="1052.94" dur="6.5">interest rates it&amp;#39;s completely the</text>
  <text start="1055.07" dur="6.87">opposite of what happened during the 70s</text>
  <text start="1059.44" dur="4.27">people couldn&amp;#39;t get jobs but as soon as</text>
  <text start="1061.94" dur="4.229">we hit the 80s things started to improve</text>
  <text start="1063.71" dur="4.86">because they got everything in line here</text>
  <text start="1066.169" dur="5.071">we&amp;#39;re on the back end everything is</text>
  <text start="1068.57" dur="6.209">going to completely collapse and there</text>
  <text start="1071.24" dur="6.45">no way out of this except for the</text>
  <text start="1074.779" dur="4.441">default that&amp;#39;s why Trump has been put</text>
  <text start="1077.69" dur="2.94">into this position you can hate him you</text>
  <text start="1079.22" dur="5.25">can like him it doesn&amp;#39;t matter he</text>
  <text start="1080.63" dur="6.539">doesn&amp;#39;t speak well he he&amp;#39;s not very</text>
  <text start="1084.47" dur="5.429">presidential the way everyone wants him</text>
  <text start="1087.169" dur="4.651">to be because he was there he&amp;#39;s in that</text>
  <text start="1089.899" dur="6.181">position I should say for a specific</text>
  <text start="1091.82" dur="8.43">reason the reason is to bring us through</text>
  <text start="1096.08" dur="8.55">this default to restructure the system</text>
  <text start="1100.25" dur="7.83">to call out people and to show the</text>
  <text start="1104.63" dur="6.69">American public what is really going on</text>
  <text start="1108.08" dur="6.15">that&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s rough he&amp;#39;s from New York</text>
  <text start="1111.32" dur="5.16">first of all that&amp;#39;s why he is like the</text>
  <text start="1114.23" dur="5.01">way he is because he is a guy who gets</text>
  <text start="1116.48" dur="4.42">things done and many people don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="1119.24" dur="4.87">them but that&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="1120.9" dur="5.46">who cares because it doesn&amp;#39;t matter who</text>
  <text start="1124.11" dur="4.44">was in office the system was going to</text>
  <text start="1126.36" dur="3.93">come down one way or another it might</text>
  <text start="1128.55" dur="3.12">have been covered up by a war and they</text>
  <text start="1130.29" dur="3.45">would be able to explain it off saying</text>
  <text start="1131.67" dur="3.69">that you have to sacrifice you we can</text>
  <text start="1133.74" dur="3.6">have products being delivered creditors</text>
  <text start="1135.36" dur="4.77">freezing up we can&amp;#39;t get fuel and they</text>
  <text start="1137.34" dur="5.37">would have a great explanation I rather</text>
  <text start="1140.13" dur="6.84">have a collapse without a war because</text>
  <text start="1142.71" dur="7.71">this way not as many people die and land</text>
  <text start="1146.97" dur="7.44">is not destroyed cities aren&amp;#39;t destroyed</text>
  <text start="1150.42" dur="6.72">so one thing is for sure the system is</text>
