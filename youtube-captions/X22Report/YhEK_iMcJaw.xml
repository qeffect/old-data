  <text start="34.84" dur="5.85">today&amp;#39;s title is economic collapse is</text>
  <text start="38.59" dur="6.09">like preparing for a natural disaster</text>
  <text start="40.69" dur="7.889">and what i mean by that is those places</text>
  <text start="44.68" dur="6.269">where there is a season for natural</text>
  <text start="48.579" dur="5.331">disasters let&amp;#39;s say florida for instance</text>
  <text start="50.949" dur="6.57">where you know the months starting in</text>
  <text start="53.91" dur="8.649">june to november our hurricane season</text>
  <text start="57.519" dur="7.411">you see in the stores supplies for a</text>
  <text start="62.559" dur="7.711">disaster and you&amp;#39;re supposed to stock up</text>
  <text start="64.93" dur="7.79">and be ready for the storm and some</text>
  <text start="70.27" dur="4.95">people stock up some people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="72.72" dur="4.39">sometimes there&amp;#39;s a storm sometimes</text>
  <text start="75.22" dur="4.649">there isn&amp;#39;t but when there is one and</text>
  <text start="77.11" dur="4.649">those people who have been prepared have</text>
  <text start="79.869" dur="4.32">everything ready have their generator</text>
  <text start="81.759" dur="4.561">have their food have their water have</text>
  <text start="84.189" dur="5.061">their batteries have their medical</text>
  <text start="86.32" dur="5.7">supplies and those who don&amp;#39;t prepare are</text>
  <text start="89.25" dur="5.5">rushing around at the last minute and</text>
  <text start="92.02" dur="5.7">most of the time the shelves are cleared</text>
  <text start="94.75" dur="4.829">out they can&amp;#39;t find anything and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="97.72" dur="4.439">sitting there going oh i should i should</text>
  <text start="99.579" dur="5.07">have prepared a lot sooner and that is</text>
  <text start="102.159" dur="4.681">just like the economic collapse because</text>
  <text start="104.649" dur="7.08">what&amp;#39;s happening is we know something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="106.84" dur="8.43">coming we know it&amp;#39;s inevitable and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="111.729" dur="6.301">better to slowly prepare than to be</text>
  <text start="115.27" dur="6.68">rushing around at the last minute and</text>
  <text start="118.03" dur="7.14">this is what i mean by this title okay</text>
  <text start="121.95" dur="7.27">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="125.17" dur="7.98">news here now Cyprus is having their</text>
  <text start="129.22" dur="7.26">final haircut and what that means is</text>
  <text start="133.15" dur="3.9">they are getting ready to take the last</text>
  <text start="136.48" dur="4.05">poor</text>
  <text start="137.05" dur="7.26">of the money that is frozen in the</text>
  <text start="140.53" dur="6.42">accounts of people in Cyprus and the</text>
  <text start="144.31" dur="7.05">central bank board of director reported</text>
  <text start="146.95" dur="6.84">a different figure saying about 50 but</text>
  <text start="151.36" dur="5.37">no more than sixty percent will be</text>
  <text start="153.79" dur="6.3">levied against the depositors or I</text>
  <text start="156.73" dur="6.06">should say creditors in the bangs we</text>
  <text start="160.09" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t really see it going higher than</text>
  <text start="162.79" dur="4.56">that it might even be a little bit lower</text>
  <text start="164.44" dur="6">but like I always say you know what</text>
  <text start="167.35" dur="5.7">happens every time they tell you that</text>
  <text start="170.44" dur="5.36">it&amp;#39;s going to be lower it it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="173.05" dur="7.02">the opposite it&amp;#39;s going to be higher and</text>
  <text start="175.8" dur="6.43">in addition to this the the bank of</text>
  <text start="180.07" dur="4.95">cyprus will be restructured under the</text>
  <text start="182.23" dur="5.25">troika&amp;#39;s watch and the select the second</text>
  <text start="185.02" dur="4.83">largest bank likee will be completely</text>
  <text start="187.48" dur="5.28">shut down and losses will be compensated</text>
  <text start="189.85" dur="8.07">for depositors with less than a hundred</text>
  <text start="192.76" dur="9.69">thousand euros and what is the forecast</text>
  <text start="197.92" dur="7.289">for Cyprus the economy is going to</text>
  <text start="202.45" dur="5.58">shrink by more than ten percent this</text>
  <text start="205.209" dur="5.341">year from what is going on and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="208.03" dur="6.33">not going to see any type of growth for</text>
  <text start="210.55" dur="5.88">quite a while now another thing that was</text>
  <text start="214.36" dur="6.33">interesting i found Bank of America</text>
  <text start="216.43" dur="6.18">intends to shed 20 branches but what</text>
  <text start="220.69" dur="6.81">they&amp;#39;ve been doing is they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="222.61" dur="6.39">selling off other branches and this goes</text>
  <text start="227.5" dur="4.53">on to say that the company is planning</text>
  <text start="229" dur="7.05">to divest 20 New York market branches to</text>
  <text start="232.03" dur="6.17">Berkshire bank but they have also been</text>
  <text start="236.05" dur="4.26">selling other branches like eight</text>
  <text start="238.2" dur="6.34">northeastern Pennsylvania branches to</text>
  <text start="240.31" dur="7.26">community bank and 51 branches to</text>
  <text start="244.54" dur="6.39">Eastern Washington Idaho Oregon and New</text>
  <text start="247.57" dur="6.12">Mexico to Washington federal and these</text>
  <text start="250.93" dur="4.74">transaction is expected to be completely</text>
  <text start="253.69" dur="7.26">and they completed all in the fourth</text>
  <text start="255.67" dur="8.07">quarter of 2013 and what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="260.95" dur="6.14">to do is they are trying to simplify</text>
  <text start="263.74" dur="6.69">their structure and strengthen their</text>
  <text start="267.09" dur="5.74">financials and this to me is very</text>
  <text start="270.43" dur="5.01">interesting because what does this tell</text>
  <text start="272.83" dur="5.22">us does this tell us that the bank is</text>
  <text start="275.44" dur="5.4">not strong enough to weather the</text>
  <text start="278.05" dur="5.25">economic collapse that is coming I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="280.84" dur="3.84">think any of the banks are and just from</text>
  <text start="283.3" dur="3.48">this where there it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="284.68" dur="4.95">trying to raise quite a bit of money</text>
  <text start="286.78" dur="5.31">because they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re selling all</text>
  <text start="289.63" dur="6.24">these branches and they&amp;#39;re receiving you</text>
  <text start="292.09" dur="6">know 11 million from this sale 20</text>
  <text start="295.87" dur="4.44">million from that sale 32 million from</text>
  <text start="298.09" dur="5.39">this sale and it looks like they are</text>
  <text start="300.31" dur="12.57">raising as much capital as they possibly</text>
  <text start="303.48" dur="11.38">can now JP Morgan is going to explore</text>
  <text start="312.88" dur="4.95">strategic alternatives for its physical</text>
  <text start="314.86" dur="6.3">commodities business and just today was</text>
  <text start="317.83" dur="5.52">announced that they&amp;#39;re going to pursue</text>
  <text start="321.16" dur="4.23">strategic alternative for its physical</text>
  <text start="323.35" dur="4.05">physical commodities business including</text>
  <text start="325.39" dur="3.6">its remaining holdings of commodities</text>
  <text start="327.4" dur="6.78">assets and its physical trading</text>
  <text start="328.99" dur="8.97">operations and you know where it looks</text>
  <text start="334.18" dur="8.67">like they&amp;#39;re giving up the the this part</text>
  <text start="337.96" dur="8.94">of their branch and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="342.85" dur="6.69">that JP Morgan has been emptying their</text>
  <text start="346.9" dur="5.58">gold vaults and I reported this on a</text>
  <text start="349.54" dur="5.64">couple of episodes back and they have</text>
  <text start="352.48" dur="7.64">reduced their gold holdings quite a bit</text>
  <text start="355.18" dur="10.19">and it&amp;#39;s very interesting that they are</text>
  <text start="360.12" dur="9.25">dumping this part of their business and</text>
  <text start="365.37" dur="6.43">what&amp;#39;s even more interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="369.37" dur="5.52">wall street journal reports that the</text>
  <text start="371.8" dur="4.86">department of judge justice has opened</text>
  <text start="374.89" dur="4.5">an initial probe into the metal</text>
  <text start="376.66" dur="5.1">warehousing industry and the Commodity</text>
  <text start="379.39" dur="3.87">Futures Trading Commission has also sent</text>
  <text start="381.76" dur="4.14">letters to some furs telling them</text>
  <text start="383.26" dur="4.26">through preserved documents in what is</text>
  <text start="385.9" dur="7.31">likely the beginning stages of an</text>
  <text start="387.52" dur="9.18">investigation of metals warehouse</text>
  <text start="393.21" dur="7.84">manipulate manipulation and this is</text>
  <text start="396.7" dur="7.029">against this is shocking Goldman Sachs</text>
  <text start="401.05" dur="4.69">and JP Morgan</text>
  <text start="403.729" dur="7.881">interesting how JP mooring morgan</text>
  <text start="405.74" dur="10.289">emptied its gold volts is dropping its</text>
  <text start="411.61" dur="7.329">physical commodity branches branch of</text>
  <text start="416.029" dur="8.6">their business and they are being probed</text>
  <text start="418.939" dur="9.03">in a metals warehouse manipulation</text>
  <text start="424.629" dur="6.25">investigation and this just goes to show</text>
  <text start="427.969" dur="7.41">you that something is definitely going</text>
  <text start="430.879" dur="6.93">on bank of america is taking steps to</text>
  <text start="435.379" dur="6.84">build up its financials and to bring in</text>
  <text start="437.809" dur="8.07">cash JP morgan emptied its gold vaults</text>
  <text start="442.219" dur="6.42">now there&amp;#39;s a probe going on and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="445.879" dur="5.25">selling off their branch so something is</text>
  <text start="448.639" dur="4.95">definitely in the works something is</text>
  <text start="451.129" dur="10.53">definitely happening and they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="453.589" dur="10.38">this quickly as of right now and as we</text>
  <text start="461.659" dur="4.74">we see there are definitely other things</text>
  <text start="463.969" dur="8.79">happening now like in the housing market</text>
  <text start="466.399" dur="9.6">again the housing market according to</text>
  <text start="472.759" dur="5.071">the home builders like dr horton which i</text>
  <text start="475.999" dur="4.59">mentioned before and i think was last</text>
  <text start="477.83" dur="6.269">episode they are down thirty percent</text>
  <text start="480.589" dur="7.591">from its recent highs and also pulte</text>
  <text start="484.099" dur="5.91">homes is also down and by the fed</text>
  <text start="488.18" dur="3.69">keeping the interest rates at zero and</text>
  <text start="490.009" dur="4.111">giving institutions access to various</text>
  <text start="491.87" dur="5.43">lending windows the fed gave large</text>
  <text start="494.12" dur="6.779">financial firms like Blackrock and other</text>
  <text start="497.3" dur="7.489">hedge hedge fund firms the ability to</text>
  <text start="500.899" dur="7.5">snatch up tens of thousands of homes and</text>
  <text start="504.789" dur="7.29">you know this put a false floor beneath</text>
  <text start="508.399" dur="7.111">housing prices and the prep the how the</text>
  <text start="512.079" dur="5.62">the price of houses are going up which</text>
  <text start="515.51" dur="4.98">is making it unaffordable to the</text>
  <text start="517.699" dur="5.13">everyday American where they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="520.49" dur="4.529">purchase any of these homes because the</text>
  <text start="522.829" dur="5.041">Fed was trying to inflate the housing</text>
  <text start="525.019" dur="5.731">bubble and the mortgage rates are going</text>
  <text start="527.87" dur="8.63">up people are becoming unemployed or</text>
  <text start="530.75" dur="9.32">underemployed and this fake</text>
  <text start="536.5" dur="9">housing boom is starting to fall apart</text>
  <text start="540.07" dur="8.07">and the new home builders are starting</text>
  <text start="545.5" dur="6.72">to realize this applications mortgage</text>
  <text start="548.14" dur="7.02">applications are are plunging people are</text>
  <text start="552.22" dur="5.97">starting to switch to arms which is a</text>
  <text start="555.16" dur="7.38">much lower interest rate for like three</text>
  <text start="558.19" dur="8.66">to five years and this is very similar</text>
  <text start="562.54" dur="8.55">to 2007 it feels like we&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="566.85" dur="10.66">replay or a deja vu of what is happening</text>
  <text start="571.09" dur="9.81">here now as we know the u.s. debt</text>
  <text start="577.51" dur="7.44">ceiling just passed the 16 point seven</text>
  <text start="580.9" dur="7.98">trillion dollars by 38 million and it</text>
  <text start="584.95" dur="8.16">doesn&amp;#39;t really matter the Congress has</text>
  <text start="588.88" dur="10.68">raised the debt ceiling 14 times now the</text>
  <text start="593.11" dur="9.69">only way that they can keep the debt</text>
  <text start="599.56" dur="6.9">where it is is they would have to shut</text>
  <text start="602.8" dur="5.82">down pretty much everything even with</text>
  <text start="606.46" dur="4.92">the sequester where you know Obama went</text>
  <text start="608.62" dur="3.69">around carrying on oh my god this is</text>
  <text start="611.38" dur="2.88">gonna you know you&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="612.31" dur="3.96">fireworks anything that had to do with</text>
  <text start="614.26" dur="5">the people that&amp;#39;s where they did the</text>
  <text start="616.27" dur="5.94">sequester to show you that that you know</text>
  <text start="619.26" dur="5.14">that is really affecting you but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="622.21" dur="5.67">funny is they had this sequester but</text>
  <text start="624.4" dur="6.27">guess what the amount of spending for</text>
  <text start="627.88" dur="6.36">everything else kept going up the debt</text>
  <text start="630.67" dur="6.18">kept going up it it didn&amp;#39;t even slow</text>
  <text start="634.24" dur="4.5">down and even when they have this</text>
  <text start="636.85" dur="4.68">argument about cutting this cutting that</text>
  <text start="638.74" dur="5.73">the debt will continue to rise because</text>
  <text start="641.53" dur="6.42">the government is not bringing in enough</text>
  <text start="644.47" dur="6.3">revenue to cover the payments now to</text>
  <text start="647.95" dur="5.31">cover all the programs and to cover all</text>
  <text start="650.77" dur="6.3">the military actions that they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="653.26" dur="7.44">right now to set up for the upcoming war</text>
  <text start="657.07" dur="5.519">and it&amp;#39;s it doesn&amp;#39;t matter they can have</text>
  <text start="660.7" dur="3.6">all this argument they want guess what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="662.589" dur="3.241">going to happen they&amp;#39;re going to raise</text>
  <text start="664.3" dur="3.33">the debt ceiling of course they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="665.83" dur="3.84">to get whatever thing they want it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="667.63" dur="2.59">it&amp;#39;s immaterial and the debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="669.67" dur="2.71">will be</text>
  <text start="670.22" dur="3.78">and that will be the end and pretty soon</text>
  <text start="672.38" dur="5.24">we&amp;#39;ll be up to we&amp;#39;ll be talking about</text>
  <text start="674" dur="7.11">this when we hit 17 point five trillion</text>
  <text start="677.62" dur="6.4">just like in the beginning in 2008 it</text>
  <text start="681.11" dur="4.59">was at between nine and ten trillion now</text>
  <text start="684.02" dur="4.65">here we are we talked about it we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="685.7" dur="8.85">12 when we&amp;#39;re at 14 now here we are at</text>
  <text start="688.67" dur="8.67">16.7 it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s meaningless now I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="694.55" dur="5.25">always said this that the on Fridays</text>
  <text start="697.34" dur="5.28">I&amp;#39;ve always noticed that the stock</text>
  <text start="699.8" dur="8.01">market always has to finish in a</text>
  <text start="702.62" dur="7.55">positive light and today zerohedge even</text>
  <text start="707.81" dur="6.12">put this on there a hundred point a</text>
  <text start="710.17" dur="6.31">vertical ramp closes doubt green I mean</text>
  <text start="713.93" dur="6.36">I have the graph here on the x 22 report</text>
  <text start="716.48" dur="6.15">com site on this page and you see it it</text>
  <text start="720.29" dur="3.93">goes like straight up because it was</text>
  <text start="722.63" dur="4.23">down quite a bit about a hundred and</text>
  <text start="724.22" dur="5.49">forty points and all of a sudden those</text>
  <text start="726.86" dur="4.68">you know high frequencies traders and</text>
  <text start="729.71" dur="5.01">the plunge protection said oh we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="731.54" dur="5.28">end on the weekend in the red we got to</text>
  <text start="734.72" dur="4.38">push this up up into the green and</text>
  <text start="736.82" dur="9.57">that&amp;#39;s what they did and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="739.1" dur="9.72">amazing now central banks vote for gold</text>
  <text start="746.39" dur="6.96">due to sovereign and currency concerns</text>
  <text start="748.82" dur="7.17">very interesting and guess what central</text>
  <text start="753.35" dur="5.76">banks remain net buyers of gold last</text>
  <text start="755.99" dur="5.97">month as seen in the IMF data released</text>
  <text start="759.11" dur="6.56">and what&amp;#39;s interesting is that Russia</text>
  <text start="761.96" dur="8.31">Greece Ukraine Kazakhstan Crick&amp;#39;s expand</text>
  <text start="765.67" dur="9.55">belorus China all increased their gold</text>
  <text start="770.27" dur="7.62">holdings for instance Russia now has the</text>
  <text start="775.22" dur="5.01">seventh largest gold holdings and it</text>
  <text start="777.89" dur="5.67">just added another nine thousand ounces</text>
  <text start="780.23" dur="5.88">to it to its holdings China doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="783.56" dur="4.98">really report it but you know from all</text>
  <text start="786.11" dur="5.99">reports they are continually adding</text>
  <text start="788.54" dur="7.47">because they are looking to be the</text>
  <text start="792.1" dur="8.94">reserve currency of the world backed by</text>

  <text start="940.97" dur="5.789">what is happening it is just falling</text>
  <text start="943.399" dur="5.43">apart and we saw this if we compare this</text>
  <text start="946.759" dur="4.77">back to the Great Depression we are</text>
  <text start="948.829" dur="5.521">seeing the same thing had happened it</text>
  <text start="951.529" dur="7.261">started in Europe Europe was struggling</text>
  <text start="954.35" dur="7.469">that&amp;#39;s where you know in in Germany they</text>
  <text start="958.79" dur="8.43">had that in y Mar the inflation we saw</text>
  <text start="961.819" dur="9.36">the build-up of Hitler and the Germans</text>
  <text start="967.22" dur="5.88">and we saw many countries struggling but</text>
  <text start="971.179" dur="3.75">again when we look back at America all</text>
  <text start="973.1" dur="3.51">eyes on the stock market they were</text>
  <text start="974.929" dur="3.78">hitting all-time highs and back then it</text>
  <text start="976.61" dur="5.099">was like 400 points with the all-time</text>
  <text start="978.709" dur="5.73">highs in America but the rest of the</text>
  <text start="981.709" dur="4.531">economy it was a disconnect and the rest</text>
  <text start="984.439" dur="5.43">of the economy was completely falling</text>
  <text start="986.24" dur="6.779">apart during the same time and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="989.869" dur="6.45">seeing the same thing happened now there</text>
  <text start="993.019" dur="6.87">is a complete disconnect and we can see</text>

  <text start="1019.72" dur="8.91">what&amp;#39;s interesting is that while America</text>
  <text start="1024.64" dur="6.899">the empire of America is waging war on</text>

  <text start="1063.65" dur="4.67">what China is doing which is very</text>
  <text start="1066.35" dur="5.04">interesting instead of waging war</text>
  <text start="1068.32" dur="5.2">they&amp;#39;re making deals with all these</text>
  <text start="1071.39" dur="5.46">different countries they&amp;#39;re making deals</text>

  <text start="1110.86" dur="6.22">fighting everywhere just to keep the</text>
  <text start="1115.22" dur="3.66">reserve currency and look at the</text>
  <text start="1117.08" dur="7.05">difference and you know what happens</text>
  <text start="1118.88" dur="9.87">when a empire that is I hate to say it</text>

  <text start="1330.96" dur="8.79">asked and we need them now and this is</text>
  <text start="1335.309" dur="6.571">very interesting that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1339.75" dur="4.83">opposition leaders on their three-day</text>
  <text start="1341.88" dur="4.98">visit to the US have urged Washington to</text>

  <text start="1365.309" dur="5.521">they really need to get this war started</text>
  <text start="1367.5" dur="6.39">before September 30th and the reason for</text>
  <text start="1370.83" dur="6.959">this is because funding for the program</text>
  <text start="1373.89" dur="8.009">will cease with the end of the US fiscal</text>
  <text start="1377.789" dur="6">year which is September 30th and what</text>
  <text start="1381.899" dur="4.681">they would have to do is they would have</text>
  <text start="1383.789" dur="4.471">to go through the US Congress and they</text>
  <text start="1386.58" dur="6.54">would have to make their case again and</text>
  <text start="1388.26" dur="8.279">get reapproved for everything again so</text>
  <text start="1393.12" dur="8.929">what does this tell us this tells us</text>
  <text start="1396.539" dur="10.711">that something major is going to happen</text>
  <text start="1402.049" dur="10.031">prior to September 30th where it will</text>
  <text start="1407.25" dur="7.559">get the US deep deep into the war with</text>
  <text start="1412.08" dur="6.81">Syria and the only way they can pull</text>
  <text start="1414.809" dur="9.09">this off is with some type of false flag</text>

  <text start="1430.789" dur="7.841">Congress and the people beg the Obama</text>
  <text start="1434.61" dur="6.51">administration to go to war and the only</text>
  <text start="1438.63" dur="5.159">way they can have this done is if they</text>
  <text start="1441.12" dur="6.419">pull something off that is really</text>
  <text start="1443.789" dur="5.671">gruesome and it hurts a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1447.539" dur="4.831">and they need to do this before</text>
