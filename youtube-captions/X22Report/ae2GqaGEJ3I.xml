  <text start="149.36" dur="6.599">we know the corporate media is making a</text>
  <text start="152" dur="6.93">very big deal about Flynn speaking to</text>
  <text start="155.959" dur="5.101">the Russians and of course this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="158.93" dur="3.39">what he was brought up on charges about</text>
  <text start="161.06" dur="4.07">it was he was brought up on charges</text>
  <text start="162.32" dur="7.07">about lying because as we said before</text>
  <text start="165.13" dur="7.18">other individuals who are coming into</text>
  <text start="169.39" dur="4.81">the White House where they were just</text>
  <text start="172.31" dur="5.519">elected in their part of administration</text>
  <text start="174.2" dur="7.05">they needed to speak to diplomats in</text>
  <text start="177.829" dur="6.181">different countries and we see right now</text>
  <text start="181.25" dur="4.5">there are many individuals coming out</text>
  <text start="184.01" dur="5.1">saying yeah this is</text>
  <text start="185.75" dur="5.34">absolutely normal Jack Matlock the four</text>
  <text start="189.11" dur="4.98">year four year US ambassador to the</text>
  <text start="191.09" dur="6.03">Soviet Union from 1987 and 1991 at the</text>
  <text start="194.09" dur="5.99">time that the USSR fell rights the</text>
  <text start="197.12" dur="5.49">following as one who spent a 35-year</text>
  <text start="200.08" dur="4.69">diplomatic career working to open up the</text>
  <text start="202.61" dur="4.23">Soviet Union and to make communication</text>
  <text start="204.77" dur="3.6">between our diplomats and ordinary</text>
  <text start="206.84" dur="3.63">citizens in normal practice</text>
  <text start="208.37" dur="4.02">I find the attitude of much of our</text>
  <text start="210.47" dur="6">political establishment and some of our</text>
  <text start="212.39" dur="7.38">once respected media outlets quite</text>
  <text start="216.47" dur="5.58">incomprehensible what in the world is</text>
  <text start="219.77" dur="4.71">wrong with consulting a foreign embassy</text>
  <text start="222.05" dur="4.44">about ways to improve relations anyone</text>
  <text start="224.48" dur="4.94">who aspires to advise an American</text>
  <text start="226.49" dur="5.82">president should just do that michael</text>
  <text start="229.42" dur="5.86">mcdowell the US ambassador to Russia</text>
  <text start="232.31" dur="4.89">under President Obama also confirms that</text>
  <text start="235.28" dur="3.72">the Russian ambassador&amp;#39;s contacts with</text>
  <text start="237.2" dur="5.07">the US officials under an incoming</text>
  <text start="239" dur="6.959">administration are not unusual it is</text>
  <text start="242.27" dur="6.9">normal for presidential candidates to</text>
  <text start="245.959" dur="6.56">insert themselves into global events by</text>
  <text start="249.17" dur="6.81">dialing up heads of state in fact Obama</text>
  <text start="252.519" dur="6.911">did pretty much the same thing multiple</text>
  <text start="255.98" dur="7.47">times no less as a candidate during the</text>
  <text start="259.43" dur="6.39">2008 campaign Obama like Romney embarked</text>
  <text start="263.45" dur="5.55">on a foreign trip as a candidate meeting</text>
  <text start="265.82" dur="6.36">face to face with leaders such as Afghan</text>
  <text start="269" dur="5.75">President Hamid Karzai German Chancellor</text>
  <text start="272.18" dur="5.87">Angela Merkel Iraqi Prime Minister</text>
  <text start="274.75" dur="7.59">al-maliki and Israeli prime minister</text>
  <text start="278.05" dur="6.64">who&amp;#39;d Albert and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="282.34" dur="5.53">this isn&amp;#39;t the problem</text>
  <text start="284.69" dur="5.34">this isn&amp;#39;t Russian collusion this is why</text>
  <text start="287.87" dur="4.77">they couldn&amp;#39;t bring Flynn up on these</text>
  <text start="290.03" dur="5.49">charges because there&amp;#39;s nothing there</text>
  <text start="292.64" dur="5.85">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="295.52" dur="4.95">FBI agent that was suspended or demoted</text>
  <text start="298.49" dur="5.12">where they&amp;#39;re out there saying that he</text>
  <text start="300.47" dur="6.54">was texting antitrump messages which is</text>
  <text start="303.61" dur="5.83">ridiculous that&amp;#39;s not why he was removed</text>
  <text start="307.01" dur="4.68">because most of the FBI who are working</text>
  <text start="309.44" dur="4.86">for Mueller or anti-trump so let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="311.69" dur="5.01">get that out of the way we know that he</text>
  <text start="314.3" dur="4.38">leaked stuff to the corporate media we</text>
  <text start="316.7" dur="6.089">also come to find out</text>
  <text start="318.68" dur="9.12">that he did something else he changed</text>
  <text start="322.789" dur="8.13">the wording in former FBI director james</text>
  <text start="327.8" dur="5.089">comey z&amp;#39; memo that cleared hillary</text>
  <text start="330.919" dur="5.31">clinton of mishandling classified</text>
  <text start="332.889" dur="6.581">information and as more information</text>
  <text start="336.229" dur="5.611">comes out were finding out that he was</text>
  <text start="339.47" dur="4.74">involved in a lot of different things</text>
  <text start="341.84" dur="5.91">that he shouldn&amp;#39;t been doing we also</text>
  <text start="344.21" dur="6.239">come to find out that the NSA&amp;#39;s mcmaster</text>
  <text start="347.75" dur="6.419">he authorized surveillance of Bannon and</text>
  <text start="350.449" dur="5.461">the Trump family and we see right now</text>
  <text start="354.169" dur="3.451">there&amp;#39;s a former CIA paramilitary</text>
  <text start="355.91" dur="4.83">officer and a member of the Trump</text>
  <text start="357.62" dur="4.889">transition team John R Maguire he</text>
  <text start="360.74" dur="3.51">revealed during a fundraising meeting</text>
  <text start="362.509" dur="3.871">for an intelligence gathering operation</text>
  <text start="364.25" dur="4.47">Afghanistan the National Security</text>
  <text start="366.38" dur="4.95">Adviser HR McMaster authorized</text>
  <text start="368.72" dur="4.83">surveillance of Steve Bannon and Trump</text>
  <text start="371.33" dur="5.519">family members including Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="373.55" dur="7.649">jr. and Eric Trump and we see right now</text>
  <text start="376.849" dur="10.411">that all these individuals they were</text>
  <text start="381.199" dur="11.881">spying on Trump and his administration</text>
  <text start="387.26" dur="9.39">and yes they had no warrant they were</text>
  <text start="393.08" dur="6.269">unmasking individuals and we see that</text>
  <text start="396.65" dur="6.48">all this information is coming out now</text>
  <text start="399.349" dur="7.651">and as we move forward we&amp;#39;re gonna find</text>
  <text start="403.13" dur="5.879">out a lot more and again they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="407" dur="5.46">to keep their power they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="409.009" dur="5.491">give their power up and this is why they</text>
  <text start="412.46" dur="5.389">were trying to get whatever they</text>
  <text start="414.5" dur="6.659">possibly could on Trump on his son&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="417.849" dur="5.141">anyone but they couldn&amp;#39;t find anything</text>
  <text start="421.159" dur="3.991">if they had it it would have been all</text>
  <text start="422.99" dur="5.04">over the place everyone would have been</text>
  <text start="425.15" dur="4.98">brought up on charges already and this</text>
  <text start="428.03" dur="3.569">is why Mueller he can&amp;#39;t find anything</text>
  <text start="430.13" dur="5.129">this is why he had to come up with lying</text>
  <text start="431.599" dur="6.391">that&amp;#39;s all he has we see the u.s. b-1b</text>
  <text start="435.259" dur="4.921">bomber it&amp;#39;s flying over the Korean</text>

  <text start="491.61" dur="4.97">days ago where if Trump was gonna come</text>
  <text start="493.11" dur="7.73">out and say that Jerusalem was the</text>
  <text start="496.58" dur="7.03">capital of Israel and back in 1995</text>
  <text start="500.84" dur="4.57">Congress passed the Jerusalem embassy</text>
  <text start="503.61" dur="3.33">act requiring the movement of the</text>
  <text start="505.41" dur="3.78">American Embassy from Tel Aviv to</text>
  <text start="506.94" dur="4.74">Jerusalem and the act said that</text>
  <text start="509.19" dur="5.37">Jerusalem should be undivided and be</text>
  <text start="511.68" dur="4.62">recognized as the capital of Israel the</text>
  <text start="514.56" dur="5.13">legislation passed fifty three to five</text>
  <text start="516.3" dur="6.99">in the Senate and 374 to 37 in the House</text>
  <text start="519.69" dur="5.82">of Representatives now once again there</text>
  <text start="523.29" dur="4.98">are many countries out there saying that</text>
  <text start="525.51" dur="4.44">this is not a good thing I personally</text>
  <text start="528.27" dur="3.93">don&amp;#39;t believe that this is a good thing</text>
  <text start="529.95" dur="5.79">there are many countries that are</text>
  <text start="532.2" dur="5.73">involved in Jerusalem and we see right</text>
  <text start="535.74" dur="4.8">now that Israel right now is bracing for</text>
  <text start="537.93" dur="6.27">demonstrations in the West Bank the Gaza</text>
  <text start="540.54" dur="5.1">Strip and East Jerusalem other countries</text>
  <text start="544.2" dur="4.08">are out there saying that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="545.64" dur="4.56">to protest all of this and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="548.28" dur="4.38">starting to hear from Turkey we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="561.6" dur="5.87">saying that this is not a good thing</text>
  <text start="563.13" dur="8.73">now before Trump went ahead and did this</text>
  <text start="567.47" dur="8.56">he spoke to many different leaders now</text>
  <text start="571.86" dur="7.62">of course many presidents before him did</text>
  <text start="576.03" dur="5.7">not go ahead and say okay Jerusalem is</text>
  <text start="579.48" dur="3.63">the capital of Israel we&amp;#39;ll be moving</text>
  <text start="581.73" dur="3.02">the embassy but he&amp;#39;s not moving the</text>
  <text start="583.11" dur="4.52">embassy just yet</text>
  <text start="584.75" dur="5.49">and we need to look closely at this to</text>
  <text start="587.63" dur="5.31">see why this is happening now this could</text>
  <text start="590.24" dur="5.73">spark something big in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="592.94" dur="5.28">maybe this was the plan maybe this is</text>
  <text start="595.97" dur="6.33">what they wanted to happen maybe this is</text>
  <text start="598.22" dur="6.66">the event where these countries go off</text>
  <text start="602.3" dur="8.01">the edge something happens and war</text>
  <text start="604.88" dur="9.75">breaks out or maybe something else was</text>
  <text start="610.31" dur="8.67">done here maybe there was a deal that</text>
  <text start="614.63" dur="5.36">was struck with Israel because think</text>
  <text start="618.98" dur="6.38">about it</text>
  <text start="619.99" dur="10.3">Syria is lost Libya is lost</text>
  <text start="625.36" dur="6.49">Lebanon is lost and there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="630.29" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re gonna be starting a war with a</text>
  <text start="631.85" dur="4.38">ram it&amp;#39;s not going to happen</text>
  <text start="633.65" dur="6.45">we know that Israel and the coalition</text>
  <text start="636.23" dur="7.44">forces they funded the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="640.1" dur="5.28">they supported them and we understand</text>
  <text start="643.67" dur="8.3">that they also supported the moderate</text>
  <text start="645.38" dur="10.16">rebels was this done was this a deal</text>
  <text start="651.97" dur="6.31">that they made where they said listen</text>
  <text start="655.54" dur="6.64">we&amp;#39;ll say jewelz Jerusalem is the</text>
  <text start="658.28" dur="7.65">capital of Israel hands off of the</text>
  <text start="662.18" dur="6.72">Middle East no more Wars because as we</text>
  <text start="665.93" dur="6.51">can see Syria is lost there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="668.9" dur="8.52">they can do right now now the other side</text>
  <text start="672.44" dur="9.54">of this is that Israel well they own</text>
  <text start="677.42" dur="7.83">Trump and they&amp;#39;re telling Trump this is</text>
  <text start="681.98" dur="6.75">what we want but from Trump&amp;#39;s actions in</text>
  <text start="685.25" dur="4.92">the past it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like this and I</text>
  <text start="688.73" dur="3.78">know that there are leaders out there</text>
  <text start="690.17" dur="4.65">that are not happy with this so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="692.51" dur="4.68">going to have to see how this plays out</text>
  <text start="694.82" dur="5.55">now Trump might be controlled by Israel</text>
  <text start="697.19" dur="5.76">don&amp;#39;t get me wrong here where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="700.37" dur="9.2">bought and paid for and this was already</text>
  <text start="702.95" dur="10.2">pre-done way before or this was a plan</text>
  <text start="709.57" dur="6.46">to stop what was happening in the Middle</text>
  <text start="713.15" dur="5.01">East because there&amp;#39;s nothing else the</text>

  <text start="762.439" dur="3.811">know there&amp;#39;s news reports out there</text>
  <text start="763.85" dur="4.89">saying that the u.s. is never leaving</text>
  <text start="766.25" dur="6.029">but that&amp;#39;s ridiculous</text>
  <text start="768.74" dur="6.599">under international law and with Russia</text>
  <text start="772.279" dur="5.1">with China with Syria and the rest of</text>
  <text start="775.339" dur="4.23">the country saying okay there is no</text>
  <text start="777.379" dur="5.58">reason for you to be in here because if</text>
  <text start="779.569" dur="7.531">they stay there it&amp;#39;s an invading force</text>
  <text start="782.959" dur="6.901">because Assad is an elected leader Assad</text>
  <text start="787.1" dur="5.039">is a leader of a sovereign country and</text>
  <text start="789.86" dur="4.279">the United States was not invited in</text>
  <text start="792.139" dur="6.18">this country and now they have</text>
  <text start="794.139" dur="6.781">absolutely no reason to be there so we</text>
  <text start="798.319" dur="6.721">can see that things are winding down and</text>
  <text start="800.92" dur="5.62">the Cabal they have nothing left so</text>
  <text start="805.04" dur="3.989">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to see how this all</text>
  <text start="806.54" dur="6.479">plays out in the Middle East because</text>
  <text start="809.029" dur="6.06">this was just not done just just to do</text>
  <text start="813.019" dur="4.49">it there&amp;#39;s always something in the</text>
  <text start="815.089" dur="5.521">background that we&amp;#39;re not seeing and</text>
  <text start="817.509" dur="5.291">from what I&amp;#39;m saying it looks like there</text>
  <text start="820.61" dur="4.919">there were deals that were put into</text>
  <text start="822.8" dur="5.94">place to stop what was going on in the</text>
  <text start="825.529" dur="6.331">Middle East and remember this law has</text>
  <text start="828.74" dur="7.11">been on the books since 95 and those who</text>
  <text start="831.86" dur="7.469">were in power used it to you know</text>
  <text start="835.85" dur="5.64">maneuver and to control and to say</text>
  <text start="839.329" dur="4.891">listen we&amp;#39;ll help you with this will</text>
  <text start="841.49" dur="4.649">make Jerusalem the capital and then they</text>
  <text start="844.22" dur="3.33">never did and then the next president</text>
  <text start="846.139" dur="3.271">came in they did the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="847.55" dur="3.89">because they needed that little they</text>
  <text start="849.41" dur="5.45">need that little control</text>
  <text start="851.44" dur="5.25">to keep Israel you know in line or</text>
  <text start="854.86" dur="3.51">whatever they needed Israel to do and I</text>
  <text start="856.69" dur="3.54">know a lot of people think that you know</text>
  <text start="858.37" dur="4.98">oh no they&amp;#39;re completely controlled but</text>
  <text start="860.23" dur="6.51">it goes both ways and we see right now</text>
  <text start="863.35" dur="6.66">that this might have been the point in</text>
  <text start="866.74" dur="5.25">time where they said okay we need to</text>
  <text start="870.01" dur="5.13">bring this to an end and we need to make</text>
  <text start="871.99" dur="5.25">agreements here and this is why it was</text>
  <text start="875.14" dur="4.8">done now time will tell</text>
  <text start="877.24" dur="6.12">maybe the Middle East will break out in</text>
  <text start="879.94" dur="8.42">war maybe the countries of Iran</text>
  <text start="883.36" dur="8.82">maybe the countries of Turkey Iraq Syria</text>
  <text start="888.36" dur="5.74">Palestine and the rest maybe they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="892.18" dur="6.26">agree with this and they started war or</text>
  <text start="894.1" dur="6.68">maybe Israel goes in and attacks Gaza</text>
  <text start="898.44" dur="4.96">we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see but I think</text>
  <text start="900.78" dur="5.95">there was a deal made in the background</text>
  <text start="903.4" dur="5.76">to pull troops away stopped going into</text>
  <text start="906.73" dur="5.94">Syria stop firing missiles into Syria</text>
  <text start="909.16" dur="6.3">there&amp;#39;ll be no war with Iran you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="912.67" dur="4.59">gonna use Lebanon as a proxy to get into</text>
  <text start="915.46" dur="4.41">war and I believe this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="917.26" dur="6.24">happening right now and we see at this</text>
  <text start="919.87" dur="6.33">point that everything that we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="923.5" dur="6.87">at right now is the destruction of the</text>
  <text start="926.2" dur="7.86">Cabal where they have lost the Middle</text>
  <text start="930.37" dur="6.72">East completely and we see that Russia</text>
  <text start="934.06" dur="6.36">and China they are gaining ground in the</text>
  <text start="937.09" dur="6.57">Middle East and everything is changing</text>
  <text start="940.42" dur="5.04">at this point and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="943.66" dur="4.74">economic situation when we look at the</text>
  <text start="945.46" dur="5.16">geopolitical political situation we see</text>
  <text start="948.4" dur="4.2">there is many many changes in the wind</text>
  <text start="950.62" dur="5.4">here we see that the United States</text>
  <text start="952.6" dur="5.64">cannot survive on its own economically I</text>
  <text start="956.02" dur="4.14">mean you just can&amp;#39;t create currency and</text>
  <text start="958.24" dur="4.62">create currency and create currency and</text>
  <text start="960.16" dur="5.61">have no trade have no manufacturing and</text>
  <text start="962.86" dur="4.65">people keep losing jobs where you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="965.77" dur="4.5">even purchase them from stores because</text>
  <text start="967.51" dur="7.4">we can see the toll it&amp;#39;s taking on the</text>
  <text start="970.27" dur="7.86">country retail is apocalyptic</text>
  <text start="974.91" dur="5.62">manufacturing is apocalyptic and all of</text>
  <text start="978.13" dur="4.65">it is completely accelerating to the</text>
  <text start="980.53" dur="4.25">downside and eventually what happens is</text>
  <text start="982.78" dur="4.31">you go bankrupt this is what</text>
  <text start="984.78" dur="4.89">as the corporations I mean the country</text>
  <text start="987.09" dur="4.14">is really no different you can borrow</text>
  <text start="989.67" dur="3.63">and borrow and borrow and create</text>
  <text start="991.23" dur="4.83">currency give yourself more and more</text>
  <text start="993.3" dur="5.31">debt eventually what happens there&amp;#39;s is</text>
  <text start="996.06" dur="3.06">a breaking point and this is where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="998.61" dur="4.41">headed</text>
  <text start="999.12" dur="6.87">yes they can run the the debt level up</text>
  <text start="1003.02" dur="4.59">to 90 trillion but who&amp;#39;s gonna believe</text>
  <text start="1005.99" dur="4.73">that the u.s. is ever gonna be able to</text>
  <text start="1007.61" dur="6.6">pay all this back how are they gonna pay</text>
  <text start="1010.72" dur="6.13">for the payments even with zero interest</text>
  <text start="1014.21" dur="3.81">if everyone is losing a job and the tax</text>
  <text start="1016.85" dur="4.2">receipts coming to the government</text>
  <text start="1018.02" dur="5.04">continually declines there&amp;#39;s always a</text>
  <text start="1021.05" dur="3.33">breaking point and what they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="1023.06" dur="2.49">nervous about is that we&amp;#39;re reaching</text>
  <text start="1024.38" dur="4.53">that breaking point</text>
  <text start="1025.55" dur="5.46">we&amp;#39;re very close to it and as more</text>
  <text start="1028.91" dur="5.07">people lose jobs and mores more</text>
  <text start="1031.01" dur="5.55">corporations you know lose revenue and</text>
  <text start="1033.98" dur="5.97">profits and retail closes down and</text>
  <text start="1036.56" dur="4.74">everything falls apart we&amp;#39;ll be right</text>
  <text start="1039.95" dur="3.45">there because think about it a couple</text>
  <text start="1041.3" dur="4.95">years ago we said retail is going to</text>
  <text start="1043.4" dur="4.11">fall apart and look what happened we</text>
  <text start="1046.25" dur="3.08">said it&amp;#39;s not because of the weather</text>
  <text start="1047.51" dur="3.81">it was because people were losing jobs</text>
  <text start="1049.33" dur="4.96">the same thing is gonna happen with</text>
  <text start="1051.32" dur="4.95">corporations that&amp;#39;s next where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1054.29" dur="4.95">gonna say listen we can&amp;#39;t survive</text>
  <text start="1056.27" dur="4.74">anymore we bought back our stock we</text>
  <text start="1059.24" dur="3.09">manipulated our earnings we just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1061.01" dur="3.68">have the revenue in profit we have to</text>
  <text start="1062.33" dur="5.04">keep closing and laying off people and</text>
  <text start="1064.69" dur="4.41">when the tax receipts continually drop</text>
  <text start="1067.37" dur="4.41">even if people get part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="1069.1" dur="5.41">they&amp;#39;re gonna go from that full-time job</text>
  <text start="1071.78" dur="4.56">to one or two part-time jobs the taxes</text>
  <text start="1074.51" dur="3.54">coming into the government are much less</text>
  <text start="1076.34" dur="4.26">and those people who aren&amp;#39;t working well</text>
  <text start="1078.05" dur="5.79">the taxes are even much less than that</text>
  <text start="1080.6" dur="5.55">so we see that we&amp;#39;re headed to this</text>
  <text start="1083.84" dur="4.29">point where there&amp;#39;s nothing left here</text>
  <text start="1086.15" dur="5.4">and everything has been moved already</text>
  <text start="1088.13" dur="5.43">over to the east let&amp;#39;s move from the</text>
  <text start="1091.55" dur="3.42">west to the east and we can see that</text>
  <text start="1093.56" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re ready to bring this on line</text>
  <text start="1094.97" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re just trying to figure it out on</text>
  <text start="1097.25" dur="4.86">how they&amp;#39;re going to explain this to the</text>
  <text start="1099.83" dur="3.3">world because the central bank&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1102.11" dur="3.6">want to be blamed for all of this</text>
  <text start="1103.13" dur="4.92">because if they are blamed guess what</text>
  <text start="1105.71" dur="4.8">they can&amp;#39;t restart the system they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1108.05" dur="5.97">reset it and this is why they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1110.51" dur="6.2">pushing for this war this event they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1114.02" dur="4.5">trying to get something to happen and</text>
  <text start="1116.71" dur="4.78">actually it&amp;#39;d be better</text>
  <text start="1118.52" dur="4.74">if the system came down without a war or</text>
  <text start="1121.49" dur="3.21">an event and everyone pointed the finger</text>
  <text start="1123.26" dur="3.75">at the central bank and said you know</text>
  <text start="1124.7" dur="4.65">something we don&amp;#39;t need the central bank</text>
  <text start="1127.01" dur="5.4">there&amp;#39;s no reason for them look what</text>
  <text start="1129.35" dur="6.57">they&amp;#39;ve done to the world they destroyed</text>
  <text start="1132.41" dur="7.92">it with debt and their economic policies</text>
  <text start="1135.92" dur="8.34">it doesn&amp;#39;t work it was never meant to be</text>
  <text start="1140.33" dur="5.79">this way the people were supposed to</text>
  <text start="1144.26" dur="4.62">create their own currency with no</text>
  <text start="1146.12" dur="3.74">interest attached we weren&amp;#39;t supposed to</text>
  <text start="1148.88" dur="3.12">borrow it</text>
  <text start="1149.86" dur="6.73">everything was supposed to balance out</text>
  <text start="1152" dur="8.309">and by having government with an open</text>
