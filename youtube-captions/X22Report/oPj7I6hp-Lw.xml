  <text start="87" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s very interesting that the central</text>
  <text start="89.55" dur="4.59">bank the mainstream media the financial</text>
  <text start="91.74" dur="5.04">plummets they were all out there saying</text>
  <text start="94.14" dur="6.33">that when the interest rates are lowered</text>
  <text start="96.78" dur="6.51">the economy goes into a recession the</text>
  <text start="100.47" dur="5.579">stock market will implode now we knew</text>
  <text start="103.29" dur="6.72">this was completely the opposite of what</text>
  <text start="106.049" dur="7.11">was going to happen we knew that if the</text>
  <text start="110.01" dur="6.48">interest rates are lowered that this is</text>
  <text start="113.159" dur="7.291">not going to cause the recession the</text>
  <text start="116.49" dur="7.769">recession was caused when the Fed raised</text>
  <text start="120.45" dur="6.57">the rates in this manipulated economy</text>
  <text start="124.259" dur="7.081">and when they hit a certain point they</text>
  <text start="127.02" dur="8.88">dropped the rates really fast Trump</text>
  <text start="131.34" dur="9.11">never allowed the interest rates to get</text>
  <text start="135.9" dur="7.71">to that point this was done on purpose</text>
  <text start="140.45" dur="5.039">they stopped it before it hit the</text>
  <text start="143.61" dur="4.59">tipping point now the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="145.489" dur="4.151">they were trying to hit that tipping</text>
  <text start="148.2" dur="4.47">point the deep state the mainstream</text>
  <text start="149.64" dur="5.22">media they were all behind this Trump</text>
  <text start="152.67" dur="4.26">the Patriots they completely stomped</text>
  <text start="154.86" dur="4.8">this and what you look when you see</text>
  <text start="156.93" dur="4.739">what&amp;#39;s happening now in the economy and</text>
  <text start="159.66" dur="3.6">you look at the stock market and yes the</text>
  <text start="161.669" dur="5.251">stock market is not</text>
  <text start="163.26" dur="6.63">a gauge of the economy we mentioned this</text>
  <text start="166.92" dur="4.739">many times before but Trump is using all</text>
  <text start="169.89" dur="4.5">the weapons against the deep state that</text>
  <text start="171.659" dur="5.91">mainstream media the central bank&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="174.39" dur="6.54">using this to show that the economy is</text>
  <text start="177.569" dur="7.711">doing well because this will cement his</text>
  <text start="180.93" dur="7.529">position in the 2020 election he knows</text>
  <text start="185.28" dur="6.539">this the economy is very very important</text>
  <text start="188.459" dur="7.711">because one people have hope people feel</text>
  <text start="191.819" dur="7.861">good and they see everything up around</text>
  <text start="196.17" dur="6.409">them going the way they want they want</text>
  <text start="199.68" dur="6.33">that person to stay in the white house</text>
  <text start="202.579" dur="6.49">and it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter what else</text>
  <text start="206.01" dur="6.66">is going on because if their pensions</text>
  <text start="209.069" dur="5.25">are safe and they keep making money they</text>
  <text start="212.67" dur="5.239">didn&amp;#39;t lose their savings they still</text>
  <text start="214.319" dur="6.991">have their job or they got a better job</text>
  <text start="217.909" dur="5.5">that&amp;#39;s what they care about and if they</text>
  <text start="221.31" dur="4.349">hear that manufacturing and other jobs</text>
  <text start="223.409" dur="3.83">are coming back to this country that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="225.659" dur="5.01">what they care about</text>
  <text start="227.239" dur="5.051">so Trump he&amp;#39;s using everything the</text>
  <text start="230.669" dur="4.801">central bank the deep state has been</text>
  <text start="232.29" dur="6.36">using for years on the people and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.47" dur="5.299">turning this around and using it on the</text>
  <text start="238.65" dur="4.91">mainstream media and the central bank</text>
  <text start="240.769" dur="5.8">now the markets again reached a new high</text>
  <text start="243.56" dur="6.069">this is the one hundred and tenth</text>
  <text start="246.569" dur="5.82">all-time high since the 2016 election</text>
  <text start="249.629" dur="5.371">and a hundred and ten more all-time</text>
  <text start="252.389" dur="6.511">highs than two previous presidents</text>
  <text start="255" dur="6.65">reached in their entire first terms the</text>
  <text start="258.9" dur="5.73">economy is doing well statistically</text>
  <text start="261.65" dur="6.04">remember that this is all being done on</text>
  <text start="264.63" dur="5.219">purpose and we&amp;#39;re not talking about the</text>
  <text start="267.69" dur="4.199">underlying fundamentals of how the</text>
  <text start="269.849" dur="4.261">system&amp;#39;s falling apart this is why the</text>
  <text start="271.889" dur="3.991">mainstream media the deep state they</text>
  <text start="274.11" dur="4.25">were out there and some of the bad</text>
  <text start="275.88" dur="6.15">central bankers were out there saying</text>
  <text start="278.36" dur="6.58">yes all the indicators are pointing to a</text>
  <text start="282.03" dur="5.759">recession because they understood that</text>
  <text start="284.94" dur="6.84">the fundamentals under the illusion they</text>
  <text start="287.789" dur="5.551">are bad and what Trump is doing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="291.78" dur="3.81">doing exactly what they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="293.34" dur="2.82">for a very long time he&amp;#39;s masking them</text>
  <text start="295.59" dur="3.06">for</text>
  <text start="296.16" dur="4.2">the time being now this is not going to</text>
  <text start="298.65" dur="2.43">cure the economy it&amp;#39;s not gonna make it</text>
  <text start="300.36" dur="5.22">all better</text>
  <text start="301.08" dur="7.14">he needs the time to create the new</text>
  <text start="305.58" dur="6.39">system Paul Sperry tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="308.22" dur="6.66">following IBD TI PP economic optimism</text>
  <text start="311.97" dur="4.98">index increased to fifty two point nine</text>
  <text start="314.88" dur="5.28">the second straight monthly gain</text>
  <text start="316.95" dur="5.79">including among independent voters index</text>
  <text start="320.16" dur="4.8">has now recorded a skort in a positive</text>
  <text start="322.74" dur="5.49">territory for a record 38 consecutive</text>
  <text start="324.96" dur="7.88">months suggesting consumer spending will</text>
  <text start="328.23" dur="8.15">remain robust into near-term now</text>
  <text start="332.84" dur="7.72">consumer spending is very very important</text>
  <text start="336.38" dur="6.79">because that is about 70% of GDP and</text>
  <text start="340.56" dur="4.92">this is why Trump is continually cutting</text>
  <text start="343.17" dur="4.38">taxes that&amp;#39;s one of the reasons the</text>
  <text start="345.48" dur="4.4">other reason is because he understands</text>
  <text start="347.55" dur="5.25">when we transition into the new system</text>
  <text start="349.88" dur="4.66">most likely once they get rid of the</text>
  <text start="352.8" dur="4.08">central bank taxes are going to</text>
  <text start="354.54" dur="4.38">disappear and it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter</text>
  <text start="356.88" dur="6.36">at this point because there is no way to</text>
  <text start="358.92" dur="7.83">pay off this debt so cut taxes leave</text>
  <text start="363.24" dur="6.36">taxes it&amp;#39;s better to cut them allow the</text>
  <text start="366.75" dur="5.16">people to keep their currency right now</text>
  <text start="369.6" dur="4.83">the White House tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="371.91" dur="5.79">following under president a trail Donald</text>
  <text start="374.43" dur="7.05">Trump six point seven million jobs</text>
  <text start="377.7" dur="6.87">created historic low african-american</text>
  <text start="381.48" dur="7.89">unemployment rate historic low African</text>
  <text start="384.57" dur="7.34">American poverty rate wages up 9% 2.5</text>
  <text start="389.37" dur="5">million lifted from poverty</text>
  <text start="391.91" dur="6.27">groundbreaking criminal justice reform</text>
  <text start="394.37" dur="9.73">reinvesting in forgotten communities</text>
  <text start="398.18" dur="9.46">what is Trump doing he is preparing the</text>
  <text start="404.1" dur="6.72">new economy he&amp;#39;s preparing for the</text>
  <text start="407.64" dur="6.87">transition that&amp;#39;s what we are watching</text>
  <text start="410.82" dur="5.91">right now and how do you do this you</text>
  <text start="414.51" dur="4.47">need to rebuild the infrastructure why</text>
  <text start="416.73" dur="5.57">do you think they were just letting the</text>
  <text start="418.98" dur="7.35">entire country go down the tubes because</text>
  <text start="422.3" dur="6.34">their plan was to bring the u.s. into a</text>
  <text start="426.33" dur="3.63">third world type of nation so the</text>
  <text start="428.64" dur="5.52">infrastructure at that point</text>
  <text start="429.96" dur="7.709">really didn&amp;#39;t matter and the corrupt</text>
  <text start="434.16" dur="6.96">politicians weren&amp;#39;t going to allow these</text>
  <text start="437.669" dur="5.011">funds to rebuild America the deep state</text>
  <text start="441.12" dur="5.4">plan was completely different</text>
  <text start="442.68" dur="7.35">Trump is rebuilding the country it needs</text>
  <text start="446.52" dur="7.92">to be rebuilt and he&amp;#39;s using the central</text>
  <text start="450.03" dur="6.66">bank funds to do it why not why do you</text>
  <text start="454.44" dur="4.77">think there&amp;#39;s 2.5 million that were</text>
  <text start="456.69" dur="5.61">lifted out of poverty you can&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="459.21" dur="5.88">them dependent on the government when we</text>
  <text start="462.3" dur="4.67">move into this new economic system why</text>
  <text start="465.09" dur="5.699">do you think he&amp;#39;s reinvesting in</text>
  <text start="466.97" dur="5.74">forgotten communities because once again</text>
  <text start="470.789" dur="4.081">the infrastructure and these communities</text>
  <text start="472.71" dur="4.739">were all the manufacturers and companies</text>
  <text start="474.87" dur="4.65">have been moved out of these areas we</text>
  <text start="477.449" dur="4.111">need to reinvest in them once again we</text>
  <text start="479.52" dur="4.95">need to bring the companies back into</text>
  <text start="481.56" dur="6.06">this area we have to rebuild they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="484.47" dur="7.14">doing all of this at a very very quick</text>
  <text start="487.62" dur="6.78">pace and it has to be done now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="491.61" dur="5.549">very interesting is that Texas they just</text>
  <text start="494.4" dur="5.519">passed a bill where there&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="497.159" dur="5.04">be any state income tax we also</text>
  <text start="499.919" dur="4.021">understand that gold is going to be used</text>
  <text start="502.199" dur="4.5">as sound money they have a gold</text>
  <text start="503.94" dur="6.63">repository and the Dallas Federal</text>
  <text start="506.699" dur="8.03">Reserve Bank Rob Kaplan he has concerns</text>
  <text start="510.57" dur="7.17">about how Texas is using low taxes</text>
  <text start="514.729" dur="5.98">limited regulation to attract new</text>
  <text start="517.74" dur="6.419">business because this is everything for</text>
  <text start="520.709" dur="5.221">central bank does not like what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="524.159" dur="5.131">really saying is we don&amp;#39;t like the</text>
  <text start="525.93" dur="6">direction Texas is taken right now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="529.29" dur="5.7">not what the central bank wants and if</text>
  <text start="531.93" dur="5.96">other states get wind of this well</text>
  <text start="534.99" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re gonna follow in Texas footsteps</text>
  <text start="537.89" dur="6.31">why do you think there&amp;#39;s a central bank</text>
  <text start="540.57" dur="5.43">in almost every single state why do you</text>
  <text start="544.2" dur="3.06">think there&amp;#39;s a central bank and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="546" dur="4.8">talking about a private western central</text>
  <text start="547.26" dur="7.79">bike in every single country to maintain</text>
  <text start="550.8" dur="8.17">control that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="555.05" dur="7.74">and these central banks they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="558.97" dur="6.34">when you have no income tax they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="562.79" dur="5.22">like it when there&amp;#39;s hardly any</text>
  <text start="565.31" dur="7.68">regulations they don&amp;#39;t like it when you</text>
  <text start="568.01" dur="8.13">don&amp;#39;t follow their methodology because</text>
  <text start="572.99" dur="5.76">when you start breaking away from what</text>
  <text start="576.14" dur="5.31">the central bank is doing you start to</text>
  <text start="578.75" dur="3.99">see people prosper you start to see</text>
  <text start="581.45" dur="4.41">communities prosper</text>
  <text start="582.74" dur="5.4">you start to see countries prosper they</text>
  <text start="585.86" dur="5.969">don&amp;#39;t like this this is why they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="588.14" dur="5.699">worried about the UK this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="591.829" dur="6.781">worrying about other countries within</text>
  <text start="593.839" dur="8.19">the EU because once these countries</text>
  <text start="598.61" dur="6.06">break away and they find out wow it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="602.029" dur="5.43">much better off without a central bank</text>
  <text start="604.67" dur="4.979">controlling us other countries want to</text>
  <text start="607.459" dur="4.791">follow this is why the central banks</text>
  <text start="609.649" dur="5.791">have to keep such a tight rein and</text>
  <text start="612.25" dur="7.39">control everything they never want a</text>
  <text start="615.44" dur="7.139">country to implode on itself because of</text>
  <text start="619.64" dur="6.689">debt because that would expose the</text>
  <text start="622.579" dur="6.57">central bank they always keep them at</text>
  <text start="626.329" dur="6.51">that stage where they really can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="629.149" dur="8.161">ahead but they don&amp;#39;t implode where they</text>
  <text start="632.839" dur="6.511">have to push austerity rules make it</text>
  <text start="637.31" dur="3.75">tougher for the people so they can take</text>
  <text start="639.35" dur="6.03">on more debt but they always make sure</text>
  <text start="641.06" dur="6.71">that there&amp;#39;s a balance and they make</text>
  <text start="645.38" dur="4.949">sure that the country doesn&amp;#39;t default</text>
  <text start="647.77" dur="6.189">because this would reflect on the</text>
  <text start="650.329" dur="6.031">central bank they&amp;#39;ve done this for a</text>
  <text start="653.959" dur="7.291">very long time and it&amp;#39;s been done on</text>
  <text start="656.36" dur="7.32">purpose now it&amp;#39;s time to break what the</text>
  <text start="661.25" dur="4.41">central bank has been doing and I do</text>
  <text start="663.68" dur="4.43">believe this is why China and this was</text>
  <text start="665.66" dur="3.63">not a coincidence even though there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="668.11" dur="3.159">Navarro</text>
  <text start="669.29" dur="5.01">out there saying listen Trump is the</text>
  <text start="671.269" dur="5.401">only one that can remove tariffs China</text>
  <text start="674.3" dur="4.62">is just putting that this information</text>
  <text start="676.67" dur="5.55">and it&amp;#39;s fake news really if you look at</text>
  <text start="678.92" dur="5.97">the translation it&amp;#39;s not that China is</text>
  <text start="682.22" dur="4.38">going to remove these tariffs what</text>
  <text start="684.89" dur="4.759">they&amp;#39;re saying is every time a deal is</text>
  <text start="686.6" dur="9.419">going to be made that</text>
  <text start="689.649" dur="9.43">Trump China they will agree to phase out</text>
  <text start="696.019" dur="5.581">the tariffs now they put this message</text>
  <text start="699.079" dur="5.04">out there and optics are very important</text>
  <text start="701.6" dur="5.37">because they want the central bank to</text>
  <text start="704.119" dur="3.78">understand and know that this is where</text>
  <text start="706.97" dur="3.929">they are headed</text>
  <text start="707.899" dur="4.83">now Trump on the other hand is saying</text>
  <text start="710.899" dur="4.86">that hey we&amp;#39;re not letting up on tariffs</text>
  <text start="712.729" dur="5.91">right now so the central bank there in</text>
  <text start="715.759" dur="4.2">like limbo right now they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="718.639" dur="3.331">which way to go there&amp;#39;s a little bit of</text>
