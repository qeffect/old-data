  <text start="287.039" dur="3.201">to come out</text>
  <text start="288.139" dur="5.911">and it&amp;#39;s going to show there was treason</text>
  <text start="290.24" dur="5.639">there was spying and they just didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="294.05" dur="4.979">this to Trump remember they were also</text>
  <text start="295.879" dur="4.801">spying on judges they were spying on Ted</text>
  <text start="299.029" dur="3.961">Cruz and many others and this had</text>
  <text start="300.68" dur="3.78">nothing to do with Russian collusion so</text>
  <text start="302.99" dur="4.35">how are they going to explain this wait</text>
  <text start="304.46" dur="4.829">and guess what do you really think they</text>
  <text start="307.34" dur="5.549">had FISA warrants for all these other</text>
  <text start="309.289" dur="6.771">people know they got the FISA warrants</text>
  <text start="312.889" dur="6">because Trump was coming into office</text>
  <text start="316.06" dur="5.949">they were trying to cover up everything</text>
  <text start="318.889" dur="6.33">that they were doing but guess what they</text>
  <text start="322.009" dur="4.71">found while they were in office and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="325.219" dur="3">talking about trumping the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="326.719" dur="5.94">found that they were spying on many many</text>
  <text start="328.219" dur="6.931">many more people without warrants think</text>
  <text start="332.659" dur="6">about this for a second now while all</text>
  <text start="335.15" dur="6.329">this is going on Trump and the Patriots</text>
  <text start="338.659" dur="6.57">they like the mainstream media to go off</text>
  <text start="341.479" dur="6.93">on different issues and they like to</text>
  <text start="345.229" dur="5.37">keep them arguing about it and I noticed</text>
  <text start="348.409" dur="5.01">this with like stormy Daniels armor OSA</text>
