  <text start="66.34" dur="6">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="68.53" dur="7.4">news now ADP came out with their numbers</text>
  <text start="72.34" dur="6">today and we know that these numbers are</text>
  <text start="75.93" dur="5.2">manipulated we know the government</text>
  <text start="78.34" dur="4.83">numbers are manipulated and what is</text>
  <text start="81.13" dur="5.04">happening right now is that these</text>
  <text start="83.17" dur="5.759">numbers well they can&amp;#39;t keep the</text>
  <text start="86.17" dur="6.149">manipulation up there is too many people</text>
  <text start="88.929" dur="6.451">losing their jobs and we know last month</text>
  <text start="92.319" dur="6.09">ATP had a disappointing drop in</text>
  <text start="95.38" dur="6.09">employment and we can see right now in</text>
  <text start="98.409" dur="5.25">October and guess what it&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="101.47" dur="5.13">once again actually if you look at the</text>
  <text start="103.659" dur="6.081">trend we see that it is trending down</text>
  <text start="106.6" dur="6.54">and what we&amp;#39;re looking at right now is</text>
  <text start="109.74" dur="5.29">that jobs are being removed from the</text>
  <text start="113.14" dur="6.54">economy people are being laid off and</text>
  <text start="115.03" dur="6.81">the gains that we&amp;#39;ve seen have</text>
  <text start="119.68" dur="4.17">completely disappeared now those were</text>
  <text start="121.84" dur="4.5">manipulated gains but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="123.85" dur="4.71">right now is that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="126.34" dur="5.459">deteriorating when we look at the feds</text>
  <text start="128.56" dur="7.519">own labor market indicator well it is</text>
  <text start="131.799" dur="7.921">now in contraction year-over-year and</text>
  <text start="136.079" dur="6.041">when we look back in time this is an</text>
  <text start="139.72" dur="5.54">indicator letting us know that we are</text>
  <text start="142.12" dur="5.28">heading into an economic crisis and</text>
  <text start="145.26" dur="4.27">that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re heading if we look at</text>
  <text start="147.4" dur="4.32">the real estate market we see that US</text>
  <text start="149.53" dur="4.739">mortgage applications activity they have</text>
  <text start="151.72" dur="4.799">fallen to five-month low as remember</text>
  <text start="154.269" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us that the</text>
  <text start="156.519" dur="4.411">real estate market is doing fine how can</text>
  <text start="158.829" dur="3.831">it be doing fine if the American people</text>
  <text start="160.93" dur="6.74">are sitting on the sidelines and</text>
  <text start="162.66" dur="5.01">applications are continually declining</text>
  <text start="167.73" dur="5.379">that must mean that there&amp;#39;s foreign</text>
  <text start="170.56" dur="6">buyers hedge fund investors but guess</text>
  <text start="173.109" dur="5.581">what they cannot keep the real estate</text>
  <text start="176.56" dur="3.63">market going they can do it in a couple</text>
  <text start="178.69" dur="1.71">cities maybe the 20 cities that they</text>
  <text start="180.19" dur="3.48">have</text>
  <text start="180.4" dur="5.49">have outlined with case-shiller where</text>
  <text start="183.67" dur="5.31">they report on how great it is but the</text>
  <text start="185.89" dur="5.97">rest of the country guess what the</text>
  <text start="188.98" dur="5.25">people are not in the market the people</text>
  <text start="191.86" dur="4.62">don&amp;#39;t have the funds the people are</text>
  <text start="194.23" dur="6.45">being laid off and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="196.48" dur="8.009">the situation is not improving it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="200.68" dur="5.639">actually getting worse and we can see</text>
  <text start="204.489" dur="3.991">there&amp;#39;s seven different economic</text>
  <text start="206.319" dur="4.111">indicators and we went through many</text>
  <text start="208.48" dur="4.319">different economic indicators but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="210.43" dur="7.8">starting to see that there are so many</text>
  <text start="212.799" dur="9.36">now that are even even to 2008 or worse</text>
  <text start="218.23" dur="6.089">off than two thousand eight and when we</text>
  <text start="222.159" dur="6.061">look at a leading indicator which is</text>
  <text start="224.319" dur="7.92">investment well that is contracting over</text>
  <text start="228.22" dur="6.84">the last 65 years you can see the steady</text>
  <text start="232.239" dur="5.071">decline in terms of investment as the</text>
  <text start="235.06" dur="7.5">u.s. slowly began investing less into</text>
  <text start="237.31" dur="8.88">the economy with each economic cycle now</text>
  <text start="242.56" dur="7.019">with each downturn an investment</text>
  <text start="246.19" dur="7.109">relative to GDP it is a perfect leading</text>
  <text start="249.579" dur="7.171">indicator letting us know that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="253.299" dur="5.701">is in a recession corporate America is</text>
  <text start="256.75" dur="6.539">cutting back they&amp;#39;re not spending and</text>
  <text start="259" dur="8.699">with each one we can see that the</text>
  <text start="263.289" dur="7.44">economy is contracting the economy is</text>
  <text start="267.699" dur="5.541">getting worse the economy&amp;#39;s declining we</text>
  <text start="270.729" dur="5.37">have entered a recession right now and</text>
  <text start="273.24" dur="7.799">from this indicator and we go back in</text>
  <text start="276.099" dur="9">time every time we&amp;#39;ve seen investment in</text>
  <text start="281.039" dur="9.88">the US economy decline we entered a</text>
  <text start="285.099" dur="7.921">recession if we go back to 2007-2008 we</text>
  <text start="290.919" dur="3.901">saw it at that point in time if you go</text>
  <text start="293.02" dur="4.74">back to two thousand to two thousand one</text>
  <text start="294.82" dur="6.3">we saw it at that point in time if you</text>
  <text start="297.76" dur="7.32">go back all the way back to the 50s</text>
  <text start="301.12" dur="7.47">we&amp;#39;ve seen it every single time this is</text>
  <text start="305.08" dur="6.72">an indicator letting us know that we are</text>
  <text start="308.59" dur="5.22">in a recession we talked about the Fed</text>
  <text start="311.8" dur="5.46">labor market</text>
  <text start="313.81" dur="9.15">guess what every time the Fed labor</text>
  <text start="317.26" dur="11.31">market drops below zero we enter a</text>
  <text start="322.96" dur="9.27">recession or a depression now in 1977 it</text>
  <text start="328.57" dur="16.17">went below zero we had a recession 1982</text>
  <text start="332.23" dur="17.88">same thing 1987 1992 1997 2002 2007 2016</text>
  <text start="344.74" dur="12.09">we are below zero another indicator we</text>
  <text start="350.11" dur="10.71">are in a recession we see consecutive</text>
  <text start="356.83" dur="7.14">quarters of declining earnings well this</text>
  <text start="360.82" dur="5.75">is another indicator presently the US</text>
  <text start="363.97" dur="6.419">has had five consecutive quarters of</text>
  <text start="366.57" dur="5.47">corporate profits falling the current</text>
  <text start="370.389" dur="4.471">quarter profit season is still in</text>
  <text start="372.04" dur="5.04">progress right now but big odds are very</text>
  <text start="374.86" dur="5.76">high that it&amp;#39;s going to make it number</text>
  <text start="377.08" dur="6.51">six right now and every time going back</text>
  <text start="380.62" dur="8.31">in time where we saw this happen we</text>
  <text start="383.59" dur="10.44">entered a recession we are seeing this</text>
  <text start="388.93" dur="7.77">in every single indicator when we look</text>
  <text start="394.03" dur="5.07">at capital goods spending well this is</text>
  <text start="396.7" dur="5.66">basically declining nearly every quarter</text>
  <text start="399.1" dur="5.28">since 2014 if the economy was strong</text>
  <text start="402.36" dur="3.64">companies would be investing in more</text>
  <text start="404.38" dur="3.87">capital goods to grow production and</text>
  <text start="406" dur="5.84">revenue well the opposite is happening</text>
  <text start="408.25" dur="6.57">right now and companies are cutting back</text>
  <text start="411.84" dur="6.57">and why are they doing this well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="414.82" dur="6.48">countering weak demand so we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="418.41" dur="5.229">another indicator letting us know we are</text>
  <text start="421.3" dur="7.16">in a recession business conditions</text>
  <text start="423.639" dur="9.181">looking ahead is declining we r equal to</text>
  <text start="428.46" dur="7.14">where we were back in 2014 approaching</text>
  <text start="432.82" dur="5.4">where we were back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="435.6" dur="7.059">they&amp;#39;re already predicting a poor</text>
  <text start="438.22" dur="6.66">Christmas sale forecast letting letting</text>
  <text start="442.659" dur="4.721">us know that this Christmas is not going</text>
  <text start="444.88" dur="4.27">to be very good</text>
  <text start="447.38" dur="5.16">the corporate media is going to try to</text>
  <text start="449.15" dur="5.73">make you convinced that the Christmas</text>
  <text start="452.54" dur="4.65">season is crazy they&amp;#39;re going to show</text>
  <text start="454.88" dur="4.5">one or two videos of people running to</text>
  <text start="457.19" dur="4.35">the stores during black friday they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="459.38" dur="4.32">going to tell you cyber monday how many</text>
  <text start="461.54" dur="3.63">people are searching online searching</text>
  <text start="463.7" dur="4.35">online doesn&amp;#39;t mean buying by the way</text>
  <text start="465.17" dur="5.79">and they&amp;#39;re going to tell you that wow</text>
  <text start="468.05" dur="6.93">this is incredible but when the numbers</text>
  <text start="470.96" dur="6">come out later guess what you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="474.98" dur="5.04">going to see it you&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="476.96" dur="7.11">stores close last time we saw stores</text>
  <text start="480.02" dur="6">closing during the holiday season now</text>
  <text start="484.07" dur="3.84">what store closes during the holiday</text>
  <text start="486.02" dur="5.85">season because this is the time of the</text>
  <text start="487.91" dur="8.16">year that they wait for most likely we</text>
  <text start="491.87" dur="6.24">will see this happen once again we see</text>
  <text start="496.07" dur="10.41">the delinquency rate on company loans</text>
  <text start="498.11" dur="11.37">made by banks well it&amp;#39;s increasing the</text>
  <text start="506.48" dur="5.61">last two recessions the US had in 2001</text>
  <text start="509.48" dur="5.01">and 2008 both showed delinquency rates</text>
  <text start="512.09" dur="5.49">spiking before each recession occurred</text>
  <text start="514.49" dur="5.76">guess what just happened we spite from</text>
  <text start="517.58" dur="6.02">one percent to one-point-six percent and</text>
  <text start="520.25" dur="8.64">this is when interest rates are at zero</text>
  <text start="523.6" dur="11.26">percent we are in a recession there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="528.89" dur="6.9">way else to look at this of course we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="534.86" dur="2.04">not going to hear this from the</text>
  <text start="535.79" dur="2.16">government we&amp;#39;re not going to hear this</text>
  <text start="536.9" dur="3.03">from the Fed we&amp;#39;re not going to hear</text>
  <text start="537.95" dur="3.57">this from the corporate media because</text>
  <text start="539.93" dur="3.6">well they tell us about is the stock</text>
  <text start="541.52" dur="5.37">market and unemployment the numbers they</text>
  <text start="543.53" dur="6.81">can manipulate but all of these economic</text>
  <text start="546.89" dur="6.69">indicators already point to a recession</text>
  <text start="550.34" dur="8.34">now if we go back in time and we go back</text>
  <text start="553.58" dur="8.58">to 2007 prior to 2007 2006 let&amp;#39;s say and</text>
  <text start="558.68" dur="9.93">we look at these same indicators guess</text>
  <text start="562.16" dur="9.45">what we see the same exact story now</text>
  <text start="568.61" dur="5.58">during that time they were telling us</text>
  <text start="571.61" dur="6.24">that everything was fine everything was</text>
  <text start="574.19" dur="5.52">contained everything is improving don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="577.85" dur="3.27">worry about it the stock market was</text>
  <text start="579.71" dur="3.87">hitting all-time highs</text>
  <text start="581.12" dur="4.5">back then what was the market 14,000</text>
  <text start="583.58" dur="3.84">points but when we look at these same</text>
  <text start="585.62" dur="5.03">exact indicators that are flashing red</text>
  <text start="587.42" dur="6.84">right now they were the same back then</text>
  <text start="590.65" dur="5.77">flashing red if you are looking you</text>
  <text start="594.26" dur="4.829">would have seen it but many people</text>
  <text start="596.42" dur="7.02">weren&amp;#39;t looking they were listening to</text>
  <text start="599.089" dur="7.681">the government the central bank so from</text>
  <text start="603.44" dur="5.91">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been seeing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="606.77" dur="6.99">in a recession actually teetering on a</text>
  <text start="609.35" dur="6.72">depression at this point and we can see</text>
  <text start="613.76" dur="5.579">that we are very close to an economic</text>
  <text start="616.07" dur="5.01">crisis now remember these are economic</text>
  <text start="619.339" dur="4.111">indicators we don&amp;#39;t have a crystal ball</text>
  <text start="621.08" dur="4.199">we&amp;#39;re not looking into the future making</text>
  <text start="623.45" dur="3.99">predictions here we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="625.279" dur="4.261">history we&amp;#39;re looking at economic</text>
  <text start="627.44" dur="4.649">indicators we&amp;#39;re putting the pieces</text>
  <text start="629.54" dur="4.32">together to say okay I understand what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="632.089" dur="4.291">going on here because we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="633.86" dur="5.55">same thing happen once again and what</text>
  <text start="636.38" dur="6.36">history repeats very rarely do you have</text>
  <text start="639.41" dur="4.77">a different outcome I mean they can spin</text>
  <text start="642.74" dur="4.5">the manipulated numbers any way they</text>
  <text start="644.18" dur="5.13">want but the outcome most likely is</text>
  <text start="647.24" dur="5.64">going to be the same or much worse and</text>
  <text start="649.31" dur="9.99">remember nothing has really improved at</text>
  <text start="652.88" dur="8.43">all during this period actually when you</text>
  <text start="659.3" dur="6.09">look at all these economic indicators</text>
  <text start="661.31" dur="6.75">things have gotten much worse people</text>
  <text start="665.39" dur="5.31">have adjusted to the new system where</text>
  <text start="668.06" dur="4.49">maybe at one time they had a full-time</text>
  <text start="670.7" dur="4.44">job and now they have two part-time jobs</text>
  <text start="672.55" dur="4.81">they&amp;#39;re just making it by they got rid</text>
  <text start="675.14" dur="4.08">of their expenses they moved out of</text>
  <text start="677.36" dur="5.28">their expensive house may be moved into</text>
  <text start="679.22" dur="5.22">an apartment but it doesn&amp;#39;t mean things</text>
  <text start="682.64" dur="4.71">have gotten better it means that the</text>
  <text start="684.44" dur="7.68">people had to adjust to a different</text>
  <text start="687.35" dur="8.01">reality and most of the people</text>
  <text start="692.12" dur="5.73">downgraded most of the people said you</text>
  <text start="695.36" dur="4.979">know something I can&amp;#39;t afford that I got</text>
  <text start="697.85" dur="7.05">rid of the expensive car maybe I only</text>
  <text start="700.339" dur="7.081">have one car because I don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="704.9" dur="5.25">same income coming in and all we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="707.42" dur="5.73">seeing right now is an adjustment during</text>
  <text start="710.15" dur="5.01">these eight years more and more people</text>
  <text start="713.15" dur="4.439">had to make the adjustment</text>
  <text start="715.16" dur="3.929">there was no way around this and those</text>
  <text start="717.589" dur="2.761">people who were being laid off those</text>
  <text start="719.089" dur="4.381">people who are looking for new jobs</text>
  <text start="720.35" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re starting to realize that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="723.47" dur="6.84">a problem out there and there is a</text>
  <text start="726.86" dur="5.519">problem the economy is not doing what</text>
  <text start="730.31" dur="4.05">the central bank&amp;#39;s what the US</text>
  <text start="732.379" dur="4.44">government is telling us they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="734.36" dur="4.44">even Deutsche Bank Deutsche Bank we know</text>
  <text start="736.819" dur="5.37">is in trouble we know they&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="738.8" dur="5.55">band-aid fixes on deutsche bank we know</text>
  <text start="742.189" dur="3.9">that eventually deutsche bank is going</text>

  <text start="748.04" dur="5.609">banks and I&amp;#39;ll be a domino effect going</text>
  <text start="751.37" dur="6.959">all across Europe into the United States</text>
  <text start="753.649" dur="7.081">I mean we saw this with Lehman we saw</text>
  <text start="758.329" dur="3.781">this with the bailouts where they had to</text>
  <text start="760.73" dur="3.24">save each one of these financial</text>
  <text start="762.11" dur="3.69">institutions think about it if they</text>
  <text start="763.97" dur="4.409">didn&amp;#39;t do that it would have been a</text>
  <text start="765.8" dur="5.07">domino effect and each one would have</text>
  <text start="768.379" dur="7.221">went bye-bye we wouldn&amp;#39;t have seen them</text>
