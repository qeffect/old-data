  <text start="121.079" dur="5.28">bank system we need to remember one</text>
  <text start="123.42" dur="5.1">thing that&amp;#39;s very important the American</text>
  <text start="126.359" dur="7.291">people and not just the American people</text>
  <text start="128.52" dur="7.94">the world has never seen a central bank</text>
  <text start="133.65" dur="6.63">system implode on itself</text>
  <text start="136.46" dur="7.24">why because normally they would have an</text>
  <text start="140.28" dur="5.88">event which would cover it up no one</text>
  <text start="143.7" dur="5.67">would really notice that it was the</text>
  <text start="146.16" dur="5.01">central bank the problem that the</text>
  <text start="149.37" dur="4.86">central banks are having right now is</text>
  <text start="151.17" dur="6.649">that they don&amp;#39;t have that event they</text>
  <text start="154.23" dur="6.149">wanted they are completely exposed and</text>
  <text start="157.819" dur="5.23">they know it and if you really listen to</text>
  <text start="160.379" dur="4.501">what the IMF is saying what the other</text>
  <text start="163.049" dur="4.171">central banks are saying</text>
  <text start="164.88" dur="7.65">they&amp;#39;re scrambling to figure out a way</text>
  <text start="167.22" dur="9.12">on how to explain why the world why the</text>
  <text start="172.53" dur="6.08">growth is slowing why everything is</text>
  <text start="176.34" dur="5.39">deteriorating why everything is</text>
  <text start="178.61" dur="7.48">imploding and why we&amp;#39;re approaching</text>
  <text start="181.73" dur="7.24">another crisis because remember during</text>
  <text start="186.09" dur="6.36">the period from 2008 all the way up to</text>
  <text start="188.97" dur="7.08">2016 they told us everything was great</text>
  <text start="192.45" dur="4.98">and actually going from 2008 to 2016 and</text>
  <text start="196.05" dur="4.98">we reported on this many many times</text>
  <text start="197.43" dur="6.09">before they told us that this is a slow</text>
  <text start="201.03" dur="5.7">recovery the economy&amp;#39;s getting better</text>
  <text start="203.52" dur="6.72">this is what it looks like and now all</text>
  <text start="206.73" dur="5.76">of a sudden the economy is no longer</text>
  <text start="210.24" dur="4.77">getting better it&amp;#39;s not recovering</text>
  <text start="212.49" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re talking about crisis because</text>
  <text start="215.01" dur="4.44">they knew that their system would only</text>
  <text start="217.77" dur="4.92">last for a certain period of time and</text>
  <text start="219.45" dur="6.03">they were hoping for an event now the</text>
  <text start="222.69" dur="6.78">world gets to see what it looks like</text>
  <text start="225.48" dur="7.74">when the central bank system implodes on</text>
  <text start="229.47" dur="7.38">itself this is their worst nightmare</text>
  <text start="233.22" dur="8.7">coming true and it&amp;#39;s happening in real</text>
  <text start="236.85" dur="7.59">time this is why you see retail this is</text>
  <text start="241.92" dur="4.74">why you see housing this is why you see</text>
  <text start="244.44" dur="3.93">the debt problems this is why you see</text>
  <text start="246.66" dur="5.31">the central bankers out there trying to</text>
  <text start="248.37" dur="7.47">explain away how they can maybe</text>
  <text start="251.97" dur="6.99">manipulate this and make it better it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="255.84" dur="5.67">not going to work as we can see which we</text>
  <text start="258.96" dur="4.5">reported on Friday the IMF was already</text>
  <text start="261.51" dur="4.47">out there saying that you know the next</text>
  <text start="263.46" dur="6.87">crisis the Fed might not be able to help</text>
  <text start="265.98" dur="7.17">because of political rage what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="270.33" dur="6.24">really saying is that they&amp;#39;ve lost</text>
  <text start="273.15" dur="5.49">control the Patriots are in control and</text>
  <text start="276.57" dur="6.12">they don&amp;#39;t think the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="278.64" dur="6.12">which is the dollar reserve system which</text>
  <text start="282.69" dur="3.54">is around the world they don&amp;#39;t think the</text>
  <text start="284.76" dur="4.71">central bank here in the United States</text>
  <text start="286.23" dur="6.29">is going to be able to maneuver and</text>
  <text start="289.47" dur="5.37">manipulate the economy anymore by</text>
  <text start="292.52" dur="5">transferring funds to many different</text>
  <text start="294.84" dur="4.539">central banks this is a</text>
  <text start="297.52" dur="3.989">complete nightmare for themselves so</text>
  <text start="299.379" dur="5.901">what do we see happening around the</text>
  <text start="301.509" dur="6.12">world well out in the UK we can see that</text>
  <text start="305.28" dur="5.52">brick-and-mortar retail not just</text>
  <text start="307.629" dur="8.22">brick-and-mortar but online retail and</text>
  <text start="310.8" dur="7.75">combined together is not working it is</text>
  <text start="315.849" dur="5.19">declining actually this is the worst</text>
  <text start="318.55" dur="5.579">December and sales performance in the</text>
  <text start="321.039" dur="5.041">last ten years in the UK and when you</text>
  <text start="324.129" dur="3.54">look at it everyone says well everything</text>
  <text start="326.08" dur="3.299">is transferring from brick-and-mortar to</text>
  <text start="327.669" dur="6.15">online sales actually it&amp;#39;s not happening</text>
  <text start="329.379" dur="7.951">at all actually out in the UK only 20%</text>
  <text start="333.819" dur="6.75">of total retail sales are online the</text>
  <text start="337.33" dur="4.89">rest are not and this is not because of</text>
  <text start="340.569" dur="4.53">the brexit because we see this happening</text>
  <text start="342.22" dur="5.46">in many many other countries what is</text>
  <text start="345.099" dur="6.301">happening right now is we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="347.68" dur="4.889">entire system implode on itself and they</text>
  <text start="351.4" dur="3.72">can&amp;#39;t cover it up</text>
  <text start="352.569" dur="4.771">I remember going way way back in the</text>
  <text start="355.12" dur="4.259">beginning not in the beginning of time</text>
  <text start="357.34" dur="5.669">but back to 2008 when we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="359.379" dur="5.28">through this recovery anytime something</text>
  <text start="363.009" dur="4.88">didn&amp;#39;t go the way they wanted and they</text>
  <text start="364.659" dur="6.151">blame retail back then on weather and</text>
  <text start="367.889" dur="4.391">then when it was sunny out they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="370.81" dur="4.079">blame it on weather so then they started</text>
  <text start="372.28" dur="4.229">to blame it on online sales and then</text>
  <text start="374.889" dur="3.81">when you looked at the online sales and</text>
  <text start="376.509" dur="4.59">brick-and-mortar combined and sales were</text>
  <text start="378.699" dur="5.731">still weak they couldn&amp;#39;t figure out what</text>
  <text start="381.099" dur="7.761">else to do this is what it looks like</text>
  <text start="384.43" dur="8.849">when when a central bank system is</text>
  <text start="388.86" dur="7.39">imploding on itself and the mainstream</text>
  <text start="393.279" dur="5.13">media the central bank the deep state</text>
  <text start="396.25" dur="4.169">they&amp;#39;re having a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="398.409" dur="5.85">explaining away why all of this is</text>
  <text start="400.419" dur="7.59">happening now we know the plan is to</text>
  <text start="404.259" dur="6.63">bring down the system and expose it all</text>
  <text start="408.009" dur="4.741">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="410.889" dur="2.701">the central banks are being exposed all</text>
  <text start="412.75" dur="3.169">on their own</text>
  <text start="413.59" dur="4.949">and of course this is part of their plan</text>
  <text start="415.919" dur="3.521">now during the shutdown which is very</text>
  <text start="418.539" dur="2.88">interesting there many different</text>
  <text start="419.44" dur="7.8">agencies that were shut down one of them</text>
  <text start="421.419" dur="8.881">was the IRS and the IRS they are saying</text>
  <text start="427.24" dur="4.13">that because of the shutdown they are</text>
  <text start="430.3" dur="3.95">buried in</text>
  <text start="431.37" dur="5.579">of unanswered taxpayer letters there are</text>
  <text start="434.25" dur="4.53">weeks behind schedule on training for</text>
  <text start="436.949" dur="3.601">workers and their needing to hire</text>
  <text start="438.78" dur="4.889">thousands of new employees for this tax</text>
  <text start="440.55" dur="8.25">filing season and it might take months</text>
  <text start="443.669" dur="8.791">or a year to recover from this now you</text>
  <text start="448.8" dur="5.25">need to think was this part of the plane</text>
  <text start="452.46" dur="3.06">because we know if we&amp;#39;re gonna bring</text>
  <text start="454.05" dur="4.619">down the central bank we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="455.52" dur="6.63">bringing down the IRS and when you look</text>
  <text start="458.669" dur="7.051">at this you can see that this is going</text>
  <text start="462.15" dur="5.489">to be a problem now we know there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="465.72" dur="5.43">bills that are floating in the house</text>
  <text start="467.639" dur="6.571">HR 24 and 25 one by Thomas Massie which</text>
  <text start="471.15" dur="6.66">is going which says ordered the Fed the</text>
  <text start="474.21" dur="6.079">other one is abolish the IRS and we know</text>
  <text start="477.81" dur="5.49">to bring down this system we need to</text>
  <text start="480.289" dur="7.451">bring down all of it we just can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="483.3" dur="8.46">one or the other and we understand that</text>
  <text start="487.74" dur="6.209">to expose the deep state you need to</text>
  <text start="491.76" dur="6.87">have an event you need to show the</text>
  <text start="493.949" dur="7.801">people why they are responsible and we</text>
  <text start="498.63" dur="4.44">know that the deep state they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="501.75" dur="2.34">this to happen we know the central</text>
  <text start="503.07" dur="2.64">bankers and I&amp;#39;m talking about the Ross</text>
  <text start="504.09" dur="4.98">trials I&amp;#39;m talking everything above the</text>
  <text start="505.71" dur="5.67">fed everything above Powell they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="509.07" dur="3.42">want this to happen this is why the IMF</text>
  <text start="511.38" dur="3.659">is out there frantically trying to</text>
  <text start="512.49" dur="6.929">figure out what they can do to solve</text>
  <text start="515.039" dur="7.411">this problem but it looks like from what</text>
  <text start="519.419" dur="5.67">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="522.45" dur="5.19">in control of the central bank here in</text>
  <text start="525.089" dur="4.351">the United States Trump has been</text>
  <text start="527.64" dur="3.44">tweeting out and contradicting the Fed</text>
  <text start="529.44" dur="4.53">for quite a while</text>
  <text start="531.08" dur="7.33">telling the Fed what to do when to do it</text>
  <text start="533.97" dur="9.18">and we know from cue and we&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="538.41" dur="7.74">back to post 2575 q is told us that they</text>
  <text start="543.15" dur="4.26">understand the plan they understand the</text>
  <text start="546.15" dur="4.5">deep state their plan has always been</text>
  <text start="547.41" dur="6.21">for the Fed to raise rates raise them</text>
  <text start="550.65" dur="5.67">quickly which they started to do during</text>
  <text start="553.62" dur="4.8">the 2016 election and as soon as Trump</text>
  <text start="556.32" dur="4.41">came into office they really raised the</text>
  <text start="558.42" dur="4.06">rates until Powell was put into place</text>
  <text start="560.73" dur="3.52">and Yellen was out</text>
  <text start="562.48" dur="3.69">then hey everything started to change a</text>
  <text start="564.25" dur="4.769">little bit and what do we see happening</text>
  <text start="566.17" dur="5.46">well during the first year of Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="569.019" dur="4.68">presidency they were still saying that</text>
  <text start="571.63" dur="2.97">this was Obama&amp;#39;s economy he recovered it</text>
  <text start="573.699" dur="3.241">it looked great</text>
  <text start="574.6" dur="4.919">Trump came in and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="576.94" dur="4.17">started getting with TPP renegotiating</text>
  <text start="579.519" dur="3.901">NAFTA getting rid of all the globalist</text>
  <text start="581.11" dur="5.339">trade deals then to start and he started</text>
  <text start="583.42" dur="4.44">to implement tariffs and this is when</text>
  <text start="586.449" dur="3.031">they started to push the idea that</text>
  <text start="587.86" dur="4.849">tariffs were going to bring down the</text>
  <text start="589.48" dur="5.87">economy what do we see happening today</text>
  <text start="592.709" dur="4.93">well this is very interesting because</text>
  <text start="595.35" dur="5.08">the central banks are starting to</text>
  <text start="597.639" dur="3.961">realize they are no longer in control of</text>
  <text start="600.43" dur="2.849">the Fed and remember there&amp;#39;s different</text>
  <text start="601.6" dur="4.62">central banks around the world the ECB</text>
  <text start="603.279" dur="5.31">we have the IMF we have the biz we have</text>
  <text start="606.22" dur="5.4">the Federal Reserve so what has happened</text>
  <text start="608.589" dur="4.021">since Trump came into office well the</text>
  <text start="611.62" dur="3.779">globalists plans</text>
  <text start="612.61" dur="4.89">he&amp;#39;s unwinding them and he&amp;#39;s putting</text>
  <text start="615.399" dur="5.071">together bilateral trade agreements and</text>
  <text start="617.5" dur="5.37">getting rid of all the globalist deals</text>
  <text start="620.47" dur="5.27">that they put together he&amp;#39;s also taken</text>
  <text start="622.87" dur="5.899">control of the central bank with Powell</text>
  <text start="625.74" dur="6.579">Q has told us they know the plan for</text>
  <text start="628.769" dur="7.26">2020 what they were trying to do so</text>
  <text start="632.319" dur="7.801">right now we see the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="636.029" dur="6.79">scaling back the interest rates we see</text>
  <text start="640.12" dur="6.449">Washington is backing off tariffs and</text>
  <text start="642.819" dur="10.051">trade war rhetoric we see that</text>
  <text start="646.569" dur="9.991">everything is being reversed why because</text>
  <text start="652.87" dur="9.36">Hugh has told us they understand what</text>
  <text start="656.56" dur="7.32">the deep state plan was for 2020 now we</text>
  <text start="662.23" dur="4.08">understand that there are certain</text>
  <text start="663.88" dur="4.92">individuals that are going to be running</text>
  <text start="666.31" dur="3.959">in 2020 because they do believe it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="668.8" dur="3.42">sure thing that Trump is going to be</text>
  <text start="670.269" dur="4.171">thrown out and they&amp;#39;re gonna be able to</text>
  <text start="672.22" dur="5.729">take his spot because remember their</text>
  <text start="674.44" dur="5.519">plan is to destroy the economy during</text>
  <text start="677.949" dur="5.25">this period of time what they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="679.959" dur="5.671">understand is that Trump the Patriots</text>
  <text start="683.199" dur="6.781">they&amp;#39;re in in full control right now and</text>
  <text start="685.63" dur="6.93">remember the central bank&amp;#39;s never want</text>
  <text start="689.98" dur="5.94">it to look like they brought down the</text>
  <text start="692.56" dur="6.5">economy so what is the ECB doing</text>
  <text start="695.92" dur="6.74">right now they decided you know what</text>
  <text start="699.06" dur="7.45">we&amp;#39;re not gonna raise rates right now</text>
  <text start="702.66" dur="7.21">actually we see China they&amp;#39;ve launched</text>
  <text start="706.51" dur="6.9">quantitative easing to help prop up</text>
  <text start="709.87" dur="5.159">they&amp;#39;re slowing economy everything is</text>

  <text start="722.74" dur="6.089">manipulate the economy on a statistical</text>
  <text start="726.19" dur="4.74">level to make it look fantastic he</text>
  <text start="728.829" dur="4.161">doesn&amp;#39;t want the deep state to get the</text>
  <text start="730.93" dur="5.969">upper hand during the 2020 election and</text>
  <text start="732.99" dur="5.74">who do we see who might throw their hat</text>
  <text start="736.899" dur="5.19">into the elections of 2020</text>
  <text start="738.73" dur="4.77">well Clinton because they do believe and</text>
  <text start="742.089" dur="4.981">the only reason they would do this is</text>
  <text start="743.5" dur="6.209">because they think it&amp;#39;s a sure thing but</text>
  <text start="747.07" dur="5.25">as you can see everything is being</text>
  <text start="749.709" dur="4.801">reversed they&amp;#39;re going to be in for a</text>
  <text start="752.32" dur="4.379">rude awakening they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="754.51" dur="5.16">understand why this didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="756.699" dur="5.191">because this is the card they&amp;#39;re playing</text>
  <text start="759.67" dur="4.32">bring down the economy make the people</text>
  <text start="761.89" dur="3.809">angry and once the people are angry</text>
  <text start="763.99" dur="3.719">enough because the economy is not doing</text>
  <text start="765.699" dur="5.911">well and everyone&amp;#39;s suffering they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="767.709" dur="8.581">gonna want who another candidate this is</text>
  <text start="771.61" dur="6.839">what happened during 2008 think about</text>
  <text start="776.29" dur="5.609">the stock market coming down during that</text>
  <text start="778.449" dur="5.671">period of time McCain he had no clue</text>
  <text start="781.899" dur="4.68">what was going on Obama had the upper</text>
  <text start="784.12" dur="3.81">hand at that time because he was talking</text>
  <text start="786.579" dur="4.981">about the economy saying that the</text>
  <text start="787.93" dur="5.25">economy wasn&amp;#39;t doing that well and all</text>
  <text start="791.56" dur="4.86">of a sudden it crashed McCain had no</text>
  <text start="793.18" dur="4.62">idea that the economy was so bad they</text>
  <text start="796.42" dur="2.729">didn&amp;#39;t give him the information because</text>
  <text start="797.8" dur="4.289">they wanted a certain person in there</text>
  <text start="799.149" dur="4.471">and that was Obama this time around they</text>
  <text start="802.089" dur="2.041">think they&amp;#39;re gonna use the same exact</text>
  <text start="803.62" dur="4.709">trick</text>
  <text start="804.13" dur="6.42">but the difference is Trump he has the</text>
  <text start="808.329" dur="4.111">magic wand he&amp;#39;s in control the Federal</text>
  <text start="810.55" dur="4.589">Reserve this is why the IMF is</text>
  <text start="812.44" dur="4.379">complaining and we see other central</text>
  <text start="815.139" dur="4.051">banks they&amp;#39;re starting to reverse</text>
  <text start="816.819" dur="4.26">everything that they were doing because</text>
  <text start="819.19" dur="7.379">they understand that they can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="821.079" dur="7.921">caught up in being exposed on the entire</text>
  <text start="826.569" dur="5.01">world coming down now this does not mean</text>
  <text start="829" dur="5.04">that the central bank won&amp;#39;t be exposed</text>
  <text start="831.579" dur="7.081">there&amp;#39;s a time and place for everything</text>
  <text start="834.04" dur="6.69">it&amp;#39;s all part of the plan once the</text>
  <text start="838.66" dur="6.59">election is over and Trump is in office</text>
  <text start="840.73" dur="7.919">the plan will continue all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="845.25" dur="6.16">Trump will have the freedom Trump will</text>
  <text start="848.649" dur="6.711">have the next four years Trump will have</text>
  <text start="851.41" dur="7.2">full control of the entire system</text>
  <text start="855.36" dur="6.729">phase two of the plan will then come</text>
  <text start="858.61" dur="6.899">into view we will then see him go after</text>
  <text start="862.089" dur="6.12">the central bank because what will be</text>
  <text start="865.509" dur="4.741">happening with everything else is that</text>
  <text start="868.209" dur="3.81">you&amp;#39;ll see a rest you&amp;#39;ll see everything</text>
  <text start="870.25" dur="4.589">else happening and then they can move</text>
  <text start="872.019" dur="5.55">into Phase two so everything is set for</text>
  <text start="874.839" dur="4.471">a specific time period and they</text>
  <text start="877.569" dur="4.02">understand they need to protect certain</text>
  <text start="879.31" dur="4.92">things before they can move forward</text>
  <text start="881.589" dur="4.86">they have plan they have contingency</text>
  <text start="884.23" dur="4.14">plans and they know exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="886.449" dur="3.39">doing do we know the full extent of all</text>
  <text start="888.37" dur="2.79">the plans now because this would be</text>
  <text start="889.839" dur="2.971">ridiculous because then the deep state</text>
  <text start="891.16" dur="3.27">we know the entire plans the central</text>
  <text start="892.81" dur="4.069">banks would know all the all the plans</text>
  <text start="894.43" dur="5.399">this would this would not make any sense</text>
  <text start="896.879" dur="4.81">but we can look into what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="899.829" dur="4.141">doing and we can see which direction</text>
  <text start="901.689" dur="3.811">they&amp;#39;re headed now of course there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="903.97" dur="6.39">going to be twists and turns on the way</text>
  <text start="905.5" dur="7.019">but we understand the main goal is to</text>
  <text start="910.36" dur="4.8">bring down the entire deep state</text>
  <text start="912.519" dur="4.5">apparatus to bring down the central bank</text>
  <text start="915.16" dur="4.44">apparatus because you need to do both</text>
  <text start="917.019" dur="4.651">and they&amp;#39;re going to do both and you can</text>
  <text start="919.6" dur="3.75">see we&amp;#39;re headed in that direction the</text>
