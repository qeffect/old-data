  <text start="49.94" dur="5.119">political and geopolitical news now we</text>
  <text start="53.059" dur="4.35">realize at this point that the</text>
  <text start="55.059" dur="4.991">administration the US government wants</text>
  <text start="57.409" dur="5.46">to take power away from the people away</text>
  <text start="60.05" dur="5.37">from Congress and we can see by the</text>
  <text start="62.869" dur="4.381">actions of the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="65.42" dur="4.019">they&amp;#39;ve been doing this they&amp;#39;ve been</text>

  <text start="77.81" dur="7.14">administration official Cass Sunstein</text>
  <text start="80.08" dur="9.429">has written about a Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="84.95" dur="6.72">decision which affirms a 1997 case that</text>
  <text start="89.509" dur="4.231">determined that the executive branch</text>
  <text start="91.67" dur="4.68">agencies have the authority to interpret</text>
  <text start="93.74" dur="6.33">the meaning of the regulations they</text>
  <text start="96.35" dur="5.88">write what this means is that the</text>
  <text start="100.07" dur="5.52">legislative branch and the judicial</text>
  <text start="102.23" dur="5.67">branch of government will have no role</text>
  <text start="105.59" dur="5.13">in either writing or interpreting what</text>
  <text start="107.9" dur="9.59">are de facto laws written by the</text>
  <text start="110.72" dur="6.77">executive branch it represents a huge</text>
  <text start="117.52" dur="8.26">power shift and it puts the power in the</text>
  <text start="121.97" dur="6.679">hands of the bureaucrats who in most</text>
  <text start="125.78" dur="8.55">cases answer to no elected authority</text>
  <text start="128.649" dur="10.301">this right here is deep state it&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="134.33" dur="7.65">the elites rule over us and we can see</text>
  <text start="138.95" dur="8.789">as time goes on they&amp;#39;re trying to bring</text>
  <text start="141.98" dur="8.1">in more and more power to the executive</text>
  <text start="147.739" dur="4.47">branch they don&amp;#39;t want Congress to make</text>
  <text start="150.08" dur="7.409">decisions they don&amp;#39;t want people to make</text>
  <text start="152.209" dur="8.371">decisions they want this part gone they</text>
  <text start="157.489" dur="5.491">want full control of the people the</text>
  <text start="160.58" dur="3.36">decision making basically it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="162.98" dur="3.57">dictatorship</text>
  <text start="163.94" dur="5.51">we see er de one is doing this out in</text>
  <text start="166.55" dur="6.2">turkey he will have full control of</text>
  <text start="169.45" dur="5.82">every single decision we see Obama</text>
  <text start="172.75" dur="5.5">actually pushing this idea and</text>
  <text start="175.27" dur="5.95">continually pushing this idea and of</text>
  <text start="178.25" dur="5.04">course Congress is letting him Congress</text>
  <text start="181.22" dur="6.06">needs to stand up to him or any</text>
  <text start="183.29" dur="6.39">president for that matter but they need</text>
  <text start="187.28" dur="4.61">to take control of the population and</text>
  <text start="189.68" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;ve been doing it very very slowly</text>
  <text start="191.89" dur="5.89">they&amp;#39;ve been changing the way our</text>
  <text start="195.62" dur="5.76">children learn they brought in Common</text>
  <text start="197.78" dur="6.3">Core teaching them things that they want</text>
  <text start="201.38" dur="5.22">the children to know from the</text>
  <text start="204.08" dur="5.49">perspective of government that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="206.6" dur="5.78">what it&amp;#39;s about the perspective where</text>
  <text start="209.57" dur="8.01">the rights are really privet privileges</text>
  <text start="212.38" dur="8.52">where they can be taken away and we know</text>
  <text start="217.58" dur="5.79">in the end they want a cashless society</text>
  <text start="220.9" dur="5.56">now think about this this was on</text>
  <text start="223.37" dur="5.43">corporate media I&amp;#39;m one of the news</text>
  <text start="226.46" dur="7.2">stations where they were talking about</text>
  <text start="228.8" dur="7.47">microchips and we know today that cats</text>
  <text start="233.66" dur="4.74">and dogs they get microchips over there</text>
  <text start="236.27" dur="3.9">you know if they go missing you can</text>
  <text start="238.4" dur="4.02">track them down very easily now these</text>
  <text start="240.17" dur="5.16">chips they&amp;#39;re very very small there I</text>
  <text start="242.42" dur="5.58">have RFID chips they can be surgically</text>
  <text start="245.33" dur="4.23">implanted and of course the corporate</text>
  <text start="248" dur="3.959">media is out there is saying that you</text>
  <text start="249.56" dur="5.1">know they&amp;#39;re perfectly safe there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="251.959" dur="5.191">effects from your body there nothing</text>
  <text start="254.66" dur="5.579">happens to your body there there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="257.15" dur="5.72">absolutely nothing leg and go wrong the</text>
  <text start="260.239" dur="7.321">implant is perfect perfectly safe and</text>
  <text start="262.87" dur="7.33">now they&amp;#39;re using the idea of why</text>
  <text start="267.56" dur="5.87">children should get this now back in the</text>
  <text start="270.2" dur="5.46">70s and 80s when we had kidnappings and</text>
  <text start="273.43" dur="4.66">then we come to find out it was the</text>
  <text start="275.66" dur="6.15">divorce you know father or mother that</text>
  <text start="278.09" dur="5.61">took the child everyone went in and I</text>
  <text start="281.81" dur="3.81">remember this getting everyone was</text>
  <text start="283.7" dur="4.469">fingerprinted because this was going to</text>
  <text start="285.62" dur="4.83">keep you safe they&amp;#39;d be able to find you</text>
  <text start="288.169" dur="4.411">if something happened well that&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="290.45" dur="4.38">if you left a fingerprint someplace but</text>
  <text start="292.58" dur="4.8">otherwise they couldn&amp;#39;t find you</text>
  <text start="294.83" dur="6.48">now they do this and they scare everyone</text>
  <text start="297.38" dur="6.99">and they use safety they&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="301.31" dur="7.08">same thing today they&amp;#39;re saying we need</text>
  <text start="304.37" dur="6.32">to keep our children safe and one way of</text>
  <text start="308.39" dur="5.34">doing this is putting these chips into</text>
  <text start="310.69" dur="5.32">their bodies this way if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="313.73" dur="4.53">kidnapped or they go missing somehow</text>
  <text start="316.01" dur="6.99">some way we can track them very easily</text>
  <text start="318.26" dur="7.95">and of course it sounds good but then</text>
  <text start="323" dur="4.98">there&amp;#39;s other complications because</text>
  <text start="326.21" dur="4.32">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen and</text>
  <text start="327.98" dur="5.28">think about this once they have our</text>
  <text start="330.53" dur="7.83">children chipped and this goes on for</text>
  <text start="333.26" dur="8.76">another generation the population is now</text>
  <text start="338.36" dur="5.19">all chipped it&amp;#39;s a very slow process but</text>
  <text start="342.02" dur="4.05">they will be able to get everyone</text>
  <text start="343.55" dur="5.04">chipped because everyone entering the</text>
  <text start="346.07" dur="4.05">school system will be trip then what</text>
  <text start="348.59" dur="4.26">they will do they&amp;#39;ll throw on top of</text>
  <text start="350.12" dur="3.93">this a counselor society remember this</text>
  <text start="352.85" dur="5.54">is what they want they want everything</text>
  <text start="354.05" dur="8.87">electronic if you do not have a chip</text>
  <text start="358.39" dur="7.72">guess what you can&amp;#39;t purchase anything</text>
  <text start="362.92" dur="5.82">you&amp;#39;re not going to be cards they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="366.11" dur="5.58">going to be chips in your cards</text>
  <text start="368.74" dur="7.18">everything that is done will be from the</text>
  <text start="371.69" dur="6.78">chip in your body so you can see where</text>
  <text start="375.92" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re headed with this you can see</text>
  <text start="378.47" dur="8.25">their thought process and this and how</text>
  <text start="381.59" dur="7.59">slowly they will move to do this and of</text>
  <text start="386.72" dur="6.72">course they&amp;#39;re saying that this is going</text>
  <text start="389.18" dur="6.65">to happen very soon and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="393.44" dur="6.9">that everyone should just accept it and</text>
  <text start="395.83" dur="6.01">we have to remember last month there was</text>
  <text start="400.34" dur="3.51">a secret meeting that involved about a</text>
  <text start="401.84" dur="3.42">hundred executives from some of the</text>
  <text start="403.85" dur="2.64">biggest financial institutions in the</text>
  <text start="405.26" dur="4.29">United States and was held in New York</text>
  <text start="406.49" dur="6.15">City and during this meeting a company</text>
  <text start="409.55" dur="5.64">known as chain unveiled technology that</text>
  <text start="412.64" dur="5.79">transforms US dollars into pure digital</text>
  <text start="415.19" dur="6.3">assets start putting all of this</text>
  <text start="418.43" dur="5.66">together and this shows you the</text>
  <text start="421.49" dur="4.62">direction that they&amp;#39;re going in and</text>
  <text start="424.09" dur="4.09">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="426.11" dur="2.28">they&amp;#39;re going to include your medical</text>
  <text start="428.18" dur="2.88">and</text>
  <text start="428.39" dur="6.03">mation they&amp;#39;re going to use it to track</text>
  <text start="431.06" dur="6.18">you they&amp;#39;re going to use this where they</text>
  <text start="434.42" dur="6.81">can say okay you can pay your bills you</text>
  <text start="437.24" dur="7.92">can access a building and at this point</text>
  <text start="441.23" dur="8.27">they are making the move to convince the</text>
  <text start="445.16" dur="8.07">population that this is a good thing and</text>
  <text start="449.5" dur="6.52">this is the way they keep track of their</text>
  <text start="453.23" dur="6.06">sheep think about a farmer who has a</text>
  <text start="456.02" dur="6.72">herd who puts a branding or in many</text>
  <text start="459.29" dur="6.6">cases now they chip their animals so</text>
  <text start="462.74" dur="5.13">they don&amp;#39;t go missing this is exactly</text>
  <text start="465.89" dur="5.37">what the elite the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="467.87" dur="5.07">doing to the people around the world not</text>
  <text start="471.26" dur="4.29">just in this country but around the</text>
  <text start="472.94" dur="6.53">world this is going to be everywhere</text>
  <text start="475.55" dur="7.98">this is their major plan and as a people</text>
  <text start="479.47" dur="5.26">we should not accept this as a people we</text>
  <text start="483.53" dur="2.97">should say you know something if I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="484.73" dur="3.63">want something in my body I don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="486.5" dur="5.21">to have something in my body I have</text>
  <text start="488.36" dur="8.04">rights and if we don&amp;#39;t make a stand and</text>
