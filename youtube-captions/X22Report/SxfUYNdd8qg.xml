  <text start="107.08" dur="7.41">the government operating costs that&amp;#39;s it</text>

  <text start="115.599" dur="5.25">revenue coming into the country and it</text>
  <text start="117.64" dur="4.89">cannot be supported things really then</text>
  <text start="120.849" dur="3.961">start to fall apart and the people say</text>
  <text start="122.53" dur="4.199">okay we&amp;#39;ve had enough at once again this</text>
  <text start="124.81" dur="4.53">is not working out for us and we will</text>
  <text start="126.729" dur="4.381">see this occur where the people say okay</text>
  <text start="129.34" dur="5.67">enough is enough we can&amp;#39;t take it</text>
  <text start="131.11" dur="6.45">anymore because it reaches a point where</text>
  <text start="135.01" dur="6.21">the people say we gave you a chance and</text>
  <text start="137.56" dur="6.24">we are done here it happens every single</text>
  <text start="141.22" dur="4.739">time here in the United States the</text>
  <text start="143.8" dur="4.53">illusion is completely falling apart yes</text>
  <text start="145.959" dur="3.721">they can manipulate some numbers they</text>
  <text start="148.33" dur="3.78">can make it look good but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="149.68" dur="5.97">seeing right now is the real economic</text>
  <text start="152.11" dur="5.459">indicators they&amp;#39;re separating from what</text>
  <text start="155.65" dur="4.85">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="157.569" dur="5.971">bankers can control they can manipulate</text>
  <text start="160.5" dur="6.4">they can modify the</text>
  <text start="163.54" dur="5.36">can massage the numbers but there are</text>
  <text start="166.9" dur="4.77">certain things they just can&amp;#39;t touch and</text>
  <text start="168.9" dur="5.08">it gets harder and harder as time goes</text>
  <text start="171.67" dur="4.739">on and people are starting to notice</text>
  <text start="173.98" dur="4.89">that these economic indicators that are</text>
  <text start="176.409" dur="3.69">coming in don&amp;#39;t support what the</text>
  <text start="178.87" dur="3.81">government and the central bank is</text>
  <text start="180.099" dur="5.551">telling us and we&amp;#39;ve been through this</text>
  <text start="182.68" dur="5.009">recovery now for what seven years</text>
  <text start="185.65" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re telling us that we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="187.689" dur="5.52">recovery for seven years think about</text>
  <text start="190.15" dur="5.759">that for a second shouldn&amp;#39;t we be out of</text>
  <text start="193.209" dur="5.071">this recovery but if we look back from</text>
  <text start="195.909" dur="4.491">2008 going forward the economy has done</text>
  <text start="198.28" dur="6.03">absolutely nothing it&amp;#39;s stagnant</text>
  <text start="200.4" dur="6.429">actually it&amp;#39;s declining I mean we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="204.31" dur="4.92">getting information that existing home</text>
  <text start="206.829" dur="5.61">sales they have crashed by ten point</text>
  <text start="209.23" dur="7.53">five percent this is the worst November</text>
  <text start="212.439" dur="5.821">drop ever yes we had a lot of snow yes</text>
  <text start="216.76" dur="3">the weight the weather wasn&amp;#39;t bad</text>
  <text start="218.26" dur="4.259">actually the weather was kind of</text>
  <text start="219.76" dur="8.25">pleasant so this doesn&amp;#39;t fit into their</text>
  <text start="222.519" dur="7.021">meme so why did housing fall apart well</text>
  <text start="228.01" dur="4.92">they were only expecting a point two</text>
  <text start="229.54" dur="9.229">percent drop but this is a complete and</text>
  <text start="232.93" dur="9.449">utter gigantic miss and when you look at</text>
  <text start="238.769" dur="6.43">the total existing home sales on an</text>
  <text start="242.379" dur="7.381">annualized rate we&amp;#39;re at two year lows</text>
  <text start="245.199" dur="7.71">right now the medium home prices have</text>
  <text start="249.76" dur="5.849">fallen and now they&amp;#39;re flat and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="252.909" dur="4.95">going to be falling once again people</text>
  <text start="255.609" dur="4.68">are finding out that it&amp;#39;s getting harder</text>
  <text start="257.859" dur="4.831">and harder to sell their homes are on</text>
  <text start="260.289" dur="5.761">the markets now over a hundred and</text>
  <text start="262.69" dur="5.699">eighty days normally the existing home</text>
  <text start="266.05" dur="4.56">sales are those people trying to get out</text>
  <text start="268.389" dur="5.181">of their homes trying to upgrade and the</text>
  <text start="270.61" dur="5.16">new generation is normally coming in and</text>
  <text start="273.57" dur="3.64">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now since the</text>
  <text start="275.77" dur="4.53">new generation which is coming out of</text>
  <text start="277.21" dur="5.16">high school college they can&amp;#39;t find work</text>
  <text start="280.3" dur="4.77">they can&amp;#39;t find the high paying jobs</text>
  <text start="282.37" dur="4.079">they can&amp;#39;t save the money and this is</text>
  <text start="285.07" dur="2.64">going to be very difficult but when we</text>
  <text start="286.449" dur="3.241">look around the country what do we see</text>
  <text start="287.71" dur="4.319">existing home sales in the Northeast</text>
  <text start="289.69" dur="6.69">declined by nine point two percent the</text>
  <text start="292.029" dur="5.351">Midwest by 15.4 percent the south six</text>
  <text start="296.38" dur="4.72">point two percent</text>
  <text start="297.38" dur="6.03">and in the West 13.9 % but don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="301.1" dur="3.66">lawrence yun from the national</text>
  <text start="303.41" dur="4.41">association of realtors the chief</text>
  <text start="304.76" dur="5.13">economist who said that will be coming</text>
  <text start="307.82" dur="4.53">out of this back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="309.89" dur="4.92">in october saying this is just a little</text>
  <text start="312.35" dur="4.77">bump in the road winter looks really</text>
  <text start="314.81" dur="4.38">strong and again he was completely wrong</text>
  <text start="317.12" dur="4.53">but this time he&amp;#39;s saying there are</text>
  <text start="319.19" dur="5.4">multiple factors that led to November&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="321.65" dur="6.44">sales decline but the primary reason</text>
  <text start="324.59" dur="8.46">could be that you know that new law</text>
  <text start="328.09" dur="6.34">which says no before your a rule no</text>
  <text start="333.05" dur="4.65">before you&amp;#39;re taking out the new</text>
  <text start="334.43" dur="6.42">mortgage now they use this before when</text>
  <text start="337.7" dur="5.34">real estate increase they said how the</text>
  <text start="340.85" dur="3.72">new rules making it easier now that the</text>
  <text start="343.04" dur="3.54">real estate is decreasing they say oh it</text>
  <text start="344.57" dur="4.86">must be the new rule once again no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="346.58" dur="5.1">the economy no it&amp;#39;s the people that are</text>
  <text start="349.43" dur="3.54">being laid off no it&amp;#39;s the people are</text>
  <text start="351.68" dur="3.69">saying you know something this is not a</text>
  <text start="352.97" dur="5.28">good time to purchase a home because</text>
  <text start="355.37" dur="4.77">this matches the applications for</text>
  <text start="358.25" dur="7.23">mortgages which is continually on a</text>
  <text start="360.14" dur="6.9">downward trend and we see that the</text>
  <text start="365.48" dur="2.88">United States government is out there</text>
  <text start="367.04" dur="3.51">trying to convince everyone that the</text>
  <text start="368.36" dur="4.05">economy is doing well they came in with</text>
  <text start="370.55" dur="5.34">their manipulated GDP number of 2.1</text>
  <text start="372.41" dur="6.75">percent as where they throw in Obamacare</text>
  <text start="375.89" dur="8.49">they have all this inventory which is</text>
  <text start="379.16" dur="8.91">still included in this and it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="384.38" dur="7.77">building up at this point and they</text>
  <text start="388.07" dur="8.55">continually modify manipulate these</text>
  <text start="392.15" dur="7.32">numbers to fit their story but when we</text>
  <text start="396.62" dur="5.13">look outside of their manipulation it</text>
  <text start="399.47" dur="6.33">doesn&amp;#39;t fit what so ever look at the</text>
  <text start="401.75" dur="7.68">bowl to dry index it&amp;#39;s at 474 points</text>
  <text start="405.8" dur="7.59">right now and throughout these last</text>
  <text start="409.43" dur="6.69">couple of months it&amp;#39;s been around 600 or</text>
  <text start="413.39" dur="5.61">less so does any of this make any sense</text>
  <text start="416.12" dur="5.55">whatsoever I guess they can get rid of</text>
  <text start="419" dur="6.53">manufacturing and just include people</text>
  <text start="421.67" dur="6.74">going out to eat people going and</text>
  <text start="425.53" dur="5.59">getting jobs as bartenders and waiters</text>
  <text start="428.41" dur="5.95">including research and development in</text>
  <text start="431.12" dur="6.42">including Obamacare including everything</text>
  <text start="434.36" dur="5.25">but what manufacturing I mean this is</text>
  <text start="437.54" dur="4.77">how they&amp;#39;re continually manipulating all</text>
  <text start="439.61" dur="5.94">of these numbers now since Obama has</text>
  <text start="442.31" dur="7.02">taken office he has taken the debt from</text>
  <text start="445.55" dur="5.58">ten point six trillion back in January</text>
  <text start="449.33" dur="6.35">of 20 january twentieth of two thousand</text>
  <text start="451.13" dur="7.8">nine to eighteen point seven trillion</text>
  <text start="455.68" dur="6.37">which was recorded on december 21st 2015</text>
  <text start="458.93" dur="5.459">that means the debt that we are passing</text>
  <text start="462.05" dur="5.04">on to our future generations has</text>
  <text start="464.389" dur="6.331">increased by eight point one six</text>
  <text start="467.09" dur="6.18">trillion dollars since obama was</text>
  <text start="470.72" dur="5.55">inaugurated so that means we are</text>
  <text start="473.27" dur="5.459">stealing more than 100 million dollars</text>
  <text start="476.27" dur="9.47">from the future generation of Americans</text>
  <text start="478.729" dur="7.011">every single hour of every single day</text>
  <text start="486.31" dur="9.55">this cannot go on and like every system</text>
  <text start="491.83" dur="9.37">that works in continually adding debt it</text>
  <text start="495.86" dur="8.429">will crash and the manufacturing jobs</text>
  <text start="501.2" dur="5.969">the high-paying jobs none of this is</text>
  <text start="504.289" dur="4.111">coming back to America I know they keep</text>
  <text start="507.169" dur="3.541">talking about this actually they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="508.4" dur="3.93">talking about this for 20 odd years that</text>
  <text start="510.71" dur="4.53">manufacturing is going to be coming back</text>
  <text start="512.33" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t worry we&amp;#39;re putting in NAFTA we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="515.24" dur="4.679">going to be putting in other things</text>
  <text start="516.44" dur="6.899">guess what all of it&amp;#39;s a lie the reality</text>
  <text start="519.919" dur="5.251">is that roughly half of all US base</text>
  <text start="523.339" dur="6.151">global corporate sales and profits are</text>
  <text start="525.17" dur="6.33">reaped overseas it makes zero financial</text>
  <text start="529.49" dur="4.14">sense to pay a US worker twenty dollars</text>
  <text start="531.5" dur="5.16">an hour and pay the insanely expensive</text>
  <text start="533.63" dur="5.07">cost of sick care healthcare in the US</text>
  <text start="536.66" dur="4.049">when the work can be done closer to the</text>
  <text start="538.7" dur="5.54">actual markets for goods and services at</text>
  <text start="540.709" dur="6.541">a fraction of the cost someplace else</text>
  <text start="544.24" dur="5.969">this is why corporations manufacturers</text>
  <text start="547.25" dur="8.93">have been leaving the United States</text>
  <text start="550.209" dur="11.021">they&amp;#39;re not coming back so over the past</text>
  <text start="556.18" dur="8.77">years we have seen wages continually</text>
  <text start="561.23" dur="5.88">fall as a percentage of GDP</text>
  <text start="564.95" dur="7.4">wages have been declining for decades</text>
  <text start="567.11" dur="12.24">self employment is basically declining</text>
  <text start="572.35" dur="14.83">since 1940s I mean what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="579.35" dur="12.98">here is a dying system and at this point</text>
  <text start="587.18" dur="7.71">the way we are this cannot be recovered</text>
  <text start="592.33" dur="5.85">no matter what they say no matter what</text>
  <text start="594.89" dur="8.19">they do no matter what why they tell us</text>
  <text start="598.18" dur="9.52">we need to restart everything we need to</text>
  <text start="603.08" dur="10.7">get rid of the central bank and we need</text>
  <text start="607.7" dur="9.27">to govern ourselves working like this</text>
  <text start="613.78" dur="6.9">having a government like this report to</text>
  <text start="616.97" dur="6.12">the central bank is never going to work</text>
  <text start="620.68" dur="4.18">because what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is</text>
  <text start="623.09" dur="4.56">there looking all over the world for</text>
  <text start="624.86" dur="5.16">revenue because they realize the system</text>
  <text start="627.65" dur="5.04">is dying this is why they created FATCA</text>
  <text start="630.02" dur="5.01">and other laws and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="632.69" dur="7.37">different countries saying listen you</text>
  <text start="635.03" dur="8.46">need to hand over the American customers</text>
  <text start="640.06" dur="4.87">what bank accounts with you and you need</text>
  <text start="643.49" dur="4.68">to provide us with all the information</text>
  <text start="644.93" dur="5.13">this way we can tax them and a lot of</text>
  <text start="648.17" dur="3.57">countries are saying well no we&amp;#39;re not</text>
