  <text start="66.46" dur="6.03">for a new Middle East event let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="70.33" dur="4.89">into the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="72.49" dur="6.24">geopolitical news now we understand that</text>
  <text start="75.22" dur="6.95">the social media outlets Facebook</text>
  <text start="78.73" dur="6.87">YouTube Google Twitter and the rest</text>
  <text start="82.17" dur="5.35">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to silence the</text>
  <text start="85.6" dur="4.769">alternative media or anyone that wants</text>
  <text start="87.52" dur="5.25">to speak out against their agenda and</text>
  <text start="90.369" dur="3.781">what they believe is the truth and what</text>
  <text start="92.77" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re trying to spew is the truth</text>
  <text start="94.15" dur="4.95">which is really propaganda and if you</text>
  <text start="96.52" dur="5.52">counter anything they say they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="99.1" dur="6.21">trying over the past to maybe shut you</text>
  <text start="102.04" dur="5.34">down maybe to ban you maybe to give you</text>
  <text start="105.31" dur="4.23">strikes on your account they do whatever</text>
  <text start="107.38" dur="3.42">they possibly can and during this period</text>
  <text start="109.54" dur="4.38">of time what they like to do is they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="110.8" dur="5.04">like to change the Terms of Service you</text>
  <text start="113.92" dur="3.3">know they&amp;#39;d like to change the rules of</text>
  <text start="115.84" dur="3.21">the game so if you&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="117.22" dur="3.51">something all of a sudden they could say</text>
  <text start="119.05" dur="3.48">well hell that&amp;#39;s against our rules now</text>
  <text start="120.73" dur="4.62">because we just changed them yesterday</text>
  <text start="122.53" dur="5.19">and we see Twitter they just changed</text>
  <text start="125.35" dur="5.519">their Terms of Service now the changes</text>
  <text start="127.72" dur="6">can be seen in the abusive behavior</text>
  <text start="130.869" dur="4.861">sections which currently states we</text>
  <text start="133.72" dur="6.51">believe in freedom of expression and</text>
  <text start="135.73" dur="8.07">open dialog and in the past what it used</text>
  <text start="140.23" dur="6.24">to say was we believe in freedom of</text>
  <text start="143.8" dur="6.93">expression and speaking truth to power</text>
  <text start="146.47" dur="7.08">and they got caught in the crossfire</text>
  <text start="150.73" dur="5.55">over internet free speech and Russian</text>
  <text start="153.55" dur="5.219">conspiracy theories while they were</text>
  <text start="156.28" dur="4.59">giving testimony in front of Congress in</text>
  <text start="158.769" dur="3.69">a congressional hearing which was meant</text>
  <text start="160.87" dur="4.74">to root out Russian interference by</text>
  <text start="162.459" dur="5.401">Twitter accounts and basically you know</text>
  <text start="165.61" dur="4.02">find out what they&amp;#39;re doing to control</text>
  <text start="167.86" dur="3.599">this and things like that and we also</text>
  <text start="169.63" dur="4.2">know that Trump&amp;#39;s Twitter account was</text>
  <text start="171.459" dur="5.25">shut down for 11 minutes from a</text>
  <text start="173.83" dur="4.65">disgruntled employee but all these</text>
  <text start="176.709" dur="3.361">social media outlets what they like to</text>
  <text start="178.48" dur="4.68">do is they like to change the Terms of</text>
  <text start="180.07" dur="5.639">Service and they do this quite often and</text>
  <text start="183.16" dur="3.99">we see that you know Google YouTube</text>
  <text start="185.709" dur="2.67">Facebook and the rest</text>
  <text start="187.15" dur="3.72">they also do it but they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="188.379" dur="4.58">questioned by Congress trying to</text>
  <text start="190.87" dur="5.31">understand what they&amp;#39;re trying to do and</text>
  <text start="192.959" dur="6.161">what moves they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="196.18" dur="7.02">against you know those people who are</text>
  <text start="199.12" dur="6.8">speaking out now i saw in trey gowdy who</text>
  <text start="203.2" dur="5.129">was up there talking to facebook and</text>
  <text start="205.92" dur="5.019">what they were saying didn&amp;#39;t even make</text>
  <text start="208.329" dur="3.901">sense I mean I&amp;#39;m talking about what</text>
  <text start="210.939" dur="2.281">Facebook was saying to trey Gowdy</text>
  <text start="212.23" dur="3.81">because trey Gowdy was trying to</text>
  <text start="213.22" dur="5.099">understand what was really going on with</text>
  <text start="216.04" dur="3.539">Facebook and what they were trying to do</text>
  <text start="218.319" dur="3.241">and they were trying to say well if</text>
  <text start="219.579" dur="4.77">you&amp;#39;re a person and we know who you are</text>
  <text start="221.56" dur="4.829">and you&amp;#39;re authorized then we believe</text>
  <text start="224.349" dur="4.351">what you say so trey Gowdy said listen</text>
  <text start="226.389" dur="4.261">ok You Know Who I am and they said yes</text>
  <text start="228.7" dur="6.27">we know who you are and if I say you</text>
  <text start="230.65" dur="6.209">know the Sun rises from the West and</text>
  <text start="234.97" dur="4.53">sets in the east is that ok because you</text>
  <text start="236.859" dur="5.52">know who I am I&amp;#39;m authorized I&amp;#39;m you</text>
  <text start="239.5" dur="5.01">know basically you&amp;#39;re saying that&amp;#39;s okay</text>
  <text start="242.379" dur="4.291">then and they really had no answer</text>
  <text start="244.51" dur="6.689">because what they what they look at is</text>
  <text start="246.67" dur="7.74">anyone that is certified by them that</text>
  <text start="251.199" dur="5.581">means they&amp;#39;re telling the truth and trey</text>
  <text start="254.41" dur="4.949">Gowdy was saying well I&amp;#39;ll be if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="256.78" dur="4.889">certified and you&amp;#39;re saying it is me and</text>
  <text start="259.359" dur="5.161">you&amp;#39;re saying I&amp;#39;m an up and up type of</text>
  <text start="261.669" dur="5.93">person I can say whatever I want even if</text>
  <text start="264.52" dur="6.72">it&amp;#39;s a lie but you&amp;#39;ll still allow it</text>
  <text start="267.599" dur="5.621">because I&amp;#39;m certified and they got into</text>
  <text start="271.24" dur="3.48">this type of argument and the whole</text>
  <text start="273.22" dur="3.9">thing from Facebook didn&amp;#39;t even make</text>
  <text start="274.72" dur="5.699">sense so we can see they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="277.12" dur="7.47">figure out a way to let everyone know</text>
  <text start="280.419" dur="6.451">that yes you know ABC NBC CNN they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="284.59" dur="5.22">certified so guess what you can believe</text>
  <text start="286.87" dur="5.85">them all the other people you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="289.81" dur="6">believe them and it doesn&amp;#39;t hold up</text>
  <text start="292.72" dur="5.52">because just because you are who you are</text>
  <text start="295.81" dur="5.789">doesn&amp;#39;t mean you&amp;#39;re gonna tell the truth</text>
  <text start="298.24" dur="7.2">it makes no sense and the fact checking</text>
  <text start="301.599" dur="6.991">that doesn&amp;#39;t even work well we see out</text>
  <text start="305.44" dur="6.449">with the uranium one deal well things</text>
  <text start="308.59" dur="5.49">are starting to really heat up now John</text>
  <text start="311.889" dur="4.201">McCain is now being dragged into this</text>
  <text start="314.08" dur="4.709">now we know that they&amp;#39;re looking into</text>
  <text start="316.09" dur="5.01">Clinton&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re looking into what has</text>
  <text start="318.789" dur="4.441">happened there they realized</text>
  <text start="321.1" dur="3.51">man afford is now leading them to the</text>
  <text start="323.23" dur="4.98">clintons leading to the Clinton</text>
  <text start="324.61" dur="6.27">Foundation and now a McCain he was</text>
  <text start="328.21" dur="5.64">notified by official documents that the</text>
  <text start="330.88" dur="5.85">uranium was being transferred to Moscow</text>
  <text start="333.85" dur="5.88">in 2015 now he passed it off to a</text>
  <text start="336.73" dur="4.71">congressional liaison rather than handle</text>
  <text start="339.73" dur="3.39">it himself</text>
  <text start="341.44" dur="3.09">because he is a ranking member of</text>
  <text start="343.12" dur="3.96">Homeland Security and Governmental</text>
  <text start="344.53" dur="4.41">Affairs Committee and the investigations</text>
  <text start="347.08" dur="4.86">committee but he didn&amp;#39;t even look at it</text>
  <text start="348.94" dur="5.67">but he knew it was going on he knew</text>
  <text start="351.94" dur="4.65">exactly was going on and he didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="354.61" dur="5.22">to get involved because this whole thing</text>
  <text start="356.59" dur="4.92">was an inside job believe me it was not</text>
  <text start="359.83" dur="3.63">just the Clintons there are so many</text>
  <text start="361.51" dur="4.47">other people that are corrupt in</text>
  <text start="363.46" dur="5.1">government that all of this is starting</text>
  <text start="365.98" dur="6.75">to come out now Trump is now out in</text>
  <text start="368.56" dur="6.03">Japan and he&amp;#39;s wondering why Japan just</text>
  <text start="372.73" dur="4.59">didn&amp;#39;t shoot down North Korea&amp;#39;s missiles</text>
  <text start="374.59" dur="3.81">now it seems kind of funny and people</text>
  <text start="377.32" dur="2.91">are out there saying that he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="378.4" dur="3.27">make a sale where he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="380.23" dur="2.73">convince Japan to buy more military</text>
  <text start="381.67" dur="4.83">assets which of course he&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="382.96" dur="6.69">trying to do but the question is why</text>
  <text start="386.5" dur="5.52">didn&amp;#39;t Japan shoot down North Korea&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="389.65" dur="5.46">missile I mean if you see a missile</text>
  <text start="392.02" dur="4.65">heading towards your country wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="395.11" dur="4.23">the wouldn&amp;#39;t that be the first thing you</text>
  <text start="396.67" dur="4.2">do is try to shoot it down the reason I</text>
  <text start="399.34" dur="3.42">think they didn&amp;#39;t shoot it down is</text>
  <text start="400.87" dur="4.53">because I don&amp;#39;t believe that these</text>
  <text start="402.76" dur="4.83">systems are capable of doing it and</text>
  <text start="405.4" dur="4.74">actually we do have experts out there</text>
  <text start="407.59" dur="4.23">that say they say the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="410.14" dur="3.57">that the ability to shoot down the</text>
  <text start="411.82" dur="3.72">missile launch by North Korea they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="413.71" dur="3.75">saying that this cannot be done with</text>
  <text start="415.54" dur="4.95">Japan sea based Aegis missile defense</text>
  <text start="417.46" dur="5.46">system it would have to be placed much</text>
  <text start="420.49" dur="4.26">closer to North Korean coast to have a</text>
  <text start="422.92" dur="4.59">chance of intercepting and destroying a</text>
  <text start="424.75" dur="4.53">missile because you have to look at how</text>
  <text start="427.51" dur="5.1">the missile takes off and how it arcs</text>
  <text start="429.28" dur="5.61">and they&amp;#39;re saying that this system</text>
  <text start="432.61" dur="6.72">would not work so if they tried to shoot</text>
  <text start="434.89" dur="7.41">it down and they missed guess what all</text>
  <text start="439.33" dur="5.94">sales would be off people would be like</text>
  <text start="442.3" dur="5.85">okay this system does not work and this</text>
  <text start="445.27" dur="5.43">would be a big problem this is why we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="448.15" dur="4.38">never seen anyone try to shoot it down I</text>
  <text start="450.7" dur="3.24">mean they&amp;#39;re complaining of how close</text>
  <text start="452.53" dur="2.49">the missiles are coming they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="453.94" dur="3.629">complaining that they could be</text>
  <text start="455.02" dur="5.22">the Guam but they don&amp;#39;t have the ability</text>
  <text start="457.569" dur="4.831">to shoot it down now I know the u.s. did</text>
  <text start="460.24" dur="4.26">some tests but they knew the trajectory</text>
  <text start="462.4" dur="3.84">they knew the speed they knew the type</text>
  <text start="464.5" dur="3.69">of missile they knew it was when it was</text>
  <text start="466.24" dur="4.079">gonna be launched they knew everything</text>
  <text start="468.19" dur="3.539">and they set it up perfectly and they</text>
  <text start="470.319" dur="3.271">were able to shoot it down now the</text>
  <text start="471.729" dur="6.241">Pentagon is out there and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="473.59" dur="8.13">listen to rid or secure the North Korean</text>
  <text start="477.97" dur="7.919">nuclear sites we would have to invade</text>
  <text start="481.72" dur="5.939">North Korea now if we did go ahead and</text>
  <text start="485.889" dur="4.201">this is coming from the Pentagon if we</text>
  <text start="487.659" dur="6.061">did invade North Korea you know there&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="490.09" dur="7.049">be some casualties about 300,000 people</text>
  <text start="493.72" dur="5.28">in North Korea would be dead in the</text>
  <text start="497.139" dur="4.321">first couple of days maybe a hundred</text>
  <text start="499" dur="5.669">thousand Americans they might be</text>
  <text start="501.46" dur="4.769">potentially at risk and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="504.669" dur="3.99">doing right now is they&amp;#39;re building up</text>
  <text start="506.229" dur="4.141">the propaganda that this might be a</text>
  <text start="508.659" dur="4.081">possibility and they&amp;#39;re trying to use</text>
  <text start="510.37" dur="5.82">the weapons of mass destruction hoax</text>
  <text start="512.74" dur="4.739">like they did with Iraq with North Korea</text>
  <text start="516.19" dur="4.639">because they&amp;#39;re saying that North Korea</text>
  <text start="517.479" dur="7.1">well they might be you know building</text>
  <text start="520.829" dur="7.351">maybe chemical or biological weapons</text>
  <text start="524.579" dur="7.121">underground and we better get in there</text>
  <text start="528.18" dur="5.469">before they use these type of weapons so</text>
  <text start="531.7" dur="3.75">we can see they&amp;#39;re trying to push the</text>
  <text start="533.649" dur="3.541">agenda and trying to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="535.45" dur="3.84">that we need to go in there but I think</text>
  <text start="537.19" dur="3.62">in the back end with Trump Tillerson</text>
  <text start="539.29" dur="4.44">Russia China</text>
  <text start="540.81" dur="5.5">Duterte and the rest I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="543.73" dur="4.38">trying to have these talks where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="546.31" dur="3.719">talking peace where they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="548.11" dur="4.02">calm the situation down and the Cabal</text>
  <text start="550.029" dur="4.021">certain and members in Pentagon that are</text>
  <text start="552.13" dur="3.42">part of the Cabal they want war and</text>
  <text start="554.05" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re trying to push us as hard as I</text>
  <text start="555.55" dur="4.56">possibly can now we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="557.95" dur="4.35">about how the Cabal might try to push</text>
  <text start="560.11" dur="4.68">another event in the Middle East and</text>
  <text start="562.3" dur="5.34">something very interesting is happening</text>
  <text start="564.79" dur="4.32">out in Saudi Arabia a Saudi prince who</text>
  <text start="567.64" dur="3.72">was deputy governor of the kingdom&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="569.11" dur="6.84">Azure province died in a helicopter</text>
  <text start="571.36" dur="7.14">crash on November 5th now the prince the</text>
  <text start="575.95" dur="3.81">son of the former Crown Prince was in</text>
  <text start="578.5" dur="3.959">the southern part of the kingdom near</text>
  <text start="579.76" dur="4.62">Yemen when the aircraft went down now</text>
  <text start="582.459" dur="3.541">the crash occurred one day after the</text>
  <text start="584.38" dur="4.18">Houthi rebels in Yemen launched a</text>
  <text start="586" dur="5.92">ballistic missile at an airport in the</text>
  <text start="588.56" dur="5.01">Saudi capital now they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="591.92" dur="4.05">they intercepted and destroyed the</text>
  <text start="593.57" dur="3.81">missile and nothing really happened now</text>
  <text start="595.97" dur="2.79">again we don&amp;#39;t know if this really</text>
  <text start="597.38" dur="4.2">happened this could be something that</text>
  <text start="598.76" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re just saying and again are the</text>
  <text start="601.58" dur="5.67">Houthis really firing ballistic missiles</text>
  <text start="604.07" dur="4.59">into Saudi Arabia right now it really</text>
  <text start="607.25" dur="2.55">doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense why they would</text>
  <text start="608.66" dur="3.66">start doing this when they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="609.8" dur="7.41">defend and fight off the invading force</text>
  <text start="612.32" dur="8.31">in their country now Saudi Arabia is</text>
  <text start="617.21" dur="8.04">saying that this missile launch was a</text>
  <text start="620.63" dur="6.45">blatant act of aggression by Iran and we</text>
  <text start="625.25" dur="5.49">see a lot of things happening in Saudi</text>
  <text start="627.08" dur="7.11">Arabia first of all Saudi Arabia it</text>
  <text start="630.74" dur="5.91">looks like they are cleaning house and</text>
  <text start="634.19" dur="7.05">they&amp;#39;re getting rid of certain</text>
  <text start="636.65" dur="6.95">individuals in the Saudi system now</text>
  <text start="641.24" dur="5.25">Saudi banks begun freezing accounts of</text>

  <text start="835.91" dur="4.799">see some type of major false flag happen</text>
  <text start="838.07" dur="5.49">because like I said they are running out</text>
  <text start="840.709" dur="5.041">of time right now and it looks like</text>
  <text start="843.56" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;re getting ready to push some type</text>
  <text start="845.75" dur="6.24">of major event and who knows there could</text>

  <text start="851.99" dur="3.63">maybe this time they won&amp;#39;t block it but</text>
  <text start="854.12" dur="2.07">it really won&amp;#39;t be from the Houthis will</text>
  <text start="855.62" dur="2.64">come from</text>
  <text start="856.19" dur="5.34">someplace else but again they will blame</text>
  <text start="858.26" dur="5.61">it all on the Houthis or Iran to try to</text>
  <text start="861.53" dur="5.28">start this event or maybe something will</text>

  <text start="866.81" dur="5.19">Lebanon and Syria we don&amp;#39;t know as of</text>
  <text start="869.18" dur="4.44">yet we see that the Syrian army they</text>

  <text start="882.56" dur="6.66">whole entire Factory was creating them</text>
  <text start="885.2" dur="5.33">and they have captured it now I wanted</text>
  <text start="889.22" dur="5.19">to talk about what happened down in</text>
  <text start="890.53" dur="7.03">Texas right now we see that Devon</text>
  <text start="894.41" dur="5.55">Patrick Kelly it looks like he went into</text>
  <text start="897.56" dur="6.33">a First Baptist Church in Sutherland</text>
  <text start="899.96" dur="6.63">Springs Texas and allegedly shot up many</text>
  <text start="903.89" dur="4.74">individuals inside and it looks like</text>
  <text start="906.59" dur="2.67">this had to do with a dispute with his</text>
  <text start="908.63" dur="2.91">mother-in-law</text>
  <text start="909.26" dur="4.17">Michelle shields because there&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="911.54" dur="5.57">text messages that would went back and</text>
  <text start="913.43" dur="7.74">forth and we need to understand that the</text>
  <text start="917.11" dur="7.65">pro-gun control people they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="921.17" dur="8.91">this to push their agenda here in this</text>
  <text start="924.76" dur="7.99">again mass type of shooting and again we</text>
  <text start="930.08" dur="5.13">have to understand the weapon doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="932.75" dur="4.8">kill anyone I mean think about this for</text>
  <text start="935.21" dur="5.28">a second in Paris in New York all these</text>
  <text start="937.55" dur="7.65">false flags that they have the car the</text>
  <text start="940.49" dur="6.45">truck who killed eight 15 20 people the</text>
  <text start="945.2" dur="4.32">car truck didn&amp;#39;t do by itself it was the</text>
  <text start="946.94" dur="6">driver but they never say that when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="949.52" dur="5.79">a weapons type of shooting it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="952.94" dur="4.65">the gun but when we look back at this</text>
  <text start="955.31" dur="5.31">person it looks like he has some type of</text>
  <text start="957.59" dur="4.98">history here and as it turns out Kelly</text>
  <text start="960.62" dur="4.29">was court-martialed in 2012 for two</text>
  <text start="962.57" dur="4.65">counts of article 128 of the Uniform</text>

  <text start="983.24" dur="6.03">meds from sixth to ninth grade and most</text>
  <text start="986.42" dur="3.54">likely I&amp;#39;m saying this probably was the</text>
  <text start="989.27" dur="1.83">same</text>
  <text start="989.96" dur="3.3">the thing that we&amp;#39;ve seen in the past</text>
  <text start="991.1" dur="5.58">where he was on top some type of SSRI</text>

  <text start="996.68" dur="3.57">of mentally ill</text>
  <text start="997.64" dur="5.04">mental illness and maybe he went off of</text>
  <text start="1000.25" dur="3.69">it and we know for a fact when people go</text>
  <text start="1002.68" dur="3.3">off of these type of drugs they hear</text>
  <text start="1003.94" dur="3.9">voices in their head and they go out and</text>
  <text start="1005.98" dur="4.79">they try to kill people but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1007.84" dur="5.34">interesting about all of this is that</text>
  <text start="1010.77" dur="6.04">inside the church there was an armed</text>
  <text start="1013.18" dur="5.22">person who started firing back at this</text>
  <text start="1016.81" dur="3.48">individual and saying if this person</text>
  <text start="1018.4" dur="5.34">wasn&amp;#39;t there a lot more people might</text>
  <text start="1020.29" dur="5.13">have died and once again Trump is out</text>
  <text start="1023.74" dur="3.51">there saying listen this has nothing to</text>
  <text start="1025.42" dur="4.71">do with the gun this has to do with a</text>
  <text start="1027.25" dur="5.22">mental health problem and I think what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1030.13" dur="4.38">going to happen at this point as we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1032.47" dur="3.39">continually pushing the idea that we</text>
  <text start="1034.51" dur="3.27">need to look into these people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1035.86" dur="4.74">backgrounds and what are most of these</text>
  <text start="1037.78" dur="4.92">people on some type of SSRI drug and</text>
  <text start="1040.6" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;ve gone in the past and looked at all</text>
  <text start="1042.7" dur="4.02">the different mass shootings and I would</text>
  <text start="1044.56" dur="4.65">say the majority of them like 98 percent</text>
  <text start="1046.72" dur="4.74">of them they had some type of mental</text>
  <text start="1049.21" dur="6">health problem we discussed that before</text>
  <text start="1051.46" dur="5.4">and as this continually comes out we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1055.21" dur="3.81">gonna have to probe into this and I</text>
  <text start="1056.86" dur="3.93">think this gun control agenda is going</text>
  <text start="1059.02" dur="3.48">down the tubes right now because as more</text>
  <text start="1060.79" dur="4.5">and more people come out and say that</text>
  <text start="1062.5" dur="5.25">this is a mental health problem just</text>
  <text start="1065.29" dur="5.1">like when they use the cars or they use</text>
  <text start="1067.75" dur="4.83">knives it&amp;#39;s not the knife it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="1070.39" dur="4.8">car it&amp;#39;s not the truck it&amp;#39;s the person</text>
  <text start="1072.58" dur="6.51">and people say well guns kill a lot more</text>
  <text start="1075.19" dur="6.09">people than knives or cars really well</text>
  <text start="1079.09" dur="5.43">let&amp;#39;s go to Kunming railway station</text>
  <text start="1081.28" dur="5.85">massacre of 2014 as hundreds of Chinese</text>
  <text start="1084.52" dur="4.56">went about their daily commutes a group</text>
  <text start="1087.13" dur="4.11">of four knifeman stormed the station and</text>

  <text start="1091.24" dur="6">memory</text>
  <text start="1092.37" dur="6.43">guess what 29 innocent Chinese were dead</text>
  <text start="1097.24" dur="5.16">and a hundred and thirty more were</text>
  <text start="1098.8" dur="6.35">injured from knives so should we ban the</text>
  <text start="1102.4" dur="6.39">knife or was it these individuals and</text>
  <text start="1105.15" dur="7.66">this is the not the only attack with a</text>
  <text start="1108.79" dur="6.63">knife where the victims numbered 22 or</text>
  <text start="1112.81" dur="5.37">more in an attack think about Paris</text>
  <text start="1115.42" dur="4.74">France or Germany or many of the other</text>
  <text start="1118.18" dur="3.42">countries where people took trucks and</text>
  <text start="1120.16" dur="2.58">rammed into people yes I know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1121.6" dur="2.04">false flags but we&amp;#39;re going to use them</text>
  <text start="1122.74" dur="2.61">to our benefit right</text>
  <text start="1123.64" dur="3.84">now where they rammed in the trucks and</text>
  <text start="1125.35" dur="5.58">they killed many people with these other</text>
  <text start="1127.48" dur="4.74">type of inanimate objects that don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="1130.93" dur="4.08">anything unless there&amp;#39;s a person behind</text>
  <text start="1132.22" dur="4.74">it the same thing with the gun and this</text>
  <text start="1135.01" dur="4.5">is where it&amp;#39;s all falling apart for the</text>
  <text start="1136.96" dur="6.48">gun control group because as we know it</text>
  <text start="1139.51" dur="5.79">is the person if someone drinks and they</text>
  <text start="1143.44" dur="5.58">get into a car and they&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="1145.3" dur="7.65">drunk and they ram into a whole mess of</text>
  <text start="1149.02" dur="6.12">people who&amp;#39;s responsible it&amp;#39;s the person</text>
  <text start="1152.95" dur="5.7">behind the wheel it&amp;#39;s not the car if</text>
  <text start="1155.14" dur="6.09">someone is taking SSRI drugs who has a</text>
  <text start="1158.65" dur="6">mental illness and they get a gun and</text>
  <text start="1161.23" dur="6.72">they start shooting is it the guns fault</text>
  <text start="1164.65" dur="6.63">no it&amp;#39;s the person who has the mental</text>
  <text start="1167.95" dur="5.25">illness because that person if they</text>
  <text start="1171.28" dur="4.38">didn&amp;#39;t have a gun they would have taken</text>
  <text start="1173.2" dur="3.27">the car or a truck and they would have</text>
  <text start="1175.66" dur="2.52">done the same thing</text>
  <text start="1176.47" dur="4.2">or maybe they would have created a bomb</text>
  <text start="1178.18" dur="4.92">they would have done the same thing so</text>
  <text start="1180.67" dur="6.06">we can see right now their gun control</text>
  <text start="1183.1" dur="6.54">problem is not the guns</text>
  <text start="1186.73" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s the people just like the people</text>
  <text start="1189.64" dur="2.85">that was driving the truck just like the</text>
  <text start="1190.99" dur="4.41">people that drive the car she was like</text>
  <text start="1192.49" dur="5.28">the person that was using the knife so</text>
  <text start="1195.4" dur="4.74">that whole thing is falling apart but</text>
  <text start="1197.77" dur="4.62">like we said these events are going to</text>
  <text start="1200.14" dur="4.71">continue on they&amp;#39;re gonna push these</text>
  <text start="1202.39" dur="3.87">individuals and this individual was in</text>
  <text start="1204.85" dur="3.03">contact I&amp;#39;m sure we&amp;#39;re going to come out</text>
  <text start="1206.26" dur="6.69">them and see the FBI was in contact</text>
  <text start="1207.88" dur="8.64">because the entire pattern is always the</text>
  <text start="1212.95" dur="6.6">same where the FBI had talks with this</text>
  <text start="1216.52" dur="4.92">individual and the patterns always</text>
  <text start="1219.55" dur="5.25">seemed the same this person committed</text>
  <text start="1221.44" dur="7.56">suicide it&amp;#39;s always the same pattern</text>
  <text start="1224.8" dur="5.37">over and over and over and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1229" dur="3.15">trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1230.17" dur="4.23">distract everyone from everything and</text>
  <text start="1232.15" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re gonna continually do this over</text>
  <text start="1234.4" dur="4.89">and over and now they have this event</text>
  <text start="1236.71" dur="4.14">building up in the Middle East and we</text>
