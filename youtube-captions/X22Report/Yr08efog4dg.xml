  <text start="57.079" dur="5.761">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.7" dur="7.35">episode 1341 a and today&amp;#39;s date is July</text>
  <text start="62.84" dur="5.52">25th 2017 and the plot of the episode is</text>
  <text start="66.05" dur="4.76">the central banker transition is</text>
  <text start="68.36" dur="4.77">happening quietly in the background</text>
  <text start="70.81" dur="4.69">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="73.13" dur="6.95">financial news now we&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="75.5" dur="6.84">how the central banking system they are</text>
  <text start="80.08" dur="4.48">transitioning everything from the west</text>
  <text start="82.34" dur="4.889">to the east now we discussed this in</text>
  <text start="84.56" dur="5.52">many reports going back a couple of</text>
  <text start="87.229" dur="6.111">years and moving forward we continually</text>
  <text start="90.08" dur="5.64">updated on what is happening here and</text>
  <text start="93.34" dur="4.87">many people are saying no this is not</text>
  <text start="95.72" dur="5.55">happening it&amp;#39;s not moving from west to</text>
  <text start="98.21" dur="5.7">east and we can see that it definitely</text>
  <text start="101.27" dur="4.53">is and we&amp;#39;re going to get into this a</text>
  <text start="103.91" dur="5.04">little bit later in the report on what</text>
  <text start="105.8" dur="7.489">the IMF is actually doing how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="108.95" dur="7.38">teaming up with China to basically</text>
  <text start="113.289" dur="5.291">become the next reserve currency or be</text>
  <text start="116.33" dur="4.17">part of the next reserve currency</text>
  <text start="118.58" dur="3.63">remember the central bankers they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="120.5" dur="2.82">been planning this for quite a while</text>
  <text start="122.21" dur="4.799">they&amp;#39;re very patient</text>
  <text start="123.32" dur="5.579">they don&amp;#39;t rush into things they know</text>
  <text start="127.009" dur="3.991">it&amp;#39;s going to take a number of years to</text>
  <text start="128.899" dur="4.021">transition because they don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="131" dur="3.959">care they&amp;#39;re making a lot of money</text>
  <text start="132.92" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re building their wealth most of</text>
  <text start="134.959" dur="3.991">them don&amp;#39;t even pay taxes and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="137.18" dur="4.77">basically stealing from all the</text>
  <text start="138.95" dur="5.97">countries and acquiring their assets so</text>
  <text start="141.95" dur="5.849">they have plenty of time and they know</text>
  <text start="144.92" dur="4.62">exactly what is happening in the economy</text>
  <text start="147.799" dur="3.72">they know that their system dies here</text>
  <text start="149.54" dur="4.919">they need to start it up over here and</text>
  <text start="151.519" dur="6.211">this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing right</text>
  <text start="154.459" dur="5.34">now and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the entire</text>
  <text start="157.73" dur="4.14">global system I&amp;#39;m not just talking about</text>
  <text start="159.799" dur="5.22">the United States I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="161.87" dur="6.899">entire global system it is imploding on</text>
  <text start="165.019" dur="5.491">itself and many people have been kept in</text>
  <text start="168.769" dur="3.091">the dark believing that everything is</text>
  <text start="170.51" dur="3.18">fine that everything that the corporate</text>
  <text start="171.86" dur="3.15">media everything the Fed everything the</text>
  <text start="173.69" dur="4.92">government&amp;#39;s have been telling us are</text>
  <text start="175.01" dur="6.81">the is the actual truth and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="178.61" dur="6.27">ripping this apart showing that this is</text>
  <text start="181.82" dur="4.23">not the truth now there are reports that</text>
  <text start="184.88" dur="2.37">are coming out here in the U</text>
  <text start="186.05" dur="2.97">West where they&amp;#39;re trying to make us</text>
  <text start="187.25" dur="5.78">believe that you know the economy is</text>
  <text start="189.02" dur="6.18">doing well and the employment arena is</text>
  <text start="193.03" dur="4.63">fantastic now we&amp;#39;ve been looking at this</text>
  <text start="195.2" dur="5.31">we know because many people have already</text>
  <text start="197.66" dur="6.72">suggested this already Dell douve into</text>
  <text start="200.51" dur="6">the calculations of the employment</text>
  <text start="204.38" dur="4.74">numbers and they have shown that these</text>
  <text start="206.51" dur="5.52">employment numbers are completely</text>
  <text start="209.12" dur="5.73">manipulated they had to do this to keep</text>
  <text start="212.03" dur="4.5">the illusion alive and there are a</text>
  <text start="214.85" dur="3.93">couple of states even using this</text>
  <text start="216.53" dur="4.56">manipulated calculation where they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="218.78" dur="3.87">never recovered since the Great</text>
  <text start="221.09" dur="4.08">Recession or the recession before that</text>
  <text start="222.65" dur="5.01">Illinois Alabama Connecticut Michigan</text>
  <text start="225.17" dur="5.55">Mississippi New Mexico Ohio Wyoming</text>
  <text start="227.66" dur="6.39">these are a few of the states that have</text>
  <text start="230.72" dur="5.49">not regained employment that were lost</text>
  <text start="234.05" dur="4.98">during the Great Recession or prior</text>
  <text start="236.21" dur="5.82">recessions they&amp;#39;ve never recovered there</text>
  <text start="239.03" dur="5.51">are many other states that are in the</text>
  <text start="242.03" dur="6.78">same boat and remember this is the</text>
  <text start="244.54" dur="7.03">manipulated numbers can you imagine if</text>
  <text start="248.81" dur="6.179">we stripped away the manipulation how</text>
  <text start="251.57" dur="5.7">many states have never recovered from</text>
  <text start="254.989" dur="5.701">the require from the prior recessions it</text>
  <text start="257.27" dur="6.99">would be an incredible amount now in</text>
  <text start="260.69" dur="6.6">regards to real estate we have just seen</text>
  <text start="264.26" dur="6.15">and witnessed something that I never</text>
  <text start="267.29" dur="5.31">thought was going to happen in the 20</text>
  <text start="270.41" dur="4.35">cities that Case Shiller reports on in</text>
  <text start="272.6" dur="4.2">the 20 cities that the Fed is able to</text>
  <text start="274.76" dur="6.6">manipulate and blow up these bubbles</text>
  <text start="276.8" dur="10.67">they have hit a new record high they</text>
  <text start="281.36" dur="7.44">were able to pass the bubble of 2005</text>
  <text start="287.47" dur="5.41">2006</text>
  <text start="288.8" dur="7.89">so in these 20 cities we have now moved</text>
  <text start="292.88" dur="8.28">past the height of the bubble the</text>
  <text start="296.69" dur="7.77">housing bubble in 2005 2006 now we all</text>
  <text start="301.16" dur="5.25">know how this ended we all know that it</text>
  <text start="304.46" dur="4.05">came crashing down and it just didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="306.41" dur="4.08">effect a certain period of or a certain</text>
  <text start="308.51" dur="4.909">area it affected the entire country</text>
  <text start="310.49" dur="6.299">actually in affected the entire world</text>
  <text start="313.419" dur="6.521">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that they</text>
  <text start="316.789" dur="5.611">have pumped the bubble up so high in</text>
  <text start="319.94" dur="4.53">20 cities to make everyone believe that</text>
  <text start="322.4" dur="3.63">the housing market is fine and if you go</text>
  <text start="324.47" dur="3.27">outside of these 20 cities and a lot of</text>
  <text start="326.03" dur="3.69">people are writing it to me saying that</text>
  <text start="327.74" dur="4.32">yeah the housing market is taking a dive</text>
  <text start="329.72" dur="3.9">people have homes for sale they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="332.06" dur="3.06">on the market a very long time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="333.62" dur="3.45">continually lowering the prices and</text>
  <text start="335.12" dur="3.45">there are more and more houses going up</text>
  <text start="337.07" dur="3.66">for sale thinking that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="338.57" dur="4.02">you know get a incredible return on</text>
  <text start="340.73" dur="4.29">their homes now a lot of people who have</text>
  <text start="342.59" dur="5.01">their homes up for sale they bought at</text>
  <text start="345.02" dur="7.92">the height of the market back in 2006</text>
  <text start="347.6" dur="8.97">2005 2006 - timeframe and they have</text>
  <text start="352.94" dur="5.73">never recouped on paper of course what</text>
  <text start="356.57" dur="4.41">they paid for that home so if they went</text>
  <text start="358.67" dur="5.52">out and they sold the home right now it</text>
  <text start="360.98" dur="5.94">would be at a loss except if you&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="364.19" dur="4.68">those 20 cities if you&amp;#39;re outside of</text>
  <text start="366.92" dur="5.78">those 20 cities guess what and I know</text>
  <text start="368.87" dur="6.63">many people who paid a premium during</text>
  <text start="372.7" dur="5.89">2005-2006 and they&amp;#39;re still well below</text>
  <text start="375.5" dur="5.79">what they paid and it&amp;#39;s only going to</text>
  <text start="378.59" dur="4.8">get worse now the Fed they are very</text>
  <text start="381.29" dur="4.89">worried about the commercial real estate</text>
  <text start="383.39" dur="5.13">market and they&amp;#39;re worried about the</text>
  <text start="386.18" dur="4.98">stability of the market because what</text>
  <text start="388.52" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="391.16" dur="5.37">number of apartments that are being</text>
  <text start="392.96" dur="9.54">built right now well they&amp;#39;re at record</text>
  <text start="396.53" dur="9.12">highs compared to 2005 2006 2007 so</text>
  <text start="402.5" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;re passing that time period now the</text>
  <text start="405.65" dur="3.45">u.s. is going to set this new record</text>
  <text start="407.36" dur="3.63">high of three hundred and forty six</text>
  <text start="409.1" dur="5.069">thousand new rental apartments in</text>
  <text start="410.99" dur="6.08">buildings with 50-plus units and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="414.169" dur="6.841">expected to hit the market and</text>
  <text start="417.07" dur="7.83">deliveries in 2017 they are 21 percent</text>
  <text start="421.01" dur="7.44">above the prior record set in 2016 and</text>
  <text start="424.9" dur="6.73">if we go back to 1997 guess what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="428.45" dur="5.969">above that time period because back in</text>
  <text start="431.63" dur="6.57">those periods it was much lower so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="434.419" dur="6.781">about 63 percent higher than the</text>
  <text start="438.2" dur="5.67">previous record now these numbers don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="441.2" dur="4.62">include condos condos are purchased by</text>
  <text start="443.87" dur="3.69">investors sometimes they show up in</text>
  <text start="445.82" dur="3.93">rental markets but they&amp;#39;re not included</text>
  <text start="447.56" dur="4.46">and remember these are units that are 50</text>
  <text start="449.75" dur="4.46">units or above</text>
  <text start="452.02" dur="3.75">there&amp;#39;s just been a boom in their</text>
  <text start="454.21" dur="5.79">commercial real estate market now</text>
  <text start="455.77" dur="5.81">remember a lot of these apartments they</text>
  <text start="460" dur="3.78">are highly leveraged</text>
  <text start="461.58" dur="4.12">government-sponsored enterprises such as</text>
  <text start="463.78" dur="3.33">Fannie Mae they guarantee the commercial</text>
  <text start="465.7" dur="3.3">mortgages on apartment buildings and</text>
  <text start="467.11" dur="4.14">they package them in commercial</text>
  <text start="469" dur="3.12">mortgage-backed securities sound</text>
  <text start="471.25" dur="3.93">familiar</text>
  <text start="472.12" dur="4.65">so really the taxpayers will be on the</text>
  <text start="475.18" dur="2.16">hook when all this completely falls</text>
  <text start="476.77" dur="5.49">apart</text>
  <text start="477.34" dur="7.89">now we also see that smaller banks they</text>
  <text start="482.26" dur="5.7">are going to be on the hook and the Fed</text>
  <text start="485.23" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re very worried about the smaller</text>
  <text start="487.96" dur="4.32">banks because once this starts to go and</text>
  <text start="491.17" dur="2.7">we know the smaller banks are</text>
  <text start="492.28" dur="4.14">interconnected with the larger banks</text>
  <text start="493.87" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s going to be a cascading effect and</text>
  <text start="496.42" dur="5.39">these smaller banks are heavily exposed</text>
  <text start="499.18" dur="6.09">to these commercial real estate loans as</text>
  <text start="501.81" dur="6.7">these as the collateral values of these</text>
  <text start="505.27" dur="5.88">commercial real estate buildings they</text>
  <text start="508.51" dur="4.02">are dropping in value right now and the</text>
  <text start="511.15" dur="3.09">Fed is very worried about this now</text>
  <text start="512.53" dur="3.33">remember there are so many things going</text>
  <text start="514.24" dur="4.38">on in this economy so many things the</text>
  <text start="515.86" dur="4.8">Fed needs to keep a check on because</text>
  <text start="518.62" dur="4.98">remember they built this illusion and</text>
  <text start="520.66" dur="6">one small move brings it down without</text>
  <text start="523.6" dur="4.65">them controlling it and there is a new</text>
  <text start="526.66" dur="4.05">supply of apartment units that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="528.25" dur="5.34">to hit the market in 2018 and 2019 and</text>
  <text start="530.71" dur="5.18">the number of apartments is going to be</text>
  <text start="533.59" dur="5.55">even larger than what we have now and</text>
  <text start="535.89" dur="5.92">it&amp;#39;s going to be a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="539.14" dur="5.25">and we&amp;#39;re already seeing the commercial</text>
  <text start="541.81" dur="4.74">property price index well it&amp;#39;s starting</text>
  <text start="544.39" dur="5.51">to fall now when did we see this once</text>
  <text start="546.55" dur="7.77">before well we saw it in September of</text>
  <text start="549.9" dur="7.63">2007 the index hit a hundred then it</text>
  <text start="554.32" dur="6.9">started to turn downward and it kept</text>
  <text start="557.53" dur="5.79">going it reached its peak and it fell by</text>
  <text start="561.22" dur="5.91">May 2009 all the way down to sixty one</text>
  <text start="563.32" dur="5.73">point two we have hit the peak at one</text>
  <text start="567.13" dur="5.4">hundred and twenty five point five in</text>
  <text start="569.05" dur="7.08">June of 2016 and it started to decline</text>
  <text start="572.53" dur="7.8">at the end of 2016 here we are in the</text>
  <text start="576.13" dur="6.66">middle of 2017 and it is falling very</text>
  <text start="580.33" dur="5.49">very quickly now we&amp;#39;ve already hit the</text>
  <text start="582.79" dur="6.63">point where everything started to</text>
  <text start="585.82" dur="8.19">slow back in June of 2016 and we are now</text>
  <text start="589.42" dur="6.3">hitting that point as we decline so when</text>
  <text start="594.01" dur="4.64">we look at this we can see we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="595.72" dur="6.03">repeating what happened in September of</text>
  <text start="598.65" dur="5.94">2007 this is why the Fed is so worried</text>
  <text start="601.75" dur="6.57">about this because the real economy is</text>
  <text start="604.59" dur="6.31">slowing dramatically and they understand</text>
  <text start="608.32" dur="5.13">this that the entire system is getting</text>
  <text start="610.9" dur="5.13">ready to implode now Trump is out there</text>
  <text start="613.45" dur="4.98">and once again he is setting up trade</text>
  <text start="616.03" dur="4.49">deals now we are going to need these</text>
  <text start="618.43" dur="3.9">trade deals because when the economy</text>
  <text start="620.52" dur="4.36">implodes we need to bring back</text>
  <text start="622.33" dur="5.34">manufacturing we need to establish real</text>
  <text start="624.88" dur="5.43">trade not other countries purchasing the</text>
  <text start="627.67" dur="4.14">Treasuries or holding the dollars and</text>
  <text start="630.31" dur="4.14">things like that we need to actually</text>
  <text start="631.81" dur="5.4">produce something and trade with other</text>
  <text start="634.45" dur="5.94">countries and right now he&amp;#39;s working on</text>
  <text start="637.21" dur="5.88">a trade deal with the UK and we can see</text>
  <text start="640.39" dur="4.53">right now Nigel Farage the former</text>
  <text start="643.09" dur="3.51">YouTube leader tweeted that Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="644.92" dur="4.56">announcement shows there&amp;#39;s a big world</text>
  <text start="646.6" dur="4.68">for the UK outside of the EU now</text>
  <text start="649.48" dur="5.76">remember these trade deals will not be</text>
  <text start="651.28" dur="7.74">enforced until Britain leaves the EU and</text>
  <text start="655.24" dur="6.18">has the official brexit but they can</text>
  <text start="659.02" dur="4.95">negotiate right now and it looks like</text>
  <text start="661.42" dur="4.65">this is what is happening and we can see</text>
  <text start="663.97" dur="4.35">that he&amp;#39;s trying to establish trade</text>
  <text start="666.07" dur="4.8">deals bringing back bring bringing back</text>
  <text start="668.32" dur="5.34">manufacturing this is a very difficult</text>
  <text start="670.87" dur="6.18">task because we need to remember the</text>
  <text start="673.66" dur="7.02">globalists the deep state has been</text>
  <text start="677.05" dur="6.87">setting their globalist agenda up for</text>
  <text start="680.68" dur="6.75">many many years and now it has to be</text>
  <text start="683.92" dur="6.75">unwound before the entire system</text>
  <text start="687.43" dur="6.15">collapses or as the system collapses</text>
  <text start="690.67" dur="6.45">trying to rebuild the entire system and</text>
  <text start="693.58" dur="6.9">this is not an easy feat now the central</text>
  <text start="697.12" dur="4.41">bankers they still want control and we</text>
  <text start="700.48" dur="3.81">said this many times before</text>
  <text start="701.53" dur="4.8">they still want control of the system</text>
  <text start="704.29" dur="4.23">now I know there&amp;#39;s the birth of the</text>
  <text start="706.33" dur="3.21">crypto currencies we know that goldman</text>
  <text start="708.52" dur="2.46">sachs they&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="709.54" dur="3.6">cryptocurrencies and looking at the</text>
  <text start="710.98" dur="4.05">blockchain technology to handle some</text>
  <text start="713.14" dur="4.2">type of trading system they already</text>
  <text start="715.03" dur="3.83">patented that they want to make sure</text>
  <text start="717.34" dur="3.89">that they&amp;#39;re in control</text>
  <text start="718.86" dur="3.78">of that we know the central banks and</text>
  <text start="721.23" dur="2.88">other central banks around the world</text>
  <text start="722.64" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re looking at the blockchain</text>
  <text start="724.11" dur="4.05">technology not to be free and open to</text>
  <text start="726.06" dur="4.53">the people but to use it to their</text>
  <text start="728.16" dur="5.04">benefit now the Federal Reserve on</text>
  <text start="730.59" dur="5.04">Monday said they want payments and money</text>
  <text start="733.2" dur="4.74">transfers well they want them to be</text>
  <text start="735.63" dur="4.41">real-time and if you notice what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="737.94" dur="4.92">talking about is they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="740.04" dur="6.36">their system robust and they want it to</text>
  <text start="742.86" dur="5.94">compete with whatever crypto system is</text>
  <text start="746.4" dur="4.14">that they now remember they might use</text>
  <text start="748.8" dur="5.78">the blockchain but they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="750.54" dur="8.94">develop a uniform payment system that</text>
  <text start="754.58" dur="7.41">will work in real time and this is for</text>
  <text start="759.48" dur="4.86">the future they want very fast</text>
  <text start="761.99" dur="4.8">transactions they want no paper</text>
  <text start="764.34" dur="6.03">whatsoever they want everything</text>
  <text start="766.79" dur="5.44">electronic now we have to remember the</text>
  <text start="770.37" dur="3.96">crypto currency market the open free</text>
  <text start="772.23" dur="5.22">market where the people will control</text>
  <text start="774.33" dur="6.33">this compared to the central bank&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="777.45" dur="5.55">is also a very quick and fast type of</text>
  <text start="780.66" dur="5.58">system where there is no paperwork but</text>
  <text start="783" dur="4.98">there is a trail to show who has done</text>
  <text start="786.24" dur="3.54">what transaction and you can go back in</text>
  <text start="787.98" dur="5.7">time to make sure that everything adds</text>
  <text start="789.78" dur="5.25">up the Federal Reserve System well they</text>
  <text start="793.68" dur="4.05">want a system where they can manipulate</text>
  <text start="795.03" dur="5.55">this is the difference this is the fight</text>
  <text start="797.73" dur="6.6">that is going to go on in the future now</text>
  <text start="800.58" dur="6.81">we talked about how the IMF how China</text>
  <text start="804.33" dur="5.28">and remember we need to put this in</text>
  <text start="807.39" dur="4.71">perspective the United States has lost</text>
  <text start="809.61" dur="4.47">their manufacturing a lot of the</text>
  <text start="812.1" dur="5.1">manufacturing has gone over to China</text>
  <text start="814.08" dur="4.41">China is a manufacturing powerhouse and</text>
  <text start="817.2" dur="3.54">a lot of people are out there saying</text>
  <text start="818.49" dur="6.06">well trying to make scrap well remember</text>
  <text start="820.74" dur="5.34">the corporations dictate what China</text>
  <text start="824.55" dur="4.17">should do all the different</text>
  <text start="826.08" dur="4.65">manufacturing plants how they should</text>
  <text start="828.72" dur="2.85">create the products the corporation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="830.73" dur="3.3">here in the United States</text>
  <text start="831.57" dur="3.87">give them the specifications they tell</text>
  <text start="834.03" dur="3.87">them this is the material this is the</text>
  <text start="835.44" dur="4.53">cost and they produce what the</text>
  <text start="837.9" dur="3.56">corporation&amp;#39;s tell them to produce they</text>
  <text start="839.97" dur="4.65">can produce anything</text>
  <text start="841.46" dur="7.36">now remember manufacturing has been</text>
  <text start="844.62" dur="6.75">moved from the US over to China now</text>
  <text start="848.82" dur="3.96">going back to World War two the United</text>
  <text start="851.37" dur="3.33">States was a</text>
  <text start="852.78" dur="4.35">empowerhouse we became the reserve</text>
  <text start="854.7" dur="4.05">currency everything has been moved now</text>
  <text start="857.13" dur="4.08">remember China and Russia they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="858.75" dur="4.83">developed a system which rivals the</text>
  <text start="861.21" dur="6.12">Swift they&amp;#39;ve developed the shanghai</text>
  <text start="863.58" dur="6.75">gold exchange they&amp;#39;ve developed a stock</text>
  <text start="867.33" dur="6.12">market type of system which emulates the</text>
  <text start="870.33" dur="6.27">West they&amp;#39;ve been doing this and</text>
  <text start="873.45" dur="6.23">preparing for this for quite a while now</text>
  <text start="876.6" dur="6.21">the IMF Director Christine Lagarde</text>
  <text start="879.68" dur="6.78">admitted during an event in Washington</text>
  <text start="882.81" dur="6.78">that the IMF could be based in Beijing</text>
  <text start="886.46" dur="4.72">within a decade now I&amp;#39;m going to tell</text>
  <text start="889.59" dur="3.39">you right now this means they&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="891.18" dur="4.98">a lot faster than they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="892.98" dur="5.1">everyone because as we can see things</text>
  <text start="896.16" dur="4.95">are really moving forward very very</text>
  <text start="898.08" dur="5.91">quickly and the guard said that such a</text>
  <text start="901.11" dur="4.92">move was a possibility because the fund</text>
  <text start="903.99" dur="4.05">will need to increase the representation</text>
  <text start="906.03" dur="3.99">of major emerging markets as their</text>
  <text start="908.04" dur="4.68">economies grow larger and more</text>
  <text start="910.02" dur="8.16">influential right now as we know the</text>
  <text start="912.72" dur="8.7">u.s. holds the voting power but what we</text>
  <text start="918.18" dur="6.33">see is this is slowly switching over to</text>
  <text start="921.42" dur="5.55">the emerging markets and China and again</text>
  <text start="924.51" dur="4.26">China has the Silk Road a lot of</text>
  <text start="926.97" dur="4.56">countries are joining up to this and</text>
  <text start="928.77" dur="6.3">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="931.53" dur="9.06">things are changing very very quickly</text>
  <text start="935.07" dur="9.09">and each sian system only lasts for a</text>
  <text start="940.59" dur="5.34">certain period of time and remember the</text>
  <text start="944.16" dur="5.01">latest one in the United States was</text>
  <text start="945.93" dur="5.4">started in the 70s and here we are 40</text>
  <text start="949.17" dur="4.59">years later and if we go back in time we</text>
  <text start="951.33" dur="5.19">can see that many countries have held</text>
  <text start="953.76" dur="5.97">the reserve currency and if we look back</text>
  <text start="956.52" dur="6.39">in time we can see that the Portuguese</text>
  <text start="959.73" dur="6.96">at one time had the reserve currency we</text>
  <text start="962.91" dur="7.71">can see the Dutch had the ability we see</text>
  <text start="966.69" dur="7.26">the French the British we see the u.s.</text>
  <text start="970.62" dur="6.27">now and we&amp;#39;re on to the next phase</text>
  <text start="973.95" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;ve been preparing for this for a</text>
  <text start="976.89" dur="4.17">very long time now of course everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="979.23" dur="3.9">not out there broadcasting that this is</text>
  <text start="981.06" dur="4.44">happening because it happens behind the</text>
  <text start="983.13" dur="2.94">scenes they really don&amp;#39;t want people to</text>
  <text start="985.5" dur="3.06">know and</text>
  <text start="986.07" dur="4.08">for them they don&amp;#39;t care if people know</text>
  <text start="988.56" dur="3.42">and it&amp;#39;s really none of their business</text>
  <text start="990.15" dur="3.3">because these central bankers they have</text>
  <text start="991.98" dur="3.75">no allegiance to the people they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="993.45" dur="4.08">they think of the people as serfs as</text>
  <text start="995.73" dur="4.56">long as they can control the money</text>
  <text start="997.53" dur="4.38">supply and control it for every single</text>
  <text start="1000.29" dur="3.75">country and the world this is what they</text>
  <text start="1001.91" dur="4.23">really wanted they don&amp;#39;t care they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1004.04" dur="3.78">care if they&amp;#39;re based in China or if</text>
  <text start="1006.14" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re based in Russia or if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1007.82" dur="5.43">based in the United States or the UK</text>
  <text start="1009.74" dur="6.51">they could care less as long as they</text>
  <text start="1013.25" dur="6.15">have control and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1016.25" dur="5.52">this has been the plan from the</text>
  <text start="1019.4" dur="5.67">beginning and we can see already the</text>
  <text start="1021.77" dur="6.42">move is already on they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="1025.07" dur="6.36">making preparations to move to where the</text>
  <text start="1028.19" dur="5.16">next reserve currents or however they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1031.43" dur="3.93">going to formulate this having the SDR</text>
  <text start="1033.35" dur="3.989">sit on top and every country have a</text>
  <text start="1035.36" dur="3.81">local currency I mean I think this is</text>
  <text start="1037.339" dur="3.991">one of their main plans maybe each</text>
  <text start="1039.17" dur="4.77">country will have a cryptocurrency but</text>
  <text start="1041.33" dur="4.68">governments and corporations they will</text>
  <text start="1043.94" dur="4.35">trade in the SDR this is they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1046.01" dur="4.98">their plan for quite a while and what</text>
  <text start="1048.29" dur="5.19">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this is the</text>
  <text start="1050.99" dur="4.11">major plan now we know that the economy</text>
  <text start="1053.48" dur="4.53">here in the United States is completely</text>
  <text start="1055.1" dur="6.75">falling apart and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="1058.01" dur="6.81">Fed the powers that be they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1061.85" dur="5.4">want to blame someone or have some type</text>
  <text start="1064.82" dur="5.49">of an event to make this shift we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1067.25" dur="5.49">already starting to see signs that this</text>
  <text start="1070.31" dur="3.78">is happening now we talked about this</text>
  <text start="1072.74" dur="3.03">before and remember the International</text>
  <text start="1074.09" dur="4.35">Monetary Fund came out and revised the</text>
  <text start="1075.77" dur="5.97">US economic growth the global growth and</text>
  <text start="1078.44" dur="5.13">they brought that down coming out of the</text>
  <text start="1081.74" dur="3.96">corporate media now they&amp;#39;re saying the</text>
  <text start="1083.57" dur="4.98">reason for this the reason why the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1085.7" dur="5.43">got downgraded well it&amp;#39;s a direct</text>
  <text start="1088.55" dur="4.65">indictment of Trump&amp;#39;s ineffectiveness</text>
  <text start="1091.13" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re saying because of his economic</text>
  <text start="1093.2" dur="4.71">agenda he wasn&amp;#39;t able to push certain</text>
  <text start="1095.45" dur="5.4">laws through so he&amp;#39;s really to blame for</text>
  <text start="1097.91" dur="5.37">this and we&amp;#39;re already starting to see</text>
  <text start="1100.85" dur="4.89">the signs of the blame game remember</text>
  <text start="1103.28" dur="4.59">central bank&amp;#39;s never want to take the</text>
  <text start="1105.74" dur="3.51">blame they&amp;#39;ll have some type of an event</text>
  <text start="1107.87" dur="2.85">they&amp;#39;ll blame it on the people they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1109.25" dur="3.6">blame it on the president they&amp;#39;ll blame</text>
  <text start="1110.72" dur="3.87">it on anyone else except for themselves</text>
  <text start="1112.85" dur="3.93">and we&amp;#39;re already starting to see this</text>
  <text start="1114.59" dur="4.2">and we can see at this point if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1116.78" dur="2.85">already starting to do this we know that</text>
  <text start="1118.79" dur="2.85">this is the</text>
  <text start="1119.63" dur="3.69">is about to come down they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="1121.64" dur="3.54">talking about how great the economy is</text>
  <text start="1123.32" dur="4.56">anymore though already pointing the</text>
  <text start="1125.18" dur="4.5">finger and saying yes this is the person</text>
  <text start="1127.88" dur="3.24">who&amp;#39;s going to be responsible for the</text>
  <text start="1129.68" dur="4.08">economy coming down and we know the</text>
  <text start="1131.12" dur="4.44">economy has been one gigantic illusion</text>
  <text start="1133.76" dur="3.48">this is why be we&amp;#39;ve been tracking it</text>
  <text start="1135.56" dur="3.51">this is why we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all</text>
  <text start="1137.24" dur="3.21">the different numbers and going through</text>
  <text start="1139.07" dur="3.3">them and saying these make no sense</text>
  <text start="1140.45" dur="4.11">whatsoever this is why we&amp;#39;re able to say</text>
  <text start="1142.37" dur="4.17">that retail was going to decline over</text>
  <text start="1144.56" dur="5.12">time back when everyone&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="1146.54" dur="5.82">retail was fine the economy was ok a</text>
  <text start="1149.68" dur="4.87">couple years later we see that we&amp;#39;re in</text>
