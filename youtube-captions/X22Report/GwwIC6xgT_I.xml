  <text start="350.81" dur="6.63">of normalizing the atmosphere of Russia</text>
  <text start="353.479" dur="6.631">us interaction so right now it&amp;#39;s being</text>

  <text start="369.409" dur="4.141">deal there&amp;#39;s no deal I personally do</text>
  <text start="371.599" dur="5.22">think there is some type of deal</text>
  <text start="373.55" dur="5.76">happening in this area and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="376.819" dur="4.051">back and forth and right now turkey has</text>
  <text start="379.31" dur="3.81">announced a new agreement with the US</text>

  <text start="383.12" dur="7.68">Kurdish forces from the area of man</text>
  <text start="386.81" dur="6.99">Beach and this is the first thing that</text>
  <text start="390.8" dur="7.679">is happening here we also hear that</text>
  <text start="393.8" dur="8.7">Assad is out there telling the world</text>
  <text start="398.479" dur="7.44">that he&amp;#39;s going to retake the areas held</text>
  <text start="402.5" dur="7.65">by the us-backed Kurds he wants the</text>
  <text start="405.919" dur="7.74">country back and he&amp;#39;s saying that all</text>
  <text start="410.15" dur="6.63">foreign troops they need to remove at</text>
  <text start="413.659" dur="5.79">this point in time and he said we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="416.78" dur="5.009">going to deal with it using two</text>
  <text start="419.449" dur="3.481">different options the first one we</text>
  <text start="421.789" dur="3.63">started now opening doors for</text>
  <text start="422.93" dur="4.859">negotiations because the majority of the</text>
  <text start="425.419" dur="3.99">SDF are Syrians supposedly they like</text>
  <text start="427.789" dur="3.991">their country they don&amp;#39;t like to be</text>
  <text start="429.409" dur="5.79">puppets to any foreigners and we like to</text>
  <text start="431.78" dur="5.729">have discussions with them if not we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="435.199" dur="4.801">going to resort to liberating those</text>
  <text start="437.509" dur="5.071">areas by force it&amp;#39;s our land it&amp;#39;s our</text>
  <text start="440" dur="4.86">right it&amp;#39;s our duty to liberate it and</text>
  <text start="442.58" dur="4.32">the Americans should leave somehow</text>
  <text start="444.86" dur="3.869">they&amp;#39;re going to leave he added they</text>
  <text start="446.9" dur="4.319">came to Iraq with no legal basis and</text>
  <text start="448.729" dur="4.771">look what happened to them they have to</text>
  <text start="451.219" dur="5.251">learn the lesson</text>
  <text start="453.5" dur="5.76">they want the us out now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="456.47" dur="6.45">talking about how this might be possible</text>
  <text start="459.26" dur="6.78">and Putin put it out there saying listen</text>
  <text start="462.92" dur="6.06">we want all foreign troops out of Syria</text>
  <text start="466.04" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s including Iran and of course Iran</text>
  <text start="468.98" dur="5.28">said no way we&amp;#39;re never gonna leave and</text>
  <text start="470.45" dur="7.5">it would have to be left up to Assad to</text>
  <text start="474.26" dur="7.71">say to Iran why don&amp;#39;t you leave right</text>
  <text start="477.95" dur="8.22">now for the best interests of Syria has</text>
  <text start="481.97" dur="7.71">it happened yet not as of yet but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="486.17" dur="7.62">getting very close because right now the</text>
  <text start="489.68" dur="6.24">US with Russia with Jordan part of the</text>
  <text start="493.79" dur="6.87">discussion that they&amp;#39;re having the</text>
  <text start="495.92" dur="8.36">negotiations is having the u.s. handover</text>
  <text start="500.66" dur="5.91">the AL tamp region handing over the base</text>
  <text start="504.28" dur="5.53">that they create what actually the deep</text>
  <text start="506.57" dur="6.36">state created in Syria and this is on</text>
  <text start="509.81" dur="5.099">the border here and Russia and the US</text>
  <text start="512.93" dur="3.45">are currently negotiating in Jordan over</text>
  <text start="514.909" dur="4.831">a potential deal that would give the</text>
  <text start="516.38" dur="5.31">Syrian army full control of al 10th in</text>
  <text start="519.74" dur="4.59">exchange for their troops and allies</text>
  <text start="521.69" dur="4.74">avoiding a potential conflict and what</text>
  <text start="524.33" dur="5.33">would that mean that would mean that the</text>
  <text start="526.43" dur="7.05">US troops would leave this area and</text>
  <text start="529.66" dur="5.17">Israel is included in this deal and they</text>
  <text start="533.48" dur="3.33">would have assurances from Russia</text>
  <text start="534.83" dur="4.41">regarding the withdrawal of all Iranian</text>
  <text start="536.81" dur="6.529">elements from their border very</text>
  <text start="539.24" dur="8.31">interesting now Assad is thinking about</text>
  <text start="543.339" dur="8.621">limiting Iran&amp;#39;s access to Syria&amp;#39;s south</text>
  <text start="547.55" dur="6.539">to restore territorial integrity because</text>
  <text start="551.96" dur="6.03">Assad said his main goal is to restore</text>
  <text start="554.089" dur="7.051">the integrity of Syria and if Iran&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="557.99" dur="6.39">involvement hinders this goal it also</text>
  <text start="561.14" dur="7.08">contradicts his interests Solid&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="564.38" dur="6.6">interests so we see already that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="568.22" dur="6.03">moving in this direction now there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="570.98" dur="6.89">report out there saying that Iranian</text>
  <text start="574.25" dur="6.72">forces and Lebanese Hezbollah are</text>
  <text start="577.87" dur="8.949">preparing to a draw from the southern</text>
  <text start="580.97" dur="10.859">Syrian governance and Russia</text>
  <text start="586.819" dur="6.091">Jordan and us are overseeing what is</text>
  <text start="591.829" dur="5.31">happening there because they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="592.91" dur="6.929">negotiations and it looks like Putin who</text>
  <text start="597.139" dur="4.23">put it out there that all foreign troops</text>
  <text start="599.839" dur="4.56">should be out of there and I think his</text>
  <text start="601.369" dur="6.06">main purpose was to remove Iran so this</text>
  <text start="604.399" dur="6.87">way Israel the US and the coalition</text>
  <text start="607.429" dur="6.72">forces they will end up moving their</text>
  <text start="611.269" dur="7.32">forces out of the area and we actually</text>
  <text start="614.149" dur="7.05">see this happening right now so the plan</text>
  <text start="618.589" dur="6.27">is in motion right now the pieces are</text>
  <text start="621.199" dur="7.56">falling into place where the troops most</text>
  <text start="624.859" dur="6.63">likely will start to leave Syria because</text>
  <text start="628.759" dur="5.97">once Assad sees the troops leaving I</text>
  <text start="631.489" dur="7.41">mean this is how it needs to work once</text>
  <text start="634.729" dur="7.26">Assad removes the Iranian forces from</text>
  <text start="638.899" dur="5.94">certain areas the coalition forces then</text>
  <text start="641.989" dur="4.861">will start to remove their forces and it</text>
  <text start="644.839" dur="5.04">will look it will go back and forth and</text>
  <text start="646.85" dur="5.129">they&amp;#39;ll come to this agreement that yes</text>
  <text start="649.879" dur="4.11">there&amp;#39;s no reason for the u.s. to stay</text>
  <text start="651.979" dur="7.26">there because the Iranian forces are</text>
  <text start="653.989" dur="7.38">being removed Russia is the body that is</text>
  <text start="659.239" dur="5.43">making sure that this is happening and</text>
  <text start="661.369" dur="6.18">Russia is filling the gap and they will</text>
  <text start="664.669" dur="5.31">take care of these areas and I think</text>
  <text start="667.549" dur="6.65">this is how the US is going to get out</text>
  <text start="669.979" dur="8.36">of this area now Lebanon and Syria</text>
  <text start="674.199" dur="7.42">they&amp;#39;re already making preparations for</text>
  <text start="678.339" dur="5.98">the withdrawal of all foreign troops and</text>
  <text start="681.619" dur="5.61">for this entire war to come to an end</text>
  <text start="684.319" dur="6.51">because Lebanon&amp;#39;s general security chief</text>
  <text start="687.229" dur="5.76">Major General stated that he is speaking</text>
  <text start="690.829" dur="4.8">to the Syrian government they are</text>
  <text start="692.989" dur="5.4">working together right now and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="695.629" dur="6.18">going to begin the repatriation of</text>
  <text start="698.389" dur="5.82">refugees back to their homeland there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="701.809" dur="4.74">about 1.5 million Syrian refugees that</text>
  <text start="704.209" dur="4.8">are currently living inside of Lebanon</text>
  <text start="706.549" dur="8.34">right now and they&amp;#39;re going to return</text>
  <text start="709.009" dur="7.89">back to Syria and they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="714.889" dur="4.441">putting plans together to have this</text>
  <text start="716.899" dur="4.171">happen now once again the</text>
  <text start="719.33" dur="4.439">deep state is not going to like this</text>
  <text start="721.07" dur="5.1">whatsoever because this is undermining</text>
  <text start="723.769" dur="5.13">everything that they were trying to do</text>
  <text start="726.17" dur="4.38">for a very long time and the whole thing</text>
  <text start="728.899" dur="5.101">is backfiring right now</text>
  <text start="730.55" dur="6.479">same thing in Iraq where the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="734" dur="4.23">leaders they want the u.s. out and I</text>
  <text start="737.029" dur="2.821">think what&amp;#39;s going to happen with</text>
  <text start="738.23" dur="5.25">Afghanistan if you start to put all this</text>
  <text start="739.85" dur="6.66">together it&amp;#39;s all being orchestrated so</text>
  <text start="743.48" dur="6.06">the US troops no longer need to be in</text>
  <text start="746.51" dur="6.269">these regions it&amp;#39;s already been worked</text>
  <text start="749.54" dur="3.75">out behind the scenes just like wait</text>
  <text start="752.779" dur="3.451">wait</text>
  <text start="753.29" dur="6.27">North Korea and we see it happening all</text>
  <text start="756.23" dur="5.37">at once and I think this is why November</text>
  <text start="759.56" dur="5.58">11th of this year is going to be so</text>
  <text start="761.6" dur="6.419">important and it looks like the plan is</text>
  <text start="765.14" dur="6.75">moving in this direction now this brings</text>
  <text start="768.019" dur="8.161">me back to what Soros said about needing</text>
  <text start="771.89" dur="7.08">funds from Europe to help the refugees</text>
  <text start="776.18" dur="5.01">in Africa and to bring them up into</text>
  <text start="778.97" dur="3.66">Europe to keep the open borders because</text>
  <text start="781.19" dur="4.32">you have to remember if we go back in</text>
  <text start="782.63" dur="7.17">time Turkey held a lot of the refugees</text>
  <text start="785.51" dur="6.81">from Iraq mostly Syria and other Middle</text>
  <text start="789.8" dur="4.229">Eastern countries and Turkey while they</text>
  <text start="792.32" dur="3.84">were instructed to open the gates and</text>
  <text start="794.029" dur="5.221">let the refugees flow throughout Europe</text>
  <text start="796.16" dur="4.29">the problem now is that the refugees in</text>
  <text start="799.25" dur="3.63">the Middle East they&amp;#39;re all returning</text>
  <text start="800.45" dur="3.99">home they want to return home they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="802.88" dur="4.56">want to leave their countries they want</text>
  <text start="804.44" dur="4.83">to be in their country and you can see</text>
  <text start="807.44" dur="3.959">if they didn&amp;#39;t want to be there they</text>
  <text start="809.27" dur="3.99">would have gone to other places but</text>
  <text start="811.399" dur="3.241">they&amp;#39;re returning home and the reporters</text>
  <text start="813.26" dur="3.329">are there they&amp;#39;re talking to these</text>
  <text start="814.64" dur="3.66">individuals they&amp;#39;re so glad to be home</text>
  <text start="816.589" dur="3.931">they said it was a nightmare when the</text>
  <text start="818.3" dur="4.979">terrorists were in their area when the</text>
  <text start="820.52" dur="4.559">moderate rebels when Al Qaeda when the</text>
  <text start="823.279" dur="4.231">Islamic state were in their area it was</text>
  <text start="825.079" dur="5.311">just a horrible place to live and they</text>
  <text start="827.51" dur="5.329">had to flee so since there are no more</text>
  <text start="830.39" dur="6.96">refugees coming out of the Middle East</text>
  <text start="832.839" dur="6.641">how do they blend the rest of Europe</text>
  <text start="837.35" dur="4.41">well you got to go to different places</text>
  <text start="839.48" dur="4.89">and get the refugees you need to get</text>
  <text start="841.76" dur="4.8">people shipped up there and I think this</text>
  <text start="844.37" dur="6.18">is what he&amp;#39;s trying to do because their</text>
  <text start="846.56" dur="6.66">plan is not working it is all falling</text>
  <text start="850.55" dur="4.529">apart right now</text>
  <text start="853.22" dur="4.559">and they don&amp;#39;t know what to do at this</text>
  <text start="855.079" dur="5.581">point and this is why most likely</text>
  <text start="857.779" dur="5.761">there&amp;#39;s talks about North Korea cyber</text>
  <text start="860.66" dur="4.799">attacking the financial institutions we</text>
  <text start="863.54" dur="3.989">know there&amp;#39;s a huge push and I think</text>
  <text start="865.459" dur="3.841">this is the time and the reason why</text>
  <text start="867.529" dur="4.441">they&amp;#39;re pushing at this time is that</text>
  <text start="869.3" dur="4.829">they have pretty much almost everything</text>
  <text start="871.97" dur="3.599">under control yes there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="874.129" dur="3.9">things happening in the corporate media</text>
  <text start="875.569" dur="5.551">because all they know how to do is stir</text>
  <text start="878.029" dur="4.62">emotion use different words like racists</text>
  <text start="881.12" dur="4.199">and things like that and they need to</text>
  <text start="882.649" dur="4.651">keep this continually playing over and</text>
  <text start="885.319" dur="2.82">over and over and over because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="887.3" dur="3.719">all they have</text>
  <text start="888.139" dur="6.211">they don&amp;#39;t have anything real to say so</text>
  <text start="891.019" dur="4.531">they have to create these things and put</text>
  <text start="894.35" dur="3.15">it out there and get everyone</text>
  <text start="895.55" dur="5.519">emotionally charged this is what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="897.5" dur="6.12">done for a very long time but the real</text>
  <text start="901.069" dur="6.481">news is that everything is falling apart</text>
  <text start="903.62" dur="6.089">for them in the background and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="907.55" dur="3.959">not gonna let onto this like oh Syria</text>
  <text start="909.709" dur="3.06">the war is ending there there&amp;#39;s peace</text>
  <text start="911.509" dur="3.991">and what they don&amp;#39;t want to hear that</text>
  <text start="912.769" dur="7.11">they they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen at</text>
  <text start="915.5" dur="7.11">all so most likely with this Inspector</text>
  <text start="919.879" dur="4.26">General&amp;#39;s report coming out with what is</text>
  <text start="922.61" dur="3.149">happening out in the Middle East what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="924.139" dur="4.32">happening out in Afghanistan what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="925.759" dur="5.64">happening with North Korea well they</text>
  <text start="928.459" dur="6.721">might try something big they might push</text>
  <text start="931.399" dur="7.62">an event and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if</text>
  <text start="935.18" dur="5.37">it happens pretty soon and we also need</text>
  <text start="939.019" dur="3.75">to understand is that the Pentagon is</text>
  <text start="940.55" dur="4.079">out there saying they have no evidence</text>
  <text start="942.769" dur="3.69">of any more chemical attacks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="944.629" dur="4.291">putting it all out there to let everyone</text>
  <text start="946.459" dur="3.87">know there&amp;#39;s no problems in Syria and</text>
  <text start="948.92" dur="4.969">there&amp;#39;s no reason for the u.s. to be in</text>
  <text start="950.329" dur="6.391">there and they&amp;#39;re continually doing this</text>
  <text start="953.889" dur="4.211">because they want to pull the troops out</text>
  <text start="956.72" dur="3.239">this was the plan from the beginning</text>
  <text start="958.1" dur="3.029">this is why Trump mentioned this from</text>
  <text start="959.959" dur="2.61">the beginning when I talk about Trump</text>
  <text start="961.129" dur="2.94">I&amp;#39;m not just talking about him as an</text>
  <text start="962.569" dur="3.99">individual I&amp;#39;m talking about all the</text>
  <text start="964.069" dur="4.801">Patriots that are working to make this</text>
  <text start="966.559" dur="5.97">all happen it&amp;#39;s nice it&amp;#39;s not just one</text>
  <text start="968.87" dur="7.5">person and all of this is happening at</text>
  <text start="972.529" dur="6.18">the same time so we can expect more to</text>
  <text start="976.37" dur="3.659">happen we can expect to see a lot more</text>
  <text start="978.709" dur="3.87">but if you look at the corporate media</text>
  <text start="980.029" dur="4.321">you&amp;#39;re not gonna see any of this and I</text>
  <text start="982.579" dur="4.381">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised in the next couple</text>
  <text start="984.35" dur="6.53">of weeks we see the Al</text>
  <text start="986.96" dur="7.86">Tamm face handed over to Syria the</text>
  <text start="990.88" dur="6.37">Iranian forces are pushed back Israel is</text>
  <text start="994.82" dur="4.17">happy with that the US says there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="997.25" dur="4.13">longer to have troops in the border</text>
  <text start="998.99" dur="4.89">areas they remove part of the troops</text>
  <text start="1001.38" dur="4.9">unless the deep state comes along and</text>
  <text start="1003.88" dur="3.84">does something to mess this all up like</text>
  <text start="1006.28" dur="4.2">they tried with North Korea many many</text>
  <text start="1007.72" dur="5.07">times it didn&amp;#39;t work they might try</text>
  <text start="1010.48" dur="5.16">something in Syria just like they tried</text>
  <text start="1012.79" dur="6.27">a chemical attack to try to get a war</text>
  <text start="1015.64" dur="7.25">going on but again they were outsmarted</text>
  <text start="1019.06" dur="6.3">and it went absolutely nowhere so</text>
  <text start="1022.89" dur="4.66">everyone should be on their toes because</text>
  <text start="1025.36" dur="3.93">I do believe the deep state they will</text>
  <text start="1027.55" dur="4.47">try something because there&amp;#39;s gonna be a</text>
  <text start="1029.29" dur="4.35">lot of news coming out and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1032.02" dur="3.27">to need a distraction</text>
