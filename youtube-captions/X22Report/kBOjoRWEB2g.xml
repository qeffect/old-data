  <text start="169.94" dur="4.44">states where they made donald trump win</text>
  <text start="172.25" dur="4.739">and what is really saying right now is</text>
  <text start="174.38" dur="7.289">that they&amp;#39;re very worried that the</text>
  <text start="176.989" dur="4.931">people are going to vote for others to</text>
  <text start="181.669" dur="2.351">be</text>
  <text start="181.92" dur="8.31">in power and this is what they&amp;#39;re most</text>
  <text start="184.02" dur="9.9">afraid of because they realize that time</text>
  <text start="190.23" dur="5.729">is ticking down and they might not be in</text>
  <text start="193.92" dur="5.069">power anymore so what they do is they</text>
  <text start="195.959" dur="5.371">use the fear-mongering of the economy is</text>
  <text start="198.989" dur="4.741">going to implode if we&amp;#39;re not there to</text>
  <text start="201.33" dur="4.739">protect it well the economy is going to</text>
  <text start="203.73" dur="4.17">implode anyhow but just because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="206.069" dur="4.111">not in power it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="207.9" dur="5.82">everything is going to fall apart it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="210.18" dur="5.66">scare tactic but we can see throughout</text>
  <text start="213.72" dur="5.22">Europe and throughout the United States</text>
  <text start="215.84" dur="4.72">the economies aren&amp;#39;t imploding and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="218.94" dur="3.299">because of them it&amp;#39;s because of the</text>
  <text start="220.56" dur="5.1">central bank&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s because of their</text>
  <text start="222.239" dur="8.161">policies but they don&amp;#39;t want to admit</text>
  <text start="225.66" dur="8.13">that here in the United States we see</text>
  <text start="230.4" dur="6">that the United States has lost 286,000</text>
  <text start="233.79" dur="4.59">manufacturing jobs during the time</text>
  <text start="236.4" dur="3.6">President Obama has been in office and</text>
  <text start="238.38" dur="6.03">this is coming from the bureau of labor</text>
  <text start="240" dur="7.53">statistics and at the same time the</text>
  <text start="244.41" dur="6.68">united states gained 3.2 million jobs in</text>
  <text start="247.53" dur="6.06">retail food services and drinking places</text>
  <text start="251.09" dur="5.35">now remember manufacturing jobs they</text>
  <text start="253.59" dur="5.85">were the high paying jobs and according</text>
  <text start="256.44" dur="4.289">to BLS the early earning raised wage was</text>
  <text start="259.44" dur="4.289">around twenty six dollars and</text>
  <text start="260.729" dur="4.891">thirty-seven cents compared to a food</text>
  <text start="263.729" dur="4.351">service or drink place worker which was</text>
  <text start="265.62" dur="5.609">making about thirteen dollars and sixty</text>
  <text start="268.08" dur="6.209">cents an hour and what we see from that</text>
  <text start="271.229" dur="5.551">is that the manufacturing workers were</text>
  <text start="274.289" dur="3.991">making ninety-four percent more than</text>
  <text start="276.78" dur="4.5">those workers that worked in the food</text>
  <text start="278.28" dur="6.09">services and drinking places and this is</text>
  <text start="281.28" dur="5.25">what our economy has turned into where</text>
  <text start="284.37" dur="4.32">people are making less money less</text>
  <text start="286.53" dur="4.639">revenue coming into the government we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="288.69" dur="5.4">losing high-paying jobs now</text>
  <text start="291.169" dur="6.941">manufacturing jobs were at their peak at</text>
  <text start="294.09" dur="9.06">nineteen point five million in June of</text>
  <text start="298.11" dur="7.98">1979 there were ten million retail jobs</text>
  <text start="303.15" dur="6.41">United States at the time and what what</text>
  <text start="306.09" dur="9.52">had happened is that manufacturing jobs</text>
  <text start="309.56" dur="9.3">continually declined and retail jobs</text>
  <text start="315.61" dur="7.27">continually increased and it wasn&amp;#39;t an</text>
  <text start="318.86" dur="5.88">even trade off and this is why we see</text>
  <text start="322.88" dur="4.47">people out there who are struggling</text>
  <text start="324.74" dur="4.89">right now because if they had this type</text>
  <text start="327.35" dur="4.05">of job in manufacturing they would have</text>
  <text start="329.63" dur="4.56">to get a different job maybe in retail</text>
  <text start="331.4" dur="4.95">or the food industry making a lot less</text>
  <text start="334.19" dur="4.56">money and it makes it very difficult to</text>
  <text start="336.35" dur="3.66">survive now Amazon is out there and</text>
  <text start="338.75" dur="2.85">they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="340.01" dur="5.1">creating a hundred thousand new jobs in</text>
  <text start="341.6" dur="7.05">the next 18 months and when you look at</text>
  <text start="345.11" dur="7.73">their growth and their profits from</text>
  <text start="348.65" dur="8.76">sales well it&amp;#39;s been declining since</text>
  <text start="352.84" dur="6.67">2010 all the way up to 2014-15 and then</text>
  <text start="357.41" dur="5.13">had a little spike up but it&amp;#39;s declining</text>
  <text start="359.51" dur="5.76">once again but they&amp;#39;re going to add more</text>
  <text start="362.54" dur="3.78">employees of course this is talk right</text>
  <text start="365.27" dur="4.47">now we&amp;#39;ll have to see what happens</text>
  <text start="366.32" dur="5.52">because as we can see retail has not</text>
  <text start="369.74" dur="4.44">been doing that great even online orders</text>
  <text start="371.84" dur="4.62">not doing that great and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="374.18" dur="4.59">interesting about all this is that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="376.46" dur="6.209">still seeing layoffs and closures in</text>
  <text start="378.77" dur="6.6">retail continuing jobless claims are up</text>
  <text start="382.669" dur="6.081">over a hundred thousand since the</text>
  <text start="385.37" dur="5.76">election and stand at a four-month high</text>
  <text start="388.75" dur="6.01">this is the biggest percentage rise in</text>
  <text start="391.13" dur="5.76">claim since May of 2009 all happening as</text>
  <text start="394.76" dur="4.71">small business optimism consumer</text>
  <text start="396.89" dur="7.14">confidence and stocks are soaring all at</text>
  <text start="399.47" dur="6.84">the same time something&amp;#39;s wrong here now</text>
  <text start="404.03" dur="3.84">someone emailed me something about lows</text>
  <text start="406.31" dur="3.87">and how they&amp;#39;re restructuring right now</text>
  <text start="407.87" dur="5.73">and this is Richie a lonely for his</text>
  <text start="410.18" dur="6.21">first name where he says that as of</text>
  <text start="413.6" dur="7.71">January 17th we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="416.39" dur="7.56">something take place where lows might be</text>
  <text start="421.31" dur="3.93">getting rid of between 15 and 20</text>
  <text start="423.95" dur="4.86">thousand people they might be losing</text>
  <text start="425.24" dur="7.23">their jobs and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="428.81" dur="6.47">this is spreading more and more retail</text>
  <text start="432.47" dur="5.28">outlets well they&amp;#39;re getting rid of</text>
  <text start="435.28" dur="4.03">people they&amp;#39;re using the excuse of</text>
  <text start="437.75" dur="5.039">restructuring or they&amp;#39;re just going</text>
  <text start="439.31" dur="4.919">bankrupt now I know amazon is out there</text>
  <text start="442.789" dur="3.961">saying they going to be hiring a hundred</text>
  <text start="444.229" dur="4.02">thousand people over 18 months just in</text>
  <text start="446.75" dur="5.269">the year of 2016</text>
  <text start="448.249" dur="6.57">according to the government figures</text>
  <text start="452.019" dur="7.42">there were forty four thousand retail</text>
  <text start="454.819" dur="6.72">jobs that were lost so when we look at</text>
  <text start="459.439" dur="4.11">this and we go back to 2015 there&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="461.539" dur="5.4">more retail jobs and we can see there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="463.549" dur="6.09">more layoffs coming so is this number</text>
  <text start="466.939" dur="5.6">true and most likely not they always</text>
  <text start="469.639" dur="5.7">manipulate they don&amp;#39;t show the actual</text>
  <text start="472.539" dur="5.53">layoffs during that period of time and</text>
  <text start="475.339" dur="4.53">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="478.069" dur="4.25">there are many many stores that are</text>
  <text start="479.869" dur="5.94">going bankrupt they&amp;#39;re closing down</text>
  <text start="482.319" dur="6.82">there getting to lay off and it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="485.809" dur="5.97">look like the economy is expanding it</text>
  <text start="489.139" dur="4.77">looks like it is contracting now I know</text>
  <text start="491.779" dur="4.081">Donald Trump is out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="493.909" dur="3.96">trying to create these jobs but you have</text>
  <text start="495.86" dur="3.929">to remember we have lost millions and</text>
  <text start="497.869" dur="4.5">millions and millions of jobs actually</text>
  <text start="499.789" dur="5.4">we lost about 1.8 million manufacturing</text>
  <text start="502.369" dur="5.22">jobs up to this point and to get them</text>
  <text start="505.189" dur="5.19">all back in a small window is going to</text>
  <text start="507.589" dur="5.36">be quite impossible now something very</text>
  <text start="510.379" dur="4.861">interesting is happening in real estate</text>
  <text start="512.949" dur="6.01">Trulia found that the number of homes</text>
  <text start="515.24" dur="6.659">sell failures spiked in the fourth</text>
  <text start="518.959" dur="6.151">quarter of 2016 to nearly double the</text>
  <text start="521.899" dur="5.37">2015 rate with starter homes being most</text>
  <text start="525.11" dur="4.079">at risk nationally sales have been</text>
  <text start="527.269" dur="4.141">falling and an increasing rate rising to</text>
  <text start="529.189" dur="4.08">about four point three percent in the</text>
  <text start="531.41" dur="4.89">fourth quarter of 2016 from one point</text>
  <text start="533.269" dur="6.451">four percent of all listed properties</text>
  <text start="536.3" dur="5.43">during the fourth quarter of 2014 on an</text>
  <text start="539.72" dur="4.4">annual basis the failure rate has nearly</text>
  <text start="541.73" dur="6.979">doubled to three-point-nine percent in</text>
  <text start="544.12" dur="6.93">2016 up from 2.1 percent in 2015 and</text>
  <text start="548.709" dur="5.891">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="551.05" dur="6.909">individuals are saying yes I would like</text>
  <text start="554.6" dur="7.44">this home and then they never go through</text>
  <text start="557.959" dur="5.55">with it they signed the deal was sealed</text>
  <text start="562.04" dur="3.75">and then all of a sudden there was no</text>
  <text start="563.509" dur="5.19">deal and they&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of these</text>
  <text start="565.79" dur="6.21">failures pick up I mean if we look at</text>
  <text start="568.699" dur="6.841">Charleston South Carolina the starter</text>
  <text start="572" dur="6.59">sales fails the percentage in 2015 was</text>
  <text start="575.54" dur="6.37">2.7% in 20</text>
  <text start="578.59" dur="6.15">16 it&amp;#39;s sixteen point five percent in</text>

  <text start="584.74" dur="6.93">2015 and it&amp;#39;s 15.3 percent in 2016 in</text>
  <text start="589.05" dur="4.48">Houston Texas it was eight point seven</text>
  <text start="591.67" dur="6.15">percent now it&amp;#39;s twelve point eight</text>
  <text start="593.53" dur="6.66">percent in Atlanta Georgia it was 7.1</text>
  <text start="597.82" dur="6.66">percent in 2015 and thirteen point eight</text>

  <text start="848.67" dur="5.1">they couldn&amp;#39;t put their finger on it but</text>
  <text start="850.88" dur="5.56">eventually what happened and of course</text>
  <text start="853.77" dur="5.22">everyone was laughing at them oh these</text>
