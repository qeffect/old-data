  <text start="118.31" dur="4.83">the people said listen we&amp;#39;re done here</text>
  <text start="120.11" dur="6.03">let&amp;#39;s move on and the central bankers</text>
  <text start="123.14" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to keep the people</text>
  <text start="126.14" dur="4.5">within the central bank under their</text>
  <text start="128.66" dur="3.21">rules even when they want to leave and</text>
  <text start="130.64" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re saying if there&amp;#39;s a no deal</text>
  <text start="131.87" dur="4.92">brexit this could result in some</text>
  <text start="134.36" dur="4.14">difficulties for several economy sectors</text>
  <text start="136.79" dur="4.11">including food transportation</text>
  <text start="138.5" dur="3.63">pharmaceutical drugs and everything else</text>
  <text start="140.9" dur="3.66">now remember when they were having the</text>
  <text start="142.13" dur="5.34">referendum and they said if the people</text>
  <text start="144.56" dur="5.43">voted for the brexit the entire economy</text>
  <text start="147.47" dur="4.59">would implode and this is why you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="149.99" dur="4.62">do it they&amp;#39;re doing the same thing once</text>
  <text start="152.06" dur="5.07">again because they want a deal that</text>
  <text start="154.61" dur="4.95">benefit to them so what they do is they</text>
  <text start="157.13" dur="4.02">threaten they make it seem like it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="159.56" dur="4.34">going to fall apart if you don&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="161.15" dur="4.71">their way this goes along with</text>
  <text start="163.9" dur="3.55">cryptocurrencies this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="165.86" dur="3.9">demonizing this well you don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="167.45" dur="5.28">be in cryptocurrencies it has no store</text>
  <text start="169.76" dur="4.949">value it&amp;#39;s just electronic digital</text>
  <text start="172.73" dur="4.71">currency or actually it&amp;#39;s not even</text>
  <text start="174.709" dur="5.101">currency nothing to look at precious</text>
  <text start="177.44" dur="4.59">metals don&amp;#39;t even look over there it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="179.81" dur="3.57">hunk of metal it&amp;#39;s no big deal</text>
  <text start="182.03" dur="3.9">the only thing that you should be</text>
  <text start="183.38" dur="3.03">looking at is the paper that we create</text>
  <text start="185.93" dur="2.37">or</text>
  <text start="186.41" dur="3.18">that you know that button they push and</text>
  <text start="188.3" dur="3.93">they create digital currency which they</text>
  <text start="189.59" dur="5.01">control and we see the central bankers</text>
  <text start="192.23" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re getting nervous they know what</text>
  <text start="194.6" dur="3.75">is happening here their system is</text>
  <text start="196.64" dur="4.98">breaking down and it&amp;#39;s being ripped</text>
  <text start="198.35" dur="4.65">apart and they don&amp;#39;t like this and we</text>
  <text start="201.62" dur="3.42">can see the economies around the world</text>
  <text start="203" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;re all starting to fall apart now</text>
  <text start="205.04" dur="5.58">remember their system only lasts for a</text>
  <text start="208.7" dur="4.56">period of time and then it starts to</text>
  <text start="210.62" dur="4.53">disintegrate this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="213.26" dur="2.9">right now it is disintegrating right in</text>
  <text start="215.15" dur="3.39">front of our eyes</text>
  <text start="216.16" dur="3.91">because it&amp;#39;s only supposed to last for a</text>
  <text start="218.54" dur="4.29">certain period of time forty to forty</text>
  <text start="220.07" dur="4.29">five years at the most and they stretch</text>
  <text start="222.83" dur="3.09">this one a little bit longer because</text>
  <text start="224.36" dur="2.67">they thought they were going to have a</text>
  <text start="225.92" dur="2.85">certain candidate they thought they were</text>
  <text start="227.03" dur="3.11">going to go into war they thought they</text>
  <text start="228.77" dur="4.37">were going to be able to explain this</text>
  <text start="230.14" dur="5.65">you know explain the whole thing away by</text>
  <text start="233.14" dur="4.48">having this great event which would be</text>
  <text start="235.79" dur="3.3">war and this is why everyone won&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="237.62" dur="5.01">to sacrifice this is why we&amp;#39;d have</text>
  <text start="239.09" dur="5.79">austerity but this has not happened they</text>
  <text start="242.63" dur="3.54">don&amp;#39;t know what to do at this point so</text>
  <text start="244.88" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re getting nervous and afraid but</text>
  <text start="246.17" dur="4.2">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the entire</text>
  <text start="248.27" dur="3.99">system starting to break down I mean</text>
  <text start="250.37" dur="5.88">look at Australia the housing market</text>
  <text start="252.26" dur="7.5">starting to implode on itself retail</text>
  <text start="256.25" dur="4.95">spending growth stalled in July and they</text>
  <text start="259.76" dur="2.67">thought it was going to be a lot better</text>
  <text start="261.2" dur="4.11">they thought it was gonna be a point</text>
  <text start="262.43" dur="5.28">four percent game but it was flat its</text>
  <text start="265.31" dur="5.01">declining people aren&amp;#39;t spending the</text>
  <text start="267.71" dur="5.88">housing market is falling and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="270.32" dur="5.25">trying to explain all of this away right</text>
  <text start="273.59" dur="4.5">now they&amp;#39;re saying that home furnishing</text>
  <text start="275.57" dur="3.72">stores sales there are declining well of</text>
  <text start="278.09" dur="4.62">course well if people are not buying</text>
  <text start="279.29" dur="5.879">homes people need less sofas so we see a</text>
  <text start="282.71" dur="5.16">decline in home furnishings I mean this</text>
  <text start="285.169" dur="5.341">is just normal what we see here when a</text>
  <text start="287.87" dur="4.77">system starts to break down and real</text>
  <text start="290.51" dur="7.26">estate is attached to many different</text>
  <text start="292.64" dur="8.93">industries lumber electrical cement</text>
  <text start="297.77" dur="6.18">concrete home furnishings sheetrock</text>
  <text start="301.57" dur="4.81">those people who build the houses those</text>
  <text start="303.95" dur="4.65">people who manufacture everything else</text>
  <text start="306.38" dur="5">that goes into a house so each one of</text>
  <text start="308.6" dur="5.04">these areas it&amp;#39;s going to hit</text>
  <text start="311.38" dur="4.57">IBM right now here in the United States</text>
  <text start="313.64" dur="5.1">we see they are going to be laying off</text>
  <text start="315.95" dur="4.73">about 20,000 older workers and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="318.74" dur="5.37">going to be replacing them with</text>
  <text start="320.68" dur="6.639">37,000 foreigners as replacements now of</text>
  <text start="324.11" dur="5.97">course the pay is a lot less a lot of</text>
  <text start="327.319" dur="6.391">these workers that were that were older</text>
  <text start="330.08" dur="6.059">they had a retirement so when you go out</text>
  <text start="333.71" dur="4.44">and you subcontract you have no</text>
  <text start="336.139" dur="4.261">retirement you have no health benefits</text>
  <text start="338.15" dur="5.4">you have none of this and you bring them</text>
  <text start="340.4" dur="5.669">in as a consultant it&amp;#39;s a lot cheaper</text>
  <text start="343.55" dur="6.839">that pay is a lot less and we can see</text>
  <text start="346.069" dur="7.111">that IBM they are outsourcing all of</text>
  <text start="350.389" dur="5.221">this and the American public the people</text>
  <text start="353.18" dur="4.739">who have been working for IBM they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="355.61" dur="5.279">gonna be left out in the cold now there</text>
  <text start="357.919" dur="5.22">was a joint investigation by ProPublica</text>
  <text start="360.889" dur="4.021">and Mother Jones and reveals that about</text>
  <text start="363.139" dur="3.721">60% of the Americans that were laid off</text>
  <text start="364.91" dur="5.58">by IBM in the last five years were</text>
  <text start="366.86" dur="7.02">workers over the age of 40 this amounts</text>
  <text start="370.49" dur="5.22">to about 20,000 40 year old and older</text>
  <text start="373.88" dur="6.36">Americans being laid off by IBM since</text>
  <text start="375.71" dur="7.199">2014 at the same time iBM has attempted</text>
  <text start="380.24" dur="7.019">to import at least 37,000 foreign</text>
  <text start="382.909" dur="5.73">workers on h-1b visas since 2016 every</text>
  <text start="387.259" dur="3.451">year more than a hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="388.639" dur="4.891">foreign workers are brought into the US</text>
  <text start="390.71" dur="6.09">on the h-1b visa and are allowed to stay</text>
  <text start="393.53" dur="5.55">for about or up to six years so you can</text>
  <text start="396.8" dur="3.57">see over the many years where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="399.08" dur="3.54">telling us that this economy is</text>
  <text start="400.37" dur="4.079">fantastic it&amp;#39;s growing it&amp;#39;s looking</text>
  <text start="402.62" dur="3.329">great companies are doing fantastically</text>
  <text start="404.449" dur="4.02">we know a lot of the company&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="405.949" dur="4.44">buying back their own shares we know</text>
  <text start="408.469" dur="4.891">they&amp;#39;ve been shutting down different</text>
  <text start="410.389" dur="6.291">offices laying off different people see</text>
  <text start="413.36" dur="5.82">iBM is replacing the high paying</text>
  <text start="416.68" dur="4.239">American workers for foreign workers</text>
  <text start="419.18" dur="3.84">they don&amp;#39;t have to give them benefits</text>
  <text start="420.919" dur="4.321">they don&amp;#39;t have to give them retirement</text>
  <text start="423.02" dur="3.84">and it&amp;#39;s a lot cheaper and it makes the</text>
  <text start="425.24" dur="4.229">company look like it&amp;#39;s doing a lot</text>
  <text start="426.86" dur="5.309">better even if their work load is</text>
  <text start="429.469" dur="3.961">dropping it still looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="432.169" dur="3.661">doing better because they&amp;#39;re cutting</text>
  <text start="433.43" dur="5.1">costs so if the economy is doing so</text>
  <text start="435.83" dur="6.66">fantastically why would they have to do</text>
  <text start="438.53" dur="5.79">this they wouldn&amp;#39;t but we can see at</text>
  <text start="442.49" dur="3.959">this point a lot of companies are doing</text>
  <text start="444.32" dur="3.779">this because the economy is not doing</text>
  <text start="446.449" dur="4.321">that great and we can see around the</text>
  <text start="448.099" dur="5.651">world in Canada Australia Europe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="450.77" dur="6.01">all starting to implode all at once</text>
  <text start="453.75" dur="5.25">now the central bank they do not benefit</text>
  <text start="456.78" dur="4.19">the American people whatsoever they</text>
  <text start="459" dur="5.58">don&amp;#39;t benefit the country whatsoever</text>
  <text start="460.97" dur="5.86">they&amp;#39;re put into place to damage each</text>
  <text start="464.58" dur="6.11">and every one of these countries by</text>
  <text start="466.83" dur="7.2">putting them into debt and removing</text>
  <text start="470.69" dur="5.35">manufacturing removing high-paying jobs</text>

  <text start="476.04" dur="5.66">person into debt let&amp;#39;s take a look at</text>
  <text start="478.89" dur="5.94">what the central bank has done to the US</text>

  <text start="668.17" dur="6.69">well under the central bank rain no this</text>
  <text start="672.49" dur="4.38">sounds like economy that&amp;#39;s imploding on</text>
  <text start="674.86" dur="5.34">itself and it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="676.87" dur="5.01">as time goes on this is why the young</text>
  <text start="680.2" dur="4.89">people today they&amp;#39;re finding it very</text>
  <text start="681.88" dur="4.59">difficult to do anything because</text>

  <text start="698.14" dur="3.57">inflation if you know where to look</text>
  <text start="700.03" dur="4.32">because they&amp;#39;ve been stuffing it into</text>

  <text start="720.06" dur="5.79">the central banking system destroys</text>
  <text start="723.05" dur="5.2">economies they don&amp;#39;t help it this is why</text>
  <text start="725.85" dur="5.16">they always need to reset it after a</text>
  <text start="728.25" dur="5.55">period of time now before I talked about</text>
  <text start="731.01" dur="6.36">how I believe Powell is definitely</text>
  <text start="733.8" dur="6.33">working with Trump in some way and we</text>
  <text start="737.37" dur="4.44">can see that Powell he&amp;#39;s defending the</text>
  <text start="740.13" dur="4.17">central bank&amp;#39;s policy of gradually</text>
  <text start="741.81" dur="4.23">increasing key interest rates and he</text>
  <text start="744.3" dur="4.38">signaled that hikes will continue</text>
  <text start="746.04" dur="4.89">brushing off what Trump has said now</text>
  <text start="748.68" dur="2.94">this to me sounds like it&amp;#39;s just like</text>
  <text start="750.93" dur="2.25">clockwork</text>
  <text start="751.62" dur="3.12">just like with sessions just like</text>
  <text start="753.18" dur="4.41">everything else that&amp;#39;s going on right</text>
  <text start="754.74" dur="6.39">now where they&amp;#39;re playing against each</text>
  <text start="757.59" dur="5.58">other to make it seem like Powell is not</text>
  <text start="761.13" dur="4.14">working with Trump Powell is against</text>
  <text start="763.17" dur="6.06">Trump Trump doesn&amp;#39;t want him to raise</text>
  <text start="765.27" dur="6.75">the rates but he really does he wants</text>
  <text start="769.23" dur="6.48">the Fed to raise the rates to destroy</text>
  <text start="772.02" dur="6.15">the system now we know that Trump</text>
  <text start="775.71" dur="5.07">criticized what the Fed was doing and</text>
  <text start="778.17" dur="6.51">criticized the independence of the Fed</text>
  <text start="780.78" dur="6.45">and Powell did not directly reassert the</text>
  <text start="784.68" dur="4.98">feds legal independence from the White</text>
  <text start="787.23" dur="4.62">House which is very interesting he did</text>

  <text start="791.85" dur="5.94">what they think is right for the economy</text>
  <text start="794.27" dur="5.35">regardless of political pressure so you</text>
  <text start="797.79" dur="4.35">can see how this is all being played out</text>
  <text start="799.62" dur="4.41">right now and it looks like Trump and</text>
  <text start="802.14" dur="3.57">Powell it seems like they&amp;#39;re using the</text>
  <text start="804.03" dur="4.71">same exact strategy as Trump and</text>
  <text start="805.71" dur="5.73">sessions where they&amp;#39;re going against</text>
  <text start="808.74" dur="5.099">each other Trump is calling out the Fed</text>
  <text start="811.44" dur="4.649">the Fed is going to do exactly what</text>
  <text start="813.839" dur="4.891">Trump wants them to do and that is to</text>
  <text start="816.089" dur="3.781">raise interest rates because you know</text>
  <text start="818.73" dur="2.25">what happens when they raise the</text>
  <text start="819.87" dur="3.12">interest rates and he probably wants us</text>
  <text start="820.98" dur="4.53">to happen a lot quicker than then then</text>
  <text start="822.99" dur="5.04">not because when you raise the interest</text>
