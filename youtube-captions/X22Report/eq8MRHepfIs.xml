  <text start="417.28" dur="5.88">central bank balance sheets I mean think</text>
  <text start="420.729" dur="7.051">about what has been done here everything</text>
  <text start="423.16" dur="7.89">has been pushed up to the 1% and this is</text>
  <text start="427.78" dur="6.84">always done at the end of the system and</text>
  <text start="431.05" dur="5.4">believe me this is not paper wealth this</text>
  <text start="434.62" dur="4.5">is not there holding a lot of dollars</text>
  <text start="436.45" dur="6.029">they&amp;#39;re holding real assets because they</text>
  <text start="439.12" dur="5.01">know what&amp;#39;s coming they know the whole</text>
  <text start="442.479" dur="4.531">system is about to fall apart and this</text>
  <text start="444.13" dur="6.18">is why this happens and then at the end</text>
  <text start="447.01" dur="5.49">of the cycle they push all the wealth to</text>
  <text start="450.31" dur="2.68">those people that are inside they know</text>
  <text start="452.5" dur="3.85">what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="452.99" dur="4.44">and they&amp;#39;re not holding all the paper</text>
  <text start="456.35" dur="1.68">dollars because those are gonna be</text>
  <text start="457.43" dur="6.019">worthless</text>

  <text start="463.449" dur="6.551">silver stocks you name it that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="467.27" dur="5.97">to be worth something after their recent</text>
  <text start="470" dur="5.729">occurs now we understand that the Fed is</text>
  <text start="473.24" dur="3.84">going to continually raise rates Trump</text>
  <text start="475.729" dur="3.391">has already put it out there by</text>
  <text start="477.08" dur="3.54">criticizing the Fed making it known that</text>
  <text start="479.12" dur="2.91">he thought Powell was going to be an</text>
  <text start="480.62" dur="3.389">easy money Fed he didn&amp;#39;t know he was</text>
  <text start="482.03" dur="4.08">going to be an interest rate Fed and</text>
  <text start="484.009" dur="5.101">this was the signal to let everyone know</text>
  <text start="486.11" dur="5.489">who is paying attention that the Fed is</text>
  <text start="489.11" dur="5.429">doing what he wants he wants the Fed to</text>
  <text start="491.599" dur="4.35">raise rates very very slowly he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="494.539" dur="3.181">want to he doesn&amp;#39;t want the Fed to do it</text>
  <text start="495.949" dur="3.871">too quickly because if the Fed raises</text>
  <text start="497.72" dur="4.229">the rates too quickly what happens the</text>
  <text start="499.82" dur="4.71">entire system falls apart he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="501.949" dur="4.891">want the system falling apart until he</text>
  <text start="504.53" dur="5.1">preps the United States for this</text>
  <text start="506.84" dur="5.579">transition and we can see that the Fed</text>
  <text start="509.63" dur="5.399">is moving at a very slow pace as it was</text>
  <text start="512.419" dur="5.191">before they&amp;#39;re continuing this now the</text>
  <text start="515.029" dur="4.14">second rate the second time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="517.61" dur="4.469">going to raise the rate this year is</text>
  <text start="519.169" dur="4.11">supposed to be in December I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="522.079" dur="2.671">if they&amp;#39;re going to do it in December</text>
  <text start="523.279" dur="5.011">they might push it off to the beginning</text>
  <text start="524.75" dur="5.25">of 2019 to make sure that Trump the</text>
  <text start="528.29" dur="3.38">Patriots they can put everything in a</text>
  <text start="530" dur="5.7">place but we&amp;#39;ll see what happens but</text>
  <text start="531.67" dur="5.26">when the rates move up what happens well</text>
  <text start="535.7" dur="3.66">we can see already with the real estate</text>
  <text start="536.93" dur="3.63">market as the rates move up there are</text>
  <text start="539.36" dur="2.849">more more people that are pushed out of</text>
  <text start="540.56" dur="3.36">the market they can&amp;#39;t afford the homes</text>
  <text start="542.209" dur="4.62">and the real estate market starts to</text>
  <text start="543.92" dur="5.82">implode on itself a lot of individuals</text>
  <text start="546.829" dur="4.471">who were trying to go to college might</text>
  <text start="549.74" dur="3.33">have a difficult time getting a student</text>
  <text start="551.3" dur="3.81">loan those people that are trying to</text>
  <text start="553.07" dur="3.959">purchase an automobile they might hold</text>
  <text start="555.11" dur="3.75">off and say you know something rates are</text>
  <text start="557.029" dur="3.75">moving up we can&amp;#39;t afford this right now</text>
  <text start="558.86" dur="4.229">we&amp;#39;re not gonna buy an automobile</text>
  <text start="560.779" dur="3.93">so what else happens here corporate</text>
  <text start="563.089" dur="4.831">government consumer debt especially</text>
  <text start="564.709" dur="8.101">student debt there are all at record</text>
  <text start="567.92" dur="6.72">levels with higher interest rates it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="572.81" dur="2.64">going to send the economy back into</text>
  <text start="574.64" dur="3.33">recession</text>
  <text start="575.45" dur="4.71">and government tax revenues corporate</text>
  <text start="577.97" dur="5.7">sales and profits and personal incomes</text>
  <text start="580.16" dur="6.26">all fall at the same time interest costs</text>
  <text start="583.67" dur="7.31">are soaring because of those higher</text>
  <text start="586.42" dur="7.109">rates so from us corporation to</text>
  <text start="590.98" dur="5.909">Washington&amp;#39;s budget to consumers balance</text>
  <text start="593.529" dur="7.651">sheets the next recession might be the</text>
  <text start="596.889" dur="6.031">death spiral all the way down and Trump</text>
  <text start="601.18" dur="4.32">and Powell they know this they know if</text>
  <text start="602.92" dur="6.12">they raise these rates it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="605.5" dur="5.67">kick off a death spiral and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="609.04" dur="4.56">doing it at a very slow pace this is</text>
  <text start="611.17" dur="4.95">what the Fed has done in the past and if</text>
  <text start="613.6" dur="3.9">we go back prior to 2008 the Fed did</text>
  <text start="616.12" dur="3.48">this and if you look at the interest</text>
  <text start="617.5" dur="4.56">rates it looks like a little step going</text>
  <text start="619.6" dur="4.58">up they did it very slowly so this way</text>
  <text start="622.06" dur="4.95">nobody realizes what is going on here</text>
  <text start="624.18" dur="6.459">this time around it&amp;#39;s a little different</text>
  <text start="627.01" dur="6.54">they want the system to crash they need</text>
  <text start="630.639" dur="6.151">to crash the central bank system to</text>
  <text start="633.55" dur="6.539">usher in a new system and we can see</text>
  <text start="636.79" dur="6.84">right now that Powell is doing exactly</text>
  <text start="640.089" dur="5.971">what Trump doesn&amp;#39;t want him to do which</text>
  <text start="643.63" dur="4.5">means this is what he wants him to do he</text>
  <text start="646.06" dur="4.95">doesn&amp;#39;t want this Fed to be an easy</text>
  <text start="648.13" dur="5.579">money Fed he wants this Fed Chairman to</text>
  <text start="651.01" dur="4.829">raise the rates so they can bring down</text>
  <text start="653.709" dur="5.49">the system remember there are good guys</text>
  <text start="655.839" dur="4.981">bad guys in each area of the government</text>
  <text start="659.199" dur="2.58">and the Federal Reserve remember the</text>
  <text start="660.82" dur="4.23">Federal Reserve is not part of the</text>
  <text start="661.779" dur="5.911">government and it looks like Powell most</text>
  <text start="665.05" dur="5.64">likely is working with Trump now the</text>
  <text start="667.69" dur="4.53">plan and we discussed this before is to</text>
  <text start="670.69" dur="4.889">bring everything back as much as</text>
  <text start="672.22" dur="5.91">possible before the system crashes so</text>
  <text start="675.579" dur="6.961">the United States is prepared for this</text>
  <text start="678.13" dur="5.819">reset now we can see that for him to do</text>
  <text start="682.54" dur="4.01">this and not just him there&amp;#39;s others</text>
  <text start="683.949" dur="5.961">that are working with him to push</text>
  <text start="686.55" dur="6.33">tariffs on certain countries like China</text>
  <text start="689.91" dur="6.369">to make it look like there&amp;#39;s a trade war</text>
  <text start="692.88" dur="5.98">he just couldn&amp;#39;t let the economy sit the</text>
  <text start="696.279" dur="4.05">way it was sitting because this way if</text>
  <text start="698.86" dur="3.209">it was just sitting the way it was</text>
  <text start="700.329" dur="3.63">sitting and the economy was</text>
  <text start="702.069" dur="4.291">deteriorating and it was starting to</text>
  <text start="703.959" dur="4.951">show up in these numbers the mainstream</text>
  <text start="706.36" dur="4.77">media the deep state would all be out</text>
  <text start="708.91" dur="4.619">there saying oh look see the tariffs his</text>
  <text start="711.13" dur="4.649">tax plan it&amp;#39;s bringing the economy down</text>
  <text start="713.529" dur="5.731">remember the economy is built on an</text>
  <text start="715.779" dur="6.511">illusion it&amp;#39;s built on fake data</text>
  <text start="719.26" dur="4.92">so Trump took this data and they</text>
  <text start="722.29" dur="3.21">manipulated even further it&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="724.18" dur="3.15">been manipulated but they took it to the</text>
  <text start="725.5" dur="3.75">nth degree to make it look like the</text>
  <text start="727.33" dur="4.65">economy&amp;#39;s doing a lot better they needed</text>
  <text start="729.25" dur="6.06">to do this before they set their plan in</text>
  <text start="731.98" dur="4.95">motion this way it countered anything</text>
  <text start="735.31" dur="3.33">the mainstream media or the deep State</text>
  <text start="736.93" dur="4.56">was going to say about the economy and</text>
  <text start="738.64" dur="6.6">if you notice they really can&amp;#39;t say much</text>
  <text start="741.49" dur="6.33">they started to in the beginning but</text>
  <text start="745.24" dur="4.8">once Trump came out with the</text>
  <text start="747.82" dur="4.77">unemployment numbers that GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="750.04" dur="4.56">that looked like you know this was</text>
  <text start="752.59" dur="4.92">completely impossible and he made it</text>
  <text start="754.6" dur="5.64">possible they really couldn&amp;#39;t say much I</text>
  <text start="757.51" dur="4.77">mean they&amp;#39;re trying to do many different</text>
  <text start="760.24" dur="3.51">things by saying the housing market is</text>
  <text start="762.28" dur="3.03">falling apart because what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="763.75" dur="3.27">now is they&amp;#39;re looking at the real</text>
  <text start="765.31" dur="3.81">economy which they&amp;#39;ve never done really</text>
  <text start="767.02" dur="3.63">before they always pretended everything</text>
  <text start="769.12" dur="3.3">was great but now they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="770.65" dur="3.27">look at you know oh let&amp;#39;s take a look at</text>
  <text start="772.42" dur="3.15">the real economy let&amp;#39;s take a look at</text>
  <text start="773.92" dur="4.08">retail let&amp;#39;s take a look at this and</text>
  <text start="775.57" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re trying to show that the economy</text>
  <text start="778" dur="5.04">is not doing that well but Trump has the</text>
  <text start="780.61" dur="5.46">upper hand because the people are now</text>
  <text start="783.04" dur="5.49">used to listening looking at the stock</text>
  <text start="786.07" dur="4.26">market they&amp;#39;re used to this looking at</text>
  <text start="788.53" dur="3.81">the GDP numbers they&amp;#39;re used to looking</text>
  <text start="790.33" dur="5.22">at the unemployment numbers they&amp;#39;re used</text>
  <text start="792.34" dur="5.82">to hearing this over and over and over</text>
  <text start="795.55" dur="5.01">again from the previous administrations</text>
  <text start="798.16" dur="4.98">from the mainstream media so the</text>
  <text start="800.56" dur="4.62">mainstream media has kind of cornered</text>
  <text start="803.14" dur="3.66">themselves because people really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="805.18" dur="3.84">pay attention to anything else except</text>
  <text start="806.8" dur="4.62">those numbers unless you&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="809.02" dur="4.02">listening to alternative media we were</text>
  <text start="811.42" dur="2.25">breaking down and going through all the</text>
  <text start="813.04" dur="2.64">different numbers</text>
  <text start="813.67" dur="4.86">to show that the economy is not doing as</text>
  <text start="815.68" dur="4.59">well as they were saying and we can see</text>
  <text start="818.53" dur="3.99">from everything that we&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="820.27" dur="4.98">at from the past all the way up to the</text>
  <text start="822.52" dur="4.32">present we can see that yet this is one</text>
  <text start="825.25" dur="4.56">gigantic manipulation and we can</text>
  <text start="826.84" dur="4.47">understand why they are doing this but</text>
  <text start="829.81" dur="4.2">the mainstream media and the deep state</text>
  <text start="831.31" dur="4.58">they&amp;#39;re backed into a corner and Trump</text>
  <text start="834.01" dur="4.65">the Patriots they know this they know</text>
  <text start="835.89" dur="4.99">that there&amp;#39;s nothing they can do about</text>
  <text start="838.66" dur="3.96">this because their plan again they have</text>
  <text start="840.88" dur="3.3">all different play books and they</text>
  <text start="842.62" dur="3.99">thought they had this one they were</text>
  <text start="844.18" dur="5.54">going to wait maybe a year or so before</text>
  <text start="846.61" dur="5.64">Trump said okay this is my economy and</text>
  <text start="849.72" dur="3.339">then they were going to take it and say</text>
  <text start="852.25" dur="2.669">the economy&amp;#39;s fall</text>
  <text start="853.059" dur="4.35">apart because of these tariffs because</text>
  <text start="854.919" dur="5.22">of these new tax laws because of</text>
  <text start="857.409" dur="3.84">removing Obamacare doing all these</text>
  <text start="860.139" dur="3.72">different things this is why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="861.249" dur="5.19">falling apart but now they can&amp;#39;t this is</text>
  <text start="863.859" dur="5.82">why he came out and he told Obama I do</text>
  <text start="866.439" dur="6.06">have the magic wand which means he knows</text>
  <text start="869.679" dur="4.2">how the manipulation game works he can</text>

  <text start="875.739" dur="5.61">any way he wants and that&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="879.129" dur="4.38">is happening right now now it looks like</text>
  <text start="881.349" dur="5.58">he has full control over the Fed and</text>
