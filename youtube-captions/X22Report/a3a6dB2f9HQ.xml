  <text start="68.11" dur="5.399">and most people are not ready let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="71.74" dur="4.23">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="73.509" dur="4.131">news now we&amp;#39;re starting to see from</text>
  <text start="75.97" dur="5.189">different polls like the Gallup poll</text>
  <text start="77.64" dur="5.08">that people are starting to wake up and</text>
  <text start="81.159" dur="5.761">they&amp;#39;re starting to realize that the</text>
  <text start="82.72" dur="6.209">economy isn&amp;#39;t as great as it seems even</text>
  <text start="86.92" dur="5.22">the conference board and the conference</text>
  <text start="88.929" dur="4.981">board they receive grants from the</text>
  <text start="92.14" dur="3.6">government and they do whatever the</text>
  <text start="93.91" dur="5.03">government wants but what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="95.74" dur="6.659">right now is that we&amp;#39;re seeing that the</text>
  <text start="98.94" dur="6.64">economic expectations for the future</text>
  <text start="102.399" dur="4.92">they are tumbling right now and we can</text>
  <text start="105.58" dur="4.44">see this in the conference board we see</text>
  <text start="107.319" dur="5.851">this in the image we also now see it in</text>
  <text start="110.02" dur="4.86">the Gallup surveys which is the people</text>
  <text start="113.17" dur="3.569">surveys where they go out to actual</text>
  <text start="114.88" dur="3.299">people and they ask them what do you</text>
  <text start="116.739" dur="3.33">think the economy is what your</text>
  <text start="118.179" dur="4.08">expectations are and where do you think</text>
  <text start="120.069" dur="5.101">we are headed and a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="122.259" dur="4.711">out there saying well the future does</text>
  <text start="125.17" dur="3.929">not look that great so they know</text>
  <text start="126.97" dur="4.29">something&amp;#39;s wrong in the background they</text>
  <text start="129.099" dur="3.75">know something&amp;#39;s not right and many</text>
  <text start="131.26" dur="3.3">people are starting to wake up not</text>
  <text start="132.849" dur="4.411">enough I believe I believe there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="134.56" dur="5.16">of people still sleeping still living in</text>
  <text start="137.26" dur="4.14">that illusionary world that everything</text>
  <text start="139.72" dur="2.82">is going to be ok and everything&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="141.4" dur="3.949">to be fine and we have nothing to worry</text>
  <text start="142.54" dur="5.91">about and what we&amp;#39;re starting to see is</text>
  <text start="145.349" dur="5.411">each of these economic sectors as we</text>
  <text start="148.45" dur="5.46">look at each one of them each one is</text>
  <text start="150.76" dur="5.04">breaking down now and we&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="153.91" dur="4.26">real estate for a very long time and we</text>
  <text start="155.8" dur="4.53">can see right now that Case Shiller they</text>
  <text start="158.17" dur="3.63">came out with their report about home</text>
  <text start="160.33" dur="5.879">price growth and they&amp;#39;re saying that it</text>
  <text start="161.8" dur="6.689">slowed by 0.28% month-on-month now this</text>
  <text start="166.209" dur="5.821">is the weakest since August of 2016 now</text>
  <text start="168.489" dur="6.571">remember this time period for real</text>
  <text start="172.03" dur="5.67">estate from the spring to the summer to</text>
  <text start="175.06" dur="4.56">maybe the beginning of fall this is the</text>
  <text start="177.7" dur="4.349">period of time it&amp;#39;s almost like the</text>
  <text start="179.62" dur="5.22">holiday season for real estate this is</text>
  <text start="182.049" dur="3.631">when people go out and they purchase the</text>
  <text start="184.84" dur="2.91">homes</text>
  <text start="185.68" dur="5.729">usually the winter months it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="187.75" dur="4.95">slower and the price is right now well</text>
  <text start="191.409" dur="3.481">they&amp;#39;re starting to come down</text>
  <text start="192.7" dur="4.53">actually when I look around the country</text>
  <text start="194.89" dur="5.459">and especially where I am I see a lot of</text>
  <text start="197.23" dur="5.729">houses up for sale and when I actually</text>
  <text start="200.349" dur="5.191">go to look at them to see what is</text>
  <text start="202.959" dur="4.441">actually going on and these houses that</text>
  <text start="205.54" dur="5.55">are for sale</text>
  <text start="207.4" dur="6.479">people are asking these outrageous</text>
  <text start="211.09" dur="5.489">prices that don&amp;#39;t even make sense and</text>
  <text start="213.879" dur="5.521">then when you look you can see a month</text>
  <text start="216.579" dur="5.371">goes by they start to lower it by five</text>
  <text start="219.4" dur="5.369">thousand another month goes by they</text>
  <text start="221.95" dur="5.009">lowered another ten thousand and usually</text>
  <text start="224.769" dur="3.571">the rule of thumb for real estate if no</text>
  <text start="226.959" dur="4.321">one comes to look at your home within</text>
  <text start="228.34" dur="5.22">like three weeks your price is way too</text>
  <text start="231.28" dur="4.98">high and some of these homes that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="233.56" dur="5.94">looking at these homes have been for</text>
  <text start="236.26" dur="5.22">sale for over four months actually</text>
  <text start="239.5" dur="3.599">there&amp;#39;s one house that&amp;#39;s been for sale</text>
  <text start="241.48" dur="4.86">for over a year now</text>
  <text start="243.099" dur="5.131">because what is happening is the market</text>
  <text start="246.34" dur="3.63">is coming down and all these people are</text>
  <text start="248.23" dur="5.61">chasing the market we saw this happened</text>
  <text start="249.97" dur="6.18">back in 2007-2008 and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="253.84" dur="4.829">right now and this is also confirmed</text>
  <text start="256.15" dur="4.26">with a wolf Richter out where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="258.669" dur="3.691">looking at San Francisco and many other</text>
  <text start="260.41" dur="4.14">areas where the bubbles are starting to</text>
  <text start="262.36" dur="4.71">pop and prices are starting to fall</text>
  <text start="264.55" dur="4.44">actually Case Shiller is looking at</text>
  <text start="267.07" dur="4.56">places like Cleveland Boston San</text>
  <text start="268.99" dur="6.03">Francisco Washington Tampa Florida and</text>
  <text start="271.63" dur="7.5">they are reporting that yes home prices</text>
  <text start="275.02" dur="6.09">are falling in these areas now for San</text>
  <text start="279.13" dur="4.5">Francisco this is the cent second</text>
  <text start="281.11" dur="5.67">monthly drop of home prices which tells</text>
  <text start="283.63" dur="4.98">us that people are not going out and</text>
  <text start="286.78" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re not purchasing the homes like</text>
  <text start="288.61" dur="3.75">they used to so what happens is these</text>
  <text start="290.38" dur="5.43">people start lowering their prices and</text>
  <text start="292.36" dur="7.83">this has already begun now on top of</text>
  <text start="295.81" dur="6.359">this Fannie Mae is out there and they</text>
  <text start="300.19" dur="3.89">are saying that mortgage demand is</text>
  <text start="302.169" dur="5.37">cooling right now</text>
  <text start="304.08" dur="6.61">lenders they&amp;#39;ve increased their concerns</text>
  <text start="307.539" dur="4.111">over the economic conditions and what</text>
  <text start="310.69" dur="4.349">they&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="311.65" dur="6.329">is less and less people coming out to</text>
  <text start="315.039" dur="4.471">take out a mortgage the report across</text>
  <text start="317.979" dur="2.791">the three loan types the share</text>
  <text start="319.51" dur="3.6">of lenders who reported growth in</text>
  <text start="320.77" dur="6.45">purchase mortgage demand dropped to the</text>
  <text start="323.11" dur="7.32">lowest net reading in years for a second</text>
  <text start="327.22" dur="6.47">quarter period and we can see this we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="330.43" dur="6.66">going back to 2015 going to 2016 to 2017</text>
  <text start="333.69" dur="5.35">the mortgages where people normally</text>
  <text start="337.09" dur="4.56">would be getting them it is declining</text>
  <text start="339.04" dur="4.26">and we&amp;#39;re reaching a point where people</text>
  <text start="341.65" dur="3.6">are saying you know something I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="343.3" dur="4.32">completely out of the market now the</text>
  <text start="345.25" dur="4.41">report pointed out that this drop in</text>
  <text start="347.62" dur="5.19">demand for purchase mortgages confirms</text>
  <text start="349.66" dur="6.51">fannie mae&amp;#39;s report earlier in June that</text>
  <text start="352.81" dur="6.39">found that Americans were souring on the</text>
  <text start="356.17" dur="6.18">housing market now we have to remember</text>
  <text start="359.2" dur="5.88">how was this housing market created it</text>
  <text start="362.35" dur="4.2">was created by the central banks it was</text>
  <text start="365.08" dur="3.71">created by hedge fund investment</text>
  <text start="366.55" dur="6.03">companies it was created by foreign</text>
  <text start="368.79" dur="6.85">investors by speculators it was not</text>
  <text start="372.58" dur="6.09">created by the everyday person and they</text>
  <text start="375.64" dur="5.37">only did it in specific cities and now</text>
  <text start="378.67" dur="4.8">what&amp;#39;s happening is in those areas</text>
  <text start="381.01" dur="6.06">we&amp;#39;ve reached the top of the bubble and</text>
  <text start="383.47" dur="5.76">people are trying to sell their homes at</text>
  <text start="387.07" dur="4.32">the height of the bubble and when you</text>
  <text start="389.23" dur="4.29">see more and more houses go up for sale</text>
  <text start="391.39" dur="3.84">especially when you see a house and then</text>
  <text start="393.52" dur="3.78">right next to as another house and then</text>
  <text start="395.23" dur="4.74">two houses down there&amp;#39;s another house</text>
  <text start="397.3" dur="4.92">for sale you know we are at the top of</text>
  <text start="399.97" dur="3.63">the bubble and when you see no traffic</text>
  <text start="402.22" dur="3.15">coming to these homes in these houses</text>
  <text start="403.6" dur="4.47">stay on the market longer and longer and</text>
  <text start="405.37" dur="4.92">longer you know there is a major problem</text>
  <text start="408.07" dur="4.53">brewing now is this happening in every</text>
  <text start="410.29" dur="5.31">single part of the country no it happens</text>
  <text start="412.6" dur="5.58">in small isolated areas and then it</text>
  <text start="415.6" dur="5.88">starts to spread all over the place go</text>
  <text start="418.18" dur="6.33">back to 2007-2008 where everything was</text>
  <text start="421.48" dur="3.57">booming and I remember it remember it</text>
  <text start="424.51" dur="4.11">very well</text>
  <text start="425.05" dur="6.3">up in New York traffic dried up but in</text>
  <text start="428.62" dur="4.17">Miami they were building like crazy</text>
  <text start="431.35" dur="4.74">there were speculators all over the</text>
  <text start="432.79" dur="6.57">place six months later Miami came to a</text>
  <text start="436.09" dur="4.74">complete screeching halt and this is</text>
  <text start="439.36" dur="3.45">what&amp;#39;s going to happen throughout the</text>
  <text start="440.83" dur="3.9">country because we can already see that</text>
  <text start="442.81" dur="4.95">the Fed is saying okay we&amp;#39;re ready to</text>
  <text start="444.73" dur="5.01">sell our toxic real estate and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="447.76" dur="3.18">going to get top dollar and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="449.74" dur="3.33">going to do is they&amp;#39;re going to sell it</text>
  <text start="450.94" dur="3.57">at the height try to</text>
  <text start="453.07" dur="3.72">like everything they possibly can and</text>
  <text start="454.51" dur="4.14">when everything drops again they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="456.79" dur="4.29">going to buy up everything for pennies</text>
  <text start="458.65" dur="6.09">on the dollar this is how central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="461.08" dur="7.89">work now one thing that we are looking</text>
  <text start="464.74" dur="6.68">at is the tech stock bubble now remember</text>
  <text start="468.97" dur="5.88">this has been blown up by central banks</text>
  <text start="471.42" dur="6.4">it&amp;#39;s been blown up by Switzerland the</text>
  <text start="474.85" dur="4.68">Bank of Japan the Fed and many others</text>
  <text start="477.82" dur="4.77">where they&amp;#39;ve been purchasing tech</text>
  <text start="479.53" dur="6.09">stocks like crazy trying to keep the</text>
  <text start="482.59" dur="5.07">stock market up the Nasdaq up and</text>
  <text start="485.62" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re continually and they&amp;#39;re buying a</text>
  <text start="487.66" dur="4.77">lot more stocks than just that but what</text>
  <text start="489.55" dur="7.17">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the tech</text>
  <text start="492.43" dur="8.43">stock area well it looks like things are</text>
  <text start="496.72" dur="8.79">falling apart rapidly so the Nasdaq ETF</text>
  <text start="500.86" dur="7.35">has broken its bull market trend line</text>
  <text start="505.51" dur="4.68">even worse it has failed to reclaim this</text>
  <text start="508.21" dur="4.769">line despite a strong bounce this is a</text>
  <text start="510.19" dur="5.22">major warning that the upwards momentum</text>
  <text start="512.979" dur="4.741">is gone the next leg down well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="515.41" dur="4.77">going to be a doozy this is a big deal</text>
  <text start="517.72" dur="5.37">for the broader market as even the S&amp;amp;P</text>
  <text start="520.18" dur="4.65">500 has seen most of its gains produced</text>
  <text start="523.09" dur="6.03">by large tech companies such as Apple</text>
  <text start="524.83" dur="9.09">Amazon and many others if the tech area</text>
  <text start="529.12" dur="7.44">goes the entire market will go and we</text>
  <text start="533.92" dur="7.29">can see there&amp;#39;s major major problems in</text>
  <text start="536.56" dur="8.52">this area now very interestingly the IMF</text>
  <text start="541.21" dur="6.66">was looking at Trump&amp;#39;s policies is</text>
  <text start="545.08" dur="6.84">economic policies and they were basing</text>
  <text start="547.87" dur="6.66">the GDP forecast on this and what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="551.92" dur="5.22">seen already is that the IMF is saying</text>
  <text start="554.53" dur="5.52">okay Trump he has no economic policies</text>
  <text start="557.14" dur="6.3">you can&amp;#39;t get anything done and the IMF</text>
  <text start="560.05" dur="8.4">right now has cut their GDP forecast to</text>
  <text start="563.44" dur="7.74">2.1 in 2017 from 2.3 not that much of a</text>
  <text start="568.45" dur="6.96">difference and we know that the IMF has</text>
  <text start="571.18" dur="6.99">always been wrong so why are they out</text>
  <text start="575.41" dur="5.82">there saying this what does this tell us</text>
  <text start="578.17" dur="5.73">well it tells us a couple of things</text>
  <text start="581.23" dur="4.95">first they&amp;#39;re saying that the Trump</text>
  <text start="583.9" dur="2.97">administration will not be able to liver</text>
  <text start="586.18" dur="3.03">the</text>
  <text start="586.87" dur="4.92">he pledged tax cuts and higher</text>
  <text start="589.21" dur="4.92">infrastructure spending and because he</text>
  <text start="591.79" dur="4.95">can&amp;#39;t do anything the economy is not</text>
  <text start="594.13" dur="4.95">going to do well even if he did those</text>
  <text start="596.74" dur="4.349">things they would say his economic</text>
  <text start="599.08" dur="4.71">policies would have made the economy</text>
  <text start="601.089" dur="5.761">even worse so no matter which way you</text>
  <text start="603.79" dur="5.489">look at it he&amp;#39;s not going to win he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="606.85" dur="4.44">not going to win in how this economy is</text>
  <text start="609.279" dur="5.161">coming down because their whole agenda</text>
  <text start="611.29" dur="4.92">is basically to blame it on him so</text>
  <text start="614.44" dur="3.27">basically the IMF is saying that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="616.21" dur="3.99">removed the assumed of fiscal stimulus</text>
  <text start="617.71" dur="4.71">from our forecast and this is why it</text>
  <text start="620.2" dur="5.79">doesn&amp;#39;t look good and we can see going</text>
  <text start="622.42" dur="5.04">out all the way to to 2022 they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="625.99" dur="2.58">showing that the GDP numbers are</text>
  <text start="627.46" dur="4.71">continually declining declining</text>
  <text start="628.57" dur="6">declining never improving now when we</text>
  <text start="632.17" dur="5.31">look at the entire situation the global</text>
  <text start="634.57" dur="4.59">situation we can see that the economies</text>
  <text start="637.48" dur="4.38">of the world they&amp;#39;re not going to get</text>
  <text start="639.16" dur="4.95">any better actually since 2008 since the</text>
  <text start="641.86" dur="4.44">Great Recession most of the economies</text>
  <text start="644.11" dur="4.65">haven&amp;#39;t moved at all actually from all</text>
  <text start="646.3" dur="5.27">the printing and creation of all this</text>
  <text start="648.76" dur="5.43">currency of all this debt by moving</text>
  <text start="651.57" dur="5.019">currencies from one bank to another</text>
  <text start="654.19" dur="5.04">having each bank do stimulus at</text>
  <text start="656.589" dur="4.561">different times by saving the banks by</text>
  <text start="659.23" dur="4.44">buying up toxic real estate by buying</text>
  <text start="661.15" dur="6.24">Treasury bonds all they have done was</text>
  <text start="663.67" dur="6.57">created an illusion that the economy has</text>
  <text start="667.39" dur="5.13">been improving I mean a lot of</text>
  <text start="670.24" dur="5.01">corporations do this remember Enron</text>
  <text start="672.52" dur="4.95">where everyone was like wow this company</text>
  <text start="675.25" dur="3.99">is amazing they&amp;#39;re doing fantastically</text>
  <text start="677.47" dur="4.77">everything is great it was an illusion</text>
  <text start="679.24" dur="5.49">and all of a sudden one day it all</text>
  <text start="682.24" dur="4.92">disappeared the same things going to</text>
  <text start="684.73" dur="4.32">happen once again because when we look</text>
  <text start="687.16" dur="5.46">at all these economic indicators and we</text>
  <text start="689.05" dur="6.12">look at retail we look at real estate we</text>
  <text start="692.62" dur="4.77">look at the GDP calculation we look at</text>
  <text start="695.17" dur="5.25">the unemployment calculation we look at</text>
  <text start="697.39" dur="5.34">the corporate defaults we look at the</text>
  <text start="700.42" dur="4.59">loan creation we look at the credit</text>
  <text start="702.73" dur="3.42">impulse we start to look at all these</text>
  <text start="705.01" dur="3.63">different things and many other things</text>
  <text start="706.15" dur="5.82">we start to realize when we put all the</text>
  <text start="708.64" dur="7.35">pieces together that this is an illusion</text>
  <text start="711.97" dur="8.14">that the central banks have created to</text>
  <text start="715.99" dur="7.99">convince everyone that they fixed the</text>
  <text start="720.11" dur="6.84">problem since 2008 they did this on</text>
  <text start="723.98" dur="6.09">purpose because what they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="726.95" dur="5.69">is they&amp;#39;ve been preparing for the next</text>
  <text start="730.07" dur="5.009">downturn that&amp;#39;s what this was all about</text>
  <text start="732.64" dur="4.8">because they knew eventually that the</text>
  <text start="735.079" dur="7.231">system couldn&amp;#39;t carry on the world</text>
  <text start="737.44" dur="6.459">cannot handle any more debt and people</text>
  <text start="742.31" dur="3.51">are out there saying well can&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="743.899" dur="4.471">just keep printing and printing and</text>
  <text start="745.82" dur="5.79">printing well someone has to pay for the</text>
  <text start="748.37" dur="6.12">interest and if the American people and</text>
  <text start="751.61" dur="4.95">the European people they don&amp;#39;t have jobs</text>
  <text start="754.49" dur="5.63">and these people aren&amp;#39;t taxed who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="756.56" dur="6.63">paying for it yes they can take out more</text>
  <text start="760.12" dur="5.23">money from the Fed where the Fed will</text>
  <text start="763.19" dur="5.13">loan them the money but then you have</text>
  <text start="765.35" dur="6.45">more interest on the debt and you add to</text>
  <text start="768.32" dur="5.91">the debt this is a no-win situation</text>
  <text start="771.8" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s nothing they can do at this</text>
  <text start="774.23" dur="4.89">point yes they can write off the debt</text>
  <text start="776.06" dur="5.459">but central bankers don&amp;#39;t do that they</text>
  <text start="779.12" dur="5.19">don&amp;#39;t like to do that because if they do</text>
  <text start="781.519" dur="3.361">do it then it shows other countries</text>
  <text start="784.31" dur="2.16">we&amp;#39;ll wait a minute</text>
  <text start="784.88" dur="2.97">they wrote off to debt we would like to</text>
  <text start="786.47" dur="2.58">write after that and if that country</text>
  <text start="787.85" dur="3.179">writes off the debt we would like to</text>
  <text start="789.05" dur="4.11">write off the debt that means everyone</text>
  <text start="791.029" dur="4.381">is going to write off the debt and the</text>
  <text start="793.16" dur="5.1">central bankers they will not allow this</text>
  <text start="795.41" dur="7.02">to happen so they create these illusions</text>
  <text start="798.26" dur="7.13">and they make the system crash now with</text>
  <text start="802.43" dur="5.49">the crash it allows them to do</text>
  <text start="805.39" dur="4.11">extraordinary extraordinary things that</text>
  <text start="807.92" dur="6.63">they normally wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to do</text>
  <text start="809.5" dur="7.779">during a normal cycle and once it</text>
  <text start="814.55" dur="5.19">crashes this is when they can do other</text>
  <text start="817.279" dur="5.071">things like oh we need the funds to pay</text>
  <text start="819.74" dur="4.89">a lot of this debt let&amp;#39;s go into bank</text>
  <text start="822.35" dur="4.89">accounts oh wait we have a bail in</text>
  <text start="824.63" dur="4.889">document it just comes in so handy</text>
  <text start="827.24" dur="3.81">during these periods of time when we</text>
  <text start="829.519" dur="4.32">know there&amp;#39;s a lot of debt out there and</text>
  <text start="831.05" dur="4.83">we need to pay this debt down we will</text>
  <text start="833.839" dur="6.151">just use the people&amp;#39;s money to save the</text>
  <text start="835.88" dur="7.319">banks to pay the debt and basically fund</text>
  <text start="839.99" dur="5.4">the central bank&amp;#39;s operation that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="843.199" dur="5.191">that&amp;#39;s all about they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="845.39" dur="6.15">the people because they&amp;#39;re prepared and</text>
  <text start="848.39" dur="5.67">ready to take whatever they need to keep</text>
  <text start="851.54" dur="4.41">their system alive they never</text>
  <text start="854.06" dur="4.92">want you to see their system fail</text>
  <text start="855.95" dur="6.15">because if you see it fail or if someone</text>
  <text start="858.98" dur="6.66">writes off the debt their whole system</text>
  <text start="862.1" dur="4.98">comes tumbling down people say then why</text>
  <text start="865.64" dur="3.48">do we need all this data if we could</text>
  <text start="867.08" dur="4.86">just write it off they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="869.12" dur="6.51">to happen because their entire mission</text>
  <text start="871.94" dur="6.69">is to continually restart the same exact</text>
  <text start="875.63" dur="5.85">system but for start from scratch what</text>
  <text start="878.63" dur="5.19">did they do after World War two they</text>
  <text start="881.48" dur="4.23">started their system once again from</text>
  <text start="883.82" dur="3.96">scratch yes they call different names</text>
  <text start="885.71" dur="4.62">this is Bretton Woods is the petro</text>
  <text start="887.78" dur="4.17">dollar later on and they do this to make</text>
  <text start="890.33" dur="2.7">everyone think that something else is</text>
  <text start="891.95" dur="3.12">really happening but what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="893.03" dur="4.86">happening is they&amp;#39;re starting the system</text>
  <text start="895.07" dur="4.92">over and they let it go for a while they</text>
  <text start="897.89" dur="3.93">come off the gold standard and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="899.99" dur="3.78">back to where we are and then we have</text>
  <text start="901.82" dur="4.23">some type of war which covers up</text>
  <text start="903.77" dur="4.23">everything that we&amp;#39;ve seen and people</text>
  <text start="906.05" dur="4.35">forget about it and then they restarted</text>
  <text start="908" dur="6.27">once again and we&amp;#39;re at that point where</text>
  <text start="910.4" dur="5.82">they are ready to bring down the system</text>
  <text start="914.27" dur="3.75">they just need the event to go along</text>
  <text start="916.22" dur="3.69">with it they need a narrative to explain</text>
  <text start="918.02" dur="4.17">it away because they don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="919.91" dur="4.02">blamed for this and they&amp;#39;re prepared and</text>
  <text start="922.19" dur="3.78">ready to do this this is why you see all</text>
  <text start="923.93" dur="4.14">of this happening all at the same time</text>
  <text start="925.97" dur="5.1">this is why you see the interest rates</text>
  <text start="928.07" dur="5.34">being bumped up this is why you see the</text>
  <text start="931.07" dur="4.44">unwinding of the balance sheet this is</text>
  <text start="933.41" dur="4.47">why you see everything happening around</text>
  <text start="935.51" dur="4.56">the world all of this happening at the</text>
  <text start="937.88" dur="4.83">same time now a lot of people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="940.07" dur="4.5">stuck in this illusionary world they</text>
  <text start="942.71" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t want to look at you know things</text>
  <text start="944.57" dur="4.2">outside of the corporate media what</text>
  <text start="947.12" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re telling them what the central</text>
  <text start="948.77" dur="3.99">bank is saying they don&amp;#39;t want to see</text>
  <text start="950.72" dur="4.11">that oh maybe the economy&amp;#39;s in trouble</text>
  <text start="952.76" dur="3.78">they like living their lives where they</text>
  <text start="954.83" dur="3.81">use their credit cards they have their</text>
  <text start="956.54" dur="4.02">job they&amp;#39;re getting their paycheck and</text>
  <text start="958.64" dur="5.28">they really don&amp;#39;t care about anything</text>
  <text start="960.56" dur="5.37">else until they lose their job and they</text>
  <text start="963.92" dur="4.26">start to realize something&amp;#39;s wrong here</text>
  <text start="965.93" dur="3.84">or when they try to sell their house and</text>
  <text start="968.18" dur="3.78">they say what&amp;#39;s going on here where they</text>
  <text start="969.77" dur="4.05">lose their job before the collapse and</text>
  <text start="971.96" dur="4.35">they say how come I can&amp;#39;t find another</text>
  <text start="973.82" dur="5.52">job this is when people normally wake up</text>
