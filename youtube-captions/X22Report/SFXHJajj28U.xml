  <text start="99.96" dur="6.729">did not listen to the people they</text>
  <text start="103.78" dur="5.699">ignored the people and they went with a</text>
  <text start="106.689" dur="6.451">deal that was much much worse right now</text>
  <text start="109.479" dur="6.511">the ECB has raised Greece&amp;#39;s emergency</text>
  <text start="113.14" dur="7.92">liquidity assistance by 900 million</text>
  <text start="115.99" dur="7.589">euros for a week and I would say that</text>
  <text start="121.06" dur="4.5">the government now in Greece is probably</text>
  <text start="123.579" dur="4.741">going to be reshuffled because what</text>
  <text start="125.56" dur="6.42">we&amp;#39;re seeing is a lot of the syriza</text>
  <text start="128.32" dur="7.11">members about 32 of them voted no Vera</text>
  <text start="131.98" dur="4.77">Farkas he voted no and right now tsipras</text>
  <text start="135.43" dur="3.149">might be looking at this saying you know</text>
  <text start="136.75" dur="3.84">something we need to reshuffle we need</text>
  <text start="138.579" dur="6.991">to have elections we need to change</text>
  <text start="140.59" dur="8.13">things up here because right now this is</text>
  <text start="145.57" dur="7.11">a central bank puppet government we are</text>
  <text start="148.72" dur="8.16">back to where we started tsipras did</text>
  <text start="152.68" dur="7.019">nothing for the people as soon as the</text>
  <text start="156.88" dur="4.71">central bankers pushed him and</text>
  <text start="159.699" dur="5.141">threatened him and told him what to do</text>
  <text start="161.59" dur="6.38">he completely folded</text>
  <text start="164.84" dur="7.09">he did not work for the people like he</text>
  <text start="167.97" dur="6.09">promised and we can see most of the</text>
  <text start="171.93" dur="4.77">government officials or i should say</text>
  <text start="174.06" dur="5.67">government employees do this they fold</text>
  <text start="176.7" dur="4.289">iceland separate case they decided you</text>
  <text start="179.73" dur="3.539">know what we&amp;#39;re not going with the</text>
  <text start="180.989" dur="4.711">bankers were putting them in jail we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="183.269" dur="5.161">taking over our economy we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="185.7" dur="4.289">create our own money and this is why</text>
  <text start="188.43" dur="3.3">they keep it very quiet you don&amp;#39;t hate</text>
  <text start="189.989" dur="4.771">really hear anything about iceland in</text>
  <text start="191.73" dur="4.95">the corporate media now we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="194.76" dur="3.96">word that and this is coming from a</text>
  <text start="196.68" dur="4.77">greek senior banker that the banks are</text>
  <text start="198.72" dur="4.95">going to reopen monday since the</text>
  <text start="201.45" dur="4.74">austerity package went through in greece</text>
  <text start="203.67" dur="3.48">now they&amp;#39;ve told us this before they</text>
  <text start="206.19" dur="2.82">said they were going to open up this</text>
  <text start="207.15" dur="4.619">friday but i guess they canceled that</text>
  <text start="209.01" dur="4.5">already now they&amp;#39;re going to say monday</text>
  <text start="211.769" dur="3.361">but we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see if the</text>
  <text start="213.51" dur="4.05">banks actually open because i think the</text>
  <text start="215.13" dur="5.07">Greek people if they open these banks I</text>
  <text start="217.56" dur="5.1">think they&amp;#39;re gonna run to them and take</text>
  <text start="220.2" dur="5.069">out the rest of their money I know I</text>
  <text start="222.66" dur="4.189">would but what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is</text>
  <text start="225.269" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re trying to tell the people listen</text>
  <text start="226.849" dur="5.95">everything is fine now you should put</text>
  <text start="230.579" dur="5.991">your money back in the bank it&amp;#39;s safe</text>
  <text start="232.799" dur="6.481">there it&amp;#39;s okay you don&amp;#39;t have to worry</text>
  <text start="236.57" dur="4.979">saving account deposits you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="239.28" dur="5.91">earn about point two five percent in</text>
  <text start="241.549" dur="8.201">Greece so this is a good reason to put</text>
  <text start="245.19" dur="8.43">your money back in I mean go ahead and</text>
  <text start="249.75" dur="7.5">do it we&amp;#39;re gonna pay on interest on</text>
  <text start="253.62" dur="7.429">your money but again people are still</text>
  <text start="257.25" dur="7.71">nervous because this is not over yet I</text>
  <text start="261.049" dur="7.511">mean think about it the Greek people I</text>
  <text start="264.96" dur="5.91">suicide the Greek am a government voted</text>
  <text start="268.56" dur="5.85">on it and they said yes we&amp;#39;ll accept it</text>
  <text start="270.87" dur="7.44">but there&amp;#39;s still more steps that this</text>
  <text start="274.41" dur="6.36">has to go through Germany&amp;#39;s Parliament</text>
  <text start="278.31" dur="4.41">must issue a mandate giving Chancellor</text>
  <text start="280.77" dur="4.35">Angela Merkel the right to negotiate a</text>
  <text start="282.72" dur="4.29">new bailout deal with Greece finland&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.12" dur="4.71">the netherlands slovenia estonia and</text>
  <text start="287.01" dur="4.5">austria&amp;#39;s parliaments also must agree to</text>
  <text start="289.83" dur="4.14">let their finance ministers negotiate a</text>
  <text start="291.51" dur="5.13">new deal with greece EU finance</text>
  <text start="293.97" dur="4.22">ministers mustang negotiate the bailout</text>
  <text start="296.64" dur="3.44">deal with Greece</text>
  <text start="298.19" dur="6.69">Germany&amp;#39;s Parliament must sign off on</text>
  <text start="300.08" dur="7.62">the new deal so there is many different</text>
  <text start="304.88" dur="6.24">steps that still have to be taken here</text>
  <text start="307.7" dur="6.3">and it looks like the bailout itself is</text>
  <text start="311.12" dur="5.04">at least four weeks away assuming that</text>
  <text start="314" dur="4.19">all of these people agree on it and</text>
  <text start="316.16" dur="6.86">we&amp;#39;re already starting to hear that</text>
  <text start="318.19" dur="8.29">they&amp;#39;re not agreeing on this that maybe</text>
  <text start="323.02" dur="6.58">we aren&amp;#39;t going to give a bailout to</text>
  <text start="326.48" dur="5.22">Greece and we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch</text>
  <text start="329.6" dur="5.04">the situation very closely because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="331.7" dur="5.34">hearing from other people like david</text>
  <text start="334.64" dur="4.95">mcwilliams at ireland&amp;#39;s banking inquiry</text>
  <text start="337.04" dur="7.88">and he&amp;#39;s saying europe&amp;#39;s next recession</text>
  <text start="339.59" dur="9.65">will kill the euro that there one</text>
  <text start="344.92" dur="9.49">recession away from a major implosion in</text>
  <text start="349.24" dur="7.87">europe he believes that germany is out</text>
  <text start="354.41" dur="4.32">of control france is no longer strong</text>
  <text start="357.11" dur="4.56">enough to offer a counterweight and</text>
  <text start="358.73" dur="5.189">britain is happy to allow the circus to</text>
  <text start="361.67" dur="6.21">continue as they focus on potentially</text>
  <text start="363.919" dur="7.321">getting out of the EU and all these</text>
  <text start="367.88" dur="5.16">people who are continually saying that</text>
  <text start="371.24" dur="7.05">we&amp;#39;re in a recovery that everything is</text>
  <text start="373.04" dur="9.09">fine no how can this possibly be Greece</text>
  <text start="378.29" dur="7.41">is going to be put into more debt they</text>
  <text start="382.13" dur="8.15">have no plan to grow the economy there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="385.7" dur="8.01">nothing in there to grow the economy I</text>
  <text start="390.28" dur="5.47">mean look at France look at Portugal</text>
  <text start="393.71" dur="5.7">look at Italy are their economies</text>
  <text start="395.75" dur="8.97">growing our people going back to work no</text>
  <text start="399.41" dur="8.31">they are not and we&amp;#39;re seeing that this</text>
  <text start="404.72" dur="6.18">whole thing can fall apart with a snap</text>
  <text start="407.72" dur="4.56">of a finger and we are approaching that</text>
  <text start="410.9" dur="5.6">because they&amp;#39;re doing everything they</text>
  <text start="412.28" dur="8.55">possibly can to keep this system running</text>
  <text start="416.5" dur="6.37">we see out in the UK a report came out</text>
  <text start="420.83" dur="5.1">living standards poverty and inequality</text>
  <text start="422.87" dur="6.419">in the UK 2015 and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="425.93" dur="5.759">even as the parents are working in the</text>
  <text start="429.289" dur="6.3">UK guess what</text>
  <text start="431.689" dur="7.98">children are still in poverty even with</text>
  <text start="435.589" dur="7.23">working families and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="439.669" dur="5.16">interesting about this is that the</text>
  <text start="442.819" dur="5.31">numbers of children living in absolute</text>
  <text start="444.829" dur="5.64">poverty remained unchanged between 2009</text>
  <text start="448.129" dur="4.65">2010 and twenty thirteen to twenty</text>
  <text start="450.469" dur="3.81">fourteen however the proportion of kids</text>
  <text start="452.779" dur="5.93">living in poverty whose parents work</text>
  <text start="454.279" dur="9.69">rose by nine percent over this period</text>
  <text start="458.709" dur="7.63">this is a dramatic rise and people are</text>
  <text start="463.969" dur="4.47">working and they still can&amp;#39;t make it</text>
  <text start="466.339" dur="3.211">we&amp;#39;re seeing this in many of the</text>
  <text start="468.439" dur="3.6">countries we&amp;#39;re seeing it here in the</text>
  <text start="469.55" dur="5.339">United States people are working and</text>
  <text start="472.039" dur="6.36">they cannot make ends meet it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="474.889" dur="5.37">tougher and tougher and as you retire</text>
  <text start="478.399" dur="4.82">it&amp;#39;s even worse because you&amp;#39;re on a</text>
  <text start="480.259" dur="7.47">fixed income and prices of food</text>
  <text start="483.219" dur="6.19">electricity fuel continually rise and</text>
  <text start="487.729" dur="5.79">this is why we see the older generation</text>
  <text start="489.409" dur="6.09">going out and getting jobs we see in the</text>
  <text start="493.519" dur="5.82">eurozone the economic sentiment has</text>
  <text start="495.499" dur="6.361">declined the zew center for European</text>
  <text start="499.339" dur="6.57">Economic Research said that yeah the</text>
  <text start="501.86" dur="7.099">eurozone fell once again and it dipped</text>
  <text start="505.909" dur="5.66">by 11 points over the previous month</text>
  <text start="508.959" dur="7.57">people are looking at this thing yeah</text>
  <text start="511.569" dur="8.681">this doesn&amp;#39;t feel good something is</text>
  <text start="516.529" dur="6.75">wrong we haven&amp;#39;t had jobs in who knows</text>
  <text start="520.25" dur="4.529">how long we know the consumer confidence</text>
  <text start="523.279" dur="3.36">we know the confidence here in the</text>
  <text start="524.779" dur="3.091">United States is continually falling</text>
  <text start="526.639" dur="2.731">also people are saying you know</text>
  <text start="527.87" dur="5.399">something something&amp;#39;s wrong with the</text>
  <text start="529.37" dur="6.63">economy I just lost my job I can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="533.269" dur="5.61">a job or I can only get this part time</text>
  <text start="536" dur="6.889">job or I found a job and I&amp;#39;m making a</text>
  <text start="538.879" dur="7.171">lot less than i did doing the same work</text>
  <text start="542.889" dur="6.82">but of course the government is trying</text>
  <text start="546.05" dur="6.149">to trick us trying to keep us in the</text>
  <text start="549.709" dur="4.411">dark and they keep manipulating all the</text>
  <text start="552.199" dur="3.721">numbers I mean we know what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="554.12" dur="5.159">here and they keep telling us that the</text>
  <text start="555.92" dur="7.589">initial jobless claims is continually</text>
  <text start="559.279" dur="6.071">declining people have jobs they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="563.509" dur="4.261">putting in the claims</text>
  <text start="565.35" dur="4.47">well again all they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="567.77" dur="3.88">manipulating all these numbers you have</text>
  <text start="569.82" dur="5.31">to remember when you have a part-time</text>
  <text start="571.65" dur="5.64">job you look working in retail yes when</text>
  <text start="575.13" dur="5.73">they look at the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="577.29" dur="5.46">you&amp;#39;re working part-time you have a</text>
  <text start="580.86" dur="4.68">full-time job your account it is full</text>
  <text start="582.75" dur="5.43">time if you lose that job and you</text>
  <text start="585.54" dur="5.76">haven&amp;#39;t worked a certain number of hours</text>
  <text start="588.18" dur="7.59">or made a certain number of dollars you</text>
  <text start="591.3" dur="8.58">can&amp;#39;t apply for unemployment and this is</text>
  <text start="595.77" dur="6.18">a huge problem because what it does is</text>
  <text start="599.88" dur="6.42">it skews the results and this is what</text>
  <text start="601.95" dur="7.35">we&amp;#39;re seeing and we&amp;#39;ve just had the</text>
  <text start="606.3" dur="4.68">corporate companies the corporate the</text>
  <text start="609.3" dur="7.49">corporation&amp;#39;s come out and tell us that</text>
  <text start="610.98" dur="9.54">yeah we&amp;#39;re laying off 10,000 15,000</text>
  <text start="616.79" dur="5.53">20,000 and you&amp;#39;re trying to tell me that</text>
  <text start="620.52" dur="6">the initial jobless claims continually</text>
  <text start="622.32" dur="6.59">falls it&amp;#39;s not ticking up whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="626.52" dur="4.34">every time it does take up it falls</text>
  <text start="628.91" dur="6.64">dramatically and this is how you know</text>
  <text start="630.86" dur="6.88">something is being manipulated we see</text>
  <text start="635.55" dur="5.73">the Philly Fed has plunged back to the</text>
  <text start="637.74" dur="6.63">lows of the year printing at 5.7 missing</text>
  <text start="641.28" dur="7.47">expectations of 12 this is the biggest</text>
  <text start="644.37" dur="9.57">myths since January it appears the</text>
  <text start="648.75" dur="7.26">weakness in q1 q2 q2 and q3 I guess it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="653.94" dur="4.29">more than just the weather or the port</text>
  <text start="656.01" dur="4.35">closures I guess we&amp;#39;re having some type</text>
  <text start="658.23" dur="4.92">of major problem in the economy but</text>
  <text start="660.36" dur="4.89">again the government&amp;#39;s not going to talk</text>
  <text start="663.15" dur="4.8">about this they&amp;#39;re not going to tell you</text>
  <text start="665.25" dur="6.39">that it&amp;#39;s the economy they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="667.95" dur="7.2">blame everything else of why this is</text>
  <text start="671.64" dur="6.59">happening until the economy completely</text>
  <text start="675.15" dur="6.57">collapse and then they have to admit it</text>
  <text start="678.23" dur="5.95">we understand that retail sales have</text>
  <text start="681.72" dur="4.29">completely flopped just a month or two</text>
  <text start="684.18" dur="5.76">ago they told us oh we&amp;#39;re in a recovery</text>
  <text start="686.01" dur="5.61">retail sales have shot up but we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="689.94" dur="5.6">shown that yeah that&amp;#39;s not why retail</text>
  <text start="691.62" dur="7.62">shell sales have shot up when you remove</text>
  <text start="695.54" dur="5.68">fuel and you remove everything</text>
  <text start="699.24" dur="4.77">we see retail sales completely have</text>
  <text start="701.22" dur="4.89">fallen apart and if the economy is</text>
  <text start="704.01" dur="4.53">indeed improving the retail sale sales</text>
  <text start="706.11" dur="6.74">should be improving as the economy</text>
  <text start="708.54" dur="6.78">improves conversely a weakening economy</text>
  <text start="712.85" dur="5.14">environment will be revealed by a</text>
  <text start="715.32" dur="4.26">declining trend in retail sales this is</text>
  <text start="717.99" dur="4.62">particularly the case in the US economy</text>
  <text start="719.58" dur="5.699">where consumption comprises nearly of</text>

  <text start="1712.89" dur="3.51">we see they are definitely getting ready</text>

  <text start="1729.66" dur="6.27">Army political representatives that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1733.23" dur="4.14">still in place and we understand the</text>

  <text start="1737.37" dur="4.98">the United States government Israel and</text>
  <text start="1738.75" dur="7.47">other nations they have cleared the path</text>
  <text start="1742.35" dur="6.81">in Syria they&amp;#39;ve taken over a huge swath</text>

  <text start="1749.16" dur="4.8">there&amp;#39;s they want to create safe zones</text>
  <text start="1750.36" dur="5.16">in this area now in these zones the Free</text>
  <text start="1753.96" dur="5.49">Syrian Army has already come out and</text>
  <text start="1755.52" dur="10.25">said listen we are going to substitute</text>
  <text start="1759.45" dur="10.07">the syrian pound for the turkish lira</text>
  <text start="1765.77" dur="6.27">so they&amp;#39;re already making a currency</text>
  <text start="1769.52" dur="7.98">swap saying that yeah the Turkish I mean</text>
  <text start="1772.04" dur="10.17">the syrian pound is not doing well under</text>
  <text start="1777.5" dur="6.93">the Assad regime the currency is falling</text>
  <text start="1782.21" dur="3.93">and it needs to be replaced so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1784.43" dur="5.73">going to do that in all the areas that</text>
  <text start="1786.14" dur="7.23">we are holding right now well if that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1790.16" dur="6.6">the case why is the Ukrainian currency</text>
  <text start="1793.37" dur="7.08">still in existence because that currency</text>
  <text start="1796.76" dur="6.9">is imploding what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="1800.45" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;re preparing these areas to be</text>
  <text start="1803.66" dur="5.61">separate and apart from Syria they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1806.48" dur="6.18">taking it one step at a time take over</text>
  <text start="1809.27" dur="7.29">the areas make them safe zones change</text>
  <text start="1812.66" dur="6.63">the currency put up a government in</text>
  <text start="1816.56" dur="6.51">these areas call it by a different name</text>
  <text start="1819.29" dur="7.05">and we can see the propaganda is running</text>
  <text start="1823.07" dur="7.35">wild right now I saw a headline saying</text>
  <text start="1826.34" dur="8.27">that asad&amp;#39;s bombing of civilians is to</text>
  <text start="1830.42" dur="6.75">turn them against the Free Syrian Army</text>
  <text start="1834.61" dur="5.53">so basically what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="1837.17" dur="5.04">Assad is killing his own people so</text>
  <text start="1840.14" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;ll go fight the Free Syrian Army</text>
  <text start="1842.21" dur="7.65">and the Islamic state does that make any</text>
  <text start="1844.1" dur="9.27">sense whatsoever it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="1849.86" dur="6.66">because why would he bomb his own people</text>
  <text start="1853.37" dur="6.24">the people would turn against him these</text>
  <text start="1856.52" dur="6.03">are the people that elected him he had</text>
  <text start="1859.61" dur="4.86">an overwhelming majority who came out</text>
  <text start="1862.55" dur="6.24">and said yes we want him as president</text>
  <text start="1864.47" dur="6.33">and it makes no sense for him to go and</text>
  <text start="1868.79" dur="4.17">bomb his own people it would make more</text>
  <text start="1870.8" dur="5.67">sense for the Free Syrian Army to bomb</text>
  <text start="1872.96" dur="5.91">those people who support Assad and this</text>
  <text start="1876.47" dur="4.86">is what we&amp;#39;re seeing they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="1878.87" dur="8.21">propaganda they&amp;#39;re trying to build up</text>
  <text start="1881.33" dur="9.47">the case of human rights violations</text>
  <text start="1887.08" dur="6.7">Assad using bombs on his own people</text>
  <text start="1890.8" dur="5.05">they&amp;#39;re showing pictures to Congress now</text>
  <text start="1893.78" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince you that is</text>
  <text start="1895.85" dur="5.49">using chlorine gas they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="1898.82" dur="5.43">everything they possibly can to build</text>
  <text start="1901.34" dur="6.809">the propaganda up that he&amp;#39;s a bad bad</text>
  <text start="1904.25" dur="8.009">person and we need to remove him this is</text>
  <text start="1908.149" dur="6.9">what we are seeing right now because as</text>
  <text start="1912.259" dur="6.091">we know they&amp;#39;re getting ready to make</text>
  <text start="1915.049" dur="7.291">their move now we understand that Jade</text>
  <text start="1918.35" dur="5.73">helm is in full swing right now we</text>
  <text start="1922.34" dur="4.02">understand there are certain states in</text>
  <text start="1924.08" dur="4.65">the South moving out to the west they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1926.36" dur="5.97">involved in this but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1928.73" dur="7.649">interesting about this is that one of</text>
  <text start="1932.33" dur="7.349">their missions is going to be conducted</text>
  <text start="1936.379" dur="5.821">at a power center in the mountains</text>
  <text start="1939.679" dur="4.641">between California and Nevada there will</text>
  <text start="1942.2" dur="5.52">be practicing surveillance techniques</text>
  <text start="1944.32" dur="8.89">defensive operations and even sabotage</text>
  <text start="1947.72" dur="8.579">operations of power stations and how to</text>
  <text start="1953.21" dur="8.01">keep control of the population in these</text>
  <text start="1956.299" dur="8.46">areas of when the power goes out now we</text>
  <text start="1961.22" dur="7.319">understand and we&amp;#39;ve talked about this</text>
  <text start="1964.759" dur="6.27">quite often that eventually they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1968.539" dur="5.88">going to bring down the grid I believe</text>
  <text start="1971.029" dur="6.541">back in 2003 when we had that power</text>
  <text start="1974.419" dur="4.411">outage on the East Coast that was a test</text>
  <text start="1977.57" dur="3.18">case scenario to see how the people</text>
  <text start="1978.83" dur="6.199">reacted to see if they could do it and</text>
  <text start="1980.75" dur="8.1">they were able to do it and then we saw</text>
  <text start="1985.029" dur="5.321">something occur in California where they</text>
  <text start="1988.85" dur="5.809">attack i think was california they</text>
  <text start="1990.35" dur="9.63">attacked a power station our men and</text>
  <text start="1994.659" dur="10.63">then out in California we also had fiber</text>
  <text start="1999.98" dur="8.61">cables cut they also had drills with</text>
  <text start="2005.289" dur="5.13">cyber attacks hitting the power</text>
  <text start="2008.59" dur="3.719">infrastructure and we know there&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2010.419" dur="4.951">nine points around the country if they</text>
  <text start="2012.309" dur="5">hit them the entire system comes down no</text>
  <text start="2015.37" dur="4.919">I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re going to hit each</text>
  <text start="2017.309" dur="5.95">one I think they&amp;#39;re going to pick</text>
  <text start="2020.289" dur="6.421">selected areas because when this event</text>
  <text start="2023.259" dur="4.981">occurs I think what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="2026.71" dur="5.849">here we&amp;#39;re going to see different things</text>
  <text start="2028.24" dur="8.96">occurring power outages in certain areas</text>
  <text start="2032.559" dur="7.771">other physical destruction and cities</text>
  <text start="2037.2" dur="6.4">where they can say oh yes it was a dirty</text>

  <text start="2043.6" dur="5.549">biological weapon whatever they want to</text>
  <text start="2045.58" dur="5.999">call it and I think they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="2049.149" dur="6.121">this in multiple places at varying times</text>
  <text start="2051.579" dur="7.891">to bring the whole country together to</text>
  <text start="2055.27" dur="6.559">fight the common enemy and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2059.47" dur="5.459">very odd how this is all happening now</text>
  <text start="2061.829" dur="6.641">the press is not allowed to be involved</text>

  <text start="2068.47" dur="5.82">to be involved and they were rejected</text>
  <text start="2070.629" dur="5.881">and a lot of people say this is being</text>
  <text start="2074.29" dur="3.809">done from july-to-september and many</text>
  <text start="2076.51" dur="4.53">others are saying now it&amp;#39;s been extended</text>
  <text start="2078.099" dur="6.451">to November which is very interesting</text>
  <text start="2081.04" dur="5.279">and we understand why this has all</text>
