  <text start="224.99" dur="6.719">get their way the brexit will happen and</text>
  <text start="228.83" dur="4.92">the EU will be standing there wondering</text>
  <text start="231.709" dur="3.301">what just happened we had this</text>
  <text start="233.75" dur="4.31">incredible deal that was going to</text>
  <text start="235.01" dur="7.86">benefit us and now we have no deal and</text>
  <text start="238.06" dur="6.7">the brexit actually happened now again</text>
  <text start="242.87" dur="4.47">the central bank to you they might try</text>
  <text start="244.76" dur="5.01">something remember they use fear they</text>
  <text start="247.34" dur="6.84">use events and this is something that we</text>
  <text start="249.77" dur="6.66">need to look at but once the UK actually</text>
  <text start="254.18" dur="4.86">leaves do you think other countries are</text>
  <text start="256.43" dur="5.369">gonna say you know something we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="259.04" dur="5.82">follow what the UK did Italy might do it</text>

  <text start="264.86" dur="5.4">should I say when she wins against</text>
  <text start="267.86" dur="5.7">McCrone maybe friends will do it</text>
  <text start="270.26" dur="6.06">same thing with Germany and all of a</text>
  <text start="273.56" dur="7.65">sudden these non elected leaders their</text>
  <text start="276.32" dur="7.23">leaders of nothing and this is how a</text>
  <text start="281.21" dur="5.22">movement starts now here in the United</text>
  <text start="283.55" dur="5.4">States this central bank system that</text>
  <text start="286.43" dur="5.73">were in it is collapsing very very</text>
  <text start="288.95" dur="5.52">quickly and again we need to make a</text>
  <text start="292.16" dur="4.29">distinction there is a central bank</text>
  <text start="294.47" dur="3">economy which has been established since</text>
  <text start="296.45" dur="4.11">1913</text>
  <text start="297.47" dur="5.67">then in 1940 they change it over with</text>
  <text start="300.56" dur="5.25">Bretton Woods then in 1971 they change</text>
  <text start="303.14" dur="5.97">it over with the petrodollar here we are</text>
  <text start="305.81" dur="6.54">at the end stage of the 1971 petro</text>
  <text start="309.11" dur="5.97">dollar central bank system where they</text>
  <text start="312.35" dur="4.89">can create as much fiat currency as they</text>
  <text start="315.08" dur="6.42">want and the government can borrow as</text>
  <text start="317.24" dur="7.41">much as they want the whole thing cannot</text>
  <text start="321.5" dur="6.32">be sustained Trump of the Patriots</text>
  <text start="324.65" dur="6.69">they&amp;#39;re working on another economy</text>
  <text start="327.82" dur="6.67">another economy which is now in the</text>
  <text start="331.34" dur="5.75">works of being developed but when we</text>
  <text start="334.49" dur="4.83">look at the central bank economy</text>
  <text start="337.09" dur="4.45">everything is falling apart and Trump</text>
  <text start="339.32" dur="5.25">and the Patriots they know they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="341.54" dur="4.02">allow the central bank system to fall</text>
  <text start="344.57" dur="3.3">apart why do you think they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="345.56" dur="3.84">pumping up the stock market why do you</text>
  <text start="347.87" dur="3.62">think they&amp;#39;re continuing with the</text>
  <text start="349.4" dur="4.22">manipulation of all these numbers</text>
  <text start="351.49" dur="6.88">because they need to keep this</text>
  <text start="353.62" dur="8.65">operational long enough to move to a new</text>
  <text start="358.37" dur="7.2">system now when we look at some of the</text>
  <text start="362.27" dur="4.98">indicators they are just horrible if we</text>
  <text start="365.57" dur="5.01">look at housing we and we look at</text>
  <text start="367.25" dur="6.36">housing quite a bit the housing market</text>
  <text start="370.58" dur="5.19">is declining even with interest rates</text>
  <text start="373.61" dur="4.26">declining right now we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="375.77" dur="4.89">building permits they have plunged most</text>
  <text start="377.87" dur="6.78">in three years despite the rates falling</text>
  <text start="380.66" dur="6.54">which means the rates haven&amp;#39;t come down</text>
  <text start="384.65" dur="8.04">enough I don&amp;#39;t know if you remember back</text>
  <text start="387.2" dur="7.98">in 2008-2009 but at that time I was</text>
  <text start="392.69" dur="4.62">selling the home and all these realtors</text>
  <text start="395.18" dur="3.87">were coming out and they were telling me</text>
  <text start="397.31" dur="3">oh you have to do this you have to do</text>
  <text start="399.05" dur="3.54">that they didn&amp;#39;t understand the market</text>
  <text start="400.31" dur="3.78">and then I decided to look at the market</text>
  <text start="402.59" dur="2.579">and say all right what is going on here</text>
  <text start="404.09" dur="4.65">which houses are selling which</text>
  <text start="405.169" dur="5.491">warehouses aren&amp;#39;t selling well I noticed</text>
  <text start="408.74" dur="4.38">houses that are two hundred three</text>
  <text start="410.66" dur="5.759">hundred four hundred thousand those were</text>
  <text start="413.12" dur="8.28">selling anything above that they were</text>
  <text start="416.419" dur="7.321">not selling so the strategy was to come</text>
  <text start="421.4" dur="4.32">below those numbers even if it was a</text>
  <text start="423.74" dur="4.59">short sale you needed to be below that</text>
  <text start="425.72" dur="4.05">number to even get people interested in</text>
  <text start="428.33" dur="3.929">the home</text>
  <text start="429.77" dur="5.01">why do I say this why am i giving this</text>
  <text start="432.259" dur="6.871">example it&amp;#39;s the same thing with people</text>
  <text start="434.78" dur="5.819">looking to get a mortgage yes the</text>
  <text start="439.13" dur="4.319">interest rate might be four point five</text>
  <text start="440.599" dur="5.521">four point seven but for these people to</text>
  <text start="443.449" dur="5.101">get into the market it has to drop below</text>
  <text start="446.12" dur="5.729">a certain number now Trump and the</text>
  <text start="448.55" dur="5.19">Patriots they know this they know that</text>
  <text start="451.849" dur="5.761">they&amp;#39;re going to have to drop these</text>
  <text start="453.74" dur="5.519">rates quite a bit to get to this magical</text>
  <text start="457.61" dur="3.839">number where people say you know</text>
  <text start="459.259" dur="4.351">something I&amp;#39;m in the market now now I</text>
  <text start="461.449" dur="4.021">can go ahead and I can purchase a home</text>
  <text start="463.61" dur="4.799">now I can go ahead and purchase this</text>
  <text start="465.47" dur="5.97">automobile now I can go ahead and do</text>
  <text start="468.409" dur="4.711">whatever I need to do and this is why</text>
  <text start="471.44" dur="6.9">Trump and the Patriots are out there</text>
  <text start="473.12" dur="7.109">pushing rate cuts pushing stimulus is it</text>
  <text start="478.34" dur="5.4">going to make the economy all better</text>
  <text start="480.229" dur="6.03">no the point of all this is to keep the</text>
  <text start="483.74" dur="5.31">economy going long enough for Trump to</text>
  <text start="486.259" dur="7.641">win the election that&amp;#39;s it because if</text>
  <text start="489.05" dur="9.119">the economy implodes collapses before</text>
  <text start="493.9" dur="6.04">2020 Trump will be blamed what do you</text>
  <text start="498.169" dur="5.151">think the mainstream media is going to</text>
  <text start="499.94" dur="5.849">do they&amp;#39;re going to attack him all the</text>
  <text start="503.32" dur="3.819">Democratic candidates they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="505.789" dur="4.171">attack him he knows this</text>
  <text start="507.139" dur="5.911">the Patriots know this and this is why</text>
  <text start="509.96" dur="6.269">he is asking for rate cuts and stimulus</text>
  <text start="513.05" dur="6.299">just to keep this central bank system</text>
  <text start="516.229" dur="6.451">which is imploding alive long enough</text>
  <text start="519.349" dur="6.211">keep it on life support long enough for</text>
  <text start="522.68" dur="6.57">him to win the election that is it this</text>
  <text start="525.56" dur="6.54">you can&amp;#39;t fix this system you have to</text>
  <text start="529.25" dur="5.7">throw it out and bring in a system that</text>
  <text start="532.1" dur="6.51">actually works now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="534.95" dur="5.73">interesting is that Powell is out there</text>
  <text start="538.61" dur="6.03">and he is saying that they&amp;#39;re ready to</text>
  <text start="540.68" dur="6.18">cut rates and the mainstream media they</text>
  <text start="544.64" dur="4.86">are scratching their head and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="546.86" dur="6.479">trying to figure out why in the world</text>
  <text start="549.5" dur="5.54">would the Fed cut rates right now this</text>
  <text start="553.339" dur="5.271">is coming out of the Wall Street Journal</text>
  <text start="555.04" dur="6.25">Fed rate cut plans stop making sense</text>
  <text start="558.61" dur="4.87">latest economic data don&amp;#39;t show a need</text>
  <text start="561.29" dur="4.14">for a monetary stimulus from the</text>
  <text start="563.48" dur="4.109">Federal Reserve the facts have changed</text>
  <text start="565.43" dur="3.99">but the Federal Reserve sure doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="567.589" dur="4.321">seem like it is changing its mind</text>
  <text start="569.42" dur="6.75">the feds reasons for cutting rates have</text>
  <text start="571.91" dur="6.359">become less and less compelling there is</text>
  <text start="576.17" dur="6.21">no reason why the Fed should cut rates</text>
  <text start="578.269" dur="8.82">except one to keep the entire economic</text>
  <text start="582.38" dur="7.61">system chugging along long enough for</text>
  <text start="587.089" dur="5.731">Trump to win the election that&amp;#39;s it I</text>
  <text start="589.99" dur="5.77">mean the economic data would tell you to</text>
  <text start="592.82" dur="6.569">raise rates that tells you who&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="595.76" dur="6.05">control now what&amp;#39;s very interesting and</text>
  <text start="599.389" dur="5.581">we&amp;#39;ve been saying this for quite a while</text>
  <text start="601.81" dur="8.95">Trump has been baiting the central bank</text>
  <text start="604.97" dur="9.15">especially IMF and the IMF has taken the</text>
  <text start="610.76" dur="5.189">bait and they&amp;#39;re warning that the global</text>
  <text start="614.12" dur="4.2">economies will contract by four hundred</text>
  <text start="615.949" dur="5.19">and fifty five billion next year due to</text>
  <text start="618.32" dur="6.509">the ongoing trade conflict between the</text>
  <text start="621.139" dur="5.461">US and China think about that for a</text>
  <text start="624.829" dur="4.32">second because of what is happening</text>
  <text start="626.6" dur="9.33">between the US and China the entire</text>
  <text start="629.149" dur="12.99">world is going to contract now Trump the</text>
  <text start="635.93" dur="10.11">Patriots they&amp;#39;ve baited the IMF why well</text>
  <text start="642.139" dur="5.611">number one we know that Trump and the</text>
  <text start="646.04" dur="4.349">Patriots they&amp;#39;re going to make a trade</text>
  <text start="647.75" dur="3.24">deal with China now are they gonna make</text>
  <text start="650.389" dur="2.731">it today</text>
  <text start="650.99" dur="3.24">most likely not will they make it by the</text>
  <text start="653.12" dur="2.61">end of the year maybe</text>
  <text start="654.23" dur="3.839">will they make it by the beginning of</text>
  <text start="655.73" dur="4.859">the year well I think the percentages</text>
  <text start="658.069" dur="6.241">are getting higher and higher as we move</text>
  <text start="660.589" dur="8.671">to 2020 but we need to think about what</text>
  <text start="664.31" dur="7.56">the IMF is saying is the global economy</text>
  <text start="669.26" dur="5.309">really contracting and they gave a</text>
  <text start="671.87" dur="3.659">number 435 billion that&amp;#39;s probably more</text>
  <text start="674.569" dur="3.45">or less it doesn&amp;#39;t really make a</text>
  <text start="675.529" dur="7.411">difference at this point what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="678.019" dur="5.87">telling you is that Trump by doing what</text>
  <text start="682.94" dur="6.75">he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="683.889" dur="10.031">removing the globalist trade deals it is</text>
  <text start="689.69" dur="7.68">costing the central bank&amp;#39;s billions and</text>
  <text start="693.92" dur="7.05">billions of dollars where is the</text>
  <text start="697.37" dur="10.91">money going to the United States of</text>
  <text start="700.97" dur="11.79">course remember Trump is unravelling</text>
  <text start="708.28" dur="8.02">dismantling the globalist trade system</text>
  <text start="712.76" dur="6.15">and all those funds that were flown away</text>
  <text start="716.3" dur="7.1">from the United States are now coming</text>
  <text start="718.91" dur="8">back pulling it out of the central bank</text>
  <text start="723.4" dur="7.84">economy helping the United States</text>
  <text start="726.91" dur="8.29">bringing it all back here so what is he</text>
  <text start="731.24" dur="8.1">really doing he&amp;#39;s reversing the IMF</text>
  <text start="735.2" dur="6.66">trade wealth distribution model now</text>
