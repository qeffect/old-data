  <text start="40.67" dur="6.88">Yemen let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="44.94" dur="5.25">collapses that we understand that Greece</text>
  <text start="47.55" dur="5.099">has many payments coming due and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="50.19" dur="4.92">scrounging around for cash to make these</text>
  <text start="52.649" dur="4.711">payments we also understand that the</text>
  <text start="55.11" dur="6.06">eurozone it seems like they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="57.36" dur="7.86">prepared for Greece to exit the eurozone</text>
  <text start="61.17" dur="6.39">and pivot towards Russia and we see</text>
  <text start="65.22" dur="6.48">Europe as we reported yesterday was</text>
  <text start="67.56" dur="6.18">maybe going to file an antitrust charge</text>

  <text start="79.14" dur="4.83">Gazprom investigation which began around</text>
  <text start="81.57" dur="3.99">two and a half years ago had been moving</text>
  <text start="83.97" dur="4.079">toward a settlement and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="85.56" dur="5.82">we had the Ukraine situation everything</text>
  <text start="88.049" dur="5.07">stalled and here we are today and we can</text>
  <text start="91.38" dur="3.419">see the reason why they&amp;#39;re bringing this</text>
  <text start="93.119" dur="5.011">up at this point in time is because</text>
  <text start="94.799" dur="6.061">Gazprom is making a deal with Greece to</text>
  <text start="98.13" dur="4.89">build that pipeline and they do not want</text>
  <text start="100.86" dur="3.98">this whatsoever and here&amp;#39;s the official</text>
  <text start="103.02" dur="4.65">statement from the European Commission</text>
  <text start="104.84" dur="5.29">Commission sends statement of objections</text>

  <text start="120.03" dur="4.949">competition watchdog to start an</text>
  <text start="122.34" dur="4.8">antitrust probe against Russia&amp;#39;s giant</text>
  <text start="124.979" dur="3.931">gas prom and this is coming from yachts</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="4.05">and yuck and we can see they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="128.91" dur="4.53">jumping on the bandwagon going after</text>
  <text start="131.19" dur="2.62">Russia because of what is happening of</text>
  <text start="133.44" dur="2.019">course</text>
  <text start="133.81" dur="4.2">Ukraine doesn&amp;#39;t want to pay their bill</text>
  <text start="135.459" dur="4.441">which they owe to gas problem and the</text>
  <text start="138.01" dur="4.62">eurozone right now is looking at the</text>
  <text start="139.9" dur="6.809">situation and saying well we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="142.63" dur="6.81">this to happen we need to file this to</text>
  <text start="146.709" dur="6.411">see if we can slow this down and we can</text>
  <text start="149.44" dur="7.53">see at this point in time that Greece</text>
  <text start="153.12" dur="7.6">really has no way out of this and we see</text>
  <text start="156.97" dur="6.5">the ECB right now is preparing to saks</text>
  <text start="160.72" dur="7.739">to sacrifice Greek banks with a</text>
  <text start="163.47" dur="7.21">50-percent collateral haircut with the</text>
  <text start="168.459" dur="4.351">value of the collateral being we do so</text>
  <text start="170.68" dur="4.91">significantly banks will be hard-pressed</text>
  <text start="172.81" dur="5.73">to obtain the money they need to survive</text>
  <text start="175.59" dur="5.649">Greece&amp;#39;s largest banks have been forced</text>
  <text start="178.54" dur="5.49">to borrow short-term at higher interest</text>
  <text start="181.239" dur="5.491">money from their central bank the banks</text>
  <text start="184.03" dur="4.769">in turn have to provide adequate</text>
  <text start="186.73" dur="6.509">collateral to obtain these loans which</text>
  <text start="188.799" dur="5.97">now stand at 74 billion euros but as we</text>
  <text start="193.239" dur="3.08">know the people inside Greece they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="194.769" dur="4.771">taking their money out of the banks</text>
  <text start="196.319" dur="5.95">they&amp;#39;re fleeing the system because they</text>
  <text start="199.54" dur="7.05">know what&amp;#39;s coming they&amp;#39;ve seen it</text>
  <text start="202.269" dur="6.871">before with Cyprus where all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="206.59" dur="5.7">the banks go on bank holidays and they</text>
  <text start="209.14" dur="7.56">implement balance and we can see that</text>
  <text start="212.29" dur="6.93">Greece is going down that path and the</text>
  <text start="216.7" dur="4.409">people in Greece might be Cyprus and</text>
  <text start="219.22" dur="5.099">this might be coming very soon now if</text>
  <text start="221.109" dur="5.13">they don&amp;#39;t get help from Russia if they</text>
  <text start="224.319" dur="6.29">do not get it or make a deal with the</text>
  <text start="226.239" dur="7.921">ECB we can see this scenario playing out</text>
  <text start="230.609" dur="5.231">where there&amp;#39;s another Balin the people</text>
  <text start="234.16" dur="3.6">are locked out of their accounts and we</text>
  <text start="235.84" dur="4.76">have to remember back when this happened</text>
  <text start="237.76" dur="5.009">to Cyprus this went on for over a year</text>
  <text start="240.6" dur="6.19">where people could only take out a</text>
  <text start="242.769" dur="6.78">certain number of dollars every single</text>
  <text start="246.79" dur="4.86">month actually it&amp;#39;s not dollars it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="249.549" dur="4.111">their currency and they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="251.65" dur="5.55">transfer the money outside of the bank</text>
  <text start="253.66" dur="6.15">and these capital controls stayed in</text>
  <text start="257.2" dur="4.56">effect for over a year and you have to</text>
  <text start="259.81" dur="5.37">remember they went to sleep on a Friday</text>
  <text start="261.76" dur="4.89">and they woke up Saturday to a bank</text>
  <text start="265.18" dur="5.37">holiday this is</text>
  <text start="266.65" dur="5.46">how quickly it happens we see in the</text>
  <text start="270.55" dur="3.81">eurozone they&amp;#39;re continually telling us</text>
  <text start="272.11" dur="6.57">that yes everything is improving</text>
  <text start="274.36" dur="7.41">everything&amp;#39;s getting better and really</text>
  <text start="278.68" dur="6.51">it isn&amp;#39;t we see the eurozone consumer</text>
  <text start="281.77" dur="6.69">confidence fell by negative 4.6 in April</text>
  <text start="285.19" dur="5.099">of course the expectations were supposed</text>
  <text start="288.46" dur="2.97">to be much much higher because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="290.289" dur="2.551">trying to convince the people that</text>
  <text start="291.43" dur="3.12">things are getting better there but when</text>
  <text start="292.84" dur="4.44">we look at all the difference in the</text>
  <text start="294.55" dur="5.489">eurozone we see a lot of them are in a</text>
  <text start="297.28" dur="5.009">depression a lot of them are in a deep</text>
  <text start="300.039" dur="5.481">recession and we see countries like</text>
  <text start="302.289" dur="5.971">Germany UK they&amp;#39;re teetering on a</text>
  <text start="305.52" dur="4.42">recession of course everyone&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="308.26" dur="5.129">convince us that everything is fine but</text>
  <text start="309.94" dur="6.78">we can see the indicators and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="313.389" dur="4.941">showing up and flashing a red signal at</text>
  <text start="316.72" dur="4.169">this time here in the United States</text>
  <text start="318.33" dur="5.11">we&amp;#39;re seeing flashing red signals all</text>
  <text start="320.889" dur="7.71">over the place I mean look at</text>
  <text start="323.44" dur="9.81">caterpillar caterpillar right now has</text>
  <text start="328.599" dur="8.69">reported an unprecedented 28 months of</text>
  <text start="333.25" dur="6.33">declining global retail sales now if</text>
  <text start="337.289" dur="5.41">everything is fine and everyone&amp;#39;s in a</text>
  <text start="339.58" dur="7.649">recovery and everyone is doing well why</text>
  <text start="342.699" dur="8.361">are we seeing this the month of March is</text>
  <text start="347.229" dur="7.891">seeing a sixteen percent year-over-year</text>

  <text start="361.21" dur="7.22">seeing a thirty-four percent plunge and</text>
  <text start="365.82" dur="6.55">basically what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="368.43" dur="6.669">during the recession from 2008 they had</text>
  <text start="372.37" dur="5.4">19 months of consecutive declines you</text>

  <text start="377.77" dur="9.63">28th month of declines much much worse</text>
  <text start="383.099" dur="8.201">than from 2008 to 2010 because what</text>

  <text start="431.98" dur="4.44">online sales and this is a recipe for</text>
  <text start="434.86" dur="5.4">disaster of course everyone things</text>
  <text start="436.42" dur="5.97">online sales is the way everyone the way</text>
  <text start="440.26" dur="4.44">everything is going but I hate to say it</text>
  <text start="442.39" dur="5.01">a lot of people still like going in and</text>
  <text start="444.7" dur="5.07">getting what they want on the same day</text>
  <text start="447.4" dur="6.03">they don&amp;#39;t want to wait 5-6 days they</text>
  <text start="449.77" dur="6.29">don&amp;#39;t want to pay for shipping and right</text>
  <text start="453.43" dur="5.52">now we see a lot of these companies</text>
  <text start="456.06" dur="5.65">they&amp;#39;re closing down and people are</text>
  <text start="458.95" dur="4.77">being laid off and you know once they</text>
  <text start="461.71" dur="3.48">lay off all these employees they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="463.72" dur="5.7">going to hire them back on the online</text>
  <text start="465.19" dur="8.13">sale area now these people will be out</text>
  <text start="469.42" dur="6.24">looking for more work we understand</text>
  <text start="473.32" dur="7.17">those students kind of coming out of</text>
  <text start="475.66" dur="7.5">college they cannot find work they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="480.49" dur="5.79">coming out with a huge amount of debt we</text>
  <text start="483.16" dur="5.25">understand that the delinquencies are</text>
  <text start="486.28" dur="3.6">continually rising and there was an</text>
  <text start="488.41" dur="3.24">initial report that I did that the</text>
  <text start="489.88" dur="4.08">villain currency rate was about eighteen</text>
  <text start="491.65" dur="4.68">percent but when we look at this and we</text>
  <text start="493.96" dur="5.22">see what has been going on here we see</text>
  <text start="496.33" dur="5.94">that the delinquency rate among students</text>
  <text start="499.18" dur="6.21">right now on their student loans is more</text>
  <text start="502.27" dur="6.66">like thirty percent and the st. Louis</text>
  <text start="505.39" dur="6.51">Fed is out there saying that the trend</text>
  <text start="508.93" dur="5.94">of students who are delinquent on their</text>
  <text start="511.9" dur="6.96">loans is increasing and it is getting</text>
  <text start="514.87" dur="6.54">out of hand basically what the Fed is</text>
  <text start="518.86" dur="5.91">saying is delinquency rates are on the</text>
  <text start="521.41" dur="4.98">rise and the percentage of delinquent</text>
  <text start="524.77" dur="5.9">borrowers who have simply stopped making</text>
  <text start="526.39" dur="7.62">payments late or not is rising every</text>
  <text start="530.67" dur="3.77">single day and it&amp;#39;s getting worse and</text>
  <text start="534.01" dur="3.18">this is</text>
  <text start="534.44" dur="5.31">why the White House wants to basically</text>
  <text start="537.19" dur="4.42">write off this debt they want they want</text>
  <text start="539.75" dur="4.08">to make it possible where these people</text>
  <text start="541.61" dur="4.44">can go bankrupt so the American people</text>
  <text start="543.83" dur="4.08">can bail out the entire system you have</text>
  <text start="546.05" dur="6.03">to remember Moody&amp;#39;s is about to</text>
  <text start="547.91" dur="5.79">downgrade the student loan debt just</text>
  <text start="552.08" dur="3.72">like they did with the subprime</text>
  <text start="553.7" dur="3.57">securities they were at triple-a and</text>
  <text start="555.8" dur="3.15">then all of a sudden they started</text>
  <text start="557.27" dur="4.68">lowering them people started to bail</text>
  <text start="558.95" dur="5.61">we&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing occur once</text>
  <text start="561.95" dur="4.02">again now all over the corporate media</text>
  <text start="564.56" dur="4.56">today they&amp;#39;re telling everyone how great</text>
  <text start="565.97" dur="5.22">home sales are everything is bouncing up</text>
  <text start="569.12" dur="5.01">this is the best in 18 months it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="571.19" dur="7.25">incredible March existing home sales</text>
  <text start="574.13" dur="8.31">surged 6.1 percent the highest since</text>
  <text start="578.44" dur="6.27">2013 but when we look around and we look</text>
  <text start="582.44" dur="5.01">at lumber sales we look at mortgage</text>
  <text start="584.71" dur="5.35">applications basically bottom-feeding</text>
  <text start="587.45" dur="5.04">bouncing up and down and when we</text>
  <text start="590.06" dur="4.73">actually look at the graphs and we</text>
  <text start="592.49" dur="5.82">actually look at where we are today</text>
  <text start="594.79" dur="6.52">we&amp;#39;re not seeing an improvement existing</text>
  <text start="598.31" dur="6.12">home sales right now is basically in a</text>
  <text start="601.31" dur="7.95">dead cow a dead cat bounce we are at</text>
  <text start="604.43" dur="12.78">nineteen ninety eight levels if we look</text>
  <text start="609.26" dur="11.49">at new home sales we are at 19 Wow</text>
  <text start="617.21" dur="7.44">nineteen sixty eight levels at this</text>
  <text start="620.75" dur="6.75">point and if you look I put the graph on</text>
  <text start="624.65" dur="7.35">the YouTube video and on the expo 2x22</text>
  <text start="627.5" dur="8.55">report com site you can see each time we</text>
  <text start="632" dur="6.81">had this we are in a recession if we are</text>
  <text start="636.05" dur="7.14">this low in sales with new homes and</text>
  <text start="638.81" dur="7.86">existing homes we are right now in a</text>
  <text start="643.19" dur="7.35">recession but of course the corporate</text>
  <text start="646.67" dur="5.27">media the government the central bankers</text>
  <text start="650.54" dur="3.48">are trying to convince us that</text>
  <text start="651.94" dur="4.36">everything is fine in the real estate</text>
  <text start="654.02" dur="6.69">market and it isn&amp;#39;t and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="656.3" dur="6.33">seeing is still cash sales cash sales</text>
  <text start="660.71" dur="5.19">are making up around twenty three</text>

  <text start="668.089" dur="4.86">and first-time buyers is around thirty</text>
  <text start="671.18" dur="4.019">percent and then of course we have other</text>
  <text start="672.949" dur="4.95">cells going down the line and what this</text>
  <text start="675.199" dur="5.94">tells us and we have to remember Freddie</text>
  <text start="677.899" dur="7.38">and Fannie implemented a new program</text>
  <text start="681.139" dur="7.14">three percent down they will give loans</text>

  <text start="692.839" dur="6.901">pay for the closing costs and you can be</text>
  <text start="695.569" dur="8.401">a sub prime bar we saw this occur back</text>
  <text start="699.74" dur="7.139">in 2006-2007 moving into 2008 and guess</text>
  <text start="703.97" dur="5.159">what happened all of those people left</text>
  <text start="706.879" dur="6.12">their homes and they were foreclosed</text>
  <text start="709.129" dur="6.481">upon we are going to see the same exact</text>
  <text start="712.999" dur="4.171">thing because they want everybody in to</text>

  <text start="1117.43" dur="4.56">and many other nations are doing the</text>
  <text start="1119.53" dur="5.13">same because they realize once this war</text>
  <text start="1121.99" dur="5.61">starts this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1124.66" dur="6.51">going to need to do now we understand</text>
  <text start="1127.6" dur="7.77">that china is continually purchasing</text>
  <text start="1131.17" dur="7.8">gold but what&amp;#39;s happening is nobody</text>
  <text start="1135.37" dur="8.01">really knows how much gold they have I</text>
  <text start="1138.97" dur="6.83">mean back in April of 2009 they said</text>
  <text start="1143.38" dur="5.94">that their gold holdings were around</text>
  <text start="1145.8" dur="6.52">1054 metric tons and we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="1149.32" dur="6.21">Bloomberg intelligence right now is</text>
  <text start="1152.32" dur="5.79">saying since that period their gold</text>
  <text start="1155.53" dur="6.99">holdings might be three times as much</text>
  <text start="1158.11" dur="6.75">right now about 3,500 metric tons and if</text>
  <text start="1162.52" dur="5.28">that is the case China would therefore</text>
  <text start="1164.86" dur="5.31">have the third largest gold reserve in</text>
  <text start="1167.8" dur="6.15">the world second only to the US and</text>
  <text start="1170.17" dur="6.93">Germany but with the u.s. we have to</text>
  <text start="1173.95" dur="6.26">remember we really don&amp;#39;t know how much</text>
  <text start="1177.1" dur="7.08">the u.s. actually has in gold deposits</text>
  <text start="1180.21" dur="7.69">because the Fed refuses to have it</text>
  <text start="1184.18" dur="6.5">audited and we have to understand that</text>
  <text start="1187.9" dur="6.12">Germany is having difficulty</text>
  <text start="1190.68" dur="6.7">repatriating much of its gold stored at</text>
  <text start="1194.02" dur="6.36">the Federal Reserve so this tells us</text>
  <text start="1197.38" dur="5.25">that the u.s. might not even have as</text>
  <text start="1200.38" dur="6.05">much gold as everyone thinks that</text>
  <text start="1202.63" dur="8.45">actually China might be the leader in</text>
  <text start="1206.43" dur="9.67">gold and we can see at this point</text>
  <text start="1211.08" dur="6.37">without a proper audit of the Fed we</text>
  <text start="1216.1" dur="2.55">really don&amp;#39;t know how much gold there</text>
  <text start="1217.45" dur="3.48">really is there&amp;#39;s a lot of people out</text>
  <text start="1218.65" dur="5.97">there saying all the gold is completely</text>
  <text start="1220.93" dur="5.55">gone and the Fed if you really think</text>
  <text start="1224.62" dur="6.5">about it what would be the reasons for</text>
  <text start="1226.48" dur="6.65">them in stopping an audit of the gold</text>
  <text start="1231.12" dur="4.78">basically I can only think of one</text>
  <text start="1233.13" dur="4.69">actually maybe two which almost that</text>
  <text start="1235.9" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re almost the same the gold is</text>
  <text start="1237.82" dur="5.37">completely gone or they might have half</text>
  <text start="1240.01" dur="5.37">or a quarter of it and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1243.19" dur="5.67">to shock the system because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1245.38" dur="5.04">exactly what will happen and probably</text>
  <text start="1248.86" dur="3.3">that gold that they might that they</text>
  <text start="1250.42" dur="3.96">still have left which is probably a very</text>
  <text start="1252.16" dur="7.38">small portion of it is probably leased</text>
  <text start="1254.38" dur="6.9">out many many many times now John Kerry</text>
  <text start="1259.54" dur="5.82">was out there and he was giving a speech</text>
  <text start="1261.28" dur="6.06">and he&amp;#39;s saying that countries are far</text>

  <text start="2427.19" dur="7.82">doing and of course this will set off</text>

  <text start="2443.6" dur="5.37">citizens you&amp;#39;re on your own so Russia</text>
  <text start="2445.79" dur="6.62">came in and evacuated US citizens with</text>
  <text start="2448.97" dur="6.21">other nationals from different countries</text>
  <text start="2452.41" dur="4.33">it&amp;#39;s amazing how the US doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="2455.18" dur="3.66">care about their people you know what</text>
  <text start="2456.74" dur="7.34">they&amp;#39;re worried about restoring the</text>
  <text start="2458.84" dur="8.73">puppet government in Yemen we understand</text>
  <text start="2464.08" dur="5.59">the United States has warships and of</text>
  <text start="2467.57" dur="6.72">course yesterday we talked about them</text>
  <text start="2469.67" dur="6.24">coming and stopping the arms from being</text>
  <text start="2474.29" dur="3.75">delivered to the hoodies so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2475.91" dur="5.82">going to stop the Iranian ships and we</text>
  <text start="2478.04" dur="9.42">know for a fact Iran is not going to</text>
  <text start="2481.73" dur="8.4">bring arms on their warships into Yemen</text>
  <text start="2487.46" dur="5.31">with the u.s. right there it makes no</text>
  <text start="2490.13" dur="5.04">sense this is made up propaganda to</text>
  <text start="2492.77" dur="6.06">convince everyone that Iran is part of</text>
  <text start="2495.17" dur="7.01">what is going on here I mean the US was</text>
  <text start="2498.83" dur="5.73">completely embarrassed last week after</text>
  <text start="2502.18" dur="5.2">one of its ships taking part in the</text>
  <text start="2504.56" dur="4.11">blockade boarded a Panamanian cargo ship</text>
  <text start="2507.38" dur="3.15">because they said there is weapons in</text>
  <text start="2508.67" dur="5.34">there for the Hootie&amp;#39;s guess what they</text>
  <text start="2510.53" dur="5.67">found absolutely nothing they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="2514.01" dur="4.56">going ahead and boarding these different</text>
  <text start="2516.2" dur="6.93">ships trying to find these weapons</text>
  <text start="2518.57" dur="7.35">someplace the Saudi prince tweeted the</text>
  <text start="2523.13" dur="5">following any fighter pilot who took</text>
  <text start="2525.92" dur="6.27">part in the Yemen bombing campaign and</text>
  <text start="2528.13" dur="7.39">hits civilians will get a Bentley and</text>
  <text start="2532.19" dur="6.72">then he quickly deleted it</text>
  <text start="2535.52" dur="6.36">so basically you can see their objective</text>
  <text start="2538.91" dur="4.77">is to punish the people in Yemen for</text>
  <text start="2541.88" dur="8.52">kicking out the puppet government that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2543.68" dur="10.11">it right now I ran the Yemeni people the</text>
  <text start="2550.4" dur="7.55">UN they&amp;#39;re all calling for peace a</text>
  <text start="2553.79" dur="8.34">ceasefire we see the hoodies right now</text>
  <text start="2557.95" dur="5.89">are still being bombarded by airstrikes</text>
  <text start="2562.13" dur="4.95">even though they told this decisive</text>
  <text start="2563.84" dur="6.15">storm has stopped they&amp;#39;re still bombing</text>
  <text start="2567.08" dur="4.86">and basically what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="2569.99" dur="3.57">the Hootie&amp;#39;s are saying listen if you</text>
  <text start="2571.94" dur="4.47">want to talk and you want to talk peace</text>
  <text start="2573.56" dur="5.73">you need to stop the bombing in this</text>
  <text start="2576.41" dur="6.18">country and then we can resume our talks</text>
  <text start="2579.29" dur="4.14">of peace and the Hootie&amp;#39;s know basically</text>
  <text start="2582.59" dur="3.27">what the united states government</text>
  <text start="2583.43" dur="5.58">central bankers want they want the</text>
  <text start="2585.86" dur="6.69">government restored to the puppet</text>

  <text start="2592.55" dur="2.91">course they&amp;#39;re going to use double talk</text>
  <text start="2593.99" dur="3.24">of course they&amp;#39;re going to contrive</text>
  <text start="2595.46" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re going to try to convince them</text>
  <text start="2597.23" dur="4.98">that things are different this time it</text>
  <text start="2599.63" dur="4.59">will be better you can work together as</text>
  <text start="2602.21" dur="4.59">a dual government but you know this is</text>
  <text start="2604.22" dur="5.4">not going to work out the Hootie&amp;#39;s know</text>
  <text start="2606.8" dur="4.59">how the Americans work how well I</text>
  <text start="2609.62" dur="4.11">shouldn&amp;#39;t say the Americans the US</text>
  <text start="2611.39" dur="4.14">government works the central bankers</text>
  <text start="2613.73" dur="4.29">work they tell them whatever they want</text>
  <text start="2615.53" dur="5.19">to hear and then all of a sudden we have</text>
  <text start="2618.02" dur="6.45">the same problem over and over and over</text>
  <text start="2620.72" dur="7.77">again and of course we can see right now</text>
  <text start="2624.47" dur="6.99">the US has deployed 12 warships to the</text>
  <text start="2628.49" dur="6.54">Gulf of Aden they&amp;#39;re bringing in more</text>
  <text start="2631.46" dur="8.72">and more warships to this area and of</text>
  <text start="2635.03" dur="8.19">course as we know the Saudi government</text>
  <text start="2640.18" dur="5.59">the u.s. they&amp;#39;re saying uh it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2643.22" dur="5.07">victory we set out to what we needed to</text>
  <text start="2645.77" dur="4.8">do in Yemen we bomb the people we bomb</text>
  <text start="2648.29" dur="3.93">their infrastructure and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2650.57" dur="4.71">going to give up and now we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="2652.22" dur="5.52">start operational operation renewal of</text>
  <text start="2655.28" dur="4.41">Hope which is really operation restore</text>
  <text start="2657.74" dur="4.02">the puppet government that&amp;#39;s really what</text>
  <text start="2659.69" dur="4.56">it is and it means that they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="2661.76" dur="4.26">ready to go in with some type of land</text>
  <text start="2664.25" dur="3.69">invasion basically they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="2666.02" dur="3.09">rebranding it right now because the</text>
  <text start="2667.94" dur="3.96">Saudis wouldn&amp;#39;t allow</text>
  <text start="2669.11" dur="4.83">humanitarian aid in or they let it</text>
  <text start="2671.9" dur="5.67">trickle in a little bit the people are</text>
  <text start="2673.94" dur="5.94">suffering they have a naval blockade so</text>
  <text start="2677.57" dur="5.73">supplies cannot come in to the ports of</text>
  <text start="2679.88" dur="5.07">Yemen and right now the world is looking</text>
  <text start="2683.3" dur="5.43">at this and all they&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="2684.95" dur="7.29">bombing of the people of Yemen and Yemen</text>
  <text start="2688.73" dur="5.64">didn&amp;#39;t attack anyone Saudi Arabia is the</text>
  <text start="2692.24" dur="4.13">aggressor and if we really think about</text>
  <text start="2694.37" dur="4.47">this and we turn the situation around</text>
  <text start="2696.37" dur="6.07">think about this for a second the way it</text>
  <text start="2698.84" dur="7.02">would look if we changed the news</text>
  <text start="2702.44" dur="5.67">stories and what you think the US</text>
  <text start="2705.86" dur="5.91">government and the rest of the world</text>
  <text start="2708.11" dur="7.55">would think if we changed it to this the</text>
  <text start="2711.77" dur="7.53">Russian government started bombing Yemen</text>
  <text start="2715.66" dur="7.87">the Russian government decided to fly</text>
