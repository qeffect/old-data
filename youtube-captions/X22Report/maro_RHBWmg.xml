  <text start="105.46" dur="5.34">indicators showing us that the economy</text>
  <text start="107.65" dur="5.07">well it&amp;#39;s not doing as well as the</text>
  <text start="110.8" dur="4.38">corporate media wants us to believe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="112.72" dur="4.44">not doing as well as the government</text>
  <text start="115.18" dur="4.02">officials want us to believe it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="117.16" dur="4.02">doing as well as the Fed wants us to</text>
  <text start="119.2" dur="5.01">believe and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="121.18" dur="6.99">is that the auto boom well it&amp;#39;s over</text>
  <text start="124.21" dur="7.7">right now dealers are widely overweight</text>
  <text start="128.17" dur="6.24">in SUV&amp;#39;s and the market is turning and</text>
  <text start="131.91" dur="5.14">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="134.41" dur="4.62">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people out there who</text>
  <text start="137.05" dur="3.96">just cannot buy an automobile and</text>
  <text start="139.03" dur="3.9">remember how they got people into the</text>
  <text start="141.01" dur="4.17">automobile market they went down the</text>
  <text start="142.93" dur="4.559">soprano subprime to sub subprime and</text>
  <text start="145.18" dur="4.47">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that we&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="147.489" dur="3.03">major problem now now remember a</text>
  <text start="149.65" dur="5.73">vehicles</text>
  <text start="150.519" dur="8.851">account for 20% of retail spending and a</text>
  <text start="155.38" dur="8.88">crash in the auto sector will impact</text>
  <text start="159.37" dur="7.17">retail it will impact GDP and everything</text>
  <text start="164.26" dur="5.12">is going to start to crash and this is</text>
  <text start="166.54" dur="6.69">exactly what is going to happen remember</text>
  <text start="169.38" dur="6.97">70% of GDP is made up of retail now we</text>
  <text start="173.23" dur="3.93">know that brick-and-mortar stores the</text>
  <text start="176.35" dur="2.699">retail sales</text>
  <text start="177.16" dur="3.84">they are absolutely awful their stores</text>
  <text start="179.049" dur="4.801">closing left and right people being laid</text>
  <text start="181" dur="4.98">off and it doesn&amp;#39;t look good at all when</text>
  <text start="183.85" dur="2.38">we look at the Census Department they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="185.98" dur="2.86">at</text>
  <text start="186.23" dur="4.589">retail sales report we can see where</text>
  <text start="188.84" dur="4.709">people spend most where they spend most</text>
  <text start="190.819" dur="6.541">of their money it&amp;#39;s not in electronics</text>
  <text start="193.549" dur="6.451">it&amp;#39;s not in furniture one it&amp;#39;s in food</text>
  <text start="197.36" dur="6.18">and beverage stores food service and</text>
  <text start="200" dur="8.78">drinking places and the top one is motor</text>
  <text start="203.54" dur="9.33">vehicle and parts now once again if</text>
  <text start="208.78" dur="7.12">motor vehicles if they cannot sell the</text>
  <text start="212.87" dur="5.94">automobiles there is going to be a major</text>
  <text start="215.9" dur="6.03">problem because this is going to affect</text>
  <text start="218.81" dur="5.63">retail sales and you can see right now</text>
  <text start="221.93" dur="5.52">that if this does happen</text>
  <text start="224.44" dur="4.23">well retail sales is going to be a</text>
  <text start="227.45" dur="4.17">complete disaster</text>
  <text start="228.67" dur="5.649">now Motor Vehicles and parts like I said</text>
  <text start="231.62" dur="4.89">they count for 21 percent of retail</text>
  <text start="234.319" dur="4.371">sales gasoline stations account for</text>
  <text start="236.51" dur="4.83">seven seven point nine four percent and</text>
  <text start="238.69" dur="5.439">together they account for twenty nine</text>
  <text start="241.34" dur="4.14">percent of retail sales and again we</text>
  <text start="244.129" dur="3.571">have the food and beverage and the food</text>
  <text start="245.48" dur="4.619">service and then we have the rest of</text>
  <text start="247.7" dur="3.93">retail so you can see right now the</text>
  <text start="250.099" dur="3.811">reason why they&amp;#39;ve been keeping the</text>
  <text start="251.63" dur="5.729">automobile industry propped up like this</text>
  <text start="253.91" dur="6.96">because that is a huge chunk of retail</text>
  <text start="257.359" dur="5.761">and they realize that retail on its own</text>
  <text start="260.87" dur="3.87">people are not spending money they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="263.12" dur="3.63">not going to online everyone&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="264.74" dur="3.84">switching and we have the same number of</text>
  <text start="266.75" dur="3.99">people shopping online as they were with</text>
  <text start="268.58" dur="5.22">brick-and-mortar they needed to keep</text>
  <text start="270.74" dur="3.48">retail sales propped up how do you do</text>
  <text start="273.8" dur="3.299">that</text>
  <text start="274.22" dur="4.14">well you can do it by giving people</text>
  <text start="277.099" dur="3.151">loans where they don&amp;#39;t have to take</text>
  <text start="278.36" dur="4.41">money out of their pocket you go into a</text>
  <text start="280.25" dur="4.26">dealership you get a lease 0% down you</text>
  <text start="282.77" dur="4.32">walk out with a car boom</text>
  <text start="284.51" dur="5.629">retail sales are up this is what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="287.09" dur="5.61">been seeing now remember the dealership</text>
  <text start="290.139" dur="4">they receive the automobiles from the</text>
  <text start="292.7" dur="3.99">automobile manufacturers when they</text>
  <text start="294.139" dur="5.101">receive the automobiles which is channel</text>
  <text start="296.69" dur="4.53">stuffing their Lots that is counted as</text>
  <text start="299.24" dur="4.62">sales now if they can&amp;#39;t move the</text>
  <text start="301.22" dur="5.129">vehicles at this point there&amp;#39;s no room</text>
  <text start="303.86" dur="5.58">for more vehicles to come in and this is</text>
  <text start="306.349" dur="5.431">where the problem is and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="309.44" dur="4.56">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="311.78" dur="5.52">most likely going to see retail sales</text>
  <text start="314" dur="5.52">take a huge hit and this is going to</text>
  <text start="317.3" dur="4.14">then here GDP</text>
  <text start="319.52" dur="4.59">and you&amp;#39;re gonna see the economy start</text>
  <text start="321.44" dur="4.05">to really disintegrate now very</text>
  <text start="324.11" dur="5.369">interestingly we know the central</text>
  <text start="325.49" dur="6.299">bankers they&amp;#39;ve been controlling many</text>
  <text start="329.479" dur="5.611">many different countries and last year</text>
  <text start="331.789" dur="7.19">Putin was out there and he banned the</text>
  <text start="335.09" dur="6.329">Rothschild banking system in Russia and</text>
  <text start="338.979" dur="7.271">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is just one year later</text>
  <text start="341.419" dur="8.641">he is declared that Russia is totally</text>
  <text start="346.25" dur="6.24">independent of the global banking cartel</text>
  <text start="350.06" dur="5.07">and the Rothschilds International money</text>
  <text start="352.49" dur="5.489">lending organizations he&amp;#39;s declaring</text>
  <text start="355.13" dur="4.5">that this achievement is the greatest</text>
  <text start="357.979" dur="4.861">gift that can be given to future</text>
  <text start="359.63" dur="5.34">generations he understands by having a</text>
  <text start="362.84" dur="5.669">central bank a private western central</text>
  <text start="364.97" dur="6.479">bank in his country or any country it</text>
  <text start="368.509" dur="4.171">destroys the country and I think a lot</text>
  <text start="371.449" dur="2.28">of countries are starting to wake up to</text>
  <text start="372.68" dur="4.979">this and they&amp;#39;re starting to realize</text>
  <text start="373.729" dur="5.851">that we cannot have a central a private</text>
  <text start="377.659" dur="4.651">western central banking system in the</text>
  <text start="379.58" dur="5.19">country that basically creates currency</text>
  <text start="382.31" dur="5.97">loans it to the government with interest</text>
  <text start="384.77" dur="6.03">attached it just doesn&amp;#39;t work now Putin</text>
  <text start="388.28" dur="3.93">went on to say that you know they said</text>
  <text start="390.8" dur="5.28">we couldn&amp;#39;t do it they said it would be</text>
  <text start="392.21" dur="6.78">it would destroy Russia he said but we</text>
  <text start="396.08" dur="6.089">were able to do it we&amp;#39;re able to remove</text>
  <text start="398.99" dur="5.13">the Rothschild banking system and all</text>
  <text start="402.169" dur="3.421">those people who said that you know the</text>
  <text start="404.12" dur="3.06">Rothschilds in the central banking</text>
  <text start="405.59" dur="5.1">system it was going to destroy the</text>
  <text start="407.18" dur="7.349">country it didn&amp;#39;t happen now the central</text>
  <text start="410.69" dur="5.64">bankers normally push the idea that if</text>
  <text start="414.529" dur="3.781">you remove the central banking system</text>
  <text start="416.33" dur="4.29">the country will not be able to operate</text>
  <text start="418.31" dur="3.78">look what happened in the UK when they</text>
  <text start="420.62" dur="5.01">were trying when they were going through</text>
  <text start="422.09" dur="6.509">the referendum to detach themselves from</text>
  <text start="425.63" dur="4.89">the EU which was the brexit they came up</text>
  <text start="428.599" dur="3.271">with all these things well the UK is</text>
  <text start="430.52" dur="2.97">going to be destroyed they&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="431.87" dur="3.75">be able to function and they came up</text>
  <text start="433.49" dur="4.89">with so many different things that they</text>
  <text start="435.62" dur="4.949">all didn&amp;#39;t come true actually once the</text>
  <text start="438.38" dur="6.509">central banking system is removed and</text>
  <text start="440.569" dur="7.65">the people take back the entire system</text>
  <text start="444.889" dur="5.58">the country does very very well look at</text>
  <text start="448.219" dur="4.23">Iceland they took bankers and they threw</text>
  <text start="450.469" dur="2.991">him into prison they took control of the</text>
  <text start="452.449" dur="3.461">central bank</text>
  <text start="453.46" dur="4.98">and their economy is doing very well and</text>
  <text start="455.91" dur="4.42">if you look at the countries that still</text>
  <text start="458.44" dur="5.099">have the central banking system like</text>
  <text start="460.33" dur="6.269">Greece like Spain like Italy the United</text>
  <text start="463.539" dur="4.861">States Canada and the rest you can see</text>
  <text start="466.599" dur="4.051">that these countries they&amp;#39;re in a huge</text>
  <text start="468.4" dur="4.47">amount of debt their economies are not</text>
  <text start="470.65" dur="4.59">doing that great unemployment is off the</text>
  <text start="472.87" dur="6.81">charts and it is getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="475.24" dur="7.429">as time goes on so basically what has to</text>
  <text start="479.68" dur="8.31">be done now is with every single country</text>
  <text start="482.669" dur="7.661">the people need to protest they need to</text>
  <text start="487.99" dur="5.31">say listen to the government officials</text>
  <text start="490.33" dur="5.459">we don&amp;#39;t want the private western</text>
  <text start="493.3" dur="4.32">central banks anymore there is no need</text>
  <text start="495.789" dur="3.451">for them there is no purpose for them</text>
  <text start="497.62" dur="3.24">and I know a lot of people make the case</text>
  <text start="499.24" dur="3.72">well they handle the monetary system</text>
  <text start="500.86" dur="3.6">they make sure that everything no that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="502.96" dur="3.75">not what they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re not part</text>
  <text start="504.46" dur="5.04">of the people system they were private</text>
  <text start="506.71" dur="4.98">separate corporation their interest is</text>
  <text start="509.5" dur="4.289">their own yes they might have a couple</text>
  <text start="511.69" dur="3.93">of mandates that they put in when they</text>
  <text start="513.789" dur="3.781">created the system this is the what this</text>
  <text start="515.62" dur="6">is the way they were able to to function</text>
  <text start="517.57" dur="5.07">all this time but in reality we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="521.62" dur="3.42">know what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="522.64" dur="5.09">there&amp;#39;s no audit there&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="525.04" dur="5.34">nothing we really don&amp;#39;t know how much</text>
  <text start="527.73" dur="4.66">money they created we really don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="530.38" dur="3.81">where they&amp;#39;ve been shipping it off to</text>
  <text start="532.39" dur="3.66">yes we have some idea we&amp;#39;ve done a</text>
  <text start="534.19" dur="4.2">little investigative reporting and we</text>
  <text start="536.05" dur="4.38">can find out some information but we</text>
  <text start="538.39" dur="6.03">don&amp;#39;t know everything because they keep</text>
  <text start="540.43" dur="6.84">everything a secret and this is a huge</text>
  <text start="544.42" dur="6.03">problem and what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="547.27" dur="6.66">is their entire system it is</text>
  <text start="550.45" dur="6.27">deteriorating very very quickly and what</text>
  <text start="553.93" dur="7.11">we&amp;#39;re seeing is each part of the economy</text>
  <text start="556.72" dur="6.63">completely break apart and falter that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="561.04" dur="4.53">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="563.35" dur="4.08">a good sign because we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="565.57" dur="3.81">this for quite a while and as we</text>
  <text start="567.43" dur="5.279">continually report we can see that each</text>
  <text start="569.38" dur="4.649">sector breaks down and it gets worse and</text>
  <text start="572.709" dur="4.051">worse it doesn&amp;#39;t get better</text>
  <text start="574.029" dur="6.111">remember the retail industry was propped</text>
  <text start="576.76" dur="6.269">up by these cheap loans no money down no</text>
  <text start="580.14" dur="5.38">interest to keep retail propped up</text>
  <text start="583.029" dur="4.261">because the real retail market it was</text>
  <text start="585.52" dur="3.78">collapsing and there was nothing</text>
  <text start="587.29" dur="3.27">they can do to stop it they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="589.3" dur="3.599">make people go out and spend money</text>
  <text start="590.56" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s completely impossible that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="592.899" dur="2.761">they were talking about helicopter money</text>
  <text start="594.31" dur="3.089">that&amp;#39;s why they were talking about hey</text>
  <text start="595.66" dur="4.229">if we just give the people money this</text>
  <text start="597.399" dur="4.711">economy will continue to move forward</text>
  <text start="599.889" dur="3.031">but it&amp;#39;s not going to work because most</text>
  <text start="602.11" dur="2.25">of the people saying you know what I</text>
  <text start="602.92" dur="2.909">need this money to pay my electric bill</text>
  <text start="604.36" dur="3.27">I didn&amp;#39;t this money to pay for my gas</text>
  <text start="605.829" dur="3.75">bill I need it for my rent or my</text>
  <text start="607.63" dur="3.93">mortgage and they weren&amp;#39;t gonna go out</text>
  <text start="609.579" dur="4.281">and spend it on retail now people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="611.56" dur="5.79">spending on a retail guess what</text>
  <text start="613.86" dur="7.899">manufacturing doesn&amp;#39;t do well we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="617.35" dur="7.919">import as much we don&amp;#39;t export as much</text>
  <text start="621.759" dur="5.911">and the whole thing starts to break down</text>
  <text start="625.269" dur="4.951">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now now</text>
  <text start="627.67" dur="4.32">once the retail market starts to go it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="630.22" dur="3.739">going to cascade the housing markets</text>
  <text start="631.99" dur="5.01">going to start to go because remember if</text>
  <text start="633.959" dur="5.081">retail is not doing well and automobile</text>
  <text start="637" dur="4.38">dealerships start to close because sales</text>
  <text start="639.04" dur="5.159">aren&amp;#39;t that great we saw it back in 2008</text>
  <text start="641.38" dur="4.519">when Pontiac they decided to close that</text>
  <text start="644.199" dur="5.13">think of how many dealerships there were</text>
  <text start="645.899" dur="4.901">when other things started to go out of</text>
  <text start="649.329" dur="3.801">business they had to lay off these</text>
  <text start="650.8" dur="5.31">people manufacturers like Saturn also</text>
  <text start="653.13" dur="5.62">this is going to be devastating to the</text>
  <text start="656.11" dur="5.4">economy and this is where we&amp;#39;re headed</text>
  <text start="658.75" dur="4.86">right now and you can see as we look at</text>
  <text start="661.51" dur="4.199">all of this and we follow it and we map</text>
  <text start="663.61" dur="5.57">it out we can see that it&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="665.709" dur="6.541">breaking down and as we move into this</text>
  <text start="669.18" dur="4.659">latter part of the year it&amp;#39;s just going</text>
  <text start="672.25" dur="3.959">to get worse this holiday season right</text>
  <text start="673.839" dur="4.831">now is going to be most likely the worst</text>
  <text start="676.209" dur="4.171">season that we&amp;#39;ve ever seen because</text>
  <text start="678.67" dur="3.57">think about how many stores have closed</text>
  <text start="680.38" dur="4.68">thinking about how many people lost</text>
  <text start="682.24" dur="5.25">their jobs think about all these people</text>
  <text start="685.06" dur="5.1">who are now delinquent on a lot of their</text>
  <text start="687.49" dur="4.5">automobile loans how many people are</text>
  <text start="690.16" dur="3.21">becoming delinquent on their mortgages</text>
  <text start="691.99" dur="4.56">because they really can&amp;#39;t pay for them</text>
  <text start="693.37" dur="5.519">it&amp;#39;s going to be a complete disaster and</text>
  <text start="696.55" dur="4.56">you&amp;#39;re gonna see as we approach the</text>
  <text start="698.889" dur="4.021">latter part of this year it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="701.11" dur="4.11">get worse and worse and worse and as we</text>
  <text start="702.91" dur="4.32">move into 2018 we&amp;#39;re gonna see no</text>
  <text start="705.22" dur="4.02">improvement whatsoever this is why you</text>
  <text start="707.23" dur="4.409">need to be prepared this is why you need</text>
  <text start="709.24" dur="4.14">to ready to be ready this is why Russia</text>
  <text start="711.639" dur="3.781">decided to detach themselves from the</text>
  <text start="713.38" dur="4.559">Rothschild banking system this is why</text>
  <text start="715.42" dur="4.89">countries are dealing outside that a dot</text>
  <text start="717.939" dur="3.15">of the dollar yes they use dollars in</text>
  <text start="720.31" dur="3.059">certain instance</text>
  <text start="721.089" dur="4.8">but for the most part they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="723.369" dur="4.23">create systems which are completely</text>
  <text start="725.889" dur="3.99">separate and apart from the West system</text>
  <text start="727.599" dur="4.17">because they understand that when this</text>
  <text start="729.879" dur="4.29">whole thing falls apart they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="731.769" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re gonna need to be able to keep</text>
  <text start="734.169" dur="5.25">their entire country the entire system</text>
  <text start="736.839" dur="4.77">up and running and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="739.419" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;ve been preparing for and if</text>
  <text start="741.609" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re purport preparing for it if</text>
  <text start="743.559" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re purchasing gold if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="745.359" dur="4.08">moving away from the private western</text>
  <text start="747.189" dur="3.81">central banking system you need to do</text>
  <text start="749.439" dur="3.12">the same thing well how do you move away</text>
  <text start="750.999" dur="4.95">from the private western central banking</text>
  <text start="752.559" dur="7.38">system very easily instead of using the</text>
  <text start="755.949" dur="7.74">dollar which is a federal debt note get</text>
  <text start="759.939" dur="8.28">some silver get some gold and keep it as</text>
  <text start="763.689" dur="6.57">an insurance policy even take some of</text>
  <text start="768.219" dur="3.06">your currency and buy some</text>
  <text start="770.259" dur="2.16">cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="771.279" dur="2.28">I&amp;#39;m not saying put everything into</text>
  <text start="772.419" dur="3.03">cryptocurrency I&amp;#39;m not saying put</text>
  <text start="773.559" dur="5.97">everything to silver but these things</text>
  <text start="775.449" dur="7.98">will ensure your wealth whatever you</text>
  <text start="779.529" dur="5.76">have because this is how you separate</text>
  <text start="783.429" dur="4.08">yourself from the central banking system</text>
  <text start="785.289" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s not a complete separation because</text>
  <text start="787.509" dur="4.14">you still need to use dollars to</text>
  <text start="789.159" dur="4.02">function in today&amp;#39;s world but we can see</text>
  <text start="791.649" dur="3.54">that more and more countries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="793.179" dur="3.72">moving down this path this is one way</text>
  <text start="795.189" dur="3.75">that you can do it you can also prepare</text>
  <text start="796.899" dur="3.54">by getting food to make sure that when</text>
  <text start="798.939" dur="4.68">the system comes down you&amp;#39;re prepared</text>
  <text start="800.439" dur="4.97">and ready for whatever happens maybe</text>
  <text start="803.619" dur="5.34">you&amp;#39;ll be just high inflation and</text>
  <text start="805.409" dur="7.84">instead of paying you know $8 $9 $10 for</text>
  <text start="808.959" dur="6.36">a loaf of bread you have bread or some</text>
  <text start="813.249" dur="4.5">other type of food that you can</text>
  <text start="815.319" dur="3.9">substitute for that maybe you froze it</text>
  <text start="817.749" dur="4.2">maybe something else but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="819.219" dur="4.77">something else that you&amp;#39;ve done to to</text>
  <text start="821.949" dur="5.16">make sure that you&amp;#39;re prepared for this</text>
  <text start="823.989" dur="6.3">hyperinflation so whatever you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
