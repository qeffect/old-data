  <text start="77.21" dur="4.14">and geopolitical news now yesterday we</text>
  <text start="79.61" dur="4.74">talked about the Panama papers leak and</text>
  <text start="81.35" dur="5.939">we can see that the leak was given to</text>
  <text start="84.35" dur="5.25">the Western corporate media which as we</text>
  <text start="87.289" dur="4.86">all know they are the gatekeepers to</text>
  <text start="89.6" dur="4.53">information they will give information</text>
  <text start="92.149" dur="4.441">they will hold back information they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="94.13" dur="4.47">lie about information and we can see</text>
  <text start="96.59" dur="5.67">when we look at the Western corporate</text>
  <text start="98.6" dur="6.629">media that the top story on there is</text>
  <text start="102.26" dur="5.31">about Putin it&amp;#39;s about China and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="105.229" dur="6.111">putting all of those leaders on the</text>
  <text start="107.57" dur="6.6">front and what&amp;#39;s missing is the</text>
  <text start="111.34" dur="4.419">Americans now they threw in a couple of</text>
  <text start="114.17" dur="4.17">them sprinkle them around a little bit</text>
  <text start="115.759" dur="5.311">and we can see at this point that the</text>
  <text start="118.34" dur="5.099">Western corporate media they&amp;#39;re keeping</text>
  <text start="121.07" dur="4.74">certain information back most likely</text>
  <text start="123.439" dur="7.041">will never see certain information but</text>
  <text start="125.81" dur="6.269">the leak is being managed by the</text>
  <text start="130.48" dur="4.24">international consortium of</text>
  <text start="132.079" dur="6.871">investigative journalists which is</text>
  <text start="134.72" dur="7.53">funded and organized entirely by the USA</text>
  <text start="138.95" dur="6.06">center for public integrity and their</text>
  <text start="142.25" dur="5.519">funders include the Ford Foundation the</text>
  <text start="145.01" dur="6.569">Carnegie Endowment rock a family family</text>
  <text start="147.769" dur="5.791">fund the WK Kellogg Foundation the open</text>
  <text start="151.579" dur="5.581">society foundation which is Soros and</text>
  <text start="153.56" dur="8.09">there are many others and we can see at</text>
  <text start="157.16" dur="6.47">this point from these different</text>
  <text start="161.65" dur="4.11">organizations that the</text>
  <text start="163.63" dur="6.21">mation is really not going to get out</text>
  <text start="165.76" dur="7.41">there and we see that a lot of it is</text>
  <text start="169.84" dur="4.77">directed in a certain direction and we</text>
  <text start="173.17" dur="5.49">know that this is all part of many</text>
  <text start="174.61" dur="7.34">different agendas now we see that there</text>
  <text start="178.66" dur="7.83">are three liters of the BRIC nations and</text>
  <text start="181.95" dur="7.48">those nations you know are part of a</text>
  <text start="186.49" dur="4.22">separate financial structure from the</text>
  <text start="189.43" dur="6">private western central bank system</text>
  <text start="190.71" dur="7.69">there have been amassing gold and we can</text>
  <text start="195.43" dur="6.54">see right now they&amp;#39;re focusing on those</text>
  <text start="198.4" dur="6.09">people and we see that there&amp;#39;s others</text>
  <text start="201.97" dur="5.31">like poroshenko but he really hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="204.49" dur="4.92">been brought that deep into it we know</text>
  <text start="207.28" dur="5.18">it goes much deeper but they threw these</text>
  <text start="209.41" dur="5.43">other people in to make it look good</text>
  <text start="212.46" dur="5.98">because we can see at this point their</text>
  <text start="214.84" dur="6.93">agenda one of their agendas is to go</text>
  <text start="218.44" dur="7.2">after certain leaders like Putin like</text>
  <text start="221.77" dur="5.37">Zhi Jing ping and many others now this</text>
  <text start="225.64" dur="4.95">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that they&amp;#39;re all innocent</text>
  <text start="227.14" dur="6.6">because as we know that most of these</text>
  <text start="230.59" dur="5.85">leaders of different countries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="233.74" dur="5.16">corrupt most of them are very very</text>
  <text start="236.44" dur="4.71">wealthy a lot of them don&amp;#39;t want to pay</text>
  <text start="238.9" dur="4.32">taxes or most of them don&amp;#39;t want to pay</text>
  <text start="241.15" dur="3.36">taxes at all only the little people pay</text>
  <text start="243.22" dur="3.18">taxes so that&amp;#39;s why they have these</text>
  <text start="244.51" dur="5.55">offshore accounts and this is why they</text>
  <text start="246.4" dur="5.97">hide their money now if we really think</text>
  <text start="250.06" dur="3.96">the US doesn&amp;#39;t have any of this just</text>
  <text start="252.37" dur="5.39">because we don&amp;#39;t see the names well</text>
  <text start="254.02" dur="6.57">they&amp;#39;re being kept off the news on</text>
  <text start="257.76" dur="6.25">purpose but we have to remember</text>
  <text start="260.59" dur="5.16">something very important here and I</text>
  <text start="264.01" dur="4.83">mentioned this back a couple reports</text>
  <text start="265.75" dur="4.71">about operation Beluga and this is</text>
  <text start="268.84" dur="4.62">coming from a French security expert</text>
  <text start="270.46" dur="5.91">Paul drill and he says that the</text>
  <text start="273.46" dur="4.41">operation Beluga is a covert Western</text>
  <text start="276.37" dur="5.64">intelligence scheme intended to</text>
  <text start="277.87" dur="8.67">undermine Russia and its leaders and we</text>
  <text start="282.01" dur="9.719">can see this is part of the agenda now</text>
  <text start="286.54" dur="9.51">we see another part of the agenda is to</text>
  <text start="291.729" dur="5.431">cause chaos in many of the countries we</text>
  <text start="296.05" dur="3.81">see that</text>
  <text start="297.16" dur="5.66">the prime minister of Iceland he just</text>
  <text start="299.86" dur="6.75">resigned we see other Latin American</text>
  <text start="302.82" dur="5.56">officials resigning so we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="306.61" dur="4.5">see there&amp;#39;s a little bit of a purpose</text>
  <text start="308.38" dur="6.06">here and a little bit of a push to get</text>
  <text start="311.11" dur="6.21">the people inside certain countries to</text>
  <text start="314.44" dur="8.13">remove their leaders so let&amp;#39;s go through</text>
  <text start="317.32" dur="9">this what is part of their main agenda</text>
  <text start="322.57" dur="6.54">here well most likely they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="326.32" dur="5.52">create laws to break the barriers to</text>
  <text start="329.11" dur="6.15">have access to all financial info around</text>
  <text start="331.84" dur="6.9">the world so they can collect more of</text>
  <text start="335.26" dur="7.17">this tax money to bring in more revenue</text>
  <text start="338.74" dur="6.09">into the u.s. just like vodka and</text>
  <text start="342.43" dur="6.38">Obamacare and a carbon tax they like to</text>
  <text start="344.83" dur="6.75">do it shows that the u.s. leaders are</text>
  <text start="348.81" dur="4.8">completely above this and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="351.58" dur="5.09">deal in this type of criminal behavior</text>
  <text start="353.61" dur="5.64">which we know is fake phony and false</text>
  <text start="356.67" dur="4.36">they&amp;#39;re going to create more laws</text>
  <text start="359.25" dur="4.03">explaining why we need to get rid of</text>
  <text start="361.03" dur="3.21">cash because look at this all these</text>
  <text start="363.28" dur="3.78">leaders from all these different</text>
  <text start="364.24" dur="5.79">countries company and different</text>
  <text start="367.06" dur="4.98">corporations they&amp;#39;re hiding all of this</text>
  <text start="370.03" dur="5.16">in cash and you know what if everything</text>
  <text start="372.04" dur="4.95">was digital it&amp;#39;d be very easy to track</text>
  <text start="375.19" dur="4.44">all of this so it would be a good idea</text>
  <text start="376.99" dur="4.59">to get rid of cash no am I saying all of</text>
  <text start="379.63" dur="3.12">this is going to happen tomorrow no but</text>
  <text start="381.58" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re going to make the case as time</text>
  <text start="382.75" dur="6.09">goes on they want to show that the</text>
  <text start="386.59" dur="5.52">leaders of the brickz banking system</text>
  <text start="388.84" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;re corrupt they want to demonize</text>
  <text start="392.11" dur="7.38">Putin Xi Jinping and many of the other</text>
  <text start="394.96" dur="8.61">leaders they want the people in Russia</text>
  <text start="399.49" dur="5.34">in China in Latin America in Iceland</text>
  <text start="403.57" dur="4.49">because remember Iceland through the</text>
  <text start="404.83" dur="7.5">bankers into jail Iceland took back</text>
  <text start="408.06" dur="6.1">their economy and the central bankers</text>
  <text start="412.33" dur="4.71">don&amp;#39;t like this so what they want is</text>
  <text start="414.16" dur="5.79">they want these people to resign they</text>
  <text start="417.04" dur="5.7">want the people to rise up and push</text>
  <text start="419.95" dur="5.94">these people out of power this way they</text>
  <text start="422.74" dur="6.09">can swoop on in and install a puppet</text>
  <text start="425.89" dur="5.05">government it&amp;#39;s a very easy type of</text>
  <text start="428.83" dur="4.8">scenario that enable</text>
  <text start="430.94" dur="5.97">them to go in there very easily with</text>
  <text start="433.63" dur="8.14">NGOs and actually join in with the</text>
  <text start="436.91" dur="7.2">people and create an instance where the</text>
  <text start="441.77" dur="4.47">elected government is completely removed</text>
  <text start="444.11" dur="4.5">so we can see that they have many</text>
  <text start="446.24" dur="4.65">different agendas here and they are</text>
  <text start="448.61" dur="4.26">pushing this as hard as they possibly</text>
  <text start="450.89" dur="4.35">can and they&amp;#39;re going to let out more</text>
  <text start="452.87" dur="5.88">and more leaks as time goes on and to me</text>
  <text start="455.24" dur="6.45">this seems very planned and very</text>
  <text start="458.75" dur="6.24">strategic at a time that the economy is</text>
  <text start="461.69" dur="5.25">completely falling apart and they need</text>
  <text start="464.99" dur="5.94">to get into more of these countries</text>
  <text start="466.94" dur="6.78">replace the leaders spread the debt set</text>
  <text start="470.93" dur="6.81">up a central bank and we can see how</text>
  <text start="473.72" dur="6.6">this is being done at this point and if</text>
  <text start="477.74" dur="5.28">that doesn&amp;#39;t work they just demonized</text>
  <text start="480.32" dur="7.56">all these people they made them look all</text>
  <text start="483.02" dur="8.7">evil for the upcoming war now France is</text>
  <text start="487.88" dur="5.22">deploying armed guards to patrol trains</text>
  <text start="491.72" dur="4.23">at this point they saw what happened in</text>
  <text start="493.1" dur="6.41">Brussels and they&amp;#39;re not dressing them</text>
  <text start="495.95" dur="8.16">up in fatigues these are going to be</text>
  <text start="499.51" dur="7.33">civilian dressed people to blend in with</text>
  <text start="504.11" dur="5.82">the passengers and they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="506.84" dur="5.55">about three thousand armed plainclothes</text>
  <text start="509.93" dur="5.7">officers that are going to patrol all</text>
  <text start="512.39" dur="6.18">these areas and we can see more and more</text>
  <text start="515.63" dur="7.02">these countries are bringing in more and</text>
  <text start="518.57" dur="6.63">more police to the area we see the UK&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="522.65" dur="5.58">doing it we see a lot of countries in</text>
  <text start="525.2" dur="6.39">Europe are doing it France is doing it</text>
  <text start="528.23" dur="5.52">and this is going to continually spread</text>
  <text start="531.59" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;ve seen this in the past where they</text>
  <text start="533.75" dur="3.81">continually bring in more troops in</text>
  <text start="535.37" dur="4.08">create these draconian laws take away</text>
  <text start="537.56" dur="4.529">the rights of the people take away the</text>
  <text start="539.45" dur="3.95">freedoms of the people and this is what</text>
  <text start="542.089" dur="5.461">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="543.4" dur="7.48">deathly afraid of the people the people</text>
  <text start="547.55" dur="4.65">themselves figuring out that it was the</text>
  <text start="550.88" dur="3.39">government&amp;#39;s it was the central bank</text>
  <text start="552.2" dur="3.87">that caused this problem because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="554.27" dur="5.46">getting closer and closer for this</text>
  <text start="556.07" dur="6.33">entire system completely crashing and</text>
  <text start="559.73" dur="4.83">they know this and this is why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="562.4" dur="5.85">seeing a ramp up of all of this</text>
  <text start="564.56" dur="8.49">now the US has decided that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="568.25" dur="7.8">going to use the Air Force to fly drones</text>
  <text start="573.05" dur="5.94">anymore and they&amp;#39;re starting to hire</text>
  <text start="576.05" dur="5.34">private companies that are operating in</text>
  <text start="578.99" dur="5.4">Afghanistan Iraq Syria and many other</text>
  <text start="581.39" dur="5.67">countries of the two companies one is</text>
  <text start="584.39" dur="4.38">the aviation unmanned it&amp;#39;s a small</text>
  <text start="587.06" dur="4.67">veteran-owned outfit operating out of</text>
  <text start="588.77" dur="5.16">Dallas the second is General Atomics</text>
  <text start="591.73" dur="5.98">which is a large San Diego California</text>
  <text start="593.93" dur="6.24">based military contractor and we can see</text>
  <text start="597.71" dur="8.33">at this point is that they&amp;#39;re removing</text>
  <text start="600.17" dur="9.63">the people the People&amp;#39;s Armed Forces and</text>
  <text start="606.04" dur="8.489">replacing them with contractors paid</text>
  <text start="609.8" dur="8.67">mercenaries because this is what a</text>
  <text start="614.529" dur="8.341">fascist country does it gets rid of the</text>
  <text start="618.47" dur="7.04">people and replaces it with mercenaries</text>
  <text start="622.87" dur="6.7">that are connected to corporations that</text>
  <text start="625.51" dur="6.79">are receiving a huge fee because they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="629.57" dur="6.72">do whatever they&amp;#39;re paid to do the</text>
  <text start="632.3" dur="5.94">People&amp;#39;s Armed Forces they question they</text>
  <text start="636.29" dur="3.96">say I&amp;#39;m not comfortable with this and</text>
  <text start="638.24" dur="7.08">this is why we&amp;#39;re starting to see the</text>
  <text start="640.25" dur="7.41">switch right now now out in Libya we see</text>
  <text start="645.32" dur="5.1">the unity government is really pushing</text>
  <text start="647.66" dur="5.97">hard and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that the</text>
  <text start="650.42" dur="5.25">elected government in Tripoli one of the</text>
  <text start="653.63" dur="6.3">officers of the government has resigned</text>
  <text start="655.67" dur="7.53">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that the</text>
  <text start="659.93" dur="5.7">elected government might stop and they</text>
  <text start="663.2" dur="4.71">might cease operations in the country</text>
  <text start="665.63" dur="3.54">and they&amp;#39;ll just turn it all over to the</text>
  <text start="667.91" dur="3.57">unity government because there is so</text>
  <text start="669.17" dur="3.93">much force right now and we see that the</text>
  <text start="671.48" dur="3.63">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="673.1" dur="4.83">and coalition forces they are getting</text>
  <text start="675.11" dur="5.669">their way at this time now we&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="677.93" dur="5.42">about how the US and the coalition</text>
  <text start="680.779" dur="5.581">forces will be going back into Libya and</text>
  <text start="683.35" dur="4.42">this has been planned for a very long</text>
  <text start="686.36" dur="4.26">time I know they&amp;#39;re making it seem like</text>
  <text start="687.77" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;ve just come up with it but this</text>
  <text start="690.62" dur="4.58">has been planned and we can see we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="693.08" dur="5.28">getting more confirmation from Obama</text>
  <text start="695.2" dur="6.569">where he&amp;#39;s saying that the US and NATO</text>
  <text start="698.36" dur="7.19">they are going to send in troops and</text>
  <text start="701.769" dur="7.871">they&amp;#39;re going to start bombing in Libya</text>
  <text start="705.55" dur="6.849">Obama gave a convoluted statement but</text>
  <text start="709.64" dur="5.1">basically what he&amp;#39;s saying is there any</text>
  <text start="712.399" dur="5.13">advanced stages of planning a new</text>
  <text start="714.74" dur="4.92">invasion of Libya well the whole thing</text>
  <text start="717.529" dur="4.141">has been planned they were just waiting</text>
  <text start="719.66" dur="3.39">for the unity government and this is why</text>
  <text start="721.67" dur="4.56">he&amp;#39;s making the announcement right now</text>
  <text start="723.05" dur="4.76">and we can see at this point that</text>
  <text start="726.23" dur="3.93">there&amp;#39;s going to be boots on the ground</text>
  <text start="727.81" dur="4.87">they&amp;#39;re going to be bombing all</text>
  <text start="730.16" dur="4.169">different areas NATO&amp;#39;s going to be in</text>
  <text start="732.68" dur="4.2">there the coalition forces are going to</text>
  <text start="734.329" dur="5.7">be in there and we see at this point</text>
  <text start="736.88" dur="5.61">that we have another war on our hands</text>
  <text start="740.029" dur="4.651">here and this is going to spread once</text>
  <text start="742.49" dur="4.2">again because we see in Libya we see it</text>
  <text start="744.68" dur="4.5">happening in Yemen we see it happening</text>
  <text start="746.69" dur="3.839">in Lebanon it&amp;#39;s already happening and</text>
  <text start="749.18" dur="4.62">rach they&amp;#39;re still trying to get into</text>
  <text start="750.529" dur="5.731">Syria and Iran and we see at this point</text>
  <text start="753.8" dur="6.09">that they are pushing their agenda in</text>
  <text start="756.26" dur="7.97">different locations they just want to</text>
  <text start="759.89" dur="8.309">get a war started now as we can see</text>
  <text start="764.23" dur="7.299">azerbaijan and armenia they have been</text>
  <text start="768.199" dur="4.95">fighting and it seems like the cara back</text>
  <text start="771.529" dur="3.93">defense or mean they received an order</text>
  <text start="773.149" dur="4.56">to stop fighting right now there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="775.459" dur="5.31">little bit of a ceasefire a lull in the</text>
  <text start="777.709" dur="6.901">fighting and we know that john kerry he</text>
  <text start="780.769" dur="6.51">visited azerbaijan a couple days before</text>
  <text start="784.61" dur="4.5">and all of a sudden fighting broke out</text>
  <text start="787.279" dur="5.641">so we can see that they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="789.11" dur="6.36">push the agenda and have something</text>
  <text start="792.92" dur="6.18">happen in this area now this has the</text>
  <text start="795.47" dur="5.729">potential to extend beyond this entire</text>
  <text start="799.1" dur="6.21">region now Moscow does not want a</text>
  <text start="801.199" dur="6.661">full-scale war and if there is some type</text>
  <text start="805.31" dur="4.2">of war most likely Russia will be drawn</text>
  <text start="807.86" dur="4.849">into this and this is exactly what they</text>
  <text start="809.51" dur="6.24">want and we have to remember in Armenia</text>
  <text start="812.709" dur="8.19">Russia has the hundred and second</text>
  <text start="815.75" dur="8.99">military base and back in February of</text>
  <text start="820.899" dur="8.291">2016 and I reported this on episode 8 99</text>
  <text start="824.74" dur="6.849">Russia reinforced the Armenia the base</text>
  <text start="829.19" dur="3.12">there with fourth generation fighter</text>
  <text start="831.589" dur="3.241">jets</text>
  <text start="832.31" dur="7.31">and modernize helicopters they brought</text>
  <text start="834.83" dur="7.5">in mig-29s and mi-8 mt helicopters and</text>
  <text start="839.62" dur="6.61">there&amp;#39;s a base near the cannibal of</text>
  <text start="842.33" dur="6.27">armenia and they placed them there now</text>
  <text start="846.23" dur="4.47">we know that there&amp;#39;s pipelines that are</text>
  <text start="848.6" dur="3.81">going through this area they want them</text>
  <text start="850.7" dur="3.21">to go through Armenia Russia is there</text>
  <text start="852.41" dur="3.69">they want their pipeline to go through</text>
  <text start="853.91" dur="3.75">and we see at this point this would be</text>
  <text start="856.1" dur="5.1">an opportunity for the US government</text>
  <text start="857.66" dur="6.119">central bankers Turkey to push a war in</text>
  <text start="861.2" dur="5.88">this area to get Russia involved once</text>
  <text start="863.779" dur="6.421">again and we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch</text>
  <text start="867.08" dur="6.75">this situation very very carefully now</text>
  <text start="870.2" dur="5.94">out in Syria we see the Syrian army they</text>
  <text start="873.83" dur="5.07">have defeated the Islamic state anderes</text>
  <text start="876.14" dur="6.18">or they completely retook the entire</text>
  <text start="878.9" dur="6.33">area and now they&amp;#39;re pushing deep into</text>
  <text start="882.32" dur="4.86">the desert and they&amp;#39;re trying to clear</text>
  <text start="885.23" dur="6.15">out the rest of the country and they are</text>
  <text start="887.18" dur="6.03">moving eastward so we can see right now</text>
  <text start="891.38" dur="4.709">the Islamic state they are continually</text>
  <text start="893.21" dur="4.32">losing ground the proxy army for the</text>
  <text start="896.089" dur="5.491">united states government central bankers</text>
  <text start="897.53" dur="7.02">and the coalition forces they&amp;#39;re running</text>
  <text start="901.58" dur="4.41">into a problem now at this point they</text>
  <text start="904.55" dur="3.2">probably don&amp;#39;t care about the islamic</text>
  <text start="905.99" dur="4.02">state because it&amp;#39;s a no-win situation</text>
  <text start="907.75" dur="4.78">this is why they&amp;#39;re bringing in and</text>
  <text start="910.01" dur="4.53">training the Free Syrian Army this is</text>
  <text start="912.53" dur="3.63">why special forces are coming in this is</text>
  <text start="914.54" dur="4.28">why they want the coalition forces in</text>
  <text start="916.16" dur="7.35">there because again it&amp;#39;s filling a void</text>
  <text start="918.82" dur="7.54">now Syria at this point has rejected the</text>
  <text start="923.51" dur="6.57">Kurdish declaration of federal region in</text>
  <text start="926.36" dur="6.09">the North because as we know the plan of</text>
  <text start="930.08" dur="6.39">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="932.45" dur="6.99">bankers is to split up Syria into the</text>
  <text start="936.47" dur="5.7">Kurdish region Shiites Sunnis the</text>
  <text start="939.44" dur="3.99">Alawite section and they want to do this</text>
  <text start="942.17" dur="2.789">to the rest of the Middle East but right</text>
  <text start="943.43" dur="3.659">now serious saying no this is not on the</text>
  <text start="944.959" dur="5.401">drawing board we&amp;#39;re not approaching this</text>
  <text start="947.089" dur="7.641">whatsoever and as we can see as we go</text>
  <text start="950.36" dur="7.349">further into this year and as these</text>
  <text start="954.73" dur="4.78">battles in Syria remove the Islamic</text>
  <text start="957.709" dur="5.581">state the United States government</text>
  <text start="959.51" dur="6.03">central banker is really in a corner at</text>
  <text start="963.29" dur="4.169">this point it&amp;#39;s backed into a corner</text>
  <text start="965.54" dur="4.59">and we can see they&amp;#39;re formulating a lot</text>
  <text start="967.459" dur="6.18">of different plans trying to push the</text>
  <text start="970.13" dur="6.42">next major event and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>

  <text start="991.13" dur="5.759">starting to see they&amp;#39;re producing these</text>

  <text start="1073.6" dur="5.13">no choice remember back in 2008 their</text>

  <text start="1099.61" dur="3.449">quickly and we know at this point the</text>
  <text start="1101.65" dur="3.48">only thing they have is to keep the</text>
  <text start="1103.059" dur="3.87">stock market alive to make everyone</text>
  <text start="1105.13" dur="4.08">think that everything is fine they have</text>
  <text start="1106.929" dur="4.291">the ability to suppress the precious</text>

  <text start="1123.19" dur="3.96">2008 all the way up to the very end and</text>
  <text start="1125.14" dur="3.39">then when the crash was happening they</text>

  <text start="1128.53" dur="4.019">to be fine in the next couple of months</text>
  <text start="1129.76" dur="5.76">and actually got worse well the same</text>
  <text start="1132.549" dur="4.441">thing is happening right now and we can</text>
  <text start="1135.52" dur="3.42">see from everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1136.99" dur="6.29">talking about is they&amp;#39;re coming to a</text>
  <text start="1138.94" dur="9.09">point where they have no alternative but</text>
  <text start="1143.28" dur="8.26">to push this next event because they</text>
  <text start="1148.03" dur="6.87">need to completely take control of the</text>
  <text start="1151.54" dur="5.46">entire Middle Eastern area now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1154.9" dur="3.39">starting another war in Libya we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1157" dur="3.27">going to have grown troops there we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1158.29" dur="4.889">going to be bombing because as we know</text>
  <text start="1160.27" dur="5.01">that people are not going to agree with</text>

  <text start="1165.28" dur="5.07">locals do not agree with the new unity</text>
  <text start="1168.28" dur="4.05">government in Libya so this is going to</text>
  <text start="1170.35" dur="4.59">be another battle same things happening</text>
  <text start="1172.33" dur="4.41">in Yemen Lebanon we know something&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1174.94" dur="3.54">about to happen there because everything</text>
  <text start="1176.74" dur="3.08">was all the diplomats from all the</text>
  <text start="1178.48" dur="5.25">different coalition forces were</text>
  <text start="1179.82" dur="6.01">evacuated and we see they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1183.73" dur="3.96">spark different things all around this</text>
  <text start="1185.83" dur="5.04">entire region because they realize at</text>
  <text start="1187.69" dur="5.07">this point it&amp;#39;s quite impossible to take</text>
  <text start="1190.87" dur="3.929">control of all these countries it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1192.76" dur="3.36">not going to work they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="1194.799" dur="4.051">be able to keep the petrodollar propped</text>
  <text start="1196.12" dur="6.63">up so their only alternative at this</text>
  <text start="1198.85" dur="6.36">point is to create havoc everywhere and</text>
  <text start="1202.75" dur="4.89">to try to provoke war so we see the</text>
  <text start="1205.21" dur="4.02">Panama papers that have come out they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1207.64" dur="4.32">definitely using it for a certain agenda</text>
  <text start="1209.23" dur="4.38">to create protests riots and we see in</text>
  <text start="1211.96" dur="3.27">Latin America we saw it in Iceland</text>
  <text start="1213.61" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re asking their leaders to step</text>

  <text start="1218.35" dur="4.74">they want it to happen in all of these</text>

  <text start="1228.01" dur="4.65">provoke these countries to try to push</text>

  <text start="1232.66" dur="4.53">out</text>
  <text start="1233.38" dur="6.75">time and they don&amp;#39;t want the entire</text>

  <text start="1240.13" dur="6.06">this would be a problem for the central</text>
  <text start="1244.57" dur="4.53">bank the elites the US government</text>

  <text start="1249.1" dur="6.6">say wait a minute for the last eight</text>
  <text start="1252.58" dur="6.48">years they&amp;#39;ve been telling us that we</text>

  <text start="1259.06" dur="7.23">trying to tell me out of the blue that</text>
  <text start="1263.44" dur="5.37">the economy just fell apart now if</text>

  <text start="1271.26" dur="7.42">how could this possibly happen and this</text>
  <text start="1275.62" dur="5.25">is why at this point that they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1278.68" dur="4.35">to push this as hard as they can now as</text>
  <text start="1280.87" dur="4.71">we go through this summer we need to</text>
  <text start="1283.03" dur="5.22">watch certain things gold is up today if</text>
  <text start="1285.58" dur="5.13">we see gold moving up like a hundred</text>
  <text start="1288.25" dur="5.07">dollars and then it&amp;#39;s suppressed like</text>
  <text start="1290.71" dur="4.71">fifty dollars this is a signal that</text>
  <text start="1293.32" dur="6.6">things are rapidly falling apart because</text>
  <text start="1295.42" dur="8.55">gold is making new highs and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1299.92" dur="5.13">suppress it anymore which then people</text>
  <text start="1303.97" dur="2.4">around the world are going to look at</text>
  <text start="1305.05" dur="2.76">this and say okay what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="1306.37" dur="3.54">because that means the value of the</text>
  <text start="1307.81" dur="4.95">dollar is declining that means the stock</text>
  <text start="1309.91" dur="4.83">market most likely is coming down at</text>

  <text start="1315.91" dur="4.49">bouncing around as we move throughout</text>
  <text start="1318.07" dur="4.5">this year but as this starts to happen</text>
  <text start="1320.4" dur="5.68">things are going to rapidly tet fall</text>
  <text start="1322.57" dur="6.03">apart this most likely is the signal</text>
  <text start="1326.08" dur="4.65">when things really rapidly fall apart</text>
  <text start="1328.6" dur="4.08">that they&amp;#39;re going to plan the next</text>
  <text start="1330.73" dur="4.11">event and these are the things that we</text>
  <text start="1332.68" dur="4.32">need to watch at this point we could see</text>
  <text start="1334.84" dur="4.2">at this point back in january things</text>
  <text start="1337" dur="3.99">started out really really bad we&amp;#39;re</text>
