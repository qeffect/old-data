  <text start="113.05" dur="5.939">retail is having a major problem I mean</text>
  <text start="116.17" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re seeing a retail apocalypse and we</text>
  <text start="118.989" dur="3.63">knew this was coming because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="120.61" dur="4.89">tracking this for a very long time and</text>
  <text start="122.619" dur="5.071">of course the corporate media the Fed</text>
  <text start="125.5" dur="3.69">the government they were all out there</text>
  <text start="127.69" dur="3.299">telling us that it was the weather and</text>
  <text start="129.19" dur="4.14">there are other factors that were</text>
  <text start="130.989" dur="3.811">causing this problem when we started to</text>
  <text start="133.33" dur="3.659">look at it and we looked deeply into it</text>
  <text start="134.8" dur="3.96">we realized that well people weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="136.989" dur="3.511">working people didn&amp;#39;t have discretionary</text>
  <text start="138.76" dur="3.51">funds people didn&amp;#39;t have that extra</text>
  <text start="140.5" dur="4.2">money to go out and purchase the goods</text>
  <text start="142.27" dur="4.2">it had nothing to do with online had</text>
  <text start="144.7" dur="3.81">nothing to do with the weather it had to</text>
  <text start="146.47" dur="4.08">do with what was going on in the economy</text>
  <text start="148.51" dur="4.38">and we need to remember something very</text>
  <text start="150.55" dur="4.68">important right now and this is coming</text>
  <text start="152.89" dur="5.28">out of a retail consultancy</text>
  <text start="155.23" dur="5.13">Alex Partners where they looked at</text>
  <text start="158.17" dur="5.28">retail especially the food industry and</text>
  <text start="160.36" dur="6.47">a lot of the supermarket&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="163.45" dur="6.69">a lot of the retail chains like Walmart</text>
  <text start="166.83" dur="9.129">Target and others well they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="170.14" dur="8.7">propped up by the food stamp system now</text>
  <text start="175.959" dur="5.221">think about this for a second there has</text>
  <text start="178.84" dur="4.77">been an incredible increase since the</text>
  <text start="181.18" dur="5.34">Great Recession on the individuals that</text>
  <text start="183.61" dur="4.62">are on food stamps now the</text>
  <text start="186.52" dur="3.96">even these individuals needed to go on</text>
  <text start="188.23" dur="5.69">food stamps is because the system that</text>
  <text start="190.48" dur="7.38">we are in today does not produce jobs</text>
  <text start="193.92" dur="6.82">does not produce the jobs we can go out</text>
  <text start="197.86" dur="4.83">and make a living and you&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="200.74" dur="3.57">that full-time high paying job we know</text>
  <text start="202.69" dur="4.5">that manufacturing has been decreasing</text>
  <text start="204.31" dur="5.43">or no it we know now that retail a lot</text>
  <text start="207.19" dur="4.29">of the corporate high-level jobs they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="209.74" dur="3.9">been laying off we know that the low</text>
  <text start="211.48" dur="5.76">lower part-time jobs they&amp;#39;ve been laying</text>
  <text start="213.64" dur="4.92">off and right now these unemployment</text>
  <text start="217.24" dur="3.09">numbers they&amp;#39;re completely fake phony</text>
  <text start="218.56" dur="3.48">and false they&amp;#39;re manipulated to make us</text>
  <text start="220.33" dur="4.02">think that the employment sector is</text>
  <text start="222.04" dur="4.44">doing very well but a lot of people have</text>
  <text start="224.35" dur="4.17">one or two or three part-time jobs and</text>
  <text start="226.48" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re still not making the same as</text>
  <text start="228.52" dur="3.63">they were before and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="229.99" dur="4.74">people that can&amp;#39;t even find any type of</text>
  <text start="232.15" dur="4.2">work and they resort to food stamps to</text>
  <text start="234.73" dur="3.57">help them get by and we need to</text>
  <text start="236.35" dur="3.69">understand because of the way the system</text>
  <text start="238.3" dur="4.14">is designed the way the system is</text>
  <text start="240.04" dur="5.04">operating right now there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="242.44" dur="6.15">alternative but for the government to</text>
  <text start="245.08" dur="6.12">step in this is how it was designed now</text>
  <text start="248.59" dur="6.24">a lot of this money has been going to</text>
  <text start="251.2" dur="6.36">support the supermarkets been going to</text>
  <text start="254.83" dur="6.09">support the chains now if we break it</text>
  <text start="257.56" dur="6.27">down we can see that Walmart for</text>
  <text start="260.92" dur="5.43">instance well they take in around twelve</text>
  <text start="263.83" dur="5.52">point seven billion dollars now think</text>
  <text start="266.35" dur="5.88">about this if there was no food stamp</text>
  <text start="269.35" dur="4.92">program and these individuals were out</text>
  <text start="272.23" dur="6.48">of work they couldn&amp;#39;t find work or they</text>
  <text start="274.27" dur="7.65">have a part-time job these retail stores</text>
  <text start="278.71" dur="4.95">would collapse what&amp;#39;s keeping them</text>
  <text start="281.92" dur="5.54">pretty much alive right now</text>
  <text start="283.66" dur="6.69">is the food stamp industry which means</text>
  <text start="287.46" dur="4.42">the tax payers are paying for all this</text>
  <text start="290.35" dur="3.75">for these corporations to stay in</text>
  <text start="291.88" dur="4.59">business and I&amp;#39;m not knocking the people</text>
  <text start="294.1" dur="4.44">that are on food stamps they many of the</text>
  <text start="296.47" dur="3.69">people today who can&amp;#39;t find jobs or only</text>
  <text start="298.54" dur="3.72">have a part-time job who have families</text>
  <text start="300.16" dur="4.59">this is the only way they can survive I</text>
  <text start="302.26" dur="5.28">understand this we all understand this</text>
  <text start="304.75" dur="5.94">because the system right now is not</text>
  <text start="307.54" dur="4.95">designed to create incredible jobs think</text>
  <text start="310.69" dur="3.54">about all the manufacturing jobs we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="312.49" dur="4.59">lost look at all the jobs that are being</text>
  <text start="314.23" dur="5.99">lost right now in the retail industry in</text>
  <text start="317.08" dur="5.51">the corporate arena it&amp;#39;s getting worse</text>
  <text start="320.22" dur="4.56">if we look at target they receive</text>
  <text start="322.59" dur="4.8">between four point eight billion and</text>
  <text start="324.78" dur="5.1">five point three billion dollars worth</text>
  <text start="327.39" dur="4.86">of food stamp sales and what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="329.88" dur="3.78">happen as we move forward as things</text>
  <text start="332.25" dur="3.39">start to break down and we already know</text>
  <text start="333.66" dur="5.01">that there&amp;#39;s going to be cuts in this</text>
  <text start="335.64" dur="4.71">area because a lot of the government</text>
  <text start="338.67" dur="3.26">programs there&amp;#39;s going to be many many</text>
  <text start="340.35" dur="4.5">cuts because the government is broke</text>
  <text start="341.93" dur="5.2">we&amp;#39;re going to have a major major</text>
  <text start="344.85" dur="4.5">problem in the retail industry forget</text>
  <text start="347.13" dur="4.82">about online forget about all this</text>
  <text start="349.35" dur="6.09">brick-and-mortar stores the entire</text>
  <text start="351.95" dur="6.55">retail industry is going to take a huge</text>
  <text start="355.44" dur="5.22">hit because when the system starts to</text>
  <text start="358.5" dur="4.38">really completely break apart like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="360.66" dur="5.19">seeing right now we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="362.88" dur="6">things really accelerate and remember</text>
  <text start="365.85" dur="4.98">everything is intertwined right now we</text>
  <text start="368.88" dur="5.31">know the government you know provides</text>
  <text start="370.83" dur="5.31">subsidies for many businesses they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="374.19" dur="3.93">blaming if we look at food stamps we can</text>
  <text start="376.14" dur="4.92">see this is really like a subsidy for</text>
  <text start="378.12" dur="5.31">these businesses to operate if we remove</text>
  <text start="381.06" dur="4.71">this billions and billions and billions</text>
  <text start="383.43" dur="4.98">of dollars and people can&amp;#39;t find jobs</text>
  <text start="385.77" dur="4.98">these businesses will not be able to</text>
  <text start="388.41" dur="4.89">survive either so we&amp;#39;re going to see a</text>
  <text start="390.75" dur="4.71">catastrophic event hit I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="393.3" dur="4.65">already starting to see it in many many</text>
  <text start="395.46" dur="4.62">states Maine Connecticut Illinois New</text>
  <text start="397.95" dur="4.08">Jersey we&amp;#39;re starting to see the whole</text>
  <text start="400.08" dur="4.53">thing completely fall apart and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="402.03" dur="5.699">like another ten states that are right</text>
  <text start="404.61" dur="5.309">on the precipice of completely imploding</text>
  <text start="407.729" dur="5.281">on themselves and when we look at</text>
  <text start="409.919" dur="5.25">Illinois we can see they are in a huge</text>
  <text start="413.01" dur="4.2">amount of trouble right now and we know</text>
  <text start="415.169" dur="3.901">that the lawmakers in Illinois well they</text>
  <text start="417.21" dur="4.92">fail to agree on how to compromise all</text>
  <text start="419.07" dur="4.89">the government&amp;#39;s deficits and we could</text>
  <text start="422.13" dur="6.84">see right now they&amp;#39;re very close to a</text>
  <text start="423.96" dur="7.11">junk rated US state a federal judge Joan</text>
  <text start="428.97" dur="4.8">left count in Chicago ordered Illinois</text>
  <text start="431.07" dur="5.159">to come up with hundreds of millions of</text>
  <text start="433.77" dur="4.32">dollars it owes in Medicaid payments</text>
  <text start="436.229" dur="5.281">that state officials say the government</text>
  <text start="438.09" dur="7.41">just doesn&amp;#39;t have and judge Lefko</text>
  <text start="441.51" dur="6.39">ordered the state to make 586 million in</text>
  <text start="445.5" dur="4.8">monthly payments as well as another two</text>
  <text start="447.9" dur="6.269">billion towards a thrilled three billion</text>

  <text start="458.3" dur="7.389">billion dollars approaching 15 billion</text>
  <text start="462.659" dur="6.23">this is um it&amp;#39;s crippling the entire</text>
  <text start="465.689" dur="6.871">state and we see at this point that</text>
  <text start="468.889" dur="6.011">Illinois they&amp;#39;re in a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="472.56" dur="5.46">trouble they&amp;#39;re collapsing right in</text>
  <text start="474.9" dur="5.879">front of us now the governor well he</text>
  <text start="478.02" dur="6.209">decided to do something completely crazy</text>
  <text start="480.779" dur="6.211">he agreed to hike the personal income</text>
  <text start="484.229" dur="5.25">tax rate to four point nine five percent</text>
  <text start="486.99" dur="4.829">from three point seven five percent and</text>
  <text start="489.479" dur="5.101">a corporate income tax rate well that</text>
  <text start="491.819" dur="5.88">will rise from seven percent from five</text>
  <text start="494.58" dur="6.75">point two five percent now is this going</text>
  <text start="497.699" dur="5.161">to help the situation well most likely</text>
  <text start="501.33" dur="3.119">not we know that like the Chicago</text>
  <text start="502.86" dur="3.57">schools well they&amp;#39;re not going to get</text>
  <text start="504.449" dur="5.131">fixed the hikes will not shore up</text>
  <text start="506.43" dur="5.669">pension plans within one month of tax</text>
  <text start="509.58" dur="4.399">hikes public unions will ask for more</text>
  <text start="512.099" dur="3.721">money and people will leave the state</text>
  <text start="513.979" dur="4.87">corporations will start to leave the</text>
  <text start="515.82" dur="4.529">sate how do we know this we saw what was</text>
  <text start="518.849" dur="3.81">happening in Connecticut where</text>
  <text start="520.349" dur="4.201">corporations that okay we can&amp;#39;t make it</text>
  <text start="522.659" dur="4.711">here anymore we need to leave the taxes</text>
  <text start="524.55" dur="5.37">are too high we&amp;#39;re out we see in New</text>
  <text start="527.37" dur="3.959">Jersey Governor Chris Christie declared</text>
  <text start="529.92" dur="4.289">a state of emergency in the state and</text>
  <text start="531.329" dur="4.681">announced a partial state government</text>
  <text start="534.209" dur="3.271">shutdown and it looks like the same</text>
  <text start="536.01" dur="2.759">thing is happening that&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="537.48" dur="2.549">Illinois same thing happening in</text>
  <text start="538.769" dur="3.541">Connecticut the same thing will happen</text>
  <text start="540.029" dur="3.901">in Maine it looks like the legislators</text>
  <text start="542.31" dur="4.32">will they fail to reach an agreement by</text>
  <text start="543.93" dur="4.409">the deadline for their budget and right</text>
  <text start="546.63" dur="4.889">now police well they&amp;#39;re turning away</text>
  <text start="548.339" dur="4.891">vehicles and people on bicycles at the</text>
  <text start="551.519" dur="4.921">island Beach State Park in Ocean County</text>
  <text start="553.23" dur="5.969">it is closed and public workers right</text>
  <text start="556.44" dur="5.899">now the governor said don&amp;#39;t expect to</text>
  <text start="559.199" dur="6.841">get any back pay and we can see that</text>
  <text start="562.339" dur="5.891">state by state by state things are</text>
  <text start="566.04" dur="5.51">completely breaking down and it take</text>
  <text start="568.23" dur="7.219">this a step further well we have a</text>
  <text start="571.55" dur="7.659">pension national crisis on our hand</text>
  <text start="575.449" dur="6.241">America&amp;#39;s pension system as we know we</text>
  <text start="579.209" dur="5.601">discussed this before is completely</text>
  <text start="581.69" dur="5.53">underfunded and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="584.81" dur="3.55">that from all these states Illinois</text>
  <text start="587.22" dur="2.9">California</text>
  <text start="588.36" dur="4.53">New Jersey Connecticut Massachusetts</text>
  <text start="590.12" dur="6.909">Kentucky and eight other states they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="592.89" dur="6.33">very vulnerable to this pension problem</text>
  <text start="597.029" dur="5.851">and there are other states that are</text>
  <text start="599.22" dur="6.989">teetering on this problem now this is</text>
  <text start="602.88" dur="5.639">not a distant concern it is a concern</text>
  <text start="606.209" dur="5.701">that is already having we&amp;#39;re already in</text>
  <text start="608.519" dur="5.731">the crisis now according to data</text>

  <text start="614.25" dur="6.089">public and private combined we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="616.41" dur="6.66">roughly 27% underfunded at the end of</text>
  <text start="620.339" dur="6.421">last year and when we look at the data</text>
  <text start="623.07" dur="6.63">more closely we can see that America&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="626.76" dur="6.329">public pensions they&amp;#39;re in a six</text>
  <text start="629.7" dur="6.75">trillion dollar abyss I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="633.089" dur="6.481">absolutely ridiculous now remember these</text>
  <text start="636.45" dur="5.97">pension systems they were built upon the</text>
  <text start="639.57" dur="5.579">idea that these investments were going</text>
  <text start="642.42" dur="5.099">to yield around 7.5 percent annual</text>
  <text start="645.149" dur="4.62">returns but because the interest rates</text>
  <text start="647.519" dur="5.43">are so low and everything else that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="649.769" dur="7.651">going on the average public pension plan</text>
  <text start="652.949" dur="8.7">returned just 1.5% last year the pension</text>
  <text start="657.42" dur="6.72">crisis in America is a silent crisis no</text>
  <text start="661.649" dur="5.18">one&amp;#39;s really talking about it until it</text>
  <text start="664.14" dur="5.069">actually hits and we can see that</text>

  <text start="689.37" dur="6.149">the economy today is not doing as well</text>
  <text start="693.51" dur="3.78">as the corporate media the fed the</text>
  <text start="695.519" dur="4.591">government wants us to believe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="697.29" dur="6">doing it is built on an illusion and the</text>
  <text start="700.11" dur="6">illusion is slowly cracking it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="703.29" dur="4.89">disappearing now the Atlanta Fed and the</text>
  <text start="706.11" dur="5.94">New York Fed they do their estimates on</text>
  <text start="708.18" dur="5.07">GDP and we can see that the Atlanta Fed</text>
  <text start="712.05" dur="3.69">and the New York Fed they were</text>
  <text start="713.25" dur="3.839">completely separate and apart now it</text>
  <text start="715.74" dur="4.65">looks like they&amp;#39;re converging and it</text>
  <text start="717.089" dur="5.431">looks like the New York Fed they&amp;#39;re now</text>
  <text start="720.39" dur="4.71">cast remains around</text>
  <text start="722.52" dur="4.86">point nine percent the Atlanta Fed their</text>
  <text start="725.1" dur="4.65">GDP now well it is dipped to two point</text>
  <text start="727.38" dur="4.83">seven percent and looks like both of</text>
  <text start="729.75" dur="5.19">these numbers they&amp;#39;re coming to a point</text>
  <text start="732.21" dur="4.95">where they&amp;#39;re huge spread before where</text>
  <text start="734.94" dur="4.74">one was at like one point five percent</text>
  <text start="737.16" dur="5.01">one was at like three percent well that</text>
  <text start="739.68" dur="6.81">spread is now narrowing and we&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="742.17" dur="6.45">to a more of a estimate that reflects</text>
  <text start="746.49" dur="4.89">what&amp;#39;s really going on now remember this</text>
  <text start="748.62" dur="6.99">is still manipulated this is still not</text>
  <text start="751.38" dur="6.27">the real GDP numbers and even if we meet</text>
  <text start="755.61" dur="5.1">at two percent or one point nine percent</text>
  <text start="757.65" dur="5.07">or one point seven percent what they do</text>
  <text start="760.71" dur="4.29">is they play with the numbers they</text>
  <text start="762.72" dur="3.93">revise numbers and we can see this is</text>
  <text start="765" dur="4.77">what they did to the first quarter they</text>
  <text start="766.65" dur="6.57">revised the numbers and they create the</text>
  <text start="769.77" dur="5.7">illusion that now the GDP numbers are in</text>
  <text start="773.22" dur="5.58">line with what the economy is doing and</text>
  <text start="775.47" dur="6.45">again the economy is nowhere near that</text>
  <text start="778.8" dur="6">three percent we&amp;#39;re so far below that</text>
  <text start="781.92" dur="5.61">and this is completely manipulated we</text>
  <text start="784.8" dur="5.88">need to remember they recalculated the</text>
  <text start="787.53" dur="4.41">GDP going back to 1929 they added</text>
  <text start="790.68" dur="3.57">research and development and other</text>
  <text start="791.94" dur="3.99">things and they recalculate it all the</text>
  <text start="794.25" dur="4.14">way up to the present time they also</text>
  <text start="795.93" dur="5.28">included Obamacare the Obamacare tax</text>
  <text start="798.39" dur="4.5">anything that they can throw in there to</text>
  <text start="801.21" dur="2.91">make the numbers better this is what</text>
  <text start="802.89" dur="2.82">they did and then they go back and they</text>
  <text start="804.12" dur="2.85">revise the numbers to make it look like</text>
  <text start="805.71" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s a lot better than it really is</text>
  <text start="806.97" dur="3.72">but what we see the Fed doing what we</text>
  <text start="809.43" dur="5.01">see the corporate media doing right now</text>
  <text start="810.69" dur="6.93">they&amp;#39;re building the case to convince us</text>
  <text start="814.44" dur="5.31">on one hand that the economy is fine</text>
  <text start="817.62" dur="5.37">this is what the Fed does they tell us</text>
  <text start="819.75" dur="5.04">that there&amp;#39;s you know no recession</text>
  <text start="822.99" dur="3.51">headed our way there&amp;#39;s no collapse</text>
  <text start="824.79" dur="4.11">headed our way we&amp;#39;re not going to see a</text>
  <text start="826.5" dur="4.17">crisis in our lifetime this is what they</text>
  <text start="828.9" dur="3.96">said back in 2008 they were not</text>
  <text start="830.67" dur="4.95">forecasting any type of recession Janet</text>
  <text start="832.86" dur="4.82">Yellen today said she doesn&amp;#39;t predict</text>
  <text start="835.62" dur="4.95">any type of crisis within our lifetime</text>
  <text start="837.68" dur="4.93">so we can see this is what the Fed does</text>
  <text start="840.57" dur="4.38">they pretend they keep us in this</text>
  <text start="842.61" dur="5.58">illusion that everything is fine then we</text>
  <text start="844.95" dur="5.25">have the corporate media where part of</text>
  <text start="848.19" dur="3.72">the corporate media they&amp;#39;re on track to</text>
  <text start="850.2" dur="4.05">say that you know because of Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="851.91" dur="3.64">policies and what he&amp;#39;s doing the economy</text>
  <text start="854.25" dur="3.76">looks like it&amp;#39;s lip</text>
  <text start="855.55" dur="5.13">it&amp;#39;s not doing as well and I see in time</text>
  <text start="858.01" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re talking about climate change and</text>
  <text start="860.68" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re saying how climate changes we</text>
  <text start="862.54" dur="6.06">backed out of the climate Accord this</text>
  <text start="864.97" dur="6.06">could spark another great recession I</text>
  <text start="868.6" dur="5.4">mean think about what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="871.03" dur="6.39">right now they&amp;#39;re grasping at anything</text>
  <text start="874" dur="6.09">they possibly can to convince us of why</text>
  <text start="877.42" dur="4.35">this economy is going to fall apart we</text>
  <text start="880.09" dur="4.38">know why it&amp;#39;s going to fall apart it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="881.77" dur="5.16">built on an illusion it&amp;#39;s built on one</text>
  <text start="884.47" dur="5.01">gigantic manipulation think about what</text>
  <text start="886.93" dur="4.23">the corporate media did back when retail</text>
  <text start="889.48" dur="4.38">wasn&amp;#39;t doing well and everyone believed</text>
  <text start="891.16" dur="5.31">it except us I mean just think back to</text>
  <text start="893.86" dur="4.8">those times after the holiday season</text>
  <text start="896.47" dur="3.3">like in January February where they said</text>
  <text start="898.66" dur="2.61">well people didn&amp;#39;t go to the</text>
  <text start="899.77" dur="4.29">brick-and-mortar stores because it was</text>
  <text start="901.27" dur="4.17">snowy it was rainy it was icy and of</text>
  <text start="904.06" dur="2.76">course this was only happening in one</text>
  <text start="905.44" dur="3.51">part of the country the rest of the</text>
  <text start="906.82" dur="4.88">country was sunny and beautiful but they</text>
  <text start="908.95" dur="5.82">tried to convince the country the world</text>
  <text start="911.7" dur="5.05">everyone that retail wasn&amp;#39;t doing well</text>
  <text start="914.77" dur="4.41">the holiday season wasn&amp;#39;t doing well</text>
  <text start="916.75" dur="5.61">because it was either too warm or it was</text>
  <text start="919.18" dur="5.46">too cold and this is why then they went</text>
  <text start="922.36" dur="4.98">on to well everyone is moving to online</text>
  <text start="924.64" dur="4.2">sales but when we can took all the</text>
  <text start="927.34" dur="3.21">numbers from online sales and the</text>
  <text start="928.84" dur="3.99">brick-and-mortar stores and combine them</text>
  <text start="930.55" dur="3.24">sales were not really up because if</text>
  <text start="932.83" dur="4.08">everyone was switching from</text>
  <text start="933.79" dur="6.45">brick-and-mortar to online the entire</text>
  <text start="936.91" dur="6.39">retail industry should be incredible not</text>
  <text start="940.24" dur="4.77">happening all that fell apart now</text>
  <text start="943.3" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re trying to make the excuse of why</text>
  <text start="945.01" dur="4.08">the economy&amp;#39;s going to be falling apart</text>
  <text start="947.02" dur="3.87">and they&amp;#39;re saying well it&amp;#39;s because of</text>
  <text start="949.09" dur="3.51">that policy it&amp;#39;s because of the cuts in</text>
  <text start="950.89" dur="3.99">government well it&amp;#39;s because climate</text>
  <text start="952.6" dur="5.52">change they&amp;#39;re trying to create a</text>
