  <text start="86.619" dur="4.54">sometimes it gets a little confusing we</text>
  <text start="89.72" dur="4.649">think that things should happen in a</text>
  <text start="91.159" dur="5.181">certain way Trump should make deals but</text>
  <text start="94.369" dur="5.82">the plan is not always straightforward</text>

  <text start="102.17" dur="3.719">discussing that in just a moment but</text>
  <text start="104.359" dur="4.89">first I wanted to talk about Joe Biden</text>
  <text start="105.889" dur="6.3">here now while he was speaking to some</text>
  <text start="109.249" dur="6.381">reporters this week Biden said that the</text>
  <text start="112.189" dur="6.63">economy is collapsing because of Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="115.63" dur="4.599">presidency now that doesn&amp;#39;t even make</text>
  <text start="118.819" dur="4.021">sense because if you look at the stock</text>
  <text start="120.229" dur="3.81">market you look at the GDP numbers you</text>
  <text start="122.84" dur="3.93">look at the unemployment in which you</text>
  <text start="124.039" dur="5.041">look at all the statistical numbers that</text>
  <text start="126.77" dur="6.57">does not show that the economy is</text>
  <text start="129.08" dur="7.86">collapsing he went on to say that look</text>
  <text start="133.34" dur="5.91">this is three years later the world has</text>
  <text start="136.94" dur="4.98">changed President Trump has turned it</text>
  <text start="139.25" dur="5.13">upside down internationally he&amp;#39;s turned</text>
  <text start="141.92" dur="4.41">it upside down economically people are</text>
  <text start="144.38" dur="3.63">hurting badly there&amp;#39;s no response</text>
  <text start="146.33" dur="3.06">we faced a different problem ten years</text>
  <text start="148.01" dur="4.08">ago when the economy collapsed because</text>
  <text start="149.39" dur="4.709">of Republican policies now we face a</text>
  <text start="152.09" dur="3.33">problem that the economy as well as the</text>
  <text start="154.099" dur="4.441">soul of this country is collapsing</text>
  <text start="155.42" dur="4.44">because of this presidency so it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="158.54" dur="5.22">different problem but with the same</text>
  <text start="159.86" dur="6.75">basic principle now first of all</text>
  <text start="163.76" dur="5.64">he&amp;#39;s trying to push against the economic</text>
  <text start="166.61" dur="4.799">narrative we know that Trump and the</text>
  <text start="169.4" dur="5.07">Patriots they control the economic</text>
  <text start="171.409" dur="5.761">narrative they can&amp;#39;t touch it yes</text>
  <text start="174.47" dur="5.579">they&amp;#39;re going to try but they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="177.17" dur="4.98">hit a brick wall and this is a terrible</text>
  <text start="180.049" dur="3.69">terrible thing for them because they</text>
  <text start="182.15" dur="3.93">need to show that they will make the</text>
  <text start="183.739" dur="3.901">economy better but how are you going to</text>
  <text start="186.08" dur="5.46">do this when unemployment is really</text>
  <text start="187.64" dur="5.879">really low GDP numbers are very good the</text>
  <text start="191.54" dur="3.3">stock market is at all-time highs</text>
  <text start="193.519" dur="3.571">yes it&amp;#39;s come down a little bit but</text>
  <text start="194.84" dur="4.56">watch it&amp;#39;s gonna go right back up the</text>
  <text start="197.09" dur="4.369">Fed is cutting rates right now this is</text>
  <text start="199.4" dur="5.429">everything that was done before and</text>
  <text start="201.459" dur="4.831">everyone the mainstream media deep state</text>
  <text start="204.829" dur="4.261">the central bank they all loved it and</text>
  <text start="206.29" dur="5.14">they use this to tell the people that</text>
  <text start="209.09" dur="5.009">everything was great Trump in the</text>
  <text start="211.43" dur="8.88">Patriots they&amp;#39;re doing the same exact</text>
  <text start="214.099" dur="8.401">thing the candidates cannot touch the</text>
  <text start="220.31" dur="4.38">economic narrative but there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="222.5" dur="6.66">else that Biden is saying the other</text>
  <text start="224.69" dur="6.93">message here is that Trump within the</text>
  <text start="229.16" dur="4.169">last three years he&amp;#39;s changed the</text>
  <text start="231.62" dur="3.929">economic landscape</text>
  <text start="233.329" dur="5.431">he removed the globalist trade deal</text>
  <text start="235.549" dur="5.041">changed regulations called out the</text>
  <text start="238.76" dur="3.96">central bank reworked the trade deal</text>
  <text start="240.59" dur="6.72">stopped China trade practices with the</text>
  <text start="242.72" dur="7.199">u.s. used tariffs as leverage he&amp;#39;s taken</text>
  <text start="247.31" dur="3.75">the entire economic landscape and turned</text>
  <text start="249.919" dur="4.65">it upside down</text>
  <text start="251.06" dur="6.47">everything that they had planned for the</text>
  <text start="254.569" dur="6.121">globalist economy has been stripped away</text>
  <text start="257.53" dur="7.06">this is what Biden is really talking</text>
  <text start="260.69" dur="6.539">about and now Trump is reworking trade</text>
  <text start="264.59" dur="4.07">deals making bilateral trade agreements</text>
  <text start="267.229" dur="5.431">with all these different countries</text>
  <text start="268.66" dur="7.05">reworking the trade deal with China now</text>
  <text start="272.66" dur="6.78">he also just stepped in with the EU and</text>
  <text start="275.71" dur="5.61">changed that trade deal Trump and US</text>
  <text start="279.44" dur="4.44">Trade Representative Robert light Heiser</text>
  <text start="281.32" dur="4.9">announced a new US trade deal with</text>
  <text start="283.88" dur="5.069">Europe for the duty-free export of US</text>
  <text start="286.22" dur="5.16">beef the Trump administration signed a</text>
  <text start="288.949" dur="5.97">breakthrough agreement that will make it</text>
  <text start="291.38" dur="5.88">easier to export export American beef</text>
  <text start="294.919" dur="4.921">into the European Union</text>
  <text start="297.26" dur="5.33">Trump said we&amp;#39;ve been under negotiation</text>
  <text start="299.84" dur="5.49">for quite a while and our beef farmers</text>
  <text start="302.59" dur="4.93">we didn&amp;#39;t think they were being treated</text>
  <text start="305.33" dur="4.68">fair but the European Union stepped up</text>
  <text start="307.52" dur="4.62">and we appreciate it this is a</text>
  <text start="310.01" dur="4.59">tremendous victory for American farmers</text>
  <text start="312.14" dur="3.96">ranchers and of course European</text>
  <text start="314.6" dur="4.38">consumers because American beef is</text>
  <text start="316.1" dur="4.44">considered the best in the world the</text>
  <text start="318.98" dur="3.27">agreement we signed today will lower</text>
  <text start="320.54" dur="3.99">trade barriers in Europe and expand</text>
  <text start="322.25" dur="5.55">access for American farmers and ranchers</text>
  <text start="324.53" dur="6.09">in year one duty-free American beef</text>
  <text start="327.8" dur="5.01">exports to the EU will increase by 46</text>
  <text start="330.62" dur="4.08">percent over seven years they were</text>
  <text start="332.81" dur="4.86">increased by another 90 percent in total</text>
  <text start="334.7" dur="6.06">the duty-free exports will rise from 150</text>
  <text start="337.67" dur="7.29">million to 420 million an increase of</text>
  <text start="340.76" dur="6.15">over 180 percent he said my</text>
  <text start="344.96" dur="3.48">administration is standing up for our</text>
  <text start="346.91" dur="3.99">farmers or ranchers like never before</text>
  <text start="348.44" dur="5.43">we&amp;#39;re protecting our farmers were doing</text>
  <text start="350.9" dur="4.71">it in many ways including with China you</text>
  <text start="353.87" dur="3.15">may have read a little bit about China</text>
  <text start="355.61" dur="3.89">lately and we&amp;#39;ll get into that a little</text>
  <text start="357.02" dur="5.73">bit later agricultural products and</text>
  <text start="359.5" dur="4.96">exports they have increased by more than</text>
  <text start="362.75" dur="4.8">10 billion a beef exports have increased</text>
  <text start="364.46" dur="5.25">by 31 percent and another major win we</text>
  <text start="367.55" dur="4.71">fully open the Japanese market to US</text>
  <text start="369.71" dur="7.14">beef we also open markets in Morocco</text>
  <text start="372.26" dur="9.09">Australia and other countries Trump he</text>
  <text start="376.85" dur="8.57">is pushing the envelope here getting</text>
  <text start="381.35" dur="10.32">everything prepared for the new economy</text>
  <text start="385.42" dur="9.76">we need to export we need trade because</text>
  <text start="391.67" dur="5.45">once the Federal Reserve Note is gone</text>
  <text start="395.18" dur="5.81">and it&amp;#39;s no longer the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="397.12" dur="8.68">we will need trade agreements in place</text>
  <text start="400.99" dur="7.93">now Trump went on to say that China has</text>
  <text start="405.8" dur="6.99">to do a lot more to turn things around</text>
  <text start="408.92" dur="6.33">and remember Trump placed new tariffs on</text>
  <text start="412.79" dur="4.65">China he&amp;#39;s using tariffs as leverage and</text>
  <text start="415.25" dur="4.11">this is all being done on purpose now</text>
  <text start="417.44" dur="3.93">once again people are looking at this</text>
  <text start="419.36" dur="4.29">saying well look Trump hasn&amp;#39;t made the</text>
  <text start="421.37" dur="4.08">China deal see it&amp;#39;s not working it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="423.65" dur="3.84">everything is not what you said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="425.45" dur="4.11">going to be think about this for a</text>
  <text start="427.49" dur="3.09">second think about the plan what is the</text>
  <text start="429.56" dur="2.669">goal of</text>
  <text start="430.58" dur="4.679">Trump in the Patriots what are they</text>
  <text start="432.229" dur="4.791">trying to achieve here what we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="435.259" dur="4.201">central bank system right</text>
  <text start="437.02" dur="4.09">we don&amp;#39;t have trade right now we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="439.46" dur="5.729">have good trade with the rest of the</text>
  <text start="441.11" dur="7.35">world we have global trade that was set</text>
  <text start="445.189" dur="5.611">up Trump is changing this the globalists</text>
  <text start="448.46" dur="4.009">have moved businesses and manufacturing</text>
  <text start="450.8" dur="3.929">out of the United States</text>
  <text start="452.469" dur="4.061">what is Trump in the patriot trying to</text>
  <text start="454.729" dur="3.541">do they&amp;#39;re trying to bring this back</text>
  <text start="456.53" dur="3.72">where do most of the businesses go they</text>
  <text start="458.27" dur="5.19">went to China yes some went to other</text>
  <text start="460.25" dur="6.479">countries so what is Trump doing what is</text>
  <text start="463.46" dur="6.03">the plan here he removed the globalist</text>
  <text start="466.729" dur="5.511">trade deals he created new bilateral</text>
  <text start="469.49" dur="5.519">trade deals with countries he&amp;#39;s removing</text>
  <text start="472.24" dur="4.69">unfair trade practices he&amp;#39;s calling out</text>
  <text start="475.009" dur="5.041">the World Trade Organization and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="476.93" dur="6">telling the world we need to rework this</text>
  <text start="480.05" dur="4.769">completely we&amp;#39;re now shipping</text>
  <text start="482.93" dur="5.299">agricultural products and meat products</text>
  <text start="484.819" dur="6.78">to help the farmers increase exports and</text>
  <text start="488.229" dur="5.261">for years the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="491.599" dur="4.981">bank they&amp;#39;ve been pushing businesses</text>
  <text start="493.49" dur="4.889">manufacturers out of the US this was</text>
  <text start="496.58" dur="4.829">part of their bigger plan for the world</text>
  <text start="498.379" dur="5.85">the jobs and plants they were mostly</text>
  <text start="501.409" dur="6.57">moved to China and some other countries</text>
  <text start="504.229" dur="6.87">but mostly China now Trump the Patriots</text>
  <text start="507.979" dur="6.48">their mission is to do what to bring</text>
  <text start="511.099" dur="6.62">back businesses and manufacturers to</text>
  <text start="514.459" dur="6.21">United States or move them out of China</text>
  <text start="517.719" dur="5.581">think about that for a second how would</text>
  <text start="520.669" dur="8.04">you do that in a short period of time</text>
  <text start="523.3" dur="9.399">well use tariffs you say we want a brand</text>
  <text start="528.709" dur="6.12">new trade deal and you put pressure on</text>
  <text start="532.699" dur="5.191">countries now do you want to make that</text>
  <text start="534.829" dur="5.88">deal very very quickly no you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="537.89" dur="5.16">because this will not help you reach</text>
  <text start="540.709" dur="3">that goal it will be completely</text>
  <text start="543.05" dur="3.719">impossible</text>
  <text start="543.709" dur="6.841">I don&amp;#39;t believe Trump wants to make a</text>
  <text start="546.769" dur="6.991">deal that quickly with China if he did</text>
  <text start="550.55" dur="6.469">he would think about what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="553.76" dur="7.07">he&amp;#39;s continually placing tariffs on</text>
  <text start="557.019" dur="7.261">China using it as leverage</text>
  <text start="560.83" dur="4.95">pushing countries out of China into some</text>
  <text start="564.28" dur="4.74">other countries which he&amp;#39;s already made</text>
  <text start="565.78" dur="4.65">deals with or having them move back to</text>
  <text start="569.02" dur="5.07">the United States because once they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="570.43" dur="6.42">out of China it will be too expensive to</text>
  <text start="574.09" dur="5.97">move back into China think about that</text>
  <text start="576.85" dur="6.39">for a second Trump has no deal with</text>
  <text start="580.06" dur="7.17">China is using tariffs and companies are</text>
  <text start="583.24" dur="6.45">moving out of China how do you bring</text>
  <text start="587.23" dur="4.5">back businesses and manufacturers back</text>
  <text start="589.69" dur="6.44">to the United States in a very short</text>
  <text start="591.73" dur="8.67">period of time you use tariffs you use</text>
  <text start="596.13" dur="8.44">leverage remember optics are very very</text>
  <text start="600.4" dur="5.82">important and the whole point of Trump</text>
  <text start="604.57" dur="4.02">saying listen we make a deal we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="606.22" dur="5.16">make a deal I don&amp;#39;t really care he</text>
  <text start="608.59" dur="5.82">doesn&amp;#39;t care right now because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="611.38" dur="8.79">pushing the companies out of China this</text>
  <text start="614.41" dur="6.72">is the goal this is part of the plan now</text>
  <text start="620.17" dur="4.67">think about it</text>
  <text start="621.13" dur="7.59">from the other side Xi Jinping</text>
  <text start="624.84" dur="6.58">China they know that companies will be</text>
  <text start="628.72" dur="5.91">leaving why would they just let this</text>
  <text start="631.42" dur="6.9">happen why would they just let all these</text>
  <text start="634.63" dur="6.36">companies just leave China and many more</text>
  <text start="638.32" dur="4.32">companies are thinking about moving out</text>
  <text start="640.99" dur="4.77">and once they move out it will be too</text>
  <text start="642.64" dur="6.81">expensive to move back in this is all</text>
  <text start="645.76" dur="6.06">part of the plan now Trump might not go</text>
  <text start="649.45" dur="4.35">the entire year maybe he&amp;#39;ll wait into</text>
  <text start="651.82" dur="4.11">the middle of 2020 before he makes that</text>
  <text start="653.8" dur="4.74">deal with China or maybe he&amp;#39;ll wait a</text>
  <text start="655.93" dur="5.75">little bit a little while after there is</text>
  <text start="658.54" dur="6.3">no rush actually he rather have</text>
  <text start="661.68" dur="5.95">companies move out of China than</text>
  <text start="664.84" dur="6.69">actually make a deal right now but he</text>
  <text start="667.63" dur="7.22">will make a deal think about what is</text>
  <text start="671.53" dur="7.5">happening here he&amp;#39;s reversing everything</text>
  <text start="674.85" dur="6.88">the globalists have set up and by the</text>
  <text start="679.03" dur="5.19">rest of the world watching this he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="681.73" dur="6.54">letting them know the same thing will</text>
  <text start="684.22" dur="6.66">happen to you unless you make a trade</text>
  <text start="688.27" dur="6.35">deal with me and I&amp;#39;m talking about with</text>
