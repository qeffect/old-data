  <text start="107.57" dur="9.939">to back change or face public wrath and</text>
  <text start="113.149" dur="7.481">we see right now that the brexit is</text>

  <text start="126.209" dur="6.571">that the public they want out of the EU</text>
  <text start="129.479" dur="6.151">and we can see that everything they said</text>
  <text start="132.78" dur="4.5">when the people are voting where the</text>
  <text start="135.63" dur="3.93">economy was gonna fall apart</text>
  <text start="137.28" dur="3.75">business was just gonna stop its comes</text>
  <text start="139.56" dur="4.98">it was gonna come to a screeching halt</text>
  <text start="141.03" dur="6.84">none of it none of it happened it was a</text>
  <text start="144.54" dur="6.449">complete lie now we know the economy is</text>
  <text start="147.87" dur="5.85">built on a gigantic illusion we know</text>
  <text start="150.989" dur="5.641">that eventually it will collapse but</text>
  <text start="153.72" dur="6.15">what they were saying was a complete lie</text>
  <text start="156.63" dur="5.99">everything didn&amp;#39;t collapse and here we</text>
  <text start="159.87" dur="6.9">are today where they&amp;#39;re getting ready to</text>
  <text start="162.62" dur="7.6">implement article 50 come March and we</text>
  <text start="166.77" dur="6.27">see at this point that the elite they</text>
  <text start="170.22" dur="5.7">are stuck at this point because the</text>
  <text start="173.04" dur="5.789">public is screaming out saying we want</text>
  <text start="175.92" dur="4.739">change and it&amp;#39;s not the change the</text>
  <text start="178.829" dur="3.041">government the elite want it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="180.659" dur="3.22">change that the people</text>
  <text start="181.87" dur="4.289">want and that&amp;#39;s completely different</text>
  <text start="183.879" dur="7.051">from what the elite and the government</text>
  <text start="186.159" dur="6.75">want to do we see here in the u.s. us</text>
  <text start="190.93" dur="6.21">economic expectations will they have</text>
  <text start="192.909" dur="5.761">soared to 15-year highs and of course</text>
  <text start="197.14" dur="5.09">they&amp;#39;re all out there saying it&amp;#39;s Trump</text>
  <text start="198.67" dur="5.97">euphoria it&amp;#39;s unbelievable but the real</text>
  <text start="202.23" dur="6.7">current economic situation</text>
  <text start="204.64" dur="6.14">well that is declining so when we look</text>
  <text start="208.93" dur="4.32">at what is happening here</text>
  <text start="210.78" dur="4.78">Bloomberg&amp;#39;s economic expectation is</text>
  <text start="213.25" dur="4.89">shooting up and Bloomberg&amp;#39;s current</text>
  <text start="215.56" dur="6.45">economic situation is declining at the</text>
  <text start="218.14" dur="6.87">same time and this shows us that yeah</text>
  <text start="222.01" dur="4.92">you might be hopeful but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="225.01" dur="4.17">happening in the real economy well</text>
  <text start="226.93" dur="5.55">that&amp;#39;s really deteriorating it&amp;#39;s falling</text>
  <text start="229.18" dur="6.63">apart now we see initial jobless claims</text>
  <text start="232.48" dur="6.69">they have crashed to forty four year</text>
  <text start="235.81" dur="6.509">lows and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="239.17" dur="6.89">this is that continuous claims well they</text>
  <text start="242.319" dur="6.78">are surging so what we have right now is</text>
  <text start="246.06" dur="5.47">1.74 million people were continuing to</text>
  <text start="249.099" dur="5.851">claim jobless benefits before Donald</text>
  <text start="251.53" dur="6.359">Trump was elected in a mysterious fluke</text>
  <text start="254.95" dur="5.009">of statistical smoke and mirrors last</text>
  <text start="257.889" dur="5.221">week&amp;#39;s two point four six million print</text>
  <text start="259.959" dur="5.64">for continuing claims suggests over</text>
  <text start="263.11" dur="6.57">seven hundred thousand more people are</text>
  <text start="265.599" dur="7.891">now claiming unemployment benefits than</text>
  <text start="269.68" dur="6.989">before Trump was elected so do you think</text>
  <text start="273.49" dur="5.459">they kind of removed those individuals</text>
  <text start="276.669" dur="4.47">to make everything look a lot better</text>
  <text start="278.949" dur="4.411">during the election and then after Trump</text>
  <text start="281.139" dur="4.53">was elected they brought those numbers</text>
  <text start="283.36" dur="4.589">back and they said hey look I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="285.669" dur="5.581">how this happened that&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="287.949" dur="8.821">happened and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="291.25" dur="8.55">is that we are at levels from 1973 in</text>
  <text start="296.77" dur="5.579">regards to initial jobless claims now</text>
  <text start="299.8" dur="4.76">when we look at this we do have to</text>
  <text start="302.349" dur="6.181">remember something very important</text>
  <text start="304.56" dur="7.9">every time initial jobless claims hit a</text>
  <text start="308.53" dur="7.199">very low point we were in a recession we</text>
  <text start="312.46" dur="5.91">saw this back in 2008</text>
  <text start="315.729" dur="6.511">where we the initial jobless claims was</text>
  <text start="318.37" dur="8.549">very low we saw this back during 2000</text>
  <text start="322.24" dur="7.109">2001 and going back throughout time we</text>
  <text start="326.919" dur="4.59">saw it every single time now we are at</text>
  <text start="329.349" dur="6.21">the lowest point that we&amp;#39;ve ever been</text>
  <text start="331.509" dur="7.921">since 1973 which tells us that we are</text>
  <text start="335.559" dur="7.681">ready for a major recession slash</text>
  <text start="339.43" dur="5.069">collapse of the entire system actually I</text>
  <text start="343.24" dur="2.819">think we&amp;#39;re in a recession right now</text>
  <text start="344.499" dur="5.13">John Williams thinks were in a recession</text>
  <text start="346.059" dur="5.371">right now and most likely most likely we</text>
  <text start="349.629" dur="3.09">are and you have to remember the</text>
  <text start="351.43" dur="3.959">government doesn&amp;#39;t report a recession</text>
  <text start="352.719" dur="4.141">until many months afterwards and they</text>
  <text start="355.389" dur="4.71">always go back in time they said oh yes</text>
  <text start="356.86" dur="5.16">it started at this point and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="360.099" dur="3.5">seeing that retail is a complete and</text>
  <text start="362.02" dur="5.31">utter disaster</text>
  <text start="363.599" dur="6.671">BCBG well they&amp;#39;re planning to close</text>
  <text start="367.33" dur="5.519">stores and lay off people all we are</text>
  <text start="370.27" dur="3.959">hearing right now after the holiday</text>
  <text start="372.849" dur="4.62">season they remember the holiday season</text>
  <text start="374.229" dur="5.67">is when stores take all of those profits</text>
  <text start="377.469" dur="4.47">and it allows them to make it through</text>
  <text start="379.899" dur="4.14">the rest of the year and hopefully the</text>
  <text start="381.939" dur="5.4">holiday season was really good where</text>
  <text start="384.039" dur="6.63">they can expand well this holiday season</text>
  <text start="387.339" dur="5.91">is so bad that stores are laying off and</text>
  <text start="390.669" dur="4.98">closing left and right I mean it just</text>
  <text start="393.249" dur="3.991">doesn&amp;#39;t stop but of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="395.649" dur="3.45">making excuses of why all this is</text>
  <text start="397.24" dur="4.349">happening everything&amp;#39;s going online no</text>
  <text start="399.099" dur="4.171">we already discussed this we combined</text>
  <text start="401.589" dur="6.931">the brick-and-mortar and the online</text>
  <text start="403.27" dur="6.929">business it hasn&amp;#39;t gone anywhere today</text>
  <text start="408.52" dur="3">the corporate media is out there and the</text>
  <text start="410.199" dur="2.851">government numbers are out there and</text>
  <text start="411.52" dur="4.679">they&amp;#39;re trying to tell us that housing</text>
  <text start="413.05" dur="5.639">starts well they are way up they beat</text>
  <text start="416.199" dur="4.11">expectations single family permits</text>
  <text start="418.689" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re rising to the highest level of</text>
  <text start="420.309" dur="3.811">2007 well we know what happened in 2008</text>
  <text start="423.039" dur="3.72">with real estate everything came</text>
  <text start="424.12" dur="6.21">crashing down and when you look at</text>
  <text start="426.759" dur="6.111">housing you can see that housing starts</text>
  <text start="430.33" dur="6.03">hermits it&amp;#39;s completely meaningless</text>
  <text start="432.87" dur="6.939">because most of them aren&amp;#39;t completed</text>
  <text start="436.36" dur="5.669">and permits mean absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="439.809" dur="5.311">until the house is built and someone</text>
  <text start="442.029" dur="5.06">actually purchased it so all of this</text>
  <text start="445.12" dur="4.329">that they&amp;#39;re saying right now is</text>
  <text start="447.089" dur="4.01">completely meaningless it just</text>
  <text start="449.449" dur="4.11">like saying the subprime security</text>
  <text start="451.099" dur="4.171">they&amp;#39;re all triple-a and everyone should</text>
  <text start="453.559" dur="3.031">just believe that and that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="455.27" dur="3.539">government is saying that&amp;#39;s what all the</text>
  <text start="456.59" dur="4.4">reporting agencies are saying but we</text>
  <text start="458.809" dur="4.35">turns out they&amp;#39;re completely garbage and</text>
  <text start="460.99" dur="5.289">we can see what the government is still</text>
  <text start="463.159" dur="6.9">doing they&amp;#39;re still putting out the</text>
  <text start="466.279" dur="5.85">illusion that everything is going</text>
  <text start="470.059" dur="4.2">perfectly well with the economy and they</text>
  <text start="472.129" dur="4.921">want this they want everyone to believe</text>
  <text start="474.259" dur="6.78">that everything is fine now something</text>
  <text start="477.05" dur="6.959">very interesting we talked about student</text>
  <text start="481.039" dur="5.16">loans how these students coming out of</text>
  <text start="484.009" dur="6.78">college they spent a lot of time in</text>
  <text start="486.199" dur="6.09">college they have a lot of debt they</text>
  <text start="490.789" dur="3.87">can&amp;#39;t pay it back because they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="492.289" dur="6.99">find jobs and the government came in and</text>
  <text start="494.659" dur="6.48">what did they do well they took their</text>
  <text start="499.279" dur="4.47">loans and they base it off their income</text>
  <text start="501.139" dur="5.911">and divided over many many years like 30</text>
  <text start="503.749" dur="6.301">25 whatever it is when we find out from</text>
  <text start="507.05" dur="6.27">the Wall Street Journal that many more</text>
  <text start="510.05" dur="5.549">students have defaulted on or failed to</text>
  <text start="513.32" dur="4.79">pay back their college loans than the US</text>
  <text start="515.599" dur="5.79">government previously believed</text>
  <text start="518.11" dur="5.169">well the omission came last Friday the</text>
  <text start="521.389" dur="4.591">Education Department released a memo</text>
  <text start="523.279" dur="4.86">saying that had overstated student loan</text>
  <text start="525.98" dur="5.64">repayment rates at most colleges and</text>
  <text start="528.139" dur="7.56">trade schools and the numbers are not</text>
  <text start="531.62" dur="6.899">correct which means that the problem is</text>
  <text start="535.699" dur="5.311">much worse than we originally thought</text>
  <text start="538.519" dur="5.221">and of course they&amp;#39;re saying this is a</text>
  <text start="541.01" dur="5.519">technical programming error and this has</text>
  <text start="543.74" dur="6.99">been going on for many years yes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="546.529" dur="7.591">the famous glitch excuse so how bad was</text>
  <text start="550.73" dur="5.909">the data fabrication well when the new</text>
  <text start="554.12" dur="3.839">numbers were analyzed the data revealed</text>
  <text start="556.639" dur="4.111">that the department previously had</text>
  <text start="557.959" dur="5.281">inflated the repayment rates of 99.8% of</text>
  <text start="560.75" dur="4.529">all colleges and trade schools in the</text>
  <text start="563.24" dur="3.839">country in other words virtually every</text>
  <text start="565.279" dur="5.071">single number was made to appear better</text>
  <text start="567.079" dur="7.411">than it actually was and right now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="570.35" dur="6.06">a complete disaster more than a thousand</text>
  <text start="574.49" dur="4.409">colleges and trade schools or about a</text>
  <text start="576.41" dur="5.369">quarter of the total at least half the</text>
  <text start="578.899" dur="3.941">students had defaulted or failed to pay</text>
  <text start="581.779" dur="3.791">down at least</text>
  <text start="582.84" dur="6.72">one dollar on their debt within seven</text>
  <text start="585.57" dur="6.57">years this is unbelievable so the</text>
  <text start="589.56" dur="6.05">student loan crisis is much much worse</text>
  <text start="592.14" dur="5.67">than we originally thought which means</text>
  <text start="595.61" dur="4.81">how was the unemployment number down to</text>
  <text start="597.81" dur="6.36">four point seven percent think about</text>
  <text start="600.42" dur="6.419">what&amp;#39;s happening right now everything is</text>
  <text start="604.17" dur="4.23">falling apart truth bombs are coming out</text>
  <text start="606.839" dur="2.851">left and right and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="608.4" dur="3.09">gonna blame everything oh it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="609.69" dur="4.26">weather it was a technical glitch for</text>
  <text start="611.49" dur="5.28">over eight years and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="613.95" dur="6.98">continually do this because the truth</text>
  <text start="616.77" dur="8.31">will be coming out this economy is fake</text>
  <text start="620.93" dur="6.79">we see right now that China well they</text>
  <text start="625.08" dur="5.97">have accelerated in dumping US</text>
  <text start="627.72" dur="5.79">Treasuries now securities plunged by a</text>

  <text start="636.72" dur="7.02">plunged 41 billion in October of 2016</text>
  <text start="639.33" dur="7.16">and now we see that Treasuries are being</text>
  <text start="643.74" dur="5.28">dumped left and right</text>
  <text start="646.49" dur="4.99">China&amp;#39;s Holdings now the second largest</text>
  <text start="649.02" dur="5.94">behind Japan are down to one point zero</text>
  <text start="651.48" dur="5.7">four nine trillion at this pace it won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="654.96" dur="5.46">take long before China&amp;#39;s pile of</text>

  <text start="666.72" dur="6.99">China slashed its holdings by 215</text>

  <text start="684.51" dur="4.29">doing the same thing how do we know this</text>
  <text start="686.07" dur="5.19">because if we look at the international</text>
