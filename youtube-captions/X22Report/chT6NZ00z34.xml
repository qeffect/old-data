  <text start="65.869" dur="3.301">old wag the dog distraction being used</text>
  <text start="68.21" dur="4.049">on the Cabal</text>
  <text start="69.17" dur="5.12">but why let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="72.259" dur="4.561">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="74.29" dur="5.17">now we&amp;#39;ve been seeing a lot of stories</text>
  <text start="76.82" dur="6.15">with Trump and Trump jr. and Steve</text>
  <text start="79.46" dur="5.75">Bannon and it&amp;#39;s starting to look like</text>
  <text start="82.97" dur="5.069">that this is the old wag the dog</text>
  <text start="85.21" dur="5.38">distraction type of trick where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="88.039" dur="5.521">trying to keep the corporate media busy</text>
  <text start="90.59" dur="5.37">with absolutely nothing and it looks</text>
  <text start="93.56" dur="4.11">like Bannon and Trump it looks like</text>
  <text start="95.96" dur="4.049">they&amp;#39;re all part of this and I think</text>
  <text start="97.67" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re gonna continue this on until the</text>
  <text start="100.009" dur="4.021">very very end where they can keep the</text>
  <text start="102.14" dur="3.99">corporate media completely distracted</text>
  <text start="104.03" dur="3.509">the Cabal completely distracted from</text>
  <text start="106.13" dur="3.12">what is really going on and if you</text>
  <text start="107.539" dur="3.75">notice the corporate media they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="109.25" dur="3.869">really picking up on a lot of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="111.289" dur="4.741">going on around the world now of course</text>
  <text start="113.119" dur="4.381">in the past they only received the</text>
  <text start="116.03" dur="2.519">stories that they were supposed to</text>
  <text start="117.5" dur="3.27">report on from the intelligence</text>
  <text start="118.549" dur="3.871">community and most of the time that did</text>
  <text start="120.77" dur="3.209">not include anything that was really</text>
  <text start="122.42" dur="3.42">going on around the world of course if</text>
  <text start="123.979" dur="3.96">there was something that they needed a</text>
  <text start="125.84" dur="4.32">report on they put their spin on it to</text>
  <text start="127.939" dur="3.541">make it look like it&amp;#39;s really happening</text>
  <text start="130.16" dur="3.329">in the best interest of the United</text>
  <text start="131.48" dur="4.229">States and the people of the United</text>
  <text start="133.489" dur="4.411">States and the world but what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="135.709" dur="4.651">seeing right now is that things are</text>
  <text start="137.9" dur="4.2">rapidly breaking down and there are</text>
  <text start="140.36" dur="5.06">secret talks or secret things going on</text>
  <text start="142.1" dur="5.97">behind the scenes where the Cabal is</text>
  <text start="145.42" dur="4.87">completely trapped and is now in a</text>
  <text start="148.07" dur="4.65">corner now what&amp;#39;s very interesting way</text>
  <text start="150.29" dur="4.86">back we talked about the Bundys in there</text>
  <text start="152.72" dur="4.5">Bundy ranch and they were arrested and</text>
  <text start="155.15" dur="3.54">again they were trying to capture their</text>
  <text start="157.22" dur="2.79">land they didn&amp;#39;t want to give it up</text>
  <text start="158.69" dur="3.69">there were protests and stuff and there</text>
  <text start="160.01" dur="5.28">were snipers well it looks like the</text>
  <text start="162.38" dur="5.52">government well they screwed up they</text>
  <text start="165.29" dur="5.52">withhold a lot of information the judge</text>
  <text start="167.9" dur="5.55">declared a mistrial and we see right now</text>
  <text start="170.81" dur="5.88">that there&amp;#39;s a huge amount of corruption</text>
  <text start="173.45" dur="5.58">there wirless lies and there was a lot</text>
  <text start="176.69" dur="6.949">going on within this case which we knew</text>
  <text start="179.03" dur="7.59">from the beginning now the u.s. judge</text>
  <text start="183.639" dur="5.41">dismissed the criminal case against</text>
  <text start="186.62" dur="5.16">ivan Bundy and three other men on</text>
  <text start="189.049" dur="4.321">charges stemming from an armed 2014</text>
  <text start="191.78" dur="4.379">standoff with federal law enforcement</text>
  <text start="193.37" dur="6">officers over a cattle grazing rights</text>
  <text start="196.159" dur="5.821">dispute now remember they wanted their</text>
  <text start="199.37" dur="6.39">land and I think this was attached to</text>
  <text start="201.98" dur="7.08">other senators that wanted the land for</text>
  <text start="205.76" dur="5.699">development or some mineral deposits and</text>
  <text start="209.06" dur="5.429">things like that but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="211.459" dur="5.791">is the judge cited five key pieces of</text>
  <text start="214.489" dur="4.89">information that the prosecutors did not</text>
  <text start="217.25" dur="5.31">disclose records about surveillance and</text>
  <text start="219.379" dur="5.67">snipers at the Bundy ranch unredacted</text>
  <text start="222.56" dur="4.53">FBI logs about activity at the ranch in</text>
  <text start="225.049" dur="4.201">the days around the standoff threat</text>
  <text start="227.09" dur="5.039">assessments about the Bundy&amp;#39;s dating to</text>
  <text start="229.25" dur="7.14">2012 and internal affairs reports about</text>
  <text start="232.129" dur="6.42">the BLM now Navarro methodically laid</text>
  <text start="236.39" dur="4.11">out her reasoning for about an hour</text>
  <text start="238.549" dur="4.201">citing legal standards and case law</text>
  <text start="240.5" dur="4.43">before delivering her ruling</text>
  <text start="242.75" dur="4.709">she said the evidence that was withheld</text>
  <text start="244.93" dur="4.21">could have been favorable to the accused</text>
  <text start="247.459" dur="4.56">and could have affected the outcome of</text>
  <text start="249.14" dur="4.23">the case of course it could have Navarro</text>
  <text start="252.019" dur="4.141">stopped short of dismissing charges</text>
  <text start="253.37" dur="4.2">against the four men it is unclear</text>
  <text start="256.16" dur="3.27">whether the case will be retired because</text>
  <text start="257.57" dur="4.02">the Navarro did not rule whether the</text>
  <text start="259.43" dur="4.98">mistrial was with or without prejudice</text>
  <text start="261.59" dur="5.07">now the judge is considering dismissing</text>
  <text start="264.41" dur="4.74">the case with prejudice and blocking</text>
  <text start="266.66" dur="3.479">prosecutors from retrying the case and</text>
  <text start="269.15" dur="3.15">it looks like she&amp;#39;s going to be coming</text>
  <text start="270.139" dur="5.671">up with a decision very very soon maybe</text>
  <text start="272.3" dur="6.72">even today now very interestingly out in</text>
  <text start="275.81" dur="7.53">North Korea we understand that moon</text>
  <text start="279.02" dur="6.98">jae-in approached North Korea and said</text>
  <text start="283.34" dur="6.389">listen we would like to have talks and</text>
  <text start="286" dur="5.83">they set up their hotline and we see</text>
  <text start="289.729" dur="5.671">that kim jeong-hoon who&amp;#39;s comfortable</text>
  <text start="291.83" dur="5.28">now with his missile program with his</text>
  <text start="295.4" dur="4.47">nuclear program decided to have talks</text>
  <text start="297.11" dur="4.98">with moon jae-in the thing that people</text>
  <text start="299.87" dur="6.51">don&amp;#39;t understand is that there was a</text>
  <text start="302.09" dur="7.98">moon putin plan and this was a path to</text>
  <text start="306.38" dur="7.259">peace and of course no one really talked</text>
  <text start="310.07" dur="5.13">about it we talked about this about</text>
  <text start="313.639" dur="4.981">these secret talks that were going on</text>
  <text start="315.2" dur="4.56">and this was the plan the moon putin</text>
  <text start="318.62" dur="6.42">planned it</text>
  <text start="319.76" dur="8.55">it&amp;#39;s unveiled now now what they did was</text>
  <text start="325.04" dur="5.61">they were trying to save face with the</text>
  <text start="328.31" dur="6.63">United States they try to make it look</text>
  <text start="330.65" dur="6">like South Korea approached North Korea</text>
  <text start="334.94" dur="4.11">which they did this way North Korea</text>
  <text start="336.65" dur="5.76">didn&amp;#39;t make the first move neither did</text>
  <text start="339.05" dur="6.39">the United States and moon jae-in said</text>
  <text start="342.41" dur="6.6">yes we will approach them now what was</text>
  <text start="345.44" dur="8.91">the reasoning behind this because the</text>
  <text start="349.01" dur="8.7">plan the entire thing around this was to</text>
  <text start="354.35" dur="6.9">allow North Korea to join the one belt</text>
  <text start="357.71" dur="5.97">one road system and president moon</text>
  <text start="361.25" dur="4.71">outlined it as a nine bridges of</text>
  <text start="363.68" dur="5.73">cooperation linking South Korea to</text>
  <text start="365.96" dur="6.21">Russia via North Korea gas railroads</text>
  <text start="369.41" dur="3.87">ports electricity a northern sea route</text>
  <text start="372.17" dur="3.69">shipbuilding jobs</text>
  <text start="373.28" dur="5.46">agriculture fisheries something they</text>
  <text start="375.86" dur="5.13">need Siberian oil and gas pipelines</text>
  <text start="378.74" dur="5.82">would be extended to Korea but North and</text>
  <text start="380.99" dur="6.87">South as well as Japan would have to all</text>
  <text start="384.56" dur="5.52">agree on this both Koreas would be</text>
  <text start="387.86" dur="3.68">linked up with the vast rail networks of</text>
  <text start="390.08" dur="4.23">Beijing belt and Road initiative</text>
  <text start="391.54" dur="4.51">including high-speed rail and the</text>
  <text start="394.31" dur="3.24">Eurasian Economic Union which includes</text>
  <text start="396.05" dur="3.66">the trans-siberian railway</text>
  <text start="397.55" dur="4.23">in other words North Korea would accept</text>
  <text start="399.71" dur="5.85">the security guarantees of the other</text>
  <text start="401.78" dur="7.2">countries if they did one thing if they</text>
  <text start="405.56" dur="6.06">halted their missile testing and froze</text>
  <text start="408.98" dur="4.02">their nuclear program but North Korea</text>
  <text start="411.62" dur="2.99">said they didn&amp;#39;t want to do this because</text>
  <text start="413" dur="4.83">they were afraid of the United States</text>
  <text start="414.61" dur="5.11">invading having regime change so they</text>
  <text start="417.83" dur="5.79">allowed North Korea to reach a certain</text>
  <text start="419.72" dur="6.06">point Kim jong-un decided okay I have</text>
  <text start="423.62" dur="7.08">reached that point and now we can have a</text>
  <text start="425.78" dur="7.86">discussion so moon jae-in reached out to</text>
  <text start="430.7" dur="7.11">North Korea North Korea said okay let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="433.64" dur="6.21">speak moon jae-in said okay during the</text>
  <text start="437.81" dur="4.65">winter olympics where north korea is</text>
  <text start="439.85" dur="4.41">invited and where they might join we</text>
  <text start="442.46" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t want to have military drills in</text>
  <text start="444.26" dur="4.44">the beginning the Cabal said no were</text>
  <text start="446.48" dur="3.48">having military drills then trump came</text>
  <text start="448.7" dur="4.32">out and said okay we will not have</text>
  <text start="449.96" dur="4.95">drills during this period of time</text>
  <text start="453.02" dur="4.29">what just happened here remember the</text>
  <text start="454.91" dur="5.069">plan the United States how to stop</text>
  <text start="457.31" dur="7.759">drills this is exactly what they just</text>
  <text start="459.979" dur="9.481">did Kim Jang Kim jong-eun is no longer</text>
  <text start="465.069" dur="8.56">pushing the nuclear tests pushing the</text>
  <text start="469.46" dur="9.53">missile tests he&amp;#39;s satisfied where he is</text>
  <text start="473.629" dur="8.551">and now Russia stepped in with China and</text>
  <text start="478.99" dur="6.7">invited the United States to join the</text>
  <text start="482.18" dur="7.859">peace talks so it looks like the u.s.</text>
  <text start="485.69" dur="6.539">was invited in saying North Korea wants</text>
  <text start="490.039" dur="5.011">to speak now remember going back in time</text>
  <text start="492.229" dur="5.791">Tillerson well he extended an olive</text>
  <text start="495.05" dur="6.239">branch where or he laid some breadcrumbs</text>
  <text start="498.02" dur="5.73">saying this is what we should do wanted</text>
  <text start="501.289" dur="4.53">to get feelers on what was going on the</text>
  <text start="503.75" dur="5.37">whole plan is starting to take shape</text>
  <text start="505.819" dur="5.31">right now now we have this other issue</text>
  <text start="509.12" dur="3.75">with Pakistan where the Trump</text>
  <text start="511.129" dur="4.621">administration has announced that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="512.87" dur="5.43">cut he&amp;#39;s cutting aid to Pakistan now</text>
  <text start="515.75" dur="5.76">remember Pakistan borders near</text>
  <text start="518.3" dur="5.609">Afghanistan Trump has sent in more</text>
  <text start="521.51" dur="4.079">troops into Afghanistan now a lot of</text>
  <text start="523.909" dur="3.451">people said see we&amp;#39;re not getting out of</text>
  <text start="525.589" dur="2.731">war in Afghanistan more troops are going</text>
  <text start="527.36" dur="2.82">there and of course the corporate media</text>
  <text start="528.32" dur="5.36">played this up thinking that this was</text>
  <text start="530.18" dur="5.81">the same policy that Obama was following</text>
  <text start="533.68" dur="5.95">no this is not what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="535.99" dur="7.27">remember the bushes made deals with</text>
  <text start="539.63" dur="6.24">Pakistan gave aid to Pakistan to get</text>
  <text start="543.26" dur="4.53">into Afghanistan there are routes that</text>
  <text start="545.87" dur="3.15">lead into Afghanistan this is what the</text>
  <text start="547.79" dur="3.81">Islamic state and other terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="549.02" dur="5.009">have been using the US military has also</text>
  <text start="551.6" dur="4.26">been using these routes Pakistan because</text>
  <text start="554.029" dur="3.691">the aid was cut they&amp;#39;re shutting down</text>
  <text start="555.86" dur="4.74">these routes they&amp;#39;re actually shutting</text>
  <text start="557.72" dur="7.17">down their routes to the terrorist</text>
  <text start="560.6" dur="6.69">groups and you have to remember Pakistan</text>
  <text start="564.89" dur="4.819">backed the Taliban the Taliban is not</text>
  <text start="567.29" dur="4.95">terrorists these are people of</text>
  <text start="569.709" dur="4.841">Afghanistan who want their country back</text>
  <text start="572.24" dur="4.469">the United States came in and set up a</text>
  <text start="574.55" dur="4.86">puppet government and every time people</text>
  <text start="576.709" dur="4.5">who want their country back and who are</text>
  <text start="579.41" dur="3.419">willing to fight for their country they</text>
  <text start="581.209" dur="5.901">automatically call them terrorists an</text>
  <text start="582.829" dur="7.411">example in Libya Lebanon Syria</text>
  <text start="587.11" dur="6.01">anyone that well forget Syria right now</text>
  <text start="590.24" dur="5.28">Libya Lebanon Iraq once they have the</text>
  <text start="593.12" dur="4.26">puppet government set up anyone who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="595.52" dur="3.75">against that puppet government is then</text>
  <text start="597.38" dur="6.12">called a terrace they used the word</text>
  <text start="599.27" dur="6.54">al-qaeda because under the US government</text>
  <text start="603.5" dur="3.96">they had the right to use drones to</text>
  <text start="605.81" dur="3.93">strike al-qaeda and that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="607.46" dur="4.02">called them al-qaeda but they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="609.74" dur="5.16">there the everyday people of the country</text>
  <text start="611.48" dur="4.17">in Ukraine once the puppet regime was</text>
  <text start="614.9" dur="2.76">put into place</text>
  <text start="615.65" dur="5.1">everyone in the southeast part of</text>
  <text start="617.66" dur="5.46">Ukraine in the Donbass area they were</text>
  <text start="620.75" dur="5.19">considered terrorists because they</text>
  <text start="623.12" dur="6.87">weren&amp;#39;t going along with the new puppet</text>
  <text start="625.94" dur="5.52">government and right now this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="629.99" dur="5.43">happening because they&amp;#39;re cutting off</text>
  <text start="631.46" dur="6.15">everything in Afghanistan the Islamic</text>
  <text start="635.42" dur="5.13">state they&amp;#39;ll have no supplies getting</text>
  <text start="637.61" dur="5.19">to them the troops that have been sent</text>
  <text start="640.55" dur="4.02">in there are going after the poppy</text>
  <text start="642.8" dur="3.9">fields shutting down the intelligence</text>
  <text start="644.57" dur="3.96">agencies poppy fields they&amp;#39;re shutting</text>
  <text start="646.7" dur="3.24">all that down and I think eventually</text>
  <text start="648.53" dur="2.94">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is that puppet</text>
  <text start="649.94" dur="4.5">government I think it&amp;#39;s going to fall</text>
  <text start="651.47" dur="4.59">because right now they only handle the</text>
  <text start="654.44" dur="4.68">capital and the rest of the country is</text>
  <text start="656.06" dur="4.68">really the Taliban and there are some</text>
  <text start="659.12" dur="3.72">pockets of the Islamic state out there</text>
  <text start="660.74" dur="3.3">and other terrorist groups and I think</text>
  <text start="662.84" dur="3.12">what&amp;#39;s going to happen here is that</text>
  <text start="664.04" dur="3.3">puppet regime it&amp;#39;s going to fall</text>
  <text start="665.96" dur="4.2">remember John Kerry was out there</text>
  <text start="667.34" dur="4.68">helping the elections out trying to get</text>
  <text start="670.16" dur="3.54">the new leader in there so they can find</text>
  <text start="672.02" dur="4.02">so they can sign the bilateral security</text>
  <text start="673.7" dur="4.46">agreement so we can keep troops in</text>
  <text start="676.04" dur="4.38">Afghanistan the only reason Obama was</text>
  <text start="678.16" dur="4.45">removing the troops from Afghanistan is</text>
  <text start="680.42" dur="3.69">because President Karzai who was in</text>
  <text start="682.61" dur="3.81">power at the time wouldn&amp;#39;t sign the</text>
  <text start="684.11" dur="4.44">bilateral security agreement so the US</text>
  <text start="686.42" dur="4.98">troops had no choice but to leave</text>
  <text start="688.55" dur="4.14">Afghanistan but when the new leader was</text>
  <text start="691.4" dur="3.63">put into place with the help of John</text>
  <text start="692.69" dur="3.9">Kerry he automatically signed that</text>
  <text start="695.03" dur="4.11">agreement and the troops were able to</text>
  <text start="696.59" dur="6.57">stay in Afghanistan so we can see right</text>
  <text start="699.14" dur="6.66">now the agenda is to get out of</text>
  <text start="703.16" dur="5.82">Afghanistan to shut down the Cabal</text>
  <text start="705.8" dur="7.02">actually it&amp;#39;s trapping the Cabal inside</text>
  <text start="708.98" dur="6.12">of Afghanistan locking them out just</text>
  <text start="712.82" dur="5.16">like it was done in Syria just like it</text>
  <text start="715.1" dur="4.74">was done in Iraq and right now we see</text>
  <text start="717.98" dur="4.98">this plan</text>
  <text start="719.84" dur="6.09">that the Cabal had keeping Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="722.96" dur="6.29">is now falling apart think about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="725.93" dur="5.81">happening right now their plan to push</text>
  <text start="729.25" dur="6.55">unrest in Iran and have regime change</text>
  <text start="731.74" dur="5.1">done because the United States went to</text>
  <text start="735.8" dur="4.8">the UNSC</text>
  <text start="736.84" dur="7.12">presented their case and guess what no</text>
  <text start="740.6" dur="6.57">one decided to even take a look at it it</text>
  <text start="743.96" dur="6.15">was rejected the world said no we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="747.17" dur="5.1">getting involved in another country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="750.11" dur="5.28">internal problems because this would</text>
  <text start="752.27" dur="4.38">open a can of worms where all the other</text>
  <text start="755.39" dur="2.58">Middle Eastern countries would say well</text>
  <text start="756.65" dur="6.09">if they do that to Iran they can do it</text>
  <text start="757.97" dur="6.54">to every country and right now what the</text>
  <text start="762.74" dur="5.1">u.s. wanted what the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="764.51" dur="5.1">wanted Saudi Israel what they wanted was</text>
  <text start="767.84" dur="4.83">to go into Iran they wanted to get</text>
  <text start="769.61" dur="6.69">involved but guess what it didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="772.67" dur="7.83">the cabal&amp;#39;s plan is falling apart right</text>
  <text start="776.3" dur="7.04">now and right now as trump continually</text>
  <text start="780.5" dur="5.84">does this he&amp;#39;s using these wag the dog</text>
  <text start="783.34" dur="6.1">distractions on the corporate media on</text>
  <text start="786.34" dur="5.89">the cabal to keep them busy with</text>
  <text start="789.44" dur="5.82">absolute with complete nonsense</text>
  <text start="792.23" dur="4.88">which is meaningless in what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="795.26" dur="4.53">going on in the rest of the world and</text>
  <text start="797.11" dur="6.58">right now we can see they are losing</text>
  <text start="799.79" dur="6.96">their power everywhere what this means</text>
  <text start="803.69" dur="4.53">is they&amp;#39;re going to be desperate and I</text>
  <text start="806.75" dur="3.18">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised at all with all</text>
  <text start="808.22" dur="3.81">these events can&amp;#39;t put a date on it but</text>
  <text start="809.93" dur="4.92">with all these events there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="812.03" dur="5.06">be some type of false flag where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="814.85" dur="3.96">going to create something someplace and</text>
  <text start="817.09" dur="3.61">it&amp;#39;s going to be big</text>
  <text start="818.81" dur="4.53">where they&amp;#39;re gonna try to get us into</text>
  <text start="820.7" dur="5.67">war or they&amp;#39;re gonna try to do something</text>
  <text start="823.34" dur="4.35">to push their agenda and this is what</text>
  <text start="826.37" dur="2.73">we&amp;#39;re looking at we don&amp;#39;t know exactly</text>
  <text start="827.69" dur="3.84">when it could be during the Olympics in</text>
  <text start="829.1" dur="6.06">North Korea South Korea it could be out</text>
  <text start="831.53" dur="5.82">in Ukraine it could be near I ran it</text>
  <text start="835.16" dur="4.17">could be in Pakistan Afghanistan it</text>
  <text start="837.35" dur="3.87">could be in the United States we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="839.33" dur="3.54">know but it&amp;#39;s going to be big whatever</text>
  <text start="841.22" dur="3.12">they do it&amp;#39;s not going to be some type</text>
  <text start="842.87" dur="3.69">of regime change they might try that</text>
  <text start="844.34" dur="4.2">once again they might try something else</text>
  <text start="846.56" dur="3.57">that&amp;#39;s small but they&amp;#39;re eventually</text>
  <text start="848.54" dur="4.43">going to do something that&amp;#39;s much much</text>
  <text start="850.13" dur="4.46">larger and this is what we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="852.97" dur="3.57">right now because we can see that</text>
  <text start="854.59" dur="3.69">everything is lining up right now their</text>
  <text start="856.54" dur="3.98">backs are against the wall their power</text>
  <text start="858.28" dur="5.33">is being stripped away from them and</text>
  <text start="860.52" dur="7.51">they have nothing left at this point</text>
  <text start="863.61" dur="7.54">because as these investigations go forth</text>
  <text start="868.03" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;re gonna find out that there&amp;#39;s pedo</text>

  <text start="878.17" dur="5.91">find out where all this money has gone</text>
  <text start="881.26" dur="5.58">and once they start following the money</text>
  <text start="884.08" dur="4.95">trails like into the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="886.84" dur="4.89">the McCain Institute they start</text>

  <text start="894.88" dur="5.25">government things are going to rapidly</text>
  <text start="897.82" dur="3.93">fall apart for them and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
