  <text start="53.72" dur="6.63">episode 1195 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="57.14" dur="5.61">February 3rd 2017 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="60.35" dur="4.77">episode is Utah getting ready to dump</text>
  <text start="62.75" dur="6.21">the Fed dollar and make gold and silver</text>
  <text start="65.12" dur="6.6">legal tender let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="68.96" dur="5.31">collapse financial news now today we see</text>
  <text start="71.72" dur="4.89">the job numbers came out and we see the</text>
  <text start="74.27" dur="3.78">corporate media and Trump first of all</text>
  <text start="76.61" dur="3.75">the corporate media is out there saying</text>
  <text start="78.05" dur="5.19">that you know these aren&amp;#39;t really Trump</text>
  <text start="80.36" dur="4.98">numbers these are left over from Obama</text>
  <text start="83.24" dur="5.64">Trump is saying these are his numbers</text>
  <text start="85.34" dur="6.75">and look how great they are and when you</text>
  <text start="88.88" dur="6.63">really look at the data there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="92.09" dur="5.85">great here I mean both the president the</text>
  <text start="95.51" dur="5.25">corporate media and Obama they can slug</text>
  <text start="97.94" dur="4.8">it out and say yes these are my numbers</text>
  <text start="100.76" dur="5.1">but when we really look at the data and</text>
  <text start="102.74" dur="5.519">we cut through all the junk that they</text>
  <text start="105.86" dur="7.14">give us we can see that unemployment</text>
  <text start="108.259" dur="8.311">right now is not that great and we knew</text>
  <text start="113" dur="6.09">this from years and years ago where it</text>
  <text start="116.57" dur="4.68">is completely manipulated now the BLS</text>
  <text start="119.09" dur="3.57">came out and they said that there were</text>
  <text start="121.25" dur="3.93">two hundred and twenty seven thousand</text>
  <text start="122.66" dur="7.38">jobs that were added in January far</text>
  <text start="125.18" dur="9.54">above 175 175 thousand expected and in</text>
  <text start="130.04" dur="9.39">line with the ADP numbers now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="134.72" dur="7.92">seeing here is that these full-time jobs</text>
  <text start="139.43" dur="6.27">well they increased at the same time</text>
  <text start="142.64" dur="5.54">part-time jobs they tumbled so we had</text>
  <text start="145.7" dur="6.03">full-time jobs increased by four hundred</text>
  <text start="148.18" dur="7.36">57,000 part-time jobs tumbled to four</text>
  <text start="151.73" dur="5.94">hundred and ninety thousand and we can</text>
  <text start="155.54" dur="3">see right now when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="157.67" dur="2.94">say oh wow</text>
  <text start="158.54" dur="5.07">everyone&amp;#39;s hiring full-time it looks</text>
  <text start="160.61" dur="5.07">fantastic everything&amp;#39;s great but things</text>
  <text start="163.61" dur="5.81">again don&amp;#39;t make sense with the job</text>
  <text start="165.68" dur="10.619">numbers retail jobs well they rose by</text>
  <text start="169.42" dur="9.73">46,000 in January and 229,000 in 2016</text>
  <text start="176.299" dur="5.671">which is very odd because we&amp;#39;ve had a</text>
  <text start="179.15" dur="6.87">lot of stores declare bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="181.97" dur="7.32">a lot of stores closed stores a lot of</text>
  <text start="186.02" dur="5.88">individuals and retail got laid off and</text>
  <text start="189.29" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us that jobs</text>
  <text start="191.9" dur="6.18">were added they&amp;#39;re saying clothing and</text>
  <text start="194.66" dur="5.64">clothing accessory stores added 18,000</text>
  <text start="198.08" dur="5.07">jobs electronics and applying stores</text>
  <text start="200.3" dur="5.46">aided added 8,000 furniture and home</text>
  <text start="203.15" dur="4.11">furnishing stores added 6,000 and of</text>
  <text start="205.76" dur="4.41">course everything that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="207.26" dur="5.37">looking at this still doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="210.17" dur="6.06">it looks like they&amp;#39;re up to their old</text>
  <text start="212.63" dur="6.95">tricks Construction is down new home</text>
  <text start="216.23" dur="7.05">sales are down construction jobs rose by</text>
  <text start="219.58" dur="6.01">36,000 so when we look at this again</text>
  <text start="223.28" dur="6.03">something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense now when we</text>
  <text start="225.59" dur="6.33">look at the labor force we see that</text>
  <text start="229.31" dur="5.96">there was a plunge of about seven</text>
  <text start="231.92" dur="6.17">hundred and thirty six thousand people</text>
  <text start="235.27" dur="5.62">so when we look at this we see that</text>
  <text start="238.09" dur="5.5">seven hundred and thirty six thousand</text>
  <text start="240.89" dur="5.4">this is the biggest drop in the series</text>
  <text start="243.59" dur="3.929">throughout the history which brings the</text>
  <text start="246.29" dur="3.449">number of Americans not in the labor</text>
  <text start="247.519" dur="6.271">force to 94 million three hundred</text>
  <text start="249.739" dur="5.551">sixty-six thousand and when we look at</text>
  <text start="253.79" dur="4.8">this we see that the labor participation</text>
  <text start="255.29" dur="5.069">rate rose from sixty two point seven to</text>
  <text start="258.59" dur="4.8">sixty two point nine the highest print</text>
  <text start="260.359" dur="5.521">since September now all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="263.39" dur="3.75">everyone just found jobs now the economy</text>
  <text start="265.88" dur="3.53">didn&amp;#39;t change the debt level didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="267.14" dur="4.529">change GDP is worse than ever</text>
  <text start="269.41" dur="3.759">the only thing that has been going up is</text>
  <text start="271.669" dur="4.621">the stock market yes</text>
  <text start="273.169" dur="4.261">Trump has made these promises with other</text>
  <text start="276.29" dur="4.29">companies that they&amp;#39;re gonna be bringing</text>
  <text start="277.43" dur="6.48">comes back but nothing has been done as</text>
  <text start="280.58" dur="6.6">of yet so when we look at these job</text>
  <text start="283.91" dur="6.03">numbers what do we say well in the last</text>
  <text start="287.18" dur="6.239">three months employment has only risen</text>
  <text start="289.94" dur="6.72">by a grand total of 33,000 employment in</text>
  <text start="293.419" dur="4.861">January declined by 30,000 for the</text>
  <text start="296.66" dur="5.1">entire year employment rose by only a</text>
  <text start="298.28" dur="5.52">hunt 1.5 million the average increase</text>
  <text start="301.76" dur="4.77">from a year ago is only a hundred</text>
  <text start="303.8" dur="5.67">twenty-nine thousand per month and the</text>
  <text start="306.53" dur="4.38">media is going crazy over the beat the</text>
  <text start="309.47" dur="3.42">street headline of two hundred and</text>
  <text start="310.91" dur="2.689">twenty seven thousand jobs now last</text>
  <text start="312.89" dur="3.09">month</text>
  <text start="313.599" dur="6.061">the BLS revised</text>
  <text start="315.98" dur="7.23">November employment to 204,000 from 178</text>
  <text start="319.66" dur="7.42">this month the BLS revised November from</text>
  <text start="323.21" dur="7.32">204 to 164,000 in the past two months</text>
  <text start="327.08" dur="8.79">the BLS revised October lower each month</text>
  <text start="330.53" dur="10.32">from 161 to 142 to 135 the BLS revised</text>
  <text start="335.87" dur="8.34">October 8 third time to 124 this month</text>
  <text start="340.85" dur="8.07">the BLS revised September up from 208 to</text>
  <text start="344.21" dur="7.47">249 so if you start counting all the</text>
  <text start="348.92" dur="4.92">people who want a job but gave up all</text>
  <text start="351.68" dur="3.15">the people with part-time jobs that want</text>
  <text start="353.84" dur="2.64">a full-time job</text>
  <text start="354.83" dur="3.09">all the people who dropped off the</text>
  <text start="356.48" dur="4.35">unemployment rolls because their</text>
  <text start="357.92" dur="5.37">unemployment benefits ran out you get a</text>
  <text start="360.83" dur="5.34">closer picture of what the unemployment</text>
  <text start="363.29" dur="8.04">rate is the number is in the last row</text>
  <text start="366.17" dur="8.37">labeled u6 u6 is much higher at nine</text>
  <text start="371.33" dur="5.37">point four percent both members would be</text>
  <text start="374.54" dur="4.2">way higher still if it were not for</text>
  <text start="376.7" dur="5">millions of people dropping out of the</text>
  <text start="378.74" dur="6.03">labor force over the past few years</text>
  <text start="381.7" dur="8.23">which actually if you recalculate that</text>
  <text start="384.77" dur="8.64">that brings us up to like 23 percent so</text>
  <text start="389.93" dur="7.68">let&amp;#39;s put the job numbers into proper</text>
  <text start="393.41" dur="8.21">perspective in the household survey if</text>
  <text start="397.61" dur="7.59">you work as little as one hour a week</text>
  <text start="401.62" dur="5.77">guess what you&amp;#39;re employed so if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="405.2" dur="4.41">selling something on eBay or any other</text>
  <text start="407.39" dur="6.15">site and you sell one thing and you work</text>
  <text start="409.61" dur="7.77">one hour you&amp;#39;re employed if you work</text>
  <text start="413.54" dur="6.62">three part-time jobs 12 hours each you</text>
  <text start="417.38" dur="5.25">are a full-time employee</text>
  <text start="420.16" dur="4.87">if the payroll survey three part-time</text>
  <text start="422.63" dur="4.53">jobs count as three jobs the BLS</text>
  <text start="425.03" dur="4.38">attempts to factor this in but they do</text>
  <text start="427.16" dur="4.86">not weed out duplicate social security</text>
  <text start="429.41" dur="6.27">numbers so they&amp;#39;re double counting jobs</text>
  <text start="432.02" dur="6.06">in the payroll survey now we have the</text>
  <text start="435.68" dur="6.99">household survey verse the payroll</text>
  <text start="438.08" dur="7.29">survey the payroll survey is the</text>
  <text start="442.67" dur="4.71">headline jobs number generally released</text>
  <text start="445.37" dur="4.319">the first Friday of every month it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="447.38" dur="5.219">based on employer reap</text>
  <text start="449.689" dur="6.48">courting the households survey is a</text>
  <text start="452.599" dur="5.25">phone survey conducted by the BLS it</text>
  <text start="456.169" dur="4.74">measures unemployment and many other</text>
  <text start="457.849" dur="5.57">factors so when we look at this we can</text>
  <text start="460.909" dur="4.56">see how they can skew these numbers</text>
  <text start="463.419" dur="4.75">because if we take what we just talked</text>
  <text start="465.469" dur="5.07">about working one hour and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="468.169" dur="4.47">asking it on a survey you can see how</text>
  <text start="470.539" dur="3.21">the BLS can say oh okay look we have a</text>
  <text start="472.639" dur="3.36">higher number of people that are</text>
  <text start="473.749" dur="4.29">employed and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="475.999" dur="4.77">distortions in this so when we really</text>
  <text start="478.039" dur="6.96">look at all these job numbers we see</text>
  <text start="480.769" dur="6.781">that employment growth is around 129,000</text>
  <text start="484.999" dur="4.53">on average from a year ago seventy-nine</text>
  <text start="487.55" dur="3.659">thousand per month since March and only</text>
  <text start="489.529" dur="3.87">11,000 per month for the last three</text>
  <text start="491.209" dur="6">months what we&amp;#39;re looking at is that</text>
  <text start="493.399" dur="5.19">employment actually has stalled so they</text>
  <text start="497.209" dur="4.38">can be patting themselves on the back</text>
  <text start="498.589" dur="4.8">saying wow this is incredible it really</text>
  <text start="501.589" dur="5.28">isn&amp;#39;t and by the way the unemployment</text>
  <text start="503.389" dur="5.52">rate has gone up to 4.8% and like I said</text>
  <text start="506.869" dur="5.61">what&amp;#39;s going to happen over time here is</text>
  <text start="508.909" dur="5.79">all these numbers are gonna start rising</text>
  <text start="512.479" dur="5.67">because they need to start building the</text>
  <text start="514.699" dur="7.051">case that Trump and whatever he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="518.149" dur="6.891">right now is not working unless he takes</text>
  <text start="521.75" dur="5.67">control of the manipulation and</text>
  <text start="525.04" dur="4.239">manipulates these numbers lower because</text>
  <text start="527.42" dur="5.609">remember there is a fight going on right</text>
  <text start="529.279" dur="8.071">now of who is going to get the blame for</text>
  <text start="533.029" dur="6.06">the economy coming down now why all this</text>
  <text start="537.35" dur="3.63">is happening and all these job numbers</text>
  <text start="539.089" dur="4.711">are out there we see Deutsche Bank right</text>
  <text start="540.98" dur="7.649">now well they&amp;#39;re getting ready to cut as</text>
  <text start="543.8" dur="7.11">much as 17 percent of staff in their</text>
  <text start="548.629" dur="5.671">equities unit and the reduced fixed</text>
  <text start="550.91" dur="5.119">income headcount this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="554.3" dur="6.24">lot of people there&amp;#39;s gonna be about</text>
  <text start="556.029" dur="7.211">9,000 jobs across the company maybe even</text>
  <text start="560.54" dur="4.44">more there&amp;#39;s a lot of people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="563.24" dur="3.87">gonna be let go and you know once they</text>
  <text start="564.98" dur="6.329">give this number you know it always goes</text>
  <text start="567.11" dur="6.899">higher we see that US factory orders in</text>
  <text start="571.309" dur="5.33">December while there are almost exactly</text>
  <text start="574.009" dur="6.45">the same as they were in March 2006</text>
  <text start="576.639" dur="6.911">unchanged in 11 years and when we look</text>
  <text start="580.459" dur="6">at the trend the 24 month trend</text>
  <text start="583.55" dur="6.24">it is very clear and historically</text>
  <text start="586.459" dur="8.82">implied that one thing is true about all</text>
  <text start="589.79" dur="7.52">of this we are in a recession and we can</text>
  <text start="595.279" dur="5.191">see right now that there are many</text>
  <text start="597.31" dur="5.43">economic indicators that have been</text>
  <text start="600.47" dur="4.19">flashing recession slash depression</text>
  <text start="602.74" dur="4.21">actually we&amp;#39;ve been in a recession</text>
  <text start="604.66" dur="4.75">actually we&amp;#39;re heading into a depression</text>
  <text start="606.95" dur="5.31">because we&amp;#39;ve been in a recession quite</text>
  <text start="609.41" dur="4.29">a while right now again the government</text>
  <text start="612.26" dur="3.56">the corporate media they&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="613.7" dur="4.17">recognize this until much later on</text>
  <text start="615.82" dur="4.54">they&amp;#39;re gonna go back in time and say</text>
  <text start="617.87" dur="6.6">yes the recession started in February of</text>
  <text start="620.36" dur="8.419">2016 or March of 2016 but they won&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="624.47" dur="6.45">this until most likely the end of 2017</text>
  <text start="628.779" dur="6.131">when they start telling you how</text>
  <text start="630.92" dur="5.7">everything had happened we see Trump</text>
  <text start="634.91" dur="5.07">right now well he signed the executive</text>
  <text start="636.62" dur="5.58">order rolling back dodd-frank is this a</text>
  <text start="639.98" dur="4.52">good thing I don&amp;#39;t know as of yet</text>
  <text start="642.2" dur="4.98">because we can see right now that is</text>
  <text start="644.5" dur="6.25">Trump might be working for the banking</text>
  <text start="647.18" dur="6.12">system allowing the banks to have more</text>
  <text start="650.75" dur="5.85">flexibility and we have to understand</text>
  <text start="653.3" dur="5.88">that you know Trump began the process of</text>
  <text start="656.6" dur="5.37">undoing dodd-frank most likely with the</text>
  <text start="659.18" dur="5.849">help of Goldman bankers because Goldman</text>
  <text start="661.97" dur="4.53">bankers are on his staff and he hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="665.029" dur="5.821">mentioned anything about glass-steagall</text>
  <text start="666.5" dur="7.17">and that is one law that would truly</text>
  <text start="670.85" dur="5.34">protect depositors from runaway banker</text>
  <text start="673.67" dur="5.94">greed and this is something that needs</text>
  <text start="676.19" dur="6.66">to be put back into place because as we</text>
  <text start="679.61" dur="6">can see that was removed and allowed the</text>
  <text start="682.85" dur="6.06">banks to do whatever they wanted in</text>
  <text start="685.61" dur="5.64">regards to investments out in Utah there</text>
  <text start="688.91" dur="6.36">was a bill introduced into the Utah</text>
  <text start="691.25" dur="6.029">Legislature and it would bring on the</text>
  <text start="695.27" dur="4.53">state&amp;#39;s legal tender at creating a</text>
  <text start="697.279" dur="5.461">foundation for further action to</text>
  <text start="699.8" dur="5.64">encourage the use of gold and silver as</text>
  <text start="702.74" dur="4.65">money and take another step toward</text>
  <text start="705.44" dur="6.78">breaking the Federal Reserve&amp;#39;s monopoly</text>
  <text start="707.39" dur="9">on money so Utah is saying listen we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="712.22" dur="7.67">setting this up so we can actually dump</text>
  <text start="716.39" dur="6.81">the Fed dollar bill we can bypass it</text>
  <text start="719.89" dur="6.37">representative Ken ivory introduced</text>
  <text start="723.2" dur="5.61">House bill two to four On January 27th</text>
  <text start="726.26" dur="4.29">the legislation would add several</text>
  <text start="728.81" dur="3.42">provisions to state law designed to</text>
  <text start="730.55" dur="5.79">encourage the use of gold and silver as</text>
  <text start="732.23" dur="5.91">legal tender and the passage well it</text>
  <text start="736.34" dur="5.88">would set the stage for expansion of</text>
  <text start="738.14" dur="7.62">gold repositories in the state and what</text>
  <text start="742.22" dur="7.17">does that mean well it means that people</text>
  <text start="745.76" dur="6.21">would be able to use gold and silver to</text>
  <text start="749.39" dur="6.54">purchase things they can put it in the</text>
  <text start="751.97" dur="8.94">bank and hold it and they wouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="755.93" dur="7.46">to use the Fed dollar and this is</text>
  <text start="760.91" dur="6.39">something that states are allowed to do</text>
  <text start="763.39" dur="6.79">now states haven&amp;#39;t done this but they do</text>
  <text start="767.3" dur="4.53">have the right to do this because when</text>
  <text start="770.18" dur="5.34">you look at the united states</text>
  <text start="771.83" dur="6.36">constitution article 1 section 10 no</text>
  <text start="775.52" dur="6.44">State shall make anything but gold and</text>
  <text start="778.19" dur="6.96">silver coin a tender in payment of debts</text>
  <text start="781.96" dur="6.4">states have simply ignored this</text>
  <text start="785.15" dur="5.04">constitutional provision for years it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="788.36" dur="4.17">impossible for states to return to a</text>
  <text start="790.19" dur="5.16">constitutional sound money system when</text>
  <text start="792.53" dur="7.89">it taxes gold and silver as a commodity</text>
  <text start="795.35" dur="9.3">so they can definitely go ahead and do</text>
  <text start="800.42" dur="8.7">this and it bypasses the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="804.65" dur="9.15">completely now we know that Texas well</text>
  <text start="809.12" dur="6.39">they set up a gold bullion depository</text>
  <text start="813.8" dur="4.08">the governor Greg Abbott signed</text>
  <text start="815.51" dur="6.66">legislation back in June of 2015 which</text>
  <text start="817.88" dur="5.52">set this up and this is a facility that</text>
  <text start="822.17" dur="3.21">would provide a secure place for</text>
  <text start="823.4" dur="4.32">individuals businesses cities counties</text>
  <text start="825.38" dur="4.71">government the rest to store gold and</text>
  <text start="827.72" dur="6.26">other precious metals now according to</text>
  <text start="830.09" dur="8.25">the HB 2 to 4 this would also allow</text>
  <text start="833.98" dur="7.27">repositories to be set up and have</text>
  <text start="838.34" dur="5.01">special recognition by the state that</text>
  <text start="841.25" dur="6.56">would likely expand the market for their</text>
  <text start="843.35" dur="6.94">services so we can see we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="847.81" dur="4.07">moving in this direct</text>
  <text start="850.29" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re states are saying you know</text>
  <text start="851.88" dur="4.92">something we&amp;#39;re done with the central</text>
  <text start="853.89" dur="5.73">banking system we can have our own legal</text>
  <text start="856.8" dur="4.32">tender it is gold and silver under the</text>
  <text start="859.62" dur="3.36">Constitution the states do have the</text>
  <text start="861.12" dur="5.4">right to do this and we see already</text>
  <text start="862.98" dur="5.85">Texas we see now Utah and most likely</text>
  <text start="866.52" dur="4.23">this will spread from state to state the</text>
  <text start="868.83" dur="4.29">state now of course the central bankers</text>
  <text start="870.75" dur="4.17">are not going to like this the central</text>
  <text start="873.12" dur="5.67">bankers are going to look at this as a</text>
  <text start="874.92" dur="6.14">threat and most likely they&amp;#39;re gonna do</text>
  <text start="878.79" dur="5.78">whatever they possibly can to stop this</text>
  <text start="881.06" dur="6.7">because remember their system is</text>
  <text start="884.57" dur="6.07">controlling countries it&amp;#39;s putting them</text>
  <text start="887.76" dur="4.92">into debt they want you to use paper and</text>
  <text start="890.64" dur="5.4">ink they don&amp;#39;t want you to think of gold</text>
  <text start="892.68" dur="5.82">and silver as money it&amp;#39;s just for</text>
  <text start="896.04" dur="4.02">jewelry it&amp;#39;s just for you know for</text>
  <text start="898.5" dur="3.57">building electronics and things like</text>
  <text start="900.06" dur="4.5">that but it&amp;#39;s not really money the paper</text>
  <text start="902.07" dur="5.85">and ink that we create a thin air that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="904.56" dur="6.96">money and we know it&amp;#39;s not there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="907.92" dur="5.63">reason to have a central bank there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="911.52" dur="5.46">benefit to a central bank</text>
  <text start="913.55" dur="6.13">especially a private central bank that</text>
  <text start="916.98" dur="5.64">doesn&amp;#39;t act in the interest of the</text>
  <text start="919.68" dur="5.79">people of the country which charges</text>
  <text start="922.62" dur="5.16">interest on creating currency out of</text>
  <text start="925.47" dur="5.4">thin air there&amp;#39;s no reason to have it</text>
  <text start="927.78" dur="5.4">every government can create their own I</text>
  <text start="930.87" dur="4.5">mean the United States they print</text>
  <text start="933.18" dur="5.1">Treasury bills no problem guess what</text>
  <text start="935.37" dur="6.95">they can create currency they don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="938.28" dur="8.15">the central bank and you have to wonder</text>
  <text start="942.32" dur="6.49">why do Congress why does the president</text>
  <text start="946.43" dur="5.89">why do all these individuals even keep</text>
  <text start="948.81" dur="7.35">the central bank operational what</text>
  <text start="952.32" dur="6.06">benefit are they giving the people the</text>
  <text start="956.16" dur="4.32">only reason they there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="958.38" dur="3.99">operational is because they&amp;#39;re giving</text>
  <text start="960.48" dur="4.35">some type of kickback to all these</text>
  <text start="962.37" dur="5.37">individuals I mean think about it the</text>
  <text start="964.83" dur="6.42">Fed doesn&amp;#39;t even want to be audited they</text>
  <text start="967.74" dur="6.09">keep fighting it and that should tell</text>
