  <text start="150.64" dur="4.61">gops cover-up campaign to a new</text>
  <text start="153.22" dur="5.97">completely unacceptable unacceptable</text>
  <text start="155.25" dur="6.34">extreme both the DOJ and the FBI oppose</text>
  <text start="159.19" dur="4.049">releasing the Nunez memo as the</text>
  <text start="161.59" dur="2.82">Department of Justice warned the public</text>
  <text start="163.239" dur="3.951">release of the memo would be an</text>
  <text start="164.41" dur="6.63">unprecedented action and extraordinarily</text>
  <text start="167.19" dur="5.71">reckless the FBI also expressed the that</text>
  <text start="171.04" dur="4.32">the agency has grave concerns about</text>

  <text start="206.65" dur="4.77">to him and there&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff in</text>
  <text start="208.959" dur="6.331">this memo that refers to the FBI the FBI</text>
  <text start="211.42" dur="7.319">is very nervous about this because it</text>
  <text start="215.29" dur="6.33">could take the entire FBI down I mean</text>
  <text start="218.739" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;re gonna be shaken to their core</text>
  <text start="221.62" dur="4.56">when this comes out FBI director</text>
  <text start="224.139" dur="4.77">Christopher Rae told the White House</text>
  <text start="226.18" dur="4.259">that he opposes the memo and of course</text>
  <text start="228.909" dur="5.131">they keep saying it&amp;#39;s not accurate it</text>
  <text start="230.439" dur="6.351">was redone it&amp;#39;s not the same memo that</text>

  <text start="241.989" dur="3.9">whatever they possibly can to stop this</text>
  <text start="243.939" dur="3.991">from coming up because they know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="245.889" dur="4.32">going to be bad now are these people</text>
  <text start="247.93" dur="4.979">gonna run are these people going to</text>

  <text start="252.909" dur="6.75">up to what is coming we don&amp;#39;t know as of</text>
  <text start="256.69" dur="5.82">yet but they&amp;#39;re very nervous about this</text>
  <text start="259.659" dur="6.69">coming out now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="262.51" dur="8.37">about this is Robert Mueller now he made</text>
  <text start="266.349" dur="7.471">a request to postpone the sentencing of</text>
  <text start="270.88" dur="6.27">General Mike Flynn because what is</text>
  <text start="273.82" dur="5.52">happening right now is that Mueller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.15" dur="5.13">investigation began under false</text>
  <text start="279.34" dur="4.71">pretenses against the backdrop that the</text>
  <text start="282.28" dur="5.04">FBI surveillance wiretaps were obtained</text>
  <text start="284.05" dur="5.67">through materially false representations</text>
  <text start="287.32" dur="4.56">to the FISA Court and against the</text>
  <text start="289.72" dur="4.259">backdrop the original FISA judge was</text>
  <text start="291.88" dur="4.05">thermally recused from the case and</text>
  <text start="293.979" dur="4.261">against increasing evidence that Mike</text>
  <text start="295.93" dur="5.18">Flynn was set up by eight terminally</text>
  <text start="298.24" dur="5.609">animus and politically motivated</text>
  <text start="301.11" dur="4.96">investigative rogue unit operating</text>
  <text start="303.849" dur="4.531">within the FBI and again surfacing</text>
  <text start="306.07" dur="5.189">evidence that the FBI investigators</text>
  <text start="308.38" dur="6.18">manipulated their FD 302 interrogation</text>
  <text start="311.259" dur="7.081">documents so Mueller is now asking for a</text>
  <text start="314.56" dur="4.51">postponement of sentencing so what is</text>
  <text start="318.34" dur="4.49">happening</text>
  <text start="319.07" dur="6.46">well everything is going back to the</text>
  <text start="322.83" dur="5.46">Pfizer memo this is what they based</text>
  <text start="325.53" dur="6.44">everything on they based everything on</text>
  <text start="328.29" dur="6.63">the text between struck and page and</text>
  <text start="331.97" dur="6.61">everything that we&amp;#39;re looking at also</text>
  <text start="334.92" dur="6.51">feeds back to the Clinton emails it also</text>
  <text start="338.58" dur="5.61">feeds back to the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="341.43" dur="7.62">it also feeds back to the uranium one</text>
  <text start="344.19" dur="7.68">deal this whole thing is the start of</text>
  <text start="349.05" dur="6.57">bringing down the deep state the fuse</text>
  <text start="351.87" dur="6.75">has been lit now we don&amp;#39;t know what this</text>
  <text start="355.62" dur="4.65">memo says hopefully when it comes out</text>
  <text start="358.62" dur="3.65">maybe it&amp;#39;s gonna be on the unredacted</text>
  <text start="360.27" dur="4.35">version this way they can say hey look</text>
  <text start="362.27" dur="5.08">nothing was changed this is the original</text>
  <text start="364.62" dur="6.18">version here you go the public can read</text>
  <text start="367.35" dur="6.21">everything you can see how bad it is now</text>
  <text start="370.8" dur="6.72">if it comes out that way well the</text>
  <text start="373.56" dur="6.63">corporate media Schiff Pelosi Obama the</text>
  <text start="377.52" dur="5.1">rest they&amp;#39;re gonna be scrambling to</text>
  <text start="380.19" dur="5.07">figure out what to do here now we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="382.62" dur="5.16">have to see if certain individuals you</text>
  <text start="385.26" dur="4.7">know try to leave the country they</text>
  <text start="387.78" dur="4.5">disappear and they might even try to</text>
  <text start="389.96" dur="5.35">suicide themselves hopefully nobody does</text>
  <text start="392.28" dur="5.97">try this but we can see there&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="395.31" dur="5.97">become desperate they might try to do</text>
  <text start="398.25" dur="5.76">whatever they possibly can to avoid what</text>
  <text start="401.28" dur="4.8">is coming and this is going to be very</text>
  <text start="404.01" dur="4.17">interesting on how the corporate media</text>
  <text start="406.08" dur="4.2">plays this most likely they probably</text>
  <text start="408.18" dur="3.99">won&amp;#39;t report on it that long or they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="410.28" dur="3.99">deny everything they&amp;#39;ll say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="412.17" dur="4.98">inaccurate they&amp;#39;ll say it&amp;#39;s not real</text>
  <text start="414.27" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s Russian collusion it&amp;#39;s Russian bots</text>
  <text start="417.15" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s you know they&amp;#39;ll make up something</text>
  <text start="419.04" dur="4.52">where they&amp;#39;ll try to get around this</text>
  <text start="421.68" dur="5.76">whole thing this whole thing that is</text>
  <text start="423.56" dur="6.7">supported by a document that individual</text>
  <text start="427.44" dur="5.7">signed and people you know were aware of</text>
  <text start="430.26" dur="6.15">and you know what really happened here</text>
  <text start="433.14" dur="7.2">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to pretend that this</text>
  <text start="436.41" dur="7.5">isn&amp;#39;t real and we can see right now with</text>
  <text start="440.34" dur="7.38">the cover-up it&amp;#39;s really the deep state</text>
  <text start="443.91" dur="6.09">the cabal that is trying to cover up</text>
  <text start="447.72" dur="5.129">everything whenever they say something</text>
  <text start="450" dur="5.219">like oh the Republicans or</text>
  <text start="452.849" dur="5.61">Trump or anyone else they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="455.219" dur="5.49">you know push a cover-up they have</text>
  <text start="458.459" dur="4.651">Russian collusion they&amp;#39;re really talking</text>
  <text start="460.709" dur="5.85">about themselves they&amp;#39;re really telling</text>
  <text start="463.11" dur="5.759">you what they&amp;#39;ve done yes we had Russian</text>
  <text start="466.559" dur="4.021">collusion we dealt with Russia we sold</text>
  <text start="468.869" dur="3.121">them a uranium one we made a lot of</text>
  <text start="470.58" dur="4.109">money that was Obama</text>

  <text start="474.689" dur="3.57">cover-up with the Clinton emails yes</text>

  <text start="478.259" dur="5.28">memo yes we spied on American people</text>
  <text start="481.289" dur="7.65">they&amp;#39;re the ones who did all of this</text>
  <text start="483.539" dur="8.94">stuff we see out in Afghanistan the u.s.</text>
  <text start="488.939" dur="6.18">the Cabal the deep State has moved 7,000</text>
  <text start="492.479" dur="5.101">Islamic state fighters into this area</text>
  <text start="495.119" dur="4.59">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="497.58" dur="2.91">been at war in Afghanistan for a very</text>
  <text start="499.709" dur="3.871">long time</text>
  <text start="500.49" dur="7.219">and just like the war in Syria where the</text>
  <text start="503.58" dur="8.069">Islamic state gained ground in Syria</text>
  <text start="507.709" dur="7.12">after the u.s. was bombing like crazy</text>
  <text start="511.649" dur="5.911">and remember Obama was pointing to the</text>
  <text start="514.829" dur="5.161">targets didn&amp;#39;t let the Pentagon choose</text>
  <text start="517.56" dur="4.5">the targets Obama chose the targets of</text>
  <text start="519.99" dur="4.109">where to bomb and this was to allow the</text>
  <text start="522.06" dur="4.56">Islamic state to move further and</text>
  <text start="524.099" dur="5.16">further into Syria and take over more</text>
  <text start="526.62" dur="5.519">areas while the bombing destroyed the</text>
  <text start="529.259" dur="5.041">infrastructure of Syria in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="532.139" dur="5.521">right now we have 7,000 Islamic state</text>
  <text start="534.3" dur="7.38">fighters the Taliban fighters this is</text>
  <text start="537.66" dur="6.989">the people in Afghanistan that currently</text>
  <text start="541.68" dur="5.909">stands at around 60,000 or 70,000 now</text>
  <text start="544.649" dur="5.521">remember when we have regime change in a</text>
  <text start="547.589" dur="5.011">country all those people who are</text>
  <text start="550.17" dur="4.229">fighting the puppet government the u.s.</text>
  <text start="552.6" dur="3.65">the Cabal in the deep state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="554.399" dur="6.331">called terrorists happened in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="556.25" dur="6.819">happen in Iraq Lebanon Libya and the</text>
  <text start="560.73" dur="5.82">Taliban they controlled most of the</text>
  <text start="563.069" dur="5.7">country but what you need to understand</text>
  <text start="566.55" dur="4.769">is the deep state the cabal they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="568.769" dur="5.791">care about that because they control the</text>
  <text start="571.319" dur="5.58">government they control the natural</text>
  <text start="574.56" dur="4.62">resources they control the poppy fields</text>
  <text start="576.899" dur="4.05">they don&amp;#39;t care if the Taliban has the</text>
  <text start="579.18" dur="3.57">rest of the country and they&amp;#39;ll keep the</text>
  <text start="580.949" dur="4.32">war going on like this forever and ever</text>
  <text start="582.75" dur="4.1">and ever just so they can control and</text>
  <text start="585.269" dur="4.561">keep troops in the country</text>
  <text start="586.85" dur="3.64">Trump right now is bringing the troops</text>
  <text start="589.83" dur="4.08">in there</text>
  <text start="590.49" dur="6">not to maintain the poppy fields not to</text>
  <text start="593.91" dur="4.83">maintain what is happening but to remove</text>
  <text start="596.49" dur="5.46">the Islamic state fighters to remove</text>
  <text start="598.74" dur="6.09">what has been done in Afghanistan we see</text>
  <text start="601.95" dur="5.93">out in Ukraine well they just conducted</text>
  <text start="604.83" dur="7.37">the first ever cruise missile test and</text>
  <text start="607.88" dur="7.06">the test hit land and sea targets and</text>
  <text start="612.2" dur="4.09">this is their first missile and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="614.94" dur="5.46">saying they&amp;#39;re going to need this</text>
  <text start="616.29" dur="6.39">because of Russia Russia Russia</text>
  <text start="620.4" dur="4.5">now where&amp;#39;s the u.s. out there saying</text>
  <text start="622.68" dur="4.86">wait they just created this cruise</text>
  <text start="624.9" dur="4.83">missile because you know if Iran creates</text>
  <text start="627.54" dur="4.83">a missile that&amp;#39;s very dangerous but if</text>
  <text start="629.73" dur="4.04">Ukraine creates it it&amp;#39;s fine well we</text>
  <text start="632.37" dur="3.75">have a puppet government in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="633.77" dur="5.29">that&amp;#39;s why that is okay</text>
  <text start="636.12" dur="5.46">and we can see right now that this has</text>
  <text start="639.06" dur="4.77">nothing to do with Russian invasion</text>
  <text start="641.58" dur="4.26">Russia&amp;#39;s not going to invade Ukraine if</text>
  <text start="643.83" dur="5.16">they didn&amp;#39;t invade Ukraine Ukraine would</text>
  <text start="645.84" dur="6.09">be wiped out in a split second they</text>
  <text start="648.99" dur="4.74">won&amp;#39;t even be able to deal with it what</text>
  <text start="651.93" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re really doing is they&amp;#39;re creating</text>
  <text start="653.73" dur="5.04">and pushing these type of weapons to try</text>
  <text start="656.88" dur="4.74">to get back the other parts of the</text>
  <text start="658.77" dur="4.95">countries that have left and this is why</text>
  <text start="661.62" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re doing it now we need to</text>
  <text start="663.72" dur="6.48">understand that the Cabal the deep state</text>
  <text start="666.81" dur="6.33">they are going to be pushing different</text>
  <text start="670.2" dur="5.01">events moving forward and we know that</text>
  <text start="673.14" dur="3.48">there was a dump truck either the dump</text>
  <text start="675.21" dur="3.33">truck hit the train or the train hit the</text>
  <text start="676.62" dur="4.59">dump truck but it was in an area that</text>
  <text start="678.54" dur="4.77">was secure why was it there we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="681.21" dur="4.19">know and it now appears that there might</text>

  <text start="867.69" dur="4.17">real evidence real facts behind all of</text>
  <text start="871.26" dur="5.579">this</text>
  <text start="871.86" dur="7.32">the propaganda will not work this is</text>
  <text start="876.839" dur="4.68">what they&amp;#39;re most worried about because</text>
  <text start="879.18" dur="4.44">when things are written down and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="881.519" dur="5.13">actual signatures there&amp;#39;s actual</text>
  <text start="883.62" dur="5.67">documents that they filled out this is</text>
  <text start="886.649" dur="5.461">where the problem begins remember they</text>
  <text start="889.29" dur="4.62">didn&amp;#39;t care about hiding any of this</text>
  <text start="892.11" dur="3.839">because they thought they were going to</text>
  <text start="893.91" dur="5.34">be in the White House forever and no one</text>
  <text start="895.949" dur="5.091">was going to dig this stuff up that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="899.25" dur="5.699">why they don&amp;#39;t like Trump in there</text>
  <text start="901.04" dur="8.409">because he&amp;#39;s he has access to all of</text>
  <text start="904.949" dur="7.32">this stuff and once this memo comes out</text>
  <text start="909.449" dur="4.231">and from shift from Pelosi from the</text>
  <text start="912.269" dur="4.56">corporate media we can see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="913.68" dur="5.25">very very nervous about what is coming</text>
  <text start="916.829" dur="4.111">here and we can see that they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="918.93" dur="4.68">to push the propaganda before it even</text>
  <text start="920.94" dur="5.31">comes out about the inaccuracy with</text>
  <text start="923.61" dur="4.26">Pelosi writing a letter to newness and</text>
  <text start="926.25" dur="3.3">all this other stuff to I mean to the</text>
  <text start="927.87" dur="4.62">Speaker of the House we can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="929.55" dur="4.71">very very nervous so I don&amp;#39;t think the</text>
  <text start="932.49" dur="5.01">propaganda is going to work this time</text>
  <text start="934.26" dur="5.43">I think the sleeper cells that are</text>
  <text start="937.5" dur="6.899">around the country they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="939.69" dur="8.04">activated and they&amp;#39;re gonna create some</text>
  <text start="944.399" dur="4.5">type of an event and this event can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="947.73" dur="3.24">something small it&amp;#39;s not gonna be like a</text>
  <text start="948.899" dur="4.081">sleeper cells gonna say okay I get my</text>
  <text start="950.97" dur="5.34">orders and you know let&amp;#39;s have a shoot</text>
  <text start="952.98" dur="6.229">at a shootout at you know a store or at</text>
  <text start="956.31" dur="5.91">a concert because that&amp;#39;s not big enough</text>
  <text start="959.209" dur="8.231">you need something that&amp;#39;s going to clog</text>
  <text start="962.22" dur="7.2">the newsfeed for weeks on end to cover</text>
  <text start="967.44" dur="4.98">all of this up because this is just the</text>
  <text start="969.42" dur="5.399">beginning there&amp;#39;s more gonna be coming</text>
  <text start="972.42" dur="6.659">down the pike here so they&amp;#39;re gonna need</text>
  <text start="974.819" dur="8.46">something much much larger to pretty</text>
  <text start="979.079" dur="6.211">much shut down the corporate media from</text>
  <text start="983.279" dur="3.481">reporting anything that has to do with</text>
  <text start="985.29" dur="3.24">the memo so most</text>
  <text start="986.76" dur="3.84">the country doesn&amp;#39;t hear about this</text>
  <text start="988.53" dur="4.41">except those going to the alternative</text>
  <text start="990.6" dur="5.19">media but it&amp;#39;s not millions and millions</text>
  <text start="992.94" dur="6.6">of people this is the problem right now</text>
  <text start="995.79" dur="4.77">and we can see that this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="999.54" dur="3.78">going to do they&amp;#39;re gonna create</text>
  <text start="1000.56" dur="4.35">something so large now again we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1003.32" dur="5.97">mentioned many different things they can</text>
  <text start="1004.91" dur="6.27">do we have the Super Bowl I mean we have</text>
  <text start="1009.29" dur="4.65">North Korea where they&amp;#39;re saying they</text>
  <text start="1011.18" dur="4.8">have a ballistic missile they&amp;#39;ve told us</text>
  <text start="1013.94" dur="4.23">that we can&amp;#39;t intercept any of these</text>
  <text start="1015.98" dur="3.42">missiles I mean that would be the event</text>
  <text start="1018.17" dur="4.41">that they would need because if the</text>
  <text start="1019.4" dur="6.99">missile does hit outside of the country</text>
  <text start="1022.58" dur="6.27">in the ocean near Hawaii if it hits near</text>
  <text start="1026.39" dur="4.199">New York or anything like that and they</text>
  <text start="1028.85" dur="4.349">show that it came from North Korea and</text>
  <text start="1030.589" dur="5.761">the corporate media reports on that and</text>
  <text start="1033.199" dur="6.871">everyone is alarmed Congress is alarmed</text>
  <text start="1036.35" dur="6.18">and the those individuals who are on the</text>
  <text start="1040.07" dur="4.98">inside who are worried about the memo</text>
  <text start="1042.53" dur="4.77">push the idea that we need to go to war</text>
  <text start="1045.05" dur="6">this is where they&amp;#39;re gonna try to shift</text>
  <text start="1047.3" dur="5.73">the entire narrative and they can add on</text>
  <text start="1051.05" dur="4.5">to that maybe North Korea&amp;#39;s cyber</text>
  <text start="1053.03" dur="6.96">attacking us bringing down the economic</text>
  <text start="1055.55" dur="6.33">system and the whole thing basically</text>
  <text start="1059.99" dur="3.48">because of Trump&amp;#39;s policies and</text>
  <text start="1061.88" dur="4.89">everything will be blamed on Trump the</text>
  <text start="1063.47" dur="5.07">investigations will stop the narrative</text>
  <text start="1066.77" dur="4.83">will would have been shifted to</text>
  <text start="1068.54" dur="4.26">something else but once again we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1071.6" dur="2.79">know where it&amp;#39;s going to be we mentioned</text>
  <text start="1072.8" dur="5.33">many different things but we can see</text>
  <text start="1074.39" dur="6.72">right now whatever they have in store</text>
  <text start="1078.13" dur="6.48">the sleeper cells were put into place</text>
  <text start="1081.11" dur="7.02">they are ready to go they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1084.61" dur="7.57">trigger the sleeper cells they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1088.13" dur="7.56">to activate them and we most likely in</text>
  <text start="1092.18" dur="6.39">the next I would say week or two we or</text>
  <text start="1095.69" dur="4.74">maybe in the day in the next couple of</text>
  <text start="1098.57" dur="4.11">days we might see something happen all</text>
  <text start="1100.43" dur="4.17">depending on how the corporate media how</text>
  <text start="1102.68" dur="6.3">the deep state can control the narrative</text>
  <text start="1104.6" dur="7.65">if they lose control well it&amp;#39;s game over</text>
