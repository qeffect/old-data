  <text start="188.38" dur="5.67">there&amp;#39;s telling us that it is there</text>
  <text start="191.43" dur="5.14">we&amp;#39;ll be talking about that in a little</text>
  <text start="194.05" dur="5.31">bit but first let&amp;#39;s talk about what is</text>
  <text start="196.57" dur="6.06">happening with this economy now this</text>
  <text start="199.36" dur="5.79">economic system it has completely taken</text>
  <text start="202.63" dur="4.68">off under Trump of the Patriots now of</text>
  <text start="205.15" dur="4.05">course when Trump was coming into office</text>
  <text start="207.31" dur="3.66">the mainstream media Obama and the rest</text>
  <text start="209.2" dur="6.539">said it is completely impossible</text>
  <text start="210.97" dur="8.04">remember their entire mission was not to</text>
  <text start="215.739" dur="8.641">have the economy do well not to have</text>
  <text start="219.01" dur="8.22">people receive more income where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="224.38" dur="4.32">able to spend money in the economy now</text>
  <text start="227.23" dur="4.28">we need to put all this together and</text>
  <text start="228.7" dur="6.42">remember how Trump is working all this</text>
  <text start="231.51" dur="6.49">this is a central bank system he has to</text>
  <text start="235.12" dur="6.48">use the central bank system he has to</text>
  <text start="238" dur="7.17">use it to make sure that he can be</text>
  <text start="241.6" dur="5.93">re-elected in 2020 he just couldn&amp;#39;t shut</text>
  <text start="245.17" dur="5.43">it down there wouldn&amp;#39;t be enough time to</text>
  <text start="247.53" dur="4.269">bring back manufacturers renegotiate the</text>
  <text start="250.6" dur="4.68">trade deals and do everything that he</text>
  <text start="251.799" dur="6.031">needs to do so we had to use the system</text>
  <text start="255.28" dur="5.37">the way it is and one way of doing this</text>
  <text start="257.83" dur="4.89">is turning the system around making it</text>
  <text start="260.65" dur="5.13">seem like statistically the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="262.72" dur="5.73">doing well to push certain numbers like</text>
  <text start="265.78" dur="5.85">the GDP numbers up to push the stock</text>
  <text start="268.45" dur="4.77">market up these are all the weapons the</text>
  <text start="271.63" dur="4.14">central bank&amp;#39;s the deep state the</text>
  <text start="273.22" dur="5.58">mainstream media has been using is it</text>
  <text start="275.77" dur="5.25">that difficult to do in an in a in an</text>
  <text start="278.8" dur="3.679">economy that is completely manipulated</text>
  <text start="281.02" dur="6.03">no not really</text>
  <text start="282.479" dur="7.541">think about it when Obama was president</text>
  <text start="287.05" dur="4.53">you had Obamacare instead of taking</text>
  <text start="290.02" dur="4.019">those funds</text>
  <text start="291.58" dur="3.75">and spending in the economy you took</text>
  <text start="294.039" dur="4.491">those funds and you had to buy health</text>
  <text start="295.33" dur="6.209">insurance or you had to pay taxes so</text>
  <text start="298.53" dur="9.43">those funds were not being introduced</text>
  <text start="301.539" dur="9.361">into the economy and when we take our</text>
  <text start="307.96" dur="6.329">funds and we go ahead and we purchase</text>
  <text start="310.9" dur="5.789">items in retail that affects the GDP</text>
  <text start="314.289" dur="5.15">numbers right 70 percent of GDP here in</text>
  <text start="316.689" dur="7.561">the United States is made up of spending</text>
  <text start="319.439" dur="7.811">so what a Trump - he deregulated tax</text>
  <text start="324.25" dur="5.75">cuts put more money into the people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="327.25" dur="6.03">pockets got rid of the Obamacare tax</text>
  <text start="330" dur="5.409">that allowed individuals to have more</text>
  <text start="333.28" dur="2.699">funds in their pocket what do we see</text>
  <text start="335.409" dur="6.66">happen</text>
  <text start="335.979" dur="10.91">we saw the GDP numbers move up lower</text>

  <text start="346.889" dur="5.62">purchase homes to go to school to do</text>
  <text start="349.509" dur="6.96">whatever they need to do it keeps them</text>
  <text start="352.509" dur="5.551">in the arena it allows banks to reinvest</text>
  <text start="356.469" dur="3.841">into the stock market</text>

  <text start="638.35" dur="5.01">there was no real safe place to keep the</text>
  <text start="640.54" dur="4.859">gold so the gold was kept here</text>
  <text start="643.36" dur="4.83">there was a new economic deal Bretton</text>
  <text start="645.399" dur="6.3">Woods and they took gold and they set it</text>
  <text start="648.19" dur="5.329">at a certain price and we were stayed on</text>

  <text start="671.41" dur="8.31">there in Fort Knox and since that time</text>
  <text start="675.66" dur="8.02">there really haven&amp;#39;t been many public</text>
  <text start="679.72" dur="6.869">audits showing the gold in Fort Knox and</text>
  <text start="683.68" dur="4.38">this individual Jan knew in-house I</text>

  <text start="1045.98" dur="4.65">supposed to happen did happen</text>
  <text start="1048.29" dur="4.68">vault compartments that had been</text>
  <text start="1050.63" dur="5.46">physically verified and sealed were</text>
  <text start="1052.97" dur="4.98">reopened from the 1986 audit report</text>
  <text start="1056.09" dur="5.19">regarding the Fort Knox and Denver</text>
  <text start="1057.95" dur="8.22">depositories it shows on page 8 and page</text>
  <text start="1061.28" dur="9.42">9 that for some reason the seals were</text>
  <text start="1066.17" dur="9.09">broken so for some reason starting in 83</text>
  <text start="1070.7" dur="6.57">rhe audits were performed over 1929 tons</text>
  <text start="1075.26" dur="5.54">in accordance with the plan approved by</text>
  <text start="1077.27" dur="6.27">the treasurer however in 1983 both</text>
  <text start="1080.8" dur="5.17">depositories had already been fully</text>
  <text start="1083.54" dur="4.92">ordered while West Point had not why</text>
  <text start="1085.97" dur="4.89">were these compartments reopened when</text>
  <text start="1088.46" dur="3.959">the protocol stated these actions</text>
  <text start="1090.86" dur="3.99">physical verification</text>
  <text start="1092.419" dur="4.801">having once been performed will not have</text>
  <text start="1094.85" dur="4.529">to be repeated as long as the assets</text>
  <text start="1097.22" dur="6.569">verified remain under an unimpaired</text>
  <text start="1099.379" dur="7.471">joint seal the oh I the OIG can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1103.789" dur="6.151">explain this and neither can it explain</text>
  <text start="1106.85" dur="6.12">what the plan approved by the treasurer</text>
  <text start="1109.94" dur="5.91">was so under oath the order to Thorson</text>
  <text start="1112.97" dur="5.639">he carefully avoided the subject of</text>
  <text start="1115.85" dur="5.279">reopening compartments and in another</text>
  <text start="1118.609" dur="4.05">written statement the same auditor lied</text>
  <text start="1121.129" dur="3.93">about the subject of reopening</text>
  <text start="1122.659" dur="5.7">compartments so the question is under</text>
  <text start="1125.059" dur="4.5">the rules these compartments were never</text>
  <text start="1128.359" dur="5.04">supposed to be reopened</text>
  <text start="1129.559" dur="6.901">why were they now the question is since</text>
  <text start="1133.399" dur="8.071">they were reopened is there gold in</text>
  <text start="1136.46" dur="7.529">these compartments so the entire theory</text>
  <text start="1141.47" dur="5.819">of is there gold in Fort Knox</text>
  <text start="1143.989" dur="7.38">well it was audited it was sealed then</text>
  <text start="1147.289" dur="6.96">the seals were broken is the gold still</text>
  <text start="1151.369" dur="5.79">there well there&amp;#39;s only one reason you</text>
  <text start="1154.249" dur="5.61">would break a seal it wouldn&amp;#39;t be to</text>
  <text start="1157.159" dur="6.14">reorder it it would go in it would be to</text>
  <text start="1159.859" dur="6.211">go in and get the gold so someone is</text>
  <text start="1163.299" dur="4.931">covering up for someone else I mean hey</text>
  <text start="1166.07" dur="4.979">we just saw this with the Pfizer report</text>
  <text start="1168.23" dur="6.96">where we had individuals change emails</text>
  <text start="1171.049" dur="6.391">they didn&amp;#39;t follow the rules going up</text>
  <text start="1175.19" dur="7.219">the chain we&amp;#39;re seeing the same thing</text>
  <text start="1177.44" dur="8.64">here and once again we have a problem</text>
  <text start="1182.409" dur="6.61">remember the entire system is made up of</text>
  <text start="1186.08" dur="6.179">the deep state of the central banks they</text>
  <text start="1189.019" dur="6.47">cover for each other they hide important</text>
  <text start="1192.259" dur="6.091">information and we can see already</text>
