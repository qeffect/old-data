  <text start="218.23" dur="8.85">economic growth in the eurozone is down</text>
  <text start="224.19" dur="6.94">point three percent in march through</text>
  <text start="227.08" dur="5.97">June and it&amp;#39;s that they were expecting</text>

  <text start="233.05" dur="6.72">wasn&amp;#39;t now who&amp;#39;s leading the way in all</text>
  <text start="236.26" dur="6.3">this it&amp;#39;s France and Italy and it looks</text>
  <text start="239.77" dur="5.16">like France basically is completely</text>
  <text start="242.56" dur="4.41">falling apart I know they keep can they</text>
  <text start="244.93" dur="3.39">they continually say that they&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="246.97" dur="4.29">recovery things are getting better</text>
  <text start="248.32" dur="6.3">unemployment is going down but here we</text>
  <text start="251.26" dur="5.94">are once again where things are starting</text>
  <text start="254.62" dur="6.51">to fall apart I mean we see France and</text>
  <text start="257.2" dur="6.36">we see Italy the third which is the</text>
  <text start="261.13" dur="5.33">third largest economy they saw a growth</text>

  <text start="268.87" dur="5.16">around 40 percent of the annual eurozone</text>
  <text start="271.3" dur="4.89">GDP so their fortunes are key to the</text>
  <text start="274.03" dur="4.85">right to the wider region right now and</text>
  <text start="276.19" dur="5.67">we see that this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="278.88" dur="5.44">basically having a domino effect and</text>
  <text start="281.86" dur="6.81">it&amp;#39;s now starting to spread to all of</text>
  <text start="284.32" dur="8.43">these countries but you know what people</text>
  <text start="288.67" dur="7.499">in Europe in China Russia they all</text>
  <text start="292.75" dur="4.62">realize that this system is not looking</text>
  <text start="296.169" dur="3.271">good there feeling</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="3.93">right now and they want to protect</text>
  <text start="299.44" dur="5.34">themselves and basically what&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="317.68" dur="5.04">gold bars and coins at a rapid pace in</text>
  <text start="319.96" dur="6.63">the second quarter as they&amp;#39;ve looked at</text>
  <text start="322.72" dur="7.77">the turmoil in Greece and they were</text>
  <text start="326.59" dur="6.93">threatening to basically leave the</text>
  <text start="330.49" dur="5.52">eurozone and they got very nervous the</text>
  <text start="333.52" dur="4.44">World Council said demand in Europe for</text>
  <text start="336.01" dur="4.32">the precious metal rose sharply in the</text>
  <text start="337.96" dur="4.32">three months to june can&amp;#39;t compare to</text>
  <text start="340.33" dur="4.77">the same quarter of last year the</text>
  <text start="342.28" dur="6.44">increase in Europe was led by Germany</text>

  <text start="360.639" dur="6.571">Hewitt from the world gold council</text>
  <text start="363.96" dur="5.29">wealth is eroded in many ways it could</text>
  <text start="367.21" dur="3.929">be through high inflation currency</text>
  <text start="369.25" dur="5.639">weakness it could be that people want to</text>
  <text start="371.139" dur="5.551">hedge their risk gold plays a really</text>
  <text start="374.889" dur="3.871">strong role in this but here in the</text>
  <text start="376.69" dur="6.09">United States they&amp;#39;re trying to keep us</text>
  <text start="378.76" dur="6.48">convinced that gold and silver they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="382.78" dur="4.71">not worth having hold on to your paper</text>
  <text start="385.24" dur="4.35">because paper and ink that&amp;#39;s worth</text>
  <text start="387.49" dur="5.459">something gold and silver not worth</text>
  <text start="389.59" dur="6.53">anything well you know what gold you</text>
  <text start="392.949" dur="7.741">have to look at as a wealth preserver</text>
  <text start="396.12" dur="8.59">things go down they fall apart this will</text>
  <text start="400.69" dur="8.28">help protect you paper and ink will not</text>
  <text start="404.71" dur="7.47">and here in the United States we know</text>
  <text start="408.97" dur="7.71">things are getting worse and worse as</text>
  <text start="412.18" dur="6.48">each day passes people in the United</text>
  <text start="416.68" dur="4.41">States realize it they just can&amp;#39;t put</text>
  <text start="418.66" dur="3.87">their finger on it a lot of people going</text>
  <text start="421.09" dur="2.97">to the new media alternative media</text>
  <text start="422.53" dur="3.41">whatever you want to call them and</text>
  <text start="424.06" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re starting to hear things that</text>
  <text start="425.94" dur="4.33">counter what the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="428.8" dur="2.43">saying what the US government saying</text>
  <text start="430.27" dur="2.85">what the Fed is</text>
  <text start="431.23" dur="4.74">and they&amp;#39;re scratching their head saying</text>
  <text start="433.12" dur="6.21">yeah that makes sense so right now the</text>
  <text start="435.97" dur="5.25">US consumer they are losing faith August</text>
  <text start="439.33" dur="4.65">preliminary Yuma consumer sentiment</text>
  <text start="441.22" dur="5.76">slipped from July&amp;#39;s 93.1 and missed</text>
  <text start="443.98" dur="8.34">expectations this is the second weakest</text>
  <text start="446.98" dur="8.85">print since November we see business</text>
  <text start="452.32" dur="9.09">expectations are now at eleven month</text>
  <text start="455.83" dur="7.7">lows so businesses consumers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="461.41" dur="6.42">looking at this and they&amp;#39;re saying yeah</text>
  <text start="463.53" dur="8.56">something is wrong something is going on</text>
  <text start="467.83" dur="6.03">in the economy and of course if they</text>
  <text start="472.09" dur="3.57">continually list to listen to the</text>
  <text start="473.86" dur="4.05">corporate media to the fed to the US</text>
  <text start="475.66" dur="4.02">government they&amp;#39;ll just keep telling</text>
  <text start="477.91" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;ll just big they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="479.68" dur="3.06">continually telling them that no no</text>
  <text start="481.81" dur="6.72">don&amp;#39;t worry about that we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="482.74" dur="7.86">recovery now we know that those people</text>
  <text start="488.53" dur="5.82">who are losing their jobs in major</text>
  <text start="490.6" dur="6.03">corporations they&amp;#39;re going to apply for</text>
  <text start="494.35" dur="5.63">unemployment but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="496.63" dur="6.54">is that the initial jobless claims</text>
  <text start="499.98" dur="5.29">basically continually go lower now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="503.17" dur="3.66">seeing major layoffs it&amp;#39;s not by at like</text>
  <text start="505.27" dur="3.65">you know five people here at ten people</text>
  <text start="506.83" dur="6.57">there we&amp;#39;re seeing thousands of people</text>
  <text start="508.92" dur="7.27">but right now we&amp;#39;re at 42 year lows in</text>
  <text start="513.4" dur="5.85">the fourth week average of initial</text>
  <text start="516.19" dur="5.729">jobless claims but what&amp;#39;s but when you</text>
  <text start="519.25" dur="7.23">look at this and you see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="521.919" dur="7.861">happening we see that we are headed</text>
  <text start="526.48" dur="8.52">towards another crash I&amp;#39;ll give an</text>
  <text start="529.78" dur="10.74">example back in two thousand seven to</text>
  <text start="535" dur="8.97">two thousand nine we saw the initial</text>
  <text start="540.52" dur="4.79">jobless claims rise dramatically and of</text>
  <text start="543.97" dur="4.95">course that was the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="545.31" dur="6.97">previous to that going from the year</text>
  <text start="548.92" dur="7.89">2001 all the way up to two thousand</text>
  <text start="552.28" dur="9.2">seven initial jobless claims continually</text>
  <text start="556.81" dur="7.38">fell they fell to their lowest level</text>
  <text start="561.48" dur="3.49">during this time and then we hit 2008</text>
  <text start="564.19" dur="2.819">and</text>
  <text start="564.97" dur="4.08">things completely fell apart and we know</text>
  <text start="567.009" dur="5.76">back in two thousand one that was a</text>
  <text start="569.05" dur="5.849">recession so we can see at this point in</text>
  <text start="572.769" dur="5.25">time we are following the same path now</text>
  <text start="574.899" dur="7.29">if we go back further in time and we go</text>
  <text start="578.019" dur="8.49">to the year nineteen ninety-one to about</text>
  <text start="582.189" dur="6.45">19 to about in 1999 we see the same</text>
  <text start="586.509" dur="4.741">thing occur the initial jobless claims</text>
  <text start="588.639" dur="4.411">came right down to the point that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="591.25" dur="5.22">at right now and then all of a sudden in</text>
  <text start="593.05" dur="8.25">2001 we were in a recession so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="596.47" dur="7.83">following the same exact path and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="601.3" dur="5.43">at that point in the initial jobless</text>
  <text start="604.3" dur="6.57">claims where this doesn&amp;#39;t even make</text>
  <text start="606.73" dur="6.359">sense anymore and we can see that this</text>
  <text start="610.87" dur="6.329">is going to lead into the complete</text>
  <text start="613.089" dur="7.31">collapse of the system and layoffs are</text>
  <text start="617.199" dur="7.021">continuing lenovo is going to be cutting</text>
  <text start="620.399" dur="5.831">3,200 jobs because of sales that are</text>
  <text start="624.22" dur="4.169">completely down and profits that are</text>
  <text start="626.23" dur="4.89">tumbled motorola is going to be laying</text>

  <text start="637.089" dur="10.19">I mean this is continually happening</text>
  <text start="641.8" dur="9.779">every single day and it&amp;#39;s not improving</text>
  <text start="647.279" dur="7.18">now industrial production rose and</text>
  <text start="651.579" dur="4.56">everyone&amp;#39;s clapping their hands wow this</text>
  <text start="654.459" dur="5.581">is fantastic but when we look back in</text>
  <text start="656.139" dur="6.45">time we see that they basically revised</text>
  <text start="660.04" dur="5.76">all the numbers once again industrial</text>
  <text start="662.589" dur="4.381">production in July rose about 0.6% they</text>
  <text start="665.8" dur="3">thought it was only going to rise point</text>
  <text start="666.97" dur="5.76">three percent how did they do this well</text>
  <text start="668.8" dur="6.57">they revised everything negative going</text>
  <text start="672.73" dur="8.01">backwards so the rise today would look</text>
  <text start="675.37" dur="10.439">much better and we saw a huge surge in</text>
  <text start="680.74" dur="9.48">Auto inventory to sales and this made</text>
  <text start="685.809" dur="6.691">everything look a lot better and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="690.22" dur="6.599">having a major problem in the auto</text>
  <text start="692.5" dur="5.61">industry right now basically what they</text>
  <text start="696.819" dur="4.651">did was they continually</text>
  <text start="698.11" dur="6.51">produced cars a massive production surge</text>
  <text start="701.47" dur="7.02">and they basically stuffed the</text>
  <text start="704.62" dur="6.87">dealerships with cars there at the</text>
  <text start="708.49" dur="4.95">record highs right now and this right</text>
  <text start="711.49" dur="5.67">now has been rising for about sixty one</text>
  <text start="713.44" dur="6.389">straight months and at this point in</text>
  <text start="717.16" dur="7.739">time there&amp;#39;s not enough people to</text>
  <text start="719.829" dur="8.281">purchase these cars and the sales are</text>
  <text start="724.899" dur="4.711">not keeping up with the inventories</text>
  <text start="728.11" dur="4.77">things are starting to break apart</text>
  <text start="729.61" dur="5.46">things are starting to fall they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="732.88" dur="4.949">find the sub-prime people anymore</text>
  <text start="735.07" dur="6.57">they&amp;#39;re tapped out there doing whatever</text>
  <text start="737.829" dur="6.601">they possibly can and every time they</text>
  <text start="741.64" dur="6.72">try to do something which will bring in</text>
  <text start="744.43" dur="5.25">more people it&amp;#39;s get it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s fewer and</text>

  <text start="749.68" dur="6.57">purchasing the cars so what happens next</text>
  <text start="753.64" dur="4.889">well we&amp;#39;re going to see a production</text>
  <text start="756.25" dur="4.68">slump we&amp;#39;re going to see the auto</text>
  <text start="758.529" dur="4.201">industry completely crash because we</text>
  <text start="760.93" dur="4.32">know this is a bubble that&amp;#39;s all this is</text>
  <text start="762.73" dur="4.89">this is a bubble just like the stock</text>
  <text start="765.25" dur="6.3">market just like the student loan debt</text>
  <text start="767.62" dur="10.909">just like the Treasury bond market it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="771.55" dur="10.469">all the same now we understand that</text>
  <text start="778.529" dur="6.55">retail sales are completely falling</text>
  <text start="782.019" dur="6.091">apart now at this point in time they</text>
  <text start="785.079" dur="6.151">came out with their new statistics about</text>
  <text start="788.11" dur="4.89">retail sales and it was right in line</text>
  <text start="791.23" dur="3.96">with what they expected a point six</text>
  <text start="793" dur="3.779">percent rise now of course this was help</text>
  <text start="795.19" dur="4.62">with front this was all helped by the</text>
  <text start="796.779" dur="4.651">auto industry they manufactured they</text>
  <text start="799.81" dur="3.99">pushed the cars out there they got the</text>
  <text start="801.43" dur="4.71">subprime people in there and they push</text>
  <text start="803.8" dur="4.159">this very hard to get the point six</text>
  <text start="806.14" dur="4.65">percent rise but you have to remember</text>
  <text start="807.959" dur="5.921">retail sales have been falling all along</text>
  <text start="810.79" dur="7.88">this little bump is not going to do</text>
  <text start="813.88" dur="7.68">anything and we are seeing red warning</text>
  <text start="818.67" dur="4.72">flashing lights everywhere because when</text>
  <text start="821.56" dur="4.11">we look at it what drove a lot of this</text>
  <text start="823.39" dur="3.75">is the auto industry and food and</text>
  <text start="825.67" dur="3.029">beverage I mean if we look at other</text>
  <text start="827.14" dur="4.89">things like electronic and appliance</text>
  <text start="828.699" dur="8.581">stores down- one-point-two percent</text>
  <text start="832.03" dur="6.54">I mean terrible if we look at general</text>
  <text start="837.28" dur="6">merchandise stores department stores</text>
  <text start="838.57" dur="6.9">negative point eight percent so what</text>
  <text start="843.28" dur="6.78">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now we&amp;#39;re seeing them</text>
  <text start="845.47" dur="6.69">push the agenda trying to keep the story</text>
  <text start="850.06" dur="5.28">alive that we&amp;#39;re in a recovery but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="852.16" dur="6.45">really not and as this economic collapse</text>
  <text start="855.34" dur="4.83">moves forward and it brings in more</text>
  <text start="858.61" dur="3.18">people because as these people lose</text>
  <text start="860.17" dur="3.3">their job they realize what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="861.79" dur="4.14">they can&amp;#39;t find a job they have to get a</text>
  <text start="863.47" dur="4.8">bar time job what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="865.93" dur="6.66">more Americans now are going to the food</text>
  <text start="868.27" dur="7.2">banks applying for food stamps 46</text>
  <text start="872.59" dur="6.3">million Americans are now going to food</text>
  <text start="875.47" dur="6.9">banks and the lines are getting longer</text>
  <text start="878.89" dur="5.76">and longer this year it is projected</text>
  <text start="882.37" dur="4.77">that food banks in United States will</text>
  <text start="884.65" dur="4.95">give away an all-time record of four</text>
  <text start="887.14" dur="4.32">billion pounds of food over the past</text>
  <text start="889.6" dur="4.41">decade that number has more than doubled</text>
  <text start="891.46" dur="5.34">and the number would even be higher if</text>
  <text start="894.01" dur="5.37">food banks had more to give away the</text>
  <text start="896.8" dur="4.8">demand has become so crushing that some</text>
  <text start="899.38" dur="3.66">food banks have actually reduced the</text>
  <text start="901.6" dur="6.21">amount of food that they&amp;#39;re giving to</text>
  <text start="903.04" dur="7.65">each family this is how bad it is so</text>
  <text start="907.81" dur="5.34">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="910.69" dur="4.47">people are standing on these lines to</text>
  <text start="913.15" dur="4.95">feed their families just like we saw</text>
  <text start="915.16" dur="4.92">back in 1929 a lot of it is hidden</text>
  <text start="918.1" dur="6.06">because a lot of people are getting food</text>
  <text start="920.08" dur="5.55">stamps and those people who can&amp;#39;t feed</text>
  <text start="924.16" dur="4.35">their families just on food stamps they</text>
  <text start="925.63" dur="6.21">end up going to the food banks and the</text>
  <text start="928.51" dur="6.72">demand is getting so great that pretty</text>
  <text start="931.84" dur="5.28">soon this whole type of system is not</text>
  <text start="935.23" dur="4.14">going to be able to keep up and this is</text>
  <text start="937.12" dur="5.7">what we&amp;#39;re seeing at this point now in</text>
  <text start="939.37" dur="4.74">the housing industry we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="942.82" dur="3.68">mortgage rates tick up and if these</text>
  <text start="944.11" dur="4.44">mortgage rates do go up much higher</text>
  <text start="946.5" dur="4.15">mortgage applications are going to</text>
  <text start="948.55" dur="3.39">completely implode on themselves I mean</text>
  <text start="950.65" dur="2.52">this is what&amp;#39;s been happening all along</text>
  <text start="951.94" dur="3.6">and they&amp;#39;re trying to keep this interest</text>
  <text start="953.17" dur="3.6">rates as low as possible but according</text>
  <text start="955.54" dur="4.11">to the Mortgage Bankers Association</text>

  <text start="962.49" dur="7.1">decreased by four percent</text>
  <text start="965.81" dur="5.55">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see this in the</text>
  <text start="969.59" dur="3.81">housing industry where people are saying</text>
  <text start="971.36" dur="5.1">okay this is out of my league right now</text>
  <text start="973.4" dur="5.04">I can&amp;#39;t purchase a house and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="976.46" dur="5.79">taking out the mortgages and this will</text>
  <text start="978.44" dur="5.76">continually occur as time goes on the</text>
  <text start="982.25" dur="5.3">whole system is falling apart it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="984.2" dur="6.81">getting better it&amp;#39;s getting worse as we</text>
  <text start="987.55" dur="7.42">continually report on this the collapse</text>
  <text start="991.01" dur="6.18">is actually here we just haven&amp;#39;t had the</text>
  <text start="994.97" dur="4.83">government to say yes we&amp;#39;re in trouble</text>
  <text start="997.19" dur="3.93">and of course everyone&amp;#39;s looking at the</text>
  <text start="999.8" dur="3.81">stock market because that&amp;#39;s the last</text>
  <text start="1001.12" dur="5.42">indicator and when we look at our</text>
  <text start="1003.61" dur="6.66">exports here in the country we see that</text>
  <text start="1006.54" dur="7.45">exports have fallen off the chart us</text>
  <text start="1010.27" dur="5.009">containerized exports are imploding on</text>
  <text start="1013.99" dur="3.36">themselves now of course they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1015.279" dur="5.191">it&amp;#39;s a dollar which is going to cheat</text>
  <text start="1017.35" dur="6.66">which is surging higher but we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1020.47" dur="5.849">other anomalies in the market and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1024.01" dur="3.929">starting to see those people that we</text>

  <text start="1027.939" dur="6.121">they&amp;#39;re not purchasing so basically what</text>
  <text start="1031.839" dur="6.931">we&amp;#39;re seeing is this whole system</text>
  <text start="1034.06" dur="7.44">starting to full apart global trade had</text>
  <text start="1038.77" dur="7.97">essentially come to a halt during the</text>
  <text start="1041.5" dur="8.07">financial crisis back in 2008 by 2010</text>
  <text start="1046.74" dur="5.86">container export activity began to surge</text>
  <text start="1049.57" dur="5.99">from very low levels and be became part</text>
  <text start="1052.6" dur="8.7">of the v-shaped recovery it peaked in</text>
  <text start="1055.56" dur="8.71">2011 and now what are we saying it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1061.3" dur="5.85">starting to get worse once again it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1064.27" dur="4.5">completely dropping now in 2015 it is</text>
  <text start="1067.15" dur="4.74">pretty much dropped to the lowest point</text>
  <text start="1068.77" dur="7.23">almost back to where we were back when</text>
  <text start="1071.89" dur="7.23">we had the crash of 2008 so this system</text>
  <text start="1076" dur="6.3">is completely falling apart all over the</text>
  <text start="1079.12" dur="4.83">place now this economy I mean when we</text>
  <text start="1082.3" dur="3.96">look all around here we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1083.95" dur="4.8">indicators all over the place and there</text>
  <text start="1086.26" dur="4.41">are a lot of signs to let us know that</text>
  <text start="1088.75" dur="3.81">things are completely falling apart I</text>
