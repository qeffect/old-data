  <text start="56.28" dur="5.07">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="57.63" dur="6.48">episode 1575 a and today&amp;#39;s date is May</text>
  <text start="61.35" dur="5.16">23rd 2018 and thought of the episode is</text>
  <text start="64.11" dur="6.33">proof that the central bank fiat</text>
  <text start="66.51" dur="6.48">currency is dying let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="70.44" dur="4.38">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="72.99" dur="4.769">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about all these</text>
  <text start="74.82" dur="4.89">economic indicators and we&amp;#39;ve delve into</text>
  <text start="77.759" dur="3.901">them and they&amp;#39;re basically showing us</text>
  <text start="79.71" dur="4.26">that were in a recession headed for</text>
  <text start="81.66" dur="3.9">recession I do believe we&amp;#39;re already in</text>
  <text start="83.97" dur="4.62">that recession it&amp;#39;s just being covered</text>
  <text start="85.56" dur="6.15">up by statistical illusionary tricks</text>
  <text start="88.59" dur="5.94">that the government the Fed are using</text>
  <text start="91.71" dur="5.04">just like in 2008 way before the</text>
  <text start="94.53" dur="4.11">recession was announced we were already</text>
  <text start="96.75" dur="3.6">in a recession think about it the</text>
  <text start="98.64" dur="5.22">subprime securities were rated triple-a</text>
  <text start="100.35" dur="5.67">that was fake that wasn&amp;#39;t real they</text>
  <text start="103.86" dur="5.64">people were basing their investments on</text>
  <text start="106.02" dur="6.11">fake information the same thing is</text>
  <text start="109.5" dur="6.33">happening right now people are basing</text>
  <text start="112.13" dur="5.41">all of what they do on what the</text>
  <text start="115.83" dur="3.21">corporate media is putting out there</text>
  <text start="117.54" dur="5.55">what the government is putting out there</text>
  <text start="119.04" dur="8.7">and all of it is fake the system is</text>
  <text start="123.09" dur="7.709">breaking down and it is a race to see</text>
  <text start="127.74" dur="6.48">who controls the narrative remember we</text>
  <text start="130.799" dur="5.611">are in a system that was created by the</text>
  <text start="134.22" dur="4.019">central banking system this isn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="136.41" dur="3.21">founding father system that they created</text>
  <text start="138.239" dur="4.441">and I&amp;#39;m talking about the monetary</text>
  <text start="139.62" dur="4.56">system this is a system back in 1913</text>
  <text start="142.68" dur="5.01">when the central bank came into</text>
  <text start="144.18" dur="6.42">existence this is their system and their</text>
  <text start="147.69" dur="8.1">system does not work for the people</text>
  <text start="150.6" dur="9.57">their system only works for them and it</text>
  <text start="155.79" dur="6.78">dies every 4045 years and basically what</text>
  <text start="160.17" dur="4.95">has been happening is their system dies</text>
  <text start="162.57" dur="5.16">and then it has to be reintroduced it</text>
  <text start="165.12" dur="4.47">dies it has to be reintroduced and this</text>
  <text start="167.73" dur="5.46">is what they&amp;#39;ve been doing over time</text>
  <text start="169.59" dur="5.31">just like from 1945 after the war and</text>
  <text start="173.19" dur="3.69">they usually like to have Wars and</text>
  <text start="174.9" dur="5.58">events so they can cover it up and say</text>
  <text start="176.88" dur="5.4">ok let&amp;#39;s restart the system 1945 where</text>
  <text start="180.48" dur="5.06">the system was restarted all the way up</text>
  <text start="182.28" dur="4.65">to the 70s I mean we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="185.54" dur="4.119">30-something</text>
  <text start="186.93" dur="4.649">plus years and they restarted the system</text>
  <text start="189.659" dur="5.25">and they took us off the gold standard</text>
  <text start="191.579" dur="5.49">and now we hear 40 plus years they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="194.909" dur="4.651">going to do it again but there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="197.069" dur="5.221">problem they need to control the</text>
  <text start="199.56" dur="4.739">narrative and the key players are no</text>
  <text start="202.29" dur="4.74">longer in place this is their major</text>
  <text start="204.299" dur="5.28">problem right now because they had it</text>
  <text start="207.03" dur="5.01">planned they thought they were going to</text>
  <text start="209.579" dur="4.921">have their key players all in place but</text>
  <text start="212.04" dur="3.69">the whole thing is falling apart but we</text>
  <text start="214.5" dur="4.17">can see that things are breaking down</text>
  <text start="215.73" dur="5.67">very very quickly and we see that banks</text>
  <text start="218.67" dur="3.929">they are preparing for this now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="221.4" dur="2.82">seeing many banks throughout Europe</text>
  <text start="222.599" dur="3.351">they&amp;#39;re having a huge amount of trouble</text>
  <text start="224.22" dur="4.139">we&amp;#39;ve talked about this in other reports</text>
  <text start="225.95" dur="4.03">where most of them are insolvent and</text>
  <text start="228.359" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re gonna go down with the ship and</text>
  <text start="229.98" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s gonna spread to other banks and we</text>
  <text start="231.989" dur="2.991">see there are certain banks and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="233.34" dur="5.19">gonna be many more than just this one</text>
  <text start="234.98" dur="6.459">they&amp;#39;re gonna start to restructure which</text>
  <text start="238.53" dur="6.239">means lay off a lot of people and try to</text>
  <text start="241.439" dur="4.981">prepare for what is coming now about a</text>
  <text start="244.769" dur="3.271">month ago we reported at Deutsche Bank</text>
  <text start="246.42" dur="3.75">was gonna cut about a thousand jobs and</text>
  <text start="248.04" dur="4.8">was it with the big deal thousand jobs</text>
  <text start="250.17" dur="4.529">not a big deal and we said well most</text>
  <text start="252.84" dur="6.209">likely this is gonna be a lot more than</text>
  <text start="254.699" dur="8.911">just a thousand jobs now they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="259.049" dur="6.811">to eliminate ten thousand jobs that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="263.61" dur="3.809">about one in ten employees</text>
  <text start="265.86" dur="3.36">I think this numbers gonna go a little</text>
  <text start="267.419" dur="3.24">bit higher and we&amp;#39;re gonna hear other</text>
  <text start="269.22" dur="4.14">banks come out and say they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="270.659" dur="6.661">restructure also because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="273.36" dur="8.67">preparing for what is coming and what is</text>
  <text start="277.32" dur="9">coming is akin total implosion of the</text>
  <text start="282.03" dur="6.389">system that is what is coming and we see</text>
  <text start="286.32" dur="3.36">right now this is what they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="288.419" dur="3.93">prepared for because what we could see</text>
  <text start="289.68" dur="5.88">in the economy things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="292.349" dur="6.391">falling apart we see new home sales they</text>
  <text start="295.56" dur="6.09">have slid again in April and they have</text>
  <text start="298.74" dur="5.07">dropped by 1.5% month-on-month</text>
  <text start="301.65" dur="3.42">and basically the housing market is just</text>
  <text start="303.81" dur="3.09">bouncing around and this is a way the</text>
  <text start="305.07" dur="3.81">central bankers kind of like it they</text>
  <text start="306.9" dur="3.81">like to have it bounce around really not</text>
  <text start="308.88" dur="3.029">go nowhere because they know as they</text>
  <text start="310.71" dur="3.66">raise the interest rates it&amp;#39;s just gonna</text>
  <text start="311.909" dur="3.721">get worse because reef eyes are under</text>
  <text start="314.37" dur="3.599">the Klein mortgage apps are gonna</text>
  <text start="315.63" dur="3.99">decline it&amp;#39;s all gonna decline and they</text>
  <text start="317.969" dur="2.731">understand this they did this back in</text>
  <text start="319.62" dur="4.53">2000</text>
  <text start="320.7" dur="4.65">seven leading into the 2008-2009 Great</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="2.76">Recession where they were raising</text>
  <text start="325.35" dur="2.85">interest rates and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="326.91" dur="4.07">everything started to break down the</text>
  <text start="328.2" dur="6.06">same thing is happening here once again</text>
  <text start="330.98" dur="5.53">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting as mortgage</text>
  <text start="334.26" dur="5.09">applications decline and refinancing</text>
  <text start="336.51" dur="8.55">declines we see and sales are declining</text>
  <text start="339.35" dur="9.64">we see new home sell prices on homes</text>
  <text start="345.06" dur="7.73">they are increasing there at all-time</text>
  <text start="348.99" dur="7.68">highs right now which is kind of odd and</text>
  <text start="352.79" dur="7.3">we can see that this whole strange</text>
  <text start="356.67" dur="5.27">economy is continuing on because when</text>
  <text start="360.09" dur="5.07">you manipulate everything when you</text>
  <text start="361.94" dur="6.16">completely manipulate everything all</text>
  <text start="365.16" dur="5.45">around you everything doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="368.1" dur="4.62">and we&amp;#39;re living in an illusionary</text>
  <text start="370.61" dur="4.03">economic system just like we were back</text>
  <text start="372.72" dur="3.84">in 2008 where everyone thought oh my</text>
  <text start="374.64" dur="3.57">house is gonna continually rise the</text>
  <text start="376.56" dur="4.29">stock market&amp;#39;s gonna continually move up</text>
  <text start="378.21" dur="4.05">our sales are gonna continually rise</text>
  <text start="380.85" dur="3.36">everything&amp;#39;s going to be great</text>
  <text start="382.26" dur="3.75">retail is going to continually expand</text>
  <text start="384.21" dur="4.14">and then everything started to break</text>
  <text start="386.01" dur="6.69">down the same thing is happening right</text>
  <text start="388.35" dur="8.34">now now the dollar the fiat currency</text>
  <text start="392.7" dur="6.15">that is losing value like there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="396.69" dur="3.51">tomorrow since the central bank has come</text>
  <text start="398.85" dur="3.36">into existence since they took us off</text>
  <text start="400.2" dur="5.1">the gold standard since they started to</text>
  <text start="402.21" dur="6.36">create currency like crazy the value of</text>
  <text start="405.3" dur="6.24">fiat currency continually loses its</text>
  <text start="408.57" dur="5.75">value now gold switch &amp;#39;ln recently</text>
  <text start="411.54" dur="6.33">reported that in the two decades since</text>
  <text start="414.32" dur="8.29">1999 the dollar has devalued against</text>
  <text start="417.87" dur="6.81">gold by over 80 percent the currencies</text>
  <text start="422.61" dur="4.59">of countries like Argentina Venezuela</text>
  <text start="424.68" dur="5.85">were one strong and appeared just as</text>
  <text start="427.2" dur="5.88">invincible as the US dollar Argentina</text>
  <text start="430.53" dur="5.13">has suffered one economic setback after</text>
  <text start="433.08" dur="4.5">another in the last few decades leaving</text>
  <text start="435.66" dur="5.85">the peso 95 percent weaker than it was</text>
  <text start="437.58" dur="5.64">in 2001 Venezuela is no better with a</text>
  <text start="441.51" dur="3.99">currency that has lost about ninety nine</text>
  <text start="443.22" dur="3.96">point seven percent and we know the u.s.</text>
  <text start="445.5" dur="4.14">the deep state has been pushing</text>
  <text start="447.18" dur="4.44">Venezuela placing sanctions on Venezuela</text>
  <text start="449.64" dur="3.93">because they really want regime change</text>
  <text start="451.62" dur="2.88">that&amp;#39;s the endgame there but we can see</text>
  <text start="453.57" dur="2.43">Venezuela many</text>
  <text start="454.5" dur="3.27">the countries are turning away from the</text>
  <text start="456" dur="5.04">dollar and moving towards other</text>
  <text start="457.77" dur="6.18">currencies or cryptocurrency and we see</text>
  <text start="461.04" dur="6.77">right now that they have lost value</text>
  <text start="463.95" dur="7.38">there now gold Switzerland noted if</text>
  <text start="467.81" dur="7.51">wealthy Argentinians and Venezuelans had</text>
  <text start="471.33" dur="5.94">kept their savings in gold they would be</text>
  <text start="475.32" dur="4.95">in a very good position right now in</text>
  <text start="477.27" dur="7.29">fact they would be living like kings in</text>
  <text start="480.27" dur="5.64">their home country very few people hold</text>
  <text start="484.56" dur="2.88">gold or understand the importance of</text>
  <text start="485.91" dur="3.27">gold for wealth preservation right now</text>
  <text start="487.44" dur="4.86">they don&amp;#39;t understand what is happening</text>
  <text start="489.18" dur="5.3">in origin Tina Venezuela will stew will</text>
  <text start="492.3" dur="5.16">soon happen here in Western countries</text>
  <text start="494.48" dur="4.39">all of these bubbles all the lies</text>
  <text start="497.46" dur="4.23">everything that we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="498.87" dur="4.56">eventually going to come to an end it</text>
  <text start="501.69" dur="4.47">always does and for those people who</text>
  <text start="503.43" dur="6.89">think it&amp;#39;s not go back in history and</text>
  <text start="506.16" dur="7.08">check it out nothing lasts forever and</text>
  <text start="510.32" dur="5.44">things always come to an end</text>
  <text start="513.24" dur="4.59">especially when it&amp;#39;s manipulated</text>
  <text start="515.76" dur="6.089">especially when it&amp;#39;s a system that is</text>
  <text start="517.83" dur="9.39">designed to implode after 40 to 45 years</text>
  <text start="521.849" dur="8.49">and when you start to look at the fight</text>
  <text start="527.22" dur="6.48">currency compared to gold with a 100</text>
  <text start="530.339" dur="5.731">year historical chart it shows that</text>
  <text start="533.7" dur="4.53">though prices have fluctuated up and</text>
  <text start="536.07" dur="4.17">down and remember there&amp;#39;s manipulation</text>
  <text start="538.23" dur="7.98">in the gold and precious metals market</text>
  <text start="540.24" dur="11.81">even with manipulation guess what gold</text>
  <text start="546.21" dur="9.87">still retains its value and consistently</text>
  <text start="552.05" dur="6.73">rises over the years while an ounce of</text>
  <text start="556.08" dur="6.03">gold would have cost you just over 482</text>
  <text start="558.78" dur="5.73">back in 1915 the same ounce of gold gold</text>
  <text start="562.11" dur="5.13">would now set you back one thousand</text>
  <text start="564.51" dur="4.41">three hundred and ten dollars the dollar</text>
  <text start="567.24" dur="3.72">on the other hand is backed by</text>
  <text start="568.92" dur="3.87">absolutely nothing but debt because</text>
  <text start="570.96" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s what the central bank does it</text>
  <text start="572.79" dur="4.799">backs everything by debt because it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="574.86" dur="6.47">debt based system it&amp;#39;s collapse is</text>
  <text start="577.589" dur="5.881">inevitable the national deficit has</text>
  <text start="581.33" dur="4.81">consistently increased year after year</text>
  <text start="583.47" dur="4.9">since 1957 a trend that is not</text>
  <text start="586.14" dur="5.98">sustainable indefinitely</text>
  <text start="588.37" dur="6.779">and basically what has happened here is</text>
  <text start="592.12" dur="6.629">as the Fayette currencies continually</text>
  <text start="595.149" dur="7.56">lose value gold which is a store of</text>
  <text start="598.749" dur="6.601">wealth well it holds its value it</text>
  <text start="602.709" dur="6.661">increases at fire as finance current</text>
  <text start="605.35" dur="6.56">fiat currency declines and this is what</text>
  <text start="609.37" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing over time even as</text>
  <text start="611.91" dur="4.57">precious metals are completely</text>
  <text start="614.35" dur="6.12">manipulated by the central bank they</text>
  <text start="616.48" dur="6.18">can&amp;#39;t bring it down to 300 or 200 or</text>
  <text start="620.47" dur="4.679">what it wouldn&amp;#39;t even make sense so they</text>
  <text start="622.66" dur="4.409">keep it at a place where it kind of</text>
  <text start="625.149" dur="4.56">makes sense to people that this is where</text>
  <text start="627.069" dur="3.721">gold and silver would be of course those</text>
  <text start="629.709" dur="2.221">who are working in the gold and silver</text>
  <text start="630.79" dur="3.359">industry say this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="631.93" dur="4.98">ridiculous and those people looking at</text>
  <text start="634.149" dur="4.68">the economic turmoil throughout the</text>
  <text start="636.91" dur="3.979">world say this is ridiculous but for the</text>
  <text start="638.829" dur="4.2">average for the average everyday person</text>
  <text start="640.889" dur="4.51">they&amp;#39;re looking at this and then they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="643.029" dur="5.641">saying yeah this is about right this is</text>
  <text start="645.399" dur="5.55">what it should be but in reality without</text>
  <text start="648.67" dur="6.289">the manipulation just take this all the</text>
  <text start="650.949" dur="8.041">way what happens gold prices soar</text>
  <text start="654.959" dur="6.581">because the dollar has lost value and</text>
  <text start="658.99" dur="4.92">just like with Argentina Venezuela and</text>
  <text start="661.54" dur="4.709">many other countries as the fiat</text>
  <text start="663.91" dur="4.979">currency continually lose value as they</text>
  <text start="666.249" dur="5.491">create more currency as they try to push</text>
  <text start="668.889" dur="7.081">out more debt and bonds guess what</text>
  <text start="671.74" dur="5.49">happens to gold it protects you and this</text>
  <text start="675.97" dur="5.63">is what we&amp;#39;ve been talking about all</text>
  <text start="677.23" dur="8.99">along and we can see that the dollar</text>
  <text start="681.6" dur="8.079">that day of collapsing and imploding and</text>
  <text start="686.22" dur="6.729">having the dollar destroyed it is coming</text>
  <text start="689.679" dur="4.65">and it&amp;#39;s coming much quicker than I</text>

  <text start="817.33" dur="5.4">have been asking for the gold back</text>
  <text start="820.66" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s a reason for this there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="822.73" dur="5.01">reason why Russia and China have been</text>
  <text start="824.92" dur="5.67">purchasing a huge amount of gold there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="827.74" dur="5.52">a reason why central bankers demonize</text>
  <text start="830.59" dur="5.88">gold and silver and crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="833.26" dur="4.56">and I know many people out there don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="836.47" dur="3.48">believe in crypto currencies and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="837.82" dur="3.78">fine you don&amp;#39;t have to you know what the</text>
  <text start="839.95" dur="4.29">believe in gold and silver either you</text>
  <text start="841.6" dur="5.07">can believe in the Fayette currency the</text>
  <text start="844.24" dur="6.99">central bank puts out there but just be</text>
  <text start="846.67" dur="8.94">warned when that crashes and burns like</text>
  <text start="851.23" dur="10.46">it always does you&amp;#39;re going to lose out</text>
  <text start="855.61" dur="8.55">just like during the 2006 2007 2008</text>
  <text start="861.69" dur="4.089">years when everyone was out there and</text>
  <text start="864.16" dur="2.97">the corporate media was out there the</text>
  <text start="865.779" dur="4.291">central bank was out there telling you</text>
  <text start="867.13" dur="6.06">that real estate doesn&amp;#39;t go down real</text>
  <text start="870.07" dur="7.38">estate is contained it will not lose</text>
  <text start="873.19" dur="7.11">value you will be fine don&amp;#39;t worry about</text>
  <text start="877.45" dur="5.759">and guess what we&amp;#39;re not forecasting any</text>
  <text start="880.3" dur="4.62">type of recession anytime soon of course</text>
  <text start="883.209" dur="3.69">this was saying that they said this in</text>
  <text start="884.92" dur="4.52">the year that we had the recession you</text>
  <text start="886.899" dur="5.551">can believe all that that&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="889.44" dur="5.79">but when the system as they lie to you</text>
  <text start="892.45" dur="5.46">and the system completely breaks down</text>
  <text start="895.23" dur="5.47">you&amp;#39;re going to be left with absolutely</text>
  <text start="897.91" dur="4.919">nothing think about all those people in</text>
  <text start="900.7" dur="5.37">Venezuela and Argentina like we said if</text>
  <text start="902.829" dur="6.271">they purchase gold before everything</text>
  <text start="906.07" dur="6.259">started to go south they&amp;#39;d be pretty</text>
  <text start="909.1" dur="8.85">well off right now if you purchase gold</text>
  <text start="912.329" dur="8.611">back in the 40s the 50s the 60s the 80s</text>
  <text start="917.95" dur="7.68">the 90s in 2000</text>
  <text start="920.94" dur="7">you&amp;#39;d be pretty well off right now you</text>
  <text start="925.63" dur="3.63">would have ensured your wealth because</text>
  <text start="927.94" dur="4.139">when you see inflation</text>
  <text start="929.26" dur="3.9">it doesn&amp;#39;t mean the item is actually</text>
  <text start="932.079" dur="5.461">getting more expensive</text>
  <text start="933.16" dur="6.929">it means the dollar is losing its value</text>
  <text start="937.54" dur="5.609">and you need more of those dollars just</text>
  <text start="940.089" dur="7.081">to afford that item the item doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="943.149" dur="7.891">change actually the process of creating</text>
  <text start="947.17" dur="7.2">a lot of these items is streamlined and</text>
  <text start="951.04" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s easier and cheaper to create them</text>
  <text start="954.37" dur="6.12">but the reason why you&amp;#39;re paying more</text>
  <text start="956.92" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s because the dollar lost its value</text>
  <text start="960.49" dur="5.25">and it&amp;#39;s losing its value every day you</text>
  <text start="962.17" dur="6.39">can see it every time you see the price</text>
  <text start="965.74" dur="5.49">go up on food or anything else it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="968.56" dur="8.01">because the dollar just lost more of its</text>
  <text start="971.23" dur="7.2">value that is what you&amp;#39;re seeing so you</text>
  <text start="976.57" dur="3.959">need to be ready and prepared you need</text>
  <text start="978.43" dur="6.33">to understand what is happening because</text>
  <text start="980.529" dur="5.581">eventually it will hit the US and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="984.76" dur="2.61">going to hit pretty darn hard because</text>
  <text start="986.11" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;re the reserve currency of the world</text>
  <text start="987.37" dur="4.35">and when it does</text>
