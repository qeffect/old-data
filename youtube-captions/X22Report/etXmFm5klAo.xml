  <text start="60.039" dur="6.33">episode is the TPP has been rewritten</text>
  <text start="63.059" dur="6.431">shrouded in secrecy and is worse than</text>
  <text start="66.369" dur="5.521">before let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="69.49" dur="4.35">collapse financial news now out in</text>
  <text start="71.89" dur="4.8">europe they&amp;#39;ve been telling us that the</text>
  <text start="73.84" dur="6.36">european countries they&amp;#39;re doing very</text>
  <text start="76.69" dur="6.87">well Manufacturing&amp;#39;s up everything looks</text>
  <text start="80.2" dur="6.72">great and then we get information that</text>
  <text start="83.56" dur="5.339">the eurozone economy well it grew less</text>
  <text start="86.92" dur="4.77">than initially estimated in the last</text>
  <text start="88.899" dur="4.741">quarter of last year as industrial</text>
  <text start="91.69" dur="5.25">output recorded the worst fall in over</text>
  <text start="93.64" dur="6.149">four years in december and this is what</text>
  <text start="96.94" dur="6.62">the central banks these governments do</text>
  <text start="99.789" dur="7.801">they put out information which is</text>
  <text start="103.56" dur="6.07">propaganda manipulated information and</text>
  <text start="107.59" dur="4.47">they put that out into the news and</text>
  <text start="109.63" dur="4.409">everyone thinks that the eurozone united</text>
  <text start="112.06" dur="3.659">states and the rest of the private</text>
  <text start="114.039" dur="4.591">wasn&amp;#39;t central playing countries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="115.719" dur="5.76">doing fantastically and then all of a</text>
  <text start="118.63" dur="4.76">sudden they wait and they go back months</text>
  <text start="121.479" dur="4.201">later and they start revising the data</text>
  <text start="123.39" dur="4.479">we see it happen in the united states</text>
  <text start="125.68" dur="4.109">all the time because what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="127.869" dur="4.321">is they&amp;#39;re putting out the propaganda</text>
  <text start="129.789" dur="5.01">but they never report that oh here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="132.19" dur="4.44">headline we just revised the information</text>
  <text start="134.799" dur="3.181">for december it was a lot worse than we</text>
  <text start="136.63" dur="3.18">thought the economy is not doing as well</text>
  <text start="137.98" dur="4.44">as we thought no they never mention that</text>
  <text start="139.81" dur="4.649">part they just leave it as oh the</text>
  <text start="142.42" dur="4.53">economy is doing great in december look</text>
  <text start="144.459" dur="4.56">at these numbers and then februari or</text>
  <text start="146.95" dur="3.629">march or whatever the time frame is they</text>
  <text start="149.019" dur="3.72">go back and say okay let&amp;#39;s quietly</text>
  <text start="150.579" dur="4.111">revise them down that really didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="152.739" dur="3.421">the way they were the economy didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="154.69" dur="4.56">really didn&amp;#39;t do what it was supposed to</text>
  <text start="156.16" dur="4.5">and no one will know and this way if</text>
  <text start="159.25" dur="4.53">they revised the numbers down far enough</text>
  <text start="160.66" dur="4.409">they can boost the numbers for the next</text>
  <text start="163.78" dur="3.39">quarter and this is what we see</text>
  <text start="165.069" dur="4.681">happening now it&amp;#39;s happening in the</text>
  <text start="167.17" dur="5.539">european union they&amp;#39;re doing the same</text>
  <text start="169.75" dur="6.06">exact thing where the nineteen countries</text>
  <text start="172.709" dur="5.56">well they saw a growth of 0 point for</text>
  <text start="175.81" dur="5.73">point five percent it was lowered 2.4%</text>
  <text start="178.269" dur="4.92">and what we&amp;#39;re going to see is</text>
  <text start="181.54" dur="4.259">this is going to be revised probably</text>
  <text start="183.189" dur="5.041">once again probably down two-point-three</text>
  <text start="185.799" dur="4.951">percent because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="188.23" dur="5.61">now is there&amp;#39;s no way that these</text>
  <text start="190.75" dur="5.969">economies are doing well many of the</text>
  <text start="193.84" dur="7.099">countries in the euro zone have a huge</text>
  <text start="196.719" dur="8.701">amount of debt we see Italy France</text>
  <text start="200.939" dur="7.45">Greece we know the UK they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="205.42" dur="5.899">leave the EU they don&amp;#39;t even want to be</text>
  <text start="208.389" dur="7.02">a part of it anymore because</text>
  <text start="211.319" dur="6.551">unemployment is continually rising their</text>
  <text start="215.409" dur="5.28">economies aren&amp;#39;t doing as well as being</text>
  <text start="217.87" dur="6.239">which is being reported and things are</text>
  <text start="220.689" dur="6.66">declining very rapidly now here in the</text>
  <text start="224.109" dur="5.611">United States American CEOs they have</text>
  <text start="227.349" dur="5.961">never been more optimistic than they are</text>
  <text start="229.72" dur="6.449">today which is absolutely meaningless</text>
  <text start="233.31" dur="5.23">because as you know as a CEO of a</text>
  <text start="236.169" dur="5.19">company what they look at is the bottom</text>
  <text start="238.54" dur="5.61">line now if they lay off 5,000 people</text>
  <text start="241.359" dur="6.06">they buy back their shares shares are up</text>
  <text start="244.15" dur="8.459">they think wow everything is fantastic</text>
  <text start="247.419" dur="7.65">look how well we are doing but sales are</text>
  <text start="252.609" dur="5.331">down revenues not coming in but they</text>
  <text start="255.069" dur="6.061">don&amp;#39;t care about that they only look at</text>
  <text start="257.94" dur="5.71">cutting costs and continually pushing</text>
  <text start="261.13" dur="6.09">their stocks higher if that&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="263.65" dur="6.21">they feel good so this really is</text>
  <text start="267.22" dur="5.669">completely meaningless now while these</text>
  <text start="269.86" dur="7.049">CEOs are feeling fantastic we see that</text>
  <text start="272.889" dur="7.56">credit Swiss is announcing another 6500</text>
  <text start="276.909" dur="7.201">layoffs after reporting a loss in 2016</text>
  <text start="280.449" dur="5.761">and we can see right now that this is</text>
  <text start="284.11" dur="4.98">continually happening where companies</text>
  <text start="286.21" dur="5.22">they cannot make it and they&amp;#39;re laying</text>
  <text start="289.09" dur="4.74">off thousands of people now we know that</text>
  <text start="291.43" dur="3.84">Trump is continually trying to say he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="293.83" dur="3.75">bringing back drops but he hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="295.27" dur="4.8">created any and he won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="297.58" dur="4.14">create any even though he&amp;#39;s making deals</text>
  <text start="300.07" dur="4.469">with these companies it&amp;#39;s all a</text>
  <text start="301.72" dur="4.89">publicity stunt at this point because if</text>
  <text start="304.539" dur="4.711">you look at all the companies for GM and</text>
  <text start="306.61" dur="5.369">the rest there&amp;#39;s their plans to move to</text>
  <text start="309.25" dur="5.91">Mexico well it&amp;#39;s still happening they</text>
  <text start="311.979" dur="5.581">haven&amp;#39;t changed their plans</text>
  <text start="315.16" dur="4.23">and we&amp;#39;re seeing that nothing has</text>
  <text start="317.56" dur="3.75">changed right now in the economy</text>
  <text start="319.39" dur="4.98">actually things are changing it is</text>
  <text start="321.31" dur="7.53">getting worse and worse as more and more</text>
  <text start="324.37" dur="6.93">people get get laid off that means less</text>
  <text start="328.84" dur="4.53">income is coming in which means less</text>
  <text start="331.3" dur="3.9">revenue is going to the government now</text>
  <text start="333.37" dur="5.55">we have to remember something very</text>
  <text start="335.2" dur="6.39">important here the US consumer spends</text>
  <text start="338.92" dur="7.53">one dollar in every three dollars in the</text>
  <text start="341.59" dur="8.01">world and it is this that really gives</text>
  <text start="346.45" dur="6.24">them their power and why China fears</text>
  <text start="349.6" dur="7.29">Carol&amp;#39;s the global economy is dependent</text>
  <text start="352.69" dur="6.84">on us consumption now think about this</text>
  <text start="356.89" dur="7.41">for a second what has been happening</text>
  <text start="359.53" dur="8.4">lately well individuals have been laid</text>
  <text start="364.3" dur="6.03">off they either can&amp;#39;t find work or they</text>
  <text start="367.93" dur="6.54">find part-time work which means they</text>
  <text start="370.33" dur="6.24">don&amp;#39;t have the disposable income if they</text>
  <text start="374.47" dur="4.71">don&amp;#39;t have the disposable income they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="376.57" dur="6.3">not going out to retail to purchase</text>
  <text start="379.18" dur="7.05">goods retail then contracts we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="382.87" dur="6.24">retail contract if retail contracts the</text>
  <text start="386.23" dur="6.38">factories well they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="389.11" dur="6.42">produce industrial output will decrease</text>
  <text start="392.61" dur="6.16">the climb that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing if</text>
  <text start="395.53" dur="6.66">that declines then the factories don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="398.77" dur="7.37">need the raw materials this is what we</text>
  <text start="402.19" dur="6.68">are seeing right now which means that</text>
  <text start="406.14" dur="5.41">the people here in the United States</text>
  <text start="408.87" dur="6.1">they don&amp;#39;t have the ability to go out</text>
  <text start="411.55" dur="5.55">and spend which means manufacturing</text>
  <text start="414.97" dur="5.67">companies like China they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="417.1" dur="7.38">slow down and this is a ripple effect</text>
  <text start="420.64" dur="5.82">throughout the world because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="424.48" dur="3.689">seeing right now is that everything is</text>
  <text start="426.46" dur="3.9">pretty much dependent on the United</text>
  <text start="428.169" dur="4.441">States there was a time where we have</text>
  <text start="430.36" dur="4.2">the manufacturing we had the jobs people</text>
  <text start="432.61" dur="6.39">had disposable income and they were out</text>
  <text start="434.56" dur="7.44">there spending but since that time it</text>
  <text start="439" dur="5.96">doesn&amp;#39;t exist and things are contracting</text>
  <text start="442" dur="6.81">all over the place look at our GDP it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="444.96" dur="5.95">like 1.5 or one-point-eight percent</text>
  <text start="448.81" dur="3.72">actually that&amp;#39;s the manipulated number</text>
  <text start="450.91" dur="5.13">if we look at the real number it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="452.53" dur="5.91">the negative range and since Britain</text>
  <text start="456.04" dur="5.19">woods where they had this global</text>
  <text start="458.44" dur="5.51">recycling system well that is breaking</text>
  <text start="461.23" dur="6.5">down right now the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="463.95" dur="8.92">polarized it&amp;#39;s not doing anything and</text>
  <text start="467.73" dur="7.45">the whole thing is basically dead that</text>
  <text start="472.87" dur="4.11">is what is happening right now so when</text>
  <text start="475.18" dur="3.81">people say well China is going to be the</text>
  <text start="476.98" dur="4.38">trigger for all of us actually no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="478.99" dur="4.08">the United States because the people</text>
  <text start="481.36" dur="4.23">have no work the people aren&amp;#39;t spending</text>
  <text start="483.07" dur="5.25">I mean it&amp;#39;s going to look like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="485.59" dur="5.01">China but really it really comes from</text>
  <text start="488.32" dur="4.62">the United States because what these</text>
  <text start="490.6" dur="4.379">individuals have done is they have moved</text>
  <text start="492.94" dur="4.199">the manufacturing out of the United</text>
  <text start="494.979" dur="4.381">States move the jobs at ignite cigs we</text>
  <text start="497.139" dur="5.641">become a service industry and there is</text>
  <text start="499.36" dur="8.13">no country that can survive as a service</text>
  <text start="502.78" dur="7.74">industry it just won&amp;#39;t work this is why</text>
  <text start="507.49" dur="4.799">they&amp;#39;re looking to test the universal</text>
  <text start="510.52" dur="4.41">basic income it looks like California</text>
  <text start="512.289" dur="3.991">might be a test case where they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="514.93" dur="3.09">to try this where they&amp;#39;re just going to</text>
  <text start="516.28" dur="4.05">give everyone you know a couple hundred</text>
  <text start="518.02" dur="3.899">dollars and they&amp;#39;re going to hope that</text>
  <text start="520.33" dur="4.41">these people go out and they spend the</text>
  <text start="521.919" dur="5.131">money well just like when the gas prices</text>
  <text start="524.74" dur="4.41">came way way down people didn&amp;#39;t go out</text>
  <text start="527.05" dur="6.51">and take that extra money and spend it</text>
  <text start="529.15" dur="6.75">on a retail they saved it because people</text>
  <text start="533.56" dur="4.8">realize listen I&amp;#39;m not making a lot of</text>
  <text start="535.9" dur="4.53">money right now are making no money I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="538.36" dur="4.77">not going to spend it on junk I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="540.43" dur="5.28">need it I need food I need to pay my</text>
  <text start="543.13" dur="6.209">rent I need to pay my electric that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="545.71" dur="6.27">all they&amp;#39;re going to do that&amp;#39;s it when</text>
  <text start="549.339" dur="4.861">you see the GDP with spending that is</text>
  <text start="551.98" dur="5.34">from Obamacare premiums continually</text>
  <text start="554.2" dur="6.06">moved up up up up up which made GDP move</text>
  <text start="557.32" dur="5.34">up where they said oh look spending is</text>
  <text start="560.26" dur="7.019">incredible now strip away Obamacare</text>
  <text start="562.66" dur="6.929">spending is a disaster so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="567.279" dur="5.701">seeing right now is things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="569.589" dur="7.921">falling apart now during Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="572.98" dur="9.38">campaign he said a lot of things about</text>
  <text start="577.51" dur="7.86">the Fed here&amp;#39;s a list of five</text>
  <text start="582.36" dur="5.8">Janet Yellen is highly political he said</text>
  <text start="585.37" dur="5.34">this November third 2015 when her time</text>
  <text start="588.16" dur="5.49">is up I would most likely replace her</text>
  <text start="590.71" dur="5.48">that&amp;#39;s may fit 2016 the thread has</text>
  <text start="593.65" dur="5.91">created a very false economy</text>
  <text start="596.19" dur="5.68">septemberfest 2016 she&amp;#39;s doing what</text>
  <text start="599.56" dur="4.98">Obama wants her to do that September 12</text>
  <text start="601.87" dur="6.99">2016 Yellen should be ashamed of herself</text>
  <text start="604.54" dur="8.37">sep tember 12 2016 now we know that Rand</text>
  <text start="608.86" dur="6.39">Paul Ted Cruz they are looking to audit</text>
  <text start="612.91" dur="4.71">the Fed we know the Fed does not want to</text>
  <text start="615.25" dur="4.89">be audited because of course it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="617.62" dur="4.11">private corporation and if we ordered</text>
  <text start="620.14" dur="5.28">them we&amp;#39;re going to find out a lot of</text>
  <text start="621.73" dur="5.25">things we do not like now Trump by</text>
  <text start="625.42" dur="3.09">saying all these things gave the</text>
  <text start="626.98" dur="6.81">impression that he&amp;#39;s going to go after</text>
  <text start="628.51" dur="9.59">the Fed and at this point in time so far</text>
  <text start="633.79" dur="7.29">he has not this is the leading problem</text>
  <text start="638.1" dur="6.64">around the world the central bank the</text>
  <text start="641.08" dur="6.87">central bank is the problem because they</text>
  <text start="644.74" dur="6.21">deal in debt they put countries into</text>
  <text start="647.95" dur="7.77">debt they create wars when their system</text>
  <text start="650.95" dur="7.89">breaks down and if Trump doesn&amp;#39;t move to</text>
  <text start="655.72" dur="5.73">remove the Fed well nothing&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="658.84" dur="5.58">change in this economy it will not get</text>

  <text start="734.89" dur="6.6">passed would prohibit regulations on the</text>
  <text start="739.24" dur="4.4">financial industry and eliminate laws to</text>
  <text start="741.49" dur="6.36">safeguard online or digital privacy</text>
  <text start="743.64" dur="5.95">render illegal any by local rules at any</text>
  <text start="747.85" dur="4.88">level of government effectively</text>
  <text start="749.59" dur="6.03">dismantle any public advantages to the</text>
  <text start="752.73" dur="6.7">derived from state-owned enterprises and</text>
  <text start="755.62" dur="7.62">eliminate net neutrality earlier drafts</text>
  <text start="759.43" dur="6.24">of tisa also prohibit any restrictions</text>
  <text start="763.24" dur="4.73">on the size expansion or entry of</text>
  <text start="765.67" dur="5.43">financial companies and a ban on new</text>
  <text start="767.97" dur="5.71">regulations like glass-steagall which we</text>
  <text start="771.1" dur="5.28">know that Trump wanted to reenact</text>
  <text start="773.68" dur="6.48">glass-steagall so what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="776.38" dur="7.59">right now is that tisa is doing exactly</text>
  <text start="780.16" dur="6.3">what TPP did but on steroids and we know</text>
  <text start="783.97" dur="5.55">that TPP they wanted to bring foreign</text>
  <text start="786.46" dur="5.73">workers into this country and have them</text>
  <text start="789.52" dur="4.8">work making the same wages they would be</text>
  <text start="792.19" dur="4.59">making in their country which would make</text>
  <text start="794.32" dur="6.54">it very difficult for the American</text>
  <text start="796.78" dur="7.71">worker to find jobs we also know they</text>
  <text start="800.86" dur="6.48">want to implement a corporate court</text>
  <text start="804.49" dur="4.62">system which is above the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="807.34" dur="6.21">court system which removes the</text>
  <text start="809.11" dur="6.66">sovereignty from that country this is</text>
  <text start="813.55" dur="6.06">all still in tisa they still want this</text>
  <text start="815.77" dur="7.38">now interestingly they left China out of</text>
  <text start="819.61" dur="5.55">this completely and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="823.15" dur="6.57">right now is tisa is definitely the</text>
  <text start="825.16" dur="5.67">back-up plan for TPP and we can see</text>
  <text start="829.72" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re going to be trying to push this</text>
  <text start="830.83" dur="5.49">now what is Trump going to do we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="832.99" dur="5.22">know at this point because we can see at</text>
  <text start="836.32" dur="4.56">this time that there are many things</text>
  <text start="838.21" dur="7.44">happening in the government we can see</text>
  <text start="840.88" dur="7.14">that the elite the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="845.65" dur="3.33">are pushing their agenda they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="848.02" dur="3.48">to push Trump</text>
  <text start="848.98" dur="4.469">into what they want him to do they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="851.5" dur="5.31">telling them certain things and you have</text>
  <text start="853.449" dur="6.031">to remember since you got into the White</text>
  <text start="856.81" dur="6.42">House they have been pushing their</text>
  <text start="859.48" dur="6.78">agenda to make them either obey what</text>
