  <text start="223.54" dur="5.17">5.4 percent decrease from the last month</text>
  <text start="226.85" dur="5.94">and an eight point three percent drop</text>
  <text start="228.71" dur="5.97">from September of last year now we know</text>
  <text start="232.79" dur="4.44">why this is happening we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="234.68" dur="4.74">tracking the economy we&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="237.23" dur="4.44">at the automobile industry and we knew</text>
  <text start="239.42" dur="4.05">sooner or later that everything would</text>
  <text start="241.67" dur="3.72">start to decline now of course the auto</text>
  <text start="243.47" dur="3.6">industry is out there saying the reason</text>
  <text start="245.39" dur="4.32">why this is happening is because of the</text>
  <text start="247.07" dur="4.889">tariffs no this has been on a sharp</text>
  <text start="249.71" dur="4.26">decline the whole thing was built up on</text>
  <text start="251.959" dur="4.681">an illusion they were channel stuffing</text>
  <text start="253.97" dur="6.21">bringing him subprime subprime subprime</text>
  <text start="256.64" dur="6.68">people and guess what now it&amp;#39;s time to</text>
  <text start="260.18" dur="5.88">pay the piper what&amp;#39;s happening here is</text>
  <text start="263.32" dur="4.57">everything is going to start to break</text>
  <text start="266.06" dur="3.9">down and it&amp;#39;s going to happen quicker</text>
  <text start="267.89" dur="5.55">and quicker and what we&amp;#39;re watching</text>
  <text start="269.96" dur="4.91">right now is the people&amp;#39;s economy this</text>
  <text start="273.44" dur="5.28">is the problem with the central bank</text>
  <text start="274.87" dur="6.73">they can&amp;#39;t mask what&amp;#39;s happening on the</text>
  <text start="278.72" dur="6.18">street they can mask what&amp;#39;s happening on</text>
  <text start="281.6" dur="4.92">a higher level where they say oh look at</text>
  <text start="284.9" dur="3.18">the stock market look at the GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="286.52" dur="3.21">look at the unemployment numbers look</text>
  <text start="288.08" dur="3.87">inflation look at all the numbers that</text>
  <text start="289.73" dur="3.84">we can manipulate what else could they</text>
  <text start="291.95" dur="3.21">manipulate look look we can blow up</text>
  <text start="293.57" dur="3.45">bubbles and housing we can blow up</text>
  <text start="295.16" dur="3.18">bubbles in the automobile industry we</text>
  <text start="297.02" dur="2.94">can blow bubbles in the student loan</text>
  <text start="298.34" dur="3.87">industry we can blow up bubbles</text>
  <text start="299.96" dur="5.04">everywhere eventually what happens is</text>
  <text start="302.21" dur="5.19">these bubbles pop eventually what</text>
  <text start="305" dur="4.89">happens is that manipulation is exposed</text>
  <text start="307.4" dur="4.05">and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="309.89" dur="6.02">but this is all part of the plan the</text>
  <text start="311.45" dur="8.519">plan is in motion basically the plan is</text>
  <text start="315.91" dur="5.649">pump the economy up to</text>
  <text start="319.969" dur="5.88">an economy that we&amp;#39;ve never seen before</text>
  <text start="321.559" dur="7.77">nothing can be blamed on Trump while the</text>
  <text start="325.849" dur="5.94">entire system starts to break down have</text>
  <text start="329.329" dur="5.67">the Fed raised the rates continuously</text>
  <text start="331.789" dur="6.12">and if bad news comes out maybe from the</text>
  <text start="334.999" dur="6.21">D class and if that should bring down</text>
  <text start="337.909" dur="5.19">the economy so be it and you can see</text>
  <text start="341.209" dur="4.35">this is where we are headed now</text>
  <text start="343.099" dur="4.08">in the United States we have a housing</text>
  <text start="345.559" dur="3.24">bubble in Canada there&amp;#39;s a housing</text>
  <text start="347.179" dur="5">bubble Australia there&amp;#39;s a housing</text>
  <text start="348.799" dur="6.96">bubble but the global housing bubble is</text>
  <text start="352.179" dur="5.86">is gigantic right now is grown like</text>
  <text start="355.759" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;ve never seen before now three years</text>
  <text start="358.039" dur="4.5">ago people said there&amp;#39;s no housing</text>
  <text start="360.799" dur="6.09">bubble there&amp;#39;s no problem there is</text>
  <text start="362.539" dur="6.12">absolutely nothing so UBS looked at the</text>
  <text start="366.889" dur="4.471">world&amp;#39;s most expensive housing markets</text>
  <text start="368.659" dur="3.39">three years ago it found that London and</text>
  <text start="371.36" dur="3.419">Hong Kong</text>
  <text start="372.049" dur="8.1">we&amp;#39;re the only two areas exposed to</text>
  <text start="374.779" dur="8.46">bubble risks well three years later what</text>
  <text start="380.149" dur="5.7">do we say well we see something</text>
  <text start="383.239" dur="6.24">completely different because in the</text>
  <text start="385.849" dur="7.41">latest report by UBS what do we see we</text>
  <text start="389.479" dur="6.12">see that the bubbles have grown it found</text>
  <text start="393.259" dur="5.46">that six of the world&amp;#39;s largest cities</text>
  <text start="395.599" dur="6.44">are now subject to a massive speculative</text>
  <text start="398.719" dur="7.95">housing bubbles and many others are</text>
  <text start="402.039" dur="7.51">right on the cusp of being the biggest</text>
  <text start="406.669" dur="5.25">bubbles we&amp;#39;ve ever seen now they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="409.549" dur="5.33">expanded their list and if we take a</text>
  <text start="411.919" dur="6.99">look at the list we can see Hong Kong</text>
  <text start="414.879" dur="8.2">huge munich huge toronto vancouver</text>
  <text start="418.909" dur="7.04">Amster Stan Amsterdam London gigantic</text>
  <text start="423.079" dur="6.66">housing bubbles these are the worst</text>
  <text start="425.949" dur="5.68">below this we have Stockholm Paris San</text>
  <text start="429.739" dur="6.39">Francisco Frankfurt Sydney Los Angeles</text>
  <text start="431.629" dur="7.5">Zurich Tokyo Geneva New York and this is</text>
  <text start="436.129" dur="4.44">coming from UBS and if we look at the</text>
  <text start="439.129" dur="4.01">individual cities which we&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="440.569" dur="4.89">before and Wolff Richter has done this</text>
  <text start="443.139" dur="3.61">quite often where he looked at the</text>
  <text start="445.459" dur="3.18">housing bubbles in many different cities</text>
  <text start="446.749" dur="4.56">the housing bubbles have been blown up</text>
  <text start="448.639" dur="4.921">in the 20 cities in the United States</text>
  <text start="451.309" dur="4.911">they might not be the biggest bubbles</text>
  <text start="453.56" dur="7.2">but they&amp;#39;re bigger than they were in</text>
  <text start="456.22" dur="8.53">2008 so what this is telling us is that</text>
  <text start="460.76" dur="5.64">the housing bubble is not just here in</text>
  <text start="464.75" dur="6.15">the United States it&amp;#39;s not just in</text>
  <text start="466.4" dur="7.26">Canada its global remember the world is</text>
  <text start="470.9" dur="5.01">interconnected this is how the central</text>
  <text start="473.66" dur="4.53">bank system works everything is</text>
  <text start="475.91" dur="4.17">interconnected and centralized so what</text>
  <text start="478.19" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;ve been doing is they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="480.08" dur="5.43">blowing up these bubbles everywhere it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="482.51" dur="5.04">an everywhere everything bubble that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="485.51" dur="3.87">what we see right now and when we look</text>
  <text start="487.55" dur="5.4">around the world we can see that</text>
  <text start="489.38" dur="7.289">countries are starting to break down the</text>
  <text start="492.95" dur="6.689">bubbles are going to pop once they pop</text>
  <text start="496.669" dur="5.191">it&amp;#39;s going to be a disaster scenario and</text>
  <text start="499.639" dur="4.051">we know they&amp;#39;re going to pop because</text>
  <text start="501.86" dur="5.04">throughout history they have always</text>
  <text start="503.69" dur="5.43">popped the system was designed to do</text>
  <text start="506.9" dur="5.91">this this is a central banking system it</text>
  <text start="509.12" dur="7.59">is not a people system but this plan</text>
  <text start="512.81" dur="5.49">that we keep talking about just doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="516.71" dur="3.87">have to do with the economy remember</text>
  <text start="518.3" dur="4.38">everything is connected because</text>
  <text start="520.58" dur="6.12">everything goes back to the central bank</text>
  <text start="522.68" dur="8.43">the deep state the central bank so the</text>
  <text start="526.7" dur="8.61">deep state used the creation of free</text>
  <text start="531.11" dur="5.94">money to fund their operations and of</text>
  <text start="535.31" dur="4.38">course they have dark pools of money</text>
  <text start="537.05" dur="5.82">they have the exchange Stabilization</text>
  <text start="539.69" dur="6.3">Fund they have everything that we talked</text>
  <text start="542.87" dur="5.78">about in the past and they use these</text>
  <text start="545.99" dur="5.76">funds to put pressure on other countries</text>
  <text start="548.65" dur="5.5">well this is all about to end and this</text>
  <text start="551.75" dur="5.31">is what the plan is it just doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="554.15" dur="6">to do with adi class of fisa or text</text>
  <text start="557.06" dur="7.05">messages this whole plan is to bring</text>
  <text start="560.15" dur="6.84">down the entire operation because if you</text>
  <text start="564.11" dur="4.62">just cut off the few people that were</text>
  <text start="566.99" dur="4.53">spying on Trump and things like that and</text>
  <text start="568.73" dur="6.24">if you cut off one head of the Hydra</text>
  <text start="571.52" dur="6.39">another one goes back you have to go for</text>
  <text start="574.97" dur="5.58">the body you have to destroy the entire</text>
  <text start="577.91" dur="5.28">thing and that&amp;#39;s what this plan is all</text>
  <text start="580.55" dur="6.39">about going after and getting to the</text>
  <text start="583.19" dur="7.62">root of the problem destroying the</text>
  <text start="586.94" dur="7.26">what makes it possible to fund the deep</text>
  <text start="590.81" dur="6.24">state to fund the central banking system</text>
  <text start="594.2" dur="7.38">to fund everything that we see around</text>
  <text start="597.05" dur="7.8">the world and the plan is to remove this</text>
  <text start="601.58" dur="6.12">and that&amp;#39;s what we are seeing of course</text>
  <text start="604.85" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s one step at a time you can&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="607.7" dur="4.62">go in and say okay we&amp;#39;re gonna remove</text>
  <text start="610.46" dur="4.71">all of this because remember there are</text>
  <text start="612.32" dur="5.94">still those on the other side central</text>
  <text start="615.17" dur="5.13">bankers deep state many operatives that</text>
  <text start="618.26" dur="4.29">will fight this tooth and nail so this</text>
  <text start="620.3" dur="4.2">doesn&amp;#39;t happen and that&amp;#39;s what we see</text>
  <text start="622.55" dur="5.25">happening so you have to be very</text>
  <text start="624.5" dur="6">strategic very cautious and set</text>
  <text start="627.8" dur="5.4">everything up and put everything in</text>
  <text start="630.5" dur="5.58">motion that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re watching right</text>
  <text start="633.2" dur="6.75">now and of course as Q says enjoy the</text>
  <text start="636.08" dur="6.75">show the show is putting everything in</text>
  <text start="639.95" dur="5.46">motion putting all the chess pieces in</text>
  <text start="642.83" dur="5.67">the right spot so eventually you can say</text>
  <text start="645.41" dur="5.96">check checkmate and there&amp;#39;s no way out</text>
  <text start="648.5" dur="5.58">because once you hit checkmate those</text>
  <text start="651.37" dur="5.71">people in the establishment in the</text>
  <text start="654.08" dur="6.9">central bank those people who were doing</text>
  <text start="657.08" dur="7.44">corrupt criminal activities they have no</text>
  <text start="660.98" dur="6.3">way out they&amp;#39;re stuck and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="664.52" dur="7.68">we&amp;#39;re watching right now we&amp;#39;ll these</text>
  <text start="667.28" dur="8.19">tariffs these tax plans this is for the</text>
  <text start="672.2" dur="5.76">transition transitioning us out of the</text>
  <text start="675.47" dur="5.13">central banking system this is not about</text>
  <text start="677.96" dur="4.14">taking their economy and making it</text>
  <text start="680.6" dur="3.99">better what would be the purpose in that</text>
  <text start="682.1" dur="4.02">there&amp;#39;d be no purpose in that because we</text>
  <text start="684.59" dur="4.32">would still be stuck in a central</text>
  <text start="686.12" dur="5.969">banking system a system that works on</text>
