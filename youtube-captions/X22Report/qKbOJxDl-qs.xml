  <text start="65.93" dur="4.59">economic euphoria has reached new</text>
  <text start="67.759" dur="5.4">heights when it crashes you know what</text>
  <text start="70.52" dur="5.16">happens let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="73.159" dur="4.831">collapse financial news now the euphoria</text>
  <text start="75.68" dur="3.84">in the economy well it has reached new</text>
  <text start="77.99" dur="4.26">heights people looking at the stock</text>
  <text start="79.52" dur="5.849">market and there are many individuals</text>
  <text start="82.25" dur="5.28">out there who believe that this economy</text>
  <text start="85.369" dur="4.951">is one of the best economies they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="87.53" dur="4.589">ever seen now remember there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="90.32" dur="4.439">majority of people around the country</text>
  <text start="92.119" dur="4.051">that realizing this is why they voted</text>
  <text start="94.759" dur="4.47">for Trump because they realize that</text>
  <text start="96.17" dur="6.27">there is major major problems in the</text>
  <text start="99.229" dur="4.291">economy and they didn&amp;#39;t want Clinton to</text>

  <text start="109.1" dur="3.6">this was going to happen very very</text>
  <text start="111.11" dur="4.38">quickly and I think what everyone didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="112.7" dur="5.49">realize is how entrenched the deep state</text>
  <text start="115.49" dur="5.969">was and how long and how powerful they</text>
  <text start="118.19" dur="5.76">got over the many years and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="121.459" dur="6.33">seeing through the stock market through</text>
  <text start="123.95" dur="7.89">all the fake manipulation is the ability</text>
  <text start="127.789" dur="8.851">to keep this euphoria this illusion</text>
  <text start="131.84" dur="6.66">alive for such a long time and what</text>
  <text start="136.64" dur="3.45">we&amp;#39;re starting to realize is that there</text>
  <text start="138.5" dur="3.06">are central bank&amp;#39;s there is countries</text>
  <text start="140.09" dur="3.869">that have been purchasing a lot of</text>
  <text start="141.56" dur="4.59">stocks a lot of tech stocks keeping the</text>
  <text start="143.959" dur="5.131">market up we understand that the Fed has</text>
  <text start="146.15" dur="5.339">a trading desk which is trading and</text>
  <text start="149.09" dur="4.35">pumping money into the stock market we</text>
  <text start="151.489" dur="3.511">understand that the numbers have been</text>
  <text start="153.44" dur="3.81">manipulated they go back in time they</text>
  <text start="155" dur="6">revise the numbers to make everything</text>
  <text start="157.25" dur="6.03">looked fantastic back in time and going</text>
  <text start="161" dur="3.51">forward they take the numbers and they</text>
  <text start="163.28" dur="4.41">manipulate them to make it look like</text>
  <text start="164.51" dur="6.03">things are doing well and something very</text>
  <text start="167.69" dur="4.35">interesting happened where I think a lot</text>
  <text start="170.54" dur="5.55">of people understand and realize that</text>
  <text start="172.04" dur="7.05">the internet Facebook Google they have</text>
  <text start="176.09" dur="7.11">these advertisements where people click</text>
  <text start="179.09" dur="5.909">on them and these companies they sell</text>
  <text start="183.2" dur="3.66">the advertisement they make revenue from</text>
  <text start="184.999" dur="4.951">this and a lot of companies</text>
  <text start="186.86" dur="5.82">use this and this is their main way of</text>
  <text start="189.95" dur="5.81">bringing in revenue into the company and</text>
  <text start="192.68" dur="5.31">this is how the entire company is</text>
  <text start="195.76" dur="4.69">evaluated and this is how the stocks are</text>
  <text start="197.99" dur="4.35">continually moving up and we know this</text>
  <text start="200.45" dur="3.99">for Facebook we know this for Google and</text>
  <text start="202.34" dur="3.84">some of the other companies like</text>
  <text start="204.44" dur="3.57">Instagram Instagram Twitter and many</text>
  <text start="206.18" dur="4.35">others they&amp;#39;re really not doing as well</text>
  <text start="208.01" dur="4.68">as everyone wants them everyone wants to</text>
  <text start="210.53" dur="5.42">believe that they&amp;#39;re doing but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="212.69" dur="5.55">very interesting is that this marketing</text>
  <text start="215.95" dur="5.74">individual Keith weed who&amp;#39;s the head of</text>
  <text start="218.24" dur="5.46">marketing of Unilever and he oversees a</text>
  <text start="221.69" dur="4.71">budget of about 8 billion dollars per</text>
  <text start="223.7" dur="5.49">year and what they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="226.4" dur="5.22">realize is that a lot of these</text>
  <text start="229.19" dur="6.39">advertising clicks are not in fact</text>
  <text start="231.62" dur="6.54">coming from humans about 60% are coming</text>
  <text start="235.58" dur="3.9">from bots and people you know is</text>
  <text start="238.16" dur="3.57">scratching their head saying well why</text>
  <text start="239.48" dur="4.97">does this matter well it does matter</text>
  <text start="241.73" dur="5.69">because they did a little experiment and</text>
  <text start="244.45" dur="6.49">basically what has happened here is that</text>
  <text start="247.42" dur="5.77">Procter &amp;amp; Gamble they decide you know</text>
  <text start="250.94" dur="5.34">something let&amp;#39;s cut a hundred million</text>
  <text start="253.19" dur="4.56">dollars in digital marketing and once</text>
  <text start="256.28" dur="5.78">they did this they wanted to see if</text>
  <text start="257.75" dur="6.72">there was an impact on sales impact on</text>
  <text start="262.06" dur="5.98">what has been happening with their</text>
  <text start="264.47" dur="6.93">product and they cut this and they saw</text>
  <text start="268.04" dur="6.18">zero impact on their growth it had no</text>
  <text start="271.4" dur="5.37">effect whatsoever and they started to do</text>
  <text start="274.22" dur="5.1">more experiments to figure out what was</text>
  <text start="276.77" dur="4.31">going on here and they whittled all this</text>
  <text start="279.32" dur="4.62">down and they started to realize that</text>
  <text start="281.08" dur="5.589">there&amp;#39;s clicks are not coming from</text>
  <text start="283.94" dur="4.289">humans now this is going to be a major</text>
  <text start="286.669" dur="2.761">problem going forward because a lot of</text>
  <text start="288.229" dur="5.311">people looking at the tech stocks</text>
  <text start="289.43" dur="5.88">Facebook Instagram YouTube and many</text>
  <text start="293.54" dur="4.76">others and they&amp;#39;re going to say well</text>
  <text start="295.31" dur="6.87">wait a minute are these revenues real</text>
  <text start="298.3" dur="7.45">something&amp;#39;s wrong here and if or when</text>
  <text start="302.18" dur="6.54">these corporations start to scale back</text>
  <text start="305.75" dur="5.55">their advertising this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="308.72" dur="4.8">problem and we can see that it is</text>
  <text start="311.3" dur="4.71">already starting and I&amp;#39;m not talking</text>
  <text start="313.52" dur="4.92">about the YouTube ad boycott I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="316.01" dur="4.03">about these corporations looking at</text>
  <text start="318.44" dur="3.7">Facebook looking at Twitter</text>
  <text start="320.04" dur="4.65">at Instagram and saying wait a minute</text>
  <text start="322.14" dur="5.79">what we&amp;#39;re spending here is it really</text>
  <text start="324.69" dur="5.4">worth it and they&amp;#39;re getting noticed</text>
  <text start="327.93" dur="3.81">that it really isn&amp;#39;t and this is going</text>
  <text start="330.09" dur="5.58">to be a major problem going forward</text>
  <text start="331.74" dur="6.33">because at this point if you remove 60%</text>
  <text start="335.67" dur="6.3">of these clicks what they consider our</text>
  <text start="338.07" dur="5.67">bots they&amp;#39;re left with 40% and most of</text>
  <text start="341.97" dur="4.29">these companies they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="343.74" dur="5.43">able to make it and this is going to be</text>
  <text start="346.26" dur="6.18">a major problem in the tech arena and</text>
  <text start="349.17" dur="4.92">for the stock market now when we look at</text>
  <text start="352.44" dur="3.48">the economy here in the United States</text>
  <text start="354.09" dur="4.38">what are we seeing we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="355.92" dur="4.71">illusion being kept alive now the way</text>
  <text start="358.47" dur="6.12">the illusion is kept alive is they keep</text>
  <text start="360.63" dur="6.48">everything pretty much static they make</text>
  <text start="364.59" dur="5.52">it seem like things are improving but</text>
  <text start="367.11" dur="6.3">when you manipulate when you have hedge</text>
  <text start="370.11" dur="5.46">funds investors say invest in homes they</text>
  <text start="373.41" dur="5.25">can&amp;#39;t continually do this what happens</text>
  <text start="375.57" dur="5.49">is the pending home sales the existing</text>
  <text start="378.66" dur="4.29">home sales and new home sales they go up</text>
  <text start="381.06" dur="3.66">the next month they go down the next</text>
  <text start="382.95" dur="3.63">month they go up but really when you</text>
  <text start="384.72" dur="6.09">look at it over time it&amp;#39;s really gone</text>
  <text start="386.58" dur="6.54">nowhere because in a normal free market</text>
  <text start="390.81" dur="4.56">economy where people are driving the</text>
  <text start="393.12" dur="5.34">economy and we&amp;#39;ve seen this prior to</text>
  <text start="395.37" dur="4.2">2008 everything continually moves up</text>
  <text start="398.46" dur="3.45">because there are more and more people</text>
  <text start="399.57" dur="4.64">coming into the market when you have the</text>
  <text start="401.91" dur="6.42">central bank&amp;#39;s trying to control it well</text>
  <text start="404.21" dur="6.07">they can&amp;#39;t do this in every aspect so</text>
  <text start="408.33" dur="3.42">you&amp;#39;ll see the big ups and downs but</text>
  <text start="410.28" dur="3.57">actually the economy is going nowhere</text>
  <text start="411.75" dur="3.9">the housing sales are going nowhere and</text>
  <text start="413.85" dur="4.26">pretty much everything is going nowhere</text>
  <text start="415.65" dur="5.34">and this is what we have been seeing for</text>
  <text start="418.11" dur="4.86">the last many many years especially with</text>
  <text start="420.99" dur="3.33">home sales and we know that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="422.97" dur="4.47">hedge funds and investment companies</text>
  <text start="424.32" dur="5.79">they been investing quite a bit they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="427.44" dur="5.16">been buying up homes keeping them off</text>
  <text start="430.11" dur="5.34">the market renting them if they can and</text>
  <text start="432.6" dur="4.8">we see at this point that the housing</text>
  <text start="435.45" dur="4.59">market existing home sales pending home</text>
  <text start="437.4" dur="6.69">sales new construction well it is really</text>
  <text start="440.04" dur="5.88">gone absolutely nowhere and when we look</text>
  <text start="444.09" dur="4.01">at pending home sales right now we can</text>
  <text start="445.92" dur="5.999">see the pace of home sales is now</text>
  <text start="448.1" dur="5.74">unchanged since May of 2015 now they</text>
  <text start="451.919" dur="5.851">were able to prop it up</text>
  <text start="453.84" dur="6.69">from the Great Recession and it fell a</text>
  <text start="457.77" dur="5.429">little bit but basically it&amp;#39;s been very</text>
  <text start="460.53" dur="5.19">very static and they really can&amp;#39;t get it</text>
  <text start="463.199" dur="5.541">to move anywhere and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="465.72" dur="7.199">see that there are signs that home sales</text>
  <text start="468.74" dur="6.429">retail sales manufacturing all of this</text>
  <text start="472.919" dur="4.261">is starting to give way right now now</text>
  <text start="475.169" dur="4.831">there&amp;#39;s a lot of soft data coming out</text>
  <text start="477.18" dur="4.2">and the soft data is saying that yes</text>
  <text start="480" dur="3.93">things are good I mean if we look at the</text>
  <text start="481.38" dur="4.17">Dallas Fed activity they&amp;#39;re showing an</text>
  <text start="483.93" dur="4.02">improvement now this is the soft data</text>
  <text start="485.55" dur="5.04">when we look at the hard data well the</text>
  <text start="487.95" dur="5.25">hard data is crashing so we have a</text>
  <text start="490.59" dur="5.91">complete and utter disconnect between</text>
  <text start="493.2" dur="5.88">soft data and hard data we&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="496.5" dur="5.34">seeing with the Chicago PMI it is plunge</text>
  <text start="499.08" dur="4.95">most since February 2015 to fifty eight</text>
  <text start="501.84" dur="4.62">point nine this erase all of July</text>
  <text start="504.03" dur="5.28">surprise gains as new orders growth</text>
  <text start="506.46" dur="6.24">slowed and prices paid accelerated and</text>
  <text start="509.31" dur="4.8">when we look at the economy and we look</text>
  <text start="512.7" dur="4.019">at the real stats and I&amp;#39;m looking at</text>
  <text start="514.11" dur="4.559">John Williams at shadow stats calm and</text>
  <text start="516.719" dur="4.95">he really breaks it down very nicely and</text>
  <text start="518.669" dur="4.351">how the economy is doing and if we take</text>
  <text start="521.669" dur="2.871">what the corporate media is telling us</text>
  <text start="523.02" dur="5.13">and we look at what he has been</text>
  <text start="524.54" dur="7.29">basically calculating we can see there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="528.15" dur="7.05">a huge disconnect now freight index is</text>
  <text start="531.83" dur="5.08">continued in a low level non expansion</text>
  <text start="535.2" dur="5.97">it is down by eleven point seven percent</text>
  <text start="536.91" dur="6.51">from its pre-recession peak we see motor</text>
  <text start="541.17" dur="6.03">vehicle orders and shipments they have</text>
  <text start="543.42" dur="5.97">declined in June we see home sales</text>
  <text start="547.2" dur="5.24">related construction in the second</text>
  <text start="549.39" dur="5.79">quarter of 2017 well new home sales are</text>
  <text start="552.44" dur="4.99">realistically down negative twelve point</text>
  <text start="555.18" dur="4.01">three percent existing home sales are</text>
  <text start="557.43" dur="3.87">down negative three point seven percent</text>
  <text start="559.19" dur="5.41">building permits are down negative</text>
  <text start="561.3" dur="5.27">thirteen percent housing starts are down</text>
  <text start="564.6" dur="4.41">negative twenty-one point nine percent</text>
  <text start="566.57" dur="4.209">single units are down negative seven</text>
  <text start="569.01" dur="5.16">percent multi units are down negative</text>
  <text start="570.779" dur="5.75">forty seven point three percent and what</text>
  <text start="574.17" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this huge</text>
  <text start="576.529" dur="4.481">downturn now again if you go by the Fed</text>
  <text start="579.57" dur="3.45">and the corporate media and the</text>
  <text start="581.01" dur="4.17">manipulative statistics it makes it look</text>
  <text start="583.02" dur="4.26">like everything is fine this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="585.18" dur="4.95">been keeping you foria</text>
  <text start="587.28" dur="4.92">improving and reaching new heights they</text>
  <text start="590.13" dur="5.16">they want this to happen they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="592.2" dur="5.58">this back in 2008 they did it back prior</text>
  <text start="595.29" dur="4.67">to 2001 going back throughout time</text>
  <text start="597.78" dur="5.07">because they want everyone in the market</text>
  <text start="599.96" dur="5.08">and once everyone is in the market this</text>
  <text start="602.85" dur="4.05">is when they bring it down but the</text>
  <text start="605.04" dur="3.02">actual statistics and I&amp;#39;m not talking</text>
  <text start="606.9" dur="3.66">about the double seasonally adjusted</text>
  <text start="608.06" dur="3.88">statistics the revised sophistic that</text>
  <text start="610.56" dur="3.12">they go back in time and make everything</text>
  <text start="611.94" dur="3.78">look fantastic even though it was</text>
  <text start="613.68" dur="4.8">absolutely absolutely awful we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="615.72" dur="3.96">looking at the calculations before the</text>
  <text start="618.48" dur="3.63">manipulation we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="619.68" dur="4.8">unemployment before the maybe Latian and</text>
  <text start="622.11" dur="4.83">that&amp;#39;s actually around 23% unemployment</text>
  <text start="624.48" dur="5.61">right now and what they&amp;#39;ve done over</text>
  <text start="626.94" dur="5.64">time is they&amp;#39;ve continually manipulated</text>
  <text start="630.09" dur="4.29">it very slowly to make everyone believe</text>
  <text start="632.58" dur="3.84">that it was getting better and we knew</text>
  <text start="634.38" dur="3.72">it was it making sense because when we</text>
  <text start="636.42" dur="5.72">looked at it we said okay when</text>
  <text start="638.1" dur="7.89">unemployment was at 10% we had less</text>
  <text start="642.14" dur="6.64">stores closing retail was still pretty</text>
  <text start="645.99" dur="6.54">darn good but as unemployment dropped</text>
  <text start="648.78" dur="6.03">nine eight seven percent more stores</text>
  <text start="652.53" dur="5.67">were closing retail sales were declining</text>
  <text start="654.81" dur="7.05">it didn&amp;#39;t go to online that is a myth</text>
  <text start="658.2" dur="5.91">and as we approached five percent four</text>
  <text start="661.86" dur="6.12">point seven percent this is the worst</text>
  <text start="664.11" dur="7.71">retail market we have ever seen people</text>
  <text start="667.98" dur="6.98">are saving less money and this is how</text>
  <text start="671.82" dur="6.69">you know that everything is completely</text>
  <text start="674.96" dur="6.3">manipulated because when the real world</text>

  <text start="734.83" dur="6.39">there for the balance now what&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="737.2" dur="5.639">very interesting is that the EU has a</text>

  <text start="742.839" dur="5.521">and basically this might even result in</text>
  <text start="746.02" dur="3.81">a ban of cash but what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="748.36" dur="3.81">right now and this is called the EU</text>

  <text start="766.15" dur="4.92">look at this a little bit closer they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="768.31" dur="5.49">been building this up for quite a while</text>
  <text start="771.07" dur="6.78">right now over a period of eight years</text>
  <text start="773.8" dur="8.15">and by 2023 they&amp;#39;re hoping to have quite</text>
