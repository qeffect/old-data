  <text start="140.65" dur="5.37">let&amp;#39;s talk about what is happening right</text>
  <text start="142.9" dur="6.33">now now we know that Trump has been</text>
  <text start="146.02" dur="5.79">calling out the squad pointing the</text>
  <text start="149.23" dur="5.33">finger at the squad have no lies on the</text>
  <text start="151.81" dur="4.17">squad and also pointing out certain</text>
  <text start="154.56" dur="4.22">political</text>
  <text start="155.98" dur="6.79">individuals like Cummings</text>
  <text start="158.78" dur="8.07">he&amp;#39;s pointed out Schiff he&amp;#39;s pointed out</text>
  <text start="162.77" dur="5.81">many others Pelosi and this is all part</text>
  <text start="166.85" dur="5.79">of a plan he&amp;#39;s doing this on purpose</text>
  <text start="168.58" dur="7.72">nothing is but done by coincidence now</text>
  <text start="172.64" dur="6.42">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the feds</text>
  <text start="176.3" dur="6.8">are now looking into possible campaign</text>
  <text start="179.06" dur="7.83">finance misdeeds by representative</text>
  <text start="183.1" dur="8.95">Alexandria Ocasio Cortez AOC and her</text>
  <text start="186.89" dur="10.17">chief of staff well he decided to resign</text>
  <text start="192.05" dur="10.77">on Friday which tells you something is</text>
  <text start="197.06" dur="9.56">up the hammer is about to fall on a OC</text>
  <text start="202.82" dur="7.28">and it looks like her chief of staff is</text>
  <text start="206.62" dur="6.57">getting out before it happens and</text>
  <text start="210.1" dur="5.71">there&amp;#39;s a reason why Trump continually</text>
  <text start="213.19" dur="6.519">points the finger letting everyone know</text>
  <text start="215.81" dur="6.75">what is going on here now in Baltimore</text>
  <text start="219.709" dur="6.511">we know that Trump has tweeted out that</text>
  <text start="222.56" dur="6.899">it&amp;#39;s a rat-infested city Elijah Cummings</text>
  <text start="226.22" dur="4.98">is the representative in the city of</text>
  <text start="229.459" dur="4.171">Baltimore cannot account for billions of</text>
  <text start="231.2" dur="4.53">dollars it receives in federal funding</text>
  <text start="233.63" dur="4.38">as crime drugs and rats run rampant in</text>
  <text start="235.73" dur="5.729">the city and this is according to a</text>
  <text start="238.01" dur="5.729">recent report on the city&amp;#39;s expenses now</text>
  <text start="241.459" dur="4.971">according to a 2018 audit of the city&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="243.739" dur="5.28">finance provided by usaspending.gov</text>
  <text start="246.43" dur="4.75">Baltimore received five point four four</text>
  <text start="249.019" dur="4.44">billion in federal grants contracts and</text>
  <text start="251.18" dur="3.839">other financial assistance the five</text>
  <text start="253.459" dur="3.631">point four four billion in federal</text>
  <text start="255.019" dur="4.291">grants remain unaccounted for</text>
  <text start="257.09" dur="5.31">with many of the awarded amounts shown</text>
  <text start="259.31" dur="4.85">up as zero in the audit for entries like</text>
  <text start="262.4" dur="4.19">Baltimore city&amp;#39;s mayor&amp;#39;s office</text>
  <text start="264.16" dur="4.35">Baltimore city&amp;#39;s housing police</text>
  <text start="266.59" dur="4.56">Baltimore City Health Department</text>
  <text start="268.51" dur="6.28">Baltimore City public school system and</text>
  <text start="271.15" dur="6.22">the Baltimore City auditor Andrew asked</text>
  <text start="274.79" dur="4.77">who resigned in February after rumors</text>
  <text start="277.37" dur="4.44">resurfaced that she faced pressure to</text>
  <text start="279.56" dur="4.83">write off money that was not accounted</text>
  <text start="281.81" dur="4.41">for former baltimore mayor katherine pug</text>
  <text start="284.39" dur="3.779">resigned three months later due to a</text>
  <text start="286.22" dur="3.72">growing scandal where she allegedly</text>
  <text start="288.169" dur="3.151">profited from over a hundreds of</text>
  <text start="289.94" dur="2.43">thousands of dollars from children&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="291.32" dur="2.49">books she wrote</text>
  <text start="292.37" dur="3.42">at the University of Maryland Medical</text>
  <text start="293.81" dur="6.359">system bought while she served as a</text>
  <text start="295.79" dur="7.86">board member and now everyone is looking</text>
  <text start="300.169" dur="5.761">at Baltimore and they&amp;#39;re wondering where</text>
  <text start="303.65" dur="2.97">is the five point four four billion</text>
  <text start="305.93" dur="2.84">dollars</text>
  <text start="306.62" dur="4.47">remember Trump tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="308.77" dur="4.119">Baltimore numbers are the worst in the</text>
  <text start="311.09" dur="3.78">United States on crime and the economy</text>
  <text start="312.889" dur="4.321">billions of dollars have been pumped in</text>
  <text start="314.87" dur="5.1">over the years but to no avail</text>
  <text start="317.21" dur="4.739">the money was stolen or wasted asked</text>
  <text start="319.97" dur="4.199">Elijah Cummings where it went</text>
  <text start="321.949" dur="5.431">he should investigate himself with his</text>
  <text start="324.169" dur="5.491">Oversight Committee but again Pelosi</text>
  <text start="327.38" dur="5">changed the rules of the Oversight</text>
  <text start="329.66" dur="6.479">Committee and it&amp;#39;s focused on Trump only</text>
  <text start="332.38" dur="6.88">but yet again we know where all this</text>
  <text start="336.139" dur="4.681">went this is not a coincidence it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="339.26" dur="4.11">a coincidence that Trump was pointing</text>
  <text start="340.82" dur="7.38">this out or tweeting it out it was all</text>
  <text start="343.37" dur="9.12">part of the plan now coming out of front</text>
  <text start="348.2" dur="6.48">page magazine they reported that the</text>
  <text start="352.49" dur="8.25">Hillary Clinton email investigation and</text>
  <text start="354.68" dur="7.41">coverup was assisted by the FBI now we</text>
  <text start="360.74" dur="4.02">kind of knew this from the very very</text>
  <text start="362.09" dur="5.61">beginning let me read a little bit about</text>
  <text start="364.76" dur="4.92">what has happened here in breaking news</text>

  <text start="381.289" dur="4.44">pertaining to Cheryl Mills and Heather</text>
  <text start="383.33" dur="4.89">Samuelson in the Hillary email scandal</text>
  <text start="385.729" dur="5.071">this was a stunning litigation win</text>
  <text start="388.22" dur="5.16">hard-fought after years of litigation by</text>
  <text start="390.8" dur="4.41">the ACLJ attorneys who were unable to</text>
  <text start="393.38" dur="4.2">extract the documents through the formal</text>

  <text start="432.699" dur="3.661">crafted so that the agencies could</text>
  <text start="434.65" dur="4.259">extract information from the parties</text>
  <text start="436.36" dur="4.079">despite the fact that this is not</text>
  <text start="438.909" dur="3.66">necessary because the Department of</text>
