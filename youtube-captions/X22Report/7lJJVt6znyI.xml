  <text start="56.79" dur="4.68">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.26" dur="6.57">episode 1420 bien today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.47" dur="6.06">November 8th 2017 and tada the episode</text>
  <text start="64.83" dur="6.18">is layer by layer that Kabbalah is being</text>
  <text start="67.53" dur="5.19">exposed to the world let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="71.01" dur="3.84">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="72.72" dur="6">geopolitical news now it looks like</text>
  <text start="74.85" dur="7.32">Trump is making his move to repeal the</text>
  <text start="78.72" dur="6.21">individual mandate from Obamacare now we</text>
  <text start="82.17" dur="4.02">discussed Obamacare yesterday and we</text>
  <text start="84.93" dur="4.35">know the corporate media is out there</text>
  <text start="86.19" dur="5.52">trying to convince us that the signups</text>
  <text start="89.28" dur="4.11">there just better than ever and it</text>
  <text start="91.71" dur="4.83">really makes no sense whatsoever we know</text>
  <text start="93.39" dur="5.45">that half the exchanges are bankrupt we</text>
  <text start="96.54" dur="5.939">understand the premiums are skyrocketing</text>
  <text start="98.84" dur="5.77">people are losing their jobs and we need</text>
  <text start="102.479" dur="4.861">to really dig through all these numbers</text>
  <text start="104.61" dur="5.04">and see what&amp;#39;s really going on and we</text>
  <text start="107.34" dur="4.05">know from the past that they included</text>
  <text start="109.65" dur="3.9">those individuals that have signed up</text>
  <text start="111.39" dur="6.03">before those individuals that are being</text>
  <text start="113.55" dur="5.22">subsidized and they manipulate those</text>
  <text start="117.42" dur="4.35">numbers but they never report on the</text>
  <text start="118.77" dur="5.7">people that opted out and that number is</text>
  <text start="121.77" dur="4.409">normally the same or even larger than</text>
  <text start="124.47" dur="3.81">those people who signed up before and</text>
  <text start="126.179" dur="3.991">those people who signed up before they</text>
  <text start="128.28" dur="4.05">had insurance before and all they did</text>
  <text start="130.17" dur="4.399">was move over to Obamacare so we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="132.33" dur="4.65">really seeing any big difference here</text>
  <text start="134.569" dur="4.421">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a complete</text>
  <text start="136.98" dur="5.37">breakdown because more and more insurers</text>
  <text start="138.99" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;re stepping away from Obamacare and</text>
  <text start="142.35" dur="4.17">like I said if it was so great why did</text>
  <text start="144.84" dur="2.91">the government exempt themselves they</text>
  <text start="146.52" dur="4.53">should have got rid of their crappy</text>
  <text start="147.75" dur="5.76">insurance and taken Obama care but we</text>
  <text start="151.05" dur="5.61">see right now the CBO and the CBO they</text>
  <text start="153.51" dur="6.51">you know sometimes hit it with their</text>
  <text start="156.66" dur="5.04">calculations of how well this is going</text>
  <text start="160.02" dur="3.72">to be and how well is going to work out</text>
  <text start="161.7" dur="4.47">but they came out and they&amp;#39;re supporting</text>
  <text start="163.74" dur="6.39">Trump right now saying yes we calculated</text>
  <text start="166.17" dur="4.32">the individual mandate and if we got rid</text>
  <text start="170.13" dur="3.21">of it</text>
  <text start="170.49" dur="4.35">it would save 338 billion over ten years</text>
  <text start="173.34" dur="3.96">now</text>
  <text start="174.84" dur="5.64">who cares about that what I care about</text>
  <text start="177.3" dur="6.27">is the everyday individual person where</text>
  <text start="180.48" dur="6.12">they don&amp;#39;t have to pay taxes where it</text>
  <text start="183.57" dur="4.95">will free their currency up where</text>
  <text start="186.6" dur="4.56">maybe they can pay for the rent maybe</text>
  <text start="188.52" dur="4.8">they can pay for more food or pay for</text>
  <text start="191.16" dur="5.64">whatever they need to pay for instead of</text>
  <text start="193.32" dur="5.13">it going towards taxes and we can see</text>
  <text start="196.8" dur="4.11">right now they&amp;#39;re gonna try to make a</text>
  <text start="198.45" dur="3.72">play for this and use this to try to get</text>
  <text start="200.91" dur="2.37">rid of it and I think they should get</text>
  <text start="202.17" dur="3.09">rid of it actually I think the whole</text>
  <text start="203.28" dur="5.76">thing should be scrapped and gotten rid</text>
  <text start="205.26" dur="5.73">of completely we see that the Cabal they</text>
  <text start="209.04" dur="5.07">are in big trouble right now layer by</text>
  <text start="210.99" dur="5.73">layer the Cabal is being exposed to the</text>
  <text start="214.11" dur="5.7">world and we&amp;#39;re starting to see all this</text>
  <text start="216.72" dur="5.55">information coming out I&amp;#39;m remember way</text>
  <text start="219.81" dur="4.11">back earlier this summer we saw that</text>
  <text start="222.27" dur="4.53">there was this meeting between Donald</text>
  <text start="223.92" dur="4.74">Trump jr. the Russian lawyer Natalia and</text>
  <text start="226.8" dur="3.03">they said who this is all Russian</text>
  <text start="228.66" dur="3.75">collusion and we knew this was a</text>
  <text start="229.83" dur="4.95">complete setup we knew that Clinton was</text>
  <text start="232.41" dur="4.98">all part of this we knew that the Cabal</text>
  <text start="234.78" dur="6.93">was all part of this we knew that fusion</text>
  <text start="237.39" dur="7.2">GPS was orchestrated and directed and</text>
  <text start="241.71" dur="6.32">paid by the Cabal and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="244.59" dur="6.72">starting to see right now is that</text>
  <text start="248.03" dur="5.92">according to a report hours before the</text>
  <text start="251.31" dur="3.84">lawyer Natalia sat down with Trump jr.</text>
  <text start="253.95" dur="3.39">Paul Manafort</text>
  <text start="255.15" dur="6.2">and Jared Kushner at Trump Tower on June</text>
  <text start="257.34" dur="6.03">9 2016 she was with fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="261.35" dur="4.51">co-founder and former Wall Street</text>
  <text start="263.37" dur="4.92">Journal reporter Glenn Simpson in a</text>
  <text start="265.86" dur="4.38">federal Manhattan courtroom the pair</text>
  <text start="268.29" dur="5.16">were together shortly after the Trump</text>
  <text start="270.24" dur="5.22">jr. meeting as well of course this is an</text>
  <text start="273.45" dur="3.51">intriguing new development because just</text>
  <text start="275.46" dur="5.07">a couple of months prior to these events</text>
  <text start="276.96" dur="7.11">fusion yep fusion GPS was paid at least</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="5.52">1 million by Hillary&amp;#39;s campaign and the</text>
  <text start="284.07" dur="4.08">DNC to prove that Trump was working with</text>
  <text start="286.05" dur="5.04">the Russians all of which would begs the</text>
  <text start="288.15" dur="6.03">obvious question was the whole Trump jr.</text>
  <text start="291.09" dur="8.01">Fiasco nothing more than a failed</text>
  <text start="294.18" dur="8.28">attempt to sabotage the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="299.1" dur="7.59">to make it look like there was Russian</text>
  <text start="302.46" dur="7.53">collusion to make sure that Hillary won</text>
  <text start="306.69" dur="5.7">the presidency and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="309.99" dur="4.11">this was all about and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="312.39" dur="5.31">see that this is all starting to fall</text>
  <text start="314.1" dur="6.03">apart completely now not only were</text>
  <text start="317.7" dur="2.7">Simpson and the lawyer the Russian</text>
  <text start="320.13" dur="2.34">lawyer</text>
  <text start="320.4" dur="5.82">Natalia together before the Trump jr.</text>
  <text start="322.47" dur="6.539">meeting as it turns out fusion GPS was</text>
  <text start="326.22" dur="6.3">hired by the Baker Hostetler to</text>
  <text start="329.009" dur="6.111">represent Russian firm prevas on in an</text>
  <text start="332.52" dur="5.61">asset forfeiture case a firm which</text>
  <text start="335.12" dur="5.079">Russian lawyer Natalia also represented</text>
  <text start="338.13" dur="3.629">it and was the reason that she was in</text>
  <text start="340.199" dur="5.101">the US in the first place now to</text>
  <text start="341.759" dur="5.071">summarize fusion GPS and the lawyer of</text>
  <text start="345.3" dur="3.36">the Russian lawyer Natalia were</text>
  <text start="346.83" dur="4.05">effectively coworkers</text>
  <text start="348.66" dur="4.89">defending a Putin linked Russian</text>
  <text start="350.88" dur="5.64">operative on trial in the US for a</text>
  <text start="353.55" dur="6.27">massive 230 million money laundering</text>
  <text start="356.52" dur="5.94">fraud and we could see right now this</text>
  <text start="359.82" dur="5.28">whole thing where they&amp;#39;re trying to show</text>
  <text start="362.46" dur="5.22">Russian collusion well it&amp;#39;s falling</text>
  <text start="365.1" dur="4.59">apart because we&amp;#39;re seeing that this was</text>
  <text start="367.68" dur="3.989">all paid for that they were dealing with</text>
  <text start="369.69" dur="4.349">the Russians they work with the Russians</text>
  <text start="371.669" dur="5.041">with the uranium one deal john mccain</text>
  <text start="374.039" dur="5.551">knew about it and it&amp;#39;s all starting to</text>
  <text start="376.71" dur="4.799">come out and fall apart and of course</text>
  <text start="379.59" dur="4.169">the corporate media they&amp;#39;re staying away</text>
  <text start="381.509" dur="4.081">from it they don&amp;#39;t want to really report</text>
  <text start="383.759" dur="4.111">on it but eventually what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="385.59" dur="3.449">happen is that all this information is</text>
  <text start="387.87" dur="3.299">gonna come out and we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot</text>
  <text start="389.039" dur="4.31">more information come out now we know</text>
  <text start="391.169" dur="5.641">that the cabal has been trying to</text>
  <text start="393.349" dur="6.491">control free speech which if you control</text>
  <text start="396.81" dur="5.669">it it&amp;#39;s not really free speech political</text>
  <text start="399.84" dur="4.47">correctness is a form of control and</text>
  <text start="402.479" dur="3.451">they were trying to control it with hate</text>
  <text start="404.31" dur="4.68">speech because they wanted to tell you</text>
  <text start="405.93" dur="5.82">what hate speech was they were going to</text>
  <text start="408.99" dur="5.85">define it for you so this way they can</text>
  <text start="411.75" dur="6.449">control it so we see the Cato Institute</text>
  <text start="414.84" dur="5.81">they did a 20-17 free speech and</text>
  <text start="418.199" dur="5.431">tolerance survey and they found</text>
  <text start="420.65" dur="4.9">something very interesting that the</text>
  <text start="423.63" dur="4.14">overwhelming majority eighty-two percent</text>
  <text start="425.55" dur="4.95">of Americans agree that it would be hard</text>
  <text start="427.77" dur="5.28">to ban hate speech because people can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="430.5" dur="5.9">agree what hate speech is which hate</text>
  <text start="433.05" dur="7.02">speech is hateful seventeen percent</text>
  <text start="436.4" dur="6.31">disagree with this and they did this</text>
  <text start="440.07" dur="4.68">across many different cities many</text>
  <text start="442.71" dur="5.61">different individuals you know Democrats</text>
  <text start="444.75" dur="6.93">Republicans and once again this is the</text>
  <text start="448.32" dur="5.63">problem with controlling free speech and</text>
  <text start="451.68" dur="4.37">saying oh that&amp;#39;s hateful</text>
  <text start="453.95" dur="3.93">political correctness because everyone</text>
  <text start="456.05" dur="4.74">has a different definition and we</text>
  <text start="457.88" dur="5.61">discussed this before because you cannot</text>
  <text start="460.79" dur="4.47">just say that&amp;#39;s hate speech because to</text>
  <text start="463.49" dur="6.06">one group it&amp;#39;s not really hate to</text>
  <text start="465.26" dur="6.63">another group it is for example they</text>
  <text start="469.55" dur="4.59">said how do Americans define hate speech</text>
  <text start="471.89" dur="5.52">when presented with specific statements</text>
  <text start="474.14" dur="6.69">and ideas Americans can&amp;#39;t agree on what</text>
  <text start="477.41" dur="6.69">hate speech is what&amp;#39;s offensive what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="480.83" dur="5.37">hateful now for instance a majority of</text>
  <text start="484.1" dur="4.71">Democrats 52% believe saying that</text>
  <text start="486.2" dur="5.34">transgender people have a mental</text>
  <text start="488.81" dur="4.97">disorder is hate speech only 17% of</text>
  <text start="491.54" dur="4.8">Republicans are great on the other hand</text>
  <text start="493.78" dur="4.99">42% of Republicans believe it&amp;#39;s hateful</text>
  <text start="496.34" dur="6.09">to say that police are racist while only</text>
  <text start="498.77" dur="6">90% of Democrats agree and this goes on</text>
  <text start="502.43" dur="4.5">and on and on and on this is why when we</text>
  <text start="504.77" dur="6.09">talk about freedom of speech it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.93" dur="6.9">freedom of all speech you can say</text>
  <text start="510.86" dur="5.61">whatever you want it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="513.83" dur="3.69">people have to agree with you and if you</text>
  <text start="516.47" dur="4.23">don&amp;#39;t agree with it</text>
  <text start="517.52" dur="5.459">don&amp;#39;t listen it&amp;#39;s as simple as that</text>
  <text start="520.7" dur="4.95">and this is why the founding fathers</text>
  <text start="522.979" dur="5.011">never designated well this is hateful</text>
  <text start="525.65" dur="4.35">you can&amp;#39;t say this this is political</text>
  <text start="527.99" dur="6.42">correctness this is why it says freedom</text>
  <text start="530" dur="6.9">of speech freedom of the press it</text>
  <text start="534.41" dur="4.77">doesn&amp;#39;t say the corporate media press it</text>
  <text start="536.9" dur="4.89">doesn&amp;#39;t say the alternative media press</text>
  <text start="539.18" dur="5.19">it says freedom of the press and it</text>
  <text start="541.79" dur="5.1">doesn&amp;#39;t say you have to be certified to</text>
  <text start="544.37" dur="7.16">write something down and say this is</text>
  <text start="546.89" dur="10.26">newsworthy let the people make their own</text>
  <text start="551.53" dur="7.69">choice people can look at it and say you</text>
  <text start="557.15" dur="3.99">know something I&amp;#39;m gonna check this out</text>
  <text start="559.22" dur="3.24">I don&amp;#39;t believe this is true you know</text>
  <text start="561.14" dur="2.79">something I don&amp;#39;t like what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="562.46" dur="3.57">saying so I&amp;#39;m not gonna listen anymore</text>
  <text start="563.93" dur="5.31">oh I like what you&amp;#39;re saying so I am</text>
  <text start="566.03" dur="6.3">going to listen and this is why this</text>
  <text start="569.24" dur="5.43">agenda of hate speech political</text>
  <text start="572.33" dur="4.62">correctness is all going to fall apart</text>
  <text start="574.67" dur="3.03">and actually if you ever saw or read the</text>
  <text start="576.95" dur="3.54">book The Giver</text>
  <text start="577.7" dur="5.1">they use precision of language where</text>
  <text start="580.49" dur="4.44">they kind of change the meanings of</text>
  <text start="582.8" dur="4.53">words and they took out words you</text>
  <text start="584.93" dur="2.89">weren&amp;#39;t allowed to use and people really</text>
  <text start="587.33" dur="4.15">didn&amp;#39;t under</text>
  <text start="587.82" dur="5.97">stand what they were doing and they used</text>
  <text start="591.48" dur="3.78">different words to describe it so it</text>
  <text start="593.79" dur="3.42">kind of confused all these people in</text>
  <text start="595.26" dur="3.45">over generation over generation they had</text>
  <text start="597.21" dur="3.12">no idea that they were like killing</text>
  <text start="598.71" dur="3.63">babies they said they were putting them</text>
  <text start="600.33" dur="4.44">to sleep they didn&amp;#39;t realize it was</text>
  <text start="602.34" dur="4.65">murder and this is what they wanted to</text>
  <text start="604.77" dur="5.07">do here in the United States they wanted</text>
  <text start="606.99" dur="6.56">to confuse everyone and control how</text>
  <text start="609.84" dur="6.09">people thought what people said and</text>
  <text start="613.55" dur="4.72">right now we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="615.93" dur="5.16">falling apart we see the EU they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="618.27" dur="5.07">going to impose arms embargo on</text>
  <text start="621.09" dur="3.69">Venezuela and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="623.34" dur="3.21">laying up the basis for sanctions are</text>
  <text start="624.78" dur="4.23">gonna join the u.s. where they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="626.55" dur="4.86">to sanction Venezuela now will this work</text>
  <text start="629.01" dur="4.62">most likely not because Venezuela is now</text>
  <text start="631.41" dur="4.71">shifting moving away from the dollar</text>
  <text start="633.63" dur="5.13">moving away from the euro moving towards</text>
  <text start="636.12" dur="5.16">the yuan and once they fully go on to</text>
  <text start="638.76" dur="5.13">the yuyuan use the ruble make deals with</text>
  <text start="641.28" dur="5.46">China and Russia these sanctions are not</text>
  <text start="643.89" dur="5.55">going to work whatsoever we see right</text>
  <text start="646.74" dur="4.53">now US defense secretary Jim mattis has</text>
  <text start="649.44" dur="3.87">arrived at NATO&amp;#39;s or Brussels</text>
  <text start="651.27" dur="4.68">headquarters because they are discussing</text>
  <text start="653.31" dur="3.96">what they&amp;#39;re going to do in the Middle</text>
  <text start="655.95" dur="4.92">East because what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="657.27" dur="5.82">is that Russia and Syria the Iraqi armed</text>
  <text start="660.87" dur="4.19">forces they have removed the Islamic</text>
  <text start="663.09" dur="4.77">state and it&amp;#39;s a matter of weeks and</text>
  <text start="665.06" dur="4.69">before you know it they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="667.86" dur="6.21">asked to leave and now they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="669.75" dur="8.1">okay how or what do we do at this point</text>
  <text start="674.07" dur="5.88">and they&amp;#39;re meeting with NATO to discuss</text>
  <text start="677.85" dur="4.65">how they&amp;#39;re going to remove themselves</text>
  <text start="679.95" dur="5.37">from the situation eyes and I do believe</text>
  <text start="682.5" dur="4.23">that Russia and Syria they&amp;#39;re gonna come</text>
  <text start="685.32" dur="3.36">out and Iraq is gonna come out and say</text>
  <text start="686.73" dur="4.14">listen we don&amp;#39;t need the US troops here</text>
  <text start="688.68" dur="3.99">anymore they need to leave and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="690.87" dur="5.1">gonna have to see how the u.s. responds</text>
  <text start="692.67" dur="5.82">at that time we see Russia is boosting</text>
  <text start="695.97" dur="4.65">trade with Japan right now trade between</text>
  <text start="698.49" dur="3.87">Russia and Japan asserts 17 percent in</text>
  <text start="700.62" dur="6.3">the first eight months of the year and</text>
  <text start="702.36" dur="7.32">the beginning of 2016 to the end of 2016</text>
  <text start="706.92" dur="4.62">trade was pretty darn bad but it looks</text>
  <text start="709.68" dur="3.03">like things are really picking up Japan</text>
  <text start="711.54" dur="3.54">and Russia are becoming closer and</text>
  <text start="712.71" dur="4.65">closer Moscow has also suggested to</text>
  <text start="715.08" dur="6.54">building a road and rail bridge from</text>
  <text start="717.36" dur="7.08">Russia to Japan and this would enter</text>
  <text start="721.62" dur="5.28">linked the one belt one road system so</text>
  <text start="724.44" dur="5.19">we can see that they&amp;#39;re all prepping for</text>
  <text start="726.9" dur="4.68">the belt land road and there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="729.63" dur="4.14">be trade all throughout Europe all</text>
  <text start="731.58" dur="6.09">throughout Asia all throughout Africa</text>
  <text start="733.77" dur="5.49">leading into South America and maybe the</text>
  <text start="737.67" dur="4.44">u.s. we&amp;#39;ll have to see how that plays</text>
  <text start="739.26" dur="4.11">out we see out in Ukraine Ukraine has</text>
  <text start="742.11" dur="3.69">canceled their arms agreement with</text>
  <text start="743.37" dur="4.98">Russia and we see right now that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="745.8" dur="4.2">not going to accept any arms or parts or</text>
  <text start="748.35" dur="3.51">anything from Russia it has been</text>
  <text start="750" dur="6.24">completely canceled and the UN is</text>
  <text start="751.86" dur="5.79">warning of a chlorine gas disaster in</text>
  <text start="756.24" dur="2.94">Ukraine because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="757.65" dur="4.29">now is that the fighting between the</text>
  <text start="759.18" dur="4.95">southeastern people and the Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="761.94" dur="5.19">troops has intensified near water</text>

  <text start="767.13" dur="4.44">supplies in the dawn ends region as</text>
  <text start="768.99" dur="5.25">winter approaches and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="771.57" dur="5.97">saying is that there are chlorine gas</text>
  <text start="774.24" dur="5.91">tanks in this area and if they get hit</text>
  <text start="777.54" dur="5.4">or something happens we can see that</text>
  <text start="780.15" dur="4.89">within 200 meters these individuals</text>
  <text start="782.94" dur="3.87">might receive fatal doses of the poison</text>
  <text start="785.04" dur="3.77">gas and they&amp;#39;re very concerned about</text>
  <text start="786.81" dur="4.74">this and we can see things are really</text>
  <text start="788.81" dur="4.18">starting to flare up in this area</text>
  <text start="791.55" dur="4.05">because you have to remember the Cabal</text>
  <text start="792.99" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re not satisfied in what is</text>
  <text start="795.6" dur="3.39">happening here because they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="796.74" dur="4.95">ground in all different areas and they</text>
  <text start="798.99" dur="4.8">need to have something started here and</text>
  <text start="801.69" dur="6.149">they&amp;#39;re trying as hard as they possibly</text>
  <text start="803.79" dur="6.51">can to have things pushed to make sure</text>
  <text start="807.839" dur="4.921">that their agenda is achieve their goal</text>
  <text start="810.3" dur="4.86">is achieved by having war and it looks</text>
  <text start="812.76" dur="5.82">like it is not happening at all we see</text>
  <text start="815.16" dur="6.6">out in Yemen well it looks like the</text>
  <text start="818.58" dur="6.629">sound e Saudi forces they have ended the</text>
  <text start="821.76" dur="5.79">blockade on Yemen&amp;#39;s port of Aden now</text>
  <text start="825.209" dur="4.5">does this mean the war is over no but it</text>
  <text start="827.55" dur="5.34">might be a sign that Saudi might be</text>
  <text start="829.709" dur="5.461">pulling back or this might be a decoy</text>
  <text start="832.89" dur="4.59">designed to send in an insincere message</text>
  <text start="835.17" dur="4.83">to the wider world that the conflict is</text>
  <text start="837.48" dur="4.979">widened and winding down and all of a</text>
  <text start="840" dur="3.9">sudden they spring something on the</text>
  <text start="842.459" dur="3.811">Yemeni forces and the Yemeni people</text>
  <text start="843.9" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;ve seen this before so this is</text>
  <text start="846.27" dur="3.569">something that we have to watch but the</text>
  <text start="847.5" dur="5.97">blockade has been lifted and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="849.839" dur="5.131">see a lot of aid come in to Yemen</text>
  <text start="853.47" dur="4.95">because the people there are</text>
  <text start="854.97" dur="5.369">only suffering we see that the Syrian</text>

  <text start="865.35" dur="5.13">they found there were suicide vests and</text>
  <text start="868.23" dur="4.229">they found him on dead militants and</text>
  <text start="870.48" dur="4.68">they were explaining what they used</text>

  <text start="875.16" dur="4.89">Brigadier General the tactics the</text>
  <text start="877.829" dur="5.76">terrorists used was a deploy so-called</text>
  <text start="880.05" dur="5.849">suicide units and they wear these vests</text>
  <text start="883.589" dur="5.43">and they try to cause as much damage as</text>
  <text start="885.899" dur="5.761">possible in different areas and they</text>
  <text start="889.019" dur="4.8">just blew themselves up and this is very</text>
  <text start="891.66" dur="5.369">interesting because these are the paid</text>
  <text start="893.819" dur="5.88">mercenaries and they also took these</text>
  <text start="897.029" dur="5.55">vests and put it on people and blew them</text>
  <text start="899.699" dur="5.19">up and we could see right now that this</text>
  <text start="902.579" dur="5.101">was part of the United States the the</text>
  <text start="904.889" dur="4.771">Cabal the paid mercenaries Israel the</text>
  <text start="907.68" dur="5.73">coalition forces they use these</text>
  <text start="909.66" dur="6.45">individuals and they forced individuals</text>

  <text start="916.11" dur="6.57">throughout all these different towns</text>
  <text start="918.329" dur="6.901">cities and villages we see the OPCW the</text>
  <text start="922.68" dur="4.349">UN investigation they&amp;#39;re out with their</text>
  <text start="925.23" dur="4.529">report and they&amp;#39;re saying that yes Syria</text>
  <text start="927.029" dur="4.651">they use chemical weapons and Russia is</text>
  <text start="929.759" dur="4.89">out there saying yet this doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="931.68" dur="6.06">any sense whatsoever now remember the UN</text>
  <text start="934.649" dur="6.48">didn&amp;#39;t actually have investigators go to</text>
  <text start="937.74" dur="6.409">the site you know that entire site that</text>
  <text start="941.129" dur="5.25">was staged at the time where they showed</text>
  <text start="944.149" dur="5.081">individuals not wearing masks wearing</text>
  <text start="946.379" dur="5.7">cotton gloves showing people getting hit</text>
  <text start="949.23" dur="5.669">with sarin and the whole thing was the</text>
  <text start="952.079" dur="4.891">bunk now nikki Haley she was out there</text>
  <text start="954.899" dur="3.63">and she&amp;#39;s saying look at the children</text>
  <text start="956.97" dur="3.719">look at the people that got caught in</text>
  <text start="958.529" dur="5.16">this look at the sick people but once</text>
  <text start="960.689" dur="5.911">again that is not proof that just</text>
  <text start="963.689" dur="5.58">showing the aftermath and russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="966.6" dur="4.739">saying this whole thing makes no sense</text>
  <text start="969.269" dur="6.151">there was no investigative team they</text>
  <text start="971.339" dur="6.151">took the militants investigation they</text>
  <text start="975.42" dur="5.43">use that they use the white helmets</text>
  <text start="977.49" dur="6.269">investigation and the UN never sent</text>
  <text start="980.85" dur="5.339">individuals to the site now other</text>
  <text start="983.759" dur="4.05">individuals are looking at this and they</text>
  <text start="986.189" dur="2.7">are looking at the explosion on the</text>
  <text start="987.809" dur="2.82">street</text>
  <text start="988.889" dur="4.2">saying that the shell obliteration</text>
  <text start="990.629" dur="6.06">suggests high explosive ammunition</text>
  <text start="993.089" dur="6.3">designed not conducive with a chemical</text>
  <text start="996.689" dur="4.89">payload and once again we had a</text>
  <text start="999.389" dur="5.79">professor look at this said the same</text>
  <text start="1001.579" dur="7.17">exact thing and of course the u.s. the</text>
  <text start="1005.179" dur="6.361">Cabal is trying to use the same exact</text>
  <text start="1008.749" dur="6.81">tactic trying to use this report and</text>
  <text start="1011.54" dur="7.609">it&amp;#39;s just not going to work it&amp;#39;s a dead</text>
  <text start="1015.559" dur="7.14">end we see that the Syrian opposition</text>
  <text start="1019.149" dur="5.591">had a lot more motive to use chemical</text>
  <text start="1022.699" dur="4.98">weapons and chemical attacks on the</text>
  <text start="1024.74" dur="6">people of Syria on the Syrian forces</text>
  <text start="1027.679" dur="4.681">then the government of Syria to use it</text>
  <text start="1030.74" dur="5.099">on the own their own people now think</text>
  <text start="1032.36" dur="5.849">about this why would Assad if the people</text>
  <text start="1035.839" dur="4.83">are supporting Assad he&amp;#39;s bringing in</text>
  <text start="1038.209" dur="6.57">Russia why would he use chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="1040.669" dur="5.64">on his own people it makes no sense the</text>
  <text start="1044.779" dur="4.441">whole story doesn&amp;#39;t make sense it would</text>
  <text start="1046.309" dur="6.691">be like George Washington turning around</text>
  <text start="1049.22" dur="6.03">and firing on his own people or using</text>
  <text start="1053" dur="4.26">gas on his own people than going and</text>
  <text start="1055.25" dur="4.139">fighting the terrorists it makes no</text>
  <text start="1057.26" dur="3.96">sense it makes more sense if the</text>
  <text start="1059.389" dur="3.961">terrorists were using the chemical</text>
  <text start="1061.22" dur="6.47">weapons on the people and using it on</text>
  <text start="1063.35" dur="7.26">the forces of George Washington and</text>
  <text start="1067.69" dur="5.199">again this story has never made any</text>
  <text start="1070.61" dur="4.47">sense but they were trying to push it to</text>
  <text start="1072.889" dur="4.621">make it look like Assad was this evil</text>
  <text start="1075.08" dur="4.559">individual where he&amp;#39;s using this on his</text>
  <text start="1077.51" dur="5.039">own people but the people elected him</text>
  <text start="1079.639" dur="4.861">the people supported him the people all</text>
  <text start="1082.549" dur="4.38">the refugees are coming back into Syria</text>
  <text start="1084.5" dur="4.47">so if he was so terrible and he was</text>
  <text start="1086.929" dur="5.421">torturing using chemical weapons on all</text>
  <text start="1088.97" dur="6.929">these people why have 1.6 million people</text>
  <text start="1092.35" dur="5.62">returned to Syria they would just stayed</text>
  <text start="1095.899" dur="4.89">out of Syria but it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="1097.97" dur="6.48">because the whole thing was propaganda</text>
  <text start="1100.789" dur="5.551">once again we see that the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="1104.45" dur="4.199">hackers most likely intelligence</text>
  <text start="1106.34" dur="5.429">community Mossad and the rest have been</text>
