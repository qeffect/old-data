  <text start="133.23" dur="3.839">discuss this a little bit later in this</text>
  <text start="134.79" dur="3.6">report but first we need to understand</text>
  <text start="137.069" dur="3.601">them I&amp;#39;ve said this many many times</text>
  <text start="138.39" dur="4.86">before there are two economies right now</text>
  <text start="140.67" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;re in a central bank economy which is</text>
  <text start="143.25" dur="3.81">imploding this is what the mainstream</text>
  <text start="145.26" dur="3.479">media is talking about this is when they</text>
  <text start="147.06" dur="5.37">say oh look we&amp;#39;re heading towards a</text>
  <text start="148.739" dur="6.811">recession remember they knew prior to</text>
  <text start="152.43" dur="4.949">Trump being in office this was going to</text>
  <text start="155.55" dur="4.26">be the direction of where the economy</text>
  <text start="157.379" dur="4.44">was headed it was going to collapse</text>
  <text start="159.81" dur="4.44">under the weight of debt</text>
  <text start="161.819" dur="5.041">they had plans in place they were going</text>
  <text start="164.25" dur="4.59">to cover it up with an event and they</text>
  <text start="166.86" dur="7.019">know that everything that we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="168.84" dur="7.44">now it&amp;#39;s all statistical magic to make</text>
  <text start="173.879" dur="4.711">us think that everything is great</text>
  <text start="176.28" dur="4.53">Trump is using all these weapons against</text>
  <text start="178.59" dur="5.67">them they can&amp;#39;t say a word they cannot</text>
  <text start="180.81" dur="6.39">say hey this isn&amp;#39;t real because it would</text>
  <text start="184.26" dur="5.399">expose them Trump and the Patriots they</text>
  <text start="187.2" dur="5.879">know this and if you look at the central</text>
  <text start="189.659" dur="7.231">bank economy it is imploding on itself</text>
  <text start="193.079" dur="7.41">now remember going back in time the</text>
  <text start="196.89" dur="5.76">dollar has been losing value ever since</text>
  <text start="200.489" dur="5.64">we came off the gold standard it has</text>
  <text start="202.65" dur="5.79">accelerated to the downside which means</text>
  <text start="206.129" dur="5.61">that your dollars don&amp;#39;t go that far</text>
  <text start="208.44" dur="6.079">which means you need to depend on credit</text>
  <text start="211.739" dur="6.181">this makes up the difference and people</text>
  <text start="214.519" dur="5.711">started to use credit cards think about</text>
  <text start="217.92" dur="4.439">it in the 60s it was like gas cards in</text>
  <text start="220.23" dur="4.02">the 70s all of a sudden you saw a master</text>
  <text start="222.359" dur="4.801">charge it wasn&amp;#39;t called MasterCard and</text>
  <text start="224.25" dur="4.65">they were promoting that and then we</text>
  <text start="227.16" dur="3.24">went further than that and all of a</text>
  <text start="228.9" dur="2.94">sudden became MasterCard and Visa and</text>
  <text start="230.4" dur="3.059">then you have discover American Express</text>
  <text start="231.84" dur="6.119">and the rest because they needed</text>
  <text start="233.459" dur="7.65">something to help with the situation now</text>
  <text start="237.959" dur="5.25">think about it if there was no credit if</text>
  <text start="241.109" dur="5.071">you didn&amp;#39;t have a credit card and you</text>
  <text start="243.209" dur="5.37">went out and you tried to live on what</text>
  <text start="246.18" dur="2.97">you&amp;#39;re making and every single year</text>
  <text start="248.579" dur="2.851">passed</text>
  <text start="249.15" dur="4.11">what would you notice you would notice</text>
  <text start="251.43" dur="4.199">that you couldn&amp;#39;t survive you would</text>
  <text start="253.26" dur="4.86">notice that wow I don&amp;#39;t have enough</text>
  <text start="255.629" dur="5.79">money to pay for anything how am I going</text>
  <text start="258.12" dur="5.19">to do this this is why they needed to</text>
  <text start="261.419" dur="4.861">introduce this this was part of the plan</text>
  <text start="263.31" dur="5.25">now we know the Fed they are now</text>
  <text start="266.28" dur="5.58">lowering their rates but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="268.56" dur="6.12">interesting is with charge cards rates</text>
  <text start="271.86" dur="5.88">are continually moving up they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="274.68" dur="6.09">headed in the opposite direction banks</text>
  <text start="277.74" dur="4.709">they need this they need the interest on</text>
  <text start="280.77" dur="5.22">charge cards is where they make a lot of</text>
  <text start="282.449" dur="6.041">their money and also it keeps control of</text>
  <text start="285.99" dur="5.41">the people</text>
  <text start="288.49" dur="6.75">soon what we need to see happen is we</text>
  <text start="291.4" dur="8.21">need to get rid of all this we need to</text>
  <text start="295.24" dur="7.14">wipe this completely out and if we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="299.61" dur="4.809">we&amp;#39;re going to be in a lot of trouble</text>
  <text start="302.38" dur="3.95">and I do believe this is where Trump of</text>
  <text start="304.419" dur="6.15">the Patriots this is where we are headed</text>
  <text start="306.33" dur="6.82">now the Fed and banks they are preparing</text>
  <text start="310.569" dur="4.951">the narrative of why they need to start</text>
  <text start="313.15" dur="2.85">stimulus now think about this for a</text>
  <text start="315.52" dur="2.519">second</text>
  <text start="316" dur="7.949">and let&amp;#39;s go back a little bit in time</text>
  <text start="318.039" dur="7.321">here if we go back to 2016 and we take a</text>
  <text start="323.949" dur="2.821">look at what the Fed was saying back</text>
  <text start="325.36" dur="3.239">then and this is the reason why they</text>
  <text start="326.77" dur="3.299">were raising rates this is the reason</text>
  <text start="328.599" dur="4.021">that they were tightening they were</text>
  <text start="330.069" dur="5.07">looking at all the statistical numbers</text>
  <text start="332.62" dur="4.859">GDP unemployment and flay everything you</text>
  <text start="335.139" dur="4.261">know and they said listen the economy is</text>
  <text start="337.479" dur="5.31">getting stronger we can start tightening</text>
  <text start="339.4" dur="6.06">we can start raising rates and we are</text>
  <text start="342.789" dur="4.53">data dependent well if you go back in</text>
  <text start="345.46" dur="7.41">time and you look at the quarterly GDP</text>
  <text start="347.319" dur="10.771">of 2016 it was to 2.2 1.9 2.0 if you go</text>
  <text start="352.87" dur="8.549">to 2017 it was 3.5 3.2 2.2 2.3 and go to</text>
  <text start="358.09" dur="7.879">2018 a little bit lower 1.1 then a came</text>
  <text start="361.419" dur="8.941">right back up 2.9 3.5 2.5 you go to 2019</text>
  <text start="365.969" dur="11.281">2.1 and we&amp;#39;re looking at maybe 3.1</text>
  <text start="370.36" dur="10.799">percent for the first quarter of 2019 so</text>
  <text start="377.25" dur="7.15">everything has gotten better when you</text>
  <text start="381.159" dur="6">look at the GDP numbers and in the</text>
  <text start="384.4" dur="4.739">beginning stages the Fed said oh well</text>
  <text start="387.159" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;re tightening and we are raising</text>
  <text start="389.139" dur="4.171">rates because the economy is very strong</text>
  <text start="390.969" dur="4.651">well the economy got stronger actual if</text>
  <text start="393.31" dur="5.94">you look at unemployment and we go back</text>
  <text start="395.62" dur="5.789">to 2016 we&amp;#39;re at 5% or so a little bit</text>
  <text start="399.25" dur="7.56">below there like 4.9 and then you fast</text>
  <text start="401.409" dur="7.35">forward to 2017 we&amp;#39;re at like 4.5% go to</text>
  <text start="406.81" dur="4.38">2018 we&amp;#39;re at like four point one</text>
  <text start="408.759" dur="4.201">percent you go to today where are we</text>
  <text start="411.19" dur="4.31">three point seven percent so</text>
  <text start="412.96" dur="5.49">unemployment has gotten stronger and</text>
  <text start="415.5" dur="7.54">what is the Fed doing</text>
  <text start="418.45" dur="6.87">the Fed in 2019 reverse course when the</text>
  <text start="423.04" dur="5.49">economy was stronger than ever</text>
  <text start="425.32" dur="4.83">statistically of course does this make</text>
  <text start="428.53" dur="7.32">any sense in what they&amp;#39;re doing right</text>
  <text start="430.15" dur="9.6">now that they&amp;#39;re beginning to cut rates</text>
  <text start="435.85" dur="6.09">and they&amp;#39;re going to start stimulus no</text>
  <text start="439.75" dur="3.08">of course it doesn&amp;#39;t this makes no sense</text>
  <text start="441.94" dur="4.89">whatsoever</text>
  <text start="442.83" dur="7.06">what does this tell us this tells us</text>
  <text start="446.83" dur="6.99">that we were in an aleut and we still</text>
  <text start="449.89" dur="5.46">are in an illusionary economy created by</text>
  <text start="453.82" dur="3.3">the central bank created by the</text>
  <text start="455.35" dur="5.52">mainstream media created by the deep</text>
  <text start="457.12" dur="7.05">state if the Fed was going to follow</text>
  <text start="460.87" dur="5.13">what they were saying back in 2016 they</text>
  <text start="464.17" dur="5.85">would continue to tighten and continue</text>
  <text start="466" dur="6.51">to raise rates this was their plan to</text>
  <text start="470.02" dur="4.92">crash the system and use an event to</text>
  <text start="472.51" dur="4.53">explain why the global economy failed</text>
  <text start="474.94" dur="5.34">remember they never thought she was</text>
  <text start="477.04" dur="4.59">going to lose nelson&amp;#39;s Trump won their</text>
  <text start="480.28" dur="4.74">plan went out the window</text>
  <text start="481.63" dur="7.86">Trump came in with the Patriots and took</text>
  <text start="485.02" dur="8.99">control of everything and all of a</text>
  <text start="489.49" dur="6.51">sudden the Fed has now reversed course</text>
  <text start="494.01" dur="4.93">remember when Trump started to</text>
  <text start="496" dur="4.83">contradict the Fed he put the spotlight</text>
  <text start="498.94" dur="3.27">on them remember the central bank</text>
  <text start="500.83" dur="3.63">doesn&amp;#39;t like to have the spotlight on</text>
  <text start="502.21" dur="5.63">them he took the spotlight moved it</text>
  <text start="504.46" dur="6.87">around and pointed it directly at them</text>
  <text start="507.84" dur="7.45">the people now know that if the economy</text>
  <text start="511.33" dur="7.35">fails they are to blame it shows that</text>
  <text start="515.29" dur="4.97">the Fed is not data dependent they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="518.68" dur="3.42">know what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="520.26" dur="5.32">Trump has said this many many times</text>
  <text start="522.1" dur="7.05">before who&amp;#39;s in control of all this the</text>
  <text start="525.58" dur="7.74">Patriots they&amp;#39;ve taken control of this</text>
  <text start="529.15" dur="6.75">illusionary economy I mean if we go back</text>
  <text start="533.32" dur="6.66">a little bit we look at Trump&amp;#39;s tweets</text>
  <text start="535.9" dur="5.91">we can see why he was doing this we can</text>
  <text start="539.98" dur="4.38">see that he was continually calling them</text>
  <text start="541.81" dur="4.89">out I mean go back to April 30 of 2019</text>
  <text start="544.36" dur="4.38">China is adding great stimulus to the</text>
  <text start="546.7" dur="4.29">economy while at the same time keeping</text>
  <text start="548.74" dur="4.2">interest rate low our Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="550.99" dur="4.46">has increasingly lifted interest rates</text>
  <text start="552.94" dur="4.44">even though inflation is very low and</text>
  <text start="555.45" dur="4.78">instituted a very big dose of</text>
  <text start="557.38" dur="6.6">quantitative tightening if you go to</text>
  <text start="560.23" dur="5.4">August 8 2019 as your president one</text>
  <text start="563.98" dur="3.99">would think that I would be thrilled</text>
  <text start="565.63" dur="3.78">with a very strong dollar I&amp;#39;m not the</text>
  <text start="567.97" dur="3.87">feds high interest rate level in</text>
  <text start="569.41" dur="4.71">comparison to other countries is keeping</text>
  <text start="571.84" dur="4.02">the dollar high making it more difficult</text>
  <text start="574.12" dur="4.77">for our great manufacturers like</text>
  <text start="575.86" dur="4.86">Caterpillar Boeing John Deere our car</text>
  <text start="578.89" dur="3.96">companies and others to compete on a</text>
  <text start="580.72" dur="4.35">level playing field with substantial Fed</text>
  <text start="582.85" dur="4.05">cuts there is no inflation and no</text>
  <text start="585.07" dur="3.87">quantitative tightening the dollar would</text>
  <text start="586.9" dur="4.08">make possible for our companies to win</text>
  <text start="588.94" dur="3.96">against any competitor we have the</text>
  <text start="590.98" dur="4.38">greatest companies in the world there is</text>
  <text start="592.9" dur="3.72">nobody even close but unfortunately the</text>
  <text start="595.36" dur="3.09">same cannot be said about a Federal</text>
  <text start="596.62" dur="3.24">Reserve they&amp;#39;ve called it wrong and</text>
  <text start="598.45" dur="3.84">every step of the way</text>
  <text start="599.86" dur="3.81">and we are still winning can you imagine</text>
  <text start="602.29" dur="3.51">what would happen if they actually</text>
  <text start="603.67" dur="5.61">called it right he&amp;#39;s letting the people</text>
  <text start="605.8" dur="5.9">know that Fed has no clue what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="609.28" dur="5.55">doing they said they were data specific</text>
  <text start="611.7" dur="5.98">they were data dependent we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="614.83" dur="6.6">at data this is how we decide well the</text>
  <text start="617.68" dur="7.41">decision is based on what now think</text>
  <text start="621.43" dur="7.14">about it Trump has turned this all</text>
  <text start="625.09" dur="6.2">around and he&amp;#39;s made it look like to the</text>
  <text start="628.57" dur="6.21">general public that the Fed is</text>
  <text start="631.29" dur="6.6">absolutely clueless now the Fed and</text>
  <text start="634.78" dur="5.58">banks they are beginning the path</text>
  <text start="637.89" dur="5.46">towards stimulus they&amp;#39;re creating the</text>
  <text start="640.36" dur="5.33">narrative now we knew this was coming I</text>
  <text start="643.35" dur="4.21">mean why do we need stimulus if</text>
  <text start="645.69" dur="7.48">unemployment is the lowest we&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="647.56" dur="7.44">seen why do we need a rate cut if GDP</text>
  <text start="653.17" dur="4.86">and everything else looks fantastic</text>
  <text start="655" dur="4.07">there&amp;#39;s no reason for it who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="658.03" dur="5.64">controlling them</text>
  <text start="659.07" dur="6.31">the Patriots now how is the Fed going to</text>
  <text start="663.67" dur="2.2">start stimulus can I just start it out</text>
  <text start="665.38" dur="3.57">of the blue</text>
  <text start="665.87" dur="6.27">absolutely not they need banks they need</text>
  <text start="668.95" dur="5.2">economists to come out and say hey this</text>
  <text start="672.14" dur="3.48">is why we&amp;#39;re gonna start quantitative</text>
  <text start="674.15" dur="4.14">easing because this reason that reason</text>
