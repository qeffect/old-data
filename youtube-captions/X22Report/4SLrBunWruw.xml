  <text start="199.77" dur="4.32">going to enforce it what&amp;#39;s the whole</text>
  <text start="201.81" dur="4.2">purpose of it and she was out there</text>
  <text start="204.09" dur="4.95">saying I&amp;#39;m sick and tired of people</text>
  <text start="206.01" dur="5.49">calling it sanctuary cities because they</text>
  <text start="209.04" dur="4.68">are not sanctuary cities they&amp;#39;re outlaw</text>
  <text start="211.5" dur="4.709">cities where they&amp;#39;re being protected</text>
  <text start="213.72" dur="5.7">these criminals who enter the country</text>
  <text start="216.209" dur="4.891">illegally they are being protected now</text>
  <text start="219.42" dur="3.87">we can see that Trump is out there he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="221.1" dur="4.83">tweeting like crazy and he&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="223.29" dur="4.26">about the officials behind the unmasking</text>
  <text start="225.93" dur="3.96">he&amp;#39;s saying that they&amp;#39;re high up we</text>
  <text start="227.55" dur="4.29">talked about this and we can see that</text>
  <text start="229.89" dur="4.86">this has nothing to do with Russia it</text>
  <text start="231.84" dur="4.83">has nothing to do with anything like</text>
  <text start="234.75" dur="4.8">that whatsoever it all had to do with</text>
  <text start="236.67" dur="4.5">political spying and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="239.55" dur="3.659">interesting about this is that the Obama</text>
  <text start="241.17" dur="5.7">spying well it looks like it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="243.209" dur="5.431">get worse then even Trump claimed it was</text>
  <text start="246.87" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really really bad right now</text>
  <text start="248.64" dur="4.89">and it this is the calling at Obama gate</text>
  <text start="250.53" dur="4.739">and we see that number one surveillance</text>
  <text start="253.53" dur="3.9">targeting the Trump team during the</text>
  <text start="255.269" dur="4.5">Obama administration began months ago</text>
  <text start="257.43" dur="5.01">even before the President had become the</text>
  <text start="259.769" dur="4.441">GOP nominee in July the spying on the</text>
  <text start="262.44" dur="3.81">Trump teen had nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="264.21" dur="4.14">collection of foreign intelligence or an</text>
  <text start="266.25" dur="5.13">investigation into Russia election</text>
  <text start="268.35" dur="5.31">interference the spying was done purely</text>
  <text start="271.38" dur="3.96">for political purposes that have nothing</text>
  <text start="273.66" dur="3.569">to do with the national security and</text>
  <text start="275.34" dur="4.23">everything to do with hurting and</text>
  <text start="277.229" dur="4.5">embarrassing Trump and his team the</text>
  <text start="279.57" dur="4.56">person who did the unmasking was someone</text>
  <text start="281.729" dur="4.981">very well known very high up as we know</text>
  <text start="284.13" dur="4.89">it was not FBI congressional</text>
  <text start="286.71" dur="5.43">investigators know the name of at least</text>
  <text start="289.02" dur="5.67">one person who was unmasking the names</text>
  <text start="292.14" dur="3.69">now now you can see why the deep State</text>
  <text start="294.69" dur="2.67">and the establishment they&amp;#39;re getting so</text>
  <text start="295.83" dur="5.37">worried about all of this the House</text>
  <text start="297.36" dur="6.6">Intelligence Committee Devin Nunez has</text>
  <text start="301.2" dur="6.42">known about the unmasking since January</text>
  <text start="303.96" dur="6.2">the sources also gave Nunez the serial</text>
  <text start="307.62" dur="5.669">numbers of the classified reports that</text>
  <text start="310.16" dur="5.319">documented the unmasking and there were</text>
  <text start="313.289" dur="2.761">only two places that Nunez could have it</text>
  <text start="315.479" dur="3.15">could have</text>
  <text start="316.05" dur="4.14">the information the Eisenhower executive</text>
  <text start="318.629" dur="3.51">office building on the White House</text>
  <text start="320.19" dur="4.439">grounds which houses the National</text>
  <text start="322.139" dur="4.171">Security Council and as computers linked</text>
  <text start="324.629" dur="5.25">to the secure system containing the</text>
  <text start="326.31" dur="7.68">reports he sought Nunez got access to</text>
  <text start="329.879" dur="7.38">that system as we know and basically he</text>
  <text start="333.99" dur="4.889">knows all this information this is why</text>
  <text start="337.259" dur="3.66">the deep state this is why the</text>
  <text start="338.879" dur="4.921">establishment this is why they are so</text>
  <text start="340.919" dur="6.361">nervous because they have the evidence</text>
  <text start="343.8" dur="6.33">now they know who these individuals are</text>
  <text start="347.28" dur="4.62">and this is why when you see the</text>
  <text start="350.13" dur="4.02">corporate media this is why when you see</text>
  <text start="351.9" dur="4.859">shift and the rest of these individuals</text>
  <text start="354.15" dur="4.71">out there saying in he has to recuse</text>
  <text start="356.759" dur="4.021">himself we need him off the panel we</text>
  <text start="358.86" dur="4.47">need the sources we need to know all the</text>
  <text start="360.78" dur="5.16">information because they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="363.33" dur="4.889">nervous now because all the information</text>
  <text start="365.94" dur="4.89">is going to come out the floodgates are</text>
  <text start="368.219" dur="5.581">going to open up and things are really</text>
  <text start="370.83" dur="5.16">going to get really really darn bad here</text>
  <text start="373.8" dur="3.329">and they know it and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="375.99" dur="3.419">stop it they&amp;#39;re trying to head it off at</text>
  <text start="377.129" dur="5.82">this point now we know that Trump is</text>
  <text start="379.409" dur="6.901">going to sign a bill to repeal Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="382.949" dur="5.37">broadband privacy rules and from the</text>
  <text start="386.31" dur="4.079">corporate media and I reported on this</text>
  <text start="388.319" dur="4.261">to where we said you know if he signs</text>
  <text start="390.389" dur="5.011">this law then everyone&amp;#39;s information is</text>
  <text start="392.58" dur="5.28">no longer private but when we start to</text>
  <text start="395.4" dur="5.1">look into this a little bit further we</text>
  <text start="397.86" dur="3.959">see some very interesting facts about</text>
  <text start="400.5" dur="4.529">all of this</text>
  <text start="401.819" dur="5.041">now the privacy bill would repeal that</text>
  <text start="405.029" dur="4.051">regulations adopted in October by the</text>
  <text start="406.86" dur="4.799">FCC under Obama administration the</text>
  <text start="409.08" dur="5.79">regulation required internet service</text>

  <text start="414.87" dur="5.25">data more stringently than content</text>
  <text start="417.33" dur="4.709">providers such as Google and Facebook so</text>
  <text start="420.12" dur="4.889">let&amp;#39;s think about this for a second ISP</text>
  <text start="422.039" dur="5.671">providers where you&amp;#39;re going through</text>
  <text start="425.009" dur="3.81">their service and data is flowing</text>
  <text start="427.71" dur="3.179">through it can be encrypted</text>
  <text start="428.819" dur="3.871">maybe it&amp;#39;s sometimes not encrypted but</text>
  <text start="430.889" dur="4.171">most of the information is encrypted if</text>
  <text start="432.69" dur="4.589">you&amp;#39;re dealing with banking email now</text>
  <text start="435.06" dur="2.94">and many other things a lot of is</text>
  <text start="437.279" dur="3.57">encrypted</text>
  <text start="438" dur="5.61">especially those secure transaction type</text>
  <text start="440.849" dur="4.68">of things and information that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="443.61" dur="4.799">dealing with Google and Facebook well</text>
  <text start="445.529" dur="4.35">they have all your information so when</text>
  <text start="448.409" dur="4.141">we look at this the FCC</text>
  <text start="449.879" dur="5.85">we acquired internet providers to obtain</text>
  <text start="452.55" dur="5.94">consumer consent before using location</text>

  <text start="466.139" dur="7.34">deliberate disinformation campaign up</text>
  <text start="469.199" dur="7.44">until 2015 the Federal Trade Commission</text>
  <text start="473.479" dur="6.131">protected consumer privacy and then the</text>

  <text start="479.61" dur="6.449">well they eviscerated the consumer</text>

  <text start="486.059" dur="6.21">the FTC&amp;#39;s jurisdiction the FCC then came</text>
  <text start="489.36" dur="5.25">around and hammered ISPs with a</text>
  <text start="492.269" dur="5.221">draconian regulation that do not apply</text>
  <text start="494.61" dur="4.559">to Google or Facebook now we know that</text>
  <text start="497.49" dur="4.62">Google and Facebook have a lot of</text>
  <text start="499.169" dur="4.98">information they keep track of all your</text>

  <text start="508.86" dur="4.169">the American commitment said that Google</text>
  <text start="510.659" dur="5.82">is trying to rig the system against the</text>

  <text start="536.49" dur="7.079">Soros and they&amp;#39;re pushing a lot of money</text>
  <text start="539.939" dur="6.481">to these narratives that the information</text>
  <text start="543.569" dur="5.311">the law needs to be with the FCC and</text>
  <text start="546.42" dur="4.529">they&amp;#39;re going to protect all the</text>

  <text start="558.209" dur="5.701">fight against the ISPs is a sideshow</text>
  <text start="561.449" dur="4.83">he&amp;#39;s saying by far the biggest threat to</text>
  <text start="563.91" dur="5.429">consumer privacy is Google that has</text>
  <text start="566.279" dur="5.851">trackers on over 60% of all web sites</text>
  <text start="569.339" dur="4.68">and Google owns YouTube and they own</text>
  <text start="572.13" dur="4.98">many other platforms and they have</text>
  <text start="574.019" dur="5.341">trackers everywhere and we can see that</text>
  <text start="577.11" dur="5.039">they&amp;#39;re trying to make it so Google</text>
  <text start="579.36" dur="4.17">YouTube Facebook they are never</text>

  <text start="583.53" dur="6.39">WikiLeaks was out there and they exposed</text>
  <text start="586.71" dur="5.61">the US government and their cyber budget</text>
  <text start="589.92" dur="5.16">where they&amp;#39;re saying that 90% of their</text>

  <text start="595.08" dur="6.27">attacking people and 10% of it is on</text>

  <text start="601.35" dur="4.14">cyber defense is terrible everyone was</text>
  <text start="604.35" dur="3.24">wondering how everything is getting</text>
  <text start="605.49" dur="4.86">hacked all the time because we care more</text>
  <text start="607.59" dur="5.01">about hacking others than we do</text>
  <text start="610.35" dur="4.32">defending everything here in the United</text>
  <text start="612.6" dur="4.59">States because this is exactly what the</text>

  <text start="641.1" dur="4.38">do and this is what they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="643.14" dur="4.56">not just here in the United States but</text>
  <text start="645.48" dur="5.58">around the world why to push their</text>
  <text start="647.7" dur="6.06">agenda we see right now Russia well they</text>
  <text start="651.06" dur="6.36">have accused NATO of manufacturing the</text>
  <text start="653.76" dur="5.58">opioid crisis in Afghanistan claiming</text>
  <text start="657.42" dur="3.33">that the United States directly benefits</text>
  <text start="659.34" dur="3.45">from the opium trade and we know that</text>
  <text start="660.75" dur="4.11">the poppy fields will they are guarded</text>
  <text start="662.79" dur="5.64">by the United States government central</text>
  <text start="664.86" dur="5.67">bankers actually the opium trade it was</text>
  <text start="668.43" dur="4.74">going down before the United States got</text>
  <text start="670.53" dur="5.91">their poppy fields really didn&amp;#39;t exist</text>
  <text start="673.17" dur="5.78">the way they do today now according to a</text>
  <text start="676.44" dur="6.15">Russian diplomat which is Sergey Lavrov</text>
  <text start="678.95" dur="5.5">Nadeau is working with drug producers</text>
  <text start="682.59" dur="3.78">and traffickers to flood the world with</text>
  <text start="684.45" dur="4.56">opium and he&amp;#39;s saying that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="686.37" dur="5.31">complete clear evidence that since the</text>
  <text start="689.01" dur="5.16">invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 the</text>
  <text start="691.68" dur="5.25">opium trade has skyrocketed</text>
  <text start="694.17" dur="5.73">so what exactly is the evidence well</text>
  <text start="696.93" dur="4.59">there was a 2014 report the UN notes</text>
  <text start="699.9" dur="4.86">that the poppy production had reached</text>
  <text start="701.52" dur="6.99">all-time global highs with the shocking</text>
  <text start="704.76" dur="6.6">increases in heroin users worldwide and</text>
  <text start="708.51" dur="4.95">the amount of land used for cultivating</text>
  <text start="711.36" dur="2.73">opium poppies around the world is at an</text>
  <text start="713.46" dur="2.88">all-time high</text>
  <text start="714.09" dur="3.09">and Afghanistan is largely behind the</text>
  <text start="716.34" dur="4.17">increase</text>
  <text start="717.18" dur="6">with its crops growing by 36% over a</text>
  <text start="720.51" dur="5.82">year producing 80% of the world&amp;#39;s opium</text>
  <text start="723.18" dur="5.03">and when we look at this and we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="726.33" dur="5.16">pictures of this before where the US</text>
  <text start="728.21" dur="5.98">soldiers they&amp;#39;re guarding the opium the</text>
  <text start="731.49" dur="4.92">poppy fields I should say and we can see</text>
  <text start="734.19" dur="4.92">right now that this is what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="736.41" dur="5.76">protecting in Afghanistan because they</text>
  <text start="739.11" dur="4.89">use the poppy fields to create these</text>
  <text start="742.17" dur="3.9">drugs and they sell these drugs</text>
  <text start="744" dur="5.49">worldwide to pay for their covert</text>
  <text start="746.07" dur="5.97">operations Tillerson is out there and he</text>
  <text start="749.49" dur="5.61">just came out and blasted Russia for</text>
  <text start="752.04" dur="4.47">Ukrainian aggression and this is</text>
  <text start="755.1" dur="3.09">absolutely ridiculous looks like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="756.51" dur="3.99">getting onboard with the deep state</text>
  <text start="758.19" dur="5.46">where he&amp;#39;s saying that Russia is the</text>
  <text start="760.5" dur="4.92">main problem in Ukraine and it was</text>
  <text start="763.65" dur="3.12">actually the United States who started</text>
  <text start="765.42" dur="4.05">the entire thing with the coup d&amp;#39;etat</text>
  <text start="766.77" dur="5.31">and they&amp;#39;re still there trying to push</text>
  <text start="769.47" dur="4.29">their agenda to take over the entire</text>
  <text start="772.08" dur="3.75">country this is what they wanted from</text>
  <text start="773.76" dur="4.05">the beginning to control the pipelines</text>
  <text start="775.83" dur="5.82">coming from Russia going into Europe</text>
  <text start="777.81" dur="4.98">this is why Joe Biden placed his son on</text>
  <text start="781.65" dur="4.56">the board of directors of one of the gas</text>
  <text start="782.79" dur="4.95">companies in Ukraine John Kerry had his</text>
  <text start="786.21" dur="3.33">roommate go on the board of directors of</text>
  <text start="787.74" dur="4.89">one of the gas companies in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="789.54" dur="5.43">after the coup d&amp;#39;etat the whole thing</text>
  <text start="792.63" dur="4.41">was planned we see out in Libya</text>
  <text start="794.97" dur="3.54">well the Libyan foreign minister is out</text>
  <text start="797.04" dur="5.31">there saying you know something this you</text>
  <text start="798.51" dur="6.57">naval operation called Operation Sophia</text>
  <text start="802.35" dur="4.83">which was lost in launched in 2015 to</text>
  <text start="805.08" dur="4.65">crack down on smugglers on the high seas</text>
  <text start="807.18" dur="5.37">well it seems like it&amp;#39;s happening having</text>
  <text start="809.73" dur="5.13">the opposite effect actually where it</text>
  <text start="812.55" dur="5.97">has not cracked down on any smuggling</text>
  <text start="814.86" dur="5.73">and it has made the migrant process even</text>
  <text start="818.52" dur="3.63">worse where they&amp;#39;re picking up</text>
  <text start="820.59" dur="3.27">individuals and more people seeing the</text>
  <text start="822.15" dur="3.69">ships out there where they get picked up</text>
  <text start="823.86" dur="4.2">that saying okay you know what we can</text>
  <text start="825.84" dur="4.44">leave the country and they bring them</text>
  <text start="828.06" dur="4.11">over to Greece they bring them over to</text>
  <text start="830.28" dur="4.29">Italy they bring them over to Turkey and</text>
  <text start="832.17" dur="5.34">I think this was all part of the plan to</text>
  <text start="834.57" dur="4.95">make it easier to get the refugees into</text>
  <text start="837.51" dur="4.92">these countries to make this a huge</text>
  <text start="839.52" dur="5.4">problem throughout Europe we see Iran</text>
  <text start="842.43" dur="4.56">right now is rejecting allegations by US</text>
  <text start="844.92" dur="4.29">defense secretary James mattis who said</text>
  <text start="846.99" dur="3.48">that Iran is the primary exporter of</text>
  <text start="849.21" dur="3.69">terrorism</text>
  <text start="850.47" dur="5.25">Iran and Syria and Russia are saying</text>
  <text start="852.9" dur="4.8">well no that&amp;#39;s not actually true maybe</text>
  <text start="855.72" dur="3.54">we should look at Saudi Arabia maybe we</text>
  <text start="857.7" dur="5.25">should look at the coalition forces who</text>
  <text start="859.26" dur="6">support al nusra al sham al Qaeda the</text>
  <text start="862.95" dur="4.62">Islamic state because that&amp;#39;s where the</text>
  <text start="865.26" dur="5.25">terrorism is and we&amp;#39;ve seen this all</text>
  <text start="867.57" dur="4.71">along that is where the terrorism is</text>
  <text start="870.51" dur="4.08">coming from if you look at all the</text>
  <text start="872.28" dur="5.97">countries with al Qaeda the Islamic</text>
  <text start="874.59" dur="6">state al nusra al sham Boko Haram this</text>
  <text start="878.25" dur="6.15">has all been created by the CIA Mossad</text>
  <text start="880.59" dur="6.09">mi6 and the rest of the countries to put</text>
  <text start="884.4" dur="5.49">terror into all of these countries so</text>
  <text start="886.68" dur="6.15">the coalition forces can garrison these</text>
  <text start="889.89" dur="4.98">countries and take control of their</text>
  <text start="892.83" dur="5.57">natural resources we see right now</text>
  <text start="894.87" dur="5.61">there&amp;#39;s scare tactics going on by the</text>
  <text start="898.4" dur="3.58">corporate media where they&amp;#39;re saying al</text>
  <text start="900.48" dur="3.03">Qaeda and the Islamic state remember al</text>
  <text start="901.98" dur="4.38">Qaeda in the Islamic state they have</text>
  <text start="903.51" dur="5.94">been created by the US government by the</text>
  <text start="906.36" dur="4.23">Intel agencies to scare the people to</text>
  <text start="909.45" dur="2.97">give up their rights and they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="910.59" dur="5.22">there saying that they are getting ready</text>
  <text start="912.42" dur="6.12">to create a laptop bomb well remember</text>
  <text start="915.81" dur="6.06">the shoe bomb remember the bombs inside</text>
  <text start="918.54" dur="6.27">women&amp;#39;s breasts bombs inside men&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="921.87" dur="4.59">stomachs this is just another scare</text>
  <text start="924.81" dur="3.36">tactic to make us believe that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="926.46" dur="3.66">gonna be placing a bomb in a laptop and</text>
  <text start="928.17" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re trying to explain away this is</text>
  <text start="930.12" dur="3.96">why there&amp;#39;s a ban on laptops now if you</text>
  <text start="932.37" dur="4.83">ever look inside of a laptop there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="934.08" dur="5.88">much room in there it is crammed I mean</text>
  <text start="937.2" dur="3.93">with everything inside the laptop if you</text>
  <text start="939.96" dur="3.33">ever open it up you&amp;#39;ll see there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="941.13" dur="3.51">really not that much room so to get an</text>
  <text start="943.29" dur="4.5">explosive device in there is gonna be</text>
  <text start="944.64" dur="5.94">pretty darn tough secondly this is</text>
  <text start="947.79" dur="4.89">another scare tactic to make you believe</text>
  <text start="950.58" dur="4.71">that these terrorists are coming to get</text>
  <text start="952.68" dur="4.62">us and of course I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised</text>
  <text start="955.29" dur="4.02">if they had some type of an event to</text>
  <text start="957.3" dur="4.08">scare people in giving up more of their</text>
  <text start="959.31" dur="3.57">rights because already we can see that</text>
  <text start="961.38" dur="3.96">people from certain countries right now</text>
  <text start="962.88" dur="4.26">can&amp;#39;t bring their laptops on the plane</text>
  <text start="965.34" dur="2.88">it&amp;#39;s pretty soon they&amp;#39;re gonna want you</text>
  <text start="967.14" dur="2.34">to log into your laptop</text>
  <text start="968.22" dur="3.27">pretty soon they&amp;#39;re gonna want you to</text>
  <text start="969.48" dur="3.84">look around the laptop because to get a</text>
  <text start="971.49" dur="4.17">bomb inside a laptop and actually have</text>
  <text start="973.32" dur="4.92">it turn on and function is gonna be</text>
  <text start="975.66" dur="4.17">quite difficult to do but of course</text>
  <text start="978.24" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to make it seem like</text>
  <text start="979.83" dur="4.619">it is possible but realistically this is</text>
  <text start="983.4" dur="3.479">another scam</text>
  <text start="984.449" dur="4.62">tactic that the deep state is trying to</text>
