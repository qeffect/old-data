  <text start="56.76" dur="5.52">is january 25th 2017 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="60.149" dur="4.171">the episode is everything is about to</text>
  <text start="62.28" dur="6.06">change and the people are going to feel</text>
  <text start="64.32" dur="6.72">the economic shock let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="68.34" dur="7.309">economic collapse financial news well</text>
  <text start="71.04" dur="8.369">today we see the Dow has finally hit</text>
  <text start="75.649" dur="5.321">20,000 points now what now many people</text>
  <text start="79.409" dur="4.471">say that this is going to continually</text>
  <text start="80.97" dur="5.22">move up and up and up well I really</text>
  <text start="83.88" dur="7.08">don&amp;#39;t think so i think what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="86.19" dur="6.39">right now is that the elite those people</text>
  <text start="90.96" dur="5.85">who understand what is going on the</text>
  <text start="92.58" dur="6.599">insiders they realize that well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="96.81" dur="4.86">going to drop the economy either Trump</text>
  <text start="99.179" dur="4.171">is going to beat them to it or they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="101.67" dur="4.53">going to do it because we are</text>
  <text start="103.35" dur="5.21">approaching a period of time where</text>
  <text start="106.2" dur="5.75">there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot of pain in</text>
  <text start="108.56" dur="6.94">America and most likely a lot of people</text>
  <text start="111.95" dur="5.259">are going to blame Trump other people</text>
  <text start="115.5" dur="6.63">are going to say he has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="117.209" dur="9.36">with this and we can see as time goes on</text>
  <text start="122.13" dur="7.14">why he needs to be there because he</text>
  <text start="126.569" dur="6.121">understands bankruptcy he understands</text>
  <text start="129.27" dur="7.43">defaulting he understands reorganization</text>
  <text start="132.69" dur="9.24">and he understands what it feels like to</text>
  <text start="136.7" dur="8.92">take the heat to take the pain and many</text>
  <text start="141.93" dur="7.26">people who are in the US who believe</text>
  <text start="145.62" dur="6.81">that this is going to last forever that</text>
  <text start="149.19" dur="7.01">this will never end that everything that</text>
  <text start="152.43" dur="7.8">I have is safe well they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="156.2" dur="7.86">in for a rude awakening they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="160.23" dur="8.19">feel the economic shock when it hits and</text>
  <text start="164.06" dur="7.36">a lot of people are not going to be able</text>
  <text start="168.42" dur="6.42">to handle this too well I mean there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="171.42" dur="4.53">no other way to put this because what</text>
  <text start="174.84" dur="4.409">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a</text>
  <text start="175.95" dur="4.349">deterioration of the real economic data</text>
  <text start="179.249" dur="2.161">so I&amp;#39;m not talking about the stock</text>
  <text start="180.299" dur="4.291">market</text>
  <text start="181.41" dur="5.21">this dark market is completely fake the</text>
  <text start="184.59" dur="7.98">stock market means absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="186.62" dur="8.4">all it means is that everyone is in the</text>
  <text start="192.57" dur="5.7">illusionary world looking at the market</text>
  <text start="195.02" dur="6.64">thinking that everything is fine but</text>
  <text start="198.27" dur="6.09">everything underneath that well it is</text>
  <text start="201.66" dur="4.89">not fine and we&amp;#39;re starting to see a lot</text>
  <text start="204.36" dur="4.95">of information come out looking that</text>
  <text start="206.55" dur="5.04">looking like that nothing is going well</text>
  <text start="209.31" dur="6.72">what so ever think about all the stores</text>
  <text start="211.59" dur="6.63">that have closed think about how many</text>
  <text start="216.03" dur="5.34">people have been laid off how many</text>
  <text start="218.22" dur="5.58">manufacturing plants left the United</text>
  <text start="221.37" dur="4.77">States I mean this happened over many</text>
  <text start="223.8" dur="4.98">many years it just didn&amp;#39;t happen one day</text>
  <text start="226.14" dur="4.65">I mean we&amp;#39;re looking back now and saying</text>
  <text start="228.78" dur="5.31">what what just happened here but this</text>
  <text start="230.79" dur="6.18">has been ongoing and there are other</text>
  <text start="234.09" dur="4.56">countries out there that have the</text>
  <text start="236.97" dur="4.41">manufacturing they have the ability to</text>
  <text start="238.65" dur="6.9">pay these individuals who work in these</text>
  <text start="241.38" dur="7.59">factories a lot less and more efficient</text>
  <text start="245.55" dur="5.76">and to bring everything back it can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="248.97" dur="5.31">done in one year you can start the</text>
  <text start="251.31" dur="4.29">process and I believe that&amp;#39;s what Trump</text>
  <text start="254.28" dur="4.019">is doing right now he&amp;#39;s starting the</text>
  <text start="255.6" dur="5.34">process because you need to start</text>
  <text start="258.299" dur="5.131">someplace and I understand that but to</text>
  <text start="260.94" dur="4.89">recover this economy right now and make</text>
  <text start="263.43" dur="3.81">it whole again it&amp;#39;s not going to work</text>
  <text start="265.83" dur="4.95">because we were a heard from the budget</text>
  <text start="267.24" dur="6.09">director talking about the debt and we</text>
  <text start="270.78" dur="5.73">can see already that Trump is starting</text>
  <text start="273.33" dur="7.32">to make a lot of cuts and people are not</text>
  <text start="276.51" dur="7.89">going to be happy whatsoever and when</text>
  <text start="280.65" dur="5.88">the main cut comes well this is going to</text>
  <text start="284.4" dur="4.74">ripple throughout the United States and</text>
  <text start="286.53" dur="5.4">many people are not going to be happy</text>
  <text start="289.14" dur="6.54">now we know the debt ceiling vote comes</text>
  <text start="291.93" dur="5.73">up in March most likely it will pass</text>
  <text start="295.68" dur="4.5">because at this point there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="297.66" dur="4.77">else they can do now what happens if it</text>
  <text start="300.18" dur="4.53">doesn&amp;#39;t pass what happens if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="302.43" dur="6.75">raise the debt level think about how</text>
  <text start="304.71" dur="6.36">many programs just completely stopped</text>
  <text start="309.18" dur="3.83">they can&amp;#39;t function anymore because the</text>
  <text start="311.07" dur="3.069">government can&amp;#39;t borrow any more money</text>
  <text start="313.01" dur="4.999">think of</text>
  <text start="314.139" dur="6.15">what happens to the dollar now if they</text>
  <text start="318.009" dur="5.761">raise the debt ceiling it just prolongs</text>
  <text start="320.289" dur="6.511">what is coming and we can see already</text>
  <text start="323.77" dur="5.519">that Trump is preparing for this and</text>
  <text start="326.8" dur="5.07">when we look at the real hard data out</text>
  <text start="329.289" dur="3.93">there when we look at retail for</text>
  <text start="331.87" dur="3.509">instance we know a lot of stores are</text>
  <text start="333.219" dur="4.35">closing a lot of people got laid off we</text>
  <text start="335.379" dur="5.22">see that mall owners well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="337.569" dur="6.75">rushing for the exits commercial</text>
  <text start="340.599" dur="7.47">mortgage-backed securities well defaults</text>
  <text start="344.319" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re up all across the country with</text>
  <text start="348.069" dur="6.291">liquidations up eleven percent</text>
  <text start="350.199" dur="10.34">year-on-year what does that tell you</text>
  <text start="354.36" dur="10.48">that tells you that retail is dying</text>
  <text start="360.539" dur="7.09">because the everyday person who would</text>
  <text start="364.84" dur="6.09">normally go out and purchase retail</text>
  <text start="367.629" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;re not doing it even online it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="370.93" dur="5.909">not happening and we&amp;#39;re seeing more and</text>
  <text start="373.749" dur="4.41">more stores closed which means there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="376.839" dur="4.89">lot more real estate I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="378.159" dur="7.141">like 90 billion dollars worth of real</text>
  <text start="381.729" dur="5.071">estate in the commercial realm and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="385.3" dur="5.07">getting worse as time goes on look at</text>
  <text start="386.8" dur="6.359">caterpillar for instance caterpillar</text>
  <text start="390.37" dur="6.24">stock continues to soar and its</text>
  <text start="393.159" dur="10.07">operations continue to decline they have</text>
  <text start="396.61" dur="9.359">forty nine months of declining sales</text>
  <text start="403.229" dur="5.53">that&amp;#39;s longer than the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="405.969" dur="6.57">the Great Recession was nineteen months</text>
  <text start="408.759" dur="6.361">and we can see that sales are not</text>
  <text start="412.539" dur="5.49">getting better if we look at North</text>
  <text start="415.12" dur="5.009">America if we look out in Europe Latin</text>
  <text start="418.029" dur="4.14">America we see they&amp;#39;ve declined by</text>
  <text start="420.129" dur="5.88">twelve percent twenty one percent and</text>
  <text start="422.169" dur="5.46">thirty-four percent and I understand</text>
  <text start="426.009" dur="4.02">that Trump wants to bring all these jobs</text>
  <text start="427.629" dur="4.26">back and like I said just before that</text>
  <text start="430.029" dur="4.98">he&amp;#39;s doing this and setting it up for</text>
  <text start="431.889" dur="6.96">after the reset because right now he</text>
  <text start="435.009" dur="6.75">understands that this system it can&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="438.849" dur="5.28">anywhere so it looks like he&amp;#39;s setting</text>
  <text start="441.759" dur="4.991">up for a bankruptcy of the United States</text>
  <text start="444.129" dur="5.261">and getting ready to</text>
  <text start="446.75" dur="4.05">restart it and I think a lot of people</text>
  <text start="449.39" dur="3.09">when they look at this they think well</text>
  <text start="450.8" dur="2.73">oh look he&amp;#39;s just going to bring back</text>
  <text start="452.48" dur="4.68">jobs and everything&amp;#39;s going to be fine</text>
  <text start="453.53" dur="5.88">and this is furthest from the truth he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="457.16" dur="5.31">going to bring back jobs after we go</text>
  <text start="459.41" dur="5.04">through the pain because we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="462.47" dur="4.68">need to restart we&amp;#39;re going to need to</text>
  <text start="464.45" dur="4.65">rebuild and we&amp;#39;re going to go through</text>
  <text start="467.15" dur="5.33">this time period where it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="469.1" dur="6.21">be pretty now we see right now that</text>
  <text start="472.48" dur="4.9">Kevin Brady the chief tax policy in</text>
  <text start="475.31" dur="5.13">capitol hill well he launched a robust</text>
  <text start="477.38" dur="5.67">defense eyes of his proposal of tax</text>
  <text start="480.44" dur="5.64">imports and it sorts of tie-in with</text>
  <text start="483.05" dur="4.83">Donald Trump&amp;#39;s America first economic</text>
  <text start="486.08" dur="4.92">agenda but the problem with this in the</text>
  <text start="487.88" dur="6.3">same thing with the border tax is that</text>
  <text start="491" dur="7.29">it&amp;#39;s not compliant with the World Trade</text>
  <text start="494.18" dur="5.58">Organization now they all know this they</text>
  <text start="498.29" dur="3.629">know that this is not compliant</text>
  <text start="499.76" dur="5.3">whatsoever but they know that it will</text>
  <text start="501.919" dur="5.491">take years to settle and they know that</text>
  <text start="505.06" dur="4.63">they will be able to use it at this</text>
  <text start="507.41" dur="4.08">point if they push it forward and the</text>
  <text start="509.69" dur="5.31">worry about the ramifications a lot</text>
  <text start="511.49" dur="6.54">later so I don&amp;#39;t know how far they will</text>
  <text start="515" dur="4.669">get with this because right now if</text>
  <text start="518.03" dur="6.72">they&amp;#39;re going to start a trade war</text>
  <text start="519.669" dur="7.541">nobody is going to win a trade war we</text>
  <text start="524.75" dur="6.42">see from the Hoover Institute and they</text>
  <text start="527.21" dur="6.33">report that in trade wars nobody wins</text>
  <text start="531.17" dur="5.34">they did a whole study on this and it</text>
  <text start="533.54" dur="7.44">doesn&amp;#39;t work and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="536.51" dur="9.44">that Mexico well they&amp;#39;re looking to quit</text>
  <text start="540.98" dur="8.51">NAFTA if Trump crosses the red line</text>
  <text start="545.95" dur="8.139">because he wants to renegotiate NAFTA</text>
  <text start="549.49" dur="8.17">now I mean if Mexico wants to leave so</text>
  <text start="554.089" dur="6.211">be it I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s really a big</text>
  <text start="557.66" dur="5.85">deal at this point there&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="560.3" dur="5.37">important things going on here then</text>
  <text start="563.51" dur="5.07">these trade agreements because what is</text>
  <text start="565.67" dur="5.34">happening is the economy well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="568.58" dur="6.02">deteriorating now we understand that the</text>
  <text start="571.01" dur="6.93">Fed and these different individuals in</text>
  <text start="574.6" dur="4.37">government well they want the interest</text>
  <text start="577.94" dur="2.56">rates to</text>
  <text start="578.97" dur="8.21">go back to normal now interest rate to</text>
  <text start="580.5" dur="10.019">read 6.6 2% prior to the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="587.18" dur="7.329">can you imagine if interest rates went</text>
  <text start="590.519" dur="6.63">back to six percent on the 20 trillion</text>
  <text start="594.509" dur="6.89">dollars that would be 1.2 trillion a</text>
  <text start="597.149" dur="9.471">year in interest expense right now</text>
  <text start="601.399" dur="7.69">that&amp;#39;s completely impossible to sustain</text>
  <text start="606.62" dur="5.56">its thirty one percent of the federal</text>
  <text start="609.089" dur="8.161">budget which would mean massive cuts in</text>
  <text start="612.18" dur="7.29">every other spending program so right</text>
  <text start="617.25" dur="5.819">now we understand that there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="619.47" dur="8.669">and no way out of this unless we default</text>
  <text start="623.069" dur="7.71">unless we collapse so the White House is</text>
  <text start="628.139" dur="5.19">taking this one step further while all</text>
  <text start="630.779" dur="6.331">this is happening we see US Treasury</text>
  <text start="633.329" dur="6.45">nominee Stephen muchin well he voiced</text>
  <text start="637.11" dur="6.87">his support for a higher standard of</text>
  <text start="639.779" dur="5.79">transparency in the feds actions and we</text>
  <text start="643.98" dur="5.19">can see right now that Rand Paul and</text>
  <text start="645.569" dur="6.56">others they&amp;#39;re pushing this bill which</text>
  <text start="649.17" dur="6.51">is gaining traction now to audit the Fed</text>
  <text start="652.129" dur="6.671">now the Fed most likely will not let</text>
  <text start="655.68" dur="5.839">this happen they don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="658.8" dur="6.06">audited they like their independence</text>
  <text start="661.519" dur="4.781">they&amp;#39;re on a different mission than the</text>
  <text start="664.86" dur="3.69">rest of the people here in the United</text>
  <text start="666.3" dur="4.68">States and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="668.55" dur="4.829">is that Donald Trump on the campaign</text>
  <text start="670.98" dur="5.19">trail well he repeatedly attacked the</text>
  <text start="673.379" dur="5.7">Fed for being excessively politicized</text>
  <text start="676.17" dur="5.219">and playing along to the Democrat agenda</text>
  <text start="679.079" dur="4.221">of the ultra affordable credit and the</text>
  <text start="681.389" dur="4.411">off-limits balance sheet expansion</text>
  <text start="683.3" dur="4.81">resulting in huge amount of funds being</text>
  <text start="685.8" dur="6.99">squandered at the expense of the higher</text>
  <text start="688.11" dur="6.269">US national debt and he went on to say</text>
  <text start="692.79" dur="3.659">that I used to think they were</text>
  <text start="694.379" dur="4.32">independent and the Fed is obviously not</text>
  <text start="696.449" dur="3.93">independent it&amp;#39;s obviously not even</text>
  <text start="698.699" dur="4.62">close to being independent drum set I</text>
  <text start="700.379" dur="5.64">would want to have a policy where we can</text>
  <text start="703.319" dur="6.931">begin to gently reduce debt because</text>
  <text start="706.019" dur="6.531">right now it is not under control what</text>
  <text start="710.25" dur="4.88">happens if the inter</text>
  <text start="712.55" dur="5.94">rates go up fairly substantial he said</text>
  <text start="715.13" dur="7.17">what happens with all the money we have</text>
  <text start="718.49" dur="5.969">and we are borrowing you know what that</text>
  <text start="722.3" dur="5.88">does to our balance sheet I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="724.459" dur="6.991">a cost that&amp;#39;s beyond belief and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="728.18" dur="8.07">absolutely right he understands that</text>
  <text start="731.45" dur="7.46">this cannot be sustained and this is why</text>
  <text start="736.25" dur="5.72">I&amp;#39;m thinking all of this publicity</text>
  <text start="738.91" dur="7.239">everything that he is doing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="741.97" dur="5.77">preparing for this reset because the</text>
  <text start="746.149" dur="3.69">jobs cannot be creating now let&amp;#39;s take</text>
  <text start="747.74" dur="3.99">all the numbers and add them all up I</text>
  <text start="749.839" dur="3.211">mean you add them all up and maybe the</text>
