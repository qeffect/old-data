  <text start="29.64" dur="6.03">is dave and this is episode 180 and</text>
  <text start="31.73" dur="7.509">today&amp;#39;s date is October fourth 2013 and</text>
  <text start="35.67" dur="6.27">the title of this episode is is DC</text>
  <text start="39.239" dur="5.64">preparing for a cataclysmic event of</text>
  <text start="41.94" dur="6.74">epic proportion and what we saw happen</text>
  <text start="44.879" dur="6.631">in DC we saw a woman with a child</text>
  <text start="48.68" dur="5.469">surrounded by police with guns now</text>
  <text start="51.51" dur="6.599">remind you this woman was unarmed there</text>
  <text start="54.149" dur="6.78">was a child in the car the police had</text>
  <text start="58.109" dur="5.011">her surrounded they did have the ability</text>
  <text start="60.929" dur="4.861">to shoot out her tires they did have the</text>
  <text start="63.12" dur="5.25">ability to call in other cars to block</text>
  <text start="65.79" dur="5.85">her in there they did have the ability</text>
  <text start="68.37" dur="5.85">to break her window in the back to grab</text>
  <text start="71.64" dur="8.85">hold of her they had many different</text>
  <text start="74.22" dur="8.64">options instead they let her leave they</text>
  <text start="80.49" dur="6.39">pursued her and then shot her in cold</text>
  <text start="82.86" dur="5.88">blood and the corporate media is pushing</text>
  <text start="86.88" dur="5.91">this and saying oh they did their job is</text>
  <text start="88.74" dur="6.68">a great thing we have Congress out there</text>
  <text start="92.79" dur="6.66">saying this is fantastic but I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="95.42" dur="5.979">the last course of action is shooting</text>
  <text start="99.45" dur="5.01">when they don&amp;#39;t when someone doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="101.399" dur="5.941">shoot back there are many other options</text>
  <text start="104.46" dur="5.97">and these police officers are trained to</text>
  <text start="107.34" dur="5.669">do many other things before they shoot</text>
  <text start="110.43" dur="5.27">and kill especially when there&amp;#39;s a child</text>
  <text start="113.009" dur="6.03">and a woman who does not pose a threat</text>
  <text start="115.7" dur="5.65">did not have a gun and if you look at</text>
  <text start="119.039" dur="5.701">the video when they had her surrounded</text>
  <text start="121.35" dur="5.189">they had the story that she crashed into</text>
  <text start="124.74" dur="3.36">the barrier and she was trying to get</text>
  <text start="126.539" dur="4.641">into the White House but if you look at</text>
  <text start="128.1" dur="7.44">the front of the car there was no damage</text>
  <text start="131.18" dur="8.32">how did she crash into a barrier with no</text>
  <text start="135.54" dur="5.279">damage the only damage you see is when</text>
  <text start="139.5" dur="4.319">she was backing up</text>
  <text start="140.819" dur="6.03">pulling away and they did have many</text>
  <text start="143.819" dur="5.221">other opportunities and other tactics</text>
  <text start="146.849" dur="4.62">they could have used but what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="149.04" dur="6.75">doing is they want to see how people</text>
  <text start="151.469" dur="9.151">react how are you reacting that a woman</text>
  <text start="155.79" dur="7.649">with a child was shot in cold blood and</text>
  <text start="160.62" dur="6.42">killed now this child does not have a</text>
  <text start="163.439" dur="6.48">mother at this time we see the corporate</text>
  <text start="167.04" dur="8.46">media praising this we see Congress</text>
  <text start="169.919" dur="9.361">applauding this secondly you see the</text>
  <text start="175.5" dur="6.68">drill taking place in DC what are they</text>
  <text start="179.28" dur="6.959">preparing for we understand that</text>
  <text start="182.18" dur="7.179">trucker&amp;#39;s are arriving in October to ask</text>
  <text start="186.239" dur="6.81">President Obama to step down and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="189.359" dur="6.181">stopping deliveries for three days we</text>
  <text start="193.049" dur="5.821">have another protest happening in</text>
  <text start="195.54" dur="7.379">November where I think it&amp;#39;s Larry</text>
  <text start="198.87" dur="6.539">Klayman is coming down to Washington and</text>
  <text start="202.919" dur="7.611">he wants everyone to come down there and</text>
  <text start="205.409" dur="9.51">descend on DC to ask for Obama to resign</text>
  <text start="210.53" dur="9.519">so are they preparing for something that</text>
  <text start="214.919" dur="9.361">might happen are they looking to make</text>
  <text start="220.049" dur="5.791">sure they have the ability to lock down</text>
  <text start="224.28" dur="3.629">the city you heard I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="225.84" dur="5.009">everyone heard this you heard on the</text>

  <text start="240.72" dur="5.479">Congress debating at the same time and</text>
  <text start="243.689" dur="5.19">they were rushed and put into safety</text>
  <text start="246.199" dur="4.81">police surrounding the capitol building</text>
  <text start="248.879" dur="5.67">and all the other areas were locked down</text>
  <text start="251.009" dur="7.431">ready to move and it to me it seemed</text>
  <text start="254.549" dur="6.15">like a preparation for something to come</text>
  <text start="258.44" dur="4.509">now before I get started with the</text>
  <text start="260.699" dur="4.741">economic collapse news I just want to</text>

  <text start="285.03" dur="6.84">that so after the report stick around</text>
  <text start="288.06" dur="7.199">and listen to his music about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="291.87" dur="5.19">going on right now in the world now</text>
  <text start="295.259" dur="4.891">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="297.06" dur="6.09">news we&amp;#39;re going to go out to Greece and</text>
  <text start="300.15" dur="5.639">their drop list rate they&amp;#39;re predicting</text>
  <text start="303.15" dur="6.15">right now is going to hit thirty four</text>
  <text start="305.789" dur="7.37">percent by 2016 now it could go higher</text>
  <text start="309.3" dur="7.169">because right now they are on track to</text>
  <text start="313.159" dur="5.651">hit twenty nine percent by the end of</text>
  <text start="316.469" dur="4.26">the year currently it&amp;#39;s at twenty-seven</text>
  <text start="318.81" dur="6.81">percent and they&amp;#39;re expecting it to be</text>
  <text start="320.729" dur="7.8">at thirty 1.5% by 2014 now if the</text>
  <text start="325.62" dur="4.44">economy in Greece which when they first</text>

  <text start="345.87" dur="5.19">more interest payments on their debt and</text>
  <text start="347.729" dur="5.521">more debt so what do you see you see</text>
  <text start="351.06" dur="6.99">something that cannot be sustained and</text>
  <text start="353.25" dur="7.639">it&amp;#39;s rearing its evil head right now and</text>
  <text start="358.05" dur="6.209">grease is on the verge of a complete</text>
  <text start="360.889" dur="5.65">collapse they can continually funded</text>
  <text start="364.259" dur="6.241">money to try to keep the country going</text>
  <text start="366.539" dur="8.461">but it is collapsing and imploding right</text>
  <text start="370.5" dur="7.71">now here in America the economic growth</text>
  <text start="375" dur="7.56">gauge slips and it slipped to a</text>
  <text start="378.21" dur="6.15">four-week low and it looks like things</text>

  <text start="384.36" dur="5.519">also reports coming out because of this</text>
  <text start="386.189" dur="7.051">debate over the shutdown fourth quarter</text>
  <text start="389.879" dur="7.111">is really not looking good and this</text>
  <text start="393.24" dur="7.41">could have catastrophic repercussions</text>

  <text start="400.65" dur="7.559">shutdown Lockheed is going to furlough</text>

  <text start="428.97" dur="4.8">money before the fiscal year ended for</text>
  <text start="431.22" dur="5.07">them which was September 30th and now</text>

  <text start="436.29" dur="8.73">the government with pre shutdown they</text>
  <text start="441.479" dur="7.041">are talking about all this bad news of</text>
  <text start="445.02" dur="6.33">how the economy is going to crumble and</text>
  <text start="448.52" dur="5.68">right now we know the housing industry</text>
  <text start="451.35" dur="4.74">is not sustainable what they really want</text>
  <text start="454.2" dur="5.4">is they really want the American people</text>
  <text start="456.09" dur="5.79">to believe that the economy is taking a</text>
  <text start="459.6" dur="4.02">downturn because of what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="461.88" dur="4.53">right now that&amp;#39;s not what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="463.62" dur="8.91">what&amp;#39;s happening is the economy was</text>
  <text start="466.41" dur="10.47">already taking a downturn this is the</text>
  <text start="472.53" dur="9.15">distraction the cover up to take a way</text>
  <text start="476.88" dur="8.34">of what&amp;#39;s really going on and if you</text>
  <text start="481.68" dur="5.34">notice today the stock market and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="485.22" dur="4.05">Friday and this normally happens on</text>
  <text start="487.02" dur="6.63">friday the stock market was down during</text>
  <text start="489.27" dur="8.91">the first second days of the shutdown</text>
  <text start="493.65" dur="8.55">and then just magically the stock market</text>
  <text start="498.18" dur="9.75">closes in the green and gold is again</text>
  <text start="502.2" dur="8.189">suppressed now we know things are not</text>
  <text start="507.93" dur="5.039">going well because in the past I told</text>
  <text start="510.389" dur="5.191">you the housing market Wells Fargo</text>
  <text start="512.969" dur="5.551">Citibank Bank of America all laying off</text>
  <text start="515.58" dur="4.23">thousands of people and mortgage</text>
  <text start="518.52" dur="3.329">applications with declining and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="519.81" dur="5.219">discussed this before but now we see</text>
  <text start="521.849" dur="6.661">another mortgage company PHH mortgage is</text>
  <text start="525.029" dur="8.971">laying off a third of its workforce</text>
  <text start="528.51" dur="9.99">that&amp;#39;s 365 more people if the economy</text>
  <text start="534" dur="6.75">and the housing is booming why all the</text>
  <text start="538.5" dur="3.91">layoffs in the mortgage industry it</text>
  <text start="540.75" dur="5.41">makes no</text>
  <text start="542.41" dur="7.619">sense the only sense it makes is the</text>
  <text start="546.16" dur="7.859">housing recovery was fake now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="550.029" dur="6.24">declining they can&amp;#39;t keep it up the way</text>
  <text start="554.019" dur="5.101">they have been and it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="556.269" dur="8.331">falling apart and that is what makes</text>
  <text start="559.12" dur="10.949">sense now marketwatch asked the Treasury</text>
  <text start="564.6" dur="10.599">if they would consider using some of the</text>
  <text start="570.069" dur="7.471">country&amp;#39;s gold to pay the bills if the</text>
  <text start="575.199" dur="6.93">but the budget price that budget crisis</text>
  <text start="577.54" dur="7.589">escalates later this month and the</text>
  <text start="582.129" dur="6.15">Treasury said that they consider it but</text>
  <text start="585.129" dur="7.531">they&amp;#39;re not going to do it now their</text>
  <text start="588.279" dur="9.091">reasoning is that if we use the gold it</text>
  <text start="592.66" dur="8.82">would send a wave of uncertainty</text>
  <text start="597.37" dur="6.6">throughout the world and it would show</text>
  <text start="601.48" dur="7.68">that the u.s. had a resort to their gold</text>
  <text start="603.97" dur="9.02">reserves to fix the situation but if you</text>
  <text start="609.16" dur="7.529">remember when Ron Paul was um</text>
  <text start="612.99" dur="6.88">questioning the Fed about gold he said</text>
  <text start="616.689" dur="5.25">it was relic it&amp;#39;s not important but here</text>
  <text start="619.87" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;re making it that it is important</text>
  <text start="621.939" dur="7.14">very confusing where is it the real</text>
  <text start="625.93" dur="7.909">reason I think they will never go to use</text>
  <text start="629.079" dur="8.641">the reserve the gold in Fort Knox and</text>
  <text start="633.839" dur="7.451">they will never use it is because it</text>
  <text start="637.72" dur="4.95">really isn&amp;#39;t there and as they said they</text>
  <text start="641.29" dur="3.96">were going to use it and they actually</text>
  <text start="642.67" dur="5.55">would have to go down to get it there</text>
  <text start="645.25" dur="7.709">would be nothing there to use and that I</text>
  <text start="648.22" dur="6.599">believe is the real problem and let me</text>
  <text start="652.959" dur="3.451">just read I&amp;#39;ll just read the part the</text>
  <text start="654.819" dur="4.7">Treasury has considered that option</text>
  <text start="656.41" dur="5.849">among the many others and rejected it</text>
  <text start="659.519" dur="6.971">selling gold would undercut confidence</text>
  <text start="662.259" dur="6.75">in the US both here and abroad and would</text>
  <text start="666.49" dur="4.949">be destabilizing to the world financial</text>
  <text start="669.009" dur="4.231">system but it&amp;#39;s kind of confusing</text>
  <text start="671.439" dur="4.471">because they&amp;#39;re trying to tell us that</text>
  <text start="673.24" dur="3.15">gold is unimportant it&amp;#39;s a relic it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="675.91" dur="2.31">not</text>
  <text start="676.39" dur="4.02">really money but in this statement</text>
  <text start="678.22" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re telling us that gold is very</text>
  <text start="680.41" dur="7.19">important that it&amp;#39;s part of the</text>
  <text start="683.2" dur="9.27">financial system that it would undercut</text>
  <text start="687.6" dur="8.26">confidence and it&amp;#39;s a very flip-floppy</text>
  <text start="692.47" dur="6.57">in what they perceive gold as and we all</text>
  <text start="695.86" dur="7.41">know a gold is it&amp;#39;s real money I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="699.04" dur="6.96">believe the Fed the US has any gold</text>
  <text start="703.27" dur="5.61">anymore I believe it has been shipped</text>
  <text start="706" dur="5.55">off moved away because they understand</text>
  <text start="708.88" dur="5.13">that is real money and the Fed and the</text>
  <text start="711.55" dur="6.78">central bankers have already taken it</text>
  <text start="714.01" dur="6.65">and it&amp;#39;s no longer around now there is a</text>
  <text start="718.33" dur="5.97">report out there saying that banks are</text>
  <text start="720.66" dur="5.92">stuffing ATMs with twenty to thirty</text>
  <text start="724.3" dur="6.68">percent more cash in case of a panic</text>
  <text start="726.58" dur="7.56">withdrawals and they see that the the</text>
  <text start="730.98" dur="7.09">the shutdown goes a lot longer than they</text>
  <text start="734.14" dur="8.34">expected and it we hit that October 1718</text>
  <text start="738.07" dur="7.11">date and the US government default and</text>
  <text start="742.48" dur="7.23">they cannot make any payments so they</text>
  <text start="745.18" dur="5.81">are preparing the ATMs for a bank run</text>
  <text start="749.71" dur="3.6">but I&amp;#39;m going to tell you right now</text>
  <text start="750.99" dur="5.05">putting twenty to thirty percent more</text>
  <text start="753.31" dur="5.31">cash in the ATMs that will be gone and</text>
  <text start="756.04" dur="6.27">drained in a matter of minutes if there</text>
  <text start="758.62" dur="5.76">is some type of bank run and it will not</text>
  <text start="762.31" dur="4.05">be able they will not be able to keep up</text>
  <text start="764.38" dur="5.76">with the amount of people trying to get</text>
  <text start="766.36" dur="6.06">their money out and it&amp;#39;s just amazing</text>
  <text start="770.14" dur="5.1">that they&amp;#39;re thinking in this way so</text>
  <text start="772.42" dur="5.04">they must have got some type of notice</text>
  <text start="775.24" dur="4.56">or something that something might be</text>
  <text start="777.46" dur="8.79">occurring to take this type of</text>
  <text start="779.8" dur="8.07">precaution at this time now we</text>
  <text start="786.25" dur="3.75">understand that the government shutdown</text>

  <text start="1751.56" dur="5.4">seen this from many other places and he</text>
  <text start="1754.2" dur="5.43">said this before and they continually to</text>

  <text start="1770.13" dur="5.79">software that completely leaves them</text>
  <text start="1772.92" dur="5.16">open to attack and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1775.92" dur="4.67">putting together this drill in November</text>
  <text start="1778.08" dur="5.58">to test the Power Grid infrastructure</text>

  <text start="1783.66" dur="5.28">physical attacks and this could be a</text>
  <text start="1786.45" dur="5.43">huge potential false flag and just to</text>
  <text start="1788.94" dur="5.52">remind everyone when I say this could be</text>
  <text start="1791.88" dur="5.39">a false flag and I bring up there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1794.46" dur="5.91">thousand bay over a thousand banks now</text>
  <text start="1797.27" dur="7.99">cyber attack drill coming up in October</text>
  <text start="1800.37" dur="7.74">this month we have the trucker strike</text>
  <text start="1805.26" dur="6.24">going on we have the power grid grill</text>
  <text start="1808.11" dur="5.13">drill going on and when I say potential</text>
  <text start="1811.5" dur="4.14">these what has happened in the past</text>
  <text start="1813.24" dur="5.15">every time some type of false flag</text>
  <text start="1815.64" dur="6.75">happens there&amp;#39;s always a drill that</text>
  <text start="1818.39" dur="7.54">corresponds to the attack we saw this in</text>
  <text start="1822.39" dur="8.16">Boston there was a bomb drill going on</text>
  <text start="1825.93" dur="6.57">we saw this in 911 the Air Force was</text>
  <text start="1830.55" dur="3.33">running a drills that&amp;#39;s why the planes</text>
  <text start="1832.5" dur="4.05">were off someplace else doing something</text>
  <text start="1833.88" dur="5.28">else FEMA was on the ground a day before</text>
  <text start="1836.55" dur="5.31">and we can see this and this is why we</text>
  <text start="1839.16" dur="5.97">call attention to these drills because</text>
  <text start="1841.86" dur="5.18">every time when there&amp;#39;s huge agencies</text>
  <text start="1845.13" dur="6.66">cooperating in something like this</text>
  <text start="1847.04" dur="6.25">something usually goes wrong and most of</text>
  <text start="1851.79" dur="3.06">the time when I think is happening most</text>
  <text start="1853.29" dur="4.16">of the people think that there is a</text>
  <text start="1854.85" dur="6.6">drill and people who are in the inside</text>
  <text start="1857.45" dur="6.16">you know say okay it&amp;#39;s a go let&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="1861.45" dur="3.87">is no longer a drill let&amp;#39;s have the real</text>
  <text start="1863.61" dur="3.36">thing happen but the people who are</text>
  <text start="1865.32" dur="3.6">working there don&amp;#39;t understand that the</text>
  <text start="1866.97" dur="4.4">real thing is happening and it turns out</text>
  <text start="1868.92" dur="5.34">to be real and we see this power grid</text>
  <text start="1871.37" dur="5.26">going down in November</text>
  <text start="1874.26" dur="4.95">there&amp;#39;s fema there there&amp;#39;s DHS their</text>
  <text start="1876.63" dur="4.5">power grids from across the country all</text>
  <text start="1879.21" dur="5.7">the states are cooperating in this and</text>
  <text start="1881.13" dur="7.17">we can see this is a major major thing</text>
  <text start="1884.91" dur="7.94">that could happen they&amp;#39;ve also had the</text>
  <text start="1888.3" dur="7.98">quantum to drill that happened back in</text>
  <text start="1892.85" dur="8.14">july or august i think was july and that</text>
  <text start="1896.28" dur="6.84">was in preparation to to have training</text>
  <text start="1900.99" dur="4.32">if there is a cyber attack on the</text>
  <text start="1903.12" dur="6.12">financial institutions and now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1905.31" dur="8.07">having all of these banks join in with a</text>
  <text start="1909.24" dur="6.48">drill with a cyber attack happening in</text>
  <text start="1913.38" dur="4.41">october so these two things that are</text>
  <text start="1915.72" dur="4.95">happening we can see something major</text>
  <text start="1917.79" dur="6.42">major happening during this time period</text>
  <text start="1920.67" dur="6.36">and especially what just happened in DC</text>
  <text start="1924.21" dur="5.07">I mean from everything that I see and</text>
  <text start="1927.03" dur="4.35">all the reports that I read and people</text>
  <text start="1929.28" dur="4.65">that are submitting to me I see that</text>
  <text start="1931.38" dur="5.16">this completely looked like some type of</text>
  <text start="1933.93" dur="6.9">preparation for something catastrophic</text>
  <text start="1936.54" dur="7.05">to happen and they they are going</text>
  <text start="1940.83" dur="5.7">through and training to make sure they</text>
  <text start="1943.59" dur="5.94">are ready for what is coming and there</text>
  <text start="1946.53" dur="9.84">are many things happening now we see</text>
  <text start="1949.53" dur="12.06">them materializing and like I said the</text>
  <text start="1956.37" dur="8.46">cyber attack the false flag event with a</text>
  <text start="1961.59" dur="5.46">nuke or a chemical weapon type of event</text>
  <text start="1964.83" dur="5.12">happening we can definitely see this</text>
  <text start="1967.05" dur="5.69">happening in the next month or two</text>
  <text start="1969.95" dur="8.71">coming into this late fall early winter</text>
  <text start="1972.74" dur="11.5">the central bankers the Fed had the</text>
  <text start="1978.66" dur="8.01">event ready for Syria that was that</text>
  <text start="1984.24" dur="4.83">didn&amp;#39;t happen so now they&amp;#39;re delayed a</text>
  <text start="1986.67" dur="4.68">little bit they&amp;#39;re regrouping there they</text>
  <text start="1989.07" dur="3.72">their plan is still on the table they</text>
  <text start="1991.35" dur="3.45">know what they have to do they</text>
  <text start="1992.79" dur="4.17">understand the collapse is coming and</text>
  <text start="1994.8" dur="5.7">they understand that they can never ever</text>
  <text start="1996.96" dur="6.33">taper is an impossibility so they are</text>
  <text start="2000.5" dur="4.53">trying to figure out a way and you can</text>
  <text start="2003.29" dur="4.04">see they&amp;#39;re building the propaganda</text>
  <text start="2005.03" dur="4.71">right now the propaganda before</text>
  <text start="2007.33" dur="4.9">the end of the fiscal year was the</text>
  <text start="2009.74" dur="5.85">economy is thriving getting better</text>
  <text start="2012.23" dur="6.81">housing is moving up unemployment&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2015.59" dur="4.62">going down gdp going up this is all an</text>
  <text start="2019.04" dur="3.15">illusion of course because they</text>
  <text start="2020.21" dur="4.26">manipulate all the numbers now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2022.19" dur="4.44">saying because of the shutdown as we go</text>
  <text start="2024.47" dur="4.53">further and further day after day it</text>
  <text start="2026.63" dur="3.78">could have catastrophic events and it</text>
  <text start="2029" dur="3.33">doesn&amp;#39;t look like the economy in the</text>
  <text start="2030.41" dur="4.74">fourth quarter will be able to do as</text>
  <text start="2032.33" dur="4.92">well as they believe that should they</text>
  <text start="2035.15" dur="4.32">also see that housing will start the</text>
  <text start="2037.25" dur="4.08">decline now this has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="2039.47" dur="5.43">the shutdown at this point this has to</text>
  <text start="2041.33" dur="5.22">do with because they knew that all of</text>
  <text start="2044.9" dur="4.259">this was completely fake and you have to</text>
  <text start="2046.55" dur="5.609">remember the Fed pumps up the stock</text>

  <text start="2072.56" dur="3.329">they can just manipulate the numbers of</text>
  <text start="2073.94" dur="3.06">the numbers are manipulated anyhow so</text>
  <text start="2075.889" dur="3.721">what&amp;#39;s the difference why they even</text>
  <text start="2077" dur="4.71">waiting the whole thing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2079.61" dur="3.51">waiting for a certain event to happen</text>
