  <text start="35.54" dur="6.75">episode 990 a and today&amp;#39;s date is jun 6</text>
  <text start="39.1" dur="6.45">2016 and the top of the episode is the</text>
  <text start="42.29" dur="5.97">crash of all crashes is headed our way</text>
  <text start="45.55" dur="5.53">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="48.26" dur="4.92">financial news now we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="51.08" dur="4.32">the job numbers since Friday as they</text>
  <text start="53.18" dur="5.19">came out and we&amp;#39;re realizing that these</text>
  <text start="55.4" dur="8.45">job numbers they are absolutely horrific</text>
  <text start="58.37" dur="9.6">and when we look at the information</text>
  <text start="63.85" dur="7.38">nearly 4.5 million service jobs they</text>
  <text start="67.97" dur="5.85">were created and virtually no</text>
  <text start="71.23" dur="5.95">manufacturing jobs were created during</text>
  <text start="73.82" dur="7.05">this time period and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="77.18" dur="6.479">economy and we look at the jobs we see</text>
  <text start="80.87" dur="5.31">that eighty-six percent of total US</text>
  <text start="83.659" dur="5.701">employment well that&amp;#39;s in the service</text>
  <text start="86.18" dur="5.76">industry and only fourteen percent of us</text>
  <text start="89.36" dur="4.43">jobs are in manufacturing more than</text>
  <text start="91.94" dur="6.179">two-thirds or six to eight percent of</text>
  <text start="93.79" dur="8.399">SNP earnings come from manufacturing</text>
  <text start="98.119" dur="7.86">industries well that&amp;#39;s kind of odd and</text>
  <text start="102.189" dur="7.331">if you really look at this manufacturing</text>
  <text start="105.979" dur="5.28">is important even though the central</text>
  <text start="109.52" dur="4.29">bankers the US government is telling us</text>
  <text start="111.259" dur="6.061">that no it&amp;#39;s not important we are a</text>
  <text start="113.81" dur="6.599">service country well a service country</text>
  <text start="117.32" dur="9.119">cannot continue on you need to produce</text>
  <text start="120.409" dur="7.891">something and they hoped and they prayed</text>
  <text start="126.439" dur="4.951">that the economy would continue to</text>
  <text start="128.3" dur="7.29">expand on the back of the service sector</text>
  <text start="131.39" dur="6.75">alone well they manipulated a lot of the</text>
  <text start="135.59" dur="8.99">data to make it look like the country</text>
  <text start="138.14" dur="6.44">was pushing forward on service alone and</text>
  <text start="144.94" dur="6.76">corporate profits that suggests that</text>
  <text start="148.49" dur="5.76">manufacturing continues to play a much</text>
  <text start="151.7" dur="5.67">more important dynamic than it is giving</text>
  <text start="154.25" dur="5.64">credit for the decline in imports</text>
  <text start="157.37" dur="5.43">surging inventories and weak durable</text>
  <text start="159.89" dur="3.97">goods all are showing that the economy</text>
  <text start="162.8" dur="3.1">is</text>
  <text start="163.86" dur="3.6">then with the corporate media what the</text>
  <text start="165.9" dur="7.25">US government what the central bankers</text>
  <text start="167.46" dur="9.57">are telling us the economy right now it</text>
  <text start="173.15" dur="6.46">is not doing well no matter what the</text>
  <text start="177.03" dur="6.03">stock market is doing no matter what the</text>
  <text start="179.61" dur="6.21">president is saying we are looking at</text>
  <text start="183.06" dur="5.49">the economic indicators and they are</text>
  <text start="185.82" dur="6.81">showing the economy is deteriorating</text>
  <text start="188.55" dur="6.65">very very quickly actually when you look</text>
  <text start="192.63" dur="9.84">at the Fed labor market condition index</text>
  <text start="195.2" dur="10.12">which they created and we take it and we</text>
  <text start="202.47" dur="5.67">expand it over many many years we see</text>
  <text start="205.32" dur="6.419">the lmc I which is the labor market</text>
  <text start="208.14" dur="7.5">conditions index drop to negative 4.8</text>
  <text start="211.739" dur="7.141">and it shows that the you the US labor</text>
  <text start="215.64" dur="10.38">market it&amp;#39;s deteriorating at the fastest</text>
  <text start="218.88" dur="9.18">pace in seven years now their labor</text>
  <text start="226.02" dur="4.26">market condition index is not saying</text>
  <text start="228.06" dur="4.32">that everything is awesome because when</text>
  <text start="230.28" dur="5.16">you look at it and you compare what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="232.38" dur="6.87">happening now to 2008 actually prior to</text>
  <text start="235.44" dur="6.96">2008 back in two thousand seven we are</text>
  <text start="239.25" dur="6.36">now headed down the same exact path</text>
  <text start="242.4" dur="6">because back in that time frame we saw</text>
  <text start="245.61" dur="7.02">that the labor market condition index</text>
  <text start="248.4" dur="8.369">dropped from high numbers like you know</text>
  <text start="252.63" dur="8.13">positive seven positive six in 2007 to</text>
  <text start="256.769" dur="7.861">negative to the negative 3 the negative</text>
  <text start="260.76" dur="7.89">for the negative 6 and it went all the</text>
  <text start="264.63" dur="11.88">way down to like negative 38 here we are</text>
  <text start="268.65" dur="11.31">in 2016 and at the end of 2015 we&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="276.51" dur="6.63">the same exact track where their model</text>
  <text start="279.96" dur="6.03">is showing that we&amp;#39;re at negative 1 then</text>
  <text start="283.14" dur="6.06">dropping to a negative 2 and negative 3</text>
  <text start="285.99" dur="5.88">and here we are a negative 4.8 and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="289.2" dur="6.96">dropping very very quickly and this is</text>
  <text start="291.87" dur="5.61">showing us that the US labor market is</text>
  <text start="296.16" dur="4.23">not getting better at</text>
  <text start="297.48" dur="6.09">all its deteriorating there are more</text>
  <text start="300.39" dur="7.02">layoffs according to challenger gray &amp;amp;</text>
  <text start="303.57" dur="6.44">christmas going back to jun 2014 we are</text>
  <text start="307.41" dur="6.6">over a million layoffs right now</text>
  <text start="310.01" dur="7.21">companies are not hiring those people</text>
  <text start="314.01" dur="5.96">that are laid off they can&amp;#39;t find work</text>
  <text start="317.22" dur="6.72">they&amp;#39;re just falling off the job market</text>
  <text start="319.97" dur="8.29">believe me every person would like to</text>
  <text start="323.94" dur="7.38">have income coming in they would like to</text>
  <text start="328.26" dur="5.31">support their families they would like</text>
  <text start="331.32" dur="4.35">to go on vacations they would like to</text>
  <text start="333.57" dur="6.18">get a new car they would like to put</text>
  <text start="335.67" dur="5.7">food on the table and when they say</text>
  <text start="339.75" dur="6.06">people just don&amp;#39;t care they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="341.37" dur="7.62">to look well that&amp;#39;s very hard to believe</text>
  <text start="345.81" dur="4.8">because when I talk to people and when I</text>
  <text start="348.99" dur="5.94">look around and the emails that i</text>
  <text start="350.61" dur="6.47">receive everyone would like a job but</text>
  <text start="354.93" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s very difficult to find one and</text>
  <text start="357.08" dur="6.1">people are just getting by there it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="359.55" dur="6.45">very difficult and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="363.18" dur="5.94">that this economy that we&amp;#39;re in it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="366" dur="4.97">improving I mean we can listen to the</text>
  <text start="369.12" dur="6">lies all day long from corporate media</text>
  <text start="370.97" dur="6.58">from the president but when we boil down</text>
  <text start="375.12" dur="4.41">to what&amp;#39;s really going on here and we</text>
  <text start="377.55" dur="4.47">look at the indicators and we look at</text>
  <text start="379.53" dur="5.67">what&amp;#39;s going on here we realize that a</text>
  <text start="382.02" dur="5.34">lot of the indicators are the same as</text>
  <text start="385.2" dur="5.55">2008 at this point and there are many</text>
  <text start="387.36" dur="5.4">that are much much worse and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="390.75" dur="4.02">impossible for the economy to be doing</text>
  <text start="392.76" dur="4.65">well the only way that the economy can</text>
  <text start="394.77" dur="4.8">be doing well is if they&amp;#39;ve created</text>
  <text start="397.41" dur="4.17">these bubbles they&amp;#39;ve created an</text>
  <text start="399.57" dur="4.59">illusion to make you think that</text>
  <text start="401.58" dur="4.26">everything is fine listen prior to 2008</text>
  <text start="404.16" dur="4.83">before the entire thing came crashing</text>
  <text start="405.84" dur="4.95">down I would say the majority the people</text>
  <text start="408.99" dur="3.75">thought everything was fine they</text>
  <text start="410.79" dur="4.32">believed that everything was contained</text>
  <text start="412.74" dur="3.69">that the economy was doing well and all</text>
  <text start="415.11" dur="3.36">those people that are out there saying</text>
  <text start="416.43" dur="3.6">no there&amp;#39;s problems we have a credit</text>
  <text start="418.47" dur="3.6">problem we have a surprise problem and</text>
  <text start="420.03" dur="5.07">of course the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="422.07" dur="4.74">government the Fed was all out there</text>
  <text start="425.1" dur="3.66">saying no that&amp;#39;s contained whoo there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="426.81" dur="4.71">no problems whatsoever but we know in</text>
  <text start="428.76" dur="3.869">the background what was happening</text>
  <text start="431.52" dur="5.1">we know that everything was falling</text>
  <text start="432.629" dur="5.16">apart and this is exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="436.62" dur="3.62">happening right now there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="437.789" dur="4.951">difference well there is one difference</text>
  <text start="440.24" dur="5.859">it&amp;#39;s about a hundred times worse at this</text>
  <text start="442.74" dur="6.47">point we see the Baltic Dry Index that</text>
  <text start="446.099" dur="7.981">has fallen by three pointers down to 607</text>
  <text start="449.21" dur="8.59">the Bank of Japan board member takahiro</text>
  <text start="454.08" dur="7.619">Sato well he&amp;#39;s raising concerns about</text>
  <text start="457.8" dur="6.63">the global financial stability and he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="464.43" dur="6.93">economic problems that they have he</text>
  <text start="469.139" dur="5.221">warned that due to the impact of</text>
  <text start="471.36" dur="4.35">negative interest rates he detected a</text>
  <text start="474.36" dur="4.38">vulnerability similar to that seen</text>
  <text start="475.71" dur="6.359">before the so-called value-at-risk shock</text>
  <text start="478.74" dur="5.729">in 2003 and what he&amp;#39;s looking at he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="482.069" dur="5.16">saying that this could affect the</text>
  <text start="484.469" dur="7.861">financial systems resilience again</text>
  <text start="487.229" dur="8.31">shocks in times of stress well this is</text>
  <text start="492.33" dur="6.42">where we&amp;#39;re headed we&amp;#39;re headed to an</text>
  <text start="495.539" dur="6.72">area where there&amp;#39;s going to be a huge</text>
  <text start="498.75" dur="7.139">shock to the system and this shock to</text>
  <text start="502.259" dur="6.391">the system is going to bring down the</text>
  <text start="505.889" dur="5.58">banking sector it&amp;#39;s going to bring down</text>
  <text start="508.65" dur="5.879">the credit sector it&amp;#39;s going to bring</text>
