  <text start="252.06" dur="5.55">many other states that have done this</text>
  <text start="253.14" dur="7.47">already one thing this really does where</text>
  <text start="257.61" dur="5.22">everyone couldn&amp;#39;t find these individuals</text>
  <text start="260.61" dur="7.14">it brings them all to one location and</text>
  <text start="262.83" dur="7.02">now you know exactly where they are if</text>
  <text start="267.75" dur="3.84">you really think about it but you can</text>
  <text start="269.85" dur="6.36">see what they&amp;#39;re trying to do here now</text>
  <text start="271.59" dur="6.54">out in Georgia a federal judge said that</text>
  <text start="276.21" dur="4.94">Georgia must purge around three hundred</text>
  <text start="278.13" dur="5.61">nine thousand names from its voter rolls</text>
  <text start="281.15" dur="4.21">now there are people that are trying to</text>
  <text start="283.74" dur="4.89">stop this they&amp;#39;re saying that these</text>
  <text start="285.36" dur="5.55">individuals they haven&amp;#39;t voted in a very</text>
  <text start="288.63" dur="3.69">very long time and there&amp;#39;s no reason to</text>
  <text start="290.91" dur="2.07">keep their names there because they can</text>
  <text start="292.32" dur="4.47">be used</text>
  <text start="292.98" dur="5.61">to manipulate the votes now of course we</text>
  <text start="296.79" dur="3.9">have individuals that are trying to stop</text>
  <text start="298.59" dur="4.53">this we have fair fight action Stacey</text>
  <text start="300.69" dur="5.4">Abrams she filed an emergency motion to</text>
  <text start="303.12" dur="6.09">stop the purge and this would have</text>
  <text start="306.09" dur="5.7">brought the eligible voters the register</text>
  <text start="309.21" dur="6.36">voters from seven point four million to</text>
  <text start="311.79" dur="5.93">seven point 1 million but they want</text>
  <text start="315.57" dur="5.67">these people to stay on the roster</text>
  <text start="317.72" dur="6.33">because they can use these names later</text>
  <text start="321.24" dur="6.24">on as they manipulate the election</text>
  <text start="324.05" dur="6.34">numbers they&amp;#39;re trying everything they</text>
  <text start="327.48" dur="5.04">possibly can to get around what Trump of</text>
  <text start="330.39" dur="5.79">the Patriots have done but once again</text>
  <text start="332.52" dur="5.31">this is all going to fail and we know</text>
  <text start="336.18" dur="5.16">the deep state they&amp;#39;re pushing their</text>
  <text start="337.83" dur="7.19">agenda as hard as possible today they</text>
  <text start="341.34" dur="6.23">had the fake impeachment rulemaking and</text>
  <text start="345.02" dur="5.38">they&amp;#39;re expected to vote on the</text>
  <text start="347.57" dur="7.36">impeachment with the full house on</text>
  <text start="350.4" dur="8.22">Wednesday and the constituents of these</text>
  <text start="354.93" dur="6.56">individuals they understand that this is</text>
  <text start="358.62" dur="5.73">a fake impeachment there is no crime</text>
  <text start="361.49" dur="6.94">there&amp;#39;s nothing there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="364.35" dur="7.2">telling their government elected</text>
  <text start="368.43" dur="5.61">officials what they think about it and</text>
  <text start="371.55" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s not going well for them remember</text>
  <text start="374.04" dur="3.45">there&amp;#39;s different levels to the swamp</text>
  <text start="376.02" dur="4.4">and there&amp;#39;s different ways to drain it</text>
  <text start="377.49" dur="5.73">if you look at Congress in the Senate</text>
  <text start="380.42" dur="6.28">one way to do it is to expose everything</text>
  <text start="383.22" dur="6.45">they&amp;#39;re really about let the people see</text>
  <text start="386.7" dur="5.58">it firsthand but remember when these</text>
  <text start="389.67" dur="4.44">individuals become desperate they show</text>
  <text start="392.28" dur="3.57">their true colors and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="394.11" dur="4.41">happening Trump the Patriots knew this</text>
  <text start="395.85" dur="6.93">they set them up they wanted everyone to</text>
  <text start="398.52" dur="7.02">see how low they would stoop and what</text>
  <text start="402.78" dur="5.7">they would do to try to remove a duly</text>
  <text start="405.54" dur="6.65">elected president with no crime with</text>
  <text start="408.48" dur="6.62">nothing there and the people are angry</text>
  <text start="412.19" dur="5.74">Don junior tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="415.1" dur="5.08">it&amp;#39;s good to see constituents becoming</text>
  <text start="417.93" dur="4.59">active when partisan Democrats are just</text>
  <text start="420.18" dur="5.64">voting with a party line and not based</text>
  <text start="422.52" dur="6.54">in truth or facts constituents</text>
  <text start="425.82" dur="5.7">Democrat representative slot Kim as she</text>
  <text start="429.06" dur="5.4">tries to explain her support for Pelosi</text>
  <text start="431.52" dur="5.52">impeachment scam people were screaming</text>
  <text start="434.46" dur="5.67">and yelling and she was trying to</text>
  <text start="437.04" dur="5.16">explain but you can&amp;#39;t explain away why</text>
  <text start="440.13" dur="3.84">you&amp;#39;re voting for something when there</text>
  <text start="442.2" dur="3.93">is no crime when there&amp;#39;s no evidence</text>
  <text start="443.97" dur="3.84">when there&amp;#39;s no facts because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="446.13" dur="4.38">what people are gonna throw back at you</text>
  <text start="447.81" dur="6.18">and he can&amp;#39;t explain that away it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="450.51" dur="5.07">impossible now you can see why Trump and</text>
  <text start="453.99" dur="4.2">the Patriots weren&amp;#39;t too worried about</text>
  <text start="455.58" dur="4.2">losing the house they knew that this was</text>
  <text start="458.19" dur="4.11">going to happen they knew they were</text>
  <text start="459.78" dur="5.79">going to push him down this path and</text>
  <text start="462.3" dur="5.88">once they&amp;#39;re exposed well it&amp;#39;s game over</text>
  <text start="465.57" dur="5.04">and it&amp;#39;s really starting to look like</text>
  <text start="468.18" dur="3.92">that and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is we</text>
  <text start="470.61" dur="4.5">always talked about how the Patriots</text>
  <text start="472.1" dur="4.84">need to educate the people before we see</text>
  <text start="475.11" dur="4.56">a rest before we see anything because as</text>
  <text start="476.94" dur="5.07">you can see there are a lot of people</text>
  <text start="479.67" dur="3.9">that are waking up right now and more</text>
  <text start="482.01" dur="4.02">and more people are waking up actually</text>
  <text start="483.57" dur="5.49">there was a poll and the majority of</text>
  <text start="486.03" dur="7.05">Americans now believe the FBI broke the</text>
  <text start="489.06" dur="6.96">law investigating the Trump campaign now</text>
  <text start="493.08" dur="6.42">think about this for a second before the</text>
  <text start="496.02" dur="8.1">IG Pfizer report no one really believed</text>
  <text start="499.5" dur="9.12">that the FBI would spy on Trump that the</text>
  <text start="504.12" dur="8.01">FBI broke any rules the FBI did</text>
  <text start="508.62" dur="6.69">something wrong the IG Pfizer report</text>
  <text start="512.13" dur="7.08">comes out and 53% of the voters believe</text>
  <text start="515.31" dur="5.73">it is at least somewhat likely that the</text>
  <text start="519.21" dur="5.9">FBI broke the law when investigating the</text>
  <text start="521.04" dur="8.7">campaign 22 percent say extremely likely</text>
  <text start="525.11" dur="6.82">14% very likely as you can see the</text>
  <text start="529.74" dur="5.3">people are waking up they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="531.93" dur="6.29">educated on what is really happening and</text>
  <text start="535.04" dur="6.28">as they get more and more information</text>
  <text start="538.22" dur="5.83">they&amp;#39;re gonna start to realize that this</text>
  <text start="541.32" dur="5.13">system has been rigged since the</text>
  <text start="544.05" dur="4.41">beginning and you start out slow you</text>
  <text start="546.45" dur="4.05">give them the facts you give them</text>
  <text start="548.46" dur="4.47">something that has no emotion attached</text>
  <text start="550.5" dur="4.94">to it you just show them look what they</text>
  <text start="552.93" dur="5.58">did here 17 times</text>
  <text start="555.44" dur="3.76">look they knew what they needed to do</text>
  <text start="558.51" dur="3.9">but they</text>
  <text start="559.2" dur="6.21">decided to omit it and this brings</text>
  <text start="562.41" dur="4.92">people into the fold and once more and</text>
  <text start="565.41" dur="5.88">more information comes out they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="567.33" dur="7.14">start to realize that wow they really</text>
  <text start="571.29" dur="5.49">did this to trump then bring in</text>
