  <text start="56.489" dur="4.951">when he to report my name is Dave and</text>
  <text start="58.17" dur="5.879">this is episode 1540 a and today&amp;#39;s date</text>
  <text start="61.44" dur="5.819">is April 9th 2018 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="64.049" dur="6.631">episode is indicators are off the charts</text>
  <text start="67.259" dur="5.911">signaling a recession let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="70.68" dur="4.079">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="73.17" dur="3.629">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about crypto</text>
  <text start="74.759" dur="3.241">currencies the blockchain technology for</text>
  <text start="76.799" dur="2.941">quite a while many people are talking</text>
  <text start="78" dur="4.35">about this and we&amp;#39;ve seen the</text>
  <text start="79.74" dur="5.58">cryptocurrency market take a dive and</text>
  <text start="82.35" dur="4.86">again we have to point to Mount we</text>
  <text start="85.32" dur="4.079">saw the sell-off and we talked about</text>
  <text start="87.21" dur="4.49">this way way back where we said the</text>
  <text start="89.399" dur="6.351">central bankers would make their move to</text>
  <text start="91.7" dur="6.04">basically try to control the blockchain</text>
  <text start="95.75" dur="3.909">system which is completely impossible</text>
  <text start="97.74" dur="5.01">what they can do is they can bring the</text>
  <text start="99.659" dur="6.391">prices up or down by dumping Bitcoin or</text>
  <text start="102.75" dur="5.19">by using the paper market but to fully</text>
  <text start="106.05" dur="3.989">control it it&amp;#39;s going to be completely</text>
  <text start="107.94" dur="3.48">impossible because as we move forward</text>
  <text start="110.039" dur="3.481">everything is going to become more and</text>
  <text start="111.42" dur="4.17">more decentralized regulations are gonna</text>
  <text start="113.52" dur="4.199">be very very very difficult to control</text>
  <text start="115.59" dur="4.319">what they want to do and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="117.719" dur="4.5">centralize it so it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="119.909" dur="3.931">as they brought the cryptocurrency price</text>
  <text start="122.219" dur="3.571">way down and I&amp;#39;m just talking about</text>
  <text start="123.84" dur="4.29">Bitcoin and yes a lot of the other coins</text>
  <text start="125.79" dur="4.77">are associated with this and it looks</text>
  <text start="128.13" dur="6.03">like basically we&amp;#39;re at this point where</text>
  <text start="130.56" dur="6.54">the big money is deciding to come in now</text>
  <text start="134.16" dur="7.02">they understand that the next generation</text>
  <text start="137.1" dur="7.199">of people and States countries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="141.18" dur="5.07">all looking at this as a way of removing</text>
  <text start="144.299" dur="4.171">themselves from the central banking</text>
  <text start="146.25" dur="4.68">system and right now the central banking</text>
  <text start="148.47" dur="6.03">system that is the relic</text>
  <text start="150.93" dur="6.809">they are obsolete there&amp;#39;s no reason in</text>
  <text start="154.5" dur="5.01">today&amp;#39;s world there&amp;#39;s no reason for us</text>
  <text start="157.739" dur="4.921">all to be centralized</text>
  <text start="159.51" dur="7.02">where there&amp;#39;s one body taking care of</text>
  <text start="162.66" dur="6.51">the entire world dictating to every</text>
  <text start="166.53" dur="4.739">single country by loaning them funds</text>
  <text start="169.17" dur="4.05">with interest attached and putting them</text>
  <text start="171.269" dur="4.231">into debt so they can control them</text>
  <text start="173.22" dur="4.739">there&amp;#39;s no reason for this anymore and</text>
  <text start="175.5" dur="5.48">what we&amp;#39;re starting to see is a lot of</text>
  <text start="177.959" dur="5.7">these funds that are controlled by soros</text>
  <text start="180.98" dur="5.42">controlled by the Rockefellers</text>
  <text start="183.659" dur="5.951">controlled by the raw</text>
  <text start="186.4" dur="4.86">a lot of their investment funds well it</text>
  <text start="189.61" dur="2.849">looks like they&amp;#39;re starting to get into</text>
  <text start="191.26" dur="3.12">cryptocurrency and it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="192.459" dur="4.651">that they&amp;#39;re entering the crypto market</text>
  <text start="194.38" dur="5.4">when Bitcoin is down more than 60% it</text>
  <text start="197.11" dur="3.989">theory M is down more than 70% because</text>
  <text start="199.78" dur="2.97">it looks like this might have been</text>
  <text start="201.099" dur="3.39">orchestrated so they can get into the</text>
  <text start="202.75" dur="2.97">market now you know they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="204.489" dur="3.691">get into the market when it&amp;#39;s at its</text>
  <text start="205.72" dur="5.88">height now we need to understand that</text>
  <text start="208.18" dur="5.639">the crypto market is just like the</text>
  <text start="211.6" dur="4.38">Internet in the early stages where</text>
  <text start="213.819" dur="4.081">people are questioning they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="215.98" dur="5.07">understand what it is a lot of people</text>
  <text start="217.9" dur="5.55">don&amp;#39;t know what it is and everyone needs</text>
  <text start="221.05" dur="4.439">to start to learn and understand what</text>
  <text start="223.45" dur="4.319">the blockchain system is what crypto</text>
  <text start="225.489" dur="4.681">currencies are and how powerful it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="227.769" dur="5.011">going to be think about it if you knew</text>
  <text start="230.17" dur="4.74">and understood what the internet was</text>
  <text start="232.78" dur="4.14">going to be today well a lot of people</text>
  <text start="234.91" dur="5.4">would be very very wealthy think about</text>
  <text start="236.92" dur="6.21">if you knew back then that domain names</text>
  <text start="240.31" dur="4.32">were going to be so important you would</text>
  <text start="243.13" dur="3">have won at you would have gone out and</text>
  <text start="244.63" dur="2.669">you would have purchased almost every</text>
  <text start="246.13" dur="3.72">single domain name that you could have</text>
  <text start="247.299" dur="3.931">fine so when these big corporations</text>
  <text start="249.85" dur="3.27">wanted to get their domain name you</text>
  <text start="251.23" dur="3.81">would have sold them at ten thousand a</text>
  <text start="253.12" dur="4.2">pop a hundred thousand dollars a pop the</text>
  <text start="255.04" dur="4.8">same thing with cryptocurrency today you</text>

  <text start="323.43" dur="6.63">which is new its upcoming and I believe</text>
  <text start="327.36" dur="6.54">we&amp;#39;ll be transitioning into a crypto</text>
  <text start="330.06" dur="6.87">type of currency scenario and we see</text>
  <text start="333.9" dur="5.31">that Russia China and many other</text>
  <text start="336.93" dur="5.91">countries are headed in this direction</text>
  <text start="339.21" dur="6">and during the interview I think it was</text>
  <text start="342.84" dur="7.38">crypto Z who even mentioned that China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="345.21" dur="7.92">building a city around a crypto currency</text>

  <text start="356.729" dur="6.211">what is happening today we are in the</text>
  <text start="359.94" dur="5.759">middle of a transition it is happening</text>
  <text start="362.94" dur="4.47">right now and it&amp;#39;s happening at</text>
  <text start="365.699" dur="4.5">lightning speed and if you want to go</text>
  <text start="367.41" dur="4.979">over to the crypto school and stuff it</text>

  <text start="381.15" dur="5.82">entering brand new times here the</text>
  <text start="384.419" dur="4.741">economy is breaking down at a rapid pace</text>
  <text start="386.97" dur="4.71">and we&amp;#39;re gonna be heading into a</text>
  <text start="389.16" dur="5.819">transition just like we transitioned off</text>
  <text start="391.68" dur="5.58">the gold standard back in the 70s on to</text>
  <text start="394.979" dur="4.201">the petro dollar now did you have to</text>
  <text start="397.26" dur="3.659">learn anything back then did you have to</text>
  <text start="399.18" dur="3.239">know how to spend your currency</text>
  <text start="400.919" dur="3.81">differently no you didn&amp;#39;t have to know</text>
  <text start="402.419" dur="5.22">any of that today it&amp;#39;s very different</text>
  <text start="404.729" dur="5.791">because of technology it allows us</text>
  <text start="407.639" dur="5.821">finally it allows us to move away from</text>
  <text start="410.52" dur="5.76">the central banking system and it allows</text>
  <text start="413.46" dur="5.28">us for the first time where they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="416.28" dur="5.669">control what we&amp;#39;re doing because of</text>
  <text start="418.74" dur="4.62">decentralization yes gold they were able</text>
  <text start="421.949" dur="2.881">to control because they could say we can</text>
  <text start="423.36" dur="3.989">we&amp;#39;re gonna take you off the gold</text>
  <text start="424.83" dur="5.01">standard because of speculators but they</text>
  <text start="427.349" dur="4.591">can&amp;#39;t take you off decentralization to</text>
  <text start="429.84" dur="4.59">go to centralization that would be</text>
  <text start="431.94" dur="6.06">pretty darn difficult so we are headed</text>
  <text start="434.43" dur="5.37">into this new realm and it&amp;#39;s approaching</text>
  <text start="438" dur="4.289">very very quickly I mean we&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="439.8" dur="4.92">through crypto currencies 1-hour the</text>
  <text start="442.289" dur="4.551">blockchain 1.0 2.0 we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="444.72" dur="5.1">heading to 3.0 where we have</text>
  <text start="446.84" dur="4.96">decentralized exchanges and it&amp;#39;s moving</text>
  <text start="449.82" dur="3.33">very very quickly we see here in the</text>

  <text start="453.15" dur="4.44">subprime auto implosion while it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="455.4" dur="5.16">full effect right now and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="457.59" dur="5.58">seeing right now is the smaller subprime</text>
  <text start="460.56" dur="4.5">auto lenders are starting to implode and</text>
  <text start="463.17" dur="3.99">we all know what comes next the larger</text>
  <text start="465.06" dur="4.98">companies go bust and this reads minds</text>
  <text start="467.16" dur="4.65">me of the retail apocalypse where we</text>
  <text start="470.04" dur="4.05">started to see a couple of stores then</text>
  <text start="471.81" dur="4.05">more stores declared bankruptcy a lot</text>
  <text start="474.09" dur="4.29">more stores started to close we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="513.87" dur="3.48">bankruptcy also they&amp;#39;re winding down</text>
  <text start="515.67" dur="3.87">their business now when we look at the</text>
  <text start="517.35" dur="5.01">delinquencies we can see that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="519.54" dur="7.38">almost at the same exact point where we</text>
  <text start="522.36" dur="7.35">were back in 2008 back in 2008 we hit</text>
  <text start="526.92" dur="5.07">around something like ten percent or so</text>
  <text start="529.71" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;re almost up to eight percent now if</text>
  <text start="531.99" dur="4.71">we go prior to 2008 because 2008 was the</text>
  <text start="535.05" dur="4.37">beginning of the Great Recession if we</text>

  <text start="539.42" dur="6.04">2007 well that&amp;#39;s where we are right now</text>
  <text start="542.79" dur="6.33">so we&amp;#39;re almost at the same exact point</text>
  <text start="545.46" dur="8.04">for delinquencies that we were at during</text>
  <text start="549.12" dur="7.65">the year of 2007 late 2007 going into</text>

  <text start="559.32" dur="7.2">sense no we also know there&amp;#39;s a tsunami</text>
  <text start="563.61" dur="5.4">of lease returns which will basically</text>
  <text start="566.52" dur="6.33">lead to a shock of repricing for both</text>

  <text start="670.41" dur="5.91">plan all along and right now everything</text>
  <text start="673.68" dur="5.85">is being turned upside down as we know</text>
  <text start="676.32" dur="4.95">TPP was cancelled NAFTA it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="679.53" dur="3.51">renegotiated doesn&amp;#39;t look like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="681.27" dur="3.36">going that well but we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="683.04" dur="3.72">what comes out of that I know it Trump</text>
  <text start="684.63" dur="3.66">wants to get rid of it completely we see</text>
  <text start="686.76" dur="4.14">the deep state is having major major</text>

  <text start="690.9" dur="4.68">control the situation we&amp;#39;ll talk about</text>
  <text start="693.33" dur="5.28">that in a little bit but we also see</text>
  <text start="695.58" dur="6.27">that we have been looking at and and</text>
  <text start="698.61" dur="5.82">seeing a lot of market indicators a lot</text>
  <text start="701.85" dur="6">of economic indicators and here we are</text>
  <text start="704.43" dur="5.85">today where there&amp;#39;s another indicator</text>
  <text start="707.85" dur="5.97">which is the markets message indicator</text>
  <text start="710.28" dur="5.91">and it looks like it&amp;#39;s signaling proceed</text>
  <text start="713.82" dur="6.21">with caution and every time we get this</text>
  <text start="716.19" dur="6.78">it looks like we enter a recession now</text>
  <text start="720.03" dur="6.63">the market message indicator is near the</text>
  <text start="722.97" dur="6.78">peaks of 2000 and 2007 what does that</text>
  <text start="726.66" dur="6.15">tell us it tells us if we look back in</text>
  <text start="729.75" dur="5.79">history we entered a recession here we</text>
  <text start="732.81" dur="5.42">are today where we&amp;#39;re at that same peak</text>
  <text start="735.54" dur="6.45">and if we go back in time and we look at</text>
  <text start="738.23" dur="7.6">2008 we hit the peak of about one point</text>
  <text start="741.99" dur="6.48">six five we are now at one point six if</text>
  <text start="745.83" dur="6.78">we go back to 2000 we were at one point</text>
  <text start="748.47" dur="7.32">six if we go back to 1997 we&amp;#39;re at one</text>
  <text start="752.61" dur="6.98">point five five every time we hit this</text>
  <text start="755.79" dur="6.42">peak we enter some type of economic</text>
  <text start="759.59" dur="5.17">downturn and what is perhaps most</text>
  <text start="762.21" dur="5.25">worrisome is the recent chaos in the</text>
  <text start="764.76" dur="5.13">stock market and this is warning us</text>
  <text start="767.46" dur="4.77">proceed with caution which means</text>
  <text start="769.89" dur="4.47">something is on its way and we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="772.23" dur="4.98">many of these indicators we&amp;#39;ve gone over</text>
  <text start="774.36" dur="5.61">them time and time again showing that we</text>
  <text start="777.21" dur="5.15">are in a recession and I really do</text>
  <text start="779.97" dur="7.68">believe that the recession started in</text>
  <text start="782.36" dur="7.33">2016 late 2016 and all throughout 2017</text>
  <text start="787.65" dur="4.59">were in a recession but the central</text>
  <text start="789.69" dur="4.95">bankers and those in government have</text>
  <text start="792.24" dur="6.12">gotten really really good at</text>
  <text start="794.64" dur="6.48">manipulating the numbers they&amp;#39;ve learned</text>
  <text start="798.36" dur="6.12">how to keep the stock market alive they</text>
  <text start="801.12" dur="6.15">have the ability now to push and pump</text>
  <text start="804.48" dur="5.7">stimulus into the economy to keep the</text>
  <text start="807.27" dur="5.39">banks afloat they have learned from the</text>
  <text start="810.18" dur="4.71">past on how to keep everything</text>
  <text start="812.66" dur="7.42">operational think about it when we were</text>
  <text start="814.89" dur="7.65">in recessions during 2000 1997 and going</text>
  <text start="820.08" dur="6.33">back to all the other dates they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="822.54" dur="7.2">pumping in stimulus so each time they</text>
  <text start="826.41" dur="5.19">were able to pump the economy back or</text>
  <text start="829.74" dur="4.29">the economy improved and then the</text>
  <text start="831.6" dur="4.65">economy would fall again and this was</text>
  <text start="834.03" dur="4.14">like a seven-year cycle they were able</text>
  <text start="836.25" dur="5.88">to keep us going a lot longer this time</text>
  <text start="838.17" dur="7.08">because they added on the ability to</text>
  <text start="842.13" dur="6.09">create more and more currency now when</text>
  <text start="845.25" dur="5.88">this happens this indicates this is the</text>
  <text start="848.22" dur="4.5">endgame and they keep doing this until</text>
  <text start="851.13" dur="2.71">the very end this is why we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="852.72" dur="3.07">seeing the cycle</text>
  <text start="853.84" dur="3.45">everyone was calling for the cycle</text>
  <text start="855.79" dur="3.39">because you know this is what you got</text>
  <text start="857.29" dur="4.35">used to over the many many years where</text>
  <text start="859.18" dur="5.25">yes they&amp;#39;ve done this before seven years</text>
  <text start="861.64" dur="5.61">or so boom we have a cycle we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="864.43" dur="4.56">recession boom the economy improves then</text>
  <text start="867.25" dur="4.47">seven years later it happens again at</text>
  <text start="868.99" dur="5.34">the endgame there is no more cycles</text>
  <text start="871.72" dur="5.7">that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s the endgame what they do</text>
  <text start="874.33" dur="5.16">is they go all out which is creating as</text>
  <text start="877.42" dur="4.2">much currency as possible what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="879.49" dur="4.62">done here is they make sure that this</text>
  <text start="881.62" dur="4.92">currency didn&amp;#39;t hit the public arena</text>
  <text start="884.11" dur="5.76">they made sure that it went directly</text>
  <text start="886.54" dur="6.51">into what real estate into the stock</text>
  <text start="889.87" dur="6.57">market into the banking system overseas</text>
  <text start="893.05" dur="5.37">into loans for students for automobiles</text>
  <text start="896.44" dur="4.98">they made sure that all this currency</text>
  <text start="898.42" dur="4.86">went in other directions kept it out of</text>
  <text start="901.42" dur="4.38">the public because that would devalue</text>
  <text start="903.28" dur="5.69">the dollar very very quickly so during</text>
  <text start="905.8" dur="7.92">the end stage they have the ability to</text>
  <text start="908.97" dur="7.12">extend the last cycle because what they</text>
  <text start="913.72" dur="3.36">do is they prepare the economy and this</text>
  <text start="916.09" dur="3.09">is what the central bankers were</text>
  <text start="917.08" dur="5.07">preparing for they were preparing to</text>
  <text start="919.18" dur="5.28">move us to a new system and they were</text>
  <text start="922.15" dur="4.65">gonna do this through major events bring</text>
  <text start="924.46" dur="4.61">us to war because war is a great way to</text>
  <text start="926.8" dur="6.33">create chaos to make everyone believe</text>
  <text start="929.07" dur="6.52">that you have to scrimp save and you can</text>
  <text start="933.13" dur="5.07">place austerity on the people and you</text>
  <text start="935.59" dur="4.29">can make people say okay yes I will give</text>
  <text start="938.2" dur="3.21">all this up because I know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="939.88" dur="4.62">happening on the other side of the</text>
  <text start="941.41" dur="5.58">planet or here and I have no problem</text>
  <text start="944.5" dur="4.77">with it the problem is that this didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="946.99" dur="4.71">happen now they&amp;#39;re stuck there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="949.27" dur="3.9">major event where they can point the</text>
  <text start="951.7" dur="3.3">finger of why this is happening and</text>
  <text start="953.17" dur="3.66">eventually what was going to happen the</text>
  <text start="955" dur="5.34">population would decrease after the war</text>
  <text start="956.83" dur="5.4">they would have the system all in place</text>
  <text start="960.34" dur="4.77">to go and it was going to be in China</text>
  <text start="962.23" dur="6.12">and they would say okay we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="965.11" dur="5.25">restart the system and basically what</text>
  <text start="968.35" dur="5.31">that means is we will use gold as</text>
  <text start="970.36" dur="5.25">confidence and the central banking the</text>
  <text start="973.66" dur="4.92">central banks of central banks will</text>
  <text start="975.61" dur="6.39">handle the new system and we will start</text>
  <text start="978.58" dur="6.39">loaning governments to rebuild remember</text>
  <text start="982" dur="5.63">they make the money during the event</text>
  <text start="984.97" dur="4.55">they also make the money during the</text>
  <text start="987.63" dur="4.53">rebuild so the central bankers never</text>
  <text start="989.52" dur="4.62">lose out and it really works for them</text>
  <text start="992.16" dur="3.63">because they&amp;#39;re they were able to reduce</text>
  <text start="994.14" dur="3.93">the population why do they need the</text>
  <text start="995.79" dur="5.28">population reduce because they need a</text>
  <text start="998.07" dur="5.76">new population to grow along with their</text>
  <text start="1001.07" dur="4.68">system so as the population grows more</text>
  <text start="1003.83" dur="3.69">people need loans more people need and</text>
  <text start="1005.75" dur="4.17">they start off with a small base and</text>
  <text start="1007.52" dur="4.02">they build it up and again they run into</text>
  <text start="1009.92" dur="4.2">the same problem and then you like this</text>
  <text start="1011.54" dur="3.93">base to grow over 40 to 45 years that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1014.12" dur="4.02">how long it takes they figured all this</text>
  <text start="1015.47" dur="5.34">out already and we see right now that</text>
  <text start="1018.14" dur="4.44">there&amp;#39;s a hiccup in the plan and Trump</text>
  <text start="1020.81" dur="3.779">got elected he&amp;#39;s going after the deep</text>
  <text start="1022.58" dur="4.17">state going after the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1024.589" dur="4.441">and this is a major problem and this is</text>
  <text start="1026.75" dur="4.05">why there&amp;#39;s a fight to see who will</text>
  <text start="1029.03" dur="3.929">control the narrative because whoever</text>
  <text start="1030.8" dur="4.05">controls the narrative is the loser just</text>
  <text start="1032.959" dur="3.901">like in a war then you can bring out</text>
  <text start="1034.85" dur="4.17">this is why all of this has been</text>
  <text start="1036.86" dur="4.77">happening you can then order the Fed you</text>
  <text start="1039.02" dur="5.16">can do many many things at this point to</text>
