  <text start="115.84" dur="5.25">starting to make their move in trying</text>
  <text start="118.72" dur="7.319">all different tactics to get a war</text>
  <text start="121.09" dur="8.04">started we also see that the CIA is</text>
  <text start="126.039" dur="7.381">being implicated in a report where they</text>
  <text start="129.13" dur="6.15">paid for the Trump sex tape and we can</text>
  <text start="133.42" dur="4.77">see that the intercept came out with</text>
  <text start="135.28" dur="5.28">this report and New York Times alleging</text>
  <text start="138.19" dur="4.83">that the American spies paid a Russian</text>
  <text start="140.56" dur="4.59">operative 100 thousand dollars last</text>
  <text start="143.02" dur="4.53">September for what they were told were</text>
  <text start="145.15" dur="5.25">stolen NSA cyber weapons and videotapes</text>
  <text start="147.55" dur="6.99">of Trump engaged with prostitutes in</text>
  <text start="150.4" dur="5.669">Moscow hotel room now the CIA is saying</text>
  <text start="154.54" dur="3.18">that this is completely made-up because</text>
  <text start="156.069" dur="3.75">what&amp;#39;s happening right now is the</text>
  <text start="157.72" dur="3.78">intelligent agencies are being caught up</text>
  <text start="159.819" dur="5.491">in all of this where they were</text>
  <text start="161.5" dur="5.97">conspiring to push this agenda and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="165.31" dur="3.509">starting to see that everyone&amp;#39;s starting</text>
  <text start="167.47" dur="2.97">to get a little nervous here because a</text>
  <text start="168.819" dur="3.241">lot of the information and the truth is</text>
  <text start="170.44" dur="2.76">starting to come out actually Trump came</text>
  <text start="172.06" dur="4.92">out and said according to the New York</text>
  <text start="173.2" dur="6">Times a Russian sold phony secrets on</text>
  <text start="176.98" dur="4.56">Trump to the u.s. asking price of 10</text>
  <text start="179.2" dur="4.41">million brought down to 1 million to be</text>
  <text start="181.54" dur="3.45">paid over time I hope people are now</text>
  <text start="183.61" dur="3.63">seeing and understanding what is going</text>
  <text start="184.99" dur="5.28">on here it is all now starting</text>
  <text start="187.24" dur="5.22">to come out drain the swamp and we see</text>
  <text start="190.27" dur="4.35">that this is exactly what&amp;#39;s happening we</text>
  <text start="192.46" dur="4.14">see individuals are starting to resign</text>
  <text start="194.62" dur="4.68">because they realize they don&amp;#39;t to be</text>
  <text start="196.6" dur="4.26">caught up in all of this stuff and we</text>
  <text start="199.3" dur="4.47">see that everything&amp;#39;s starting to break</text>
  <text start="200.86" dur="4.62">down now The Times reported that the NSA</text>
  <text start="203.77" dur="3.84">cyber weapons were designed to hack into</text>
  <text start="205.48" dur="4.83">Russian and Chinese computer networks</text>
  <text start="207.61" dur="4.56">but wound up in the hands of how can be</text>
  <text start="210.31" dur="4.53">of a hacking collective known as the</text>
  <text start="212.17" dur="4.26">shadow brokers hackers have reportedly</text>
  <text start="214.84" dur="3.54">used the tool to crack into networks</text>
  <text start="216.43" dur="4.77">around the world including businesses</text>
  <text start="218.38" dur="7.17">hospitals and factories and once again</text>
  <text start="221.2" dur="7.02">these weapons are created by the CIA the</text>
  <text start="225.55" dur="4.68">CIA has been using these weapons they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="228.22" dur="4.68">the ones who&amp;#39;ve been hacking into a lot</text>
  <text start="230.23" dur="5.61">of this stuff here they might have given</text>
  <text start="232.9" dur="5.88">it to other hackers to be used but we</text>
  <text start="235.84" dur="6.03">can see it all revolves around them</text>
  <text start="238.78" dur="4.59">now with the FISA memo it looks like the</text>
  <text start="241.87" dur="4.29">Democrats came out and they created</text>
  <text start="243.37" dur="5.97">their own memo and Trump has declined to</text>
  <text start="246.16" dur="5.37">declassify the memo citing the</text>
  <text start="249.34" dur="4.68">Department of Justice and FBI objects to</text>
  <text start="251.53" dur="4.92">it now what I think they&amp;#39;ve done here</text>
  <text start="254.02" dur="6.66">and they created this memo the Democrats</text>
  <text start="256.45" dur="8.22">and they put in a lot of intelligence</text>
  <text start="260.68" dur="5.04">information where that is classified and</text>
  <text start="264.67" dur="4.23">they knew they were doing this on</text>
  <text start="265.72" dur="7.38">purpose so Trump had no alternative but</text>
  <text start="268.9" dur="6.63">to reject this and have those individual</text>
  <text start="273.1" dur="4.05">parts taken out and they wanted to play</text>
  <text start="275.53" dur="5.67">this up in the corporate media to say</text>
  <text start="277.15" dur="6.39">see Trump Declassified the FISA memo let</text>
  <text start="281.2" dur="5.49">that out but the memo that we put out</text>
  <text start="283.54" dur="5.61">look he wouldn&amp;#39;t allow it out there and</text>
  <text start="286.69" dur="4.44">basically he&amp;#39;s telling them just take</text>
  <text start="289.15" dur="4.71">this little part out because the</text>
  <text start="291.13" dur="5.25">Department of Justice and FBI objects to</text>
  <text start="293.86" dur="5.07">it then we can release the memo and I</text>
  <text start="296.38" dur="4.95">think they done this on purpose so the</text>
  <text start="298.93" dur="4.71">corporate media picks it up people think</text>
  <text start="301.33" dur="4.29">that he&amp;#39;s holding back but this is not</text>
  <text start="303.64" dur="3.81">what is happening at all now we know out</text>
  <text start="305.62" dur="3.06">in the Middle East Afghanistan and all</text>
  <text start="307.45" dur="4.05">these different countries where we had</text>
  <text start="308.68" dur="4.92">regime change the deep state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="311.5" dur="5.19">losing their grip in all these different</text>
  <text start="313.6" dur="4.59">areas and what what&amp;#39;s happening out in</text>
  <text start="316.69" dur="4.42">Afghanistan right now we understand that</text>
  <text start="318.19" dur="4.83">Trump he&amp;#39;s closed the routes</text>
  <text start="321.11" dur="4.08">coming from Pakistan into Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="323.02" dur="5.38">this is where the Islamic state were</text>
  <text start="325.19" dur="5.37">using these routes to supply weapons and</text>
  <text start="328.4" dur="3.96">other things in Afghanistan the US</text>
  <text start="330.56" dur="4.35">troops were using these routes to get</text>
  <text start="332.36" dur="4.74">supplies in and this was all being shut</text>
  <text start="334.91" dur="4.259">down these routes were really being used</text>
  <text start="337.1" dur="4.62">by the intelligence agencies they were</text>
  <text start="339.169" dur="5.401">being used to supplying fund that paid</text>
  <text start="341.72" dur="6.539">mercenaries the terrorist groups and we</text>
  <text start="344.57" dur="6">see right now that Russia well they</text>
  <text start="348.259" dur="6.241">pretty much did an unexpected move in</text>
  <text start="350.57" dur="8.61">Afghanistan which really put the deep</text>
  <text start="354.5" dur="8.699">state in a corner here and Moscow right</text>
  <text start="359.18" dur="8.239">now they are pushing the idea of peace</text>
  <text start="363.199" dur="8.011">they have the Taliban they have the</text>
  <text start="367.419" dur="5.951">government in Afghanistan talking to</text>
  <text start="371.21" dur="4.17">each other now basically what this is</text>
  <text start="373.37" dur="4.29">going to do it&amp;#39;s going to allow the</text>
  <text start="375.38" dur="5.009">Taliban to sit down at the negotiating</text>
  <text start="377.66" dur="6.99">table and enter perhaps a coalition</text>
  <text start="380.389" dur="7.051">government now the corporate media they</text>
  <text start="384.65" dur="6.269">pretty much set their agenda to say</text>
  <text start="387.44" dur="6.509">Russia is supporting the Taliban this is</text>
  <text start="390.919" dur="4.981">what they were using while Russia was</text>
  <text start="393.949" dur="3.391">trying to get the Taliban and the</text>
  <text start="395.9" dur="3.78">government of Afghanistan to sit</text>
  <text start="397.34" dur="4.139">together at the negotiating table and</text>
  <text start="399.68" dur="4.32">the corporate media was out there trying</text>
  <text start="401.479" dur="4.41">to convince everyone that they were</text>
  <text start="404" dur="3.93">working with the Taliban supporting the</text>
  <text start="405.889" dur="4.141">Taliban giving them weapons and all this</text>
  <text start="407.93" dur="4.62">type of nonsense but what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="410.03" dur="5.34">happening right now is that in December</text>
  <text start="412.55" dur="5.22">of 2017 during the negotiations in Oslo</text>
  <text start="415.37" dur="4.25">the Russian side managed to reach an</text>
  <text start="417.77" dur="4.53">agreement with the representatives of</text>
  <text start="419.62" dur="5.979">Afghanistan the United States and the EU</text>
  <text start="422.3" dur="6.899">on relaunching negotiation process Kabul</text>
  <text start="425.599" dur="5.13">gave Moscow a road map they see fit for</text>
  <text start="429.199" dur="3.541">the peace process which should be</text>
  <text start="430.729" dur="5.31">approved by Russia in mid-february of</text>
  <text start="432.74" dur="5.58">2018 if the negotiation process is</text>
  <text start="436.039" dur="4.921">launched in 2018 then there is hope to</text>
  <text start="438.32" dur="5.25">create a stable alliance of legal</text>
  <text start="440.96" dur="4.62">political elites of Afghanistan and that</text>
  <text start="443.57" dur="3.51">part of the Taliban that does not</text>
  <text start="445.58" dur="4.29">support the idea of expansion under</text>
  <text start="447.08" dur="4.079">jihadist flags these joint forces could</text>
  <text start="449.87" dur="3.45">try with general support of all</text>
  <text start="451.159" dur="3.53">countries in the region to eradicate the</text>
  <text start="453.32" dur="3.439">Islamic state and</text>
  <text start="454.689" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re radical groups and form a</text>
  <text start="456.759" dur="5.49">government and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="459.489" dur="4.29">trying to do right now and this is a</text>
  <text start="462.249" dur="4.44">problem once again for the deep state</text>
  <text start="463.779" dur="6.45">another problem is North Korea we have</text>
  <text start="466.689" dur="5.61">the Olympics going on right now north</text>
  <text start="470.229" dur="5.22">korea has joined in on the Olympics and</text>
  <text start="472.299" dur="6.18">the North Korean leader Kim jong-un now</text>
  <text start="475.449" dur="5.58">has invited moon jae-in who is the</text>
  <text start="478.479" dur="6.09">president of South Korea up to North</text>
  <text start="481.029" dur="6.69">Korea to visit with him they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="484.569" dur="6.3">the peace process now during the</text>
  <text start="487.719" dur="6.69">Olympics here it looks like there was a</text>
  <text start="490.869" dur="5.37">cyber attack where we see the Olympic</text>
  <text start="494.409" dur="4.02">web presence stopped functioning</text>
  <text start="496.239" dur="5.311">users could not access pages or print</text>
  <text start="498.429" dur="4.44">even event tickets and everyone was</text>
  <text start="501.55" dur="3.329">saying oh it&amp;#39;s North Korean oh it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="502.869" dur="4.38">Russia because Russia they were banned</text>
  <text start="504.879" dur="4.231">and all this stuff and we see that South</text>
  <text start="507.249" dur="3.72">Korea kind of shut down the false</text>
  <text start="509.11" dur="3.899">allegations about Russia and North Korea</text>
  <text start="510.969" dur="5.04">they really don&amp;#39;t know where the cyber</text>
  <text start="513.009" dur="4.801">attacks came from I have some ideas most</text>
  <text start="516.009" dur="3.66">likely a deep State trying to kick</text>
  <text start="517.81" dur="5.129">something off trying to push their</text>
  <text start="519.669" dur="5.371">agenda but that really didn&amp;#39;t happen we</text>
  <text start="522.939" dur="4.801">see Russia is out there saying listen we</text>
  <text start="525.04" dur="5.159">could sell the s400 missile system to</text>
  <text start="527.74" dur="5.37">any country that feels insecure now if</text>
  <text start="530.199" dur="5.82">the US and they mention this if the US</text>
  <text start="533.11" dur="4.26">would like to purchase RS 400 because</text>
  <text start="536.019" dur="2.731">they&amp;#39;re afraid of North Korea launching</text>
  <text start="537.37" dur="4.439">a missile attack or something like that</text>
  <text start="538.75" dur="6.389">we could sell them the s400 and it would</text>
  <text start="541.809" dur="5.991">basically seal their entire airspace and</text>
  <text start="545.139" dur="4.74">protect them from any type of an attack</text>
  <text start="547.8" dur="6.49">that&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="549.879" dur="6.57">we see already that the Kurds they</text>
  <text start="554.29" dur="6.229">received MANPADS</text>
  <text start="556.449" dur="8.07">from the US and they received these</text>
  <text start="560.519" dur="7.151">manpads a month earlier under the</text>
  <text start="564.519" dur="6.12">agreement between Washington and the YPG</text>
  <text start="567.67" dur="4.919">and the manpads have been delivered to</text>
  <text start="570.639" dur="4.711">the Kurds in the northwestern part of</text>
  <text start="572.589" dur="6.511">Syria near the town of Afrin now we</text>
  <text start="575.35" dur="7.709">understand that manpads were used to</text>
  <text start="579.1" dur="7.979">bring down a Russian jet we know they</text>
  <text start="583.059" dur="5.461">were supplied to the Kurds and we need</text>
  <text start="587.079" dur="3.961">to understand if</text>
  <text start="588.52" dur="4.95">they were supplying these man pads to</text>
  <text start="591.04" dur="5.25">fight the Islamic state why did we</text>
  <text start="593.47" dur="5.19">supply manpads the Islamic state has no</text>
  <text start="596.29" dur="5.7">air force so what would be the purpose</text>
  <text start="598.66" dur="5.73">of supplying MANPADS well it the purpose</text>
  <text start="601.99" dur="3.86">was because they weren&amp;#39;t gonna fight the</text>
  <text start="604.39" dur="4.86">Islamic state they&amp;#39;re going to flight</text>
  <text start="605.85" dur="5.62">Syria Russia trying to get something</text>
  <text start="609.25" dur="4.77">started and we can see right now this is</text>
  <text start="611.47" dur="4.59">exactly what is happening out there we</text>
  <text start="614.02" dur="5.55">see Israel they&amp;#39;ve carried out</text>
  <text start="616.06" dur="6.81">large-scale attacks on Syria and we see</text>
  <text start="619.57" dur="6.57">that Syria has downed an Israeli f-16</text>
  <text start="622.87" dur="4.98">fighter jet now of course Israel is</text>
  <text start="626.14" dur="4.14">saying we have every right to fly into</text>
  <text start="627.85" dur="4.62">Syria and take out any targets that we</text>
  <text start="630.28" dur="4.56">want but Syria does not have the right</text>
  <text start="632.47" dur="6.18">to shoot down our jets really so if</text>
  <text start="634.84" dur="5.31">Syria flew their jets into Israel Israel</text>
  <text start="638.65" dur="4.2">doesn&amp;#39;t have the right to shoot them</text>
  <text start="640.15" dur="5.46">down yes every country has the right to</text>
  <text start="642.85" dur="6.57">protect their sovereign airspace their</text>
  <text start="645.61" dur="7.65">country if another country is flying in</text>
  <text start="649.42" dur="7.05">and bombing that country it is an act of</text>
  <text start="653.26" dur="6">war and this is exactly what the deep</text>
  <text start="656.47" dur="5.85">state wants to do they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="659.26" dur="5.49">a war now Putin is out there and he</text>
  <text start="662.32" dur="4.68">spoke to Netanyahu and he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="664.75" dur="5.79">Netanyahu needs to calm the situation</text>
  <text start="667" dur="7.11">down and he needs to stop this violence</text>
  <text start="670.54" dur="5.97">before it gets out of control and we can</text>
  <text start="674.11" dur="4.65">see right now that Syria and Russia they</text>
  <text start="676.51" dur="4.2">have their s400 missile systems prepared</text>
  <text start="678.76" dur="5.94">and ready to go and if there are</text>

  <text start="688.42" dur="4.74">of the Islamic state most of the paid</text>
  <text start="691.12" dur="3.99">mercenaries they&amp;#39;re pretty much done for</text>
  <text start="693.16" dur="3.51">and the whole thing&amp;#39;s falling apart this</text>
  <text start="695.11" dur="3.72">is why Israel and part of the deep state</text>
  <text start="696.67" dur="4.29">system this is why they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="698.83" dur="2.76">start this war they&amp;#39;re pushing their</text>
  <text start="700.96" dur="2.49">agenda</text>
  <text start="701.59" dur="4.02">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="703.45" dur="4.62">that James mantises out there along with</text>
  <text start="705.61" dur="4.29">the French defense minister saying that</text>
  <text start="708.07" dur="4.62">they have no evidence that Assad used</text>
  <text start="709.9" dur="4.8">chemical weapons in Syria there is no</text>
  <text start="712.69" dur="4.32">evidence whatsoever now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="714.7" dur="5.31">seeing if we go back in time because</text>
  <text start="717.01" dur="4.92">back in May of 2017 mattis had a</text>
  <text start="720.01" dur="2.34">different story telling us that yes</text>
  <text start="721.93" dur="3.63">maybe a</text>
  <text start="722.35" dur="4.77">I did use chemical weapons as the Trump</text>
  <text start="725.56" dur="2.72">administration and those Patriots and</text>
  <text start="727.12" dur="3.69">government take more and more control</text>
  <text start="728.28" dur="4.33">we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot less of this we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="730.81" dur="4.02">gonna see messages coming out saying no</text>
  <text start="732.61" dur="3.57">this didn&amp;#39;t happen they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="734.83" dur="2.55">say yes there might have been this</text>
  <text start="736.18" dur="3.51">attack or that they&amp;#39;re just going to</text>
  <text start="737.38" dur="4.77">come out and flatly disagree with the</text>
  <text start="739.69" dur="4.14">corporate media completely because that</text>
  <text start="742.15" dur="3.81">means they&amp;#39;re gaining more and more</text>
  <text start="743.83" dur="3.87">power and we&amp;#39;re actually starting to see</text>
  <text start="745.96" dur="2.7">this because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="747.7" dur="3.09">is they&amp;#39;re saying yeah</text>
  <text start="748.66" dur="4.8">there are no there is no evidence of</text>
  <text start="750.79" dur="3.72">chemical weapons Assad can be the</text>
  <text start="753.46" dur="3.12">elected leader there</text>
  <text start="754.51" dur="3.69">yes Syria is a sovereign country and</text>
  <text start="756.58" dur="4.56">everything is gonna go completely</text>
  <text start="758.2" dur="5.46">against the corporate media as the Trump</text>
  <text start="761.14" dur="4.65">administration the Patriots within his</text>
  <text start="763.66" dur="4.38">administration and those non elected</text>
  <text start="765.79" dur="4.44">leaders who are working with him as they</text>
  <text start="768.04" dur="4.44">gain more and more power you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="770.23" dur="4.11">see them completely disagree with the</text>
  <text start="772.48" dur="4.2">corporate media they&amp;#39;re not going to say</text>
  <text start="774.34" dur="4.23">yes Assad must go all this is going to</text>
  <text start="776.68" dur="3.39">stop and we&amp;#39;re already starting to see</text>
  <text start="778.57" dur="3.9">this actually mattis was out there and</text>
  <text start="780.07" dur="6.03">he&amp;#39;s saying listen we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="782.47" dur="5.58">have a wider war with Syria we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="786.1" dur="4.53">bringing in troops we&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="788.05" dur="5.13">attacking because what happened during</text>
  <text start="790.63" dur="5.43">this little skirmish where the u.s.</text>
  <text start="793.18" dur="5.16">attacked the Syrian Armed Forces this</text>
  <text start="796.06" dur="4.41">was created by the deep state to push a</text>
  <text start="798.34" dur="4.5">war we see Israel right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="800.47" dur="5.79">preparing for a war in the north and</text>
  <text start="802.84" dur="5.37">they are moving their air defense system</text>
  <text start="806.26" dur="2.88">they&amp;#39;re moving alongside the Syrian</text>
  <text start="808.21" dur="3.99">border right now</text>
  <text start="809.14" dur="5.79">and I&amp;#39;m very worried that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="812.2" dur="5.04">to be trying to push another war it</text>
  <text start="814.93" dur="4.29">looks like they&amp;#39;re getting ready to try</text>
  <text start="817.24" dur="4.32">to do something and they&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="819.22" dur="5.31">their air defense systems all in this</text>
  <text start="821.56" dur="5.16">area to protect Israel from what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="824.53" dur="4.56">about to do because you know if you</text>
  <text start="826.72" dur="4.32">attack another country that country is</text>
  <text start="829.09" dur="4.08">going to return around and retaliate</text>
  <text start="831.04" dur="4.41">against the country that attacked them</text>
  <text start="833.17" dur="5.79">and but this is what they want and I</text>
  <text start="835.45" dur="5.94">think Putin and Syria they&amp;#39;re sitting</text>
  <text start="838.96" dur="4.62">back they&amp;#39;re not going to take the</text>
  <text start="841.39" dur="3.9">approach of attacking I don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="843.58" dur="2.64">they&amp;#39;re going to fire missiles into</text>
  <text start="845.29" dur="3.54">Israel</text>
  <text start="846.22" dur="4.47">I think Israel is going to try to set up</text>
  <text start="848.83" dur="3.12">a lot of different false flags along</text>
  <text start="850.69" dur="3.45">with the deep state and mostly the</text>
  <text start="851.95" dur="4.139">coalition forces that are along with</text>
  <text start="854.14" dur="4.109">this and they&amp;#39;re going to try to make</text>
  <text start="856.089" dur="4.651">look like something is about to happen</text>
  <text start="858.249" dur="4.861">and they&amp;#39;re hoping they&amp;#39;re hoping that</text>
  <text start="860.74" dur="4.62">they take the bait they&amp;#39;re hoping that</text>
  <text start="863.11" dur="4.26">they push the agenda but I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="865.36" dur="3.389">this is going to work and the reason why</text>
  <text start="867.37" dur="3.899">they&amp;#39;re doing this is this is one of</text>
  <text start="868.749" dur="4.77">their last acts of trying to get</text>
  <text start="871.269" dur="4.17">something started we see already cyber</text>
  <text start="873.519" dur="3.661">attacks have started in North Korea we</text>
  <text start="875.439" dur="5.671">see they&amp;#39;re pushing the agenda in Syria</text>
  <text start="877.18" dur="7.889">and if all this fails they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="881.11" dur="7.849">use a major a major event to really show</text>
  <text start="885.069" dur="7.921">that you know the North Koreans the</text>
  <text start="888.959" dur="6.55">Islamic state or the Iranians whoever</text>
  <text start="892.99" dur="4.649">they push the Russians they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="895.509" dur="4.861">try to make it look like they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="897.639" dur="5.461">ones who started this all off by</text>
  <text start="900.37" dur="4.92">creating an event of all events and</text>
  <text start="903.1" dur="3.929">again we&amp;#39;re seeing the cyber attacks</text>
  <text start="905.29" dur="3.539">where they&amp;#39;re pinning this either on</text>
  <text start="907.029" dur="4.201">Russia they&amp;#39;re putting in on North Korea</text>
  <text start="908.829" dur="4.891">and they can take this and move this as</text>
  <text start="911.23" dur="3.87">part of their agenda to say now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="913.72" dur="3.57">cyber attacking the financial</text>
  <text start="915.1" dur="4.169">institutions now they&amp;#39;re cyber attacking</text>
  <text start="917.29" dur="5.039">the infrastructure and they can push</text>
  <text start="919.269" dur="4.951">their agenda so we can see that the</text>
  <text start="922.329" dur="4.2">Trump administration is gaining strength</text>
  <text start="924.22" dur="3.989">they&amp;#39;re countering everything the</text>
  <text start="926.529" dur="4.74">corporate media is saying and this is</text>
  <text start="928.209" dur="5.13">gonna grow every single day and pretty</text>
  <text start="931.269" dur="4.141">soon there&amp;#39;ll be just everything&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="933.339" dur="3.901">to counter everything they say and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="935.41" dur="3.899">gonna see the deep state pushing their</text>
  <text start="937.24" dur="3.839">agenda to try to get us into war we&amp;#39;re</text>
