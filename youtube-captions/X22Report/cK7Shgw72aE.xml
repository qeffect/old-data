  <text start="229.239" dur="6.571">like Huawei 5g Telecom the Chinese firms</text>
  <text start="232.989" dur="4.831">on the US block entity list which is the</text>
  <text start="235.81" dur="4.89">blacklist they&amp;#39;re not part of the</text>
  <text start="237.82" dur="5.76">discussion those issues fall under the</text>
  <text start="240.7" dur="5.37">u.s. national security and will not be</text>
  <text start="243.58" dur="6.629">part of any of the ongoing trade</text>
  <text start="246.07" dur="7.59">negotiations overall when you look at</text>
  <text start="250.209" dur="6.81">this this was all done according to plan</text>
  <text start="253.66" dur="6.299">and China as we know they have the</text>
  <text start="257.019" dur="5.461">protests happening in China they also</text>
  <text start="259.959" dur="6.571">need to buy food because they have a</text>
  <text start="262.48" dur="5.85">problem with pork and there are a</text>
  <text start="266.53" dur="4.02">limited number of export markets that</text>
  <text start="268.33" dur="5.61">can generate the scale of agricultural</text>
  <text start="270.55" dur="6.14">imports that China demands so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="273.94" dur="5.76">dependent on the United States and</text>
  <text start="276.69" dur="5.89">hungry Chinese people only make the</text>
  <text start="279.7" dur="6.36">issues in and around Hong Kong much much</text>
  <text start="282.58" dur="5.94">worse so Trump wants to sell them food</text>
  <text start="286.06" dur="5.85">to help us farmers so he made the deal</text>
  <text start="288.52" dur="7.43">and guess what the scale of Chinese</text>
  <text start="291.91" dur="9.63">purchases is too significant to overlook</text>
  <text start="295.95" dur="9.73">Trump the deal that he made suspends a</text>
  <text start="301.54" dur="7.85">5% tariff to gain 50 billion in farm</text>
  <text start="305.68" dur="6.56">purchases think about this first SEC</text>
  <text start="309.39" dur="7">what do you think is happening here</text>
  <text start="312.24" dur="6.64">Trump is continually hitting the Chinese</text>
  <text start="316.39" dur="5.4">over and over and over and every time</text>
  <text start="318.88" dur="5.22">they don&amp;#39;t agree or don&amp;#39;t do what the</text>
  <text start="321.79" dur="2.7">Trump administration wants they hit him</text>
  <text start="324.1" dur="2.16">again</text>
  <text start="324.49" dur="4.14">now they thought they were gonna be able</text>
  <text start="326.26" dur="5.94">to ride this out they thought they had</text>
  <text start="328.63" dur="7.11">the upper hand but as you can see they</text>
  <text start="332.2" dur="5.88">don&amp;#39;t and what this means is the entire</text>
  <text start="335.74" dur="5.67">world who was against this who&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="338.08" dur="7.83">in part against this all of a sudden as</text>
  <text start="341.41" dur="7.56">we move forward many countries are going</text>
  <text start="345.91" dur="8.57">to get involved China has made across</text>
  <text start="348.97" dur="9.93">the world many unfair trade deals why</text>
  <text start="354.48" dur="8.32">why is this so lopsided because we need</text>
  <text start="358.9" dur="5.94">to remember the central bankers who are</text>
  <text start="362.8" dur="4.86">controlling the world the entire</text>
  <text start="364.84" dur="6.21">currency system right now they were</text>
  <text start="367.66" dur="5.7">planning to move their system that is</text>
  <text start="371.05" dur="5.16">imploding which will collapse to</text>
  <text start="373.36" dur="6.89">someplace else they were going to have</text>
  <text start="376.21" dur="8.25">an event and I needed all this in place</text>
  <text start="380.25" dur="7.39">because they knew eventually China would</text>
  <text start="384.46" dur="5.97">be the hub now remember the central bank</text>
  <text start="387.64" dur="5.16">they do not have an allegiance to a</text>
  <text start="390.43" dur="6.21">country or group they move their</text>
  <text start="392.8" dur="6.03">operation around and they place it where</text>
  <text start="396.64" dur="5.6">they believe it&amp;#39;s going to serve them</text>
  <text start="398.83" dur="7.44">the best that&amp;#39;s it but as you can see</text>
  <text start="402.24" dur="9.37">once these deals are made countries are</text>
  <text start="406.27" dur="9.54">going to join in and soon we will see</text>
  <text start="411.61" dur="10.13">this now something very interesting the</text>
  <text start="415.81" dur="9.51">Dutch central bank has shocked many</text>
  <text start="421.74" dur="6.73">because they made a claim they said if</text>
  <text start="425.32" dur="7.11">the entire system collapses</text>
  <text start="428.47" dur="6.33">the goldstock provides a collateral to</text>
  <text start="432.43" dur="5.7">start over now this is a tweet from</text>
  <text start="434.8" dur="6">willem and this is how it reads and this</text>
  <text start="438.13" dur="4.98">is the translation shares bonds and</text>
  <text start="440.8" dur="4.02">other security everything is risk if the</text>
  <text start="443.11" dur="4.23">whole system collapses the gold Socko</text>
  <text start="444.82" dur="4.53">offers a collateral to start over goal</text>
  <text start="447.34" dur="4.59">gives confidence in the power of the</text>
  <text start="449.35" dur="4.89">central bank&amp;#39;s balance sheet now think</text>
  <text start="451.93" dur="6.06">about this for a second the central</text>
  <text start="454.24" dur="6.18">bank&amp;#39;s have been buying gold for quite a</text>
  <text start="457.99" dur="5.73">while now they understand that their</text>
  <text start="460.42" dur="5.31">fiat system their fiat currency is going</text>
  <text start="463.72" dur="5.25">to go to zero it will be worth</text>
  <text start="465.73" dur="4.65">absolutely nothing they also understand</text>
  <text start="468.97" dur="3.84">that gold is real money remember</text>
  <text start="470.38" dur="4.95">whenever they tell you gold is a</text>
  <text start="472.81" dur="5.39">barbarous relic gold is unimportant</text>
  <text start="475.33" dur="8.1">unimportant it&amp;#39;s not real money always</text>
  <text start="478.2" dur="8.38">think the opposite and what the central</text>
  <text start="483.43" dur="5.43">bank is saying right now is if this is</text>
  <text start="486.58" dur="4.56">more when the system and if you notice</text>
  <text start="488.86" dur="5.309">they know their system is doomed</text>
  <text start="491.14" dur="5.55">they don&amp;#39;t have an event they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="494.169" dur="5.25">a war they don&amp;#39;t have anything to cover</text>
  <text start="496.69" dur="4.86">this up Trump right now just completed</text>
  <text start="499.419" dur="5.581">phase one of the trade deal this whole</text>
  <text start="501.55" dur="5.25">entire story of the tariffs are the</text>
  <text start="505" dur="3.93">problem the trade wars are the problem</text>
  <text start="506.8" dur="6.33">with in with this entire global system</text>
  <text start="508.93" dur="6.69">that is going to fall apart and like we</text>
  <text start="513.13" dur="4.86">said many many months ago Trump right</text>
  <text start="515.62" dur="3.84">now is making the deal remember he told</text>
  <text start="517.99" dur="3.9">trying to listen either make the deal</text>
  <text start="519.46" dur="6.15">now which I do believe Trump does want</text>
  <text start="521.89" dur="5.34">the deal most likely in mid 2020 I think</text>
  <text start="525.61" dur="3.41">he would like to wrap it up because this</text>
  <text start="527.23" dur="5.28">would then lead into the elections and</text>
  <text start="529.02" dur="5.56">it would expose the central bank and</text>
  <text start="532.51" dur="4.02">everything else and actually moving into</text>
  <text start="534.58" dur="4.29">the elections it would show that the</text>
  <text start="536.53" dur="6.21">economy was strong there are no more</text>
  <text start="538.87" dur="7.16">trade wars and he would control pretty</text>
  <text start="542.74" dur="6.33">much the entire economic narrative and</text>
  <text start="546.03" dur="5.41">what would happen at that point well the</text>
  <text start="549.07" dur="4.26">mainstream media the central bank and</text>
  <text start="551.44" dur="3.12">everything else that&amp;#39;s been reporting</text>
  <text start="553.33" dur="3.99">this is the problem with the economy</text>
  <text start="554.56" dur="6.42">well the United States will look strong</text>
  <text start="557.32" dur="4.74">the rest of the world will still look</text>
  <text start="560.98" dur="3.6">weak</text>
  <text start="562.06" dur="4.17">now why would they still look weak</text>
  <text start="564.58" dur="3.33">because it had nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="566.23" dur="4.02">trade bourse had nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="567.91" dur="5.04">tariffs it had to do with the central</text>
  <text start="570.25" dur="5.22">bank system why is the United States</text>
  <text start="572.95" dur="4.44">going to look strong because we are the</text>
  <text start="575.47" dur="4.29">reserve currency of the world what is</text>
  <text start="577.39" dur="4.77">Trump doing he&amp;#39;s setting it up he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="579.76" dur="3.96">lowering the rates to be competitive</text>
  <text start="582.16" dur="4.2">around the world with all the other</text>
  <text start="583.72" dur="6.12">central banks he&amp;#39;s starting stimulus and</text>
  <text start="586.36" dur="6.21">he&amp;#39;s introducing this drug on purpose</text>
  <text start="589.84" dur="5.34">because he&amp;#39;s going to show the entire</text>
  <text start="592.57" dur="4.83">world it had nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="595.18" dur="6.24">trade wars it had nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="597.4" dur="7.74">tariffs it is the central bank system</text>
  <text start="601.42" dur="6.81">that is the problem and the only reason</text>
  <text start="605.14" dur="5.46">the United States is doing well is</text>
  <text start="608.23" dur="4.2">because he brought the interest rates to</text>
  <text start="610.6" dur="3.75">zero and started tzimmes now of course</text>
  <text start="612.43" dur="3.57">he&amp;#39;s not going to say that but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="614.35" dur="4.32">gonna start to point the finger at</text>
  <text start="616" dur="4.02">Europe at other countries around the</text>
  <text start="618.67" dur="4.47">world to say look what the central banks</text>
  <text start="620.02" dur="4.47">have done to them and eventually when it</text>
  <text start="623.14" dur="3.96">comes back here to the United States</text>
  <text start="624.49" dur="4.32">he&amp;#39;s gonna point the finger at the</text>
  <text start="627.1" dur="5.04">central bank here in the United States</text>
  <text start="628.81" dur="6.72">now Trump tweeted out something which I</text>
  <text start="632.14" dur="5.73">find very very important because we need</text>
  <text start="635.53" dur="6.09">to remember the central bank they are</text>
  <text start="637.87" dur="7.08">the source I would say of 99 percent of</text>
  <text start="641.62" dur="7.01">the problems here around the world that</text>
  <text start="644.95" dur="7.26">have to do with hunger poverty Wars</text>
  <text start="648.63" dur="7.81">corruption and everything else this is</text>
  <text start="652.21" dur="7.35">the source and Trump tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="656.44" dur="5.64">following we have become a far greater</text>
  <text start="659.56" dur="7.1">economic power than ever before and</text>
  <text start="662.08" dur="7.88">we&amp;#39;re using that power for world peace</text>
  <text start="666.66" dur="7.36">now think about what he&amp;#39;s saying here</text>
  <text start="669.96" dur="8.14">he&amp;#39;s saying the actual opposite of what</text>
  <text start="674.02" dur="8.81">the central bank does and has been doing</text>
  <text start="678.1" dur="10.31">with their economic power now remember</text>
  <text start="682.83" dur="9.49">the central bank they control the Fed</text>
  <text start="688.41" dur="5.89">the ECB the private western central bank</text>
  <text start="692.32" dur="6.65">and all the other countries</text>
  <text start="694.3" dur="10.67">the IMF the biz and then the Rothschilds</text>
  <text start="698.97" dur="10.3">their main focus is control war using</text>
  <text start="704.97" dur="7.09">economic power Trump is saying we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="709.27" dur="7.71">going to be using economic power for</text>
  <text start="712.06" dur="8.13">world peace very important and remember</text>
  <text start="716.98" dur="6.51">what Q said and remember what the Dutch</text>
  <text start="720.19" dur="5.76">central bank said Gold is going to be</text>
  <text start="723.49" dur="5.76">very important when everything is said</text>
  <text start="725.95" dur="7.11">and done and a fiat currency completely</text>
