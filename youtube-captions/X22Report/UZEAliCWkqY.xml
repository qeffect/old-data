  <text start="117.74" dur="4.169">this continually</text>
  <text start="119.03" dur="4.23">ongoing until a certain point where all</text>
  <text start="121.909" dur="3.361">of a sudden they start saying well</text>
  <text start="123.26" dur="3.899">because of what Trump is doing or</text>
  <text start="125.27" dur="3.39">because of this or that this is why the</text>
  <text start="127.159" dur="4.05">economy is failing and then eventually</text>
  <text start="128.66" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;ll have an event to really bring it</text>
  <text start="131.209" dur="5.871">home but what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that most</text>
  <text start="134" dur="6.54">of what they&amp;#39;ve been telling us I&amp;#39;d say</text>
  <text start="137.08" dur="6.4">99.999% has been a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="140.54" dur="4.68">lie where they&amp;#39;ve tricked us into</text>
  <text start="143.48" dur="3.63">thinking that the economy&amp;#39;s doing well</text>
  <text start="145.22" dur="4.56">and they continually do this they</text>
  <text start="147.11" dur="4.68">continually lie to the people to</text>
  <text start="149.78" dur="4.41">convince us that things are fine now out</text>
  <text start="151.79" dur="4.68">in Canada we&amp;#39;re starting to see that</text>
  <text start="154.19" dur="5.4">home values well they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="156.47" dur="5.7">decline and this is the first time since</text>
  <text start="159.59" dur="5.07">the first quarter of 2009 now remember</text>
  <text start="162.17" dur="5.46">all of this was pumped up to make us</text>
  <text start="164.66" dur="5.91">believe that everything is fantastic and</text>
  <text start="167.63" dur="5.4">all I did was create incredible gigantic</text>
  <text start="170.57" dur="5.19">bubbles and every time I do this they</text>
  <text start="173.03" dur="4.56">pop we see household debt in Canada rose</text>
  <text start="175.76" dur="3.75">to a new record of about two point one</text>
  <text start="177.59" dur="4.709">one trillion in the third quarter of</text>
  <text start="179.51" dur="5.819">2017 this is up by five point two</text>
  <text start="182.299" dur="4.651">percent from a year ago and up ten point</text>
  <text start="185.329" dur="4.111">seven percent from two years ago</text>
  <text start="186.95" dur="5.009">this is coming from Statistics Canada</text>
  <text start="189.44" dur="5.4">and most of the data is coming from</text>
  <text start="191.959" dur="5.521">mortgages which is which is about sixty</text>
  <text start="194.84" dur="4.5">five point six percent of the total debt</text>
  <text start="197.48" dur="3.69">right now and the rest is coming from</text>
  <text start="199.34" dur="3.92">credit cards or loans and things like</text>
  <text start="201.17" dur="4.62">that and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="203.26" dur="4.18">Canada&amp;#39;s infamous household debt to</text>
  <text start="205.79" dur="3.449">disposable income ratio one of the</text>
  <text start="207.44" dur="4.98">highest in the world rose to a</text>
  <text start="209.239" dur="5.701">breath-taking record of a hundred and</text>
  <text start="212.42" dur="4.349">seventy three point three percent now</text>
  <text start="214.94" dur="3.689">the ratio means that households on</text>
  <text start="216.769" dur="4.461">average a one hundred and seventy-three</text>
  <text start="218.629" dur="5.731">dollars for every dollar after-tax</text>
  <text start="221.23" dur="5.349">income earned and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="224.36" dur="4.379">this is not just happening in Canada</text>
  <text start="226.579" dur="4.651">it&amp;#39;s happening in the United States it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="228.739" dur="4.791">happening out in Australia in Europe and</text>
  <text start="231.23" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s varying from country to country</text>
  <text start="233.53" dur="4.9">here in the United States we see initial</text>
  <text start="236.09" dur="5.729">jobless claims they are back to forty</text>
  <text start="238.43" dur="5.13">four year lows and every time we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="241.819" dur="5.76">this and this is the lowest it&amp;#39;s ever</text>
  <text start="243.56" dur="8.31">been we enter a recession a depression</text>
  <text start="247.579" dur="6.421">and if we look back going back to 1970s</text>
  <text start="251.87" dur="5.339">because that&amp;#39;s the level we&amp;#39;re at we</text>
  <text start="254" dur="5.7">were in a huge recession at that time</text>
  <text start="257.209" dur="5.191">when we go back to the 80s when we go</text>
  <text start="259.7" dur="6.3">back to the 90s when we go back to 2000</text>
  <text start="262.4" dur="7.079">2001 go back to 2008 it has always been</text>
  <text start="266" dur="6.18">the same exact pattern and as we move</text>
  <text start="269.479" dur="6.121">forward it&amp;#39;s not going to get any better</text>
  <text start="272.18" dur="5.76">what this is telling us is that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="275.6" dur="4.92">been manipulating these numbers bringing</text>
  <text start="277.94" dur="5.699">this down trying to convince us that no</text>
  <text start="280.52" dur="5.01">one is you know applying for initial</text>
  <text start="283.639" dur="3.481">jobless claims there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong</text>
  <text start="285.53" dur="3.72">with the economy the unemployment is at</text>
  <text start="287.12" dur="5.519">the lowest point ever and if this is</text>
  <text start="289.25" dur="4.95">true we would see retail sales booming</text>
  <text start="292.639" dur="3.931">like we&amp;#39;ve never seen before</text>
  <text start="294.2" dur="3.92">and it just so happens out of the</text>
  <text start="296.57" dur="2.88">corporate media and we see it all over</text>
  <text start="298.12" dur="3.6">Bloomberg</text>
  <text start="299.45" dur="5.49">we see it all over the corporate media</text>
  <text start="301.72" dur="6.129">you see articles everywhere</text>
  <text start="304.94" dur="7.08">saying that US retail sales surged at</text>
  <text start="307.849" dur="6.841">the fastest pace since 2012 and online</text>
  <text start="312.02" dur="4.62">sales they are soaring now remember</text>
  <text start="314.69" dur="4.32">these are government numbers remember</text>
  <text start="316.64" dur="3.96">these are estimates remember how they</text>
  <text start="319.01" dur="3.9">figure this out</text>
  <text start="320.6" dur="4.08">they take what they have and if they</text>
  <text start="322.91" dur="4.08">don&amp;#39;t like what they have they change it</text>
  <text start="324.68" dur="4.56">they don&amp;#39;t count the stores that are</text>
  <text start="326.99" dur="4.71">closing they don&amp;#39;t count any of that</text>
  <text start="329.24" dur="4.64">they take it and they factor it out over</text>
  <text start="331.7" dur="4.56">the year to make it look really good and</text>
  <text start="333.88" dur="5.14">we need to remember something very</text>
  <text start="336.26" dur="7.05">important about this is that a third of</text>
  <text start="339.02" dur="7.95">the sales are coming from gasoline sales</text>
  <text start="343.31" dur="5.1">because they increased in price that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="346.97" dur="3.39">where they&amp;#39;re getting these numbers from</text>
  <text start="348.41" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;s not all I mean we have</text>
  <text start="350.36" dur="4.17">manipulating numbers now people are</text>
  <text start="352.13" dur="4.47">gonna say well just a minute we can see</text>

  <text start="359.93" dur="4.08">and let&amp;#39;s look at some of the headlines</text>
  <text start="361.67" dur="4.35">that they were reporting at the same</text>
  <text start="364.01" dur="6.57">time and let me know if it sounds really</text>
  <text start="366.02" dur="8.61">familiar Holly Holliday retail sales</text>

  <text start="404" dur="5.4">my business insider so wait a minute</text>
  <text start="407.69" dur="5.79">they had these headlines telling us how</text>
  <text start="409.4" dur="6.87">great retail sales were back in 2016</text>
  <text start="413.48" dur="5.34">going into 2017 and we reported back</text>
  <text start="416.27" dur="4.05">then that this was a lie these aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="418.82" dur="4.5">even the real retail numbers they</text>
  <text start="420.32" dur="6.18">haven&amp;#39;t even come out yet so think about</text>
  <text start="423.32" dur="4.98">this for a second when we enter genja</text>
  <text start="426.5" dur="3">and actually during the holiday season</text>
  <text start="428.3" dur="2.49">we talked about the stores that were</text>
  <text start="429.5" dur="4.08">closing down who declare bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="430.79" dur="5.1">during the holiday season while these</text>
  <text start="433.58" dur="3.63">headlines were coming out and then right</text>
  <text start="435.89" dur="3">after the holiday season</text>
  <text start="437.21" dur="4.29">Macy&amp;#39;s said they had to close some</text>
  <text start="438.89" dur="4.86">stores then all of a sudden the retail</text>
  <text start="441.5" dur="4.2">apocalypse started to pick up all of a</text>
  <text start="443.75" dur="4.979">sudden we heard a lot more stores going</text>
  <text start="445.7" dur="6.6">bankrupt remember their debt comes due</text>
  <text start="448.729" dur="5.401">next year do you really think what the</text>
  <text start="452.3" dur="2.19">corporate media is putting out there</text>
  <text start="454.13" dur="3.539">right</text>
  <text start="454.49" dur="5.85">now is the truth do you really think</text>
  <text start="457.669" dur="6.391">retail sales are that best they&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="460.34" dur="6.99">seen I mean think about what is</text>
  <text start="464.06" dur="5.669">happening here first of all these are</text>
  <text start="467.33" dur="4.649">government numbers we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="469.729" dur="3.72">completely manipulated these aren&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="471.979" dur="2.671">real numbers from the retails I remember</text>
  <text start="473.449" dur="2.641">when the government receives the real</text>
  <text start="474.65" dur="2.94">numbers from the retails if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="476.09" dur="6.02">like what they&amp;#39;re seeing they change</text>
  <text start="477.59" dur="7.199">them we&amp;#39;ve seen the same exact headlines</text>
  <text start="482.11" dur="4.69">there is no difference between this year</text>
  <text start="484.789" dur="2.88">at wit there is a difference this year</text>
  <text start="486.8" dur="2.07">it&amp;#39;s a lot worse</text>
  <text start="487.669" dur="2.881">we&amp;#39;ve already had all these stores</text>
  <text start="488.87" dur="5.31">closed we&amp;#39;ve had a lot of people laid</text>
  <text start="490.55" dur="7.679">off debt has risen to astronomical</text>
  <text start="494.18" dur="5.28">levels people can&amp;#39;t go out and spend why</text>
  <text start="498.229" dur="4.41">think about it</text>
  <text start="499.46" dur="4.949">wages are declining so wages are</text>
  <text start="502.639" dur="5.821">declining but people are spending more</text>
  <text start="504.409" dur="6.091">money wait a minute the debt level for</text>
  <text start="508.46" dur="4.11">consumers has reached a point where</text>
  <text start="510.5" dur="3.06">we&amp;#39;ve never seen this before well yes</text>
  <text start="512.57" dur="3.36">the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="513.56" dur="5.519">so people have brought their credit</text>
  <text start="515.93" dur="5.159">cards up to the max but people are still</text>
  <text start="519.079" dur="3.75">spending weight savings have been coming</text>
  <text start="521.089" dur="4.711">down so where are they getting all this</text>
  <text start="522.829" dur="6.331">money to spend think about this for a</text>
  <text start="525.8" dur="6.599">second common sense tells you they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="529.16" dur="6.81">lying and we prove this time and time</text>
  <text start="532.399" dur="5.75">again each and every year because after</text>
  <text start="535.97" dur="5.07">the holiday season guess what happens</text>
  <text start="538.149" dur="4.661">stores closed they tell you how bad it</text>
  <text start="541.04" dur="4.799">is they show all the different</text>
  <text start="542.81" dur="4.32">bankruptcies and all of a sudden and if</text>
  <text start="545.839" dur="4.081">you go back in time you can check the</text>
  <text start="547.13" dur="5.49">wayback machine the corporate media</text>
  <text start="549.92" dur="5.07">starts changing their headlines they do</text>
  <text start="552.62" dur="4.44">this quite often where they tell you the</text>
  <text start="554.99" dur="3.659">holiday season is great and then after</text>
  <text start="557.06" dur="5.04">the holiday season they go back and they</text>
  <text start="558.649" dur="6.051">change the headline to fit a completely</text>
  <text start="562.1" dur="5.76">different narrative of the story and</text>
  <text start="564.7" dur="6.07">we&amp;#39;re gonna see this once again the</text>
  <text start="567.86" dur="6.539">whole thing is a lie we see that the</text>
  <text start="570.77" dur="7.95">service industry has slumped and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="574.399" dur="6.871">declining it&amp;#39;s at 15 month lows Janet</text>
  <text start="578.72" dur="5.91">Yellen was asked a question by Steve</text>
  <text start="581.27" dur="6.36">Liesman and the question was every day</text>
  <text start="584.63" dur="3.699">and he&amp;#39;s from CNBC every day it seems</text>
  <text start="587.63" dur="2.619">the stock</text>
  <text start="588.329" dur="5.22">market goes up triple digits on the Dow</text>
  <text start="590.249" dur="5.041">Jones is it now or will it soon become a</text>

  <text start="595.29" dur="4.229">valuations are this high</text>
  <text start="597.209" dur="4.771">now this answer that genuine Janet</text>
  <text start="599.519" dur="3.961">Yellen gave was incredible I think when</text>
  <text start="601.98" dur="2.669">we look at other indicators of financial</text>
  <text start="603.48" dur="4.229">stability risks</text>
  <text start="604.649" dur="6.03">there&amp;#39;s nothing flashing red there or</text>
  <text start="607.709" dur="5.25">possibly even orange we have a much more</text>
  <text start="610.679" dur="3.291">resilient stronger banking system than</text>
  <text start="612.959" dur="5.12">ever before</text>
  <text start="613.97" dur="8.109">well actually Janet Yellen we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="618.079" dur="5.891">because just one week ago and the annual</text>
  <text start="622.079" dur="5.55">report from the Office of Financial</text>
  <text start="623.97" dur="5.609">Stability issued a very clear and very</text>
  <text start="627.629" dur="3.69">explicit warning about the</text>
  <text start="629.579" dur="5.01">vulnerabilities and a financial system</text>
  <text start="631.319" dur="5.88">in which they warned that the increase</text>
  <text start="634.589" dur="5.22">in already elevated asset prices and the</text>
  <text start="637.199" dur="5.94">decrease in risk premiums may leave some</text>
  <text start="639.809" dur="7.101">markets vulnerable to a large correction</text>
  <text start="643.139" dur="6.63">a polite government term saying crash</text>

  <text start="885.089" dur="4.531">on someone else on an event or anything</text>
  <text start="887.55" dur="4.83">else so they&amp;#39;re gonna do this until the</text>
  <text start="889.62" dur="4.409">very very end they might trickle in some</text>
  <text start="892.38" dur="3.449">of the things that say oh if Trump does</text>
  <text start="894.029" dur="3.24">this this is gonna hurt the economy just</text>
  <text start="895.829" dur="4.291">to make it look really really good that</text>
  <text start="897.269" dur="5.101">Trump is gonna be responsible or you</text>
  <text start="900.12" dur="4.019">know this is why this is happening</text>
  <text start="902.37" dur="3.719">because of this event or whatever</text>
  <text start="904.139" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re gonna dream up because you know</text>
  <text start="906.089" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re gonna dream up something and at</text>
  <text start="908.069" dur="3.69">this point right now this is what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="910.199" dur="3.301">been looking at all along it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="911.759" dur="3.481">like going back to 2008 looking at the</text>
  <text start="913.5" dur="3.87">subprime securities where they told it</text>
  <text start="915.24" dur="3.329">was old triple-a retail was doing grade</text>
  <text start="917.37" dur="3.569">the stock market can never go down</text>
  <text start="918.569" dur="3.991">housing can never go down everything is</text>
  <text start="920.939" dur="4.65">contained and everything just completely</text>
  <text start="922.56" dur="6.329">fell apart here we are looking through</text>
  <text start="925.589" dur="5.161">the propaganda and looking at the nuts</text>
  <text start="928.889" dur="3.3">and bolts of the economy just like those</text>
  <text start="930.75" dur="3.569">individuals that looked at the subprime</text>
  <text start="932.189" dur="3.27">securities and said well I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="934.319" dur="2.041">believe what the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="935.459" dur="3.12">saying I don&amp;#39;t believe what Goldman</text>
  <text start="936.36" dur="4.169">Sachs is saying I want to see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="938.579" dur="3.541">inside these subprime securities and</text>
  <text start="940.529" dur="2.881">wait a minute their loans in there and</text>
  <text start="942.12" dur="2.699">most of them are defaulting and most of</text>
  <text start="943.41" dur="3.21">them are bad loans</text>
  <text start="944.819" dur="3.991">these aren&amp;#39;t rated triple-a there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="946.62" dur="4.319">something wrong here this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="948.81" dur="4.86">doing we&amp;#39;re looking through all this</text>
  <text start="950.939" dur="5.34">propaganda junk to see what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="953.67" dur="5.43">going on and saying you know something</text>
  <text start="956.279" dur="4.56">this doesn&amp;#39;t hold water what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="959.1" dur="3.87">saying here and we&amp;#39;ve been doing this</text>
  <text start="960.839" dur="4.261">for quite a while and we can see from</text>
  <text start="962.97" dur="4.739">what has been happening here it has been</text>
  <text start="965.1" dur="5.159">a slow deterioration of the economy</text>
  <text start="967.709" dur="4.171">because when we use common sense and we</text>
  <text start="970.259" dur="3.81">say well unemployment at four point one</text>
  <text start="971.88" dur="5.79">percent we should see retail booming and</text>
  <text start="974.069" dur="5.431">we made the connection we connected the</text>
  <text start="977.67" dur="3.599">dots and said well if this is going to</text>
  <text start="979.5" dur="4.23">happen then retail is going to decline</text>
  <text start="981.269" dur="3.75">and of course decline now people have</text>
  <text start="983.73" dur="3.57">said well that&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="985.019" dur="4.411">online and then we proved that online</text>
  <text start="987.3" dur="4.56">sales was only ten percent</text>
  <text start="989.43" dur="6.17">of retail market actually Amazon is only</text>
  <text start="991.86" dur="5.58">3% so what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is that</text>
  <text start="995.6" dur="3.37">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="997.44" dur="3.54">and connecting these dots and looking at</text>
  <text start="998.97" dur="3.929">all the indicators is showing us that</text>
  <text start="1000.98" dur="3.51">what they are feeding us is completely</text>
  <text start="1002.899" dur="4.051">fake phony and false and what is</text>
  <text start="1004.49" dur="4.32">happening is they&amp;#39;re keeping us in this</text>
