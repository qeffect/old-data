  <text start="28.2" dur="4.149">counting down to the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="30.49" dur="3.12">today we&amp;#39;re going to talk about the</text>
  <text start="32.349" dur="3.631">current news and then we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="33.61" dur="5.61">talk about Cyprus are these banks ever</text>
  <text start="35.98" dur="6.03">going to open up again what will happen</text>
  <text start="39.22" dur="4.229">when they do what does that mean for the</text>
  <text start="42.01" dur="3.259">rest of the world what does that mean</text>
  <text start="43.449" dur="5.941">for the United States what can we expect</text>
  <text start="45.269" dur="6.701">when these banks reopen if they do or</text>
  <text start="49.39" dur="6.36">what what happens if Cyprus goes</text>
  <text start="51.97" dur="5.97">bankrupt what happens if Cyprus gets</text>
  <text start="55.75" dur="5.43">bailed out how is this going to affect</text>
  <text start="57.94" dur="6.27">us and is this something that we should</text>
  <text start="61.18" dur="5.7">be concerned about but let&amp;#39;s go through</text>
  <text start="64.21" dur="5.659">the current news and I was looking at</text>
  <text start="66.88" dur="5.46">some things here and I see that</text>
  <text start="69.869" dur="5.051">yesterday I said Diane Feinstein&amp;#39;s bill</text>
  <text start="72.34" dur="4.86">was shot down but she&amp;#39;s not giving up</text>
  <text start="74.92" dur="6.51">she&amp;#39;s still going to go forward with it</text>
  <text start="77.2" dur="8.669">and it looks like the American Bar</text>
  <text start="81.43" dur="7.1">Association for Human Rights issued a</text>
  <text start="85.869" dur="9">white paper on the UN arms trade treaty</text>
  <text start="88.53" dur="8.86">and they concluded that the proposed ATT</text>
  <text start="94.869" dur="6.151">is consistent with the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="97.39" dur="8.549">and I&amp;#39;m sitting here going what are you</text>
  <text start="101.02" dur="9.54">kidding me it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s that there is no</text>
  <text start="105.939" dur="7.591">other law besides the Constitution there</text>
  <text start="110.56" dur="6.66">are there are no UN laws that can</text>
  <text start="113.53" dur="6.12">override the Constitution yes they could</text>
  <text start="117.22" dur="5.37">say they&amp;#39;re going to but when this</text>
  <text start="119.65" dur="6.81">country was found this was what we live</text>
  <text start="122.59" dur="9.45">by and I if you looking at this they</text>
  <text start="126.46" dur="8.1">want to use this UN arms trade treaty to</text>
  <text start="132.04" dur="5.789">come after the guns if they can get them</text>
  <text start="134.56" dur="6.86">any other way and we have to watch this</text>
  <text start="137.829" dur="6.271">and be very careful and we should be</text>
  <text start="141.42" dur="7.409">alarmed we should be sitting here going</text>
  <text start="144.1" dur="9.029">you know what the hell&amp;#39;s going on and if</text>
  <text start="148.829" dur="6.621">President Obama does sign this and we</text>
  <text start="153.129" dur="5.981">have to abide by this</text>
  <text start="155.45" dur="5.7">we should be up in arms and hopefully</text>
  <text start="159.11" dur="4.86">the sheriff&amp;#39;s and the rest of the people</text>
  <text start="161.15" dur="5.309">will come out and say you know this is</text>
  <text start="163.97" dur="7.519">against the Second Amendment we do not</text>
  <text start="166.459" dur="7.081">follow this arms treaty and that&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="171.489" dur="9.36">but this is something that we need to</text>
  <text start="173.54" dur="7.309">keep an eye on now I noticed today that</text>
  <text start="181.54" dur="6.759">the CIA that had drones and the military</text>
  <text start="184.7" dur="6.42">department of justice has drones and now</text>
  <text start="188.299" dur="4.261">the cia&amp;#39;s handing over their drones not</text>
  <text start="191.12" dur="3.72">really handing it over but they would</text>
  <text start="192.56" dur="5.94">want to combine them and the Department</text>
  <text start="194.84" dur="7.44">of Justice military will take care of</text>
  <text start="198.5" dur="7.019">the drones and I started to think you</text>
  <text start="202.28" dur="7.11">know hmm that&amp;#39;s interesting why does the</text>
  <text start="205.519" dur="6.05">military want drones and why do they</text>
  <text start="209.39" dur="5.069">want to be in control of all of it and</text>
  <text start="211.569" dur="7.5">it brings me back to the letter that</text>
  <text start="214.459" dur="8.521">Rand Paul wrote to Eric Holder and when</text>
  <text start="219.069" dur="5.2">Rand Paul asked you know does the</text>
  <text start="222.98" dur="3.509">president have the authority to use</text>
  <text start="224.269" dur="4.891">weaponized drones to kill an American</text>
  <text start="226.489" dur="6.47">not engaged in combat on US soil of</text>
  <text start="229.16" dur="7.35">course holder wrote you know no but I</text>
  <text start="232.959" dur="5.68">started thinking to myself just that</text>
  <text start="236.51" dur="4.979">little tiny phrase to kill an American</text>
  <text start="238.639" dur="6.301">not engaged in combat and then what does</text>
  <text start="241.489" dur="7.201">combat it&amp;#39;s a fight or contest between</text>
  <text start="244.94" dur="7.549">individuals it&amp;#39;s a conflict or</text>
  <text start="248.69" dur="7.019">controversy so if there was some type of</text>
  <text start="252.489" dur="8.191">militia or revolution or people who</text>
  <text start="255.709" dur="9.361">wanted a protest this right here</text>
  <text start="260.68" dur="7.78">considers them to be in combat and from</text>
  <text start="265.07" dur="6.98">his answer they can use weaponized</text>
  <text start="268.46" dur="7.079">drones to kill Americans and this</text>
  <text start="272.05" dur="5.35">concerns me and I know I mentioned this</text>
  <text start="275.539" dur="6.181">in my other episodes but it&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="277.4" dur="8">back and this is if you notice every day</text>
  <text start="281.72" dur="6.72">there&amp;#39;s one little thing again these</text>
  <text start="285.4" dur="4.03">little news blurbs they don&amp;#39;t seem like</text>
  <text start="288.44" dur="2.79">much but</text>
  <text start="289.43" dur="3.6">you start putting them all together it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="291.23" dur="4.29">like a puzzle you got a lot of puzzle</text>
  <text start="293.03" dur="3.99">pieces and you start putting it now you</text>
  <text start="295.52" dur="5.28">can see the outline of what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="297.02" dur="5.79">trying what the puzzle is trying to tell</text>
  <text start="300.8" dur="4.02">you you add a couple more pieces it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.81" dur="4.86">getting clearer and clearer and as we</text>
  <text start="304.82" dur="5.96">keep adding these pieces together the</text>
  <text start="307.67" dur="7.08">puzzle is becoming clearer and clearer</text>
  <text start="310.78" dur="10.74">and we should be very very concerned</text>
  <text start="314.75" dur="12.15">about you know how the government is</text>
  <text start="321.52" dur="10.27">using these drones and we should we need</text>
  <text start="326.9" dur="11.16">to get clarity on what their intentions</text>
  <text start="331.79" dur="8.96">are because to me this just seems like</text>
  <text start="338.06" dur="11.01">we&amp;#39;re headed in one direction and one</text>
  <text start="340.75" dur="13.09">direction only now moving on now</text>
  <text start="349.07" dur="7.26">everything here is looking like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="353.84" dur="4.59">headed towards this huge economic</text>
  <text start="356.33" dur="3.87">collapse I mean you hear all the news i</text>
  <text start="358.43" dur="5.67">went through through yesterday in</text>
  <text start="360.2" dur="6.78">episode 15 you hear cypress here now</text>
  <text start="364.1" dur="7.89">venezuela wants to do the same thing as</text>
  <text start="366.98" dur="6.96">cypress and argentina all these</text>
  <text start="371.99" dur="4.68">countries are pretty much doing this as</text>
  <text start="373.94" dur="4.44">feeling pensions going after money in</text>
  <text start="376.67" dur="4.23">the bank they&amp;#39;re all doing the same</text>
  <text start="378.38" dur="4.47">exact thing there&amp;#39;s really they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="380.9" dur="3.87">jumping on the bandwagon it&amp;#39;s really not</text>
  <text start="382.85" dur="4.32">the countries of the central bankers the</text>
  <text start="384.77" dur="4.59">government&amp;#39;s and the central bank was</text>
  <text start="387.17" dur="4.2">really you know calling shots and</text>
  <text start="389.36" dur="5.76">telling them you know you owe us money</text>
  <text start="391.37" dur="7.17">so what are you going to do and but this</text>
  <text start="395.12" dur="6.69">is how you know when things start</text>
  <text start="398.54" dur="5.4">falling apart I mean the Fed had its</text>
  <text start="401.81" dur="4.05">meeting today and they said everything</text>
  <text start="403.94" dur="3.45">looks great and we&amp;#39;re just waiting for</text>
  <text start="405.86" dur="3.3">the unemployment to come down but</text>
  <text start="407.39" dur="3.87">everything is perfect beautiful we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="409.16" dur="5.43">going to keep doing what we&amp;#39;re doing but</text>
  <text start="411.26" dur="8.27">when we start hearing quotes from people</text>
  <text start="414.59" dur="7.77">in government or the Fed Chairman or</text>
  <text start="419.53" dur="3.759">anyone else and they start saying things</text>
  <text start="422.36" dur="3.299">like you</text>
  <text start="423.289" dur="3.96">when President Obama said you know that</text>
  <text start="425.659" dur="4.53">we don&amp;#39;t have an immediate crisis in</text>
  <text start="427.249" dur="4.44">terms of debt in fact added the</text>
  <text start="430.189" dur="6.35">president for the next 10 years it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="431.689" dur="8.1">going to be in a sustainable place now</text>
  <text start="436.539" dur="7.261">you know right there and then our debts</text>
  <text start="439.789" dur="6.93">approaching 17 trillion dollars it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="443.8" dur="5.259">it&amp;#39;s almost like a family who makes</text>
  <text start="446.719" dur="6.06">fifty thousand dollars a year and their</text>
  <text start="449.059" dur="6.06">debt is 200,000 this is going to be</text>
  <text start="452.779" dur="4.11">problems they can&amp;#39;t make the payments on</text>
  <text start="455.119" dur="3.42">the credit card to make those payments</text>
  <text start="456.889" dur="3.09">on the credit card they have to take</text>
  <text start="458.539" dur="3.12">another credit card out to make those</text>
  <text start="459.979" dur="6">payments and what happens that that</text>
  <text start="461.659" dur="6.51">keeps going up so his argument is for</text>
  <text start="465.979" dur="3.93">those people who are sleeping and they</text>
  <text start="468.169" dur="3.33">hear this and they go everything&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="469.909" dur="4.74">to be all right it&amp;#39;s almost like when</text>
  <text start="471.499" dur="5.13">the Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said he</text>
  <text start="474.649" dur="7.32">doesn&amp;#39;t see any evidence yet on a stock</text>
  <text start="476.629" dur="7.801">bubble now we&amp;#39;ve seen this in other</text>
  <text start="481.969" dur="7.32">episodes that I&amp;#39;ve done where they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="484.43" dur="6.359">always come out with quotes telling you</text>
  <text start="489.289" dur="3.84">that they don&amp;#39;t see any in this I mean</text>
  <text start="490.789" dur="5.19">Ben Bernanke before 2008 right before it</text>
  <text start="493.129" dur="5.58">he said there was no housing bubble but</text>
  <text start="495.979" dur="5.52">all the news and everything that that</text>
  <text start="498.709" dur="6.42">you heard especially everything that I</text>
  <text start="501.499" dur="6.96">said yesterday in episode 15 showed</text>
  <text start="505.129" dur="5.19">something different and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="508.459" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;re seeing today we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="510.319" dur="4.741">something different from what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="511.879" dur="5.34">saying and as they keep coming on with</text>
  <text start="515.06" dur="3.93">more and more quotes and more and more</text>
  <text start="517.219" dur="3.541">telling us that everything&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="518.99" dur="4.799">okay it&amp;#39;s almost like they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="520.76" dur="7.41">like Cyprus for instance this this is a</text>
  <text start="523.789" dur="7.681">one-off you no problem we won&amp;#39;t see this</text>
  <text start="528.17" dur="5.039">any we won&amp;#39;t see this again it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="531.47" dur="4.01">like when I said AI GL needs the one</text>
  <text start="533.209" dur="5.151">bailout we&amp;#39;ll only need the one QE</text>
  <text start="535.48" dur="7.69">Greece will only need one bailout it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="538.36" dur="7.479">all fake and phony people hear this and</text>
  <text start="543.17" dur="5.339">they say oh yeah those needed at the one</text>
  <text start="545.839" dur="5.25">time but it&amp;#39;s never the case and this is</text>
  <text start="548.509" dur="5.991">this is how they kick things this is how</text>
  <text start="551.089" dur="3.411">they kick the can down the street</text>
  <text start="555.3" dur="7.409">yesterday I talked about all the news</text>
  <text start="560.279" dur="4.521">and everything and I just wanted to add</text>
  <text start="562.709" dur="5.88">something to that and yesterday&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="564.8" dur="6.849">broadcast that basically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="568.589" dur="7.351">doing which they&amp;#39;ve done in 1929 2008</text>
  <text start="571.649" dur="7.261">and now today it&amp;#39;s a huge pump and dump</text>
  <text start="575.94" dur="3.99">scheme they build everything up even</text>
  <text start="578.91" dur="4.41">though it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what the news</text>
  <text start="579.93" dur="5.64">says how things are falling apart they</text>
  <text start="583.32" dur="4.139">build the stock market up as high as</text>
  <text start="585.57" dur="4.259">they possibly go and this time it is</text>
  <text start="587.459" dur="6.091">high and I think it&amp;#39;s even going to go</text>
  <text start="589.829" dur="8.611">higher depending on this Cypress Fiasco</text>
  <text start="593.55" dur="6.96">but I wanted to go back and and just</text>
  <text start="598.44" dur="3.78">look at you know have we seen this</text>
  <text start="600.51" dur="5.04">before now i know we&amp;#39;ve seen it you know</text>
  <text start="602.22" dur="8.059">1929 and the Dow hit an all-time high of</text>
  <text start="605.55" dur="12.45">381 and then in 32 a completely crashed</text>
  <text start="610.279" dur="13.571">1972 we finally went over 1,000 but 1974</text>
  <text start="618" dur="10.98">it crashed again in 1987 we finally got</text>
  <text start="623.85" dur="8.549">over the two thousand mark and then</text>
  <text start="628.98" dur="6">after that in late nineteen eighty-seven</text>
  <text start="632.399" dur="6.06">in october in January 1987 we hit the</text>
  <text start="634.98" dur="6.72">two thousand in late October of 1987 it</text>
  <text start="638.459" dur="5.581">we plunged and crashed again and then</text>
  <text start="641.7" dur="7.44">they started building it up building it</text>
  <text start="644.04" dur="9">up again and in the year 2000 2001 we</text>
  <text start="649.14" dur="11.16">finally hit 11,000 the highest it&amp;#39;s ever</text>
  <text start="653.04" dur="9.72">been and 2007 came along later in two</text>
  <text start="660.3" dur="5.34">thousand october two thousand seven we</text>
  <text start="662.76" dur="7.65">had 14,000 and then guess what happened</text>
  <text start="665.64" dur="9.24">in 2008-2009 a crash again and here we</text>
  <text start="670.41" dur="9.02">are today in 2013 they&amp;#39;re pumping this</text>
  <text start="674.88" dur="8.49">baby up and today it was around 14 5 and</text>
  <text start="679.43" dur="6.519">it&amp;#39;s going higher and higher and this is</text>
  <text start="683.37" dur="5.97">going to be the biggest pump and dump</text>
  <text start="685.949" dur="6.151">that we have ever seen I mean there</text>
  <text start="689.34" dur="7.29">I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if they get this</text>
  <text start="692.1" dur="6.33">to 16 15 16 and then it all comes</text>
  <text start="696.63" dur="8.67">crashing down if they can get it that</text>
  <text start="698.43" dur="9.45">high and I believe they&amp;#39;ll try so again</text>
  <text start="705.3" dur="6.03">as I always say history always repeats</text>
  <text start="707.88" dur="6.6">itself we can look at the past and we</text>
  <text start="711.33" dur="5.09">can see what they&amp;#39;re doing we can see</text>
  <text start="714.48" dur="4.88">the direction they&amp;#39;re heading in and</text>
  <text start="716.42" dur="6.79">this time I think this is the big one</text>
  <text start="719.36" dur="5.77">because it&amp;#39;s not just involving the u.s.</text>
  <text start="723.21" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s not just involving a little housing</text>
  <text start="725.13" dur="7.56">but it&amp;#39;s the entire world this time the</text>
  <text start="728.85" dur="8.01">entire world is struggling needing</text>
  <text start="732.69" dur="7.14">bailouts and everything today is</text>
  <text start="736.86" dur="6.24">connected and it&amp;#39;s connected more so</text>
  <text start="739.83" dur="5.39">than ever before and this time when it</text>
  <text start="743.1" dur="6.51">comes down it&amp;#39;s going to come down</text>
  <text start="745.22" dur="8.38">really really fast and hard and people</text>
  <text start="749.61" dur="6.42">are going to be shocked and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
