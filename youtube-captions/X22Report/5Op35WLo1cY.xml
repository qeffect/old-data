  <text start="86.27" dur="5.099">either direction depending on how</text>
  <text start="88.07" dur="4.92">everything unfolds now what is happening</text>

  <text start="128.21" dur="3.39">time it was reported that PayPal filed a</text>
  <text start="130.22" dur="3.99">patent application related to</text>

  <text start="149.09" dur="6.27">cryptocurrency ecosystem with a new</text>
  <text start="152.36" dur="4.349">system for speedy transactions and when</text>
  <text start="155.36" dur="2.97">I think is happening right now is</text>
  <text start="156.709" dur="4.171">they&amp;#39;re starting to realize that the</text>
  <text start="158.33" dur="6.32">crypto market is going to play a very</text>
  <text start="160.88" dur="6.75">very important role in the next economic</text>
  <text start="164.65" dur="5.11">system and these corporations are</text>
  <text start="167.63" dur="4.439">looking at this and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="169.76" dur="4.71">realizing they need to get on board now</text>
  <text start="172.069" dur="4.14">if we stay with the Fayette system like</text>
  <text start="174.47" dur="3.9">the central bankers want us to stay in</text>
  <text start="176.209" dur="4.411">that direction they will probably</text>
  <text start="178.37" dur="6.869">introduce some form of cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="180.62" dur="5.52">but it will be theirs now remember they</text>
  <text start="185.239" dur="4.111">can have</text>
  <text start="186.14" dur="6.36">government signed into law where they</text>
  <text start="189.35" dur="4.98">say you have every person has to use</text>
  <text start="192.5" dur="6.06">this cryptocurrency they did it back in</text>
  <text start="194.33" dur="9.6">1913 where they said okay everyone will</text>
  <text start="198.56" dur="7.8">use our printed dollar that is the</text>
  <text start="203.93" dur="4.2">currency period they can do the same</text>
  <text start="206.36" dur="3.66">thing with cryptocurrency and this is</text>
  <text start="208.13" dur="4.68">why we see their this is why we see</text>
  <text start="210.02" dur="5.189">there&amp;#39;s a battle going on between the</text>
  <text start="212.81" dur="5.04">finance system and the cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="215.209" dur="5.28">system and this battle is going to wage</text>
  <text start="217.85" dur="5.07">on as we move forward now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="220.489" dur="5.161">looking at many different indicators and</text>
  <text start="222.92" dur="5.69">each indicator lets us know that things</text>
  <text start="225.65" dur="5.13">are deteriorating very very quickly and</text>
  <text start="228.61" dur="4.03">one of the indicators that we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="230.78" dur="3.48">at right now which is a leading</text>
  <text start="232.64" dur="4.5">indicator this is why the Fed gets</text>
  <text start="234.26" dur="5.91">worried when this indicator flashes red</text>
  <text start="237.14" dur="5.61">well that&amp;#39;s credit problems and credit</text>
  <text start="240.17" dur="4.83">problems always appear first at the</text>
  <text start="242.75" dur="5.489">margins now the credit problem appear</text>
  <text start="245" dur="3.9">first among the most fragile most at</text>
  <text start="248.239" dur="4.111">risk</text>
  <text start="248.9" dur="6">most strung out borrowers with subprime</text>
  <text start="252.35" dur="5.819">credit ratings and the small banks and</text>
  <text start="254.9" dur="5.16">bigger banks they went after these types</text>
  <text start="258.169" dur="4.441">of people very very aggressively and</text>
  <text start="260.06" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;re starting to see there&amp;#39;s a major</text>
  <text start="262.61" dur="4.95">problem in this area now small banks</text>
  <text start="265.55" dur="4.44">they pushed with all their might into</text>
  <text start="267.56" dur="4.01">credit cards loosening credit standards</text>
  <text start="269.99" dur="3.9">lowering credit score requirements</text>
  <text start="271.57" dur="5.02">raising credit limits and offering new</text>
  <text start="273.89" dur="4.65">cards to people who already had maxed</text>
  <text start="276.59" dur="3.66">out their existing cards and added</text>
  <text start="278.54" dur="4.41">limited or no ability to service them</text>
  <text start="280.25" dur="6.36">from their income and no way of paying</text>
  <text start="282.95" dur="6.39">them off and thus are stuck with a huge</text>
  <text start="286.61" dur="5.52">amount of debt and their balances are</text>
  <text start="289.34" dur="6.27">very high interest rates are very high</text>
  <text start="292.13" dur="6.659">and these individuals are in trouble</text>
  <text start="295.61" dur="5.85">now for small banks it was the holy</text>
  <text start="298.789" dur="5.341">grail to profit from the American debt</text>
  <text start="301.46" dur="4.05">slave there are about four thousand</text>
  <text start="304.13" dur="3.87">eight hundred and eighty eight</text>
  <text start="305.51" dur="4.92">commercial banks in the u.s. there are</text>
  <text start="308" dur="3.9">the top 100 banks and then there are</text>
  <text start="310.43" dur="5.07">four thousand seven hundred eighty eight</text>
  <text start="311.9" dur="6.3">smaller banks those with less than 14</text>
  <text start="315.5" dur="4.05">billion in assets now we need to</text>
  <text start="318.2" dur="3.48">remember that</text>
  <text start="319.55" dur="4.2">these banks they were paying next to</text>
  <text start="321.68" dur="4.74">nothing in interest to their depositors</text>
  <text start="323.75" dur="4.74">but they could charge 25 or 30 percent</text>
  <text start="326.42" dur="4.2">interest on outstanding credit card</text>
  <text start="328.49" dur="4.65">balances the interest rate spread</text>
  <text start="330.62" dur="5.97">between these two products was was</text>
  <text start="333.14" dur="6.6">incredible and this is why they loved it</text>
  <text start="336.59" dur="6.3">they loved what was going on</text>
  <text start="339.74" dur="6.05">now small banks are getting their clocks</text>
  <text start="342.89" dur="6.12">cleaned by these American debt slaves</text>
  <text start="345.79" dur="6.64">because what is happening right now well</text>
  <text start="349.01" dur="5.64">a lot of these individuals they&amp;#39;re maxed</text>
  <text start="352.43" dur="5.61">out we&amp;#39;re seeing a huge</text>
  <text start="354.65" dur="5.85">charge-off rate right now and people are</text>
  <text start="358.04" dur="5.37">in trouble and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="360.5" dur="6.54">that these banks these smaller banks</text>
  <text start="363.41" dur="8.01">they are writing off a lot of these</text>
  <text start="367.04" dur="6.51">credit card failures now the banks have</text>
  <text start="371.42" dur="6.03">been writing off losses and they spiked</text>
  <text start="373.55" dur="6.27">to around 7.5% in the third quarter and</text>
  <text start="377.45" dur="4.74">7.4 percent in the fourth quarter and</text>
  <text start="379.82" dur="4.74">this is coming from the Fed Board of</text>
  <text start="382.19" dur="4.14">Governors those were the highest</text>
  <text start="384.56" dur="4.62">charge-off rates since the second</text>
  <text start="386.33" dur="5.88">quarter of 2010 up from 4.6 percent a</text>
  <text start="389.18" dur="5.61">year earlier and up from 3.5%</text>
  <text start="392.21" dur="5.61">two years earlier credit card charge</text>
  <text start="394.79" dur="6.03">wharfs at the largest 100 banks are also</text>
  <text start="397.82" dur="5.19">increasing but very slowly because what</text>
  <text start="400.82" dur="4.62">they did was they offloaded the weight</text>
  <text start="403.01" dur="4.32">of who took out a credit card and who</text>
  <text start="405.44" dur="4.47">handed out a credit card over to the</text>
  <text start="407.33" dur="4.62">smaller banks so the bigger banks didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="409.91" dur="4.17">have to feel the brunt of all of this</text>
  <text start="411.95" dur="6.9">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="414.08" dur="7.05">something very similar to the 2008 Great</text>
  <text start="418.85" dur="4.92">Recession where we saw charged-off rates</text>
  <text start="421.13" dur="4.89">at small banks well they hit a peak</text>
  <text start="423.77" dur="4.5">around eight point eight percent of the</text>
  <text start="426.02" dur="4.86">fourth quarter of 2009 so we&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="428.27" dur="4.71">close to eight point eight percent were</text>
  <text start="430.88" dur="4.74">already at seven point four percent and</text>
  <text start="432.98" dur="6.33">it&amp;#39;s continually trending higher and</text>
  <text start="435.62" dur="4.92">higher now the smaller banks the four</text>
  <text start="439.31" dur="3.54">thousand seven hundred and eighty eight</text>
  <text start="440.54" dur="4.23">smaller banks they hold a very small</text>
  <text start="442.85" dur="4.23">portion of all banking assets including</text>
  <text start="444.77" dur="3.99">credit card balances so this might not</text>
  <text start="447.08" dur="4.02">even jeopardize the financial system but</text>
  <text start="448.76" dur="3.98">the surge in charge-offs</text>
  <text start="451.1" dur="3.71">at these banks</text>
  <text start="452.74" dur="5.01">does give a glimpse at the credit</text>
  <text start="454.81" dur="5.97">problems at the margin and this is a</text>
  <text start="457.75" dur="4.41">leading indicator for a broader cycle</text>
  <text start="460.78" dur="5.19">because we saw the same thing happened</text>
  <text start="462.16" dur="5.28">back prior to 2008 now it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="465.97" dur="4.5">who&amp;#39;s holding the credit cards right now</text>
  <text start="467.44" dur="4.47">which bank but what the the most</text>
  <text start="470.47" dur="3.93">important thing is that these</text>
  <text start="471.91" dur="4.979">credit-card charge offs they are rising</text>
  <text start="474.4" dur="4.169">very very quickly and this is exactly</text>
  <text start="476.889" dur="4.5">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now and this is</text>
  <text start="478.569" dur="5.94">another indicator to let us know we are</text>
  <text start="481.389" dur="7.041">back to where we were now everyone is</text>
  <text start="484.509" dur="5.791">out there and the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="488.43" dur="4.6">government with their manipulative</text>
  <text start="490.3" dur="4.26">statistics the Federal Reserve you know</text>
  <text start="493.03" dur="2.94">everyone&amp;#39;s looking at everything saying</text>
  <text start="494.56" dur="2.789">everything is pretty good except for the</text>
  <text start="495.97" dur="7.41">stock market it&amp;#39;s bobbing up and down</text>
  <text start="497.349" dur="9.47">and no one is realizing that we are back</text>
  <text start="503.38" dur="6.27">in the same exact position as we were</text>
  <text start="506.819" dur="5.291">prior to 2008 but this time it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="509.65" dur="4.829">worse because the banks are completely</text>
  <text start="512.11" dur="5.07">insolvent there&amp;#39;s a lot more people out</text>
  <text start="514.479" dur="6.391">of work we have a lot more debt the Fed</text>
  <text start="517.18" dur="5.46">used all its tricks and brought the</text>
  <text start="520.87" dur="5.04">interest rates to the lowest level we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="522.64" dur="6.09">seen in like forever and right now we</text>
  <text start="525.91" dur="6.44">are in trouble and the Trump</text>
  <text start="528.73" dur="7.65">administration they understand this and</text>
  <text start="532.35" dur="7.989">what they are doing right now is they</text>
  <text start="536.38" dur="8.699">are pushing the entire system to the</text>
  <text start="540.339" dur="7.5">edge and this is why they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="545.079" dur="4.861">tariffs reciprocal taxes because you</text>
  <text start="547.839" dur="4.651">have to remember the system were in</text>
  <text start="549.94" dur="4.32">needs to be destroyed this is not a</text>
  <text start="552.49" dur="4.68">system for the people it was never</text>
  <text start="554.26" dur="6.24">designed to be for the people it was</text>
  <text start="557.17" dur="7.95">designed for the elite the deep state</text>
  <text start="560.5" dur="7.26">and the rest and to get rid of all of</text>
  <text start="565.12" dur="5.58">these individuals you need to cut off</text>
  <text start="567.76" dur="4.519">their funding this is what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="570.7" dur="4.44">right now and I said time and time again</text>
  <text start="572.279" dur="5.921">Andrew Jackson is hanging on the wall in</text>
  <text start="575.14" dur="5.189">the White House in Trump&amp;#39;s office</text>
  <text start="578.2" dur="3.78">there&amp;#39;s a reason for it because Andrew</text>
  <text start="580.329" dur="4.111">Jackson campaign on getting rid of the</text>
  <text start="581.98" dur="3.97">central bank and I do believe this is</text>
  <text start="584.44" dur="4.69">where Trump is headed now</text>
  <text start="585.95" dur="5.07">there are many corporate media articles</text>
  <text start="589.13" dur="3.78">out there saying that you know Trump</text>
  <text start="591.02" dur="4.89">saying like you know Terrace will only</text>
  <text start="592.91" dur="5.88">come off if a new fair NAFTA is signed</text>
  <text start="595.91" dur="4.98">he doesn&amp;#39;t even want after the only</text>
  <text start="598.79" dur="5.04">reason he had to go into negotiations is</text>
  <text start="600.89" dur="4.77">because of all the interlinking that</text>
  <text start="603.83" dur="3.99">went on with Congress where it was very</text>
  <text start="605.66" dur="3.96">difficult just to say let&amp;#39;s scrap it</text>
  <text start="607.82" dur="3.81">they did this on purpose to make it very</text>
  <text start="609.62" dur="3.78">difficult to get rid of it and what</text>
  <text start="611.63" dur="4.35">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="613.4" dur="4.8">that no we&amp;#39;re going forward with this he</text>
  <text start="615.98" dur="3.54">doesn&amp;#39;t care and when I mean by that</text>
  <text start="618.2" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s not that he doesn&amp;#39;t care about the</text>
  <text start="619.52" dur="5.4">people he doesn&amp;#39;t care about the</text>
  <text start="622.22" dur="4.83">establishments system the central</text>
  <text start="624.92" dur="3.78">banking system why do you think the</text>
  <text start="627.05" dur="3.09">corporate media and all these</text>
  <text start="628.7" dur="3.57">individuals are screaming and yelling</text>
  <text start="630.14" dur="4.41">and everything like that because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="632.27" dur="4.11">very nervous and afraid on what is going</text>
  <text start="634.55" dur="5.25">on right now they know what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="636.38" dur="5.85">right now and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="639.8" dur="5.43">individuals within government everyone</text>
  <text start="642.23" dur="5.19">is starting to take sides because we</text>
  <text start="645.23" dur="5.82">need to understand that when we have a</text>
  <text start="647.42" dur="6.57">reset in the economy it&amp;#39;s not just a</text>
  <text start="651.05" dur="7.47">reset in the economy it&amp;#39;s a reset in</text>
  <text start="653.99" dur="8.31">government a reset in who is in office a</text>
  <text start="658.52" dur="5.97">reset on everything and these</text>
  <text start="662.3" dur="3.69">individuals now they&amp;#39;re starting to take</text>
  <text start="664.49" dur="3.09">sides I mean Paul Ryan is out there</text>
  <text start="665.99" dur="3.75">saying no this is a really bad deal we</text>
  <text start="667.58" dur="4.35">shouldn&amp;#39;t do this on and on and on and</text>
  <text start="669.74" dur="6.41">we can see right now that they have</text>
  <text start="671.93" dur="7.23">certain groups certain entities certain</text>
  <text start="676.15" dur="5.26">obligations that they have to go along</text>
  <text start="679.16" dur="6.93">with and this is why they&amp;#39;re voicing</text>
  <text start="681.41" dur="7.53">concerns now we see right now that this</text>
  <text start="686.09" dur="5.46">entire market and this is all about</text>
  <text start="688.94" dur="6.54">bringing it all down and how everything</text>
  <text start="691.55" dur="9.75">is repeating itself once again now the</text>
  <text start="695.48" dur="8.76">markets from 1929 1987 and today look</text>
  <text start="701.3" dur="6.99">very very similar I mean if we look at</text>
  <text start="704.24" dur="9.72">the S&amp;amp;P 500 and the Dow from 1987 the SP</text>
  <text start="708.29" dur="9.66">500 now the Dow in 1929 the graphs look</text>
  <text start="713.96" dur="5.63">almost identical where we have the</text>
  <text start="717.95" dur="6.94">bubble pushing the market</text>
  <text start="719.59" dur="8.49">up we have a couple dead cat bounces and</text>
  <text start="724.89" dur="5.74">then the whole market comes down the</text>
  <text start="728.08" dur="5.7">only difference today is that they have</text>
  <text start="730.63" dur="6.21">a better understanding of how to control</text>
  <text start="733.78" dur="5.25">and how to manipulate the market but the</text>
  <text start="736.84" dur="4.59">most important point of all this is that</text>
  <text start="739.03" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re doing the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="741.43" dur="3.48">eventually what they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="742.87" dur="3.21">bring it down they want control the</text>
  <text start="744.91" dur="2.52">narrative when I say they it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="746.08" dur="3.81">central banking system the deep state</text>
  <text start="747.43" dur="4.5">they want control of the narrative and</text>
  <text start="749.89" dur="3.99">this is why they&amp;#39;re trying to maneuver</text>
  <text start="751.93" dur="3.96">and set everything up but it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="753.88" dur="5.49">very very difficult because there is a</text>
  <text start="755.89" dur="5.43">race to shut this whole thing down and</text>
  <text start="759.37" dur="4.26">they realize it and they understand it</text>
  <text start="761.32" dur="4.08">now when the central bankers shut it</text>
  <text start="763.63" dur="4.92">down they&amp;#39;re not going to be shutting</text>
  <text start="765.4" dur="5.4">down their system they need to reset and</text>
  <text start="768.55" dur="5.52">move it someplace else because the</text>
  <text start="770.8" dur="6.45">system is dead in the water plus it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="774.07" dur="5.88">great distraction plus it will clog the</text>
  <text start="777.25" dur="5.25">new cycles plus they can point the</text>
  <text start="779.95" dur="4.53">finger and blame it some on someone else</text>
  <text start="782.5" dur="3.81">most likely Trump and then have another</text>
  <text start="784.48" dur="3.75">country maybe to blame on with a</text>
  <text start="786.31" dur="4.41">cyberattack into the financial systems</text>
  <text start="788.23" dur="4.71">which they&amp;#39;re pushing right now Trump on</text>
  <text start="790.72" dur="4.32">the other hand he&amp;#39;s maneuvering right</text>
  <text start="792.94" dur="4.8">now saying that everything that they set</text>
  <text start="795.04" dur="6.63">up right now is completely unfair and to</text>
  <text start="797.74" dur="8.55">make it fair we need to basically tax</text>
  <text start="801.67" dur="8.25">and place taxes on imports coming into</text>
  <text start="806.29" dur="5.64">this country and the reason why the</text>
  <text start="809.92" dur="3.78">central bankers didn&amp;#39;t do that because</text>
  <text start="811.93" dur="4.86">they didn&amp;#39;t care about that they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="813.7" dur="4.98">care how the system worked actually they</text>
  <text start="816.79" dur="3.87">were in the process of moving everything</text>
  <text start="818.68" dur="3.87">out of this country that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="820.66" dur="3.51">didn&amp;#39;t care because they knew that this</text>
  <text start="822.55" dur="2.91">would only keep for a certain period of</text>
  <text start="824.17" dur="2.97">time they have to move it off and this</text>
  <text start="825.46" dur="4.65">is why they&amp;#39;ve been moving manufacturing</text>
  <text start="827.14" dur="6.45">setting up NAFTA they wanted TPP this</text>
  <text start="830.11" dur="6.75">was all part of their plan and here we</text>
  <text start="833.59" dur="7.23">are today and we can see right now it is</text>
  <text start="836.86" dur="7.32">a race to see who controls the narrative</text>
  <text start="840.82" dur="7.32">who brings the system down and we see</text>
  <text start="844.18" dur="5.37">right now that the system is completely</text>
  <text start="848.14" dur="2.88">unbalanced and what Trump is doing right</text>
  <text start="849.55" dur="2.28">now because we don&amp;#39;t have manufacturing</text>
  <text start="851.02" dur="3.629">here anymore</text>
  <text start="851.83" dur="6.06">we don&amp;#39;t have a trade system we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="854.649" dur="5.041">have anything and when the system is</text>
  <text start="857.89" dur="4.139">reset when we go through this gigantic</text>
  <text start="859.69" dur="5.73">reset the United States needs to be</text>
  <text start="862.029" dur="5.49">prepared to be on the new system might</text>
  <text start="865.42" dur="4.26">be a crypto system we know that China</text>
  <text start="867.519" dur="3.721">most likely is going to have all the</text>
  <text start="869.68" dur="3.87">trade they have all the manufacturing</text>
  <text start="871.24" dur="3.75">they have a belt and Road and yes the</text>
  <text start="873.55" dur="4.289">United States is going to have to join</text>
  <text start="874.99" dur="4.26">eventually and we&amp;#39;re gonna have to start</text>
  <text start="877.839" dur="3.87">to bring manufacturing back to this</text>
  <text start="879.25" dur="5.76">country everything has to be reversed</text>
  <text start="881.709" dur="5.791">and this is not for this system that</text>
  <text start="885.01" dur="5.37">we&amp;#39;re in right now this is all being set</text>
  <text start="887.5" dur="5.61">up for the next system and we are</text>
  <text start="890.38" dur="4.5">getting very very close to that point in</text>
  <text start="893.11" dur="5.28">time and this is why we see all of this</text>
  <text start="894.88" dur="6.81">chaos happening right now because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="898.39" dur="4.949">at the end stage and this is what it</text>
  <text start="901.69" dur="5.28">looks like when you&amp;#39;re at the end stage</text>
  <text start="903.339" dur="5.281">go back in history you&amp;#39;ll see it tariffs</text>
  <text start="906.97" dur="3.54">and a lot of people saying that this is</text>
  <text start="908.62" dur="2.52">going to lead to war but I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="910.51" dur="3.72">Russia</text>
  <text start="911.14" dur="4.77">I don&amp;#39;t think China they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="914.23" dur="3.99">move towards war the only reason we went</text>
  <text start="915.91" dur="6.21">to war before is because the central</text>
  <text start="918.22" dur="5.19">bankers pushed it in that direction so</text>
  <text start="922.12" dur="3.63">that they could have this gigantic</text>
  <text start="923.41" dur="4.77">distraction so they can move the</text>
  <text start="925.75" dur="4.56">economic system someplace else because</text>
  <text start="928.18" dur="5.61">they knew their system was dead in that</text>
  <text start="930.31" dur="6.029">certain area this time what Trump is</text>
  <text start="933.79" dur="5.46">hoping to do is to shut down that part</text>
  <text start="936.339" dur="7.021">of it hopefully he succeeds where we</text>
  <text start="939.25" dur="6.72">don&amp;#39;t have any type of of an event that</text>
  <text start="943.36" dur="5.4">brings us into any type of war but we</text>
  <text start="945.97" dur="6.27">can see right now we are headed to a</text>
  <text start="948.76" dur="5.37">major calamity we can see that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="952.24" dur="4.83">going to either be a very very hard</text>
  <text start="954.13" dur="4.44">landing or a little bit softer but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="957.07" dur="2.55">still going to go through a transition a</text>
  <text start="958.57" dur="4.05">lot of people going to lose their wealth</text>
  <text start="959.62" dur="5.31">the value of the dollars gonna lose its</text>
  <text start="962.62" dur="5.01">value very very quickly yes we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="964.93" dur="4.68">to see inflation yes it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="967.63" dur="4.139">difficult yes credits going to freeze up</text>
  <text start="969.61" dur="4.38">yes it&amp;#39;s going to be very difficult to</text>
  <text start="971.769" dur="5.43">get oil into the country but don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="973.99" dur="6.18">we have oil in this country to protect</text>
  <text start="977.199" dur="5.431">against that but it&amp;#39;s going to be a very</text>
  <text start="980.17" dur="4.44">difficult time and if you remember back</text>
  <text start="982.63" dur="3.03">in 1971 and I mentioned this many times</text>
  <text start="984.61" dur="2.82">before</text>
  <text start="985.66" dur="4.05">when we were going off the gold standard</text>
  <text start="987.43" dur="4.47">onto the petrodollar system that was in</text>
  <text start="989.71" dur="4.5">the beginning stages of their new system</text>
  <text start="991.9" dur="4.53">we were still the reserve currency just</text>
  <text start="994.21" dur="4.17">that the dollar was now bought back by</text>
  <text start="996.43" dur="4.41">oil and the Full Faith Credit of the</text>
  <text start="998.38" dur="4.05">United States but we went through a</text>
  <text start="1000.84" dur="4.02">little bit of a problem there where was</text>
  <text start="1002.43" dur="4.05">how high employment high unemployment I</text>
  <text start="1004.86" dur="3.12">should say they had to raise the</text>
  <text start="1006.48" dur="2.79">interest rates correct quite a bit</text>
  <text start="1007.98" dur="4.05">because they were printing money like</text>
  <text start="1009.27" dur="5.76">crazy so we saw inflation that&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="1012.03" dur="4.86">the value of the dollar was losing its</text>
  <text start="1015.03" dur="3.24">value very very quickly right in the</text>
  <text start="1016.89" dur="4.56">beating once we came off that gold</text>
  <text start="1018.27" dur="4.44">standard here we&amp;#39;re at the end they have</text>
  <text start="1021.45" dur="3.18">no place to bring the interest rates</text>
  <text start="1022.71" dur="3.6">except lower they can&amp;#39;t bring them up</text>
  <text start="1024.63" dur="3.03">any more as you can see the housing</text>
  <text start="1026.31" dur="3.69">markets falling apart as they bring the</text>
  <text start="1027.66" dur="5.97">interest rates up this is what it looks</text>
  <text start="1030" dur="5.22">like at the end of the system where the</text>
  <text start="1033.63" dur="3.78">market they push up as high as they</text>
  <text start="1035.22" dur="4.229">possibly can it&amp;#39;s completely meaningless</text>
  <text start="1037.41" dur="3.39">because most of the Corporations they</text>
  <text start="1039.449" dur="3.99">don&amp;#39;t have the sales actually look at</text>
  <text start="1040.8" dur="5.25">UPS FEDEX and the rest their sales are</text>
  <text start="1043.439" dur="4.051">not that great with you know shipping</text>
  <text start="1046.05" dur="3.18">packages all the place now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1047.49" dur="3.3">blaming it on Amazon because now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1049.23" dur="5.07">shipping so they&amp;#39;re getting into the the</text>
  <text start="1050.79" dur="6.6">whole thing is to keep you confused if</text>
  <text start="1054.3" dur="7.35">online businesses are doing so wonderful</text>
  <text start="1057.39" dur="7.53">and everyone is shipping why are these</text>
  <text start="1061.65" dur="5.28">companies having a problem it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="1064.92" dur="5.27">Amazon there are many companies out</text>
  <text start="1066.93" dur="7.44">there that do shipping that sell online</text>
  <text start="1070.19" dur="6.37">so once again they&amp;#39;re confusing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1074.37" dur="3.96">making us believe that something is</text>
  <text start="1076.56" dur="2.94">happening when it really isn&amp;#39;t just like</text>
  <text start="1078.33" dur="2.82">back in nineteen seventy one they told</text>
  <text start="1079.5" dur="3.33">you it was all a gas shortage we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1081.15" dur="4.5">find any more oil I don&amp;#39;t know where it</text>
  <text start="1082.83" dur="6.06">is and then how many years later we have</text>
  <text start="1085.65" dur="5.22">plenty of oil come on we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1088.89" dur="5.25">through a transition right now and</text>
  <text start="1090.87" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re trying to confuse people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1094.14" dur="4.44">going to be using chaos and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1096.63" dur="3.78">to be a very rough period this is why</text>
  <text start="1098.58" dur="2.7">you need to be prepared with food water</text>
  <text start="1100.41" dur="4.5">supplies</text>
  <text start="1101.28" dur="6.66">gold silver cryptocurrency cash on hand</text>

  <text start="1109.29" dur="4.23">to protect yourself with all of that</text>
