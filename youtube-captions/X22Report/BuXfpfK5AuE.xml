  <text start="53.16" dur="5.28">hi and welcome you&amp;#39;re listening to the X</text>
  <text start="56.67" dur="5.55">when heater report my name is Dave and</text>
  <text start="58.44" dur="6.93">this is episode 1544 bien today&amp;#39;s date</text>
  <text start="62.22" dur="6.24">is April 13th 2018 and the top of the</text>
  <text start="65.37" dur="7.05">episode is the strategy is set strike</text>
  <text start="68.46" dur="6.3">group on its way trust the plan let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="72.42" dur="4.65">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="74.76" dur="4.859">and geopolitical news now it looks like</text>
  <text start="77.07" dur="4.74">the deep state they are becoming very</text>
  <text start="79.619" dur="6">very desperate especially with this raid</text>
  <text start="81.81" dur="5.85">on Trump&amp;#39;s attorney Cohen&amp;#39;s office which</text>
  <text start="85.619" dur="3.811">is an attack on attorney-client</text>
  <text start="87.66" dur="3.54">privileges had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="89.43" dur="4.32">Russian collusion whatsoever</text>
  <text start="91.2" dur="4.98">and this just shows you that the</text>
  <text start="93.75" dur="4.619">investigation has hit a roadblock they</text>
  <text start="96.18" dur="4.89">don&amp;#39;t know where to go and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="98.369" dur="6.181">trying to do whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="101.07" dur="6.659">to force Trump&amp;#39;s hand and we could see</text>
  <text start="104.55" dur="6.54">that Trump kind of fired back and sent</text>
  <text start="107.729" dur="6.301">Mueller a message by issuing a pardon</text>
  <text start="111.09" dur="7.8">for George W Bush staffer Scooter Libby</text>
  <text start="114.03" dur="6.679">and Libby was himself unfairly targeted</text>
  <text start="118.89" dur="5.039">by special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald</text>
  <text start="120.709" dur="6.131">who was coincidentally appointed by</text>
  <text start="123.929" dur="5.25">James Comey in 2003 to investigate the</text>
  <text start="126.84" dur="6.18">leak of the name of then CIA employee</text>
  <text start="129.179" dur="5.221">Valerie Plame Libby was later prosecuted</text>
  <text start="133.02" dur="3.18">and convicted of lying</text>
  <text start="134.4" dur="4.43">despite findings that he himself was not</text>
  <text start="136.2" dur="6.75">responsible for leaking claims identity</text>
  <text start="138.83" dur="6.28">false testimony was coerced by James</text>
  <text start="142.95" dur="4.02">commis friend Patrick Fitzgerald and</text>
  <text start="145.11" dur="3.66">Comey was part of the team to destroy</text>
  <text start="146.97" dur="5.519">the vice president of the United States</text>
  <text start="148.77" dur="6">and it didn&amp;#39;t happen some say he was</text>
  <text start="152.489" dur="4.021">railroaded and this is scooter literally</text>
  <text start="154.77" dur="4.38">largely because of his association with</text>
  <text start="156.51" dur="5.22">the Bush White House and the involvement</text>
  <text start="159.15" dur="4.83">of Comey is striking in its parallel to</text>
  <text start="161.73" dur="4.89">the ongoing investigation by special</text>
  <text start="163.98" dur="4.38">counsel Robert Mueller Trump has</text>
  <text start="166.62" dur="4.619">repeatedly characterized the sprawling</text>
  <text start="168.36" dur="5.61">investigation as a witch-hunt and it</text>
  <text start="171.239" dur="7.651">looks like Bueller is completely off the</text>
  <text start="173.97" dur="6.96">track of finding out if Trump colluded</text>
  <text start="178.89" dur="4.14">with Russia and I think Mueller has</text>
  <text start="180.93" dur="4.08">figured out and probably already known</text>
  <text start="183.03" dur="3.02">for a very long time there has never</text>
  <text start="185.01" dur="5.57">been</text>
  <text start="186.05" dur="8.79">type of Russian collusion and now his</text>
  <text start="190.58" dur="6.63">mission has changed and you can see</text>
  <text start="194.84" dur="6.77">right now by him doing all this other</text>
  <text start="197.21" dur="7.8">stuff it has gone way off the track of</text>
  <text start="201.61" dur="5.68">investigating Russian collusion now we</text>
  <text start="205.01" dur="5.73">see the deep state they have not given</text>
  <text start="207.29" dur="5.58">up at all with North Korea well they</text>
  <text start="210.74" dur="4.98">can&amp;#39;t go down the path of no nuclear</text>
  <text start="212.87" dur="5.82">weapons because kim jung-eun already had</text>
  <text start="215.72" dur="6.72">the peace talks with President Trump</text>
  <text start="218.69" dur="5.85">with Xi Jingping with Putin in the</text>
  <text start="222.44" dur="3.75">Forbidden City even though they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="224.54" dur="3.3">setting up a summit everything else was</text>
  <text start="226.19" dur="3.99">done in the background that&amp;#39;s all for</text>
  <text start="227.84" dur="4.5">show that&amp;#39;s coming up now and this is</text>
  <text start="230.18" dur="4.29">why when there is the military drill</text>
  <text start="232.34" dur="3.99">going on which is still going on Kim</text>
  <text start="234.47" dur="4.32">Jung Woon has said absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="236.33" dur="4.29">they haven&amp;#39;t fired a missile tested a</text>
  <text start="238.79" dur="4.02">nuclear weapon and they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="240.62" dur="5.61">denuclearization but the deep state</text>
  <text start="242.81" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re pushing another angle and from</text>
  <text start="246.23" dur="4.14">intelligence reports documents attained</text>
  <text start="248.9" dur="2.97">by foreign policy from the Department of</text>
  <text start="250.37" dur="4.41">Homeland Security issued in December</text>
  <text start="251.87" dur="5.64">last year indicate that advanced</text>
  <text start="254.78" dur="5.429">persistent threat actors are using newly</text>
  <text start="257.51" dur="5.43">discovered destructive malware that</text>
  <text start="260.209" dur="7.011">shares a number of similarities to the</text>
  <text start="262.94" dur="9.03">malware that was used with the Sony</text>
  <text start="267.22" dur="6.55">attack now what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="271.97" dur="3.99">trying to link this to North Korea now</text>
  <text start="273.77" dur="3.87">we know what the Sony Entertainment this</text>
  <text start="275.96" dur="3.87">was not North Korea they could care less</text>
  <text start="277.64" dur="3.99">about that movie that came out that went</text>
  <text start="279.83" dur="5.85">absolutely nowhere this was a</text>
  <text start="281.63" dur="6">disgruntled employee that did the attack</text>
  <text start="285.68" dur="3.989">on Sony had nothing to do with North</text>
  <text start="287.63" dur="3.36">Korea but you know a couple days later</text>
  <text start="289.669" dur="3.301">they said it was North Korea because</text>
  <text start="290.99" dur="3.75">they needed to point a finger and we</text>
  <text start="292.97" dur="3.48">know what they wanted to do they were</text>
  <text start="294.74" dur="4.29">building a case of why we would have to</text>
  <text start="296.45" dur="3.93">invade North Korea eventually so what</text>
  <text start="299.03" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="300.38" dur="7.74">trying to make a case of why North Korea</text>
  <text start="304.79" dur="5.22">is going to hit the power infrastructure</text>
  <text start="308.12" dur="4.14">going to hit the financial institutions</text>
  <text start="310.01" dur="4.29">and they&amp;#39;re building this up because</text>
  <text start="312.26" dur="5.85">they can&amp;#39;t use the nuclear angle any</text>
  <text start="314.3" dur="5.28">more that&amp;#39;s completely out now in Syria</text>
  <text start="318.11" dur="4.35">it looks like Russia</text>
  <text start="319.58" dur="5.19">is coming out and they are hitting this</text>
  <text start="322.46" dur="3.84">chemical attack strong and hard and</text>
  <text start="324.77" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re saying listen we have</text>
  <text start="326.3" dur="6.179">irrefutable data that the incident in</text>
  <text start="329.3" dur="5.639">Duma was staged by the intelligence</text>
  <text start="332.479" dur="5.611">services of a foreign state pushing a</text>
  <text start="334.939" dur="6.301">Russia phobic campaign this is coming</text>
  <text start="338.09" dur="6.389">from Sergey Lavrov now he is pointing</text>
  <text start="341.24" dur="6.51">towards the UK saying that they are the</text>
  <text start="344.479" dur="6.69">ones that pushed this entire staged</text>
  <text start="347.75" dur="5.19">event now we need to remember as soon as</text>
  <text start="351.169" dur="3.271">Trump said we&amp;#39;re gonna be pulling the</text>
  <text start="352.94" dur="2.61">troops out of there all of a sudden we</text>
  <text start="354.44" dur="6.599">had this false flag now we know that</text>
  <text start="355.55" dur="9.03">Russia also broadcasted that the white</text>
  <text start="361.039" dur="6.451">helmets were preparing to push a false</text>
  <text start="364.58" dur="4.11">flag so it really wasn&amp;#39;t a coincidence</text>
  <text start="367.49" dur="2.549">this was completely planned and when</text>
  <text start="368.69" dur="3.27">they heard troops coming out of Syria</text>
  <text start="370.039" dur="3.93">they realized they needed to do</text>
  <text start="371.96" dur="4.949">something to keep the troops there and</text>
  <text start="373.969" dur="6.621">to continue the war in Syria and maybe</text>
  <text start="376.909" dur="7.491">even escalate it well during this time</text>
  <text start="380.59" dur="8.259">the paid mercenaries the terrorists in</text>
  <text start="384.4" dur="9.04">Syria they were instructed to launch an</text>
  <text start="388.849" dur="8.581">all-out offensive in Syria once the</text>
  <text start="393.44" dur="7.319">bombs started to drop so this was the</text>
  <text start="397.43" dur="7.28">plan have the false flag say it was</text>
  <text start="400.759" dur="6.84">Assad that he&amp;#39;s the one who caused the</text>
  <text start="404.71" dur="4.87">chemical attack that killed all these</text>
  <text start="407.599" dur="4.74">individuals which really didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="409.58" dur="6.149">the United States was going to launch a</text>
  <text start="412.339" dur="6">strike into Syria the targets were going</text>
  <text start="415.729" dur="5.22">to be picked by the deep state where</text>
  <text start="418.339" dur="5.151">they wanted them to go and they were</text>
  <text start="420.949" dur="8.43">going to mount a major major offensive</text>
  <text start="423.49" dur="8.32">to try to gain territory try to push the</text>
  <text start="429.379" dur="4.38">whole mission forward and maybe get rid</text>
  <text start="431.81" dur="4.77">of Assad all at the same time</text>
  <text start="433.759" dur="5.94">but the problem is Trump didn&amp;#39;t play</text>
  <text start="436.58" dur="6.03">along he talked about striking he called</text>
  <text start="439.699" dur="5.22">the son an animal and then he kind of</text>
  <text start="442.61" dur="4.559">backed off and there&amp;#39;s a reason why he</text>
  <text start="444.919" dur="4.201">did all this and we&amp;#39;ll talk about that</text>
  <text start="447.169" dur="4.92">in a minute but we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="449.12" dur="4.11">realize that other European countries</text>
  <text start="452.089" dur="3.991">are saying that we don&amp;#39;t want to get</text>
  <text start="453.23" dur="4.59">this Germany is saying listen we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="456.08" dur="3.6">want to start a war with Russia again</text>
  <text start="457.82" dur="3.98">Russia does supply a lot of their gas</text>
  <text start="459.68" dur="5.22">and they&amp;#39;re saying you know something</text>
  <text start="461.8" dur="7.15">we&amp;#39;re refusing to launch any type of</text>
  <text start="464.9" dur="7.2">strike at Russia or Syria at this time</text>
  <text start="468.95" dur="5.73">we also see Italy is saying the same</text>
  <text start="472.1" dur="4.7">thing yeah you know what we&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="474.68" dur="6.24">take part in any military action against</text>
  <text start="476.8" dur="6.22">President Assad Greece Cyprus they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="480.92" dur="4.68">saying the same exact thing none of</text>
  <text start="483.02" dur="5.49">these countries are joining in remember</text>
  <text start="485.6" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s the UK and France with McCrone</text>
  <text start="488.51" dur="4.62">Makran is saying that yeah we have</text>
  <text start="490.37" dur="4.71">irrefutable evidence that it was Assad</text>
  <text start="493.13" dur="5.4">well present the evidence then if you</text>
  <text start="495.08" dur="7.32">have it show the world your evidence and</text>
  <text start="498.53" dur="7.86">let us dissect it to see if it holds</text>
  <text start="502.4" dur="5.82">true now if you notice the UK they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="506.39" dur="3.78">having this whole problem with their</text>
  <text start="508.22" dur="3.39">scruple poisoning thing completely</text>
  <text start="510.17" dur="4.26">falling apart and it does make sense</text>
  <text start="511.61" dur="6.66">that they might have orchestrated this</text>
  <text start="514.43" dur="5.07">entire thing we see macron well he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="518.27" dur="3.959">doing many different things in his</text>
  <text start="519.5" dur="4.8">country and the people are not going</text>
  <text start="522.229" dur="4.681">along with it remember he is a Ross</text>
  <text start="524.3" dur="5.55">trial pick to run the country they put</text>
  <text start="526.91" dur="5.91">him into place and we see that he needs</text>
  <text start="529.85" dur="5.63">to boost his ratings right now and this</text>
  <text start="532.82" dur="6.09">is why he&amp;#39;s pushing this very very hard</text>
  <text start="535.48" dur="5.89">Sweden right now is preparing a new</text>
  <text start="538.91" dur="4.08">draft for the UN Security Council</text>
  <text start="541.37" dur="4.68">resolution on Syria</text>
  <text start="542.99" dur="5.16">they won a investigative mechanism and</text>
  <text start="546.05" dur="5.06">an international mission that will look</text>
  <text start="548.15" dur="6.6">into reports of chemical stockpiles in</text>
  <text start="551.11" dur="6.36">Syria to see who actually has the</text>
  <text start="554.75" dur="8.16">chemical stockpiles remember back in</text>
  <text start="557.47" dur="7.24">2013 2014 the OPCW went in and removed</text>
  <text start="562.91" dur="3.57">the chemical weapons United States</text>
  <text start="564.71" dur="4.2">signed off Russia signed off</text>
  <text start="566.48" dur="4.61">Surya signed off and there are supposed</text>
  <text start="568.91" dur="5.16">to be no chemical weapons in there and</text>
  <text start="571.09" dur="6.28">Sweden right now is saying we need to</text>
  <text start="574.07" dur="6.96">have an investigative body go into Syria</text>
  <text start="577.37" dur="6.15">and finally look at all this stuff of</text>
  <text start="581.03" dur="5.58">what is going on there now we see that</text>
  <text start="583.52" dur="5.79">the OPCW they are headed to</text>
  <text start="586.61" dur="4.44">Syria we see right now that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="589.31" dur="3.959">official they&amp;#39;ve granted them visas they</text>
  <text start="591.05" dur="5.279">granted four of them to four individuals</text>
  <text start="593.269" dur="6.901">of the OPCW to go into Duma and to</text>
  <text start="596.329" dur="5.581">inspect and Russia they are guarding the</text>
  <text start="600.17" dur="4.32">area making sure that no one tries to</text>
  <text start="601.91" dur="4.77">bomb it no one tampers with it so the</text>
  <text start="604.49" dur="5.51">OPCW can go in there and they can</text>
  <text start="606.68" dur="6.99">investigate what really happened now the</text>
  <text start="610" dur="7.45">OPCW they&amp;#39;re saying that we are not</text>
  <text start="613.67" dur="5.58">going to disclose details of its experts</text>
  <text start="617.45" dur="3.12">work in Syria for security reasons</text>
  <text start="619.25" dur="3.39">Russia Syria they&amp;#39;re going to protect</text>
  <text start="620.57" dur="4.199">the OPCW workers they&amp;#39;re going to make</text>
  <text start="622.64" dur="3.78">sure nothing happens to them and they</text>
  <text start="624.769" dur="4.471">went on to say that we are unable to</text>
  <text start="626.42" dur="4.349">share operational details this policy</text>
  <text start="629.24" dur="3.81">exists to preserve the integrity of the</text>
  <text start="630.769" dur="5.19">investigator investigatory process and</text>
  <text start="633.05" dur="5.4">its results as well as to ensure the</text>
  <text start="635.959" dur="4.801">safety and security of the OPCW experts</text>
  <text start="638.45" dur="4.29">and personnel involved the policy</text>
  <text start="640.76" dur="3.99">applies to dates of the experts arrival</text>
  <text start="642.74" dur="4.44">departure their numbers routes and</text>
  <text start="644.75" dur="4.529">actions all parties are asked to respect</text>
  <text start="647.18" dur="4.339">the confidentiality parameters required</text>
  <text start="649.279" dur="4.861">for a rigorous and unimpeded</text>
  <text start="651.519" dur="6.43">investigation now they&amp;#39;re doing this on</text>
  <text start="654.14" dur="7.02">purpose so countries or individuals in</text>
  <text start="657.949" dur="5.041">the UN don&amp;#39;t come out and say we have</text>
  <text start="661.16" dur="4.5">the information it&amp;#39;s definitely Assad</text>
  <text start="662.99" dur="5.61">they want everything under tight</text>
  <text start="665.66" dur="6">security so no country comes out and</text>
  <text start="668.6" dur="6.03">starts saying that this is true that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="671.66" dur="5.64">not true and going on they want everyone</text>
  <text start="674.63" dur="5.73">to wait for the final report now the</text>
  <text start="677.3" dur="5.01">Pentagon they&amp;#39;re saying that yeah we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="680.36" dur="4.5">assessing the intelligence we need to</text>
  <text start="682.31" dur="5.279">prove that Assad conducted the chemical</text>
  <text start="684.86" dur="6.99">attacks and at this time we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="687.589" dur="6.481">any evidence whatsoever that Assad did</text>
  <text start="691.85" dur="4.799">anything we&amp;#39;re relying on social media</text>
  <text start="694.07" dur="5.28">so basically the United States</text>
  <text start="696.649" dur="6.06">government is relying on social media</text>
  <text start="699.35" dur="6.69">for their intelligence that doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="702.709" dur="4.411">any we need to get real evidence we need</text>
  <text start="706.04" dur="3.6">people on the ground</text>
  <text start="707.12" dur="5.76">we need soil samples we need to talk to</text>
  <text start="709.64" dur="5.009">people we need the link between the</text>
  <text start="712.88" dur="4.319">chemical attack and whoever did it if</text>
  <text start="714.649" dur="5.701">there was even a chemical attack so we</text>
  <text start="717.199" dur="5.161">see right now that madis is saying</text>
  <text start="720.35" dur="3.66">there is no evidence whatsoever they</text>
  <text start="722.36" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t have any evidence of chlorine or</text>
  <text start="724.01" dur="4.38">sarin or anything else and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="726.17" dur="5.34">nothing there at this point so this is</text>
  <text start="728.39" dur="4.92">why we have the OPCW going in there</text>
  <text start="731.51" dur="3.39">Russia has already looked at the area</text>
  <text start="733.31" dur="3.99">they already spoken to a few people and</text>
  <text start="734.9" dur="4.32">everyone seems a little confused because</text>
  <text start="737.3" dur="3.9">the doctors and the hospitals they</text>
  <text start="739.22" dur="4.38">haven&amp;#39;t treated anyone they haven&amp;#39;t seen</text>
  <text start="741.2" dur="6.45">any dead bodies they haven&amp;#39;t seen any</text>
  <text start="743.6" dur="7.62">signs of chemical substances so things</text>
  <text start="747.65" dur="7.05">are a little strange in Syria which once</text>
  <text start="751.22" dur="6.21">again tells us that there&amp;#39;s no way the</text>
  <text start="754.7" dur="4.5">United States the UK France knows</text>
  <text start="757.43" dur="3.9">anything because they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="759.2" dur="4.5">investigators on the ground so how do</text>
  <text start="761.33" dur="5.94">they know this that it&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="763.7" dur="7.14">Russia and Syria we see there&amp;#39;s a second</text>
  <text start="767.27" dur="6.09">US tomahawk capable destroyer entering</text>
  <text start="770.84" dur="4.98">the Mediterranean it is the USS Winston</text>
  <text start="773.36" dur="5.39">Churchill and they&amp;#39;re saying that this</text>
  <text start="775.82" dur="5.94">was launched April 5th for a routine</text>
  <text start="778.75" dur="5.23">deployment for different drills in the</text>
  <text start="781.76" dur="6.45">Mediterranean and once again I believe</text>
  <text start="783.98" dur="7.17">that all of this is being set up for a</text>
  <text start="788.21" dur="6.09">specific reason and I don&amp;#39;t believe the</text>
  <text start="791.15" dur="5.76">reason is to go to World War 3 or to</text>
  <text start="794.3" dur="4.92">have war with Russia to remove Assad I</text>
  <text start="796.91" dur="4.17">believe this is a completely different</text>
  <text start="799.22" dur="4.41">strategy which we&amp;#39;re gonna discuss in</text>
  <text start="801.08" dur="6.63">just a moment but we need to remember</text>
  <text start="803.63" dur="6.78">that the Truman Strike Group that is</text>
  <text start="807.71" dur="5.49">headed towards Syria is gonna take six</text>
  <text start="810.41" dur="4.86">to seven days approximately to cross the</text>
  <text start="813.2" dur="4.86">Atlantic at 30 knots I mean they can</text>
  <text start="815.27" dur="4.47">bump this up but that&amp;#39;s on average and</text>
  <text start="818.06" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s gonna take another three to four</text>
  <text start="819.74" dur="4.47">days to basically go through the</text>
  <text start="822.26" dur="5.07">Mediterranean and arrive at Syria</text>
  <text start="824.21" dur="6.78">so this buys Trump some time and those</text>
  <text start="827.33" dur="6.6">people working with him some time to let</text>
  <text start="830.99" dur="5.85">the investigators do their job and to</text>
  <text start="833.93" dur="4.65">hold everyone off while Trump plays with</text>
  <text start="836.84" dur="4.14">the corporate media with the deep state</text>
  <text start="838.58" dur="5.07">saying that he&amp;#39;s going to strike now he</text>
  <text start="840.98" dur="3.29">did tweet and why did he make this</text>
  <text start="843.65" dur="3.81">statement</text>
  <text start="844.27" dur="5.65">he never said when an attack on Syria</text>
  <text start="847.46" dur="6.36">would take place could be very soon or</text>
  <text start="849.92" dur="7.32">not soon at all so he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="853.82" dur="6.21">that he there could be an attack or</text>
  <text start="857.24" dur="5.07">maybe no attacks at all now let&amp;#39;s think</text>
  <text start="860.03" dur="3.75">about this for a second we discussed the</text>
  <text start="862.31" dur="4.32">strategy before but let&amp;#39;s take this a</text>
  <text start="863.78" dur="6.36">little bit further now let&amp;#39;s say Trump</text>
  <text start="866.63" dur="5.64">decides to strike Siri what would be the</text>
  <text start="870.14" dur="4.32">benefit of the strike Syria has</text>
  <text start="872.27" dur="4.47">allegedly moved all assets to Russian</text>
  <text start="874.46" dur="4.41">bases so most of these air bases and</text>
  <text start="876.74" dur="4.23">stuff they&amp;#39;re probably empty just like</text>
  <text start="878.87" dur="4.8">the last time he fired the Tomahawk</text>
  <text start="880.97" dur="4.98">missiles Russia electronically jammed a</text>
  <text start="883.67" dur="4.14">lot of them shot them down and it really</text>
  <text start="885.95" dur="4.2">did no damage to the airbase it was</text>
  <text start="887.81" dur="4.35">evacuated and it was open up an hour</text>
  <text start="890.15" dur="4.2">later and planes were taken off of</text>
  <text start="892.16" dur="4.95">course they came out and they said back</text>
  <text start="894.35" dur="5.67">then that we got the chemical stockpiles</text>
  <text start="897.11" dur="5.7">and we stopped Assad from using the</text>
  <text start="900.02" dur="6.27">chemical weapon once again which was not</text>
  <text start="902.81" dur="5.34">true at all so if we strike these air</text>
  <text start="906.29" dur="4.44">bases they&amp;#39;re empty are they going to</text>
  <text start="908.15" dur="4.68">use the same argument once again because</text>
  <text start="910.73" dur="3.63">the argument didn&amp;#39;t work the last time</text>
  <text start="912.83" dur="3.87">because what they&amp;#39;re saying and if we</text>
  <text start="914.36" dur="5.28">believe their story Assad used chemical</text>
  <text start="916.7" dur="6">weapons again so the strike really adds</text>
  <text start="919.64" dur="4.92">no benefit attacking a Russian base well</text>
  <text start="922.7" dur="3.78">that would be a complete disaster that</text>
  <text start="924.56" dur="4.68">would kick off world war 3 because now</text>
  <text start="926.48" dur="4.8">you&amp;#39;re bringing Russia into this plus if</text>
  <text start="929.24" dur="5.76">you&amp;#39;re attacking the Syrian army or the</text>
  <text start="931.28" dur="6">Russian forces again that&amp;#39;s world war 3</text>
  <text start="935" dur="4.11">and most likely an impeachment for Trump</text>
  <text start="937.28" dur="4.41">without getting congressional approval</text>
  <text start="939.11" dur="4.53">so what would be the benefit of all this</text>
  <text start="941.69" dur="4.17">Trump will go down as being the</text>
  <text start="943.64" dur="4.77">president that started World War 3 maybe</text>
  <text start="945.86" dur="4.53">move into a nuclear war what would be</text>
  <text start="948.41" dur="4.29">the benefit there is no benefit to any</text>
  <text start="950.39" dur="5.37">of this it makes no sense whatsoever</text>
  <text start="952.7" dur="4.62">plus we need to understand that more and</text>
  <text start="955.76" dur="4.35">more military assets are being brought</text>
  <text start="957.32" dur="5.64">into Syria the whole entire country is</text>
  <text start="960.11" dur="5.34">blanketed with the s-300s 400 missile</text>
  <text start="962.96" dur="5.4">system the electronic jamming and most</text>
  <text start="965.45" dur="5.07">likely they pre-programmed everything to</text>
  <text start="968.36" dur="5.55">basically go after anything that enters</text>
  <text start="970.52" dur="5.58">the airspace so once again this whole</text>
  <text start="973.91" dur="4.11">area is completely protected now maybe</text>
  <text start="976.1" dur="5.85">people are saying well we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="978.02" dur="6.69">strike the area where the false flag</text>
  <text start="981.95" dur="4.14">occurred well if you were going to do</text>
  <text start="984.71" dur="2.88">that you probably should have done that</text>
  <text start="986.09" dur="3.39">a long time ago but</text>
  <text start="987.59" dur="3.24">now Russia has already been there</text>
  <text start="989.48" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;ve taken pictures they&amp;#39;ve taken</text>
  <text start="990.83" dur="6.47">samples the OPCW they&amp;#39;re on their way</text>
  <text start="993.38" dur="8.13">and Russia has already secured the area</text>
  <text start="997.3" dur="7.6">so that makes no sense either so what is</text>
  <text start="1001.51" dur="7.65">Trump planning to do here it seems like</text>
  <text start="1004.9" dur="6.6">he&amp;#39;s waiting for evidence evidence from</text>
  <text start="1009.16" dur="4.23">the OPCW now why didn&amp;#39;t he just agree</text>
  <text start="1011.5" dur="3.69">with Russia that would have been easy Oh</text>
  <text start="1013.39" dur="3.81">Russia&amp;#39;s right it is a false flag we</text>
  <text start="1015.19" dur="3.96">have the information because then the</text>
  <text start="1017.2" dur="3.72">corporate media would go and say hey see</text>
  <text start="1019.15" dur="2.19">he&amp;#39;s working with Russia he agrees with</text>
  <text start="1020.92" dur="2.55">them</text>
  <text start="1021.34" dur="4.26">he&amp;#39;s working with Putin that&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1023.47" dur="3.57">staying away from that so he&amp;#39;s waiting</text>
  <text start="1025.6" dur="4.68">for an independent body</text>
  <text start="1027.04" dur="7.5">the OPCW he knew that Russia would veto</text>
  <text start="1030.28" dur="7.17">the UN draft and Putin and Trump already</text>
  <text start="1034.54" dur="6.08">discussed this that the OPCW would go</text>
  <text start="1037.45" dur="6.75">into Syria and do a real investigation</text>
  <text start="1040.62" dur="6.85">under a security umbrella so no</text>
  <text start="1044.2" dur="6.99">information gets out and maybe the OPCW</text>
  <text start="1047.47" dur="5.94">comes back with inconclusive evidence we</text>
  <text start="1051.19" dur="3.36">can&amp;#39;t make heads or tail we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1053.41" dur="3.78">if it&amp;#39;s Assad we don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1054.55" dur="4.53">rebels we have no clue well Trump is off</text>
  <text start="1057.19" dur="3.69">the hook there might be no evidence of a</text>
  <text start="1059.08" dur="5.76">chemical attack at all where they say</text>
  <text start="1060.88" dur="6.12">this was staged we have no evidence of</text>
  <text start="1064.84" dur="6.06">any chemicals there are no bodies there</text>
  <text start="1067" dur="5.52">is absolutely nothing or they can say it</text>
  <text start="1070.9" dur="3.99">was the terrorists it was the paid</text>
  <text start="1072.52" dur="5.1">mercenaries they&amp;#39;re the ones who created</text>
  <text start="1074.89" dur="4.89">this staged event this false flag they</text>
  <text start="1077.62" dur="4.92">used chemicals and they killed all these</text>
  <text start="1079.78" dur="5.07">or the other one is this was a staged</text>
  <text start="1082.54" dur="6.27">event by the white helmet all of this</text>
  <text start="1084.85" dur="7.08">gives Trump an exit plan what does this</text>
  <text start="1088.81" dur="5.25">mean well the USS Truman Strike Group</text>
  <text start="1091.93" dur="4.14">will be there around April 22nd maybe</text>
  <text start="1094.06" dur="3.51">the beginning of May all depends on the</text>
  <text start="1096.07" dur="2.67">weather and everything else and how fast</text>
  <text start="1097.57" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re going let&amp;#39;s say they get there</text>
  <text start="1098.74" dur="5.16">by April 22nd or around that time now we</text>
  <text start="1101.62" dur="4.38">need to go to what James Madison today</text>
  <text start="1103.9" dur="4.2">because this is very important he was</text>
  <text start="1106" dur="4.41">asked a question whether there is</text>
  <text start="1108.1" dur="4.86">sufficient evidence to accuse the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1110.41" dur="6.3">government of using chemical agents in</text>
  <text start="1112.96" dur="6.72">Douma his response to this was the</text>
  <text start="1116.71" dur="4.38">following that the intelligence on the</text>
  <text start="1119.68" dur="4.379">alleged use of chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="1121.09" dur="6.959">since Terry in Syria in the Duma region</text>
  <text start="1124.059" dur="6.44">is still in progress to quote him were</text>
  <text start="1128.049" dur="5.46">still assessing the intelligence</text>
  <text start="1130.499" dur="4.961">ourselves and our outline we&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="1133.509" dur="4.92">working on that this is what he said</text>
  <text start="1135.46" dur="5.849">when they asked him the question so the</text>
  <text start="1138.429" dur="6.33">United States right now is not saying</text>
  <text start="1141.309" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s Assad they&amp;#39;re still working through</text>
  <text start="1144.759" dur="4.62">this and looking at the evidence and</text>
  <text start="1146.409" dur="4.531">we&amp;#39;ve reported just before that most of</text>
  <text start="1149.379" dur="5.4">the evidence is coming from social media</text>
  <text start="1150.94" dur="6.66">I think what Trump madis the Patriots</text>
  <text start="1154.779" dur="6.691">what they&amp;#39;re waiting for they&amp;#39;re waiting</text>
  <text start="1157.6" dur="7.769">for the report to show that Assad didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1161.47" dur="7.74">do this it was inconclusive or it was</text>
  <text start="1165.369" dur="7.26">the rebels this then will allow Trump to</text>
  <text start="1169.21" dur="5.52">say okay it wasn&amp;#39;t Assad you know</text>
  <text start="1172.629" dur="5.311">something I&amp;#39;m removing the troops</text>
  <text start="1174.73" dur="6.449">there&amp;#39;s no reason for our troops to be</text>
  <text start="1177.94" dur="6.3">there that information was fake phony</text>
  <text start="1181.179" dur="5.61">and false and it&amp;#39;s time to get rid of to</text>
  <text start="1184.24" dur="4.74">get the troops out of there now we need</text>
  <text start="1186.789" dur="5.911">to remember something very important</text>
  <text start="1188.98" dur="8.13">there were targets that were chosen in</text>
  <text start="1192.7" dur="8.309">Syria and it wasn&amp;#39;t to hit Assad it</text>
  <text start="1197.11" dur="6.86">wasn&amp;#39;t to hit Russia they were chosen</text>
  <text start="1201.009" dur="6.63">because they were the deep state targets</text>
  <text start="1203.97" dur="6.88">who will be who will the fleet be firing</text>
  <text start="1207.639" dur="8.191">at the paid mercenaries the deep state</text>
  <text start="1210.85" dur="8.399">army when Trump decides to withdraw the</text>
  <text start="1215.83" dur="6.539">troops from Syria the deep state is</text>
  <text start="1219.249" dur="5.64">going to resist because they need the</text>
  <text start="1222.369" dur="6.211">troops there because the troops protect</text>
  <text start="1224.889" dur="6.451">the Islamic state al Qaeda the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1228.58" dur="6.99">democratic forces the entire deep state</text>

  <text start="1235.57" dur="5.79">the country removed the deep state the</text>
  <text start="1238.72" dur="5.64">paid mercenaries most likely will try to</text>
  <text start="1241.36" dur="7.139">keep them there because Russia Syria and</text>
  <text start="1244.36" dur="6.87">Iran will not fire on all the bases that</text>
  <text start="1248.499" dur="5.701">they created if there are US troops</text>
  <text start="1251.23" dur="3.66">there which basically sets up a</text>
  <text start="1254.2" dur="3.84">roadblock</text>
  <text start="1254.89" dur="6.57">because they they will not get rid of</text>
  <text start="1258.04" dur="6.9">the rest of the terrorist groups if the</text>
  <text start="1261.46" dur="7.74">US soldiers are in place if trump</text>
  <text start="1264.94" dur="8.31">removes the US soldiers well it&amp;#39;s open</text>
  <text start="1269.2" dur="8.31">game on terrace Russia Syria and Iran</text>
  <text start="1273.25" dur="7.2">can go in and clean up this is what the</text>
  <text start="1277.51" dur="6.9">deep state is most nervous about this is</text>
  <text start="1280.45" dur="7.32">why they don&amp;#39;t want a report this is why</text>
  <text start="1284.41" dur="5.49">they want an attack now now they might</text>
  <text start="1287.77" dur="5.37">do something there might be another</text>
  <text start="1289.9" dur="8.04">false flag to get this war going because</text>
  <text start="1293.14" dur="7.8">as time goes by and the inspectors start</text>
  <text start="1297.94" dur="5.51">to collect evidence and figure things</text>
  <text start="1300.94" dur="5.58">out they&amp;#39;re gonna lose their edge and</text>
  <text start="1303.45" dur="5.859">this is a very big problem for them so</text>
  <text start="1306.52" dur="4.77">the ships are being brought in they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1309.309" dur="4.261">gonna have the troops withdrawn from</text>
  <text start="1311.29" dur="5.879">Syria the deep state is going to try to</text>
  <text start="1313.57" dur="5.609">keep them there most likely the United</text>
  <text start="1317.169" dur="4.321">States will fire missiles if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1319.179" dur="4.951">necessary because that&amp;#39;s why Trump said</text>

  <text start="1324.13" dur="5.97">firing on the the Islamic state al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="1327.04" dur="4.95">all the paid mercenary forces the ships</text>
  <text start="1330.1" dur="4.89">most likely most of them will stay there</text>
  <text start="1331.99" dur="6.51">because the next target is then Iran the</text>
  <text start="1334.99" dur="5.49">deep state the proxy forces are in Iran</text>
  <text start="1338.5" dur="3.78">and they&amp;#39;re gonna do the same thing that</text>
