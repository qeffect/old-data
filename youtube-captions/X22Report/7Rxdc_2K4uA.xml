  <text start="54.16" dur="5.31">to see if this all makes sense and use</text>
  <text start="56.71" dur="4.2">our common sense to say hey this doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="59.47" dur="5.64">seem right there is definitely something</text>
  <text start="60.91" dur="7.709">wrong in 2008 we saw the crash of the</text>

  <text start="197.28" dur="6.06">downgraded to me huge huge red flag</text>
  <text start="200.97" dur="5.489">right here that there is something wrong</text>
  <text start="203.34" dur="3.69">but you talk to most people and they</text>
  <text start="206.459" dur="2.611">don&amp;#39;t even know what you&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="207.03" dur="4.29">about that what we were downgraded I</text>
  <text start="209.07" dur="6.71">don&amp;#39;t even know what that means but you</text>
  <text start="211.32" dur="7.5">know that happened in 2011-2012 we had</text>
  <text start="215.78" dur="4.33">quantitative easing 3 to infinity where</text>
  <text start="218.82" dur="2.97">the fed announced that they were going</text>
  <text start="220.11" dur="4.05">to buy 40 billion in mortgage back</text>
  <text start="221.79" dur="5.85">investments each month until the economy</text>
  <text start="224.16" dur="7.169">approves and the employee be</text>
  <text start="227.64" dur="5.64">unemployment rate drops the the central</text>
  <text start="231.329" dur="4.41">bank continues to sell short-term bonds</text>
  <text start="233.28" dur="4.62">and use the money to buy long-term bonds</text>
  <text start="235.739" dur="4.201">and the Fed said they were going to keep</text>
  <text start="237.9" dur="5.58">the interest rates until about mid-2015</text>
  <text start="239.94" dur="8.04">and it&amp;#39;s funny because at the end of the</text>
  <text start="243.48" dur="6.72">year the in December they announced the</text>
  <text start="247.98" dur="3.45">beginning of January they were going to</text>
  <text start="250.2" dur="3.21">start which i&amp;#39;m going to call</text>
  <text start="251.43" dur="6.029">quantitative easing for and they were</text>
  <text start="253.41" dur="6.54">going to start buying 85 billion spent</text>
  <text start="257.459" dur="5.761">85 billion per month to buy the bonds</text>
  <text start="259.95" dur="5.37">and mortgage-backed securities and that</text>
  <text start="263.22" dur="4.86">really comes out to about a trillion a</text>
  <text start="265.32" dur="6.15">year that they&amp;#39;re using to prop up the</text>
  <text start="268.08" dur="6">economy k imagine if they just stop this</text>
  <text start="271.47" dur="3.36">i mean without all this money coming</text>
  <text start="274.08" dur="3.03">into the</text>
  <text start="274.83" dur="4.32">on me to the banks and buying these</text>
  <text start="277.11" dur="5.22">bonds because first of all who would buy</text>
  <text start="279.15" dur="6.69">these bonds I mean right now it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="282.33" dur="7.62">much the Fed there&amp;#39;s hardly anyone else</text>
  <text start="285.84" dur="8.61">purchasing the Treasury bonds now that</text>
  <text start="289.95" dur="6.27">brings us to 2013 now 2013 I mean we&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="304.08" dur="6.96">to right now I mean the first I mean a</text>
  <text start="307.38" dur="7.47">red flag to me is Germany wanted 674</text>
  <text start="311.04" dur="6.06">tons of gold back now to me when</text>

  <text start="338.43" dur="6.9">sense to me right now our debt is</text>
  <text start="341.55" dur="8.3">approaching 17 trillion dollars it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="345.33" dur="4.52">funny because when we had the sequester</text>

  <text start="395.07" dur="5.37">for most Americans you have to realize I</text>
  <text start="397.74" dur="5.91">mean if you really think about it and</text>

  <text start="406.53" dur="3.27">really getting harder to purchase</text>
  <text start="407.79" dur="5.46">we&amp;#39;ll think about it if we go back to</text>
  <text start="409.8" dur="5.01">the 70s where you can pick up a car for</text>
  <text start="413.25" dur="4.8">four or five thousand dollars it was</text>
  <text start="414.81" dur="5.97">really no financing back then you paid</text>
  <text start="418.05" dur="7.04">cash so your money was definitely worth</text>
  <text start="420.78" dur="7.26">more back then as we move into the 80s</text>
  <text start="425.09" dur="5.68">people couldn&amp;#39;t pay cash anymore so we</text>
  <text start="428.04" dur="5.75">turned to financing to make monthly</text>
  <text start="430.77" dur="6.89">payments over three to four years and</text>
  <text start="433.79" dur="6.07">when we got to late 80s Early 90s</text>
  <text start="437.66" dur="6.7">actually payments went to about five</text>
  <text start="439.86" dur="7.5">years and that was with financing when</text>
  <text start="444.36" dur="5.88">financing for automobiles got too</text>
  <text start="447.36" dur="4.44">expensive we started something else</text>

  <text start="985.29" dur="4.92">that the numbers continually go up</text>
  <text start="988.14" dur="4.26">compared to the United States and the</text>
  <text start="990.21" dur="6.57">other countries and they get they go up</text>
  <text start="992.4" dur="8.19">quite a bit so I mean that&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="996.78" dur="6.36">where I&amp;#39;m showing that where I&amp;#39;m seeing</text>
  <text start="1000.59" dur="5.4">and I&amp;#39;ve been tracking it from last year</text>
  <text start="1003.14" dur="4.83">and they are purchased I mean again this</text>
  <text start="1005.99" dur="5.34">is what&amp;#39;s shown there I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1007.97" dur="7.11">more but this is how you can you can see</text>
  <text start="1011.33" dur="7.14">what&amp;#39;s really going on recently in the</text>
  <text start="1015.08" dur="7.67">news united kingdom they were just</text>
  <text start="1018.47" dur="7.17">downgraded from triple-a to aa1 which</text>
  <text start="1022.75" dur="6.55">again when have we ever heard this</text>
  <text start="1025.64" dur="8.4">before not in my lifetime and I&amp;#39;m 47</text>
  <text start="1029.3" dur="7.2">I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve never heard of the United</text>
  <text start="1034.04" dur="5.76">States or the United Kingdom being</text>
  <text start="1036.5" dur="5.15">downgraded and i&amp;#39;m going to say since</text>
  <text start="1039.8" dur="7.23">we&amp;#39;re on the subject of downgrading I</text>
  <text start="1041.65" dur="10.41">find this very very interesting that the</text>
  <text start="1047.03" dur="8.82">United States is Susan suing SP and</text>
  <text start="1052.06" dur="6.78">stopping Egan Jones which they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1055.85" dur="6.87">banned for 18 months from raiding</text>
  <text start="1058.84" dur="6.97">anything because I&amp;#39;m telling you right</text>
  <text start="1062.72" dur="6.03">now the reason why the government did</text>
  <text start="1065.81" dur="4.71">this was to stop them from downgrading</text>
  <text start="1068.75" dur="4.73">the United States</text>
  <text start="1070.52" dur="5.49">personally it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter</text>
  <text start="1073.48" dur="5.68">downgrade I mean the first time we were</text>
  <text start="1076.01" dur="7.11">downgraded geithner they were like they</text>
  <text start="1079.16" dur="7.92">just they were angry so to stop at this</text>
  <text start="1083.12" dur="7.08">time basically they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re blaming</text>
  <text start="1087.08" dur="5.46">SP for the 2008 which were all the</text>
  <text start="1090.2" dur="6.57">credit rating agencies we r rating every</text>
  <text start="1092.54" dur="8.82">single of those acid those securities</text>
  <text start="1096.77" dur="8.49">triple-a with real estate but they</text>
  <text start="1101.36" dur="6.6">decided to sue SP either to make a of</text>
  <text start="1105.26" dur="5.73">them to stop the others but I&amp;#39;m telling</text>
  <text start="1107.96" dur="5.48">you right now there&amp;#39;s only one reason at</text>
  <text start="1110.99" dur="7.65">this point in time that you do this</text>
  <text start="1113.44" dur="9.46">because they were about to to to</text>
  <text start="1118.64" dur="6.74">downgrade talking about the rating</text>
  <text start="1122.9" dur="10.34">agencies let&amp;#39;s look at Moody&amp;#39;s right now</text>
  <text start="1125.38" dur="10.78">now Moody&amp;#39;s is very interesting Moody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1133.24" dur="6.3">Moody&amp;#39;s ratings often do not reflect its</text>
  <text start="1136.16" dur="5.76">analysis private conclusions I mean</text>
  <text start="1139.54" dur="6.07">these are some of the questions and</text>
  <text start="1141.92" dur="6.45">there disgaea forgot his name is coming</text>
  <text start="1145.61" dur="8.48">out and making accusations that Moody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1148.37" dur="9.36">is kind of you know not really rating</text>
  <text start="1154.09" dur="12.18">companies and and securities the way it</text>
  <text start="1157.73" dur="15.69">should I mean they&amp;#39;re rating securities</text>
  <text start="1166.27" dur="10.72">on the basis to make their clients happy</text>
  <text start="1173.42" dur="8.01">and not really rate what this security</text>
  <text start="1176.99" dur="9.54">should be rated and to me I think this</text>
  <text start="1181.43" dur="7.83">needs to be investigated and and which I</text>
  <text start="1186.53" dur="6.36">think they are doing right now but not</text>
  <text start="1189.26" dur="8.21">really in the news but this to me is a</text>
  <text start="1192.89" dur="8.7">red flag that something is going on and</text>
  <text start="1197.47" dur="6.85">you know something is not right</text>
