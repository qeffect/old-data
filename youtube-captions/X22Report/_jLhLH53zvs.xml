  <text start="185.59" dur="5.61">coalition of intelligence pertaining to</text>
  <text start="188.05" dur="7.26">Russia now this bill is being brought up</text>
  <text start="191.2" dur="6.72">because they want a way to stop what</text>
  <text start="195.31" dur="5.31">happened with the 2016 election where</text>
  <text start="197.92" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re saying that Russia came in and</text>
  <text start="200.62" dur="6.27">they hacked the election system and they</text>
  <text start="204.31" dur="5.19">made Donald Trump win now we can see</text>
  <text start="206.89" dur="5.31">right now shouldn&amp;#39;t we have proof first</text>
  <text start="209.5" dur="5.34">shouldn&amp;#39;t we have the evidence to show</text>
  <text start="212.2" dur="4.92">that this is exactly what happened</text>
  <text start="214.84" dur="4.41">before we start creating these bills</text>
  <text start="217.12" dur="4.23">before we start creating these centers</text>
  <text start="219.25" dur="4.56">but it looks like they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="221.35" dur="5.07">evidence they only care about pushing</text>
  <text start="223.81" dur="6.12">the propaganda and right now we have not</text>
  <text start="226.42" dur="6.569">seen any evidence of anything Russian</text>
  <text start="229.93" dur="5.13">collusion Russian hacking anything that</text>
  <text start="232.989" dur="5.191">they&amp;#39;d been talking about has all been</text>
  <text start="235.06" dur="5.25">propaganda if they had the evidence and</text>
  <text start="238.18" dur="3.75">the intelligent agencies had the</text>
  <text start="240.31" dur="3.929">evidence and I know they keep saying</text>
  <text start="241.93" dur="3.809">it&amp;#39;s classified you can&amp;#39;t see it but</text>
  <text start="244.239" dur="3.541">we&amp;#39;re telling you it&amp;#39;s true so you have</text>
  <text start="245.739" dur="3.84">to believe us if they truly had the</text>
  <text start="247.78" dur="4.25">evidence they would prove it to the</text>
  <text start="249.579" dur="5.641">American people they would show it and</text>
  <text start="252.03" dur="6.34">guess what they can&amp;#39;t that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="255.22" dur="5.069">hide behind everything about it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="258.37" dur="3.209">classified we can&amp;#39;t show you you just</text>
  <text start="260.289" dur="4.321">have to believe us well you know what</text>
  <text start="261.579" dur="6.391">we&amp;#39;re done believing in what you say we</text>
  <text start="264.61" dur="5.07">need proof and they can&amp;#39;t do it we see</text>
  <text start="267.97" dur="4.44">the US Congress is trying to find out</text>
  <text start="269.68" dur="5.549">whether a former operative of the US</text>
  <text start="272.41" dur="5.1">Central Intelligence Agency was engaged</text>
  <text start="275.229" dur="5.341">in the Montenegro failed coup attempt</text>
  <text start="277.51" dur="6.65">that took place on October 2016 2016 and</text>
  <text start="280.57" dur="7.17">we can see that right now we know that</text>
  <text start="284.16" dur="5.14">the CIA the intelligence organizations</text>
  <text start="287.74" dur="4.44">they go into each one of these countries</text>
  <text start="289.3" dur="4.32">and they have regime change now right</text>
  <text start="292.18" dur="3.69">before this happened where they were</text>
  <text start="293.62" dur="3.6">saying that Russia plotted the coup</text>
  <text start="295.87" dur="5.34">attempt and they were blaming it all on</text>
  <text start="297.22" dur="7.83">Russia very interestingly former CIA</text>
  <text start="301.21" dur="7.679">officer Joseph Assad visited Montenegro</text>
  <text start="305.05" dur="6.42">a few days prior to the failed coup</text>
  <text start="308.889" dur="4.65">attempt and of course right away they</text>
  <text start="311.47" dur="3.72">blamed it on Russia now if it was</text>
  <text start="313.539" dur="4.021">successful they would say it was a</text>
  <text start="315.19" dur="3.499">natural uprising people didn&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="317.56" dur="3.079">leader and this</text>
  <text start="318.689" dur="3.96">why we had regime change but since it</text>
  <text start="320.639" dur="4.89">failed they had to switch it around but</text>
  <text start="322.649" dur="6.41">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that this CIA</text>
  <text start="325.529" dur="6.51">officer was there a few days before</text>
  <text start="329.059" dur="6.64">everything happened and of course as we</text>
  <text start="332.039" dur="6.54">know the CIA the other intelligence</text>
  <text start="335.699" dur="5.7">agencies they are always involved and</text>
  <text start="338.579" dur="4.86">I&amp;#39;m saying mi6 Mossad and many other</text>
  <text start="341.399" dur="5.04">intelligence agencies they&amp;#39;re always</text>
  <text start="343.439" dur="4.65">working together group together working</text>
  <text start="346.439" dur="5.15">to have regime change in many of these</text>
  <text start="348.089" dur="5.43">countries we see out in Iraq the Iraqi</text>
  <text start="351.589" dur="5.35">government forces have regained control</text>
  <text start="353.519" dur="7.2">of the out while lead checkpoint on the</text>
  <text start="356.939" dur="6.39">border with Syria and this checkpoint is</text>
  <text start="360.719" dur="5.19">located near the Syrian border crossing</text>
  <text start="363.329" dur="4.8">the alt half which serves as a base for</text>
  <text start="365.909" dur="4.41">us back opposition militants this is</text>
  <text start="368.129" dur="5.1">where they bring in everything right</text>
  <text start="370.319" dur="6.541">near Jordan also and they call it the</text>
  <text start="373.229" dur="5.37">Syrian Iraqi Jordanian triangle and we</text>
  <text start="376.86" dur="4.859">can see right now the deep state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="378.599" dur="7.23">trying to maintain control there Iraq</text>
  <text start="381.719" dur="6.48">Syria Russia basically they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="385.829" dur="4.95">take control of their border now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="388.199" dur="4.53">very interesting Iraq wants to take</text>
  <text start="390.779" dur="3.99">control of the border Syria wants to</text>
  <text start="392.729" dur="5.4">take control of their border but the</text>
  <text start="394.769" dur="6.63">deep state is they&amp;#39;re trying to maintain</text>
  <text start="398.129" dur="6.45">control of those two countries borders</text>
  <text start="401.399" dur="6.03">the question is why is the United States</text>
  <text start="404.579" dur="4.26">the deep state even there I mean if</text>
  <text start="407.429" dur="3.871">these two countries are trying to</text>
  <text start="408.839" dur="4.65">control their border and take it away</text>
  <text start="411.3" dur="4.229">from the United States why is the United</text>
  <text start="413.489" dur="4.08">States fighting them because their</text>
  <text start="415.529" dur="4.68">objective is not to get the Islamic</text>
  <text start="417.569" dur="4.53">state their objective is not to have</text>
  <text start="420.209" dur="4.92">peace in the region their objective is</text>
  <text start="422.099" dur="5.761">to get Syria is to get Assad and they</text>
  <text start="425.129" dur="4.47">have not stopped we see the Russian</text>
  <text start="427.86" dur="3.149">Defense Ministry they&amp;#39;re saying they</text>
  <text start="429.599" dur="3.87">have eliminated one hundred and eighty</text>
  <text start="431.009" dur="6.541">terrorists they stopped the attacks and</text>
  <text start="433.469" dur="6.12">dare Azure and warplanes well they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="437.55" dur="3.899">been hitting a lot of the terrorists</text>
  <text start="439.589" dur="3.961">pushing them back and we see right now</text>
  <text start="441.449" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re going after the last remaining</text>
  <text start="443.55" dur="5.429">oil convoys and they&amp;#39;re hunting them</text>
  <text start="446.639" dur="3.96">down they are destroying them and we can</text>
  <text start="448.979" dur="3.33">see that it&amp;#39;s only a matter of time</text>
  <text start="450.599" dur="4.8">before</text>
  <text start="452.309" dur="5.25">the entire terrorist group the Islamic</text>
  <text start="455.399" dur="5.04">state completely Falls in Iraq and Syria</text>
  <text start="457.559" dur="4.8">and the whole thing is completely</text>
  <text start="460.439" dur="4.56">falling apart and this is why the deep</text>
  <text start="462.359" dur="5.58">state the elite this is why they only</text>
  <text start="464.999" dur="5.13">have a few options left think about what</text>
  <text start="467.939" dur="5.55">they have left here one create this</text>
  <text start="470.129" dur="7.38">incredible event that masks everything</text>
  <text start="473.489" dur="6.75">and brings us into a war or assassinate</text>
  <text start="477.509" dur="5.7">Trump and put in a puppet leader have a</text>
  <text start="480.239" dur="5.07">coup in the United States and put in a</text>
  <text start="483.209" dur="4.47">different leader that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="485.309" dur="4.89">trying to do right now so they only have</text>
  <text start="487.679" dur="4.71">a few options left and if they try to</text>
  <text start="490.199" dur="4.5">push these options it doesn&amp;#39;t end well</text>
  <text start="492.389" dur="4.77">for the people yes it works out great</text>
  <text start="494.699" dur="4.68">for them but we have to see because we</text>
  <text start="497.159" dur="5.22">have two sides fighting each other right</text>
  <text start="499.379" dur="5.82">now they&amp;#39;re battling and battling it out</text>
  <text start="502.379" dur="4.92">right now and they&amp;#39;re trying to gain</text>
  <text start="505.199" dur="4.68">hold of the entire system</text>
  <text start="507.299" dur="4.98">now as the Islamic state is continually</text>
  <text start="509.879" dur="5.54">being destroyed by Russia Syria and Iran</text>
  <text start="512.279" dur="6.03">we see that the Islamic state they are</text>
  <text start="515.419" dur="4.09">assassinating key individuals within the</text>
  <text start="518.309" dur="4.051">organization and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="519.509" dur="5.991">these are paid mercenaries this wasn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="522.36" dur="5.76">natural uprising these are paid Mehra&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="525.5" dur="6.639">mercenaries terrorists that the United</text>
  <text start="528.12" dur="7.259">States is real UK and the coalition</text>
  <text start="532.139" dur="5.49">forces created they fund them they</text>
  <text start="535.379" dur="3.871">support them and now we can see in</text>
  <text start="537.629" dur="3.091">certain areas where things are really</text>
  <text start="539.25" dur="4.019">falling apart that getting rid of</text>
  <text start="540.72" dur="4.71">certain individuals that might squeal</text>
  <text start="543.269" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s basically a mop-up operation right</text>
  <text start="545.43" dur="6.12">now we see the BRICS countries Brazil</text>
  <text start="548.699" dur="4.051">Russia India China South Africa they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="551.55" dur="3.149">going to be discussing efforts to</text>
  <text start="552.75" dur="3.779">resolve international conflicts in the</text>
  <text start="554.699" dur="5.58">Middle East and they&amp;#39;re meeting in</text>
  <text start="556.529" dur="5.67">Beijing on June 19th and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="560.279" dur="4.28">see what comes out of that but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="562.199" dur="6.211">very interesting is that Europe whole is</text>
  <text start="564.559" dur="6.88">warning about the Islamic state saying</text>
  <text start="568.41" dur="5.789">that they are ready to carry out attacks</text>
  <text start="571.439" dur="5.82">in the West they have no shortage of</text>
  <text start="574.199" dur="4.801">volunteers and basically this is a scare</text>
  <text start="577.259" dur="4.26">tactic and what they&amp;#39;re trying to do and</text>
  <text start="579" dur="4.679">this might lead into the main event now</text>
  <text start="581.519" dur="4.76">if you listen to all a demagogue which I</text>
  <text start="583.679" dur="6.32">did the spotlight interview with</text>
  <text start="586.279" dur="6.54">he breaks it down on how these false</text>
  <text start="589.999" dur="4.561">flags are carried out he looks at very</text>
  <text start="592.819" dur="4.471">specific things have been researching it</text>
  <text start="594.56" dur="5.579">for a very long time and you can see how</text>
  <text start="597.29" dur="5.64">most of these false flags are hoaxes and</text>
  <text start="600.139" dur="6.481">you can see how they are carried out and</text>
  <text start="602.93" dur="7.079">he really breaks it down and shows you</text>
  <text start="606.62" dur="6.469">how it is done and he is even able to</text>
  <text start="610.009" dur="5.64">predict some of them from past events</text>
  <text start="613.089" dur="6.011">but we can see right now that this is a</text>
  <text start="615.649" dur="5.37">scare tactic and this is their</text>
  <text start="619.1" dur="3.539">last-ditch effort because their</text>
  <text start="621.019" dur="3.901">last-ditch effort is not going to be a</text>
  <text start="622.639" dur="5.07">small event of a little gun shooting or</text>
  <text start="624.92" dur="4.62">a small event of a bomb going off or a</text>
  <text start="627.709" dur="5.281">flashbang type of thing to make it look</text>
  <text start="629.54" dur="5.88">like a bomb their last attempt is going</text>
  <text start="632.99" dur="4.8">to be huge almost like the World Trade</text>
  <text start="635.42" dur="3.479">Center type of an attempt and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="637.79" dur="3.599">going to have to do this in multiple</text>
  <text start="638.899" dur="4.38">locations and this will be the biggest</text>
  <text start="641.389" dur="3.93">event that they&amp;#39;ve ever pulled off and</text>
  <text start="643.279" dur="3.87">remember this is not coming from the</text>
  <text start="645.319" dur="5.281">Islamic state this is coming from the</text>
  <text start="647.149" dur="5.79">inside workings of different governments</text>
  <text start="650.6" dur="5.58">and different organization different</text>
  <text start="652.939" dur="6.15">intelligence agencies all coordinating</text>
  <text start="656.18" dur="6.18">with each other to create these things</text>
