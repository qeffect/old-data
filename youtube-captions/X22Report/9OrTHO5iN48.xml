  <text start="117.73" dur="4.83">collapse financial news now the US</text>
  <text start="120.46" dur="5.1">government the central bankers the Fed</text>
  <text start="122.56" dur="6.179">are continually manipulating all the</text>
  <text start="125.56" dur="4.949">numbers and we can see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="128.739" dur="4.651">manipulating GDP they revised the</text>
  <text start="130.509" dur="5.101">numbers they add Obamacare into their</text>
  <text start="133.39" dur="5.099">they readjust the inventories of</text>
  <text start="135.61" dur="4.47">supplies the unemployment numbers they</text>
  <text start="138.489" dur="5.941">don&amp;#39;t count those people who dropped off</text>
  <text start="140.08" dur="6.57">and then we have wages and we see wages</text>
  <text start="144.43" dur="4.169">are continually dropping and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="146.65" dur="7.11">saying it&amp;#39;s not that bad it&amp;#39;s dropping a</text>
  <text start="148.599" dur="7.801">little bit but it&amp;#39;s sustainable and when</text>
  <text start="153.76" dur="5.22">we look closer at how they&amp;#39;re keeping</text>
  <text start="156.4" dur="5.22">the wages up we see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="158.98" dur="4.75">continually paying the federal workers</text>
  <text start="161.62" dur="4.66">more and more money to</text>
  <text start="163.73" dur="5.28">set the private sector where those wages</text>
  <text start="166.28" dur="4.98">are coming down and there was a study</text>
  <text start="169.01" dur="5.58">that was done in 2014 where federal</text>
  <text start="171.26" dur="7.259">workers have earned more than seventy</text>
  <text start="174.59" dur="6.42">eight percent more on average than the</text>
  <text start="178.519" dur="4.891">private sector worker the federal</text>
  <text start="181.01" dur="4.47">workers earn forty-three percent more</text>
  <text start="183.41" dur="4.68">than the state and local government</text>
  <text start="185.48" dur="5.729">workers so to break this down in actual</text>
  <text start="188.09" dur="7.14">pay the average federal worker receives</text>
  <text start="191.209" dur="7.11">around 84,000 and change compared to</text>
  <text start="195.23" dur="4.92">only 56,000 and change for the hundred</text>
  <text start="198.319" dur="4.29">and eleven million American workers in</text>
  <text start="200.15" dur="4.559">the private sector now of course when</text>
  <text start="202.609" dur="4.261">you add the benefits the gap widens even</text>
  <text start="204.709" dur="5.691">more so what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="206.87" dur="7.08">continually giving the federal employees</text>
  <text start="210.4" dur="7.149">raises continually pushing their</text>
  <text start="213.95" dur="6.75">salaries up and what&amp;#39;s happening in the</text>
  <text start="217.549" dur="4.381">private sector people are not giving the</text>
  <text start="220.7" dur="3.899">companies are not giving the</text>
  <text start="221.93" dur="6.809">cost-of-living raises a lot of them are</text>
  <text start="224.599" dur="7.351">on a freeze where they&amp;#39;re not giving any</text>
  <text start="228.739" dur="5.34">type of raise whatsoever and wages are</text>
  <text start="231.95" dur="5.789">continually dropping and this is just</text>
  <text start="234.079" dur="5.821">another way of manipulating the data now</text>
  <text start="237.739" dur="3.991">with everything else that&amp;#39;s going on in</text>
  <text start="239.9" dur="5.13">the economy they&amp;#39;re continually pushing</text>
  <text start="241.73" dur="5.189">the idea that this economy is going very</text>
  <text start="245.03" dur="5.13">very well just take a look at the stock</text>
  <text start="246.919" dur="4.621">market yes it is down today the</text>
  <text start="250.16" dur="2.909">high-frequency trading the plunge</text>
  <text start="251.54" dur="3.539">protection team they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="253.069" dur="3.751">this up the best they can but when we</text>
  <text start="255.079" dur="3.96">look closely at what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="256.82" dur="5.159">here we see that things are really</text>
  <text start="259.039" dur="5.521">starting to fall apart now and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.979" dur="4.771">getting very hard to explain away why it</text>
  <text start="264.56" dur="4.35">is right now we know that home builder</text>
  <text start="266.75" dur="4.5">confidence there sentiment is way way up</text>
  <text start="268.91" dur="4.29">there believing that things are going to</text>
  <text start="271.25" dur="3.21">be getting better housing is going to</text>
  <text start="273.2" dur="5.16">improve they&amp;#39;re going to be making more</text>
  <text start="274.46" dur="7.29">sales and then we have reality we see</text>
  <text start="278.36" dur="5.07">that new home sales have now collapsed</text>
  <text start="281.75" dur="4.71">by eleven point five percent in</text>
  <text start="283.43" dur="7.41">September this is the largest month a</text>
  <text start="286.46" dur="5.67">month drop since july of 2013 and we can</text>
  <text start="290.84" dur="4.319">see right now they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="292.13" dur="5.219">revising the numbers trying to explain</text>
  <text start="295.159" dur="2.501">why explain away why all this is</text>
  <text start="297.349" dur="5.861">happening</text>
  <text start="297.66" dur="8.76">and what&amp;#39;s happening is number one the</text>
  <text start="303.21" dur="4.56">American people are tapped out they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="306.42" dur="4.53">not taking out the mortgages</text>
  <text start="307.77" dur="5.85">applications are declining existing home</text>

  <text start="328.23" dur="4.14">not really seen such great sales and</text>
  <text start="330.81" dur="5.97">when I looked around the country today I</text>
  <text start="332.37" dur="5.97">see homes in many areas now the prices</text>
  <text start="336.78" dur="3.81">are continually dropping people are</text>
  <text start="338.34" dur="5.37">having a very rough time trying to sell</text>

  <text start="939.4" dur="4.53">going to happen at this point in time I</text>
  <text start="940.93" dur="5.67">think Iran is now leaning towards China</text>
  <text start="943.93" dur="4.26">leaning towards Russia and they might</text>
  <text start="946.6" dur="2.73">start out selling the oil using the</text>

  <text start="976.269" dur="8.581">Israel and they&amp;#39;re clashing right now</text>
  <text start="978.97" dur="9.479">and we can see as we go further down the</text>
  <text start="984.85" dur="4.83">line in time we see that this situation</text>
  <text start="988.449" dur="5.19">is not going to get any better because</text>
  <text start="989.68" dur="8.279">the what&amp;#39;s happening in Syria is falling</text>
  <text start="993.639" dur="7.651">apart the petro dollar is under threat</text>

  <text start="1010.199" dur="4.861">dollars in our reserves we don&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="1013.889" dur="3.601">don&amp;#39;t need them to buy all that oil</text>
  <text start="1015.06" dur="4.29">anymore we can use other colored</text>
  <text start="1017.49" dur="5.399">currencies we can use gold silver and</text>
  <text start="1019.35" dur="4.92">when we do see this happen all of that</text>
  <text start="1022.889" dur="3.601">will flow back to the United States</text>
  <text start="1024.27" dur="4.769">which means the value of the dollar</text>
  <text start="1026.49" dur="4.98">decreases which means we see</text>

  <text start="1051.299" dur="4.951">of the different products because what</text>
  <text start="1053.94" dur="3.479">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re shrinking the</text>
  <text start="1056.25" dur="3.24">products they&amp;#39;re using different</text>
  <text start="1057.419" dur="5.041">ingredients in the products to keep the</text>
  <text start="1059.49" dur="4.95">prices level but if you shrink a product</text>
  <text start="1062.46" dur="5.099">you&amp;#39;re really seeing inflation because</text>
  <text start="1064.44" dur="4.64">it really costs more to buy that product</text>
  <text start="1067.559" dur="3.87">because instead of needing to one</text>
  <text start="1069.08" dur="5.38">container now you need one and a half</text>
