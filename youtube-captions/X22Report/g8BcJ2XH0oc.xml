  <text start="191.12" dur="4.86">Justice Department and federal Federal</text>
  <text start="193.1" dur="5.25">Bureau of Investigation outright hid</text>
  <text start="195.98" dur="6.33">critical information from a</text>
  <text start="198.35" dur="6.03">congressional investigation and a lot of</text>
  <text start="202.31" dur="5.49">the information that they were hiding is</text>
  <text start="204.38" dur="6.09">that there was a plant inside of the</text>
  <text start="207.8" dur="7.02">Trump campaign I mean this is going far</text>
  <text start="210.47" dur="7.68">down into the deep rabbit hole of the</text>
  <text start="214.82" dur="6.84">deep state and how far they have gone</text>
  <text start="218.15" dur="6.33">and Q did say this now is these are</text>
  <text start="221.66" dur="5.46">these individuals the plants well we</text>
  <text start="224.48" dur="6.29">don&amp;#39;t know as of yet but this still is</text>
  <text start="227.12" dur="7.92">very interesting now we understand that</text>
  <text start="230.77" dur="6.49">Trump is mixing this Iran Treaty which</text>
  <text start="235.04" dur="4.919">the Senate never approved this was done</text>
  <text start="237.26" dur="5.34">behind closed doors with Obama again</text>
  <text start="239.959" dur="5.121">this is information that is not viewable</text>
  <text start="242.6" dur="5.85">to the public and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="245.08" dur="6.73">secretive stuff inside of these of this</text>
  <text start="248.45" dur="4.5">agreement with Europe with Iran and many</text>
  <text start="251.81" dur="4.5">of the players which we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="252.95" dur="6.33">discussing and Europe right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="256.31" dur="4.5">looking at the situation and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="259.28" dur="3.99">trying to figure out what their next</text>
  <text start="260.81" dur="5.63">step is because remember the Iranians</text>
  <text start="263.27" dur="8.07">receiving funds from the US the funds</text>
  <text start="266.44" dur="8.979">are gone what does this mean for Europe</text>
  <text start="271.34" dur="5.13">so France right now Makran is saying</text>
  <text start="275.419" dur="2.671">that they&amp;#39;re going to be pushing back</text>
  <text start="276.47" dur="4.41">against the threat of US sanctions</text>
  <text start="278.09" dur="6.329">against French companies doing business</text>
  <text start="280.88" dur="7.11">with Iran because right now we know that</text>
  <text start="284.419" dur="6.631">there are sanctions there are the pull</text>
  <text start="287.99" dur="4.71">out of the Iranian deal and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="291.05" dur="3.66">know what to make of this they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="292.7" dur="3.81">know what to do they&amp;#39;re nervous and</text>
  <text start="294.71" dur="3.75">afraid the question is why are they</text>
  <text start="296.51" dur="4.35">nervous and afraid they&amp;#39;re nervous and</text>
  <text start="298.46" dur="5.37">afraid is because because they&amp;#39;re afraid</text>
  <text start="300.86" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;re going to be exposed to what this</text>
  <text start="303.83" dur="5.25">deal really was and they&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="307.07" dur="3.27">options they&amp;#39;re gonna have to make a</text>
  <text start="309.08" dur="2.88">decision on what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="310.34" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;re gonna get into that a little bit</text>
  <text start="311.96" dur="6.69">but I just want to go back a little bit</text>
  <text start="314.12" dur="6.28">to why Iran and Syria are so important</text>
  <text start="318.65" dur="5.86">and why all of this is has</text>
  <text start="320.4" dur="6.45">right now and we talked about how this</text>
  <text start="324.51" dur="4.59">Iranian deal and allowing Israel to</text>
  <text start="326.85" dur="5.51">attack Syria from the south is basically</text>
  <text start="329.1" dur="6.36">going too hard in Syria with Russia and</text>
  <text start="332.36" dur="6.52">eventually keep Israel out of Syria</text>
  <text start="335.46" dur="6.57">completely and expose those individuals</text>
  <text start="338.88" dur="7.47">who have been working with the terrorist</text>
  <text start="342.03" dur="10.53">groups because they need Syria and Iran</text>
  <text start="346.35" dur="9.72">to be controlled where the terrorists</text>
  <text start="352.56" dur="5.579">are out of the country where the leaders</text>
  <text start="356.07" dur="5.36">of those countries have full control of</text>
  <text start="358.139" dur="7.081">the entire territory of their country</text>
  <text start="361.43" dur="5.13">the reason for this and Trump is working</text>
  <text start="365.22" dur="4.08">with China he meets with Xi Jinping</text>
  <text start="366.56" dur="5.32">quite often because this is the plan</text>
  <text start="369.3" dur="4.41">this is part of the plan which we could</text>
  <text start="371.88" dur="5.49">see with North Korea in North Korea they</text>
  <text start="373.71" dur="6.51">needed the deep state out of there they</text>
  <text start="377.37" dur="5.519">needed Kim Jung hoon on board why for</text>
  <text start="380.22" dur="7.29">the one belt one road let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="382.889" dur="7.951">Syria right now China has been getting</text>
  <text start="387.51" dur="6.3">closer and closer to Syria China is</text>
  <text start="390.84" dur="5.43">interested in Syria for its potential</text>
  <text start="393.81" dur="4.59">role in the one belt one Road initiative</text>
  <text start="396.27" dur="5.43">because they want to use the ports of</text>
  <text start="398.4" dur="6.63">Latakia and tardis on the matter</text>
  <text start="401.7" dur="6.149">Mediterranean Sea if Syria is to play</text>
  <text start="405.03" dur="5.19">any sort of meaningful role in the one</text>
  <text start="407.849" dur="6.181">belt one Road then the government must</text>
  <text start="410.22" dur="7.41">have control of its territory if we look</text>
  <text start="414.03" dur="6.6">at Iran China and ran the two countries</text>
  <text start="417.63" dur="7.17">have a profound friendship for thousands</text>
  <text start="420.63" dur="8.819">of years and they want to use Iran as a</text>
  <text start="424.8" dur="7.41">hub for transporting goods on the Silk</text>
  <text start="429.449" dur="4.711">Road Iran has been a key partner within</text>
  <text start="432.21" dur="6.389">the belt and Road framework and they</text>
  <text start="434.16" dur="7.56">need the push to have regime change to</text>
  <text start="438.599" dur="6.54">Oh to have war with Iran and everything</text>
  <text start="441.72" dur="7.35">else they need this to stop and these</text>
  <text start="445.139" dur="7.171">two countries are very very important to</text>
  <text start="449.07" dur="4.71">China to Russia to the new economic</text>
  <text start="452.31" dur="3.329">system</text>
  <text start="453.78" dur="3.69">I believe Trump is part of this just</text>
  <text start="455.639" dur="5.25">like North Korea was very important to</text>
  <text start="457.47" dur="5.669">the one belt one road now yesterday we</text>
  <text start="460.889" dur="4.741">talked about how Israel was making</text>
  <text start="463.139" dur="5.791">attacks in the southern area of Syria</text>
  <text start="465.63" dur="5.19">and of course the rebel forces they</text>
  <text start="468.93" dur="5.37">mounted an offensive it didn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="470.82" dur="5.67">anywhere but again how did they know to</text>
  <text start="474.3" dur="4.41">mount that offense during this missile</text>
  <text start="476.49" dur="4.56">attack unless they were told that this</text>
  <text start="478.71" dur="4.32">was going to happen and I said what</text>
  <text start="481.05" dur="4.44">eventually is going to happen is Russia</text>
  <text start="483.03" dur="4.08">they mentioned it many times before that</text>
  <text start="485.49" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re going to bring in the s-300</text>
  <text start="487.11" dur="4.59">missile system and I find it very</text>
  <text start="489.09" dur="5.1">interesting that says Russia is not</text>
  <text start="491.7" dur="6.27">supplying the s-300 air defense system</text>
  <text start="494.19" dur="4.38">to Syria as of yet now Peskov said the</text>
  <text start="497.97" dur="2.55">following</text>
  <text start="498.57" dur="4.53">we never announced these deliveries as</text>
  <text start="500.52" dur="4.89">such however we said that after the</text>
  <text start="503.1" dur="5.31">strikes by US France and the UK on Syria</text>
  <text start="505.41" dur="6.6">Russia reserves the right to do whatever</text>
  <text start="508.41" dur="5.34">it deems necessary and they&amp;#39;re bringing</text>
  <text start="512.01" dur="3.899">this up now because I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="513.75" dur="4.71">basically saying listen if this</text>
  <text start="515.909" dur="3.901">continues we&amp;#39;re going to bring in the</text>
  <text start="518.46" dur="5.009">s-300 system</text>
  <text start="519.81" dur="7.07">now remember Netanyahu met with Putin on</text>
  <text start="523.469" dur="6.751">May 9th before all this happen and</text>
  <text start="526.88" dur="4.959">following the talks the Israeli prime</text>
  <text start="530.22" dur="3.15">minister said he has no reason to</text>
  <text start="531.839" dur="4.201">believe that Russia will attempt to</text>
  <text start="533.37" dur="7.56">limit Israel&amp;#39;s freedom of operation in</text>
  <text start="536.04" dur="8.61">the region Putin is playing him Putin is</text>
  <text start="540.93" dur="7.5">allowing Israel to do this why do you</text>
  <text start="544.65" dur="6.36">think he wants Israel to basically go in</text>
  <text start="548.43" dur="6.6">and destroy the Syrian Armed Forces or</text>
  <text start="551.01" dur="6.03">the Iranian armed forces Iran is a</text>
  <text start="555.03" dur="5.04">partner with Russia they&amp;#39;ve been working</text>
  <text start="557.04" dur="5.03">together Syria is a partner with Iran</text>
  <text start="560.07" dur="4.17">and Russia they&amp;#39;ve been working together</text>
  <text start="562.07" dur="4.69">they&amp;#39;ve been working and spending a lot</text>
  <text start="564.24" dur="3.57">of money in Syria to clear the</text>
  <text start="566.76" dur="4.56">terrorists out of there they know</text>
  <text start="567.81" dur="4.74">exactly who controls the terrorists who</text>
  <text start="571.32" dur="3.69">supports the terrorists they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="572.55" dur="3.87">stupid they knew exactly where the oil</text>
  <text start="575.01" dur="3.69">convoy was and it didn&amp;#39;t take him that</text>
  <text start="576.42" dur="6.51">much didn&amp;#39;t take him that much time to</text>
  <text start="578.7" dur="6.48">destroy the funding of the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="582.93" dur="4.769">all they did was destroy the convoy and</text>
  <text start="585.18" dur="5.129">said hey Berta Juan</text>
  <text start="587.699" dur="5.7">and your son you&amp;#39;re receiving the</text>
  <text start="590.309" dur="5.55">profits from all this oil and this is</text>
  <text start="593.399" dur="3.84">how the Islamic state is that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="595.859" dur="3.15">receiving the oil and you&amp;#39;re sending the</text>
  <text start="597.239" dur="4.31">money to the Islamic state this is how</text>
  <text start="599.009" dur="5.64">this whole thing&amp;#39;s being funded and</text>
  <text start="601.549" dur="4.87">Putin called man on this and then all of</text>
  <text start="604.649" dur="4.59">a sudden turkey decided to shoot down a</text>
  <text start="606.419" dur="6.27">Russian jet now Putin could have gone to</text>
  <text start="609.239" dur="7.44">war at that time but he didn&amp;#39;t now he</text>
  <text start="612.689" dur="6.93">has control over her to one and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="616.679" dur="6.27">allowing Israel to do this because he</text>
  <text start="619.619" dur="6.72">wants to make the case of why they need</text>
  <text start="622.949" dur="6.781">to bring in the s-300 system to protect</text>
  <text start="626.339" dur="5.701">the southern area once that airspace is</text>
  <text start="629.73" dur="7.049">locked down guess what</text>
  <text start="632.04" dur="7.319">game over and he knew that they were</text>
  <text start="636.779" dur="5.34">going to come into this area and do this</text>
  <text start="639.359" dur="6.78">but they didn&amp;#39;t spend all this time to</text>
  <text start="642.119" dur="6.481">allow the moderate rebels the terrorist</text>
  <text start="646.139" dur="5.04">groups to make any advancement that</text>
  <text start="648.6" dur="5.13">would be absolutely ridiculous at this</text>
  <text start="651.179" dur="5.88">point in time so we see right now that</text>
  <text start="653.73" dur="4.799">all of this is in motion and if we go</text>
  <text start="657.059" dur="3">back in time let&amp;#39;s take a look at how</text>
  <text start="658.529" dur="4.26">the s-300 story has developed since</text>
  <text start="660.059" dur="4.74">mid-april first reports about the</text>
  <text start="662.789" dur="3.9">possible s-300 surface-to-air missile</text>
  <text start="664.799" dur="4.111">system delivery to syria appeared</text>
  <text start="666.689" dur="5.221">following a joint missile strike by the</text>

  <text start="700.289" dur="4.29">quoting military diplomatic sources that</text>
  <text start="702.359" dur="5.88">Russia could deliver its s-300 missile</text>
  <text start="704.579" dur="6.331">system to Syria within one month at on</text>

  <text start="712.919" dur="6.03">missile system hadn&amp;#39;t been decided upon</text>

  <text start="787.459" dur="9.041">well we need to look at the situation</text>
  <text start="791.16" dur="7.649">here one we see that if they continue</text>
  <text start="796.5" dur="4.139">with the deal they&amp;#39;re gonna have to come</text>
  <text start="798.809" dur="4.38">up with payments to Iran to keep them</text>
  <text start="800.639" dur="4.44">quiet they can work together to pull</text>

  <text start="807.059" dur="4.561">where are they going to get the funds</text>
  <text start="808.939" dur="6.551">one of these countries aren&amp;#39;t doing that</text>
  <text start="811.62" dur="7.139">well and a lot of them don&amp;#39;t want to pay</text>

  <text start="818.759" dur="6.93">exposed down the road this is what</text>
  <text start="821.579" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re most afraid of number two it</text>
  <text start="825.689" dur="5.64">looks like they might have to go along</text>
  <text start="827.189" dur="6.51">with Trump&amp;#39;s plan to say you know</text>
  <text start="831.329" dur="5.07">something maybe we should rework this</text>
