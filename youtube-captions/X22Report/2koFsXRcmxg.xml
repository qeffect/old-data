  <text start="224.15" dur="3.51">not the gauge of the economy but we know</text>
  <text start="226.13" dur="4.08">that the mainstream media the central</text>
  <text start="227.66" dur="5.37">bank going back in time they use this to</text>
  <text start="230.21" dur="4.92">convince the people that this is the</text>
  <text start="233.03" dur="5.52">gauge of the economy they kept referring</text>
  <text start="235.13" dur="5.15">to it Trump is using this against the</text>
  <text start="238.55" dur="4.35">central bank of the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="240.28" dur="4.18">they can&amp;#39;t touch that but think about</text>
  <text start="242.9" dur="4.52">everything that Trump of the Patriots</text>

  <text start="587.24" dur="10.04">economy will continue to slow how does</text>
  <text start="592.13" dur="8">the central bank explain this because</text>
  <text start="597.28" dur="5.89">probably by the middle of 2020 I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="600.13" dur="5.71">believing that the entire deal between</text>
  <text start="603.17" dur="4.61">the US and China will be made there&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="605.84" dur="5.49">be no Terra still will be no trade war</text>
