  <text start="173.76" dur="7.27">report them to authorities and this is</text>
  <text start="178.209" dur="4.98">what we&amp;#39;re seeing this is a repeat of</text>
  <text start="181.03" dur="4.14">what Nazi Germany wanted to do to their</text>
  <text start="183.189" dur="5.16">people they wanted people to tell on</text>
  <text start="185.17" dur="5.67">others who are not in line with the</text>
  <text start="188.349" dur="6">government narrative those people that</text>
  <text start="190.84" dur="6.479">might be thinking other thoughts and if</text>
  <text start="194.349" dur="5.161">there is a potential threat you know you</text>
  <text start="197.319" dur="5.271">need to report it but how do you know</text>
  <text start="199.51" dur="5.55">something is a potential threat because</text>
  <text start="202.59" dur="4.36">you don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on I mean</text>
  <text start="205.06" dur="4.14">just because you see propane or just</text>
  <text start="206.95" dur="7.17">because you see toxic material doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="209.2" dur="6.27">mean that this is a threat to anybody so</text>
  <text start="214.12" dur="3.3">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="215.47" dur="4.079">taking this they&amp;#39;re taking all the</text>
  <text start="217.42" dur="3.989">information they want people to point</text>
  <text start="219.549" dur="3.541">fingers at each other and they want all</text>
  <text start="221.409" dur="3.541">this information to correlate it into a</text>
  <text start="223.09" dur="5.82">centralized database where they can sift</text>
  <text start="224.95" dur="7.61">through it and this helps them locate</text>
  <text start="228.91" dur="7.859">those people who need to be located and</text>
  <text start="232.56" dur="9.22">then these people then are watched this</text>
  <text start="236.769" dur="9.09">is what this app is all about now out in</text>
  <text start="241.78" dur="6.84">Ukraine we see the power outage is still</text>
  <text start="245.859" dur="4.74">going on Russia is looking at the</text>
  <text start="248.62" dur="4.89">situation and saying this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="250.599" dur="6.661">ridiculous and they&amp;#39;re devising a</text>
  <text start="253.51" dur="5.659">retaliatory measures if Ukraine does not</text>
  <text start="257.26" dur="4.86">restore the electricity there and</text>
  <text start="259.169" dur="6.31">there&amp;#39;s about up to 2.5 million crimeans</text>
  <text start="262.12" dur="5.1">without electric whatsoever and they</text>
  <text start="265.479" dur="4.68">have declared a state of emergency in</text>
  <text start="267.22" dur="5.4">Crimea and at the same time all this is</text>
  <text start="270.159" dur="5.371">happening yak milk came out and said</text>
  <text start="272.62" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;re closing all flights across</text>
  <text start="275.53" dur="6.449">Ukraine Russia air carriers will not be</text>
  <text start="279.28" dur="6.21">allowed they&amp;#39;re closing the airspace</text>
  <text start="281.979" dur="7.261">which is very interesting Ukraine has</text>
  <text start="285.49" dur="5.609">stopped the Russian gas supply they</text>
  <text start="289.24" dur="3.179">didn&amp;#39;t pay for any more gas coming into</text>
  <text start="291.099" dur="3.031">the country they filled up their tanks</text>
  <text start="292.419" dur="4.591">for this winter so they&amp;#39;re cutting off</text>
  <text start="294.13" dur="4.23">that off right now and all of this is</text>
  <text start="297.01" dur="4.17">leading to one</text>
  <text start="298.36" dur="6.63">and one thing only that is a major</text>
  <text start="301.18" dur="5.639">offensive in Ukraine because when we</text>
  <text start="304.99" dur="3.6">look at the situation we see the United</text>
  <text start="306.819" dur="3.921">States government central bankers they</text>
  <text start="308.59" dur="5">are losing their proxy army forces in</text>
  <text start="310.74" dur="5.889">Syria their backs are against the wall</text>
  <text start="313.59" dur="5.919">Yemen is a disaster Libya&amp;#39;s disaster</text>
  <text start="316.629" dur="5.25">Lebanon is a disaster iraq as a disaster</text>
  <text start="319.509" dur="4.59">and they really wanted to get into Syria</text>
  <text start="321.879" dur="4.44">to put the dollar on the Natural</text>
  <text start="324.099" dur="4.651">Resources set up a pipeline and</text>
  <text start="326.319" dur="5.22">eventually go into Iran all of this is</text>
  <text start="328.75" dur="4.74">not working out so now they need to</text>
  <text start="331.539" dur="3.66">start this war all over the place and</text>
  <text start="333.49" dur="4.35">everything is being built up right now</text>
  <text start="335.199" dur="5.761">and getting prepared for this now out in</text>
  <text start="337.84" dur="6.9">Libya Frances defense minister says</text>
  <text start="340.96" dur="6.989">listen you must create a new government</text>
  <text start="344.74" dur="4.62">right now in Libya so we can stop the</text>
  <text start="347.949" dur="4.201">Islamic state from taking over the</text>
  <text start="349.36" dur="5.429">country so they already have plans right</text>
  <text start="352.15" dur="5.85">now and we knew this was coming they are</text>
  <text start="354.789" dur="7.35">basically giving them an ultimatum form</text>
  <text start="358" dur="5.909">this new unified government where the</text>
  <text start="362.139" dur="3.27">elected government will lose all power</text>
  <text start="363.909" dur="5.25">and the puppet government will be in</text>
  <text start="365.409" dur="6.75">power or basically we&amp;#39;re going to send</text>
  <text start="369.159" dur="5.43">the proxy army into Libya and it will</text>
  <text start="372.159" dur="5.43">put you into war a war like you&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="374.589" dur="4.89">seen before this is the threat to Libya</text>
  <text start="377.589" dur="5.73">and then the United States will try to</text>
  <text start="379.479" dur="8.071">use this to go into Libya now we</text>
  <text start="383.319" dur="8.041">understand the Russian su-24 was shot</text>
  <text start="387.55" dur="5.789">down yesterday turkey was trying to make</text>
  <text start="391.36" dur="4.29">excuses of why they shot it down and</text>
  <text start="393.339" dur="5.61">we&amp;#39;re finding out that the jet wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="395.65" dur="6.629">even in the airspace of Turkey at this</text>
  <text start="398.949" dur="6.451">point and one of the pilots was rescued</text>
  <text start="402.279" dur="5.521">and he was saying that it&amp;#39;s impossible</text>
  <text start="405.4" dur="4.139">that we violated the airspace even for a</text>
  <text start="407.8" dur="4.799">second we were flying in an altitude of</text>
  <text start="409.539" dur="4.951">about 6,000 meters in completely clear</text>
  <text start="412.599" dur="4.74">weather and he said he had total control</text>
  <text start="414.49" dur="5.959">of the plane and he said there were no</text>
  <text start="417.339" dur="6.39">warning shots there was no visuals or</text>
  <text start="420.449" dur="6.161">anything it came out of the blue and hit</text>
  <text start="423.729" dur="5.011">us from behind the missile and Russian</text>
  <text start="426.61" dur="5.279">planes they weren&amp;#39;t looking for an</text>
  <text start="428.74" dur="6.179">air-to-air missile hitting them because</text>
  <text start="431.889" dur="4.351">you know basically turkey was supposed</text>
  <text start="434.919" dur="4.68">to be fighting the Islamic state and the</text>
  <text start="436.24" dur="6.149">Islamic state does not have airplanes so</text>
  <text start="439.599" dur="5.641">they wouldn&amp;#39;t be looking for this and we</text>
  <text start="442.389" dur="6.691">can see right now this really took</text>
  <text start="445.24" dur="5.669">Russia by surprise now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="449.08" dur="3.44">interesting is turkey says you know we</text>
  <text start="450.909" dur="4.35">have a right defense to defend ourselves</text>
  <text start="452.52" dur="6.549">we have the right to shoot down a plane</text>
  <text start="455.259" dur="5.34">if it&amp;#39;s in our airspace but Greece is</text>
  <text start="459.069" dur="4.171">out there saying okay you&amp;#39;re kind of</text>
  <text start="460.599" dur="9.18">hypocritical right now because you</text>
  <text start="463.24" dur="9.239">violated our airspace 2244 times in 2014</text>
  <text start="469.779" dur="5.431">alone can you imagine what would happen</text>
  <text start="472.479" dur="5.761">if we decided to shoot down every single</text>
  <text start="475.21" dur="5.97">one of these planes and we know that a</text>
  <text start="478.24" dur="5.849">lot of times this does happen they give</text>
  <text start="481.18" dur="7.049">warnings signals they never go to the</text>
  <text start="484.089" dur="6.48">extreme of shooting down the plane so</text>
  <text start="488.229" dur="3.93">since Russia came out with their radar</text>
  <text start="490.569" dur="3.741">showing the plane never came in there</text>
  <text start="492.159" dur="7.111">and also the pilot who parachuted down</text>
  <text start="494.31" dur="8.109">landed in Syria not Turkey very</text>
  <text start="499.27" dur="6.66">interesting so turkey released a</text>
  <text start="502.419" dur="7.98">recording of the warning they were</text>
  <text start="505.93" dur="8.07">giving to the Russian pilot and this was</text>
  <text start="510.399" dur="6.601">given from a Lebanese airline and hand</text>
  <text start="514" dur="5.279">it over but what&amp;#39;s very strange about</text>
  <text start="517" dur="6.63">this is we have a Turkish pilot talking</text>
  <text start="519.279" dur="10.771">to a Russian pilot and the recording is</text>
  <text start="523.63" dur="11.04">in English so that&amp;#39;s kind of strange why</text>
  <text start="530.05" dur="7.44">would they be speaking in English they</text>
  <text start="534.67" dur="7.529">know it&amp;#39;s an su-24 they know it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="537.49" dur="6.719">Russian pilot so something is not clear</text>
  <text start="542.199" dur="3.63">here and again they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="544.209" dur="3.601">looking at this recording to see if this</text>
  <text start="545.829" dur="4.771">really is authentic I think they just</text>
  <text start="547.81" dur="4.86">produce this as more propaganda because</text>
  <text start="550.6" dur="5.82">Russia had the radar and the truth is</text>
  <text start="552.67" dur="6.09">coming out right now and Putin is saying</text>
  <text start="556.42" dur="6.859">absolutely the plane was brought down</text>
  <text start="558.76" dur="7.309">outside of Turkish airspace</text>
  <text start="563.279" dur="4.381">now Paul Craig Roberts is out there and</text>
  <text start="566.069" dur="3.541">saying yes turkey is completely lying</text>
  <text start="567.66" dur="4.619">and he has he gives three reasons right</text>
  <text start="569.61" dur="4.5">here and I completely agree with him did</text>
  <text start="572.279" dur="4.711">the calculation and he is absolutely</text>
  <text start="574.11" dur="5.339">right one reason is that we know NATO</text>
  <text start="576.99" dur="4.829">just lies all the time every time they</text>
  <text start="579.449" dur="5.221">say something it&amp;#39;s proven to be a</text>
  <text start="581.819" dur="5.01">complete lie the second is that turkey</text>
  <text start="584.67" dur="5.13">claims that the su-24 was in Turkey&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="586.829" dur="6.87">airspace for 17 seconds but only travel</text>
  <text start="589.8" dur="6.69">1.15 miles which means the su-24 was</text>
  <text start="593.699" dur="6.211">flying at stall speed the entire Western</text>
  <text start="596.49" dur="6.209">media was too incompetent to do the</text>
  <text start="599.91" dur="4.56">basic math he says a third reason is</text>
  <text start="602.699" dur="5.19">that assuming turkeys claim of a</text>
  <text start="604.47" dur="5.88">17-second airspace violation is true 17</text>
  <text start="607.889" dur="4.44">seconds is not long enough for a Turkish</text>
  <text start="610.35" dur="3.87">pilot to get clearance for such a</text>
  <text start="612.329" dur="6.99">serious and reckless act as shooting</text>
  <text start="614.22" dur="7.77">down a Russian aircraft and if the su-24</text>
  <text start="619.319" dur="4.171">was flying at normal speed rather than</text>
  <text start="621.99" dur="3.719">one that would be unable to keep the</text>
  <text start="623.49" dur="4.44">aircraft a flaw aloft the alleged</text>
  <text start="625.709" dur="5.961">airspace violation would not have been</text>
  <text start="627.93" dur="6.449">long enough to be noticed and I</text>
  <text start="631.67" dur="6.94">completely agree with this is that</text>
  <text start="634.379" dur="8.791">turkeys explanation makes no sense this</text>
  <text start="638.61" dur="6.599">was completely planned and of course</text>
  <text start="643.17" dur="3.959">turkey was out there saying the</text>
  <text start="645.209" dur="4.521">following but which they gave the</text>
  <text start="647.129" dur="5.88">explanation to the UN Security Council</text>
  <text start="649.73" dur="6.789">and it states that the morning November</text>
  <text start="653.009" dur="5.7">24th to su-24 planes the nationality of</text>
  <text start="656.519" dur="4.86">which are unknown have approached</text>
  <text start="658.709" dur="4.5">Turkish national airspace the planes in</text>
  <text start="661.379" dur="3.781">question have been warned 10 times</text>
  <text start="663.209" dur="4.081">during a period of five minutes via</text>
  <text start="665.16" dur="4.979">emergency Channel and asked to change</text>
  <text start="667.29" dur="5.399">their headings south immediately now 17</text>
  <text start="670.139" dur="5.611">seconds how can you warn someone ten</text>
  <text start="672.689" dur="7.14">times in 17 seconds first of all that</text>
  <text start="675.75" dur="8.49">makes no sense as the su-24 are Russian</text>
  <text start="679.829" dur="7.17">aircraft how can turkey not be able to</text>
  <text start="684.24" dur="5.25">identify them and if they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="686.999" dur="4.44">identify them why did they shoot at them</text>
  <text start="689.49" dur="5.67">what happens if it was an American plane</text>
  <text start="691.439" dur="8.791">or a French plane</text>
  <text start="695.16" dur="7.679">I mean this whole story makes no sense</text>
  <text start="700.23" dur="7.71">whatsoever at this point and they are</text>
  <text start="702.839" dur="9.661">caught in another lie so Russia has been</text>
  <text start="707.94" dur="7.04">pounding the left ikea area driving the</text>
  <text start="712.5" dur="5.55">forces back the islamic state back and</text>
  <text start="714.98" dur="7.26">Syrian government forces have gained the</text>
