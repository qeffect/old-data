  <text start="56.04" dur="4.08">as we can see the market is pretty much</text>
  <text start="58.559" dur="5.371">flat today hasn&amp;#39;t really gone anywhere</text>
  <text start="60.12" dur="7.37">gold was pushed up once again we see</text>
  <text start="63.93" dur="7.92">that gold is making gains we&amp;#39;re thirteen</text>
  <text start="67.49" dur="6.91">forty or so and we can see as time goes</text>
  <text start="71.85" dur="4.17">on we&amp;#39;re going to see gold rise even</text>
  <text start="74.4" dur="2.7">more now that doesn&amp;#39;t mean the central</text>
  <text start="76.02" dur="3.3">bankers aren&amp;#39;t going to come out and</text>

  <text start="82.17" dur="5.61">close to 1,400 most likely in the next</text>
  <text start="85.5" dur="4.44">couple of weeks and as we go forward</text>
  <text start="87.78" dur="4.08">we&amp;#39;re going to see gold gold move up</text>
  <text start="89.94" dur="3.45">even more because it&amp;#39;s becoming more and</text>
  <text start="91.86" dur="4.85">more difficult for these central bankers</text>
  <text start="93.39" dur="5.22">to suppress gold and silver and</text>
  <text start="96.71" dur="5.049">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="98.61" dur="7.499">they will lose control but when we look</text>
  <text start="101.759" dur="7.411">at the economy we see that almost every</text>
  <text start="106.109" dur="5.43">single indicator that we look at it is</text>
  <text start="109.17" dur="4.08">contracting and when we put everything</text>
  <text start="111.539" dur="4.411">together and we step back and we take a</text>
  <text start="113.25" dur="7.7">look at the big picture we see that this</text>
  <text start="115.95" dur="8.25">economy there is no recovery it&amp;#39;s a fact</text>
  <text start="120.95" dur="6.19">they can talk all they want they can say</text>
  <text start="124.2" dur="5.79">yes recovery believe me Obama can come</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="5.7">out there and tell you we are the Fed</text>
  <text start="129.99" dur="6.18">can continually say it looks strong but</text>
  <text start="132.84" dur="6.39">we&amp;#39;re not going to do anything the stock</text>
  <text start="136.17" dur="6.33">market can continually rise because the</text>
  <text start="139.23" dur="4.8">stock market is not the indicator of how</text>
  <text start="142.5" dur="3.3">the economy is doing that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="144.03" dur="3.78">manipulated indicator that the</text>
  <text start="145.8" dur="5.16">government uses to convince you that the</text>
  <text start="147.81" dur="6">economy is doing well and right now we</text>
  <text start="150.96" dur="4.65">see initial jobless claims they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="153.81" dur="3.66">inched up a little bit climb to about</text>
  <text start="155.61" dur="4.26">fourteen thousand to two hundred and</text>
  <text start="157.47" dur="5.36">sixty-six thousand and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="159.87" dur="4.6">doing right now is they&amp;#39;re manipulating</text>
  <text start="162.83" dur="5.03">most of this</text>
  <text start="164.47" dur="6.69">istics to keep this illusion alive now</text>
  <text start="167.86" dur="4.86">think about it we have stores laying off</text>
  <text start="171.16" dur="3.24">individuals and I know the part-time</text>
  <text start="172.72" dur="3.99">people of the working a certain number</text>
  <text start="174.4" dur="4.26">of hours each state varies they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="176.71" dur="3.21">count those people as being laid off I</text>
  <text start="178.66" dur="3.42">mean if they have the job they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="179.92" dur="4.85">counted as a full-time job but when</text>
  <text start="182.08" dur="6.36">they&amp;#39;re laid off they&amp;#39;re not counted and</text>
  <text start="184.77" dur="6.87">we&amp;#39;re seeing many corporations laying</text>
  <text start="188.44" dur="5.52">off thousands upon thousands of people</text>
  <text start="191.64" dur="4.84">but the initial jobless claims is its</text>
  <text start="193.96" dur="4.59">lowest we&amp;#39;ve ever seen I mean it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="196.48" dur="4.8">even make sense and you also have to</text>
  <text start="198.55" dur="3.93">remember back in 27 2013 the US</text>
  <text start="201.28" dur="5.91">government decided to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="202.48" dur="8.85">department that looks at layoffs because</text>
  <text start="207.19" dur="6.18">of budget constraints now we see on the</text>
  <text start="211.33" dur="4.08">corporate media they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="213.37" dur="3.45">the argument that because of sports</text>
  <text start="215.41" dur="4.23">authority the bankruptcy in total</text>
  <text start="216.82" dur="6.48">liquidation this might spell big trouble</text>
  <text start="219.64" dur="5.97">for other retailers saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="223.3" dur="6.26">concerned about the way they have been</text>
  <text start="225.61" dur="6.03">operating and this might spread now</text>
  <text start="229.56" dur="4.51">really what they&amp;#39;re trying to say is</text>
  <text start="231.64" dur="3.72">that the economy is falling apart people</text>
  <text start="234.07" dur="3.6">aren&amp;#39;t spending because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="235.36" dur="4.94">seeing stores like quicksilver american</text>
  <text start="237.67" dur="6.9">apparel we&amp;#39;ve been seeing aeropostale</text>
  <text start="240.3" dur="6.52">pacsun teen stalwarts i mean they all</text>
  <text start="244.57" dur="5.85">filed for bankruptcy and many others</text>
  <text start="246.82" dur="5.52">have closed many many stores so what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="250.42" dur="7.83">really happening here is that the</text>
  <text start="252.34" dur="7.59">economy is contracting people as they</text>
  <text start="258.25" dur="3.51">lose their jobs they can&amp;#39;t go out and</text>
  <text start="259.93" dur="3.87">spend but of course what they need to do</text>
  <text start="261.76" dur="5.1">at this point is they need to spin</text>
  <text start="263.8" dur="4.5">everything to try to explain this away</text>
  <text start="266.86" dur="3.21">they never mention the economy they</text>
  <text start="268.3" dur="3.869">never mentioned that wow there&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="270.07" dur="6.87">people unemployed they just can&amp;#39;t go and</text>
  <text start="272.169" dur="7.171">buy retail and they&amp;#39;ll never do it we</text>
