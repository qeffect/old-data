  <text start="118.49" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;ve been spying on the American</text>
  <text start="119.81" dur="6.839">people for quite a while and when the</text>
  <text start="123.35" dur="5.04">head of the NSA was asked you know are</text>
  <text start="126.649" dur="4.92">you spying on the American people and of</text>
  <text start="128.39" dur="5.01">course he said absolutely not and then</text>
  <text start="131.569" dur="5.011">later on we found out the truth that yes</text>
  <text start="133.4" dur="5.52">the agencies are spying on the American</text>
  <text start="136.58" dur="5.34">people also Edward Snowden came out with</text>
  <text start="138.92" dur="5.52">the revelation that yeah you&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="141.92" dur="3.99">being spied on now there&amp;#39;s a new report</text>
  <text start="144.44" dur="4.56">from the House Committee on Oversight</text>
  <text start="145.91" dur="6.39">and Government Reform and the US</text>
  <text start="149" dur="6.18">government extracted nearly 100 million</text>
  <text start="152.3" dur="6.9">from the taxpayers so the government</text>
  <text start="155.18" dur="5.91">could spy on the same taxpayers us the</text>
  <text start="159.2" dur="4.86">report found that more than 95 million</text>
  <text start="161.09" dur="5.67">was spent on 435 devices across the</text>
  <text start="164.06" dur="4.68">country in order to transform mobile</text>
  <text start="166.76" dur="4.83">devices into real time tracking devices</text>
  <text start="168.74" dur="5.06">and between 2010 and 2014</text>
  <text start="171.59" dur="6.78">the Department of Justice spent around</text>
  <text start="173.8" dur="7.389">71 million on 310 cell sites emulators</text>
  <text start="178.37" dur="4.84">which are known as stingrays these</text>
  <text start="181.189" dur="4.691">devices impersonate a cell phone</text>
  <text start="183.21" dur="6.18">hower and they collect your texts your</text>
  <text start="185.88" dur="5.61">calls your emails the Department of</text>
  <text start="189.39" dur="6.71">Homeland Security spend close to 25</text>
  <text start="191.49" dur="7.53">million on 124 state 124 stingrays and</text>
  <text start="196.1" dur="5.83">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is Congress</text>
  <text start="199.02" dur="6.48">is looking to adopt laws that restrict</text>
  <text start="201.93" dur="4.74">use of the Stingray citing that you know</text>
  <text start="205.5" dur="3.03">what violates the First and Fourth</text>
  <text start="206.67" dur="5.34">Amendment and this is absolutely</text>
  <text start="208.53" dur="6.15">ridiculous once again what&amp;#39;s the purpose</text>
  <text start="212.01" dur="4.65">of creating more and more laws if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="214.68" dur="4.35">not following the law of the land</text>
  <text start="216.66" dur="4.44">because all we need to do is refer back</text>
  <text start="219.03" dur="6">to the First and Fourth Amendment and</text>
  <text start="221.1" dur="8.18">say you violated this you are now find</text>
  <text start="225.03" dur="6.75">those people who violated are fired and</text>
  <text start="229.28" dur="5.8">you need to take all these down it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="231.78" dur="4.89">that simple making new laws if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="235.08" dur="4.59">not gonna follow them are worthless</text>
  <text start="236.67" dur="6.06">that&amp;#39;s why we have tens of thousands of</text>
  <text start="239.67" dur="5.58">laws on the books and if we don&amp;#39;t follow</text>
  <text start="242.73" dur="6.05">the original law what&amp;#39;s the purpose of</text>
  <text start="245.25" dur="6.03">all of it it is there is no purpose and</text>
  <text start="248.78" dur="6.37">they&amp;#39;re just going around and around and</text>
  <text start="251.28" dur="7.38">around go back to the basics that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="255.15" dur="5.76">we have to do we see that the US Customs</text>
  <text start="258.66" dur="5.1">and Border Protection well they started</text>
  <text start="260.91" dur="5.43">demand that foreign travelers hand over</text>
  <text start="263.76" dur="3.69">Facebook Twitter and other social media</text>
  <text start="266.34" dur="4.89">account information</text>
  <text start="267.45" dur="5.67">upon entering the country the new policy</text>
  <text start="271.23" dur="4.05">follows a proposal laid out back in June</text>
  <text start="273.12" dur="3.6">and applies only to those travelers who</text>
  <text start="275.28" dur="3.48">enter the u.s. temporarily without a</text>
  <text start="276.72" dur="5.4">visa through the electronic system for</text>
  <text start="278.76" dur="5.49">Travel Authorization the goal the</text>
  <text start="282.12" dur="2.76">government says is to identify potential</text>
  <text start="284.25" dur="3.27">threats</text>
  <text start="284.88" dur="4.05">well activists are out there and they</text>
  <text start="287.52" dur="2.91">fear that this policy could be a threat</text>
  <text start="288.93" dur="4.31">to human rights which I do believe</text>
  <text start="290.43" dur="5.1">because we know they just don&amp;#39;t stop at</text>
  <text start="293.24" dur="6.85">individuals coming into this country who</text>
  <text start="295.53" dur="6.3">are foreigners again they always take</text>
  <text start="300.09" dur="3.96">this to the next step later on once</text>
  <text start="301.83" dur="3.68">everyone agrees yet yes we should be</text>
  <text start="304.05" dur="3.96">doing it to this group of people and</text>
  <text start="305.51" dur="5.38">then all of a sudden they say okay now</text>
  <text start="308.01" dur="5.07">let&amp;#39;s move it to Americans who are</text>
  <text start="310.89" dur="5.07">traveling back into the country we need</text>
  <text start="313.08" dur="3.959">just to check you know who you say you</text>
  <text start="315.96" dur="4.56">are and</text>
  <text start="317.039" dur="6.63">maybe you have met with terrorists out</text>
  <text start="320.52" dur="6.149">in other countries and this becomes very</text>
  <text start="323.669" dur="4.86">very dangerous because once they set</text>
  <text start="326.669" dur="4.14">this precedent they can move it to other</text>
  <text start="328.529" dur="5.13">things and you need to hand over your</text>
  <text start="330.809" dur="5.07">bank account information so we can check</text>
  <text start="333.659" dur="4.41">to see maybe you&amp;#39;re doing some money</text>
  <text start="335.879" dur="4.71">laundering we want to see where your</text>
  <text start="338.069" dur="5.07">purchases are where if you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="340.589" dur="7.341">spending your money and we can see right</text>
  <text start="343.139" dur="7.5">now that this is very very dangerous and</text>
  <text start="347.93" dur="4.509">it&amp;#39;s unclear if the information</text>
  <text start="350.639" dur="3.9">collected can be immediately used to</text>
  <text start="352.439" dur="4.801">deny travellers entry into the u.s.</text>
  <text start="354.539" dur="4.47">however the express purpose of the</text>
  <text start="357.24" dur="4.829">collection is to identify individuals</text>
  <text start="359.009" dur="5.13">with ties to terrorist groups which does</text>
  <text start="362.069" dur="5.37">this really tell you that you&amp;#39;re part of</text>
  <text start="364.139" dur="5.131">a terrorist group no because this</text>
  <text start="367.439" dur="5.31">information could be faked and once</text>
  <text start="369.27" dur="6.959">people learn that they&amp;#39;re collecting</text>
  <text start="372.749" dur="5.46">this information well guess what they</text>
  <text start="376.229" dur="4.261">can make up a second account and say</text>
  <text start="378.209" dur="4.05">yeah look at this account so this is</text>
  <text start="380.49" dur="3.06">absolutely ridiculous we know this is</text>
  <text start="382.259" dur="4.291">not what they&amp;#39;re really using it for</text>
  <text start="383.55" dur="5.13">they want to track each individual</text>
  <text start="386.55" dur="5.009">person they want to know what you&amp;#39;re up</text>
  <text start="388.68" dur="4.68">to what you&amp;#39;re doing because anybody can</text>
  <text start="391.559" dur="3.72">make duplet accounts and give it over to</text>
  <text start="393.36" dur="4.739">the people and show absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="395.279" dur="5.7">on there so this is a waste of time the</text>
  <text start="398.099" dur="6.3">only reason they want this is because</text>
  <text start="400.979" dur="8.66">they want to track people now we see</text>
  <text start="404.399" dur="9.51">today in the UN the UN voted to condemn</text>
  <text start="409.639" dur="7.12">Israel&amp;#39;s settlements Israel lashed out</text>
  <text start="413.909" dur="4.831">at the Obama administration saying that</text>
  <text start="416.759" dur="5.43">friends don&amp;#39;t act that way after their</text>
  <text start="418.74" dur="6.389">ambassador power abstained refusing to</text>
  <text start="422.189" dur="4.56">veto the United Nations resolution</text>
  <text start="425.129" dur="4.231">demanding Israel to stop settlement</text>
  <text start="426.749" dur="6.75">building on the occupied Palestinian</text>
  <text start="429.36" dur="6.859">territory and I know that Trump well he</text>
  <text start="433.499" dur="5.52">was trying to postpone the vote here and</text>
  <text start="436.219" dur="6.391">we can see that many of the other</text>
  <text start="439.019" dur="5.88">countries decided to overrule this and</text>
  <text start="442.61" dur="5.469">other countries on the 15-member</text>
  <text start="444.899" dur="5.151">Security Council well they said we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="448.079" dur="4.34">going ahead with the vote</text>
  <text start="450.05" dur="4.709">and they snatched the resolution away</text>
  <text start="452.419" dur="5.851">from Egypt and they put it for a vote on</text>
  <text start="454.759" dur="6.06">Friday and it passed 14 votes in favor</text>
  <text start="458.27" dur="5.519">and the United States the United States</text>
  <text start="460.819" dur="3.72">abstained we see that the Russian</text>
  <text start="463.789" dur="4.171">military</text>
  <text start="464.539" dur="5.791">well they&amp;#39;ve sent in the police into</text>
  <text start="467.96" dur="6.54">Aleppo they&amp;#39;re going to help maintain</text>
  <text start="470.33" dur="6.239">security in the area and we see right</text>
  <text start="474.5" dur="4.56">now that they&amp;#39;re trying to keep control</text>
  <text start="476.569" dur="4.5">of the entire area the United States</text>
  <text start="479.06" dur="4.289">because of what&amp;#39;s happening in Syria</text>
  <text start="481.069" dur="5.431">they decided to sanction Russia once</text>
  <text start="483.349" dur="5.25">again and the US has added nine</text>
  <text start="486.5" dur="5.219">officials of the Moscow based temp bank</text>
  <text start="488.599" dur="5.461">to its sanctioned blacklist anyone that</text>
  <text start="491.719" dur="4.651">had dealings with the government of</text>
  <text start="494.06" dur="6.18">Syria including the Central Bank of</text>
  <text start="496.37" dur="7.56">Syria or serious state oil marketing</text>
  <text start="500.24" dur="6.829">firms they were all sanctioned and this</text>
  <text start="503.93" dur="5.519">is a move to put pressure on Russia</text>
  <text start="507.069" dur="4.69">hoping they will do something but we can</text>
  <text start="509.449" dur="4.08">see from what Putin has done he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="511.759" dur="3.45">make moves like this he says okay you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="513.529" dur="3.12">going to sanction us we&amp;#39;ll move away</text>
  <text start="515.209" dur="4.861">from the dollar and each time this</text>
  <text start="516.649" dur="5.551">happens he moves his country further and</text>
  <text start="520.07" dur="5.19">further away from the dollar dumps</text>
  <text start="522.2" dur="6.27">Treasuries makes deals with other</text>
  <text start="525.26" dur="7.41">countries and this plan is not working</text>
  <text start="528.47" dur="7.23">at this point we see that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="532.67" dur="5.43">Armed Forces they&amp;#39;ve discovered several</text>
  <text start="535.7" dur="5.4">jails and torture centers after</text>
  <text start="538.1" dur="5.58">regaining control of eastern Aleppo they</text>
  <text start="541.1" dur="5.82">found about 20 different places used for</text>
  <text start="543.68" dur="7.5">trials and over 500 identity cards of</text>
  <text start="546.92" dur="6.81">people who were detained tortured by the</text>
  <text start="551.18" dur="6.54">moderate rebels the Islamic state al</text>
  <text start="553.73" dur="7.26">Qaeda al nusra al sham and they also</text>
  <text start="557.72" dur="7.02">found mouths graves in the area and he</text>
  <text start="560.99" dur="5.73">said the main people that were tortured</text>
  <text start="564.74" dur="6.36">and then murdered were high-ranking</text>
  <text start="566.72" dur="6.679">people of the society and we can see why</text>
  <text start="571.1" dur="4.71">they were doing this they were trying to</text>
  <text start="573.399" dur="4.781">get rid of those individuals that were</text>
  <text start="575.81" dur="3.839">in power in that area show the people</text>
  <text start="578.18" dur="4.98">that this is what&amp;#39;s going to happen to</text>
  <text start="579.649" dur="4.261">you and then once again it was the</text>
  <text start="583.16" dur="3">terrorists</text>
  <text start="583.91" dur="4.41">that were doing all of this now of</text>
  <text start="586.16" dur="5.13">course the corporate media is out there</text>
  <text start="588.32" dur="5.37">trying to convince everyone that since</text>
  <text start="591.29" dur="4.5">Aleppo has been liberated the Syrian</text>
  <text start="593.69" dur="3.54">Armed Forces Russia they&amp;#39;re moving into</text>
  <text start="595.79" dur="5.4">the area and they&amp;#39;re just killing people</text>

  <text start="795.03" dur="6.06">we&amp;#39;re seeing is that they&amp;#39;re showing</text>
  <text start="797.79" dur="6.9">this Islamic state video of two men</text>
  <text start="801.09" dur="5.82">burning once again it was looks like it</text>
  <text start="804.69" dur="5.3">was created in a Hollywood studio and</text>
