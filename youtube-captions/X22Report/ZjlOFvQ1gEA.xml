  <text start="197.65" dur="5.76">closer at these numbers and remember we</text>
  <text start="201.73" dur="4.86">talked about this before and how they</text>
  <text start="203.41" dur="7.05">count sales sales are counted when cars</text>
  <text start="206.59" dur="6.51">are delivered to the dealership lot not</text>
  <text start="210.46" dur="5.52">when the cars are sold to people so they</text>
  <text start="213.1" dur="5.85">channel stuff and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="215.98" dur="5.37">right now is that this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="218.95" dur="6.69">they&amp;#39;re doing but what they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="221.35" dur="6.21">doing well GM is doing they have done</text>
  <text start="225.64" dur="8.57">something very interesting it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="227.56" dur="8.88">what they did back in 2006 2007 2008</text>
  <text start="234.21" dur="5.74">well what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is</text>
  <text start="236.44" dur="7.35">they&amp;#39;re giving incentives and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="239.95" dur="10.56">giving a lot of incentives about 5437</text>
  <text start="243.79" dur="10.14">per vehicle and GM&amp;#39;s inventory well it</text>
  <text start="250.51" dur="6.18">continually increases right now their</text>
  <text start="253.93" dur="6.989">inventory is increased to ten days</text>
  <text start="256.69" dur="6.66">year-on-year to 71 days of supply now to</text>
  <text start="260.919" dur="3.841">put that into perspective GM had about</text>
  <text start="263.35" dur="4.11">six hundred and thirty thousand nine</text>
  <text start="264.76" dur="5.22">hundred and fifty unsold cars sitting on</text>

  <text start="274.09" dur="7.65">cars as of December 2016 a 214,000 unit</text>
  <text start="279.28" dur="5.43">increase year-on-year see where the</text>
  <text start="281.74" dur="5.58">sales are coming from and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="284.71" dur="6.24">doing is they&amp;#39;re pumping the bubble up</text>
  <text start="287.32" dur="5.099">look what they had to do to get the</text>
  <text start="290.95" dur="4.08">sales where they needed to go</text>
  <text start="292.419" dur="4.321">they had a channel stuff the interest</text>
  <text start="295.03" dur="4.23">rates are very low and they had to open</text>
  <text start="296.74" dur="5.49">up the subprime market does that sound</text>
  <text start="299.26" dur="5.22">like a recovery to you well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="302.23" dur="4.439">doing it in the auto industry they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="304.48" dur="3.99">doing it in the mortgage industry but</text>
  <text start="306.669" dur="3.661">what we&amp;#39;re seeing as the interest rates</text>
  <text start="308.47" dur="4.08">move up a little bit now they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="310.33" dur="4.86">a little bit of a problem because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="312.55" dur="2.94">seeing mortgage applications they tumble</text>
  <text start="315.19" dur="3.75">decor</text>
  <text start="315.49" dur="6.35">a two-week holiday period and we see</text>
  <text start="318.94" dur="8.3">mortgage applications and refinancings</text>
  <text start="321.84" dur="9.609">well they are way down down over 60%</text>
  <text start="327.24" dur="7.45">since August the refi Index crashed over</text>
  <text start="331.449" dur="8.69">22% over the Christmas new year period</text>
  <text start="334.69" dur="8.55">to its lowest since October of 2008 and</text>
  <text start="340.139" dur="6.611">this is what happens when the interest</text>
  <text start="343.24" dur="6.78">rate moves up just a little bit can you</text>
  <text start="346.75" dur="8.69">imagine if the interest rate moved up 1</text>
  <text start="350.02" dur="8.82">2 3 4 % it would be a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="355.44" dur="4.659">now there was a little poll about what</text>
  <text start="358.84" dur="3.96">do people care about when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="360.099" dur="5.701">purchasing the house and people are as</text>
  <text start="362.8" dur="6">well is the interest rates well does</text>
  <text start="365.8" dur="7.29">that affect your purchase 68% way rates</text>
  <text start="368.8" dur="5.85">heavily into their purchase decision 72%</text>
  <text start="373.09" dur="6.75">of buyers would have to change your</text>
  <text start="374.65" dur="6.84">strategy on a 1% rate surged 46% of the</text>
  <text start="379.84" dur="5.22">buyers would have to buy a less</text>
  <text start="381.49" dur="6.03">expensive house so you can see how this</text>
  <text start="385.06" dur="3.93">affects the housing industry when the</text>
  <text start="387.52" dur="4.56">interest rates move up a little bit it</text>
  <text start="388.99" dur="6.989">throws millions of people out of the</text>
  <text start="392.08" dur="7.23">market and we are seeing the bubbles pop</text>
  <text start="395.979" dur="4.771">they&amp;#39;re continually popping and what</text>
  <text start="399.31" dur="5.579">we&amp;#39;re doing right now is we&amp;#39;re tracking</text>
  <text start="400.75" dur="8.13">all of this remember we talked about the</text>
  <text start="404.889" dur="7.62">New York housing market out in the</text>
  <text start="408.88" dur="5.58">Hamptons San Francisco well the rental</text>
  <text start="412.509" dur="4.59">market is not any better it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="414.46" dur="5.88">falling apart luxury real estate markets</text>
  <text start="417.099" dur="6.931">in New York in San Francisco well they</text>
  <text start="420.34" dur="6.6">have a supply glut that is getting ready</text>
  <text start="424.03" dur="5.24">to flood the market and there&amp;#39;s just not</text>
  <text start="426.94" dur="5.67">enough people to absorb all of this and</text>
  <text start="429.27" dur="7.269">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now in San</text>
  <text start="432.61" dur="6.77">Francisco the South of Market</text>
  <text start="436.539" dur="7.891">neighborhood there are buildings there</text>

  <text start="469.15" dur="3.69">cities across the country that are about</text>
  <text start="471.49" dur="5.37">to get flooded with new luxury</text>

  <text start="478.06" dur="5.04">apartments are expected to be completed</text>
  <text start="479.71" dur="6.51">across the country or roughly 35 percent</text>
  <text start="483.1" dur="6.09">more than the 20-year average and the</text>
  <text start="486.22" dur="7.83">problem is is that the demand is not</text>
  <text start="489.19" dur="6.48">there there&amp;#39;s too many apartments so we</text>
  <text start="494.05" dur="4.89">see the prices of houses in the Hamptons</text>

  <text start="498.94" dur="6.87">see these apartment buildings they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="502.75" dur="5.97">rent these apartments and this is how it</text>
  <text start="505.81" dur="5.67">begins this is how things start to fall</text>
  <text start="508.72" dur="5.07">apart and if you go outside the 20-city</text>
  <text start="511.48" dur="5.1">case-shiller where they you know use</text>
  <text start="513.79" dur="4.86">these 20 cities to measure how the real</text>
  <text start="516.58" dur="3.99">estate market is doing you see that</text>
  <text start="518.65" dur="5.28">people like they can&amp;#39;t get traffic to</text>
  <text start="520.57" dur="6.57">their homes they can&amp;#39;t get buyers there</text>
  <text start="523.93" dur="5.07">continually lowering their prices and as</text>
  <text start="527.14" dur="4.11">interest rates move up it&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="529" dur="4.56">worse and this then affects let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="531.25" dur="6.8">the lumber industry it affects the</text>
  <text start="533.56" dur="8.01">furniture industry Electrical cement and</text>

  <text start="679.839" dur="3.93">said I don&amp;#39;t want to be involved with</text>
  <text start="681.759" dur="4.11">this but it&amp;#39;s very interesting how all</text>

  <text start="801.57" dur="5.88">start to crumble and fall apart it is</text>

  <text start="813.47" dur="7.27">it&amp;#39;s going to be a bloodbath when this</text>

  <text start="822.48" dur="4.77">guess what the central bankers know this</text>
  <text start="824.58" dur="5.16">they know that this is a ticking time</text>
  <text start="827.25" dur="6.51">bomb and when it goes off its going to</text>
  <text start="829.74" dur="7.65">go off big we see the controversial</text>
  <text start="833.76" dur="8.67">legislation about auditing the Fed well</text>
  <text start="837.39" dur="8.43">it has been reintroduced into Congress</text>
  <text start="842.43" dur="6.09">and we see representative Thomas Massie</text>
  <text start="845.82" dur="6.63">and Senator Rand Paul</text>
  <text start="848.52" dur="6.6">they have reintroduced this and what</text>
  <text start="852.45" dur="5.28">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that they want</text>
  <text start="855.12" dur="5.69">to audit the Fed and we know that Janet</text>
  <text start="857.73" dur="6.03">Yellen she doesn&amp;#39;t want this to happen</text>
  <text start="860.81" dur="5.02">we know that if this bill should ever</text>
  <text start="863.76" dur="4.41">pass Obama would have vetoed it right</text>
  <text start="865.83" dur="4.86">away but now we have a new president</text>
  <text start="868.17" dur="6.78">coming in Donald Trump who talked about</text>
  <text start="870.69" dur="8.7">the Fed and he might move to sign this</text>
  <text start="874.95" dur="7.41">and this is the first step because we</text>
  <text start="879.39" dur="6.39">need to know what this private</text>
  <text start="882.36" dur="6.33">corporation is actually doing but again</text>
  <text start="885.78" dur="5.76">the private corporation doesn&amp;#39;t want you</text>
  <text start="888.69" dur="6.45">to know what they&amp;#39;re doing and before</text>
  <text start="891.54" dur="5.97">this gets any further they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="895.14" dur="6.83">collapse the economy they&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="897.51" dur="9.39">let this get any further they will not</text>
  <text start="901.97" dur="8.71">allow the American people to audit what</text>
  <text start="906.9" dur="6.36">they are doing because if this was</text>
  <text start="910.68" dur="6.63">allowed people would be horrified</text>
  <text start="913.26" dur="7.95">shocked they&amp;#39;d be looking at this saying</text>
  <text start="917.31" dur="7.08">what have they done and at this point</text>
  <text start="921.21" dur="6.3">the Federal Reserve they&amp;#39;re never gonna</text>
  <text start="924.39" dur="6.02">let this happen even with Trump even</text>
  <text start="927.51" dur="6.81">with reintroducing this legislation</text>
  <text start="930.41" dur="6.16">because if this was ever found out what</text>
  <text start="934.32" dur="5.31">they were been doing the Fed would be</text>
  <text start="936.57" dur="6.12">shut down and they know this so today in</text>
  <text start="939.63" dur="7.2">the FOMC minutes Yellen was out there</text>
  <text start="942.69" dur="6.15">and here is another signal that they</text>
  <text start="946.83" dur="5.49">will be bringing this economy down under</text>
  <text start="948.84" dur="7.29">Trump they&amp;#39;re saying that the economy</text>
  <text start="952.32" dur="7.59">looks fantastic very optimistic labor</text>
  <text start="956.13" dur="6.78">market looks incredible and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="959.91" dur="7.2">gonna be raising rates at a faster pace</text>
  <text start="962.91" dur="9">and this tells you right off the bat</text>
  <text start="967.11" dur="8.97">that they are preparing to cripple this</text>
  <text start="971.91" dur="6.45">economy to bring it down during the</text>
  <text start="976.08" dur="4.17">period of Trump this has all been</text>
  <text start="978.36" dur="3.899">planned out they were going to do this</text>
  <text start="980.25" dur="3.509">no matter who was in office but it</text>
  <text start="982.259" dur="3.45">they were gonna change up the plans</text>
  <text start="983.759" dur="3.99">their plan was to blame it on another</text>
  <text start="985.709" dur="3.6">country or group to say that we were</text>
  <text start="987.749" dur="4.2">cyber attacked and that&amp;#39;s why the</text>
  <text start="989.309" dur="5.43">economy came down so they don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="991.949" dur="5.28">blame the person they wanted in the</text>
  <text start="994.739" dur="4.29">White House or the central bank but now</text>
  <text start="997.229" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s a person there that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="999.029" dur="2.941">want they can blame him it&amp;#39;s not a big</text>
  <text start="1001.609" dur="3.42">deal</text>
  <text start="1001.97" dur="6.869">and then as the economy is coming down</text>
  <text start="1005.029" dur="5.79">they can use the cyberattacks and the</text>
  <text start="1008.839" dur="3.81">attack on a financial system from</text>
  <text start="1010.819" dur="5.66">another country in group and they are</text>
  <text start="1012.649" dur="7.25">going to continue with this narrative</text>
  <text start="1016.479" dur="6.85">until they bring down the economy</text>
  <text start="1019.899" dur="5.351">because we&amp;#39;re already seeing the signals</text>
  <text start="1023.329" dur="3.69">from the Fed the first one they raise</text>
  <text start="1025.25" dur="3.12">the rate in December now they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="1027.019" dur="2.52">us it&amp;#39;s gonna be raising it three times</text>

  <text start="1029.539" dur="4.62">process of raising the interest rate</text>
  <text start="1031.189" dur="5.37">once the Dow hits 20,000 points boom</text>
  <text start="1034.159" dur="4.831">this is what they wanted that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1036.559" dur="5.4">signal they reach their goal four point</text>
