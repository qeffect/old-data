  <text start="97.729" dur="4.291">economic collapse financial news well</text>
  <text start="100.07" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s starting to look like retail is</text>
  <text start="102.02" dur="5.64">getting a lot worse than we thought</text>
  <text start="104.42" dur="6.6">where retailers are going to be fighting</text>
  <text start="107.66" dur="5.72">it out on who&amp;#39;s getting the delivery</text>
  <text start="111.02" dur="5.4">trucks who&amp;#39;s getting the customers and</text>
  <text start="113.38" dur="5.08">we see this is already starting to</text>
  <text start="116.42" dur="5">happen the cold war between America&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="118.46" dur="5.91">two largest retailers just turned hot</text>
  <text start="121.42" dur="5.23">walmart is telling trucking companies</text>
  <text start="124.37" dur="5.399">that it will no longer do business with</text>
  <text start="126.65" dur="6.69">them if they continue moving goods for</text>
  <text start="129.769" dur="5.521">Amazon now this is coming out of joy to</text>
  <text start="133.34" dur="4.11">these developments well they&amp;#39;re likely</text>
  <text start="135.29" dur="4.08">to have significant implications for US</text>
  <text start="137.45" dur="4.98">transportation companies because in</text>
  <text start="139.37" dur="4.98">their view Amazon and Walmart remain two</text>
  <text start="142.43" dur="4.38">of the largest users of truckload</text>
  <text start="144.35" dur="4.23">capacity and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if</text>
  <text start="146.81" dur="4.41">this starts to spread to other retailers</text>
  <text start="148.58" dur="4.62">and then all of a sudden spreads down to</text>
  <text start="151.22" dur="3.54">the customer level because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="153.2" dur="3.99">seeing right now is that these companies</text>
  <text start="154.76" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re very desperate because what is</text>
  <text start="157.19" dur="4.5">happening is the discretionary funds</text>
  <text start="159.59" dur="4.53">that the people have the job that the</text>
  <text start="161.69" dur="4.5">people used to have and the high wages</text>
  <text start="164.12" dur="4.589">that people used to be getting that is</text>
  <text start="166.19" dur="5.04">drying up and it&amp;#39;s completely obvious</text>
  <text start="168.709" dur="6.151">because we can see as we look throughout</text>
  <text start="171.23" dur="5.97">time their retail industry continually</text>
  <text start="174.86" dur="4.5">decline decline decline to climb even</text>
  <text start="177.2" dur="4.23">when you look at holiday season and they</text>
  <text start="179.36" dur="4.68">combined online sales to</text>
  <text start="181.43" dur="4.59">brick-and-mortar sales on a holiday</text>
  <text start="184.04" dur="4.29">season sales were</text>
  <text start="186.02" dur="5.61">absolutely terrible actually Black</text>
  <text start="188.33" dur="6.12">Friday Cyber Monday a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="191.63" dur="4.53">now of course they use numbers like ooh</text>
  <text start="194.45" dur="3.99">online sales are up by three billion</text>
  <text start="196.16" dur="4.11">remember this online sales it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="198.44" dur="3.96">been around for a little while so if it</text>
  <text start="200.27" dur="4.86">went from 1 billion to two billion yeah</text>
  <text start="202.4" dur="4.77">that sounds fantastic but the retail</text>
  <text start="205.13" dur="4.98">industry is hundreds and hundreds of</text>
  <text start="207.17" dur="5.52">billions of dollars online sales is just</text>
  <text start="210.11" dur="6.06">about eight to nine percent of the</text>
  <text start="212.69" dur="5.7">overall retail sales and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="216.17" dur="4.41">starting to see is that retailers</text>
  <text start="218.39" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re going to become very very</text>
  <text start="220.58" dur="3.11">desperate as we move throughout this</text>
  <text start="223.1" dur="3.9">year</text>
  <text start="223.69" dur="6.16">now we could see that the student loan</text>
  <text start="227" dur="4.76">debt problem well it&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="229.85" dur="4.59">worse who is it going to get worse for</text>
  <text start="231.76" dur="5.02">those people who are taking out student</text>
  <text start="234.44" dur="5.7">loans because what did they decide to do</text>
  <text start="236.78" dur="7.98">well they&amp;#39;re going to raise the student</text>
  <text start="240.14" dur="8.82">loan rates 15% now beginning on July 1st</text>
  <text start="244.76" dur="6.87">which is Saturday interest rates on new</text>
  <text start="248.96" dur="5.19">student loans will be set higher to four</text>
  <text start="251.63" dur="5.669">point four five percent on a 10-year</text>
  <text start="254.15" dur="5.48">debt from three point seven 6% rate seen</text>
  <text start="257.299" dur="5.071">this year for undergraduates and</text>
  <text start="259.63" dur="6.07">graduate lending rates are also moving</text>
  <text start="262.37" dur="4.74">north to six percent as of July 1st from</text>
  <text start="265.7" dur="4.02">the prior years of five point three one</text>
  <text start="267.11" dur="4.53">percent now if you thought it was</text>
  <text start="269.72" dur="4.5">difficult for these students to pay</text>
  <text start="271.64" dur="4.89">their student loans before well now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="274.22" dur="4.17">going to be even worse actually</text>
  <text start="276.53" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re going to have to modify these</text>
  <text start="278.39" dur="7.08">loans like crazy because as we can see</text>
  <text start="281.63" dur="6.72">the jobs are just not there the job</text>
  <text start="285.47" dur="5.54">numbers are completely manipulated and</text>
  <text start="288.35" dur="4.8">when people are graduating college</text>
  <text start="291.01" dur="3.58">because you know they promise that in</text>
  <text start="293.15" dur="3.57">these high-paying jobs they come out of</text>
  <text start="294.59" dur="4.59">college and they can&amp;#39;t find one guess</text>
  <text start="296.72" dur="4.28">what they can&amp;#39;t pay that tens of</text>
  <text start="299.18" dur="5.04">thousands or hundreds of thousands of</text>
  <text start="301" dur="5.86">these loans back it&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="304.22" dur="4.35">difficult and we know because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="306.86" dur="3.809">looking into this most of these</text>
  <text start="308.57" dur="5.01">individuals are still living with their</text>
  <text start="310.669" dur="4.051">parents they can&amp;#39;t make enough to move</text>
  <text start="313.58" dur="3.51">out on their own</text>
  <text start="314.72" dur="3.6">and to make matters worse and we</text>
  <text start="317.09" dur="2.46">mentioned this in other reports about</text>
  <text start="318.32" dur="4.14">Illinois</text>
  <text start="319.55" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re having major problems here where</text>
  <text start="322.46" dur="4.31">they can&amp;#39;t meet their budgets they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="324.05" dur="6.09">running out of funds and right now</text>
  <text start="326.77" dur="5.17">Powerball well what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="330.14" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re going to suspend it because</text>
  <text start="331.94" dur="7.17">they&amp;#39;re worried about Illinois paying</text>
  <text start="334.61" dur="6.57">out the winnings and this is what is</text>
  <text start="339.11" dur="4.05">happening and Illinois is going down the</text>
  <text start="341.18" dur="4.95">tubes and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="343.16" dur="6.38">Illinois they have about fifteen billion</text>
  <text start="346.13" dur="5.64">dollars in unpaid bills and of course</text>
  <text start="349.54" dur="5.17">these individuals are going to want to</text>
  <text start="351.77" dur="5.16">be paid before Illinois pays out to the</text>
  <text start="354.71" dur="5.01">Powerball winners so it looks like right</text>
  <text start="356.93" dur="4.62">now that Illinois is having major major</text>
  <text start="359.72" dur="4.59">problems actually it&amp;#39;s like the deadbeat</text>
  <text start="361.55" dur="4.89">state of the United States and believe</text>
  <text start="364.31" dur="4.8">me this is not the only state other</text>
  <text start="366.44" dur="5.28">states are going to experience the same</text>
  <text start="369.11" dur="6.48">exact thing when the system starts to</text>
  <text start="371.72" dur="5.67">come down and it accelerates we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="375.59" dur="3.06">to see a lot of states that are going to</text>
  <text start="377.39" dur="3.48">get into trouble look at Puerto Rico</text>
  <text start="378.65" dur="4.74">right now they&amp;#39;re in a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="380.87" dur="5.55">problems and troubles and this is going</text>
  <text start="383.39" dur="5.13">to spread across the country now as we</text>
  <text start="386.42" dur="4.71">can see real estate from it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="388.52" dur="5.1">improving at all we looked at existing</text>
  <text start="391.13" dur="4.89">home sales new home sales and now we see</text>
  <text start="393.62" dur="5.88">pending home sales in May they tumbled</text>
  <text start="396.02" dur="7.43">by 0.8% month on month and they were</text>
  <text start="399.5" dur="7.92">revived even lower for April down-</text>
  <text start="403.45" dur="6.85">1.7 percent this is the third straight</text>
  <text start="407.42" dur="7.23">monthly drop and second annual decline</text>
  <text start="410.3" dur="8.13">in pending home sales now the West saw a</text>
  <text start="414.65" dur="7.86">downturn of about 1.3 percent and we can</text>
  <text start="418.43" dur="7.71">see at this point the index is now 1.7</text>
  <text start="422.51" dur="7.17">percent below a year ago which marks the</text>
  <text start="426.14" dur="6.33">second straight annual decline so again</text>
  <text start="429.68" dur="6.65">this point in time during the spring</text>
  <text start="432.47" dur="6.69">moving into the summer this is the</text>
  <text start="436.33" dur="5.05">fantastic time for real estate this is</text>
  <text start="439.16" dur="4.89">when they&amp;#39;re selling houses like crazy</text>
  <text start="441.38" dur="4.26">the flowers are blowing people want to</text>
  <text start="444.05" dur="5.01">sell their homes they&amp;#39;re trying to sell</text>
  <text start="445.64" dur="6.12">it before kids go to school it&amp;#39;s warm to</text>
  <text start="449.06" dur="3.76">move in and we&amp;#39;re seeing a complete</text>
  <text start="451.76" dur="3.67">disaster happy</text>
  <text start="452.82" dur="5.16">right now total applications mortgage</text>
  <text start="455.43" dur="5.46">applications they fell by 6.2 percent</text>
  <text start="457.98" dur="5.57">last week compared to the previous week</text>
  <text start="460.89" dur="5.91">now the Mortgage Bankers Association</text>
  <text start="463.55" dur="6.36">adjusted index is now down 17 percent</text>
  <text start="466.8" dur="5.94">compared to the same week one year ago</text>
  <text start="469.91" dur="5.8">refinancing applications they are down</text>
  <text start="472.74" dur="5.34">9% and when you really look at this</text>
  <text start="475.71" dur="4.71">entire situation we can see that pending</text>
  <text start="478.08" dur="4.62">home sales they&amp;#39;ve really gone nowhere</text>
  <text start="480.42" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;ve been bouncing around but they</text>
  <text start="482.7" dur="4.71">haven&amp;#39;t been moving up they have they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="484.47" dur="5.04">been like flatlined because this is part</text>
  <text start="487.41" dur="4.53">of the illusion this is part of the</text>
  <text start="489.51" dur="4.41">manipulation if we took away and</text>
  <text start="491.94" dur="4.95">stripped away this manipulation the</text>
  <text start="493.92" dur="6.27">housing market is dead if we took away</text>
  <text start="496.89" dur="4.83">all the manipulation in these 20 cities</text>
  <text start="500.19" dur="3.99">where they pumped up the bubbles the</text>
  <text start="501.72" dur="6.21">housing market is completely dead the</text>
  <text start="504.18" dur="5.46">values of all these homes they would</text>
  <text start="507.93" dur="6.109">completely drop off the face of the</text>
  <text start="509.64" dur="7.709">earth that&amp;#39;s how bad it is now Trump</text>
  <text start="514.039" dur="5.681">realizes how bad the system is he said</text>
  <text start="517.349" dur="4.201">it before he was even elected president</text>
  <text start="519.72" dur="3.24">he said we&amp;#39;re looking at bubbles all</text>
  <text start="521.55" dur="2.52">over the place when he was elected</text>
  <text start="522.96" dur="3.63">president he said the economy is a</text>
  <text start="524.07" dur="5.04">complete mess and what he&amp;#39;s doing what</text>
  <text start="526.59" dur="5.1">he&amp;#39;s trying to do is he&amp;#39;s trying to cut</text>
  <text start="529.11" dur="5.13">the budget any way he possibly can now</text>
  <text start="531.69" dur="5.85">this is a very difficult thing to do</text>
  <text start="534.24" dur="6.35">because those who are in government in</text>
  <text start="537.54" dur="5.1">Congress who are controlled by the</text>
  <text start="540.59" dur="4.45">corporations controlled by the central</text>
  <text start="542.64" dur="4.8">bank they&amp;#39;ve been there for a very long</text>
  <text start="545.04" dur="5.97">time they don&amp;#39;t like cuts they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="547.44" dur="6.42">like anything that basically takes away</text>
  <text start="551.01" dur="7.91">from them and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="553.86" dur="8.43">now is they&amp;#39;re ready to cut spending and</text>
  <text start="558.92" dur="4.93">impose a hiring freeze in government</text>
  <text start="562.29" dur="3.75">this is something that is needed and</text>
  <text start="563.85" dur="4.64">it&amp;#39;s very difficult to people understand</text>
  <text start="566.04" dur="4.68">because when the system runs out of</text>
  <text start="568.49" dur="4.24">currency where they can&amp;#39;t pay for</text>
  <text start="570.72" dur="4.8">anything and the tax receipts aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="572.73" dur="4.8">coming in you need to make cuts now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="575.52" dur="5.19">not a very popular thing think about</text>
  <text start="577.53" dur="5.94">your own household where you have income</text>
  <text start="580.71" dur="5.25">coming in you have your expenses and</text>
  <text start="583.47" dur="5.43">your income</text>
  <text start="585.96" dur="5.1">is dropped in half what do you have to</text>
  <text start="588.9" dur="4.11">do or you lose your job and you get a</text>
  <text start="591.06" dur="4.71">part-time job or two part-time jobs and</text>
  <text start="593.01" dur="5.51">you can&amp;#39;t make ends meet you need to cut</text>
  <text start="595.77" dur="4.95">things out now the people in your family</text>
  <text start="598.52" dur="4.15">you&amp;#39;re not really that popular anymore</text>
  <text start="600.72" dur="4.7">because you got to get rid of Netflix</text>
  <text start="602.67" dur="6.84">maybe you have to get rid of one car</text>
  <text start="605.42" dur="6.81">maybe you have to get rid of cable</text>
  <text start="609.51" dur="5.85">television or something like that and</text>
  <text start="612.23" dur="5.14">people you know this is very difficult</text>
  <text start="615.36" dur="3.57">to do it&amp;#39;s very difficult to do in</text>
  <text start="617.37" dur="3.09">government especially when you have all</text>
  <text start="618.93" dur="3.36">these people who&amp;#39;ve been in the</text>
  <text start="620.46" dur="3.57">government for a very long time who</text>
  <text start="622.29" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t like to see guts they want to</text>
  <text start="624.03" dur="3.3">spend more this is what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="625.65" dur="4.86">doing over a very long period of time</text>
  <text start="627.33" dur="7.67">but we&amp;#39;re entering this period where</text>
  <text start="630.51" dur="8.19">certain things need to change for this</text>
  <text start="635" dur="7.06">entire reset that is about to happen and</text>
  <text start="638.7" dur="6.11">we just got the confirmation from the</text>
  <text start="642.06" dur="3.93">Federal Reserve that things are about to</text>
  <text start="644.81" dur="4.39">change</text>
  <text start="645.99" dur="6.03">now if there was any confusion why the</text>
  <text start="649.2" dur="5.37">Fed intends to keep hiking rates even in</text>
  <text start="652.02" dur="3.9">the face of negative economic data and</text>
  <text start="654.57" dur="5.55">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all this data and</text>
  <text start="655.92" dur="6.9">it is absolutely awful it was put to</text>
  <text start="660.12" dur="7.73">rest over the past two days when not one</text>
  <text start="662.82" dur="7.47">not two not three but four fed speakers</text>
  <text start="667.85" dur="5.17">including the three most important ones</text>
  <text start="670.29" dur="5.55">made it clear that the feds only</text>
  <text start="673.02" dur="4.5">intention at this point is to burst the</text>

  <text start="689.37" dur="4.59">running very much on fumes</text>
  <text start="691.35" dur="5.61">then it was fed vice chairman Stan</text>

  <text start="725.13" dur="4.16">was out there and she said something</text>
  <text start="727.77" dur="5.76">very interesting</text>
  <text start="729.29" dur="7.93">she said that financial institutions are</text>
  <text start="733.53" dur="6.54">much safer and sounder she said well I</text>

  <text start="740.07" dur="6.33">financial crisis no probably that would</text>
  <text start="743.37" dur="6.15">be going too far but I do think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="746.4" dur="6.21">much safer and I hope that it will not</text>
  <text start="749.52" dur="6.72">be in our lifetime and I don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="752.61" dur="7.73">it will now let&amp;#39;s think back for a</text>

  <text start="760.34" dur="7.65">told us that the Fed is not forecasting</text>

  <text start="776.64" dur="5.58">just completely crashed and that</text>
  <text start="779.22" dur="5.43">followed into 2009 and this was the</text>
  <text start="782.22" dur="5.76">worst crash that many of us has ever</text>
  <text start="784.65" dur="6.84">seen now we have Janet Yellen out there</text>
  <text start="787.98" dur="4.74">who is telling us that she doesn&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="791.49" dur="6.69">there&amp;#39;s going to be any type of</text>
  <text start="792.72" dur="9.9">financial crisis in our lifetime really</text>
  <text start="798.18" dur="8.13">if you notice they always seem to tell</text>
  <text start="802.62" dur="6.84">us these things right before there is a</text>

  <text start="809.46" dur="5.76">everyone know that something is</text>
  <text start="811.65" dur="8.34">something bad is about to happen because</text>

  <text start="819.99" dur="4.97">going to see anything in our lifetime I</text>
  <text start="822.06" dur="5.91">mean think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="824.96" dur="4.42">yes can they keep the stock market up</text>
  <text start="827.97" dur="3.66">yeah they can keep pushing the button</text>

  <text start="838.98" dur="5.52">stamps the majority of people are on</text>
  <text start="841.32" dur="5.94">government programs if the majority of</text>
  <text start="844.5" dur="6.57">the people can&amp;#39;t find jobs if retail</text>

  <text start="853.139" dur="8.64">mm that&amp;#39;s an economic collapse so they</text>
