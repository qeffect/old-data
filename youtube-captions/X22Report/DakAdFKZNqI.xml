  <text start="53.24" dur="4.92">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="56.72" dur="5.25">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.16" dur="6.53">episode 1611 a and today&amp;#39;s date is July</text>
  <text start="61.97" dur="6.15">9 2018 and the thought of the episode is</text>
  <text start="64.69" dur="6.34">warning the wave of inflation is about</text>
  <text start="68.12" dur="4.98">to hit let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="71.03" dur="5.58">collapse financial news now we</text>
  <text start="73.1" dur="6.06">understand since the vote for brexit the</text>
  <text start="76.61" dur="5.67">central bankers well they&amp;#39;re gonna do</text>
  <text start="79.16" dur="6.3">whatever they possibly can to keep the</text>
  <text start="82.28" dur="5.58">UK in their system they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="85.46" dur="5.07">anyone to leave and they will do</text>
  <text start="87.86" dur="6.36">whatever it takes to keep these</text>
  <text start="90.53" dur="6.35">countries in their system and we can see</text>
  <text start="94.22" dur="5.7">that things are not going well in the UK</text>
  <text start="96.88" dur="3.7">brexit secretary David Davis he has</text>
  <text start="99.92" dur="3.6">resigned</text>
  <text start="100.58" dur="4.92">and what he cited was exceptional</text>
  <text start="103.52" dur="5.01">weakness of Prime Minister teresa&amp;#39;s Mays</text>
  <text start="105.5" dur="6.15">wish for soft exit that ties the UK to</text>
  <text start="108.53" dur="6.48">the EU and what he went on to say is</text>
  <text start="111.65" dur="5.91">that it would not be plausible for him</text>
  <text start="115.01" dur="5.37">to carry on spearheading brexit</text>
  <text start="117.56" dur="5.49">negotiations giving his public concerns</text>
  <text start="120.38" dur="5.19">about Mays policy he said in my view</text>
  <text start="123.05" dur="5.28">this policy has got a number of</text>
  <text start="125.57" dur="4.77">weaknesses I would be front and center</text>
  <text start="128.33" dur="5.01">in delivering this policy explaining it</text>
  <text start="130.34" dur="5.31">to the house persuading the house it is</text>
  <text start="133.34" dur="5.46">right and then going out and delivering</text>
  <text start="135.65" dur="6.15">it with the EU but he&amp;#39;s saying that he</text>
  <text start="138.8" dur="6.12">doesn&amp;#39;t believe in it so what is</text>
  <text start="141.8" dur="6.74">happening here is that the central</text>
  <text start="144.92" dur="8.28">banking establishment they are trying to</text>
  <text start="148.54" dur="6.07">push the UK into what they want now on</text>
  <text start="153.2" dur="4.68">July 6</text>
  <text start="154.61" dur="5.85">the British government held a cabinet</text>
  <text start="157.88" dur="5.46">meeting at Chequers following the</text>
  <text start="160.46" dur="5.25">meeting it published a paper that took a</text>
  <text start="163.34" dur="5.16">weird position towards exiting the</text>
  <text start="165.71" dur="5.76">European Union if it would be followed</text>
  <text start="168.5" dur="5.37">Britain would practically end up with</text>
  <text start="171.47" dur="5.43">staying in the EU accepting nearly all</text>
  <text start="173.87" dur="6.12">its regulations and Court decisions but</text>
  <text start="176.9" dur="6.15">without any say over what the EU decides</text>
  <text start="179.99" dur="6.93">the paper was clearly written by the</text>
  <text start="183.05" dur="6.799">remain side the two top predators in</text>
  <text start="186.92" dur="6.09">a cabinet felt cheated and then resigned</text>
  <text start="189.849" dur="6.22">most most likely we&amp;#39;re gonna see more</text>
  <text start="193.01" dur="5.94">people resign and we have we see Boris</text>
  <text start="196.069" dur="4.741">Johnson he is also resigned today the</text>
  <text start="198.95" dur="5.19">majority of the British people who voted</text>
  <text start="200.81" dur="7.38">to leave the EU they probably feel duped</text>
  <text start="204.14" dur="6.42">and it reminds me of Greece when the</text>
  <text start="208.19" dur="4.04">Greek people hired tsipras to go up</text>
  <text start="210.56" dur="6.3">against the central banking system and</text>
  <text start="212.23" dur="7.509">tsipras kind of folded now it seems that</text>
  <text start="216.86" dur="4.68">Prime Minister Theresa May was tasked</text>
  <text start="219.739" dur="5.071">with running out the clock in</text>
  <text start="221.54" dur="6.33">negotiations with the EU and then right</text>
  <text start="224.81" dur="5.94">after the March 2019 date of this</text>
  <text start="227.87" dur="4.89">supposedly hard brexit well it looks</text>
  <text start="230.75" dur="4.5">like there&amp;#39;d be no agreement with the EU</text>
  <text start="232.76" dur="4.559">whatsoever the powers that would be</text>
  <text start="235.25" dur="3.93">launched a panic campaign to push the</text>
  <text start="237.319" dur="3.48">population into a new vote the vote</text>
  <text start="239.18" dur="3.66">would end with a victory for the</text>
  <text start="240.799" dur="4.801">remaining side the UK would continue to</text>
  <text start="242.84" dur="5.22">be a member of the European Union and it</text>
  <text start="245.6" dur="4.35">looks like this was their plan and this</text>
  <text start="248.06" dur="4.53">is where they&amp;#39;re headed because at this</text>
  <text start="249.95" dur="5.909">point it seems like the UK is not</text>
  <text start="252.59" dur="7.11">leaving the EU right now not the way</text>
  <text start="255.859" dur="5.85">that people believe they should and we</text>
  <text start="259.7" dur="4.89">see that things are completely falling</text>
  <text start="261.709" dur="5.041">apart out in the UK now something</text>
  <text start="264.59" dur="4.74">strange has happened here in the US and</text>
  <text start="266.75" dur="6.66">out in China we know that Trump has been</text>
  <text start="269.33" dur="6.44">pushing tariffs breaking up NAFTA trying</text>
  <text start="273.41" dur="6.84">to break up the World Trade Organization</text>
  <text start="275.77" dur="6.97">got rid of TPP and we know and which I</text>
  <text start="280.25" dur="4.169">do believe that Trump behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="282.74" dur="4.47">is working with Xi Jinping working with</text>
  <text start="284.419" dur="6.681">Putin to push out the central banking</text>
  <text start="287.21" dur="9.59">system what&amp;#39;s very odd is that Trump is</text>
  <text start="291.1" dur="12.52">continually pushing tariffs on China</text>
  <text start="296.8" dur="9.31">penalties on China and Xi Jinping has</text>
  <text start="303.62" dur="7.32">directed the state media to watch how</text>
  <text start="306.11" dur="7.47">they report on President Trump they</text>
  <text start="310.94" dur="5.219">wanted to say that they should not use</text>
  <text start="313.58" dur="5.579">aggressive language for Trump and the</text>
  <text start="316.159" dur="4.261">edict called on media outlets not to</text>
  <text start="319.159" dur="4.111">make vulgar at</text>
  <text start="320.42" dur="6.51">on Trump to avoid making this war of</text>
  <text start="323.27" dur="5.61">insults similar to angry back and forth</text>
  <text start="326.93" dur="5.7">between Trump and North Korea&amp;#39;s leader</text>
  <text start="328.88" dur="5.85">Kim jong-un last summer and this is kind</text>
  <text start="332.63" dur="3.45">of strange because Trump is out there</text>
  <text start="334.73" dur="4.5">saying that yes we&amp;#39;re placing these</text>
  <text start="336.08" dur="5.43">tariffs and pushing this agenda and you</text>
  <text start="339.23" dur="4.59">would think that China would be on the</text>
  <text start="341.51" dur="4.59">other side pushing back but we&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="343.82" dur="4.08">not seeing this yes they&amp;#39;re pushing a</text>
  <text start="346.1" dur="6.35">little bit but I think what is happening</text>
  <text start="347.9" dur="7.65">here this entire plan right now is to</text>
  <text start="352.45" dur="6.46">really push this onto the central</text>
  <text start="355.55" dur="5.19">banking system and to have them make</text>
  <text start="358.91" dur="3.6">their move and I think this is the plan</text>
  <text start="360.74" dur="3.03">that they&amp;#39;re working on right now and</text>
  <text start="362.51" dur="3.78">this is why we&amp;#39;ve been seeing the</text>
  <text start="363.77" dur="6.51">central bank come out and say you know</text>
  <text start="366.29" dur="6.45">we&amp;#39;re gonna get rid of the Fred graph</text>
  <text start="370.28" dur="4.59">which shows our balance sheet</text>
  <text start="372.74" dur="5.82">normalization the yield curve is</text>
  <text start="374.87" dur="5.4">meaningless it&amp;#39;s distorted and we see</text>
  <text start="378.56" dur="3.75">them doing many other things where the</text>
  <text start="380.27" dur="4.2">mainstream media is out there already</text>
  <text start="382.31" dur="4.29">calling for a recession the Fed is</text>
  <text start="384.47" dur="4.95">already blaming the next economic</text>
  <text start="386.6" dur="5.07">collapse on Trump because of his tariffs</text>
  <text start="389.42" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s going to wreck the economy and I</text>
  <text start="391.67" dur="5.43">think all of this is being done to push</text>
  <text start="394.25" dur="5.45">the central bank in this direction to</text>
  <text start="397.1" dur="5.01">met to make them make their move and</text>
  <text start="399.7" dur="5.65">again everything that we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="402.11" dur="5.46">not always what is happening just</text>
  <text start="405.35" dur="4.47">because you see tariffs and you see</text>
  <text start="407.57" dur="4.11">trade disputes and you see things it</text>
  <text start="409.82" dur="4.59">doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s going to lead to a war</text>
  <text start="411.68" dur="6.15">it means that they&amp;#39;re playing out a</text>
  <text start="414.41" dur="6.86">strategy to push different organizations</text>
  <text start="417.83" dur="6.99">into different areas and to make deals</text>
  <text start="421.27" dur="5.92">to protect the United States in the long</text>
  <text start="424.82" dur="3.93">run and I think this is why all these</text>
  <text start="427.19" dur="3.29">bilateral trade agreements are being</text>
  <text start="428.75" dur="5.22">made because I think in the long run</text>
  <text start="430.48" dur="6.31">they know and we know that this central</text>
  <text start="433.97" dur="5.37">banking system that were in today it</text>
  <text start="436.79" dur="4.14">cannot survive much longer yes they can</text>
  <text start="439.34" dur="3.93">start lowering interest rates that can</text>
  <text start="440.93" dur="4.65">raise interest rates they can create</text>
  <text start="443.27" dur="4.62">more currency but what is this economy</text>
  <text start="445.58" dur="3.96">going to look like if they continually</text>
  <text start="447.89" dur="2.82">do this it&amp;#39;s just going to get worse and</text>
  <text start="449.54" dur="3.54">worse and worse and eventually what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="450.71" dur="3.51">going to happen is that people are going</text>
  <text start="453.08" dur="2.79">to be losing jobs</text>
  <text start="454.22" dur="4.11">again we know the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="455.87" dur="4.44">are not real and before you know it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.33" dur="3.6">gonna really show up in the tax receipts</text>
  <text start="460.31" dur="3.84">that the government is receiving and as</text>
  <text start="461.93" dur="4.53">the government continually adds on more</text>
  <text start="464.15" dur="4.89">debt and there&amp;#39;s less tax receipts</text>
  <text start="466.46" dur="5.13">coming in what do you see happening here</text>
  <text start="469.04" dur="4.62">you see that the payments cannot be made</text>
  <text start="471.59" dur="4.23">on the debt this is what we see</text>
  <text start="473.66" dur="4.17">happening out in other countries the</text>
  <text start="475.82" dur="3.66">only difference is here in the United</text>
  <text start="477.83" dur="3.78">States there&amp;#39;s a printing press well</text>
  <text start="479.48" dur="4.17">they just push a button today but</text>
  <text start="481.61" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re able to use the credit card and</text>
  <text start="483.65" dur="5.55">continually swipe it and you add on more</text>
  <text start="487.58" dur="3.99">and more debt now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="489.2" dur="3.69">interesting to add on top of all this</text>
  <text start="491.57" dur="3.57">and we know the Fed has been doing a lot</text>
  <text start="492.89" dur="4.89">of strange things and hiding a lot of</text>
  <text start="495.14" dur="4.5">data they manipulated the stress test we</text>
  <text start="497.78" dur="4.62">know the banks are completely insolvent</text>
  <text start="499.64" dur="5.3">but what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that New</text>
  <text start="502.4" dur="5.61">York Fed joined the Atlanta Fed in</text>
  <text start="504.94" dur="8.409">releasing its own measure to track</text>
  <text start="508.01" dur="7.68">underlying inflation now they&amp;#39;re calling</text>
  <text start="513.349" dur="3.841">it the underlying inflation gauge now</text>
  <text start="515.69" dur="2.94">remember the Fed is continually out</text>
  <text start="517.19" dur="3.12">there saying that they don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="518.63" dur="3.659">inflation anywhere where is it we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="520.31" dur="4.53">know where it is it&amp;#39;s not happening but</text>
  <text start="522.289" dur="5.131">again everyday people that are doing</text>
  <text start="524.84" dur="5.7">everyday things like buying food filling</text>
  <text start="527.42" dur="5.49">up their gas tank trying to purchase a</text>
  <text start="530.54" dur="6.09">house maybe sending their child to</text>
  <text start="532.91" dur="6.15">college they see the inflation dealing</text>
  <text start="536.63" dur="6.33">with medical costs they see all the</text>
  <text start="539.06" dur="6.57">inflation everywhere so what&amp;#39;s notable</text>
  <text start="542.96" dur="5.82">is that this latest inflation tracker</text>
  <text start="545.63" dur="7.19">shows prices behaving behaving quite</text>
  <text start="548.78" dur="7.91">differently from the traditional indexes</text>
  <text start="552.82" dur="7.84">according to the UI G&amp;#39;s August measure</text>
  <text start="556.69" dur="9.13">broad inflation came in at a red-hot 3.2</text>
  <text start="560.66" dur="7.65">7% the highest since September 2005 that</text>
  <text start="565.82" dur="3.66">compares with just 2.8 percent annual</text>
  <text start="568.31" dur="4.44">inflation according to the Labor</text>
  <text start="569.48" dur="6.21">Department CPI and even more modest 2.0</text>
  <text start="572.75" dur="7.71">is measured by the preferred PCE gauge</text>
  <text start="575.69" dur="7.19">of the Fed policymakers now there is a</text>
  <text start="580.46" dur="5.94">warning out there from this new gauge</text>
  <text start="582.88" dur="4.99">the warning is is that inflation is</text>
  <text start="586.4" dur="5.01">coming the new gauge</text>
  <text start="587.87" dur="6.33">shows that a spike of inflation is going</text>
  <text start="591.41" dur="5.91">to hit in the next couple of months from</text>
  <text start="594.2" dur="6.9">its current level it&amp;#39;s set to rise as</text>
  <text start="597.32" dur="6.33">high as 2.8 percent matching the highest</text>
  <text start="601.1" dur="4.8">since 2006 when the Fed Funds rate was</text>
  <text start="603.65" dur="4.2">around five percent and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="605.9" dur="6.63">saying is it&amp;#39;s just going to continually</text>
  <text start="607.85" dur="7.23">move higher and higher now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="612.53" dur="4.86">talking about how this wave is going to</text>
  <text start="615.08" dur="5.61">come in now we talked about like a</text>
  <text start="617.39" dur="5.55">tsunami wave where the water recedes and</text>
  <text start="620.69" dur="4.44">it looks like Oh nothing&amp;#39;s happening and</text>
  <text start="622.94" dur="4.02">the water is receding and then all of a</text>
  <text start="625.13" dur="2.91">sudden the wave builds and it builds and</text>
  <text start="626.96" dur="3.39">it builds and all of sudden comes</text>
  <text start="628.04" dur="4.56">crashing down and it seems like when we</text>
  <text start="630.35" dur="4.56">look at this that this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="632.6" dur="4.62">is happening we&amp;#39;ve had you know no</text>
  <text start="634.91" dur="5.19">inflation that you can really talk about</text>
  <text start="637.22" dur="6.03">yes you see it in in food prices and</text>
  <text start="640.1" dur="4.8">other things but the real inflation when</text>
  <text start="643.25" dur="2.79">it really really hits I&amp;#39;m not talking</text>
  <text start="644.9" dur="3.48">about every day we&amp;#39;re inflation I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="646.04" dur="4.71">talking about hyperinflation when that</text>
  <text start="648.38" dur="6.56">hits it&amp;#39;s going to be like a tidal wave</text>
  <text start="650.75" dur="6.3">and the Fed they are going to be stuck</text>
  <text start="654.94" dur="3.97">because right now they&amp;#39;re raising</text>
  <text start="657.05" dur="3.6">interest rates what are they gonna do</text>
  <text start="658.91" dur="4.83">when inflation has think about in the</text>
  <text start="660.65" dur="4.5">1970s when we were seeing inflation they</text>
  <text start="663.74" dur="4.61">were able to raise the interest rates</text>
  <text start="665.15" dur="5.52">quite a bit to counter the inflation</text>
  <text start="668.35" dur="4.48">because people salaries were going up</text>
  <text start="670.67" dur="3.78">home prices were going everything was</text>
  <text start="672.83" dur="2.91">going up because why they were creating</text>
  <text start="674.45" dur="3.24">a lot of currency and they realized they</text>
  <text start="675.74" dur="3.57">were able to bring the interest rates up</text>
  <text start="677.69" dur="3">very very high what are they gonna do</text>
  <text start="679.31" dur="4.32">this time because if they bring up the</text>
  <text start="680.69" dur="5.55">interest rates and they try to combat</text>
  <text start="683.63" dur="5.31">this inflation as it takes off and they</text>
  <text start="686.24" dur="5.34">can&amp;#39;t control it anymore what happens to</text>
  <text start="688.94" dur="3.81">servicing the debt what happens to the</text>
  <text start="691.58" dur="3.99">corporate debt how is that going to be</text>
  <text start="692.75" dur="4.79">serviced how about the people how are</text>
  <text start="695.57" dur="4.08">they going to service their own debt</text>
  <text start="697.54" dur="4.45">because you know the payments on the</text>

  <text start="883.15" dur="5.94">economy buckle this is what happens</text>
  <text start="886.48" dur="3.87">we&amp;#39;re at the end stage this is not when</text>
  <text start="889.09" dur="2.61">we&amp;#39;re just in the beginning stages of</text>
