  <text start="64.01" dur="5.97">episode is the crackdown continues these</text>
  <text start="66.68" dur="5.07">individuals need to be investigated now</text>
  <text start="69.98" dur="3.87">before I get started I just want to make</text>
  <text start="71.75" dur="5.4">an announcement I uploaded an interview</text>
  <text start="73.85" dur="5.43">with Lynette Zhang on Saturday it is on</text>

  <text start="88.49" dur="3.57">news sentinel comm site just scroll down</text>
  <text start="90.68" dur="3.78">a little bit look over the right-hand</text>

  <text start="97.729" dur="6.571">video there and this is a must watch</text>
  <text start="100.43" dur="5.67">video of Lynette she breaks it down on</text>
  <text start="104.3" dur="4.41">what&amp;#39;s going to happen to pension</text>
  <text start="106.1" dur="5.37">savings she compares it to what happened</text>
  <text start="108.71" dur="4.86">when Russia collapsed and this I believe</text>
  <text start="111.47" dur="5.55">is one of those things that you need to</text>
  <text start="113.57" dur="7.26">listen to to understand what the central</text>
  <text start="117.02" dur="6.12">bank&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re planning to do let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="120.83" dur="4.92">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="123.14" dur="4.979">and geopolitical news now we understand</text>
  <text start="125.75" dur="3.78">that the vote for the healthcare bills</text>
  <text start="128.119" dur="3.901">coming up but it looks like John McCain</text>
  <text start="129.53" dur="5.45">it looks like he had some type of</text>
  <text start="132.02" dur="6.93">surgery so it is postponed right now and</text>
  <text start="134.98" dur="5.979">one thing that we realize is that this</text>
  <text start="138.95" dur="4.35">is just a rewrite of Obamacare and they</text>
  <text start="140.959" dur="5.161">change couple things around and it looks</text>
  <text start="143.3" dur="4.53">like they are helping the insurance</text>
  <text start="146.12" dur="3.87">industry a lot more than they&amp;#39;re helping</text>
  <text start="147.83" dur="4.23">the people but Rand Paul is out there</text>
  <text start="149.99" dur="4.86">and he&amp;#39;s going to introduce a pro-gun</text>
  <text start="152.06" dur="4.29">amendment to the health care bill</text>
  <text start="154.85" dur="3.99">because we need to remember remember</text>
  <text start="156.35" dur="4.68">Obamacare they wanted information about</text>
  <text start="158.84" dur="3.9">do you own a weapon they wanted to feed</text>
  <text start="161.03" dur="4.23">it into a database so what he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="162.74" dur="4.98">do he&amp;#39;s going to make sure that insurers</text>
  <text start="165.26" dur="4.38">cannot ask about gun ownership or feed</text>
  <text start="167.72" dur="4.83">that information into federal databases</text>
  <text start="169.64" dur="5.79">or discriminate or deny insurance to gun</text>
  <text start="172.55" dur="5.159">owners he&amp;#39;s also going to create a</text>
  <text start="175.43" dur="4.11">federal mandate that doctors keep</text>
  <text start="177.709" dur="5.191">digital records in a federal health</text>
  <text start="179.54" dur="5.15">database cannot be used to force doctors</text>
  <text start="182.9" dur="5.06">to compile a federal health</text>
  <text start="184.69" dur="6.51">database the ATF must not be allowed to</text>
  <text start="187.96" dur="6.48">troll the federal health database for</text>
  <text start="191.2" dur="6.81">names that it could submit to the NI CS</text>
  <text start="194.44" dur="6">list so he is doing all of this to make</text>
  <text start="198.01" dur="4.71">sure that none of this is in there now</text>
  <text start="200.44" dur="4.92">who knows what&amp;#39;s going to happen to this</text>
  <text start="202.72" dur="4.8">health care bill again it&amp;#39;s really a big</text>
  <text start="205.36" dur="4.14">gigantic rewrite with patches here and</text>
  <text start="207.52" dur="4.2">there and it looks like it&amp;#39;s helping the</text>
  <text start="209.5" dur="5.58">insurance companies and other entities</text>
  <text start="211.72" dur="4.35">and we could see right now that nothing</text>
  <text start="215.08" dur="3.06">has changed</text>
  <text start="216.07" dur="6.05">this is not being done for the people</text>
  <text start="218.14" dur="6.66">once again it is being done for the</text>
  <text start="222.12" dur="5.44">insurance companies it&amp;#39;s being done for</text>
  <text start="224.8" dur="5.52">certain entities other corporations to</text>
  <text start="227.56" dur="3.93">bring in taxes so we&amp;#39;ll have to wait to</text>
  <text start="230.32" dur="3.48">see how this goes</text>
  <text start="231.49" dur="4.41">because right now nothing can be done</text>
  <text start="233.8" dur="4.65">because McCain is out for some type of</text>
  <text start="235.9" dur="4.74">surgery or something like that now we</text>
  <text start="238.45" dur="4.68">understand that the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="240.64" dur="5.1">making a really big deal about this</text>
  <text start="243.13" dur="5.07">Russian collusion and I wanted to take</text>
  <text start="245.74" dur="6.87">what they&amp;#39;ve been saying and their logic</text>
  <text start="248.2" dur="8.07">and apply this to other individuals that</text>
  <text start="252.61" dur="6.33">we should be investigating now remember</text>
  <text start="256.27" dur="4.5">incoming FBI director Christopher reg he</text>
  <text start="258.94" dur="3.99">has stated that he would be interested</text>
  <text start="260.77" dur="4.649">in investigating links between officials</text>
  <text start="262.93" dur="5.16">of the Ukrainian regime and the Hillary</text>
  <text start="265.419" dur="5.281">Clinton campaign now there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="268.09" dur="6.329">evidence that is mounting that shows</text>
  <text start="270.7" dur="6.18">that officials in Kiev actively work</text>
  <text start="274.419" dur="6.091">with the Clinton campaign to you know</text>
  <text start="276.88" dur="6.72">try to influence the u.s. voters and if</text>
  <text start="280.51" dur="6.659">we take what is happening with Trump and</text>
  <text start="283.6" dur="7.17">Russia and we apply the same logic to</text>
  <text start="287.169" dur="6.631">Clinton and Ukraine well let&amp;#39;s think</text>
  <text start="290.77" dur="5.13">about this for a second because one of</text>
  <text start="293.8" dur="3.96">the most fascinating aspects of the</text>
  <text start="295.9" dur="6">so-called Russia Gate investigation is</text>
  <text start="297.76" dur="6">that anyone connected to say Trump who</text>
  <text start="301.9" dur="5.87">ever had a conversation with a Russian</text>
  <text start="303.76" dur="8.22">well they&amp;#39;re involved in this whole</text>
  <text start="307.77" dur="8.08">Russian gate type of scenario and is a</text>
  <text start="311.98" dur="6.22">person of interest to an investigator so</text>
  <text start="315.85" dur="6.25">let&amp;#39;s take the same logic and apply</text>
  <text start="318.2" dur="5.88">to Ukraine and Clinton because we do</text>
  <text start="322.1" dur="5.61">have evidence that is continually</text>
  <text start="324.08" dur="6.66">mounting right now now if we take the</text>
  <text start="327.71" dur="6.21">same tactics and we apply it</text>
  <text start="330.74" dur="6.11">well then hunter Biden you should be</text>
  <text start="333.92" dur="5.76">investigated he&amp;#39;s the youngest son of</text>
  <text start="336.85" dur="5.2">Joe Biden device the former vice</text>
  <text start="339.68" dur="6.93">president now remember there was a coup</text>
  <text start="342.05" dur="7.35">d&amp;#39;etat in Ukraine and right after the</text>
  <text start="346.61" dur="7.47">coup d&amp;#39;etat what happened well hunter</text>
  <text start="349.4" dur="8.52">Biden he was put on the board of one of</text>
  <text start="354.08" dur="7.14">the biggest gas companies in Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="357.92" dur="5.61">this just happened weeks later I mean is</text>
  <text start="361.22" dur="3.57">this a coincidence I mean think about</text>
  <text start="363.53" dur="3.33">this for a second how could this</text>
  <text start="364.79" dur="5.79">possibly happen so let&amp;#39;s look at Joe</text>
  <text start="366.86" dur="6.6">Biden because Joe Biden he was there in</text>
  <text start="370.58" dur="6.57">Ukraine he gave a anti Russian Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="373.46" dur="6.69">gas speech and his son then was</text>
  <text start="377.15" dur="6.63">appointed weeks later to the board of a</text>
  <text start="380.15" dur="6.6">major Ukrainian energy company and it</text>
  <text start="383.78" dur="7.22">shows that punter Joe Biden all</text>
  <text start="386.75" dur="8.64">connected to Ukraine let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="391" dur="7.56">Alexandra Chu lupa for over ten years</text>
  <text start="395.39" dur="6.57">chalupa a US citizen of ukranian origin</text>
  <text start="398.56" dur="5.23">work for the Democratic Party it has</text>
  <text start="401.96" dur="4.59">been established that she had multiple</text>
  <text start="403.79" dur="5.76">meetings at Ukrainian Embassy in</text>
  <text start="406.55" dur="4.86">Washington DC in order to dig up dirt on</text>
  <text start="409.55" dur="4.38">former Trump campaign worker Paul</text>
  <text start="411.41" dur="5.79">Manafort so she has a connection to</text>
  <text start="413.93" dur="5.76">Ukraine and to Paul Manafort and she was</text>
  <text start="417.2" dur="6.72">digging up information so she should be</text>
  <text start="419.69" dur="8.43">investigated John McCain now we know</text>
  <text start="423.92" dur="8.34">McCain he was out in Ukraine he has ties</text>
  <text start="428.12" dur="8.52">to Ukrainian leaders he was shown in</text>
  <text start="432.26" dur="7.56">pictures with poroshenko he was shown in</text>
  <text start="436.64" dur="5.1">pictures with other individuals</text>
  <text start="439.82" dur="6.3">extremists and fascist leaders in</text>
  <text start="441.74" dur="7.65">Ukraine back in 2014 of February and he</text>
  <text start="446.12" dur="5.63">was there with Lindsey Graham who was</text>
  <text start="449.39" dur="6.239">saying this is the year of the</text>
  <text start="451.75" dur="6.849">so he has connections to Ukraine we also</text>
  <text start="455.629" dur="4.44">have Maxine Waters now it&amp;#39;s not clear if</text>
  <text start="458.599" dur="3.391">Waters has any direct connection with</text>
  <text start="460.069" dur="5.521">Ukrainian authorities but an innocent</text>
  <text start="461.99" dur="6.84">innocent prank call by the Russian comic</text>
  <text start="465.59" dur="5.46">callers vovan and Lexus to waters</text>
  <text start="468.83" dur="5.73">reveals that she is highly susceptible</text>
  <text start="471.05" dur="5.51">to anti Russian propaganda the fact that</text>
  <text start="474.56" dur="4.259">she engaged with the prank callers</text>
  <text start="476.56" dur="4.419">seemingly believing that they were</text>
  <text start="478.819" dur="4.831">officials from Kiev means that waters</text>
  <text start="480.979" dur="4.74">ought to be questioned about any real</text>
  <text start="483.65" dur="4.919">calls she may have taken from actual</text>
  <text start="485.719" dur="5.16">Ukrainian regime officials and then of</text>
  <text start="488.569" dur="6.181">course we have Lindsey Graham he was</text>
  <text start="490.879" dur="6.9">there with McCain in Ukraine speaking to</text>
  <text start="494.75" dur="6.029">leaders out there poroshenko speaking to</text>
  <text start="497.779" dur="4.771">fascists saying this is the year of the</text>
  <text start="500.779" dur="4.17">offensive and there are many other</text>
  <text start="502.55" dur="5.239">individuals that should be investigated</text>
  <text start="504.949" dur="7.051">we also should look into the charitable</text>
  <text start="507.789" dur="6.75">foundations because are these charitable</text>
  <text start="512" dur="5.579">foundations really helping other</text>
  <text start="514.539" dur="7.151">individuals or is it a money-laundering</text>
  <text start="517.579" dur="8.331">operation now think about this back in</text>
  <text start="521.69" dur="7.009">2010 Bill Clinton went to Moscow for a</text>
  <text start="525.91" dur="5.799">question-and-answer session with</text>
  <text start="528.699" dur="5.351">Renaissance Capital Renaissance is owned</text>
  <text start="531.709" dur="6.151">by a Russian billionaire Mikhail</text>
  <text start="534.05" dur="5.52">Prokhorov for his efforts he was</text>
  <text start="537.86" dur="4.289">compensated five hundred thousand and</text>
  <text start="539.57" dur="5.699">received a personal thank-you from</text>
  <text start="542.149" dur="4.861">Russian President Vladimir Putin well</text>
  <text start="545.269" dur="5.041">there&amp;#39;s a connection with Russia and</text>
  <text start="547.01" dur="7.29">then we have the Clintons Charitable</text>
  <text start="550.31" dur="6.719">Foundation and anyone looking into the</text>
  <text start="554.3" dur="5.52">DNC anything that has to do with the</text>
  <text start="557.029" dur="5.191">Clintons or their chattable foundation</text>
  <text start="559.82" dur="6.09">it always seems that these individuals</text>
  <text start="562.22" dur="6.6">end up dead now there really hasn&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="565.91" dur="6.45">much coverage over Klaus ever winds</text>
  <text start="568.82" dur="6.42">death now everyone was a former Haitian</text>
  <text start="572.36" dur="5.46">government official who was going to</text>
  <text start="575.24" dur="6">expose the extent of the Clinton</text>
  <text start="577.82" dur="6.54">Foundation on how they were dealing in</text>
  <text start="581.24" dur="4.24">corruption malpractice and he was going</text>
  <text start="584.36" dur="4.39">to do this next week</text>
  <text start="585.48" dur="6.84">and guess what he was found dead in</text>
  <text start="588.75" dur="6.03">Miami at the age of 50 now the</text>
  <text start="592.32" dur="5.25">circumstances surrounding his death are</text>
  <text start="594.78" dur="4.62">actually kind of strange because</text>
  <text start="597.57" dur="4.62">according to Miami Dade&amp;#39;s medical</text>
  <text start="599.4" dur="7.28">examiner it looks like the official</text>
  <text start="602.19" dur="8.16">cause of death is a gunshot to the head</text>
  <text start="606.68" dur="7.12">so he was going to expose the Clinton</text>
  <text start="610.35" dur="5.94">Foundation and he ended up dead if we</text>
  <text start="613.8" dur="5.04">look at Seth rich he was handing over</text>
  <text start="616.29" dur="5.94">emails and information that was going on</text>
  <text start="618.84" dur="4.68">in the DNC and he was also shot I mean</text>
  <text start="622.23" dur="3.23">are we starting to see a pattern if we</text>
  <text start="623.52" dur="4.95">go back in time there are many other</text>
  <text start="625.46" dur="7.57">instances where people who cross the</text>
  <text start="628.47" dur="7.23">Clintons they kind of end up dead so the</text>
  <text start="633.03" dur="4.83">investigation from this new FBI director</text>
  <text start="635.7" dur="3.84">needs to start they need to start</text>
  <text start="637.86" dur="4.89">digging into all of this because if we</text>
  <text start="639.54" dur="6.78">use the same rationale with Russia they</text>
  <text start="642.75" dur="6.36">will find so much that this will be</text>
  <text start="646.32" dur="4.64">blown wide open and we&amp;#39;ll have to see</text>
  <text start="649.11" dur="5.01">how this turns out but we can see as</text>
  <text start="650.96" dur="5.38">they continually go down the rabbit hole</text>
  <text start="654.12" dur="5.16">and they tried to prove things about</text>
  <text start="656.34" dur="6.15">Trump and about his son and Russian</text>
  <text start="659.28" dur="8.1">collusion it seems like it&amp;#39;s all going</text>
  <text start="662.49" dur="8.79">back to Obama Susan Rice Loretta Lynch</text>
  <text start="667.38" dur="7.05">Bill Clinton the Clinton Foundation the</text>
  <text start="671.28" dur="7.11">DNC and if you notice it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="674.43" dur="7.56">become a pattern now of where everything</text>
  <text start="678.39" dur="7.71">is being done where it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="681.99" dur="6.63">orchestrated and if they dig a little</text>
  <text start="686.1" dur="7.02">bit they&amp;#39;re going to find a whole bunch</text>
  <text start="688.62" dur="7.44">of stuff now Italy is out there they are</text>
  <text start="693.12" dur="3.9">threatening the EU because remember</text>
  <text start="696.06" dur="3.87">about two weeks ago</text>
  <text start="697.02" dur="4.98">Italy reacted with anger to Austria&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="699.93" dur="3.6">deployment of troops and armed vehicles</text>
  <text start="702" dur="4.26">to the border because of Austria said</text>
  <text start="703.53" dur="4.98">listen we&amp;#39;re not letting these migrants</text>
  <text start="706.26" dur="4.56">in this is ridiculous that&amp;#39;s getting on</text>
  <text start="708.51" dur="4.92">hand and we need to guard our borders</text>
  <text start="710.82" dur="4.71">now Italy they are continually receiving</text>
  <text start="713.43" dur="5.849">all these different migrants and</text>
  <text start="715.53" dur="6.289">refugees and they are mounting up here</text>
  <text start="719.279" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re up to about 200,000 already and</text>
  <text start="721.819" dur="3.611">Italy saying listen we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="723.689" dur="3.63">using the nuclear option where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="725.43" dur="5.009">just going to let 200,000 migrants out</text>
  <text start="727.319" dur="7.231">of Italy and let them travel across</text>
  <text start="730.439" dur="7.44">Europe into Brussels and remember where</text>
  <text start="734.55" dur="5.55">is all this coming from this is coming</text>
  <text start="737.879" dur="5.911">from what the deep state has been doing</text>
  <text start="740.1" dur="5.13">all along with all these wars with all</text>
  <text start="743.79" dur="3.899">these regime change</text>
  <text start="745.23" dur="5.599">so we again we need to go back to the</text>
  <text start="747.689" dur="6.241">cause the cause is the deep state</text>
  <text start="750.829" dur="6.31">they&amp;#39;re the ones who created all this</text>
  <text start="753.93" dur="5.49">problem and if we can just remove our</text>
  <text start="757.139" dur="5.94">troops if we can just get out of the</text>
  <text start="759.42" dur="5.579">Middle East and stop all of this guess</text>
  <text start="763.079" dur="3.93">what all these individuals can go back</text>
  <text start="764.999" dur="4.921">home it&amp;#39;s that simple I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="767.009" dur="6.39">already seeing it in Syria where Russia</text>
  <text start="769.92" dur="5.609">the Syrian forces they&amp;#39;ve cleared many</text>
  <text start="773.399" dur="3.63">and liberated many of the cities and</text>
  <text start="775.529" dur="2.701">towns and the people said you know</text>
  <text start="777.029" dur="3">something we don&amp;#39;t need to go to Europe</text>
  <text start="778.23" dur="3.539">we want to go back to Syria we want to</text>
  <text start="780.029" dur="3.93">go back to our homes this is what people</text>
  <text start="781.769" dur="5.581">want to do they don&amp;#39;t want to flee their</text>
  <text start="783.959" dur="5.37">country yet they don&amp;#39;t want war that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="787.35" dur="3.69">why they fled in the first place but</text>
  <text start="789.329" dur="3.81">once everything calms down and all these</text>
  <text start="791.04" dur="4.469">terrorists are out of their area they</text>
  <text start="793.139" dur="4.471">want to come back and this is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="795.509" dur="4.921">happening right now now the Iranians</text>
  <text start="797.61" dur="7.05">they&amp;#39;re saying listen our troops will</text>
  <text start="800.43" dur="6.75">remain in Syria until the government of</text>
  <text start="804.66" dur="3.96">Syria says we are no longer needed so</text>
  <text start="807.18" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re going to stay in there Russia</text>
  <text start="808.62" dur="3.75">their Parliament gave them the green</text>
  <text start="810.72" dur="4.26">light for the long term deployment of</text>
  <text start="812.37" dur="4.56">the military force to Syria right now so</text>
  <text start="814.98" dur="5.279">they&amp;#39;re going to keep many m24</text>
  <text start="816.93" dur="6.209">helicopter gunships su-25 fighter jets</text>
  <text start="820.259" dur="5.25">within Syria and they are not leaving as</text>
  <text start="823.139" dur="3.69">of yet they&amp;#39;re going to stay there for</text>
  <text start="825.509" dur="3.601">quite a while to make sure that</text>
  <text start="826.829" dur="3.57">everything is secure once all the</text>
  <text start="829.11" dur="4.44">terrorists and everything is said and</text>
  <text start="830.399" dur="6.3">done so it looks like Russia Iran</text>
  <text start="833.55" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re not leaving anytime soon now</text>
  <text start="836.699" dur="4.651">what we come to find out from Amnesty</text>
  <text start="839.04" dur="6.089">International is that this newly</text>
  <text start="841.35" dur="6.929">declassified US government audit shows</text>
  <text start="845.129" dur="5.64">that the US Army failed to keep tabs on</text>
  <text start="848.279" dur="4.881">more than 1 billion worth of arms and</text>
  <text start="850.769" dur="5.061">other military equipment</text>
  <text start="853.16" dur="5.58">now this equipment and these arms</text>
  <text start="855.83" dur="5.85">ammunition weapons they were channeled</text>
  <text start="858.74" dur="7.74">to Iraq under the Iraq train-and-equip</text>
  <text start="861.68" dur="7.71">fund the ite F from 2015 US Congress</text>
  <text start="866.48" dur="5.22">appropriated 1.6 billion for the ite F</text>
  <text start="869.39" dur="3.9">program the funds were earmarked to</text>
  <text start="871.7" dur="3.45">fight against the Islamic state in</text>
  <text start="873.29" dur="6.09">response to Obama&amp;#39;s counterterrorism</text>
  <text start="875.15" dur="6.63">campaign launched in 2014 now remember</text>
  <text start="879.38" dur="5.73">we reported on the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="881.78" dur="6.15">receiving weapons from the United States</text>
  <text start="885.11" dur="6.33">and remember Obama had control of</text>
  <text start="887.93" dur="6.93">telling the Pentagon what to do where to</text>
  <text start="891.44" dur="6.45">drop ammunition and where to bomb in</text>
  <text start="894.86" dur="7.2">Iraq and Syria and what we come to find</text>
  <text start="897.89" dur="7.4">out is that all these weapons they were</text>
  <text start="902.06" dur="6.3">purposely being dropped into these areas</text>
  <text start="905.29" dur="6.4">that&amp;#39;s how these terrorist groups got</text>
  <text start="908.36" dur="5.48">the weapons and this is why 1.6 billion</text>
  <text start="911.69" dur="4.98">dollars worth of weapons and other</text>
  <text start="913.84" dur="5.59">material has gone missing well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="916.67" dur="5.55">really not missing they were using it to</text>
  <text start="919.43" dur="6.54">supply to the Islamic state al Qaeda and</text>
  <text start="922.22" dur="5.55">other terrorist groups and we can see</text>
  <text start="925.97" dur="5.28">how this whole thing was done then they</text>
  <text start="927.77" dur="7.38">were using the oil convoys to help fund</text>
  <text start="931.25" dur="6.09">the Islamic state in Syria so we can see</text>
  <text start="935.15" dur="4.05">how this whole thing now is coming</text>
  <text start="937.34" dur="4.26">together and how they work this whole</text>
  <text start="939.2" dur="4.68">thing what&amp;#39;s interesting is that</text>
  <text start="941.6" dur="5.4">WikiLeaks is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="943.88" dur="5.1">saying that the 1700 emails prove that</text>
  <text start="947" dur="4.35">Hillary Clinton knew about the US</text>
  <text start="948.98" dur="6.51">military weapon shipments to al Qaeda</text>
  <text start="951.35" dur="5.91">and the Islamic state so we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="955.49" dur="5.07">to get all this information all those</text>
  <text start="957.26" dur="6.12">reports we have the emails and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="960.56" dur="4.47">starting to see this gigantic puzzle</text>
  <text start="963.38" dur="3">which we kind of knew all along because</text>
  <text start="965.03" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;ve been reporting on it for a very</text>
  <text start="966.38" dur="7.68">long time and we&amp;#39;re starting to see how</text>
  <text start="969.17" dur="7.17">this was all done now China is out there</text>
  <text start="974.06" dur="4.86">and they&amp;#39;re saying listen we are working</text>
  <text start="976.34" dur="4.44">with the Syrian government we&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="978.92" dur="6.03">for the post-war infrastructure</text>
  <text start="980.78" dur="6.3">investment and we are now working with</text>
  <text start="984.95" dur="5.82">Syria because</text>
  <text start="987.08" dur="7.2">the New Silk Road will go through Syria</text>
  <text start="990.77" dur="5.55">and we see already that the China Arab</text>
  <text start="994.28" dur="4.08">exchange Association announced that</text>
  <text start="996.32" dur="4.8">Beijing plans to invest two billion in</text>
  <text start="998.36" dur="4.86">an industrial park in Syria for a</text>
  <text start="1001.12" dur="4.26">hundred and fifteen Chinese companies</text>
  <text start="1003.22" dur="4.26">the New Silk Road is going to run</text>
  <text start="1005.38" dur="5.04">through Syria and we see already that</text>
  <text start="1007.48" dur="5.55">Russia China they&amp;#39;re already making</text>
  <text start="1010.42" dur="5.25">plans because they realize that the</text>
  <text start="1013.03" dur="7.29">terrorist groups they are done for the</text>
  <text start="1015.67" dur="6.63">last problem they have is this whole</text>
  <text start="1020.32" dur="5.55">thing that the deep state is setting up</text>
  <text start="1022.3" dur="6.24">where they want to split Syria and once</text>
  <text start="1025.87" dur="4.71">again when the world looks at this and</text>
  <text start="1028.54" dur="4.799">we could see that the deep state they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1030.58" dur="5">doing this as if well if they have a</text>
  <text start="1033.339" dur="6.481">base there then it&amp;#39;s separate from</text>
  <text start="1035.58" dur="5.74">Assad&amp;#39;s area to the west so this is a</text>
  <text start="1039.82" dur="3.51">separate part of the country and this is</text>
  <text start="1041.32" dur="4.05">what they normally do they try to make</text>
  <text start="1043.33" dur="4.65">it seem like this is what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1045.37" dur="6.39">right now and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is the</text>
  <text start="1047.98" dur="5.28">Kurd heads they&amp;#39;re saying listen this is</text>
  <text start="1051.76" dur="4.2">going to be our land they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="1053.26" dur="4.89">making a play to say that this is going</text>
  <text start="1055.96" dur="6.32">to be our independent land now once</text>
  <text start="1058.15" dur="7.44">again the United States the deep state</text>
  <text start="1062.28" dur="7.63">they&amp;#39;re the ones who created all these</text>
  <text start="1065.59" dur="7.11">paid mercenary forces the Syrian</text>

  <text start="1149.809" dur="5.19">right now but again they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="1153.379" dur="7.05">because this is not part of their plan</text>
  <text start="1154.999" dur="7.14">they want to break up Syria because they</text>
  <text start="1160.429" dur="3.901">don&amp;#39;t want the Silk Road they want to</text>
