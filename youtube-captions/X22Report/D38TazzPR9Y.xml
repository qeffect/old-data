  <text start="45.73" dur="4.89">hi and welcome you&amp;#39;re listening to the X</text>
  <text start="48.97" dur="4.2">when he to report my name is dave and</text>
  <text start="50.62" dur="6.03">this is episode 1119 a and today&amp;#39;s date</text>
  <text start="53.17" dur="6.029">is November 4th 2016 and totally episode</text>
  <text start="56.65" dur="6.479">is US government manipulates the economy</text>
  <text start="59.199" dur="6.151">just in time for the election let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="63.129" dur="5.761">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="65.35" dur="7.97">news well I have to say the government</text>
  <text start="68.89" dur="9.18">really doesn&amp;#39;t disappoint it seems that</text>
  <text start="73.32" dur="6.85">they follow the pattern exactly I know a</text>
  <text start="78.07" dur="3.36">couple of weeks ago when the GDP number</text>
  <text start="80.17" dur="4.11">came out it was two-point-nine percent</text>
  <text start="81.43" dur="4.92">surged I was scratching my head saying</text>
  <text start="84.28" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s really strange it looks like they</text>
  <text start="86.35" dur="4.62">were setting up for an unemployment</text>
  <text start="88.66" dur="6.27">number which looks much better than it</text>
  <text start="90.97" dur="5.94">is and we know what happens people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="94.93" dur="4.2">look at the past numbers they only look</text>
  <text start="96.91" dur="4.65">at the new number and the previous</text>
  <text start="99.13" dur="3.78">number and all they did was play with</text>
  <text start="101.56" dur="3.059">the unemployment numbers where they</text>
  <text start="102.91" dur="5.28">brought it up a little bit people like</text>
  <text start="104.619" dur="6.571">not a big deal then right before the</text>
  <text start="108.19" dur="5.37">election they brought it down to four</text>
  <text start="111.19" dur="5.61">point nine percent and it does sound</text>
  <text start="113.56" dur="8.369">good it does sound like the election the</text>
  <text start="116.8" dur="6.569">the economy is doing very well and they</text>
  <text start="121.929" dur="3.03">did it right before the election so</text>
  <text start="123.369" dur="3.271">right do they have right now they have</text>
  <text start="124.959" dur="3.8">the GDP number at two-point-nine percent</text>
  <text start="126.64" dur="4.92">which it surged of course that was</text>
  <text start="128.759" dur="4.421">because of soybean exports which is a</text>
  <text start="131.56" dur="6.45">one-time thing which it looks like the</text>
  <text start="133.18" dur="7.23">government created that surge so they</text>
  <text start="138.01" dur="4.35">would have an incredible number they</text>
  <text start="140.41" dur="4.38">gave that one out first and then they</text>
  <text start="142.36" dur="4.17">waited and they waited they play with</text>
  <text start="144.79" dur="4.02">the unemployment numbers previously to</text>
  <text start="146.53" dur="4.86">get them up a little bit allow them to</text>
  <text start="148.81" dur="5.759">get the five so they can bring it right</text>
  <text start="151.39" dur="5.69">back down to four point nine percent and</text>
  <text start="154.569" dur="5.131">they waited days before the election</text>
  <text start="157.08" dur="5.32">perfect timing so they don&amp;#39;t disappoint</text>
  <text start="159.7" dur="5.28">we were right on target that they were</text>
  <text start="162.4" dur="7.29">going to do this and when we look at</text>
  <text start="164.98" dur="6.54">these job numbers we see that the BLS is</text>
  <text start="169.69" dur="4.32">telling us that the October jobs they</text>
  <text start="171.52" dur="5.51">rose by 161,000 which missed</text>
  <text start="174.01" dur="4.8">expectations the September print was</text>
  <text start="177.03" dur="7.09">156,000 and it was</text>
  <text start="178.81" dur="7.259">it was a revised upward to 191,000 while</text>
  <text start="184.12" dur="6.38">the change in employment for August was</text>
  <text start="186.069" dur="7.021">revised up from 167,000 to 176,000</text>
  <text start="190.5" dur="5.23">resulting in a combined employment gains</text>
  <text start="193.09" dur="5.21">in August in September a forty four</text>
  <text start="195.73" dur="4.53">thousand more than previously reported</text>
  <text start="198.3" dur="4">so we can see what they did right there</text>
  <text start="200.26" dur="6.03">and then the unemployment rate dipped</text>
  <text start="202.3" dur="7.86">from five percent to 4.9 percent right</text>
  <text start="206.29" dur="7.56">on cue I mean I really thought that they</text>
  <text start="210.16" dur="8.15">that they forgot to do it but in reality</text>
  <text start="213.85" dur="9.719">they are sticking to their pattern and</text>
  <text start="218.31" dur="7.42">we can see in October the number of</text>
  <text start="223.569" dur="4.321">people employed by food and services and</text>
  <text start="225.73" dur="6.569">drinking places well that went up by ten</text>
  <text start="227.89" dur="7.349">thousand but on the other hand the US</text>
  <text start="232.299" dur="6.601">workforce force lost nine thousand</text>
  <text start="235.239" dur="5.941">manufacturing workers and something</text>
  <text start="238.9" dur="4.399">doesn&amp;#39;t seem right here because we know</text>
  <text start="241.18" dur="4.339">with the National Restaurant Association</text>
  <text start="243.299" dur="4.78">restaurant performance activity index</text>
  <text start="245.519" dur="4.69">that has been falling and we know</text>
  <text start="248.079" dur="5.521">there&amp;#39;s restaurants like Logan&amp;#39;s fox and</text>
  <text start="250.209" dur="7.161">hound Bob Evans well mass closures</text>
  <text start="253.6" dur="7.62">bankruptcies and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="257.37" dur="6.52">performance index is showing that well</text>
  <text start="261.22" dur="3.99">there&amp;#39;s not a lot of foot traffic not a</text>
  <text start="263.89" dur="4.529">lot of people coming into restaurants</text>
  <text start="265.21" dur="7.16">like it was before so something doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="268.419" dur="7.97">sound right and it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like</text>
  <text start="272.37" dur="7.63">these people actually are finding these</text>
  <text start="276.389" dur="6.28">restaurant jobs it seems like they might</text>
  <text start="280" dur="5.1">be making this up at this point just to</text>
  <text start="282.669" dur="4.681">make it all look good we see in October</text>
  <text start="285.1" dur="5.3">the number of Americans who are not in</text>
  <text start="287.35" dur="7.14">the labor force rose by a substantial</text>
  <text start="290.4" dur="8.489">425,000 to 90 4609 the highest print in</text>
  <text start="294.49" dur="7.35">the series since May and it seems that</text>
  <text start="298.889" dur="4.181">people cannot find jobs because there</text>
  <text start="301.84" dur="5.069">are more and more people that are</text>
  <text start="303.07" dur="5.82">outside of the labor force and we know</text>
  <text start="306.909" dur="4.201">there&amp;#39;s a lot of layoffs going on right</text>
  <text start="308.89" dur="3.679">now and people are saying there&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="311.11" dur="4.85">very difficult period</text>
  <text start="312.569" dur="5.91">time to find a job yes can you find</text>
  <text start="315.96" dur="4.62">those temporary jobs right now for the</text>
  <text start="318.479" dur="3.571">holiday season but those a temporary</text>
  <text start="320.58" dur="3.599">those are only going to last you know</text>
  <text start="322.05" dur="7.079">two three months and then what do you do</text>
  <text start="324.179" dur="7.77">and we can see right now that eighty-two</text>
  <text start="329.129" dur="7.74">percent of American workers they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="331.949" dur="6.69">feeling any wage growth whatsoever the</text>
  <text start="336.869" dur="4.56">BLS reported that the average hourly</text>
  <text start="338.639" dur="6.42">earnings for all workers rose by 0.4% on</text>
  <text start="341.429" dur="7.53">a monthly basis and that was a little</text>
  <text start="345.059" dur="6.33">bit more than expected well this was due</text>
  <text start="348.959" dur="6.121">because of upward reversions to earlier</text>
  <text start="351.389" dur="7.95">months the vast majority of workers real</text>
  <text start="355.08" dur="6.75">wage growth doesn&amp;#39;t really exist because</text>
  <text start="359.339" dur="4.771">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that wage</text>
  <text start="361.83" dur="5.339">growth compared to inflation which is</text>
  <text start="364.11" dur="7.919">let&amp;#39;s use the government numbers 1.5% in</text>
  <text start="367.169" dur="6.78">September or 2.2% for core items which</text>
  <text start="372.029" dur="9.081">we know this is much much more than this</text>
  <text start="373.949" dur="10.76">it&amp;#39;s not keeping up and we realize that</text>
  <text start="381.11" dur="6.789">more and more people they have to take</text>
  <text start="384.709" dur="5.49">part-time jobs maybe one or two</text>
  <text start="387.899" dur="6.81">part-time jobs and what we&amp;#39;ve seen is</text>
  <text start="390.199" dur="8.5">that more and more people have lost</text>
  <text start="394.709" dur="7.71">their full-time job and they&amp;#39;ve taken</text>
  <text start="398.699" dur="5.82">part time jobs because in September the</text>
  <text start="402.419" dur="4.941">household survey revealed that the</text>
  <text start="404.519" dur="5.79">number of part-time workers sword by</text>
  <text start="407.36" dur="6.759">430,000 as full-time workers actually</text>
  <text start="410.309" dur="6.57">declined by 5,000 the trend continued in</text>
  <text start="414.119" dur="4.95">October when another 103,000 full-time</text>
  <text start="416.879" dur="4.981">jobs were lost which was offset by</text>
  <text start="419.069" dur="5.16">90,000 increase in part-time jobs in</text>
  <text start="421.86" dur="5.909">other words the transition duport time</text>
  <text start="424.229" dur="6.47">worker society appears to have resumed</text>
  <text start="427.769" dur="6.3">and this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="430.699" dur="6.97">but more troubling than that when we</text>
  <text start="434.069" dur="5.7">look at the job quality the number of</text>
  <text start="437.669" dur="4.441">multiple job holders or people who are</text>
  <text start="439.769" dur="5.21">forced to hold more than one job because</text>
  <text start="442.11" dur="4.92">the wages are very low well guess what</text>
  <text start="444.979" dur="5.321">that is going up</text>
  <text start="447.03" dur="6.71">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that the number</text>
  <text start="450.3" dur="8.99">of multiple job holders rose to 8.0 five</text>
  <text start="453.74" dur="8.4">million the highest number this century</text>
  <text start="459.29" dur="6.07">so we have to ask ourselves a question</text>
  <text start="462.14" dur="6.04">the hundred and sixty one thousand jobs</text>
  <text start="465.36" dur="5.58">that were added most likely they were</text>
  <text start="468.18" dur="7.5">double counted of those individuals</text>
  <text start="470.94" dur="8.51">having to three part-time jobs because</text>
  <text start="475.68" dur="7.08">that&amp;#39;s how they count a full-time job</text>
  <text start="479.45" dur="5.02">anybody that has a part-time job that is</text>
  <text start="482.76" dur="3.96">counted as a full-time job if you have</text>
  <text start="484.47" dur="8.13">two part-time jobs it&amp;#39;s one two</text>
  <text start="486.72" dur="7.08">full-time jobs we see that everything</text>
  <text start="492.6" dur="4.58">that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about about</text>
  <text start="493.8" dur="7.97">unemployment people not having work well</text>
  <text start="497.18" dur="10.69">we&amp;#39;re getting indications that this is</text>
  <text start="501.77" dur="9.31">absolutely a fact and I know Obama the</text>
  <text start="507.87" dur="5.67">corporate media the Fed they want to</text>
  <text start="511.08" dur="5.16">tell us how great it is and how there</text>
  <text start="513.54" dur="7.71">are so many jobs out there then why are</text>
  <text start="516.24" dur="8.25">there so more so many more families who</text>
  <text start="521.25" dur="5.79">are living on the street for example in</text>
  <text start="524.49" dur="4.86">new york city new york city shelters</text>
  <text start="527.04" dur="7.23">each night they&amp;#39;re up by eighty-five</text>
  <text start="529.35" dur="6.3">percent since 2010 and currently stands</text>
  <text start="534.27" dur="5.7">at the highest level since the Great</text>
  <text start="535.65" dur="7.32">Depression of 1930 and when we look at</text>
  <text start="539.97" dur="6.24">Mayor Bill de Blasio&amp;#39;s at fiscal 2016</text>
  <text start="542.97" dur="6.48">the mayor&amp;#39;s management report well we</text>
  <text start="546.21" dur="7.11">see that more people are requesting</text>
  <text start="549.45" dur="7.35">emergency rent assistance there was a</text>
  <text start="553.32" dur="5.16">forty two percent increase where</text>
  <text start="556.8" dur="4.38">families are saying we don&amp;#39;t have enough</text>
  <text start="558.48" dur="8.16">money to pay our rent we need some type</text>
  <text start="561.18" dur="8.85">of assistance and this shows us that we</text>
  <text start="566.64" dur="7.55">have a major problem here in some</text>
  <text start="570.03" dur="6.21">respects were worse off than the 30s and</text>
  <text start="574.19" dur="4.06">from all the indicators from from</text>
  <text start="576.24" dur="3.24">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at we</text>
  <text start="578.25" dur="6.899">are now seeing</text>
  <text start="579.48" dur="7.26">that we most likely are on the edge of a</text>
  <text start="585.149" dur="3.031">depression here there are many</text>
  <text start="586.74" dur="4.14">individuals already saying that we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="588.18" dur="5.099">a recession on one of them and I believe</text>
  <text start="590.88" dur="6.78">we are almost ready to enter a</text>
  <text start="593.279" dur="6.511">depression state and of course everyone</text>
  <text start="597.66" dur="4.169">thinks everything is fine because the</text>
  <text start="599.79" dur="4.5">corporate media they government the Fed</text>
  <text start="601.829" dur="6.331">they use the illusion that everything is</text>
  <text start="604.29" dur="6.419">fine and it&amp;#39;s all perception until you</text>
  <text start="608.16" dur="5.1">go try to find that job and when more</text>
  <text start="610.709" dur="6.351">and more people lose their jobs they</text>
  <text start="613.26" dur="6.03">start to realize there&amp;#39;s something wrong</text>
  <text start="617.06" dur="6.82">because the only job they can find is a</text>
  <text start="619.29" dur="7.109">part-time job so what is happening right</text>
  <text start="623.88" dur="5.37">now is that this economy is</text>
  <text start="626.399" dur="7.651">deteriorating very very quickly we are</text>
  <text start="629.25" dur="7.38">sliding into a depression and during or</text>
  <text start="634.05" dur="5.279">after this election we are going to see</text>
  <text start="636.63" dur="6">everything really start to unravel very</text>
  <text start="639.329" dur="5.671">very quickly and this is why if you</text>
  <text start="642.63" dur="4.23">haven&amp;#39;t gotten your supplies if you</text>
  <text start="645" dur="4.47">haven&amp;#39;t prepped if you haven&amp;#39;t done</text>
  <text start="646.86" dur="4.32">anything at this point I would just</text>
  <text start="649.47" dur="4.32">start by getting food and some water and</text>
  <text start="651.18" dur="5.19">keeping cash on hand if you can do more</text>
  <text start="653.79" dur="5.94">that&amp;#39;s fine but we can see right now</text>
  <text start="656.37" dur="6.089">from many people out there who&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="659.73" dur="6.839">telling us that we&amp;#39;re in a recession</text>
  <text start="662.459" dur="6.481">that the economy is not doing as well as</text>
  <text start="666.569" dur="5.791">the government the central bank has been</text>
  <text start="668.94" dur="5.31">telling us we need to get prepared</text>
