  <text start="107.07" dur="4.62">plan through the house they still have</text>
  <text start="109.259" dur="4.081">to push it through the Senate and right</text>

  <text start="120.54" dur="4.44">this is not right for the people and the</text>
  <text start="123.24" dur="3.75">only way we&amp;#39;ll really know that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="124.98" dur="5.249">right for the people as if the entire</text>
  <text start="126.99" dur="6.42">government takes on this plan and they</text>
  <text start="130.229" dur="6.051">drop their health insurance and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="133.41" dur="6.12">talking about the house the senate</text>
  <text start="136.28" dur="5.739">president vice-president you name it</text>
  <text start="139.53" dur="4.709">they need to drop what they have and</text>
  <text start="142.019" dur="4.111">take on this new health insurance they</text>
  <text start="144.239" dur="5.131">didn&amp;#39;t do it with obamacare because they</text>
  <text start="146.13" dur="5.579">knew that hey i don&amp;#39;t want this but we</text>
  <text start="149.37" dur="5.13">can see there might be a strategy here i</text>
  <text start="151.709" dur="3.691">don&amp;#39;t know if the republican health care</text>
  <text start="154.5" dur="2.34">plan is going to make it through the</text>
  <text start="155.4" dur="3.089">senate senate saying that we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="156.84" dur="3.09">create our own health care plan but</text>
  <text start="158.489" dur="3.991">isn&amp;#39;t that how it really works but</text>
  <text start="159.93" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re so desperate to stop this that</text>
  <text start="162.48" dur="5.85">they don&amp;#39;t want this to move forward</text>
  <text start="165" dur="5.64">here and i think one of the reasons why</text>
  <text start="168.33" dur="5.219">they&amp;#39;re saying hey take your time with</text>
  <text start="170.64" dur="4.92">it let&amp;#39;s do it right it&amp;#39;s because they</text>
  <text start="173.549" dur="3.381">know that obama care is dying right now</text>
  <text start="175.56" dur="3.81">this might be part of their strategy</text>
  <text start="176.93" dur="8.2">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing is that you in</text>
  <text start="179.37" dur="7.05">a I awoke uh</text>
  <text start="185.13" dur="3.39">backing out</text>
  <text start="186.42" dur="5.429">the system we see out in Maryland</text>
  <text start="188.52" dur="6.87">premiums are about to skyrocket Maryland</text>
  <text start="191.849" dur="6.961">residents are looking at higher premiums</text>
  <text start="195.39" dur="5.33">right now and the largest insurer care</text>
  <text start="198.81" dur="4.11">first Blue Cross Blue Shield is</text>
  <text start="200.72" dur="5.65">requesting a 50 percent year-on-year</text>
  <text start="202.92" dur="6.33">premium increase now the new rates would</text>
  <text start="206.37" dur="4.98">mean that a 40 year old nonsmoker in the</text>
  <text start="209.25" dur="3.959">Baltimore area would face premiums</text>
  <text start="211.35" dur="3.51">ranging from three hundred fifty nine</text>
  <text start="213.209" dur="4.681">dollars a month to seven hundred and</text>
  <text start="214.86" dur="5.879">fifteen dollars before receiving any</text>
  <text start="217.89" dur="4.89">federal subsidies now CareFirst said the</text>
  <text start="220.739" dur="4.08">rate increase are necessary because the</text>
  <text start="222.78" dur="4.2">company has lost six hundred million</text>
  <text start="224.819" dur="4.14">dollars serving Obamacare exchanges</text>
  <text start="226.98" dur="3.63">since the company first started selling</text>
  <text start="228.959" dur="4.651">plans in the marketplace four years ago</text>
  <text start="230.61" dur="5.61">now remember how they designed Obamacare</text>
  <text start="233.61" dur="4.23">the reason why there&amp;#39;s a penalty is</text>
  <text start="236.22" dur="5.88">because when the insurance companies</text>
  <text start="237.84" dur="6.03">initially wrote this deal this bill they</text>
  <text start="242.1" dur="3.54">wanted to make sure that everyone was</text>
  <text start="243.87" dur="5.19">going to be in on their system they</text>
  <text start="245.64" dur="7.2">needed a gigantic base of individuals</text>
  <text start="249.06" dur="6.84">buying their insurance and the only way</text>
  <text start="252.84" dur="4.649">to force everyone into the system is to</text>
  <text start="255.9" dur="3.78">penalize people where they said oh</text>
  <text start="257.489" dur="4.201">people don&amp;#39;t want to get the pen they</text>
  <text start="259.68" dur="3.48">don&amp;#39;t want to be penalized so they will</text>
  <text start="261.69" dur="3.539">opt in for health insurance because</text>
  <text start="263.16" dur="4.379">they&amp;#39;d rather have coverage and what</text>
  <text start="265.229" dur="3.991">happened was is that people said you</text>
  <text start="267.539" dur="3.601">know something I can&amp;#39;t afford this</text>
  <text start="269.22" dur="4.23">coverage because again they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="271.14" dur="3.899">understanding what was going on in the</text>
  <text start="273.45" dur="4.05">United States where the economy was</text>
  <text start="275.039" dur="3.991">failing and people decided to take the</text>
  <text start="277.5" dur="4.11">penalty because it was a lot cheaper and</text>
  <text start="279.03" dur="5.04">as more and more people decided to opt</text>
  <text start="281.61" dur="4.369">out of the health care industry while</text>
  <text start="284.07" dur="5.31">this hurt the insurance companies and</text>
  <text start="285.979" dur="5.021">they weren&amp;#39;t able to make the profit</text>
  <text start="289.38" dur="2.34">they wanted to make because they thought</text>
  <text start="291" dur="3.69">they were going to have the entire</text>
  <text start="291.72" dur="5.13">country in on this health insurance and</text>
  <text start="294.69" dur="5.13">they started to lose money so they had</text>
  <text start="296.85" dur="5.25">to raise premiums and it got worse and</text>
  <text start="299.82" dur="4.83">worse as time went on because what</text>
  <text start="302.1" dur="4.47">happened was the system was never</text>
  <text start="304.65" dur="4.079">designed to really help the people it</text>
  <text start="306.57" dur="5.73">was designed to make the insurance</text>
  <text start="308.729" dur="5.671">companies very very wealthy because most</text>
  <text start="312.3" dur="3.57">of the plans had huge deductibles where</text>
  <text start="314.4" dur="4.62">the insurance companies wouldn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="315.87" dur="4.32">have to pay out and the government paid</text>
  <text start="319.02" dur="3.66">subsidies</text>
  <text start="320.19" dur="4.83">on the poor so there were no benefits</text>
  <text start="322.68" dur="5.04">really to the everyday person yes a</text>
  <text start="325.02" dur="4.83">small group got some benefits while the</text>
  <text start="327.72" dur="4.83">rest of the nation they were struggling</text>
  <text start="329.85" dur="4.32">and about eight million or so plus</text>
  <text start="332.55" dur="4.71">people decided to opt out and that</text>
  <text start="334.17" dur="6.69">number is continually rising and again</text>
  <text start="337.26" dur="5.28">so far I see nothing from the</text>
  <text start="340.86" dur="5.01">Republicans nothing from the Democrats</text>
  <text start="342.54" dur="4.77">nothing from government to say hey here</text>
  <text start="345.87" dur="2.94">is something that will benefit the</text>
  <text start="347.31" dur="5.79">people because what they&amp;#39;re giving us is</text>
  <text start="348.81" dur="6.6">pure junk now we see Trump&amp;#39;s second</text>
  <text start="353.1" dur="4.86">nominee for army secretary he decided to</text>
  <text start="355.41" dur="4.8">borrow back out this is Mark Greene and</text>
  <text start="357.96" dur="4.23">he was all for the second amendment he</text>
  <text start="360.21" dur="4.62">decided that he&amp;#39;s not going to go for</text>
  <text start="362.19" dur="4.86">this so we&amp;#39;ll have to wait to see who</text>
  <text start="364.83" dur="3.08">the other nominee is going to be and we</text>
  <text start="367.05" dur="2.76">could see right now</text>
  <text start="367.91" dur="4.9">something must have curved because this</text>
  <text start="369.81" dur="4.8">is the second individual who didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="372.81" dur="3.96">to join on now either he was blackmailed</text>
  <text start="374.61" dur="4.05">something happened but this is very</text>
  <text start="376.77" dur="4.5">curious on how these individuals are</text>
  <text start="378.66" dur="4.56">continually backing out of this now</text>
  <text start="381.27" dur="3.87">virtually unnoticed by the majority of</text>
  <text start="383.22" dur="3.12">corporate media on Wednesday in a</text>
  <text start="385.14" dur="3.63">hearing before the Senate Judiciary</text>
  <text start="386.34" dur="3.84">Committee on the FBI&amp;#39;s oversight of the</text>
  <text start="388.77" dur="4.29">investigation of Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="390.18" dur="6.239">emails director James Comey revealed a</text>
  <text start="393.06" dur="5.79">murky effort as outlined in an</text>
  <text start="396.419" dur="4.711">undisclosed document by Attorney General</text>
  <text start="398.85" dur="4.23">Loretta Lynch or her associates to</text>
  <text start="401.13" dur="4.38">ensure that former presidential</text>
  <text start="403.08" dur="5.28">candidate would not be charged and</text>
  <text start="405.51" dur="4.89">that&amp;#39;s Hillary Clinton and this document</text>
  <text start="408.36" dur="4.11">apparently reveals the thwarting by</text>
  <text start="410.4" dur="4.58">Lynch and associates of any effort to</text>
  <text start="412.47" dur="5.97">hold Clinton accountable now Lynch</text>
  <text start="414.98" dur="6.1">intended to undertake a major effort to</text>
  <text start="418.44" dur="5.19">ensure Hillary Clinton would survive the</text>
  <text start="421.08" dur="4.56">crucial probe the document which has</text>
  <text start="423.63" dur="4.14">been described as both a memo and an</text>
  <text start="425.64" dur="4.08">email was written by a Democratic</text>
  <text start="427.77" dur="3.93">operative who expressed confidence that</text>
  <text start="429.72" dur="3.47">miss Lynch would keep the Clinton</text>
  <text start="431.7" dur="4.02">investigation from going too far</text>
  <text start="433.19" dur="5.34">according to some several former</text>
  <text start="435.72" dur="6.42">officials familiar with the document and</text>
  <text start="438.53" dur="7.15">we&amp;#39;ve known this that the Department of</text>
  <text start="442.14" dur="5.85">Justice at that time Obama the FBI they</text>
  <text start="445.68" dur="4.26">were really doing absolutely nothing</text>
  <text start="447.99" dur="5.34">even though WikiLeaks was pouring out</text>
  <text start="449.94" dur="6.749">all the emails showing that there was</text>
  <text start="453.33" dur="6.059">unsecured server it was wiped clean and</text>
  <text start="456.689" dur="3.871">the Department of Justice didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="459.389" dur="3">look into it at all</text>
  <text start="460.56" dur="3.77">they weren&amp;#39;t even curious of why this</text>
  <text start="462.389" dur="3.84">was happening I mean the whole thing</text>
  <text start="464.33" dur="3.67">sounded like a cover-up from the</text>
  <text start="466.229" dur="4.5">beginning beginning it still sounds like</text>
  <text start="468" dur="5.28">a cover-up and now information is</text>
  <text start="470.729" dur="4.351">continually coming out and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="473.28" dur="4.83">watch this to see how this turns out</text>
  <text start="475.08" dur="3.75">because will they do anything we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="478.11" dur="3.839">to wait and see</text>
  <text start="478.83" dur="7.049">now with the election in France we see</text>
  <text start="481.949" dur="7.081">Makran and lepen they are now in the</text>
  <text start="485.879" dur="4.981">midst of the election and there are exit</text>
  <text start="489.03" dur="5.069">polls and right now the exit polls are</text>
  <text start="490.86" dur="5.82">saying that Makran has the lead now</text>
  <text start="494.099" dur="4.97">again we don&amp;#39;t know this is true this is</text>
  <text start="496.68" dur="5.16">coming out of the corporate media and</text>
  <text start="499.069" dur="4.991">sometimes what they do is they try to</text>
  <text start="501.84" dur="3.9">convince people that this candidate is</text>
  <text start="504.06" dur="3.659">in the lead so more people go out and</text>
  <text start="505.74" dur="3.45">say well since that person&amp;#39;s an lead let</text>
  <text start="507.719" dur="3.57">me vote for this person anyhow they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="509.19" dur="4.95">going to win and that will be that but</text>
  <text start="511.289" dur="5.79">this election has seen a very low</text>
  <text start="514.14" dur="5.43">turnout right now of people coming out</text>
  <text start="517.079" dur="3.991">and voting and we can see right now I</text>
  <text start="519.57" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s because the country</text>
  <text start="521.07" dur="4.56">is under state of emergency maybe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="523.38" dur="5.149">because the Islamic state threatened to</text>
  <text start="525.63" dur="5.069">blow up polling stations and I think the</text>
  <text start="528.529" dur="3.101">central bankers the deep state they</text>
  <text start="530.699" dur="2.911">wanted it this way</text>
  <text start="531.63" dur="4.05">this way people wouldn&amp;#39;t come out and</text>
  <text start="533.61" dur="3.539">vote for lepen because they knew they</text>
  <text start="535.68" dur="4.17">couldn&amp;#39;t manipulate the electronic</text>
  <text start="537.149" dur="5.161">voting systems so they had to go another</text>
  <text start="539.85" dur="4.679">way now one way is to count the votes in</text>
  <text start="542.31" dur="4.35">the backroom where no one sees it or try</text>
  <text start="544.529" dur="5.611">to keep people away from the polls and</text>
  <text start="546.66" dur="6.119">only bring those in that will vote for</text>
  <text start="550.14" dur="4.05">Makran but we can see this is very close</text>
  <text start="552.779" dur="3.451">right now this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that macron</text>
  <text start="554.19" dur="4.29">has won and we&amp;#39;ll have to wait to see</text>
  <text start="556.23" dur="4.289">how this turns out we know that the deep</text>
  <text start="558.48" dur="6.15">state they are pushing their agenda to</text>
  <text start="560.519" dur="7.591">get McCrone into office they want their</text>
  <text start="564.63" dur="6.69">man in there now former President of</text>
  <text start="568.11" dur="5.25">Afghanistan Hamid Karzai he dropped a</text>
  <text start="571.32" dur="5.19">huge bombshell claiming that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="573.36" dur="5.01">created the Islamic state Karzai says he</text>
  <text start="576.51" dur="3.54">holds the u.s. directly responsible for</text>

  <text start="627.329" dur="3.94">they&amp;#39;re continually pushing the idea</text>
  <text start="630.009" dur="3.87">that North Korea is going to be</text>
  <text start="631.269" dur="5.1">attacking the United States Kim jong-un</text>

  <text start="636.369" dur="4.8">to assassinate him maybe have some type</text>
  <text start="639.16" dur="5.039">of chemical weapon attack inside of his</text>
  <text start="641.169" dur="5.551">country we also see coming out of the</text>
  <text start="644.199" dur="5.401">corporate media that North Korea has</text>
  <text start="646.72" dur="4.829">arrested the fourth American now they</text>
  <text start="649.6" dur="3.779">continually say this is coming out of</text>
  <text start="651.549" dur="4.08">North Korea&amp;#39;s official Korean Central</text>
  <text start="653.379" dur="5.31">News Agency and they&amp;#39;re saying all these</text>
  <text start="655.629" dur="5.851">different quotes from Kim jong-un is</text>
  <text start="658.689" dur="4.95">coming from this area and when you go</text>
  <text start="661.48" dur="5.189">and you visit North Korea&amp;#39;s official</text>
  <text start="663.639" dur="5.341">Korean Central News Agency you don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="666.669" dur="3.991">any stories about this whatsoever at</text>
  <text start="668.98" dur="4.38">least none that I could find right now</text>
  <text start="670.66" dur="5.429">and they&amp;#39;re continually pushing the idea</text>
  <text start="673.36" dur="5.069">that they&amp;#39;re continually arresting</text>
  <text start="676.089" dur="4.381">American after American after American</text>
  <text start="678.429" dur="4.77">and the corporate media is pushing it</text>
  <text start="680.47" dur="4.409">out there and one thing that I find very</text>
  <text start="683.199" dur="3.091">interesting first of all the Trump</text>
  <text start="684.879" dur="3.99">administration says they&amp;#39;re aware of</text>
  <text start="686.29" dur="4.889">this secondly we know the deep State</text>
  <text start="688.869" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to push their agenda</text>
  <text start="691.179" dur="5.31">out in North Korea and it&amp;#39;s just very</text>
  <text start="694.179" dur="4.74">interesting that Kim jong-un would start</text>
  <text start="696.489" dur="5.13">arresting all these individuals at this</text>
  <text start="698.919" dur="6.241">point where the United States China</text>
  <text start="701.619" dur="6.66">Russia Japan and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="705.16" dur="6">surrounding countries are surrounding</text>
  <text start="708.279" dur="5.071">him why would he provoke the United</text>
  <text start="711.16" dur="4.829">States like this it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="713.35" dur="5.25">because we saw this type of propaganda</text>
  <text start="715.989" dur="5.061">before out in Syria with the Islamic</text>
  <text start="718.6" dur="4.73">state where they were killing</text>
  <text start="721.05" dur="4.229">journalist and they produce the videos</text>
  <text start="723.33" dur="3.6">they put it out there and of course it</text>
  <text start="725.279" dur="3.901">turns out to be fake phony and false and</text>
  <text start="726.93" dur="5.01">the Islamic state was out there telling</text>
  <text start="729.18" dur="5.73">everyone you know common bombers bring</text>
  <text start="731.94" dur="4.35">it we&amp;#39;re taking over Syria now we have</text>
  <text start="734.91" dur="4.32">the corporate media trying to tell us</text>
  <text start="736.29" dur="5.21">that North Korea is threatening the</text>
  <text start="739.23" dur="5.34">United States threatening Japan</text>
  <text start="741.5" dur="6.22">threatening China and saying listen we</text>
  <text start="744.57" dur="5.639">will beat you we will attack you I mean</text>
  <text start="747.72" dur="4.859">do we not see the parallels here it</text>
  <text start="750.209" dur="5.791">looks like the deep state once again is</text>
  <text start="752.579" dur="7.351">using the same exact script now out in</text>
  <text start="756" dur="7.5">Iran we see the USS George HW Bush this</text>
  <text start="759.93" dur="7.17">is a aircraft carrier it is parked right</text>
  <text start="763.5" dur="7.649">off the coast of Iran and Iran is</text>
  <text start="767.1" dur="7.83">sending out drones to basically look at</text>
  <text start="771.149" dur="6.18">and surveil the aircraft carrier now</text>
  <text start="774.93" dur="5.94">officials are saying that this has</text>
  <text start="777.329" dur="7.051">become a nuisance that this is naked</text>
  <text start="780.87" dur="5.67">aggression against the United States US</text>
  <text start="784.38" dur="3.99">officials ever repeatedly made a big</text>
  <text start="786.54" dur="4.44">deal about Iran having ships off their</text>
  <text start="788.37" dur="4.409">own coast while Iranian officials have</text>
  <text start="790.98" dur="4.41">responded by saying don&amp;#39;t you think a</text>
  <text start="792.779" dur="6.781">better question is why is the US</text>
  <text start="795.39" dur="6.36">warships 7500 miles away from their own</text>
  <text start="799.56" dur="4.62">territorial waters and constantly</text>
  <text start="801.75" dur="5.04">looming around Iran&amp;#39;s code now we have</text>
  <text start="804.18" dur="5.279">to remember there&amp;#39;s a warship right</text>
  <text start="806.79" dur="6.77">outside the Iranian coast sitting there</text>
  <text start="809.459" dur="6.841">can you imagine if Iran or Syria or</text>
  <text start="813.56" dur="4.899">North Korea had one of their ships right</text>
  <text start="816.3" dur="4.409">off the coast of California New York or</text>
  <text start="818.459" dur="4.921">Florida and they were just sitting there</text>
  <text start="820.709" dur="4.591">how would the United States respond to</text>
  <text start="823.38" dur="5.13">this well we know how they would respond</text>
  <text start="825.3" dur="6.45">now out in Syria we see that Russia</text>
  <text start="828.51" dur="6.9">Syria Iran Turkey they set up these safe</text>
  <text start="831.75" dur="5.55">zones and residents in these areas are</text>
  <text start="835.41" dur="4.41">saying that the safe zones or these</text>
  <text start="837.3" dur="5.67">de-escalation zones they are a good</text>
  <text start="839.82" dur="5.04">thing one resident Nassar Ahmad said we</text>
  <text start="842.97" dur="3.75">hope it will be a good omen to prevent</text>
  <text start="844.86" dur="3.479">the bloodshed of people the government</text>
  <text start="846.72" dur="3.09">used to take care of everyone the</text>
  <text start="848.339" dur="3.99">reconciliations are good for the</text>
  <text start="849.81" dur="4.62">situation we live in this country other</text>
  <text start="852.329" dur="3.781">residents Ali Mohammed exper</text>
  <text start="854.43" dur="3.42">doubt about the rebels respecting the</text>
  <text start="856.11" dur="4.11">deal I don&amp;#39;t trust a terrorist</text>
  <text start="857.85" dur="4.35">whatsoever for we saw nothing from them</text>
  <text start="860.22" dur="4.59">but deceit nevertheless we are</text>
  <text start="862.2" dur="6.3">optimistic another resident said and</text>
  <text start="864.81" dur="5.31">this is Mona Khalil was a had similar</text>
  <text start="868.5" dur="3.72">opinions the terrorists will not comply</text>
  <text start="870.12" dur="4.5">with the resolution but we see the</text>
  <text start="872.22" dur="5.76">diskette de-escalation zones they are a</text>
  <text start="874.62" dur="5.219">good thing and it looks like Russia Iran</text>
  <text start="877.98" dur="3.45">Syria they&amp;#39;re going to have to protect</text>
  <text start="879.839" dur="4.731">these areas because we can see right now</text>
  <text start="881.43" dur="5.52">that one thing the Syrian opposition</text>
  <text start="884.57" dur="5.139">they said oh we&amp;#39;re all for the</text>
  <text start="886.95" dur="5.009">de-escalation agreement but we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="889.709" dur="5.761">going to fulfill it so they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="891.959" dur="6">to abide by the de-escalation zones and</text>
  <text start="895.47" dur="4.71">we can see that the deep state they</text>
  <text start="897.959" dur="5.82">don&amp;#39;t want a safe zone de-escalation</text>
  <text start="900.18" dur="5.88">zone from Russia or Iran or Turkey what</text>
  <text start="903.779" dur="4.771">they really want is their own safe zones</text>
  <text start="906.06" dur="3.96">where they can control it and this is</text>
  <text start="908.55" dur="3.42">not going to work for them and this is</text>
  <text start="910.02" dur="4.29">why we&amp;#39;re looking at the situation where</text>
  <text start="911.97" dur="5.369">something big is about to happen because</text>
  <text start="914.31" dur="5.61">out in Syria there are residents that</text>
  <text start="917.339" dur="5.391">say that there&amp;#39;s filming going on of</text>
  <text start="919.92" dur="5.78">staged attacks with the use of poisonous</text>
  <text start="922.73" dur="4.99">substances so the russian media</text>
  <text start="925.7" dur="3.759">published an article alleging that</text>
  <text start="927.72" dur="5.489">guitar-based television channel al</text>

  <text start="939.51" dur="5.28">province saying that the footage was</text>
  <text start="942.029" dur="4.861">ordered from the European country now</text>
  <text start="944.79" dur="4.77">the Russian Center for reconciliation of</text>
  <text start="946.89" dur="5.79">opposing sides in Syria reported citing</text>
  <text start="949.56" dur="6.54">local residents that representatives</text>

  <text start="976.17" dur="4.44">some of the consultants of the brigades</text>
  <text start="978.39" dur="3.99">were recognized by the locals as camera</text>
  <text start="980.61" dur="4.979">men shooting news in the region for Al</text>
  <text start="982.38" dur="5.37">Jazeera now al Jazeera they have denied</text>

  <text start="987.75" dur="4.14">is not the first time that such reports</text>
  <text start="990.12" dur="4.79">were out there because there was another</text>

  <text start="1008.18" dur="5.46">consequences of a chemical attack so</text>
  <text start="1010.87" dur="4.21">something is happening here and it looks</text>
  <text start="1013.64" dur="3.93">like they&amp;#39;re doing a lot of different</text>
  <text start="1015.08" dur="5.52">filming in different areas to show that</text>
