  <text start="121.89" dur="5.26">the central bank the head of the Fed</text>
  <text start="125.17" dur="4.65">right now most likely is working with</text>
  <text start="127.15" dur="5.75">Trump to raise the interest rates to</text>
  <text start="129.82" dur="5.88">bring down the system we have Trump</text>
  <text start="132.9" dur="5.86">manipulating the economic statistics</text>
  <text start="135.7" dur="5.19">just like the past presidents just like</text>
  <text start="138.76" dur="4.68">the central bank and the deep state have</text>
  <text start="140.89" dur="4.55">done in the past but they are pushing</text>
  <text start="143.44" dur="6.09">the economy to the street to the extreme</text>
  <text start="145.44" dur="7.18">pushing it to where nobody can say Trump</text>
  <text start="149.53" dur="5.34">crashed the economy because if you</text>
  <text start="152.62" dur="5.25">notice he continually tweets out the</text>
  <text start="154.87" dur="5.04">economy is doing fantastically look at</text>
  <text start="157.87" dur="4.08">the numbers look at unemployment these</text>
  <text start="159.91" dur="5.4">are statistical numbers if you notice</text>
  <text start="161.95" dur="6.48">he&amp;#39;s using all of the same exact data</text>
  <text start="165.31" dur="5.07">points that everyone else has used and</text>
  <text start="168.43" dur="3.27">they can&amp;#39;t argue with it because if they</text>
  <text start="170.38" dur="1.77">start to argue with it and start to pick</text>
  <text start="171.7" dur="3.66">it apart</text>
  <text start="172.15" dur="4.559">guess what he turns around and he says</text>
  <text start="175.36" dur="2.909">well these are the numbers that you gave</text>
  <text start="176.709" dur="3.271">us this is what we&amp;#39;ve been doing for a</text>
  <text start="178.269" dur="3.781">long time you&amp;#39;ve been using the same</text>
  <text start="179.98" dur="5.19">calculations you&amp;#39;re telling us they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="182.05" dur="4.8">manipulated how is this possible this is</text>
  <text start="185.17" dur="5.01">why they&amp;#39;re not going to do this</text>
  <text start="186.85" dur="5.94">and while this entire system starts to</text>
  <text start="190.18" dur="5.37">implode on itself we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="192.79" dur="4.44">cracks all over the place we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="195.55" dur="6">seeing cracks right now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="197.23" dur="6.03">talking about real-estate retail the</text>
  <text start="201.55" dur="5.31">corporate buybacks</text>
  <text start="203.26" dur="5.52">the loaning the interbank loaning we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="206.86" dur="5.07">been talking about all of this stuff and</text>
  <text start="208.78" dur="5.67">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing that everywhere we</text>
  <text start="211.93" dur="4.17">look we&amp;#39;re seeing problems in the</text>
  <text start="214.45" dur="3.51">economy yes if we look at the</text>
  <text start="216.1" dur="3.9">unemployment numbers you see nothing if</text>
  <text start="217.96" dur="3.78">you look at the GDP numbers you see</text>
  <text start="220" dur="4.35">nothing if you look at the stock market</text>
  <text start="221.74" dur="4.68">you see nothing but if you really take a</text>
  <text start="224.35" dur="3.72">close look at what&amp;#39;s really going on in</text>
  <text start="226.42" dur="3.69">the US economy and the global economy</text>
  <text start="228.07" dur="3.69">you can see that everything is breaking</text>
  <text start="230.11" dur="4.05">down list let&amp;#39;s take for example the</text>
  <text start="231.76" dur="5.28">housing market the housing market has</text>
  <text start="234.16" dur="5.19">been pumped up what they&amp;#39;ve done is</text>
  <text start="237.04" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;ve taken 20 cities the central bank</text>
  <text start="239.35" dur="5.07">has been issuing free money and these</text>
  <text start="243.07" dur="4.38">hedge funds investment companies have</text>
  <text start="244.42" dur="4.77">pumped up all of these cities to prices</text>
  <text start="247.45" dur="3.18">that we&amp;#39;ve never seen before actually</text>
  <text start="249.19" dur="3.99">there are a lot higher than they were</text>
  <text start="250.63" dur="5.97">back in 2008 right before everything</text>
  <text start="253.18" dur="5.67">started to collapse and interest rates</text>
  <text start="256.6" dur="3.69">were very very low this way it made it</text>
  <text start="258.85" dur="3.03">easy for people to get loans and</text>
  <text start="260.29" dur="3.03">actually it brings more people into the</text>
  <text start="261.88" dur="4.92">market because the lower the interest</text>
  <text start="263.32" dur="5.58">rate the further your money goes or I</text>
  <text start="266.8" dur="3.39">should say currency goes you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="268.9" dur="3.48">to make that much if the interest rates</text>
  <text start="270.19" dur="4.68">come down if the interest rates move up</text>
  <text start="272.38" dur="4.11">and you&amp;#39;re making the same salary it</text>
  <text start="274.87" dur="3.81">bumps you out of the market you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="276.49" dur="3.81">afford the house that you want and then</text>
  <text start="278.68" dur="3.66">you have to look for a less expensive</text>
  <text start="280.3" dur="3.3">house and many people say well I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="282.34" dur="3.66">going to do this because this is not</text>
  <text start="283.6" dur="4.05">what I want and as the interest rates</text>
  <text start="286" dur="3.36">continually move up it continually</text>
  <text start="287.65" dur="3.54">pushes people out of that market and</text>
  <text start="289.36" dur="4.32">brings them down to the next level this</text>
  <text start="291.19" dur="4.35">is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now as the</text>
  <text start="293.68" dur="5.58">rates move up we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="295.54" dur="7.23">everything completely break down I mean</text>
  <text start="299.26" dur="6.39">if we look at us home refinancing it has</text>
  <text start="302.77" dur="7.05">fallen to the lowest level since 2000</text>
  <text start="305.65" dur="6.93">that is December 2000 we see refinancing</text>
  <text start="309.82" dur="6.36">fell on existing homes by 5.9 percent</text>
  <text start="312.58" dur="7.53">and if and I think or I should say when</text>
  <text start="316.18" dur="4.59">when the Fed decides to raise the rates</text>
  <text start="320.11" dur="4.7">again</text>
  <text start="320.77" dur="7.019">September we&amp;#39;re going to see refinancing</text>
  <text start="324.81" dur="5.65">existing home purchases new home</text>
  <text start="327.789" dur="4.891">purchases fall to levels like we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="330.46" dur="6.389">never seen before and it&amp;#39;s going to hit</text>
  <text start="332.68" dur="6.209">every single market in the u.s. those</text>
  <text start="336.849" dur="3.991">markets that are seeing you know prices</text>
  <text start="338.889" dur="2.941">hit an all-time high and people saying</text>
  <text start="340.84" dur="2.88">everything was great</text>
  <text start="341.83" dur="5.01">remember they were saying this back</text>
  <text start="343.72" dur="5.909">prior to 2008 2009 and everything came</text>
  <text start="346.84" dur="4.56">crashing down now the central banks they</text>
  <text start="349.629" dur="4.051">realize and we discussed as many times</text>
  <text start="351.4" dur="4.199">before that this economy cannot continue</text>
  <text start="353.68" dur="4.019">like this remember they didn&amp;#39;t plan it</text>
  <text start="355.599" dur="4.41">they didn&amp;#39;t plan on this economy to go</text>
  <text start="357.699" dur="5.011">this long they thought we would be in an</text>
  <text start="360.009" dur="4.051">event right now a war it&amp;#39;d be very easy</text>
  <text start="362.71" dur="3.269">to cover it up and this is what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="364.06" dur="3.419">done in the past they thought they were</text>
  <text start="365.979" dur="3.361">gonna have someone else in office and</text>
  <text start="367.479" dur="4.111">this way they could say listen everyone</text>
  <text start="369.34" dur="3.569">has to sacrifice we&amp;#39;re at war this is</text>
  <text start="371.59" dur="2.879">why you&amp;#39;re not seeing groceries on the</text>
  <text start="372.909" dur="4.201">shelves this is why it&amp;#39;s hard to get</text>
  <text start="374.469" dur="4.221">fuel and we could see that the economy</text>
  <text start="377.11" dur="6.059">is not doing well because everything has</text>
  <text start="378.69" dur="5.83">maneuvered to wartime manufacturing the</text>
  <text start="383.169" dur="3.511">wait a minute we don&amp;#39;t have that much</text>
  <text start="384.52" dur="4.47">manufacturing here so the economy would</text>
  <text start="386.68" dur="4.079">hurt even further and also it&amp;#39;ll give</text>
  <text start="388.99" dur="3.78">the excuse of the central bankers to</text>
  <text start="390.759" dur="2.541">create currency like there was no</text>
  <text start="392.77" dur="2.85">tomorrow</text>
  <text start="393.3" dur="4.39">well they don&amp;#39;t have any of that right</text>
  <text start="395.62" dur="3.87">now and they&amp;#39;re scrambling right now</text>
  <text start="397.69" dur="5.039">because they know what&amp;#39;s coming they</text>
  <text start="399.49" dur="5.669">understand that this system is going to</text>
  <text start="402.729" dur="4.021">implode any minute and the way Trump and</text>
  <text start="405.159" dur="3.901">the Patriots have set this up they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="406.75" dur="5.909">getting ready to blame the central bank</text>
  <text start="409.06" dur="6.03">blame the deep state and reset</text>
  <text start="412.659" dur="5.25">everything so the central bank&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="415.09" dur="4.949">still in the same agenda they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="417.909" dur="4.711">changed because they do believe that</text>
  <text start="420.039" dur="4.801">they will be in control moving forward</text>
  <text start="422.62" dur="4.349">they never think that they&amp;#39;ll ever lose</text>
  <text start="424.84" dur="3.78">control because they&amp;#39;re always thinking</text>
  <text start="426.969" dur="4.44">of the next thing that they can do to</text>
  <text start="428.62" dur="5.25">regain control and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="431.409" dur="4.581">doing so right now we know that</text>
  <text start="433.87" dur="4.5">throughout the world they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="435.99" dur="4.72">experimenting with all different things</text>
  <text start="438.37" dur="4.979">like universal basic income where they</text>
  <text start="440.71" dur="4.35">shut down the banks also where they had</text>
  <text start="443.349" dur="4.32">bail-ins they&amp;#39;ve been trying all</text>
  <text start="445.06" dur="4.889">different things well it&amp;#39;s the u.s. the</text>
  <text start="447.669" dur="4.261">US has turned now they&amp;#39;re going to test</text>
  <text start="449.949" dur="4.771">something here and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="451.93" dur="6.33">tested in Chicago and we know that Rahm</text>
  <text start="454.72" dur="5.94">he&amp;#39;s not seeking to look for another</text>
  <text start="458.26" dur="5.91">term he&amp;#39;s going to leave his position</text>
  <text start="460.66" dur="5.13">but he&amp;#39;s creating this task force that</text>
  <text start="464.17" dur="5.01">will analyze whether the city should</text>
  <text start="465.79" dur="6">establish a so-called universal basic</text>
  <text start="469.18" dur="4.62">income program now this is very</text>
  <text start="471.79" dur="3">interesting we know that Chicago is a</text>
  <text start="473.8" dur="4.11">disaster</text>
  <text start="474.79" dur="6.48">high crime the pension system is a</text>
  <text start="477.91" dur="5.79">completely broken it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s unfixable</text>
  <text start="481.27" dur="6.66">right now the city has many many</text>
  <text start="483.7" dur="6.87">problems but to keep everyone happy to</text>
  <text start="487.93" dur="5.82">make sure that this universal basic</text>
  <text start="490.57" dur="4.98">income system works they need to test it</text>
  <text start="493.75" dur="3.84">out and they tried this in many</text>
  <text start="495.55" dur="5.67">different areas around the world and the</text>
  <text start="497.59" dur="6.24">u.s. is now on the list now it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="501.22" dur="8.64">really Rahm Emmanuel&amp;#39;s idea it was first</text>
  <text start="503.83" dur="8.16">floated by Chicago alderman Amy Pawar</text>
  <text start="509.86" dur="5.01">who is running for the governor of</text>
  <text start="511.99" dur="5.7">Illinois this November and he called on</text>
  <text start="514.87" dur="5.78">Emanuel to launch a pilot program which</text>
  <text start="517.69" dur="8.16">pit which would pay a thousand families</text>
  <text start="520.65" dur="7.45">$500 each month to keep people happy and</text>
  <text start="525.85" dur="5.52">then they&amp;#39;re going to expand that to</text>
  <text start="528.1" dur="5.52">more families and maybe even raise the</text>
  <text start="531.37" dur="4.59">monthly amount now $500 a month if</text>
  <text start="533.62" dur="4.05">you&amp;#39;re thinking about this it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="535.96" dur="4.14">not that much I mean think about it if</text>
  <text start="537.67" dur="4.53">you&amp;#39;re living in an apartment your rent</text>
  <text start="540.1" dur="4.62">is going to be what three four five six</text>
  <text start="542.2" dur="4.92">hundred maybe even more than that so yes</text>
  <text start="544.72" dur="5.49">maybe this will help you pay for that</text>
  <text start="547.12" dur="4.41">apartment but anything else it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="550.21" dur="3.12">going to come out of your own pocket so</text>
  <text start="551.53" dur="3.3">eventually what we&amp;#39;re going to say is</text>
  <text start="553.33" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re going to probably see this amount</text>
  <text start="554.83" dur="5.1">move up because they&amp;#39;re gonna start to</text>
  <text start="556.93" dur="4.89">realize that it was okay but we need to</text>
  <text start="559.93" dur="3.75">give them more now they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="561.82" dur="4.05">because they want to keep people happy</text>
  <text start="563.68" dur="3.69">remember the central bank they want</text>
  <text start="565.87" dur="3.81">people dependent on the central bank</text>
  <text start="567.37" dur="5.6">they want people dependent on government</text>
  <text start="569.68" dur="6.75">they want people dependent and not</text>
  <text start="572.97" dur="5.53">independent and this is part of their</text>
  <text start="576.43" dur="4.47">plan to keep everyone happy because when</text>
  <text start="578.5" dur="4.29">this system comes down they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="580.9" dur="4.14">people pointing to the central bank to</text>
  <text start="582.79" dur="3.48">blame the central bank for the economy</text>
  <text start="585.04" dur="3.539">crashing but I think it&amp;#39;s a little too</text>
  <text start="586.27" dur="4.71">late right now I believe a</text>
  <text start="588.579" dur="4.771">- a while ago and they were testing it</text>
  <text start="590.98" dur="4.079">out but I think at this point people are</text>
  <text start="593.35" dur="3.539">going to realize because it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="595.059" dur="4.53">be pointed out that it was the central</text>
  <text start="596.889" dur="5.91">bank that was the problem and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="599.589" dur="4.74">already seeing the narratives of the Fed</text>
  <text start="602.799" dur="2.58">bringing down the economy because they</text>
  <text start="604.329" dur="1.98">were raising the interest rates and of</text>
  <text start="605.379" dur="2.041">course what they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="606.309" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re going to march economists out</text>
  <text start="607.42" dur="4.139">there and they&amp;#39;re going to show you how</text>
  <text start="610.059" dur="3.541">the Fed actually brought down the</text>
  <text start="611.559" dur="3.81">economy it&amp;#39;s very easy to do I mean all</text>
  <text start="613.6" dur="5.159">you have to do is go back in time and go</text>
  <text start="615.369" dur="5.31">to 2006 7 and then 2008 show how the</text>
  <text start="618.759" dur="3.39">interest rates went up show how</text>

  <text start="625.72" dur="4.44">to implode on itself all they have to do</text>
  <text start="628.179" dur="3.78">is do the same exact thing and then show</text>
  <text start="630.16" dur="3.929">how all of a sudden it as everything</text>
  <text start="631.959" dur="3.651">started to collapse they started to low</text>
  <text start="634.089" dur="4.44">the lower the interest rates in</text>
  <text start="635.61" dur="6.49">2008-2009 came down straight down like</text>
  <text start="638.529" dur="5.97">an elevator that got its cables cut and</text>
  <text start="642.1" dur="4.109">the elevator just fell</text>
  <text start="644.499" dur="4.111">they brought the interest rates down and</text>
  <text start="646.209" dur="5.13">we know that most of the central banks</text>
  <text start="648.61" dur="4.769">around the world they can&amp;#39;t really raise</text>
  <text start="651.339" dur="4.021">interest rates because they know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="653.379" dur="4.65">going to implode the entire economic</text>

  <text start="667.569" dur="2.61">the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re becoming</text>
  <text start="669.069" dur="2.971">very nervous because they&amp;#39;re saying hey</text>
  <text start="670.179" dur="4.111">listen fed don&amp;#39;t raise the interest</text>
  <text start="672.04" dur="4.799">rates anymore this is it this should be</text>
  <text start="674.29" dur="4.44">the last one they were doing this very</text>
  <text start="676.839" dur="3.84">very quickly and I remember going back a</text>
  <text start="678.73" dur="3.779">year ago they were all for it let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="680.679" dur="3.931">raise it let&amp;#39;s keep raising it because</text>
  <text start="682.509" dur="5.25">they knew that this was going to be</text>
  <text start="684.61" dur="6.149">blamed on Trump now everything has been</text>
  <text start="687.759" dur="6.51">turned around Trump has the magic wand</text>
  <text start="690.759" dur="5.04">this was his tweet to Obama because</text>
  <text start="694.269" dur="3.891">Obama said it would take a magic wand to</text>
  <text start="695.799" dur="4.801">make the economy do a lot better and</text>
  <text start="698.16" dur="4.539">Trump says well I have the magic wand</text>
  <text start="700.6" dur="4.349">and we&amp;#39;re gonna do much better which</text>
  <text start="702.699" dur="4.83">means he has control over the</text>
  <text start="704.949" dur="4.5">manipulation of all these numbers he can</text>
  <text start="707.529" dur="4.321">control it and make it look like any way</text>
  <text start="709.449" dur="4.651">he wanted to just like they&amp;#39;ve done in</text>
  <text start="711.85" dur="4.349">the past he has control most likely over</text>
  <text start="714.1" dur="5.459">the Fed because Powell I do believe is</text>
  <text start="716.199" dur="4.86">working with him so we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="719.559" dur="2.341">going through this transition and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="721.059" dur="3.661">seeing a</text>
  <text start="721.9" dur="3.99">perfect storm hit think about all the</text>
  <text start="724.72" dur="3.18">things that are happening right now the</text>
  <text start="725.89" dur="4.5">economy is declining very very quickly</text>
  <text start="727.9" dur="5.25">if you look past the unemployment</text>
  <text start="730.39" dur="4.02">numbers GDP numbers and stock market</text>
  <text start="733.15" dur="3.48">numbers which really don&amp;#39;t give you a</text>
  <text start="734.41" dur="4.77">gauge of how the economy&amp;#39;s doing if you</text>
  <text start="736.63" dur="3.75">look past that you can see all the</text>
  <text start="739.18" dur="2.7">different cracks and how things are</text>
  <text start="740.38" dur="4.97">starting to fall apart very very quickly</text>
  <text start="741.88" dur="8.16">and we also have the release of</text>
  <text start="745.35" dur="6.73">corruption and spying on a president a</text>
  <text start="750.04" dur="3.72">sitting president was spying on a</text>
  <text start="752.08" dur="4.35">president that was coming into office</text>
  <text start="753.76" dur="5.67">and we could see there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="756.43" dur="6.21">corruption within this entire group when</text>
  <text start="759.43" dur="8.22">all this hits and more truth comes out</text>
  <text start="762.64" dur="6.84">this is the perfect storm and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="767.65" dur="3.48">going to be easy for a lot of people</text>
  <text start="769.48" dur="2.76">because people have not been preparing</text>
  <text start="771.13" dur="4.26">for this I mean think about the</text>
  <text start="772.24" dur="5.91">hurricane right now if you know anyone</text>
  <text start="775.39" dur="4.05">in the South Carolina Carolina area you</text>
  <text start="778.15" dur="3.48">know like the store shelves are</text>
  <text start="779.44" dur="4.41">completely empty people are evacuating</text>
  <text start="781.63" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s no batteries there&amp;#39;s no fuel</text>
  <text start="783.85" dur="4.41">people were on line for fuel miles and</text>
  <text start="786.13" dur="4.11">miles back when they got to the pump</text>
  <text start="788.26" dur="3.81">there was absolutely nothing think about</text>
  <text start="790.24" dur="3.54">when we go through this transition and</text>
  <text start="792.07" dur="3.87">yes in the beginning stages it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="793.78" dur="3.54">to be bumpy you think everyone&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="795.94" dur="3.06">gonna be sitting there going hey what</text>
  <text start="797.32" dur="2.55">should i do I don&amp;#39;t know what to do know</text>
  <text start="799" dur="2.67">they&amp;#39;re gonna be running to the</text>
  <text start="799.87" dur="3.24">supermarket they&amp;#39;re gonna be running to</text>
  <text start="801.67" dur="2.94">the gas station they&amp;#39;re gonna be trying</text>
  <text start="803.11" dur="4.05">to get whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="804.61" dur="4.59">especially if inflation hits because as</text>
  <text start="807.16" dur="5.88">inflation hits the value of the dollar</text>
  <text start="809.2" dur="7.08">decreases every single day in some cases</text>
  <text start="813.04" dur="5.04">every single hour and they know if they</text>
  <text start="816.28" dur="4.05">don&amp;#39;t go now to get these supplies they</text>
  <text start="818.08" dur="4.86">won&amp;#39;t have enough later on to get them</text>
  <text start="820.33" dur="4.11">and most likely they will not be able to</text>
  <text start="822.94" dur="4.11">get them because credit will freeze up</text>
  <text start="824.44" dur="4.02">at this time so we&amp;#39;re going to be going</text>
  <text start="827.05" dur="2.67">through this transition just like we</text>
  <text start="828.46" dur="3.27">went through a transition back in the</text>
  <text start="829.72" dur="3.39">70s it&amp;#39;s going to be a little rough in</text>
  <text start="831.73" dur="2.73">the beginning and remember we were</text>
  <text start="833.11" dur="3.15">coming off the gold standard we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="834.46" dur="5.1">have that much debt and we&amp;#39;re moving on</text>
  <text start="836.26" dur="5.91">to the oil based system and we still had</text>
  <text start="839.56" dur="5.61">problems now we&amp;#39;re coming off a system</text>
  <text start="842.17" dur="4.74">where we have a huge amount of debt it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="845.17" dur="3.78">based on nothing the middle east has</text>
  <text start="846.91" dur="4.53">taken back their countries they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="848.95" dur="4.38">trade outside of the dollar most of the</text>
  <text start="851.44" dur="2.87">countries are right now and we&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="853.33" dur="3.47">moving away</text>
  <text start="854.31" dur="5.27">from the reserve currency in this</text>
  <text start="856.8" dur="5.61">country to another currency and</text>
  <text start="859.58" dur="4.44">hopefully we have gold left most likely</text>
  <text start="862.41" dur="5.27">many people think that we have nothing</text>
  <text start="864.02" dur="6.13">nothing left and if we have nothing left</text>
  <text start="867.68" dur="5.62">there&amp;#39;s going to be huge problems here</text>
  <text start="870.15" dur="4.74">in the US and remember this is because</text>
  <text start="873.3" dur="4.44">of the central bankers the deep state</text>
  <text start="874.89" dur="5.04">over the many many years preparing this</text>
  <text start="877.74" dur="5.76">country for something completely</text>
  <text start="879.93" dur="5.67">different and now it has to be prepared</text>
  <text start="883.5" dur="4.32">for something different than they were</text>
  <text start="885.6" dur="3.84">preparing for and it&amp;#39;s very difficult to</text>
  <text start="887.82" dur="3.87">do because we&amp;#39;re at the end stages right</text>
  <text start="889.44" dur="3.81">now and they know we&amp;#39;re at the end stage</text>
  <text start="891.69" dur="2.67">right now and it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="893.25" dur="3">difficult and this is why it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="894.36" dur="5.04">be very bumpy this is why you need to be</text>
  <text start="896.25" dur="7.11">prepared for what is coming because once</text>
  <text start="899.4" dur="6.12">we start this transition and you will</text>
  <text start="903.36" dur="4.56">notice it when we start you&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="905.52" dur="5.04">strange things happening the market fall</text>
  <text start="907.92" dur="4.95">you&amp;#39;ll see unemployment the numbers</text>
  <text start="910.56" dur="5.76">won&amp;#39;t make sense anymore you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="912.87" dur="4.86">stores closing people will be running to</text>
  <text start="916.32" dur="2.88">the supermarket I mean this is all not</text>
  <text start="917.73" dur="4.38">gonna happen at the same time most</text>
  <text start="919.2" dur="4.98">likely you&amp;#39;ll see you&amp;#39;ll hear news of</text>
  <text start="922.11" dur="4.05">businesses that can&amp;#39;t make it anymore</text>
  <text start="924.18" dur="4.07">like Toys R Us and things like that</text>
  <text start="926.16" dur="5.46">you&amp;#39;ll hear of businesses that are</text>
  <text start="928.25" dur="6.16">failing and they can&amp;#39;t keep going major</text>
  <text start="931.62" dur="3.26">corporations they will start to layoff</text>
  <text start="934.41" dur="4.29">people</text>
  <text start="934.88" dur="5.92">the market will start to come down banks</text>
  <text start="938.7" dur="3.78">will get into trouble because the</text>
  <text start="940.8" dur="4.23">central bank the Fed doesn&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="942.48" dur="5.46">ability to create currency like they did</text>
  <text start="945.03" dur="4.62">before it was taken away from them and</text>
  <text start="947.94" dur="4.02">this is why you have Geithner and</text>
  <text start="949.65" dur="4.35">Bernanke and other former feds saying</text>
  <text start="951.96" dur="3.18">listen maybe they should have maybe the</text>
  <text start="954" dur="3.089">Fed should have the ability to buy</text>
  <text start="955.14" dur="3.569">stocks because they know banks have been</text>
  <text start="957.089" dur="2.941">buying back their stocks corporations</text>
  <text start="958.709" dur="3.061">I&amp;#39;ve been buying back their stocks and</text>
  <text start="960.03" dur="4.2">when the stock market Falls guess what</text>
  <text start="961.77" dur="3.54">happens they&amp;#39;re in a lot of trouble so</text>
  <text start="964.23" dur="3">we&amp;#39;re gonna be going through this</text>
  <text start="965.31" dur="3.75">transition and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="967.23" dur="3.84">difficult for some those people who are</text>
  <text start="969.06" dur="3.36">not prepared those people don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="971.07" dur="3.15">realize what&amp;#39;s going to happen those</text>
  <text start="972.42" dur="3.78">people that think the dollar is king</text>
  <text start="974.22" dur="5.489">will always be king they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="976.2" dur="5.34">for in for a rude awakening because the</text>
  <text start="979.709" dur="3.811">dollar is really a Federal Reserve Note</text>
  <text start="981.54" dur="4.049">this was created by the central bank</text>
  <text start="983.52" dur="4.04">this is not people&amp;#39;s money this is a</text>
  <text start="985.589" dur="4.791">central bank debt note</text>
  <text start="987.56" dur="4.89">and this has to be discontinued the</text>
  <text start="990.38" dur="4.77">central bank has to be discontinued and</text>
  <text start="992.45" dur="4.89">when it does we need to transition into</text>
  <text start="995.15" dur="3.81">something else this is going to be the</text>
  <text start="997.34" dur="3.27">bumpy part of it where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="998.96" dur="4.319">transitioning into something else</text>
  <text start="1000.61" dur="5.729">because remember everyone&amp;#39;s lives were</text>
  <text start="1003.279" dur="5.551">revolving around this debt note and now</text>
  <text start="1006.339" dur="4.201">this debt note no longer exists and for</text>
  <text start="1008.83" dur="3.509">those people that are still holding on</text>
  <text start="1010.54" dur="3.84">to this debt note most likely they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1012.339" dur="4.351">gonna get pennies on the dollar as they</text>
  <text start="1014.38" dur="4.23">transition into the new currency those</text>
  <text start="1016.69" dur="3.6">people that are holding gold silver</text>
  <text start="1018.61" dur="4.41">maybe even crypto currencies I know that</text>
  <text start="1020.29" dur="4.23">is dropped but remember this is from the</text>
  <text start="1023.02" dur="4.2">central bank just like gold and silver</text>
  <text start="1024.52" dur="4.559">has dropped also if you notice they</text>
  <text start="1027.22" dur="4.349">continually suppress everything that</text>
  <text start="1029.079" dur="4.74">goes against their system they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1031.569" dur="3.661">want people looking at that think about</text>
  <text start="1033.819" dur="2.671">what&amp;#39;s going to happen gold and silver</text>
  <text start="1035.23" dur="3.99">has been around for thousands upon</text>
  <text start="1036.49" dur="5.459">thousands of years and if the debt note</text>
  <text start="1039.22" dur="4.41">goes away guess what happens the</text>
  <text start="1041.949" dur="3.75">manipulation goes away if the</text>
  <text start="1043.63" dur="3.51">manipulation goes away what do you think</text>
  <text start="1045.699" dur="2.521">gold and silver is gonna go to what do</text>
  <text start="1047.14" dur="3.51">you think the cryptocurrencies are gonna</text>
  <text start="1048.22" dur="5.13">go to they&amp;#39;re going to start to move up</text>
  <text start="1050.65" dur="4.08">and people are going to realize this and</text>
  <text start="1053.35" dur="3.65">then people are gonna try to get it and</text>
