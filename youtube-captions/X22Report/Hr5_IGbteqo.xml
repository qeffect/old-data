  <text start="77.44" dur="7.929">the way the US government acts the way</text>
  <text start="81.5" dur="7.5">most of the politicians act the way the</text>
  <text start="85.369" dur="7.741">laws are the rule of law has completely</text>
  <text start="89" dur="6.44">changed there&amp;#39;s one set of rules for the</text>
  <text start="93.11" dur="5.85">elite there&amp;#39;s another set of rules for</text>
  <text start="95.44" dur="8.86">the serfs so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="98.96" dur="11.79">is a change in America and this change</text>
  <text start="104.3" dur="9.84">is not for the good because what is</text>
  <text start="110.75" dur="5.88">happening right now in America is the US</text>
  <text start="114.14" dur="8.76">government central bankers they have</text>
  <text start="116.63" dur="9">been preparing prepping the US for this</text>
  <text start="122.9" dur="4.44">change and people are thinking to</text>
  <text start="125.63" dur="4.68">themselves well what do you mean this</text>
  <text start="127.34" dur="5.869">change well think about where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="130.31" dur="6.45">headed right now we&amp;#39;re headed into a</text>
  <text start="133.209" dur="5.981">period of time where the United States</text>
  <text start="136.76" dur="5.13">government central bankers are looking</text>
  <text start="139.19" dur="5.549">to push war because the entire economic</text>
  <text start="141.89" dur="6.06">system is coming down they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="144.739" dur="4.711">pushing for many years to remove weapons</text>
  <text start="147.95" dur="4.08">from the people because they know a</text>
  <text start="149.45" dur="4.44">population that do not have weapons they</text>
  <text start="152.03" dur="3.39">can&amp;#39;t defend themselves this is proven</text>
  <text start="153.89" dur="5.129">over time in many many different</text>
  <text start="155.42" dur="8.58">countries they&amp;#39;ve been also creating</text>
  <text start="159.019" dur="9.541">educational systems called Common Core</text>
  <text start="164" dur="6.989">in the united states where they pushed</text>
  <text start="168.56" dur="6.929">the common core educational system on</text>
  <text start="170.989" dur="8.971">the states by first introducing grants</text>
  <text start="175.489" dur="6.991">and money to the states</text>
  <text start="179.96" dur="6.03">and there were preconditions if you</text>
  <text start="182.48" dur="7.41">accept the federal money you must then</text>
  <text start="185.99" dur="6.51">accept common core and of course the</text>
  <text start="189.89" dur="5.87">state said well if it&amp;#39;s common core of</text>
  <text start="192.5" dur="5.4">course we&amp;#39;ll accept that it sounds great</text>
  <text start="195.76" dur="5.44">well of course we know what the US</text>
  <text start="197.9" dur="6.03">government does any bill or any program</text>
  <text start="201.2" dur="5.25">they create they pick out a really great</text>
  <text start="203.93" dur="5.22">title to make it sound like it&amp;#39;s working</text>
  <text start="206.45" dur="4.92">for the people the Affordable Care Act</text>
  <text start="209.15" dur="5.91">does it really seem that affordable</text>
  <text start="211.37" dur="7.92">anymore the Patriot Act is it really for</text>
  <text start="215.06" dur="8.19">the Patriots know when you hear these</text>
  <text start="219.29" dur="6.81">things it&amp;#39;s always the opposite of what</text>
  <text start="223.25" dur="7.73">they really are and this common core is</text>
  <text start="226.1" dur="9.21">to train and educate our next generation</text>
  <text start="230.98" dur="8.95">to be good citizens and to do whatever</text>
  <text start="235.31" dur="8.04">the government wants that&amp;#39;s why in</text>
  <text start="239.93" dur="6.09">common core they are trying to convince</text>
  <text start="243.35" dur="6.48">the young that the rights or privileges</text>
  <text start="246.02" dur="6.72">they rewrote a lot of the rights in the</text>
  <text start="249.83" dur="6.87">way the government wants to explain them</text>
  <text start="252.74" dur="7.249">and we can see right now that America is</text>
  <text start="256.7" dur="6.15">going to change because after the war</text>
  <text start="259.989" dur="4.061">these central bankers these elite the</text>
  <text start="262.85" dur="4.59">globalists whatever you like to call</text>
  <text start="264.05" dur="5.34">them they do believe that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="267.44" dur="4.05">to restart this entire system all over</text>
  <text start="269.39" dur="5.07">and they&amp;#39;d rather get rid of all these</text>
  <text start="271.49" dur="4.76">rights and the Constitution is just it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="274.46" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s really a big problem for them</text>
  <text start="276.25" dur="4.12">because they can&amp;#39;t control the people</text>
  <text start="278.36" dur="4.41">they wait the way they want they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="280.37" dur="4.71">have people having rights that&amp;#39;s why the</text>
  <text start="282.77" dur="5.1">founding fathers decided to do this</text>
  <text start="285.08" dur="6.27">because they realized without this the</text>
  <text start="287.87" dur="7.1">people are doomed so we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="291.35" dur="8.19">going through this incredible change in</text>
  <text start="294.97" dur="6.97">America unless it&amp;#39;s stopped and we can</text>
  <text start="299.54" dur="5.64">see by what the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="301.94" dur="5.13">doing right now they&amp;#39;ve been preparing</text>
  <text start="305.18" dur="5.04">and prepping for this situation for</text>
  <text start="307.07" dur="5.13">quite a while because they knew</text>
  <text start="310.22" dur="3.15">eventually that this economic system</text>
  <text start="312.2" dur="3.51">would die they</text>
  <text start="313.37" dur="6.21">you eventually that they would push war</text>
  <text start="315.71" dur="9.09">and they knew eventually when all said</text>
  <text start="319.58" dur="9.69">and done America would have to adapt to</text>
  <text start="324.8" dur="8.31">a new set of rules and this is what</text>
  <text start="329.27" dur="7.14">they&amp;#39;ve been getting the entire country</text>
  <text start="333.11" dur="8.52">ready for and if we don&amp;#39;t want this to</text>
  <text start="336.41" dur="10.8">happen we as a people once again need to</text>
  <text start="341.63" dur="8.31">come together and fight for the country</text>
  <text start="347.21" dur="4.679">that we once knew of because when we</text>
  <text start="349.94" dur="5.31">listen to our founding fathers we read</text>
  <text start="351.889" dur="5.731">their writings we know that what they</text>
  <text start="355.25" dur="4.8">gave us was only going to last for a</text>
  <text start="357.62" dur="5.51">certain period of time and we were going</text>
  <text start="360.05" dur="6.39">to have to fight for what they set up</text>
  <text start="363.13" dur="9.099">once again and we&amp;#39;re coming to that</text>
  <text start="366.44" dur="8.22">point and we know that the powers at bay</text>
  <text start="372.229" dur="4.111">the federal government they have been</text>
  <text start="374.66" dur="4.439">infiltrating the local police</text>
  <text start="376.34" dur="6.299">departments giving them military</text>
  <text start="379.099" dur="6.421">equipment giving them federal grants</text>
  <text start="382.639" dur="4.59">federal money this way they have to</text>
  <text start="385.52" dur="4.59">report back to the federal government</text>
  <text start="387.229" dur="7.231">basically they&amp;#39;ve been federalized and</text>
  <text start="390.11" dur="11">we can see right now that they will use</text>
  <text start="394.46" dur="10.26">these local forces to lock down America</text>
  <text start="401.11" dur="6.58">because you have to remember there was a</text>
  <text start="404.72" dur="5.55">House bill called 1328 and it went into</text>
  <text start="407.69" dur="5.31">effect August first and the original</text>
  <text start="410.27" dur="5.34">piece of legislation was to ensure</text>
  <text start="413" dur="4.789">police obtained a search warrant to use</text>
  <text start="415.61" dur="6.48">a drone to gather criminal evidence</text>
  <text start="417.789" dur="6.701">however when a lobbyist with a police</text>
  <text start="422.09" dur="4.17">ties was allowed to amend the bill it</text>
  <text start="424.49" dur="5.429">was rewritten to specify that drones</text>
  <text start="426.26" dur="7.67">could carry anything except weapons</text>
  <text start="429.919" dur="7.921">capable of lethal force until the year</text>
  <text start="433.93" dur="10.73">2017 when the police will be able to fly</text>
  <text start="437.84" dur="9.52">weaponized drones so the reason why the</text>
  <text start="444.66" dur="5.49">federal government was out there telling</text>
  <text start="447.36" dur="5.73">individuals they can&amp;#39;t fly drones why</text>
  <text start="450.15" dur="7.14">you had to get licensed because they</text>
  <text start="453.09" dur="6.69">don&amp;#39;t want you having the same tools the</text>
  <text start="457.29" dur="6.18">same weapons they have just like they</text>
  <text start="459.78" dur="7.05">don&amp;#39;t want you to have a weapon because</text>
  <text start="463.47" dur="7.16">think about it a drone flying around in</text>
  <text start="466.83" dur="7.88">the air with a weapon attached to it</text>
  <text start="470.63" dur="7.54">very very dangerous very effective and</text>
  <text start="474.71" dur="7.69">we can see right now that they are</text>
  <text start="478.17" dur="6.99">prepared and ready to control the</text>
  <text start="482.4" dur="4.62">population when this system comes down</text>
  <text start="485.16" dur="5.85">and they know they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="487.02" dur="5.43">control the people they know that once</text>
  <text start="491.01" dur="5.49">the system comes down there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="492.45" dur="6.33">be a many many angry people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="496.5" dur="4.92">hoping to cover this up with war to</text>
  <text start="498.78" dur="4.86">distract everyone but we have to see</text>
  <text start="501.42" dur="3.9">what the timings going to be there</text>
  <text start="503.64" dur="4.53">trying to do their best to get war</text>
  <text start="505.32" dur="7.95">started but again their plans don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="508.17" dur="7.35">always go as planned because look at the</text>
  <text start="513.27" dur="4.949">Middle East they thought they were going</text>
  <text start="515.52" dur="7.23">to have all these countries all lined up</text>
  <text start="518.219" dur="6.571">with puppet governments by 2008 it</text>
  <text start="522.75" dur="5.54">didn&amp;#39;t happen actually they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="524.79" dur="8.16">the countries now they&amp;#39;re going back in</text>
  <text start="528.29" dur="9.16">to fight the same people the people who</text>
  <text start="532.95" dur="8.19">want their countries back so we see</text>
  <text start="537.45" dur="7.14">right now we do have a chance we have a</text>
  <text start="541.14" dur="7.14">window of opportunity to band together</text>
  <text start="544.59" dur="6.18">to come together as a people and to</text>
  <text start="548.28" dur="6.27">change things and we need to go to the</text>
  <text start="550.77" dur="6.02">root of the problem and these two</text>
  <text start="554.55" dur="4.65">candidates that are running right now</text>
  <text start="556.79" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s really meaningless because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="559.2" dur="4.38">not going to be in control their puppets</text>
  <text start="560.87" dur="4.33">yes one might take orders better than</text>
  <text start="563.58" dur="3.33">the other from the shadow government</text>
  <text start="565.2" dur="4.97">from the elite from the central bankers</text>
  <text start="566.91" dur="8.73">but if you do not cut off the head of</text>
  <text start="570.17" dur="6.76">the snake guess what it will make a</text>
  <text start="575.64" dur="2.699">difference</text>
  <text start="576.93" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;ll just get rid of the puppet they</text>
  <text start="578.339" dur="7.44">don&amp;#39;t want and put in a puppet they do</text>
  <text start="581.37" dur="6.81">want now we have noticed that the war</text>
  <text start="585.779" dur="5.221">drums have been beating louder and</text>
  <text start="588.18" dur="6.81">louder and louder the corporate media is</text>
  <text start="591" dur="6.75">even talking about war they have some uh</text>
  <text start="594.99" dur="4.92">pet articles I think in the New York</text>
  <text start="597.75" dur="4.2">Times and other places where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="599.91" dur="5.429">talking about Warren how it would be</text>
  <text start="601.95" dur="7.829">good to have some type of war and we see</text>
  <text start="605.339" dur="6.901">many countries are preparing India just</text>
  <text start="609.779" dur="5.101">signed an agreement with Russia to get</text>
  <text start="612.24" dur="5.07">the s400 missile system supplied to them</text>
  <text start="614.88" dur="5.7">we see Russia complete the deal with</text>
  <text start="617.31" dur="6.18">Iran to receive the rest of the s-300</text>
  <text start="620.58" dur="6.78">air defense system we see out in the</text>
  <text start="623.49" dur="7.289">Philippines Rodrigo Duterte said you</text>
  <text start="627.36" dur="7.169">know something I&amp;#39;ve had it US forces</text>
  <text start="630.779" dur="4.891">need to leave the country now and we can</text>
  <text start="634.529" dur="4.141">see right now that the United States</text>
  <text start="635.67" dur="4.77">government central bankers they want the</text>
  <text start="638.67" dur="5.01">Philippines it&amp;#39;s part of their strategic</text>
  <text start="640.44" dur="4.89">location to encircle China and what</text>
  <text start="643.68" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is countries now</text>
  <text start="645.33" dur="5.64">are taking sides and we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot</text>
  <text start="647.94" dur="5.07">of countries reacting to what is about</text>
  <text start="650.97" dur="4.44">to happen here because we can see the</text>
  <text start="653.01" dur="5.34">United States right now they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="655.41" dur="8.22">going to let up they might talk peace</text>
  <text start="658.35" dur="9.45">they might you know point fingers use</text>
  <text start="663.63" dur="8.13">propaganda but they will never give up</text>
  <text start="667.8" dur="7.289">on their goal to start this war the</text>
  <text start="671.76" dur="8.25">system is coming down we see the US Air</text>
  <text start="675.089" dur="8.101">Force has the f-16 and kc-135s they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="680.01" dur="6.99">been deployed back in July to Djibouti</text>
  <text start="683.19" dur="6.3">and we can see they are on standby right</text>
  <text start="687" dur="6.87">now because of what is happening in</text>
  <text start="689.49" dur="9.95">Sudan Libya Yemen Iraq Lebanon Syria and</text>
  <text start="693.87" dur="10.14">Russia so we&amp;#39;re already the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="699.44" dur="7.75">increasing the level of readiness to</text>
  <text start="704.01" dur="6.96">launch planes into different areas when</text>
  <text start="707.19" dur="7.53">needed we see representative</text>
  <text start="710.97" dur="7.59">Lou a former lawyer in the US Air Force</text>
  <text start="714.72" dur="8.34">urged Obama to suspend all arms sales to</text>
  <text start="718.56" dur="13.139">Saudi Arabia because of the war crimes</text>
  <text start="723.06" dur="11.79">of Saudi Arabia inflicting death on the</text>
  <text start="731.699" dur="5.041">Yemeni people and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="734.85" dur="5.159">that the United States government</text>
  <text start="736.74" dur="8.88">central bankers they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="740.009" dur="8.01">that their whole mission is who cares</text>
  <text start="745.62" dur="5.089">about the people get the puppet</text>
  <text start="748.019" dur="6.3">government back into the country regain</text>
  <text start="750.709" dur="6.401">power doesn&amp;#39;t matter how many people we</text>
  <text start="754.319" dur="5.491">have to kill it makes no difference if</text>
  <text start="757.11" dur="4.8">we have to kill hundreds of thousands of</text>
  <text start="759.81" dur="4.35">them as long as they learn their lesson</text>
  <text start="761.91" dur="6.659">never to question the government we put</text>
  <text start="764.16" dur="7.919">into place so be it we know already that</text>
  <text start="768.569" dur="6.02">the USS Mason well it fired three</text>
  <text start="772.079" dur="4.98">missiles at three different radar sites</text>
  <text start="774.589" dur="5.891">which belong to the hootie forces and</text>
  <text start="777.059" dur="5.82">they fired Tomahawk cruise missiles and</text>
  <text start="780.48" dur="4.76">we know right now that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="782.879" dur="5.341">government central bankers are going to</text>
  <text start="785.24" dur="8.469">escalate this because they can see right</text>
  <text start="788.22" dur="7.979">now that the paid mercenaries from Saudi</text>
  <text start="793.709" dur="6.36">Arabia they can&amp;#39;t get the job done plus</text>
  <text start="796.199" dur="6.36">now Congress push the Jasta law through</text>
  <text start="800.069" dur="4.981">saudi arabia&amp;#39;s looking at China looking</text>
  <text start="802.559" dur="4.59">at Russia and they might just say you</text>
  <text start="805.05" dur="6.089">know something you&amp;#39;re on your own here</text>
  <text start="807.149" dur="6.601">and we can see at this point that the</text>
  <text start="811.139" dur="4.17">United States government they might say</text>
  <text start="813.75" dur="2.97">hey Liss and this is well a one-time</text>
  <text start="815.309" dur="3.241">thing where we fired the missiles</text>
  <text start="816.72" dur="6.179">because what they&amp;#39;re doing is they pick</text>
  <text start="818.55" dur="7.769">these targets they destroy them and they</text>

  <text start="988.649" dur="6.081">United States well they&amp;#39;re preparing for</text>
  <text start="991.649" dur="6.12">a massive aerial campaign in my soul</text>
  <text start="994.73" dur="6.039">they&amp;#39;ve conducted ten airstrikes over</text>
  <text start="997.769" dur="5.85">muscle last night and we see that the</text>
  <text start="1000.769" dur="5.16">Iraqi forces they have about 65 thousand</text>
  <text start="1003.619" dur="5.431">Iraqi soldiers and six divisions and</text>
  <text start="1005.929" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;re preparing to to battle and to</text>
  <text start="1009.05" dur="6.779">retake the city of muscle there&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="1012.139" dur="6.48">10,000 Kurdish fighters that are also</text>
  <text start="1015.829" dur="4.7">expected to join the battle and six</text>
  <text start="1018.619" dur="5.79">thousand US troops are there to advise</text>
  <text start="1020.529" dur="6.43">everyone and we know that the US has</text>
  <text start="1024.409" dur="5.37">more than 6,000 troops there you have to</text>
  <text start="1026.959" dur="4.95">remember how the whole thing works the</text>
  <text start="1029.779" dur="4.26">Iraqi government and the US government</text>
  <text start="1031.909" dur="5.101">came to an agreement that they would</text>
  <text start="1034.039" dur="5.01">only keep 4500 permanent troops inside</text>
  <text start="1037.01" dur="5.1">of Iraq the rest of the troops that are</text>
  <text start="1039.049" dur="7.14">there they&amp;#39;re called temporary without</text>
  <text start="1042.11" dur="5.549">an expiration date so in reality the</text>
  <text start="1046.189" dur="4.47">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="1047.659" dur="6.39">they have an upward soldier count of</text>
  <text start="1050.659" dur="8.781">about 10,000 plus soldiers inside of</text>
  <text start="1054.049" dur="8.281">Iraq right now we see that in Aleppo the</text>
  <text start="1059.44" dur="7.739">terrorists the moderate rebels al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="1062.33" dur="8.719">al-nusrah al sham well they shelled a</text>
  <text start="1067.179" dur="8.86">bus station in Aleppo and five children</text>
  <text start="1071.049" dur="8.321">were killed we see right now that Russia</text>
  <text start="1076.039" dur="6.87">is agreeing to let the terrorists out of</text>
  <text start="1079.37" dur="6.179">Aleppo they want the civilians evacuated</text>
  <text start="1082.909" dur="5.341">from this entire area they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1085.549" dur="5.521">give everyone safe passage now of course</text>
  <text start="1088.25" dur="5.97">if the terrorists leave the area the</text>
  <text start="1091.07" dur="4.56">United States well they lose Aleppo</text>
  <text start="1094.22" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re not going to let this happen</text>
  <text start="1095.63" dur="3.84">this is why the terrorists are</text>
  <text start="1097.34" dur="5.3">continually using the civilians as</text>
  <text start="1099.47" dur="6.209">shields this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1102.64" dur="5.55">intermingling with the civilians so it</text>
  <text start="1105.679" dur="6.451">makes it very difficult to bomb the area</text>
  <text start="1108.19" dur="5.86">well it looks like Lavrov a</text>
  <text start="1112.13" dur="4.5">is going to get together with John Kerry</text>
  <text start="1114.05" dur="6.75">once again they&amp;#39;re going to try to iron</text>
  <text start="1116.63" dur="8.46">out a peace deal to see if they can stop</text>
  <text start="1120.8" dur="6">what is about to happen and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1125.09" dur="4.98">trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying to avoid</text>
  <text start="1126.8" dur="5.4">war because they realize eventually</text>
  <text start="1130.07" dur="4.47">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is the United</text>
  <text start="1132.2" dur="4.47">States is going to do something it might</text>
  <text start="1134.54" dur="3.78">not look like they actually did it</text>
  <text start="1136.67" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;ll turn it around and make it look</text>
  <text start="1138.32" dur="3.09">like it&amp;#39;s the other side and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1139.91" dur="3.36">have to retaliate just like in Yemen</text>
  <text start="1141.41" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re just you know out there with</text>
  <text start="1143.27" dur="4.53">their two destroyers off the coast of</text>
  <text start="1145.97" dur="3.93">Yemen and all of a sudden the Hootie&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1147.8" dur="4.89">decided to fire two missiles but it just</text>
  <text start="1149.9" dur="5.4">missed the ships because the aegis</text>
  <text start="1152.69" dur="5.37">system was able to jam them and protect</text>
  <text start="1155.3" dur="4.86">them and they missed completely well</text>
  <text start="1158.06" dur="4.35">that was a false flag the Hootie&amp;#39;s would</text>
  <text start="1160.16" dur="5.33">never fire missiles at the US and invite</text>
  <text start="1162.41" dur="7.08">them in to attack that&amp;#39;s ridiculous</text>
  <text start="1165.49" dur="7.03">these most likely were fired by the paid</text>
  <text start="1169.49" dur="5.19">mercenaries they told them to fire in a</text>
  <text start="1172.52" dur="4.95">certain location make sure you missed</text>
  <text start="1174.68" dur="5.94">the ships and this will allow the United</text>
  <text start="1177.47" dur="6.39">States to bomb in Yemen the same things</text>
  <text start="1180.62" dur="7.62">going to happen in Syria because come</text>
  <text start="1183.86" dur="7.92">Friday tomorrow we see Obama is going to</text>
  <text start="1188.24" dur="9.3">make a decision on what to do in Syria</text>
  <text start="1191.78" dur="9.78">and in one case he can just say okay</text>
  <text start="1197.54" dur="6.48">let&amp;#39;s leave Syria we&amp;#39;re done here just</text>
  <text start="1201.56" dur="6.78">let the petrodollar collapse we are done</text>
  <text start="1204.02" dur="7.86">I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s going to happen the</text>
  <text start="1208.34" dur="7.38">other alternative is to have the US</text>
  <text start="1211.88" dur="6.24">military use air strikes on the Syrian</text>
  <text start="1215.72" dur="6">military hit their munitions depots</text>
  <text start="1218.12" dur="6.9">radar anti-aircraft basis this is going</text>
  <text start="1221.72" dur="6.54">to be a problem Russia has jamming</text>
  <text start="1225.02" dur="5.55">technology they have the s-300s 400</text>
  <text start="1228.26" dur="5.07">missile systems in there and we know if</text>
  <text start="1230.57" dur="3.93">the u.s. attempts to fly and it looks</text>
  <text start="1233.33" dur="5.78">like they&amp;#39;re going to make making a</text>
  <text start="1234.5" dur="9.3">bombing run and hit these areas we know</text>
  <text start="1239.11" dur="6.88">Syria most likely is going to fire one</text>
  <text start="1243.8" dur="4.62">of these s-300 missiles</text>
  <text start="1245.99" dur="6.99">system missiles and it&amp;#39;s going to hit a</text>
  <text start="1248.42" dur="8.3">u.s. plane and at that point we are</text>
  <text start="1252.98" dur="6.96">going to have War General Joseph Dunford</text>
  <text start="1256.72" dur="6.3">warned that yes this would boast likely</text>
  <text start="1259.94" dur="8.61">lead to war if we go down this path</text>
  <text start="1263.02" dur="8.11">another alternative is to provide the</text>
  <text start="1268.55" dur="5.19">terrorist groups or i should say they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1271.13" dur="6.87">calling them the vetted rebels with more</text>
  <text start="1273.74" dur="6.45">sophisticated weapons which will most</text>
  <text start="1278" dur="4.38">likely lead to war anyhow but the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1280.19" dur="4.02">can say listen we didn&amp;#39;t shoot down the</text>
  <text start="1282.38" dur="5.01">Russian plane we didn&amp;#39;t shoot down the</text>
  <text start="1284.21" dur="5.46">Syrian plane it was the moderate rebels</text>
  <text start="1287.39" dur="5.039">that did that so you can&amp;#39;t have war with</text>
  <text start="1289.67" dur="5.22">the United States but Russia&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1292.429" dur="4.231">see this as very different Syria is</text>
  <text start="1294.89" dur="6.6">going to see this as very different and</text>
  <text start="1296.66" dur="8.519">at that point Russia and Syria will fire</text>
  <text start="1301.49" dur="6.569">upon the moderate rebels and this will</text>
  <text start="1305.179" dur="4.38">lead to war and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="1308.059" dur="4.021">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="1309.559" dur="7.111">they&amp;#39;re sending Russia a message because</text>
  <text start="1312.08" dur="7.79">in Damascus the Russian embassy was</text>
  <text start="1316.67" dur="5.79">shelled for two hours on Wednesday</text>
  <text start="1319.87" dur="5.65">damaged the building the compound the</text>
  <text start="1322.46" dur="8.07">adjacent buildings but the staff they</text>
  <text start="1325.52" dur="8.64">were not hurt and now we hear the Royal</text>
  <text start="1330.53" dur="7.68">Air Force they have ordered their pilots</text>
  <text start="1334.16" dur="6.69">to shoot down hostile Russian Jets over</text>
  <text start="1338.21" dur="5.91">Syria and this is where it gets a little</text>
  <text start="1340.85" dur="6.18">sticky here we understand if pilots are</text>
  <text start="1344.12" dur="8.04">fired upon they can fire back that makes</text>
  <text start="1347.03" dur="8.58">sense will Russia fire upon the jets</text>
  <text start="1352.16" dur="4.76">from the UK most likely not what would</text>
  <text start="1355.61" dur="4.44">be the reason what would be the motive</text>
  <text start="1356.92" dur="8.38">they know where it would lead to they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1360.05" dur="10.65">not going to do this but the other</text>
  <text start="1365.3" dur="8.879">statement from the UK they said if you</text>
  <text start="1370.7" dur="8.31">believe that the Russian jet is going to</text>
  <text start="1374.179" dur="9.881">be firing on you you need to fire back</text>
  <text start="1379.01" dur="8.35">well this is a very situation very</text>
  <text start="1384.06" dur="6.21">serious situation here because what is</text>
  <text start="1387.36" dur="5.01">the qualifiers for this oh look there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1390.27" dur="4.11">a Russian jet I&amp;#39;m flying pretty close to</text>
  <text start="1392.37" dur="4.44">it it looks like it&amp;#39;s going to get ready</text>
  <text start="1394.38" dur="5.76">to fire at me I better fire before they</text>
  <text start="1396.81" dur="6.06">even do anything boom we have World War</text>
  <text start="1400.14" dur="6.66">three so we&amp;#39;re at a point right now a</text>
