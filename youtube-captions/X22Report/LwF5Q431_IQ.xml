  <text start="55.53" dur="5.19">threat at this point an American&amp;#39;s rank</text>
  <text start="57.9" dur="5.64">international terrorism as the greatest</text>
  <text start="60.72" dur="4.98">threat to the US and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="63.54" dur="6.89">along with Iran&amp;#39;s development of nuclear</text>

  <text start="83.67" dur="4.019">States corporate media and government</text>
  <text start="85.439" dur="4.591">has been building up this propaganda and</text>
  <text start="87.689" dur="4.551">if you really look at this most of these</text>
  <text start="90.03" dur="5.28">countries are the countries without</text>
  <text start="92.24" dur="4.869">private western central banks it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="95.31" dur="4.979">the countries that they continually push</text>
  <text start="97.109" dur="5.01">and demonize because they do not control</text>
  <text start="100.289" dur="4.021">them and when they&amp;#39;re not controlled</text>
  <text start="102.119" dur="3.511">they&amp;#39;re considered the enemy and this is</text>
  <text start="104.31" dur="5.489">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="105.63" dur="6.57">interesting about this is that from just</text>
  <text start="109.799" dur="5.25">a year ago the critical threat</text>
  <text start="112.2" dur="5.82">percentage has come down back in</text>
  <text start="115.049" dur="5.091">February seventh of 2013 it was at</text>
  <text start="118.02" dur="4.019">eighty-one percent they believe that</text>
  <text start="120.14" dur="5.32">international terrorism was a critical</text>
  <text start="122.039" dur="5.82">fete and now in February of 2014 it is</text>
  <text start="125.46" dur="4.23">only at seventy-seven percent so they</text>
  <text start="127.859" dur="4.801">are losing the war and they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="129.69" dur="5.19">this propaganda spin that there is</text>
  <text start="132.66" dur="5.159">terrorism all around us and people are</text>
  <text start="134.88" dur="5.53">starting to hopefully wake up and see</text>
  <text start="137.819" dur="6.701">that this is all manufacturer</text>
  <text start="140.41" dur="6.57">to scare everyone and we can see that as</text>
  <text start="144.52" dur="3.96">the percentage comes down more and more</text>
  <text start="146.98" dur="2.82">people are starting to wake up more and</text>
  <text start="148.48" dur="3.51">more people are starting to look around</text>
  <text start="149.8" dur="7.23">and more and more people want to know</text>
  <text start="151.99" dur="8.12">what the actual truth is okay now we</text>
  <text start="157.03" dur="6">understand that the United States is</text>
  <text start="160.11" dur="6.55">having a tough time keeping the troops</text>
  <text start="163.03" dur="7.11">in Afghanistan President Karzai will not</text>
  <text start="166.66" dur="5.85">sign the bilateral security document</text>
  <text start="170.14" dur="4.35">which will allow the United States to</text>
  <text start="172.51" dur="4.83">stay in Afghanistan and raid the</text>
  <text start="174.49" dur="5.1">people&amp;#39;s homes at whim and he does not</text>
  <text start="177.34" dur="3.81">want this to happen so he&amp;#39;s not signing</text>
  <text start="179.59" dur="3.15">if he&amp;#39;s saying let&amp;#39;s wait for the next</text>
  <text start="181.15" dur="4.26">president to come into office because</text>
  <text start="182.74" dur="4.86">he&amp;#39;s leaving office and right now China</text>
  <text start="185.41" dur="3.6">is actually stepping up and saying you</text>
  <text start="187.6" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t need the United States at this</text>
  <text start="189.01" dur="4.77">point and you have to remember China is</text>
  <text start="191.26" dur="4.11">also in Afghanistan they&amp;#39;re helping them</text>
  <text start="193.78" dur="4.11">build their infrastructure they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="195.37" dur="4.95">helping them mine copper because they</text>
  <text start="197.89" dur="4.68">have a very big copper deposit there and</text>
  <text start="200.32" dur="4.85">China said on Saturday that it will work</text>
  <text start="202.57" dur="4.41">with Afghanistan to fight terrorism</text>
  <text start="205.17" dur="3.64">China will work with the international</text>
  <text start="206.98" dur="3.69">community for political reconciliation</text>
  <text start="208.81" dur="4.29">in Afghanistan and support</text>
  <text start="210.67" dur="4.55">reconstruction we will also work with</text>
  <text start="213.1" dur="6.18">Afghanistan and other neighbors to</text>
  <text start="215.22" dur="5.83">resolutely fight all terrorist forces so</text>
  <text start="219.28" dur="3.6">we can see what&amp;#39;s happening here the</text>
  <text start="221.05" dur="3.51">United States is losing its grip on</text>
  <text start="222.88" dur="4.26">Afghanistan of course in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="224.56" dur="4.02">they need to keep Afghanistan and keep</text>
  <text start="227.14" dur="3.69">troops in there and keep the bases</text>
  <text start="228.58" dur="4.83">operating because they do grow poppies</text>
  <text start="230.83" dur="5.82">in Afghanistan the US troops do guard</text>
  <text start="233.41" dur="5.31">them that poppy those poppy fields are</text>
  <text start="236.65" dur="3.51">then used to create opium and those are</text>
  <text start="238.72" dur="4.17">sailed all over the world to pay for</text>
  <text start="240.16" dur="5.16">covert operations around the world and</text>
  <text start="242.89" dur="5.58">again the terrorism that they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="245.32" dur="6.44">about is mostly manufactured and you can</text>
  <text start="248.47" dur="5.43">see that the President and Afghan</text>
  <text start="251.76" dur="3.67">Afghanistan do not want the United</text>
  <text start="253.9" dur="3.03">States in there anymore this is why</text>
  <text start="255.43" dur="3.48">nothing has been signed this is why</text>
  <text start="256.93" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re having a tough time and I</text>
  <text start="258.91" dur="7.11">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if you see more</text>
  <text start="262.45" dur="5.49">flare ups of terrorist attacks in there</text>
  <text start="266.02" dur="4.86">because again they&amp;#39;re not just going to</text>
  <text start="267.94" dur="6.44">leave Afghanistan alone if China is</text>
  <text start="270.88" dur="5.99">involved it&amp;#39;s not going to happen</text>
  <text start="274.38" dur="5.25">now we understand out in the Ukraine</text>
  <text start="276.87" dur="5.43">Crimea is going to have a referendum to</text>
  <text start="279.63" dur="4.95">join Russia and they&amp;#39;re moving this and</text>
  <text start="282.3" dur="5.52">pushing this forward and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="284.58" dur="5.67">actually doing is is creating many many</text>
  <text start="287.82" dur="4.74">offices and creating their own</text>
  <text start="290.25" dur="6.48">government at this time and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="292.56" dur="6.57">saying is the situation in in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="296.73" dur="5.52">right now they&amp;#39;re saying that they do</text>
  <text start="299.13" dur="6.63">not have to be a part of Ukraine because</text>
  <text start="302.25" dur="6.9">the coup d&amp;#39;etat was completely set up by</text>
  <text start="305.76" dur="5.49">the United States and the EU and again</text>
  <text start="309.15" dur="5.28">this whole thing was completely illegal</text>
  <text start="311.25" dur="6.45">we had a signed agreement between</text>
  <text start="314.43" dur="5.34">Ukraine Ukrainian government and the</text>
  <text start="317.7" dur="4.8">opposition they didn&amp;#39;t hold to this</text>
  <text start="319.77" dur="6.18">agreement and now we can do whatever we</text>
  <text start="322.5" dur="4.98">want and they&amp;#39;re saying that Crimea will</text>
  <text start="325.95" dur="4.05">now legally through democratic</text>
  <text start="327.48" dur="5.4">referendum join Russia and it certainly</text>
  <text start="330" dur="4.08">complies with international law because</text>
  <text start="332.88" dur="3.12">you know what the President of the</text>
  <text start="334.08" dur="4.11">United States was out there saying that</text>
  <text start="336" dur="5.64">this does not apply to international law</text>
  <text start="338.19" dur="6.54">you cannot just split off and part of</text>
  <text start="341.64" dur="5.88">the country go to to be on their own and</text>
  <text start="344.73" dur="4.38">the other part of Ukraine be on their</text>
  <text start="347.52" dur="3.84">own but we&amp;#39;ve seen this in many</text>
  <text start="349.11" dur="3.87">instances around the world remember</text>
  <text start="351.36" dur="3.57">Korea there&amp;#39;s a North and South Korea</text>
  <text start="352.98" dur="4.14">remember Vietnam there&amp;#39;s a North and</text>
  <text start="354.93" dur="4.14">South Vietnam remember Germany after the</text>
  <text start="357.12" dur="4.5">war there was an East and West Germany</text>
  <text start="359.07" dur="6.69">so you see this happen quite a bit and</text>
  <text start="361.62" dur="8.7">again if the people of Crimea do not</text>
  <text start="365.76" dur="7.47">want to be part of Ukraine the western</text>
  <text start="370.32" dur="5.88">portion of Ukraine they have the every</text>
  <text start="373.23" dur="4.86">right to say we do not want this and</text>
  <text start="376.2" dur="5.04">this is what they are doing at this time</text>
  <text start="378.09" dur="6.12">and right now Crimea is forming its own</text>
  <text start="381.24" dur="4.53">Armed Forces they just had a sarin air</text>
  <text start="384.21" dur="3.89">ceremony that marked the official</text>
  <text start="385.77" dur="5.34">formation of Crimea zone Armed Forces</text>
  <text start="388.1" dur="5.74">Crimea has has had its own Armed Forces</text>
  <text start="391.11" dur="4.68">for some time already and they hope</text>
  <text start="393.84" dur="4.05">these forces will ensure peace in Crimea</text>
  <text start="395.79" dur="6.03">especially during the coming referendum</text>
  <text start="397.89" dur="6.18">concerning Crimea&amp;#39;s future status now</text>
  <text start="401.82" dur="4.46">the president and the president of</text>
  <text start="404.07" dur="4.31">France are out there saying that</text>
  <text start="406.28" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;re go they&amp;#39;re giving another warning</text>
  <text start="408.38" dur="4.83">and they have warned of new measures</text>
  <text start="410.93" dur="5.01">against Russia if it fails to make</text>
  <text start="413.21" dur="5.85">progress on defusing the crisis in</text>
  <text start="415.94" dur="6.66">Ukraine and what they&amp;#39;re saying is we do</text>
  <text start="419.06" dur="5.55">not want Ukraine to split apart we need</text>
  <text start="422.6" dur="5.25">it all together we need the entire</text>
  <text start="424.61" dur="6.18">country on the EU system we spent a lot</text>
  <text start="427.85" dur="6">of money five billion dollars to set up</text>
  <text start="430.79" dur="5.04">this entire coup and right now if we do</text>
  <text start="433.85" dur="3.81">not get the entire Ukraine it is not</text>
  <text start="435.83" dur="4.95">worth our while because most of the</text>
  <text start="437.66" dur="6.3">product production most of the wealth is</text>
  <text start="440.78" dur="5.01">in the south and east they are the south</text>
  <text start="443.96" dur="4.68">and east do border along the Black Sea</text>
  <text start="445.79" dur="5.99">and they want the entire Ukraine and you</text>
  <text start="448.64" dur="8.37">have to remember before all this started</text>
  <text start="451.78" dur="9.13">Russia and Ukraine we&amp;#39;re joining</text>
  <text start="457.01" dur="7.469">together and Russia supplies all the oil</text>
  <text start="460.91" dur="6.15">and gas to the Ukraine and Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="464.479" dur="4.921">government decided and looked at the EU</text>
  <text start="467.06" dur="5.7">and it looked at Russia&amp;#39;s economic</text>
  <text start="469.4" dur="7.17">policies and they said you know what the</text>
  <text start="472.76" dur="6.18">EU is in trouble they have no money</text>
  <text start="476.57" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re all they&amp;#39;re doing is printing</text>
  <text start="478.94" dur="4.86">most of the countries are in debt most</text>
  <text start="482.21" dur="4.17">of the countries have twenty thirty</text>
  <text start="483.8" dur="5.19">forty percent of unemployment the youth</text>
  <text start="486.38" dur="4.95">unemployment is skyrocketing most of the</text>
  <text start="488.99" dur="4.799">countries are in austerity why in the</text>
  <text start="491.33" dur="6.959">world would we want to join the EU</text>
  <text start="493.789" dur="8.911">system and again Russia at this point</text>
  <text start="498.289" dur="9.541">already had already supplied the natural</text>
  <text start="502.7" dur="8.54">gas the oil to Ukraine Ukraine already</text>
  <text start="507.83" dur="7.889">was siding with Russia the only</text>
  <text start="511.24" dur="7.33">countries that wanted this to change was</text>
  <text start="515.719" dur="5.911">the EU countries and the United States</text>
  <text start="518.57" dur="6.9">and we have seen this happen all over</text>
  <text start="521.63" dur="6.33">the globe over and over again where they</text>
  <text start="525.47" dur="5.16">needed to go in and remove the</text>
  <text start="527.96" dur="6.21">government and it fits the same exact</text>
  <text start="530.63" dur="6.69">pattern and it&amp;#39;s not changing and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="534.17" dur="5.65">seen this in Yemen we&amp;#39;ve seen this in</text>
  <text start="537.32" dur="5.44">Egypt we&amp;#39;ve seen this in</text>
  <text start="539.82" dur="5.25">BIA Lebanon Iraq we&amp;#39;re seeing it in</text>
  <text start="542.76" dur="4.65">Africa we&amp;#39;re seeing in Thailand in</text>
  <text start="545.07" dur="3.66">Tunisia we are seeing it in all these</text>
  <text start="547.41" dur="3.75">countries and what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="548.73" dur="5.24">is that many of these countries that</text>
  <text start="551.16" dur="6.81">people are fighting back and in Libya</text>
  <text start="553.97" dur="5.44">the people have band together they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="557.97" dur="4.71">been fighting the government in Libya</text>
  <text start="559.41" dur="6.93">and they are winning right now the armed</text>
  <text start="562.68" dur="6.33">people of Libya they control ports in</text>
  <text start="566.34" dur="5.84">eastern Libya and on Saturday they</text>
  <text start="569.01" dur="5.4">started independently exporting oil</text>
  <text start="572.18" dur="4.84">bypassing the central government in</text>
  <text start="574.41" dur="4.5">major escalation of their blockade to</text>
  <text start="577.02" dur="4.62">demand a share of the nation&amp;#39;s petroleum</text>
  <text start="578.91" dur="6.63">wealth the rebels which are the people</text>
  <text start="581.64" dur="9.15">of Libya have seized three major ports</text>
  <text start="585.54" dur="8.22">since august and again if they go ahead</text>
  <text start="590.79" dur="6.39">and they start selling this oil not</text>
  <text start="593.76" dur="6">using the US dollar this is a huge</text>
  <text start="597.18" dur="5.61">problem for the central bankers and this</text>
  <text start="599.76" dur="6.6">is why the US government decided to send</text>
  <text start="602.79" dur="7.38">down officers and help train 85 thousand</text>
  <text start="606.36" dur="6.54">to 8,000 soldiers in Libya to fight the</text>
  <text start="610.17" dur="5.16">militias of Libya and these are the</text>
  <text start="612.9" dur="5.01">people of Libya and right now they are</text>
  <text start="615.33" dur="6.39">completely losing the battle and again</text>
  <text start="617.91" dur="7.1">here we are where they are bypassing the</text>
  <text start="621.72" dur="6.36">US dollar and Tripoli has responded the</text>
  <text start="625.01" dur="5.59">the shadow of a government of a puppet</text>
  <text start="628.08" dur="6.09">government responded and said it would</text>
  <text start="630.6" dur="7.89">destroy tankers trying to buy oil that</text>
  <text start="634.17" dur="6.75">is not being sold using the US dollar so</text>
  <text start="638.49" dur="5.39">here it is it begins we have a conflict</text>
  <text start="640.92" dur="7.26">in Ukraine we have a conflict in Libya</text>
  <text start="643.88" dur="7.3">right now and right now the Western</text>
  <text start="648.18" dur="6.36">powers worry Libya will slide into</text>
  <text start="651.18" dur="5.61">instability or even break apart as the</text>
  <text start="654.54" dur="4.41">government and they&amp;#39;re afraid that Libya</text>
  <text start="656.79" dur="5.37">might split into two different countries</text>
  <text start="658.95" dur="5.37">at this time now we see this happening</text>
  <text start="662.16" dur="5.07">in Ukraine we see it happening in Libya</text>
  <text start="664.32" dur="6.06">and it all revolves around the same</text>
  <text start="667.23" dur="6.799">thing propping up the US dollar keeping</text>
  <text start="670.38" dur="6.569">it alive keeping all countries</text>
  <text start="674.029" dur="6.49">with the US dollar so they could pay for</text>
  <text start="676.949" dur="5.161">the natural resources and again we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="680.519" dur="4.49">seeing this all over the place and there</text>
  <text start="682.11" dur="6">is there is a North Korea oil tanker</text>
  <text start="685.009" dur="5.8">which was trying to load crude and an</text>
  <text start="688.11" dur="5.729">Eastern port control by the arm people</text>
  <text start="690.809" dur="5.311">of Libya and the Tripoli is out there</text>
  <text start="693.839" dur="5.011">saying listen if you sell them this oil</text>
  <text start="696.12" dur="4.379">we will blow this tanker out of the</text>
  <text start="698.85" dur="3.87">water because we will not let this</text>
  <text start="700.499" dur="3.9">happen in these orders most likely are</text>

  <text start="704.399" dur="4.951">government saying do not let them do</text>
  <text start="706.829" dur="4.221">this because once this started this</text>
  <text start="709.35" dur="4.56">starts it will be like a domino effect</text>
  <text start="711.05" dur="4.389">across in the entire country of Libya</text>
  <text start="713.91" dur="3.33">and then it will spread to other</text>
  <text start="715.439" dur="4.801">countries and again I&amp;#39;ve mentioned this</text>
  <text start="717.24" dur="6.3">before if this happens these countries</text>
  <text start="720.24" dur="6.769">will not have to hold US dollars because</text>
  <text start="723.54" dur="9.359">they will not need them to purchase oil</text>
  <text start="727.009" dur="9.611">from Libya to purchase oil from Iraq to</text>
  <text start="732.899" dur="6.571">purchase oil from Lebanon to purchase</text>
  <text start="736.62" dur="5.43">oil from Yemen they will not need it and</text>
  <text start="739.47" dur="4.71">they will remove it from their reserves</text>
  <text start="742.05" dur="6">and send these dollars back to the</text>

  <text start="751.439" dur="6.39">tankers crew and they&amp;#39;re going to take</text>
  <text start="754.889" dur="5.43">them into custody if this goes forward</text>
  <text start="757.829" dur="5.641">and the people of Libya has started</text>
  <text start="760.319" dur="4.77">already exporting oil bypassing the</text>
  <text start="763.47" dur="3.51">government they&amp;#39;re not listening to what</text>
  <text start="765.089" dur="6.12">the government says and they are selling</text>
  <text start="766.98" dur="6.839">this oil to other places bypassing the</text>
  <text start="771.209" dur="7.74">US dollar and we&amp;#39;re going to see things</text>
  <text start="773.819" dur="7.74">really escalate in this area now we</text>
  <text start="778.949" dur="5.7">understand we have the incident</text>
  <text start="781.559" dur="5.52">happening in the Ukraine we see we have</text>
  <text start="784.649" dur="4.05">the incident happening in Libya we see</text>
  <text start="787.079" dur="4.38">what they&amp;#39;re having drone attacks in the</text>
  <text start="788.699" dur="5.07">Yemen and this is all happening all over</text>
  <text start="791.459" dur="5.94">the place there&amp;#39;s more troops being sent</text>
  <text start="793.769" dur="6.091">to Africa at this point in time Spain is</text>
  <text start="797.399" dur="4.951">wrapping is are ramping up there</text>
  <text start="799.86" dur="6.24">allowing more US soldiers in there to be</text>
  <text start="802.35" dur="5.05">deployed to Africa at this time because</text>
  <text start="806.1" dur="3.01">things are really going to</text>
  <text start="807.4" dur="3.57">art to escalate because people are</text>
  <text start="809.11" dur="3.9">fighting back they don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="810.97" dur="4.11">central government of United States in</text>
  <text start="813.01" dur="4.2">their country they do not want the</text>
  <text start="815.08" dur="4.62">central bankers in there and the people</text>
  <text start="817.21" dur="7.77">are rising up and fighting back at this</text>
  <text start="819.7" dur="7.14">time and in Ukraine what is happening we</text>
  <text start="824.98" dur="4.35">have Putin on one side and I mentioned</text>
  <text start="826.84" dur="4.26">this before we have the president of</text>
  <text start="829.33" dur="4.74">United States on the other other side</text>
  <text start="831.1" dur="5.37">Barack Obama and both of them most</text>
  <text start="834.07" dur="4.35">likely will not back down and I hear a</text>
  <text start="836.47" dur="4.74">lot of propaganda out there that Putin</text>
  <text start="838.42" dur="7.26">is ready to strike Putin&amp;#39;s moving in and</text>
  <text start="841.21" dur="6.72">again if Putin China all these countries</text>
  <text start="845.68" dur="4.17">actually wanted to destroy the United</text>
  <text start="847.93" dur="4.17">States it would be very simple they</text>
  <text start="849.85" dur="5.1">wouldn&amp;#39;t even have to fire a shot all</text>
  <text start="852.1" dur="5.91">they would have to do is dump their US</text>
  <text start="854.95" dur="5.28">dollars and dump all their Treasuries</text>
  <text start="858.01" dur="4.71">they would demolish and implode the</text>
  <text start="860.23" dur="4.95">United States with a flick of a button</text>
  <text start="862.72" dur="6.83">and they wouldn&amp;#39;t even have to fire a</text>
  <text start="865.18" dur="7.47">shot again we have to remember Putin</text>
  <text start="869.55" dur="6.82">de-escalated what was happening in Syria</text>
  <text start="872.65" dur="6.33">this at this time he could have gone to</text>
  <text start="876.37" dur="5.4">war with the US but if you have to</text>
  <text start="878.98" dur="5.16">remember he was talking about peace at</text>
  <text start="881.77" dur="5.07">this time while the United States was</text>
  <text start="884.14" dur="4.68">ramping up war bringing in ships getting</text>
  <text start="886.84" dur="3.54">ready to strike at any minute didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="888.82" dur="3.63">want to hear what Assad had to say</text>
  <text start="890.38" dur="5.01">didn&amp;#39;t want to work out any terms they</text>
  <text start="892.45" dur="5.76">cross the red line but Putin was out</text>
  <text start="895.39" dur="5.58">there and I&amp;#39;m not sticking up for Putin</text>
  <text start="898.21" dur="5.64">I&amp;#39;m not saying he&amp;#39;s a great guy but at</text>
  <text start="900.97" dur="6.18">that point in time strategically he was</text>
  <text start="903.85" dur="5.37">looking for peace he was not looking to</text>
  <text start="907.15" dur="4.53">go to war the same thing as happening in</text>
  <text start="909.22" dur="4.74">Ukraine they understand the central</text>
  <text start="911.68" dur="4.17">bankers created this coup and right now</text>
  <text start="913.96" dur="4.68">if he really wanted to he could have</text>
  <text start="915.85" dur="5.22">just ramped up and brought in destroy</text>
  <text start="918.64" dur="5.34">the opposition and taken over Ukraine</text>
  <text start="921.07" dur="6.21">with no problems whatsoever but what do</text>
  <text start="923.98" dur="6.15">we see right now we see a destroyer from</text>
  <text start="927.28" dur="7.2">the u.s. moving into the territory we</text>
  <text start="930.13" dur="6.33">see both sides ramping up with military</text>
  <text start="934.48" dur="4.23">assets because it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="936.46" dur="4.679">difficult for either side to back down</text>
  <text start="938.71" dur="4.919">because when one side backs down</text>
  <text start="941.139" dur="3.781">it&amp;#39;s not going to look good and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="943.629" dur="3.36">going to look good for that person and</text>
  <text start="944.92" dur="4.349">the strength of that person if they</text>
  <text start="946.989" dur="3.87">decide to bent down and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="949.269" dur="5.73">see we&amp;#39;re going to have to see how this</text>
  <text start="950.859" dur="7.89">plays out and where the actual spark is</text>
  <text start="954.999" dur="7.13">that triggers the actual war and again</text>
  <text start="958.749" dur="8.13">we have to remember the central bankers</text>
  <text start="962.129" dur="7.661">need Ukraine they need it they need this</text>
  <text start="966.879" dur="5.19">strategic location they need to get in</text>
  <text start="969.79" dur="4.829">there they need to put it on NATO they</text>
  <text start="972.069" dur="6.18">needed to put it on the EU system Russia</text>
  <text start="974.619" dur="6.69">at this point already has the production</text>
  <text start="978.249" dur="5.49">area already has the Crimea already has</text>
  <text start="981.309" dur="5.041">the south and the east side they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="983.739" dur="7.46">even care about the west side the US</text>
  <text start="986.35" dur="7.949">could have it and right now the u.s.</text>
  <text start="991.199" dur="7.06">their motive and the central bankers</text>
  <text start="994.299" dur="6.03">motive is to capture the entire country</text>
  <text start="998.259" dur="5.401">of Ukraine because they understand that</text>
  <text start="1000.329" dur="6.57">the dollar is collapsing and they want</text>
  <text start="1003.66" dur="6.389">war they want this they need it because</text>
  <text start="1006.899" dur="6.72">it will cover up the collapse listen if</text>
  <text start="1010.049" dur="6.33">Russia or China wanted to collapse the</text>
  <text start="1013.619" dur="4.95">dollar they could do it at any second it</text>
  <text start="1016.379" dur="4.92">wouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem but right now</text>
  <text start="1018.569" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;re not looking to do that they</text>
  <text start="1021.299" dur="4.701">could have done it without Ukraine they</text>
  <text start="1022.889" dur="6.54">could have done it at any time they are</text>
  <text start="1026" dur="6.61">strategically trying to remove the</text>
  <text start="1029.429" dur="5.191">dollar and put the you want in place but</text>
  <text start="1032.61" dur="4.289">again the central bankers will not let</text>
  <text start="1034.62" dur="4.769">this happen they&amp;#39;d rather go to war and</text>
  <text start="1036.899" dur="5.31">you have to remember war benefits the</text>
  <text start="1039.389" dur="6.091">central bankers because countries have</text>
  <text start="1042.209" dur="6.69">to borrow to pay for the war countries</text>
  <text start="1045.48" dur="5.76">have to borrow to rebuild after the war</text>
  <text start="1048.899" dur="5.551">and again these central bankers their</text>
  <text start="1051.24" dur="5.429">ego is way way up there they do believe</text>
  <text start="1054.45" dur="4.77">that they will be victorious they do</text>
  <text start="1056.669" dur="4.561">believe that if it does go nuclear they</text>
  <text start="1059.22" dur="4.589">have bunkers underground they will</text>
  <text start="1061.23" dur="6">emerge after the war take over the</text>
  <text start="1063.809" dur="6.531">entire system and they will reset the</text>
  <text start="1067.23" dur="6.03">entire system and this is their belief</text>
  <text start="1070.34" dur="4.07">now we understand that the central</text>
  <text start="1073.26" dur="3.16">bankers</text>
  <text start="1074.41" dur="4.41">want war we know something&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1076.42" dur="5.46">happen we know they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="1078.82" dur="5.13">try to shift the American people into</text>
  <text start="1081.88" dur="4.5">going walk-in toward right now the polls</text>
  <text start="1083.95" dur="4.68">are very low the american people believe</text>
  <text start="1086.38" dur="4.02">we shouldn&amp;#39;t even be in ukraine if we</text>
  <text start="1088.63" dur="3.9">should have nothing to do with ukraine</text>
  <text start="1090.4" dur="3.87">and just like the same thing that</text>
  <text start="1092.53" dur="3.78">happened in Syria so they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1094.27" dur="4.89">have to switch and change the minds of</text>
  <text start="1096.31" dur="6.27">the American people and Congress and</text>
  <text start="1099.16" dur="5.28">right now we understand that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1102.58" dur="4.62">been using the propaganda to build up</text>
  <text start="1104.44" dur="5.85">the next event and this event will allow</text>
  <text start="1107.2" dur="5.46">them to say see we told you we need to</text>
  <text start="1110.29" dur="5.85">go to war and right now a report came</text>
  <text start="1112.66" dur="5.79">out that about on the power grid the on</text>
  <text start="1116.14" dur="4.17">the energy sector last year there was</text>
  <text start="1118.45" dur="4.59">about a hundred and fifty three cyber</text>
  <text start="1120.31" dur="5.43">attacks that actually got into the</text>
  <text start="1123.04" dur="6.48">systems that could have caused havoc on</text>
  <text start="1125.74" dur="5.97">the power grid and what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1129.52" dur="5.07">is if one of these get through as</text>
  <text start="1131.71" dur="6.48">they&amp;#39;re seeing these attacks grow it</text>
  <text start="1134.59" dur="8.19">could knock out the entire power system</text>
  <text start="1138.19" dur="7.05">and again this is definitely a very big</text>
  <text start="1142.78" dur="5.85">concern of mine because I do believe in</text>
  <text start="1145.24" dur="5.67">2003 this was not a Down wire that</text>
  <text start="1148.63" dur="5.6">caused a ripple effect that shut down</text>
  <text start="1150.91" dur="6">the entire system this was a planned</text>
  <text start="1154.23" dur="5.89">attack none in the tack but I planned</text>
  <text start="1156.91" dur="5.82">exercise to see how hard it would be and</text>
  <text start="1160.12" dur="5.07">how easy it would be to bring down the</text>
  <text start="1162.73" dur="5.94">grid and all of a sudden we&amp;#39;ve seen a</text>
  <text start="1165.19" dur="5.93">dry run exercise out in California and</text>
  <text start="1168.67" dur="4.98">there have been many reports that</text>
  <text start="1171.12" dur="6.43">combining these two of a cyber attack</text>
  <text start="1173.65" dur="7.05">and a physical attack on the power grid</text>
  <text start="1177.55" dur="6.57">system that it could bring down areas</text>
  <text start="1180.7" dur="5.7">and put them into darkness listen</text>
  <text start="1184.12" dur="4.29">everyone thanks a lot for listening be</text>
  <text start="1186.4" dur="4.61">well be safe and especially be prepared</text>
