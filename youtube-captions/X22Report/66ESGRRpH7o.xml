  <text start="100.87" dur="5.82">with Trump this has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="103.15" dur="7.65">what is happening today this has to do</text>
  <text start="106.69" dur="9.06">with the central bankers and how their</text>
  <text start="110.8" dur="8.07">reserve currency does not last forever</text>
  <text start="115.75" dur="7.29">usually it collapses between 45 and 50</text>
  <text start="118.87" dur="6.87">years and they have figured out ways to</text>
  <text start="123.04" dur="7.169">make it a little bit longer through</text>
  <text start="125.74" dur="9.99">manipulation of course but in the end it</text>
  <text start="130.209" dur="8.961">always implodes on itself and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="135.73" dur="7.19">nothing that anyone can do to stop it</text>
  <text start="139.17" dur="6.64">think about the global debt load on</text>
  <text start="142.92" dur="6.16">every single country on every single</text>
  <text start="145.81" dur="6.69">person and all you have to do is say hey</text>
  <text start="149.08" dur="6.93">if I was running a household and maybe</text>
  <text start="152.5" dur="5.79">you are if I had all this debt with the</text>
  <text start="156.01" dur="4.47">same income coming in year after year</text>
  <text start="158.29" dur="6.029">but the debt continually climbs the</text>
  <text start="160.48" dur="4.04">interest rates are say one percent but</text>
  <text start="164.319" dur="3.471">the</text>
  <text start="164.52" dur="5.52">that continually increases you would not</text>
  <text start="167.79" dur="4.29">be able to sustain this eventually</text>
  <text start="170.04" dur="3.96">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is the amount of</text>
  <text start="172.08" dur="5.31">money that you&amp;#39;re making would not be</text>
  <text start="174" dur="7.29">able to cover any of the payments this</text>
  <text start="177.39" dur="5.79">is what&amp;#39;s happening around the world the</text>
  <text start="181.29" dur="6.18">central bank system their debt load</text>
  <text start="183.18" dur="7.29">becomes so massive that every single</text>
  <text start="187.47" dur="6.68">country every single person cannot</text>
  <text start="190.47" dur="6.78">handle it and countries around the world</text>
  <text start="194.15" dur="5.47">have been telling everyone they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="197.25" dur="4.29">getting ready for it and if you were</text>
  <text start="199.62" dur="5.58">listening you could hear it</text>
  <text start="201.54" dur="6.27">many people don&amp;#39;t hear it and we&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="205.2" dur="5.13">getting into that in just a minute but</text>
  <text start="207.81" dur="5.25">let&amp;#39;s start with what&amp;#39;s happening with</text>
  <text start="210.33" dur="4.32">the global economy we know that there is</text>
  <text start="213.06" dur="3.45">a major slowdown has nothing to do a</text>
  <text start="214.65" dur="4.31">trump has nothing to do with the tariffs</text>
  <text start="216.51" dur="6.18">it has to do with the central bank</text>
  <text start="218.96" dur="6.1">global economy that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s slowing</text>
  <text start="222.69" dur="6">down they knew that this was going to</text>
  <text start="225.06" dur="6.84">happen if we look out in Australia at or</text>
  <text start="228.69" dur="5.94">Canada or Europe you can see that the</text>
  <text start="231.9" dur="4.32">housing markets they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="234.63" dur="3.72">deteriorate even here in the United</text>
  <text start="236.22" dur="5.55">States so if you go out to Australia for</text>
  <text start="238.35" dur="4.68">instance they&amp;#39;re having a major problem</text>
  <text start="241.77" dur="3.3">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="243.03" dur="4.23">is that the Australian government</text>
  <text start="245.07" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;ve been telling first-time buyers</text>
  <text start="247.26" dur="7.89">five months before the bus began to get</text>
  <text start="251.04" dur="6.48">into this Sydney housing market guess</text>
  <text start="255.15" dur="4.89">what happened everything started to</text>
  <text start="257.52" dur="5.91">decline they were telling everyone if</text>
  <text start="260.04" dur="6.14">you do this you&amp;#39;ll be fine but if you</text>
  <text start="263.43" dur="5.28">look across the metro area of Sydney</text>
  <text start="266.18" dur="4.75">prices of all types of homes combined</text>
  <text start="268.71" dur="4.83">and this is according to court logics</text>
  <text start="270.93" dur="6.54">home value index fell one percent in</text>
  <text start="273.54" dur="6.93">February from January 10.4% from a year</text>
  <text start="277.47" dur="6.87">ago nearly 13 percent from its peak in</text>
  <text start="280.47" dur="8.03">July 2017 what are we watching here</text>
  <text start="284.34" dur="7.32">we&amp;#39;re watching the bubbles deflate and</text>
  <text start="288.5" dur="6.21">people who bought their homes on the</text>
  <text start="291.66" dur="6.45">high end they will soon be underwater</text>
  <text start="294.71" dur="6.04">all those people that just purchased</text>
  <text start="298.11" dur="3.899">they&amp;#39;re going to be in trouble if you</text>
  <text start="300.75" dur="4.31">look at Mel Bourne</text>
  <text start="302.009" dur="6.84">we&amp;#39;re seeing the same exact problems</text>
  <text start="305.06" dur="8.159">they&amp;#39;ve from November 2017 to October</text>
  <text start="308.849" dur="7.29">2018 it&amp;#39;s a five percent decline and</text>
  <text start="313.219" dur="5.861">many of these people they have huge</text>
  <text start="316.139" dur="5.46">mortgages but we also see this in Europe</text>
  <text start="319.08" dur="5.63">we also see this in Canada we also see</text>
  <text start="321.599" dur="6.03">this in the United States and right now</text>
  <text start="324.71" dur="6.22">the world&amp;#39;s interest rates are very very</text>
  <text start="327.629" dur="5.88">low humanity if they just tick up a</text>
  <text start="330.93" dur="4.769">little bit think about it the Fed was</text>
  <text start="333.509" dur="5.581">increasing rates here in the United</text>
  <text start="335.699" dur="4.861">States and it was throwing people</text>
  <text start="339.09" dur="4.079">completely out of them out of the</text>
  <text start="340.56" dur="5.46">housing market they could not afford a</text>
  <text start="343.169" dur="4.321">home and those people with variable</text>
  <text start="346.02" dur="4.23">rates well they were getting nervous and</text>
  <text start="347.49" dur="4.709">afraid because they saw their payments</text>
  <text start="350.25" dur="5.58">going up and they weren&amp;#39;t planning on</text>
  <text start="352.199" dur="6.631">this and it was hurting the housing</text>
  <text start="355.83" dur="5.699">market it still is hurting the housing</text>
  <text start="358.83" dur="5.22">market member the housing markets they</text>
  <text start="361.529" dur="5.01">were pumped up by the central bank&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="364.05" dur="5.7">would they like to pump up the housing</text>
  <text start="366.539" dur="5.791">markets because when people feel like</text>
  <text start="369.75" dur="3.87">they have equity in their home they feel</text>
  <text start="372.33" dur="4.739">very comfortable because if they bought</text>
  <text start="373.62" dur="5.699">a house at 300 or 200 or 400 and it went</text>
  <text start="377.069" dur="4.41">up a hundred thousand they feel really</text>
  <text start="379.319" dur="4.831">good about themselves they feel like oh</text>
  <text start="381.479" dur="4.831">don&amp;#39;t worry we have this money it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="384.15" dur="3.989">our home this is fantastic if something</text>
  <text start="386.31" dur="3.9">happens we can always fall back on this</text>
  <text start="388.139" dur="5.601">we can always take an equity line of</text>
  <text start="390.21" dur="6.56">credit on our home many people have and</text>
  <text start="393.74" dur="7.359">now home prices are starting to decline</text>
  <text start="396.77" dur="6.639">this is a major problem and we know that</text>
  <text start="401.099" dur="4.891">the everyday person on the street they</text>
  <text start="403.409" dur="6">have one two three part-time jobs the</text>
  <text start="405.99" dur="6.389">the quality of jobs is just not out</text>
  <text start="409.409" dur="5.491">there yet I know Trump he is bringing a</text>
  <text start="412.379" dur="4.5">lot of the manufacturing jobs back he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="414.9" dur="3.6">trying to bring businesses back because</text>
  <text start="416.879" dur="4.41">what has happened with the central banks</text>
  <text start="418.5" dur="6.02">they moved all the quality jobs out of</text>
  <text start="421.289" dur="5.791">the United States someplace else and</text>
  <text start="424.52" dur="4.629">there&amp;#39;s a lot of part-time work here</text>
  <text start="427.08" dur="3.36">because we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;ve turned into a</text>
  <text start="429.149" dur="3.041">service country</text>
  <text start="430.44" dur="3.39">Trump is trying to bring back the</text>
  <text start="432.19" dur="5.25">you&amp;#39;re factoring to make us a</text>
  <text start="433.83" dur="5.11">manufacturing powerhouse once again but</text>
  <text start="437.44" dur="2.24">we know that that a central bank the</text>
  <text start="438.94" dur="3.96">deep state</text>
  <text start="439.68" dur="4.57">they had different plans they were going</text>
  <text start="442.9" dur="2.79">to turn the u.s. into a third world</text>
  <text start="444.25" dur="3.53">country so everything has to be reversed</text>
  <text start="445.69" dur="4.79">and that&amp;#39;s what Trump is doing right now</text>
  <text start="447.78" dur="5.34">but what we see happening is that people</text>
  <text start="450.48" dur="6.04">since they don&amp;#39;t have high-paying jobs</text>
  <text start="453.12" dur="5.05">yes they might have a job but most of</text>
  <text start="456.52" dur="3.09">the time it&amp;#39;s part time or two part time</text>
  <text start="458.17" dur="1.92">remember they count that as a full-time</text>
  <text start="459.61" dur="3.33">job</text>
  <text start="460.09" dur="4.05">Trump is using the manipulation that the</text>
  <text start="462.94" dur="4.32">central bank the deep state have been</text>
  <text start="464.14" dur="5.31">using in the past to his advantage so</text>
  <text start="467.26" dur="4.47">what are we seeing with people&amp;#39;s income</text>
  <text start="469.45" dur="5.58">and their savings and their spending</text>
  <text start="471.73" dur="5.4">well December personal incomes fell by</text>
  <text start="475.03" dur="4.98">0.1 percent month on month they were</text>
  <text start="477.13" dur="5.24">expected to rise by 0.3 percent this is</text>
  <text start="480.01" dur="6.3">the worst drop since January of 2013</text>
  <text start="482.37" dur="6.12">personal spending pledged 0.5% month a</text>
  <text start="486.31" dur="5.49">month in January the worst drop since</text>
  <text start="488.49" dur="6.58">September of 2009 now what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="491.8" dur="5.76">bizarre is that the be ei published data</text>
  <text start="495.07" dur="4.31">and the data revealed income data for</text>
  <text start="497.56" dur="5.4">January but all the spending data for</text>
  <text start="499.38" dur="7.3">January was missing only December data</text>
  <text start="502.96" dur="6.93">was included so that&amp;#39;s kind of odd right</text>
  <text start="506.68" dur="6.57">there but the mainstream media they are</text>
  <text start="509.89" dur="6.3">out there and they are looking at</text>
  <text start="513.25" dur="5.61">Trump&amp;#39;s tax cuts and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="516.19" dur="7.05">using the narrative that people are not</text>
  <text start="518.86" dur="6.3">getting a good return it&amp;#39;s a lot less</text>
  <text start="523.24" dur="4.17">than what they thought they were going</text>
  <text start="525.16" dur="4.73">to get and they&amp;#39;re blaming it on Trump</text>
  <text start="527.41" dur="4.38">Adam Schiff tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="529.89" dur="3.49">who could have predicted the</text>
  <text start="531.79" dur="2.97">middle-class Americans were being for a</text>
  <text start="533.38" dur="4.5">big disappointment when their tax</text>
  <text start="534.76" dur="5.34">refunds came this year who could have</text>
  <text start="537.88" dur="3.81">thought that the GOP tax cut would only</text>
  <text start="540.1" dur="4.29">benefit the wealthy and not working</text>
  <text start="541.69" dur="5.37">families everyone we all saw it coming</text>
  <text start="544.39" dur="4.74">well you really didn&amp;#39;t see anything</text>
  <text start="547.06" dur="5.67">coming because if you really look at the</text>
  <text start="549.13" dur="6.42">tax code and the tax policy you would</text>
  <text start="552.73" dur="4.37">see first of all that average refunds</text>
  <text start="555.55" dur="4.65">are up 1.3 percent</text>
  <text start="557.1" dur="5.98">secondly there&amp;#39;s less being taken out of</text>
  <text start="560.2" dur="4.88">your check so the IRS released data on</text>
  <text start="563.08" dur="4.82">Thursday showing that the average</text>
  <text start="565.08" dur="6.15">refund so far this year is slightly</text>
  <text start="567.9" dur="6.78">larger than it was last year the average</text>
  <text start="571.23" dur="6.6">refund was 3143 through February 22nd</text>
  <text start="574.68" dur="6.84">that&amp;#39;s 1.3 percent greater than the</text>
  <text start="577.83" dur="10.5">average refund of 3103 through February</text>
  <text start="581.52" dur="10.59">23rd 2018 plus there was less money or</text>
  <text start="588.33" dur="7.62">currency taken out of your check so you</text>
  <text start="592.11" dur="7.47">had that currency to keep and to use for</text>
  <text start="595.95" dur="7.14">bills or anything like that Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="599.58" dur="5.49">jr. summed it all up in a tweet even</text>
  <text start="603.09" dur="3.45">Bloomberg a financial news station</text>
  <text start="605.07" dur="4.2">pushing the leftist misinformation</text>
  <text start="606.54" dur="4.62">campaign that lowered tax refunds means</text>
  <text start="609.27" dur="4.92">anything shame on you</text>
  <text start="611.16" dur="5.4">reality 90% of US households are</text>
  <text start="614.19" dur="4.41">benefiting from tax reform if your</text>
  <text start="616.56" dur="5.94">refund is lower it&amp;#39;s because you paid</text>
  <text start="618.6" dur="6">less and the code was simplified that</text>
  <text start="622.5" dur="4.26">meant the government think keep your</text>
  <text start="624.6" dur="4.92">money interest-free you actually</text>
  <text start="626.76" dur="4.41">received your money and you can spend it</text>
  <text start="629.52" dur="4.32">any way you want it you can put in your</text>
  <text start="631.17" dur="4.38">savings you can pay your bills or you</text>
  <text start="633.84" dur="7.14">can go out shopping it didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="635.55" dur="9.36">matter but you were able to keep it we</text>
  <text start="640.98" dur="6.84">see that the Fed they are not budging on</text>
  <text start="644.91" dur="6.38">the interest rates right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="647.82" dur="6.33">still in that patient approach and</text>
  <text start="651.29" dur="5.38">they&amp;#39;re not looking to raise the</text>
  <text start="654.15" dur="6.93">interest rates as of yet but they will</text>
  <text start="656.67" dur="8.46">be meeting in Washington on March 19th</text>
  <text start="661.08" dur="6.6">and 20th this I do believe will be the</text>
  <text start="665.13" dur="4.5">test remember Q has told us that they</text>
  <text start="667.68" dur="5.01">were supposed to raise interest rates in</text>
  <text start="669.63" dur="4.95">March and then raise them very very</text>
  <text start="672.69" dur="4.95">quickly throughout the rest of the year</text>
  <text start="674.58" dur="5.82">to cause a chain reaction to bring down</text>
  <text start="677.64" dur="5.79">the economy right before the 2020</text>
  <text start="680.4" dur="4.62">election so we will see what the Fed</text>
  <text start="683.43" dur="4.89">does at this point because that they</text>
  <text start="685.02" dur="5.85">continue with their patient model that</text>
  <text start="688.32" dur="6.48">tells us that Trump has complete and</text>
  <text start="690.87" dur="6.84">utter control and they stopped the</text>
  <text start="694.8" dur="4.26">recession in 2020</text>
  <text start="697.71" dur="4.68">now in the beginning of this report we</text>
  <text start="699.06" dur="6.66">talked about how countries were</text>
  <text start="702.39" dur="6">telegraphing an economic message to all</text>
  <text start="705.72" dur="5.88">those people who wanted to listen to it</text>
  <text start="708.39" dur="4.23">and we&amp;#39;ve been talking about this for a</text>
  <text start="711.6" dur="4.23">very long time</text>
  <text start="712.62" dur="5.55">we know the the Federal Reserve the</text>
  <text start="715.83" dur="4.56">reserve currency of the world right now</text>
  <text start="718.17" dur="5.13">will not last forever</text>
  <text start="720.39" dur="5.4">we know that the central banks they were</text>
  <text start="723.3" dur="5.13">planning to move their system out of the</text>
  <text start="725.79" dur="5.31">United States most likely into China or</text>
  <text start="728.43" dur="5.43">maybe the IMF at this point it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="731.1" dur="5.43">really matter because Trump the Patriots</text>
  <text start="733.86" dur="4.92">are going to be stopping this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="736.53" dur="4.26">going to be bringing down the Fed but</text>
  <text start="738.78" dur="5.37">one thing we need to understand is that</text>
  <text start="740.79" dur="4.44">once they bring down the Fed and they</text>
  <text start="744.15" dur="4.53">said they were going to bring down the</text>
  <text start="745.23" dur="6.75">Fed using gold and there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="748.68" dur="6.84">restructuring of the Fed once the Fed is</text>
  <text start="751.98" dur="6.21">brought down the dollar their Federal</text>
  <text start="755.52" dur="6.63">Reserve Note will no longer be the</text>
  <text start="758.19" dur="7.74">reserve currency of the world and this</text>
  <text start="762.15" dur="7.89">means that something else either has to</text>
  <text start="765.93" dur="8.19">take its place or every country uses its</text>
  <text start="770.04" dur="5.82">own currency and I do believe that a lot</text>
  <text start="774.12" dur="3.63">of the central bank&amp;#39;s the private</text>
  <text start="775.86" dur="5.49">western central banks they will be</text>
  <text start="777.75" dur="5.64">destroyed and a lot of the countries the</text>
  <text start="781.35" dur="5.13">people of the country will create their</text>
  <text start="783.39" dur="6.68">own currency actually going back about a</text>
  <text start="786.48" dur="8.79">year ago Lavrov said every country</text>
  <text start="790.07" dur="9.07">should use their own currency instead of</text>
  <text start="795.27" dur="6.78">using the dollar or an SDR or something</text>
  <text start="799.14" dur="4.89">like that which i think is a very good</text>
  <text start="802.05" dur="5.97">idea remember the central bank model is</text>
  <text start="804.03" dur="5.4">to have a one currency system that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="808.02" dur="3.9">what they tried to do with the Federal</text>
  <text start="809.43" dur="5.04">Reserve and they were hoping once that</text>
  <text start="811.92" dur="4.68">ran its time and the whole thing</text>
  <text start="814.47" dur="3.9">imploded they were going to move us into</text>
  <text start="816.6" dur="3.81">something else that really wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="818.37" dur="5.97">attached probably to a country</text>
  <text start="820.41" dur="6.77">it was just a central bank currency</text>
  <text start="824.34" dur="6.46">system that they completely controlled</text>
  <text start="827.18" dur="4.73">but we know that Russia and China</text>
  <text start="830.8" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;ve been telegraphing that</text>
  <text start="831.91" dur="3.48">something&amp;#39;s going to happen with the</text>
  <text start="834.1" dur="3.33">dollar in that this is going back a</text>
  <text start="835.39" dur="4.259">couple of years they&amp;#39;ve been buying gold</text>
  <text start="837.43" dur="5.4">and they created their own payment</text>
  <text start="839.649" dur="5.731">system China has and Russia has then we</text>
  <text start="842.83" dur="6.3">heard Europe was going to create their</text>
  <text start="845.38" dur="7.019">own payment system and now the BRICS</text>
  <text start="849.13" dur="6.93">they are deciding to create their own</text>
  <text start="852.399" dur="6.361">payment system call BRICS pay so we have</text>
  <text start="856.06" dur="5.49">Europe Russia China they all have their</text>
  <text start="858.76" dur="6.569">individual pay payment systems then we</text>
  <text start="861.55" dur="6.69">have BRICS pay so this tells us that</text>
  <text start="865.329" dur="6.901">they&amp;#39;re prepared and ready to come off</text>
  <text start="868.24" dur="9.12">the Swift system if the entire system</text>
  <text start="872.23" dur="8.84">breaks down what they&amp;#39;re telling us is</text>
  <text start="877.36" dur="8.28">that they&amp;#39;re getting prepared for a</text>
  <text start="881.07" dur="7.9">complete switch away from the Federal</text>
  <text start="885.64" dur="4.889">Reserve Note and like we said once Trump</text>
  <text start="888.97" dur="6">and the Patriots bring the Federal</text>
  <text start="890.529" dur="7.381">Reserve to its knees yes we will take it</text>
  <text start="894.97" dur="5.64">over as a nation we will create our own</text>
  <text start="897.91" dur="5.01">currency without interest attached but</text>
  <text start="900.61" dur="4.65">most likely it&amp;#39;s going to be a local</text>
  <text start="902.92" dur="6.87">currency it&amp;#39;s not going to be a world</text>
  <text start="905.26" dur="6.15">currency in every other country well</text>
  <text start="909.79" dur="3.93">most likely they&amp;#39;re gonna be using their</text>
  <text start="911.41" dur="4.35">own currencies and I think a lot of</text>
  <text start="913.72" dur="5.58">countries are gonna back their currency</text>
  <text start="915.76" dur="5.67">with gold I believe that the United</text>
  <text start="919.3" dur="6.3">States might back the currency with gold</text>
  <text start="921.43" dur="6.33">or use it as a confidence builder so</text>
  <text start="925.6" dur="3.87">countries around the world</text>
  <text start="927.76" dur="5.03">they&amp;#39;ve been telegraphing this message</text>
  <text start="929.47" dur="6.869">for quite a while and we know from cue</text>
  <text start="932.79" dur="5.26">this is the move they&amp;#39;re going to make</text>
