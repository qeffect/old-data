  <text start="144.08" dur="4.47">Fed the credibility to proceed with the</text>

  <text start="148.55" dur="4.469">to start recalculating this you know</text>
  <text start="150.849" dur="4.481">cutting away the things they don&amp;#39;t need</text>

  <text start="165.09" dur="3.239">all certain different things like</text>
  <text start="166.89" dur="3.75">research and development and they</text>
  <text start="168.329" dur="5.25">recalculated GDP all the way up to the</text>
  <text start="170.64" dur="4.29">present time to give us a positive GDP</text>
  <text start="173.579" dur="3.841">number but everything they&amp;#39;ve done in</text>
  <text start="174.93" dur="4.619">the past is not working out now because</text>
  <text start="177.42" dur="4.439">the economy is completely falling apart</text>
  <text start="179.549" dur="4.291">it is imploding and they realize this</text>
  <text start="181.859" dur="5.011">but they need to keep this going a</text>
  <text start="183.84" dur="4.83">little bit longer they needed because</text>
  <text start="186.87" dur="3.27">they are planning an event they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="188.67" dur="3.72">getting ready to blame this on another</text>
  <text start="190.14" dur="5.219">group or country and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="192.39" dur="5.159">trying to prop this up longer and longer</text>
  <text start="195.359" dur="4.77">and we can see them doing this every</text>
  <text start="197.549" dur="5.881">single time in the meanwhile we see what</text>
  <text start="200.129" dur="5.791">Russia is doing Russia right now has</text>
  <text start="203.43" dur="4.41">their national pay payment card which</text>
  <text start="205.92" dur="4.56">will come into operation by the end of</text>
  <text start="207.84" dur="4.83">the year the card will also operate</text>
  <text start="210.48" dur="4.14">abroad within a year and this is like</text>
  <text start="212.67" dur="4.219">Visa MasterCard they&amp;#39;ll do the</text>
  <text start="214.62" dur="5.369">processing they also have their in-house</text>
  <text start="216.889" dur="6.761">processing that they will do and their</text>
  <text start="219.989" dur="6.33">plan is for the national payment card it</text>
  <text start="223.65" dur="5.429">will work in co-branding with for</text>
  <text start="226.319" dur="6.53">payment system the Chinese UnionPay</text>
  <text start="229.079" dur="6.391">Japan&amp;#39;s JCP and with Visa and MasterCard</text>
  <text start="232.849" dur="4.991">the first nationwide payment card is</text>
  <text start="235.47" dur="5.879">aimed to protect Russian hard holders</text>
  <text start="237.84" dur="5.7">and provide with a constant payment</text>
  <text start="241.349" dur="3.72">transactions within the country outside</text>
  <text start="243.54" dur="3.509">the country will be served by</text>
  <text start="245.069" dur="3.6">international systems Visa and</text>
  <text start="247.049" dur="4.981">MasterCard signed an agreement to carry</text>
  <text start="248.669" dur="5.46">out transactions via the npcs processing</text>
  <text start="252.03" dur="4.079">center and settling through the bank of</text>
  <text start="254.129" dur="4.681">russia so they&amp;#39;re getting prepared ready</text>
  <text start="256.109" dur="4.651">to completely detach themselves from the</text>
  <text start="258.81" dur="4.079">private western central bank countries</text>
  <text start="260.76" dur="5.399">they want to be independent and where</text>
  <text start="262.889" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;re moving in this direction we see</text>
  <text start="266.159" dur="5.401">China they have just announced the</text>
  <text start="269.159" dur="6.091">establishment of a new international</text>
  <text start="271.56" dur="7.47">gold fund with over 60 countries as</text>
  <text start="275.25" dur="6.449">members and they&amp;#39;re looking to raise at</text>
  <text start="279.03" dur="5.31">least sixteen billion dollars they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="281.699" dur="5.041">going to use this to facilitate the</text>
  <text start="284.34" dur="8.21">central banks of all these member states</text>
  <text start="286.74" dur="7.95">to acquire more gold for their reserves</text>
  <text start="292.55" dur="3.49">so we can see what they&amp;#39;re doing at this</text>
  <text start="294.69" dur="3.87">point they&amp;#39;re getting prepared</text>
  <text start="296.04" dur="5.91">they want all these countries to take on</text>
  <text start="298.56" dur="7.41">more gold because they want to set the</text>
  <text start="301.95" dur="6.3">price of gold down the line and we can</text>
  <text start="305.97" dur="4.29">see right now the 60 countries have</text>
  <text start="308.25" dur="4.2">invested in the fund which will in turn</text>
  <text start="310.26" dur="4.86">facilitate gold purchase for the central</text>
  <text start="312.45" dur="4.92">banks of member states to increase their</text>
  <text start="315.12" dur="4.02">gold holding of precious metal the</text>
  <text start="317.37" dur="4.41">project is being overseen by the</text>
  <text start="319.14" dur="3.87">shanghai gold exchange the Chinese</text>
  <text start="321.78" dur="3.93">government seeks to increase the</text>
  <text start="323.01" dur="4.56">influence of the yuan in gold pricing by</text>
  <text start="325.71" dur="4.74">opening the domestic gold market to</text>
  <text start="327.57" dur="6.6">international investors coupled with the</text>
  <text start="330.45" dur="5.82">brics bank and the AAA aiib power in the</text>
  <text start="334.17" dur="4.71">region and internationally is now</text>
  <text start="336.27" dur="5.34">strengthening and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="338.88" dur="5.43">trying to pull the carpet from under the</text>
  <text start="341.61" dur="5.67">comex from the private western central</text>
  <text start="344.31" dur="6.75">bank system and down the line it looks</text>
  <text start="347.28" dur="7.95">like they want to be the entire system</text>
  <text start="351.06" dur="7.47">that sets the gold price now out in</text>
  <text start="355.23" dur="6.21">Afghanistan we understand the United</text>
  <text start="358.53" dur="5.04">States NATO they are never leaving that</text>
  <text start="361.44" dur="6.14">area I mean that has been established at</text>
  <text start="363.57" dur="9.02">this point we see right now that the</text>
  <text start="367.58" dur="9.24">Taliban and an Afghan peace envoy</text>
  <text start="372.59" dur="8.41">they&amp;#39;ve held secret meetings in China</text>
  <text start="376.82" dur="6.07">negotiating peace and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="381" dur="4.17">have to watch and see how that goes in</text>
  <text start="382.89" dur="3.84">the meantime what do we see we see the</text>
  <text start="385.17" dur="4.98">United States continually keeping troops</text>
  <text start="386.73" dur="5.45">there adding more troops we see NATO the</text>
  <text start="390.15" dur="3.99">commander General John Campbell is</text>
  <text start="392.18" dur="3.79">reporting that the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="394.14" dur="4.5">making some inroads recruiting in</text>
  <text start="395.97" dur="4.74">Afghanistan and Pakistan and what they</text>
  <text start="398.64" dur="4.83">are saying at this point is that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="400.71" dur="6.47">going to keep troops past twenty sixteen</text>
  <text start="403.47" dur="8.1">so NATO right now is saying that their</text>
  <text start="407.18" dur="6.55">occupation of Afghanistan is basically</text>
  <text start="411.57" dur="3.81">open-ended and they&amp;#39;re going to keep</text>
  <text start="413.73" dur="3.69">troops there and they might have to add</text>
  <text start="415.38" dur="3.63">additional troops because they see the</text>
  <text start="417.42" dur="4.62">Islamic state expanding and we know the</text>
  <text start="419.01" dur="5.909">Islamic state is a proxy army for the</text>
  <text start="422.04" dur="5.4">United States government Israel UK and</text>
  <text start="424.919" dur="4.711">other nations to create chaos in the</text>
  <text start="427.44" dur="5.84">region and also wherever they are</text>
  <text start="429.63" dur="6.21">this is where the coalition can go to</text>

  <text start="446.76" dur="5.64">haram al-shabaab al-qaeda so wherever</text>
  <text start="449.52" dur="7.23">these terrorist groups are that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="452.4" dur="6.17">the United States can go and if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="456.75" dur="4.98">in a country where they need to get into</text>
  <text start="458.57" dur="5.86">they&amp;#39;ll set up their little Islamic</text>

  <text start="464.43" dur="5.19">area and tell everyone that yes they are</text>

  <text start="516.75" dur="6.09">privatization campaign in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="520.13" dur="4.96">particularly in the energy sector so</text>
  <text start="522.84" dur="5.28">basically the central bankers right now</text>
  <text start="525.09" dur="5.82">are now selling off bits and pieces of</text>

  <text start="543.2" dur="5.29">privatization as well as the process of</text>
  <text start="546.39" dur="6.39">Ukraine&amp;#39;s economic recovery so we can</text>

  <text start="687.12" dur="6.09">missiles that have come down with the</text>
  <text start="691.38" dur="3.389">plane and they&amp;#39;re saying they have the</text>
  <text start="693.21" dur="7.14">ability to use them if</text>
  <text start="694.769" dur="8.091">needed we see out in Libya the United</text>
  <text start="700.35" dur="7.38">States government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="702.86" dur="6.639">getting ready to go in to Libya just</text>
  <text start="707.73" dur="3.18">like Yemen now will it be the United</text>
  <text start="709.499" dur="2.88">States government actually going in</text>
  <text start="710.91" dur="3.45">there now it&amp;#39;d probably be the coalition</text>
  <text start="712.379" dur="4.14">forces we understand there&amp;#39;s a couple of</text>
  <text start="714.36" dur="4.829">countries preparing and getting ready</text>
  <text start="716.519" dur="6.74">and like I said in the past they will</text>
  <text start="719.189" dur="6.481">not allow oil to be sold if it&amp;#39;s not on</text>
  <text start="723.259" dur="5.651">the dollar if they&amp;#39;re trying to sell it</text>
  <text start="725.67" dur="6.779">using the you on the ruble the euro gold</text>
  <text start="728.91" dur="4.709">silver they will not let it out of that</text>
  <text start="732.449" dur="4.08">country and right now looks like</text>
  <text start="733.619" dur="5.46">warplanes have attacked an oil tanker</text>
  <text start="736.529" dur="6.441">that was docked and they&amp;#39;re saying they</text>
  <text start="739.079" dur="6.66">attacked it because they were weapons</text>
  <text start="742.97" dur="5.26">ammunition on the planes but they have</text>
  <text start="745.739" dur="5.22">no proof of it whatsoever basically this</text>
  <text start="748.23" dur="4.859">is a cover story because they probably</text>
  <text start="750.959" dur="3.42">brought the tanker in they were about to</text>
  <text start="753.089" dur="4.23">load it up with oil they were probably</text>
  <text start="754.379" dur="5.731">going to sell it not using the dollar</text>
  <text start="757.319" dur="5.52">and basically they destroyed the tanker</text>
  <text start="760.11" dur="4.529">we saw this happen once before where</text>
  <text start="762.839" dur="4.771">they actually loaded the tanker up with</text>
  <text start="764.639" dur="7.41">oil and the people of Libya had the</text>
  <text start="767.61" dur="8.279">tanker leave port set sail and the US</text>
  <text start="772.049" dur="6.5">SEAL team came on board and brought the</text>
  <text start="775.889" dur="5.67">tanker right back this has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="778.549" dur="5.08">with anything else except they will not</text>
  <text start="781.559" dur="4.95">allow this oil to be sold not using the</text>
  <text start="783.629" dur="6.361">dollar that&amp;#39;s it we see the Libyan</text>
  <text start="786.509" dur="6.57">government right now is continually</text>
  <text start="789.99" dur="4.649">trying to take control of the country</text>
  <text start="793.079" dur="4.2">now this is the internationally</text>
  <text start="794.639" dur="3.93">recognized government but again as we</text>
  <text start="797.279" dur="3.15">know the people through this government</text>
  <text start="798.569" dur="3.75">out and they&amp;#39;ve taken over the country</text>
  <text start="800.429" dur="3.69">and we see many other nations right now</text>
  <text start="802.319" dur="3.57">getting prepared and ready to go in</text>
  <text start="804.119" dur="3.481">there they&amp;#39;re trying to have peace talks</text>
  <text start="805.889" dur="3.63">with the UN but they&amp;#39;re not going so</text>
  <text start="807.6" dur="4.769">well and they are breaking down an</text>
  <text start="809.519" dur="4.92">Iranian general out in Iraq is saying</text>
  <text start="812.369" dur="4.77">listen the US did absolutely nothing to</text>
  <text start="814.439" dur="5.63">help the situation in Ramadi where</text>
  <text start="817.139" dur="7.2">supposedly the Islamic state you know</text>
  <text start="820.069" dur="6.07">was there and they basically took over</text>
  <text start="824.339" dur="4.231">that whole region basically was the the</text>
  <text start="826.139" dur="7.051">people in that area that</text>
  <text start="828.57" dur="6.48">when in took it over and the US couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="833.19" dur="5.28">do anything about it whatsoever they do</text>
  <text start="835.05" dur="6.24">not have the resources set up and ready</text>
  <text start="838.47" dur="4.55">to go they have a small number of troops</text>
  <text start="841.29" dur="4.8">on the ground at this point and</text>
  <text start="843.02" dur="5.89">basically US troops or rocky troops they</text>
  <text start="846.09" dur="5.46">all fled because the number of people</text>
  <text start="848.91" dur="5.31">that were coming in was too great for</text>
  <text start="851.55" dur="4.08">them to keep back and Iran is looking at</text>
  <text start="854.22" dur="4.77">the situation and saying they did</text>
  <text start="855.63" dur="5.73">absolutely nothing and nobody wants a</text>
  <text start="858.99" dur="5.82">report on that this is the same thing</text>
  <text start="861.36" dur="7.05">happening in Yemen in Lebanon in Libya</text>
  <text start="864.81" dur="5.61">and in Iraq where the people are sick</text>
  <text start="868.41" dur="5.7">and tired of the puppet regime and they</text>
  <text start="870.42" dur="6.57">are rising up we see McCain is out there</text>
  <text start="874.11" dur="6.18">saying the situation in Iraq is getting</text>
  <text start="876.99" dur="5.97">out of hand it is time for the u.s. to</text>
  <text start="880.29" dur="4.29">put boots on the ground and maintain</text>
  <text start="882.96" dur="3.57">control so basically the United States</text>
  <text start="884.58" dur="4.77">is going to invade Iraq what this is the</text>
  <text start="886.53" dur="4.05">fourth time now and this is what they</text>
  <text start="889.35" dur="3.21">want to do because eventually what they</text>
  <text start="890.58" dur="4.2">want to do is bring those troops into</text>
  <text start="892.56" dur="5.34">Syria they&amp;#39;re getting ready to create</text>
  <text start="894.78" dur="4.92">safe havens inside Syria because what</text>
  <text start="897.9" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re saying is all that territory</text>
  <text start="899.7" dur="2.31">that the Islamic state which is the</text>
  <text start="900.96" dur="3.66">proxy army of the United States</text>
  <text start="902.01" dur="4.68">government Israel UK and other nations</text>
  <text start="904.62" dur="6.9">basically it&amp;#39;s the Free Syrian Army up</text>
  <text start="906.69" dur="8.04">in Syria they have taken over that area</text>
  <text start="911.52" dur="6.66">and they want to create a separate state</text>
  <text start="914.73" dur="5.85">and say this is a different part of</text>
  <text start="918.18" dur="4.83">Syria it&amp;#39;s a safe haven and this way the</text>
  <text start="920.58" dur="4.77">US troops can maneuver into this area</text>
  <text start="923.01" dur="5.88">and then eventually make their attacks</text>
  <text start="925.35" dur="6.51">on Damascus and try to go after Assad</text>
  <text start="928.89" dur="5.63">now all of this is now coming out that</text>
  <text start="931.86" dur="5.88">yes the United skate the United States</text>
  <text start="934.52" dur="6.82">actually did create the Islamic state it</text>
  <text start="937.74" dur="7.5">was a newly declassified us document the</text>
  <text start="941.34" dur="5.58">Pentagon secret Pentagon report revealed</text>
  <text start="945.24" dur="7.89">that the West saw the Islamic state as a</text>
  <text start="946.92" dur="7.89">strategic asset in removing Assad so it</text>
  <text start="953.13" dur="4.2">seems that all this information is now</text>
  <text start="954.81" dur="4.68">coming out we&amp;#39;re starting to realize</text>
  <text start="957.33" dur="4.32">that all along we were right that yes</text>
  <text start="959.49" dur="2.91">the Islamic state is controlled by the</text>
  <text start="961.65" dur="3.72">US</text>
  <text start="962.4" dur="5.82">by Israel by UK and other nations to</text>
  <text start="965.37" dur="5.16">eventually put in a pipeline which</text>
  <text start="968.22" dur="5.07">guitar would like to do with the help of</text>
  <text start="970.53" dur="5.76">the US and Israel they want to take out</text>
  <text start="973.29" dur="5.25">Assad capture the natural resources put</text>
  <text start="976.29" dur="5.79">all the oil on the dollar and then go</text>
  <text start="978.54" dur="7.05">after Iran now if the p5 plus one talks</text>
  <text start="982.08" dur="5.46">don&amp;#39;t allow the bankers to get in there</text>
  <text start="985.59" dur="4.02">take over their central bank put all</text>
  <text start="987.54" dur="4.47">their natural resources on the dollar we</text>
  <text start="989.61" dur="6.21">will see something go down in this area</text>
  <text start="992.01" dur="5.94">and we will see the United States</text>
  <text start="995.82" dur="4.35">government invade one way or another</text>
  <text start="997.95" dur="4.95">maybe with a proxy army like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1000.17" dur="4.71">doing in Yemen but we will see it</text>
  <text start="1002.9" dur="6.24">happened because this is their goal they</text>
  <text start="1004.88" dur="7.14">never go in an opposite direction they</text>
  <text start="1009.14" dur="5.16">always file follow their golds and the</text>
  <text start="1012.02" dur="5.04">only thing that changes is their tactics</text>
  <text start="1014.3" dur="5.94">so they will follow the goal we have to</text>
  <text start="1017.06" dur="4.83">understand going back to Wesley Clark</text>
  <text start="1020.24" dur="4.32">where he said the last two countries</text>
  <text start="1021.89" dur="4.319">were Syria and Iraq and Iran and what</text>
  <text start="1024.56" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re trying to do right now is get</text>
  <text start="1026.209" dur="4.621">into these two countries use the</text>
  <text start="1028.43" dur="4.26">authorization war of war to get back</text>
  <text start="1030.83" dur="3.93">into those other countries where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1032.69" dur="3.78">losing their losing the puppet</text>
  <text start="1034.76" dur="3.75">governments and they need to take over</text>
  <text start="1036.47" dur="4.8">this entire area and eventually they</text>
  <text start="1038.51" dur="6.42">would love to separate these countries</text>
  <text start="1041.27" dur="6">into Shiite Kurdish and Sunni and this</text>
  <text start="1044.93" dur="6">is their main goal to keep the dollar</text>
  <text start="1047.27" dur="5.76">prompt up and continually kids to</text>
  <text start="1050.93" dur="3.42">continually keep it going for a longer</text>
  <text start="1053.03" dur="4.05">period of time but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1054.35" dur="4.26">right now it is not going as planned and</text>
  <text start="1057.08" dur="4.38">things are definitely falling apart</text>
  <text start="1058.61" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;re losing the war in Yemen they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1061.46" dur="6.75">losing in Libya they&amp;#39;re losing in</text>
  <text start="1064.34" dur="5.34">Lebanon Iraq is falling apart and the</text>
  <text start="1068.21" dur="3.54">whole entire thing is falling apart</text>
  <text start="1069.68" dur="4.47">because you have to remember when these</text>
  <text start="1071.75" dur="5.43">countries stop using the dollar to pay</text>
  <text start="1074.15" dur="5.25">for the oil other countries will not</text>
  <text start="1077.18" dur="3.96">have to keep it in reserves the dollar</text>
  <text start="1079.4" dur="4.08">will then come back to the US they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="1081.14" dur="5.19">a flood of US dollars that will devalue</text>
  <text start="1083.48" dur="4.71">the dollar then we will see inflation in</text>
  <text start="1086.33" dur="4.05">this country and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="1088.19" dur="5.52">this happen right now where other</text>
  <text start="1090.38" dur="5.62">countries are not using the dollar for</text>
  <text start="1093.71" dur="4.78">commerce they&amp;#39;re using their own current</text>
  <text start="1096" dur="5.76">these we see countries moving away from</text>
  <text start="1098.49" dur="5.58">the dollar and all of this is starting</text>
  <text start="1101.76" dur="5.04">to accelerate as we go down the line the</text>
  <text start="1104.07" dur="6.36">economy is not holding up it is falling</text>
  <text start="1106.8" dur="6.15">apart they&amp;#39;re manipulating recalculating</text>
  <text start="1110.43" dur="4.29">so we continually have these illusionary</text>
  <text start="1112.95" dur="4.59">numbers to prove that we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="1114.72" dur="5.46">recovery but again there illusionary but</text>
  <text start="1117.54" dur="4.11">it convinces the masses and that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1120.18" dur="3.9">they need at this point in time and</text>
  <text start="1121.65" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re getting ready and preparing for</text>
  <text start="1124.08" dur="7.29">this event to pretty much cover up this</text>
  <text start="1127.08" dur="5.79">entire collapse of the country of their</text>
  <text start="1131.37" dur="3.18">system and this is going to happen in</text>
  <text start="1132.87" dur="3.06">Europe it&amp;#39;s going to happen in Canada</text>
  <text start="1134.55" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s going to happen in Australia and</text>
  <text start="1135.93" dur="6.12">the US it&amp;#39;s a cascading effect they will</text>
  <text start="1140.07" dur="3.65">not be able to stop it they have been</text>
  <text start="1142.05" dur="5.85">preparing they&amp;#39;ve been getting ready and</text>
