  <text start="42.589" dur="4.731">going to be talking there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="43.79" dur="7.47">lot of stuff happening and it looks like</text>
  <text start="47.32" dur="7.87">the central bankers the government they</text>
  <text start="51.26" dur="7.89">are definitely preparing to do something</text>
  <text start="55.19" dur="6.899">because what has been going on seems to</text>
  <text start="59.15" dur="7.289">be a rush and it seems like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="62.089" dur="6.361">trying to get things in place and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="66.439" dur="4.471">just go through it and we can discuss it</text>
  <text start="68.45" dur="4.86">and see you know what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening</text>

  <text start="73.31" dur="4.8">disconnect now we all notice the soaring</text>
  <text start="75.56" dur="5.28">markets troubled economies the stock</text>
  <text start="78.11" dur="5.58">market has no bearing on the economy</text>
  <text start="80.84" dur="5.46">whatsoever it&amp;#39;s not a reflection of how</text>
  <text start="83.69" dur="5.39">the economy is doing it is completely</text>
  <text start="86.3" dur="6.75">separate and apart and it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="89.08" dur="6.82">it&amp;#39;s controlled by the Fed and the banks</text>
  <text start="93.05" dur="8.88">and it has nothing to do with reality</text>
  <text start="95.9" dur="8.91">and basically it goes on to say that the</text>
  <text start="101.93" dur="5.34">central bank&amp;#39;s run today&amp;#39;s world major</text>
  <text start="104.81" dur="8.87">ones matter most money printing madness</text>
  <text start="107.27" dur="9.99">controls everything and you know the</text>
  <text start="113.68" dur="5.89">these central bankers are more powerful</text>
  <text start="117.26" dur="4.26">than standing armies they can levitate</text>
  <text start="119.57" dur="4.86">markets they can enrich themselves at</text>
  <text start="121.52" dur="5.79">the same time they can do it while</text>
  <text start="124.43" dur="5.609">economies crater the power of masses</text>
  <text start="127.31" dur="5.28">massive liquidity infusions combined</text>
  <text start="130.039" dur="5.701">with with market manipulation generates</text>
  <text start="132.59" dur="4.32">huge profits the bond market stock</text>
  <text start="135.74" dur="3.78">market in the u.s.</text>
  <text start="136.91" dur="5.1">there are levitating something&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="139.52" dur="5.1">to go and something&amp;#39;s going to pop this</text>
  <text start="142.01" dur="5.37">is possibly one of the riskiest years in</text>
  <text start="144.62" dur="5.52">Western civilization&amp;#39;s nothing can</text>
  <text start="147.38" dur="5.46">accelerate forever at some point the</text>
  <text start="150.14" dur="6.09">acceleration stops and when it does the</text>
  <text start="152.84" dur="6.87">market breaks and collapse and we can</text>
  <text start="156.23" dur="6.21">see this going on and basically if we</text>
  <text start="159.71" dur="7.2">look back in history we can see this too</text>
  <text start="162.44" dur="7.89">we can see in 2008 the stock market was</text>
  <text start="166.91" dur="6.96">at its highest point we can see back in</text>
  <text start="170.33" dur="5.49">1929 the stock market was at its highest</text>
  <text start="173.87" dur="4.65">point we can go back to two thousand one</text>
  <text start="175.82" dur="5.72">and we can see the stock market was at</text>
  <text start="178.52" dur="7.29">its highest point and these crashes</text>
  <text start="181.54" dur="8.4">reflect the the pumping up of the bubble</text>
  <text start="185.81" dur="8.01">and now we have a complete disconnect of</text>
  <text start="189.94" dur="5.74">the stock market I mean the volume of</text>
  <text start="193.82" dur="5.31">the stock market is so low there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.68" dur="5.96">hardly any people in the market trading</text>
  <text start="199.13" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s mostly institutional investors</text>
  <text start="201.64" dur="5.62">receiving and actually banks receiving</text>
  <text start="204.56" dur="7.41">this free cheap money from the Fed and</text>
  <text start="207.26" dur="8.34">buying socks with it and you can see</text>
  <text start="211.97" dur="6.72">that we are definitely coming to the</text>
  <text start="215.6" dur="6.68">point where things are starting to rip</text>
  <text start="218.69" dur="7.38">apart and things are are going to start</text>
  <text start="222.28" dur="6.76">escalating and we should see this by the</text>
  <text start="226.07" dur="6.87">more taxes they pass the more things the</text>
  <text start="229.04" dur="5.85">more laws which constrict the people the</text>
  <text start="232.94" dur="4.019">more they do this and the faster they do</text>
  <text start="234.89" dur="4.73">this this is how we know we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="236.959" dur="6.451">closer and closer to this collapse now</text>
  <text start="239.62" dur="5.5">we know the debt ceiling is at sixteen</text>
  <text start="243.41" dur="4.5">point eight trillion dollars right now</text>
  <text start="245.12" dur="4.44">and basically you know the US government</text>
  <text start="247.91" dur="4.829">does what it does best it basically</text>
  <text start="249.56" dur="7.429">suspended the ceiling so now there is no</text>
  <text start="252.739" dur="7.381">limit and they&amp;#39;ll revisit this back in</text>
  <text start="256.989" dur="5.951">when&amp;#39;s the Labor Day September second or</text>
  <text start="260.12" dur="6.44">something like that let me see here yeah</text>
  <text start="262.94" dur="7.32">September second they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll revisit</text>
  <text start="266.56" dur="5.16">the debt problem now what</text>
  <text start="270.26" dur="3">difference between now and then</text>
  <text start="271.72" dur="3.81">basically they&amp;#39;re just going to be</text>
  <text start="273.26" dur="5.27">adding to the debt do you really think</text>
  <text start="275.53" dur="5.77">now they keep doing this think about</text>
  <text start="278.53" dur="9.28">2008 let&amp;#39;s just go back to two thousand</text>
  <text start="281.3" dur="9.24">eight till now have a ever addressed the</text>
  <text start="287.81" dur="5.34">debt problem never you know what they</text>
  <text start="290.54" dur="5.22">did they push it off 2010 they pushed it</text>
  <text start="293.15" dur="5.85">off 2011 they suspended the debt ceiling</text>
  <text start="295.76" dur="5.64">they had automatic sequester cuts and</text>
  <text start="299" dur="5.91">what did those really do anyone feeling</text>
  <text start="301.4" dur="8.22">any problems anywhere no but guess what</text>
  <text start="304.91" dur="7.17">the debt is continually going up and I</text>
  <text start="309.62" dur="6.99">took a snapshot of the u.s. debt clock</text>
  <text start="312.08" dur="7.08">and I put that on set no alerts and if</text>
  <text start="316.61" dur="8.28">you go there and you see it it it is</text>
  <text start="319.16" dur="11.25">completely stopped at 16.8 trillion and</text>
  <text start="324.89" dur="7.83">change and basically the debt just</text>
  <text start="330.41" dur="5.19">continually goes up and up and up and it</text>
  <text start="332.72" dur="5.37">doesn&amp;#39;t stop I&amp;#39;m sorry I didn&amp;#39;t put that</text>
  <text start="335.6" dur="5.34">in setting the Lord&amp;#39;s I put that on the</text>
  <text start="338.09" dur="6.39">people and I believe it was the</text>
  <text start="340.94" dur="5.1">financial news section so correction</text>
  <text start="344.48" dur="4.11">there so if you&amp;#39;re going to look for it</text>
  <text start="346.04" dur="4.86">on sent alerts you won&amp;#39;t find it it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="348.59" dur="5.61">the financial news section and I start</text>
  <text start="350.9" dur="5.94">and the snapshot was today and it was in</text>
  <text start="354.2" dur="6.18">the morning around nine fifteen in the</text>
  <text start="356.84" dur="6.66">morning and it was 16.8 three trillion</text>
  <text start="360.38" dur="5.34">dollars and if we go to the u.s. debt</text>
  <text start="363.5" dur="5.37">clock right now let&amp;#39;s just see from 950</text>
  <text start="365.72" dur="7.95">this morning until now the difference</text>
  <text start="368.87" dur="9.09">between the two it was 16.8 three and</text>
  <text start="373.67" dur="7.53">now it&amp;#39;s 16.8 31 already so by the end</text>
  <text start="377.96" dur="6.33">of today it&amp;#39;s gonna go up another what</text>
  <text start="381.2" dur="7.56">is that two billion dollars I mean</text>
  <text start="384.29" dur="5.76">unbelievable but you know it&amp;#39;s no big</text>
  <text start="388.76" dur="3.33">deal it&amp;#39;s almost like having an</text>
  <text start="390.05" dur="3.87">unlimited credit card and you just keep</text>
  <text start="392.09" dur="3.24">on you know you&amp;#39;re making fifty thousand</text>
  <text start="393.92" dur="5.04">dollars a year but your credit card is</text>
  <text start="395.33" dur="5.04">up to 225,000 now you keep making the</text>
  <text start="398.96" dur="3.27">interest payments but sooner or later</text>
  <text start="400.37" dur="3.73">guess what happens you can&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="402.23" dur="7.18">anymore it&amp;#39;s impossible</text>
  <text start="404.1" dur="9.63">double okay let&amp;#39;s move on here now there</text>
  <text start="409.41" dur="6.06">was a bank run in Brazil in Brazil the</text>
  <text start="413.73" dur="4.41">social security fund called bolsa</text>
  <text start="415.47" dur="4.41">família was to be cancelled led</text>
  <text start="418.14" dur="3.06">thousands of people to rush to withdraw</text>
  <text start="419.88" dur="3.69">money from Brazilian banks over the</text>
  <text start="421.2" dur="7.29">weekend and their banks are not open so</text>
  <text start="423.57" dur="6.75">they all ran into the ran to the ATMs to</text>
  <text start="428.49" dur="3.21">get as much money as they possibly could</text>
  <text start="430.32" dur="4.34">because they were afraid that they</text>
  <text start="431.7" dur="5.85">weren&amp;#39;t going to be getting their money</text>
  <text start="434.66" dur="9.96">from this social security the bolsa</text>
  <text start="437.55" dur="11.1">família fund and if the banks were open</text>
  <text start="444.62" dur="7.42">a lot more money would have gone out of</text>
  <text start="448.65" dur="6.45">these bangs but look how quickly the</text>
  <text start="452.04" dur="8.04">point of this is look how quickly just</text>
  <text start="455.1" dur="9.44">from a simple rumor how fast a bunk a</text>
  <text start="460.08" dur="8.01">bank run could happen just think if a</text>
  <text start="464.54" dur="6.85">second from now the government says</text>
  <text start="468.09" dur="5.97">we&amp;#39;re defaulting on the debt all banks</text>
  <text start="471.39" dur="6.18">are insolvent we will be taking your</text>
  <text start="474.06" dur="6.72">money what do you think would happen it</text>
  <text start="477.57" dur="5.69">would be rioting and people running to</text>
  <text start="480.78" dur="7.65">the banks trying to get their money and</text>
  <text start="483.26" dur="9.61">it would be crazy and it just takes one</text>
  <text start="488.43" dur="8.34">little piece of news to have this entire</text>
  <text start="492.87" dur="7.28">house of cards come tumbling down that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="496.77" dur="7.67">all it takes that&amp;#39;s how fragile this is</text>
  <text start="500.15" dur="7.95">now the bis and the IMF attacks on</text>
  <text start="504.44" dur="5.95">quantitative easing deeply misguided</text>
  <text start="508.1" dur="6.49">they&amp;#39;re basically what they go on to say</text>
  <text start="510.39" dur="6.029">is they&amp;#39;re saying that across the world</text>
  <text start="514.59" dur="3.18">have worn that International Monetary</text>
  <text start="516.419" dur="3.391">Fund and the bank for international</text>
  <text start="517.77" dur="4.05">sediment settlements are making an</text>
  <text start="519.81" dur="4.08">historic error by calling for a</text>
  <text start="521.82" dur="4.29">withdrawal of emergency stimulus before</text>
  <text start="523.89" dur="4.68">the global economic economy has fully</text>
  <text start="526.11" dur="4.56">recovered and we know this the central</text>
  <text start="528.57" dur="4.2">bank&amp;#39;s the Fed they want to stop</text>
  <text start="530.67" dur="3.78">quantitative easing and basically</text>
  <text start="532.77" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re saying you&amp;#39;re out of your</text>
  <text start="534.45" dur="3.48">freaking minds if we stop this</text>
  <text start="536.49" dur="4.74">everything&amp;#39;s going to collapse</text>
  <text start="537.93" dur="4.59">now it makes no sense and it goes on to</text>
  <text start="541.23" dur="4.01">say the two watch dogs launched</text>
  <text start="542.52" dur="6.23">broadsides against central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="545.24" dur="7.15">largest last week the central bank</text>
  <text start="548.75" dur="5.17">largest last week the biz the form of</text>
  <text start="552.39" dur="3.09">central banks was particularly blunt</text>
  <text start="553.92" dur="5.1">seemingly to imply that quantitative</text>
  <text start="555.48" dur="5.609">easing does not work the IMF and bids</text>
  <text start="559.02" dur="4.14">are deeply misguided and risk doing the</text>
  <text start="561.089" dur="4.111">world a grave disservice the biggest</text>
  <text start="563.16" dur="4.799">threat right now is irrational fear of</text>
  <text start="565.2" dur="7.889">bubbles among central bank&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="567.959" dur="9.031">basically what&amp;#39;s happening is this the</text>
  <text start="573.089" dur="5.761">Fed realizes that their bank their</text>
  <text start="576.99" dur="3.78">balance sheet is growing it&amp;#39;s like three</text>
  <text start="578.85" dur="3.179">trillion right now and by the time</text>
  <text start="580.77" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re done it&amp;#39;s going to be around</text>
  <text start="582.029" dur="7.471">five or six trillion and they are also</text>
  <text start="586.26" dur="5.24">creating the stock market Treasury bond</text>
  <text start="589.5" dur="6.149">and real estate bubbles at the same time</text>
  <text start="591.5" dur="6.91">so to stop that they want to ease back</text>
  <text start="595.649" dur="5.851">on the quantitative easing but they</text>
  <text start="598.41" dur="5.1">can&amp;#39;t because as they ease back this is</text>
  <text start="601.5" dur="4.89">the whole mechanism that&amp;#39;s propping up</text>
  <text start="603.51" dur="6.24">the markets so if they ease back the</text>
  <text start="606.39" dur="6.21">markets are going to tumble so which one</text>
  <text start="609.75" dur="5.7">do they do do they ease back and have</text>
  <text start="612.6" dur="6.239">the market stumble or do they keep</text>
  <text start="615.45" dur="6.15">printing and eventually have the market</text>
  <text start="618.839" dur="5.25">stumble so basically no matter what they</text>
  <text start="621.6" dur="5.85">choose we&amp;#39;re ending up in the same spot</text>
  <text start="624.089" dur="5.821">because back in the great I this is what</text>
  <text start="627.45" dur="4.52">Ben Bernanke wanted to do the opposite</text>
  <text start="629.91" dur="5.369">of what happened in the Great Depression</text>
  <text start="631.97" dur="6.01">he the in the Great Depression they they</text>
  <text start="635.279" dur="5.241">contracted the money supply and that</text>
  <text start="637.98" dur="5.28">made the markets tumble and fall and</text>
  <text start="640.52" dur="5.23">completely you know go into this Great</text>
  <text start="643.26" dur="4.949">Depression so he decided to print money</text>
  <text start="645.75" dur="5.19">but what&amp;#39;s happening now is he can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="648.209" dur="4.561">stop it&amp;#39;s like a drug drug addict on</text>
  <text start="650.94" dur="3.3">drugs once you get started you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="652.77" dur="4.71">stop and if you try to stop cold turkey</text>
  <text start="654.24" dur="8.219">what happens if you try to stop you know</text>
  <text start="657.48" dur="6.63">slowly it&amp;#39;s very difficult and once</text>
  <text start="662.459" dur="4.801">you&amp;#39;re past a certain point you just</text>
  <text start="664.11" dur="5.669">can&amp;#39;t stop and he&amp;#39;s past a certain point</text>
  <text start="667.26" dur="4.199">already that he doesn&amp;#39;t know what to do</text>
  <text start="669.779" dur="3.571">because if he can&amp;#39;t read</text>
  <text start="671.459" dur="3.62">the money supply we&amp;#39;re going to have the</text>
  <text start="673.35" dur="4.62">same result as the Great Depression and</text>
  <text start="675.079" dur="6.04">he knows it and if he keeps printing</text>
  <text start="677.97" dur="5.309">he&amp;#39;s going to destroy the dollar and he</text>
  <text start="681.119" dur="4.02">knows that inflation just like in</text>
  <text start="683.279" dur="4.65">another article that we had it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="685.139" dur="7.62">go is going to come rushing back here to</text>
  <text start="687.929" dur="8.1">America and it&amp;#39;s going to destroy the</text>
  <text start="692.759" dur="5.7">dollar so he is in a no-win situation</text>
  <text start="696.029" dur="5.67">and the outcome is exactly the same</text>
  <text start="698.459" dur="6.63">economic collapse there&amp;#39;s Noah there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="701.699" dur="5.521">no way out of this now this was an</text>
  <text start="705.089" dur="7.41">interesting article where there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="707.22" dur="9.539">bear market in gold and you know it goes</text>
  <text start="712.499" dur="5.7">on to say that as the release of the 13f</text>

  <text start="1159.15" dur="5.52">like I said before as soon as you see</text>
  <text start="1161.31" dur="5.01">more tax and urgency to do things that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1164.67" dur="4.25">how you know we&amp;#39;re getting closer and</text>
  <text start="1166.32" dur="5.37">closer to something happening and</text>
  <text start="1168.92" dur="5.41">because of all this is you know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1171.69" dur="5.76">going on especially with this Obama gate</text>
  <text start="1174.33" dur="5.94">stuff pretty soon they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="1177.45" dur="5.43">a distraction and some type of event to</text>
  <text start="1180.27" dur="7.95">get us into war and take our eye off of</text>
  <text start="1182.88" dur="9.36">what is going on and to my point of</text>
  <text start="1188.22" dur="8.07">taxing and to my point of doing things</text>
  <text start="1192.24" dur="6.75">urgently there&amp;#39;s an ammo text coming out</text>
  <text start="1196.29" dur="6.33">and the California Assembly revenue and</text>
  <text start="1198.99" dur="6.19">Taxation approved a measure called a be</text>
  <text start="1202.62" dur="6.52">187 which puts a ten percent</text>
  <text start="1205.18" dur="9.63">tax on all ammunition sold in the state</text>
  <text start="1209.14" dur="11.04">and also basically what they want to do</text>
  <text start="1214.81" dur="8.55">is effective immediately in California</text>
  <text start="1220.18" dur="8.82">on all semi-automatic pistols is to have</text>
  <text start="1223.36" dur="13.35">a micro stamp on all bullets so</text>
  <text start="1229" dur="9.63">basically why are they doing this they</text>
  <text start="1236.71" dur="4.29">are doing this because they know what is</text>
  <text start="1238.63" dur="4.35">happening and especially in those places</text>
  <text start="1241" dur="6.54">just like New York Connecticut Maryland</text>
  <text start="1242.98" dur="8.01">Delaware Chicago California all the</text>
  <text start="1247.54" dur="5.91">states that have major populations that</text>
  <text start="1250.99" dur="5.88">are close to defaulting on their debt</text>
  <text start="1253.45" dur="5.43">are getting rid of the guns are putting</text>
  <text start="1256.87" dur="4.71">laws and to tell on your neighbor are</text>
  <text start="1258.88" dur="5.61">giving rewards for people who you think</text>
  <text start="1261.58" dur="6.71">have an illegal gun are taxing</text>
  <text start="1264.49" dur="6.57">ammunition putting my core stamps</text>
  <text start="1268.29" dur="8.47">limiting the number of rounds in your</text>
  <text start="1271.06" dur="7.44">magazine and to my point the reason why</text>
  <text start="1276.76" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re limiting the magazines and I</text>
  <text start="1278.5" dur="4.23">said this before but on the site again</text>
  <text start="1279.97" dur="6.06">and people like well let me check the</text>
  <text start="1282.73" dur="6.09">shooting and you know is think about if</text>
  <text start="1286.03" dur="5.13">we did have an armed confrontation and</text>
  <text start="1288.82" dur="4.53">you have an ar-15 and you have 30 rounds</text>
  <text start="1291.16" dur="6.9">in the magazine and you&amp;#39;re only allowed</text>
  <text start="1293.35" dur="7.62">to have 10 or 9 well two magazines I</text>
  <text start="1298.06" dur="6.3">have 60 rounds if I have ten rounds I</text>
  <text start="1300.97" dur="6.9">need six of those think about carrying</text>
  <text start="1304.36" dur="7.23">those around it&amp;#39;s a lot more difficult</text>
  <text start="1307.87" dur="7.26">to do so limiting and having you reload</text>
  <text start="1311.59" dur="5.82">and weighing you down during this time</text>
  <text start="1315.13" dur="4.71">is going to be very difficult and they</text>
  <text start="1317.41" dur="5.52">know it because there&amp;#39;s proof and</text>
  <text start="1319.84" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s facts that the case they were</text>
  <text start="1322.93" dur="2.85">trying to make you know if there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1324.01" dur="4.59">shooter in the school if there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1325.78" dur="5.01">shooter you know you can get you can</text>
  <text start="1328.6" dur="4.17">tackle the person if they have to switch</text>
  <text start="1330.79" dur="4.95">clips and that has been proven wrong</text>
  <text start="1332.77" dur="5.49">over and over and I have video on the</text>
  <text start="1335.74" dur="3.69">archive section of sent alerts and you</text>
  <text start="1338.26" dur="5.04">can see this a share</text>
  <text start="1339.43" dur="6.39">did this so basically it&amp;#39;s to weigh us</text>
  <text start="1343.3" dur="7.71">down and to make it much more difficult</text>
  <text start="1345.82" dur="8.22">to carry the number of magazines on each</text>
  <text start="1351.01" dur="5.13">person that is the real reason you see</text>
  <text start="1354.04" dur="4.32">what they&amp;#39;re doing especially they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1356.14" dur="4.59">buying up all the rat the ammunition so</text>
  <text start="1358.36" dur="4.47">you can&amp;#39;t even get it secondly they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1360.73" dur="5.46">making it much difficult much more</text>
  <text start="1362.83" dur="5.64">difficult for you to carry and now with</text>
  <text start="1366.19" dur="5.37">California taxing it for those people</text>
  <text start="1368.47" dur="4.86">who now you know who are strapped with</text>
  <text start="1371.56" dur="6.03">funds and things like that it&amp;#39;s much</text>
  <text start="1373.33" dur="11.4">more difficult in buying the ammo okay</text>
  <text start="1377.59" dur="9">let&amp;#39;s move on here cyber attacks so</text>
  <text start="1384.73" dur="4.47">basically Chinese hackers we zoom</text>
  <text start="1386.59" dur="4.8">attacks on US targets basically again I</text>
  <text start="1389.2" dur="3.81">said this before they don&amp;#39;t know where</text>
  <text start="1391.39" dur="3.81">these attacks are coming from all they</text>
  <text start="1393.01" dur="4.62">see is the attacks coming from the last</text>
  <text start="1395.2" dur="4.35">server when you set up proxy servers you</text>
  <text start="1397.63" dur="4.14">can bounce these things off of many many</text>
  <text start="1399.55" dur="6.18">many many servers and all you see is the</text>
  <text start="1401.77" dur="6.12">last server it&amp;#39;s coming from but there</text>
  <text start="1405.73" dur="3.72">was another interesting article where us</text>

  <text start="1789.23" dur="4.59">fought it they knew exactly what the</text>
  <text start="1792.02" dur="4.409">government the end game of the</text>

  <text start="1830.39" dur="9.72">have basically no bearing on what</text>
  <text start="1838.52" dur="4.67">they&amp;#39;re saying they can do with these</text>
  <text start="1840.11" dur="7.62">laws because the Second Amendment and</text>
