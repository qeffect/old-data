  <text start="193.23" dur="6.21">to strike strike America now I was</text>
  <text start="196.32" dur="5.55">thinking to myself why would anyone do</text>
  <text start="199.44" dur="4.5">especially military commander why would</text>
  <text start="201.87" dur="4.17">they have a picture then publish it and</text>
  <text start="203.94" dur="5.88">show that here this is what we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="206.04" dur="6.84">to do I mean is this propaganda or what</text>
  <text start="209.82" dur="5.76">I mean why would you do that any type of</text>
  <text start="212.88" dur="6.12">military wouldn&amp;#39;t you keep everything a</text>
  <text start="215.58" dur="4.29">secret why would you go ahead and say</text>

  <text start="222.57" dur="4.919">whole entire military plant now this is</text>
  <text start="225.269" dur="4.041">propaganda they&amp;#39;re trying to show you</text>
  <text start="227.489" dur="4.5">like this is what we&amp;#39;re going to do if</text>
  <text start="229.31" dur="4.54">you keep provoking us and I think</text>
  <text start="231.989" dur="3.451">they&amp;#39;re playing the same game the</text>
  <text start="233.85" dur="3.3">central bankers are because they&amp;#39;re can</text>
  <text start="235.44" dur="4.17">the central bankers and the US</text>
  <text start="237.15" dur="5.07">government are continuously provoking</text>
  <text start="239.61" dur="5.939">North Korea and the way I see it now I</text>
  <text start="242.22" dur="6.59">think they feel and they this might</text>
  <text start="245.549" dur="6.69">happen that they can provoke North Korea</text>
  <text start="248.81" dur="6.67">into making the first strike and this is</text>
  <text start="252.239" dur="5.37">what they want them to do and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="255.48" dur="3.78">sure sure that North Korea is really</text>
  <text start="257.609" dur="3.301">going to do it i think the save face I</text>
  <text start="259.26" dur="5.73">think they&amp;#39;re shooting out the same</text>
  <text start="260.91" dur="7.47">propaganda that word that the United</text>
  <text start="264.99" dur="5.04">States is doing but we definitely not we</text>
  <text start="268.38" dur="4.74">the essential Baker&amp;#39;s on the government</text>
  <text start="270.03" dur="4.52">they definitely want North Korea to make</text>
  <text start="273.12" dur="6.44">the first move</text>
  <text start="274.55" dur="7.11">we can start this war going and I think</text>
  <text start="279.56" dur="4.53">they tried it with Syria I think they</text>
  <text start="281.66" dur="4.89">tried it with Iran I think they tried it</text>
  <text start="284.09" dur="4.86">with China and I think they moved on to</text>
  <text start="286.55" dur="4.38">North Korea thinking that you know what</text>
  <text start="288.95" dur="4.92">I think we can get them to make the</text>
  <text start="290.93" dur="7.2">first move and if they do the war is on</text>
  <text start="293.87" dur="6.47">and this is why you see so much on North</text>
  <text start="298.13" dur="7.17">Korea right now I mean it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="300.34" dur="8.08">tremendous amount all of a sudden but</text>
  <text start="305.3" dur="4.92">let&amp;#39;s move on i mean this is all part of</text>
  <text start="308.42" dur="3.96">the economic collapse this is what they</text>
  <text start="310.22" dur="5.52">need to happen this is the cover apart</text>
  <text start="312.38" dur="4.92">and they need to get this going now i</text>
  <text start="315.74" dur="3.92">don&amp;#39;t know if everyone knows who jim</text>
  <text start="317.3" dur="5.94">rogers is but he&amp;#39;s a very famous</text>
  <text start="319.66" dur="5.89">investment person and he&amp;#39;s telling</text>
  <text start="323.24" dur="4.98">everyone to run for the hills he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.55" dur="5.13">separating his money into accounts that</text>
  <text start="328.22" dur="5.55">are insured bring it down to a level</text>
  <text start="330.68" dur="5.49">that that his money is insured but you</text>
  <text start="333.77" dur="7.2">know what I I don&amp;#39;t even trust the</text>
  <text start="336.17" dur="7.32">insured amounts I would just I don&amp;#39;t I</text>

  <text start="343.49" dur="5.82">don&amp;#39;t even think the insurance part</text>
  <text start="345.5" dur="9.36">because the FDIC there is no way that</text>
  <text start="349.31" dur="7.59">they can handle covering all of this</text>
  <text start="354.86" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s impossible especially with the</text>
  <text start="356.9" dur="3.36">amount and I&amp;#39;ve done this in the</text>
  <text start="358.25" dur="4.11">previous episode so I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="360.26" dur="7.59">continually go over it but there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="362.36" dur="7.77">way that they can cover every single</text>
  <text start="367.85" dur="4.65">bank they just do not have enough money</text>
  <text start="370.13" dur="4.47">in the insurance and it wasn&amp;#39;t set up to</text>
  <text start="372.5" dur="7.02">do that it was set up for one or two or</text>
  <text start="374.6" dur="7.38">three off bank but not all banks but let</text>

  <text start="394.67" dur="5.67">drone kick that you know she&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="397.97" dur="6.12">that these drones make perfect</text>
  <text start="400.34" dur="7.44">assassination weapons and you know we</text>
  <text start="404.09" dur="4.439">have to have you no laws put in place</text>
  <text start="407.78" dur="6.509">for these draw</text>
  <text start="408.529" dur="8.67">owns now I don&amp;#39;t know why everyone</text>
  <text start="414.289" dur="5.94">considers these drones so different</text>
  <text start="417.199" dur="5.88">right now than someone flying a</text>
  <text start="420.229" dur="6.69">helicopter with a pilot inside and</text>
  <text start="423.079" dur="7.61">spying on you to me what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="426.919" dur="6.66">difference it&amp;#39;s almost like email and</text>
  <text start="430.689" dur="6.58">regular mail what&amp;#39;s the difference you</text>
  <text start="433.579" dur="6.57">don&amp;#39;t use paper and speed but otherwise</text>
  <text start="437.269" dur="6.9">it&amp;#39;s the same written word here you have</text>
  <text start="440.149" dur="5.97">a drone and there&amp;#39;s a person still</text>
  <text start="444.169" dur="4.74">controlling it yes they&amp;#39;re not in the</text>
  <text start="446.119" dur="5.39">drone but they&amp;#39;re controlling it let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="448.909" dur="6.54">take the helicopter put it side-by-side</text>
  <text start="451.509" dur="7.48">what is the difference helicopters a</text>
  <text start="455.449" dur="7.53">little bit bigger I mean you can mount a</text>
  <text start="458.989" dur="5.85">camera it&amp;#39;s basically I you can you know</text>
  <text start="462.979" dur="3.81">send the helicopter up into the sky with</text>
  <text start="464.839" dur="4.38">a camera have it stay up there take</text>
  <text start="466.789" dur="6.48">pictures I don&amp;#39;t understand why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="469.219" dur="8.641">having such a problem with this but from</text>
  <text start="473.269" dur="7.56">this drone controversy we go into what</text>
  <text start="477.86" dur="4.949">kind of scares me is and I put the video</text>
  <text start="480.829" dur="5.19">on this posting if you haven&amp;#39;t seen it</text>
  <text start="482.809" dur="6.57">already is that someone has developed a</text>
  <text start="486.019" dur="6.57">way to have drones communicate with each</text>
  <text start="489.379" dur="6.5">other and work with each other and in</text>
  <text start="492.589" dur="8.58">this video it&amp;#39;s showing these drones all</text>
  <text start="495.879" dur="7.45">holding a net and flinging catching a</text>
  <text start="501.169" dur="5.73">ball in the net and flinging it up and</text>
  <text start="503.329" dur="6.38">down up and down now if they take this a</text>
  <text start="506.899" dur="7.11">step further we&amp;#39;re looking at like a</text>
  <text start="509.709" dur="7.06">terminator type of scenario this is what</text>
  <text start="514.009" dur="6.15">I mean really think about it back in</text>
  <text start="516.769" dur="7.82">that movie those were drones computer</text>
  <text start="520.159" dur="9.18">operated devices flying in the air</text>
  <text start="524.589" dur="7.451">spying on people shooting people we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="529.339" dur="4.701">getting to that area I know it sounds</text>
  <text start="532.04" dur="6.599">like science fiction but it&amp;#39;s here today</text>
  <text start="534.04" dur="7.089">we&amp;#39;re using them today and these are the</text>
  <text start="538.639" dur="3.781">perfect assassination weapons and we</text>
  <text start="541.129" dur="4.341">should all be sitting here going</text>

  <text start="552.079" dur="5.491">never said that they wouldn&amp;#39;t use the</text>
  <text start="554.839" dur="5.55">drones on Americans that were in combat</text>
  <text start="557.57" dur="5.1">on American soil they only said that</text>
  <text start="560.389" dur="6.271">they would not use the drones on</text>
  <text start="562.67" dur="7.94">Americans that were not in combat so to</text>
  <text start="566.66" dur="7.26">me I mean let&amp;#39;s use common sense here</text>
  <text start="570.61" dur="5.83">what do you think they would use if some</text>
  <text start="573.92" dur="6.3">type of revolution or some type of armed</text>
