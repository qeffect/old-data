  <text start="76.14" dur="3.66">situation in Greece well it is not</text>
  <text start="78.3" dur="4.08">improving whatsoever</text>
  <text start="79.8" dur="5.37">right now we have garbage collectors</text>
  <text start="82.38" dur="6.06">which are striking in Greece and we need</text>
  <text start="85.17" dur="6.449">to remember the central banks the ECB</text>
  <text start="88.44" dur="7.289">the IMF and the creditors they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="91.619" dur="5.461">pushing austerity on the people where</text>
  <text start="95.729" dur="4.14">the government&amp;#39;s going to be laying off</text>
  <text start="97.08" dur="5.24">people cutting pensions and whatnot and</text>
  <text start="99.869" dur="4.981">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that the</text>
  <text start="102.32" dur="6.04">government workers the garbage</text>
  <text start="104.85" dur="8.01">collectors they are striking right now</text>
  <text start="108.36" dur="7.679">because of their job contracts and what</text>
  <text start="112.86" dur="5.819">they want is they want a new draft</text>
  <text start="116.039" dur="5.041">legislation to Parliament within the day</text>
  <text start="118.679" dur="5.041">to renew job contracts for thousands of</text>
  <text start="121.08" dur="3.599">municipal garbage workers and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="123.72" dur="4.11">saying they&amp;#39;re not going to be picking</text>
  <text start="124.679" dur="6.03">up the garbage if this isn&amp;#39;t done now we</text>
  <text start="127.83" dur="6.18">can see right now that after 10 days of</text>
  <text start="130.709" dur="6.181">protests there&amp;#39;s huge piles of trash</text>
  <text start="134.01" dur="5.79">around Athens and what is happening</text>
  <text start="136.89" dur="5.34">right now is that we can see austerity</text>
  <text start="139.8" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s taking its toll now the problem</text>
  <text start="142.23" dur="5.82">with all of this is that these long-term</text>
  <text start="145.2" dur="6.75">contracts that these workers want well</text>
  <text start="148.05" dur="5.88">this might be in breach of the strict</text>
  <text start="151.95" dur="3.84">budget obligation set out under the</text>
  <text start="153.93" dur="5.19">Greece&amp;#39;s international bailout</text>
  <text start="155.79" dur="5.88">agreements and again the central bankers</text>
  <text start="159.12" dur="4.17">they always push the pain on to the</text>
  <text start="161.67" dur="4.349">people and we can see it&amp;#39;s taking its</text>
  <text start="163.29" dur="4.589">toll in Greece so actually things are</text>
  <text start="166.019" dur="4.231">not improving in Greece things are</text>
  <text start="167.879" dur="3.991">actually deteriorating very very quickly</text>
  <text start="170.25" dur="3.72">and we can see as more and more</text>
  <text start="171.87" dur="5.16">austerity is pushed on to the people and</text>
  <text start="173.97" dur="5.159">more assets that are sold off within the</text>
  <text start="177.03" dur="3.48">country and as the creditors the central</text>
  <text start="179.129" dur="4.681">veins become wealthier and wealthier and</text>
  <text start="180.51" dur="5.91">wealthier we can see that within Greece</text>
  <text start="183.81" dur="3.75">the population within Greece the</text>
  <text start="186.42" dur="3.27">situation just gets</text>
  <text start="187.56" dur="4.14">worse now something very interesting</text>
  <text start="189.69" dur="4.86">happened today now we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="191.7" dur="5.55">before this is nothing new one minute</text>
  <text start="194.55" dur="5.13">after 4:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time as</text>
  <text start="197.25" dur="8.069">the European market was warming up for</text>
  <text start="199.68" dur="10.32">trading gold suddenly plunged to $18 or</text>
  <text start="205.319" dur="7.381">as much as 1.6 percent - 1236 and ounce</text>
  <text start="210" dur="6.09">before bouncing on a massive surge in</text>
  <text start="212.7" dur="6.72">volume with over 18,000 contracts are</text>
  <text start="216.09" dur="7.38">just over two billion notional trading</text>
  <text start="219.42" dur="7.71">in s in second so a total of eighteen</text>
  <text start="223.47" dur="6.06">thousand 149 Lots were traded on the</text>
  <text start="227.13" dur="8.91">comics in just a minute before falling</text>
  <text start="229.53" dur="8.85">back to 2334 lots an hour later hmm how</text>
  <text start="236.04" dur="4.59">do you think this happened you think</text>
  <text start="238.38" dur="4.859">it&amp;#39;s just out of nowhere it just all of</text>
  <text start="240.63" dur="4.469">a sudden at 4:00 a.m. all of a sudden it</text>
  <text start="243.239" dur="3.601">was a fat-finger error well this is what</text>
  <text start="245.099" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re really blaming it on and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="246.84" dur="5.28">all saying we don&amp;#39;t have a clue how this</text>
  <text start="248.519" dur="6.481">happened yes we do we know down in the</text>
  <text start="252.12" dur="4.919">basement of the Fed we know everything</text>
  <text start="255" dur="3.239">is computerized and we know that someone</text>
  <text start="257.039" dur="3.54">clicked the mouse and said you know</text>
  <text start="258.239" dur="5.011">something let&amp;#39;s bring down the gold and</text>
  <text start="260.579" dur="4.741">silver price once again and this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="263.25" dur="4.229">the first time we&amp;#39;ve seen this and we</text>
  <text start="265.32" dur="5.61">know this is what manipulation looks</text>
  <text start="267.479" dur="6.451">like they bring down the gold and silver</text>
  <text start="270.93" dur="5.31">by dumping thousands upon thousands of</text>
  <text start="273.93" dur="4.14">contracts to get people out of the</text>
  <text start="276.24" dur="4.2">market and they gobble up as much as</text>
  <text start="278.07" dur="4.819">they possibly can and they&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="280.44" dur="5.729">because they know the dollar is</text>
  <text start="282.889" dur="4.991">continually falling they know the value</text>
  <text start="286.169" dur="4.231">of the dollar is continually falling and</text>
  <text start="287.88" dur="4.289">they don&amp;#39;t want gold or silver to go up</text>
  <text start="290.4" dur="4.86">because that would be a signal that</text>
  <text start="292.169" dur="4.741">something is wrong in the market now we</text>
  <text start="295.26" dur="4.71">can see there&amp;#39;s a lot of different</text>
  <text start="296.91" dur="4.77">economic indicators that are telling us</text>
  <text start="299.97" dur="4.38">that there&amp;#39;s something wrong now</text>
  <text start="301.68" dur="6.69">especially in the automobile industry we</text>
  <text start="304.35" dur="8.31">are seeing a perfect storm form now back</text>
  <text start="308.37" dur="6.81">in 2009 the automotive industry faced a</text>
  <text start="312.66" dur="4.53">great challenge new light vehicle sales</text>
  <text start="315.18" dur="3.6">dropped to ten point four million GM</text>
  <text start="317.19" dur="4.65">Chrysler went through bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="318.78" dur="5.25">reorganization Riccio retail</text>
  <text start="321.84" dur="4.26">dealers they closed and many folks lost</text>
  <text start="324.03" dur="4.71">their jobs the US government</text>
  <text start="326.1" dur="5.55">well they felt the need to act in order</text>
  <text start="328.74" dur="4.8">to support the automotive industry and</text>
  <text start="331.65" dur="4.26">we know that the government went in and</text>
  <text start="333.54" dur="4.5">they purchased stocks in these</text>
  <text start="335.91" dur="5.55">automobile industries they bailed them</text>
  <text start="338.04" dur="5.97">out and we see right now that the Fed</text>
  <text start="341.46" dur="4.41">also stepped in at that point in time to</text>
  <text start="344.01" dur="6.75">help stimulate the overall economy by</text>
  <text start="345.87" dur="7.53">reducing interest rates well right now</text>
  <text start="350.76" dur="5.04">we can see everything has completely</text>
  <text start="353.4" dur="5.79">changed yes this allowed the automobile</text>
  <text start="355.8" dur="6.81">industry to boost its sales by creating</text>
  <text start="359.19" dur="6.33">more cars by giving loans and leases to</text>
  <text start="362.61" dur="6.69">subprime individuals by channel stuffing</text>
  <text start="365.52" dur="6.42">Lots but everything has changed now the</text>
  <text start="369.3" dur="4.92">set of ingredients that perfectly fuel</text>
  <text start="371.94" dur="6.63">the recovery well they&amp;#39;ve all been</text>
  <text start="374.22" dur="6.259">reversed and now they power the perfect</text>
  <text start="378.57" dur="4.95">storm think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="380.479" dur="6.371">interest rates are rising before</text>
  <text start="383.52" dur="5.91">interest rates were falling now they are</text>
  <text start="386.85" dur="5.879">rising and it&amp;#39;s getting more and more</text>
  <text start="389.43" dur="7.59">difficult for manufacturers to give</text>
  <text start="392.729" dur="5.731">incentives used vehicle prices are now</text>
  <text start="397.02" dur="4.2">falling and will continue to fall</text>
  <text start="398.46" dur="5.91">falling used vehicle values prolong the</text>
  <text start="401.22" dur="6.629">negative equity period limiting the</text>
  <text start="404.37" dur="7.59">buying power of the consumer slowing the</text>
  <text start="407.849" dur="6.831">velocity of new vehicle sales the last</text>
  <text start="411.96" dur="6.959">well it&amp;#39;s the most dangerous of all</text>
  <text start="414.68" dur="8.109">residual valuables values on leases with</text>
  <text start="418.919" dur="7.111">lag use vehicle values are adjusting and</text>
  <text start="422.789" dur="5.821">will continue to adjust lower what will</text>
  <text start="426.03" dur="4.47">happen when the new vehicle prices that</text>
  <text start="428.61" dur="4.8">have inflated beyond the affordability</text>
  <text start="430.5" dur="5.25">of 0% loans are no longer supported with</text>
  <text start="433.41" dur="4.939">the buying power that leasing provides</text>
  <text start="435.75" dur="5.669">what will happen to the sales volume of</text>
  <text start="438.349" dur="5.79">the manufacturers that rely on leases</text>
  <text start="441.419" dur="5.601">for more than 50% of their total sales</text>
  <text start="444.139" dur="6.701">well this is what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="447.02" dur="6.79">inventory at dealers will begin to back</text>
  <text start="450.84" dur="4.799">up we will start witnessing big</text>
  <text start="453.81" dur="3.78">discounts from manufacturers</text>
  <text start="455.639" dur="5.161">that keep rising in an effort to control</text>
  <text start="457.59" dur="6.349">a rising day supply problem because new</text>
  <text start="460.8" dur="5.79">vehicles will no longer be affordable</text>
  <text start="463.939" dur="4.121">incentives will stop working because as</text>
  <text start="466.59" dur="3.659">the price of the new vehicle is reduced</text>
  <text start="468.06" dur="4.71">it will simultaneously put downward</text>
  <text start="470.249" dur="4.831">pressure on the trade value of the one</text>
  <text start="472.77" dur="5.28">to three year old old version of the</text>
  <text start="475.08" dur="5.91">vehicle production might slow or stop</text>
  <text start="478.05" dur="5.519">for a period of time and this is going</text>
  <text start="480.99" dur="5.19">to set up the perfect storm everything</text>
  <text start="483.569" dur="6.21">all the ingredients that were used to</text>
  <text start="486.18" dur="7.169">create this automobile bubble have gone</text>
  <text start="489.779" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re disappearing and we can see at</text>
  <text start="493.349" dur="6.301">this point that they&amp;#39;re setting up the</text>
  <text start="495.569" dur="5.551">perfect storm and basically we will see</text>
  <text start="499.65" dur="4.68">the ornament we&amp;#39;re already starting to</text>
  <text start="501.12" dur="6.389">see it it&amp;#39;s going to crash very very</text>
  <text start="504.33" dur="6.209">hard worse than 2008 now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="507.509" dur="5.551">seeing retail while those sales have</text>
  <text start="510.539" dur="6.06">been declining we see the big ticket</text>
  <text start="513.06" dur="6.06">items like washers dryers fridges well</text>
  <text start="516.599" dur="4.891">they are also declining and this is why</text>
  <text start="519.12" dur="6.029">we see durable goods they have</text>
  <text start="521.49" dur="6.029">completely tumbled and right now Mays</text>
  <text start="525.149" dur="5.401">preliminary durable good orders tumble</text>
  <text start="527.519" dur="5.911">by 1.1 percent month a month and across</text>
  <text start="530.55" dur="4.649">the entire report numbers disappointed</text>
  <text start="533.43" dur="5.07">with Capitol good orders and shipments</text>
  <text start="535.199" dur="7.311">both dropping considerably durable goods</text>
  <text start="538.5" dur="7.98">orders remain five percent below the</text>
  <text start="542.51" dur="7.889">2007 peak while the S&amp;amp;P is 55 percent</text>
  <text start="546.48" dur="6.84">above its 2007 peak can anyone say</text>
  <text start="550.399" dur="6.581">manipulation anywhere because this</text>
  <text start="553.32" dur="6">really makes no sense whatsoever and we</text>
  <text start="556.98" dur="4.469">can see that through all these different</text>
  <text start="559.32" dur="3.99">economic indicators that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="561.449" dur="4.08">looking at we can see that the economy</text>
  <text start="563.31" dur="5.01">is continually deteriorating it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="565.529" dur="4.591">improving it&amp;#39;s not getting better and we</text>
  <text start="568.32" dur="3.15">know that the bids came out with a</text>
  <text start="570.12" dur="2.61">report and that&amp;#39;s the Bank of</text>
  <text start="571.47" dur="3.63">International Settlements</text>
  <text start="572.73" dur="4.38">this is like the bank of all central</text>
  <text start="575.1" dur="4.29">banks and they came out with their</text>
  <text start="577.11" dur="3.51">annual report and it was released over</text>
  <text start="579.39" dur="4.08">the weekend we mentioned this like a day</text>
  <text start="580.62" dur="7.05">or two ago and what they&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="583.47" dur="5.64">that the entire market right now might</text>
  <text start="587.67" dur="6.599">be heading</text>
  <text start="589.11" dur="7.74">to this new renewed economic downturn in</text>
  <text start="594.269" dur="4.32">other words the biz report says the Fed</text>
  <text start="596.85" dur="4.2">in particular will continue to normalize</text>
  <text start="598.589" dur="6.331">policy in part because it wants to amass</text>
  <text start="601.05" dur="6.84">rate hikes which can be used to fight</text>
  <text start="604.92" dur="5.07">the next recession the question is are</text>
  <text start="607.89" dur="3.75">they fighting the recession or are they</text>
  <text start="609.99" dur="3.2">going to be causing the recession well</text>
  <text start="611.64" dur="5.18">every time and we discussed this before</text>
  <text start="613.19" dur="6.55">every time the Fed tightens we saw an</text>
  <text start="616.82" dur="4.81">economic downturn now think about what</text>
  <text start="619.74" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re doing at this point they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="621.63" dur="4.769">raising rates and all of a sudden they</text>
  <text start="623.13" dur="5.1">said ok let&amp;#39;s look at to see what is</text>
  <text start="626.399" dur="4.201">happening out in the market let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="628.23" dur="4.41">the policy changes coming from Trump</text>
  <text start="630.6" dur="5.52">before we do anything else this is what</text>
  <text start="632.64" dur="5.25">fed Ballard is saying right now now</text>
  <text start="636.12" dur="3.029">they&amp;#39;re also unwinding their balance</text>
  <text start="637.89" dur="2.91">sheet now they took on trillions and</text>
  <text start="639.149" dur="3.961">trillions of dollars worth of toxic real</text>
  <text start="640.8" dur="5.159">estate the bubble is at its height so</text>
  <text start="643.11" dur="4.38">they bought this toxic real estate with</text>
  <text start="645.959" dur="5.37">you know pennies on the dollar</text>
  <text start="647.49" dur="5.94">now it has inflated where they can sell</text>
  <text start="651.329" dur="5.281">it off and make a profit now think about</text>
  <text start="653.43" dur="6.81">this they&amp;#39;re selling it off during the</text>
  <text start="656.61" dur="6.539">height of the bubble they know that this</text>
  <text start="660.24" dur="5.07">bubble was created by them they know</text>
  <text start="663.149" dur="5.671">that real estate it&amp;#39;s going to plummet</text>
  <text start="665.31" dur="6.779">not like it was back in 2008 it were</text>
  <text start="668.82" dur="4.889">probably even worse than that point in</text>
  <text start="672.089" dur="3.93">time and real estate is going to stay</text>
  <text start="673.709" dur="4.951">down for a very long time so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="676.019" dur="5.401">selling it off when its high trying to</text>
  <text start="678.66" dur="5.64">clear out their balance sheet so they</text>
  <text start="681.42" dur="4.74">can buy more real estate because you</text>
  <text start="684.3" dur="3.42">know there&amp;#39;s going to be more and more</text>
  <text start="686.16" dur="3.63">people that are going to lose their</text>

  <text start="783.37" dur="4.8">have to blame this on another group</text>
  <text start="785.68" dur="5.19">another country and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>

  <text start="805.63" dur="6.06">China they&amp;#39;re showing signs that their</text>
  <text start="809.14" dur="4.71">economies are overheating and what</text>
  <text start="811.69" dur="5.339">they&amp;#39;re reporting is that a new</text>
  <text start="813.85" dur="6.239">financial crisis is brewing in the</text>
  <text start="817.029" dur="7.951">emerging economies and it could hit with</text>
  <text start="820.089" dur="7.351">a vengeance now we can see already that</text>
  <text start="824.98" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re already telling you what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="827.44" dur="5.22">to happen they&amp;#39;re already saying that</text>
  <text start="830.14" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s going to be coming from China and</text>
  <text start="832.66" dur="5.82">the emerging markets where there is a</text>

  <text start="845.529" dur="4.411">this credit crisis and it looks like it</text>
  <text start="848.02" dur="4.86">is coming from China but they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="849.94" dur="5.009">setting it up so China and these other</text>
  <text start="852.88" dur="4.23">countries can take the blame but we know</text>
  <text start="854.949" dur="6.091">the central banking</text>
  <text start="857.11" dur="7.14">stem created this mess and we know that</text>
  <text start="861.04" dur="5.34">China used this to their advantage now</text>
  <text start="864.25" dur="5.91">remember China took on a lot of gold</text>
  <text start="866.38" dur="6.24">they have gold to back up their system</text>
  <text start="870.16" dur="4.35">they can rely on gold Russia has gold</text>
  <text start="872.62" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;ve been amassing gold quite a bit</text>
  <text start="874.51" dur="6.66">for over a long period of time and the</text>
  <text start="877.63" dur="6.6">Biz said that their credit to GDP gap</text>
  <text start="881.17" dur="5.4">indicator indicator also showed debt</text>
  <text start="884.23" dur="5.7">which is seen as an early warning</text>
  <text start="886.57" dur="6.03">indicator for a country&amp;#39;s banking system</text>
  <text start="889.93" dur="4.77">is rising far faster than the growth in</text>
  <text start="892.6" dur="4.919">other Asian economies such as Thailand</text>
  <text start="894.7" dur="5.55">and Hong Kong they also pointed out that</text>
  <text start="897.519" dur="4.411">the brexit will make Britain worse off</text>
  <text start="900.25" dur="4.11">now they&amp;#39;ve been saying that for a very</text>
  <text start="901.93" dur="6">long time they continually say this and</text>
  <text start="904.36" dur="5.94">what we need to realize is that when the</text>
  <text start="907.93" dur="3.57">central bank or the deep state tell you</text>
  <text start="910.3" dur="4.56">that you&amp;#39;re going to be worse off</text>
  <text start="911.5" dur="5.76">without them that means that a scare</text>
  <text start="914.86" dur="3.539">tactic what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is</text>
  <text start="917.26" dur="3.329">saying listen without the private</text>
  <text start="918.399" dur="4.831">western central bank you cannot survive</text>
  <text start="920.589" dur="4.711">but we can survive actually we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="923.23" dur="4.53">survive better off without them look at</text>
  <text start="925.3" dur="4.62">Iceland where they took total control</text>
  <text start="927.76" dur="4.319">they put bankers in jail their economy</text>
  <text start="929.92" dur="4.349">is flourishing right now when you look</text>
  <text start="932.079" dur="4.141">at countries like France and you look at</text>
  <text start="934.269" dur="3.091">Italy and you look at Spain and you look</text>
  <text start="936.22" dur="3.39">at Greece where the private western</text>
  <text start="937.36" dur="5.339">central bank has their claws in these</text>
  <text start="939.61" dur="5.37">countries they&amp;#39;re worse off they created</text>
  <text start="942.699" dur="4.861">debt around the world which cannot be</text>
  <text start="944.98" dur="6.57">sustained and they told us during the</text>
  <text start="947.56" dur="7.38">brexit referendum they said well if you</text>
  <text start="951.55" dur="5.099">vote to get rid of the central bank well</text>
  <text start="954.94" dur="3.87">the economy is going to fall apart as</text>
  <text start="956.649" dur="6">soon as the vote comes through and guess</text>
  <text start="958.81" dur="6.06">what happened nothing and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="962.649" dur="6.721">seeing right now is that the central</text>
  <text start="964.87" dur="9.27">bank the Fed the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="969.37" dur="7.29">deep state they&amp;#39;re already creating the</text>
  <text start="974.14" dur="5.699">narrative they&amp;#39;re creating the narrative</text>
  <text start="976.66" dur="6.48">to let us know how this is going to go</text>
  <text start="979.839" dur="5.221">down and who they&amp;#39;re going to blame now</text>
  <text start="983.14" dur="3.84">here in the u.s. they&amp;#39;re going to blame</text>
  <text start="985.06" dur="3.389">Trump the rest of the world they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="986.98" dur="3.89">going to point to China in the emerging</text>
  <text start="988.449" dur="3.951">markets and we can see that if this</text>
  <text start="990.87" dur="4.26">all doesn&amp;#39;t work I mean this is going to</text>
  <text start="992.4" dur="4.95">be the first phase of course but if it</text>
  <text start="995.13" dur="5.31">doesn&amp;#39;t work they&amp;#39;ll have another plan</text>
  <text start="997.35" dur="4.47">but this is the first stage we&amp;#39;re most</text>
  <text start="1000.44" dur="3.54">likely the economy is going to come down</text>
  <text start="1001.82" dur="3.93">in two stages the first stage is going</text>
  <text start="1003.98" dur="3.51">to be this and they&amp;#39;re going to say</text>
  <text start="1005.75" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t worry about it the central bank</text>
  <text start="1007.49" dur="3.84">can help out the central bank can repair</text>
  <text start="1009.86" dur="3.36">this and what they&amp;#39;ll do is they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1011.33" dur="3">start stimulus once again now a lot of</text>
  <text start="1013.22" dur="2.52">people are saying yes this is what</text>
  <text start="1014.33" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re going to do and of course this</text>
  <text start="1015.74" dur="3.84">is what they will do and they&amp;#39;ll make it</text>
  <text start="1017.75" dur="4.95">look like they&amp;#39;re fixing the economy</text>
  <text start="1019.58" dur="5.31">which they know they can&amp;#39;t at this point</text>
  <text start="1022.7" dur="4.41">this is where the second part comes in</text>
  <text start="1024.89" dur="4.559">this is where the event the cyber attack</text>
  <text start="1027.11" dur="5.069">whatever they&amp;#39;re going to use to explain</text>
  <text start="1029.449" dur="5.49">away why the economy is failing right</text>
  <text start="1032.179" dur="6.63">now one thing we know right now is that</text>
  <text start="1034.939" dur="6.531">the economy is deteriorating it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1038.809" dur="5.25">to collapse one way or another and</text>
  <text start="1041.47" dur="4.9">different financial pundants are out</text>
  <text start="1044.059" dur="4.681">there that are even that are out on the</text>
  <text start="1046.37" dur="5.25">corporate media they&amp;#39;re even letting you</text>
  <text start="1048.74" dur="4.29">know that we could be entering recession</text>
  <text start="1051.62" dur="3.09">when you start to hear this all over the</text>
  <text start="1053.03" dur="3.27">place and we&amp;#39;ve been talking about this</text>
  <text start="1054.71" dur="4.32">for a long time and we&amp;#39;ve been in a</text>
  <text start="1056.3" dur="6.93">recession first of all as they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="1059.03" dur="6.39">saying it now you know that the time</text>
  <text start="1063.23" dur="4.41">period is getting closer and closer and</text>
  <text start="1065.42" dur="4.8">you know once we&amp;#39;re in that collapsed</text>
  <text start="1067.64" dur="3.84">scenario the government the Fed they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1070.22" dur="3.209">going to come out and tell you when it</text>
  <text start="1071.48" dur="4.32">all started and most likely it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1073.429" dur="6.63">to be when we said it started back in</text>
  <text start="1075.8" dur="6.81">2016 so what we need to do right now is</text>
  <text start="1080.059" dur="3.12">we all need to get prepared for what is</text>
  <text start="1082.61" dur="3.3">coming</text>
  <text start="1083.179" dur="5.611">they&amp;#39;re already letting us know what is</text>
  <text start="1085.91" dur="5.25">going to happen you need your food you</text>
  <text start="1088.79" dur="4.83">need your water you need your gold and</text>
  <text start="1091.16" dur="4.58">silver you need your cash on hand you</text>
  <text start="1093.62" dur="5.07">need a weapon to protect your family and</text>
  <text start="1095.74" dur="5.74">you need medical supplies toiletries and</text>
  <text start="1098.69" dur="5.64">things like that the reason for all this</text>
  <text start="1101.48" dur="5.31">is because once the value of the dollar</text>
  <text start="1104.33" dur="4.41">decreases you&amp;#39;re going to see inflation</text>
  <text start="1106.79" dur="3.6">you&amp;#39;re going to see a lot of worried</text>
  <text start="1108.74" dur="3.09">people running to the supermarkets</text>
  <text start="1110.39" dur="2.73">you&amp;#39;re going to see a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1111.83" dur="3.12">saying I don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1113.12" dur="4.68">happening here I lost my job I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1114.95" dur="5.4">have supplies and yes and the first week</text>
  <text start="1117.8" dur="4.11">or so people will be calm people will be</text>
  <text start="1120.35" dur="3.93">saying okay this will blow over in a</text>
  <text start="1121.91" dur="5.13">week or two but it won&amp;#39;t this</text>
  <text start="1124.28" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;ll continue on it will drag out and</text>
  <text start="1127.04" dur="4.17">people then after the first week the</text>
  <text start="1129.5" dur="3.48">second week the third week people will</text>
  <text start="1131.21" dur="4.53">start getting nervous there&amp;#39;ll be more</text>
  <text start="1132.98" dur="5.46">and more layoffs and of course the Fed</text>
  <text start="1135.74" dur="3.84">the government will be on TV telling you</text>
  <text start="1138.44" dur="2.58">how things are going to be getting</text>
  <text start="1139.58" dur="3">better don&amp;#39;t worry about it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1141.02" dur="4.02">doing everything they possibly can and</text>
  <text start="1142.58" dur="4.98">you know they&amp;#39;re going to be reeling</text>
  <text start="1145.04" dur="4.86">because the whole system will be coming</text>
  <text start="1147.56" dur="5.58">down all at once and the stimulus that</text>
  <text start="1149.9" dur="5.79">the Fed uses is really not going to work</text>
  <text start="1153.14" dur="4.29">and you&amp;#39;re going to see inflation which</text>
  <text start="1155.69" dur="3.36">means the value of the dollar is going</text>
