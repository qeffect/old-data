  <text start="98.44" dur="5.91">of leaks in the White House right now</text>
  <text start="100.57" dur="5.97">and Trump is trying to narrow down who</text>
  <text start="104.35" dur="4.08">these leaks are coming from they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="106.54" dur="4.469">already found out that Katie Walsh was</text>
  <text start="108.43" dur="5.64">one of them McCain was another and right</text>
  <text start="111.009" dur="4.621">now Trump is blaming Obama for the</text>
  <text start="114.07" dur="4.53">protest against him and other</text>
  <text start="115.63" dur="4.89">Republicans as well as some of the leaks</text>
  <text start="118.6" dur="4.83">from the White House he said I think</text>
  <text start="120.52" dur="5.459">President Obama is behind it because his</text>
  <text start="123.43" dur="5.01">people are certainly behind it and we</text>
  <text start="125.979" dur="6.361">can see right now most likely this is</text>
  <text start="128.44" dur="7.579">the case now in regards to natural news</text>
  <text start="132.34" dur="6.27">we know that it&amp;#39;s been six days and</text>
  <text start="136.019" dur="5.111">natural news has been censored they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="138.61" dur="5.46">been removed from google completely 140</text>
  <text start="141.13" dur="5.73">thousand pages gone in a split second</text>
  <text start="144.07" dur="6.449">and google has never given naturalnews a</text>
  <text start="146.86" dur="5.97">reason now from everyone out there</text>
  <text start="150.519" dur="5.22">talking about it everyone signing the</text>
  <text start="152.83" dur="7.58">petition it looks like google has</text>
  <text start="155.739" dur="7.111">reinstated natural news right now and</text>
  <text start="160.41" dur="4.51">what has happened here is that there</text>
  <text start="162.85" dur="4.02">were never any allegations or evidence</text>
  <text start="164.92" dur="3.51">that natural news had intentionally</text>
  <text start="166.87" dur="5.64">violated Google&amp;#39;s webmaster guidelines</text>
  <text start="168.43" dur="6.36">and Google said that the site was being</text>
  <text start="172.51" dur="4.56">flagged for a so-called sneaky mobile</text>
  <text start="174.79" dur="4.8">redirect on a very small number of pages</text>
  <text start="177.07" dur="5.639">in a sub-domain which was blogs at</text>
  <text start="179.59" dur="6.57">naturalnews com and this was created for</text>
  <text start="182.709" dur="5.12">outside bloggers and Google went to the</text>
  <text start="186.16" dur="4.169">extraordinary step of banning the entire</text>
  <text start="187.829" dur="5.711">site now there was no evidence no</text>
  <text start="190.329" dur="7.59">charges but you&amp;#39;re guilty because they</text>
  <text start="193.54" dur="9.949">say you are so this entire process was</text>
  <text start="197.919" dur="9.54">guilty and you&amp;#39;re not innocent at all</text>
  <text start="203.489" dur="5.801">you have to prove your innocence so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="207.459" dur="4.381">happening the opposite way instead of</text>
  <text start="209.29" dur="4.8">your innocent and they have to prove</text>
  <text start="211.84" dur="4.769">your guilt you&amp;#39;re guilty and you have to</text>
  <text start="214.09" dur="5.429">prove your innocence but we can see that</text>
  <text start="216.609" dur="5.671">Google they really had no reason to do</text>
  <text start="219.519" dur="5.22">this and we can see that the site was</text>
  <text start="222.28" dur="5.07">brought up now was this a test to see</text>
  <text start="224.739" dur="4.59">how people reacted were they testing to</text>
  <text start="227.35" dur="3.33">see can they get away with this and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="229.329" dur="3.181">not just talking about Google I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="230.68" dur="6.33">talking about the deep state behind all</text>
  <text start="232.51" dur="6.12">of this well one thing we do know and it</text>
  <text start="237.01" dur="4.05">just came out that there was a newly</text>
  <text start="238.63" dur="5.75">declassified document that shows that</text>
  <text start="241.06" dur="5.639">the CIA works closely with owners</text>
  <text start="244.38" dur="5.77">journalists with many of the largest</text>
  <text start="246.699" dur="5.361">media outlets now that probably is not a</text>
  <text start="250.15" dur="4.95">surprise to many people out there</text>
  <text start="252.06" dur="5.62">because many of us realize and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="255.1" dur="6.509">seen other documentation that the CIA is</text>
  <text start="257.68" dur="5.37">in bed with the corporate media and the</text>
  <text start="261.609" dur="2.851">united states senate select committee to</text>
  <text start="263.05" dur="3.869">study governmental operations with</text>
  <text start="264.46" dur="5.64">respect to intelligence activities found</text>
  <text start="266.919" dur="7.051">in 1975 that the CIA submitted stories</text>
  <text start="270.1" dur="6.42">to the american press and fast forward</text>
  <text start="273.97" dur="7.35">today the same exact thing is happening</text>
  <text start="276.52" dur="7.02">with one caveat because the government</text>
  <text start="281.32" dur="4.62">right now is still paying off reporters</text>
  <text start="283.54" dur="4.74">to spread disinformation and the</text>
  <text start="285.94" dur="5.13">corporate media are acting like virtual</text>
  <text start="288.28" dur="6.06">escort services for the moneyed elites</text>
  <text start="291.07" dur="5.19">selling access for a price to powerful</text>
  <text start="294.34" dur="3.63">government officials instead of actually</text>
  <text start="296.26" dur="6.39">investigating and reporting on what</text>
  <text start="297.97" dur="6.09">those officials are doing now one of the</text>
  <text start="302.65" dur="3.63">ways the US government spreads</text>
  <text start="304.06" dur="5.73">propaganda is by making sure that it</text>
  <text start="306.28" dur="5.55">gets its version out first there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="309.79" dur="4.02">proof we&amp;#39;ve seen this before they just</text>
  <text start="311.83" dur="3.45">put it out there it&amp;#39;s propaganda they</text>
  <text start="313.81" dur="3.18">never show their so</text>
  <text start="315.28" dur="4.14">versus where this information is coming</text>
  <text start="316.99" dur="4.74">from its always anonymous sometimes</text>
  <text start="319.42" dur="3.6">there&amp;#39;s no information whatsoever and we</text>
  <text start="321.73" dur="4.92">have to remember something very</text>
  <text start="323.02" dur="6.3">important in 2013 the American Congress</text>
  <text start="326.65" dur="4.89">repealed the formal ban against the</text>
  <text start="329.32" dur="6.24">deployment of propaganda against the US</text>
  <text start="331.54" dur="8.73">citizens living on American soil so they</text>
  <text start="335.56" dur="7.109">can use propaganda on the people of the</text>
  <text start="340.27" dur="6.57">United States and this is why you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="342.669" dur="6.091">seen propaganda sore since 2013 this is</text>
  <text start="346.84" dur="4.86">why they just come out with whatever</text>
  <text start="348.76" dur="4.8">they want to say and they don&amp;#39;t show any</text>
  <text start="351.7" dur="4.65">proof but when they&amp;#39;re called on the</text>
  <text start="353.56" dur="5.31">show proof guess what they can&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="356.35" dur="4.92">and most of the corporate media right</text>
  <text start="358.87" dur="4.14">now I&amp;#39;m talking about the important</text>
  <text start="361.27" dur="3.93">stories the stories that matter i&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="363.01" dur="4.86">talking about the local stories in your</text>
  <text start="365.2" dur="4.62">neighborhood or what an actress says or</text>
  <text start="367.87" dur="4.62">what Kardashians are doing I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="369.82" dur="4.8">about real stories what&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="372.49" dur="4.95">the Middle East what&amp;#39;s happening with</text>
  <text start="374.62" dur="7.89">the monetary system the information that</text>
  <text start="377.44" dur="8.729">affects everyone guess what they use</text>
  <text start="382.51" dur="6.54">propaganda they omit things they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="386.169" dur="6.211">tell you everything and from this newly</text>
  <text start="389.05" dur="6.51">declassified document well it shows once</text>
  <text start="392.38" dur="6.599">again this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="395.56" dur="6.359">now something interesting happened with</text>
  <text start="398.979" dur="6.121">the European Union and the French</text>
  <text start="401.919" dur="6.801">presidential candidate marine lepen they</text>
  <text start="405.1" dur="5.79">took away her parliamentary immunity</text>
  <text start="408.72" dur="4.39">she&amp;#39;s been charged with publishing</text>
  <text start="410.89" dur="4.32">violent images on her Twitter account of</text>
  <text start="413.11" dur="4.35">graphic images of terrace beheading</text>
  <text start="415.21" dur="4.65">prisoners one of whom was a u.s.</text>
  <text start="417.46" dur="4.14">journalist now the EU voted</text>
  <text start="419.86" dur="4.2">overwhelmingly to were to remove the</text>
  <text start="421.6" dur="6.87">Pens immunity now we know that she&amp;#39;s up</text>
  <text start="424.06" dur="8.22">for an election coming up very soon in</text>
  <text start="428.47" dur="7.02">France and we know that she wants to</text>
  <text start="432.28" dur="6.24">pull away from the EU that she sees the</text>

  <text start="444.43" dur="4.539">calling out that that was like a coup</text>
  <text start="446.409" dur="4.9">d&amp;#39;etat Crimea really belongs to Russia</text>
  <text start="448.969" dur="4.92">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="451.309" dur="4.73">by removing this immunity because the</text>
  <text start="453.889" dur="7.4">immunity shields her from prosecution</text>
  <text start="456.039" dur="9.91">well now she can be prosecuted for</text>
  <text start="461.289" dur="6.97">anything and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>

  <text start="490.879" dur="5.34">going to say Russia manipulated them</text>
  <text start="492.649" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re trying to suppress or get rid of</text>
  <text start="496.219" dur="4.38">the other candidates and you can see</text>
  <text start="498.619" dur="3.6">that this is happening in many different</text>
  <text start="500.599" dur="4.86">countries because these individuals</text>
  <text start="502.219" dur="7.88">they&amp;#39;re afraid of losing their power</text>
  <text start="505.459" dur="8.73">they&amp;#39;re afraid of losing the election</text>
  <text start="510.099" dur="7.87">because what will they become they will</text>
  <text start="514.189" dur="6.12">lose their control and if these other</text>
  <text start="517.969" dur="4.47">individuals are put into place like here</text>

  <text start="567.439" dur="4.411">don&amp;#39;t want this in here but we can see</text>
  <text start="570.23" dur="4.409">that they&amp;#39;re not going to be listen to</text>
  <text start="571.85" dur="4.02">the sound system will be placed in South</text>
  <text start="574.639" dur="5.64">Korea because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="575.87" dur="6.57">now is a huge push in the agenda to</text>
  <text start="580.279" dur="4.881">provoke North Korea</text>
  <text start="582.44" dur="5.28">since the assassination of Kim Jong Un&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="585.16" dur="4.33">half-brother we can see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="587.72" dur="3.45">making the play to say that North Korea</text>
  <text start="589.49" dur="4.98">has chemical weapons down they started</text>
  <text start="591.17" dur="5.82">out over the weekend saying this and now</text>
  <text start="594.47" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;re building this up because South</text>
  <text start="596.99" dur="5.1">Korea is out there they are warning that</text>
  <text start="599.45" dur="4.8">North Korea has thousands of tons of</text>
  <text start="602.09" dur="4.97">chemical weapons laying dormant across</text>
  <text start="604.25" dur="4.98">the country waiting to be used and</text>
  <text start="607.06" dur="4.51">they&amp;#39;re saying that the assassination of</text>
  <text start="609.23" dur="5.64">Kim Jong Un&amp;#39;s brother proves they are</text>
  <text start="611.57" dur="6.06">willing to use them now this is coming</text>
  <text start="614.87" dur="4.71">from south korea this is all part of the</text>
  <text start="617.63" dur="4.32">agenda to bring in more military assets</text>
  <text start="619.58" dur="4.41">into the region this is a way to provoke</text>
  <text start="621.95" dur="4.8">North Korea they did this the same thing</text>
  <text start="623.99" dur="3.96">in Syria with Assad with his chemical</text>
  <text start="626.75" dur="3.27">weapons you can see they&amp;#39;re using the</text>
  <text start="627.95" dur="3.9">same narrative nothing has changed</text>
  <text start="630.02" dur="4.95">because they&amp;#39;re going to make their move</text>
  <text start="631.85" dur="5.49">in North Korea and most likely this is</text>
  <text start="634.97" dur="3.66">why China step back where they said you</text>
  <text start="637.34" dur="4.14">know what we&amp;#39;re now going to import</text>
  <text start="638.63" dur="5.16">their coal from North Korea we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="641.48" dur="3.81">want to be a part of this and we can see</text>
  <text start="643.79" dur="3.51">that they&amp;#39;re pushing for regime change</text>
  <text start="645.29" dur="4.14">in North Korea and I have a funny</text>
  <text start="647.3" dur="4.38">feeling things are really going to heat</text>
  <text start="649.43" dur="4.65">up in this area and we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="651.68" dur="5.67">something happen now there&amp;#39;s a new</text>

  <text start="657.35" dur="5.58">different failures in the cruise missile</text>
  <text start="660.02" dur="6.6">intercept which eliminates enemy threats</text>
  <text start="662.93" dur="6.06">now these are the warheads that fire</text>
  <text start="666.62" dur="5.07">from smaller scale nuclear powers like</text>
  <text start="668.99" dur="3.96">North Korea as one example which we</text>
  <text start="671.69" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t even know if they really have no</text>
  <text start="672.95" dur="4.77">nuclear weapons that can be mounted on</text>
  <text start="675.56" dur="5.4">missiles so they&amp;#39;re really talking about</text>
  <text start="677.72" dur="4.71">Iran they&amp;#39;re talking about Russia but</text>
  <text start="680.96" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s been a lot of problems as the</text>

  <text start="685.13" dur="7.01">midcourse defense system is maintained</text>
  <text start="688.55" dur="7.35">by the Pentagon and it&amp;#39;s supposed to</text>
  <text start="692.14" dur="6.25">limit the nuclear strikes coming from</text>
  <text start="695.9" dur="5.7">these different countries and what is</text>
  <text start="698.39" dur="6.36">happening here is that the interceptors</text>
  <text start="701.6" dur="5.85">thrusters fail during simulation tests</text>
  <text start="704.75" dur="5.7">they don&amp;#39;t work causing the interceptor</text>
  <text start="707.45" dur="8.22">to stray from its flight path but also</text>
  <text start="710.45" dur="6.9">on top of this the GMD contractors well</text>
  <text start="715.67" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;re saying that everything has been</text>
  <text start="717.35" dur="7.8">successful and when we look at this GAO</text>
  <text start="721.7" dur="6.57">report the GMD flight testing to date</text>
  <text start="725.15" dur="6.84">was insufficient and it shows that these</text>
  <text start="728.27" dur="6.75">systems do not work so it looks like</text>
  <text start="731.99" dur="5.07">these missile defense systems they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="735.02" dur="5.16">lemons they don&amp;#39;t work they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="737.06" dur="5.37">to protect against anything now it looks</text>
  <text start="740.18" dur="6.18">like the United States is pushing more</text>
  <text start="742.43" dur="5.01">sanctions on Syria and Putin is out</text>
  <text start="746.36" dur="3.18">there saying this is completely</text>
  <text start="747.44" dur="3.84">inappropriate at this point in time to</text>
  <text start="749.54" dur="5.55">introduce new sanctions against the</text>
  <text start="751.28" dur="5.58">Syrian government and we can see that it</text>
  <text start="755.09" dur="3.93">doesn&amp;#39;t matter because the deep state</text>
  <text start="756.86" dur="4.38">essential bankers they&amp;#39;re pushing their</text>
  <text start="759.02" dur="4.56">agenda they have a goal they want</text>
  <text start="761.24" dur="5.43">Damascus or they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="763.58" dur="5.34">split up Syria I mean it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="766.67" dur="4.89">the them at this point as long as they</text>
  <text start="768.92" dur="4.08">can get this gas pipeline in as long as</text>
  <text start="771.56" dur="2.4">they can get part of Syria because you</text>
  <text start="773" dur="4.32">know they&amp;#39;re going to go after the other</text>
  <text start="773.96" dur="5.13">part later wrong and the UN Security</text>
  <text start="777.32" dur="4.71">Council will vote on Tuesday on a</text>
  <text start="779.09" dur="4.74">proposal and it looks like Russia is</text>
  <text start="782.03" dur="7.26">going to veto this now they&amp;#39;re bringing</text>
  <text start="783.83" dur="8.7">up the entire propaganda about chemical</text>
  <text start="789.29" dur="5.97">weapons in Syria how Assad has been</text>
  <text start="792.53" dur="5.73">using chemical weapons and from every</text>
  <text start="795.26" dur="5.19">report that is out there it shows that</text>
  <text start="798.26" dur="5.31">the moderate rebels the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="800.45" dur="6.66">al-qaeda the terrorists have been using</text>
  <text start="803.57" dur="6.41">these chemical weapons we see US Special</text>
  <text start="807.11" dur="6.18">Forces they have arrived and manage and</text>
  <text start="809.98" dur="6.3">they have enforced the demarcation line</text>
  <text start="813.29" dur="6.3">in north in Syria and we can see that</text>
  <text start="816.28" dur="7.54">weapons now are coming in into the</text>
  <text start="819.59" dur="6.18">Kurdish region and we can see that more</text>
  <text start="823.82" dur="3.99">and more weapons are coming into this</text>
  <text start="825.77" dur="4.23">area we understand the Pentagon is</text>
  <text start="827.81" dur="3.81">trying to push troops into this area we</text>
  <text start="830" dur="3.66">know Saudi Arabia wants to bring troops</text>
  <text start="831.62" dur="4.11">into this area and we can see that</text>
  <text start="833.66" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re going to be trying to push their</text>
  <text start="835.73" dur="4.38">agenda to get Assad I mean this is what</text>
  <text start="838.1" dur="3.39">it looks like right now now the</text>
  <text start="840.11" dur="3.93">Pentagon&amp;#39;s counterterrorism chief</text>
  <text start="841.49" dur="4.05">lieutenant general Michael nagata he is</text>
  <text start="844.04" dur="3.78">warning that the terrorists have</text>
  <text start="845.54" dur="2.97">demonstrated the clear intention to use</text>
  <text start="847.82" dur="4.05">drew</text>
  <text start="848.51" dur="4.74">owns and you know the little handheld</text>
  <text start="851.87" dur="3">drones that they throw up in the air</text>
  <text start="853.25" dur="4.34">this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="854.87" dur="6.5">us of that they&amp;#39;re using these highly</text>
  <text start="857.59" dur="6.22">maneuverable Lethal Weapon drones and</text>
  <text start="861.37" dur="6.58">they&amp;#39;re making the case where they need</text>
  <text start="863.81" dur="6.84">to bring in these drone swarms and what</text>
  <text start="867.95" dur="6.33">it is is that there&amp;#39;s drones from the</text>
  <text start="870.65" dur="6">United States which are all linked</text>
  <text start="874.28" dur="5.61">together and it looks like a gigantic</text>
  <text start="876.65" dur="5.13">swarm and they all can be controlled to</text>
  <text start="879.89" dur="4.35">do different maneuvers and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="881.78" dur="4.26">hundreds of them and they want to bring</text>
  <text start="884.24" dur="3.42">them into Syria because they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="886.04" dur="3.81">difficult to knock out of the sky and</text>
  <text start="887.66" dur="5.82">when there&amp;#39;s a lot of them and when</text>
  <text start="889.85" dur="5.97">they&amp;#39;re armed they are lethal and we can</text>
  <text start="893.48" dur="3.84">see right now this is what they want to</text>
  <text start="895.82" dur="5.1">do in there because this is part of the</text>
  <text start="897.32" dur="5.25">plan to go after Assad now the Syrian</text>
  <text start="900.92" dur="4.11">opposition is out there and they are</text>
  <text start="902.57" dur="5.85">claiming they have solid evidence that</text>
  <text start="905.03" dur="6.84">the Syrian government is cooperating</text>
  <text start="908.42" dur="4.98">with the Islamic state and they have</text>
  <text start="911.87" dur="6.6">visual evidence that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="913.4" dur="8.63">supply to the UN now this is kind of</text>
  <text start="918.47" dur="8.31">ridiculous because they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="922.03" dur="7.75">Assad allowed the Islamic state to take</text>
  <text start="926.78" dur="4.62">control of Palmyra so you&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="929.78" dur="4.68">Russia and the Syrian armed forces</text>
  <text start="931.4" dur="8.43">fought like crazy to take back Palmyra</text>
  <text start="934.46" dur="6.81">and then Assad decided you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="939.83" dur="3.12">going to let the Islamic state have it</text>
  <text start="941.27" dur="5.19">back I mean that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="942.95" dur="5.34">to say and further allegations included</text>
  <text start="946.46" dur="5.18">close cooperation and coordination</text>
  <text start="948.29" dur="6.24">between the government and Isis in homes</text>
  <text start="951.64" dur="5.58">well again that sounds absolutely</text>
  <text start="954.53" dur="7.23">ridiculous what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is</text>
  <text start="957.22" dur="7.45">shift who has relations with the Islamic</text>
  <text start="961.76" dur="7.41">state but it&amp;#39;s not going to work because</text>
  <text start="964.67" dur="6.84">Russia and Syria has actual evidence</text>
  <text start="969.17" dur="4.47">remember that whole entire mop-up job</text>
  <text start="971.51" dur="4.56">where the Special Forces went into</text>
  <text start="973.64" dur="5.85">certain areas retrieve documentation</text>
  <text start="976.07" dur="6.509">destroyed certain areas with bombings</text>
  <text start="979.49" dur="5.759">inside of Syria inside of Iraq</text>
  <text start="982.579" dur="5.13">well that was done on purpose because</text>
  <text start="985.249" dur="3.661">they didn&amp;#39;t want anyone to find out that</text>
  <text start="987.709" dur="2.581">there was a connection between the</text>
  <text start="988.91" dur="5.609">united states government central bankers</text>
  <text start="990.29" dur="6.329">and the Islamic state but Russia and</text>
  <text start="994.519" dur="5.61">Syria they have evidence they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="996.619" dur="6.45">provided evidence that they are involved</text>
  <text start="1000.129" dur="5.07">actually Iraq has provided evidence that</text>
  <text start="1003.069" dur="5.401">the Islamic state and the United States</text>
  <text start="1005.199" dur="6.18">government central bankers well they</text>
  <text start="1008.47" dur="8.039">work together the u.s. supports drops</text>
  <text start="1011.379" dur="8.601">humanitarian aid drops ammunition gives</text>
  <text start="1016.509" dur="6.24">them support because think about it all</text>
  <text start="1019.98" dur="6.569">this time there were convoys of oil</text>
  <text start="1022.749" dur="6.57">trucks leaving Syria going into Turkey</text>
  <text start="1026.549" dur="5.41">you can see it from the satellites</text>
  <text start="1029.319" dur="5.911">completely obvious and throughout the</text>
  <text start="1031.959" dur="5.97">entire year the United States did</text>
  <text start="1035.23" dur="4.859">nothing about it until Russia pointed it</text>
  <text start="1037.929" dur="4.441">out and started to destroy the convoy</text>
  <text start="1040.089" dur="5.1">then the u.s. to save face said okay</text>
  <text start="1042.37" dur="5.159">we&amp;#39;ll destroy the convoy first but will</text>
  <text start="1045.189" dur="4.381">destroy the convoy also and what we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1047.529" dur="4.411">do is when no one&amp;#39;s looking we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1049.57" dur="4.589">to drop leaflets so our paid mercenaries</text>
  <text start="1051.94" dur="6.53">get out of the truck before we destroy</text>
  <text start="1054.159" dur="7.591">the convoy they gave them a warning and</text>
  <text start="1058.47" dur="5.589">we can see right now that they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1061.75" dur="3.63">to create this narrative it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="1064.059" dur="4.62">to work they&amp;#39;ve tried so many different</text>
  <text start="1065.38" dur="6.929">things and it just doesn&amp;#39;t work now it</text>
  <text start="1068.679" dur="6.48">looks like the deep state they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1072.309" dur="5.34">to get the United States into a nuclear</text>
  <text start="1075.159" dur="4.11">confrontation that&amp;#39;s what it seems like</text>
  <text start="1077.649" dur="5.041">on the service because we know that</text>
  <text start="1079.269" dur="6.39">Trump when he was campaigning he wanted</text>
  <text start="1082.69" dur="4.65">to rebuild the US military by diverting</text>
  <text start="1085.659" dur="4.081">a lot more funding into the armed forces</text>
  <text start="1087.34" dur="4.11">and it wasn&amp;#39;t just the conventional</text>
  <text start="1089.74" dur="3.63">forces he wanted to build up the nuclear</text>
  <text start="1091.45" dur="4.43">arsenal now I think we should be gone</text>
  <text start="1093.37" dur="5.01">the other way I think we should be</text>
  <text start="1095.88" dur="4.21">getting rid of Newton the nuclear</text>
  <text start="1098.38" dur="4.47">arsenal making deals with China and</text>
  <text start="1100.09" dur="5.549">Russia like we had before and limiting</text>
  <text start="1102.85" dur="5.22">the amount of nuclear weapons but he</text>
  <text start="1105.639" dur="3.811">wants to do the opposite and according</text>
  <text start="1108.07" dur="4.64">to the report the defense Science Board</text>
  <text start="1109.45" dur="6.57">it urges the President to consider</text>
  <text start="1112.71" dur="5.29">altering existing and planned us are</text>
  <text start="1116.02" dur="3.96">to achieve a greater number of lower</text>
  <text start="1118" dur="5.87">yield weapons that could provide a</text>
  <text start="1119.98" dur="6.75">tailored nuclear option for limited use</text>
  <text start="1123.87" dur="5.8">the strategy behind limited nuclear use</text>
  <text start="1126.73" dur="5.76">sounds deceptively simple you need to</text>
  <text start="1129.67" dur="6.21">escalate a conflict just enough to end</text>
  <text start="1132.49" dur="5.21">it as the theory goes using low-yield</text>
  <text start="1135.88" dur="3.99">nuclear weapons against an adversaries</text>
  <text start="1137.7" dur="4.63">conventional forces will demonstrate</text>
  <text start="1139.87" dur="4.62">that you mean serious business and might</text>
  <text start="1142.33" dur="5.91">be crazy enough to launch an all-out</text>
  <text start="1144.49" dur="6">nuclear attack now this supposedly will</text>
  <text start="1148.24" dur="5.34">cause the enemy to blink and ultimately</text>
  <text start="1150.49" dur="8.25">back down rather than risk a global</text>
  <text start="1153.58" dur="8.01">nuclear war well as we know these</text>
  <text start="1158.74" dur="4.86">nuclear States they&amp;#39;re not going to back</text>
  <text start="1161.59" dur="4.95">down they&amp;#39;re going to see a nuclear</text>
  <text start="1163.6" dur="4.59">weapon go off in their country they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1166.54" dur="6.57">going to use their nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="1168.19" dur="8.7">against the United States so this plan</text>
  <text start="1173.11" dur="5.31">is not going to work because any limited</text>
  <text start="1176.89" dur="4.53">nuclear war would eventually lead to a</text>
  <text start="1178.42" dur="5.28">full-scale nuclear war the linchpin of a</text>
  <text start="1181.42" dur="4.47">limited nuclear war is the tactical nuke</text>
  <text start="1183.7" dur="4.95">these are nuclear weapons that have a</text>
  <text start="1185.89" dur="4.83">much smaller yield than a strategic nuke</text>
  <text start="1188.65" dur="4.41">but those countries like China like</text>
  <text start="1190.72" dur="4.56">Russia they&amp;#39;re going to see a nuclear</text>
  <text start="1193.06" dur="5.57">detonation and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1195.28" dur="6.84">retaliate and we have a problem with our</text>
  <text start="1198.63" dur="6.37">missile shield system where they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1202.12" dur="5.28">work the thrusters don&amp;#39;t work they veer</text>
  <text start="1205" dur="5.46">off course the whole thing is a huge</text>
  <text start="1207.4" dur="6.03">problem maybe we should just cancel war</text>
  <text start="1210.46" dur="5.88">altogether maybe we should go for peace</text>
  <text start="1213.43" dur="5.97">instead but we know the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1216.34" dur="6.33">the deep state they are pushing for a</text>
  <text start="1219.4" dur="7.11">war this is why they&amp;#39;re going down this</text>
  <text start="1222.67" dur="8.37">route they&amp;#39;re maneuvering they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1226.51" dur="8.82">pushing their agenda because as the</text>
  <text start="1231.04" dur="7.41">economy continually deteriorates things</text>
  <text start="1235.33" dur="7.74">get worse they need a cover up they need</text>
  <text start="1238.45" dur="6.27">a story before it is blamed on them we</text>
  <text start="1243.07" dur="4.56">already know that Janet Yellen was out</text>
  <text start="1244.72" dur="4.89">there saying listen the economy is</text>
  <text start="1247.63" dur="5.49">disappointing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1249.61" dur="8.28">and don&amp;#39;t blame the Fed if things go</text>
  <text start="1253.12" dur="7.32">wrong and we can see already through all</text>
  <text start="1257.89" dur="3.87">the economic data things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="1260.44" dur="3.39">deteriorating and they were hoping to</text>
  <text start="1261.76" dur="5.19">have a war to cover this up because it</text>
  <text start="1263.83" dur="5.79">is a perfect way to cover up what is</text>
  <text start="1266.95" dur="5.729">about to happen because all eyes would</text>
  <text start="1269.62" dur="7.02">be focused on the war then they can say</text>
  <text start="1272.679" dur="6.331">okay everyone has to sacrifice everyone</text>
  <text start="1276.64" dur="4.68">you will not be getting food we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1279.01" dur="4.44">to have to ration food because remember</text>
  <text start="1281.32" dur="4.5">when this happens the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="1283.45" dur="3.51">doesn&amp;#39;t go away credit markets are still</text>
  <text start="1285.82" dur="4.71">going to freeze up which we see</text>
  <text start="1286.96" dur="5.82">happening already supplies will dry up</text>
  <text start="1290.53" dur="4.83">we can&amp;#39;t manufacturing it we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1292.78" dur="5.49">manufacture anything ourselves the</text>
  <text start="1295.36" dur="6.51">imports will slow down it will be a</text>
  <text start="1298.27" dur="6.42">complete disaster the rest of the world</text>
  <text start="1301.87" dur="5.299">will lose faith in the dollar they will</text>
  <text start="1304.69" dur="4.2">start dumping Treasuries like crazy</text>
  <text start="1307.169" dur="4.931">because they&amp;#39;re going to be getting</text>
  <text start="1308.89" dur="5.25">ready for war and the economy here and</text>
  <text start="1312.1" dur="3.81">the people living here it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1314.14" dur="3.63">a disaster for quite a while now cliff</text>
  <text start="1315.91" dur="5.67">high is saying this is going to last for</text>
  <text start="1317.77" dur="5.85">five years so my suggestion to everyone</text>
  <text start="1321.58" dur="3.63">is get prepared for what is coming</text>
  <text start="1323.62" dur="4.08">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="1325.21" dur="5.55">what happened in 2008 but this is on</text>
  <text start="1327.7" dur="6.69">steroids this is going to be much worse</text>
  <text start="1330.76" dur="6.39">and it&amp;#39;s get that time frame is getting</text>
  <text start="1334.39" dur="4.8">closer and closer listen everyone thanks</text>
  <text start="1337.15" dur="6.17">a lot for listening be well be safe and</text>
