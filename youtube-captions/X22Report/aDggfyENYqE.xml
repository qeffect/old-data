  <text start="118.12" dur="4.53">system</text>
  <text start="118.89" dur="6.22">take for example where Trump went ahead</text>
  <text start="122.65" dur="4.56">and he signed the Hong Kong bill now</text>
  <text start="125.11" dur="4.59">when we look at China we can see this</text>
  <text start="127.21" dur="6.93">put pressure on the Chinese government</text>
  <text start="129.7" dur="7.17">we also understand that China is not</text>
  <text start="134.14" dur="3.44">doing well remember Trump has tariffs in</text>

  <text start="137.58" dur="6.239">Manufacturing&amp;#39;s our manufacturers are</text>
  <text start="139.87" dur="8.19">moving out and we can see that Hong Kong</text>
  <text start="143.819" dur="6.28">their retail industry is declining when</text>
  <text start="148.06" dur="4.2">we look at the month of October retail</text>
  <text start="150.099" dur="5.67">sales they have plunged by twenty four</text>
  <text start="152.26" dur="6.78">point three percent year over a year but</text>
  <text start="155.769" dur="4.711">this was by far the worst print on</text>
  <text start="159.04" dur="3.479">record</text>
  <text start="160.48" dur="6.089">as the tourist industry in the last six</text>
  <text start="162.519" dur="6.421">months has completely evaporated GDP</text>
  <text start="166.569" dur="6.511">right now in Hong Kong was revised lower</text>
  <text start="168.94" dur="6.87">for a full year growth to negative 1.3</text>
  <text start="173.08" dur="6.689">percent that marked the first annual</text>
  <text start="175.81" dur="5.789">decline since 2009 now Chinese</text>

  <text start="184.9" dur="4.58">struggling and it looks like the Chinese</text>
  <text start="187.72" dur="6.54">economy is having a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="189.48" dur="7.93">this is to put pressure on China put</text>
  <text start="194.26" dur="7.949">pressure on the entire central bank</text>
  <text start="197.41" dur="7.109">system this goes way beyond China and we</text>
  <text start="202.209" dur="5.37">know that Trump right now</text>
  <text start="204.519" dur="4.83">he likes the tariffs in place he</text>
  <text start="207.579" dur="3.3">actually said that he doesn&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="209.349" dur="4.351">deadline for reaching a trade agreement</text>
  <text start="210.879" dur="4.531">with China in some ways it might be</text>
  <text start="213.7" dur="5.039">better to wait until 2020</text>
  <text start="215.41" dur="7.04">after the 2020 election to actually</text>
  <text start="218.739" dur="7.441">reach a deal now why is he doing this</text>
  <text start="222.45" dur="7.48">he&amp;#39;s doing this because it&amp;#39;s not a trade</text>
  <text start="226.18" dur="7.559">war it&amp;#39;s not a currency war it&amp;#39;s a war</text>
  <text start="229.93" dur="6.54">on the central bank system and what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="233.739" dur="4.771">doing right now is he&amp;#39;s evening out the</text>
  <text start="236.47" dur="3.51">playing field now while he&amp;#39;s evening out</text>
  <text start="238.51" dur="4.229">the playing field and what I mean by</text>
  <text start="239.98" dur="5.539">that he&amp;#39;s renegotiate a lot of the trade</text>
  <text start="242.739" dur="6.03">deals or creating new trade deals and</text>
  <text start="245.519" dur="7.601">why all this is happening he&amp;#39;s setting</text>
  <text start="248.769" dur="6.81">up the transitional economic system this</text>
  <text start="253.12" dur="5.33">is why he needs the u.s. MCA passed so</text>
  <text start="255.579" dur="6.421">bad and this is why they pushed so hard</text>
  <text start="258.45" dur="5.56">to get that ruling against the EU in the</text>
  <text start="262" dur="3.539">World Trade Organization which we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="264.01" dur="3.54">talk about in just a minute so we can</text>
  <text start="265.539" dur="3.861">make sense of all this but what is</text>
  <text start="267.55" dur="5.369">happening right now since this ruling</text>
  <text start="269.4" dur="6.04">the World Trade Organization panel ruled</text>
  <text start="272.919" dur="5.761">right now that the European Union they</text>
  <text start="275.44" dur="6.599">haven&amp;#39;t complied with in order to to end</text>
  <text start="278.68" dur="5.73">illegal subsidies for plane maker Airbus</text>
  <text start="282.039" dur="3.871">and this is what prompted the Trump</text>
  <text start="284.41" dur="5.309">administration to impose tariffs are</text>
  <text start="285.91" dur="6.87">nearly 7.5 billion u.s. worth of EU</text>
  <text start="289.719" dur="5.611">goods in October now in its ruling</text>
  <text start="292.78" dur="5.46">the WTO compliance panel found that the</text>
  <text start="295.33" dur="5.76">EU and not taken sufficient steps to end</text>
  <text start="298.24" dur="6.12">harm to Boeing the major rival in</text>
  <text start="301.09" dur="4.98">Europe&amp;#39;s Airbus the EU is expected to</text>
  <text start="304.36" dur="4.56">appeal though the United States is on</text>
  <text start="306.07" dur="6.78">the cusp of preventing the WTO&amp;#39;s appeals</text>
  <text start="308.92" dur="8.04">court from ruling on any new appeals now</text>
  <text start="312.85" dur="6.99">why was this so important why was the</text>
  <text start="316.96" dur="5.01">WTO ruling so important for the Trump</text>
  <text start="319.84" dur="6.27">administration and for this transitional</text>
  <text start="321.97" dur="7.47">economic system now keep in mind a final</text>
  <text start="326.11" dur="6.23">WTO ruling means the EU cannot retaliate</text>
  <text start="329.44" dur="7.04">against any WTO authorized</text>
  <text start="332.34" dur="8.83">countermeasures so what does that mean</text>
  <text start="336.48" dur="8.53">what makes this incredible and excellent</text>
  <text start="341.17" dur="5.67">is the timing for brexit if Boris</text>
  <text start="345.01" dur="4.95">Johnson can get out of the EU without</text>
  <text start="346.84" dur="5.79">strings Trump can use these WTO</text>
  <text start="349.96" dur="6.39">authorized WTO authorized tariffs to</text>
  <text start="352.63" dur="8.31">position a UK trade deal with the US as</text>
  <text start="356.35" dur="9.6">a trade superhighway and this plays</text>
  <text start="360.94" dur="8.34">right into Trump&amp;#39;s hands into a global</text>
  <text start="365.95" dur="6.5">trade realignment Trump&amp;#39;s goal is</text>
  <text start="369.28" dur="6.09">reciprocity however the EU and Asia</text>
  <text start="372.45" dur="5.29">specifically China don&amp;#39;t want to give up</text>
  <text start="375.37" dur="5.33">decades-long multi-generational</text>
  <text start="377.74" dur="6.44">advantage and this is part of the fight</text>
  <text start="380.7" dur="7.48">but with this ruling remember the EU</text>
  <text start="384.18" dur="6.52">cannot retaliate and this is very</text>
  <text start="388.18" dur="6.42">important and this is why they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="390.7" dur="6.3">want to abide by the WTO ruling and this</text>
  <text start="394.6" dur="4.65">is why Trump says no this is the ruling</text>
  <text start="397" dur="3.36">and that is it and I&amp;#39;m not saying him</text>
  <text start="399.25" dur="3.75">specifically I&amp;#39;m talking about his whole</text>
  <text start="400.36" dur="5.79">administration it gives them leverage</text>
  <text start="403" dur="6.12">and this is what Trump is all about it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="406.15" dur="6.66">about having leverage over countries</text>
  <text start="409.12" dur="7.56">over the central bank over the globalist</text>
  <text start="412.81" dur="7.71">system right now to shape it and pivot</text>
  <text start="416.68" dur="7.459">away from what they were trying to do</text>
  <text start="420.52" dur="8.63">that&amp;#39;s the entire plan here</text>
  <text start="424.139" dur="8.3">and as we can see Trump is continually</text>
  <text start="429.15" dur="6.509">hitting the fed and why is he doing this</text>
  <text start="432.439" dur="5.681">he&amp;#39;s doing this because the other</text>
  <text start="435.659" dur="3.84">central bank systems and I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="438.12" dur="3.419">they&amp;#39;re all separate and apart they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="439.499" dur="5.91">all part of the same exact thing but</text>
  <text start="441.539" dur="6.63">they&amp;#39;re trying to push Trump and the</text>
  <text start="445.409" dur="6.51">United States into the corner by</text>
  <text start="448.169" dur="8.46">continually devaluing their currency by</text>
  <text start="451.919" dur="7.05">lowering rates and the Fed was working</text>
  <text start="456.629" dur="4.921">in the opposite way because their entire</text>
  <text start="458.969" dur="3.211">plan was to destroy the economy blame it</text>
  <text start="461.55" dur="4.139">on Trump</text>
  <text start="462.18" dur="7.5">so Trump right now is battling this and</text>
  <text start="465.689" dur="5.311">using the Fed to battle what the central</text>
  <text start="469.68" dur="2.94">bankers were trying to do and I do</text>
  <text start="471" dur="4.139">believe he has control of the Federal</text>
  <text start="472.62" dur="3.75">Reserve he tweeted out the following the</text>
  <text start="475.139" dur="3.511">Fed should lower rates</text>
  <text start="476.37" dur="4.71">there is almost no inflation and loosin</text>
  <text start="478.65" dur="4.56">making up making us competitive with</text>
  <text start="481.08" dur="5.339">other nations and manufacturing will</text>
  <text start="483.21" dur="6.06">soar dollar is very strong relative to</text>
  <text start="486.419" dur="5.701">others he wants a weakened dollar he</text>
  <text start="489.27" dur="5.489">wants rates cut he wants stimulus and he</text>
  <text start="492.12" dur="4.469">needs to do this because all the other</text>
  <text start="494.759" dur="4.77">countries are being instructed to do</text>
  <text start="496.589" dur="5.521">this and he knows why the Patriots know</text>
  <text start="499.529" dur="4.92">why we know why because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="502.11" dur="6.69">panicking the central bank the deep</text>
  <text start="504.449" dur="6.69">state they are panicking Trump he&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="508.8" dur="5.489">the process of destroying the central</text>
  <text start="511.139" dur="4.981">bank globalist system and you can see by</text>
  <text start="514.289" dur="3.99">the mainstream medium what articles are</text>
  <text start="516.12" dur="3.87">putting out there you can tell that</text>
  <text start="518.279" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re panicked about this remember</text>
  <text start="519.99" dur="3.63">they started out that there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="521.729" dur="2.31">be a recession all the indicators point</text>
  <text start="523.62" dur="2.399">to it</text>
  <text start="524.039" dur="4.41">recessions coming recession recession</text>
  <text start="526.019" dur="4.5">recession then they kind of backed off</text>
  <text start="528.449" dur="4.5">of all of this because they knew it</text>
  <text start="530.519" dur="6.121">wasn&amp;#39;t going to happen they tried to</text>
  <text start="532.949" dur="6.841">push people into bringing this country</text>
  <text start="536.64" dur="5.16">into a recession but with everything</text>
  <text start="539.79" dur="5.039">that Trump is doing they couldn&amp;#39;t combat</text>
  <text start="541.8" dur="5.789">this so now they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="544.829" dur="3.681">a way to show everyone that he has no</text>
  <text start="547.589" dur="3.75">idea what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="548.51" dur="4.66">The Washington Post put out this article</text>
  <text start="551.339" dur="6.12">and they&amp;#39;re trying to make the case that</text>
  <text start="553.17" dur="7.949">Trump doesn&amp;#39;t understand currency war</text>
  <text start="557.459" dur="6.781">and that is exactly the title Trump</text>
  <text start="561.119" dur="4.65">doesn&amp;#39;t understand currency wars he</text>
  <text start="564.24" dur="2.759">doesn&amp;#39;t understand trade he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="568.86" dur="2.55">any of this</text>
  <text start="569.61" dur="3.63">of course he understands this he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="571.41" dur="4.979">businessman are you trying to tell me</text>
  <text start="573.24" dur="6.029">all the other presidents that came</text>
  <text start="576.389" dur="5.73">before him that had no clue in business</text>
  <text start="579.269" dur="8.85">or knew anything about business or built</text>

  <text start="588.119" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re trying to do and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="589.619" dur="6.301">to build a case to show the American</text>
  <text start="592.199" dur="7.95">people that he might start a war</text>
  <text start="595.92" dur="9.8">remember the phrase you have a trade war</text>
  <text start="600.149" dur="9.99">a currency war equals real war and Trump</text>
  <text start="605.72" dur="7.57">he is not going to push any type of an</text>

  <text start="619.92" dur="6.349">economic war not on a particular country</text>
  <text start="622.79" dur="7.959">it&amp;#39;s an economic war on the central bank</text>
  <text start="626.269" dur="7.38">system very very different and this is</text>
  <text start="630.749" dur="5.76">what they&amp;#39;re panicking about he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="633.649" dur="4.99">singling out a specific country this is</text>
  <text start="636.509" dur="4.56">what the central bank does they single</text>
