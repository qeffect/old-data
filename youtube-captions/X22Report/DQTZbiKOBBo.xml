  <text start="109.13" dur="5">indicators there they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="111.49" dur="5.11">deteriorating it&amp;#39;s not improving and</text>
  <text start="114.13" dur="4.69">those people who believe that all of a</text>
  <text start="116.6" dur="5.49">sudden this is going to turn around well</text>
  <text start="118.82" dur="5.07">I&amp;#39;m sorry to say it isn&amp;#39;t all of a</text>
  <text start="122.09" dur="3.54">sudden stores are not going to start</text>
  <text start="123.89" dur="3.839">opening up all over the place hiring</text>
  <text start="125.63" dur="4.859">people we&amp;#39;re not going to see</text>
  <text start="127.729" dur="4.201">manufacturing just turn around and all</text>
  <text start="130.489" dur="4.651">of a sudden we&amp;#39;re a manufacturing</text>
  <text start="131.93" dur="4.74">powerhouse all those people who are</text>
  <text start="135.14" dur="3.18">getting laid off now from companies</text>
  <text start="136.67" dur="4.789">they&amp;#39;re not just gonna all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="138.32" dur="8.31">just find jobs and start working again</text>
  <text start="141.459" dur="7.991">remember this has taken years to create</text>
  <text start="146.63" dur="6.71">what we have today and that is a failing</text>
  <text start="149.45" dur="6">economy they didn&amp;#39;t do it overnight and</text>
  <text start="153.34" dur="4.869">if you were paying attention you</text>
  <text start="155.45" dur="4.62">realized over time especially as we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="158.209" dur="5.581">been tracking this that it has gotten</text>
  <text start="160.07" dur="6.33">worse and worse since the beginning of</text>
  <text start="163.79" dur="5.819">when we started tracking this and if you</text>
  <text start="166.4" dur="5.79">go further back you can see how bad it</text>
  <text start="169.609" dur="5.071">is gotten now of course many people do</text>
  <text start="172.19" dur="4.919">believe that the economy is doing well</text>
  <text start="174.68" dur="5.279">everything is fine but we can see right</text>
  <text start="177.109" dur="6.74">now that that is furthest from the truth</text>
  <text start="179.959" dur="7.53">we are seeing more companies layoffs now</text>
  <text start="183.849" dur="4.181">than any other time except for the Great</text>
  <text start="187.489" dur="3.411">Recession</text>
  <text start="188.03" dur="5.549">or maybe the Great Depression of 1929</text>
  <text start="190.9" dur="4.72">but more and more corporations are</text>
  <text start="193.579" dur="4.74">deciding you know something we need to</text>
  <text start="195.62" dur="4.649">cut expenses so let&amp;#39;s let go some people</text>
  <text start="198.319" dur="5.611">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="200.269" dur="5.64">we saw this occur right before the</text>
  <text start="203.93" dur="4.07">market came down in 2008 and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="205.909" dur="4.291">seeing the same thing happen once again</text>
  <text start="208" dur="4.93">we see Reuters they&amp;#39;re gonna be laying</text>
  <text start="210.2" dur="5.009">off about 2,000 people they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="212.93" dur="4.83">to restructure across 39 countries in</text>
  <text start="215.209" dur="4.831">about 150 locations it&amp;#39;s going to affect</text>
  <text start="217.76" dur="5.699">the financial and risk business and the</text>
  <text start="220.04" dur="6.179">enterprise areas of their business we</text>
  <text start="223.459" dur="6.21">see GM right now their sales have</text>
  <text start="226.219" dur="8.341">dropped by 1.7 percent and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="229.669" dur="8.611">offering incredible discounts to try to</text>
  <text start="234.56" dur="6.09">boost their sales and what has been</text>
  <text start="238.28" dur="4.47">happening is that auto sales are</text>
  <text start="240.65" dur="3.839">continually declining and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="242.75" dur="7.949">declined between six and eight percent</text>
  <text start="244.489" dur="9.691">and even with these huge consumer</text>
  <text start="250.699" dur="8.1">discounts they failed to prevent a fall</text>
  <text start="254.18" dur="6.899">off from last year&amp;#39;s record high and we</text>
  <text start="258.799" dur="5.93">can see right now sales are much worse</text>
  <text start="261.079" dur="6.301">than they were last October even with</text>
  <text start="264.729" dur="5.851">the consumer discounts this should tell</text>
  <text start="267.38" dur="7.08">everyone something this tells us that</text>
  <text start="270.58" dur="6.19">the situation here the economy it is not</text>
  <text start="274.46" dur="4.709">improving it&amp;#39;s actually getting worse</text>
  <text start="276.77" dur="5.489">because when we look to a year ago we</text>
  <text start="279.169" dur="4.981">see things have gotten worse actually if</text>
  <text start="282.259" dur="5.931">we look at trucking companies right now</text>
  <text start="284.15" dur="7.079">we realize that this is another problem</text>
  <text start="288.19" dur="5.44">we&amp;#39;re seeing a collapse of the class 8</text>
  <text start="291.229" dur="5.011">truck orders for the month of September</text>
  <text start="293.63" dur="5.37">net class 8 orders were down about 16</text>
  <text start="296.24" dur="5.519">percent year-on-year and we see right</text>
  <text start="299" dur="6.96">now that these net orders they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="301.759" dur="6.181">lowest since January of 2011 with</text>
  <text start="305.96" dur="5.66">year-on-year changes now in the negative</text>
  <text start="307.94" dur="5.55">territory for 19 consecutive months and</text>
  <text start="311.62" dur="2.229">what they&amp;#39;re saying is that you know</text>
  <text start="313.49" dur="3.269">there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="313.849" dur="5.671">capacity this is what has driven the</text>
  <text start="316.759" dur="5.821">pricing down they don&amp;#39;t need the trucks</text>
  <text start="319.52" dur="7.59">and the reason for this is because</text>
  <text start="322.58" dur="6.66">there&amp;#39;s weak consumer good imports most</text>
  <text start="327.11" dur="5.099">consumer goods are imported they need to</text>
  <text start="329.24" dur="3.389">be shipped around the country and guess</text>
  <text start="332.209" dur="3.39">what</text>
  <text start="332.629" dur="5.91">since the consumers aren&amp;#39;t demanding the</text>
  <text start="335.599" dur="5.58">goods nothing needs to be moved around</text>
  <text start="338.539" dur="6.53">and this is why we see retail</text>
  <text start="341.179" dur="7.651">contracting manufacturing contracting</text>
  <text start="345.069" dur="6.671">this is why we see trucks declining rail</text>
  <text start="348.83" dur="4.739">traffic declining I mean it all starts</text>
  <text start="351.74" dur="4.199">to make sense when you start to put</text>
  <text start="353.569" dur="4.02">everything together and with the</text>
  <text start="355.939" dur="3.74">corporate media and what the government</text>
  <text start="357.589" dur="5.82">and the central bank is telling us that</text>
  <text start="359.679" dur="5.86">doesn&amp;#39;t seem so realistic anymore</text>
  <text start="363.409" dur="4.07">because when we look at what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="365.539" dur="4.321">here we see things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="367.479" dur="6.04">deteriorating when we look at the real</text>
  <text start="369.86" dur="5.729">estate market not just housing but we</text>
  <text start="373.519" dur="5.221">look at renting we see things are</text>
  <text start="375.589" dur="7.31">dramatically changing right now demand</text>
  <text start="378.74" dur="7.169">is drying up in the priciest markets</text>
  <text start="382.899" dur="6.55">among the top ten rental markets we are</text>
  <text start="385.909" dur="6.71">seeing declines in these markets San</text>
  <text start="389.449" dur="6.87">Francisco New York and the trend is</text>
  <text start="392.619" dur="6.82">continuing from last month half of the</text>
  <text start="396.319" dur="6.39">20 precious saw falling rents including</text>
  <text start="399.439" dur="4.77">cities like San Diego Miami Honolulu the</text>
  <text start="402.709" dur="4.02">market for two-bedroom apartment seems</text>
  <text start="404.209" dur="6.81">to be slowing down even faster prices</text>
  <text start="406.729" dur="5.91">have fallen by 60% of rental markets the</text>
  <text start="411.019" dur="6.18">last high rents decline year-over-year</text>
  <text start="412.639" dur="6.63">was back in April of 2010 now this is</text>
  <text start="417.199" dur="3.93">just another indicator letting us know</text>
  <text start="419.269" dur="4.02">that things are rapidly deteriorating</text>
  <text start="421.129" dur="4.8">very very quickly and what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="423.289" dur="5.1">across the nation not just in New York</text>
  <text start="425.929" dur="6.6">but we&amp;#39;re looking in the southern states</text>
  <text start="428.389" dur="6.51">Florida Texas California the Midwest we</text>
  <text start="432.529" dur="5.55">see that these people who are renting</text>
  <text start="434.899" dur="5.67">out these apartments houses or whatever</text>
  <text start="438.079" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;re renting we see that they are now</text>
  <text start="440.569" dur="5.4">giving incentives like come in and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="443.809" dur="3.86">give you the first month free come in</text>
  <text start="445.969" dur="4.981">we&amp;#39;ll give you two months free</text>
  <text start="447.669" dur="5.921">so not just the housing market but the</text>
  <text start="450.95" dur="6.3">rental market is also getting hit right</text>
  <text start="453.59" dur="6.42">now and what we&amp;#39;re starting to see is</text>
  <text start="457.25" dur="6.57">that everything is contracting at the</text>
  <text start="460.01" dur="6.54">same time this is a perfect storm where</text>
  <text start="463.82" dur="6.42">this system is going to rip itself apart</text>
  <text start="466.55" dur="7.56">and there&amp;#39;s nothing they can do to stop</text>
  <text start="470.24" dur="6.179">it yes they can create currency out of</text>
  <text start="474.11" dur="6.93">thin air but it won&amp;#39;t stop the</text>
  <text start="476.419" dur="7.201">underlying economic sectors from</text>
  <text start="481.04" dur="4.65">contracting they can&amp;#39;t do it they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="483.62" dur="4.68">force people to go spend they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="485.69" dur="6.09">force people to get jobs that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="488.3" dur="7.17">exist it just will not work we see us</text>
  <text start="491.78" dur="5.13">construction spending well this is</text>
  <text start="495.47" dur="5.49">contracted year-on-year for the first</text>
  <text start="496.91" dur="6.479">time since 2011 and we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="500.96" dur="5.25">u.s. construction spending decline for</text>
  <text start="503.389" dur="5.071">two consecutive months sliding point</text>
  <text start="506.21" dur="3.36">four percent in October now they thought</text>
  <text start="508.46" dur="4.41">there was going to be a point five</text>
  <text start="509.57" dur="7.62">percent rise but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="512.87" dur="7.289">now is that year-over-year it is</text>
  <text start="517.19" dur="6.75">declined by 0.2% and this is the first</text>
  <text start="520.159" dur="6.361">time since 2011 again this is another</text>
  <text start="523.94" dur="6.57">indicator letting us know that we are</text>
  <text start="526.52" dur="5.49">headed towards major problems now the</text>
  <text start="530.51" dur="3.81">last time u.s. construction spent a</text>
  <text start="532.01" dur="5.49">decline on the annual basis the economy</text>
  <text start="534.32" dur="7.2">entered a recession and when we look at</text>
  <text start="537.5" dur="6.53">this over time and we go back prior to</text>
  <text start="541.52" dur="7.05">2008 we see construction spending</text>
  <text start="544.03" dur="8.05">declining in the years of 2005 going</text>
  <text start="548.57" dur="9.47">into 2006 going into 2007 and then boom</text>
  <text start="552.08" dur="8.19">we went below zero when we hit 2008 and</text>
  <text start="558.04" dur="7.989">we&amp;#39;re seeing the same pattern right now</text>
  <text start="560.27" dur="10.23">I mean if we go back to 2014 into 15</text>
  <text start="566.029" dur="6.68">then go into 2016 we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="570.5" dur="5.209">downward trend I mean we&amp;#39;re at negative</text>
  <text start="572.709" dur="7.561">point two right now</text>
  <text start="575.709" dur="4.561">we&amp;#39;re heading in the same direction</text>
  <text start="580.329" dur="14.12">and since 2011 or so we&amp;#39;ve been bouncing</text>
  <text start="586.509" dur="12.54">around between 5:15 around that area and</text>
  <text start="594.449" dur="8.35">it just started to suddenly drop come</text>
  <text start="599.049" dur="6.66">2015 going into 2016 so we can see the</text>
  <text start="602.799" dur="5.4">situation is not improving whatsoever it</text>
  <text start="605.709" dur="5.37">is getting worse and we&amp;#39;re seeing more</text>
  <text start="608.199" dur="5.31">and more indicators and we mentioned</text>
  <text start="611.079" dur="4.95">about the bond bubble where it is</text>
  <text start="613.509" dur="5.43">bursting and we&amp;#39;re seeing the global</text>
  <text start="616.029" dur="6.72">bonds well they are collapsing the</text>
  <text start="618.939" dur="7.86">German 10-year Bund has seen yield</text>
  <text start="622.749" dur="6.171">spikes out of their downtrend as have</text>
  <text start="626.799" dur="4.35">Japan&amp;#39;s 10-year government bonds</text>
  <text start="628.92" dur="6.359">long-term US Treasuries have taken out</text>
  <text start="631.149" dur="6.81">their trendline as have junk bonds and</text>
  <text start="635.279" dur="8.11">the bond market right now is flashing</text>
  <text start="637.959" dur="8.011">danger danger we see the bond bubble is</text>
  <text start="643.389" dur="6.271">now well over a hundred and trillion</text>
  <text start="645.97" dur="7.199">dollars and a top-off that whole thing</text>
  <text start="649.66" dur="7.19">there&amp;#39;s another 555 trillion in</text>
  <text start="653.169" dur="7.17">derivatives trading based on bond prices</text>
  <text start="656.85" dur="8.409">so when this comes down it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="660.339" dur="8.79">a complete disaster now what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="665.259" dur="6.75">seeing is this entire system ripping</text>
  <text start="669.129" dur="4.86">itself apart and we know the central</text>
  <text start="672.009" dur="4.471">bankers they&amp;#39;ve been planning a</text>
  <text start="673.989" dur="5.01">completely new system it&amp;#39;s been in the</text>
  <text start="676.48" dur="6.199">works for quite a while I&amp;#39;m gonna have a</text>
  <text start="678.999" dur="7.38">whole new currency the existing dollar</text>
  <text start="682.679" dur="6.28">will be devalued now many people say</text>
  <text start="686.379" dur="3.721">it&amp;#39;s going to be the SDR other people</text>
  <text start="688.959" dur="2.19">say it&amp;#39;s going to be something</text>
  <text start="690.1" dur="4.169">completely different they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="691.149" dur="7.141">about crypto currency but we can see at</text>
  <text start="694.269" dur="9.211">this point that those individuals that</text>
  <text start="698.29" dur="8.549">are holding US dollars we know they are</text>
  <text start="703.48" dur="7.529">toxic we know they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="706.839" dur="6.571">devalued and from what Jim well he is</text>
  <text start="711.009" dur="5.52">saying from what Jim records are saying</text>
  <text start="713.41" dur="6.32">these dollars are going to be devalued</text>
  <text start="716.529" dur="6.54">quite a bit and anyone holding them</text>
  <text start="719.73" dur="7.87">they&amp;#39;re going to lose you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="723.069" dur="6.96">lose your wealth and this is why you</text>
  <text start="727.6" dur="5.21">need to prepare accordingly for what is</text>
  <text start="730.029" dur="6.87">about to happen now think about this as</text>
  <text start="732.81" dur="6.85">this entire system rips itself apart</text>
