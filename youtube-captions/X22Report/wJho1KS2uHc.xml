  <text start="161.31" dur="9.879">basically decided we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="164.68" dur="11.07">the funds to spend in retail and we see</text>
  <text start="171.189" dur="6.33">that the spending is a huge decline and</text>
  <text start="175.75" dur="6.239">it is the biggest amount in over six</text>

  <text start="215.439" dur="5.64">three-month low at 52.3 and they were</text>
  <text start="218.739" dur="6.301">predicting right now that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="221.079" dur="6.601">to see a slowdown in this year well</text>
  <text start="225.04" dur="4.409">we&amp;#39;re seeing a slowdown in the UK a slow</text>

  <text start="233.29" dur="4.949">slowdown in the United States where is</text>
  <text start="235.51" dur="6.589">all this leading this is leading to the</text>
  <text start="238.239" dur="6">major collapse of the entire system and</text>
  <text start="242.099" dur="5.86">we are definitely headed in that</text>
  <text start="244.239" dur="6.9">direction Italy we understand that their</text>
  <text start="247.959" dur="6.9">banks are in trouble they have a 200</text>
  <text start="251.139" dur="7.081">billion euro bad loan time bomb right</text>
  <text start="254.859" dur="6.231">now and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="258.22" dur="6.84">this and we know this as of january</text>
  <text start="261.09" dur="8.77">january first of 2016 the bail and</text>
  <text start="265.06" dur="8.729">documents they went live and italy</text>
  <text start="269.86" dur="8.52">purposely waited for the rules to come</text>
  <text start="273.789" dur="7.47">into effect on january first to help the</text>
  <text start="278.38" dur="5.789">banks now their new rules that came into</text>
  <text start="281.259" dur="5.331">effect would have put uninsured</text>
  <text start="284.169" dur="6.691">depositors on the hook for the losses</text>
  <text start="286.59" dur="6.4">the same rules require eight percent of</text>
  <text start="290.86" dur="7.05">the bank&amp;#39;s liabilities to be wiped out</text>
  <text start="292.99" dur="7.02">before public money can be used in short</text>
  <text start="297.91" dur="5.34">creditors at Italy&amp;#39;s banks would need to</text>
  <text start="300.01" dur="7.32">take a hit before the government would</text>
  <text start="303.25" dur="8.16">be allowed to extend state aid and they</text>
  <text start="307.33" dur="6.48">waited purposely for these new rules so</text>
  <text start="311.41" dur="5.01">it looks like Italy is going to be going</text>
  <text start="313.81" dur="6.24">inside the bank and they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="316.42" dur="5.67">doing bail-ins where they take the</text>
  <text start="320.05" dur="5.49">people&amp;#39;s money now we&amp;#39;ve seen this in</text>
  <text start="322.09" dur="5.61">Cyprus Greece is going to have this</text>
  <text start="325.54" dur="5.91">happen and we&amp;#39;re seeing it happening in</text>
  <text start="327.7" dur="7.71">Italy and we can see at this point they</text>
  <text start="331.45" dur="6.6">realize that people are starting to</text>
  <text start="335.41" dur="4.05">catch on that they&amp;#39;re doing balance and</text>
  <text start="338.05" dur="3.84">this is why they want to go to a</text>
  <text start="339.46" dur="4.65">cashless society they don&amp;#39;t want people</text>
  <text start="341.89" dur="4.59">taking their funds out of the banks and</text>
  <text start="344.11" dur="4.29">I would suggest to everyone and this is</text>
  <text start="346.48" dur="4.95">my personal opinion and this is what I</text>
  <text start="348.4" dur="6.9">do i would take funds out of the bank</text>
  <text start="351.43" dur="5.64">keep them around someplace else only</text>
  <text start="355.3" dur="3.51">keep whatever you need in the bank to</text>
  <text start="357.07" dur="6.39">pay bills because you&amp;#39;re not getting any</text>
  <text start="358.81" dur="6.27">interest in there anyhow and if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="363.46" dur="3.35">worried about someone stealing you</text>
  <text start="365.08" dur="4.95">should be worried about the bankers</text>
  <text start="366.81" dur="5.26">stealing your money from the inside then</text>
  <text start="370.03" dur="4.38">someone&amp;#39;s still coming into the bank or</text>
  <text start="372.07" dur="8.46">coming into your home and stealing your</text>
  <text start="374.41" dur="9.509">funds now we see December existing home</text>
  <text start="380.53" dur="7.29">sales they have surged to the most in</text>
  <text start="383.919" dur="6.091">history after November collapsed and we</text>
  <text start="387.82" dur="3.63">see that November collapsed by negative</text>
  <text start="390.01" dur="3.3">ten point five percent and all of a</text>
  <text start="391.45" dur="4.469">sudden december i magically out of</text>
  <text start="393.31" dur="5.25">nowhere they stored by 14 point 7</text>
  <text start="395.919" dur="5.611">percent and if you take the two months</text>
  <text start="398.56" dur="5.01">together was kind of a wash and it looks</text>
  <text start="401.53" dur="3.99">like the year of 2015 was a complete</text>
  <text start="403.57" dur="3.42">disaster in housing but people are</text>
  <text start="405.52" dur="3.24">scratching their heads going how did</text>
  <text start="406.99" dur="5.82">this all of us so how did this happen I</text>
  <text start="408.76" dur="6.06">it makes no sense I mean everything was</text>
  <text start="412.81" dur="5.04">struggling along and then all of a</text>
  <text start="414.82" dur="4.05">sudden everything increased well there</text>
  <text start="417.85" dur="5.12">are certain things that were happening</text>
  <text start="418.87" dur="6.74">at this point and we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text>
  <text start="422.97" dur="6.67">since the you one is being devalued</text>
  <text start="425.61" dur="6.22">multiple times the Chinese right now are</text>
  <text start="429.64" dur="5.04">scrambling to park cash</text>
  <text start="431.83" dur="6.44">in the US and they went on a spending</text>
  <text start="434.68" dur="8.73">spree and they purchased these homes</text>
  <text start="438.27" dur="9.46">using cash and they purchased many of</text>
  <text start="443.41" dur="8.13">them so we can see at this point this is</text>
  <text start="447.73" dur="6.78">not from the American people this is</text>
  <text start="451.54" dur="5.67">from foreign entities this is from the</text>
  <text start="454.51" dur="4.91">free money from the Fed this is from</text>
  <text start="457.21" dur="6.06">hedge funds investment companies</text>
  <text start="459.42" dur="7.66">investing in homes now the Fed is</text>
  <text start="463.27" dur="5.52">telling the banks to keep houses off the</text>
  <text start="467.08" dur="4.32">market I&amp;#39;ve been looking around the</text>
  <text start="468.79" dur="5.16">country and I&amp;#39;ve been noticing and I</text>
  <text start="471.4" dur="4.77">spoke to three realtor&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="473.95" dur="5.01">things are dramatically slowing down and</text>
  <text start="476.17" dur="5.97">it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder to sell</text>

  <text start="488.98" dur="4.26">longer and longer people are lowering</text>

  <text start="514.57" dur="5.81">point and this is where housing is</text>
  <text start="517.63" dur="6">actually heading it&amp;#39;s heading to a</text>

  <text start="676.15" dur="6.84">and kind of slowly secretly getting rid</text>
  <text start="680.32" dur="5.51">of them now it&amp;#39;s very interesting we</text>
  <text start="682.99" dur="7.58">know Saudi Arabia took a very big hit</text>
  <text start="685.83" dur="7.39">because they&amp;#39;re pumping oil like crazy</text>

  <text start="705.89" dur="7.65">money that they have what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="709.49" dur="7.95">though is that Saudi Arabia nobody</text>
  <text start="713.54" dur="7.53">really knows how many Treasuries they</text>
  <text start="717.44" dur="7.53">really have because what we come to find</text>
  <text start="721.07" dur="7.17">out is that there&amp;#39;s two type of rules</text>
  <text start="724.97" dur="5.97">the Treasury has there&amp;#39;s one for Saudi</text>
  <text start="728.24" dur="6.93">Arabia and as another for the rest of</text>
  <text start="730.94" dur="7.83">the countries and what this means is the</text>
  <text start="735.17" dur="6.84">Treasury they have never disclosed the</text>
  <text start="738.77" dur="8.39">holdings of Saudi Arabia the rules are</text>
  <text start="742.01" dur="8.73">completely different now Saudi Arabia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="747.16" dur="6.52">holdings are kept a secret they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="750.74" dur="6.75">protected by an unusual black out by the</text>
  <text start="753.68" dur="6.09">US Treasury Department for more than a</text>
  <text start="757.49" dur="4.35">hundred other countries from China to</text>
  <text start="759.77" dur="4.53">the Vatican the Treasury provides</text>
  <text start="761.84" dur="6.09">detailed breakdown of how much you is</text>
  <text start="764.3" dur="5.85">that each holds but for some reason we</text>
  <text start="767.93" dur="6.42">really don&amp;#39;t know how much Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="770.15" dur="6.87">holds which means if they held a little</text>
  <text start="774.35" dur="5.85">bit it wouldn&amp;#39;t matter if they held a</text>
