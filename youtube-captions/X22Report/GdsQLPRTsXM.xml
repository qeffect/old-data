  <text start="64.98" dur="5.91">is the deep state about to activate the</text>
  <text start="67.92" dur="4.71">sleeper cells let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="70.89" dur="4.26">economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="72.63" dur="5.31">geopolitical news now we can see the</text>
  <text start="75.15" dur="5.16">fisa memo it came out today and we see</text>
  <text start="77.94" dur="4.74">the corporate media&amp;#39;s out there and it</text>
  <text start="80.31" dur="6.57">looks like they&amp;#39;re labeling this a</text>
  <text start="82.68" dur="6.54">conspiracy theory and those individuals</text>
  <text start="86.88" dur="4.17">that believe in the memo well they</text>
  <text start="89.22" dur="3.69">believe in conspiracy theories this is</text>
  <text start="91.05" dur="4.2">how they&amp;#39;re pushing the propaganda they</text>
  <text start="92.91" dur="4.709">want everyone to believe and everyone to</text>
  <text start="95.25" dur="3.96">think that this is a conspiracy this is</text>
  <text start="97.619" dur="4.051">what the CIA created they created this</text>
  <text start="99.21" dur="5.07">term to explain away why these things</text>
  <text start="101.67" dur="5.16">happen pretty much right after JFK got</text>
  <text start="104.28" dur="4.979">shot and we can see that this four page</text>
  <text start="106.83" dur="4.74">memo compiled by the Republican chair of</text>
  <text start="109.259" dur="6.181">the House Intelligence Committee accuses</text>
  <text start="111.57" dur="5.52">the Obama administration the FBI and the</text>
  <text start="115.44" dur="3.27">Department of Justice of securing a</text>
  <text start="117.09" dur="3.9">warrant to spy on the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="118.71" dur="4.95">based on the steal dossier</text>
  <text start="120.99" dur="4.769">now the FISA memo accuses senior</text>
  <text start="123.66" dur="4.53">officials at the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="125.759" dur="5.431">of inappropriately using biased</text>
  <text start="128.19" dur="4.56">opposition research into then-candidate</text>
  <text start="131.19" dur="4.05">Trump to obtained surveillance warrants</text>
  <text start="132.75" dur="4.2">on transition team members as part of</text>
  <text start="135.24" dur="5.16">the federal investigation into the Trump</text>
  <text start="136.95" dur="6.99">campaign and Russia information from the</text>
  <text start="140.4" dur="6.21">so called steel dossier was essential to</text>
  <text start="143.94" dur="5.73">the acquisition of surveillance warrants</text>
  <text start="146.61" dur="6.03">on Trump&amp;#39;s campaign aid quarter page it</text>
  <text start="149.67" dur="4.83">claims that then deputy FBI director</text>
  <text start="152.64" dur="3.569">Andrew McCabe told the committee in</text>
  <text start="154.5" dur="3.959">December that without the information</text>
  <text start="156.209" dur="5.191">from the steel dossier no surveillance</text>
  <text start="158.459" dur="4.681">no surveillance Warren 4-page would have</text>
  <text start="161.4" dur="5.4">been sought now what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="163.14" dur="5.25">about this is that the memo alleges that</text>
  <text start="166.8" dur="5.78">the political origins of the dossier</text>
  <text start="168.39" dur="8.4">paid for by Hillary Clinton and the DNC</text>
  <text start="172.58" dur="7.02">that it was not disclosed to the court</text>
  <text start="176.79" dur="5.91">that signed off on the warrant request</text>
  <text start="179.6" dur="5.169">the document claims that although the</text>
  <text start="182.7" dur="3.599">FBI had clear evidence that the author</text>
  <text start="184.769" dur="2.311">of the dossier former British spy</text>
  <text start="186.299" dur="3.661">Christopher Steele</text>
  <text start="187.08" dur="4.44">was biased against rub it did not convey</text>
  <text start="189.96" dur="4.14">that to the Surveillance Court when</text>
  <text start="191.52" dur="4.47">making its warrant applications Steele</text>
  <text start="194.1" dur="5.07">told then associate that Deputy Attorney</text>
  <text start="195.99" dur="5.31">General Bruce or that he was desperate</text>
  <text start="199.17" dur="3.99">that Donald Trump not get elected and</text>
  <text start="201.3" dur="6.17">was passionate about him not being</text>
  <text start="203.16" dur="10.46">president now once again we can see that</text>
  <text start="207.47" dur="9.37">this is a problem and Andrew McCabe</text>
  <text start="213.62" dur="5.71">confirmed to the committee that no FISA</text>
  <text start="216.84" dur="4.8">warrant would have been sought from the</text>
  <text start="219.33" dur="6.15">FISA Court without the steel dossier</text>
  <text start="221.64" dur="7.23">information that if the the dossier</text>
  <text start="225.48" dur="4.83">didn&amp;#39;t exist at least one of the</text>
  <text start="228.87" dur="5.1">surveillance warrants in the case would</text>
  <text start="230.31" dur="7.77">not have been obtained and this is the</text>
  <text start="233.97" dur="6.06">basis of Mueller&amp;#39;s probe the Department</text>
  <text start="238.08" dur="3.84">of Justice officials knew Steele was</text>
  <text start="240.03" dur="3.66">being paid by Democrats and that</text>
  <text start="241.92" dur="4.74">officials of the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="243.69" dur="7.14">and the FBI signed one warrant and three</text>
  <text start="246.66" dur="7.23">renewals against Carter page so what we</text>
  <text start="250.83" dur="8.31">see right here is that there was a crime</text>
  <text start="253.89" dur="8.4">committed because basically this is no</text>
  <text start="259.14" dur="6.57">different than Watergate that took down</text>
  <text start="262.29" dur="7.32">Nixon here the FBI and the Department of</text>
  <text start="265.71" dur="7.459">Justice used a court by means of fraud</text>
  <text start="269.61" dur="6.63">to accomplish the very same thing as</text>
  <text start="273.169" dur="5.861">what took place in Watergate and it</text>
  <text start="276.24" dur="5.13">explains a lot as to why Comey never</text>
  <text start="279.03" dur="6.42">took notes on the interview with Hillary</text>
  <text start="281.37" dur="6.36">now Judicial Watch they released a 42</text>
  <text start="285.45" dur="4.469">page of heavily redacted State</text>
  <text start="287.73" dur="4.62">Department documents to obtain through</text>
  <text start="289.919" dur="5.521">the Freedom of Information Act which</text>
  <text start="292.35" dur="4.89">reveal that the Obama State Department</text>
  <text start="295.44" dur="5.039">provided senator ben cardin</text>
  <text start="297.24" dur="6.15">a dossier of classified information on</text>
  <text start="300.479" dur="5.461">Russia in order to undermine president</text>
  <text start="303.39" dur="4.92">Trump and this is according to Judicial</text>
  <text start="305.94" dur="4.11">Watch President Tom fintan these</text>
  <text start="308.31" dur="4.2">documents show the Obama State</text>
  <text start="310.05" dur="5.58">Department under John Kerry gathered and</text>
  <text start="312.51" dur="5.37">sent its own dossier of classified</text>
  <text start="315.63" dur="4.89">information on Russia to senator ben</text>
  <text start="317.88" dur="3">cardin a political ally in the US Senate</text>
  <text start="320.52" dur="2.85">to on</text>
  <text start="320.88" dur="5.19">mine President Trump now if we go back</text>
  <text start="323.37" dur="6.33">in time here we can see that Evelyn</text>
  <text start="326.07" dur="4.89">Farkas who was the Obama Deputy</text>
  <text start="329.7" dur="3.78">Assistant Secretary of Defense</text>
  <text start="330.96" dur="4.86">she made some stunning admissions back</text>
  <text start="333.48" dur="4.62">in March of 2017 when she was</text>
  <text start="335.82" dur="6">interviewed on MSNBC&amp;#39;s Mika Brzezinski</text>
  <text start="338.1" dur="6.24">show while discussing the mad scramble</text>
  <text start="341.82" dur="5.49">by the Obama administration to collect</text>
  <text start="344.34" dur="4.62">and preserve intelligence on alleged</text>
  <text start="347.31" dur="4.7">Russian election hacking before Obama</text>
  <text start="348.96" dur="5.52">left office it appears that Farkas</text>
  <text start="352.01" dur="4.93">accidentally implicated the Obama White</text>
  <text start="354.48" dur="5.79">House in their surveillance of Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="356.94" dur="5.85">campaign staff she said if they found</text>
  <text start="360.27" dur="4.89">out how we knew what we knew about the</text>
  <text start="362.79" dur="4.77">Trump staff dealing with Russians that</text>
  <text start="365.16" dur="5.01">they would try to compromise those</text>
  <text start="367.56" dur="5.37">sources and methods meaning we would no</text>
  <text start="370.17" dur="5.82">longer have access to the that</text>
  <text start="372.93" dur="6.09">intelligence so what she&amp;#39;s really saying</text>
  <text start="375.99" dur="5.07">is they were doing a mop-up operation</text>
  <text start="379.02" dur="4.38">cleaning up all the documentation</text>
  <text start="381.06" dur="4.29">getting rid of all those things that</text>
  <text start="383.4" dur="4.47">showed that yes they were spying on</text>
  <text start="385.35" dur="6.12">Trump illegally and they needed to make</text>
  <text start="387.87" dur="6.24">sure that this wasn&amp;#39;t out there but it</text>
  <text start="391.47" dur="3.75">looks like it is all backfiring right</text>
  <text start="394.11" dur="3.39">now of course the corporate media</text>
  <text start="395.22" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re trying to play this bit down big</text>
  <text start="397.5" dur="3.84">time they&amp;#39;re using emotion the using</text>
  <text start="399.81" dur="3.21">conspiracy theory they&amp;#39;re using whatever</text>
  <text start="401.34" dur="7.32">they possibly can John McCain is out</text>
  <text start="403.02" dur="8.76">there and he is saying that listen this</text>
  <text start="408.66" dur="5.43">does not help the US doesn&amp;#39;t help the</text>
  <text start="411.78" dur="5.61">parties it doesn&amp;#39;t help the president it</text>
  <text start="414.09" dur="5.82">only helps Putin the Russians now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="417.39" dur="5.66">going back that yes this is all part of</text>
  <text start="419.91" dur="5.73">Putin&amp;#39;s plan this is ridiculous</text>
  <text start="423.05" dur="5.38">these are individuals and it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="425.64" dur="5.31">Democrats as Republicans they&amp;#39;re all in</text>
  <text start="428.43" dur="3.69">on this and there are certain</text>
  <text start="430.95" dur="2.49">individuals that are bad and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="432.12" dur="3.39">certain individuals that are good and</text>
  <text start="433.44" dur="5.7">there&amp;#39;s a lot of corruption in</text>
  <text start="435.51" dur="6.33">government we all know this but we can</text>
  <text start="439.14" dur="6.33">see that ex CIA Chiefs Panetta he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="441.84" dur="5.73">warning that if this memo came out we</text>
  <text start="445.47" dur="3.63">would have a constitutional crisis it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="447.57" dur="3.63">amazing all these warnings that are</text>
  <text start="449.1" dur="5.039">coming out that these individuals are in</text>
  <text start="451.2" dur="5.67">trouble the spotlight is on them they</text>
  <text start="454.139" dur="5.61">did something wrong they they handed a</text>
  <text start="456.87" dur="5.009">fake dossier to the court which they</text>
  <text start="459.749" dur="4.29">knew it was fake and they try to get a</text>
  <text start="461.879" dur="4.141">warrant which they did get and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="464.039" dur="4.291">trying to make it seem like everything</text>
  <text start="466.02" dur="4.229">else and everyone else is crazy except</text>
  <text start="468.33" dur="4.589">them I mean think about what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="470.249" dur="4.35">doing right now it&amp;#39;s unbelievable but</text>

  <text start="474.599" dur="5.551">and they&amp;#39;re gonna try to push it as hard</text>
  <text start="476.699" dur="6.481">as they possibly can until documentation</text>
  <text start="480.15" dur="4.68">comes out which shows certain facts and</text>
  <text start="483.18" dur="4.47">remember this is the beginning stages</text>

  <text start="679.47" dur="6.03">evidence of this as of yet because what</text>
