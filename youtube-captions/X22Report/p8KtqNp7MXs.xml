  <text start="216.48" dur="5.93">their agenda and now they produced a</text>
  <text start="218.97" dur="6.99">poll to show what people believe and</text>
  <text start="222.41" dur="6.07">they believe a recession is coming and</text>
  <text start="225.96" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re agreeing with what the</text>
  <text start="228.48" dur="4.86">mainstream media is saying think about</text>

  <text start="260.489" dur="5.841">media&amp;#39;s news reports and by doing this</text>
  <text start="264.12" dur="5.07">they hope that people will follow along</text>
  <text start="266.33" dur="5.23">that the sheep will be herded in a</text>
  <text start="269.19" dur="4.47">certain direction but we need to</text>
  <text start="271.56" dur="3.3">remember something very important the</text>
  <text start="273.66" dur="4.2">mainstream media the deep state</text>
  <text start="274.86" dur="5.82">essential bank they&amp;#39;re fighting against</text>
  <text start="277.86" dur="4.41">their own brainwashing for years they</text>

  <text start="301.229" dur="4.711">and they&amp;#39;re using their credit card and</text>
  <text start="303.6" dur="4.83">accumulating more debt that&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="305.94" dur="6.509">thing I mean go back to the holiday</text>
  <text start="308.43" dur="7.35">season when they report how retail is</text>
  <text start="312.449" dur="6.121">doing what do they use they use the</text>
  <text start="315.78" dur="4.59">credit card statistical numbers to let</text>
  <text start="318.57" dur="3.72">everyone know that everyone is using</text>

  <text start="324.63" dur="5.58">show that look everything is great now</text>
  <text start="327.66" dur="4.77">during the Obama administration they</text>

  <text start="341.19" dur="5.789">the funds to pay for the items that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="345.93" dur="3.65">what that really means</text>
  <text start="346.979" dur="6.121">but Trump of the Patriots they know this</text>
  <text start="349.58" dur="5.44">they know if people feel good about the</text>
  <text start="353.1" dur="4.5">economy if people believe that the</text>
  <text start="355.02" dur="6.09">economy&amp;#39;s doing well they will go out</text>
  <text start="357.6" dur="7.05">and spend and that&amp;#39;s exactly what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="361.11" dur="4.71">seeing even with these poll numbers even</text>
  <text start="364.65" dur="4.46">with the mainstream media out there</text>
  <text start="365.82" dur="6.3">telling you that the economy is</text>
  <text start="369.11" dur="5.59">weakening the economy looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="372.12" dur="3.72">going into recession the Fed can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="374.7" dur="3.27">anything to stop it</text>
  <text start="375.84" dur="4.77">which is fake phony and false what are</text>
  <text start="377.97" dur="5.64">people doing they&amp;#39;re out there spending</text>
  <text start="380.61" dur="5.73">their money now think about this for a</text>
  <text start="383.61" dur="6.36">second if the interest rates come down</text>
  <text start="386.34" dur="8.94">and stimulus has started this will open</text>
  <text start="389.97" dur="7.379">the entire market to new people and what</text>
  <text start="395.28" dur="3.48">do I mean by this well if we take the</text>
  <text start="397.349" dur="3.711">housing market for instance and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="398.76" dur="5.82">talked about this many many times before</text>
  <text start="401.06" dur="5.59">this trick has been used to pump up the</text>
  <text start="404.58" dur="4.769">bubbles Trump and the Patriots know this</text>
  <text start="406.65" dur="6.3">if you lower the interest rates guess</text>
  <text start="409.349" dur="6.181">what you have more purchasing power to</text>
  <text start="412.95" dur="5.61">purchase a home you can even get a</text>
  <text start="415.53" dur="4.71">better home same thing with an</text>
  <text start="418.56" dur="4.62">automobile same thing with student loans</text>
  <text start="420.24" dur="5.16">you have the ability to go back to</text>
  <text start="423.18" dur="5.19">college you have the ability to purchase</text>
  <text start="425.4" dur="5.91">car businesses have the ability to</text>
  <text start="428.37" dur="5.13">refinance at a much lower rate to buy</text>
  <text start="431.31" dur="5.91">back their stocks to keep the system</text>
  <text start="433.5" dur="6.99">going and what happens if the rates go</text>
  <text start="437.22" dur="5.28">up the opposite happens people are</text>
  <text start="440.49" dur="4.29">bumped out of the housing market people</text>
  <text start="442.5" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t want to buy cars right now people</text>
  <text start="444.78" dur="3.29">don&amp;#39;t want to go back to school because</text>
  <text start="446.16" dur="5.099">the rates are too high</text>
  <text start="448.07" dur="6.25">businesses guess what they&amp;#39;re struggling</text>
  <text start="451.259" dur="6.151">their interest rates on their debt it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="454.32" dur="6.12">it moves up they have to pay more they</text>
  <text start="457.41" dur="4.009">struggle and it doesn&amp;#39;t work out for</text>
  <text start="460.44" dur="4.92">them</text>
  <text start="461.419" dur="5.891">Trump Patriots they know this the</text>
  <text start="465.36" dur="3.42">mainstream media knows this but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="467.31" dur="3.75">trying to spin this because this is all</text>
  <text start="468.78" dur="7.58">they have but it&amp;#39;s already failed</text>
  <text start="471.06" dur="9.359">because the people actually feel good</text>
  <text start="476.36" dur="7.119">the people believe what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="480.419" dur="5.731">told all along about the stock market</text>
  <text start="483.479" dur="4.951">the unemployment and all the statistical</text>
  <text start="486.15" dur="4.47">numbers that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="488.43" dur="5.519">listening to and Trump in the Patriots</text>
  <text start="490.62" dur="4.919">they&amp;#39;re using all of this against the</text>
  <text start="493.949" dur="4.711">central bank the mainstream media the</text>
  <text start="495.539" dur="6.421">deep state everything that they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="498.66" dur="5.58">in the past it&amp;#39;s like a boomerang and</text>
  <text start="501.96" dur="5.639">they&amp;#39;re getting hit with it and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="504.24" dur="5.7">nothing they can do you know out of</text>
  <text start="507.599" dur="5.641">Bloomberg it was an article that said</text>
  <text start="509.94" dur="6.3">yes the Fed could still stop a recession</text>
  <text start="513.24" dur="5.64">and out of CNBC we also have someone</text>
  <text start="516.24" dur="6.06">saying listen if the Fed lowers rates</text>
  <text start="518.88" dur="7.11">and it&amp;#39;s a big enough drop guess what</text>
  <text start="522.3" dur="7.53">this economy can keep going so just with</text>
  <text start="525.99" dur="6.23">that that means that Trump and the</text>
  <text start="529.83" dur="7.41">Patriots they&amp;#39;re on the right path and</text>
  <text start="532.22" dur="6.63">we know the agenda of the deep State the</text>
  <text start="537.24" dur="4.8">central bank and the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="538.85" dur="7.33">now like we said Trump is going to</text>
  <text start="542.04" dur="6.36">continually hit at the Fed very very</text>
  <text start="546.18" dur="5.04">hard every single time he&amp;#39;s not gonna</text>
  <text start="548.4" dur="6.3">stop he&amp;#39;s going to accelerate it until</text>
  <text start="551.22" dur="5.82">he gets the rate cuts until he gets the</text>
  <text start="554.7" dur="3.51">stimulus and then guess what he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="557.04" dur="3.33">on another rate cut</text>
  <text start="558.21" dur="4.71">and he&amp;#39;s gonna want more stimulus Trump</text>
  <text start="560.37" dur="4.8">tweeted out the following the economy is</text>
  <text start="562.92" dur="5.49">doing great with tremendous upside</text>
  <text start="565.17" dur="8.4">potential if the Fed would do what they</text>
  <text start="568.41" dur="7.83">should we are a rocket upward and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="573.57" dur="5.67">absolutely right he&amp;#39;s laying it out for</text>
  <text start="576.24" dur="7.32">the people letting everyone know if the</text>
  <text start="579.24" dur="6.24">Fed does what I say the economy is going</text>
  <text start="583.56" dur="6.15">to take off it&amp;#39;s going to be like a</text>

  <text start="603.21" dur="5.55">up if there is another rate cut what do</text>
  <text start="606.3" dur="5.82">you think is going to happen it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="608.76" dur="4.89">move up even more and we know that Trump</text>

  <text start="637.23" dur="7.35">this every time Trump tweets out about</text>
  <text start="641.01" dur="7.05">the Fed he&amp;#39;s building the narrative to</text>
  <text start="644.58" dur="7.98">take them down that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="648.06" dur="6.81">to see next he&amp;#39;s continually building</text>
  <text start="652.56" dur="3.9">the narrative it&amp;#39;s not just that he just</text>
  <text start="654.87" dur="3.68">wants to cut the rate cuts that he just</text>
  <text start="656.46" dur="4.86">wants stimulus yes that&amp;#39;s very important</text>
