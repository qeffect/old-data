  <text start="130.42" dur="3.33">spread and get worse he added that the</text>
  <text start="132.25" dur="3.78">greater crisis that will merge in the</text>
  <text start="133.75" dur="4.83">eurozone is not about liquidity but</text>
  <text start="136.03" dur="5.58">about competitiveness among countries</text>
  <text start="138.58" dur="4.68">and large economic divergences which</text>
  <text start="141.61" dur="4.44">will lead to political fragmentation</text>
  <text start="143.26" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;re already seeing this we know the</text>
  <text start="146.05" dur="4.5">eurozone is not doing as well as</text>
  <text start="148.39" dur="3.63">everyone wants to believe we know</text>

  <text start="152.02" dur="4.65">know they&amp;#39;re creating money and</text>
  <text start="154.05" dur="6.219">everything is really starting to ramp up</text>
  <text start="156.67" dur="5.879">now and this is exactly what the central</text>
  <text start="160.269" dur="4.321">bankers want they want you to believe</text>
  <text start="162.549" dur="5.131">that everything is fun</text>
  <text start="164.59" dur="5.82">mine they want you to believe that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="167.68" dur="7.199">in a recovery this is there meme for the</text>
  <text start="170.41" dur="7.109">entire period since 2008 look we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="174.879" dur="5.61">improving look unemployment&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="177.519" dur="5.58">better but has it really over time since</text>
  <text start="180.489" dur="5.371">2008 no it really hasn&amp;#39;t have they</text>
  <text start="183.099" dur="5.101">manipulated numbers yes they have to</text>
  <text start="185.86" dur="5.97">make it look that way here in the United</text>
  <text start="188.2" dur="7.319">States the illusion is being pushed as</text>
  <text start="191.83" dur="6.57">hard as they possibly can to continually</text>
  <text start="195.519" dur="5.55">make you believe we have recovered</text>
  <text start="198.4" dur="4.949">completely this is part of their plan</text>
  <text start="201.069" dur="5.491">remember they don&amp;#39;t want to be blamed</text>
  <text start="203.349" dur="9.061">for what is coming and right now</text>
  <text start="206.56" dur="11.179">Millennials the those young adults ages</text>
  <text start="212.41" dur="9.27">18 to 34 they do not have savings today</text>
  <text start="217.739" dur="8.411">they have under one thousand dollars in</text>
  <text start="221.68" dur="8.63">savings I mean this is just unbelievable</text>
  <text start="226.15" dur="7.02">and a lot and a lot of this is because</text>
  <text start="230.31" dur="6.1">it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder to find</text>
  <text start="233.17" dur="8.52">jobs and the jobs they are finding their</text>
  <text start="236.41" dur="8.25">low-paying jobs and right now the</text>
  <text start="241.69" dur="5.97">Millennials are projected to about 70</text>
  <text start="244.66" dur="5.189">5.3 million 4 2015 surpassing the</text>
  <text start="247.66" dur="4.949">projected 70 4.9 million for baby</text>
  <text start="249.849" dur="4.831">boomers the Millennials will therefore</text>
  <text start="252.609" dur="4.44">comprise a greater percentage of the</text>
  <text start="254.68" dur="6.809">population than baby boomers for the</text>
  <text start="257.049" dur="8.971">first time so when they did their survey</text>
  <text start="261.489" dur="5.941">they looked at 2585 people and the</text>
  <text start="266.02" dur="3.6">results of the survey found that over</text>
  <text start="267.43" dur="6.359">fifty percent of Millennials have less</text>
  <text start="269.62" dur="9.269">than a thousand dollars in savings they</text>
  <text start="273.789" dur="6.511">don&amp;#39;t have enough for an emergency 51.8</text>
  <text start="278.889" dur="3.241">percent of Millennials that have less</text>
  <text start="280.3" dur="3.869">than a thousand eighteen percent of</text>
  <text start="282.13" dur="5.94">Millennials have savings of a thousand</text>
  <text start="284.169" dur="6.661">to five thousand 7.3 have a savings of</text>
  <text start="288.07" dur="5.07">five thousand the ten thousand six point</text>
  <text start="290.83" dur="7.139">four percent have a savings of 10,000 to</text>
  <text start="293.14" dur="7.739">20,000 since Millennials are growing at</text>
  <text start="297.969" dur="5.19">a huge percentage of the population</text>
  <text start="300.879" dur="4.8">their savings and spending habits will</text>
  <text start="303.159" dur="5.46">increasingly have a major impact on the</text>
  <text start="305.679" dur="7.91">overall economy and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="308.619" dur="8.88">right now is that these young adults</text>
  <text start="313.589" dur="6.22">they can&amp;#39;t find the work they can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="317.499" dur="7.62">the high-paying jobs and this is why</text>
  <text start="319.809" dur="8.19">we&amp;#39;re seeing such a big problem and this</text>
  <text start="325.119" dur="5.52">is not just going to go away we have to</text>
  <text start="327.999" dur="5.31">understand that a lot of these jobs are</text>
  <text start="330.639" dur="6.18">being shipped off overseas a lot of</text>
  <text start="333.309" dur="6.36">these jobs no longer exist in the United</text>
  <text start="336.819" dur="5.76">States and the way companies and are</text>
  <text start="339.669" dur="5.31">laying off right now it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="342.579" dur="5.97">harder and harder for these young adults</text>
  <text start="344.979" dur="6">to find jobs and the housing market is</text>
  <text start="348.549" dur="4.29">going to be affected by this because if</text>
  <text start="350.979" dur="4.29">they only have a thousand dollars in</text>
  <text start="352.839" dur="5.34">savings how are they going to buy a</text>
  <text start="355.269" dur="5.58">house it&amp;#39;s impossible this is why they</text>
  <text start="358.179" dur="5.31">have zero percent down this is why you</text>
  <text start="360.849" dur="5.55">can bring people in and hopefully get a</text>
  <text start="363.489" dur="7.23">house using other people that live with</text>
  <text start="366.399" dur="6.42">you but all of a sudden today housing</text>
  <text start="370.719" dur="5.76">starts rose by ten point five percent</text>
  <text start="372.819" dur="6.78">after they plunged last month at a rate</text>
  <text start="376.479" dur="4.83">of twelve percent building permits rose</text>
  <text start="379.599" dur="5.4">eleven percent but when we look closely</text>
  <text start="381.309" dur="8.94">at this we&amp;#39;re seeing that it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="384.999" dur="7.26">coming from the single-family homes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="390.249" dur="4.89">coming from the multi-family home so</text>
  <text start="392.259" dur="6.24">what this tells us is that the hedge</text>
  <text start="395.139" dur="9.6">fund the investment companies received</text>
  <text start="398.499" dur="9.41">orals of free money from the Fed to</text>
  <text start="404.739" dur="7.23">gobble up and start production of</text>
  <text start="407.909" dur="5.89">multi-family houses to rent this is what</text>
  <text start="411.969" dur="3.8">they&amp;#39;ve been doing for a long time this</text>
  <text start="413.799" dur="6">is why we see these ups and downs</text>
  <text start="415.769" dur="6.88">because what happens is the people here</text>
  <text start="419.799" dur="5.19">in the United States the Millennials</text>
  <text start="422.649" dur="7.29">they are not supporting the housing</text>
  <text start="424.989" dur="6.391">industry it is the central bank and what</text>
  <text start="429.939" dur="3.451">they do is they push out my</text>
  <text start="431.38" dur="4.08">they tell them to go out and get it get</text>
  <text start="433.39" dur="3.84">what they can and the number gets pumped</text>
  <text start="435.46" dur="3.42">up then they let it go and they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="437.23" dur="4.95">of a sudden it falls right back to where</text>
  <text start="438.88" dur="7.02">it was we see that mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="442.18" dur="6.21">have declined once again they are not</text>
  <text start="445.9" dur="6.63">improving and this shows you that the</text>
  <text start="448.39" dur="6.63">people of the United States they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="452.53" dur="6.27">helping this economy they&amp;#39;re sitting on</text>
  <text start="455.02" dur="7.11">the sidelines manufacturing PMI has</text>
  <text start="458.8" dur="6.21">plunged to the lowest since 2012 factory</text>
  <text start="462.13" dur="7.05">orders have completely collapsed back to</text>
  <text start="465.01" dur="7.35">2009 Lowe&amp;#39;s markets manufacturing PMI is</text>
  <text start="469.18" dur="7.11">at 51.3 it is the lowest since October</text>
  <text start="472.36" dur="8.46">2012 I mean what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="476.29" dur="6.39">is a complete disaster scenario of the</text>
  <text start="480.82" dur="6.81">manufacturing industry industrial</text>
  <text start="482.68" dur="7.89">production crashes most since 2009 for</text>
  <text start="487.63" dur="4.26">the third month in a row us industrial</text>
  <text start="490.57" dur="6.69">production dropped month-on-month</text>
  <text start="491.89" dur="8.04">crashing point six percent this is the</text>
  <text start="497.26" dur="4.95">first time since 2009 that industrial</text>
  <text start="499.93" dur="4.74">production fell year-on-year by</text>
  <text start="502.21" dur="6.89">one-point-two percent basically it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="504.67" dur="7.28">signaling a major recession / depression</text>
  <text start="509.1" dur="5.47">capacity utilization fell by</text>
  <text start="511.95" dur="5.769">seventy-seven percent the lowest since</text>
  <text start="514.57" dur="5.399">january of 2014 and of course back then</text>
  <text start="517.719" dur="4.681">it was blamed on the cold weather so how</text>
  <text start="519.969" dur="5.431">do they explain it right now who are you</text>
  <text start="522.4" dur="4.95">we&amp;#39;re not seeing frigid cold weathers</text>
  <text start="525.4" dur="6">right now we&amp;#39;re not seeing snow right</text>
  <text start="527.35" dur="7.47">now in the 35 years there&amp;#39;s not had</text>
  <text start="531.4" dur="8.28">there has not been a drop in industrial</text>
  <text start="534.82" dur="7.2">production without a recession so if the</text>
  <text start="539.68" dur="5.64">weather was to blame for November let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="542.02" dur="5.34">say as it was for January what happened</text>
  <text start="545.32" dur="4.68">to all the other months march april may</text>
  <text start="547.36" dur="4.56">june september-october because the</text>
  <text start="550" dur="4.62">weather was very nice in those months</text>
  <text start="551.92" dur="4.88">and this is why we know this weather</text>
  <text start="554.62" dur="7.65">story that they keep throwing at us is</text>
  <text start="556.8" dur="8.61">again fake phony and false to add to all</text>
  <text start="562.27" dur="11.22">of this the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="565.41" dur="13.02">tumbled to 471 the lowest level in the</text>
  <text start="573.49" dur="9.289">last 30 years this is the worst ever and</text>
  <text start="578.43" dur="6.339">this is an economy that&amp;#39;s improving</text>
  <text start="582.779" dur="6.31">seems like the opposite is happening</text>
  <text start="584.769" dur="7.951">right now but don&amp;#39;t worry the Fed has</text>
  <text start="589.089" dur="7.591">come in and they have announced they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="592.72" dur="9.09">going to raise the federal funds rate by</text>
  <text start="596.68" dur="11.43">point two five percent 2.5% up from zero</text>
  <text start="601.81" dur="8.759">to point two five percent now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="608.11" dur="7.05">also telling us that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="610.569" dur="7.731">raise these federal fund rates four more</text>
  <text start="615.16" dur="6.75">times next year and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="618.3" dur="5.769">next year is an election year remember</text>
  <text start="621.91" dur="4.22">that election year back in two thousand</text>
  <text start="624.069" dur="6.241">eight what happened during that period</text>
  <text start="626.13" dur="6.34">the entire economy fell apart the</text>
  <text start="630.31" dur="4.949">Federal Reserve told us that everything</text>
  <text start="632.47" dur="4.41">was fine we were in her we were actually</text>
  <text start="635.259" dur="4.291">doing very well everything was contained</text>
  <text start="636.88" dur="6.6">there were no problems the economy was</text>
  <text start="639.55" dur="7.55">not declining here we have the Federal</text>
  <text start="643.48" dur="7.62">Reserve telling us that we&amp;#39;ve recovered</text>
  <text start="647.1" dur="6.429">unemployment is at full recovery mode at</text>
  <text start="651.1" dur="4.289">five percent most likely will go down to</text>
  <text start="653.529" dur="4.74">four point nine percent either in</text>
  <text start="655.389" dur="9.38">december or january or maybe even lower</text>
  <text start="658.269" dur="12.8">and at this point they need to convince</text>
  <text start="664.769" dur="10.8">everybody that we are in a recovery now</text>
  <text start="671.069" dur="9.911">let&amp;#39;s look at what happened last time</text>
  <text start="675.569" dur="8.5">back in two thousand eight when the</text>
  <text start="680.98" dur="8">interest rates were a little different</text>
  <text start="684.069" dur="9.901">and the last time the Fed actually</text>
  <text start="688.98" dur="9.85">raised rates we see that the sp500 level</text>
  <text start="693.97" dur="7.92">was at 1273 back then which is some</text>
  <text start="698.83" dur="5.76">770 points below where it is now 10-year</text>
  <text start="701.89" dur="5.73">Treasury yields were nearly 300 BPS</text>
  <text start="704.59" dur="6.84">higher and all the way up to 5.1</text>
  <text start="707.62" dur="6.51">ninety-four percent the euro exchange</text>
  <text start="711.43" dur="7.17">rate with the US dollar was at one point</text>
  <text start="714.13" dur="7.23">to 67 which compares to 1.0 93 now back</text>
  <text start="718.6" dur="4.23">when US housing starts were booming we</text>
  <text start="721.36" dur="5.37">saw a two and a quarter million per</text>
  <text start="722.83" dur="9.26">annum and where are we today US housing</text>
  <text start="726.73" dur="7.35">starts are under 1 million per atom</text>
  <text start="732.09" dur="5.89">central banks have purchased a</text>
  <text start="734.08" dur="9.26">remarkable 12 point four trillion of</text>
  <text start="737.98" dur="8.76">financial assets since Bear Stearns and</text>
  <text start="743.34" dur="5.92">we look at the debt-to-gdp ratio back</text>
  <text start="746.74" dur="8.01">then it was 61 percent then the total</text>
  <text start="749.26" dur="7.8">debt was around eight trillion now total</text>
  <text start="754.75" dur="5.91">debt GDP is a hundred and four percent</text>
  <text start="757.06" dur="7.89">and the u.s. debt is just shy of</text>
  <text start="760.66" dur="9.6">nineteen trillion does this sound like a</text>
  <text start="764.95" dur="9.44">recovery no it looks like everything is</text>
  <text start="770.26" dur="6.18">much worse so why did they do this well</text>
  <text start="774.39" dur="3.58">they knew they couldn&amp;#39;t keep it at zero</text>
  <text start="776.44" dur="4.02">percent because they lose credibility</text>
  <text start="777.97" dur="8.16">they would say okay we&amp;#39;re at five</text>
  <text start="780.46" dur="7.83">percent unemployment full recovery the</text>
  <text start="786.13" dur="5.13">US government and the fetters</text>
  <text start="788.29" dur="5.79">continually told us that the economy</text>
  <text start="791.26" dur="5.61">looks quite strong housing looks good</text>
  <text start="794.08" dur="4.2">retail looks good the president</text>
  <text start="796.87" dur="4.23">continually tells us how great</text>
  <text start="798.28" dur="6.15">everything is and if they didn&amp;#39;t raise</text>
