  <text start="51.05" dur="11.37">out in Greece tsipras proposed a bailout</text>
  <text start="57.43" dur="7.69">solution to the EU and basically the</text>
  <text start="62.42" dur="6.27">plan which we discussed before included</text>
  <text start="65.12" dur="5.58">all those things the people voted no to</text>
  <text start="68.69" dur="4.02">this is what they didn&amp;#39;t want they</text>
  <text start="70.7" dur="4.92">didn&amp;#39;t want austerity they didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="72.71" dur="6.72">cuts they wanted economic growth they</text>
  <text start="75.62" dur="6.179">want stability they want a future but of</text>
  <text start="79.43" dur="3.93">course this is not what they got the</text>
  <text start="81.799" dur="6.18">eurozone leaders they&amp;#39;ve reached an</text>
  <text start="83.36" dur="6.93">agreement over a third three-year</text>
  <text start="87.979" dur="7.531">bailout for a debt-ridden Greece worth</text>
  <text start="90.29" dur="7.11">about 82 to 86 billion euros now tsipras</text>
  <text start="95.51" dur="4.55">is going to take this and he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="97.4" dur="6.33">bring it back to Greece where the</text>
  <text start="100.06" dur="8.02">serezha party is going to vote on this</text>
  <text start="103.73" dur="5.94">and it looks like he needs to gather</text>
  <text start="108.08" dur="4.92">support for this deal because there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="109.67" dur="9.03">lot of government officials saying this</text>
  <text start="113" dur="9.84">is not good what are we doing here there</text>
  <text start="118.7" dur="6">are already Greek lawmakers of the</text>
  <text start="122.84" dur="4.38">governing syriza party that reject the</text>
  <text start="124.7" dur="8.069">bailout agreement between Greece and its</text>
  <text start="127.22" dur="7.56">creditors so we&amp;#39;re looking at the</text>
  <text start="132.769" dur="5.731">situation right now and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="134.78" dur="7.86">that this plan that came back from the</text>
  <text start="138.5" dur="7.769">Eurogroup does not look good basically</text>
  <text start="142.64" dur="8.64">what they&amp;#39;re doing here is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="146.269" dur="6.69">taking over the country I mean tsipras</text>
  <text start="151.28" dur="6.15">was out there and he released a</text>
  <text start="152.959" dur="8.76">statement to the Greek people and he</text>
  <text start="157.43" dur="5.61">said we have been fighting hard for six</text>
  <text start="161.719" dur="4.5">months now</text>
  <text start="163.04" dur="6">and we fought until the end to achieve</text>
  <text start="166.219" dur="5.22">the best possible outcome an agreement</text>
  <text start="169.04" dur="4.83">that will enable the country to get back</text>
  <text start="171.439" dur="4.981">on its feet and for the Greek people to</text>
  <text start="173.87" dur="4.229">be able to continue to fight now really</text>
  <text start="176.42" dur="4.28">is this the best deal that can come up</text>
  <text start="178.099" dur="7.11">with does this really help the people</text>
  <text start="180.7" dur="8.23">i&amp;#39;m sorry to say no it does not we are</text>
  <text start="185.209" dur="7.801">seeing the same thing that we saw in the</text>
  <text start="188.93" dur="7.02">last couple of bailouts it is not going</text>
  <text start="193.01" dur="5.67">to help the people whatsoever it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="195.95" dur="6.33">to put grease further and further into</text>
  <text start="198.68" dur="6.72">debt and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that the</text>
  <text start="202.28" dur="7.47">banks are still closed right now they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="205.4" dur="6.72">be closed until Thursday lot longer than</text>
  <text start="209.75" dur="4.169">they said or it could go longer than</text>
  <text start="212.12" dur="4.259">that we don&amp;#39;t know at this point in time</text>
  <text start="213.919" dur="6.031">but we&amp;#39;re seeing other financial</text>
  <text start="216.379" dur="5.97">institutions like Barclays they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="219.95" dur="4.86">there saying the country&amp;#39;s banks which</text>
  <text start="222.349" dur="5.07">were on the verge of collapse would need</text>
  <text start="224.81" dur="4.829">to be recapitalised and according to one</text>
  <text start="227.419" dur="4.38">banking official said that the cost of</text>
  <text start="229.639" dur="4.68">that recap would be somewhere in the</text>
  <text start="231.799" dur="5.43">neighborhood of about 14 billion euros</text>
  <text start="234.319" dur="5.401">but even if Greece does manage to secure</text>
  <text start="237.229" dur="5.37">a new bailout this week which includes</text>
  <text start="239.72" dur="6.269">the 25 billion euros in recap funding</text>
  <text start="242.599" dur="5.79">via the agreed-upon escrow fund the</text>
  <text start="245.989" dur="4.89">banks are by no means out of the woods</text>
  <text start="248.389" dur="5.28">with depositors continue drawing their</text>
  <text start="250.879" dur="7.29">funds even though it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a limit</text>
  <text start="253.669" dur="7.41">of about 60 euros per day Greek banks</text>
  <text start="258.169" dur="6.831">liquidity needs have reached a level</text>
  <text start="261.079" dur="7.861">very close to the current ela ceiling</text>
  <text start="265" dur="5.86">basically the banks are insolvent and we</text>
  <text start="268.94" dur="5.52">can see at this point in time that yeah</text>
  <text start="270.86" dur="6.96">they might have to impose capital</text>
  <text start="274.46" dur="5.13">controls and this might last a much</text>
  <text start="277.82" dur="5.939">longer time that everyone has been</text>
  <text start="279.59" dur="9.09">talking about and we see right now there</text>
  <text start="283.759" dur="10.02">are still balance on the table they</text>
  <text start="288.68" dur="7.53">haven&amp;#39;t removed that whatsoever now we</text>
  <text start="293.779" dur="3.151">can see that tsipras is trying to</text>
  <text start="296.21" dur="3.15">convince</text>
  <text start="296.93" dur="4.89">the people trying to convince the</text>
  <text start="299.36" dur="5.82">government officials that everything is</text>
  <text start="301.82" dur="6.15">fine this is what you wanted but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="305.18" dur="4.95">completely the opposite of what the</text>
  <text start="307.97" dur="4.919">people wanted and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="310.13" dur="6.78">that from a leaked document that this</text>
  <text start="312.889" dur="8.941">plan calls for privatization selling off</text>
  <text start="316.91" dur="9.44">bits and pieces of the country they can</text>
  <text start="321.83" dur="8.399">be selling off airports airplanes</text>
  <text start="326.35" dur="6.909">infrastructure and of course banks they</text>
  <text start="330.229" dur="8.431">will take those funds and they will use</text>
  <text start="333.259" dur="7.44">it to pay back the bankers so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="338.66" dur="4.86">going to be selling this off most likely</text>
  <text start="340.699" dur="5.521">to other central bankers or other</text>
  <text start="343.52" dur="5.01">corporations they will take this money</text>
  <text start="346.22" dur="5.759">that they receive and they will use it</text>
  <text start="348.53" dur="8.31">to pay off their loans basically they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="351.979" dur="8.101">slicing up grease right now and we can</text>
  <text start="356.84" dur="7.35">see at this point in time does this help</text>
  <text start="360.08" dur="7.019">the people no it doesn&amp;#39;t because the</text>
  <text start="364.19" dur="4.89">proceeds are going to go to the</text>
  <text start="367.099" dur="4.621">insolvent banks to the central bankers</text>
  <text start="369.08" dur="5.369">and what is going to go to the people</text>
  <text start="371.72" dur="5.55">nothing so they lose parts of their</text>
  <text start="374.449" dur="5.611">country it&amp;#39;s being sold off this</text>
  <text start="377.27" dur="6.869">completely bypasses them there is no</text>
  <text start="380.06" dur="7.88">economic growth there is no help that</text>
  <text start="384.139" dur="8.161">people are exactly where they started</text>
  <text start="387.94" dur="8.409">they have still no jobs unemployment is</text>
  <text start="392.3" dur="6.45">continually going up we see the youth</text>
  <text start="396.349" dur="4.5">unemployment very very high and that</text>
  <text start="398.75" dur="7.349">means the next generation is going to be</text>
  <text start="400.849" dur="8.91">worse off and at this point in time this</text>
  <text start="406.099" dur="5.371">plan does not help the people whatsoever</text>
  <text start="409.759" dur="4.38">and we&amp;#39;re seeing the Greek lawmakers</text>
  <text start="411.47" dur="4.229">they&amp;#39;re saying listen we don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="414.139" dur="5.911">we&amp;#39;re going to go along with this at all</text>
  <text start="415.699" dur="7.731">I mean this is not what we agreed upon</text>
  <text start="420.05" dur="8.85">the deal came back and it was rewritten</text>
  <text start="423.43" dur="7.27">it&amp;#39;s worse that we agreed upon left this</text>
  <text start="428.9" dur="3.21">group of lawmakers in Greece rule</text>
  <text start="430.7" dur="6.24">surrey&amp;#39;s a party considering voting</text>
  <text start="432.11" dur="7.32">against bailout deal and we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="436.94" dur="7.38">at this and yeah the deal has been</text>
  <text start="439.43" dur="7.95">altered and the Greek defense minister</text>
  <text start="444.32" dur="5.73">saying the bailout deal is a coup the</text>
  <text start="447.38" dur="4.41">deal is beyond what was agreed during</text>
  <text start="450.05" dur="4.98">the political leaders summit under the</text>
  <text start="451.79" dur="5.13">president of the Hellenic Republic which</text>
  <text start="455.03" dur="4.65">the Greek parliament ratified to that</text>
  <text start="456.92" dur="4.62">agreement as a sign of goodwill and even</text>
  <text start="459.68" dur="4.38">though it was against our conscience we</text>
  <text start="461.54" dur="5.49">said yes but to this deal which brings</text>
  <text start="464.06" dur="5.49">new data which talks about fifty billion</text>
  <text start="467.03" dur="5.43">euros as collateral of public assets</text>
  <text start="469.55" dur="6.5">which talks about tu crees for changes</text>
  <text start="472.46" dur="6.36">of laws like the Criminal Procedure Code</text>
  <text start="476.05" dur="6.52">which will lead to house foreclosures</text>
  <text start="478.82" dur="6.39">which refers to a complete collapse even</text>
  <text start="482.57" dur="8.34">of constitutional ideals we cannot agree</text>
  <text start="485.21" dur="10.8">he said and we are seeing that yeah the</text>
  <text start="490.91" dur="8.28">bankers went all-in they want grease on</text>
  <text start="496.01" dur="5.99">its knees they want the Greek people to</text>
  <text start="499.19" dur="7.47">suffer and they&amp;#39;re showing other</text>
  <text start="502" dur="8.44">countries listen you don&amp;#39;t do this this</text>
  <text start="506.66" dur="5.04">is what&amp;#39;s going to happen and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="510.44" dur="3.42">looking at the situation and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="511.7" dur="6.24">saying that Greece still has payments</text>
  <text start="513.86" dur="6.99">coming up and Greece is not going to</text>
  <text start="517.94" dur="5.94">meet a 450 million euro loan repayment</text>
  <text start="520.85" dur="6.15">to the International Monetary Fund that</text>
  <text start="523.88" dur="4.35">falls due on Monday they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="527" dur="4.08">going to reach the payment due at the</text>
  <text start="528.23" dur="5.97">end of the month and they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="531.08" dur="5.76">worried about this samurai bond because</text>
  <text start="534.2" dur="5.1">if this is missed and it isn&amp;#39;t paid</text>
  <text start="536.84" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re saying it could cause a cross</text>
  <text start="539.3" dur="7.71">default on other public bonds a complete</text>
  <text start="543.35" dur="7.23">meltdown of the system and when we look</text>
  <text start="547.01" dur="9.03">at this whole entire situation again the</text>
  <text start="550.58" dur="10.74">people who SAT there and voted and said</text>
  <text start="556.04" dur="8.55">no who are still saying no they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="561.32" dur="5.61">no one cares the central bankers</text>
  <text start="564.59" dur="4.53">want what they want they want to punish</text>
  <text start="566.93" dur="4.17">those people who don&amp;#39;t pay back their</text>
  <text start="569.12" dur="5.46">debt what happened to the investigation</text>
  <text start="571.1" dur="6.6">for odious debt what happened to serezha</text>
  <text start="574.58" dur="6.05">saying no more austerity well this new</text>
  <text start="577.7" dur="6.45">deal that was completely rewritten by</text>
  <text start="580.63" dur="7.9">the central bankers is worse than they</text>
  <text start="584.15" dur="6.57">have ever had before so we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="588.53" dur="3.24">this entire situation and we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="590.72" dur="4.35">have to watch what the Greek government</text>
  <text start="591.77" dur="6.36">does i think the bankers have given</text>
  <text start="595.07" dur="5.37">greece until sunday to come up with the</text>
  <text start="598.13" dur="3.93">decision of what they&amp;#39;re going to do yes</text>
  <text start="600.44" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re going to go along with it no</text>
  <text start="602.06" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re not going to go along with it</text>
  <text start="603.56" dur="5.55">and we&amp;#39;ll have to watch this very</text>
  <text start="605.75" dur="5.46">carefully how this plays out now here in</text>
  <text start="609.11" dur="3.51">the United States of course the United</text>
  <text start="611.21" dur="4.05">States government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="612.62" dur="7.05">telling us that everything is fantastic</text>
  <text start="615.26" dur="7.11">we&amp;#39;re in a recovery more and more jobs</text>
  <text start="619.67" dur="4.74">are being added this is why the</text>
  <text start="622.37" dur="4.47">unemployment is coming down but when we</text>
  <text start="624.41" dur="4.23">look the real economic indicators show</text>
  <text start="626.84" dur="5.27">is completely something opposite of all</text>
  <text start="628.64" dur="6.41">this I mean Macy&amp;#39;s is selling its</text>
  <text start="632.11" dur="6.07">landmark downtown Pittsburgh store</text>
  <text start="635.05" dur="6.43">laying off the people getting rid of it</text>
  <text start="638.18" dur="5.28">we see walmart and Sam&amp;#39;s Club they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="641.48" dur="4.86">laying off a thousand people in their</text>
  <text start="643.46" dur="5.7">corporate offices now if everything is</text>
  <text start="646.34" dur="5.79">perfectly fine and people are getting</text>
  <text start="649.16" dur="4.14">jobs people are taking that money that</text>
  <text start="652.13" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re earning and they&amp;#39;re going out</text>
  <text start="653.3" dur="8.46">and spending it in retail online we</text>
  <text start="657.32" dur="7.02">would see retail expanding we would see</text>
  <text start="661.76" dur="5.22">everything expanding because people have</text>
  <text start="664.34" dur="4.5">extra disposable income but you know</text>
  <text start="666.98" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re saying we&amp;#39;re not seeing that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="668.84" dur="5.67">seeing the opposite actually think about</text>
  <text start="670.58" dur="7.04">it go back to two thousand ten eleven</text>
  <text start="674.51" dur="5.22">twelve when they were telling us the</text>
  <text start="677.62" dur="5.2">unemployment numbers were much higher</text>
  <text start="679.73" dur="7.44">and now they&amp;#39;re almost half of what they</text>
  <text start="682.82" dur="6.78">were why are stores closing why are they</text>
  <text start="687.17" dur="4.2">going out of business wire major</text>
  <text start="689.6" dur="4.08">corporations laying off more and more</text>
  <text start="691.37" dur="5.61">people something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense why</text>
  <text start="693.68" dur="7.769">was the last holiday season though</text>
  <text start="696.98" dur="7.409">first we&amp;#39;ve seen if unemployment is half</text>
  <text start="701.449" dur="5.07">of what it was think about it it makes</text>
  <text start="704.389" dur="3.961">no sense and of course people are out</text>
  <text start="706.519" dur="3.721">there saying oh it&amp;#39;s the online retail</text>
  <text start="708.35" dur="3.69">well then why didn&amp;#39;t sigh for Monday why</text>
  <text start="710.24" dur="3.33">wasn&amp;#39;t that incredible it should have</text>
  <text start="712.04" dur="5.34">picked up all the slack from Black</text>
  <text start="713.57" dur="7.17">Friday right it didn&amp;#39;t not even close</text>
  <text start="717.38" dur="5.009">and the whole holiday season was a</text>
  <text start="720.74" dur="6.57">complete disaster during the holiday</text>
  <text start="722.389" dur="7.471">season stores were closing down going</text>
  <text start="727.31" dur="5.31">out of business laying off people and as</text>
  <text start="729.86" dur="6.719">soon as the holiday season was over more</text>
  <text start="732.62" dur="6.6">of the same but we know the central</text>
  <text start="736.579" dur="6.031">bankers are preparing they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="739.22" dur="4.979">ready to take your money from the</text>
  <text start="742.61" dur="5.729">banking system we know the bail and</text>
  <text start="744.199" dur="6.871">documents were created they don&amp;#39;t create</text>
  <text start="748.339" dur="6.18">them for no reason they&amp;#39;re creating all</text>
  <text start="751.07" dur="6">of this for a reason and when we look</text>
  <text start="754.519" dur="5.281">closely at it we start to see some</text>
  <text start="757.07" dur="4.47">strange things that we that at least I</text>
  <text start="759.8" dur="4.589">haven&amp;#39;t noticed before but now when I</text>
  <text start="761.54" dur="5.88">look at it it&amp;#39;s becoming clearer and</text>
  <text start="764.389" dur="5.211">clearer as we go along now we know</text>
  <text start="767.42" dur="4.919">they&amp;#39;ve created the beylin documents and</text>
  <text start="769.6" dur="4.299">we know what they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="772.339" dur="3.391">they&amp;#39;re going to take those funds that</text>
  <text start="773.899" dur="7.05">are in the bank and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="775.73" dur="11.28">turn them into stocks basically of the</text>
  <text start="780.949" dur="11.431">bank and if the bank should fail what is</text>
  <text start="787.01" dur="10.069">going to happen here well these stocks</text>
  <text start="792.38" dur="7.019">then they&amp;#39;re a liability of the bank and</text>
  <text start="797.079" dur="7.57">they would be in danger of being written</text>
  <text start="799.399" dur="7.471">down should the bank fail so if a large</text>
  <text start="804.649" dur="3.961">bank fails in the US your deposits at</text>
  <text start="806.87" dur="4.709">this bank would either be written down</text>
  <text start="808.61" dur="4.589">or converted into equity or stock shares</text>
  <text start="811.579" dur="4.051">in the company and once they are</text>
  <text start="813.199" dur="7.711">converted to equity you are a</text>
  <text start="815.63" dur="10.829">shareholder not a depositor you are no</text>
  <text start="820.91" dur="9.96">longer insured by the FDIC so if the</text>
  <text start="826.459" dur="9.721">bank then fails so does your deposit</text>
  <text start="830.87" dur="6.87">it fails it disappears bye-bye so even</text>
  <text start="836.18" dur="4.95">though they&amp;#39;re telling you they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="837.74" dur="5.19">taking a portion of your account like in</text>
  <text start="841.13" dur="4.26">Cyprus they took forty seven percent on</text>
  <text start="842.93" dur="6.18">average and they replaced it with</text>
  <text start="845.39" dur="7.11">worthless bang stock if that bank goes</text>
  <text start="849.11" dur="8.94">under you&amp;#39;re no longer covered by the</text>
  <text start="852.5" dur="9.14">FDIC for that bank stock hmm very</text>
  <text start="858.05" dur="8.1">interesting everything they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="861.64" dur="7.63">benefits them it does not benefit the</text>
  <text start="866.15" dur="5.25">people and you can see why the people in</text>
  <text start="869.27" dur="4.74">Greece decided hmmm maybe we should stay</text>
  <text start="871.4" dur="4.71">up taking out our funds from the bank</text>
  <text start="874.01" dur="4.11">because we can see what&amp;#39;s happening they</text>
  <text start="876.11" dur="4.56">saw what happened to their neighbors in</text>
  <text start="878.12" dur="5.58">Cyprus and they knew they didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="880.67" dur="4.59">this to happen once again so they went</text>
  <text start="883.7" dur="3.72">out and they took out their money as</text>
  <text start="885.26" dur="4.26">much as they possibly could here in the</text>
  <text start="887.42" dur="4.74">United States and throughout European</text>
  <text start="889.52" dur="6.18">nations who don&amp;#39;t understand who are not</text>
  <text start="892.16" dur="6.99">really paying attention once they lock</text>
  <text start="895.7" dur="7.889">down the banks you will no longer be</text>
  <text start="899.15" dur="6.54">able to take that money out it will be</text>
  <text start="903.589" dur="3.511">stuck in there yes you have a little</text>
  <text start="905.69" dur="3.63">portion that you can take out each day</text>
  <text start="907.1" dur="6.96">depending on what they set it on like in</text>
  <text start="909.32" dur="6.03">Greece it&amp;#39;s 60 euros per day and if you</text>
  <text start="914.06" dur="3.21">have a lot more than that in the bank</text>
  <text start="915.35" dur="4.67">it&amp;#39;s going to be a very long time before</text>
  <text start="917.27" dur="6.92">you get it out it will be converted into</text>
  <text start="920.02" dur="8.59">stock before you even are able to touch</text>
  <text start="924.19" dur="6.91">that amount that&amp;#39;s in there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="928.61" dur="6.479">going to take whatever they need to</text>
  <text start="931.1" dur="5.7">recapitalize the banks so when people</text>
  <text start="935.089" dur="4.081">ask why do they need these documents</text>
  <text start="936.8" dur="6.57">this is why they need it because when it</text>
  <text start="939.17" dur="7.26">comes time and the government isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="943.37" dur="5.55">going to bail them out they will say</text>
  <text start="946.43" dur="6.24">well we have this document from the FDIC</text>
  <text start="948.92" dur="5.82">Bank of England Europe has it Australia</text>
  <text start="952.67" dur="4.95">has it New Zealand has it Canada has it</text>
  <text start="954.74" dur="6.63">and we can go ahead and shut down the</text>
  <text start="957.62" dur="6.48">banks and take what we need and the rest</text>
  <text start="961.37" dur="6.37">is going to be converted</text>
  <text start="964.1" dur="5.17">basically they&amp;#39;re just taking it all so</text>
  <text start="967.74" dur="3.81">we can see at this point in time that</text>
  <text start="969.27" dur="5.73">everyone needs to be prepared for this</text>
  <text start="971.55" dur="5.25">you need to be ready personally I only</text>
  <text start="975" dur="4.92">keep as much as I need to pay my bills</text>
  <text start="976.8" dur="4.65">the rest is in cash the rest is in gold</text>
  <text start="979.92" dur="5.28">and silver of course do not tell people</text>
  <text start="981.45" dur="5.55">where you&amp;#39;re putting it and this is what</text>
  <text start="985.2" dur="3.12">everyone should be thinking of at this</text>
  <text start="987" dur="2.73">point because you don&amp;#39;t want to be in</text>
  <text start="988.32" dur="4.74">that situation where you wake up in</text>
  <text start="989.73" dur="5.25">Saturday and say oh my god I never got</text>
  <text start="993.06" dur="4.02">around to doing this and all my money is</text>
  <text start="994.98" dur="7.609">stuck in there and now the banks are on</text>

  <text start="2314.57" dur="4.259">has been having a very tough time</text>
  <text start="2316.369" dur="3.99">fighting their own people they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="2318.829" dur="3.631">not fighting the Islamic state this is</text>
  <text start="2320.359" dur="4.621">really the people rising up in the</text>
  <text start="2322.46" dur="4.379">country trying to take back a rack just</text>
  <text start="2324.98" dur="5.55">like it&amp;#39;s happening in Lebanon Libya</text>
  <text start="2326.839" dur="5.641">Yemen they&amp;#39;re using the Islamic state to</text>
  <text start="2330.53" dur="3.54">show that there&amp;#39;s chaos in there that</text>
  <text start="2332.48" dur="3.27">the Islamic state has been taking over</text>
  <text start="2334.07" dur="3.69">but really the Islamic state is really</text>
  <text start="2335.75" dur="6.05">the Free Syrian Army which is really in</text>
  <text start="2337.76" dur="7.53">Syria they&amp;#39;re using that to hit a</text>
  <text start="2341.8" dur="5.23">Damascus to get rid of Assad and then</text>
  <text start="2345.29" dur="3.96">they have the Islamic state in all these</text>
  <text start="2347.03" dur="4.65">other countries to cause chaos to make</text>
  <text start="2349.25" dur="4.53">you believe that the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="2351.68" dur="4.2">all over the place this way they can use</text>
  <text start="2353.78" dur="3.72">the authorization for war which says</text>
  <text start="2355.88" dur="4.41">they can go after the Islamic state in</text>
  <text start="2357.5" dur="4.619">any one of these countries right now the</text>
  <text start="2360.29" dur="4.17">authorization for war only says they can</text>
  <text start="2362.119" dur="3.75">go after al-qaeda so they need the new</text>
  <text start="2364.46" dur="4.74">one approved but it&amp;#39;s just sitting in</text>
  <text start="2365.869" dur="5.881">Congress it is going absolutely nowhere</text>
  <text start="2369.2" dur="3.96">now we know the Islamic state the proxy</text>
  <text start="2371.75" dur="3.78">army of united&amp;#39;s government central</text>
  <text start="2373.16" dur="5.06">bankers in Israel continually put out</text>
  <text start="2375.53" dur="5.67">propaganda of people being decapitated</text>
  <text start="2378.22" dur="6.72">people being drowned people being burned</text>
  <text start="2381.2" dur="6.899">and all this is to keep us in fear and</text>
  <text start="2384.94" dur="4.81">of course when these come out we look at</text>
  <text start="2388.099" dur="3.541">it we say I&amp;#39;ll look see this doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2389.75" dur="3.15">match the knife&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t match there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="2391.64" dur="3.06">blood when they were cutting into the</text>
  <text start="2392.9" dur="4.23">person&amp;#39;s neck and we called it fake</text>
  <text start="2394.7" dur="5.07">phony and falls now all of a sudden we</text>
  <text start="2397.13" dur="5.52">see a video that was released by cyber</text>
  <text start="2399.77" dur="4.799">burcu and they&amp;#39;re saying that this was</text>
  <text start="2402.65" dur="4.64">completely staged here&amp;#39;s the sound</text>
  <text start="2404.569" dur="6.331">studio here&amp;#39;s the people standing there</text>
  <text start="2407.29" dur="5.59">during the filming and I&amp;#39;m looking at it</text>
  <text start="2410.9" dur="5.4">I don&amp;#39;t know where the where it actually</text>
  <text start="2412.88" dur="8.31">really came from the origins of it who</text>
  <text start="2416.3" dur="8.16">the people are responsible for this and</text>
  <text start="2421.19" dur="6.27">what strikes me as odd is they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="2424.46" dur="6.5">that this video was hacked by cyber Baku</text>
  <text start="2427.46" dur="6.389">from a device of Senator John McCain</text>
  <text start="2430.96" dur="5.08">from one of his staffers who was on a</text>
  <text start="2433.849" dur="5.031">trip to ukraine now the question is why</text>
  <text start="2436.04" dur="5.91">would they be carrying this around if</text>
  <text start="2438.88" dur="7.3">they&amp;#39;re visiting Ukraine why would they</text>
  <text start="2441.95" dur="7.55">even have this on them so this to me</text>
  <text start="2446.18" dur="6.6">seems like this might be fake and we</text>
  <text start="2449.5" dur="5.2">might see in a couple days later where</text>
  <text start="2452.78" dur="3.45">they come out and they say ah look look</text>
  <text start="2454.7" dur="3.84">at all those people that reporter on it</text>
  <text start="2456.23" dur="4.05">you see they&amp;#39;ll believe anything and it</text>
  <text start="2458.54" dur="4.44">turns out to be completely fake it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="2460.28" dur="6.96">propaganda to make the independent media</text>
  <text start="2462.98" dur="7.619">look really bad and this part of hacking</text>
  <text start="2467.24" dur="5.94">into Senator John McCain while on a trip</text>
  <text start="2470.599" dur="5.97">to ukraine that is the red flag for me</text>
  <text start="2473.18" dur="5.61">because there is no way in the world</text>
  <text start="2476.569" dur="5.851">that someone would be carrying this</text>
  <text start="2478.79" dur="7.17">around with them it makes no sense to do</text>
  <text start="2482.42" dur="7.53">so this stuff would be kept under lock</text>
  <text start="2485.96" dur="6.18">and key so right now I&amp;#39;m holding off on</text>
  <text start="2489.95" dur="4.169">this to say that this is actually real</text>
  <text start="2492.14" dur="3.6">because I&amp;#39;m thinking they&amp;#39;re using this</text>
  <text start="2494.119" dur="4.011">to give Vince everyone that the</text>
  <text start="2495.74" dur="5.22">independent media is a bunch of morons</text>
  <text start="2498.13" dur="6.09">now out in Syria there is a report that</text>
  <text start="2500.96" dur="5.82">in a Syrian intelligence chief was</text>
  <text start="2504.22" dur="4.84">assassinated chances of his death were</text>
  <text start="2506.78" dur="4.44">not made immediately clear and right now</text>
  <text start="2509.06" dur="4.559">no official government source confirm</text>
  <text start="2511.22" dur="3.84">the report but as we know the United</text>
  <text start="2513.619" dur="3.45">States government central bankers and</text>
  <text start="2515.06" dur="5.88">other coalition forces are inside Syria</text>
  <text start="2517.069" dur="6.691">and we know they are gunning for Assad</text>
  <text start="2520.94" dur="5.399">or anyone high in his organization and</text>
  <text start="2523.76" dur="4.02">we know they would assassinate these</text>
  <text start="2526.339" dur="4.201">people because what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="2527.78" dur="4.26">is they&amp;#39;re trying to remove Assad and</text>
  <text start="2530.54" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;ll do it anyway they possibly can</text>
  <text start="2532.04" dur="7.529">and as we know they are making a move</text>
  <text start="2536.21" dur="6.75">coming very soon to get into Syria and</text>
  <text start="2539.569" dur="7.441">remove Assad this is the whole entire</text>
  <text start="2542.96" dur="6.51">plan and if they can remove more of his</text>
  <text start="2547.01" dur="6.69">staff or even him it would make it</text>
  <text start="2549.47" dur="6.59">easier for them to take over Syria</text>
  <text start="2553.7" dur="5.49">and we can see at this point in time</text>
  <text start="2556.06" dur="7.3">with the Free Syrian Army coming from</text>
  <text start="2559.19" dur="7.26">Turkey moving south the proxy army out</text>
  <text start="2563.36" dur="8.01">to the east moving west now the safe</text>
  <text start="2566.45" dur="6.57">zones that they want to implement we see</text>
  <text start="2571.37" dur="5.19">the Free Syrian Army coming up from the</text>
  <text start="2573.02" dur="6.18">south moving north they are surrounding</text>
  <text start="2576.56" dur="6.27">Damascus and we see at this point in</text>
  <text start="2579.2" dur="7.53">time that they are just waiting for the</text>
  <text start="2582.83" dur="7.2">event and for the go-ahead to move into</text>
  <text start="2586.73" dur="7.05">Damascus and take out Assad this has</text>
  <text start="2590.03" dur="5.64">been the plan all along and we see they</text>
  <text start="2593.78" dur="3.87">are building towards this listen</text>
