  <text start="55.69" dur="5.19">when he to report my name is Dave and</text>
  <text start="57.31" dur="6.06">this is episode 1612 a n today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="60.88" dur="5.19">July 10th 2018 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="63.37" dur="6.09">episode is the economy just hit the wall</text>
  <text start="66.07" dur="5.16">everything is about to change let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="69.46" dur="4.14">into the economic collapse financial</text>
  <text start="71.23" dur="4.65">news now yesterday we talked about how</text>
  <text start="73.6" dur="4.77">the brexit plan isn&amp;#39;t going the way</text>
  <text start="75.88" dur="4.47">everyone thought it was gonna go and two</text>
  <text start="78.37" dur="5.85">people resigned already Davis and</text>
  <text start="80.35" dur="6.84">Johnson and now we see more individuals</text>
  <text start="84.22" dur="6.84">they decided to resign Maria Caulfield</text>
  <text start="87.19" dur="7.05">and Ben Bradley they resigned on Tuesday</text>
  <text start="91.06" dur="6.809">because of Teresa Mays soft brexit plan</text>
  <text start="94.24" dur="5.519">and Caulfield went off went on to say</text>
  <text start="97.869" dur="4.561">that I cannot support the direction of</text>
  <text start="99.759" dur="4.201">travel in the brexit negotiations which</text>
  <text start="102.43" dur="4.37">in my view do not fully embrace the</text>
  <text start="103.96" dur="5.79">opportunities that brexit can provide</text>
  <text start="106.8" dur="6.22">Bradley also wrote a very similar letter</text>
  <text start="109.75" dur="6.69">and we see at this point that the</text>
  <text start="113.02" dur="5.73">central bank establishment those people</text>
  <text start="116.44" dur="5.7">who are not elected those people who</text>
  <text start="118.75" dur="6.15">want to keep this all together they are</text>
  <text start="122.14" dur="4.71">going to do whatever they can to try to</text>
  <text start="124.9" dur="3.42">keep it together and this is why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="126.85" dur="3.389">been taking so long and this is why</text>
  <text start="128.32" dur="3.84">we&amp;#39;re not seeing the outcome that we</text>
  <text start="130.239" dur="3.931">thought we were going to see and these</text>
  <text start="132.16" dur="3.87">individuals now are saying okay we see</text>
  <text start="134.17" dur="5.069">the writing on the wall here they are</text>
  <text start="136.03" dur="5.91">not going to move in the direction that</text>
  <text start="139.239" dur="5.371">we would like and everyone is jumping</text>
  <text start="141.94" dur="3.81">ship at this point so we&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="144.61" dur="3.689">to see what happens and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="145.75" dur="5.79">see what the people of the UK do at this</text>
  <text start="148.299" dur="5.281">point because again they voted to get</text>
  <text start="151.54" dur="4.71">out of the EU and it is not happening</text>
  <text start="153.58" dur="5.7">the way they wanted they maybe maybe</text>
  <text start="156.25" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;ll remove Teresa may in the end of</text>
  <text start="159.28" dur="4.86">all of this we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see</text>
  <text start="160.63" dur="7.889">but again that people do have the final</text>
  <text start="164.14" dur="6.51">choice on what they want to do here we</text>
  <text start="168.519" dur="4.851">see here in the United States what is</text>
  <text start="170.65" dur="5.49">happening is they&amp;#39;re releasing</text>
  <text start="173.37" dur="5.13">ridiculous data we know that the</text>
  <text start="176.14" dur="6.39">unemployment numbers are completely</text>
  <text start="178.5" dur="5.08">manipulated we know that job openings</text>
  <text start="182.53" dur="2.49">that they keep saying there&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="183.58" dur="2.52">jobs out there we just can&amp;#39;t find anyone</text>
  <text start="185.02" dur="3">to fill them we know</text>
  <text start="186.1" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s ridiculous and we&amp;#39;re gonna show</text>
  <text start="188.02" dur="5.13">why it is ridiculous but when we look at</text>
  <text start="191.32" dur="4.35">this we can see that they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="193.15" dur="5.91">people are quitting their jobs because</text>
  <text start="195.67" dur="6.03">they can find better jobs well nobody</text>
  <text start="199.06" dur="5.85">just quits their job and then goes out</text>
  <text start="201.7" dur="6.78">and looks for another job if you have a</text>
  <text start="204.91" dur="5.79">job you go and you look for another job</text>
  <text start="208.48" dur="6.27">that maybe will pay you more money and</text>
  <text start="210.7" dur="6.6">then once you have that job you quit so</text>
  <text start="214.75" dur="4.56">this idea that everyone is quitting</text>
  <text start="217.3" dur="4.77">because there are so many jobs out there</text>
  <text start="219.31" dur="5.13">is absolutely ridiculous and the idea</text>
  <text start="222.07" dur="4.65">that there&amp;#39;s so many jobs out there and</text>
  <text start="224.44" dur="5.13">they can&amp;#39;t find qualified workers that</text>
  <text start="226.72" dur="4.56">is also ridiculous actually when we look</text>
  <text start="229.57" dur="4.74">at the job hires verse 12-month</text>
  <text start="231.28" dur="5.25">cumulative change in payroll we see the</text>
  <text start="234.31" dur="6.03">same thing happen that that happened</text>
  <text start="236.53" dur="6.24">back in 2006 7 &amp;amp; 8 everything is</text>
  <text start="240.34" dur="4.62">starting to roll over and things are</text>
  <text start="242.77" dur="4.61">going down the other way now we</text>
  <text start="244.96" dur="5.13">understand that the American population</text>
  <text start="247.38" dur="5.29">they are at their limit right now and we</text>
  <text start="250.09" dur="4.89">can see from the consumer credit that</text>
  <text start="252.67" dur="4.68">has exploded much much higher right now</text>
  <text start="254.98" dur="5.19">and we&amp;#39;re much higher than it was back</text>
  <text start="257.35" dur="5.22">in 2008 and it&amp;#39;s continually moving up</text>
  <text start="260.17" dur="4.86">because what is happening here is many</text>
  <text start="262.57" dur="4.2">of the individuals they can&amp;#39;t make ends</text>
  <text start="265.03" dur="7.26">meet so what do you do use credit cards</text>
  <text start="266.77" dur="7.92">and today people can&amp;#39;t survive without</text>
  <text start="272.29" dur="4.98">credit cards remove all credit remove</text>
  <text start="274.69" dur="6.69">all personal loans remove everything try</text>
  <text start="277.27" dur="6.42">to survive on your salary and people</text>
  <text start="281.38" dur="4.41">will find that it is very very difficult</text>
  <text start="283.69" dur="5.73">to do so paying your rent paying your</text>
  <text start="285.79" dur="4.89">car paying everything with cash and this</text>
  <text start="289.42" dur="5.25">is why they needed to come up with</text>
  <text start="290.68" dur="5.46">credit to make you feel like oh I can go</text>
  <text start="294.67" dur="3.66">out and purchase something and this is</text>
  <text start="296.14" dur="4.14">why they keep saying oh look the credit</text>
  <text start="298.33" dur="4.14">has gone up people are more in debt this</text>
  <text start="300.28" dur="4.38">means the economy is doing well no this</text>
  <text start="302.47" dur="4.2">means the central bankers are doing well</text>
  <text start="304.66" dur="3.96">it means the economy and the people</text>
  <text start="306.67" dur="6.84">there going further and further into</text>
  <text start="308.62" dur="7.2">debt we see BMW they decided to leave</text>
  <text start="313.51" dur="4.59">South Carolina</text>
  <text start="315.82" dur="4.29">and they are now making a deal with</text>
  <text start="318.1" dur="3.51">China and of course they&amp;#39;re blaming this</text>
  <text start="320.11" dur="3.75">all on the tariffs and things like that</text>
  <text start="321.61" dur="6.33">and they&amp;#39;re moving their manufacturing</text>
  <text start="323.86" dur="6.45">out of the states so BMW they are the</text>
  <text start="327.94" dur="4.67">largest US auto exporter and employs</text>
  <text start="330.31" dur="5.88">around 10,000 people at a plant in</text>
  <text start="332.61" dur="6.4">Spartanburg South Carolina the brands</text>
  <text start="336.19" dur="5.52">key SUV models are produced there and</text>
  <text start="339.01" dur="3.87">they sign an agreement with a Chinese</text>
  <text start="341.71" dur="3.3">partner brilliant Automotive Group</text>
  <text start="342.88" dur="4.77">Holdings and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="345.01" dur="5.28">moving the manufacturing out of the</text>
  <text start="347.65" dur="4.8">states now again manufacturing has been</text>
  <text start="350.29" dur="4.47">moving out of the states for quite a</text>
  <text start="352.45" dur="4.86">while and to start bringing back</text>
  <text start="354.76" dur="4.5">manufacturing out of the blue it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="357.31" dur="4.89">be very very difficult and this is why</text>
  <text start="359.26" dur="5.91">it&amp;#39;s not working because the deep state</text>
  <text start="362.2" dur="6.51">essential bankers they spent a very very</text>
  <text start="365.17" dur="5.46">long time moving everything out of the</text>
  <text start="368.71" dur="4.41">United States and to try to bring</text>
  <text start="370.63" dur="4.62">everything back within a year or two it</text>
  <text start="373.12" dur="4.73">just wasn&amp;#39;t going to work and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="375.25" dur="6.6">changed a lot of laws change a lot of</text>
  <text start="377.85" dur="6.73">taxes change a lot of things to allow</text>
  <text start="381.85" dur="5.4">these corporations to come back and at</text>
  <text start="384.58" dur="5.7">this point it&amp;#39;s not going to happen not</text>
  <text start="387.25" dur="7.05">in this short period of time if we shut</text>
  <text start="390.28" dur="6.12">down the central bank economy and get</text>
  <text start="394.3" dur="3.84">rid of a lot of these laws over the many</text>
  <text start="396.4" dur="3.51">many years yes a lot of this</text>
  <text start="398.14" dur="3.78">manufacturing these manufacturing</text>
  <text start="399.91" dur="5.88">companies can come back to the United</text>
  <text start="401.92" dur="6.66">States but when we look at the real data</text>
  <text start="405.79" dur="5.73">here in the United States the economy</text>
  <text start="408.58" dur="4.74">hit the wall already and this is why</text>
  <text start="411.52" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;ve been tracking all of this we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="413.32" dur="6.42">been tracking how the economy&amp;#39;s doing so</text>
  <text start="416.41" dur="5.37">when you know presidents come and go and</text>
  <text start="419.74" dur="3.78">they tell you that oh the economy doing</text>
  <text start="421.78" dur="5.31">poorly because of this person we</text>
  <text start="423.52" dur="5.94">understand that this is a lie because we</text>
  <text start="427.09" dur="5.37">know what&amp;#39;s been happening now the</text>
  <text start="429.46" dur="4.98">average consumer as we know they are</text>
  <text start="432.46" dur="4.32">forced to use their credit cards to</text>
  <text start="434.44" dur="4.77">maintain their current lifestyle because</text>
  <text start="436.78" dur="5.91">as we know as inflation hits and</text>
  <text start="439.21" dur="5.28">salaries well they&amp;#39;re not going up how</text>
  <text start="442.69" dur="5.19">do you make ends meet you have to use</text>
  <text start="444.49" dur="4.39">credit the homebuilder sector and while</text>
  <text start="447.88" dur="3.58">they&amp;#39;re in trouble</text>
  <text start="448.88" dur="4.08">a Colorado based credit union is now</text>
  <text start="451.46" dur="4.5">offering zero percent down payment</text>
  <text start="452.96" dur="4.41">mortgages credit union of Colorado will</text>
  <text start="455.96" dur="5.46">underwrite the three percent down</text>
  <text start="457.37" dur="6.15">payment and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</text>

  <text start="465.74" dur="4.13">giving the buyer an interest-free loan</text>
  <text start="467.45" dur="5.79">that is repayable at a future date or</text>
  <text start="469.87" dur="5.92">maybe through refinancing the bank is</text>
  <text start="473.24" dur="4.74">charging 0.375 percent more for the</text>
  <text start="475.79" dur="4.56">mortgage than the rate for a three</text>

  <text start="480.35" dur="5.19">the bank is betting the value of these</text>
  <text start="482.51" dur="7.31">homes will rise enough to cover the</text>
  <text start="485.54" dur="6.96">three percent down payment but will it</text>
  <text start="489.82" dur="5.44">most likely not because housing prices</text>
  <text start="492.5" dur="4.92">are now falling when we look at this</text>
  <text start="495.26" dur="5.34">whole thing it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a zero down</text>

  <text start="500.6" dur="5.55">government and banks they&amp;#39;re becoming</text>
  <text start="504.02" dur="4.26">desperate right now because they</text>
  <text start="506.15" dur="5.13">understand that the pool of borrowers</text>
  <text start="508.28" dur="5.46">who qualify for mortgages they&amp;#39;re drying</text>
  <text start="511.28" dur="4.52">up why do you think the automobile</text>
  <text start="513.74" dur="4.59">industry went into the subprime market</text>
  <text start="515.8" dur="5.26">the same thing is happening with the</text>
  <text start="518.33" dur="5.31">housing market those who could afford a</text>

  <text start="536.06" dur="4.77">to show a tight labor market this is</text>
  <text start="538.97" dur="4.17">absolutely ridiculous remember there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="540.83" dur="4.89">about 95 million working-age people are</text>

  <text start="678.06" dur="4.89">putting out Help Wanted they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="680.97" dur="3.9">saying hey we need someone to fill this</text>

  <text start="687.27" dur="7.56">and they know they will never fill these</text>
  <text start="690.89" dur="6.25">so the economy right now is contracting</text>
  <text start="694.83" dur="5.55">very very quickly it has hit a wall</text>
  <text start="697.14" dur="5.43">already and when we use other indicators</text>
  <text start="700.38" dur="5.37">we can see that what they&amp;#39;re putting out</text>
  <text start="702.57" dur="6.78">there is fake phony and false and very</text>
  <text start="705.75" dur="6.24">soon everything is going to change think</text>
  <text start="709.35" dur="4.77">about what&amp;#39;s happening right now the Fed</text>
  <text start="711.99" dur="3.24">is hiding data let&amp;#39;s get rid of the</text>
  <text start="714.12" dur="2.88">yield curve</text>
  <text start="715.23" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s not really a good indicator of what</text>
  <text start="717" dur="4.02">the economy is doing and we really</text>
  <text start="719.76" dur="4.26">shouldn&amp;#39;t be looking at that let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="721.02" dur="4.98">rid of the balance sheet of the Fed</text>
  <text start="724.02" dur="3.54">let&amp;#39;s get rid of that data we see the</text>
  <text start="726" dur="3.03">mainstream media out there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="727.56" dur="3.18">saying that the economy is gonna go in</text>
  <text start="729.03" dur="3.48">is gonna be going into a recession the</text>
  <text start="730.74" dur="4.47">Fed is saying that the tariffs might</text>
  <text start="732.51" dur="4.56">wreck the economy and we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="735.21" dur="4.02">see a lot of this coming out of the</text>
  <text start="737.07" dur="4.29">mainstream media and we really haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="739.23" dur="5.13">seen this before now remember we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="741.36" dur="4.56">tracking this since 2008 we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="744.36" dur="3.87">showing that the economy has not</text>
  <text start="745.92" dur="3.75">improving what we&amp;#39;ve been showing and</text>
  <text start="748.23" dur="4.47">there&amp;#39;s a reason why we&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="749.67" dur="6.21">this we&amp;#39;ve been showing that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="752.7" dur="4.56">built an illusion and we look through</text>
  <text start="755.88" dur="3.24">all the numbers we look through</text>
  <text start="757.26" dur="4.05">everything they&amp;#39;ve been doing and we</text>
  <text start="759.12" dur="5.34">watched people lose their jobs we watch</text>
  <text start="761.31" dur="6.75">stores closed we watch the bubbles being</text>
  <text start="764.46" dur="6.86">pumped up in the 20 cities we watch how</text>
  <text start="768.06" dur="6.06">they used subprime in the auto industry</text>
  <text start="771.32" dur="5.98">we watched how they channel stuffed the</text>
  <text start="774.12" dur="4.77">auto market we&amp;#39;ve been watching all this</text>
  <text start="777.3" dur="3.84">we&amp;#39;ve been watching the corporation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="778.89" dur="6.06">buy back their stock manipulate their</text>
  <text start="781.14" dur="7.08">books go into debt how they manipulated</text>
  <text start="784.95" dur="4.95">the stock market with central banks</text>
  <text start="788.22" dur="5.01">around the world buying the tech stocks</text>
  <text start="789.9" dur="4.71">especially the Swiss we&amp;#39;ve been watching</text>
  <text start="793.23" dur="4.46">well this and we&amp;#39;ve been doing it for a</text>
  <text start="794.61" dur="5.28">reason so this time they can&amp;#39;t say hey</text>
  <text start="797.69" dur="5.01">it was because of this or because of</text>
  <text start="799.89" dur="4.71">that the economy never recovered the</text>
  <text start="802.7" dur="3.67">only thing that happened was they</text>
  <text start="804.6" dur="3.6">created a lot of currency they propped</text>
  <text start="806.37" dur="3.54">up the banks which aren&amp;#39;t really propped</text>
  <text start="808.2" dur="4.41">up they&amp;#39;re in solvent too because the</text>
  <text start="809.91" dur="4.95">stress tests are fake but now we see the</text>
  <text start="812.61" dur="4.98">corporate media out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="814.86" dur="5.61">pushing the idea that everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="817.59" dur="5.28">starting to turn that the economy</text>
  <text start="820.47" dur="4.2">doesn&amp;#39;t look that great anymore and this</text>
  <text start="822.87" dur="4.08">is because of Trump now we said this</text>
  <text start="824.67" dur="5.34">two-year open what a year-and-a-half ago</text>
  <text start="826.95" dur="5.31">if Trump was elected and he spent some</text>
  <text start="830.01" dur="5.1">time in office they were going to say</text>
  <text start="832.26" dur="4.74">his economic policies have destroyed the</text>
  <text start="835.11" dur="3.81">economy well he&amp;#39;s really done nothing</text>
  <text start="837" dur="4.47">he&amp;#39;s using the same calculations that</text>
  <text start="838.92" dur="3.72">were there before the tariffs they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="841.47" dur="3.12">really not doing anything</text>
  <text start="842.64" dur="3.33">I know people there&amp;#39;s a lot of people</text>
  <text start="844.59" dur="4.05">out there all the tariffs are still it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="845.97" dur="2.96">you know wrecking the economy it really</text>
  <text start="848.64" dur="3.47">has</text>
  <text start="848.93" dur="7.25">the economy was already wrecked has that</text>
  <text start="852.11" dur="6.45">nothing to help or destroy the economy</text>
  <text start="856.18" dur="4.87">what has been happening here is the</text>
  <text start="858.56" dur="4.279">economy has been self-destructing this</text>
  <text start="861.05" dur="4.979">is what the central banking system does</text>
  <text start="862.839" dur="5.651">it doesn&amp;#39;t get better it doesn&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="866.029" dur="7.081">know all of a sudden blossom into</text>
  <text start="868.49" dur="8.37">something that&amp;#39;s incredible it contracts</text>
  <text start="873.11" dur="7.229">the debt load gets heavier people lose</text>
  <text start="876.86" dur="5.52">their jobs retail suffers wages decline</text>
  <text start="880.339" dur="3.841">they can&amp;#39;t raise interest rates because</text>
  <text start="882.38" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s too much debt this is what</text>
  <text start="884.18" dur="6.15">happens and the only alternative right</text>
  <text start="886.7" dur="6.21">now is to turn this around and say the</text>
  <text start="890.33" dur="4.89">economy is not doing well now it hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="892.91" dur="3.6">been doing well all these unemployment</text>
  <text start="895.22" dur="4.8">GDP and the rest of the numbers have</text>
  <text start="896.51" dur="4.98">been fake and of course what you do is</text>
  <text start="900.02" dur="3.21">you go back in time and then you look at</text>
  <text start="901.49" dur="3.33">this and say oh yeah look it was fake</text>
  <text start="903.23" dur="3.359">just like the subprime securities when</text>
  <text start="904.82" dur="6.18">they said they were triple-a back in</text>
  <text start="906.589" dur="6.721">2006 2007 2008 and of course in 2009-10</text>
  <text start="911" dur="4.74">everyone goes back hey by the way those</text>
  <text start="913.31" dur="4.62">were never triple-a those were fake</text>
  <text start="915.74" dur="5.539">ratings and it&amp;#39;s very easy to go back in</text>
  <text start="917.93" dur="6.21">time so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="921.279" dur="4.721">the corporate media they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="924.14" dur="5.639">and they&amp;#39;re telling us the economy&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="926" dur="6.3">doing well park Barclays published its</text>
  <text start="929.779" dur="4.711">quarterly global macro survey which</text>
  <text start="932.3" dur="4.47">pulls over 400 institutional investors</text>
  <text start="934.49" dur="5.55">from around the world across asset</text>
  <text start="936.77" dur="7.08">classes and the very first question</text>
  <text start="940.04" dur="5.989">revealed was troubling when asked about</text>
  <text start="943.85" dur="4.83">their expectations for global growth is</text>
  <text start="946.029" dur="5.8">the economy likely to perform similar to</text>
  <text start="948.68" dur="5.13">consensus expectations and if not we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="951.829" dur="4.981">disappoint or delight for the first time</text>
  <text start="953.81" dur="4.29">in at least four years more than half of</text>
  <text start="956.81" dur="4.71">the respondents responded that a</text>
  <text start="958.1" dur="6.57">disappointment lies ahead yes they know</text>
  <text start="961.52" dur="6.54">what&amp;#39;s coming we see out of the San</text>
  <text start="964.67" dur="6.6">Francisco fed saying that Trump&amp;#39;s tax</text>
  <text start="968.06" dur="5.46">cut well they might be overly optimistic</text>
  <text start="971.27" dur="4.02">well that was just to pushed us out a</text>
  <text start="973.52" dur="3.84">little bit further it was not going to</text>
  <text start="975.29" dur="3.239">solve the problem of the economy it was</text>
  <text start="977.36" dur="2.46">to keep everything and to keep the</text>
  <text start="978.529" dur="3.031">illusion going for a little bit longer</text>
  <text start="979.82" dur="2.55">because what we&amp;#39;re gonna see Trump do</text>
  <text start="981.56" dur="2.219">now and the pay</text>
  <text start="982.37" dur="3.209">they&amp;#39;re gonna start to turn things</text>
  <text start="983.779" dur="3.18">around just like the Fed is starting to</text>
  <text start="985.579" dur="3.901">turn things around and they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="986.959" dur="5.19">to point fingers now we need to</text>
  <text start="989.48" dur="5.19">understand is that the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="992.149" dur="5.071">they&amp;#39;ve been relying on soft survey</text>
  <text start="994.67" dur="5.849">based perceptions skewed by hope and</text>
  <text start="997.22" dur="6.719">expectations and of course when we look</text>
  <text start="1000.519" dur="5.461">at that we see that that was rising over</text>
  <text start="1003.939" dur="5.07">the many years but the hard real</text>
  <text start="1005.98" dur="5.75">economic data continues to decline</text>
  <text start="1009.009" dur="5.461">so Bloomberg is out there and</text>
  <text start="1011.73" dur="5.2">Bloomberg&amp;#39;s market recession model which</text>
  <text start="1014.47" dur="4.46">translates how various asset classes are</text>
  <text start="1016.93" dur="6.06">trading into recession probabilities now</text>
  <text start="1018.93" dur="7.119">flags the next recession will take place</text>
  <text start="1022.99" dur="5.969">in 12 to 24 months and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1026.049" dur="5.85">most likely it will hit in the next 12</text>
  <text start="1028.959" dur="4.681">months rather than in the 24 month time</text>
  <text start="1031.899" dur="4.68">frame so they think it&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="1033.64" dur="6.809">a lot sooner then their model is saying</text>
  <text start="1036.579" dur="6.63">and once again what is happening here is</text>
  <text start="1040.449" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re building a narrative very very</text>
  <text start="1043.209" dur="3.72">slowly and we&amp;#39;re gonna start to see</text>
  <text start="1044.919" dur="7.291">Trump and the Patriots in administration</text>
  <text start="1046.929" dur="8.521">start to change his narrative around and</text>
  <text start="1052.21" dur="6.18">talk about how the central bank the Fed</text>
  <text start="1055.45" dur="4.859">well how they are destroying the economy</text>
  <text start="1058.39" dur="3.63">and we&amp;#39;re gonna see this probably very</text>
  <text start="1060.309" dur="4.171">very slim because he&amp;#39;s running out of</text>
  <text start="1062.02" dur="5.279">time and I think he&amp;#39;s gonna start this</text>
  <text start="1064.48" dur="5.01">up very quickly maybe even during the</text>
  <text start="1067.299" dur="5.191">summer months or as we approach the fall</text>
  <text start="1069.49" dur="4.86">and once he starts to do this this is</text>
  <text start="1072.49" dur="4.59">going to be the battle because the</text>
  <text start="1074.35" dur="5.22">economy it can&amp;#39;t be pushed down the road</text>
  <text start="1077.08" dur="4.44">anymore we&amp;#39;re pretty much done at this</text>
  <text start="1079.57" dur="4.26">point and we can see that the mainstream</text>
  <text start="1081.52" dur="4.62">media they&amp;#39;re already setting up the</text>
  <text start="1083.83" dur="3.959">narrative the Fed is already setting up</text>
  <text start="1086.14" dur="3.93">the narrative and we&amp;#39;re gonna see the</text>
  <text start="1087.789" dur="5.01">Trump administration start to turn and</text>
  <text start="1090.07" dur="4.68">change its narrative on how the economy</text>

  <text start="1098.59" dur="5.25">Fed and we&amp;#39;re gonna see this happen very</text>
  <text start="1100.87" dur="4.65">soon so this system is coming down we</text>
