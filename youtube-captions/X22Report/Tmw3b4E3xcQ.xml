  <text start="485.789" dur="4.92">make it look weak you can make it do</text>
  <text start="487.459" dur="6.13">wondrous things and this is what Trump</text>
  <text start="490.709" dur="8.52">has been doing this is why the Fed right</text>
  <text start="493.589" dur="9.39">now is trapped Trump is controlling the</text>
  <text start="499.229" dur="7.53">Fed and what they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="502.979" dur="7.08">they&amp;#39;re going to use gold to bring down</text>
  <text start="506.759" dur="7.111">the Fed Q has been telling us this Q has</text>

  <text start="539.519" dur="8.82">from the dollar China right now is</text>
  <text start="545.63" dur="6.329">signaling and warning that the end of</text>
  <text start="548.339" dur="6.35">the dollar that has existed since 1971</text>
  <text start="551.959" dur="7.211">will be coming to an end</text>
  <text start="554.689" dur="6.041">gold is going to be weaponized and it</text>
  <text start="559.17" dur="3.81">looks like there&amp;#39;s a coordinated effort</text>
  <text start="560.73" dur="4.109">between Russia China and the US</text>
  <text start="562.98" dur="5.4">remember Russia and China they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="564.839" dur="5.131">accumulating a lot of gold Q&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="568.38" dur="3.99">telling us that gold is going to be used</text>
  <text start="569.97" dur="4.4">to bring down the Fed the central</text>
  <text start="572.37" dur="5.55">banking system it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>

  <text start="577.92" dur="4.44">find all this gold or there is gold</text>
  <text start="579.48" dur="7.799">someplace else but all all that has to</text>
  <text start="582.36" dur="8.43">happen is gold needs to increase in</text>
  <text start="587.279" dur="11.401">price as more and more people see gold</text>
  <text start="590.79" dur="9.899">rise 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 people will</text>
  <text start="598.68" dur="5.25">start getting out of dollars and they</text>
  <text start="600.689" dur="5.071">will move into gold and as more and more</text>
  <text start="603.93" dur="5.759">people move into gold there&amp;#39;ll be more</text>
  <text start="605.76" dur="5.429">of a demand in gold this is also an</text>
  <text start="609.689" dur="5.58">indicator that there&amp;#39;s something wrong</text>
  <text start="611.189" dur="9.301">with the paper currency because now gold</text>
  <text start="615.269" dur="8.25">is rising and what is wrong with the</text>
  <text start="620.49" dur="6.81">dollar think about what happened after</text>
  <text start="623.519" dur="5.491">2008 gold started to rise to 1900 now</text>
  <text start="627.3" dur="5.159">the Fed knew at that point in time that</text>
  <text start="629.01" dur="5.34">if gold continually rises people are</text>
  <text start="632.459" dur="5.43">gonna say we&amp;#39;ll wait a minute why is</text>
  <text start="634.35" dur="7.25">gold at 2,500 3,000 what is going on</text>
  <text start="637.889" dur="7.5">with the dollar something is wrong</text>
  <text start="641.6" dur="7.739">this is going to be used to bring down</text>

  <text start="649.339" dur="4.901">they have gold many people say there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="651.75" dur="4.769">gold someplace here in the United States</text>
  <text start="654.24" dur="6.329">maybe they even have it in Fort Knox</text>
  <text start="656.519" dur="6.601">we don&amp;#39;t know Q has hinted that gold</text>
  <text start="660.569" dur="7.051">will bring down the Fed but hasn&amp;#39;t told</text>
  <text start="663.12" dur="8.519">us where the gold is located so we can</text>
  <text start="667.62" dur="7.56">see that everything is moving in the</text>
  <text start="671.639" dur="5.291">direction of bringing down the central</text>
  <text start="675.18" dur="3.77">banking apparatus</text>
  <text start="676.93" dur="3.79">when we start to put all these pieces</text>
  <text start="678.95" dur="6.69">together think about what is happening</text>
  <text start="680.72" dur="8.4">right now out in Europe the ECB still is</text>
  <text start="685.64" dur="6.39">in the negative interest rate area they</text>
  <text start="689.12" dur="4.65">can&amp;#39;t increase it the Fed put a hold on</text>
  <text start="692.03" dur="3.69">their rate increases because they knew</text>
  <text start="693.77" dur="3.57">that if it continued to do this the</text>
  <text start="695.72" dur="3.9">economy would fall apart and trump would</text>
  <text start="697.34" dur="5.46">blame it on them trump is controlling</text>
  <text start="699.62" dur="5.1">the Fed q has told us that the Fed a</text>
  <text start="702.8" dur="3.45">deep state they were gonna try to bring</text>
  <text start="704.72" dur="4.05">down the economy in 2020</text>
  <text start="706.25" dur="4.73">it looks like Trump as of right now put</text>
  <text start="708.77" dur="6.21">a hole to all of this</text>
  <text start="710.98" dur="7.39">UK is trying to break away from the EU</text>
  <text start="714.98" dur="6.75">the central bankers well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="718.37" dur="4.53">fear-mongering and telling the UK that</text>
  <text start="721.73" dur="7.11">it would be a complete and utter</text>
  <text start="722.9" dur="8.54">disaster when the UK breaks off from the</text>
  <text start="728.84" dur="5.61">EU and let&amp;#39;s say there&amp;#39;s a no deal other</text>
  <text start="731.44" dur="3.97">countries are going to look at this and</text>

  <text start="740.54" dur="1.89">disaster</text>
  <text start="741.17" dur="3.75">now remember when they had the</text>

  <text start="775.46" dur="6.99">gold then they bring in the weapon and</text>
  <text start="779.14" dur="7.33">they use it against the central bankers</text>
  <text start="782.45" dur="6.24">because they&amp;#39;re paper currency it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="786.47" dur="5.58">backed by anything it&amp;#39;s just printed out</text>

  <text start="806.69" dur="2.98">of its value that&amp;#39;s why you see</text>
  <text start="808.49" dur="2.98">inflation</text>
  <text start="809.67" dur="4.65">not that the items are going up it means</text>
  <text start="811.47" dur="4.98">the dollar is decreasing in value you</text>
  <text start="814.32" dur="6.68">need a lot more of those dollars to pay</text>

  <text start="830.49" dur="6.9">now when gold comes into play and it</text>
  <text start="834.18" dur="5.88">takes many many dollars to buy that same</text>
  <text start="837.39" dur="6.06">ounce of gold think about it right now</text>
  <text start="840.06" dur="7.26">it takes about what 1,300 to buy that</text>
  <text start="843.45" dur="6.12">out so you need $1300 when gold moves up</text>
  <text start="847.32" dur="4.08">in price or I should say the dollar</text>
  <text start="849.57" dur="4.74">loses its value and the manipulation</text>
  <text start="851.4" dur="6.75">stops and gold is now 3000 that means it</text>
  <text start="854.31" dur="9.23">takes 3,000 more dollars to buy that</text>
  <text start="858.15" dur="8.01">same ounce and then when gold is now</text>
  <text start="863.54" dur="6.55">$4,000 per ounce that means you need an</text>
