  <text start="124.569" dur="5.91">down and now they are panicking because</text>
  <text start="127.6" dur="6.42">they see that they&amp;#39;ve pumped up the</text>
  <text start="130.479" dur="5.761">bubbles in the past they were expecting</text>
  <text start="134.02" dur="5.22">an event they didn&amp;#39;t get the event and</text>
  <text start="136.24" dur="5.49">now they&amp;#39;re very worried they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="139.24" dur="4.68">anything to happen where the entire</text>
  <text start="141.73" dur="5.04">system comes down and it is completely</text>
  <text start="143.92" dur="4.26">blamed on them they&amp;#39;re not too much</text>
  <text start="146.77" dur="3.78">worried about the United States because</text>
  <text start="148.18" dur="5.7">Trump right now he is keeping the</text>
  <text start="150.55" dur="6.18">economy going the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="153.88" dur="4.62">worried about other countries remember</text>
  <text start="156.73" dur="3.539">they&amp;#39;re completely exposed around the</text>
  <text start="158.5" dur="4.079">world and we&amp;#39;ll be getting into that in</text>
  <text start="160.269" dur="4.921">just a minute but it looks like out in</text>
  <text start="162.579" dur="6.391">the UK Theresa May</text>
  <text start="165.19" dur="5.64">well she&amp;#39;s trying once again she has her</text>
  <text start="168.97" dur="4.26">latest new brexit deal which is really</text>
  <text start="170.83" dur="5.7">the exact same thing and she&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="173.23" dur="4.56">push a second referendum we know that</text>
  <text start="176.53" dur="3.3">people have already voted they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="177.79" dur="3.54">want a second referendum they already</text>
  <text start="179.83" dur="2.94">had one referendum where they said</text>
  <text start="181.33" dur="4.2">listen we don&amp;#39;t want to be part of the</text>
  <text start="182.77" dur="3.51">EU anymore and we don&amp;#39;t care if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="185.53" dur="3.96">no deal</text>
  <text start="186.28" dur="5.7">now remember Teresa May she is working</text>
  <text start="189.49" dur="4.37">for the central bankers this is why</text>
  <text start="191.98" dur="5.04">she&amp;#39;s continually pushing their plan</text>
  <text start="193.86" dur="5.89">remember we have Nigel Ferrari and his</text>
  <text start="197.02" dur="5.43">party which is gaining ground and she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.75" dur="3.96">becoming very very nervous and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="202.45" dur="3.33">have to wait we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see</text>
  <text start="203.71" dur="5.34">how this all plays out but I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="205.78" dur="4.59">her latest push is going to work I think</text>
  <text start="209.05" dur="3.6">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="210.37" dur="5.25">she&amp;#39;s gonna resign and that will be that</text>
  <text start="212.65" dur="4.59">but again he can&amp;#39;t put anything past the</text>
  <text start="215.62" dur="4.94">central bankers because they will try</text>
  <text start="217.24" dur="6.39">anything and everything to stay in power</text>
  <text start="220.56" dur="5.44">now we were just talking about how the</text>
  <text start="223.63" dur="5.13">central banks how they are panicking</text>
  <text start="226" dur="5.58">right now and we know out in Canada the</text>
  <text start="228.76" dur="4.949">housing bubbles are something that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="231.58" dur="5.01">never seen before there they&amp;#39;re twice as</text>
  <text start="233.709" dur="5.131">large as the United States housing</text>
  <text start="236.59" dur="6.08">bubble if you look at Vancouver Toronto</text>
  <text start="238.84" dur="6.78">and many other areas within Canada it is</text>
  <text start="242.67" dur="4.66">absolutely horrific and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="245.62" dur="4.35">to see these bubbles to flate a little</text>
  <text start="247.33" dur="8.15">bit and the IMF is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="249.97" dur="8.22">urging Canada not to change anything why</text>
  <text start="255.48" dur="4.93">because they&amp;#39;re afraid the bubbles are</text>
  <text start="258.19" dur="6.21">going to pop the IMF says it would be</text>
  <text start="260.41" dur="8.97">ill-advised to stimulate activity in the</text>
  <text start="264.4" dur="7.47">housing sector they don&amp;#39;t want Canada</text>
  <text start="269.38" dur="3.87">pumping up the bubbles or doing anything</text>
  <text start="271.87" dur="3.81">to the housing market because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="273.25" dur="5.97">very nervous about what is going to</text>
  <text start="275.68" dur="7.23">happen here and we know that if the</text>
  <text start="279.22" dur="5.28">bubble does pop in Canada everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="282.91" dur="4.23">gonna be looking at the central bank who</text>
  <text start="284.5" dur="5.22">blew them up the central banks who</text>
  <text start="287.14" dur="6.24">popped them well the central banks are</text>
  <text start="289.72" dur="6.33">in control of the economy who do we turn</text>
  <text start="293.38" dur="5.49">to we turn towards the central bank now</text>
  <text start="296.05" dur="5.4">the IMF says the household debt</text>
  <text start="298.87" dur="5.19">Canada is still too high to pursue</text>
  <text start="301.45" dur="5.49">policy changes to encourage more</text>
  <text start="304.06" dur="6">activity in the housing markets I wonder</text>
  <text start="306.94" dur="6.24">why there&amp;#39;s too much debt because</text>
  <text start="310.06" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;ve been pushing debt since 2008 I</text>
  <text start="313.18" dur="6.21">mean extreme debt yes we&amp;#39;ve been pushing</text>
  <text start="316.27" dur="5.43">debt way before that but since 2008 they</text>
  <text start="319.39" dur="3.81">went off the charts by pushing debt onto</text>
  <text start="321.7" dur="3.84">every single one of these countries and</text>
  <text start="323.2" dur="4.98">remember the central bankers they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="325.54" dur="5.4">want the countries to implode they want</text>
  <text start="328.18" dur="6.06">this happy medium where they&amp;#39;re in a lot</text>
  <text start="330.94" dur="5.67">of debt they can control the country</text>
  <text start="334.24" dur="6.12">tell the country what laws they need to</text>
  <text start="336.61" dur="5.63">pass if they need to push austerity this</text>
  <text start="340.36" dur="6.48">is how they like to keep the countries</text>
  <text start="342.24" dur="7.06">right in that middle ground because if a</text>
  <text start="346.84" dur="6">country defaults or a country implodes</text>
  <text start="349.3" dur="6.93">under their debt level it goes back to</text>
  <text start="352.84" dur="6.6">them this is why they make sure that the</text>
  <text start="356.23" dur="5.66">countries do not implode this is part of</text>
  <text start="359.44" dur="5.81">their mandate make sure no country</text>
  <text start="361.89" dur="7.03">implodes on our watch because if they do</text>
  <text start="365.25" dur="8.2">all eyes are on us we want to keep them</text>
  <text start="368.92" dur="7.77">at this point where they can&amp;#39;t do better</text>
  <text start="373.45" dur="7.08">they can&amp;#39;t do worse they&amp;#39;re right in the</text>
  <text start="376.69" dur="7.68">center and we control them this is how</text>
  <text start="380.53" dur="6.9">they keep control now here in the United</text>
  <text start="384.37" dur="6.39">States the housing market is really not</text>
  <text start="387.43" dur="6.54">doing well when we look at existing home</text>
  <text start="390.76" dur="6.45">sales they have been tumbling</text>
  <text start="393.97" dur="5.52">year-over-year for 14 months Internet in</text>
  <text start="397.21" dur="5.22">a row and remember everything that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="399.49" dur="4.86">talking about Canada the IMF the housing</text>
  <text start="402.43" dur="5.1">market here in the United States this is</text>
  <text start="404.35" dur="5.64">all the central bank economy this is not</text>
  <text start="407.53" dur="5.13">Trump&amp;#39;s economy it&amp;#39;s not any other</text>
  <text start="409.99" dur="5.22">leaders economy these are the central</text>
  <text start="412.66" dur="5.37">bank economies that are imploding on</text>
  <text start="415.21" dur="4.89">themselves and when you start to look</text>
  <text start="418.03" dur="4.38">and you look at the housing market you</text>
  <text start="420.1" dur="3.24">look at retail you look at the real GDP</text>
  <text start="422.41" dur="2.85">numbers you look at the real</text>
  <text start="423.34" dur="3.69">unemployment numbers not the manipulated</text>
  <text start="425.26" dur="3.54">ones that say hey look how great</text>
  <text start="427.03" dur="3.27">everything is when you really look at</text>
  <text start="428.8" dur="3.959">that you can see the central bank system</text>
  <text start="430.3" dur="5.369">it is really falling apart</text>
  <text start="432.759" dur="8.16">Trump knows this and he&amp;#39;s been calling</text>
  <text start="435.669" dur="10.441">out to the Fed urging them to cut rates</text>
  <text start="440.919" dur="7.58">and start stimulus once again now we</text>
  <text start="446.11" dur="5.01">know that the Fed has been tightening</text>
  <text start="448.499" dur="3.91">Trump told them that they need to stop</text>
  <text start="451.12" dur="4.349">this while they&amp;#39;re gonna stop this in</text>
  <text start="452.409" dur="4.831">the fall Trump also said you can&amp;#39;t raise</text>
  <text start="455.469" dur="4.29">rates any more well they stopped raising</text>
  <text start="457.24" dur="6.229">rates Trump says well now we need you to</text>
  <text start="459.759" dur="6.96">cut rates and start stimulus now the Fed</text>
  <text start="463.469" dur="6.19">they&amp;#39;re going to start stimulus once</text>
  <text start="466.719" dur="5.01">again but they don&amp;#39;t want to come out</text>
  <text start="469.659" dur="4.44">and say and I believe this is part of</text>
  <text start="471.729" dur="3.78">the plan to make sure that the Fed is</text>
  <text start="474.099" dur="3.35">completely independent and it looks</text>
  <text start="475.509" dur="4.71">independent so no one questions anything</text>
  <text start="477.449" dur="5.921">the Fed is gonna come out with this new</text>
  <text start="480.219" dur="4.771">program as soon as next year I believe</text>
  <text start="483.37" dur="3.889">it&amp;#39;s going to be sooner than that but as</text>
  <text start="484.99" dur="4.949">soon as next year the Fed will resume</text>
  <text start="487.259" dur="7.09">large-scale buying of debt securities</text>
  <text start="489.939" dur="6.96">this time just US Treasuries in amounts</text>
  <text start="494.349" dur="7.11">that may ultimately exceed its crisis</text>
  <text start="496.899" dur="6.901">error purchases now of course the Fed is</text>
  <text start="501.459" dur="4.86">not going to call this QE they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="503.8" dur="4.94">come up with some other name this way</text>
  <text start="506.319" dur="4.981">people don&amp;#39;t realize that they are</text>
  <text start="508.74" dur="4.899">stimulating the economy once again and</text>
  <text start="511.3" dur="3.56">we need to remember there&amp;#39;s a fine line</text>
  <text start="513.639" dur="3.75">here where the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="514.86" dur="4.299">needs to make sure that the Fed looks</text>
  <text start="517.389" dur="3.481">independent this way the mainstream</text>
  <text start="519.159" dur="3.93">media the deep state and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="520.87" dur="4.23">world don&amp;#39;t say hey you are controlling</text>
  <text start="523.089" dur="5.641">the Fed and the Fed must be independent</text>
  <text start="525.1" dur="5.64">they want the Fed to look independent</text>
  <text start="528.73" dur="3.63">goodloe was out there saying listen we</text>
  <text start="530.74" dur="3.42">would like the Fed to cut rates we would</text>
  <text start="532.36" dur="3.33">like the Fed to start stimulus we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="534.16" dur="3.81">telling the Fed what to do because they</text>
  <text start="535.69" dur="4.82">are completely independent they need to</text>
  <text start="537.97" dur="5.309">keep the illusion of that they are</text>
  <text start="540.51" dur="4.99">independent and this is being done on</text>
  <text start="543.279" dur="6.571">purpose so they can go after the Fed</text>
  <text start="545.5" dur="7.829">later on now the reason why the Fed is</text>
  <text start="549.85" dur="6.349">now going to stimulate the economy it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="553.329" dur="7.771">because they need the economy to</text>
  <text start="556.199" dur="8.32">continue on the way it is so Trump can</text>
  <text start="561.1" dur="4.56">continue restructuring the economy and</text>
  <text start="564.519" dur="3.091">getting prepared</text>
  <text start="565.66" dur="4.14">for the transition now let&amp;#39;s go back to</text>
  <text start="567.61" dur="4.68">May 14th where he tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="569.8" dur="4.38">following China will be pumping money</text>
  <text start="572.29" dur="4.11">into their system and probably reducing</text>
  <text start="574.18" dur="4.77">interest rates as always in order to</text>
  <text start="576.4" dur="5.28">make up for the business they are and</text>
  <text start="578.95" dur="5.19">will be losing if the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="581.68" dur="5.81">ever did a match it would be game over</text>
  <text start="584.14" dur="6.9">we win in any event China wants a deal</text>
  <text start="587.49" dur="6.49">Trump right there is telling the Federal</text>
  <text start="591.04" dur="5.45">Reserve exactly what he wants the</text>
  <text start="593.98" dur="7.17">Federal Reserve is going to do exactly</text>
  <text start="596.49" dur="8.35">what he wants as we can see he needs the</text>
  <text start="601.15" dur="6.09">stimulus he needs the rate cuts he needs</text>
  <text start="604.84" dur="5.34">all of this to keep the economic system</text>
  <text start="607.24" dur="5.37">chugging along listening to the IMF</text>
  <text start="610.18" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re panicking right now they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="612.61" dur="4.86">want countries making drastic moves if</text>
  <text start="615.4" dur="5.37">they make drastic moves the entire</text>
  <text start="617.47" dur="6.21">system falls apart if the entire system</text>
  <text start="620.77" dur="5.21">falls apart all eyes are on them think</text>
  <text start="623.68" dur="5.82">about what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="625.98" dur="6.73">just like the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="629.5" dur="6.51">bankers they&amp;#39;re trapped they can&amp;#39;t move</text>
  <text start="632.71" dur="6.86">forward they can&amp;#39;t move back they really</text>
  <text start="636.01" dur="7.34">want a reset but they can&amp;#39;t have it and</text>
  <text start="639.57" dur="8.86">the Patriots have the central bank</text>
  <text start="643.35" dur="7.65">caught in this trap the Patriots have</text>
  <text start="648.43" dur="6.98">the deep state caught in this trap and</text>
  <text start="651" dur="7.12">there&amp;#39;s no way out and Trump is</text>
  <text start="655.41" dur="5.98">controlling it all it might not seem</text>
  <text start="658.12" dur="5.37">like he is and the Patriots are but he</text>
  <text start="661.39" dur="4.59">is controlling it I mean do you think</text>
  <text start="663.49" dur="5.34">the Federal Reserve is just doing</text>
  <text start="665.98" dur="4.14">exactly what they want to do I mean</text>
  <text start="668.83" dur="4.59">weren&amp;#39;t they raising rates</text>
  <text start="670.12" dur="6.57">weren&amp;#39;t they tightening why would they</text>
