  <text start="114.04" dur="6">three percent and we have to watch this</text>
  <text start="117.7" dur="4.529">very carefully because we understand</text>
  <text start="120.04" dur="3.42">that Greece is completely bankrupt we</text>
  <text start="122.229" dur="5.401">understand people are going to be</text>
  <text start="123.46" dur="6.57">selling off we understand that Greece at</text>
  <text start="127.63" dur="5.579">this point in time we don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="130.03" dur="5.58">these bailout talks will go through</text>
  <text start="133.209" dur="3.931">right now the IMF says they&amp;#39;re sitting</text>
  <text start="135.61" dur="4.95">on the sidelines other reports are</text>
  <text start="137.14" dur="6.06">saying no they are working with Greece</text>
  <text start="140.56" dur="5.58">but we understand they want a debt</text>
  <text start="143.2" dur="4.86">haircut because they know Greece will</text>
  <text start="146.14" dur="5.7">completely collapse with all this debt</text>
  <text start="148.06" dur="6.32">they cannot make it and this is why</text>
  <text start="151.84" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re pushing for a dead haircut I</text>
  <text start="154.38" dur="5.859">mean think about it more austerity on</text>
  <text start="157.15" dur="5.13">the people people not working people</text>
  <text start="160.239" dur="4.051">closing down their businesses stores</text>
  <text start="162.28" dur="5.34">people aren&amp;#39;t shopping</text>
  <text start="164.29" dur="6.899">it&amp;#39;s a complete disaster now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="167.62" dur="5.61">talking about the eurozone and how it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="171.189" dur="4.321">really not in a recovery we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="173.23" dur="4.349">talking how talking about how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="175.51" dur="4.319">saying that yes look we see</text>
  <text start="177.579" dur="4.44">manufacturing picking up inflation&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="179.829" dur="4.53">under control we see that the</text>
  <text start="182.019" dur="5.401">unemployment rate around the eurozone is</text>
  <text start="184.359" dur="6.63">doing better and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="187.42" dur="4.709">S&amp;amp;P comes out just like they did with</text>
  <text start="190.989" dur="2.491">the United States and of course the</text>
  <text start="192.129" dur="3.81">United States sued them when they</text>
  <text start="193.48" dur="6.69">downgraded them but they came out and</text>
  <text start="195.939" dur="10.681">they said the European Union outlook is</text>
  <text start="200.17" dur="10.83">now revised to negative from stable so</text>
  <text start="206.62" dur="7.009">they&amp;#39;re indicating there is a problem in</text>
  <text start="211" dur="6.81">the eurozone now we knew this all along</text>
  <text start="213.629" dur="8.321">we knew the eurozone is completely</text>
  <text start="217.81" dur="11.34">imploding on itself now I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="221.95" dur="9.539">surprised if the European leaders of the</text>
  <text start="229.15" dur="5.429">eurozone who are an elective they might</text>
  <text start="231.489" dur="5.851">maybe raid the SP offices they might</text>
  <text start="234.579" dur="4.981">start litigation they&amp;#39;re going to deny</text>
  <text start="237.34" dur="7.92">all of this just like the United States</text>
  <text start="239.56" dur="10.769">did but this tells us at this point in</text>
  <text start="245.26" dur="9.92">time there are major major problems in</text>
  <text start="250.329" dur="7.62">the eurozone no matter what they say</text>
  <text start="255.18" dur="5.38">they can tell us they&amp;#39;re recovering but</text>
  <text start="257.949" dur="4.831">when we look at the actual data yes they</text>
  <text start="260.56" dur="4.829">tell us the unemployment at 11.1 percent</text>
  <text start="262.78" dur="4.65">but the thing is the unemployment</text>
  <text start="265.389" dur="4.921">numbers are continually moving up very</text>
  <text start="267.43" dur="5.64">slowly but they&amp;#39;re moving up 31,000</text>
  <text start="270.31" dur="5.55">people the last time it wasn&amp;#39;t enough to</text>
  <text start="273.07" dur="4.349">push it to 11.2 percent but the amount</text>
  <text start="275.86" dur="3.6">of people that can that are continually</text>
  <text start="277.419" dur="3.93">losing their jobs it&amp;#39;s continually</text>
  <text start="279.46" dur="4.92">ticking up the same with youth</text>
  <text start="281.349" dur="4.831">unemployment here in the United States</text>
  <text start="284.38" dur="3.42">and around the world we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="286.18" dur="5.609">layoffs or continue now we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="7.5">oil prices being pushed down once again</text>
  <text start="291.789" dur="5.13">now this is to hurt Russia because what</text>
  <text start="295.3" dur="3.36">we have to understand at this point is</text>
  <text start="296.919" dur="3.781">that the United States</text>
  <text start="298.66" dur="4.41">government central bankers are doing</text>
  <text start="300.7" dur="5.46">this to put pressure on Russia to get</text>
  <text start="303.07" dur="6.63">out of Ukraine and out of Syria but what</text>
  <text start="306.16" dur="6.21">we&amp;#39;re seeing around the world right now</text>
  <text start="309.7" dur="4.8">is a lot of companies are starting to</text>
  <text start="312.37" dur="3.72">lay off I mean we see and we understand</text>
  <text start="314.5" dur="5.43">because we mentioned this before shell</text>
  <text start="316.09" dur="6.39">is laying off 6,500 people British</text>
  <text start="319.93" dur="5.96">utility centrica is laying off 6,000</text>
  <text start="322.48" dur="9.5">jobs we know Chevron is 1,500 saipem</text>
  <text start="325.89" dur="8.37">8800 you novita of Florida 1,000 people</text>
  <text start="331.98" dur="7.38">Roberts Hawaii a hundred and to</text>
  <text start="334.26" dur="11.37">Southeast homecare 217 Walter Energy 545</text>
  <text start="339.36" dur="11.52">Ingram Micro 540 its continuing non-stop</text>
  <text start="345.63" dur="9.82">and as more and more people are laid off</text>
  <text start="350.88" dur="6.76">where are they going to find work it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="355.45" dur="4.41">going to be very very difficult to find</text>
  <text start="357.64" dur="3.99">work and we can see at this point in</text>
  <text start="359.86" dur="3.06">time the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="361.63" dur="5.25">they have to manipulate all the</text>
  <text start="362.92" dur="6.18">calculations because none of it makes</text>
  <text start="366.88" dur="4.68">sense anymore I mean initial jobless</text>
  <text start="369.1" dur="6.75">claims manipulated unemployment</text>
  <text start="371.56" dur="7.68">manipulated GDP manipulated inflation</text>
  <text start="375.85" dur="7.35">manipulated but we can see from the data</text>
  <text start="379.24" dur="6.78">right now the people are not spending</text>
  <text start="383.2" dur="4.5">their money out in retail they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="386.02" dur="3.45">spending their money in auto sales</text>
  <text start="387.7" dur="7.41">they&amp;#39;re not spending their money in</text>
  <text start="389.47" dur="7.56">homes purchasing new homes I mean</text>
  <text start="395.11" dur="5.94">personal spending only rose about point</text>
  <text start="397.03" dur="10.68">two percent but this is the slowest</text>
  <text start="401.05" dur="9.24">growth since februari now we have to</text>
  <text start="407.71" dur="4.74">remember they&amp;#39;re telling us that auto</text>
  <text start="410.29" dur="6.93">sales are fantastic home sales are</text>
  <text start="412.45" dur="8.73">incredible retail is just fine then why</text>
  <text start="417.22" dur="7.83">don&amp;#39;t we see the spending it should be</text>
  <text start="421.18" dur="5.79">way up and the only reason it ticked up</text>
  <text start="425.05" dur="4.399">a little bit is because gas prices moved</text>
  <text start="426.97" dur="6.349">up a little bit</text>
  <text start="429.449" dur="5.43">if people are spending their money that</text>
  <text start="433.319" dur="3.21">means they&amp;#39;re buying goods if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="434.879" dur="5.611">buying goods that means the</text>
  <text start="436.529" dur="7.38">manufacturers are producing but we see</text>
  <text start="440.49" dur="7.289">the ISF manufacturing data has come out</text>
  <text start="443.909" dur="9.9">and it dropped it&amp;#39;s down from 53.5 to</text>
  <text start="447.779" dur="8.64">52.7 in july how can this be and of</text>
  <text start="453.809" dur="7.621">course it missed expectation this is the</text>
  <text start="456.419" dur="7.141">weakest since march of this year so what</text>
  <text start="461.43" dur="5.459">we had was a complete decline of</text>
  <text start="463.56" dur="6.419">manufacturing from about September of</text>
  <text start="466.889" dur="6.601">last year up until March then we had a</text>
  <text start="469.979" dur="5.101">small increase of manufacturing and here</text>
  <text start="473.49" dur="5.699">we are back down so that was a dead cat</text>
  <text start="475.08" dur="5.519">bounce and of course the automobile</text>
  <text start="479.189" dur="4.41">makers are out there telling us that</text>
  <text start="480.599" dur="5.94">everything is fantastic auto sales are</text>
  <text start="483.599" dur="7.47">incredible and of course as we know auto</text>
  <text start="486.539" dur="6.66">sales gas sales all push up retail but</text>
  <text start="491.069" dur="3.93">the thing is when we look at this very</text>
  <text start="493.199" dur="4.2">closely and of course the corporate</text>
  <text start="494.999" dur="5.97">media is making a very big deal that you</text>
  <text start="497.399" dur="6.99">know GM is on fire their sales are out</text>
  <text start="500.969" dur="5.37">of this world it&amp;#39;s incredible and we see</text>
  <text start="504.389" dur="3.77">that yes they&amp;#39;re saying that sales have</text>
  <text start="506.339" dur="6.18">jumped by six point four percent</text>
  <text start="508.159" dur="8.23">compared to a year earlier well how can</text>
  <text start="512.519" dur="5.64">this be because we see the numbers we</text>
  <text start="516.389" dur="3.5">know people aren&amp;#39;t spending we know</text>
  <text start="518.159" dur="5.61">people are being laid off</text>
  <text start="519.889" dur="8.231">Manufacturing&amp;#39;s down so what caused the</text>
  <text start="523.769" dur="8.221">jump in auto sales well when you look at</text>
  <text start="528.12" dur="8.969">this very closely you kind of see where</text>
  <text start="531.99" dur="10.43">it&amp;#39;s all coming from we see that the</text>
  <text start="537.089" dur="11.391">private purchasing of automobiles</text>
  <text start="542.42" dur="11.08">declined where do we see the purchasing</text>
  <text start="548.48" dur="8.549">we see it from the government the</text>
  <text start="553.5" dur="8.04">government itself is buying the GM cars</text>
  <text start="557.029" dur="5.801">hand over fist so basically what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="561.54" dur="3.54">doing they&amp;#39;re saying okay</text>
  <text start="562.83" dur="5.64">we see the sales or declining we better</text>
  <text start="565.08" dur="5.28">ramp up our purchasing now does the</text>
  <text start="568.47" dur="3.66">government really have the money to</text>
  <text start="570.36" dur="5.19">purchase these automobiles now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="572.13" dur="7.76">borrowing it fleet deliveries in July</text>
  <text start="575.55" dur="4.34">we&amp;#39;re down twenty percent year-over-year</text>
  <text start="580.52" dur="9.36">we see reduced sales in rental customers</text>
  <text start="585.9" dur="6.75">and commercial sales are also down</text>
  <text start="589.88" dur="6.55">government sales were up thirty-eight</text>
  <text start="592.65" dur="5.55">percent with deliveries to state and</text>
  <text start="596.43" dur="5.58">local governments of fifty-nine percent</text>
  <text start="598.2" dur="7.35">all the sales are coming from the</text>
  <text start="602.01" dur="8.22">government they&amp;#39;re not coming from the</text>
  <text start="605.55" dur="7.65">everyday person why is that because the</text>
  <text start="610.23" dur="4.77">everyday person is tapped out they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="613.2" dur="5.97">losing their jobs they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="615" dur="5.64">part-time work their credit is bad it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="619.17" dur="2.76">getting harder and harder to get by a</text>
  <text start="620.64" dur="4.47">car because they know they can&amp;#39;t afford</text>
  <text start="621.93" dur="5.55">it so the government is taking up the</text>
  <text start="625.11" dur="4.23">slack I mean if you look at the housing</text>
  <text start="627.48" dur="4.53">industry isn&amp;#39;t it really the same thing</text>
  <text start="629.34" dur="6.21">the people aren&amp;#39;t out there purchasing</text>
  <text start="632.01" dur="6.33">the homes so they have investment</text>
  <text start="635.55" dur="5.19">companies hedge funds taking the free</text>
  <text start="638.34" dur="4.8">money from the central bank and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="640.74" dur="5.7">purchasing the homes by the thousands</text>
  <text start="643.14" dur="5.67">holding on to them to drive prices up</text>
  <text start="646.44" dur="3.9">and we&amp;#39;re seeing prices are coming down</text>
  <text start="648.81" dur="4.08">you know something I just spoke to</text>
  <text start="650.34" dur="3.87">someone today who&amp;#39;s putting their house</text>
  <text start="652.89" dur="3.09">up for sale because they thought they</text>
  <text start="654.21" dur="3.99">thought this was the best time to sell</text>
  <text start="655.98" dur="4.8">their house and their house has been on</text>
  <text start="658.2" dur="5.33">the market for four weeks now people</text>
  <text start="660.78" dur="5.1">have come and taken a look no offers and</text>
  <text start="663.53" dur="4.15">the real estate agent is saying you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="665.88" dur="3.63">going to have to lower the price why why</text>
  <text start="667.68" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t we have to lower this is a an</text>
  <text start="669.51" dur="3.48">extremely incredible market well because</text>
  <text start="671.88" dur="2.79">you haven&amp;#39;t received any offers and</text>
  <text start="672.99" dur="3.09">that&amp;#39;s really the rule of thumb in about</text>
  <text start="674.67" dur="3.15">three to four weeks if you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="676.08" dur="4.59">gotten any type of offer you lower the</text>
  <text start="677.82" dur="6.6">price and now they are starting the</text>
  <text start="680.67" dur="5.19">process they&amp;#39;re chasing the market the</text>
  <text start="684.42" dur="3.42">lower the price that people are going to</text>
  <text start="685.86" dur="4.32">come and look and take and wait to see</text>
  <text start="687.84" dur="5.49">if the price goes down even further we</text>
  <text start="690.18" dur="5.64">experience this back in 2007 going into</text>
  <text start="693.33" dur="5.25">2008 the same thing is happening right</text>
  <text start="695.82" dur="4.53">now people are going to chase the market</text>
  <text start="698.58" dur="4.35">and people say who cares about real</text>
  <text start="700.35" dur="5.69">estate well I hate to say this but real</text>
  <text start="702.93" dur="6.63">estate here when it collapses this is</text>
  <text start="706.04" dur="6.55">basically a indicator of how the economy</text>
  <text start="709.56" dur="4.65">is doing because if people have work and</text>
  <text start="712.59" dur="3.09">they have good jobs and they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="714.21" dur="2.94">the money and they have good credit they</text>
  <text start="715.68" dur="4.29">go out and they take out a mortgage and</text>
  <text start="717.15" dur="8.01">they buy a house but we&amp;#39;re not seeing</text>
  <text start="719.97" dur="8.4">this we&amp;#39;re seeing the opposite we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="725.16" dur="7.19">seeing the central bank&amp;#39;s create this</text>

  <text start="842.85" dur="6.9">going to see a nine percent cut in their</text>
  <text start="846.48" dur="6.06">GDP now you have to remember the IMF is</text>
  <text start="849.75" dur="4.709">always wrong in their predictions</text>
  <text start="852.54" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re never on target whatsoever</text>
  <text start="854.459" dur="5.69">they&amp;#39;re saying this and they&amp;#39;re using it</text>
  <text start="857.58" dur="4.949">for propaganda purposes that&amp;#39;s about it</text>
  <text start="860.149" dur="6.551">but what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>

  <text start="879.6" dur="4.2">bringing in the illegals to take up the</text>
  <text start="881.73" dur="5.609">slack because they need the low paying</text>
  <text start="883.8" dur="6.51">jobs filled they need people with no</text>
  <text start="887.339" dur="7.261">credit to come in here so they can get</text>
  <text start="890.31" dur="9.32">credit to purchase automobiles to</text>
  <text start="894.6" dur="8.609">purchase homes to go on health insurance</text>

  <text start="905.76" dur="4.949">$3,000 penalty on Obamacare and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="909.18" dur="4.11">very interesting about all this because</text>
  <text start="910.709" dur="6.121">we know Obama is continually tweaking</text>
  <text start="913.29" dur="5.13">his memorandum about immigration how</text>
  <text start="916.83" dur="3.21">once they come over the border they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="918.42" dur="4.68">in this country they get work permits</text>
  <text start="920.04" dur="5.549">and they&amp;#39;re sent off we are seeing now</text>
  <text start="923.1" dur="6.45">that the u.s. is going to issue more</text>
  <text start="925.589" dur="6.831">green cards then the populations of Iowa</text>

  <text start="937.23" dur="6.12">us the American people are tapped out</text>
  <text start="939.45" dur="8.73">and they need fresh blood here in the US</text>
  <text start="943.35" dur="7.95">to keep this system going because this</text>
  <text start="948.18" dur="5.34">is part of their agenda and this is why</text>
  <text start="951.3" dur="4.71">they want these people coming into the</text>
  <text start="953.52" dur="5.37">United States because as soon as they</text>
  <text start="956.01" dur="6.93">cross they get a working permit once</text>

  <text start="965.089" dur="8.471">they get benefits from the government</text>
  <text start="968.779" dur="7.06">because look at this when a foreign</text>
  <text start="973.56" dur="5.16">citizen is issued a green card it</text>
  <text start="975.839" dur="5.271">guarantees them the following benefits</text>
