  <text start="38.42" dur="4.92">twentieth 2015 and the title this</text>
  <text start="41.03" dur="5.25">episode is the current economic collapse</text>
  <text start="43.34" dur="4.38">news brief now before I begin I just</text>
  <text start="46.28" dur="3.66">want to thank those people who donated</text>
  <text start="47.72" dur="3.839">to the x 22 report com site I do</text>
  <text start="49.94" dur="3.75">appreciate it thank you very much i am</text>
  <text start="51.559" dur="4.981">very grateful for the donations thank</text>
  <text start="53.69" dur="8.28">you let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="56.54" dur="8.22">news now grease is on the verge of a</text>
  <text start="61.97" dur="5.189">bank holiday and we see the ECB they</text>
  <text start="64.76" dur="6.27">have agreed to lift the ELA cap by about</text>
  <text start="67.159" dur="5.28">1.8 billion euros and this is for less</text>
  <text start="71.03" dur="3.9">than the Greek banking officials have</text>
  <text start="72.439" dur="5.211">requested and probably just barely</text>
  <text start="74.93" dur="5.16">enough to cover the withdrawals that</text>
  <text start="77.65" dur="5.17">everyone is making at this time when we</text>
  <text start="80.09" dur="5.22">see ATM lines right now are forming</text>
  <text start="82.82" dur="5.729">people are coming taking their money out</text>
  <text start="85.31" dur="5.55">because they understand that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="88.549" dur="4.11">going to be Cyprus very soon and they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="90.86" dur="3.21">rather have the money then have the</text>
  <text start="92.659" dur="3.511">banks have the money so this is why</text>
  <text start="94.07" dur="5.75">we&amp;#39;re seeing billions of dollars being</text>
  <text start="96.17" dur="6.9">withdrawn from the Greek banks and again</text>
  <text start="99.82" dur="6.85">we&amp;#39;ve heard from sources that either</text>
  <text start="103.07" dur="5.52">this weekend or next weekend something</text>
  <text start="106.67" dur="3.809">is definitely going to happen with a</text>
  <text start="108.59" dur="5.37">bank holiday they&amp;#39;re going to implement</text>
  <text start="110.479" dur="6.18">capital controls and we see this on the</text>
  <text start="113.96" dur="5.82">horizon now we understand that Putin has</text>
  <text start="116.659" dur="6.991">made a deal with Greece they signed the</text>
  <text start="119.78" dur="7.91">agreement it&amp;#39;s a two billion euro deal</text>
  <text start="123.65" dur="9.149">and he is saying that this now allows</text>
  <text start="127.69" dur="8.439">Greece to make the payments to the</text>
  <text start="132.799" dur="5.391">eurozone if the UL if the EU wants</text>
  <text start="136.129" dur="5.67">Greece to pay its debt then it should be</text>
  <text start="138.19" dur="6.189">interested in the Greek economy Putin</text>
  <text start="141.799" dur="6.091">said the EU should be applauding us</text>
  <text start="144.379" dur="8.911">what&amp;#39;s bad about creating new jobs in</text>
  <text start="147.89" dur="7.53">Greece nothing&amp;#39;s bad about it it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="153.29" dur="5.55">that the central bank&amp;#39;s this is not what</text>
  <text start="155.42" dur="6.51">they do debt is their product if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="158.84" dur="5.55">not in debt they don&amp;#39;t make money this</text>
  <text start="161.93" dur="4.47">is why they like the austerity</text>
  <text start="164.39" dur="3.99">this is why they want the countries that</text>
  <text start="166.4" dur="3.54">continually take on debt because if</text>
  <text start="168.38" dur="4.14">everyone was working in the economies</text>
  <text start="169.94" dur="5.76">we&amp;#39;re doing well these countries would</text>
  <text start="172.52" dur="4.71">not have the debt they have and if they</text>
  <text start="175.7" dur="4.68">had a balanced budget it would be even</text>
  <text start="177.23" dur="6.42">worse they wouldn&amp;#39;t be making their</text>
  <text start="180.38" dur="5.37">money and the central bankers love to</text>
  <text start="183.65" dur="3.78">place these countries into debt because</text>
  <text start="185.75" dur="4.65">what do they really do they create this</text>
  <text start="187.43" dur="5.66">money out of thin air they loan it to a</text>
  <text start="190.4" dur="5.73">country and then they steal the real</text>
  <text start="193.09" dur="5.5">resources from the country and this is</text>
  <text start="196.13" dur="6.12">what we are seeing and we understand</text>
  <text start="198.59" dur="6.869">that Greece has been invited to join the</text>
  <text start="202.25" dur="4.98">bricks system and the bricks new</text>
  <text start="205.459" dur="3.631">Development Bank will be launched at the</text>
  <text start="207.23" dur="5.97">first session of its board of governors</text>
  <text start="209.09" dur="5.42">in Moscow July seventh the new</text>
  <text start="213.2" dur="3.66">Development Bank will provide a</text>
  <text start="214.51" dur="5.86">financing alternative to the World Bank</text>
  <text start="216.86" dur="7.77">and this will allow the emerging</text>
  <text start="220.37" dur="5.339">economies to have a say in what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="224.63" dur="4.169">on because you have to remember back in</text>
  <text start="225.709" dur="5.401">2010 the u.s. promise that they will</text>
  <text start="228.799" dur="4.831">give they would give more voting rights</text>
  <text start="231.11" dur="5.129">to the emerging economies and the United</text>
  <text start="233.63" dur="5.609">States actually went back on their word</text>
  <text start="236.239" dur="5.761">and they&amp;#39;re keeping all the voting</text>
  <text start="239.239" dur="5.461">rights in the IMF and this is why the</text>
  <text start="242" dur="5.79">emerging economies decided to get</text>
  <text start="244.7" dur="5.55">together and put together this bank to</text>
  <text start="247.79" dur="5.87">rival the IMF and this is what we are</text>
  <text start="250.25" dur="6.09">seeing right now and we understand that</text>
  <text start="253.66" dur="5.29">the US government central bankers they</text>
  <text start="256.34" dur="6.93">are continually pushing the TPP the TTIP</text>
  <text start="258.95" dur="5.82">the the other trade agreements and</text>
  <text start="263.27" dur="4.5">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="264.77" dur="5.43">people in Europe they understand that</text>
  <text start="267.77" dur="4.17">this is not good for them they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="270.2" dur="3.93">protesting out there they&amp;#39;re telling</text>
  <text start="271.94" dur="3.69">people you know this is not going to</text>
  <text start="274.13" dur="4.17">benefit the people here in the United</text>
  <text start="275.63" dur="4.32">States those who are awake realize that</text>
  <text start="278.3" dur="4.05">this is not going to benefit the people</text>
  <text start="279.95" dur="4.38">it is going to benefit the corporation</text>
  <text start="282.35" dur="4.319">the banks and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="284.33" dur="4.83">pushing it so hard this is why it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="286.669" dur="5.281">secret but there was a poll done in</text>
  <text start="289.16" dur="5.189">Canada and the majority of Canadians</text>
  <text start="291.95" dur="4.83">don&amp;#39;t know that their government is</text>
  <text start="294.349" dur="3.121">negotiating with 11 other countries in</text>
  <text start="296.78" dur="3.24">one of the biggest</text>
  <text start="297.47" dur="6.75">international free trade deals known as</text>
  <text start="300.02" dur="6.06">the trans-pacific partnership and this</text>
  <text start="304.22" dur="3.6">is very interesting that they really</text>
  <text start="306.08" dur="3.78">don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s going on because</text>
  <text start="307.82" dur="4.41">a lot of the country&amp;#39;s the people do</text>
  <text start="309.86" dur="4.98">know what&amp;#39;s going on and I would have to</text>
  <text start="312.23" dur="4.59">say this is probably the same here in</text>
  <text start="314.84" dur="4.68">the united states i would say about 75%</text>
  <text start="316.82" dur="5.55">of the people here in the US really</text>
  <text start="319.52" dur="5.49">don&amp;#39;t know what the TPP is or the TTIP</text>
  <text start="322.37" dur="3.99">or the other trade agreements and most</text>
  <text start="325.01" dur="3.6">of them don&amp;#39;t care because they&amp;#39;re too</text>
  <text start="326.36" dur="4.98">busy doing other things and worrying</text>
  <text start="328.61" dur="4.47">about other things than worrying about</text>
  <text start="331.34" dur="3.63">what&amp;#39;s really going on in this country</text>
  <text start="333.08" dur="3.48">and this is what we are seeing now not</text>
  <text start="334.97" dur="4.88">saying it&amp;#39;s everyone but those people</text>
  <text start="336.56" dur="5.82">who are awake are following this along</text>
  <text start="339.85" dur="4.33">those people who are believing the</text>
  <text start="342.38" dur="4.14">corporate media and the president who</text>
  <text start="344.18" dur="5.94">say this is to benefit the people this</text>
  <text start="346.52" dur="8.22">is for you they have no idea what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="350.12" dur="6.54">really about now out in Ukraine things</text>
  <text start="354.74" dur="3.51">are really ramping up there we see the</text>
  <text start="356.66" dur="7.2">ukrainian security service as frozen</text>
  <text start="358.25" dur="7.8">about 250 ATMs across da nang scanned</text>
  <text start="363.86" dur="4.41">lugansk so people cannot withdraw their</text>
  <text start="366.05" dur="4.8">money the security service said that the</text>
  <text start="368.27" dur="6.54">ATMs have been blocked as their owners</text>
  <text start="370.85" dur="5.7">pay taxes to the dpr and the LPR so</text>
  <text start="374.81" dur="5.54">people right now cannot take out money</text>
  <text start="376.55" dur="7.47">in those areas and we see the IMF in</text>
  <text start="380.35" dur="6.129">Ukraine pledges to support Ukraine even</text>
  <text start="384.02" dur="4.68">if no agreement with creditors are on</text>
  <text start="386.479" dur="5.101">time it makes no difference we will</text>
  <text start="388.7" dur="5.1">continually put Ukraine into debt and of</text>
  <text start="391.58" dur="4.29">course they&amp;#39;re taking orders from the US</text>
  <text start="393.8" dur="6.66">government central bankers to keep</text>
  <text start="395.87" dur="6.54">Ukraine chugging along here they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="400.46" dur="4.05">want them to default they want to make</text>
  <text start="402.41" dur="3.569">sure they can get this war started so</text>
  <text start="404.51" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re continually putting them into</text>
  <text start="405.979" dur="3.631">that even though the economy is</text>
  <text start="407.63" dur="5.49">completely failing their currency is</text>
  <text start="409.61" dur="6.809">declining GDP is in double negative</text>
  <text start="413.12" dur="6.99">digits at this time and it is not</text>
  <text start="416.419" dur="6.451">getting better but we see the US State</text>
  <text start="420.11" dur="5.88">Department is continuing with the</text>
  <text start="422.87" dur="4.59">propaganda they&amp;#39;re saying that it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="425.99" dur="4.29">difficult to achieve a political</text>
  <text start="427.46" dur="3.48">solution in Ukraine because there are</text>
  <text start="430.28" dur="5.42">how</text>
  <text start="430.94" dur="8.01">of Russian forces inside the country and</text>
  <text start="435.7" dur="4.51">Kirby spoke after Putin cold on the</text>
  <text start="438.95" dur="4.47">United States and other Western powers</text>
  <text start="440.21" dur="5.04">to put pressure on Kiev to resolve the</text>
  <text start="443.42" dur="4.35">conflict in each in East Ukraine because</text>
  <text start="445.25" dur="5.94">right now Kiev is continually violating</text>
  <text start="447.77" dur="5.55">the mints to agreement Kiev is supposed</text>
  <text start="451.19" dur="4.68">to abide by a lot of the steps and they</text>
  <text start="453.32" dur="5.67">haven&amp;#39;t there&amp;#39;s no penalties there is</text>
  <text start="455.87" dur="4.44">nothing with Kiev because as we know the</text>
  <text start="458.99" dur="4.47">United States government the central</text>
  <text start="460.31" dur="5.16">bankers they support them they want war</text>
  <text start="463.46" dur="4.71">they want the southeastern section back</text>
  <text start="465.47" dur="4.77">they want Crimea back and this is why</text>
  <text start="468.17" dur="7.55">they really don&amp;#39;t care about the mints</text>
  <text start="470.24" dur="9.63">to agreement actually it&amp;#39;s an illusion</text>
  <text start="475.72" dur="5.44">showing Kiev is following along with the</text>
  <text start="479.87" dur="3.09">mints to agreement but they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="481.16" dur="3.72">not they&amp;#39;re just out there putting out</text>
  <text start="482.96" dur="4.11">propaganda saying yes we agree with the</text>
  <text start="484.88" dur="3.48">men&amp;#39;s to yes and it seems that every</text>
  <text start="487.07" dur="4.56">time they&amp;#39;re supposed to do something</text>
  <text start="488.36" dur="6.99">they actually don&amp;#39;t we see Ukraine is</text>
  <text start="491.63" dur="6.45">upgrading the an-26 aircraft for combat</text>

  <text start="508.7" dur="5.279">shelling from portable surface-to-air</text>
  <text start="510.65" dur="7.23">missile systems and they have increased</text>
  <text start="513.979" dur="7.021">the pace of work related to these planes</text>
  <text start="517.88" dur="4.469">to go after the terrorists in the</text>
  <text start="521" dur="3.09">southeastern region and what they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="524.09" dur="4.59">after the people in the southeastern</text>

  <text start="532.58" dur="6.6">improving their military assets and</text>
  <text start="535.21" dur="6.46">they&amp;#39;re getting ready to make a major</text>
  <text start="539.18" dur="5.97">offensive in the southeastern area we</text>
  <text start="541.67" dur="5.52">see John McCain right now and he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="558.89" dur="4.29">States to go after the people in the</text>
  <text start="561.56" dur="2.939">southeastern region because they are</text>
  <text start="563.18" dur="3.749">terrorists</text>

  <text start="566.929" dur="7.02">the puppet government Ukraine set John</text>
  <text start="570.589" dur="6.42">McCain says Ukraine will be able to</text>
  <text start="573.949" dur="7.31">depend on the United States to supply</text>
  <text start="577.009" dur="7.38">gas to Ukraine so they can come off of</text>
  <text start="581.259" dur="5.26">Russia completely so he&amp;#39;s saying within</text>
  <text start="584.389" dur="5.7">the next two years they will completely</text>
  <text start="586.519" dur="5.4">be independent of Russia and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="590.089" dur="3.96">that Europe will be completely</text>
  <text start="591.919" dur="4.74">independent of Russia I don&amp;#39;t see that</text>
  <text start="594.049" dur="7.14">happening right now we see the Turkish</text>
  <text start="596.659" dur="6.57">stream being built we see Russia has</text>
  <text start="601.189" dur="4.68">made a deal with Germany to go across</text>
  <text start="603.229" dur="5.31">the Baltic Sea to supply Germany with</text>
  <text start="605.869" dur="5.94">gas so I don&amp;#39;t see this actually</text>
  <text start="608.539" dur="6.63">happening now I just want to touch upon</text>
  <text start="611.809" dur="5.34">this Charleston shooting and right now</text>
  <text start="615.169" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re out there talking about</text>
  <text start="617.149" dur="4.56">Charleston shooting and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="619.159" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s an act of domestic terrorism so</text>
  <text start="621.709" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re jinnan this up right now saying</text>
  <text start="623.749" dur="5.7">that this is a terrorist type of an</text>
  <text start="626.779" dur="5.04">attack but what&amp;#39;s very interesting about</text>
  <text start="629.449" dur="4.04">all of this and all of a sudden we see</text>
  <text start="631.819" dur="5.25">all this information coming out about</text>
  <text start="633.489" dur="6.25">Dylan roof and the FBI of course is</text>
  <text start="637.069" dur="5.1">involved because we know when the FBI is</text>
  <text start="639.739" dur="5.19">involved they have these patsies again</text>
  <text start="642.169" dur="5.28">Dylan was arrested before he was on some</text>
  <text start="644.929" dur="5.73">type of medication he might have made a</text>
  <text start="647.449" dur="5.93">deal with the FBI in some way somehow or</text>
  <text start="650.659" dur="5.61">they were using him in a certain way and</text>
  <text start="653.379" dur="5.83">continually fed him information but the</text>
  <text start="656.269" dur="6">FBI is investigating a website that</text>
  <text start="659.209" dur="5.7">appears to contain a manifesto by Dylan</text>
  <text start="662.269" dur="7.47">roof now first of all I went to the</text>
  <text start="664.909" dur="8.22">website and the website is called last</text>
  <text start="669.739" dur="6.78">Rhodesian and what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="673.129" dur="7.29">about this is I did a couple of checks</text>
  <text start="676.519" dur="8.16">here and the domain was created on</text>
  <text start="680.419" dur="6.98">februari 9 2015 and it is private so we</text>
  <text start="684.679" dur="6.6">don&amp;#39;t know who actually created it and</text>
  <text start="687.399" dur="5.77">then i use google and i wanted to see</text>
  <text start="691.279" dur="3.81">how many pages were on the website and</text>
  <text start="693.169" dur="4.811">it looks like only two pages were</text>
  <text start="695.089" dur="7.511">crawled the home page</text>
  <text start="697.98" dur="7.65">and the text document which is his</text>
  <text start="702.6" dur="4.92">manifesto which allegedly is a manifesto</text>
  <text start="705.63" dur="3.93">because we really don&amp;#39;t know if it was</text>
  <text start="707.52" dur="5.46">really him that wrote it how did it get</text>
  <text start="709.56" dur="6.06">on there and then I went to the Wayback</text>
  <text start="712.98" dur="6.06">Machine to see okay the domain was</text>
  <text start="715.62" dur="6.6">created on februari 9th the Wayback</text>
  <text start="719.04" dur="6.3">Machine should have snapshots of the</text>
  <text start="722.22" dur="6.45">website and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="725.34" dur="4.44">that from februari ninth when the domain</text>
  <text start="728.67" dur="3.3">was created that doesn&amp;#39;t mean the</text>
  <text start="729.78" dur="5.82">website was created there has been</text>
  <text start="731.97" dur="8.27">nothing until June twentieth five</text>
  <text start="735.6" dur="11.04">snapshots were created of the website on</text>
  <text start="740.24" dur="9.99">June twentieth of this year now the text</text>
  <text start="746.64" dur="7.08">document you know talks about racism</text>
  <text start="750.23" dur="5.8">about what he&amp;#39;s going to do now of</text>
  <text start="753.72" dur="5.94">course there&amp;#39;s no name attached to this</text>
  <text start="756.03" dur="6.51">it&amp;#39;s just a plain text document very</text>
  <text start="759.66" dur="5.55">hard to trace where the original came</text>
  <text start="762.54" dur="5.79">from and if he is arrested how did it</text>
  <text start="765.21" dur="5.64">get on this site and the question is</text>
  <text start="768.33" dur="4.65">there&amp;#39;s also photos of him and again I</text>
  <text start="770.85" dur="5.28">have to say a lot of these photos look</text>
  <text start="772.98" dur="5.4">staged who took the photos did he saw it</text>
  <text start="776.13" dur="5.78">did he decide to put his camera on a</text>
  <text start="778.38" dur="5.78">tripod tripod and take photos of himself</text>
  <text start="781.91" dur="6.67">because all of the photos look</text>
  <text start="784.16" dur="9.73">absolutely staged and if this website</text>
  <text start="788.58" dur="9.3">did exist and it is his website why did</text>
  <text start="793.89" dur="5.64">he registered privately that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="797.88" dur="5.07">make sense for someone who&amp;#39;s going to do</text>
  <text start="799.53" dur="6.78">a public killing so something doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="802.95" dur="6.96">make sense here and if you believe the</text>
  <text start="806.31" dur="7.14">story right now of all of this where was</text>
  <text start="809.91" dur="5.25">the NSA I mean they&amp;#39;re looking for</text>
  <text start="813.45" dur="5.46">terrorists aren&amp;#39;t they this site was</text>
  <text start="815.16" dur="6.6">wide open no encryption the manifesto</text>
  <text start="818.91" dur="5.91">was a text document they didn&amp;#39;t pick any</text>
  <text start="821.76" dur="4.35">of this up well of course they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="824.82" dur="3.75">this is not what they&amp;#39;re really looking</text>
  <text start="826.11" dur="4.32">for I mean of course if this is what you</text>
  <text start="828.57" dur="3.17">if you truly believe this is what the</text>
  <text start="830.43" dur="3.05">NSA is looking for</text>
  <text start="831.74" dur="5.97">we know this is not what they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="833.48" dur="8.01">for and again this website just appeared</text>
  <text start="837.71" dur="6.36">and there&amp;#39;s only two pages the front the</text>
  <text start="841.49" dur="7.17">home page and the text document there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="844.07" dur="7.68">nothing else to it so all of this really</text>
  <text start="848.66" dur="8.45">does not make sense i mean if you really</text>
  <text start="851.75" dur="9.48">think about this this was a kid who&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="857.11" dur="5.86">drugs prescription drugs to help him and</text>
  <text start="861.23" dur="4.86">there&amp;#39;s a many many side effects with</text>
  <text start="862.97" dur="7.83">this he was arrested the FBI stepped in</text>
  <text start="866.09" dur="10.68">very quickly knew who he was came out</text>
  <text start="870.8" dur="10.31">with his name picked him up and now all</text>
  <text start="876.77" dur="7.08">of a sudden it&amp;#39;s a domestic terrorism</text>
  <text start="881.11" dur="6.45">investigation and they found his</text>
  <text start="883.85" dur="5.76">manifesto how perfectly on this website</text>
  <text start="887.56" dur="5.32">now a lot of the news is out there</text>
  <text start="889.61" dur="5.82">saying they did his website it&amp;#39;s his but</text>
  <text start="892.88" dur="5.88">again all of it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense his</text>
  <text start="895.43" dur="6.92">facebook account was created recently he</text>
  <text start="898.76" dur="3.59">has like two posts on it most of the</text>
  <text start="902.62" dur="5.92">friends on Facebook are african-american</text>
  <text start="906.31" dur="4.99">so all of this when you put this</text>
  <text start="908.54" dur="6.18">together is starting to fall apart it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="911.3" dur="7.74">not making sense once again it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="914.72" dur="8.31">fit there are too many gaps it&amp;#39;s to set</text>
  <text start="919.04" dur="6.33">up it&amp;#39;s too perfect and when we look</text>
  <text start="923.03" dur="4.35">closely at all this we can see this is</text>
  <text start="925.37" dur="5.54">most likely another stage false flag</text>
  <text start="927.38" dur="6.24">event to push multiple agendas won a</text>
  <text start="930.91" dur="6.91">race war maybe there&amp;#39;s a clear martial</text>
  <text start="933.62" dur="5.76">law to the gun agenda to pass new laws</text>
  <text start="937.82" dur="4.77">because as soon as this happened we know</text>
  <text start="939.38" dur="5.37">the president was out there pushing gun</text>
  <text start="942.59" dur="4.47">legislation we know gun legislation is</text>
  <text start="944.75" dur="5.37">floating around in Congress more than</text>
  <text start="947.06" dur="5.25">one bill and it always seems that these</text>
  <text start="950.12" dur="4.77">type of shootings happen in an area</text>
  <text start="952.31" dur="5.61">where they know there&amp;#39;s going to be no</text>
