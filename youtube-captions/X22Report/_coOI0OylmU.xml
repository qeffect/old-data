  <text start="88.4" dur="5.97">economy is already in a collapse mode</text>
  <text start="91.25" dur="5.55">and the central bankers are trying to</text>
  <text start="94.37" dur="4.56">keep this hidden from everyone by</text>
  <text start="96.8" dur="6.14">keeping the market pushed up and if</text>
  <text start="98.93" dur="6.72">we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;d notice that as time goes on</text>
  <text start="102.94" dur="4.24">it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder to do</text>
  <text start="105.65" dur="4.26">this and we&amp;#39;re hearing from a lot of</text>
  <text start="107.18" dur="6.44">people right now Jim Sinclair bill</text>
  <text start="109.91" dur="9.83">halter peter schiff and many others even</text>

  <text start="125.03" dur="4.979">be able to continue and we&amp;#39;re even</text>
  <text start="127.82" dur="4.86">having a quant from JPMorgan Chase</text>
  <text start="130.009" dur="4.741">saying listen this is not over far from</text>
  <text start="132.68" dur="3.48">it the market is going to continually</text>
  <text start="134.75" dur="3.51">drop and we know what happens in</text>
  <text start="136.16" dur="6.75">people&amp;#39;s minds when this market</text>
  <text start="138.26" dur="6.449">collapses they say oh my god the economy</text>
  <text start="142.91" dur="4.499">just collapsed but we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="144.709" dur="6.541">this and the economy has been collapsing</text>
  <text start="147.409" dur="6.3">and my whole theme for what is going on</text>
  <text start="151.25" dur="6.03">here is to be prepared now it&amp;#39;s not to</text>
  <text start="153.709" dur="5.641">scare people it&amp;#39;s not to say oh you have</text>
  <text start="157.28" dur="4.41">to be scared or shivering in a corner</text>
  <text start="159.35" dur="4.62">saying oh you know I don&amp;#39;t want to do</text>
  <text start="161.69" dur="2.56">anything the purpose of it is to say you</text>
  <text start="163.97" dur="3.52">know</text>
  <text start="164.25" dur="6.36">something let&amp;#39;s get some food let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="167.49" dur="5.31">some water let&amp;#39;s get some supplies now</text>
  <text start="170.61" dur="4.68">for those people who hunt who have fresh</text>
  <text start="172.8" dur="4.05">water most likely you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="175.29" dur="4.11">worry about this but there&amp;#39;s many people</text>
  <text start="176.85" dur="5.58">out there who don&amp;#39;t have access to this</text>
  <text start="179.4" dur="5.13">and the reason why I&amp;#39;m saying this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="182.43" dur="3.6">not because all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="184.53" dur="3.47">manufacturers won&amp;#39;t be able to produce</text>
  <text start="186.03" dur="3.99">foo but we&amp;#39;re gonna run out of you know</text>
  <text start="188" dur="4.54">chickens we&amp;#39;re going to run out no</text>
  <text start="190.02" dur="6.689">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is the deliveries</text>
  <text start="192.54" dur="6.87">to the stores that&amp;#39;s where the problem</text>
  <text start="196.709" dur="6.091">is going to be as bill holder said the</text>
  <text start="199.41" dur="8.43">credit lines are going to dry up which</text>
  <text start="202.8" dur="8.13">will make it difficult to transport the</text>
  <text start="207.84" dur="5.13">merchandise to the stores and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="210.93" dur="4.11">where the breakdown occurs i mean we see</text>
  <text start="212.97" dur="5.85">it enjoy in Argentina we see it in</text>
  <text start="215.04" dur="7.169">Venezuela we see it in Greece and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="218.82" dur="6.45">going to see it here I mean already the</text>
  <text start="222.209" dur="5.431">governor of China&amp;#39;s central bank said</text>
  <text start="225.27" dur="5.88">multiple times this week to his g20</text>
  <text start="227.64" dur="9">colleagues that a bubble in his country</text>
  <text start="231.15" dur="8.61">had burst what they&amp;#39;re saying is things</text>
  <text start="236.64" dur="5.01">are starting to fall apart and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="239.76" dur="4.67">coming down rapidly and we know the</text>
  <text start="241.65" dur="5.01">central bankers realize this they know</text>
  <text start="244.43" dur="5.29">they&amp;#39;re doing whatever they possibly can</text>
  <text start="246.66" dur="6.18">to keep this propped up and we</text>
  <text start="249.72" dur="5.67">understand just by John Kerry&amp;#39;s words</text>
  <text start="252.84" dur="4.829">where he said listen if we don&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="255.39" dur="4.77">this deal with Iran the dollar is going</text>
  <text start="257.669" dur="4.5">to collapse that&amp;#39;s because what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="260.16" dur="5.19">planning to do is they&amp;#39;re planning to</text>
  <text start="262.169" dur="5.521">take the dollar and use it on their</text>
  <text start="265.35" dur="4.65">natural resources which is oil to prop</text>
  <text start="267.69" dur="4.59">the system up and we know they need to</text>
  <text start="270" dur="5.16">get into Syria to create that pipeline</text>
  <text start="272.28" dur="5.34">going through Syria up into Europe to</text>
  <text start="275.16" dur="3.93">capture the natural resources and to</text>
  <text start="277.62" dur="3.6">implement the central bank because you</text>
  <text start="279.09" dur="4.95">have to remember their plan was to</text>
  <text start="281.22" dur="4.65">capture the Middle East Middle East is</text>
  <text start="284.04" dur="4.56">falling apart right now they understand</text>
  <text start="285.87" dur="6.38">this and we see at this point in time</text>
  <text start="288.6" dur="6.84">Putin understands what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="292.25" dur="5.5">they already understand that this system</text>
  <text start="295.44" dur="3.93">is coming down</text>
  <text start="297.75" dur="3.15">and this is why China has been</text>
  <text start="299.37" dur="3.24">purchasing gold this is why Russia has</text>
  <text start="300.9" dur="6.42">been purchasing goal because we know in</text>
  <text start="302.61" dur="9.84">the end the person the country with the</text>
  <text start="307.32" dur="8.85">gold will survive will be able to call</text>
  <text start="312.45" dur="6.84">the shots at that point and throughout</text>
  <text start="316.17" dur="5.42">history we&amp;#39;ve seen this and already we</text>
  <text start="319.29" dur="6.42">have the Secretary of State John Kerry</text>
  <text start="321.59" dur="6.72">he&amp;#39;s expressing concerns over reports of</text>
  <text start="325.71" dur="6.81">Russia&amp;#39;s enhance military buildup now</text>
  <text start="328.31" dur="5.74">Putin has seen that the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="332.52" dur="5.18">which is the proxy army for the United</text>
  <text start="334.05" dur="6.27">States is getting closer and closer to</text>
  <text start="337.7" dur="5.07">Damascus parts of it there already then</text>
  <text start="340.32" dur="6.24">there they&amp;#39;re blocking off the water and</text>
  <text start="342.77" dur="6.37">remember Assad and Putin our allies</text>
  <text start="346.56" dur="6.48">they&amp;#39;ve made economic agreements with</text>
  <text start="349.14" dur="8.52">each other so yes Russia is bringing in</text>
  <text start="353.04" dur="7.32">the hardware they&amp;#39;re telling the United</text>
  <text start="357.66" dur="9.35">States and the central bankers we are</text>
  <text start="360.36" dur="6.65">here and if you go after Assad right now</text>
  <text start="368" dur="8.11">this will be a problem and this is why</text>
  <text start="373.229" dur="6.69">he&amp;#39;s calling their bluff this is why</text>
  <text start="376.11" dur="6.42">he&amp;#39;s saying he wants an international</text>
  <text start="379.919" dur="4.981">community to fight the Islamic state we</text>
  <text start="382.53" dur="5.82">should all join together now the United</text>
  <text start="384.9" dur="4.95">States they can&amp;#39;t say no we don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="388.35" dur="5.21">you to do this we&amp;#39;ll take care of it</text>
  <text start="389.85" dur="8.72">remember they&amp;#39;re in Syria right now</text>
  <text start="393.56" dur="8.71">illegally it&amp;#39;s against international law</text>
  <text start="398.57" dur="6.46">Putin is in there legally from the week</text>
  <text start="402.27" dur="7.47">from the request from Assad big</text>
  <text start="405.03" dur="7.92">difference here and he is basically</text>
  <text start="409.74" dur="6.96">setting up saying this is going to be</text>
  <text start="412.95" dur="6.469">war if you make your move now we know</text>
  <text start="416.7" dur="5.16">the US government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="419.419" dur="6.881">going to make the move unless Putin</text>
  <text start="421.86" dur="8.19">somehow someway calms the situation down</text>
  <text start="426.3" dur="5.25">and he&amp;#39;s not taking any chances and this</text>
  <text start="430.05" dur="7.83">is why he&amp;#39;s bringing in the military</text>
  <text start="431.55" dur="7.92">assets and at this point the u.s. is out</text>
  <text start="437.88" dur="5.34">there saying if Russia goes in there it</text>
  <text start="439.47" dur="5.16">will destabilize the entire area I mean</text>
  <text start="443.22" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;re trying to use any excuse</text>
  <text start="444.63" dur="8.25">possible so what does this all mean what</text>
  <text start="449.88" dur="8.37">it means is we&amp;#39;re on the cusp of World</text>
  <text start="452.88" dur="13.17">War three we&amp;#39;re heading down that path</text>
  <text start="458.25" dur="10.05">and we can see that putin russia on one</text>
  <text start="466.05" dur="5.87">side and we have the united states and</text>
  <text start="468.3" dur="6.78">the coalition forces on the other side</text>
  <text start="471.92" dur="8.76">the problem is how is this going to play</text>
  <text start="475.08" dur="8.79">out because one wrong move that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="480.68" dur="6.67">that would be the big bang that would be</text>
  <text start="483.87" dur="5.34">World War 3 and that means Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="487.35" dur="3.98">getting involved now we know if Russia</text>
  <text start="489.21" dur="4.68">gets involved what is going to happen</text>
  <text start="491.33" dur="6.67">China&amp;#39;s going to get involved we already</text>
  <text start="493.89" dur="7.53">know from the Pentagon from their report</text>
  <text start="498" dur="8.94">who the players are who will be fighting</text>
  <text start="501.42" dur="8.85">it is China Russia Iran Syria North</text>
  <text start="506.94" dur="6.63">Korea and Alyssa some other countries</text>
  <text start="510.27" dur="5.34">which will join in later but we can see</text>
  <text start="513.57" dur="6.06">at this point the United States has been</text>
  <text start="515.61" dur="5.76">provoking provoking provoking trying to</text>
  <text start="519.63" dur="3.09">get something started now from</text>
  <text start="521.37" dur="3.27">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been hearing and</text>
  <text start="522.72" dur="5.52">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been seeing at</text>
  <text start="524.64" dur="8.79">this point in time we are heading down a</text>
  <text start="528.24" dur="9.78">path that is going to be volatile not</text>
  <text start="533.43" dur="6.99">just economically we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="538.02" dur="7.35">what is happening in the Middle East I</text>
  <text start="540.42" dur="7.68">mean we have this refugee crisis we have</text>
  <text start="545.37" dur="5.55">the UN coming in saying we have to do</text>
  <text start="548.1" dur="5.31">something with them we have to separate</text>
  <text start="550.92" dur="4.13">them into the different EU countries the</text>
  <text start="553.41" dur="3.75">countries are saying we don&amp;#39;t want them</text>
  <text start="555.05" dur="4.63">we&amp;#39;re hearing that this is the worst</text>
  <text start="557.16" dur="7.59">refugee refugee crisis since world war</text>
  <text start="559.68" dur="5.76">two and this is all driven by the United</text>
  <text start="564.75" dur="2.45">States government</text>
  <text start="565.44" dur="5.55">central bankers and the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="567.2" dur="6.31">when they created al-qaeda the Islamic</text>
  <text start="570.99" dur="6.51">state and they created all this war</text>
  <text start="573.51" dur="5.91">throughout the Middle East and from all</text>
  <text start="577.5" dur="5.58">of this this is all being done right now</text>
  <text start="579.42" dur="7.38">to cover up what is coming this is not a</text>
  <text start="583.08" dur="6.15">time to wait for the last minute to do</text>
  <text start="586.8" dur="4.68">something where you sit there and say</text>
  <text start="589.23" dur="3.51">you know I really don&amp;#39;t believe him so</text>

  <text start="592.74" dur="6.48">last minute let me see if it actually</text>
  <text start="594.93" dur="8.46">happens I hate to say it but at that</text>
  <text start="599.22" dur="7.17">point it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s too late you will be</text>
  <text start="603.39" dur="6.99">stuck it&amp;#39;s almost like when we had</text>
  <text start="606.39" dur="5.6">hurricane sandy come in and I have</text>
  <text start="610.38" dur="5.64">family members who live in that area</text>

  <text start="622.14" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t believe that it&amp;#39;s gonna hit as bad</text>
  <text start="623.97" dur="5.22">as they&amp;#39;re saying i know a lot of us do</text>
  <text start="626.79" dur="4.62">this a lot of us say that it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="629.19" dur="4.5">to be as bad as they&amp;#39;re telling us and</text>
  <text start="631.41" dur="4.23">we just can&amp;#39;t believe it you can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="633.69" dur="5.7">it through your head that yeah I better</text>

  <text start="658.41" dur="6.66">have been ready and I don&amp;#39;t want anyone</text>
  <text start="661.68" dur="6.36">to say that oh I should have done this I</text>
  <text start="665.07" dur="5.79">should have done that because what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="668.04" dur="5.48">worst-case scenario let&amp;#39;s say we go</text>
  <text start="670.86" dur="5.61">through this fall this winter and</text>
  <text start="673.52" dur="4.06">absolutely nothing happens do I think</text>

  <text start="712.17" dur="6.72">many people that you really can&amp;#39;t say oh</text>
  <text start="716.25" dur="6.39">this might not happen it won&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="718.89" dur="7.41">because there are so many of us who are</text>
