  <text start="58.44" dur="5.999">this is episode 1392 a and today&amp;#39;s date</text>
  <text start="61.499" dur="5.461">is October 3rd 2017 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="64.439" dur="4.561">the episode is Russia and China continue</text>
  <text start="66.96" dur="4.89">to hoard gold to prepare for the dollar</text>
  <text start="69" dur="6.02">collapse let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="71.85" dur="6.589">collapse financial news now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="75.02" dur="6.61">following the global economy and we</text>
  <text start="78.439" dur="5.381">realize that most of the numbers that</text>
  <text start="81.63" dur="3.629">these government&amp;#39;s put out they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="83.82" dur="4.35">completely fake phony and false and</text>
  <text start="85.259" dur="6.181">we&amp;#39;ve shown how they manipulate these</text>
  <text start="88.17" dur="6.57">numbers very very easily now out in the</text>
  <text start="91.44" dur="8.25">EU we can see that the unemployment rate</text>
  <text start="94.74" dur="8.07">really hasn&amp;#39;t changed since 2009 youth</text>
  <text start="99.69" dur="6.45">unemployment is very very high in many</text>
  <text start="102.81" dur="6.3">EU countries despites despite everything</text>
  <text start="106.14" dur="5.039">they try to do to fix the problem now</text>
  <text start="109.11" dur="4.02">the problem is is that there&amp;#39;s no jobs</text>
  <text start="111.179" dur="4.8">the problem is these countries are going</text>
  <text start="113.13" dur="5.489">into debt the problem is the central</text>
  <text start="115.979" dur="4.65">banks are ordering austerity and when</text>
  <text start="118.619" dur="6.541">you put all this together you get a</text>
  <text start="120.629" dur="9.571">situation which guess what it cannot be</text>
  <text start="125.16" dur="6.96">a robust type of an economy they destroy</text>
  <text start="130.2" dur="4.8">economies they don&amp;#39;t make them better</text>
  <text start="132.12" dur="4.47">and this is exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="135" dur="3.06">now here in the United States what</text>
  <text start="136.59" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;ve done is they&amp;#39;ve completely</text>
  <text start="138.06" dur="5.759">manipulated the statistical numbers they</text>
  <text start="142.14" dur="3.72">make everyone believe that the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.819" dur="4.381">doing well they make everyone believe</text>
  <text start="145.86" dur="3.9">that you know kids are going to college</text>
  <text start="148.2" dur="3.36">and they&amp;#39;re getting a good education</text>
  <text start="149.76" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re coming out and they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="151.56" dur="3.45">jobs which we know this is fake phony</text>
  <text start="153.09" dur="4.649">and false because we know the number of</text>
  <text start="155.01" dur="4.559">college students and the youth who are</text>
  <text start="157.739" dur="3.451">graduating high school they are living</text>
  <text start="159.569" dur="3.361">with their parents longer and longer and</text>
  <text start="161.19" dur="3.96">longer and we know that they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="162.93" dur="3.389">modifying the student loans because most</text>
  <text start="165.15" dur="3.57">of these people can&amp;#39;t pay back their</text>
  <text start="166.319" dur="3.661">student loans and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="168.72" dur="5.73">interesting about the student loan</text>
  <text start="169.98" dur="7.56">market is that basically the government</text>
  <text start="174.45" dur="5.899">well they can&amp;#39;t bail out the student</text>
  <text start="177.54" dur="7.02">loan market so they figured out a way of</text>
  <text start="180.349" dur="7.271">how to bail out the student loan market</text>
  <text start="184.56" dur="6.03">and make individuals</text>
  <text start="187.62" dur="4.229">homes now remember they need to push and</text>
  <text start="190.59" dur="4.38">I&amp;#39;m talking about the central bank they</text>
  <text start="191.849" dur="5.581">need the people of the United States to</text>
  <text start="194.97" dur="6.29">take out more and more debt they also</text>
  <text start="197.43" dur="7.169">need the ability to get rid of those</text>
  <text start="201.26" dur="5.619">individuals that are defaulting and they</text>
  <text start="204.599" dur="5.271">need a bailout for that so how did they</text>
  <text start="206.879" dur="5.791">do this well home builder at Lenoir</text>
  <text start="209.87" dur="5.41">they&amp;#39;ve come up with a genius strategy</text>
  <text start="212.67" dur="5.179">to partially eliminate the massive</text>
  <text start="215.28" dur="5.4">bubble in the student loan market</text>
  <text start="217.849" dur="4.931">because a lot of graduates guess what</text>
  <text start="220.68" dur="4.199">they can&amp;#39;t find high paying jobs they</text>
  <text start="222.78" dur="4.56">might have one or two part-time jobs or</text>
  <text start="224.879" dur="5.461">one low-paying job and their student</text>
  <text start="227.34" dur="4.86">loans are you know quite a bit and they</text>
  <text start="230.34" dur="4.41">are having a very difficult time making</text>
  <text start="232.2" dur="4.77">their loan payments even though the the</text>
  <text start="234.75" dur="5.579">government came in and they modified</text>
  <text start="236.97" dur="4.95">their loan amount and they projected it</text>
  <text start="240.329" dur="3.391">out over the number of years where they</text>
  <text start="241.92" dur="4.2">can have this payout people are still</text>
  <text start="243.72" dur="5.489">having a very rough time in doing this</text>
  <text start="246.12" dur="5.429">so Lenoir developed an innovative</text>
  <text start="249.209" dur="4.291">mortgage design to allow Millennials the</text>
  <text start="251.549" dur="6.271">opportunity to convert their student</text>
  <text start="253.5" dur="7.289">loan debt into investment in America how</text>
  <text start="257.82" dur="4.86">are they going to do this well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="260.789" dur="5.13">gonna purchase a home they&amp;#39;re gonna take</text>
  <text start="262.68" dur="6.419">out a mortgage and Lennar guess what I</text>
  <text start="265.919" dur="6.091">guess they&amp;#39;re going to integrate that</text>
  <text start="269.099" dur="4.44">student loan into the mortgage they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="272.01" dur="5.04">have a house they&amp;#39;ll have the mortgage</text>
  <text start="273.539" dur="5.1">and they&amp;#39;ll be able to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="277.05" dur="4.77">student loan debt and purchase a home</text>
  <text start="278.639" dur="5.911">and basically extend the debt even</text>
  <text start="281.82" dur="4.469">further now Lenora is set to introduce</text>
  <text start="284.55" dur="3.78">the new promotion that will make</text>
  <text start="286.289" dur="5.521">payments on buyer student loans equal to</text>
  <text start="288.33" dur="5.91">3% of their purchase price up to 13,000</text>
  <text start="291.81" dur="4.5">and return for purchasing a new Lenoir</text>
  <text start="294.24" dur="4.859">home and it&amp;#39;s simple as that</text>
  <text start="296.31" dur="6">so Lenoir will make payments to a buyer</text>
  <text start="299.099" dur="8.761">student loan of as much as 3% of the</text>
  <text start="302.31" dur="7.85">purchase price up to 13,000 now who is</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="4.589">guaranteeing this well Fannie Mae a</text>
  <text start="310.16" dur="4.42">government-sponsored enterprise has</text>
  <text start="312.449" dur="5.34">agreed to back the new innovative loans</text>
  <text start="314.58" dur="6.12">from Lenoir now we could see at this</text>
  <text start="317.789" dur="5.251">point that these</text>
  <text start="320.7" dur="4.44">fools who are having a very tough time</text>
  <text start="323.04" dur="5.34">paying their student loans or will</text>
  <text start="325.14" dur="6.03">purchase the house this is a desperate</text>
  <text start="328.38" dur="6">attempt to get people to purchase homes</text>
  <text start="331.17" dur="4.68">because if the housing market and the</text>
  <text start="334.38" dur="3.69">job market was so great</text>
  <text start="335.85" dur="3.48">we wouldn&amp;#39;t they wouldn&amp;#39;t be doing all</text>
  <text start="338.07" dur="3.63">of this they wouldn&amp;#39;t go to the sub</text>
  <text start="339.33" dur="6.06">subprime level they wouldn&amp;#39;t be making</text>
  <text start="341.7" dur="6.72">these programs up and we can see that</text>
  <text start="345.39" dur="4.59">this is gonna go all wrong once the</text>
  <text start="348.42" dur="3.12">entire system starts to break apart</text>
  <text start="349.98" dur="3.24">which it is breaking apart right now</text>
  <text start="351.54" dur="4.17">and this is this is how desperate</text>
  <text start="353.22" dur="6.26">they&amp;#39;re getting so we can see right now</text>
  <text start="355.71" dur="6.69">this is exactly what they are doing and</text>
  <text start="359.48" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re going to try to help the</text>
  <text start="362.4" dur="6.81">situation in the student loan market</text>
  <text start="364.67" dur="7.9">while pushing the sales of homes while</text>
  <text start="369.21" dur="5.79">pushing the debt level even larger</text>
  <text start="372.57" dur="4.32">because think about it these individuals</text>
  <text start="375" dur="3.42">if they have student loans of thirty</text>
  <text start="376.89" dur="3.21">thousand they&amp;#39;re gonna pay up thirteen</text>
  <text start="378.42" dur="3.84">thousand plus they&amp;#39;re taking out a</text>
  <text start="380.1" dur="5.22">mortgage so their payment is even larger</text>
  <text start="382.26" dur="6.51">than it was once before now it sounds</text>
  <text start="385.32" dur="5.4">good but we can see right now that this</text>
  <text start="388.77" dur="4.68">whole thing is going to come to a</text>
  <text start="390.72" dur="5.43">screeching halt when everything starts</text>
  <text start="393.45" dur="4.5">to completely fall apart and all these</text>
  <text start="396.15" dur="4.95">individuals that get in on this program</text>
  <text start="397.95" dur="4.35">just like back in 2007-2008 when all</text>
  <text start="401.1" dur="2.91">these people started to buy all these</text>
  <text start="402.3" dur="3.78">different homes that you know 0%</text>
  <text start="404.01" dur="4.26">interest and they&amp;#39;re buying house after</text>
  <text start="406.08" dur="3.96">house this seems like we&amp;#39;re heading down</text>
  <text start="408.27" dur="4.02">the same path and it&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="410.04" dur="4.44">complete and utter disaster now we</text>
  <text start="412.29" dur="5.97">understand that Russia and China they</text>
  <text start="414.48" dur="6.75">are insuring their wealth by continually</text>
  <text start="418.26" dur="5.73">buying gold actually trading the US</text>
  <text start="421.23" dur="5.19">dollar in for gold and the Central Bank</text>
  <text start="423.99" dur="4.35">of Russia has more than doubled the pace</text>
  <text start="426.42" dur="4.83">of gold purchases over the past decade</text>
  <text start="428.34" dur="4.71">adding more than twelve hundred tons to</text>
  <text start="431.25" dur="4.35">its gold reserves and this is according</text>
  <text start="433.05" dur="4.77">to the World Gold Council data now in</text>
  <text start="435.6" dur="4.74">the second quarter alone it accounted</text>
  <text start="437.82" dur="4.59">for 38% of all gold purchases by the</text>
  <text start="440.34" dur="4.38">central banks and we can also see that</text>
  <text start="442.41" dur="3.75">China is doing the same thing where</text>
  <text start="444.72" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re continually hoarding gold</text>
  <text start="446.16" dur="4.05">because right now it&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="448.11" dur="5.91">inexpensive and they understand that</text>
  <text start="450.21" dur="6.66">this is going to ensure the country</text>
  <text start="454.02" dur="4.98">and we see right now that both countries</text>
  <text start="456.87" dur="4.41">and many other countries are doing the</text>
  <text start="459" dur="5.04">same exact thing because they understand</text>
  <text start="461.28" dur="5.61">that the dollar is not going to survive</text>
  <text start="464.04" dur="4.32">that much longer and everyone should be</text>
  <text start="466.89" dur="3.15">looking at this saying and scratching</text>
  <text start="468.36" dur="3.63">their head saying well if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="470.04" dur="4.86">purchasing or trading in the dollar for</text>
  <text start="471.99" dur="4.92">all this gold maybe we should do the</text>
  <text start="474.9" dur="3.84">same maybe we should buy some type of</text>
  <text start="476.91" dur="4.98">precious metal maybe we should ensure</text>
  <text start="478.74" dur="5.25">our wealth somehow someway and do</text>
  <text start="481.89" dur="3.63">exactly what the other countries or</text>
  <text start="483.99" dur="3.51">central banks are doing and we need to</text>
  <text start="485.52" dur="4.11">understand that this just didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="487.5" dur="7.47">yesterday this has been an ongoing</text>
  <text start="489.63" dur="7.62">process since 2009 2010 where they</text>
  <text start="494.97" dur="5.16">continually added more and more gold to</text>
  <text start="497.25" dur="4.29">their vaults and they&amp;#39;ve been preparing</text>
  <text start="500.13" dur="3.51">for a very long time now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="501.54" dur="4.35">following this for quite a while and we</text>
  <text start="503.64" dur="3.99">realized that Russia created a payment</text>
  <text start="505.89" dur="4.11">system China&amp;#39;s created a payment system</text>
  <text start="507.63" dur="4.71">they understand that they bypass the</text>
  <text start="510" dur="6.48">dollar they started a trade amongst</text>
  <text start="512.34" dur="7.35">their own currency China introduced the</text>
  <text start="516.48" dur="6.6">Shanghai gold exchange they duplicated</text>
  <text start="519.69" dur="6.24">the markets out in China and we see that</text>
  <text start="523.08" dur="4.56">this was all done on purpose and this</text>
  <text start="525.93" dur="4.8">wasn&amp;#39;t done overnight</text>
  <text start="527.64" dur="5.19">this was done over a period of time</text>
  <text start="530.73" dur="3.93">because they knew it was going to take a</text>
  <text start="532.83" dur="5.49">while to do all of this and this was</text>
  <text start="534.66" dur="5.46">planned from the very beginning just</text>
  <text start="538.32" dur="5.73">like when the United States became the</text>
  <text start="540.12" dur="6.3">reserve currency back in 1947 this was</text>
  <text start="544.05" dur="4.17">planned way ahead of schedule this</text>
  <text start="546.42" dur="2.34">wasn&amp;#39;t something that they&amp;#39;d say hey you</text>
  <text start="548.22" dur="2.25">know what</text>
  <text start="548.76" dur="4.53">let the dollar become the reserve</text>
  <text start="550.47" dur="6.84">currency this was planned way ahead back</text>
  <text start="553.29" dur="5.67">in the early 30s and it took a very long</text>
  <text start="557.31" dur="3.63">time to get the planning done and</text>
  <text start="558.96" dur="3.99">everything set and of course they had</text>
  <text start="560.94" dur="4.5">this event which was called World War</text>
  <text start="562.95" dur="5.31">two where they pretty much covered up</text>
  <text start="565.44" dur="6.48">what was going on and they were they</text>
  <text start="568.26" dur="5.34">allowed the system to reset where the</text>
  <text start="571.92" dur="4.38">United States took the gold from all the</text>
  <text start="573.6" dur="4.89">countries and the central banks decided</text>
  <text start="576.3" dur="5.13">okay now we have a new reserve currency</text>
  <text start="578.49" dur="5.37">we&amp;#39;ll hold on to the gold will basically</text>
  <text start="581.43" dur="5.19">peg the dollar to the gold and</text>
  <text start="583.86" dur="3.63">eventually what we&amp;#39;ll do is we&amp;#39;ll remove</text>
  <text start="586.62" dur="3.87">the peg</text>
  <text start="587.49" dur="5.459">at a later date and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="590.49" dur="5.759">they do the central banks they are very</text>
  <text start="592.949" dur="5.101">patient they understand that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="596.249" dur="4.89">need to rush and do things they make a</text>
  <text start="598.05" dur="5.19">lot of money in between and they realize</text>
  <text start="601.139" dur="4.61">that they can be very patient they can</text>
  <text start="603.24" dur="6.149">be very methodical and they can wait a</text>
  <text start="605.749" dur="7">period of time before they act and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="609.389" dur="5.461">seen this time and time again and the</text>
  <text start="612.749" dur="4.051">preparation for this new reserve</text>
  <text start="614.85" dur="3.179">currency which might be the SDR it might</text>
  <text start="616.8" dur="4.05">be a cryptocurrency it might be a</text>
  <text start="618.029" dur="5.071">combination of both we can see that this</text>
  <text start="620.85" dur="3.839">has been planned for quite a while we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="623.1" dur="3.539">been following it this is the reason why</text>
  <text start="624.689" dur="4.531">we&amp;#39;re checking and watching this every</text>
  <text start="626.639" dur="5.521">single day so we understand and we know</text>
  <text start="629.22" dur="5.429">what is going on this is why you need to</text>
  <text start="632.16" dur="5.339">be ready and prepared yes to everyone</text>
  <text start="634.649" dur="5.49">else it&amp;#39;s going to seem like this just</text>
  <text start="637.499" dur="5.041">happen we might have some type of an</text>
  <text start="640.139" dur="4.471">event and after the event you know</text>
  <text start="642.54" dur="3.69">something will change and everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="644.61" dur="3.959">gonna sit there going wow because we had</text>
  <text start="646.23" dur="3.57">this no longer can the US be the reserve</text>
  <text start="648.569" dur="3.63">currency because the financial</text>
  <text start="649.8" dur="4.319">institutions were hit by some type of an</text>
  <text start="652.199" dur="4.68">attack or something happened and this is</text>
  <text start="654.119" dur="4.41">why it&amp;#39;s moving to the IMF or moving to</text>
