  <text start="50.289" dur="9.421">collapse news we&amp;#39;re going to go back to</text>
  <text start="54.039" dur="9.241">Cyprus and Cyprus has agreed and the</text>
  <text start="59.71" dur="8.159">lenders and the government all agreed</text>
  <text start="63.28" dur="7.65">that 47.5 percent would be perfect to</text>
  <text start="67.869" dur="4.89">take from the people almost half of</text>
  <text start="70.93" dur="4.92">their money if you have a hundred</text>
  <text start="72.759" dur="5.161">thousand euros or more so just think of</text>
  <text start="75.85" dur="5">yourself in whatever country you&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="77.92" dur="7.11">if you&amp;#39;re in America or Australia Europe</text>
  <text start="80.85" dur="7.75">England and you had a bank holiday and</text>
  <text start="85.03" dur="5.22">they came out and you woke up one</text>
  <text start="88.6" dur="4.5">morning and you couldn&amp;#39;t take your money</text>
  <text start="90.25" dur="4.59">out and everything was frozen and they</text>

  <text start="94.84" dur="4.91">your money how would you feel at that</text>
  <text start="97.869" dur="5.191">point I can&amp;#39;t even imagine what the</text>
  <text start="99.75" dur="5.02">Cypriots must feel like knowing that all</text>
  <text start="103.06" dur="4.04">their money their hard-earned money that</text>
  <text start="104.77" dur="5.129">they work for is going to completely</text>
  <text start="107.1" dur="5.17">disappear and I understand that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="109.899" dur="4.921">going to get the bank stock or whatever</text>
  <text start="112.27" dur="5.82">other pieces of paper and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="114.82" dur="5.07">to you know tell them that you know your</text>
  <text start="118.09" dur="4.23">money still here but it&amp;#39;s not really</text>
  <text start="119.89" dur="4.56">here and oh and by the way we still have</text>
  <text start="122.32" dur="4.229">capital controls your bank accounts are</text>
  <text start="124.45" dur="4.82">still frozen you can&amp;#39;t take anything out</text>
  <text start="126.549" dur="6.751">it&amp;#39;s been over a hundred days now and</text>
  <text start="129.27" dur="7.03">it&amp;#39;s just not good for the Cypriot</text>
  <text start="133.3" dur="3.81">people and again they came out and you</text>
  <text start="136.3" dur="2.22">know in the beginning</text>
  <text start="137.11" dur="3.45">they said if you remember it was going</text>
  <text start="138.52" dur="5.01">to be look like you know eight percent</text>
  <text start="140.56" dur="4.89">sixteen percent then they said 37.5</text>
  <text start="143.53" dur="3.93">percent and then they said anywhere</text>
  <text start="145.45" dur="3.72">between fifty and sixty percent so I</text>
  <text start="147.46" dur="3.57">guess when they say forty seven point</text>
  <text start="149.17" dur="4.77">five percent that makes you feel good</text>
  <text start="151.03" dur="5.64">because they didn&amp;#39;t take out fifty to</text>
  <text start="153.94" dur="6.87">sixty percent but but no matter which</text>
  <text start="156.67" dur="8.37">way you look at it it is awful and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="160.81" dur="7.23">it it&amp;#39;s a template for the balance we do</text>

  <text start="177.15" dur="6.28">legislation drawn up to include the</text>
  <text start="180.4" dur="4.74">balance again if you look in the United</text>
  <text start="183.43" dur="3.779">States a lot of terms of service of the</text>
  <text start="185.14" dur="5.099">banks you will see that they have</text>
  <text start="187.209" dur="7.021">changed their terms of service and they</text>
  <text start="190.239" dur="6.151">have stated that you know if that</text>
  <text start="194.23" dur="4.979">everyone is not a depositor they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="196.39" dur="4.8">changed them into creditors and they</text>
  <text start="199.209" dur="6.03">listed a whole bunch of dannette</text>
  <text start="201.19" dur="9.15">disaster scenarios and you&amp;#39;re not able</text>
  <text start="205.239" dur="7.081">to go after the officers representatives</text>
  <text start="210.34" dur="5.399">of the banks if you know if there were</text>
  <text start="212.32" dur="7.53">riots war computer malfunctions cyber</text>
  <text start="215.739" dur="6.421">attacks blackout EMP they just have a</text>
  <text start="219.85" dur="6.389">whole list of things that go on with</text>
  <text start="222.16" dur="9.66">this okay let&amp;#39;s move on here now back to</text>
  <text start="226.239" dur="8.641">housing and we we know that housing is</text>
  <text start="231.82" dur="6.51">not doing as well as the mainstream</text>
  <text start="234.88" dur="5.63">media wants us all to think what is</text>
  <text start="238.33" dur="4.59">happening with housing well since the</text>
  <text start="240.51" dur="4.47">interest rates are rising it makes it</text>
  <text start="242.92" dur="4.44">much more difficult for people to</text>
  <text start="244.98" dur="4.39">qualify to purchase homes so what</text>
  <text start="247.36" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;ve done is they&amp;#39;re trying to make</text>
  <text start="249.37" dur="4.02">it a no down payment or you know five</text>
  <text start="251.98" dur="3.72">hundred or a thousand dollar down</text>
  <text start="253.39" dur="6.99">payment type of mortgage and a lot of</text>
  <text start="255.7" dur="7.44">people are moving into arms adjustable</text>
  <text start="260.38" dur="5.88">rate mortgages to afford these homes and</text>
  <text start="263.14" dur="6.6">people who are already have their homes</text>
  <text start="266.26" dur="6.08">or switching to arms so they can lower</text>
  <text start="269.74" dur="6.12">their pain</text>
  <text start="272.34" dur="6.58">to make it easier for them to live but</text>
  <text start="275.86" dur="6.75">what&amp;#39;s happening is those people who had</text>
  <text start="278.92" dur="5.94">existing arms at already low interest</text>
  <text start="282.61" dur="3.78">rates have seen them you know creep up a</text>
  <text start="284.86" dur="6.33">little bit and their payments are</text>
  <text start="286.39" dur="9.15">getting higher and we&amp;#39;re seeing this all</text>
  <text start="291.19" dur="6.54">over the place and a sure sign that that</text>
  <text start="295.54" dur="6.5">housing is not doing well is that the</text>
  <text start="297.73" dur="9.09">mortgage applications have plunged and</text>
  <text start="302.04" dur="7.63">that will eventually move into the sales</text>
  <text start="306.82" dur="7.5">of the homes already home builders like</text>
  <text start="309.67" dur="8.34">DR Horton are seeing traffic decline and</text>
  <text start="314.32" dur="8.25">new home sales decline and this will go</text>
  <text start="318.01" dur="7.58">forward as all of these mortgage</text>
  <text start="322.57" dur="6.39">applications that are non-existent now</text>
  <text start="325.59" dur="5.98">start to taper off and the sales start</text>
  <text start="328.96" dur="5.61">to taper off and then all of a sudden we</text>
  <text start="331.57" dur="5.7">will see that these sales of homes are</text>
  <text start="334.57" dur="5.52">just out of reach for the everyday</text>
  <text start="337.27" dur="6.96">person because you know most of them are</text>
  <text start="340.09" dur="6.03">under applied unemployed and a lot of</text>
  <text start="344.23" dur="3.69">them have foreclosed and we have to</text>
  <text start="346.12" dur="5.58">remember the Fed is still bought buying</text>
  <text start="347.92" dur="5.4">the toxic real estate from all the banks</text>
  <text start="351.7" dur="5.52">because they have tons of foreclosure</text>
  <text start="353.32" dur="9.18">still on the books and the housing</text>
  <text start="357.22" dur="8.34">recovery is not there and we can see</text>
  <text start="362.5" dur="6.33">this by a report that came out that four</text>
  <text start="365.56" dur="6.18">and five in the u.s. fear near poverty</text>
  <text start="368.83" dur="5.94">and they have no work now how could this</text>
  <text start="371.74" dur="5.64">be possible four out of four out of five</text>
  <text start="374.77" dur="5.09">people in the US are near poverty or</text>
  <text start="377.38" dur="5.31">have no work but the housing market is</text>
  <text start="379.86" dur="6.16">supposedly booming it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="382.69" dur="5.64">whatsoever and this goes on to say four</text>
  <text start="386.02" dur="4.8">out of five US adults struggle with</text>
  <text start="388.33" dur="4.44">joblessness near poverty or reliance on</text>
  <text start="390.82" dur="4.2">welfare for at least parts of their</text>
  <text start="392.77" dur="5.37">lives a sign of deteriorating economic</text>
  <text start="395.02" dur="8.16">security and an elusive American Dream</text>
  <text start="398.14" dur="6.269">and Irene sailors went on to say I think</text>
  <text start="403.18" dur="3.689">it&amp;#39;s going to get worse</text>
  <text start="404.409" dur="5.31">if you do try to go apply for a job</text>
  <text start="406.869" dur="6.961">they&amp;#39;re not hiring people they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="409.719" dur="7.65">paying that much to even go to work and</text>
  <text start="413.83" dur="5.819">these part-time jobs that people have to</text>
  <text start="417.369" dur="5.34">take after they were laid off from their</text>
  <text start="419.649" dur="6.181">full-time job some people have one two</text>
  <text start="422.709" dur="5.73">even three part-time jobs and still</text>
  <text start="425.83" dur="5">aren&amp;#39;t making the same amount as they</text>
  <text start="428.439" dur="6.18">wore when they had their full-time jobs</text>
  <text start="430.83" dur="5.859">so for that for the government and for</text>
  <text start="434.619" dur="4.91">the Fed and for the mainstream media to</text>
  <text start="436.689" dur="7.65">say this housing market is booming it</text>
  <text start="439.529" dur="8.14">isn&amp;#39;t the stock market the bond market</text>
  <text start="444.339" dur="7.17">the student loan market the housing</text>
  <text start="447.669" dur="9.77">market are all being driven by the Fed</text>
  <text start="451.509" dur="9.24">the Fed is the market the end that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="457.439" dur="8.5">now the government realizes something</text>
  <text start="460.749" dur="8.42">the stock market and the economy are at</text>
  <text start="465.939" dur="6.45">a disconnect there disconnecting they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="469.169" dur="5.22">completely on the opposite sides now the</text>
  <text start="472.389" dur="6.71">stock market is down a little bit today</text>
  <text start="474.389" dur="7.411">gold is ended in a positive note but</text>
  <text start="479.099" dur="5.05">even though they want everyone and</text>
  <text start="481.8" dur="5.649">everyone&amp;#39;s eyes are on the stock market</text>
  <text start="484.149" dur="8.07">at all time new highs they realize that</text>
  <text start="487.449" dur="6.72">the economy the unemployment the GDP</text>
  <text start="492.219" dur="5.641">inflation all the calculations they</text>
  <text start="494.169" dur="6.93">changed still they&amp;#39;re still having a</text>
  <text start="497.86" dur="6.209">problem convincing everyone that the</text>
  <text start="501.099" dur="4.65">economy is doing well so even though</text>
  <text start="504.069" dur="4.11">they went out of their way and they</text>
  <text start="505.749" dur="6.6">changed all the calculations and all the</text>
  <text start="508.179" dur="7.621">data that&amp;#39;s coming in is fake too and</text>
  <text start="512.349" dur="5.88">manipulated so it allows them to show</text>
  <text start="515.8" dur="5.25">the mainstream media and all those other</text>
  <text start="518.229" dur="4.47">people that are still sleeping that the</text>
  <text start="521.05" dur="6.209">economy is doing well unemployment is</text>
  <text start="522.699" dur="6.901">coming down and the GDP numbers are not</text>
  <text start="527.259" dur="3.361">where they want them to be because you</text>
  <text start="529.6" dur="3.78">know when you&amp;#39;re getting into the</text>
  <text start="530.62" dur="4.649">negative area of GDP people you know</text>
  <text start="533.38" dur="4.559">start going away what did they just say</text>
  <text start="535.269" dur="3.601">so what do they have to do well they</text>
  <text start="537.939" dur="4.501">need to change it</text>
  <text start="538.87" dur="8.13">again because the economy is getting so</text>
  <text start="542.44" dur="6.81">bad that the change calculation for gdb</text>
  <text start="547" dur="7.98">is not enough so they have to manipulate</text>
  <text start="549.25" dur="7.68">the numbers further and what this goes</text>
  <text start="554.98" dur="5.16">on to say is you don&amp;#39;t like how high</text>
  <text start="556.93" dur="5.4">debt to GDP figures are well revise them</text>
  <text start="560.14" dur="4.65">unhappy at the post recovery growth</text>
  <text start="562.33" dur="5.34">rates revise them disappointed at the</text>
  <text start="564.79" dur="5.13">pace of economic improvement in the last</text>
  <text start="567.67" dur="4.109">decade or two compared to the rest of</text>
  <text start="569.92" dur="5.52">the world well revise them and what this</text>
  <text start="571.779" dur="6.661">is what they&amp;#39;re doing there the Bureau</text>
  <text start="575.44" dur="5.43">of Economic Analysis announced on</text>
  <text start="578.44" dur="5.04">Wednesday it will start counting</text>
  <text start="580.87" dur="6.03">spending on research development and</text>
  <text start="583.48" dur="5.6">copyrights as investment and reflect</text>
  <text start="586.9" dur="5.01">pension deficit for the first time</text>
  <text start="589.08" dur="7.96">combined they are expected to add three</text>
  <text start="591.91" dur="7.53">percent to the GDP and what they went on</text>
  <text start="597.04" dur="5.52">to say is we are carrying these major</text>
  <text start="599.44" dur="5.73">changes all the way back in time which</text>
  <text start="602.56" dur="5.399">for us means to 1929 so we are</text>
  <text start="605.17" dur="6.39">essentially rewriting economic history</text>
  <text start="607.959" dur="6.511">and this is what they&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="611.56" dur="5.85">they are rewriting and changing</text>
  <text start="614.47" dur="6.36">everything so people are not aware of</text>
  <text start="617.41" dur="4.74">what is going on and they did it with</text>
  <text start="620.83" dur="2.82">unemployment people think you know</text>
  <text start="622.15" dur="3.57">unemployment around seven point six</text>
  <text start="623.65" dur="3.48">percent where it&amp;#39;s really around twenty</text>
  <text start="625.72" dur="3.96">three percent because they change it</text>
  <text start="627.13" dur="5.399">back in 1994 even if you use their use</text>
  <text start="629.68" dur="5.37">six numbers with their new calculation</text>
  <text start="632.529" dur="5.641">unemployment around fourteen percent so</text>
  <text start="635.05" dur="5.729">I mean and if you look at inflation GDP</text>
  <text start="638.17" dur="6.21">all those calculations are continually</text>
  <text start="640.779" dur="6.961">changed and this is how they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="644.38" dur="9.06">to get by and hold on before the</text>
  <text start="647.74" dur="9.12">collapse hits now we know that President</text>
