  <text start="152.85" dur="3.69">today&amp;#39;s the last day of the month but</text>
  <text start="154.17" dur="5.34">they decided they already know how many</text>
  <text start="156.54" dur="5.339">jobs are going to be and they came out</text>
  <text start="159.51" dur="4.87">and said listen September added about</text>

  <text start="204.7" dur="4.29">you&amp;#39;re going and taking away these high</text>
  <text start="207.22" dur="5.97">paying jobs in manufacturing in</text>
  <text start="208.99" dur="6.69">corporate America people are not going</text>
  <text start="213.19" dur="6.99">to be able to survive with these types</text>
  <text start="215.68" dur="6.54">of jobs and we can see it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>

  <text start="244.03" dur="6.53">and it&amp;#39;s falling and we understand why</text>
  <text start="246.19" dur="8.01">because manufacturing is not happening</text>
  <text start="250.56" dur="10.06">why isn&amp;#39;t happening well those people</text>
  <text start="254.2" dur="11.36">who are being laid off from HP unicredit</text>

  <text start="300.4" dur="7.079">recessionary levels and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="302.949" dur="6.03">that it printed at 48.7 below 50 they</text>
  <text start="307.479" dur="4.53">were expecting it to be much much higher</text>
  <text start="308.979" dur="4.59">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that a lot of</text>
  <text start="312.009" dur="5.13">the regional feds right now are</text>
  <text start="313.569" dur="8.581">reporting something really bad at this</text>

  <text start="350.56" dur="3.84">say that we&amp;#39;re heading into a recession</text>
  <text start="352.229" dur="4.78">it&amp;#39;s kind of ridiculous at this point</text>

  <text start="801.28" dur="7.21">starting and as we move forward it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="806.959" dur="2.971">really going to start to get worse an</text>
  <text start="808.49" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;re going to have to see how the</text>
  <text start="809.93" dur="4.77">central bankers deal with this of course</text>
  <text start="813.26" dur="3.329">we know they&amp;#39;re going to manipulate</text>
  <text start="814.7" dur="5.04">everything we know they&amp;#39;re going to try</text>
  <text start="816.589" dur="5.761">to prop up the system but when it gets</text>
  <text start="819.74" dur="7.23">out of hand you know what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="822.35" dur="8.04">to do you know they have something</text>
  <text start="826.97" dur="5.49">planned you know</text>
  <text start="830.39" dur="5.04">they don&amp;#39;t want to be blamed for this</text>
  <text start="832.46" dur="5.94">collapse of the entire system because in</text>
  <text start="835.43" dur="7.65">their minds they really truly believe</text>
  <text start="838.4" dur="7.14">that once the system comes down and they</text>
  <text start="843.08" dur="4.56">blame it on another country a group they</text>
  <text start="845.54" dur="5.31">want to restart it just like they did in</text>
  <text start="847.64" dur="5.25">World War two with Bretton Woods and we</text>
  <text start="850.85" dur="6.83">know right now that china is in</text>
  <text start="852.89" dur="7.65">discussions of maybe becoming the</text>

  <text start="863.18" dur="5.67">the basket of sdrs I don&amp;#39;t think they</text>
  <text start="865.01" dur="6.66">care at this point remember they have</text>
  <text start="868.85" dur="7.35">the gold they have the manufacturing the</text>
  <text start="871.67" dur="8.19">US has lost its manufacturing about 1.5</text>
  <text start="876.2" dur="7.65">million jobs which was replaced with 1.4</text>
  <text start="879.86" dur="6.84">million part-time jobs this year we</text>
  <text start="883.85" dur="5.57">haven&amp;#39;t added any manufacturing jobs and</text>
  <text start="886.7" dur="7.5">we just lost another fifteen thousand</text>
  <text start="889.42" dur="7.42">out in the ECB we see that they might</text>
  <text start="894.2" dur="10.5">have to boost QE by a hundred and twenty</text>
  <text start="896.84" dur="10.01">percent to 2.4 trillion euros because</text>
  <text start="904.7" dur="5.94">what they&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="906.85" dur="8.23">unexpected deflation and they believe</text>
  <text start="910.64" dur="8.31">they need more stimulus you know to</text>
  <text start="915.08" dur="8.04">boost inflation so they&amp;#39;re gonna pump</text>
  <text start="918.95" dur="5.57">out and create more currency of course</text>
  <text start="923.12" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s not going to the everyday person</text>
  <text start="924.52" dur="8.32">all of this is going to be going to the</text>
  <text start="926.84" dur="9.38">banks to the wealthy to the elite now</text>
  <text start="932.84" dur="7.05">China is continually buying gold and</text>
  <text start="936.22" dur="7.18">they sold their US Treasuries and they</text>
  <text start="939.89" dur="6.05">took the cash from the US Treasuries and</text>
  <text start="943.4" dur="5.34">they went and they bought more gold and</text>
  <text start="945.94" dur="4.75">China right now is the fifth in world</text>
  <text start="948.74" dur="3.39">gold holdings of course we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="950.69" dur="3.6">the total amount they might be third</text>
  <text start="952.13" dur="6.06">they might be second they could be first</text>
  <text start="954.29" dur="7.28">we don&amp;#39;t know exactly but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="958.19" dur="6.03">interesting about this is that the pboc</text>
  <text start="961.57" dur="6.37">they might start</text>
  <text start="964.22" dur="7.38">leaking incremental gold holdings every</text>
  <text start="967.94" dur="6.24">month and you say to yourself why would</text>
  <text start="971.6" dur="6.87">they do this at this point what would be</text>
  <text start="974.18" dur="7.41">the point of it well we&amp;#39;ve always said</text>
  <text start="978.47" dur="5.85">this the country that has the gold is</text>
  <text start="981.59" dur="5.25">going to be the winner when they hear a</text>
  <text start="984.32" dur="6.72">country has gold they feel it&amp;#39;s secure</text>
  <text start="986.84" dur="6.51">and I think what they&amp;#39;re going to do to</text>
  <text start="991.04" dur="4.92">build confidence is they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="993.35" dur="5.16">leak how much gold they have each month</text>
  <text start="995.96" dur="10.05">and they&amp;#39;re going to try to build</text>
  <text start="998.51" dur="10.77">confidence using this so they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1006.01" dur="7.5">to try to save what to save their</text>
  <text start="1009.28" dur="7.71">economy and to boost it up by leaking</text>
  <text start="1013.51" dur="5.94">this information now become the u.s. do</text>
  <text start="1016.99" dur="5.25">this well I don&amp;#39;t think so because the</text>
  <text start="1019.45" dur="6.78">u.s. really doesn&amp;#39;t have gold they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1022.24" dur="6.39">allow an audit of the Fed of Fort Knox</text>
  <text start="1026.23" dur="5.73">and there&amp;#39;s a lot of people out there</text>
  <text start="1028.63" dur="6.87">saying the u.s. absolutely has no gold</text>
  <text start="1031.96" dur="5.94">left whatsoever and we have no</text>
  <text start="1035.5" dur="6.06">indication that the u.s. is buying any</text>
  <text start="1037.9" dur="6.12">gold at this time but if we look back at</text>
  <text start="1041.56" dur="5.58">World War two the US had the</text>
  <text start="1044.02" dur="5.43">manufacturing the u.s. kind of stole the</text>
  <text start="1047.14" dur="4.14">gold from the people then they took on</text>
  <text start="1049.45" dur="5.4">more gold from all the European nations</text>
  <text start="1051.28" dur="6.51">and they became the reserve currency of</text>
  <text start="1054.85" dur="7.88">the world the US has no manufacturing</text>
  <text start="1057.79" dur="9.17">left jobs are all outsourced overseas</text>
  <text start="1062.73" dur="6.64">the US has no gold why would anyone</text>
  <text start="1066.96" dur="6.34">trust the u.s. to restart the system</text>
  <text start="1069.37" dur="7.41">they wouldn&amp;#39;t they&amp;#39;re going to look to</text>
  <text start="1073.3" dur="7.5">another strong country that has</text>
  <text start="1076.78" dur="5.49">manufacturing that has gold and right</text>
  <text start="1080.8" dur="5.67">now we&amp;#39;re looking at Russia and</text>
  <text start="1082.27" dur="7.7">especially China at this point we see</text>
  <text start="1086.47" dur="7.8">the third quarter earnings seasons is</text>
  <text start="1089.97" dur="8.14">ending and we&amp;#39;re seeing that the third</text>
  <text start="1094.27" dur="7.07">quarter wiped out about 11 trillion off</text>
  <text start="1098.11" dur="7.86">the global economy it was a disaster a</text>
  <text start="1101.34" dur="6.88">complete disaster so over the last three</text>
  <text start="1105.97" dur="5.01">months the aggregated losses in global</text>
  <text start="1108.22" dur="5.52">stock markets markets exceeded 11</text>
  <text start="1110.98" dur="9.99">trillion dollars I mean it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1113.74" dur="12.18">unbelievable now since Obamacare was</text>
  <text start="1120.97" dur="7.47">brought in as the insurance for everyone</text>
  <text start="1125.92" dur="4.65">where they basically mandated that</text>
  <text start="1128.44" dur="4.229">everyone has to get some type of</text>
  <text start="1130.57" dur="3.51">insurance or you&amp;#39;re penalized then of</text>
  <text start="1132.669" dur="4.38">course as we know this is not a benefit</text>
  <text start="1134.08" dur="6.83">for the people we see that whatever</text>
  <text start="1137.049" dur="7.171">Obama has told us has not come true and</text>
  <text start="1140.91" dur="4.72">people are starting to get letters that</text>
  <text start="1144.22" dur="5.54">their premiums are going to start going</text>
  <text start="1145.63" dur="7.35">up I mean blue cross blue shield they</text>
  <text start="1149.76" dur="5.11">basically sent out letters saying that</text>
  <text start="1152.98" dur="8.25">their premiums are set to rise by sixty</text>
  <text start="1154.87" dur="7.559">percent now that&amp;#39;s quite a bit and this</text>
  <text start="1161.23" dur="3.689">is going to make it more and more</text>
  <text start="1162.429" dur="4.921">difficult for people to make ends meet</text>
  <text start="1164.919" dur="6.121">at for people to make ends meet because</text>
  <text start="1167.35" dur="9.69">if you look at a premium here of let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1171.04" dur="7.68">say 867 which someone was paying that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1177.04" dur="4.8">going to go up to one thousand three</text>
  <text start="1178.72" dur="4.62">hundred and sixty five dollars and of</text>
  <text start="1181.84" dur="4.26">course they don&amp;#39;t want to come out and</text>
  <text start="1183.34" dur="4.65">say well because of the supreme court</text>
  <text start="1186.1" dur="3.3">mandated tax known as Obamacare this is</text>
  <text start="1187.99" dur="3.84">why your premiums are going up they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1189.4" dur="5.88">blaming it on everything else actually</text>
  <text start="1191.83" dur="5.7">the letter states that be caught the</text>
  <text start="1195.28" dur="4.83">reason why they&amp;#39;re raising the premiums</text>
  <text start="1197.53" dur="5.37">is because Americans are living</text>
  <text start="1200.11" dur="5.189">healthier lives and because of these</text>
  <text start="1202.9" dur="4.47">changes we must adjust your premium to</text>
  <text start="1205.299" dur="3.571">stay in line with increased costs and</text>
  <text start="1207.37" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re saying the cost of all the</text>
  <text start="1208.87" dur="4.13">medication and people are living longer</text>
  <text start="1210.73" dur="5.18">and this is the reason they&amp;#39;re giving</text>
  <text start="1213" dur="6.19">well it&amp;#39;s strange so after Obama care</text>
  <text start="1215.91" dur="5.47">premiums are skyrocketing before</text>
  <text start="1219.19" dur="4.89">Obamacare we didn&amp;#39;t see anything like</text>
  <text start="1221.38" dur="5.4">this yes premiums did go up a little bit</text>
  <text start="1224.08" dur="4.41">but not like this actually the</text>
  <text start="1226.78" dur="4.59">Affordable Care Act told us it was going</text>
  <text start="1228.49" dur="6.21">to go down isn&amp;#39;t that what Obama told us</text>
  <text start="1231.37" dur="5.13">we&amp;#39;re not seeing this whatsoever and we</text>
  <text start="1234.7" dur="5.76">have to remember how this all occurred I</text>
  <text start="1236.5" dur="6.21">mean we had the insurance companies the</text>
  <text start="1240.46" dur="4.89">government officials or government</text>
  <text start="1242.71" dur="4.8">employees get together and said hey how</text>
  <text start="1245.35" dur="6.24">can we make a huge amount of money off</text>
  <text start="1247.51" dur="5.46">these people I know let&amp;#39;s tell them</text>
  <text start="1251.59" dur="5.73">we&amp;#39;ll give them all health insurance</text>
  <text start="1252.97" dur="6.21">will raise the deductibles and we won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1257.32" dur="4.14">really give them that many benefits but</text>
  <text start="1259.18" dur="4.47">will say everyone will get health</text>
  <text start="1261.46" dur="5.67">insurance to make everyone feel good</text>
  <text start="1263.65" dur="5.7">about it but what happens if people</text>
  <text start="1267.13" dur="4.049">decide they don&amp;#39;t want to do it well</text>
  <text start="1269.35" dur="4.02">then we&amp;#39;ll put a penalty on them and the</text>
  <text start="1271.179" dur="5.641">penalty will increase each year and it</text>
  <text start="1273.37" dur="6.09">will force them into the system and this</text>
  <text start="1276.82" dur="4.83">way the insurance companies they have no</text>
  <text start="1279.46" dur="4.5">competition they just keep the premiums</text>
  <text start="1281.65" dur="5.73">at one level and then they can all raise</text>
  <text start="1283.96" dur="6.39">it whenever they want and the taxes that</text>
  <text start="1287.38" dur="5.97">are intertwined in Obamacare goes to the</text>
  <text start="1290.35" dur="5.1">government for revenue and for those</text>
  <text start="1293.35" dur="4.5">people who are not in insured in the</text>
  <text start="1295.45" dur="5.4">health insurance they&amp;#39;re taxed and that</text>
  <text start="1297.85" dur="5.1">revenue goes to the government but we</text>
  <text start="1300.85" dur="4.86">see Obamacare is having a problem they</text>
  <text start="1302.95" dur="6.99">need 22 million more people to keep the</text>
  <text start="1305.71" dur="9.63">system alive we see Obamacare is</text>
  <text start="1309.94" dur="9.03">collapsing in many different areas but</text>
  <text start="1315.34" dur="9.54">as we know they&amp;#39;re continually pushing</text>
  <text start="1318.97" dur="7.589">the idea that we need this actually what</text>
  <text start="1324.88" dur="5.549">we need is something that benefits the</text>
  <text start="1326.559" dur="6.901">people we don&amp;#39;t need more taxes we need</text>
  <text start="1330.429" dur="5.701">to get rid of the central bank we need</text>
  <text start="1333.46" dur="6.99">to start taking control of our lives</text>
  <text start="1336.13" dur="6.299">again we need to replace those who are</text>
  <text start="1340.45" dur="3.72">not working for the people and those</text>
  <text start="1342.429" dur="4.291">people in the government need to step</text>
  <text start="1344.17" dur="5.85">down this is what really needs to happen</text>
  <text start="1346.72" dur="7.41">at this point because just talking about</text>
  <text start="1350.02" dur="5.4">it just hearing from all these</text>
  <text start="1354.13" dur="3.42">government employees saying they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1355.42" dur="5.25">going to do this and that we need to go</text>
  <text start="1357.55" dur="5.19">to the root of the problem and the root</text>
  <text start="1360.67" dur="5.24">of the problem is the central bankers</text>
  <text start="1362.74" dur="5.69">there&amp;#39;s no accountability</text>
  <text start="1365.91" dur="7.24">because all they&amp;#39;re doing is borrowing</text>
  <text start="1368.43" dur="7.78">borrowing borrowing from the central</text>
  <text start="1373.15" dur="5.85">bank and there&amp;#39;s interest attached on</text>
  <text start="1376.21" dur="6.09">that it can never be paid back it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1379" dur="6.38">impossible because every one dollar the</text>
  <text start="1382.3" dur="5.85">Fed gives they want let&amp;#39;s say to back</text>
  <text start="1385.38" dur="6.64">where do you get the other dollar if</text>
  <text start="1388.15" dur="6.5">it&amp;#39;s not created you can&amp;#39;t find it so</text>
  <text start="1392.02" dur="5.19">the Fed has to create more currency</text>
  <text start="1394.65" dur="5.71">which means the government has to borrow</text>
  <text start="1397.21" dur="8.52">the government has the billion has the</text>
  <text start="1400.36" dur="7.14">ability to create its own currency they</text>
  <text start="1405.73" dur="3.63">do not need the central bank actually</text>
  <text start="1407.5" dur="4.43">what benefit does the central bank gift</text>
  <text start="1409.36" dur="5.13">we haven&amp;#39;t seen any benefit whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1411.93" dur="4.99">so why do they keep the central bank in</text>
  <text start="1414.49" dur="6.3">power the only reason I can think of is</text>
  <text start="1416.92" dur="8.36">they&amp;#39;re getting kickbacks from the</text>
  <text start="1420.79" dur="7.53">central bank free money to keep them in</text>
  <text start="1425.28" dur="4.69">power listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
