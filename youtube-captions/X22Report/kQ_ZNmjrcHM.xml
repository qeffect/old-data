  <text start="145.049" dur="4.201">do and I want to do is border security</text>
  <text start="146.7" dur="6.84">and he wants the mainstream media to</text>
  <text start="149.25" dur="6.299">comment on it remember he&amp;#39;s getting the</text>
  <text start="153.54" dur="5.4">message out there that he&amp;#39;s taken an</text>
  <text start="155.549" dur="6.391">economy and accelerated it to a point</text>

  <text start="164.85" dur="4.02">doing fantastic and this is part of the</text>
  <text start="167.01" dur="3.41">plane and this is why he continually</text>
  <text start="168.87" dur="4.14">repeats because the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="170.42" dur="4.87">they&amp;#39;re not just gonna go ahead and put</text>
  <text start="173.01" dur="4.88">the story in there that Wow the economy</text>
  <text start="175.29" dur="6">is fantastic Thank You President Trump</text>
  <text start="177.89" dur="5.83">Trump needs to continually say it so the</text>
  <text start="181.29" dur="4.62">mainstream media puts it in their news</text>
  <text start="183.72" dur="3.6">reports and most of the time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="185.91" dur="3.06">contradicting and saying local fact</text>
  <text start="187.32" dur="3.3">Chuck let&amp;#39;s see if he has the best</text>
  <text start="188.97" dur="3.69">economy fact check let&amp;#39;s see if the</text>
  <text start="190.62" dur="4.56">economy is really doing a lot better he</text>
  <text start="192.66" dur="4.77">doesn&amp;#39;t care about that what he really</text>
  <text start="195.18" dur="4.29">wants he wants the mainstream media to</text>
  <text start="197.43" dur="4.11">continually put it out there because</text>
  <text start="199.47" dur="4.89">he&amp;#39;s controlling the narrative he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="201.54" dur="6.27">continually saying the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="204.36" dur="5.58">fantastic and this is on purpose it&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="207.81" dur="3.78">purpose because later on what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="209.94" dur="4.35">going to do is they&amp;#39;re going to blame it</text>
  <text start="211.59" dur="6.15">on the central banking system and I do</text>
  <text start="214.29" dur="8.07">believe that Trump and G and Putin they</text>
  <text start="217.74" dur="7.08">are all working together to attack the</text>
  <text start="222.36" dur="4.8">central bank system and this is not</text>
  <text start="224.82" dur="5.76">about tariffs this is not about ooh</text>
  <text start="227.16" dur="6.74">let&amp;#39;s put an even playing field this is</text>
  <text start="230.58" dur="6.24">about G and Trump coordinating together</text>
  <text start="233.9" dur="7">to bring down the central bank</text>
  <text start="236.82" dur="5.43">establishment and what they&amp;#39;re doing and</text>
  <text start="240.9" dur="4.08">remember the deep state let me just back</text>
  <text start="242.25" dur="4.26">up a little bit deep state they are in</text>
  <text start="244.98" dur="3.42">each one of these countries the central</text>
  <text start="246.51" dur="4.05">banks are in each one of these countries</text>
  <text start="248.4" dur="3.87">actually Putin has really taken control</text>
  <text start="250.56" dur="4.41">of the central bank in Russia they have</text>
  <text start="252.27" dur="4.26">hardly any debt whatsoever they dictate</text>
  <text start="254.97" dur="3.48">to the private western central bank in</text>
  <text start="256.53" dur="4.47">their country on what to do</text>
  <text start="258.45" dur="5.67">China the United States a little bit of</text>
  <text start="261" dur="7.05">different story and I believe that gee</text>
  <text start="264.12" dur="7.02">and Trump&amp;#39;s and China right now is a</text>
  <text start="268.05" dur="4.5">manufacturing powerhouse the deep state</text>
  <text start="271.14" dur="4.59">the central bank has been moving</text>
  <text start="272.55" dur="5.1">everything off into China those behind</text>
  <text start="275.73" dur="4.14">the scenes they were trying to build</text>
  <text start="277.65" dur="4.5">China up and I think G and Trump right</text>
  <text start="279.87" dur="4.74">now they&amp;#39;re working together to even out</text>
  <text start="282.15" dur="7.92">the playing field I don&amp;#39;t believe that</text>
  <text start="284.61" dur="7.44">G and the good guys in China want war or</text>
  <text start="290.07" dur="3.69">anything like that they want peace</text>
  <text start="292.05" dur="3.119">throughout the world I believe just like</text>
  <text start="293.76" dur="4.89">Russia and</text>
  <text start="295.169" dur="8.191">from and if you notice Putin during this</text>
  <text start="298.65" dur="6.66">time of Obama and moving forward they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="303.36" dur="3.72">always looking for peace they&amp;#39;re always</text>
  <text start="305.31" dur="3.21">trying to stop what the deep state is</text>
  <text start="307.08" dur="4.29">trying to do and we pointed this out</text>
  <text start="308.52" dur="5.04">many many times before and I do believe</text>
  <text start="311.37" dur="5.699">that they are coordinating and the</text>
  <text start="313.56" dur="6.9">tariffs are necessary right now to put</text>
  <text start="317.069" dur="6.75">pressure on those individuals in China</text>
  <text start="320.46" dur="7.41">and I believe that Trump is continually</text>
  <text start="323.819" dur="7.701">talking with the G evening the playing</text>
  <text start="327.87" dur="7.53">field preparing for the transition and</text>
  <text start="331.52" dur="5.919">they&amp;#39;re trying to do this while the deep</text>
  <text start="335.4" dur="5.569">state is there while the Central Bank is</text>
  <text start="337.439" dur="5.73">there now here in the United States just</text>
  <text start="340.969" dur="4.81">because you hear statistical information</text>
  <text start="343.169" dur="5.851">like industrial production is plunging</text>
  <text start="345.779" dur="5.19">it doesn&amp;#39;t mean manufacturing is not</text>
  <text start="349.02" dur="4.56">coming back to the United States what</text>
  <text start="350.969" dur="4.92">that means is manufacturing is coming</text>
  <text start="353.58" dur="3.75">back to the United States but the</text>
  <text start="355.889" dur="5.161">economy and this is the central bank</text>
  <text start="357.33" dur="7.679">economy is doing so poorly that it</text>
  <text start="361.05" dur="9.149">cannot produce enough because the demand</text>
  <text start="365.009" dur="8.101">isn&amp;#39;t there because the people of this</text>
  <text start="370.199" dur="5.58">economy are hurting because of the</text>
  <text start="373.11" dur="5.91">central bank because of what they put in</text>
  <text start="375.779" dur="4.831">place so when you hear this and you hear</text>
  <text start="379.02" dur="5.549">like industrial production plunge by</text>
  <text start="380.61" dur="5.549">0.6% month-on-month all this means is we</text>
  <text start="384.569" dur="4.83">have two things happening within this</text>
  <text start="386.159" dur="4.651">economy we have the central bank economy</text>
  <text start="389.399" dur="3.54">which is deteriorating not just here in</text>
  <text start="390.81" dur="4.079">the United States it&amp;#39;s deteriorating</text>
  <text start="392.939" dur="3.391">around the world think about what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="394.889" dur="5.071">seeing right now and you&amp;#39;re seeing this</text>
  <text start="396.33" dur="7.53">in real-time Europe with all the</text>
  <text start="399.96" dur="6.629">different nations within the EU they are</text>
  <text start="403.86" dur="7.2">headed into a recession the United</text>
  <text start="406.589" dur="7.17">States they have the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="411.06" dur="3.829">which can continually print and print or</text>
  <text start="413.759" dur="5.46">just push a button and create it</text>
  <text start="414.889" dur="8.981">electronically and continually feed this</text>
  <text start="419.219" dur="8.94">system the nations within the EU they</text>
  <text start="423.87" dur="4.819">have to ask to borrow more and the EU</text>
  <text start="428.159" dur="3.88">says</text>
  <text start="428.689" dur="6.48">yes or no or the IMF says yes or no here</text>
  <text start="432.039" dur="5.14">in the United States all they say is</text>
  <text start="435.169" dur="3.84">listen we need more give it to us and</text>
  <text start="437.179" dur="3.54">that&amp;#39;s all that happens</text>
  <text start="439.009" dur="4.29">forget about the debt ceiling forget</text>
  <text start="440.719" dur="5.97">about all that other stuff in reality</text>
  <text start="443.299" dur="5.73">that&amp;#39;s what happens now just because you</text>
  <text start="446.689" dur="3.09">see the United States doing really</text>
  <text start="449.029" dur="3.89">really well</text>
  <text start="449.779" dur="5.91">it doesn&amp;#39;t mean it is really doing well</text>
  <text start="452.919" dur="6.31">this is an illusion Trump has the magic</text>
  <text start="455.689" dur="6.21">wand he&amp;#39;s using it against the central</text>
  <text start="459.229" dur="4.86">bank against the deep state against all</text>
  <text start="461.899" dur="5.34">these players but he has to keep it</text>
  <text start="464.089" dur="5.45">going long enough to get to a second</text>
  <text start="467.239" dur="5.25">term and this is why q has told us</text>
  <text start="469.539" dur="4.72">listen we know what the bad guys in the</text>
  <text start="472.489" dur="3.9">Federal Reserve are up to we know what</text>
  <text start="474.259" dur="3.48">the deep state is up to we know that</text>
  <text start="476.389" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re planning on bringing down the</text>
  <text start="477.739" dur="4.7">economy right before the election I mean</text>
  <text start="480.439" dur="4.68">this would been this would have been a</text>
  <text start="482.439" dur="4.75">fantastic plan by the central bank by</text>
  <text start="485.119" dur="3.96">the deep state because Trump all along</text>
  <text start="487.189" dur="4.29">saying the economy&amp;#39;s doing well all of a</text>
  <text start="489.079" dur="2.91">sudden it crashes when they say see we</text>
  <text start="491.479" dur="3.36">told you</text>
  <text start="491.989" dur="4.77">Trump was wrong the economy crashed do</text>
  <text start="494.839" dur="4.62">you really want him to handle the</text>
  <text start="496.759" dur="5.28">economy moving forward and Trump would</text>
  <text start="499.459" dur="3.6">have been in trouble during the 2020</text>
  <text start="502.039" dur="2.58">elections because they would have had</text>
  <text start="503.059" dur="4.26">they would have done it right before</text>
  <text start="504.619" dur="5.61">that just like in 2008 when we had</text>
  <text start="507.319" dur="4.801">McCain and Obama McCain they didn&amp;#39;t Phil</text>
  <text start="510.229" dur="2.81">hit they didn&amp;#39;t fill him in and what was</text>
  <text start="512.12" dur="5.519">gonna happen</text>
  <text start="513.039" dur="6.52">Obama he was tipped off he knew that the</text>
  <text start="517.639" dur="3.541">economy was going to come down and he</text>
  <text start="519.559" dur="4.17">said listen the economy is not doing</text>
  <text start="521.18" dur="5.159">great the economy&amp;#39;s terrible and all of</text>
  <text start="523.729" dur="6.001">a sudden it crashed and a McCain thought</text>
  <text start="526.339" dur="7.761">everything was fine and it went right to</text>
  <text start="529.73" dur="7.56">Obama boom slam dunk no problem there</text>
  <text start="534.1" dur="5.099">queue has been telling us that they</text>
  <text start="537.29" dur="5.519">already know the plan</text>
  <text start="539.199" dur="5.401">Trump is continually repeating over and</text>
  <text start="542.809" dur="5.041">over that the economy is doing well</text>
  <text start="544.6" dur="5.349">because we have both sides where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="547.85" dur="5.099">gonna try to push their plan remember</text>
  <text start="549.949" dur="5.341">Trump he has control of the Federal</text>
  <text start="552.949" dur="6.091">Reserve I do believe this you can see</text>
  <text start="555.29" dur="7.14">that when Trump says listen don&amp;#39;t raise</text>
  <text start="559.04" dur="7.44">rates don&amp;#39;t do this Powell is listening</text>
  <text start="562.43" dur="6.45">and he had to contradict the Fed during</text>
  <text start="566.48" dur="4.56">this period of time to build a narrative</text>
  <text start="568.88" dur="5.49">that it&amp;#39;s the feds fault</text>
  <text start="571.04" dur="5.85">if something happens now something very</text>
  <text start="574.37" dur="4.589">interesting we know that G and Trump</text>
  <text start="576.89" dur="6.449">they&amp;#39;re going to me we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="578.959" dur="7.471">gonna iron out a trade deal but China to</text>
  <text start="583.339" dur="4.171">help the United States to help to keep</text>
  <text start="586.43" dur="4.59">the economy going</text>
  <text start="587.51" dur="7.47">all of a sudden China unleashed a</text>
  <text start="591.02" dur="7.14">gargantuan credit injection to start</text>
  <text start="594.98" dur="6.9">this year which means the central bank</text>
  <text start="598.16" dur="6.69">is printing like crazy and they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="601.88" dur="6.149">this on purpose I believe G and Trump</text>
  <text start="604.85" dur="7.77">they coordinated this effort to keep the</text>
  <text start="608.029" dur="7.411">economy moving along because more of</text>
  <text start="612.62" dur="5.82">this that&amp;#39;s out there the more printing</text>
  <text start="615.44" dur="5.16">that China does China looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="618.44" dur="5.839">doing a lot better it helps the United</text>
  <text start="620.6" dur="6.84">States will it help Europe a little bit</text>
  <text start="624.279" dur="5.051">we know this is only a temporary fix and</text>
  <text start="627.44" dur="3.51">I believe they&amp;#39;re doing this and they</text>
  <text start="629.33" dur="6.24">started up the printing presses right</text>
  <text start="630.95" dur="8.579">now to push us through 2020 to help the</text>
  <text start="635.57" dur="7.11">situation this is part of the plan drive</text>
  <text start="639.529" dur="6.93">the central bank economy to the very</text>
  <text start="642.68" dur="7.49">edge so what did China start to do here</text>
  <text start="646.459" dur="6.151">well this is what happened in January</text>
  <text start="650.17" dur="4.87">Chinese financial institutions made a</text>
  <text start="652.61" dur="6.45">record three point two three trillion</text>
  <text start="655.04" dur="7.98">yuan of new loans versus a projected</text>

  <text start="663.02" dur="4.77">any month back to 1992 when the data</text>
  <text start="666.079" dur="3.601">began and represented a whopping</text>
  <text start="667.79" dur="5.46">thirteen point four percent year-on-year</text>
  <text start="669.68" dur="6.27">increase in January but while the surge</text>
  <text start="673.25" dur="4.62">in new loans was impressive it was</text>
  <text start="675.95" dur="3.9">nothing compared to what China reported</text>
  <text start="677.87" dur="4.95">in its broader all encompassing</text>
  <text start="679.85" dur="6.15">aggregate financing which exploded</text>
  <text start="682.82" dur="5.1">nearly three fold from December&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="686" dur="4.52">point five nine trillion to an</text>

  <text start="690.52" dur="7.29">trillion in the month of January</text>
  <text start="695.08" dur="4.59">smashing expectations of 3.3 1 trillion</text>
  <text start="697.81" dur="4.56">and printing far above the highs</text>
  <text start="699.67" dur="4.83">forecast from 26 economists of three</text>
  <text start="702.37" dur="4.23">point nine trillion this was as several</text>
  <text start="704.5" dur="5.7">traders noted nothing short of a</text>
  <text start="706.6" dur="6.27">gargantuan credit injection an obvious</text>
  <text start="710.2" dur="6.66">greenlight to China&amp;#39;s latest attempt to</text>
  <text start="712.87" dur="7.02">reflate its economy and I do believe</text>
  <text start="716.86" dur="7.2">this was a coordinated effort between</text>
  <text start="719.89" dur="6.569">Trump and G to keep this system alive to</text>
  <text start="724.06" dur="5.13">kick it down the road a little bit</text>
  <text start="726.459" dur="5.221">longer to get past the 2020 elections</text>
  <text start="729.19" dur="5.07">remember this is all planned out and</text>
  <text start="731.68" dur="5.46">they need to keep the economy going if</text>
  <text start="734.26" dur="6.6">China fell it would have brought the</text>
  <text start="737.14" dur="7.56">United States down with it this could</text>
  <text start="740.86" dur="6.69">not happen so Trump and G they needed a</text>
  <text start="744.7" dur="6.42">plan to keep the economy going because</text>
  <text start="747.55" dur="6.81">if China fell the United States would</text>
  <text start="751.12" dur="5.76">implode on itself they the United States</text>
  <text start="754.36" dur="8.13">Europe the rest of the world would fall</text>
  <text start="756.88" dur="8.19">apart so I believe that Trump and G they</text>
  <text start="762.49" dur="5.67">coordinate their efforts they started</text>
  <text start="765.07" dur="5.49">the printing presses in China and Trump</text>
  <text start="768.16" dur="4.35">here is continually manipulating these</text>
  <text start="770.56" dur="3.779">statistics using the magic wand just</text>
  <text start="772.51" dur="2.85">like the deep state the central banks</text>
  <text start="774.339" dur="4.74">have been doing for a very very long</text>
  <text start="775.36" dur="7.89">time China is helping out in their way</text>
  <text start="779.079" dur="7.741">yes they&amp;#39;re coordinating deals removing</text>
  <text start="783.25" dur="7.77">tariffs evening out the trade between</text>
  <text start="786.82" dur="7.889">the two countries this is necessary for</text>
  <text start="791.02" dur="6.87">moving forward so it looks like G and</text>
  <text start="794.709" dur="5.94">Trump they are working together to hold</text>
  <text start="797.89" dur="7.23">the economy together so the central bank</text>
  <text start="800.649" dur="8.43">economy does not fall apart before the</text>
  <text start="805.12" dur="6.12">elections remember Q has told us they</text>
  <text start="809.079" dur="3.661">know the plan they know exactly what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="811.24" dur="4.409">going on and we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="812.74" dur="6.15">Fed is holding off they haven&amp;#39;t raised</text>
  <text start="815.649" dur="6.151">interest rates even though the economy</text>
  <text start="818.89" dur="5.55">is doing better than ever</text>
  <text start="821.8" dur="6.68">there&amp;#39;d be no reason to hold off if the</text>
  <text start="824.44" dur="6.39">economy is truly doing incredibly well</text>
  <text start="828.48" dur="4.09">the only reason the Fed would hold off</text>
  <text start="830.83" dur="6.48">is because they know this is illusion</text>
  <text start="832.57" dur="7.05">they know that Trump is manipulating all</text>
  <text start="837.31" dur="5.22">the data and Trump is telling them</text>
  <text start="839.62" dur="6.45">listen we can&amp;#39;t have this happen right</text>
  <text start="842.53" dur="6.36">now so you need to stop it and this is</text>
  <text start="846.07" dur="6.12">exactly what Trump did but he needed the</text>
  <text start="848.89" dur="6.12">Fed to raise the rates like they planned</text>
  <text start="852.19" dur="4.44">before he got into office because if you</text>
  <text start="855.01" dur="5.16">notice they started raising the rates at</text>
  <text start="856.63" dur="4.41">the end of 2016 like in the middle of</text>
  <text start="860.17" dur="2.07">2016</text>
  <text start="861.04" dur="2.85">yeah they raised it once in the</text>
  <text start="862.24" dur="3.66">beginning but as soon as he became</text>
  <text start="863.89" dur="3.96">elected what did they do they started</text>
  <text start="865.9" dur="4.29">raising it very very quickly because</text>
  <text start="867.85" dur="5.52">they wanted to start the domino effect</text>
  <text start="870.19" dur="5.91">of the economy falling apart Trump the</text>
  <text start="873.37" dur="4.79">Patriots they knew this and this is why</text>
  <text start="876.1" dur="4.74">when this is when Powell got into office</text>
  <text start="878.16" dur="5.11">everything started to change he started</text>
  <text start="880.84" dur="4.53">to criticize and contradict a Fed but he</text>
  <text start="883.27" dur="4.65">still wanted the Fed to raise the rates</text>
  <text start="885.37" dur="4.11">this way he could he could contradict</text>
  <text start="887.92" dur="5.22">them and show that the Fed is</text>
  <text start="889.48" dur="5.04">responsible for the economy imploding</text>
  <text start="893.14" dur="3.99">every time they raise the rates he</text>
  <text start="894.52" dur="5.19">wanted to build that narrative now we</text>
  <text start="897.13" dur="4.77">see the Fed is not raising rates in an</text>
  <text start="899.71" dur="6.21">economy that&amp;#39;s doing very well so I do</text>
  <text start="901.9" dur="6.03">believe right now they planned out on</text>
  <text start="905.92" dur="4.74">how they were going to keep the economy</text>
  <text start="907.93" dur="5.22">going to right after the elections</text>
  <text start="910.66" dur="5.22">because once the elections are you know</text>
  <text start="913.15" dur="6">all said and done in 2020 and Trump is</text>
  <text start="915.88" dur="5.64">reelected Trump everything that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="919.15" dur="4.53">holding him back there&amp;#39;s nothing holding</text>
  <text start="921.52" dur="4.32">him back anymore he can start the</text>
  <text start="923.68" dur="6.06">transition process he can start the</text>
  <text start="925.84" dur="5.64">entire process and before that time</text>
  <text start="929.74" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re going to see a rest we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="931.48" dur="5.37">see many other things think about if he</text>
  <text start="933.34" dur="8.19">arrests or brings the D class into the</text>
  <text start="936.85" dur="7.8">open right before the election and the</text>
  <text start="941.53" dur="7.41">economy doesn&amp;#39;t fall apart an economy</text>
  <text start="944.65" dur="7.38">still does well well Trump he&amp;#39;d have no</text>
  <text start="948.94" dur="7.53">problem getting into office the second</text>
  <text start="952.03" dur="6.2">time and I believe his second term this</text>
  <text start="956.47" dur="4.17">is when we&amp;#39;ll be going through a major</text>
