  <text start="42.57" dur="4.14">economic collapse continues US companies</text>
  <text start="45.03" dur="4.32">announced the most first quarter layo</text>
  <text start="46.71" dur="4.199">since 2009 now when we look at the</text>
  <text start="49.35" dur="3">market we see the market has been</text>
  <text start="50.909" dur="5.04">bobbing up and down we go back to</text>
  <text start="52.35" dur="5.94">January 2016 we started out the year way</text>
  <text start="55.949" dur="5.28">down and they pumped the market back up</text>
  <text start="58.29" dur="5.79">and we&amp;#39;ve been in the green we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="61.229" dur="4.621">down in the negative area gold same</text>
  <text start="64.08" dur="3.78">thing and they&amp;#39;re just trying to keep</text>
  <text start="65.85" dur="4.23">the system completely stable now I was</text>
  <text start="67.86" dur="3.75">talking to someone today and we were</text>
  <text start="70.08" dur="3.329">talking about the market and they were</text>
  <text start="71.61" dur="3.84">telling me how the market and many</text>
  <text start="73.409" dur="4.35">people believe this that the market</text>
  <text start="75.45" dur="5.07">shows how the economy is doing its the</text>
  <text start="77.759" dur="5.011">gauge of how the economy is doing and I</text>
  <text start="80.52" dur="5.94">said really does the market actually</text>
  <text start="82.77" dur="6.63">really tell us how the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="86.46" dur="3.9">because if we go back in time I mean we</text>
  <text start="89.4" dur="3.75">can go all the way back to nineteen</text>
  <text start="90.36" dur="5.49">twenty nine the stock market was at</text>
  <text start="93.15" dur="4.95">all-time highs and at that point</text>
  <text start="95.85" dur="4.53">everyone thought yeah the economy is</text>
  <text start="98.1" dur="5.82">doing well there&amp;#39;s no problems and then</text>
  <text start="100.38" dur="7.949">one day in October the market came</text>
  <text start="103.92" dur="8.189">crashing down when we look back at 2008</text>
  <text start="108.329" dur="6.36">we were at all-time highs of what 14,000</text>
  <text start="112.109" dur="4.771">points or so people thought whoa look at</text>
  <text start="114.689" dur="4.831">the economy it&amp;#39;s doing fantastic the</text>
  <text start="116.88" dur="4.559">markets up at 14,000 everything is fine</text>
  <text start="119.52" dur="3.57">the Fed is telling us everything is fine</text>
  <text start="121.439" dur="2.761">the US government is telling us</text>
  <text start="123.09" dur="3.739">everything is fine everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="124.2" dur="4.949">contained nothing to worry about and</text>
  <text start="126.829" dur="5.951">people went about their business and all</text>
  <text start="129.149" dur="8.221">of a sudden one day in October all of a</text>
  <text start="132.78" dur="6.42">sudden the market crashed and all of a</text>
  <text start="137.37" dur="4.02">sudden we hear from many companies angle</text>
  <text start="139.2" dur="3.93">we looks time it looks like it&amp;#39;s time to</text>
  <text start="141.39" dur="4.25">start laying off some people here</text>
  <text start="143.13" dur="5.7">because the economy is not doing well</text>
  <text start="145.64" dur="7.27">well the economy just didn&amp;#39;t switch on a</text>
  <text start="148.83" dur="8.22">dime here what was happening all prior</text>
  <text start="152.91" dur="7.65">to this was that the economy every</text>
  <text start="157.05" dur="6.33">single day up to that point was slowly</text>
  <text start="160.56" dur="4.319">deteriorating getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="163.38" dur="4.23">and worse</text>
  <text start="164.879" dur="5.14">because what these central bankers do is</text>
  <text start="167.61" dur="5.26">they continually pump up the market</text>
  <text start="170.019" dur="5.22">anyway they possibly can of course it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="172.87" dur="5.369">better when they get the American people</text>
  <text start="175.239" dur="5.25">involved in their bubbles this way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="178.239" dur="5.941">it&amp;#39;s a better crash for them and they</text>
  <text start="180.489" dur="5.61">don&amp;#39;t have to create money like we saw</text>
  <text start="184.18" dur="4.529">them do actually I say create currency</text>
  <text start="186.099" dur="5.431">like we saw them do after 2008 because</text>
  <text start="188.709" dur="5.971">prior to that they were they were able</text>
  <text start="191.53" dur="6.81">to get the American people into real</text>
  <text start="194.68" dur="5.88">estate into purchasing items and they</text>
  <text start="198.34" dur="4.35">were able to continually pump the bubble</text>
  <text start="200.56" dur="4.89">up until the very last moment in 2008</text>
  <text start="202.69" dur="4.17">this time the problem was the American</text>
  <text start="205.45" dur="5.429">people are completely tapped out they</text>
  <text start="206.86" dur="6.629">don&amp;#39;t have the funds to push the bubbles</text>
  <text start="210.879" dur="8.161">to new heights now in some areas like</text>
  <text start="213.489" dur="7.59">student loans like auto loans they were</text>
  <text start="219.04" dur="5.97">able to create these bubbles then</text>
  <text start="221.079" dur="6.931">remember these loans are not the</text>
  <text start="225.01" dur="6.69">people&amp;#39;s money not the people&amp;#39;s currency</text>
  <text start="228.01" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re borrowing this and if the</text>
  <text start="231.7" dur="4.83">government or the central bank&amp;#39;s allow</text>
  <text start="233.95" dur="5.45">people to borrow no matter if they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="236.53" dur="6.63">subprime people are going to do it and</text>
  <text start="239.4" dur="6.58">of course this is not your savings this</text>
  <text start="243.16" dur="5.52">is a loan and we see a lot of these</text>
  <text start="245.98" dur="3.99">loans are becoming delinquent a lot of</text>
  <text start="248.68" dur="4.95">the people that have gone to college</text>
  <text start="249.97" dur="7.049">graduated can&amp;#39;t find jobs their loans</text>
  <text start="253.63" dur="7.759">have been modified but for other parts</text>
  <text start="257.019" dur="8.611">of the market like retail manufacturing</text>
  <text start="261.389" dur="8.53">housing the people are sitting on the</text>
  <text start="265.63" dur="8.13">sidelines here because they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="269.919" dur="6.951">laid off they can&amp;#39;t find the full time</text>
  <text start="273.76" dur="5.82">job they once had with the same pay and</text>
  <text start="276.87" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re very nervous about the future</text>
  <text start="279.58" dur="5.28">and we can see that from the Gallup poll</text>
  <text start="282.45" dur="4.42">where they&amp;#39;re saying that economic</text>
  <text start="284.86" dur="3.27">confidence has fallen if we look at the</text>
  <text start="286.87" dur="4.68">government poll it shows us that</text>
  <text start="288.13" dur="6.99">everything is fine but when we look at</text>
  <text start="291.55" dur="5.73">this we can see why the central bankers</text>
  <text start="295.12" dur="3.449">loved to have the participation of the</text>
  <text start="297.28" dur="4.199">American people in there Bob</text>
  <text start="298.569" dur="4.74">it makes it easier for them after 2008</text>
  <text start="301.479" dur="3.18">since they didn&amp;#39;t have the participation</text>
  <text start="303.309" dur="4.22">of the American people what did they</text>
  <text start="304.659" dur="7.5">have to do that it create them by</text>
  <text start="307.529" dur="8.021">printing currency and they had to do a</text>
  <text start="312.159" dur="5.611">lot of this and they had a give it to</text>
  <text start="315.55" dur="6.419">banks they had a give it to hedge fund&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="317.77" dur="6.119">investment companies the interest rates</text>
  <text start="321.969" dur="5.4">are very very low so they could use this</text>
  <text start="323.889" dur="7.34">money in all different areas and like</text>
  <text start="327.369" dur="6.17">buying thousands upon thousands of homes</text>
  <text start="331.229" dur="4.9">renting them out holding on to them</text>
  <text start="333.539" dur="4.99">banks would take the money and they</text>
  <text start="336.129" dur="4.59">would put it into the market after the</text>
  <text start="338.529" dur="4.11">Fed came in and bought up their toxic</text>
  <text start="340.719" dur="5.28">real estate and they were able to pump</text>
  <text start="342.639" dur="5.43">up the market with this free money they</text>
  <text start="345.999" dur="6.27">make a profit they return the money no</text>
  <text start="348.069" dur="7.32">interest everything&amp;#39;s good to go and we</text>
  <text start="352.269" dur="4.98">can see the difference here before two</text>
  <text start="355.389" dur="5.61">thousand eight the people were included</text>
  <text start="357.249" dur="6.89">in the bubbles after 2008 it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="360.999" dur="6.42">central bank that&amp;#39;s creating the bubbles</text>
  <text start="364.139" dur="6.31">yes there are some foreign investors</text>
  <text start="367.419" dur="4.83">involved but mostly it is the central</text>
  <text start="370.449" dur="3.99">bank that is creating these bubbles this</text>
  <text start="372.249" dur="4.59">is why they can&amp;#39;t do anything with the</text>
  <text start="374.439" dur="5.91">retail market this is why we see stores</text>
  <text start="376.839" dur="7.08">closing this is why we see people having</text>
  <text start="380.349" dur="5.1">problems finding jobs these are certain</text>
  <text start="383.919" dur="3.78">things they can&amp;#39;t do yes they can</text>
  <text start="385.449" dur="5.43">manipulate the numbers they have the</text>
  <text start="387.699" dur="5.46">ability to do this but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="390.879" dur="4.861">right now is they don&amp;#39;t have the ability</text>
  <text start="393.159" dur="5.4">to touch certain markets and this is why</text>
  <text start="395.74" dur="5.279">we have such a disconnect today this is</text>
  <text start="398.559" dur="5.28">why people don&amp;#39;t understand what is</text>
  <text start="401.019" dur="6.6">going on they can touch the stock market</text>
  <text start="403.839" dur="7.29">they can touch precious metals they can</text>
  <text start="407.619" dur="7.94">touch GDP unemployment statistical</text>
  <text start="411.129" dur="10.82">numbers they can&amp;#39;t touch reality though</text>
  <text start="415.559" dur="9.491">that&amp;#39;s the main problem they can&amp;#39;t touch</text>
  <text start="421.949" dur="5.38">reality and what I mean by this they</text>
  <text start="425.05" dur="6.029">can&amp;#39;t touch the physical market of</text>
  <text start="427.329" dur="5.131">retail they can&amp;#39;t all of a sudden give</text>
  <text start="431.079" dur="4.021">free money to a bank and say you</text>
  <text start="432.46" dur="4.98">what go out and purchase as much as you</text>
  <text start="435.1" dur="5.76">possibly can from all the stores around</text>
  <text start="437.44" dur="6.24">the country it just doesn&amp;#39;t work real</text>
  <text start="440.86" dur="4.95">estate they can say listen you hedge</text>
  <text start="443.68" dur="5.45">funds you investment companies take this</text>
  <text start="445.81" dur="6.359">free money by up thousands of houses</text>
  <text start="449.13" dur="4.9">banks don&amp;#39;t foreclose on a lot of the</text>
  <text start="452.169" dur="4.831">homes keep them off the market let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="454.03" dur="7.949">drive the prices up in 20 cities it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="457" dur="6.99">lot easier to do that and with GDP they</text>
  <text start="461.979" dur="5.271">can manipulate those numbers but they</text>
  <text start="463.99" dur="6.84">can&amp;#39;t explain why manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="467.25" dur="6.789">declining because they can&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="470.83" dur="5.78">factories produce they just don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="474.039" dur="6.151">the ability to to do that in reality and</text>
  <text start="476.61" dur="5.95">this is why all of this is disconnected</text>
  <text start="480.19" dur="5.43">at this point this is why people are</text>
  <text start="482.56" dur="5.16">having a problem taking what is</text>
  <text start="485.62" dur="3.479">happening and understanding because</text>
  <text start="487.72" dur="2.55">they&amp;#39;re looking at the stock market</text>
  <text start="489.099" dur="5.671">they&amp;#39;re looking at the statistical</text>
  <text start="490.27" dur="8.67">numbers but everything else reality the</text>
  <text start="494.77" dur="8.429">central bank just can&amp;#39;t touch at this</text>
  <text start="498.94" dur="6.39">point and this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>
  <text start="503.199" dur="6.03">real economic indicators what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="505.33" dur="6.57">going on what&amp;#39;s really happening and the</text>
  <text start="509.229" dur="5.221">illusion and these two things are moving</text>
  <text start="511.9" dur="6.03">further and further away and as they</text>
  <text start="514.45" dur="6.509">move further and further away it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="517.93" dur="6">to be much harder for the US government</text>
  <text start="520.959" dur="5.07">central bankers to keep the illusion</text>
  <text start="523.93" dur="7.469">alive and they know this they understand</text>
  <text start="526.029" dur="6.901">it and this is why they&amp;#39;re rushing this</text>
  <text start="531.399" dur="3.121">is why they&amp;#39;re in overdrive at this</text>
  <text start="532.93" dur="4.2">point because they have a certain period</text>
  <text start="534.52" dur="6.93">of time before something might happen</text>
  <text start="537.13" dur="7.079">that might just bring the entire system</text>
  <text start="541.45" dur="5.73">down let&amp;#39;s get right into the economic</text>
  <text start="544.209" dur="6.151">collapse financial news now yesterday we</text>
  <text start="547.18" dur="5.73">talked about the eurozone and we talked</text>
  <text start="550.36" dur="5.219">about how the consumer confidence has</text>
  <text start="552.91" dur="6.33">dropped and we&amp;#39;re at the lowest level in</text>
  <text start="555.579" dur="7.711">more than a year right now S&amp;amp;P came out</text>
  <text start="559.24" dur="5.89">and they&amp;#39;re discussing the eurozone how</text>
  <text start="563.29" dur="3.97">the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="565.13" dur="7.19">and they have a warning that Europe&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="567.26" dur="7.53">key economy is now flying on one engine</text>
  <text start="572.32" dur="7.08">which is quite scary when you&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="574.79" dur="8.58">plane because if that engine goes out</text>
  <text start="579.4" dur="8.29">you&amp;#39;re done and this is what we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="583.37" dur="7.23">to see at this point because nothing has</text>
  <text start="587.69" dur="5.48">improved nothing&amp;#39;s changed yes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="590.6" dur="6.42">seeing little dead cat bounces in</text>
  <text start="593.17" dur="5.56">certain areas things have to pick up</text>
  <text start="597.02" dur="4.26">sometimes and then they drop off once</text>
  <text start="598.73" dur="7.02">again because yet to remember the world</text>
  <text start="601.28" dur="6.93">is still operating stores still order</text>
  <text start="605.75" dur="3.51">things there might be less of the things</text>
  <text start="608.21" dur="2.61">that they&amp;#39;re ordering but what they do</text>
  <text start="609.26" dur="3.9">is they deplete whatever they have and</text>
  <text start="610.82" dur="4.08">then they put in a smaller order and we</text>
  <text start="613.16" dur="3.87">see a bounce up of all they&amp;#39;re all you</text>
  <text start="614.9" dur="4.56">know manufacturing we see a bounce up of</text>
  <text start="617.03" dur="4.14">maybe the bolts dry index and things</text>
  <text start="619.46" dur="4.08">like that but then once again what</text>
  <text start="621.17" dur="5.73">happens is ok I have what I need and</text>
  <text start="623.54" dur="5.31">they no longer order maybe people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="626.9" dur="5.28">purchasing at this time so we go a</text>
  <text start="628.85" dur="5.88">longer period where everything starts to</text>
  <text start="632.18" dur="5.13">decline once again we never get back to</text>
  <text start="634.73" dur="8.94">that period of where everything is okay</text>
  <text start="637.31" dur="9.08">and when we look at unemployment we</text>
  <text start="643.67" dur="8.22">realize that as more and more people</text>
  <text start="646.39" dur="9.63">lose their jobs we&amp;#39;re going to see less</text>
  <text start="651.89" dur="6.54">purchasing in retail less manufacturing</text>
  <text start="656.02" dur="6.88">the Baltic Dry Index will most likely</text>
  <text start="658.43" dur="6.47">drop once again and this will continue</text>
  <text start="662.9" dur="5.97">because what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is</text>
  <text start="664.9" dur="10.33">that unemployment around the country</text>
  <text start="668.87" dur="8.46">around the world is moving upward where</text>
  <text start="675.23" dur="6.09">more and more people are losing their</text>
  <text start="677.33" dur="5.37">jobs and we can see that the is M</text>
  <text start="681.32" dur="4.46">manufacturing and the services</text>
  <text start="682.7" dur="6.24">employment and is&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;ve collapsed</text>
  <text start="685.78" dur="9.01">we&amp;#39;re seeing endless headlines of</text>
  <text start="688.94" dur="9.45">layoffs challenger gray &amp;amp; christmas are</text>
  <text start="694.79" dur="4.589">noting that the first quarter of this</text>

  <text start="726.679" dur="7.02">losing their jobs and they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="731.169" dur="4.39">under a certain number of hours like 25</text>
  <text start="733.699" dur="3.39">hours or so each state is a little</text>
  <text start="735.559" dur="4.35">different where they might have 30 hours</text>
  <text start="737.089" dur="5.31">some might have 25 and they&amp;#39;re making a</text>
  <text start="739.909" dur="5.01">certain dollar amount they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="742.399" dur="4.17">counted as layoffs another had a</text>
  <text start="744.919" dur="4.5">part-time job we&amp;#39;re not going to count</text>
  <text start="746.569" dur="5.01">them but if someone gets that part time</text>
  <text start="749.419" dur="4.53">job they&amp;#39;re counted as having a</text>
  <text start="751.579" dur="5.25">full-time job in the unemployment</text>
  <text start="753.949" dur="4.68">statistics and this is how they</text>
  <text start="756.829" dur="4.23">manipulate a lot of this information</text>
  <text start="758.629" dur="4.71">today and this is why people are very</text>
  <text start="761.059" dur="5.55">confused now through the first quarter</text>
  <text start="763.339" dur="5.79">of 2016 employers are announced a</text>
  <text start="766.609" dur="6.39">hundred and eighty-four thousand nine</text>
  <text start="769.129" dur="6.36">hundred and twenty job cuts up 31.8</text>
  <text start="772.999" dur="6.5">percent from the hundred and forty</text>
  <text start="775.489" dur="9.63">thousand that they saw back in 2015 at</text>
  <text start="779.499" dur="9.64">this time so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="785.119" dur="7.49">is that the number of layoffs is growing</text>
  <text start="789.139" dur="7.05">and it&amp;#39;s getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="792.609" dur="7.56">blackrock is laying off 400 people bae</text>
  <text start="796.189" dur="8.43">systems is laying off 170 BP in Houston</text>
  <text start="800.169" dur="7.6">500 plus and we continually see more and</text>
  <text start="804.619" dur="6.69">more layoffs and they&amp;#39;re getting closer</text>
  <text start="807.769" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re getting larger and you know what</text>
  <text start="811.309" dur="5.22">happens when the market comes crashing</text>
  <text start="813.019" dur="7.17">down companies go all out and say okay</text>
  <text start="816.529" dur="6.09">now we gotta clean house because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="820.189" dur="3.84">admitting there&amp;#39;s a problem and we need</text>
  <text start="822.619" dur="4.62">to lay off people this is what happened</text>
  <text start="824.029" dur="6.48">in 2008 all of a sudden we saw everyone</text>
  <text start="827.239" dur="5.881">being laid off we&amp;#39;re going to see this</text>
  <text start="830.509" dur="5.071">again what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="833.12" dur="4.71">I mean down right now they&amp;#39;re doing what</text>
  <text start="835.58" dur="4.92">the central bank wants get rid of the</text>
  <text start="837.83" dur="5.19">people lower your costs take those funds</text>
  <text start="840.5" dur="5.01">buy back your stocks pump up the market</text>
  <text start="843.02" dur="6.09">and this is what we&amp;#39;ve been seeing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="845.51" dur="8.73">the same cycle and we know revenue we no</text>
  <text start="849.11" dur="9.18">sales are all down in these companies so</text>
  <text start="854.24" dur="6.81">the market at this point is completely</text>
  <text start="858.29" dur="6.69">manipulated with buybacks with banks</text>
  <text start="861.05" dur="5.729">stuffing money into the market with high</text>
  <text start="864.98" dur="6.27">frequency trading plunge protection</text>
  <text start="866.779" dur="8.011">teams this is not an open free market</text>
  <text start="871.25" dur="6.779">this is a manipulated market now we see</text>
  <text start="874.79" dur="5.58">the chicago PMI it is jump back to 53.6</text>
  <text start="878.029" dur="5.791">in march which is better than expected</text>
  <text start="880.37" dur="6.75">but remains below the january 55.5 highs</text>
  <text start="883.82" dur="7.53">and we can see every time we have a</text>
  <text start="887.12" dur="7.74">bounce up we have a bigger bounce down</text>
  <text start="891.35" dur="5.7">and we can see with the chicago PMI this</text>
  <text start="894.86" dur="6.45">is what&amp;#39;s been happening since at the</text>
  <text start="897.05" dur="7.62">middle of 2014 or so and we can see that</text>
  <text start="901.31" dur="5.969">the central bank they do whatever they</text>
  <text start="904.67" dur="5.4">possibly can to keep this economy alive</text>
  <text start="907.279" dur="6">and keep people in the dark keep people</text>
  <text start="910.07" dur="4.62">in the illusion and we know that there</text>
  <text start="913.279" dur="3.411">are certain areas they can do this in</text>
  <text start="914.69" dur="4.38">certain other areas they just cannot</text>
  <text start="916.69" dur="5.29">because they just don&amp;#39;t have that type</text>
  <text start="919.07" dur="4.68">of control but the main thing they</text>
  <text start="921.98" dur="3.99">control is the stock market and a lot of</text>
  <text start="923.75" dur="4.2">people look to that and this is where</text>
  <text start="925.97" dur="3.54">they want people looking and we know</text>
  <text start="927.95" dur="3.45">that this is not an indicator of</text>
  <text start="929.51" dur="4.8">anything this is an indicator of</text>
  <text start="931.4" dur="8.99">manipulation we see the Baltic Dry Index</text>
  <text start="934.31" dur="11.18">has climbed to 429 up 15 still way way</text>
  <text start="940.39" dur="10.87">below where it&amp;#39;s been since like 1985</text>
  <text start="945.49" dur="8.44">this is horrific actually and most</text>
  <text start="951.26" dur="5.64">likely this is going to drop once again</text>
  <text start="953.93" dur="7.98">because we can see what happens people</text>
  <text start="956.9" dur="8.59">come in the stores the companies have</text>
  <text start="961.91" dur="5.5">their inventories they draw the</text>
  <text start="965.49" dur="4.289">down people still want certain things</text>
  <text start="967.41" dur="5.67">they have to order more we see a little</text>
  <text start="969.779" dur="6.18">bump up they order more and demand</text>
  <text start="973.08" dur="5.04">continually drops down the ordering</text>
  <text start="975.959" dur="6.811">becomes smaller and smaller and smaller</text>
  <text start="978.12" dur="6.99">and we end up crashing and this is what</text>
  <text start="982.77" dur="6.87">we&amp;#39;ve been seeing and believe me when it</text>
  <text start="985.11" dur="5.849">gets around 500 or 490 or 525 the</text>
  <text start="989.64" dur="4.59">corporate media most likely will say</text>
  <text start="990.959" dur="5.25">this is the new normal now if they</text>
  <text start="994.23" dur="4.859">mention it at all they might not because</text>
  <text start="996.209" dur="5.341">it&amp;#39;s so low still even at 5i even at 600</text>
  <text start="999.089" dur="4.851">it is really really low compared to what</text>
  <text start="1001.55" dur="8.01">it was when we were in a booming economy</text>
  <text start="1003.94" dur="9.13">now JPMorgan Chase they have shaved the</text>
  <text start="1009.56" dur="7.38">first half of this year their GDP</text>
  <text start="1013.07" dur="6.18">estimates by 0.5% because of weaker</text>
  <text start="1016.94" dur="4.709">durable goods it&amp;#39;s like washers dryers</text>
  <text start="1019.25" dur="4.47">those things and they&amp;#39;re also saying</text>
  <text start="1021.649" dur="4.981">that consumer spending is way way down</text>
  <text start="1023.72" dur="5.55">remember they include Obamacare in</text>
  <text start="1026.63" dur="3.99">consumer spending if we strip Obamacare</text>
  <text start="1029.27" dur="4.74">out and we know Obamacare the Affordable</text>
  <text start="1030.62" dur="4.949">Care Act has very high premiums and this</text>
  <text start="1034.01" dur="3.15">is why they like to include this in</text>
  <text start="1035.569" dur="3.061">consumer spending because it makes it</text>
  <text start="1037.16" dur="3.36">look really good like what people are</text>
  <text start="1038.63" dur="3.809">spending again well if you strip it away</text>
  <text start="1040.52" dur="6.21">actually people are not spending at all</text>
  <text start="1042.439" dur="6.211">and this is quite evident in malls with</text>
  <text start="1046.73" dur="5.67">the stores closing down with people</text>
  <text start="1048.65" dur="5.94">being laid off in retail and we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="1052.4" dur="4.94">thousands and thousands of stores closed</text>
  <text start="1054.59" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;re seeing a contraction in stores now</text>
  <text start="1057.34" dur="4.39">just because you see people in malls</text>
  <text start="1060.08" dur="4.95">using their credit cards doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="1061.73" dur="5.25">that everything is fine people will</text>
  <text start="1065.03" dur="4.86">continue even when they&amp;#39;re bankrupt bill</text>
  <text start="1066.98" dur="5.4">could just continually spend because a</text>
  <text start="1069.89" dur="4.919">lot of people don&amp;#39;t like their lives to</text>
  <text start="1072.38" dur="3.9">change at all they believe that</text>
  <text start="1074.809" dur="3.931">everything is going to get better so</text>
  <text start="1076.28" dur="4.29">i&amp;#39;ll just keep spending and everything</text>
  <text start="1078.74" dur="5.43">will be fine it doesn&amp;#39;t show you that</text>
  <text start="1080.57" dur="7.2">this is a strong economy if people paid</text>
  <text start="1084.17" dur="6.93">with their currency and not with credit</text>
  <text start="1087.77" dur="7.59">i would say ok if everyone&amp;#39;s paying with</text>
  <text start="1091.1" dur="6.27">currency from their savings and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1095.36" dur="3.97">able to make more and continue the</text>
  <text start="1097.37" dur="4.21">purchasing I would say ok</text>
  <text start="1099.33" dur="4.23">have a strong economy but if you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="1101.58" dur="3.72">buying things on credit than getting</text>
  <text start="1103.56" dur="2.82">another credit card and buying more than</text>
  <text start="1105.3" dur="5.63">getting another credit card and buying</text>
  <text start="1106.38" dur="7.26">more that&amp;#39;s not strength that&amp;#39;s dead</text>
  <text start="1110.93" dur="5.2">because eventually what happens is it</text>
  <text start="1113.64" dur="4.95">grows so big you can&amp;#39;t sustain it just</text>
  <text start="1116.13" dur="5.19">like the US government there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1118.59" dur="5.67">difference here and we see right now</text>
  <text start="1121.32" dur="6.27">that JPMorgan Chase their estimating</text>
  <text start="1124.26" dur="4.47">that GDP is going to be around 1.2</text>
  <text start="1127.59" dur="4.71">percent they thought it was going to be</text>
  <text start="1128.73" dur="5.43">at two percent and they&amp;#39;re saying the</text>
  <text start="1132.3" dur="6.62">second quarter that most likely will be</text>
  <text start="1134.16" dur="8.31">two percent now if you go back to 2015</text>
  <text start="1138.92" dur="8.41">they said 2016 was going to be the year</text>
  <text start="1142.47" dur="7.86">when the US economy takes off now if you</text>
  <text start="1147.33" dur="6.36">go back in time they said this in 2014 4</text>
  <text start="1150.33" dur="6.15">2015 they said this in 2015 4 2016 now</text>
  <text start="1153.69" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re saying it for 2016 for 2017 that</text>
  <text start="1156.48" dur="7.08">2017 is going to be the year that the</text>
  <text start="1159.36" dur="6.96">economy takes off if you notice the</text>
  <text start="1163.56" dur="4.37">central bank the IMF and all these</text>
  <text start="1166.32" dur="4.56">predictions they&amp;#39;re always wrong</text>
  <text start="1167.93" dur="6.55">actually every time they say it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1170.88" dur="6.66">to be better if you notice GDP has been</text>
  <text start="1174.48" dur="7.35">sliding and declining it&amp;#39;s doing the</text>
  <text start="1177.54" dur="6.14">opposite of what they&amp;#39;re saying and from</text>
  <text start="1181.83" dur="5.4">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="1183.68" dur="8.47">this is why everyone should take a look</text>
  <text start="1187.23" dur="7.65">at all this data and say hmm this is</text>
  <text start="1192.15" dur="8.19">what happened in 2008 now it&amp;#39;s much much</text>
  <text start="1194.88" dur="7.29">worse maybe I should prepare and this is</text>
  <text start="1200.34" dur="4.92">what we&amp;#39;ve been following the</text>
  <text start="1202.17" dur="5.43">deterioration of the economy and every</text>
  <text start="1205.26" dur="5.34">time we look at this it declines and</text>
