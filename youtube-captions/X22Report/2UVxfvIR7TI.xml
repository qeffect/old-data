  <text start="117.7" dur="6.72">is pushing the agenda not to have trade</text>
  <text start="121.84" dur="7.32">wars around the world but to set</text>
  <text start="124.42" dur="7.05">everything back to the way it was before</text>
  <text start="129.16" dur="5.389">the globalists before the central bank</text>
  <text start="131.47" dur="9.17">got their hands on the economic system</text>

  <text start="153.76" dur="6.72">we&amp;#39;re in today they&amp;#39;re in complete</text>
  <text start="156.94" dur="4.57">control of how the economic system works</text>
  <text start="160.48" dur="4.569">Trump</text>

  <text start="168.17" dur="8.61">he wanted to go but he knows that this</text>
  <text start="172.129" dur="8.64">is only temporary and he&amp;#39;s using tariffs</text>
  <text start="176.78" dur="7.679">as leverage against the central bank</text>
  <text start="180.769" dur="5.671">system we need to remember that the</text>
  <text start="184.459" dur="4.981">central bank system is at the heart of</text>
  <text start="186.44" dur="6.359">all this and this is why he&amp;#39;s placed</text>
  <text start="189.44" dur="6.24">tariffs on China he decided that he was</text>
  <text start="192.799" dur="7.321">going to place tariffs on Brazil and</text>

  <text start="209.72" dur="4.139">tariffs on these two countries the</text>
  <text start="211.129" dur="7.681">question is why did he decide to do it</text>
  <text start="213.859" dur="7.831">now well one reason is Brazil has been</text>
  <text start="218.81" dur="5.91">moving closer to China the Brazilian</text>
  <text start="221.69" dur="6.54">President signed eight trade agreements</text>
  <text start="224.72" dur="6">with Xi Jinping in October Trump is</text>
  <text start="228.23" dur="5.25">using this as leverage he tweeted out</text>
  <text start="230.72" dur="4.26">the following Brazil and Argentina have</text>
  <text start="233.48" dur="3.839">been presiding over a massive</text>
  <text start="234.98" dur="4.589">devaluation of their currencies which is</text>
  <text start="237.319" dur="3.45">not good for our farmers therefore</text>
  <text start="239.569" dur="3.42">effective immediately</text>
  <text start="240.769" dur="4.5">I&amp;#39;ll restore the tariffs on all steel</text>
  <text start="242.989" dur="4.261">and aluminum that is shipped into the</text>
  <text start="245.269" dur="4.53">u.s. from those countries the Federal</text>

  <text start="249.799" dur="4.08">countries of which there are many no</text>
  <text start="252.379" dur="3.42">longer take advantage of our strong</text>
  <text start="253.879" dur="4.26">dollar by further devaluing their</text>
  <text start="255.799" dur="4.861">currencies this makes it very hard for</text>

  <text start="272.63" dur="4.05">continually devaluing and why do you</text>
  <text start="274.849" dur="4.021">think these countries are devaluing you</text>
  <text start="276.68" dur="5.64">think it&amp;#39;s the central bank system that</text>
  <text start="278.87" dur="4.979">is devaluing the currency you think they</text>
  <text start="282.32" dur="5.52">are telling the government so this is</text>
  <text start="283.849" dur="7.651">what you need to do absolutely Trump is</text>
  <text start="287.84" dur="6">countering this plus he wants the Fed to</text>
  <text start="291.5" dur="3.33">bring down the rates here in this</text>

  <text start="308.84" dur="4.53">wants the Fed to keep up with this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="311.33" dur="5.37">almost the same thing as the Fed raising</text>
  <text start="313.37" dur="6.57">rates and removing the toxic assets from</text>
  <text start="316.7" dur="4.62">their balance sheet instead the central</text>

  <text start="448.889" dur="3.471">here in the United States after the</text>
  <text start="450.509" dur="4.171">mainstream media went along with this</text>
  <text start="452.36" dur="4.839">actually the opposite is going to happen</text>
  <text start="454.68" dur="3.299">actually during the presidential race in</text>

  <text start="575.6" dur="6.179">letting us know there is another way an</text>
  <text start="578.92" dur="6.759">economic growth would be off the charts</text>
  <text start="581.779" dur="9.72">and all we need to do is one simple</text>
  <text start="585.679" dur="8.671">thing remove the central bank system get</text>
  <text start="591.499" dur="4.95">rid of this globalist central bank</text>
  <text start="594.35" dur="5.88">system and we would see something</text>
  <text start="596.449" dur="7.26">completely different and this is where</text>
  <text start="600.23" dur="6.959">we&amp;#39;re headed this is why Trump is using</text>
  <text start="603.709" dur="5.61">tariffs this is why Trump is hitting the</text>
  <text start="607.189" dur="3.69">globalist reworking the trade deals</text>

  <text start="610.879" dur="6.21">independent</text>
  <text start="611.709" dur="10.031">it&amp;#39;s all part of the plan because you</text>
  <text start="617.089" dur="7.98">cannot have a central bank economic</text>
  <text start="621.74" dur="5.699">system and you just removed the swamp</text>
  <text start="625.069" dur="5.43">because if you still have the central</text>
  <text start="627.439" dur="6.301">banks in control the swamp is going to</text>
  <text start="630.499" dur="5.731">grow out of the central bank system</text>

  <text start="773.58" dur="7.2">bank system at its end-stage Trump is</text>
  <text start="777.27" dur="5.91">now building up a system that is going</text>

  <text start="789.48" dur="7.59">course it is but as Trump says it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="793.23" dur="7.08">going to be far greater than most have</text>
