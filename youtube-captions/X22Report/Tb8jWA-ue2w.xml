  <text start="210.84" dur="7.69">duterte who asked the US special forces</text>
  <text start="214.989" dur="6.181">to leave the island well the US has</text>
  <text start="218.53" dur="7.08">spoken up and they sang that they have</text>
  <text start="221.17" dur="7.2">not received official word or an</text>
  <text start="225.61" dur="5.4">official demand to pull out the special</text>
  <text start="228.37" dur="5.58">forces from the Philippines so we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="231.01" dur="6.09">watch this situation and we&amp;#39;ll see what</text>
  <text start="233.95" dur="5.67">happens if the president of the</text>
  <text start="237.1" dur="7.79">Philippines decides to make an official</text>
  <text start="239.62" dur="7.589">demand from the US now out in Libya the</text>
  <text start="244.89" dur="4.569">situation there is getting worse a</text>
  <text start="247.209" dur="5.701">couple reports ago we talked about how</text>
  <text start="249.459" dur="5.491">the forces inside of Libya this is not</text>
  <text start="252.91" dur="6.21">part of the unity government they were</text>
  <text start="254.95" dur="8.96">taken control of oil ports and they were</text>
  <text start="259.12" dur="7.71">controlling the shipment of oil and</text>
  <text start="263.91" dur="5.95">forces opposed to the Libya&amp;#39;s unity</text>
  <text start="266.83" dur="7.28">government they seized the fourth oil</text>
  <text start="269.86" dur="8.34">port completing their takeover of the</text>
  <text start="274.11" dur="7.36">installations in Libya so they have the</text>
  <text start="278.2" dur="5.64">entire oil Crescent region it is now</text>
  <text start="281.47" dur="4.68">under their control it is no longer</text>
  <text start="283.84" dur="5.52">under the control of the unity</text>
  <text start="286.15" dur="6.21">government they have control so what</text>
  <text start="289.36" dur="5.76">does this mean this means that the</text>
  <text start="292.36" dur="3">Western forces they&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="295.12" dur="4.109">bring</text>
  <text start="295.36" dur="5.489">in troops into this area because what</text>
  <text start="299.229" dur="4.801">we&amp;#39;re hearing already from the United</text>
  <text start="300.849" dur="7.981">States and five European powers they are</text>
  <text start="304.03" dur="11.099">telling the Libyan people to withdraw</text>
  <text start="308.83" dur="9.57">from the oil ports and this is what they</text>
  <text start="315.129" dur="5.581">said we call for all military forces</text>
  <text start="318.4" dur="4.31">that have moved into the oil crescent to</text>
  <text start="320.71" dur="4.769">withdraw immediately without</text>
  <text start="322.71" dur="4.329">preconditions coming from the United</text>
  <text start="325.479" dur="6.78">States France Germany Italy Spain and</text>
  <text start="327.039" dur="9.18">Britain so right now they are giving</text>
  <text start="332.259" dur="7.62">them a warning and if they do not abide</text>
  <text start="336.219" dur="7.2">by this warning most likely we will see</text>
  <text start="339.879" dur="8.331">troops come into this area and try to</text>
  <text start="343.419" dur="7.921">take back this entire oil Crescent</text>
  <text start="348.21" dur="7.299">region and the situation is getting</text>
  <text start="351.34" dur="6.75">worse because think about this in Libya</text>
  <text start="355.509" dur="5.46">they are completely losing control the</text>
  <text start="358.09" dur="5.43">people are taking back their country the</text>
  <text start="360.969" dur="6.54">same thing is happening in Yemen the</text>
  <text start="363.52" dur="5.579">Iraqi people they are fighting to remove</text>
  <text start="367.509" dur="3.15">the puppet government the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="369.099" dur="4.201">bringing in more and more troops they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="370.659" dur="4.141">using the illusion that they&amp;#39;re fighting</text>
  <text start="373.3" dur="2.579">the Islamic state but what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="374.8" dur="5.369">really doing is they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="375.879" dur="6.63">maintain control in Iraq and we have the</text>
  <text start="380.169" dur="5.52">same thing occurring in Lebanon Syria is</text>
  <text start="382.509" dur="6.06">a complete mess so as the Middle East</text>
  <text start="385.689" dur="5.991">completely falls apart what happens to</text>
  <text start="388.569" dur="8.34">the petro dollar the petro dollar is</text>
  <text start="391.68" dur="7.989">doomed and as we continually move</text>
  <text start="396.909" dur="4.861">forward day by day here the situation is</text>
  <text start="399.669" dur="3.92">getting worse and worse the United</text>
  <text start="401.77" dur="5.88">States has lost complete control in</text>
  <text start="403.589" dur="7.241">Syria and we can see already there are</text>
  <text start="407.65" dur="7.069">violations in Syria we see the moderate</text>
  <text start="410.83" dur="7.619">rebels they have been firing on the</text>
  <text start="414.719" dur="6.521">Syrian forces and there are about twenty</text>
  <text start="418.449" dur="5.671">three violations there and the situation</text>
  <text start="421.24" dur="6.409">is just getting worse and worse than you</text>
  <text start="424.12" dur="4.8">have to remember once the people</text>
  <text start="427.649" dur="3.521">completely</text>
  <text start="428.92" dur="7.55">over these countries and the u.s. can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="431.17" dur="7.76">do anything about it they will use other</text>
  <text start="436.47" dur="6.34">currencies maybe even gold and silver</text>
  <text start="438.93" dur="7">but most likely they will drop the</text>
  <text start="442.81" dur="5.88">dollar and when they do drop the dollar</text>
  <text start="445.93" dur="6.09">and what I mean by dropped the dollar</text>
  <text start="448.69" dur="5.46">where they&amp;#39;re not going to require</text>
  <text start="452.02" dur="6.63">countries to purchase the oil using the</text>
  <text start="454.15" dur="7.05">dollar all those dollars that are in the</text>
  <text start="458.65" dur="4.62">reserves of all these countries well</text>
  <text start="461.2" dur="4.17">they don&amp;#39;t need them there anymore the</text>
  <text start="463.27" dur="5.73">only reason they have them is to</text>
  <text start="465.37" dur="6.51">purchase the oil that will float back to</text>
  <text start="469" dur="6.66">the United States that will eventually</text>
  <text start="471.88" dur="5.52">cause inflation we might be seeing a</text>
  <text start="475.66" dur="4.95">little bit deflation here a little bit</text>
  <text start="477.4" dur="5.1">of inflation right now but as more and</text>
  <text start="480.61" dur="5.37">more of this country comes currency</text>
  <text start="482.5" dur="7.37">comes back into the country it D values</text>
  <text start="485.98" dur="8.49">the dollar and as the dollars devalued</text>
  <text start="489.87" dur="8.65">prices move up and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="494.47" dur="8.19">tough situation for a lot of people now</text>
  <text start="498.52" dur="8.19">out in the Golan height area we see a</text>
  <text start="502.66" dur="10.13">situation occurring now on the eve of</text>
  <text start="506.71" dur="9.81">the ceasefire in northern Syria Israel</text>
  <text start="512.79" dur="6.42">decided to fly their jets into the Golan</text>
  <text start="516.52" dur="7.709">Heights and attack Syrian artillery</text>
  <text start="519.21" dur="8.83">positions and Syria is saying that they</text>
  <text start="524.229" dur="7.621">downed warplane and a drone after the</text>
  <text start="528.04" dur="5.79">attack and there is a leaked video that</text>
  <text start="531.85" dur="4.71">has been released that shows the downing</text>
  <text start="533.83" dur="5.58">of the aircraft there&amp;#39;s a surface-to-air</text>
  <text start="536.56" dur="6.15">surface-to-air missile that hit the</text>
  <text start="539.41" dur="8.34">aircraft and brought it down and we can</text>
  <text start="542.71" dur="7.79">see right now that Israel was making a</text>
  <text start="547.75" dur="5.01">move in this area so because of this</text>
  <text start="550.5" dur="4.63">Syria decided that they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="552.76" dur="4.85">sending a large convoy of reinforcements</text>
  <text start="555.13" dur="5.49">from Damascus to the Golan Heights and</text>
  <text start="557.61" dur="5.32">they will be positioned in this area and</text>
  <text start="560.62" dur="5.1">we can see the situation</text>
  <text start="562.93" dur="6.39">is continually getting worse and worse</text>
  <text start="565.72" dur="5.97">because not for Russia and Syria but for</text>
  <text start="569.32" dur="5.85">the United States the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="571.69" dur="6.54">Israel because their entire plan was to</text>
  <text start="575.17" dur="6.9">get Syria to control Syria to build the</text>
  <text start="578.23" dur="7.74">pipeline to supply Europe with oil and</text>
  <text start="582.07" dur="6.959">gas to put the central bank in Syria on</text>
  <text start="585.97" dur="4.28">the dollar and all of this is completely</text>
  <text start="589.029" dur="5.191">falling apart and of course to</text>
  <text start="590.25" dur="7.81">eventually go into Iran and we can see</text>
  <text start="594.22" dur="6.39">right now that Russia they have spoke to</text>
  <text start="598.06" dur="4.32">Iran about this agreement that the</text>
  <text start="600.61" dur="4.62">United States and Russia decided on and</text>
  <text start="602.38" dur="6.5">Iran sees no problems with the agreement</text>
  <text start="605.23" dur="6.45">whatsoever Russia right now is deploying</text>
  <text start="608.88" dur="5.32">operative groups in Aleppo and Hama and</text>
  <text start="611.68" dur="5.219">we can see right now that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="614.2" dur="4.829">bringing in troops into this area to</text>
  <text start="616.899" dur="4.351">control the situation the Castello</text>
  <text start="619.029" dur="4.711">highway they&amp;#39;re going to be used for</text>
  <text start="621.25" dur="5.7">sending humanitarian aid to different</text>
  <text start="623.74" dur="6.51">areas and we can see right now the u.s.</text>
  <text start="626.95" dur="6.86">is really stuck in a corner at this</text>
  <text start="630.25" dur="6.9">point we know they wanted this ceasefire</text>
  <text start="633.81" dur="7.6">because they needed a period where they</text>
  <text start="637.15" dur="7.86">can bring in reinforcements but we see</text>
  <text start="641.41" dur="6.99">already that Kerry started to talk about</text>
  <text start="645.01" dur="6.78">the ceasefire agreement and he was</text>
  <text start="648.4" dur="4.92">making up things as he went along where</text>
  <text start="651.79" dur="5.22">he said Syria is not supposed to bomb</text>
  <text start="653.32" dur="5.73">anyone without the u.s. permission well</text>
  <text start="657.01" dur="4.62">do you really think that&amp;#39;s the agreement</text>
  <text start="659.05" dur="4.05">that Russia and Syria made with the US</text>
  <text start="661.63" dur="7.38">when Russia and Syria have the upper</text>
  <text start="663.1" dur="7.739">hand no every time they come up with a</text>
  <text start="669.01" dur="3.63">ceasefire agreement it seems like the</text>
  <text start="670.839" dur="5.041">United States comes out and they have a</text>
  <text start="672.64" dur="7.11">completely different story of what</text>
  <text start="675.88" dur="6.149">really happened in the talks so the</text>
  <text start="679.75" dur="5.52">State Department quickly came out and</text>
  <text start="682.029" dur="4.741">reserve reversed itself and this is</text>
  <text start="685.27" dur="3.39">coming from spokesman John Kirby saying</text>
  <text start="686.77" dur="3.78">later that there was no provisions under</text>
  <text start="688.66" dur="3.75">the nationwide truce for us Russia</text>
  <text start="690.55" dur="5.87">authorization of bombing missions by</text>
  <text start="692.41" dur="7.81">Assad&amp;#39;s forces of course not</text>
  <text start="696.42" dur="6.419">Assad and his forces the Russian forces</text>
  <text start="700.22" dur="4.809">they are allowed to go after the</text>
  <text start="702.839" dur="4.531">terrorist the only forces they cannot go</text>
  <text start="705.029" dur="4.771">after are the moderate rebels under the</text>
  <text start="707.37" dur="5.219">ceasefire agreement and of course we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="709.8" dur="4.529">always had that problem of who are the</text>
  <text start="712.589" dur="4.171">moderate who are the terrorists because</text>
  <text start="714.329" dur="3.81">the u.s. likes to intertwine the two</text>
  <text start="716.76" dur="4.019">groups together actually they&amp;#39;re one in</text>
  <text start="718.139" dur="4.26">the same but they pretend that oh we</text>
  <text start="720.779" dur="3.391">have moderates and terrorists all</text>
  <text start="722.399" dur="5.31">intertwined and this is why you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="724.17" dur="5.88">bomb them they did this on purpose but</text>
  <text start="727.709" dur="5.13">now we can see that al-qaeda al-nusrah</text>
  <text start="730.05" dur="7.649">the rebranded al-qaeda they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="732.839" dur="11.791">terrorist groups and Russia is very</text>
  <text start="737.699" dur="9.721">concerned right now because the moderate</text>
  <text start="744.63" dur="5.759">rebels the largest group they have</text>
  <text start="747.42" dur="4.89">refused to obey by the Russian us</text>
  <text start="750.389" dur="5.31">agreement they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="752.31" dur="6.51">going along with it and from this this</text>
  <text start="755.699" dur="5.76">whole ceasefire agreement might just</text>
  <text start="758.82" dur="4.5">completely fall apart Lavrov is also</text>
  <text start="761.459" dur="6.421">saying that he has no reason to trust</text>
  <text start="763.32" dur="7.56">the United States but because we see on</text>
  <text start="767.88" dur="6.51">the ground in Syria that the coalition</text>
  <text start="770.88" dur="6.69">forces they&amp;#39;re really not bombing al</text>
  <text start="774.39" dur="5.939">Qaeda or al-nusrah or the rebranded</text>

  <text start="795.6" dur="5.66">can see part of the ceasefire agreement</text>
  <text start="797.87" dur="8.079">it is kept in seeks secrecy because</text>
  <text start="801.26" dur="8.98">there&amp;#39;s sensitive information that the</text>

  <text start="837.21" dur="5.76">don&amp;#39;t want out there and we can see</text>
  <text start="840.27" dur="5.15">right now throughout the Middle East the</text>
  <text start="842.97" dur="8.37">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="845.42" dur="9.4">they&amp;#39;re losing control rapidly I mean</text>
  <text start="851.34" dur="7.56">it&amp;#39;s so obvious right now that they</text>
  <text start="854.82" dur="6.87">don&amp;#39;t have the upper hand and since they</text>
  <text start="858.9" dur="6.06">don&amp;#39;t have the upper hand this is an</text>
  <text start="861.69" dur="7.74">indicator letting us know that the clock</text>
  <text start="864.96" dur="6.21">is ticking down because once everything</text>
  <text start="869.43" dur="5.24">starts to fall apart in these different</text>
  <text start="871.17" dur="9">areas like Libya for instance like Yemen</text>
  <text start="874.67" dur="8.41">Iraq Syria the petro dollar will cease</text>
  <text start="880.17" dur="8.24">to exist if the petrodollar ceases to</text>
  <text start="883.08" dur="7.26">exist we have a major problem and all</text>
  <text start="888.41" dur="3.43">fingers are going to point back to the</text>
  <text start="890.34" dur="4.77">central bank because this is their</text>
  <text start="891.84" dur="6.81">system that they created so if the</text>
  <text start="895.11" dur="6.479">system dies this way and collapses in</text>
  <text start="898.65" dur="5.13">this way the central banks are going to</text>
  <text start="901.589" dur="7.491">be blamed they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen</text>
  <text start="903.78" dur="7.83">and this leads us to what might happen</text>
  <text start="909.08" dur="5.2">coming up very soon now it could happen</text>
  <text start="911.61" dur="6.51">this fall it could happen in 2017 we</text>
  <text start="914.28" dur="5.4">don&amp;#39;t know yet but we can see we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="918.12" dur="5.19">heading in that direction and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="919.68" dur="7.11">approaching very very quickly and we can</text>
  <text start="923.31" dur="7.55">see the perfect storm well the winds are</text>
  <text start="926.79" dur="8.52">picking up the storm is intensifying and</text>
  <text start="930.86" dur="7.54">it is getting worse and we can see just</text>
  <text start="935.31" dur="5.19">with Hillary where one minute the</text>
  <text start="938.4" dur="5.22">corporate media is telling us that she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="940.5" dur="5.61">in perfect health the next minute we see</text>
  <text start="943.62" dur="4.83">her passing out during the 911</text>
  <text start="946.11" dur="4.05">ceremonies where she was propped up on a</text>
  <text start="948.45" dur="4.68">stone pillar as soon as they went to</text>
  <text start="950.16" dur="7.26">move her she collapsed now remember the</text>
  <text start="953.13" dur="7.709">central bank&amp;#39;s the corporation&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="957.42" dur="5.909">elite the neocons they want control the</text>
  <text start="960.839" dur="4.47">situation now I I&amp;#39;m not for any can</text>
  <text start="963.329" dur="3.841">I don&amp;#39;t care about Hillary I don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="965.309" dur="3.93">about Trump because the shadow</text>
  <text start="967.17" dur="3.87">government is always in control the</text>
  <text start="969.239" dur="5.07">central bankers they&amp;#39;re always in</text>
  <text start="971.04" dur="4.699">control until we remove them it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="974.309" dur="5.46">really matter what candidates in there</text>
  <text start="975.739" dur="7.45">because if they don&amp;#39;t abide by what they</text>
  <text start="979.769" dur="6.93">want they will be removed one way or</text>
  <text start="983.189" dur="5.971">another but this poses a huge problem</text>
  <text start="986.699" dur="8.521">because of Hillary from what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="989.16" dur="9.049">saying is truly in bad health what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="995.22" dur="7.799">their other candidate Bernie Sanders and</text>
  <text start="998.209" dur="8.47">we can see right now that the situation</text>
  <text start="1003.019" dur="6.47">is getting worse now for them to go</text>
  <text start="1006.679" dur="5.041">ahead and maybe assassinate Trump I</text>
  <text start="1009.489" dur="5.95">don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;ll go down that route</text>
  <text start="1011.72" dur="6.51">too obvious everyone will be pointing</text>
  <text start="1015.439" dur="5.36">the finger at the government everyone be</text>
  <text start="1018.23" dur="6.24">pointing saying see this is what happens</text>
  <text start="1020.799" dur="6.64">you don&amp;#39;t want to have the person in</text>
  <text start="1024.47" dur="6.179">office that you didn&amp;#39;t pick so I think</text>
  <text start="1027.439" dur="6.39">this would be just too obvious we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1030.649" dur="5.04">seeing around the different private</text>
  <text start="1033.829" dur="3.181">lessons in domain countries like in</text>
  <text start="1035.689" dur="3.931">France for instance they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="1037.01" dur="5.519">about postponement because of state of</text>
  <text start="1039.62" dur="5.969">emergency because of terrorism and I can</text>
  <text start="1042.529" dur="5.67">see that happening here where they use</text>
  <text start="1045.589" dur="6.361">this scenario or maybe some other</text>
  <text start="1048.199" dur="6.48">scenario to postpone these elections to</text>
  <text start="1051.95" dur="5.099">put them off temporarily of course maybe</text>
  <text start="1054.679" dur="6.541">instead of November will have the</text>
  <text start="1057.049" dur="7.891">elections in April of 2017 and of course</text>
  <text start="1061.22" dur="6.75">every time they say it&amp;#39;s temporary we</text>
  <text start="1064.94" dur="7.02">know what happens now they can use this</text>
  <text start="1067.97" dur="7.89">temporary to postponed because of maybe</text>
  <text start="1071.96" dur="6.12">this of a natural national emergency for</text>
  <text start="1075.86" dur="5.52">a couple of months and then they can</text>
  <text start="1078.08" dur="6.839">have another event occur where they can</text>
  <text start="1081.38" dur="6.149">say well it was temporary until this</text>
  <text start="1084.919" dur="6.301">happened so they could have a minor</text>
  <text start="1087.529" dur="8.461">event to postpone them temporarily and</text>
  <text start="1091.22" dur="11.55">then have a major event to keep</text>
  <text start="1095.99" dur="9.45">maybe obama in office permanently going</text>
  <text start="1102.77" dur="5.58">forward and this is a real possibility</text>
  <text start="1105.44" dur="6.72">at this point because anything is</text>
  <text start="1108.35" dur="6.15">possible remember the central bank&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1112.16" dur="4.71">corporation&amp;#39;s the elite the neocons they</text>
  <text start="1114.5" dur="6.96">do not want to give up their control</text>
  <text start="1116.87" dur="8.64">they love control they want the party to</text>
  <text start="1121.46" dur="6.57">continue they like having the power they</text>
  <text start="1125.51" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t want to give this up and believe</text>
  <text start="1128.03" dur="5.94">me they&amp;#39;re not going to give it up that</text>
  <text start="1129.65" dur="9.029">easily this is why they already have in</text>
  <text start="1133.97" dur="7.65">the works plans to do whatever they have</text>
  <text start="1138.679" dur="4.431">to do and we can see we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1141.62" dur="3.809">closer and closer to that situation</text>
  <text start="1143.11" dur="6.25">where they might be implementing their</text>
  <text start="1145.429" dur="5.941">plans and this is something that we need</text>
  <text start="1149.36" dur="4.14">to watch we need to understand what is</text>
  <text start="1151.37" dur="4.89">going on we need to call them out on it</text>
  <text start="1153.5" dur="4.74">and if we all band together with</text>
  <text start="1156.26" dur="5.37">information with pointing the finger</text>
  <text start="1158.24" dur="7.47">with video we can show the world that</text>
  <text start="1161.63" dur="7.41">this is what they&amp;#39;re doing because this</text>
  <text start="1165.71" dur="6.21">is how this war is being fought it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1169.04" dur="5.19">being fought with video with people</text>

  <text start="1174.23" dur="8.28">corporate media we&amp;#39;re waging a war on</text>
  <text start="1179.32" dur="6.16">social media and more and more people</text>
  <text start="1182.51" dur="5.669">are coming out and talking about what is</text>
  <text start="1185.48" dur="6.54">going on how the government lies how</text>
  <text start="1188.179" dur="6.661">they cover up how they manipulate and we</text>
  <text start="1192.02" dur="6.24">need to stick together and continue this</text>
