  <text start="92.47" dur="4.079">administration those people behind him</text>
  <text start="94.18" dur="5.729">they&amp;#39;re hitting the central bank the</text>
  <text start="96.549" dur="8.49">deep state from all angles and this is</text>
  <text start="99.909" dur="10.081">about draining the entire swamp that</text>
  <text start="105.039" dur="8.031">includes the economic swamp and what is</text>
  <text start="109.99" dur="6.93">the economic swamp it&amp;#39;s Wall Street</text>
  <text start="113.07" dur="6.759">it&amp;#39;s those making a huge amount of money</text>
  <text start="116.92" dur="5.489">off of the central bank system the way</text>
  <text start="119.829" dur="6.481">it&amp;#39;s set up where the government can</text>
  <text start="122.409" dur="6.591">borrow and borrow and borrow and these</text>
  <text start="126.31" dur="8.04">corrupt politicians can take those funds</text>
  <text start="129" dur="9.28">create programs send that those funds to</text>
  <text start="134.35" dur="7.59">other places recycle them and have them</text>
  <text start="138.28" dur="7.75">come back to them this is how the</text>
  <text start="141.94" dur="6.58">central bank breeds corruption</text>
  <text start="146.03" dur="5.58">and Trump of the Patriots what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="148.52" dur="6.17">doing is they&amp;#39;re draining the economic</text>
  <text start="151.61" dur="5.82">swamp in order to drain all of this</text>
  <text start="154.69" dur="5.29">we&amp;#39;ve said this many times before you</text>
  <text start="157.43" dur="3.74">need to go to the source the source is</text>
  <text start="159.98" dur="4.08">the central bank</text>
  <text start="161.17" dur="5.83">there&amp;#39;s no checks and balances they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="164.06" dur="4.38">not audited nobody knows exactly what</text>
  <text start="167" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re a private entity</text>
  <text start="168.44" dur="8.04">and a private entity will make deals</text>
  <text start="173.15" dur="6.42">with certain individuals and you can see</text>
  <text start="176.48" dur="6.05">how corruption just spreads throughout</text>
  <text start="179.57" dur="5.73">the system and how funds are just lost</text>
  <text start="182.53" dur="6.39">into the ether where no one knows where</text>
  <text start="185.3" dur="7.95">it went and nobody wants to check either</text>
  <text start="188.92" dur="5.89">it&amp;#39;s time to reverse all this and this</text>
  <text start="193.25" dur="3.66">is what Trump and the Patriots are doing</text>
  <text start="194.81" dur="5.25">and it&amp;#39;s not an easy task</text>
  <text start="196.91" dur="5.34">because the central bank just doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="200.06" dur="5.259">want to give up control the deep state</text>
  <text start="202.25" dur="6.969">just doesn&amp;#39;t want to give up control</text>
  <text start="205.319" dur="7.771">we need to break this entire economic</text>
  <text start="209.219" dur="6.901">system we need to expose this economic</text>
  <text start="213.09" dur="5.489">system and we need to prepare for the</text>
  <text start="216.12" dur="5.31">transition and this is what Trump and</text>
  <text start="218.579" dur="5.401">the Patriots are doing right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="221.43" dur="6.63">doing this through trade talks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="223.98" dur="5.789">doing this with renegotiating trade</text>
  <text start="228.06" dur="5.67">deals that have been made by the</text>
  <text start="229.769" dur="6.961">globalists now with China we know that</text>
  <text start="233.73" dur="6.36">Trump he placed tariffs on China and</text>
  <text start="236.73" dur="5.879">other countries because he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="240.09" dur="5.28">even the playing field out remember once</text>
  <text start="242.609" dur="5.25">the dollar and I&amp;#39;m talking about the</text>
  <text start="245.37" dur="4.88">Federal Reserve know once that is no</text>
  <text start="247.859" dur="5.94">longer the reserve currency of the world</text>
  <text start="250.25" dur="6.849">countries no longer need to hold our</text>
  <text start="253.799" dur="6.06">current currency and use it to buy our</text>
  <text start="257.099" dur="5.07">goods that&amp;#39;s how this system was set up</text>
  <text start="259.859" dur="5.851">remember we&amp;#39;re in a central bank system</text>
  <text start="262.169" dur="6.78">this is a system that they set up this</text>
  <text start="265.71" dur="6.03">is not the founding father system this</text>
  <text start="268.949" dur="6.541">is a central a private western central</text>
  <text start="271.74" dur="5.64">bank system that they concocted to make</text>
  <text start="275.49" dur="4.679">themselves very wealthy to make</text>
  <text start="277.38" dur="6.93">themselves in control to enslave the</text>
  <text start="280.169" dur="6.361">people and to control basically the</text>
  <text start="284.31" dur="3.57">world because once you place a central</text>
  <text start="286.53" dur="4.74">bank in all the different countries you</text>
  <text start="287.88" dur="7.08">have full control then you put layers on</text>
  <text start="291.27" dur="7.53">top of that the IMF the Biz all the way</text>
  <text start="294.96" dur="6.679">up to the Ross trial and you need to</text>
  <text start="298.8" dur="5.19">remove all this it&amp;#39;s not an easy task</text>
  <text start="301.639" dur="5.141">you need to remove the corruption you</text>
  <text start="303.99" dur="6.63">need to remove a lot but the way to do</text>
  <text start="306.78" dur="7.08">this is to methodically slowly tear each</text>
  <text start="310.62" dur="4.74">part of their system down and this is</text>
  <text start="313.86" dur="5.25">exactly what Trump and the Patriots have</text>
  <text start="315.36" dur="6.72">been doing now Trump has been out in in</text>
  <text start="319.11" dur="4.35">London at a NATO summit and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="322.08" dur="3.48">speaking with many many different</text>
  <text start="323.46" dur="4.26">leaders one of the leaders is Boris</text>
  <text start="325.56" dur="4.62">Johnson who we met on the sidelines and</text>
  <text start="327.72" dur="5.96">they spoke about all different things</text>
  <text start="330.18" dur="6.54">and one of them had to do with trade</text>
  <text start="333.68" dur="5.14">very interesting because we know</text>
  <text start="336.72" dur="5.88">Trump put out the proposal that we could</text>
  <text start="338.82" dur="7.92">have a interim trade deal once the UK</text>
  <text start="342.6" dur="9.03">leaves the EU and I believe they were</text>
  <text start="346.74" dur="8.16">firming this up because he knows that</text>
  <text start="351.63" dur="5.34">eventually the UK is going to leave the</text>
  <text start="354.9" dur="5.4">EU now is it going to be with port</text>
  <text start="356.97" dur="5.43">Johnson most likely but if it isn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="360.3" dur="3.81">going to be somebody else we already</text>
  <text start="362.4" dur="5.1">know that Boris Johnson is leading in</text>
  <text start="364.11" dur="5.25">the election polls even though the</text>
  <text start="367.5" dur="3.9">mainstream media and all the rest are</text>
  <text start="369.36" dur="5.37">saying over there neck-and-neck they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="371.4" dur="6.39">very close people really don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="374.73" dur="5.73">leave the EU well actually it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="377.79" dur="5.34">opposite they&amp;#39;ve done this before they</text>
  <text start="380.46" dur="5">tried this before and they&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="383.13" dur="4.5">failed Trump tweeted out the following</text>
  <text start="385.46" dur="4.78">enjoyed my meeting with Prime Minister</text>
  <text start="387.63" dur="4.98">Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom at</text>
  <text start="390.24" dur="4.53">10 Downing Street last night talked</text>
  <text start="392.61" dur="6.24">about numerous subjects including NATO</text>
  <text start="394.77" dur="6.03">and trade and I believe this was an</text>
  <text start="398.85" dur="5.34">opportunity for Trump to meet Boris</text>
  <text start="400.8" dur="5.76">Johnson face to face and talk about one</text>
  <text start="404.19" dur="5.46">of the most important issues which is</text>
  <text start="406.56" dur="6.53">trade because remember once the UK</text>
  <text start="409.65" dur="9.46">leaves the EU they&amp;#39;re going to need</text>
  <text start="413.09" dur="7.609">trading partners and the EU well</text>
  <text start="419.11" dur="3.839">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to get in on the</text>
  <text start="420.699" dur="3.991">action but they&amp;#39;re gonna be pushed out</text>
  <text start="422.949" dur="4.62">of it because of the deal that Boris</text>
  <text start="424.69" dur="5.64">Johnson is making now with the other</text>
  <text start="427.569" dur="6.301">trade deals that Trump is negotiating</text>
  <text start="430.33" dur="7.14">like China we understand that this is</text>
  <text start="433.87" dur="6.479">really not about each country it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="437.47" dur="7.259">the way the globalist central bank</text>
  <text start="440.349" dur="7.051">system set up trade they made it very</text>
  <text start="444.729" dur="4.731">lopsided because they were trying to</text>
  <text start="447.4" dur="6.299">move everything out of this country</text>
  <text start="449.46" dur="7.06">Trump is not going to war and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="453.699" dur="8.131">mean a physical war with any of these</text>
  <text start="456.52" dur="8.16">countries he&amp;#39;s pushing a trade war on</text>
  <text start="461.83" dur="6.48">these countries to attack the central</text>
  <text start="464.68" dur="7.289">bank system as a whole the globalists</text>
  <text start="468.31" dur="5.789">system as a whole this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="471.969" dur="5.581">really worried about this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="474.099" dur="7.261">saying that if Trump doesn&amp;#39;t make a deal</text>
  <text start="477.55" dur="4.709">with China the whole thing&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="481.36" dur="4.08">fall apart and what they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="482.259" dur="6.09">talking about is that their system will</text>
  <text start="485.44" dur="4.89">fall apart because it&amp;#39;s based on China</text>
  <text start="488.349" dur="4.951">receiving the funds from the United</text>
  <text start="490.33" dur="7.92">States and China then selling their</text>
  <text start="493.3" dur="7.99">goods to Europe and China purchasing</text>
  <text start="498.25" dur="6.52">goods from Europe</text>
  <text start="501.29" dur="5.27">and if this doesn&amp;#39;t happen they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="504.77" dur="4.74">going to get those funds from China</text>
  <text start="506.56" dur="5.05">which really came from the US which is</text>
  <text start="509.51" dur="4.71">then spread out in Europe when they</text>
  <text start="511.61" dur="4.71">purchase their goods now we know that</text>
  <text start="514.22" dur="4.74">Trump is saying that he&amp;#39;s not in a rush</text>
  <text start="516.32" dur="4.95">for a trade deal he wants phase one that</text>
  <text start="518.96" dur="4.86">will help the farmers I think eventually</text>
  <text start="521.27" dur="5.49">there will be a trade deal but not the</text>
  <text start="523.82" dur="5.22">way everybody thinks I think he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="526.76" dur="4.47">holding out I think he wants to use this</text>
  <text start="529.04" dur="4.14">as leverage against the central bank and</text>
  <text start="531.23" dur="7.02">that&amp;#39;s exactly what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="533.18" dur="7.71">why because he needs time to prepare for</text>
  <text start="538.25" dur="4.68">the transition now the Trump</text>
  <text start="540.89" dur="3.84">administration they&amp;#39;re expecting to</text>
  <text start="542.93" dur="5.79">announce new measures that would end</text>
  <text start="544.73" dur="6.69">food stamp benefits for nearly 750,000</text>
  <text start="548.72" dur="4.53">low-income folks the new rules will make</text>
  <text start="551.42" dur="4.92">it difficult for states to gain waivers</text>
  <text start="553.25" dur="5.82">from a requirement that beneficiaries</text>
  <text start="556.34" dur="5.6">work or participate in a vocational</text>
  <text start="559.07" dur="6.21">training program why is Trump doing this</text>
  <text start="561.94" dur="6">the redistribution of wealth for poor</text>
  <text start="565.28" dur="6.21">people keeps them in a state of</text>
  <text start="567.94" dur="6.31">perpetual poverty the new requirements</text>
  <text start="571.49" dur="5.73">would only target able-bodied recipients</text>
  <text start="574.25" dur="6.39">who aren&amp;#39;t caring for children under six</text>
  <text start="577.22" dur="6.69">and why does the deep state why does the</text>
  <text start="580.64" dur="6.45">Central Bank like people dependent on</text>
  <text start="583.91" dur="5.22">the government because it keeps control</text>
  <text start="587.09" dur="5.52">over them</text>
  <text start="589.13" dur="4.92">Trump is going to remove this he also</text>
  <text start="592.61" dur="3.42">has to do this because he needs to cut</text>
  <text start="594.05" dur="4.04">expenses in the government I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="596.03" dur="5.79">going to be a lot more people than</text>
  <text start="598.09" dur="6.19">750,000 and remember a lot of these</text>
  <text start="601.82" dur="5.49">individuals they&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="604.28" dur="5.43">individuals who need this there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="607.31" dur="6.08">of wealthy people that are using this</text>
  <text start="609.71" dur="8.28">system to their benefit and those people</text>
  <text start="613.39" dur="7.09">who are on this system will have the</text>
  <text start="617.99" dur="4.56">opportunity to get jobs actually if you</text>
  <text start="620.48" dur="4.5">look at what Trump has been doing and</text>
  <text start="622.55" dur="6">this is on purpose the jobs that are</text>
  <text start="624.98" dur="7.95">being created are in the low to middle</text>
  <text start="628.55" dur="7.88">income range why because as he removes</text>
  <text start="632.93" dur="8.4">individuals from the food stamp program</text>
  <text start="636.43" dur="7.3">individuals are now getting jobs where</text>
  <text start="641.33" dur="4.71">they never had these jobs before or</text>
  <text start="643.73" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re able to get a job that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="646.04" dur="5.73">little bit better he&amp;#39;s doing this on</text>
  <text start="648.59" dur="5.64">purpose because this is preparing the</text>
  <text start="651.77" dur="5.07">country for the transition that is</text>
  <text start="654.23" dur="6.03">coming up this is why you see Trump out</text>
  <text start="656.84" dur="6.65">there changing everything the globalists</text>
  <text start="660.26" dur="7.26">the central banks have done and once</text>
  <text start="663.49" dur="6.76">he&amp;#39;s very very close to making all these</text>
  <text start="667.52" dur="5.73">deals and making what he wants to happen</text>
  <text start="670.25" dur="7.29">here happen you&amp;#39;re going to see the</text>
  <text start="673.25" dur="8.52">transition move forward just like back</text>
  <text start="677.54" dur="6.57">in the 70s they prepared the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="681.77" dur="5.37">system Kissinger was out in the Middle</text>
  <text start="684.11" dur="4.83">East making preparations the US forces</text>
  <text start="687.14" dur="4.8">would protect the Middle Eastern</text>
  <text start="688.94" dur="5.76">countries protect the oil as long as</text>
  <text start="691.94" dur="6.36">they sold the oil using the US dollar</text>
  <text start="694.7" dur="7.17">when all of that was complete they threw</text>
  <text start="698.3" dur="5.55">the switch 1971 this is when everything</text>
  <text start="701.87" dur="3.21">changed this is when they started to</text>
  <text start="703.85" dur="5.58">push</text>
  <text start="705.08" dur="6.56">the idea that we should be removed from</text>
  <text start="709.43" dur="5.52">the gold standard how did they do this</text>
  <text start="711.64" dur="6.34">well during the war they started to</text>
  <text start="714.95" dur="5.43">print a lot they didn&amp;#39;t want to return</text>
  <text start="717.98" dur="6.75">the gold to countries that were asking</text>
  <text start="720.38" dur="7.44">for their gold back this was all part of</text>
  <text start="724.73" dur="4.92">their plan to transition us from the</text>
  <text start="727.82" dur="3.78">gold back system to the petrodollar</text>
  <text start="729.65" dur="4.74">system now we&amp;#39;re gonna be doing this in</text>
