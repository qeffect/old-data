  <text start="27.529" dur="4.901">hi and welcome to the x 22 report my</text>
  <text start="30.27" dur="5.13">name is dave and this is episode 204 and</text>
  <text start="32.43" dur="5.49">today&amp;#39;s date is a november first 2013</text>
  <text start="35.4" dur="4.32">and the title this episode is disarming</text>
  <text start="37.92" dur="4.11">the American people want event at a time</text>
  <text start="39.72" dur="6.21">and what we saw today was yet again</text>
  <text start="42.03" dur="6.69">another major event and we saw a</text>
  <text start="45.93" dur="5.309">shooting in the LA Airport it was a lone</text>
  <text start="48.72" dur="5.369">gunman a lone wolf which they called him</text>
  <text start="51.239" dur="5.85">he was dressed in camouflage he came in</text>
  <text start="54.089" dur="6.57">with guess what the assault rifle that</text>
  <text start="57.089" dur="6.061">is right and shot up a couple of people</text>
  <text start="60.659" dur="9.061">people were hurt I believe he killed a</text>
  <text start="63.15" dur="11.329">TSA officer and this entire event was</text>
  <text start="69.72" dur="8.78">taken place in Dianne Feinstein&amp;#39;s state</text>
  <text start="74.479" dur="7.75">where they have very strict gun laws and</text>
  <text start="78.5" dur="6.549">this is because we have these gun bills</text>
  <text start="82.229" dur="4.95">and new gun bills being introduced but</text>
  <text start="85.049" dur="4.71">we have the two major ones the UN arms</text>
  <text start="87.179" dur="5.101">treaty and we have the Dianne Feinstein</text>
  <text start="89.759" dur="4.35">gun bill that are pending in the Senate</text>
  <text start="92.28" dur="5.159">and I&amp;#39;ve been saying this for a very</text>
  <text start="94.109" dur="6.72">long time we are building up to the main</text>
  <text start="97.439" dur="4.951">event now is this the main event I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="100.829" dur="3.511">know at this point but it looks like</text>
  <text start="102.39" dur="4.439">they are going to use this for three</text>
  <text start="104.34" dur="5.069">different areas that they want to push</text>
  <text start="106.829" dur="4.051">number one it&amp;#39;s an assault rifle in the</text>
  <text start="109.409" dur="3.5">state of California which is Dianne</text>
  <text start="110.88" dur="4.83">Feinstein which wrote the gun bill</text>
  <text start="112.909" dur="4.53">number two they&amp;#39;re demonizing gun owners</text>
  <text start="115.71" dur="5.1">they have a person there in camouflage</text>
  <text start="117.439" dur="6.371">coming in he&amp;#39;s lone wolf you know crazy</text>
  <text start="120.81" dur="5.07">gun owner running around could be it</text>
  <text start="123.81" dur="3.659">could be determined it could they could</text>
  <text start="125.88" dur="4.049">determine that he is a domestic</text>
  <text start="127.469" dur="5.241">terrorist and this is what the picture</text>
  <text start="129.929" dur="7.17">they&amp;#39;re trying to paint number three an</text>
  <text start="132.71" dur="7.93">unarmed TSA officer was shot and killed</text>
  <text start="137.099" dur="7.47">and DHS</text>
  <text start="140.64" dur="7.05">has been wanting to arm the TSA and this</text>
  <text start="144.569" dur="8.521">would push that agenda forward we&amp;#39;re now</text>
  <text start="147.69" dur="10.13">you will see fully armed tsa agents that</text>
  <text start="153.09" dur="8.64">look like military at the airports at</text>
  <text start="157.82" dur="5.83">the train stations at the malls and you</text>
  <text start="161.73" dur="4.53">can see how they&amp;#39;re pushing this agenda</text>
  <text start="163.65" dur="4.83">forward and we are going to see</text>
  <text start="166.26" dur="4.38">President Obama out there we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="168.48" dur="3.81">see a lot of politicians out there we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="170.64" dur="6.84">going to see Diane Feinstein out there</text>
  <text start="172.29" dur="8.28">all using this to push the pending gun</text>
  <text start="177.48" dur="4.86">bills the UN arms treaty and the Dianne</text>
  <text start="180.57" dur="4.919">Feinstein gun bill that are pending in</text>
  <text start="182.34" dur="5.399">the Senate and we know that John Kerry</text>
  <text start="185.489" dur="4.861">has already signed the UN arms treaty</text>
  <text start="187.739" dur="5.821">but the Senate hasn&amp;#39;t ratified it yet</text>
  <text start="190.35" dur="5.88">and the other gun bill that is in there</text>
  <text start="193.56" dur="5.1">they tried to pass back in April during</text>
  <text start="196.23" dur="4.62">the Boston bombing and that was shot</text>
  <text start="198.66" dur="5.64">down and the president asked for them to</text>
  <text start="200.85" dur="7.04">keep it there until some other time or</text>
  <text start="204.3" dur="6.09">event comes up so they left it pending</text>
  <text start="207.89" dur="5.65">you have to remember that the president</text>
  <text start="210.39" dur="5.069">has already signed and created executive</text>
  <text start="213.54" dur="3.509">orders that support all of this they</text>
  <text start="215.459" dur="4.291">support the UN arms treaty and</text>
  <text start="217.049" dur="5.431">everything and yesterday I reported on</text>
  <text start="219.75" dur="5.37">the three phases of disarmament of the</text>
  <text start="222.48" dur="7.229">American people and you can see why they</text>
  <text start="225.12" dur="6.929">need to get this UN arms treaty ratified</text>
  <text start="229.709" dur="5.361">by the Senate and they were going to use</text>
  <text start="232.049" dur="6">all of these incidents and especially</text>
  <text start="235.07" dur="5.169">the last one and I don&amp;#39;t believe this is</text>
  <text start="238.049" dur="6.69">the last one but there what there will</text>
  <text start="240.239" dur="7.5">be one that is very very bad and it will</text>
  <text start="244.739" dur="4.831">be horrific almost like the Sandy Hook</text>
  <text start="247.739" dur="4.111">one because that is the one that will</text>
  <text start="249.57" dur="5.04">move people these are the other ones</text>
  <text start="251.85" dur="4.949">that are leading up to it and and making</text>
  <text start="254.61" dur="4.349">everyone aware of what is going on and</text>
  <text start="256.799" dur="4.56">you can see it this is not by</text>
  <text start="258.959" dur="5.221">coincidence this is completely planned</text>
  <text start="261.359" dur="5.281">because it meets their agenda and they</text>
  <text start="264.18" dur="6.26">are moving this full force forward</text>
  <text start="266.64" dur="6.69">because according to the disarmament</text>
  <text start="270.44" dur="3.88">documentation we are at the tail end of</text>
  <text start="273.33" dur="3.72">phase two</text>
  <text start="274.32" dur="5.61">and this is what they are doing at this</text>
  <text start="277.05" dur="5.58">point let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="279.93" dur="6">collapse news and we are going out to</text>
  <text start="282.63" dur="5.66">Portugal and what we are seeing in all</text>
  <text start="285.93" dur="5.25">these countries like Greece and Portugal</text>
  <text start="288.29" dur="5.41">there are thousands and thousands of</text>
  <text start="291.18" dur="5.73">people protesting what are they</text>
  <text start="293.7" dur="5.43">protesting about well according to the</text>
  <text start="296.91" dur="4.77">bailout agreement in all these countries</text>
  <text start="299.13" dur="4.8">because they&amp;#39;re so far into debt they</text>
  <text start="301.68" dur="6.99">need to do a couple of things and most</text>
  <text start="303.93" dur="8.19">of them require them require them to do</text>
  <text start="308.67" dur="5.46">push austerity cuts on the people and</text>
  <text start="312.12" dur="3.93">the people are out there protesting</text>
  <text start="314.13" dur="5.97">because as the government takes on more</text>
  <text start="316.05" dur="7.05">debt and the people always feel the pain</text>
  <text start="320.1" dur="5.07">of taking on more debt and that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="323.1" dur="4.41">they usually end up cutting and the</text>
  <text start="325.17" dur="5.69">people were out there chanting the hour</text>
  <text start="327.51" dur="6.03">has come for the government to go and</text>
  <text start="330.86" dur="5.68">they were screaming this on the top of</text>
  <text start="333.54" dur="6.15">their lungs the budget is a theft it</text>
  <text start="336.54" dur="6.53">destroys jobs steals salaries and</text>
  <text start="339.69" dur="6.06">Pensions cuts health and welfare and</text>
  <text start="343.07" dur="5.17">education and you can see what is</text>
  <text start="345.75" dur="5.04">happening at this time it happened in</text>
  <text start="348.24" dur="5.16">Greece is happening in Cyprus it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="350.79" dur="5.64">happening in Portugal Italy France all</text>
  <text start="353.4" dur="5.19">of these countries the debt is so high</text>
  <text start="356.43" dur="4.65">the government&amp;#39;s cannot make the</text>
  <text start="358.59" dur="5.01">payments of what do they do they cut</text>
  <text start="361.08" dur="4.8">everything just to make the payments</text>
  <text start="363.6" dur="5.61">they let people go there are less people</text>
  <text start="365.88" dur="5.76">working unemployment goes up now they</text>
  <text start="369.21" dur="4.98">have no revenue coming in so they have</text>
  <text start="371.64" dur="5.34">to ask for another bailout and sooner or</text>
  <text start="374.19" dur="5.07">later if they just can&amp;#39;t take on any</text>
  <text start="376.98" dur="3.63">more debt and the country collapses and</text>
  <text start="379.26" dur="5.91">we&amp;#39;re seeing this happen actually in</text>
  <text start="380.61" dur="9.9">Greece right now Greece is seeing many</text>
  <text start="385.17" dur="8.37">many bad loans right now and these bad</text>
  <text start="390.51" dur="5.46">loans are more than double capital base</text>
  <text start="393.54" dur="4.83">the amount of non-performing loans has</text>
  <text start="395.97" dur="6.51">exploded by a laughable amount of about</text>
  <text start="398.37" dur="7.89">fifty percent in the US this would mean</text>
  <text start="402.48" dur="5.3">that some 1.7 trillion in loans were was</text>
  <text start="406.26" dur="3.68">non-performing</text>
  <text start="407.78" dur="6.24">we can see this this is just getting</text>
  <text start="409.94" dur="7.05">worse all of these countries the debt</text>
  <text start="414.02" dur="6.149">the unemployment is getting worse sales</text>
  <text start="416.99" dur="6.02">for retail getting worse housing are in</text>
  <text start="420.169" dur="6.031">bubble other countries housing is</text>
  <text start="423.01" dur="6.159">imploding we see the whole eurozone the</text>
  <text start="426.2" dur="5.49">unemployment has now been ticking up</text>
  <text start="429.169" dur="4.921">after we got through these manipulated</text>
  <text start="431.69" dur="4.92">numbers and the truth came out so we can</text>
  <text start="434.09" dur="5.549">see what is happening and here in the US</text>
  <text start="436.61" dur="6.84">same thing the unemployment is</text>
  <text start="439.639" dur="6.451">completely manipulated it is an illusion</text>
  <text start="443.45" dur="5.58">and the real unemployment is approaching</text>
  <text start="446.09" dur="4.71">twenty four percent but they want to</text>
  <text start="449.03" dur="4.71">split they want us to believe that</text>
  <text start="450.8" dur="6.65">everything is okay and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="453.74" dur="7.16">is that the US manufacturing PMI double</text>
  <text start="457.45" dur="5.92">tumbled from 52.8 percent 250</text>
  <text start="460.9" dur="6.63">one-point-eight percent the lowest since</text>
  <text start="463.37" dur="6.89">October 2012 and the new orders are</text>
  <text start="467.53" dur="7.17">increasing at the slowest pace since</text>
  <text start="470.26" dur="8.2">April now a couple reports back I</text>
  <text start="474.7" dur="5.65">reported on automobile sales and how</text>
  <text start="478.46" dur="5.19">they had to get the subprime people</text>
  <text start="480.35" dur="6.09">involved to pump up auto sales and that</text>
  <text start="483.65" dur="7.98">wasn&amp;#39;t even working so what is happening</text>
  <text start="486.44" dur="8.13">right now is GM is trying to show that</text>
  <text start="491.63" dur="7.17">things are getting better so what are</text>
  <text start="494.57" dur="6.78">they doing well first of all the volt</text>
  <text start="498.8" dur="4.38">sales that is their electric car they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="501.35" dur="5.31">those sales are plunging by thirty two</text>
  <text start="503.18" dur="8.07">percent right now and what else is</text>
  <text start="506.66" dur="10.59">happening well GM is using some tricks</text>
  <text start="511.25" dur="10.37">here to fool people they are using</text>
  <text start="517.25" dur="7.08">something called channel stuffing and</text>
  <text start="521.62" dur="4.81">they stuffed channels and what this</text>
  <text start="524.33" dur="5.31">means is and I have the definition here</text>
  <text start="526.43" dur="6.12">it is a deceptive business practice used</text>
  <text start="529.64" dur="5.61">by a company to inflate its sales and</text>
  <text start="532.55" dur="6.539">earning figures by deliberately spending</text>
  <text start="535.25" dur="6.17">retailers deliberately sending retailers</text>
  <text start="539.089" dur="4.521">along its distribution channel more pro</text>
  <text start="541.42" dur="4.64">products then they are able to sell to</text>
  <text start="543.61" dur="4.68">the public by channel stuffing</text>
  <text start="546.06" dur="5.86">distributors temporarily beef up their</text>
  <text start="548.29" dur="5.94">accounts receivable however unable to</text>
  <text start="551.92" dur="4.23">sell the excess products retailers will</text>
  <text start="554.23" dur="3.96">send the excess items instead of cash</text>
  <text start="556.15" dur="4.44">back to the distributor who must</text>
  <text start="558.19" dur="4.56">readjust its accounts receivable and</text>
  <text start="560.59" dur="4.8">ultimately its bottom line in other</text>
  <text start="562.75" dur="4.65">words stuffing always catches up with</text>
  <text start="565.39" dur="5.13">the company because it cannot maintain</text>
  <text start="567.4" dur="5.07">sales at the rate it is stuffing this is</text>
  <text start="570.52" dur="4.4">usually done fraudulently to raise the</text>
  <text start="572.47" dur="7.53">value of the stock and it is illegal so</text>
  <text start="574.92" dur="8.76">this is what GM is doing and this is the</text>
  <text start="580" dur="6.54">biggest reason why they have a surge in</text>
  <text start="583.68" dur="6.88">deliveries because what they are doing</text>
  <text start="586.54" dur="7.38">is they are pushing out their</text>
  <text start="590.56" dur="5.16">automobiles to all the dealerships right</text>
  <text start="593.92" dur="4.08">now there are seven hundred and twenty</text>
  <text start="595.72" dur="5.28">eight thousand units in dealer inventory</text>
  <text start="598" dur="5.73">at month end or eighty seven days of</text>
  <text start="601" dur="6.15">supply this was the highest number since</text>
  <text start="603.73" dur="5.76">March 2013 but fought but far more</text>
  <text start="607.15" dur="6.18">disturbing the monthly rate of increase</text>
  <text start="609.49" dur="6.93">was the highest since GM GM emergence as</text>
  <text start="613.33" dur="5.16">a new company from bankruptcy and this</text>
  <text start="616.42" dur="4.35">is the biggest two month jump in the</text>
  <text start="618.49" dur="4.59">restructured company&amp;#39;s history so what</text>
  <text start="620.77" dur="5.61">they did was they pushed more vehicles</text>
  <text start="623.08" dur="5.94">out to the dealerships they have more</text>
  <text start="626.38" dur="5.67">inventory on their Lots they have 87</text>
  <text start="629.02" dur="10.91">days worth of inventory and guess what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="632.05" dur="13.11">going to happen these retail</text>
  <text start="639.93" dur="7.84">distributors are not going to be able to</text>
  <text start="645.16" dur="6.51">push these vehicles and this will</text>
  <text start="647.77" dur="5.55">eventually cap catch up to GM and this</text>
  <text start="651.67" dur="4.08">is when you&amp;#39;ll see the Automobile</text>
  <text start="653.32" dur="5.61">Manufacturers start to implode on</text>
  <text start="655.75" dur="5.82">themselves this happened back in 2008</text>
  <text start="658.93" dur="5.04">where there were so many cars on the</text>
  <text start="661.57" dur="5.52">dealerships it was all bloated and</text>
  <text start="663.97" dur="4.95">everything boom just imploded because</text>
  <text start="667.09" dur="4.53">the dealerships just couldn&amp;#39;t sell the</text>
  <text start="668.92" dur="6.09">cars so where do they end up going they</text>
  <text start="671.62" dur="6.75">end up going back to the manufacturer</text>
  <text start="675.01" dur="5.43">now how else do we know the economy is</text>
  <text start="678.37" dur="5.19">not doing as well as they&amp;#39;d like us to</text>
  <text start="680.44" dur="4.89">believe well we understand that the</text>
  <text start="683.56" dur="4.32">unemployment rate is going down but we</text>
  <text start="685.33" dur="4.65">really understand it&amp;#39;s not this is an</text>
  <text start="687.88" dur="5.34">illusion it&amp;#39;s made up and we understand</text>
  <text start="689.98" dur="5.01">that for all these full-time jobs that</text>
  <text start="693.22" dur="5.52">are being lost people are taking on</text>
  <text start="694.99" dur="9.48">temporary work and since President Obama</text>
  <text start="698.74" dur="8.88">has taken office the real median earning</text>
  <text start="704.47" dur="7.32">of both men and women has dropped it is</text>
  <text start="707.62" dur="6.87">now down three-point-two percent and we</text>
  <text start="711.79" dur="7.67">can see it is continually dropping why</text>
  <text start="714.49" dur="8.25">because as the unemployment goes up</text>
  <text start="719.46" dur="5.11">underemployment goes up and people are</text>
  <text start="722.74" dur="4.17">taking on part-time work people are</text>
  <text start="724.57" dur="4.44">either not making an income or the</text>
  <text start="726.91" dur="5.1">income that they&amp;#39;re bringing in is much</text>
  <text start="729.01" dur="4.77">much less than it was before and this is</text>
  <text start="732.01" dur="4.89">starting to now we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="733.78" dur="5.01">the effect of all of this yes they might</text>
  <text start="736.9" dur="4.62">include those people who are working</text>
  <text start="738.79" dur="5.91">part-time as someone who is employed in</text>
  <text start="741.52" dur="6.3">the BLS numbers but we have to</text>
  <text start="744.7" dur="5.61">understand that they are not counting</text>
  <text start="747.82" dur="4.74">all those people that are no longer</text>
  <text start="750.31" dur="4.17">working and those people who found</text>
  <text start="752.56" dur="4.88">part-time work who are coming from</text>

  <text start="1022.3" dur="3.6">really sound surprising to anyone not to</text>

  <text start="1025.9" dur="5.7">constitution and we understand why this</text>
  <text start="1029.26" dur="4.65">has come about because it seems like</text>
  <text start="1031.6" dur="4.56">under the three phases of what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1033.91" dur="4.41">trying to occur about disarming the</text>

  <text start="1047.47" dur="4.62">great doesn&amp;#39;t it it almost sounds like</text>
  <text start="1048.85" dur="5.55">the Affordable Care Act which the titles</text>

  <text start="1054.4" dur="7.5">is actually so we pay our bills Act what</text>
  <text start="1059.11" dur="6.36">would this do this would grant Obama and</text>
  <text start="1061.9" dur="5.67">all other presidents the authority to</text>
  <text start="1065.47" dur="5.33">increase the legal limit on the federal</text>
  <text start="1067.57" dur="6.18">government&amp;#39;s debt unless Congress</text>
  <text start="1070.8" dur="5.74">disapproves of it so what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1073.75" dur="7.62">taking the power away from Congress</text>
  <text start="1076.54" dur="7.38">because if i&amp;#39;m not mistaken article 1</text>
  <text start="1081.37" dur="5.43">section 8 Clause 2 of the Constitution</text>
  <text start="1083.92" dur="5.01">it plainly states the Congress shall</text>

  <text start="1088.93" dur="4.53">credit of the United States and nowhere</text>
  <text start="1091.69" dur="5.79">does it say anything about the president</text>
  <text start="1093.46" dur="6.06">doing it but this bill permanently</text>
  <text start="1097.48" dur="4.59">allows Congress to disapprove debt</text>
  <text start="1099.52" dur="4.41">ceiling increases instead of approving</text>
  <text start="1102.07" dur="3.84">them in other words this bill takes</text>
  <text start="1103.93" dur="3.96">members of Congress off the hook for</text>
  <text start="1105.91" dur="3.96">voting on an increase of the dead</text>
  <text start="1107.89" dur="4.23">thereby putting members on the record</text>
  <text start="1109.87" dur="5.04">with their vote the president could just</text>
  <text start="1112.12" dur="4.86">certify that he is that he was going to</text>
  <text start="1114.91" dur="5.49">increase the debt limit and Congress</text>
  <text start="1116.98" dur="6.56">could just let him and this is</text>
  <text start="1120.4" dur="6.84">completely against the Constitution</text>
  <text start="1123.54" dur="7.66">Congress is the only legislative body</text>
  <text start="1127.24" dur="8.73">that in that can increase decrease and</text>
  <text start="1131.2" dur="9.15">do anything that has to do with the the</text>

  <text start="1146.71" dur="5.37">understand how all of a sudden well I do</text>
  <text start="1149.26" dur="4.59">understand but we can see that the</text>
  <text start="1152.08" dur="4.08">Constitution means nothing to these</text>
  <text start="1153.85" dur="4.68">people anymore they are not following it</text>
  <text start="1156.16" dur="5.7">they think they can just make any type</text>
  <text start="1158.53" dur="6.68">of law that will override the constant</text>
  <text start="1161.86" dur="7.98">Constitution but I hate to say it</text>
  <text start="1165.21" dur="7.84">Marbury vs. Madison states that any law</text>
  <text start="1169.84" dur="6.63">that is in conflict with the</text>

  <text start="1200.02" dur="5.46">their spying have something on all these</text>
  <text start="1202.63" dur="4.7">judges and on the Supreme Court and what</text>

  <text start="1207.33" dur="4.93">make their decision in favor of them</text>
  <text start="1210.07" dur="6.72">because we see it happening in New York</text>

  <text start="1241.39" dur="7.89">what is going on here now Feinstein went</text>
  <text start="1245.41" dur="7.89">into a closed Senate hearing to discuss</text>

  <text start="1311.62" dur="5.25">them to continually do what they are</text>
  <text start="1314.2" dur="5.01">doing and you have to remember that</text>
  <text start="1316.87" dur="5.52">Dianne Feinstein was also putting forth</text>
  <text start="1319.21" dur="6.75">a bill that would make it illegal to</text>
  <text start="1322.39" dur="6.24">talk badly about the NSA spying program</text>

  <text start="1336.83" dur="7.8">okay let&amp;#39;s move on here now we have to</text>
  <text start="1340.7" dur="5.67">remember that the elite globalist</text>
  <text start="1344.63" dur="3.75">central bankers US government Israel</text>

  <text start="1374.24" dur="7.11">this is important is because we have to</text>
  <text start="1376.94" dur="9.839">remember that as long as they can prove</text>

  <text start="1864.14" dur="3.12">opposite of what they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="1865.7" dur="3.78">because what have I always said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1867.26" dur="3.42">always the opposite they are not looking</text>

  <text start="1870.68" dur="7.68">looking to get into Iran with a strike</text>
  <text start="1874.57" dur="6.97">so Hagel is out there and what he is</text>
  <text start="1878.36" dur="5.64">saying that the United States is testing</text>
  <text start="1881.54" dur="6.09">Iran&amp;#39;s diplomatic intention but remains</text>
  <text start="1884" dur="7.34">clear-eyed on Iran&amp;#39;s role as a state</text>

  <text start="1891.34" dur="8.62">extremism and terrorism to the United</text>

  <text start="1899.96" dur="11.9">that the United States might have to use</text>
  <text start="1906.92" dur="8.85">military force against Iran the</text>
  <text start="1911.86" dur="6.76">president has all options on the table</text>
  <text start="1915.77" dur="6.63">and when it comes to negotiating over</text>
  <text start="1918.62" dur="7.74">Iran&amp;#39;s nuclear program he is ready to</text>
  <text start="1922.4" dur="7.5">talk to them but again a strike is still</text>
  <text start="1926.36" dur="5.76">on the table and using military force is</text>
  <text start="1929.9" dur="5.13">definitely on the table so you can see</text>
  <text start="1932.12" dur="4.77">what they are building up to do at this</text>
  <text start="1935.03" dur="7.26">point and they&amp;#39;re letting this out there</text>
  <text start="1936.89" dur="7.56">again and again I&amp;#39;ve said this the only</text>
  <text start="1942.29" dur="5.76">way they&amp;#39;re going to really pull this</text>
  <text start="1944.45" dur="5.88">off and we will see something we are</text>
  <text start="1948.05" dur="5.16">going to see some type of false flag</text>
  <text start="1950.33" dur="5.43">events here on American soil because the</text>
  <text start="1953.21" dur="6.33">only way to get this done at this point</text>
  <text start="1955.76" dur="5.97">is to do it and to involve the American</text>
  <text start="1959.54" dur="5.37">people because when it happens across</text>
  <text start="1961.73" dur="6.47">the seas and in far-off land nobody</text>
  <text start="1964.91" dur="7.17">cares if it happens here in the US</text>
  <text start="1968.2" dur="7.24">everyone is shocked everyone is pissed</text>
  <text start="1972.08" dur="5.49">and everyone wants revenge those people</text>
  <text start="1975.44" dur="4.47">who are still asleep don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="1977.57" dur="5.42">what is going on and this is what will</text>
  <text start="1979.91" dur="7.02">happen and this will be a multi-prong</text>
  <text start="1982.99" dur="5.71">event that will occur in the US it will</text>
  <text start="1986.93" dur="4.2">be a cyber attack it will be either</text>
  <text start="1988.7" dur="5.49">nuclear biological chemical it will</text>
  <text start="1991.13" dur="6.09">happen in many different cities and this</text>
  <text start="1994.19" dur="5.49">is definitely going to happen one way or</text>
  <text start="1997.22" dur="5.37">another because time is running out</text>
  <text start="1999.68" dur="4.44">people they understand that the collapse</text>
  <text start="2002.59" dur="5.25">is coming and then</text>
  <text start="2004.12" dur="5.55">to do something now we are seeing more</text>
  <text start="2007.84" dur="5.46">glitches in the NASDAQ and the nasdaq</text>

  <text start="2049.47" dur="4.84">it&amp;#39;s probably interrupting or doing</text>
