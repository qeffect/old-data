  <text start="89" dur="4.84">taking the control away from the central</text>
  <text start="91.649" dur="3.781">bank from the elite a lot of people</text>
  <text start="93.84" dur="4.17">don&amp;#39;t see this a lot of people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="95.43" dur="4.65">recognize it and sometimes it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="98.01" dur="4.74">look like it it looks like the opposite</text>
  <text start="100.08" dur="4.71">is happening but when we drilled down</text>
  <text start="102.75" dur="6.11">and we start to look at what is going on</text>
  <text start="104.79" dur="6.869">we can see the plan we could see a</text>
  <text start="108.86" dur="4.78">glimpse into what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="111.659" dur="4.381">now a lot of time the elite the deep</text>
  <text start="113.64" dur="4.769">state the central banks they do believe</text>
  <text start="116.04" dur="6.36">that they&amp;#39;re an absolute full control</text>
  <text start="118.409" dur="6.151">that no matter what the Patriots do they</text>
  <text start="122.4" dur="5.73">will still control them this is why we</text>
  <text start="124.56" dur="7.44">had those elite out there saying to</text>
  <text start="128.13" dur="6.6">every other country if you try to break</text>
  <text start="132" dur="5.25">away from the EU it&amp;#39;s not going to be</text>
  <text start="134.73" dur="4.65">easy why because we are in control and</text>
  <text start="137.25" dur="5.19">we will make it very difficult for you</text>
  <text start="139.38" dur="4.77">to break away now of course this is</text>
  <text start="142.44" dur="4.62">their ego of course they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="144.15" dur="6.54">understand how the Patriots work they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="147.06" dur="4.73">never dealt with the Patriots before on</text>
  <text start="150.69" dur="3.72">this level</text>
  <text start="151.79" dur="4.96">remember the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="154.41" dur="4.29">banks they&amp;#39;ve always gotten their way</text>
  <text start="156.75" dur="4.02">and the deals that they made with other</text>
  <text start="158.7" dur="4.85">countries while they&amp;#39;re all on the same</text>
  <text start="160.77" dur="5.55">side now</text>
  <text start="163.55" dur="4.63">they have to deal with the Patriots it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="166.32" dur="4.47">a little different dealing with the</text>
  <text start="168.18" dur="5.4">Patriots and this brings us to the UK</text>
  <text start="170.79" dur="5.76">because Boris Johnson he delivered a</text>
  <text start="173.58" dur="5.97">plan to the elite the the EU the central</text>
  <text start="176.55" dur="8.49">bankers and it resembled Theresa Mayes</text>
  <text start="179.55" dur="8.13">deal but that&amp;#39;s it they might have</text>
  <text start="185.04" dur="5.58">resembled it but it&amp;#39;s not the same deal</text>
  <text start="187.68" dur="4.59">why Boris Johnson changed the wording</text>
  <text start="190.62" dur="7.29">within the deal</text>
  <text start="192.27" dur="9.03">Mich talk explains the differences if we</text>
  <text start="197.91" dur="3.75">look at the custom Union this is the big</text>
  <text start="201.3" dur="3.33">one</text>
  <text start="201.66" dur="5.55">under Johnson&amp;#39;s deal the UK will leave</text>
  <text start="204.63" dur="5.58">the e use custom union allowing it to</text>
  <text start="207.21" dur="5.37">strike its own trade deals with other</text>
  <text start="210.21" dur="4.71">countries under Mays proposal the</text>
  <text start="212.58" dur="4.17">country would have to stay in at least</text>
  <text start="214.92" dur="4.71">until it had reached a free trade</text>

  <text start="227.989" dur="10.061">he&amp;#39;s allowing the UK to make deals with</text>
  <text start="232.53" dur="8.79">other countries right off the bat he</text>
  <text start="238.05" dur="6.09">also has a level playing field on EU</text>
  <text start="241.32" dur="5.61">rules Johnson wants to give himself</text>
  <text start="244.14" dur="5.16">greater room to diverge from EU rules</text>
  <text start="246.93" dur="4.68">for example social and environmental</text>

  <text start="456.55" dur="3.45">failed in fact the w.a was never</text>
  <text start="459.43" dur="3.6">approved</text>
  <text start="460" dur="7.38">so if Johnson&amp;#39;s deal is approved it will</text>
  <text start="463.03" dur="8.009">still contain the trap door Johnson</text>
  <text start="467.38" dur="8.34">could still opt for a WTO brexit if the</text>

  <text start="484.06" dur="8.88">the deal there&amp;#39;s a trapdoor clause in</text>
  <text start="487.33" dur="10.98">there which he could use he set the EU</text>
  <text start="492.94" dur="7.979">up they need to bow to him now now</text>
  <text start="498.31" dur="4.26">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that around</text>
  <text start="500.919" dur="5.28">the world we know that the global</text>
  <text start="502.57" dur="4.83">economy is slowing down and we know this</text>
  <text start="506.199" dur="4.77">has nothing to do with the trade Wars</text>
  <text start="507.4" dur="7.23">it&amp;#39;s been slowing down since Obama was</text>
  <text start="510.969" dur="5.851">president and like always the IMF is out</text>
  <text start="514.63" dur="6.24">there telling everyone that the global</text>

  <text start="520.87" dur="4.8">course they blamed it on Trump but we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="523.36" dur="4.5">seen in the past they always revise</text>
  <text start="525.67" dur="4.919">their numbers even when Trump was not in</text>

  <text start="534.37" dur="6.719">forecast to 1.2 percent this year from</text>
  <text start="537.18" dur="7.469">1.3 percent and I believe they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="541.089" dur="7.281">cut this even further as time goes on</text>
  <text start="544.649" dur="8.011">because the entire eurozone is</text>

  <text start="555.91" dur="6.06">in negative rate territory this is a</text>
  <text start="559.75" dur="4.35">no-win situation for them</text>
  <text start="561.97" dur="5.82">they never expected this to go on this</text>
  <text start="564.1" dur="6.599">long they never expected Trump to win or</text>
  <text start="567.79" dur="5.13">Clinton to lose and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
