  <text start="131.54" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s just falling apart and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="134.54" dur="3.78">following retail we&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="136.16" dur="3.77">housing we&amp;#39;ve been following all this</text>
  <text start="138.32" dur="3.54">and we&amp;#39;ve been seeing it break down</text>
  <text start="139.93" dur="6.16">every step of the way now</text>
  <text start="141.86" dur="6.42">we&amp;#39;ve been detailing and showing how</text>
  <text start="146.09" dur="3.66">retail is completely falling apart and</text>
  <text start="148.28" dur="3.87">we were saying that retail was falling</text>
  <text start="149.75" dur="4.23">apart way before it started to fall</text>
  <text start="152.15" dur="3.66">apart because back when Obama was</text>
  <text start="153.98" dur="4.289">president we were looking at retail and</text>
  <text start="155.81" dur="5.07">each holiday season was getting worse</text>
  <text start="158.269" dur="5.071">and worse and worse and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="160.88" dur="5.28">stores started to close and we heard of</text>
  <text start="163.34" dur="5.34">bankruptcies and all of a sudden they</text>
  <text start="166.16" dur="4.41">called it the retail apocalypse but this</text>
  <text start="168.68" dur="4.32">is what happens when you continually</text>
  <text start="170.57" dur="5.13">follow it you know it just didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="173" dur="5.09">overnight you know that everything that</text>
  <text start="175.7" dur="5.48">we looked at led up to that point and</text>
  <text start="178.09" dur="7.539">now we see more and more stores closing</text>
  <text start="181.18" dur="5.41">they&amp;#39;re expecting 3,800 stores to close</text>
  <text start="185.629" dur="3.271">across</text>
  <text start="186.59" dur="5.64">the country this year and we know you</text>
  <text start="188.9" dur="6.48">know Kmart Macy&amp;#39;s Sears JCPenney Best</text>
  <text start="192.23" dur="5.37">Buy paleis and the rest they&amp;#39;re deciding</text>
  <text start="195.38" dur="4.44">to close more and more of these stores</text>
  <text start="197.6" dur="5.46">now remember these stores do have an</text>
  <text start="199.82" dur="5.31">online presence it&amp;#39;s not like oh wow we</text>
  <text start="203.06" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t have anything online you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="205.13" dur="5.04">purchasing anything online many of these</text>
  <text start="207.92" dur="3.36">stores you&amp;#39;re able to purchase and go</text>
  <text start="210.17" dur="2.37">right to the store and pick it up you</text>
  <text start="211.28" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t even have to wait for it to be</text>
  <text start="212.54" dur="5.97">shipped to your house or you can have it</text>
  <text start="214.64" dur="6.39">shipped to your house free of charge so</text>
  <text start="218.51" dur="5.1">what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is that people</text>
  <text start="221.03" dur="5.31">they just don&amp;#39;t have the funds to go out</text>
  <text start="223.61" dur="6.18">and purchase the goods now there&amp;#39;s a new</text>
  <text start="226.34" dur="6.3">report which was released by a real</text>
  <text start="229.79" dur="5.64">estate research firm Ries and it noticed</text>
  <text start="232.64" dur="7.83">that shopping malls had not been this</text>
  <text start="235.43" dur="7.29">empty since 2012 the vacancy rate at</text>

  <text start="245.51" dur="6.3">quarter of 2018 up from 8.4 percent in</text>
  <text start="248.81" dur="4.32">the prior quarter and they listed you</text>
  <text start="251.81" dur="3.84">know all the stores that has shut down</text>
  <text start="253.13" dur="5.97">and some of the biggest retailers about</text>
  <text start="255.65" dur="5.91">57 of them they closed their stores and</text>
  <text start="259.1" dur="5.61">we know it&amp;#39;s Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch closed</text>
  <text start="261.56" dur="5.31">a lot of stores Aeropostale aerosols</text>

  <text start="269.81" dur="6.18">BCBG beep BB and it goes the list goes</text>
  <text start="273.65" dur="5.579">on and on and on but what we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="275.99" dur="6.27">out of this is that there are still more</text>
  <text start="279.229" dur="4.951">stores that are going to close this is</text>
  <text start="282.26" dur="3.96">what happens when people don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="284.18" dur="5.22">full-time jobs when people are making a</text>
  <text start="286.22" dur="5.25">lot less money wages are declining when</text>
  <text start="289.4" dur="4.769">we&amp;#39;re at the end of a central banking</text>
  <text start="291.47" dur="4.53">system we start to see all this start to</text>
  <text start="294.169" dur="3.961">break down and we started to see this</text>
  <text start="296" dur="4.59">breakdown right after 2008 when</text>
  <text start="298.13" dur="4.05">everything collapsed which at that point</text>
  <text start="300.59" dur="3.389">everything should have just continually</text>
  <text start="302.18" dur="3.75">collapsed and we should have had a new</text>
  <text start="303.979" dur="3.961">system at that time it&amp;#39;s hopefully not a</text>
  <text start="305.93" dur="4.739">central bank system but we needed the</text>
  <text start="307.94" dur="4.229">central banking system to go away they</text>
  <text start="310.669" dur="3.961">propped it up they propped it up for</text>
  <text start="312.169" dur="4.521">many more years and now we see many</text>
  <text start="314.63" dur="5.259">countries moving away from the dollar</text>
  <text start="316.69" dur="5.33">dumping Treasuries</text>
  <text start="319.889" dur="4.65">eating the same thing that we have here</text>
  <text start="322.02" dur="6.449">in the West the trading systems the gold</text>
  <text start="324.539" dur="5.22">exchange systems payment systems a lot</text>

  <text start="329.759" dur="5.581">gold purchases dumping their Treasuries</text>
  <text start="332.55" dur="5.489">and Russia has been in the forefront</text>

  <text start="433.11" dur="5.339">been happening over the many many years</text>
  <text start="434.939" dur="6">now we know that Trump needs to fill the</text>

  <text start="471.77" dur="5.58">coming out and letting everyone realize</text>
  <text start="474.53" dur="5.49">that the Fed is doing things like</text>
  <text start="477.35" dur="6">raising rates we have debt coming too</text>
  <text start="480.02" dur="5.46">but again it&amp;#39;s up to the Fed and we need</text>
  <text start="483.35" dur="5.34">to remember that the Fed is a leader in</text>
  <text start="485.48" dur="5.49">pushing stringent regulation on the</text>
  <text start="488.69" dur="5.07">nation they&amp;#39;re raising interest rates</text>

  <text start="497.06" dur="6.9">further growth in the American economy</text>
  <text start="500.5" dur="5.83">the Fed is the problem the central</text>
  <text start="503.96" dur="5.55">banking system is the problem because it</text>
  <text start="506.33" dur="5.37">wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to go on this long we</text>
  <text start="509.51" dur="4.29">were supposed to have an event a war or</text>
  <text start="511.7" dur="5.01">something else to explain away why this</text>
  <text start="513.8" dur="4.83">system is failing how do they explain it</text>
  <text start="516.71" dur="4.829">away now it&amp;#39;s becoming very very</text>
  <text start="518.63" dur="5.82">difficult and the move is on right now</text>
  <text start="521.539" dur="5.821">to get rid of the central banking system</text>
  <text start="524.45" dur="5.61">the countries at this point they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="527.36" dur="4.56">ready to move away from the dollar and</text>
  <text start="530.06" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;re already starting to see this</text>
  <text start="531.92" dur="4.71">happen once Russia does China is going</text>
  <text start="534.92" dur="3.78">to be right behind them other countries</text>
  <text start="536.63" dur="4.62">are gonna be right behind Russia and</text>
  <text start="538.7" dur="4.53">China and all of a sudden countries are</text>
  <text start="541.25" dur="3.57">gonna be moving to a different currency</text>
  <text start="543.23" dur="4.41">we know that the African nations right</text>
  <text start="544.82" dur="5.58">now they&amp;#39;re already stating that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="547.64" dur="6">no reason for us to have dollars in</text>
  <text start="550.4" dur="6.059">reserve we deal with China with you one</text>
  <text start="553.64" dur="5.66">so why are we using the dollar let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="556.459" dur="7.021">bypass the dollar and just use the yuan</text>
  <text start="559.3" dur="8.89">all that we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is a</text>
  <text start="563.48" dur="6.96">move to move away from the dollar the</text>
  <text start="568.19" dur="4.649">system is coming to an end</text>
  <text start="570.44" dur="4.519">the central bank will be coming to an</text>
  <text start="572.839" dur="5.641">end we&amp;#39;ll be moving to a different</text>
  <text start="574.959" dur="5.38">currency system and I do believe the</text>
  <text start="578.48" dur="4.17">whole entire goal of this is to move</text>
  <text start="580.339" dur="3.781">away from a private western central</text>
  <text start="582.65" dur="3.6">banking system as we know that Putin</text>
  <text start="584.12" dur="2.85">he&amp;#39;s taking control over the central</text>
  <text start="586.25" dur="2.04">bank and I</text>
  <text start="586.97" dur="3.659">think the same thing is going to happen</text>
  <text start="588.29" dur="4.56">here in the United States Trump the</text>
  <text start="590.629" dur="5.46">Patriots are going to take control of</text>
  <text start="592.85" dur="6.06">the Federal Reserve because once you</text>
  <text start="596.089" dur="5.461">have control over this there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="598.91" dur="6.989">this central banking system needs to</text>
  <text start="601.55" dur="6.87">loan the government currency the</text>
  <text start="605.899" dur="4.74">government then the people can print</text>
  <text start="608.42" dur="5.82">their own currency with no interest</text>
  <text start="610.639" dur="6.24">attached so we&amp;#39;re heading towards a</text>
