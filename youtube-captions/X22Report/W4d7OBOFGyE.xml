  <text start="112.74" dur="4.29">of a Trump&amp;#39;s presidency we know the</text>
  <text start="114.75" dur="3.75">corporate media social media was out</text>
  <text start="117.03" dur="3.54">there saying oh everything that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="118.5" dur="5.009">saying is completely fake news and they</text>
  <text start="120.57" dur="5.01">have to really clamp down on fake news</text>
  <text start="123.509" dur="4.47">and then this is where Trump started to</text>
  <text start="125.58" dur="4.8">blame the corporate media for putting</text>
  <text start="127.979" dur="5.1">out fake news and said CNN is putting</text>
  <text start="130.38" dur="5.82">out very very fake news and since that</text>
  <text start="133.079" dur="4.641">time we&amp;#39;ve noticed the corporate media</text>
  <text start="136.2" dur="4.02">they have to continually</text>
  <text start="137.72" dur="4.69">backstep on a lot of their stories we</text>
  <text start="140.22" dur="4.38">tracked a lot of their stories because a</text>
  <text start="142.41" dur="4.53">lot of their stories well they turn out</text>
  <text start="144.6" dur="5.91">to be fake and they&amp;#39;re getting caught</text>
  <text start="146.94" dur="6.99">and caught more often CNN Thursday</text>
  <text start="150.51" dur="5.64">afternoon they posted a story by a</text>
  <text start="153.93" dur="3.99">Pulitzer prize-winning reporter Thomas</text>
  <text start="156.15" dur="4.05">friend claiming that Congress was</text>
  <text start="157.92" dur="4.89">investigating a Russian investment fund</text>
  <text start="160.2" dur="4.86">with ties to Trump officials and the</text>
  <text start="162.81" dur="3.69">highlights included chronic Congress as</text>
  <text start="165.06" dur="3.63">investigating a little-known Russian</text>
  <text start="166.5" dur="3.54">investment fund the fund CEO met in</text>
  <text start="168.69" dur="3.359">January with a member of the Trump</text>
  <text start="170.04" dur="4.259">transition team the story connected</text>
  <text start="172.049" dur="4.321">Anthony scaramouche II with</text>
  <text start="174.299" dur="4.321">investigations into the Russian direct</text>
  <text start="176.37" dur="7.64">investment fund and it sounds amazing</text>
  <text start="178.62" dur="6.69">and we could see 36 hours later quietly</text>
  <text start="184.01" dur="4.21">CNN</text>
  <text start="185.31" dur="7.89">tartrate of the story apologize to mr.</text>
  <text start="188.22" dur="7.89">scar Meucci and basically added a</text>
  <text start="193.2" dur="5.28">retraction saying that the story did not</text>
  <text start="196.11" dur="4.2">meet cnn&amp;#39;s editorial standards I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="198.48" dur="6.72">even know they had editorial standards I</text>
  <text start="200.31" dur="7.23">mean how does fake basically go with any</text>
  <text start="205.2" dur="5.43">type of editorial standards it makes no</text>
  <text start="207.54" dur="6.15">sense but they use this to cover their</text>
  <text start="210.63" dur="5.79">tracks and what happened was they</text>
  <text start="213.69" dur="6.829">created this entire story with of course</text>
  <text start="216.42" dur="7.83">anonymous links and anonymous anonymous</text>
  <text start="220.519" dur="6.22">spokespeople and the whole thing turns</text>
  <text start="224.25" dur="4.62">out to be completely fake now if we when</text>
  <text start="226.739" dur="4.861">we went back in the Wayback Machine we</text>
  <text start="228.87" dur="4.02">can actually see this story and what</text>
  <text start="231.6" dur="3.03">they were doing they were trying to make</text>
  <text start="232.89" dur="6.24">these ties they&amp;#39;re trying to continue</text>
  <text start="234.63" dur="7.77">with the Russian collusion with Trump</text>
  <text start="239.13" dur="6.66">being associated with Russia but they</text>
  <text start="242.4" dur="5.4">have nothing and they keep trying and I</text>
  <text start="245.79" dur="4.8">think the corporate media right now</text>
  <text start="247.8" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re digging their own grave with all</text>
  <text start="250.59" dur="3.23">of this fake news because people are</text>
  <text start="252.51" dur="3.81">starting to look at this and saying is</text>
  <text start="253.82" dur="5.169">anything that comes out of the corporate</text>
  <text start="256.32" dur="6.81">media is anything real anymore and just</text>
  <text start="258.989" dur="6.721">because one corporate media outlet</text>
  <text start="263.13" dur="4.38">carries a story and then another one</text>
  <text start="265.71" dur="5.49">picks it up and another one picks it up</text>
  <text start="267.51" dur="6.719">doesn&amp;#39;t make it true what it means is</text>
  <text start="271.2" dur="6.48">all they do is confirm with each other</text>
  <text start="274.229" dur="5.521">that this story is true which says ok</text>
  <text start="277.68" dur="3.81">America since we have these three</text>
  <text start="279.75" dur="4.11">different places carrying the story it</text>
  <text start="281.49" dur="4.26">must be true no because they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="283.86" dur="4.2">working together it doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.75" dur="6.57">true it just means they&amp;#39;re picking up</text>
  <text start="288.06" dur="6.03">the story but they&amp;#39;ve created this to</text>
  <text start="292.32" dur="3.75">make people believe that the propaganda</text>
  <text start="294.09" dur="4.11">stories are true if more than one</text>
  <text start="296.07" dur="3.75">corporate media outlet picks it up and</text>
  <text start="298.2" dur="3.63">we know that these corporate media</text>
  <text start="299.82" dur="4.469">outlets they&amp;#39;re owned by what like 5</text>
  <text start="301.83" dur="5.459">companies now which they probably like</text>
  <text start="304.289" dur="4.591">in the end to be owned by one but we see</text>
  <text start="307.289" dur="3.241">right now that things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="308.88" dur="4.289">falling apart in the fake news</text>
  <text start="310.53" dur="4.53">department and all these checks that</text>
  <text start="313.169" dur="5.281">they&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re absolutely</text>
  <text start="315.06" dur="4.109">meaningless now we see that the United</text>
  <text start="318.45" dur="2.489">States the</text>
  <text start="319.169" dur="4.411">State they&amp;#39;re having a problem Venezuela</text>
  <text start="320.939" dur="5.85">right now United Nations Human Rights</text>
  <text start="323.58" dur="5.549">Council met in Geneva and we can see</text>
  <text start="326.789" dur="4.59">right now that the Venezuelan</text>
  <text start="329.129" dur="4.07">representative in Geneva thanked 57</text>
  <text start="331.379" dur="4.681">countries for backing them</text>
  <text start="333.199" dur="5.171">representatives from cuba nicaragua have</text>
  <text start="336.06" dur="3.9">expressed a support for the Venezuelan</text>
  <text start="338.37" dur="5.639">people and the government of Nicolas</text>
  <text start="339.96" dur="4.889">Maduro and we see that all of these</text>
  <text start="344.009" dur="4.77">countries</text>
  <text start="344.849" dur="6.5">well they respect the rights of the</text>
  <text start="348.779" dur="4.89">Venezuelan people the government and</text>
  <text start="351.349" dur="5.081">they respect the sovereignty of</text>
  <text start="353.669" dur="5.941">Venezuela and they denounce the attacks</text>
  <text start="356.43" dur="5.34">made by the United States so the deep</text>
  <text start="359.61" dur="4.41">state right now is having a problem with</text>
  <text start="361.77" dur="4.679">Venezuela we see they were trying to</text>
  <text start="364.02" dur="4.23">push their agenda to get into Venezuela</text>
  <text start="366.449" dur="5.611">and it looks like it is not working so</text>
  <text start="368.25" dur="6.389">most likely we will we will probably see</text>
  <text start="372.06" dur="5.039">full slag type of events occur in</text>
  <text start="374.639" dur="5.64">Venezuela to really bring this to the</text>
  <text start="377.099" dur="6.151">next level we see right now there is a</text>
  <text start="380.279" dur="5.461">problem in Yemen the u.s. is once again</text>
  <text start="383.25" dur="5.009">facing allegations of torture this time</text>
  <text start="385.74" dur="4.799">during the interrogation of detainees in</text>
  <text start="388.259" dur="4.53">more than a dozen secret prisons in</text>
  <text start="390.539" dur="4.86">Yemen and we can see there are</text>
  <text start="392.789" dur="4.921">unprecedented reports from the corporate</text>
  <text start="395.399" dur="4.8">press claiming the US forces have</text>
  <text start="397.71" dur="4.35">participated in extreme torture and</text>
  <text start="400.199" dur="3.81">abuse of detainees accused of</text>
  <text start="402.06" dur="5.039">affiliation with al-qaeda in Yemen</text>
  <text start="404.009" dur="5.94">including the grill in which the victims</text>
  <text start="407.099" dur="6.03">are tied to a spit and they are spun</text>
  <text start="409.949" dur="5.011">over a fire and we can see the human</text>
  <text start="413.129" dur="4.081">rights organization is looking into this</text>
  <text start="414.96" dur="5.25">and we see that Yemen is a complete</text>
  <text start="417.21" dur="6.629">disaster the United States needs to get</text>
  <text start="420.21" dur="6.75">out of this entire area Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="423.839" dur="6.151">needs to get out of this entire area let</text>
  <text start="426.96" dur="5.699">the people of this country decide what</text>
  <text start="429.99" dur="4.38">they want the same thing goes with Libya</text>
  <text start="432.659" dur="3.63">the same thing goes with Iraq the same</text>
  <text start="434.37" dur="5.099">thing goes with Syria but we know the</text>
  <text start="436.289" dur="6.331">deep state they love empire building</text>
  <text start="439.469" dur="5.461">they love regime change and this is why</text>
  <text start="442.62" dur="5.13">we see all this because what they do is</text>
  <text start="444.93" dur="5.579">they torture the people if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="447.75" dur="5.36">agree with what they want if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="450.509" dur="4.43">agree with the puppet government</text>
  <text start="453.11" dur="4.079">well then we have to call you al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="454.939" dur="3.961">then you&amp;#39;re bombed you&amp;#39;re tortured and</text>
  <text start="457.189" dur="4.621">this is what we see happening all over</text>
  <text start="458.9" dur="6.21">the place Iraqi forces they&amp;#39;ve opened</text>
  <text start="461.81" dur="6.389">exit routes for hundreds of civilians to</text>
  <text start="465.11" dur="6.209">flee the old city of Mosul and we see</text>
  <text start="468.199" dur="4.921">right now that the Iraqi forces they are</text>
  <text start="471.319" dur="3.9">actually fighting the Islamic actually</text>
  <text start="473.12" dur="3.75">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is a lot of these</text>
  <text start="475.219" dur="4.04">countries they are fighting the Islamic</text>
  <text start="476.87" dur="6.269">state and we&amp;#39;re starting to see things</text>
  <text start="479.259" dur="7.181">slowly change where instead of just</text>
  <text start="483.139" dur="5.46">bombing around the area of the Islamic</text>
  <text start="486.44" dur="5.189">state destroying the infrastructure</text>
  <text start="488.599" dur="5.641">letting the Islamic state gain more</text>
  <text start="491.629" dur="5.311">ground we&amp;#39;re actually seeing the</text>
  <text start="494.24" dur="5.459">destruction of the Islamic state even</text>
  <text start="496.94" dur="5.069">from the coalition forces because we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="499.699" dur="4.351">reached a point where they understand</text>
  <text start="502.009" dur="5.791">and they know these terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="504.05" dur="7.41">they don&amp;#39;t need them anymore plus Trump</text>
  <text start="507.8" dur="6.81">has given the Pentagon control of going</text>
  <text start="511.46" dur="5.91">after the Islamic I remember Obama had</text>
  <text start="514.61" dur="6.719">that control and actually dictated the</text>
  <text start="517.37" dur="6.359">target to the Pentagon because this was</text>
  <text start="521.329" dur="5.101">part of their plan this is where we want</text>
  <text start="523.729" dur="5.281">you to bomb no questions just do what I</text>
  <text start="526.43" dur="5.64">say which allowed the Islamic state to</text>
  <text start="529.01" dur="7.139">gain more and more ground now we see the</text>
  <text start="532.07" dur="7.35">opposite happening now Israel decided to</text>
  <text start="536.149" dur="5.041">attack the southern area of the Golan</text>
  <text start="539.42" dur="4.68">Heights they&amp;#39;re saying that there were</text>
  <text start="541.19" dur="5.61">10 shells fired from the Syrian side and</text>
  <text start="544.1" dur="5.31">we know they do this all the time do you</text>
  <text start="546.8" dur="5.67">really think Syria right now really is</text>
  <text start="549.41" dur="6.48">firing on Israel in this area to start</text>
  <text start="552.47" dur="6.03">another war no we know that Israel has</text>
  <text start="555.89" dur="5.309">been basically supporting the Islamic</text>
  <text start="558.5" dur="4.62">state al Qaeda the moderate rebels just</text>
  <text start="561.199" dur="3.961">like the United States just like the UK</text>
  <text start="563.12" dur="4.29">and the coalition forces this has been</text>
  <text start="565.16" dur="3.75">going on for a very long time what</text>
  <text start="567.41" dur="5.16">they&amp;#39;re trying to do is they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="568.91" dur="5.91">to assist them still now Russia is out</text>
  <text start="572.57" dur="4.23">there and they&amp;#39;re starting to realize</text>
  <text start="574.82" dur="3.81">what is happening here and I think</text>
  <text start="576.8" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;ve known this for a very long time</text>
  <text start="578.63" dur="4.86">and I think this is part of the plan of</text>
  <text start="580.31" dur="6.57">the Trump administration and Putin where</text>
  <text start="583.49" dur="5.94">they can actually stop the deep state in</text>
  <text start="586.88" dur="4.83">tracts now we know that the high Mars</text>
  <text start="589.43" dur="4.11">multiple launch rocket system was</text>
  <text start="591.71" dur="4.26">brought in from a base in Jordan and</text>
  <text start="593.54" dur="4.47">brought into the alt AF area in Syria</text>

  <text start="599.96" dur="4.89">Senate seventy kilometers to the north</text>
  <text start="601.58" dur="5.19">east of alt F now the region of Alton</text>
  <text start="604.85" dur="3">has turned into a strategically</text>
  <text start="606.77" dur="3.41">important point</text>
  <text start="607.85" dur="5.1">the Syrian army alongside its allies</text>
  <text start="610.18" dur="6.01">well they&amp;#39;ve been advancing to the east</text>
  <text start="612.95" dur="5.76">along the Damascus Baghdad Highway a</text>
  <text start="616.19" dur="5.46">strategic route in southeastern Syria</text>
  <text start="618.71" dur="5.19">the highway is also a strategic interest</text>
  <text start="621.65" dur="5.13">for the coalition forces in the area of</text>
  <text start="623.9" dur="7.2">Alton where Syria borders Iraq and</text>

  <text start="649.64" dur="4.65">support them now they&amp;#39;re clearing out</text>
  <text start="651.62" dur="5.43">the area so they can have the area of</text>
  <text start="654.29" dur="6.48">the Islamic state this is the first</text>
  <text start="657.05" dur="6.3">stage of splitting up Syria and we see</text>
  <text start="660.77" dur="4.56">right now the Pentagon is building up</text>
  <text start="663.35" dur="5.01">its presence in order to divide the</text>
  <text start="665.33" dur="6">territory of the sovereign area of Syria</text>
  <text start="668.36" dur="6.96">now this is the deep state where they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="681.17" dur="3.06">terrorist groups now Russia is</text>
  <text start="682.46" dur="3.21">definitely reporting on this because</text>
  <text start="684.23" dur="2.79">they&amp;#39;ve been monitoring the strikes and</text>
  <text start="685.67" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re seeing that yes they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="687.02" dur="3.93">carrying out the strikes and actually</text>
  <text start="688.73" dur="4.02">hitting the Islamic state now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="690.95" dur="5.61">very interesting about this and this was</text>
  <text start="692.75" dur="6.48">buried in The Associated Press and this</text>
  <text start="696.56" dur="5.58">is coming from armored army Colonel Ryan</text>
  <text start="699.23" dur="6.48">Dillon a spokesman for the coalition and</text>
  <text start="702.14" dur="5.67">he said something very interesting he</text>
  <text start="705.71" dur="4.29">told reporters at the Pentagon that the</text>
  <text start="707.81" dur="5.49">u.s. goal is to defeat the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="710" dur="5.7">wherever it exists if others including</text>
  <text start="713.3" dur="5.19">the Syrian government and its Iranian</text>
  <text start="715.7" dur="4.95">and Russian allies want to fight the</text>
  <text start="718.49" dur="5.31">extremists as well then we</text>
  <text start="720.65" dur="7.35">absolutely have no problem with that</text>
  <text start="723.8" dur="7.35">they can join in with the fight and both</text>
  <text start="728" dur="4.47">the coalition and these other forces the</text>
  <text start="731.15" dur="4.23">Syrian government the Iranian forces</text>
  <text start="732.47" dur="5.85">they can all go after the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="735.38" dur="6.66">so something has changed right now and I</text>
  <text start="738.32" dur="5.64">think what they&amp;#39;re doing is they are</text>
  <text start="742.04" dur="4.71">definitely going after the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="743.96" dur="5.13">clearing this out and we know the deep</text>
  <text start="746.75" dur="5.22">state they want to split up Syria and I</text>
  <text start="749.09" dur="4.41">think this is where Trump and Putin this</text>
  <text start="751.97" dur="3.63">is where they&amp;#39;re going to stop them</text>
  <text start="753.5" dur="3.87">because once the Islamic state is</text>
  <text start="755.6" dur="3.6">completely cleared out of the country I</text>
  <text start="757.37" dur="4.32">think what they&amp;#39;re going to say is</text>
  <text start="759.2" dur="3.6">there&amp;#39;s no reason for the u.s. to be</text>
  <text start="761.69" dur="3.18">there now the deep state is going to</text>
  <text start="762.8" dur="4.44">push their agenda to say the Kurds need</text>
  <text start="764.87" dur="5.01">their own territory but we can see right</text>
  <text start="767.24" dur="5.7">now this is not up to the u.s. it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="769.88" dur="5.61">up to the Kurds it&amp;#39;s up to the people</text>
  <text start="772.94" dur="5.55">inside of Syria to make this decision</text>
  <text start="775.49" dur="6.33">and I think Russia is going to push that</text>
  <text start="778.49" dur="6.06">agenda to say you know what okay let the</text>
  <text start="781.82" dur="6.27">people in the country decide if this is</text>
  <text start="784.55" dur="5.76">what they want the US has to leave now</text>
  <text start="788.09" dur="5.04">because the Islamic state is completely</text>
  <text start="790.31" dur="4.35">done and I think this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="793.13" dur="3.36">trying to push and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="794.66" dur="3.12">trying to maneuver and of course the</text>
  <text start="796.49" dur="3.15">deep States not just going to step back</text>
  <text start="797.78" dur="4.8">and allow this to happen but we can see</text>
  <text start="799.64" dur="5.07">that something has changed now the</text>
  <text start="802.58" dur="3.42">Islamic state is being destroyed and I</text>
  <text start="804.71" dur="2.85">think we&amp;#39;re going to see this</text>
  <text start="806" dur="3.63">accelerated over the next couple of</text>
  <text start="807.56" dur="4.05">months and pretty soon we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="809.63" dur="5.46">hear that there&amp;#39;s very little terrorists</text>
  <text start="811.61" dur="6.03">left in Syria left in Iraq and many of</text>
  <text start="815.09" dur="6.72">the other countries which means the deep</text>
  <text start="817.64" dur="7.83">state is losing their army now we always</text>
  <text start="821.81" dur="6.12">knew going back in time that the deep</text>
  <text start="825.47" dur="6.12">state they will have some type of</text>
  <text start="827.93" dur="7.17">doomsday type of weapon event or</text>
  <text start="831.59" dur="7.35">something to basically change the course</text>
  <text start="835.1" dur="5.31">of where we&amp;#39;re headed and we sing from</text>
  <text start="838.94" dur="3.6">many different articles and many</text>
  <text start="840.41" dur="3.78">different reports that because of the</text>
  <text start="842.54" dur="4.8">Russian hacking which really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="844.19" dur="4.5">exist during the elections Obama said</text>
  <text start="847.34" dur="2.79">that he was going to do something at</text>
  <text start="848.69" dur="3.87">that point in time</text>
  <text start="850.13" dur="5.76">and there are reports that there was a</text>
  <text start="852.56" dur="6.81">secret order which had US intelligence</text>
  <text start="855.89" dur="5.58">designed and implant a series of cyber</text>
  <text start="859.37" dur="4.74">weapons into Russia&amp;#39;s infrastructure</text>
  <text start="861.47" dur="5.76">system with officials saying that they</text>
  <text start="864.11" dur="4.86">are meant to be activated remotely to</text>
  <text start="867.23" dur="4.59">hit the most important networks in</text>
  <text start="868.97" dur="5.91">Russia and are designed to cause them</text>
  <text start="871.82" dur="5.36">pain and discomfort now we know that</text>
  <text start="874.88" dur="5.64">Obama said he was going to do something</text>
  <text start="877.18" dur="4.96">we know that all the technology that is</text>
  <text start="880.52" dur="4.02">out there from Microsoft Google and all</text>
  <text start="882.14" dur="5.16">stuff already has things built in and we</text>
  <text start="884.54" dur="6.36">can see that this could be their</text>
  <text start="887.3" dur="6.06">last-ditch attempt to try to start a war</text>
  <text start="890.9" dur="4.2">where all of a sudden they hit their</text>
  <text start="893.36" dur="3.87">infrastructure we know they did it in</text>
  <text start="895.1" dur="5.49">Ukraine that was a test where they hit</text>
  <text start="897.23" dur="5.76">their power grid and we know that they</text>
  <text start="900.59" dur="3.84">might be trying this in Russia where</text>
  <text start="902.99" dur="3.9">they hit their financial institution</text>
  <text start="904.43" dur="4.62">where they hit their power grid their</text>
  <text start="906.89" dur="4.53">infrastructure and they try to bring</text>
  <text start="909.05" dur="5.91">Russia to their knees and hopefully</text>
  <text start="911.42" dur="6.12">Russia retaliates for this now this</text>
  <text start="914.96" dur="6.15">could be the big event or they could</text>
  <text start="917.54" dur="7.61">switch this around where they hit Russia</text>
  <text start="921.11" dur="7.59">but they also implanted cyber bombs</text>
  <text start="925.15" dur="6.67">inside the United States to say Russia</text>
  <text start="928.7" dur="5.19">then retaliated and hit us with their</text>
  <text start="931.82" dur="4.32">cyber bombs hit the financial</text>
  <text start="933.89" dur="5.13">institutions hit the power</text>
  <text start="936.14" dur="5.25">infrastructure because all they have to</text>
  <text start="939.02" dur="4.31">do is say this is what&amp;#39;s happening they</text>
  <text start="941.39" dur="5.13">have to show no proof whatsoever and</text>
  <text start="943.33" dur="5.2">then Trump would have to step in Putin</text>
  <text start="946.52" dur="4.41">would have to step in and we&amp;#39;d have to</text>
  <text start="948.53" dur="6.09">see where this actually goes so we can</text>
  <text start="950.93" dur="6.27">see this is going to be very very tricky</text>
  <text start="954.62" dur="4.86">as we move forward because we see both</text>
  <text start="957.2" dur="5.79">sides they are now pushing their agenda</text>
  <text start="959.48" dur="6.36">and they&amp;#39;re going to basically hit heads</text>
  <text start="962.99" dur="4.71">and we&amp;#39;re going to have to see how this</text>
  <text start="965.84" dur="4.47">all plays out but we can see each one</text>
  <text start="967.7" dur="5.43">has their plans and they&amp;#39;re battling it</text>
