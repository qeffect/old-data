  <text start="31.2" dur="4.83">economic collapses held together with</text>
  <text start="32.94" dur="6.71">tape and as we go through the report</text>
  <text start="36.03" dur="7.17">today we will see why everything is</text>
  <text start="39.65" dur="6.25">completely an illusion and the central</text>
  <text start="43.2" dur="6.5">bankers governments are trying to</text>
  <text start="45.9" dur="7.65">completely keep everything together for</text>
  <text start="49.7" dur="6.1">as long as they can and things are just</text>
  <text start="53.55" dur="3.96">crumbling and falling apart and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="55.8" dur="5.939">getting much much more difficult for</text>
  <text start="57.51" dur="6.06">them to keep everything together and we</text>
  <text start="61.739" dur="5.011">can see this around the world I mean I</text>
  <text start="63.57" dur="5.67">don&amp;#39;t look at what people say i look at</text>
  <text start="66.75" dur="5.28">actions of what&amp;#39;s going on in the world</text>
  <text start="69.24" dur="4.56">and that&amp;#39;s what I try to report on I</text>
  <text start="72.03" dur="4.14">mean sometimes you know we get things</text>
  <text start="73.8" dur="5.24">where people are saying things but</text>
  <text start="76.17" dur="5.4">actions do speak louder than words and</text>
  <text start="79.04" dur="3.85">it mean it&amp;#39;s almost like you know</text>
  <text start="81.57" dur="3.24">President Obama saying this is going to</text>
  <text start="82.89" dur="3.96">be the most transparent government ever</text>
  <text start="84.81" dur="5.21">and it seems like they&amp;#39;re having more</text>
  <text start="86.85" dur="6.48">secret meetings and more secrecy then</text>
  <text start="90.02" dur="6.04">you know than any other president so you</text>
  <text start="93.33" dur="4.92">know the actions of someone speaks much</text>
  <text start="96.06" dur="8.69">louder than what they tell you in front</text>
  <text start="98.25" dur="9.119">of you know right to your face now I</text>
  <text start="104.75" dur="5.83">added more things to the economic</text>
  <text start="107.369" dur="6.36">collapse timeline that is the tab on top</text>
  <text start="110.58" dur="6.12">when you come to the x 22 report site</text>
  <text start="113.729" dur="5.25">and it says economic collapse I added</text>
  <text start="116.7" dur="7.02">more things there and I&amp;#39;m trying to fill</text>
  <text start="118.979" dur="7.651">it in and create a story of the economic</text>
  <text start="123.72" dur="5.78">collapse so when we look at it we can</text>
  <text start="126.63" dur="6.3">see one thing leading into another and</text>
  <text start="129.5" dur="6.97">here is the outcome because when I was</text>
  <text start="132.93" dur="6.27">you know waking up I couldn&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="136.47" dur="5.37">things that that told the entire story</text>
  <text start="139.2" dur="3.96">you know looking from like the 10th</text>
  <text start="141.84" dur="3.81">floor of a building and looking down</text>
  <text start="143.16" dur="4.77">seeing the whole entire thing and seeing</text>
  <text start="145.65" dur="4.89">how it&amp;#39;s all put together and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="147.93" dur="5.22">what I&amp;#39;m trying to create here so when</text>
  <text start="150.54" dur="4.86">you look at it you can say oh I see all</text>
  <text start="153.15" dur="2.64">these little shootings led up to the</text>
  <text start="155.4" dur="2.52">sand</text>
  <text start="155.79" dur="6.509">hook shooting which led up to the gun</text>
  <text start="157.92" dur="6.87">confiscation or you know the all these</text>
  <text start="162.299" dur="7.92">laws the Patriot Act the NDAA the</text>
  <text start="164.79" dur="7.319">Miranda exception the the FDIC Bank Bank</text>
  <text start="170.219" dur="6.3">of England document and all these laws</text>
  <text start="172.109" dur="7.35">are leading up to a type of dictatorship</text>
  <text start="176.519" dur="6.87">martial law of trying to keep the people</text>
  <text start="179.459" dur="7.64">in controlled and you know we can see</text>
  <text start="183.389" dur="6.391">all this playing into each other and</text>
  <text start="187.099" dur="6.211">that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m trying to do I even put</text>
  <text start="189.78" dur="6.87">some of Ben Bernanke&amp;#39;s quotes back in</text>
  <text start="193.31" dur="6.609">2005-2006 because I wanted it I wanted</text>
  <text start="196.65" dur="5.429">to fill that in and have this story of</text>
  <text start="199.919" dur="4.77">how he was saying there was no economic</text>
  <text start="202.079" dur="5.701">collapse there was no housing bubble</text>
  <text start="204.689" dur="5.22">that the subprime was contained and and</text>
  <text start="207.78" dur="5.789">you know they&amp;#39;re not printing money</text>
  <text start="209.909" dur="5.341">we&amp;#39;re not monetizing the debt how did</text>
  <text start="213.569" dur="4.861">you know in the history of the country</text>
  <text start="215.25" dur="5.489">housing has never gone down so you know</text>
  <text start="218.43" dur="6.059">I&amp;#39;m trying to fill this in and make this</text>
  <text start="220.739" dur="5.43">into a story so when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="224.489" dur="4.261">can see what&amp;#39;s coming and it makes it a</text>
  <text start="226.169" dur="3.99">little bit easier for for everyone just</text>
  <text start="228.75" dur="3.349">to see the dates and stuff because</text>
  <text start="230.159" dur="4.771">things get lost and things like that</text>
  <text start="232.099" dur="4.42">over time and it seems like it sometimes</text>
  <text start="234.93" dur="3.449">it&amp;#39;s a little bit hard to find on the</text>
  <text start="236.519" dur="5.101">net because you know either people</text>
  <text start="238.379" dur="5.881">remove the links or change things but</text>
  <text start="241.62" dur="6.959">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="244.26" dur="7.649">news here a lots going on in the world</text>
  <text start="248.579" dur="8.791">and it was an article I believe it was a</text>
  <text start="251.909" dur="7.771">zero zero hedge JP volt drops JP Morgan</text>
  <text start="257.37" dur="5.25">volt drop gold drops by twenty eight</text>
  <text start="259.68" dur="4.769">point four percent overnight slides to</text>
  <text start="262.62" dur="4.229">fresh record low as withdrawals</text>
  <text start="264.449" dur="7.801">accelerate now why are people with</text>
  <text start="266.849" dur="7.951">drawing gold from the vault hmm maybe</text>
  <text start="272.25" dur="5.849">they realize that this is real money and</text>
  <text start="274.8" dur="5.73">they want to hold the physical gold</text>
  <text start="278.099" dur="4.921">before it&amp;#39;s all gone plus the paper</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="5.109">contracts are probably coming too and</text>
  <text start="283.02" dur="5.53">they need to deliver this gold</text>
  <text start="285.639" dur="4.471">and people want physical they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="288.55" dur="7.04">to hold on to this paper because they</text>
  <text start="290.11" dur="9.66">know what&amp;#39;s coming now goldman sachs is</text>
  <text start="295.59" dur="8.169">predicting a bond crash now max keiser</text>
  <text start="299.77" dur="7.739">back in December of 2012 I believe also</text>
  <text start="303.759" dur="7.47">said around the springtime there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="307.509" dur="6.72">to be a bond crash and now Goldman Sachs</text>
  <text start="311.229" dur="6.99">is out there saying that there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="314.229" dur="6.631">to be a bond crash and you know they</text>
  <text start="318.219" dur="6.391">told us that there that they were</text>
  <text start="320.86" dur="6.059">bearish on gold and a week later the</text>
  <text start="324.61" dur="5.549">government came down and smacked down</text>
  <text start="326.919" dur="7.02">gold and brought it you know into the</text>
  <text start="330.159" dur="7.37">1300s and that&amp;#39;s where it has stayed</text>
  <text start="333.939" dur="6.331">sins and every time it tries to go above</text>
  <text start="337.529" dur="7.51">1400 it is pushed down I mean gold is up</text>
  <text start="340.27" dur="8.03">today but it has not reached above 1400</text>
  <text start="345.039" dur="7.261">and you know you can see this pattern</text>
  <text start="348.3" dur="6.839">each time this happens now the markets</text>
  <text start="352.3" dur="7.109">are down all you know in Asia in Europe</text>
  <text start="355.139" dur="7.12">and also here in America and you know</text>
  <text start="359.409" dur="5.73">there&amp;#39;s it seems like if they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="362.259" dur="7.261">a tough time keeping these markets</text>
  <text start="365.139" dur="6.27">propped up so we might hear the Federal</text>
  <text start="369.52" dur="4.59">Reserve saying that they they need to</text>
  <text start="371.409" dur="7.53">print some more money if they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="374.11" dur="13.769">control what is going on here but you</text>
  <text start="378.939" dur="12.35">know the since Goldman Sachs is</text>
  <text start="387.879" dur="6">predicting this and they already know</text>
  <text start="391.289" dur="5.11">that the bond market is going to</text>
  <text start="393.879" dur="6.391">collapse because we&amp;#39;re seeing the yields</text>
  <text start="396.399" dur="11.67">and bomb bonds starting to rise things</text>
  <text start="400.27" dur="10.019">are becoming a unstable and there&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="408.069" dur="5.13">one reason they&amp;#39;re predicting this is</text>
  <text start="410.289" dur="5.19">because they already know just like a</text>
  <text start="413.199" dur="4.08">week in advance they do that gold there</text>
  <text start="415.479" dur="3.221">they&amp;#39;re predicting bearish on gold and</text>
  <text start="417.279" dur="5.221">then as soon as the smack</text>
  <text start="418.7" dur="6.45">happen they weren&amp;#39;t bearish anymore so</text>
  <text start="422.5" dur="5.32">we need to look at this and also other</text>
  <text start="425.15" dur="4.86">people said uh you know sometime in the</text>
  <text start="427.82" dur="6.3">spring and they I mean again when people</text>
  <text start="430.01" dur="7.11">say in the spring you know they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="434.12" dur="5.49">know a specific time frame so it could</text>
  <text start="437.12" dur="5.58">be spring early summer we don&amp;#39;t know for</text>
  <text start="439.61" dur="5.28">sure but we know by looking at</text>
  <text start="442.7" dur="4.26">everything there is some type of time</text>
  <text start="444.89" dur="7.53">frame just like yesterday I did the</text>
  <text start="446.96" dur="8.64">report on an event which doug had doug</text>
  <text start="452.42" dur="7.79">hagmann from his d h insider reported</text>

  <text start="907.93" dur="6.93">pretty much cover everything up well</text>
  <text start="910.93" dur="6.63">they do one or two things they change</text>
  <text start="914.86" dur="5.789">calculations like we saw they did with</text>
  <text start="917.56" dur="4.769">unemployment inflation and GDP and X</text>
  <text start="920.649" dur="4.5">wired on the people brought this to my</text>
  <text start="922.329" dur="4.291">attention instead of you know they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="925.149" dur="3.3">change the calculations on unemployment</text>
  <text start="926.62" dur="3.87">anymore because what are they going to</text>
  <text start="928.449" dur="5.76">do there they&amp;#39;re going to count they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="930.49" dur="5.88">there they&amp;#39;re just going to not count</text>
  <text start="934.209" dur="4.771">the unemployed anymore and say that the</text>
  <text start="936.37" dur="5.88">employment is is going down I mean it</text>
  <text start="938.98" dur="6.63">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s nothing left so they</text>
  <text start="942.25" dur="5.49">they switch and what they were gauging</text>
  <text start="945.61" dur="4.26">everything on they switch instead of a</text>

  <text start="950.57" dur="5.79">a number of new jobs needed every month</text>
  <text start="953.09" dur="8.01">what they do this&amp;#39;ll just lower that</text>
  <text start="956.36" dur="6.81">number okay now we only need 80,000 now</text>
  <text start="961.1" dur="4.86">the central bank researchers in fact say</text>
  <text start="963.17" dur="5.25">that because of various factors the</text>
  <text start="965.96" dur="4.83">number now will be closer to 80,000 and</text>
  <text start="968.42" dur="6.33">this will go down as time goes on</text>
  <text start="970.79" dur="7.28">because let&amp;#39;s use logic here nobody can</text>
  <text start="974.75" dur="5.91">find work so if nobody can find work</text>
  <text start="978.07" dur="6.37">that a hundred and fifty thousand that</text>
  <text start="980.66" dur="6.27">they needed it&amp;#39;s not going to happen and</text>
  <text start="984.44" dur="4.05">the unemployment is not going to go down</text>
  <text start="986.93" dur="3.06">and start going to it&amp;#39;s going to start</text>
  <text start="988.49" dur="5.16">creeping up but they got to keep</text>
  <text start="989.99" dur="5.13">everyone asleep so what do they do well</text>
  <text start="993.65" dur="3.72">they can&amp;#39;t change the calculation on</text>
  <text start="995.12" dur="4.32">unemployment so let&amp;#39;s just you know</text>
  <text start="997.37" dur="3.81">let&amp;#39;s just make what we have to hit the</text>
  <text start="999.44" dur="5">target number that we have to hit lower</text>
  <text start="1001.18" dur="7.26">that&amp;#39;s easy it&amp;#39;s almost like someone</text>

  <text start="1071.14" dur="8.55">what what&amp;#39;s creeping up behind all of</text>
  <text start="1075.4" dur="7.46">this is the collapse what&amp;#39;s creeping up</text>
  <text start="1079.69" dur="9.109">behind all this is the truth</text>

  <text start="1088.799" dur="4.711">don&amp;#39;t want you to see it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="1091.049" dur="4.201">The Wizard of Oz there behind the</text>

  <text start="1105.33" dur="3.599">mainstream media and everyone&amp;#39;s were</text>
  <text start="1106.799" dur="4.621">always reporting on Cyprus which that</text>
  <text start="1108.929" dur="5.88">that&amp;#39;s there not because you know they</text>
  <text start="1111.42" dur="7.92">kind of forgot about Cyprus but if you</text>
  <text start="1114.809" dur="7.5">remember back in March when the whole</text>
  <text start="1119.34" dur="4.02">thing started to fall apart and they</text>
  <text start="1122.309" dur="3.661">said they were going to put capital</text>
  <text start="1123.36" dur="3.66">controls in for two weeks and they said</text>
  <text start="1125.97" dur="2.79">they&amp;#39;re going to extend it a week and</text>
  <text start="1127.02" dur="4.1">then basically never heard anything</text>
  <text start="1128.76" dur="10.52">anymore they just kind of dropped it</text>
  <text start="1131.12" dur="10.689">well the president nicos is of Cyprus is</text>
  <text start="1139.28" dur="4.8">asking the international lenders to</text>
  <text start="1141.809" dur="5.161">urgently lift controls on banks</text>

  <text start="1149.79" dur="3.42">were introduced with the aim of</text>
  <text start="1150.9" dur="3.6">preventing a run on the banks after the</text>

  <text start="1161.79" dur="5.94">news goes all the bank runs weren&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="1164.16" dur="5.7">bad look everything&amp;#39;s okay people are</text>
  <text start="1167.73" dur="5.04">keeping their money in the bank yeah but</text>
  <text start="1169.86" dur="6.51">they forgot to tell you that the capital</text>
  <text start="1172.77" dur="5.64">controls are still in effect what month</text>
  <text start="1176.37" dur="8.07">are we in now we&amp;#39;re in the middle of</text>
  <text start="1178.41" dur="13.04">June and they&amp;#39;re still in the same</text>
  <text start="1184.44" dur="10.59">position so what&amp;#39;s changed nothing and</text>
  <text start="1191.45" dur="5.8">pretty much it just fell to the side no</text>
  <text start="1195.03" dur="3.87">one knows anything about it they still</text>
  <text start="1197.25" dur="4.86">have capital controls because put it</text>
  <text start="1198.9" dur="5.61">this way if they lifted those capital</text>
  <text start="1202.11" dur="4.97">controls after two three four weeks even</text>
  <text start="1204.51" dur="6.27">today what do you think would happen</text>
  <text start="1207.08" dur="6.729">they&amp;#39;d be a bank run and if there was a</text>
  <text start="1210.78" dur="5.01">bank run it would be all over the place</text>
  <text start="1213.809" dur="2.411">and people would be going what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1215.79" dur="1.81">getting</text>
  <text start="1216.22" dur="3.66">any of the bank well we need to do the</text>
  <text start="1217.6" dur="5.699">same thing we need to get our money out</text>
  <text start="1219.88" dur="6.179">of the bank right now instead you keep</text>
  <text start="1223.299" dur="4.801">the capital controls nobody knows</text>
  <text start="1226.059" dur="4.98">anything because there is no bank run</text>
  <text start="1228.1" dur="6.87">and the capital controls have been kept</text>
  <text start="1231.039" dur="7.971">in place since March but nobody tells</text>
  <text start="1234.97" dur="8.55">you this all right let&amp;#39;s move on here</text>
  <text start="1239.01" dur="8.86">now Syria troops preparing for this</text>
  <text start="1243.52" dur="8.19">pronounces Aleppo assault and it looks</text>
  <text start="1247.87" dur="5.34">like that the Syrian rebel forces which</text>
  <text start="1251.71" dur="5.579">are losing which are funded by the</text>
  <text start="1253.21" dur="6.24">United States and back by the CIA which</text>
  <text start="1257.289" dur="5.421">are a bunch of mercenaries trying to</text>
  <text start="1259.45" dur="6.599">overthrow Assad or losing the battle and</text>
  <text start="1262.71" dur="10.02">Assad is winning and basically they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1266.049" dur="12.99">going to try this last attempt of</text>
  <text start="1272.73" dur="9.16">pushing this war forward and basically</text>
  <text start="1279.039" dur="6.901">that&amp;#39;s the operation northern storm and</text>
  <text start="1281.89" dur="8.51">if this doesn&amp;#39;t work which it probably</text>
  <text start="1285.94" dur="8.19">will not what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="1290.4" dur="7.509">they&amp;#39;re going to make a case of why we</text>
  <text start="1294.13" dur="6.21">need to go into Syria and actually start</text>
  <text start="1297.909" dur="3.931">a war and the only way to do this</text>
  <text start="1300.34" dur="4.77">because right now the American people</text>
  <text start="1301.84" dur="5.19">are not really into this at all they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1305.11" dur="4.319">not even paying attention so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1307.03" dur="5.61">going to have to snap everyone out of</text>
  <text start="1309.429" dur="7.13">this and make them pay attention and the</text>
  <text start="1312.64" dur="7.289">only way to do this is with an event</text>
  <text start="1316.559" dur="6.781">something that will hit home something</text>
  <text start="1319.929" dur="8.011">that will shock the people to say hey</text>
  <text start="1323.34" dur="7.329">look what Syria just did over here look</text>
  <text start="1327.94" dur="5.91">what Iran just did over here which is</text>
  <text start="1330.669" dur="5.581">connected to Syria they just released</text>
  <text start="1333.85" dur="5.79">deadly chemicals in the New York City</text>
  <text start="1336.25" dur="5.299">subway system you know during the same</text>
  <text start="1339.64" dur="6.57">time they&amp;#39;re having a drill in July and</text>
  <text start="1341.549" dur="7.931">they killed and hurt many people and it</text>
  <text start="1346.21" dur="9.61">was the al-qaeda</text>
  <text start="1349.48" dur="9.16">faction from Syria and we need to go in</text>
  <text start="1355.82" dur="5.52">there because this is an act of war and</text>
  <text start="1358.64" dur="7.23">they&amp;#39;re going to do something if this</text>
  <text start="1361.34" dur="8.01">northern the operation northern storm</text>
  <text start="1365.87" dur="6.27">does not work and it probably will not</text>
  <text start="1369.35" dur="6.02">so we have a lot of things going to</text>
  <text start="1372.14" dur="6.69">happen in the next couple of months so</text>
  <text start="1375.37" dur="5.44">you know just be informed now when up</text>
  <text start="1378.83" dur="5.01">might not be the new york city but I</text>
  <text start="1380.81" dur="7.23">mean that seems you know right in pace</text>
  <text start="1383.84" dur="6.89">but it could be there&amp;#39;s also a national</text>
  <text start="1388.04" dur="5.4">scat scout jamboree happening in July so</text>
  <text start="1390.73" dur="5.71">you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of potential here</text>
  <text start="1393.44" dur="4.23">for something to happen and there are</text>

  <text start="1880.95" dur="6.18">I don&amp;#39;t care what anyone says was a</text>
  <text start="1883.769" dur="7.591">complete test to see if they could do it</text>
  <text start="1887.13" dur="10.049">and it was done they were able to bring</text>
  <text start="1891.36" dur="10.83">down the entire grid now they are going</text>
  <text start="1897.179" dur="10.321">to do this and this report right here is</text>
  <text start="1902.19" dur="7.949">to show that what will happen when the</text>

  <text start="1912.779" dur="3.63">if they want to blame it on that fine</text>

  <text start="1923.159" dur="5.041">what will happen how the people react</text>
  <text start="1926.25" dur="3.57">and they wanted to see what in 2003 what</text>
  <text start="1928.2" dur="3.959">would happen in two days because</text>
  <text start="1929.82" dur="4.56">basically the de Scott was and I</text>
  <text start="1932.159" dur="5.4">was in that was knocked out for two days</text>

  <text start="1937.559" dur="4.11">much people were you know they they they</text>
  <text start="1940.139" dur="2.91">kind of figured that the lights would</text>
  <text start="1941.669" dur="3.99">come back on and everything would be</text>
  <text start="1943.049" dur="6.031">okay and I was in Manhattan at the time</text>
  <text start="1945.659" dur="5.671">and basically restaurants had to get rid</text>

  <text start="1964.919" dur="6.211">I didn&amp;#39;t see anything going on and</text>
  <text start="1967.32" dur="6.959">anything going wrong but after those two</text>

  <text start="2131.96" dur="5.76">doesn&amp;#39;t make logical sense that if it</text>
  <text start="2134.45" dur="6.329">was a solar storm or some type of storm</text>
  <text start="2137.72" dur="5.91">why only the East Coast why not the</text>

  <text start="2143.63" dur="4.35">just the southern stage we&amp;#39;re just the</text>
  <text start="2146.569" dur="4.531">northern states</text>

  <text start="2151.1" dur="7.25">what&amp;#39;s going to happen this will happen</text>
  <text start="2154.46" dur="9.23">and the power will be knocked out</text>
  <text start="2158.35" dur="8.65">because they know this is their home run</text>
  <text start="2163.69" dur="7.11">to cover up what is coming if they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2167" dur="9.359">do it by other false flags and basically</text>
  <text start="2170.8" dur="7.78">I&amp;#39;ve been telling people that we need to</text>
  <text start="2176.359" dur="7.381">get prepared not just with gold and</text>
