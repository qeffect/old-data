  <text start="112.929" dur="3.961">economic collapse financial news you</text>
  <text start="115.299" dur="5.31">know as we know Q has been telling us</text>
  <text start="116.89" dur="6.179">that gold is going to bring down the</text>
  <text start="120.609" dur="5.4">Federal Reserve gold is going to bring</text>
  <text start="123.069" dur="5.731">down the central bank and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="126.009" dur="6.181">to see evidence of this because the</text>
  <text start="128.8" dur="4.92">central banks right now they are worried</text>
  <text start="132.19" dur="2.94">I&amp;#39;m going to be talking about that in</text>
  <text start="133.72" dur="4.05">just a minute but first let&amp;#39;s start off</text>
  <text start="135.13" dur="4.95">with the January payroll numbers and</text>
  <text start="137.77" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s all over the news saying that the</text>
  <text start="140.08" dur="4.71">January payroll numbers soared by three</text>
  <text start="142" dur="6.36">hundred four thousand this is the record</text>
  <text start="144.79" dur="5.55">100th consecutive month of job gains now</text>
  <text start="148.36" dur="4.98">again we need to remember something very</text>
  <text start="150.34" dur="6.54">very important here Trump is using the</text>
  <text start="153.34" dur="7.23">same exact manipulation calculations</text>
  <text start="156.88" dur="6.57">that have been used by Obama and going</text>
  <text start="160.57" dur="4.29">back before him he&amp;#39;s using the central</text>
  <text start="163.45" dur="4.11">bank the deep state weapons</text>
  <text start="164.86" dur="4.92">against themselves because when we</text>
  <text start="167.56" dur="5.85">really look at these numbers what does</text>
  <text start="169.78" dur="6.96">it tell us it tells us that the job</text>
  <text start="173.41" dur="5.48">growth is unbelievable now yes this is</text>
  <text start="176.74" dur="5.43">what&amp;#39;s being reported out to the public</text>
  <text start="178.89" dur="5.56">to show everyone the economy is getting</text>
  <text start="182.17" dur="4.68">strong Trump needs to do this he has to</text>
  <text start="184.45" dur="4.47">do this because the deep state was going</text>
  <text start="186.85" dur="4.83">to try to use a failing economy against</text>
  <text start="188.92" dur="4.5">him he turned the tables on them but if</text>
  <text start="191.68" dur="3.81">we actually look at the numbers what do</text>
  <text start="193.42" dur="4.56">we see well we see something very</text>
  <text start="195.49" dur="5.219">strange we see that the numbers were</text>
  <text start="197.98" dur="4.59">revised in December and it revised lower</text>
  <text start="200.709" dur="3.661">from three hundred and twelve thousand</text>
  <text start="202.57" dur="4.23">to two hundred and twenty two thousand</text>
  <text start="204.37" dur="5.82">which made it look like jobs were</text>
  <text start="206.8" dur="5.22">booming in the month of January so</text>
  <text start="210.19" dur="4.019">they&amp;#39;re playing with numbers the</text>
  <text start="212.02" dur="3.78">unemployment rate went from four percent</text>
  <text start="214.209" dur="3.931">I mean from three point nine percent to</text>
  <text start="215.8" dur="4.56">four percent and we can see at this</text>
  <text start="218.14" dur="4.62">point that Trump is using the same</text>
  <text start="220.36" dur="4.5">tactics that the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="222.76" dur="5.37">bankers have been using before he has to</text>
  <text start="224.86" dur="5.61">do this because otherwise if he just</text>
  <text start="228.13" dur="4.02">lets the economy fail and he corrects</text>
  <text start="230.47" dur="3.329">all the calculations the mainstream</text>
  <text start="232.15" dur="4.559">media the deep state they&amp;#39;d be all over</text>
  <text start="233.799" dur="4.861">him and they would blame him for the</text>
  <text start="236.709" dur="4.891">economy falling apart and this is not</text>
  <text start="238.66" dur="6.87">part of the plan he&amp;#39;s doing this keeping</text>
  <text start="241.6" dur="6.99">the illusion alive to work on the other</text>
  <text start="245.53" dur="4.38">parts of the plan that is getting rid of</text>
  <text start="248.59" dur="4.5">the central bank getting with a deep</text>
  <text start="249.91" dur="5.28">state and resetting the entire country</text>
  <text start="253.09" dur="3.69">and then eventually the world will be</text>
  <text start="255.19" dur="3.66">reset which we can say it&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="256.78" dur="4.679">already we see the labor participation</text>
  <text start="258.85" dur="4.56">rate it hit sixty three point two this</text>
  <text start="261.459" dur="4.141">is the highest level since March 2014 as</text>
  <text start="263.41" dur="4.56">more people jump back into the labor</text>
  <text start="265.6" dur="6.99">force where are they going they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="267.97" dur="6.03">to the manufacturing jobs BLS also notes</text>
  <text start="272.59" dur="5.19">that the number of persons employed</text>
  <text start="274" dur="6.99">part-time for economic reasons increased</text>
  <text start="277.78" dur="5.57">by about one-and-a-half million to five</text>
  <text start="280.99" dur="5.82">point million in January because</text>
  <text start="283.35" dur="5.68">basically our economy is made up of a</text>
  <text start="286.81" dur="4.41">lot of part-time jobs many people have</text>
  <text start="289.03" dur="4.05">one to three part-time jobs and remember</text>
  <text start="291.22" dur="3.9">how they are counted if you have a</text>
  <text start="293.08" dur="4.35">part-time job it is counted as a</text>
  <text start="295.12" dur="3.56">full-time job so we know that these</text>
  <text start="297.43" dur="3.38">numbers are manipulated but</text>
  <text start="298.68" dur="6.329">being manipulated on purpose right now</text>
  <text start="300.81" dur="7.639">to reset the entire system we see us</text>
  <text start="305.009" dur="6.961">manufacturing that has rebounded in</text>
  <text start="308.449" dur="5.711">January while European Japanese and</text>
  <text start="311.97" dur="4.38">Chinese manufacturing jobs they are</text>
  <text start="314.16" dur="6.24">plunging right now and the question is</text>
  <text start="316.35" dur="6.75">why throughout Europe Japan China why is</text>
  <text start="320.4" dur="6.51">manufacturing plunging there well we</text>
  <text start="323.1" dur="6.539">know they are in an economic illusion</text>
  <text start="326.91" dur="5.97">the difference is we can manipulate</text>
  <text start="329.639" dur="5.491">everything the European Union with all</text>
  <text start="332.88" dur="4.11">the different countries they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="335.13" dur="4.379">a printing press they have to go to the</text>
  <text start="336.99" dur="4.17">ECB they have to borrow money so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="339.509" dur="5.16">getting hit hard because they</text>
  <text start="341.16" dur="5.49">continually borrow and there&amp;#39;s austerity</text>
  <text start="344.669" dur="4.051">placed on a lot of these countries and a</text>
  <text start="346.65" dur="5.07">lot of jobs well a lot of people are out</text>
  <text start="348.72" dur="4.56">of these jobs same thing in China it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="351.72" dur="3.03">happening there here in the United</text>
  <text start="353.28" dur="4.29">States we&amp;#39;ve lost millions and millions</text>
  <text start="354.75" dur="4.38">of jobs but if we get 20 30 40 thousand</text>
  <text start="357.57" dur="4.89">jobs back here it looks like</text>
  <text start="359.13" dur="5.039">manufacturing is surging and Trump he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="362.46" dur="4.679">trying to bring his bet as much back as</text>
  <text start="364.169" dur="4.761">possible now very something very</text>
  <text start="367.139" dur="6.051">interesting and we can see that</text>
  <text start="368.93" dur="6.94">countries they are losing faith in</text>
  <text start="373.19" dur="5.02">Treasuries they&amp;#39;re losing faith in the</text>
  <text start="375.87" dur="4.74">dollar and we need to remember something</text>
  <text start="378.21" dur="5.429">very very important this is a central</text>
  <text start="380.61" dur="6.089">bank system it&amp;#39;s the central bank dollar</text>
  <text start="383.639" dur="5.31">the Treasuries were part of the central</text>
  <text start="386.699" dur="5.101">bank plan and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="388.949" dur="5.611">now is that China Japan other entities</text>
  <text start="391.8" dur="6">they have dumped US Treasuries they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="394.56" dur="6.599">going to protect themselves now they</text>
  <text start="397.8" dur="5.19">have dumped quite a bit and I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="401.159" dur="6.57">about China Japan and many many other</text>
  <text start="402.99" dur="8.37">countries if they are dumping who is</text>
  <text start="407.729" dur="6.601">purchasing well when we look closely at</text>
  <text start="411.36" dur="5.489">this we see and we know who is</text>
  <text start="414.33" dur="6.209">purchasing but when we look we can see</text>
  <text start="416.849" dur="6.57">that foreign investors combine slashed</text>
  <text start="420.539" dur="4.56">their holdings of marketable Treasury</text>
  <text start="423.419" dur="3.781">securities in November by a hundred and</text>
  <text start="425.099" dur="6.18">five billion from November a year</text>
  <text start="427.2" dur="5.04">earlier to 6.2 trillion now the private</text>
  <text start="431.279" dur="3.121">sector</text>
  <text start="432.24" dur="4.649">and this is the foreign hedge funds</text>
  <text start="434.4" dur="5.579">banks individuals they increase their</text>
  <text start="436.889" dur="5.31">holdings by 52 billion to 2.3 trillion</text>
  <text start="439.979" dur="4.231">now the two largest foreign creditors of</text>
  <text start="442.199" dur="5.011">the US China and Japan they have both</text>
  <text start="444.21" dur="5.1">unloaded their Treasury securities</text>
  <text start="447.21" dur="4.65">China&amp;#39;s holding fell by 55 billion from</text>
  <text start="449.31" dur="6.18">a year earlier and Japan&amp;#39;s holding fell</text>
  <text start="451.86" dur="5.01">by 47 billion from a year earlier so</text>
  <text start="455.49" dur="3.57">over the 12-month period through</text>
  <text start="456.87" dur="3.72">November 30th this debt rose by one</text>
  <text start="459.06" dur="3.539">point to six trillion to twenty one</text>
  <text start="460.59" dur="5.009">point nine trillion these are the</text>
  <text start="462.599" dur="8.85">entities who were net buyers or net</text>
  <text start="465.599" dur="8.13">sellers foreign holders net sellers shed</text>
  <text start="471.449" dur="5.611">a hundred and five billion Federal</text>
  <text start="473.729" dur="6.03">Reserve net seller shed two hundred and</text>
  <text start="477.06" dur="5.57">four billion u.s. government entities</text>
  <text start="479.759" dur="6.9">pension funds social security net buyers</text>
  <text start="482.63" dur="7.42">increase holdings by twenty billion how</text>
  <text start="486.659" dur="5.16">about the rest well American banks hedge</text>
  <text start="490.05" dur="6.48">funds pension funds mutual funds and</text>
  <text start="491.819" dur="7.47">other institutions so basically the</text>
  <text start="496.53" dur="4.74">United States pension fund they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="499.289" dur="5.85">buying all the Treasuries banks are</text>
  <text start="501.27" dur="5.399">buying the Treasuries the Fed doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="505.139" dur="5">even want to hold on to the Treasuries</text>
  <text start="506.669" dur="7.081">so it looks like institutions people</text>
  <text start="510.139" dur="6.791">investments they&amp;#39;re taking on the debt</text>
  <text start="513.75" dur="6.99">now if every go ever if everything goes</text>
  <text start="516.93" dur="7.71">south and the people are holding the</text>
  <text start="520.74" dur="6.12">debt and investments are holding the</text>
  <text start="524.64" dur="3.84">debt we might be in a little bit of</text>
  <text start="526.86" dur="3.719">trouble here and we can see that</text>
  <text start="528.48" dur="5.4">countries right now they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="530.579" dur="6.421">separate themselves from the central</text>
  <text start="533.88" dur="7.86">bank system and that is the Federal</text>
  <text start="537" dur="5.57">Reserve with the US dollar now we know</text>
  <text start="541.74" dur="4.26">what&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="542.57" dur="5.709">q has been telling us that the Fed is</text>
  <text start="546" dur="5.61">going to be brought down by gold and I</text>
  <text start="548.279" dur="5.461">remember going back in time with Ron</text>
  <text start="551.61" dur="4.5">Paul and Bernanke when Ron Paul was</text>
  <text start="553.74" dur="4.77">asking Bernanke about gold and Bernanke</text>
  <text start="556.11" dur="4.38">says we yeah you know just as something</text>
  <text start="558.51" dur="3.569">that we do we just hold gold but it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="560.49" dur="3.539">barbarous relic it&amp;#39;s not really money</text>
  <text start="562.079" dur="4.631">you know it&amp;#39;s really not anything we</text>
  <text start="564.029" dur="5.141">just hold it for sentimental reasons</text>
  <text start="566.71" dur="4.05">and of course Ron Paul is like yeah</text>
  <text start="569.17" dur="3.42">that&amp;#39;s not why you hold gold you hold</text>
  <text start="570.76" dur="3.45">gold because it&amp;#39;s real money but of</text>
  <text start="572.59" dur="4.74">course the central banks they like to</text>
  <text start="574.21" dur="5.97">play this down and we know that q said</text>
  <text start="577.33" dur="5.7">that gold is going to bring down the Fed</text>
  <text start="580.18" dur="5.34">which is the central bank and gold is</text>
  <text start="583.03" dur="5.01">poised to close out January with a</text>
  <text start="585.52" dur="5.79">fourth straight monthly gain and Raul</text>

  <text start="594.73" dur="6.87">cycle they always end up cutting each</text>
  <text start="599.35" dur="6.06">cutting cycle has led to a recession</text>
  <text start="601.6" dur="5.88">except in mid 90s and 1987 odds are in</text>
  <text start="605.41" dur="4.47">favor of the Fed having gone too far</text>
  <text start="607.48" dur="3.9">already and the stock market figuring it</text>
  <text start="609.88" dur="3.87">out in due course</text>
  <text start="611.38" dur="4.47">now remember Trump has been telling the</text>
  <text start="613.75" dur="4.5">Fed to hold off on the interest rate</text>
  <text start="615.85" dur="4.5">hikes q has been telling us they already</text>

  <text start="673.75" dur="3.02">be their reasoning</text>
  <text start="676.85" dur="6.959">because they know their paper system is</text>
  <text start="682.179" dur="5.291">falling apart</text>
  <text start="683.809" dur="5.7">I mean if Bernanke&amp;#39;s argument was</text>
  <text start="687.47" dur="4.679">correct the central banks would have</text>
  <text start="689.509" dur="5.13">nothing to do with gold they wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="692.149" dur="7.89">want it they would believe in their</text>
  <text start="694.639" dur="8.28">paper currency but they know that gold</text>
  <text start="700.039" dur="5.01">is real money what are they doing</text>
  <text start="702.919" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re setting up their insurance</text>
  <text start="705.049" dur="6.93">policy they know what is happening they</text>
  <text start="708.829" dur="4.44">know if they are destroyed they need</text>
  <text start="711.979" dur="4.01">something there so what are they doing</text>
  <text start="713.269" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;re trading in the paper that they</text>
  <text start="715.989" dur="6.04">create out of thin air and they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="719.449" dur="5.401">it to purchase gold now let&amp;#39;s back up</text>
  <text start="722.029" dur="6.45">for a second why do you think they</text>
  <text start="724.85" dur="6.569">suppress gold and silver all these years</text>
  <text start="728.479" dur="4.95">I mean because we know that this is not</text>
  <text start="731.419" dur="4.83">the real gold and silver price if the</text>
  <text start="733.429" dur="5.43">dollar has lost its value like 99</text>
  <text start="736.249" dur="4.26">percent of its value this is why we see</text>
  <text start="738.859" dur="4.2">inflation because it means it takes a</text>
  <text start="740.509" dur="6.42">lot more dollars to buy that same exact</text>
  <text start="743.059" dur="5.911">object now why would they do this now</text>
  <text start="746.929" dur="5.73">they&amp;#39;ve done it for a very long time to</text>
  <text start="748.97" dur="5.819">protect their system why would they</text>
  <text start="752.659" dur="4.5">continue to do it because they knew</text>
  <text start="754.789" dur="5.1">eventually they were going to have to</text>
  <text start="757.159" dur="4.86">use their paper currency and they would</text>
  <text start="759.889" dur="4.65">have to purchase gold and why not</text>
  <text start="762.019" dur="6.72">purchase it when it&amp;#39;s really really</text>
  <text start="764.539" dur="6.3">cheap they&amp;#39;re preparing for what is</text>
  <text start="768.739" dur="4.111">about to happen remember we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="770.839" dur="3.99">articles of the central bank worried</text>
  <text start="772.85" dur="4.229">about their independence they&amp;#39;re worried</text>
  <text start="774.829" dur="4.41">about the next crisis they&amp;#39;re worried</text>
  <text start="777.079" dur="4.021">about the Federal Reserve not coming to</text>
  <text start="779.239" dur="6.09">help the other central banks because of</text>
  <text start="781.1" dur="5.699">political circumstances the reason why</text>
  <text start="785.329" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re out there saying all this</text>
  <text start="786.799" dur="6.75">because they realize there is change</text>
  <text start="788.989" dur="7.38">right now change is in the wind and when</text>
  <text start="793.549" dur="6.39">you look you can see that central banks</text>
  <text start="796.369" dur="8.51">around the world the European Central</text>
  <text start="799.939" dur="8.461">Bank&amp;#39;s Russia Kazakhstan Turkey hungry</text>
  <text start="804.879" dur="7.421">India Iraq</text>
  <text start="808.4" dur="6.65">and many many others are all purchasing</text>
  <text start="812.3" dur="5.94">gold how about the Federal Reserve I</text>
  <text start="815.05" dur="7.6">haven&amp;#39;t heard anything which tells you</text>
  <text start="818.24" dur="7.2">something which tells you that gold will</text>
  <text start="822.65" dur="4.74">be able to bring down the Fed now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="825.44" dur="4.92">very interesting we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="827.39" dur="5.87">gold rise and they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="830.36" dur="6.93">because of what Powell is doing because</text>

  <text start="837.29" dur="4.98">saying that they&amp;#39;re gonna pause right</text>
  <text start="839.45" dur="5.07">now now think about the entire plan</text>
  <text start="842.27" dur="7.17">if gold was going to bring down the Fed</text>
  <text start="844.52" dur="7.74">Gold would have to rise countries would</text>
