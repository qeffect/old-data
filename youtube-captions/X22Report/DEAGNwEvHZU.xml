  <text start="53.08" dur="3.84">run for stocks but recently the market</text>
  <text start="55.09" dur="4.02">has started to topple the big question</text>
  <text start="56.92" dur="4.23">is how far will the market fall and</text>
  <text start="59.11" dur="3.18">during this time noble gold they have</text>
  <text start="61.15" dur="3.18">been getting their clients to buy</text>

  <text start="82.03" dur="4.17">like the Patriots have done it again and</text>
  <text start="84.4" dur="4.41">everything that&amp;#39;s happening right on</text>
  <text start="86.2" dur="5.099">schedule what do I mean by this well we</text>
  <text start="88.81" dur="4.32">know that Trump and those individuals</text>
  <text start="91.299" dur="3.841">behind him working towards getting rid</text>
  <text start="93.13" dur="3.809">of the central bank they want the</text>
  <text start="95.14" dur="3.78">central bank to do certain things then</text>
  <text start="96.939" dur="3.72">remember they just can&amp;#39;t come out and</text>
  <text start="98.92" dur="3.449">say listen you need to do this and then</text>
  <text start="100.659" dur="4.111">the central bank goes ahead and does it</text>
  <text start="102.369" dur="5.911">because the central bank will not look</text>
  <text start="104.77" dur="5.4">independent this is part of the plan to</text>
  <text start="108.28" dur="3.689">continually make it look like the</text>
  <text start="110.17" dur="4.229">Federal Reserve is completely</text>
  <text start="111.969" dur="4.231">independent and Trump has no control</text>
  <text start="114.399" dur="4.25">over the Federal Reserve they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="116.2" dur="5.699">their own decisions on their own and</text>
  <text start="118.649" dur="5.5">this has to be this way to keep the</text>
  <text start="121.899" dur="4.65">mainstream media those bad people in the</text>
  <text start="124.149" dur="5.161">central bank off the back of the</text>
  <text start="126.549" dur="4.38">Patriots and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="129.31" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re doing this is part of the plan</text>
  <text start="130.929" dur="5.281">and we&amp;#39;re going to be talking about how</text>
  <text start="132.85" dur="4.71">much control the Patriots now have a</text>
  <text start="136.21" dur="3.63">little bit later in this report but</text>
  <text start="137.56" dur="6.48">let&amp;#39;s start off how in the UK we</text>
  <text start="139.84" dur="7.02">understand that the brexit is still in</text>
  <text start="144.04" dur="4.83">flux we know the brexit party they are</text>
  <text start="146.86" dur="5">gaining and I do believe they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="148.87" dur="5.88">be getting some seats in parliament and</text>
  <text start="151.86" dur="5.1">who knows maybe even now Nigel Faraj</text>
  <text start="154.75" dur="5.319">maybe he&amp;#39;ll become the Prime Minister</text>
  <text start="156.96" dur="6.44">Trump believes this might even happen</text>
  <text start="160.069" dur="5.491">he&amp;#39;s ready to make a deal with the UK he</text>
  <text start="163.4" dur="7.289">wants the brexit deal actually he&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="165.56" dur="6.899">for a No Deal brexit and we can see that</text>
  <text start="170.689" dur="4.11">the European Union we can see that</text>
  <text start="172.459" dur="5.521">certain individuals they are very</text>
  <text start="174.799" dur="5.701">nervous about this brexit deal they</text>
  <text start="177.98" dur="5.97">don&amp;#39;t want it to happen once this</text>
  <text start="180.5" dur="5.489">happens the entire system goes into flux</text>
  <text start="183.95" dur="3.629">other countries are going to look at</text>
  <text start="185.989" dur="4.051">this other countries are going to</text>
  <text start="187.579" dur="5.601">observe and then you&amp;#39;re gonna see other</text>
  <text start="190.04" dur="6.479">countries maneuver in the same exact way</text>
  <text start="193.18" dur="5.77">which means the EU it looks like the</text>
  <text start="196.519" dur="5.041">clock is ticking down now very</text>
  <text start="198.95" dur="4.92">interestingly we know that the UK is</text>
  <text start="201.56" dur="5.069">having a problem with the British steel</text>
  <text start="203.87" dur="6.33">industry and the brexit party they have</text>
  <text start="206.629" dur="6.78">announced its common-sense economic plan</text>
  <text start="210.2" dur="4.77">for British steel now what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="213.409" dur="3.601">trying to say here and this is coming</text>
  <text start="214.97" dur="4.32">from Party Chairman Richard theis he</text>
  <text start="217.01" dur="4.74">said steel is a strategic national</text>
  <text start="219.29" dur="4.199">interest our view is that we in this</text>
  <text start="221.75" dur="4.049">country are our government should be</text>
  <text start="223.489" dur="4.801">able to decide what is required to</text>
  <text start="225.799" dur="5.641">protect preserve and invest in such</text>
  <text start="228.29" dur="4.919">ventures and of course as we all know if</text>
  <text start="231.44" dur="3.9">you remember of the European Union under</text>
  <text start="233.209" dur="4.381">state age rules you can&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="235.34" dur="4.47">which is why we&amp;#39;re in the pickle we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="237.59" dur="3.66">in currently the government is running</text>
  <text start="239.81" dur="4.769">around trying to find private-sector</text>
  <text start="241.25" dur="6.75">buyers to keep it going well all you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="244.579" dur="6.72">doing is retread of the existing</text>
  <text start="248" dur="5.43">situation where Graybill bought it for a</text>
  <text start="251.299" dur="4.47">pound from Tata</text>
  <text start="253.43" dur="4.589">we&amp;#39;ve got 2 blast furnaces in this</text>
  <text start="255.769" dur="6.06">country when you shut down a blast</text>
  <text start="258.019" dur="6.93">furnace its terminada when it goes cold</text>
  <text start="261.829" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s it so what&amp;#39;s needed is a</text>
  <text start="264.949" dur="4.561">completely different type of structure</text>
  <text start="266.539" dur="5.31">what we call a strategic national</text>
  <text start="269.51" dur="4.86">corporation which would be which would</text>
  <text start="271.849" dur="4.56">blend a long-term patient government</text>
  <text start="274.37" dur="4.38">capital private sector capital and</text>
  <text start="276.409" dur="4.021">expertise as well as some employee</text>
  <text start="278.75" dur="3.389">motivational involvement in the</text>
  <text start="280.43" dur="3.959">corporation so that actually the</text>
  <text start="282.139" dur="4.681">employees themselves benefit as they</text>
  <text start="284.389" dur="4.65">improve productivity we think that this</text>
  <text start="286.82" dur="4.319">is sort of approach that government</text>
  <text start="289.039" dur="4.831">should be taking for things like steel</text>
  <text start="291.139" dur="4.411">now you might find that unusual</text>
  <text start="293.87" dur="3.93">or what is considered to be a party on</text>
  <text start="295.55" dur="7.08">the right but it&amp;#39;s what we call common</text>
  <text start="297.8" dur="8.13">sense politics now remember they really</text>
  <text start="302.63" dur="7.289">don&amp;#39;t have any seats yet in Westminster</text>
  <text start="305.93" dur="5.88">but they are pushing forward an economic</text>
  <text start="309.919" dur="4.911">plan the people are going to hear this</text>
  <text start="311.81" dur="6.66">economic plan and they&amp;#39;re going to agree</text>
  <text start="314.83" dur="6.309">because it&amp;#39;s common sense and remember</text>
  <text start="318.47" dur="5.58">this is not part of the European Union</text>
  <text start="321.139" dur="7.381">this is not part of the good ol boy</text>
  <text start="324.05" dur="6.929">network plan this is the people&amp;#39;s plan</text>
  <text start="328.52" dur="5.43">where they&amp;#39;re trying to maneuver and</text>
  <text start="330.979" dur="6.471">pivot away from what has been done in</text>
  <text start="333.95" dur="5.939">the past to make the country great and</text>
  <text start="337.45" dur="5.08">this is what the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="339.889" dur="6.181">afraid of think about what is going on</text>
  <text start="342.53" dur="6.509">right now if all these countries make</text>
  <text start="346.07" dur="7.74">their country great without the central</text>
  <text start="349.039" dur="6.121">bank without the elite what if what is</text>
  <text start="353.81" dur="4.05">the elite what is the central bank going</text>
  <text start="355.16" dur="5.759">to do everyone&amp;#39;s gonna look at them and</text>
  <text start="357.86" dur="5.01">say we&amp;#39;re better without you they this</text>
  <text start="360.919" dur="5.401">is their biggest fear they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="362.87" dur="6.169">people to understand this but the people</text>
  <text start="366.32" dur="5.54">are waking up this is their biggest fear</text>
  <text start="369.039" dur="5.261">now if we look here in the United States</text>
  <text start="371.86" dur="5.29">and we look at the central bank economy</text>
  <text start="374.3" dur="5.88">it is continually falling apart I mean</text>
  <text start="377.15" dur="5.67">if you look out in UK their economy</text>
  <text start="380.18" dur="4.919">under the European Union under the elite</text>
  <text start="382.82" dur="5.819">it is falling apart if you look at any</text>
  <text start="385.099" dur="6">country around the globe under a central</text>
  <text start="388.639" dur="5.911">bank economy a private central bank</text>
  <text start="391.099" dur="6.421">economy it is falling apart countries go</text>
  <text start="394.55" dur="7.29">into debt the central bank controls that</text>
  <text start="397.52" dur="6.899">country and the central bankers they are</text>
  <text start="401.84" dur="3.93">panicking right now but here in the</text>
  <text start="404.419" dur="4.051">United States we can see the central</text>
  <text start="405.77" dur="4.98">bank system imploding on itself remember</text>
  <text start="408.47" dur="4.35">there are two things happening right now</text>
  <text start="410.75" dur="4.349">we have the central bank system which is</text>
  <text start="412.82" dur="4.5">imploding and we have the new economy</text>
  <text start="415.099" dur="4.29">which is coming in which Trump is trying</text>
  <text start="417.32" dur="4.529">to transition us into once it is</text>
  <text start="419.389" dur="5.431">established and we are getting very very</text>
  <text start="421.849" dur="5.161">close to this now if we look at factory</text>
  <text start="424.82" dur="2.67">orders right now they were revised lower</text>
  <text start="427.01" dur="4.02">from</text>
  <text start="427.49" dur="6.45">arch from 1.9 to 1.3 which prompted</text>
  <text start="431.03" dur="6.75">April&amp;#39;s 0.8 decline to look slightly</text>
  <text start="433.94" dur="5.789">better than the expected 1.0 decline now</text>
  <text start="437.78" dur="3.479">we know that they manipulate numbers</text>
  <text start="439.729" dur="5.041">they play with numbers to make things</text>
  <text start="441.259" dur="7.821">look a lot better but again under a</text>
  <text start="444.77" dur="8.94">central bank economy the system was not</text>
  <text start="449.08" dur="6.459">created to flourish it was created to do</text>
  <text start="453.71" dur="4.56">well in the beginning to make everyone</text>
  <text start="455.539" dur="5.16">think that everything is great to</text>
  <text start="458.27" dur="5.16">stagnate in the middle and then decline</text>
  <text start="460.699" dur="4.951">in the end we&amp;#39;re at the end stage right</text>
  <text start="463.43" dur="5.54">now Trump the Patriots they know this</text>
  <text start="465.65" dur="7.169">this is why they&amp;#39;re moving very quickly</text>
  <text start="468.97" dur="6.28">to keep the system alive now we know</text>
  <text start="472.819" dur="4.771">there&amp;#39;s nothing that Trump can do with a</text>
  <text start="475.25" dur="4.38">central bank economy it will implode on</text>
  <text start="477.59" dur="4.41">itself there&amp;#39;s nothing you can do the</text>
  <text start="479.63" dur="5.039">debt level is just way too high the</text>
  <text start="482" dur="5.069">weight of the debt is too much for the</text>
  <text start="484.669" dur="3.78">system and when you don&amp;#39;t have enough</text>
  <text start="487.069" dur="3.271">tax receipts coming in when you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="488.449" dur="4.56">have enough people working guess what</text>
  <text start="490.34" dur="6.84">the interest the debt it completely</text>
  <text start="493.009" dur="5.88">takes over but for months Trump has been</text>
  <text start="497.18" dur="4.53">pushing the Federal Reserve by tweeting</text>
  <text start="498.889" dur="6.33">out to cut interest rates to make the</text>
  <text start="501.71" dur="6.389">economy take off like a rocket ship now</text>
  <text start="505.219" dur="5.491">Trump is pushing tariffs on many</text>
  <text start="508.099" dur="4.651">countries yes this is being used to</text>
  <text start="510.71" dur="6.24">equalize trade for the transition but he</text>
  <text start="512.75" dur="6.839">is also using this push to push the Fed</text>
  <text start="516.95" dur="4.44">in a certain direction remember just</text>
  <text start="519.589" dur="3.39">because something happens it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="521.39" dur="5.52">mean it&amp;#39;s not part of many different</text>
  <text start="522.979" dur="5.821">agendas remember he needs the mainstream</text>
  <text start="526.91" dur="4.29">media the deep state players to think</text>
  <text start="528.8" dur="6.72">that the Fed is independent and is not</text>
  <text start="531.2" dur="7.92">making the decisions from Trump that</text>
  <text start="535.52" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re making decisions on its own so</text>
  <text start="539.12" dur="6.63">his latest move allows the Fed to use</text>
  <text start="541.01" dur="7.319">this as a narrative we need to lower the</text>
  <text start="545.75" dur="4.95">rates because of the trade wars that are</text>
  <text start="548.329" dur="4.5">happening right now we need to lower the</text>
  <text start="550.7" dur="6.02">rates because we&amp;#39;re nervous that the</text>
  <text start="552.829" dur="5.88">trade wars will make the economy decline</text>
  <text start="556.72" dur="4.75">think about what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="558.709" dur="5.251">the Fed has a narrative</text>
  <text start="561.47" dur="4.74">a story to tell the mainstream media to</text>
  <text start="563.96" dur="4.56">tell the deep state to tell the bad</text>
  <text start="566.21" dur="6.6">actors within the central bank this is</text>
  <text start="568.52" dur="7.38">why we need to lower rates because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="572.81" dur="4.08">nervous and afraid the economy might not</text>
  <text start="575.9" dur="5.97">survive</text>
  <text start="576.89" dur="8.19">and right now Fed Bullard says wheat US</text>
  <text start="581.87" dur="7.26">inflation and global trade tensions may</text>
  <text start="585.08" dur="6.87">warrant a rate cut and he went on to say</text>
  <text start="589.13" dur="5.19">and this is coming out of CNBC a US</text>
  <text start="591.95" dur="4.14">interest rate cut may be warranted soon</text>
  <text start="594.32" dur="4.56">given the rising risk to economic growth</text>
  <text start="596.09" dur="8.31">posed by global trade tensions as well</text>
  <text start="598.88" dur="9.02">as weak US inflation so already they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="604.4" dur="7.89">projecting out there that a rate cut is</text>
  <text start="607.9" dur="6.61">coming well that didn&amp;#39;t take long when</text>
  <text start="612.29" dur="4.74">do we say a rate cut was going to occur</text>
  <text start="614.51" dur="4.83">most likely by the end of the summer</text>
  <text start="617.03" dur="3.29">beginning of the fall are they preparing</text>
  <text start="619.34" dur="3.87">for a rate cut</text>
  <text start="620.32" dur="7.12">absolutely who&amp;#39;s in control the Patriots</text>
  <text start="623.21" dur="8.49">let&amp;#39;s take this a step further Powell in</text>
  <text start="627.44" dur="6.84">a surprising twist said with the economy</text>
  <text start="631.7" dur="5.88">growing unemployment low and inflation</text>
  <text start="634.28" dur="7.35">stable it&amp;#39;s time to rethink long-run</text>
  <text start="637.58" dur="7.83">strategies he&amp;#39;s hinting that both QE and</text>
  <text start="641.63" dur="6.51">zerp and perhaps nerves are now on deck</text>
  <text start="645.41" dur="4.56">but wait there&amp;#39;s more because in the</text>
  <text start="648.14" dur="3.48">clearest indication that the Fed is</text>
  <text start="649.97" dur="4.32">panicking about losing control over</text>

  <text start="654.29" dur="5.79">my FOMC colleagues and I must and do</text>
  <text start="657.56" dur="5.31">take seriously the risk that inflation</text>
  <text start="660.08" dur="5.64">shortfalls that persist even in a robust</text>
