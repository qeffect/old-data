  <text start="107.28" dur="5.58">remember the Senate was the key we also</text>
  <text start="110.19" dur="4.47">know that John Durham right now his</text>
  <text start="112.86" dur="3.21">scope of the investigation is much much</text>
  <text start="114.66" dur="3.18">broader than we originally thought we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="116.07" dur="3.69">gonna be talking about that in just a</text>
  <text start="117.84" dur="4.29">moment we&amp;#39;re also going to be talking</text>
  <text start="119.76" dur="5.97">about how Trump tweeted out some</text>
  <text start="122.13" dur="7.079">information that matches aq post which</text>
  <text start="125.73" dur="5.16">might be sending a message to all of us</text>
  <text start="129.209" dur="3.121">and we&amp;#39;ll be talking about that a little</text>
  <text start="130.89" dur="3.51">bit later in this report but first I</text>
  <text start="132.33" dur="4.11">wanted to start off with Julian Assange</text>
  <text start="134.4" dur="4.41">it looks like the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="136.44" dur="4.23">had made has made its formal request to</text>
  <text start="138.81" dur="5.22">the UK to extradite WikiLeaks founder</text>
  <text start="140.67" dur="5.52">Julian Assange so the u.s. made this</text>
  <text start="144.03" dur="5.039">official extradition request to the UK</text>
  <text start="146.19" dur="4.56">last third 8:00 Thursday June 6 the</text>
  <text start="149.069" dur="4.231">extradition treaty between the UK and</text>
  <text start="150.75" dur="4.65">the u.s. signed in 2003 and made</text>
  <text start="153.3" dur="3.87">effective in 2007 required that the</text>
  <text start="155.4" dur="3.12">formal request for extradition and the</text>
  <text start="157.17" dur="3.81">documents supporting the extradition</text>
  <text start="158.52" dur="3.84">request had to be received within 60</text>
  <text start="160.98" dur="4.5">days of Assange arrest back</text>
  <text start="162.36" dur="5.67">on April 11th the next extradition</text>
  <text start="165.48" dur="5.16">hearing had been scheduled for June 12th</text>
  <text start="168.03" dur="4.86">which is tomorrow but WikiLeaks is</text>
  <text start="170.64" dur="4.47">saying that it&amp;#39;s been moved to June 14th</text>
  <text start="172.89" dur="3.96">so we&amp;#39;ll have to see how this really</text>
  <text start="175.11" dur="4.71">plays out and when this hearing really</text>
  <text start="176.85" dur="5.22">is but like I said before I do believe</text>
  <text start="179.82" dur="4.17">the Patriots are in control they want to</text>
  <text start="182.07" dur="3.9">bring Assange back to the United States</text>
  <text start="183.99" dur="4.92">they want to protect them this is why</text>
  <text start="185.97" dur="5.52">they used the charges that he was</text>
  <text start="188.91" dur="4.83">working with Chelsea Manning and they</text>
  <text start="191.49" dur="5.58">could have used so many other charges</text>
  <text start="193.74" dur="5.22">and it seems like they picked the ones</text>
  <text start="197.07" dur="5.16">that they knew they can get around and</text>
  <text start="198.96" dur="5.1">that they couldn&amp;#39;t approve and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="202.23" dur="4.35">using them just to extradite Assange</text>
  <text start="204.06" dur="5.1">back to the United States remember he is</text>
  <text start="206.58" dur="4.95">the source and I do believe he is</text>
  <text start="209.16" dur="4.77">protected I do believe the Patriots</text>
  <text start="211.53" dur="4.86">aren&amp;#39;t in control and they want him back</text>
  <text start="213.93" dur="4.29">here and this is going to tie into all</text>
  <text start="216.39" dur="4.65">the seals and diamonds it&amp;#39;s going to tie</text>
  <text start="218.22" dur="5.489">in to all the investigations when the</text>
  <text start="221.04" dur="6.18">FISA D class happens and everything else</text>

  <text start="319.729" dur="4.111">are back from North Korea maybe you were</text>
  <text start="322.34" dur="2.939">thinking about this when you said the</text>
  <text start="323.84" dur="4.049">President of the United States was</text>
  <text start="325.279" dur="3.901">incapable of doing anything were you</text>
  <text start="327.889" dur="3">thinking about the fact that the embassy</text>
  <text start="329.18" dur="4.769">is now in Jerusalem I mean I think about</text>
  <text start="330.889" dur="4.89">this one every single candidate for many</text>
