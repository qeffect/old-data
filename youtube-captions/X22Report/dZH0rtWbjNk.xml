  <text start="77.52" dur="5.94">holiday season the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="80.64" dur="5.909">government they&amp;#39;re all trying to make us</text>
  <text start="83.46" dur="4.199">believe that retail sales are going to</text>
  <text start="86.549" dur="3.96">be fantastic</text>
  <text start="87.659" dur="5.13">there are even pushing the idea that</text>
  <text start="90.509" dur="5.4">retail is better than it&amp;#39;s ever been</text>
  <text start="92.789" dur="5.37">before while you know thousands of</text>

  <text start="105.479" dur="7.381">and major retail debt is coming due in</text>
  <text start="110.689" dur="5.621">2018 in the beginning of the year</text>
  <text start="112.86" dur="6.03">and now we get word that H&amp;amp;M the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="116.31" dur="7.619">second largest clothing retailer guess</text>
  <text start="118.89" dur="8.069">what their sales have crashed they</text>
  <text start="123.929" dur="6">unexpectedly dropped in the fourth</text>
  <text start="126.959" dur="6.241">quarter of 2017 and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="129.929" dur="6.241">interesting about this is that this is</text>
  <text start="133.2" dur="5.929">happening to many many stores not just</text>
  <text start="136.17" dur="10.739">one first of all their sales are down</text>
  <text start="139.129" dur="11.431">30% this year when you see this during</text>
  <text start="146.909" dur="9.5">the holiday season in the fourth quarter</text>
  <text start="150.56" dur="8.5">we&amp;#39;ve got problems we saw this back in</text>
  <text start="156.409" dur="5.5">2016 during the holiday season when</text>
  <text start="159.06" dur="4.86">stores during the holiday season they</text>
  <text start="161.909" dur="2.97">were declaring bankruptcy because they</text>
  <text start="163.92" dur="3.599">couldn&amp;#39;t make it</text>
  <text start="164.879" dur="4.83">and of course they try to explain this</text>
  <text start="167.519" dur="5.101">away saying it was the weather it was</text>
  <text start="169.709" dur="5.431">online sales know the reason for this is</text>
  <text start="172.62" dur="4.92">because people don&amp;#39;t have the funds</text>
  <text start="175.14" dur="6.48">people don&amp;#39;t have the jobs the wages are</text>
  <text start="177.54" dur="6.18">declining and this is why people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="181.62" dur="3.66">spending in retail this is why stores</text>
  <text start="183.72" dur="2.7">are closing this is why they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="185.28" dur="2.85">bankrupt</text>
  <text start="186.42" dur="6.42">this is why the corporate media has to</text>
  <text start="188.13" dur="6.27">push these ideas the illusion that the</text>
  <text start="192.84" dur="4.11">retail industry is doing well during the</text>
  <text start="194.4" dur="5.19">holiday season they did it back in 2016</text>
  <text start="196.95" dur="3.78">then of course 2017 came and then they</text>
  <text start="199.59" dur="3.36">had to change their tune because</text>
  <text start="200.73" dur="3.96">everyone was declaring bankruptcy storm</text>
  <text start="202.95" dur="3.75">losses ends up talking about not just</text>
  <text start="204.69" dur="4.379">like five stores we&amp;#39;re talking thousands</text>
  <text start="206.7" dur="5.43">of stores were closing and we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="209.069" dur="5.611">the same thing happen once again we see</text>
  <text start="212.13" dur="4.41">that industrial production well it is</text>
  <text start="214.68" dur="2.97">disappointed in November and when we</text>
  <text start="216.54" dur="4.919">look at this we could see that they</text>
  <text start="217.65" dur="5.25">expected to be up by 0.3% it only went</text>
  <text start="221.459" dur="3.241">up by 0.2 percent but a lot of the</text>
  <text start="222.9" dur="3.36">numbers were revised in October from</text>
  <text start="224.7" dur="3.93">point nine percent to one point two</text>
  <text start="226.26" dur="3.78">percent and they gave a little push to</text>
  <text start="228.63" dur="3.06">the November number to get very close to</text>
  <text start="230.04" dur="3.84">the expected number but it&amp;#39;s much lower</text>
  <text start="231.69" dur="4.89">than that but what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is</text>
  <text start="233.88" dur="7.4">that the Dow Industrial Average has</text>
  <text start="236.58" dur="8.31">recovered and we can see that industrial</text>
  <text start="241.28" dur="6.76">production continues to lag now we know</text>
  <text start="244.89" dur="5.58">the Dow Jones Industrial Average this is</text>
  <text start="248.04" dur="5.16">manipulated and pushed up very very high</text>
  <text start="250.47" dur="5.97">industrial production still manipulated</text>
  <text start="253.2" dur="5.789">but we can see that not as much because</text>
  <text start="256.44" dur="4.799">there&amp;#39;s just so much they can do and we</text>
  <text start="258.989" dur="8.221">see that industrial production really</text>
  <text start="261.239" dur="8.791">hasn&amp;#39;t moved anywhere since 2014 and we</text>
  <text start="267.21" dur="5.43">see that all these numbers and</text>
  <text start="270.03" dur="4.74">everything the corporate media the</text>
  <text start="272.64" dur="4.77">government is throwing at us it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="274.77" dur="5.19">made up now what&amp;#39;s very interesting and</text>
  <text start="277.41" dur="5.009">we know we know this for a very long</text>
  <text start="279.96" dur="4.61">time that the central banks they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="282.419" dur="4.951">preparing for a collapse they wanted to</text>
  <text start="284.57" dur="4.18">pump this entire system up make everyone</text>
  <text start="287.37" dur="3.15">believe make everyone think that</text>
  <text start="288.75" dur="3.289">everything is great this is how it works</text>
  <text start="290.52" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re not gonna crash the economy</text>
  <text start="292.039" dur="4.211">while everyone thinks the economy is</text>
  <text start="294.63" dur="3.659">doing poorly and nobody invests in the</text>
  <text start="296.25" dur="4.95">stock market nobody purchase houses</text>
  <text start="298.289" dur="5.85">nobody goes into retail that it wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="301.2" dur="7.04">make sense because to rob you of your</text>
  <text start="304.139" dur="8.4">wealth Nate they need everyone all in</text>
  <text start="308.24" dur="8.32">how else do you do this you can&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="312.539" dur="6.211">okay listen the economy is not doing</text>
  <text start="316.56" dur="3.689">great it&amp;#39;s doing very poorly make sure</text>
  <text start="318.75" dur="3.359">you don&amp;#39;t invest in the stock market</text>
  <text start="320.249" dur="3.45">make sure you don&amp;#39;t purchase bonds make</text>
  <text start="322.109" dur="2.91">sure you don&amp;#39;t buy houses you know</text>
  <text start="323.699" dur="2.88">shopping retail make sure you don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="325.019" dur="3.6">any of these things and then crash the</text>
  <text start="326.579" dur="3.57">economy well that wouldn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="328.619" dur="4.56">for the central bankers because their</text>
  <text start="330.149" dur="5.34">job is to rob you of your wealth and the</text>
  <text start="333.179" dur="4.92">only way to do this is to get you all in</text>
  <text start="335.489" dur="5.28">to make you believe and think that the</text>
  <text start="338.099" dur="4.2">economy&amp;#39;s doing well so you go and you</text>
  <text start="340.769" dur="4.11">go ahead and you spend as much as you</text>
  <text start="342.299" dur="5.31">possibly can put it on your credit card</text>
  <text start="344.879" dur="5.73">invest in the stock market purchase the</text>
  <text start="347.609" dur="4.35">home purchase the car go back to college</text>
  <text start="350.609" dur="3.54">and remember all this has to do with</text>
  <text start="351.959" dur="4.32">taking out debt because this is what</text>
  <text start="354.149" dur="5.19">they really like this is how they get</text>
  <text start="356.279" dur="5.79">you into the system this is how they</text>
  <text start="359.339" dur="5.49">fool you and what&amp;#39;s very interesting as</text>
  <text start="362.069" dur="5.61">JP Morgan came out and they said this is</text>
  <text start="364.829" dur="6.69">fascinating because it looks like at</text>
  <text start="367.679" dur="6.26">this moment everyone went all-in now</text>
  <text start="371.519" dur="7.85">what do they mean by that they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="373.939" dur="9.43">that everyone is all-in in stocks and</text>
  <text start="379.369" dur="6.19">it&amp;#39;s not just retail investors US</text>

  <text start="394.079" dur="6.12">retail investors you can notice the</text>
  <text start="396.809" dur="5.46">margin debt as measured as a percent as</text>
  <text start="400.199" dur="6.63">a percentage of market capitalization is</text>
  <text start="402.269" dur="8.16">at its highest point ever which includes</text>
  <text start="406.829" dur="6.75">the 2000 tech bubble the percentage of</text>
  <text start="410.429" dur="8.431">US household wealth in equities is in</text>
  <text start="413.579" dur="8.281">its 94th percentile and above its 2007</text>
  <text start="418.86" dur="5.459">peak why did this what is this all</text>
  <text start="421.86" dur="5.549">matter because with everyone already</text>
  <text start="424.319" dur="8.76">long stocks there is no marginal buyer</text>
  <text start="427.409" dur="8.1">left there is only so much the market</text>
  <text start="433.079" dur="7.22">can can rally if equity investors are</text>
  <text start="435.509" dur="8.28">already near maximal allocations</text>
  <text start="440.299" dur="6.85">everyone has been suckered and everyone</text>
  <text start="443.789" dur="8.4">is in this is what the central bankers</text>
  <text start="447.149" dur="6.811">like go back in time go back to 2008 I</text>
  <text start="452.189" dur="4.171">mean the market hit four</text>
  <text start="453.96" dur="6.66">10,000 points it was an all time new</text>
  <text start="456.36" dur="7.649">high go back to the tech bubble go back</text>
  <text start="460.62" dur="7.019">all the way to 1929 you could see at</text>

  <text start="467.639" dur="6.301">time new highs and the whole thing came</text>
  <text start="470.13" dur="5.31">crashing down everyone was all in and we</text>
  <text start="473.94" dur="4.83">could see that the central bankers</text>
  <text start="475.44" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;re already putting out breadcrumbs</text>
  <text start="478.77" dur="5.519">feelers propaganda whatever you want to</text>
  <text start="481.56" dur="4.8">call it to make you think that the</text>
  <text start="484.289" dur="4.861">economy is going to crash because of</text>
  <text start="486.36" dur="4.649">some other reason but them now remember</text>
  <text start="489.15" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;ve been running the country</text>
  <text start="491.009" dur="5.34">remember they push stimulus remember</text>
  <text start="494.07" dur="4.56">they bought up all the toxic real estate</text>
  <text start="496.349" dur="4.051">they create currency out of thin air</text>
  <text start="498.63" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;ve been telling us the banks have</text>
  <text start="500.4" dur="7.079">been strong and they&amp;#39;re out there saying</text>
  <text start="503.43" dur="7.709">that Trump&amp;#39;s tax cut could play a</text>
  <text start="507.479" dur="7.141">negative role in the next downturn of</text>
  <text start="511.139" dur="6.541">the economy now who said this Janet</text>
  <text start="514.62" dur="5.19">Yellen didn&amp;#39;t she say that we weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="517.68" dur="4.289">gonna see another crisis in our lifetime</text>
  <text start="519.81" dur="6.3">didn&amp;#39;t she say that everything is</text>
  <text start="521.969" dur="7.771">contained well now she&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="526.11" dur="4.94">this tax cut well this might damage the</text>
  <text start="529.74" dur="4.34">economy</text>
  <text start="531.05" dur="6.46">remember they needed a period of time</text>
  <text start="534.08" dur="5.73">for Trump to be in office they needed</text>
  <text start="537.51" dur="6.079">this time for him to take responsibility</text>
  <text start="539.81" dur="7.6">and to have the economy under his belt</text>
  <text start="543.589" dur="7.211">well he&amp;#39;s done this and they see it and</text>
  <text start="547.41" dur="6.179">they&amp;#39;re making their move and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="550.8" dur="4.95">ready to bring this down actually Gregg</text>
  <text start="553.589" dur="4.891">Mannarino is out there and he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="555.75" dur="5.82">that there&amp;#39;s a major red flag that could</text>
  <text start="558.48" dur="5.729">signal a reversal going forward he said</text>
  <text start="561.57" dur="5.459">if there&amp;#39;s one thing that you need to</text>
  <text start="564.209" dur="4.801">pay attention to is this savage bond</text>
  <text start="567.029" dur="5.761">buying occurred today an attempt to</text>
  <text start="569.01" dur="5.699">repress our c&amp;#39;t and it didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="572.79" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re trying to play a game here and</text>
  <text start="574.709" dur="4.921">it&amp;#39;s been working time and time again</text>
  <text start="576.45" dur="6.75">without fail every single time except</text>
  <text start="579.63" dur="6.82">for today it has worked they are buying</text>
  <text start="583.2" dur="6.4">bonds here at a feverish pace and</text>
  <text start="586.45" dur="5.88">it failed to prop up stocks he said that</text>
  <text start="589.6" dur="5.34">to me is a red flag the question is not</text>
  <text start="592.33" dur="4.14">when we will enter a collapse we are</text>
  <text start="594.94" dur="4.08">already in the midst of the economic</text>
  <text start="596.47" dur="5.55">collapse the real question is when will</text>
  <text start="599.02" dur="5.94">the uneducated and the biased finally</text>
  <text start="602.02" dur="4.83">notice they will notice when the market</text>
  <text start="604.96" dur="4.68">comes down because that is the last</text>
  <text start="606.85" dur="4.77">thing the central bankers have and that</text>
  <text start="609.64" dur="4.67">is the signal that the economy is not</text>
  <text start="611.62" dur="6.54">doing well that something just happened</text>
  <text start="614.31" dur="7.93">that we crashed but if we look back in</text>
  <text start="618.16" dur="6.36">time and we look back years ago we know</text>
  <text start="622.24" dur="6.08">it just didn&amp;#39;t happen at that point it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="624.52" dur="6.39">been happening they set up this illusion</text>
  <text start="628.32" dur="4.69">GDP was manipulated unemployment was</text>
  <text start="630.91" dur="5.13">manipulated retail numbers are</text>
  <text start="633.01" dur="5.76">manipulated it&amp;#39;s all manipulated to make</text>
  <text start="636.04" dur="4.5">you think that everything is great they</text>
  <text start="638.77" dur="4.11">pumped up the housing bubble in 20</text>
  <text start="640.54" dur="4.41">cities banks were told to keep the</text>
  <text start="642.88" dur="6.3">houses off the market to write to push</text>
  <text start="644.95" dur="6.42">the prices up all of it was to make you</text>
  <text start="649.18" dur="3.8">think and they needed a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="651.37" dur="6.27">time because this was a huge crash in</text>
  <text start="652.98" dur="7.57">2008 they needed to push stimulus to</text>
  <text start="657.64" dur="6.18">create these bubbles and they need a</text>
  <text start="660.55" dur="6.09">time for everyone to believe that things</text>
  <text start="663.82" dur="4.89">were okay you just can&amp;#39;t do it in a year</text>
  <text start="666.64" dur="4.76">or two when everyone&amp;#39;s losing their job</text>
  <text start="668.71" dur="6.45">when everyone&amp;#39;s not feeling that great</text>
  <text start="671.4" dur="6.61">when companies aren&amp;#39;t expanding when the</text>

  <text start="678.01" dur="4.59">time to over overcome that which takes</text>
  <text start="680.08" dur="4.65">about two three years and then it</text>
  <text start="682.6" dur="4.59">eating&amp;#39;s another two three years to</text>
  <text start="684.73" dur="5.37">build the bubbles up then another two</text>
  <text start="687.19" dur="5.43">three years to make everyone feel great</text>

  <text start="692.62" dur="8.04">is incredible and here we are at this</text>
  <text start="697.24" dur="6.54">point and we could see right now that</text>
  <text start="700.66" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re ready to purposely bring down</text>
  <text start="703.78" dur="2.99">this economy</text>
  <text start="704.74" dur="4.59">remember the central bankers have plans</text>
  <text start="706.77" dur="4.57">they know this system can&amp;#39;t last any</text>
  <text start="709.33" dur="2.85">longer that&amp;#39;s why they went to stimulus</text>
