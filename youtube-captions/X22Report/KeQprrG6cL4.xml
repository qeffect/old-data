  <text start="405.51" dur="5.51">Fed puts us at a competitive</text>
  <text start="407.19" dur="7.2">disadvantage China is not our problem</text>
  <text start="411.02" dur="6.49">the Federal Reserve is we will win</text>
  <text start="414.39" dur="5.1">anyway now really think about what he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="444.28" dur="4.919">letting everyone know that the Federal</text>
  <text start="445.87" dur="4.799">Reserve is a bigger problem than China</text>
  <text start="449.199" dur="3.931">and a lot of people think that China is</text>
  <text start="450.669" dur="4.791">a very big problem but the Federal</text>
  <text start="453.13" dur="4.86">Reserve is worse and it&amp;#39;s not because</text>
  <text start="455.46" dur="4.69">we&amp;#39;re not being competitive with other</text>
  <text start="457.99" dur="4.83">countries like Germany and Japan and the</text>
  <text start="460.15" dur="8.67">rest the Federal Reserve is a big</text>
  <text start="462.82" dur="8.37">problem because they are controlling not</text>
  <text start="468.82" dur="5.4">just the United States but other</text>
  <text start="471.19" dur="7.8">countries around the world by putting</text>
  <text start="474.22" dur="9.06">them into debt by enslaving the people</text>

  <text start="510.4" dur="9.21">said this before if the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="513.94" dur="9.81">System is so fantastic why do we need</text>
  <text start="519.61" dur="7.979">credit why do we need to take out loans</text>

  <text start="546.639" dur="5.99">dollars or two dollars a month</text>
  <text start="549.48" dur="7.089">why is everything broken down into</text>
  <text start="552.629" dur="7.301">payments and why does everyone need</text>
  <text start="556.569" dur="8.52">credit because if they don&amp;#39;t have credit</text>
  <text start="559.93" dur="9.06">they can&amp;#39;t survive it&amp;#39;s because the</text>
  <text start="565.089" dur="7.951">value of the dollar has decreased and</text>
  <text start="568.99" dur="7.05">you need so many of these dollars that</text>

  <text start="592.75" dur="5.43">able to live day to day think about</text>
  <text start="595.99" dur="4.589">yourself think about others that you</text>
  <text start="598.18" dur="6.18">know do you think they would be able to</text>
  <text start="600.579" dur="7.651">survive this is a central bank system at</text>
  <text start="604.36" dur="7.68">its end stage this is why Trump is out</text>
