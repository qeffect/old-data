  <text start="108.149" dur="5.371">get into the economic collapse news and</text>
  <text start="110.729" dur="6.901">what we are seeing out in the eurozone</text>
  <text start="113.52" dur="5.849">the industrial output has fallen and the</text>
  <text start="117.63" dur="4.65">official figures show industrial output</text>
  <text start="119.369" dur="6.42">in the 17-nation eurozone fell more than</text>
  <text start="122.28" dur="7.47">expected in 2013 it dropped around point</text>
  <text start="125.789" dur="6.541">seven percent and the drop was higher</text>
  <text start="129.75" dur="5.22">than the forecast and we understand that</text>
  <text start="132.33" dur="4.23">out in Europe and the rest of the world</text>
  <text start="134.97" dur="4.379">that has a private western central bank</text>
  <text start="136.56" dur="4.68">every single country is pretty much not</text>
  <text start="139.349" dur="3.691">doing well yes they can manipulate</text>
  <text start="141.24" dur="4.08">numbers they can pretend that we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="143.04" dur="4.59">recovery that everything is okay but if</text>
  <text start="145.32" dur="4.53">you really look across the eurozone you</text>
  <text start="147.63" dur="4.26">look into the u.s. you look at all the</text>
  <text start="149.85" dur="3.6">different countries everyone is in a</text>
  <text start="151.89" dur="3.27">different place of course I mean there</text>
  <text start="153.45" dur="5.19">if you look at Greece and Cyprus Spain</text>
  <text start="155.16" dur="4.8">and France it very high unemployment you</text>
  <text start="158.64" dur="2.76">look at the u.s. the numbers are</text>
  <text start="159.96" dur="3.6">manipulated so we&amp;#39;re looking at a six</text>
  <text start="161.4" dur="3.87">point six percent unemployment and those</text>
  <text start="163.56" dur="3.03">are completely manipulated the real</text>
  <text start="165.27" dur="2.67">unemployment is between thirty and</text>
  <text start="166.59" dur="3.6">thirty seven percent depending on the</text>
  <text start="167.94" dur="5.67">calculation again in Canada Australia</text>
  <text start="170.19" dur="6.69">all different numbers the UK but what</text>
  <text start="173.61" dur="5.34">what what the common theme is is most of</text>
  <text start="176.88" dur="5.85">these countries are in a housing type of</text>
  <text start="178.95" dur="6.9">bubble that people are having a very</text>
  <text start="182.73" dur="6.57">rough time making ends meet retail sales</text>
  <text start="185.85" dur="7.65">are not there and stores are closing and</text>
  <text start="189.3" dur="7.26">we can see that the entire system is</text>
  <text start="193.5" dur="4.8">starting to fall apart many people are</text>
  <text start="196.56" dur="3.99">going into their savings many people are</text>
  <text start="198.3" dur="4.8">going to get payday loans just to pay</text>
  <text start="200.55" dur="4.11">for rent and food and other things or</text>
  <text start="203.1" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re going to the government to get</text>
  <text start="204.66" dur="5.79">assistance and we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="207.48" dur="5.1">spreading all over the place now in the</text>
  <text start="210.45" dur="5.46">Bank of England they&amp;#39;re going to do a</text>
  <text start="212.58" dur="5.85">stress test just in case there is a</text>
  <text start="215.91" dur="5.58">property crash because we understand</text>
  <text start="218.43" dur="4.65">that housing is rising and the fed in</text>
  <text start="221.49" dur="3.72">the United States has created this</text>
  <text start="223.08" dur="5.76">housing bubble the UK has a housing</text>
  <text start="225.21" dur="5.61">bubble and right now what the Bank of</text>
  <text start="228.84" dur="7.2">England is going to do is they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="230.82" dur="7.11">to create this stress test and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="236.04" dur="4.56">examine whether banks will need bailing</text>
  <text start="237.93" dur="4.89">out or bailing in as seems more likely</text>
  <text start="240.6" dur="5.88">now if house prices materially correct</text>
  <text start="242.82" dur="6.42">again preparations have been or are</text>
  <text start="246.48" dur="4.47">being put in place by the international</text>
  <text start="249.24" dur="3.75">monetary and financial authorities</text>
  <text start="250.95" dur="4.08">including the Bank of England for</text>
  <text start="252.99" dur="3.51">balance the majority of the public are</text>
  <text start="255.03" dur="3.329">unaware of these developments of course</text>
  <text start="256.5" dur="3.6">and they have no idea what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="258.359" dur="4.321">the test is being drawn up by the bank</text>
  <text start="260.1" dur="5.31">financial policy committee whose members</text>
  <text start="262.68" dur="4.8">include governor mark carney many UK</text>
  <text start="265.41" dur="4.5">banks are already overextended and the</text>
  <text start="267.48" dur="6.18">real risk is that many banks would not</text>
  <text start="269.91" dur="4.729">be able to withstand house price falling</text>
  <text start="273.66" dur="4.069">the</text>
  <text start="274.639" dur="6.02">this heightens the risk of balance and</text>
  <text start="277.729" dur="8.34">we understand that the United States</text>
  <text start="280.659" dur="8.23">along with England created the FDIC Bank</text>
  <text start="286.069" dur="4.47">of England bail-in document then that</text>
  <text start="288.889" dur="3.99">document was taken in since what</text>
  <text start="290.539" dur="4.141">Switzerland created their own the</text>
  <text start="292.879" dur="3.78">eurozone created their own Australia</text>
  <text start="294.68" dur="5.099">created their own Canada created their</text>
  <text start="296.659" dur="6.06">own and we can see what is coming down</text>
  <text start="299.779" dur="5.341">the road here they are testing to see</text>
  <text start="302.719" dur="4.17">how this ballon document is going to</text>
  <text start="305.12" dur="3.99">work they did the primary test with</text>
  <text start="306.889" dur="4.5">Cyprus they believe that went well</text>
  <text start="309.11" dur="4.169">people didn&amp;#39;t riot people didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="311.389" dur="4.411">anything they were able to take forty</text>
  <text start="313.279" dur="4.531">seven percent of the people&amp;#39;s money and</text>
  <text start="315.8" dur="3.899">everything seems to be great they were</text>
  <text start="317.81" dur="5.609">able to keep capital controls in effect</text>
  <text start="319.699" dur="5.911">for a year now and they are they believe</text>
  <text start="323.419" dur="3.87">that everything will be fine once they</text>
  <text start="325.61" dur="4.229">do this across the board in all these</text>
  <text start="327.289" dur="4.56">countries and again you do not create a</text>
  <text start="329.839" dur="4.561">document unless you&amp;#39;re going to use it</text>
  <text start="331.849" dur="4.771">because they see what is going to how</text>
  <text start="334.4" dur="4.59">they see what&amp;#39;s going to happen in the</text>
  <text start="336.62" dur="6.06">future that all these banks once this</text>
  <text start="338.99" dur="6.66">bubble pops they will be able they will</text>
  <text start="342.68" dur="5.489">need to take the people&amp;#39;s money out of</text>
  <text start="345.65" dur="5.069">the bank because the government&amp;#39;s will</text>
  <text start="348.169" dur="5.641">no longer give them the money and this</text>
  <text start="350.719" dur="6.391">is why these documents were created now</text>
  <text start="353.81" dur="5.55">here in the US guess what mortgage</text>
  <text start="357.11" dur="5.579">applications dropped again and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="359.36" dur="5.399">hovering near a 19-year low purchase</text>
  <text start="362.689" dur="5.331">applications drop by five percent and</text>
  <text start="364.759" dur="7.14">they&amp;#39;re back to their lows again and</text>
  <text start="368.02" dur="6.34">there the mortgage applications for home</text>
  <text start="371.899" dur="5.49">purchases have basically flat lines</text>
  <text start="374.36" dur="5.459">since the forget the fed began QE and</text>
  <text start="377.389" dur="7.411">they hover now just above their lowest</text>
  <text start="379.819" dur="7.861">level since 1995 and again we can see</text>
  <text start="384.8" dur="5.399">what&amp;#39;s happening people just don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="387.68" dur="4.65">the credit they just don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="390.199" dur="5.131">disposable income they just don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="392.33" dur="4.41">the money in their savings to go out and</text>
  <text start="395.33" dur="3.329">purchase a home so what did the</text>
  <text start="396.74" dur="4.169">government try to do well they try to</text>
  <text start="398.659" dur="5.01">give a hundred percent financing to</text>
  <text start="400.909" dur="4.98">anyone that&amp;#39;s breathing and that didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="403.669" dur="4.141">work so what else did they try to do</text>
  <text start="405.889" dur="2.611">well now they tried they implemented</text>
  <text start="407.81" dur="2.73">arms</text>
  <text start="408.5" dur="3.57">which is the adjustable rate mortgage to</text>
  <text start="410.54" dur="3.51">get people to come in and a lower</text>
  <text start="412.07" dur="4.95">interest rate with a hundred percent</text>
  <text start="414.05" dur="6.2">financing and that isn&amp;#39;t working because</text>
  <text start="417.02" dur="6.51">you have to remember during 2008 we had</text>
  <text start="420.25" dur="4.74">millions and upon millions of properties</text>
  <text start="423.53" dur="4.95">probably in the billions actually of</text>
  <text start="424.99" dur="5.32">foreclosures and short sales and again</text>
  <text start="428.48" dur="4.59">all these people who had this problem</text>
  <text start="430.31" dur="4.65">their credit was ruined again then we</text>
  <text start="433.07" dur="4.08">had all these layoffs where people</text>
  <text start="434.96" dur="4.11">couldn&amp;#39;t find work that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="437.15" dur="4.2">underemployment came in because people</text>
  <text start="439.07" dur="3.51">how to take part time work to make ends</text>
  <text start="441.35" dur="4.35">meet and believe me when you&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="442.58" dur="8.19">part time you&amp;#39;re not saving up for a 200</text>
  <text start="445.7" dur="7.77">300 400 500 thousand dollar home so we</text>
  <text start="450.77" dur="4.32">can see what is going on here and again</text>
  <text start="453.47" dur="4.14">we&amp;#39;re seeing mortgage applications</text>
  <text start="455.09" dur="4.11">plunge and most of the homes that were</text>
  <text start="457.61" dur="4.77">purchased were by hedge funds and</text>
  <text start="459.2" dur="4.95">investment companies but the Fed and the</text>
  <text start="462.38" dur="3.06">banks they already knew this that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="464.15" dur="4.44">they were laying off their mortgage</text>
  <text start="465.44" dur="5.79">departments in 2013 between august and</text>
  <text start="468.59" dur="4.59">october they laid off thousands and</text>
  <text start="471.23" dur="4.38">thousands of people it was well fought</text>
  <text start="473.18" dur="6.78">Wells Fargo Citibank Bank of America</text>
  <text start="475.61" dur="6.3">wide 1 800 east coast mortgages and they</text>
  <text start="479.96" dur="5.73">have downsized their mortgage department</text>
  <text start="481.91" dur="6.03">and again if housing is booming you</text>
  <text start="485.69" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t downsize your mortgage departments</text>
  <text start="487.94" dur="3.99">they already knew what was coming they</text>
  <text start="490.19" dur="3.33">already they already took precautions</text>
  <text start="491.93" dur="4.77">and that&amp;#39;s why those people and those</text>
  <text start="493.52" dur="5.85">departments have shrunk down because</text>
  <text start="496.7" dur="5.58">they understand that housing is going</text>
  <text start="499.37" dur="5.76">nowhere and right now it&amp;#39;s flatlined</text>
  <text start="502.28" dur="6.93">it&amp;#39;s coming down and the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="505.13" dur="6.48">about to implode on itself now here we</text>
  <text start="509.21" dur="4.23">are again in February with the debt</text>
  <text start="511.61" dur="4.26">ceiling debate but this time there is no</text>
  <text start="513.44" dur="4.92">debate they decided that they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="515.87" dur="6.419">going to raise it because guess why they</text>
  <text start="518.36" dur="6.78">have no choice that it&amp;#39;s they cannot pay</text>
  <text start="522.289" dur="4.141">for all the programs that the government</text>
  <text start="525.14" dur="3.39">is supporting they can&amp;#39;t pay the</text>
  <text start="526.43" dur="4.59">interest on the debt because the revenue</text>
  <text start="528.53" dur="4.35">for the tax revenue is not there they</text>
  <text start="531.02" dur="3.96">can&amp;#39;t pay for all the programs that are</text>
  <text start="532.88" dur="4.41">going on so they have to continually</text>
  <text start="534.98" dur="4.83">borrow money and of course people around</text>
  <text start="537.29" dur="4.409">the world are looking at this going this</text>
  <text start="539.81" dur="3.689">debt is really getting out of control</text>
  <text start="541.699" dur="4.2">I don&amp;#39;t know if they can support this</text>
  <text start="543.499" dur="4.65">much longer and I&amp;#39;m wondering when this</text>
  <text start="545.899" dur="3.81">is going to collapse where the people in</text>
  <text start="548.149" dur="3.12">the united states are looking like oh</text>
  <text start="549.709" dur="3.81">yeah thank god we can borrow more money</text>
  <text start="551.269" dur="4.74">let&amp;#39;s just keep doing that where they</text>
  <text start="553.519" dur="4.831">don&amp;#39;t realize there will be a stopping</text>
  <text start="556.009" dur="4.05">point where people around the world</text>
  <text start="558.35" dur="4.289">they&amp;#39;re going to say okay enough is</text>
  <text start="560.059" dur="5.55">enough here they&amp;#39;re just printing money</text>
  <text start="562.639" dur="5.37">like crazy and the debt just keeps going</text>
  <text start="565.609" dur="4.35">up and they have no revenue they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="568.009" dur="5.01">producing anything in manufacturing and</text>
  <text start="569.959" dur="6.24">there&amp;#39;s no jobs so what is going on here</text>

  <text start="1319.77" dur="3.66">of Homeland Security through immigration</text>
  <text start="1321.15" dur="4.38">and customs enforcement have solicited</text>
  <text start="1323.43" dur="5.16">for commercial off-the-shelf technology</text>
  <text start="1325.53" dur="5.7">that allows DHS employees to track</text>
  <text start="1328.59" dur="4.68">citizens by using license plate tracking</text>
  <text start="1331.23" dur="3.96">readers on government vehicles and a</text>
  <text start="1333.27" dur="4.05">system known as the national license</text>
  <text start="1335.19" dur="4.47">plate recognition database and you have</text>
  <text start="1337.32" dur="5.01">to remember they are also creating the</text>
  <text start="1339.66" dur="3.69">Real ID which every state they want all</text>
  <text start="1342.33" dur="3.089">the states</text>
  <text start="1343.35" dur="5.13">so they can take all the information on</text>
  <text start="1345.419" dur="4.531">your license your name your address it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1348.48" dur="3.809">going to be with an iris scan your</text>
  <text start="1349.95" dur="3.96">fingerprint any DNA sample they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1352.289" dur="4.051">to match this up to your license plate</text>
  <text start="1353.91" dur="5.639">so they can always know where you are</text>
  <text start="1356.34" dur="6.69">and they always contract you all over</text>
  <text start="1359.549" dur="6.24">the place now the license plate tracking</text>
  <text start="1363.03" dur="5.13">system is not just for Homeland Security</text>
  <text start="1365.789" dur="3.871">what they&amp;#39;re going to do the system is</text>
  <text start="1368.16" dur="3.96">going to be shared with every</text>
  <text start="1369.66" dur="4.53">law-enforcement agency within the United</text>
  <text start="1372.12" dur="3.9">States data will be compiled from</text>
  <text start="1374.19" dur="4.56">metropolitan areas which can be searched</text>
  <text start="1376.02" dur="5.039">from smartphones so I mean iphone</text>
  <text start="1378.75" dur="5.429">android blackberry there are currently</text>
  <text start="1381.059" dur="4.921">in use by DHS or ice thus allowing for</text>
  <text start="1384.179" dur="4.051">license plate pictures to be taken and</text>
  <text start="1385.98" dur="4.559">uploaded cross-reference and then sent</text>
  <text start="1388.23" dur="5.46">to alert the officer agent of a positive</text>
  <text start="1390.539" dur="5.37">match so you can see what is going on</text>
  <text start="1393.69" dur="4.14">here this tracking of an individual that</text>
  <text start="1395.909" dur="4.861">can be accessed within a minute or a</text>
  <text start="1397.83" dur="4.56">second and they will know where you are</text>
  <text start="1400.77" dur="4.08">as long as you have driven into the</text>
  <text start="1402.39" dur="5.31">crosshairs of this new weapon and they</text>
  <text start="1404.85" dur="5.61">are using this to compile this gigantic</text>
  <text start="1407.7" dur="6.959">federal database they want to make sure</text>
  <text start="1410.46" dur="6.329">that every single person can be tracked</text>
  <text start="1414.659" dur="4.65">this is why they have the fusion centers</text>
  <text start="1416.789" dur="4.411">this is why there&amp;#39;s NSA this is why they</text>
  <text start="1419.309" dur="3.091">have the cameras on the blimp this is</text>
  <text start="1421.2" dur="3.15">why they have the drones with the</text>
  <text start="1422.4" dur="4.08">cameras this is why they have facial</text>
  <text start="1424.35" dur="5.25">recognition this is why they want all</text>
  <text start="1426.48" dur="4.949">states in with the Real ID system so</text>
  <text start="1429.6" dur="4.38">they can track you this is why they have</text>
  <text start="1431.429" dur="5.011">the license plate readers they are doing</text>
  <text start="1433.98" dur="4.11">this on purpose this is why they are</text>
  <text start="1436.44" dur="4.29">making sure that every local law</text>
  <text start="1438.09" dur="5.67">enforcement is in compliance with DHS</text>
  <text start="1440.73" dur="6.03">and they are giving them free tanks</text>
  <text start="1443.76" dur="6.539">they&amp;#39;re giving them grants and of course</text>
  <text start="1446.76" dur="5.58">the police the local police are happy</text>
  <text start="1450.299" dur="3.691">because they&amp;#39;re getting all this free</text>
  <text start="1452.34" dur="3.93">stuff and it&amp;#39;s they don&amp;#39;t have to worry</text>
  <text start="1453.99" dur="5.73">about their budget but again you have to</text>
  <text start="1456.27" dur="5.34">be in compliance with DHS because when</text>
  <text start="1459.72" dur="3.66">that when everything falls apart they</text>
  <text start="1461.61" dur="4.199">want to make sure that all these police</text>
  <text start="1463.38" dur="5.01">the local law enforcement all look to</text>
  <text start="1465.809" dur="6.391">DHS and this is why DHS is setting up</text>
  <text start="1468.39" dur="6.75">command centers in every single city and</text>
  <text start="1472.2" dur="4.77">town and they are pushing that forward</text>
  <text start="1475.14" dur="4.89">because they need to get all this</text>
  <text start="1476.97" dur="5.97">before the collapse comes and again this</text>
  <text start="1480.03" dur="5.19">is why they want to disarm the American</text>
  <text start="1482.94" dur="4.26">people because it&amp;#39;s much easier to</text>
  <text start="1485.22" dur="5.43">control someone who does not have a</text>
  <text start="1487.2" dur="6.06">weapon you they can just round them up</text>
  <text start="1490.65" dur="4.68">and move them to wherever they want now</text>
  <text start="1493.26" dur="3.6">DHS has taken this a step forward we</text>
  <text start="1495.33" dur="3.54">understand that they purchased billions</text>
  <text start="1496.86" dur="6.24">of rounds of ammunition they&amp;#39;ve about</text>
  <text start="1498.87" dur="8.28">2,700 tanks and now they are trying to</text>
  <text start="1503.1" dur="5.88">purchase sniper ammunition and again we</text>
  <text start="1507.15" dur="4.32">have to remember if you ever visit the</text>
  <text start="1508.98" dur="5">DHS website they&amp;#39;re alert system does</text>
  <text start="1511.47" dur="4.74">not work because they&amp;#39;re not looking for</text>
  <text start="1513.98" dur="4.179">foreign terrorists coming into the</text>
  <text start="1516.21" dur="4.38">United States and and committing a</text>
  <text start="1518.159" dur="6.481">terrorist act they&amp;#39;re looking for you</text>
  <text start="1520.59" dur="6.38">the US citizen as a terrorist that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1524.64" dur="5.31">they created the NDAA because the</text>
  <text start="1526.97" dur="4.36">government can tell they can say okay</text>
  <text start="1529.95" dur="4.109">that&amp;#39;s a terrorist that&amp;#39;s a terrorist</text>
  <text start="1531.33" dur="5.07">and there&amp;#39;s according to the NBA there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1534.059" dur="4.201">no due process you can be thrown in jail</text>
  <text start="1536.4" dur="4.17">for a year and this is how they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1538.26" dur="3.84">to come after everyone again this is of</text>
  <text start="1540.57" dur="3.75">course null and void according to the</text>
  <text start="1542.1" dur="4.62">Second Amendment but let me get back on</text>
  <text start="1544.32" dur="5.55">track here they have ordered sniper</text>
  <text start="1546.72" dur="5.189">ammunition this is the hornady 308 and</text>
  <text start="1549.87" dur="3.21">again the US government via the</text>
  <text start="1551.909" dur="3.361">department of homeland security</text>
  <text start="1553.08" dur="4.26">immigration and customs enforcement has</text>
  <text start="1555.27" dur="4.289">placed a solicitation for more sniper</text>
  <text start="1557.34" dur="4.579">ammo in this order they requesting a</text>
  <text start="1559.559" dur="6.691">hundred and forty-one thousand rounds of</text>
  <text start="1561.919" dur="6.851">sniper ammo now again if they&amp;#39;re worried</text>
  <text start="1566.25" dur="4.559">about terrorists how many terrorists are</text>
  <text start="1568.77" dur="5.909">they going to have to kill with sniper</text>
  <text start="1570.809" dur="5.191">round it absolutely makes no sense what</text>
  <text start="1574.679" dur="5.13">are these sniper round is going to be</text>
  <text start="1576" dur="5.34">used for right the people of the US and</text>
  <text start="1579.809" dur="3.571">this is why they need so much of it</text>
  <text start="1581.34" dur="5.88">because they&amp;#39;ll be stations all across</text>
  <text start="1583.38" dur="6.15">the country and there&amp;#39;s a lot of a lot</text>
  <text start="1587.22" dur="3.63">of people out there and this is why</text>
  <text start="1589.53" dur="2.94">they&amp;#39;ve been ordering all this they</text>
  <text start="1590.85" dur="5.01">tried to order this back in December</text>
  <text start="1592.47" dur="6.72">September 2012 they tried to order about</text>
  <text start="1595.86" dur="5.52">176 rounds but they at that time they</text>
  <text start="1599.19" dur="4.04">called it off because what everything</text>
  <text start="1601.38" dur="5.429">that was going on so here they are again</text>
  <text start="1603.23" dur="7.199">ordering sniper rounds because they need</text>
  <text start="1606.809" dur="7.671">to control the American people</text>
  <text start="1610.429" dur="7.47">okay now in out in Europe Spain and</text>
  <text start="1614.48" dur="6.139">turkey of course Spain you know is in a</text>
  <text start="1617.899" dur="6.6">depression they don&amp;#39;t have a recovery</text>
  <text start="1620.619" dur="7.69">turkey is their currency is crashing and</text>
  <text start="1624.499" dur="7.41">it&amp;#39;s at record lows and but Spain and</text>
  <text start="1628.309" dur="6.57">Turkey have decided to build an aircraft</text>
  <text start="1631.909" dur="5.97">carrier why are they doing this again it</text>
  <text start="1634.879" dur="5.37">is in preparation for World War three</text>
  <text start="1637.879" dur="5.701">they are starting construction they will</text>
  <text start="1640.249" dur="6.03">build a aircraft carrier and again all</text>
  <text start="1643.58" dur="5.13">military assets are being put in place</text>
  <text start="1646.279" dur="4.47">for World War 3 this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1648.71" dur="4.89">this happen this is why there&amp;#39;s a pivot</text>
  <text start="1650.749" dur="5.79">to Asia this is why Japan has built the</text>
  <text start="1653.6" dur="4.649">first warship since World War two this</text>
  <text start="1656.539" dur="4.98">is why the United States is moving the</text>
  <text start="1658.249" dur="5.16">base on Okinawa to a different location</text>
  <text start="1661.519" dur="5.54">so they can bring in more sophisticated</text>
  <text start="1663.409" dur="6.15">weapons this is why in Guam they</text>
  <text start="1667.059" dur="4.33">implemented a missile shield system</text>
  <text start="1669.559" dur="4.71">there this is why there&amp;#39;s a missile</text>
  <text start="1671.389" dur="4.5">shield in Europe they are doing this on</text>
  <text start="1674.269" dur="4.11">purpose is why I think it was a sixty</text>
  <text start="1675.889" dur="5.221">percent of the submarines or in the</text>
  <text start="1678.379" dur="4.29">Asian region and the aircraft carries</text>
  <text start="1681.11" dur="4.289">out a 12 of them I believe there&amp;#39;s ten</text>
  <text start="1682.669" dur="4.35">of them in the Pacific Asia area and</text>
  <text start="1685.399" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re doing this because they</text>
  <text start="1687.019" dur="4.02">understand that war is coming and</text>
  <text start="1689.299" dur="6.391">they&amp;#39;re moving all the military assets</text>
  <text start="1691.039" dur="6.661">to be in place for this war now the</text>
  <text start="1695.69" dur="4.92">State Department has issued a travel</text>
  <text start="1697.7" dur="5.88">advisory travel warning to Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="1700.61" dur="4.799">and again on the night of January</text>
  <text start="1703.58" dur="3.809">thirteenth unknown gunmen attacked the</text>
  <text start="1705.409" dur="3.75">vehicle of two German embassy officials</text>
  <text start="1707.389" dur="3.63">and right now the US government</text>
  <text start="1709.159" dur="3.691">personnel are prohibited from traveling</text>
  <text start="1711.019" dur="4.74">there and they&amp;#39;re recommending that US</text>
  <text start="1712.85" dur="4.86">citizens avoid the area as well usually</text>
  <text start="1715.759" dur="3.931">when they put these travel advisories up</text>
  <text start="1717.71" dur="4.11">something actually happens it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1719.69" dur="4.38">happen the next day just like we saw in</text>
  <text start="1721.82" dur="4.53">Sudan they put up the travel a warning</text>
  <text start="1724.07" dur="3.929">they started to remove people from the</text>
  <text start="1726.35" dur="4.289">embassy and then a couple weeks later</text>
  <text start="1727.999" dur="4.951">all of a sudden this civil war broke out</text>
  <text start="1730.639" dur="5.73">they just did a twig and ax there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1732.95" dur="6.359">there&amp;#39;s a terrorist watch warning there</text>
  <text start="1736.369" dur="5.16">now we see in Saudi Arabia so something</text>
  <text start="1739.309" dur="4.86">is definitely going on and this always</text>
  <text start="1741.529" dur="3.28">turns out to be bad for the whole entire</text>
  <text start="1744.169" dur="3.701">area</text>
  <text start="1744.809" dur="5.431">once they put up these warnings now we</text>
  <text start="1747.87" dur="4.11">understand that Iran and the United</text>
  <text start="1750.24" dur="6.149">States and many other countries have</text>
  <text start="1751.98" dur="7.35">created this peace deal document and</text>
  <text start="1756.389" dur="6.231">what&amp;#39;s strange about this document is</text>
  <text start="1759.33" dur="6.449">that it&amp;#39;s being shrouded in secrecy and</text>
  <text start="1762.62" dur="4.75">a leading house lawmaker is calling on</text>
  <text start="1765.779" dur="3.99">President Obama to publicly release the</text>
  <text start="1767.37" dur="4.259">full text of the recently son Iran</text>
  <text start="1769.769" dur="3.66">nuclear deal which is currently being</text>
  <text start="1771.629" dur="4.26">held under lock and key in a secure</text>
  <text start="1773.429" dur="6.24">compound on Capitol Hill now the</text>
  <text start="1775.889" dur="6.38">question is why is so secret what is in</text>
  <text start="1779.669" dur="5.821">there that they don&amp;#39;t want people to see</text>
  <text start="1782.269" dur="5.02">that is the big question I mean we can</text>
  <text start="1785.49" dur="4.86">make some guesses maybe it has to do</text>
  <text start="1787.289" dur="6.181">with how they&amp;#39;re going to take over or</text>
  <text start="1790.35" dur="6.6">maybe how they&amp;#39;re going to move into</text>
  <text start="1793.47" dur="5.22">these the central bank and put them on</text>
  <text start="1796.95" dur="4.439">the private western central bank system</text>
  <text start="1798.69" dur="5.219">or there could be other things that are</text>
  <text start="1801.389" dur="4.02">in this document and this goes on to say</text>
  <text start="1803.909" dur="3.11">that the precise details of the deal</text>
  <text start="1805.409" dur="3.811">have remained shrouded in secrecy</text>
  <text start="1807.019" dur="4.39">despite the critical nature of the</text>
  <text start="1809.22" dur="4.439">agreement and the secrecy surrounding</text>
  <text start="1811.409" dur="3.781">the deal has prevented Congress from</text>
  <text start="1813.659" dur="3.96">providing critical oversight on the</text>
  <text start="1815.19" dur="3.75">negotiations with Turan in order for</text>
  <text start="1817.619" dur="3.03">Congress to properly perform its</text>
  <text start="1818.94" dur="5.099">oversight functions and for the American</text>
  <text start="1820.649" dur="4.98">people and our allies to have full and</text>
  <text start="1824.039" dur="3.661">open debate on the issue I respectfully</text>
  <text start="1825.629" dur="4.62">request that you make public the full</text>
  <text start="1827.7" dur="7.949">text of the deal and the person who</text>
  <text start="1830.249" dur="9.211">wrote that was Ra&amp;#39;s listenin and it goes</text>
  <text start="1835.649" dur="5.941">in it goes on to say that people who</text>
  <text start="1839.46" dur="5.64">want to actually read the document they</text>
  <text start="1841.59" dur="5.909">need to have special access to the area</text>
  <text start="1845.1" dur="4.23">they can&amp;#39;t take any pictures of it they</text>
  <text start="1847.499" dur="4.321">have to leave all their phones they have</text>
  <text start="1849.33" dur="4.38">to have clearance and they can only read</text>
  <text start="1851.82" dur="5.099">the document and leave the document</text>
  <text start="1853.71" dur="5.549">there in a special room so it&amp;#39;s very odd</text>
  <text start="1856.919" dur="4.171">that they&amp;#39;re doing this so any time the</text>
  <text start="1859.259" dur="4.441">government is it has something that</text>

  <text start="1866.73" dur="4.679">that they&amp;#39;re doing is not legal and this</text>

  <text start="2180.92" dur="5.04">can use the UN they can try the war</text>

  <text start="2202.61" dur="4.83">actually no proof whatsoever and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2205.19" dur="3.45">why that whole thing falls fell apart so</text>
  <text start="2207.44" dur="2.46">what they&amp;#39;re going to have to do is</text>
  <text start="2208.64" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re going to have to take it to the</text>

  <text start="2419.599" dur="6.841">weapons they are definitely pushing this</text>
  <text start="2423.26" dur="5.66">agenda forward for the false flag event</text>
  <text start="2426.44" dur="4.86">the current instability in Syria</text>
  <text start="2428.92" dur="4.75">presents a perfect opportunity for al</text>

  <text start="2438.14" dur="5.13">what are they doing here well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2441.02" dur="5.16">doing two things they&amp;#39;re trying to build</text>
  <text start="2443.27" dur="5.4">the case where Syria is unstable that</text>

  <text start="2460.25" dur="5.91">do is they&amp;#39;re trying to bring this to</text>
  <text start="2463.07" dur="7.71">the UN and say we need to go into Syria</text>
