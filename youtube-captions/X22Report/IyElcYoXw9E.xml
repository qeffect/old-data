  <text start="105.27" dur="6.51">closer and closer to d-day where a lot</text>
  <text start="109.47" dur="6.569">of news is gonna come out a lot of</text>
  <text start="111.78" dur="5.819">things they&amp;#39;re gonna happen and everyone</text>
  <text start="116.039" dur="3.36">needs to be ready and prepared for this</text>
  <text start="117.599" dur="4.101">we talked about this in many many</text>
  <text start="119.399" dur="5.041">reports but it looks like at this point</text>
  <text start="121.7" dur="4.809">anything is fair game and we know the</text>
  <text start="124.44" dur="6.5">economy has been built up on a gigantic</text>
  <text start="126.509" dur="8.251">illusion we know that this entire system</text>
  <text start="130.94" dur="6.4">was propped up since 2008 when the</text>
  <text start="134.76" dur="6.54">entire system crashed and they needed</text>
  <text start="137.34" dur="6.33">the ability to create currency to allow</text>
  <text start="141.3" dur="4.92">them to do what they needed to do to</text>
  <text start="143.67" dur="3.39">bring us to war to cover up for the</text>
  <text start="146.22" dur="5.19">major collapse</text>
  <text start="147.06" dur="8.37">that&amp;#39;s what 2008 was about it was a it</text>
  <text start="151.41" dur="7.95">was a process of where the central bank</text>
  <text start="155.43" dur="7.38">brought the system down so they can get</text>
  <text start="159.36" dur="6.959">the government to allow them to create</text>
  <text start="162.81" dur="6.99">currency willy-nilly and this way they</text>
  <text start="166.319" dur="6.45">can prop the entire world up long enough</text>
  <text start="169.8" dur="5.12">for them to get the event started so</text>
  <text start="172.769" dur="5.22">they can cover up the major collapse</text>
  <text start="174.92" dur="5.319">because without doing that the entire</text>
  <text start="177.989" dur="5.731">system would have imploded right there</text>
  <text start="180.239" dur="6.001">and then the problem right now is that</text>
  <text start="183.72" dur="3.69">their plans have been flushed down the</text>
  <text start="186.24" dur="3.9">toilet</text>
  <text start="187.41" dur="6.69">the people that they needed in place to</text>
  <text start="190.14" dur="6.9">pull this off are not there this is the</text>
  <text start="194.1" dur="5.46">major problem and when we look at the</text>
  <text start="197.04" dur="6">major economy in the United States and</text>
  <text start="199.56" dur="6.93">globally it is falling apart left and</text>
  <text start="203.04" dur="6.51">right and what&amp;#39;s very concerning is that</text>
  <text start="206.49" dur="6.03">people have saved their whole lives have</text>
  <text start="209.55" dur="5.52">put money into pensions they invested</text>
  <text start="212.52" dur="4.55">and they&amp;#39;ve been kept in this</text>
  <text start="215.07" dur="4.77">illusionary world for such a long time</text>
  <text start="217.07" dur="4.81">they don&amp;#39;t realize what is happening</text>
  <text start="219.84" dur="4.95">right now I mean if we look at the</text>
  <text start="221.88" dur="6.15">pension system for it for example right</text>
  <text start="224.79" dur="5.19">now the pensions are about 7 trillion</text>
  <text start="228.03" dur="4.29">short of the funding they need to pay</text>
  <text start="229.98" dur="5.31">out all the benefits they promised and</text>
  <text start="232.32" dur="5.48">that doesn&amp;#39;t include the 49 trillion in</text>
  <text start="235.29" dur="5.04">unfunded Social Security obligations</text>
  <text start="237.8" dur="4.66">private pensions are in bad shape too</text>
  <text start="240.33" dur="4.47">let&amp;#39;s take a look at that a total of</text>
  <text start="242.46" dur="6.39">around 1,400 corporate pensions are a</text>
  <text start="244.8" dur="6">combined 553 billion in the hole plus 25</text>
  <text start="248.85" dur="4.41">percent of those funds are expected to</text>
  <text start="250.8" dur="5.28">go broke in the next decade but the</text>
  <text start="253.26" dur="5.97">pension problem is much much bigger than</text>
  <text start="256.08" dur="5.13">just what&amp;#39;s happening even though the</text>
  <text start="259.23" dur="4.83">u.s. problems are very severe but if we</text>
  <text start="261.21" dur="6.9">look at the worldwide problems well it</text>
  <text start="264.06" dur="6.09">looks like that&amp;#39;s even worse in 2015 the</text>
  <text start="268.11" dur="5.1">total worldwide gap in pension funding</text>
  <text start="270.15" dur="4.68">was around 70 trillion and this is</text>
  <text start="273.21" dur="5.01">according to the World Economic Forum</text>
  <text start="274.83" dur="6.68">that is larger than the 20 largest</text>
  <text start="278.22" dur="5.76">economies in the world combined</text>
  <text start="281.51" dur="4.42">so what are they going to do about all</text>
  <text start="283.98" dur="4.47">of this well one of the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.93" dur="5.67">proposals is to slash retirement</text>
  <text start="288.45" dur="5.27">payments by 10 percent at the same time</text>
  <text start="291.6" dur="6.81">the government wants to increase</text>
  <text start="293.72" dur="8.23">contributions by adding more in taxes</text>
  <text start="298.41" dur="5.64">maybe by 50 percent to allow those that</text>
  <text start="301.95" dur="4.38">are going to retire enough for them to</text>
  <text start="304.05" dur="4.92">retire just to cover them and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="306.33" dur="5.7">worry about everyone else later on this</text>
  <text start="308.97" dur="6.15">is not going to work see the problem is</text>
  <text start="312.03" dur="7.32">is that this entire system has been</text>
  <text start="315.12" dur="6.18">built on a central bank platform where</text>
  <text start="319.35" dur="3.599">you create currency you attach</text>
  <text start="321.3" dur="4.53">interest to it and of course this is</text>
  <text start="322.949" dur="6.451">create out of thin air you loan it to</text>
  <text start="325.83" dur="6.36">the government and the government has no</text>
  <text start="329.4" dur="4.889">checks and balances so they start</text>
  <text start="332.19" dur="4.74">programs up they start entitlement</text>
  <text start="334.289" dur="5.521">programs a lot of the money is siphoned</text>
  <text start="336.93" dur="5.73">off someplace else the military gets</text>
  <text start="339.81" dur="4.979">larger and the tax receipts that are</text>
  <text start="342.66" dur="4.2">coming into the government they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="344.789" dur="4.261">enough for all these programs that they</text>
  <text start="346.86" dur="4.11">started so what do they do they have to</text>
  <text start="349.05" dur="4.589">borrow more and of course there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="350.97" dur="5.28">interest attached to that who pays for</text>
  <text start="353.639" dur="5.37">all this well the people that are</text>
  <text start="356.25" dur="6.06">working and that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re taxed to</text>
  <text start="359.009" dur="6.601">pay for all this debt and this process</text>
  <text start="362.31" dur="5.07">continues on over and over and over it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="365.61" dur="4.589">like a household that has a credit card</text>
  <text start="367.38" dur="4.08">that&amp;#39;s making $50,000 a year yeah maybe</text>
  <text start="370.199" dur="4.381">they&amp;#39;re getting raises maybe they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="371.46" dur="5.79">maybe they get in cost-of-living but the</text>
  <text start="374.58" dur="5.28">amount that they&amp;#39;re spending is about 10</text>
  <text start="377.25" dur="4.68">20 30 40 times than what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="379.86" dur="5.01">bringing in you know what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="381.93" dur="4.979">happen eventually they won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="384.87" dur="4.59">pay the interest on the debt they have</text>
  <text start="386.909" dur="5.01">to go bankrupt that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="389.46" dur="5.76">in this country right now the central</text>
  <text start="391.919" dur="5.43">banking system doesn&amp;#39;t last forever just</text>
  <text start="395.22" dur="4.169">like borrowing on your credit card with</text>
  <text start="397.349" dur="4.471">an income about fifty thousand if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="399.389" dur="4.71">think about it if your wage goes down</text>
  <text start="401.82" dur="3.45">and your employer says listen instead of</text>
  <text start="404.099" dur="2.94">fifty thousand you could be making forty</text>
  <text start="405.27" dur="3.42">five thousand now or they keep it at</text>
  <text start="407.039" dur="3.841">fifty thousand but everything else is</text>
  <text start="408.69" dur="5.67">getting more expensive you know what</text>
  <text start="410.88" dur="4.92">happens you go into bankruptcy there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="414.36" dur="4.23">nothing else you try to get another job</text>
  <text start="415.8" dur="4.5">but then you spend more money everything</text>
  <text start="418.59" dur="4.079">continually gets more expensive you</text>
  <text start="420.3" dur="5.01">can&amp;#39;t keep up that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="422.669" dur="5.25">right now now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is</text>
  <text start="425.31" dur="4.05">that we know that the Fed they want to</text>
  <text start="427.919" dur="4.111">raise rates and I do believe that Powell</text>
  <text start="429.36" dur="6.359">and Trump he put Powell into position on</text>
  <text start="432.03" dur="5.91">purpose and he knew that Powell was</text>
  <text start="435.719" dur="3.961">going to raise rates and of course he</text>
  <text start="437.94" dur="2.94">made the comment that he&amp;#39;s and he</text>
  <text start="439.68" dur="5.1">thought it was gonna be an easy money</text>
  <text start="440.88" dur="5.759">type of Fed but he knew that to destroy</text>
  <text start="444.78" dur="3.449">the economy the rates have to move up</text>
  <text start="446.639" dur="2.971">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is the</text>
  <text start="448.229" dur="3.481">corporate media is out there and they</text>
  <text start="449.61" dur="3.21">always defend the Fed because you know</text>
  <text start="451.71" dur="2.05">they&amp;#39;re working hand in hand with the</text>
  <text start="452.82" dur="4.47">Fed</text>
  <text start="453.76" dur="6.06">this is part of the deep state funding</text>
  <text start="457.29" dur="5.23">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="459.82" dur="4.83">putting out articles and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="462.52" dur="3.78">that listen the yield curve is</text>
  <text start="464.65" dur="4.95">suggesting that we&amp;#39;re heading towards a</text>
  <text start="466.3" dur="6.24">recession and now is the time for the</text>
  <text start="469.6" dur="6.36">Fed to stabilize interest rates there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="472.54" dur="6.06">no need to raise them any more now this</text>
  <text start="475.96" dur="5.73">is very interesting they&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="478.6" dur="4.62">telling the Fed listen don&amp;#39;t raise the</text>
  <text start="481.69" dur="3.93">rates anymore because it&amp;#39;s going to hurt</text>
  <text start="483.22" dur="5.58">the economy because they know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="485.62" dur="5.07">happening here they know if the Fed and</text>
  <text start="488.8" dur="4.02">we talked about this yesterday if they</text>
  <text start="490.69" dur="4.98">raise it two more times and it gets very</text>
  <text start="492.82" dur="6.39">close to three percent the economy will</text>
  <text start="495.67" dur="8.67">implode on itself now the Fed has come</text>
  <text start="499.21" dur="9.54">out and they have said that they are not</text>
  <text start="504.34" dur="7.62">prepared for the next crisis the Fed</text>
  <text start="508.75" dur="6.39">said to be more unprepared for crisis</text>
  <text start="511.96" dur="5.58">than ten years ago and what does that</text>
  <text start="515.14" dur="6.81">tell you that tells you that their</text>
  <text start="517.54" dur="5.91">system is done for because they have no</text>
  <text start="521.95" dur="2.85">way out of this they knew this from the</text>
  <text start="523.45" dur="4.5">beginning when they started to create</text>
  <text start="524.8" dur="5.49">the funds back in 2008 when they when</text>
  <text start="527.95" dur="4.23">they you know manufactured the collapse</text>
  <text start="530.29" dur="4.56">of the system and they had the</text>
  <text start="532.18" dur="4.77">government passed laws where all of a</text>
  <text start="534.85" dur="5.97">sudden they were able to do things that</text>
  <text start="536.95" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;ve never were able to do before now</text>
  <text start="540.82" dur="4.29">a group of current and former policy</text>
  <text start="542.83" dur="4.2">makers and academics in the financial</text>
  <text start="545.11" dur="4.44">industry that comprised of the group of</text>
  <text start="547.03" dur="4.61">30 a Financial Industry working group</text>
  <text start="549.55" dur="6.15">that includes names like Mario Draghi</text>
  <text start="551.64" dur="7.48">Mark Carney and many others you know the</text>
  <text start="555.7" dur="6.18">who&amp;#39;s who of who these individuals are</text>
  <text start="559.12" dur="5.76">saying listen we&amp;#39;re not prepared for</text>
  <text start="561.88" dur="6.15">this next crisis if there is a crisis</text>
  <text start="564.88" dur="6.39">which there will be we won&amp;#39;t be able to</text>
  <text start="568.03" dur="7.05">do anything the Fed is going to be in a</text>
  <text start="571.27" dur="6.12">worse position they&amp;#39;re in worse shape to</text>
  <text start="575.08" dur="6.21">fight the next major crisis than they</text>
  <text start="577.39" dur="6.39">were in 2008 now we all knew this we</text>
  <text start="581.29" dur="6.389">knew that what they were planning on was</text>
  <text start="583.78" dur="7.499">to have an event have something lar</text>
  <text start="587.679" dur="6.9">where they were going to cover all of</text>
  <text start="591.279" dur="6.84">this up so we can see right now at this</text>
  <text start="594.579" dur="7.41">point what is happening right now</text>
  <text start="598.119" dur="6.75">Trump is maneuvering to control the</text>
  <text start="601.989" dur="5.55">narrative not just Trump but all those</text>
  <text start="604.869" dur="5.55">people have been working with him and he</text>
  <text start="607.539" dur="5.22">has two narratives right now one if the</text>
  <text start="610.419" dur="4.051">Fed does raise the rates what&amp;#39;s the most</text>
  <text start="612.759" dur="6.6">likely they&amp;#39;re going to do the system</text>
  <text start="614.47" dur="8.509">will implode if news is released and the</text>
  <text start="619.359" dur="7.29">economy goes by the wayside guess what</text>
  <text start="622.979" dur="6.28">well the news took it down the economy</text>
  <text start="626.649" dur="5.31">was doing well it&amp;#39;s because of what</text>
  <text start="629.259" dur="6.03">these individuals have done over time</text>
  <text start="631.959" dur="6.42">and we found out and the people are not</text>
  <text start="635.289" dur="4.32">happy with this so right now he does</text>
  <text start="638.379" dur="4.68">have the ability to control the</text>
  <text start="639.609" dur="6.99">narrative and bring this system into a</text>
  <text start="643.059" dur="5.96">completely different area and this is</text>
  <text start="646.599" dur="5.97">what we&amp;#39;re seeing play out right now and</text>
  <text start="649.019" dur="5.201">within the next couple of days we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="652.569" dur="4.17">going to see the first part of the</text>
  <text start="654.22" dur="5.609">narrative most likely come out we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="656.739" dur="5.19">have to see what comes out how it</text>
  <text start="659.829" dur="4.11">affects the economy I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="661.929" dur="4.44">gonna be everything but eventually</text>
  <text start="663.939" dur="4.411">what&amp;#39;s going to happen people are gonna</text>
  <text start="666.369" dur="3.18">start to wonder they&amp;#39;re gonna scratch</text>
  <text start="668.35" dur="3.389">their heads they&amp;#39;re gonna think to</text>
  <text start="669.549" dur="3.75">themselves what&amp;#39;s going on here and all</text>
  <text start="671.739" dur="3.481">of a sudden you&amp;#39;re gonna see the</text>
  <text start="673.299" dur="4.89">mainstream media scrambling to explain</text>
