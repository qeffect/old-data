  <text start="42.2" dur="6.539">are now turning on the US let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="46.01" dur="5.28">the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="48.739" dur="5.371">geopolitical news now the US government</text>
  <text start="51.29" dur="5.79">and their alphabet agencies the FBI NSA</text>
  <text start="54.11" dur="5.519">CIA and many others have been spying on</text>
  <text start="57.08" dur="5.45">the American people for a very long time</text>
  <text start="59.629" dur="5.551">and they don&amp;#39;t even care if they violate</text>
  <text start="62.53" dur="5.98">the people&amp;#39;s rights they just don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="65.18" dur="5.19">and they use many different tactics and</text>
  <text start="68.51" dur="4.2">different ways to spy on the people and</text>
  <text start="70.37" dur="4.859">the FBI has been using a device called</text>
  <text start="72.71" dur="5.31">stingray we discussed this in prior</text>
  <text start="75.229" dur="5.131">reports and they pretended that it</text>
  <text start="78.02" dur="5.43">didn&amp;#39;t exist they said no we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="80.36" dur="6.36">using it no police forces aren&amp;#39;t using</text>
  <text start="83.45" dur="5.43">it if the judge asked you know to</text>
  <text start="86.72" dur="5.49">present the Stingray device how does it</text>
  <text start="88.88" dur="6.87">work they drop the case against whoever</text>
  <text start="92.21" dur="8.61">they had something on and finally the</text>
  <text start="95.75" dur="10.59">FBI has admitted that yes they are using</text>
  <text start="100.82" dur="8.64">stingray devices and yes they do spy on</text>
  <text start="106.34" dur="7.53">the people and yes they do hack</text>
  <text start="109.46" dur="7.89">computers software and they get</text>
  <text start="113.87" dur="8.67">information off of people&amp;#39;s phones PCs</text>
  <text start="117.35" dur="12.8">and everything else and this is coming</text>
  <text start="122.54" dur="13.229">from amy hess who basically is the</text>
  <text start="130.15" dur="9.28">director of all of this and christopher</text>
  <text start="135.769" dur="6.11">so so go hian the principal technologist</text>
  <text start="139.43" dur="7.619">at the American Civil Liberties Union</text>
  <text start="141.879" dur="7.901">has said this is high-tech and creepy</text>
  <text start="147.049" dur="6.33">it&amp;#39;s happening in the operational</text>
  <text start="149.78" dur="6.929">technology division of the FBI and the</text>
  <text start="153.379" dur="6.69">one who is basically overseeing this is</text>
  <text start="156.709" dur="7.021">Amy Hess and he calls amy has the queen</text>
  <text start="160.069" dur="7.261">of domestic surveillance</text>
  <text start="163.73" dur="5.789">and she has admitted that yes they use</text>
  <text start="167.33" dur="4.59">the Stingray to mimic cell phone towers</text>
  <text start="169.519" dur="5.521">to trick other cell phones into</text>
  <text start="171.92" dur="6.709">connecting to them and equally troubling</text>
  <text start="175.04" dur="7.199">is the bureau&amp;#39;s use of the zero-day</text>
  <text start="178.629" dur="7.091">exploits a malware that attacks code to</text>
  <text start="182.239" dur="5.58">exploit vulnerabilities often unknown by</text>
  <text start="185.72" dur="5.579">the company or organization or the</text>
  <text start="187.819" dur="11.461">person and it basically what it does is</text>
  <text start="191.299" dur="9.991">it accesses the systems and basically</text>
  <text start="199.28" dur="5.19">they can go in and poke around in the</text>
  <text start="201.29" dur="4.71">system the FBI also admits that yes</text>
  <text start="204.47" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re using facial and iris</text>
  <text start="206" dur="6.51">recognition without any type of limits</text>
  <text start="209.03" dur="5.25">or restrictions and basically they use</text>
  <text start="212.51" dur="4.319">this for all their surveillance and yes</text>
  <text start="214.28" dur="5.429">they are capturing ordinary everyday</text>
  <text start="216.829" dur="5.55">citizens and they&amp;#39;re keeping all this</text>
  <text start="219.709" dur="7.981">information now I said this before and</text>
  <text start="222.379" dur="8.101">this is a solution how do we basically</text>
  <text start="227.69" dur="5.79">show the government that we are</text>
  <text start="230.48" dur="5.849">supporting our rights the Fourth</text>
  <text start="233.48" dur="5.39">Amendment the First Amendment well we</text>
  <text start="236.329" dur="7.051">show them that we&amp;#39;re going to block them</text>
  <text start="238.87" dur="8.31">you cannot spy on us we do this in many</text>
  <text start="243.38" dur="6.68">different ways we use heavy encryption</text>
  <text start="247.18" dur="4.98">encryption not known to the government</text>
  <text start="250.06" dur="4.959">someone created an open source</text>
  <text start="252.16" dur="3.97">encryption key which is on my site if</text>
  <text start="255.019" dur="4.351">you scroll down you&amp;#39;ll see it on the</text>
  <text start="256.13" dur="5.639">right hand side it&amp;#39;s called PI it&amp;#39;s open</text>
  <text start="259.37" dur="5.37">source code you can use start page which</text>
  <text start="261.769" dur="7.191">hides your searches actually uses proxy</text>
  <text start="264.74" dur="7.71">servers to hide your location you can</text>
  <text start="268.96" dur="5.829">spend money on encrypted email services</text>
  <text start="272.45" dur="4.68">a lot of times during this year they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="274.789" dur="4.531">running Christmas specials and I want</text>
  <text start="277.13" dur="4.71">you to do is go into into start page</text>
  <text start="279.32" dur="5.909">notice how I didn&amp;#39;t say Google go into</text>
  <text start="281.84" dur="10.17">start page and type in encrypted email</text>
  <text start="285.229" dur="9.961">services find one make sure that this is</text>
  <text start="292.01" dur="5.84">not a government back type of service</text>
  <text start="295.19" dur="4.86">and you can find out by</text>
  <text start="297.85" dur="5.379">going on to all different sites and</text>
  <text start="300.05" dur="5.13">looking at it you can use products like</text>
  <text start="303.229" dur="5.16">block it pocket which is applaud coat</text>
  <text start="305.18" dur="4.98">pocket calm for your credit cards then</text>
  <text start="308.389" dur="3.571">have those chips in them your license</text>
  <text start="310.16" dur="3.539">which is going to be real ID which will</text>
  <text start="311.96" dur="5.519">eventually have the RFID chip in there</text>
  <text start="313.699" dur="6.151">your cell phone your iPad you can your</text>
  <text start="317.479" dur="5.071">laptop you can slide this into the</text>
  <text start="319.85" dur="5.539">sleeve its interwoven with metal like</text>
  <text start="322.55" dur="5.19">silver copper it blocks the signal it</text>
  <text start="325.389" dur="5.381">stops people with scanners who are</text>
  <text start="327.74" dur="5.58">walking by you to steal the credit card</text>
  <text start="330.77" dur="5.19">information off of you so there are</text>
  <text start="333.32" dur="6.51">different ways of protecting yourself</text>
  <text start="335.96" dur="6.09">and I mentioned this before there was a</text>
  <text start="339.83" dur="4.92">there is a judge in the Northern</text>
  <text start="342.05" dur="5.64">District of Illinois that is putting a</text>
  <text start="344.75" dur="5.22">stop to all of this and basically says</text>
  <text start="347.69" dur="5.58">listen there are three rules that they</text>
  <text start="349.97" dur="6.87">have to follow prosecutors cannot use</text>
  <text start="353.27" dur="5.79">devices in this area especially when</text>
  <text start="356.84" dur="5.37">there&amp;#39;s an inordinate number of innocent</text>
  <text start="359.06" dur="7.02">third parties and they can&amp;#39;t collect it</text>
  <text start="362.21" dur="5.429">and if they do collect any of it they</text>
  <text start="366.08" dur="4.649">need to adhere to the Fourth Amendment</text>
  <text start="367.639" dur="6.361">and immediately destroy the information</text>
  <text start="370.729" dur="5.131">within 48 hours and then they have to</text>
  <text start="374" dur="4.26">show proof that they actually did</text>
  <text start="375.86" dur="4.98">destroy this information to the judge</text>
  <text start="378.26" dur="5.73">now of course this is a judge in a</text>
  <text start="380.84" dur="6.87">localized area but we shouldn&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="383.99" dur="6.149">do this we should have the entire</text>
  <text start="387.71" dur="5.7">country and our government employees</text>
  <text start="390.139" dur="5.551">saying yes this is how it should be all</text>
  <text start="393.41" dur="6.439">the time because you are violating the</text>
  <text start="395.69" dur="6.659">people&amp;#39;s rights now the government</text>
  <text start="399.849" dur="7.331">continually wants to spy on the people</text>
  <text start="402.349" dur="6.661">and what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="407.18" dur="4.709">to pass certain laws like cissa for</text>
  <text start="409.01" dur="5.189">instance which allows the government to</text>
  <text start="411.889" dur="9.451">take your information from corporations</text>
  <text start="414.199" dur="9.09">like AT&amp;amp;T verizon google apple and it</text>
  <text start="421.34" dur="3.81">will hold them liable so basically what</text>
  <text start="423.289" dur="4.861">they&amp;#39;re doing is they created the USA</text>
  <text start="425.15" dur="4.86">Freedom Act which says the corporations</text>
  <text start="428.15" dur="3.33">will be collecting this information</text>
  <text start="430.01" dur="4.8">which they do any</text>
  <text start="431.48" dur="6.09">how and the NSA won&amp;#39;t be collecting but</text>
  <text start="434.81" dur="5.97">in reality they still are they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="437.57" dur="6.27">really dismantled anything and with</text>
  <text start="440.78" dur="6.56">cissa it will allow the government the</text>
  <text start="443.84" dur="6.11">alphabet agencies to take this data and</text>
  <text start="447.34" dur="6.22">the companies will not be held liable</text>
  <text start="449.95" dur="6.78">they&amp;#39;re off the hook they also want</text>
  <text start="453.56" dur="6.93">certain companies to be free speech</text>
  <text start="456.73" dur="7.06">police right now lawmakers they have</text>
  <text start="460.49" dur="5.4">resurrected a legislation that would</text>
  <text start="463.79" dur="5.43">require tech companies social media</text>
  <text start="465.89" dur="9.39">companies to report online terrorist</text>
  <text start="469.22" dur="9.96">activity we the requiring reporting of</text>
  <text start="475.28" dur="6.75">online terrorist activity act basically</text>
  <text start="479.18" dur="5.81">like I said all of these titles to these</text>
  <text start="482.03" dur="8.16">bills are always the opposite basically</text>
  <text start="484.99" dur="11.2">what they want to do is create a police</text>
  <text start="490.19" dur="10.2">force to police the certain speech</text>
  <text start="496.19" dur="7.85">people are using on social media that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="500.39" dur="6.69">what they&amp;#39;re doing but Senator Ron Wyden</text>
  <text start="504.04" dur="5.5">put a hold on this bill in the past and</text>
  <text start="507.08" dur="5.49">he criticized the bill because</text>
  <text start="509.54" dur="4.5">everything is vaguely defined and he</text>
  <text start="512.57" dur="3.36">says social media companies aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="514.04" dur="3.78">qualified to judge which post amount to</text>
  <text start="515.93" dur="4.52">terrorist activities and they shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="517.82" dur="7.14">be forced against their will to create</text>
  <text start="520.45" dur="6.79">basically a Bureau of Investigation to</text>
  <text start="524.96" dur="5.85">police their users and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="527.24" dur="7.2">saying on their accounts now a lot of</text>
  <text start="530.81" dur="5.99">these companies do this already we know</text>
  <text start="534.44" dur="4.43">Facebook does we know YouTube does</text>
  <text start="536.8" dur="6.58">because there are certain videos that</text>
  <text start="538.87" dur="6.31">basically are brought down certain</text>
  <text start="543.38" dur="5.82">filters that are set up that block</text>
  <text start="545.18" dur="8.01">certain things and we know the</text>
  <text start="549.2" dur="6.81">government what they want is basically</text>
  <text start="553.19" dur="3.75">the control of information and this is</text>
  <text start="556.01" dur="2.82">what they&amp;#39;re doing because they have a</text>
  <text start="556.94" dur="5.76">corporate media in their back pockets</text>
  <text start="558.83" dur="6.66">the Internet the alternative media new</text>
  <text start="562.7" dur="5.579">media is a different story and there</text>
  <text start="565.49" dur="4.92">trying to gain control of this because</text>
  <text start="568.279" dur="6.211">right now the central bankers have the</text>
  <text start="570.41" dur="8.4">creation of money they have the control</text>
  <text start="574.49" dur="7.65">of the media except for the internet and</text>
  <text start="578.81" dur="6.81">the alternative media and the last thing</text>
  <text start="582.14" dur="6.9">they really need is the weapons from the</text>
  <text start="585.62" dur="6.36">people to leave them disarmed and this</text>
  <text start="589.04" dur="6.08">way they can close down the society they</text>
  <text start="591.98" dur="6.99">can control everything at this point and</text>
  <text start="595.12" dur="5.56">this is their whole mission and this is</text>
  <text start="598.97" dur="4.08">what they&amp;#39;re trying to do now the EU</text>
  <text start="600.68" dur="6.44">Parliament president is getting very</text>
  <text start="603.05" dur="7.17">very nervous because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="607.12" dur="5.62">countries to think on their own they</text>
  <text start="610.22" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t want them to decide if border</text>
  <text start="612.74" dur="3.51">should be open or closed because this</text>
  <text start="615.08" dur="5.069">doesn&amp;#39;t fit into the one world</text>
  <text start="616.25" dur="7.38">government and right now we see the EU</text>
  <text start="620.149" dur="6.331">Parliament president insists the fall of</text>
  <text start="623.63" dur="6.209">the EU and return to nation based</text>
  <text start="626.48" dur="6.359">thinking will become a disaster for</text>
  <text start="629.839" dur="5.911">Europe no country alone can handle</text>
  <text start="632.839" dur="5.281">changes such as migration climate change</text>
  <text start="635.75" dur="6.12">terrorism trade an international crime</text>
  <text start="638.12" dur="5.459">we must do it together the retreat of</text>
  <text start="641.87" dur="6.57">many governments into nation based</text>
  <text start="643.579" dur="6.51">thinking is fatal well each nation can</text>
  <text start="648.44" dur="4.56">think on their own each nation can do</text>
  <text start="650.089" dur="6.961">what&amp;#39;s best for their people and they</text>
  <text start="653" dur="6.649">can also work with the EU but if it</text>
  <text start="657.05" dur="5.49">doesn&amp;#39;t benefit the country itself</text>
  <text start="659.649" dur="5.351">there&amp;#39;s a problem but they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="662.54" dur="8.43">this to happen they want full control of</text>
  <text start="665" dur="8.579">what is going on now out in Ukraine we</text>
  <text start="670.97" dur="5.28">see the death toll passes 9,000 people</text>
  <text start="673.579" dur="4.291">there&amp;#39;s about 20,000 people injured and</text>
  <text start="676.25" dur="4.14">this is coming from a UN report which</text>
  <text start="677.87" dur="5.25">was put out today and we understand</text>
  <text start="680.39" dur="4.11">after the coup d&amp;#39;etat where the US came</text>
  <text start="683.12" dur="5.49">in through out the elected government</text>
  <text start="684.5" dur="7.95">and put in a puppet government we saw</text>
  <text start="688.61" dur="6.93">that John Kerry Joe Biden quickly got</text>
  <text start="692.45" dur="5.95">family and friends into key positions in</text>
  <text start="695.54" dur="5.32">the gas companies in Ukraine for</text>
  <text start="698.4" dur="4.2">since hunter who&amp;#39;s a lawyer and investor</text>
  <text start="700.86" dur="3.57">became the director of one of the</text>
  <text start="702.6" dur="3.66">Ukrainian gas firms and right now</text>
  <text start="704.43" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re being investigated by Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="706.26" dur="7.17">authorities and British authorities</text>
  <text start="707.88" dur="9.05">about what just exactly happened in this</text>
  <text start="713.43" dur="7.05">scenario now it&amp;#39;s very strange that</text>
  <text start="716.93" dur="6.1">there would be a basically overthrow of</text>
  <text start="720.48" dur="6.39">the elected government and what is it</text>
  <text start="723.03" dur="7.44">like a month later we see that Biden and</text>
  <text start="726.87" dur="7.56">Carrie bring in a family member a friend</text>
  <text start="730.47" dur="7.83">and they&amp;#39;re put on a board of directors</text>
  <text start="734.43" dur="6.45">for gas companies I mean this whole</text>
  <text start="738.3" dur="7.7">entire thing was completely planned and</text>
  <text start="740.88" dur="10.29">the plan went south now out in Yemen</text>
  <text start="746" dur="7.39">we&amp;#39;ve seen different things occur we</text>
  <text start="751.17" dur="3.21">know that Saudi Arabia which is the</text>
  <text start="753.39" dur="2.07">proxy army for the night States</text>
  <text start="754.38" dur="4.02">government central bankers are</text>
  <text start="755.46" dur="7.2">continually bombing Yemen but Yemen is</text>
  <text start="758.4" dur="7.2">making incredible moves and pushing the</text>
  <text start="762.66" dur="7.41">Saudi troops back and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="765.6" dur="9.27">finding there were seven mercenaries</text>
  <text start="770.07" dur="8.04">that were killed that were on the side</text>
  <text start="774.87" dur="6.45">of Saudi Arabia and when we looked into</text>
  <text start="778.11" dur="5.91">this we see that there are Latin</text>
  <text start="781.32" dur="4.44">American mercenaries that are leaving</text>
  <text start="784.02" dur="5.22">the ranks of the national armies of</text>
  <text start="785.76" dur="6.06">their countries to fight in the deserts</text>
  <text start="789.24" dur="5.82">of Yemen and they&amp;#39;re wearing the uniform</text>
  <text start="791.82" dur="5.67">of United Arab Emirates they have been</text>
