  <text start="64.089" dur="5.78">episode is we are witnessing the nation</text>
  <text start="66.7" dur="5.49">being prepared for a new economic system</text>
  <text start="69.869" dur="5.261">let&amp;#39;s get into the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="72.19" dur="5.42">financial news now we need to understand</text>
  <text start="75.13" dur="6">one thing that is pretty darn important</text>
  <text start="77.61" dur="6.63">this entire system is going to be coming</text>
  <text start="81.13" dur="6.599">down and it&amp;#39;s being prepped right now in</text>
  <text start="84.24" dur="6.189">a certain way to allow the United States</text>
  <text start="87.729" dur="6.45">to move forward after it the central</text>
  <text start="90.429" dur="6.931">banking system is gone they take it over</text>
  <text start="94.179" dur="6.271">they nationalize a Federal Reserve no</text>
  <text start="97.36" dur="5.06">longer independent and the people</text>
  <text start="100.45" dur="5.16">control it it&amp;#39;s completely transparent</text>
  <text start="102.42" dur="6.19">there&amp;#39;s no more loaning currency to the</text>
  <text start="105.61" dur="5.49">government where the people have to pay</text>
  <text start="108.61" dur="6.36">it back so what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="111.1" dur="7.229">is every step that Trump is taking it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="114.97" dur="5.37">preparing the economy for this this is</text>
  <text start="118.329" dur="4.921">not for this economy that we&amp;#39;re in right</text>
  <text start="120.34" dur="5.459">now where we see him talking about</text>
  <text start="123.25" dur="5.579">manufacturing talking about bilateral</text>
  <text start="125.799" dur="5.25">trade agreements talking about how great</text>
  <text start="128.829" dur="5.371">the economy&amp;#39;s doing the reason why the</text>
  <text start="131.049" dur="6.72">economy is doing well is he&amp;#39;s using the</text>
  <text start="134.2" dur="6.289">same exact approach the deep state the</text>
  <text start="137.769" dur="7.021">central bankers have used all along</text>
  <text start="140.489" dur="9.041">manipulation and he&amp;#39;s manipulating this</text>
  <text start="144.79" dur="8.13">economy and using it to allow the</text>
  <text start="149.53" dur="5.22">country to prepare for the next system I</text>
  <text start="152.92" dur="4.409">mean really think about it if he came</text>
  <text start="154.75" dur="5.28">out and he said the economy is dead in</text>
  <text start="157.329" dur="5.371">the water the stock market is fake it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="160.03" dur="5.34">fictitious it&amp;#39;s a bubble it&amp;#39;s gonna pop</text>
  <text start="162.7" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s being driven higher and higher by</text>
  <text start="165.37" dur="4.26">the Fed all the numbers that were</text>
  <text start="167.98" dur="3.509">reporting on are completely fake phony</text>
  <text start="169.63" dur="4.229">and false what would happen right now</text>
  <text start="171.489" dur="4.801">well first of all the economy is not</text>
  <text start="173.859" dur="5.401">prepared for anything it would just</text>
  <text start="176.29" dur="4.86">collapse people would be freaked out why</text>
  <text start="179.26" dur="6.24">is this happening why is this all</text>
  <text start="181.15" dur="5.52">manipulated and the US would take years</text>
  <text start="185.5" dur="7.65">upon years</text>
  <text start="186.67" dur="10.11">to recover instead let&amp;#39;s drive these</text>
  <text start="193.15" dur="7.02">numbers up higher and push this economy</text>
  <text start="196.78" dur="5.4">to the edge using the central bank and</text>
  <text start="200.17" dur="4.56">the deep state and what they&amp;#39;ve done in</text>
  <text start="202.18" dur="5.76">the past and that is what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="204.73" dur="6.06">right now he is using this saying that</text>
  <text start="207.94" dur="7.11">it&amp;#39;s doing fantastically which enables</text>
  <text start="210.79" dur="7.32">him to take funds use it for</text>
  <text start="215.05" dur="6.75">infrastructure he has the ability now to</text>
  <text start="218.11" dur="6.66">make the bilateral trade agreements to</text>
  <text start="221.8" dur="6.18">say the u.s. is doing well so we can</text>
  <text start="224.77" dur="5.31">make these agreements and he&amp;#39;s using all</text>
  <text start="227.98" dur="5.16">of this not just him but those people</text>
  <text start="230.08" dur="6.9">that are behind him working with him to</text>
  <text start="233.14" dur="7.92">build this system up for the transition</text>
  <text start="236.98" dur="8.19">and what what better way to do this but</text>
  <text start="241.06" dur="7.74">with the central bank&amp;#39;s funny-money why</text>
  <text start="245.17" dur="9.319">don&amp;#39;t we just use their funds to build</text>
  <text start="248.8" dur="7.53">the u.s. the back to the way it was and</text>
  <text start="254.489" dur="3.941">this is what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="256.33" dur="5.43">because once the central bank goes down</text>
  <text start="258.43" dur="5.78">all this debt they&amp;#39;re gonna say null and</text>
  <text start="261.76" dur="5.39">void because they&amp;#39;re gonna go into their</text>
  <text start="264.21" dur="5.44">books they&amp;#39;re going to audit them</text>
  <text start="267.15" dur="5.53">they&amp;#39;re gonna find out that the central</text>
  <text start="269.65" dur="6.24">bank has not been honest to the American</text>
  <text start="272.68" dur="5.82">people and most of the debt and most of</text>
  <text start="275.89" dur="6.39">what they&amp;#39;ve done was completely against</text>
  <text start="278.5" dur="7.26">their charter and everything most likely</text>
  <text start="282.28" dur="5.34">by then will be null and void and we</text>
  <text start="285.76" dur="4.74">could see that it is definitely playing</text>
  <text start="287.62" dur="5.46">out this way now remember the Fed is</text>
  <text start="290.5" dur="5.25">looking at the data and I believe Powell</text>
  <text start="293.08" dur="5.31">is definitely working with Trump on this</text>
  <text start="295.75" dur="4.89">to bring the Fed to the very very edge</text>
  <text start="298.39" dur="4.83">and this is why they&amp;#39;re going at each</text>
  <text start="300.64" dur="5.1">other and this is why Trump is calling</text>
  <text start="303.22" dur="4.44">out the Fed just like Trump and sessions</text>
  <text start="305.74" dur="3.57">where they&amp;#39;re making everyone look at</text>
  <text start="307.66" dur="3.48">this situation where they&amp;#39;re very angry</text>
  <text start="309.31" dur="3.99">with each other while other things are</text>
  <text start="311.14" dur="3.99">happening in the background so we know</text>
  <text start="313.3" dur="4.049">the Fed they&amp;#39;re going to raise most</text>
  <text start="315.13" dur="4.95">likely the interest rates in September</text>
  <text start="317.349" dur="3.031">which is going to have a disaster as the</text>
  <text start="320.08" dur="2.4">fact</text>
  <text start="320.38" dur="3.66">on the economy especially the housing</text>
  <text start="322.48" dur="4.29">market and everything like this and</text>
  <text start="324.04" dur="5.31">Trump definitely wants the Fed to raise</text>
  <text start="326.77" dur="3.81">these rates to start bringing down the</text>
  <text start="329.35" dur="4.62">system in this way they can turn around</text>
  <text start="330.58" dur="5.52">and blame it on the Fed the other thing</text>
  <text start="333.97" dur="5.22">is they&amp;#39;re waiting to hit that inflation</text>
  <text start="336.1" dur="5.22">mark of 2% you know because that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="339.19" dur="3.51">magic number and that means yes we can</text>
  <text start="341.32" dur="2.67">raise rates because we want to make sure</text>
  <text start="342.7" dur="3.33">that we keep the economy from</text>
  <text start="343.99" dur="4.29">overheating but we know that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="346.03" dur="4.41">opposite we know that they&amp;#39;re raising</text>
  <text start="348.28" dur="4.56">the rates not to keep the economy from</text>
  <text start="350.44" dur="5.85">overheating but actually to overheat the</text>
  <text start="352.84" dur="6.51">economy and bring it down so right now</text>
  <text start="356.29" dur="5.1">the growth rate of Americans spending</text>
  <text start="359.35" dur="4.26">while that has slowed in the last three</text>
  <text start="361.39" dur="6.12">months but they&amp;#39;re telling us how great</text>
  <text start="363.61" dur="7.98">online sales were income growth has</text>
  <text start="367.51" dur="6.96">slowed so we have spending slowing</text>
  <text start="371.59" dur="6.99">income growth slowing at the same time</text>
  <text start="374.47" dur="6.06">and if we look at the income growth we</text>
  <text start="378.58" dur="4.65">see government employees they have been</text>
  <text start="380.53" dur="4.71">getting raises and their growth has been</text>
  <text start="383.23" dur="6.48">going up very interesting the private</text>
  <text start="385.24" dur="8.07">sector wages have been going down now</text>
  <text start="389.71" dur="6.41">this is very interesting because during</text>
  <text start="393.31" dur="5.7">Obama&amp;#39;s reign people were getting raises</text>
  <text start="396.12" dur="6.25">salaries were pushed up everyone was</text>
  <text start="399.01" dur="4.89">dependent on what the government well</text>
  <text start="402.37" dur="3.81">they can&amp;#39;t be dependent on the</text>
  <text start="403.9" dur="5.97">government anymore the government cannot</text>
  <text start="406.18" dur="7.11">support the number of people working for</text>
  <text start="409.87" dur="5.52">them the debt is too high everything</text>
  <text start="413.29" dur="5.1">cannot be sustained and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="415.39" dur="6.63">disaster and we&amp;#39;ll see and we&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="418.39" dur="5.13">about what Trump is doing to counter all</text>
  <text start="422.02" dur="3.81">of this and eventually what he&amp;#39;ll do is</text>
  <text start="423.52" dur="6.06">start removing some of these positions</text>
  <text start="425.83" dur="7.02">which he&amp;#39;s already started to do so we</text>
  <text start="429.58" dur="5.64">see the personal savings rate that has</text>
  <text start="432.85" dur="5.01">been declining also of course people are</text>
  <text start="435.22" dur="4.74">making the same amount of money so the</text>
  <text start="437.86" dur="6.59">savings rate is going down people are</text>
  <text start="439.96" dur="7.79">going further into debt growth wages</text>
  <text start="444.45" dur="7.21">spending all falling at the same time</text>
  <text start="447.75" dur="5.499">but the Fed wants inflation now think</text>
  <text start="451.66" dur="4.049">about this for a sec</text>
  <text start="453.249" dur="6.89">people are making less money they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="455.709" dur="8.4">going out spending their savings rate is</text>
  <text start="460.139" dur="6.52">declining and the Fed is looking for</text>
  <text start="464.109" dur="4.65">inflation and that will hurt the</text>
  <text start="466.659" dur="7.47">everyday person this way they can raise</text>
  <text start="468.759" dur="7.11">the interest rates and once again this</text>
  <text start="474.129" dur="4.32">is going to affect the housing market</text>
  <text start="475.869" dur="4.29">the student loan market the automobile</text>
  <text start="478.449" dur="4.38">market because remember over the many</text>
  <text start="480.159" dur="5.04">many years they&amp;#39;ve been suppressing the</text>
  <text start="482.829" dur="6">interest rates so people would purchase</text>
  <text start="485.199" dur="8.24">cars and go into debt go to college go</text>
  <text start="488.829" dur="7.44">into debt buy a house go into debt take</text>
  <text start="493.439" dur="5.56">loans out on their credit cards go into</text>
  <text start="496.269" dur="5.61">debt take home equity line of credit out</text>
  <text start="498.999" dur="6.84">on their mortgage go into debt further</text>
  <text start="501.879" dur="6.81">debt and we see at this time that</text>
  <text start="505.839" dur="4.771">they&amp;#39;re going to raise the rates now</text>
  <text start="508.689" dur="5.01">once they start doing this once again</text>
  <text start="510.61" dur="4.979">the housing market is gonna start to</text>
  <text start="513.699" dur="4.14">fall and to start to fall apart much</text>
  <text start="515.589" dur="4.98">much faster the automobile industry</text>
  <text start="517.839" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re gonna have a tougher time people</text>
  <text start="520.569" dur="4.651">are gonna have a tougher time getting</text>
  <text start="521.439" dur="6.721">student loans and it&amp;#39;s all going to</text>
  <text start="525.22" dur="6.659">start to fall apart now if we look at</text>
  <text start="528.16" dur="5.88">the federal employer Trump made an</text>
  <text start="531.879" dur="5.671">announcement that government worker</text>
  <text start="534.04" dur="5.219">wages are going to be frozen now these</text>
  <text start="537.55" dur="6.44">are non-military</text>
  <text start="539.259" dur="7.26">federal employees we have a lot of those</text>

  <text start="741.58" dur="5.25">can&amp;#39;t come out to the general public</text>
  <text start="743.47" dur="6.69">because the economy would implode right</text>
  <text start="746.83" dur="9.6">there and then and we wouldn&amp;#39;t be able</text>
  <text start="750.16" dur="11.489">to prepare for a new system so this is</text>
  <text start="756.43" dur="8.76">why Trump decided not to say anything at</text>
  <text start="761.649" dur="6.511">this time because he knew and not just</text>
  <text start="765.19" dur="6.24">him but others they knew they were going</text>
  <text start="768.16" dur="6.15">to have to prepare this economy for the</text>
  <text start="771.43" dur="6.33">next economic system why do you think he</text>
  <text start="774.31" dur="8.88">struck down TPP why did he renegotiate</text>
  <text start="777.76" dur="8.519">NAFTA why did he cut programs he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="783.19" dur="6.57">all this for a specific reason yes the</text>
  <text start="786.279" dur="4.771">debt is going up because why not use the</text>
  <text start="789.76" dur="3.96">free money right now</text>
  <text start="791.05" dur="7.05">to build the economy up to where we</text>
  <text start="793.72" dur="6.809">needed to be for the new system and just</text>
  <text start="798.1" dur="3.84">from Trump going out there and putting</text>
  <text start="800.529" dur="3.361">the pay raise to zero</text>
  <text start="801.94" dur="3.839">that should tell you something because</text>
  <text start="803.89" dur="3.96">if the economy was doing really really</text>
  <text start="805.779" dur="4.291">well he wouldn&amp;#39;t have to do this but he</text>
  <text start="807.85" dur="4.739">stopped the funding to Middle East</text>
  <text start="810.07" dur="5.93">he stopped funding in other areas and</text>
  <text start="812.589" dur="7.741">you&amp;#39;re gonna see individuals being cut</text>
  <text start="816" dur="8.44">people being laid off in government this</text>
  <text start="820.33" dur="8.73">all has to be done prior to us moving to</text>
  <text start="824.44" dur="7.41">a new system to make it easier for the</text>
  <text start="829.06" dur="4.41">masses because if he just mentioned the</text>
  <text start="831.85" dur="4.229">stock market was a bubble everything I</text>
  <text start="833.47" dur="3.989">thought was all true and everything is</text>
  <text start="836.079" dur="5.731">fake phony and false everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="837.459" dur="6.531">manipulated we&amp;#39;re doomed well we would</text>
  <text start="841.81" dur="4.89">all be doomed it would be a nightmare</text>
  <text start="843.99" dur="6.719">there&amp;#39;d be riots to be civil war to be</text>
  <text start="846.7" dur="7.869">you name it it would all happen remember</text>
  <text start="850.709" dur="5.891">those in power the central bank the</text>
  <text start="854.569" dur="6.091">they were planning on something</text>
  <text start="856.6" dur="7.63">completely different to explain away why</text>
  <text start="860.66" dur="5.969">the economy was failing why you couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="864.23" dur="5.43">get food why you couldn&amp;#39;t get supplies</text>
  <text start="866.629" dur="7.14">why you couldn&amp;#39;t get food why you</text>
  <text start="869.66" dur="6.899">couldn&amp;#39;t get medical supplies this was</text>
  <text start="873.769" dur="5.31">going to be because of a war and it</text>
  <text start="876.559" dur="4.47">would be a great excuse I mean go back</text>
  <text start="879.079" dur="3.69">to the 1970s when we&amp;#39;re coming off the</text>
  <text start="881.029" dur="4.16">gold standard and we&amp;#39;re moving on to the</text>
  <text start="882.769" dur="5.76">petro dollar what was their narrative oh</text>
  <text start="885.189" dur="6.07">we can&amp;#39;t find any more oil we have a big</text>
  <text start="888.529" dur="7.05">shortage and this is why you have to</text>
  <text start="891.259" dur="6.33">sacrifice and drive slower in the United</text>
  <text start="895.579" dur="3.661">States they lower the speed limit to 55</text>
  <text start="897.589" dur="4.47">because they told us how much fuel that</text>
  <text start="899.24" dur="5.25">would save us theirs they were saying</text>
  <text start="902.059" dur="4.981">that we had no fuel we couldn&amp;#39;t find any</text>
  <text start="904.49" dur="4.349">this is why there were lines no we were</text>
  <text start="907.04" dur="4.769">moving off the gold standard and moving</text>
  <text start="908.839" dur="5.61">on to the central bankers new system and</text>
  <text start="911.809" dur="4.71">their narrative was there was a shortage</text>
  <text start="914.449" dur="5.01">of oil there was no shortage there was</text>
  <text start="916.519" dur="5.43">plenty of oil there was plenty of what</text>
  <text start="919.459" dur="4.38">we needed but that was their excuse</text>
  <text start="921.949" dur="5.64">don&amp;#39;t you think it&amp;#39;s odd that we had a</text>
  <text start="923.839" dur="8.19">shortage and all of a sudden how many</text>
  <text start="927.589" dur="7.881">years later 47 years later we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="932.029" dur="6.691">okay I mean think about the population</text>
  <text start="935.47" dur="7.359">has increased the number of automobiles</text>
  <text start="938.72" dur="9.709">has increased we fly more planes now we</text>

  <text start="948.429" dur="6.34">everyday life and we&amp;#39;re doing it 10</text>
  <text start="952.309" dur="7.47">times than what we were doing in the</text>
  <text start="954.769" dur="6.75">1970s so when we think about this we</text>
  <text start="959.779" dur="4.53">need to use logic we need to understand</text>
  <text start="961.519" dur="5.16">what is going on here and we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="964.309" dur="4.95">prepared and ready for this major</text>
