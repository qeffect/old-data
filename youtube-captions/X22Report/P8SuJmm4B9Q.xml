  <text start="94.259" dur="6.421">part of the british empire but they said</text>
  <text start="98.189" dur="4.081">enough is enough and they started anew</text>
  <text start="100.68" dur="3.899">and that&amp;#39;s why they created the</text>
  <text start="102.27" dur="4.739">constitution bill of rights and said</text>

  <text start="497.74" dur="6.78">billion to pay down the 16 trillion and</text>
  <text start="501.28" dur="7.46">you know almost 17 trillion in debt so I</text>
  <text start="504.52" dur="8.97">I just stopped it and it&amp;#39;s 16 trillion</text>
  <text start="508.74" dur="7.44">838 838 billion so if they pay down the</text>
  <text start="513.49" dur="6.72">35 billion it would be sixteen trillion</text>
  <text start="516.18" dur="6.88">803 billion but then again the debt</text>
  <text start="520.21" dur="9.6">continually rises so let&amp;#39;s put this in</text>

  <text start="532.72" dur="4.23">hundred thousand dollars worth of debt</text>
  <text start="534.4" dur="5.749">and i decided to pay down the</text>
  <text start="536.95" dur="7.559">hundred-thousand-dollar dead of 3500</text>
  <text start="540.149" dur="6.821">is that really do anything no it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="544.509" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s a joke what they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="546.97" dur="7.77">it&amp;#39;s propaganda so they can put this on</text>
  <text start="550.029" dur="7.021">the front page of the newspapers on the</text>
  <text start="554.74" dur="4.32">websites so people go oh look we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="562" dur="8.61">sequester go to US debt the u.s. debt</text>
  <text start="566.44" dur="6.3">clock org look how the the debt</text>
  <text start="570.61" dur="6.209">continually rises even with the</text>
  <text start="572.74" dur="6.029">sequester it&amp;#39;s still going up yeah it</text>
  <text start="576.819" dur="3.541">might have slowed a little bit still</text>
  <text start="578.769" dur="4.74">going up even when they pay this down</text>
  <text start="580.36" dur="11.459">still going up we will hit 17 trillion</text>
  <text start="583.509" dur="10.88">no matter what they do now they they are</text>
  <text start="591.819" dur="6.541">pushing this internet sales tax and</text>
  <text start="594.389" dur="7.421">they&amp;#39;re trying to impose more taxes on</text>
  <text start="598.36" dur="5.88">the people to pay for the 17 trillion</text>
  <text start="601.81" dur="4.829">actually it&amp;#39;s more but we&amp;#39;ll just use 17</text>
  <text start="604.24" dur="4.8">trillion um if you take everything into</text>
  <text start="606.639" dur="7.411">account but we&amp;#39;ll just use 17 trillion</text>
  <text start="609.04" dur="7.979">of debt they are trying to tax us</text>
  <text start="614.05" dur="6.779">everywhere with Obamacare with the</text>
  <text start="617.019" dur="9.451">internet tax with income tax we have</text>
  <text start="620.829" dur="8.041">more taxes than then then you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="626.47" dur="7.53">it&amp;#39;s ridiculous the amount of taxes that</text>
  <text start="628.87" dur="6.959">we have but but in the Commerce Clause</text>
  <text start="634" dur="5.189">in the United States Constitution</text>
  <text start="635.829" dur="6.541">affirms that States cannot tax across</text>
  <text start="639.189" dur="5.57">their borders you need a physical</text>
  <text start="642.37" dur="5.04">presence within estates boundaries is</text>
  <text start="644.759" dur="6.52">required for a state to be able to tax a</text>
  <text start="647.41" dur="6.9">business that the Constitution is clear</text>
  <text start="651.279" dur="5.341">a person or business must be physically</text>
  <text start="654.31" dur="4.74">present within estates borders in order</text>
  <text start="656.62" dur="5.04">to be taxed by suggesting the</text>
  <text start="659.05" dur="4.469">Constitution is outdated internet tax</text>
  <text start="661.66" dur="5.13">pushers align themselves with the</text>
  <text start="663.519" dur="6.06">rhetoric of far left judicial activists</text>
  <text start="666.79" dur="5.149">so basically here we go again with them</text>
  <text start="669.579" dur="5.571">doing whatever they want and not</text>
  <text start="671.939" dur="6.791">following the Constitution</text>
  <text start="675.15" dur="7.84">just because it&amp;#39;s electronic doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="678.73" dur="7.53">mean the Constitution is outdated we</text>
  <text start="682.99" dur="5.73">still send emails we still right you</text>
  <text start="686.26" dur="4.59">know whatever color it is we use still</text>
  <text start="688.72" dur="4.17">use the English language or whatever</text>
  <text start="690.85" dur="6.57">language you&amp;#39;re using to send an email</text>
  <text start="692.89" dur="6.99">the only difference is the delivery just</text>
  <text start="697.42" dur="5.73">like when we did mail-order forget the</text>
  <text start="699.88" dur="5.34">internet you get a catalogue to your</text>
  <text start="703.15" dur="4.35">house and you place an order and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="705.22" dur="4.68">across state boundaries you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="707.5" dur="4.92">physically in that state and that has</text>
  <text start="709.9" dur="4.62">nothing to do with the internet that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="712.42" dur="4.23">been going on you know the order the</text>
  <text start="714.52" dur="5.4">mail order been going on for hundreds</text>
  <text start="716.65" dur="6.33">and hundreds of years the internet is</text>
  <text start="719.92" dur="6.66">just a different way of reading the</text>
  <text start="722.98" dur="5.58">catalog and ordering there is no</text>
  <text start="726.58" dur="3.63">difference and they&amp;#39;re trying to make it</text>
  <text start="728.56" dur="3.63">because everyone here is internet and I</text>
  <text start="730.21" dur="3.96">hear technology they go oh it&amp;#39;s got to</text>
  <text start="732.19" dur="4.32">be different oh it&amp;#39;s got to be you know</text>
  <text start="734.17" dur="4.68">has to be more advanced it really isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="736.51" dur="4.8">think about it you go on the internet</text>
  <text start="738.85" dur="4.68">and you&amp;#39;re shopping at amazon let&amp;#39;s say</text>
