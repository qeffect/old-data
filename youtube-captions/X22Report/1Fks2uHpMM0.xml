  <text start="132.48" dur="3.93">can see right now that they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="134.069" dur="5.221">this agenda now if you look at the</text>
  <text start="136.41" dur="4.98">economy today you can see that we have</text>
  <text start="139.29" dur="4.71">been built up on this gigantic illusion</text>
  <text start="141.39" dur="5.069">just like in 2008 everyone thought that</text>
  <text start="144" dur="5.49">everything was great and if you go back</text>
  <text start="146.459" dur="5.971">to 2007 leading into 2008 and you listen</text>
  <text start="149.49" dur="5.07">to all the financial pundits anyone that</text>
  <text start="152.43" dur="3.75">said any different that the economy was</text>
  <text start="154.56" dur="3.63">going to collapse or we&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="156.18" dur="3.72">credit problems or the housing market</text>
  <text start="158.19" dur="3.03">was going to collapse they just sat</text>
  <text start="159.9" dur="4.05">there and laughed and said that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="161.22" dur="4.56">completely impossible look how great the</text>
  <text start="163.95" dur="4.5">economy is doing today</text>
  <text start="165.78" dur="5.61">and then what happened everything fell</text>
  <text start="168.45" dur="5.16">apart they were completely wrong just</text>
  <text start="171.39" dur="4.5">because you&amp;#39;re looking at this illusion</text>
  <text start="173.61" dur="3.45">and you&amp;#39;re looking at the illusion that</text>
  <text start="175.89" dur="3.209">the economy&amp;#39;s doing well in the</text>
  <text start="177.06" dur="4.62">manipulating while the numbers doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="179.099" dur="4.851">mean it&amp;#39;s going to last it doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="181.68" dur="4.68">that this is really what the economy is</text>
  <text start="183.95" dur="5.13">made out of</text>
  <text start="186.36" dur="4.68">because if you look back in 2008</text>
  <text start="189.08" dur="4.12">everyone who was investing in those</text>
  <text start="191.04" dur="3.66">subprime securities they were they</text>
  <text start="193.2" dur="4.38">thought they were secure triple-a baby</text>
  <text start="194.7" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re great and then they come</text>
  <text start="197.58" dur="4.58">to find out it was all a lie the same</text>
  <text start="200.16" dur="4.32">thing is happening right now the</text>
  <text start="202.16" dur="4.51">illusionary numbers in the housing</text>
  <text start="204.48" dur="5.52">market the stock exchange all of this</text>
  <text start="206.67" dur="5.37">stuff has been made up and it just</text>
  <text start="210" dur="5.1">didn&amp;#39;t start in 2016 and went all the</text>
  <text start="212.04" dur="6.45">way back to 2008 and even prior to that</text>
  <text start="215.1" dur="7.38">this is the way the central bankers work</text>
  <text start="218.49" dur="8.34">and if you listen to the NFIB small</text>
  <text start="222.48" dur="7.64">business survey you would think that the</text>
  <text start="226.83" dur="6.36">economy is doing better than ever</text>
  <text start="230.12" dur="5.4">unemployment&amp;#39;s very low stock market is</text>
  <text start="233.19" dur="5.519">way up corporate profits are up</text>
  <text start="235.52" dur="8.71">everything looks great the question is</text>
  <text start="238.709" dur="9.361">why are people worrying about the high</text>
  <text start="244.23" dur="7.05">cost of living why are they worrying</text>

  <text start="265.38" dur="6.75">time fine finding those high-paying jobs</text>
  <text start="267.93" dur="7.59">and when they&amp;#39;ve taken this survey they</text>
  <text start="272.13" dur="5.039">found that 71% of the people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="275.52" dur="6">worried about the high cost of living</text>
  <text start="277.169" dur="9.331">because wages are stagnant and inflation</text>
  <text start="281.52" dur="7.28">is hitting I mean if we look at the</text>
  <text start="286.5" dur="5.43">younger respondents those in their 20s</text>
  <text start="288.8" dur="6.119">they&amp;#39;re reporting difficulty in finding</text>

  <text start="303.69" dur="4.59">concerns of this is the stock market</text>
  <text start="305.4" dur="4.68">crashing that&amp;#39;s the highest thing on</text>
  <text start="308.28" dur="5.16">their list right now the next one down</text>
  <text start="310.08" dur="6.06">is inflation because they see what is</text>

  <text start="331.139" dur="5.61">illusion now we&amp;#39;re starting to see a</text>
  <text start="334.349" dur="5.82">capital flight to Germany the</text>
  <text start="336.749" dur="7.41">Netherlands Finland it is all in full</text>
  <text start="340.169" dur="6.691">swing right now the debt cannot be paid</text>
  <text start="344.159" dur="5.13">back the central banks of Germany&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="346.86" dur="6.739">Europe partners Italy Spain France oh</text>
  <text start="349.289" dur="7.53">the Bundesbank almost a trillion euros</text>
  <text start="353.599" dur="6.97">this is a new high more than ever before</text>
  <text start="356.819" dur="5.761">and guess what this is going to</text>
  <text start="360.569" dur="5.31">continually rise it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="362.58" dur="3.829">shrink there is no security for this</text>
  <text start="365.879" dur="3.421">money</text>
  <text start="366.409" dur="4.66">Italy is four hundred and sixty four</text>
  <text start="369.3" dur="3.419">point seven billion euros in the whole</text>
  <text start="371.069" dur="4.77">Spain is three hundred and seventy six</text>

  <text start="378.179" dur="6.54">over 1.15 seven trillion euros in may</text>
  <text start="382.399" dur="7.091">italian liabilities increase by almost</text>
  <text start="384.719" dur="6.57">40 billion euros so capital flight to</text>
  <text start="389.49" dur="6.599">Germany is in full swing</text>
  <text start="391.289" dur="7.44">originally target 2 this was designed to</text>
  <text start="396.089" dur="5.401">facilitate cross-border transactions</text>
  <text start="398.729" dur="5.04">within the eurozone the system achieved</text>
  <text start="401.49" dur="4.109">this goal from the point of view of the</text>
  <text start="403.769" dur="3.21">critics this means that the Deutsche</text>
  <text start="405.599" dur="4.61">Bundesbank</text>
  <text start="406.979" dur="5.25">provides a long-term unsecured and non</text>
  <text start="410.209" dur="3.88">interest-bearing loans to the central</text>
  <text start="412.229" dur="3.99">banks of other eurozone countries</text>
  <text start="414.089" dur="4.25">especially the Central Bank of southern</text>
  <text start="416.219" dur="7.29">countries like Italy Spain and Portugal</text>
  <text start="418.339" dur="9.94">target 2 is fundamentally a problem in</text>
  <text start="423.509" dur="7.92">the eurozone the ECB guarantees these</text>
  <text start="428.279" dur="5.37">loans as long as they guaranteed then</text>
  <text start="431.429" dur="4.89">why not make more loans and this is what</text>
  <text start="433.649" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;ve been doing Germany&amp;#39;s gonna have</text>
  <text start="436.319" dur="5.24">to pay no matter what one way or another</text>
  <text start="437.969" dur="6.6">and here are some of the possibilities</text>
  <text start="441.559" dur="6.28">Germany and the creditor nations forgive</text>
  <text start="444.569" dur="6.03">enough debt for Europe to grow I doubt</text>
  <text start="447.839" dur="5.981">it the other alternative may be break up</text>
  <text start="450.599" dur="5.471">the euro zone I think the best move</text>
  <text start="453.82" dur="5.07">would be for Germany to leave the</text>
  <text start="456.07" dur="6.51">eurozone Germany is in the best shape to</text>
  <text start="458.89" dur="7.62">suffer the consequences and we see right</text>
  <text start="462.58" dur="7.44">now that the eurozone most likely will</text>
  <text start="466.51" dur="6.42">end up disintegrating because what is</text>
  <text start="470.02" dur="5.91">happening here is that these countries</text>
  <text start="472.93" dur="6.26">are in trouble the banks are in trouble</text>
  <text start="475.93" dur="6.75">the global economy is in trouble the</text>
  <text start="479.19" dur="4.63">central banking global economy is being</text>
  <text start="482.68" dur="3.66">ripped apart right now</text>
  <text start="483.82" dur="4.59">and we&amp;#39;ve been talking about the</text>
  <text start="486.34" dur="4.23">narrative on whoever controls the</text>
  <text start="488.41" dur="4.98">narrative is going to be the winner and</text>
  <text start="490.57" dur="5.46">will be able to control the next economy</text>
  <text start="493.39" dur="6.69">we move into and we see that the Fed</text>
  <text start="496.03" dur="6.87">well the Fed has raised the rates once</text>
  <text start="500.08" dur="4.94">again and they&amp;#39;re expecting to do this</text>
  <text start="502.9" dur="6.24">two more times they&amp;#39;re saying and</text>
  <text start="505.02" dur="6.82">basically there was a vote and Fed</text>
  <text start="509.14" dur="6.18">raises rates with an eight to zero vote</text>
  <text start="511.84" dur="8.31">everyone said yeah let&amp;#39;s do it so the</text>
  <text start="515.32" dur="9.36">Fed is pushing their agenda they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="520.15" dur="9.12">copying exactly what they did prior to</text>
  <text start="524.68" dur="6.36">2008 going from 2006 to 2007 they raised</text>
  <text start="529.27" dur="4.71">the interest rates up to a certain point</text>
  <text start="531.04" dur="4.68">and then everything just started to</text>
  <text start="533.98" dur="3.81">collapse I mean it was collapsing when</text>
  <text start="535.72" dur="3.84">they reached the height of the interest</text>
  <text start="537.79" dur="3.75">rates and then once they said okay that</text>
  <text start="539.56" dur="4.02">was enough they started lowering them</text>
  <text start="541.54" dur="5.16">not by a little they dropped him very</text>
  <text start="543.58" dur="5.46">very quickly now of course they were not</text>
  <text start="546.7" dur="5.22">to blame for this they blamed everything</text>
  <text start="549.04" dur="6.3">else the same thing is going to happen</text>
  <text start="551.92" dur="5.04">once again they are going to raise the</text>
  <text start="555.34" dur="3.48">interest rates and we&amp;#39;re already seeing</text>
  <text start="556.96" dur="4.2">the economy start to fall apart here</text>
  <text start="558.82" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s deteriorating in the housing market</text>
  <text start="561.16" dur="6.75">the automobile loan market the student</text>
  <text start="564.04" dur="6.75">loan market GDP numbers you name it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="567.91" dur="5.37">all going to fall apart now the Fed also</text>
  <text start="570.79" dur="4.08">expects the Fed Funds rate to rise from</text>
  <text start="573.28" dur="6.03">two point one to two point four percent</text>
  <text start="574.87" dur="8.55">at the end of 2018 and from two point</text>
  <text start="579.31" dur="6.3">nine to three point one by 2019 and you</text>
  <text start="583.42" dur="4.06">know what&amp;#39;s going to happen once this</text>
  <text start="585.61" dur="6.49">hits a certain level the whole</text>
  <text start="587.48" dur="8.33">start falls apart now since the Fed last</text>
  <text start="592.1" dur="8.25">hike rates in March financial conditions</text>
  <text start="595.81" dur="8.44">well they started to fall apart and we</text>
  <text start="600.35" dur="7.34">can see this and the US economic hard</text>
  <text start="604.25" dur="5.839">data well everything was declining</text>
  <text start="607.69" dur="5.649">everything started to fall apart and</text>
  <text start="610.089" dur="5.44">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now the</text>
  <text start="613.339" dur="6.091">same thing happened back in 2006 going</text>
  <text start="615.529" dur="7.291">into 2007 all the data everything that</text>
  <text start="619.43" dur="6.33">we saw started to fall apart completely</text>
  <text start="622.82" dur="5.55">and we&amp;#39;re going to see the same thing so</text>
  <text start="625.76" dur="6.42">they&amp;#39;ve just pushed their agenda right</text>
  <text start="628.37" dur="7.35">now and they&amp;#39;re pushing it and trying to</text>
  <text start="632.18" dur="7.019">force this system to crash so they can</text>
  <text start="635.72" dur="5.85">say and they&amp;#39;re already telling us who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="639.199" dur="5.791">going to blame for all of this and this</text>
  <text start="641.57" dur="5.519">is the policies of Trump the tax cuts</text>
  <text start="644.99" dur="3.39">this is why Ben Bernanke says the</text>
  <text start="647.089" dur="4.56">economies are going to be crashing in</text>
  <text start="648.38" dur="6.209">2020 because the tax cuts Christine</text>
  <text start="651.649" dur="6.12">Lagarde is out there from the IMF saying</text>
  <text start="654.589" dur="6.211">because of the tariffs because Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="657.769" dur="5.341">policies the clouds are rolling in and</text>
  <text start="660.8" dur="3.68">it&amp;#39;s getting darker and darker soon</text>
  <text start="663.11" dur="4.83">you&amp;#39;re gonna hear the corporate media</text>
  <text start="664.48" dur="5.229">this was the signal right now they</text>
  <text start="667.94" dur="3.78">already started the deterioration of the</text>
  <text start="669.709" dur="4.141">economy with the last rate hike this one</text>
  <text start="671.72" dur="4.53">is going to drive it even further south</text>
  <text start="673.85" dur="4.349">so now the corporate media is gonna jump</text>
  <text start="676.25" dur="4.23">on the bandwagon because they have</text>
  <text start="678.199" dur="4.861">nothing left and they&amp;#39;re gonna start to</text>
  <text start="680.48" dur="4.74">blame everything that Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="683.06" dur="5.219">right now this was the plan from the</text>
  <text start="685.22" dur="6.39">beginning this economy was never going</text>
  <text start="688.279" dur="5.461">to make it and at the same time Trump is</text>
  <text start="691.61" dur="4.5">going to blame this on the central banks</text>
  <text start="693.74" dur="4.469">he&amp;#39;s going to blame it on government</text>
  <text start="696.11" dur="4.86">officials from the past blaming on the</text>
  <text start="698.209" dur="6.841">central banks and most likely move to</text>
  <text start="700.97" dur="6.15">audit the central banks and you can see</text>
