  <text start="151.45" dur="8.31">started with the economic collapse news</text>
  <text start="154.47" dur="8.2">Nigel Farage is basically talking about</text>
  <text start="159.76" dur="6.6">the European nations and what is going</text>
  <text start="162.67" dur="6.63">on and basically he goes on to say that</text>
  <text start="166.36" dur="6.15">the entire Euro system is probably going</text>
  <text start="169.3" dur="7.23">to go down as one of the worst ideas in</text>
  <text start="172.51" dur="5.61">the history of economics and he goes on</text>
  <text start="176.53" dur="4.47">to say that the central bank Fiat system</text>
  <text start="178.12" dur="5.85">that pervades global finance is already</text>
  <text start="181" dur="6.6">ludicrous enough we entrust the reins of</text>
  <text start="183.97" dur="6.81">an entire economy the prices of goods</text>
  <text start="187.6" dur="5.79">and services the printing press total</text>
  <text start="190.78" dur="7.05">control financial markets to a tiny</text>
  <text start="193.39" dur="7.47">elite and we&amp;#39;ve seen this before it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="197.83" dur="6.51">bunch of central bankers they&amp;#39;re made of</text>
  <text start="200.86" dur="6.06">people around the world and basically</text>
  <text start="204.34" dur="6.03">they are controlling all the western</text>
  <text start="206.92" dur="6.12">central banks and these people start</text>
  <text start="210.37" dur="5.7">wars and if you haven&amp;#39;t read it yet I do</text>
  <text start="213.04" dur="4.46">have an article on my site and if you</text>
  <text start="216.07" dur="4.86">scroll all the way down on the homepage</text>
  <text start="217.5" dur="5.86">to articles there is an article on the</text>
  <text start="220.93" dur="5.85">right hand side you just have to pick on</text>
  <text start="223.36" dur="5.4">the category that all but all wars or</text>
  <text start="226.78" dur="5.78">banker wars this was written by michael</text>
  <text start="228.76" dur="6.15">rivera from what&amp;#39;s happening calm and</text>
  <text start="232.56" dur="4.87">you can read that and i have it on the</text>
  <text start="234.91" dur="4.049">site and basically what happens with the</text>
  <text start="237.43" dur="5.52">central bankers for those countries that</text>
  <text start="238.959" dur="6.301">are not using the united states dollar</text>
  <text start="242.95" dur="5.13">as the reserve currency and they do not</text>
  <text start="245.26" dur="5.93">have a central bank in that country they</text>
  <text start="248.08" dur="5.25">pretty much invade it just like Syria</text>
  <text start="251.19" dur="4.54">you know they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re pretending</text>
  <text start="253.33" dur="5.939">there is a revolution going on and are</text>
  <text start="255.73" dur="5.25">going into these areas and invading to</text>
  <text start="259.269" dur="3.571">take over the country to force them back</text>
  <text start="260.98" dur="4.74">onto the reserve currency set up central</text>
  <text start="262.84" dur="5.9">bank and by going into Syria they have a</text>
  <text start="265.72" dur="6.56">straight path to Iran because Iran</text>
  <text start="268.74" dur="5.34">back up Syria and they also the real</text>
  <text start="272.28" dur="4.47">prize is really Iran they really want to</text>
  <text start="274.08" dur="5.88">get into to put them back on the reserve</text>
  <text start="276.75" dur="5.46">currency and set up a central bank</text>
  <text start="279.96" dur="6.57">because right now Iran is trading their</text>
  <text start="282.21" dur="8.34">oil to China to Russia to North Korea</text>
  <text start="286.53" dur="5.97">and to other places not using the US</text>
  <text start="290.55" dur="4.32">dollar as a reserve currency they were</text>
  <text start="292.5" dur="5.22">trading their oil in gold but now the</text>
  <text start="294.87" dur="5.9">United States has put sanctions on Iran</text>
  <text start="297.72" dur="5.189">and stopping them from using gold and</text>
  <text start="300.77" dur="6.76">basically this has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="302.909" dur="7.32">anything except that they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="307.53" dur="7.71">putting the squeeze on them to end and</text>
  <text start="310.229" dur="7.981">forcing people not to purchase the oil</text>
  <text start="315.24" dur="5.519">and hopefully they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="318.21" dur="4.049">provoke I ran into doing something with</text>
  <text start="320.759" dur="3.69">all these sanctions and this is what</text>
  <text start="322.259" dur="4.321">these central bankers and governments do</text>
  <text start="324.449" dur="4.53">they put the squeeze they put sanctions</text>
  <text start="326.58" dur="4.26">and they they squeeze tighter and</text>
  <text start="328.979" dur="3.75">tighter and tighter until the country</text>
  <text start="330.84" dur="3.87">can&amp;#39;t take it anymore and they try to</text>
  <text start="332.729" dur="5.011">provoke them into starting some type of</text>
  <text start="334.71" dur="6.179">war because that is the end game because</text>
  <text start="337.74" dur="6.239">the economic collapse is coming and they</text>
  <text start="340.889" dur="5.611">know this this is a fact and they know</text>
  <text start="343.979" dur="5.671">the only way to cover this up so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="346.5" dur="6.75">not to blame is to blame it on another</text>
  <text start="349.65" dur="5.639">country and blame it on the war blame it</text>
  <text start="353.25" dur="4.83">on the country and we have to go to war</text>
  <text start="355.289" dur="8.06">and blah blah blah blah that&amp;#39;s what they</text>
  <text start="358.08" dur="8.399">always say now basically Portugal and</text>
  <text start="363.349" dur="4.361">Greece they are in big trouble and</text>
  <text start="366.479" dur="4.021">they&amp;#39;re wondering if Portugal is going</text>
  <text start="367.71" dur="5.009">to be the next Greece coalition leaders</text>
  <text start="370.5" dur="4.319">will reconvene in Portugal and emergency</text>
  <text start="372.719" dur="4.161">meeting to address Lisbon&amp;#39;s plan to</text>
  <text start="374.819" dur="5.431">complete a hundred two billion dollar</text>
  <text start="376.88" dur="6.4">bailout by next year protecting the euro</text>
  <text start="380.25" dur="5.099">and restoring bond yields the situation</text>
  <text start="383.28" dur="5.789">in most of Portugal&amp;#39;s economy is far</text>
  <text start="385.349" dur="5.94">from stable and basically they are very</text>
  <text start="389.069" dur="4.38">worried that Portugal is going to turn</text>
  <text start="391.289" dur="5.49">into an ex Greece and I said this over</text>
  <text start="393.449" dur="6.571">and over piling more debt on top of that</text>
  <text start="396.779" dur="5.311">on top of debt doesn&amp;#39;t work and we see</text>
  <text start="400.02" dur="4.8">this all over we see this</text>
  <text start="402.09" dur="5.37">cypress here&amp;#39;s an example let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="404.82" dur="5.22">back to cypress for an instance they</text>
  <text start="407.46" dur="5.25">realize bailouts don&amp;#39;t work so what did</text>
  <text start="410.04" dur="8.3">they try they try to Balon now it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="412.71" dur="7.679">a hundred days since these balance and</text>
  <text start="418.34" dur="4.03">capital countries now you have to</text>
  <text start="420.389" dur="4.711">remember back when they first started</text>
  <text start="422.37" dur="4.23">they told you and I said there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="425.1" dur="3.629">they&amp;#39;re releasing these capital controls</text>
  <text start="426.6" dur="3.87">and you can go back to my episodes they</text>
  <text start="428.729" dur="5.431">told us capital controls will be there</text>
  <text start="430.47" dur="7.59">for two weeks it&amp;#39;s been a hundred days</text>
  <text start="434.16" dur="6.84">and they&amp;#39;re only can withdraw 300 euro</text>
  <text start="438.06" dur="6.45">and they are banned from opening new</text>
  <text start="441" dur="6.32">accounts in the banks but the powers</text>
  <text start="444.51" dur="6.48">that be this is what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="447.32" dur="5.8">they&amp;#39;re wondering why you know you know</text>
  <text start="450.99" dur="5.549">we had to let banks do what they have to</text>
  <text start="453.12" dur="6.99">do and this is what they&amp;#39;re saying about</text>
  <text start="456.539" dur="5.85">this and basically they&amp;#39;re saying you</text>
  <text start="460.11" dur="3.839">know analysts warn and economic rebound</text>
  <text start="462.389" dur="4.081">won&amp;#39;t happen until the country as a</text>
  <text start="463.949" dur="5.371">healthy banking sector sector doing what</text>
  <text start="466.47" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s supposed to be doing loaning people</text>
  <text start="469.32" dur="6.03">money to start businesses and to buy</text>
  <text start="471.87" dur="5.37">homes and invest well let&amp;#39;s use common</text>
  <text start="475.35" dur="4.2">sense here let&amp;#39;s say we have capital</text>
  <text start="477.24" dur="5.58">controls can open account can&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="479.55" dur="5.369">money out they took the people&amp;#39;s money</text>
  <text start="482.82" dur="5.31">they you know they took percentages of</text>
  <text start="484.919" dur="7.651">of their money they converted their</text>
  <text start="488.13" dur="6">money into crappy bank stock that is not</text>
  <text start="492.57" dur="4.11">worth the paper that it&amp;#39;s written on and</text>
  <text start="494.13" dur="5.55">the rest of the money is frozen but they</text>
  <text start="496.68" dur="6.51">want the banks and they want the people</text>
  <text start="499.68" dur="5.52">to go back to normal by taking out loans</text>
  <text start="503.19" dur="4.5">starting businesses most of the people</text>
  <text start="505.2" dur="4.77">have lost their businesses most of the</text>
  <text start="507.69" dur="3.81">people since they can&amp;#39;t get to their</text>
  <text start="509.97" dur="6.6">money and they can&amp;#39;t do what they want</text>
  <text start="511.5" dur="9.719">to do are not making it so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="516.57" dur="7.98">saying is a complete opposite of what</text>
  <text start="521.219" dur="7.021">they want but they know this this is all</text>
  <text start="524.55" dur="6.24">bs they know all they wanted to do was</text>
  <text start="528.24" dur="6.48">steal the people of their money they</text>
  <text start="530.79" dur="4.979">didn&amp;#39;t to bail out the elite to bail out</text>
  <text start="534.72" dur="5.179">the year</text>
  <text start="535.769" dur="7.41">this is all they did it&amp;#39;s almost like a</text>
  <text start="539.899" dur="5.13">loan shark coming saying you owe me this</text>
  <text start="543.179" dur="4.231">money I&amp;#39;m going to break your legs</text>
  <text start="545.029" dur="4.9">unless you give me this money and the</text>
  <text start="547.41" dur="4.919">person says well I have to keep working</text>
  <text start="549.929" dur="4.741">to pay off this money so they break his</text>
  <text start="552.329" dur="4.141">legs and they wonder why they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="554.67" dur="3.69">not getting their money because the guy</text>
  <text start="556.47" dur="4.619">can&amp;#39;t go to work because his legs are</text>
  <text start="558.36" dur="5.639">broken and it feels like this is the</text>
  <text start="561.089" dur="7.41">same exact thing that is happening here</text>
  <text start="563.999" dur="6.99">and again with any foreign investor want</text>
  <text start="568.499" dur="4.44">to put any money into Cyprus I mean</text>
  <text start="570.989" dur="3.33">basically this goes on to say foreign</text>
  <text start="572.939" dur="3.36">investors are holding back from putting</text>
  <text start="574.319" dur="3.57">their money at the Cyprus while Serbia</text>
  <text start="576.299" dur="5.04">to have steeply curtail their spending</text>
  <text start="577.889" dur="5.91">amid the uncertainty over the banks this</text>
  <text start="581.339" dur="6.331">has piled even more pressure on already</text>
  <text start="583.799" dur="5.01">hard hit retailers and basically do you</text>
  <text start="587.67" dur="3.479">think people are just running around</text>
  <text start="588.809" dur="4.14">spending money and buying things and</text>
  <text start="591.149" dur="5.331">foreign people are coming in wanting to</text>
  <text start="592.949" dur="7.37">invest no they&amp;#39;re not doing any of this</text>
  <text start="596.48" dur="6.01">so for them to expect something is</text>
  <text start="600.319" dur="5.171">ridiculous and then you go down further</text>
  <text start="602.49" dur="6.18">and you see that unemployment rate is at</text>
  <text start="605.49" dur="7.349">sixteen point three percent and expected</text>
  <text start="608.67" dur="8.719">to head higher so bail out bail ins all</text>
  <text start="612.839" dur="9.511">of this does not work and this bail in</text>
  <text start="617.389" dur="7.75">was a test of the FDIC Bank of England</text>
  <text start="622.35" dur="5.549">document that was created in 2012 of</text>
  <text start="625.139" dur="4.651">December and if you go to my tab</text>
  <text start="627.899" dur="5.49">resources documents I put that one up</text>
  <text start="629.79" dur="6.269">there and this they lay out that all</text>
  <text start="633.389" dur="4.32">people in banks are now creditors and if</text>
  <text start="636.059" dur="4.411">you go to the terms of services of your</text>
  <text start="637.709" dur="5.151">bank you&amp;#39;ll see a new section that was</text>
  <text start="640.47" dur="7.559">added that everyone is a creditor now</text>
  <text start="642.86" dur="7.87">and you cannot hold the bank liable for</text>
  <text start="648.029" dur="6.511">money that is missing from cyberattacks</text>
  <text start="650.73" dur="5.909">riots war and so on and you can&amp;#39;t hold</text>
  <text start="654.54" dur="5.579">you know any of the representative bank</text>
  <text start="656.639" dur="5.43">CEO bank officers and they completely</text>
  <text start="660.119" dur="5.52">added that into their terms of service</text>
  <text start="662.069" dur="6.6">and we can see that all of this that</text>
  <text start="665.639" dur="4.001">they&amp;#39;re doing is not working so here are</text>
  <text start="668.669" dur="2.861">19</text>
  <text start="669.64" dur="3.81">reasons to be deeply concerned about the</text>
  <text start="671.53" dur="6.84">global economy as we enter the second</text>
  <text start="673.45" dur="6.48">half of 2013 number one the velocity of</text>
  <text start="678.37" dur="4.26">money in the United States has plunged</text>
  <text start="679.93" dur="4.65">into an all-time low it is extremely</text>
  <text start="682.63" dur="4.14">difficult to have an economic recovery</text>
  <text start="684.58" dur="4.29">if things are not lending money and</text>
  <text start="686.77" dur="4.23">people are not spending it and we see</text>
  <text start="688.87" dur="4.02">that here in the united states where the</text>
  <text start="691" dur="5.16">fed is buying the mortgage-backed</text>
  <text start="692.89" dur="6.42">securities and the Treasury bonds then</text>
  <text start="696.16" dur="4.26">buying the old foreclosed properties</text>
  <text start="699.31" dur="3.18">that the banks will have in their books</text>
  <text start="700.42" dur="4.41">at 40 to 45 billion dollars a month and</text>

  <text start="1563.2" dur="4.5">the United States saying we need to get</text>
