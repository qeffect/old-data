  <text start="111.899" dur="4.801">debt notes and for a very long time the</text>
  <text start="115.38" dur="3.39">central bank has been out there and</text>
  <text start="116.7" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;ve been demonizing cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="118.77" dur="5.07">some people like it some people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="120.75" dur="4.649">and they&amp;#39;ve done this with gold also</text>
  <text start="123.84" dur="3.9">they told us it was a barbarous relic</text>
  <text start="125.399" dur="4.411">you don&amp;#39;t really use it as money anymore</text>
  <text start="127.74" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s not really money you only use it</text>
  <text start="129.81" dur="6.39">for jewelry and the things that come up</text>
  <text start="132.78" dur="5.7">against their debt note that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="136.2" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re really afraid of and it looks</text>
  <text start="138.48" dur="8.24">like the Federal Reserve well they kind</text>
  <text start="142.14" dur="8.659">of let it slip of why they do not like</text>
  <text start="146.72" dur="8.32">cryptocurrency and why they are so</text>
  <text start="150.799" dur="6.671">afraid of it now think about this for a</text>
  <text start="155.04" dur="6.06">second cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="157.47" dur="4.849">it is completely decentralized it is a</text>
  <text start="161.1" dur="3.979">truth</text>
  <text start="162.319" dur="4.17">machine now of course in the past you</text>
  <text start="165.079" dur="3.901">heard central bank saying oh we can</text>
  <text start="166.489" dur="5.191">create our own cryptocurrency we can</text>
  <text start="168.98" dur="6.659">take control we can centralize it and</text>
  <text start="171.68" dur="8.399">they kept pushing this out there well</text>
  <text start="175.639" dur="9.891">guess what they just informed everyone</text>
  <text start="180.079" dur="9.06">of why cryptocurrency would demolish</text>
  <text start="185.53" dur="6.67">their paper debt system just like gold</text>
  <text start="189.139" dur="7.621">if every single country decided to use</text>
  <text start="192.2" dur="7.649">gold it would destroy their entire paper</text>
  <text start="196.76" dur="6.629">debt system in a snap of a finger</text>
  <text start="199.849" dur="7.47">now with cryptocurrency what they said</text>
  <text start="203.389" dur="7.261">was the following that if they decided</text>
  <text start="207.319" dur="7.111">to go and create their own Fed coin or</text>
  <text start="210.65" dur="6.479">any type of coin there&amp;#39;d be a problem</text>
  <text start="214.43" dur="5.97">because the cryptocurrencies they are</text>
  <text start="217.129" dur="5.97">decentralized and the central banks they</text>
  <text start="220.4" dur="5.519">like centralization so it would be</text>
  <text start="223.099" dur="7.26">necessary to centralize the</text>
  <text start="225.919" dur="8.28">cryptocurrency but that wouldn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="230.359" dur="5.701">for them this is what they said once we</text>
  <text start="234.199" dur="5.551">remove the decentralized nature of</text>
  <text start="236.06" dur="5.549">cryptocurrency not much is left of it</text>
  <text start="239.75" dur="5.79">virtual money that is centralized and</text>
  <text start="241.609" dur="6.63">issued by a central bank is electronic</text>
  <text start="245.54" dur="4.949">central bank money it is worthwhile to</text>
  <text start="248.239" dur="4.291">mention that electronic central bank</text>
  <text start="250.489" dur="4.441">money could have been offered a long</text>
  <text start="252.53" dur="4.35">time ago the technology for issuing</text>
  <text start="254.93" dur="5.07">virtual money in a centralized way</text>
  <text start="256.88" dur="6.39">exists long before the invention of the</text>
  <text start="260" dur="6.09">blockchain now right there and then they</text>
  <text start="263.27" dur="5.16">just told you why they can&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="266.09" dur="6.06">cryptocurrency and why they&amp;#39;re so afraid</text>
  <text start="268.43" dur="7.229">of it because it&amp;#39;s decentralized they</text>
  <text start="272.15" dur="6.359">don&amp;#39;t have control over it so the Fed</text>
  <text start="275.659" dur="5.73">officials they don&amp;#39;t see a need or</text>
  <text start="278.509" dur="5.701">desire to issue a national</text>
  <text start="281.389" dur="5.791">cryptocurrency because they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="284.21" dur="7.34">centralized it it wouldn&amp;#39;t work in their</text>
  <text start="287.18" dur="7.949">system and you can see right now that</text>
  <text start="291.55" dur="7.149">the attack on cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="295.129" dur="5.76">where have you been watching them attack</text>
  <text start="298.699" dur="4.381">it they tell you that terrorists are</text>
  <text start="300.889" dur="3.09">using criminals are using it there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="303.08" dur="3.78">reason for that</text>
  <text start="303.979" dur="5">just like with gold and silver anything</text>
  <text start="306.86" dur="5.119">that comes up against their system</text>
  <text start="308.979" dur="6.79">anything that challenges their system</text>
  <text start="311.979" dur="7.42">they&amp;#39;re going to try to force everyone</text>
  <text start="315.769" dur="6.811">away from it and we can see moving</text>
  <text start="319.399" dur="6.211">forward and this is coming from Q gold</text>
  <text start="322.58" dur="4.229">is going to destroy the Fed now this</text>
  <text start="325.61" dur="3.869">doesn&amp;#39;t mean there&amp;#39;s not going to be a</text>
  <text start="326.809" dur="4.38">cryptocurrency it&amp;#39;s very difficult to</text>
  <text start="329.479" dur="6.36">carry around gold and things like that</text>
  <text start="331.189" dur="7.47">but gold is a confidence builder gold</text>
  <text start="335.839" dur="5.76">can be kept in the background while you</text>
  <text start="338.659" dur="6.84">use cryptocurrency as the currency of</text>
  <text start="341.599" dur="7.11">trade it is possible and guess what if</text>
  <text start="345.499" dur="5.22">you do this you don&amp;#39;t need a central</text>
  <text start="348.709" dur="4.29">bank system actually there&amp;#39;s no reason</text>
  <text start="350.719" dur="4.11">for a central bank system let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="352.999" dur="6.81">through some of the reasons why we</text>
  <text start="354.829" dur="8.07">really don&amp;#39;t need a central bank if we</text>
  <text start="359.809" dur="4.59">go back in time the greatest period of</text>
  <text start="362.899" dur="3.87">economic growth in history of the United</text>
  <text start="364.399" dur="5.07">States happened when there was no</text>
  <text start="366.769" dur="4.38">central bank did you know that the</text>
  <text start="369.469" dur="3.32">greatest period of economic growth in US</text>
  <text start="371.149" dur="6.03">history was between the Civil War and</text>
  <text start="372.789" dur="6.071">1913 and guess what that was a period</text>
  <text start="377.179" dur="5.84">when there was no central bank in the</text>
  <text start="378.86" dur="6.599">United States coming from WikiLeaks the</text>
  <text start="383.019" dur="4">Gilded Age saw the greatest period of</text>
  <text start="385.459" dur="4.47">economic growth in American history</text>
  <text start="387.019" dur="5.58">after the short-lived panic of 1873 the</text>
  <text start="389.929" dur="4.83">economy recovered with advent of hard</text>
  <text start="392.599" dur="6.27">money policies and industrialization</text>
  <text start="394.759" dur="7.32">from 1869 to 1879 the u.s. an economy</text>
  <text start="398.869" dur="6.3">grew at a rate of 6.8% for real GDP and</text>
  <text start="402.079" dur="6.42">4.5% for real GDP per capita</text>
  <text start="405.169" dur="5.85">despite the panic of 1873 the economy</text>
  <text start="408.499" dur="5.19">repeated this period growth in the 1880s</text>
  <text start="411.019" dur="5.01">in which the wealth of the nation grew</text>
  <text start="413.689" dur="4.88">at an annual rate of 3.8 percent while</text>
  <text start="416.029" dur="5.34">the GDP was also doubled</text>
  <text start="418.569" dur="5.02">so if our greatest period of economic</text>
  <text start="421.369" dur="6">prosperity was during a time when there</text>
  <text start="423.589" dur="4.951">is no Federal Reserve then why do we</text>
  <text start="427.369" dur="5.701">have the Fed</text>
  <text start="428.54" dur="7.14">Reserve I mean if we look at the u.s.</text>
  <text start="433.07" dur="5.15">dollar the Federal Reserve is</text>
  <text start="435.68" dur="5.73">systematically destroying the value of</text>
  <text start="438.22" dur="6.79">the Federal Reserve Note it continually</text>
  <text start="441.41" dur="6.96">lose value I mean since the 70s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="445.01" dur="5.97">down what 83% and since the beginning of</text>
  <text start="448.37" dur="4.65">time since I say the beginning of time</text>
  <text start="450.98" dur="6.66">the Federal Reserve Note back in 1913 it</text>
  <text start="453.02" dur="9.06">is down like what 96 96 97 % the Federal</text>
  <text start="457.64" dur="6.36">Reserve is a perpetual debt machine when</text>
  <text start="462.08" dur="3.87">the US government decides that it wants</text>
  <text start="464" dur="4.56">to spend another billion dollars that it</text>
  <text start="465.95" dur="4.62">doesn&amp;#39;t have it does not print up</text>
  <text start="468.56" dur="3.36">billions of dollars rather the US</text>
  <text start="470.57" dur="3.78">government creates a bunch of US</text>
  <text start="471.92" dur="4.35">Treasury bonds debt and takes them over</text>
  <text start="474.35" dur="3.81">to the Federal Reserve the Federal</text>
  <text start="476.27" dur="4.38">Reserve creates billions of dollars out</text>
  <text start="478.16" dur="7.32">of thin air and exchanges them for the</text>
  <text start="480.65" dur="8.13">US Treasury bonds so Thomas Edison and</text>
  <text start="485.48" dur="8.01">Henry Ford they couldn&amp;#39;t understand this</text>
  <text start="488.78" dur="7.65">why we adopted such a foolish system for</text>
  <text start="493.49" dur="4.2">example Thomas Edison once was quoted in</text>
  <text start="496.43" dur="4.41">the New York Times as saying the</text>
  <text start="497.69" dur="5.67">following that is to say under the old</text>
  <text start="500.84" dur="5.01">way any time we wish to add the national</text>
  <text start="503.36" dur="5.76">wealth we are compelled to add to the</text>
  <text start="505.85" dur="5.43">national debt now that is what Henry</text>
  <text start="509.12" dur="6.09">Ford wants to prevent he thinks it is</text>
  <text start="511.28" dur="6.449">stupid and so do i that for the loan of</text>
  <text start="515.21" dur="6.66">30 million of their own money the people</text>
  <text start="517.729" dur="6.571">of United Stated to pay 66 million</text>
  <text start="521.87" dur="5.67">dollars that is what it amounts to with</text>
  <text start="524.3" dur="6.54">interest people who will not turn a</text>
  <text start="527.54" dur="5.52">shovel of dirt nor contribute a pound of</text>
  <text start="530.84" dur="3.93">material will collect more money from</text>
  <text start="533.06" dur="4.14">the United States than will the people</text>
  <text start="534.77" dur="5.07">who supply the material and do the work</text>
  <text start="537.2" dur="5.88">that is the terrible thing about</text>
  <text start="539.84" dur="5.07">interest in all our great bond issues</text>
  <text start="543.08" dur="4.62">the interest is always greater than the</text>
  <text start="544.91" dur="5.61">principal all of the great public works</text>
  <text start="547.7" dur="5.55">cost more than twice the actual cost on</text>
  <text start="550.52" dur="4.2">that account under the present system of</text>
  <text start="553.25" dur="3.06">doing business we simply add a hundred</text>
  <text start="554.72" dur="4.77">and twenty one hundred fifty fifty</text>
  <text start="556.31" dur="6.06">percent to the state of cost but here is</text>
  <text start="559.49" dur="6.27">the point if our nation can issue</text>
  <text start="562.37" dur="5.76">dollar bond they can issue a dollar bill</text>
  <text start="565.76" dur="6.99">the element that makes the bond good</text>
  <text start="568.13" dur="8.43">makes the bill good the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="572.75" dur="5.79">also creates incredible bubbles you</text>
  <text start="576.56" dur="5.55">remember the dot-com bubble you remember</text>
  <text start="578.54" dur="7.62">the housing bubble all the bubbles going</text>
  <text start="582.11" dur="7.47">all the way back to 1913 they were ten</text>
  <text start="586.16" dur="7.23">different economic recessions since 1950</text>
  <text start="589.58" dur="6">and the Federal Reserve even omits that</text>
  <text start="593.39" dur="5.91">it helped create the Great Depression of</text>
  <text start="595.58" dur="6.15">1930 the Federal Reserve is also a</text>
  <text start="599.3" dur="7.7">privately owned corporation</text>
  <text start="601.73" dur="8.49">it gives secret bailouts to friends</text>
  <text start="607" dur="4.99">sixteen trillion dollars in secret loans</text>
