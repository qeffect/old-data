  <text start="165.92" dur="6.87">imploding right now the debt is way too</text>
  <text start="169.79" dur="5.75">high it cannot be sustained and they</text>
  <text start="172.79" dur="6.05">know this this is why Christine Lagarde</text>
  <text start="175.54" dur="8.32">Obama they&amp;#39;re all out there pushing</text>
  <text start="178.84" dur="7.39">taxes pushing plans to take your wealth</text>
  <text start="183.86" dur="5.85">a ten percent wealth tax a carbon tax</text>
  <text start="186.23" dur="6.27">and Obamacare text you name it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="189.71" dur="5.51">pushing taxes because they need to</text>
  <text start="192.5" dur="6.33">figure out a way to pay off this debt</text>
  <text start="195.22" dur="5.89">but guess what they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="198.83" dur="4.56">able to do it the economy is</text>
  <text start="201.11" dur="4.77">accelerating accelerating right now the</text>
  <text start="203.39" dur="5.31">economy is falling apart it&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="205.88" dur="6.42">worse and worse as time goes on and they</text>
  <text start="208.7" dur="5.88">know this and they cannot stop it I mean</text>
  <text start="212.3" dur="3.99">when we look at the unemployment we know</text>
  <text start="214.58" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re giving us these manipulating</text>
  <text start="216.29" dur="3.21">numbers is a five percent you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="217.85" dur="2.88">going to go down to 4.9 four point eight</text>
  <text start="219.5" dur="4.32">percent but it makes no sense whatsoever</text>
  <text start="220.73" dur="4.62">but when we look at this data some of</text>
  <text start="223.82" dur="5.94">the data wasn&amp;#39;t even mentioned in the</text>
  <text start="225.35" dur="7.859">corporate media the fact that 319,000</text>
  <text start="229.76" dur="6.99">part-time jobs for economic reasons were</text>
  <text start="233.209" dur="6.661">added in November while 375,000</text>
  <text start="236.75" dur="6.24">foreign-born workers found jobs in</text>
  <text start="239.87" dur="6.08">November a whopping 326,000 native-born</text>
  <text start="242.99" dur="7.17">Americans lost their jobs very</text>
  <text start="245.95" dur="8.83">interesting I mean when we look at this</text>
  <text start="250.16" dur="6.42">situation we understand why Obama wants</text>
  <text start="254.78" dur="4.14">more and more illegals coming into this</text>
  <text start="256.58" dur="4.55">country now I have nothing about nothing</text>
  <text start="258.92" dur="4.98">against people coming into this country</text>
  <text start="261.13" dur="7.51">this is what America is all about it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="263.9" dur="7.2">the melting pot yes but there&amp;#39;s certain</text>
  <text start="268.64" dur="3.84">procedures there are certain laws there</text>
  <text start="271.1" dur="3.72">are certain ways of getting into this</text>
  <text start="272.48" dur="5.13">country not just jumping over the border</text>
  <text start="274.82" dur="4.5">and saying ah I made it it doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="277.61" dur="4.32">like that and then having the government</text>
  <text start="279.32" dur="6.93">pick you up transport you over to a city</text>
  <text start="281.93" dur="7.83">give you working papers allow you to get</text>
  <text start="286.25" dur="7.32">student loans allowed you get auto loans</text>
  <text start="289.76" dur="6.9">allow you to get a job allow you</text>
  <text start="293.57" dur="3.69">eventually to go on to Obamacare if</text>
  <text start="296.66" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="297.26" dur="6.03">case why have borders it makes no sense</text>
  <text start="299.99" dur="5.43">at this point but of course they need</text>
  <text start="303.29" dur="5.7">this because they need more and more</text>
  <text start="305.42" dur="7.17">people in this country low paying</text>
  <text start="308.99" dur="7.17">workers to take out these loans people</text>
  <text start="312.59" dur="6.66">that never had any debt because right</text>
  <text start="316.16" dur="4.98">now the everyday man and woman in this</text>
  <text start="319.25" dur="5.55">country they&amp;#39;re tapped out they&amp;#39;re done</text>
  <text start="321.14" dur="6.54">and over the last eight years 2.7</text>
  <text start="324.8" dur="4.83">million foreign born Americans have</text>
  <text start="327.68" dur="3.33">found a job compared to only seven</text>
  <text start="329.63" dur="5.31">hundred and forty-seven thousand</text>
  <text start="331.01" dur="7.86">native-born that tells you something</text>
  <text start="334.94" dur="6.54">here that tells you this country is</text>
  <text start="338.87" dur="6.32">completely falling apart now of course</text>
  <text start="341.48" dur="5.64">the corporate media the government</text>
  <text start="345.19" dur="3.73">trying to convince you that we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="347.12" dur="3.27">this fantastic recovery this holiday</text>
  <text start="348.92" dur="3.6">season is going to be great we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="350.39" dur="5.88">already seen black friday complete</text>
  <text start="352.52" dur="5.46">disaster the numbers didn&amp;#39;t hit right</text>
  <text start="356.27" dur="3.3">now the retail association is saying</text>
  <text start="357.98" dur="5.25">that the retail sales the United States</text>
  <text start="359.57" dur="7.98">are likely to post a modest maybe point</text>
  <text start="363.23" dur="8.28">one percent month-on-month upward growth</text>
  <text start="367.55" dur="7.41">and when we look at this we see vehicle</text>
  <text start="371.51" dur="6.15">sales I slipped we know gasoline prices</text>
  <text start="374.96" dur="5.1">are continually coming down and when we</text>
  <text start="377.66" dur="5.25">look at Black Friday we know retail</text>
  <text start="380.06" dur="8.39">sales have fallen but when we look at</text>
  <text start="382.91" dur="5.54">cyber monday they have also declined</text>
  <text start="388.9" dur="9.4">since what we saw last year at the same</text>
  <text start="393.11" dur="8.66">time so last November cyber monday sales</text>
  <text start="398.3" dur="9.15">were better when unemployment was higher</text>
  <text start="401.77" dur="8.29">does that make any sense whatsoever no</text>
  <text start="407.45" dur="4.8">of course it doesn&amp;#39;t because what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="410.06" dur="5.63">happening here and we&amp;#39;ve been tracking</text>
  <text start="412.25" dur="7.26">this for a very long time going back to</text>
  <text start="415.69" dur="6.22">2008-2009 ten eleven twelve unemployment</text>
  <text start="419.51" dur="7.98">was much much higher but Black Friday</text>
  <text start="421.91" dur="9.27">Cyber Monday retail was stronger now as</text>
  <text start="427.49" dur="9.39">years have gone by unemployment has come</text>
  <text start="431.18" dur="9.54">down 76 now five percent and during this</text>
  <text start="436.88" dur="8.009">trend line down retail sales have been</text>
  <text start="440.72" dur="6.78">declining how can this be let&amp;#39;s use some</text>
  <text start="444.889" dur="6.301">common sense here if more people have</text>
  <text start="447.5" dur="6.9">work that means more people should be</text>
  <text start="451.19" dur="7.14">out shopping that means more people have</text>
  <text start="454.4" dur="5.639">funds coming in that means the economy</text>
  <text start="458.33" dur="5.55">is doing better but we&amp;#39;re not seeing any</text>
  <text start="460.039" dur="5.85">of this why because they&amp;#39;re not counting</text>
  <text start="463.88" dur="3.569">those people that fallen off they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="465.889" dur="5.791">counting those people that one from a</text>
  <text start="467.449" dur="9.741">full 80,000 60,000 $50,000 job to a</text>
  <text start="471.68" dur="7.68">part-time job of $25,000 20,000 15,000</text>
  <text start="477.19" dur="6.19">they&amp;#39;re not looking at that whatsoever</text>
  <text start="479.36" dur="6.899">and this is what we are seeing when we</text>
  <text start="483.38" dur="4.83">look at the real numbers when we look at</text>
  <text start="486.259" dur="4.291">what&amp;#39;s really going on not their</text>
  <text start="488.21" dur="5.01">manipulated numbers it makes perfect</text>
  <text start="490.55" dur="6.21">sense of what is happening we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="493.22" dur="6.29">to see many many more stores closed down</text>
  <text start="496.76" dur="6.48">we&amp;#39;re going to see an increase of</text>
  <text start="499.51" dur="7.33">layoffs coming up in 2016 it is going to</text>
  <text start="503.24" dur="6.48">be a complete disaster right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
