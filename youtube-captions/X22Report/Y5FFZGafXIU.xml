  <text start="174.45" dur="3.75">because of what&amp;#39;s happening in the</text>
  <text start="175.83" dur="4.68">eurozone of course they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="178.2" dur="5.28">the renewed crisis in the years the</text>
  <text start="180.51" dur="5.58">eurozone and what is happening in</text>
  <text start="183.48" dur="3.9">emerging markets in China now of course</text>
  <text start="186.09" dur="3.03">they always bring China into this</text>
  <text start="187.38" dur="4.32">because they need someone to blame and</text>
  <text start="189.12" dur="5.1">this is what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now now</text>
  <text start="191.7" dur="4.5">here in the United States we have the</text>
  <text start="194.22" dur="3.84">illusion that everything is fine that</text>
  <text start="196.2" dur="4.05">we&amp;#39;re in this fantastic recovery they</text>
  <text start="198.06" dur="5.28">came out on friday with the unemployment</text>
  <text start="200.25" dur="7.019">numbers of 5.1 percent i mean this is</text>
  <text start="203.34" dur="6.38">the lowest since april of 2008 but do we</text>
  <text start="207.269" dur="4.411">actually have anything close to full</text>
  <text start="209.72" dur="5.829">unemployment right now I mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="211.68" dur="7.83">they&amp;#39;re telling us that we do of course</text>
  <text start="215.549" dur="5.341">not the truth is that the only way</text>
  <text start="219.51" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;ve been able to get the official</text>
  <text start="220.89" dur="4.95">unemployment rate to steadily go down</text>
  <text start="222.84" dur="5.55">over the past few years is to get rid of</text>
  <text start="225.84" dur="7.89">those people who are still looking for</text>
  <text start="228.39" dur="7.8">jobs the fact is that 220,000 more</text>
  <text start="233.73" dur="5.94">Americans entered the workforce in</text>
  <text start="236.19" dur="5.16">august according to the survey a hundred</text>
  <text start="239.67" dur="4.319">and ninety six thousand more Americans</text>
  <text start="241.35" dur="4.59">were employed in the real in the real</text>
  <text start="243.989" dur="5.58">world this would result in the</text>
  <text start="245.94" dur="7.23">unemployment rate going up not in this</text>
  <text start="249.569" dur="7.98">strange world of central bankers they</text>
  <text start="253.17" dur="7.349">brought the unemployment down they</text>
  <text start="257.549" dur="6.601">expect us to believe that 261,000</text>
  <text start="260.519" dur="6.511">Americans of their own free will decided</text>
  <text start="264.15" dur="5.03">you know what I just don&amp;#39;t want to be in</text>
  <text start="267.03" dur="4.38">the workforce I don&amp;#39;t want that job</text>
  <text start="269.18" dur="3.85">because they don&amp;#39;t want to pay their</text>
  <text start="271.41" dur="4.05">bills they don&amp;#39;t want to feed their</text>
  <text start="273.03" dur="3.78">families they don&amp;#39;t want to keep a roof</text>
  <text start="275.46" dur="5.61">over their heads yeah they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="276.81" dur="7.35">any of that this is how ridiculous it is</text>
  <text start="281.07" dur="6.15">getting at this point what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="284.16" dur="6.89">throwing at us doesn&amp;#39;t even make sense</text>
  <text start="287.22" dur="7.379">anymore just listen to these statistics</text>
  <text start="291.05" dur="6.95">where we have the American citizen and</text>
  <text start="294.599" dur="6.091">we have the illegals in August</text>
  <text start="298" dur="5.64">a whopping six hundred and ninety eight</text>
  <text start="300.69" dur="8.38">thousand native-born Americans lost</text>
  <text start="303.64" dur="7.29">their jobs this drop was offset now I</text>
  <text start="309.07" dur="4.29">just before I said the next part here I</text>
  <text start="310.93" dur="6.54">just want to say these jobs were really</text>
  <text start="313.36" dur="6.66">well paying good jobs and we know from</text>
  <text start="317.47" dur="5.64">corporations from small corporations</text>
  <text start="320.02" dur="5.28">large and small we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of</text>
  <text start="323.11" dur="4.08">layoffs a lot of people losing their</text>
  <text start="325.3" dur="4.56">jobs and these are good jobs very</text>
  <text start="327.19" dur="5.31">difficult to find other jobs but they</text>
  <text start="329.86" dur="4.559">were able to offset the numbers with</text>
  <text start="332.5" dur="5.28">about two hundred and four thousand and</text>
  <text start="334.419" dur="5.401">these are foreign-born Americans who got</text>
  <text start="337.78" dur="5.88">a job in the month of August these are</text>
  <text start="339.82" dur="7.23">the low paying jobs so what do we see</text>
  <text start="343.66" dur="5.16">here well since december two thousand</text>
  <text start="347.05" dur="6.06">seven according to the household survey</text>
  <text start="348.82" dur="8.55">only 790,000 native-born American jobs</text>
  <text start="353.11" dur="6.51">have been added contrast that with 2.1</text>
  <text start="357.37" dur="5.1">million foreign born Americans who have</text>
  <text start="359.62" dur="4.62">found a job over the same time period</text>
  <text start="362.47" dur="5.1">this is a hundred and sixty-six percent</text>
  <text start="364.24" dur="6.84">more foreign-born workers added and what</text>
  <text start="367.57" dur="5.19">jobs are they taking the low paying work</text>
  <text start="371.08" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re getting rid of the high paid jobs</text>
  <text start="372.76" dur="5.52">and we have all these low paying jobs</text>
  <text start="375.4" dur="6.09">where basically they&amp;#39;re taking up the</text>
  <text start="378.28" dur="7.35">slack so what&amp;#39;s happening here in</text>
  <text start="381.49" dur="7.71">America won&amp;#39;t we&amp;#39;ve been seeing it for a</text>
  <text start="385.63" dur="6.84">long long time all the jobs all the good</text>
  <text start="389.2" dur="6.84">jobs are being sent overseas what do we</text>
  <text start="392.47" dur="5.28">have left here waitresses bartenders and</text>
  <text start="396.04" dur="3.93">I have nothing against these jobs</text>
  <text start="397.75" dur="5.12">whatsoever or the people who do it did</text>
  <text start="399.97" dur="6.9">this is hard work but this is not a</text>
  <text start="402.87" dur="9.46">manufacturing production country anymore</text>
  <text start="406.87" dur="10.89">a country cannot survive on waiters and</text>
  <text start="412.33" dur="11.04">bartenders it just can&amp;#39;t happen and we</text>
  <text start="417.76" dur="8.4">know at this point this economy cannot</text>
  <text start="423.37" dur="6.72">be sustained on this it will not work</text>
  <text start="426.16" dur="5.68">and we see across the economy all the</text>
  <text start="430.09" dur="5.4">bubbles that they set up the</text>
  <text start="431.84" dur="6.21">student loan bubble the housing bubble</text>
  <text start="435.49" dur="5.82">the stock market bubble the Treasury</text>
  <text start="438.05" dur="6.839">bond bubble the automobile bubble is</text>
  <text start="441.31" dur="5.169">about to pop I mean if we look at the</text>
  <text start="444.889" dur="4.051">automobile bubble right now the</text>
  <text start="446.479" dur="4.741">automaker&amp;#39;s they just unleashed a</text>
  <text start="448.94" dur="5.46">massive production surge to keep the</text>
  <text start="451.22" dur="6.54">dream alive with inventories at a record</text>
  <text start="454.4" dur="6.69">high and this is risen for 61 straight</text>
  <text start="457.76" dur="6.659">months in a row it all this would be</text>
  <text start="461.09" dur="6.84">fine if sales were keeping up against</text>
  <text start="464.419" dur="6.301">what they are not sales are not keeping</text>
  <text start="467.93" dur="4.59">up with the inventories edmunds.com</text>
  <text start="470.72" dur="3.72">estimates that around twenty eight</text>

  <text start="474.44" dur="8.07">be leased this is a new record pace</text>
  <text start="478.22" dur="5.55">which means 13.4 million vehicles least</text>
  <text start="482.51" dur="3.96">over the past three years in the u.s.</text>
  <text start="483.77" dur="5.91">compared with just seven million in the</text>
  <text start="486.47" dur="7.79">three years to 2011 are set to spark a</text>
  <text start="489.68" dur="7.29">massive surplus of high-quality vehicles</text>
  <text start="494.26" dur="5.8">so we&amp;#39;re going to see inventories of</text>
  <text start="496.97" dur="7.23">luxury high quality used cars at record</text>
  <text start="500.06" dur="7.25">highs and prices are tumbling we just</text>
  <text start="504.2" dur="8.43">saw a saw a surge in production and</text>
  <text start="507.31" dur="7.39">channel stuffing into dealer lots what</text>
  <text start="512.63" dur="5.459">comes next mom that&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="514.7" dur="7.98">production slump manufacturing is going</text>
  <text start="518.089" dur="7.171">to decline I mean think about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="522.68" dur="6.15">happening here everything they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="525.26" dur="5.67">to keep this bubble alive is going to</text>
  <text start="528.83" dur="6.12">come to an end just like the housing</text>
  <text start="530.93" dur="7.77">bubble did in 2008 just like the stock</text>
  <text start="534.95" dur="6.23">market bubble in 2008 came to an end all</text>
  <text start="538.7" dur="6.66">these bubbles that the central bank has</text>

  <text start="547.22" dur="4.86">market right now where it was hitting</text>
  <text start="550.1" dur="4.02">all-time new highs has come down</text>
