  <text start="52.63" dur="4.8">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="56.17" dur="4.95">rapport my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="57.43" dur="6.15">episode 1680 a.n today&amp;#39;s date is October</text>
  <text start="61.12" dur="5.01">3rd 2018 and the thought of the episode</text>
  <text start="63.58" dur="5.64">is the beginning indicator that signals</text>
  <text start="66.13" dur="5.88">the end of the Fed let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="69.22" dur="4.71">economic collapse financial news now at</text>
  <text start="72.01" dur="2.67">this point we understand that everything</text>
  <text start="73.93" dur="2.97">is in motion</text>
  <text start="74.68" dur="5.28">there are many different plans but</text>
  <text start="76.9" dur="5.37">there&amp;#39;s one umbrella plan that they are</text>
  <text start="79.96" dur="4.11">working on and the umbrella plan is to</text>
  <text start="82.27" dur="4.38">get rid of the central banking</text>
  <text start="84.07" dur="5.159">establishment and what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="86.65" dur="4.8">right now is they&amp;#39;re taking out certain</text>
  <text start="89.229" dur="4.591">operatives and eventually they will end</text>
  <text start="91.45" dur="4.94">up removing the central bank we need to</text>
  <text start="93.82" dur="4.799">remember that Trump when he took office</text>
  <text start="96.39" dur="4.21">he took Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="98.619" dur="4.171">he hung Andrew Jackson on the wall</text>
  <text start="100.6" dur="4.17">inside of his office and we need to</text>
  <text start="102.79" dur="4.98">understand that Andrew Jackson he</text>
  <text start="104.77" dur="4.8">campaigned on getting rid of the central</text>
  <text start="107.77" dur="3.78">bank and that&amp;#39;s exactly what he did</text>
  <text start="109.57" dur="4.62">of course they tried to assassinate him</text>
  <text start="111.55" dur="5.76">but it didn&amp;#39;t work and for many many</text>
  <text start="114.19" dur="6.239">years there was no central bank and I</text>
  <text start="117.31" dur="5.339">believe that&amp;#39;s why Trump has taken</text>
  <text start="120.429" dur="4.8">Andrew Jackson and put him on the wall</text>
  <text start="122.649" dur="5.61">we also have to understand Trump did</text>
  <text start="125.229" dur="5.371">something when he wasn&amp;#39;t yet president</text>
  <text start="128.259" dur="6.091">while he was running he did something</text>
  <text start="130.6" dur="5.01">that almost no other president has done</text>
  <text start="134.35" dur="5.43">actually I take that back</text>
  <text start="135.61" dur="6.81">there was one other president but didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="139.78" dur="4.679">comply completely and we&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="142.42" dur="4.02">into this a little bit later but I first</text>
  <text start="144.459" dur="4.801">wanted to start with the economy here</text>
  <text start="146.44" dur="5.1">and talk about what is happening and</text>
  <text start="149.26" dur="4.11">what we see breaking down and why the</text>
  <text start="151.54" dur="3.57">manipulation is so important remember</text>
  <text start="153.37" dur="5.91">the economy right now is being</text>
  <text start="155.11" dur="6.23">manipulated using the central bank the</text>
  <text start="159.28" dur="5.64">deep state manipulation guide and</text>
  <text start="161.34" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re continuing their process to make</text>
  <text start="164.92" dur="5.25">the economy look fantastic of course</text>
  <text start="167.34" dur="4.81">they&amp;#39;ve taken the manipulation and they</text>
  <text start="170.17" dur="4.8">revved it up to make it look even better</text>
  <text start="172.15" dur="4.199">than the than it was before and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="174.97" dur="2.97">trying to make the economy look and</text>
  <text start="176.349" dur="3.931">absolutely incredible</text>
  <text start="177.94" dur="5.46">there&amp;#39;s a reason for all of this they</text>
  <text start="180.28" dur="5.46">need to do this because they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="183.4" dur="3">ready to take down the central bank</text>
  <text start="185.74" dur="4.589">system</text>
  <text start="186.4" dur="5.6">and they&amp;#39;re preparing to control the</text>
  <text start="190.329" dur="5.88">narrative that&amp;#39;s what this is about</text>
  <text start="192" dur="7.569">to control the narrative you need to</text>
  <text start="196.209" dur="7.681">maneuver your way in so the mainstream</text>
  <text start="199.569" dur="6.571">media the deep state can&amp;#39;t blame you for</text>
  <text start="203.89" dur="4.5">bringing down the economy and this is</text>
  <text start="206.14" dur="3.75">exactly what Trump the Patriots this is</text>
  <text start="208.39" dur="3.209">what they&amp;#39;re doing right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="209.89" dur="3.45">manipulating everything so this way the</text>
  <text start="211.599" dur="3.75">deep state the mainstream media can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="213.34" dur="3.33">turn around and say oh it was because of</text>
  <text start="215.349" dur="3.841">your policies and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="216.67" dur="6.51">seeing now when we look at this data</text>
  <text start="219.19" dur="6.57">like ADP we see that September saw a</text>
  <text start="223.18" dur="7.47">rebound now August was completely</text>
  <text start="225.76" dur="7.319">revised to a-plus 168,000 they fiddled</text>
  <text start="230.65" dur="5.699">with the numbers and they got the</text>
  <text start="233.079" dur="5.091">September numbers up to 230 they</text>
  <text start="236.349" dur="4.11">expected a hundred and eighty four and</text>
  <text start="238.17" dur="4.42">this is the strongest monthly job gains</text>
  <text start="240.459" dur="5.851">since February now a lot of the jobs</text>
  <text start="242.59" dur="6.06">were service jobs now we understand that</text>
  <text start="246.31" dur="3.75">there&amp;#39;s the mat that manufacturing</text>
  <text start="248.65" dur="3.479">hasn&amp;#39;t been brought back to United</text>
  <text start="250.06" dur="4.17">States there&amp;#39;s a couple manufacturers</text>
  <text start="252.129" dur="3.871">here and there in the United States but</text>
  <text start="254.23" dur="3.869">millions and millions of people are</text>
  <text start="256" dur="5.039">completely out of work because a lot of</text>
  <text start="258.099" dur="5.011">the factories were moved out of this</text>
  <text start="261.039" dur="5.221">country this was the globalists deep</text>
  <text start="263.11" dur="5.1">state plan and it&amp;#39;s going to take some</text>
  <text start="266.26" dur="3.48">time to bring them back but you need to</text>
  <text start="268.21" dur="4.32">set up the infrastructure you need to</text>
  <text start="269.74" dur="4.53">set up the agreements before you can</text>
  <text start="272.53" dur="4.169">bring everything back and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="274.27" dur="5.19">we&amp;#39;re doing right now getting rid of the</text>
  <text start="276.699" dur="4.53">TPP we negotiating the NAFTA agreement</text>
  <text start="279.46" dur="4.32">which I believe is going to be</text>
  <text start="281.229" dur="3.81">renegotiated once again I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="283.78" dur="3.81">going to bring this up and eventually</text>
  <text start="285.039" dur="5.461">completely do away with it and probably</text>
  <text start="287.59" dur="4.049">just go with a brand new agreement but</text>
  <text start="290.5" dur="2.37">it was a little too difficult in the</text>
  <text start="291.639" dur="3.981">beginning because Congress had to get</text>
  <text start="292.87" dur="4.829">involved to unwind this and at the time</text>
  <text start="295.62" dur="4.24">Trump with the pave just they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="297.699" dur="4.351">have the power to do this so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="299.86" dur="5.549">seeing right now is everything is being</text>
  <text start="302.05" dur="6.39">prepped for when we move out of this</text>
  <text start="305.409" dur="5.221">central banking system and we can see a</text>
  <text start="308.44" dur="3.75">lot of fluctuations in the stats and</text>
  <text start="310.63" dur="5.009">what&amp;#39;s really going on I mean look at US</text>
  <text start="312.19" dur="5.88">service economy I mean this is all over</text>
  <text start="315.639" dur="4.471">the place market US service PMI dropped</text>
  <text start="318.07" dur="5.25">to fifty three point five Louis</text>
  <text start="320.11" dur="5.1">since January ICA is M us service</text>
  <text start="323.32" dur="4.86">explodes to sixty one point six the</text>
  <text start="325.21" dur="4.62">highest ins August of 1997 market us</text>
  <text start="328.18" dur="5.28">manufacturing rose to fifty five point</text>
  <text start="329.83" dur="5.34">six the highest since May and is M us</text>
  <text start="333.46" dur="4.71">manufacturing dropped to fifty nine</text>
  <text start="335.17" dur="4.83">point eight I mean these numbers are</text>
  <text start="338.17" dur="5.82">reporting the opposite on the same</text>
  <text start="340" dur="6.69">things it&amp;#39;s absolutely crazy but when we</text>
  <text start="343.99" dur="4.26">look at what is happening at the level</text>
  <text start="346.69" dur="3.99">of the people&amp;#39;s economy and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="348.25" dur="4.05">talking about all these surveys and all</text>
  <text start="350.68" dur="3.99">these other statistics and things like</text>
  <text start="352.3" dur="4.68">that I&amp;#39;m talking about real hard</text>
  <text start="354.67" dur="5.52">evidence that there&amp;#39;s something wrong</text>
  <text start="356.98" dur="5.16">with the economy remember this is not a</text>
  <text start="360.19" dur="4.71">people&amp;#39;s economy I know people want this</text>
  <text start="362.14" dur="4.56">economy to get better if we make this</text>
  <text start="364.9" dur="4.35">economy better we&amp;#39;re still stuck with</text>
  <text start="366.7" dur="4.74">the central bank the central bank is</text>
  <text start="369.25" dur="4.44">still going to issue debt it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="371.44" dur="4.47">loan it to the government the people are</text>
  <text start="373.69" dur="4.47">gonna have to pay taxes to pay for this</text>
  <text start="375.91" dur="4.56">debt the value of the dollar is going to</text>
  <text start="378.16" dur="4.8">continually decrease this is not a</text>
  <text start="380.47" dur="4.68">system for the people we need to break</text>
  <text start="382.96" dur="7.41">free of this but when we look at real</text>
  <text start="385.15" dur="7.38">data we can see that the inner workings</text>
  <text start="390.37" dur="5.61">of this central bank economy is</text>
  <text start="392.53" dur="6.12">completely falling apart over twenty</text>
  <text start="395.98" dur="4.17">major retailers have filed for</text>
  <text start="398.65" dur="4.62">bankruptcy since the beginning of last</text>
  <text start="400.15" dur="4.32">year and in 2018 most likely we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="403.27" dur="4.41">break this record and we&amp;#39;re getting very</text>
  <text start="404.47" dur="6.62">very close I mean think about it retail</text>
  <text start="407.68" dur="8.04">giants Sears JC Penney&amp;#39;s Toys R Us</text>
  <text start="411.09" dur="6.88">Brookstone mattress firm either file</text>
  <text start="415.72" dur="4.92">bankruptcy or they&amp;#39;re headed towards</text>
  <text start="417.97" dur="6.6">bankruptcy and they&amp;#39;re just just a hair</text>
  <text start="420.64" dur="5.97">length away from being bankrupt mattress</text>
  <text start="424.57" dur="5.22">firm has approximately thousand</text>
  <text start="426.61" dur="4.74">brick-and-mortar locations and a lot of</text>
  <text start="429.79" dur="1.92">the stores are being closed down right</text>
  <text start="431.35" dur="2.82">now</text>
  <text start="431.71" dur="4.65">Brookstone it seems like Brookstone had</text>
  <text start="434.17" dur="3.78">an outlet in every mall I mean I</text>
  <text start="436.36" dur="2.55">remember when I was younger every time</text>
  <text start="437.95" dur="2.7">you go to the mall you could see</text>
  <text start="438.91" dur="3.42">Brookstone well they filed for</text>
  <text start="440.65" dur="3.98">bankruptcy and all the remaining mall</text>
  <text start="442.33" dur="4.41">stores will be shut down</text>
  <text start="444.63" dur="4.87">Sears they don&amp;#39;t like to call it</text>

  <text start="453.47" dur="6.06">Astor Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond not bankrupt</text>
  <text start="455.93" dur="4.32">just yet but their sales are continually</text>
  <text start="459.53" dur="2.79">declining</text>
  <text start="460.25" dur="4.02">and it&amp;#39;s disastrous for them and</text>
  <text start="462.32" dur="3.99">eventually probably right after this</text>
  <text start="464.27" dur="6.09">holiday season they&amp;#39;re gonna file for</text>
  <text start="466.31" dur="7.74">bankruptcy Walmart Target they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="470.36" dur="5.22">okay right now but they they know that</text>
  <text start="474.05" dur="3.57">this holiday season is not going to be</text>
  <text start="475.58" dur="3.54">that great and they&amp;#39;re turning</text>
  <text start="477.62" dur="3.72">everything around and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="479.12" dur="3.63">blame it on the tariffs remember in the</text>
  <text start="481.34" dur="3.03">past they blamed everything on the</text>
  <text start="482.75" dur="2.52">weather then they said it was online</text>
  <text start="484.37" dur="2.97">sales</text>
  <text start="485.27" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s why Walmart wasn&amp;#39;t doing well</text>
  <text start="487.34" dur="3.48">that&amp;#39;s why target wasn&amp;#39;t doing well now</text>
  <text start="489.08" dur="3.87">all of a sudden online sales don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="490.82" dur="4.41">matter now it&amp;#39;s the tariffs that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="492.95" dur="4.44">reason why retail sales are not doing</text>
  <text start="495.23" dur="4.85">well and yes we import a lot from other</text>
  <text start="497.39" dur="5.04">countries but if something goes up 10%</text>
  <text start="500.08" dur="4">people are still going to I mean if</text>
  <text start="502.43" dur="3.57">people have jobs and people have money</text>
  <text start="504.08" dur="5.39">they&amp;#39;re still gonna purchase the item</text>
  <text start="506" dur="6.659">and right now they&amp;#39;re getting ready to</text>
  <text start="509.47" dur="6.43">explain away why their sales aren&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="512.659" dur="6.421">great and when we see all these stores</text>
  <text start="515.9" dur="6.68">closing we have to understand this means</text>
  <text start="519.08" dur="7.1">there&amp;#39;s a huge vacancy rate in the US</text>
  <text start="522.58" dur="9.1">the shopping malls they hit the highest</text>
  <text start="526.18" dur="9.34">level for vacancy in six years it&amp;#39;s hit</text>
  <text start="531.68" dur="8.7">eight point six last quarter this is the</text>
  <text start="535.52" dur="7.2">highest since the end of 2012 so this is</text>
  <text start="540.38" dur="3.62">not a good situation it&amp;#39;s getting worse</text>
  <text start="542.72" dur="4.02">and worse</text>
  <text start="544" dur="4.48">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting we know the</text>

  <text start="548.48" dur="4.26">know that the S P is our all-time highs</text>
  <text start="550.25" dur="6.45">and when it&amp;#39;s happening now is kind of</text>

  <text start="644.519" dur="11.581">to come down look back in time 1966 1968</text>
  <text start="648.169" dur="11.38">1972 2000 2007 2015 what happened the</text>
  <text start="656.1" dur="6.929">market came down people lost quite a bit</text>
  <text start="659.549" dur="7.83">and this happens over and over and over</text>
  <text start="663.029" dur="7.951">and this is a warning to everyone and we</text>
  <text start="667.379" dur="6.42">know that this needs to stop and this is</text>
  <text start="670.98" dur="5.459">what Trump the Patriots are trying to do</text>
  <text start="673.799" dur="4.051">right now and we can see that with this</text>
  <text start="676.439" dur="3.81">New York Times article where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="677.85" dur="4.589">going back 20 years and saying that you</text>
  <text start="680.249" dur="4.351">know Trump was involved in tax fraud</text>
  <text start="682.439" dur="4.291">with his father of course this is a hit</text>
  <text start="684.6" dur="4.38">piece but it it started me to think</text>
  <text start="686.73" dur="4.889">about what Trump did before he was</text>
  <text start="688.98" dur="5.43">president when Trump was a candidate and</text>
  <text start="691.619" dur="4.47">he was running for president he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="694.41" dur="2.909">want to show his tax return now of</text>
  <text start="696.089" dur="4.62">course the mainstream media and the rest</text>
  <text start="697.319" dur="5.341">gave him a lot of crap about this and I</text>
  <text start="700.709" dur="5.55">can see why he didn&amp;#39;t want to do this</text>
  <text start="702.66" dur="6.539">because in his mind he knew that these</text>
  <text start="706.259" dur="7.44">taxes the Federal Reserve completely</text>
  <text start="709.199" dur="7.62">illegal I mean think about it when the</text>
  <text start="713.699" dur="5.88">Constitution was created did presidents</text>
  <text start="716.819" dur="4.501">come in and show their tax return who</text>
  <text start="719.579" dur="5.31">was the first president</text>
  <text start="721.32" dur="7.379">did this Nixon he was involved in</text>
  <text start="724.889" dur="6.421">Watergate and to show everyone that he</text>
  <text start="728.699" dur="7.531">was on the up and up he showed his tax</text>
  <text start="731.31" dur="6.63">return now Gerald Ford he decided he</text>
  <text start="736.23" dur="5.549">wasn&amp;#39;t going to show his tax return</text>
  <text start="737.94" dur="8.1">instead he released a public summary</text>
  <text start="741.779" dur="7.62">which is not the same as a tax form now</text>
  <text start="746.04" dur="9.87">every president since then showed his or</text>
  <text start="749.399" dur="9">her tax records and of course when</text>
  <text start="755.91" dur="4.739">Clinton was running she showed all her</text>
  <text start="758.399" dur="4.68">tax records but it they&amp;#39;re meaningless</text>
  <text start="760.649" dur="5.49">because when you&amp;#39;re going through your</text>
  <text start="763.079" dur="5.641">foundations you can hide all that money</text>
  <text start="766.139" dur="4.351">and when you present your tax returns it</text>
  <text start="768.72" dur="3.63">looks like look I hardly make any money</text>
  <text start="770.49" dur="4.86">everything&amp;#39;s on the up-and-up I mean</text>
  <text start="772.35" dur="7.08">people do this every day they create an</text>
  <text start="775.35" dur="6.45">LLC they run all the funds through the</text>
  <text start="779.43" dur="6">LLC they might take a very small salary</text>
  <text start="781.8" dur="5.46">and their tax returns look fantastic but</text>
  <text start="785.43" dur="4.11">again you don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="787.26" dur="3.689">with the LLC but that&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="789.54" dur="3.239">completely separate and apart the same</text>
  <text start="790.949" dur="6.51">thing with the politicians they use</text>
  <text start="792.779" dur="7.29">foundations so Trump decided not to show</text>
  <text start="797.459" dur="7.171">his tax returns and I believe this was a</text>
  <text start="800.069" dur="7.95">signal saying I&amp;#39;m resisting and I object</text>
  <text start="804.63" dur="7.069">to the central bank system the deep</text>
  <text start="808.019" dur="7.651">state system and I am NOT going to abide</text>
  <text start="811.699" dur="7.57">by any of this and I think this was the</text>
  <text start="815.67" dur="7.919">first step of letting everyone know he</text>
  <text start="819.269" dur="8.31">does not agree with the Fed IRS and</text>
  <text start="823.589" dur="8.31">everything else and you can see just by</text>
  <text start="827.579" dur="6.271">that action the mainstream media the</text>
  <text start="831.899" dur="7.471">deep state the central bank</text>
  <text start="833.85" dur="8.489">they completely flipped out why I mean</text>
  <text start="839.37" dur="5.81">does showing your tax records mean that</text>
  <text start="842.339" dur="6.12">you&amp;#39;re a good person or a bad person</text>
  <text start="845.18" dur="6.07">it&amp;#39;s meaningless it doesn&amp;#39;t show that</text>
  <text start="848.459" dur="5.971">you&amp;#39;re a patriot actually it shows the</text>
  <text start="851.25" dur="3.53">opposite I would think because as we</text>
  <text start="854.43" dur="3.67">know</text>
  <text start="854.78" dur="8.01">when did this all start to happen in</text>
  <text start="858.1" dur="7.24">1913 what happened then the central bank</text>
  <text start="862.79" dur="5.67">was signed into law many people say that</text>
  <text start="865.34" dur="5.52">it was never really ratified and maybe</text>
  <text start="868.46" dur="3.75">we should look into this maybe it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="870.86" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re saying that all the states did</text>
  <text start="872.21" dur="6.48">not agree but they went ahead with it</text>
  <text start="874.91" dur="4.98">anyhow and the central bank if you look</text>
  <text start="878.69" dur="3.54">back in history I&amp;#39;m not gonna go through</text>
  <text start="879.89" dur="5.79">the whole history but they continually</text>
  <text start="882.23" dur="6.21">tried to get into countries where they</text>
  <text start="885.68" dur="5.16">are not and they try over and over in in</text>
  <text start="888.44" dur="4.44">the United States for instance it was</text>
  <text start="890.84" dur="4.26">the central bank number one the central</text>
  <text start="892.88" dur="3.81">bank number two Andrew Jackson got rid</text>
  <text start="895.1" dur="3.27">of it then they came up with the Federal</text>
  <text start="896.69" dur="4.14">Reserve and they went through different</text>
  <text start="898.37" dur="6.12">names like the federal cartel but that</text>
  <text start="900.83" dur="5.07">sounded illegal sounded like a mob type</text>
  <text start="904.49" dur="3.18">of thing so they changed it to the</text>
  <text start="905.9" dur="3.48">reserve to make it seem like it was part</text>
  <text start="907.67" dur="5.48">of the government which it is not it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="909.38" dur="8.46">separate corporation so just by Trump</text>
  <text start="913.15" dur="8.8">saying no we&amp;#39;re not doing this tells us</text>
  <text start="917.84" dur="6.3">that he is prepared and ready to go up</text>
  <text start="921.95" dur="4.11">against the central bank to go up</text>
  <text start="924.14" dur="5.07">against the system and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="926.06" dur="4.35">right now is exactly that</text>
  <text start="929.21" dur="3.12">listen everyone thanks a lot for</text>
