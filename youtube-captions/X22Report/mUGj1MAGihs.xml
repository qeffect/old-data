  <text start="267.229" dur="5.431">together and it looks like it is</text>
  <text start="270.44" dur="6.18">happening and this is going to be a</text>
  <text start="272.66" dur="6.6">problem for the central bank the EU here</text>
  <text start="276.62" dur="5.549">in the United States we see that the</text>
  <text start="279.26" dur="5.92">Patriots are in complete control of the</text>
  <text start="282.169" dur="7">economic narrative Trump</text>
  <text start="285.18" dur="7.019">is continually pushing out the message</text>
  <text start="289.169" dur="6.47">that there&amp;#39;s going to be a China trade</text>
  <text start="292.199" dur="6.301">deal the Chinese let it slip that</text>
  <text start="295.639" dur="4.931">tariffs will be phased out I do believe</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="6.32">that this was all part of the plan to</text>
  <text start="300.57" dur="6.87">set up the IMF the biz the Rothschilds</text>
  <text start="304.82" dur="4.75">remember their whole entire argument</text>
  <text start="307.44" dur="4.44">about why the global economy is slowing</text>
  <text start="309.57" dur="6.75">it&amp;#39;s because of the trade wars is</text>
  <text start="311.88" dur="6.27">because of the tariffs but once again we</text>
  <text start="316.32" dur="4.56">have to remember that their entire plan</text>
  <text start="318.15" dur="4.47">the globalist plan was to shift</text>
  <text start="320.88" dur="3.03">everything away from the United States</text>
  <text start="322.62" dur="2.54">this is why they&amp;#39;ve been working so hard</text>
  <text start="323.91" dur="4.47">for many many years</text>
  <text start="325.16" dur="5.8">shifting manufacturing shifting the</text>
  <text start="328.38" dur="5.49">businesses out of the US having these</text>
  <text start="330.96" dur="5.19">lopsided trade deals that didn&amp;#39;t benefit</text>
  <text start="333.87" dur="5.82">the US or the people of the United</text>
  <text start="336.15" dur="6.359">States to actually hurt the country now</text>
  <text start="339.69" dur="6.84">Trump and the Patriots they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="342.509" dur="5.16">new trade deals even trade deals we need</text>
  <text start="346.53" dur="5.58">to understand something</text>
  <text start="347.669" dur="7.53">very very important that once the u.s.</text>
  <text start="352.11" dur="6.44">the Federal Reserve Note is no longer</text>
  <text start="355.199" dur="6.391">the reserve currency of the world</text>
  <text start="358.55" dur="5.049">countries will no longer hold the</text>
  <text start="361.59" dur="3.66">Federal Reserve Note they will since</text>
  <text start="363.599" dur="3.271">they&amp;#39;re not going to hold it there they</text>
  <text start="365.25" dur="4.02">won&amp;#39;t be able to use it to buy goods</text>
  <text start="366.87" dur="5.49">here in the US we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="369.27" dur="6.48">have trade deals and they can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="372.36" dur="6.809">lopsided trade deals where the benefit</text>
  <text start="375.75" dur="7.289">goes to the other country it has to be</text>
  <text start="379.169" dur="7.141">even trade fair trade and this is why</text>
  <text start="383.039" dur="5.581">Trump has been pushing China so hard he</text>
  <text start="386.31" dur="5.579">tweeted out the following the Chinese</text>
  <text start="388.62" dur="5.82">say about Trump trade war in tariffs he</text>
  <text start="391.889" dur="4.53">brought us to the table this is the most</text>
  <text start="394.44" dur="4.08">prosperous economy the world has ever</text>
  <text start="396.419" dur="5.28">seen and it&amp;#39;s going to be a very</text>
  <text start="398.52" dur="4.829">prosperous economy Jamie Dimon on 60</text>
  <text start="401.699" dur="5.671">minutes Thank You President Trump and</text>
  <text start="403.349" dur="6.311">the Republican Party Trump and the</text>
  <text start="407.37" dur="8.67">Patriots right now</text>
  <text start="409.66" dur="10.68">they are re working the entire globalist</text>
  <text start="416.04" dur="6.97">system and when Trump is letting</text>
  <text start="420.34" dur="5.85">everyone know that the economy is going</text>
  <text start="423.01" dur="5.28">to be the most prosperous economy it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="426.19" dur="6.03">going to be the most prosperous economy</text>
  <text start="428.29" dur="6.06">without the central bank because how</text>
  <text start="432.22" dur="4.89">else can you make a prosperous economy</text>
  <text start="434.35" dur="5.64">if you have a private western central</text>
  <text start="437.11" dur="5.88">bank that&amp;#39;s creating currency with</text>
  <text start="439.99" dur="6.63">interest attached the economy cannot</text>
  <text start="442.99" dur="8.19">prosper you always have that debt right</text>
  <text start="446.62" dur="6.78">now the United States has over 23</text>
  <text start="451.18" dur="4.14">trillion dollars worth of debt now if</text>
  <text start="453.4" dur="4.02">you add in all the unfunded liabilities</text>
  <text start="455.32" dur="6.99">all the hidden debt and everything else</text>
  <text start="457.42" dur="8.16">it&amp;#39;s much much larger than that so even</text>
  <text start="462.31" dur="5.85">if the US is making a profit right now</text>
  <text start="465.58" dur="5.12">we have the debt take your own household</text>
  <text start="468.16" dur="6.18">for instance if you&amp;#39;re bringing in</text>
  <text start="470.7" dur="7.57">$50,000 a year and you have your home</text>
  <text start="474.34" dur="5.13">which is say 250,000 and that is all</text>
  <text start="478.27" dur="5.01">debt because you had to take out a</text>
  <text start="479.47" dur="7.08">mortgage you have an automobile or maybe</text>
  <text start="483.28" dur="5.82">two of them and you lease them or</text>
  <text start="486.55" dur="5.49">finance them that is debt you really</text>
  <text start="489.1" dur="4.43">don&amp;#39;t own it until you pay it off well</text>
  <text start="492.04" dur="3.87">at least you&amp;#39;re just renting actually</text>
  <text start="493.53" dur="6.94">then if you have all the credit cards</text>
  <text start="495.91" dur="8.42">and you have balances of 5 or 10 or 15</text>
  <text start="500.47" dur="7.2">thousand and you&amp;#39;re bringing in 50</text>
  <text start="504.33" dur="6.07">you&amp;#39;re not prosperous you have the debt</text>
  <text start="507.67" dur="6.929">it&amp;#39;s the same thing with this country</text>
  <text start="510.4" dur="7.079">and the only way to be prosperous is to</text>
  <text start="514.599" dur="6.531">remove the private western central bank</text>
  <text start="517.479" dur="8.881">is to remove the debt part of it and</text>
  <text start="521.13" dur="10.06">that&amp;#39;s what the Patriots are planning to</text>
  <text start="526.36" dur="7.79">do it&amp;#39;s the only way forward the next</text>
  <text start="531.19" dur="6.72">step is going to be very interesting and</text>
  <text start="534.15" dur="5.5">that is coming up very very soon we see</text>
  <text start="537.91" dur="4.26">already that Trump of the Patriots</text>
  <text start="539.65" dur="7.17">they&amp;#39;re already starting to attack</text>
  <text start="542.17" dur="8.19">the central bank and once we get to a</text>
  <text start="546.82" dur="4.17">certain point everyone will notice the</text>
  <text start="550.36" dur="3.93">attacks</text>
  <text start="550.99" dur="6.48">I remember going back a year or two when</text>
  <text start="554.29" dur="6">Trump initially came out and said the</text>
  <text start="557.47" dur="4.38">Fed should lower rates and we were</text>
  <text start="560.29" dur="5.07">talking about how Trump is going to</text>
  <text start="561.85" dur="6.39">continue pointing at the Fed continue to</text>
  <text start="565.36" dur="6.27">tweet out about the Fed and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="568.24" dur="7.41">to accelerate as time goes on and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="571.63" dur="8.37">exactly what we&amp;#39;ve seen now we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="575.65" dur="10.67">see the other side now since Trump owns</text>
  <text start="580" dur="10.2">the economy once he&amp;#39;s reelected in 2020</text>
  <text start="586.32" dur="6.67">the gloves are gonna come off the next</text>
  <text start="590.2" dur="4.98">wave the next attack on the central bank</text>
  <text start="592.99" dur="5.94">is not just gonna be hey the Fed should</text>
  <text start="595.18" dur="5.97">lower rates it&amp;#39;s gonna be we need to get</text>

  <text start="637.72" dur="5.63">mention it in a tweet but it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="640.81" dur="6.66">ramp up and once he wins the election</text>
  <text start="643.35" dur="5.8">well the central bank is doomed and the</text>
