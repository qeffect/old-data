  <text start="114.5" dur="3.27">course the US government central bankers</text>
  <text start="115.939" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re trying to keep the illusion</text>
  <text start="117.77" dur="6.15">alive that everything is absolutely fine</text>
  <text start="120.049" dur="5.731">but we have seen some signs and actually</text>
  <text start="123.92" dur="3.659">when we look back in time we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="125.78" dur="3.929">look at these signs and go oh yeah now</text>
  <text start="127.579" dur="4.051">it&amp;#39;s perfectly clear I understand why</text>
  <text start="129.709" dur="3.571">the whole collapse happened I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="131.63" dur="3.93">almost like when we look back in 2008</text>
  <text start="133.28" dur="5.88">you realize what they did and what</text>
  <text start="135.56" dur="6.149">caused it and we&amp;#39;re going to see the</text>
  <text start="139.16" dur="4.38">same thing happen when this crisis hits</text>
  <text start="141.709" dur="3.78">and here are certain certain things that</text>
  <text start="143.54" dur="5.85">we are seeing right now like the junk</text>
  <text start="145.489" dur="5.881">bonds I mean back in 2013 the yield and</text>
  <text start="149.39" dur="4.379">high-yield corporate bonds the junk</text>
  <text start="151.37" dur="4.74">bonds dip below five percent for the</text>
  <text start="153.769" dur="4.291">first time in history it shouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="156.11" dur="5.16">taken a rocket scientist to figure out</text>
  <text start="158.06" dur="5.94">how absurd that was but now the trend is</text>
  <text start="161.27" dur="4.86">reversing and the junk bond market</text>
  <text start="164" dur="5.16">stalling investors and they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="166.13" dur="5.69">their shirts one hedge fund that had</text>
  <text start="169.16" dur="5.16">invested heavily in these junk bonds</text>
  <text start="171.82" dur="4.9">suspended redemptions for its effectors</text>
  <text start="174.32" dur="6.96">something only really done in times of</text>
  <text start="176.72" dur="7.05">crisis and this will be a moment when we</text>
  <text start="181.28" dur="6.12">look back and go ah yes I see this</text>
  <text start="183.77" dur="7.53">another one is the poppy loan this is</text>
  <text start="187.4" dur="7.37">the loans that were created the proud</text>
  <text start="191.3" dur="8.82">ownership purchase program loans for you</text>
  <text start="194.77" dur="7.81">they were created in San Francisco from</text>
  <text start="200.12" dur="4.26">a San Francisco Federal Credit Union</text>
  <text start="202.58" dur="5.4">that would like to help its customers</text>
  <text start="204.38" dur="6.359">buy homes that you&amp;#39;re completely</text>
  <text start="207.98" dur="5.009">unaffordable and what they&amp;#39;ve done and</text>
  <text start="210.739" dur="4.021">we&amp;#39;re seeing this not just here but in</text>
  <text start="212.989" dur="4.351">many parts of the country and especially</text>
  <text start="214.76" dur="5.1">with Freddie and Fannie and many of the</text>
  <text start="217.34" dur="6.39">small banks where what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="219.86" dur="6.21">they are allowing people allowing</text>
  <text start="223.73" dur="5.61">customers to borrow up borrow up to two</text>
  <text start="226.07" dur="7.05">million dollars with absolutely no money</text>

  <text start="237.68" dur="6.66">private mortgage insurance we see</text>
  <text start="241.58" dur="6.06">Freddie and Fannie they&amp;#39;re doing these</text>
  <text start="244.34" dur="5.01">types of loans where listen if you know</text>

  <text start="252.11" dur="5.129">include that in your calculation to see</text>
  <text start="255.44" dur="4.2">if you can afford this house they are</text>
  <text start="257.239" dur="6.091">doing whatever they possibly can to get</text>
  <text start="259.64" dur="5.82">people in to keep these bubbles inflated</text>
  <text start="263.33" dur="5.43">and we&amp;#39;re going to look back in time and</text>

  <text start="281.69" dur="4.229">okay there were no jobs out there but</text>
  <text start="283.55" dur="3.9">the US government and everyone else the</text>
  <text start="285.919" dur="4.011">corporate media were continually pushing</text>
  <text start="287.45" dur="6.18">the idea college college college college</text>
  <text start="289.93" dur="5.739">people can&amp;#39;t find jobs but they have 20</text>
  <text start="293.63" dur="3.9">30 40 50 thousand dollars worth of debt</text>
  <text start="295.669" dur="2.34">we&amp;#39;re going to say ah that was another</text>
  <text start="297.53" dur="1.58">problem</text>
  <text start="298.009" dur="4.171">we&amp;#39;re going to look back and say</text>
  <text start="299.11" dur="6.25">manufacturing millions and millions of</text>
  <text start="302.18" dur="5.879">jobs lost in manufacturing and guess</text>
  <text start="305.36" dur="4.139">what they were replaced by part-time</text>
  <text start="308.059" dur="3.48">work we&amp;#39;re going to look back in time</text>
  <text start="309.499" dur="4.25">say ah the government changed their</text>
  <text start="311.539" dur="4.74">calculation on how they did unemployment</text>
  <text start="313.749" dur="4.81">they didn&amp;#39;t count all of these people</text>
  <text start="316.279" dur="4.021">they sit down and they don&amp;#39;t want a job</text>
  <text start="318.559" dur="3.931">a hundred million people they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="320.3" dur="4.289">looking we&amp;#39;re going to look back in time</text>
  <text start="322.49" dur="4.019">and we&amp;#39;re going to say all of these</text>
  <text start="324.589" dur="3.66">things were the problem then we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="326.509" dur="3.12">to look at derivatives then we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="328.249" dur="3.84">to look at the manipulation of the stock</text>
  <text start="329.629" dur="6.78">market the suppression of gold and</text>
  <text start="332.089" dur="6.51">silver and of course by the time this</text>
  <text start="336.409" dur="5.82">all occurs it will it would have been</text>
  <text start="338.599" dur="6.6">too late we have already in the crash</text>
  <text start="342.229" dur="7.11">were beyond the crash and we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="345.199" dur="5.55">back in time like we did in 2008 we can</text>
  <text start="349.339" dur="4.14">look back now and say I yes it was</text>
  <text start="350.749" dur="5.64">subprime we see what the bankers did the</text>
  <text start="353.479" dur="5.61">bailout was fake phony and false they</text>
  <text start="356.389" dur="5.37">they cause the entire problem everything</text>
  <text start="359.089" dur="6.63">always leads back to the central bank</text>
  <text start="361.759" dur="7.2">now our world leaders met in Paris for</text>
  <text start="365.719" dur="4.861">the climate Accord trying to convince</text>
  <text start="368.959" dur="4.05">everyone that they have to steal your</text>
  <text start="370.58" dur="5.579">wealth to help protect the earth which</text>
  <text start="373.009" dur="7.2">is furthest from the truth because all</text>
  <text start="376.159" dur="5.581">these leaders got together and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="380.209" dur="5.58">saying this is the greatest threat of</text>
  <text start="381.74" dur="6.09">our generation global warming well we</text>
  <text start="385.789" dur="3.8">know the climate is always changing it</text>
  <text start="387.83" dur="4.199">always has throughout history and</text>
  <text start="389.589" dur="4.51">they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us that we</text>
  <text start="392.029" dur="3.24">are the cause of the problem but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.099" dur="4.17">very interesting as they got all</text>
  <text start="395.269" dur="6.3">together you know they spent millions a</text>
  <text start="398.269" dur="7.65">pound a hundreds of million dollars to</text>
  <text start="401.569" dur="7.65">meet they agreed on this 31-page</text>
  <text start="405.919" dur="4.98">pamphlet with no binding language or</text>
  <text start="409.219" dur="3.361">mechanism to force countries to live up</text>
  <text start="410.899" dur="4.531">to their promises to cut these</text>
  <text start="412.58" dur="6.949">greenhouse gases but what&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="415.43" dur="7.979">about this is that all of these leaders</text>
  <text start="419.529" dur="9.22">created all this waste flew over there</text>
  <text start="423.409" dur="8.371">in private planes and created millions</text>
  <text start="428.749" dur="4.681">of tons in greenhouse gases right</text>
  <text start="431.78" dur="3.81">is if you believe their official story</text>
  <text start="433.43" dur="6.27">so this is what they did it reminds me</text>
  <text start="435.59" dur="6.96">of the time when General Motors wanted a</text>
  <text start="439.7" dur="5.43">bailout because the company was going</text>
  <text start="442.55" dur="4.74">bankrupt and the CEO instead of driving</text>
  <text start="445.13" dur="4.08">over and saving the company money he</text>
  <text start="447.29" dur="4.41">took a jet plane and spent millions and</text>
  <text start="449.21" dur="5.01">millions of dollars flying to beg for</text>
  <text start="451.7" dur="5.16">money this reminds me of the same exact</text>
  <text start="454.22" dur="4.5">thing where all these leaders and</text>
  <text start="456.86" dur="4.44">bankers they&amp;#39;re flying around in their</text>
  <text start="458.72" dur="6.21">private jets trying to tell the serfs</text>
  <text start="461.3" dur="8.7">the slaves of the world to give a little</text>
  <text start="464.93" dur="8.239">bit more so we can bail them out of this</text>
  <text start="470" dur="6.6">gigantic debt problem that they caused</text>
  <text start="473.169" dur="6.611">again it always goes back to the central</text>
  <text start="476.6" dur="6.78">bank and basically what they did there</text>
  <text start="479.78" dur="5.58">is absolutely nothing out of all of this</text>
  <text start="483.38" dur="3.539">what&amp;#39;s going to happen is they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="485.36" dur="3.96">to try the tat they&amp;#39;re going to try to</text>
  <text start="486.919" dur="4.371">tax every single person person they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="489.32" dur="5.81">going to try to push a corporate tax</text>
  <text start="491.29" dur="7">they&amp;#39;re going to try to get your wealth</text>
  <text start="495.13" dur="7.24">because just like christine lagarde said</text>
  <text start="498.29" dur="7.35">this is the perfect time to place a tax</text>
  <text start="502.37" dur="5.22">on everyone for carbon to pay down the</text>
  <text start="505.64" dur="5.49">debt they&amp;#39;re also talking about a ten</text>
  <text start="507.59" dur="7.02">percent wealth text it always goes back</text>
  <text start="511.13" dur="6.33">to the same thing and if you haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="514.61" dur="5.46">seen james corbett video on global</text>
  <text start="517.46" dur="4.889">warming and climate change on how they</text>
  <text start="520.07" dur="5.13">calculate all this it is a very good</text>
  <text start="522.349" dur="5.701">video to look at just go right to his</text>
  <text start="525.2" dur="7.53">channel and it explains most of the data</text>
  <text start="528.05" dur="6.21">most of the information is located here</text>
  <text start="532.73" dur="5.4">in the United States you know six</text>
  <text start="534.26" dur="6.66">percent or so of the landmass and a lot</text>
  <text start="538.13" dur="5.67">of it is calculated right here and a lot</text>
  <text start="540.92" dur="5.61">of the sensors are not on the ocean</text>
  <text start="543.8" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re not in every part of the world</text>
  <text start="546.53" dur="5.82">and if you look at the satellite data it</text>
  <text start="549.32" dur="8.94">shows that we are cooling right now not</text>
  <text start="552.35" dur="8.25">warming now out in Libya we understand</text>
  <text start="558.26" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re going to be signing this deal</text>
  <text start="560.6" dur="5.01">where they&amp;#39;re going to have a unity</text>
  <text start="562.19" dur="5.73">government and they&amp;#39;re saying yes the</text>
  <text start="565.61" dur="4.8">rival factions they&amp;#39;ve agreed to sign a</text>
  <text start="567.92" dur="5.31">United Nations back national unity</text>
  <text start="570.41" dur="4.47">government deal but there&amp;#39;s only one</text>
  <text start="573.23" dur="4.349">problem with this and I know the</text>
  <text start="574.88" dur="4.41">corporate media the the u.s. Italy where</text>
  <text start="577.579" dur="4.561">it&amp;#39;s being held they&amp;#39;re all pushing this</text>
  <text start="579.29" dur="6.239">is a great thing but the representatives</text>
  <text start="582.14" dur="7.65">from the two rival Parliament&amp;#39;s one of</text>
  <text start="585.529" dur="6">them being salal Mac zoom of the general</text>
  <text start="589.79" dur="5.1">National Congress based in Tripoli and</text>
  <text start="591.529" dur="5.941">Mohammad Sahib from the Tobruk based</text>
  <text start="594.89" dur="4.139">House of Representatives announced in</text>
  <text start="597.47" dur="4.799">Tunis that the signing of the deal will</text>
  <text start="599.029" dur="7.261">happen on Wednesday but this is a</text>
  <text start="602.269" dur="8.01">problem because reality is is that Mac</text>
  <text start="606.29" dur="7.77">zoom is no longer the representative he</text>
  <text start="610.279" dur="7.521">was kicked out and he is the person</text>
  <text start="614.06" dur="7.26">they&amp;#39;re going to right now so right now</text>
  <text start="617.8" dur="6.34">this person does not represent the</text>
  <text start="621.32" dur="6.18">Parliament in Tripoli but they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="624.14" dur="7.199">him to sign this deal and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="627.5" dur="8.67">seeing is that the GNC is backed by</text>
  <text start="631.339" dur="8.19">Libya dawn and they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="636.17" dur="5.76">not signing this they don&amp;#39;t agree to</text>
  <text start="639.529" dur="6.651">this whatsoever and we&amp;#39;ve seen this once</text>
  <text start="641.93" dur="7.8">before and the whole deal fell apart</text>
  <text start="646.18" dur="5.62">even if this representative signs this</text>
  <text start="649.73" dur="3.99">he&amp;#39;s not a part of the Tripoli</text>
  <text start="651.8" dur="5.01">Parliament anymore he was completely</text>
  <text start="653.72" dur="4.71">thrown out so again this is another</text>
  <text start="656.81" dur="4.74">trick that the u.s. government central</text>
  <text start="658.43" dur="5.61">bankers are trying to use now if this</text>
  <text start="661.55" dur="4.32">deal completely falls apart which most</text>
  <text start="664.04" dur="3.659">likely it will and even if it&amp;#39;s signed</text>
  <text start="665.87" dur="4.589">it&amp;#39;s null and void because the</text>
  <text start="667.699" dur="4.651">Parliament in Tripoli didn&amp;#39;t sign it</text>
  <text start="670.459" dur="3.81">there&amp;#39;s going to be no matter which way</text>
  <text start="672.35" dur="3.989">you look at it there&amp;#39;s going to be war</text>
  <text start="674.269" dur="3.831">and this is why France has been flying</text>

  <text start="853.769" dur="5.28">this point there&amp;#39;s going to be many many</text>
  <text start="856.379" dur="6.18">false flags occurring across Europe and</text>
  <text start="859.049" dur="5.7">here in the United States coming up very</text>
  <text start="862.559" dur="5.58">soon either by the end of this year or</text>
  <text start="864.749" dur="6.33">coming into 2016 because they are they</text>
  <text start="868.139" dur="4.26">need to push this agenda forward they</text>
  <text start="871.079" dur="2.521">need to get the weapons away from the</text>
  <text start="872.399" dur="4.081">people they have to get the</text>
  <text start="873.6" dur="4.169">authorization for war passed in Congress</text>
  <text start="876.48" dur="3.719">they need to make sure that everyone</text>
  <text start="877.769" dur="3.99">realizes that the Islamic state is the</text>
  <text start="880.199" dur="3.42">enemy and we need to go after them and</text>
  <text start="881.759" dur="4.14">they need to make sure that we</text>
  <text start="883.619" dur="3.78">understand that China and Russia they</text>
  <text start="885.899" dur="3.24">are the biggest threat to the United</text>
  <text start="887.399" dur="4.141">States and this is why we&amp;#39;re seeing all</text>
  <text start="889.139" dur="5.401">this occur at this time another warning</text>
  <text start="891.54" dur="6">is in Lebanon and in Libya they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="894.54" dur="6.479">urging US citizens to avoid travel to</text>
  <text start="897.54" dur="4.829">these areas they advise them that people</text>
  <text start="901.019" dur="2.701">who are living and working in Lebanon</text>
  <text start="902.369" dur="3.361">that they should understand that they</text>
  <text start="903.72" dur="4.049">accept the risks of remaining in the</text>
  <text start="905.73" dur="3.81">country which means that something is</text>
  <text start="907.769" dur="5.69">going to occur in this country now we</text>
  <text start="909.54" dur="8.129">understand that in Yemen in Libya in</text>
  <text start="913.459" dur="5.71">Lebanon Iraq and Syria the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="917.669" dur="3.54">which is the proxy army for the United</text>
  <text start="919.169" dur="4.051">States government is in each one of</text>
  <text start="921.209" dur="4.47">these countries the authorization for</text>
  <text start="923.22" dur="6.079">war allows the United States to go into</text>
  <text start="925.679" dur="8.97">each one of these countries and remove</text>
  <text start="929.299" dur="7.84">the elected government or new government</text>
  <text start="934.649" dur="4.41">that was placed in there it allows them</text>
  <text start="937.139" dur="3.18">to fight the people who are trying to</text>
  <text start="939.059" dur="4.56">get rid of the puppet government out of</text>
  <text start="940.319" dur="5.161">the country and it allows them to go</text>
  <text start="943.619" dur="4.5">back in there and restore the puppet</text>
  <text start="945.48" dur="3.93">governments because what&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="948.119" dur="4.58">the Middle East is they are losing</text>
  <text start="949.41" dur="5.909">ground the people are fighting back and</text>
  <text start="952.699" dur="7.09">once the people gain control of these</text>
  <text start="955.319" dur="6.72">countries the petrodollar is basically</text>
  <text start="959.789" dur="5.071">under threat of not being used anymore</text>
  <text start="962.039" dur="4.831">we already see it occurring in Libya the</text>
  <text start="964.86" dur="4.5">Tripoli government is selling the oil</text>
  <text start="966.87" dur="4.29">not using the dollar they tried many</text>
  <text start="969.36" dur="3.24">different things by moving the central</text>
  <text start="971.16" dur="3.48">bank out of Tripoli to a different</text>
  <text start="972.6" dur="3.48">location to have the country&amp;#39;s come to</text>
  <text start="974.64" dur="3.98">them but they&amp;#39;re still going to Tripoli</text>
  <text start="976.08" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re real government of Libya and</text>
  <text start="978.62" dur="4.719">they tried to have the Islamic state</text>
  <text start="980.7" dur="5.22">come in and guard the oil refineries the</text>
  <text start="983.339" dur="4.201">ports to stop the deliveries but</text>
  <text start="985.92" dur="3.919">everything is not working at this point</text>
  <text start="987.54" dur="6.21">we see in Yemen the who these are there</text>
  <text start="989.839" dur="6.551">they are fighting to basically keep</text>
  <text start="993.75" dur="7.02">their country and keep the puppet ruler</text>
  <text start="996.39" dur="5.94">hottie out of Yemen and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1000.77" dur="3.48">seeing is this is spreading all across</text>
  <text start="1002.33" dur="5.25">the Middle East and if this continually</text>
  <text start="1004.25" dur="5.61">spreads the petro dollar is in trouble</text>
  <text start="1007.58" dur="4.08">if the petro dollar is in trouble that</text>
  <text start="1009.86" dur="4.14">means the dollar is in trouble if the</text>
  <text start="1011.66" dur="4.56">dollar is in trouble that means we have</text>
  <text start="1014" dur="4.74">a major major problem here in the United</text>
  <text start="1016.22" dur="4.53">States and this is why they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="1018.74" dur="4.83">so hard to get into Syria to build the</text>
  <text start="1020.75" dur="6.059">pipeline to put up a central bank to put</text>
  <text start="1023.57" dur="5.67">all their natural resources oil on the</text>
  <text start="1026.809" dur="4.201">dollar then eventually go into Iran this</text>
  <text start="1029.24" dur="5.4">has been their plan from the beginning</text>
  <text start="1031.01" dur="6.12">it is all falling apart and the only</text>
  <text start="1034.64" dur="5.28">thing they have left right now is to</text>
  <text start="1037.13" dur="5.52">start war because they need all eyes off</text>
  <text start="1039.92" dur="5.039">of the central banking system and they</text>
  <text start="1042.65" dur="4.59">need that to be placed on another group</text>
  <text start="1044.959" dur="7.711">or country to be blamed they need the</text>
  <text start="1047.24" dur="8.28">war to completely wipe out our current</text>
  <text start="1052.67" dur="5.73">system and they want to bring in a new</text>
  <text start="1055.52" dur="4.74">system after the war now of course the</text>
  <text start="1058.4" dur="7.14">war might most likely will go nuclear</text>
  <text start="1060.26" dur="7.53">and these insane people believe that</text>
  <text start="1065.54" dur="4.5">after the war they&amp;#39;re going to emerge</text>
  <text start="1067.79" dur="6.78">from their bunkers and restart the</text>
