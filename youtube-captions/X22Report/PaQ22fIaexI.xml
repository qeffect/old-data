  <text start="216.19" dur="5.74">we can see throughout the world right</text>

  <text start="221.93" dur="6.36">the UK well retail sales growth slowed</text>
  <text start="225.05" dur="6.3">in November now it&amp;#39;s funny they like to</text>
  <text start="228.29" dur="4.71">put spins on the articles and they try</text>
  <text start="231.35" dur="5.16">to make it seem like it&amp;#39;s doing better</text>
  <text start="233" dur="6.12">than it really is and we can see the</text>
  <text start="236.51" dur="5.31">British Retail Consortium said from</text>
  <text start="239.12" dur="5.49">October thirtieth to November 26 sales</text>
  <text start="241.82" dur="5.46">rose by one-point-three percent where</text>
  <text start="244.61" dur="6.87">they&amp;#39;re saying this isn&amp;#39;t bad but if you</text>
  <text start="247.28" dur="6.12">go back to the previous month well sales</text>
  <text start="251.48" dur="4.44">were at one point seven percent if you</text>
  <text start="253.4" dur="5.119">go a month back from that it was at 2.4%</text>
  <text start="255.92" dur="5.129">and just think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="258.519" dur="4.361">we&amp;#39;re going into the holiday season</text>
  <text start="261.049" dur="4.141">these numbers should be going the other</text>
  <text start="262.88" dur="3.92">way around it should be one-point-three</text>
  <text start="265.19" dur="4.8">percent one-point-seven percent</text>
  <text start="266.8" dur="5.98">two-point-four percent but that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="269.99" dur="5.4">what&amp;#39;s happening here in the United</text>
  <text start="272.78" dur="5.28">States well we see the same thing</text>
  <text start="275.39" dur="4.98">happening they tell us yes people are</text>
  <text start="278.06" dur="5.04">spending this much money billions of</text>
  <text start="280.37" dur="5.04">dollars and it sounds like wow shopping</text>
  <text start="283.1" dur="4.23">is off to a great start but then you</text>
  <text start="285.41" dur="4.65">start looking at the numbers then you</text>
  <text start="287.33" dur="4.589">start realizing we&amp;#39;ll wait a minute it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="290.06" dur="4.56">a lot less than last year it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="291.919" dur="4.411">less than the year before that is it</text>
  <text start="294.62" dur="5.43">really that great know the holiday</text>
  <text start="296.33" dur="9.26">season is a disaster I actually out in</text>
  <text start="300.05" dur="9.96">the UK we see that there are about 250</text>
  <text start="305.59" dur="9.4">thousand homeless in England this is</text>
  <text start="310.01" dur="6.84">coming from UK charity they&amp;#39;re warning</text>
  <text start="314.99" dur="5.16">that it is getting worse and worse as</text>
  <text start="316.85" dur="6.78">time goes on and they&amp;#39;re saying these</text>
  <text start="320.15" dur="6.8">estimates are low there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="323.63" dur="6.27">people that are not even counted and</text>
  <text start="326.95" dur="5.71">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the</text>
  <text start="329.9" dur="5.31">system that we are in it is starting to</text>
  <text start="332.66" dur="5.37">break down we see that core durable</text>
  <text start="335.21" dur="5.01">goods here in the United States well for</text>
  <text start="338.03" dur="5.57">the twenty second straight month in a</text>
  <text start="340.22" dur="6.96">row guess what they declined on a</text>
  <text start="343.6" dur="5.65">year-over-year basis in October this is</text>
  <text start="347.18" dur="6.78">the longest non recessionary streak in</text>
  <text start="349.25" dur="6.03">US history bar none and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="353.96" dur="5.19">amazing because when you look back in</text>
  <text start="355.28" dur="6.93">time you can see every time that we were</text>
  <text start="359.15" dur="7.77">in this predicament of core durable</text>
  <text start="362.21" dur="7.74">goods in negative territory we were</text>
  <text start="366.92" dur="4.47">already in a recession and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="369.95" dur="2.88">looking at many of these indicators and</text>
  <text start="371.39" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re all pointing to a recession</text>
  <text start="372.83" dur="3.6">actually we&amp;#39;re going into a depression</text>
  <text start="374.39" dur="5.25">right now and people are going to be</text>
  <text start="376.43" dur="4.41">completely shocked when this happens but</text>
  <text start="379.64" dur="3">of course the corporate media is out</text>
  <text start="380.84" dur="3.84">there and they&amp;#39;re making a really big</text>
  <text start="382.64" dur="4.73">deal about factory orders in America how</text>
  <text start="384.68" dur="6.12">they&amp;#39;re surging by the most in 16 months</text>
  <text start="387.37" dur="7.99">well why are they surging well these</text>
  <text start="390.8" dur="10.38">numbers are before the election they</text>
  <text start="395.36" dur="10.71">were being used to boost the idea that</text>
  <text start="401.18" dur="7.71">the economy is doing well and where did</text>
  <text start="406.07" dur="6.75">this all come from well there was a</text>
  <text start="408.89" dur="7.52">surge in government spending the</text>
  <text start="412.82" dur="9.06">government bought a lot of things which</text>
  <text start="416.41" dur="9.16">made factory orders surged and we know</text>
  <text start="421.88" dur="7.74">this was all done to make everyone</text>
  <text start="425.57" dur="6.48">believe that the economy is completely</text>
  <text start="429.62" dur="5.25">recovered and of course now what do we</text>
  <text start="432.05" dur="6.27">have we have unemployment at four point</text>
  <text start="434.87" dur="5.52">six percent manipulated gdp at</text>
  <text start="438.32" dur="3.78">three-point-two percent exported</text>
  <text start="440.39" dur="4.05">soybeans to make it two point nine</text>
  <text start="442.1" dur="3.63">percent then revised the numbers to</text>
  <text start="444.44" dur="3.78">bring it up over three-point-two percent</text>
  <text start="445.73" dur="3.09">because obama never had a quarter</text>
  <text start="448.22" dur="2.94">through</text>
  <text start="448.82" dur="3.87">his presidency with gdp over three</text>
  <text start="451.16" dur="4.08">percent so he needed that before he</text>
  <text start="452.69" dur="5.91">leaves office we have factory orders</text>
  <text start="455.24" dur="7.38">surging right now stock market at the</text>
  <text start="458.6" dur="5.88">highest it&amp;#39;s been this again is a</text>
  <text start="462.62" dur="3.63">complete set up but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="464.48" dur="4.92">interesting about all this is that US</text>
  <text start="466.25" dur="4.56">productivity well it only rose by</text>
  <text start="469.4" dur="3.51">three-point-one percent in the third</text>
  <text start="470.81" dur="4.38">quarter missing expectations of a three</text>
  <text start="472.91" dur="4.95">point three percent rise but on a</text>
  <text start="475.19" dur="6.18">year-over-year basis the third quarter</text>
  <text start="477.86" dur="5.19">saw a second consecutive decline the</text>
  <text start="481.37" dur="6">first two quarter decline in u.s.</text>
  <text start="483.05" dur="7.44">productivity since 1993 now the Atlanta</text>
  <text start="487.37" dur="4.92">Fed is out there and they use estimates</text>
  <text start="490.49" dur="2.85">to figure out what the GDP is going to</text>
  <text start="492.29" dur="3.12">be and they&amp;#39;re working on the fourth</text>
  <text start="493.34" dur="2.94">quarter right now and in the beginning</text>
  <text start="495.41" dur="2.64">they said it was going to be around</text>
  <text start="496.28" dur="3.75">two-point-nine percent very close to</text>
  <text start="498.05" dur="4.53">three percent now they cut it all ready</text>
  <text start="500.03" dur="4.14">to two point six percent and again what</text>
  <text start="502.58" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re most likely going to do is</text>
  <text start="504.17" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re going to try to keep the GDP up</text>
  <text start="506.66" dur="5.37">as high as they possibly can using</text>
  <text start="509.39" dur="5.339">revisions manipulation because we know</text>
  <text start="512.03" dur="5.91">Obama well he&amp;#39;s still in the white house</text>
  <text start="514.729" dur="6.031">until January and they want this economy</text>
  <text start="517.94" dur="6.9">looking really really good before he</text>
  <text start="520.76" dur="8.34">leaves before he hands the gift of the</text>
  <text start="524.84" dur="8.1">economy off to trump now as we know the</text>
  <text start="529.1" dur="5.79">Fed discontinued QE well this is what</text>
  <text start="532.94" dur="5.61">they tell the public but we know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="534.89" dur="5.64">doing it covertly and there was a very</text>
  <text start="538.55" dur="5.19">odd growth spurt in the true money</text>
  <text start="540.53" dur="5.21">supply the growth rates of various</text>
  <text start="543.74" dur="6.78">Austrian measures of the US money supply</text>
  <text start="545.74" dur="6.46">such as TMS to and money AMS well they</text>
  <text start="550.52" dur="5.97">have accelerated significantly in recent</text>
  <text start="552.2" dur="8.19">months and this is surprising as the Fed</text>
  <text start="556.49" dur="6.66">hasn&amp;#39;t been engaged in QE for quite some</text>
  <text start="560.39" dur="4.89">time which we know they&amp;#39;re really doing</text>
  <text start="563.15" dur="6.12">and when you look at this you see that</text>
  <text start="565.28" dur="6.78">as the stock market the SM the SMP 500</text>
  <text start="569.27" dur="7.32">index continually moves up and up and up</text>
  <text start="572.06" dur="8.74">there&amp;#39;s a strong correlation with the</text>
  <text start="576.59" dur="7.309">monetary base and we can see as</text>
  <text start="580.8" dur="5.469">the money supply increases it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="583.899" dur="5.31">strange how the stock market continually</text>
  <text start="586.269" dur="5.611">goes up when the money supply decreases</text>
  <text start="589.209" dur="7.011">it&amp;#39;s very strange and healthy stock</text>
  <text start="591.88" dur="9.149">market goes down and we can see this is</text>
  <text start="596.22" dur="10.75">manipulation and it&amp;#39;s very closely</text>
  <text start="601.029" dur="8.851">correlated and we know that they are</text>
  <text start="606.97" dur="6.299">controlling this entire system through</text>
  <text start="609.88" dur="8.759">manipulation and when the manipulation</text>
  <text start="613.269" dur="8.43">ends well so does the economy now very</text>
  <text start="618.639" dur="7.411">interestingly the sharia gold standard</text>
  <text start="621.699" dur="7.711">was approved for a 2 trillion islamic</text>

  <text start="802.64" dur="3.96">the case in India where the government</text>
  <text start="804.38" dur="5.76">recently been all currency denominations</text>
  <text start="806.6" dur="5.549">over 500 rupees and the argument from</text>
  <text start="810.14" dur="3.84">the government was that they&amp;#39;re doing</text>

  <text start="838.94" dur="7.139">about seven bucks and we can see right</text>
