  <text start="53.03" dur="5.04">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="56.57" dur="5.489">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="58.07" dur="6.839">episode 1577 bee and today&amp;#39;s date is May</text>
  <text start="62.059" dur="6.121">25th 2018 and the title of the episode</text>
  <text start="64.909" dur="6.691">is the trap was set the trap has been</text>
  <text start="68.18" dur="5.6">sprung let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="71.6" dur="5.48">collapse political and geopolitical news</text>
  <text start="73.78" dur="6.22">now as we can see the corporate media</text>
  <text start="77.08" dur="5.319">those in the Intelligence Agency the FBI</text>
  <text start="80" dur="5.36">and the rest they have been trying to</text>
  <text start="82.399" dur="5.371">play down this whole spy gate thing and</text>
  <text start="85.36" dur="4.539">they&amp;#39;re trying to say that you know this</text>
  <text start="87.77" dur="5.459">is normal practice this is what we do</text>
  <text start="89.899" dur="8.36">but the main question is why did they</text>
  <text start="93.229" dur="8.34">have an informant spying on the campaign</text>
  <text start="98.259" dur="4.301">before anyone even knew about the</text>
  <text start="101.569" dur="3.09">Russian hoax</text>
  <text start="102.56" dur="4.68">I mean think about that for a second I</text>
  <text start="104.659" dur="5.88">mean this is completely against the law</text>
  <text start="107.24" dur="6.96">and there was no Russian hoax there was</text>
  <text start="110.539" dur="7.08">nothing it was just a candidate looking</text>
  <text start="114.2" dur="4.62">to become president just like all the</text>
  <text start="117.619" dur="3.331">other candidates so did they have an</text>
  <text start="118.82" dur="6.06">informant in every single one of the</text>
  <text start="120.95" dur="5.75">campaign&amp;#39;s even in Clinton&amp;#39;s campaign I</text>
  <text start="124.88" dur="4.379">doubt it</text>
  <text start="126.7" dur="4.3">basically what this tells us is that</text>
  <text start="129.259" dur="3.721">they were spy and of course it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="131" dur="4.11">illegal you just can&amp;#39;t spy on it an</text>
  <text start="132.98" dur="3.24">everyday citizen for no reason</text>
  <text start="135.11" dur="4.23">whatsoever just because they&amp;#39;re running</text>
  <text start="136.22" dur="4.47">to become president and this is what</text>
  <text start="139.34" dur="2.519">this is all about but they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="140.69" dur="2.549">play it down they&amp;#39;re trying to make it</text>
  <text start="141.859" dur="3.75">seem like it&amp;#39;s not that big of a deal</text>
  <text start="143.239" dur="4.261">that this is just normal practice and</text>
  <text start="145.609" dur="6.931">why is everyone getting all crazy about</text>
  <text start="147.5" dur="7.109">it well yeah when you plant someone to</text>
  <text start="152.54" dur="7.5">find out information to pass information</text>
  <text start="154.609" dur="11.311">to other parties and to try to pin some</text>
  <text start="160.04" dur="9.509">type of hoax on someone and make it seem</text>
  <text start="165.92" dur="6.3">like it&amp;#39;s real well that&amp;#39;s against the</text>
  <text start="169.549" dur="4.981">law and again these people believe</text>
  <text start="172.22" dur="5.579">they&amp;#39;re above the law and this is the</text>
  <text start="174.53" dur="4.95">main problem we see that some US</text>
  <text start="177.799" dur="5.22">websites they&amp;#39;ve gone dark</text>
  <text start="179.48" dur="5.039">across Europe and this suspension is due</text>
  <text start="183.019" dur="3.251">to the new privacy rules requiring</text>
  <text start="184.519" dur="3.581">transparency</text>
  <text start="186.27" dur="3.96">the websites for the Los Angeles Times</text>
  <text start="188.1" dur="4.65">New York Daily News and others in the</text>
  <text start="190.23" dur="4.92">u.s. went dark across Europe on Friday</text>
  <text start="192.75" dur="4.05">as a new set of data privacy rules were</text>
  <text start="195.15" dur="3.83">imposed the European Union&amp;#39;s general</text>
  <text start="196.8" dur="4.65">data protection regulation kicked in</text>
  <text start="198.98" dur="4.75">prompting Trunk Inc the publisher of</text>
  <text start="201.45" dur="5.4">those sites to block readers from the EU</text>
  <text start="203.73" dur="7.34">as the websites made changes to comply</text>
  <text start="206.85" dur="7.11">now Google Twitter Yelp uber they have</text>
  <text start="211.07" dur="4.81">already sent notices to their users and</text>
  <text start="213.96" dur="4.32">I&amp;#39;m sure everyone has been getting them</text>
  <text start="215.88" dur="4.29">seeing them and they&amp;#39;ve been telling</text>
  <text start="218.28" dur="4.71">everyone that these changes are in</text>
  <text start="220.17" dur="4.86">effect right now the new rules require</text>
  <text start="222.99" dur="5.31">companies to give full disclosure to</text>
  <text start="225.03" dur="5.67">site users on what they do with digital</text>
  <text start="228.3" dur="4.53">information they collect and offer them</text>
  <text start="230.7" dur="3.99">more control under the new rules</text>
  <text start="232.83" dur="4.8">European users are able to request</text>
  <text start="234.69" dur="5.07">copies of the data that websites have on</text>
  <text start="237.63" dur="5.01">them or ask companies to delete that</text>
  <text start="239.76" dur="5.48">information now the question is are they</text>
  <text start="242.64" dur="5.67">really going to delete that information</text>
  <text start="245.24" dur="6.22">because things on the internet are just</text>
  <text start="248.31" dur="5.28">not easily deleted web sites have to ask</text>
  <text start="251.46" dur="5.01">for permission to collect and share user</text>
  <text start="253.59" dur="4.56">data and companies need to disclose</text>
  <text start="256.47" dur="3.48">their data practices in clear language</text>
  <text start="258.15" dur="3.959">instead of obscuring them with legalese</text>
  <text start="259.95" dur="3.96">which they always do and you can see all</text>
  <text start="262.109" dur="4.081">those terms of services you can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="263.91" dur="6.6">make heads a tail of it now in the u.s.</text>
  <text start="266.19" dur="6.78">we don&amp;#39;t have these rules maybe now the</text>
  <text start="270.51" dur="4.8">US will start adopting them because we</text>
  <text start="272.97" dur="4.89">can see that with Facebook with Google</text>
  <text start="275.31" dur="4.5">with what YouTube is doing and with all</text>
  <text start="277.86" dur="4.47">the censoring and everything else you</text>
  <text start="279.81" dur="4.71">know the heat is on them right now and</text>
  <text start="282.33" dur="6.57">maybe this and hopefully this will</text>
  <text start="284.52" dur="7.74">trickle down and make them change what</text>
  <text start="288.9" dur="4.62">they do and stop everything that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="292.26" dur="4.11">been doing this is the whole point of it</text>
  <text start="293.52" dur="5.25">and this is why q and many others has</text>
  <text start="296.37" dur="5.25">said that we need an internet Bill of</text>
  <text start="298.77" dur="5.94">Rights allowing everyone to have the</text>
  <text start="301.62" dur="8.55">freedom to speak freely on these public</text>
  <text start="304.71" dur="7.56">social media platforms and I do believe</text>
  <text start="310.17" dur="3.78">this I believe everyone has the right to</text>
  <text start="312.27" dur="6.149">go on there and say whatever they want</text>
  <text start="313.95" dur="5.939">to say I mean this is the Constitution</text>
  <text start="318.419" dur="4.47">this is the Bill of Rights</text>
  <text start="319.889" dur="5.34">the freedom to speak your mind and just</text>
  <text start="322.889" dur="3.93">because another group doesn&amp;#39;t like it it</text>
  <text start="325.229" dur="4.53">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you can take them down</text>
  <text start="326.819" dur="4.861">just because they&amp;#39;re talking about a</text>
  <text start="329.759" dur="4.041">different candidate or they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="331.68" dur="6.209">about things that they don&amp;#39;t agree with</text>
  <text start="333.8" dur="8.049">but once again we can see this is their</text>
  <text start="337.889" dur="5.671">way of censoring people and if you look</text>
  <text start="341.849" dur="4.41">back in time they did this in other ways</text>
  <text start="343.56" dur="4.59">people that wrote books where these</text>
  <text start="346.259" dur="3.09">individuals didn&amp;#39;t want people to read</text>
  <text start="348.15" dur="4.229">certain books what they do with them</text>
  <text start="349.349" dur="5.641">they burn them and they took them out of</text>
  <text start="352.379" dur="5.79">circulation they made the decision for</text>
  <text start="354.99" dur="4.889">everyone the people they&amp;#39;re pretty smart</text>
  <text start="358.169" dur="3.06">they can make the decision if they want</text>
  <text start="359.879" dur="2.671">to read something or not read something</text>
  <text start="361.229" dur="3.78">believe something if they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="362.55" dur="4.26">believe something and the people will</text>
  <text start="365.009" dur="4.68">decide you know how the people decide</text>
  <text start="366.81" dur="4.919">just like they decide what shows to</text>
  <text start="369.689" dur="3.48">watch if they don&amp;#39;t like a certain show</text>
  <text start="371.729" dur="3.96">guess what happens it goes off the air</text>
  <text start="373.169" dur="5.25">they don&amp;#39;t like a certain radio program</text>
  <text start="375.689" dur="4.59">it goes off the air if someone doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="378.419" dur="3.78">like what they&amp;#39;re hearing on YouTube or</text>
  <text start="380.279" dur="5.781">anything like that they get very little</text>
  <text start="382.199" dur="7.58">views unless it&amp;#39;s manipulated of course</text>
  <text start="386.06" dur="6.849">so we can see with North Korea right now</text>
  <text start="389.779" dur="4.931">Trump laid out this whole entire plan</text>
  <text start="392.909" dur="3.301">and not it&amp;#39;s not just trumpets the</text>
  <text start="394.71" dur="4.47">Patriots behind this and he sent the</text>
  <text start="396.21" dur="5.16">letter to Kim jong-un and he said he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="399.18" dur="3.72">cancelling the summit now Kim Jong moon</text>
  <text start="401.37" dur="3.659">says no no I don&amp;#39;t want you to cancel</text>
  <text start="402.9" dur="4.889">the summit the summit should still</text>
  <text start="405.029" dur="5.371">proceed and now they&amp;#39;re saying on June</text>
  <text start="407.789" dur="4.68">12th maybe the summit will proceed so it</text>
  <text start="410.4" dur="3.449">looks like this was the trap because all</text>
  <text start="412.469" dur="4.831">along the corporate media was telling us</text>
  <text start="413.849" dur="6.57">that Kim jong-un was figuring out a way</text>
  <text start="417.3" dur="5.339">to cancel this and now it doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="420.419" dur="4.821">any sense because he&amp;#39;s saying he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="422.639" dur="6.06">want this to be canceled he wants this</text>
  <text start="425.24" dur="6.669">to continue and move forward and I do</text>
  <text start="428.699" dur="5.761">believe that the real summit the real</text>
  <text start="431.909" dur="5.79">peace talks that already taken place</text>
  <text start="434.46" dur="5.579">this is for show this is for the rest of</text>
  <text start="437.699" dur="4.89">the world and this is why North Korea</text>
  <text start="440.039" dur="5.75">went along and released the hostages</text>
  <text start="442.589" dur="5.88">with no problems went ahead and</text>
  <text start="445.789" dur="5.651">denuclearized with no problems because</text>
  <text start="448.469" dur="4.781">this was part of their deal and I</text>
  <text start="451.44" dur="4.78">believe right now</text>
  <text start="453.25" dur="4.83">Trump was trapping the corporate media</text>
  <text start="456.22" dur="5.16">trapping the intelligences that were</text>
  <text start="458.08" dur="6.62">trying to push their agenda because they</text>
  <text start="461.38" dur="6.75">don&amp;#39;t want peace in North Korea and</text>
  <text start="464.7" dur="6.13">right now the White House the team they</text>
  <text start="468.13" dur="6">haven&amp;#39;t cancelled the travel plans to</text>
  <text start="470.83" dur="6.93">Singapore they&amp;#39;re still moving forward</text>
  <text start="474.13" dur="5.06">with this as of today now maybe they</text>
  <text start="477.76" dur="4.11">will cancel it but at this point</text>
  <text start="479.19" dur="5.1">everything is still being prepared right</text>
  <text start="481.87" dur="5.94">now they have not received any</text>
  <text start="484.29" dur="6.82">cancellation orders whatsoever now</text>
  <text start="487.81" dur="4.62">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is Anton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="491.11" dur="3.9">have been researching this and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="492.43" dur="5.66">going back to Q now and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="495.01" dur="5.79">saying is that Trump put up two messages</text>
  <text start="498.09" dur="7.99">where he put up his letter to Kim</text>
  <text start="500.8" dur="8.58">jong-un and he spelt jung-jae ung and</text>
  <text start="506.08" dur="5.94">then changed it to Jay Ong so it was a</text>
  <text start="509.38" dur="5.849">spelling mistake and what someone</text>
  <text start="512.02" dur="6.24">someone pointed out was well this was</text>
  <text start="515.229" dur="6.321">actually brilliant because Trump</text>
  <text start="518.26" dur="9.39">actually let out some information</text>
  <text start="521.55" dur="8.98">because in Korean Jay ung in Korean</text>
  <text start="527.65" dur="9.42">means a friend that you deeply care</text>
  <text start="530.53" dur="9.57">about jang jae ong in Korean means slave</text>
  <text start="537.07" dur="5.46">so first he had the Ju ng which means</text>
  <text start="540.1" dur="5.25">you are a friend and then changed it to</text>
  <text start="542.53" dur="7.52">his other spelling the spelling of his</text>
  <text start="545.35" dur="10.01">name Jay Ong so that was a message that</text>
  <text start="550.05" dur="10.69">yes we are friends now if we go back to</text>
  <text start="555.36" dur="7.42">Q&amp;#39;s posts like 1383 where and other</text>
  <text start="560.74" dur="4.08">posts where he said follow the pen and</text>
  <text start="562.78" dur="5.1">he gave different pictures of the pen</text>
  <text start="564.82" dur="6.9">one of the Annan&amp;#39;s mapped all of this</text>
  <text start="567.88" dur="6.18">out and took the pictures of the letter</text>
  <text start="571.72" dur="5.58">took the pictures of where the pen was</text>
  <text start="574.06" dur="7.08">the photos that Q releases and put it</text>
  <text start="577.3" dur="7.32">all together and basically shows how all</text>
  <text start="581.14" dur="6.36">these are connected and the letter which</text>
  <text start="584.62" dur="6.12">is shown in the picture that Q dropped</text>
  <text start="587.5" dur="6.09">was already written in the past so this</text>
  <text start="590.74" dur="5.43">was planned from the beginning this was</text>
  <text start="593.59" dur="5.64">a trap to trap the corporate media to</text>
  <text start="596.17" dur="6.39">trap the intelligence agencies to trap</text>
  <text start="599.23" dur="6.21">the deep state into continually pushing</text>
  <text start="602.56" dur="4.92">their agenda and then turn it around to</text>
  <text start="605.44" dur="5.43">say where did you get this story</text>
  <text start="607.48" dur="5.31">he never said these things so what are</text>
  <text start="610.87" dur="5.28">you printing what are you putting out</text>
  <text start="612.79" dur="5.52">there these are lies these are fake news</text>
  <text start="616.15" dur="5.79">and I think we are going down this path</text>
  <text start="618.31" dur="5.34">because you can see that right now Kim</text>
  <text start="621.94" dur="3.42">Jong moon is saying no we we need to</text>
  <text start="623.65" dur="4.2">have the summit and they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="625.36" dur="5.82">preparing for June 12th which is very</text>
  <text start="627.85" dur="7.29">interesting and if you go back to post</text>
  <text start="631.18" dur="6.45">1381 this was on May 16th where cue said</text>
  <text start="635.14" dur="4.4">follow the pen already written the</text>
  <text start="637.63" dur="6.06">letter on May 16th was already written</text>
  <text start="639.54" dur="6.79">letters left visible to match and if you</text>
  <text start="643.69" dur="6.63">look at this you can see from the</text>
  <text start="646.33" dur="5.58">pictures where the pen was it says you</text>
  <text start="650.32" dur="5.76">can read it like white and then you see</text>
  <text start="651.91" dur="6.54">house and it matches the letter that he</text>
  <text start="656.08" dur="3.9">was he had written to Kim jong-un if you</text>
  <text start="658.45" dur="3.93">look at the other letters where the pen</text>
  <text start="659.98" dur="4.65">are where you see the T in the a and all</text>
  <text start="662.38" dur="4.709">the other things they match up and you</text>
  <text start="664.63" dur="6.48">can see right now Q was telling you that</text>
  <text start="667.089" dur="7.381">this was already done and again if we go</text>
  <text start="671.11" dur="9.36">back to future proves past the future</text>
  <text start="674.47" dur="9.93">just proved the past and it&amp;#39;s 100% Q</text>
  <text start="680.47" dur="6.89">proof so we can see right now that the</text>
  <text start="684.4" dur="6.27">trap was set the trap was sprung and</text>
  <text start="687.36" dur="7.99">basically it&amp;#39;s backing the deep state</text>
  <text start="690.67" dur="9.14">into a corner we see that Iran is giving</text>
  <text start="695.35" dur="9.18">Europe until next Friday to abide by</text>
  <text start="699.81" dur="7.66">their deal and if they don&amp;#39;t there is no</text>
  <text start="704.53" dur="5.67">plan B so what does that mean</text>
  <text start="707.47" dur="6.27">well if we go back to Q and what Q has</text>
  <text start="710.2" dur="6.45">been saying well the money has kept Iran</text>
  <text start="713.74" dur="7.32">silent it&amp;#39;s kept many individuals silent</text>
  <text start="716.65" dur="4.77">if the money dries up will Iran start to</text>
  <text start="721.06" dur="2.43">talk</text>
  <text start="721.42" dur="5.34">will they start to deal because remember</text>
  <text start="723.49" dur="7.11">the Iranian deal the cargo plane full of</text>
  <text start="726.76" dur="6.84">cash was slush fund money and they had</text>
  <text start="730.6" dur="6.45">certain deals worked out with Iran where</text>
  <text start="733.6" dur="8.01">they were using uranium being brought</text>
  <text start="737.05" dur="6.75">into Syria they were using these these</text>
  <text start="741.61" dur="5.64">funds coming out of the Iranian deal to</text>
  <text start="743.8" dur="6.6">fund certain operations and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="747.25" dur="5.52">interesting about all of this is Europe</text>
  <text start="750.4" dur="3.84">kept on saying that you know we need the</text>
  <text start="752.77" dur="6.15">deal we need the deal we need the deal</text>
  <text start="754.24" dur="6.99">and we need to keep it together and they</text>
  <text start="758.92" dur="7.02">had to come up with money to pay Iran</text>
  <text start="761.23" dur="6.63">they had to keep the deal going and Iran</text>
  <text start="765.94" dur="3.21">was out there saying yes the political</text>
  <text start="767.86" dur="3.3">support is great but we need the</text>
  <text start="769.15" dur="4.08">financial support and this is where it</text>
  <text start="771.16" dur="3.87">kind of broke down now maybe Europe will</text>
  <text start="773.23" dur="4.4">come up with the funds they need and</text>
  <text start="775.03" dur="5.85">keep funding Iran to keep them silent</text>
  <text start="777.63" dur="6.16">but when it came to the money part of it</text>
  <text start="780.88" dur="7.65">it seems like they couldn&amp;#39;t stick it or</text>
  <text start="783.79" dur="8.91">stay together and fund this plan without</text>
  <text start="788.53" dur="6.06">the slush money from the US and this is</text>
  <text start="792.7" dur="4.8">what&amp;#39;s very interesting because McCrone</text>
  <text start="794.59" dur="5.94">we had merkel visit the White House</text>
  <text start="797.5" dur="4.86">saying you can&amp;#39;t you know get you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="800.53" dur="3.45">get out of the deal you have to stay in</text>
  <text start="802.36" dur="5.1">the deal it&amp;#39;s going to ruin everything</text>
  <text start="803.98" dur="6">and if they&amp;#39;re so concerned why don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="807.46" dur="4.89">they just pay off Iran what is the</text>
  <text start="809.98" dur="4.92">problem here now maybe they will come to</text>
  <text start="812.35" dur="5.16">a consensus and they will do it and they</text>
  <text start="814.9" dur="4.47">will pay up but do you really think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="817.51" dur="3.54">gonna last that long what do you think</text>

  <text start="821.05" dur="3.77">to wait and see but I find it very</text>
  <text start="823.18" dur="4.65">interesting that it&amp;#39;s taking this long</text>
  <text start="824.82" dur="6.04">for them to make a decision on what</text>
  <text start="827.83" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re going to do and we&amp;#39;ll see what</text>
