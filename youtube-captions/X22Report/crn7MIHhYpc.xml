  <text start="116.88" dur="5.79">suppressed everything is manipulated</text>
  <text start="119.369" dur="4.23">here and then all of a sudden Trump</text>
  <text start="122.67" dur="4.14">comes into the picture</text>
  <text start="123.599" dur="5.461">and the economy is doing better than</text>
  <text start="126.81" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s ever done before this is on purpose</text>
  <text start="129.06" dur="5.64">this is part of the plan because what is</text>
  <text start="132.48" dur="6.3">happening here is Trump is making it</text>
  <text start="134.7" dur="6.72">look like everything is fantastic now if</text>
  <text start="138.78" dur="5.19">there is news if the Fed does raise the</text>
  <text start="141.42" dur="6.209">rates which they are doing and it brings</text>
  <text start="143.97" dur="5.37">down the economy is he to blame yes he</text>
  <text start="147.629" dur="5.61">took on the responsibility of the stock</text>
  <text start="149.34" dur="7.649">market but if there is news that comes</text>
  <text start="153.239" dur="6.241">out and the economy implodes on itself</text>
  <text start="156.989" dur="8.631">or the stock market comes down was that</text>
  <text start="159.48" dur="10.729">his fault no if the Fed raises rates and</text>
  <text start="165.62" dur="7.589">destroys the economy is it his fault no</text>
  <text start="170.209" dur="6.041">this has been the plan all along</text>
  <text start="173.209" dur="4.481">to make it look like using the</text>
  <text start="176.25" dur="2.849">manipulation that the deep state has</text>
  <text start="177.69" dur="5.579">been using the central banks have been</text>
  <text start="179.099" dur="7.591">using using that manipulation to work</text>
  <text start="183.269" dur="8.011">against them we know the economy&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="186.69" dur="8.31">we can&amp;#39;t repair this economy we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="191.28" dur="5.13">reboot it we can&amp;#39;t make it better the</text>
  <text start="195" dur="4.17">deep state the central banks they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="196.41" dur="3.33">moved our manufacturing out of this</text>
  <text start="199.17" dur="5.34">country</text>
  <text start="199.74" dur="8.04">they set up terrible trade deals are the</text>
  <text start="204.51" dur="6.84">the central bank the Fed has devalued</text>
  <text start="207.78" dur="7.14">the dollar since their inception we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="211.35" dur="5.46">come off the gold standard and the</text>
  <text start="214.92" dur="7.41">education system has gone down the drain</text>
  <text start="216.81" dur="7.88">and this has an effect over time and we</text>
  <text start="222.33" dur="6.99">can see right now the United States is</text>
  <text start="224.69" dur="9.4">just a shell yes we have an army a navy</text>
  <text start="229.32" dur="6.81">we have the Marines we have equipment do</text>
  <text start="234.09" dur="3.33">we have gold we don&amp;#39;t know we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="236.13" dur="5.88">what the central bankers have done with</text>
  <text start="237.42" dur="7.23">it and we have a Federal Reserve which</text>
  <text start="242.01" dur="5">is calling the shots in this country and</text>
  <text start="244.65" dur="6.42">destroying the countries the country</text>
  <text start="247.01" dur="6.4">from their money printing so the only</text>
  <text start="251.07" dur="3.96">way to get out of this is to bring the</text>
  <text start="253.41" dur="4.92">system down now this can be done in many</text>
  <text start="255.03" dur="7.47">different ways one blame it on the Fed</text>
  <text start="258.33" dur="5.85">to have news come out and say wow the</text>
  <text start="262.5" dur="4.11">economy was doing well and all of a</text>
  <text start="264.18" dur="4.92">sudden we have this news that certain</text>
  <text start="266.61" dur="4.559">individuals they were traitors to the</text>
  <text start="269.1" dur="5.01">country people going to react to this</text>
  <text start="271.169" dur="5.431">the markets gonna fall and we can see</text>
  <text start="274.11" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;re heading in this direction if we</text>
  <text start="276.6" dur="4.29">start to look at these numbers like</text>
  <text start="278.28" dur="4.02">jobless claims and all this stuff we see</text>
  <text start="280.89" dur="4.23">they don&amp;#39;t even make sense anymore</text>
  <text start="282.3" dur="7.29">I mean right now jobless claims they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="285.12" dur="8.1">down to 49 year lows now why is this</text>
  <text start="289.59" dur="7.77">let&amp;#39;s compare this to the 90s GDP in the</text>
  <text start="293.22" dur="7.41">90s was much stronger than today initial</text>
  <text start="297.36" dur="7.26">jobless claims had 9 years of recovery</text>
  <text start="300.63" dur="7.32">and we see that in the 90s</text>
  <text start="304.62" dur="7.95">going into the 2000 we have 300,000 jobs</text>
  <text start="307.95" dur="6.57">verse 210 thousand jobs that is the</text>
  <text start="312.57" dur="4.38">current cycle is strong but not as</text>
  <text start="314.52" dur="4.89">strong as the one in the 90s but jobless</text>
  <text start="316.95" dur="5.67">claims have collapsed even lower why</text>
  <text start="319.41" dur="7.17">it&amp;#39;s not tied to the duration it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="322.62" dur="4.73">tied to GDP what&amp;#39;s the reason for all of</text>
  <text start="326.58" dur="3.69">this</text>
  <text start="327.35" dur="4.93">it&amp;#39;s manipulated and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="330.27" dur="3.54">following this in tracking this we know</text>
  <text start="332.28" dur="4.83">there&amp;#39;s hundreds of millions of people</text>
  <text start="333.81" dur="6.09">out of work looking for work we see the</text>
  <text start="337.11" dur="6.3">ADP employment growth has slowed to the</text>
  <text start="339.9" dur="7.32">weakest in ten months we see us factory</text>
  <text start="343.41" dur="5.76">orders they have tumbled now remember a</text>
  <text start="347.22" dur="6.51">lot of the factory orders too are</text>
  <text start="349.17" dur="7.56">dependent on the defense aircraft and</text>
  <text start="353.73" dur="5.67">parts spending well that has declined so</text>
  <text start="356.73" dur="4.65">have factory orders they&amp;#39;re down by 0.8</text>
  <text start="359.4" dur="4.74">percent month on month this is the</text>
  <text start="361.38" dur="5.16">biggest drop since January what is</text>
  <text start="364.14" dur="5.76">happening behind the scenes here is that</text>
  <text start="366.54" dur="5.61">the economy is falling apart it always</text>
  <text start="369.9" dur="5.13">has been falling apart nothing&amp;#39;s changed</text>
  <text start="372.15" dur="5.1">and we can see there&amp;#39;s different</text>
  <text start="375.03" dur="4.89">analysts out there and they have been</text>
  <text start="377.25" dur="5.49">warning that we&amp;#39;re headed towards</text>
  <text start="379.92" dur="4.59">another bear market now barry Bannister</text>
  <text start="382.74" dur="5.22">and analysts who predicted the February</text>
  <text start="384.51" dur="7.11">correction warns that if the Fed raises</text>
  <text start="387.96" dur="5.61">the rates two more times to 2.9 percent</text>
  <text start="391.62" dur="3.36">and we mentioned this before if it hits</text>
  <text start="393.57" dur="4.5">around three percent the economy</text>
  <text start="394.98" dur="5.13">completely falls apart we know the Fed</text>
  <text start="398.07" dur="3.36">has said that they&amp;#39;re going to raise the</text>
  <text start="400.11" dur="4.53">rates two more times</text>
  <text start="401.43" dur="5.73">September December and when you look at</text>
  <text start="404.64" dur="4.77">what is happening here we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="407.16" dur="4.38">before and if we go back in time we can</text>
  <text start="409.41" dur="4.86">see everything every time the interest</text>
  <text start="411.54" dur="4.86">rates reached a certain point all of a</text>
  <text start="414.27" dur="5.67">sudden we had a problem now if you look</text>
  <text start="416.4" dur="7.47">at the effective Fed Funds rate versus</text>
  <text start="419.94" dur="8.48">the neutral Fed Funds rate when they</text>
  <text start="423.87" dur="6.42">cross that&amp;#39;s when we enter a bear market</text>
  <text start="428.42" dur="4.63">everything just all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="430.29" dur="5.85">completely falls apart we are almost</text>
  <text start="433.05" dur="6.24">there and if they raise the rate two</text>
  <text start="436.14" dur="5.22">more times the markets coming down now</text>
  <text start="439.29" dur="5.34">remember all of this has been planned</text>
  <text start="441.36" dur="5.64">and set up from the beginning and we can</text>
  <text start="444.63" dur="3.81">see from Trump saying listen I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="447" dur="3.9">think the Fed should be raising rates</text>
  <text start="448.44" dur="4.11">right now but they know best they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="450.9" dur="3.87">doing it for the country</text>
  <text start="452.55" dur="4.29">what he&amp;#39;s really saying is go ahead</text>
  <text start="454.77" dur="4.74">raise the rates we want the system to</text>
  <text start="456.84" dur="4.98">come down we want to blame you we also</text>
  <text start="459.51" dur="4.32">know that there&amp;#39;s news that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="461.82" dur="2.58">hit the mainstream media maybe not all</text>
  <text start="463.83" dur="3.48">at once</text>
  <text start="464.4" dur="5.94">this is about FISA and other things that</text>
  <text start="467.31" dur="6.33">is going to affect the economy the</text>
  <text start="470.34" dur="6.54">market so right now what Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="473.64" dur="6.9">is he&amp;#39;s building the narrative because</text>
  <text start="476.88" dur="6.27">now he has two different areas where he</text>
  <text start="480.54" dur="5.7">could point to when the system comes</text>
  <text start="483.15" dur="5.28">down now if the news doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="486.24" dur="3.57">budge the market or nothing really</text>
  <text start="488.43" dur="3.35">happens because the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="489.81" dur="4.02">really not reporting on it and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="491.78" dur="3.85">deflecting there they&amp;#39;re changing the</text>
  <text start="493.83" dur="4.8">story or whatever and people are</text>
  <text start="495.63" dur="6.45">rejecting it and more news hasn&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="498.63" dur="6.3">out he can always fall back on the Fed</text>
  <text start="502.08" dur="4.89">raising the rates but what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="504.93" dur="3.21">here is he&amp;#39;s not just him those people</text>
  <text start="506.97" dur="1.47">in the background that are working with</text>
  <text start="508.14" dur="2.88">him</text>
  <text start="508.44" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re building a narrative for when</text>
  <text start="511.02" dur="4.89">this entire system comes down and when</text>
  <text start="513.75" dur="4.32">it does come down everyone needs to be</text>
  <text start="515.91" dur="4.11">ready and prepared because this is going</text>
  <text start="518.07" dur="3.96">to be a complete and utter disaster and</text>
  <text start="520.02" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s gonna not gonna be easy for a lot</text>
  <text start="522.03" dur="3.57">of people a lot of people who haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="524.13" dur="2.91">been following or watching or</text>
  <text start="525.6" dur="3.51">understanding what is going on here</text>
  <text start="527.04" dur="5.9">they&amp;#39;re going to lose quite a bit</text>
  <text start="529.11" dur="7.29">especially when the dollar Falls to</text>
  <text start="532.94" dur="6.28">nothing because think about what is</text>
  <text start="536.4" dur="4.92">happening here once people start to</text>
  <text start="539.22" dur="4.23">figure out and I&amp;#39;m talking about people</text>
  <text start="541.32" dur="4.2">in other countries and other governments</text>
  <text start="543.45" dur="5.97">and they&amp;#39;re going to lose faith in the</text>
  <text start="545.52" dur="6.27">dollar especially if the corruption news</text>
  <text start="549.42" dur="4.65">comes out where we had traitors and</text>
  <text start="551.79" dur="6.12">things like that people are going to</text>
  <text start="554.07" dur="6.84">lose faith in this system and that is</text>
  <text start="557.91" dur="4.95">going to bring the system down now it</text>
  <text start="560.91" dur="4.73">might not happen the first time the news</text>
  <text start="562.86" dur="6.32">comes out but as more and more comes out</text>
  <text start="565.64" dur="6.76">well guess what it&amp;#39;s very hard to</text>
  <text start="569.18" dur="5.95">pretend it doesn&amp;#39;t exist because when</text>
  <text start="572.4" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re holing people in and arresting</text>
  <text start="575.13" dur="4.8">them you can&amp;#39;t really pretend that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="577.5" dur="5.88">not happening because it is happening</text>
  <text start="579.93" dur="5.11">now the wealthy they already know the</text>
  <text start="583.38" dur="7.06">jig is up</text>
  <text start="585.04" dur="9.299">and over the past two years the wealthy</text>
  <text start="590.44" dur="7.11">have been preparing their bunkers their</text>
  <text start="594.339" dur="8.221">other residents and a lot of them have</text>
  <text start="597.55" dur="9.269">chose New Zealand and New Zealand allows</text>
  <text start="602.56" dur="9.23">the wealthy to purchase residency there</text>
  <text start="606.819" dur="8.52">and we see already that New Zealand</text>
  <text start="611.79" dur="6.219">allows to essentially buy the residency</text>
  <text start="615.339" dur="5.221">through investor visas and the rich</text>
  <text start="618.009" dur="5.281">Americans have poured a fortune into the</text>
  <text start="620.56" dur="5.61">country often by acquiring palatial</text>
  <text start="623.29" dur="5.489">estates they set up runways we talked</text>
  <text start="626.17" dur="6.06">about this before well we see a lot more</text>
  <text start="628.779" dur="7.62">of them have done this they know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="632.23" dur="6.27">coming they understand that what is</text>
  <text start="636.399" dur="5.401">about to happen here is that everything</text>
  <text start="638.5" dur="4.949">that the deep state the central bankers</text>
  <text start="641.8" dur="4.11">have built up over the many many years</text>
  <text start="643.449" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s all coming to an end</text>
  <text start="645.91" dur="3.929">now we know that the deep state the</text>
  <text start="648.759" dur="3.721">central bankers are not going to be</text>
  <text start="649.839" dur="5.221">going quietly into the night we know</text>
  <text start="652.48" dur="4.289">that they will fight back any way they</text>
  <text start="655.06" dur="7.2">possibly can and we were already seeing</text>
  <text start="656.769" dur="7.771">this when the system comes down people</text>
  <text start="662.26" dur="3.689">are going to be very confused they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="664.54" dur="3.599">not going to understand what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="665.949" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re not going to understand why it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="668.139" dur="4.471">happening because they&amp;#39;ve been living in</text>
  <text start="670.329" dur="5.06">the matrix they&amp;#39;ve been living in an</text>
  <text start="672.61" dur="6.18">illusionary world where they believed</text>
  <text start="675.389" dur="5.411">everything that was told to them that</text>
  <text start="678.79" dur="5.099">everything is great everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="680.8" dur="3.659">fantastic the feds fantastic nothing to</text>
  <text start="683.889" dur="2.841">see here</text>
  <text start="684.459" dur="5.581">just keep doing what you&amp;#39;re doing and</text>
  <text start="686.73" dur="6.52">now their world is being turned upside</text>
  <text start="690.04" dur="6.51">down and when this happens people react</text>
  <text start="693.25" dur="6.209">in many different ways some people get</text>
  <text start="696.55" dur="4.019">angry some people hide in their house</text>
  <text start="699.459" dur="3.87">they don&amp;#39;t want to come out they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="700.569" dur="4.801">want to see people and we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="703.329" dur="5.43">many different things happen during this</text>
  <text start="705.37" dur="5.76">period and I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re that far</text>
