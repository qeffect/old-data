  <text start="32.94" dur="4.259">today&amp;#39;s date is november 9 2014 and the</text>
  <text start="35.79" dur="3.3">title of this episode is the current</text>
  <text start="37.199" dur="3.601">economic collapse news brief for this</text>
  <text start="39.09" dur="2.999">sunday now we understand that europe is</text>
  <text start="40.8" dur="3.329">completely falling apart they&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="42.089" dur="4.261">recession / depression and it is</text>
  <text start="44.129" dur="4.831">definitely getting worse in europe of</text>
  <text start="46.35" dur="3.779">course the eurozone trying to convince</text>
  <text start="48.96" dur="2.82">everyone that things are going to be</text>
  <text start="50.129" dur="3.21">getting better as time goes on they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="51.78" dur="4.23">going to see improvement but as we can</text>
  <text start="53.339" dur="4.171">see this has never come true and it is</text>
  <text start="56.01" dur="3.479">always the opposite of what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="57.51" dur="5.25">saying here in the United States we have</text>
  <text start="59.489" dur="5.941">noticed that the credit card spending is</text>
  <text start="62.76" dur="5.96">starting to slow and we&amp;#39;re seeing auto</text>
  <text start="65.43" dur="7.31">loans and student loans that bubble is</text>
  <text start="68.72" dur="6.639">being inflated another month another</text>
  <text start="72.74" dur="6.699">14.5 billion increase in student loan</text>
  <text start="75.359" dur="6.33">and car loans offset by a measly 1.4</text>
  <text start="79.439" dur="4.261">billion in credit card debt the credit</text>
  <text start="81.689" dur="4.261">card buying spree from late spring is</text>
  <text start="83.7" dur="3.93">long gone the past two months have</text>
  <text start="85.95" dur="3.739">reverted to the old normal the</text>
  <text start="87.63" dur="4.32">government is the sole provider of</text>
  <text start="89.689" dur="5.771">consumer credit and we can see that</text>
  <text start="91.95" dur="5.79">again people do not have the same jobs</text>
  <text start="95.46" dur="4.14">they once had before right now we</text>
  <text start="97.74" dur="3.239">understand the unemployment come down to</text>
  <text start="99.6" dur="3.059">five point eight percent but that is</text>
  <text start="100.979" dur="4.17">completely meaningless because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="102.659" dur="6.84">replacing these fantastic good jobs with</text>
  <text start="105.149" dur="5.79">these terrible low-paying jobs that we</text>
  <text start="109.499" dur="3.3">can see most of those people who are</text>
  <text start="110.939" dur="5.07">getting laid off right now who cannot</text>
  <text start="112.799" dur="5.07">find work they are taking part time work</text>
  <text start="116.009" dur="3.39">just trying to make ends meet some</text>
  <text start="117.869" dur="3.54">people are taking more than one job</text>
  <text start="119.399" dur="4.411">because they just can&amp;#39;t find those same</text>
  <text start="121.409" dur="4.441">exact jobs making that same exact salary</text>
  <text start="123.81" dur="5.28">and it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder for</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="5.159">people now out in Ferguson we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="129.09" dur="3.63">reports and people are writing in that</text>
  <text start="131.009" dur="3.601">they&amp;#39;re seeing a lot of military</text>
  <text start="132.72" dur="4.23">vehicles and armored vehicles being</text>
  <text start="134.61" dur="3.659">moved into that area and it looks like</text>
  <text start="136.95" dur="3.119">they&amp;#39;re getting in prep they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="138.269" dur="2.701">ready for what&amp;#39;s going to happen i</text>
  <text start="140.069" dur="3.421">believe on november</text>
  <text start="140.97" dur="4.95">10th which is the grand jury indictment</text>
  <text start="143.49" dur="4.59">I mean right now it looks like the</text>
  <text start="145.92" dur="4.26">police officer will not be indicted so</text>
  <text start="148.08" dur="4.14">it looks like Ferguson is getting</text>
  <text start="150.18" dur="4.35">prepared they&amp;#39;re nervous that is going</text>
  <text start="152.22" dur="3.93">to be writing and again there are</text>
  <text start="154.53" dur="3">experts out there saying that if this</text>
  <text start="156.15" dur="3.36">goes down the way they think it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="157.53" dur="5.28">to go down we&amp;#39;re going to see something</text>
  <text start="159.51" dur="5.4">like la when Rodney King verdict came</text>
  <text start="162.81" dur="3.06">down and we&amp;#39;re going to see riots just</text>
  <text start="164.91" dur="3.78">like that and we&amp;#39;re going to have to</text>
  <text start="165.87" dur="5.91">watch the situation very very carefully</text>
  <text start="168.69" dur="5.31">because we know that there are outside</text>
  <text start="171.78" dur="5.28">agent provocateurs that come into the</text>
  <text start="174" dur="5.37">city they try to rile everything up try</text>
  <text start="177.06" dur="3.78">to get the people going and that we have</text>
  <text start="179.37" dur="3.93">to watch this because if this starts</text>
  <text start="180.84" dur="4.619">spreading across the country we know and</text>
  <text start="183.3" dur="4.14">we understand the government would love</text>
  <text start="185.459" dur="4.171">to suspend the Constitution bring in</text>
  <text start="187.44" dur="5.22">martial law bring in the military police</text>
  <text start="189.63" dur="5.19">to control the situation and show the</text>
  <text start="192.66" dur="5.46">entire country this is what happens when</text>
  <text start="194.82" dur="5.94">you start to do something and not obey</text>
  <text start="198.12" dur="5.07">what we&amp;#39;re trying to tell you here now</text>
  <text start="200.76" dur="5.1">we understand in Spain the Catalonian</text>
  <text start="203.19" dur="6.54">they are now having a referendum they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="205.86" dur="5.97">voting and of course it most likely is</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="4.83">probably fixed but it looks like there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="211.83" dur="5.22">a high number of cattle ons who are</text>
  <text start="214.56" dur="4.77">voting and it looks like millions of</text>
  <text start="217.05" dur="3.96">people have come out to do this of</text>
  <text start="219.33" dur="4.23">course Spain is out there saying this is</text>
  <text start="221.01" dur="3.84">a waste of time it&amp;#39;s meaningless it</text>
  <text start="223.56" dur="4.59">doesn&amp;#39;t really mean anything and we have</text>
  <text start="224.85" dur="5.76">to remember Madrid sent military units</text>
  <text start="228.15" dur="7.2">out to this area just in case something</text>
  <text start="230.61" dur="6.42">should go wrong in that area now in my</text>
  <text start="235.35" dur="4.38">couple reports back we understand that</text>
  <text start="237.03" dur="6.6">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="239.73" dur="6.06">bankers do not want Russia to purchase</text>
  <text start="243.63" dur="3.21">those Mistral ships from France and</text>
  <text start="245.79" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re doing everything they possibly</text>
  <text start="246.84" dur="5.25">can to stop the sales they actually they</text>
  <text start="249.42" dur="5.099">want NATO to come in and purchase these</text>
  <text start="252.09" dur="4.139">ships and right now NATO doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="254.519" dur="4.141">the necessary funds to meet the demands</text>
  <text start="256.229" dur="4.681">of the US lawmakers and purchase the</text>
  <text start="258.66" dur="4.11">french-built Mistral Schwartz in order</text>
  <text start="260.91" dur="5.069">to prevent Russia from getting the</text>
  <text start="262.77" dur="5.97">vessels NATO&amp;#39;s budget is too small to</text>
  <text start="265.979" dur="4.711">not only purchase rusher ordered Mistral</text>
  <text start="268.74" dur="4.44">helicopter carries but to even</text>
  <text start="270.69" dur="3.99">compensate France half of the penalties</text>
  <text start="273.18" dur="3.48">in accordance with the contract now</text>
  <text start="274.68" dur="4.859">and Russia and France they have a</text>
  <text start="276.66" dur="5.009">contract we saw this incident where was</text>
  <text start="279.539" dur="4.801">a coup d&amp;#39;etat in Ukraine where the</text>
  <text start="281.669" dur="4.62">United States and the private western</text>
  <text start="284.34" dur="3.87">central bank countries came in and they</text>
  <text start="286.289" dur="4.44">overthrew the elected government and</text>
  <text start="288.21" dur="4.29">pretty much brought in a puppet</text>
  <text start="290.729" dur="3.631">government in place and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="292.5" dur="3.87">we had war that was started and they</text>
  <text start="294.36" dur="3.75">blamed everything on Russia and we can</text>
  <text start="296.37" dur="3.87">see right now that Russia is not to</text>
  <text start="298.11" dur="3.99">blame for this this was planned by the</text>
  <text start="300.24" dur="3.54">united states that of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="302.1" dur="4.11">continually saying that russia has not</text>
  <text start="303.78" dur="4.47">met the conditions to receive these</text>
  <text start="306.21" dur="4.98">ships and the conditions are get all</text>
  <text start="308.25" dur="5.37">your troops stop the war in ukraine and</text>
  <text start="311.19" dur="5.789">again putin has tried to do this with a</text>
  <text start="313.62" dur="5.82">peace plan and if we look at it the</text>
  <text start="316.979" dur="4.321">united states central bankers the EU and</text>
  <text start="319.44" dur="4.05">all the other countries never even</text>
  <text start="321.3" dur="4.2">talked about peace until russia came in</text>
  <text start="323.49" dur="5.22">and said listen let&amp;#39;s have a ceasefire</text>
  <text start="325.5" dur="5.28">here&amp;#39;s a 12 point plan and let&amp;#39;s go for</text>
  <text start="328.71" dur="4.47">it and again what are we seeing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="330.78" dur="5.04">seeing the Ukraine the Kiev puppet</text>
  <text start="333.18" dur="4.26">government once again pushing war in</text>
  <text start="335.82" dur="4.879">this region because again the central</text>
  <text start="337.44" dur="6.33">bankers have not got what they pay for</text>
  <text start="340.699" dur="4.241">now John McCain is out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.77" dur="2.82">saying the United States and the</text>
  <text start="344.94" dur="3.93">European Union should introduce more</text>
  <text start="346.59" dur="4.98">sanctions against Russia and supply</text>
  <text start="348.87" dur="4.979">lethal weapons to Kiev if reports of</text>
  <text start="351.57" dur="4.379">Russia&amp;#39;s alleged incursion into Ukraine</text>
  <text start="353.849" dur="5.491">are confirmed and this is coming from</text>
  <text start="355.949" dur="6.991">John McCain now truthfully if they were</text>
  <text start="359.34" dur="6.06">confirmed would they would have</text>
  <text start="362.94" dur="4.8">satellite images they would have video</text>
  <text start="365.4" dur="5.699">they would have photos and they&amp;#39;d be all</text>
  <text start="367.74" dur="5.419">over the place showing all of this that</text>
  <text start="371.099" dur="5.281">it did occur and what are we seeing</text>
  <text start="373.159" dur="5.561">absolutely nothing the Organization for</text>
  <text start="376.38" dur="5.46">Security and Cooperation in Europe the</text>
  <text start="378.72" dur="5.009">OSCE confirms the shelling of the school</text>
  <text start="381.84" dur="4.53">in Donetsk was made from the side of</text>
  <text start="383.729" dur="4.461">Ukraine&amp;#39;s military and the Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="386.37" dur="5.039">side is trying to fabricate proofs of</text>
  <text start="388.19" dur="5.53">non-involvement the facts prove that the</text>
  <text start="391.409" dur="4.651">shelling was made from artillery from</text>
  <text start="393.72" dur="4.47">the direction and distance which no</text>
  <text start="396.06" dur="4.59">doubt are at location of the Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="398.19" dur="6.63">military near the airport and settlement</text>
  <text start="400.65" dur="6.03">and we can see right now they always do</text>
  <text start="404.82" dur="3.429">this and I&amp;#39;m talking about Ukraine where</text>
  <text start="406.68" dur="3.399">they say no we had nothing to do this</text>
  <text start="408.249" dur="5.16">we didn&amp;#39;t shoot down mh17 that was the</text>
  <text start="410.079" dur="8.4">Russians we didn&amp;#39;t fire or use white</text>
  <text start="413.409" dur="7.44">phosphorus or uh start the the military</text>
  <text start="418.479" dur="4.11">offensive no it wasn&amp;#39;t us it was always</text>
  <text start="420.849" dur="5.01">the other side and we can see they</text>
  <text start="422.589" dur="5.88">continually make up propaganda Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="425.859" dur="4.98">invading Russia is building troops up on</text>
  <text start="428.469" dur="4.47">the border and every single time there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="430.839" dur="4.32">absolutely no proof there is nothing to</text>
  <text start="432.939" dur="3.68">back it up there&amp;#39;s no satellite images</text>
  <text start="435.159" dur="4.23">and I&amp;#39;m not talking about those ones</text>
  <text start="436.619" dur="5.2">from 1970 which are black and white and</text>
  <text start="439.389" dur="3.81">blurry and they start painting things in</text>
  <text start="441.819" dur="4.08">with Photoshop to convince us that</text>
  <text start="443.199" dur="7.47">something is happening now the OSCE they</text>
  <text start="445.899" dur="8.22">also said that the ceasefire violations</text>
  <text start="450.669" dur="8.07">are from the Ukrainian side they are</text>
  <text start="454.119" dur="7.05">continually pretty much in violation of</text>
  <text start="458.739" dur="4.44">all these ceasefires and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="461.169" dur="4.53">recording each one of these to show that</text>
  <text start="463.179" dur="4.41">yes it is the Kiev government that is</text>
  <text start="465.699" dur="4.17">doing this now the Pentagon is out there</text>
  <text start="467.589" dur="4.11">and they&amp;#39;re saying that they have</text>
  <text start="469.869" dur="3.6">absolutely no evidence confirming</text>
  <text start="471.699" dur="4.53">Russian military hardware sending to</text>
  <text start="473.469" dur="6">Ukraine and US State Department</text>
  <text start="476.229" dur="5.19">spokesman John Jen Psaki said earlier</text>
  <text start="479.469" dur="4.65">Friday that the United States could not</text>
  <text start="481.419" dur="5.88">confirm the reports so basically they</text>
  <text start="484.119" dur="5.67">have absolutely nothing it was all</text>
  <text start="487.299" dur="5.34">propaganda to convince everyone that</text>
  <text start="489.789" dur="5.49">Russia was invading and like i said if</text>
  <text start="492.639" dur="5.971">russia was truly invading they would</text>
  <text start="495.279" dur="6.42">have the clearest Crispus satellite</text>
  <text start="498.61" dur="5.069">imagery 3d everything that you could</text>
  <text start="501.699" dur="4.53">make out that it was Russia and they</text>
  <text start="503.679" dur="4.14">have absolutely nothing and again what</text>
  <text start="506.229" dur="3.9">would be the motivation of Russia to</text>
  <text start="507.819" dur="5.1">invade they orchestrated a peace deal</text>
  <text start="510.129" dur="4.921">there is absolutely no reason again</text>
  <text start="512.919" dur="4.951">Putin doesn&amp;#39;t work in this manner watch</text>
  <text start="515.05" dur="5.399">the actions not the words and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="517.87" dur="5.13">what we&amp;#39;re watching right now now</text>
  <text start="520.449" dur="6.45">President Obama was saying that no we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="523" dur="6.54">sending more troops into the Iraqi area</text>
  <text start="526.899" dur="4.41">this is not mission creep they are not</text>
  <text start="529.54" dur="3.69">there for combat missions they are</text>
  <text start="531.309" dur="3.63">combat ready but they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="533.23" dur="4.709">get involved in any type of combat</text>
  <text start="534.939" dur="5.34">therefore advisory and training and that</text>
  <text start="537.939" dur="3.611">is it but as you see they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="540.279" dur="3.941">sending more and more</text>
  <text start="541.55" dur="4.86">of these combat-ready advisors into Iraq</text>
  <text start="544.22" dur="3.869">and before you know it what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="546.41" dur="4.859">happen is we&amp;#39;re going to see this number</text>
  <text start="548.089" dur="5.221">increase probably double triple because</text>
  <text start="551.269" dur="3.781">they are getting prepared for a force to</text>
  <text start="553.31" dur="3.99">arrive in Iraq because they took over</text>
  <text start="555.05" dur="4.26">that air base in iraq they set up a</text>
  <text start="557.3" dur="3.719">division headquarters and you can see</text>
  <text start="559.31" dur="2.969">that yes this is definitely mission</text>
  <text start="561.019" dur="6.931">creep and everything these government</text>
  <text start="562.279" dur="8.221">officials say is always the opposite now</text>

  <text start="624.649" dur="5.071">United States is behind all this we knew</text>
  <text start="628.01" dur="4.47">this from the beginning we know Israel&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="629.72" dur="5.58">behind it we know the UK is behind this</text>
  <text start="632.48" dur="4.95">and all the ever private was in Central</text>
  <text start="635.3" dur="4.8">Bank countries they&amp;#39;re all behind the</text>
  <text start="637.43" dur="4.469">Islamic state it is a perfect proxy army</text>
  <text start="640.1" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re not part of any government they</text>
  <text start="641.899" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t have to listen to the UN or</text>
  <text start="643.7" dur="3.69">anything like that and they can maneuver</text>
  <text start="645.649" dur="3.961">wherever they want now of course there</text>
  <text start="647.39" dur="4.889">is news now saying that the United</text>

  <text start="652.279" dur="4.141">Baghdad II might be in there and I see</text>
  <text start="654.529" dur="5.341">news coming out now that he is wounded</text>
  <text start="656.42" dur="6.18">and again who knows what really happened</text>
  <text start="659.87" dur="5.67">and was this really the Islamic state or</text>
  <text start="662.6" dur="5.4">was the people rising up and this is the</text>
  <text start="665.54" dur="6.72">convoy that they hit because as we see</text>
  <text start="668" dur="6">in Iraq Yemen Lebanon and Libya we see</text>
  <text start="672.26" dur="3.24">the people rising up there using the</text>
  <text start="674" dur="3.72">Islamic state to cause</text>
  <text start="675.5" dur="3.66">us to convince us that it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="677.72" dur="3.36">fighting the Islamic say but what</text>
  <text start="679.16" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re really fighting is the people</text>
  <text start="681.08" dur="3.96">who are rising up in these countries and</text>
  <text start="683.54" dur="4.71">every time you hear a leader being</text>
  <text start="685.04" dur="6.51">killed or hurt it is the people and</text>
  <text start="688.25" dur="6.15">those leaders that they are striking now</text>
  <text start="691.55" dur="4.98">as we know turkey completely supports</text>
  <text start="694.4" dur="3.9">the Islamic state they let them go in</text>
  <text start="696.53" dur="4.11">and out through their borders they</text>
  <text start="698.3" dur="4.26">support them they fund them they allowed</text>
  <text start="700.64" dur="4.26">them to take the oil out and sell it to</text>
  <text start="702.56" dur="4.41">other places and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="704.9" dur="3.48">now is they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us</text>
  <text start="706.97" dur="3">that the Islamic state militants have</text>
  <text start="708.38" dur="4.65">seized an oil field and refineries in</text>
  <text start="709.97" dur="4.92">Kirkuk province in the north of Iraq and</text>
  <text start="713.03" dur="4.26">they are selling the hijacked oil on the</text>
  <text start="714.89" dur="5.58">black market for twenty dollars a barrel</text>
  <text start="717.29" dur="5.43">using the US dollars now we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="720.47" dur="4.77">many times before the United States</text>
  <text start="722.72" dur="4.47">central bankers they know exactly who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="725.24" dur="4.2">selling the oil and for what currency</text>
  <text start="727.19" dur="4.26">now again why would they use US dollars</text>
  <text start="729.44" dur="5.82">it makes no sense whatsoever because the</text>
  <text start="731.45" dur="6.81">people in Libya who boarded a took oil</text>
  <text start="735.26" dur="5.4">and put it on a tanker set sail looking</text>
  <text start="738.26" dur="4.26">for a buyer the Navy SEALs were on top</text>
  <text start="740.66" dur="3.54">of that ship in no time flat bringing it</text>
  <text start="742.52" dur="4.02">right back because they realized that</text>
  <text start="744.2" dur="3.93">the people of Libya were going to sell</text>
  <text start="746.54" dur="3.66">this not using the u.s. dollar but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="748.13" dur="4.62">amazing the terrorist group continually</text>
  <text start="750.2" dur="4.11">stays with the US dollar and sells it on</text>
  <text start="752.75" dur="2.94">the black market why don&amp;#39;t they sell it</text>
  <text start="754.31" dur="3.029">for gold why don&amp;#39;t they sell it for</text>
  <text start="755.69" dur="3.45">silver why don&amp;#39;t they sell it for</text>
  <text start="757.339" dur="4.531">anything but the US dollar because they</text>
  <text start="759.14" dur="5.73">have a deal with the United States</text>
  <text start="761.87" dur="5.49">central bankers that this oil has to be</text>
  <text start="764.87" dur="3.96">sold using the US dollar and we can see</text>
  <text start="767.36" dur="3.93">right now they are continually doing</text>
  <text start="768.83" dur="4.5">this Iraq&amp;#39;s diplomatic agency in oil</text>
  <text start="771.29" dur="4.71">ministry are actively working on finding</text>
  <text start="773.33" dur="5.16">those who buy oil from the group and to</text>
  <text start="776" dur="4.47">inform the international community on it</text>
  <text start="778.49" dur="4.17">for taking appropriate action and we</text>
  <text start="780.47" dur="4.29">know for a fact that they know exactly</text>
  <text start="782.66" dur="5.52">where all the soils going we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="784.76" dur="5.91">being sent up in convoys and trucks into</text>
  <text start="788.18" dur="4.77">Turkey then sent out to like Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="790.67" dur="4.44">other areas and they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="792.95" dur="4.17">doing this now as we know turkey is</text>
  <text start="795.11" dur="3.69">supporting the Islamic state they</text>
  <text start="797.12" dur="2.64">allowed them to move across the borders</text>
  <text start="798.8" dur="2.91">and it looks like there&amp;#39;s about a</text>
  <text start="799.76" dur="4.17">thousand terrorists that have crossed</text>
  <text start="801.71" dur="3.68">from the Turkish border into Syria looks</text>
  <text start="803.93" dur="4.35">like they&amp;#39;re releasing more terrorism</text>
  <text start="805.39" dur="3.62">into Syria which actually what really</text>
  <text start="808.28" dur="2.89">has happening</text>
  <text start="809.01" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re going into it lip and Aleppo and</text>
  <text start="811.17" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re going to be battling in that</text>
  <text start="813.15" dur="4.35">area and if you look at the movement of</text>
  <text start="815.58" dur="4.44">the Islamic state they went up the east</text>
  <text start="817.5" dur="3.81">side of Syria across the North because</text>
  <text start="820.02" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s where they wanted the buffer zone</text>
  <text start="821.31" dur="5.19">now they&amp;#39;re heading toward it lib coming</text>
  <text start="823.83" dur="5.22">down to Damascus and this whole thing is</text>
  <text start="826.5" dur="5.64">to clear out this entire area to go</text>
  <text start="829.05" dur="4.38">after Assad once the time comes and we</text>
  <text start="832.14" dur="4.35">can see that troops are now being</text>
  <text start="833.43" dur="5.22">brought into Iraq we see they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="836.49" dur="6.09">prepared in Syria and this thing is</text>
  <text start="838.65" dur="6.36">going to go hot very very soon now DHS</text>
  <text start="842.58" dur="5.67">is giving us more warnings now about</text>
  <text start="845.01" dur="7.7">malware and Trojans that are stuck in</text>
  <text start="848.25" dur="7.14">the financial system there&amp;#39;s a new</text>

  <text start="855.39" dur="6.15">pronounce this dy re dire that is in the</text>
  <text start="858.96" dur="4.65">banking system and it has been spotted</text>

  <text start="863.61" dur="5.67">large enterprises and major financial</text>
  <text start="865.92" dur="6">institutions they do believe that you</text>
  <text start="869.28" dur="4.86">know it could be from Russia it could be</text>
  <text start="871.92" dur="3.45">from China they&amp;#39;re not really sure at</text>
  <text start="874.14" dur="2.67">this time but we&amp;#39;re getting a lot of</text>

  <text start="879.93" dur="3.42">black energy malware and we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="882.03" dur="3.24">to see this happen a lot because what</text>
  <text start="883.35" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re getting ready for is a huge</text>
  <text start="885.27" dur="3.84">false flag event and they&amp;#39;ve got to make</text>
  <text start="886.89" dur="4.11">sure that everyone realizes that Russia</text>
  <text start="889.11" dur="3.39">or China is going to be responsible for</text>
  <text start="891" dur="2.61">all this and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised in</text>
  <text start="892.5" dur="3.35">a couple days that they come out and</text>
  <text start="893.61" dur="4.74">they say this is really another Russian</text>

  <text start="910.71" dur="3.42">this is all being set up for the false</text>
  <text start="912.3" dur="3.27">flag event and we know that this is</text>
  <text start="914.13" dur="3.57">going to be done from the inside from</text>
  <text start="915.57" dur="5.67">the central bankers to cover up the</text>
  <text start="917.7" dur="5.31">entire collapse system and again if they</text>

  <text start="944.2" dur="3.39">of course this will be coupled with</text>
  <text start="945.58" dur="3.66">physical attacks most likely from the</text>
  <text start="947.59" dur="3.42">Islamic state to bring us into the</text>
