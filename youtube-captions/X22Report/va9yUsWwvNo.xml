  <text start="94.57" dur="4.83">the same track with Syria and it looks</text>
  <text start="97.24" dur="3.419">like something is definitely going to</text>

  <text start="118.409" dur="6.46">looking like it&amp;#39;s going to fade out and</text>
  <text start="121.27" dur="6.419">crash 16 forecasters 8 said they were</text>
  <text start="124.869" dur="5.37">slightly concerned that after more than</text>
  <text start="127.689" dur="5.55">a decade of rapid increases in home</text>
  <text start="130.239" dur="6.18">prices they may be at risk of a sharp</text>

  <text start="136.419" dur="4.801">they were concerned while three said</text>
  <text start="138.309" dur="4.471">they were very concerned still a</text>
  <text start="141.22" dur="4.02">course the government officials and</text>
  <text start="142.78" dur="4.74">everyone else who was out there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="145.24" dur="4.47">saying no no no we think housing prices</text>
  <text start="147.52" dur="4.44">are going to rise we believe that</text>
  <text start="149.71" dur="5.31">everything will be okay but then again</text>
  <text start="151.96" dur="5.16">we heard this back in 2008 of course in</text>
  <text start="155.02" dur="3.33">the United States when the Fed was out</text>
  <text start="157.12" dur="3.72">there and all the other countries are</text>
  <text start="158.35" dur="4.86">falling along that everything was fine</text>
  <text start="160.84" dur="4.59">there is no recession coming up look</text>
  <text start="163.21" dur="5.85">away from this area but we know better</text>
  <text start="165.43" dur="6.3">they never tell you the truth they</text>
  <text start="169.06" dur="5.04">always tell you the opposite of what is</text>
  <text start="171.73" dur="5.28">happening and we can see by looking all</text>
  <text start="174.1" dur="5.61">around the world the entire system is</text>
  <text start="177.01" dur="4.74">imploding on itself and they do not know</text>
  <text start="179.71" dur="4.26">what to do they don&amp;#39;t know how to get</text>
  <text start="181.75" dur="5.49">out of this so what they continually do</text>
  <text start="183.97" dur="6.36">is they try to push the private western</text>
  <text start="187.24" dur="6.06">central banking debt across the world by</text>
  <text start="190.33" dur="4.98">invading other nations maybe not using</text>
  <text start="193.3" dur="8.45">their own forces like the United States</text>
  <text start="195.31" dur="9.72">Army or the EU Armed Forces they use</text>
  <text start="201.75" dur="5.56">agent provocateurs to help out they pay</text>
  <text start="205.03" dur="4.26">for mercenaries they pay for rebels and</text>
  <text start="207.31" dur="3.99">they create these groups and of course</text>
  <text start="209.29" dur="5.04">all this money that they&amp;#39;re paying come</text>
  <text start="211.3" dur="5.43">from different locations one could be</text>
  <text start="214.33" dur="4.26">like Afghanistan the opium fields the</text>
  <text start="216.73" dur="4.35">poppy fields which they sell for opium</text>
  <text start="218.59" dur="4.98">and this is how they use the money in</text>
  <text start="221.08" dur="3.93">these other areas and of course we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="223.57" dur="4.139">seeing what&amp;#39;s happening in the Ukraine</text>
  <text start="225.01" dur="4.05">the EU I&amp;#39;m sure all the central bankers</text>
  <text start="227.709" dur="4.321">are patting themselves on the back going</text>
  <text start="229.06" dur="5.19">yes we have the Ukraine it is ours but</text>
  <text start="232.03" dur="4.95">it really isn&amp;#39;t but of course they think</text>
  <text start="234.25" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re done they think they have it all</text>
  <text start="236.98" dur="4.229">in the bag they think everything is</text>
  <text start="239.11" dur="4.05">going to be fine because they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="241.209" dur="4.56">the debt further and further out into</text>
  <text start="243.16" dur="5.25">other countries so of course since they</text>
  <text start="245.769" dur="3.781">believe that they have Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="248.41" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re going to put them on the EU</text>
  <text start="249.55" dur="4.92">system they&amp;#39;re already coming out with</text>
  <text start="252.1" dur="5.4">forecasts saying everything is great</text>
  <text start="254.47" dur="6.66">Spain&amp;#39;s economy is going to grow one</text>
  <text start="257.5" dur="5.85">percent in 2014 how is this possibly</text>
  <text start="261.13" dur="4.08">going to happen I don&amp;#39;t know but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="263.35" dur="3.69">coming out with these amazing forecasts</text>
  <text start="265.21" dur="4.26">that things are just going to all of a</text>
  <text start="267.04" dur="4.379">sudden get better unemployment just</text>
  <text start="269.47" dur="3.87">going to disappear and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="271.419" dur="3.531">going to start producing manufacturing</text>
  <text start="273.34" dur="4.76">even though the country</text>
  <text start="274.95" dur="5.37">is weighed down with billions and</text>
  <text start="278.1" dur="5.52">billions of dollars worth of debt the</text>
  <text start="280.32" dur="5.85">people are not working the youth of the</text>
  <text start="283.62" dur="4.86">country are not working but just somehow</text>
  <text start="286.17" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s all going to get better and of</text>
  <text start="288.48" dur="6">course they&amp;#39;re out there saying the</text>
  <text start="290.82" dur="6.45">worst maybe maybe behind us the eurozone</text>
  <text start="294.48" dur="6.63">growth outlook raised slightly to 1.2</text>
  <text start="297.27" dur="6.09">percent for 2014 and that they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="301.11" dur="4.86">that the in the high debt and high</text>
  <text start="303.36" dur="5.19">unemployment will continue to stall the</text>
  <text start="305.97" dur="6">recovery in the 18 member eurozone but</text>
  <text start="308.55" dur="7.26">they believe that the eurozone GDP will</text>
  <text start="311.97" dur="6.09">grow by 1.2 percent in 2014 because they</text>
  <text start="315.81" dur="4.26">think they have got in they&amp;#39;ve gotten</text>
  <text start="318.06" dur="4.44">into the Ukraine and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="320.07" dur="4.77">spread this out to other countries that</text>
  <text start="322.5" dur="4.98">they are doing what they need to do to</text>
  <text start="324.84" dur="6.93">keep this system propped up but we know</text>
  <text start="327.48" dur="6.48">this is not going to work and they also</text>
  <text start="331.77" dur="4.14">go on to say that we understand that the</text>
  <text start="333.96" dur="3.69">unemployment is around 12 to 12 point 2</text>
  <text start="335.91" dur="3.66">percent and we feel that the</text>
  <text start="337.65" dur="4.56">unemployment levels across the eurozone</text>
  <text start="339.57" dur="6.36">is going to fall to 12 percent in the</text>
  <text start="342.21" dur="6.27">coming year and sovereign debt will inch</text>
  <text start="345.93" dur="4.8">up to ninety five point nine percent of</text>
  <text start="348.48" dur="4.08">GDP so that&amp;#39;s going to go up</text>
  <text start="350.73" dur="3.06">unemployment is going to come down and</text>
  <text start="352.56" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re just going to all start</text>
  <text start="353.79" dur="6.09">manufacturing and sell their products to</text>
  <text start="356.28" dur="5.01">WHO and that they they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="359.88" dur="2.34">everyone and they&amp;#39;re using this</text>
  <text start="361.29" dur="3.36">propaganda tably</text>
  <text start="362.22" dur="4.44">to make them believe that things are</text>
  <text start="364.65" dur="4.41">going to be okay and we know better than</text>
  <text start="366.66" dur="4.32">this we know that the entire system is</text>
  <text start="369.06" dur="5.07">imploding we know that they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="370.98" dur="8.61">the Ukraine we understand that Russia is</text>
  <text start="374.13" dur="9.6">moving into the Crimea area and they</text>
  <text start="379.59" dur="6.93">will never get this the the the south</text>
  <text start="383.73" dur="5.19">and the East portion of the Ukraine all</text>
  <text start="386.52" dur="4.23">they have is Kiev and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="388.92" dur="4.47">rewrite all the laws they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="390.75" dur="4.47">create a whole new constitution they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="393.39" dur="3.39">trying to put the entire system on the</text>
  <text start="395.22" dur="3.18">EU and this is why they&amp;#39;re rushing</text>
  <text start="396.78" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re supposed to have elections today</text>
  <text start="398.4" dur="4.5">but these were put off right now</text>
  <text start="401.28" dur="3.24">because they&amp;#39;re having quite a bit of</text>
  <text start="402.9" dur="4.41">problems there because basically the</text>
  <text start="404.52" dur="4.08">country is broke but let&amp;#39;s go further</text>
  <text start="407.31" dur="4.62">into the economic</text>
  <text start="408.6" dur="7.23">newse here now in the United States what</text>
  <text start="411.93" dur="6.3">we&amp;#39;re seeing is the housing market has</text>
  <text start="415.83" dur="5.46">not been doing well at all</text>
  <text start="418.23" dur="5.58">and we understand that the government</text>
  <text start="421.29" dur="5.76">officials the Fed they&amp;#39;re all out there</text>
  <text start="423.81" dur="5.67">telling us how the housing market is</text>

  <text start="444.48" dur="3.3">it&amp;#39;s the complete opposite of what</text>
  <text start="446.19" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re saying and right now the</text>
  <text start="447.78" dur="5.1">case-shiller they&amp;#39;ve come out and</text>
  <text start="450.21" dur="5.69">they&amp;#39;re saying it the house it&amp;#39;s warning</text>

  <text start="455.9" dur="6.07">terrible this cannot be sustained it</text>
  <text start="459.45" dur="5.85">will not be sustained it will come</text>
  <text start="461.97" dur="5.28">crashing down and of course we</text>

  <text start="476.82" dur="6.33">understand that the major mortgage</text>
  <text start="480.12" dur="6.69">companies those departments started</text>
  <text start="483.15" dur="6.06">laying off in September and October it</text>
  <text start="486.81" dur="5.36">was very quiet because they understood</text>
  <text start="489.21" dur="7.68">that this housing market was in a</text>
  <text start="492.17" dur="7.54">complete illusion it is not real and of</text>
  <text start="496.89" dur="4.44">course they&amp;#39;re going to keep continually</text>
  <text start="499.71" dur="3.81">going on saying that everything&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="501.33" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s the weather that&amp;#39;s why people</text>

  <text start="520.469" dur="5.191">percent unemployment is closer to thirty</text>
  <text start="523.86" dur="3.96">percent depending on the calculation</text>
  <text start="525.66" dur="3.57">there was an executive on Wall Street</text>
  <text start="527.82" dur="5.37">who said it was around thirty seven</text>
  <text start="529.23" dur="5.88">percent the youth of America cannot</text>

  <text start="576.209" dur="5.101">see all the banks going coming out with</text>
  <text start="579.089" dur="4.711">a hundred percent financing reverting</text>
  <text start="581.31" dur="4.8">back to adjustable rate mortgages and</text>
  <text start="583.8" dur="4.44">even going into the subprime market</text>
  <text start="586.11" dur="4.05">because they realize they need to do</text>
  <text start="588.24" dur="3.51">everything they possibly can to keep</text>
  <text start="590.16" dur="3.11">this housing market going and we also</text>
  <text start="591.75" dur="6.6">have to understand those people who</text>
  <text start="593.27" dur="7.03">owned homes have bad credit think about</text>
  <text start="598.35" dur="4.02">the amount of foreclosures and the</text>
  <text start="600.3" dur="4.83">amount of short sales this is why the</text>

  <text start="621.839" dur="5.581">survive this is what we are seeing right</text>
  <text start="624.81" dur="5.399">now and these are the facts so the</text>
  <text start="627.42" dur="4.89">housing market cannot get any better and</text>

  <text start="912.4" dur="4.44">nowhere this is going to be the major</text>
  <text start="914.56" dur="4.68">problem when we see Bank of America lay</text>

  <text start="923.41" dur="4.74">people going to go they have no place to</text>

  <text start="928.15" dur="6.93">probably come down again to 6.4 percent</text>
  <text start="929.83" dur="7.53">and of course another banker has been</text>
  <text start="935.08" dur="4.47">found dead and again we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="937.36" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re cleaning house they&amp;#39;re getting</text>

  <text start="943.81" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re getting rid of more and more</text>
  <text start="945.34" dur="6.08">bankers and we&amp;#39;re seeing this pretty</text>
  <text start="947.26" dur="7.91">much everywhere now if you remember back</text>
  <text start="951.42" dur="8.08">this was back in 2011 when S&amp;amp;P</text>
  <text start="955.17" dur="7.66">downgraded the United States Geithner</text>
  <text start="959.5" dur="6.089">Obama the Obama administration were very</text>
  <text start="962.83" dur="4.56">very angry with S&amp;amp;P and then all of a</text>
  <text start="965.589" dur="3.721">sudden there was a lawsuit well now</text>
  <text start="967.39" dur="4.35">there&amp;#39;s more information coming out and</text>
  <text start="969.31" dur="4.469">from Standard &amp;amp; Poor&amp;#39;s said a meeting</text>
  <text start="971.74" dur="4.73">between President Barack Obama and his</text>

  <text start="980.56" dur="7.2">to press charges against S&amp;amp;P and sue</text>
  <text start="984.79" dur="5.67">them so we can see this was definitely</text>
  <text start="987.76" dur="6.03">planned it was it was completely in</text>
  <text start="990.46" dur="6.36">response to the downgrade in America and</text>
  <text start="993.79" dur="4.77">they took action so we can see what is</text>
  <text start="996.82" dur="4.17">going on here because they need to keep</text>
  <text start="998.56" dur="5.64">the illusion that everything in the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1000.99" dur="5.43">is going perfectly that there were in a</text>
  <text start="1004.2" dur="3.81">recovery that everything in Europe has</text>
  <text start="1006.42" dur="2.85">nothing to do with the United States</text>
  <text start="1008.01" dur="3.21">they can be in a recession slash</text>
  <text start="1009.27" dur="5.19">depression they can have youth</text>
  <text start="1011.22" dur="6.15">unemployment around 60 percent the whole</text>
  <text start="1014.46" dur="6.95">eurozone could be a 12.2% countries can</text>
  <text start="1017.37" dur="7.23">be a 30 40 25 percent they can have a</text>
  <text start="1021.41" dur="4.33">debt loads that cannot be paid back but</text>
  <text start="1024.6" dur="3.57">this is nothing to do to the United</text>
  <text start="1025.74" dur="5.42">States but of course it does because we</text>
  <text start="1028.17" dur="11.1">saw the same exact scenario play out in</text>
  <text start="1031.16" dur="10.48">1929 now Obamacare is having a problem</text>
  <text start="1039.27" dur="4.86">and it has many many problems but what</text>
  <text start="1041.64" dur="4.939">they&amp;#39;re seeing now is that the signup</text>
  <text start="1044.13" dur="6.21">rate for Obamacare health insurance is</text>
  <text start="1046.579" dur="5.741">dropping off steeply in February people</text>
  <text start="1050.34" dur="4.74">are not signing up and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1052.32" dur="5.85">noticing is a lot of these policies are</text>
  <text start="1055.08" dur="4.23">not paid for and they&amp;#39;re going out and</text>
  <text start="1058.17" dur="2.7">they&amp;#39;re saying you know why aren&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="1059.31" dur="5.85">paying for your policies what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1060.87" dur="6.36">here well what they&amp;#39;re seeing is that</text>
  <text start="1065.16" dur="4.4">among those that are not paying the</text>
  <text start="1067.23" dur="6.09">reasons range from unwillingness to pay</text>
  <text start="1069.56" dur="5.5">to inability to pay some customers who</text>
  <text start="1073.32" dur="3.99">believe they can afford Obama care plans</text>
  <text start="1075.06" dur="2.489">because they are receiving tax subsidies</text>
  <text start="1077.31" dur="2.489">to</text>
  <text start="1077.549" dur="4.95">offset their premium costs are surprised</text>
  <text start="1079.799" dur="5.58">when they realize their plans came with</text>
  <text start="1082.499" dur="3.99">a relatively high deductible because of</text>
  <text start="1085.379" dur="3.601">course they&amp;#39;re getting a sub buddy</text>
  <text start="1086.489" dur="5.31">subsidies so let&amp;#39;s use an example here</text>
  <text start="1088.98" dur="5.1">let&amp;#39;s say their plan was $200 again</text>
  <text start="1091.799" dur="4.801">subsidies they&amp;#39;d like to pay $75 a month</text>
  <text start="1094.08" dur="6.809">or so but they&amp;#39;re realizing that they</text>
  <text start="1096.6" dur="6.35">have a deductible of $3,000 so when they</text>
  <text start="1100.889" dur="4.89">go to the doctor they have to lay out</text>
  <text start="1102.95" dur="5.289">$3,000 first before the insurance even</text>
  <text start="1105.779" dur="6.691">kicks in so again and I&amp;#39;ve said this in</text>
  <text start="1108.239" dur="6.69">the past Obamacare is not for the people</text>
  <text start="1112.47" dur="5.819">it is not to protect the people&amp;#39;s health</text>
  <text start="1114.929" dur="6.45">it is a cash grab taxes have been</text>
  <text start="1118.289" dur="5.49">interwoven into this system because they</text>
  <text start="1121.379" dur="4.76">need to raise revenue to pay for this</text>
  <text start="1123.779" dur="4.53">debt and they see that Obamacare is</text>
  <text start="1126.139" dur="4">struggling they&amp;#39;re not getting the</text>
  <text start="1128.309" dur="4.49">revenue they need and this is why</text>

  <text start="1650.29" dur="4.38">rid of all the ports that Russia has</text>
  <text start="1651.97" dur="6.48">along the Black Sea and this would be a</text>

  <text start="1663.61" dur="6.39">they are trying to really do this and</text>
  <text start="1666.6" dur="5.29">right now NATO is saying to Georgia that</text>
  <text start="1670" dur="7.32">the door is open you can join at any</text>

  <text start="1736.3" dur="5.61">happening once again and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1739.24" dur="4.38">happening is the instructions have been</text>

  <text start="1743.62" dur="5.91">reach Damascus from several fronts</text>
  <text start="1746.08" dur="6.69">and we can see they are preparing for a</text>
  <text start="1749.53" dur="6.57">huge event in Syria because the goal is</text>
  <text start="1752.77" dur="6.63">exactly the same they need to get into</text>
  <text start="1756.1" dur="5.22">Syria and remove Assad this is why and</text>
  <text start="1759.4" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;ve tried with all different other</text>

  <text start="1768.76" dur="5.01">humanitarian help and they are trying</text>
  <text start="1771.37" dur="3.96">many different ways to do this and</text>
  <text start="1773.77" dur="3.99">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen is</text>
  <text start="1775.33" dur="4.08">there&amp;#39;s only going to be one way there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1777.76" dur="5.19">going to have to be some type of false</text>
  <text start="1779.41" dur="5.85">flag event and then they will invade</text>
  <text start="1782.95" dur="5.4">Syria and this is going to cause other</text>
  <text start="1785.26" dur="6.18">problems because again Syria is backed</text>
  <text start="1788.35" dur="5.25">by Russia they have a pact with Iran and</text>
  <text start="1791.44" dur="6.96">this is going to cause all sorts of</text>
