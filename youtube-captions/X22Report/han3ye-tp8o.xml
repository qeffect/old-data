  <text start="64.66" dur="7.05">the Fed confirms next economic crisis</text>
  <text start="67.66" dur="7.05">massive stimulus planned let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="71.71" dur="5.85">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="74.71" dur="5.64">it does not look good up in Canada for</text>
  <text start="77.56" dur="4.08">home capital and we talked about home</text>
  <text start="80.35" dur="3.48">capital where they had to get this</text>
  <text start="81.64" dur="4.729">bailout and it looks like they received</text>
  <text start="83.83" dur="5.49">up to 2 billion dollars but guess what</text>
  <text start="86.369" dur="6.671">out of that two billion they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="89.32" dur="6.57">spent 1 billion dollars half of the</text>
  <text start="93.04" dur="5.61">emergency lifeline they only have a</text>
  <text start="95.89" dur="4.65">billion left and most likely they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="98.65" dur="4.829">going to spend that in the next week or</text>
  <text start="100.54" dur="5.07">two so when we look at what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="103.479" dur="4.651">up there it looks like things are not</text>
  <text start="105.61" dur="5.1">going to be going very very well for</text>
  <text start="108.13" dur="4.59">home capital and it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="110.71" dur="4.38">going to need something else to help</text>
  <text start="112.72" dur="5.73">them get through this because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="115.09" dur="6.559">going through all of this cash very very</text>
  <text start="118.45" dur="6.529">quickly and we need to understand that</text>
  <text start="121.649" dur="6.041">this is just the tip of the iceberg</text>
  <text start="124.979" dur="5.2">there&amp;#39;s no way that this is just</text>
  <text start="127.69" dur="4.5">isolated to one company just like they</text>
  <text start="130.179" dur="3.691">all thought Oh Bear Stearns is just</text>
  <text start="132.19" dur="4.23">isolated to Bear Stearns no other</text>
  <text start="133.87" dur="4.199">company is going to you know be involved</text>
  <text start="136.42" dur="5.54">in what is happening here and then all</text>
  <text start="138.069" dur="7.381">of a sudden we hear Lehman AIG the</text>
  <text start="141.96" dur="6.55">automobile manufacturers every bank on</text>
  <text start="145.45" dur="6.06">the block and we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="148.51" dur="5.16">just the beginning of the total</text>
  <text start="151.51" dur="5.1">destruction of the economic system</text>
  <text start="153.67" dur="5.34">because the economy right now has been</text>
  <text start="156.61" dur="6.84">built on this illusion and the illusion</text>
  <text start="159.01" dur="5.88">has been kept alive for since 1913 if</text>
  <text start="163.45" dur="4.92">you really want to think about it in</text>
  <text start="164.89" dur="5.13">those terms but lately since 2008 when</text>
  <text start="168.37" dur="4.56">the system should have just completely</text>
  <text start="170.02" dur="6.96">died they pumped up the entire system</text>
  <text start="172.93" dur="6.84">kept us in this dream state all this</text>
  <text start="176.98" dur="6.66">time to make everyone believe that the</text>
  <text start="179.77" dur="6.299">economy is fantastic and you have to</text>
  <text start="183.64" dur="3.75">remember the insiders understand and</text>
  <text start="186.069" dur="3.451">they know</text>
  <text start="187.39" dur="4.92">when the bubble has hit the top because</text>
  <text start="189.52" dur="4.68">they control everything they understand</text>
  <text start="192.31" dur="5.31">when they&amp;#39;re going to bring it down and</text>
  <text start="194.2" dur="5.4">this is why we see corporations hedge</text>
  <text start="197.62" dur="3.51">funds investment companies they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="199.6" dur="2.969">getting out of the stock market they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="201.13" dur="4.05">getting out of real estate they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="202.569" dur="4.471">getting rid of their assets right now</text>
  <text start="205.18" dur="3.9">because they understand those assets are</text>
  <text start="207.04" dur="4.32">going to fall in price and they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="209.08" dur="6.26">to be taking their profits right now and</text>
  <text start="211.36" dur="6.99">they want to sell this off to the retail</text>
  <text start="215.34" dur="5.14">investor the speculator and this is</text>
  <text start="218.35" dur="3.45">what&amp;#39;s happening right now now to keep</text>
  <text start="220.48" dur="4.59">this illusion alive they need to</text>
  <text start="221.8" dur="5.31">continually come out with fantastic data</text>
  <text start="225.07" dur="4.74">from the government and nothing&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="227.11" dur="4.95">changed since Trump has gotten has</text>
  <text start="229.81" dur="4.55">gotten into office here we can see that</text>
  <text start="232.06" dur="4.23">the payroll numbers they&amp;#39;ve come out and</text>
  <text start="234.36" dur="4.99">they&amp;#39;re telling us that everything was</text>
  <text start="236.29" dur="6.33">revised and everything just rebounded in</text>
  <text start="239.35" dur="5.58">April now this looks good for the Fed</text>
  <text start="242.62" dur="4.77">where they said hey this was just</text>
  <text start="244.93" dur="5.79">transitory this last quarter where we</text>
  <text start="247.39" dur="4.98">had 0.7% GDP and the next quarter</text>
  <text start="250.72" dur="4.29">everything&amp;#39;s going to be fantastic now</text>
  <text start="252.37" dur="4.739">like I said they have the ability to</text>
  <text start="255.01" dur="4.56">manipulate everything to make it look</text>
  <text start="257.109" dur="4.711">fantastic all they have to do is revise</text>
  <text start="259.57" dur="4.29">all they have to do is lead people out</text>
  <text start="261.82" dur="4.409">of the job market all they have to do is</text>
  <text start="263.86" dur="4.92">export soybeans they can do whatever</text>
  <text start="266.229" dur="5.581">they have to do to keep the economy</text>
  <text start="268.78" dur="4.71">looking like it is fantastic and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="271.81" dur="4.47">June meeting is coming up and we know</text>
  <text start="273.49" dur="4.89">this is the in-between period of when</text>
  <text start="276.28" dur="4.47">the GDP numbers are being released and</text>
  <text start="278.38" dur="5.18">most likely because they have to stay on</text>
  <text start="280.75" dur="5.82">track they will raise the interest rates</text>
  <text start="283.56" dur="4.9">now the unemployment rate it has come</text>
  <text start="286.57" dur="4.92">down to what four point four percent</text>
  <text start="288.46" dur="8.76">right now this is the lowest level since</text>
  <text start="291.49" dur="9.27">May of 2007 now we&amp;#39;re hitting that point</text>
  <text start="297.22" dur="7.08">in time where the unemployment rate was</text>
  <text start="300.76" dur="5.58">almost exactly where it was before the</text>
  <text start="304.3" dur="4.98">economy completely crashed now this</text>
  <text start="306.34" dur="5.13">unemployment rate is completely</text>
  <text start="309.28" dur="3.78">manipulated most of the people have</text>
  <text start="311.47" dur="2.55">fallen off the job market those people</text>
  <text start="313.06" dur="2.46">who haven&amp;#39;t been on an interview for</text>
  <text start="314.02" dur="4.37">four weeks well guess what they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="315.52" dur="5.55">not counted and think about it we just</text>
  <text start="318.39" dur="5.32">had the announcement that</text>
  <text start="321.07" dur="5.1">there are 3,500 stores that are going to</text>
  <text start="323.71" dur="5.4">closed in the first quarter of 2017 and</text>
  <text start="326.17" dur="6.06">they calculated it out to about eight</text>
  <text start="329.11" dur="5.97">thousand six hundred plus stores for</text>
  <text start="332.23" dur="6.14">this year and corporations they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="335.08" dur="8.85">making profits they&amp;#39;re laying off people</text>
  <text start="338.37" dur="8.68">so are these numbers real no they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="343.93" dur="5.7">it&amp;#39;s all on how you play with the</text>
  <text start="347.05" dur="4.86">numbers to make it look like we are at</text>
  <text start="349.63" dur="5.43">full employment and we know that we are</text>
  <text start="351.91" dur="5.07">not if you look at shadow stats and you</text>
  <text start="355.06" dur="5.76">look at the calculation they used prior</text>
  <text start="356.98" dur="6.84">to 2008 I think is going back to 1990</text>
  <text start="360.82" dur="4.71">the unemployment rate is close to twenty</text>
  <text start="363.82" dur="3.9">to twenty three percent and if you</text>
  <text start="365.53" dur="5.37">calculate all those part-time jobs into</text>
  <text start="367.72" dur="5.1">this I mean the unemployment rate is</text>
  <text start="370.9" dur="4.29">most likely around thirty percent right</text>
  <text start="372.82" dur="3.99">now because you have to remember those</text>
  <text start="375.19" dur="3.12">part-time jobs they&amp;#39;re counted as a</text>
  <text start="376.81" dur="4.11">full-time job but when they lose them</text>
  <text start="378.31" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re not counted as a loss of a</text>
  <text start="380.92" dur="3.36">full-time job because they have to meet</text>
  <text start="382.69" dur="4.11">certain requirements you know the hours</text>
  <text start="384.28" dur="5.04">and the pay and this is varies by state</text>
  <text start="386.8" dur="5.04">by state but we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="389.32" dur="4.44">is completely manipulated now the</text>
  <text start="391.84" dur="5.79">central bankers their whole objective is</text>
  <text start="393.76" dur="7.44">to continually increase the debt blow</text>
  <text start="397.63" dur="6.54">the bubble up as big as you possibly can</text>
  <text start="401.2" dur="5.43">and we can see already that many</text>
  <text start="404.17" dur="4.32">individuals well they&amp;#39;re using their</text>
  <text start="406.63" dur="3.96">credit cards just to make ends meet</text>
  <text start="408.49" dur="5.4">because they don&amp;#39;t have the cash to get</text>
  <text start="410.59" dur="5.64">the food to pay for goods and we see</text>
  <text start="413.89" dur="5.7">right now that student loans and auto</text>
  <text start="416.23" dur="7.92">loans they have hit an all-time high of</text>
  <text start="419.59" dur="8.22">two point six trillion dollars I mean</text>
  <text start="424.15" dur="5.13">this is just unbelievable and we see</text>
  <text start="427.81" dur="3.99">right now that there was an increase of</text>
  <text start="429.28" dur="4.64">student loans of 32 billion for the</text>
  <text start="431.8" dur="5.31">quarter and eighty billion for the year</text>
  <text start="433.92" dur="5.77">which brought student loan total amount</text>
  <text start="437.11" dur="5.1">up to one point four four trillion now</text>
  <text start="439.69" dur="5.04">on the auto loan side what are we seeing</text>
  <text start="442.21" dur="6.54">well we saw an increase of eight billion</text>
  <text start="444.73" dur="8.31">for the quarter and we see 73 billion</text>
  <text start="448.75" dur="6.12">for the year this means right now that</text>
  <text start="453.04" dur="4.26">auto loans has</text>
  <text start="454.87" dur="5.18">gone up to about one point one two</text>
  <text start="457.3" dur="6.33">trillion combine those two together</text>
  <text start="460.05" dur="9.07">we&amp;#39;re looking at two point five six</text>
  <text start="463.63" dur="9.39">trillion dollars that is a lot of debt</text>
  <text start="469.12" dur="5.91">and again the only way the central bank</text>
  <text start="473.02" dur="5.61">works and works well is if it</text>
  <text start="475.03" dur="6.57">continually spreads debt to other</text>
  <text start="478.63" dur="6.27">countries to individuals and they need</text>
  <text start="481.6" dur="5.25">to continually do this now it looks like</text>
  <text start="484.9" dur="4.8">the New York Fed and the Atlanta Fed</text>
  <text start="486.85" dur="4.05">well they&amp;#39;re looking at new second</text>
  <text start="489.7" dur="3.45">quarter GDP numbers and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="490.9" dur="4.8">estimating right now and this time they</text>
  <text start="493.15" dur="5.19">flip-flop where the Atlanta Fed had a</text>
  <text start="495.7" dur="5.79">very low GDP number and New York Fed had</text>
  <text start="498.34" dur="5.28">a very high GDP number and they included</text>
  <text start="501.49" dur="5.34">the soft data when they were calculating</text>
  <text start="503.62" dur="5.28">that out the Atlanta Fed right now has</text>
  <text start="506.83" dur="4.8">once again started off very strong</text>
  <text start="508.9" dur="7.44">they&amp;#39;re expecting four point three</text>
  <text start="511.63" dur="6.3">percent GDP now they started off that</text>
  <text start="516.34" dur="3.9">way but they lowered it to four point</text>
  <text start="517.93" dur="5.04">two percent and we know that this number</text>
  <text start="520.24" dur="4.31">is never going to be reached I mean</text>
  <text start="522.97" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re going to have to do a huge</text>
  <text start="524.55" dur="5.71">manipulated calculation to get it to</text>
  <text start="527.92" dur="5.13">where they want it now the New York Fed</text>
  <text start="530.26" dur="5.7">on the other hand well they started at</text>
  <text start="533.05" dur="5.49">two point three percent and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="535.96" dur="4.17">down to one point eight percent now</text>
  <text start="538.54" dur="3.96">think about this the first quarter is</text>
  <text start="540.13" dur="3.96">that point seven percent do you really</text>
  <text start="542.5" dur="3.15">think that we&amp;#39;re going to be above three</text>
  <text start="544.09" dur="2.67">percent actually do you really think</text>
  <text start="545.65" dur="2.55">we&amp;#39;re gonna be above two percent the</text>
  <text start="546.76" dur="4.83">only way we can get above two percent is</text>
  <text start="548.2" dur="5.25">if they manipulate it like they did</text>
  <text start="551.59" dur="3.84">right before the elections where all of</text>
  <text start="553.45" dur="3.69">a sudden they exported soybeans which</text>
  <text start="555.43" dur="2.85">was a one-off thing and they brought it</text>
  <text start="557.14" dur="3.18">up to like two point eight two point</text>
  <text start="558.28" dur="3.3">nine percent that&amp;#39;s the only way they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="560.32" dur="2.76">going to get to that area but the Fed</text>
  <text start="561.58" dur="4.77">doesn&amp;#39;t care about that right now</text>
  <text start="563.08" dur="5.13">because they meet in June and they will</text>
  <text start="566.35" dur="4.11">look at the numbers that we just have</text>
  <text start="568.21" dur="4.02">seen right now and other numbers that</text>
  <text start="570.46" dur="4.02">are going to be coming out and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="572.23" dur="4.32">say low well the Atlanta Fed and the New</text>
  <text start="574.48" dur="4.5">York said they&amp;#39;re telling us that GDP is</text>
  <text start="576.55" dur="5.04">pretty good the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="578.98" dur="4.41">look good and guess what we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="581.59" dur="4.2">raise the rates because everyone is</text>
  <text start="583.39" dur="4.77">going to forget about what happened in</text>
  <text start="585.79" dur="2.97">the first quarter and the Fed said it</text>
  <text start="588.16" dur="3.78">was transit</text>
  <text start="588.76" dur="5.009">anyhow the reason why they need to do</text>
  <text start="591.94" dur="5.009">this is because they are on track to</text>
  <text start="593.769" dur="5.551">bring this economy down this is their</text>
  <text start="596.949" dur="4.291">whole plan and by raising the rates a</text>
  <text start="599.32" dur="4.379">little bit at a time they&amp;#39;re waiting for</text>
  <text start="601.24" dur="4.83">the trigger where the economy starts to</text>
  <text start="603.699" dur="4.14">really fall apart and once it starts</text>
  <text start="606.07" dur="3.93">falling apart it&amp;#39;s like a snowball</text>
  <text start="607.839" dur="4.231">coming down the hill a gain speeds gets</text>
  <text start="610" dur="4.38">on more snow and as it comes down the</text>
  <text start="612.07" dur="3.99">hill you won&amp;#39;t be able to stop it and</text>
  <text start="614.38" dur="3.3">this is what they want to happen and</text>
  <text start="616.06" dur="3.3">once that starts to happen they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="617.68" dur="4.23">to start reversing the interest rates</text>
  <text start="619.36" dur="7.289">just like they did prior to 2008 now we</text>
  <text start="621.91" dur="10.64">are getting indications that the credit</text>
  <text start="626.649" dur="9.151">event in China well things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="632.55" dur="6.58">collapsing we&amp;#39;re seeing red flags right</text>
  <text start="635.8" dur="6.42">now and if we listen to Bill halter when</text>
  <text start="639.13" dur="5.069">I had him on many different times when</text>
  <text start="642.22" dur="3.929">we talked about the credit market he</text>
  <text start="644.199" dur="5.101">said the credit market is eventually</text>
  <text start="646.149" dur="5.911">going to freeze up and we know from UBS</text>
  <text start="649.3" dur="5.219">we had the credit warning where it</text>
  <text start="652.06" dur="4.74">dropped below zero which tells us that</text>
  <text start="654.519" dur="5.76">something is wrong here and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="656.8" dur="5.279">starting to see signs that the credit</text>
  <text start="660.279" dur="5.31">problem in China</text>
  <text start="662.079" dur="6.24">well we are seeing different signs that</text>
  <text start="665.589" dur="5.73">were headed down this path where things</text>
  <text start="668.319" dur="5.671">are going to rapidly deteriorate and it</text>
  <text start="671.319" dur="6.121">does not look good whatsoever what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="673.99" dur="6">seeing is the interbank rate in China</text>
  <text start="677.44" dur="4.92">while they&amp;#39;re spiking meaning banks</text>
  <text start="679.99" dur="6.649">increasingly don&amp;#39;t trust each other and</text>

  <text start="876.45" dur="4.47">why they&amp;#39;re raising the interest rates</text>
  <text start="877.89" dur="6.48">right now they want to trigger the</text>
  <text start="880.92" dur="6.48">crisis this way when they trigger it</text>
  <text start="884.37" dur="4.08">they can blame it on anybody because</text>
  <text start="887.4" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re raising the</text>
  <text start="888.45" dur="3.81">interest rates everything is fine it was</text>
  <text start="890.61" dur="3.54">because of Trump&amp;#39;s policies it was</text>
  <text start="892.26" dur="4.59">because of this country it was because</text>
  <text start="894.15" dur="6.51">of them over there this is the way the</text>
  <text start="896.85" dur="7.35">central banks work and we can see right</text>
  <text start="900.66" dur="5.13">now as June approaches we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="904.2" dur="3.72">have to look at this very very carefully</text>
  <text start="905.79" dur="5.49">because if they raise the rates in June</text>
  <text start="907.92" dur="5.58">it means we are perfectly on track for</text>
  <text start="911.28" dur="3.72">this system to come down maybe by the</text>
  <text start="913.5" dur="4.32">end of this year or the beginning of</text>
  <text start="915" dur="6.27">2018 depending on how many more times</text>
  <text start="917.82" dur="5.04">they raise their rates because I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="921.27" dur="4.29">think it&amp;#39;s going to take that many times</text>
  <text start="922.86" dur="4.68">for something to get triggered and the</text>
  <text start="925.56" dur="4.05">whole thing start to fall apart because</text>
  <text start="927.54" dur="5.4">the economy has been built up on an</text>
  <text start="929.61" dur="5.13">illusion and from everything that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="932.94" dur="4.53">been looking at from going back in time</text>
  <text start="934.74" dur="5.34">from all the economic data we can see</text>
  <text start="937.47" dur="5.7">that this economy is not what they are</text>
  <text start="940.08" dur="4.71">saying it is just like back in 2008 when</text>
  <text start="943.17" dur="3.69">they told us the surprise securities</text>
  <text start="944.79" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;ve refined triple-a the economy</text>
  <text start="946.86" dur="5.43">strong then we come to find out after</text>
  <text start="949.44" dur="4.56">the crash that it was all a lie what</text>
  <text start="952.29" dur="5.37">we&amp;#39;re going to have the same type of</text>
  <text start="954" dur="5.85">thing happen once the crash happens the</text>
  <text start="957.66" dur="4.23">truth lend will come out but of course</text>
  <text start="959.85" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s too late you can&amp;#39;t start preparing</text>
  <text start="961.89" dur="3.06">you can&amp;#39;t start getting food you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="963.99" dur="2.52">start getting water</text>
  <text start="964.95" dur="4.17">you can&amp;#39;t start getting gold you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="966.51" dur="5.34">take your cash out of the bank you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="969.12" dur="6.12">do any of these things because once the</text>
  <text start="971.85" dur="5.37">system breaks down it&amp;#39;s too late you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="975.24" dur="6.83">going to be scrambling like everybody</text>
  <text start="977.22" dur="7.76">else think about go back in time to 2008</text>
  <text start="982.07" dur="5.35">after everything started to fall apart</text>
  <text start="984.98" dur="4.69">were you able to do anything at that</text>
  <text start="987.42" dur="5.85">point especially those individuals that</text>
  <text start="989.67" dur="6.24">lost their pension lost their money in</text>
  <text start="993.27" dur="6.18">the stock market lost the homes they</text>
  <text start="995.91" dur="6.9">owned what were you able to do nothing</text>
  <text start="999.45" dur="6.57">and this time this time around it&amp;#39;s</text>
