  <text start="133.73" dur="5.009">already told the government what they</text>
  <text start="135.739" dur="4.421">wanted the government needs to follow</text>
  <text start="138.739" dur="3.731">through</text>
  <text start="140.16" dur="6.12">we&amp;#39;re going to see this happen not just</text>
  <text start="142.47" dur="7.77">in the UK but all around the world and</text>
  <text start="146.28" dur="7.89">it is just beginning now Trump he has</text>
  <text start="150.24" dur="7.35">departed and he&amp;#39;s left for the g20</text>
  <text start="154.17" dur="7.02">summit in Osaka Japan each we need help</text>

  <text start="161.19" dur="5.37">and Osaka Japan</text>
  <text start="163.08" dur="6.84">and we can see that he&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="166.56" dur="7.23">prepared and ready to deal with Asian</text>
  <text start="169.92" dur="7.59">ping to bring this deal full circle now</text>
  <text start="173.79" dur="6.18">yes China has a lot of issues the US has</text>
  <text start="177.51" dur="4.95">a lot of issues but I do believe that</text>
  <text start="179.97" dur="5.16">everything has been laid out and the</text>
  <text start="182.46" dur="5.46">plan has been set where they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="185.13" dur="5.61">come together and basically announce</text>
  <text start="187.92" dur="5.94">that there is a framework to this entire</text>
  <text start="190.74" dur="5.76">deal and I think this is going to happen</text>
  <text start="193.86" dur="4.89">is it going to happen at the g20 it</text>
  <text start="196.5" dur="4.59">might or it might happen a little bit</text>
  <text start="198.75" dur="4.25">after this we&amp;#39;ll have to see how Trump</text>
  <text start="201.09" dur="4.77">plays this out but we can see that</text>
  <text start="203" dur="7.3">everybody is in position and I believe</text>
  <text start="205.86" dur="7.35">that it might even happen after the g20</text>
  <text start="210.3" dur="6.9">meeting because Trump he is scheduled to</text>
  <text start="213.21" dur="6.72">fly down to South Korea and he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="217.2" dur="5.16">to meet with moon Jay so he might meet</text>
  <text start="219.93" dur="5.31">with moon Jay and then make this</text>
  <text start="222.36" dur="5.55">announcement but he might say in the g20</text>
  <text start="225.24" dur="4.8">meeting that everything went well that</text>
  <text start="227.91" dur="5.97">we&amp;#39;re working on the deal and I do</text>
  <text start="230.04" dur="6.93">believe that there is a deal coming now</text>
  <text start="233.88" dur="5.3">let&amp;#39;s talk about the strategy of Trump</text>
  <text start="236.97" dur="4.71">with the Federal Reserve with</text>
  <text start="239.18" dur="6.01">transitioning us from a central bank</text>
  <text start="241.68" dur="5.94">economy into a people&amp;#39;s economy think</text>
  <text start="245.19" dur="5.01">about what he&amp;#39;s been doing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="247.62" dur="5.16">continually out there tweeting telling</text>
  <text start="250.2" dur="5.07">everyone the Fed is making big mistakes</text>
  <text start="252.78" dur="3.03">if they did this we would have a better</text>
  <text start="255.27" dur="2.61">economy</text>
  <text start="255.81" dur="4.11">if they did this we would have a better</text>
  <text start="257.88" dur="4.109">stock market if they did this more</text>
  <text start="259.92" dur="4.47">people would be employed but they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="261.989" dur="4.591">they&amp;#39;re doing this and look the stock</text>
  <text start="264.39" dur="4.44">market is not as high as it should be</text>
  <text start="266.58" dur="4.97">it&amp;#39;s actually declining sometimes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="268.83" dur="4.55">going up the GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="271.55" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re not that great because the Fed</text>
  <text start="273.38" dur="3.78">is not doing what they&amp;#39;re supposed to be</text>
  <text start="275.45" dur="4.08">doing actually the Fed has no idea what</text>
  <text start="277.16" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re doing every time</text>
  <text start="279.53" dur="7.17">Trump continually says these things what</text>
  <text start="283.1" dur="7.44">is he doing he&amp;#39;s pointing the finger at</text>
  <text start="286.7" dur="6.72">the Fed but more importantly the Fed is</text>
  <text start="290.54" dur="7.58">losing credibility it&amp;#39;s losing its</text>
  <text start="293.42" dur="8.19">integrity and this is on purpose and</text>
  <text start="298.12" dur="7.03">it&amp;#39;s a gradual process to bring the</text>
  <text start="301.61" dur="6.6">people into the fold now the mainstream</text>
  <text start="305.15" dur="5.19">media they&amp;#39;re trying to soften the blow</text>
  <text start="308.21" dur="4.11">of what Trump is trying to do we know</text>
  <text start="310.34" dur="4.89">that Trump has told the Fed we need to</text>
  <text start="312.32" dur="5.49">cut rates we know Trump has told the Fed</text>
  <text start="315.23" dur="5.52">listen we need to start stimulus this is</text>
  <text start="317.81" dur="6.84">coming out of CNBC and the headline is a</text>
  <text start="320.75" dur="7.55">Fed let down on rate cuts could be the</text>
  <text start="324.65" dur="5.67">stock market&amp;#39;s biggest threat now now</text>
  <text start="328.3" dur="5.86">they&amp;#39;re trying to put out there and</text>
  <text start="330.32" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re trying to project that yeah the</text>
  <text start="334.16" dur="4.35">Fed is not going to do anything or it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="336.26" dur="4.14">going to be so small that the stock</text>
  <text start="338.51" dur="4.71">market was expecting something much much</text>
  <text start="340.4" dur="7.59">larger but as soon as the Fed cuts rates</text>
  <text start="343.22" dur="7.74">the market is going to go up Trump knows</text>
  <text start="347.99" dur="7.8">this the Patriots know this and once</text>
  <text start="350.96" dur="6.78">they start stimulus well it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="355.79" dur="3.81">to be incredible now does this mean the</text>
  <text start="357.74" dur="4.29">economy&amp;#39;s doing great does this mean</text>
  <text start="359.6" dur="6.06">that everything is solved now all he is</text>
  <text start="362.03" dur="7.23">doing is he&amp;#39;s taking this central bank</text>
  <text start="365.66" dur="6.54">system which is completely at its end</text>
  <text start="369.26" dur="4.05">stage and he&amp;#39;s just keeping it going a</text>
  <text start="372.2" dur="3.33">little bit longer</text>
  <text start="373.31" dur="3.72">now of course CNBC is out there trying</text>
  <text start="375.53" dur="3.66">to say that you know it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="377.03" dur="3.66">be that great the stock market&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="379.19" dur="3.33">not going to go up it might even decline</text>
  <text start="380.69" dur="4.11">because they&amp;#39;re trying to make their</text>
  <text start="382.52" dur="3.93">case that you know but the economy is</text>
  <text start="384.8" dur="3.38">not going to be that great in 2020 and</text>
  <text start="386.45" dur="4.58">we know</text>
  <text start="388.18" dur="7.079">that this is Trump&amp;#39;s plan part of the</text>
  <text start="391.03" dur="6.66">plan to get the economy pretty stable</text>
  <text start="395.259" dur="3.211">for the 2020 elections that make it look</text>
  <text start="397.69" dur="3.599">fantastic</text>
  <text start="398.47" dur="6.96">this way he controls the narrative now</text>
  <text start="401.289" dur="7.281">Trump has not stopped hitting at the Fed</text>
  <text start="405.43" dur="5.94">we know he tweeted out on Monday and he</text>
  <text start="408.57" dur="8.08">hit the Fed told us what the plan was</text>
  <text start="411.37" dur="6.54">and Trump took another shot at the Fed</text>
  <text start="416.65" dur="3.66">once again and this was during the</text>
  <text start="417.91" dur="3.77">interview with Fox Business Network host</text>
  <text start="420.31" dur="4.47">Maria Bartiromo</text>
  <text start="421.68" dur="6.22">he said we&amp;#39;re taking money out and</text>
  <text start="424.78" dur="5.31">raising interest rates it&amp;#39;s insane</text>
  <text start="427.9" dur="4.38">he never should have raised interest</text>
  <text start="430.09" dur="5.04">rates to the extent that he did if he</text>
  <text start="432.28" dur="4.65">would have raised them just half and if</text>
  <text start="435.13" dur="4.62">he would have not done the quantitative</text>
  <text start="436.93" dur="5.81">tightening our market would have been up</text>
  <text start="439.75" dur="6.09">another 10,000 points and I&amp;#39;ll tell you</text>
  <text start="442.74" dur="6.01">GDP would have been up another point or</text>
  <text start="445.84" dur="5.85">two points here&amp;#39;s a guy nobody ever</text>
  <text start="448.75" dur="4.949">heard of him before and now I made him</text>
  <text start="451.69" dur="5.52">and he wants to show how tough he is</text>
  <text start="453.699" dur="8.301">okay let him show how tough he is he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="457.21" dur="8.6">he&amp;#39;s a he&amp;#39;s not doing a good job so</text>
  <text start="462" dur="7.87">Trump right there is telling the world</text>
  <text start="465.81" dur="9.22">telling everyone in this country that</text>
  <text start="469.87" dur="10.889">the Fed is not doing a good job this is</text>
  <text start="475.03" dur="8.25">going exactly as planned and he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="480.759" dur="6.66">going to stop this he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="483.28" dur="7.62">continually hit the Fed and hit it hard</text>
  <text start="487.419" dur="4.941">and this is going to accelerate as we</text>
  <text start="490.9" dur="5.449">move forward</text>
  <text start="492.36" dur="7.559">why because the central bank system does</text>
  <text start="496.349" dur="5.79">not work the central bank system is at</text>
  <text start="499.919" dur="6.661">its end stage think about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="502.139" dur="7.08">happening now Trump and G they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="506.58" dur="7.949">to come together they&amp;#39;re going to create</text>
  <text start="509.219" dur="10.171">this incredible trade deal once they do</text>
  <text start="514.529" dur="6.3">this Trump is going to remove tariffs</text>
  <text start="519.39" dur="5.009">now is this going to happen right away</text>
  <text start="520.829" dur="9.331">no will happen maybe in the beginning of</text>
  <text start="524.399" dur="9.151">2020 maybe once Trump does this the Fed</text>
  <text start="530.16" dur="7.55">is then out in the open</text>
  <text start="533.55" dur="6.77">they have nothing to hide behind because</text>
  <text start="537.71" dur="5.89">what is the central bank owned to say</text>
  <text start="540.32" dur="6.52">well the US economy&amp;#39;s doing fantastic</text>
  <text start="543.6" dur="5.4">and this is why the world is slowing we</text>
  <text start="546.84" dur="4.38">made great trade deals this is why the</text>
  <text start="549" dur="4.8">world is slowing tariffs are removed</text>
  <text start="551.22" dur="4.88">this is why the world is slowing No</text>
  <text start="553.8" dur="5.91">everything is going to a point to them</text>
  <text start="556.1" dur="6.52">the reason the world is slowing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="559.71" dur="6.03">because of the central bank Trump is</text>
  <text start="562.62" dur="7.98">going to start mentioning this letting</text>
  <text start="565.74" dur="7.2">them know that this is why the world is</text>
  <text start="570.6" dur="5.04">long because not just the Fed but</text>
  <text start="572.94" dur="5.43">central bank&amp;#39;s the private western</text>
  <text start="575.64" dur="6.78">central banks they don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="578.37" dur="5.83">they&amp;#39;re doing and the system is falling</text>
  <text start="582.42" dur="5.77">apart</text>
  <text start="584.2" dur="6.42">and we are at the beginning stage of all</text>
  <text start="588.19" dur="5.34">of this we&amp;#39;re watching all of this</text>
  <text start="590.62" dur="5.07">unfold in real time yes in the future</text>
  <text start="593.53" dur="5.19">you will go back in time and it will</text>
  <text start="595.69" dur="4.95">look clear as day of what Trump and the</text>
  <text start="598.72" dur="4.53">Patriots have done and you&amp;#39;ll be able to</text>
  <text start="600.64" dur="4.17">see it that the central bank system was</text>
  <text start="603.25" dur="4.08">a terrible system there&amp;#39;ll be books</text>
  <text start="604.81" dur="5.37">written about this the kids will be</text>
  <text start="607.33" dur="6.24">taught in school that the central bank</text>
  <text start="610.18" dur="5.91">system is a system which corrupts</text>
  <text start="613.57" dur="10.11">government which puts countries into</text>
  <text start="616.09" dur="11.75">debt which is bad for the people and the</text>
  <text start="623.68" dur="7.5">kids will then know to never let another</text>
  <text start="627.84" dur="6.97">central bank back into this country or</text>
  <text start="631.18" dur="10.41">any other country because they will try</text>
  <text start="634.81" dur="9.57">to control the world through debt</text>
  <text start="641.59" dur="4.14">and of course what&amp;#39;s going to happen and</text>
  <text start="644.38" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;ve known this from the founding</text>
  <text start="645.73" dur="6.51">fathers is that the central bank will</text>
  <text start="649.69" dur="5.73">try to worm their way back into the</text>
  <text start="652.24" dur="5.16">system and they&amp;#39;ll try over and over and</text>
  <text start="655.42" dur="4.14">over think back in time</text>
  <text start="657.4" dur="4.01">how many central banks were here in the</text>
  <text start="659.56" dur="4.11">United States this is the third one</text>
  <text start="661.41" dur="5.38">central bank of America one central</text>
  <text start="663.67" dur="5.01">America - and now we have the Federal</text>
  <text start="666.79" dur="4.74">Reserve they changed the name and the</text>
  <text start="668.68" dur="5.28">central bank they will always try to get</text>
  <text start="671.53" dur="6.93">back into each in every country and</text>
  <text start="673.96" dur="7.83">they&amp;#39;ll try to corrupt politicians to do</text>
  <text start="678.46" dur="5.61">it they will promise them money they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="681.79" dur="6.4">promise and promise them anything that</text>
  <text start="684.07" dur="7.21">they want to get back into the system</text>
  <text start="688.19" dur="5.03">and maybe they will but it&amp;#39;ll be a very</text>
  <text start="691.28" dur="5.37">long time until they do it again and</text>
  <text start="693.22" dur="5.23">just like the founding fathers future</text>
  <text start="696.65" dur="5.16">generations most likely will have to</text>
  <text start="698.45" dur="6.26">fight this once again this has happened</text>
  <text start="701.81" dur="6.39">over and over and over in history and</text>
  <text start="704.71" dur="6.04">this is why Trump continually says this</text>
  <text start="708.2" dur="5.64">can never happen to another president</text>
  <text start="710.75" dur="5.07">again that&amp;#39;s what spine he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="713.84" dur="5.31">say this could never happen to another</text>
  <text start="715.82" dur="5.43">country again this can never happen to</text>
  <text start="719.15" dur="4.95">the United States again letting a</text>
  <text start="721.25" dur="5.56">central bank into the into the country</text>
  <text start="724.1" dur="7.32">allowing them to control</text>
  <text start="726.81" dur="7.29">our system and we are on our way</text>
