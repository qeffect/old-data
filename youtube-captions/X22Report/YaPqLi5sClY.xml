  <text start="56.269" dur="5.34">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="57.769" dur="7.771">episode 1397 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="61.609" dur="6.811">October 10th 2017 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="65.54" dur="5.04">episode is d dollarization continues</text>
  <text start="68.42" dur="4.89">more countries pivot away from the</text>
  <text start="70.58" dur="5.1">dollar let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="73.31" dur="4.8">collapse financial news now at this</text>
  <text start="75.68" dur="4.29">point we realize that the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="78.11" dur="4.95">they want complete control the</text>
  <text start="79.97" dur="4.8">cryptocurrency market and we also know</text>
  <text start="83.06" dur="4.349">that the cryptocurrency market it is a</text>
  <text start="84.77" dur="4.68">decentralized system but we do know that</text>
  <text start="87.409" dur="4.35">UBS the central banks and many other</text>
  <text start="89.45" dur="4.589">banks were all together creating their</text>
  <text start="91.759" dur="3.72">own type of system where they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="94.039" dur="3.69">tell the public listen instead of having</text>
  <text start="95.479" dur="4.261">all this volatility we will make sure</text>
  <text start="97.729" dur="3.511">that everything stays stable now of</text>
  <text start="99.74" dur="3.659">course the volatility means that it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="101.24" dur="3.989">free open market and this is what it</text>
  <text start="103.399" dur="4.351">really looks like compared to the stock</text>
  <text start="105.229" dur="3.961">market which is completely manipulated</text>
  <text start="107.75" dur="4.259">but we can see there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="109.19" dur="6.539">countries out there that do not want an</text>
  <text start="112.009" dur="5.34">open and free market and we can see that</text>
  <text start="115.729" dur="2.941">there are certain government&amp;#39;s here in</text>
  <text start="117.349" dur="3.091">the United States where they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="118.67" dur="4.14">to put restrictions we know China has</text>
  <text start="120.44" dur="4.17">been putting restrictions Russia wants</text>
  <text start="122.81" dur="6.449">to put restrictions and they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="124.61" dur="8.28">this to control the entire system now</text>
  <text start="129.259" dur="6.601">remember the central banking system does</text>
  <text start="132.89" dur="5.7">not have any allegiance to any country</text>
  <text start="135.86" dur="5.07">to any group their allegiance is to</text>
  <text start="138.59" dur="4.5">currency they&amp;#39;re creating currency out</text>
  <text start="140.93" dur="3.99">of thin air their allegiance is to debt</text>
  <text start="143.09" dur="2.94">and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="144.92" dur="3.989">located it makes no difference</text>
  <text start="146.03" dur="4.789">whatsoever and we can see that certain</text>
  <text start="148.909" dur="5.011">governments they&amp;#39;re very afraid of</text>
  <text start="150.819" dur="5.861">crypto currencies Russia is very nervous</text>
  <text start="153.92" dur="4.62">about China is very nervous about it the</text>
  <text start="156.68" dur="4.41">United States is very nervous about it</text>
  <text start="158.54" dur="4.619">because they want to control the system</text>
  <text start="161.09" dur="3.929">now of course you have the central banks</text>
  <text start="163.159" dur="3.601">that sit on top of all this where</text>
  <text start="165.019" dur="4.561">they&amp;#39;re the ones who are creating the</text>
  <text start="166.76" dur="5.67">currencies for most of these countries</text>
  <text start="169.58" dur="4.14">just like the EU we have them creating</text>
  <text start="172.43" dur="4.86">the currency for most of the countries</text>
  <text start="173.72" dur="5.64">within the EU and we see right now there</text>
  <text start="177.29" dur="3.48">are many countries that are going to try</text>
  <text start="179.36" dur="4.14">to stop this Russia for instance their</text>
  <text start="180.77" dur="4.11">central bank they said that listen</text>
  <text start="183.5" dur="2.459">they&amp;#39;re going to support efforts to</text>
  <text start="184.88" dur="3.589">block access</text>
  <text start="185.959" dur="6.23">to external websites selling</text>
  <text start="188.469" dur="6.52">cryptocurrencies in the country and</text>
  <text start="192.189" dur="6.101">remember the crypto market is completely</text>
  <text start="194.989" dur="5.58">decentralized and there&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very very</text>
  <text start="198.29" dur="4.58">difficult to control except when the</text>
  <text start="200.569" dur="4.741">central bank&amp;#39;s create their own crypto</text>
  <text start="202.87" dur="3.61">currency and they tell everyone this is</text>
  <text start="205.31" dur="3.659">the currency that you should be using</text>
  <text start="206.48" dur="4.619">but the really free and open crypto</text>
  <text start="208.969" dur="4.261">currency it is kept on many many servers</text>
  <text start="211.099" dur="3.901">it&amp;#39;s very very difficult to control and</text>
  <text start="213.23" dur="4.67">we can see that they&amp;#39;re doing whatever</text>
  <text start="215" dur="6.81">they possibly can to control the system</text>
  <text start="217.9" dur="8.11">now out in London we see that the</text>
  <text start="221.81" dur="6.48">housing prices they are falling and they</text>
  <text start="226.01" dur="5.25">have fallen in September the first time</text>

  <text start="233.54" dur="7.289">house sales are now down by over a very</text>
  <text start="237.019" dur="7.44">large 1/3 and we can see right now the</text>
  <text start="240.829" dur="7.261">bubbles are starting to pop in certain</text>
  <text start="244.459" dur="6.21">areas and again most of the people in</text>
  <text start="248.09" dur="3.69">these countries they are the not they</text>
  <text start="250.669" dur="3.57">are not the ones who are actually</text>
  <text start="251.78" dur="3.75">purchasing the homes its investment</text>
  <text start="254.239" dur="3.21">companies of hedge funds foreign</text>
  <text start="255.53" dur="3.81">investors you name it they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="257.449" dur="3.84">it and we&amp;#39;re not just seeing it out in</text>
  <text start="259.34" dur="3.9">London we&amp;#39;re seeing in Canada we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="261.289" dur="3.69">seeing in Australia we&amp;#39;re seeing it</text>
  <text start="263.24" dur="4.709">throughout Europe we&amp;#39;re seeing it even</text>
  <text start="264.979" dur="4.141">here in the in the United States now</text>
  <text start="267.949" dur="4.291">we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the real estate</text>
  <text start="269.12" dur="6.63">market quite closely and out in New York</text>
  <text start="272.24" dur="5.82">we see something very very interesting</text>
  <text start="275.75" dur="4.169">that commercial real estate market New</text>
  <text start="278.06" dur="4.979">York&amp;#39;s New York City is collapsing at</text>
  <text start="279.919" dur="5.641">the same time that residential</text>
  <text start="283.039" dur="7.011">foreclosures are surging to levels not</text>
  <text start="285.56" dur="7.71">seen since 2009 now think about this</text>
  <text start="290.05" dur="6">foreclosures of residential homes are</text>
  <text start="293.27" dur="5.79">skyrocketing they&amp;#39;re surging right now</text>
  <text start="296.05" dur="5.32">now property shark points out today</text>
  <text start="299.06" dur="4.859">foreclosures across New York City surged</text>
  <text start="301.37" dur="6.75">by 79 percent year-on-year in the third</text>
  <text start="303.919" dur="6.111">quarter of 2017 to 859 and remain at the</text>
  <text start="308.12" dur="6.12">highest level since the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="310.03" dur="5.47">all five boroughs registered increases</text>
  <text start="314.24" dur="4.32">in the number of homes scheduled for</text>
  <text start="315.5" dur="4.01">auction so what we&amp;#39;re looking at right</text>
  <text start="318.56" dur="4.64">now is</text>
  <text start="319.51" dur="5.52">the beginning of a housing collapse now</text>
  <text start="323.2" dur="3.84">we&amp;#39;ve been noticing this out in</text>
  <text start="325.03" dur="3.75">California we&amp;#39;ve been seeing this out in</text>
  <text start="327.04" dur="3.93">Toronto we&amp;#39;ve been seeing this in</text>
  <text start="328.78" dur="3.93">Vancouver we&amp;#39;ve been seeing this around</text>
  <text start="330.97" dur="4.05">the country and remember Case Shiller</text>
  <text start="332.71" dur="4.41">only looks at those 20 cities and they</text>
  <text start="335.02" dur="3.42">pumped up these cities to make it look</text>
  <text start="337.12" dur="2.43">like the real estate market was doing a</text>
  <text start="338.44" dur="3.06">lot better than it really was but</text>
  <text start="339.55" dur="4.68">everything outside of these cities guess</text>
  <text start="341.5" dur="6.72">what prices are falling traffic is</text>
  <text start="344.23" dur="6.69">drying up and this is at a point where</text>
  <text start="348.22" dur="5.64">interest rates are at the lowest we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="350.92" dur="5.64">ever seen and they have programs right</text>
  <text start="353.86" dur="7.05">now where it allows people to come in</text>
  <text start="356.56" dur="7.53">with hardly any credit 0% down and once</text>
  <text start="360.91" dur="9.59">again we are stuck in the same exact</text>
  <text start="364.09" dur="9.63">position as we were back in 2008-2009</text>
  <text start="370.5" dur="6.28">nothing has changed all they did was</text>
  <text start="373.72" dur="6.18">create this gigantic illusion now the</text>
  <text start="376.78" dur="6.84">IMF is out there and they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="379.9" dur="5.91">about how the global economy is doing</text>
  <text start="383.62" dur="4.8">and how the global growth outlook looks</text>
  <text start="385.81" dur="4.35">and they&amp;#39;re saying that yeah</text>
  <text start="388.42" dur="3.96">things are starting to pick up things</text>
  <text start="390.16" dur="4.02">are starting to look a lot better and</text>
  <text start="392.38" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re saying the global GDP is going</text>
  <text start="394.18" dur="5.67">to expand by 3.6 percent in 2017 and 3.7</text>
  <text start="397.99" dur="4.98">percent in 2018 now we know when the IMF</text>
  <text start="399.85" dur="5.13">gives us their numbers it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="402.97" dur="3.48">overinflated they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="404.98" dur="3.66">u.s. is going to be growing at 2.2</text>
  <text start="406.45" dur="6.62">percent this year and 2.1 percent this</text>
  <text start="408.64" dur="8.1">year going into next year now remember</text>
  <text start="413.07" dur="7.3">these numbers are completely manipulated</text>
  <text start="416.74" dur="5.64">they are manipulated and they&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="420.37" dur="4.32">back especially in the United States all</text>
  <text start="422.38" dur="3.87">the way back to 1929 they included</text>
  <text start="424.69" dur="3.24">research and development recalculated</text>
  <text start="426.25" dur="4.02">the GDP all the way up to the current</text>
  <text start="427.93" dur="4.5">time they manipulated the numbers as</text>
  <text start="430.27" dur="3.57">much as they possibly can and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="432.43" dur="3.03">done this throughout the world not just</text>
  <text start="433.84" dur="4.02">here in the United States and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="435.46" dur="4.62">trying to figure out a way of convincing</text>
  <text start="437.86" dur="4.5">the public that everything is fine but</text>
  <text start="440.08" dur="4.62">buried in the report there was this</text>
  <text start="442.36" dur="6">warning from the IMF chief economist</text>
  <text start="444.7" dur="6.26">Maurice Obstfeld a closer look suggests</text>
  <text start="448.36" dur="4.95">that the global recovery may not be</text>
  <text start="450.96" dur="5.05">sustainable not all</text>
  <text start="453.31" dur="4.5">countries are participating inflation</text>
  <text start="456.01" dur="3.75">offer remains below target with weak</text>
  <text start="457.81" dur="4.17">wage growth and the medium-term outlook</text>
  <text start="459.76" dur="4.74">will still disappoints in many parts of</text>
  <text start="461.98" dur="5.64">the world what they&amp;#39;re really saying is</text>
  <text start="464.5" dur="5.1">that the economy is not fixed because</text>
  <text start="467.62" dur="3.63">they don&amp;#39;t mention this part they only</text>
  <text start="469.6" dur="3.9">mentioned the part like here are our</text>
  <text start="471.25" dur="4.5">numbers here are our statistics doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="473.5" dur="5.01">everything look great but when you delve</text>
  <text start="475.75" dur="3.93">into all these reports you see what</text>
  <text start="478.51" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re really talking about they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="479.68" dur="5.37">saying that this cannot be sustained the</text>
  <text start="482.11" dur="5.64">way it is why because countries have too</text>
  <text start="485.05" dur="5.4">much debt wage growth is declining</text>
  <text start="487.75" dur="4.23">people can&amp;#39;t find jobs and most of these</text>
  <text start="490.45" dur="4.8">countries that have a huge amount of</text>
  <text start="491.98" dur="6.48">debt they have austerity it cannot work</text>
  <text start="495.25" dur="6.15">out this way and the IMF is out there</text>
  <text start="498.46" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;re very optimistic on the rest of the</text>
  <text start="501.4" dur="3.51">world except for Britain of course</text>
  <text start="503.71" dur="4.17">Britain wants to leave the central</text>
  <text start="504.91" dur="5.25">banking system of the EU so now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="507.88" dur="4.74">saying that Britain is not going to do</text>
  <text start="510.16" dur="4.44">well during this period now of course</text>
  <text start="512.62" dur="3.69">this is fake phony and false like</text>
  <text start="514.6" dur="5.01">everything else but what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="516.31" dur="6.54">right now is they&amp;#39;re giving us this fake</text>
  <text start="519.61" dur="5.16">message that everything is falling just</text>
  <text start="522.85" dur="3.48">like the Fed came out Janet Yellen came</text>
  <text start="524.77" dur="4.02">out said we&amp;#39;re not going to see an</text>
  <text start="526.33" dur="5.49">economic crisis you know in our lifetime</text>
  <text start="528.79" dur="4.32">if we go back in time Bernanke said</text>
  <text start="531.82" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re not forecasting any type of</text>
  <text start="533.11" dur="5.01">recession anytime soon and we had the</text>
  <text start="535.27" dur="6.24">recession during the time he told us</text>
  <text start="538.12" dur="5.76">this so all of this is being built up to</text>
  <text start="541.51" dur="5.19">make us believe and think that the</text>
  <text start="543.88" dur="6.54">economy is going to continually do well</text>
  <text start="546.7" dur="5.94">but we&amp;#39;ve been looking at every single</text>
  <text start="550.42" dur="4.26">aspect of the economy and what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="552.64" dur="3.42">been seeing and we&amp;#39;ve been looking at a</text>
  <text start="554.68" dur="3.54">lot of indicators we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="556.06" dur="4.62">real information people have been</text>
  <text start="558.22" dur="4.89">writing in like crazy letting me know</text>
  <text start="560.68" dur="4.95">that things are not going well in their</text>
  <text start="563.11" dur="4.92">area they&amp;#39;re they were going well at one</text>
  <text start="565.63" dur="5.22">time but things are starting to fall off</text>
  <text start="568.03" dur="4.8">moles are completely empty the housing</text>
  <text start="570.85" dur="3.54">market is not doing well in many of the</text>
  <text start="572.83" dur="3.81">areas and people are starting to notice</text>
  <text start="574.39" dur="3.84">now these same people we&amp;#39;re writing in</text>
  <text start="576.64" dur="3.09">at one time saying that you know the</text>
  <text start="578.23" dur="4.08">housing market was fantastic in their</text>
  <text start="579.73" dur="5.58">area and now all of a sudden things have</text>
  <text start="582.31" dur="4.5">already switched so everything is about</text>
  <text start="585.31" dur="5.1">to change or is chained</text>
  <text start="586.81" dur="4.83">right now and as you can see the central</text>
  <text start="590.41" dur="3.6">bankers are out there trying to convince</text>
  <text start="591.64" dur="4.59">us that everything is going to be fine</text>
  <text start="594.01" dur="4.44">and once they start doing this we know</text>
  <text start="596.23" dur="4.56">right off the bat that things are going</text>
  <text start="598.45" dur="5.22">to start to deteriorate very very</text>
  <text start="600.79" dur="5.489">quickly now we see a lot of countries</text>
  <text start="603.67" dur="4.56">out there and they are moving away from</text>
  <text start="606.279" dur="3.75">the dollar we&amp;#39;re seeing country after</text>
  <text start="608.23" dur="3.57">country after country especially those</text>
  <text start="610.029" dur="3.331">countries with sanctions they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="611.8" dur="3.09">you know they&amp;#39;re just saying you know</text>
  <text start="613.36" dur="3.39">something we&amp;#39;re not dealing with the</text>
  <text start="614.89" dur="4.08">dollar anymore and we can see that</text>
  <text start="616.75" dur="5.04">Turkey right now they are doing a</text>
  <text start="618.97" dur="5.55">Eurasian pivot and they are going to be</text>
  <text start="621.79" dur="4.02">doing away with the dollar basically by</text>
  <text start="624.52" dur="3">passing the dollar because Turkey and</text>
  <text start="625.81" dur="4.11">Iran have officially announced that the</text>
  <text start="627.52" dur="6.48">future bilateral trade will be conducted</text>
  <text start="629.92" dur="6">in Iranian rial or Turkish lira so again</text>
  <text start="634" dur="4.05">we have Russia we have China we have</text>
  <text start="635.92" dur="4.29">Turkey we have Iran we have Syria we</text>
  <text start="638.05" dur="4.71">have Iraq we have many of these</text>
  <text start="640.21" dur="5.069">countries Venezuela and many others who</text>
  <text start="642.76" dur="4.65">are turning away from the dollar I mean</text>
  <text start="645.279" dur="4.861">Saudi Arabia already made that deal with</text>
  <text start="647.41" dur="5.04">Russia right now everyone is starting to</text>
  <text start="650.14" dur="4.65">pivot this is a slow pivot it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="652.45" dur="5.07">happen overnight because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="654.79" dur="3.9">the world to catch on and when I say the</text>
  <text start="657.52" dur="3.39">world I&amp;#39;m talking about the everyday</text>
  <text start="658.69" dur="4.17">person because if the everyday person</text>
  <text start="660.91" dur="3.66">started to realize that countries are</text>
  <text start="662.86" dur="3.36">turning away from the dollar people</text>
  <text start="664.57" dur="3.48">would get nervous that&amp;#39;d be panic and</text>
  <text start="666.22" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re trying to keep this very very</text>
  <text start="668.05" dur="3.09">quiet until the very very end they do</text>
  <text start="669.91" dur="3.23">this with pretty much everything the</text>
  <text start="671.14" dur="4.25">stock market the housing market the</text>
  <text start="673.14" dur="4.83">automobile market they do this every</text>
  <text start="675.39" dur="5.29">single area they keep it very very quiet</text>
  <text start="677.97" dur="4.3">until the very end until everything is</text>
  <text start="680.68" dur="3.24">said and done and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="682.27" dur="3">they just let loose and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="683.92" dur="4.29">really care what happens because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="685.27" dur="5.73">already set up and we can see that these</text>
  <text start="688.21" dur="5.67">countries they&amp;#39;re gonna continually do</text>
  <text start="691" dur="5.459">this wine because the United States the</text>
  <text start="693.88" dur="4.65">Cabal they are losing their power they</text>
  <text start="696.459" dur="4.141">can&amp;#39;t use the dollar to force countries</text>
  <text start="698.53" dur="4.62">into doing things they don&amp;#39;t want to do</text>
  <text start="700.6" dur="5.19">and we can see that sanctions are really</text>
  <text start="703.15" dur="5.34">having no effect whatsoever on many of</text>
  <text start="705.79" dur="5.669">the countries because they&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="708.49" dur="4.74">using the dollar at this point so as we</text>
  <text start="711.459" dur="3.661">move forward things are going to start</text>
  <text start="713.23" dur="3.99">to break down even further and as these</text>
  <text start="715.12" dur="4.35">countries stop using the dollar there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="717.22" dur="3.309">no real reason to keep the dollar in</text>
  <text start="719.47" dur="2.769">reserve</text>
  <text start="720.529" dur="3.6">so we&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot of countries</text>
  <text start="722.239" dur="3.06">start to sell their Treasury bonds we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="724.129" dur="3.15">gonna see a lot of countries start to</text>
  <text start="725.299" dur="3.9">sell or get rid of their dollar traded</text>
  <text start="727.279" dur="4.26">in maybe use them to buy gold or</text>
  <text start="729.199" dur="4.2">something else and we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="731.539" dur="4.95">this happen and it&amp;#39;s going to accelerate</text>
  <text start="733.399" dur="4.85">as we move forward just like we we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="736.489" dur="4.38">been seeing the d dollarization</text>
  <text start="738.249" dur="4">accelerate as we move forward into this</text>
  <text start="740.869" dur="2.61">year i think it&amp;#39;s just going to get</text>
  <text start="742.249" dur="2.58">worse and worse and worse because</text>
  <text start="743.479" dur="3">countries are gonna start to wake up and</text>
  <text start="744.829" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re gonna start to realize</text>
  <text start="746.479" dur="4.68">that yeah the dollar is pretty much</text>
  <text start="749.119" dur="3.45">doomed at this point and we better</text>
  <text start="751.159" dur="4.32">protect ourselves now they still might</text>
  <text start="752.569" dur="5.31">be dealing in the dollar while they use</text>
  <text start="755.479" dur="4.38">their own currency but what happens is</text>
  <text start="757.879" dur="4.05">they slowly move over to their own</text>
  <text start="759.859" dur="4.86">currency they move away from the dollar</text>
  <text start="761.929" dur="5.13">and this process will continue before</text>
  <text start="764.719" dur="4.44">you know it a lot of countries are not</text>
  <text start="767.059" dur="3.54">used in the dollar and people are just</text>
  <text start="769.159" dur="3.12">gonna wake up and say wow when did this</text>
  <text start="770.599" dur="4.83">happen this just happened right now no</text>
  <text start="772.279" dur="5.4">it happens very very slowly just like we</text>
  <text start="775.429" dur="5.34">see the deterioration of the retail</text>
  <text start="777.679" dur="6.36">market here in the United States where</text>
  <text start="780.769" dur="5.46">retail is imploding on itself just like</text>
  <text start="784.039" dur="4.26">we see the slow deterioration of the</text>
  <text start="786.229" dur="5.61">housing market it&amp;#39;s imploding on itself</text>
  <text start="788.299" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s a very very slow process just like</text>
  <text start="791.839" dur="4.17">the Central Bank took a very slow</text>
  <text start="793.369" dur="5.43">process of pumping it all up well that</text>
  <text start="796.009" dur="4.92">the the deflation of all these bubbles</text>
  <text start="798.799" dur="3.93">the popping of all these bubbles slowly</text>
  <text start="800.929" dur="4.77">deflates and all of a sudden it</text>
  <text start="802.729" dur="4.89">accelerates and boom everyone starts to</text>
  <text start="805.699" dur="4.32">realize what is really happening here</text>
  <text start="807.619" dur="4.65">this is why we&amp;#39;ve been telling everyone</text>
  <text start="810.019" dur="3.87">to get ready and prepared for what is</text>
  <text start="812.269" dur="3.84">coming this is why you need food because</text>
  <text start="813.889" dur="4.41">you don&amp;#39;t want to be running around when</text>
  <text start="816.109" dur="4.44">inflation hits an inflation will hit it</text>
  <text start="818.299" dur="3.99">always does it&amp;#39;s just a matter of time</text>
  <text start="820.549" dur="3.84">and remember they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating</text>
  <text start="822.289" dur="3.96">the inflation numbers a lot of the Fed</text>
  <text start="824.389" dur="3.87">houses have come up with their inflation</text>
  <text start="826.249" dur="4.08">numbers and there are a three percent</text>
  <text start="828.259" dur="4.41">three point one percent and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="830.329" dur="5.37">off loading the inflation into the stock</text>
  <text start="832.669" dur="5.43">market into the housing market into the</text>
  <text start="835.699" dur="4.95">college market into the health market</text>
  <text start="838.099" dur="5.22">across the ocean into other countries</text>
  <text start="840.649" dur="6.21">and eventually this is all going to come</text>
  <text start="843.319" dur="4.92">flooding back so you want to have food</text>
  <text start="846.859" dur="2.67">you want to have supplies because you</text>
  <text start="848.239" dur="3.21">don&amp;#39;t want to be running around when</text>
  <text start="849.529" dur="3.63">prices start to move up you want to make</text>
  <text start="851.449" dur="2.821">sure you have fuel you want to make sure</text>
  <text start="853.159" dur="3.601">you have gold and silver</text>
  <text start="854.27" dur="5.01">on hand because you will use the cash on</text>
  <text start="856.76" dur="4.41">hand first as the currency breaks down</text>
  <text start="859.28" dur="3.93">and when the currency becomes worthless</text>
  <text start="861.17" dur="4.17">you&amp;#39;ll probably move to bartering and</text>
  <text start="863.21" dur="4.71">then once bartering is over you move</text>
  <text start="865.34" dur="4.32">into gold and silver at this time as</text>
  <text start="867.92" dur="3.78">they create this new currency now the</text>
  <text start="869.66" dur="4.02">new currency might be a crypto currency</text>
  <text start="871.7" dur="4.5">a lot of people saying at the high level</text>
  <text start="873.68" dur="4.23">it might be the SDR at the low level it</text>
  <text start="876.2" dur="3.54">might be a crypto currency that every</text>
  <text start="877.91" dur="3.68">single country uses and of course the</text>
  <text start="879.74" dur="4.08">crypto currency that they want to use is</text>
  <text start="881.59" dur="4.03">controlled by the central bank that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="883.82" dur="4.4">what they&amp;#39;ve been planning on for a very</text>
  <text start="885.62" dur="4.86">long time but the people have to decide</text>
  <text start="888.22" dur="4.75">what they want to use we shouldn&amp;#39;t leave</text>
  <text start="890.48" dur="4.71">it up to the central bank to decide what</text>
  <text start="892.97" dur="5.13">we should be using the people should</text>
  <text start="895.19" dur="5.85">decide what we should be using and we</text>
  <text start="898.1" dur="4.53">should have a vote in to say you know</text>
  <text start="901.04" dur="3.93">something we don&amp;#39;t want the central bank</text>
  <text start="902.63" dur="3.93">to control our currency we&amp;#39;ve seen what</text>
  <text start="904.97" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;ve done in before they have too</text>
  <text start="906.56" dur="2.85">much power they&amp;#39;re not part of the</text>
  <text start="908.12" dur="4.26">government it&amp;#39;s a private corporation</text>
  <text start="909.41" dur="4.65">and there&amp;#39;s no reason for them to do</text>
  <text start="912.38" dur="4.71">this now if they take control of the</text>
  <text start="914.06" dur="5.37">crypto market they will have control</text>
  <text start="917.09" dur="6.51">over most everything because think about</text>
  <text start="919.43" dur="8.36">it control over the entire electronic</text>
  <text start="923.6" dur="7.26">currency would be a disaster for mankind</text>
  <text start="927.79" dur="5.17">it&amp;#39;d be better off if it was completely</text>
  <text start="930.86" dur="3.39">decentralized and there was no one</text>
  <text start="932.96" dur="3.54">controlling it because if they have</text>
  <text start="934.25" dur="4.89">control it&amp;#39;s not an open and free market</text>
  <text start="936.5" dur="6.57">it means they can manipulate it the way</text>
  <text start="939.14" dur="6.84">they want so we need to decide when the</text>
  <text start="943.07" dur="4.47">time comes of what we want</text>
