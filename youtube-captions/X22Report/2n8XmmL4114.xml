  <text start="101.94" dur="6.3">collapse financial news now as we know</text>
  <text start="104.25" dur="6.75">the economy has been built on a gigantic</text>
  <text start="108.24" dur="5.6">illusion where they&amp;#39;ve manipulated the</text>
  <text start="111" dur="6.09">unemployment numbers the GDP numbers</text>
  <text start="113.84" dur="5.289">almost every single statistical piece of</text>
  <text start="117.09" dur="3.389">information that they throw at us has</text>
  <text start="119.129" dur="3.121">been manipulated and this is why</text>
  <text start="120.479" dur="5.851">economists they&amp;#39;re having a very</text>
  <text start="122.25" dur="6.479">difficult time to explaining how wages</text>
  <text start="126.33" dur="5.1">have remained stagnant in a supposedly</text>
  <text start="128.729" dur="4.741">tight labor market because normally when</text>
  <text start="131.43" dur="4.65">you have you know supply and demand and</text>
  <text start="133.47" dur="4.46">you can&amp;#39;t find the workers wages move up</text>
  <text start="136.08" dur="5.61">but they&amp;#39;re not seeing this whatsoever</text>
  <text start="137.93" dur="6.61">now according to census data analyzed</text>
  <text start="141.69" dur="5.85">the number of Americans aged 85 and</text>
  <text start="144.54" dur="6.029">older they are still working and it has</text>
  <text start="147.54" dur="5.55">risen to record highs in recent years</text>
  <text start="150.569" dur="4.5">now the number of workers between ages</text>
  <text start="153.09" dur="4.14">of 18 and 30 who are out of the</text>
  <text start="155.069" dur="5.161">workforce hasn&amp;#39;t been this high since</text>
  <text start="157.23" dur="5.28">the 70s before large numbers of women</text>
  <text start="160.23" dur="3.92">entered the workforce now this is very</text>
  <text start="162.51" dur="5.43">interesting because when we look at this</text>
  <text start="164.15" dur="5.65">we understand that inflation has kicked</text>
  <text start="167.94" dur="3.18">in even though the Fed is reporting</text>
  <text start="169.8" dur="4.89">there is no inflation but you could see</text>
  <text start="171.12" dur="4.83">it in food you see it in fuel prices you</text>
  <text start="174.69" dur="4.17">see it in many different areas</text>
  <text start="175.95" dur="4.89">health care costs you see it in real</text>
  <text start="178.86" dur="4.47">estate you see it everywhere you also</text>
  <text start="180.84" dur="4.05">see it in college tuition and many</text>
  <text start="183.33" dur="5.19">different places now</text>
  <text start="184.89" dur="6.09">the everyday person who&amp;#39;s 85 or even 65</text>
  <text start="188.52" dur="6.33">and older who was on a fixed income they</text>
  <text start="190.98" dur="5.46">realize that their dollar isn&amp;#39;t going as</text>
  <text start="194.85" dur="4.2">far as it used to</text>
  <text start="196.44" dur="5.28">especially when fuel prices go up food</text>
  <text start="199.05" dur="5.25">prices go up health care costs go up</text>
  <text start="201.72" dur="4.5">they understand that well wait a minute</text>
  <text start="204.3" dur="5.07">something&amp;#39;s going on here and if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="206.22" dur="5.67">going to survive the next you know 15 20</text>
  <text start="209.37" dur="3.75">25 years I&amp;#39;m going to have to get</text>
  <text start="211.89" dur="3.62">another job and this is why these</text>
  <text start="213.12" dur="5.339">individuals are out there taking these</text>
  <text start="215.51" dur="5.05">low-paying jobs now if you have the</text>
  <text start="218.459" dur="6.421">older generation taking jobs like a</text>
  <text start="220.56" dur="8.94">crossing guard a librarian or maybe a</text>
  <text start="224.88" dur="8.49">tailor or maybe a barber and there are</text>
  <text start="229.5" dur="6.57">many older individuals that are now</text>
  <text start="233.37" dur="5.46">entering the workforce and this is a</text>
  <text start="236.07" dur="3.36">bizarre phenomenon that is happening</text>
  <text start="238.83" dur="2.64">right now</text>
  <text start="239.43" dur="4.71">while the growing number of young people</text>
  <text start="241.47" dur="4.769">they&amp;#39;ve been sidelined now remember the</text>
  <text start="244.14" dur="4.11">older generation they&amp;#39;re retired they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="246.239" dur="4.441">on a fixed income they&amp;#39;re not looking</text>
  <text start="248.25" dur="5.01">for raises or advancement they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="250.68" dur="5.22">looking to get extra money because their</text>
  <text start="253.26" dur="4.74">dollar is not going as far as they</text>
  <text start="255.9" dur="4.32">thought it was going to go the younger</text>
  <text start="258" dur="3.9">generation they&amp;#39;re looking for that</text>
  <text start="260.22" dur="3.66">higher paying job they&amp;#39;re looking to</text>
  <text start="261.9" dur="5.31">save up they&amp;#39;re looking to purchase a</text>
  <text start="263.88" dur="6.539">home purchase a car and make a career</text>
  <text start="267.21" dur="5.85">out of their job and the problem is they</text>
  <text start="270.419" dur="4.711">can&amp;#39;t find those jobs that&amp;#39;s the problem</text>
  <text start="273.06" dur="4.44">today so you have the older generation</text>
  <text start="275.13" dur="4.26">taking up a lot of part-time work you</text>
  <text start="277.5" dur="5.37">have the younger generation where they</text>
  <text start="279.39" dur="5.339">can&amp;#39;t find the jobs that they need to</text>
  <text start="282.87" dur="3.63">build their wealth because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="284.729" dur="6.571">completely impossible remember we&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="286.5" dur="6.479">the downside of this Phi at system that</text>
  <text start="291.3" dur="3.33">the central bankers created in the</text>
  <text start="292.979" dur="5.25">beginning in the 1970s when we came off</text>
  <text start="294.63" dur="6.63">the gold standard yes people went out</text>
  <text start="298.229" dur="4.321">they found jobs they found a career yes</text>
  <text start="301.26" dur="2.7">in the beginning in the 70s a little</text>
  <text start="302.55" dur="3.15">difficult a lot of people are out you</text>
  <text start="303.96" dur="3.87">know out of work but after all that</text>
  <text start="305.7" dur="3.3">cleared up and they were able to control</text>
  <text start="307.83" dur="3.03">it because remember when we came up with</text>
  <text start="309" dur="3.12">the gold standard the dollar dropped in</text>
  <text start="310.86" dur="3.54">value they had to raise the interest</text>
  <text start="312.12" dur="3.72">rates and this is a man to put us on the</text>
  <text start="314.4" dur="3.389">petrodollar system this is why we</text>
  <text start="315.84" dur="2.94">couldn&amp;#39;t find fuel but that wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="317.789" dur="2.611">really</text>
  <text start="318.78" dur="4.17">the real story it was because they were</text>
  <text start="320.4" dur="6.3">moving us all from a gold standard on to</text>
  <text start="322.95" dur="6">a oil-based system on to their finance</text>
  <text start="326.7" dur="4.71">system now we&amp;#39;re on the opposite end</text>
  <text start="328.95" dur="4.47">interest rates very very low wages are</text>
  <text start="331.41" dur="4.41">not rising remember in the 70s wages</text>
  <text start="333.42" dur="6.75">shot up house price everything just shot</text>
  <text start="335.82" dur="7.08">up all at once to adjust for the D the</text>
  <text start="340.17" dur="5.37">the declining value of the dollar here</text>
  <text start="342.9" dur="5.88">the dollars declining but interest rates</text>
  <text start="345.54" dur="5.7">are declining wages are declining and</text>
  <text start="348.78" dur="4.38">the younger generation there&amp;#39;s just no</text>
  <text start="351.24" dur="5.52">jobs for them they can&amp;#39;t find the</text>
  <text start="353.16" dur="5.49">high-paying jobs and the lower paying</text>
  <text start="356.76" dur="4.409">jobs where people aren&amp;#39;t looking to make</text>
  <text start="358.65" dur="5.22">more money those are being filled by the</text>
  <text start="361.169" dur="4.681">older workers remember the immigration</text>
  <text start="363.87" dur="4.56">that Obama set up there are bringing in</text>
  <text start="365.85" dur="4.26">all these third-world individuals to</text>
  <text start="368.43" dur="3.12">fill these positions because they knew</text>
  <text start="370.11" dur="5.55">eventually what was going to happen is</text>
  <text start="371.55" dur="7.44">that this was going to become a third</text>
  <text start="375.66" dur="6.09">world nation and the low paying jobs</text>
  <text start="378.99" dur="4.05">they need people to fill these and this</text>
  <text start="381.75" dur="2.49">is what this is part of the immigration</text>
  <text start="383.04" dur="2.79">this is why they are having these</text>
  <text start="384.24" dur="3.81">individuals and there&amp;#39;s many other parts</text>
  <text start="385.83" dur="4.649">of it but that was one of the parts and</text>
  <text start="388.05" dur="4.679">we can see that the older generation is</text>
  <text start="390.479" dur="3.541">taking up the slack because now they</text>
  <text start="392.729" dur="3.75">find themselves in a bond because</text>
  <text start="394.02" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re on a fixed income and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="396.479" dur="7.291">make ends meet so economists are trying</text>
  <text start="400.11" dur="6.9">to figure all this out you know if the</text>
  <text start="403.77" dur="6.06">job market is filled to capacity why</text>
  <text start="407.01" dur="4.17">aren&amp;#39;t we seeing wages go up because the</text>
  <text start="409.83" dur="1.92">job markets really not filled to</text>
  <text start="411.18" dur="3.45">capacity</text>
  <text start="411.75" dur="5.94">that&amp;#39;s manipulated it&amp;#39;s not there and</text>
  <text start="414.63" dur="4.349">we&amp;#39;re not going to see an economic boom</text>
  <text start="417.69" dur="3.6">and this is coming out of real</text>
  <text start="418.979" dur="3.871">investment advice calm and they put</text>
  <text start="421.29" dur="5.4">together all these different charts and</text>
  <text start="422.85" dur="6.42">explanations of why the economy is not</text>
  <text start="426.69" dur="4.2">going to all of a sudden take off and it</text>
  <text start="429.27" dur="3.66">can&amp;#39;t under this economy this is a</text>
  <text start="430.89" dur="4.23">central banking economy and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="432.93" dur="4.62">going to work first of all we see that</text>
  <text start="435.12" dur="4.29">wages well they are failing to keep up</text>
  <text start="437.55" dur="3.39">with even historically low rates of</text>
  <text start="439.41" dur="3.72">reported inflation this is what we see a</text>
  <text start="440.94" dur="3.45">lot of the older generation coming back</text>
  <text start="443.13" dur="4.17">into the workforce because they&amp;#39;re on a</text>
  <text start="444.39" dur="5.73">fixed income and wages are not keeping</text>
  <text start="447.3" dur="4.56">up with inflation that means wages</text>
  <text start="450.12" dur="5.37">aren&amp;#39;t increasing</text>
  <text start="451.86" dur="6.959">and inflation is taking over we see the</text>
  <text start="455.49" dur="5.25">illusion of prosperity the illusion of</text>
  <text start="458.819" dur="4.761">economic growth has been fueled by</text>
  <text start="460.74" dur="5.669">ever-increasing levels of debt to</text>
  <text start="463.58" dur="6.01">support consumption which means everyone</text>
  <text start="466.409" dur="6.931">is using credit cards and debt to live</text>
  <text start="469.59" dur="6.299">their lives and if you back out the</text>
  <text start="473.34" dur="4.889">level of debt you actually get a better</text>
  <text start="475.889" dur="6.78">picture of what is actually happening in</text>
  <text start="478.229" dur="7.59">the economy when you look at it if</text>
  <text start="482.669" dur="5.641">people didn&amp;#39;t have debt credit cards</text>
  <text start="485.819" dur="5.581">taking loans out to purchase car people</text>
  <text start="488.31" dur="5.49">would not be able to survive and if we</text>
  <text start="491.4" dur="5.699">look at the debt-free real GDP growth we</text>
  <text start="493.8" dur="7.29">see since the 70s it has been declining</text>
  <text start="497.099" dur="7.44">not increasing and when credit creation</text>
  <text start="501.09" dur="6.09">can no longer be sustained the markets</text>
  <text start="504.539" dur="5.16">must begin to clear the excesses before</text>
  <text start="507.18" dur="4.5">the cycle can begin again that clearing</text>
  <text start="509.699" dur="4.47">process is going to be very substantial</text>
  <text start="511.68" dur="4.08">with the economy currently requiring</text>
  <text start="514.169" dur="3.901">roughly about three dollars and fifty</text>
  <text start="515.76" dur="5.49">cents of debt to create one dollar of</text>

  <text start="521.25" dur="3.959">structurally manageable level of debt</text>
  <text start="522.99" dur="4.38">would involve a twenty five trillion</text>
  <text start="525.209" dur="5.971">reduction of total credit market debt</text>
  <text start="527.37" dur="6.93">from the current levels now again we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="537.48" dur="5.669">happen we need to wipe this system out</text>
  <text start="540.029" dur="6.56">and start over let&amp;#39;s continue borrowing</text>
  <text start="543.149" dur="6.841">from the future beginning in 1990</text>
  <text start="546.589" dur="5.351">incomes alone we&amp;#39;re no longer able to</text>
  <text start="549.99" dur="5.52">meet the standard of living so consumers</text>
  <text start="551.94" dur="5.97">turn to debt to fill the gap however</text>
  <text start="555.51" dur="5.34">following the financial crisis even the</text>
  <text start="557.91" dur="5.34">combined levels of income and debt no</text>

  <text start="563.25" dur="7.05">about almost 7,000 annual deficit that</text>
  <text start="567.39" dur="4.559">cannot be fulfilled in the past when</text>

  <text start="655.89" dur="4.68">anything off the ground so we have two</text>
  <text start="658.02" dur="5.82">things happening right now at the end of</text>
  <text start="660.57" dur="6.12">a central bank system and both sides</text>
  <text start="663.84" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re finding it difficult to survive</text>
  <text start="666.69" dur="5.93">right now we also have this gigantic</text>
  <text start="669.06" dur="6.45">debt bubble rising interest rates are</text>
  <text start="672.62" dur="6.36">attacks when combined with stronger</text>
  <text start="675.51" dur="5.91">dollar which negatively impacts exports</text>
  <text start="678.98" dur="4.63">exports make up roughly around 40% of</text>
  <text start="681.42" dur="4.89">total corporate profits the catalysts</text>
  <text start="683.61" dur="6.6">are in place for a problem to emerge now</text>
  <text start="686.31" dur="6.57">we see at this point that there is so</text>
  <text start="690.21" dur="4.2">much debt right now that and that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="692.88" dur="3.39">just the debt for the government but</text>
  <text start="694.41" dur="5.61">debt on people debt and corporations</text>
  <text start="696.27" dur="5.4">that everywhere the debt load cannot be</text>
  <text start="700.02" dur="3.96">sustained when we came off of the gold</text>
  <text start="701.67" dur="4.41">center back in the 70s we didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="703.98" dur="3.81">that much debt we were on a gold</text>
  <text start="706.08" dur="3.57">standard yes they were creating currency</text>
  <text start="707.79" dur="4.44">at the time but once we came off the</text>
  <text start="709.65" dur="4.77">gold standard boom it was just a lot</text>
  <text start="712.23" dur="4.35">more debt added to the system once we</text>
  <text start="714.42" dur="3.93">hit in 2008 they just opened the</text>
  <text start="716.58" dur="2.479">floodgates and they created as much debt</text>
  <text start="718.35" dur="2.139">as they</text>
  <text start="719.059" dur="3.57">possibly could because is the only way</text>
  <text start="720.489" dur="4.18">government would be able to survive and</text>
  <text start="722.629" dur="6.9">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="724.669" dur="7.32">growth is declining right now it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="729.529" dur="5.19">increasing it&amp;#39;s not getting better they</text>
  <text start="731.989" dur="4.29">manipulated the GDP numbers and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="734.719" dur="4.25">trying to make it seem like that growth</text>
  <text start="736.279" dur="5.97">is actually happening which it is not</text>
  <text start="738.969" dur="4.39">the unemployment that we see today where</text>
  <text start="742.249" dur="2.7">they&amp;#39;re telling us you know it&amp;#39;s four</text>
  <text start="743.359" dur="4.77">percent or three point nine percent</text>
  <text start="744.949" dur="4.92">well that is manipulated those numbers</text>
  <text start="748.129" dur="4.08">are manipulated and we actually see</text>
  <text start="749.869" dur="5.55">those people who are out of work rising</text>
  <text start="752.209" dur="4.92">at a very very fast rate so the whole</text>
  <text start="755.419" dur="4.67">thing is completely falling apart so</text>
  <text start="757.129" dur="5.28">what is the central bank doing right now</text>
  <text start="760.089" dur="4.51">to make sure that nobody understands</text>
  <text start="762.409" dur="5.01">what&amp;#39;s really going on they&amp;#39;re hiding a</text>
  <text start="764.599" dur="5.19">lot of their data they&amp;#39;re getting rid of</text>
  <text start="767.419" dur="3.99">the yield curve indicator that we you</text>
  <text start="769.789" dur="3.45">know that reports when we&amp;#39;re going into</text>
  <text start="771.409" dur="4.08">a recession they&amp;#39;re getting rid of the</text>
  <text start="773.239" dur="3.99">data on their balance sheet we see the</text>
  <text start="775.489" dur="4.23">corporate media right now pushing the</text>
  <text start="777.229" dur="5.49">idea that we&amp;#39;re a heading towards a</text>
  <text start="779.719" dur="3.66">recession we also see the Federal</text>
  <text start="782.719" dur="6">Reserve</text>
  <text start="783.379" dur="7.71">they helped top US banks they they</text>
  <text start="788.719" dur="3.15">helped them to avoid a stress test</text>
  <text start="791.089" dur="6.9">failure</text>
  <text start="791.869" dur="8.61">now remember during 2008 after the</text>
  <text start="797.989" dur="3.87">financial crisis the Fed came out and</text>
  <text start="800.479" dur="3.51">said we&amp;#39;re gonna create these stress</text>
  <text start="801.859" dur="3.66">tests to show everyone that banks are</text>
  <text start="803.989" dur="3.33">strong and they keep coming out with</text>
  <text start="805.519" dur="3.57">them telling you how great the banks are</text>
  <text start="807.319" dur="3.15">and whenever a central banker comes out</text>
  <text start="809.089" dur="3.56">and tells you how great things are is</text>
  <text start="810.469" dur="6.23">actually the app the opposite happening</text>
  <text start="812.649" dur="7.03">so the US Federal Reserve struck an</text>
  <text start="816.699" dur="5.41">unprecedented bargain with Goldman Sachs</text>
  <text start="819.679" dur="5.19">and Morgan Stanley ahead of a recent</text>
  <text start="822.109" dur="6.54">stress test that allowed the two Banking</text>
  <text start="824.869" dur="7.77">Giants to avoid an outright failing</text>
  <text start="828.649" dur="8.58">grade think about this for a second so</text>
  <text start="832.639" dur="7.38">on Friday June 22nd the Fed said 34 of</text>
  <text start="837.229" dur="5.61">the nation&amp;#39;s 35 largest banks had had</text>
  <text start="840.019" dur="4.74">adequate capital plans to survive a</text>
  <text start="842.839" dur="3.69">financial crisis this is their fake tres</text>
  <text start="844.759" dur="4.29">stress tests letting us know that</text>
  <text start="846.529" dur="4.62">everything is great and they did this to</text>
  <text start="849.049" dur="3.901">get everyone on board to think that</text>
  <text start="851.149" dur="3.241">don&amp;#39;t worry the banks are good</text>
  <text start="852.95" dur="6.3">keep your money in there everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="854.39" dur="8.25">great no problems of the 34 banks the</text>
  <text start="859.25" dur="5.01">Board issued conditional non objections</text>
  <text start="862.64" dur="3.78">to the capital plans of three</text>
  <text start="864.26" dur="6.09">institutions including Goldman Sachs and</text>
  <text start="866.42" dur="5.52">Morgan Stanley now on June 21st US</text>
  <text start="870.35" dur="3.51">federal regulators in a phone</text>
  <text start="871.94" dur="4.47">conversation told Goldman Sachs and</text>
  <text start="873.86" dur="4.47">Morgan Stanley that to fully past the</text>
  <text start="876.41" dur="4.8">stress test the banks needed to cut in</text>
  <text start="878.33" dur="5.1">half the combined 16 billion in</text>
  <text start="881.21" dur="6.12">shareholder payouts they had hoped to</text>
  <text start="883.43" dur="6.57">allocate and as part of an unprecedented</text>
  <text start="887.33" dur="5.49">deal the Fed allowed the banks to</text>
  <text start="890" dur="5.76">maintain a thirteen billion payout level</text>
  <text start="892.82" dur="5.76">in exchange for a conditional non</text>
  <text start="895.76" dur="4.83">objection great the banks were basically</text>
  <text start="898.58" dur="4.44">allowed to pay out about five billion</text>
  <text start="900.59" dur="4.65">more than they should have while at the</text>
  <text start="903.02" dur="4.32">same time avoiding the public black-eye</text>
  <text start="905.24" dur="5.49">that comes with an outright failing</text>
  <text start="907.34" dur="5.49">grade the bar the bargain according to</text>
  <text start="910.73" dur="4.68">the report will also boost profitability</text>
  <text start="912.83" dur="6.81">measures that help calculate salaries</text>
  <text start="915.41" dur="8.28">for the firm&amp;#39;s CEOs so the Fed right now</text>
  <text start="919.64" dur="6.03">and the Wall Street banks decided hey we</text>
  <text start="923.69" dur="5.4">don&amp;#39;t want to fail the stress test so</text>
  <text start="925.67" dur="5.1">let&amp;#39;s get around this and the with the</text>
  <text start="929.09" dur="4.35">help of the Fed they&amp;#39;ll give us a</text>
  <text start="930.77" dur="6.57">passing grade so this tells us if these</text>
  <text start="933.44" dur="6.87">two banks are failing right now and they</text>
  <text start="937.34" dur="5.28">paid out to get a conditional non</text>
  <text start="940.31" dur="4.65">objection grade how do you think the</text>
  <text start="942.62" dur="4.1">other banks are doing I mean think about</text>
  <text start="944.96" dur="4.05">this for a second we know Deutsche Bank</text>
  <text start="946.72" dur="4.72">they&amp;#39;re dead in the water we know the</text>
  <text start="949.01" dur="4.11">Italian banks the Spanish banks they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="951.44" dur="3.9">not doing well either that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="953.12" dur="4.44">insolvent same thing with the US banks</text>
  <text start="955.34" dur="4.67">all these buybacks and everything that</text>
  <text start="957.56" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;ve been doing has been covering up</text>
  <text start="960.01" dur="4.27">for what is really happening and that</text>
  <text start="962.39" dur="3.48">these banks they really can&amp;#39;t survive</text>
  <text start="964.28" dur="2.55">now remember the bids came out and</text>
  <text start="965.87" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re already separating themselves</text>
  <text start="966.83" dur="3.65">from these banks and where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="969.05" dur="6.21">saying that a lot of these banks are</text>
  <text start="970.48" dur="6.22">using the Lehman style approach to do</text>
  <text start="975.26" dur="3">their books to make them look like</text>
  <text start="976.7" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re a lot better off than they</text>
  <text start="978.26" dur="3.45">really are and we&amp;#39;re already starting to</text>
  <text start="980.33" dur="3.77">see evidence that these banks are</text>
  <text start="981.71" dur="5.33">already in trouble and</text>
  <text start="984.1" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re having the Fed cover up for what</text>
  <text start="987.04" dur="4.14">is really happening here and you know</text>
  <text start="988.87" dur="4.77">once we get into this next financial</text>
  <text start="991.18" dur="5.31">crisis it&amp;#39;s going to be a complete and</text>
  <text start="993.64" dur="4.74">utter disaster think about and if we</text>
  <text start="996.49" dur="3.33">would let me just repeat this think</text>
  <text start="998.38" dur="2.96">about what the Fed has been doing and</text>
  <text start="999.82" dur="4.62">this is just in the last couple of weeks</text>
