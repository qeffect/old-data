  <text start="52.93" dur="6.09">episode 1164 a and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="56.32" dur="4.95">December 28th 2016 and the thought of</text>
  <text start="59.02" dur="3.9">the episode is the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="61.27" dur="5.52">warning that under Trump&amp;#39;s policies the</text>
  <text start="62.92" dur="6.93">market might turn in 2017 let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="66.79" dur="5.81">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="69.85" dur="5.58">today we can see the market well it</text>
  <text start="72.6" dur="5.59">declined a little bit by one hundred or</text>
  <text start="75.43" dur="4.02">so points and we see all over the</text>
  <text start="78.19" dur="4.08">corporate media you know they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="79.45" dur="4.919">about the stock market how oh it might</text>
  <text start="82.27" dur="5.01">not hit 20,000 points right now look</text>
  <text start="84.369" dur="6.36">what just happened and when we look at</text>
  <text start="87.28" dur="4.68">this we can see that this most likely is</text>
  <text start="90.729" dur="4.351">part of their plan now I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="91.96" dur="6.51">that one hundred percent this is going</text>
  <text start="95.08" dur="5.01">to hit 20,000 points on Friday remember</text>
  <text start="98.47" dur="3.72">we&amp;#39;re looking at indicators we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="100.09" dur="4.8">looking at what these individuals do</text>
  <text start="102.19" dur="3.959">their thought process and from</text>
  <text start="104.89" dur="3.42">everything that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="106.149" dur="4.741">and everything that we&amp;#39;ve been saying we</text>
  <text start="108.31" dur="4.29">can make conclusions I mean they brought</text>
  <text start="110.89" dur="3.659">unemployment down to four point nine</text>
  <text start="112.6" dur="3.57">percent right before the election we</text>
  <text start="114.549" dur="3">thought it was going to happen and I was</text>
  <text start="116.17" dur="3.96">actually surprised when it didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="117.549" dur="3.781">until what two three days before the</text>
  <text start="120.13" dur="3.89">election came down to four point nine</text>
  <text start="121.33" dur="5.7">percent then right after the election</text>
  <text start="124.02" dur="4.81">they came down even further to four</text>
  <text start="127.03" dur="4.11">point six percent right before the</text>
  <text start="128.83" dur="4.77">election all of a sudden GDP surged to</text>
  <text start="131.14" dur="4.65">two-point-nine percent again revised</text>
  <text start="133.6" dur="5.25">after the elections to three point five</text>
  <text start="135.79" dur="7.43">percent and here we are with the Dow I</text>
  <text start="138.85" dur="7.8">mean to take this entire economy and</text>
  <text start="143.22" dur="5.65">have the Dow hit 20,000 points this is</text>
  <text start="146.65" dur="4.83">exactly what the central bankers Obama</text>
  <text start="148.87" dur="5.61">want they want everyone to believe that</text>
  <text start="151.48" dur="5.1">this economy is completely recovered</text>
  <text start="154.48" dur="4.62">everything is fine nothing to worry</text>
  <text start="156.58" dur="5.159">about so when we look at all the</text>
  <text start="159.1" dur="4.979">information that we&amp;#39;ve gathered and we</text>
  <text start="161.739" dur="4.59">put all the pieces together and we get</text>
  <text start="164.079" dur="6.211">into their train of thought we can say</text>
  <text start="166.329" dur="6.781">listen to make it look real and to make</text>
  <text start="170.29" dur="5.34">it look convincing what we need to do is</text>
  <text start="173.11" dur="5.91">not have a hit 20,000 points just yet</text>
  <text start="175.63" dur="5.28">let&amp;#39;s wait and have it decline a little</text>
  <text start="179.02" dur="2.7">bit so people say okay it&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="180.91" dur="2.88">obvious</text>
  <text start="181.72" dur="4.02">maybe it won&amp;#39;t hit 20,000 points and</text>
  <text start="183.79" dur="5">then come thursday maybe bring it up a</text>
  <text start="185.74" dur="7.62">little bit not too much and then friday</text>
  <text start="188.79" dur="7.39">boom bring it over 20,000 points now is</text>
  <text start="193.36" dur="4.71">it going to happen we don&amp;#39;t know but</text>
  <text start="196.18" dur="4.95">what we&amp;#39;re doing is we&amp;#39;re following and</text>
  <text start="198.07" dur="5.34">trying to figure out exactly what they</text>
  <text start="201.13" dur="4.59">are up to and everything is pointing to</text>
  <text start="203.41" dur="4.08">this right now and I would actually be</text>
  <text start="205.72" dur="3.33">very surprised if they don&amp;#39;t push it</text>
  <text start="207.49" dur="3.78">over 20,000 points but we&amp;#39;ll wait and</text>
  <text start="209.05" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;ll see and we&amp;#39;ll see what happens but</text>
  <text start="211.27" dur="4.62">when we look at all the other economic</text>
  <text start="213.46" dur="6.24">indicators and we look at the hard data</text>
  <text start="215.89" dur="5.58">we see that the Obama administration the</text>
  <text start="219.7" dur="4.23">central bank well they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="221.47" dur="5.96">manipulating a lot of information to</text>
  <text start="223.93" dur="6.65">keep the illusion that this economy is</text>
  <text start="227.43" dur="6.04">really doing a lot better than it is and</text>
  <text start="230.58" dur="4.75">we&amp;#39;ve been following all the economic</text>
  <text start="233.47" dur="4.02">indicators we&amp;#39;ve been tracking them and</text>
  <text start="235.33" dur="4.83">from our data it shows that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="237.49" dur="5.94">actually in a recession heading towards</text>
  <text start="240.16" dur="4.86">a collapse scenario and everything the</text>
  <text start="243.43" dur="3.029">corporate media is pushing out there</text>
  <text start="245.02" dur="4.26">everything the Obama administration is</text>
  <text start="246.459" dur="6">pushing out there well I&amp;#39;m going to say</text>
  <text start="249.28" dur="5.19">this is all fake news because what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="252.459" dur="5.071">really looking at is things are rapidly</text>
  <text start="254.47" dur="5.67">falling apart when we look at let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="257.53" dur="3.9">pending home sales today we see that</text>
  <text start="260.14" dur="4.47">pending home sales while they have</text>
  <text start="261.43" dur="5.63">tumbled and this kind of makes sense</text>
  <text start="264.61" dur="5.91">because mortgage rates are surging and</text>
  <text start="267.06" dur="4.57">pending home sales have declined the</text>
  <text start="270.52" dur="3.48">national association of realtors</text>
  <text start="271.63" dur="4.32">reported that November the pending home</text>
  <text start="274" dur="5.91">sales they plunge of the lowest level in</text>
  <text start="275.95" dur="6.96">nearly a year they slid about 2.5% now</text>
  <text start="279.91" dur="6.72">this is completely opposite of existing</text>
  <text start="282.91" dur="6.9">home sales and new home sales but we</text>
  <text start="286.63" dur="5.97">know you can manipulate this data by</text>
  <text start="289.81" dur="5.76">revising by having hedge funds</text>
  <text start="292.6" dur="5.64">investment companies purchase these</text>
  <text start="295.57" dur="4.409">homes and at this point with the pending</text>
  <text start="298.24" dur="3.84">home sales I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="299.979" dur="3.811">too worried about this anymore because</text>
  <text start="302.08" dur="3.899">right now all eyes are going to be on</text>
  <text start="303.79" dur="4.65">the stock market and they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="305.979" dur="6.361">looking at that and saying okay see the</text>
  <text start="308.44" dur="6.289">economy is absolutely fine and mark</text>
  <text start="312.34" dur="4.669">hansen is looking at this</text>
  <text start="314.729" dur="4.5">he&amp;#39;s saying that okay we&amp;#39;ve reached the</text>
  <text start="317.009" dur="6.18">point where home sales are at the</text>
  <text start="319.229" dur="7.05">highest point ever well in 20 cities not</text>
  <text start="323.189" dur="5.641">the entire country remember that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="326.279" dur="6.271">saying that in a couple months we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="328.83" dur="6.419">probably see a complete disaster in the</text>
  <text start="332.55" dur="5.1">real estate market that there&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="335.249" dur="4.5">be a lot more pain in the housing market</text>
  <text start="337.65" dur="3.299">and I can definitely see this coming</text>
  <text start="339.749" dur="3.48">we&amp;#39;ve been following this and I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="340.949" dur="5.4">looking at houses in the Northeast in</text>
  <text start="343.229" dur="6.06">the midwest and the south out in the</text>
  <text start="346.349" dur="4.47">west and I&amp;#39;m not looking at the 20</text>
  <text start="349.289" dur="4.671">cities I&amp;#39;m looking outside of that area</text>
  <text start="350.819" dur="7.02">and real estate is a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="353.96" dur="5.47">when the mortgage rates increased houses</text>
  <text start="357.839" dur="4.47">have been on the market even longer and</text>
  <text start="359.43" dur="5.009">people are trying to desperately sell</text>
  <text start="362.309" dur="5.64">them by lowering their prices but guess</text>
  <text start="364.439" dur="7.681">what nobody is coming to purchase this</text>
  <text start="367.949" dur="6.36">is the main problem most of the homes in</text>
  <text start="372.12" dur="4.039">these 20 cities were purchased by hedge</text>
  <text start="374.309" dur="4.47">funds and investment companies</text>
  <text start="376.159" dur="4.6">Blackstone at one point was spending</text>
  <text start="378.779" dur="4.98">about a hundred million dollars a week</text>
  <text start="380.759" dur="5.7">and they purchased something like forty</text>
  <text start="383.759" dur="5.31">three thousand homes keep them off the</text>
  <text start="386.459" dur="4.44">market rent them if you can and when you</text>
  <text start="389.069" dur="5.671">keep homes off the market it drives</text>
  <text start="390.899" dur="6.06">prices up and we could see why all this</text>
  <text start="394.74" dur="5.82">is happening right now because they need</text>
  <text start="396.959" dur="7.05">this illusion they need everyone to</text>
  <text start="400.56" dur="8.49">believe that the economy is really doing</text>
  <text start="404.009" dur="6.75">well this is why the central bank had to</text>
  <text start="409.05" dur="4.709">raise the interest rates at the last</text>
  <text start="410.759" dur="4.05">minute in December of 2016 of course if</text>
  <text start="413.759" dur="2.25">they didn&amp;#39;t they would lose all</text>
  <text start="414.809" dur="2.76">credibility because they said they were</text>
  <text start="416.009" dur="4.62">going to raise the rates not once not</text>
  <text start="417.569" dur="5.43">twice maybe three times in 2016 and they</text>
  <text start="420.629" dur="4.38">only did it once which shows you that</text>
  <text start="422.999" dur="5.91">they were really never going to do this</text>
  <text start="425.009" dur="4.861">three times during 27 2016 actually</text>
  <text start="428.909" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re not even going to do it that</text>
  <text start="429.87" dur="4.349">many times during 2017 because of course</text>
  <text start="432.959" dur="3.3">they were saying oh it&amp;#39;s the data it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="434.219" dur="4.17">the data it stayed it&amp;#39;s the data but</text>
  <text start="436.259" dur="4.261">here we are with unemployment at 4.6</text>
  <text start="438.389" dur="4.38">percent it was at four point nine</text>
  <text start="440.52" dur="3.899">percent for quite a while the stock</text>
  <text start="442.769" dur="4.44">market keeps moving up and up and up and</text>
  <text start="444.419" dur="4.261">up and they&amp;#39;re trying to convince us</text>
  <text start="447.209" dur="3.571">that retail is doing well</text>
  <text start="448.68" dur="5.43">housings doing well everything&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="450.78" dur="6.09">fine but under all of this they know the</text>
  <text start="454.11" dur="6.75">economy is a complete disaster they know</text>
  <text start="456.87" dur="6.51">that if they increase rates a lot well</text>
  <text start="460.86" dur="5.16">the whole thing comes crashing down in a</text>
  <text start="463.38" dur="4.98">split second and I do believe this was</text>
  <text start="466.02" dur="5.55">their signal saying that okay it&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="468.36" dur="6.869">to bring this entire system down now the</text>
  <text start="471.57" dur="6.33">central banks we know they are trying to</text>
  <text start="475.229" dur="4.5">get rid of cash and they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="477.9" dur="4.859">it as quickly as possible they used</text>
  <text start="479.729" dur="4.56">India as a test case and we can see</text>
  <text start="482.759" dur="3.931">right now that they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="484.289" dur="4.711">pushing this forward now we know the</text>
  <text start="486.69" dur="4.11">central banks right now they do not like</text>
  <text start="489" dur="3.27">cash whatsoever and I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="490.8" dur="4.83">physical cash not their electronic</text>
  <text start="492.27" dur="5.489">dollars and we see right now that John</text>
  <text start="495.63" dur="4.62">Janet Yellen is out there thinking she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="497.759" dur="8.821">saying that the US dollar is not a</text>
  <text start="500.25" dur="8.58">convenient store of value and well she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.58" dur="5.13">actually correct because we know the</text>
  <text start="508.83" dur="6.48">dollar has lost ninety-six percent of</text>
  <text start="511.71" dur="7.41">its value its purchasing power over the</text>
  <text start="515.31" dur="6.3">last 100 years or so and anyone who has</text>
  <text start="519.12" dur="7.02">kept their money in cash has generally</text>
  <text start="521.61" dur="8.01">lost money virtually non-stop now</text>
  <text start="526.14" dur="7.139">remember right now throughout Europe and</text>
  <text start="529.62" dur="6.54">in Japan we have negative interest rates</text>
  <text start="533.279" dur="5.161">and here in the United States the</text>
  <text start="536.16" dur="4.35">interest rates are very very low they</text>
  <text start="538.44" dur="4.769">don&amp;#39;t want people keeping their cash in</text>
  <text start="540.51" dur="4.05">the banks they want them to take it and</text>
  <text start="543.209" dur="3.481">put it into bonds they want to take it</text>
  <text start="544.56" dur="4.29">to put into real estate put it into the</text>
  <text start="546.69" dur="6.589">stock market but this hasn&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="548.85" dur="9.35">working and they did this on purpose</text>
  <text start="553.279" dur="7.571">because they wanted to boost the</text>
  <text start="558.2" dur="5.47">illusion that the economy was doing well</text>
  <text start="560.85" dur="4.08">now one thing they didn&amp;#39;t realize or</text>
  <text start="563.67" dur="3.359">maybe they did realize it but they</text>
  <text start="564.93" dur="3.719">didn&amp;#39;t really care is that people were</text>
  <text start="567.029" dur="4.261">losing jobs left and right and since</text>
  <text start="568.649" dur="6.241">2008 people lost a lot of their wealth</text>
  <text start="571.29" dur="6.78">and people don&amp;#39;t have the funds they</text>
  <text start="574.89" dur="6.319">used to have and this is why most of the</text>
  <text start="578.07" dur="4.38">people aren&amp;#39;t taking their currency and</text>
  <text start="581.209" dur="2.981">doing</text>
  <text start="582.45" dur="3.84">they want and what do they want they</text>
  <text start="584.19" dur="5.16">want people to take their currency and</text>
  <text start="586.29" dur="4.56">spend in retail it&amp;#39;s not happening they</text>
  <text start="589.35" dur="3.75">wanted people to take their currency and</text>
  <text start="590.85" dur="4.17">put it into the stock market what we can</text>
  <text start="593.1" dur="4.44">see right now the stock market is being</text>
  <text start="595.02" dur="4.59">boosted by the plunge protection team</text>
  <text start="597.54" dur="3.84">the high-frequency traders the free</text>
  <text start="599.61" dur="3.72">money from the Fed where they give it to</text>
  <text start="601.38" dur="3.72">the sent the banks and the banks take it</text>
  <text start="603.33" dur="4.17">and they pour it into the stock market</text>
  <text start="605.1" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s not the everyday retail investor</text>
  <text start="607.5" dur="3.93">yes they might be riding the wave right</text>
  <text start="608.97" dur="5.84">now but the majority is not from the</text>
  <text start="611.43" dur="7.47">retail investor and we see right now</text>
  <text start="614.81" dur="7.15">their push right now is to get rid of</text>
  <text start="618.9" dur="4.29">cash they want to get rid of cash they</text>
  <text start="621.96" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t want people to take out their</text>
  <text start="623.19" dur="5.25">funds physically because they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="625.98" dur="5.7">worried about what is going to happen</text>
  <text start="628.44" dur="5.1">during the crisis where people are going</text>
  <text start="631.68" dur="4.61">to run and try to take their funds out</text>
  <text start="633.54" dur="6.36">of the bank and we see out in England</text>
  <text start="636.29" dur="7.15">with the ftse100 soaring to new record</text>
  <text start="639.9" dur="6.15">high just like the Dow well the people</text>
  <text start="643.44" dur="6.09">in England well they&amp;#39;re holding on to</text>
  <text start="646.05" dur="6.84">their cash because they&amp;#39;re worried</text>
  <text start="649.53" dur="7.17">they&amp;#39;re hunkering down because they</text>
  <text start="652.89" dur="7.73">realize that this is not going to last</text>
  <text start="656.7" dur="6.42">what&amp;#39;s whatsoever personal deposits grew</text>
  <text start="660.62" dur="5.59">at an annual rate of four point eight</text>
  <text start="663.12" dur="5.91">percent in November and they increased</text>
