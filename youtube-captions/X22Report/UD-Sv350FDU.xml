  <text start="49.39" dur="5.25">hi and welcome you listening to the x-22</text>
  <text start="53.079" dur="4.921">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="54.64" dur="6.03">episode 1240 2b and today&amp;#39;s date is</text>
  <text start="58" dur="4.92">March 30th 2017 and the title of the</text>
  <text start="60.67" dur="3.959">episode is the deep state has done it</text>
  <text start="62.92" dur="4.949">agenda will likely be revealed in the</text>
  <text start="64.629" dur="5.731">next couple of weeks let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="67.869" dur="5.221">economic collapse political energy of</text>
  <text start="70.36" dur="7.08">political news now Trump is still having</text>
  <text start="73.09" dur="6.84">problems with his travel ban and we see</text>
  <text start="77.44" dur="5.01">the US District Court Judge Derek Watson</text>
  <text start="79.93" dur="4.799">in Hawaii well he indefinitely blocked</text>
  <text start="82.45" dur="4.41">Trump&amp;#39;s revised travel ban that he</text>
  <text start="84.729" dur="4.161">temporarily halted on March 15th</text>
  <text start="86.86" dur="4.259">the initial order read that the band</text>
  <text start="88.89" dur="3.64">discriminates against residents on the</text>
  <text start="91.119" dur="3.541">basis of their religion and violates</text>
  <text start="92.53" dur="3.54">their rights and their due process and</text>
  <text start="94.66" dur="3.599">equal protection guarantee by the US</text>
  <text start="96.07" dur="3.9">Constitution Watson&amp;#39;s decision was</text>
  <text start="98.259" dur="3.871">supported by federal judge of Maryland</text>
  <text start="99.97" dur="4.17">and we can see right now that Trump is</text>
  <text start="102.13" dur="3.96">out there and he&amp;#39;s very angry with the</text>
  <text start="104.14" dur="3.69">judge and he said that this was</text>
  <text start="106.09" dur="3.449">unprecedented a judicial overreach</text>
  <text start="107.83" dur="3.209">citing the section of the US</text>
  <text start="109.539" dur="4.08">Constitution that gives the president</text>
  <text start="111.039" dur="5.431">executive authority to suspend the entry</text>
  <text start="113.619" dur="5.131">of aliens but again these individuals</text>
  <text start="116.47" dur="4.98">they don&amp;#39;t care about law they just are</text>
  <text start="118.75" dur="5.28">pushing their agenda and we can see</text>
  <text start="121.45" dur="4.47">right now that things are really heating</text>
  <text start="124.03" dur="5.399">up within the Trump administration we</text>
  <text start="125.92" dur="6.06">see Katie Walsh who was allegedly</text>
  <text start="129.429" dur="5.941">leaking all the information within the</text>
  <text start="131.98" dur="5.09">administration out to reporters and we</text>
  <text start="135.37" dur="5.97">can see right now that she is now</text>
  <text start="137.07" dur="6.46">leaving the White House to work outside</text>
  <text start="141.34" dur="3.989">of the White House but still for Trump</text>
  <text start="143.53" dur="5.37">so it looks like they came to an</text>
  <text start="145.329" dur="5.701">understanding and he gave her a job and</text>
  <text start="148.9" dur="4.41">we can see right now that things are</text>
  <text start="151.03" dur="4.44">definitely changing within the</text>
  <text start="153.31" dur="4.41">administration right now now yesterday</text>
  <text start="155.47" dur="5.579">we talked about Evelyn Farkas who</text>
  <text start="157.72" dur="7.17">admitted to mica that the Obama</text>
  <text start="161.049" dur="6.091">administration was surveilling Trump now</text>
  <text start="164.89" dur="6">the funny thing about all of this is</text>
  <text start="167.14" dur="5.64">that Farkas wasn&amp;#39;t employed by the Obama</text>
  <text start="170.89" dur="4.14">administration at the time the Russian</text>
  <text start="172.78" dur="4.88">allegations arose according to Pentagon</text>
  <text start="175.03" dur="6.48">records Farkas resigned in September of</text>
  <text start="177.66" dur="5.58">2015 so how did this non-resident fellow</text>
  <text start="181.51" dur="4.16">at the Atlantic Council member the</text>
  <text start="183.24" dur="3.66">Council on Foreign Relations and former</text>
  <text start="185.67" dur="4.14">Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense</text>
  <text start="186.9" dur="5.79">for Russia Ukraine and Eurasia gain</text>
  <text start="189.81" dur="5.43">knowledge of intelligence regarding</text>
  <text start="192.69" dur="5.58">members of trumps team and their</text>
  <text start="195.24" dur="5.1">relations with Russia when she was the</text>
  <text start="198.27" dur="4.88">senior foreign policy adviser for</text>
  <text start="200.34" dur="5.7">presidential candidate Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="203.15" dur="5.14">now Farkas was the prime driver behind</text>
  <text start="206.04" dur="5.85">the anti Russia phobia inside the</text>
  <text start="208.29" dur="6.06">Pentagon during the Obama years shilling</text>
  <text start="211.89" dur="4.86">hard for Ukraine requesting that the</text>
  <text start="214.35" dur="3.92">president send them anti-tank missiles</text>
  <text start="216.75" dur="5.04">which essentially would mean our</text>
  <text start="218.27" dur="5.97">outright war with Russia so this is all</text>
  <text start="221.79" dur="6.12">very interesting so we can see right now</text>
  <text start="224.24" dur="6.73">everything is connected now the New York</text>
  <text start="227.91" dur="5.34">Times is out there and there allegedly</text>
  <text start="230.97" dur="5.37">saying that we know who the leakers are</text>
  <text start="233.25" dur="6.03">we know the sources of newness and they</text>
  <text start="236.34" dur="4.5">claim that the sources are Ezra Cohen</text>
  <text start="239.28" dur="2.73">watt Nick the senior director for</text>
  <text start="240.84" dur="4.32">intelligence at the National Security</text>
  <text start="242.01" dur="5.43">Council and Michael Ellis a lawyer who</text>
  <text start="245.16" dur="3.63">works on national security issues at the</text>
  <text start="247.44" dur="3.09">White House counsel&amp;#39;s office and</text>
  <text start="248.79" dur="4.19">formerly worked on the staff of the</text>
  <text start="250.53" dur="6.269">House Intelligence Committee now</text>
  <text start="252.98" dur="6.22">amusingly the New York Times adds that</text>
  <text start="256.799" dur="5.581">the officials spoke on the condition of</text>
  <text start="259.2" dur="6.45">anonymity to describe the intelligence</text>
  <text start="262.38" dur="7.08">and to avoid angering mr. Cohen what</text>
  <text start="265.65" dur="6.96">Nick and mr. Ellis so in other words the</text>
  <text start="269.46" dur="6.45">u.s. has devolved to the point where one</text>
  <text start="272.61" dur="6.15">set of anonymous sources is daxing</text>
  <text start="275.91" dur="5.85">another set of anonymous sources in the</text>
  <text start="278.76" dur="6.29">pursuit of a political agenda I mean</text>
  <text start="281.76" dur="7.23">look what is going on here it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.05" dur="6.82">unbelievable now Putin was giving a</text>
  <text start="288.99" dur="7.38">speech at the Arctic forum and a</text>
  <text start="291.87" dur="6.03">reporter from CNBC Jeff cut more well he</text>
  <text start="296.37" dur="5.04">came up to Pune and asked a question</text>
  <text start="297.9" dur="5.97">about political interference human</text>
  <text start="301.41" dur="6.36">rights and the recent protests in Moscow</text>
  <text start="303.87" dur="5.88">and Putin well it looks like he wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="307.77" dur="4.8">really impressed with this reporter and</text>
  <text start="309.75" dur="5.43">he went on to say we keep talking about</text>
  <text start="312.57" dur="4.02">human rights all the time we talk about</text>
  <text start="315.18" dur="3.42">human rights</text>
  <text start="316.59" dur="5.01">you just mentioned those protests in</text>
  <text start="318.6" dur="5.58">Moscow and other cities in Russia and he</text>
  <text start="321.6" dur="4.89">went on to say but remember the West</text>
  <text start="324.18" dur="4.89">imposed sanctions on people who had</text>
  <text start="326.49" dur="5.28">nothing to do with Crimea they were not</text>
  <text start="329.07" dur="5.04">even involved they were not aware of the</text>
  <text start="331.77" dur="4.32">government&amp;#39;s plans they found out about</text>
  <text start="334.11" dur="4.59">this from the media and then they</text>
  <text start="336.09" dur="4.44">imposed sanctions on those peoples what</text>
  <text start="338.7" dur="3.72">about human rights they seized their</text>
  <text start="340.53" dur="3.39">accounts they can no longer use their</text>
  <text start="342.42" dur="3.75">money to take care of their families and</text>
  <text start="343.92" dur="2.91">he went on to say so what are you even</text>
  <text start="346.17" dur="3.39">talking about</text>
  <text start="346.83" dur="4.32">how can you talk about human rights so</text>
  <text start="349.56" dur="3.51">you want to have human rights in some</text>
  <text start="351.15" dur="4.74">cases and then you don&amp;#39;t want to have</text>
  <text start="353.07" dur="4.23">human rights for other people he says</text>
  <text start="355.89" dur="4.11">this makes no sense whatsoever</text>
  <text start="357.3" dur="6.33">look at other areas around the world</text>
  <text start="360" dur="7.65">where the United States is bombing in</text>
  <text start="363.63" dur="7.14">certain areas where they know there are</text>
  <text start="367.65" dur="6.03">families there&amp;#39;s infrastructure they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="370.77" dur="5.34">sanctioning countries not just the</text>
  <text start="373.68" dur="5.34">government but the people of the country</text>
  <text start="376.11" dur="5.79">and they are starving they&amp;#39;re having</text>
  <text start="379.02" dur="5.79">regime change in the countries around</text>
  <text start="381.9" dur="6.5">the Middle East where there&amp;#39;s constant</text>
  <text start="384.81" dur="7.38">war the economy is a disaster and</text>
  <text start="388.4" dur="5.05">there&amp;#39;s a humanitarian problem so if we</text>
  <text start="392.19" dur="4.41">really want to talk about human rights</text>
  <text start="393.45" dur="5.61">we should talk about human rights all</text>
  <text start="396.6" dur="5.07">over the place and what each country is</text>
  <text start="399.06" dur="5.07">doing now the Pentagon is out there and</text>
  <text start="401.67" dur="6.57">they&amp;#39;re insisting that we need more</text>
  <text start="404.13" dur="6.51">troops to counter Russia in Europe and</text>
  <text start="408.24" dur="5.43">what they&amp;#39;re saying is that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="410.64" dur="4.08">have enough assets we don&amp;#39;t have enough</text>
  <text start="413.67" dur="3.93">ground troops</text>
  <text start="414.72" dur="5.7">we don&amp;#39;t have an F sea based assets</text>
  <text start="417.6" dur="6.95">closer to Russia and we need more of it</text>
  <text start="420.42" dur="7.59">now the u.s. is refusing to take part in</text>
  <text start="424.55" dur="6.13">meetings on Afghanistan now Washington</text>
  <text start="428.01" dur="4.47">said we are not going to attend on April</text>
  <text start="430.68" dur="5.07">14th where we&amp;#39;re going to have this</text>
  <text start="432.48" dur="4.11">meeting in Moscow about Afghanistan now</text>
  <text start="435.75" dur="2.82">they were going to talk about the</text>
  <text start="436.59" dur="4.38">security situation in Afghanistan and</text>
  <text start="438.57" dur="4.08">further prospects for its development</text>
  <text start="440.97" dur="4.08">will be discussed during the talks the</text>
  <text start="442.65" dur="4.29">key objective of this event is hammering</text>
  <text start="445.05" dur="4.07">out a single regional approach regarding</text>
  <text start="446.94" dur="4.34">efforts to further promote the</text>
  <text start="449.12" dur="3.78">national reconciliation process in that</text>
  <text start="451.28" dur="3.78">country while maintaining Kabul&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="452.9" dur="4.079">leadership role and adhering to the</text>
  <text start="455.06" dur="4.26">principles of integrating the armed</text>
  <text start="456.979" dur="5.761">opposition into peaceful life discussed</text>
  <text start="459.32" dur="6.99">and approved earlier so they want to</text>
  <text start="462.74" dur="6.54">talk about peace in this area and the us</text>
  <text start="466.31" dur="4.68">once again is saying that we are not</text>
  <text start="469.28" dur="3.72">going to take part of this because the</text>
  <text start="470.99" dur="4.649">deep state the neocons they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="473" dur="5.43">to have anything to do with peace if</text>
  <text start="475.639" dur="4.881">they&amp;#39;re not getting their way and this</text>
  <text start="478.43" dur="5.25">is why they always turn toward</text>
  <text start="480.52" dur="5.89">ultimatums if you don&amp;#39;t do it our way</text>
  <text start="483.68" dur="4.35">there&amp;#39;ll be no peace and they go on to</text>
  <text start="486.41" dur="3.81">the corporate media they tell the world</text>
  <text start="488.03" dur="5.34">we tried they didn&amp;#39;t want to go along</text>
  <text start="490.22" dur="5.79">with what we said they objected to what</text>
  <text start="493.37" dur="6.57">we offered them well that&amp;#39;s not peace</text>
  <text start="496.01" dur="6.81">that is not discussing the issues that</text>
  <text start="499.94" dur="5.19">is not having a conversation that is</text>
  <text start="502.82" dur="4.319">giving someone a choice and if they</text>
  <text start="505.13" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t go along with your choice you say</text>
  <text start="507.139" dur="6.001">we tried now we see that the US has</text>
  <text start="509.63" dur="6.599">dropped about 500 bombs per week on</text>
  <text start="513.14" dur="4.769">misil and now we can understand why</text>
  <text start="516.229" dur="3.93">there is so much infrastructure damage</text>
  <text start="517.909" dur="4.021">now we can understand why there are so</text>
  <text start="520.159" dur="4.68">many civilians that have died there and</text>
  <text start="521.93" dur="7.38">we can see right now that the number is</text>
  <text start="524.839" dur="8.671">growing and the u.s. is planning to drop</text>
  <text start="529.31" dur="6.149">even more bumps in this entire area now</text>
  <text start="533.51" dur="4.829">turkey is out there and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="535.459" dur="5.791">that they have completed operation</text>
  <text start="538.339" dur="4.681">Euphrates shield and this doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="541.25" dur="4.11">that they&amp;#39;re leaving it doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="543.02" dur="4.83">that they&amp;#39;re withdrawing their troops</text>
  <text start="545.36" dur="4.5">what it means is they finish with that</text>
  <text start="547.85" dur="3.69">operation now they&amp;#39;re restarting a</text>
  <text start="549.86" dur="4.14">different operation under a different</text>
  <text start="551.54" dur="4.739">name so it looks like they&amp;#39;re pushing on</text>
  <text start="554" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re just renaming it to make it look</text>
  <text start="556.279" dur="4.351">like we&amp;#39;re on to something different</text>
  <text start="558.02" dur="4.74">which they aren&amp;#39;t they&amp;#39;re on to the same</text>
  <text start="560.63" dur="4.44">exact thing now it looks like there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="562.76" dur="4.89">little bit of fake news out there and</text>
  <text start="565.07" dur="5.04">there was a picture that was posted that</text>
  <text start="567.65" dur="5.55">Russian warships have caliber cruise</text>
  <text start="570.11" dur="5.88">missiles and they fired them against</text>
  <text start="573.2" dur="5.1">unknown targets in Syria from the port</text>
  <text start="575.99" dur="4.29">of Tartus and they showed the picture of</text>
  <text start="578.3" dur="4.289">the missiles flying over and it looks</text>
  <text start="580.28" dur="2.64">like it&amp;#39;s right on the port but this was</text>
  <text start="582.589" dur="2.911">take</text>
  <text start="582.92" dur="5.28">from a video which was released in 2016</text>
  <text start="585.5" dur="4.95">and they just photoshopped it into this</text>
  <text start="588.2" dur="3.96">new photo and you can see what the</text>
  <text start="590.45" dur="3.389">Photoshop looks like and what the</text>
  <text start="592.16" dur="5.4">original looks like and it looks like</text>
  <text start="593.839" dur="7.141">someone is pushing around fake news once</text>
  <text start="597.56" dur="7.079">again we see right now that Tillerson is</text>
  <text start="600.98" dur="5.31">out there and he is saying and this is a</text>
  <text start="604.639" dur="4.32">complete switch of what they were saying</text>
  <text start="606.29" dur="5.46">all along that they&amp;#39;re going to let the</text>
  <text start="608.959" dur="5.611">Syrian people decide if Assad should</text>
  <text start="611.75" dur="5.16">stay or go now Russia has been saying</text>
  <text start="614.57" dur="4.139">this for quite a while we see that Rex</text>
  <text start="616.91" dur="5.039">Tillerson who is the US Secretary of</text>
  <text start="618.709" dur="6.12">State he is also showing a complete</text>
  <text start="621.949" dur="5.851">shift of US policy now it sounds really</text>
  <text start="624.829" dur="5.221">great doesn&amp;#39;t it it sounds like wow the</text>
  <text start="627.8" dur="4.02">Trump administration they&amp;#39;re changing</text>
  <text start="630.05" dur="4.8">things up they&amp;#39;re going along with</text>
  <text start="631.82" dur="5.49">Russia and Assad can stay and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="634.85" dur="3.989">gonna let the elections happen now</text>
  <text start="637.31" dur="2.79">that&amp;#39;s not what&amp;#39;s happening they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="638.839" dur="3.481">care about Assad anymore</text>
  <text start="640.1" dur="4.2">because remember what we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="642.32" dur="4.129">about how their balkanized in Syria</text>
  <text start="644.3" dur="4.74">well they&amp;#39;ve started the process and</text>
  <text start="646.449" dur="4.271">remember when we talked about these safe</text>
  <text start="649.04" dur="3.539">zones where the US was completely</text>
  <text start="650.72" dur="3.66">against it during the Obama</text>
  <text start="652.579" dur="4.021">administration were they really against</text>
  <text start="654.38" dur="3.6">it no they just didn&amp;#39;t have the ability</text>
  <text start="656.6" dur="4.62">to do it at that point in time</text>
  <text start="657.98" dur="5.88">now that Turkey finished its Euphrates</text>
  <text start="661.22" dur="5.489">shield they carved out the area that</text>
  <text start="663.86" dur="6.03">they needed and we can see that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="666.709" dur="5.94">now has the bases built they have the</text>

  <text start="827.66" dur="3.6">know all these companies decided that</text>
  <text start="829.1" dur="4.85">they&amp;#39;re gonna be boycotting YouTube</text>
  <text start="831.26" dur="5.79">because their ads are being placed on</text>
  <text start="833.95" dur="6.34">extremists videos offensive hate videos</text>
  <text start="837.05" dur="6.18">but we all need to understand that these</text>
  <text start="840.29" dur="6.29">type of videos well first of all they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="843.23" dur="6.09">demonetized right away YouTube has</text>
  <text start="846.58" dur="3.61">algorithms that already go out and</text>
  <text start="849.32" dur="3.09">search</text>
  <text start="850.19" dur="5.4">for certain keywords certain terms</text>
  <text start="852.41" dur="5.34">certain pictures and they understand and</text>
  <text start="855.59" dur="4.8">cross-reference the information remember</text>
  <text start="857.75" dur="4.8">when a YouTube video is made it is</text>
  <text start="860.39" dur="4.38">completely transcribed into English you</text>
  <text start="862.55" dur="4.26">can see it right on the YouTube site so</text>
  <text start="864.77" dur="4.32">they scan that and they get a picture of</text>
  <text start="866.81" dur="4.5">what you&amp;#39;re talking about and they</text>
  <text start="869.09" dur="4.95">already have the algorithms in place to</text>
  <text start="871.31" dur="3.84">remove the monetization of the extremest</text>
  <text start="874.04" dur="2.88">videos first of all those aren&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="875.15" dur="4.02">allowed on YouTube and if they are on</text>
  <text start="876.92" dur="4.28">they&amp;#39;re on for maybe a day and then</text>
  <text start="879.17" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re taking down hate videos</text>
  <text start="881.2" dur="4.75">offensive videos well first of all</text>
  <text start="882.92" dur="4.14">offensive is so broad we don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="885.95" dur="3.33">don&amp;#39;t even know what that means</text>
  <text start="887.06" dur="5.28">because what&amp;#39;s offensive to one person</text>
  <text start="889.28" dur="5.61">is not offensive to another and again if</text>
  <text start="892.34" dur="4.35">someone is cursing well it&amp;#39;s scanned in</text>
  <text start="894.89" dur="2.85">the transcription and they understand</text>
  <text start="896.69" dur="2.01">that someone is cursing but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="897.74" dur="3.12">think the corporate media is too</text>
  <text start="898.7" dur="4.2">concerned about that because as we can</text>
  <text start="900.86" dur="3.9">see in movie theaters they play their</text>
  <text start="902.9" dur="4.08">advertisements before movies that are</text>
  <text start="904.76" dur="3.87">r-rated and there&amp;#39;s cursing in those</text>
  <text start="906.98" dur="3.51">movies so I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re really</text>

  <text start="925.81" dur="3.37">transcription</text>
  <text start="926.93" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;ll de monetize it right away so I</text>
  <text start="929.18" dur="4.74">don&amp;#39;t think the corporate media right</text>
  <text start="931.07" dur="5.36">now is boycotting that because again</text>

  <text start="952.82" dur="4.26">the alternative media might have helped</text>

  <text start="1094.809" dur="8.941">plan they want control and they&amp;#39;ve tried</text>
  <text start="1099.72" dur="5.92">many times before to get rid of these</text>

  <text start="1119.86" dur="3.569">natural news down off of Google search</text>
  <text start="1121.929" dur="3.36">but they had to bring them back up</text>
  <text start="1123.429" dur="4.11">because they had no reason to bring it</text>
  <text start="1125.289" dur="3.841">down so they finally figured out a way</text>
