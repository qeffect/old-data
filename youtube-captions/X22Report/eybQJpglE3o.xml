  <text start="63.18" dur="5.4">and the title of the episode is Europe</text>
  <text start="65.94" dur="6">short on dollars this could trigger a</text>
  <text start="68.58" dur="5.94">liquidity crisis let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="71.94" dur="5.52">economic collapse financial news now the</text>
  <text start="74.52" dur="4.92">central bankers they have been pushing</text>
  <text start="77.46" dur="4.35">their illusion like they&amp;#39;ve always done</text>
  <text start="79.44" dur="4.26">in the past that the economy is doing</text>
  <text start="81.81" dur="4.11">well and there are no problems</text>
  <text start="83.7" dur="5.21">whatsoever we&amp;#39;re seeing no signs of</text>
  <text start="85.92" dur="5.309">recession employment growth is strong</text>
  <text start="88.91" dur="5.22">jobless claims are low and the stock</text>
  <text start="91.229" dur="8.491">market is up we hear this all the time</text>
  <text start="94.13" dur="9.25">it&amp;#39;s happening every single day since</text>
  <text start="99.72" dur="7.23">2008 and they continually tell us that</text>
  <text start="103.38" dur="5.37">things are going to get a lot better we</text>
  <text start="106.95" dur="3.48">also see the corporate media now</text>
  <text start="108.75" dur="5.1">starting to turn because Trump is</text>
  <text start="110.43" dur="5.79">putting forth his economic policies and</text>
  <text start="113.85" dur="5.189">we are starting to see that things are</text>
  <text start="116.22" dur="5.22">starting to change now the corporate</text>
  <text start="119.039" dur="4.021">media and the Fed they were out there</text>
  <text start="121.44" dur="4.14">and the government they were out there</text>
  <text start="123.06" dur="7.38">saying that the US economy has been</text>
  <text start="125.58" dur="7.02">growing by 2% and since it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="130.44" dur="4.77">growing at 2% how could we have a</text>
  <text start="132.6" dur="5.46">recession anytime soon well if you look</text>
  <text start="135.21" dur="6.78">back in time we can see that January of</text>
  <text start="138.06" dur="9.18">1980 the US economy grew by one point</text>
  <text start="141.99" dur="11.63">four four three percent July 1981 4.3 9%</text>
  <text start="147.24" dur="10.44">July 1990 1.7 3% March 2001 2.3 0%</text>
  <text start="153.62" dur="6.52">December 2007 1.8 7% if you look at each</text>
  <text start="157.68" dur="5.04">of those dates the economy was clearly</text>
  <text start="160.14" dur="4.13">clearly growing but each of those dates</text>
  <text start="162.72" dur="5.01">is the growth rate of the economy</text>
  <text start="164.27" dur="5.71">immediately prior to the onset of a</text>
  <text start="167.73" dur="6.63">recession and if you remember in the</text>
  <text start="169.98" dur="6.9">year 2000 the media analysts the</text>
  <text start="174.36" dur="4.23">economic community they are all out</text>
  <text start="176.88" dur="5.31">there saying listen the economic growth</text>
  <text start="178.59" dur="5.81">it&amp;#39;s not gonna decline we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="182.19" dur="4.2">growth into the foreseeable future</text>
  <text start="184.4" dur="4.99">there&amp;#39;s no signs what</text>
  <text start="186.39" dur="5.22">so ever of any type of recession and</text>
  <text start="189.39" dur="4.44">they kept on saying this over and over</text>
  <text start="191.61" dur="7.16">and over of course</text>
  <text start="193.83" dur="8.94">one year later what did we see we saw a</text>
  <text start="198.77" dur="10.3">recession and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right</text>
  <text start="202.77" dur="9.57">now is that they continually keep us in</text>
  <text start="209.07" dur="5.52">this illusion they don&amp;#39;t let on to what</text>
  <text start="212.34" dur="4.83">is going on they don&amp;#39;t want you to know</text>
  <text start="214.59" dur="5.7">what&amp;#39;s going on until the very end and</text>
  <text start="217.17" dur="7.11">of course what they do is they go back</text>
  <text start="220.29" dur="5.729">in time a full year later after the</text>
  <text start="224.28" dur="4.02">annual data revisions had been released</text>
  <text start="226.019" dur="5.671">by the B ei the Bureau of Economic</text>
  <text start="228.3" dur="5.96">Analysis the recession was officially</text>
  <text start="231.69" dur="5.24">revealed but of course it&amp;#39;s too late</text>
  <text start="234.26" dur="4.69">we&amp;#39;re already in the recession and</text>
  <text start="236.93" dur="4.99">they&amp;#39;re just telling us what we already</text>
  <text start="238.95" dur="5.49">know they always tell us at the back end</text>
  <text start="241.92" dur="5.61">oh yeah by the way this is when it</text>
  <text start="244.44" dur="5.88">really started and we&amp;#39;ve learned</text>
  <text start="247.53" dur="5.28">something from all of this by looking at</text>
  <text start="250.32" dur="5.97">the past and looking at what is</text>
  <text start="252.81" dur="5.31">happening today we know three things the</text>
  <text start="256.29" dur="3.509">economic number reported today will not</text>
  <text start="258.12" dur="5.1">be the same when it is when it is</text>
  <text start="259.799" dur="5.761">revised in the future the trend and</text>
  <text start="263.22" dur="5.13">deviation of the data are far more</text>
  <text start="265.56" dur="5.7">important than a number itself record</text>
  <text start="268.35" dur="5.25">highs and lows are records for a reason</text>
  <text start="271.26" dur="4.8">as they denote historical turning points</text>
  <text start="273.6" dur="5.61">in the data let&amp;#39;s look at jobless claims</text>
  <text start="276.06" dur="6.18">for instance this is a data series</text>
  <text start="279.21" dur="5.61">currently being touted out there that</text>
  <text start="282.24" dur="4.65">Wow the job market is incredible it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="284.82" dur="3.54">the lowest Woo&amp;#39;s ever seen there is no</text>
  <text start="286.89" dur="5.52">recession whatsoever and they show this</text>
  <text start="288.36" dur="6.63">graph showing 2008-2009 all the way up</text>
  <text start="292.41" dur="5.4">to today where the trend line is</text>
  <text start="294.99" dur="5.79">declining and it&amp;#39;s showing that yo we</text>
  <text start="297.81" dur="4.89">were at you know 10% unemployment and</text>
  <text start="300.78" dur="3.15">now we&amp;#39;re down at 4.1 percent they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="302.7" dur="1.68">gonna say it&amp;#39;s gonna go even lower than</text>
  <text start="303.93" dur="4.859">that</text>
  <text start="304.38" dur="7.349">but if you back up a little bit and you</text>
  <text start="308.789" dur="6.571">open up the graph go them all the way</text>
  <text start="311.729" dur="7.411">back to 1967 you can see that there is</text>
  <text start="315.36" dur="4.98">definitely a trend that each time</text>
  <text start="319.14" dur="4.71">unemployment</text>
  <text start="320.34" dur="6.51">reaches a very very low level we enter a</text>
  <text start="323.85" dur="8.819">recession or a depression this has</text>
  <text start="326.85" dur="9.65">happened in 1971 in 1974 this has</text>
  <text start="332.669" dur="9.211">happened in 1982 this has happened in</text>
  <text start="336.5" dur="9.58">1990 this has happened in 2001 2000 2001</text>
  <text start="341.88" dur="11.67">this has happened in 2007 2008 and we</text>
  <text start="346.08" dur="12.36">are at the lowest point since 1974 maybe</text>
  <text start="353.55" dur="8.24">even 71 right now and this tells us this</text>
  <text start="358.44" dur="5.21">next crash it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot worse</text>
  <text start="361.79" dur="4.599">than before</text>
  <text start="363.65" dur="5.8">then if we go and we look at retail</text>
  <text start="366.389" dur="5.611">sales over the last few months we can</text>
  <text start="369.45" dur="6.36">see that well retail sales they are not</text>
  <text start="372" dur="6.6">doing well they have this cycle that</text>
  <text start="375.81" dur="6.63">goes up and down and we can see right</text>
  <text start="378.6" dur="7.77">now we are in a downward trend we were</text>
  <text start="382.44" dur="6.949">in a downward trend starting in 2006</text>
  <text start="386.37" dur="5.76">going into 2007 it picked up speed in</text>
  <text start="389.389" dur="5.321">2008 and it was a complete disaster if</text>
  <text start="392.13" dur="5.37">we go back to 2000 that&amp;#39;s when the</text>
  <text start="394.71" dur="5.25">downward trend in retail started then in</text>
  <text start="397.5" dur="7.68">2001 it declined we entered a recession</text>
  <text start="399.96" dur="8.84">here we are again in 2017 I mean 2018</text>
  <text start="405.18" dur="6.63">and we see the same exact trend we are</text>
  <text start="408.8" dur="4.299">declining right now the same thing has</text>
  <text start="411.81" dur="5.43">happened in the past there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="413.099" dur="8.161">difference the only difference is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="417.24" dur="7.2">much worse off because they have created</text>
  <text start="421.26" dur="5.73">this illusion the other interesting</text>
  <text start="424.44" dur="5.01">aspect of this is the rise in consumer</text>
  <text start="426.99" dur="5.07">credit as a percent of disposable</text>
  <text start="429.45" dur="5.49">personal income what is interesting to</text>
  <text start="432.06" dur="7.31">note is the rising level of credit card</text>
  <text start="434.94" dur="7.8">debt required to sustain retail sales so</text>
  <text start="439.37" dur="7.21">basically more people have to use credit</text>
  <text start="442.74" dur="6.78">just to keep retail where it is which</text>
  <text start="446.58" dur="6.149">tells you something so we have low</text>
  <text start="449.52" dur="4.619">jobless claims retail sales remaining</text>
  <text start="452.729" dur="4.41">exceptionally weak</text>
  <text start="454.139" dur="5.671">there are two reasons for this which are</text>
  <text start="457.139" dur="4.62">continually overlooked the first is that</text>
  <text start="459.81" dur="4.109">despite the longest run of unemployment</text>
  <text start="461.759" dur="4.731">growth in US history those who are</text>
  <text start="463.919" dur="4.921">finding jobs continues to grow at a</text>
  <text start="466.49" dur="6.459">substantially slower pace than the</text>
  <text start="468.84" dur="6.389">growth rate of the population if you</text>
  <text start="472.949" dur="4.291">don&amp;#39;t have a job and a primary living</text>
  <text start="475.229" dur="5.011">and primarily living on the government</text>
  <text start="477.24" dur="4.709">support which by the way is one of four</text>
  <text start="480.24" dur="4.53">Americans receive some form of benefit</text>
  <text start="481.949" dur="4.911">it is difficult to consume at higher</text>
  <text start="484.77" dur="4.59">levels to support economic growth</text>
  <text start="486.86" dur="5.859">secondly while tax cuts may provide a</text>
  <text start="489.36" dur="6.089">temporary boost to after-tax incomes the</text>
  <text start="492.719" dur="5.13">income boost is simply being absorbed by</text>
  <text start="495.449" dur="5.25">the higher energy gasoline healthcare</text>
  <text start="497.849" dur="4.981">borrowing costs this is why 80% of</text>
  <text start="500.699" dur="4.291">Americans continue to live paycheck to</text>
  <text start="502.83" dur="4.98">paycheck and have little saved in the</text>
  <text start="504.99" dur="5.31">bank it is also why wages have continued</text>
  <text start="507.81" dur="5.519">to stagnate the cost of living now</text>
  <text start="510.3" dur="6.599">exceeds what incomes and debt increases</text>
  <text start="513.329" dur="8.19">can sustain so when we look at this we</text>
  <text start="516.899" dur="8.43">can see that this pattern we have seen</text>
  <text start="521.519" dur="8.161">this pattern over and over and over</text>
  <text start="525.329" dur="8.551">again this time it&amp;#39;s not different this</text>
  <text start="529.68" dur="7.43">time it&amp;#39;s exactly the same plus they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="533.88" dur="7.56">created an illusion that&amp;#39;s much worse</text>
  <text start="537.11" dur="6.909">than past recessions because we never</text>
  <text start="541.44" dur="6.93">really came out of the 2008 Great</text>
  <text start="544.019" dur="7.471">Recession all they did was extend it for</text>
  <text start="548.37" dur="6.81">seven years and when it crashes and when</text>
  <text start="551.49" dur="5.49">all the manipulation is exposed and the</text>
  <text start="555.18" dur="3.57">domino effect takes effect when the</text>
  <text start="556.98" dur="3.84">derivative market completely breaks down</text>
  <text start="558.75" dur="4.05">and everything starts to fall apart and</text>
  <text start="560.82" dur="5.19">we find out the banks are completely</text>
  <text start="562.8" dur="5.039">insolvent well it&amp;#39;s going to be a pretty</text>
  <text start="566.01" dur="5.06">darn scary for many many people</text>
  <text start="567.839" dur="6.901">now Wall Street is out there and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="571.07" dur="7.12">expecting the global growth to turn</text>
  <text start="574.74" dur="5.82">bearish and they&amp;#39;re saying that they</text>
  <text start="578.19" dur="4.92">don&amp;#39;t think global growth is going to</text>
  <text start="580.56" dur="4.259">continue on they&amp;#39;re thinking that things</text>
  <text start="583.11" dur="4.74">are going to start turning downward it</text>
  <text start="584.819" dur="5.82">looks like Wall Street</text>
  <text start="587.85" dur="4.229">the central banking system certain</text>
  <text start="590.639" dur="4.291">governments who want their goal back</text>
  <text start="592.079" dur="5.49">like hungry they&amp;#39;re all preparing for</text>
  <text start="594.93" dur="5.55">something much much larger than we are</text>
  <text start="597.569" dur="7.471">being told which I do believe is the</text>
  <text start="600.48" dur="5.88">downturn of the economic system the</text>
  <text start="605.04" dur="4.82">other thing that is happening right now</text>
  <text start="606.36" dur="6.959">is that Europe is running out of dollars</text>
  <text start="609.86" dur="6.099">now the European inter-bank market is</text>
  <text start="613.319" dur="5.13">going through the biggest shortage of</text>
  <text start="615.959" dur="6.841">u.s. dollar liquidity in nearly nine</text>
  <text start="618.449" dur="7.711">years now they&amp;#39;re saying this is because</text>
  <text start="622.8" dur="4.89">of US tax reform it this may be behind</text>
  <text start="626.16" dur="5.28">the largest deficit since the financial</text>
  <text start="627.69" dur="6.93">crisis European lenders they are short</text>
  <text start="631.44" dur="5.25">of dollar liquidity according to Rui</text>
  <text start="634.62" dur="5.579">facin Bank the analyst stress that the</text>
  <text start="636.69" dur="7.019">US currency is moving back home and that</text>
  <text start="640.199" dur="5.76">is causing the deficit global growth</text>
  <text start="643.709" dur="6.601">rates of monetary supply have dropped to</text>
  <text start="645.959" dur="6.271">a minimum level since 2007 now analysts</text>
  <text start="650.31" dur="4.73">are out there and they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="652.23" dur="6.539">the limited availability of dollars</text>
  <text start="655.04" dur="5.59">might trigger a new liquidity crisis</text>
  <text start="658.769" dur="4.82">which can be followed by a systemic</text>
  <text start="660.63" dur="5.91">financial crisis and a global recession</text>
  <text start="663.589" dur="5.98">now think about what is happening right</text>
  <text start="666.54" dur="4.649">now they&amp;#39;re saying that dollars are</text>
  <text start="669.569" dur="4.741">being recalled back to United States</text>
  <text start="671.189" dur="6.871">well yes they are because Trump right</text>
  <text start="674.31" dur="6.93">now is having corporations bring these</text>
  <text start="678.06" dur="5.82">dollars back to the United States we</text>
  <text start="681.24" dur="5.099">also understand that the petro dollar</text>
  <text start="683.88" dur="3.99">system is dying and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="686.339" dur="5">countries that are dumping the dollar</text>
  <text start="687.87" dur="5.55">and we can see out throughout the world</text>
  <text start="691.339" dur="3.821">dollars are heading back to the United</text>
  <text start="693.42" dur="4.14">States now when this happens we are</text>
  <text start="695.16" dur="4.5">going to see hyperinflation here but</text>
  <text start="697.56" dur="5.1">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all of</text>
  <text start="699.66" dur="4.919">this and this follows what we were</text>
  <text start="702.66" dur="6.5">talking about yesterday in the report</text>
  <text start="704.579" dur="7.95">where the tax cuts where the tariffs</text>
  <text start="709.16" dur="7.029">with the debt which we&amp;#39;ve reached 21</text>
  <text start="712.529" dur="5.401">trillion with the central bank pushing</text>
  <text start="716.189" dur="5.101">interest rates higher remember there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="717.93" dur="5.209">battle going on right now Trump I do</text>
  <text start="721.29" dur="4.229">believe in the Patriots behind him and</text>
  <text start="723.139" dur="4.901">separately the central bank&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="725.519" dur="5.611">both trying to push their narrative of</text>
  <text start="728.04" dur="4.5">why the system has crashed they need you</text>
  <text start="731.13" dur="5.13">know someone to blame on they need to</text>
  <text start="732.54" dur="5.519">point a finger and Trump by recalling</text>
  <text start="736.26" dur="4.379">all those dollars from all those</text>
  <text start="738.059" dur="5.58">corporations that were moved overseas a</text>
  <text start="740.639" dur="4.741">lot of corporations keep their cash</text>
  <text start="743.639" dur="4.5">hoard overseas because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="745.38" dur="4.949">to be taxed Trump has removed a lot of</text>
  <text start="748.139" dur="4.021">this and a lot of companies are starting</text>
  <text start="750.329" dur="4.681">to bring the cash back here to the</text>
  <text start="752.16" dur="5.609">United States plus we have tariffs and</text>
  <text start="755.01" dur="8.429">and other tax cuts and things like that</text>
  <text start="757.769" dur="8.611">as you can see this is building right</text>
  <text start="763.439" dur="5.491">now and I think what he&amp;#39;s trying to do</text>
  <text start="766.38" dur="5.49">is he&amp;#39;s trying to bring the system down</text>
  <text start="768.93" dur="4.469">he wants to control the narrative this</text>
  <text start="771.87" dur="3.63">is why they&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s a cash</text>
  <text start="773.399" dur="4.68">shortage in Europe and this might</text>
  <text start="775.5" dur="4.699">trigger a new liquidity crisis which</text>
  <text start="778.079" dur="5.641">might be followed by a global recession</text>
  <text start="780.199" dur="6.851">now let&amp;#39;s look at this for a second here</text>
  <text start="783.72" dur="6.299">the globalist the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="787.05" dur="7.529">banks they were setting the entire</text>
  <text start="790.019" dur="6">system up for a globalist type of system</text>
  <text start="794.579" dur="4.56">a one world currency one world</text>
  <text start="796.019" dur="4.831">government type of system and they were</text>
  <text start="799.139" dur="4.17">doing this very slowly with NAFTA</text>
  <text start="800.85" dur="4.65">another World Trade Organization they</text>
  <text start="803.309" dur="2.76">were trying to push TPP and many other</text>
  <text start="805.5" dur="3.779">things</text>
  <text start="806.069" dur="8.041">this was their big big push it is being</text>
  <text start="809.279" dur="9.78">dismantled right now one organization</text>
  <text start="814.11" dur="6.63">one law at a time and as you do this the</text>
  <text start="819.059" dur="6.121">system&amp;#39;s going to start to break down</text>
  <text start="820.74" dur="5.819">and you need to bring it down in the way</text>
  <text start="825.18" dur="3.57">that you want you can&amp;#39;t just have it</text>
  <text start="826.559" dur="4.351">come down because then you can&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="828.75" dur="4.769">control that well not saying it can be</text>
  <text start="830.91" dur="5.34">controlled but you can create the</text>
  <text start="833.519" dur="5.101">narrative you can create the story of</text>
  <text start="836.25" dur="3.66">why this is happening the deep State the</text>
  <text start="838.62" dur="3.569">central bankers have been doing this for</text>
  <text start="839.91" dur="4.409">years trying to convince everyone</text>
  <text start="842.189" dur="3.571">it was never their fault they&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="844.319" dur="4.051">blamed it on something else because they</text>
  <text start="845.76" dur="4.919">had everything already set up so if you</text>
  <text start="848.37" dur="5.73">saw the subprime securities back in 2008</text>
  <text start="850.679" dur="6.78">that was a setup so they had something</text>
  <text start="854.1" dur="5.4">to blame all of this on the same thing</text>
  <text start="857.459" dur="3.93">with other recessions because this is</text>
  <text start="859.5" dur="3.449">how the central bankers work they make</text>
  <text start="861.389" dur="4.531">money on the way up and they make a lot</text>
  <text start="862.949" dur="5.76">more on the way down and we see right</text>
  <text start="865.92" dur="5.099">now the the the Trump administration the</text>
  <text start="868.709" dur="5.43">Patriots behind him realize what the</text>
  <text start="871.019" dur="5.101">central bank is doing they are raising</text>
  <text start="874.139" dur="3">the interest rates very very slowly and</text>
  <text start="876.12" dur="3.54">if you notice when he came into office</text>
  <text start="877.139" dur="5.791">they bumped it up like twice maybe three</text>
  <text start="879.66" dur="5.34">times while Obama was in office they</text>
  <text start="882.93" dur="3.899">really didn&amp;#39;t do that much and the</text>
  <text start="885" dur="4.05">reason for that is because they needed</text>
  <text start="886.829" dur="4.95">to start and they needed to start the</text>
  <text start="889.05" dur="5.899">push they started to unwind and the ECB</text>
  <text start="891.779" dur="6.93">starting to unwind so they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="894.949" dur="5.471">removing the juice from the economy they</text>
  <text start="898.709" dur="3.661">know when they do this and they raise</text>
  <text start="900.42" dur="2.789">interest rates it&amp;#39;s going to affect a</text>
  <text start="902.37" dur="3.149">lot of things</text>
  <text start="903.209" dur="4.86">student loans real estate all the loans</text>
  <text start="905.519" dur="5.281">they know these are the things that they</text>
  <text start="908.069" dur="5.551">were able to control if they can start a</text>
  <text start="910.8" dur="4.229">domino effect they can bring down the</text>
  <text start="913.62" dur="3.839">system which they know it will come down</text>
  <text start="915.029" dur="3.841">they know that they&amp;#39;ve been keeping it</text>
  <text start="917.459" dur="3.3">up they they know exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="918.87" dur="4.74">doing I mean the everyday person doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="920.759" dur="4.471">realize what&amp;#39;s happening Trump knows</text>
  <text start="923.61" dur="3.81">what&amp;#39;s going on the Patriots behind him</text>
  <text start="925.23" dur="4.83">know what&amp;#39;s going on and this is why I</text>
  <text start="927.42" dur="5.49">think he&amp;#39;s pushing this agenda what</text>
  <text start="930.06" dur="7.079">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is this huge push</text>
  <text start="932.91" dur="7.049">to gain the narrative of the whole</text>
  <text start="937.139" dur="7.31">economic structure to explain why this</text>
  <text start="939.959" dur="7.98">is happening now if Trump is able to</text>
  <text start="944.449" dur="6.841">convince the American people that it was</text>
  <text start="947.939" dur="7.411">the central bank that it was the</text>
  <text start="951.29" dur="5.979">globalists that did all of this how hard</text>
  <text start="955.35" dur="4.62">do you think it would be to push the</text>
  <text start="957.269" dur="4.44">bill to audit the Fed I think that would</text>
  <text start="959.97" dur="6.719">go right through with no problem</text>
  <text start="961.709" dur="7.5">whatsoever if that is then done and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="966.689" dur="4.59">able to audit the Fed and there is a</text>
  <text start="969.209" dur="4.951">group that&amp;#39;s already prepared and ready</text>
  <text start="971.279" dur="4.711">to go in there and audit the Fed what</text>
  <text start="974.16" dur="4.349">will they find which would then be</text>
  <text start="975.99" dur="5.13">presented to the American people which</text>
  <text start="978.509" dur="6.531">then would show that this organization</text>
  <text start="981.12" dur="6.84">this private corporation was not working</text>
  <text start="985.04" dur="5.62">for the people of you know</text>
  <text start="987.96" dur="5.13">States it wasn&amp;#39;t working for the people</text>
  <text start="990.66" dur="4.83">around the world they were working in</text>
  <text start="993.09" dur="5.22">their best interest and if they dig even</text>
  <text start="995.49" dur="6.78">deeper they will most likely find out</text>
  <text start="998.31" dur="7.8">they were funding the deep state covert</text>
  <text start="1002.27" dur="4.71">operations most of what we&amp;#39;re seeing was</text>
  <text start="1006.11" dur="2.7">a lie</text>
  <text start="1006.98" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating gold and</text>
  <text start="1008.81" dur="6.12">silver the finance system is a lot worse</text>
  <text start="1011.57" dur="10.29">than we even thought it was we we even</text>
  <text start="1014.93" dur="12.59">thought it was and this would give the</text>
  <text start="1021.86" dur="8.729">administration the power the people the</text>
  <text start="1027.52" dur="7.9">government officials the states to say</text>
  <text start="1030.589" dur="7.651">we don&amp;#39;t want the central bank and guess</text>
  <text start="1035.42" dur="6.72">what the central bank at this point in</text>
  <text start="1038.24" dur="7.74">time could be pushed out so we can see</text>
  <text start="1042.14" dur="7.05">how this could play out and how the</text>
  <text start="1045.98" dur="6.72">entire system right now is teetering on</text>
  <text start="1049.19" dur="6.3">the edge and again it&amp;#39;s not going to be</text>
  <text start="1052.7" dur="5.46">an easy period of time when the system</text>
  <text start="1055.49" dur="5.91">comes down because once you bring down a</text>
  <text start="1058.16" dur="5.13">system and you bring down the central</text>
  <text start="1061.4" dur="3.57">bank which then brings down the Federal</text>
  <text start="1063.29" dur="4.05">Reserve Note which brings down the</text>
  <text start="1064.97" dur="4.26">currency that we&amp;#39;re using today you need</text>
  <text start="1067.34" dur="5.79">to transition into something completely</text>
  <text start="1069.23" dur="6.09">different and this is going to hurt it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1073.13" dur="4.77">not going to be easy just like when the</text>
  <text start="1075.32" dur="4.71">Soviet Union fell and many other</text>
  <text start="1077.9" dur="5.37">countries when we went through different</text>
  <text start="1080.03" dur="6.36">types of resets and as we are the</text>
  <text start="1083.27" dur="5.04">reserve currency today we might not be</text>
  <text start="1086.39" dur="4.8">tomorrow so things are gonna change</text>
  <text start="1088.31" dur="4.98">dramatically and this is what the</text>
  <text start="1091.19" dur="6.27">country is being prepared for it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="1093.29" dur="6.63">prepared for this transition for a new</text>
  <text start="1097.46" dur="6.18">economic system and I do believe without</text>
  <text start="1099.92" dur="4.47">the central banking system so it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1103.64" dur="2.1">to be a bumpy ride</text>
  <text start="1104.39" dur="3.57">you&amp;#39;re still going to need to be</text>
