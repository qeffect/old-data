  <text start="206.66" dur="5.1">really doesn&amp;#39;t shine their country in a</text>
  <text start="209.63" dur="4.919">good light so they&amp;#39;re keeping it kind of</text>
  <text start="211.76" dur="5.94">a secret but a documentary from channel</text>
  <text start="214.549" dur="6.171">5 TV in Russia this documentary identify</text>

  <text start="254.03" dur="3.959">see right now they are reporting that</text>
  <text start="255.59" dur="5.13">this is the person who actually shot</text>
  <text start="257.989" dur="5.43">down MH 17 now nothing is confirmed</text>
  <text start="260.72" dur="5.46">right now this is being done on a or</text>
  <text start="263.419" dur="4.321">televised on a documentary and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="266.18" dur="3.15">going to have to look into this much</text>
  <text start="267.74" dur="3.78">much closer to see if this information</text>
  <text start="269.33" dur="3.91">really does pan out but it looks like</text>
  <text start="271.52" dur="3.489">they&amp;#39;re starting to come out with this</text>
  <text start="273.24" dur="6.23">information to show everyone that yes it</text>
  <text start="275.009" dur="7.711">was Ukraine who shot down this Boeing</text>
  <text start="279.47" dur="6.759">777 now we understand that Francis</text>
  <text start="282.72" dur="6.15">building the Mistral ships for Russia</text>
  <text start="286.229" dur="4.681">and they&amp;#39;re going back and forth if</text>
  <text start="288.87" dur="3.32">they&amp;#39;re going to supply these ships but</text>
  <text start="290.91" dur="3.75">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="292.19" dur="4.15">electronic equipment including hard</text>
  <text start="294.66" dur="3.689">drives and device operating the</text>
  <text start="296.34" dur="5.13">helicopter carries communication system</text>
  <text start="298.349" dur="5.311">has been stolen off the Mistral ships</text>
  <text start="301.47" dur="4.289">that are being built now was this done</text>
  <text start="303.66" dur="3.96">on purpose most likely because we</text>
  <text start="305.759" dur="4.021">understand the United States is putting</text>
  <text start="307.62" dur="4.32">pressure on France they wanted NATO to</text>
  <text start="309.78" dur="3.87">step in and purchase these ships but</text>
  <text start="311.94" dur="3.9">NATO just does not have the funds to do</text>
  <text start="313.65" dur="7.13">this and all the equipment that was</text>
  <text start="315.84" dur="7.02">taken from the ship&amp;#39;s only works on the</text>
  <text start="320.78" dur="3.609">carrier&amp;#39;s that they&amp;#39;re building it</text>
  <text start="322.86" dur="4.17">doesn&amp;#39;t really work anywhere else so</text>
  <text start="324.389" dur="5.971">this has to be some type of inside job</text>
  <text start="327.03" dur="5.16">or part of an operation so these ships</text>
  <text start="330.36" dur="4.29">cannot be delivered to Russia and of</text>
  <text start="332.19" dur="5.219">course as we know Russia will then say</text>
  <text start="334.65" dur="5.13">uh France broke the contract they owe us</text>
  <text start="337.409" dur="5.521">billions of dollars and we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="339.78" dur="5.129">see how this whole thing plays out now</text>
  <text start="342.93" dur="4.35">we understand Russia and China they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="344.909" dur="4.621">very close and they work together and it</text>
  <text start="347.28" dur="5.939">seems like that china is backing Russia</text>
  <text start="349.53" dur="5.939">with what&amp;#39;s going on in Ukraine what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="353.219" dur="5.641">going on in Crimea and what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="355.469" dur="6">all around the world and since China is</text>
  <text start="358.86" dur="6.809">supporting Russia it seems that Russia</text>
  <text start="361.469" dur="6.841">right now has supplied china with s400</text>
  <text start="365.669" dur="5.4">air defense systems to China and the</text>
  <text start="368.31" dur="7.71">contract was evaluated at about three</text>
  <text start="371.069" dur="6.991">billion dollars now it seems like in the</text>
  <text start="376.02" dur="4.11">Middle East the situation in Yemen is</text>
  <text start="378.06" dur="4.97">getting worse it seems like the people</text>
  <text start="380.13" dur="5.64">are really pushing to get a complete</text>
  <text start="383.03" dur="4.66">government government out of power it</text>
  <text start="385.77" dur="3.84">looks like the people have set off two</text>
  <text start="387.69" dur="4.8">bombs outside the US Embassy in Yemen</text>
  <text start="389.61" dur="6.179">and as we know people were evacuated in</text>
  <text start="392.49" dur="5.76">Yemen evacuated in Libya and pretty soon</text>
  <text start="395.789" dur="5.461">we&amp;#39;ll see an evacuation in Lebanon and</text>
  <text start="398.25" dur="4.68">Iraq as the situation deteriorates all</text>
  <text start="401.25" dur="3.479">throughout the Middle East and we can</text>
  <text start="402.93" dur="3.99">see right now that the United States</text>
  <text start="404.729" dur="4.231">France and other</text>
  <text start="406.92" dur="4.56">private western central bank countries</text>
  <text start="408.96" dur="4.17">they are preparing to go into these</text>
  <text start="411.48" dur="3.09">countries to restore the puppet</text>
  <text start="413.13" dur="3.03">government and they are making</text>
  <text start="414.57" dur="3.27">preparations as we know right now</text>
  <text start="416.16" dur="4.17">Francine United States have been setting</text>
  <text start="417.84" dur="4.32">up a base outside of Libya and there are</text>
  <text start="420.33" dur="5.61">rumors out there that the United States</text>
  <text start="422.16" dur="8.04">is trying to set up a base inside of</text>
  <text start="425.94" dur="7.2">Algeria but in Algerian foreign ministry</text>
  <text start="430.2" dur="5.22">official denied receiving a u.s. request</text>
  <text start="433.14" dur="3.9">to set up a military base or use the</text>
  <text start="435.42" dur="5.46">country&amp;#39;s airspace to carry out attacks</text>
  <text start="437.04" dur="6">in Libya Algeria has not received any</text>
  <text start="440.88" dur="3.81">request from the United States or from</text>
  <text start="443.04" dur="3.51">any other country concerning the issue</text>
  <text start="444.69" dur="4.77">the source who prefer to remain</text>
  <text start="446.55" dur="6.15">anonymous said Washington is well</text>
  <text start="449.46" dur="5.7">informed of the Algerian position that</text>
  <text start="452.7" dur="4.59">it is against any foreign military bases</text>
  <text start="455.16" dur="4.5">on its territory and opposes foreign</text>
  <text start="457.29" dur="4.35">countries using its airspace with the</text>
  <text start="459.66" dur="4.53">goal of conducting attacks on the</text>
  <text start="461.64" dur="4.41">militants position in a friendly state</text>
  <text start="464.19" dur="3.48">now why would they come out with</text>
  <text start="466.05" dur="3.96">something if the United States didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="467.67" dur="4.08">ask whatsoever why they denying it if</text>
  <text start="470.01" dur="3.02">they didn&amp;#39;t ask and it seems like the</text>
  <text start="471.75" dur="3.57">United States is trying to get a</text>
  <text start="473.03" dur="4.78">position where they can go into Libya</text>
  <text start="475.32" dur="4.23">once again and they&amp;#39;re using the Islamic</text>
  <text start="477.81" dur="3.57">state to make the case where they can go</text>
  <text start="479.55" dur="5.73">back into these countries because</text>
  <text start="481.38" dur="5.67">otherwise once they kick out the puppet</text>
  <text start="485.28" dur="4.26">regimes they take the country completely</text>
  <text start="487.05" dur="4.83">back and they start selling the oil not</text>
  <text start="489.54" dur="4.02">using the US dollar this is when the</text>
  <text start="491.88" dur="3.06">problem really starts because the other</text>
  <text start="493.56" dur="3.24">countries around the world are going to</text>
  <text start="494.94" dur="3.45">say listen I can buy this oil without</text>
  <text start="496.8" dur="3.6">using the US dollar we don&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="498.39" dur="4.14">keep the US dollar in reserves they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="500.4" dur="4.83">return it back to United States there&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="502.53" dur="5.28">be a flood of dollars inside the states</text>
  <text start="505.23" dur="4.65">it will devalue the dollar will see</text>
  <text start="507.81" dur="4.5">prices rise and the dollar will start</text>
  <text start="509.88" dur="3.81">collapse will start to collapse and this</text>
  <text start="512.31" dur="2.37">is what they&amp;#39;re trying to prevent and</text>
  <text start="513.69" dur="2.52">this is why they went into these</text>
  <text start="514.68" dur="3.45">countries in the first place to</text>
  <text start="516.21" dur="3.45">continually prop up the dollar and this</text>
  <text start="518.13" dur="3.24">is what they&amp;#39;re trying to do in Syria</text>
  <text start="519.66" dur="3.48">and then eventually in Iran they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="521.37" dur="4.41">trying to get in there set up a private</text>
  <text start="523.14" dur="5.31">western central bank then put all their</text>
  <text start="525.78" dur="4.56">resources on the dollar and pump out oil</text>
  <text start="528.45" dur="6.63">to all the other countries and they have</text>
  <text start="530.34" dur="7.29">to pay for this oil using the dollar now</text>
  <text start="535.08" dur="5.54">it seems like there are reports that now</text>
  <text start="537.63" dur="7.01">the Islamic state is firing upon</text>

  <text start="623.18" dur="4.59">today than they were when they first</text>
  <text start="624.92" dur="5.34">started because as we know they are not</text>
  <text start="627.77" dur="4.38">bombing the Islamic state what are they</text>
  <text start="630.26" dur="4.23">doing they&amp;#39;re going after the</text>
  <text start="632.15" dur="4.5">infrastructure inside Syria they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="634.49" dur="4.11">going after grain silos they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="636.65" dur="4.41">after oil refineries they&amp;#39;re going after</text>
  <text start="638.6" dur="4.17">oil fields they&amp;#39;re going after the</text>
  <text start="641.06" dur="3.75">buildings and infrastructure of these</text>
  <text start="642.77" dur="4.89">towns they&amp;#39;re going after the air bases</text>
  <text start="644.81" dur="5.13">to make sure that the Syrian forces</text>
  <text start="647.66" dur="5.31">cannot recapture these air bases and use</text>
  <text start="649.94" dur="6.15">them later on and this is why none of</text>
  <text start="652.97" dur="5.46">this is working right now now it looks</text>
  <text start="656.09" dur="6.63">like as we know the United States is</text>
  <text start="658.43" dur="6.24">building up forces to go into Syria and</text>
  <text start="662.72" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re using paid mercenaries to do</text>
  <text start="664.67" dur="4.65">this now the Pentagon plans to screen</text>
  <text start="666.92" dur="4.8">and train more mercenaries to fight</text>
  <text start="669.32" dur="4.68">against Syria the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="671.72" dur="5.1">determined at the training program</text>
  <text start="674" dur="5.52">the Syrians would not be subject to what</text>
  <text start="676.82" dur="4.8">are known as the Leahy laws which</text>
  <text start="679.52" dur="4.71">typically govern us security assistance</text>
  <text start="681.62" dur="4.47">to foreign forces under those laws a</text>
  <text start="684.23" dur="4.65">small office at the State Department</text>
  <text start="686.09" dur="4.95">works with US embassies overseas to</text>
  <text start="688.88" dur="4.83">ensure that recipients of the state or</text>
  <text start="691.04" dur="5.01">defense department security assistance</text>
  <text start="693.71" dur="4.32">aren&amp;#39;t linked to major human rights</text>
  <text start="696.05" dur="5.16">abuses now as we know we&amp;#39;ve been seeing</text>
  <text start="698.03" dur="6">videos and we also know that the Syrian</text>
  <text start="701.21" dur="6.41">rebels the paid mercenaries have been</text>
  <text start="704.03" dur="7.32">shelling civilians they&amp;#39;ve been using</text>
  <text start="707.62" dur="6.34">sarin gas against civilians and most of</text>
  <text start="711.35" dur="5.22">these rapide Burson Ares have committed</text>
  <text start="713.96" dur="6">offenses and human rights abuses and</text>
  <text start="716.57" dur="5.34">again basically what&amp;#39;s happening is the</text>
  <text start="719.96" dur="3.78">Obama administration is saying you know</text>
  <text start="721.91" dur="4.11">what they&amp;#39;re not subject to this law</text>
  <text start="723.74" dur="4.34">whatsoever because the Syrian rebels</text>
  <text start="726.02" dur="5.37">will not be part of a state-sponsored</text>
  <text start="728.08" dur="6.49">force the laws will not apply this is</text>
  <text start="731.39" dur="6.36">coming from the US officials so the US</text>
  <text start="734.57" dur="5.94">Congress has set aside 500 million to</text>
  <text start="737.75" dur="4.68">train equip and pay these fighters the</text>
  <text start="740.51" dur="3.48">US military will do nothing and the</text>
  <text start="742.43" dur="4.35">Obama administration claims that these</text>
  <text start="743.99" dur="5.34">are not state-sponsored forces all the</text>
  <text start="746.78" dur="4.68">groups the CIA has trained equipped to</text>
  <text start="749.33" dur="4.17">fight against Syria have committed major</text>
  <text start="751.46" dur="4.98">human rights violations but the Leahy</text>
  <text start="753.5" dur="4.74">law does not apply to the CIA now as the</text>
  <text start="756.44" dur="4.32">Pentagon takes over the training of such</text>
  <text start="758.24" dur="4.89">groups the Leahy law becomes relevant</text>
  <text start="760.76" dur="5.579">the Obama administration wants to avoid</text>
  <text start="763.13" dur="5.04">the applicability of the Leahy law</text>
  <text start="766.339" dur="3.75">because applying it would leave the</text>
  <text start="768.17" dur="4.2">Pentagon without any potential recruits</text>
  <text start="770.089" dur="4.171">to train as mercenaries against the</text>
  <text start="772.37" dur="4.11">Syrian government so basically they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="774.26" dur="3.99">saying you know what we&amp;#39;re just going to</text>
  <text start="776.48" dur="3.87">ignore this law and let&amp;#39;s just keep</text>
  <text start="778.25" dur="4.38">training and because our goal is to get</text>
  <text start="780.35" dur="3.75">Assad and we can see this with a lot of</text>
  <text start="782.63" dur="3.69">things that are going on right now that</text>
  <text start="784.1" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re just kind of ignoring all the</text>
  <text start="786.32" dur="6.03">laws even though they keep on telling us</text>
  <text start="788.27" dur="6.63">that we are a nation of law we need the</text>
  <text start="792.35" dur="5.88">rule of law but it seems like it the</text>
  <text start="794.9" dur="5.73">laws apply to these small people but not</text>
  <text start="798.23" dur="5.55">to government and this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="800.63" dur="5.61">starting to see and it is really really</text>
  <text start="803.78" dur="3.599">coming out all over the place as we go</text>
  <text start="806.24" dur="4.109">further I mean look</text>
  <text start="807.379" dur="4.89">how they treat the American people first</text>
  <text start="810.349" dur="3.69">they put them in little cages and fenced</text>
  <text start="812.269" dur="5.28">in areas where they tell them that they</text>
  <text start="814.039" dur="5.76">have to talk freely in these areas they</text>
  <text start="817.549" dur="5.22">have thousands of laws which they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="819.799" dur="6.59">trying to infringe upon the Second</text>
  <text start="822.769" dur="6.66">Amendment they created Common Core to</text>
  <text start="826.389" dur="5.74">brainwash our children and to convince</text>
  <text start="829.429" dur="5.01">them that the rights are not privileges</text>
  <text start="832.129" dur="3.93">so everything they&amp;#39;re doing is against</text>
  <text start="834.439" dur="4.32">the American people and they pick and</text>
  <text start="836.059" dur="4.77">choose which laws apply which laws don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="838.759" dur="4.74">apply and it seems like none of these</text>
  <text start="840.829" dur="4.74">apply to the government officials look</text>
  <text start="843.499" dur="4.83">at Obamacare for instance they decided</text>
  <text start="845.569" dur="4.62">to exempt themselves from Obamacare</text>
  <text start="848.329" dur="5.04">because they realize that this is not a</text>
  <text start="850.189" dur="5.76">health benefit whatsoever now we also</text>
  <text start="853.369" dur="4.2">see that the US and the allies are</text>
  <text start="855.949" dur="4.11">discussing the possibility of deploying</text>
  <text start="857.569" dur="5.25">ground forces from Arab nations to</text>
  <text start="860.059" dur="4.98">combat the Islamic state in Iraq so we</text>
  <text start="862.819" dur="3.84">can see right now and as we know they</text>
  <text start="865.039" dur="4.11">have been planning this for quite a</text>
  <text start="866.659" dur="5.01">while we know they&amp;#39;re bringing in ground</text>
  <text start="869.149" dur="4.05">forces into this area there&amp;#39;s a division</text>
  <text start="871.669" dur="3.12">headquarters being set up they can</text>
  <text start="873.199" dur="3.51">support between 10 and 30 thousand</text>
  <text start="874.789" dur="4.44">soldiers they&amp;#39;ve already established an</text>
  <text start="876.709" dur="4.95">airbase inside Iraq and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="879.229" dur="4.95">getting ready for the Arab troops to</text>
  <text start="881.659" dur="4.5">come in from all the Arab nations that</text>
  <text start="884.179" dur="3.78">are part of the coalition and before you</text>
  <text start="886.159" dur="5.67">know it you&amp;#39;re going to see US troops</text>
  <text start="887.959" dur="5.94">joining in with them and again this is</text>
  <text start="891.829" dur="5.43">all part of the plan they&amp;#39;re doing it</text>
  <text start="893.899" dur="5.19">very quietly very slowly so no one is</text>
  <text start="897.259" dur="3.961">the wiser and if you look at the mission</text>
  <text start="899.089" dur="5.011">creep inside of Iraq they started out</text>
  <text start="901.22" dur="5.069">with like 275 advisors and it went up to</text>
  <text start="904.1" dur="5.009">400 that it was we&amp;#39;re only sending in</text>
  <text start="906.289" dur="4.681">about 600 and now it&amp;#39;s 1,500 the next</text>
  <text start="909.109" dur="4.08">batch will probably be about 3,000</text>
  <text start="910.97" dur="6.419">advisors and as we know these advisors</text>
  <text start="913.189" dur="6.031">are military combat ready Marines ready</text>
  <text start="917.389" dur="3.93">to go and we see other nations are</text>
  <text start="919.22" dur="4.979">bringing in ground troops because the</text>
  <text start="921.319" dur="5.76">airstrikes will do nothing in this area</text>
  <text start="924.199" dur="5.61">against Assad and they know it this was</text>
  <text start="927.079" dur="5.28">just being used to pretty much hit all</text>
  <text start="929.809" dur="6.27">their infrastructure try to pretty much</text>
  <text start="932.359" dur="6.57">push the Islamic state their mercenary</text>
  <text start="936.079" dur="3.501">their proxy army towards Damascus and</text>
  <text start="938.929" dur="2.061">this</text>
  <text start="939.58" dur="3.57">exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing they cleared</text>
  <text start="940.99" dur="3.81">out the east side of Syria the northern</text>
  <text start="943.15" dur="3.75">section and now they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="944.8" dur="3.75">pushing towards the west and this is</text>
  <text start="946.9" dur="4.38">part of their plan but they cannot do</text>
  <text start="948.55" dur="4.32">this without ground troops listen</text>
  <text start="951.28" dur="3.93">everyone thanks a lot for listening be</text>
  <text start="952.87" dur="4.91">well be safe and especially be prepared</text>
  <text start="955.21" dur="2.57">thanks a lot</text>
