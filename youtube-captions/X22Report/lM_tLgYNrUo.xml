  <text start="59.059" dur="5.101">might be some more taxpayer bailouts</text>
  <text start="61.64" dur="5.7">because what we have to remember is that</text>
  <text start="64.16" dur="6.48">Spain has a lot of bad loans on these</text>
  <text start="67.34" dur="4.949">banks Spain is not doing well and we</text>

  <text start="72.289" dur="4.261">not doing well either and what we are</text>
  <text start="74.39" dur="4.679">seeing here is that they are trying to</text>

  <text start="85.3" dur="4.48">extremely high and this has been</text>
  <text start="87.89" dur="7.49">happening too many of the European</text>
  <text start="89.78" dur="7.77">nations Greece Cyprus France Portugal</text>
  <text start="95.38" dur="4.42">Spain which we&amp;#39;re talking about now</text>
  <text start="97.55" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re eating it we&amp;#39;re even seeing it</text>
  <text start="99.8" dur="4.799">flow into Germany and UK which is really</text>
  <text start="102.38" dur="4.379">not part of the eurozone is showing that</text>
  <text start="104.599" dur="3.871">there is a housing bubble that people</text>
  <text start="106.759" dur="4.261">who are living in the UK cannot make</text>
  <text start="108.47" dur="4.679">ends meet so they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re diving into</text>
  <text start="111.02" dur="3.87">their savings and we also have to</text>
  <text start="113.149" dur="5.84">remember in the United States the same</text>
  <text start="114.89" dur="7.77">thing is happening there is just a huge</text>
  <text start="118.989" dur="6.571">huge illusion of what the economy is</text>
  <text start="122.66" dur="5.7">compared to what the stock market is and</text>
  <text start="125.56" dur="5.38">the numbers have been manipulated they</text>
  <text start="128.36" dur="4.739">are now manipulating them in Europe they</text>
  <text start="130.94" dur="4.26">have been manipulating them in United</text>
  <text start="133.099" dur="5.491">States so what we are seeing right now</text>
  <text start="135.2" dur="5.6">is a complete illusion and really the</text>
  <text start="138.59" dur="5.42">Fed is the complete more</text>
  <text start="140.8" dur="6.42">get the fed controls the stock market it</text>
  <text start="144.01" dur="5.46">is not a free and open market the Fed</text>
  <text start="147.22" dur="5.67">also controls the unemployment numbers</text>
  <text start="149.47" dur="7.02">the Fed also controls GDP it also</text>
  <text start="152.89" dur="6.75">controls inflation it controls pretty</text>
  <text start="156.49" dur="6.65">much everything and they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="159.64" dur="7.35">everything seem like everything is going</text>
  <text start="163.14" dur="5.89">towards a recovery and this is what</text>
  <text start="166.99" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re trying to do and their main</text>
  <text start="169.03" dur="4.8">reason for this is because they</text>
  <text start="170.83" dur="5.43">understand that china is making their</text>
  <text start="173.83" dur="4.44">move and attacking the US dollar as the</text>
  <text start="176.26" dur="4.17">reserve currency in China is now making</text>
  <text start="178.27" dur="4.68">deals all over the place and they shot</text>
  <text start="180.43" dur="3.9">up some warning signs and everyone is</text>
  <text start="182.95" dur="3.21">seeing this in all other nations are</text>
  <text start="184.33" dur="4.86">starting to see this where they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="186.16" dur="4.44">that you want is that as as the petrol</text>
  <text start="189.19" dur="4.71">you want where they&amp;#39;re going to sell oil</text>
  <text start="190.6" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re no longer going to be holding US</text>
  <text start="193.9" dur="3.2">dollars or Treasury bonds they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="195.43" dur="3.75">actually going to be rejecting them</text>
  <text start="197.1" dur="4.15">because they don&amp;#39;t see the benefit</text>
  <text start="199.18" dur="5.85">Russia&amp;#39;s pretty much doing the same</text>
  <text start="201.25" dur="6.57">thing and that they are making a trade</text>
  <text start="205.03" dur="5.1">swap deals with other nations Africa has</text>
  <text start="207.82" dur="4.98">become a clearing house and they are</text>
  <text start="210.13" dur="5.55">pushing the u1 further and further</text>
  <text start="212.8" dur="4.74">making it an international currency and</text>
  <text start="215.68" dur="3.3">we can see what&amp;#39;s happening the central</text>
  <text start="217.54" dur="4.65">bankers are getting very nervous about</text>
  <text start="218.98" dur="5.009">this and the Fed was out there and you</text>
  <text start="222.19" dur="3.15">know since they&amp;#39;re the economy is</text>
  <text start="223.989" dur="3.961">recovering the unemployment is now</text>
  <text start="225.34" dur="4.53">fallen to seven percent and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="227.95" dur="4.14">seeing things pick up the stock market</text>
  <text start="229.87" dur="4.65">is reaching all-time new highs so all</text>
  <text start="232.09" dur="5.16">eyes on the stock market gold is being</text>
  <text start="234.52" dur="6.6">suppressed because if gold rose that</text>
  <text start="237.25" dur="7.26">would be a warning shot to every single</text>
  <text start="241.12" dur="5.7">person across the globe that something</text>
  <text start="244.51" dur="5.04">is wrong because if gold started to rise</text>
  <text start="246.82" dur="4.53">dramatically the US dollar would be</text>
  <text start="249.55" dur="3.42">dropping and people would be saying</text>
  <text start="251.35" dur="5.359">what&amp;#39;s going on here so they need to</text>
  <text start="252.97" dur="7.41">keep gold suppressed until the very last</text>
  <text start="256.709" dur="5.891">minute and the Fed was out there saying</text>
  <text start="260.38" dur="4.5">that because the economy is recovering</text>
  <text start="262.6" dur="4.17">and again let me just say this one more</text>
  <text start="264.88" dur="4.289">time Obama has Biden and other</text>
  <text start="266.77" dur="4.41">Democratic leaders going around the</text>
  <text start="269.169" dur="4.201">country just like Obama did during the</text>
  <text start="271.18" dur="3.33">summer letting everyone know that the</text>
  <text start="273.37" dur="2.79">economy is recover</text>
  <text start="274.51" dur="4.44">ring how well everything is housing is</text>
  <text start="276.16" dur="5.81">recovering and for my other reports</text>
  <text start="278.95" dur="5.7">we&amp;#39;ve talked about this in depth about</text>
  <text start="281.97" dur="4.81">mortgage applications plunging sales</text>
  <text start="284.65" dur="3.75">declining and again you&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="286.78" dur="4.47">see this in every single area at the</text>
  <text start="288.4" dur="4.38">same time it does take some time in</text>
  <text start="291.25" dur="4.8">different areas a little bit longer you</text>
  <text start="292.78" dur="4.95">see a lag I&amp;#39;ve told the story before I</text>
  <text start="296.05" dur="4.02">have a sister-in-law who lives in</text>
  <text start="297.73" dur="4.32">Florida I lived in New York and the real</text>
  <text start="300.07" dur="4.11">estate market you know was tanking back</text>
  <text start="302.05" dur="4.05">in two thousand eight couldn&amp;#39;t sell the</text>
  <text start="304.18" dur="4.71">house houses were on the market for nine</text>
  <text start="306.1" dur="4.71">months a year in Florida they didn&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="308.89" dur="3.45">anything everything was going perfectly</text>
  <text start="310.81" dur="4.68">they didn&amp;#39;t even know what I was talking</text>
  <text start="312.34" dur="5.22">about six to eight months later all of a</text>
  <text start="315.49" dur="5.31">sudden it hit Florida and Florida was</text>
  <text start="317.56" dur="5.7">hit worse than it was in New York and we</text>
  <text start="320.8" dur="5.28">can see what is happening right now the</text>
  <text start="323.26" dur="6">main players who pumped up the bubble</text>
  <text start="326.08" dur="5.25">are now dumping real estate and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="329.26" dur="6.18">trying to sell it to flippers actually</text>
  <text start="331.33" dur="6.57">on the radio I just heard a seminar that</text>
  <text start="335.44" dur="5.49">was being offered to people that this is</text>
  <text start="337.9" dur="5.04">the best time to flip homes and i</text>
  <text start="340.93" dur="3.96">believe it was someone from hgtv and</text>
  <text start="342.94" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re saying come to come to the</text>
  <text start="344.89" dur="4.2">seminar we&amp;#39;re looking for a small group</text>
  <text start="347.2" dur="5.19">of people because we&amp;#39;re going to flip</text>
  <text start="349.09" dur="5.43">homes make money retain your wealth and</text>
  <text start="352.39" dur="7.35">this is the best time to do it and we</text>
  <text start="354.52" dur="7.83">saw this happen during 2007 to into 2008</text>
  <text start="359.74" dur="6.03">and we know what happened at that time</text>
  <text start="362.35" dur="6.18">but back to the Fed they are saying that</text>
  <text start="365.77" dur="5.07">they would like to start tapering before</text>
  <text start="368.53" dur="4.05">march others are saying they would also</text>
  <text start="370.84" dur="4.23">like to see it even sooner than that</text>
  <text start="372.58" dur="4.62">maybe january and i believe fed evans</text>
  <text start="375.07" dur="5.01">has said it would be great if they could</text>
  <text start="377.2" dur="4.14">get it done in december now i personally</text>
  <text start="380.08" dur="3.36">think they&amp;#39;re probably going to end up</text>
  <text start="381.34" dur="4.77">telling us they&amp;#39;re going to be doing it</text>
  <text start="383.44" dur="4.23">between january and februari during that</text>
  <text start="386.11" dur="3.63">time frame because i believe this is</text>
  <text start="387.67" dur="5.79">when the event will occur where</text>
  <text start="389.74" dur="6.87">something will hit the US and the entire</text>
  <text start="393.46" dur="4.98">system the entire economy will start to</text>
  <text start="396.61" dur="4.47">crumble and they will have the ability</text>
  <text start="398.44" dur="3.93">to blame it on another nation so this</text>
  <text start="401.08" dur="4.02">way they don&amp;#39;t take the blame and</text>
  <text start="402.37" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;ll be able to increase QE like they</text>
  <text start="405.1" dur="3.3">want to because they need to increase QE</text>
  <text start="407.59" dur="3.45">because</text>
  <text start="408.4" dur="4.41">when the nation&amp;#39;s realize that the</text>
  <text start="411.04" dur="3.84">central bankers US government or losing</text>
  <text start="412.81" dur="5.04">control over the call over the world and</text>
  <text start="414.88" dur="4.98">the US dollar the usage of the u.s.</text>
  <text start="417.85" dur="4.74">dollar is shrinking and the yuan is</text>
  <text start="419.86" dur="4.89">growing a lot of countries are going to</text>
  <text start="422.59" dur="4.47">stop using the US dollar they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="424.75" dur="4.05">to sell their Treasury bonds and the Fed</text>
  <text start="427.06" dur="4.35">at this point is going to have to really</text>
  <text start="428.8" dur="6">step up the purchasing of the Treasury</text>
  <text start="431.41" dur="5.94">bonds and as the US dollar plummets real</text>
  <text start="434.8" dur="4.17">estate stock market everything&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="437.35" dur="3.629">to start to fall and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="438.97" dur="4.229">really have to start step stepping up</text>
  <text start="440.979" dur="4.291">their game and this is why they let it</text>
  <text start="443.199" dur="3.661">leak out saying that they would like to</text>
  <text start="445.27" dur="3.899">increase it by fifty percent which I</text>
  <text start="446.86" dur="4.2">believe it&amp;#39;s going to be a lot more and</text>
  <text start="449.169" dur="5.521">Jim Willie actually came out with an</text>
  <text start="451.06" dur="6.87">article saying that the Fed will be</text>
  <text start="454.69" dur="4.89">increasing QE because if you really look</text>
  <text start="457.93" dur="5.4">around the world and you see what is</text>
  <text start="459.58" dur="7.8">happening they have no other choice at</text>
  <text start="463.33" dur="6.42">this time so what we can really say is</text>
  <text start="467.38" dur="4.86">there&amp;#39;s not going to be a taper there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="469.75" dur="4.83">going to be an illusion of a taper and</text>
  <text start="472.24" dur="6.299">then there&amp;#39;s going to be an event and</text>
  <text start="474.58" dur="6.269">this is how it&amp;#39;s all being planned out</text>
  <text start="478.539" dur="5.581">this is how all the pieces are being fit</text>
  <text start="480.849" dur="5.841">into this next false flag event so they</text>
  <text start="484.12" dur="7.799">can blame everything on another country</text>
  <text start="486.69" dur="9.46">now Obamacare again is a cash grab it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="491.919" dur="6.81">to raise revenue to pay off and to keep</text>
  <text start="496.15" dur="4.71">the debt of the government sustained</text>
  <text start="498.729" dur="4.891">right now because at this point they are</text>
  <text start="500.86" dur="5.489">not bringing in enough tax revenue to</text>
  <text start="503.62" dur="4.68">sustain 17 trillion dollars which many</text>
  <text start="506.349" dur="4.261">people are saying is really around 200</text>
  <text start="508.3" dur="6.179">trillion but let&amp;#39;s just use 17 trillion</text>
  <text start="510.61" dur="6.33">because the debt is escalating at a pace</text>
  <text start="514.479" dur="4.62">that is unprecedented and it cannot be</text>
  <text start="516.94" dur="4.019">sustained just like Greece just like</text>
  <text start="519.099" dur="3.781">France the only differences the United</text>
  <text start="520.959" dur="4.111">States is able to print money the other</text>
  <text start="522.88" dur="4.95">countries have to borrow the money and</text>
  <text start="525.07" dur="4.2">as they keep printing there&amp;#39;s more and</text>
  <text start="527.83" dur="3.03">more debt and if you really think about</text>
  <text start="529.27" dur="3.87">it it&amp;#39;s like someone having a credit</text>
  <text start="530.86" dur="5.31">card with this with a fixed amount of</text>
  <text start="533.14" dur="4.77">income it could not happen and usually</text>
  <text start="536.17" dur="4.83">what happens to these households as they</text>
  <text start="537.91" dur="4.02">go into bankruptcy and this is what</text>
  <text start="541" dur="3.6">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="541.93" dur="5.43">so the government is out there imposing</text>
  <text start="544.6" dur="5.16">new tax laws imposing laws like fact</text>
  <text start="547.36" dur="6.18">that where they can go across to other</text>
  <text start="549.76" dur="5.79">nations and look for tax revenue they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="553.54" dur="4.109">made a deal with the Swiss where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="555.55" dur="4.77">going to turn in the people there so</text>
  <text start="557.649" dur="4.591">they can go and raid their bank accounts</text>
  <text start="560.32" dur="4.44">and collect the tax revenue that they</text>
  <text start="562.24" dur="5.25">need and this is what is happening at</text>
  <text start="564.76" dur="4.829">this time and Obamacare is actually</text>
  <text start="567.49" dur="4.68">making it worse and right now seventy</text>
  <text start="569.589" dur="4.921">percent of California doctors expected</text>
  <text start="572.17" dur="4.71">to boycott Obamacare what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="574.51" dur="5.1">is is that you know seven out of ten</text>
  <text start="576.88" dur="4.89">physicians in California are rebelling</text>
  <text start="579.61" dur="4.49">against the state&amp;#39;s obamacare health</text>
  <text start="581.77" dur="5.46">insurance exchange and won&amp;#39;t participate</text>
  <text start="584.1" dur="5.29">because they say it doesn&amp;#39;t benefit them</text>
  <text start="587.23" dur="4.859">they don&amp;#39;t make any money from it and</text>
  <text start="589.39" dur="4.86">they don&amp;#39;t pay enough and you know we</text>
  <text start="592.089" dur="5.881">can see what is happening Obamacare</text>
  <text start="594.25" dur="5.67">pretty much what happened there is he</text>
  <text start="597.97" dur="4.619">wanted the central bankers needed</text>
  <text start="599.92" dur="4.53">revenue the insurance companies wanted</text>
  <text start="602.589" dur="3.451">to make more money because you have to</text>
  <text start="604.45" dur="5.37">remember insurance companies make money</text>
  <text start="606.04" dur="6.39">when they take all the money that is</text>
  <text start="609.82" dur="5.25">collected for insurance and they have</text>
  <text start="612.43" dur="4.59">interest upon that money right now</text>
  <text start="615.07" dur="3.99">interest rates are at zero pretty much</text>
  <text start="617.02" dur="3.54">zero percent so they&amp;#39;re not making any</text>
  <text start="619.06" dur="2.58">money so what do they have to do and I</text>
  <text start="620.56" dur="3.24">don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve seen this but I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="621.64" dur="4.56">seen it in my auto insurance they raise</text>
  <text start="623.8" dur="4.71">premiums they raise it on medical they</text>
  <text start="626.2" dur="5.009">raise it on auto and you see your</text>
  <text start="628.51" dur="4.829">premiums going higher and higher and if</text>
  <text start="631.209" dur="6.391">you really look at auto insurance just I</text>
  <text start="633.339" dur="7.531">just want to just you know going off the</text>
  <text start="637.6" dur="5.31">subject just a little bit if you look at</text>
  <text start="640.87" dur="3.9">auto insurance they added on that</text>
  <text start="642.91" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re doing credit checks on auto</text>
  <text start="644.77" dur="4.53">insurance to make sure that you have</text>
  <text start="648.04" dur="3.539">good credit and if you have good credit</text>
  <text start="649.3" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;ll give you a lower rate and if you</text>
  <text start="651.579" dur="5.401">are bad credit they&amp;#39;ll give you a higher</text>
  <text start="653.5" dur="5.88">rate what this has to do with auto</text>
  <text start="656.98" dur="4.169">insurance it&amp;#39;s pretty much nothing it</text>
  <text start="659.38" dur="4.769">has nothing to do with a driving record</text>
  <text start="661.149" dur="5.971">it has nothing to do about pretty much</text>
  <text start="664.149" dur="6.481">anything except getting those people who</text>
  <text start="667.12" dur="5.49">have bad credit higher premiums that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="670.63" dur="4.74">all I&amp;#39;ve had it just like they need to</text>
  <text start="672.61" dur="5.4">get more cash so if you look at</text>
  <text start="675.37" dur="4.29">the health care industry the insurance</text>
  <text start="678.01" dur="3.96">companies and Obama they got together</text>
  <text start="679.66" dur="4.23">and say listen we want to get health</text>
  <text start="681.97" dur="4.41">insurance to every single person in</text>
  <text start="683.89" dur="4.17">America how can we go about doing this</text>
  <text start="686.38" dur="3.18">and the health insurance companies and</text>
  <text start="688.06" dur="4.35">they have actuaries in there that</text>
  <text start="689.56" dur="5.31">calculate you know how much money they</text>
  <text start="692.41" dur="4.44">need and who has diseases and how much</text>
  <text start="694.87" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re going to pay out and their</text>
  <text start="696.85" dur="5.16">formula came up with listen we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="699.61" dur="4.919">to have to raise premiums we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="702.01" dur="4.89">have to raise deductibles and the only</text>
  <text start="704.529" dur="5.221">way this will work is we need everyone</text>
  <text start="706.9" dur="4.29">in on the system so of course the</text>
  <text start="709.75" dur="4.23">government says how are we going to make</text>
  <text start="711.19" dur="4.56">everyone in there I have an idea if you</text>
  <text start="713.98" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t take it would kina lies them and</text>
  <text start="715.75" dur="5.01">at least we&amp;#39;re making money on the back</text>
  <text start="718.45" dur="4.2">end if they don&amp;#39;t take it and this is</text>
  <text start="720.76" dur="6.39">how this goes this is how this comes</text>
  <text start="722.65" dur="7.17">about this is the only way insurance</text>
  <text start="727.15" dur="5.58">works you need the majority at least</text>
  <text start="729.82" dur="5.7">ninety-five percent of the people in on</text>
  <text start="732.73" dur="4.799">the system because if you don&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="735.52" dur="4.189">system can&amp;#39;t work because you need a</text>
  <text start="737.529" dur="4.231">certain amount of healthy people</text>
  <text start="739.709" dur="6.25">supporting the people that are sick so</text>
  <text start="741.76" dur="5.61">they need to up the premiums up the</text>
  <text start="745.959" dur="3.481">deductibles and when they up the</text>
  <text start="747.37" dur="4.35">deductibles that means the insurance</text>
  <text start="749.44" dur="3.6">agencies aren&amp;#39;t paying out so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="751.72" dur="3.66">not losing any money but they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="753.04" dur="4.53">collecting their premiums and this is</text>
  <text start="755.38" dur="4.59">how this works out and this is a</text>
  <text start="757.57" dur="4.26">complete cash grabs because the</text>
  <text start="759.97" dur="3.989">government gets a piece of the action</text>
  <text start="761.83" dur="3.449">they get the piece of the action when</text>
  <text start="763.959" dur="4.07">you pay for the insurance and they get a</text>
  <text start="765.279" dur="5.401">piece of the action when you don&amp;#39;t from</text>
  <text start="768.029" dur="4.06">penalties and taxes and they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="770.68" dur="4.02">the same thing for companies and</text>
  <text start="772.089" dur="4.831">actually this Obamacare is actually</text>
  <text start="774.7" dur="4.44">hurting the economy because most of the</text>
  <text start="776.92" dur="4.14">companies now are reducing the number of</text>
  <text start="779.14" dur="5.19">hours reducing the number of employees</text>
  <text start="781.06" dur="5.58">and they&amp;#39;re trying to sidestep the</text>
  <text start="784.33" dur="3.6">penalties and not give out health</text>
  <text start="786.64" dur="3.42">insurance and some of the larger</text>
  <text start="787.93" dur="4.47">companies like Home Depot decided that</text>
  <text start="790.06" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;ll only pay for one spouse and the</text>
  <text start="792.4" dur="5.309">other spouse can go off and go on to the</text>
  <text start="795.91" dur="4.83">Obamacare exchanges so this way it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="797.709" dur="5.101">a cost to the business and this is how</text>
  <text start="800.74" dur="3.54">this is all planning out and the doctors</text>
  <text start="802.81" dur="3.48">are not seeing the benefits actually</text>
  <text start="804.28" dur="3.75">many of the doctors are against</text>
  <text start="806.29" dur="3.48">Obamacare because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="808.03" dur="4.05">saying that the amount that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="809.77" dur="4.62">getting paid and what is happening at</text>
  <text start="812.08" dur="5.01">this time is a total control of the</text>
  <text start="814.39" dur="6.93">medical industry and that would be by</text>
  <text start="817.09" dur="6.18">the insurance companies now the other</text>

  <text start="918.61" dur="5.01">right now is we see all this spine we</text>
  <text start="921.76" dur="4.23">see what NSA is doing we see they want</text>
  <text start="923.62" dur="6.12">to put these type of drone Roberts on</text>
  <text start="925.99" dur="7.08">every street in America to watch over</text>
  <text start="929.74" dur="4.77">everyone and the FBI pretty much just</text>
  <text start="933.07" dur="4.74">admitted that they&amp;#39;re able to turn on</text>

  <text start="951.85" dur="5.82">idea if someone is actually recording</text>
  <text start="955.84" dur="4.56">and listening to what you&amp;#39;re doing and</text>
  <text start="957.67" dur="5.04">this goes on to say the Washington Post</text>
  <text start="960.4" dur="4.59">reports at the FBI has the ability to</text>

  <text start="969.46" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;ve been doing this for years but</text>
  <text start="973.36" dur="5.91">don&amp;#39;t worry they say they&amp;#39;re only doing</text>
  <text start="975.55" dur="7.14">this to catch terrorists and very</text>

  <text start="982.69" dur="5.31">people believe that I certainly don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="984.67" dur="7.859">and what we are seeing now in regards to</text>
  <text start="988" dur="8.4">DHS is that a the key plank of the Obama</text>
  <text start="992.529" dur="7.231">administration platform was to have the</text>
  <text start="996.4" dur="5.25">conversion of the local police into the</text>
  <text start="999.76" dur="5.01">fifth branch of the US Armed Forces</text>
  <text start="1001.65" dur="5.01">called DHS and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1004.77" dur="4.65">doing right now they are giving grants</text>
  <text start="1006.66" dur="6.51">to every single law enforcement merging</text>
  <text start="1009.42" dur="5.669">them into DHS and before you know it you</text>
  <text start="1013.17" dur="6.06">will not be able to distinguish your</text>
  <text start="1015.089" dur="5.641">local law enforcement from DHS and right</text>
  <text start="1019.23" dur="4.29">now cash-strapped local law enforcement</text>
  <text start="1020.73" dur="5.01">gobbles up federal grants which they are</text>
  <text start="1023.52" dur="3.9">doing right now and they&amp;#39;re purchasing</text>
  <text start="1025.74" dur="3.03">of course the military grade vehicles</text>
  <text start="1027.42" dur="3.6">weapons ammunition and surveillance</text>
  <text start="1028.77" dur="5.73">technology that would make the nation&amp;#39;</text>
  <text start="1031.02" dur="6.51">National Security Agency proud the NSA</text>
  <text start="1034.5" dur="4.949">very proud of this and they are doing</text>
  <text start="1037.53" dur="4.35">this and this is an interview with the</text>
  <text start="1039.449" dur="4.5">new American Fitzgerald said there is</text>
  <text start="1041.88" dur="3.78">virtually no use for the military grade</text>
  <text start="1043.949" dur="4.38">equipment being bought by local</text>
  <text start="1045.66" dur="5.49">enforcement with DHS grant money the</text>
  <text start="1048.329" dur="5.551">only reason to have this equipment is to</text>
  <text start="1051.15" dur="5.58">use it Fitzgerald said and it is likely</text>
  <text start="1053.88" dur="5.549">it would be used against local citizens</text>
  <text start="1056.73" dur="9.06">who have risen up and created some sort</text>
  <text start="1059.429" dur="10.051">of civil disorder DHS Fitzgerald says</text>
  <text start="1065.79" dur="7.38">that may be and anticipating these riots</text>
  <text start="1069.48" dur="5.94">and looks to them as a justification for</text>
  <text start="1073.17" dur="4.98">the militarization</text>
  <text start="1075.42" dur="5.16">of the police and if you really look</text>
  <text start="1078.15" dur="4.65">around you see every single police force</text>
  <text start="1080.58" dur="4.62">out there buying the tanks looking more</text>
  <text start="1082.8" dur="6.21">military and they&amp;#39;re in the process</text>
  <text start="1085.2" dur="7.5">right now of merging the two so you will</text>
  <text start="1089.01" dur="7.05">not even know who is who anymore pretty</text>
  <text start="1092.7" dur="6.03">soon they will all be called DHS they</text>
  <text start="1096.06" dur="5.52">will be controlled by the federal</text>
  <text start="1098.73" dur="5.64">government and it will be a federal</text>
  <text start="1101.58" dur="6.42">agency and you&amp;#39;ll have no more local law</text>
  <text start="1104.37" dur="6.6">enforcement and this is the end game to</text>
  <text start="1108" dur="4.68">go around confiscate the weapons get</text>
  <text start="1110.97" dur="3.81">those people who they deem as a threat</text>
  <text start="1112.68" dur="4.56">because they do have lists and these</text>
  <text start="1114.78" dur="4.26">lists have been popping up their secret</text>
  <text start="1117.24" dur="3.75">list and you don&amp;#39;t know how you get on</text>

  <text start="1268.679" dur="5.701">to get us into Syria to get us into Iran</text>
  <text start="1271.8" dur="5.31">and eventually have World War 3 with</text>
  <text start="1274.38" dur="5.16">China because that is the main threat</text>
  <text start="1277.11" dur="6.319">right now because it is a threat to the</text>
  <text start="1279.54" dur="6.69">US dollar as the reserve currency and</text>
  <text start="1283.429" dur="4.811">again these central bankers are not</text>
  <text start="1286.23" dur="6.18">going to let this happen they&amp;#39;d rather</text>
  <text start="1288.24" dur="7.2">have a war started supply you know</text>
  <text start="1292.41" dur="6.54">whatever sides or whatever country with</text>
  <text start="1295.44" dur="6.69">weapons by loaning their money with</text>
  <text start="1298.95" dur="5.34">interest and at the end of the day they</text>
  <text start="1302.13" dur="4.59">would like to reset the entire system</text>
  <text start="1304.29" dur="5.25">just like they did after World War Two</text>
  <text start="1306.72" dur="4.44">and start the whole fiat currency and</text>
  <text start="1309.54" dur="4.62">loaning the government&amp;#39;s whatever</text>
  <text start="1311.16" dur="5.34">government comes out alive you know and</text>
  <text start="1314.16" dur="4.41">ready to deal this is what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1316.5" dur="3.75">to try to do and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1318.57" dur="5.31">trying named they&amp;#39;re hoping that it will</text>
  <text start="1320.25" dur="5.97">be the u.s. now we understand that there</text>
  <text start="1323.88" dur="5.85">was a cyberattack in the UK it hit the</text>
  <text start="1326.22" dur="5.16">RBS natwest bank and people couldn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="1329.73" dur="2.96">their money it was very difficult for</text>
  <text start="1331.38" dur="7.08">him to do and there was another glitch</text>
  <text start="1332.69" dur="8.29">in the UK which had it was in the air</text>
  <text start="1338.46" dur="3.69">traffic control it was a glitch in the</text>
  <text start="1340.98" dur="3.6">system in hundred</text>
  <text start="1342.15" dur="4.56">UK flights were grounded and they they</text>
  <text start="1344.58" dur="4.62">couldn&amp;#39;t take off and thousands of</text>
  <text start="1346.71" dur="4.86">passengers have been stranded at major</text>
  <text start="1349.2" dur="4.23">airports across the United Kingdom after</text>
  <text start="1351.57" dur="4.89">a technical problem at the country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1353.43" dur="4.56">main air traffic control center and what</text>
  <text start="1356.46" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re saying is that there were some</text>
  <text start="1357.99" dur="4.83">technical problem and they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1360.3" dur="4.8">switch from night mode two day mode and</text>
  <text start="1362.82" dur="4.68">we will have to see if they come out</text>
  <text start="1365.1" dur="5.28">later letting us know that there was</text>
  <text start="1367.5" dur="4.92">some type of cyber attack on the system</text>
  <text start="1370.38" dur="4.41">just like they let us know days later</text>
  <text start="1372.42" dur="4.86">with the natwest that that&amp;#39;s what that</text>
  <text start="1374.79" dur="5.88">was the real reason of the problem and</text>
  <text start="1377.28" dur="7.01">we have to understand that all of these</text>
  <text start="1380.67" dur="6.6">glitches that we see in Nasdaq the stock</text>
  <text start="1384.29" dur="6.4">exchange there was a cyber attack in the</text>
  <text start="1387.27" dur="6.54">Chicago Mercantile this is all being set</text>
  <text start="1390.69" dur="5.94">up there is a malware called never quest</text>
  <text start="1393.81" dur="4.8">that can lay dormant on a bank system it</text>
  <text start="1396.63" dur="4.41">could also steal your username and</text>
  <text start="1398.61" dur="6.09">password and it has the ability to</text>
  <text start="1401.04" dur="7.17">destroy or siphon off money at a flick</text>
  <text start="1404.7" dur="5.55">of a switch and who knows they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1408.21" dur="3.18">know the extent of any of these systems</text>
  <text start="1410.25" dur="3.99">they don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1411.39" dur="6.93">compromised they don&amp;#39;t know if there is</text>
  <text start="1414.24" dur="6.09">malware sitting on the system&amp;#39;s so this</text>
  <text start="1418.32" dur="4.71">to me seems like they are completely</text>
  <text start="1420.33" dur="5.7">setting up all of this for some type of</text>
  <text start="1423.03" dur="5.7">cyber attack on the banks on the</text>
  <text start="1426.03" dur="4.29">financial institutions and this is why</text>
  <text start="1428.73" dur="3.48">all of these documents and these</text>
  <text start="1430.32" dur="3.63">documents are real the FDIC Bank of</text>
  <text start="1432.21" dur="3.78">England if you don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1433.95" dur="4.95">talking about go up to resources on the</text>
  <text start="1435.99" dur="5.04">x 22 report com site you&amp;#39;ll see a tab</text>
  <text start="1438.9" dur="5.13">that says documents it&amp;#39;s called the FDIC</text>
  <text start="1441.03" dur="6.45">Bank of England document and nations</text>
  <text start="1444.03" dur="5.67">across the eurozone Canada Switzerland</text>
  <text start="1447.48" dur="5.24">Australia they have been all</text>
  <text start="1449.7" dur="5.37">implementing balance and there&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="1452.72" dur="5.89">confirmation from the European leaders</text>
  <text start="1455.07" dur="6.66">that they will be doing balance if banks</text>
  <text start="1458.61" dur="6.21">collapsed the Fed has also been telling</text>
  <text start="1461.73" dur="6.33">the banks to create their living wills</text>
  <text start="1464.82" dur="5.43">so when the collapse does occur they can</text>
  <text start="1468.06" dur="4.17">have everything laid out and how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1470.25" dur="4.5">going to go about doing the balance</text>
  <text start="1472.23" dur="3.27">because the dodd-frank act says there</text>
  <text start="1474.75" dur="3.57">are no</text>
  <text start="1475.5" dur="7.61">more government bailout so the only way</text>
  <text start="1478.32" dur="9.06">they could they can basically bell these</text>
  <text start="1483.11" dur="6.13">collapsing banks out is to go inward and</text>
  <text start="1487.38" dur="4.05">look at the depositors and take their</text>
  <text start="1489.24" dur="4.56">money and this why Cyprus this is why</text>
  <text start="1491.43" dur="5.31">Cyprus was so important because this was</text>
  <text start="1493.8" dur="5.04">the template of the FDIC Bank of England</text>
  <text start="1496.74" dur="6.66">document that document was created in</text>
  <text start="1498.84" dur="6.93">December of 2012 the bail ins in Cyprus</text>
  <text start="1503.4" dur="5.01">were done I think in February late</text>
  <text start="1505.77" dur="4.56">februari March and we have to remember</text>
  <text start="1508.41" dur="2.97">back in that time they said oh they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1510.33" dur="2.37">only going to take about eight percent</text>
  <text start="1511.38" dur="3.36">of the people&amp;#39;s money they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1512.7" dur="4.89">freeze capital controls will only be two</text>
  <text start="1514.74" dur="4.14">weeks it is going to be almost a year</text>
  <text start="1517.59" dur="3.39">and we have to see if they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1518.88" dur="4.35">be you know remove the capital controls</text>
  <text start="1520.98" dur="5.01">at that time they said maybe sometime in</text>
  <text start="1523.23" dur="5.25">January February of 2014 and they also</text>
  <text start="1525.99" dur="4.56">ended up taking forty seven percent of</text>
  <text start="1528.48" dur="5.94">the people&amp;#39;s money and then replaced it</text>
  <text start="1530.55" dur="7.65">with worthless bank stock so we can see</text>
  <text start="1534.42" dur="7.38">how that played out and we can see that</text>
  <text start="1538.2" dur="5.55">the government and the banks are looking</text>
  <text start="1541.8" dur="4.41">at this saying you know what this worked</text>
  <text start="1543.75" dur="4.74">out well it was nice and easy there were</text>
  <text start="1546.21" dur="4.65">no riots people don&amp;#39;t really say</text>
  <text start="1548.49" dur="4.71">anything and we&amp;#39;re able to take their</text>
  <text start="1550.86" dur="5.28">money again if you have any money in the</text>
  <text start="1553.2" dur="4.62">bank a my personal opinion i&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1556.14" dur="4.05">saying to do it or not do it but in my</text>
  <text start="1557.82" dur="5.94">personal opinion I keep some homes</text>
  <text start="1560.19" dur="4.89">hidden someplace just in case something</text>
  <text start="1563.76" dur="3.51">happens because you don&amp;#39;t want to wake</text>
  <text start="1565.08" dur="3.99">up like the people in Cyprus the next</text>
  <text start="1567.27" dur="3.9">morning and say wait a minute i can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1569.07" dur="3.78">take out money oh crap i should have</text>
  <text start="1571.17" dur="3.51">taken money out and put it someplace i</text>
  <text start="1572.85" dur="3.24">would also invest in gold and silver</text>
  <text start="1574.68" dur="4.8">because when you&amp;#39;re in gold and silver</text>
  <text start="1576.09" dur="6.45">it is an insurance policy on the fiat</text>
  <text start="1579.48" dur="5.88">currency it is also a way to stay off</text>
  <text start="1582.54" dur="6.96">the grid because this is the gold and</text>
  <text start="1585.36" dur="7.8">silver is not you know in in in the</text>
  <text start="1589.5" dur="7.89">government system it&amp;#39;s off the grid it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1593.16" dur="7.05">out of the system and again as the paper</text>
  <text start="1597.39" dur="5.7">money collapses at least you have silver</text>
  <text start="1600.21" dur="6.87">and gold and the new currency and what</text>
  <text start="1603.09" dur="5.4">is happening will be priced to the gold</text>
  <text start="1607.08" dur="1.95">and silver will be priced to whatever</text>
  <text start="1608.49" dur="3.45">paper</text>
  <text start="1609.03" dur="6.6">comes about and this is why it is a good</text>
  <text start="1611.94" dur="5.73">idea listen everyone thanks a lot thanks</text>
  <text start="1615.63" dur="5.54">a lot for listening be well be safe and</text>
