  <text start="64.84" dur="4.75">country&amp;#39;s pivot away from the dollar as</text>
  <text start="67.34" dur="5.1">the central bankers prepare for the</text>
  <text start="69.59" dur="5.01">collapse let&amp;#39;s get into the economic</text>
  <text start="72.44" dur="5.07">collapse financial news now we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="74.6" dur="5.48">watching a couple things in regards to</text>
  <text start="77.51" dur="5.25">the global economy we&amp;#39;ve been watching</text>
  <text start="80.08" dur="5.44">the people&amp;#39;s economy the real economy</text>
  <text start="82.76" dur="6.09">where there&amp;#39;s stores where there&amp;#39;s jobs</text>
  <text start="85.52" dur="6.36">where there&amp;#39;s manufacturing those type</text>
  <text start="88.85" dur="5.7">of things well plus real estate and</text>
  <text start="91.88" dur="5.46">things like that that is declining very</text>
  <text start="94.55" dur="5.19">very rapidly we also been looking at the</text>
  <text start="97.34" dur="4.35">illusion where the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="99.74" dur="4.409">continually keeping this illusion alive</text>
  <text start="101.69" dur="4.709">making us seem like everything is great</text>
  <text start="104.149" dur="4.741">and this is done with stock market</text>
  <text start="106.399" dur="4.681">numbers by manipulating the unemployment</text>
  <text start="108.89" dur="4.8">numbers and things like that real estate</text>
  <text start="111.08" dur="4.41">numbers blowing up bubbles this is what</text>
  <text start="113.69" dur="5.63">they do and this is what they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="115.49" dur="8.43">all along and two important things</text>
  <text start="119.32" dur="8.08">happen today where it gives us a clear</text>
  <text start="123.92" dur="6.809">signal that the central banks are</text>
  <text start="127.4" dur="4.77">preparing to bring this economy down it</text>
  <text start="130.729" dur="3.801">looks like they might have their</text>
  <text start="132.17" dur="6.48">scapegoat and might be more than one</text>
  <text start="134.53" dur="6.519">individual or group or countries that</text>
  <text start="138.65" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re going to blame this on we also</text>
  <text start="141.049" dur="6.961">have the banks around the world where</text>
  <text start="144.59" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re going to now accept into the</text>
  <text start="148.01" dur="5.67">reserves the petrol you want and these</text>
  <text start="151.1" dur="3.9">are two very very important things that</text>
  <text start="153.68" dur="3.54">are happening right in front of our face</text>
  <text start="155" dur="4.35">and if I go back in time I remember the</text>
  <text start="157.22" dur="4.95">time where you know if you go back to</text>
  <text start="159.35" dur="5.88">three years where we were talking about</text>
  <text start="162.17" dur="5.43">the Chinese you won the remember being</text>
  <text start="165.23" dur="5.61">included in the SDR basket becoming a</text>
  <text start="167.6" dur="5.22">reserve currency and at that time people</text>
  <text start="170.84" dur="2.79">were like no this this won&amp;#39;t happen this</text>
  <text start="172.82" dur="3.06">is impossible</text>
  <text start="173.63" dur="4.32">and everyone saying well now we have the</text>
  <text start="175.88" dur="3.87">petrol yuan but guess what it&amp;#39;s tiny</text>
  <text start="177.95" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s small it can never become the</text>
  <text start="179.75" dur="5.39">reserve currency well let me ask you how</text>
  <text start="182.66" dur="5.51">quickly did the dollar become</text>
  <text start="185.14" dur="5.97">the petrodollar once we came off the</text>
  <text start="188.17" dur="6.36">gold standard does it really take that</text>
  <text start="191.11" dur="5.25">long no it really doesn&amp;#39;t it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="194.53" dur="5.09">have to go through all these different</text>
  <text start="196.36" dur="7.56">things all you need is one gigantic</text>
  <text start="199.62" dur="7.15">distraction and this distraction could</text>
  <text start="203.92" dur="5.49">be a war it could be anything and when</text>
  <text start="206.77" dur="4.92">the new system is brought up they say by</text>
  <text start="209.41" dur="5.61">the way we&amp;#39;re on the petrol you one</text>
  <text start="211.69" dur="5.79">right now and China is the reserve</text>
  <text start="215.02" dur="4.62">currency that&amp;#39;s how quickly it happens</text>
  <text start="217.48" dur="4.71">there&amp;#39;s nothing else that needs to be</text>
  <text start="219.64" dur="4.47">done this is what happened I mean</text>
  <text start="222.19" dur="4.41">there&amp;#39;s inner workings but that&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="224.11" dur="7.08">much it this is what happened during</text>
  <text start="226.6" dur="6.27">World War two and then in the 70s yes</text>
  <text start="231.19" dur="5.91">they plan for it just like they plan for</text>
  <text start="232.87" dur="6.75">the petrol you won overnight the whole</text>
  <text start="237.1" dur="4.59">thing was switched yes for a couple of</text>
  <text start="239.62" dur="3.869">years things were pretty bad and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="241.69" dur="3.269">gonna see the same thing because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="243.489" dur="4.411">switching to a completely different</text>
  <text start="244.959" dur="6">system and we see that this whole thing</text>
  <text start="247.9" dur="5.309">is about to erupt now the real economy</text>
  <text start="250.959" dur="6">in the United States and around the</text>
  <text start="253.209" dur="6.301">world is come is declining very very</text>
  <text start="256.959" dur="4.831">rapidly it&amp;#39;s deteriorating it&amp;#39;s ripping</text>
  <text start="259.51" dur="4.59">ripping itself apart and all the</text>
  <text start="261.79" dur="5.16">illusionary numbers well they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="264.1" dur="5.19">working as well as they once did we see</text>
  <text start="266.95" dur="4.02">the Empire Fed Manufacturing survey it</text>
  <text start="269.29" dur="4.95">is tumbled four straight three straight</text>
  <text start="270.97" dur="4.77">months in a row and under the covers it</text>
  <text start="274.24" dur="3.81">was a complete disaster new orders</text>
  <text start="275.74" dur="4.59">plunging by nineteen to eleven point</text>
  <text start="278.05" dur="3.72">nine number of employees crashing from</text>
  <text start="280.33" dur="4.47">twenty two point nine to three point</text>
  <text start="281.77" dur="6.72">eight work hours cratering from nine</text>
  <text start="284.8" dur="5.7">point three to just point eight I mean</text>
  <text start="288.49" dur="4.26">this is just unbelievable and even the</text>
  <text start="290.5" dur="4.11">Fed the Boston Fed president Eric Rosen</text>
  <text start="292.75" dur="3.81">gren is out there and he&amp;#39;s concerned</text>
  <text start="294.61" dur="4.47">about potential asset bubbles in</text>
  <text start="296.56" dur="3.78">commercial real estate and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="299.08" dur="3.39">talking about commercial real estate</text>
  <text start="300.34" dur="3.45">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about real estate the</text>
  <text start="302.47" dur="3.48">same thing in commercial real estate</text>
  <text start="303.79" dur="3.09">that has been happening in regular real</text>
  <text start="305.95" dur="4.05">estate where they&amp;#39;re making these</text>
  <text start="306.88" dur="5.13">subprime security type of investment</text>
  <text start="310" dur="3.599">deals where they package everything</text>
  <text start="312.01" dur="4.71">together they&amp;#39;re doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="313.599" dur="4.261">that they did in 2008 with everyday real</text>
  <text start="316.72" dur="3.3">estate they&amp;#39;re doing it with</text>
  <text start="317.86" dur="4.14">commercial real estate today and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="320.02" dur="6.049">very worried about this and once again</text>
  <text start="322" dur="8.699">we&amp;#39;re seeing the same exact signs now</text>
  <text start="326.069" dur="7.541">Trump had a phone call with China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="330.699" dur="3.99">President Xi Jinping and they talked</text>
  <text start="333.61" dur="2.76">about all different things they talked</text>
  <text start="334.689" dur="5.371">about North Korea and things like that</text>
  <text start="336.37" dur="4.889">and Trump used the call to express his</text>
  <text start="340.06" dur="3.72">disappointment in the United States</text>
  <text start="341.259" dur="5.25">trade deficit with China has continued</text>
  <text start="343.78" dur="6.3">to grow and made it clear that this</text>
  <text start="346.509" dur="6.78">cannot be sustained and it is true that</text>
  <text start="350.08" dur="6.6">it is growing now of course what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="353.289" dur="8.1">seeing right now is the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="356.68" dur="7.769">end of the entire system and we need to</text>
  <text start="361.389" dur="6.571">look at the signals the signs that are</text>
  <text start="364.449" dur="9.15">being thrown at us now remember the</text>
  <text start="367.96" dur="8.819">petrol you won is now live and we know</text>
  <text start="373.599" dur="6.81">that Russia and China they have together</text>
  <text start="376.779" dur="5.13">created a real global alternative to the</text>
  <text start="380.409" dur="3.69">US dollar now this is part of the</text>
  <text start="381.909" dur="5.401">central bankers plan because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="384.099" dur="5.401">moving the system over to China it</text>
  <text start="387.31" dur="3.84">doesn&amp;#39;t seem like they are but they</text>
  <text start="389.5" dur="3.599">really are yes in the beginning what</text>
  <text start="391.15" dur="3.629">they do is they make it seem like this</text>
  <text start="393.099" dur="2.551">is going to be the the best thing since</text>
  <text start="394.779" dur="3.57">sliced bread</text>
  <text start="395.65" dur="4.979">where it&amp;#39;s all good for the people we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="398.349" dur="5.011">gonna have trade China&amp;#39;s creating the</text>
  <text start="400.629" dur="5.01">belt and Road this sounds fantastic and</text>
  <text start="403.36" dur="4.38">what they do is they wait for a number</text>
  <text start="405.639" dur="5.49">of years and then they take us off that</text>
  <text start="407.74" dur="4.979">system and the reason why China and</text>
  <text start="411.129" dur="4.35">Russia have been accumulating so much</text>
  <text start="412.719" dur="5.88">gold is because they need to restore</text>
  <text start="415.479" dur="5.521">confidence once the system breaks down</text>
  <text start="418.599" dur="4.68">this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the system is</text>
  <text start="421" dur="4.169">going to be backed by gold but as long</text>
  <text start="423.279" dur="4.741">as there is an insurance policy and they</text>
  <text start="425.169" dur="7.17">can show the gold to say hey listen we</text>
  <text start="428.02" dur="7.04">have the gold just in case the paper</text>
  <text start="432.339" dur="5.221">currency doesn&amp;#39;t work out we can back up</text>
  <text start="435.06" dur="6.99">everything and that&amp;#39;s all countries need</text>
  <text start="437.56" dur="7.379">to hear and see even though later on</text>
  <text start="442.05" dur="4.659">they won&amp;#39;t matter because this is what</text>
  <text start="444.939" dur="3.691">the central bank really wants they want</text>
  <text start="446.709" dur="4.98">complete control of the creation of</text>
  <text start="448.63" dur="5.159">currency and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="451.689" dur="5.01">that China&amp;#39;s weight in the crude oil</text>
  <text start="453.789" dur="4.53">market is not by itself sufficient to</text>
  <text start="456.699" dur="4.79">shake the global dominance of the</text>
  <text start="458.319" dur="7.05">petrodollar but I don&amp;#39;t think they need</text>
  <text start="461.489" dur="5.59">to be sufficient in the entire world</text>
  <text start="465.369" dur="3.06">right now where they have global</text>
  <text start="467.079" dur="1.92">dominance and they take over from the</text>
  <text start="468.429" dur="4.98">petrodollar</text>
  <text start="468.999" dur="7.5">all the central bankers need is an event</text>
  <text start="473.409" dur="5.76">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="476.499" dur="5.9">Germany central bank confirmed it would</text>
  <text start="479.169" dur="5.67">include China&amp;#39;s remember in its reserves</text>
  <text start="482.399" dur="4.84">Asian financial forum in Hong Kong on</text>
  <text start="484.839" dur="4.53">Monday said that the central bank had</text>
  <text start="487.239" dur="5.311">decided to include the RMB</text>
  <text start="489.369" dur="5.52">in their currency reserves now the</text>
  <text start="492.55" dur="4.799">inclusion in the German central bank</text>
  <text start="494.889" dur="4.92">reserve basket underscored China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="497.349" dur="6.511">increasing prominence in the global</text>
  <text start="499.809" dur="6.54">financial landscape and when we look at</text>
  <text start="503.86" dur="5.789">how the dollar has been doing compared</text>
  <text start="506.349" dur="6.18">to remember the remember has been stable</text>
  <text start="509.649" dur="6.901">and this is the yuan has been stable for</text>
  <text start="512.529" dur="7.8">18 months where the dollar has been very</text>
  <text start="516.55" dur="6.8">volatile and when countries look at this</text>
  <text start="520.329" dur="6.51">they say hmm which would I rather have a</text>
  <text start="523.35" dur="7.12">stable currency or a volatile currency</text>
  <text start="526.839" dur="5.97">and we see right now this is all part of</text>
  <text start="530.47" dur="5.099">the entire plan to make everyone</text>
  <text start="532.809" dur="5.161">convinced they need to move over to this</text>
  <text start="535.569" dur="4.921">new currency this is this is the whole</text>
  <text start="537.97" dur="5">plan being set up right now remember the</text>
  <text start="540.49" dur="5.73">whole things being set up and positioned</text>
  <text start="542.97" dur="5.919">for China to become the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="546.22" dur="4.589">now the local currency of each country</text>
  <text start="548.889" dur="3.57">that I don&amp;#39;t know if that has been</text>
  <text start="550.809" dur="3.78">decided it could be cryptocurrency it</text>
  <text start="552.459" dur="4.891">could be a central bank cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="554.589" dur="4.8">it could be electronic dollars and they</text>
  <text start="557.35" dur="4.62">might just reissue a new electronic</text>
  <text start="559.389" dur="5.401">currency we don&amp;#39;t know as of yet but</text>
  <text start="561.97" dur="5.429">what is but what we know for sure is</text>
  <text start="564.79" dur="6.479">that they&amp;#39;re going to blame this on</text>
  <text start="567.399" dur="5.61">Trump now why do I say this now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="571.269" dur="5.49">been saying this since he got elected</text>
  <text start="573.009" dur="7.711">and we know that they had to give him</text>
  <text start="576.759" dur="6.871">some time to be President to get his</text>
  <text start="580.72" dur="4.47">feet wet and to take responsibility for</text>
  <text start="583.63" dur="6.63">the economy</text>
  <text start="585.19" dur="7.71">and all they needed was economists or</text>
  <text start="590.26" dur="7.22">someone out there to say that this is</text>
  <text start="592.9" dur="8.22">Trump&amp;#39;s economy and it just happened</text>
  <text start="597.48" dur="7.51">economist they all agreed that this is</text>
  <text start="601.12" dur="6.45">no longer Obama&amp;#39;s economy it is Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="604.99" dur="5.64">economy and he should be congratulated</text>
  <text start="607.57" dur="5.13">and he should take a bow for getting the</text>
  <text start="610.63" dur="5.67">economy to where it is today the stock</text>
  <text start="612.7" dur="4.98">market at 26 thousand points everyone</text>

  <text start="617.68" dur="4.98">rate is down at four point one percent</text>
  <text start="620.19" dur="4.75">manufacturing is coming back to the</text>
  <text start="622.66" dur="4.5">country no none of this is actually true</text>
  <text start="624.94" dur="3.96">because what we&amp;#39;re really seeing in the</text>
  <text start="627.16" dur="3.93">economy and we&amp;#39;ve been delving deep into</text>
  <text start="628.9" dur="4.32">these numbers is that the economy is</text>
  <text start="631.09" dur="4.41">actually falling apart it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="633.22" dur="4.95">improving people aren&amp;#39;t getting better</text>
  <text start="635.5" dur="6">jobs people aren&amp;#39;t getting jobs actually</text>
  <text start="638.17" dur="4.95">just in the last month or so thousands</text>
  <text start="641.5" dur="3.84">upon thousands of being told that</text>
  <text start="643.12" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re gonna be laid off we see out in</text>
  <text start="645.34" dur="5.81">the UK this construction firm you know</text>
  <text start="649.21" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re gonna be letting go around what</text>
  <text start="651.15" dur="6.91">43,000 people worldwide the whole thing</text>
  <text start="654.85" dur="4.83">is falling apart right now and what the</text>
  <text start="658.06" dur="3.21">central bankers are doing right now is</text>
  <text start="659.68" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re setting everything up because</text>
  <text start="661.27" dur="5.85">look they have the pivot away from the</text>
  <text start="664.42" dur="5.43">dollar it&amp;#39;s already starting banks banks</text>

  <text start="675.06" dur="6.07">this doesn&amp;#39;t need to take a huge amount</text>
  <text start="678.97" dur="4.47">of time it doesn&amp;#39;t need to take years</text>
  <text start="681.13" dur="4.32">and years and years because the central</text>
  <text start="683.44" dur="3.69">bankers what they do is they set</text>
  <text start="685.45" dur="3.96">everything up they put everything into</text>
  <text start="687.13" dur="5.34">position and then they have some type of</text>
  <text start="689.41" dur="4.98">an event and when all said and done this</text>
  <text start="692.47" dur="4.35">most likely it&amp;#39;s going to be a war when</text>
  <text start="694.39" dur="7.08">we&amp;#39;re all said and done what they do is</text>
  <text start="696.82" dur="8.13">then say look the war it completely</text>
  <text start="701.47" dur="5.13">devastated the old financial system it</text>
  <text start="704.95" dur="4.23">looks like goal it looks like China and</text>
  <text start="706.6" dur="3.69">Russia they have the gold and this is</text>
  <text start="709.18" dur="4.59">assuming that they&amp;#39;re going to win the</text>
  <text start="710.29" dur="6.77">war they have the manufacturing they</text>
  <text start="713.77" dur="5.07">have everything that they need and</text>
  <text start="717.06" dur="2.92">basically</text>
  <text start="718.84" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;re going to do is we&amp;#39;re gonna move</text>
  <text start="719.98" dur="3.66">the system and have you wanna become the</text>
  <text start="722.41" dur="2.88">reserve currency because looks like they</text>
  <text start="723.64" dur="4.14">have the petrol you wan they have all</text>
  <text start="725.29" dur="4.77">the investment systems all set up</text>
  <text start="727.78" dur="4.98">they have everything ready to go and the</text>
  <text start="730.06" dur="4.83">old dollar system that&amp;#39;s done with it we</text>
  <text start="732.76" dur="4.23">can&amp;#39;t do anything with it and then all</text>
  <text start="734.89" dur="4.8">of a sudden we&amp;#39;re on this new system</text>
  <text start="736.99" dur="4.86">countries get together more gold is</text>
  <text start="739.69" dur="5.16">introduced into the system for</text>
  <text start="741.85" dur="4.68">confidence and we&amp;#39;re off and running I</text>
  <text start="744.85" dur="3.63">mean this is pretty much what happened</text>
  <text start="746.53" dur="4.71">during World War two</text>
  <text start="748.48" dur="5.82">Bretton Woods and the central banks</text>
  <text start="751.24" dur="5.13">would then have control of the new</text>
  <text start="754.3" dur="4.14">system now in the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="756.37" dur="4.74">system it&amp;#39;s gonna feel great because</text>
  <text start="758.44" dur="5.46">there&amp;#39;s not much debt Manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="761.11" dur="6.48">ready to go all the country is gonna</text>
  <text start="763.9" dur="6.99">have to rebuild from the what has</text>
  <text start="767.59" dur="5.46">happened the population is reduced so</text>
  <text start="770.89" dur="5.79">you don&amp;#39;t need that much debt out there</text>
  <text start="773.05" dur="6.96">it&amp;#39;s all backed by the confidence of</text>
  <text start="776.68" dur="4.98">gold and the central bankers have their</text>
  <text start="780.01" dur="2.73">control and the reason why I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="781.66" dur="2.1">they&amp;#39;re going to back it with gold is</text>
  <text start="782.74" dur="3.33">because they&amp;#39;re gonna use the same</text>
  <text start="783.76" dur="4.89">scheme of the petrol you want just like</text>
  <text start="786.07" dur="4.53">the petro dollar and it looks like they</text>
  <text start="788.65" dur="4.62">have the ability to do this before they</text>
  <text start="790.6" dur="4.17">didn&amp;#39;t have this ability because they</text>
  <text start="793.27" dur="3.27">were just backing everything by gold and</text>
  <text start="794.77" dur="4.44">I think this time they&amp;#39;re gonna use gold</text>
  <text start="796.54" dur="5.07">as the confidence booster and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="799.21" dur="4.32">gonna back it by the petrol you want and</text>
  <text start="801.61" dur="4.05">this what this means is all these</text>
  <text start="803.53" dur="3.57">countries and this is why China and</text>
  <text start="805.66" dur="3.87">Russia are moving into the Middle East</text>
  <text start="807.1" dur="5.31">and the u.s. is leaving accept the Cabal</text>
  <text start="809.53" dur="4.2">wants to keep control of their system</text>
  <text start="812.41" dur="2.57">they make a lot of money off this and</text>
  <text start="813.73" dur="3.96">they don&amp;#39;t want to see this go and</text>
  <text start="814.98" dur="5.14">they&amp;#39;re fighting to keep it but what</text>
  <text start="817.69" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is everything is</text>
  <text start="820.12" dur="4.11">falling into place</text>
  <text start="822.13" dur="5.76">and we&amp;#39;ll be talking about what the</text>
  <text start="824.23" dur="5.94">Cabal is trying to do in the political</text>
  <text start="827.89" dur="4.56">geopolitical report because you can see</text>
  <text start="830.17" dur="4.95">they are really pushing their agenda so</text>
  <text start="832.45" dur="4.71">this new transition is headed our way we</text>
  <text start="835.12" dur="4.92">don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s going to be done with</text>
  <text start="837.16" dur="5.46">a distraction if trump is going to beat</text>
  <text start="840.04" dur="3.81">the central bank to the punch line where</text>
  <text start="842.62" dur="3.66">he&amp;#39;s going to bring the system down</text>
  <text start="843.85" dur="3.93">blame it on the central bank and maybe</text>
  <text start="846.28" dur="3.6">take control of the system this is why</text>
  <text start="847.78" dur="4.83">he has Andrew Jackson once again hanging</text>
  <text start="849.88" dur="4.98">in his office because this is the move</text>
  <text start="852.61" dur="4.02">the Patriots behind Trump this is what</text>
  <text start="854.86" dur="4.289">they&amp;#39;re trying to do this is their move</text>
  <text start="856.63" dur="5.04">that they&amp;#39;re trying to make now again it</text>
  <text start="859.149" dur="3.901">is a race to the finish line on who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="861.67" dur="3.99">going to take control of the entire</text>
  <text start="863.05" dur="5.849">system but one thing we know for sure is</text>
  <text start="865.66" dur="6.359">that we will eventually go into some</text>
  <text start="868.899" dur="4.711">type of transition because the dollar</text>
  <text start="872.019" dur="3.991">will no longer be the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="873.61" dur="5.24">it will transition to something</text>
  <text start="876.01" dur="5.19">completely different again we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="878.85" dur="3.669">exactly how it&amp;#39;s going to turn out it</text>
  <text start="881.2" dur="3.18">all depends on who the winner is going</text>
  <text start="882.519" dur="4.921">to be but there will be tough times</text>
  <text start="884.38" dur="6.209">ahead look what happened when we were</text>
  <text start="887.44" dur="5.04">coming off the gold standard in 1970 we</text>
  <text start="890.589" dur="4.141">couldn&amp;#39;t get oil because the system was</text>
  <text start="892.48" dur="4.44">the new system was coming online but it</text>
  <text start="894.73" dur="4.5">was still the dollar it was still the</text>
  <text start="896.92" dur="4.169">reserve currency of the world but look</text>
  <text start="899.23" dur="4.32">people were out of work in the 70s</text>
  <text start="901.089" dur="4.351">people had trouble there was huge</text>
  <text start="903.55" dur="4.38">inflation because we came off the gold</text>
  <text start="905.44" dur="4.86">standard that was the positive part</text>
  <text start="907.93" dur="4.71">because it made people&amp;#39;s houses move up</text>
  <text start="910.3" dur="4.11">salaries move up and things like that</text>
  <text start="912.64" dur="4.59">people were able to put their funds in</text>
  <text start="914.41" dur="5.73">the bank CD&amp;#39;s get you know 16 17 18</text>
  <text start="917.23" dur="5.099">percent of interest when you&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="920.14" dur="4.889">on to a new system it&amp;#39;s fantastic when</text>
  <text start="922.329" dur="5.94">you&amp;#39;re coming off of the system where</text>
  <text start="925.029" dur="5.611">it&amp;#39;s all built on debt this and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="928.269" dur="4.56">moving someplace else this is the hard</text>
  <text start="930.64" dur="4.08">part so no matter what we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="932.829" dur="3.601">going through some type of transition</text>
  <text start="934.72" dur="5.16">and it looks like we&amp;#39;re getting closer</text>
  <text start="936.43" dur="5.13">and closer to that time listen everyone</text>
  <text start="939.88" dur="3.99">thanks a lot for listening be well be</text>
