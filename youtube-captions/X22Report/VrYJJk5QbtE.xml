  <text start="50.39" dur="4.53">to talk about cue and those people that</text>
  <text start="53.089" dur="3.691">have been following cue ever since cue</text>
  <text start="54.92" dur="3.84">first appeared we&amp;#39;ve learned the truth</text>
  <text start="56.78" dur="4.32">behind the deep state and its attempt to</text>

  <text start="92.479" dur="4.771">just come out and fight against Trump</text>
  <text start="94.939" dur="2.911">this is not how the central bank system</text>
  <text start="97.25" dur="3.299">works</text>
  <text start="97.85" dur="5.129">remember the central bank they like to</text>
  <text start="100.549" dur="5.761">hide behind the curtain and they like to</text>
  <text start="102.979" dur="5.64">use other mouthpieces to do their dirty</text>
  <text start="106.31" dur="5.58">work and this is the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="108.619" dur="6.721">certain politicians and they use these</text>
  <text start="111.89" dur="5.759">people to push their agendas they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="115.34" dur="5.01">never come out from the shadows and</text>
  <text start="117.649" dur="5.76">start screaming and yelling at the</text>
  <text start="120.35" dur="5.339">president or anyone else they like to be</text>
  <text start="123.409" dur="5.091">they like to stay hidden they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="125.689" dur="5.011">people to know that they even exists and</text>
  <text start="128.5" dur="5.829">they just want to go about their</text>
  <text start="130.7" dur="6.96">business behind the scenes why because</text>
  <text start="134.329" dur="6.921">if people catch on and people understand</text>
  <text start="137.66" dur="9.21">what they really do well guess what</text>
  <text start="141.25" dur="7.45">people are not going to like it when the</text>
  <text start="146.87" dur="5.239">mainstream media comes out and they talk</text>
  <text start="148.7" dur="8.22">about the wealthiest people in America</text>
  <text start="152.109" dur="5.881">they talk about movie stars or Buffett</text>
  <text start="156.92" dur="4.86">or</text>
  <text start="157.99" dur="6.79">Bill Gates from Microsoft they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="161.78" dur="7.32">the wealthiest in the world it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="164.78" dur="7.77">central bank establishment those people</text>
  <text start="169.1" dur="5.76">that are running the central banks the</text>
  <text start="172.55" dur="5.37">Rothschilds they have trillions</text>
  <text start="174.86" dur="4.89">why aren&amp;#39;t they mentioned when they say</text>
  <text start="177.92" dur="4.2">these are the wealthiest people around</text>
  <text start="179.75" dur="6.21">the world they kind of leave those</text>
  <text start="182.12" dur="5.4">people out why because those people are</text>
  <text start="185.96" dur="3.09">behind the curtain they want to stay</text>
  <text start="187.52" dur="4.71">there they want to stay in the shadows</text>
  <text start="189.05" dur="6.21">and they push everyone else into the</text>
  <text start="192.23" dur="4.89">front the founding fathers Andrew</text>
  <text start="195.26" dur="4.59">Jackson and many others they all knew</text>
  <text start="197.12" dur="7.11">about this they all knew that the</text>
  <text start="199.85" dur="6.75">central bank that is not good for the</text>
  <text start="204.23" dur="6.06">people they all knew that the central</text>
  <text start="206.6" dur="8.61">bank would damage America would damage</text>
  <text start="210.29" dur="8.34">the world and this is why Trump has</text>
  <text start="215.21" dur="6.84">Andrew Jackson on the wall in the White</text>
  <text start="218.63" dur="6.27">House because his main operation when</text>
  <text start="222.05" dur="6.75">all is said and done is to go after the</text>
  <text start="224.9" dur="6.99">central bank system you ever wonder why</text>
  <text start="228.8" dur="7.11">the Fed the central bank&amp;#39;s usually come</text>
  <text start="231.89" dur="7.59">out and say tariffs aren&amp;#39;t good it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="235.91" dur="6.299">good for the world economy think about</text>
  <text start="239.48" dur="7.289">it for a second why do central banks</text>
  <text start="242.209" dur="8.191">hate tariffs because it gives leverage</text>
  <text start="246.769" dur="7.651">over another country it enables a</text>
  <text start="250.4" dur="7.73">country to work out a better deal than</text>
  <text start="254.42" dur="7.46">what the globalists have planned</text>
  <text start="258.13" dur="6.67">what is Trump doing he&amp;#39;s using tariffs</text>
  <text start="261.88" dur="6.31">the central banks don&amp;#39;t like tariffs</text>
  <text start="264.8" dur="8.64">they equate that to trade wars they</text>
  <text start="268.19" dur="9.51">equate that to the economic world growth</text>
  <text start="273.44" dur="6.06">slowing now they do this on purpose it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.7" dur="4.32">called a form of brainwashing to make</text>
  <text start="279.5" dur="4.97">you think that because of these tariffs</text>
  <text start="282.02" dur="5.85">we&amp;#39;re gonna have major major problems</text>
  <text start="284.47" dur="6.069">now what&amp;#39;s really happening is the</text>
  <text start="287.87" dur="3.9">central bank system is slowing and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="290.539" dur="3.78">shown this many many times</text>
  <text start="291.77" dur="5.73">before every time the IMF was out there</text>
  <text start="294.319" dur="8.25">and they&amp;#39;re projecting this GDP number</text>
  <text start="297.5" dur="7.47">of 3.5% 3.2 percent they never hit it it</text>
  <text start="302.569" dur="5.31">declines every single time and it&amp;#39;s much</text>
  <text start="304.97" dur="5.49">lower each time they&amp;#39;re on a downward</text>
  <text start="307.879" dur="5.78">trajectory and there weren&amp;#39;t entering</text>
  <text start="310.46" dur="8.25">any tariffs during this period of time</text>
  <text start="313.659" dur="7.961">and Trump is going against the central</text>
  <text start="318.71" dur="7.4">bank using tariffs but he&amp;#39;s setting them</text>
  <text start="321.62" dur="7.26">up all at the same time tariffs</text>
  <text start="326.11" dur="5.85">interfere with the globalist plan the</text>
  <text start="328.88" dur="6.15">globalist plan is to control trade</text>
  <text start="331.96" dur="4.63">control trade so they can have a</text>
  <text start="335.03" dur="4.47">one-world government</text>
  <text start="336.59" dur="5.19">remember they don&amp;#39;t want one nation</text>
  <text start="339.5" dur="5.069">doing better than another nation they</text>
  <text start="341.78" dur="6.3">want all nations completely equal under</text>
  <text start="344.569" dur="5.761">their system that&amp;#39;s how they want it</text>
  <text start="348.08" dur="6.69">because this way they can control</text>
  <text start="350.33" dur="9.119">everything tariffs make it difficult to</text>
  <text start="354.77" dur="6.989">put their plan forward if Trump is using</text>
  <text start="359.449" dur="5.46">tariffs to make a better deal than them</text>
  <text start="361.759" dur="6.15">what they laid out what happens when the</text>
  <text start="364.909" dur="6.271">world looks at this think about the UK</text>
  <text start="367.909" dur="5.82">for example the brexit when they break</text>
  <text start="371.18" dur="6.239">away from the EU and they start doing</text>
  <text start="373.729" dur="6.03">really really well how is the central</text>
  <text start="377.419" dur="5.881">bank going to explain this if Trump uses</text>
  <text start="379.759" dur="6.66">tariffs to make a better deal and trade</text>
  <text start="383.3" dur="4.709">is better for the United States how do</text>
  <text start="386.419" dur="4.351">the globalist out of the central bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="388.009" dur="5.431">how do they explain this remember the</text>
  <text start="390.77" dur="5.88">central banks their main interest is not</text>
  <text start="393.44" dur="5.96">to help the American people it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="396.65" dur="5.009">Hat to help the people around the world</text>
  <text start="399.4" dur="4.81">their main interest is to help</text>
  <text start="401.659" dur="7.521">themselves that&amp;#39;s what the central bank</text>
  <text start="404.21" dur="9.049">is all about now the central bank</text>
  <text start="409.18" dur="6.01">they&amp;#39;re hostile to a self-governing</text>
  <text start="413.259" dur="4.921">Society this is coming out of the</text>
  <text start="415.19" dur="6.089">American Institute for Economic Research</text>
  <text start="418.18" dur="5.68">monetary policy as a practice by central</text>
  <text start="421.279" dur="3.89">bank&amp;#39;s violates all three of our</text>
  <text start="423.86" dur="3.619">democratic</text>
  <text start="425.169" dur="4.74">seems it&amp;#39;s no surprise then that the</text>
  <text start="427.479" dur="4.77">central bankers across the world exhibit</text>
  <text start="429.909" dur="4.35">a combination of features that fill</text>
  <text start="432.249" dur="4.651">sophisticated political thinkers with</text>
  <text start="434.259" dur="5.641">dread maximum power subject to minimal</text>
  <text start="436.9" dur="5.34">responsibility to be a monetary policy</text>
  <text start="439.9" dur="3.78">maker today is to be empowered to affect</text>
  <text start="442.24" dur="4.259">the material livelihoods of millions</text>
  <text start="443.68" dur="5.639">across the globe with scant consequences</text>
  <text start="446.499" dur="4.2">should that authority be misused there</text>
  <text start="449.319" dur="3.12">are many many ways to change the</text>
  <text start="450.699" dur="4.171">institutional foundation of central</text>
  <text start="452.439" dur="4.53">bank&amp;#39;s to mitigate these problems which</text>
  <text start="454.87" dur="4.019">should be pursued is a complicated</text>
  <text start="456.969" dur="4.35">question that itself should be put to</text>
  <text start="458.889" dur="4.981">public debate not decided behind closed</text>
  <text start="461.319" dur="6.27">doors among a small group of experts the</text>
  <text start="463.87" dur="5.609">one certainty is that monetary policy as</text>
  <text start="467.589" dur="3.811">it currently operates fails to meet</text>
  <text start="469.479" dur="4.62">minimal standards of public</text>
  <text start="471.4" dur="5.189">responsibility and competence if we are</text>
  <text start="474.099" dur="5.481">at all committed to self-governance it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="476.589" dur="7.711">time for this to end</text>
  <text start="479.58" dur="7.949">absolutely and president Jackson he knew</text>
  <text start="484.3" dur="6.479">this he knew the central bank system is</text>
  <text start="487.529" dur="4.721">not good for the American people why do</text>
  <text start="490.779" dur="4.281">you think the central bankers wanted him</text>
  <text start="492.25" dur="6.539">removed from the $20 bill because he</text>
  <text start="495.06" dur="8.139">represents a president that removed the</text>
  <text start="498.789" dur="6.9">central bank now back in July 10th 1832</text>
  <text start="503.199" dur="5.011">in his veto message regarding the Bank</text>
  <text start="505.689" dur="4.59">of the United States there&amp;#39;s a paragraph</text>
  <text start="508.21" dur="4.439">in there I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s long but</text>
  <text start="510.279" dur="4.56">there&amp;#39;s a paragraph in there that kind</text>
  <text start="512.649" dur="3.69">of sums up pretty much everything that</text>
  <text start="514.839" dur="4.26">has to do with the central bank and why</text>
  <text start="516.339" dur="6">he removed the central bank he said it</text>
  <text start="519.099" dur="5.821">is maintained by some that the bank is a</text>
  <text start="522.339" dur="4.771">means of executing the constitutional</text>
  <text start="524.92" dur="5.49">power to coin money and regulate the</text>
  <text start="527.11" dur="6.3">value thereof Congress have established</text>
  <text start="530.41" dur="5.97">a mint to coin money and passed laws to</text>
  <text start="533.41" dur="5.549">regulate the value thereof the money so</text>
  <text start="536.38" dur="5.1">coin with its value so regulated and</text>
  <text start="538.959" dur="4.531">such foreign coins as Congress may adopt</text>
  <text start="541.48" dur="4.32">are the only currency known to the</text>
  <text start="543.49" dur="5.25">Constitution but if they have other</text>
  <text start="545.8" dur="5.64">power to regulate the currency it was</text>
  <text start="548.74" dur="4.86">conferred to be exercised by themselves</text>
  <text start="551.44" dur="4.649">and not to be transferred to a</text>
  <text start="553.6" dur="5.01">corporation if the bank be established</text>
  <text start="556.089" dur="5.281">for that purpose with a charter on</text>
  <text start="558.61" dur="5.88">alterable without its consent Congress</text>
  <text start="561.37" dur="5.07">have parted their power for a term of</text>
  <text start="564.49" dur="3.33">years during which the Constitution is a</text>
  <text start="566.44" dur="4.139">dead letter</text>
  <text start="567.82" dur="5.85">it is neither necessary nor proper to</text>
  <text start="570.579" dur="7.07">transfer its legislative power to such a</text>
  <text start="573.67" dur="3.979">bank and therefore unconstitutional</text>
  <text start="578.55" dur="6.81">Trump is going to be going after the</text>
  <text start="582.31" dur="6.18">central bank just like Andrew Jackson</text>
  <text start="585.36" dur="5.11">because Trump and Andrew Jackson and the</text>
  <text start="588.49" dur="5.599">founding fathers before all of these</text>
  <text start="590.47" dur="8.489">individuals even Kennedy they all knew</text>
  <text start="594.089" dur="8.411">the central bank is the source of the</text>
  <text start="598.959" dur="5.611">problem is the source of the problem not</text>
  <text start="602.5" dur="6.899">just here in the United States but</text>
  <text start="604.57" dur="9.84">around the world and it is time that</text>
  <text start="609.399" dur="7.44">Congress take this power back now can we</text>
  <text start="614.41" dur="5.85">do it with the members of Congress today</text>
  <text start="616.839" dur="5.31">absolutely not the members of Congress</text>
  <text start="620.26" dur="4.62">today with their very very very low</text>
  <text start="622.149" dur="3.841">rating they are not working for the</text>
  <text start="624.88" dur="5.34">American people</text>
  <text start="625.99" dur="6.599">they are not interested in helping the</text>
  <text start="630.22" dur="5.03">American people looking out for the</text>
  <text start="632.589" dur="4.521">American people they&amp;#39;re interested in</text>
  <text start="635.25" dur="5.5">themselves</text>
  <text start="637.11" dur="5.14">now do I mean the entire Congress now</text>
  <text start="640.75" dur="3.839">there are small pockets of individuals</text>
  <text start="642.25" dur="4.92">that really care about the American</text>
  <text start="644.589" dur="7.051">people but the majority of Congress they</text>
  <text start="647.17" dur="6.93">do not and they will never go after the</text>
  <text start="651.64" dur="3.09">central bank they won&amp;#39;t even ask for an</text>
  <text start="654.1" dur="3.57">audit</text>
  <text start="654.73" dur="5.609">how many audit bills have been brought</text>
  <text start="657.67" dur="5.279">up and how many have been shot down</text>
  <text start="660.339" dur="7.341">how many audits have we had of the</text>
  <text start="662.949" dur="8.941">central bank since 1913 if Congress</text>
  <text start="667.68" dur="8.8">truly cared about the people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="671.89" dur="6.389">well-being really cared about the</text>
  <text start="676.48" dur="6.45">financial well-being of the United</text>
  <text start="678.279" dur="9.17">States of America Congress would have</text>
  <text start="682.93" dur="6.94">audited the Fed not once but multiple</text>
  <text start="687.449" dur="6.301">multiple times</text>
  <text start="689.87" dur="6.73">this is a clear indicator that Congress</text>
  <text start="693.75" dur="6.9">is being pushed in a certain direction</text>
  <text start="696.6" dur="7.38">away from the central bank and how are</text>
  <text start="700.65" dur="6.57">they being pushed away by making them</text>
  <text start="703.98" dur="6.72">wealthy by using this free easy money</text>
  <text start="707.22" dur="4.92">created by the central bank now I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="710.7" dur="3.27">saying the central bank says here we</text>
  <text start="712.14" dur="3.57">just printed up some money here you go</text>
  <text start="713.97" dur="3.66">good luck maybe that started way way</text>
  <text start="715.71" dur="4.17">back in the beginning when Woodrow</text>
  <text start="717.63" dur="5.04">Wilson signed the bill where they paid</text>
  <text start="719.88" dur="7.41">him off but today they do it in a</text>
  <text start="722.67" dur="7.73">different way so nobody can tell how</text>
  <text start="727.29" dur="8.85">they&amp;#39;re getting paid off they create</text>
  <text start="730.4" dur="8.74">programs they ask for funds the central</text>
  <text start="736.14" dur="6.29">bank continually creates the United</text>
  <text start="739.14" dur="5.91">States borrows the funds disappear and</text>
  <text start="742.43" dur="5.41">all of a sudden these people become very</text>

  <text start="788.46" dur="6.06">person to understand what the central</text>
  <text start="792.45" dur="4.55">bank is to understand that we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="794.52" dur="6.66">a central bank to create currency</text>

  <text start="855.15" dur="4.02">to know about the central bank why do</text>
  <text start="856.95" dur="4.97">you think the mainstream media defends</text>
  <text start="859.17" dur="7.14">the central bank because it&amp;#39;s part of</text>
  <text start="861.92" dur="8.08">the entire apparatus you remove the</text>
  <text start="866.31" dur="6.21">central bank you remove the funds you</text>

  <text start="897.44" dur="7">because there&amp;#39;s no interest on the money</text>
  <text start="900.92" dur="6.4">we collect taxes today to pay for that</text>
  <text start="904.44" dur="6.48">interest which the taxes aren&amp;#39;t even</text>
