  <text start="76.98" dur="3.66">system now remember we&amp;#39;ve said this</text>
  <text start="78.69" dur="5.4">before but the central banking system</text>
  <text start="80.64" dur="6.24">was not designed to go this long they</text>
  <text start="84.09" dur="6.029">wanted an event so they could say hey</text>

  <text start="99.3" dur="4.83">is why the system is failing right now</text>
  <text start="101.85" dur="5.7">this is why we&amp;#39;re in a recession this is</text>
  <text start="104.13" dur="5.43">why we don&amp;#39;t see supplies coming in the</text>
  <text start="107.55" dur="5.31">problem is we don&amp;#39;t have that right now</text>
  <text start="109.56" dur="5.76">and what is happening is we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="112.86" dur="5.55">through this major major transition and</text>
  <text start="115.32" dur="5.999">it&amp;#39;s not just an economic transition</text>
  <text start="118.41" dur="5.7">it&amp;#39;s a transition that involves</text>
  <text start="121.319" dur="5.071">government the deep state and everything</text>
  <text start="124.11" dur="6.03">else that we&amp;#39;ve known for a very long</text>
  <text start="126.39" dur="6.33">time this is going to be the biggest</text>
  <text start="130.14" dur="6.12">transition that we&amp;#39;ve seen in our</text>
  <text start="132.72" dur="5.88">lifetime and it&amp;#39;s going to be huge and</text>
  <text start="136.26" dur="6.12">what is happening right now is the</text>
  <text start="138.6" dur="5.99">economic system it is breaking down very</text>
  <text start="142.38" dur="5.31">rapidly right now yes</text>
  <text start="144.59" dur="5.14">Trump is putting out the numbers from</text>
  <text start="147.69" dur="3.3">government saying the economy&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="149.73" dur="7.08">well he&amp;#39;s saying the economy&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="150.99" dur="9.21">well this is a strategy to show that hey</text>
  <text start="156.81" dur="5.64">the economy&amp;#39;s doing well and the central</text>
  <text start="160.2" dur="5.67">bank is going to destroy it he&amp;#39;s used</text>
  <text start="162.45" dur="5.22">this strategy in all different aspects</text>
  <text start="165.87" dur="4.5">of his presidency</text>
  <text start="167.67" dur="5.76">we saw it with North Korea we saw it</text>
  <text start="170.37" dur="4.86">with what we&amp;#39;re seeing with Iran we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="173.43" dur="4.139">seeing it with Syria we&amp;#39;re seeing it</text>
  <text start="175.23" dur="3.57">with Afghanistan we&amp;#39;re seeing how he</text>
  <text start="177.569" dur="3.03">plays with the deep state and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="178.8" dur="4.71">going to be going into this into the</text>
  <text start="180.599" dur="4.981">next report about this mirroring and</text>
  <text start="183.51" dur="3.51">what is happening right now because it</text>
  <text start="185.58" dur="3.72">involves everything this is not</text>
  <text start="187.02" dur="3.69">just one little thing of putting the</text>
  <text start="189.3" dur="6.24">clintons in jail and things like that</text>
  <text start="190.71" dur="7.89">but when we look at the economic system</text>
  <text start="195.54" dur="4.73">right now we look at all different</text>
  <text start="198.6" dur="4.16">indicators and all the indicators</text>
  <text start="200.27" dur="5.83">they&amp;#39;re not looking good right now and</text>
  <text start="202.76" dur="5.62">if we look at durable goods right now we</text>
  <text start="206.1" dur="4.68">see that durable good orders in July</text>
  <text start="208.38" dur="5.43">well they dropped by 1.7 percent the</text>
  <text start="210.78" dur="6.39">most since January core durable goods</text>
  <text start="213.81" dur="7.29">orders and if you exclude transportation</text>
  <text start="217.17" dur="6.51">they also missed expectations rising</text>
  <text start="221.1" dur="6.54">only 0.2% month a month first economist</text>
  <text start="223.68" dur="6.59">best guess of 0.5% gain when we look at</text>
  <text start="227.64" dur="5.85">the US macroeconomic data well that</text>
  <text start="230.27" dur="5.23">disappoints and it doesn&amp;#39;t look good so</text>
  <text start="233.49" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;re looking at the u.s. macro surprise</text>
  <text start="235.5" dur="4.62">index and we&amp;#39;re reaching the point of</text>
  <text start="237.75" dur="7.56">where we were right before</text>
  <text start="240.12" dur="9.3">the recession in 2008 this does not look</text>
  <text start="245.31" dur="7.89">good at all throw on top of that we are</text>
  <text start="249.42" dur="5.91">seeing the yield curve well that is</text>
  <text start="253.2" dur="4.98">flattening and most likely will invert</text>
  <text start="255.33" dur="6.06">actually the yield curve has tumbled now</text>
  <text start="258.18" dur="9.3">below Japan&amp;#39;s for the first time in 11</text>
  <text start="261.39" dur="8.52">years this is not a good sign so the</text>
  <text start="267.48" dur="4.68">yield curve was like this back in 2007</text>
  <text start="269.91" dur="5.52">what happened in 2008 we went into a</text>
  <text start="272.16" dur="6.45">recession we know that the Fed wants to</text>
  <text start="275.43" dur="5.85">change the calculation on how we</text>
  <text start="278.61" dur="3.99">calculate the yield curve because</text>
  <text start="281.28" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s not a good indicator</text>
  <text start="282.6" dur="4.5">of a recession but they&amp;#39;re really saying</text>
  <text start="284.85" dur="3.57">is this is an incredible indicator of a</text>
  <text start="287.1" dur="3.72">recession and we don&amp;#39;t want people to</text>
  <text start="288.42" dur="4.68">know what&amp;#39;s going on here we need to</text>
  <text start="290.82" dur="6.57">understand that everything that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="293.1" dur="7.59">seeing the tariffs with China this is</text>
  <text start="297.39" dur="4.8">not a trade war I know the corporate</text>
  <text start="300.69" dur="3.57">media is out there saying Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.19" dur="5.01">starting a trade war we&amp;#39;re getting into</text>
  <text start="304.26" dur="6.72">it with China this is being done on</text>
  <text start="307.2" dur="7.35">purpose and yes China is in on this</text>
  <text start="310.98" dur="6.8">Russia is in on this all the big players</text>
  <text start="314.55" dur="6.3">are in on this it&amp;#39;s a coordinated effort</text>
  <text start="317.78" dur="5.74">to bring down the central bank</text>
  <text start="320.85" dur="5.34">the central banking establishment so</text>
  <text start="323.52" dur="6.3">when we look at this this is all being</text>
  <text start="326.19" dur="6.87">done at the same time that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="329.82" dur="6.48">after the deep state Russia and China</text>
  <text start="333.06" dur="5.28">they know all about this they know</text>
  <text start="336.3" dur="5.04">everything that&amp;#39;s going on they know</text>
  <text start="338.34" dur="5.28">exactly what&amp;#39;s happening and the</text>
  <text start="341.34" dur="6.78">strategy that is being used right now is</text>
  <text start="343.62" dur="6.33">the strategy of sunsoo and it&amp;#39;s also the</text>
  <text start="348.12" dur="3.57">strategy of mirroring which we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="349.95" dur="2.61">to be getting to getting into in the</text>
  <text start="351.69" dur="2.73">next report</text>
  <text start="352.56" dur="6">so everything that we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="354.42" dur="6.93">right now is being done on purpose the</text>
  <text start="358.56" dur="6.62">bilateral trade agreements the tariffs</text>
  <text start="361.35" dur="7.83">because what they&amp;#39;re doing is they are</text>
  <text start="365.18" dur="5.92">forcing the old system out and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="369.18" dur="4.79">bringing in the new system and the only</text>
  <text start="371.1" dur="6.77">way to do this is to coordinate together</text>
  <text start="373.97" dur="7.65">all at the same time to break apart</text>
  <text start="377.87" dur="5.92">their globalist trading system and</text>
  <text start="381.62" dur="4.6">that&amp;#39;s exactly what&amp;#39;s happening right</text>
  <text start="383.79" dur="3.99">now this is why the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="386.22" dur="3.24">out there this is why the central bank</text>
  <text start="387.78" dur="3.87">the IMF they&amp;#39;re all out there saying</text>
  <text start="389.46" dur="4.26">global growth is going to slow this is</text>
  <text start="391.65" dur="4.26">not a good sign this is not good for the</text>
  <text start="393.72" dur="6.18">economy this is not good for their</text>
  <text start="395.91" dur="6.45">economy the system that they set up now</text>
  <text start="399.9" dur="6.18">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that in</text>
  <text start="402.36" dur="5.73">Russia there was a fire in the central</text>
  <text start="406.08" dur="3.72">bank now we know that Putin took over</text>
  <text start="408.09" dur="3.63">the central bank now it&amp;#39;s still a</text>
  <text start="409.8" dur="5.34">private western central bank but he</text>
  <text start="411.72" dur="4.65">controls it he tells them what to do but</text>
  <text start="415.14" dur="4.85">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that 10</text>
  <text start="416.37" dur="7.76">months before this fire in Russia</text>
  <text start="419.99" dur="7.51">the New York Fed building caught on fire</text>
  <text start="424.13" dur="7.3">so is this a message to the central</text>
  <text start="427.5" dur="7.77">bank&amp;#39;s letting them know that hey you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="431.43" dur="7.07">done with your reign of terror is over I</text>
  <text start="435.27" dur="5.49">mean is this a coincidence that two</text>
  <text start="438.5" dur="3.55">central bank buildings with all their</text>
  <text start="440.76" dur="4.11">safeguards and everything they have</text>
  <text start="442.05" dur="7.68">they&amp;#39;re caught on fire does that make</text>
  <text start="444.87" dur="6.84">any sense no it really does not so when</text>
  <text start="449.73" dur="3.81">we look at all of this and we put all</text>
  <text start="451.71" dur="5.04">the pieces together</text>
  <text start="453.54" dur="6.39">we can see that the move is to force the</text>
  <text start="456.75" dur="8.13">central banking establishment to do what</text>
  <text start="459.93" dur="7.83">they do best in a roaring economy to</text>
  <text start="464.88" dur="7.02">raise the interest rates to kick off a</text>
  <text start="467.76" dur="6.41">recession and there&amp;#39;s a interest rate</text>
  <text start="471.9" dur="4.17">meaning coming up in September and</text>
  <text start="474.17" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s about a 90 percent</text>
  <text start="476.07" dur="4.56">chance that they&amp;#39;ll raise the rates then</text>
  <text start="478.01" dur="5.65">December there&amp;#39;s another interest rates</text>
  <text start="480.63" dur="5.82">meeting and we know if they hit close to</text>
  <text start="483.66" dur="6.69">3% the whole system starts to come down</text>
  <text start="486.45" dur="7.59">and we&amp;#39;re getting very very close to</text>
  <text start="490.35" dur="6.38">that area now remember it&amp;#39;s not just the</text>
  <text start="494.04" dur="4.32">economy it&amp;#39;s everything that we are</text>
  <text start="496.73" dur="4.33">experiencing right now</text>
  <text start="498.36" dur="6.48">because when everything comes out into</text>
  <text start="501.06" dur="7.41">the open that we&amp;#39;re in this illusionary</text>
  <text start="504.84" dur="5.88">economy the central banks they drove it</text>
  <text start="508.47" dur="4.11">into the ground they did things behind</text>
  <text start="510.72" dur="4.47">closed doors because it&amp;#39;s a private</text>
  <text start="512.58" dur="6.33">corporation we don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="515.19" dur="7.71">doing and we also bring in then the deep</text>
  <text start="518.91" dur="6.3">state well the people around the world</text>
  <text start="522.9" dur="4.74">are gonna be looking at this saying what</text>
  <text start="525.21" dur="7.5">is going on here now once this</text>
  <text start="527.64" dur="6.6">information comes out do you think other</text>
  <text start="532.71" dur="4.5">countries the people around the world</text>
  <text start="534.24" dur="6.39">are going to have faith in the United</text>
  <text start="537.21" dur="7.02">States in the Federal Reserve in the</text>
  <text start="540.63" dur="7.23">central banking system if they lose</text>
  <text start="544.23" dur="6.99">faith what happens to the dollar what</text>
  <text start="547.86" dur="8.64">happens to their system it completely</text>
  <text start="551.22" dur="8.58">implode we&amp;#39;re reaching a pivotal time in</text>
  <text start="556.5" dur="6.03">history and it&amp;#39;s getting closer and</text>
  <text start="559.8" dur="5.1">closer and we&amp;#39;re gonna be discussing</text>
  <text start="562.53" dur="4.53">what this is all about in the next</text>
  <text start="564.9" dur="5.19">report because both of these are</text>
  <text start="567.06" dur="4.35">combined the economy with the central</text>
  <text start="570.09" dur="4.2">banks because remember the central banks</text>
  <text start="571.41" dur="5.76">they created free money which funded the</text>
  <text start="574.29" dur="5.34">deep state system and the central banks</text>
  <text start="577.17" dur="6.09">they&amp;#39;re behind a lot of this and they</text>
  <text start="579.63" dur="6.84">like control and offshoots from this</text>
  <text start="583.26" dur="3.96">came corruption came the deep state came</text>
  <text start="586.47" dur="3.719">every</text>
  <text start="587.22" dur="5.429">else that you know of to keep the system</text>
  <text start="590.189" dur="4.77">alive and then eventually go to war and</text>
  <text start="592.649" dur="5.911">then eventually restart the system this</text>
  <text start="594.959" dur="7.591">is exactly what they wanted but they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="598.56" dur="5.94">run into a roadblock they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="602.55" dur="5.789">people in place to pull this off right</text>
  <text start="604.5" dur="5.939">now they&amp;#39;re kind of stuck and this is</text>
  <text start="608.339" dur="4.411">why they&amp;#39;re going to try to point the</text>
  <text start="610.439" dur="6.21">finger but it looks like this might not</text>
  <text start="612.75" dur="6.12">work it looks like the Patriots and all</text>
  <text start="616.649" dur="4.351">those others around the world with Xi</text>
  <text start="618.87" dur="4.969">Jinping and Putin they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="621" dur="6.389">together they&amp;#39;re going to bring down the</text>
  <text start="623.839" dur="7.211">private western central banking system</text>
  <text start="627.389" dur="6.151">and the system will be restarted will we</text>
  <text start="631.05" dur="5.24">will be going through a transition it</text>
  <text start="633.54" dur="5.7">will be difficult in the beginning and</text>
  <text start="636.29" dur="5.859">we can see that we are headed in this</text>
  <text start="639.24" dur="6.3">direction so if you haven&amp;#39;t started to</text>
  <text start="642.149" dur="5.43">prepare I would start preparing if you</text>
  <text start="645.54" dur="3.18">have been preparing you&amp;#39;re thinking it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="647.579" dur="3.481">like no big deal</text>
  <text start="648.72" dur="5.64">the economy is great I would continue to</text>
  <text start="651.06" dur="5.149">prepare because normally what happens is</text>
  <text start="654.36" dur="4.8">when you think everything is fantastic</text>
  <text start="656.209" dur="6.281">that&amp;#39;s actually when it hits you know</text>
  <text start="659.16" dur="6.57">the calm before the storm when the skies</text>
  <text start="662.49" dur="5.279">look blue everything looks great but a</text>
  <text start="665.73" dur="4.589">hundred miles off the coast you don&amp;#39;t</text>
