  <text start="43.95" dur="6.99">bankers one full subprime let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="47.879" dur="5.521">the economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="50.94" dur="4.53">today we saw the Fed come out and gave</text>
  <text start="53.4" dur="4.53">their little speech about interest rates</text>
  <text start="55.47" dur="5.63">and it really did not help the stock</text>
  <text start="57.93" dur="6.72">market whatsoever gold is approaching</text>
  <text start="61.1" dur="5.44">1300 at this point i would suspect in</text>
  <text start="64.65" dur="6.899">the next couple of days we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="66.54" dur="6.75">see a suppression of gold and silver i</text>
  <text start="71.549" dur="3.93">wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="73.29" dur="4.67">thousands upon thousands of contracts</text>
  <text start="75.479" dur="4.591">that are thrown at this to bring it down</text>
  <text start="77.96" dur="4.96">but we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see because</text>
  <text start="80.07" dur="4.53">we&amp;#39;ve seen this pattern before but when</text>
  <text start="82.92" dur="4.05">we look at the economy we see things are</text>
  <text start="84.6" dur="5.25">rapidly falling apart we know more and</text>
  <text start="86.97" dur="4.98">more layoffs are coming and we see the</text>
  <text start="89.85" dur="5.78">bank of america right now they are</text>
  <text start="91.95" dur="6.12">getting ready to let go 8,000 employees</text>
  <text start="95.63" dur="5.5">now of course they&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="98.07" dur="5.399">online banking more people are switching</text>
  <text start="101.13" dur="4.529">over to this we don&amp;#39;t need the back</text>
  <text start="103.469" dur="4.801">office staff this is why we&amp;#39;re reducing</text>
  <text start="105.659" dur="4.56">it but we&amp;#39;re going to see many of these</text>
  <text start="108.27" dur="3.839">financial institutions start to lay off</text>
  <text start="110.219" dur="4.44">thousands upon thousands of people</text>
  <text start="112.109" dur="4.891">because what&amp;#39;s happening here in the</text>
  <text start="114.659" dur="5.611">economy is that most of the corporations</text>
  <text start="117" dur="5.579">they&amp;#39;re not turning a profit they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="120.27" dur="6.33">struggling right now they need to cut</text>
  <text start="122.579" dur="6.271">costs and we saw this back in 2008 prior</text>
  <text start="126.6" dur="3.57">to this where a lot of companies sorted</text>
  <text start="128.85" dur="3.84">lay off people and when the market came</text>
  <text start="130.17" dur="4.26">down all companies just went all out and</text>
  <text start="132.69" dur="3.42">said okay we&amp;#39;re getting rid of all these</text>
  <text start="134.43" dur="4.5">people and this is why unemployment shot</text>
  <text start="136.11" dur="4.98">up now according to John Williams right</text>
  <text start="138.93" dur="3.6">now we&amp;#39;re at twenty-three percent</text>
  <text start="141.09" dur="3.84">unemployment think about this for a</text>
  <text start="142.53" dur="8.25">second if we&amp;#39;re at twenty-three percent</text>
  <text start="144.93" dur="9.53">right now when this crisis hits where is</text>
  <text start="150.78" dur="8.34">unemployment going to go thirty percent</text>
  <text start="154.46" dur="8.57">no maybe forty fifty percent of the</text>
  <text start="159.12" dur="7.54">people not working this would be</text>
  <text start="163.03" dur="7.56">a complete disaster it would bring down</text>
  <text start="166.66" dur="7.08">the system and this is why we can see</text>
  <text start="170.59" dur="6.3">government&amp;#39;s preparing for what is about</text>
  <text start="173.74" dur="5.28">to happen here because the economy it is</text>
  <text start="176.89" dur="4.38">not doing well now the US government</text>
  <text start="179.02" dur="3.719">central bankers they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="181.27" dur="3.54">continually tell everyone that</text>
  <text start="182.739" dur="4.681">everything is fine that the economy is</text>
  <text start="184.81" dur="5.52">doing well they&amp;#39;re raising the minimum</text>
  <text start="187.42" dur="5.069">wage to make everyone feel good and we</text>
  <text start="190.33" dur="4.97">know what happens when they raise the</text>
  <text start="192.489" dur="5.851">minimum wage a lot of these</text>
  <text start="195.3" dur="5.2">establishments like McDonald&amp;#39;s and other</text>
  <text start="198.34" dur="4.14">places they go to automation they say</text>
  <text start="200.5" dur="4.23">okay you know what let the customer</text>
  <text start="202.48" dur="4.83">check out themselves we don&amp;#39;t need these</text>
  <text start="204.73" dur="5.1">people i&amp;#39;m not paying this amount i can</text>
  <text start="207.31" dur="4.17">replace all the employees with three</text>
  <text start="209.83" dur="5.129">machines and this is what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="211.48" dur="7.68">seeing happen now the US Department of</text>
  <text start="214.959" dur="8.011">Labor acting on a directive from the</text>
  <text start="219.16" dur="6.329">president which he issued back in March</text>
  <text start="222.97" dur="6.15">of 2014 has announced changes in the</text>
  <text start="225.489" dur="6.691">Fair Labor Standards and this is the</text>
  <text start="229.12" dur="7.83">Fair Labor Standards Act beginning this</text>
  <text start="232.18" dur="7.44">fall the Act will basically double the</text>
  <text start="236.95" dur="4.47">amount of money workers must make to be</text>
  <text start="239.62" dur="4.38">exempt from federal overtime pay</text>
  <text start="241.42" dur="5.819">requirements and what this means is is</text>
  <text start="244" dur="5.97">that employees with gross salaries under</text>
  <text start="247.239" dur="6.421">forty five thousand dollars who work</text>
  <text start="249.97" dur="8.43">more than 40 hours a week must be paid</text>
  <text start="253.66" dur="6.569">overtime because Obama he wasn&amp;#39;t able to</text>
  <text start="258.4" dur="4.26">increase the minimum wage through</text>
  <text start="260.229" dur="6.06">Congress so he kind of took the backdoor</text>
  <text start="262.66" dur="6">approach now what will this do well most</text>
  <text start="266.289" dur="5.451">likely we&amp;#39;re going to see a lot of</text>
  <text start="268.66" dur="8.12">people&amp;#39;s hours they&amp;#39;re going to be cut</text>
  <text start="271.74" dur="7.27">this will probably be a job killer and</text>
  <text start="276.78" dur="3.52">we really need to think about this for a</text>
  <text start="279.01" dur="5.39">second someone who&amp;#39;s making fifteen</text>
  <text start="280.3" dur="7.679">dollars an hour for a 40-hour job week</text>
  <text start="284.4" dur="7.41">comes in at 30 1,200 annually by raising</text>
  <text start="287.979" dur="8.861">the threshold Obama has more than likely</text>
  <text start="291.81" dur="10.06">creating an incentive not to hire</text>
  <text start="296.84" dur="9.03">full time workers just like Obamacare</text>
  <text start="301.87" dur="5.41">where people were out there and he said</text>
  <text start="305.87" dur="3.269">okay this is the number of hours you</text>
  <text start="307.28" dur="4.23">have to provide them health insurance</text>
  <text start="309.139" dur="4.321">and what did the employers do they did</text>
  <text start="311.51" dur="3.39">the opposite they cut hours they said</text>
  <text start="313.46" dur="5.01">okay then we won&amp;#39;t have anyone going</text>
  <text start="314.9" dur="6.57">over these hours no big deal and jobs</text>
  <text start="318.47" dur="6.38">were lost now when we look at the</text>
  <text start="321.47" dur="6.11">economy right now the economy is</text>
  <text start="324.85" dur="7.96">continually and rapidly falling apart</text>
  <text start="327.58" dur="6.55">we&amp;#39;re seeing that the core ppi rose by</text>
  <text start="332.81" dur="3.96">one-point-two percent higher than</text>
  <text start="334.13" dur="6.96">expected and of course this is because</text>
  <text start="336.77" dur="7.74">of energy prices going up and we can see</text>
  <text start="341.09" dur="6.63">that we&amp;#39;re at the final stage of this</text>
  <text start="344.51" dur="6.6">entire economic collapse because the</text>
  <text start="347.72" dur="9.06">subprime mortgage it is back and we are</text>
  <text start="351.11" dur="9.27">repeating 2008 all over again Wells</text>
  <text start="356.78" dur="5.31">Fargo Bank of America and many others</text>
  <text start="360.38" dur="4.82">they announced that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="362.09" dur="4.949">start issuing subprime loans once again</text>
  <text start="365.2" dur="4.54">now of course what they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="367.039" dur="9.481">offering is a three percent down loan</text>
  <text start="369.74" dur="9.5">sometimes it&amp;#39;s even 0% down and those</text>
  <text start="376.52" dur="5.31">people who have very low credit scores</text>
  <text start="379.24" dur="7.63">they will be able to get these type of</text>
  <text start="381.83" dur="9.899">loans so if you have a very low credit</text>
  <text start="386.87" dur="9.12">score income is not that great you can</text>
  <text start="391.729" dur="5.671">go ahead and get this type of loan now</text>
  <text start="395.99" dur="4.26">we saw this back in two thousand eight</text>
  <text start="397.4" dur="5.46">and we know what happened as soon as</text>
  <text start="400.25" dur="6">things started to fall apart guess what</text>
  <text start="402.86" dur="6.41">all those homes were abandoned but</text>
  <text start="406.25" dur="6.72">something very interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="409.27" dur="5.05">that Wells Fargo Bank of America and all</text>
  <text start="412.97" dur="5.569">the other banks they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="414.32" dur="7.61">issuing the loans but Fannie Mae is</text>
  <text start="418.539" dur="7.211">going to be buying these subprime loans</text>
  <text start="421.93" dur="6.15">so the banks will make the profits on</text>
  <text start="425.75" dur="2.33">the loans</text>
  <text start="428.46" dur="7.769">they&amp;#39;ll service the loan but Fannie Mae</text>
  <text start="430.139" dur="13.231">will then buy them so the taxpayer once</text>
  <text start="436.229" dur="10.461">again will assume the risk so if this is</text>
  <text start="443.37" dur="5.97">not fascism I don&amp;#39;t know what else is</text>
  <text start="446.69" dur="7.03">companies make the prophets and the</text>
  <text start="449.34" dur="7.41">losses go to everyone else and this is</text>
  <text start="453.72" dur="6.66">exactly what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now the</text>
  <text start="456.75" dur="6.509">last time the US government did this</text>
  <text start="460.38" dur="5.21">type of thing the debt level was 9</text>
  <text start="463.259" dur="5.071">trillion and it didn&amp;#39;t end well</text>
  <text start="465.59" dur="4.68">everything fell apart today the debt</text>
  <text start="468.33" dur="7.14">level is nineteen point two trillion and</text>
  <text start="470.27" dur="6.399">continually moving up in 2008 the</text>
  <text start="475.47" dur="4.199">Federal Reserve actually had the</text>
  <text start="476.669" dur="6.691">capacity to rapidly expand its balance</text>
  <text start="479.669" dur="5.601">sheet and / interest rates well interest</text>
  <text start="483.36" dur="4.529">rates are very close to zero right now</text>
  <text start="485.27" dur="7.329">do they have any room left on their</text>
  <text start="487.889" dur="6.601">balance sheet no yes can they add to it</text>
  <text start="492.599" dur="4.591">of course they can but we&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="494.49" dur="7.2">situation where there&amp;#39;s no place to go</text>
  <text start="497.19" dur="7.86">at this point it&amp;#39;s a dead end so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="501.69" dur="7.83">seeing the final stages to all of this</text>
  <text start="505.05" dur="8.369">right now and as we look at the economy</text>
  <text start="509.52" dur="6.24">it is getting worse and worse industrial</text>
  <text start="513.419" dur="5.941">production well that plunge for nine</text>
  <text start="515.76" dur="7.019">straight months in a row this is the</text>
  <text start="519.36" dur="7.02">longest non recession streak in 100</text>
  <text start="522.779" dur="7.771">years it is down by one point four</text>
  <text start="526.38" dur="8.88">percent and it&amp;#39;s not looking good here</text>
  <text start="530.55" dur="7.529">we are basically past the recession</text>
  <text start="535.26" dur="4.76">point already from all the economic</text>
  <text start="538.079" dur="5.611">indicators that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at a</text>
  <text start="540.02" dur="8.22">lot of them are a lot worse than two</text>
  <text start="543.69" dur="7.2">thousand eight and remember most of this</text>
  <text start="548.24" dur="4.45">economy that the central bankers the Fed</text>
  <text start="550.89" dur="2.939">they&amp;#39;re telling us how great it is i</text>
  <text start="552.69" dur="3.54">mean the united states government</text>
  <text start="553.829" dur="7.921">they&amp;#39;re telling us how great it is most</text>
  <text start="556.23" dur="8.07">of it was driven into this bubble effect</text>
  <text start="561.75" dur="5.49">by them the American people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="564.3" dur="5.28">sitting on the sidelines they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="567.24" dur="4.56">watching this saying who&amp;#39;s buying one of</text>
  <text start="569.58" dur="4.92">these houses no one&amp;#39;s buying or</text>
  <text start="571.8" dur="5.4">purchasing and read read in retail we</text>
  <text start="574.5" dur="4.94">approve of this nobody has jobs we</text>
  <text start="577.2" dur="6.15">approve of that too we looked at the</text>
  <text start="579.44" dur="6.4">personal federal tax receipts they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="583.35" dur="4.77">declining we looked at the state sales</text>
  <text start="585.84" dur="9.53">tax receipts we see people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="588.12" dur="10.8">spending and when this next crisis hits</text>
  <text start="595.37" dur="8.35">many countries they&amp;#39;re just going to</text>
  <text start="598.92" dur="8.46">fold because when we look at this we see</text>
  <text start="603.72" dur="7.83">that the financial system is in a</text>
  <text start="607.38" dur="8.33">gigantic bond bubble in 2008 when the</text>
  <text start="611.55" dur="8.73">crisis hit it was 80 trillion it is now</text>
  <text start="615.71" dur="6.58">100 trillion the derivatives market that</text>
  <text start="620.28" dur="4.59">uses this bond bubble as collateral is</text>
  <text start="622.29" dur="6.45">over five hundred and fifty five</text>
  <text start="624.87" dur="5.7">trillion in size many of the large</text>
  <text start="628.74" dur="4.73">multinational corporations sovereign</text>
  <text start="630.57" dur="5.79">governments and some municipal</text>
  <text start="633.47" dur="6.01">municipalities have used derivatives to</text>
  <text start="636.36" dur="5.729">fake earnings and high debt and we know</text>
  <text start="639.48" dur="5.43">already that twenty percent of corporate</text>
  <text start="642.089" dur="5.101">CFOs they&amp;#39;ve admitted to faking earnings</text>
  <text start="644.91" dur="5.9">in the past and you know this is much</text>
  <text start="647.19" dur="6.03">larger than what has been emitted to</text>
  <text start="650.81" dur="5.38">corporations today or more leverage than</text>
  <text start="653.22" dur="5.85">they were in 2007 Stanley drunken Miller</text>
  <text start="656.19" dur="5.37">has noted in 2007 corporate bonds were</text>
  <text start="659.07" dur="7.11">three point five trillion today they are</text>
  <text start="661.56" dur="9.81">seven trillion an amount equal to nearly</text>
  <text start="666.18" dur="9.15">fifty percent of u.s. gdp and then we</text>
  <text start="671.37" dur="9.03">look at the central banks well they are</text>
  <text start="675.33" dur="8.67">all leveraged either equal to or greater</text>
  <text start="680.4" dur="7.74">than Lehman Brothers when it completely</text>

  <text start="750.39" dur="2.55">are saying that the labor market is</text>
  <text start="751.59" dur="4.02">going to be strengthening don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="752.94" dur="5.85">about it but we&amp;#39;re not going to raise</text>
  <text start="755.61" dur="4.83">interest rates right now they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="758.79" dur="4.41">to raise interest rates may be later on</text>
