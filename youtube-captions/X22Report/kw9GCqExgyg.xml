  <text start="154.959" dur="9.061">to see the same signs and it looks very</text>
  <text start="158.61" dur="7.81">similar to 2007 going into 2008</text>
  <text start="164.02" dur="4.89">here in the United States they are</text>
  <text start="166.42" dur="5.85">continually pushing the illusion that</text>
  <text start="168.91" dur="6.27">everything is fine they&amp;#39;re telling us</text>
  <text start="172.27" dur="5.99">that the initial jobless claims they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="175.18" dur="7.41">very very low they only rose a thousand</text>
  <text start="178.26" dur="7.78">from 259 thousand to two hundred and</text>

  <text start="556.329" dur="5.25">will make prices rise there&amp;#39;s always a</text>
  <text start="559.779" dur="3.271">strategy and now we see the whole thing</text>
  <text start="561.579" dur="3.51">falling apart because the American</text>
  <text start="563.05" dur="2.37">people are sitting on the sidelines so</text>
  <text start="565.089" dur="4.951">what</text>
  <text start="565.42" dur="6.96">they create a mortgage program which</text>
  <text start="570.04" dur="4.71">allows you to come in with 3% down some</text>
  <text start="572.38" dur="5.19">banks 0% down they don&amp;#39;t even check</text>
  <text start="574.75" dur="5.37">credit they&amp;#39;ll just give you a home but</text>
  <text start="577.57" dur="6.3">again the American people they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="580.12" dur="8.49">out there the whole thing is a scam it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="583.87" dur="8.19">a Ponzi scam now we know the second</text>
  <text start="588.61" dur="5.01">quarter GDP they pump that up to three</text>
  <text start="592.06" dur="3.6">nine three point nine percent they took</text>
  <text start="593.62" dur="3.6">everything from the third quarter pumped</text>
  <text start="595.66" dur="4.08">it into the second quarter make look</text>
  <text start="597.22" dur="4.02">make it look really really good and now</text>
  <text start="599.74" dur="3.48">we get the information that the third</text>
  <text start="601.24" dur="7.29">quarter GDP is at one point four nine</text>
  <text start="603.22" dur="7.34">percent well why is this why all of a</text>
  <text start="608.53" dur="7.1">sudden did it completely fall apart</text>
  <text start="610.56" dur="8.47">well we have to remember the entire</text>
  <text start="615.63" dur="5.77">country is not manufacturing people</text>
  <text start="619.03" dur="4.97">aren&amp;#39;t spending remember a lot of the</text>
  <text start="621.4" dur="5.97">GDP is made up of consumer spending</text>
  <text start="624" dur="5.82">manufacturing so what kept it above the</text>
  <text start="627.37" dur="6.05">negative range that&amp;#39;s a big question</text>
  <text start="629.82" dur="7.72">well of course it was Obamacare</text>
  <text start="633.42" dur="7.8">Obamacare for the last couple of</text>
  <text start="637.54" dur="6.9">quarters which has now included in GDP</text>
  <text start="641.22" dur="7.12">which is very strange because taxes</text>
  <text start="644.44" dur="9.3">penalties are now included in the</text>
  <text start="648.34" dur="8.1">calculation of GDP so Obamacare was</text>
  <text start="653.74" dur="8.97">included and it was the biggest</text>
  <text start="656.44" dur="8.55">contributor to the GDP numbers it gave</text>
  <text start="662.71" dur="5.76">it a sixty point six billion annual eyes</text>
  <text start="664.99" dur="4.28">increase and where did this mutt where</text>
  <text start="668.47" dur="4.8">did this come from</text>
  <text start="669.27" dur="7.75">this came from the penalties and taxes</text>
  <text start="673.27" dur="5.46">included in Obamacare what we should do</text>
  <text start="677.02" dur="4.74">is just add all the taxes and penalties</text>
  <text start="678.73" dur="7.67">from everything and we can bring GDP up</text>
  <text start="681.76" dur="7.98">to what nine percent but this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="686.4" dur="7.15">helping the economy there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="689.74" dur="7.55">production there&amp;#39;s nothing of value from</text>
  <text start="693.55" dur="7.969">Obamacare this is being used</text>
  <text start="697.29" dur="8.4">to keep this economy in this ridiculous</text>
  <text start="701.519" dur="6.451">illusion that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;re doing now</text>
  <text start="705.69" dur="5.25">Goldman Sachs is out there and we know</text>
  <text start="707.97" dur="5.22">we cannot trust them whatsoever but</text>

  <text start="719.43" dur="3.389">it looks like this has run its course</text>
  <text start="721.139" dur="4.95">but they said something else which is</text>
  <text start="722.819" dur="5.181">very interesting and this is when you</text>
  <text start="726.089" dur="5.581">should really start to worry</text>
  <text start="728" dur="6.55">whenever a banker or the central bank</text>

  <text start="764.97" dur="5.88">that it&amp;#39;s contained</text>
  <text start="767.66" dur="5.65">we have 1.4 million manufacturing jobs</text>
  <text start="770.85" dur="7.289">that were lost and replaced by 1.5</text>
  <text start="773.31" dur="5.49">million part-time jobs so basically what</text>
  <text start="778.139" dur="3.901">they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="778.8" dur="5.219">just like the central bank back in 2008</text>
  <text start="782.04" dur="5.489">when they said the subprime was</text>
  <text start="784.019" dur="7.891">contained we&amp;#39;re heading for a huge</text>
  <text start="787.529" dur="12.331">disaster basically the six-year grand</text>

  <text start="799.86" dur="5.19">world has operated under a complete</text>
  <text start="802.43" dur="6.25">illusion that the central bank&amp;#39;s somehow</text>
  <text start="805.05" dur="5.43">fixed the 2008 crisis and why I say six</text>
  <text start="808.68" dur="6.69">years is I&amp;#39;m calculating it really from</text>
  <text start="810.48" dur="6.99">2009 now a fifth-grader</text>
  <text start="815.37" dur="4.649">would tell you that you cannot solve a</text>
  <text start="817.47" dur="5.28">debt problem by issuing more debt it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="820.019" dur="5.281">it&amp;#39;s completely impossible it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="822.75" dur="4.56">work and we have Greece to show that</text>
  <text start="825.3" dur="3.599">yeah it doesn&amp;#39;t work Cyprus to show yeah</text>
  <text start="827.31" dur="3.37">it doesn&amp;#39;t work and the rest of the</text>
  <text start="828.899" dur="4.211">countries in the European</text>
  <text start="830.68" dur="4.139">Union showing that whatever they were</text>
  <text start="833.11" dur="7.32">doing by adding more debt to these</text>
  <text start="834.819" dur="8.281">countries it just made it worse so we</text>
  <text start="840.43" dur="5.67">also see that from 2008 moving forward</text>
  <text start="843.1" dur="5.19">we added another 10 trillion in the debt</text>
  <text start="846.1" dur="4.589">to the u.s. system so this is not</text>
  <text start="848.29" dur="5.459">helping either so here are some of the</text>
  <text start="850.689" dur="6.301">facts the real problem for the financial</text>
  <text start="853.749" dur="6.59">system is the bond bubble in 2008 when</text>
  <text start="856.99" dur="7.5">the crisis hit it was 80 trillion now</text>
  <text start="860.339" dur="6.641">it&amp;#39;s a hundred trillion 20 trillion more</text>
  <text start="864.49" dur="4.98">the derivatives market that uses this</text>
  <text start="866.98" dur="5.479">bond bubble as collateral is over five</text>
  <text start="869.47" dur="5.029">hundred and fifty five trillion in size</text>
  <text start="872.459" dur="4.36">many of the large multinational</text>
  <text start="874.499" dur="5.111">corporations sovereign governments and</text>
  <text start="876.819" dur="7.471">unit municipalities have used</text>
  <text start="879.61" dur="8.25">derivatives to fake earnings and to hide</text>
  <text start="884.29" dur="5.94">debt no one knows to what degree this</text>
  <text start="887.86" dur="4.829">has been the case but given that 20</text>
  <text start="890.23" dur="4.56">percent of corporation corporate CFOs</text>
  <text start="892.689" dur="5.421">have admitted to faking earnings in the</text>
  <text start="894.79" dur="5.609">past it is likely it is a huge amount</text>
  <text start="898.11" dur="5.86">corporations today are more leverage</text>
  <text start="900.399" dur="7.23">than they were in 2007 the central banks</text>
  <text start="903.97" dur="8.58">now are leveraged at levels greater than</text>
  <text start="907.629" dur="7.291">or equal to where Lehman was the Fed</text>
  <text start="912.55" dur="5.37">right now is leveraged at seventy eight</text>
  <text start="914.92" dur="6.839">to one seventy eight to one the ECB is</text>
  <text start="917.92" dur="8.459">26 to one when Lehman imploded it was 30</text>
  <text start="921.759" dur="8.37">to one the central banks don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="926.379" dur="5.281">to exit from this strategy this plan</text>
  <text start="930.129" dur="7.2">they created they don&amp;#39;t know how to get</text>
  <text start="931.66" dur="9.719">out of it their balance sheet was 1.3</text>
  <text start="937.329" dur="9.331">trillion in 2009 it is over four point</text>
  <text start="941.379" dur="6.39">five trillion dollars we have a major</text>
  <text start="946.66" dur="4.769">problem</text>
  <text start="947.769" dur="7.531">in this country we are headed in a</text>
  <text start="951.429" dur="6.15">direction which is a full collapse of</text>
  <text start="955.3" dur="4.409">the system and everything that we look</text>
  <text start="957.579" dur="5.88">at we know the banks are completely</text>
  <text start="959.709" dur="4.62">insolvent we know we&amp;#39;ve been holding</text>
  <text start="963.459" dur="2.25">steady at zero</text>
  <text start="964.329" dur="3.81">percent interest rates I mean what are</text>
  <text start="965.709" dur="3.03">they do put it to negative this is not</text>
  <text start="968.139" dur="2.85">gonna help</text>
  <text start="968.739" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;ve been manipulating manipulating</text>
  <text start="970.989" dur="3.75">the unemployment numbers they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="972.519" dur="5.75">manipulating the GDP numbers they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="974.739" dur="6.421">been manipulating the inflation numbers</text>
  <text start="978.269" dur="6.25">they&amp;#39;re telling you that everything is</text>
  <text start="981.16" dur="5.219">fine and now we hear little voices out</text>
  <text start="984.519" dur="5.49">there saying oh we could be heading into</text>
  <text start="986.379" dur="6.21">some type of recession it looks like if</text>
  <text start="990.009" dur="5.161">we keep going in this direction it might</text>
  <text start="992.589" dur="3.96">be a slight recession which means that</text>
  <text start="995.17" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;re headed into a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="996.549" dur="5.63">and now Goldman of course came out and</text>
  <text start="998.92" dur="10.199">said they have manufacturing contained</text>
  <text start="1002.179" dur="9.07">this is a huge huge problem now the US</text>
  <text start="1009.119" dur="7.731">government as we know is passing a new</text>
  <text start="1011.249" dur="9.81">budget and hidden in the US budget is</text>
  <text start="1016.85" dur="8.949">something that everyone is not gonna</text>
  <text start="1021.059" dur="9.09">like and what the government is going to</text>
  <text start="1025.799" dur="9.23">do is they&amp;#39;re going to use robocall</text>
  <text start="1030.149" dur="8.581">debtors to find those people who owe</text>
  <text start="1035.029" dur="6.4">student loans taxes and mortgages so the</text>
  <text start="1038.73" dur="5.969">government right now as part of the</text>
  <text start="1041.429" dur="6.181">two-year budget bill section 301 would</text>
  <text start="1044.699" dur="5.431">amend section two to seven B of the 1935</text>
  <text start="1047.61" dur="4.77">Communications Act which prohibits</text>
  <text start="1050.13" dur="5.429">automated calls to any phone service for</text>

  <text start="1058.08" dur="7.86">solely to collect a debt owed to or</text>
  <text start="1061.639" dur="5.711">guaranteed by the United States the bill</text>
  <text start="1065.94" dur="4.05">gives the Federal Communication</text>
  <text start="1067.35" dur="4.59">Commission nine months to prescribe</text>
  <text start="1069.99" dur="5.7">regulations to implement the amendment</text>
  <text start="1071.94" dur="5.67">bot made by this section so what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1075.69" dur="4.68">going to do is you&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="1077.61" dur="6.199">receiving on your cell phone if you owe</text>
  <text start="1080.37" dur="5.939">taxes if you owe student loan if you owe</text>
  <text start="1083.809" dur="3.21">mortgage taxes or mortgages or anything</text>
  <text start="1086.309" dur="2.97">like that</text>
  <text start="1087.019" dur="5.471">most likely falling under Freddie and</text>
  <text start="1089.279" dur="5.941">Fannie they will be giving you a call</text>
  <text start="1092.49" dur="5.669">and it will be automated now the</text>
  <text start="1095.22" dur="5.86">question is why do they need this</text>
  <text start="1098.159" dur="4.781">well they need this because they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1101.08" dur="5.4">bringing in the revenue to the</text>
  <text start="1102.94" dur="7.369">government to pay for all this that even</text>
  <text start="1106.48" dur="8.179">with the interest rates at 0%</text>
  <text start="1110.309" dur="7.901">they tried faka they tried Obamacare and</text>
  <text start="1114.659" dur="6.281">they tried everything else to bring in</text>
  <text start="1118.21" dur="4.86">more revenue it has not worked but</text>
  <text start="1120.94" dur="3.78">people are tapped out and the reason why</text>
  <text start="1123.07" dur="3.57">people are not paying their taxes or</text>
  <text start="1124.72" dur="4.26">their student loans it&amp;#39;s because they</text>
  <text start="1126.64" dur="5.399">can&amp;#39;t find the jobs and they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1128.98" dur="5.549">the money I mean there are certain areas</text>
  <text start="1132.039" dur="4.651">of the tax code where people fall in</text>
  <text start="1134.529" dur="4.801">between things where if you&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="1136.69" dur="5.25">enough money to survive but not enough</text>
  <text start="1139.33" dur="5.67">money to take the taxes out to live and</text>
  <text start="1141.94" dur="5.7">support your family and these people end</text>
  <text start="1145" dur="5.94">up where they have a tax burden at the</text>
  <text start="1147.64" dur="5.55">end of the year because they&amp;#39;re right on</text>
  <text start="1150.94" dur="7.17">that borderline and this affects a lot</text>
  <text start="1153.19" dur="7.589">of people but they want their money</text>
  <text start="1158.11" dur="5.189">because they realize as this system</text>
  <text start="1160.779" dur="4.741">continually declines the revenues</text>
  <text start="1163.299" dur="4.5">getting harder and harder to find which</text>
  <text start="1165.52" dur="4.05">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense because you would</text>
  <text start="1167.799" dur="4.711">think with all the jobs and especially</text>
  <text start="1169.57" dur="5.489">the unemployment rate at close to 5% you</text>
  <text start="1172.51" dur="4.98">would think that everyone&amp;#39;s working and</text>
  <text start="1175.059" dur="7.531">everyone&amp;#39;s paying their taxes but as we</text>
  <text start="1177.49" dur="8.37">see these aren&amp;#39;t real full-time jobs the</text>
  <text start="1182.59" dur="7.26">unemployment number is not really around</text>
  <text start="1185.86" dur="5.22">5% it&amp;#39;s closer to 30% they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1189.85" dur="4.049">counting those people who are not</text>
  <text start="1191.08" dur="5.55">working and those people who are working</text>
  <text start="1193.899" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re just barely scraping by and</text>
  <text start="1196.63" dur="4.919">those kids that are coming out of</text>
  <text start="1198.669" dur="7.951">college they can&amp;#39;t find jobs to pay for</text>
  <text start="1201.549" dur="9.271">their student loans so it looks like</text>
  <text start="1206.62" dur="9.36">right now Ukraine is working with the</text>
  <text start="1210.82" dur="7.5">IMF and the IMF is going to change how</text>
  <text start="1215.98" dur="6.27">they do business they&amp;#39;re going to change</text>
  <text start="1218.32" dur="6.18">their lending rules why well we</text>
  <text start="1222.25" dur="6.299">understand in December Ukraine owes</text>
  <text start="1224.5" dur="7.46">Russia three billion dollars and under</text>
  <text start="1228.549" dur="7.171">the IMF what it means is</text>
  <text start="1231.96" dur="6.22">under their policy they forbid loaning</text>
  <text start="1235.72" dur="4.95">to any country that defaults on other</text>
  <text start="1238.18" dur="3.63">governments so Ukraine looks like</text>
  <text start="1240.67" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;re getting ready to default on</text>
  <text start="1241.81" dur="4.41">Russia they&amp;#39;re not gonna pay their three</text>
  <text start="1243.82" dur="4.41">billion dollars and the IMF is working</text>
  <text start="1246.22" dur="4.11">with Ukraine and they&amp;#39;re going to change</text>
  <text start="1248.23" dur="3.48">their policy where they can still loan</text>
  <text start="1250.33" dur="2.25">the money even if they default on</text>
  <text start="1251.71" dur="3.21">another government</text>
  <text start="1252.58" dur="5.54">how convenient hey they didn&amp;#39;t do that</text>
  <text start="1254.92" dur="7.17">for Greece did they no they did not</text>
  <text start="1258.12" dur="8.74">now China and Germany they are setting</text>
