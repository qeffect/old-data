  <text start="104.33" dur="8.16">state they used to be hunting Trump they</text>

  <text start="131.93" dur="8.16">doing they are hunting these individuals</text>
  <text start="135.98" dur="7.34">one by one think about what meadows and</text>
  <text start="140.09" dur="6.35">Nunez have done they have referred</text>
  <text start="143.32" dur="6.57">individuals to the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="146.44" dur="6.01">bar we&amp;#39;ll be taking a look at this</text>
  <text start="149.89" dur="6.22">behind the scenes there have been no</text>
  <text start="152.45" dur="6.899">leaks Huber and Horowitz they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="156.11" dur="4.36">investigating quite a bit they&amp;#39;re on the</text>
  <text start="159.349" dur="5.681">hunt</text>
  <text start="160.47" dur="8.1">these individuals are a little worried</text>
  <text start="165.03" dur="6.81">at this point everything that they set</text>
  <text start="168.57" dur="6.99">up has been stripped away they have</text>
  <text start="171.84" dur="7.08">nothing to protect them anymore and this</text>
  <text start="175.56" dur="5.34">is their biggest worry but first I</text>
  <text start="178.92" dur="4.41">wanted to start off with what is</text>
  <text start="180.9" dur="3.54">happening with Julian Assange we know</text>
  <text start="183.33" dur="4.32">that there were reports out there</text>
  <text start="184.44" dur="5.52">telling us that Assange is going to be</text>
  <text start="187.65" dur="5.76">leaving the embassy he&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="189.96" dur="5.85">arrested and this was put out there dan</text>
  <text start="193.41" dur="5.34">was gonna happen very very soon then we</text>
  <text start="195.81" dur="5.46">come to find out that the Ecuadorian</text>
  <text start="198.75" dur="4.98">government said no this is not true this</text>
  <text start="201.27" dur="3.66">is not going to happen and Assange is</text>
  <text start="203.73" dur="3.69">still in there</text>
  <text start="204.93" dur="4.59">well the gateway pun ensconce Andrew</text>
  <text start="207.42" dur="4.44">Fairbanks she&amp;#39;s in London covering</text>
  <text start="209.52" dur="5.58">events outside the Ecuadorian Embassy</text>
  <text start="211.86" dur="5.76">and a Monday night she spotted an</text>
  <text start="215.1" dur="5.76">undercover police vehicle staked outside</text>
  <text start="217.62" dur="6.33">of the embassy and she tweeted out the</text>
  <text start="220.86" dur="4.83">following I just confronted the</text>
  <text start="223.95" dur="4.5">undercover police here tonight for the</text>
  <text start="225.69" dur="6.39">third time how much is this covert</text>
  <text start="228.45" dur="6.78">operation costing taxpayers so it looks</text>
  <text start="232.08" dur="6.39">like there are individuals who are</text>
  <text start="235.23" dur="6.12">watching the embassy maybe to see if</text>
  <text start="238.47" dur="5.43">Julian Assange sneaks out and maybe they</text>
  <text start="241.35" dur="5.46">can pick them up but we can see that</text>
  <text start="243.9" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;ve been spying on the embassy this</text>
  <text start="246.81" dur="4.5">entire time and she confronts these</text>
  <text start="248.55" dur="4.89">individuals and they&amp;#39;re in the car and</text>
  <text start="251.31" dur="3.6">they hid their faces and we need to</text>
  <text start="253.44" dur="4.71">remember something very important</text>
  <text start="254.91" dur="5.88">q said to the clowns listen you might</text>
  <text start="258.15" dur="8.3">have the site but we have the source</text>
  <text start="260.79" dur="9.39">which means that the Patriots are</text>
  <text start="266.45" dur="6.52">protecting and helping Julian Assange</text>
  <text start="270.18" dur="4.83">and eventually he will leave the embassy</text>
  <text start="272.97" dur="5.04">I think it will be under the protection</text>
  <text start="275.01" dur="5.28">of the Patriots now what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="278.01" dur="5.96">interesting is that this is coming out</text>
  <text start="280.29" dur="8.629">of the American mirror and it turns out</text>
  <text start="283.97" dur="7.09">that commis daughter works for the SD NY</text>
  <text start="288.919" dur="5.051">this is the Southern District of New</text>
  <text start="291.06" dur="6.84">York she&amp;#39;s worked there since 25th</text>
  <text start="293.97" dur="7.02">Maureen Comey and she interned there and</text>
  <text start="297.9" dur="5.13">was a clerk in 2014 before being hired</text>
  <text start="300.99" dur="4.83">full time as a powerful lawyer for the</text>
  <text start="303.03" dur="6.86">prosecutor&amp;#39;s office now we know the SDN</text>
  <text start="305.82" dur="8.1">why they&amp;#39;re going after Trump and</text>
  <text start="309.89" dur="6.31">they&amp;#39;ve been investigating Trump and we</text>
  <text start="313.92" dur="5.46">know that they just introduced a bill in</text>
  <text start="316.2" dur="8.16">New York to see if they can get his tax</text>
  <text start="319.38" dur="7.32">records by changing the laws now we know</text>
  <text start="324.36" dur="5.37">that Trump fired James Comey back in May</text>
  <text start="326.7" dur="4.19">2017 and Trump has slammed James Comey</text>
  <text start="329.73" dur="5.61">several times in public</text>
  <text start="330.89" dur="6.73">has she recused herself from the cases</text>
  <text start="335.34" dur="6.84">involving the president that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="337.62" dur="7.77">question in a series of tweets Twitter</text>
  <text start="342.18" dur="5.52">user rosy memos shared screenshots</text>
  <text start="345.39" dur="5.76">showing that Comey certainly appears to</text>
  <text start="347.7" dur="7.11">work for Sdn why this is one of the</text>
  <text start="351.15" dur="5.64">tweets did we know commis daughter was</text>
  <text start="354.81" dur="5.64">an assistant US attorney for Sdn why</text>
  <text start="356.79" dur="5.129">since 2015 in another tweet rosie</text>
  <text start="360.45" dur="2.7">members shared a link to the open date</text>
  <text start="361.919" dur="3.451">in New York which is a database that</text>
  <text start="363.15" dur="6.09">allows users to search for information</text>
  <text start="365.37" dur="6.51">on businesses schools lawyers and so on</text>
  <text start="369.24" dur="5.07">in New York and according to this search</text>
  <text start="371.88" dur="4.59">on the website Maureen Ryan Comey is</text>
  <text start="374.31" dur="5.64">listed as working for the US Attorney&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="376.47" dur="7.92">Office so it looks like most likely this</text>
  <text start="379.95" dur="9.62">is true and we need to wonder what role</text>
  <text start="384.39" dur="9.92">is she playing in all of this now Comey</text>
  <text start="389.57" dur="8.41">he was out there and he condemned Trump</text>
  <text start="394.31" dur="5.92">for calling for a possible investigation</text>
  <text start="397.98" dur="5.73">into House Special Counsel Robert</text>
  <text start="400.23" dur="6.29">Muller&amp;#39;s Russia inquiry started adding</text>
  <text start="403.71" dur="6">that it creates a troubling precedent</text>
  <text start="406.52" dur="6.13">gee do you think commis a little worried</text>
  <text start="409.71" dur="6.33">he said I don&amp;#39;t fear it personally</text>
  <text start="412.65" dur="7.05">I fear it as a citizen right investigate</text>
  <text start="416.04" dur="5.97">what investigate that investigations</text>
  <text start="419.7" dur="4.95">were conducted what would be the crime</text>
  <text start="422.01" dur="5.21">you&amp;#39;d be investigating so it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="424.65" dur="5">terrible cycle to start</text>
  <text start="427.22" dur="5.13">take a listen to what he said what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="429.65" dur="5.76">saying to investigate perhaps you</text>
  <text start="432.35" dur="4.95">perhaps others do you fear that do you</text>
  <text start="435.41" dur="4.62">think that&amp;#39;s coming down the pike I</text>

  <text start="455.27" dur="4.74">people like me and so just be more of</text>
  <text start="457.94" dur="3.99">that dangerous step and I would hope</text>
  <text start="460.01" dur="4.02">although they continue to disappoint me</text>
  <text start="461.93" dur="3.57">the Republicans would finally stand up</text>
  <text start="464.03" dur="4.38">and say we don&amp;#39;t do that kind of thing</text>

  <text start="1351.599" dur="4.26">interesting is happening within as well</text>
  <text start="1352.859" dur="4.74">and I do believe that Trump the Patriots</text>
  <text start="1355.859" dur="3.99">are setting up the deep state and the</text>

  <text start="1378.75" dur="5.88">Institute at Houston Texas and Pence&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1381.6" dur="5.46">speech was highly rhetorical and he kept</text>
  <text start="1384.63" dur="4.23">repeating that Trump is unwavering in</text>
  <text start="1387.06" dur="4.14">his commitment to support the Venezuelan</text>
  <text start="1388.86" dur="4.38">opposition as it struggles to replace</text>
  <text start="1391.2" dur="4.89">the Maduro government of course Penn&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1393.24" dur="5.55">condemned Maduro and said you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1396.09" dur="4.59">against socialism Penn&amp;#39;s listed out the</text>
  <text start="1398.79" dur="3.69">sanctions and other measures that Trump</text>
  <text start="1400.68" dur="2.28">administration has employed to bring</text>
  <text start="1402.48" dur="3.45">down</text>
  <text start="1402.96" dur="5.88">Maduro now if you go back to North Korea</text>
  <text start="1405.93" dur="6.93">and you go back to Syria Trump had harsh</text>

  <text start="1416.52" dur="4.68">that this is exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1418.05" dur="4.98">usually it&amp;#39;s the opposite now the speech</text>
  <text start="1421.2" dur="4.23">was interesting for three reasons</text>
  <text start="1423.03" dur="5.67">once Penn&amp;#39;s didn&amp;#39;t mention a word about</text>
  <text start="1425.43" dur="7.89">Russia too he instead singled out Cuba</text>
  <text start="1428.7" dur="6.93">as the arch villain and the truth is the</text>
  <text start="1433.32" dur="4.68">only way Heat Maduro clings to power is</text>
  <text start="1435.63" dur="4.11">with the help that it receives from</text>
  <text start="1438" dur="5.07">communist Cuba</text>
  <text start="1439.74" dur="4.65">Cuba&amp;#39;s leaders are the real imperialist</text>
  <text start="1443.07" dur="3.99">in the Western Hemisphere</text>
  <text start="1444.39" dur="5.31">for decades Cuba has tried to create</text>
  <text start="1447.06" dur="5.04">client states across the region while</text>
  <text start="1449.7" dur="4.88">normal countries export goods Cuba</text>
  <text start="1452.1" dur="5.43">exports tyranny and strong-arm tactics</text>
  <text start="1454.58" dur="4.69">Cuba&amp;#39;s influence has driven Venezuela&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1457.53" dur="4.44">failure and at the time has come to</text>
  <text start="1459.27" dur="3.77">liberate Venezuela from Cuba and this is</text>
  <text start="1461.97" dur="5.28">very interesting because remember</text>
  <text start="1463.04" dur="6.88">trumped reversed the policies from Obama</text>
  <text start="1467.25" dur="7.05">that had to do with Cuba and if we go</text>
  <text start="1469.92" dur="7.98">back to post 1884 remember on August 15</text>
  <text start="1474.3" dur="5.97">2018 Q gave us a list of all these</text>
  <text start="1477.9" dur="6.66">different places where access was closed</text>
  <text start="1480.27" dur="7.14">well Cuba was on this list and it says</text>
  <text start="1484.56" dur="6.02">access closed which means the deep state</text>
  <text start="1487.41" dur="7.74">operated out of Cuba which says that</text>
  <text start="1490.58" dur="6.7">Cuba has something to do with Venezuela</text>
  <text start="1495.15" dur="4.159">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that this is</text>
  <text start="1497.28" dur="4.8">starting to make a lot more sense</text>
  <text start="1499.309" dur="6.25">remember the deep state there in many</text>
  <text start="1502.08" dur="6.63">countries the deep state has a hold on</text>
  <text start="1505.559" dur="5.461">certain governments and we can see in</text>
  <text start="1508.71" dur="6.48">Saudi Arabia in Haiti in North Korea</text>
  <text start="1511.02" dur="8.16">China Russia and Cuba access has been</text>
  <text start="1515.19" dur="6.33">closed and I do believe that their last</text>
  <text start="1519.18" dur="5.01">part of the mission here in Venezuela is</text>
  <text start="1521.52" dur="5.4">to force these individuals out of</text>
  <text start="1524.19" dur="4.35">Venezuela just like they did with North</text>
  <text start="1526.92" dur="3.81">Korea now as you can see with North</text>
  <text start="1528.54" dur="4.47">Korea those same individuals they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1530.73" dur="2.91">still pushing their agenda they&amp;#39;ll never</text>
  <text start="1533.01" dur="1.919">give up</text>
  <text start="1533.64" dur="3.93">and remember they use the mainstream</text>
  <text start="1534.929" dur="4.801">media to make it seem like something is</text>
  <text start="1537.57" dur="4.53">happening when it really isn&amp;#39;t like in</text>
  <text start="1539.73" dur="4.35">North Korea oh they&amp;#39;re starting to you</text>
  <text start="1542.1" dur="3.87">know develop their missile program again</text>
  <text start="1544.08" dur="3.54">they started their nuclear yet they go</text>
  <text start="1545.97" dur="4.14">all through this the same thing in</text>
  <text start="1547.62" dur="6.18">Venezuela and I believe there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="1550.11" dur="6">operation behind all of this which will</text>
  <text start="1553.8" dur="6.06">become very very clear very soon the</text>
  <text start="1556.11" dur="6.39">same thing with Iran now Pompeyo was out</text>
  <text start="1559.86" dur="5.76">there and he announced that the Iranian</text>
  <text start="1562.5" dur="8.19">Revolutionary Guard is now declared a</text>
  <text start="1565.62" dur="7.08">foreign terrorist organization and he</text>
  <text start="1570.69" dur="4.95">gave a speech and this is the part that</text>
  <text start="1572.7" dur="4.979">I find very interesting businesses and</text>
  <text start="1575.64" dur="4.38">banks around the world now have a clear</text>
  <text start="1577.679" dur="4.621">duty to ensure that companies with which</text>
  <text start="1580.02" dur="5.94">they conduct financial transactions are</text>
  <text start="1582.3" dur="5.55">not connected to the IRGC in any</text>
  <text start="1585.96" dur="3.54">material way it also gives the US</text>
  <text start="1587.85" dur="4.44">government additional tools to counter</text>
  <text start="1589.5" dur="5.25">Iranian backed terrorism now this is</text>
  <text start="1592.29" dur="3.99">coming out of the conservative tree</text>
  <text start="1594.75" dur="5.07">house and this really makes a lot of</text>
  <text start="1596.28" dur="6.12">sense the move to label members of the</text>
  <text start="1599.82" dur="5.31">Iranian Revolutionary Guard as official</text>
  <text start="1602.4" dur="4.83">terrorists designee x&amp;#39; now permits the</text>
  <text start="1605.13" dur="5.61">world financial community to impose</text>
  <text start="1607.23" dur="6.39">sanctions and freeze assets of any IRG</text>
  <text start="1610.74" dur="5.819">member and leaders of course it would</text>
  <text start="1613.62" dur="5.22">help the geopolitical effort if a US</text>
  <text start="1616.559" dur="5.961">official was say president of the World</text>
  <text start="1618.84" dur="6.75">Bank oh wait a minute David or Malpass</text>

  <text start="1628.08" dur="4">this helped</text>
  <text start="1629.31" dur="5.47">this now forces a situation where</text>
  <text start="1632.08" dur="5.58">financial proxies China Russia will have</text>
  <text start="1634.78" dur="5.28">to be created for an Iran to exploit</text>

  <text start="1642.34" dur="4.95">regime to escape sanctions and or frozen</text>
  <text start="1644.89" dur="4.89">assets will run the risk of being caught</text>
  <text start="1647.29" dur="5.97">by the US and subsequently suffer</text>
  <text start="1649.78" dur="5.82">financial consequences World Bank</text>
  <text start="1653.26" dur="5.7">president Daymond Malpass would hold the</text>
  <text start="1655.6" dur="6.06">key to any loans needed by ancillary</text>
  <text start="1658.96" dur="5.19">economies which means countries who rely</text>
  <text start="1661.66" dur="5.13">on the World Bank would be apprehensive</text>
  <text start="1664.15" dur="5.1">to engage in any financial connections</text>
  <text start="1666.79" dur="4.68">to Iran which means China Russia would</text>
  <text start="1669.25" dur="5.55">have to find a way to fill the financial</text>
  <text start="1671.47" dur="5.64">gap and any other country would have to</text>
