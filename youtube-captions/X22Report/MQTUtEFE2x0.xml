  <text start="194.62" dur="4.41">he&amp;#39;s absolutely right now here in the</text>
  <text start="197.71" dur="3.33">United States and not just the United</text>
  <text start="199.03" dur="5.97">States but around the world we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="201.04" dur="6.69">the entire Central Bank global economic</text>
  <text start="205" dur="6.3">system completely implode on itself and</text>
  <text start="207.73" dur="5.49">don&amp;#39;t get me wrong this system that</text>
  <text start="211.3" dur="4.74">we&amp;#39;re in today the central bank system</text>
  <text start="213.22" dur="5.04">will implode what people need to</text>
  <text start="216.04" dur="4.62">understand is that there are two things</text>
  <text start="218.26" dur="5.46">happening just like you didn&amp;#39;t see it</text>
  <text start="220.66" dur="5.4">happen in the 60s leading up to Nixon</text>
  <text start="223.72" dur="4.44">saying we&amp;#39;re off the gold standard most</text>
  <text start="226.06" dur="4.38">of the people are not seeing what Trump</text>
  <text start="228.16" dur="5.46">is doing right now leading up to the</text>
  <text start="230.44" dur="5.82">transition he is preparing the United</text>
  <text start="233.62" dur="4.83">States to transition out of this central</text>
  <text start="236.26" dur="4.64">bank system think about all the things</text>
  <text start="238.45" dur="6.18">that he has done with tax cuts</text>
  <text start="240.9" dur="6.58">deregulation removing the globalist</text>
  <text start="244.63" dur="5.61">trade deal saying that globalists do not</text>
  <text start="247.48" dur="5.4">have a future and the up-and-coming</text>
  <text start="250.24" dur="4.53">economy and when we look at the central</text>
  <text start="252.88" dur="3.21">bank system we can see that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="254.77" dur="3.99">completely imploding I mean if you look</text>
  <text start="256.09" dur="6">at retail housing and whatnot you can</text>
  <text start="258.76" dur="5.31">see that there are major major problems</text>
  <text start="262.09" dur="4.11">and Friday we talked about how the</text>
  <text start="264.07" dur="4.44">Millennials today they need to put</text>
  <text start="266.2" dur="4.26">whatever they&amp;#39;re purchasing on payment</text>
  <text start="268.51" dur="3.99">plans now do I need do I mean every</text>
  <text start="270.46" dur="5.91">single person no but the majority of the</text>
  <text start="272.5" dur="5.97">people they are struggling and this is</text>
  <text start="276.37" dur="4.41">what happens in a central bank system it</text>
  <text start="278.47" dur="5.01">completely breaks down and the dollar is</text>
  <text start="280.78" dur="4.62">worth nothing and that&amp;#39;s why over the</text>
  <text start="283.48" dur="3.84">period of time you&amp;#39;ve seen things</text>
  <text start="285.4" dur="3.6">changed like if you&amp;#39;re gonna buy a car</text>
  <text start="287.32" dur="3.87">or if you&amp;#39;re gonna go to college if</text>
  <text start="289" dur="3.72">you&amp;#39;re going to purchase a house even if</text>
  <text start="291.19" dur="3.84">you&amp;#39;re gonna buy the everyday item in</text>
  <text start="292.72" dur="5.22">this store you can see the everyday item</text>
  <text start="295.03" dur="4.8">in the store is now coming connected to</text>
  <text start="297.94" dur="3.45">payment plans and that is just</text>
  <text start="299.83" dur="3.21">absolutely ridiculous but it does make</text>
  <text start="301.39" dur="4.89">sense because when you look at the</text>
  <text start="303.04" dur="7.82">retail market you can see the mall</text>
  <text start="306.28" dur="8.91">vacancies they hit an eight-year high</text>
  <text start="310.86" dur="9.37">there&amp;#39;s a huge number of stores that are</text>
  <text start="315.19" dur="7.86">closing and just in the year 2019 we</text>
  <text start="320.23" dur="6.24">have seen a record 11 thousand plus</text>
  <text start="323.05" dur="5.82">store closures already exceeding the</text>
  <text start="326.47" dur="4.53">annual number of the past few years with</text>
  <text start="328.87" dur="6.66">coresight research projecting the figure</text>
  <text start="331" dur="8.19">to touch an all-time high of 12,000 by</text>
  <text start="335.53" dur="6.42">the end of 2019 think about that for a</text>
  <text start="339.19" dur="5.03">second think about how this entire</text>
  <text start="341.95" dur="5.13">central bank system is completely</text>
  <text start="344.22" dur="4.48">imploding on itself and remember Trump</text>
  <text start="347.08" dur="3.69">and the Patriots they&amp;#39;re not just</text>
  <text start="348.7" dur="5.13">sitting by saying ok let all this crash</text>
  <text start="350.77" dur="6.65">what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="353.83" dur="6.27">specific moves to build this new economy</text>
  <text start="357.42" dur="6.34">think about it the trade deals have been</text>
  <text start="360.1" dur="8.64">changed the globalists system completely</text>
  <text start="363.76" dur="9.18">pushed to the side destroyed no longer</text>
  <text start="368.74" dur="8.22">will we be in a globalist system Trump</text>
  <text start="372.94" dur="6.6">is deregulating he&amp;#39;s cutting taxes he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="376.96" dur="6.06">placed tariffs on China to push</text>
  <text start="379.54" dur="4.77">companies out of China maybe into other</text>
  <text start="383.02" dur="5.07">countries hopefully back to the United</text>
  <text start="384.31" dur="6.57">States but he needed to do this to even</text>
  <text start="388.09" dur="8.36">the playing field what else did he need</text>
  <text start="390.88" dur="8.28">to do he needed to pump up the minority</text>
  <text start="396.45" dur="6.13">employment numbers which means</text>
  <text start="399.16" dur="6.09">unemployment needs to fall and he has</text>
  <text start="402.58" dur="6.03">been doing this right now the u.s.</text>
  <text start="405.25" dur="6.6">gained a net 181 thousand jobs in the</text>
  <text start="408.61" dur="4.559">employment report minorities continue to</text>
  <text start="411.85" dur="4.2">benefit from the historically low</text>
  <text start="413.169" dur="5.581">unemployment the unemployment rate as we</text>
  <text start="416.05" dur="5.76">know has been below 4 percent for seven</text>
  <text start="418.75" dur="5.9">months in a row and it&amp;#39;s fallen to three</text>
  <text start="421.81" dur="4.71">point five percent this is a 50-year low</text>
  <text start="424.65" dur="4.12">african-american unemployment remained</text>
  <text start="426.52" dur="2.959">at a record low of 5.5 percent in</text>
  <text start="428.77" dur="3.03">September</text>
  <text start="429.479" dur="6.851">Hispanic unemployment fell to a</text>
  <text start="431.8" dur="7.23">record-low of 3.9% in September when</text>
  <text start="436.33" dur="6.35">Trump came into office that employment</text>
  <text start="439.03" dur="8.609">rate unemployment rate was around 4.5%</text>
  <text start="442.68" dur="8.019">why is Trump doing this well what he</text>
  <text start="447.639" dur="5.701">needs to do is he needs to bring the</text>
  <text start="450.699" dur="7.831">minorities into the picture get them</text>
  <text start="453.34" dur="10.139">jobs and build the lower middle class</text>
  <text start="458.53" dur="8.039">the middle class back up wages for the</text>
  <text start="463.479" dur="7.31">middle class Americans are rising twice</text>
  <text start="466.569" dur="7.111">as fast as wages for high-income earners</text>
  <text start="470.789" dur="7.571">what is Trump doing this is being done</text>
  <text start="473.68" dur="9.78">in the shadows in stealth he is closing</text>
  <text start="478.36" dur="8.58">the wealth gap this dynamic is directly</text>
  <text start="483.46" dur="6.419">attached to Trump&amp;#39;s transition economy</text>
  <text start="486.94" dur="5.42">policy that focuses wage and income</text>
  <text start="489.879" dur="4.621">benefit directly to mainstream</text>
  <text start="492.36" dur="4.869">production economy and reverses the</text>
  <text start="494.5" dur="4.86">process that was driving benefit to US</text>
  <text start="497.229" dur="4.921">multinationals on Wall Street the</text>
  <text start="499.36" dur="4.679">service driven economy wage growth is</text>
  <text start="502.15" dur="3.81">currently strongest for workers in</text>
  <text start="504.039" dur="3.69">low-wage industries such as clothing</text>
  <text start="505.96" dur="4.679">stores supermarkets amusement parks</text>
  <text start="507.729" dur="5.6">casinos and earnings are growing most</text>
  <text start="510.639" dur="5.551">slowly in high wage industries such as</text>
  <text start="513.329" dur="5.95">medical labs law firms broadcasting</text>
  <text start="516.19" dur="5.7">telecom companies the reasoning is quite</text>
  <text start="519.279" dur="4.471">simple there are many people attached to</text>
  <text start="521.89" dur="4.199">the Wall Street economy who ran up well</text>
  <text start="523.75" dur="5.67">via the process of deindustrialization</text>
  <text start="526.089" dur="4.921">of America anyone who gained income</text>
  <text start="529.42" dur="2.96">through the process of multinational</text>
  <text start="531.01" dur="4.47">export of investment of jobs</text>
  <text start="532.38" dur="5.05">specifically us-based multinationals are</text>
  <text start="535.48" dur="4.71">naturally going to see negative impact</text>
  <text start="537.43" dur="4.67">as the reverse takes place multinational</text>
  <text start="540.19" dur="4.47">investment asset held overseas are</text>
  <text start="542.1" dur="4.66">precariously position as the Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.66" dur="5.34">America first trade policy starts to get</text>
  <text start="546.76" dur="5.4">teeth any US corporation who attempts to</text>
  <text start="550" dur="5.04">fight against the tariff process will</text>
  <text start="552.16" dur="5.19">find themselves expending a large amount</text>
  <text start="555.04" dur="4.38">of money while simultaneously losing the</text>
  <text start="557.35" dur="4.32">price advantage and they will be</text>
  <text start="559.42" dur="4.95">simultaneously positioned to lose market</text>
  <text start="561.67" dur="3.099">share to us-based or North American</text>
  <text start="564.37" dur="2.319">based</text>
  <text start="564.769" dur="5.13">petition this is why the u.s. MCA</text>
  <text start="566.689" dur="6.721">becomes very very important once the</text>
  <text start="569.899" dur="5.461">u.s. MCA is ratified and you can tell</text>
  <text start="573.41" dur="2.339">they don&amp;#39;t even want to touch this right</text>
  <text start="575.36" dur="4.069">now</text>
  <text start="575.749" dur="6.51">it gives us multinationals a definitive</text>
  <text start="579.429" dur="5.5">long-term position from which they can</text>
  <text start="582.259" dur="4.11">calculate their costs and right now the</text>
  <text start="584.929" dur="4.38">multinationals they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="586.369" dur="5.7">prior agent investments viable however</text>
  <text start="589.309" dur="5.34">the clock is ticking those unknown</text>
  <text start="592.069" dur="6.75">variables have a cost and with the u.s.</text>
  <text start="594.649" dur="6.87">MCA passed guess what they can calculate</text>
  <text start="598.819" dur="4.92">those costs this is why Trump is pushing</text>
  <text start="601.519" dur="7.11">for this and if you notice what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="603.739" dur="8.58">doing he&amp;#39;s building the wages back up</text>
  <text start="608.629" dur="6.51">from the bottom and he&amp;#39;s closing the</text>
  <text start="612.319" dur="5.221">wealth gap this needs to be done think</text>
  <text start="615.139" dur="6.68">about all the things that need to be</text>
  <text start="617.54" dur="8.699">done so we can transition into a strong</text>
  <text start="621.819" dur="6.31">new sound money economic system this is</text>
  <text start="626.239" dur="4.56">why he&amp;#39;s building all of this this is</text>
  <text start="628.129" dur="6.63">why he&amp;#39;s pushing the central bank system</text>
  <text start="630.799" dur="7.98">to the very edge he needs the time to do</text>
  <text start="634.759" dur="6.81">this and guess what it is working and as</text>
  <text start="638.779" dur="6.331">you can see once the brexit goes through</text>
  <text start="641.569" dur="7.8">and Trump makes the trade deal with the</text>
  <text start="645.11" dur="5.729">UK boom we&amp;#39;re gonna see other countries</text>
  <text start="649.369" dur="5.25">say hey you know something</text>
  <text start="650.839" dur="6.29">maybe we should do the same the world is</text>
  <text start="654.619" dur="5.52">about to change</text>
  <text start="657.129" dur="6.611">Trump and many of the leaders are going</text>
  <text start="660.139" dur="6.87">to get on board and they&amp;#39;re all going to</text>
  <text start="663.74" dur="6.809">follow the same path and we can see</text>
  <text start="667.009" dur="6.69">already things are changing the</text>
  <text start="670.549" dur="7.71">transition is being prepped it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="673.699" dur="8.19">prepared and soon it will be ready and</text>
  <text start="678.259" dur="6.18">there will be an announcement just like</text>
  <text start="681.889" dur="3.78">there was an announcement in 71 but this</text>

  <text start="688.519" dur="4.711">very very different and most likely the</text>
