  <text start="48.05" dur="4.92">hi and welcome you listening to the x22</text>
  <text start="51.53" dur="4.919">report my name is Dave and this is</text>
  <text start="52.97" dur="6.54">episode 1231 a and today&amp;#39;s date is March</text>
  <text start="56.449" dur="5.461">17th 2017 and the thought of the episode</text>
  <text start="59.51" dur="4.619">is this economic indicator just</text>
  <text start="61.91" dur="5.94">confirmed we are in a recession and</text>
  <text start="64.129" dur="6.421">headed for a disaster let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="67.85" dur="4.83">economic collapse financial news now</text>
  <text start="70.55" dur="4.95">something strange happened with the</text>
  <text start="72.68" dur="4.56">humic consumer comp and we look at this</text>
  <text start="75.5" dur="4.89">to see you know what people are thinking</text>
  <text start="77.24" dur="6.48">we also look at the Gallup survey to see</text>
  <text start="80.39" dur="4.95">how people feel about the economy and</text>
  <text start="83.72" dur="4.64">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about it this</text>
  <text start="85.34" dur="4.32">time is that Republicans and Democrats</text>
  <text start="88.36" dur="4.06">well</text>
  <text start="89.66" dur="4.23">they look at it completely differently</text>
  <text start="92.42" dur="4.29">now they look at the economy completely</text>
  <text start="93.89" dur="6.03">differently now remember Obama handed</text>
  <text start="96.71" dur="5.04">off this strong economy to trump at</text>
  <text start="99.92" dur="3.57">least that&amp;#39;s what he said we know it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="101.75" dur="3.66">complete illusion we&amp;#39;ve been looking at</text>
  <text start="103.49" dur="4.019">all the economic indicators we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="105.41" dur="4.41">delving deep into the numbers and we can</text>
  <text start="107.509" dur="5.31">see that there&amp;#39;s no way that this is a</text>
  <text start="109.82" dur="5.88">strong economy especially when retail is</text>
  <text start="112.819" dur="5.431">contracting GDP is a complete illusion</text>
  <text start="115.7" dur="4.68">the unemployment numbers don&amp;#39;t even make</text>
  <text start="118.25" dur="6.09">sense the restaurant Performance Index</text>
  <text start="120.38" dur="6.239">is continually declining and we can see</text>
  <text start="124.34" dur="3.63">that the economy is a complete mess but</text>
  <text start="126.619" dur="3.541">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about all this</text>
  <text start="127.97" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s only been what since Trump came</text>
  <text start="130.16" dur="3.54">into office since it was January 20th</text>
  <text start="132.5" dur="4.2">and now here we are</text>
  <text start="133.7" dur="4.44">March 17th by the way happy st. Patty&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="136.7" dur="3.929">Day for those people who are celebrating</text>
  <text start="138.14" dur="5.55">st. Patty&amp;#39;s Day what we are seeing is</text>
  <text start="140.629" dur="6.511">that Democrats now they are saying they</text>
  <text start="143.69" dur="7.11">are expecting a recession now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="147.14" dur="6.39">just strange in itself because just a</text>
  <text start="150.8" dur="4.829">couple months ago what two and a half</text>
  <text start="153.53" dur="4.65">months ago this was the strongest</text>
  <text start="155.629" dur="4.741">economy ever now what has Trump done</text>
  <text start="158.18" dur="4.32">nothing he hasn&amp;#39;t really done anything</text>
  <text start="160.37" dur="4.32">to the economy I mean the stock market&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="162.5" dur="4.709">gone up but it wasn&amp;#39;t like oh we just</text>
  <text start="164.69" dur="6.36">had you know 22 manufacturing plants</text>
  <text start="167.209" dur="6.331">built we just hired 700,000 people that</text>
  <text start="171.05" dur="4.469">didn&amp;#39;t happen actually we&amp;#39;re still on</text>
  <text start="173.54" dur="3.87">course for the same exact thing that has</text>
  <text start="175.519" dur="4.741">happened since Obama was president a</text>
  <text start="177.41" dur="4.05">collapse of the system and now Democrats</text>
  <text start="180.26" dur="2.67">are saying there</text>
  <text start="181.46" dur="4.19">affecting a recession now on the flip</text>
  <text start="182.93" dur="6.2">side the Republicans are saying we see</text>
  <text start="185.65" dur="6.76">incredible growth in ahead of us really</text>
  <text start="189.13" dur="3.7">incredible growth how possibly can this</text>
  <text start="192.41" dur="2.46">be</text>
  <text start="192.83" dur="4.05">now what&amp;#39;s eat what gets even stranger</text>
  <text start="194.87" dur="5.25">than that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about the</text>
  <text start="196.88" dur="5.34">Atlanta Fed and how they look at GDP and</text>
  <text start="200.12" dur="4.71">they make a forecast and they started</text>
  <text start="202.22" dur="3.27">out around 3% or so and they kept on</text>
  <text start="204.83" dur="5.1">dropping it</text>
  <text start="205.49" dur="7.41">you know 1.9 1.7 1.2 they&amp;#39;re down 2.9</text>
  <text start="209.93" dur="5.37">percent now didn&amp;#39;t the the New York Fed</text>
  <text start="212.9" dur="5.31">well they have their own four castings</text>
  <text start="215.3" dur="4.68">and they are showing a robust 3.2</text>
  <text start="218.21" dur="5.34">percent now these are completely</text>
  <text start="219.98" dur="6.95">opposite 0.9% and all of a sudden went</text>
  <text start="223.55" dur="5.13">3.2 percent how possibly can this be</text>
  <text start="226.93" dur="3.37">something&amp;#39;s not right</text>
  <text start="228.68" dur="4.67">so this is very interesting going</text>
  <text start="230.3" dur="5.58">forward right now because we have two</text>
  <text start="233.35" dur="5.71">forecasts that are completely different</text>
  <text start="235.88" dur="5.43">now if we look past all of this well we</text>
  <text start="239.06" dur="5.07">see many interesting and different</text>
  <text start="241.31" dur="5.46">things because if retail is contracting</text>
  <text start="244.13" dur="5.13">and more and more stores are closing and</text>
  <text start="246.77" dur="6.27">more individuals are being laid off and</text>
  <text start="249.26" dur="6.27">car sales are slowing and delinquencies</text>
  <text start="253.04" dur="5.759">are on the rise and construction is</text>
  <text start="255.53" dur="5.67">slowing where is manufacturing producing</text>
  <text start="258.799" dur="7.111">does it make sense something is not</text>
  <text start="261.2" dur="7.77">right and how do we go from a 1.6</text>
  <text start="265.91" dur="5.16">percent GDP all the way up to a 3.2</text>
  <text start="268.97" dur="5.21">percent unless you&amp;#39;re manipulating</text>
  <text start="271.07" dur="5.64">because in two and a half months again</text>
  <text start="274.18" dur="4.42">something doesn&amp;#39;t make sense now of</text>
  <text start="276.71" dur="4.34">course we&amp;#39;ve seen manipulation before</text>
  <text start="278.6" dur="6.09">with the GDP your numbers are revised</text>
  <text start="281.05" dur="6.31">just right before the elections we had</text>
  <text start="284.69" dur="4.62">this export of soybeans which pushed it</text>
  <text start="287.36" dur="3.9">up to two percent or so then they</text>
  <text start="289.31" dur="3.78">revised it a little bit more massage it</text>
  <text start="291.26" dur="4.17">a little bit more made it three percent</text>
  <text start="293.09" dur="4.5">but though it&amp;#39;s manipulated and when we</text>
  <text start="295.43" dur="5.19">look at the Atlanta Fed they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="297.59" dur="6.54">right on target I would say 99 percent</text>
  <text start="300.62" dur="6.56">of the time and something else happened</text>
  <text start="304.13" dur="8.61">that was very interesting today a seller</text>
  <text start="307.18" dur="8.289">dumped 9.2 four million Apple shares in</text>
  <text start="312.74" dur="5.729">a single block trade</text>
  <text start="315.469" dur="5.94">the Nasdaq open mounting to just over</text>
  <text start="318.469" dur="5.4">1.3 billion worth of Apple stock now why</text>
  <text start="321.409" dur="5.19">did they do this do they know something</text>
  <text start="323.869" dur="4.2">that we don&amp;#39;t because we see a lot of</text>
  <text start="326.599" dur="5.07">these things where all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="328.069" dur="6.87">people dump a lot of stock or silver is</text>
  <text start="331.669" dur="5.01">smashed down by a lot of paper contracts</text>
  <text start="334.939" dur="3.54">gold is smashed down with a lot of paper</text>
  <text start="336.679" dur="5.1">contracts and we&amp;#39;re starting to see a</text>
  <text start="338.479" dur="6.51">lot of strange things happen during this</text>
  <text start="341.779" dur="5.521">period of time and we&amp;#39;ve seen all the</text>
  <text start="344.989" dur="4.74">soft data that&amp;#39;s been saying that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="347.3" dur="4.649">were in this Trump euphoria this Trump</text>
  <text start="349.729" dur="5.01">bump well that&amp;#39;s all disappearing right</text>
  <text start="351.949" dur="4.74">now and we see the hard data is showing</text>
  <text start="354.739" dur="5.01">that things are rapidly deteriorating</text>
  <text start="356.689" dur="5.4">now we had a brief jump in December for</text>
  <text start="359.749" dur="4.23">a US industrial production and we can</text>
  <text start="362.089" dur="3.81">see at this point it was unchanged but</text>
  <text start="363.979" dur="4.77">what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="365.899" dur="6.51">that industrial production has been</text>
  <text start="368.749" dur="6.69">declining since the beginning of 2015</text>
  <text start="372.409" dur="5.97">and when we see something like this it</text>
  <text start="375.439" dur="5.1">tells us there&amp;#39;s something wrong so the</text>
  <text start="378.379" dur="4.41">Fed just raised the rates into a weak</text>
  <text start="380.539" dur="5.25">economy and then when we look at the</text>
  <text start="382.789" dur="5.19">industrial production chart well and we</text>
  <text start="385.789" dur="4.38">look at the hard data we see that</text>
  <text start="387.979" dur="5.34">something has gone terribly wrong</text>
  <text start="390.169" dur="6.78">because industrial production has never</text>
  <text start="393.319" dur="6.39">declined on a 24-month basis without the</text>
  <text start="396.949" dur="5.22">US economy being in a recession and if</text>
  <text start="399.709" dur="5.52">we go back in time and we look at this</text>
  <text start="402.169" dur="4.92">one particular chart we don&amp;#39;t we looked</text>
  <text start="405.229" dur="2.61">at many other indicators showing that</text>
  <text start="407.089" dur="3.03">we&amp;#39;re in a recession</text>
  <text start="407.839" dur="4.97">but when we look at this chart it</text>
  <text start="410.119" dur="5.67">matches up perfectly if we go back to</text>
  <text start="412.809" dur="6.22">2007-2008 industrial production dropped</text>
  <text start="415.789" dur="5.73">same thing when we go back to 2001 when</text>
  <text start="419.029" dur="5.88">we go through out back in time we see it</text>
  <text start="421.519" dur="5.72">at each and every point and here we are</text>
  <text start="424.909" dur="4.41">where industrial production is</text>
  <text start="427.239" dur="6.1">continually declining and now it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="429.319" dur="7.53">24 months and that tells us that we are</text>
  <text start="433.339" dur="5.82">in a recession right now and the central</text>
  <text start="436.849" dur="4.11">bank knows this they know exactly what</text>
  <text start="439.159" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re doing they know they&amp;#39;ve just</text>
  <text start="440.959" dur="4.591">raised the rates into a very weak</text>
  <text start="442.849" dur="5.761">economy now the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="445.55" dur="3.81">bank well they&amp;#39;re getting ready to pin</text>
  <text start="448.61" dur="3.989">the coming</text>
  <text start="449.36" dur="6.149">stock market collapse on Trump he is the</text>
  <text start="452.599" dur="4.921">fall guy so when people think greater</text>
  <text start="455.509" dur="3.96">depression they&amp;#39;re gonna say greater</text>
  <text start="457.52" dur="3.989">depression equals Trump this is what</text>
  <text start="459.469" dur="3.66">they want in the end right now the</text>
  <text start="461.509" dur="4.231">Federal Reserve is the deep state&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="463.129" dur="5.22">weapon of choice the economy has been on</text>
  <text start="465.74" dur="4.5">life support since 2008 we know this</text>
  <text start="468.349" dur="3.451">this is why we&amp;#39;ve been tracking it so</text>
  <text start="470.24" dur="4.139">there&amp;#39;s no surprises we know exactly</text>
  <text start="471.8" dur="5.85">what&amp;#39;s going on the Fed has pumped it up</text>
  <text start="474.379" dur="5.521">with a huge amount of stimulus this has</text>
  <text start="477.65" dur="4.59">created enormous distortions and miss</text>
  <text start="479.9" dur="4.56">allocations of capital that need to be</text>
  <text start="482.24" dur="4.37">flushed trillions of dollars in money</text>
  <text start="484.46" dur="5.78">printing have been continuing</text>
  <text start="486.61" dur="6.91">quantitative easing 1-2-3 has been used</text>
  <text start="490.24" dur="4.959">meanwhile we have zero or even negative</text>
  <text start="493.52" dur="3.69">interest rates in many countries rates</text>
  <text start="495.199" dur="3.601">are the lowest they&amp;#39;ve been in 5,000</text>
  <text start="497.21" dur="3.69">years of recorded human history</text>
  <text start="498.8" dur="5.579">if the deep state wants to trigger a</text>
  <text start="500.9" dur="5.85">stock market collapse on par with 1929</text>
  <text start="504.379" dur="4.921">it just has to pull the plug and just</text>
  <text start="506.75" dur="3.93">say we&amp;#39;re done here but they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="509.3" dur="3.659">to do this because it will look like</text>
  <text start="510.68" dur="4.289">they actually did it and people will</text>
  <text start="512.959" dur="5.01">blame them and this is why they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="514.969" dur="4.591">done it as of yet but the outcome of</text>
  <text start="517.969" dur="3.45">where we&amp;#39;re headed and what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="519.56" dur="4.44">happen it&amp;#39;s already baked in the cake</text>
  <text start="521.419" dur="5.16">it&amp;#39;s just a matter of when and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="524" dur="4.74">good chance when is coming up pretty</text>
  <text start="526.579" dur="5.221">darn soon so let&amp;#39;s go back a little bit</text>
  <text start="528.74" dur="4.62">here in December of 2015 the Fed raised</text>
  <text start="531.8" dur="3.81">interest rates for the first time in</text>
  <text start="533.36" dur="6.21">almost a decade from zero to 0.25</text>
  <text start="535.61" dur="7.169">percent and then December of 2016 it did</text>
  <text start="539.57" dur="5.579">it again when it raised them to 0.5% the</text>
  <text start="542.779" dur="4.831">Fed also now just raised it once again</text>
  <text start="545.149" dur="4.44">now they came out and they said they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="547.61" dur="4.26">gonna be raising the rates many more</text>
  <text start="549.589" dur="5.37">times now there are important dates to</text>
  <text start="551.87" dur="5.399">remember because the FMO the FOMC</text>
  <text start="554.959" dur="5.13">meetings in 2017</text>
  <text start="557.269" dur="5.731">well they happen at different times</text>
  <text start="560.089" dur="4.951">during the year one is in May May 3rd</text>
  <text start="563" dur="4.89">the other one is June 14th</text>
  <text start="565.04" dur="6.18">the other one is July 26 September 20th</text>
  <text start="567.89" dur="6.389">November 1st December 13th and this is</text>
  <text start="571.22" dur="4.979">when they will come together and talk</text>
  <text start="574.279" dur="2.881">about raising the rates now they said</text>
  <text start="576.199" dur="3.931">they were going to do this you know</text>
  <text start="577.16" dur="4.14">three times this year maybe four so</text>
  <text start="580.13" dur="3">these are the dates that we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="581.3" dur="4.23">be looking at as we move forward</text>
  <text start="583.13" dur="5.55">and if they raise it let&amp;#39;s say in May or</text>
  <text start="585.53" dur="4.92">June that is another signal to let you</text>
  <text start="588.68" dur="3.51">know they&amp;#39;re gonna be bringing it down</text>
  <text start="590.45" dur="5.43">now are they just gonna raise it another</text>
  <text start="592.19" dur="6.03">25% most likely not what they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="595.88" dur="4.08">to do is they&amp;#39;re gonna raise the rates</text>
  <text start="598.22" dur="3.75">and they&amp;#39;re gonna push the rate up even</text>
  <text start="599.96" dur="3.21">higher and that&amp;#39;s how they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="601.97" dur="3.33">bring this down because they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="603.17" dur="3.72">say okay we did 25 basis points last</text>
  <text start="605.3" dur="4.08">time we&amp;#39;re gonna bring it we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="606.89" dur="5.01">raise the interest rates 50 percent this</text>
  <text start="609.38" dur="6.45">time now if we see that happen that is a</text>
  <text start="611.9" dur="5.76">signal so once this begins this is the</text>
  <text start="615.83" dur="2.16">problem the government is going to run</text>
  <text start="617.66" dur="2.1">into</text>
  <text start="617.99" dur="2.94">and I&amp;#39;m let&amp;#39;s forget about the stock</text>
  <text start="619.76" dur="2.4">market or the bond market right now</text>
  <text start="620.93" dur="3.69">because they&amp;#39;re gonna have their own</text>
  <text start="622.16" dur="5.28">problems because we know when they raise</text>
  <text start="624.62" dur="5.64">the rate well things are going to go</text>
  <text start="627.44" dur="4.77">very differently for the government</text>
  <text start="630.26" dur="4.5">because right now the government needs</text>
