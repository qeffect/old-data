  <text start="186.62" dur="8.25">like a category five and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="190.36" dur="9.879">uncanny that these things happen always</text>
  <text start="194.87" dur="7.65">at the exact time that the government</text>
  <text start="200.239" dur="5.401">one of a you know a government official</text>

  <text start="222.049" dur="7.231">has more information but it just seems</text>
  <text start="225.5" dur="6.829">very coincidental that these natural</text>
  <text start="229.28" dur="6.42">disasters always seem to happen around</text>
  <text start="232.329" dur="6.671">the time that this is happening and</text>
  <text start="235.7" dur="5.55">basically the whole IRS and all that</text>
  <text start="239" dur="3.78">stuff was pushed off of all the major</text>
  <text start="241.25" dur="4.76">news networks and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="242.78" dur="6.57">continually you know cover the Oklahoma</text>

  <text start="307.5" dur="4.02">telling us there are no bubbles which</text>
  <text start="309.21" dur="5.19">means there are because it&amp;#39;s always the</text>

  <text start="370.62" dur="6.66">plummet again and you know I hope people</text>

  <text start="404.82" dur="4.51">because especially with</text>
  <text start="407.01" dur="6.76">what the government is doing with</text>
  <text start="409.33" dur="8.31">ballons and the proposed bills and stuff</text>

  <text start="445.06" dur="7.98">again and the whole thing is starting</text>
  <text start="447.97" dur="8.1">again okay let&amp;#39;s move on now there was</text>
  <text start="453.04" dur="5.01">an interesting article in thinking World</text>
  <text start="456.07" dur="6.63">News where clients are being denied gold</text>
  <text start="458.05" dur="8.81">at major banks as shortages intensifies</text>
  <text start="462.7" dur="7.53">and basically you know people who have</text>
  <text start="466.86" dur="4.9">paper holdings are looking to turn in</text>
  <text start="470.23" dur="4.44">their paper holdings and get their</text>
  <text start="471.76" dur="7.19">physical gold and they&amp;#39;re telling them</text>
  <text start="474.67" dur="9.54">um you know that they can have them and</text>
  <text start="478.95" dur="7.3">basically it it goes on to say that you</text>
  <text start="484.21" dur="3.63">know here it says you know last week we</text>
  <text start="486.25" dur="3.45">had an investor being refused to take</text>
  <text start="487.84" dur="4.17">his physical gold out of the major Swiss</text>
  <text start="489.7" dur="4.29">bank they told him that the regulatory</text>
  <text start="492.01" dur="4.83">authority prevented the bank from giving</text>
  <text start="493.99" dur="6.32">the client his physical gold and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="496.84" dur="6.51">seeing more and more of this happening</text>
  <text start="500.31" dur="6.01">so there definitely is a disconnect</text>
  <text start="503.35" dur="5.37">between paper and physical yeah you can</text>
  <text start="506.32" dur="6">you know issue paper for one bar of gold</text>
  <text start="508.72" dur="5.97">and continually issue paper but to get</text>
  <text start="512.32" dur="6.48">the physical it&amp;#39;s much much different so</text>
  <text start="514.69" dur="7.17">we&amp;#39;re continually seeing a separation</text>
  <text start="518.8" dur="4.77">between the paper and the physical and I</text>
  <text start="521.86" dur="5.04">listen to an interview with Jim Willie</text>
  <text start="523.57" dur="5.07">and he is talking you know seven</text>
  <text start="526.9" dur="4.32">thousand gold because now people are</text>
  <text start="528.64" dur="4.74">trying to get their physical because</text>
  <text start="531.22" dur="4.08">they see what&amp;#39;s happening in the market</text>
  <text start="533.38" dur="4.59">and as more and more people see and</text>
  <text start="535.3" dur="5.43">understand more many people want their</text>
  <text start="537.97" dur="3.18">physical but again the government</text>
  <text start="540.73" dur="3.03">central</text>
  <text start="541.15" dur="7.83">bankers countries you know pushing down</text>
  <text start="543.76" dur="7.65">the paper market does not mean that the</text>
  <text start="548.98" dur="5.7">physical market is doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="551.41" dur="5.58">all the physical market doing is yet you</text>
  <text start="554.68" dur="4.2">know goal might be at 13 and change but</text>
  <text start="556.99" dur="3.6">they want another you know they want two</text>
  <text start="558.88" dur="4.05">hundred three hundred dollar premium on</text>
  <text start="560.59" dur="6.21">that gold and in some countries it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="562.93" dur="6.78">even more than that so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="566.8" dur="6.42">definite disconnect and when you see</text>
  <text start="569.71" dur="6.39">these disconnects it&amp;#39;s going to grow and</text>
  <text start="573.22" dur="6.24">it&amp;#39;s going to even further disconnect</text>
  <text start="576.1" dur="5.7">from paper to physical definitely now I</text>
  <text start="579.46" dur="6.6">know how the government likes to tell us</text>
  <text start="581.8" dur="7.17">how the job market is doing well the</text>
  <text start="586.06" dur="8.37">percentage is going down and we know</text>
  <text start="588.97" dur="7.95">that the calculation has been changed</text>
  <text start="594.43" dur="4.77">and they massage the data for</text>
  <text start="596.92" dur="7.02">unemployment GDP inflation and inflation</text>
  <text start="599.2" dur="8.15">and today ESPN ESPN is laying off</text>
  <text start="603.94" dur="6.54">hundreds of people and a tipster told</text>
  <text start="607.35" dur="6.09">Deadspin that ESPN is planning to lay</text>
  <text start="610.48" dur="7.07">off more than 400 employees today and</text>
  <text start="613.44" dur="7.21">you know basically you know ESPN</text>
  <text start="617.55" dur="6.55">confirmed it and they&amp;#39;re looking to do</text>
  <text start="620.65" dur="6.33">some reorganization and but you know if</text>
  <text start="624.1" dur="4.8">you talk to the people in ESPN one of</text>
  <text start="626.98" dur="5.4">the staffer said that for almost ten</text>
  <text start="628.9" dur="4.71">years this person worked for them for</text>
  <text start="632.38" dur="3.9">almost ten years and now they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="633.61" dur="5.73">laid off completely out of the blue and</text>
  <text start="636.28" dur="5.37">there would be a ten percent decrease</text>
  <text start="639.34" dur="3.66">across the board another laid off</text>
  <text start="641.65" dur="3.39">employee said that the layoffs are</text>
  <text start="643" dur="5.22">related to the profit margin and that</text>
  <text start="645.04" dur="6.18">ESPN has not met the number they need to</text>
  <text start="648.22" dur="5.13">me so basically they&amp;#39;re not pulling in</text>
  <text start="651.22" dur="5.01">the amount of money that they need so to</text>
  <text start="653.35" dur="4.44">cut costs the laying off people same</text>
  <text start="656.23" dur="4.98">thing happened to me back in two</text>
  <text start="657.79" dur="6.54">thousand eight they let go you know</text>
  <text start="661.21" dur="5.13">twelve hundred or so people and because</text>

  <text start="666.34" dur="3.99">this was before the crash I mean they</text>
  <text start="668.23" dur="4.2">already started doing it so we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="670.33" dur="4.77">this more and more with companies we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="672.43" dur="4.5">seeing with retail back in</text>

  <text start="687.64" dur="5.76">situation is definitely getting better</text>
  <text start="689.13" dur="6.43">according to the government all right</text>
  <text start="693.4" dur="3.72">let&amp;#39;s move on here and there was an</text>
  <text start="695.56" dur="4.59">interesting article where it says that</text>

  <text start="769.12" dur="6.03">they say it&amp;#39;s voluntary i would like</text>

  <text start="783.19" dur="8.82">let&amp;#39;s move on here now going further</text>
  <text start="787.96" dur="6.6">with this in the late 1800s when</text>
  <text start="792.01" dur="5.73">Congress first attempted to impose an</text>
  <text start="794.56" dur="5.7">income tax the notion of taxing a</text>
  <text start="797.74" dur="6.66">citizen&amp;#39;s hard work was considered</text>
  <text start="800.26" dur="6.81">radical there was a public outcry and</text>
  <text start="804.4" dur="4.129">more importantly the Supreme Court ruled</text>
  <text start="807.07" dur="4.65">the income tax</text>
  <text start="808.529" dur="6.281">constitutional only with the passage of</text>
  <text start="811.72" dur="5.07">the 16th amendment did Congress gain the</text>
  <text start="814.81" dur="6.18">ability to tax the productive endeavors</text>
  <text start="816.79" dur="6.63">of its citizen so basically the Supreme</text>
  <text start="820.99" dur="4.89">Court say it was unconstitutional so to</text>
  <text start="823.42" dur="5.219">make it constitutional they added the</text>
  <text start="825.88" dur="6.329">amendment the 16th amendment which you</text>
  <text start="828.639" dur="8.791">know is kind of ridiculous but they</text>
  <text start="832.209" dur="7.801">needed this because the Fed who prints</text>
  <text start="837.43" dur="4.469">money out of thin air that charges</text>
  <text start="840.01" dur="5.699">interest on money that&amp;#39;s printed out of</text>
  <text start="841.899" dur="6.18">thin air needed to have the people pay</text>
  <text start="845.709" dur="4.411">for that interest so they needed they</text>
  <text start="848.079" dur="5.01">needed to tax the people and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="850.12" dur="5.279">this came about and I just thought that</text>
  <text start="853.089" dur="7.891">was a very interesting thing when I was</text>
  <text start="855.399" dur="8.13">reading it okay moving on now war is</text>
  <text start="860.98" dur="8.099">definitely picking up in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="863.529" dur="8.011">and with Syria with Iran with Israel</text>

  <text start="888.519" dur="7.531">there were footing of Israeli soldiers</text>
  <text start="891.67" dur="7.229">inside of Syria so you can see this is</text>
  <text start="896.05" dur="5.67">being ramped up they need to get this</text>
  <text start="898.899" dur="4.321">war started as we know they need to get</text>
  <text start="901.72" dur="4.349">a start because they need to cover up</text>
  <text start="903.22" dur="5.84">the economic collapse and the only way</text>
  <text start="906.069" dur="5.25">to do this is with a world war and</text>
  <text start="909.06" dur="5.079">that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re continually doing</text>

  <text start="914.139" dur="4.56">and on and that&amp;#39;s why you saw North</text>
  <text start="915.55" dur="4.92">Korea with their short-range missile</text>
  <text start="918.699" dur="4.771">testing and that&amp;#39;s why they make a</text>

  <text start="923.47" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s nothing and if you look at the</text>

  <text start="1049.26" dur="7.74">through now you know me I like to talk</text>
  <text start="1054.27" dur="4.98">about cyber attacks and I saw this very</text>

  <text start="1454.66" dur="9.36">people can see that their money was</text>
  <text start="1456.85" dur="11.21">siphoned off people could see that that</text>
  <text start="1464.02" dur="8.58">another country actually did this to us</text>
  <text start="1468.06" dur="6.49">but again we can&amp;#39;t put anything past</text>
  <text start="1472.6" dur="2.89">them because we don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1474.55" dur="3.82">to happen</text>
  <text start="1475.49" dur="5.069">and we know major false flag events are</text>
  <text start="1478.37" dur="6.41">on the horizon and they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="1480.559" dur="6.841">because they are running out of options</text>
  <text start="1484.78" dur="4.779">because now I in marca watch like for</text>
  <text start="1487.4" dur="3.63">example in MarketWatch I saw the feds</text>
  <text start="1489.559" dur="6.391">saying that you know they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="1491.03" dur="10.8">to stop QE they&amp;#39;re going to continue</text>
  <text start="1495.95" dur="8.97">with QE and you know basically it says</text>
  <text start="1501.83" dur="5.729">stocks rise at as Fed signals it&amp;#39;s far</text>
  <text start="1504.92" dur="4.68">from tapering off QE and the other day</text>
  <text start="1507.559" dur="4.261">you know to see how the markets would</text>
  <text start="1509.6" dur="4.5">react they said you know that we are</text>
  <text start="1511.82" dur="3.78">going to taper off so it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1514.1" dur="3.87">interesting how they&amp;#39;re playing this</text>
  <text start="1515.6" dur="5.37">game because they know these bubbles are</text>
  <text start="1517.97" dur="4.83">building they know their balance sheet</text>
  <text start="1520.97" dur="4.17">is getting higher and higher and higher</text>
  <text start="1522.8" dur="5.52">and they&amp;#39;re up to three trillion go and</text>
  <text start="1525.14" dur="6.57">hire they know the debt of the United</text>
  <text start="1528.32" dur="6.09">States is approaching 17 trillion so</text>
  <text start="1531.71" dur="5.82">they damned if they do damned if they</text>
  <text start="1534.41" dur="6.54">don&amp;#39;t so basically they understand the</text>
  <text start="1537.53" dur="5.97">collapse is coming the bubbles are</text>
  <text start="1540.95" dur="5.24">coming when people see the bubbles and</text>
  <text start="1543.5" dur="5.28">they pop the collapse is comming</text>
  <text start="1546.19" dur="5.83">anything they know it&amp;#39;s so fragile right</text>
  <text start="1548.78" dur="7.68">now they know that anything could</text>
  <text start="1552.02" dur="7.38">trigger this one little thing one little</text>
  <text start="1556.46" dur="6.719">news bite could trigger the entire thing</text>
  <text start="1559.4" dur="5.82">and it all comes crumbling down and they</text>
  <text start="1563.179" dur="5.431">know this and they&amp;#39;re trying to figure</text>
  <text start="1565.22" dur="6.6">out a way to get around this and they</text>
  <text start="1568.61" dur="5.58">know there is no way to get around this</text>
  <text start="1571.82" dur="4.56">because if they contract the money</text>
  <text start="1574.19" dur="3.41">supply the same thing is going to happen</text>
  <text start="1576.38" dur="4.56">that happen in the Great Depression</text>
  <text start="1577.6" dur="7.36">we&amp;#39;ll go into a great depression if they</text>
  <text start="1580.94" dur="5.91">continue printing yes they can kick the</text>
  <text start="1584.96" dur="5.07">can down the street but they know these</text>
  <text start="1586.85" dur="5.79">bubbles are forming and anything at any</text>
  <text start="1590.03" dur="6.24">time can bring them down and bring them</text>
  <text start="1592.64" dur="6.12">down hard and knock us into this great</text>
  <text start="1596.27" dur="5.12">great great great great depression which</text>
  <text start="1598.76" dur="4.89">we all call an economic collapse and</text>
  <text start="1601.39" dur="6.07">this is what they&amp;#39;re trying to figure</text>
  <text start="1603.65" dur="5.04">out right now and you can tell by more</text>
  <text start="1607.46" dur="5.04">laws by</text>
  <text start="1608.69" dur="6.93">more taxing by them escalating the wars</text>
  <text start="1612.5" dur="5.37">from the distraction that they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1615.62" dur="5.64">to set up and from the false flags that</text>
  <text start="1617.87" dur="6.9">they are putting this into high gear to</text>
  <text start="1621.26" dur="5.46">figure out a quick way now out of this</text>
  <text start="1624.77" dur="4.38">because they are running out of time I</text>
  <text start="1626.72" dur="4.47">know people keep saying they can keep</text>
  <text start="1629.15" dur="6.03">doing this to 2015 they can keep doing</text>
  <text start="1631.19" dur="7.77">this but you saw how fragile the system</text>
  <text start="1635.18" dur="8.88">was when that one ap tweet came out and</text>
  <text start="1638.96" dur="6.72">made the market dive when there was just</text>
  <text start="1644.06" dur="6.03">a bomb in the White House at something</text>
  <text start="1645.68" dur="8.52">like that one little thing that goes</text>
  <text start="1650.09" dur="6">wrong this whole markets coming apart</text>
  <text start="1654.2" dur="3.48">and I don&amp;#39;t know if you ever saw that</text>
  <text start="1656.09" dur="3.57">video and I had it on setting alerts I</text>
  <text start="1657.68" dur="3.72">guess it&amp;#39;s in the archives now where</text>
  <text start="1659.66" dur="3.42">they showed that the dominoes falling</text>
  <text start="1661.4" dur="3.75">and the guy had this very tiny little</text>
  <text start="1663.08" dur="4.62">domino and how that one little tiny</text>
  <text start="1665.15" dur="7.14">domino can push all these gigantic</text>
  <text start="1667.7" dur="6.93">dominoes down and we are going to see</text>
  <text start="1672.29" dur="5.58">something happen and it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1674.63" dur="6.33">when you least expect it listen everyone</text>
  <text start="1677.87" dur="7.28">have a great day be safe be well</text>
