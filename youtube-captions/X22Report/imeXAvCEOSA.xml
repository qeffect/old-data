  <text start="250.75" dur="4.769">they&amp;#39;re going to provoke different</text>
  <text start="253.299" dur="5.281">nations right now we saw a provocation</text>
  <text start="255.519" dur="6.871">with North Korea now North Korea and</text>
  <text start="258.58" dur="7.32">South Korea they talked and they decided</text>
  <text start="262.39" dur="5.25">to defuse the tensions right now South</text>
  <text start="265.9" dur="6.71">Korea is going to remove their speakers</text>
  <text start="267.64" dur="9.33">from the border but Zoe&amp;#39;s a buddy</text>
  <text start="272.61" dur="7.72">the United States with South Korea</text>
  <text start="276.97" dur="5.55">because of what happened they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="294.99" dur="5.82">deployment of strategic US military</text>
  <text start="297.45" dur="7.38">assets to this area because this allowed</text>
  <text start="300.81" dur="7.47">them to bring more military assets into</text>
  <text start="304.83" dur="5.52">this area especially b-52s and this</text>
  <text start="308.28" dur="5.6">would be a strategic location to have</text>
  <text start="310.35" dur="7.26">this they use this to their advantage</text>
  <text start="313.88" dur="6.7">this is in preparation for World War 3</text>
  <text start="317.61" dur="7.14">remember everything that we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="320.58" dur="9.35">right now is showing us what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="324.75" dur="7.83">happen think about from when we began of</text>

  <text start="339" dur="7.62">and here we are in South Korea they are</text>
  <text start="344.07" dur="4.35">continually doing this because they know</text>
  <text start="346.62" dur="6.93">what&amp;#39;s coming they understand like I</text>
  <text start="348.42" dur="11.67">said China Russia they&amp;#39;re preparing for</text>

  <text start="363.27" dur="5.75">Putin&amp;#39;s trying to diffuse each scenario</text>
  <text start="366.45" dur="5.48">but eventually this will not work</text>
  <text start="369.02" dur="5.5">eventually something will happen and</text>
  <text start="371.93" dur="6.64">it&amp;#39;ll be out of his hands and war will</text>
  <text start="374.52" dur="7.89">start we see the US military&amp;#39;s going to</text>

  <text start="405.69" dur="8.04">percent surpassing Zimbabwe which is</text>
  <text start="411.14" dur="3.94">unbelievable because before the United</text>

  <text start="415.08" dur="8.4">their coup d&amp;#39;etat Ukraine wasn&amp;#39;t this</text>
  <text start="419.16" dur="7.62">bad I mean they&amp;#39;re in a complete</text>
  <text start="423.48" dur="6.59">collapse mode at this point</text>
  <text start="426.78" dur="5.25">humanitarian crisis war and a collapse</text>
  <text start="430.07" dur="3.34">that&amp;#39;s funny that&amp;#39;s what we see every</text>
  <text start="432.03" dur="3.38">time the United States government</text>
  <text start="433.41" dur="7.31">central bankers get involved</text>

  <text start="456.44" dur="4.84">poroshenko is not abiding by it so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="459.3" dur="3.119">not going along with peace then you have</text>
  <text start="461.28" dur="3.84">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="462.419" dur="7.621">bankers pushing war so he&amp;#39;s stuck in the</text>
  <text start="465.12" dur="9.48">middle and his time might be almost up</text>
  <text start="470.04" dur="7.83">from both sides unless he does something</text>
  <text start="474.6" dur="5.76">and it looks like he is getting ready to</text>
  <text start="477.87" dur="4.89">go all-out on the southeastern people</text>
  <text start="480.36" dur="5.07">Kiev is reportedly concentrated and</text>
  <text start="482.76" dur="7.53">regrouped military hardware close to the</text>
  <text start="485.43" dur="7.08">towns of donetsk gorlovka Mariupol and</text>
  <text start="490.29" dur="6.93">it&amp;#39;s in complete violation of the Mint&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="492.51" dur="9.33">two agreement and we see right now</text>
  <text start="497.22" dur="8.43">Russia wants to wants the OSCE to verify</text>
  <text start="501.84" dur="6.2">the data that Kiev has deployed all this</text>
  <text start="505.65" dur="4.68">heavy weaponry and so far the OSCE</text>
  <text start="508.04" dur="4.72">hasn&amp;#39;t reported back but we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="510.33" dur="5.399">check in on this and see what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="512.76" dur="5.13">going to report we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="515.729" dur="3.87">why the United States government central</text>
  <text start="517.89" dur="6.18">bankers was in their training the</text>
  <text start="519.599" dur="9.261">National Guard we see that the National</text>
  <text start="524.07" dur="8.64">Guard now is trained to crack down on</text>
  <text start="528.86" dur="7.78">popular riots if anti-war moods in</text>
  <text start="532.71" dur="7.92">Ukraine Society rise that sounds very</text>
  <text start="536.64" dur="6.06">similar where we had the FBI DHS here in</text>
  <text start="540.63" dur="4.47">the United States going after those</text>
  <text start="542.7" dur="3.889">people who protest against the</text>
  <text start="545.1" dur="9.71">government and what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="546.589" dur="12.091">those people in Kiev who basically are</text>
  <text start="554.81" dur="3.87">anti-war and what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="558.81" dur="5.94">and there is popular uprising or some</text>
  <text start="561.39" dur="7.5">type of protest guess what the National</text>
  <text start="564.75" dur="6.87">Guard&amp;#39;s going to take care of this we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="568.89" dur="4.08">seen this before in every single country</text>
  <text start="571.62" dur="5.01">the United States government central</text>
  <text start="572.97" dur="6.57">bankers goes into they always have those</text>
  <text start="576.63" dur="6.09">people they keep those who are</text>
  <text start="579.54" dur="7.88">protesting quiet I mean look at this</text>
  <text start="582.72" dur="7.02">here in the United States the FBI DHS</text>
  <text start="587.42" dur="5.98">was continually looking at the</text>
  <text start="589.74" dur="6.06">protesters at Occupy Wall Street where</text>
  <text start="593.4" dur="5.82">we have the right for the freedom of</text>
  <text start="595.8" dur="6.12">expression and the protest but they were</text>
  <text start="599.22" dur="6.78">still watching them getting ready to</text>
  <text start="601.92" dur="5.609">take some of these people out and this</text>
  <text start="606" dur="3.63">is happening all over the country</text>
  <text start="607.529" dur="5.191">so what is it whatever is happening out</text>
  <text start="609.63" dur="5.06">in Ukraine in the Middle East and you</text>
  <text start="612.72" dur="5.01">see how the people are treated there</text>
  <text start="614.69" dur="4.96">that&amp;#39;s how they would love to treat the</text>
  <text start="617.73" dur="5.52">people here the only thing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="619.65" dur="6.45">stopping them is the Constitution Bill</text>
  <text start="623.25" dur="4.95">of Rights but eventually what they like</text>
  <text start="626.1" dur="5.52">to do is completely get rid of that then</text>
  <text start="628.2" dur="5.88">all bets are off we see Russia is</text>
  <text start="631.62" dur="5.01">training in the Arctic they have two</text>
  <text start="634.08" dur="4.14">large Russian landing ships that have</text>
  <text start="636.63" dur="4.47">arrived in the Arctic to take part in</text>
  <text start="638.22" dur="4.8">naval drills we know they&amp;#39;re setting up</text>
  <text start="641.1" dur="3.51">defense missile systems there we</text>
  <text start="643.02" dur="4.23">understand the United States Canada are</text>
  <text start="644.61" dur="8.34">also setting up defense missile systems</text>
  <text start="647.25" dur="9.15">there and there is a run to the Arctic</text>
  <text start="652.95" dur="6.6">strategic location and oil natural gas</text>
  <text start="656.4" dur="7.53">under the ice because that&amp;#39;s what it</text>
  <text start="659.55" dur="7.92">always comes down to we see now in Yemen</text>
  <text start="663.93" dur="5.97">the Yemeni Houthis have taken control of</text>
  <text start="667.47" dur="8.42">at least two Saudi army bases in the</text>
  <text start="669.9" dur="9.33">border province they&amp;#39;ve captured them</text>
  <text start="675.89" dur="6.25">this war there is getting harder and</text>
  <text start="679.23" dur="5.49">harder it&amp;#39;s not going as smoothly as</text>
  <text start="682.14" dur="7.05">they wanted and what&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="684.72" dur="6.66">Yemen in Libya and Lebanon Iraq the</text>
  <text start="689.19" dur="3.48">people are rising up they&amp;#39;re fighting</text>
  <text start="691.38" dur="3.96">back</text>
  <text start="692.67" dur="5.16">and eventually they will overrun those</text>
  <text start="695.34" dur="5.46">puppet governments eventually what will</text>
  <text start="697.83" dur="4.86">happen is they will not sell the oil</text>
  <text start="700.8" dur="4.5">using the petrodollar we already see it</text>
  <text start="702.69" dur="5.91">in Libya the government that&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="705.3" dur="5.01">Tripoli is selling the oil governments</text>
  <text start="708.6" dur="3.03">will not do business with the central</text>
  <text start="710.31" dur="2.94">bank that was moved out of Tripoli</text>
  <text start="711.63" dur="3.63">because they&amp;#39;re trying to sell the oil</text>
  <text start="713.25" dur="4.53">at the same time but no one&amp;#39;s dealing</text>
  <text start="715.26" dur="6.6">with them and eventually they will not</text>
  <text start="717.78" dur="6.6">use the dollar anymore the whole system</text>
  <text start="721.86" dur="5.91">is coming apart now we understand the</text>
  <text start="724.38" dur="5.54">whole point of the Islamic state out in</text>
  <text start="727.77" dur="4.68">the Middle East is to create chaos</text>
  <text start="729.92" dur="3.67">because they have to mask what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="732.45" dur="3.09">going on there and that&amp;#39;s the people</text>
  <text start="733.59" dur="4.32">rising up they&amp;#39;re also using the Islamic</text>
  <text start="735.54" dur="4.68">state as a proxy Army in Syria to get</text>
  <text start="737.91" dur="4.8">Assad and we always knew from the</text>
  <text start="740.22" dur="5.9">beginning that their plan was to break</text>
  <text start="742.71" dur="7.32">up Iraq Syria Libya Lebanon Yemen and</text>
  <text start="746.12" dur="6.49">create a Shiite country a Sunni country</text>
  <text start="750.03" dur="6.57">and a Kurd country and we see that Joe</text>
  <text start="752.61" dur="7.64">Biden once again has said you know</text>
  <text start="756.6" dur="10.02">something maybe we should split up</text>
  <text start="760.25" dur="8.83">Iraq into Shiite Sunni and Kurds and we</text>
  <text start="766.62" dur="5.25">see that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey</text>
  <text start="769.08" dur="5.76">Lavrov said absolutely not we are not</text>
  <text start="771.87" dur="6.75">splitting anything up whatsoever it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="774.84" dur="8.16">unacceptable if Iraq would like this</text>
  <text start="778.62" dur="10.83">done it should be their choice I agree</text>
  <text start="783" dur="9.12">if that country wants to split up let</text>
  <text start="789.45" dur="5.19">them handle it the United States has no</text>
  <text start="792.12" dur="4.38">business doing it but we know why they</text>
  <text start="794.64" dur="5.22">want to do it because they need to keep</text>
