  <text start="45.89" dur="5.88">big is about to happen let&amp;#39;s get into</text>
  <text start="49.01" dur="5.46">the economic collapse political and</text>
  <text start="51.77" dur="5.219">geopolitical news now in past reports</text>
  <text start="54.47" dur="6.96">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about the FBI Apple</text>
  <text start="56.989" dur="8.971">how we knew this whole entire agenda was</text>
  <text start="61.43" dur="9.57">to try somehow some way to get the keys</text>
  <text start="65.96" dur="8.34">to the entire cell phone system to spy</text>
  <text start="71" dur="5.52">on every single person and the FBI</text>
  <text start="74.3" dur="5.04">realized they were getting absolutely no</text>
  <text start="76.52" dur="5.37">traction and the whole story of them</text>
  <text start="79.34" dur="5.4">breaking into the iphone that they just</text>
  <text start="81.89" dur="5.22">can&amp;#39;t do it it&amp;#39;s too difficult we always</text>
  <text start="84.74" dur="4.98">knew that this was completely false it</text>
  <text start="87.11" dur="4.5">was fake phony and false and we see at</text>
  <text start="89.72" dur="4.8">this point it&amp;#39;s all over the corporate</text>
  <text start="91.61" dur="5.07">media that the FBI they were able to</text>
  <text start="94.52" dur="4.41">successfully hack the terrorist phone</text>
  <text start="96.68" dur="5.9">and they were able to do it without</text>
  <text start="98.93" dur="8.55">apples help well we knew this before</text>
  <text start="102.58" dur="7.78">actually John McAfee he did it and we</text>
  <text start="107.48" dur="7.56">knew that this wasn&amp;#39;t difficult to do</text>
  <text start="110.36" dur="6.87">the FBI was playing a game the game</text>
  <text start="115.04" dur="5.52">wasn&amp;#39;t going in their direction and they</text>
  <text start="117.23" dur="6.57">needed a safe way to get out of it so</text>
  <text start="120.56" dur="6.42">they have now dropped the case against</text>
  <text start="123.8" dur="6.17">Apple at this point and we can see well</text>
  <text start="126.98" dur="7.02">this scheme didn&amp;#39;t work on to the next</text>
  <text start="129.97" dur="8.5">now out in Belgium we realize the false</text>
  <text start="134" dur="6.629">flag is now being pushed in all</text>
  <text start="138.47" dur="4.799">different directions one of the agendas</text>
  <text start="140.629" dur="5.58">as we&amp;#39;ve said before is that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="143.269" dur="4.231">going to need more security that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="146.209" dur="4.11">going to be certain they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="147.5" dur="5.73">need some type of law like the US has</text>
  <text start="150.319" dur="5.221">where they can spy on the people they</text>
  <text start="153.23" dur="3.81">could have more security take away the</text>
  <text start="155.54" dur="6.99">rights of the people and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="157.04" dur="7.5">interesting is that ex CIA chief is out</text>
  <text start="162.53" dur="4.53">there and that&amp;#39;s director Michael Hayden</text>
  <text start="164.54" dur="5.009">he&amp;#39;s saying that the European Union has</text>
  <text start="167.06" dur="4.92">incredibly high standards for privacy</text>
  <text start="169.549" dur="5.22">rights and the rules made in Brussels</text>
  <text start="171.98" dur="6.69">may be hindering the ability of a member</text>
  <text start="174.769" dur="6.661">nation to fight terrorism he says what</text>
  <text start="178.67" dur="5.399">you&amp;#39;ve got our folks in Brussels the</text>
  <text start="181.43" dur="4.619">Euro institutions imposing incredibly</text>
  <text start="184.069" dur="4.321">high standards with regard to personal</text>
  <text start="186.049" dur="3.871">privacy of expense of what the national</text>
  <text start="188.39" dur="5.249">governments are still expected to do</text>
  <text start="189.92" dur="5.64">which is keep their citizens alive no</text>
  <text start="193.639" dur="5.88">that&amp;#39;s not what they&amp;#39;re supposed to be</text>
  <text start="195.56" dur="7.23">doing and what they&amp;#39;re doing at this</text>
  <text start="199.519" dur="6.571">point they&amp;#39;re making the case for people</text>
  <text start="202.79" dur="7.74">to give up their rights which will allow</text>
  <text start="206.09" dur="6.599">them access to all the private data to</text>
  <text start="210.53" dur="4.349">control the people to spy on them just</text>
  <text start="212.689" dur="4.371">like they did here in the United States</text>
  <text start="214.879" dur="4.86">and you can see they&amp;#39;re definitely</text>
  <text start="217.06" dur="6.609">pushing all of this in that direction</text>
  <text start="219.739" dur="7.92">now the government&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re not put in</text>
  <text start="223.669" dur="7.981">a place to keep us alive the governments</text>
  <text start="227.659" dur="7.531">are put into place to work with the</text>
  <text start="231.65" dur="7.44">people to support the people not to have</text>
  <text start="235.19" dur="10.56">false flags not to scare people to get</text>
  <text start="239.09" dur="8.579">bigger budgets not to spy on people but</text>
  <text start="245.75" dur="5.909">we can see the mentality of the</text>
  <text start="247.669" dur="9.47">government and these agencies it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.659" dur="8.36">absolutely ridiculous now out in Brazil</text>
  <text start="257.139" dur="7.451">everything is really falling apart and</text>
  <text start="260.019" dur="7.241">we see that Rousseff&amp;#39;s coalition has</text>
  <text start="264.59" dur="5.549">completely collapsed it looks like</text>
  <text start="267.26" dur="6.3">they&amp;#39;re moving for impeachment and we</text>
  <text start="270.139" dur="5.371">see tammer&amp;#39;s PMDB has announced a split</text>
  <text start="273.56" dur="5.52">with President Rousseff coalition</text>
  <text start="275.51" dur="7.58">government and it seems that there is a</text>
  <text start="279.08" dur="5.94">coup d&amp;#39;etat happening now in Brazil and</text>
  <text start="283.09" dur="4.93">we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch that</text>
  <text start="285.02" dur="5.03">situation very carefully we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="288.02" dur="4.85">see what happens</text>
  <text start="290.05" dur="8.609">and we see things are rapidly falling</text>
  <text start="292.87" dur="9.329">apart now France is out there and they</text>
  <text start="298.659" dur="7.491">are making urgent calls saying that the</text>
  <text start="302.199" dur="8.25">Libya unity government must be set up</text>
  <text start="306.15" dur="7.449">there&amp;#39;s no more time to waste we must</text>
  <text start="310.449" dur="5.131">have the unity government in Tripoli now</text>
  <text start="313.599" dur="4.021">they can keep screaming about this all</text>
  <text start="315.58" dur="4.019">they want it doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="317.62" dur="5.46">happen because the elected government in</text>
  <text start="319.599" dur="7.711">Tripoli doesn&amp;#39;t want this puppet</text>
  <text start="323.08" dur="5.7">government in their country and we can</text>
  <text start="327.31" dur="4.74">see right now they&amp;#39;re continually making</text>
  <text start="328.78" dur="6.18">these urgent calls because if this unity</text>
  <text start="332.05" dur="5.459">government is not put into place we know</text>
  <text start="334.96" dur="6.35">it&amp;#39;s going to happen they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="337.509" dur="7.681">invade Libya one way or another</text>
  <text start="341.31" dur="5.77">something will occur and they will</text>
  <text start="345.19" dur="3.689">invade now the unity government does get</text>
  <text start="347.08" dur="3.57">into Tripoli the unity government is</text>
  <text start="348.879" dur="3.331">going to invite in the coalition forces</text>
  <text start="350.65" dur="4.98">and they&amp;#39;re going to be going after all</text>
  <text start="352.21" dur="5.609">those people who are against the puppet</text>
  <text start="355.63" dur="4.62">government all those people will then be</text>
  <text start="357.819" dur="6">called terrorists like Al Qaeda and they</text>
  <text start="360.25" dur="7.13">will hunt them down and we know there</text>
  <text start="363.819" dur="6.15">are special op teams already in Libya</text>
  <text start="367.38" dur="5.469">probably making preparations to take out</text>
  <text start="369.969" dur="5.371">the government in Tripoli we know the UK</text>
  <text start="372.849" dur="6.091">has troops there we know Jordan we know</text>
  <text start="375.34" dur="4.889">the u.s. we know France and I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="378.94" dur="5.099">be surprised of plans are in motion</text>
  <text start="380.229" dur="5.791">right now to try to remove the elected</text>
  <text start="384.039" dur="7.021">government in Tripoli so the unity</text>
  <text start="386.02" dur="8.25">government can walk on in now in past</text>
  <text start="391.06" dur="6.75">reports we reported on Lebanon how Saudi</text>
  <text start="394.27" dur="6.989">Arabia Qatar US and other countries were</text>
  <text start="397.81" dur="7.289">removing their government officials from</text>
  <text start="401.259" dur="6.09">Lebanon and they put up travel alerts</text>
  <text start="405.099" dur="4.41">warnings saying you know don&amp;#39;t go to</text>
  <text start="407.349" dur="6.241">Lebanon and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="409.509" dur="5.34">since Syria where Russia and the Syrian</text>
  <text start="413.59" dur="4.259">armed forces have been pushing the</text>
  <text start="414.849" dur="6">Islamic state out of the country a lot</text>
  <text start="417.849" dur="6.151">of the Islamic state fighters are now</text>
  <text start="420.849" dur="6.091">crossing into Lebanon and</text>
  <text start="424" dur="5.85">are seeing a buildup of the Islamic</text>
  <text start="426.94" dur="4.17">state on the border of Lebanon because</text>
  <text start="429.85" dur="3.21">as we know the Syrian army and the</text>
  <text start="431.11" dur="4.83">Russian forces have been liberating all</text>
  <text start="433.06" dur="6.06">these towns and cities and they needed a</text>
  <text start="435.94" dur="6.39">place for these fighters to go now of</text>
  <text start="439.12" dur="7.32">course Lebanon borders Syria turkey</text>
  <text start="442.33" dur="6.3">borders Syria Jordan borders Syria and</text>
  <text start="446.44" dur="4.95">we&amp;#39;re going to have to watch this</text>
  <text start="448.63" dur="5.04">situation very very carefully because we</text>
  <text start="451.39" dur="6.12">see things are starting to build up heat</text>
  <text start="453.67" dur="8.37">up in this area and we can see a new</text>
  <text start="457.51" dur="8.54">plan is forming at this point and we see</text>
  <text start="462.04" dur="7.17">the director of the CIA William Brennan</text>
  <text start="466.05" dur="6.15">he&amp;#39;s out there saying that the u.s.</text>
  <text start="469.21" dur="5.58">still demands the removal of Assad and</text>
  <text start="472.2" dur="4.54">he wants Assad to follow through on</text>
  <text start="474.79" dur="5.31">their agreements to implement the</text>
  <text start="476.74" dur="6.6">cessation of hostilities in Syria he</text>
  <text start="480.1" dur="6.36">also says the US government&amp;#39;s consistent</text>
  <text start="483.34" dur="5.37">support for genuine political transition</text>
  <text start="486.46" dur="5.22">in Syria and the need for assads</text>
  <text start="488.71" dur="5.25">departure in order to facilitate a</text>
  <text start="491.68" dur="5.34">transition that reflects the will of the</text>
  <text start="493.96" dur="6.9">Syrian people now it sounds great it</text>
  <text start="497.02" dur="8.04">sounds fantastic that the will of the</text>
  <text start="500.86" dur="6.15">Syrian people the problem is the Western</text>
  <text start="505.06" dur="4.47">governments they&amp;#39;ve been doing polls in</text>
  <text start="507.01" dur="4.74">this entire area to see that and get a</text>
  <text start="509.53" dur="4.49">read on what the people are thinking and</text>
  <text start="511.75" dur="4.919">what they&amp;#39;re doing so there are many</text>
  <text start="514.02" dur="5.22">different Western polling firms that</text>
  <text start="516.669" dur="5.041">have been pulling the Syrian people and</text>
  <text start="519.24" dur="5.77">they&amp;#39;ve been asking questions like you</text>
  <text start="521.71" dur="6.6">know do you support Assad as being the</text>
  <text start="525.01" dur="5.52">Syrian leader would you vote for Assad</text>
  <text start="528.31" dur="3.75">once again and they&amp;#39;re finding out that</text>
  <text start="530.53" dur="3.66">fifty-five percent of the Syrian saying</text>
  <text start="532.06" dur="4.38">yes they support Assad as being the</text>
  <text start="534.19" dur="3.96">leader now the Western polling firms</text>
  <text start="536.44" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;ve done other polls where they said</text>
  <text start="538.15" dur="7.08">who is to blame for all of this in Syria</text>
  <text start="541.36" dur="6.63">and the poll shows that eighty-two</text>
  <text start="545.23" dur="7.05">percent of Syrians they&amp;#39;re blaming the</text>
  <text start="547.99" dur="5.82">US for what has happened in Syria the</text>
  <text start="552.28" dur="4.44">same poll found that seventy nine</text>
  <text start="553.81" dur="3.75">percent agree that foreign fighters made</text>
  <text start="556.72" dur="3.93">war</text>
  <text start="557.56" dur="7.14">worse it also found that seventy percent</text>
  <text start="560.65" dur="9.06">agree that they do not want their</text>
  <text start="564.7" dur="8.04">country divided so I know the u.s. is</text>
  <text start="569.71" dur="6.69">continually using propaganda and spewing</text>
  <text start="572.74" dur="7.14">the idea that the people do not support</text>
  <text start="576.4" dur="6.54">Assad but from every action from the</text>
  <text start="579.88" dur="6.51">people we see the opposite happening</text>
  <text start="582.94" dur="6.69">back in 2014 they had elections they</text>
  <text start="586.39" dur="5.16">were monitored internationally Assad won</text>
  <text start="589.63" dur="6.87">by like eighty to eighty seven eighty</text>
  <text start="591.55" dur="8.43">five percent today if there was a vote</text>
  <text start="596.5" dur="6.18">the US knows that the people of Syria</text>
  <text start="599.98" dur="6.51">they&amp;#39;re going to vote for Assad think</text>
  <text start="602.68" dur="6.27">about it he worked with Russia they got</text>
  <text start="606.49" dur="6.3">rid of the terrorists in Syria they</text>
  <text start="608.95" dur="6.99">liberated towns and cities and freed the</text>
  <text start="612.79" dur="7.08">people of torture and living under the</text>
  <text start="615.94" dur="5.82">rule of terrorism why wouldn&amp;#39;t they vote</text>
  <text start="619.87" dur="4.89">for him and the US knows this and they</text>
  <text start="621.76" dur="5.34">can&amp;#39;t let this go to a vote because</text>
  <text start="624.76" dur="5.43">their entire scheme would go down the</text>
  <text start="627.1" dur="6.42">drain their entire plan would be ruined</text>
  <text start="630.19" dur="5.88">at this point now we know that John</text>
  <text start="633.52" dur="6.78">Kerry met with Sergey Lavrov in Russia</text>
  <text start="636.07" dur="5.97">and they discussed the transition in</text>
  <text start="640.3" dur="4.2">Syria they discussed a draft</text>
  <text start="642.04" dur="4.82">constitution and they were going to</text>
  <text start="644.5" dur="4.62">revisit this in August and right now</text>
  <text start="646.86" dur="4.17">Russia is saying it is completely</text>
  <text start="649.12" dur="4.68">impossible to name a specific date of</text>
  <text start="651.03" dur="5.86">when this draft constitution is going to</text>
  <text start="653.8" dur="5.58">be ready and remember they can&amp;#39;t come up</text>
  <text start="656.89" dur="4.89">with a constitution unless the Syrian</text>
  <text start="659.38" dur="5.88">government is involved and the Syrian</text>
  <text start="661.78" dur="6.9">government wasn&amp;#39;t really in this meeting</text>
  <text start="665.26" dur="7.43">between Russia and the US so at this</text>
  <text start="668.68" dur="8.22">point nothing really has been planned</text>
  <text start="672.69" dur="7.12">now we heard John Kerry talk about Plan</text>
  <text start="676.9" dur="6.99">B about splitting up Syria but really</text>
  <text start="679.81" dur="10.58">plan B was never plan B plan B is really</text>
  <text start="683.89" dur="6.5">plan a and if negotiations fail</text>
  <text start="690.69" dur="7.56">the reality is they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="693.21" dur="7.08">trying to push plan a plans to balkanize</text>
  <text start="698.25" dur="6.12">Syria Iraq and other middle eastern</text>
  <text start="700.29" dur="6.03">states were laid out a long time ago by</text>
  <text start="704.37" dur="4.8">US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice</text>
  <text start="706.32" dur="6.21">in 2006 it was part of the so-called</text>
  <text start="709.17" dur="6.36">project for a new Middle East this was a</text>
  <text start="712.53" dur="6.27">carbon copy of the oh did Union plan</text>
  <text start="715.53" dur="5.34">drawn up in Israel 1982 the plan</text>
  <text start="718.8" dur="3.57">outlined the way in which Middle Eastern</text>
  <text start="720.87" dur="5.16">countries would be balkanized along</text>
  <text start="722.37" dur="5.25">sectarian lines and Syria right now is</text>
  <text start="726.03" dur="4.91">saying that now this is not going to</text>
  <text start="727.62" dur="7.83">work we don&amp;#39;t want to be federalized and</text>
  <text start="730.94" dur="7.69">it&amp;#39;s not going to happen because we say</text>
  <text start="735.45" dur="6.93">it&amp;#39;s not going to and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="738.63" dur="7.62">is that if they decided to split up the</text>
  <text start="742.38" dur="6.54">middle east what they&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="746.25" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re just going to draw along</text>
  <text start="748.92" dur="6.98">sectarian lines and they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="751.62" dur="7.29">consider you know if any state or</text>
  <text start="755.9" dur="4.48">population can sustain itself this means</text>
  <text start="758.91" dur="4.2">that a small amount of people will get</text>
  <text start="760.38" dur="4.68">all the resources and we know which ones</text>

  <text start="828.79" dur="6.84">a lot of this stuff that&amp;#39;s happening is</text>
  <text start="831.84" dur="6.88">happening behind the scenes where the</text>
  <text start="835.63" dur="5.04">president is out there and the corporate</text>
  <text start="838.72" dur="4.77">media is out there trying to convince us</text>

  <text start="849.49" dur="7.29">the u.s. is working with turkey vetoing</text>
  <text start="853.18" dur="7.17">like the Russian UN Security resolution</text>
  <text start="856.78" dur="7.8">which tried to stop turkey from shelling</text>
  <text start="860.35" dur="6.27">into Syria now of course the corporate</text>

  <text start="1053.94" dur="4.47">peace talks they&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="1056.55" dur="8.88">absolutely nowhere because they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1058.41" dur="8.4">allow Assad to stay in power we saw and</text>
  <text start="1065.43" dur="4.26">we talked about the Western polls</text>
  <text start="1066.81" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re not in the favor of the US so</text>
  <text start="1069.69" dur="4.14">now they&amp;#39;re moving in a completely</text>
  <text start="1071.37" dur="5.61">different direction and they&amp;#39;re planning</text>
  <text start="1073.83" dur="6.78">something behind the scenes and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1076.98" dur="7.62">just waiting for the big bang now the</text>
  <text start="1080.61" dur="6.36">last two days we see the capital was on</text>
  <text start="1084.6" dur="4.59">lockdown first we had a shooter and it</text>
  <text start="1086.97" dur="4.8">looks like there was some type of drill</text>
  <text start="1089.19" dur="5.58">going on at the same time</text>
  <text start="1091.77" dur="5.34">and we also see that it was locked down</text>
  <text start="1094.77" dur="3.9">for a suspicious package now why is all</text>
  <text start="1097.11" dur="4.89">this happening in the capital at this</text>
  <text start="1098.67" dur="7.17">point well most likely is to pass new</text>
  <text start="1102" dur="6">laws to bring in more security to lock</text>
  <text start="1105.84" dur="3.84">down government buildings why do they</text>
  <text start="1108" dur="4.14">want to lock down government buildings</text>
  <text start="1109.68" dur="4.76">because they realize as the collapse</text>
  <text start="1112.14" dur="6.51">comes they need more and more security</text>
  <text start="1114.44" dur="7.33">they need more forces involved in</text>
  <text start="1118.65" dur="4.86">protecting their interests and this is</text>
  <text start="1121.77" dur="3.42">why we&amp;#39;re seeing all this and I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1123.51" dur="4.02">be surprised the next couple of days all</text>
  <text start="1125.19" dur="4.68">of a sudden they say oh yes we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1127.53" dur="6.33">putting up fences we&amp;#39;re bringing in more</text>
  <text start="1129.87" dur="7.88">security and we&amp;#39;re creating a larger</text>
  <text start="1133.86" dur="3.89">buffer zone in front of these buildings</text>
  <text start="1138.17" dur="10.33">now the United States is aware of</text>
  <text start="1142.91" dur="8.92">terrorists to get raw materials to make</text>
  <text start="1148.5" dur="5.58">nuclear devices the u.s. right now</text>
  <text start="1151.83" dur="5.28">estimates there are about two thousand</text>
  <text start="1154.08" dur="5.04">metric tons of usable nuclear materials</text>
  <text start="1157.11" dur="4.05">that terrorists have the intent and</text>

  <text start="1161.16" dur="5.49">devices we know that terrorists have the</text>
  <text start="1164.82" dur="4.17">intent and the capability to turn the</text>
  <text start="1166.65" dur="6.51">raw materials into nuclear devices and</text>
  <text start="1168.99" dur="8.36">use them on the public we know Israel</text>
