  <text start="64.34" dur="6.09">episode is something is brewing in</text>
  <text start="66.86" dur="6.3">Jordan and it mimics past events let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="70.43" dur="5.52">get into the economic collapse political</text>
  <text start="73.16" dur="4.62">energy of political news now at this</text>
  <text start="75.95" dur="4.68">point we&amp;#39;ve come to realize that</text>
  <text start="77.78" dur="5.22">Obamacare well it&amp;#39;s pretty much due now</text>
  <text start="80.63" dur="4.23">I&amp;#39;m hearing reports that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="83" dur="3.9">starting to blame this all on Trump this</text>
  <text start="84.86" dur="4.95">is why Obamacare is not doing well</text>
  <text start="86.9" dur="4.829">well we know that&amp;#39;s completely fake</text>
  <text start="89.81" dur="3.78">phony and false because we&amp;#39;ve been found</text>
  <text start="91.729" dur="5.101">this from the beginning and we know out</text>
  <text start="93.59" dur="6.36">of the 25 exchanges almost actually more</text>
  <text start="96.83" dur="5.19">than half have gone bankrupt and we know</text>
  <text start="99.95" dur="5.37">a lot of insurance companies have</text>
  <text start="102.02" dur="6.54">completely backed out way before Trump</text>
  <text start="105.32" dur="5.34">was even president so we know that this</text>
  <text start="108.56" dur="4.169">has nothing to do with the new president</text>
  <text start="110.66" dur="5.22">who is in office we knew that Obamacare</text>
  <text start="112.729" dur="5.43">was dying a slow death from the very</text>
  <text start="115.88" dur="3.42">beginning and we can see that more and</text>
  <text start="118.159" dur="3.841">more insurance companies they are</text>
  <text start="119.3" dur="4.83">leaving Obamacare we reported on</text>
  <text start="122" dur="4.26">Medicare they are leaving</text>
  <text start="124.13" dur="4.59">Iowa&amp;#39;s exchanges and now it is</text>
  <text start="126.26" dur="5.46">completely emptying Aetna CEO Mark</text>
  <text start="128.72" dur="5.19">Bertolini said that if Obamacare does</text>
  <text start="131.72" dur="4.799">not get fixed and nothing happens to it</text>
  <text start="133.91" dur="6.03">it&amp;#39;s going to continue to deteriorate</text>
  <text start="136.519" dur="5.421">what do you mean get fixed what do you</text>
  <text start="139.94" dur="4.41">mean do something with it</text>
  <text start="141.94" dur="6.85">what&amp;#39;s the problem I thought this was an</text>
  <text start="144.35" dur="6.84">incredible program it isn&amp;#39;t because the</text>
  <text start="148.79" dur="4.62">people are not going along with it</text>
  <text start="151.19" dur="5.07">remember when you have something really</text>
  <text start="153.41" dur="5.1">really great and the people love it</text>
  <text start="156.26" dur="3.36">let&amp;#39;s take the iPhone for example that</text>
  <text start="158.51" dur="6.09">mean there&amp;#39;s people that don&amp;#39;t like the</text>
  <text start="159.62" dur="7.89">iPhone but the iPhone is an incredible</text>
  <text start="164.6" dur="7.02">piece of electronics it&amp;#39;s very easy to</text>
  <text start="167.51" dur="9.57">use and many people purchase it because</text>
  <text start="171.62" dur="7.49">it&amp;#39;s easy to use and people like it they</text>
  <text start="177.08" dur="4.56">don&amp;#39;t have to advertise that much and</text>
  <text start="179.11" dur="5.02">people will get it and they&amp;#39;ll get the</text>
  <text start="181.64" dur="5.65">new one if they have the money just to</text>
  <text start="184.13" dur="5.65">have it if the health in</text>
  <text start="187.29" dur="4.89">pterence program that obamacare put out</text>
  <text start="189.78" dur="5.73">there was so great people wouldn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="192.18" dur="8.25">question it they would say this benefit</text>
  <text start="195.51" dur="8.64">is fantastic I need to have it and if it</text>
  <text start="200.43" dur="5.16">was affordable forget about it and we</text>
  <text start="204.15" dur="3.78">can see that Aetna they backed out</text>
  <text start="205.59" dur="5.06">because they were losing too much money</text>
  <text start="207.93" dur="5.04">because remember when they created the</text>
  <text start="210.65" dur="3.61">insurance bill some day thought they</text>
  <text start="212.97" dur="3.87">were going to make all of this money</text>
  <text start="214.26" dur="5.58">this is why in the bill they put out a</text>
  <text start="216.84" dur="4.34">bailout clause that they would get the</text>
  <text start="219.84" dur="5.489">money no matter what</text>
  <text start="221.18" dur="6.25">now again who is this really benefiting</text>
  <text start="225.329" dur="4.651">the insurance company now the new health</text>
  <text start="227.43" dur="4.529">insurance well that is the same exact</text>
  <text start="229.98" dur="4.47">thing that we have now with a different</text>
  <text start="231.959" dur="5.67">name on it and will it get passed the</text>
  <text start="234.45" dur="7.86">Senate most likely not now today we had</text>
  <text start="237.629" dur="7.95">this story out about how Obama warned</text>
  <text start="242.31" dur="5.039">Trump about hiring Flynn now it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="245.579" dur="4.02">interesting that they decided to come</text>
  <text start="247.349" dur="6.51">out with the story right before Yates</text>
  <text start="249.599" dur="6.181">was testifying in front of Congress so</text>
  <text start="253.859" dur="3.541">what was the corporate media trying to</text>
  <text start="255.78" dur="4.379">do what was the deep state trying to do</text>
  <text start="257.4" dur="5.34">with this story well they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="260.159" dur="5.551">paint a narrative around a kind-hearted</text>
  <text start="262.74" dur="5.64">Obama where he was looking out for the</text>
  <text start="265.71" dur="6.9">best interest of Trump and warning Trump</text>
  <text start="268.38" dur="6.06">that listen I wouldn&amp;#39;t hire Flynn and we</text>
  <text start="272.61" dur="4.619">know this is completely fake phony and</text>
  <text start="274.44" dur="4.44">false we know that general Flynn was</text>
  <text start="277.229" dur="5">given the high security clinches by the</text>
  <text start="278.88" dur="5.909">Obama administration but the fake news</text>
  <text start="282.229" dur="4.841">they don&amp;#39;t want to report on any of this</text>
  <text start="284.789" dur="3.841">they&amp;#39;d rather make up stories because</text>
  <text start="287.07" dur="4.56">they knew that Yates was going to</text>
  <text start="288.63" dur="6.029">testify now listening to Yates and</text>
  <text start="291.63" dur="6">listening to clapper they pretty much</text>
  <text start="294.659" dur="4.531">said nothing and they keep saying oh</text>
  <text start="297.63" dur="2.67">this is classified I can&amp;#39;t tell you who</text>
  <text start="299.19" dur="3.42">I am as it&amp;#39;s classified</text>
  <text start="300.3" dur="4.56">instead of Congress instead of all these</text>
  <text start="302.61" dur="3.69">idiots sitting around there asking them</text>
  <text start="304.86" dur="3.779">questions which they know they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="306.3" dur="6.149">answer why don&amp;#39;t they do the most</text>
  <text start="308.639" dur="5.131">simplest thing one get a warrant first</text>
  <text start="312.449" dur="4.051">of all let me just back up for a second</text>
  <text start="313.77" dur="4.68">Dianne Feinstein she was out there and</text>
  <text start="316.5" dur="4.11">she was quoting the world The Wall</text>
  <text start="318.45" dur="2.64">Street Journal first of all don&amp;#39;t bring</text>
  <text start="320.61" dur="2.339">the core</text>
  <text start="321.09" dur="4.92">Media into this have your own</text>
  <text start="322.949" dur="6.421">investigation don&amp;#39;t quote what the</text>
  <text start="326.01" dur="5.31">newspapers have said you better have</text>
  <text start="329.37" dur="3.57">your own investigation that proves</text>
  <text start="331.32" dur="3.99">something and right now they have</text>
  <text start="332.94" dur="5.28">absolutely nothing nothing was produced</text>
  <text start="335.31" dur="5.07">nothing was said all they kept on saying</text>
  <text start="338.22" dur="3.57">everything was classified so what they</text>
  <text start="340.38" dur="2.19">need to do instead of having these</text>
  <text start="341.79" dur="3.8">ridiculous</text>
  <text start="342.57" dur="6.53">talks on TV and it&amp;#39;s a three-ring circus</text>
  <text start="345.59" dur="6.85">we know there&amp;#39;s a paper trail we know</text>
  <text start="349.1" dur="7.42">because they keep telling us that yes</text>
  <text start="352.44" dur="7.47">they keep records get a warrant and get</text>
  <text start="356.52" dur="6.209">the information if this whole entire</text>
  <text start="359.91" dur="5.37">thing is a real national security threat</text>
  <text start="362.729" dur="5.311">you don&amp;#39;t think at this point in time if</text>
  <text start="365.28" dur="4.92">there really was Russian collusion and</text>
  <text start="368.04" dur="4.68">there&amp;#39;s a national security threat that</text>
  <text start="370.2" dur="4.969">all this classified information and</text>
  <text start="372.72" dur="5.819">getting the paperwork of who actually</text>
  <text start="375.169" dur="5.801">unmasked the information how hard is</text>
  <text start="378.539" dur="4.891">this to get who signed off on it why is</text>
  <text start="380.97" dur="5.04">this so difficult because they know</text>
  <text start="383.43" dur="5.13">there&amp;#39;s nothing there and if they find</text>
  <text start="386.01" dur="5.34">those individuals and they let it out</text>
  <text start="388.56" dur="4.859">that these individuals signed off on</text>
  <text start="391.35" dur="4.95">something that wasn&amp;#39;t there they broke</text>
  <text start="393.419" dur="6.031">the law this is why they&amp;#39;ll never go</text>
  <text start="396.3" dur="4.98">through with this this is why they they</text>
  <text start="399.45" dur="4.62">have these three-ring circus</text>
  <text start="401.28" dur="6.359">hearings where nothing has ever said I</text>
  <text start="404.07" dur="6.96">mean when trey Gowdy was hitting call me</text>
  <text start="407.639" dur="4.471">with question after question about don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="411.03" dur="3.3">you think that you should be</text>
  <text start="412.11" dur="4.32">investigating who did the unmasking</text>
  <text start="414.33" dur="4.559">because there was a crime that was</text>
  <text start="416.43" dur="4.049">committed and you could see nothing was</text>
  <text start="418.889" dur="2.041">even done it mean Comey wasn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="420.479" dur="3.601">fazed</text>
  <text start="420.93" dur="5.459">but Trump did come out with a tweet</text>
  <text start="424.08" dur="4.86">where he said ask Sally Yates under oath</text>
  <text start="426.389" dur="5.28">if she knows how classified information</text>
  <text start="428.94" dur="5.43">got into the newspaper soon after she</text>
  <text start="431.669" dur="5.97">explained it to the White House Counsel</text>
  <text start="434.37" dur="5.31">which is again against the law now of</text>
  <text start="437.639" dur="4.051">course if this question was asked she</text>
  <text start="439.68" dur="3.66">would say well that&amp;#39;s classified and</text>
  <text start="441.69" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s how she would cover the whole</text>
  <text start="443.34" dur="3.48">thing up but instead of speaking to</text>
  <text start="445.47" dur="4.56">these individuals I can&amp;#39;t give them any</text>
  <text start="446.82" dur="5.7">information go right ahead and find the</text>
  <text start="450.03" dur="4.18">paperwork get a warrants amazing how</text>
  <text start="452.52" dur="3.82">they can get a warrant for</text>
  <text start="454.21" dur="4.98">everything else actually they can get a</text>
  <text start="456.34" dur="4.77">FISA warrant to spy on the Russians who</text>
  <text start="459.19" dur="3.99">actually was here in the United States</text>
  <text start="461.11" dur="6.209">it was amazing how they were able to</text>
  <text start="463.18" dur="7.169">unmask a u.s. citizen but nobody can</text>
  <text start="467.319" dur="5.78">figure out and go and follow the</text>
  <text start="470.349" dur="5.701">paperwork during a normal investigation</text>
  <text start="473.099" dur="5.651">that&amp;#39;s because they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="476.05" dur="5.25">information to get out there because it</text>
  <text start="478.75" dur="5.46">would be a scandal on top of a scandal</text>
  <text start="481.3" dur="5.04">now out in Venezuela we can see that the</text>
  <text start="484.21" dur="4.11">rioting the protests they are continuing</text>
  <text start="486.34" dur="4.02">and we know that the United States</text>

  <text start="674.14" dur="5.76">the BRIC system now out in North Korea</text>
  <text start="677.47" dur="3.84">and South Korea well in South Korea we</text>
  <text start="679.9" dur="3.39">understand the elections are coming up</text>
  <text start="681.31" dur="5.52">on May 9th and we&amp;#39;re getting word that</text>

  <text start="686.83" dur="5.28">now he&amp;#39;s in the lead but we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="689.11" dur="5.43">word that the deep state the central</text>
  <text start="692.11" dur="5.37">bank they might do something to make</text>
  <text start="694.54" dur="4.62">sure that he doesn&amp;#39;t win and we will</text>
  <text start="697.48" dur="3.9">have to see how this all plays out</text>
  <text start="699.16" dur="5.63">because we know the deep state doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="701.38" dur="5.64">want a president in there who&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="704.79" dur="3.64">work with North Korea who&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="707.02" dur="4.259">have a dialogue with North Korea because</text>
  <text start="708.43" dur="5.94">this will basically ruin all of their</text>
  <text start="711.279" dur="7.651">plans and this will not be good for them</text>
  <text start="714.37" dur="6.6">now out in France we know that macron he</text>
  <text start="718.93" dur="3.42">just won the elections in France now</text>
  <text start="720.97" dur="4.29">this was a paper</text>
  <text start="722.35" dur="5.63">but it was in a clear box but there are</text>
  <text start="725.26" dur="5.13">rumors that something was happening in</text>
  <text start="727.98" dur="4.99">certain areas but it doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="730.39" dur="5.13">matter anymore because they got the</text>
  <text start="732.97" dur="5.01">banker in there and he&amp;#39;s going to do</text>
  <text start="735.52" dur="5.19">everything that Hollande has done which</text>
  <text start="737.98" dur="5.1">means that nothing is going to get done</text>
  <text start="740.71" dur="5.28">and the bankers once again have full</text>
  <text start="743.08" dur="4.8">control of the entire country and of</text>
  <text start="745.99" dur="4.95">course micron is going to stay with the</text>
  <text start="747.88" dur="4.74">EU he wants immigration he wants</text>
  <text start="750.94" dur="4.5">everything opposite of what the pen was</text>
  <text start="752.62" dur="5.19">for and we can see right now that this</text>
  <text start="755.44" dur="4.29">is not going to help the EU the system</text>
  <text start="757.81" dur="4.32">is going to collapse on its own while</text>
  <text start="759.73" dur="6.12">the EU is holding the reins because we</text>
  <text start="762.13" dur="6.09">can see out in the EU out in the United</text>
  <text start="765.85" dur="5.31">States and around the world that the</text>
  <text start="768.22" dur="5.64">system the global debt guess what it</text>
  <text start="771.16" dur="5.13">cannot be sustained this whole system is</text>
  <text start="773.86" dur="4.38">about to implode and they know it and</text>
  <text start="776.29" dur="3.27">the whole thing is going to go down</text>
  <text start="778.24" dur="3.99">around them now they have to get their</text>
  <text start="779.56" dur="4.17">narrative straight to explain away why</text>
  <text start="782.23" dur="3.51">all this happening this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="783.73" dur="3.21">trying to push for war this is why</text>
  <text start="785.74" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re trying to point the fingers at</text>
  <text start="786.94" dur="5.04">other areas because they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="789.43" dur="6.18">be blamed for all of this now we see</text>
  <text start="791.98" dur="8.07">Saudi Arabia they are now basically</text>
  <text start="795.61" dur="7.08">picking a fight with Iran and the Saudi</text>
  <text start="800.05" dur="5.73">Arabia Kingdom deputy Crown Prince</text>
  <text start="802.69" dur="4.98">Mohammed bin Salman the man who is now</text>
  <text start="805.78" dur="4.98">effectively in charge of Saudi oil</text>
  <text start="807.67" dur="5.88">policy ruled out any dialogue with Iran</text>
  <text start="810.76" dur="4.68">and pledged to protect his conservative</text>
  <text start="813.55" dur="5.13">kingdom from what he called to rands</text>
  <text start="815.44" dur="6.48">efforts to dominate the Muslim world he</text>
  <text start="818.68" dur="6.57">said we know that we are a main goal for</text>
  <text start="821.92" dur="5.25">the Iranian regime we will not wait</text>
  <text start="825.25" dur="4.38">until the battle comes to Saudi Arabia</text>
  <text start="827.17" dur="6">but we will work to have the battle in</text>
  <text start="829.63" dur="5.28">Iran rather in Saudi Arabia now we see</text>
  <text start="833.17" dur="3.21">what&amp;#39;s happening right now things are</text>
  <text start="834.91" dur="4.5">going wrong for the deep state in this</text>
  <text start="836.38" dur="5.49">area it&amp;#39;s going wrong in Syria in many</text>
  <text start="839.41" dur="4.92">of the other countries Saudi Arabia was</text>
  <text start="841.87" dur="5.31">behind a lot of the terrorist groups</text>
  <text start="844.33" dur="4.8">along with Qatar Bahrain and many of the</text>
  <text start="847.18" dur="5.88">other countries and they are losing</text>
  <text start="849.13" dur="5.73">their grip on all of these countries so</text>
  <text start="853.06" dur="3.07">what they&amp;#39;re going to do and remember</text>
  <text start="854.86" dur="4.18">this was all part of the plan</text>
  <text start="856.13" dur="5.1">is was to get into Iran and at this</text>
  <text start="859.04" dur="4.95">point they see no way out most likely</text>
  <text start="861.23" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re going to try to to kick up some</text>
  <text start="863.99" dur="4.71">type of war now they tried it in Syria</text>
  <text start="866.24" dur="4.17">did not work with the Russians did not</text>
  <text start="868.7" dur="4.29">work they tried it in North Korea and</text>
  <text start="870.41" dur="4.02">that is not going as planned we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="872.99" dur="3.48">to see how the elections turn out in May</text>
  <text start="874.43" dur="4.17">ninth so now they&amp;#39;re trying to kick it</text>
  <text start="876.47" dur="4.32">up with Iran where we have the USS</text>
  <text start="878.6" dur="4.35">George W Bush that aircraft carrier</text>
  <text start="880.79" dur="4.29">sitting outside of Iran provoking them</text>
  <text start="882.95" dur="4.38">there and we can see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="885.08" dur="4.35">continually pushing Iran and Saudi</text>
  <text start="887.33" dur="3.33">Arabia has just made this huge push so</text>
  <text start="889.43" dur="4.41">we could see what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="890.66" dur="5.55">in the meantime out in Syria we see that</text>
  <text start="893.84" dur="5.58">safe zones they are holding and very</text>
  <text start="896.21" dur="5.31">interestingly violence in these areas</text>
  <text start="899.42" dur="4.44">have dropped significantly are they</text>
  <text start="901.52" dur="4.44">completely disappeared no but they have</text>
  <text start="903.86" dur="4.86">dropped significantly and right now</text>
  <text start="905.96" dur="5.7">Syria saying we do not want UN monitors</text>
  <text start="908.72" dur="6.03">or any foreign force to monitor these</text>
  <text start="911.66" dur="4.77">areas we will do it Russia will do it we</text>
  <text start="914.75" dur="2.91">don&amp;#39;t need any outside help right now</text>
  <text start="916.43" dur="2.85">and actually which i think is a good</text>
  <text start="917.66" dur="4.56">thing they should monitor their own</text>
  <text start="919.28" dur="6.32">areas it is their country and we can see</text>
  <text start="922.22" dur="5.64">even though the UN and United States is</text>
  <text start="925.6" dur="4.21">continually out there saying that Assad</text>
  <text start="927.86" dur="4.41">is killing his own people gassing his</text>
  <text start="929.81" dur="3.75">own people even though all the chemical</text>
  <text start="932.27" dur="3.09">weapons have been removed from the</text>
  <text start="933.56" dur="3.96">country the United States signed off on</text>
  <text start="935.36" dur="5.46">it Russia signed off on it the UN signed</text>
  <text start="937.52" dur="6.15">off on it and the only group that we</text>
  <text start="940.82" dur="6.57">know that had chemical weapons were the</text>
  <text start="943.67" dur="5.67">terrorists which were paid for by the</text>
  <text start="947.39" dur="4.71">United States government the coalition</text>
  <text start="949.34" dur="6.66">forces Israel and the rest they were</text>
  <text start="952.1" dur="5.85">supported by all of them and they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="956" dur="3.69">ones who had the chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="957.95" dur="3.74">they&amp;#39;re the ones who used the chemical</text>
  <text start="959.69" dur="4.62">weapons and we can see right now that</text>
  <text start="961.69" dur="5.38">the Russian US relations</text>
  <text start="964.31" dur="4.8">well Lavrov and Tillerson they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="967.07" dur="4.62">to try to iron these out along with</text>
  <text start="969.11" dur="6.42">Syria and other areas they&amp;#39;re meeting in</text>
  <text start="971.69" dur="5.13">Washington DC on May 10th and to be</text>
  <text start="975.53" dur="3.48">talking about all the situations that</text>
  <text start="976.82" dur="4.41">are going on right now so we&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="979.01" dur="5.16">see how that plays out now we understand</text>
  <text start="981.23" dur="4.95">that there is a multiple films going on</text>
  <text start="984.17" dur="5.08">in Syria about these chemical attacks</text>
  <text start="986.18" dur="5.59">which is very interesting in itself but</text>
  <text start="989.25" dur="3.9">we also realize that there are rumors</text>
  <text start="991.77" dur="4.83">that something is being planned in</text>
  <text start="993.15" dur="6.12">Jordan and right now we have this drill</text>
  <text start="996.6" dur="6.18">this military exercise out in Jordan ow</text>
  <text start="999.27" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;ve seen this before during the spring</text>
  <text start="1002.78" dur="4.44">and summer months leading up until</text>
  <text start="1004.61" dur="4.86">August where they had eager lion a</text>
  <text start="1007.22" dur="5.99">military exercise where they brought in</text>
  <text start="1009.47" dur="6.72">a huge number of troops a huge number of</text>
  <text start="1013.21" dur="5.08">military assets and they would leave it</text>
  <text start="1016.19" dur="5.78">in Jordan because they would use it</text>
  <text start="1018.29" dur="6.419">later for the invasion into Syria and</text>
  <text start="1021.97" dur="6.13">what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is the same</text>
  <text start="1024.709" dur="5.61">thing happening now there are seven</text>
  <text start="1028.1" dur="4.92">thousand four hundred troops from 20</text>
  <text start="1030.319" dur="4.831">different nations taking part in eager</text>
  <text start="1033.02" dur="5.61">lion military drills is the largest and</text>
  <text start="1035.15" dur="5.669">most complex to date now Jordan and the</text>
  <text start="1038.63" dur="4.92">United States kicked off eager lion this</text>
  <text start="1040.819" dur="6.061">Sunday and this is an annual military</text>
  <text start="1043.55" dur="5.85">exercise and it takes part pretty much</text>
  <text start="1046.88" dur="5.1">every year and we&amp;#39;ve seen this before</text>
  <text start="1049.4" dur="5.85">where every time they have this drill</text>
  <text start="1051.98" dur="7.23">something happens during the month of</text>
  <text start="1055.25" dur="5.1">July to August now this time we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1059.21" dur="3.48">getting word that something might happen</text>
  <text start="1060.35" dur="4.2">June 1st but what&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1062.69" dur="5.1">about all this is that they were</text>
  <text start="1064.55" dur="6.12">preparing films about different areas</text>
  <text start="1067.79" dur="5.4">getting hit with chemical attacks so</text>
  <text start="1070.67" dur="5.1">when we put all this together we can see</text>
  <text start="1073.19" dur="6.27">that this might be a plan for their last</text>
  <text start="1075.77" dur="5.73">attempt to get into Syria now the</text>
  <text start="1079.46" dur="5.82">highlight of this year&amp;#39;s war game is</text>
  <text start="1081.5" dur="6.72">that for the first time ever a Global</text>
  <text start="1085.28" dur="8.58">Strike mission will be conducted by two</text>
  <text start="1088.22" dur="8.37">US Force b-1b bomber aircraft these are</text>
  <text start="1093.86" dur="5.49">long rage multi mission bombers again</text>
  <text start="1096.59" dur="6.66">very interesting because these can be</text>
  <text start="1099.35" dur="7.05">used to bomb all of these areas and to</text>
  <text start="1103.25" dur="7.14">go after Assad and we know that the deep</text>
  <text start="1106.4" dur="6.81">state they have been pushing to get into</text>
  <text start="1110.39" dur="6.12">Syria for a very long time they never</text>
  <text start="1113.21" dur="6.12">give up on their goal they always come</text>
  <text start="1116.51" dur="4.919">around and find another way to get war</text>
  <text start="1119.33" dur="3.6">started and what we&amp;#39;re looking at right</text>
  <text start="1121.429" dur="4.191">now is</text>
  <text start="1122.93" dur="6.75">three different hot points one in Syria</text>
  <text start="1125.62" dur="7.72">now Iran and North Korea and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1129.68" dur="6.24">trying their best to try to get a</text>
  <text start="1133.34" dur="5.16">conflict started between the United</text>
  <text start="1135.92" dur="5.49">States and these countries because they</text>
  <text start="1138.5" dur="6.18">need the conflict to cover up this</text>
  <text start="1141.41" dur="6.36">entire economic collapse they need this</text>
  <text start="1144.68" dur="6.81">conflict because everyone will forget</text>
  <text start="1147.77" dur="5.76">everything because war would be</text>
  <text start="1151.49" dur="4.71">happening at this point in time and</text>
  <text start="1153.53" dur="4.68">people forget when there&amp;#39;s a huge event</text>
  <text start="1156.2" dur="4.26">or something big happens everyone</text>
  <text start="1158.21" dur="5.1">forgets everything else and all they</text>
  <text start="1160.46" dur="4.83">concentrate on is what is happening</text>
  <text start="1163.31" dur="5.16">right here and now and when the war is</text>
  <text start="1165.29" dur="6.33">over nobody remembers to go back in time</text>
