  <text start="147.69" dur="4.11">we can see how this is all playing out</text>
  <text start="149.55" dur="4.23">now if we go throughout the world and we</text>
  <text start="151.8" dur="5.31">see what&amp;#39;s happening there most of the</text>
  <text start="153.78" dur="6">economies are starting to really decline</text>
  <text start="157.11" dur="5.07">enter Avery session move into a</text>
  <text start="159.78" dur="4.319">depression and we see this happening</text>
  <text start="162.18" dur="3.119">throughout Europe we definitely know</text>
  <text start="164.099" dur="3.661">what&amp;#39;s happening in the United States</text>
  <text start="165.299" dur="6.33">but it is all being covered up with</text>
  <text start="167.76" dur="6.059">manipulated statistical numbers and we</text>
  <text start="171.629" dur="4.591">understand that these numbers are</text>
  <text start="173.819" dur="5.361">manipulated but if we go out to the</text>
  <text start="176.22" dur="6.48">Netherlands we understand now that SP</text>
  <text start="179.18" dur="6.13">has lost their credit rating Standard &amp;amp;</text>
  <text start="182.7" dur="4.379">Poor&amp;#39;s what they decided to do is strip</text>
  <text start="185.31" dur="3.81">the Netherlands of their triple-a credit</text>
  <text start="187.079" dur="4.05">rating and they&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="189.12" dur="3.99">country&amp;#39;s growth prospects of the Turk</text>
  <text start="191.129" dur="5.371">deteriorate &amp;#39;add and it is not</text>
  <text start="193.11" dur="5.76">performing as well as its peers and we</text>
  <text start="196.5" dur="5.34">also see what&amp;#39;s happening in the bank in</text>
  <text start="198.87" dur="5.729">the UK the Bank of England said holy we</text>
  <text start="201.84" dur="5.04">see this a housing bubble starting to</text>
  <text start="204.599" dur="4.801">form and the Bank of England right now</text>
  <text start="206.88" dur="5.22">has decided to stop the controversial</text>
  <text start="209.4" dur="4.919">mortgage support program because they</text>
  <text start="212.1" dur="6.12">fear that a new housing bubble is</text>
  <text start="214.319" dur="6.931">starting to appear and what this means</text>
  <text start="218.22" dur="5.22">now is that it will make it much more</text>
  <text start="221.25" dur="5.7">difficult for average borrowers and</text>
  <text start="223.44" dur="5.639">people who who really can&amp;#39;t get approved</text>
  <text start="226.95" dur="5.73">for mortgages for homes will no longer</text>
  <text start="229.079" dur="7.41">be able to purchase a home and this will</text>
  <text start="232.68" dur="5.82">slow down the bubble but again this was</text>
  <text start="236.489" dur="4.771">this will also have an effect on their</text>
  <text start="238.5" dur="4.98">economy because the housing market will</text>
  <text start="241.26" dur="4.74">start to decline and this is what they</text>
  <text start="243.48" dur="6.08">were trying to pump up here in the US</text>
  <text start="246" dur="7.139">what we are seeing is the housing market</text>
  <text start="249.56" dur="5.95">bubble forming they&amp;#39;re giving everyone</text>
  <text start="253.139" dur="3.871">alone it doesn&amp;#39;t matter who you are and</text>
  <text start="255.51" dur="6.12">it&amp;#39;s funny because I was just where I</text>
  <text start="257.01" dur="6.36">was I saw my my cousins just purchased a</text>
  <text start="261.63" dur="4.02">new house and the only reason they were</text>
  <text start="263.37" dur="4.669">able to purchase a new house because</text>
  <text start="265.65" dur="5.67">they&amp;#39;re giving one hundred percent</text>
  <text start="268.039" dur="6.501">financing and they were able to move in</text>
  <text start="271.32" dur="7.63">with absolutely no money</text>
  <text start="274.54" dur="8.97">and we understand we saw this happen</text>
  <text start="278.95" dur="7.89">back in 2007-2008 now the European</text>
  <text start="283.51" dur="6.36">unemployment went from 12.2 percent to</text>
  <text start="286.84" dur="6.51">12.1 percent and during the summer a one</text>
  <text start="289.87" dur="5.22">from 12.1 percent to 12.0 percent and</text>
  <text start="293.35" dur="3.93">they realize they made a miscalculation</text>
  <text start="295.09" dur="4.71">and it went up to 12 point two percent</text>
  <text start="297.28" dur="4.74">and I assure you now that they have</text>
  <text start="299.8" dur="4.53">manipulated the numbers to show that</text>
  <text start="302.02" dur="4.77">unemployment is getting better but if</text>
  <text start="304.33" dur="3.92">you look at the youth unemployment we</text>
  <text start="306.79" dur="3.84">are seeing the youth unemployment</text>
  <text start="308.25" dur="5.5">skyrocket to twenty four point four</text>
  <text start="310.63" dur="6.39">percent among the European nations and</text>
  <text start="313.75" dur="5.73">if we look closer we&amp;#39;ve seen we see</text>
  <text start="317.02" dur="6.03">Spain now with a youth unemployment</text>
  <text start="319.48" dur="6.75">around fifty seven point four percent</text>
  <text start="323.05" dur="7.26">Greece is approaching sixty percent</text>
  <text start="326.23" dur="8.61">right now so this is not getting better</text>
  <text start="330.31" dur="6.69">it is getting worse and in my past</text>
  <text start="334.84" dur="4.92">reports I&amp;#39;ve always mentioned that the</text>
  <text start="337" dur="4.86">US government has this huge amount of</text>
  <text start="339.76" dur="3.84">debt that cannot be sustained and this</text>
  <text start="341.86" dur="3.66">is why they&amp;#39;re implementing fact that</text>
  <text start="343.6" dur="3.9">this is why they&amp;#39;re looking across the</text>
  <text start="345.52" dur="4.89">pond here looking for those who are</text>
  <text start="347.5" dur="5.88">making an income in Europe in other</text>
  <text start="350.41" dur="4.68">countries in the European nations and</text>
  <text start="353.38" dur="4.92">other countries outside the European</text>
  <text start="355.09" dur="5.85">nations they are looking to find those</text>
  <text start="358.3" dur="4.95">people who have a United States passport</text>
  <text start="360.94" dur="4.74">but are no longer in the country but</text>
  <text start="363.25" dur="4.56">working outside the country they want to</text>
  <text start="365.68" dur="5.64">tax them and they are looking for money</text>
  <text start="367.81" dur="5.76">anywhere anyway any and trying to get it</text>
  <text start="371.32" dur="4.62">anyway they possibly can why because</text>
  <text start="373.57" dur="5.13">they need the revenue to sustain the</text>
  <text start="375.94" dur="4.98">debt so right now the Swiss bank is</text>
  <text start="378.7" dur="4.38">clear to take part in the US tax deal</text>
  <text start="380.92" dur="5.06">the Swiss government says it has cleared</text>
  <text start="383.08" dur="6.15">the first batch of banks to cooperate</text>
  <text start="385.98" dur="7.99">with the US authorities under a deal to</text>
  <text start="389.23" dur="7.11">stern tax to stem tax evasion and this</text>
  <text start="393.97" dur="4.95">is what is happening right now the</text>
  <text start="396.34" dur="4.59">United States will be going after every</text>
  <text start="398.92" dur="5.28">single person who&amp;#39;s trying to hide money</text>
  <text start="400.93" dur="6">or have money overseas and they will</text>
  <text start="404.2" dur="4">have to prove that they&amp;#39;ve already paid</text>
  <text start="406.93" dur="5.26">taxes on this</text>
  <text start="408.2" dur="8.16">and the banks will be turning in all of</text>
  <text start="412.19" dur="7.62">these people now I have always talked</text>
  <text start="416.36" dur="6.21">about real estate and you know real</text>
  <text start="419.81" dur="5.43">estate is in a decline we see more jicka</text>
  <text start="422.57" dur="6.24">applications plunging we see pending</text>
  <text start="425.24" dur="6.09">sales starting to decline right now new</text>
  <text start="428.81" dur="5.19">home builders are seeing cancellations</text>
  <text start="431.33" dur="4.74">foot traffic is getting much slower not</text>
  <text start="434" dur="5.25">as many people coming to look at the</text>
  <text start="436.07" dur="5.46">homes and we understand that Wells Fargo</text>
  <text start="439.25" dur="4.59">Citibank Bank of America chase they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="441.53" dur="4.32">all laying off thousands of people from</text>
  <text start="443.84" dur="6.69">their mortgage division and guess what</text>
  <text start="445.85" dur="6.42">the Fed has not stopped buying the toxic</text>
  <text start="450.53" dur="4.26">real estate from banks right now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="452.27" dur="3.99">pumping in 40 to 45 billion just in</text>
  <text start="454.79" dur="4.08">toxic real estate and then you have</text>
  <text start="456.26" dur="4.71">another 40 45 billion going into</text>
  <text start="458.87" dur="3.81">Treasury bonds because the foreign</text>
  <text start="460.97" dur="3.54">nations are selling their bonds and</text>
  <text start="462.68" dur="3.9">there has to be a buyer and the only</text>
  <text start="464.51" dur="4.59">buyer right now is the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="466.58" dur="5.28">because they can print money out of thin</text>
  <text start="469.1" dur="4.32">air and buy these bonds and this is why</text>
  <text start="471.86" dur="2.73">this is happening and the Fed has</text>
  <text start="473.42" dur="3.66">already been out there saying that</text>
  <text start="474.59" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;d like to increase the amount of QE</text>
  <text start="477.08" dur="4.29">by fifty percent which I believe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="479.24" dur="3.57">going to be a lot more because what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="481.37" dur="3.75">going to happen and China already</text>
  <text start="482.81" dur="5.52">signaled that this is happening right</text>
  <text start="485.12" dur="6.09">now other foreign nations will no longer</text>
  <text start="488.33" dur="6.18">buy Treasury bonds they will start</text>
  <text start="491.21" dur="7.05">selling them as the economy as realist</text>
  <text start="494.51" dur="8.07">art starts at the klein we will see the</text>
  <text start="498.26" dur="6.27">Fed needing to purchase a lot more real</text>
  <text start="502.58" dur="4.11">estate from the banks because there&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="504.53" dur="3.9">be a lot more foreclosures and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="506.69" dur="4.47">going to see the job market decline</text>
  <text start="508.43" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;re going to see retail sales decline</text>
  <text start="511.16" dur="4.89">and we&amp;#39;re going to see of course the</text>
  <text start="513.68" dur="4.35">real estate market really starts decline</text>
  <text start="516.05" dur="5.67">because once those hedge funds</text>
  <text start="518.03" dur="5.13">investment companies start dumping the</text>
  <text start="521.72" dur="4.2">real estate and they&amp;#39;ve started already</text>
  <text start="523.16" dur="6.3">because in california what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="525.92" dur="7.53">right now cash buyers are slowly pulling</text>
  <text start="529.46" dur="6.51">back in california they are starting to</text>
  <text start="533.45" dur="5.61">dump the real estate they&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="535.97" dur="6">slowdown in the amount of cash purchases</text>
  <text start="539.06" dur="5.879">the amount of mortgage</text>
  <text start="541.97" dur="6.419">applications are plunging incredibly</text>
  <text start="544.939" dur="7.14">fast in California and right now if we</text>
  <text start="548.389" dur="6">go back in time in February of 2013 they</text>
  <text start="552.079" dur="5.37">saw about thirty six point nine percent</text>
  <text start="554.389" dur="5.791">of the homes being purchased in</text>
  <text start="557.449" dur="6">California where cash in September it</text>
  <text start="560.18" dur="5.519">dropped a 28.5 percent and now in</text>
  <text start="563.449" dur="4.531">October its twenty seven point five</text>
  <text start="565.699" dur="5.161">percent and what we are seeing are these</text>
  <text start="567.98" dur="6.33">cash buyers are now trying to unload</text>
  <text start="570.86" dur="7.229">these houses and the reason for this is</text>
  <text start="574.31" dur="5.819">because the bubble is reaching the top</text>
  <text start="578.089" dur="4.321">and what happens is the people who have</text>
  <text start="580.129" dur="4.471">inflated the bubble are trying to get</text>
  <text start="582.41" dur="6.299">out of the market and trying to give it</text>
  <text start="584.6" dur="7.32">to the the everyday person who&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="588.709" dur="5.971">to purchase a new home purchase a home</text>
  <text start="591.92" dur="4.62">for investment purposes flip a home and</text>
  <text start="594.68" dur="6.659">it&amp;#39;s funny on the radio I just heard</text>
  <text start="596.54" dur="7.26">someone from HGTV having a seminar that</text>
  <text start="601.339" dur="6.151">this is the perfect time to get in and</text>
  <text start="603.8" dur="7.62">to start flipping homes and this is what</text>
  <text start="607.49" dur="6.36">happened in 2007 the flipping of the</text>
  <text start="611.42" dur="5.49">homes was at the height of the market</text>
  <text start="613.85" dur="6">and we are seeing the same exact thing</text>
  <text start="616.91" dur="5.039">happen right now the main investors who</text>
  <text start="619.85" dur="4.229">pumped up the market are dumping the</text>
  <text start="621.949" dur="3.93">homes the other people who believe that</text>
  <text start="624.079" dur="3.841">the market is the housing market is just</text>
  <text start="625.879" dur="4.95">going to keep going up are now getting</text>

  <text start="633.709" dur="5.49">people who are buying homes for the</text>
  <text start="636.019" dur="6.36">first time will be holding these homes</text>
  <text start="639.199" dur="6.301">at the highest prices as the market</text>
  <text start="642.379" dur="5.671">declines and crashes it is the same</text>
  <text start="645.5" dur="5.37">exact thing the only difference this</text>
  <text start="648.05" dur="4.8">time is that the last time thirty-eight</text>
  <text start="650.87" dur="5.61">percent of the american people lost</text>
  <text start="652.85" dur="5.969">their wealth we have a tremendous shadow</text>
  <text start="656.48" dur="4.5">inventory on the banks books that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="658.819" dur="4.95">where the fed is continually gobbling up</text>
  <text start="660.98" dur="7.049">all the toxic real estate and right now</text>
  <text start="663.769" dur="6.601">unemployment is around thirty percent if</text>
  <text start="668.029" dur="6.211">you use the calculation I talked about</text>
  <text start="670.37" dur="5.49">that that someone did in my past report</text>
  <text start="674.24" dur="4.98">and if you use the shadows</text>
  <text start="675.86" dur="5.58">that&amp;#39;s calculation going back prior to</text>
  <text start="679.22" dur="4.29">nineteen ninety four unemployment is</text>
  <text start="681.44" dur="5.03">around 19 is around twenty-four</text>
  <text start="683.51" dur="5.88">twenty-five percent underemployment is</text>
  <text start="686.47" dur="4.6">dramatically high because those people</text>
  <text start="689.39" dur="3.84">who lost their full-time job of working</text>
  <text start="691.07" dur="5.009">part-time job and most of the people</text>
  <text start="693.23" dur="5.19">that lost their houses have bad credit</text>
  <text start="696.079" dur="6.661">so they cannot purchase another house so</text>
  <text start="698.42" dur="6.87">here we are with the next wave of real</text>
  <text start="702.74" dur="5.13">estate completely crashing and it is</text>
  <text start="705.29" dur="5.31">going to crash hard this time because</text>
  <text start="707.87" dur="4.95">last time there were no shadow</text>
  <text start="710.6" dur="4.859">inventories we didn&amp;#39;t have the Fed</text>
  <text start="712.82" dur="5.34">pumping in forty billion dollars every</text>
  <text start="715.459" dur="5.25">single month to buy this real estate so</text>
  <text start="718.16" dur="5.299">this time it is going to be a lot worse</text>
  <text start="720.709" dur="5.341">and I said this in my past reports</text>
  <text start="723.459" dur="5.351">everyone talking about unemployment</text>
  <text start="726.05" dur="4.62">going down we&amp;#39;re at 7.3 percent it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="728.81" dur="3.69">even getting better they see it you know</text>
  <text start="730.67" dur="5.099">thanks getting better and I said this a</text>
  <text start="732.5" dur="5.91">year ago unemployment was higher so that</text>
  <text start="735.769" dur="4.231">means retail should have been worse</text>
  <text start="738.41" dur="4.32">because there are a lot less people</text>
  <text start="740" dur="4.949">working and what we are seeing right now</text>
  <text start="742.73" dur="5.37">there are some numbers trickling in from</text>
  <text start="744.949" dur="5.25">black friday now of course stores opened</text>
  <text start="748.1" dur="4.919">early on Thursday and well I thought</text>
  <text start="750.199" dur="5.551">that all that did was redistribute the</text>
  <text start="753.019" dur="5.781">people who went out to try to find these</text>
  <text start="755.75" dur="7.47">deals that they were talking about and</text>
  <text start="758.8" dur="8.14">right now the US consumers spent about</text>
  <text start="763.22" dur="10.109">fifty 7.4 billion over black friday</text>
  <text start="766.94" dur="9.81">weekend and this time last year the</text>
  <text start="773.329" dur="7.581">American people spent fifty 9.1 billion</text>
  <text start="776.75" dur="9.99">so already we are down two billion</text>
  <text start="780.91" dur="9.549">dollars so we can see how this doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="786.74" dur="5.55">fit into the US government&amp;#39;s model the</text>
  <text start="790.459" dur="3.69">unemployment right now because you have</text>
  <text start="792.29" dur="5.07">to remember President Obama was getting</text>
  <text start="794.149" dur="5.581">elected in 2012 and they were saying</text>
  <text start="797.36" dur="6.87">that unemployment dropped from eight</text>
  <text start="799.73" dur="6.089">percent 27.8 eight percent back then</text>
  <text start="804.23" dur="3.599">you&amp;#39;re going into the Christmas even</text>
  <text start="805.819" dur="3.871">season so we had seven point eight</text>
  <text start="807.829" dur="4.201">percent now they&amp;#39;re telling us that</text>
  <text start="809.69" dur="4.56">I mean is at 7.3 percent but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="812.03" dur="5.79">also trying to tell us that more people</text>
  <text start="814.25" dur="7.29">are working they have jobs but retail is</text>
  <text start="817.82" dur="6.45">a lot less hmm very interesting so what</text>
  <text start="821.54" dur="5.84">does that really tell us well the number</text>
  <text start="824.27" dur="5.85">of part-time jobs has increased the</text>
  <text start="827.38" dur="4.6">salaries haven&amp;#39;t increased the amount of</text>
  <text start="830.12" dur="4.23">money people are making hasn&amp;#39;t increased</text>
  <text start="831.98" dur="6.03">so what are we seeing just like we</text>
  <text start="834.35" dur="8.1">expected to see the fake manipulated</text>
  <text start="838.01" dur="8.01">numbers are are just that manipulated</text>
  <text start="842.45" dur="7.47">and fake the part-time numbered numbers</text>
  <text start="846.02" dur="6.87">are much higher salaries have gone down</text>
  <text start="849.92" dur="6.06">unemployment is skyrocketing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="852.89" dur="6.18">seeing two billion dollars less already</text>
  <text start="855.98" dur="5.25">during the black friday sales and the</text>
  <text start="859.07" dur="5.67">National Retail foundation expected</text>
  <text start="861.23" dur="7.29">sales to be around three point nine</text>
  <text start="864.74" dur="6.03">percent which would be about 602 billion</text>
  <text start="868.52" dur="5.7">for the season and this is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="870.77" dur="6">expecting and guess what this is not</text>
  <text start="874.22" dur="6.09">what&amp;#39;s going to happen already they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="876.77" dur="6.24">on the path of being forty percent below</text>
  <text start="880.31" dur="5.64">what they thought they were going to hit</text>
  <text start="883.01" dur="5.97">so this holiday season and we have this</text>
  <text start="885.95" dur="4.26">reported before they all the retail</text>
  <text start="888.98" dur="2.82">stores of course they&amp;#39;re going to blame</text>
  <text start="890.21" dur="2.97">this on the weather they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="891.8" dur="5.16">blame this on so many different things</text>
  <text start="893.18" dur="6.99">but in reality what is going to happen</text>
  <text start="896.96" dur="5.37">is the holiday season is going to be a</text>
  <text start="900.17" dur="4.23">lot worse and they&amp;#39;ll probably end up</text>
  <text start="902.33" dur="4.65">manipulating some numbers here and there</text>
  <text start="904.4" dur="4.62">and you&amp;#39;re going to see a lot of stores</text>
  <text start="906.98" dur="5.04">start to close you&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="909.02" dur="5.46">blowout sales you&amp;#39;re going to see a lot</text>
  <text start="912.02" dur="6.81">of layoffs and you&amp;#39;re going to see a lot</text>
  <text start="914.48" dur="6.66">of space in the retail market come this</text>
  <text start="918.83" dur="5.73">spring because they will not be able to</text>
  <text start="921.14" dur="7.14">sustain having all these stores open and</text>
  <text start="924.56" dur="11.13">we saw this happen last year in February</text>
