  <text start="728.97" dur="3.96">they thought were only going to write</text>
  <text start="730.35" dur="5.37">rise by seven point five percent in 2016</text>
  <text start="732.93" dur="6.87">well it looks like it&amp;#39;s going to be much</text>
  <text start="735.72" dur="6.239">much worse right now coming from an</text>
  <text start="739.8" dur="5.07">analysis by The Daily Caller news</text>
  <text start="741.959" dur="5.101">foundation they&amp;#39;re finding out that</text>
  <text start="744.87" dur="6.089">premiums are going to be around 20 point</text>
  <text start="747.06" dur="6.12">three percent in 2016 why is this</text>
  <text start="750.959" dur="4.44">because there was a discrepancy on how</text>
  <text start="753.18" dur="5.339">the government calculated this they</text>
  <text start="755.399" dur="5.791">excluded price data for three of the</text>
  <text start="758.519" dur="5.25">four obamacare health insurance plans</text>
  <text start="761.19" dur="4.62">when the officials issued their recent</text>
  <text start="763.769" dur="4.021">forecasts claiming enrollees would face</text>
  <text start="765.81" dur="6.12">only a seven point five percent increase</text>
  <text start="767.79" dur="7.289">because they left some of the health</text>
  <text start="771.93" dur="5.43">plans out of the calculation it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="775.079" dur="6.26">amazing how they manipulate all their</text>
  <text start="777.36" dur="7.8">calculations now as time goes on</text>
  <text start="781.339" dur="7.06">Obamacare is getting worse and worse I</text>
  <text start="785.16" dur="7.83">mean two weeks ago we know that Colorado</text>
  <text start="788.399" dur="8.31">their co-op folded 80,000 people in</text>
  <text start="792.99" dur="7.74">Colorado they don&amp;#39;t have insurance New</text>
  <text start="796.709" dur="6.141">York health Republic insurance basically</text>
  <text start="800.73" dur="5.039">is being brought up on charges for fraud</text>
  <text start="802.85" dur="5.32">bankruptcy and that&amp;#39;s about two hundred</text>
  <text start="805.769" dur="5.221">and fifteen thousand members right now</text>
  <text start="808.17" dur="6.229">out of all the coops and everything from</text>
  <text start="810.99" dur="7.62">Obamacare there is a forty six percent</text>
  <text start="814.399" dur="8.531">failure rate think about this I mean</text>
  <text start="818.61" dur="6.27">there are a total 10 coops all of which</text>
  <text start="822.93" dur="4.05">were created by the Affordable Care Act</text>
  <text start="824.88" dur="7.44">and seated with billions in federal</text>
  <text start="826.98" dur="10.71">funding and they&amp;#39;ve failed and this is</text>
  <text start="832.32" dur="8.4">laughs I mean this is not a system that</text>
  <text start="837.69" dur="5.7">is working because it is not a benefit</text>
  <text start="840.72" dur="5.28">to the people it was never meant for the</text>
  <text start="843.39" dur="5.85">people just like everything the</text>
  <text start="846" dur="5.43">government has been doing it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="849.24" dur="5.37">for themselves for corporations for</text>
  <text start="851.43" dur="5.85">central bankers it&amp;#39;s not a benefit to</text>
  <text start="854.61" dur="4.17">the people and we can see that there was</text>
  <text start="857.28" dur="5.37">an analysis done by the heritage</text>
  <text start="858.78" dur="5.4">foundation that the enrollment data for</text>
  <text start="862.65" dur="5.25">the private health insurance plans and</text>
  <text start="864.18" dur="5.22">public programs they found that 9.25</text>
  <text start="867.9" dur="4.2">million more Americans had health</text>
  <text start="869.4" dur="7.41">insurance coverage at the end of 2014 at</text>
  <text start="872.1" dur="8.34">the end of 2013 however where did all</text>
  <text start="876.81" dur="6.54">these people come from well the data</text>
  <text start="880.44" dur="7.23">also shows the Affordable Care Act which</text>
  <text start="883.35" dur="5.82">is Obamacare was all the members were</text>
  <text start="887.67" dur="5.19">brought in because of a Medicaid</text>
  <text start="889.17" dur="9.96">expansion this was this was responsible</text>
  <text start="892.86" dur="8.01">for the net increase in coverage so all</text>
  <text start="899.13" dur="3.63">the people that still don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="900.87" dur="3.81">insurance they still don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="902.76" dur="4.17">insurance and most of the people that</text>
  <text start="904.68" dur="4.14">were brought on to these plans they had</text>
  <text start="906.93" dur="4.17">insurance but actually what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="908.82" dur="4.92">now is they&amp;#39;re paying a lot more for</text>
  <text start="911.1" dur="5.7">that insurance so this is a complete</text>
  <text start="913.74" dur="5.46">disaster now we know the US government</text>
  <text start="916.8" dur="3.9">central bankers they need to find ways</text>
  <text start="919.2" dur="3.11">of bringing in more and more revenue</text>
  <text start="920.7" dur="4.95">because the debt is continually rising</text>
  <text start="922.31" dur="6.49">that is never going to end there is</text>
  <text start="925.65" dur="4.53">suppressing interest rates and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="928.8" dur="3.69">happening is because all their numbers</text>
  <text start="930.18" dur="3.54">are fake the people who are losing their</text>
  <text start="932.49" dur="2.55">jobs there are no logo bringing in</text>
  <text start="933.72" dur="3.54">revenue those people who find part-time</text>
  <text start="935.04" dur="4.53">jobs they&amp;#39;re bringing in maybe a half or</text>
  <text start="937.26" dur="4.65">a quarter of the revenue so this is why</text>
  <text start="939.57" dur="3.78">they came up with Obamacare faka and the</text>
  <text start="941.91" dur="4.02">last thing they&amp;#39;re looking for is a</text>
  <text start="943.35" dur="5.1">carbon tax because this they can tax</text>
  <text start="945.93" dur="3.99">everyone in the world and we know</text>
  <text start="948.45" dur="3.33">Christine Lagarde was out there saying</text>
  <text start="949.92" dur="3.72">this is a perfect time for a carbon tax</text>
  <text start="951.78" dur="6.09">because it would help us reduce the debt</text>
  <text start="953.64" dur="6.45">and they&amp;#39;ve been pushing global warming</text>
  <text start="957.87" dur="5.16">trying to convince everyone it&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="960.09" dur="5.74">fault your fault your fault and we know</text>
  <text start="963.03" dur="5.26">that this is a complete hoax</text>
  <text start="965.83" dur="8.39">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="968.29" dur="10.47">is that during a congressional hearing</text>
  <text start="974.22" dur="6.6">Congress was asking asking the US</text>
  <text start="978.76" dur="5.13">National Oceanic and Atmospheric</text>
  <text start="980.82" dur="5.46">Administration to hand over their</text>
  <text start="983.89" dur="7.95">information they&amp;#39;re raw temperatures</text>
  <text start="986.28" dur="6.91">their internal communication US House</text>
  <text start="991.84" dur="3.75">Representative Science Space and</text>
  <text start="993.19" dur="6.15">Technology Committee head Rep Lamar</text>
  <text start="995.59" dur="5.79">Smith of Texas asked NOAA NOAA for both</text>
  <text start="999.34" dur="5.39">data and internal communications rated</text>
  <text start="1001.38" dur="7.35">related to the study led by Thomas Carl</text>
  <text start="1004.73" dur="6.22">well they gave them some of the data but</text>
  <text start="1008.73" dur="6.99">they refused the rest and they refused</text>
  <text start="1010.95" dur="7.02">the internal communications in a</text>
  <text start="1015.72" dur="5.13">statement released to nature Smith</text>
  <text start="1017.97" dur="5.22">accused Noah of falsifying temperature</text>
  <text start="1020.85" dur="5.609">records stating no one needs to come</text>
  <text start="1023.19" dur="4.769">clean about why they altered the data to</text>
  <text start="1026.459" dur="3.781">get the results they needed to advance</text>
  <text start="1027.959" dur="6.861">this administration&amp;#39;s extreme climate</text>
  <text start="1030.24" dur="10.74">change agenda now we see and we</text>
  <text start="1034.82" dur="8.56">understand there is a plan here and the</text>
  <text start="1040.98" dur="4.35">plan is is to get everyone believing</text>
  <text start="1043.38" dur="4.5">that you are responsible for global</text>
  <text start="1045.33" dur="4.08">warming now yes is there climate change</text>
  <text start="1047.88" dur="3.96">of course the climate is changing all</text>
  <text start="1049.41" dur="4.68">the time but they&amp;#39;re trying to convince</text>
  <text start="1051.84" dur="6">you as a human being that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1054.09" dur="5.37">responsible for all of it and they keep</text>
  <text start="1057.84" dur="2.97">changing the story if we went all the</text>
  <text start="1059.46" dur="4.02">way back to nineteen seventy all the way</text>
  <text start="1060.81" dur="4.89">up today they keep changing what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1063.48" dur="4.47">to happen I mean they can&amp;#39;t even predict</text>
  <text start="1065.7" dur="5.4">the weather day to day and you want them</text>
  <text start="1067.95" dur="4.83">to predict global warming and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1071.1" dur="4.77">trying to tell us that we&amp;#39;re responsible</text>
  <text start="1072.78" dur="5.97">now Christine Lagarde came out and said</text>
  <text start="1075.87" dur="5.37">it this is to pay down this massive debt</text>
  <text start="1078.75" dur="4.56">this is why they want to tack on a ten</text>
  <text start="1081.24" dur="4.94">percent wealth tax and if they can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="1083.31" dur="6.42">that they&amp;#39;ll do it with a carbon tax and</text>
  <text start="1086.18" dur="6.19">from an agency not releasing their raw</text>
  <text start="1089.73" dur="4.08">data and their information this shows</text>
  <text start="1092.37" dur="5.79">you they have a problem with it because</text>
  <text start="1093.81" dur="5.82">science you can continually repeat all</text>
  <text start="1098.16" dur="4.38">of it and you should get</text>
  <text start="1099.63" dur="4.98">the same results but they don&amp;#39;t want you</text>
  <text start="1102.54" dur="4.83">to do this and this is why they&amp;#39;re</text>
