  <text start="102.47" dur="4.89">the past couple of days since Trump came</text>
  <text start="104.96" dur="4.68">out and said something about those</text>
  <text start="107.36" dur="4.92">players that kneel during the NFL games</text>
  <text start="109.64" dur="5.7">during the national anthem we can see</text>
  <text start="112.28" dur="4.74">there&amp;#39;s quite a backlash against the NFL</text>
  <text start="115.34" dur="4.47">there are individuals that are burning</text>
  <text start="117.02" dur="5.82">their jerseys right now we also now see</text>
  <text start="119.81" dur="5.46">that there are sponsors that are</text>
  <text start="122.84" dur="5.52">beginning to pull their ad dollars from</text>
  <text start="125.27" dur="5.37">the NFL and at least one major company</text>
  <text start="128.36" dur="4.74">right now has pulled the company&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="130.64" dur="5.25">advertising and sponsorship money this</text>
  <text start="133.1" dur="5.88">is coming from Jones the CEO of payday</text>

  <text start="138.98" dur="4.23">of Hardwick clothes America&amp;#39;s oldest</text>
  <text start="140.96" dur="5.4">suit maker and he looked at what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="143.21" dur="6.03">on he&amp;#39;s saying listen we can&amp;#39;t be a part</text>
  <text start="146.36" dur="5.79">of this now as a reminder the league and</text>
  <text start="149.24" dur="4.88">its 32 teams make around 1.25 billion</text>
  <text start="152.15" dur="5.97">from corporate partners and advertisers</text>
  <text start="154.12" dur="7.9">last year and what we&amp;#39;re seeing at this</text>
  <text start="158.12" dur="6.63">point is that a lot of these sponsors a</text>
  <text start="162.02" dur="6.299">lot of these companies they might be</text>
  <text start="164.75" dur="6.9">pulling a lot more from the NFL and at</text>
  <text start="168.319" dur="6.361">this point we can see that this is the</text>
  <text start="171.65" dur="4.5">backlash when you do something like this</text>
  <text start="174.68" dur="3.029">the people are going to speak out</text>
  <text start="176.15" dur="4.8">sponsors are going to speak out and</text>
  <text start="177.709" dur="6.481">that&amp;#39;s how you know you know if what</text>
  <text start="180.95" dur="5.25">you&amp;#39;re doing you know resonates with the</text>
  <text start="184.19" dur="3.03">people or it doesn&amp;#39;t resonate with the</text>
  <text start="186.2" dur="2.82">people</text>
  <text start="187.22" dur="4.44">and we&amp;#39;re starting to see that maybe</text>
  <text start="189.02" dur="4.89">this doesn&amp;#39;t resonate with the people</text>
  <text start="191.66" dur="4.32">right now we see the corporate media&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="193.91" dur="5.04">bashing Trump saying that he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="195.98" dur="5.64">helping Puerto Rico and actually Trump</text>
  <text start="198.95" dur="4.65">is helping Puerto Rico he ordered the</text>
  <text start="201.62" dur="4.62">Jones Act to be way for shipments to</text>
  <text start="203.6" dur="5.25">hurricane to the hurricane area Puerto</text>
  <text start="206.24" dur="4.8">Rico immediately the 1920 Jones Act</text>
  <text start="208.85" dur="4.05">requires shipments of goods between two</text>
  <text start="211.04" dur="5.61">US ports to be made with American flag</text>
  <text start="212.9" dur="7.05">vessels only and now other ships flying</text>
  <text start="216.65" dur="5.61">different Flags can come in and drop off</text>
  <text start="219.95" dur="4.83">goods in Puerto Rico and we can see</text>
  <text start="222.26" dur="4.65">right now that this is desperately</text>
  <text start="224.78" dur="4.86">needed in this area because the people</text>
  <text start="226.91" dur="5.57">there are really suffering we see that</text>
  <text start="229.64" dur="6.09">Wall Street and the City of London and</text>
  <text start="232.48" dur="5.35">the banking system they&amp;#39;re very worried</text>
  <text start="235.73" dur="4.979">about Catalonia and they&amp;#39;re worried</text>
  <text start="237.83" dur="6.6">about there might be maybe some type of</text>
  <text start="240.709" dur="5.671">Black Swan that might occur during this</text>
  <text start="244.43" dur="4.65">period if the referendum goes through</text>
  <text start="246.38" dur="4.92">and in recent days JPMorgan Chase</text>
  <text start="249.08" dur="4.98">Goldman Sachs ing have warned about the</text>
  <text start="251.3" dur="5.939">political situation in Spain&amp;#39;s area</text>
  <text start="254.06" dur="6.66">Catalonia where they&amp;#39;re saying that this</text>
  <text start="257.239" dur="5.551">might be a major problem economically</text>
  <text start="260.72" dur="5.43">and of course what they&amp;#39;re worried about</text>
  <text start="262.79" dur="5.67">is their investments what they can</text>
  <text start="266.15" dur="3.75">control is Catalonia gonna have their</text>
  <text start="268.46" dur="3.99">own banking system are they going to</text>
  <text start="269.9" dur="3.93">separate themselves from the central the</text>
  <text start="272.45" dur="3.45">private western central banking system</text>
  <text start="273.83" dur="3.839">this is what they&amp;#39;re really worried</text>
  <text start="275.9" dur="3.69">about and this is why they&amp;#39;re bringing</text>
  <text start="277.669" dur="4.201">this up this is why they&amp;#39;re making a big</text>
  <text start="279.59" dur="4.23">deal and of course they want the country</text>
  <text start="281.87" dur="4.049">to stay together and again the</text>
  <text start="283.82" dur="3.78">referendum is coming up October 1st and</text>
  <text start="285.919" dur="5.991">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to watch to see how</text>
  <text start="287.6" dur="7.47">this all plays out we also see that the</text>
  <text start="291.91" dur="3.759">sanctions against Russia when Obama was</text>
  <text start="295.07" dur="2.97">president</text>
  <text start="295.669" dur="4.861">they created the Russian sanctions and</text>
  <text start="298.04" dur="4.59">it looks like the sanctions aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="300.53" dur="6.84">really having an effect on Russia</text>
  <text start="302.63" dur="8.039">whatsoever but it did create problems in</text>
  <text start="307.37" dur="8.01">the EU it weakened the EU in its</text>
  <text start="310.669" dur="6.93">competition against America so you you</text>
  <text start="315.38" dur="5.37">need to look at this and say well was</text>
  <text start="317.599" dur="4.801">this really the plan because Russia</text>
  <text start="320.75" dur="4.02">wasn&amp;#39;t competing with the United States</text>
  <text start="322.4" dur="4.86">and the sanctions really didn&amp;#39;t do much</text>
  <text start="324.77" dur="4.29">they lower the gas prices the oil prices</text>
  <text start="327.26" dur="6.33">to hit Russia that hit him a little bit</text>
  <text start="329.06" dur="7.05">but the EU and what they delivered and</text>
  <text start="333.59" dur="5.73">traded with Russia it really hit these</text>
  <text start="336.11" dur="6.24">countries very very hard and it allowed</text>
  <text start="339.32" dur="5.97">the u.s. to do more business which is</text>
  <text start="342.35" dur="6.6">kind of odd so you have to wonder was</text>
  <text start="345.29" dur="5.76">this planned so the EU would have</text>
  <text start="348.95" dur="6.93">trouble and the United States could step</text>
  <text start="351.05" dur="7.08">in and take up some of the slack and we</text>
  <text start="355.88" dur="4.71">see that yeah maybe this was the</text>
  <text start="358.13" dur="3.66">original plan and maybe the plan wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="360.59" dur="2.63">really to hurt Russia because they knew</text>
  <text start="361.79" dur="4.17">the sanctions weren&amp;#39;t gonna hurt Russia</text>
  <text start="363.22" dur="5.949">even the sanctions that are placed on</text>
  <text start="365.96" dur="6.06">the individuals in Russia that really</text>
  <text start="369.169" dur="5.551">didn&amp;#39;t do anything now we see that NATO</text>
  <text start="372.02" dur="4.5">well it might be splintering right now</text>
  <text start="374.72" dur="4.56">Germany completes withdrawal from the</text>
  <text start="376.52" dur="6.42">turkeys Incirlik airbase they&amp;#39;ve moved</text>
  <text start="379.28" dur="6.389">their military equipment to Jordan right</text>
  <text start="382.94" dur="5.19">now and we can see a lot of the NATO</text>
  <text start="385.669" dur="4.711">partners they are in the airbase in</text>
  <text start="388.13" dur="3.93">Jordan and we could see that Turkey is</text>
  <text start="390.38" dur="5.43">moving closer and closer to Russia</text>
  <text start="392.06" dur="5.52">further away from NATO and again this is</text>
  <text start="395.81" dur="4.53">going to be a problem going forward</text>
  <text start="397.58" dur="4.8">because the world is changing right now</text>
  <text start="400.34" dur="4.95">a lot of people don&amp;#39;t know this but the</text>
  <text start="402.38" dur="6.3">world is changing I mean think about</text>
  <text start="405.29" dur="6.689">what&amp;#39;s happening right now Syria well</text>
  <text start="408.68" dur="6.66">Russia and the elected president there</text>
  <text start="411.979" dur="7.351">they have control of the country Libya</text>
  <text start="415.34" dur="6.03">they want the u.s. out Iraq doesn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="419.33" dur="4.41">the u.s. there they&amp;#39;re making deals with</text>
  <text start="421.37" dur="6.09">Iran and Russia and China the Middle</text>
  <text start="423.74" dur="6.989">East is falling right now the Cabal has</text>
  <text start="427.46" dur="6.15">lost control of this area Venezuela will</text>
  <text start="430.729" dur="5.371">be trading using the yuan not the dollar</text>
  <text start="433.61" dur="3.78">and we can see that the belton road a</text>
  <text start="436.1" dur="2.55">lot of countries are joining up with</text>
  <text start="437.39" dur="5.1">this because this is going to be the new</text>
  <text start="438.65" dur="6.18">trading system and the world is changing</text>
  <text start="442.49" dur="5.46">very very quickly the reserve currency</text>
  <text start="444.83" dur="4.709">of the world the dollar is imploding on</text>
  <text start="447.95" dur="4.2">itself and countries are moving away</text>
  <text start="449.539" dur="4.921">from it and we&amp;#39;ve talked about this many</text>
  <text start="452.15" dur="2.52">many times before and what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="454.46" dur="2.4">right</text>
  <text start="454.67" dur="4.53">now very slowly everything that we</text>
  <text start="456.86" dur="5.25">talked about it&amp;#39;s all happening right</text>
  <text start="459.2" dur="4.56">now and most of the people well they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="462.11" dur="4.14">sleeping through all of this they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="463.76" dur="4.8">realize that there&amp;#39;s this huge amount of</text>
  <text start="466.25" dur="4.23">change happening and I think a lot of</text>
  <text start="468.56" dur="4.2">people are going to be shocked when this</text>
  <text start="470.48" dur="4.47">change does happen when the reset</text>
  <text start="472.76" dur="3.39">happens the transition happens they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="474.95" dur="2.97">not going to know what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="476.15" dur="4.74">because they&amp;#39;ve been told that the</text>
  <text start="477.92" dur="5.85">economy&amp;#39;s doing well everything&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="480.89" dur="4.2">go out and spend everything is great</text>
  <text start="483.77" dur="4.44">this is what they&amp;#39;ve been told for the</text>
  <text start="485.09" dur="5.01">last eight nine years and for all</text>
  <text start="488.21" dur="3.69">intents purposes they created this</text>
  <text start="490.1" dur="3.78">illusion that everything was fine and</text>
  <text start="491.9" dur="4.71">when everything falls apart in a split</text>
  <text start="493.88" dur="5.67">second people are going to be shocked</text>
  <text start="496.61" dur="4.89">especially when things change here in</text>
  <text start="499.55" dur="4.14">the United States and Canada throughout</text>
  <text start="501.5" dur="4.35">Europe and the way of life actually</text>
  <text start="503.69" dur="3.78">changes and the United States is no</text>
  <text start="505.85" dur="3.9">longer the reserve currency this is when</text>
  <text start="507.47" dur="3.66">things start to really get crazy and</text>
  <text start="509.75" dur="3.86">people don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="511.13" dur="5.91">and we&amp;#39;re gonna be going through this</text>
  <text start="513.61" dur="6.1">probably very very soon we see out in</text>
  <text start="517.04" dur="5.939">Libya right now we know that Trump put</text>
  <text start="519.71" dur="6.18">on these well he added additional travel</text>
  <text start="522.979" dur="5.911">bans and Libya is one of the countries</text>
  <text start="525.89" dur="5.39">and we can see the eastern leadership by</text>
  <text start="528.89" dur="5.76">General Xavier is saying that they are</text>
  <text start="531.28" dur="6.73">banning US citizens in the eastern part</text>
  <text start="534.65" dur="5.61">of Libya and we can see that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="538.01" dur="4.53">doing this because of the travel ban now</text>
  <text start="540.26" dur="4.14">do we really need the travel ban at this</text>
  <text start="542.54" dur="3.24">point I really don&amp;#39;t think so but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.4" dur="5.13">very interesting about all of this is</text>
  <text start="545.78" dur="5.43">that the Cabal is transferring the</text>
  <text start="549.53" dur="3.9">Islamic state the paid mercenaries that</text>
  <text start="551.21" dur="4.56">were in Surrey in Iraq over to Libya</text>
  <text start="553.43" dur="5.16">that try to take back Libya because</text>
  <text start="555.77" dur="4.71">again we have this government that was</text>
  <text start="558.59" dur="3.9">created by the US and the UN the people</text>
  <text start="560.48" dur="4.56">didn&amp;#39;t elect this government and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="562.49" dur="4.32">trying to have this government take</text>
  <text start="565.04" dur="5.07">control of the country but we have many</text>
  <text start="566.81" dur="5.58">different factions within Libya and they</text>
  <text start="570.11" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t they&amp;#39;re rejecting the UN</text>
  <text start="572.39" dur="2.97">government so it looks like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="573.95" dur="3.72">bringing in the Islamic state to try to</text>
  <text start="575.36" dur="4.14">push the agenda there but what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="577.67" dur="4.35">interesting is that the Libyan rival</text>
  <text start="579.5" dur="5.22">parties they&amp;#39;re holding peace talks in</text>
  <text start="582.02" dur="5.16">Tunisia now the United States the Cabal</text>
  <text start="584.72" dur="3.42">they don&amp;#39;t want this to happen they</text>
  <text start="587.18" dur="2.67">don&amp;#39;t want all the</text>
  <text start="588.14" dur="3.48">rival factions talking to each other and</text>
  <text start="589.85" dur="3.36">making an agreement and saying you know</text>
  <text start="591.62" dur="3.48">something we don&amp;#39;t want the UN back</text>
  <text start="593.21" dur="4.8">government in there we will handle the</text>
  <text start="595.1" dur="4.97">country ourselves because once this</text>
  <text start="598.01" dur="5.22">happens guess what</text>
  <text start="600.07" dur="4.9">well they&amp;#39;re going to move closer and</text>
  <text start="603.23" dur="3.75">closer to China and Russia they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="604.97" dur="4.65">dealing outside of the dollar and then</text>
  <text start="606.98" dur="4.44">this will just be another country doing</text>
  <text start="609.62" dur="3.6">the same thing as Syria is going to be</text>
  <text start="611.42" dur="4.68">doing the same thing as Iraq is doing</text>
  <text start="613.22" dur="4.44">the same thing as Venezuela is going to</text>
  <text start="616.1" dur="3.21">be doing and the rest of the countries</text>
  <text start="617.66" dur="3.47">they&amp;#39;re gonna be joining in on all of</text>
  <text start="619.31" dur="3.66">this now we know that the Kurdish</text>
  <text start="621.13" dur="4.54">referendum went through and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="622.97" dur="6.81">saying that yes 90 percent want to split</text>
  <text start="625.67" dur="5.64">off from Iraq and Syria and Russia is</text>
  <text start="629.78" dur="4.17">out there and the Russian Foreign</text>
  <text start="631.31" dur="5.61">Ministry is saying that we reject the</text>
  <text start="633.95" dur="4.44">Iraqi Kurdish breakaway and we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="636.92" dur="3.36">want this to happen now the reason for</text>
  <text start="638.39" dur="3.72">this is because they know that this was</text>
  <text start="640.28" dur="4.59">pushed by the United States the Cabal to</text>
  <text start="642.11" dur="6.42">make sure that they get their piece of</text>
  <text start="644.87" dur="6.44">land and create chaos in this region now</text>
  <text start="648.53" dur="6.09">Iraq they&amp;#39;ve deployed troops to Kirkuk</text>
  <text start="651.31" dur="6.52">after the referendum and we can see that</text>
  <text start="654.62" dur="5.79">things might get a little crazy but</text>
  <text start="657.83" dur="4.98">what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that the</text>
  <text start="660.41" dur="5.01">Syria&amp;#39;s Deputy Prime Minister and</text>
  <text start="662.81" dur="4.23">foreign minister has stated that once</text>
  <text start="665.42" dur="4.92">the conflict against the terrorist</text>
  <text start="667.04" dur="6.54">groups is finished in Syria well maybe</text>
  <text start="670.34" dur="5.97">we can discuss or politically negotiate</text>
  <text start="673.58" dur="5.16">internal autonomy for the Syrian Kurds</text>
  <text start="676.31" dur="3.98">now there are several geopolitical</text>
  <text start="678.74" dur="3.84">implications to this statement one</text>
  <text start="680.29" dur="5.32">seizing the initiative from the US</text>
  <text start="682.58" dur="4.2">occupiers first and foremost basically</text>
  <text start="685.61" dur="3">he&amp;#39;s going to be taking the wind out of</text>
  <text start="686.78" dur="4.59">the sails of the United States of the</text>
  <text start="688.61" dur="4.59">Cabal and saying listen yeah we&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="691.37" dur="3.39">about this but let&amp;#39;s just wait a minute</text>
  <text start="693.2" dur="3.3">let&amp;#39;s wait until we get all the</text>
  <text start="694.76" dur="3.45">terrorists out of the country and this</text>
  <text start="696.5" dur="4.65">way we can sit down and talk about it</text>
  <text start="698.21" dur="4.77">and this will kind of you know push back</text>
  <text start="701.15" dur="7.38">on the cabal and what they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="702.98" dur="6.96">do right now too by doing this they can</text>
  <text start="708.53" dur="3.6">tell listen we can have these</text>
  <text start="709.94" dur="4.74">negotiations but we need to separate the</text>
  <text start="712.13" dur="6.09">syrian democratic forces the moderate</text>
  <text start="714.68" dur="6.72">rebels from the civilian Kurd population</text>
  <text start="718.22" dur="4.22">and this will allow them to separate all</text>
  <text start="721.4" dur="4.64">these</text>
  <text start="722.44" dur="5.839">so in exchange for negotiating autonomy</text>
  <text start="726.04" dur="4.859">they can say this is one of the</text>
  <text start="728.279" dur="6.701">prerequisites before we do anything else</text>
  <text start="730.899" dur="7.62">so what we&amp;#39;re seeing here is that by</text>
  <text start="734.98" dur="6.06">Syria announcing this this message it</text>
  <text start="738.519" dur="4.56">sends a strong message to the Kurds and</text>
  <text start="741.04" dur="4.77">the United States the Metra&amp;#39;s is clear</text>
  <text start="743.079" dur="6.75">Syria is a sovereign country and the</text>
  <text start="745.81" dur="6.57">Kurdish issue issue is purely an</text>
  <text start="749.829" dur="4.621">internal matter the United States</text>
  <text start="752.38" dur="3.51">doesn&amp;#39;t need to be involved to this the</text>
  <text start="754.45" dur="3.75">coalition forces don&amp;#39;t need to be</text>
  <text start="755.89" dur="7.56">involved in this is the United States in</text>
  <text start="758.2" dur="8.699">Catalonia no they&amp;#39;re not there so at</text>
  <text start="763.45" dur="5.879">this point they are trying to get rid of</text>
  <text start="766.899" dur="3.63">the Cabal in this area Russia is already</text>
  <text start="769.329" dur="3.841">saying listen we don&amp;#39;t need the</text>
  <text start="770.529" dur="4.141">coalition forces in Syria Iraq is saying</text>
  <text start="773.17" dur="3.84">we don&amp;#39;t want the forces there</text>
  <text start="774.67" dur="7.05">whatsoever and we can see right now</text>
  <text start="777.01" dur="7.23">everything is changing and as this</text>
  <text start="781.72" dur="5.19">change continues and the Cabal</text>
  <text start="784.24" dur="4.409">continually loses their grip which we</text>
  <text start="786.91" dur="3.96">can see happening all over the world the</text>
  <text start="788.649" dur="4.051">only grip they have left is creating</text>
  <text start="790.87" dur="3.57">propaganda out of the corporate media</text>
  <text start="792.7" dur="4.17">the corporate media really doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="794.44" dur="5.16">report on anything they just throw out</text>
  <text start="796.87" dur="5.01">propaganda they make people believe in</text>
  <text start="799.6" dur="3.63">what they want them to believe but they</text>
  <text start="801.88" dur="3.99">don&amp;#39;t really tell them what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="803.23" dur="4.74">going on around the world and what we</text>
  <text start="805.87" dur="3.779">see happening right now is everything</text>
  <text start="807.97" dur="4.29">that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about there is a</text>
  <text start="809.649" dur="2.911">huge amount of change happening right</text>
  <text start="812.26" dur="2.579">now</text>
  <text start="812.56" dur="4.8">changes happening all around the world</text>
  <text start="814.839" dur="3.841">and you need to be ready and prepared</text>
  <text start="817.36" dur="3.69">because if you&amp;#39;re not ready and prepared</text>
  <text start="818.68" dur="3.36">well you&amp;#39;re going to be sucked into this</text>
  <text start="821.05" dur="2.19">and you&amp;#39;re not going to know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="822.04" dur="2.52">going on you&amp;#39;re gonna be running to the</text>
  <text start="823.24" dur="2.82">supermarket you&amp;#39;re gonna be running all</text>
  <text start="824.56" dur="4.05">over the place to try to get your</text>
  <text start="826.06" dur="8.37">supplies because there is going to be an</text>
  <text start="828.61" dur="10.86">economic collapse transition and the</text>
  <text start="834.43" dur="6.719">dollar is going to be changed they might</text>
  <text start="839.47" dur="2.88">still call it a dollar some people are</text>
  <text start="841.149" dur="3.031">saying is gonna be a dollar coin is</text>
  <text start="842.35" dur="3.03">going to be a crypto type of currency</text>
  <text start="844.18" dur="2.67">other people are saying it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="845.38" dur="4.319">something completely different other</text>
  <text start="846.85" dur="5.64">people are saying that the main currency</text>
  <text start="849.699" dur="4.26">the world is going to use is the SD ours</text>
  <text start="852.49" dur="2.84">and the central banks are going to be</text>
  <text start="853.959" dur="4.371">using the SD</text>
  <text start="855.33" dur="4.77">to have trade across the countries and</text>
  <text start="858.33" dur="4.35">each country will have their local</text>
  <text start="860.1" dur="5.85">currency which we which they will then</text>
  <text start="862.68" dur="5.13">use but in that scenario the central</text>
  <text start="865.95" dur="3.87">banks still have control and remember</text>
  <text start="867.81" dur="3.78">the central banks they have no</text>
  <text start="869.82" dur="4.14">allegiance to a country or group or</text>
  <text start="871.59" dur="4.8">anything like that they don&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="873.96" dur="5.76">that because as long as they can control</text>
  <text start="876.39" dur="5.49">the creation of currency and loan this</text>
  <text start="879.72" dur="4.5">currency to different countries they</text>
  <text start="881.88" dur="5.15">have control over them how do they have</text>
  <text start="884.22" dur="5.91">control well look at Greece for instance</text>
  <text start="887.03" dur="5.29">they&amp;#39;re in debt they have to listen to</text>
  <text start="890.13" dur="4.44">the central bank&amp;#39;s no matter what they</text>
  <text start="892.32" dur="4.5">do there they have to listen to what</text>
  <text start="894.57" dur="5.25">they say if they want austerity Greece</text>
  <text start="896.82" dur="6.39">has to abide by that policy or they</text>
  <text start="899.82" dur="4.71">won&amp;#39;t receive any more currency and if</text>
  <text start="903.21" dur="3.27">they tell them they have to sell off</text>
  <text start="904.53" dur="3.93">some of their assets guess what Greece</text>
  <text start="906.48" dur="3.99">has to sell off some of their assets so</text>
  <text start="908.46" dur="4.71">once they place all these countries into</text>
  <text start="910.47" dur="5.55">debt they have full and total control</text>
  <text start="913.17" dur="4.77">over these countries right now here in</text>
  <text start="916.02" dur="3.72">the United States the Fed and the United</text>
  <text start="917.94" dur="5.01">States are kind of intertwined right now</text>
  <text start="919.74" dur="4.68">once this breaks apart and the central</text>
  <text start="922.95" dur="3.9">bank is no longer intertwined with the</text>
  <text start="924.42" dur="4.83">government we can&amp;#39;t create currency</text>
  <text start="926.85" dur="3.66">anymore and that&amp;#39;s going to be a huge</text>
  <text start="929.25" dur="3.39">problem that&amp;#39;s gonna have to be an</text>
  <text start="930.51" dur="3.54">adjustment here in this country because</text>
  <text start="932.64" dur="3.06">look at all the entitlement programs</text>
  <text start="934.05" dur="3.78">look how much money the government makes</text>
  <text start="935.7" dur="4.17">things are going to have to change</text>
  <text start="937.83" dur="2.85">drastically I&amp;#39;m amazed am I saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="939.87" dur="3.12">going to be for the better</text>
  <text start="940.68" dur="5.01">most likely not actually a probably a</text>
  <text start="942.99" dur="5.13">lot worse and we can see that the</text>
  <text start="945.69" dur="4.53">central banks they have been pushing</text>
  <text start="948.12" dur="4.89">this preparing this because they want</text>
  <text start="950.22" dur="4.7">total control of the system and it looks</text>
  <text start="953.01" dur="6.36">like we&amp;#39;re headed in this direction</text>
  <text start="954.92" dur="6.61">unless the people rise up and say no to</text>
  <text start="959.37" dur="3.78">the central bank and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="961.53" dur="3">don&amp;#39;t know about the central bank a lot</text>
  <text start="963.15" dur="4.47">of people don&amp;#39;t realize what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="964.53" dur="7.23">trying to do and we can see that this is</text>
  <text start="967.62" dur="6.33">their main type of operation now with</text>
  <text start="971.76" dur="5.31">the TPP which was struck down by Trump</text>
  <text start="973.95" dur="5.76">they wanted to have another level of</text>
  <text start="977.07" dur="5.25">taking control of the countries by</text>
  <text start="979.71" dur="5.07">having a court system above the</text>
  <text start="982.32" dur="4.88">government but that didn&amp;#39;t work out but</text>
  <text start="984.78" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;ll stick with controlling the</text>
  <text start="987.2" dur="3.16">creation</text>
  <text start="988.32" dur="4.08">currency right now because this gives</text>
  <text start="990.36" dur="3.45">them a lot of control and eventually</text>
  <text start="992.4" dur="4.68">what they&amp;#39;re gonna try to do is bring</text>
  <text start="993.81" dur="5.93">that whole you know type of legislation</text>
  <text start="997.08" dur="6.33">back where they would have control of</text>
  <text start="999.74" dur="6.73">different governments by having a court</text>
  <text start="1003.41" dur="5.61">system above their government level now</text>
  <text start="1006.47" dur="4.35">they might do this through the UN but we</text>
  <text start="1009.02" dur="4.97">can see right now they have to take a</text>
  <text start="1010.82" dur="6.51">step back because things are changing</text>
  <text start="1013.99" dur="5.62">dramatically and once again we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1017.33" dur="3.9">go through a transition you need to be</text>
  <text start="1019.61" dur="3.45">ready you need to you you need to be</text>
