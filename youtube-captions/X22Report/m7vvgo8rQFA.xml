  <text start="99.369" dur="4.581">disconnected now that the central</text>
  <text start="101.649" dur="4.051">bankers are becoming desperate</text>
  <text start="103.95" dur="4.75">governments are becoming desperate</text>

  <text start="122.079" dur="7.081">here on the Sentinel alerts I put images</text>
  <text start="126.009" dur="5.961">from China and a tens of thousands of</text>
  <text start="129.16" dur="5.31">people waiting in line to buy gold and</text>
  <text start="131.97" dur="4.03">basically it went on to say 10,000</text>
  <text start="134.47" dur="2.4">people line up in front of a gold shop</text>
  <text start="136" dur="3.09">to buy gold</text>
  <text start="136.87" dur="4.53">the buyers lined up during the three-day</text>

  <text start="147.97" dur="11.099">going to buy gold and it&amp;#39;s just just</text>
  <text start="151.09" dur="10.83">amazing to me now HSBC came out was it</text>
  <text start="159.069" dur="5.25">James Steele came out and said that gold</text>
  <text start="161.92" dur="8.7">is going to go over 1,600 and ounce in</text>
  <text start="164.319" dur="9.271">the second half of 2013 now we know that</text>
  <text start="170.62" dur="5.699">things are deteriorating quite rapidly</text>
  <text start="173.59" dur="4.05">right now and we can see it all over the</text>
  <text start="176.319" dur="5.491">place I mean it&amp;#39;s just happening</text>
  <text start="177.64" dur="7.17">everywhere and we see it in Japan we see</text>
  <text start="181.81" dur="4.679">it in Europe and here in America it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="184.81" dur="6.539">basically covered up with changed</text>
  <text start="186.489" dur="7.83">equations changed metrics and everyone</text>
  <text start="191.349" dur="5.551">eyeing the stock market that&amp;#39;s over</text>
  <text start="194.319" dur="4.17">15,000 and if you notice they always</text>
  <text start="196.9" dur="5.25">even though the market is falling as</text>
  <text start="198.489" dur="5.881">long as they can keep it over 15,000</text>
  <text start="202.15" dur="4.53">they think they&amp;#39;re okay and right now</text>
  <text start="204.37" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s holding steady above 15,000 and</text>
  <text start="206.68" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s very rare I mean the one time we</text>
  <text start="209.62" dur="4.199">did drop a little bit below it but they</text>
  <text start="211.51" dur="4.67">shot it back up and that&amp;#39;s from all the</text>
  <text start="213.819" dur="5.7">money printing in the fÃªte and the Fed</text>
  <text start="216.18" dur="5.23">giving the 40 40 or 45 billion to the</text>
  <text start="219.519" dur="4.22">banks where they&amp;#39;re reinvesting that</text>
  <text start="221.41" dur="4.32">money back into the stock market and</text>
  <text start="223.739" dur="3.851">institutional investors are just buying</text>
  <text start="225.73" dur="5.64">up the stock buying up their own bank</text>
  <text start="227.59" dur="5.429">stuff and making the stock price the</text>
  <text start="231.37" dur="7.619">stock market go up but that&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="233.019" dur="8.101">what&amp;#39;s happening here and so I i think</text>
  <text start="238.989" dur="3.661">that the gold prices will eventually go</text>
  <text start="241.12" dur="3.959">even higher than that because when</text>
  <text start="242.65" dur="6">things start to fall apart and it</text>
  <text start="245.079" dur="6.901">ripples throughout Japan to Europe and</text>
  <text start="248.65" dur="5.669">finally hits America and people will be</text>
  <text start="251.98" dur="4.11">you know moving their money and finally</text>
  <text start="254.319" dur="3.061">they&amp;#39;ll be putting their money into the</text>
  <text start="256.09" dur="6.509">dollar and then when they see the dollar</text>
  <text start="257.38" dur="8.33">is not a safe place and the market&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="262.599" dur="7.431">going down guess what you have left</text>
  <text start="265.71" dur="9.63">precious metals the real money</text>
  <text start="270.03" dur="8.2">okay let&amp;#39;s move on here now there was a</text>
  <text start="275.34" dur="4.99">article in King world news saying a</text>
  <text start="278.23" dur="5.4">massive black swan is going to rock</text>
  <text start="280.33" dur="5.49">world markets and it goes on to say with</text>
  <text start="283.63" dur="5.19">japan&amp;#39;s nikkei plunging a mass of five</text>
  <text start="285.82" dur="6.54">point five percent Turk warned King</text>
  <text start="288.82" dur="5.46">world news at the markets may be very</text>
  <text start="292.36" dur="4.5">close to witnessing another blacks on</text>
  <text start="294.28" dur="5.22">Swan that would create chaos once again</text>
  <text start="296.86" dur="4.32">in the global financial system Turk also</text>
  <text start="299.5" dur="3">spoke out about the recent action in</text>
  <text start="301.18" dur="4.17">gold and silver and what investors</text>
  <text start="302.5" dur="5.34">should expect to see going forward and</text>
  <text start="305.35" dur="5.31">he goes on to say so i think a bank</text>
  <text start="307.84" dur="6.51">failure would be the biggest black swan</text>
  <text start="310.66" dur="6.36">and that in and in that environment are</text>
  <text start="314.35" dur="5.13">obviously it would light a fire under</text>
  <text start="317.02" dur="5.01">precious metals prices because when you</text>
  <text start="319.48" dur="5.48">own physical gold and silver you own</text>
  <text start="322.03" dur="6">money outside of the banking system and</text>
  <text start="324.96" dur="5.5">there you know we see the central bank</text>
  <text start="328.03" dur="5.43">the feds they&amp;#39;re pushing back pushing</text>
  <text start="330.46" dur="5.07">down gold they&amp;#39;re keeping it under 1,400</text>
  <text start="333.46" dur="5.42">they want to make sure that people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="335.53" dur="7.04">realize that gold is the place to go and</text>
  <text start="338.88" dur="7.95">actually Greg hunter from us a watchdog</text>
  <text start="342.57" dur="8.7">did a report today was it I think it was</text>
  <text start="346.83" dur="9.82">yesterday about comparing it gold today</text>
  <text start="351.27" dur="9.36">back and gold in 1970 where we were</text>
  <text start="356.65" dur="6.66">coming off the gold standard in 1970 and</text>
  <text start="360.63" dur="5.26">gold shut up to like you know two</text>
  <text start="363.31" dur="4.65">hundred dollars but then they smacked it</text>
  <text start="365.89" dur="5.37">down back to like a hundred or so and</text>
  <text start="367.96" dur="5.49">that only lasted for a couple months but</text>
  <text start="371.26" dur="4.05">you know many people got out of gold</text>
  <text start="373.45" dur="5.16">because you know they didn&amp;#39;t think it</text>
  <text start="375.31" dur="4.83">was a wise investment and basically you</text>
  <text start="378.61" dur="4.41">know at that time when we&amp;#39;re coming off</text>
  <text start="380.14" dur="5.13">the gold standard we were paying off a</text>
  <text start="383.02" dur="4.53">lot of different things printing a lot</text>
  <text start="385.27" dur="4.44">of money we screwed the other countries</text>
  <text start="387.55" dur="6.24">out of their gold and then after a</text>
  <text start="389.71" dur="9.03">couple months later gold shot up to like</text>
  <text start="393.79" dur="7.92">800 or so announce at that time so you</text>
  <text start="398.74" dur="4.46">know we&amp;#39;re seeing pretty much the same</text>
  <text start="401.71" dur="4.43">thing and I always like to</text>
  <text start="403.2" dur="6.96">a history kind of repeats itself and</text>
  <text start="406.14" dur="5.61">when you forget about what happens you</text>
  <text start="410.16" dur="4.47">know people have a very short memory</text>
  <text start="411.75" dur="5.04">they don&amp;#39;t like to good look back you</text>
  <text start="414.63" dur="4.71">know things that happen in the past but</text>
  <text start="416.79" dur="5.67">with the internet it makes it so easy</text>
  <text start="419.34" dur="4.68">for us today to go back and say hey look</text>
  <text start="422.46" dur="4.94">what they did back then Hey look what</text>
  <text start="424.02" dur="7.02">happened and we can see so many things</text>
  <text start="427.4" dur="7.09">happening and for instance in one of my</text>
  <text start="431.04" dur="9.38">other episodes I said the Prime Minister</text>

  <text start="453.18" dur="7.47">seven-year high and every time and I say</text>
  <text start="456.48" dur="6.27">this over and over every time the Fed</text>
  <text start="460.65" dur="5.42">central bank or any type of government</text>

  <text start="482.04" dur="9.39">of this you know it&amp;#39;s not for instance i</text>
  <text start="486.42" dur="9.69">just took a couple quotes here here&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="491.43" dur="8.22">quote basically from the Secretary of</text>
  <text start="496.11" dur="6.63">Treasury Andrew Mellon of September 1929</text>
  <text start="499.65" dur="5.01">there is no cause to worry the high tide</text>
  <text start="502.74" dur="4.2">of prosperity will continue and</text>
  <text start="504.66" dur="4.59">basically what happened after he said</text>
  <text start="506.94" dur="5.37">that in September of 1929 we had the</text>
  <text start="509.25" dur="6">crashing in October you know and</text>
  <text start="512.31" dur="5.28">basically we can see from other things</text>
  <text start="515.25" dur="4.89">even from the president President Hoover</text>
  <text start="517.59" dur="5.1">saying while the crash only took place</text>
  <text start="520.14" dur="4.62">six months ago I am convinced we have</text>
  <text start="522.69" dur="4.56">passed the worst and with continued</text>
  <text start="524.76" dur="4.74">unity of effort we shall rapidly recover</text>
  <text start="527.25" dur="6.39">and that was nineteen thirty of May and</text>
  <text start="529.5" dur="6.9">what happened in 1932 the stock market</text>
  <text start="533.64" dur="3.38">took the biggest crash ever people put</text>
  <text start="536.4" dur="3.2">onto this</text>
  <text start="537.02" dur="6.36">treats people lost all of their wealth</text>
  <text start="539.6" dur="6.12">so we know that&amp;#39;s not true and here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="543.38" dur="4.23">one from ben bernanke we&amp;#39;ve never had a</text>
  <text start="545.72" dur="4.47">decline in house prices on a nationwide</text>
  <text start="547.61" dur="4.56">basis so what I think what is more</text>
  <text start="550.19" dur="4.83">likely is that house prices will slow</text>
  <text start="552.17" dur="4.74">may be stabilized may slow consumption</text>
  <text start="555.02" dur="3.63">spending a bit I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="556.91" dur="4.89">to drive the economy too far from its</text>
  <text start="558.65" dur="6.74">full employment path that was member</text>
  <text start="561.8" dur="7.23">nakki in 2005 basically what happened</text>
  <text start="565.39" dur="6.94">after that basically houses kind of lost</text>
  <text start="569.03" dur="6.27">half their value unemployment went to</text>
  <text start="572.33" dur="6.24">new record highs if they&amp;#39;re at record</text>
  <text start="575.3" dur="7.86">highs right now because if you don&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="578.57" dur="7.04">the modified calculations and now the</text>
  <text start="583.16" dur="5.04">new gauge that they&amp;#39;re using to</text>

  <text start="588.2" dur="5.97">unemployment right now is at</text>
  <text start="589.91" dur="6.72">twenty-three percent and this is ben</text>
  <text start="594.17" dur="5.31">bernanke also the Federal Reserve is not</text>
  <text start="596.63" dur="6.27">currently forecasting a recession this</text>

  <text start="759.11" dur="6.42">of time and then it runs out it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="762.47" dur="7.65">same thing with the balance they have no</text>
  <text start="765.53" dur="8.43">way of generating income in cyprus for</text>

  <text start="893.06" dur="5.16">the bottom of this one we already know</text>
  <text start="895.1" dur="4.56">what&amp;#39;s happening but when the mainstream</text>
  <text start="898.22" dur="3.419">media and the government doesn&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="899.66" dur="4.71">you it seems like it came out of left</text>
  <text start="901.639" dur="7.38">field but really they know exactly</text>
  <text start="904.37" dur="7.319">what&amp;#39;s happening so now what we see here</text>
  <text start="909.019" dur="5.67">is treasury sales by foreigners hit</text>

  <text start="944.22" dur="6.619">there they&amp;#39;re not getting anything for</text>
  <text start="946.589" dur="6.99">it so they&amp;#39;re starting to dump them and</text>
  <text start="950.839" dur="7.05">basically what&amp;#39;s going to happen is when</text>
  <text start="953.579" dur="7.681">we see other nations trying to dump this</text>
  <text start="957.889" dur="6.25">that&amp;#39;s when the bond market is start is</text>

  <text start="973.23" dur="3.93">trying to get rid of it that&amp;#39;s when it</text>
  <text start="975.089" dur="7.161">falls apart and we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="977.16" dur="7.56">this now now the government I mean</text>
  <text start="982.25" dur="6.779">mainstream media government they like to</text>
  <text start="984.72" dur="8.369">you know not tell us I to me personally</text>

  <text start="993.089" dur="4.821">don&amp;#39;t feel that anyone needs to know</text>
  <text start="995.25" dur="7.11">this but this is to me is equivalent to</text>
  <text start="997.91" dur="6.85">lying because they&amp;#39;re not covering it on</text>
  <text start="1002.36" dur="4.65">purpose they know why they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1004.76" dur="5.6">covering it and they know why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1007.01" dur="8.49">not telling what&amp;#39;s really going on and</text>
  <text start="1010.36" dur="10.03">from all this debt borrowing debt</text>
  <text start="1015.5" dur="7.88">borrowing debt barring we see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1020.39" dur="8.73">going to happen to all the cities that</text>
  <text start="1023.38" dur="10.199">are implementing police state type of</text>
  <text start="1029.12" dur="9.959">laws take for instance today everyone</text>
  <text start="1033.579" dur="12">Detroit is defaulting Detroit begins the</text>
  <text start="1039.079" dur="8.791">moment defaulting on all debt and</text>

  <text start="1047.87" dur="7.65">certificates of participation due today</text>
  <text start="1050.75" dur="9.39">and basically the city is pretty much</text>
  <text start="1055.52" dur="9.8">done they have no money and we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1060.14" dur="10.27">to see this happen to those main states</text>
  <text start="1065.32" dur="8.27">the main cities that are passing</text>
  <text start="1070.41" dur="5.43">these draconian police state type of</text>
  <text start="1073.59" dur="5.37">laws and you know what states they are</text>
  <text start="1075.84" dur="6.75">because they are up they have so much</text>
  <text start="1078.96" dur="7.26">debt and not enough income being</text>
  <text start="1082.59" dur="5.58">generated just like Cyprus just like</text>
  <text start="1086.22" dur="4.05">Greece just like all the European</text>
  <text start="1088.17" dur="4.32">nations you&amp;#39;re seeing and basically in</text>

  <text start="1104.55" dur="7.98">this happen all over the place and this</text>
  <text start="1109.05" dur="7.08">is why they are rushing and creating</text>
  <text start="1112.53" dur="6.17">these laws because they know these</text>
  <text start="1116.13" dur="6.81">places are going to be the first to fall</text>
  <text start="1118.7" dur="7.27">Detroit is falling now is because the</text>

  <text start="1165.15" dur="4.08">on this and they can do whatever but if</text>
  <text start="1167.28" dur="3.87">you just use your brain and you think</text>
  <text start="1169.23" dur="5.22">about what&amp;#39;s really going on I mean I I</text>
  <text start="1171.15" dur="6.39">remember like in I was in buffalo new</text>

  <text start="1203.97" dur="4.29">around the United States the</text>
  <text start="1205.98" dur="6.3">manufacturing and all these huge cities</text>
  <text start="1208.26" dur="6.93">are going bye-bye the only reason you</text>
  <text start="1212.28" dur="4.56">work right now is the way it is and</text>
  <text start="1215.19" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re getting by is because they have</text>
  <text start="1216.84" dur="4.8">wall street but you know what happened</text>
  <text start="1219.24" dur="5.6">in two thousand eight people moved out</text>

  <text start="1237.75" dur="7.8">neighborhoods and I know up in in New</text>
  <text start="1240.69" dur="6.84">York in west chester area there used to</text>
  <text start="1245.55" dur="3.96">be like the school system because there</text>
  <text start="1247.53" dur="5.82">were so many people living there they</text>
  <text start="1249.51" dur="8.58">were like four elementary schools now</text>

  <text start="1258.09" dur="7.11">there&amp;#39;s one in a certain town and half</text>
  <text start="1262.86" dur="6.93">of that school is now the administrative</text>
  <text start="1265.2" dur="8.04">offices because people moved out because</text>
  <text start="1269.79" dur="6.3">they couldn&amp;#39;t find work because all of</text>
  <text start="1273.24" dur="4.68">these companies scaled back all these</text>
  <text start="1276.09" dur="6.06">companies instead of hiring full-time</text>
  <text start="1277.92" dur="6.36">people are hiring contract workers on an</text>
  <text start="1282.15" dur="4.49">hourly basis with no benefits no</text>
  <text start="1284.28" dur="5.04">pensions so when we also talk about</text>
  <text start="1286.64" dur="4.81">employment we&amp;#39;re talking about people</text>
  <text start="1289.32" dur="7.32">who have contract work that can be let</text>
  <text start="1291.45" dur="7.5">go in a second and those people of the</text>
  <text start="1296.64" dur="4.35">first ago and then they move on to the</text>
  <text start="1298.95" dur="5.1">people who are full-time but it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1300.99" dur="5.07">easy to have a skeleton crew working at</text>
  <text start="1304.05" dur="4.08">a company and most of the time what</text>
  <text start="1306.06" dur="4.14">these companies do is they lay off you</text>
  <text start="1308.13" dur="4.17">they lay off the person and I know a lot</text>
  <text start="1310.2" dur="3.66">of people that this happened to they lay</text>

  <text start="1317.67" dur="4.77">don&amp;#39;t have to give them a pension or</text>
  <text start="1320.07" dur="4.11">benefit they just pay them an hourly</text>
