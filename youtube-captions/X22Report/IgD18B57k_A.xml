  <text start="33.84" dur="4.77">date is September second 2014 and the</text>
  <text start="36.809" dur="4.591">thought of this episode is the 60-day</text>
  <text start="38.61" dur="4.56">countdown begins will this lead to the</text>
  <text start="41.4" dur="5.64">false flag event and what I mean by this</text>
  <text start="43.17" dur="7.489">is that it seems that Obama informed</text>
  <text start="47.04" dur="6.21">Congress that he is bombing Iraq and</text>
  <text start="50.659" dur="5.741">this is in accordance with the wars</text>
  <text start="53.25" dur="4.589">Powers Act and it gives him 60 days to</text>
  <text start="56.4" dur="4.32">carry the Saturn of course he was</text>
  <text start="57.839" dur="5.311">bombing in August but he decided to tell</text>
  <text start="60.72" dur="5.22">them right now so here we are with this</text>
  <text start="63.15" dur="4.59">60-day time period and after this he</text>
  <text start="65.94" dur="5.039">needs to get a that he needs to get</text>
  <text start="67.74" dur="5.25">approval from Congress or there needs to</text>
  <text start="70.979" dur="3.57">be some type of an event where he can</text>
  <text start="72.99" dur="4.44">say the United States was attacked and</text>
  <text start="74.549" dur="7.14">we can go ahead and go full blast into</text>
  <text start="77.43" dur="6.84">war now this timeframe brings us to</text>
  <text start="81.689" dur="4.5">october november around this area</text>
  <text start="84.27" dur="4.349">because we have 30 days in September 30</text>
  <text start="86.189" dur="5.22">days in october and we&amp;#39;re right in this</text>
  <text start="88.619" dur="6.39">area now we understand the fed is going</text>
  <text start="91.409" dur="5.761">to be out of the stimulus package deal</text>
  <text start="95.009" dur="3.96">that they&amp;#39;ve been doing and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="97.17" dur="4.379">going to of course use back channels to</text>
  <text start="98.969" dur="5.4">keep this going to continually use the</text>
  <text start="101.549" dur="5.191">bond purchasing in another way but with</text>
  <text start="104.369" dur="4.11">everyone else looking at this and not</text>
  <text start="106.74" dur="3.86">understanding what&amp;#39;s going on they will</text>
  <text start="108.479" dur="6.09">believe that the fed is no longer</text>
  <text start="110.6" dur="8.409">stimulating the economy and we also see</text>
  <text start="114.569" dur="6.781">that different flash points are starting</text>
  <text start="119.009" dur="4.56">to really heat up in all different areas</text>
  <text start="121.35" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re looking at the Middle East we see</text>
  <text start="123.569" dur="4.41">many countries now falling the</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="4.17">government&amp;#39;s or on their last leg or</text>
  <text start="127.979" dur="4.111">they are out and the central bankers are</text>
  <text start="130.02" dur="5.4">looking at this going okay we need to</text>
  <text start="132.09" dur="5.759">ramp this up we need to accelerate it we</text>
  <text start="135.42" dur="4.77">need this event now and we can see that</text>
  <text start="137.849" dur="2.791">they&amp;#39;re really pushing this we&amp;#39;ve just</text>
  <text start="140.19" dur="4.62">had</text>
  <text start="140.64" dur="6.63">word that salt loss was beheaded of</text>
  <text start="144.81" dur="5.7">course it&amp;#39;s very very difficult to find</text>
  <text start="147.27" dur="5.82">the video i have two pictures posted on</text>
  <text start="150.51" dur="5.34">the site these pictures were from zero</text>
  <text start="153.09" dur="5.369">hedge from site and all of a sudden they</text>
  <text start="155.85" dur="5.37">were off of zero hedge i still have them</text>
  <text start="158.459" dur="4.831">and again it looks a little fishy to me</text>
  <text start="161.22" dur="4.05">because the body sizes are completely</text>
  <text start="163.29" dur="4.26">different just looking at these pictures</text>
  <text start="165.27" dur="4.29">but of course yesterday i said that the</text>
  <text start="167.55" dur="4.019">Islamic state will no longer put out</text>
  <text start="169.56" dur="4.29">these videos and I notice that the</text>
  <text start="171.569" dur="5.581">pictures that they&amp;#39;ve shown the still</text>
  <text start="173.85" dur="5.25">shots they&amp;#39;re far away plus they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="177.15" dur="4.89">cropped in a certain way where you can</text>
  <text start="179.1" dur="4.68">can&amp;#39;t really see anything else except</text>
  <text start="182.04" dur="4.65">what they want you to see so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="183.78" dur="4.59">being very very careful right now to</text>
  <text start="186.69" dur="3.86">make sure they don&amp;#39;t mess up like they</text>
  <text start="188.37" dur="4.92">used to and it seems like they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="190.55" dur="4.93">producing the video and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="193.29" dur="4.77">pretty much telling you that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="195.48" dur="4.35">video the man was beheaded just please</text>
  <text start="198.06" dur="4.47">believe us that&amp;#39;s all we want you to do</text>
  <text start="199.83" dur="4.32">and again around the country doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="202.53" dur="4.65">matter if people see the video or not</text>
  <text start="204.15" dur="5.91">all they need to do is continually build</text>
  <text start="207.18" dur="5.76">up the story and the story is we have</text>
  <text start="210.06" dur="5.07">this terrorist group in Iraq spreading</text>
  <text start="212.94" dur="4.26">into Syria it&amp;#39;s getting out of control</text>
  <text start="215.13" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re continually killing Americans</text>
  <text start="217.2" dur="4.86">and eventually we will need to go in</text>
  <text start="220.62" dur="4.17">there when I say we is the United States</text>
  <text start="222.06" dur="6.269">central bankers go in there and get the</text>
  <text start="224.79" dur="5.85">Islamic state now of course Obama would</text>
  <text start="228.329" dur="4.831">have to go to Congress and they would</text>
  <text start="230.64" dur="6.72">have to vote on this we see polls right</text>
  <text start="233.16" dur="6.24">now being taken from you gov and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="237.36" dur="5.04">showing that yes the American people are</text>
  <text start="239.4" dur="5.339">all for war going into Syria of course</text>
  <text start="242.4" dur="4.2">last year the same exact time period the</text>
  <text start="244.739" dur="4.771">American people were not for this</text>
  <text start="246.6" dur="5.91">whatsoever now I&amp;#39;ve taken a poll on the</text>
  <text start="249.51" dur="4.74">x 22 report com site and the results are</text>
  <text start="252.51" dur="4.289">completely opposite it looks like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="254.25" dur="5.1">eighty four percent now that are saying</text>
  <text start="256.799" dur="5.341">absolutely not and sixteen percent</text>
  <text start="259.35" dur="4.65">saying yes let&amp;#39;s go into Syria so I see</text>
  <text start="262.14" dur="4.08">on many other sites they&amp;#39;re getting the</text>
  <text start="264" dur="4.169">same readings as me and it looks like</text>
  <text start="266.22" dur="3.69">the governmental sites are getting the</text>
  <text start="268.169" dur="4.531">one saying yes it looks like the</text>
  <text start="269.91" dur="4.44">American people are all for it so we can</text>
  <text start="272.7" dur="3">see right now</text>
  <text start="274.35" dur="3.75">when they look at these poll numbers</text>
  <text start="275.7" dur="4.86">they are convinced they are ready to go</text>
  <text start="278.1" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re ready to push this event forward</text>
  <text start="280.56" dur="6.78">and to really get the forces there in</text>
  <text start="283.38" dur="6.18">full armament and everything else they</text>
  <text start="287.34" dur="3.96">will need some type of an event because</text>
  <text start="289.56" dur="4.89">they realize this economy is falling</text>
  <text start="291.3" dur="5.61">apart it is collapsing and they need</text>
  <text start="294.45" dur="5.52">something to pretty much mask all of it</text>
  <text start="296.91" dur="5.06">and blame it on another group or country</text>
  <text start="299.97" dur="4.23">now right now yesterday reported that</text>
  <text start="301.97" dur="4.54">experts are out there saying that yes</text>
  <text start="304.2" dur="5.01">the Islamist State could hit the power</text>
  <text start="306.51" dur="7.23">grid infrastructure physical attacks we</text>
  <text start="309.21" dur="6.33">also have reports of Russia hitting the</text>
  <text start="313.74" dur="3.81">financial institutions saying that</text>
  <text start="315.54" dur="5.1">JPMorgan and other banks were hit and</text>
  <text start="317.55" dur="6.42">yes one big hit could bring down the</text>
  <text start="320.64" dur="5.13">financial system in the US and really</text>
  <text start="323.97" dur="3.21">cripple the economy so you can see</text>
  <text start="325.77" dur="5.07">they&amp;#39;re just continually building this</text>
  <text start="327.18" dur="6.44">up non-stop and while they&amp;#39;re doing all</text>
  <text start="330.84" dur="5.46">this they&amp;#39;re going to keep the recovery</text>
  <text start="333.62" dur="4.57">illusion alive and what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="336.3" dur="3.36">that the United States has come out with</text>
  <text start="338.19" dur="4.95">their manufacturing numbers and we have</text>
  <text start="339.66" dur="5.16">manufacturing numbers all across the the</text>
  <text start="343.14" dur="3.39">world here at while the private western</text>
  <text start="344.82" dur="5.04">central bank world and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="346.53" dur="6.63">is that the rest of the world their</text>
  <text start="349.86" dur="6.27">manufacturing is way way down 26</text>
  <text start="353.16" dur="5.43">countries have reported and about 15 of</text>
  <text start="356.13" dur="4.68">those are weakening to remain unchanged</text>
  <text start="358.59" dur="4.2">and nine see a very little bit of</text>
  <text start="360.81" dur="3.84">improvement but here in the United</text>
  <text start="362.79" dur="7.41">States what we&amp;#39;re seeing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="364.65" dur="8.28">saying we are in full recovery the ISF</text>
  <text start="370.2" dur="4.65">manufacturing has risen almost without</text>
  <text start="372.93" dur="5.4">hesitation for the seventh month from</text>
  <text start="374.85" dur="6.57">January collapsing to new three-year</text>
  <text start="378.33" dur="5.46">highs printing at a dramatic 59 the</text>
  <text start="381.42" dur="6.03">biggest beat in over a year just shy of</text>
  <text start="383.79" dur="5.31">the recovery cycle high in 2011 now at</text>
  <text start="387.45" dur="3.03">the same time what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="389.1" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re trying to keep the stock market</text>
  <text start="390.48" dur="5.01">all pumped up and high so again all eyes</text>
  <text start="393.63" dur="4.26">are on the stock market because for most</text>
  <text start="395.49" dur="4.8">of the people around the country they do</text>
  <text start="397.89" dur="4.56">believe if the stock market is going up</text>
  <text start="400.29" dur="4.32">the SP is going up the Nasdaq&amp;#39;s going up</text>
  <text start="402.45" dur="3.57">that means the economy is okay so this</text>
  <text start="404.61" dur="3.46">is why they&amp;#39;re continually doing this</text>
  <text start="406.02" dur="4.72">and of course when they see gold go</text>
  <text start="408.07" dur="4.74">down they say uh the economy must be</text>
  <text start="410.74" dur="3.63">good the dollar must be strong so</text>
  <text start="412.81" dur="4.32">everything the government is telling us</text>
  <text start="414.37" dur="4.86">is correct and true and of course what</text>
  <text start="417.13" dur="3.87">they don&amp;#39;t realize is that gold is</text>
  <text start="419.23" dur="3.66">manipulated the stock market is</text>
  <text start="421" dur="4.68">manipulated all these numbers are</text>
  <text start="422.89" dur="5.64">manipulated to fit a certain story so</text>
  <text start="425.68" dur="5.55">when the event occurs people say wow the</text>
  <text start="428.53" dur="5.49">government the central bank they had us</text>
  <text start="431.23" dur="5.91">in a recovery this other group Nation</text>
  <text start="434.02" dur="5.31">destroyed our economy we have to go</text>
  <text start="437.14" dur="4.43">after them and this is exactly what</text>
  <text start="439.33" dur="6.45">they&amp;#39;re setting up at this point in time</text>
  <text start="441.57" dur="6.64">now it looks like China and Russia</text>
  <text start="445.78" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re combining they&amp;#39;re creating</text>
  <text start="448.21" dur="6.15">energy deals right now Russia&amp;#39;s oil</text>
  <text start="450.52" dur="5.76">major Rosneft Gazprom and nava tech have</text>
  <text start="454.36" dur="3.63">all struck major deals with Chinese</text>
  <text start="456.28" dur="3.72">partners which provide long-term</text>
  <text start="457.99" dur="4.2">financial stability for the companies</text>
  <text start="460" dur="4.62">which are at risk of Western sanctions</text>
  <text start="462.19" dur="4.68">and decrease demand in Europe and this</text>
  <text start="464.62" dur="5.34">is coming from Moody&amp;#39;s gasps prom broke</text>
  <text start="466.87" dur="5.94">ground on the power of Siberia pipeline</text>
  <text start="469.96" dur="6.6">which when complete and 2018 will be the</text>
  <text start="472.81" dur="5.49">largest fuel network so we can see right</text>
  <text start="476.56" dur="4.08">now China Russia the other BRIC nations</text>
  <text start="478.3" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re all kind of separating</text>
  <text start="480.64" dur="4.14">themselves from the West because they</text>
  <text start="482.2" dur="4.62">realize what is happening and they</text>
  <text start="484.78" dur="3.93">actually really understand that these</text>
  <text start="486.82" dur="4.59">central bankers will not stop and</text>
  <text start="488.71" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;ll continue on this path to war and</text>
  <text start="491.41" dur="4.74">they do realize this and this is why</text>
  <text start="493.57" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re all getting together and saying</text>
  <text start="496.15" dur="4.17">you know what we need to get out of the</text>
  <text start="498.16" dur="4.95">dollar we need to have our own energy we</text>
  <text start="500.32" dur="5.36">have to have our own food we need we</text>
  <text start="503.11" dur="6.72">cannot depend on the West right now</text>
  <text start="505.68" dur="5.83">because when we go to war it we need we</text>
  <text start="509.83" dur="4.11">have to be self-sufficient and this is</text>
  <text start="511.51" dur="5.04">exactly what they&amp;#39;re doing and the war</text>
  <text start="513.94" dur="4.86">drums are getting louder and louder now</text>
  <text start="516.55" dur="5.34">in Britain it seems that Prime Minister</text>
  <text start="518.8" dur="5.429">David Cameron would like to just take he</text>
  <text start="521.89" dur="5.67">would like to take away the passports of</text>
  <text start="524.229" dur="5.401">those people who he believes is is</text>
  <text start="527.56" dur="4.38">basically leaving the country going to</text>
  <text start="529.63" dur="5.04">fight for the Islamic state or Syria or</text>
  <text start="531.94" dur="4.38">any other terrorist group and he wants</text>
  <text start="534.67" dur="3.84">to take away the passport before they</text>
  <text start="536.32" dur="4.8">leave so they cannot go fight in these</text>
  <text start="538.51" dur="3.48">groups and here in the United States</text>
  <text start="541.12" dur="2.339">Brown</text>
  <text start="541.99" dur="3.539">applauded this is Senator Brown</text>
  <text start="543.459" dur="3.541">applauded Prime Minister David Cameron</text>
  <text start="545.529" dur="3.031">announcement yesterday that the British</text>
  <text start="547" dur="3.42">government would seek a change in its</text>
  <text start="548.56" dur="3.27">law to extend the right of the</text>
  <text start="550.42" dur="2.76">government to remove passports from</text>
  <text start="551.83" dur="4.77">terrorists and deny them the right to</text>
  <text start="553.18" dur="5.37">return to the UK Brown called on</text>
  <text start="556.6" dur="4.739">Congress to immediately pass legislation</text>
  <text start="558.55" dur="4.56">that would strip us nationals who engage</text>
  <text start="561.339" dur="5.25">in terrorism of their American</text>
  <text start="563.11" dur="7.169">citizenship now the question is they</text>
  <text start="566.589" dur="6.531">keep telling us that they don&amp;#39;t know you</text>
  <text start="570.279" dur="5.281">know who&amp;#39;s out there who&amp;#39;s coming back</text>

  <text start="581.529" dur="5.43">it makes no sense whatsoever they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="583.99" dur="5.43">just pushing outwards using lip service</text>
  <text start="586.959" dur="4.711">they&amp;#39;re not really thinking all of this</text>

  <text start="1279.51" dur="6.24">what is going on here now NATO</text>
  <text start="1282.779" dur="5.581">spokeswoman said Monday that she was</text>

  <text start="1300.69" dur="6.54">they are inside Ukraine so it seems like</text>
  <text start="1304.32" dur="5.28">the opposite is actually happening where</text>
  <text start="1307.23" dur="4.5">the US and NATO are calling out that</text>
  <text start="1309.6" dur="5.28">Russia has invaded it seems like NATO</text>
  <text start="1311.73" dur="5.27">and the u.s. have invaded Ukraine and</text>

  <text start="1319.2" dur="4.8">officials say or central bankers say</text>
  <text start="1321.36" dur="6.48">it&amp;#39;s pretty much always the opposite and</text>
  <text start="1324" dur="5.549">we see this time and time again now</text>
  <text start="1327.84" dur="4.62">because of what&amp;#39;s happening with NATO</text>
  <text start="1329.549" dur="4.771">and all this propaganda going on there</text>
  <text start="1332.46" dur="4.829">and Russia seeing all these military</text>
  <text start="1334.32" dur="4.979">assets being moved hidden in caves they</text>
  <text start="1337.289" dur="5.61">are pretty much adjusting their military</text>

  <text start="1368.669" dur="4.921">and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now is that</text>
  <text start="1371.309" dur="5.85">Russia and the western central bank</text>
  <text start="1373.59" dur="6.78">countries are all making a plate towards</text>
  <text start="1377.159" dur="5.01">the Arctic and right now the major</text>
  <text start="1380.37" dur="4.89">national interest of Russia in this</text>
  <text start="1382.169" dur="5.191">region will be the use of the Arctic as</text>
  <text start="1385.26" dur="4.08">a resource base capable of providing the</text>
  <text start="1387.36" dur="4.98">needs of Russia and hydrocarbon riches</text>

  <text start="1399.899" dur="5.461">Denmark Norway Russia and the US so well</text>
  <text start="1402.899" dur="5.611">Russia is also there and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1405.36" dur="5.76">seeing right now is they&amp;#39;re all making a</text>
  <text start="1408.51" dur="4.68">play for this region because there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1411.12" dur="5.46">lot of resources up there it&amp;#39;s also a</text>
  <text start="1413.19" dur="5.16">strategic location for attacking the</text>
  <text start="1416.58" dur="4.68">other country with missiles and things</text>
  <text start="1418.35" dur="5.52">like that and they&amp;#39;re all making a play</text>
  <text start="1421.26" dur="5.039">for this region right now now it looks</text>
  <text start="1423.87" dur="4.98">like US troops are heading towards</text>
  <text start="1426.299" dur="4.711">Ukraine right now preparations are</text>
  <text start="1428.85" dur="4.26">underway near Ukraine&amp;#39;s western border</text>
  <text start="1431.01" dur="3.99">for a joint military exercises month</text>
  <text start="1433.11" dur="3.99">with more than a thousand troops from</text>
  <text start="1435" dur="3.45">the United States and its allies now</text>
  <text start="1437.1" dur="4.77">every time we hear something about</text>
  <text start="1438.45" dur="6.54">training moving military assets thousand</text>
  <text start="1441.87" dur="6.149">troops it always seems that these troops</text>
  <text start="1444.99" dur="7.23">and assets always stay in this area we</text>
  <text start="1448.019" dur="6.03">saw it happen in Jordan when the United</text>
  <text start="1452.22" dur="4.669">States was planning to go into Syria</text>
  <text start="1454.049" dur="6.87">then we saw another training exercise in</text>
  <text start="1456.889" dur="6.371">2014 and pretty much everything just</text>
  <text start="1460.919" dur="6.781">stayed there and we can see this</text>
  <text start="1463.26" dur="6.149">happening in the Eastern Europe with all</text>
  <text start="1467.7" dur="7.41">the drills and everything that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1469.409" dur="7.951">on but this whole entire US troop force</text>
  <text start="1475.11" dur="3.96">that is heading towards Ukraine this</text>
  <text start="1477.36" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re good they&amp;#39;re big focus</text>
  <text start="1479.07" dur="5.19">is peacekeeping it will include command</text>
  <text start="1481.74" dur="5.88">post drills patrolling and dealing with</text>
  <text start="1484.26" dur="5.37">improvised explosive devices so this is</text>
  <text start="1487.62" dur="3.63">peacekeeping and they want to make sure</text>
  <text start="1489.63" dur="3.69">they have everything in place because we</text>
  <text start="1491.25" dur="3.96">know what&amp;#39;s going on here we understand</text>
  <text start="1493.32" dur="5.43">that all military assets are being</text>
  <text start="1495.21" dur="6">positioned into place for war now I just</text>
  <text start="1498.75" dur="4.679">mentioned that Russia is in the Arctic</text>
  <text start="1501.21" dur="4.26">and so is the United States and it looks</text>
  <text start="1503.429" dur="4.531">like the United States is looking</text>
  <text start="1505.47" dur="4.14">towards Canada to contribute to the</text>
  <text start="1507.96" dur="4.14">missile defense program should it choose</text>
  <text start="1509.61" dur="4.74">to join after a decade spent on the</text>
  <text start="1512.1" dur="4.86">sidelines several conversations with</text>
  <text start="1514.35" dur="5.28">high-ranking US military officers point</text>
  <text start="1516.96" dur="5.28">to a common desire multi-purpose sensors</text>
  <text start="1519.63" dur="4.98">in Canada&amp;#39;s Arctic that would sniff out</text>
  <text start="1522.24" dur="4.74">a wider range of potential threats than</text>
  <text start="1524.61" dur="4.65">just internet intercontinental ballistic</text>
  <text start="1526.98" dur="3.9">missiles since the Arctic horizon is a</text>
  <text start="1529.26" dur="3.72">high potential route for incoming</text>
  <text start="1530.88" dur="4.38">missiles so-called long wage</text>
  <text start="1532.98" dur="4.47">discrimination radar which tracks</text>
  <text start="1535.26" dur="4.62">objects with greater precision than the</text>
  <text start="1537.45" dur="5.7">current system would make sense in this</text>
  <text start="1539.88" dur="6.09">area so there the United States is</text>
  <text start="1543.15" dur="5.1">looking towards Canada looking to put up</text>
  <text start="1545.97" dur="4.47">sensors in this area we see all these</text>
  <text start="1548.25" dur="5.669">countries making the play and pushing</text>
  <text start="1550.44" dur="6.03">towards the Arctic now out in Yemen what</text>
  <text start="1553.919" dur="4.591">we&amp;#39;re seeing there is the tribes there</text>
  <text start="1556.47" dur="3.75">are rising up now we&amp;#39;re seeing this in</text>
  <text start="1558.51" dur="3.69">Libya we&amp;#39;re seeing in Lebanon we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1560.22" dur="4.29">seeing it in Yemen and yes we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1562.2" dur="3.66">it in Iraq there is a mixture of Islamic</text>
  <text start="1564.51" dur="3.57">state which is controlled by the US</text>
  <text start="1565.86" dur="4.14">government UK Israel and other Arab</text>
  <text start="1568.08" dur="3.69">nations and then we actually have the</text>
  <text start="1570" dur="3.929">tribes rising up in Iraq and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1571.77" dur="4.26">where the bombing is happening it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1573.929" dur="5.611">really not on the Islamic state but in</text>
  <text start="1576.03" dur="7.649">Yemen it looks like Yemen&amp;#39;s president</text>
  <text start="1579.54" dur="8.46">has dismissed the the pretty much the</text>
  <text start="1583.679" dur="6.661">government inside he dismissed the whole</text>
  <text start="1588" dur="4.559">cabinet but the tribes there are not</text>
  <text start="1590.34" dur="5.52">satisfied with this they want a</text>
  <text start="1592.559" dur="5.61">completely new government in Yemen at</text>
  <text start="1595.86" dur="5.61">this time and the tribes came out and</text>
  <text start="1598.169" dur="5.161">said we affirm that what was issued by</text>
  <text start="1601.47" dur="4.589">the government committee is a position</text>
  <text start="1603.33" dur="5.7">that represents it and we do not agree</text>
  <text start="1606.059" dur="5.191">to it our position is still that we buy</text>
  <text start="1609.03" dur="4.14">the Yemeni people who have gone out in</text>
  <text start="1611.25" dur="4.47">less popular revolution to demand their</text>
  <text start="1613.17" dur="5.7">legitimate and just rights they want</text>
  <text start="1615.72" dur="5.84">them to step down get out you are no</text>
  <text start="1618.87" dur="5.37">longer our government now it looks like</text>
  <text start="1621.56" dur="5.5">again I&amp;#39;ve said this before the</text>
  <text start="1624.24" dur="4.83">government of Libya has fallen the</text>
  <text start="1627.06" dur="5.61">puppet regime has lost complete control</text>
  <text start="1629.07" dur="6.48">the tribes the people have control of</text>
  <text start="1632.67" dur="4.59">Libya ministry and state offices and</text>
  <text start="1635.55" dur="4.5">Tripoli have been seized by armed</text>
  <text start="1637.26" dur="4.47">militias the loss of control comes just</text>
  <text start="1640.05" dur="3.6">days after the country&amp;#39;s interim</text>
  <text start="1641.73" dur="3.24">government resigned the Libyan</text>
  <text start="1643.65" dur="2.94">government reported in the statement</text>
  <text start="1644.97" dur="5.22">that it has lost control of state</text>
  <text start="1646.59" dur="6.56">offices in Tripoli two armed militias so</text>
  <text start="1650.19" dur="6.47">we can see right now Libya has fallen</text>
  <text start="1653.15" dur="6.73">things are starting to pretty much</text>
  <text start="1656.66" dur="4.96">become much worse for the central</text>
  <text start="1659.88" dur="4.02">bankers they&amp;#39;re losing control of the</text>
  <text start="1661.62" dur="4.5">Middle East they realize this they</text>
  <text start="1663.9" dur="5.28">understand this and this was the purpose</text>
  <text start="1666.12" dur="6.03">of sending down the Islamic state into</text>
  <text start="1669.18" dur="6.48">Iraq they needed enough chaos they</text>
  <text start="1672.15" dur="5.82">needed an event they needed a terrorist</text>
  <text start="1675.66" dur="4.95">group where they could blame everything</text>
  <text start="1677.97" dur="5.58">on and have them do the work for the</text>
  <text start="1680.61" dur="5.7">u.s. government and I before i put up</text>
  <text start="1683.55" dur="4.71">there&amp;#39;s two different scenarios it looks</text>
  <text start="1686.31" dur="5.82">like eventually when the event occurs</text>
  <text start="1688.26" dur="8.4">the US will fly bombers into the region</text>
  <text start="1692.13" dur="6.54">and try to help out but really what</text>
  <text start="1696.66" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re doing they are not helping</text>
  <text start="1698.67" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re going to be pushing the Islamic</text>
  <text start="1700.5" dur="4.56">state further and further towards Assad</text>
  <text start="1702.63" dur="6.81">now what&amp;#39;s very interesting about this</text>
  <text start="1705.06" dur="6.42">is that NATO right now is ready to back</text>
  <text start="1709.44" dur="4.59">Jordan against the Islamic state now</text>
  <text start="1711.48" dur="4.95">this is where they trained they trained</text>
  <text start="1714.03" dur="4.74">in Jordan at secret bases the u.s.</text>
  <text start="1716.43" dur="5.76">supplied them with all of these weapons</text>
  <text start="1718.77" dur="5.25">and now NATO is ready to back Jordan</text>
  <text start="1722.19" dur="4.05">Jordan has its intelligence services</text>
  <text start="1724.02" dur="4.41">deploying their full range of tools to</text>
  <text start="1726.24" dur="4.77">counter the threat well they already</text>
  <text start="1728.43" dur="5.25">know what the threat is because this was</text>
  <text start="1731.01" dur="5.4">all created there this is an illusion</text>
  <text start="1733.68" dur="5.64">and they&amp;#39;re masking what&amp;#39;s really going</text>
  <text start="1736.41" dur="6.69">on there this is a complete covert</text>
  <text start="1739.32" dur="5.58">mission to remove Assad and Russia right</text>
  <text start="1743.1" dur="5.4">now a</text>
  <text start="1744.9" dur="6.42">is again warning the united states do</text>
  <text start="1748.5" dur="5.76">not come into Syria and Kerry is out</text>
  <text start="1751.32" dur="6">there and he is saying that airstrikes</text>
  <text start="1754.26" dur="5.1">alone won&amp;#39;t defeat the enemy the</text>
  <text start="1757.32" dur="4.47">Opposition in Syria even the moderate</text>
  <text start="1759.36" dur="5.01">opposition is fighting the Assad regime</text>
  <text start="1761.79" dur="5.22">which is also fighting Isis so we need</text>
  <text start="1764.37" dur="6.18">the nations of the world to support</text>
  <text start="1767.01" dur="6.15">force forces fighting the Syrian army</text>
  <text start="1770.55" dur="5.07">while it is fighting Isis so they want</text>
  <text start="1773.16" dur="5.25">to bring in more countries to really</text>
  <text start="1775.62" dur="5.85">make a run into Syria and remove Assad</text>
  <text start="1778.41" dur="7.46">so we can see exactly what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1781.47" dur="7.17">here they are creating this whole entire</text>
  <text start="1785.87" dur="7.39">mission to bring in all the other</text>
  <text start="1788.64" dur="7.95">countries Russia the UK NATO all into</text>
  <text start="1793.26" dur="6.39">this area France to help push their</text>
  <text start="1796.59" dur="6.45">agenda Ford continually bomb in this</text>
  <text start="1799.65" dur="6.54">area have the Islamic state move closer</text>
  <text start="1803.04" dur="4.44">and closer to Assad and eventually they</text>
  <text start="1806.19" dur="4.65">will take them out and what&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1807.48" dur="6.51">interesting about this Russia is out</text>
  <text start="1810.84" dur="6.66">there and they have stated we know what</text>
  <text start="1813.99" dur="6.06">you are up to and they&amp;#39;ve stated US</text>
  <text start="1817.5" dur="5.58">policy with regard to Syria could be</text>
  <text start="1820.05" dur="5.28">interpreted as an attempt to invade the</text>
  <text start="1823.08" dur="5.7">country and overthrow President Assad</text>
  <text start="1825.33" dur="6.45">under the pretext of fighting terrorism</text>
  <text start="1828.78" dur="5.22">right now a situation is emerging where</text>
  <text start="1831.78" dur="4.44">the actions of America could be</text>
  <text start="1834" dur="4.5">interpreted in a way that suggests that</text>
  <text start="1836.22" dur="5.31">they are trying to fight a genie that</text>
  <text start="1838.5" dur="6.03">have that they have let out of a bottle</text>
  <text start="1841.53" dur="5.22">let me rephrase this they are trying to</text>
  <text start="1844.53" dur="5.04">use the real threat of terrorism in</text>
  <text start="1846.75" dur="5.85">Syria Iraq and the entire mental is to</text>
  <text start="1849.57" dur="6.51">invade Syria so Russia is coming out</text>
  <text start="1852.6" dur="6.39">point-blank we know exactly what your</text>
  <text start="1856.08" dur="4.98">plan is but at this point I don&amp;#39;t think</text>

  <text start="1865.11" dur="4.32">to do is push their agenda Ford they</text>

  <text start="1951.24" dur="6.15">happen back in 2013 of August when the</text>
  <text start="1955.049" dur="4.021">United States government central bankers</text>
  <text start="1957.39" dur="4.05">didn&amp;#39;t have the support of Congress or</text>
  <text start="1959.07" dur="4.62">the people and they realized they needed</text>
  <text start="1961.44" dur="4.08">a way out and this is why they said oh</text>
  <text start="1963.69" dur="4.109">if Assad removes his chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="1965.52" dur="5.7">would be fine with that Russia picked it</text>
  <text start="1967.799" dur="5.221">up and brokered a deal of Assad removing</text>
  <text start="1971.22" dur="4.74">the chemical weapons but here we are one</text>
  <text start="1973.02" dur="5.279">year later the exact time period and</text>
  <text start="1975.96" dur="5.42">they&amp;#39;re still doing the same exact plan</text>
  <text start="1978.299" dur="5.911">get rid of Assad so we can see right now</text>
  <text start="1981.38" dur="6.07">that they are really pushing this and</text>
  <text start="1984.21" dur="5.579">they&amp;#39;re trying to get into this region</text>

  <text start="1991.86" dur="6.059">seems like we might have something</text>
  <text start="1994.71" dur="5.339">happen very very big within these 60</text>
  <text start="1997.919" dur="3.961">days now anything could happen during</text>
  <text start="2000.049" dur="5.071">this period but everything right now is</text>
  <text start="2001.88" dur="4.799">really pointing to that at this time now</text>
  <text start="2005.12" dur="6.02">of course they&amp;#39;re bringing in North</text>
  <text start="2006.679" dur="7.371">Korea we saw the propaganda of</text>

  <text start="2019.75" dur="6.69">is just amazing the timing of all this</text>
  <text start="2022.3" dur="7.32">is absolutely perfect North Korea using</text>

  <text start="2037.3" dur="5.43">instead of cells planted in other parts</text>
  <text start="2039.76" dur="5.79">of the world particularly China and even</text>
  <text start="2042.73" dur="5.16">saw even inside sworn enemy South Korea</text>
  <text start="2045.55" dur="5.76">where they bounce it off servers so they</text>
  <text start="2047.89" dur="6.06">brought shina into this also as the</text>

  <text start="2066.909" dur="3.451">they&amp;#39;re doing right now they&amp;#39;re bringing</text>
  <text start="2068.679" dur="3.091">in the other players North Korea because</text>
  <text start="2070.36" dur="4.2">they don&amp;#39;t when everyone has to realize</text>
  <text start="2071.77" dur="5.43">yet yes this is the other enemy so we</text>

  <text start="2077.2" dur="5.07">Korea we have Syria we have Iran and</text>
  <text start="2079.99" dur="3.75">other nations around the world but these</text>
  <text start="2082.27" dur="3.87">are the major players right now and they</text>
  <text start="2083.74" dur="5.85">want everyone to realize and understand</text>
  <text start="2086.14" dur="7.74">that yes these are the major people that</text>
  <text start="2089.59" dur="8.13">we will be in war with now it looks like</text>
  <text start="2093.88" dur="14.19">the Obama administration is unable to</text>
  <text start="2097.72" dur="13.11">locate 6410 shal terrorist suspects who</text>
  <text start="2108.07" dur="4.89">may already be in the country well this</text>
  <text start="2110.83" dur="4.11">is kind of ridiculous because let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2112.96" dur="4.35">think about this the Obama</text>
  <text start="2114.94" dur="4.89">administration opened the borders up</text>
  <text start="2117.31" dur="4.38">took the guards complete the border</text>
  <text start="2119.83" dur="4.26">patrols completely off the border let</text>
  <text start="2121.69" dur="5.85">anyone who wanted to come in come in and</text>
  <text start="2124.09" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re worrying about 6,000 foreign</text>

  <text start="2136.69" dur="3.81">border who have no student visas</text>
  <text start="2138.85" dur="3.81">actually have nothing they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="2140.5" dur="4.59">coming over and sneaking into the</text>
  <text start="2142.66" dur="4.22">country so does this make any sense</text>
  <text start="2145.09" dur="4.76">or is this for propaganda purposes</text>
  <text start="2146.88" dur="6.58">that&amp;#39;s exactly what this is it is</text>
  <text start="2149.85" dur="5.29">propaganda to convince you that there</text>
  <text start="2153.46" dur="2.82">are many people running around the</text>
  <text start="2155.14" dur="3.72">country and they&amp;#39;re very concerned</text>
  <text start="2156.28" dur="6.15">because you know our strict policies and</text>
  <text start="2158.86" dur="7.05">and our pat downs and our security is</text>
  <text start="2162.43" dur="5.79">not working well this is all fake false</text>
  <text start="2165.91" dur="5.13">and phony as usual because the borders</text>
  <text start="2168.22" dur="5.69">are wide open so this is just pure</text>
  <text start="2171.04" dur="6.02">propaganda to convince everyone that</text>
  <text start="2173.91" dur="7.06">these people are just running around and</text>
  <text start="2177.06" dur="6.22">this went on to say that these people</text>
  <text start="2180.97" dur="5.73">just disappeared this is coming from</text>
  <text start="2183.28" dur="6.9">Oklahoma senator tom coburn they get the</text>
  <text start="2186.7" dur="6.03">visas and then we can&amp;#39;t track them which</text>
  <text start="2190.18" dur="4.71">again is ridiculous because the borders</text>
  <text start="2192.73" dur="4.71">are wide open and nobody is worried</text>
  <text start="2194.89" dur="4.56">about that that should be a huge huge</text>
  <text start="2197.44" dur="3.78">worry and they should say you know what</text>
  <text start="2199.45" dur="3.42">we better close the borders we better</text>
  <text start="2201.22" dur="3.66">bring guards down there but you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2202.87" dur="4.38">hear anything like that because that is</text>
  <text start="2204.88" dur="6.63">not on their agenda their agenda is to</text>
  <text start="2207.25" dur="6.54">convince you that the security is not</text>
  <text start="2211.51" dur="3.93">working and these people do have visas</text>
  <text start="2213.79" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;ve done our checks but we need more</text>
  <text start="2215.44" dur="5.25">of it to make sure that these people</text>
  <text start="2217.57" dur="6">aren&amp;#39;t roaming around the country and in</text>
  <text start="2220.69" dur="5.31">different areas getting ready to do</text>
  <text start="2223.57" dur="5.46">something bad and we can see that all</text>
  <text start="2226" dur="6.63">this in the airports all of this</text>
  <text start="2229.03" dur="8.16">security is absolutely meaningless it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2232.63" dur="7.35">fear factor that&amp;#39;s all it is now we saw</text>
  <text start="2237.19" dur="5.16">the well I haven&amp;#39;t seen the video yet</text>
  <text start="2239.98" dur="4.65">I&amp;#39;ve been searching for it and I only</text>
  <text start="2242.35" dur="6.83">seen two still shots actually three</text>
  <text start="2244.63" dur="6.42">still shots right now of so cloth on his</text>
  <text start="2249.18" dur="5.2">beheading well it doesn&amp;#39;t really show it</text>
  <text start="2251.05" dur="5.01">just shows the after and before and the</text>
  <text start="2254.38" dur="3.93">body types when I look at these two</text>
  <text start="2256.06" dur="5.19">photos I don&amp;#39;t this was posted on zero</text>
  <text start="2258.31" dur="4.74">hedge and when I went back to look the</text>
  <text start="2261.25" dur="4.08">still shots were completely gone but I</text>
  <text start="2263.05" dur="4.5">still have them it actually looks like</text>
  <text start="2265.33" dur="6.33">two different people two different body</text>
  <text start="2267.55" dur="6.3">types the beheading picture the bodies</text>
  <text start="2271.66" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s cropped in a certain way so you</text>
  <text start="2273.85" dur="3.45">can&amp;#39;t really see much you only see the</text>
  <text start="2275.89" dur="3.09">head on top of the body but the body</text>
  <text start="2277.3" dur="2.94">size is completely</text>
  <text start="2278.98" dur="4.11">different from the person who is being</text>
  <text start="2280.24" dur="6.99">beheaded and if anyone has a link to the</text>
  <text start="2283.09" dur="6.66">actual video or they most likely are</text>
  <text start="2287.23" dur="4.83">probably not they don&amp;#39;t want it out</text>
  <text start="2289.75" dur="4.44">there there might be some anomalies in</text>
  <text start="2292.06" dur="3.09">it and this is why yesterday when I was</text>
  <text start="2294.19" dur="2.4">reporting that they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="2295.15" dur="4.26">release any more videos because people</text>
  <text start="2296.59" dur="4.49">look at the video they take a look they</text>
  <text start="2299.41" dur="4.44">see no blood they see no cuts they see</text>
  <text start="2301.08" dur="4.779">two different knives they see freckles</text>
  <text start="2303.85" dur="3.63">on one face and not the other and it</text>
  <text start="2305.859" dur="2.941">completely falls apart and I see why</text>
  <text start="2307.48" dur="4.26">they don&amp;#39;t want to release videos</text>
  <text start="2308.8" dur="4.59">anymore because the false flag there an</text>
  <text start="2311.74" dur="3.33">event that they&amp;#39;re creating right here</text>
  <text start="2313.39" dur="5.04">is not working for them and people are</text>
  <text start="2315.07" dur="5.25">finding out that it is fake and we can</text>
  <text start="2318.43" dur="4.17">see right now they&amp;#39;re continually</text>
  <text start="2320.32" dur="3.72">keeping the propaganda going they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2322.6" dur="5.22">really care at this point because most</text>
  <text start="2324.04" dur="6.42">of Americans do believe most likely that</text>
  <text start="2327.82" dur="4.68">the Islamic state is this scary</text>
  <text start="2330.46" dur="6.57">terrorist group that they are beheading</text>
  <text start="2332.5" dur="8.4">the heads of these reporters and we see</text>
  <text start="2337.03" dur="6.72">a lot of anomalies we saw that the</text>
  <text start="2340.9" dur="5.67">sister of foley looks almost exactly</text>
  <text start="2343.75" dur="6.78">like the sister or one of the people in</text>
  <text start="2346.57" dur="6.84">Sandy Hook shooting at that time and a</text>
  <text start="2350.53" dur="4.86">lot of things really are starting to now</text>
  <text start="2353.41" dur="4.38">blend together and they&amp;#39;re using the</text>
  <text start="2355.39" dur="5.37">same people and it&amp;#39;s really starting to</text>
  <text start="2357.79" dur="6.45">fall apart but if we don&amp;#39;t get every</text>
  <text start="2360.76" dur="5.849">single person realizing this it will not</text>
  <text start="2364.24" dur="4.47">work and this is why it has to spread to</text>

  <text start="2374.2" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s very difficult and hard to talk to</text>
  <text start="2376.39" dur="6.27">other people and what they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
