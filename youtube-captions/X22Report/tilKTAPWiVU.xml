  <text start="148.659" dur="5.64">should tell you something right there</text>
  <text start="150.67" dur="4.86">and then remember the people around the</text>
  <text start="154.299" dur="4.861">world that we sort were seeing the</text>
  <text start="155.53" dur="6.03">yellow vests in France that is spreading</text>
  <text start="159.16" dur="4.08">around the globe we have Angela Merkel</text>

  <text start="172.54" dur="6.169">desperate they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re getting right</text>
  <text start="174.43" dur="8.76">now so the public opinion in the UK is</text>
  <text start="178.709" dur="8.231">not on the side of May according to a</text>
  <text start="183.19" dur="5.49">poll of more than 2600 British adults</text>
  <text start="186.94" dur="4.74">conducted by the National Center for</text>
  <text start="188.68" dur="9.9">social research shows that Mae&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="191.68" dur="9.72">handling of the brexit is not good that</text>
  <text start="198.58" dur="7.86">she seriously botched the entire thing</text>
  <text start="201.4" dur="9.54">now what did she botch she didn&amp;#39;t listen</text>
  <text start="206.44" dur="7.41">to the people she&amp;#39;s working with the</text>
  <text start="210.94" dur="5.22">central bank she&amp;#39;s putting forth the</text>
  <text start="213.85" dur="5.43">central bank plant now the people around</text>
  <text start="216.16" dur="4.92">the world they are waking up to what is</text>
  <text start="219.28" dur="6.48">going on they are starting to realize</text>
  <text start="221.08" dur="10.71">that the central banks they are in</text>
  <text start="225.76" dur="8.4">control of what governments do and of</text>
  <text start="231.79" dur="5.009">course what&amp;#39;s part of all this the deep</text>
  <text start="234.16" dur="5.16">state now what the Patriots have been</text>
  <text start="236.799" dur="5.97">doing and here in the United States</text>
  <text start="239.32" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;ve been boxing in the Fed so</text>
  <text start="242.769" dur="6.601">there&amp;#39;s nowhere for the Fed to escape</text>
  <text start="245.53" dur="6.48">think about this for a second Trump came</text>
  <text start="249.37" dur="5.04">out and he&amp;#39;s been contradicting the Fed</text>
  <text start="252.01" dur="5.67">over and over about the Fed raising</text>
  <text start="254.41" dur="4.74">rates all of a sudden the Fed does a 180</text>
  <text start="257.68" dur="3.029">and they said you know something we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="259.15" dur="6.42">not going to be raising rates in the</text>
  <text start="260.709" dur="6.691">year of 2019 maybe one in 2020 now</text>
  <text start="265.57" dur="6.39">remember the numbers look fantastic</text>
  <text start="267.4" dur="6.75">GDP way up unemployment way down stock</text>
  <text start="271.96" dur="4.26">market doing fantastically we know these</text>
  <text start="274.15" dur="4.65">are all manipulated numbers these have</text>
  <text start="276.22" dur="6.06">been manipulated going all the way back</text>
  <text start="278.8" dur="5.22">Trump is using the central bank the deep</text>
  <text start="282.28" dur="7.949">state weapons against them</text>
  <text start="284.02" dur="10.05">and what if the Patriots done well if</text>
  <text start="290.229" dur="5.741">the Fed raises rates they&amp;#39;re screwed if</text>
  <text start="294.07" dur="7.96">the Fed</text>
  <text start="295.97" dur="9.39">lowers rates well guess what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="302.03" dur="7.67">kicking the can down the street the</text>
  <text start="305.36" dur="7.32">economy will continue to deteriorate</text>
  <text start="309.7" dur="5.59">really there is no way out of this</text>
  <text start="312.68" dur="5.94">remember Trump has the magic wand</text>
  <text start="315.29" dur="5.67">remember that data is manipulated which</text>
  <text start="318.62" dur="4.19">means and I do believe this we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="320.96" dur="5.55">in a recession for a very long time</text>
  <text start="322.81" dur="6.73">which is not reporting it an old Trump</text>
  <text start="326.51" dur="5.58">has to do is saying listen it&amp;#39;s the feds</text>
  <text start="329.54" dur="6.24">fault and that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s going to do</text>
  <text start="332.09" dur="6.15">now very interestingly Peter Schiff is</text>
  <text start="335.78" dur="6.33">saying that nobody is going to buy the</text>
  <text start="338.24" dur="6.54">feds BS next time around because look</text>
  <text start="342.11" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re telling us that the economy is</text>
  <text start="344.78" dur="4.71">doing fantastically and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="347.03" dur="5.52">raise rates and tighten because the</text>
  <text start="349.49" dur="5.1">economy&amp;#39;s doing well then they decided</text>
  <text start="352.55" dur="4.38">to back off that and the economy&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="354.59" dur="4.92">still doing fantastically actually the</text>
  <text start="356.93" dur="6.39">economy&amp;#39;s doing a lot better than it was</text>
  <text start="359.51" dur="6.09">when Obama was president I mean if you</text>
  <text start="363.32" dur="4.8">look at this to physical numbers it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="365.6" dur="6.18">doing a lot better why would the Fed</text>
  <text start="368.12" dur="5.79">back off unless Trump of the Patriots</text>
  <text start="371.78" dur="7.83">are in complete and utter control and</text>
  <text start="373.91" dur="8.88">they are in control so what do we what</text>
  <text start="379.61" dur="8.309">what can we expect to happen here well</text>
  <text start="382.79" dur="8.73">most likely the system will need to be</text>
  <text start="387.919" dur="6.661">kept up now holding the rates steady can</text>
  <text start="391.52" dur="6.51">only hold the system for a short period</text>
  <text start="394.58" dur="6.98">of time I do believe that the Fed is</text>
  <text start="398.03" dur="5.52">going to end up maybe dropping the rates</text>
  <text start="401.56" dur="4.93">and what&amp;#39;s very interesting is that</text>
  <text start="403.55" dur="6.66">Yellen was out there and she&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="406.49" dur="9.54">that the bond market could be hinting we</text>
  <text start="410.21" dur="9.72">need a rate cut now the Fed doesn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="416.03" dur="7.71">a recession not at this point why the</text>
  <text start="419.93" dur="6.81">spotlight is on them if they raise rates</text>
  <text start="423.74" dur="6.149">if they push any type of recession if</text>
  <text start="426.74" dur="7.929">they try to do any</text>
  <text start="429.889" dur="6.671">Trump points the finger at the Fed what</text>
  <text start="434.669" dur="5.461">has been what what has Trump been doing</text>
  <text start="436.56" dur="7.37">all this time we&amp;#39;re bringing back jobs</text>
  <text start="440.13" dur="7.43">were bringing back manufacturing</text>
  <text start="443.93" dur="7.03">renegotiating trade deals we have</text>
  <text start="447.56" dur="5.44">tariffs in place and it&amp;#39;s not what the</text>
  <text start="450.96" dur="3.84">mainstream media has been talking about</text>
  <text start="453" dur="4.74">when they talk about tariffs remember</text>
  <text start="454.8" dur="6.06">that the percentage on tariffs is the</text>
  <text start="457.74" dur="4.92">first purchase of those items and</text>
  <text start="460.86" dur="4.559">usually it&amp;#39;s a middleman and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.66" dur="4.05">somewhere in China so we&amp;#39;re never going</text>
  <text start="465.419" dur="5.101">to see the people of the United States</text>
  <text start="466.71" dur="6.209">are never going to see the percentage</text>
  <text start="470.52" dur="5.25">added on to the products that we see</text>
  <text start="472.919" dur="6.361">here in the United States I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="475.77" dur="6.03">very very low odds that we will see any</text>
  <text start="479.28" dur="5.15">of that whatsoever so the mainstream</text>
  <text start="481.8" dur="5.61">media they&amp;#39;ve been pushing that argument</text>
  <text start="484.43" dur="9.479">but guess what it&amp;#39;s not going to come</text>
  <text start="487.41" dur="13.86">true so as we move forward we know that</text>
  <text start="493.909" dur="10.361">the system is very very unstable because</text>
  <text start="501.27" dur="9.45">everything is manipulated this is a</text>
  <text start="504.27" dur="9.329">gigantic illusion and Trump needs to</text>
  <text start="510.72" dur="5.16">hold the economy together long enough so</text>
  <text start="513.599" dur="5.401">what is he going to instruct the Fed to</text>
  <text start="515.88" dur="8.52">do he&amp;#39;s going to Insadong to instruct</text>
  <text start="519" dur="9.24">them to lower the rates because lowering</text>
  <text start="524.4" dur="6.39">the rates the people on Wall Street and</text>
  <text start="528.24" dur="6.24">people that have been investing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="530.79" dur="7.83">gonna say whoa the punchbowl is back now</text>
  <text start="534.48" dur="6.42">we can go ahead and we can put more</text>
  <text start="538.62" dur="4.26">money into the stock market we can</text>
  <text start="540.9" dur="4.77">borrow money we can do all these</text>
  <text start="542.88" dur="4.949">different things Trump knows us he</text>
  <text start="545.67" dur="4.05">understands that he needs to do this</text>
  <text start="547.829" dur="6.241">because he needs to win the 2020</text>
  <text start="549.72" dur="6.989">election now after the election we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="554.07" dur="5.25">definitely going to see a recession but</text>
  <text start="556.709" dur="5.341">it&amp;#39;s not the recession that everyone</text>
  <text start="559.32" dur="7.1">thinks it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="562.05" dur="8.49">why do I say this what is a recession do</text>
  <text start="566.42" dur="8.74">well it allows you to do things you</text>
  <text start="570.54" dur="7.62">normally wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to do well the</text>
  <text start="575.16" dur="7.58">country&amp;#39;s in a recession the country is</text>
  <text start="578.16" dur="8.429">now entering a depression we need to do</text>
  <text start="582.74" dur="6.58">extraordinary things to save the economy</text>
  <text start="586.589" dur="6.721">that the Fed has this has destroyed</text>
  <text start="589.32" dur="7.41">remember a crisis allows you to do</text>
  <text start="593.31" dur="6.95">things that you normally wouldn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="596.73" dur="9.299">think about the last crisis back in 2008</text>
  <text start="600.26" dur="8.74">what did they do they introduced QE they</text>
  <text start="606.029" dur="6.541">bailed out corporations they bailed out</text>
  <text start="609" dur="7.29">banks what do you think Trump&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="612.57" dur="6.93">do when the system falls apart he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="616.29" dur="5.549">going to introduce things that normally</text>
  <text start="619.5" dur="6.45">wouldn&amp;#39;t happen or wouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed</text>
  <text start="621.839" dur="7.56">and Congress would stop them once we</text>
  <text start="625.95" dur="7.05">have this crisis and the people see the</text>
  <text start="629.399" dur="5.911">crisis well guess what do you really</text>
  <text start="633" dur="3.6">think they want to lose everything do</text>
  <text start="635.31" dur="4.35">you think the people of the United</text>
  <text start="636.6" dur="4.92">States after working very hard want to</text>
  <text start="639.66" dur="4.59">lose their life savings their pensions</text>
  <text start="641.52" dur="5.43">and everything else well Trump will be</text>
  <text start="644.25" dur="6.51">able to do things that he couldn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="646.95" dur="9.12">before because we have this crisis he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="650.76" dur="7.889">gonna be allowed to clean out many many</text>
  <text start="656.07" dur="6.18">things actually he might even say we</text>
  <text start="658.649" dur="6.93">need to default on this debt as we get</text>
  <text start="662.25" dur="6">rid of the Fed why do I say this because</text>
  <text start="665.579" dur="5.341">once we&amp;#39;re in a crisis guess what you</text>
  <text start="668.25" dur="6">have the event for an audit once we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="670.92" dur="8.01">in the crisis manipulation on precious</text>
  <text start="674.25" dur="7.74">metals kind of goes away gold starts to</text>
  <text start="678.93" dur="6.899">rise Trump realizes this and says you</text>
  <text start="681.99" dur="7.28">know something we need sound money to</text>
  <text start="685.829" dur="6.87">bring back confidence to the system and</text>
  <text start="689.27" dur="5.67">we need to audit the Fed to see what</text>
  <text start="692.699" dur="6.591">they&amp;#39;ve done why did we</text>
  <text start="694.94" dur="8.91">and up this way a crisis allows him to</text>
  <text start="699.29" dur="9.12">do these type of things it allows them</text>
  <text start="703.85" dur="9.15">to reset it allows him to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="708.41" dur="7.05">programs in government you know the</text>
  <text start="713" dur="6.51">entitlement programs all he has to do is</text>
  <text start="715.46" dur="8.07">say listen we&amp;#39;re in depression we need</text>
  <text start="719.51" dur="8.01">to cut expenses and this is what I</text>
  <text start="723.53" dur="5.94">proposed and during a crisis what are</text>
  <text start="727.52" dur="4.86">people going to do argue with them no</text>
  <text start="729.47" dur="6.15">you can&amp;#39;t do this I&amp;#39;m trying to save the</text>
  <text start="732.38" dur="5.52">country here we&amp;#39;re ordering the Fed</text>
  <text start="735.62" dur="5.37">right now we&amp;#39;re finding criminal</text>
  <text start="737.9" dur="5.13">activity we can see that we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="740.99" dur="5.94">enough funds to pay out all these</text>
  <text start="743.03" dur="7.43">different things gold is shooting up we</text>
  <text start="746.93" dur="6.06">need sound money the world is not</text>
  <text start="750.46" dur="6.03">accepting the Federal Reserve Note</text>
  <text start="752.99" dur="8.43">because of all the criminal activity and</text>
  <text start="756.49" dur="9.42">we need to place the system on a sound</text>
  <text start="761.42" dur="9.3">money system and you can see how easily</text>
  <text start="765.91" dur="8.92">this can play out and you can see how</text>
  <text start="770.72" dur="6.33">Trump can use a crisis to bring the</text>
  <text start="774.83" dur="5.88">entire system to its knees</text>
  <text start="777.05" dur="5.34">and completely reset it listen everyone</text>
