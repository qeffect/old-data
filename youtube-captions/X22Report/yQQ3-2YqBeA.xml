  <text start="68.15" dur="3.03">today it looks like the market has</text>
  <text start="69.62" dur="4.14">dropped a little bit but something very</text>
  <text start="71.18" dur="5.94">interesting happened with precious</text>
  <text start="73.76" dur="7.02">metals at exactly 11:30 someone decided</text>
  <text start="77.12" dur="9.03">to unload over 2 billion notional of</text>
  <text start="80.78" dur="7.92">silver into the future pits over 23,000</text>
  <text start="86.15" dur="5.85">silver future contracts suddenly just</text>
  <text start="88.7" dur="6.3">went onto the market as soon as Europe</text>
  <text start="92" dur="5.67">closed and it brought silver completely</text>
  <text start="95" dur="5.46">down Gold is also getting hit hard but</text>
  <text start="97.67" dur="5.94">less aggressively so it looks like</text>
  <text start="100.46" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re dropping the price of gold and</text>
  <text start="103.61" dur="4.08">silver</text>
  <text start="104.24" dur="5.85">once again they don&amp;#39;t want this rising</text>
  <text start="107.69" dur="4.05">because this is an indicator that</text>
  <text start="110.09" dur="4.02">there&amp;#39;s something going on with the</text>
  <text start="111.74" dur="5.28">dollar and they&amp;#39;re trying to keep</text>
  <text start="114.11" dur="5.58">everyone in the dark that&amp;#39;s their whole</text>

  <text start="119.69" dur="3.75">they did during 2008 where they were</text>
  <text start="122.03" dur="2.61">telling you that there were no problems</text>
  <text start="123.44" dur="3.719">they were telling you that everything</text>
  <text start="124.64" dur="4.62">was sustained they were telling you that</text>
  <text start="127.159" dur="4.131">there is no recession they wanted</text>
  <text start="129.26" dur="6.09">everyone in the dark into the last</text>
  <text start="131.29" dur="7.15">second when the market came down things</text>
  <text start="135.35" dur="5.4">were going haywire and the entire</text>
  <text start="138.44" dur="5.1">economy just came to a screeching halt</text>
  <text start="140.75" dur="5.58">credit froze up and it was a complete</text>
  <text start="143.54" dur="4.729">disaster now we see today that the</text>
  <text start="146.33" dur="6.57">initial jobless claims they plunged by</text>
  <text start="148.269" dur="6.821">19,000 last week to 223,000 this is now</text>
  <text start="152.9" dur="6.149">the lowest level of initial jobless</text>
  <text start="155.09" dur="7.92">claims since March of 1973 the lowest in</text>
  <text start="159.049" dur="8.341">44 years and is very close to the lowest</text>
  <text start="163.01" dur="6.569">level since 1969 this is now the longest</text>
  <text start="167.39" dur="5.49">period of declining initial jobless</text>
  <text start="169.579" dur="7.561">claims in US history from March 2009 to</text>
  <text start="172.88" dur="5.76">March 2017 now when we look at the</text>
  <text start="177.14" dur="3.84">initial jobless claims and we&amp;#39;ve looked</text>
  <text start="178.64" dur="3.33">at many different graphs of when the</text>
  <text start="180.98" dur="3.72">recessions occur</text>
  <text start="181.97" dur="6.18">and we&amp;#39;re starting to realize there are</text>
  <text start="184.7" dur="5.91">patterns that we can see now with the</text>
  <text start="188.15" dur="5.31">initial jobless claims every time we hit</text>
  <text start="190.61" dur="5.13">a very low point we have had a recession</text>
  <text start="193.46" dur="5.64">we are at the lowest point that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="195.74" dur="5.37">ever been and each time the initial</text>
  <text start="199.1" dur="5.66">jobless claims go lower and lower we get</text>
  <text start="201.11" dur="6.93">a bigger fall now we can see back in</text>
  <text start="204.76" dur="5.8">2007 going into 2008 we hit a low point</text>
  <text start="208.04" dur="5.25">in initial jobless claims and going back</text>
  <text start="210.56" dur="4.68">prior to 2001 we saw the same exact</text>
  <text start="213.29" dur="6.9">thing and we go through back throughout</text>
  <text start="215.24" dur="7.46">time we see the same exact pattern so we</text>
  <text start="220.19" dur="5.73">can see this fits into our indicators</text>
  <text start="222.7" dur="6.94">showing that we are in a recession right</text>
  <text start="225.92" dur="5.76">now and the system is breaking apart we</text>
  <text start="229.64" dur="5.43">see another store has declared</text>
  <text start="231.68" dur="5.97">bankruptcy BCBG now we&amp;#39;re seeing a lot</text>
  <text start="235.07" dur="4.53">of retail stores closing there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="237.65" dur="3.87">of commercial real estate on the market</text>
  <text start="239.6" dur="5.07">and between last year and this year</text>
  <text start="241.52" dur="6.18">we&amp;#39;re looking at 2,500 retail stores</text>
  <text start="244.67" dur="4.71">that are going to close this is a</text>
  <text start="247.7" dur="4.37">complete disaster</text>
  <text start="249.38" dur="6.919">this is not the economy getting better</text>
  <text start="252.07" dur="6.76">this is the economy ripping itself apart</text>
  <text start="256.299" dur="5.261">because what is happening right now is</text>
  <text start="258.83" dur="5.91">we&amp;#39;re deep in a recession we&amp;#39;ve been in</text>
  <text start="261.56" dur="5.19">a recession since most likely last April</text>
  <text start="264.74" dur="4.86">this is when I started to talk about it</text>
  <text start="266.75" dur="5.07">and we can see as we move forward it is</text>
  <text start="269.6" dur="4.59">getting worse we&amp;#39;re approaching that</text>
  <text start="271.82" dur="5.55">point in time where we&amp;#39;re almost in a</text>
  <text start="274.19" dur="5.04">depression now very interestingly we</text>
  <text start="277.37" dur="5.12">know that caterpillar well they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="279.23" dur="6.33">been doing well they have gone much</text>
  <text start="282.49" dur="5.61">longer in a period of time of declining</text>
  <text start="285.56" dur="5.7">sales than in the Great Recession and</text>
  <text start="288.1" dur="6.01">federal official officials well they</text>
  <text start="291.26" dur="6.99">have executed a search warrant at three</text>
  <text start="294.11" dur="7.53">caterpillar facilities which is very odd</text>
  <text start="298.25" dur="6.36">now there are agents there from the IRS</text>
  <text start="301.64" dur="5.16">and the FDIC and Commerce Department</text>
  <text start="304.61" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re all involved in searching</text>
  <text start="306.8" dur="5.67">through the company caterpillar right</text>
  <text start="309.65" dur="5.579">now is cooperating and we can see that</text>
  <text start="312.47" dur="3.33">at this point we don&amp;#39;t know exactly what</text>
  <text start="315.229" dur="3.451">is going</text>
  <text start="315.8" dur="6.209">on as of yet but we know the company is</text>
  <text start="318.68" dur="6.299">in trouble now</text>
  <text start="322.009" dur="5.851">a couple reports ago we talked about the</text>
  <text start="324.979" dur="4.951">art bubble and how the very wealthy</text>
  <text start="327.86" dur="4.589">they&amp;#39;re looking for places to put their</text>
  <text start="329.93" dur="6.12">money to get a return and one of them</text>
  <text start="332.449" dur="5.821">was art the other one was housing and we</text>
  <text start="336.05" dur="5.119">can see that they&amp;#39;ve piled their cash</text>
  <text start="338.27" dur="6.56">into art art was going up and up and up</text>
  <text start="341.169" dur="7.301">but it looks like the art bubble is</text>
  <text start="344.83" dur="7.3">popping right now and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="348.47" dur="6.539">is that those individuals who purchase</text>
  <text start="352.13" dur="6.48">their art like Russian billionaire he</text>
  <text start="355.009" dur="7.801">paid 54 million or 85 million for a</text>
  <text start="358.61" dur="5.429">landscape by Paul Goguen in a private</text>
  <text start="362.81" dur="5.07">transaction I don&amp;#39;t know if I pronounced</text>
  <text start="364.039" dur="7.47">that right in June 2008 and it is</text>
  <text start="367.88" dur="5.909">dropped by 74 percent and many others</text>
  <text start="371.509" dur="6.361">who have purchased art it is dropping</text>
  <text start="373.789" dur="7.53">quite fast and if you look back in 2016</text>
  <text start="377.87" dur="6.84">we see the the number of high value</text>
  <text start="381.319" dur="6.361">works of art sold well many of them have</text>
  <text start="384.71" dur="6.569">dropped by half and this is another</text>
  <text start="387.68" dur="5.88">bubble that is popping right now now in</text>
  <text start="391.279" dur="5.25">many of our reports here we talked about</text>
  <text start="393.56" dur="4.919">the pension problems where they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="396.529" dur="5.94">bust it&amp;#39;s not just private it is</text>
  <text start="398.479" dur="6.18">municipal state and we see CalPERS well</text>
  <text start="402.469" dur="4.411">they&amp;#39;re threatening to slash pension</text>
  <text start="404.659" dur="4.771">payments to a group of retired city</text>
  <text start="406.88" dur="4.17">workers after their City Council members</text>
  <text start="409.43" dur="5.609">failed to understand basic pension</text>
  <text start="411.05" dur="7.169">accounting and guess what they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="415.039" dur="4.41">have the funds we&amp;#39;re seeing this over</text>
  <text start="418.219" dur="5.88">and over and the people are saying</text>
  <text start="419.449" dur="8.33">listen I paid in 100 percent and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="424.099" dur="6.81">understand why I don&amp;#39;t have this money</text>
  <text start="427.779" dur="4.63">people are not understanding that they</text>
  <text start="430.909" dur="3.75">were gambling with the money and these</text>
  <text start="432.409" dur="6.12">pensions they don&amp;#39;t have the money</text>
  <text start="434.659" dur="6.421">anymore and what we&amp;#39;re seeing right now</text>
  <text start="438.529" dur="5.401">is that CalPERS well it&amp;#39;s the largest</text>
  <text start="441.08" dur="5.069">pension in the u.s. it&amp;#39;s certainly not</text>
  <text start="443.93" dur="5.61">the worst off from financial perspective</text>
  <text start="446.149" dur="5.851">but we can see that there are many Penn</text>
  <text start="449.54" dur="4.65">in plans that are a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="452" dur="4.92">and as we approach more and more</text>
  <text start="454.19" dur="4.41">individuals taking their pensions and as</text>
  <text start="456.92" dur="3.81">time goes on and the economy</text>
  <text start="458.6" dur="3.84">deteriorates we&amp;#39;re seeing that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.73" dur="4.77">going to be a complete disaster disaster</text>
  <text start="462.44" dur="5.46">in fact there is roughly two trillion in</text>
  <text start="465.5" dur="5.9">total underfunded state and local</text>
  <text start="467.9" dur="7.89">pension liabilities around the country</text>
  <text start="471.4" dur="7.6">now the situation looks even more dire</text>
  <text start="475.79" dur="4.98">if you adjust that underfunding amount</text>
  <text start="479" dur="5.4">to reflect an appropriate discount rate</text>
  <text start="480.77" dur="5.88">rather than 7.5% dream rate that CalPERS</text>
  <text start="484.4" dur="5.79">and most of America&amp;#39;s other pension</text>
  <text start="486.65" dur="6.39">policies use in fact if we look at the</text>
  <text start="490.19" dur="4.98">calculation the real tax payer liability</text>
  <text start="493.04" dur="4.65">outstanding to America&amp;#39;s public pensions</text>
  <text start="495.17" dur="5.69">and found it to be closer to five to</text>
  <text start="497.69" dur="6.21">eight trillion and not two trillion I</text>
  <text start="500.86" dur="5.23">mean this is a situation right now is a</text>
  <text start="503.9" dur="5.07">disaster and people are going to be</text>
  <text start="506.09" dur="6.87">really hurt by it now Trump gave his</text>
  <text start="508.97" dur="5.58">speech to Congress and he said some very</text>
  <text start="512.96" dur="4.32">interesting things in the speech and</text>
  <text start="514.55" dur="6.51">this gives us some type of indicator on</text>
  <text start="517.28" dur="6.24">how well the economy is doing now the</text>
  <text start="521.06" dur="4.38">first one he said was 94 million</text>
  <text start="523.52" dur="3.03">Americans are out of the labor force now</text>
  <text start="525.44" dur="3.48">we&amp;#39;ve been saying this for a quite a</text>
  <text start="526.55" dur="3.66">while not just myself everyone in the</text>
  <text start="528.92" dur="3.45">alternative media who&amp;#39;s looking at the</text>
  <text start="530.21" dur="2.64">situation been saying this over and over</text>
  <text start="532.37" dur="4.19">and over</text>
  <text start="532.85" dur="7.07">he said 43 million are living in poverty</text>
  <text start="536.56" dur="5.74">43 million Americans are on food stamps</text>
  <text start="539.92" dur="5.95">more than one in five people in their</text>
  <text start="542.3" dur="6.39">prime working years are not working we</text>
  <text start="545.87" dur="5.04">have the worst financial recovery in 65</text>
  <text start="548.69" dur="6.24">years actually it&amp;#39;s not even a recovery</text>
  <text start="550.91" dur="5.78">it&amp;#39;s a manipulation it&amp;#39;s an illusion to</text>
  <text start="554.93" dur="4.23">make you think we&amp;#39;ve recovered in the</text>
  <text start="556.69" dur="4.9">last eight years the past administration</text>
  <text start="559.16" dur="8.4">has put on more debt than nearly all</text>
  <text start="561.59" dur="7.86">other presidents combined we lost more</text>
  <text start="567.56" dur="3.87">than one-fourth of our manufacturing</text>
  <text start="569.45" dur="5.1">jobs since NAFTA was approved</text>
  <text start="571.43" dur="4.68">we lost 60,000 factories since China</text>

  <text start="590.6" dur="5.22">and sixteen percent we spent trillions</text>
  <text start="592.94" dur="4.29">and trillions of dollars overseas and we</text>
  <text start="595.82" dur="3.87">didn&amp;#39;t do anything here in the United</text>
  <text start="597.23" dur="4.29">States for the infrastructure and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="599.69" dur="3.63">why things are falling apart now when</text>
  <text start="601.52" dur="3.15">you look at all this this is what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="603.32" dur="5.34">been talking about for a very long time</text>
  <text start="604.67" dur="7.32">he&amp;#39;s letting the country know that the</text>
  <text start="608.66" dur="6.45">economy is a disaster the economy is</text>
  <text start="611.99" dur="4.349">collapsing I mean he can&amp;#39;t just come and</text>
  <text start="615.11" dur="3.45">say listen hey the economy is collapsing</text>
  <text start="616.339" dur="4.591">everyone run for the hills people would</text>
  <text start="618.56" dur="3.87">be very very nervous with that but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="620.93" dur="4.38">letting it out a little bit at a time</text>
  <text start="622.43" dur="7.86">that the economy is a complete disaster</text>
  <text start="625.31" dur="7.98">and we can see right now that James</text>
  <text start="630.29" dur="5.88">Rickards David Stockman they were all</text>
  <text start="633.29" dur="6.51">saying that he cannot avoid the debt</text>
  <text start="636.17" dur="6.87">crisis we have this date coming up which</text>
  <text start="639.8" dur="5.01">is March 15th we know Obama and Boehner</text>
  <text start="643.04" dur="3.36">they planned this Obama was going to be</text>
  <text start="644.81" dur="2.94">out of office they probably thought</text>
  <text start="646.4" dur="2.49">Hillary was going to be in there with</text>
  <text start="647.75" dur="3">all the manipulation that we&amp;#39;re gonna do</text>
  <text start="648.89" dur="3.87">for the election and they thought oh</text>
  <text start="650.75" dur="4.02">this is perfect we know this is gonna be</text>
  <text start="652.76" dur="4.02">a problem and all we have to do is show</text>
  <text start="654.77" dur="4.23">that Russia North Korea China whatever</text>
  <text start="656.78" dur="4.44">country they wanted they cyberattack we</text>
  <text start="659" dur="4.74">had some type of major event and we</text>
  <text start="661.22" dur="4.83">could just blame it on them because we</text>
  <text start="663.74" dur="4.38">were in a great economy was strong and</text>
  <text start="666.05" dur="4.38">then they came around and they cyber</text>
  <text start="668.12" dur="2.79">attacked and brought it down but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="670.43" dur="4.2">a problem</text>
  <text start="670.91" dur="6.3">Trump is in office so this is a problem</text>
  <text start="674.63" dur="4.89">for the deep State the central bankers</text>
  <text start="677.21" dur="5.25">so what they&amp;#39;re doing right now is</text>
  <text start="679.52" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re preparing for the economy to</text>
  <text start="682.46" dur="3.72">come down at a later period because they</text>
  <text start="683.93" dur="4.86">can&amp;#39;t have it come down too soon why</text>
  <text start="686.18" dur="6.54">because Trump didn&amp;#39;t do anything yet a</text>
  <text start="688.79" dur="5.97">lot of talk a lot of plans but they</text>
  <text start="692.72" dur="4.95">can&amp;#39;t say oh the economy came down</text>
  <text start="694.76" dur="5.13">because of Trump so the Fed right now</text>
  <text start="697.67" dur="5.52">they are trying to keep everything</text>
  <text start="699.89" dur="4.83">together and most likely they&amp;#39;ll</text>

  <text start="829.51" dur="8.4">apart the central bankers the deep state</text>
  <text start="833.29" dur="7.07">they cannot wait any longer because they</text>
  <text start="837.91" dur="5.81">know that Trump realizes what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="840.36" dur="5.83">they don&amp;#39;t want him to bring it down</text>
  <text start="843.72" dur="4.57">they want to do it themselves they want</text>

  <text start="854.32" dur="3.36">control the narrative and they will be</text>
  <text start="856.12" dur="2.97">blamed this is the thing they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="857.68" dur="3.69">to happen because we know that Jon</text>
  <text start="859.09" dur="6">Yellen was already out there saying the</text>
  <text start="861.37" dur="5.46">economy is weak it&amp;#39;s disappointing and</text>
  <text start="865.09" dur="5.25">if things should start to fall apart</text>
  <text start="866.83" dur="5.07">well don&amp;#39;t blame the Fed the corporate</text>
  <text start="870.34" dur="3.63">media is already out there saying that</text>
  <text start="871.9" dur="4.32">the economy is worsening now we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="873.97" dur="5.22">see a lot more of this news as we move</text>
  <text start="876.22" dur="4.38">through the spring and move into the</text>
  <text start="879.19" dur="4.41">summer now they&amp;#39;re not making a really</text>
  <text start="880.6" dur="5.82">big deal about this debt ceiling problem</text>
  <text start="883.6" dur="6.03">not as yet and it&amp;#39;s coming up in what 13</text>
  <text start="886.42" dur="5.4">days or so but you&amp;#39;re gonna see right</text>
  <text start="889.63" dur="5.25">maybe a day or two before they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="891.82" dur="5.18">start making a big deal and right after</text>
  <text start="894.88" dur="6.06">they&amp;#39;re gonna really harp on it and</text>
  <text start="897" dur="8.14">they&amp;#39;re gonna keep playing it up because</text>
  <text start="900.94" dur="6.6">we can see at this point that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="905.14" dur="6.12">gonna get prepare and get ready for this</text>
  <text start="907.54" dur="5.4">system to come down and this is going to</text>
  <text start="911.26" dur="5.51">play into what they really want to do</text>
  <text start="912.94" dur="8.64">because once the economy falls apart and</text>
  <text start="916.77" dur="9.13">it collapses we are in a state of</text>
  <text start="921.58" dur="6.93">emergency and throughout the years all</text>
  <text start="925.9" dur="6.3">these presidents well they created all</text>
  <text start="928.51" dur="7.89">these executive orders where Trump can</text>
  <text start="932.2" dur="6.15">take charge of everything now is this a</text>
  <text start="936.4" dur="3.51">good situation or a bad situation well</text>
  <text start="938.35" dur="3.69">the corporate media is going to make it</text>
  <text start="939.91" dur="4.89">look like a very bad situation because</text>
  <text start="942.04" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re gonna call him a dictator now</text>
  <text start="944.8" dur="6.03">remember this was all planned for a</text>
  <text start="947.14" dur="6.51">different individual a deep state part</text>
  <text start="950.83" dur="4.65">of the system individual and this is why</text>
  <text start="953.65" dur="4.56">all these executive orders were created</text>
  <text start="955.48" dur="4.8">because when the time was right they</text>
  <text start="958.21" dur="3.9">were going to take charge they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="960.28" dur="4.68">going to use Congress there was going to</text>
  <text start="962.11" dur="4.62">be a state of emergency but we can see</text>
  <text start="964.96" dur="6.54">they&amp;#39;re gonna play this the other way</text>
  <text start="966.73" dur="7.59">because we have our date it&amp;#39;s all coming</text>
