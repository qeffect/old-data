  <text start="64.55" dur="4.77">episode is it&amp;#39;s not the stock market</text>
  <text start="66.979" dur="5.28">bubble you need to worry about it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="69.32" dur="4.92">everything bubble let&amp;#39;s get into the</text>
  <text start="72.259" dur="4.441">economic collapse financial news in</text>
  <text start="74.24" dur="5.85">previous reports we talked about how the</text>
  <text start="76.7" dur="6.39">European banks well they&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="80.09" dur="5.04">well at all and your noses the central</text>
  <text start="83.09" dur="3.84">bank in Europe knows this this is why</text>
  <text start="85.13" dur="5.659">they&amp;#39;re talking about freezing the</text>
  <text start="86.93" dur="6.06">retail accounts when the banks fail and</text>
  <text start="90.789" dur="4.031">investors who think that Europe is close</text>
  <text start="92.99" dur="3.989">to adopting an effective approach to</text>
  <text start="94.82" dur="5.1">dealing with failing banks may want to</text>
  <text start="96.979" dur="6.601">think again about this whole thing now</text>
  <text start="99.92" dur="6.03">judging by the reaction to the story by</text>
  <text start="103.58" dur="6.14">investors on social media it appears</text>
  <text start="105.95" dur="6.449">that the EU will just like every other</text>
  <text start="109.72" dur="5.08">government institution central bank</text>
  <text start="112.399" dur="4.351">they&amp;#39;ve learned nothing about managing</text>
  <text start="114.8" dur="4.709">public confident when it comes to the</text>
  <text start="116.75" dur="7.229">banking sector now what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="119.509" dur="6.871">here is that they don&amp;#39;t understand that</text>
  <text start="123.979" dur="5.161">people are very nervous about the</text>
  <text start="126.38" dur="8.79">banking sector that they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="129.14" dur="7.319">invest in the EU banking system and what</text>
  <text start="135.17" dur="3.539">we&amp;#39;re seeing right now this is coming</text>
  <text start="136.459" dur="4.921">from Wall Street analysts they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="138.709" dur="5.851">encouraging investors to jump into EU</text>
  <text start="141.38" dur="7.68">bank stocks the fact is that there</text>
  <text start="144.56" dur="8">remains nearly 1 trillion euros in bad</text>
  <text start="149.06" dur="6.509">loans within the European banking system</text>
  <text start="152.56" dur="5.41">now it&amp;#39;s going to be very difficult to</text>
  <text start="155.569" dur="5.971">convince the people that everything is</text>
  <text start="157.97" dur="6.18">ok and all these different resolutions</text>
  <text start="161.54" dur="4.05">that they&amp;#39;re coming up with well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="164.15" dur="4.169">not making people feel very very</text>
  <text start="165.59" dur="5.43">comfortable here because we know out in</text>
  <text start="168.319" dur="4.711">Spain we know out in Italy guess what</text>
  <text start="171.02" dur="4.23">their banking system is falling apart</text>
  <text start="173.03" dur="5.73">let&amp;#39;s not talk about Greece and the</text>
  <text start="175.25" dur="4.709">other countries now you could see that</text>
  <text start="178.76" dur="2.58">they&amp;#39;re trying to do whatever they</text>
  <text start="179.959" dur="3.42">possibly can to make people think that</text>
  <text start="181.34" dur="3.3">everything is fine they have stress</text>
  <text start="183.379" dur="2.791">tests they&amp;#39;re telling you that</text>
  <text start="184.64" dur="2.09">everything is great they&amp;#39;ve been bailing</text>
  <text start="186.17" dur="2.76">out</text>
  <text start="186.73" dur="4.509">institutions left and right or bailing</text>
  <text start="188.93" dur="6.63">them in but what we&amp;#39;re really seeing is</text>
  <text start="191.239" dur="8.041">that the EU banking system is in big</text>
  <text start="195.56" dur="6.33">trouble the same thing goes for the US</text>
  <text start="199.28" dur="5.789">banking system but again there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="201.89" dur="5.4">huge printing press here where they can</text>
  <text start="205.069" dur="4.95">keep the system here afloat a lot better</text>
  <text start="207.29" dur="6.66">because remember each country they have</text>
  <text start="210.019" dur="5.011">to receive the printed currency or</text>
  <text start="213.95" dur="2.58">should I say the currency that just</text>
  <text start="215.03" dur="3.36">created out of thin air and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="216.53" dur="4.95">little bit more difficult to do here</text>
  <text start="218.39" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s intertwined within our system and</text>
  <text start="221.48" dur="4.83">that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s a little bit easier but</text>
  <text start="223.94" dur="5.4">the main thing that we&amp;#39;re seeing here is</text>
  <text start="226.31" dur="7.23">that we&amp;#39;re starting to see the economy</text>
  <text start="229.34" dur="6.72">the way it was back in 2008 2007 right</text>
  <text start="233.54" dur="4.44">before the entire system came crashing</text>
  <text start="236.06" dur="5.31">down and we&amp;#39;ve been looking at all the</text>
  <text start="237.98" dur="6.18">economic indicators and they are not</text>
  <text start="241.37" dur="5.25">improving whatsoever actually core logic</text>
  <text start="244.16" dur="5.31">just came out and they&amp;#39;re reporting that</text>
  <text start="246.62" dur="7.17">home prices in for the nation&amp;#39;s largest</text>
  <text start="249.47" dur="7.85">cities are now considered over valued</text>
  <text start="253.79" dur="5.879">and I&amp;#39;m sure if they looked at the other</text>
  <text start="257.32" dur="4.33">16 cities and of course these are all</text>
  <text start="259.669" dur="5.011">the cities like Case Shiller uses to</text>
  <text start="261.65" dur="5.07">show us that a housing market is fine</text>
  <text start="264.68" dur="4.23">the Fed jumps on top of that the</text>
  <text start="266.72" dur="3.66">government jumps on top of that and they</text>
  <text start="268.91" dur="3.6">are all looking at the same exact data</text>
  <text start="270.38" dur="4.38">saying everything is perfect but what</text>
  <text start="272.51" dur="6.24">we&amp;#39;re seeing is in the cities of Denver</text>
  <text start="274.76" dur="5.85">Houston Miami Washington DC and I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="278.75" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s going to be New York San Francisco</text>
  <text start="280.61" dur="7.83">they&amp;#39;re saying that in these areas home</text>
  <text start="284.51" dur="9.24">prices right now are overvalued they</text>
  <text start="288.44" dur="9.479">exceed sustainable levels now to</text>
  <text start="293.75" dur="6.66">determine the market value of these</text>
  <text start="297.919" dur="5.041">homes that they&amp;#39;re overvalued CoreLogic</text>
  <text start="300.41" dur="4.77">compares current prices to their</text>
  <text start="302.96" dur="4.05">long-run sustainable levels which are</text>
  <text start="305.18" dur="5.16">supported by local economic fundamentals</text>
  <text start="307.01" dur="4.95">like disposable income and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="310.34" dur="6.87">seeing is that home prices are marching</text>
  <text start="311.96" dur="8.169">ever higher up almost 50% since 2011 and</text>
  <text start="317.21" dur="5.049">they don&amp;#39;t see any end</text>
  <text start="320.129" dur="4.891">in sight right now and they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="322.259" dur="5.791">it&amp;#39;s going to reach a point where this</text>
  <text start="325.02" dur="6.539">housing market might come crashing down</text>
  <text start="328.05" dur="6.81">I&amp;#39;m going to say it&amp;#39;s not might it will</text>
  <text start="331.559" dur="9.6">come crashing down because this entire</text>
  <text start="334.86" dur="9.989">system is based on a lie and lies only</text>
  <text start="341.159" dur="6.9">go so far until they&amp;#39;re found out and</text>
  <text start="344.849" dur="4.201">once they&amp;#39;re found out everything comes</text>
  <text start="348.059" dur="4.08">crashing down</text>
  <text start="349.05" dur="6.509">now ADP they&amp;#39;ve come out with their</text>
  <text start="352.139" dur="6.06">employment figures and what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="355.559" dur="5.19">right now is that we have lost more jobs</text>
  <text start="358.199" dur="5.97">in manufacturing now</text>
  <text start="360.749" dur="5.4">service jobs well yes they were added to</text>
  <text start="364.169" dur="4.05">once again because this is all the</text>
  <text start="366.149" dur="5.341">country has right now and they even</text>
  <text start="368.219" dur="5.73">manipulate that data because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="371.49" dur="5.25">seeing factories close left and right</text>
  <text start="373.949" dur="4.5">the automobile industry they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="376.74" dur="3.299">struggling right now they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="378.449" dur="4.23">to be adding workers actually they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="380.039" dur="6.29">been letting workers go we see that</text>
  <text start="382.679" dur="7.95">manufacturing they lost 4,000 jobs in</text>
  <text start="386.329" dur="6.46">July and we know that manufacturing is</text>
  <text start="390.629" dur="5.55">having a very difficult time right now</text>
  <text start="392.789" dur="6.78">and the service industry the food</text>
  <text start="396.179" dur="6">industry the retail industry where are</text>
  <text start="399.569" dur="4.56">these jobs being added to if there are</text>
  <text start="402.179" dur="4.89">thousands and thousands of stores</text>
  <text start="404.129" dur="6.03">closing corporate offices closing it</text>
  <text start="407.069" dur="4.49">makes no sense what they&amp;#39;re doing right</text>
  <text start="410.159" dur="4.11">now is they&amp;#39;re just manipulating</text>
  <text start="411.559" dur="5.38">everything because we&amp;#39;re at the endgame</text>
  <text start="414.269" dur="5.16">here and they can&amp;#39;t even make sense of</text>
  <text start="416.939" dur="5.73">this so they&amp;#39;re just manipulating every</text>
  <text start="419.429" dur="6.09">piece of data that comes out because if</text>
  <text start="422.669" dur="5.1">they just tell the truth people will be</text>
  <text start="425.519" dur="5.04">absolutely shocked that all of this was</text>
  <text start="427.769" dur="5.7">a complete lie and it&amp;#39;s been a lie for a</text>
  <text start="430.559" dur="6.991">very long time now greenspan is out</text>
  <text start="433.469" dur="8.73">there and he&amp;#39;s saying we have major</text>
  <text start="437.55" dur="7.56">problems in the bond market and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.199" dur="8.07">saying that we are entering a period of</text>
  <text start="445.11" dur="6.779">stagflation now it&amp;#39;s not the stock</text>
  <text start="450.269" dur="3.451">market that we have to worry about he</text>
  <text start="451.889" dur="4.501">says it&amp;#39;s the bond market and I</text>
  <text start="453.72" dur="5.58">actually agree with him I think the bond</text>
  <text start="456.39" dur="4.32">market right now this is something that</text>
  <text start="459.3" dur="3">everyone is not looking at because</text>
  <text start="460.71" dur="4.29">always seeing is the stock market moving</text>
  <text start="462.3" dur="4.23">up and up and up and up and I think the</text>
  <text start="465" dur="3.09">stock market will eventually come down</text>
  <text start="466.53" dur="2.76">or maybe it will just keep going up it</text>
  <text start="468.09" dur="3">doesn&amp;#39;t really matter because it means</text>
  <text start="469.29" dur="5.73">absolutely nothing I think the bond</text>
  <text start="471.09" dur="6.36">market is the important area right now</text>
  <text start="475.02" dur="4.56">now ten-year government bonds their</text>
  <text start="477.45" dur="4.95">yields fell from fifteen point eight</text>
  <text start="479.58" dur="5.88">percent in 1981 to two point three</text>
  <text start="482.4" dur="3.57">percent I mean think about this for a</text>
  <text start="485.46" dur="4.17">second</text>
  <text start="485.97" dur="7.5">now we&amp;#39;re experiencing a bubble not in</text>
  <text start="489.63" dur="7.77">stock prices but in bond prices and this</text>
  <text start="493.47" dur="8.04">is not discounted in the marketplace now</text>
  <text start="497.4" dur="9.21">Greenspan he is saying that over the</text>
  <text start="501.51" dur="8.37">last two years this bond bubble is much</text>
  <text start="506.61" dur="5.94">more dangerous than what is going on in</text>
  <text start="509.88" dur="4.68">the stock market and he&amp;#39;s not the only</text>
  <text start="512.55" dur="3.27">one in recent months there&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="514.56" dur="3.75">growing number of those who are</text>
  <text start="515.82" dur="5.099">concerned that the real bond yield in</text>
  <text start="518.31" dur="5.4">the u.s. the UK the EU and elsewhere</text>
  <text start="520.919" dur="5.821">well they&amp;#39;re well below where growth and</text>
  <text start="523.71" dur="6.42">inflation rates seem to suggest they</text>
  <text start="526.74" dur="7.17">should be now we&amp;#39;ve been in a period of</text>
  <text start="530.13" dur="5.55">stagnation since 2008 as a consequence</text>
  <text start="533.91" dur="4.08">of the sharp decline of capital</text>
  <text start="535.68" dur="5.07">investment and productivity growth we</text>
  <text start="537.99" dur="6.45">are moving into a different phase of the</text>
  <text start="540.75" dur="8.13">economy to a stagflation not seen since</text>
  <text start="544.44" dur="9.09">the 1970s now think about this once</text>
  <text start="548.88" dur="6.78">again what happened in the 70s we came</text>
  <text start="553.53" dur="6.96">off of the gold standard we were going</text>
  <text start="555.66" dur="7.26">on to a new system and what do we what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="560.49" dur="5.49">happening right now we&amp;#39;re coming off of</text>
  <text start="562.92" dur="6.66">the petro dollar system ready to go on</text>
  <text start="565.98" dur="6.06">to a new system but this time we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="569.58" dur="5.61">the back end there&amp;#39;s 20 trillion plus</text>
  <text start="572.04" dur="5.94">worth of debt interest rates are very</text>
  <text start="575.19" dur="5.19">low wages are declining and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="577.98" dur="4.26">seeing right now is we&amp;#39;ve reached a</text>
  <text start="580.38" dur="5.7">point where we&amp;#39;re at the everything</text>
  <text start="582.24" dur="5.31">bubble back if we go back in time we had</text>
  <text start="586.08" dur="4.95">the dot-com bubble</text>
  <text start="587.55" dur="7.59">back in 2001 we had the housing bubble</text>
  <text start="591.03" dur="6.6">in 2008 we are now above all of those</text>
  <text start="595.14" dur="4.32">bubbles we are at the everything bubble</text>
  <text start="597.63" dur="4.83">and everything is going to be come</text>
  <text start="599.46" dur="6.66">crashing down now it&amp;#39;s hard to believe</text>
  <text start="602.46" dur="5.94">but Greenspan is a Gold Bug even though</text>
  <text start="606.12" dur="5.1">he was with the central bank not too</text>
  <text start="608.4" dur="5.31">fond of him but he is a goal bug and one</text>
  <text start="611.22" dur="5.01">of his quotes is in the absence of the</text>
  <text start="613.71" dur="5.01">gold standard there is no way to protect</text>
  <text start="616.23" dur="5.99">savings from confiscation through</text>
  <text start="618.72" dur="6.57">inflation there&amp;#39;s no safe store of value</text>
  <text start="622.22" dur="7.41">what he&amp;#39;s saying is that you need</text>
  <text start="625.29" dur="10.35">precious metals that is your insurance</text>
  <text start="629.63" dur="10.66">policy when the paper currency basically</text>
  <text start="635.64" dur="9.09">collapses and everyone should insure</text>
  <text start="640.29" dur="8.04">themselves with gold and silver this is</text>
  <text start="644.73" dur="6.03">going to protect everyone now we can see</text>
  <text start="648.33" dur="4.23">the market has hit 22,000 points</text>
  <text start="650.76" dur="3.33">everyone should be clapping now you got</text>
  <text start="652.56" dur="3.36">to remember this is completely</text>
  <text start="654.09" dur="5.07">manipulated I mean think about it the</text>
  <text start="655.92" dur="6.36">Swiss central bank owns a lot of Apple</text>
  <text start="659.16" dur="5.31">stock jap japan they own a lot of the</text>
  <text start="662.28" dur="5.4">corporate stocks it&amp;#39;s all manipulated if</text>
  <text start="664.47" dur="5.34">they didn&amp;#39;t take the nine trillion</text>
  <text start="667.68" dur="5.67">dollars from 2008 to the present time</text>
  <text start="669.81" dur="5.28">and shove that into the stock market</text>
  <text start="673.35" dur="3.81">where they bought a lot of stocks they</text>
  <text start="675.09" dur="4.44">bought a lot of bonds where they bought</text>
  <text start="677.16" dur="4.2">the toxic real estate and we just took</text>
  <text start="679.53" dur="4.17">away that nine trillion what do you</text>
  <text start="681.36" dur="4.14">think the economy would look like now</text>
  <text start="683.7" dur="5.22">that nine trillion bet didn&amp;#39;t reach the</text>
  <text start="685.5" dur="5.57">people the people are struggling what</text>
  <text start="688.92" dur="5.7">they did was they use that nine trillion</text>
  <text start="691.07" dur="6.4">to make everything else look good for</text>
  <text start="694.62" dur="5.37">themselves the stock market looks good</text>
  <text start="697.47" dur="3.81">yes people are benefiting from it a lot</text>
  <text start="699.99" dur="2.4">of people are in it they think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="701.28" dur="3.27">going to keep going higher and higher</text>
  <text start="702.39" dur="2.67">maybe it will but you know what always</text>
  <text start="704.55" dur="3.24">happened</text>
  <text start="705.06" dur="6.15">it comes down eventually we hit that</text>
  <text start="707.79" dur="5.67">point where something just breaks you</text>
  <text start="711.21" dur="4.98">can pretend it&amp;#39;s not going to happen you</text>
  <text start="713.46" dur="4.92">can say look at hit 22,000 now but</text>
  <text start="716.19" dur="5.1">eventually what&amp;#39;s going to happen these</text>
  <text start="718.38" dur="6.06">things come crashing down</text>
  <text start="721.29" dur="5.099">it always happens and this is one</text>
  <text start="724.44" dur="4.86">everyone doesn&amp;#39;t say anything afterwards</text>
  <text start="726.389" dur="4.351">because they were just screwed and this</text>
  <text start="729.3" dur="4.529">is what happened in the Great Depression</text>
  <text start="730.74" dur="4.5">this is what happened in 2008 and this</text>
  <text start="733.829" dur="4.831">is what we&amp;#39;re going to see happen once</text>
  <text start="735.24" dur="6.24">again now Trump is out there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="738.66" dur="4.289">pointing to the stock market saying you</text>
  <text start="741.48" dur="4.83">know the stock market could hit all-time</text>
  <text start="742.949" dur="5.88">highs again twenty-two thousand was</text>
  <text start="746.31" dur="6.209">18,000 only six months ago on election</text>
  <text start="748.829" dur="6.87">day and he&amp;#39;s saying look how great this</text>
  <text start="752.519" dur="5.271">is now a lot of people think that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="755.699" dur="6.661">out there saying that he&amp;#39;s responsible</text>
  <text start="757.79" dur="6.609">now maybe he&amp;#39;s out there saying this but</text>
  <text start="762.36" dur="5.01">I think what he&amp;#39;s doing right now now</text>
  <text start="764.399" dur="6.961">think about this for a second going back</text>
  <text start="767.37" dur="9.42">in time to the present day the corporate</text>
  <text start="771.36" dur="8.58">media the said everyone they&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="776.79" dur="6.39">looked at the stock market and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="779.94" dur="5.19">always gauged everything on what the</text>
  <text start="783.18" dur="3.18">market does actually if you listen to</text>
  <text start="785.13" dur="3.72">the corporate media in the financial</text>
  <text start="786.36" dur="4.02">pundits this is all they talk about how</text>
  <text start="788.85" dur="4.83">great it is if it&amp;#39;s going up it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="790.38" dur="5.819">fantastic so what I think he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="793.68" dur="6">right now because he knows it&amp;#39;s a bubble</text>
  <text start="796.199" dur="5.19">he said it during the election that</text>
  <text start="799.68" dur="3.089">that&amp;#39;s in a bubble housing is in a</text>
  <text start="801.389" dur="7.461">bubble where bubbles all over the place</text>
  <text start="802.769" dur="6.081">he knows it&amp;#39;s a bubble he&amp;#39;s using this</text>
  <text start="808.97" dur="3.46">against them and you&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="810.99" dur="5.579">thinking we&amp;#39;ll ha what do you mean he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="812.43" dur="5.94">using this against him yes he will take</text>
  <text start="816.569" dur="4.651">a little bit of heat when this thing</text>
  <text start="818.37" dur="6.06">comes down but he can always turn around</text>
  <text start="821.22" dur="7.109">and he can always cite his case where</text>
  <text start="824.43" dur="7.83">the Fed the corporate media has always</text>
  <text start="828.329" dur="6.87">said that look at the stock market look</text>
  <text start="832.26" dur="8.67">at the stock market and he can use this</text>
  <text start="835.199" dur="8.25">against them now again he might take a</text>
  <text start="840.93" dur="6.3">little heat for this but it&amp;#39;s an easy</text>
  <text start="843.449" dur="5.94">case to show that their system that</text>
  <text start="847.23" dur="5.849">they&amp;#39;ve been touting about for all these</text>
  <text start="849.389" dur="6.021">years it doesn&amp;#39;t work the stock market</text>
  <text start="853.079" dur="7.711">can go as high as you want it to go</text>
  <text start="855.41" dur="7.42">but it&amp;#39;s meaningless and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="860.79" dur="4.62">are out there they&amp;#39;re thinking that oh</text>
  <text start="862.83" dur="5.52">no he&amp;#39;s on board I really don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="865.41" dur="5.28">he&amp;#39;s on board yes I think he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="868.35" dur="5.61">work with many individuals in government</text>
  <text start="870.69" dur="5.46">but from his actions and what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="873.96" dur="3.93">trying to do and the things that he</text>
  <text start="876.15" dur="4.2">turns around and does and people call</text>
  <text start="877.89" dur="5.19">this flip-flopping it&amp;#39;s because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="880.35" dur="5.99">trying to maneuver around all of this</text>
  <text start="883.08" dur="6.12">now let&amp;#39;s think about this for a second</text>
  <text start="886.34" dur="4.21">sometimes you need to let the children</text>
  <text start="889.2" dur="4.11">and I&amp;#39;m talking about the corporate</text>
  <text start="890.55" dur="6.42">media those individuals in Congress you</text>
  <text start="893.31" dur="8.55">need to show everyone what their</text>
  <text start="896.97" dur="8.28">policies have actually done let them run</text>
  <text start="901.86" dur="6.75">the course and you can turn around and</text>
  <text start="905.25" dur="5.67">say see that didn&amp;#39;t work a lot of</text>
  <text start="908.61" dur="5.58">parents do this with their children go</text>
  <text start="910.92" dur="6.54">ahead try this let me know how it turns</text>
  <text start="914.19" dur="5.91">out they think that you&amp;#39;re behind them</text>
  <text start="917.46" dur="6.06">but you&amp;#39;re trying to show them that it</text>
  <text start="920.1" dur="5.52">doesn&amp;#39;t work and I believe this is what</text>
  <text start="923.52" dur="8.24">he&amp;#39;s been doing because throughout the</text>
  <text start="925.62" dur="9.81">entire what last 100 years 200 years</text>
  <text start="931.76" dur="7.75">this is what the fed this is what the</text>
  <text start="935.43" dur="7.46">deep state has been doing they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="939.51" dur="7.34">using this argument that the market is</text>
  <text start="942.89" dur="8.25">the economy and if we just pump it up</text>
  <text start="946.85" dur="6.91">everything is going to be fine</text>
  <text start="951.14" dur="6.19">everything that we&amp;#39;re doing is for the</text>
  <text start="953.76" dur="8.25">market we&amp;#39;re creating currency to pump</text>
  <text start="957.33" dur="8.34">up the market so what he&amp;#39;s doing right</text>
  <text start="962.01" dur="5.25">now is he setting them all up now a lot</text>
  <text start="965.67" dur="4.08">of people because I know he&amp;#39;s not he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="967.26" dur="4.32">not setting them up that&amp;#39;s impossible he</text>
  <text start="969.75" dur="4.97">loves the market going up yes it makes</text>
  <text start="971.58" dur="6.12">for great press it makes it look like</text>
  <text start="974.72" dur="5.26">he&amp;#39;s going along with this he knows</text>
  <text start="977.7" dur="3.6">what&amp;#39;s going to happen what do you think</text>
  <text start="979.98" dur="2.93">the only people that know what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="981.3" dur="3.81">to happen is the alternative media</text>
  <text start="982.91" dur="4.3">people that are out there talking like</text>
  <text start="985.11" dur="3.779">oK we&amp;#39;ve seen a bubble before the stock</text>
  <text start="987.21" dur="3.27">market has risen it&amp;#39;s dropped we</text>
  <text start="988.889" dur="3.031">another bubble before the stock market</text>
  <text start="990.48" dur="3.779">has risen and dropping think about if</text>
  <text start="991.92" dur="4.229">you go all the way back to 1929 where</text>
  <text start="994.259" dur="3.18">they said wow the market just hit 400</text>
  <text start="996.149" dur="3.451">points we&amp;#39;ve never seen this before</text>
  <text start="997.439" dur="5.07">back in the 70s when it hit a thousand</text>
  <text start="999.6" dur="6.149">points they were having parties when we</text>
  <text start="1002.509" dur="6.031">hit 12,000 points like what 2001 or hit</text>
  <text start="1005.749" dur="3.45">14,000 points in 2008 we&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="1008.54" dur="3.87">this before</text>
  <text start="1009.199" dur="4.95">here we are 20 mm what do you think is</text>
  <text start="1012.41" dur="3.919">going to happen yeah maybe I&amp;#39;ll go up to</text>
  <text start="1014.149" dur="6.12">30,000 maybe I&amp;#39;ll even go up to 40,000</text>
  <text start="1016.329" dur="6.97">but it&amp;#39;s meaningless because the higher</text>
  <text start="1020.269" dur="6.991">it goes the worse off it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="1023.299" dur="5.701">and in the background the economy is</text>
  <text start="1027.26" dur="2.909">going to be falling apart like we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1029" dur="3.839">been seeing this is what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1030.169" dur="6.42">tracking all throughout this period</text>
  <text start="1032.839" dur="6.421">think about it from 2008 to now what has</text>
  <text start="1036.589" dur="4.68">happened the markets gone up oh it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1039.26" dur="6.329">gone up people made money of course yes</text>
  <text start="1041.269" dur="6.801">it&amp;#39;s gone up again but when you look</text>

  <text start="1051.409" dur="6.5">we&amp;#39;ve lost manufacturing jobs retail</text>
  <text start="1055.159" dur="5.341">stores started to close down that</text>
  <text start="1057.909" dur="4.661">accelerated as we move forward because</text>
  <text start="1060.5" dur="4.32">remember right now and I saw a new</text>
  <text start="1062.57" dur="6.27">report on a retail and online sales</text>

  <text start="1068.84" dur="6.15">entire retail market and the retail</text>
  <text start="1070.85" dur="6.39">market is a trillion-dollar business so</text>
  <text start="1074.99" dur="7.35">when they talk about billions of dollars</text>
