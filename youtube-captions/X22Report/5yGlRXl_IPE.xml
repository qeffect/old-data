  <text start="203.71" dur="4.41">is saying and it&amp;#39;s funny because the Fed</text>
  <text start="206.23" dur="3.9">is saying completely something opposite</text>
  <text start="208.12" dur="5.339">I mean this year they&amp;#39;re talking about</text>

  <text start="595.33" dur="3.93">that their way of life has completely</text>
  <text start="597.25" dur="5.37">changed and if you try to tell these</text>
  <text start="599.26" dur="4.92">people that you know this is where we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="610.24" dur="6.57">and this is just the way it&amp;#39;s been and I</text>
  <text start="613" dur="6.21">feel like the Fed and the central banks</text>
  <text start="616.81" dur="5.33">have brainwashed us into believing this</text>
  <text start="619.21" dur="5.76">that everything always gets expensive</text>

  <text start="624.97" dur="4.32">know up and down swing and I think we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="627.34" dur="4.86">been completely brainwashed for this</text>
  <text start="629.29" dur="7.65">collapse so we&amp;#39;re none the wiser of</text>
  <text start="632.2" dur="7.41">what&amp;#39;s really going on and I mean I mean</text>
  <text start="636.94" dur="5.13">you could tell things are out of whack</text>
  <text start="639.61" dur="4.83">when the New York Times comes out that</text>
  <text start="642.07" dur="5.01">we don&amp;#39;t need the Constitution and they</text>
  <text start="644.44" dur="4.47">have this law professor come on and tell</text>
  <text start="647.08" dur="4.32">you why we don&amp;#39;t need the Constitution</text>
  <text start="648.91" dur="6">well the Constitution is the backbone of</text>
  <text start="651.4" dur="6.69">America that&amp;#39;s what America was built on</text>
  <text start="654.91" dur="6.54">that&amp;#39;s why we had the revolution that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="658.09" dur="5.97">why we are the way we are today except</text>
  <text start="661.45" dur="5.19">that we&amp;#39;re not actually following the</text>
  <text start="664.06" dur="4.09">full Constitution we&amp;#39;re kind of veering</text>
  <text start="666.64" dur="5.23">off a little bit and</text>
  <text start="668.15" dur="7.56">and making up not us but other people</text>
  <text start="671.87" dur="6.63">government central bank fed making up</text>
  <text start="675.71" dur="6.96">laws on their own so they don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="678.5" dur="5.55">deal with the Constitution I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="682.67" dur="4.35">funny because you know when we talk</text>
  <text start="684.05" dur="5.28">about the Constitution we talk about you</text>
  <text start="687.02" dur="4.65">know the the Second Amendment with the</text>
  <text start="689.33" dur="3.66">the right to bear arms we talk about the</text>
  <text start="691.67" dur="4.7">first manner of freedom of speech and</text>
  <text start="692.99" dur="6.3">and when we talk about gun control and</text>
